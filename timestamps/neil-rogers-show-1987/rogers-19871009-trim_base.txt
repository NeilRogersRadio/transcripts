[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.980]
The media is sick and needs help badly.

[00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.080]
What's Gary doing tonight?

[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.780]
And calling minds want to know?

[00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.160]
That's why inquiring minds read the Miami hero.

[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.520]
Is Maurice Fere really having sex with an alien from outer space?

[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.440]
It's in the harem.

[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.580]
Is Paula Hawkins the true mother of the elephant man?

[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.520]
It's in the harem.

[00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.340]
Is John Kennedy sleeping with Max Henry?

[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:28.540]
It's in the harem.

[00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.220]
Is Jim Baker about to give birth to Jerry Ballwell's baby?

[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.120]
It's in the harem.

[00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.340]
Sex, sex, sex, more, hot, sex.

[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.580]
Oh, it's in the harem.

[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.920]
Plus Gary Hart's amazing right style from Florida.

[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.720]
A crossword puzzle that has no answers.

[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.720]
Our own punitive prizes just for us.

[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.480]
I'd post love letters to Neil Rogers.

[00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.840]
And we're so sorry Uncle Albert, but we haven't heard of bloody thing all day.

[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.080]
Mindless, badly rhetoric.

[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.160]
It's all in the latest issue of the Miami hero.

[00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.820]
Available at Supermarket checkout counters everywhere.

[00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.440]
And where finer manure is spread.

[00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.180]
We're satisfied they were Iranian.

[00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.680]
Winged going, winged.

[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.740]
Burn, baby.

[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:01.840]
Taw.

[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.480]
How about if we just placed up all day?

[00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.000]
Wouldn't that be good?

[00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.780]
That would be great.

[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.620]
What a show.

[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.400]
Well, here we are.

[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.540]
Eight minutes past 10 at W.I.N.Z.

[00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.600]
And Laurie Shepherd said that this was my last day on W.I.N.Z.

[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.240]
So I guess tomorrow I kind of stay home.

[00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.260]
Sounds good to me, Laurie.

[00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.900]
I like that.

[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.480]
My kind of talk, you know, schedule.

[00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.460]
Two days a week and that's it.

[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.240]
This is working.

[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.160]
Sounds like they're giving you.

[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.820]
You're on the air.

[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.800]
They're giving you to boot meal.

[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.440]
Don't show your ass to America again.

[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.920]
Would you please?

[00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.120]
I think I have a cute butt.

[00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.400]
Especially since you're still going to be working.

[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.360]
It would be who you would try to remain a little bit credible.

[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.200]
Oh, I see.

[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.080]
Or become a little bit credible.

[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.240]
I didn't know I had anything to begin with.

[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.560]
Become a little bit credible.

[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.640]

[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.680]
And who does the imitation of me over there on the FM?

[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.920]
Speaking of a little bit credible.

[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.380]
There he is, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.100]
Now, what are you going to do?

[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.260]
You're going to stay here all day now?

[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.880]
He's up early.

[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.460]
All right.

[00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.320]
It's about time.

[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.740]
I mean, all of the days that I've been here from 9 in the morning,

[00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:57.540]
you'll six at night.

[00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.020]
And wouldn't you know, here he comes trying to salvage a little goodwill

[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.920]
for my audience.

[00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.480]
I'm a desperation.

[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.280]
Can I do it once?

[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.940]
I just want to do once.

[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.120]
Where's the other chairs that belong?

[00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.940]
I just want to do it once.

[00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.420]
Oh, we already took those down here.

[00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.800]
Oh, there's one over here.

[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.400]
They haven't already been moved.

[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.260]
We needed more comfortable chairs over there.

[00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.880]
Yes, Scott.

[00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.080]
Yeah, we don't want to say just once.

[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.580]
Can I say just once?

[00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.720]
You can do anything you want.

[00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.260]
Mobile.

[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.160]
Mobile.

[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.400]
Just one.

[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.460]
I feel better now.

[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.400]
Do you want me to cart that up for you?

[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.340]
Yeah, please.

[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.100]
That would be good.

[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.080]
In stereo, please.

[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.200]
We have good equipment up there.

[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.520]
Okay.

[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.580]
We don't use this mono crap.

[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.500]
Anyway, last night was a big nighted pomp and a park.

[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.260]
It could have been a little bit bigger, but in the fifth race,

[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.660]
I had won the first four in a row.

[00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.000]
I was hot as a pistol.

[00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.800]
And the fifth race, I've got marked on my program, 1, 2, 4, 8.

[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.320]
I know this interest you, you know,

[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.360]
it makes me, oh, and I go to the window.

[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.560]
I'm going to box the 1, 2, 4, 8 in the trine.

[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.880]
I cross it out at the window and I put the two on top.

[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.880]
And it comes in 4, 2, 1, 8 and pays $752,

[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.720]
which caused great pressure on my part for the future of my life.

[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.200]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.020]
I haven't.

[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.720]
Great, great gastric distress.

[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.140]
But that's an understanding.

[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.760]
How was it?

[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.640]
How was it?

[00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:10.120]
Great time.

[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.280]
Dinner was excellent.

[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.700]
Okay.

[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.100]
And the J-Mikeles was there and I invited J-D come in here sometime today

[00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.480]
and give a little BS to the audience.

[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.760]
He's not wearing a suit today.

[00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.400]
He has his bowling shirt on.

[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.060]
Oh, yeah.

[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.180]
He'll fit right in with this crap.

[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.720]
That's good.

[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.120]
Now, what is it that you guys want to cry about?

[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.420]
You mean crying for the last three weeks?

[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.200]
We're not crying for the last three weeks.

[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.840]
You're crying for the last three weeks.

[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:30.140]
You're crying for the last three weeks.

[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.620]
No, I didn't hear.

[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.340]
I was in there.

[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.440]
We thought it like it is.

[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.980]
I was in a very heavy, appropriate meeting.

[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.340]
We said you're going to kick butt.

[00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.620]
There's going to be a lot of people in South Florida morning people out of work.

[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:39.620]
That's the story.

[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.900]
That's the last three and a half weeks.

[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.380]
Yeah, that's the joke.

[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.900]
It's the radio show, right?

[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.680]
Just a joke.

[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.400]
We did it just so we could offend Glenn.

[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:49.380]
Speaking of jokes.

[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.360]
Okay, by the way, we have something special for you.

[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.200]
See, the one thing we've got, and we may not have a lot, but one thing we do have going,

[00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.360]
we have a very creative audience.

[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.600]
We also have a lot of other stations in the market that like to put their material on our show

[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.900]
because they know somebody will hear it.

[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.060]
That may stop.

[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.340]
That may stop.

[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.120]
Possibly stop.

[00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.680]
Do you think so?

[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.040]
No, I do.

[00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.680]
Yeah, no, I'm sure it'll continue right on.

[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.460]
But yesterday I had this brainstorm for a great record.

[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.460]
Is Joey cute up here?

[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:16.360]
No, he's still young.

[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:16.880]
He's going.

[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.780]
Check it out, he reached over and stopped it.

[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.160]
I don't want to get on the floor this morning.

[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.900]
You know that last night Alan Finkelson at the track came running over to me and he said,

[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.960]
who the hell is this Joey Reynolds guy?

[00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.920]
I said, what do you mean?

[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.980]
He said he's here, he downstairs somewhere, and he wants to challenge you to a race.

[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.420]
He was there.

[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.040]
Yeah, I wanted to come upstairs and challenge me to a race.

[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.680]
He can't go upstairs, can he?

[00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:43.460]
Well, his walk.

[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.420]
Not looking like that.

[00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.340]
Get up the stairs.

[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.340]
Not looking like that.

[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.260]
He is well on the way.

[00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.760]
You know, they have a special senior citizen's group downstairs.

[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.260]
There's a special spot for seniors.

[00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.140]
Yeah, he was in the scene just.

[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.080]
But can you believe that?

[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.220]
I mean, talk about desperation and looking for publicity and the game.

[00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.140]
Did Jamie show up?

[00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.860]
No.

[00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.200]
Oh.

[00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.620]
No, they're busy cooking up dinner for the weekend.

[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.680]
I feel bad.

[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:02.900]
I mean, this guy works here all the time.

[00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.040]
He's in the chair to sit.

[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.460]
Well, why don't you let him have a chair?

[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.440]
We can play musical chairs.

[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.360]
Why don't you let your elder have a chair?

[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.640]

[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.140]
If he just moved, everybody would go to a chair.

[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.400]
All the blood rushing to a chair.

[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.900]
That's sort of like a musical chairs time.

[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:15.340]
Yeah, that's good.

[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.440]
Move those down one step.

[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.960]
Okay.

[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.600]
Anyway, I want you to listen very carefully because I said, you know, everybody knows Willie Nelson

[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.420]
on the road again.

[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.460]
And I was thinking of a song that would fit our feathered friend over here because if you've

[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.460]
ever noticed him sitting in the office, the phone grows onto the ear.

[00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:30.620]
I want to hear you.

[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.800]

[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.540]
And he wasn't on the phone and I collapsed.

[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.040]
It's a miracle.

[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.480]
Yeah.

[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.140]
It sounds like they're talking about somebody that Glenn and I know at another station.

[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.300]
Oh, yeah.

[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.860]
You notice even when he comes on the A and he talks off Mike.

[00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.540]
I know what that is.

[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.600]
I know what that is.

[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.780]
I know what it is.

[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:44.320]
I know what it is.

[00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.040]
That's your stick.

[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.720]
And of course, it's better when they can't hear you.

[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.540]
You want to tell you.

[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.360]
All right.

[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.860]
Now listen, we have a listener whose name is George Boothroyd.

[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.360]
Of course, when you got a name like that, you got to change it about that.

[00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.740]
And he brought this in this morning and this is just for you.

[00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.660]
He brought it in.

[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:00.900]
Listen.

[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.460]
Okay.

[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.920]
Down the phone again.

[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.900]
Hey, that birdies on the phone again.

[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.500]
The light below this sitting talking with his friends.

[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.040]
Hey, that's the birdies on the phone again.

[00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.600]
Down the phone again.

[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.160]
He can't even talk while driving down that highway.

[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.260]
The top man.

[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.940]
Yes.

[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.540]
Until he pulls into his driveway.

[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.700]
By the way, he's on the phone again.

[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.640]
Yeah, that's the birdies on the phone again.

[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:51.000]
Is that a growth or just a receiving end of that phone that he's on again?

[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.420]
But the birdies on the phone again.

[00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.840]
Hey, Neil, he's perched upon that phone again.

[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.020]
Yeah, that could be in the top five by next week, I think, on Zeta.

[00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.020]
Yes, in the stereo.

[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.940]
So you guys are going to be in stereo in a few days.

[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:14.360]
Wow.

[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.400]
Would he be decided who's on the right and who's on the left?

[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:17.860]
It's a little bit.

[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:18.720]
I'm going to be on one end.

[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.440]
He's going to be way on the other end and lead you.

[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.420]
That will be somewhere in the middle.

[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.020]
I'm going to call that yesterday and say.

[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.140]
Or did I have that the wrong way?

[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:25.580]
No, I'm sorry.

[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:26.840]
You're going to be somewhere in the middle.

[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.880]
Sorry, we're such a big man that they ought to go back to Quad.

[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:32.660]
Yeah.

[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.780]
There must be the guy who used to be on the FM from Quad Cities.

[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:36.540]
Right.

[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:37.660]
From Davenport.

[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.460]
Yeah, this corporation loves Davenport Iowa when they got a thing.

[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.200]
So anyway, you guys were saying what?

[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.520]
No, we were just observing the genius.

[00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:52.660]
I just wanted to say that I thought it was great how the past few weeks that you've had

[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:53.780]
other morning shows.

[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.620]
I mean, you knew about this all the time.

[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.060]
Oh, sure.

[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.260]
You were going to do this.

[00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:57.920]
You're milking it.

[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.040]
I knew about it about a day after you did it.

[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.120]
You know the way this company works.

[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.360]
How the morning shows have been talking about you for the best of a week?

[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.480]
You know that guy can't it could make a lot of money growing mushrooms because they're good at keeping everything in the dark.

[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.280]
So it's true.

[00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:14.680]
In fact, I noticed that Gary was out smoking mushrooms in the backyard just before he came in.

[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:15.880]
Unbelievable.

[00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:16.820]
He's had a rough week.

[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.140]
You know, the one day that they had him, he had himself locked in the John.

[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:19.520]
Yeah.

[00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:20.380]
And he wouldn't.

[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.980]
And 16 people were trying to get him to come out.

[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:23.720]
He wouldn't come out.

[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:29.760]
And of course, it's fitting that this is our last week day on WINZ before moving over to Zeta 4.

[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:30.960]
And we are pretty nice.

[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.160]
You're fighting once over here.

[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.100]
We're delighted to have you.

[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:38.040]
And as I said, I'd be delighted to take off and let you guys really show your thing to the world.

[00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.480]
But that's another story.

[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.180]
I already showed it to him.

[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:42.580]
But anyway, well, I was thinking of something else.

[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.000]
What time of day you're going to be on the radio?

[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.240]
Is it going to be just on the Monday?

[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.600]
Well, I'm not really sure you're going to be on the radio for a time of summer.

[00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:51.740]
Just on the one day, isn't it?

[00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:53.420]
The book comes out today.

[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.300]
You are aware of that.

[00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:55.020]
Oh, good.

[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.580]
Yeah, the summer book.

[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.220]
I know you.

[00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:58.220]
I've got a big book.

[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.240]
Yeah, we're up for big bonuses on day.

[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:00.500]
Oh, boy.

[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:04.940]
Now, what do you want to give you a little insight as to what the business is all about?

[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.520]
Okay, now I haven't signed my contract yet for the FMO.

[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.000]
Okay, and these guys are with our big books.

[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:10.800]
But yeah, right.

[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:11.500]
Good man.

[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:12.200]
Big bucks.

[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.280]
Sure, you should listen along.

[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:14.060]
You got a milk on them.

[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:15.480]
I know you're not working weekends anywhere.

[00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:15.960]
That's great.

[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.440]
Yeah, well, let's see.

[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.100]
That's in place of like 50 grand.

[00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:19.720]
What about you?

[00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:20.380]
I work in Saturday.

[00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:22.220]
What do you guys are doing breakfast with the betrances?

[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.680]
Starting next week, you're doing a real surprise for you.

[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:26.200]
And Peter.

[00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:26.480]
Yeah.

[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:28.720]
Can we mention other morning people?

[00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:29.300]
Sure.

[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.160]
You mentioned anything you want.

[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:30.740]
But wait a minute.

[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:36.160]
So anyway, this morning, I was supposed to go in there and we were going to like finalize

[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.540]
everything I had all this stuff laid out.

[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.080]
A little proposal for, you know, how many million they were going to pay me.

[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.620]
And of course, it's predicated.

[00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:47.280]
The incentive part is predicated on those massive 25 to 54 numbers that they had in the morning

[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:47.700]
before.

[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:49.660]
Like what?

[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.920]
Well, where there's six people or four seven.

[00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:56.280]
And of course, now the response I get is well, we'll deal with that later when you get

[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.680]
out there because of course the new numbers coming today will take a look at those.

[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:00.140]
Right.

[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:05.060]
So like they're in there praying and holding their little increase to try to goose me up a little

[00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:05.500]
bit, you know?

[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.880]
Boy, what a company, huh?

[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:09.060]
No, what an outfit.

[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:09.680]
What a business.

[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.680]
I mean, Craig, he can make 300 cheese.

[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.240]
Is that disgusting or what?

[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:14.800]
That's really more power to him.

[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.640]
I listened to the audience shows for the first time.

[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:17.040]
He's not his power.

[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.080]
There's two put over there.

[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.120]
I know that exactly.

[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.620]
I think he's worth 30.

[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:23.400]
I listened to the morning shows for the first time.

[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.420]
Oh, did you hear Joey?

[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:24.960]
Yeah.

[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.340]
Oh, boy.

[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.020]
He was, he was good this morning.

[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:33.400]
We heard him do the, he says, I got a joke for you, the people in the control room.

[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.480]
He says, I've got a great idea for an invention.

[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.820]
Get dog contact lenses and put little cats on them.

[00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.460]
That joke was stolen from HBO about 10 years.

[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:47.340]
We chuckle.

[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.080]
There's only one race we want you to join Joey.

[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.280]
It's the human race.

[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.900]
Okay, 10, 18 at WINZ.

[00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:59.940]
We got a whole cast of misfits here today.

[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.040]
We're all sitting around very anxiously wondering what's going to happen.

[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.360]
We're all still employed, right?

[00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:05.620]
Everybody here is still employed.

[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.200]
Oh, it's over Stan.

[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:07.860]
He doesn't know yet.

[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:09.500]
But I'm doing weekends.

[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:10.720]
I'm looking forward to that.

[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:11.800]
What's wrong with that?

[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:12.780]
I'm doing something.

[00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:13.540]
Weakens are good.

[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:14.520]
There's nobody else here.

[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.900]
Well, I've got my other things that I do during the week.

[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.460]
You got your thing and we got our thing.

[00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.080]
You know, they were the twain.

[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:21.600]
Never the twain.

[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.560]
It's one of my favorite ones.

[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.920]
No, I'm finished as of Monday.

[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.520]
That's what Steve Keen said.

[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.860]
What are you on Stan?

[00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:32.420]
We're going to just put a shutdown, the radio station.

[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.060]
Neils, are you going to be on Zeta every day?

[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.420]
Well, I'm not sure.

[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:39.640]
Yeah, we'll see how it goes Monday.

[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.200]
Okay.

[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:44.980]
All right, let's take a break and let's try to calm down and bring back a little decor

[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.060]
on respectability here.

[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:46.320]
Okay.

[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:47.960]
It's 10.19.

[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.480]
Got to do a lot of time checks.

[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:49.840]
Okay.

[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:50.900]
A lot of time checks.

[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.780]
Yeah, you got any idea what the temperature is?

[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:53.660]
I'm going to go get that.

[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:54.360]
You got to do the way.

[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.980]
You just make it up.

[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.000]
It's about 78.

[00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:58.460]
It's about 78.

[00:11:59.020 --> 00:11:59.020]

[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.160]
It's about 70.

[00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:00.660]
Yeah.

[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.400]
It's like the time they give on it.

[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:03.660]
It's about 10 o'clock, you know.

[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:04.860]
A little after.

[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.000]
Yeah, it's a little after like they do on Hot 105.

[00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:07.980]
I love that.

[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.820]
I looked at my watch that there was seven past nine.

[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.360]
It's a little after nine o'clock.

[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.680]
You know, they figure what you're doing mushrooms.

[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:16.580]
What difference does it make with timidness?

[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.040]
You know, okay, it is.

[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.240]
And of course the people listening to that scratch music,

[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.240]
do they know what time it is?

[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:21.720]
Or day.

[00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:24.960]
Maybe we ought to start on a first record, Chicago.

[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.500]
Does anybody know what time it is?

[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:26.940]
That would be.

[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.340]
We're going to just give them a month.

[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:28.900]
Yeah.

[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.500]
Yeah, it's somewhere around the middle of October, do it.

[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.160]
We'll come right back.

[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:33.460]
Yeah.

[00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.820]
This is the Neolotcher Show.

[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.600]
This is your brain.

[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:41.560]
Any question?

[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.640]
What are you looking for, Stan?

[00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:45.180]
Astray.

[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:45.380]

[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:46.580]
How about this one right here?

[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:47.320]
There's only one.

[00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.240]
Well, they keep taking them out.

[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:51.000]
They don't want you to keep munging up the studio.

[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:51.760]
Okay.

[00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.220]
Oh, by the way, are we allowed to smoke in the FM?

[00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:55.400]
No, no.

[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:55.860]
No.

[00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:56.960]
Big faux pas.

[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.280]
Oh, is there any considering now?

[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:01.760]
I think that could do it.

[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.120]
I think you guys are safe, yeah.

[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.740]
You know, the interesting part of it is I haven't signed anything yet.

[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.380]
That's the humorous part of the idea.

[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:08.920]
Good.

[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.360]
I could back out at any moment.

[00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:11.600]
I haven't put a week in shift.

[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:12.360]
I haven't signed any news.

[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.000]
I mean, as you suppose the numbers come out in a minute,

[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.260]
you get like a six or something more.

[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.340]
We weren't there during the summer.

[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.820]
Oh, that's the only thing I could bring back whoever was.

[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:19.800]
One third of the last week.

[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:20.200]
Who was there?

[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.880]
Gene was there in the summer.

[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:22.720]
And Jeff.

[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.860]
We started in the beginning of September.

[00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:25.600]
Four weeks.

[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:26.720]
We were on for the last two.

[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.520]
You think the least you could do is give me a light if you're going to give me a cigar, you know what I'm saying?

[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.680]
Well, if we sound like we're a little loose this morning, it's because we are.

[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:37.700]
And with the food that just came in, everybody could be re-illused by noon, you know what I mean?

[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:41.600]
We enjoyed the retrospective, you guys, gave up your four weeks on the air.

[00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.420]
All the three weeks.

[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:43.920]
Three weeks.

[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:44.060]
Three weeks.

[00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:44.400]
Three weeks.

[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:45.660]
Three weeks.

[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.900]
The memory just flooded back into my head.

[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:49.520]
The quality comedy.

[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:50.600]
It just got its greatest hits.

[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.000]
Oh, it was quality comedy it was.

[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.000]
Three weeks on the air and they do a retrospective.

[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.420]
What is that thing by the way here?

[00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:58.560]
That's all right.

[00:13:58.580 --> 00:13:59.120]
I've joined him.

[00:13:59.420 --> 00:13:59.760]
Wait a minute.

[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:01.200]
Where is it?

[00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:02.040]
Oh, that's good.

[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:02.860]
What is it?

[00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:05.720]
He just ate up the cart that we gave him.

[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.340]
No, I didn't eat it up.

[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.160]
You didn't cue it up.

[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:07.940]
That was a gift.

[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:08.920]
You didn't cue it up.

[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:09.760]
Oh, maybe I did.

[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.920]
That's why our weekend is.

[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:12.900]
What a long brain.

[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:13.780]
That's why our ratings failed.

[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.300]
No wonder you're not on the air anymore.

[00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:16.760]
They've had it out in the past 10 years today.

[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.420]
Did you not re-cue Crowded House?

[00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.480]
I haven't played Crowded House in months.

[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.080]
We know who we know who we're here.

[00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:23.140]
Want to listen to a little bit?

[00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:23.680]
Hey, listen.

[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.220]
I played stuff yesterday.

[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.920]
Everything in here is like in the middle.

[00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.540]
So I guess somebody on the weekend, we don't want to mention any names.

[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:30.740]
But that's something.

[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:31.340]
Oh, here it is.

[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:32.200]
A cute up, okay?

[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.560]
The audience is used to this style.

[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.060]
In fact, the audience sends this stuff on cart.

[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:38.320]
I don't know where the hell they get them.

[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:38.800]
Am I right?

[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:39.820]
A cute heart.

[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.320]
They're not going to waste our time.

[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:41.940]
It's an emergency.

[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:43.600]
Mr. Roger.

[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.040]
Mr. Roger.

[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.120]
Mr. Roger.

[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:46.400]
Mr. Roger.

[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:46.840]
Mr. Roger.

[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:47.020]
Mr. Roger.

[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.460]
Do you have anything to say about the assassination of the breakfast clock?

[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:52.220]
Unbelievable.

[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:54.080]
That's quality.

[00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:58.640]
One of the main things we had asked over the past few days when people realized that you were

[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.180]
taking over the breakfast club or whatever was is Neil.

[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.940]
Is Neil going to play music?

[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.520]
That's one of the main questions they had.

[00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:07.460]
And we want to be really.

[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:07.820]
Very, very.

[00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:08.740]
Very rarely.

[00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:09.740]
Is he going to do that?

[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:10.560]
Talk thing.

[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.120]
Yeah, we're doing a call to you too, everyone.

[00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:13.880]
What is this?

[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:15.060]
What's this for?

[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:15.800]
Oh, I don't know.

[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:16.200]
That's just.

[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.200]
Oh, I don't play that.

[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:17.980]
Okay.

[00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:19.040]
Is there something dying here?

[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.880]
Oh, it's the cigars.

[00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:22.580]
We.

[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.840]
Yeah, somebody died on the window in the newsroom.

[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:26.480]
The other party.

[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.660]
The cigars, you guys are smoking.

[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.240]
That word quality can get you.

[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:33.180]
And what it needed to do is that you think we're saying quality rock and roll or is it a

[00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:33.860]
Zeta link?

[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.400]
We got that straight in the peak right away.

[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.800]
I want to be a program meetings when this is a Zeta link.

[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.920]
Are you coming to the program meetings when we're there?

[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:41.500]
No chance.

[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.280]
You're going to run down all the connoisseurs.

[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.280]
We have nothing to do with the rest of the radio station.

[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.040]
Okay, we will promote it and we will pray for it.

[00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:49.040]
That got only nose.

[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:50.700]
But that's it.

[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:51.640]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:51.780]

[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.180]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:53.300]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:53.900]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:54.920]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:55.440]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:55.540]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.320]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:57.680]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:58.280]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:00.040]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:00.660]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:01.780]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:03.420]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.140]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:15.260]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.100]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:30.120]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:30.120]

[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:30.180]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:30.180]

[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:30.180]

[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:30.180]

[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:30.180]

[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:30.180]

[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:30.240]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:30.240]

[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:30.240]

[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:30.440]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.180]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:33.020]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:38.820]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:39.320]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:40.340]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:44.140]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:45.240]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.820]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:52.940]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:52.940]

[00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:52.940]

[00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:52.940]

[00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:52.940]

[00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:53.500]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:54.300]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:54.600]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:54.860]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:58.380]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.860]
You're not going to look at that.

[00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:00.940]

You're not going to look at that.

[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.180]
I heard the word is somber.

[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:20.300]
I think it's a good time to find a new time slot.

[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.220]
I think it's a good time to find a new time slot.

[00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:22.500]
I think it's a good time to find another mark.

[00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:22.940]

[00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:22.980]
I think it's a good time to find another mark.

[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:24.680]
I think it's a good time to find another mark.

[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:25.700]
I think it's a good time to find another mark.

[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:26.700]
I think it's a good time to find a new time slot.

[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:26.760]
I think it's a good time to find a new time slot.

[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:26.800]
I think it's a good time to find a new time slot.

[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:27.520]
I think it's a good time to find another mark.

[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.540]
I think it's a good time to find another mark.

[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:37.760]
I think it's a good time to find another mark.

[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:44.260]
I think it's a good time to find another mark.

[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.800]
It's crappy movie reviews that you used to do.

[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:48.280]
Yeah, that's what that's what kept them down.

[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.820]
Oh, TJ Cinnamon's brought those sticky buns again.

[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:51.340]
Oh, God.

[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:51.660]
I see.

[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.460]
I wasn't going to eat anything, but I got to tell you.

[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:54.640]

[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.260]
I can't really.

[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.300]
Oh, boy.

[00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:56.820]
Oh, boy.

[00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:58.340]
I think Joey sent those over, don't you?

[00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:59.160]
Oh, boy.

[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.740]
You're trying to send me into an insulin shock

[00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:01.640]
before Monday morning.

[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:02.420]
Well, I get to get out.

[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:03.500]
A lot of people are concerned.

[00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:04.580]
Hey, good luck.

[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:05.960]
You'll be glad to make a job.

[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.080]
I'm auditioning for an FBI agent on Vice in about an hour.

[00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:13.760]
No, it's an FBI agent portraying a record rep.

[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.220]
I've got to get I have to get a lock on that one.

[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:18.360]
Yeah, type cast.

[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:21.080]
So I got to get out.

[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.580]
Let's do one little parting thing for Dave Capredi here.

[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:24.620]
Okay, thank you.

[00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:26.680]
This is the Neal Rogers show.

[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.480]
This is your brain.

[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:32.420]
Any question?

[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.620]
I've got a lot of qualms.

[00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:37.060]
The music has been your own laughing, but I'm serious.

[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.760]
That is a classic.

[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:40.120]
I know.

[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.800]
And he may be in the anals of a broadcasting history.

[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:43.480]
What?

[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:44.740]
I'm serious.

[00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:45.140]
I'm serious.

[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.880]
Well, you ought to know something about that.

[00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.220]
I love stains on the window.

[00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:50.280]
I can't believe it.

[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:50.940]
It's disgusting.

[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:51.520]
That's right.

[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.760]
There are two cheek marks up there.

[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.280]
Do you want to meet a joint of them?

[00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:54.780]
No.

[00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.340]
Well, I have promised to promote Guns or Show a lot,

[00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:00.880]
but I'm still deliberating about that two to six show in the afternoon.

[00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:01.420]
He needs it.

[00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:02.780]
Okay, see you guys later.

[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.200]
Good luck.

[00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:03.620]
Good luck.

[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.300]
We'll drop in on you once a week.

[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:06.080]
Thank you so much.

[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:07.660]
Hey, listen, the more the merrier.

[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.980]
I mean, at least now you'll have an audience.

[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:11.860]
So there's food up there.

[00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:14.740]
So maybe you want to rip half of it off before it winds up back here.

[00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:15.100]
Okay.

[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.220]
Look at that.

[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.220]
Even Glenn is leaving now.

[00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:20.660]
You know why I said there's food up front.

[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.860]
You ever see a move so fast?

[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.160]
Right.

[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:23.560]
Cinnamon rolls.

[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:24.880]
It's funny because he said before.

[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.700]
Gee, it's only 10 o'clock in the morning when he heard that there was food up there.

[00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:28.900]
Cinnamon rolls.

[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.340]
So what is it that you really said about Sally Fitz?

[00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.440]
Every day there's another crisis.

[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.320]
I knew nothing about this, but I was sitting in there minding my own business.

[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.840]
And, uh, my prefer we wouldn't discuss it.

[00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:44.440]
Oh, I see.

[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.800]
Well, why didn't you tell me that?

[00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:46.720]
Well, I did that.

[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:47.720]
There's so many things you know.

[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.400]
There's so many important people.

[00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:50.060]
Oh, that meeting.

[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.240]
How did you like that meeting this morning?

[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.100]
That was really exciting.

[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.680]
Glenn and I were having quite a dissertation about that.

[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:54.900]
Yeah.

[00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:58.000]
That was a highlight of my day so far.

[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.180]
Of course, I don't work here anymore.

[00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:01.120]
So I don't really care.

[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.260]
You know, I'm going up to the other end of the building.

[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:03.840]
You know what I mean?

[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:04.440]
Well.

[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.860]
If there are people tuning in this morning or wondering.

[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.280]
What time are you going to be on up there?

[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.480]
6 to 10 a.m.

[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:12.260]
Monday through Friday.

[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:13.440]
You know, it's really something.

[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:17.500]
Alan Finkel said at the last night, he said to me, oh, you were going to be up here every

[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:17.960]
night now.

[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.220]
You know, now you're 6 to 10.

[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:20.220]
I'm trying to explain to him.

[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:20.920]
It's in the morning.

[00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:21.340]
Okay.

[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.760]
Alan, of course, doesn't know what 6 in the morning is.

[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:25.180]
And I'm trying to relate.

[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.260]
You know, it's very difficult.

[00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:27.280]
Well, they should have the track.

[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:27.920]
What?

[00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:29.440]
Because the horses are up there.

[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.180]
Yeah, but Alan ain't up there at 6 in the morning.

[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.360]
He's just getting in at that hour, I think.

[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:34.580]
But that's another story.

[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.160]
But to know, we had a pretty good time.

[00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:39.420]
A lot of winners again last night, but only one a few dollars.

[00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:39.460]

[00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:40.400]
Just a very few.

[00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:41.200]
The same thing.

[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:45.200]
That one race, man, I'm going to the window and I'm having, it was disgusting.

[00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:45.840]
Really?

[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.160]
And I changed my mind right at the window and it came in.

[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.900]
In fact, not only the trifecta, but the first four were the four horses I was going to box.

[00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:54.040]
And it paid $752.

[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.280]
That would have made you day.

[00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:59.340]
And Dave was throwing fondue at me for the rest of the evening, but that's way cool.

[00:20:59.520 --> 00:20:59.660]
Yeah.

[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:00.860]
How was the food?

[00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:01.880]
Food was very good.

[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.300]
I had some liver with onions and he had prime rib.

[00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:05.260]
We had an onion soup.

[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:08.400]
And that great cheese that you ought to go up there some night.

[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:09.720]
I'd like to.

[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:10.160]
Yeah.

[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.580]
But with your new hours, I don't know how you're going to do it.

[00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.340]
Don't have to stay the whole card.

[00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:16.280]
Starts 730.

[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.540]
You stay till 1030.

[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.420]
That's about 730.

[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:19.160]
You're not going to rate it at 9?

[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.080]
No, not really.

[00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:20.480]
No.

[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.280]
About 1030 maybe.

[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.080]
1030, get up around 430.

[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:25.820]
That's what?

[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:26.460]
6 hours.

[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.380]
See, when you work mornings, you don't sleep at hours anymore.

[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.280]
You have a whole different schedule.

[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:31.620]
Yeah.

[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.300]
And then maybe you nap a little.

[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:34.200]
Now here's another guest.

[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:38.340]
Boy, I feel like Don McMiddle, Schlameel on the Breakfast Club now.

[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.800]
He's dressing down now that he's going to be a big boy.

[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.680]
And Jay Michael wants to be as sloppy as we are here.

[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:44.040]
And I was just.

[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:48.380]
Jay came along last night just in time to watch me blow that fifth race trifecta.

[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:48.640]
Sure.

[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.040]
I'm still thinking about that.

[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:51.580]
And tragic.

[00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:56.280]
And following it in your tradition, I wrote down the numbers of the trifecta of race.

[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:56.860]
Right before I left.

[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:57.300]
No, seriously.

[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:57.800]
He did.

[00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:59.560]
And I sat down and I parted.

[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.880]
And I said, I blew my brains out, Stan.

[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.800]
And on every race did not win a dime.

[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.360]
Yeah, but that was not a big let's be honest.

[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.220]
It was not a big triumph.

[00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:08.200]
No, it was a big try.

[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.320]
You would have gotten $44.

[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.500]
So Jay, let's not, you know, let's not start exciting.

[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:16.060]
You know, have it even started the show yet and already you're exaggerating.

[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:19.780]
Jay Michael is going to be here starting Monday from 10 to 2.

[00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:23.220]
And we, and also on Saturdays from 6 to 10 a.m. which is disgraceful.

[00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:26.960]
I can't believe they let they con you into doing six days again.

[00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:28.060]
Yeah.

[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:29.060]
That's it.

[00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:30.680]
Very foolish move on your parts.

[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:31.320]
It's not too late.

[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:32.200]
Have you signed anything?

[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.380]
No, nothing is signed yet.

[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:33.800]
There again.

[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.700]
Call them the same position.

[00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:36.900]
Tell them I'll refidage.

[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:40.100]
No, I haven't signed either, but I have a feeling that they will not let me out of the building

[00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:41.320]
today until something happens.

[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:44.660]
But they want to, the others still want.

[00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:46.700]
They want to examine the new book.

[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.940]
They want to give themselves a little more leverage.

[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:52.460]
So that you need to take a like microscope and do one point one instead of a 1.0.

[00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.300]
They're going to have some real serious leverage there.

[00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:56.640]
So what do you think?

[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:57.980]
By the way, I'm moving Saturday.

[00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.960]
You know, nobody knows about that on the area.

[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:01.660]
Are you moving physically moving?

[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.280]
No, I'm moving to Niels Wolf's slot on Saturday.

[00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:05.940]
Oh yeah, 10 to 2.

[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:06.500]
10 to 2.

[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.420]
Oh yeah, we got all kinds of things going on here.

[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:08.680]
It's dangerous.

[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:12.200]
I mean, the excitement in the air around here, you could cut it with a knife, I'm gonna say.

[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:12.600]
I know.

[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.680]
Well, there's some knives and forks right there.

[00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:16.160]
Give it a start.

[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:20.020]
And of course, we want you all to continue in the tradition of sending in all the good food

[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.420]
for Jay Michaels because Jake can pack it away like no six minutes away from everything.

[00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:27.200]
Now, I've got to tell you, see, I've been trying to stay with this weight watchers thing,

[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.260]
but just rip that bag open.

[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.600]
Berg, come on, rip it open.

[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.900]
My diet has worked about as well as yours.

[00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:35.500]
You know, I mean, I go on for about two days and they're great.

[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:38.500]
You know, and you lose five or six pounds, you say, okay, well, I've lost five or six.

[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:39.460]
And I'll game 15.

[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:43.620]
Hey, listen, you can tell Peter Ducin, thanks for the, but we still have the other card from the other day.

[00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:45.500]
Okay, okay, Peter, let's not overdo it.

[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.200]
But thanks for the boy from TJ Cinnamon's.

[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.120]
I can't believe you brought that stuff up.

[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.140]
Now, stand this, you remind you a little of Philadelphia.

[00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:52.980]
Yeah.

[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.140]
Well, you know, the West Coast,

[00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:57.240]
you're always going to remind you a little Philadelphia, doesn't he?

[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.380]
Big on the West Coast.

[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.380]
Told you, Philly, Suck, I've been trying to tell him that.

[00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:02.320]
But he won't believe me.

[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:05.000]
He still has the bruises when he threw them down the steps at Wibbidji.

[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:05.280]
Yeah.

[00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:09.000]
The most fascinating thing is Joy was in Philly for such a long period of time,

[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.140]
and he was never successful.

[00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:10.580]
No.

[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.600]
Well, you never, except for that one.

[00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:14.140]
Except for Buffalo, he's flopped everywhere.

[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:18.660]
He's been New Haven, New York, Philadelphia, that little town, Violin, New Jersey,

[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:20.480]
over the hell of a, I don't know.

[00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:20.580]

[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:22.920]
I write a little column for stage and screen.

[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.920]
I think in the last one, I said, Joey's trademark has been fired

[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.400]
from some of the best stations in the country.

[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:27.680]
Yeah.

[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:32.380]
The incredible part is how they ever hired him in the first place.

[00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:36.160]
Of course, when you're working at WNBC in New York for 80 grand a year, you know.

[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:38.200]
Well, you take a few lumps.

[00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:38.840]
Yeah.

[00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:41.440]
Well, there's some people like that in the business.

[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:44.040]
Actually, Stan's kind of a purest when it comes to cinnamon rolls.

[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:47.880]
He doesn't go for the caramel and the glaze nuts and nuts.

[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.860]
Oh, boy, these are excellent.

[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.980]
You got a long record we can play while we enjoy this.

[00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:53.000]
No, I can eat on here.

[00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.180]
How do you think I'd go out like this?

[00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:58.640]
I can eat all of this is everywhere because Joey's got him coming on the show.

[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.380]
No, I'm not going to play Elvis's everywhere.

[00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:00.820]
Okay.

[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:01.740]
He's got Mr. Morrow.

[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.520]
Go direct your own show.

[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:04.540]
Monos coming on the show.

[00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:06.540]
When you get that show straightened out, then you come to me.

[00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:06.900]
Okay.

[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:08.880]
And I won't stand in all.

[00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:09.780]
I'm not holding my breath.

[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:09.880]

[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:10.860]
I'm still part of some music for him.

[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:11.300]
I don't know.

[00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:13.500]
I don't know the way you think I'm doing it.

[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:13.520]

[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:13.900]
I'm just doing it.

[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:15.520]
I think I'm going to do it by myself.

[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:16.440]
Two hours in the stereo.

[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:16.880]
Would you please?

[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:17.620]
Oh.

[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.440]
Well, you now have to do stereo bits for you guys.

[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:21.040]
Yeah.

[00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:21.960]
Part of the deal.

[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:22.780]
It's part of the plan.

[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.300]
Plays the deal, Parma, John.

[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:26.440]
I want to hear this.

[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:27.700]
I want to hear this one more time.

[00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.940]
Just an honor of our flying feathered friend.

[00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:35.260]
Sound the phone again.

[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:40.260]
Hey, that birdies on the phone again.

[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.640]
The life you love is sitting talking with his friends.

[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:49.320]
Hey, that's the birdies on the phone again.

[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.920]
Sound the phone again.

[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:56.540]
He can't even talk while driving down that highway.

[00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:59.980]
The talking never ends.

[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.920]
That is until he pulls into his driveway.

[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:09.100]
By the way, he's on the phone again.

[00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:14.060]
Yeah, that's the birdies on the phone again.

[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:19.440]
Is that a growth or just a receiving end?

[00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:23.380]
Of that phone that he's on again?

[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.800]
Oh, if they let birdies on the phone again.

[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:33.120]
Hey, Neil, he's perched up on that phone again.

[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.880]
Oh, boy, we're about a half hour away from climax, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:40.140]
Hmm.

[00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:45.100]
At the WNZ computers as the summer book number has come peeping off.

[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:48.040]
Well, listen, today isn't payday.

[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:48.820]
It's next Friday, right?

[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:49.120]
Next Friday.

[00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:51.360]
Well, it might be for some people.

[00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:54.360]
We understand.

[00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:54.640]
Yes.

[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.060]
We heard rumors.

[00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:58.940]
This is the biggest rumor mill in the country.

[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.140]
I think it's unbelievable.

[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:00.720]

[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:04.200]
Oh, I'm not sure that there's some bigger yintis.

[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:06.480]
Although, of course, you kind of wait down the end.

[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:11.420]
It was very interesting, though, as soon as the announcement was public yesterday,

[00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:15.460]
I think everybody came off the beach and used the same payphone there in Hollywood yesterday

[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:18.220]
to call our programming department.

[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:18.580]

[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:19.620]
Oh, you're really high.

[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:20.660]
Real talk show host now.

[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.780]
Like, I'm an old leaf-foward, did he call?

[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:24.640]
No one's...

[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:27.020]
No, he had dinner at Marcy and James.

[00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:27.560]
That's it.

[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.740]
That's the thing of the past, and that's it.

[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:31.660]
Please, on the beach.

[00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:33.880]
Yeah, Lee is taking polls on the beach.

[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:34.540]
Yes, that's it.

[00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:35.060]
Yes.

[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.800]
Still a little javelin out there.

[00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:39.160]
Boy, this T.J. Cinnamon's.

[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:39.600]
Now, where is this?

[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:40.540]
There's one in Kendall.

[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.220]
I think this is a...

[00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:42.680]
Galaria.

[00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:47.120]
You know, see, only one thing about the bird that's all you know is kind of a little bit glant.

[00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:48.220]
I'm telling you face to face.

[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.000]
Now, you always talk about Kenville.

[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:50.700]
Because he lives in...

[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:51.300]
Stop my amy.

[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:51.820]
It's all you know.

[00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:53.260]
He's a service that live in Broward, you know?

[00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:54.800]
You can play in danger, Broward.

[00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:54.900]

[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:55.660]
With real people.

[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.220]
Right, and as you walk in the front door of the Pompo-do-Fashion Square,

[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:01.000]
there's one of these T.J. Cinnamonville.

[00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:01.280]
Oh, really?

[00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:01.740]
Yeah.

[00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:05.640]
Well, they're going to be sending out the boxes of this over every morning for you, Neil.

[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:06.420]
Great.

[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:08.020]
Well, come on, Neil.

[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.000]
That's what we'll put on our long record, like...

[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:12.880]
Brian Annterley and Neil DeNight.

[00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:14.480]
Sir, we have the Carthor Park.

[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:15.280]
The Carthor Park.

[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.460]
Okay, you come to the 4-11 at W-I-N-Z.

[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:20.160]
We're going to have some good fun eating here while you folks listen to this.

[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:22.180]
Leaving so soon?

[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:23.120]
The party.

[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:24.360]
Oh, wow.

[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.480]
How'd you like to come to my place?

[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:26.540]
The Gays of the Stars.

[00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:27.700]
We could watch HBO.

[00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:29.740]
I'm going home to watch Showtime.

[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.080]
What showtime, guys?

[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:31.860]
Exclusives.

[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.960]
Movies you can't get on HBO now.

[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.640]
My terrace provides a very romantic setting.

[00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:38.740]
Showtime gives me a room with a view.

[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.560]
Oh, you could see my art collection.

[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:42.420]
Showtime, that's me, C. Mona Lisa.

[00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:46.200]
What if I take you to my club and introduce you to some famous people?

[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:49.380]
Well, it's Showtime I can spend an evening with roses, people.

[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:50.400]
I'll buy your roses.

[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:51.800]
I prefer the color money.

[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:52.780]
I'm a nice guy.

[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:53.840]
I like tough guys.

[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:54.960]
You could do better.

[00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:55.900]
I doubt it.

[00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:57.420]
Showtime has tough guns.

[00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:00.900]
Showtime has all these movies and a whole lot more.

[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.380]
Exclusives you won't see on other pay services.

[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:05.880]
So if you want these movies, get Showtime.

[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.480]
Showtime has the hits HBO misses.

[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:12.160]
Order Showtime now and catch the Rock and Roll Summit

[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:15.760]
an American Soviet music event and next month's blockbuster hit.

[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:16.260]
Who the fuck?

[00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:17.240]
Booger, man.

[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:19.780]
19 before 11.

[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:20.440]
Oh.

[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:21.720]
You want to look at this.

[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:26.060]
And of course all the traditional hangar around here's mode tech.

[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:27.280]
You're going to miss you.

[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:28.100]
You're going to miss you.

[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:30.360]
You know, you know, you know, I'm over at the FM.

[00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:31.240]
I'll just go be around.

[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.280]
No, you're going to be out on assignment.

[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:35.320]
Yeah, I'll be serving you.

[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.380]
I'm, you know, I'm surprised that you Frank.

[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:38.960]
We're going to send you to the Bahamas.

[00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:39.360]
Frank.

[00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:39.780]
There.

[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:41.060]
Jesus.

[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:42.400]
That sounds me.

[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:43.620]
What did you say?

[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:46.200]
Jesus Louise.

[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:46.900]
Okay.

[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:47.240]
Thanks.

[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:48.500]
God.

[00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:52.220]
You never heard what's his name, the bird.

[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:53.880]
Use a naughty word.

[00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:56.220]
Oh, I have a bet on the air.

[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.760]
Yeah, but on the air.

[00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:58.460]
Yeah, I have.

[00:29:58.460 --> 00:29:58.720]
Have you?

[00:29:58.820 --> 00:29:59.380]
On the air.

[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:00.180]
I had while you were on it.

[00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:00.820]
Can you say crap?

[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:03.480]
I said while you were going to vacation.

[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:04.580]
Can you say kinky?

[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:12.360]
When you were on vacation, I had a something I called the management at gloves 94 who fired me.

[00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:14.080]
Can I say that again?

[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:15.040]
I said it then.

[00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:16.640]
Yeah, let's reminisce about that.

[00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:18.740]
We run that tape back.

[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:21.440]
After we finish reminiscing about the three weeks of the breakfast club.

[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:24.440]
Are you going to do a retro-spective today on the Neorodger?

[00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:25.220]
No.

[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:26.140]
You're not going to do that?

[00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:26.960]
That'll be Monday.

[00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:28.060]
Yeah, Monday.

[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:28.480]
We'll play.

[00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:29.420]
We'll start with Halondale.

[00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:31.860]
Halondale and Jorge.

[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.120]
Remember when?

[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:34.560]
Yeah.

[00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:39.480]
Well, what I think we'll have to do is I'll have to handle it in a withdrawal situation.

[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.260]
Yeah, it's like coming off of a drug.

[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:41.680]
Definitely.

[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:42.820]

[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:45.040]
Do we have a lot of best-up tapes in the programming?

[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.980]
There are a little withdrawal situation.

[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:48.420]
Great moments with me.

[00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:49.720]
And then we'll just...

[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:50.940]
Oh, we got the pig lady.

[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:52.760]
We'll play that one.

[00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:53.100]
Oh, yeah.

[00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:54.320]
Do we have a fiber?

[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:54.500]
Yeah.

[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:55.420]
A fiber can do an hour?

[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:55.840]
Yes.

[00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:57.780]
A fiber can do an hour.

[00:30:58.600 --> 00:30:58.960]
Right?

[00:30:59.520 --> 00:30:59.640]
Yeah.

[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.000]
And Jamie and Marcy can do a half hour.

[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:03.820]
That's the...

[00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:05.360]
Oh, I ended up doing about five minutes Monday.

[00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:07.020]
Yeah, Jamie and Marcy's greatest change.

[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:07.400]

[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.640]
Well, listen, folks, we're still eating.

[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:16.000]
I heard they even try to buy Columbus over Monday.

[00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:18.980]
These cinnamon rolls last a long time, don't they?

[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:21.380]
No, Chris is coming out of the oven.

[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:22.000]
Are you looking for food, too?

[00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:22.760]
Oh, look at this.

[00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:24.560]
Here's Gina now who's trolling for food.

[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:28.040]
She comes to visit us so often when there's no food.

[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:31.340]
She comes in either when Dave is here or when food is here, one or the other.

[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:33.240]
Yeah, she's there.

[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:36.400]
Is that the way I can get her on the air is to have food in here?

[00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:36.640]
Food.

[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:37.800]
Yeah, that's it, huh?

[00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:38.360]
Yeah, that's it.

[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:41.080]
Because I want to audition her for our lean slot, you know.

[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:42.000]
And she wouldn't do it.

[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:42.580]
No chance.

[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:44.520]
I asked.

[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:44.740]
No.

[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:45.560]
She wouldn't come in.

[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.120]
She doesn't have the cheeks for it.

[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.540]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:51.260]
Trust me, she could never, never feel all in seat.

[00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:52.860]
Oh, believe me.

[00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:53.240]
Oh.

[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:54.120]
Thank you, Neil.

[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:55.440]
You're welcome, Gina.

[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:56.120]
Anytime.

[00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:58.600]
Stop by and see us at the other end of the building sometime.

[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:00.900]
I think she'd be very good, don't you?

[00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:01.520]
What?

[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:02.560]
On the air?

[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:04.260]
Well, I don't know if she'd be good or not.

[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:04.920]
She's married.

[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:06.120]
Not yet.

[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:06.820]
Well, I'd take care of that.

[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:08.260]
We're trying to talk her out of it.

[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:08.680]
She says.

[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:09.100]
Good luck.

[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:10.180]
She's trying to go into it.

[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:11.260]
Okay.

[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.900]
Although we did have one of those two guys who were in here the other day,

[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:15.140]
she was feeling them both.

[00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:15.700]
Did you remember that?

[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.140]
When Jay and Scott were here.

[00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:19.220]
How is Scott doing, by the way?

[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:20.120]
Is he okay?

[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:20.920]
Yeah.

[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:22.040]
Okay, good.

[00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:23.240]
Irma says he's fine.

[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:24.500]
Is he really?

[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.340]
Well, we'd like to find out.

[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:27.960]
Can you all hear what he says about her?

[00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:28.560]
I'm sure.

[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:33.640]
David, was it ever revealed, Irma's real...

[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:36.760]
Yes?

[00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:37.920]
What?

[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.280]
I'm digging myself a real hole.

[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:41.180]
Her real bang.

[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:42.340]
Is that her real?

[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:46.640]
Well, Irma is a very well-proportioned young lady.

[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:48.020]
Did that ever come out on the air?

[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:49.660]
This is the most disgusting.

[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:50.820]
All right.

[00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:57.400]
I heard some stories from over traffic before, which I can't divulge for time.

[00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.220]
Well, interesting stories are...

[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:01.560]
There was a presence when Irma is in the room.

[00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:01.840]
Yeah.

[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:03.380]
A large presence.

[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:03.660]
Yes.

[00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:05.980]
You're aware that she's there.

[00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:07.400]
We just say that.

[00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:11.540]
Yeah, you see the guys in the building are all kind of following, hovering around, you know.

[00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:13.160]
Trolling, I think, is the word.

[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:14.160]
A little like food.

[00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:18.220]
Well, we hired Irma because we wanted to prove that the only boobs in the building were not just management.

[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:20.140]
And...

[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.320]
And I think we've done that.

[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:28.400]
Or that the biggest boobs in the building were not there.

[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:29.660]
That was it.

[00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:31.780]
I was searching for it.

[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:32.420]
It was yesterday.

[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:33.900]
She was telling me she has three jobs.

[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:36.680]
And one of them, she says, is telemarketing in the evening.

[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.720]
In addition to here, but then she drafted it that as it...

[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.620]
Well, telemarketing, but that stretches that you could be...

[00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:43.840]
She flies with...

[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.820]
Well, she does this thing on the Home Shopping Network.

[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.140]
I can't say what she sells, but she's on the Home Shopping.

[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.020]
Just a joke, Irma.

[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:51.440]
Come on.

[00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:54.600]
Listen, if they had her selling stuff on the Home Shopping network...

[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:55.140]
They were buying.

[00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:57.380]
I would buy it.

[00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:58.060]
I would buy it stock.

[00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:59.140]
I would buy it stock.

[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:00.240]
Yeah.

[00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:03.020]
Every night.

[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:07.140]
See, that's a problem with these idiots that run these Home Shopping things.

[00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:08.000]
They put these...

[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:08.360]
Oh, no.

[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:09.860]
Nothing's on the air, you know.

[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:10.580]
I mean...

[00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:11.420]
Oh, they're terrible.

[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:12.560]
Boy.

[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.400]
You know, people who didn't make it big in Orlando.

[00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:15.900]
Right.

[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:17.760]
That's exactly right.

[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:19.580]
Without all that false enthusiasm.

[00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:22.380]
And the first one, there's so many of them now.

[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:26.640]
You would think that one of them would have a really dynamite, you know, couple.

[00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:27.140]
Would you?

[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:29.700]
Well, I would if I was running it.

[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:31.220]
That's what they're talking about, Home Shopping Network.

[00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:31.780]
I think we need to...

[00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:32.860]
I need a haircut desperately.

[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:33.960]
I think we ought to get a...

[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.240]
For our first morning on Zaden.

[00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:36.220]
Cut your hair.

[00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:37.280]
How to get my haircut on the air.

[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:38.100]
Great idea.

[00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:40.020]
I wanted to get that on the air.

[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:40.480]
Yeah, it works.

[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:41.100]
Yeah, I know.

[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.300]
I had that thing before too.

[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:42.760]
It's great.

[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.160]
And it's cheap too, because they won't let you...

[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:46.480]
Maybe a little tip, that's better.

[00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:47.040]
That's it.

[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:47.420]
Yeah.

[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:49.580]
A couple of mentions you don't have to.

[00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:50.420]

[00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:53.480]
Do you know how many calls you're going to get from beauty salons now?

[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:54.600]
They give you a little trimming.

[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:55.460]
Yeah.

[00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:57.000]
And the bird too.

[00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:58.000]
A little trimming.

[00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:58.560]
A little trimming.

[00:34:59.000 --> 00:34:59.000]

[00:34:59.000 --> 00:34:59.080]
Yeah.

[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:00.260]
You're putting the feathers a little bit...

[00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:01.220]
Put them around the cuddlebone.

[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:01.860]
Yeah.

[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:05.100]
By the way, I appreciate management getting me that cuddlebone.

[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:06.000]
I'm impressed.

[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:07.460]
It is.

[00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:07.800]
You need it.

[00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:08.660]
Very impressive.

[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:12.260]
Boy, these cinemas were just last and...

[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:12.580]
I know.

[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:13.620]
They're just enormous.

[00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:17.820]
That's sort of my stand-up something else.

[00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:18.980]
Yeah.

[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.620]
Can you tell us about stand?

[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:26.860]
Stand-up, is there anything that I need to know and leading up to your show?

[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:28.160]
Is there anything that...

[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.560]
Yeah, don't talk about Miami Vice.

[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.060]
Don't encourage him.

[00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:32.260]
Don't encourage him.

[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:32.960]
Please, Joe.

[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:33.620]
Don't play any other...

[00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:38.020]
I had people at the track yesterday when I went down to do that drawing begging me, please

[00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:39.120]
don't let him do it again.

[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:42.280]
Do hypnosis with him or something, anything.

[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:45.300]
Well, I think Don's going to call you today.

[00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:48.140]
They were shooting last night at this kaya.

[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:48.860]
All right, wait a minute.

[00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:50.040]
Let's see if he's dying right now.

[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:50.880]
Hello.

[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:51.920]
Here, feel.

[00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:52.720]
Wait a minute.

[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:53.760]
Did you hear that?

[00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:54.640]
Did you hear that?

[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:56.480]
Did you hear that?

[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:56.480]

[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:56.480]

[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:56.480]

[00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:57.020]
Don?

[00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:57.060]

[00:35:59.000 --> 00:35:59.500]
That's him.

[00:35:59.700 --> 00:35:59.820]
Yeah.

[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:00.700]
Did you hear it?

[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:01.380]
Can you hear me?

[00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:02.100]
Yeah, Don.

[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.180]
Concealing your hair to no changes.

[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:10.220]
That's it.

[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:12.640]
You know, that's a deep throat.

[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:13.500]
Oh, yeah.

[00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:15.900]
I know that I can be able to call you anymore.

[00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:17.480]
Of course, I'm not going to be able to call you any less.

[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:21.560]
Um, listen, congratulations on your victory move.

[00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:23.840]
You've done something that no one has done before.

[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:24.620]
What is it?

[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:26.020]
We've rechanged his underwear.

[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:29.300]
What an accomplishment.

[00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:31.400]
Well, I'm running down here, I can say.

[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.900]
Listen, you're going to blow everybody off the map on FM.

[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:38.300]
And also the bird can do the trafficker report from the sky with no overhead expenses.

[00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:40.220]
Yeah, that's very good thinking.

[00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:42.520]
One bad piece of news for you.

[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:44.460]
Who's going to be here to say bring that baby down?

[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.140]
One bad piece of news.

[00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:50.460]
Jamie and Marcie just bought Zeta and the body wrap place.

[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:52.300]
You're in trouble.

[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:54.620]
I'll have a question for Stan.

[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.320]
For Stan.

[00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:56.680]
Yeah.

[00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:59.760]
Is it, but it's amazing that he's up before 12.

[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:02.520]
Oh boy, very rare, sir.

[00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:03.000]
Yeah.

[00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:06.920]
Is it true that only was taken off Stan's show because she got too big for her bridges?

[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:08.020]
Yep, absolutely.

[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:09.440]
Well put.

[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:10.700]
I couldn't put it better, sir.

[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:11.360]
Okay.

[00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:15.760]
One more thing I hear Joey Reynolds is applying his Stan sidekick now.

[00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:17.580]
That's true, bud.

[00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:18.760]
You're going to have to have to have to next week.

[00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:19.160]
Yeah.

[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:20.460]
That by the way is true.

[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.420]
I think we're all over Joey.

[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:22.940]
I'm going to get up at 6.

[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:23.980]
The service is 6.20.

[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:25.560]
So I'm going to be out for work.

[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:26.080]
Okay.

[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:26.620]
Okay.

[00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:27.400]
Have a nice day.

[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:28.000]
I'll read the darch.

[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:28.440]
All right.

[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:34.380]
Harry, you put my eats, Marcie.

[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:35.060]
I'm going bowling.

[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.360]
Oh no, you're not, Jamie.

[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:38.020]
Did you forget what night this is?

[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:39.120]
No way, Marcie.

[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:43.680]
No way is your mother and those two evil step sisters coming over here tonight.

[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:44.640]
No, no.

[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.900]
It's Bill Parmesan night with our idols.

[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:48.900]
Stan Major and Neil Rogers.

[00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:50.100]
Oh, no, you know.

[00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:55.620]
I am not sitting here while Stan majors undresses you with his lear and ingeerin and that

[00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:57.560]
Neil Rogers eats a set of house in home.

[00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:00.280]
Jamie, I mean so much to me and my sister.

[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:00.840]
All right.

[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:01.340]
All right.

[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:02.080]
Just this once.

[00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:04.520]
Hey, what happened to my bowling money?

[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:05.500]
Oh, oh, that.

[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:07.620]
Well, I forgot to tell you.

[00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:11.280]
The only way I can get them to come over was to bribe their agent, the bird.

[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:12.500]
What, with Diamond?

[00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:13.220]
Not yet.

[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:16.260]
Just the lovely rogue team with his name engraved on it.

[00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:23.960]
Will Stan and Neil really eaginner over the evil home of Marcie and Jamie?

[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:30.400]
The last known personality to eat there was Lee Fowler and he was never heard from again.

[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:32.300]
They're here.

[00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:35.900]
And baby, you're the greatest.

[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.960]
Get my regards to Neil Rogers.

[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:43.180]
Tell him that I've never heard of smuddy or program in my life.

[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.160]
Okay, 10 before 11 at W.I. and Z.

[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:46.180]
We'll come right back.

[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:46.800]
Hey, Anne.

[00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:48.100]
Same John raise.

[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:49.320]
The movie people would say.

[00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:50.560]
Or are we back?

[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:51.280]
John.

[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:51.860]
John.

[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:52.220]
John.

[00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:53.780]
Finally finished that cinnamon roll.

[00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:54.680]
How long did that take?

[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:55.500]
About a half.

[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:56.560]
That's a half hour cinnamon.

[00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:57.020]
Yeah.

[00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.000]
Oh, breakfast.

[00:38:58.960 --> 00:38:59.360]
God.

[00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:01.300]
When is he going to stop with the food?

[00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:01.620]
Today.

[00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:03.680]
Are they going to be sending those in every morning?

[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:04.760]
No.

[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:05.440]
Six o'clock.

[00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:06.020]
Okay.

[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:06.340]
Now listen.

[00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:08.240]
What we might do, what happened to fix it?

[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:12.280]
We might get along my cord and go to the computer and go to the computer.

[00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:13.280]
I don't think so.

[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:15.180]
Now we're having too good of a time in here today.

[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:16.720]
We don't care about that book anyway.

[00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:17.660]
We don't.

[00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:18.820]
I do.

[00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:19.420]
I'll do you.

[00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:21.000]
Yeah, I have five grandriding on it.

[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:21.560]
How about you?

[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:22.480]

[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.020]
You didn't tell me that.

[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:24.560]
Oh, okay.

[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:25.400]
So do I.

[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:26.300]
Yeah.

[00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:29.620]
Of course, I've already got it made so it's no sweat.

[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:30.060]
That's right.

[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:30.540]
That's what I did.

[00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:32.220]
And I'm taking it all up to pomp it out of the night.

[00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:32.900]
That's it.

[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.140]
Plunging my brains out.

[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:36.060]
There you go.

[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:36.920]
You bet.

[00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:39.700]
I'm going to take courses that can't get arrested.

[00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:41.000]
Knock them down to one to nine.

[00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:42.940]
Just a bird, you're just going to take a trip.

[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:43.300]
Sure.

[00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:44.400]
Oh, yeah, he's big on sports.

[00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:45.540]
Oh, no, no.

[00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:46.660]
It's not sports.

[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:48.060]
It's not the track gambling.

[00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:48.960]
What a track gambling.

[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:51.340]
Yeah, it's like relaxing.

[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:52.680]
It stands a big gambler.

[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:53.340]
Mm-hmm.

[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:53.880]
Oh, yeah.

[00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:54.300]
All right.

[00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:58.140]
I couldn't get him to go to the track for lover money.

[00:39:58.340 --> 00:39:59.660]
I went to Calder one time.

[00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:00.240]
You weren't there.

[00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:00.720]
Yeah.

[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:01.860]
He went there to look around.

[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:02.540]
We look around, yeah.

[00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:03.400]
Had lunch and left.

[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:03.820]
Yeah.

[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.240]
The powers were screaming at him.

[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:05.600]
I want to bet.

[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:06.420]
No, just looking.

[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:07.160]
Just looking.

[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:11.440]
He's the only guy who goes to the track and the supermarket and says, I'm just looking.

[00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:15.940]
I understand from some of my goombas and filly that stand as a few markers still there at

[00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:16.940]
the brandy one.

[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:19.120]
He still has a few markers.

[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.020]
You're Larry King, Larry King markers.

[00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:24.220]
Yeah, Larry was there last night.

[00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:24.940]
I was on.

[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:26.620]
I should check.

[00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:27.900]
I should check.

[00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:33.000]
But then soon to be getting any takers on it.

[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.920]
Does Jay know about the Larry King bumper strip?

[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:38.520]
Yeah, Honkiv, Larry King owes you money.

[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.140]
Frank Motek is back in the back.

[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:42.640]
I don't know.

[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:44.600]
I'll tell you a second.

[00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:47.420]
You know, Frank, for his second, gigantic, disgusting.

[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:53.980]
This wasn't publicly announced yet to the station, but Frank is officially the comp-troller of

[00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:55.080]
W-I-N-Z.

[00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:55.540]
It's true.

[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:57.000]
He trolls for coming.

[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.000]
What do you mean you're going to take both of those?

[00:40:59.180 --> 00:40:59.720]
What does that mean?

[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:05.080]
Well, there are a couple people out there that are afraid to walk in the room and have requested

[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:05.760]
that.

[00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:08.000]
But see, they send you the picture.

[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:09.160]
They're just trying to throw it.

[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:10.720]
They're comms, they're freebies.

[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:11.480]
They want their-

[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:13.620]
Tell Gary and Mark we would never tell anybody about it.

[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:13.880]
Okay.

[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:14.960]
Come to relax.

[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.360]
Well, they got hungry.

[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:17.740]
They really be.

[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:20.200]
It's not much to know who's afraid to come in here.

[00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:20.560]
Yeah.

[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:22.520]
Who's afraid of the big bad guy?

[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:24.080]
You can't have the rolls unless you tell us who's afraid.

[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:25.320]
That's our food.

[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:26.100]
Fins up.

[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:26.800]
Who's chicken?

[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:27.060]
Okay.

[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:29.620]
You're new boss.

[00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:32.020]
Peter Buzzer.

[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:32.140]

[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:36.580]
He was the other day when the guy's brought the pizza in and he was in here and he said,

[00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:37.260]
where's the food?

[00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:38.500]
And I said, it'll be here in five minutes.

[00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:39.820]
And I said, okay.

[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.520]
And I paged him and I rang his office and he just-

[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:43.060]
What are you saying?

[00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:44.040]
He's the very low-profile.

[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:44.320]
Yeah.

[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:45.000]
Very low.

[00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:47.400]
Yeah, look out for those sneaky eaters, boy.

[00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:48.240]
Okay, that's one.

[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:50.540]
Who else?

[00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:51.500]
Who might be the other one be?

[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:55.740]
And Joanne would not come in.

[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:56.560]
Really?

[00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:57.220]
Yeah.

[00:41:58.540 --> 00:41:59.060]
Wouldn't come in.

[00:41:59.120 --> 00:41:59.920]
We like Joanne.

[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:00.520]
That's because I'm in here.

[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:01.160]
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:02.080]
Don't go too far.

[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:02.480]
She's busy.

[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:03.260]
You know, what is this?

[00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:05.260]
We like, you know, he speaks for everyone.

[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:06.000]
We like Joanne.

[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:06.920]
Well, now you're getting to know him.

[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:08.020]
I've had to put up with that crap for a month.

[00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:09.180]
I feel sorry for you, man.

[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:10.120]
We like Joanne.

[00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:11.340]
Let's take a poll.

[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:12.080]
You don't like her.

[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:13.880]
No, she's all right.

[00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:15.220]
I mean, she's nice.

[00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:18.060]
But I mean, you know, like is pretty strong.

[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:19.540]
I mean, no, like is-

[00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:21.780]
I mean, that's getting into a serious thing.

[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:24.740]
All right, the long Joanne takes a lot of the-

[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:25.720]
The blue hair.

[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:25.960]
She does.

[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:27.240]
She does.

[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:28.020]
She really does.

[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:29.340]
That's why we-

[00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:30.520]
That's why she's afraid to come in here.

[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:31.300]
It's great.

[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:35.260]
She's already had them on me, and I haven't even been on the area, which is great.

[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:35.860]
Oh, yeah.

[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:40.520]
By the way, all you old prunes out there, we want you to call Jay Michaels and tell them exactly

[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:41.660]
what you want to hear, okay?

[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:45.100]
Don't put up with any of this, Bill, for any of this hopelessness.

[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:49.080]
We want, you know, the heavy subjects, the notch, social security, Medicare,

[00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:53.600]
why don't you Christian do a remote at the diplomat, do they float?

[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:54.900]
Do they sink or do they float?

[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:58.420]
In fact, Monday, that's going to be Jay Chris Chow.

[00:42:58.600 --> 00:42:59.580]
He's going to have Dr. Ruth-

[00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:03.260]
Ruth Year Long is going to be here asking do they sink or do they float?

[00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:04.700]
Like-

[00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:07.940]
Or as they say, it's Jay to sink or swim.

[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:10.840]
Mike, don't give your kid ice cream before he goes to bed.

[00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:11.960]
He gets to eye-ream.

[00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:14.640]
Is they say on Jay to sink or swim?

[00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:16.940]
Oh my god, he's coming.

[00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:17.720]
Getting in here.

[00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:20.920]
Oh, here are those numbers, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:25.280]
Here it is, the new picture, the Zeta breakfast call of the Zeta is-

[00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:29.860]
Oh, that's great, that's a classic.

[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:32.280]
By the way, I just noticed an article in Showtime.

[00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:38.540]
They are having a celebration of the orange bowl for all of the former Zeta morning people.

[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:41.820]
And events so big that they used the orange bowl.

[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:45.220]
I got a call from a former member of the morning zoo today who's in town.

[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:46.420]
Oh, really?

[00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:47.140]
There's a little reunion.

[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:48.600]
One of those radio drifters, huh?

[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:49.520]
Boy.

[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:51.700]
What was that guy that used to call you all the time?

[00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:54.240]
It was down from New York or someplace.

[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:55.420]
Johnny Dark.

[00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:56.820]
Oh.

[00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:58.900]
Yeah, they could have a Johnny Dark convention.

[00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:00.640]
Don't look at me looking at him.

[00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:02.320]
It's another one of his old friends.

[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.500]
I thought that was Johnny Rabbit, that was my friend.

[00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:06.260]
One of those Johnny Dullin.

[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:08.420]
Johnny Dullin used to walk around here making noises.

[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:09.720]
That was his big claim.

[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:10.580]
Johnny Dullin.

[00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:11.600]
It's not going to be a good place for him.

[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:14.220]
It's a good place for him.

[00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:16.720]
Well, listen, if you like the first hour, it's going to get a lot worse.

[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:19.040]
What the hell happened to Mike Wolft?

[00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:20.880]
Oh, the word is out.

[00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:21.680]
They sent Mike.

[00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:26.720]
They gave Mike a couple of days at the same school that they sent Arlene to earlier in the weekend.

[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:28.220]
Remember how she had disappeared?

[00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:28.880]
Yeah.

[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:30.160]
The same...

[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:31.060]
Like, they're from the Winkin.

[00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:31.420]
...Kakling 102.

[00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:31.960]
Yes.

[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:34.640]
And Mike's been taking an intensive course in that.

[00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:38.040]
And speaking of Kakling 102, here's a gentleman who can certainly fill his shoes.

[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:43.560]
Jeff Bray is here with the local and area news headlines.

[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:46.120]
He goes from CBS at the top of the hour.

[00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:49.720]
And we're going to come back dozens of us at 11.06.

[00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:55.560]
The Neil Rogers Show continues on WINZ.

[00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:02.220]
If you'd like to participate on today's program, you can call Neil on 624-9400-INDAID.

[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:05.020]
Or 524-9400-INBROWARD.

[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:07.340]
And now, here again, Neil Rogers.

[00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:08.560]
Well, it would let us down.

[00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:08.900]
Would they?

[00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:09.580]
Look at that.

[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:10.800]
Prediction.

[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:13.500]
Neil Rogers FM ratings will be low.

[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:15.580]
AM ratings will soar.

[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:18.760]
Rogers will never rate over sunny Fox.

[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:20.920]
Stand major will soon get the date.

[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:21.400]
Gate.

[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:21.960]
Gate.

[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:24.200]
Signed.

[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:24.780]
Dickey Main.

[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.120]
Who is a full sister to Mickey Day, excellent.

[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:31.480]
Okay, we didn't want to break the news to you, but Jay is not really doing midday.

[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:32.600]
Mickey Day is going to be...

[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:32.980]
That's right.

[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:35.500]
Who's with a B?

[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:36.660]
Who's with a B?

[00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:53.220]
Who's with a B?

[00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:57.540]
Who's with a B?

[00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:57.540]

[00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:57.540]

[00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:57.540]

[00:45:57.620 --> 00:45:57.620]

[00:45:57.620 --> 00:45:57.620]

[00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:57.780]

[00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:57.780]

[00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:57.780]

[00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:57.780]

[00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:57.780]

[00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:57.780]

[00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:57.780]

[00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:57.780]

[00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:57.780]

[00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:57.780]

[00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:57.880]
Who's with a B?

[00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:57.880]

[00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:57.880]

[00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:57.880]

[00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:58.320]
Who's with a B?

[00:45:58.320 --> 00:45:59.640]
Who's with a B?

[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:01.020]
Who's with a B?

[00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:01.020]

[00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:01.100]
Who's with a B?

[00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:06.020]
Who's with a B?

[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:08.680]
I know Tanner can relate to this.

[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:10.980]
A Rikton call yesterday, by the way.

[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:11.880]
You're kidding.

[00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:12.940]
No, Rikton call.

[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:15.140]
I bet you didn't have any celebrities.

[00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:15.820]
Oh, look at this.

[00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:16.780]
It's an old fart.

[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:18.540]
Oh, that's great.

[00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:20.360]
Why ain't it open it up?

[00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:22.260]
No, no, no, you didn't even sit around.

[00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:23.900]
I like that cigar, who we...

[00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:24.640]
No, it's a cup.

[00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:26.960]
Oh, this can be my date of cup.

[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.640]
Thank you so much for the bottom of our hearts.

[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:30.780]
Perfect.

[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:31.900]
That's great.

[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:32.940]
For the mornings.

[00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:33.480]
Yeah.

[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:34.880]
Acadabra.

[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:35.200]
Beautiful.

[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:35.740]
Fantastic.

[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:36.540]
Great.

[00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:38.920]
And I could drink my coffee out of there if I drank coffee.

[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:39.140]
Nice.

[00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:40.460]
But I don't.

[00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:42.500]
I have a little tea.

[00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:44.120]
I have a little tea or...

[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:46.180]
And then I'll spill it into that board of thirty-eighths.

[00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:50.220]
Bring back memory.

[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:52.140]
By the way, I don't want to get Peter Bulger upset,

[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:55.020]
but our first guest on Zeta is going to be Gail Stewart the tea lady.

[00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:03.240]
We're going to be brewing up a wicked storm on Zeta Monday morning.

[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:04.000]
Oh, that's...

[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.520]
Oh, that's exciting.

[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:09.540]
We're just killing a little time, by the way.

[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:10.180]
A little?

[00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:10.640]
Yeah.

[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:13.240]
Because we're waiting for those heavy numbers to come in here.

[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:17.740]
They used to say, that's an added reason why everybody in the business is definitely tuned in now.

[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:21.700]
They know that their own stations are not going to give those numbers when they come off the computer now.

[00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:25.580]
All the management people kind of hover around and grumble and make little sounds today.

[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:26.060]
They're too embarrassed.

[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:27.560]
They're the last ones to find out.

[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:30.620]
Well, Neil, we are overjoyed.

[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:32.100]

[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:20.680]
Oh, in the end.

[00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:23.500]
Much later on, you'll have to investigate that.

[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:26.880]
Oh, it looks like this will supposed to be sent to you

[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:28.460]

[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:28.900]

[00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:29.960]
Oh, it's a tape.

[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:33.200]

[01:03:57.340 --> 01:04:02.180]
They wrap you and all this they cover your body with mong and they wrap you up like a mummy and they take it all off and you look like

This is the Neil Roger show

[01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:24.140]

[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:35.840]

[01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:39.860]
When it queues up again in just four or five minutes here

[01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:45.020]
One of these guys do it. They do like a 10 second bit and they put it on a five and a half minute cart

[01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:49.960]
Why don't they do that? Well, he just wanted to be sure there was plenty of room on the clock

[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:54.040]
Yeah, so we couldn't play it back to back and catch any of those little runaway sounds

[01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:54.720]
That's it

[01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:58.700]
One of these days. I'm telling you it's gonna queue up again. I'm positive

[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:01.960]
That's all our breath. You may want to take a couple of calls

[01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:08.400]
This is the Neil Roger show. Listen carefully

[01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:10.240]
This is your blame

[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:13.200]
Any questions

[01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:17.100]
Hmm you heard that's there. It's there

Six killed by runaway s on turnpike near Disney World, you know

[01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:35.920]
Okay, here comes the usual empty handed ladies and gentlemen and the computer look is down

[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:37.940]
What the hell is he doing back there?

[01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:45.120]
Well, it seems that there are so many people in the area who have gained excess

[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:47.760]
Yeah, that we don't get it

[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:52.840]
At the moment ours has been delayed because some other people are wondering if some hackers

[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:55.980]
Yeah, that's how the system would well be

[01:05:56.560 --> 01:06:02.520]
Kindle area maybe found was maybe down in candle could be yeah, and I'd be delighted to go and during the new news break

You have the phone number down there. We can find out what the hell's going on

[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:09.180]
You know what I'm saying? Yeah, cuz it'll be nice. We would like some of the information too

[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:11.640]
All since we're paying for it. Although

[01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:14.160]
And he's not

[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:19.100]
But maybe course on the other hand you'll call back and give us the rest of the number of sure when he has them

I'm sure you will you think he will have a bad line he has a bad line. Oh, sure

[01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:26.540]
All right, rarely do we invite that particular individual to call in

[01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:31.200]
But because we're desperate and because everybody else's job in the market is hanging on it get with it

[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:31.580]

I met it all you can say it on it

[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:35.840]
I was wondering what is the war going on between you and Joey is this personal because he says he doesn't know you

[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:39.320]
I don't know him either. I just know about him. Oh, you don't know each other. No

[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:42.740]
Okay, well he said he said you read his mortgage over there and and that got him

[01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:49.320]
They got him upset. Yeah, did you do that? I read parts of it. Yeah, somebody brought it in here one of his good friends from CalFed

[01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:55.060]
They brought it in here. That's ridiculous. Of course it is now who's gonna be taking your place on

[01:07:55.060 --> 01:08:00.080]
Am jay michael's he's sitting right here. Hi, Mary Beth. Hi nice to meet you. Nice meeting you

[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:02.900]
Um, are you gonna still do Saturdays? Who?

[01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:12.480]
Okay, well, I still like to listen to both okay

[01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:17.940]
Also, do you know how do they calculate these ratings? I was just curious. How do they find out?

[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:20.640]
I know I take them so long the invite psychics in

[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:26.020]
And everyone what do you mean we can't talk about that? What does that mean calculating the ratings?

[01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:28.820]
So have you ever seen the lottery machines? Mary Beth? Yeah

[01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:30.500]
Like the bingo machines

[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:37.100]
Look, they take they take every radio station they write their name on one of the balls and

[01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:42.000]
No, no seriously they have a they have a they have a machine with all the radio stations written on a balls

[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:49.700]
And then then another machine with all the different personalities in the market and then they have a third machine with different numbers in them and then they have a special machine with

[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:52.420]
That's a whole

[01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:52.820]
Remember

[01:08:54.060 --> 01:09:00.860]
So they go to the first machine they pull out a number okay stand major and then they go to the next okay

[01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:03.220]
And then they go whatever

[01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:07.160]
Oh, no, that's not fair. That's how they do it. I

[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:08.300]
I'm just I'm so curious

[01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:17.480]
Now and for this Mary Beth the radio stations pay millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars every year

[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:19.780]
Because Joey was telling everyone to tune in there

[01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:22.720]
Why are you listening to him? He's not an authority

[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.720]
Well, that just got me curious. Yeah, yeah, you know, do you like joy?

[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:33.500]
Very best. Hold it very nice. Don't you understand there's a one-way conversation very bad

[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:36.140]
Yes, the stand major do you like Joey Reynolds?

[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:40.260]
Uh, well, yeah, I did like him at first because I used to listen to Howard Stern

[01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:45.260]
I thought he was just great when I was in New York and what did you like about Howard Stern?

[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:49.820]
Well, he's kind of a David Letterman type and I don't know he's in a way

[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:52.640]
He's kind of rude, but he says things like they are and like he thinks they are

[01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:59.280]
He's very open-minded and I just think I think he's filthy myself. I think he's hysterical

[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:04.560]
Disgusting. Yeah, and that's what I'm doing. He's doing a little out of hand lately especially with this war going on

[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:07.900]
He's getting a little rude and I think it's a little too much. Well, we're tired of that

[01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:10.300]
Hi, hi, is it an inch?

Okay, another request for Jeff Stryker's home number there, but

[01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:47.300]
Hey, I realized that the blue hairs are not gonna be able to they don't have FM

[01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:51.380]
The hell they don't know they don't have FM. They were the first ones to have it

[01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:56.720]
You know, you don't even know where you are. You like to hear Reynolds. This market has the number one FM penetration if I can use it

[01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:03.160]
For the good time for the good time for the great to rate to rate to rate to rate to rate to rate to get

[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:07.320]
Time for the great to rate to good time for the good time for the great

[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:13.320]
about as great as now for the next hour is great to rate so get ready for it if you're not prepared

[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:17.360]
Yeah, that little real reef that was sent over yesterday

[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:22.880]
I think we need to send that back. Yeah, we ought to get Elvis to call and say return to sender

[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:29.480]
That's it. I'll tell you because Steve if you're listening things are not good is somebody I know he is listening

[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:31.320]
You know he's not gonna work today Steve

[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:35.580]
But you know, Steve will do his whole routine about wow ratings are an important and I don't you know

[01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:39.940]
I'm not interested in ratings and I go home with a good conscience. Yeah, I wonder if that's true on payday

[01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:45.840]
I think I got a good conscience on the payday. I wonder I mean a two-nine in the afternoon for that kind of money

[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:47.180]
Oh, you know what I'm saying

[01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:51.660]
And of course this makes Mike Anthony and Bob Rich look real good at iod

[01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:55.480]
They're the real happy was okay then yeah

[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.560]
Veritable geniuses handed that big checkover boy and Stan got a what

[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:01.800]
Stan

[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:05.260]
Because like there's an echo

[01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:10.920]
The good time for that good time for that great okay, just try to control yourself

[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:14.040]
Stan got a four-one in afternoon drive

[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:18.480]
Excellent very good like very Alice Rantel had a three-two and

[01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:21.980]
And Steve pardon me for being a shill and a douchebag

[01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:25.240]
Steve had a two-nine

[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:31.360]
Two-nine so he's number number is that number three in the afternoon and number three. Yeah, okay

[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:36.120]
Number three of three he can be replaced by the way because he had the full month of June to you know

[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:38.220]
Set the state this July august September

[01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:43.540]
So we had that month this start which he had a disaster by the way, but and then of course said July august September

[01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:48.140]
And he doesn't seem to be making much headway he can be replaced by Tom Lycus sending time

[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:50.320]
Oh

[01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:58.220]
His buddy so you don't you don't know when things are good say you don't know what things are well enough

[01:14:58.220 --> 01:15:01.560]
You just got a screw around and screw around. It's always been the story of your life

[01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:06.040]
Don't start bringing to people like Lycus back. We've already got this Ray Charles guy

[01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:11.520]
Who obviously hit a big number well? I don't know because let's see we had a seven five in midday

[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:15.000]
Even though there were all these predictions. We were just dying on the vine. It's all over

[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.180]
We somehow yeah, it's all over no material

[01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:20.560]
It's just a passing phase and here we are with a seven to five

[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:24.040]
Number two in the entire market again beaten only by lifeless

[01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:30.720]
With an eight one and nobody can beat them you know, they're on an every office. They got a captive audience and all the doctors and dentists

[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:35.680]
Force listening and the elevator brought on the elevator. They're in every elevator and they'll want an it's to listen

[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:38.320]
You imagine the length of listenership they get when you're trapped in an elevator

[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:46.800]
I mean talk about a captive audience better stand that Charles was gonna have Ray Charles on his is

[01:15:47.180 --> 01:15:51.140]
Today singing it's crying time again. Yeah more hit the road jack

[01:15:57.900 --> 01:16:01.160]
We understand and make in Jeff is a hell of a job in making

[01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:07.660]
Well, they can surf up there. Can't even so as soon as you know as soon as we get the numbers with the station

[01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:10.920]
That'll be good because this page is got like just numbers which is good

[01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:13.000]
We can go with traders over here

[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:16.320]
Yeah

[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:20.420]
And then we'll have a pretty good idea what the hell's going on but we did very well

[01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:23.420]
W I N Z had a five as all he said

[01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:26.040]
Yeah, as obvious that already had a lot of other numbers wrong

[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:30.560]
He did and that tightest for third in the market life of court lifeless was number one

[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:34.240]
But only with a seven this time they seem to be slipping a little bit some of those people are dying off

[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:41.420]
QBA was second with the six five and there's W I N Z tied with some FM for third with a five

[01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:46.120]
And if he ever brings me the other sheet. Oh, it's powerless. Yeah, that's right. It's what I've he said they had a prize

[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:48.580]
And a 10 in the morning at a four nine

[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:49.540]
number

[01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:54.240]
Number four, but I guess they beat sunny. Mm-hmm. I don't have that on the sheet yet

[01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:58.320]
And we'll go through the whole thing because we know there are a lot of very desperate people in the business who are listening

[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:03.160]
The rest of the audience couldn't give a damn last but what do we care? We're gone here, right? We don't care

[01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:04.740]
Thanks see that Stan

[01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:07.140]
Isn't that a great yeah blame me now, okay?

[01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:11.920]
Blame me. I'm leaving you with this gigantic chapter audience. You're sitting here with a seven to five

[01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:15.500]
Thank you. Yeah, the second high-up number that in the history of mankind

[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:20.680]
And that was during the summer book and of course if it wouldn't have been for Olly North

[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:24.600]
That probably could be like a five or a nine again, right? You might have been you might have beat life

[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:29.820]
Yeah, that's true. Olly was here. That's right. Yeah, Olly was here for a solid weekend. Of course. They didn't help you either

[01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:34.260]
In a month of what was at July? Yep July. Yeah a death knell

[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:40.440]
You're on vacation. Yes for part of that and then there were certain other shows when I was on vacation

[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:43.460]
There were real decade, but we don't want to talk about that right? Yep

[01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:44.940]
Yeah, okay excellent

[01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:47.300]
So if there's anybody in the business we have some open lines in date

[01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:51.400]
Where some of the program directors hung up during the news break after they heard these numbers six two four

[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:57.060]
six two four nine four hundred probably on long distance with those consultants right now

[01:17:57.060 --> 01:17:59.380]
What do we do now? What do we do now smart ass?

[01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:00.660]
I didn't work didn't work

[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:06.760]
Can you see the the phone lines to the consultants over your move that must have been the closed doors

[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:09.780]
They were on the phone to New York and probably Iowa

[01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:12.060]
You know the cornfield and Iowa man

[01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:12.600]
All right

[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:16.640]
I can't have programmed this one now. Yeah, what do we do now? Davenport I play more music

[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:20.780]
You're gonna hear more music on FM in the morning. Oh here come a joy now. She's got those heavy

Heavy sheets here. All right. Thank you, Joanne

[01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:26.600]
We like these even have colliders on us good

[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:32.320]
Uh-huh. Now what do you want to know boy? I feel like I've got such power now as Tanner would say

[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:37.420]
I like know what W.S. News got a W.S. News against you against me

[01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:41.160]
Well, let's see 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. I had a 7.5 they had a 2.7

Where's Sandy? Yeah, that'll turn it around

[01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:52.380]
Now when did she go back on the air?

[01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:56.800]
Like first of September I think well this includes the entire month of September

[01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:59.840]
So if they made a big comeback it doesn't show here

[01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:04.580]
And then in the afternoon Al was tied for 13th with a 3.2 share

[01:19:05.260 --> 01:19:09.000]
What can I say other than to say we're sorry

[01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:11.520]
They've been hard-moving out of the club.

[01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:14.960]

[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:16.960]

Downward trend. Well see that's a Neil Rogers theater that did that

Yeah, they can blame that it's an old man Donald. Yeah, it's a good time for the great taste

Let's see GTR in the morning had a bit of three. Well, I tell you a lot of those fms

[01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:10.580]
Not too hot wouldn't it be fascinating if the GTR had a better summer book than they had

[01:20:10.580 --> 01:20:14.560]
Oh wait a minute ladies and gentlemen. We've made a mistake. We have made an error

[01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:16.740]
Probably in my number. No

[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:24.260]
Now listen I want to talk to the people of exotic gardens when you send those flowers back over to the 79th street

Was not a 2.9 it was a 2.6

[01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:33.620]
Whoo boy that really shattered him

Tied for 17th

[01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:42.780]
With a station in Jacksonville

Pete by West Palm Beach he was tied with WLRN for 17th time thing

[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:51.680]
I can't believe the DeSisto's didn't knock the

What did she do in the morning? What kind of a number did they have uh, when did Joey come in here?

[01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:54.780]
He's gone

[01:21:55.260 --> 01:22:00.720]
Yeah, and at night Scott who left his indelible marks on our newsroom window had a 1.0

[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:03.600]
Showing his butt to the world again

[01:22:04.180 --> 01:22:08.320]
But that's okay. So how do you like that? How do you like them apples? Yeah

[01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:09.680]
Wow

[01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:16.340]
Let's see if you take leaves to to the morning block and Neil 7. Yeah, so that's a good point

[01:22:16.340 --> 01:22:21.440]
But I can double digits here. We're talking heavy stuff folks. We're talking quality rock and roll

[01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:26.480]
We don't have to say that no we also don't say Zeta link

[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:26.680]
Oh

[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:38.240]
Okay, we have a couple of deadlines open. I don't know what happened

[01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:42.580]
I think a lot of the radio people are probably in emergency closed-door reactions again

[01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:46.700]
624 9400 and we'll come back right after this

[01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:51.120]

[01:28:34.140 --> 01:28:38.620]
He used to be a baritone, but now that's now he looks and sounds like Neil

[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:44.180]
I heard a rumor that Ann Bishop sat on him one day

[01:28:56.500 --> 01:29:03.160]

[01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:30.440]
Lot of dawns heavy stones to sir

[01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:31.760]
How did the other

[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:35.000]
Back that's a little toy wait a minute. That's a little code message to

[01:29:35.460 --> 01:29:37.280]
Marcy and Jamie heavy stones

[01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:43.200]
The next the other real words doing the book by the way GTR chick while I thought I had mentioned that but I'd be delighted

[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:46.460]
More than delighted to go back over their mediocre numbers

[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:54.420]
Oh, let's see she had a two six overall highlighted by a two one in the morning, which is a disastrous number

[01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:59.460]
Uh GTR how the hell did GT are dude? And I say they had a three in the morning

[01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:02.980]
They had a three two and in the morning they had a three oh their worst number was in the morning

[01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:08.860]
So that somewhat diminishes of course, you know, they look at all those young demographics, you know those beanheads

[01:30:08.860 --> 01:30:10.860]
Yeah, wait a little they get the fall book

[01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:15.560]
Yeah, that's for the morning show. Yeah, yeah, they're not they're not exactly tearing them up. Let's put it that way

[01:30:16.460 --> 01:30:21.060]
I did leave out an important number and I OD by the way in addition to making my mistake on Steve's number

[01:30:21.060 --> 01:30:24.820]
You know, which was a two six. Let me say it again. It was a two six

[01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:29.100]
And um, you know, I don't think we quite cut that was that two six

[01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:33.380]
I think I get and in midday bill McQueen of course was promoted heavily as the nice guy

[01:30:33.380 --> 01:30:38.460]
He had a big number yet a two oh two point zero guys to this last I guess as a matter of fact

[01:30:38.980 --> 01:30:40.420]
Lee tied him in the afternoon

[01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:44.100]
Yeah, your number was a two oh in the afternoon and there are a lot more people listening in the afternoon

[01:30:44.660 --> 01:30:48.240]
So McQueen was right down there scraping the barnacles off the bottom of the mong

[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:50.440]
Nice guys finish last you said it

[01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:52.900]

[01:30:58.660 --> 01:31:02.180]
Oh, yeah, I'm coming out against free agency is really ironic

[01:31:02.180 --> 01:31:03.380]
Would you like to be back at?

[01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:06.580]

[01:32:00.620 --> 01:32:04.580]
Okay, I did notice channel six was driving up yesterday and they checked the call letters

[01:32:04.580 --> 01:32:05.940]
They weren't sure they were in the right place

[01:32:07.340 --> 01:32:11.920]
There's a channel six news card driving around out there good luck to you. Davey hello

[01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:34.560]
And I'm really glad I hope they get somebody that is halfway civil to people because I think that's

[01:32:34.580 --> 01:32:39.660]
Your whole program is disgusting. I just turned it on because it's the only station. I go listen to this joint station

[01:32:39.660 --> 01:32:42.360]
You can get on his down. Well, what about this? Are you going to be halfway civil?

Well, they are gonna have a big movement over there in fact there when they get these numbers off their computer

[01:34:28.900 --> 01:34:31.380]
If I were you I wouldn't take a shower for a couple of hours

And if there's anybody in a market who's got a septic tank look out

[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:50.400]

Have you ever seen mount rush more?

[01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:01.160]

You know our last uh, well tomorrow. I guess. Yeah, would you do something on the radio the channel thing can use on the news now

[01:35:11.980 --> 01:35:12.360]
What is it?

[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:16.260]
What would you like us to do?

[01:35:17.220 --> 01:35:19.940]
You just hear a wash good because we wouldn't do it anyway

[01:35:20.900 --> 01:35:22.100]
Okay, here's the weather

[01:35:25.860 --> 01:35:26.520]

Volka hello

[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:31.180]
Hello

[01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:36.100]
Okay, you know who that was anyways probably that Jeff for Lauderdale. Hello

[01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:37.980]
Good

[01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:41.620]
Are you going to broadcast in FM?

[01:35:41.620 --> 01:35:41.980]
Yes

[01:35:44.660 --> 01:35:46.860]
Excellent question. That's it. We're thinking about it. Yeah

[01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:52.680]
That means if you do it in the stereo the bird is gonna be on the right side and you on the left side

[01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:58.360]
Well, let me say it again lead you let's gonna be on the right side. I'm gonna be on the left side the bird will be in the middle

[01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:03.080]
Well, I won the bird on the right side so when I do my stereo and I can get rid of my right speaker

[01:36:03.540 --> 01:36:07.760]
Hey, that's a good idea. Yeah, that is they could kill the speaker never thought about it. Yeah

[01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:10.240]
Well, well, well, when it's Monday morning which speaker he'll be on

[01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:18.360]
Okay, I do not have to bird know the difference between a young prostitute and an old prostitute

[01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:19.420]
No

[01:36:20.180 --> 01:36:25.660]
Young prostitute uses butterling and the old prostitute uses polygrap have a good day

[01:36:25.660 --> 01:36:29.900]
Oh boy

[01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:37.160]
26-1 at WIs. What is that beeping sound I hear another people at Channel 10 being called back and I guess is

[01:36:37.860 --> 01:36:40.020]
Left her roadmap at the Channel 10 building

[01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:42.140]
Let's take a little break

[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:50.360]
And we'll come back right after this 23 before one at Wynz

[01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:57.860]
All our favorites from Channel 10 are here the whole crowd and we have a call here

[01:36:57.860 --> 01:37:00.280]
Believe it or not from Lauderdale by the sea hello

[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:06.080]
Thank you Neil very much. I would be interested in knowing is there any other market out of this area that is doing talk at them

[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:07.240]
Windixi

[01:37:09.980 --> 01:37:14.880]
Ophiocere WDB former home of Stan major on other words, you're not the first home of Dominic Quinn

[01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:20.960]
Bob Grant jury Williams and a lot of other radio misfits on other words there is another market other than yours doing it

[01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:24.260]
Yeah, are they successful have you checked their numbers to what they're doing?

[01:37:24.260 --> 01:37:25.740]
They've been compared to what you all know

[01:37:25.740 --> 01:37:30.660]
Well, first of all, let me say this to you what we're doing has absolutely no relationship to what they're doing because they have a

[01:37:30.660 --> 01:37:37.600]
geriatric audience and that's the mistake that they're doing is because they're doing old-time talk with some very old talk hosts

[01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:43.680]
And but they've been very successful in that market they beat the AM competitor regularly by a good margin

[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:49.640]
But you're the only one is doing the sort of talk that you're doing all the other talk shows are still geriatric and I would say that

[01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:51.920]
Truth throughout the country. Well, let me let me look at it again

[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:57.160]
Let's see the ratings just came in an hour ago. I've got a 7.5 here in midday and the next two talk

[01:37:57.160 --> 01:38:01.980]
You're down from from your nine last time out. Yeah, but I was gone for three weeks of the summer sir

[01:38:01.980 --> 01:38:07.920]
Okay, that's a good excuse. It was replaced by all ignore. I'm down from the nine like like what do you want?

[01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:13.920]
You do want a 25 sure you sound like the guys at IOD 12 share minimum right? They're happy. They're never happy

[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:17.120]
That's right. Well, I don't think anybody is ever happy in radio

[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:22.960]
You're always seeking to do something else. That's why you're moving yourself. That's right. We're pioneers. We're like Marco Polo of course

[01:38:24.220 --> 01:38:25.020]
Christopher Columbus

[01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:27.880]
Right another program director Christopher Columbus

[01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:33.440]
You say you uh that Sandy did the Italian sailor what while Sandy was only there for a month in all fairness

[01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:34.700]
So she probably brought it down

[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:35.720]
But

[01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:41.400]
Let's see where is it wait till I get that far down on the list sir

[01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:48.380]
WNWS midday. They had a 2.7 pretty grim. That is grim pretty grim 2.7 tied for 15

[01:38:48.380 --> 01:38:53.540]
Well, I think what they got to do is get some of those board offs out of there. Matter of fact, I guess Craig Anderson is no longer with him

[01:38:54.580 --> 01:38:57.400]
No, that's the wrong stations her Craig Anderson's an IOD

[01:38:57.400 --> 01:39:02.280]
Yeah, be a program director sir if you can't get this guy wants to be a PD mixed up. You want to be a PD?

[01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:06.780]
For sure sounds like a station manager. I'm hired. I'm hired. You got it

[01:39:06.780 --> 01:39:11.480]
This is fantastic. Now you'll have some real competition. Let's see where the hell is IOD? Did they make the list?

[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:15.140]
Are they on here somewhere? Wait. Don't lost the last sheet. They fell off the page

[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:21.420]
Oh no wait a minute. Let's see. They had a 2.0 in midday and a 2.6 and at night they had a resounding 3.5 with a baseball

[01:39:21.980 --> 01:39:26.780]
I don't understand they have told you a time and time again that ratings do not count.

[01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:32.040]
They're not the important thing. It's ups and downs. When if you had their numbers you'd keep saying it over and over again too

[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:36.520]
Oh, that's true, but listen man. Maybe there's something other than ratings than radio anyway

[01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:41.200]
Maybe there's something beyond the horizon. There's somebody can seek out rather than trying to get the freaking numbers

[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:46.020]
Yeah, there's there's a word for you. What's called? Failure. Okay, let's go to Hollywood. Hello

[01:39:46.540 --> 01:39:51.240]
Neil. Yeah, first of all congratulations. Thank you. That's your game in my law

[01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:56.680]
I got it. I've got a company car with only AM radio and I never listened to AM until then

[01:39:56.680 --> 01:39:58.820]
And since then I've been addicted to you

[01:39:59.140 --> 01:40:03.520]
And I guess I'm going to have a look for another company car now that you're on FF. Well, let me ask you this question

[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:08.540]
Why would you just get like a I don't know what's helping you to Sony Walkman because that's illegal. You can't do that in the car

[01:40:09.220 --> 01:40:13.880]
But you can get like another radio you could put in the car, right? I'm gonna have to do something because I can't live without

[01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:18.620]
A lot of what do you look so pervading? I've had I've had a problem with this for the past couple of days and a couple of the collars

[01:40:18.620 --> 01:40:23.020]
And you've reiterated this time and time again and you did it again at the track last night and they're still

[01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:26.600]
I can't listen to you because I only have AM in the car

[01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:31.220]
But you're on at a time when they're still home. Yeah, they're getting ready for for yeah

[01:40:31.220 --> 01:40:34.520]
Are you in the car at six o'clock in the morning? I'm calling for my car now

[01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:41.220]
No, wait a minute. What is that every spot? There you go. Sir, listen to me read my lips. Are you in your car at six in the morning? No

[01:40:41.220 --> 01:40:42.560]
I'm not what time to get in the car

[01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:47.200]
Uh seven seven thirty. Okay seven three so in a meantime, it's like it what time to get up

[01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:51.860]
Well, I can listen to you for the first hour hour and a half and then you'll have to go out and buy an FM radio

[01:40:51.860 --> 01:40:55.740]
Yes, so okay. It's not expensive. Go to sound advice anyway

[01:40:56.140 --> 01:40:59.500]
Congratulations, and I will be trying a melting pot. Thanks to you. Okay. Thanks a lot

He didn't want to move to Miami because he didn't want to live in the same town as the Miami right here

All the paper that brought down Gary Hart's campaign by sticking out his Washington DC townhouse. I like Don. Oh, fucks it

[01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:27.960]
Uh, let's see. Here's RBD VCG XDJ with a 0.5 big number

[01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:34.140]

[01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:39.960]
That must be the Neil factory. Yeah, actually I want to say that see part of that was

[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:46.960]
When I was programming over there in the in the change of format I put on just non-stop

[01:43:47.860 --> 01:43:54.100]
Oldies. Oh, yeah, no jokes or anything. So the part of that it's the only reason they got that much for for the summer was because of that

[01:43:54.100 --> 01:44:00.760]
Where the hell is KAT on here? Do they make the list? Yes, 2.4. Oh, boy. They made the productable. Yeah

Yes, and by the way, King did have a 2.6 and I told you and you incorrectly

[01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:08.340]
Well, I'm so sorry. I apologize. Okay. Well, you accept my apology

[01:44:08.340 --> 01:44:13.800]
And don't forget the early bird gets the worm on the computer. Okay

[01:44:28.300 --> 01:44:30.280]
You can savor the flavor of these wonderful numbers

And Lee will be taking this to

And just branding it on his chest look at that the only two in the young history of Zeta

[01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:43.040]
Which reminds me to what 400 people know

[01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:51.540]
Where's possible solely for that two in the afternoon? Where is he? I don't see anywhere there like like Rod Sirling

[01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:54.840]
He does look like Rod Sirling. Where the hell is he?

[01:44:54.840 --> 01:44:55.400]
More and more

[01:44:55.840 --> 01:45:03.340]
You see the smoke the middle very hiding in the distance. Hey listen if I had these numbers I'd be hiding too

[01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:10.360]
But that's gonna change Peter. Yeah, that'll change. We'll get that one. What was it in the morning again?

[01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:14.580]
I don't want to keep rubbing it in one two. We'll get that up to a one four by

[01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:17.860]
By January at the latest. Yeah, we get

[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.840]
Yeah, give us a little time. Would you please don't expect miracles?

[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:28.300]
A little tricky to call from Lake Worth. Hello. Hello Neil. Congratulations. What are you?

[01:45:28.460 --> 01:45:36.680]
Been kidnapped and taken to Lake Worth? No, unfortunately. I was bored here. Oh boy. You were bored there? Yeah, still are. Oh, I don't blame you

[01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:40.780]
I think Mr. Ego over at being the walking dead

[01:45:40.780 --> 01:45:45.500]
Tent on demise over there. What the world intent on demise. Oh, yeah

[01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:55.540]
I think he I think he had the scoop on the ratings because he has had this campaign going for about three weeks. Yeah, it's really helped a lot. I'll sink to the septic tank

[01:45:56.520 --> 01:45:57.960]
I says T that's it

[01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:02.860]
And I have one question does W WNN stand for

[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:09.420]
We're really next to Neil that's it. Okay, just let it check. Okay, that's the Neal factor. Don't forget it all right

[01:46:09.420 --> 01:46:12.700]
Okay, now let's see who's next to us on FM 94.9

[01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:20.740]
93.9 of course, so that's the Donald factor which speaks for speaks for itself and in that new age station that WX DJ is

[01:46:20.740 --> 01:46:21.140]

[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:34.340]
That's good. We'll hold jazz and we go of doing jazz. That's right. I wonder why Zeta isn't as loud as we used to be

[01:46:34.340 --> 01:46:38.940]
I don't want to start I haven't even started loud on the dial. Yeah. Oh, it is very loud on the dial. It is clean

[01:46:38.940 --> 01:46:44.540]

[01:46:44.540 --> 01:46:46.160]
Now, but we get to make it a little louder

[01:50:35.540 --> 01:50:40.280]
Why would somebody do that to my happily married life and I'm locked out of the house?

[01:53:01.500 --> 01:53:04.400]
In the race and you go home with 20 bucks

[01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:08.440]

But if you got a seven or an eight does that mean that you make as the honor of personality who got the ratings

[01:54:33.640 --> 01:54:38.000]
Three or four times more money than the people who got a one or two no

Want you to envision that our Carlson is gonna be here. He's got goose bumps now

The biggest guy in the history of mankind

[02:05:41.140 --> 02:05:47.300]
You like the next night. I know you're the only person can throw this race track over 18,000 plus people

[02:05:47.300 --> 02:05:48.420]
Yeah, hold your breath

[02:05:51.260 --> 02:05:52.480]
Good luck to you

[02:05:54.800 --> 02:05:58.420]
Okay, well, let's have a neo-ranges memorial race first and then I'll think about it

Everybody loves you at the race track. All my friends on valet everybody does well tell Jess. I said hello

[02:06:03.720 --> 02:06:07.800]
When you get ready like should valet when Neil gets you over to the FM will get you those great-for-dead tickets

[02:06:09.100 --> 02:06:13.600]
Tell them I got my valet my parking stick to some more valet, okay? I heard about that

I believe he's friends with everybody Mike is a true degenerate of course

[02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:34.600]
Alan brought him up there at the track and now he's paying the price for it. That's it shameless

[02:06:34.600 --> 02:06:35.420]
shameless

[02:06:35.980 --> 02:06:39.280]
I think the thing about Mike is you can go to highlight the dogs

[02:06:39.280 --> 02:06:42.180]
Poppano all on the same night and he'll be it all all three

[02:06:42.640 --> 02:06:44.400]
I'm in free for it. He's there

[02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:45.500]

[02:06:45.500 --> 02:06:46.120]
Unbelievable

[02:06:46.640 --> 02:06:52.880]
Gambling all of Alan's money away. It's disgusting. Poppano. Hello. Hello. Yes. Neil. Yes. I

[02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:58.080]
Overheard you on the radio last weekend talking that you might need an alarm in your new house

[02:06:58.640 --> 02:07:03.500]
I'd like for you to call us off the air my husband owns a bookler alarm company

[02:07:04.140 --> 02:07:07.660]
Really? Yes. I said I need an alarm in my house. Uh-huh

[02:07:08.240 --> 02:07:12.380]
No, I didn't think so. That must have been the uh Steve Cain show. No

[02:07:12.380 --> 02:07:16.120]
He was waiting for the book to come out. I think she and now they're all alarmed in his house

[02:07:17.320 --> 02:07:22.120]
How come the level like on this is just dropped like out of the sky? How does that happen up there? Do you have any idea?

[02:07:22.540 --> 02:07:26.720]
No, I drop out of the sky like it's in a half. You don't have to worry about that after. That's right

[02:07:28.600 --> 02:07:32.740]
Well, listen, I appreciate the sentiment, but what can I tell you? I don't know

[02:07:34.040 --> 02:07:37.760]
Congratulations on your new move. Thank you. Can we count on you? I suppose

[02:07:38.480 --> 02:07:44.500]
Well, now don't get too. That was kind of a look at us. Who enthused you to the old tentative there. A little uh, look warm

[02:07:44.960 --> 02:07:51.220]
Have to be able to beat out panor in the morning now. I would think so. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Okay. Thanks. Hi. Bye-bye

[02:07:51.640 --> 02:07:58.120]
That's not so sure about her. Yeah, questionable questionable event now that's that guy with another plug for his plumbing company

[02:07:58.120 --> 02:08:00.860]
Yeah, I don't know if I'd want them putting an alarm in it. Mobile

[02:08:03.160 --> 02:08:05.800]
Yes, I'll want a good what a good connection. This is yes

[02:08:05.800 --> 02:08:10.600]
This is Judy. Hi Judy. I can barely hear you. Where are you calling from uh, St. Augustine?

[02:08:13.640 --> 02:08:15.340]
Wow, well, no wonder it sounds like

[02:08:15.960 --> 02:08:20.520]
Yeah, why don't you get back in the car and call on the phone Judy? Is your top down Judy. What?

[02:08:21.580 --> 02:08:24.560]
Can you hear me? Yeah, sounds like you're under the car working on

[02:08:25.600 --> 02:08:28.180]
Oh, I'm in the car. A stone just

[02:08:28.180 --> 02:08:34.300]
Found stuff and smashed my windshield and there's a little air coming in. Oh, boy. Are you serious?

[02:08:36.340 --> 02:08:39.320]
Boy, oh boy. What you know, what's that happens? I don't want to get you deep

[02:08:39.320 --> 02:08:43.800]
I wonder where you're going to get up at 4 p.m. in the morning.

[02:08:44.820 --> 02:08:50.140]
Very simple, Judy. Let me let me give you a look though. I'll set my alarm clock the little beeper will go off

[02:08:50.140 --> 02:08:54.120]
You look at it. I'll get up. I'll jump out of bed just like I do every day now

[02:08:54.120 --> 02:09:00.320]
No, no, no, she said how you got to get up you've been up at 4 p.m. in the morning. Listen, I have a bad up in months

[02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:05.580]
I know how the birds are going to get up. I mean, early birds always get up

[02:09:05.580 --> 02:09:07.260]
Yeah, you really get to the worm

[02:09:09.680 --> 02:09:13.340]
This phone this connection sounds like she's calling for an airplane. Yeah

[02:09:13.900 --> 02:09:17.800]
Are you there? We're here. We're not so sure about you Judy

[02:09:19.120 --> 02:09:21.600]
Well, congratulations again. Thanks again

[02:09:21.600 --> 02:09:24.840]
I just bought this mobile phone last week so I could call you

[02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:29.760]
Well, I would take it back. Tell them to get something. They'll take it back. Tell them to straighten it out

[02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:33.440]
Okay, okay, good. Congratulations. Bye. Bye

[02:09:35.180 --> 02:09:35.540]
I

[02:09:35.540 --> 02:09:38.560]
Let you mention the company. You know, I don't know that call would sound on FM

[02:09:38.560 --> 02:09:43.680]
I had the strangest mobile call either guy the guy it was a connection like that

[02:09:43.680 --> 02:09:48.060]
The guy said wait a minute. Let me put my sunroof back and he put the sunroof back and you could hear him fine

[02:09:48.060 --> 02:09:50.740]
Now that doesn't make any sense again tennis setting on the road right

[02:09:51.660 --> 02:09:56.540]
I'll wait a minute. What did you do in the air coming in though? No outside noise. What did sonny do in the morning again?

[02:09:56.720 --> 02:09:59.280]
He did a 4-2 and 10-2 to 4-4

[02:09:59.280 --> 02:10:03.400]
Hmm close. I think Jenny. I read the wrong number before generally a 4-4 beats a

[02:10:03.440 --> 02:10:05.820]
Yeah, but it's you know close

[02:10:05.820 --> 02:10:12.520]
But sonny. I'm sure has a higher cum or something. He'll say let's see his 186. 8. Yeah, he has a little bit higher cum

[02:10:12.520 --> 02:10:14.980]
But nobody cares about cum. I know. They're sunny

[02:10:14.980 --> 02:10:18.060]
You know the interesting part of it is. Let's see cum

[02:10:19.040 --> 02:10:22.980]
Tanners got 178. 3. What is my cum on here 183? 3

[02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:28.420]
Yeah, almost the same as sonny's yes. He always said that he has bigger ratings than you

[02:10:28.420 --> 02:10:33.040]
Yeah, even though he's in the 4-year this time during any quarter hour. How many people are listening to Sunnibox?

[02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:34.520]

[02:10:55.860 --> 02:10:56.400]
Mobile

I did the tribute to Rick to Rick Shaw the more on society just one more time we do you got it? Can you do that?

[02:11:18.240 --> 02:11:22.080]
I was listening to it on this on radio you heard him turn him radio

[02:11:22.080 --> 02:11:28.080]
Uh, that's the kind of stuff that we strive for

[02:11:28.940 --> 02:11:32.340]
Okay, I feel like he is every party wants to hear the film. Yeah, nice shot

[02:11:32.340 --> 02:11:36.280]
Look all you paint any ass people in the Bahamas and then mobile phones go away. Well you're constantly

[02:11:37.860 --> 02:11:42.580]
I'd like to have at least a couple of people this hour we can understand you know that would be that would be a step in the right direction

[02:11:46.160 --> 02:11:46.480]
Wow

[02:11:56.260 --> 02:11:57.660]

Hey, I think they get to the radio show in the Bahamas. I beg your pardon

[02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:08.120]
Why wouldn't they be able to get say to end of a homie family? No special

[02:12:08.920 --> 02:12:13.520]
Too far. Yeah, that's too far. They don't get any diaries down there. What tell a week care about them

[02:12:14.160 --> 02:12:19.600]
Look, this is a business, you know, remember that jerk that was calling before about maybe there's something beyond the rating

[02:12:19.600 --> 02:12:26.400]
There's this uh, yeah, nebulous uh, you know, he he sounded just like the guy who's gonna come on in about 47 minutes on another station

[02:12:26.880 --> 02:12:33.240]
And start alibying about our ratings be nothing and don't care and I look you don't have a good conscience clear conscience

[02:12:33.240 --> 02:12:38.340]
When I go home at night look at the mirror just want to make a good living for my family. Yeah, right? I think of my paycheck

[02:12:38.340 --> 02:12:43.860]
I eat well. Yeah, yeah, a lot of free meals you bet free movies everything boy

[02:12:43.860 --> 02:12:49.940]
Yes, me and movie critic two on the side. That's what he tells them in the theater. Yeah, I'll talk about it on the

[02:12:49.940 --> 02:12:52.620]
I'm telling you the level on this thing has dropped off the end of the world

[02:12:52.620 --> 02:12:55.960]
I don't know what happened back there, but uh, I'm worried about it. Okay

[02:12:57.140 --> 02:13:00.100]
Trust me. I'm not talking about here. I'm talking about other monitor

[02:13:00.100 --> 02:13:04.220]
Probably when all those engineers were up there before they were patching around with the stuff again

[02:13:04.220 --> 02:13:06.860]
You know, they can as soon as I see Rick Edwards up there

[02:13:06.860 --> 02:13:10.580]
I know I know that the world is crumbling around my feet. Okay

[02:13:11.120 --> 02:13:14.700]
What did you do something? Oh, is that a little better? Well, not really

[02:13:15.100 --> 02:13:19.320]
Okay, 24 past one little piece in quiet everybody's out of here just momentarily

[02:13:19.320 --> 02:13:23.260]
You know, I should thank the audience out there because they've been tremendous and they've been loyal

[02:13:23.660 --> 02:13:27.860]
And they've taken a lot of pain and abuse and derision and they've suffered through all of the

[02:13:27.860 --> 02:13:34.840]
You know, monkey business and Portland main and everything else and it really been great and you know the it's it's fitting that the book should come out today

[02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:35.360]
release the

[02:13:36.220 --> 02:13:38.540]
The number should come out for the summer book

[02:13:40.180 --> 02:13:45.620]
Because this is it on a.m. Or at least tomorrow will be but as far as a week. They show this is it

[02:13:45.620 --> 02:13:47.560]
And in the last of three rating books

[02:13:47.560 --> 02:13:52.200]
We had what a seven a nine and a seven five share in the middle of the day here on a date part

[02:13:52.760 --> 02:13:55.600]
On a radio station that used to be like a dead in the water

[02:13:55.600 --> 02:14:02.900]
D E D okay with incredible demographics and the thousands and thousands of living and breathing people

[02:14:03.480 --> 02:14:09.100]
And amazingly enough not only where we number two and midday of all the stations a m and f m in the whole south Florida market behind

[02:14:09.100 --> 02:14:09.640]
Lifeless

[02:14:10.200 --> 02:14:13.960]
But also in cune. I know I said a moment ago nobody pays any attention to cune

[02:14:13.960 --> 02:14:15.920]
But it is interesting that that's the other number

[02:14:16.520 --> 02:14:19.120]
That everybody loves to talk about well we had a big cune well

[02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:22.320]
We had an almost 200,000 people in our cune you know what I'm saying

[02:14:22.880 --> 02:14:25.780]
Only life be this admit day and we beat

[02:14:26.640 --> 02:14:31.980]
Almost every other morning show. How do you like that in fact life just a minute just relax

[02:14:31.980 --> 02:14:38.520]
I know I know you're very emotional very emotional. I'll trade my cune for my share and agent

[02:14:38.520 --> 02:14:41.540]
I agree with you, but it's nice to have both of them, you know

[02:14:41.540 --> 02:14:44.880]
It's nice to have big cune too because that means you're reaching a tremendous number of people

[02:14:45.820 --> 02:14:48.820]
What is that excellent letter you'll want to read that

[02:14:50.580 --> 02:14:51.460]
Okay, unbelievable

[02:14:53.120 --> 02:14:55.420]
They wanted the bird to have tweety fingers

[02:14:56.180 --> 02:15:01.540]
Isn't it cute boy, but you're gonna just go and play with that now give up Brian in the ice cream shop

[02:15:01.540 --> 02:15:07.540]
The real action is at high school swim meets what a disgusting letter sir absolutely really go ahead last week

[02:15:07.540 --> 02:15:11.320]
My god son aged 17 asked me to come watch him swim at a high school meet in Tampa

[02:15:13.220 --> 02:15:14.100]
Go ahead

[02:15:14.660 --> 02:15:21.800]
My god the visible sweetness is all walking around in tiny tiny swimsuits so many so little time

[02:15:22.840 --> 02:15:25.280]
What a disgusting petarist

[02:15:25.280 --> 02:15:28.860]
I read the last by the way I certainly listen to those Catholic schools

[02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:35.780]
So many so little time by the way as I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted

[02:15:36.460 --> 02:15:43.160]
I'll leave okay wait let's just don't start getting sensitive. Would you please he's oh you don't just do the drop of a horse and

[02:15:43.160 --> 02:15:49.120]
I certainly wish that you'd go to FM radio during the summer when we have frequent lightning and thunderstorms in South Florida

[02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:55.100]
Your transmission is practically wiped out this far north. This is West Palm FM would give us static free reception

[02:15:55.100 --> 02:15:59.880]
Think about it. Hmm Palm Beach County enjoys your radio. Please keep it up. Keep up the good work

[02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:05.460]
Henry and West Palm Beach. Thank you Henry with an original idea. Yeah, yeah

[02:16:05.460 --> 02:16:07.840]
Yeah, what a good idea. We're gonna go call Linda Thark

[02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:13.140]
For what she called oh boy, I'm not gonna turn that down. Yeah

[02:16:13.160 --> 02:16:19.900]
She's right. We heard Joe was working last Saturday night. Maybe she'd like to go get some fun. Linda told me that she wouldn't touch the best party you okay

[02:16:20.960 --> 02:16:21.680]

[02:17:21.340 --> 02:17:23.520]
A lady named Ruben and Donald

[02:17:24.840 --> 02:17:27.420]

Remember the

[02:17:48.520 --> 02:17:53.060]
By the way, talk net went down from a 75 to a 49 is that correct as my memory?

[02:17:53.900 --> 02:17:54.020]
Right

[02:17:54.020 --> 02:17:57.780]
Yeah, but you know, I think it's because the Sally just

[02:17:58.360 --> 02:18:04.780]
After me. Yeah, wait till you see it skyrocket now that she's gone. Oh, you know, I got tired of that broad stick in her glasses in my

[02:18:04.780 --> 02:18:09.660]
I have bigger glasses that Sally just the uptellin

[02:18:09.660 --> 02:18:12.800]
She's the only person in the world. I know puts lipstick on her frames over glass

[02:18:16.440 --> 02:18:19.360]
All right, now let's not start with those TV people again

[02:18:19.360 --> 02:18:23.300]
It's best to rewrite a message from Bob Johnson. Oh boy. I can't wait

[02:18:26.980 --> 02:18:28.540]
Freeze as no

[02:18:29.760 --> 02:18:30.200]
What

[02:18:32.220 --> 02:18:32.660]
Neil

[02:18:36.220 --> 02:18:40.160]
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sir. I'm not ready for that

[02:18:41.660 --> 02:18:45.340]
I'm in too much of a euphoric mood at the moment. I can't bring myself to that level

[02:18:49.360 --> 02:18:49.720]
You know

[02:18:51.540 --> 02:18:55.680]
Actually, they don't know you but Monday morning we're gonna lock ourselves in and play this for three hours

[02:18:58.400 --> 02:19:02.220]
Can you see Peter the window outside? I think you're you're the window

[02:19:03.060 --> 02:19:06.520]
To be locking himself in the executive John. Yeah, look out

[02:19:07.760 --> 02:19:13.480]
27 till two at w.i.nz. We have a caller from magnificent coral springs. Hello. Yes, hello

[02:19:13.480 --> 02:19:19.060]
How are you over there? How are you? A good friend. I'm at work. We listen every day over here in coral springs

[02:19:19.060 --> 02:19:24.980]
Do you really? Yes now a little while ago. I heard Stan mentioned that he had a mobile

[02:19:25.540 --> 02:19:30.220]
Caller that had to open the roof. Oh, yeah. Okay. I could tell you why

[02:19:30.980 --> 02:19:36.620]
Some of the mobile phones have an antenna on the roof then it doesn't matter naturally but correct

[02:19:36.620 --> 02:19:41.080]
There's also portable units where the antenna is mounted on the

[02:19:41.080 --> 02:19:44.340]
Transmitter itself which would be inside the car

[02:19:44.340 --> 02:19:48.340]
Ah, in other words, it depends on where you're being mounted. Exactly. I got it

[02:19:48.340 --> 02:19:52.240]
Feel a roof vehicle. It'll hold the RF inside the car

[02:19:52.240 --> 02:19:55.760]
So in other words you should always open your sunroof before you mount it

[02:19:55.760 --> 02:20:00.060]
Well, if if the antenna is mounted on the outside of the car doesn't matter

[02:20:00.060 --> 02:20:06.300]
But if it's a portable where see some of the units can be carried around you can walk downtown where they take it on a boat

[02:20:06.300 --> 02:20:09.820]
Now those have the antenna mounted on the transmitter. Or if you're going to mountain

[02:20:10.640 --> 02:20:15.300]
So you know on those units you have to make sure there's no steel in between

[02:20:15.880 --> 02:20:20.620]
Now you shouldn't steal if you should buy one you should steal it. Yeah, right

[02:20:20.620 --> 02:20:25.940]
But I just figured I call because I heard you mentioned before you were wondering why the guy had to open the

[02:20:26.720 --> 02:20:28.600]
roof excellent very good

[02:20:28.600 --> 02:20:33.260]
This has been a learning experience. You know, Neil must be real help for those that don't have a sunroof

[02:20:33.260 --> 02:20:39.120]
Oh, yeah, well see if the if you're close enough it'll go through the windows and that would be good enough

[02:20:39.120 --> 02:20:46.080]
But I guess the guy was far away and he didn't have the power to go well a lot of people that listen to to the show that

[02:20:46.080 --> 02:20:48.320]
Neal's found over the years are pretty far away

[02:20:48.320 --> 02:20:50.800]
You have noticed that yeah

[02:20:52.460 --> 02:20:55.220]
Okay, thanks a lot sir you're finished all right

[02:21:00.300 --> 02:21:01.260]
Candle hello

[02:21:01.900 --> 02:21:06.620]
Oh, yes, sir, congratulations. Thank you so much. Oh for you to you end stand

[02:21:06.620 --> 02:21:09.820]
I think stand will do a hell of a job that not that he's doing one now. I mean no

[02:21:09.820 --> 02:21:12.000]
Well, I have to start working a little bit now

[02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:18.060]
Hey, you know that guy from there. I started to try to do our lean. Oh, yeah, his voice wasn't deep enough. I know

[02:21:20.140 --> 02:21:24.700]
And by the way and his butt wasn't big enough. Yeah, you oh, well, no, no

[02:21:24.700 --> 02:21:26.240]
The hemias usually have big butts

[02:21:27.160 --> 02:21:30.280]
Yeah, they do as a matter of fact we're gonna be doing a show on that on Zeta next day

[02:21:30.640 --> 02:21:35.140]
Big butt the hemiens yep, the three bees. Yep, I get up at six every day

[02:21:35.600 --> 02:21:40.220]
And then I wake up around six 15. So I'll be listening to you guys, you know, Monday through Friday

[02:21:40.740 --> 02:21:42.680]
Oh, isn't that marvelous. That's fantastic

[02:21:42.680 --> 02:21:49.300]
Our second caller now who isn't all been out of shape about under you know, I'm just gonna try something this person

[02:21:49.300 --> 02:21:53.260]
I see understands it yeah, six in the morning. You know, it's worth the big hand is in a little hand

[02:21:53.260 --> 02:21:59.740]
It's perfect timing. Yeah, that's the good news the bad news is yes, I don't have an AM. I mean an FM in my car

[02:21:59.740 --> 02:22:02.540]
So I never had to worry about it because I always listen to a while

[02:22:02.540 --> 02:22:07.340]
I got news for you everybody that maybe we can get our friends at sound advice to do like a FM special

[02:22:07.340 --> 02:22:10.380]
You know what I'm saying the old ranger special. Yeah, great

[02:22:10.380 --> 02:22:12.640]
Where is most people bins since?

[02:22:13.020 --> 02:22:20.140]
I thought every radio in the world. I mean even if you go to one of those cheapy stink or renegarde places the radio in a car

[02:22:20.140 --> 02:22:22.140]
Has got an FM on it even it's snappy

[02:22:22.140 --> 02:22:23.100]
Well, let's not

[02:22:24.040 --> 02:22:27.880]
I grab a company car and it just you know comes with a standard stuff

[02:22:27.880 --> 02:22:30.600]

We're not gonna be doing that anymore

[02:27:39.440 --> 02:27:45.180]

[02:28:11.040 --> 02:28:14.160]
I think I'll play a don johnson record I got news for you

[02:28:14.160 --> 02:28:19.540]
We don't play records to fill time so we can eat on this show like no that would then he would call for sure

[02:28:19.540 --> 02:28:21.280]
Oh, you get off him already

[02:28:21.940 --> 02:28:24.620]
I know you haven't got it on him yet, but that's a thing

[02:28:25.720 --> 02:28:29.820]
I would think that after all the action majors had last few days he'd find to get over that

[02:28:29.820 --> 02:28:35.180]
But he just keeps clinging to that you would throw a Linda can't go with us to the restaurant bottle

[02:28:35.180 --> 02:28:40.440]
Linda Thornton she she she goes to the one in Kendall who invited her I did

The lady friend with him there. So I would keep you very safe

[02:29:03.480 --> 02:29:07.940]
She just doesn't want to see me it be seen in public with me because then it would you know create the impression

[02:29:07.940 --> 02:29:12.640]
But other one of these incestuous relationships. Oh like with Tom. Yeah, so we'll bring Linda and Tom

[02:29:12.640 --> 02:29:17.060]
How's that we could make it a business launch? We understand there's a certain morning guy in town

[02:29:17.580 --> 02:29:19.120]
Who hasn't unpacked his bags yet?

[02:29:20.040 --> 02:29:21.400]
Who's very upset with Linda?

[02:29:22.440 --> 02:29:25.840]
Yeah, like he has a picture to write all these big things. Hey look at this

[02:29:26.400 --> 02:29:29.880]

[02:29:30.820 --> 02:29:35.100]
shares a little bit of pizza in here with us. You can have right there. It's kosher. It's got pepperoni and cheese

[02:29:37.480 --> 02:29:39.540]
It's from the circle you ran. There you go

[02:29:41.080 --> 02:29:45.360]
We've got one with fruit on it over there for second. We missed the oh, we missed the cuspy table

[02:29:46.600 --> 02:29:48.500]
Okay, boy everybody's thinking look at this

[02:29:49.200 --> 02:29:53.840]
Okay, the one for Rick is the one on the end of it. The one with little things crawling around on it

[02:29:54.860 --> 02:29:56.160]
Rick take some for your

[02:29:56.640 --> 02:30:01.900]
Engineer I'm going to the audience is just going nuts now. You know, there must be in a feeding frenzy. They are I do this

[02:30:02.580 --> 02:30:07.560]
Can you imagine the phones that light up on the pizza places around when we start doing guaranteed now?

[02:30:07.680 --> 02:30:12.060]
What did you say before about the TJ cinnamon's about the roles that when we mentioned it the other day that they got

[02:30:12.060 --> 02:30:16.560]
It's a business. They were nuts. People were coming in from all over from the Bahamas. Yes

[02:30:17.280 --> 02:30:22.200]
Listen clear and plain to the helicopter on day blame. I'm serious on a roof. Yeah

[02:30:23.380 --> 02:30:29.040]
By the way, just we are having a good time. It's a great show. We had some of those fakers from Zeta. We're up here

[02:30:29.480 --> 02:30:32.120]
Oh, wait a minute. I'm confused. I mean our good friends from the data

[02:30:32.600 --> 02:30:40.240]
We're up here. I'm getting a little identity crisis at this point and Gary of course came in to congratulate us on our 75 and midday in our final AM book

[02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:42.040]
Not bad, huh?

[02:30:44.560 --> 02:30:47.120]
401 despite of all the terrible things you said about him

[02:30:47.120 --> 02:30:47.840]
and

[02:30:49.100 --> 02:30:52.120]
And Gary I got a 15 and average cackles per hour

[02:30:53.040 --> 02:30:57.320]
By the way, Stan has a little package few later. It's got two twinkies in a cigar and

[02:30:58.060 --> 02:30:58.460]
And

[02:31:00.720 --> 02:31:05.900]
But Mr. Millionaire over there, Mr. Riga. I keep looking at that number and I say it's got to be a mistake

[02:31:05.900 --> 02:31:10.120]
Because I know that not that many people are listening to him. They're two who's six

[02:31:10.120 --> 02:31:17.120]
We got to figure that out in terms of dollars as they say in Pittsburgh dollars. How much they pay for isn't my case in that

[02:31:17.120 --> 02:31:19.600]
or listener sort of a per listener. Yeah

[02:31:21.320 --> 02:31:25.520]
Yeah, I don't know how much they pay for each listener boy. What a putrid number

[02:31:26.440 --> 02:31:31.860]
Okay, I think we're gonna take another break now just for the hell of it. This could break during the week during the week on AM

[02:31:31.860 --> 02:31:37.300]
Okay, so for those of you who keep track of these things and keep your own log at home market very special

[02:31:39.120 --> 02:31:41.240]
Yeah, Bob's on the listen line right now. That was Gary

[02:31:42.440 --> 02:31:45.840]
Okay, that got him on a here in the hurry, you know

[02:31:46.480 --> 02:31:50.940]
Well, okay, wait a minute. We have another celebrity caller on 135 and it is

[02:31:51.800 --> 02:31:53.700]
Oh, you're just not gonna tell me okay

[02:31:54.700 --> 02:32:00.500]
It's coming through in a long distance. This could be a big call like could be a grandpa, a Lewis from the Howard Stern show

[02:32:00.500 --> 02:32:08.140]
Oh, so I think we could get grandpa's number from Howard Stern. That would be great. Sure. Why not? Okay. Uh, it says 135. Are you on it?

[02:32:09.620 --> 02:32:11.360]
Okay, here we go. There's a special call

[02:32:12.960 --> 02:32:14.500]
Hello, hello. Yes

[02:32:14.500 --> 02:32:15.460]
This is Tanner

[02:32:15.460 --> 02:32:16.180]
Tanner

[02:32:19.880 --> 02:32:25.380]
Congratulations, Bill. I think that old banana mouth in the back. Thank you Neil. Enjoy it while you can

[02:32:25.380 --> 02:32:30.280]
You're gonna do great and you have somebody should say before you get off to say in radio station

[02:32:30.820 --> 02:32:36.100]
That you've done a number on this market. What do you say that again and you can't say which number but

[02:32:37.120 --> 02:32:41.360]
You've done you have a lot to be proud of and I know you're gonna do well on say because if you do well on this station

[02:32:41.360 --> 02:32:44.880]
How could you not do well on that? Exactly. I'd do at least a nine or a ten on FM

[02:32:45.900 --> 02:32:51.120]
But we're not in competition. I mean you're playing all that ethnic scratch stuff. You know, so we're safe. I probably

[02:32:51.120 --> 02:32:56.400]
I think you're you're about right on that I think probably we tend to lose the least but um, I do think that

[02:32:56.400 --> 02:33:02.060]
It's gonna have a profound effect on mornings and I think it's gonna change the way that people think about talk radio in this market

[02:33:02.060 --> 02:33:03.480]
I would agree with you wholeheartedly

[02:33:03.480 --> 02:33:08.740]
So I wish you a lot of luck and I congratulate you on the job that you've done so far. It's definitely been a president

[02:33:08.740 --> 02:33:10.640]
Hey, Bill, can I ask you a question?

[02:33:11.980 --> 02:33:16.420]
What you know, I'm still gonna be here on the old. A. M. Bill. We don't care

[02:33:16.940 --> 02:33:23.300]
Oh, well, I'll listen to what's his name. Yeah, uh, yeah, uh, what's his name any afternoon? What was his name anyway, Bill?

[02:33:23.380 --> 02:33:27.640]
All right, can can mostly still do some stuff for me from time to time?

[02:33:28.040 --> 02:33:34.440]
Absolutely no price no problem. No price difference. Oh, I see. Oh, okay

[02:33:35.200 --> 02:33:41.060]
We'll cross plug. Yeah, okay. You send the you send the tapes over and I have to put them on the cart label

[02:33:41.060 --> 02:33:43.600]
Not for use on FM. That's what you thought

[02:33:44.840 --> 02:33:45.700]
That's what you think

[02:33:46.880 --> 02:33:51.860]
So you're gonna start Monday morning. We owe money morning six to ten you understand those hours now, Bill. Do I have to explain it?

[02:33:52.440 --> 02:33:57.580]
Yeah, now I'm gonna have to run a tape so I can hear you. Okay. Sounds good to me. I could bring you up on the tune in the control

[02:33:57.580 --> 02:34:00.940]
We've just simulcast or yeah, exactly just throw some of it on here. We don't care

[02:34:01.640 --> 02:34:06.140]
