[00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.020]
Can we, is this something we can see on the ear?

[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.740]
Do it.

[00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:05.820]
Then took a poll.

[00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.940]
Ah, very cute, very cute.

[00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.120]
Just get off the phone now.

[00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.400]
You creep.

[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.940]
Ooh, stealing from Steve now by way of Bob Granada.

[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.760]
That's a joke, too.

[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.920]
Third generation stealing.

[00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:18.640]
Yeah, a joke.

[00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:19.500]
It's a joke.

[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.960]
You said get off my phone, I finished it, you know.

[00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.480]
Don't forget now, get those names and addresses in the mail as we can.

[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.120]
So far, PO Box 2214 Miami 33055, and get those checks in there, too.

[00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.840]
And we're going to only circulate petitions in businesses and in condos and churches and

[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.760]
synagogues or wherever else there are lots of people.

[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.600]
And we're going to get individuals to get involved in this by sending in postcards or

[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.440]
little letters with their name and address just saying, I support so far and free speak.

[00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.420]
Pretty simple, right?

[00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.440]
They can't do that.

[00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.480]
I mean, if you want a petition, we'll be more than happy to send you one.

[00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.000]
But if you're one of those many, the overwhelming majority are not petitions, gatherers, right?

[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.280]
Right.

[00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.160]
Like me, outside of petition, but I'm not going to go out.

[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.560]
Yeah, you're basically a pretty lazy guy.

[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.080]
Absolutely.

[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.320]
Okay, it's 1018 at WINZ.

[00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.160]
I'm the arranger's the indefatigable Ernie Sochino Bialog.

[00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.760]
He's got a five hour review of Shoah from two to seven this afternoon.

[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.540]
So clearance will win the Derby Jose Santos in a desperate drive in a furious final 16th

[00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.980]
of a mile.

[00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.000]
It's crypto clearance.

[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.620]
Trust me.

[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.060]
Why, I wish I were out there at Gulf Stream, but I would get anything to be out there

[00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.320]
with like good friend Jean Stevens.

[00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:30.140]
Oh, yeah.

[00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.360]
He'll be there.

[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.400]
Looking for you.

[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.220]
Thanks again, Geno.

[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.300]
I couldn't have done it without you.

[00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.240]
Could never have gotten a book like that without your help.

[00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.800]
And Sunny Rosenberg, too.

[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.180]
Can you believe that douchebag, Sunny Rosenberg is going to be replying to the channel

[00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.900]
10 editorial?

[00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.120]
Wow.

[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.020]
That moron.

[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.820]
The honorable mayor responding to the editorial about me 630 channel 10 Monday night, according

[00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.580]
to Ron Sacks.

[00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.100]
Ron turns out to be a pretty good guy after all.

[00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.380]

[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.640]
We always thought he was a real pain in the neck.

[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.720]
And I talked to Greg Bidell, who's doing some stuff for 10 and he may do a piece on the

[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.340]
so far thing.

[00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.580]
He said he thought he would.

[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.460]
He thought he could do it.

[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.460]
Well, he better do it.

[00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.440]
And I want to threaten you Greg, but I think he'll do it.

[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.760]
I think you will.

[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.040]
If possible.

[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.580]
Hollywood.

[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.960]
Hello.

[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.720]
How's it going?

[00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:20.280]
Pretty good.

[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.940]
I think you just should simply fry glant.

[00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.400]
Okay.

[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.240]
That is the only answer to it.

[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.280]
Well, we'll get daffy and working on it.

[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.360]
Hey, listen, a whole bunch of friends listening to you for the very first time.

[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.040]
Could you please?

[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.840]
I know it might be patented.

[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.020]
Anything you want, sir.

[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.980]
Anything you want.

[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.720]
What is it?

[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.580]
Oh, there they go.

[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.920]
Well, I tell you, they're quick today, though.

[00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:39.660]
They really are.

[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.980]
They're waking up slowly.

[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.940]
Let me read the memo again from our program, Mangler, Mark Cune dated April 28, 1987.

[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.300]
Kathy West has decided to abandon the Saturday morning program on WINZ.

[00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.040]
Like the word abandon.

[00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.360]
Yeah, it's an interesting choice.

[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.140]
Kathy and I have been working under the agreement that her transition to talk was an experiment

[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.900]
and we'd bang around with it and see how it goes for a few months.

[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.640]
Well, bang around.

[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.880]
Yeah, too much banging.

[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.040]
It's her decision to leave the show.

[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.620]
I commend her for her hard work, a great attitude and her loyalty to the station.

[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.520]
Not to mention becoming one of Neil's favorite targets.

[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.900]
See?

[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.940]
I get blamed for everything.

[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.740]
We wish her well.

[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.440]
Meanwhile, this is one of the most profound statements in the history of memos.

[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.340]
I want you to listen to this.

[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.920]
Meanwhile, Saturday mornings continue on.

[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.200]
Yeah, right.

[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.140]
Is that profound?

[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.300]
Yeah, that's profound.

[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.000]
Like, you folks in the audience don't realize how lucky you are because if Mark hadn't

[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.620]
written that in the memo, we might not even all be here right now.

[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.860]
This Saturday mornings continue on.

[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.240]
Okay, is that profound?

[00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:44.400]
For him it is.

[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.800]
The adventure continues.

[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.860]
Now, listen to this next line from the Dr. Mangle of Talk Radio.

[00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.500]
We will experiment further with some people.

[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.160]
First one out of the shoot this week will be Glen Hill.

[00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.720]
Stay tuned.

[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:57.260]
That's the memo.

[00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.360]
First one out of the shoot.

[00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.560]
Like, he shot you out of a cannon.

[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.360]
Yeah, it's painful.

[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.000]
I thought the first one out of the shoot would be the ten horse and they had derby today.

[00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.240]
Well, I'm telling you this guy, they want the vices.

[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.040]
They've already, they're doing the vices out there.

[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.040]
You'll get it all today folks.

[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.860]
We're playing all the material, the whole rack during this show today.

[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.100]
As our way of saying thank you for being so indifferent to the show last two days.

[00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.900]
It's true.

[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.320]
This happens to me every rating book.

[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.880]
We're not given the numbers on the year anymore.

[00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:25.980]
We won't talk about the ratings.

[00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.960]
In fact, I'll lie.

[00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:28.180]
No.

[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.720]
I'll say, boy, we really did lousy.

[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.100]
We start and then they'll, oh, we're so, don't feel bad.

[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.900]
You know, they will get a lot of calls, sympathy calls.

[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.600]
But every time when a book comes out, we did great this week until Wednesday, till the

[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.800]
book came out, then the minute the book came out, bingo.

[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.020]
It's like, okay, we've beaten up a tenured him, screw him now.

[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.460]
You know, let's go on to something else.

[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.600]
Like Sandy.

[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:51.580]
Hoppano, hello.

[00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.600]
Hello.

[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:53.260]
Yes, sir.

[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.820]
Passies, racer remark.

[00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.260]
Which kind of racer remark was that?

[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.620]
I don't know, sir, but you bore the hell out of me.

[00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.340]
They harbor Rylans, hello.

[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:03.420]
Hi, Bill.

[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.200]
I think Graham has class.

[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.160]
And I think he has a kind of class, but last.

[00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.860]
And I think his last is traming, especially when you get early in the morning and he's

[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.580]
going around trying to get things together.

[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.060]
And I really think he sounds like a very charming guy.

[00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.920]
Well, he's not, but he sounds like.

[00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.900]
Or does that look like it?

[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.280]
I wish you a lot of good luck.

[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.580]
Okay?

[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.580]
Say thank you, ma'am.

[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.420]
I appreciate the call.

[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.240]
He said thank you.

[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.880]
I really do.

[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.340]
All right.

[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.280]
Okay.

[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.820]
Okay.

[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.780]
10.30 right on the stairs.

[00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.300]
10.30 right on the nose.

[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.020]
Glenn's got all these set up calls coming in.

[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.980]
But once we get these out of the way, then the truth comes.

[00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.620]
Yeah, right.

[00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.820]
They're not.

[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:42.920]
You have a couple of open lines.

[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.040]
You have it exactly well in this audience.

[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.480]
We have an open line in day 624-0191.

[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.000]
And one in Broward, 764-0707.

[00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.160]
And speaking of Broward, if there are people in Miramar parents or students, I mean,

[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.780]
it is Saturday.

[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.780]
Although I know that they don't listen to this show.

[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.900]
But along with our survey on Glenn this morning, we want to hear from some of these

[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.680]
who went to Miramar High who got so upset because their principal was insulted on the

[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.700]
air and the school and so on.

[00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.100]
And they apologize because they thought it gave the school a bad image.

[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.520]
How stupid could they be, huh?

[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.900]
That's Jeff Boucher or student at Miramar High said that.

[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.760]
Their school was getting a good image because the kids there had enough guts to stand

[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.640]
up for what they wanted.

[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:23.580]
Isn't that true?

[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.660]
They were getting a good image.

[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.020]
These were a bunch of students who believed in what they wanted.

[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.100]
This is just an...

[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.920]
What is this sound?

[00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:36.560]
Is this the hero?

[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.640]
It's what I had right before me here that I was just reading from.

[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.200]
What are you guys going to get with it, all right?

[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.080]
Glenn's going to do the talk up on this.

[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:47.900]
No.

[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.440]
The step all over, man.

[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.940]
I'm going to be so embarrassing that they're probably wanting back on Gloves 94.

[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.980]
No, I don't think I haven't got any audience anyway.

[00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:57.660]
Trust me.

[00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.460]
Absolutely.

[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.360]
See, I stepped on it yesterday, but I wouldn't do it again.

[00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:02.620]
Perfect.

[00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:03.880]
I hear it once or twice.

[00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:04.240]
I can.

[00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:04.640]
Perfect.

[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.180]
Wasn't that good?

[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:05.660]
Yeah.

[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:06.260]
Big deal.

[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.200]
I feel like I'm on at nights again.

[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.540]
Do a 40-minute screaming wild monologue on the end of the world and something.

[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.860]
Oh, Neil, have you got the chiropractor, is that...

[00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:17.300]
Uh-huh.

[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.280]
Boy, we're really regressing this week.

[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.880]
I'm telling you, things are not going to go so good.

[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.260]
You better talk up this station, folks.

[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.420]
You better run all around with a sandwich board on, because that's the only promotion

[00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.140]
we're ever going to get.

[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.120]
Sorry, man.

[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:29.860]
All right.

[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.080]
Well, I can't believe what Kathy said on the air yesterday.

[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.500]
He kind of just waltzed right by it.

[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.140]
I didn't hear it.

[00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.860]
I really didn't, because I would have dumped it.

[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.260]
Dumbled, did you hear it?

[00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:38.840]
Yeah.

[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.480]
Not, I mean, you did Kyle hear it.

[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.480]
Did you hear his say, SH?

[00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:43.820]
She said it on the air, you know?

[00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:44.860]
Yeah, the loud and clear.

[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:45.480]
Oh, yeah?

[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:46.080]
I didn't hear it.

[00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:48.700]
Kyle is going to write me a message, Doc, because he would have dumped it if he

[00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:49.120]
would have heard it.

[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.300]
Well, where is me?

[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.360]
The next week, what if Wayne doesn't come back?

[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:53.200]
Who are you going to have on?

[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]
Next Saturday morning.

[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:55.300]
Yeah.

[00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:56.000]
Lee Fowler.

[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.360]
Now, I'll come back if they'll let me.

[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.080]
Oh, I see.

[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.940]
Kyle thought she said, SHIFT.

[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:04.300]
I'm tired of taking your shift.

[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.440]
Oh, there could be something really some sexual innuendo in that.

[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:09.220]
How did they take you here?

[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.440]
She was talking to the guy on the mobile phone.

[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:15.680]
She gave.

[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.560]
Anyway, you remember, she gave three reasons why she quit.

[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.320]
A, she was like an airship, the high-sync.

[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:23.540]
Yeah.

[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.200]
A, she's going to go raise her babies.

[00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:28.900]
B, her husband is doing real well.

[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.680]
Where she's got a razor skirt, probably.

[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:31.900]
And she'll start all over again.

[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.680]
And three, she said, Neelan, tired of taking your shift.

[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.740]
That's what she said.

[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:37.840]
Basically.

[00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:39.040]
Well, that's what Kyle thought she said.

[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:39.960]
There's nothing wrong with that.

[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:40.180]
All right.

[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:41.500]
But she left the F out.

[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.820]
That's why we didn't dump it.

[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:43.920]
Oh, boy.

[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.560]
But further we go with this, man.

[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.000]
We better.

[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.140]
So worse it gets.

[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.680]
That's one of the seven worse it gets.

[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:49.840]
Now we got two of the seven.

[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:50.780]
Anybody go for three?

[00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:53.800]
Feel like auctioning again.

[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.580]
I'm sorry, sir.

[00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:56.100]
What were you saying?

[00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.400]
I was going to say Al still playing that dumb old talk

[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.920]
about most listened to Togger radio host on the show.

[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:02.540]
I just want to.

[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.940]
Well, when is the audience going to bombard him with complaints

[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.540]
and say, stop lying already?

[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:07.280]
OK.

[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.240]
I'm going to hang up and call him out.

[00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:08.740]
Thank you.

[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.180]
Good.

[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.380]
What a bunch of liars they are over there, huh?

[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.200]
They may not be number one in listeners,

[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.440]
but they're number one in lies on WS news.

[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.600]
You know how every book comes out?

[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.900]
People find a story somewhere in the book.

[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:21.960]
If you look under the column of lies,

[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.880]
most lies per average quarter hour.

[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.200]
They're number one, but see it doesn't.

[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.480]
It says most listen to talk show host.

[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:32.900]
Yeah, you know, you can say number one because all

[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:33.260]
stay on.

[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.700]
No, no, no, most listen to has to mean either key or average

[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:36.300]
quarter hour.

[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.700]
He's not even close and either one.

[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.880]
See that in the first in arbitrage in anything.

[00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:40.200]
Right.

[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.240]
I wonder where not even close.

[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.760]
See on why 100 they say number one, why 100,

[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.320]
but they're number one someplace, you know, in the book.

[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.980]
But on the show, it's this most listened to,

[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.400]
yeah, which is a blatant, absolute,

[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.160]
labyrinth, absolute lie.

[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:56.960]
That's correct.

[00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:58.960]
It is not true.

[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:00.300]
Shame on you, Alice.

[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.840]
Hang your head in shame.

[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.920]
Like Tom Dooly, 23 before 11 and W I and Z,

[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.740]
we're finding out whether Glenn still has a job.

[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.680]
I'm really kind of surprised because there were a lot

[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.940]
of those ladies who just despised this one of Kathy's

[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.940]
female fans said she didn't say it.

[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:17.900]
I didn't think she said it.

[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:18.420]
Yes, she did.

[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.320]
I think you're hallucinating.

[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.480]
I was right next to her.

[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.220]
She said it.

[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.420]
Let's call Lee Fowler and tell him we've got another guy

[00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:25.860]
hallucinating on the air here, like me and Jika.

[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.140]
I don't think she said it.

[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.900]
I wouldn't kid you about something like this.

[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.000]
I wouldn't trust me.

[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.280]
Easy for you to say 22 before 11 at W I and Z.

[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.080]
And some of you chickens in Miramar,

[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.940]
well, you better call in between now and two.

[00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:43.380]
I'm telling you because you have to in one day they blew it.

[00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:44.400]
Is that incredible behind?

[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:44.880]
Hello?

[00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:45.660]
Hi, Neil.

[00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:46.140]
Yes.

[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:47.000]
How you doing today?

[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:47.820]
Really good.

[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:48.460]
OK.

[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.680]
Just one criticism for Glenn.

[00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:51.120]
Good.

[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.800]
I don't want them to get the same thing that Kathy had.

[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.380]
That's the Pawnee Rubble syndrome and that's giggling

[00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:58.420]
at everything you say.

[00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:58.820]
Yeah.

[00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.360]
I mean, there's no room for another egg-mick man on the air.

[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.940]
But other than that, I think that he was certainly an

[00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:06.900]
improvement of a Kathy.

[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.420]
And I wish him the best of luck, sincerely.

[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:09.400]
How about Kathy?

[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.380]
Do you wish her the best of luck?

[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.760]
Well, what's the difference?

[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.040]
Let me ask you a question about the Derby.

[00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:15.740]
Yeah.

[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.600]
We're having encrypted clearance.

[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:18.060]
Good.

[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:18.660]
OK.

[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.860]
What about William K. Dilly?

[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.160]
No chance on William K. Dilly.

[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.920]
William K. Dilly, counterfeit, counterfeit, counterfeit.

[00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:25.580]
Bogus horse?

[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:26.520]
Bogus.

[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.120]
And I'll tell you another bogus horse is that Gullchie is known

[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.480]
in the trade as a puke.

[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:31.140]
Yeah.

[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.000]
Well, on the word for it.

[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.660]
When he gets to the top of the stretch and he looks down

[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.800]
at long stretch of Churchill Downs, he will puke it out.

[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:39.080]
Question.

[00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:40.280]
Let me ask you a question.

[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.440]
Can you advance that race at Colstree?

[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:43.200]
Sure.

[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:44.460]
What time?

[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.980]
Well, you wouldn't know when they opened it.

[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:47.700]
You wouldn't have been it and then watch it at home?

[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.780]
Yeah, the window's open like at 12.30.

[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:50.360]
Great.

[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:50.740]
Great.

[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:51.580]
I appreciate it.

[00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:52.640]
Well, the best of luck to you guys.

[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:53.340]
Thanks a lot.

[00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:53.760]
Hello.

[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.160]
What do you mean, Alabama?

[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.240]
What does that mean?

[00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:56.580]
Hello?

[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:57.440]
Hey.

[00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:57.980]
Yes.

[00:11:58.460 --> 00:11:58.740]
Yeah.

[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.060]
He's coming in great up here, Neil.

[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:05.760]
I was calling to find out how in the world.

[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:06.600]
Wait, wait a minute, sir.

[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:07.220]
Yes, sir.

[00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:08.180]
Up where?

[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:09.720]
Dozen out there.

[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:10.400]
Where?

[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.400]
Dozen, about 15 miles.

[00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:13.200]
You're dozen?

[00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:15.020]
Dozen.

[00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:16.600]
Yeah, something like that.

[00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:16.900]
Oh.

[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.500]
You got a banjo on your knee, sir?

[00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.620]
Yeah, all of that gets to the drama pick up.

[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.540]
Got riddle slacks.

[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:23.160]
Great.

[00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:24.920]
Got gun in the back of the window.

[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:25.560]
All right.

[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:26.480]
Croom dog.

[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:27.720]
A croom dog?

[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.140]
Yeah, I got my croom dog, too.

[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:29.540]
Great.

[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:34.540]
Oh, I was calling to wonder how in the world did you hear about two-eighth floors?

[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:36.400]
What?

[00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:37.540]
About what?

[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:38.780]
Two-eighth floors?

[00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:39.580]
How did I hear it?

[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.980]
I spent a week in two-egg one time.

[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:41.620]
A week?

[00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:42.060]
Yeah.

[00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.700]
Well, since you started talking about it, I mean, we had a population explosion up here.

[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:46.860]
You know, just like in Highland, Neil.

[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:47.540]
Really?

[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:54.040]
Yeah, I mean, we had about four or five halls, a couple cows, a few horses, and everything.

[00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.780]
We had a couple kids, and my dog got out.

[00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:59.040]
Yeah, while it probably got more sense than most of the people who live up in two-egg.

[00:12:59.300 --> 00:12:59.700]
That's right.

[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:00.260]
That's your tree.

[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:02.240]
That's not too far from Perry, is it?

[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:03.600]
Perry Fordham.

[00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:05.340]
No, Perry, New York.

[00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:06.280]
Gee.

[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:07.680]
Perry, Joe.

[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:08.340]
Here, we on.

[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.520]
It's about 120 miles in my head.

[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:11.060]
Oh, really?

[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:11.660]
Yeah.

[00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:13.240]
We on, all of that.

[00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:14.640]
Can I say that?

[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:15.480]
No.

[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:17.140]
Oh.

[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.020]
Yeah, I'll call the key.

[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:19.860]
Wouldn't read it now.

[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:21.620]
We're really making it now, folks.

[00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:22.180]
She poop.

[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.120]
That's the next, oh boy.

[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:26.160]
I was, you know, I'm not coming, I'm going to call it.

[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:27.880]
I enjoy the last matter fact.

[00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:28.880]
That's, uh, really?

[00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.360]
I, I, I just great.

[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.740]
And, uh, it's a little warm in here, by the way.

[00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:35.600]
I don't want to start complaining, but you're my people.

[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.100]
People love the people of the earth.

[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:39.800]
Okay, we got something coming up for you, sir.

[00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:40.680]
Okay, thank you.

[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:41.420]
Have a great day.

[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.000]
Did he say limperist?

[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:49.000]
Friday nights, there two Miami cops with a hot new beat.

[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.980]
There on the streets, fighting crime.

[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:56.780]
Look, pal, we just don't do strip searches for J-walking.

[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.600]
You can't waste fights.

[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:00.880]
We get a problem.

[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.240]
The loose gang is back in town.

[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.620]
Lieutenant, in that the group of hairdressers

[00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.280]
who attack people on the beach, hold them down,

[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.240]
and then set their hair.

[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:11.760]
Yeah, two back in town.

[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.180]
Let's go get a house.

[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.640]
They don't stop at nothing but clean up the streets.

[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.420]
All the sort of, I'm sorry for skipping them,

[00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:24.000]
I hope you guys don't get on to me.

[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.460]
Just take a seat, pal.

[00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.320]
Glad we're a chair.

[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:28.020]
A chair.

[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.140]
Yes, P-West Vice.

[00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.660]
All right, stop you big pocket.

[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.140]
I beg your pardon.

[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.900]
I am not a first pocket.

[00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:38.720]
Oh, sorry.

[00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.720]
Just one, my giz.

[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:45.080]
There a couple of hit Miami cops on a hot new beat.

[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.300]
In P-West Vice.

[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:50.900]
Friday night's a sign on NBC.

[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:57.000]
There two Miami cops with a hot new beat.

[00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.680]
There on the streets fighting crime.

[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:00.340]
They pop.

[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.100]
That's a handicap face, there.

[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.600]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.720]
In Helen Bay, old Vice.

[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:07.780]
We get a problem.

[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.860]
The grey gang is at the little trace.

[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.220]
Lieutenant, in that the group of senior citizens

[00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:14.320]
who went around trying to get the early bird special

[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.020]
after seven.

[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.200]
Yeah, they're back in town.

[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.320]
Let's go get them.

[00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.860]
They're stopping them to clean up the streets.

[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.540]
Hey, lady, you can't cross.

[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.100]
Here you'll have to cross in the line.

[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.500]
Yeah, they're determined.

[00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:28.340]
They clean up the smuggling business.

[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:30.660]
All right, sister, you're under arrest.

[00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:32.940]
Also, now you're arresting my wife.

[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:33.680]
Watch the charge.

[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:34.920]
Session to powder.

[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:35.980]
I'm gonna at first.

[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:37.240]
Let's see that white stuff.

[00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:39.060]
Yeah, just a thought.

[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.120]
He's got over 100 bags in here.

[00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:41.880]
Oh, what?

[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.040]
Sweet and low.

[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.240]
From that restaurant, you just came out of.

[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:46.500]
Let's take a man.

[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.440]
Yes, there comes a him by any cost.

[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.060]
On a hot new beach in Helen Dale, Vice.

[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:57.240]
Remaining this fall on MBC.

[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.780]
What do you want in the city where the mayor looks like a

[00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:02.720]
figala like Sonny Rosenberg, a screamer.

[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.140]
You're a screamer, Sonny.

[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.120]
OK, let's calm down a little bit.

[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:08.380]
We got the three hours to go.

[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.540]
So far, Glenn's got all his friends and relatives calling

[00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:11.740]
and he's doing very well.

[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:14.080]
I'm surprised the little old ladies who hated Kathy.

[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.360]
They've been quiet.

[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.420]
See, they're happy now so they don't have to say anything.

[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.060]
They're just licking their chops.

[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:21.560]
Is that really a show on couch potatoes?

[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.340]
So stuck in rust.

[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:27.320]
Tunes of major town.

[00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:29.600]
Then my husband does it.

[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.220]
Kiss the cuckoo.

[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.480]
Oh, baby, forward cold.

[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:37.760]
And go out with a most grown man.

[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:39.800]
Don't booze and pee.

[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:41.580]
It's all here.

[00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:42.520]
The headache.

[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.740]
The heartache.

[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:44.840]
The pancake.

[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:50.880]
Rock-a-bye, just use my face.

[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:55.800]
My bare-skinned, roboly-rays.

[00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:00.320]
Tammy Faze, he is the rock that I called out from Monday.

[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:01.600]
Don't you buy my new album?

[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.840]
If you tell me you're burning hair, you're being a wheel.

[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.580]
Thank you, God bless you.

[00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:06.680]
I'm going to go relish it.

[00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.120]
And I have not walked into my house.

[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.420]
I've not seen my puppies and my kittens and all those things.

[00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:12.640]
And I dear friends, that we love so much.

[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.160]
Dance and soul to the people at home.

[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:14.820]
We love you.

[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:16.080]
We wish you and dance.

[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.200]
And we hope all of the people we love so much will forgive us.

[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.360]
And help us to go on.

[00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:29.460]
It's getting to the point now where you can't tell the reader

[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.040]
from the make-believe with, I mean, or I'm saying.

[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.040]
They become like a parody of themselves.

[00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.820]
1107 at WINZ.

[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:39.100]
He'll run into his hair till 2.

[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.320]
And he's going to be along.

[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:44.960]
And it says on the board, he's going to have a headspud

[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.460]
of couch potatoes.

[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.100]
How does he do it?

[00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:50.160]
Boy, a week after week.

[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:54.100]
How does Ernie manage to absolutely mesmerize the audience?

[00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:54.840]
It's incredible.

[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.280]
It's got to be on the phone.

[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:57.060]
Yeah.

[00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:58.340]
He couldn't be here in person.

[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.260]
This guy's coming from the circle you ranch.

[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.900]
These are kosher potatoes, of course.

[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:04.700]
Miami Beach.

[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:05.140]
Good morning.

[00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:05.140]

[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:07.240]
Wait a minute.

[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:09.080]
Was that a fly that just came into the window?

[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.920]
Glenn told me to call after 11.

[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:14.000]
What?

[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:15.440]
I have a lift here.

[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:16.480]
Glenn is great.

[00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:19.440]
He is a talented person.

[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.820]
I can't read his writing here, though.

[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:21.720]
You love his lamp?

[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.020]
No, he's much better.

[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.900]
You want to help a lot better job than Joe Johnson did

[00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:31.400]
on his urgent show on the other station.

[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:32.080]
OK.

[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.940]
That was an unmitigated disaster.

[00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:37.080]
Joe Johnson is a virgin, by the way.

[00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:39.720]
That's what Linda reported in her column.

[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.380]
I have a question.

[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.080]
Did during your celebrity calls last couple of days

[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.480]
did Steve Kane really call you up?

[00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:48.460]
He certainly did.

[00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:49.820]
We had about a 20-minute chat.

[00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:51.660]
Do you want to explore anything with you?

[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.640]
No, he wanted to share some things with us.

[00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:56.660]
Oh, because you were like the explorer thing.

[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:57.400]
We're sure.

[00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.660]
And he was just like, no, seriously.

[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:00.960]
He'd just come back from 10 days

[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.180]
at the Desisto School.

[00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:03.260]
I'm not making that up.

[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:04.780]
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.

[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.860]
And he said it with a straight face.

[00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:09.880]
That he was having his head shrunk up there.

[00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:12.680]
Since you're not in the science of radio for a long time,

[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.040]
I was just curious because I've just

[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.700]
gotten into the AM talk radio listening

[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.360]
for probably last maybe a year and a half.

[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.600]
How often does this shifting around the people

[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:23.000]
occur?

[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:23.880]
Is this like a...

[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.980]
Well, if it's an IOD, it's like every two days.

[00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:31.400]
Because people from Love 94 have gone to television,

[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.260]
people from television have come to radio from FM to AM.

[00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:36.260]
And it's like you got to keep a little card

[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:37.540]
and see what all the players are.

[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:38.020]
Yeah.

[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:40.500]
Now, that's primarily an IOD.

[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:41.840]
They changed the lineup.

[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:43.240]
See, there's so much into sports

[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.580]
that they've got this kind of lineup philosophy.

[00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.080]
And when things don't work, they just erase it.

[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:49.740]
And they put somebody else in a clean-up spot.

[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:52.240]
You know, it's kind of like the locker room mentality

[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.300]
they suffer from over there.

[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.520]
Well, I want to congratulate you on your ratings.

[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:56.160]
Thank you.

[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:58.240]
I'm glad somebody has taken notice of it.

[00:19:58.420 --> 00:19:58.940]
Oh, it's great.

[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.500]
I thought you were in the 11% or, you know, 11,

[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:03.880]
but I wasn't sure what the numbers were.

[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:04.280]
No, no.

[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:05.280]
Sevens and eights.

[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:06.740]
I guess that's real good, too.

[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.900]
Well, in the daytime, it's like a twilight's all.

[00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:09.420]
It's so good.

[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.260]
Nobody believes it.

[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.480]
I had another final question.

[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.540]
How does a smooth, somal cast, when...

[00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:18.260]
You know, I mean, I was wondering how you all do that.

[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.340]
How they play your material at the same time you're doing it.

[00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:23.460]
Is it just like some kind of new technology

[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:24.300]
that we don't know about?

[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:25.980]
Yeah, well, we have this thing.

[00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:28.120]
When you're doing things and then you start playing music

[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.020]
and then also now start doing the same thing.

[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:32.360]
I just think it's been credible technology going on.

[00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.940]
Well, years ago when I lived in Boston, many, many years ago,

[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:41.880]
WBZ in Boston used to have a subcarrier in Springfield, WBGA.

[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.920]
In fact, they used to need a station brake, WBZ,

[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.880]
Boston WBGA Springfield.

[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:47.200]

[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:50.580]
South Miami.

[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:52.880]
Yeah, South Miami, Miami.

[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:54.080]
Fort Lauderdale.

[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:56.600]
I love those Ken Nordene bits that are pieced together

[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:57.640]
in the station brake.

[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.600]
WN, WS, South Miami, Miami.

[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.580]
Fort Lauderdale, Miami Beach, Hodges, Kendall.

[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.940]
I mean, they were recorded like on 15 different weeks

[00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.540]
in different pitches of voice.

[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.020]
One, Ken had...

[00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:12.440]
He had laryngeitis on one of them.

[00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.760]
And it just really sounds good, man.

[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.940]
It sounds almost as good as Al Rantel,

[00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:19.240]
Sound Florida's most listened to, talk to your host.

[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:21.340]
Then just...

[00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:22.640]
You know, they just go on oblivious.

[00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:24.740]
They think they really are insulting the intelligence

[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:25.880]
of all the South Florida.

[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:28.020]
They think everybody out there is a moron

[00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:29.700]
and will believe no matter what they put on the ear.

[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.300]
And of course, there's one about 2% who do.

[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.460]
Hey, Michael's from WWHR.

[00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:38.980]
What we should do is...

[00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:41.220]
Whenever a group of an answers are together,

[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:45.080]
it's have a director, and then only only have one mic on it,

[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:45.580]
one time.

[00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:48.460]
And do like they do in television.

[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.660]
And then Neil can do his Oprah Winfrey.

[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.180]
He can run around with the microphone and say,

[00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:53.940]
what?

[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:04.020]
Goodbye, Neil.

[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:04.860]
Have a great show.

[00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:06.580]
Is that it?

[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.720]
Oh, he hung up on us.

[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:08.100]
God.

[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.160]
Well, I see we boxed him into a corner.

[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.380]
He boxed himself into a corner.

[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:11.680]

[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:11.820]

[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:12.200]
He did.

[00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:13.680]
That's Jay...

[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:15.320]
Jay, what's his name?

[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:16.100]
Jay Michael.

[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:16.960]
I'm only Jay...

[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:17.060]
Jay, what?

[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:17.880]
Whatever.

[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:19.940]
From horror radio.

[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:21.240]
WHR.

[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:22.460]
What call it, or is that?

[00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:23.980]
Big horror on your radio.

[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.600]
1130 at WINZ.

[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:29.940]
We have an open line in Broward where we just...

[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.260]
We're hung up on our high spot.

[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:33.940]
Very big radio personality.

[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:35.140]
Larry Kent.

[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:36.780]
764.

[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:38.460]
0707.

[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:40.040]
764.

[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:41.400]
0707.

[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:42.140]
Miami, hello.

[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.020]
Okay, don't speak to me.

[00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:45.580]
That's okay.

[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:47.740]
Don't bother me at all.

[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:50.900]
Bag.

[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:53.740]
1131 at WINZ.

[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.700]
We have an open line in date now.

[00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:57.560]
A six-hour-like at the prom.

[00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:58.120]
Okay?

[00:22:58.540 --> 00:22:59.860]
In Miramar, Miramar High.

[00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:17.740]

[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:23.640]
HE SON OF A...

[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:39.140]
I wore so sorry, Mr. Sancy Victoria, we think of the old Bag.

[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.660]
We going to get our best behavior.

[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:46.500]
Can we bring some jelly beans to the prom, the president likes jelly beans.

[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.940]
Spreading folks, the soft Florida malaise, it's spreading from

[00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:01.300]
Halendale to Miramar. Next thing it's going to cross the county line into

[00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:05.880]
Carroll City and we're going to be swallowed up in a big cloud of mongol.

[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.920]
Oh, look out, it's coming up the road. We can see it up on 47th Avenue. It's

[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:16.480]
rolling under the turnpike overpass. It's rolling down in front of 207th

[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:20.620]
Drive and here it comes, crawly right up to the street to the WI and Z

[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:24.580]
studio. Hello, hello. Hello, Neil. This is Craig. You don't want

[00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:28.220]
it's like not to have a rating book in your pocket. Listen, I went to

[00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:33.040]
park to my boss there. The gang is kind of radio management and I can't

[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:36.060]
even get a raise. You don't want it's like to go by a McDonald's without a

[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:40.200]
doll in your pocket. On a scale of tensor about a minus four, but not too

[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:43.060]
big. Keep on working on it. I'm working on it. Anyway,

[00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:46.020]
don't be back in a cell. We only do positive on this show. If you want to knock

[00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:50.000]
somebody, call somebody else. I don't knock. Really see the problem is I can't get

[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:57.420]
my voice that high. Yeah. What can I say? I can. Well, listen, I'm enjoying the show

[00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:02.040]
today. It was definitely a lot better than last Saturday. Last Saturday was I was

[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:07.840]
embarrassed for you guys really to point a phrase, but I'm. Oh, wait a minute. We have a

[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.480]
young man. Now, wait a minute. Can you verify this? I have an important message

[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:14.700]
on the screen. Young man said he would donate $100 to so far if we would play

[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:19.240]
Tammy phase record albums spot in the next minute. You'll hold on, won't you? Sure.

[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:22.160]
Of course, you'll hold on. Is that legit? Okay.

[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:26.780]
I'm.

[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:36.000]
Oh, I make. And say a lot of praise for you. Finally, the 10 record set you've been waiting

[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:43.180]
for Tammy phase unbelievable new album. Here's the rock. I called out from under.

[00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:51.100]
I put six to two times of makeup on. Then my husband does it. It's a

[00:25:51.100 --> 00:26:00.420]
song. Oh, baby. Forward. And go. I will. I'm all grown up. I'm losing peace.

[00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:05.520]
It's all here. The headache. The heart. The pancake.

[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:12.240]
Rock of age. Just use my face. My.

[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.520]
I'm a scared.

[00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:20.940]
Tammy phase. He is the rock that I called out from under.

[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.300]
Want you buy my new album? If you're daily, you're burning hay. Oh, you're really

[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:28.660]
real. Thank you. I'll bless you. Okay, sir. I'm sorry about it. No problem. Hey,

[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:33.580]
Reption. It's. It's worthy cause. Listen. Enjoy. I enjoy Glenn. You got to quit laughing

[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:37.860]
so much, though. I mean, you know, I can't help it, sir. The. This man here just.

[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:42.860]
He just a silly person. Yeah. I'm silly person. And that. That is not like Ed McMahon.

[00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:48.240]
My laughter is legit. It's. That's what's frightening. Yeah. Everybody's laughter is unique.

[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:52.320]
It's like in everyone's voices. Unique. So I mean, you know, you have your laugh. Yeah.

[00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:56.780]
But I work. I enjoy. I enjoy. I enjoy. I say I got a guy. He's a unique.

[00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:03.180]
He's stuck. Scandals or whatever. She was into. I mean, I don't know. But I hurt.

[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:06.340]
She wasn't very good looking. So I'm glad I didn't go all the way out to see

[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:11.400]
you. Smith. Mark. Who was that tiny Tim West? Oh, God. Tiny Tim. Really? Is that what

[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:16.700]
you look like? And she's the one that said that. Well, I don't know. He's patterned

[00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:21.040]
yourself after tiny Tim. He's saying, alright. But she's, you know, just, I don't know.

[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:27.080]
She just had something missing. You know, there was something like a brain. Oh, God.

[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:31.440]
Poor Kathy. I hope you two are still friends after. We are. Although I don't know what she

[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.420]
really told Linda, I guess we'll read it on Monday in the hero. Maybe tomorrow.

[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:40.000]
Oh, boy. Okay. Well, listen, I just wanted to call on say, Neil, I support you so

[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.460]
far, effort. And I'm going to be sent away real soon for petition. What the heck? I'll find

[00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:51.420]
25 people somehow. Great. But I enjoy the show as always. It's always great. And

[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:56.280]
Glenn keep up the good work and really give those whims in Miramar a hard time.

[00:27:56.340 --> 00:28:00.660]
Because I can't believe that a city that I was raised in and a high school I went to.

[00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:05.780]
I can't believe they can be so spying with me. Come on. Give me a break. Okay. Thanks a lot.

[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.680]
Alright. Take care. Okay. Great car. Wouldn't you say it was good? Absolutely.

[00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:12.280]
And Tinkled a lot, but he was good. Next car is on a mobile phone. Hello.

[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:16.580]
Hey, Neil. Congratulations on your ratings. Oh, that was good. Another one of those antiques

[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:23.660]
in Damia. Sunrise. Hello. Neil. Yes. Oh, you can hear me. Oh, I thought it was close

[00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:27.140]
away. Better going nuts now. You know, it's getting close to two o'clock and Ernie's

[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:30.480]
going to come on to go nuts. It can handle it. I like the answer for a favor.

[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:35.420]
For the past five weeks, I've been trying to explain to my wife, Patty, about the different

[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:39.160]
bits you do and the things you play in trying to describe the Michael Jackson thing.

[00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:43.400]
And I know you really are not crazy about people calling and requesting. But if you can

[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.800]
play that with an X-T-S-R, I appreciate it.

[00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:52.460]
Hello. This is Michael Jackson. Ernie, you'd to help stop the spread of social disease.

[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:56.780]
Don't risk your life by having a romantic encounter with an unfamiliar police.

[00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:01.980]
I urge you to do like I do. Go it alone. But make sure you wear protection.

[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:04.960]
That's why I recommend the Michael Jackson glove.

[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:10.500]
More than on either hand, the Michael Jackson glove adds the security piece of mind that I need

[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:16.540]
to do it myself. So remember, before you throw that, put it on. And...

[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:22.960]
The Michael Jackson glove, proving once again that I've heard on the hand is better than one in the

[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:25.780]
Bush, the available and frequent models for extra stimulation.

[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:29.680]
Okay, now this next call is either from LaBelle or from Patty LaBelle. Hello.

[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:30.680]
Yeah, Neil.

[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:31.680]
Hey, good day.

[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:35.880]
A long time listener talk radio on South Florida. I lived many years in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.760]
And we were in LaBelle, which is the county seat of Henry County.

[00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:39.180]
Right.

[00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:42.840]
And we are about 30 miles from Fort Myers.

[00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:48.320]
And we are really up on what's going on pretty much through your efforts with the

[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:55.720]
teams a lot of times. And also we are a record store. And we receive billboard all time.

[00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:01.020]
And it's quite interesting, like you say, with the controversy that, you know,

[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:05.920]
if people didn't want to listen to some of the shows, they could turn them off.

[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:10.200]
And listen to some of the other stations. I have some friends that work for

[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:14.080]
in the technical department of another station that you mentioned quite often.

[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:15.620]
That's on 441.

[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:16.360]
Oh, yeah.

[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.980]
Are they playing in traffic today?

[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:20.080]
No.

[00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:20.800]
No.

[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:21.360]
No.

[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.860]
I don't know what their station is.

[00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:28.480]
But I have, like I said, most of the long time friends that do work in a technical

[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:35.280]
people over there. And one of your former production people is now the news director of our

[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:36.520]
local radio station up here.

[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:37.120]
Who's that?

[00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:37.680]
No, only.

[00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:41.960]
I can't remember his last name. I just met him the other day. He just came up here last

[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:46.060]
Monday. He worked in production at Winds because he came in the other day and said,

[00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:47.620]
hey, that's my old station on the air.

[00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:52.580]
And he is on the air up here.

[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:53.820]
They have 3,000 watts.

[00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:56.500]
So they have a big listening audience.

[00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:58.880]
They're basically a country station.

[00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:03.580]
But the Miramar High School thing is very interesting because here in

[00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:07.180]
Libel, which I described as being two hours and 30 years away from Miami,

[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.700]
the Libel High School prom, guess what their theme is.

[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:12.780]
Never say goodbye.

[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:13.740]
How'd you guess?

[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:15.400]
In La Belle.

[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:16.000]
Yeah.

[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:20.060]
Oh, man, I'm telling you. These kids over in Miramar, they ought to hang their heads in shame.

[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:26.900]
And the interesting part about this county is our basic images,

[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:28.980]
you know, good old boys right next to them.

[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.020]
You scratch the surface.

[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:38.920]
Like myself there from New Jersey or lived many years in Chicago or New York or South Florida.

[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:42.320]
You know, in Miami, Fort Lauderdale area.

[00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:48.260]
And that's hard of all the silliness like the Highlandale Commandos and so forth.

[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:48.600]
Yeah.

[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:55.180]
I remember back when some of the other 12 people first came to Miami.

[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:56.800]
And they were quite interesting.

[00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:00.280]
But over the years, it gets very boring listening to the same thing over and over.

[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:07.360]
And I lived for many years just outside the city of Dania.

[00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:11.620]
We were involved with some of the politics and then the round-broward county.

[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:15.500]
And it's amazing how long they let some of these politicians still stay in office.

[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:15.740]
Yeah.

[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:18.620]
Millet, listen, it's just about everybody weighing for Lauderdale.

[00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:21.620]
So there's nobody left to vote them out.

[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:22.660]
This is true.

[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.100]
This is true because the area I live in we're outside La Belle and everybody has two and a half acres.

[00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:33.520]
Almost all our neighbors with very few exceptions are from South Barred.

[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:33.860]
Hmm.

[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:41.600]
And we're talking about, you know, 600 different people, you know, which is a small area up here,

[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:43.140]
but you know, compared to Broward.

[00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:47.000]
And we're down there quite a bit, you know, for business reasons and everything.

[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:53.200]
And it's like you say, how in the old Marching West in South and whatever.

[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:53.800]
Yeah.

[00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:57.720]
The sunny Rosenberg Deaths Syndrome is covering the whole area.

[00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:00.360]
Pretty soon they'll be moving north from South Johnson.

[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:03.000]
How in the old habit to give them that too at times, you know.

[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:03.900]
Like what?

[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:06.340]
They're one Chinese restaurant there.

[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:10.700]
It's on Federal and, how in the old Beach Boulevard?

[00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:15.380]
Chinese.

[00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:16.020]
They can name it.

[00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:18.020]
We're in there one time about a couple months back.

[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:18.260]
Yeah.

[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:18.860]
Pretty decent.

[00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:19.380]
Okay.

[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.040]
Well, pretty decent is one thing, but sensational is.

[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:22.600]
Oh, okay.

[00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:23.540]
Well, we're going to go now.

[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:28.780]
We're comparing to some of, you know, living in the country and going to the big city type.

[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:29.620]
It's pretty decent.

[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:30.040]
Yeah.

[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:32.460]
Well, I bet you they got great cuisine in La Belle, huh?

[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:32.820]
Yes.

[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:33.260]
Yes.

[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:35.220]
Are specialty at swamp cabbage.

[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:40.280]
We have a big swamp cabbage festival every year, which is why most of the people

[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:41.620]
get swamp fever up there.

[00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:43.620]
Not really.

[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:50.060]
Mostly people are pretty, pretty much up ahead of what's going on.

[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:54.420]
And in fact, I don't know if you saw a billboard this week about the

[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:59.540]
Clare Cup in Bay County, which is up in the panhandle, was arrested for selling two albums.

[00:33:59.580 --> 00:33:59.980]
Oh, yeah.

[00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:00.500]
Album.

[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:00.940]
Yeah.

[00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:07.080]
In fact, I heard it first on the news on your show last week, sometime in the North

[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:10.500]
one distributor we deal with all the time my MAA mentioned it.

[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:17.800]
And that has been the number one seller in South Florida for months now.

[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:23.440]
In fact, when their full-inch dance record came out in the fall,

[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:26.980]
kids were begging for it.

[00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:28.600]
And that was the dirty version of it.

[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.040]
The album has the clean version.

[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:31.480]
Yeah.

[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:35.420]
So I can imagine what these people do if they heard the other version.

[00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:36.980]
Thank you.

[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:37.620]
Thank you.

[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:38.700]
First thing for a long time.

[00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:39.840]
Sometimes we don't get the call.

[00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:42.580]
And this record said we do run a record store.

[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:46.760]
We keep up on what's going on pretty much with the entertainment industry.

[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:51.300]
26 after what at WINZ.

[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:53.220]
I'll make a deal starting next Saturday.

[00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:57.360]
I'll come in about 9.15, 9.29, 30 maybe.

[00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:01.240]
And Glenn will stick around till about 10, 20 or 10, 30 and that's it.

[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:02.700]
That's all across over what we're going to do.

[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.300]
And I can overdo this during the week.

[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:07.320]
We're going to sit him over in the corner in the room.

[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:08.760]
He can laugh way in the background.

[00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.960]
So only people with good hearing can hear it.

[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:14.680]
I don't want to get blamed for everybody else for their success,

[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:18.600]
for their failure, for when they quit, for when they have a baby.

[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:20.200]
I mean, how can I get blamed for that?

[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:21.800]
You know, I mean, that's really reaching.

[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:25.360]
It's incredible.

[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.020]
Beer field, hello.

[00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:27.740]
Yeah, Neil.

[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:28.240]
Yes.

[00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:29.140]
What are you doing at work?

[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:30.400]
Should be a golf stream.

[00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:30.840]
I know.

[00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:33.580]
That's what I'm going about now.

[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:34.200]
Great.

[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:36.560]
I'm going to go bet that can fucking derby.

[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:37.080]
Who are you betting?

[00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:38.200]
Don't.

[00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:40.660]
Come on now.

[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.280]
Are you serious?

[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.100]
Hey, Dick was on the other day.

[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:44.600]
Yeah.

[00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:47.260]
And he said that they couldn't,

[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:49.820]
golf couldn't win if he had a van to take him there.

[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:50.480]
It wasn't golf.

[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.900]
I bet the articles, the parties they were talking about.

[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:55.200]
Well, let me tell you, they can put gulch right on the,

[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.400]
make it a milk wagon and put them side by side.

[00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.160]
You don't like them, huh?

[00:35:58.460 --> 00:35:59.800]
When they hit the top of the stretch,

[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:00.880]
gulch will be in reverse.

[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:04.960]
And by the way, his dosage index is 4.71.

[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:10.100]
Anything over four, no horse with a dosage index of over four

[00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:11.500]
has ever won the derby.

[00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:12.080]
Uh-oh.

[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:12.980]
I'm in trouble.

[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:15.780]
Now listen, I don't want to tell you.

[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:16.380]
Yeah, I know.

[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:17.620]
Look at that.

[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.640]
We just got food coming here that you wouldn't believe.

[00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:23.360]
Hey, me, I was going to tell you, you know, when you had that

[00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:28.160]
early bird special, they should make a steak race, early bird steaks.

[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:29.340]
They do have them.

[00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:30.980]
They have early bird stallion steaks.

[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:31.880]
It's right in the program.

[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:37.300]
Well, they should have like 100 old people have a seven-throw-and-raise.

[00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:40.500]
And at the finish, we're going to set up lobster shrimp and steak.

[00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:41.100]
Yeah.

[00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:42.080]
And we'll let them go.

[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:43.660]
And you can be the stew it.

[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:46.060]
Excellent.

[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:47.680]
What inquiries?

[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.960]
You'll be behind a board for about an hour.

[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:50.620]
You bet.

[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.140]
Well, it's a good luck in a day, baby.

[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:53.820]
You're lucky.

[00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:55.680]
I hope you win a million to that.

[00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:59.520]
We've got somebody frying at a dayed payphone.

[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:01.080]
Happy would be excited about this.

[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:01.540]

[00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:02.800]
Hey, Neil.

[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:04.020]
Are you really frying?

[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.760]
Why you're on the hot seat now, sir?

[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.060]
Hey, listen, Neil.

[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.820]
It's really been a pleasure listening to you.

[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:12.600]
I've been listening to you for about a week now.

[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:15.960]
I got time to fall asleep at the wheel on the SM.

[00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:19.520]
So I turned your dial on and it's been pretty interesting.

[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:21.220]
Welcome to the real world, sir.

[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:22.020]
Yeah, all right.

[00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:25.100]
What I want to talk to you about is Taffy.

[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:26.320]
He's really disturbing.

[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:26.960]
Yes.

[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:28.800]
The real disturbing.

[00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:31.380]
I had a chance to listen to her yesterday.

[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.300]
I've been listening to you all week and I've been hearing you talk about.

[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:37.600]
Finally, I listened to her yesterday and I sort of got sick.

[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:39.300]
I had to stop the truck and pull over.

[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:41.740]
She's unbelievable.

[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.140]
She wants to stop the truck and bend over.

[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:47.300]
She wants to stop everybody.

[00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:49.280]
I just couldn't believe my ears.

[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:50.860]
And she says she's well educated.

[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:52.100]
I'll tell you one thing.

[00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:54.720]
When she has guests in her home, they all stand up.

[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:55.740]
They never sit down.

[00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:57.740]
They don't trust that woman.

[00:37:58.560 --> 00:37:59.680]
She's totally unbelievable.

[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:02.600]
And you know, the funny things she was talking about,

[00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:04.560]
truck dealers and how they got taught,

[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.320]
she should execute all the truck dealers.

[00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:10.240]
And that's for his home and me because I know some personal friends

[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.660]
that got sort of caught up in the business.

[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:13.680]
They're not really bad people.

[00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:15.680]
They just got caught up in the wrong thing.

[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:19.400]
And now they're out and they're enjoying their life.

[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:23.200]
They're doing well and just think of what if she was an officer

[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.280]
wherever she was, they'd be dead.

[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:26.960]
Sort of depressing.

[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:29.540]
Yeah, Taffy's going into business with premise Rajesh.

[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:32.380]
I see.

[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:33.460]
She's a real trip.

[00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:36.740]
I just don't know where she got her education from.

[00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:37.840]
Where is that Smith College?

[00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:39.180]
Smith College.

[00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:42.140]
Well, dignified and proprietary.

[00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:43.440]
He was the name of the game.

[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:44.680]
It's a whole, yeah.

[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.760]
Yeah, well, she doesn't come across to intelligence.

[00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:48.480]
It's amazing, tight.

[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.720]
Quite you see the problem is all these most of the listeners in this town

[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:54.400]
and probably in all town, they play personality.

[00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:56.240]
You know, why am I picking on Taffy?

[00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:59.440]
And she can come on every day and she can see the most outrageous,

[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:02.000]
the most objectionable, racist, bigoted,

[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:04.660]
disgusting, genocidal,

[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.320]
of maniacal things.

[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:08.220]
Why are you picking on death?

[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:10.100]
And all these young suits, you know,

[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:12.800]
call in like she's saying something that makes sense.

[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:14.540]
I mean, this woman spews,

[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:16.900]
she makes Hitler look like Santa Claus.

[00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:18.140]
It's unbelievable.

[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:18.760]
Yes.

[00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:20.680]
And I'm supposed to sit here and oh, well,

[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:23.380]
you know, she never stole a freight train and be Mr. Nice guy.

[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:24.100]
All right.

[00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:25.820]
One of these listeners is going to grow up, you know,

[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:27.600]
it's only related to his personalities.

[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.660]
I mean, the substance of anything that is said

[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:31.560]
just flies right on by.

[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:32.420]
What personality?

[00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:33.780]
flies right on by.

[00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:37.080]
You don't know what personality you're talking about.

[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:37.640]
I know.

[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:38.860]
I tell you, she's real scary.

[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:41.880]
I, you know, a lot of people joke about it,

[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.300]
but, you know,

[00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:45.680]
some of the things she thinks about,

[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:47.240]
I just don't know where she gets them.

[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:50.080]
I don't know if she gets them out of comics or...

[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:51.820]
I mean, she thinks she thought that the Gestapo

[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:53.620]
was a bunch of school crossing guards.

[00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:54.820]
I'm serious.

[00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:57.580]
I don't believe in that.

[00:39:57.580 --> 00:39:57.680]
I don't believe in that.

[00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:59.920]
Anyway, I just like to say I enjoy listening to you.

[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:01.520]
Good thing she's not on the weekend

[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:04.100]
because the initial would be the Saturday show.

[00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:05.500]
The initials would be SS.

[00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:06.600]
I'm so happy.

[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:08.380]
Have a nice weekend.

[00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:09.320]
Take care.

[00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:09.780]
Okay.

[00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:13.440]
Like she and Nancy Sinatra are going to make a record.

[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:14.720]
These boots were made for...

[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:16.880]
M World Hills, hello.

[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:17.340]
Hello.

[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:18.200]
How you doing?

[00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:18.880]
Just me over the K.

[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:19.820]
Me over the K.

[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:20.620]
All right. Hey, Doc.

[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:22.500]
I was listening to this morning

[00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:23.640]
you're talking about WPLP.

[00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:24.420]
Yeah.

[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:24.960]
You remember,

[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:25.700]
do you have...

[00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:27.060]
And your friend was saying that you remember

[00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:28.360]
that when it was WFFO?

[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:29.720]
Right.

[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:30.140]
Right.

[00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:30.680]
Yeah.

[00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:31.320]
Remember it?

[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:32.600]
One of the DJs on there,

[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:33.560]
Chuck, do you Farley?

[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:35.440]
Pretty nice for you.

[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:36.920]
His name was Charlie Farley Show.

[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:38.660]
And it was Chuck, do you Farley?

[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:39.440]
Oh my God.

[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:40.680]
I don't remember that.

[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:42.600]
Or Lasseter would have worked well on that stage.

[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:43.340]
12 years ago.

[00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:44.060]
Couldn't believe it.

[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:44.880]
Now you're serious.

[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.420]
Sometimes I swear to you.

[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.540]
It was great.

[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:50.480]
That was the best Rock and Roll radio station in Florida.

[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:51.000]
Yeah.

[00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:52.320]
They used to be like...

[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:52.460]
Right.

[00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:53.100]
If it's, I mean, they...

[00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:53.880]
What was your best music?

[00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:55.400]
They were the big 57.

[00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:55.800]
Right.

[00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:56.260]
We could...

[00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:57.380]
I mean, I'm from Winter Haven.

[00:40:57.860 --> 00:40:58.580]
Couldn't even hear it.

[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.080]
We listened to static just to hear it.

[00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:01.060]
I never heard of it.

[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:01.480]
Powered.

[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:03.480]
Well, they used to be on only in the daytime.

[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.020]
They went 24 hours.

[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:06.720]
And a week later, they went all-touch.

[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:07.580]
And I'm believe it.

[00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:08.840]
I remember WLCY.

[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:09.400]
Right.

[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:09.940]
Yeah.

[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:12.200]
I can another thing to mention too,

[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:13.860]
you guys about Chipper Gore?

[00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:14.700]
Yeah.

[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:16.480]
You got your dictionary there, Neil.

[00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:19.020]
Look up, Gore, and the dictionary talking about

[00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:21.020]
things being having two meanings.

[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:22.620]
Look up the word Gore.

[00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:24.540]
Where's the dictionary?

[00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:25.660]
Is something you take out of there?

[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:26.300]
It's...

[00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:28.120]
What you're gonna read there is gonna be...

[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:28.900]
It's gonna be typical.

[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:29.680]
Oh, there it is.

[00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:31.700]
Somebody was trying to hide it under Taffy's

[00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:32.640]
electrified seat.

[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.200]
I can't believe it.

[00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:35.100]
We get that out of here.

[00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:36.480]
Would you give me the dictionary, please?

[00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:39.200]
Got all these naked pictures hidden back there.

[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:40.320]
I can't stand it.

[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:43.680]
Under Taffy's seat, no less.

[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:44.200]
That's all you see.

[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:45.780]
She hit him under there.

[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:46.460]
Well, I tell you.

[00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:49.480]
Look out for those women with a whips and chains.

[00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:52.120]
Vinny Testiverty picture.

[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:52.560]
Yeah.

[00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:54.240]
Vinny Greenboat.

[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:55.820]
Cover's the whole wall, by the way.

[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:56.440]
It's disgusting.

[00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:58.040]
Okay, Gore.

[00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:00.700]
Gorge.

[00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:02.180]
Gore.

[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:03.440]
Okay, Gore.

[00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:06.460]
To cut into a tapering triangular form.

[00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:07.040]
There's one.

[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:08.680]
To provide with a Gore.

[00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:12.320]
A small, usually triangular piece of land.

[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:15.120]
A tapering or triangular piece

[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:17.440]
as a cloth in a skirt.

[00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:20.980]
To pierce or wound with a horn or a tusk.

[00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:21.480]
Yeah, these

[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:23.400]
blottered.

[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:24.320]
Clotted blood.

[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:29.080]
That's it.

[00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:29.660]
That's it.

[00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:30.220]
Unbelievable.

[00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:33.520]
If they look kind of a lousy dictionary is this.

[00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:35.520]
So it seems to bludgeon or it's a piece of life.

[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:36.600]
It depends on your use.

[00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:38.900]
And if the use of a woman is walking around,

[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:40.740]
telling her, by the different means so and so,

[00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:41.700]
that means so and so.

[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:43.420]
Can't play this record.

[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:44.320]
Can't play that record.

[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:46.780]
Unbelievable.

[00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:47.360]
Yeah.

[00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:49.120]
While she's a piece of,

[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:50.260]
yeah, she's a piece of gold.

[00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:51.160]
It's a work, yeah.

[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:53.140]
Let's see what else there isn't there.

[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:54.040]
Here, I want to talk about it.

[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:55.780]
I was at the park, where we gave no food.

[00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:58.500]
I was, I was,

[00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:00.680]
don't you know what the problem with the park was

[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:02.900]
that you, they had you guys not on a stage.

[00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:04.320]
If you're a little elevated,

[00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:05.780]
it was like, you know,

[00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:07.860]
if you were two people back around the ring

[00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:08.820]
that they put around you,

[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:10.280]
you couldn't see.

[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.260]
That's what nobody could see.

[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:12.680]
I think.

[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:14.060]
Well, thank goodness for that.

[00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:14.920]
I have a good boy.

[00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:16.160]
It was like walking.

[00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:17.280]
It was like the surface.

[00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:19.100]
Well, that's not why we're not doing anymore, though.

[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:19.380]
I know.

[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:21.540]
It's always an unmitigated disaster,

[00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:23.040]
you know, like we yesterday show.

[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:23.580]
It's, uh,

[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:25.460]
thank God they served beer there.

[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:27.400]
That's where I kept running to.

[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:27.800]
Yeah.

[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:29.020]
Okay, well, it's some good luck.

[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:29.640]
Hey, talking to you.

[00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:30.360]
Have a great life.

[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:30.700]
Yeah.

[00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:33.440]
Somebody called me to tell me the channel seven now

[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:34.700]
on the baseball game,

[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:36.520]
Neil Heaton is pitching against the

[00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:37.740]
Metz.

[00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:39.360]
Who cares?

[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:41.800]
What kind of a message is that?

[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:44.160]
I couldn't hear about either one of them.

[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:48.220]
Boy, Neil Heaton.

[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.600]
And they brought his brother in the picture,

[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:53.260]
you old man boy, he was a bright guy.

[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:55.340]
He was great.

[00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:57.320]
Okay, 25 till two.

[00:43:58.020 --> 00:43:58.840]
At W.I. and Z,

[00:43:58.920 --> 00:43:59.860]
we do have one open line.

[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:01.660]
We thank Phil and the people from the deli then.

[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:02.920]
Although, I don't know if that's for me,

[00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:04.040]
though, what am I thanking him for?

[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:04.760]
He brought in a lot of food.

[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:05.680]
That's probably for Ernie.

[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:08.360]
You know, Ernie steals all of my sponsors anyway.

[00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:09.060]
That's for Ernie.

[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:13.320]
Right.

[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:15.300]
Come on Phil, be honest with me.

[00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:15.920]
And at cheesecake,

[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:16.880]
no.

[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:18.480]
It's got a circle you wanted.

[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:19.380]
I can't believe it.

[00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:20.980]
It's from the circle you ranch.

[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:25.340]
See, that's what happens when you become super Jew.

[00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:26.240]
That's Ernie Sochin.

[00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:27.780]
He just super Jew.

[00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:30.900]
Ernie Subject today, Jews in Miramar.

[00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:32.920]
Can't believe it.

[00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:36.400]
So I make fun of us doing what is all that stuff.

[00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:37.500]
This is Jewish food.

[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:38.640]
This is Haman Tosh.

[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:39.040]
You've been watching.

[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:39.340]
Oh, I'm going to be a little bit more honest.

[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:39.340]

[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:40.500]
Oh, my God.

[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:41.980]
What's the hell on that?

[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:44.620]
Thank you for making fun of us Jewish guys.

[00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:45.480]
You're really not getting it.

[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:46.200]
You're a scholar and a gentleman.

[00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:46.800]
That's great.

[00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:48.900]
We could end up bringing a sandwich with like bread.

[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:50.040]
Who invited you in here, Ernie?

[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:51.900]
I had a Gary the Haman Tosh and the man.

[00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:53.040]
Ask me the Haman Tosh.

[00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:54.500]
No, they prune or poppy seed.

[00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:55.620]
I hope they're poppy seed.

[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:56.420]
Oh, thank you.

[00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:57.680]
Phil knows I won't eat the prune.

[00:44:58.380 --> 00:44:59.840]
And look at that layout.

[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:00.620]
Man, that's good.

[00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:02.320]
That's for my new housewarming this weekend.

[00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:04.820]
He didn't even know I was moving, did you?

[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.260]
Okay, let's do our second break here.

[00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:08.620]
And I think we may start.

[00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:09.520]
We may start eating.

[00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:14.860]
Know what it costs to open a home equity credit line at American savings?

[00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:20.240]
Every day I examine cells and for the people in the audience who can't share the good food.

[00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:22.420]
Tough, you know, that's get you on show.

[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:24.520]
You know, I didn't get these poppy seeds out of your teeth.

[00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:26.920]
Man, I'm telling you, these are Haman Tosh and that are so good.

[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:28.700]
Would you like some Kyle with sitting here?

[00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:29.400]
He wouldn't.

[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:29.920]
He wouldn't know what he's doing.

[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:30.860]
He'll have some of the sandwiches.

[00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:31.860]
But he won't even know how to put him.

[00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:32.480]
Don't worry about him.

[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:33.480]
He'll put some stuff in his way.

[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:34.500]
He'll plan how to Haman Tosh and?

[00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:35.480]
No, he doesn't have.

[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:35.860]

[00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:36.720]
The Haman will.

[00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:36.820]

[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:37.400]
Believe me.

[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:38.360]
No, but here and here.

[00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:39.260]
He's going to be done.

[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:40.180]
I'm not gonna.

[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:41.260]
I'm just leaving him alone.

[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:42.120]
They just leave him alone.

[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:42.360]
They don't know.

[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:43.120]
They're nice people.

[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:44.740]
Okay, let's take a call from the girl.

[00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:47.620]
But then we only got a few minutes left and everybody wants to hear something.

[00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:49.540]
Which is good because that'll kill time while we eat.

[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:51.160]
Hello.

[00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:52.360]
Hey, oh, good afternoon.

[00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:53.080]
How you doing?

[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:53.680]
Great.

[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:55.200]
So you're using me to kill time, huh?

[00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:56.760]
Yeah, you talking, will eat.

[00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:59.420]
Okay, I got a new subject for you.

[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:03.160]
I want to talk a little bit about the legislation legislation that was...

[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:03.880]
Oh, good. I'm leaving.

[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:04.600]
Why not?

[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:07.140]
And is this a set up call?

[00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:09.340]
No, no.

[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:16.300]
I couldn't understand how lawyers would pass this law that would tax their services.

[00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:20.160]
And there aren't that many lawyers up there amazingly.

[00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:25.380]
Well, I think I may have come up with the answer on the radio the other day.

[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:30.420]
I heard that now that the tax legislation has passed and we're going to pay for services

[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:35.000]
on our dry cleaning and all taxes on our dry cleaning and all sorts of other services.

[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:39.540]
The lawyers are now going to file suit from what I believe I heard on the radio.

[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:46.120]
We're going to file suit to prevent this tax from going through for legal fees

[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:50.360]
because it prevents the poor from having access to the court.

[00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:55.020]
And, you know, it just amazes me.

[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.900]
I don't know why, but I just knew there was some angle

[00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:01.420]
that they're suing themselves.

[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:03.080]
Yeah. Exactly.

[00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:07.100]
What about the poor being able to get their clothes dry clean?

[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:08.280]
I mean, what the...

[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:08.540]
Yeah.

[00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:11.360]
You know, that's all I wanted to comment on.

[00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:15.280]
I wanted to get your comments to see what your thoughts were.

[00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:19.000]
Let me tell you what it has to do with anything going on in Tallahassee.

[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:21.800]
You might as well just put your head in the sand and cry.

[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:22.940]
That's all I can tell you.

[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:23.800]
It is so embarrassing.

[00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:26.000]
There are such a bunch of gutless,

[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.640]
finest cowards up there.

[00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:28.460]
It's beyond belief.

[00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:31.600]
And that includes both parties, both parties.

[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:33.180]
It's incredible.

[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:35.660]
If you wonder why people don't take any interest in politics

[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:37.720]
in this state and in this country,

[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:39.920]
all you have to do is take a look at what most of them are doing.

[00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:45.020]
Well, I might take this moment to also to comment on our

[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:48.440]
automobile insurance and the fact that, you know,

[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:50.700]
I think it's liability insurance is not required.

[00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:58.320]
And it just causes those of us who want to go without insurance.

[00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:00.880]
Those of us who have anything at all in this world

[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:04.120]
who to protect or just wouldn't do that to other people.

[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:05.180]
To pay through the nose.

[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:05.700]
That's right.

[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:06.640]
You got it.

[00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:07.380]
That's right.

[00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:08.940]
I did a show on it here a couple of months ago.

[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:11.680]
We had the whole panel here and everybody blings everybody else.

[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:13.680]
And in the meantime, we can't do anything right.

[00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:14.720]
You're in Florida, my friend.

[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:15.520]
What can I tell you?

[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:16.440]
It's...

[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:17.300]
I am Newtapar.

[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:19.260]
This is the Not Know How State.

[00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:19.980]
Where you're from?

[00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:24.700]
Well, I grew up in the New Jersey, New York area.

[00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:25.360]
Oh, wow.

[00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:25.740]
Listen.

[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:27.300]
But I came to...

[00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:28.860]
I went to school in Florida, believe it or not.

[00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:32.020]
I have lived in many different places including overseas.

[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:35.080]
And I came back to the Grove.

[00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:35.900]
I like the Grove.

[00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:37.980]
So...

[00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:39.200]
But it's fascinating.

[00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:41.340]
It's a different culture.

[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:42.820]
And it just...

[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:47.380]
To me, it doesn't make any legislative sense to pass a law that makes

[00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:51.640]
your tax was different from other states.

[00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:52.180]
Well, don't forget.

[00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:53.360]
This is Governor No Tax.

[00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:54.240]
Yeah.

[00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:56.060]
People find their way around it.

[00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:58.820]
I mean, they do in New York and New Jersey every day where the

[00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:02.540]
New Jersey don't tax clothing or food.

[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:03.700]
And New York, they do.

[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:08.980]
And everybody goes from New York to New Jersey and buys their clothing and food

[00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:10.520]
and they gasp when the tax is lower.

[00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:12.200]
I mean, people find their way around it.

[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:13.560]
But the poor people won't.

[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:16.440]
So, you know, they're not helping anybody.

[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:19.540]
Yeah, well, it's probably a cashier or a plot we're all going to be getting on ships and

[00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:22.260]
going to Havana by our...

[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:23.700]
Take our dry cleaning.

[00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:25.940]
Well, that might be interesting.

[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:26.260]
Yeah.

[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:28.200]
Or to China for that matter.

[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:29.480]
You know, get a good Chinese laundry.

[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:31.220]
Well, listen, hang in there and welcome to Florida.

[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:33.880]
I wanted to say a Chinese laundry's in Tavetta.

[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:36.120]
You're in for some real surprises. Trust me.

[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:36.840]
Okay.

[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:37.540]
Good luck.

[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:38.140]
Interesting.

[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:38.540]
Bye-bye.

[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:44.560]
Okay, it's 17 before 2 at WINZ.

[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:46.880]
What all these people want from us?

[00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:50.120]
You know, they just want us to keep playing the same stuff over and over.

[00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:50.960]
They don't want to hear me.

[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:53.500]
They're disgusted with Glenn and his laugh.

[00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:56.500]
They're not happy about the good food that came in here.

[00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:59.160]
Couples, concerned about...

[00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:02.500]
Protect condoms.

[00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:04.080]
A division of Black, Black, House, and Garden,

[00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:04.820]
pest control division.

[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:07.160]
CP situation states since 1887.

[00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:16.540]
The

[00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:16.540]

[00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:17.540]
The

[00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:22.420]
Ten records that you've been waiting for.

[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:25.720]
Tammy Faye's unbelievable new album.

[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:27.140]
Here's the rock.

[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:29.380]
I called out from under.

[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:34.180]
I've got six pink tones of makeup on.

[00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:36.560]
Been my husband does it.

[00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:38.340]
Big kids that cut down.

[00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:40.860]
Oh, bad for a cowl.

[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.520]
And go out with

[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:47.880]
a mouth drum and a round booms in two.

[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:49.120]
It's all here.

[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:50.080]
The headache.

[00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:51.100]
The headache.

[00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:52.520]
The pancake.

[00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:54.740]
Rock-a-face.

[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:58.180]
Just in my face.

[00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:01.040]
My man's care.

[00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:02.420]
Rumble.

[00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:03.700]
We're right.

[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:06.960]
Tammy Faye's here's the rock.

[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:08.720]
But I called out from under.

[00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:10.080]
Won't you buy my new album?

[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:11.520]
If you don't, you're burning hair.

[00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:12.720]
I'll just be the way you know.

[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:14.280]
Sign to you, I'll bless you.

[00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:16.200]
Okay, should we take a call from Helen Dale,

[00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:19.180]
even with all the roast beef and corn beef

[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:21.140]
and humontosh and bomb tonne?

[00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:21.760]
What a spread.

[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:24.400]
There's even a little cake here that says seven share.

[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:27.120]
These people at the deli den are incredible.

[00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:27.540]
Hello.

[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.260]
Hi, but you shouldn't be talking about that food

[00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:31.340]
when I don't have any.

[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:32.900]
Hi, Neil and Glenn.

[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:33.500]
Hi, you're doing.

[00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:33.800]
Oh.

[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:35.540]
Let me ask you.

[00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:36.020]
Are you reading?

[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:36.700]
Are you overweight?

[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:37.660]
No.

[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:39.680]
Well, start working on it.

[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:43.860]
I don't tell you about was the

[00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:48.460]
work at the planets that you choose.

[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:51.700]
You should be picking Jupiter or Pluto or Mars

[00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:54.820]
because Uranus is just a little too suggestive.

[00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:58.340]
And I think that we get all of our petitions in.

[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:01.080]
Yeah, we ought to potentially Uranus.

[00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:02.360]
Yeah, we'll have to wait on that.

[00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:03.100]
Okay.

[00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:07.520]
Okay, I enjoyed your show for long time.

[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:08.900]
Since you come on, I...

[00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:10.800]
Now listen, all you science teachers out there

[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:11.860]
want you to listen to this gentleman.

[00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:12.720]
He's got a good point.

[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:16.220]
When you go up and show the kids the solar system on the mat,

[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:17.320]
cover Uranus.

[00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:19.360]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:21.000]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.180]
Boy, well, you covered yours with that.

[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:23.660]
You bet.

[00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:28.000]
Okay, uh, uh, keep listening and get our petition in.

[00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:28.520]
Good luck.

[00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:29.120]
Thank you, sir.

[00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:29.460]
All right.

[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:31.340]
We mean man has got to have shul.

[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:32.280]
What, it was at me.

[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:34.220]
But what does that mean?

[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:35.820]
I get these messages on the screen.

[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:37.040]
He's got to have shul.

[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:38.300]
What do they do?

[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:39.280]
Close on Shabbos?

[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:40.780]
Pretty unlikely story, pal.

[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:43.240]
Man has got to have shul or what?

[00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:44.920]
He's standing there with a gun to his head

[00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:45.740]
and the most we play it.

[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:46.500]
He's pulling the trigger.

[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:48.840]
Let's take a pull.

[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:49.400]
When...

[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:03.120]
I'm going to have shul.

[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:04.160]
It's over.

[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:05.400]
Why did that mean?

[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:07.760]
I'll say it.

[00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:08.700]
Give a thousand words.

[00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:09.080]
Okay.

[00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:10.180]
We have shul.

I'm shul.

[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:15.640]
I'm shul.

[00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:17.020]
You're shul.

[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:17.580]
You're shul.

[00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:18.560]

You're shul.
