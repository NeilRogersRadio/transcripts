[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.420]
I run my bike 30 miles every Saturday to the list.

[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.900]
And this guy calls me names.

[00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.260]
Shame on you, sir.

[00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:09.880]
Shame on you.

[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.620]
By the way, have you seen some of those bad boys at the new AMP?

[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.300]
No, what are you cackling about?

[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.240]
A, good.

[00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.360]
This is my gun.

[00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.460]
A million producers in the world.

[00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.380]
And they stick me in here with an A.

[00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.300]
Shut it, my god.

[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.860]
Semicar castle.

[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.440]
Hello.

[00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:40.440]
How many?

[00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.020]
You're supposed to be such a nice boy.

[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.080]
And now you're so terrible.

[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.400]
Yeah, but you can't share it off.

[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.000]
You can't share it off.

[00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.060]
I don't need this.

[00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.500]
I have offers from other stations.

[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.740]
Patavia, Almira, Fredonia.

[00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:09.440]
But instead, I stay here and entertain you grotesque sub-human dutabag.

[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.480]
Unbelievable.

[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.840]
Geneva, hello.

[00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.860]
Hello, is this Neil Rogers?

[00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.240]
What kind of phone are you on, sir?

[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.700]
How's that again?

[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.500]
Do you have a dial phone or a watt?

[00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.180]
No, I have to put it to the operator.

[00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.020]
Let's...

[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.320]
Let's...

[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.260]
Let's not get into that.

[00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.560]
Hey, I was listening to Joey Reynolds on WKBW last night.

[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.860]
Somebody asked you.

[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.320]
Did you hear what he's been saying about you?

[00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.080]
No, I don't listen anymore.

[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.200]
He's a daughtering old man.

[00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.380]
He claims he's only 40.

[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.440]
Yeah, right.

[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.760]
And do we be true in two?

[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.320]
Oh, shut up.

[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.380]
And you're up a stomach.

[00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.000]
And if you think he's bad now, wait until he hatches.

[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.800]
Oh, boy.

[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.000]
Okay, when we come back, maybe the egg will come out of his shell.

[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.900]
But I hope not.

[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.060]
Little radio history there.

[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.480]
Sell them heard before.

[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.680]
And you heard it first on Zeta4.

[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.380]
7-14 on a Friday morning.

[00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.340]
And our next caller is probably in Broward County, disappeared.

[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.220]
Hello, are you there?

[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.780]
I can't believe it. He held on.

[00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.340]
Frightening.

[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.760]
Go ahead.

[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.780]
First lead.

[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.240]
What?

[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.560]
First lead.

[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.520]
Where is Lee?

[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.620]
First complaint.

[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.120]
How long have you been listening, sir?

[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.220]
Four days.

[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.100]
No, no, I mean this morning.

[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.200]
How long have you been listening?

[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.860]
About ten minutes.

[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.460]
Oh, okay. Well, we owe him an explanation, right?

[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.760]
Right.

[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.780]
What is the explanation?

[00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.840]
Lee's just not here anymore.

[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.140]
This was not his bag.

[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.580]
I got a brain on your bloody side.

[00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.180]
Oh, that was good.

[00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.020]
I like that.

[00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.660]
That was my favorite call of the whole week.

[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.740]
Where's the Greek progresses?

[00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.120]
You notice we're getting some good ones.

[00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.340]
Yeah.

[00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.820]
Okay, no, Lee actually got jealous when David Cohen came in and he asked his where it was.

[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.640]
And he couldn't handle it.

[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.320]
Couldn't handle the pressure.

[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.700]
Okay, let's go to Dave County.

[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.980]
Hello.

[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.920]
Morning, Neil.

[00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.420]
Yes, sir.

[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.020]
How you doing?

[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.420]
Great.

[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.280]
Maybe you can clarify something for me.

[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.220]
That's got through his voice so well.

[00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.000]
You know, it's frightening.

[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.720]
This guy is Dan.

[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.880]
Stan, who?

[00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.780]
And Major.

[00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:20.520]
Oh, yeah.

[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.720]
He keeps talking about this guy Don Johnson.

[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.140]
Who the hell is Don Johnson?

[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.840]
I don't know.

[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.000]
Never heard of him.

[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.640]
Unbelievable.

[00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.220]
Yeah. You can say it again, sir.

[00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.780]
You see the paper this morning?

[00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.940]
What paper?

[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.360]
Um, hell.

[00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.520]
No, I don't read there.

[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.160]
It's right here, but I won't even touch it.

[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.180]
Man, sexual priest is living a living contradiction.

[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.520]
A what?

[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.440]
Man, sexual priest.

[00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.940]
Yeah.

[00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.340]
You turned into a woman now.

[00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.680]
Great.

[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.780]
Well, the Lord works in mysterious ways, sir.

[00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.680]
It's a miracle.

[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.720]
It's a miracle.

[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.180]
See?

[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.280]
Yeah, Jose became Juanita, I think.

[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.040]
Yeah.

[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.280]
Is that it, sir?

[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.200]
Well, could you play that on?

[00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.060]
Oh, here we go.

[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.780]
Let's see.

[00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:06.100]
Yeah.

[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.600]
Now, this is a textbook case for the audience.

[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.300]
It's the pattern.

[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.540]

[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.280]
textbook case.

[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:11.560]
Go ahead.

[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.500]
What is it?

[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.820]
The one of Elvis with addiction.

[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.160]
Everybody wants to be Elvis.

[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:18.680]
Elvis impersonators.

[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.480]
Oh, yeah.

[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.400]
That's in the other room.

[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.460]
You think I'm going to go schlep all the way in the other room to get that?

[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:23.880]
We'll see what happens, sir.

[00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:24.760]
We'll give it a shot.

[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.980]
Okay, 550, 9490.

[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.840]
If you can get through on this ridiculous phone system, 550...

[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.220]
Well, we don't want to belly ache about it too much, but it sucks.

[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.980]
It's the bottom line.

[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.020]
550, 9490.

[00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.820]
And Boka, of course, sitting there very silently.

[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.080]
In fact, there's several of the lines on it, but we probably be a reason for that, right?

[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:43.560]
What could that be?

[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.220]
Well, we don't want to go into that again.

[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.880]
That's not good, carried away.

[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.760]
Okay, 17 past seven, and we'll go back to date County.

[00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:50.180]
Good morning.

[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.900]
Hi.

[00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.780]
Hi, how you doing?

[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:52.420]
Oh, my God.

[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.980]
Good morning.

[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.660]
First time I spoke to you on your new program.

[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:55.780]
Aren't you lucky, huh?

[00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.080]
How are you?

[00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.220]
How's everything good?

[00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.740]
Great.

[00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.000]
We're just so thrilled and here you wouldn't believe it.

[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.100]
It's hard to hear on the phone, you mean?

[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.420]
With you, yeah.

[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.180]
I can't really hear you.

[00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.840]
Well, that's your idea.

[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.920]
Oh, is that it?

[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.640]
Yeah, that way we can throw a few insults, and nobody picks them up.

[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.400]
Let me ask you something.

[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.740]
Yeah.

[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.440]
Is that really Ron Harris and that they gave the news today?

[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.360]
What?

[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.300]
Is that really Ron Harris and that gave the sports earlier?

[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:23.020]
No.

[00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:24.680]
Oh, you mean Mr. Sports?

[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.480]
Well, you know you said Ron Harris said what?

[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.060]
No, Ron was just hanging around in here.

[00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.020]
He had nothing to do.

[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.780]
He sounded terrible on the phone.

[00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.240]
He has scoured the newspaper.

[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.320]
What sounded terrible?

[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.860]
This boy, if it sounded like he had a six-chain.

[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.660]
He did.

[00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:39.380]
Oh, he did.

[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.400]
He had to beg one.

[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.140]
He had to beg one.

[00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.100]
Not anymore, though.

[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.560]
I don't know whether we should go back to the old format, but did you watch it not landing?

[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.160]
Oh, I forgot all about it.

[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.040]
No, I would actually...

[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.260]
Oh, God!

[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.100]
What happened?

[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.140]
I went to bed early because I had all those phone calls.

[00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.640]
Every time I tried to take an apios today, the phone kept ringing.

[00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.360]
Oh!

[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:00.740]
And I went to bed at nine o'clock.

[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.740]
Oh, my God.

[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:02.720]
Well, what happened?

[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.040]
They arrested the Abbey.

[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:04.760]
Really?

[00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.500]
Yeah.

[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:06.740]
And then they finally...

[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.440]
Well, I won't go through the hole.

[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.760]
Oh, here he comes at...

[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.420]
Get his mic off.

[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.060]
Okay, go ahead.

[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.460]
Okay.

[00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:12.040]
Ignore him.

[00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.020]
But they finally decided...

[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.680]
And it was like it was Gary that did.

[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.780]
That he realized that Olivia was...

[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:19.920]
...thought her mother did it.

[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.340]
And that's really Abbey thought.

[00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.200]
Olivia did it.

[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.420]
Yeah.

[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.440]
And...

[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.780]
Well, on that show, everybody does it.

[00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.300]
Huh?

[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.740]
I said on that show, everybody does it.

[00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.420]
But Paige, she's having bad dreams.

[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.380]
And I think, Mac or father is becoming very suspicious of her.

[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:34.780]
Mm-hmm.

[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:35.180]
Yeah.

[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.540]
So, listen, I won't go into the whole detail.

[00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.200]
But make sure you watch it next week.

[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.500]
Wait until next week when the Ville Parmigian twins come knocking at Abbey's door.

[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.520]
That's going to be something.

[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:44.000]
You watch.

[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:45.740]
Good luck on your program.

[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.120]
First time I've listened to it.

[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.740]
Thank you.

[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.240]
Thank you, love.

[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.040]
Have a nice day.

[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.380]
You too.

[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:49.740]
Bye-bye.

[00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:50.980]
Okay, see, that's the first time she's listened.

[00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.240]
So she got a little confused when she heard Mr. Sport.

[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:53.480]
Yeah.

[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.500]
She thought it was Ron Harrison after his sex change.

[00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.700]
And actually, Ron Harrison is Arlene Raw.

[00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:59.640]
She's not aware of that.

[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.240]
After the change.

[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.860]
All this confusion is understandable.

[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:04.460]
Sure.

[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:05.760]
Easy for you to say.

[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.020]
Okay, it's almost 720 and I guess we might as well do it.

[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.100]
And that vocal line is, you know, I just can't relate to that.

[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:13.180]
I can't relate to it.

[00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.500]
I'm going to put like Scotch tape over it so I don't have to look at it.

[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.620]
5509490, it will take loads of calls today.

[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.760]
And, you know, a lot of people have called and said, where is the music?

[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.200]
It's almost 720, I'd say to four.

[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.040]
Rough scene in Miami last night, a four-year-old boy,

[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.600]
apparently thought a loaded 38 caliber revolver was a toy.

[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.540]
Shot and killed his four-year-old sister.

[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:38.940]
This accident occurring when David Dallas and his sister Maggie were at the family-owned Dallas security firm.

[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.340]
Metro-Date Police said the boy picked up the gun.

[00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.260]
Shot his sister in the head.

[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.100]
Maggie Dallas pronounced dead later at a Miami Children's Hospital.

[00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:54.820]
After spending more than two hours yesterday, before a grand jury investigating the famous suitcase,

[00:07:54.820 --> 00:08:01.460]
Dave County manager Sergio Pereira says he feels victimized by the man who sold him stolen goods,

[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:05.100]
because Pereira said he bought them in good faith.

[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.260]
NFL strike has ended.

[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.260]
However, it appears replacement players will again be used in this weekend's games.

[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.400]
And once again, the USS become a target in the Persian Gulf.

[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.780]
No indication yet how it will respond to today's attack.

[00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.440]
This time, the target, a U.S. flag, Kuwaiti tanker.

[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.900]
And we have an accident northbound on I-95 this morning.

[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:31.840]
This is near the 69th Street exit ramp, and that is backing up traffic to 112.

[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:32.560]
Ruff area?

[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:33.180]
Yeah.

[00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:34.040]
You don't want to.

[00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:35.680]
You like to avoid that area.

[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:36.400]
At all times.

[00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.200]
Zeta forecast partly sunny and breezy today.

[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.060]
High will be about 85 and low tonight about 75.

[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.960]
The good news is we have just a slight chance of rain now, and that's going to hold through the weekend.

[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.700]
It's 71 degrees.

[00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.820]
It's 721 and a half on Zeta 4.

[00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:53.820]
And I'm Glenn Hill.

[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:58.480]

[00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:57.040]
I wear it everywhere when I go round to other AZAs.

[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.900]
They don't go up to say.

[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.140]
So be true to your show.

[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:07.800]
Be true to your show.

[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:30.860]
Les, let it come

[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:30.860]

[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:31.020]
Don't take anyte

[00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:31.020]

[00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:31.020]

[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:43.120]
Now Neil Rogers continues to shoot the breeze on WIMZ.

[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:43.800]
On what station?

[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.220]
It's called 6249.

[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:45.560]
Do you hear that?

[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:45.960]
100?

[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.400]
In Rowered 5249400, don't bottle it up inside.

[00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:52.720]
Let it all out with Neil Rogers.

[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:54.860]
Do you believe she said that?

[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:55.720]
She said that.

[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.000]
Didn't she say Zeta Ford?

[00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:57.340]
Yeah.

[00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:58.740]
That's what I heard.

[00:11:59.000 --> 00:11:59.160]
Yeah.

[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.720]
I thought she said Zeta Ford didn't she?

[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:00.940]
Yeah.

[00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:02.260]
WZTA.

[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.520]
I thought it was something like that.

[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.100]
There was a Z in there somewhere.

[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:08.920]
I think I'm going to keep playing it.

[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:09.400]
I like that.

[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.440]
26 past 7 on Zeta Ford, the Neil Rogers show of Friday morning.

[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:14.380]
And don't get hypernil.

[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.280]
Just everybody relax.

[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.580]
The daylight is breaking out there.

[00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:18.140]
Isn't that beautiful?

[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:18.800]
Look at that.

[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.120]
There's Rick Edwards running around in circles over near the towers.

[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:22.840]
Fantastic.

[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.600]
OK, let's take some of the calls here because they're lit up like a Hanukkah bush.

[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.140]
Rowered County.

[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:28.620]
Good morning.

[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.320]
This is good morning to you in the bird.

[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:31.500]
Yes, and how are you?

[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.240]
I'm just fine.

[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:32.720]
How are you?

[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:33.460]
You sound fine.

[00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:34.100]
We're fine.

[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.980]
I'm very glad that we're all fine.

[00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:36.860]
Everybody's fine.

[00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:38.060]
Isn't that fine?

[00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:38.980]
Yeah.

[00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:42.300]
Yes, I have a question of the sports guy.

[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.380]
Yeah, Mr. sports.

[00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.760]
Yeah, it sounds a lot to me like Brian Norcross on that.

[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.560]
Well, I didn't want to let it out of the bag, but he is a distant cousin, a kissing cousin.

[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:54.720]
I can tell.

[00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:56.380]
Yeah, I bet you good.

[00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:57.700]
You're a real funky guy.

[00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:58.080]
Yeah.

[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.560]
I had a radio accident this morning, my first ever.

[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:02.100]
Really?

[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.640]
What did you stumble upon?

[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.980]
Well, I was trying to fix breakfast and tune you in at the same time.

[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.960]
And my husband told me to hurry up and I got close to it.

[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.140]
It's a good time and I had a quick tune over.

[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:13.540]
Hmm.

[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.440]
Boy, that's not just an accident.

[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:16.060]
It's frightening.

[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.180]
That's like a major disaster.

[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.560]
That would be like a headline story.

[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:22.360]
It's a good time.

[00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:24.980]
I know my husband's got to fix his own breakfast.

[00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.860]
And the boy is going to have accidents like that.

[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.140]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:28.680]
Only fair.

[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.380]
Yeah, it's amazing.

[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:35.260]
I went to the melting pot and I had a wonderful time back so much.

[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:39.080]
So now my husband wants me to go up and get pot to chocolate to go at night.

[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:40.820]
Yeah, I don't blame her.

[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.000]
Did you get the white chocolate or the dark?

[00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:44.140]
No, we got the dark.

[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:45.640]
I got to try the white the next time.

[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.460]
Oh, trust me.

[00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:51.040]
I mean, the dark is great, but the white chocolate with the amaretto is so good that you'll forget your husband.

[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.060]
You'll just kick him out.

[00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:52.860]
That's great.

[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.620]
Just take the chocolate home.

[00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.020]
OK, well, I really enjoyed it.

[00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.680]
And I thought Jamie bounding after you that night, you were up there.

[00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.360]
I thought you lost your wallet or something.

[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:02.760]
He's really frantic.

[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.280]
Yeah, he came flying out of there like a maniac.

[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:06.180]
I saw that.

[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:07.400]
I was just acting natural.

[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.540]
You know, like a maniac.

[00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.560]
I thought he worked there and you forgot your wallet or something.

[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.280]
You're all important.

[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:14.140]
That'll be my luck.

[00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.240]
Probably he'll be working here next week.

[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.380]
I'll go over there instead of getting Dave to wait on me.

[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:19.820]
Well, why don't you put Jamie as the way to?

[00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:25.460]
It'll be the first fondue, Ville Parmesan, a history of mankind.

[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.320]
Well, you have a wonderful weekend.

[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:28.980]
You too.

[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.340]
For the first time in a while.

[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.020]
OK, yeah, isn't this exciting?

[00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:33.460]
It's just great.

[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.960]
Now they don't have to listen to me bitch about working on Saturday anymore because I won't be here.

[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:41.840]
And I like it when we have our choices, records to play and not to play because you calm up on the FM.

[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:42.800]
They won't play in any way.

[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:43.380]
So it's a different.

[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.260]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.860]
They got their playlist and they pretend that they're playing something you wanted to hear.

[00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.620]
But if it wasn't on a list, they won't play it anyway.

[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.280]
Yeah, they just say it to pass the player.

[00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:52.060]
You got it.

[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:52.480]
OK.

[00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:53.420]
Have a nice one.

[00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:53.780]
You too.

[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:55.180]
She's so right.

[00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.300]
What's the difference anyway?

[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.760]
Yeah, they're not going to play what you want.

[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:58.160]
Yeah.

[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:02.220]
And if you happen to call in and request something that's on the list, then they record it and they put it on here.

[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:02.880]
Oh, look at this.

[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:03.640]
Are we being nice?

[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.900]
We're playing what you wanted to hear.

[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.580]
Is it complete blind?

[00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:07.240]
Don't look.

[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:14.040]
And if it wasn't on a playlist, man, those consultants would drag them screaming and kicking out of there so fast, you wouldn't believe it.

[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.980]
It's 7.30 right on the nose here on Zeta Ford.

[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:18.520]
This show is flying this morning.

[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:19.860]
Isn't it like a big bird?

[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.180]
Just flying along.

[00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:24.260]
Let's go to Broward County.

[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:24.680]
Good morning.

[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:25.920]
I hate it now.

[00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:26.120]
Good.

[00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.900]
How much seems to me?

[00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:30.980]
You got rid of those car phone idiots you used to get?

[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.980]
Yeah, the mobile caller seemed to like have disappeared.

[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:34.280]
Yeah.

[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:34.980]
You know why?

[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.500]
Well, first thing in the morning now.

[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.700]
Yeah, well, they're cheap skates too.

[00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.200]
You know, it costs 35 cents a minute starting from the ring.

[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.280]
And you know, very often we let them just keep ringing.

[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.580]
So they're not going to call their cheap.

[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:45.740]
We're calling them.

[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.360]
They're cheap soothes.

[00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.120]
Yeah, hey, that is a good idea.

[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:53.900]
Maybe we could get people to write in to write in with their mobile phone numbers.

[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.140]
I can call them.

[00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:56.700]
Yeah, and we could call them in the morning.

[00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:59.420]
And then what we really will do will call them when they're not in the car.

[00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:05.880]
When they got the car like parked and they run in somewhere and will let a ring and ring for like, because you get charged when somebody calls you.

[00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:06.140]
Right.

[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.160]
They'll start running out of wherever they are to run to the answer.

[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.360]
Do they get charged the same?

[00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:11.860]
Yeah.

[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:12.380]
We call them.

[00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:12.900]
Absolutely.

[00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:14.020]
Oh, yeah.

[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:15.480]
Well, that's that's power.

[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:16.880]
So whatever you do, don't give out my number.

[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.900]
No, I haven't given it to anybody yet.

[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:19.240]
I know.

[00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:20.400]
Which is just the way I like it.

[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:21.960]
Real common peaceful in the car.

[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:23.880]
The purpose of the phone.

[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:24.460]
Yeah.

[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.440]
Well, in case you need it, you know, good question.

[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:29.640]
Thank you.

[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:30.520]
It's doing great now.

[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:31.880]
Yeah, we're cooking there.

[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.560]
I think yesterday we finally crossed the path.

[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:35.780]
You know what I mean?

[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:36.640]
Yeah.

[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:37.920]
I don't.

[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.340]
No, I think like yesterday we finally got our act together.

[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:40.940]
And, huh?

[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.020]
Oh, I lied.

[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:42.500]
Yeah.

[00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.420]
Well, listen, what did you want to hear, sir?

[00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:48.020]
Oh, do you think I'm not around?

[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.220]
No, I'm just pulling your leg, pulling your leg.

[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.020]
Are you going to work?

[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:53.600]
Not today.

[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:54.940]
Lucky, man.

[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:55.700]
Oh, not today.

[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:56.760]
Any special reason?

[00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.300]
Um, no.

[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:02.340]
No, just, he just, in other words, do you work?

[00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:03.340]
Yeah.

[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:04.960]
Yeah, you work, but you're not going today.

[00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:08.260]
And it sounds like there's something a little devious here that you don't want us to probe

[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:08.720]
and we're going to go into the window, right?

[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:11.240]
Okay.

[00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:12.900]
Oh, this is good.

[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:13.460]
I like this.

[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.800]
I think we've touched a raw nerve on this called, now listen, we don't want to pry.

[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:18.760]
I don't want to get you in hot water.

[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:20.240]
Where do you work?

[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:20.780]

[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:23.660]
Okay, listen, enjoy your day.

[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:23.980]
What are you doing?

[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:24.860]
Going out to Calder today?

[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:26.580]
No, I don't know.

[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:29.320]
Going out to the Broward Mall of Tend to troll?

[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:30.760]
Yeah.

[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:32.460]
Well, good luck to you, sir.

[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:33.640]
Okay, then.

[00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:34.900]
And tell Stan, I said hi.

[00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:35.780]
Okay.

[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.400]
Okay, he'll be over there at the mall with you.

[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:37.820]
I'm sure.

[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:42.340]
It's 732, Mr. Sports is in the other room, gargling and getting ready to do his thing.

[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:45.000]
And in the meantime, let's go back to the date County.

[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:45.340]
Hello.

[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:46.560]
Good morning, Neil.

[00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:47.460]
Yes, Walter.

[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.700]
Hi, you're doing it, Walter.

[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:49.920]
You stupid old fart.

[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:50.540]
How are you?

[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.800]
Hi, I want to talk to Grant about his news cow.

[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:53.760]
Okay, Walter.

[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:54.560]
Here we go.

[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.180]
Oh, Grant, we have a problem here in New York.

[00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:01.340]
The grand jury was investigating the famous suitcase.

[00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:03.840]
What the hell is the famous suitcase?

[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.580]
I also said that a rat was an ally of Kuwaiti.

[00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.320]
There's no such country as Kuwaiti.

[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.580]
Honey, there is it.

[00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:14.980]
No, try Kuwait.

[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.180]
Oh, Kuwaiti.

[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:16.680]
Kuwaiti.

[00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:17.160]
That's right.

[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.040]
Thank you, Walter.

[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.180]
That's the way it is.

[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.180]
Good morning.

[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:21.400]
733.

[00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:23.780]
Okay, my senior, I, a little friend, have a wonderful weekend.

[00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:24.660]
You too, Neil.

[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:24.980]
Good on you.

[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:25.200]
Thank you.

[00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:28.060]
And Adios and Dan Rather sends his best to you.

[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:30.740]
733 on Zeta 4.

[00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.120]
And we're going back to date County again.

[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:33.640]
Good morning.

[00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:34.820]
Hello.

[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:35.780]
Hello.

[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:36.820]
Mobile.

[00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:37.900]
Mobile.

[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.400]
What is it?

[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:40.680]
Mobile.

[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:41.380]
What do you mean what?

[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:42.520]
I got on the air?

[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:43.700]
Yeah, you're on the air, sir.

[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:44.520]
Isn't that what you wanted?

[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:45.380]
Unbelievable.

[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:46.520]
I know.

[00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:49.280]
I heard you racking on all the mobile callers.

[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.740]
Yeah, a bunch of suits, but you might be an exception, sir.

[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:52.940]
We'll give you the benefit of the doubt.

[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.420]
Okay, first of all.

[00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.420]
Although, you know, start paying from the rain.

[00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:58.680]
When you start paying?

[00:18:58.960 --> 00:18:59.820]
Until it's picked up.

[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:00.380]
Oh, really?

[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:01.220]
I didn't know that.

[00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.080]
We heard the other.

[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:02.760]
Yeah.

[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:06.100]
Secondly, I really wanted to hit your number, but you're not going to give it out, huh?

[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:06.800]
Oh, yeah, you're right.

[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.000]
I'm going to give it on the air, sir.

[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:08.700]
Yeah.

[00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:09.920]
My idea.

[00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:11.120]
Yeah, brilliant idea.

[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.600]
Where is Biff today?

[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.520]
Biff is no longer with the show.

[00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.780]
Biff is, he'd be doing some other stuff, I guess.

[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:18.080]
Oh, that's too bad.

[00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:18.480]
Yeah.

[00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:20.680]
I just wanted to ask you a question.

[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:25.440]
You remember the old Ford Lauderdale soccer team?

[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:25.960]
Oh, yeah.

[00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:26.700]
The strikers.

[00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:27.560]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.840]
They have any connection with Jeff?

[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:31.360]
As a matter of fact, yes.

[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.840]
The team was named in his honor, but...

[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:33.680]
Yeah.

[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:39.280]
Mayor Cox did not like the connotation, and as a result, its adios are even there.

[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:41.000]
I've got some all bumper stickers.

[00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.040]
I think I can say just something.

[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:43.280]
They say striker-likeer.

[00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:45.500]
Oh, those would be great.

[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.100]
They have to read it carefully.

[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.820]
Not spelled right, but they would be great.

[00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:49.960]
Yeah, you have to read it carefully.

[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.020]
You don't want to give them any trouble.

[00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:54.920]
Well, Peter Boulder, our program director, is a little confused about all this Jeff

[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:55.560]
striker stuff.

[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:56.860]
He hasn't figured it out.

[00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:00.400]
So I guess we're going to have to paste some of our pictures up on his door today to, you know,

[00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:02.400]
lead him in the right direction.

[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.020]
Like I keep telling people, you have to listen for a while.

[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:05.960]
You'll catch on to everything.

[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.060]
Yeah, it's like a soap opera.

[00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:10.420]
I said, Peter, I don't have time to go back to the beginning and explain it all to you, you know?

[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.940]
But hang in there and a little, little, little, all makes sense.

[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:13.560]
We're hanging.

[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.380]
So let me ask you another question.

[00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:16.560]
Yes, sir, very quickly.

[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:21.240]
I saw you on TV, you know, when one hand was doing your thing a couple of weeks ago or a week ago.

[00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:21.640]
Yes.

[00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:23.820]
And you had hair and everything.

[00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:24.340]
Yeah.

[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.180]
Isn't that amazing?

[00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.180]
Yeah, but I remember back to the tropics.

[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.760]
And Harold, you had the bald Gene Wyngardt instead of was bald.

[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.100]
Yeah, where are you way back then?

[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.020]
Well, I don't remember.

[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:37.260]
I don't remember being bald, but it may have been, you know, on the TV.

[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:37.860]
I know.

[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:41.180]
It's just, it didn't like ship with the old tropics thing.

[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:41.540]
Right.

[00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:42.660]
Well, I'll work on it.

[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:43.080]
Okay.

[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:43.620]
Adios.

[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:44.180]
Talk.

[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:49.000]
Okay, not a bad caller from Mobile Phone Caller, you know, 735 on Zeta 4.

[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:51.780]
Good morning, everybody.

[00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:55.880]
In the National Hockey League last night, the Islander shut out Philadelphia 6-0 in overtime.

[00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.020]
The Rangers and Pittsburgh played away 6-all tie.

[00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:00.500]
And the Boston Bruins beat Los Angeles 3-2.

[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:04.700]
Although the National Football League players ended their strike, one union leader says it's not a surrender,

[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:06.260]
turning the move AC's fire.

[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.540]
Unable to negotiate a contract settlement, the union is taking the owners to court.

[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:15.500]
The owners say the back-to-work order by union leader Gene Upshot came too late to avoid a third straight weekend of SCAB games.

[00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:19.080]
Whitey Herzog's pitching choice for the opening game of the World Series is a surprise.

[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:25.420]
He's picked rookie left-hander Joe McGray and over veteran Bob Forsch to pitch against Minnesota's Frank Viola in the first game of the Series Saturday night.

[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:32.540]
Cardinals also learned that third-baseman Terry Pendleton will probably be lost for the series because of a ribcage injury suffered in the last game of the playoffs.

[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:38.300]
Mike Tyson defenses heavyweight crown in Atlantic City, New Jersey tonight against 1984 Olympic gold medalist Tyrell Biggs.

[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.920]
Tyson and I know one favorite is unbeaten in 31 fights with 27 knockouts.

[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.460]
Biggs is 15 and 0 with 10 knockouts and that's sports.

[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:49.040]
22 to 8, 738 in Espanol.

[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.960]
It's Ciepe, he trained the Ocho.

[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:52.680]
Thank you.

[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.900]
Or whatever. That's not how they do the time.

[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.080]
Ocho Maynose, 20-dose.

[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.280]
So Dave says...

[00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:58.520]
Is that right?

[00:21:58.980 --> 00:21:59.980]
Ocho Maynose, 20-dose?

[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:01.660]
22 before 8?

[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:02.940]
Well, we know.

[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:04.920]
Oh, come on.

[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.920]
Can you cut me a break, Stan would say.

[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:08.520]
Do you know anybody who says that?

[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.360]
Yeah, only Stan.

[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:13.920]
Cut me a break, that's like one of those tragic ancient lines.

[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:14.980]
It did, yeah.

[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:16.680]
Like Stan by me.

[00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:21.920]
Anyway, this hour, now we got to play the roaches for that nice lady.

[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.580]
She really, remember she called back yesterday?

[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:24.000]
Yeah.

[00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:25.820]
And she said she's with us for life.

[00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.040]
And you said it's good.

[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.540]
And after we played Meried Men by the Roaches, which is cute.

[00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:31.860]
You know, it's, we're going to play it sometime.

[00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.120]
Maybe if not this hour, next hour for sure.

[00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:35.800]
Because she said she listens from 7 to 10.

[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:36.480]
Okay.

[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.880]
And I don't want to disappoint her.

[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:39.800]
It's here, it's like right in the thing there.

[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:40.640]
Yeah, light tone.

[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:44.160]
And also this hour got stepping up and we are going to play it, right?

[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:46.680]
Oh, absolutely.

[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:48.500]
Come on, that's the greatest.

[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:50.040]
Okay, bokeh, good morning.

[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.140]
Yeah, Buenos dias.

[00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:52.460]
Buenos dias to you too, sir.

[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:54.520]
This show sounds great to hear, really does.

[00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:57.320]
I know, that's because we're loosened, all that other good stuff.

[00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:58.000]
Releuze.

[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.020]
I get a phone, the phone sounds fine.

[00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:01.360]
People have a car playing about how they can't hear one on the phone.

[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:02.700]
It sounds just as it did before.

[00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:03.500]
What do you mean?

[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:04.420]
On the speaker phone?

[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:06.260]
On the telephone here.

[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:08.360]
Nobody, in other words, when you're talking to us, you mean?

[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:08.920]
Yeah.

[00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:12.100]
Doesn't sound bad, I think they expected to be in stereo on their phone.

[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:16.360]
Well, see, the problem is, like on the AM, we had this other system when we didn't use the speaker phone.

[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:20.820]
We used a different system and all the microphones are wired directly into it.

[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.280]
So it sounds like a regular phone call.

[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.660]
I can't as opposed to this, which sounds like we're in a barrel.

[00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:25.740]
Yeah, sounds like a speaker phone.

[00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:26.060]
It's not bad.

[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.760]
But the interesting thing of it is we are in a barrel, that's the good part.

[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:30.080]
It's real good.

[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:30.160]

[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.000]
We're going to play with our Leechless, there's not Whitty guys anymore, right?

[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.860]
No, Lee is moving on to other things.

[00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:34.940]
I think it's probably the best.

[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:38.200]
I think you get to make people in the room there, just kind of let's it all up.

[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:44.160]
But I think for his, for his demise, you ought to play the James Brown, the Soul Patrol, and the Keyhole thing for him.

[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:44.880]
That might be a...

[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.360]
Oh yeah, James Brown's security alarm.

[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:47.320]
It's probably possible.

[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:51.840]
On the telephone, the sports guy does sound like Brian Dorkrot.

[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:52.280]
Yeah.

[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:53.860]
Well, what can I say?

[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.320]
The weather here is beautiful.

[00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:58.920]
He's like your Tony Cigreto, I guess, in the morning.

[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.340]
He comes in and does the sports for you, right?

[00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:03.120]
Yeah, a little more upbeat than Tony, but he's good.

[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:09.340]
Listen, there are a couple things that the bit about the six-year-old Neil Rogers, that's going to be a classic.

[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:09.480]
Yeah.

[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:10.920]
I think that's the one where he had it just been.

[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:11.760]
Yeah, from Geneva.

[00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:12.620]
I didn't know they had that.

[00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:15.160]
I would have been trying to hide that, but they dug it out.

[00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:16.380]
That's one more thing.

[00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:17.340]
I hate to ask for a question.

[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:22.280]
But my girlfriend doesn't believe, you play the Joey Reynolds Gong thing all the time.

[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:25.360]
But one day, it was last week, you played...

[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.960]
I think you just played it once, was a Neil Rogers thing.

[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:29.120]
It was on the same song.

[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:30.420]
Oh yeah.

[00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:31.420]
It was hilarious.

[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:33.480]
I just laughed out in the car.

[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:34.580]
I was like, it was fine.

[00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:35.520]
Well, I'll be honest with you.

[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:36.120]
It's in the machine.

[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:37.140]
Right as you speak.

[00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:37.620]
Fantastic.

[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:38.480]
You guys are doing great.

[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.960]
Neil have a great weekend.

[00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:41.480]
I'm sure you're looking for that two-day...

[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.600]
You have no idea.

[00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:43.900]
Appreciate the car.

[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:44.520]
Thanks a lot.

[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:46.040]
Okay, we'll call you again.

[00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:49.740]
Neil Rogers.

[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.200]
Neil Rogers.

[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:54.920]
Neil Rogers.

[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:55.120]
Neil Rogers.

[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:55.380]
Neil Williams.

[00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:56.600]
Neil Rogers.

[00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:57.420]
Neil Rogers.

[00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:58.140]
Neil Rogers.

[00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:04.420]
Neil Rogers.

[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:05.700]
Neil Rogers.

[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.360]
Neil Rogers.

[00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:07.420]

[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:09.040]
Neil Rogers.

[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:17.340]
collaborating with Hill Johricht flavour.

[00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:18.020]

[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:21.740]
Neil Rogers.

[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:21.760]

[00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:24.880]
Neil Rogers.

[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:24.980]
Neil Rogers.

[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:24.980]

[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:24.980]

[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:24.980]

[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:24.980]

[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:24.980]

[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:24.980]

[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:24.980]

[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:24.980]

[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:25.180]
Neil Rogers.

[00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:25.180]

[00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:25.180]

[00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:25.300]
Neil Rogers.

[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:26.600]
Neil Rogers.

[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:30.840]
I'm just gonna show you a

[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.280]
right and show.

[00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:36.980]
There we go.

[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:37.980]
One, two, three.

[00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:39.400]
Just lost me.

[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.840]
I'm just gonna switch to

[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.760]
I can see you.

[00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:45.520]
I can't wait until

[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:46.660]
you're done flying.

[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.340]
I'm gonna fly to

[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:51.340]
you.

[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.420]
I'm just gonna fly to you.

[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:04.420]

[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:04.420]

[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:04.420]

[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:04.480]
I'm just gonna fly to you.

[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:08.520]
I'm just gonna fly to you.

[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.060]
Okay, Joy, never get anything like that, did he?

[00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:13.520]
And you see, the reason I haven't played that is because it

[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:14.780]
makes references to the AM.

[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:16.080]
And I'm trying to avoid that.

[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:17.780]
But as I've listened to this stuff,

[00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:18.640]
it doesn't make any difference.

[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.160]
It doesn't matter.

[00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:22.060]
It still has the same flavor.

[00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:24.740]
17 before 8 at Zeta 4 and our next caller

[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.360]
has probably been waiting for a lifetime in

[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:26.800]
Dade County.

[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:27.120]
Hello.

[00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:28.000]
Hello, Neil.

[00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:28.620]

[00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:30.060]
As the first morning I've had

[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:33.080]
offset you've made this change to Zeta 4 and I must say

[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:36.080]
the story of making sound more mellow like a nice guy.

[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:36.480]
Right.

[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.620]
You're coming off real more mellow.

[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:39.660]
Like a miracle, right?

[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:42.780]
Yeah, I just wanted to ask you are more young people

[00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:46.240]
tuning you in because I work in North Campus in Miami

[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:48.740]
Dade and they seem to be telling me everything you say.

[00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:49.180]
Oh, yeah.

[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.320]
You must be getting more younger group here.

[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.620]
Yeah, everybody with an IQ of over six under the age of 35

[00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:55.200]
in this market.

[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.020]
Listen to this show.

[00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.860]
But I'm really telling you it's something interesting to hear

[00:26:58.860 --> 00:26:59.660]
the campus.

[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:03.300]
They are actually discussing neo-rodgers instead of power 96.

[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:03.740]
Now what?

[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.580]
We are making progress at the campus.

[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:06.960]
What campus is this?

[00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:09.080]
Fourth campus, Miami-Dade College.

[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:09.640]
Miami-Dade.

[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:11.700]
I wonder what Dave Cohen, which campus he goes to.

[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:12.860]
Did he say goes to Miami-Dade?

[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:14.420]
That's at 113.

[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:15.400]
Oh, yeah.

[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:16.880]
Bet you that's where he is right now.

[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:17.700]
I hope so.

[00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:19.680]
But listen, neo-keep up with the good work.

[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:20.360]
Thank you.

[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:20.840]
Bye-bye.

[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:21.480]
Have a nice day.

[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.260]
Everybody in the listening audience, keep your hands off our

[00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:24.680]
property.

[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:25.040]
Okay?

[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:26.460]
He's a good guy.

[00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.360]
He has a good sense of humor and he came in and spent a little

[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.860]
time on the show and leaves lap yesterday, which is why Lee is not

[00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:31.640]
here today anymore.

[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.340]
You know, these FM people, man, they're uptighted and unfriendly.

[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:35.740]
You know what I mean?

[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:36.640]
Like me at the track.

[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.800]
They are uptight and unfriendly.

[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.360]
Speaking of the carpeting crew, here they come ladies and gentlemen.

[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:42.540]
Isn't that them?

[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:44.140]
Looks like they're there.

[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.640]
I would recognize that raft anywhere, wouldn't you?

[00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:46.900]
Yeah, right.

[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.120]
The license plate's hanging off the back.

[00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:51.100]
Oh, boy.

[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:53.760]
That's part of the crew, although I didn't see somebody in that truck.

[00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.880]
So if I start getting nervous a little while, I may not continue.

[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.200]
The show may not be able to continue.

[00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:00.100]
Well, you must confess now.

[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:03.860]
I mean, I feel more comfortable because Lee was getting very upset and

[00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:04.740]
uptighted and unfriendly.

[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.380]
But you got to admit, now this was an extraordinary young man we had in here

[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:09.220]
the other day, wasn't he?

[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.100]
If you say so.

[00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:12.840]
I mean, even Stan admitted to me that he was an extraordinary young man.

[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.960]
Of course, Stan, we don't know what the hell is going on now.

[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:16.460]
We're not really sure.

[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:18.140]
And look at that.

[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.020]
Look like Don Johnson getting out of the truck, too.

[00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:21.000]
That looks just like that.

[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:21.620]
That's not.

[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:22.000]
Isn't it?

[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:22.340]
Okay.

[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:22.600]
Okay.

[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:27.860]
ABC and CBS and AP and UPI get him in here immediately if not sooner.

[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:31.340]
550, 9490 is our number.

[00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:33.300]
If you like to, then that's toll free for anybody.

[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:35.780]
Anybody who can hear us, 550, 9490.

[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:39.440]
And if you get some kind of a recording, that means you shouldn't be calling us in a first place.

[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:39.800]
Correct.

[00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:40.320]
Okay.

[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.620]
Line 2 is next in Dade County.

[00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:42.960]
Hello.

[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:43.640]
Good morning.

[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:44.180]
How are you?

[00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:44.460]
Great.

[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.700]
And I make a suggestion regarding the music.

[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:47.300]
Of course.

[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:48.220]
Anything you like.

[00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:48.740]
Okay.

[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.840]
I noticed that during the past week you conspicuously left out America's greatest rocket roll band.

[00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:57.320]
Any guesses?

[00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:01.160]
Neil, this is one of your favorite groups.

[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:03.220]
I'm waiting.

[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:04.340]
Each boy.

[00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:05.560]
No, we haven't.

[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.020]
Didn't we play Sloop John B the other day?

[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:07.660]
No.

[00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:08.840]
We left it out.

[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:09.740]
I think we left it out.

[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:10.660]
We were going to play it.

[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:11.440]
We didn't have time.

[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:11.800]
Okay.

[00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:14.580]
Either good vibration to surf or grow would probably be in order.

[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:15.000]
Okay.

[00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:15.740]
Okay.

[00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:17.060]
The second thing is this.

[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:20.060]
Did Carlos ever do it?

[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:21.920]
Carlos, the label maker.

[00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.680]
You kept warning him not to do it.

[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:24.240]
Did he ever?

[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:25.180]
Carlos.

[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.860]
No, we haven't heard from Carlos.

[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.220]
I would want to speak for him.

[00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:28.840]
Left hand.

[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:28.920]

[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:29.440]
And left hand.

[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:30.240]
And they're car commercial.

[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:30.840]
Yeah.

[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.440]
That gentleman certainly keeps his level up, doesn't he?

[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:34.180]
Yeah.

[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:34.780]
He sure does.

[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:35.940]
Okay.

[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:37.800]
I want to let you know I'm enjoying it.

[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:38.300]
Thank you.

[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.160]
Have a nice weekend.

[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:40.120]
Okay.

[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:41.780]
Five billion dollars.

[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.820]
Fourteen before eight here on Zeta 4 and look at this.

[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:47.920]
They're starting to roll in.

[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:48.680]
Who the hell is that?

[00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:49.220]
Look at that.

[00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:50.740]
That's a program director.

[00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:51.620]
Oh, that's a program director.

[00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:54.280]
Like I said, look at that wonderful man who just drove in here.

[00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:55.660]
Look at him with a smile on his face.

[00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:57.440]
And he's taking little notes.

[00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:58.600]
He's writing down the time.

[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:02.440]
You ripped me at 746 and you ripped me at 12 past seven.

[00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:03.620]
See, it's a good thing about him.

[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:05.320]
He's only got an AM radio in there anyway.

[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.140]
So don't worry about it.

[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:07.960]
Say they can't look at it.

[00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:09.040]
He can't get out of the car.

[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:12.320]
As long as we keep talking about him, he will not leave the car.

[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:12.980]
Do I blame him?

[00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:15.720]
Well, if I look like that, I'd never get out of the car either.

[00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:16.540]
Just a joke.

[00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:18.120]
Pete, just a joke.

[00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:18.780]
Did he get out?

[00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:19.280]
No.

[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:23.120]
He's not going to get out.

[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:24.040]
He's still in there.

[00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:24.820]
He's taking little note.

[00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:27.280]
What he's putting together his dream team for Linda Thornton.

[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.860]
And by now, I would think Linda would be up, wouldn't she?

[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:30.480]
Yeah.

[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.120]
Linda, OK, so you woke me up two days in a row.

[00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:33.720]
No problem.

[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:34.420]
I don't feel bad.

[00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.080]
You have no way of knowing when I'm taking an app.

[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:37.860]
But that's not what bothers me.

[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.480]
What bothers me is you don't understand.

[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:40.700]
It's a dumb question.

[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.540]
Nobody cares about your question about the dream lineup.

[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:47.800]
You know, they all want to be program directors, but they don't have dream line-ups.

[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:48.160]
No.

[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.220]
They have some nightmares, but no dreams.

[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:51.540]
By the way, look at that.

[00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:52.480]
The sun is shining.

[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:53.400]
The sky is blue.

[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.880]
And Peter is still in the car.

[00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:56.200]
He still won't get out of the car.

[00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.440]
OK, won't get out till we take another call so we better do it.

[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:01.560]
Who is that?

[00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:04.240]
Oh, this is our first time tunnel.

[00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:05.240]
Oh, this is our first time tunnel.

[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:07.920]
Oh, this is our first time tunnel.

[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:11.220]
On the F-band, this is our first time tunnel on Z-4.

[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:12.360]
How does it sound in stereo?

[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.220]
One, two, three.

[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:15.100]
That's it.

[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:16.200]
That's it.

[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:17.560]
That's it.

[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:18.400]
That's it.

[00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:21.360]
OK, little two, Harry, to leave that on forever, right?

[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:22.260]
But I liked it.

[00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:23.980]
Yeah, the stereo time tunnel.

[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.080]
You won't hear that.

[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:26.260]
Enjoy 107.

[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:27.620]
I'll tell you that, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:28.660]
No chance.

[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:30.380]
No changes.

[00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:31.560]
Broward, hello.

[00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:34.340]
Hi, is this the lead Gillette and friend show?

[00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:34.860]
Yeah.

[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:35.840]
How you doing?

[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:37.100]
Is Neil Roger there?

[00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:39.020]
No, he is not on the show anymore, sir.

[00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:40.420]
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:41.500]
Could you give him a message, please?

[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:41.920]
OK.

[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.580]
Neil, this is Joe Nichols.

[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:47.100]
It's a good time for a great motivational tape.

[00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:51.420]
By the way, they haven't still haven't been able to motivate anybody to listen to that station.

[00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:51.840]
Have you noticed?

[00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:54.080]
Well, I did notice that, unfortunately.

[00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:55.440]
But our ratings are getting better.

[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:55.920]
Yeah.

[00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:57.680]
What is it about a point two now?

[00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.260]
Well, pretty close.

[00:31:59.460 --> 00:31:59.680]
Pretty close.

[00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:01.380]
We're feeling really good about that.

[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.720]
I'm listening to a tape in my other ear right now.

[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:04.660]
I'm feeling really good.

[00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:09.740]
That's really incredible, especially since the Neil Rogers factor is no longer on the AM dial, right?

[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.200]
Thank God for that.

[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:12.360]
Yeah, you can say that again.

[00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:13.500]
Thank God for that.

[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.200]
They get up to a point three.

[00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:18.680]
OK, well, good luck to you, sir.

[00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:23.900]
OK, and we have a motivational change for your I-95 song.

[00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:24.560]
Yes, sir.

[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:26.660]
Would you change the word to Apple?

[00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:29.460]
It's healthy for you, and you'll feel much better.

[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:33.240]
OK.

[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:35.420]
He sounds almost as good as Bruce Williams.

[00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:35.940]

[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.240]
Sure take care of that, boy.

[00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:40.400]
It's 11 before 8 here on Zeta 4.

[00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:44.620]
The news is coming up almost almost instantaneously as we speak.

[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:45.140]
Oh, leave it.

[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:51.400]
And we'll hear about that wonderful country of Kuwaiti, where they were their espesto's shoes.

[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:53.160]
Is he still in the car?

[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:53.880]
I do bet.

[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.700]
What the hell is he doing in the car?

[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:56.740]
I think he's going to be there at 10.

[00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:57.620]
Look at that.

[00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:58.780]
He's smoking the steering wheel.

[00:32:58.780 --> 00:32:59.660]
I can't believe it.

[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.600]
It's not that bad.

[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:03.080]
You know, don't follow parties coming apart of the pieces.

[00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:04.420]
Look at that.

[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:08.560]
Do you remember a rear window where he had the suitcase and the trunk?

[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:09.020]
Right.

[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:13.480]
And I don't know if one of the consultancies in there, but boy, it sure looks familiar.

[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:17.040]
All right, it's 7.50 now on Zeta 4.

[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:23.140]
I just worried this morning from Midland, Texas, since rescuers are getting closer to pulling that 18 month old toddler.

[00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:30.360]
Out of the abandoned well, officials say the rescuers tumbling through rocks so hard that it dulled diamond-tipped drills.

[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:37.060]
Today broke a two inch hole in the well shaft where the youngsters trapped 22 feet below ground.

[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:46.140]
The Pentagon hints it knows but won't yet release the source of today's attack on a U.S. flag Kuwaiti tanker in the pulse Persian Gulf.

[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:51.380]
But a spokesman says there are reports that an aircraft was in the area of the attack at the time.

[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:55.680]
The commander speaking in Washington declined to give further details on the report.

[00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:06.080]
And a third quarter report released by the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles says that Broward, Panellis and Palm Beach counties are the fastest growing counties in Florida.

[00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:10.540]
And what about this $46 million Pennsylvania lottery win?

[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:11.540]
Yeah, what about it?

[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:13.460]
Well, I'm so glad you asked.

[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:17.320]
You get 1.4 million a year for 26 years.

[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:18.700]
And I keep working now.

[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:19.540]
I keep coming to work.

[00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:20.400]
I love it so much.

[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:22.900]
Well, you got to have the winning numbers.

[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:25.240]
No one has claimed the $46 million prize.

[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:27.800]
It's the largest in U.S. history.

[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:34.920]
And if it isn't claimed within a year, it will go into a fund for safe programs.

[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.940]
No, probably if I won it, I would take a plane trip to Portland, Maine, and I would take two things with me.

[00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:44.140]
One of them would be my winning lottery check and the other one would be a broom handle.

[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:46.320]
Okay, does that say it all?

[00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:48.860]
I think it's a very clear answer.

[00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:50.800]
Okay, the Zeta forecast.

[00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:52.400]
Partly set.

[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:52.980]
No, okay.

[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.040]
Partly sunny, breezy today.

[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.440]
How much Mr. Sports doing there?

[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:56.000]
I know.

[00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:58.140]
I 85, low 75.

[00:34:58.140 --> 00:34:59.900]
We have just a slight chance of rain.

[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.140]
71 degrees.

[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:03.080]
It's 752 on Zeta.

[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.000]
I'm Glenn Hill.

[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:05.820]
755 on Zeta 4.

[00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:07.520]
And you got another little goodie for us?

[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:08.800]
Another piece of great news.

[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:09.740]
Wonderful traffic.

[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:12.140]
Southbound Turnpike near the stadium.

[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:13.640]
Construction to the toll plaza.

[00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:16.760]
And that is slowing down traffic real bad, it says.

[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:23.120]
And at 27th Avenue and Northwest 207th Street, the Lake Lasern area, there's a shooting.

[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:27.360]
And it's Dave Captain Dave wrote lots of cops in the area.

[00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:29.020]
So you probably don't want to go over there.

[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.080]
Are they doing the shooting?

[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.180]
I don't just want to go.

[00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:32.340]
Could be.

[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.540]
Hey, listen, Dave Coutie, you never know.

[00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:35.780]
You don't miss the traffic.

[00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:36.260]
You never know.

[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:39.720]
Of course, that's for the lady in Boko who wants us to reinforce her paranoia.

[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.860]
Okay, now I know it's coming as a great shock to you.

[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.900]
And in the next star, we will hear the roaches, okay?

[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:45.520]
For that lady.

[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:46.240]
I'm promising.

[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:46.560]
Okay.

[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:48.620]
Why do you look like you don't want to hear the roaches?

[00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:49.180]
Well, that's not that.

[00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:50.200]
I just have my doubts.

[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:51.640]
That we are going to play it.

[00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:52.480]
Yeah, trust me.

[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:55.260]
But this hour, we're going to do something good because the PD is here.

[00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.080]
Hey, Rodgeroneo.

[00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:57.640]
Hey, Rodgeroneo, how are you doing?

[00:35:58.520 --> 00:35:59.280]
Love your show.

[00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:00.140]
Hey.

[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:01.240]
What?

[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:02.740]
He's on his own speaker phone.

[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:03.280]
Listen to that.

[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:05.200]
Why don't you get on the phone so we can hear you?

[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:06.320]
Okay.

[00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:09.960]
Oh, boy, this is a good guy.

[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.720]
I told you, these vocal calls are my favorites.

[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.200]
This is what radio is all about.

[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:15.920]
Come on, Rodger.

[00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:16.980]
Hello.

[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:17.540]
Hello.

[00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:17.580]

[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:18.040]
Yeah.

[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:20.580]
You sounded better in the barrel.

[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:21.280]
Cool.

[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:22.460]
What's up?

[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:23.340]
Nothing.

[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:26.920]
So you're making fun of my show.

[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:28.900]
Yeah, we were making fun of your show.

[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:32.100]
And Joey Reynolds is almost better than you are.

[00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:32.480]
You know it?

[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:33.300]
Yeah.

[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:34.080]
How old are you?

[00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:35.280]
13.

[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:36.160]
13.

[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:38.240]
Now, you're not the guy that called us the other day, are you?

[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:38.780]
No.

[00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:39.780]
Okay, good.

[00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:43.840]
Because you sound like you've lost a couple of years or lost something.

[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:44.560]
I'm not sure what.

[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:47.200]
Well, listen, I have a wonderful life, but I'm not going to press my luck.

[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:48.080]
I don't know what I mean.

[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:48.600]
No.

[00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:49.800]
Dave County, hello.

[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:51.380]
Want a meal?

[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:51.960]
How are you?

[00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:52.660]
I don't, Bert.

[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.280]
We're all doing great, sir.

[00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:54.920]
Uh, nearly.

[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.880]
There's a song I haven't noticed you play.

[00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:57.880]
I've listened to you all week.

[00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:58.600]
And what that'd be?

[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.420]
E-L-O's telephone line.

[00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:02.200]
I thought you said you liked that song.

[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:02.540]
I do.

[00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:03.000]
I love it.

[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:04.940]
Do we have E-L-O in the other room by any chance?

[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.440]
No, we have.

[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:08.460]
Oh, but we've got no time for the guest to.

[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:09.840]
No, don't say no.

[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:11.840]
Who the hell get his mic off?

[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:14.900]
I don't know.

[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:18.360]
I don't know.

[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:18.380]
I don't know.

[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:18.380]

[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:18.560]
I don't know.

[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:18.760]
I don't know.

[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:19.460]
I don't know.

[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:20.000]
I don't know.

[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:20.820]
I don't know.

[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.760]
I don't know.

[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:22.760]

[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:22.760]

[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:22.760]

[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:22.760]

[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:22.860]
I don't know.

[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:22.960]
I don't know.

[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:22.960]

[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:22.960]

[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:22.960]

[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:23.900]
I don't know.

[00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:25.200]
I don't know.

[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:25.300]

[00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:25.700]
I don't know.

[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:26.120]
I don't know.

[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:27.400]
I don't know.

[00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:29.100]
I don't know.

[00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:30.520]
I don't know.

[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:32.600]
I don't know.

[00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:41.140]
I don't know.

[00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:41.860]
Okay.

[00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:41.860]

[00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:42.960]
I was in Bob Rich here.

[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.540]
And I was looking for angel heart.

[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:46.080]
You were with Bob Rich ?

[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:47.840]
I was in Bob Rich's video store.

[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:48.360]
Oh, yeah.

[00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:49.560]
I was looking for angel heart.

[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:50.460]
And I couldn't find it.

[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:51.900]
Every time I go in there, they don't have it.

[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:52.120]
Yeah.

[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:54.760]
But I seen a movie and you kept talking about it.

[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.780]
And I got it and that movie was great, the hitter.

[00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:57.320]
Oh, yeah.

[00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:57.680]
Of course.

[00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:58.600]
I was a good movie.

[00:37:58.740 --> 00:37:59.060]
Classic.

[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:00.200]
That was good.

[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:01.540]
With Pete Thomas Howell.

[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:02.340]
That was good.

[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:02.620]
It was good.

[00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:03.960]
What a great second choice.

[00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:04.400]
Yeah.

[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:05.160]
And Rutger Howard.

[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:06.980]
Well, you kept talking about it.

[00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:07.320]
I forgot.

[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.140]
I'm going to try it.

[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:09.960]
I wasn't sure what it was about.

[00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:13.100]
It'll keep you right on the edge of your seat.

[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.220]
I mean, are you saying you're still not sure

[00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:15.880]
what it was about?

[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:17.720]
You been after you saw it?

[00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:18.640]
Oh no, I know what it's about.

[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:19.740]
But yeah, it was a good movie.

[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:20.160]
Okay.

[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:22.060]
I didn't know what it was when I picked it up.

[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.900]
I didn't know how bizarre it was gonna be.

[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:25.300]
I'm still waiting to see Blue Velvet.

[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:27.720]
All right, now you remember the scene where Tom Howell

[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:29.420]
is sitting there with a, waiting for the coffee

[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:32.180]
and Rutger Howard comes in and puts the pennies

[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:34.160]
on his eyelids and Tom Howell says,

[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:35.580]
why are you doing this to me?

[00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:37.180]
And he says, think about it.

[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:39.080]
No, I didn't get that part.

[00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:40.360]
Well, think about it.

[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.060]
All right.

[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:41.960]
That's the message.

[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:43.720]
I'm gonna lie this morning, Neil.

[00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:44.320]
Okay.

[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:45.640]
Thanks a lot.

[00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:46.100]
A Revenage.

[00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:49.180]
143, it's 803 on say to four.

[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:51.860]
Sunday shining, blue skies, beautiful day,

[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:53.600]
in spite of whatever he tells you during the weather.

[00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:54.300]
It looks magnificent.

[00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:55.760]
We got, we got a yellow.

[00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:58.580]
No, not right now.

[00:38:58.660 --> 00:38:59.920]
Don't see, I like to do that, Tim,

[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:01.380]
because he just, he just freaks out.

[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:03.540]
He just goes, no, later on, we'll play it a little later on.

[00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:05.500]
But I just wanted to make sure everything's under control.

[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:06.300]
Right?

[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:07.040]
Yeah.

[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:07.600]
Yeah.

[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:08.660]
Everything's fine.

[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:10.740]
Let's go to Rowered County.

[00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:11.100]
Hello.

[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:12.200]
Neil, yeah.

[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:12.860]
How you doing?

[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:13.520]
Welcome to FM.

[00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:14.600]
Thank you so much, sir.

[00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:16.880]
Much nice, because I have FM all over my house.

[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:18.560]
I only had AM in one little radio,

[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:20.040]
and I had to carry it from place to place.

[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:21.620]
Yeah, that AM is a real pain, you know?

[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:23.380]
Do you remember Ernest Angley?

[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:24.120]
Sure.

[00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:25.720]
Heel, say bye-bye.

[00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:26.440]
Bye-bye.

[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:29.340]
Super tramp, back breakfast in America every Sunday morning

[00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:30.500]
while he'd hit people in the head.

[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:32.180]
Oh, yeah, that ought to do it for you, yeah.

[00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:35.160]
That was, that was my, that was my line up on Sunday mornings.

[00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:36.820]
And I'm not talking about that today, but...

[00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:39.020]
We got to play Goodbye Stranger by Super tramp, too, huh?

[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:39.400]
Yeah.

[00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:41.100]
We got so much music we got to play now.

[00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:42.320]
I guess this is the last call.

[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:43.080]

[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:44.880]
Well, I hope not.

[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:45.700]
No, I'm just a joke.

[00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:48.000]
All right, well, listen, I just wanted to say good morning.

[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.640]
It's nice I could talk to you, because usually I'm in the car

[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:51.900]
or flying when you're on.

[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.480]
Well, you can call us from your mobile phone any time you want.

[00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:56.260]
I'm not rich enough to have a mobile phone.

[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:56.840]
You don't?

[00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:57.640]
No, sorry.

[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:58.680]
I think they're a waste.

[00:39:58.860 --> 00:39:59.980]
That speaks well for you, sir.

[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:00.360]
Yeah.

[00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:02.700]
To matter of fact, yeah.

[00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:04.380]
I do carry a beeper, though.

[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:05.320]
That's what really stands for.

[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:06.140]
You carry a beaver?

[00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:06.740]
Beaver.

[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:07.420]
Oh, beeper.

[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:08.160]
I agree.

[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:09.940]
OK, have a great weekend.

[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:10.280]
Hi.

[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:13.260]
I wasn't sure what he was talking about.

[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:13.280]

[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:14.320]
You know, this is a family show.

[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:14.900]
Look at this.

[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:15.880]
805.

[00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:17.100]
Just flying by.

[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:19.500]
And the weather is coming up almost as we speak.

[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:23.600]
Everything is like on time and things are happening and...

[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:25.280]
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:26.040]
I can't continue, can't.

[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:26.320]
I know.

[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:26.920]
Wait till Monday.

[00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:28.120]
We'll screw everything up Monday.

[00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:29.040]
Is it a forecast?

[00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:30.820]
It's beautiful outside.

[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.880]
Partly sunny, a little breezy today.

[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.260]
High will be about 85.

[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:34.600]
Yeah.

[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:36.520]
Low tonight, 75 and more news.

[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:37.960]
We have just a slight chance of rain.

[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.980]
And that is through the entire weekend.

[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:41.060]
Oh, boy.

[00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:42.940]
You bet you a 72 degrees.

[00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:44.140]
Isn't it great to be alive?

[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.060]
It's 806 on Zeta 4.

[00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:46.860]
I'm Glenn Hill.

[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:48.320]
Hey, young man.

[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:48.960]
Yeah.

[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.740]
Listen, I've seen you hanging around my house.

[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:52.380]
And I saw what I want to talk to you about.

[00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:53.140]
What did you make the best?

[00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:53.740]
I wasn't here now.

[00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:54.780]
I'm going to put it this way.

[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:55.080]
Yeah.

[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:59.280]
Wasn't you who did the push and put the stains upon the cushion.

[00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:02.080]
Put prints on the dashboard upside down.

[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:03.180]
Hey, what?

[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:04.460]
Who wasn't you?

[00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:07.660]
You broccoli billed and messing with my daughter Jill.

[00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:10.420]
If it was, you'd better leave this town.

[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:11.540]
Well, I got to say.

[00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:16.280]
Yes, it was I who did the push and put the stains upon the cushion.

[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:19.040]
Put prints on the dashboard upside down.

[00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:19.380]
Yeah.

[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:24.740]
But since I'm messing with your daughter, I've had trouble passing water.

[00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:27.200]
So I guess we're even all around.

[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:27.960]
Why you?

[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:28.940]
Come over here.

[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:29.700]
Come over here.

[00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:32.340]
Come over here.

[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:35.400]
Eight minutes after it on Zeta 4 Friday morning.

[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:38.040]
And I think we'll take one call before we do the roaches.

[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:39.280]
OK, because I've got to play that.

[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:44.380]
I feel so guilty if I don't get that in for that wonderful, lovely, loyal, whatever she was.

[00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:45.000]
Stayed County.

[00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:45.440]
Good morning.

[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:46.140]
Hey, Neil.

[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:46.620]
Good morning.

[00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:47.280]
How you doing?

[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:47.960]
Pretty good.

[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:48.620]
I haven't been listening.

[00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:49.460]
I just got off as well.

[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:50.520]
What's your hot topic?

[00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:51.940]
What's the topic?

[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:52.960]
What's the hot topic?

[00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:55.340]
Well, the hot topic today is your dream lineup.

[00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:57.420]
If you had your own radio station.

[00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:59.980]
Now, actually, you didn't hear the background behind it.

[00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:02.120]
It doesn't know how to take no for an answer.

[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.460]
OK, so we just tried to humor her.

[00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:04.720]
Or more?

[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:05.780]
She doesn't understand.

[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.440]
It's a stiff topic, OK?

[00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:08.660]
Unbelievable.

[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:11.700]
Linda just doesn't understand a stiff when she sees one.

[00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:16.460]
What about that pain in the ass woman that called up that didn't like your show and didn't like New York?

[00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:17.400]
Is she been bothering you?

[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:18.480]
Oh, I wish she would call back.

[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.680]
She was about my third favorite call of the week.

[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.180]
She was definitely in the top five.

[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:25.320]
She doesn't understand that life is empty and meaningless as your show.

[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:26.060]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:27.000]
You got it.

[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:28.840]
So it fits perfectly with her, right?

[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:29.500]
Right.

[00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:30.440]
Well, I've got you on tape.

[00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:31.620]
I'll listen to it tonight.

[00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:33.820]
And I'll listen to the rest now.

[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:35.120]
OK, have a great life.

[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:35.900]
You got a great day.

[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:37.020]
Thank you so much.

[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:37.820]
I'll read it there.

[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:38.480]
Oh, boy.

[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.600]
These people are so nice, you know?

[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:43.900]
But this is like the honeymoon week, the first week.

[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:45.240]
We're on the night.

[00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:49.040]
Next week, we start calling everybody douchebags and really getting into it with these people.

[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:50.240]
And it'll be a different story.

[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:54.060]
Hey, it's so nasty and I still, and it's disgusting.

[00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:55.660]
And stereo, no less.

[00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:55.900]
It's disgusting.

[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:56.920]
It's disgusting.

[00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:00.760]
And that's when we really start cooking, right?

[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:01.460]
Yeah.

[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:03.460]
By the way, we want to just make one comment.

[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:08.260]
We love the consultants and we want to let them know that because for some, it's our reason.

[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:09.600]
They love the show already, you know?

[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:11.680]
And just leave us alone and it'll be OK.

[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:16.040]
The first, the first time they say anything, like even how low it'll be over, right?

[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:18.600]
We're not sensitive or anything, but enough is enough.

[00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:19.260]
Boy.

[00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:20.060]
You have something there?

[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:22.980]
Well, you know, the traffic today, it's not like traffic.

[00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:24.420]
It's like a police report today.

[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:26.280]
Well, this is like a police state, OK?

[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:29.220]
You're a local Gestapo is watching you, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:31.280]
Now we have a car chase going on.

[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:34.920]
It's around Northwest 2nd, up to 44th Street, it says.

[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:35.260]
Right.

[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.120]
Yeah, it's not like traffic.

[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:38.780]
That's another good part of town, too, right?

[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:40.360]
OK, 10 minutes after raid.

[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:41.580]
Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:43.120]
Here's the moment we've promised.

[00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:44.280]
I've promised, OK?

[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:48.700]
And in spite of all your skepticism, that wonderful, lovely loyal listeners.

[00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:49.400]
Isn't that what we're into?

[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:50.560]
Unzade of loyal listeners.

[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:51.520]
Is going to get her way.

[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:54.680]
Of course, Peter is very happy that we're appealing to the loyal listeners.

[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:57.280]
He's not going to be so happy that we're playing obscure music.

[00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:59.500]
But so what else is new unzade, right?
