[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.560]
Upside!

[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:11.500]
Alan Box was a normal man with a wife, children, a summer home in Opalaca, and a chain of radio stations.

[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.600]
Well, normal that is until just three weeks ago.

[00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.800]
Hi, honey. How was your day?

[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.240]
Un...

[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.820]
Believable.

[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.320]
Terminal!

[00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.500]
There's nothing but subhuman douchebags out there.

[00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.160]
Alan Box is suffering from Neal Rogers disease.

[00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.420]
Have you canceled the Miami Herald yet?

[00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.640]
But honey, we don't subscribe to the Herald.

[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.380]
Oh, no, that's a cop out.

[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.020]
What kind of a lame excuse is that?

[00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.060]
Just say no to L-Herald, sir.

[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.400]
Huh?

[00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.360]
People afflicted with Neal Rogers disease have lost the ability to communicate like normal human beings.

[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.880]
What's the matter with you?

[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.200]
Blue-haired old bags from Fembroke Pines.

[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.180]
You know, the Yenfeds who say, oh, Neal, how can you say those nasty things?

[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.160]
Running around stealing sweet and low.

[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.300]
Can I get you anything?

[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.520]
How about those bad boys at Windixi?

[00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:58.680]
You know, it doesn't hurt to look.

[00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.220]
In?

[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.480]
Credible.

[00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.940]
Neal Rogers disease, a growing South Florida epidemic.

[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.700]
Please help us find a cure.

[00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.440]
Honey, it's Friday night.

[00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.840]
You know what that means.

[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.840]
Hey, you know what I got?

[00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:10.280]
I'm not.

[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.920]
I'm not.

[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.480]
What's Lephaler got?

[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.240]
Three points, nothing.

[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.080]
Send your tax deductible contributions today in care of hot 105.

[00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:18.540]
Terminal!

[00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.020]
Un...

[00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.560]
Believable.

[00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.240]
Is it really?

[00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:23.260]
No, wait.

[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.080]
108.

[00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.840]
Well, listen, he waited two minutes today before he slinked in here, wasn't that good?

[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.720]
Well, let's see, who do I have to thank?

[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.540]
I guess I have to thank you.

[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.700]
You have for the great job that you did while I was away.

[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.640]
Hmm.

[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.880]
Kyle's already shaking his head in dismay.

[00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.220]
Well, listen, we lie a lot, you know.

[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.460]
And Mike Spindell.

[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.240]
In fact, that's what we're going to be doing this morning.

[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.360]
We're going to take a poll as to whether I should do the show today, okay?

[00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.140]
Did you hear that on what day was that Sunday for an hour?

[00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.100]
A poll.

[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.460]
On whether he should do the show yesterday.

[00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.440]
How did it come out?

[00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.180]
The wrong way.

[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.660]
And who else, Fred Chatz?

[00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:12.940]
Fred Chatz was great.

[00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.720]
Why does it sound so strange in here again?

[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.940]
Have they been messing with stuff?

[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.960]
Doesn't it sound peculiar in here like hollow?

[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.480]
No.

[00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:22.920]
Like real burly.

[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.000]
You sound...

[00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.580]
Strange.

[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.860]
Good.

[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.840]
Well, listen, you want to take another couple of days and maybe I'll get my mouth back.

[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.200]
No.

[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.360]
Mike Wolf did the day.

[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.560]
Mike Wolf, we thank Mike for, you know, whatever he did.

[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.940]
And you have to thank me.

[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.220]
I already did.

[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.620]
Okay.

[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.140]
All right.

[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.420]
Once was more than a knock.

[00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.860]
Okay.

[00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.220]
I sound strange here this morning.

[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.360]
It's not really me.

[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.320]
So don't blame me.

[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.900]
I guess it must have been that one exciting day I spent in Detroit when the high was 59.

[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.080]
And it rained all day.

[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.640]
From the time I got off the plane to the time I had enough sense to get out of that town.

[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.480]
It never stopped raining and the high was 59.

[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.160]
Now I realize why I left the north.

[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.400]
I will never go back up north again.

[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.900]
Never, ever.

[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.860]
And those of you idiots out there, oh, I missed the change of season.

[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.960]
The city, the leaves falling.

[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.660]
Look at it on a picture postcard.

[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.960]
Will you forget it?

[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.420]
It's a joke.

[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.980]
It's a tragedy.

[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.340]
And it was still summer when you were there.

[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.400]

[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.920]
Before labor.

[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.180]
Yeah, the summer there last about two days.

[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.200]
Not consecutively necessarily.

[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.080]
There is no summer anymore up north.

[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.840]
Forget it.

[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.260]
But the TV down was okay.

[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.100]
And I, you know, cashed a lot of tickets and won money every night at the TV down.

[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.940]
And then came back here to punch my brains out of Calder, which is another story.

[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.080]
Oh, really?

[00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.980]
A pummeling seldom seen in the history of paramutual wagering.

[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.540]
Sell them seen.

[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.700]
And if Michael Lee is listing this morning.

[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.160]
That ride on the sixth horse in the, whatever the ninth race yesterday on us.

[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.620]
And then the scale of zero that, you know, you realize I tore up my Calder pants last night.

[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.900]
That's how disgusted I am.

[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.020]
They were over.

[00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.320]
Hearing those messages, I'll be saying, hey, there's nothing like spending.

[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.360]
There's nowhere I'd rather be on a great summer afternoon that it called her.

[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.380]
And that's true.

[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.480]
If I could afford it.

[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.540]
But I got news for you.

[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.260]
Even those of us with the deep pockets, you know, can only go so long.

[00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.160]
And the Mike Gonzalez had a great day yesterday.

[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.480]
He had four winners and I had three of them and God bless them.

[00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.920]
But he's the only guy I cash on out there.

[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.220]
And most of his horses go off three to five, you know.

[00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.020]
So it's a grim situation.

[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.940]
Is that the word grim?

[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.340]
It's a thord going on.

[00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.940]
And then to top it off, this guy and his girlfriend who never go to the track.

[00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.840]
They went there yesterday because I talk about it all the time, right?

[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.160]

[00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.000]
And the closest I came to really hitting it big, I had a four, seven, ten,

[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.500]
not nobody cares about this, but I have to tell it anyway.

[00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.900]
I've got the four, seven, ten, perfect box like in the fourth race, okay?

[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.720]
The four takes the lead in the stretch.

[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.940]
The five is second and the ten is coming with Mike Gonzalez on the outside.

[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.100]
Can't miss second.

[00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.180]
And I've got a three dollar perfect box.

[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:23.020]
Four, ten is going to pay about 250 bucks, which means I've got $375 coming back

[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.760]
if the ten horse gets second.

[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.180]
The ten is going to pass the five like he's standing still, right?

[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:35.540]
Well, all of a sudden here's Baltazar on the rail who can't get arrested coming back

[00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.680]
with a five horse and they finish almost dead even at the wire.

[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:45.580]
And I run over to the monitor and I watch the replay and the ten gets beat by a 18th of an inch per second.

[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.620]
And I just heave my tickets in the air, sit down in the chair, slump down in the chair and discussed.

[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:59.860]
Now this guy who never goes to the track and his young blonde girlfriend come racing over and he hands me a ticket.

[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.680]
Dollar try box, four, five, ten.

[00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.280]
Wow.

[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.720]
Which the two dollar try paid $2100.

[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.720]
He doesn't know a horse from his elbow this guy and he's collecting $1,100.

[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.680]
But isn't that lunch?

[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.660]
Bones to the window, cashes the ticket, comes back, hands me a five dollar bill and leaves.

[00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.940]
This is not the way it always is though.

[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.780]
People, you know, no, no anything about horses.

[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.660]
It was just the upset.

[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.120]
And then I get Michael Lee who's standing straight up.

[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.760]
He's two lengths off the lead with his horse 19 to one.

[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:41.840]
And now he's standing straight up and he goes all the way back to dead last on the turnway last, okay?

[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.900]
Now he gets the horse in gear and he's running like a maniac on the turn.

[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.260]
Passes half of the field and finishes a desperate fifth.

[00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.240]
I know I should.

[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.780]
Michael Lee.

[00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.060]
I know I shouldn't laugh, but just a little chuckle.

[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.040]
To know your upset.

[00:06:59.040 --> 00:06:59.940]
To know your upset.

[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.700]
To say the best.

[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.820]
I love Calder, but they don't love me.

[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.420]
You didn't really tear your pass up.

[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:07.840]
Oh yes.

[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.260]
Oh my gosh.

[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.620]
Oh my gosh.

[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.760]
And how did Mr. Calder do?

[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.320]
Mr. Calder's been doing just fine.

[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.320]
He keeps cashing tickets.

[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.720]
He keeps pulling them out of somewhere.

[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:20.360]
I don't know where.

[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.200]
Well, he's never going to have to go back to work.

[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.000]
Of course not.

[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.020]
That's what you think.

[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.180]
Just wait till Calder opens.

[00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.060]
It'll be all over.

[00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:27.920]
But Calder Magic.

[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.760]
He only wins a track's named after him.

[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:30.200]
Right.

[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.300]
There aren't too many.

[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.860]
So I guess if I was to find Rogers Downs or some Neil Downs, I would do great, you know.

[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.440]
Boy, a lot of things have happened since I left.

[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.080]
I see sandies on the air.

[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:48.200]
And you know that's the only talk show in America where the host and the guest lie down when the show is going on.

[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.320]
It's true.

[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:53.380]
I tuned her in for about 30 seconds this morning and she had some lawyer on.

[00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.100]
And they were both, I mean nobody can be sitting up and be that boring.

[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.420]
You know, it can sound asleep.

[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.980]
So I think they must have reclining chairs.

[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.760]
They could do that show from a hospital bed.

[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:03.260]
Exactly.

[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.860]
In fact, most of the listeners must be in hospital beds.

[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.980]
And if they're not, they're going to be in a coma very shortly.

[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.500]
And soon in some time of a bed somewhere.

[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.700]
Boy, she is so boring, unbelievable.

[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.300]
I have a real depressing story to tell.

[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.660]
I got a lot of me present to tell.

[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:23.980]
That's what the audience love.

[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:24.620]
Oh, I know.

[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.860]
Because they're stuck down here.

[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.500]
They don't realize how good they've got it.

[00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.300]
The weather is great.

[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.600]
Everything else thinks, but the weather is great.

[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:36.300]
And I got news to you when it's the end of August and it's 59 for the high and feels like about 30.

[00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.140]
Oh, we had wind chill.

[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:39.480]
Oh, yeah.

[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.740]
The only good thing in Detroit was Dick Pertin, who is still on the air.

[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:46.560]
He's on Z95.5 or something like that.

[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:46.800]

[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.480]
And he's still got about three people that do the show with him, including one guy who sounds just like Casey Kassam.

[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:52.500]
Oh, no.

[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:53.200]
Yeah.

[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:54.020]
Oh, no.

[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.280]
And Pertin is still, you know, doing talk-ups and stepping all over the record intentionally.

[00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:58.900]
Oh, right.

[00:08:59.400 --> 00:08:59.820]
It's great.

[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.100]
And he's got Casey Jr. with him.

[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:02.320]
Yeah.

[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.360]
And about two other people.

[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.300]
It's a real show.

[00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:08.620]
In a real city, but unfortunately, the weather there is pathetic.

[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:08.880]
Yeah.

[00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:09.680]
So a good luck to him.

[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:13.320]
The only good thing in Detroit besides the Dick Pertin show was White Castle hamburgers.

[00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.200]
Oh, my gosh.

[00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:15.240]
With a drive-through.

[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.440]
Oh, no.

[00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:21.160]
I was only there a day and a half and I went through the drive-through three times at White Castle.

[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:26.680]
And some of you out there, you know, the people in the audience give more misinformation on these talk shows.

[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.580]
Oh, to Pinkas is closed.

[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:29.980]
That restaurant's been closed.

[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:30.780]
It's not closed.

[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:31.680]
It's still open.

[00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:33.860]
It's a huge restaurant.

[00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:37.660]
They're on telegraph and six mile or seven mile, whatever the hell it is.

[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.400]
And they had a full-payed jet in the Detroit Free Press.

[00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:45.060]
And when I kept going by there and I saw all the cars there and then I saw the ad in the Free Press,

[00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:46.520]
I figured they probably are not closed.

[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:51.380]
I mean, there are too many places that buy a full-payed jet in the newspaper when they're closed.

[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.100]
No.

[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:52.940]
Not too many.

[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.360]
I mean, it would be something to open the Herald tomorrow for those of you who still get it,

[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.620]
see a full-payed jet for the monks in.

[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:02.400]
Wouldn't that be great?

[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:08.220]
We closed six years ago, but you know, we still like to little PR,

[00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.860]
like to keep in touch with our friends.

[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.520]
And especially with the Pope coming, you never know.

[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.820]
Wouldn't he be great if the monks in were still open?

[00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.220]
They could put the Pope to work.

[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:20.280]
There is a waiter with that silly little frock, you know, that he wears that little dress.

[00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.120]
And as beanie, it would be great.

[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.920]
And Channel 7, by the way.

[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.560]
And you notice I stalled about 10 minutes after that spot.

[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:29.220]
Can you believe that they're doing that thing?

[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.880]
We're a ribbon for peace.

[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.580]
The two days, Thursday and Friday when the Pope is here,

[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.540]
like all of us are supposed to be caught up in this thing.

[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:37.600]
I thought he was Catholic.

[00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:38.560]
Am I wrong?

[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:40.520]
Is he non-denominational now?

[00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:41.440]
He's bigger than life.

[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.540]
And if you've seen him lately, believe me.

[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:44.860]

[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.880]
He has to go to the Tall and Big Men shop to get his dress.

[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:51.900]
You can't say that.

[00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:53.300]
I just said it.

[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.740]
He gets his dress the same place that Joey Reynolds gets it.

[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.740]
Joey Pinto, welcome to town, Joey.

[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.720]
I can't believe it.

[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.200]
I heard him for about three minutes this morning.

[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.520]
He is so bad that it's unbelievable.

[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.700]
And he's trying to do, I don't know what it is he's trying to do

[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.780]
because he plays no music and he brags about it.

[00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:09.960]
Right.

[00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:11.400]
It's a comedy show.

[00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:12.100]
It is?

[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:12.800]
Allegedly.

[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:13.900]
Well, that's what he says.

[00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:17.160]
Big buildup on his Bruce Springsteen cut that he was going to play.

[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.800]
And he goes on and on and on.

[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.220]
And by the way, Joey Pinto, aka Joey Reynolds.

[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.020]
I guess he's been taking shots of me.

[00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.040]
He doesn't even know who I am.

[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:27.780]
I know who you are.

[00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:28.960]
Never heard me in his life.

[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.440]
He taught you everything you know.

[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.440]
He taught me everything I know.

[00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:32.640]
The guy doesn't even know me.

[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:33.740]
But I know him.

[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.120]
Oh, do I know him?

[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.020]
There's a great story about him.

[00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:44.420]
There was a group called the Rock and Rebels who had a record called Wild Weekend on Swan Records.

[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:45.700]
Many years ago as an instrumental.

[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:48.000]
I vaguely remember.

[00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:53.100]
And it was Tommy Shannon's theme song and Tommy Shannon and Joey Reynolds worked at WKBW and Buffalo

[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.520]
which is where Joey was successful.

[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.860]
And he should have stayed there forever because that's the only place he made it was in Buffalo.

[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.460]
And that's because the people there were all like a block of ice.

[00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:01.320]
They never thought out.

[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.500]
They couldn't change the dial.

[00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:05.120]
So Joey was very successful.

[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.020]
You know, it was the only station in the market with a signal.

[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:14.000]
And anyway, these kids that made that record on Swan Records, I don't want to say who they had a contract with,

[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.300]
who their agents were.

[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.480]
I don't want to mention any names.

[00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.020]
They never collected a dime in royalties.

[00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:24.620]
And that record was released several times and overall sold over a million records.

[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.280]
And they never saw a penny of the royalties.

[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:32.900]
And when they try to get a lawyer and do something about it, nobody could find their contract and it disappeared.

[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:34.140]
What contract?

[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.180]
You know, it's like here.

[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.800]
When Gilbertson comes down again and say, what contract?

[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:38.780]
You don't have a contract.

[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:40.780]
I'll say, but what about this?

[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:42.000]
Oh, you must have made that up.

[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.160]
We don't have any copy of that.

[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.000]
It's the way it is in this business.

[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:50.240]
As they say in West highly, it's a dog-y dog business.

[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:58.520]
And I had a deep, well, not only did I have a depressing day at Calder yesterday, I'm sitting at home and I called Stan and I said,

[00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:01.280]
well, let's go have, let's at least go eat a good meal somewhere, right?

[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.860]
So he says, okay, I'll be over at about 10, 15 minutes.

[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:05.940]
I put the phone down.

[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.340]
Two minutes later, it rings.

[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:08.780]
And I thought, well, he's calling back.

[00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:12.200]
He had some brain storm over to go eat, right?

[00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:13.460]
Wrong.

[00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.140]
I mean, here I've plunged my brains out.

[00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:23.880]
But I am so depressed, I'm tearing up my Calder pass, which for me is like blasphemy, okay?

[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:26.840]
And whose voice do you think is on the other end of that line?

[00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:29.660]
I can't imagine.

[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:30.640]
Well, let me take the break.

[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.560]
I mentioned there are a lot of people in the audience who already know.

[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.620]
I have to do as mentioned the word, depressed.

[00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:37.780]
Oh, no.

[00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:39.660]
And it gives me a great, good, good, good, good, good.

[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:40.600]
Oh, it was.

[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:41.440]
Oh, no.

[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.460]
Oh, boy.

[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.480]
I mean, 21 past 10.

[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.300]
At WINZ, we'll come right back.

[00:13:52.560 --> 00:14:00.360]
Mr. Keshe, where you'd in a time of wild, and money from the arms sales to I ran, was being

[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.800]
illegally devoid of the contrast, you know, Mr. Senator?

[00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:09.360]
I'm glad you asked that question, because the countries are guerrillas, and guerrillas always

[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:14.580]
remind me of the monkeys, and isn't a great, that after all these years, they're once

[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:18.180]
again the hardtrap of teenagers all across the US of it.

[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.320]
Mr. Keshe, where you just answer the question.

[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:26.280]
Well, sir, there's nothing I'd like better, but on the advice of council, I'm most regrettably

[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:31.140]
and respectfully decline your request, but don't go away, because I'm going to take the

[00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:31.340]
fifth.

[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.400]
And of course, I can only mean the fifth dimension.

[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:42.180]
The year was 1967, with this persecution, will the God promote this man from the train by

[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:46.120]
immediately, sees those mangai will compound you the jackpot.

[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:51.020]
24 past 10 at WINZ, I do sound strange today, don't I?

[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:56.540]
I'm having withdrawal symptoms from being back in the building.

[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.380]
Oh, and from that phone call I had last night.

[00:14:59.380 --> 00:14:59.660]
Oh, yeah.

[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:06.720]
Before I get into the phone call though, we got a lot of sick people in this audience.

[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.920]
You don't really do have a lot of sick people in the audience.

[00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:10.540]
You haven't noticed.

[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:11.200]

[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:16.060]
Anyway, seeing their minding my own business, it's labor day, right?

[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:16.580]
It's a holiday.

[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.800]
You don't call up people that you know.

[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:22.560]
I don't want to say friends, because I would not use that word in regard to this individual.

[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:23.320]
Appointances.

[00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:24.180]
Appointances.

[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.300]
On a holiday and depress them, would you?

[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:27.460]
Colleagues, no.

[00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.620]
I would especially somebody that helped to get you a job.

[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:36.780]
But don't forget, it's not important in life that you succeed, but that your friends fail.

[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:37.980]
Just remember that.

[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:42.960]
And this particular individual is probably the premier advocate of that philosophy.

[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:43.680]
I agree.

[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:48.260]
Making a life career now being a professional troublemaker.

[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.520]
Has he left the big plop?

[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:52.200]
Oh, yeah.

[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:52.900]
He's gone.

[00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:56.460]
Bob pardon me for being depressing Lanciter.

[00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:58.440]
On the phone.

[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.840]
Is there a call for two reasons?

[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:03.460]
One to tell me that he finally got out of WPLP.

[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.780]
He's not working for this company anymore.

[00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:06.060]
Right.

[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.440]
And he went to WFLA and he's doing great and they love him.

[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:12.480]
He's not making as much money as he had been suggesting he was going to make.

[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.960]
But he's doing great, you know, 450 an hour or something like that.

[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:16.560]
He's doing great.

[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.220]
And with his talent, that's, you know, overpaid at worst.

[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:26.340]
And number two, like the guy's writing a book or something, he must be writing a book.

[00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:30.460]
Wanted to find out the true story about all these wild rumors he's hearing.

[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:32.600]
Oh, about you.

[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.640]
I should have asked him, are you writing a book, Bob?

[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:35.900]
Are you writing my life story?

[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.180]
On a Labor Day, on a holiday.

[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:40.780]
Doesn't matter.

[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:41.980]
The man calls up.

[00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:47.700]
Matters to tell me all of these wild things about how Bob Gilbertson is still bad-mouthing me

[00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:52.920]
and talking to the management of WPLP in Tampa and wants to fire me and his very upset

[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:57.340]
and having an nervous breakdown and about how Tim Williams, our national sales managers,

[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:02.500]
telling the people over there that they can't sell this show and that there's no advertising on this show

[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.820]
and on and on and on and on.

[00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:09.160]
And by the time I got through, I didn't know whether to cut up my call to pass or cut up Lanciter.

[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:14.580]
As a matter of fact, if he would have been closer, I would have liked to have tried to do both at the same time.

[00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:21.820]
I could have taped the pass over his heart and used one of those skewers, you know, from the barbecue pit on Labor Day.

[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:23.540]
Unbelievable.

[00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:26.240]
Terminal and depressing.

[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:33.260]
Then I come in here this morning in our program director whose photograph is still where the moon don't shine.

[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.920]
You were there, you were there.

[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.600]
And this comes in the office and says, well Gary's not here again this week.

[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:43.480]
So if Bob Gilbertson calls, I'm transferring the call to the bird, you know, or something like that.

[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.320]
That's what he said.

[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:46.000]
He did say that, boy.

[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.220]
That's fine.

[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.300]
A bunch of nervous nellies, aren't they?

[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.460]
And I got news for him.

[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:52.320]
I'm showing up every day.

[00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:54.540]
Then there were other wild rumors while I was gone.

[00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:57.000]
I'm going to Chicago to WLS.

[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:57.480]
Right.

[00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:58.760]
A music station.

[00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:00.400]
I don't know anybody in Chicago.

[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:02.760]
I've never talked to anybody in Chicago.

[00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:04.600]
I don't want to work in Chicago.

[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:05.160]
Okay.

[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.200]
You hate Chicago.

[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.180]
I hate Chicago.

[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.100]
Well, it comes are okay.

[00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.540]
The weather is the weather is horrendous.

[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:12.000]
It's rocious.

[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:19.120]
They had about 85 feet of water standing there with like Michigan, Lake Michigan had moved into Chicago.

[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:23.540]
While I was on vacation, it's all they were talking about is that Chicago was underwater,

[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.200]
which was a blessing for the Cubs, by the way.

[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:30.640]
Okay.

[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.620]
Big sports fan over here.

[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:33.080]
If you say so.

[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.360]
I'll just go back and talk about that racit call to Rickon.

[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:36.940]
Here's Michael Lee.

[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.380]
I mean, he's two lengths off the lead.

[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:39.740]
He's sitting perfect on the turn.

[00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:40.660]
He's got a ton of horse.

[00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:44.540]
And now he, and then the other day on Friday or Saturday.

[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.180]
Here's Teresa Peters.

[00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.240]
I call her Shirley Peters.

[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.220]
She's one of the jockeys.

[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:50.280]
So to speak.

[00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:54.660]
I mean, I've got a few jockeys out there that really we ought to send him out to the farm club,

[00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:55.820]
send him up to finger lakes.

[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:56.280]
Okay.

[00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:00.520]
Give him a little seasoning before you get the public to put their hard earned money on these people.

[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:02.320]
Shirley Peters.

[00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.960]
She's got this seven horse, which has just been claimed.

[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.180]
I can't think of the name of the horse, but the horse gets bet down like crazy.

[00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:11.460]
So naturally, I put a few bucks on the horse because it looked like it had a good shot.

[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.700]
And in the backstreet, surely have you ever seen a girl on a hobby horse?

[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:16.060]
Yeah.

[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:18.280]
How the horse goes up and down and up.

[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.740]
And she's standing and she's got, she's got the rain straight up in the air.

[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.360]
And she's rocking up and down.

[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.140]
And you don't make up a lot of ground when you're going up and down.

[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:27.440]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:32.240]
Very hard for a horse to go forward when he's going up and down like a hobby horse.

[00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:37.960]
Needless to say, he's at the top of the stretch right now in a desperate drive.

[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:43.460]
Boy, it's unbelievable.

[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.960]
It's incredible, but I don't want to cry sour grapes.

[00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:50.180]
You know, just because I lost, you know, 80, 90,000 or whatever it was.

[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.920]
Now there are people are going to believe that, too, you see.

[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:54.500]
Sure.

[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:55.180]
Sure these are me rumors.

[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.240]
Believe whatever you like.

[00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:00.780]
You know, when you're making five, six hundred thousand a year, it must be nice.

[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:01.840]
That's all I can say.

[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.540]
But that's about it.

[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.020]
Don't have any great stories at all.

[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.540]
It's basically about it.

[00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:08.560]
Oh, no.

[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:09.720]
Oh, yes.

[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:11.680]
Well, what else did you want?

[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.580]
Well, you always have great stories when you come back from vacation.

[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.040]
About little adventures you had, you know.

[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:18.960]
I didn't have any adventures.

[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:19.960]
I'll be darned.

[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:20.680]
Unfortunately.

[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.260]
Did you go to East Lansing?

[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:25.100]
You didn't go.

[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:25.280]
No.

[00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:26.360]
Are you kidding me?

[00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:27.700]
Weather was too bad, huh?

[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.780]
I got out of Michigan so fast.

[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:30.280]
Okay.

[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:31.080]
And where did you go?

[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:31.780]
Made a B line.

[00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:32.900]
Where did you go, New York?

[00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:33.500]
Yeah.

[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.880]
I did go to Don and Bob's every day again.

[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.460]
That's the only reason I went back there to eat.

[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.340]
I had like six meals a day.

[00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:39.840]
It was great.

[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.440]
What else is there to do there, right?

[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:43.760]
Well, you can do that when you're on vacation.

[00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:44.820]
You're allowed to do that.

[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:46.460]
Yeah.

[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.380]
And I heard the food was coming in here.

[00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:51.260]
I heard they got a whole bunch of stale bagels on Spendel show the other day.

[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:52.260]
Perfect.

[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:52.800]
Stale.

[00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:53.780]
Yes.

[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:54.900]
Mernous stale.

[00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:55.260]
Yeah.

[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.260]
I said perfect.

[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:57.600]
Mernous and his favorite.

[00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.560]
We're going to get a hockey team together here.

[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:00.460]
The winds hockey team.

[00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:01.800]
We're going to use them as hockey pucks.

[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.380]
They were so stale.

[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.840]
And Mike was owing and I.

[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:07.980]
You know, those weekend people, anything for free.

[00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:08.820]
They just go nuts.

[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:10.000]
They'll show like crazy.

[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:10.340]
Yeah.

[00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:12.580]
They're in the refrigerator now if you want.

[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:12.640]

[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.180]
And the freezer.

[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:14.300]
Fawing out.

[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:17.720]
This is an envelope.

[00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:19.620]
Well, we don't want to go into that.

[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.560]
I mean, I just heard it with the best of intentions.

[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.520]
And then of course it winds up a four hour show on bagels.

[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.460]
Which is fine because that's what we're going to do today.

[00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:27.980]
We're going to do a...

[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:28.860]
Let's see.

[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:29.760]
What could we do today?

[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.820]
Besides, he covered bagels pretty well.

[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:33.120]
How about white castle?

[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.040]
Somebody mentioned that the other day.

[00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:35.800]
The boils are good.

[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:36.360]
I'm sorry.

[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.820]
Those are real good.

[00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.940]
The only exciting thing that happened in Detroit.

[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:41.960]
Friday evening.

[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:44.580]
And the rain is just pouring down.

[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:45.980]
And I'm not even going to go to the track.

[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:46.720]
And that kind of weather.

[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:49.960]
And I drive through white castle.

[00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:51.740]
And I've put my order in.

[00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:52.960]
You know, at the little megaphone.

[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.220]
I said, give me 80 cheese brothers.

[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.040]
I'm a bucket of coke.

[00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.080]
And I'm sitting there.

[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.520]
And there's one car in front of me.

[00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:02.040]
And there's one car behind me.

[00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:06.340]
And there's this very attractive young couple in the car.

[00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:07.080]
And there's this car behind me.

[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.740]
And she is...

[00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:11.080]
I don't know if she thought it was Halloween or what.

[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:13.340]
But she was bobbing for apples in a car.

[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:14.200]
I couldn't believe it.

[00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:17.120]
I kept looking in a rearview mirror by accident.

[00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:18.240]
Occasionally I look up.

[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:18.960]
Absolutely.

[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.300]
Because it was boring sitting there waiting for my hamburger.

[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:23.160]
And I couldn't believe this in Detroit.

[00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:27.180]
Which is probably the most sexless town in the history of America.

[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:28.460]
They don't even do it in Detroit.

[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:29.580]
No, that's not true.

[00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:30.380]
They pretend that...

[00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:31.040]
No, they don't.

[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:32.420]
They do not do it in Detroit.

[00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:33.360]
Nobody does it.

[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.560]
Most of them don't even think about it.

[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.420]
Well, that's why we're going to become down here.

[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:39.620]
You know that.

[00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:40.880]
That's what's going to happen here.

[00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:43.500]
We're not even going to think about it.

[00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:44.800]
And make a lot of...

[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:45.580]
Didn't we already...

[00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:45.700]
Yeah.

[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.280]
We didn't mandate that before I went away.

[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:47.800]
That's right.

[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:49.180]
It hadn't taken effect.

[00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:50.780]
That's why they brought Joey Reynolds down here.

[00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:50.960]
Exactly.

[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.320]
Because looking to him for about a half an hour,

[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.060]
you'd lose your appetite to ever do it again.

[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:54.560]
Exactly.

[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.000]
They're looking for him.

[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.400]
Speaking of strange voices, boy.

[00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.240]
And somebody said to me the other day,

[00:22:59.320 --> 00:22:59.740]
what is he about?

[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:00.180]
40?

[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.960]
And I got up off the floor.

[00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:03.620]
I mean, I said,

[00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:04.820]
you got to be kidding me.

[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:05.480]
This guy,

[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.520]
50 easy and maybe beyond.

[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:09.220]
Weird 48.

[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:10.320]
Weird 48.

[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:10.660]
Yeah.

[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:12.600]
1848.

[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:12.960]
Yeah.

[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:13.500]
That's when he began.

[00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:15.240]
I think he's closer to 60,

[00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:15.980]
personal.

[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:17.620]
All he's in is 50, so if he's a day.

[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:18.160]
Yeah.

[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.100]
Yeah.

[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.320]
They're looking for him in New York,

[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:20.740]
by the way.

[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.020]
I'm looking for him.

[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.160]
They wonder what happened to him.

[00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:24.920]
I want to talk to him about those letterman spots

[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.100]
that he read on the air that time in 1963,

[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.420]
when I was in Batavia.

[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.060]
See, he doesn't know who I am.

[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.560]
He doesn't even know that I know him.

[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:32.200]
He doesn't know anything.

[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:32.300]

[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:32.460]
He doesn't know anything.

[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:32.460]

[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:32.460]

[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:32.460]

[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:32.460]

[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:34.460]
But I got Joey Pinto stories that will go back.

[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.380]
See, the guy was in Buffalo doing just fine.

[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:37.520]
Right.

[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.740]
Nobody could change the dial.

[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:41.180]
Okay, and it was the only station they could pick up.

[00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:43.720]
Then all of a sudden he goes to Detroit,

[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:44.880]
to WXYZ,

[00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:46.380]
bombed, I mean,

[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.340]
the biggest bomb since Hiroshima,

[00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:49.480]
okay, just pathetic.

[00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:54.220]
And WKNR was destroying XYZ at that time.

[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.260]
They were both rock stations.

[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:55.680]
The inner.

[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:55.860]
The inner.

[00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:55.880]
The inner.

[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:56.080]
The inner.

[00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:00.560]
The inner.

[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:01.420]
Anyone who has a lucky,

[00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:01.420]

[00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:01.420]

[00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:01.420]

[00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:01.420]

[00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:01.420]

[00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:01.420]

[00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:02.460]
like that hot news jingle.

[00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:03.500]
Is that why you listened to that?

[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:04.900]
You know, he was all the sour grapes.

[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:06.020]
And they were dying.

[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:09.720]
XYZ was just a ghost of what he used to be.

[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:10.440]
Okay.

[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:11.880]
Lee Allen.

[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:12.980]
And all of these other

[00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:14.260]
hazbens, you know,

[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.020]
they enjoy eventually went up in New York.

[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:20.800]
Which everybody sooner or later winds up in New York.

[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:22.240]
Some of us are trying to avoid it.

[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:22.800]
WNBC.

[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:24.280]
Bombed in New York.

[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.320]
Went to Philadelphia,

[00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:28.700]
despised in Philly at best.

[00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:32.480]
okay now they bring them down here on she well here's a guy's like fifty years

[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:37.240]
old at least doing the morning show with a bunch of you know young kids on drugs

[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:42.660]
allegedly yeah and it just doesn't make any sense any of any music they say

[00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:47.400]
bond at all they'd say bon jovy to him and he goes huh well there's a group called

[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.620]
Europe I think is the name of the great isn't it and the lead singer looks a

[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:54.740]
little like bon jovy and I was watching on MTV the other day and I noticed he

[00:24:54.740 --> 00:25:00.260]

[00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:06.780]

[00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:13.660]
playing tennis the other day yeah well we don't want him he does absolutely in

[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:20.200]
his left ear and they're expecting their second kid so you know

[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:24.140]
tatums expecting the second kid at bond jovy and the John McEnroe yeah yeah

[00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:28.820]
right boy wait till we tell the Pope about that I know Pope doesn't know about

[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:33.720]
this see if the Pope thought the two guys could make babies the church is

[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:37.900]
positioned on homosexuality would turn around 180 degrees yeah I know even the

[00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:42.720]
priest would be making babies you know hey what's the wrong with that the

[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:51.680]
nice Catholic boy I'm not you that's the only way it's ever gonna change when two

[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:54.600]
guys can make a baby then the Catholic Church is gonna have some real second

[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:59.460]
thought I noticed the day lines have been flashing pretty not frantically here

[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:02.600]
but the brown is brown or not tuning in anymore they have no idea we don't

[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:06.640]
want to know whose responsibility that is there's one is it possible that you are

[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:11.240]
responsible no it is not possible one person I'll disagree he thinks it's very

[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:16.060]
possible that you might be responsible not too people chasing away part of the

[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:21.460]
I didn't chase anybody I will say this though it was marginally better than the

[00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:25.940]
country hearing so thank you now they're all bringing what I think that as a

[00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:28.520]
problem as a compliment or flashing which is fine we don't want to talk to

[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:33.140]
anyway right all Joey Reynolds up by the way they don't have any delay over

[00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:36.400]

[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:47.220]

[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:33.020]
vulture but he's like a true vulture kind of hovering over everybody's body

[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:36.880]
just waiting to swoop in right when he was here he was doing the same thing

[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:40.880]

because he's got his Yenta line see if I were that old Yenta line which I am

[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:09.980]
older than he is but if I were that age and I were a professional Yenta and I

[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:13.260]
don't want to mention any other names because there are some sensitive people in

[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:17.540]
the room as I speak but if I were that age and I had nothing else to do but spread

[00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:23.960]
rumors and gossip and just constantly be stirring the pot as the saying goes I

[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:30.500]

there in the FM this morning just to cut a spot or something I have a fit and

[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:20.280]
Gene Cashman was sitting in there on the console Gene was spinning around on

[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:23.260]
the turntable you know they play all those CDs so they got to do something with

[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:28.400]
the turntables and Gene was spinning around at 16 RPM was incredible was a

[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:32.260]
sight of beauty and a thing to behold I enjoyed it and Jeff Chase had a very

[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:12.920]
that yeah hi welcome back good to have you back by the way somebody did call i think while you were

[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:18.100]
gone wanting to know why when he dialed one eight hundred hoods but nobody answered that's true that's

[00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:23.580]
true someone did dialed it well then be rated Glenn hill for giving out the wrong number okay

[00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:28.180]
we'll never do it again yeah don't ever do give out hoods but numbers like that again and we'll

[00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:34.460]
take care of the surgery on Glenn tomorrow okay that was an accurate call actually we get a two for

[00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:39.020]
one we can get a surgery on joy rentals vocal cords right to make you Jewish at the same time

[00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:43.840]
fact maybe they could do a skin transplant if you thought about that listen you're laughing but i'm

[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:49.300]
serious there's something to think about the miracle of modern medicine they could probably take

[00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:55.320]
that little um do i dare say for skin and i do mean little and they could graft it on the joys vocal

[00:43:55.320 --> 00:44:01.840]
cords and by the end of the show he could sound like um bob laceter oh i'm so depressed

[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:09.740]
the sky is falling the sky is falling the world is coming oh god you're so wonderful we love to hear

[00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:03.720]
everything heard of it's a town of about twenty thousand people they've heard of and i've always

[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:08.020]
been astonished at how strikingly good looking all the people there were and when i went to

[00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:14.300]
batavia down zirvina i had never cashed a ticket in my life up until my vacation and i won every night

the trap people of all ages a lot of young people there of all ages right in fact they have a nursery

[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:38.320]

the concord could have got him there in time for post time at seven thirty they've got to do something

[00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:50.120]
about that in florida they really do they need to allow miners right i think at the track yeah not as

[00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:58.580]
long as governor more taxes in telehassy yeah silly man there's no reason are you attacking the

[00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:06.180]
governor now some mildly our wonderful pious religious born again douche bag is he coming down

[00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:10.520]
does governor gonna be here would not be attractive if we had the governor here with Reagan and the

[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:16.520]
Pope woo wow boy more than i can handle yeah i'll tell you one thing i would take some more calls but

[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:22.140]
they sounded so bad oh technically didn't they the whole setup sounds really strange shut up polaroid

[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:27.800]
oh really flash thank you so much i a tamper radio station

[00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:34.220]
a tamper radio station but it's not the one it's a real radio station don't you want to be a Q

[00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:40.460]
Q 105 you want to five yeah a real station i never want to mr. gloom and doom is on this is number one

[00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:46.900]
step so he pressed a tamper radio station's taking a swipe of governor bob more taxes as and his

[00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:54.000]
consumer services tax this morning the q-zoo oh that's original the morning team at wrb q radio

[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:59.940]
gave away its first role of bob martina's toilet paper he he he he each sheet of the paper has a

[00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:07.380]
picture of martina's and the slogan wipe out services taxes q-zoo tamper bay excellent i like that

[00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:16.820]
broadcasters shana stevens that's interesting it's shadow shana shana stevens shadow stevens

[00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:26.200]
it's a misprint my little confused here or what broadcasters shana stevens says the station has

[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:30.900]
hundreds of roles to give away to listeners who call it the right time i wonder what the right

[00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:36.620]
time would be the five percent consumer services taxes proven very unpopular and is the subject

[00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:42.700]
of legal action and a scheduled special session of the legislature later this month it places a five

[00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:47.680]
percent tax on most professional services including legal work accounting and advertising

[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:52.960]
medical services are not taxed our tina's has been the main supporter of the tax saying it's

[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:58.580]
needed to support the increased demand for state services credit shana stevens wrb q tamper

[00:53:58.580 --> 00:54:04.720]
well if it's shadow stevens outcome the misprinted twice i must be wrong you wrong could possibly

[00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:11.260]
you are wrong it's possible did you hear that we got to rob a fourteen it's not probable on

[00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:17.740]
September the eight nineteen eighty seven he said i could be wrong it's possible we'll call Bob

[00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:21.660]
and find out some disturbing stories from people out in the atrium about some of the shows you

[00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:26.480]

tongue and cheek songs i hope the erection song is in there is that on a tape now it's not on the tape

[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:36.980]

[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:11.900]

So to speak, Dade County, hello.

[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:37.520]
Nailed thing.

[01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:39.160]
Speaking.

[01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:40.880]
This is Nailed.

[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:42.100]
Yes, it is.

[01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:43.640]
Oh, all right.

[01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:46.360]
Turn that radio off.

[01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:47.200]
Okay, okay.

[01:27:47.820 --> 01:27:51.060]
I'm that thing about Tom Jacob that you said you heard him

[01:27:51.060 --> 01:27:52.440]
with Sam Geisen.

[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:53.760]
I didn't say I heard him.

[01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:54.900]
I heard that he was going to be on.

[01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:55.540]
Was that on tape?

[01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:56.260]
Yeah.

[01:27:56.780 --> 01:27:58.600]
Oh, I think he's back tomorrow.

[01:27:59.180 --> 01:28:00.120]
I told you he's coming back.

[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:00.480]
I remember.

[01:28:00.980 --> 01:28:02.880]
He was when he was what?

[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:07.120]
He was saying all kinds of Aussies things about you.

[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:09.300]
Sam Geisen, the guy with a false teeth?

[01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:09.900]
Yep.

[01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:11.200]
Unbelievable.

[01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:13.720]
It was, I got on the phone at least.

[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:18.000]
A lot of me, ten minutes of intelligence conversation with him.

[01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:18.760]
Wow.

[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:21.480]
You mean Tom wasn't defending me?

[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:24.000]
Tom was on the fence.

[01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:27.540]
That's the saying was fencing with Geisen.

[01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:31.600]
Geisen pulled from a pretty good verbiage, I guess.

[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:31.820]
Yeah.

[01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:33.320]
Well, that's a good station, I'll tell you.

[01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:38.820]
Well, I know there was nothing else on the radio.

[01:28:39.060 --> 01:28:41.880]
It could believe me that I was desperate listening to that one.

[01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:43.420]
Yeah, well, I'm glad you could pick it up.

[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:48.220]
Well, there is my list of tools because the second thing I heard of this month was Neil Rogers.

[01:28:48.540 --> 01:28:49.280]
Yeah, well, that's good.

[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:50.480]
And your dirtyness.

[01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:51.680]
I always loved Sam.

[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:53.380]
I'm glad to back during...

[01:28:53.380 --> 01:28:54.300]
She clean up his beard a little bit.

[01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:55.200]
Or any other way.

[01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:56.260]
Okay, thanks a lot.

[01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:56.840]
Bye-bye.

[01:28:57.160 --> 01:28:59.280]
Sam Geisen is picking on me now too.

[01:28:59.420 --> 01:29:00.360]
Well, you really read that.

[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:04.280]
By the way, the article by Aaron Sachs, because somebody else sent a copy to me was in the

[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:05.380]
Broward Review.

[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:05.760]
Oh.

[01:29:06.420 --> 01:29:06.480]
Okay.

[01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:07.120]
All right.

[01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:07.820]
Just get it straight.

[01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:09.300]
I'm working on it.

[01:29:09.340 --> 01:29:15.220]
Get the information right with Hank Ron again for just absolutely profusely tinkling all over my shoes.

[01:29:15.940 --> 01:29:16.640]
Broward, hello.

[01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:18.020]
So, Neil.

[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:18.500]
Yeah.

[01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:19.660]
Here's Neil.

[01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:20.700]
Yes, it is.

[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:21.640]
Well, see what?

[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:22.420]
Welcome back.

[01:29:22.820 --> 01:29:23.780]
You were well missed.

[01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:26.180]
I'm sitting here working on this political cartoon.

[01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:28.100]
I just want to invite your input.

[01:29:28.460 --> 01:29:29.260]
Who is this, Tom Wright?

[01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:30.260]
Hello.

[01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:31.960]
Neil.

[01:29:34.700 --> 01:29:37.420]
Now, I'm sitting here looking at this...

[01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:42.580]
It's almost finished, but I wanted to share with you because you may have some dynamite input that would help it.

[01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:42.900]
Yeah.

[01:29:44.860 --> 01:29:49.400]
The background is the shoe line for the early bird of the rest, perhaps.

[01:29:50.180 --> 01:29:54.260]
And standing at your attention is focused on three individuals.

[01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:56.520]
And one of them is a pope.

[01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:59.940]
The second one is leaf-hour.

[01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:04.500]
Kind of with the shoulder turns, you know, counting his cash to make sure he's going to let you have that goes.

[01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:04.960]
Yeah.

[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.660]
And the third person is Ron Jaworski.

[01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:10.580]
Now, the caption reads,

[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:14.480]
leaf-hour takes two pulls at the same time.

[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:17.980]
That's not bad.

[01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:24.760]
Well, I'm not going to make t-shirts, but I thought that, you know, you can be healthy and make it any better.

[01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:25.820]
No, that's perfect.

[01:30:26.260 --> 01:30:29.700]
Good, then let's enjoy the week and stay off the street, man.

[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:30.160]
Okay.

[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:30.860]
Can I be a zoo?

[01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:31.820]
Okay, see you later.

[01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:32.800]
Yeah.

[01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:37.680]
You know, the time up the town for two whole days for a guy in a dress, I keep saying that, but it's just incredible.

[01:30:38.540 --> 01:30:42.880]
I mean, if a guy came into your neighborhood running around with a dress and a beanie on, you'd call a cop.

[01:30:43.060 --> 01:30:44.400]
They'd arrest him immediately, right?

[01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:45.880]
Probably.

[01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:50.260]
There was a guy on the sun set, for example, running around with a dress on and a beanie.

[01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:55.460]
Well, and waving a spear, you know, unbelievable.

[01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:59.980]
You'd think that either he was a metal case or he was on his way to a Santa Rhea ritual in West Highly.

[01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:00.720]
Yeah, one of the other.

[01:31:00.940 --> 01:31:01.940]
And the question about it.

[01:31:01.940 --> 01:31:03.640]
And I'd point him in the direction of Highly.

[01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:04.140]
Okay.

[01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:07.580]
Well, you've been waiting for this for seven weeks.

[01:31:08.020 --> 01:31:09.080]
Seven weeks to go today.

[01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:11.200]
On a Tuesday, no less.

[01:31:12.060 --> 01:31:14.860]
You started this movie review and we're going to finish it.

[01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:16.580]
Well, we start on this radio station.

[01:31:16.580 --> 01:31:17.160]
We finish.

[01:31:17.420 --> 01:31:17.800]
Right.

[01:31:18.220 --> 01:31:19.660]
That's what Bob Gilbertson said.

[01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:20.460]
You're all finished.

[01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:23.360]
But unfortunately, it's time for the news.

[01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:25.000]
Is it unfortunate?

[01:31:25.740 --> 01:31:27.260]
Got a lot of those sick queens out there.

[01:31:27.340 --> 01:31:31.720]
Boy, they just, every time they hear that music, they start with that river phoenix crap again.

[01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:33.700]
You know, this little kiddie's about six years old.

[01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:38.320]
A lot of these pedorists in this audience did Fred Schatz address any of that when he was here?

[01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:40.120]
I mean, try to straighten some of those people out.

[01:31:40.220 --> 01:31:44.800]
So we talked about foot fetishes, but he didn't talk about petrophilia or pedophilia.

[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:45.720]
Petrophilia.

[01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:47.340]
That's fear of petroleum.

[01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:48.560]
Yeah, exactly.

[01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:52.660]
Those are people who are afraid to pick the pedals on Daisy.

[01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:53.120]
Right.

[01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:54.320]
Right.

[01:31:55.620 --> 01:31:58.620]
Or other restorative flowers, which we'll mention in the next hour.

[01:31:58.740 --> 01:32:00.120]
Mike Wolf is back with the headlines.

[01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:05.080]
CBS has the prestigious world news at the top of the hour, minus the whirlpool spot.

[01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:07.000]
And we'll come back in 12 o'clock.

[01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:07.280]

[01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:11.500]
Try to get people to talk about two radio stations after 10 o'clock in the morning.

[01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:13.400]
12 o'clock at the W.I.M.C.

[01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:16.700]
And Michael Jackson seems to be everywhere, isn't he?

[01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:20.420]
He's on the cover of People's Week, which we just got in the mail.

[01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:25.280]
And what was that other thing you were showing me about R and R,

[01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:27.380]
or a favorite publication of Nobody Reads?

[01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:31.820]
And when I was in Rochester, there were all these articles because the album had just come out.

[01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:32.220]
Yeah.

[01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:36.340]
In fact, all the stations in Detroit were playing it and claiming to be the first ones playing it.

[01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:37.280]
Right.

[01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:41.960]
And the questions in the articles were, in fact, every article said basically the same thing.

[01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:45.440]
The album is good, but what about the way he looks?

[01:32:47.900 --> 01:32:48.380]
Yeah.

[01:32:50.340 --> 01:32:52.620]
What about the way he looks?

[01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:54.040]
He looks like a mannequin.

[01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:54.880]
He doesn't look real.

[01:32:55.560 --> 01:33:02.860]
And all the black kids in Rochester that they interviewed said we don't want to be identified with him because he looks a little too swishy for us.

[01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:04.080]
Do you know what I'm saying?

[01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:06.380]
Do you believe he's proposed to Elizabeth Taylor?

[01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:08.140]
Have you heard that proposed what?

[01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:11.860]
Marriage. Have you heard that proposed what, exactly?

[01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:14.480]
What are they going to do? Rub their jewels together?

[01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:18.100]
He has a shrine to her in his house. Did you hear that?

[01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:18.660]
Really.

[01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:22.580]
And he has a big screen TV that runs Elizabeth Taylor movies 24 hours a day.

[01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:23.780]
Do you hear all that?

[01:33:23.860 --> 01:33:24.580]
Well, he's in the bubble.

[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:25.060]
Yeah.

[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:29.860]
Well, he's in the tank with the oxyb with Michael Jackson glove.

[01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:34.080]
And all it says in this two-page color full-color ad in Arnari,

[01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:36.720]
all it says is bad Michael Jackson.

[01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:37.040]
Yeah.

[01:33:38.340 --> 01:33:39.480]
He'd be bad.

[01:33:39.740 --> 01:33:39.880]
He'd be bad.

[01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:40.920]
Yeah, he'd be bad.

[01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:42.120]
I'd be bad.

[01:33:42.460 --> 01:33:43.280]
Three words in the whole world.

[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:44.120]
I'd be real bad.

[01:33:46.300 --> 01:33:47.640]
Yeah, the album's okay.

[01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:48.540]
Is it?

[01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:49.240]
Yeah.

[01:33:49.540 --> 01:33:50.360]
It's not blurry.

[01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:52.760]
Yeah, I've heard the title doesn't what?

[01:33:55.640 --> 01:33:56.740]
What did he say?

[01:33:57.160 --> 01:33:59.700]
No, I think that could have been actionable what he just said.

[01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:00.600]
Don't you?

[01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:03.760]
How'd you like to be the sidekick on a Joey Pinto show?

[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:06.920]
Oh, don't even kid about that.

[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:08.440]
Don't even joke around.

[01:34:08.540 --> 01:34:10.780]
And you know the Pinto is like one step away from an Edsel.

[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:12.460]
Is that what they always said?

[01:34:14.020 --> 01:34:15.900]
And I want to thank the people at the wave,

[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:17.860]
even though I haven't read it yet,

[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:22.800]
but look at that on the front cover with a big drawing or whatever that is.

[01:34:22.860 --> 01:34:23.660]
Nice, so drawing.

[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:24.660]
Very nice.

[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:26.120]
Off the air with Neil Rogers.

[01:34:26.300 --> 01:34:29.500]
And also the Pompano Ledger, man, we have made it.

[01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:30.860]
We've made it.

[01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:31.520]
Okay.

[01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:36.080]
Screw the Harold and all these other nickel and dime publications.

[01:34:36.420 --> 01:34:37.520]
Pompano Ledger.

[01:34:37.580 --> 01:34:38.080]
But the Broward?

[01:34:39.260 --> 01:34:40.260]
What was it?

[01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:41.360]
The Pompano Ledger.

[01:34:41.380 --> 01:34:42.080]
No, the other one first.

[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:43.060]
Oh, the Broward Review.

[01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:43.800]

[01:34:44.100 --> 01:34:44.220]
Yeah.

[01:34:45.100 --> 01:34:49.100]
And now the Pompano Ledger lead editorial.

[01:34:51.140 --> 01:34:53.080]
Shock Radio has an audience.

[01:34:54.820 --> 01:34:56.640]
Ooh, I like that remembering Buddy.

[01:34:56.980 --> 01:34:58.780]
It's a biography of Buddy Holly.

[01:34:59.120 --> 01:34:59.300]
Yeah.

[01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:04.960]
I'm going to play you somebody Holly on the stand major show today, by the way.

[01:35:05.380 --> 01:35:06.220]
That'll be different.

[01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:07.000]
That'll be the day.

[01:35:08.220 --> 01:35:12.200]
Last week, Neil Rogers of WINC AM began battling with a listener from this area

[01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:15.560]
who apparently disagrees with Roger Shock Radio format.

[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:17.000]
Thank you, Charlie.

[01:35:17.100 --> 01:35:17.440]
I hate me.

[01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:18.560]
I hear what Canada did this morning.

[01:35:18.660 --> 01:35:19.720]
Are you here with Rick and Sidesdale?

[01:35:19.860 --> 01:35:20.840]
Are you here with Duelogit?

[01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:26.380]
Rogers claimed that the listeners had formed a group that contacted WINC's advertisers

[01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:28.800]
and urged them to stop supporting the program.

[01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:33.020]
If the protester believed that the Neil Rogers program is juvenile,

[01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:38.620]
scatter logical, leering, and dripping with sexual innuendo, we agree.

[01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:45.380]
On the other hand, tens, if not hundreds of thousands, choose to listen in.

[01:35:46.180 --> 01:35:50.340]
And the simple fact is Rogers is dominating the radio business with his approach.

[01:35:51.060 --> 01:35:52.820]
You may find it ugly or wonderful.

[01:35:53.300 --> 01:35:54.020]
That is your right.

[01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:58.560]
It is also Rogers' right to continue, and it is a right that must be protected

[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:00.440]
regardless of personal preference.

[01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:03.540]
Makes sense.

[01:36:03.540 --> 01:36:05.900]
What the hell are you doing over there just opening the mail?

[01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:07.300]
Like a frantic animal.

[01:36:08.140 --> 01:36:12.800]
The desire to dominate and control the thinking of others is an all-too-common human failing.

[01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:17.000]
In the 1950s, this nation went through an ugly period of McCarthyism

[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:21.620]
that left a stain on the noble efforts of a generation that risked all to fight Nazism.

[01:36:22.620 --> 01:36:27.100]
In the 1980s, more subtle efforts by anti-war interests to suppress films

[01:36:27.100 --> 01:36:30.580]
that deal with the treatment of POWs by America's enemies in Vietnam

[01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:35.220]
has stained the efforts of those legitimately opposed to war and national violence.

[01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:42.760]
The founders of this nation wisely allowed for divergent beliefs, opinions, attitudes, and philosophies,

[01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:46.720]
they clearly understood that majority rule could easily become enslavement of the minority.

[01:36:47.860 --> 01:36:54.040]
Such suppression would inevitably breed revolution under the destruction of the American democratic experiment.

[01:36:54.960 --> 01:37:03.020]
Under our system, the best yet devised by our tumultuous species, species, species, it is important.

[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:05.900]
What are you doing over there?

[01:37:05.980 --> 01:37:07.940]
The man is just totally in a dream world.

[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:11.160]
I could throw any word in here and it doesn't make any difference.

[01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:12.300]
I'm listening to every word you say.

[01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:13.880]
I could have said it's a good time for the great pace.

[01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:15.840]
I'm listening to every word you say.

[01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:21.880]
The best yet devised by our tumultuous species, it is important to remember that the opinions of others need not be honored

[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:27.640]
but they must be protected from those seeking to silence them if we are to continue as a free nation.

[01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:31.120]
I agree.

[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:31.400]

[01:37:31.420 --> 01:37:32.500]
From the pompano ledger.

[01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:35.500]
I heard your word.

[01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:36.120]
Excellent.

[01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:39.280]
Look at this letter I got and be sure to read the last thing in it.

[01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:42.840]
The word Lynn, Tampa Radio Talk News, WPLP.

[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:47.100]
David Fowler is described as a manic depressive but is considered very nice.

[01:37:47.620 --> 01:37:50.500]
Jack Wheeler receives a lot of negative comments.

[01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:57.340]
Rick Marin, who's summarized to him as moron, is the new kid on the block replacing Bob Lasseter.

[01:37:58.120 --> 01:38:02.120]
Joey Reynolds is playing the I-95 song on WSHG.

[01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:05.800]
He's playing the I-95 asshole record?

[01:38:06.300 --> 01:38:10.460]
I also heard he was playing the Beach Boys LA but I have not heard either one of those.

[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:11.600]
How can he do that?

[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:12.720]
I don't know.

[01:38:18.620 --> 01:38:22.300]
But that's what we had a caller say that to us last week.

[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:26.280]
And now we get a letter that says he's playing the I-95 song.

[01:38:26.380 --> 01:38:26.740]
I don't know.

[01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:29.700]
Just reports.

[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:37.800]
Well, we took our daddy's phone up and we headed for the Hollywood freeway.

[01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:44.200]
But we hit a lot of traffic and got stuck in a two-hour delay.

[01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:51.000]
So we pulled out our pistols and we dealt with the traffic in a new way.

[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:57.100]
We used our guns, guns, guns when we're driving down the streets of the lane.

[01:38:58.180 --> 01:38:59.800]
We're driving down the streets of the lane.

[01:39:03.670 --> 01:39:08.630]
And when I drive around I go out shooting people's dead.

[01:39:10.870 --> 01:39:16.010]
I come back late at night with my fingers all splattered red.

[01:39:17.810 --> 01:39:20.890]
And we all underline the most.

[01:39:21.250 --> 01:39:22.090]
It's the middle.

[01:39:22.230 --> 01:39:24.230]
And I'm driving on the floor.

[01:39:24.230 --> 01:39:29.850]
I want to shoot a Honda blast to bat off of the road.

[01:39:32.570 --> 01:39:35.670]
With my handgun shoot, shoot, a Honda.

[01:39:36.190 --> 01:39:39.110]
Shoot, shoot, shoot, a Honda.

[01:39:39.530 --> 01:39:41.390]
Shoot, a Honda, yeah.

[01:39:41.770 --> 01:39:43.850]
blast it off of the road.

[01:39:47.470 --> 01:39:53.110]
This everybody had a man, all across the lane.

[01:39:53.790 --> 01:39:59.890]
It all be pulling their guns out on the old freeway.

[01:40:00.410 --> 01:40:03.330]
It's be firing a few weeks.

[01:40:04.170 --> 01:40:05.950]
For some share of the lanes.

[01:40:07.130 --> 01:40:09.170]
Everybody's going crazy.

[01:40:10.210 --> 01:40:12.490]
Driving in a lane.

[01:40:13.770 --> 01:40:14.670]
I think you're fired.

[01:40:16.170 --> 01:40:17.730]
Do I know Jerry Clifton?

[01:40:17.930 --> 01:40:18.550]
Yeah. No.

[01:40:20.370 --> 01:40:22.110]
Do you know Jerry Clifton?

[01:40:22.230 --> 01:40:23.030]
Yeah. Obviously.

[01:40:23.250 --> 01:40:25.170]
It's be the PD of 96X.

[01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:26.430]
Who cares?

[01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:28.630]
What about him?

[01:40:28.770 --> 01:40:31.710]
He just saw his picture here with, you know Buzz Bennett?

[01:40:32.250 --> 01:40:32.470]
Yeah.

[01:40:33.210 --> 01:40:39.150]
Buzz looks like he's been buzzed a few times too many years ago.

[01:40:39.150 --> 01:40:40.870]
Yeah. Looks like he's been hanging around with Roby Young.

[01:40:40.970 --> 01:40:43.450]
Yeah. What about him?

[01:40:44.370 --> 01:40:47.150]
This is the audience care about these in things.

[01:40:47.950 --> 01:40:50.110]
All of these radio people have nobody ever heard of before.

[01:40:50.270 --> 01:40:51.230]
Nobody wants to hear of?

[01:40:51.470 --> 01:40:51.610]
Yeah.

[01:40:52.110 --> 01:40:52.330]
Okay.

[01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:54.370]
Dave County. Hello.

[01:40:54.770 --> 01:40:55.610]
Hi. How are you?

[01:40:56.030 --> 01:40:56.530]
Is it clear?

[01:40:56.810 --> 01:40:57.170]
Yes sir.

[01:40:57.410 --> 01:40:58.490]
Hi. I'm a six time caller.

[01:40:58.570 --> 01:40:59.270]
You know I'm nervous.

[01:40:59.530 --> 01:40:59.810]
Okay.

[01:41:00.130 --> 01:41:00.410]
Okay.

[01:41:00.550 --> 01:41:00.730]
Anyway.

[01:41:01.510 --> 01:41:02.450]
How was your trip?

[01:41:02.450 --> 01:41:03.070]
Okay.

[01:41:03.210 --> 01:41:04.090]
Oh, that's great.

[01:41:04.370 --> 01:41:05.550]
Oh, anyway. I wanted to tell you.

[01:41:05.690 --> 01:41:07.070]
My ex-wife did look like the Pope.

[01:41:08.890 --> 01:41:09.810]
Does that make any sense?

[01:41:10.190 --> 01:41:12.030]
I was her dress as big as his was.

[01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:13.950]
I think it was a loose shorter.

[01:41:14.170 --> 01:41:14.430]
Okay.

[01:41:14.870 --> 01:41:17.030]
Anyway, the other day I was going down this came Boulevard, right?

[01:41:17.690 --> 01:41:19.470]
And I ran into his, uh, the square.

[01:41:19.630 --> 01:41:20.230]
Am I allowed to say that?

[01:41:20.630 --> 01:41:20.970]
No.

[01:41:21.310 --> 01:41:22.090]
Oh, okay.

[01:41:22.310 --> 01:41:22.630]
Okay.

[01:41:23.130 --> 01:41:24.290]
I guess you must have been full.

[01:41:24.630 --> 01:41:25.130]
Anyway, look.

[01:41:25.270 --> 01:41:28.170]
You have a good matchman talking about that.

[01:41:28.470 --> 01:41:29.650]
That non-sequitance.

[01:41:30.290 --> 01:41:30.290]

[01:41:30.290 --> 01:41:30.990]
That's great.

[01:41:31.750 --> 01:41:32.570]
I'll see you around, Neil.

[01:41:32.810 --> 01:41:33.810]
Okay. Thanks a lot, Tom.

[01:41:33.850 --> 01:41:35.470]
There's Tom Likis calling in from Phoenix.

[01:41:36.250 --> 01:41:37.370]
Let's go to a Broward.

[01:41:37.410 --> 01:41:37.610]
Hello.

[01:41:38.010 --> 01:41:38.210]
Neil.

[01:41:38.570 --> 01:41:39.010]
Yes sir.

[01:41:39.090 --> 01:41:39.750]
Good to have you back.

[01:41:40.010 --> 01:41:40.950]
Thank you so much.

[01:41:41.070 --> 01:41:45.790]
I know you're depressed this day with hearing from the last day and, uh, going to call

[01:41:45.790 --> 01:41:47.230]
you everything, but there was a group.

[01:41:47.330 --> 01:41:48.690]
There was more depressed than you, Saturday.

[01:41:49.210 --> 01:41:49.630]
Who's that?

[01:41:49.890 --> 01:41:50.530]
The Gator fans.

[01:41:51.990 --> 01:41:52.390]
Good.

[01:41:53.570 --> 01:41:53.970]
Good.

[01:41:54.450 --> 01:41:56.610]
Uh, say, we were at the game.

[01:41:56.830 --> 01:41:57.690]
We were having a good time.

[01:41:57.690 --> 01:41:59.290]
That's where I'll mind me, people.

[01:42:00.050 --> 01:42:02.790]
And about eight minutes ago, they were all leaving the stadium.

[01:42:03.830 --> 01:42:05.570]
And they were at the press group.

[01:42:06.030 --> 01:42:06.350]
Really?

[01:42:06.590 --> 01:42:06.770]
Yes.

[01:42:07.190 --> 01:42:09.010]
And really, really so bad for them.

[01:42:09.310 --> 01:42:13.610]
Well, anybody from Gainesville or anybody who spent, you know, more than ten days in Gainesville

[01:42:13.610 --> 01:42:14.870]
deserves what they get, you know?

[01:42:15.730 --> 01:42:19.530]
It's because they can't go on paint guys 100,000 a year to play football in college.

[01:42:19.850 --> 01:42:20.690]
What can I tell you?

[01:42:21.230 --> 01:42:21.870]
I'll tell you.

[01:42:22.190 --> 01:42:25.190]
You know, the brown teeth and all, you know, it was a good fun shoot.

[01:42:25.230 --> 01:42:26.670]
I just just put you back to the seat up there.

[01:42:26.670 --> 01:42:27.370]
You bet.

[01:42:27.490 --> 01:42:28.670]
They were really cocky before.

[01:42:28.830 --> 01:42:29.430]
Did you say that?

[01:42:29.630 --> 01:42:29.830]
No.

[01:42:30.030 --> 01:42:30.450]
Oh, okay.

[01:42:30.870 --> 01:42:33.630]
But, uh, it feels a lot of fun.

[01:42:33.710 --> 01:42:36.270]
So, I know you're depressionist, but you couldn't compare it to theirs.

[01:42:36.810 --> 01:42:37.650]
I know you're wrong.

[01:42:38.030 --> 01:42:38.710]
I know you're wrong.

[01:42:38.970 --> 01:42:43.910]
I mean, to plunge your brains out and call her to just, and then to get beaten up by, by a nostril.

[01:42:44.390 --> 01:42:44.550]
Yeah.

[01:42:44.550 --> 01:42:48.390]
It was great perfect and have some listener who doesn't know a horse from a donkey.

[01:42:48.750 --> 01:42:51.530]
He would have been on the lead pony if they would have put a number on it.

[01:42:51.530 --> 01:42:55.770]
And a guy comes up and he caches the trifecta in the same race for $1,100.

[01:42:56.530 --> 01:43:01.470]
Well, I was a coller about, oh, the first week or so of August.

[01:43:02.170 --> 01:43:04.250]
Last time I was down there, I've been there in two years.

[01:43:04.510 --> 01:43:04.650]
Yeah.

[01:43:05.090 --> 01:43:06.990]
So, I decided what the heck.

[01:43:07.490 --> 01:43:11.130]
I don't know the horses, but decided to bet everything in lower pain or road.

[01:43:11.690 --> 01:43:12.150]
Oh, boy.

[01:43:12.810 --> 01:43:14.450]
And she was hot that day.

[01:43:14.610 --> 01:43:14.890]
Really?

[01:43:15.150 --> 01:43:15.810]
She was hot.

[01:43:15.970 --> 01:43:16.930]
That was the day, yeah.

[01:43:16.930 --> 01:43:21.330]
I bet, I think, for a combination she was on.

[01:43:21.890 --> 01:43:24.910]
What did she do right them all in the front, about 10 lengths in front?

[01:43:25.110 --> 01:43:25.630]
No, no, no.

[01:43:25.790 --> 01:43:26.770]
Hang on for desperation.

[01:43:27.430 --> 01:43:28.350]
She came from behind.

[01:43:28.570 --> 01:43:31.750]
She was whipping the heck out of those horses coming to the stretch.

[01:43:31.970 --> 01:43:32.190]
Really?

[01:43:32.570 --> 01:43:36.070]
I was really surprised and she made me happy that day.

[01:43:36.190 --> 01:43:36.590]
That's for sure.

[01:43:36.690 --> 01:43:37.550]
Laurie made you happy.

[01:43:37.690 --> 01:43:39.610]
Well, we don't want to get out of that, sir, but...

[01:43:41.670 --> 01:43:42.870]
Okay, Neil, good having you back.

[01:43:43.010 --> 01:43:43.430]
Thanks a lot.

[01:43:43.630 --> 01:43:45.090]
Now, call her is my favorite track.

[01:43:45.210 --> 01:43:45.950]
I love it out there.

[01:43:45.950 --> 01:43:50.070]
I love the ambiance and the food and Martha up there and Jimmy at the ice cream stand.

[01:43:50.210 --> 01:43:54.130]
All my good friends at Coulter, but they'll have to understand that...

[01:43:55.770 --> 01:43:56.470]
It's audio.

[01:43:56.810 --> 01:43:59.910]
In fact, I wrote on my program yesterday, I showed it to Bill Coulter.

[01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:03.570]
I wrote the audio handicap over the last race.

[01:44:03.750 --> 01:44:04.830]
And it was, believe me.

[01:44:05.590 --> 01:44:09.170]
In fact, Baldazar and the One Horse, they bet him down in the double, something fierce.

[01:44:10.070 --> 01:44:11.230]
And he's still running.

[01:44:11.530 --> 01:44:12.270]
Chuck is still running.

[01:44:12.470 --> 01:44:15.230]
I guess he only tries hard on Sunday because he's born again.

[01:44:15.230 --> 01:44:16.050]
Now he got religion.

[01:44:16.850 --> 01:44:20.310]
And he rides for the Lord on Sunday, but never on a Monday, never on Labor Day.

[01:44:21.210 --> 01:44:25.590]
And the only race where he even came close to getting arrested was that one race where he beat me.

[01:44:25.670 --> 01:44:29.730]
I don't want to keep mentioning it again again, but beat Mike Gonzalez by a nose...

[01:44:29.730 --> 01:44:30.410]
16th of a day.

[01:44:30.410 --> 01:44:32.950]
For a second, it had to be a 410 perfect day.

[01:44:33.150 --> 01:44:33.790]
It had to be.

[01:44:35.570 --> 01:44:36.670]
Couldn't possibly miss.

[01:44:38.110 --> 01:44:38.850]
And it did.

[01:44:39.250 --> 01:44:42.730]
And the Lord heard Chuck's prayer on the rail there in the deep stretch.

[01:44:43.450 --> 01:44:45.090]
And he... unbelievable.

[01:44:45.610 --> 01:44:51.570]
And Michael Lee, I don't want to dwell on it, Michael, but to get serious, take up a real profession.

[01:44:51.710 --> 01:44:52.650]
Go do something honest.

[01:44:53.790 --> 01:44:54.410]
Broward, hello.

[01:44:55.090 --> 01:44:55.290]
Neil?

[01:44:55.610 --> 01:44:55.790]
Yeah.

[01:44:56.210 --> 01:44:57.990]
So tell me, where can I get the best bagels?

[01:44:58.550 --> 01:45:00.810]
Yeah, we're going to do that for Moon to 2, I think.

[01:45:01.310 --> 01:45:01.870]
And Bill?

[01:45:02.290 --> 01:45:05.090]
And Bill, are you trying to euthanize all your loyal listeners?

[01:45:05.710 --> 01:45:06.990]
What have I got to do with it?

[01:45:07.110 --> 01:45:07.930]
My God!

[01:45:08.210 --> 01:45:11.630]
As a matter of fact, I was in the car listening Sunday when he was taking his poll.

[01:45:11.630 --> 01:45:15.190]
And I was frantically trying to find a pay phone so I could call in and vote for him.

[01:45:15.190 --> 01:45:15.970]
I couldn't find one.

[01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:16.910]
Unbelievable.

[01:45:18.390 --> 01:45:19.890]
They don't have any phones at the track.

[01:45:20.410 --> 01:45:20.590]
No.

[01:45:20.710 --> 01:45:22.190]
Neil, one thing, and then I got to go.

[01:45:22.450 --> 01:45:22.750]
Okay.

[01:45:23.050 --> 01:45:27.150]
Did you hear that IBM has a new typewriter, the presidential selectric?

[01:45:28.830 --> 01:45:30.130]
You know what its features are?

[01:45:30.770 --> 01:45:31.450]
Go ahead, sir.

[01:45:31.970 --> 01:45:33.730]
It has no memory and no colon.

[01:45:37.590 --> 01:45:38.190]
Not bad.

[01:45:38.330 --> 01:45:40.150]
I'll tell I went to the Pope when we see him on Thursday.

[01:45:40.150 --> 01:45:41.030]
Okay, Neil.

[01:45:41.190 --> 01:45:41.450]
See ya.

[01:45:41.770 --> 01:45:42.070]
Thank you.

[01:45:42.110 --> 01:45:43.830]
That's a good connection on that line, wasn't it?

[01:45:43.930 --> 01:45:44.130]
Mm-hmm.

[01:45:44.550 --> 01:45:45.990]
I was that because of the new phone system?

[01:45:46.690 --> 01:45:46.970]
No.

[01:45:47.570 --> 01:45:48.370]
Punch that up again.

[01:45:48.530 --> 01:45:49.410]
Now, what is it, 71?

[01:45:49.950 --> 01:45:50.210]
Mm-hmm.

[01:45:51.090 --> 01:45:51.750]
I like this.

[01:45:51.870 --> 01:45:52.550]
This is a lot of fun.

[01:45:53.330 --> 01:45:55.470]
Drive him crazy out there in the A3O.

[01:45:56.650 --> 01:45:58.070]
It's too bad we don't have reverb.

[01:45:58.310 --> 01:45:59.330]
We could do an old echo chamber.

[01:45:59.650 --> 01:45:59.750]
Hi, Nell.

[01:46:00.450 --> 01:46:01.910]
Are they using that synthesizer?

[01:46:02.290 --> 01:46:03.290]
Has it a cloney FM?

[01:46:04.010 --> 01:46:04.410]
I don't know.

[01:46:04.930 --> 01:46:05.450]
Did it click in?

[01:46:05.450 --> 01:46:06.070]
I don't think so.

[01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:07.050]
Let me try it again.

[01:46:07.230 --> 01:46:07.570]
Try it again.

[01:46:11.010 --> 01:46:11.970]
Come on.

[01:46:13.490 --> 01:46:14.830]
Did they unhook it already?

[01:46:15.030 --> 01:46:16.050]
They unhook it already?

[01:46:16.610 --> 01:46:17.710]
What do you mean they unhooked it?

[01:46:18.310 --> 01:46:19.450]
Here comes a message.

[01:46:20.770 --> 01:46:21.910]
Yes, you are on.

[01:46:22.510 --> 01:46:23.410]
Oh, it's working now.

[01:46:23.610 --> 01:46:24.070]
It doesn't do anything.

[01:46:24.990 --> 01:46:25.670]
You're on.

[01:46:26.230 --> 01:46:29.230]
Bob Gilbertson, please report to AM Control.

[01:46:30.030 --> 01:46:32.370]
Bob Gilbertson, please report immediately.

[01:46:33.430 --> 01:46:34.090]
That's good.

[01:46:34.170 --> 01:46:34.650]
I like that.

[01:46:35.910 --> 01:46:37.190]
That thing is fun.

[01:46:37.950 --> 01:46:38.650]
That was great.

[01:46:38.770 --> 01:46:40.330]
We can use that.

[01:46:40.450 --> 01:46:42.390]
We can have a good audience out there in the A3O.

[01:46:42.390 --> 01:46:43.890]
We've got a whole lot of people work here.

[01:46:44.770 --> 01:46:46.530]
I like the fact that you were on and we didn't know.

[01:46:47.050 --> 01:46:48.410]
Let me put that a different way.

[01:46:48.490 --> 01:46:50.270]
We've got a lot of people on the payroll here.

[01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:51.670]
Let's not get carried away.

[01:46:52.090 --> 01:46:52.090]

[01:46:52.330 --> 01:46:54.130]
22 past noon at WINZ.

[01:46:54.270 --> 01:46:56.410]
I'm Joey Pinto and we'll come back right after this.

[01:47:00.310 --> 01:47:00.710]
Hello.

[01:47:01.190 --> 01:47:02.330]
This is Michael Jackson.

[01:47:03.010 --> 01:47:05.350]
Urgent you to help stop the spread of social disease.

[01:47:05.350 --> 01:47:09.610]
Don't risk your life by having a romantic encounter with an unfamiliar coins.

[01:47:10.330 --> 01:47:11.770]
I urge you to do like I do.

[01:47:12.210 --> 01:47:12.830]
Go it alone.

[01:47:13.370 --> 01:47:14.790]
But make sure you wear protection.

[01:47:15.390 --> 01:47:17.790]
That's why I recommend the Michael Jackson glove.

[01:47:18.470 --> 01:47:24.030]
Worn on either hand, the Michael Jackson glove adds the security and peace of mind that I need to do it myself.

[01:47:24.890 --> 01:47:28.350]
So remember, before you pour it out, put it on and...

[01:47:30.790 --> 01:47:32.390]
The Michael Jackson glove.

[01:47:32.390 --> 01:47:35.930]
Proving once again that a bird in the hand is better than one in the bush.

[01:47:36.070 --> 01:47:38.510]
A better than sequin models for extra stimulation.

[01:47:38.950 --> 01:47:40.910]
That's the kind of stuff that we strive for.

[01:47:41.010 --> 01:47:43.870]
We spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to try and make that happen.

[01:47:44.270 --> 01:47:46.170]
Okay, 25 past noon.

[01:47:48.270 --> 01:47:51.510]
That's why you don't see too many of the gloves around town are pretty expensive, right?

[01:47:51.690 --> 01:47:52.010]
Mm-hmm.

[01:47:52.190 --> 01:47:52.570]
Unbelievable.

[01:47:53.190 --> 01:47:56.630]
Anyway, the wave was very kind and I thank them for all the nice things they didn't.

[01:47:56.710 --> 01:47:59.850]
They quoted me accurately evidently and they never stole a freight train.

[01:47:59.970 --> 01:48:01.170]
So congratulations to them.

[01:48:02.950 --> 01:48:05.010]
And you know, I was thinking about Michael Jackson.

[01:48:05.110 --> 01:48:06.870]
Would you ever want to run into him in a dark alley?

[01:48:07.550 --> 01:48:07.730]
Me.

[01:48:09.570 --> 01:48:09.950]
No.

[01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.250]
No.

[01:48:10.270 --> 01:48:10.270]

[01:48:11.730 --> 01:48:13.850]
That could be our poll question in the one o'clock hour.

[01:48:14.730 --> 01:48:16.850]
Would you want to run into Michael in a dark alley?

[01:48:17.730 --> 01:48:19.290]
No, we need to take more polls.

[01:48:19.590 --> 01:48:21.070]
The city is going through withdrawals.

[01:48:21.070 --> 01:48:21.750]
He'd be bad.

[01:48:22.010 --> 01:48:22.290]
Since leaves.

[01:48:22.290 --> 01:48:23.130]
He'd be real bad.

[01:48:24.230 --> 01:48:26.810]
Especially with that new leather look.

[01:48:27.450 --> 01:48:27.690]
Yeah.

[01:48:27.690 --> 01:48:30.550]
I'm going to get a little kinkier as each day goes by.

[01:48:30.730 --> 01:48:31.190]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:48:31.710 --> 01:48:34.250]
I've got a few more studs as each day goes by.

[01:48:35.130 --> 01:48:36.810]
Let's go to Broward.

[01:48:36.890 --> 01:48:37.070]
Hello.

[01:48:38.650 --> 01:48:39.090]
Hello.

[01:48:39.770 --> 01:48:40.810]
Is there someone there?

[01:48:41.010 --> 01:48:41.390]
Can you tell?

[01:48:41.810 --> 01:48:42.050]
No.

[01:48:42.210 --> 01:48:42.850]
Nobody there.

[01:48:43.050 --> 01:48:43.770]
I can tell.

[01:48:43.990 --> 01:48:44.830]
Can you tell?

[01:48:45.070 --> 01:48:45.270]
No.

[01:48:45.510 --> 01:48:45.810]
Not yet.

[01:48:46.150 --> 01:48:47.290]
Put you up on that phone.

[01:48:47.650 --> 01:48:47.850]
Hello.

[01:48:48.510 --> 01:48:49.550]
Hi, Neil.

[01:48:49.810 --> 01:48:50.190]
How are you doing?

[01:48:50.750 --> 01:48:51.390]
Pretty good.

[01:48:53.070 --> 01:48:56.530]
Neil, have the policy be told you you can't pick on the Pope?

[01:48:56.990 --> 01:48:57.390]
No.

[01:48:58.070 --> 01:48:59.290]
How come you're doing it?

[01:48:59.370 --> 01:49:00.330]
You only got a couple days.

[01:49:00.810 --> 01:49:02.790]
I was hoping for a medley of the greatest hits.

[01:49:03.030 --> 01:49:04.730]
Tom, layer of Vatican, Reagan, all.

[01:49:06.070 --> 01:49:07.730]
You want us to pick on the Pope?

[01:49:07.970 --> 01:49:08.150]
Oh.

[01:49:08.370 --> 01:49:09.570]
On the Holy Father?

[01:49:09.750 --> 01:49:10.190]
I know.

[01:49:10.350 --> 01:49:11.010]
That's all we hear.

[01:49:11.010 --> 01:49:12.510]
What kind of degenerate are you?

[01:49:13.110 --> 01:49:14.890]
I'm pretty degenerate, Neil.

[01:49:15.290 --> 01:49:16.170]
I got to admit it.

[01:49:16.350 --> 01:49:16.910]
Shame on you.

[01:49:17.050 --> 01:49:21.190]
Don't you understand that the very least you'll spend ten years in purgatory

[01:49:21.190 --> 01:49:22.510]
if you keep this kind of talka?

[01:49:22.710 --> 01:49:23.410]
I'm willing.

[01:49:23.730 --> 01:49:24.790]
For a good laugh today.

[01:49:25.110 --> 01:49:25.370]
Okay.

[01:49:25.370 --> 01:49:25.930]
I'm willing.

[01:49:26.350 --> 01:49:26.970]
Yeah, for that.

[01:49:27.230 --> 01:49:27.530]
Okay.

[01:50:02.250 --> 01:50:02.850]
Yeah.

[01:50:03.590 --> 01:50:03.710]
Yeah.

[01:50:13.510 --> 01:50:13.510]

[01:50:13.530 --> 01:50:13.530]

[01:50:13.570 --> 01:50:13.570]

[01:50:13.570 --> 01:50:13.570]

[01:50:13.570 --> 01:50:13.570]

[01:50:15.890 --> 01:50:15.890]

[01:50:15.890 --> 01:50:15.890]

[01:50:15.890 --> 01:50:15.890]

[01:50:15.890 --> 01:50:16.150]
Yeah.

[01:50:17.250 --> 01:50:17.850]
Yeah.

[01:50:17.850 --> 01:50:17.850]

[01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:17.950]

[01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:17.950]

[01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:17.950]

[01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:17.950]

[01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:17.950]

[01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:17.950]

[01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:17.950]

[01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:17.950]

[01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:17.950]

[01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:17.950]

[01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:17.950]

[01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:17.950]

[01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:17.950]

[01:50:18.210 --> 01:50:18.490]
Yeah.

[01:50:22.710 --> 01:50:22.810]
Yeah.

[01:50:29.950 --> 01:50:32.230]
Okay.

[01:50:32.230 --> 01:50:32.750]
Let's say they'll fix the ceremony again.

[01:50:40.210 --> 01:50:44.770]
Well done.

[01:50:45.910 --> 01:50:52.790]
You have enough energy, great.

[01:50:52.790 --> 01:50:52.790]

[01:50:52.790 --> 01:50:52.790]

[01:50:52.790 --> 01:50:52.790]

[01:50:52.790 --> 01:50:52.790]

[01:50:52.790 --> 01:50:52.790]

[01:50:52.790 --> 01:50:52.790]

[01:50:52.790 --> 01:50:52.790]

[01:50:52.790 --> 01:50:52.790]

[01:50:52.790 --> 01:50:52.790]

[01:50:52.790 --> 01:50:55.050]
All right. You think that he's gonna have a Sony Walkman

[01:50:55.410 --> 01:50:56.950]
in the motorcade positive?

[01:50:57.190 --> 01:50:59.010]
And the archbishop will give him a little nudge.

[01:50:59.150 --> 01:50:59.810]
You know, a little elbow?

[01:51:00.110 --> 01:51:01.410]
Yeah. A little friendly nudge.

[01:51:02.190 --> 01:51:03.550]
Very touchy, you know, those priests.

[01:51:03.610 --> 01:51:05.450]
They like to feel a little bit in touch.

[01:51:05.770 --> 01:51:08.190]
And they'll say, wait till you listen to this, you know?

[01:51:08.530 --> 01:51:10.390]
And then of course, you'll have all these terrible things

[01:51:10.390 --> 01:51:12.310]
to say about me, the archbishop is usual.

[01:51:12.830 --> 01:51:14.430]
But he gets off on this show.

[01:51:14.470 --> 01:51:15.490]
He really does. He loves it.

[01:51:15.870 --> 01:51:17.770]
There's another copy of the Miami Review.

[01:51:17.830 --> 01:51:18.290]
You're right.

[01:51:18.770 --> 01:51:21.790]
It's in both the Broward Review and the Miami Review.

[01:51:21.790 --> 01:51:23.370]
So I have been exonerated.

[01:51:23.450 --> 01:51:25.590]
Boy, we apologize.

[01:51:26.050 --> 01:51:26.570]
Thank you.

[01:51:26.790 --> 01:51:27.470]
And take it back.

[01:51:27.570 --> 01:51:29.490]
We retract everything we said about you

[01:51:29.490 --> 01:51:30.810]
and then multiplied by 10.

[01:51:30.930 --> 01:51:31.350]
Everything?

[01:51:31.910 --> 01:51:32.130]
Almost.

[01:51:32.790 --> 01:51:33.310]
Ooh, look at that.

[01:51:33.370 --> 01:51:35.170]
I got two of them punched down at the same time.

[01:51:35.570 --> 01:51:36.550]
Great. You think that'll work?

[01:51:37.070 --> 01:51:37.430]
Sure.

[01:51:37.790 --> 01:51:37.930]
No.

[01:51:38.310 --> 01:51:38.730]
Hello.

[01:51:39.150 --> 01:51:39.490]
Hello.

[01:51:39.970 --> 01:51:40.190]
Yes?

[01:51:40.510 --> 01:51:40.790]
Roger.

[01:51:41.510 --> 01:51:41.950]
Hello.

[01:51:42.470 --> 01:51:42.650]
Hello.

[01:51:44.010 --> 01:51:44.470]
It's you.

[01:51:44.470 --> 01:51:44.730]
I know.

[01:51:45.250 --> 01:51:45.890]
So, yes.

[01:51:46.250 --> 01:51:46.570]
I know.

[01:51:47.110 --> 01:51:48.510]
Welcome back. Good to hear you.

[01:51:48.810 --> 01:51:49.310]
Thank you.

[01:51:49.550 --> 01:51:50.970]
You know why you lost it to track?

[01:51:50.970 --> 01:51:52.170]
Why is that?

[01:51:52.250 --> 01:51:54.530]
No one had called you to tell you that last Wednesday.

[01:51:54.770 --> 01:51:56.510]
And somebody had called in the state

[01:51:56.510 --> 01:51:59.770]
told the wee person with you the other day on the phone.

[01:51:59.990 --> 01:52:02.250]
I was listening that they had a month

[01:52:02.250 --> 01:52:04.430]
being you speaking on the telephone on the radio.

[01:52:04.890 --> 01:52:06.710]
On the other some other radio stations.

[01:52:06.930 --> 01:52:07.150]
Yeah.

[01:52:07.990 --> 01:52:10.870]
And he was given a host speak about the Pope being in town

[01:52:10.870 --> 01:52:12.510]
and to give people, and he said in God,

[01:52:12.690 --> 01:52:14.490]
even to give Neil Rogers, that's the truth.

[01:52:15.150 --> 01:52:16.130]
You asked for an about it.

[01:52:16.910 --> 01:52:17.790]
I never heard it.

[01:52:17.870 --> 01:52:20.110]
I know that the Lord even loves Neil Rogers.

[01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:21.310]
Really?

[01:52:21.930 --> 01:52:22.370]
Why?

[01:52:23.110 --> 01:52:23.950]
Everybody heard it.

[01:52:23.950 --> 01:52:25.350]
People were calling from all over.

[01:52:25.650 --> 01:52:27.030]
My friends called me and then

[01:52:27.030 --> 01:52:29.170]
heard people calling the state because they spoke to Glenn.

[01:52:29.670 --> 01:52:31.090]
He was asking about it and talk about it.

[01:52:31.210 --> 01:52:32.370]
It was the funniest thing I heard.

[01:52:32.630 --> 01:52:33.590]
Well, and you lost.

[01:52:33.910 --> 01:52:34.230]
OK.

[01:52:34.590 --> 01:52:34.950]
Thank you.

[01:52:35.330 --> 01:52:35.870]
Thank you.

[01:52:36.150 --> 01:52:37.470]
Sort of like I don't know where she was.

[01:52:37.770 --> 01:52:40.510]
It was like a semi-tunnel kind of.

[01:52:40.710 --> 01:52:41.110]
It was good.

[01:52:41.290 --> 01:52:41.510]
Yeah.

[01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:43.130]
It was building to a crescendo.

[01:52:43.330 --> 01:52:43.970]
I liked it a lot.

[01:52:44.770 --> 01:52:45.310]
Broward County.

[01:52:45.530 --> 01:52:45.690]
Hello.

[01:52:46.490 --> 01:52:46.710]
Hello.

[01:52:47.090 --> 01:52:47.290]
Yeah.

[01:52:47.770 --> 01:52:48.450]
Yes, sir.

[01:52:48.450 --> 01:52:50.790]
Yeah, this is Tim's partner.

[01:52:50.950 --> 01:52:56.590]
I was calling about, you said John, 316, you were wondering about.

[01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:57.250]
Oh, yeah.

[01:52:57.470 --> 01:53:00.930]
Yeah, that's the same guy on every sports show.

[01:53:01.610 --> 01:53:03.470]
On every, um, well, he sure gets, yeah.

[01:53:03.650 --> 01:53:04.470]
He sure gets around.

[01:53:04.570 --> 01:53:05.070]
I'll tell you that.

[01:53:05.370 --> 01:53:06.370]
Yeah, that's the same guy.

[01:53:06.530 --> 01:53:07.830]
He pays for his own way everywhere.

[01:53:08.070 --> 01:53:09.590]
He was even an East Lansing the other day.

[01:53:09.630 --> 01:53:10.750]
He was at the Michigan State, U.S.

[01:53:10.910 --> 01:53:11.810]
Seagame, wasn't he?

[01:53:11.810 --> 01:53:14.030]
Yeah, he goes all of the country wherever it's on TV.

[01:53:14.030 --> 01:53:15.210]
And he wears that weird wig.

[01:53:15.550 --> 01:53:16.030]
Oh, he does?

[01:53:16.290 --> 01:53:16.910]
With all the color.

[01:53:16.910 --> 01:53:17.830]
I probably got rid of that wig.

[01:53:18.010 --> 01:53:19.430]
Oh, I thought that was Howard Cossell.

[01:53:19.850 --> 01:53:20.170]
Oh, no.

[01:53:21.210 --> 01:53:22.210]
Hey, you got rid of the wig.

[01:53:22.390 --> 01:53:25.050]
I think he was, uh, Jesus, straight from back to the woodstock.

[01:53:25.230 --> 01:53:26.230]
Or Jim McKay, maybe.

[01:53:26.510 --> 01:53:26.690]
Yeah.

[01:53:27.930 --> 01:53:29.290]
Besides, I wanted to clear that up.

[01:53:29.370 --> 01:53:30.610]
I didn't know if he knew it was the same guy.

[01:53:30.790 --> 01:53:32.390]
Bob, you sure have straightened me up.

[01:53:32.610 --> 01:53:33.050]
Oh, OK.

[01:53:33.430 --> 01:53:34.570]
Well, anyway, good to have you back.

[01:53:34.790 --> 01:53:35.190]
Thank you.

[01:53:35.310 --> 01:53:35.830]
All right, Bob.

[01:53:36.310 --> 01:53:38.770]
I know that the Lord even loves Neil Rogers.

[01:53:39.410 --> 01:53:39.870]
Look at this.

[01:53:39.950 --> 01:53:46.590]
Terry is at the brick oven and wants to know if, well, you see, the only problem with

[01:53:46.590 --> 01:53:49.370]
that is if she gets back like in the next hour, that would be great.

[01:53:49.370 --> 01:53:52.290]
But if she gets back at about four this afternoon, we'll all be gone.

[01:53:52.290 --> 01:53:52.530]
Yeah.

[01:53:52.690 --> 01:53:54.670]
She brought back a couple of those nice little pies.

[01:53:54.670 --> 01:53:55.370]
That would be nice.

[01:53:55.390 --> 01:53:56.150]
It would be wonderful.

[01:53:56.490 --> 01:53:57.030]
Wouldn't that be great?

[01:53:57.130 --> 01:53:57.310]
Yeah.

[01:53:57.750 --> 01:53:58.730]
And maybe a few bagels.

[01:54:00.370 --> 01:54:03.530]
Well, we got a few of those stale bagels from the freezer while we're waiting.

[01:54:04.230 --> 01:54:05.270]
You go open that.

[01:54:05.350 --> 01:54:06.070]
No, thanks.

[01:54:06.290 --> 01:54:07.170]
Smells like bagels.

[01:54:07.210 --> 01:54:07.870]
El Paso.

[01:54:07.990 --> 01:54:08.330]
All right.

[01:54:08.750 --> 01:54:11.490]
You're going to have to give the numbers out.

[01:54:11.770 --> 01:54:14.790]
Now, that's several lines that are not ringing during this new now.

[01:54:14.910 --> 01:54:15.470]
That's all the things.

[01:54:15.470 --> 01:54:19.150]
You know, I go away for 10 days and you come back and they have a bit all that enthusiastic.

[01:54:19.290 --> 01:54:23.490]
They it's like they're waiting for something like they're waiting for the show to start.

[01:54:24.730 --> 01:54:25.430]
This is it.

[01:54:25.710 --> 01:54:26.290]
This is it.

[01:54:26.410 --> 01:54:27.650]
What you hear is what you get.

[01:54:27.650 --> 01:54:28.190]
There they go.

[01:54:28.610 --> 01:54:31.710]
Well, they're just like they're like puppets on a string, aren't they?

[01:54:32.150 --> 01:54:34.910]
And I have held their hand like Mary Annette for 10 days.

[01:54:34.910 --> 01:54:35.930]
I've held their hand.

[01:54:36.110 --> 01:54:36.790]
I've assured them.

[01:54:36.790 --> 01:54:39.370]
Well, they better wash with with no.

[01:54:39.650 --> 01:54:41.230]
What was that soap like pumice?

[01:54:41.470 --> 01:54:42.750]
What was that disgusting soap?

[01:54:42.870 --> 01:54:43.390]
Was it lava?

[01:54:43.810 --> 01:54:44.170]
Lava.

[01:54:44.170 --> 01:54:44.750]
Ooh.

[01:54:45.210 --> 01:54:46.010]
L-A-V-A.

[01:54:46.110 --> 01:54:48.210]
It's like washing your hands with a rock exactly.

[01:54:48.370 --> 01:54:50.090]
I understand that Rick Weaver bathes with lava.

[01:54:52.190 --> 01:54:53.970]
And you never get any suds off of it.

[01:54:54.030 --> 01:54:55.070]
That's the problem, you know.

[01:54:55.350 --> 01:55:00.790]
It's people that are extra dirty like your hands like a mechanic who works on a car.

[01:55:00.910 --> 01:55:01.150]
Oh, yeah.

[01:55:01.350 --> 01:55:02.010]
It's perfect for Rick Weaver.

[01:55:02.150 --> 01:55:02.310]
Yeah.

[01:55:03.370 --> 01:55:05.110]
It'll get all that grease and oil.

[01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:06.390]
It'll land or it'll all happen.

[01:55:06.750 --> 01:55:06.850]
Yeah.

[01:55:07.130 --> 01:55:07.810]
That's who it's for.

[01:55:07.890 --> 01:55:11.570]
Like if you have like ashes like I do there on my hand right from the cigar.

[01:55:12.090 --> 01:55:14.090]
They still make that I think, don't they?

[01:55:14.530 --> 01:55:14.910]
Lava.

[01:55:15.570 --> 01:55:16.670]
He needs goop.

[01:55:17.450 --> 01:55:17.890]
Goop.

[01:55:17.970 --> 01:55:19.130]
Yeah, I remember goop.

[01:55:19.290 --> 01:55:19.570]
Yeah.

[01:55:19.810 --> 01:55:20.390]
I don't remember that.

[01:55:20.570 --> 01:55:22.730]
Yeah, they use it in garages.

[01:55:23.270 --> 01:55:23.570]
Goop.

[01:55:24.050 --> 01:55:24.830]
Yeah, right?

[01:55:25.110 --> 01:55:26.470]
And where they...

[01:55:28.670 --> 01:55:29.350]
That's true.

[01:55:29.490 --> 01:55:30.490]
I have a great name for soap.

[01:55:30.570 --> 01:55:31.150]
How about mung?

[01:55:31.530 --> 01:55:33.150]
That's a perfect name.

[01:55:33.890 --> 01:55:38.110]
When you're really dirty from head to toe, mung will get it all.

[01:55:38.150 --> 01:55:40.550]
And you get Rick Weaver do the testimony all you know.

[01:55:40.550 --> 01:55:42.290]
It'll be great to be mung.

[01:55:42.530 --> 01:55:42.730]
Yeah.

[01:55:43.050 --> 01:55:43.990]
He kind of looks like it.

[01:55:44.030 --> 01:55:44.350]
Uh-huh.

[01:55:44.730 --> 01:55:45.190]
Dade County.

[01:55:45.290 --> 01:55:45.490]
Hello.

[01:55:46.410 --> 01:55:47.130]
Dade County.

[01:55:47.390 --> 01:55:47.890]
Yes, sir.

[01:55:47.990 --> 01:55:49.890]
Are you in Dade County or is this just an ugly rumor?

[01:55:50.710 --> 01:55:51.050]
Yes, sir.

[01:55:51.230 --> 01:55:51.850]
Are you in Dade County?

[01:55:52.110 --> 01:55:53.190]
Oh, I like the other one.

[01:55:53.230 --> 01:55:53.950]
The radio is just right.

[01:55:54.150 --> 01:55:54.490]
That's good.

[01:55:54.590 --> 01:55:55.410]
Turn it way up here.

[01:55:55.970 --> 01:55:55.990]
Yeah.

[01:55:56.830 --> 01:55:58.170]
Turn that radio way up.

[01:56:00.070 --> 01:56:00.430]
Hello.

[01:56:00.630 --> 01:56:01.950]
Let me turn the radio up, okay?

[01:56:02.050 --> 01:56:02.650]
Yeah, turn it on.

[01:56:03.150 --> 01:56:03.510]
Okay.

[01:56:03.790 --> 01:56:05.790]
We want a little trip into the sound tunnel here.

[01:56:05.850 --> 01:56:06.210]
Come on.

[01:56:06.890 --> 01:56:07.910]
I've had that today.

[01:56:07.930 --> 01:56:09.350]
Oh, the wind's time tunnel would be good.

[01:56:09.350 --> 01:56:09.690]
I don't know.

[01:56:10.150 --> 01:56:12.590]
Good James Daron in there and Pat Boone maybe.

[01:56:15.010 --> 01:56:18.570]
And uh, serious heavy duty waterless hand cleaner.

[01:56:19.430 --> 01:56:20.570]
I don't know that one.

[01:56:21.030 --> 01:56:21.710]
Go ahead, sir.

[01:56:22.610 --> 01:56:23.230]
Speak to us.

[01:56:23.530 --> 01:56:24.850]
Somebody call Ben at the call.

[01:56:24.850 --> 01:56:26.050]
What a call this is.

[01:56:26.170 --> 01:56:29.090]
A meeting at the uh, the sky.

[01:56:29.790 --> 01:56:30.230]
Yeah.

[01:56:30.510 --> 01:56:32.650]
They never left a number with that you can call.

[01:56:32.870 --> 01:56:34.530]
Okay, well they'll call back and give it to us.

[01:56:34.610 --> 01:56:35.050]
Good luck to you.

[01:56:36.050 --> 01:56:36.930]
Bug off.

[01:56:38.930 --> 01:56:41.230]
Oh, that's good.

[01:56:44.110 --> 01:56:45.110]
That's great.

[01:56:45.850 --> 01:56:49.010]
A trip into the WINZ time tunnel.

[01:56:49.470 --> 01:56:52.170]
A trip into the WINZ time tunnel.

[01:56:52.290 --> 01:57:06.910]
Ladies and gentlemen, finally, if we go back far enough, we'll hear Joey Pinto and WKBW

[01:57:06.910 --> 01:57:06.910]

[01:57:06.910 --> 01:57:06.910]

[01:57:06.910 --> 01:57:07.610]
and Buffalo.

[01:57:07.970 --> 01:57:09.550]
We can't go back that far.

[01:57:10.490 --> 01:57:12.530]
1859 and you were there.

[01:57:13.670 --> 01:57:14.350]
1859.

[01:57:14.730 --> 01:57:19.350]
Dan Roberts, Dan Nevrith and Joey Reynolds together in stereo.

[01:57:19.730 --> 01:57:22.470]
The band Joey Reynolds together in stereo.

[01:57:23.970 --> 01:57:25.470]
They have stereo back there.

[01:57:26.610 --> 01:57:28.570]
Yeah, I'm here to chill under.

[01:57:30.150 --> 01:57:31.750]
I'm here to chill under.

[01:57:49.350 --> 01:57:53.750]
How much of uh, I know that the board even loves me a lot.

[01:57:57.850 --> 01:58:00.150]
Okay, we're doing great till they start with that stuff.

[01:58:00.350 --> 01:58:05.070]
How much of the nine rating do you think we should attribute to the time tunnel?

[01:58:06.290 --> 01:58:06.450]
Eight.

[01:58:07.770 --> 01:58:08.830]
Dave County, hello.

[01:58:09.110 --> 01:58:09.450]
Hey, Neil.

[01:58:09.770 --> 01:58:10.090]
How you doing?

[01:58:10.430 --> 01:58:10.930]
This is a circuit boy.

[01:58:11.090 --> 01:58:12.510]
That number is 856.

[01:58:13.070 --> 01:58:15.270]
Boy, this guy, how did you get on so fast?

[01:58:15.770 --> 01:58:15.910]
Huh?

[01:58:16.210 --> 01:58:17.110]
How the hell did you get on?

[01:58:17.190 --> 01:58:18.190]
All the lines were flashing.

[01:58:18.410 --> 01:58:20.410]
I'm in my mobile car in my garage.

[01:58:20.730 --> 01:58:21.090]
Oh, I see.

[01:58:21.090 --> 01:58:23.570]
We haven't had many any mobile callers today at all.

[01:58:25.150 --> 01:58:25.790]
856, 8378.

[01:58:26.170 --> 01:58:27.470]
So is that what you like?

[01:58:27.730 --> 01:58:28.130]
A straightaway.

[01:58:28.350 --> 01:58:29.030]
Do you want to say it again?

[01:58:29.390 --> 01:58:29.710]
856.

[01:58:31.030 --> 01:58:31.350]
8378.

[01:58:31.390 --> 01:58:31.710]
What is that?

[01:58:31.790 --> 01:58:32.750]
Bob Quinn's home number?

[01:58:33.130 --> 01:58:33.770]
No, no, no, no.

[01:58:33.910 --> 01:58:34.130]
Come on.

[01:58:34.270 --> 01:58:37.230]
You know, he's got a bad rap but the guys trying to do some good.

[01:58:37.470 --> 01:58:37.830]
Oh, yeah.

[01:58:38.270 --> 01:58:38.590]
Seriously.

[01:58:38.950 --> 01:58:40.730]
Ask him when he's going to go out and get an honest job.

[01:58:41.230 --> 01:58:47.690]
Uh, well, you know, if you really want to information about it, Neil, we're going to publish that in that other publication that you really hate to keep that he win.

[01:58:48.030 --> 01:58:49.250]
That's my favorite newspaper.

[01:58:49.250 --> 01:58:51.830]
He's going to get a full financial disclosure.

[01:58:52.030 --> 01:58:53.010]
I've got news for you.

[01:58:53.130 --> 01:58:57.590]
Since they sent me my glossies of Jason Gadrick.

[01:58:57.610 --> 01:58:59.110]
Jason Gadrick and Tom Howell.

[01:58:59.250 --> 01:59:00.830]
That's my favorite newspaper in America.

[01:59:02.490 --> 01:59:02.890]
Hello?

[01:59:03.170 --> 01:59:03.510]
Okay.

[01:59:03.750 --> 01:59:06.150]
He almost, when he heard those two names he dropped over.

[01:59:06.610 --> 01:59:08.270]
He went into a cold sweat.

[01:59:08.350 --> 01:59:11.010]
Is Circus Boy the way you would like to be referred to?

[01:59:11.270 --> 01:59:13.690]
Yeah, I think I'm going to get rid of the title, like Gay Blade.

[01:59:14.070 --> 01:59:16.010]
Nobody seems to understand what that name is.

[01:59:16.090 --> 01:59:16.290]
Yeah.

[01:59:16.290 --> 01:59:19.250]
It's a 1926 car my grandfather told me about.

[01:59:19.610 --> 01:59:19.850]
Sure.

[01:59:20.090 --> 01:59:25.430]
Actually, it was a street guy that was very fashionable and very hip and very, you know, cool.

[01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:26.850]
In the roaring 20s, right?

[01:59:26.990 --> 01:59:27.010]
Exactly.

[01:59:27.250 --> 01:59:28.170]
More the gay 90s.

[01:59:28.350 --> 01:59:28.450]
Yeah.

[01:59:28.730 --> 01:59:29.670]
Oh, either one step.

[01:59:30.110 --> 01:59:30.430]
Yeah.

[01:59:31.370 --> 01:59:34.090]
But anyway, that's 856-8378.

[01:59:34.290 --> 01:59:36.210]
Anything, any information you need, please.

[01:59:36.250 --> 01:59:38.410]
What is, is that Jeff Striker's number one?

[01:59:38.630 --> 01:59:40.770]
Uh, Jeff Striker is on the phones now.

[01:59:42.170 --> 01:59:42.850]
Oh, boy.

[01:59:43.370 --> 01:59:43.630]
What?

[01:59:44.990 --> 01:59:45.890]
Maybe surprise.

[01:59:46.130 --> 01:59:46.770]
Well, this is okay.

[01:59:47.130 --> 01:59:48.330]
Well, you better go grab it, sir.

[01:59:49.030 --> 01:59:49.610]
Why you can't?

[01:59:50.570 --> 01:59:51.310]
Broward, hello.

[01:59:52.150 --> 01:59:53.550]
Yes, I'm talking to your rages.

[01:59:53.910 --> 01:59:54.190]
Okay.

[01:59:54.630 --> 01:59:55.690]
Who's calling, please?

[01:59:55.970 --> 01:59:56.710]
I'm calling from Cluiston.

[01:59:57.230 --> 01:59:57.530]
From where?

[01:59:57.730 --> 01:59:58.090]
Cluiston?

[01:59:58.350 --> 01:59:58.530]
Listen.

[01:59:58.930 --> 01:59:59.770]
Okay, this is Neil.

[02:00:00.450 --> 02:00:06.870]
I'm trying to confirm a rumor about this special people blessing.

[02:00:07.290 --> 02:00:07.510]
Yeah.

[02:00:07.770 --> 02:00:08.810]
They're all South Floridian.

[02:00:09.030 --> 02:00:09.330]
You bet.

[02:00:09.810 --> 02:00:11.290]
Call the Holy Euronation.

[02:00:11.590 --> 02:00:11.890]
Uh-huh.

[02:00:11.890 --> 02:00:14.090]
And, uh, can you confirm that or not?

[02:00:14.550 --> 02:00:14.810]
Yes.

[02:00:15.650 --> 02:00:16.370]
No matter.

[02:00:16.450 --> 02:00:16.710]
No matter.

[02:00:16.850 --> 02:00:17.850]
In fact, do you remember Billy Carter?

[02:00:18.450 --> 02:00:18.670]
Yes.

[02:00:19.850 --> 02:00:24.090]
Well, Thursday at high noon, the Pope is going to be doing his Billy Carter imitation right

[02:00:24.090 --> 02:00:24.730]
at this guy.

[02:00:25.270 --> 02:00:31.190]
I heard that this special blessing is going to be like a private showing.

[02:00:32.550 --> 02:00:36.950]
And, uh, if you, uh, you know, you can handle it and all that.

[02:00:37.090 --> 02:00:38.210]
You know, you can confirm it.

[02:00:38.270 --> 02:00:39.230]
No, you can't handle it.

[02:00:40.350 --> 02:00:41.070]
Well, I don't know.

[02:00:41.090 --> 02:00:44.930]
Only those, only those altar boys who are especially blessed can handle it.

[02:00:46.270 --> 02:00:47.710]
Hey, you know, I want to say one thing too.

[02:00:47.830 --> 02:00:49.170]
I'm about Cluiston.

[02:00:49.290 --> 02:00:50.530]
I went out and had supper last night.

[02:00:51.030 --> 02:00:52.470]
And all these rest was up here.

[02:00:52.570 --> 02:00:53.830]
Had some of the greatest meals.

[02:00:54.050 --> 02:00:55.990]
I had a nice thick steak and a baked potato.

[02:00:56.350 --> 02:00:57.730]
Would you have a little popsicle for dessert?

[02:00:58.150 --> 02:00:58.410]
No, no.

[02:00:58.510 --> 02:01:00.270]
They cover it with grits, about an each grits.

[02:01:00.370 --> 02:01:00.650]
Oh, yeah.

[02:01:00.710 --> 02:01:00.990]
That's good.

[02:01:01.130 --> 02:01:01.630]
I love clasps.

[02:01:02.210 --> 02:01:04.370]
What a hot cuisine they have up there.

[02:01:04.570 --> 02:01:04.770]
Really?

[02:01:04.910 --> 02:01:05.670]
Just, it's great.

[02:01:06.310 --> 02:01:09.150]
Yeah, you know, we can't get grits like that here in Miami.

[02:01:09.290 --> 02:01:10.230]
Well, I find out one thing.

[02:01:10.410 --> 02:01:12.570]
If they taste like it, I think it's not too grits.

[02:01:13.330 --> 02:01:15.030]
Well, it sounds like it.

[02:01:15.030 --> 02:01:16.630]
Well, anyway, enjoy the show and, uh,

[02:01:17.370 --> 02:01:18.350]
Are you really in Cluiston?

[02:01:18.710 --> 02:01:18.810]
Yeah.

[02:01:19.210 --> 02:01:20.790]
Well, between Cluiston and LaBelle.

[02:01:21.190 --> 02:01:21.890]
And what are you doing there?

[02:01:21.950 --> 02:01:22.770]
You're just on the road?

[02:01:23.270 --> 02:01:24.370]
No, no, no, listen to the radio.

[02:01:24.550 --> 02:01:25.530]
I listen to your show all the time.

[02:01:25.890 --> 02:01:26.550]
And you live there?

[02:01:26.930 --> 02:01:27.310]
Oh, yeah.

[02:01:27.630 --> 02:01:27.770]
Yeah.

[02:01:28.030 --> 02:01:29.650]
Between Cluiston and LaBelle?

[02:01:30.150 --> 02:01:30.250]
Yeah.

[02:01:30.870 --> 02:01:32.750]
Oh, I tell you, it's a good thing we come in up there.

[02:01:32.790 --> 02:01:33.630]
You'd be in a lot of trouble.

[02:01:33.630 --> 02:01:33.870]
Yeah.

[02:01:34.490 --> 02:01:35.390]
You make my day.

[02:01:35.490 --> 02:01:36.610]
It's making better interest.

[02:01:36.890 --> 02:01:37.210]
Yeah, better.

[02:01:37.250 --> 02:01:38.870]
I bet it's required over there.

[02:01:39.350 --> 02:01:40.130]
Yeah, very quiet.

[02:01:40.250 --> 02:01:40.670]
Yeah, very nice.

[02:01:40.950 --> 02:01:43.650]
Okay, we'll send the Monsignor Buoyin up to see you this weekend.

[02:01:43.950 --> 02:01:44.190]
Okay.

[02:01:44.510 --> 02:01:47.470]
We want to confirm it out here because everybody is excited about that.

[02:01:47.610 --> 02:01:50.290]
Okay, well, get your Pope containers ready because, um,

[02:01:50.350 --> 02:01:51.990]
You may be able to catch a specimen or two.

[02:01:52.130 --> 02:01:52.630]
Thanks a lot.

[02:01:53.310 --> 02:01:56.730]
21 before 1 at W.I.N.Z., why is everybody picking on the poor Pope?

[02:01:56.990 --> 02:01:57.130]
Okay.

[02:01:57.350 --> 02:02:00.410]
It's the businessman trying to make a living, you know, business is bad.

[02:02:00.770 --> 02:02:04.150]
And he's just trying to sell a few trinkets and chachkis out there to make a few.

[02:02:04.170 --> 02:02:06.330]
The church, that's all business is very bad.

[02:02:06.450 --> 02:02:07.350]
They seem to be upset.

[02:02:07.990 --> 02:02:08.310]
Yeah.

[02:02:08.590 --> 02:02:10.030]
What the hell are they all upset about?

[02:02:10.550 --> 02:02:12.630]
It's just like there is no difference in all this.

[02:02:12.730 --> 02:02:16.710]
I mean, the polls are in, even from the religious pollsters like Gallup,

[02:02:17.430 --> 02:02:20.630]
93% of the American Catholics think the Pope is full of it.

[02:02:20.670 --> 02:02:20.930]
Okay.

[02:02:20.930 --> 02:02:24.010]
I mean, forget it as far as all of the crap that he talks about,

[02:02:24.270 --> 02:02:25.770]
but they still want to go see him.

[02:02:25.790 --> 02:02:26.470]
It's like Elvis.

[02:02:26.990 --> 02:02:27.370]
Is it?

[02:02:27.450 --> 02:02:28.770]
It's just like Elvis all over again.

[02:02:28.770 --> 02:02:30.250]
It's an older Elvis, yeah.

[02:02:31.250 --> 02:02:32.450]
I never even thought about that.

[02:02:32.690 --> 02:02:39.570]
I would not advise kissing that ring, but...

[02:02:39.570 --> 02:02:39.770]
No.

[02:02:40.930 --> 02:02:41.890]
Any circumstance.

[02:02:42.070 --> 02:02:42.810]
Or anything else.

[02:02:43.170 --> 02:02:43.490]
Exactly.

[02:02:44.950 --> 02:02:50.830]
I'm sure we haven't heard from people in Miami, but I'm sure no one's upset about them, you know, shutting down the city.

[02:02:50.990 --> 02:02:56.410]
How come we're not getting any comment about Michael Jackson and his appearance, which seems to be getting more bizarre?

[02:02:56.410 --> 02:02:57.510]
We talked about...

[02:02:57.510 --> 02:03:00.230]
I didn't think you could get any more bizarre than it was a couple of years ago.

[02:03:00.350 --> 02:03:06.830]
I mean, when he did Thriller, you know, and he and Vincent Price were looking at each other with Gaga eyes in that video.

[02:03:07.310 --> 02:03:13.490]
But I thought he was about as far gone as you could get, but he was very normal by comparison after what he is now.

[02:03:13.630 --> 02:03:15.890]
I opened up the phones to talk about Michael on Tuesday.

[02:03:16.010 --> 02:03:18.530]
His special was on last Monday night on CBS.

[02:03:19.450 --> 02:03:24.050]
And if you'll excuse the expression, it petered out before noon.

[02:03:24.050 --> 02:03:26.090]
And I opened up the phones at 10 o'clock.

[02:03:26.210 --> 02:03:27.970]
No one cares, no one was interested.

[02:03:28.710 --> 02:03:30.950]
But would you want to run into him in a dark alley, though?

[02:03:31.130 --> 02:03:31.890]
That's my question.

[02:03:32.090 --> 02:03:32.250]
No.

[02:03:32.590 --> 02:03:32.890]
You sure?

[02:03:33.650 --> 02:03:34.110]
Yeah.

[02:03:39.270 --> 02:03:39.750]
Hello.

[02:03:40.430 --> 02:03:41.410]
I'm Michael Jackson.

[02:03:41.950 --> 02:03:45.670]
And I sold that Beatles song to Nike for lots of money.

[02:03:45.870 --> 02:03:49.050]
But I still own dozens of great tunes by the Fab4.

[02:03:49.590 --> 02:03:51.510]
And now I'm selling their mouth.

[02:03:51.510 --> 02:03:56.190]
It has big tunnels when you're on the road.

[02:03:56.210 --> 02:03:59.910]
Get yourself a quarter pounder prize and code.

[02:04:00.570 --> 02:04:06.050]
The music that moved your generation in the 60s is ready to move your products in the 80s.

[02:04:06.130 --> 02:04:09.270]
But he loves his own self this week and so am I can.

[02:04:10.410 --> 02:04:14.930]
You can buy a pair of the 1995 dog food.

[02:04:16.250 --> 02:04:17.950]
They're really bad.

[02:04:19.150 --> 02:04:24.350]
But no alcohol tastes much better.

[02:04:26.850 --> 02:04:29.950]
Remember to send it right from the gun.

[02:04:31.710 --> 02:04:32.830]
To your eye.

[02:04:33.930 --> 02:04:34.250]
What's that?

[02:04:34.930 --> 02:04:36.970]
Why is he talking over all in a car?

[02:04:37.210 --> 02:04:41.870]
If you're a company lacks originality and has no respect for classic music,

[02:04:42.390 --> 02:04:43.970]
give me a call and sing.

[02:04:43.970 --> 02:04:46.450]
I'll be in some time.

[02:04:48.810 --> 02:04:52.950]
I know what is this part of a new routine now you just talk to the middle step on Michael Jackson.

[02:04:52.950 --> 02:04:53.570]
I'm sorry.

[02:04:53.590 --> 02:04:56.050]
Do you think you are Dick Perton that you can step on Michael Jackson?

[02:04:56.650 --> 02:04:58.010]
I didn't know the mic was open.

[02:04:58.970 --> 02:04:59.290]
Yeah.

[02:04:59.650 --> 02:05:00.150]
I apologize.

[02:05:00.330 --> 02:05:01.530]
Like I didn't know the gun was loaded.

[02:05:01.610 --> 02:05:01.930]
Exactly.

[02:05:02.190 --> 02:05:03.410]
And I apologize for that.

[02:05:04.050 --> 02:05:04.870]
It won't happen again.

[02:05:05.190 --> 02:05:05.350]
Good.

[02:05:05.990 --> 02:05:07.750]
Now what was the question about Buddy Holly?

[02:05:07.930 --> 02:05:08.330]
Buddy Holly.

[02:05:08.390 --> 02:05:09.090]
No, I don't want that.

[02:05:09.230 --> 02:05:10.750]
Buddy Holly was, he was okay.

[02:05:10.750 --> 02:05:13.790]
It was only around for like a year or two.

[02:05:13.790 --> 02:05:14.190]
I know.

[02:05:14.630 --> 02:05:14.890]
I know.

[02:05:15.550 --> 02:05:16.130]
What do you have?

[02:05:16.230 --> 02:05:18.130]
That'll be the day Peggy Sue and Old Boy.

[02:05:18.290 --> 02:05:19.710]
Those are the only three records I remember.

[02:05:20.290 --> 02:05:21.030]
That'll be the day.

[02:05:21.130 --> 02:05:21.350]
Yeah.

[02:05:21.650 --> 02:05:22.130]
That's about it.

[02:05:22.590 --> 02:05:22.910]
That's it.

[02:05:24.130 --> 02:05:25.250]
Like Ritty Valens.

[02:05:25.910 --> 02:05:26.550]
Here in La Bomba.

[02:05:26.710 --> 02:05:26.850]
Yeah.

[02:05:27.430 --> 02:05:29.150]
Then La Bomba and more La Bomba.

[02:05:30.610 --> 02:05:32.370]
And La Bomba, La Bomba, La Bomba.

[02:05:32.430 --> 02:05:32.750]
That's it.

[02:05:34.610 --> 02:05:35.650]
Maybe one more.

[02:05:35.790 --> 02:05:36.930]
And if you didn't like it the first time.

[02:05:37.230 --> 02:05:38.030]
And the big bopper.

[02:05:38.030 --> 02:05:39.090]
Shantilly Lace.

[02:05:39.530 --> 02:05:40.670]
And what else?

[02:05:40.910 --> 02:05:41.190]
That's it.

[02:05:41.670 --> 02:05:42.350]
That's all I remember.

[02:05:42.510 --> 02:05:47.290]
Well I remember as a little kid in diapers growing up listening to Joey Reynolds on WKBW and

[02:05:47.290 --> 02:05:47.850]
Bop-Bop-Bop-Bop.

[02:05:47.990 --> 02:05:48.130]
Yeah.

[02:05:51.110 --> 02:05:52.670]
Shantilly Lace by the big bopper.

[02:05:52.810 --> 02:05:53.850]
I was just a little kid.

[02:05:53.970 --> 02:05:54.670]
A little kid.

[02:05:54.950 --> 02:05:57.030]
Howard Stern was just a little kid in those days too.

[02:05:57.810 --> 02:06:01.710]
And of course Joey was on the radio with the beard, the whole business.

[02:06:02.010 --> 02:06:02.350]
Mm-hmm.

[02:06:03.110 --> 02:06:04.310]
Dave County, you say what?

[02:06:04.550 --> 02:06:04.930]
Oh no.

[02:06:05.170 --> 02:06:05.710]
It's Joey Reynolds.

[02:06:06.250 --> 02:06:07.210]
Yeah, it sounds like it.

[02:06:07.210 --> 02:06:08.110]
Don't start, sir.

[02:06:08.110 --> 02:06:08.110]

[02:06:08.290 --> 02:06:08.830]
It's Joey Reynolds.

[02:06:08.890 --> 02:06:09.810]
Don't start, sir.

[02:06:11.510 --> 02:06:14.570]
He's not going to speak to us all well.

[02:06:15.610 --> 02:06:16.230]
Otherwise, ask.

[02:06:16.370 --> 02:06:16.570]
Hello.

[02:06:17.610 --> 02:06:18.090]
Broward.

[02:06:19.930 --> 02:06:20.990]
Is there someone there?

[02:06:21.230 --> 02:06:22.570]
You always tell nobody there.

[02:06:22.950 --> 02:06:23.090]
Nobody there.

[02:06:23.090 --> 02:06:23.910]
You always tell nobody there.

[02:06:23.910 --> 02:06:24.210]
And then there's a line five.

[02:06:25.090 --> 02:06:26.270]
There's never anybody on that line.

[02:06:26.510 --> 02:06:30.150]
That's just the sort of a break between calls, right?

[02:06:30.510 --> 02:06:30.510]

[02:06:30.670 --> 02:06:31.550]
It's the segue line.

[02:06:31.690 --> 02:06:31.850]
Yeah.

[02:06:32.130 --> 02:06:32.830]
Hello, Broward.

[02:06:33.750 --> 02:06:34.230]
Hello.

[02:06:34.950 --> 02:06:35.150]
Yes.

[02:06:35.150 --> 02:06:36.590]
Yeah, this is Jeff Stryker.

[02:06:38.370 --> 02:06:40.130]
Was that a good imitation or what?

[02:06:40.210 --> 02:06:41.070]
Yeah, that was very good.

[02:06:41.190 --> 02:06:43.010]
You've evidently seen some of those movies, huh?

[02:06:43.230 --> 02:06:43.870]
I've seen several.

[02:06:44.030 --> 02:06:45.290]
Yes, we've talked about...

[02:06:45.290 --> 02:06:46.690]
Okay, why you sound out of breath, sir.

[02:06:47.870 --> 02:06:49.270]
It's the mobile phone.

[02:06:49.950 --> 02:06:50.990]
Are you on a mobile phone?

[02:06:51.110 --> 02:06:51.690]
I am indeed.

[02:06:51.990 --> 02:06:53.630]
And is Jeff Stryker in the past in your seat?

[02:06:54.110 --> 02:06:54.410]
Yeah.

[02:06:55.590 --> 02:06:56.190]
In your credit.

[02:06:57.610 --> 02:06:59.490]
First you get down on your knees,

[02:06:59.890 --> 02:07:01.430]
that old with your rosaries.

[02:07:01.830 --> 02:07:04.170]
Okay, a little advice from the pope there, from the holy father.

[02:07:04.170 --> 02:07:06.630]
Well, when I'm on my knees, I don't fiddle with rosaries.

[02:07:08.370 --> 02:07:08.910]
I'll bet.

[02:07:09.070 --> 02:07:10.410]
You sound just like the types, sir.

[02:07:10.590 --> 02:07:10.950]
Uh-huh.

[02:07:11.130 --> 02:07:12.110]
Another one of those preverts.

[02:07:12.770 --> 02:07:13.330]
I am.

[02:07:13.950 --> 02:07:14.950]
And I'm proud of it.

[02:07:14.970 --> 02:07:15.630]
Well, good for you.

[02:07:16.150 --> 02:07:16.970]
So how was your vacation?

[02:07:17.390 --> 02:07:17.910]
It was okay.

[02:07:18.050 --> 02:07:19.110]
It was kind of quiet, you know.

[02:07:19.530 --> 02:07:19.790]
Uh-huh.

[02:07:19.890 --> 02:07:21.850]
A one enough money to bring back from New York State

[02:07:21.850 --> 02:07:24.310]
to afford a deposited caulder and, you know,

[02:07:25.030 --> 02:07:28.170]
trying to add to the wealth of the sunshine state.

[02:07:30.470 --> 02:07:33.510]
Michael Jackson, he's gone over.

[02:07:33.990 --> 02:07:34.790]
Over the limit.

[02:07:35.170 --> 02:07:35.310]
Yeah.

[02:07:36.130 --> 02:07:37.510]
He's a, I love his new chin.

[02:07:38.610 --> 02:07:40.070]
Let me see that magazine again.

[02:07:40.110 --> 02:07:40.590]
Where's people?

[02:07:41.230 --> 02:07:42.690]
Uh-uh, you, you have people?

[02:07:42.790 --> 02:07:43.410]
He's on the cover.

[02:07:43.430 --> 02:07:43.470]
He's on the cover.

[02:07:43.610 --> 02:07:44.110]
He was me.

[02:07:44.430 --> 02:07:44.430]

[02:07:44.750 --> 02:07:46.950]
Yeah, the new, um, what do they call it?

[02:07:47.050 --> 02:07:47.570]
A cleft?

[02:07:47.790 --> 02:07:48.330]
A cleft.

[02:07:48.510 --> 02:07:49.650]
Yeah, I have a natural cleft.

[02:07:49.750 --> 02:07:50.550]
He's still for me.

[02:07:51.110 --> 02:07:51.310]
Yeah.

[02:07:51.730 --> 02:07:52.090]
Mm-hmm.

[02:07:53.030 --> 02:07:53.610]
Uh-uh.

[02:07:53.650 --> 02:07:55.710]
Yeah, he has all these little private operations.

[02:07:55.710 --> 02:07:58.970]
He has them making incisions and little things in a strangeest places.

[02:07:59.410 --> 02:08:01.210]
Yeah, there was an article in the Sun Sentinels.

[02:08:01.470 --> 02:08:02.910]
A little blurb today, I think.

[02:08:02.910 --> 02:08:07.890]
And about his publicity agent said that he's never had eye surgery,

[02:08:08.130 --> 02:08:10.950]
but he has had the cleft put in his chin,

[02:08:11.130 --> 02:08:12.450]
and he has had certain operations.

[02:08:12.450 --> 02:08:15.230]
He admits certain operations and denies.

[02:08:15.370 --> 02:08:18.750]
I hear he had a little cleft somewhere else in his body, too,

[02:08:18.750 --> 02:08:21.170]
that we can't discuss on a year, because it's actionable.

[02:08:22.310 --> 02:08:25.150]
But, um, the way I think, you know, I'm sitting here looking at this picture

[02:08:25.150 --> 02:08:29.370]
on the front of people, I'm thinking, what a great role model he is for the youth of America today, isn't he?

[02:08:29.490 --> 02:08:29.910]
Isn't he?

[02:08:29.990 --> 02:08:31.350]
He has been for several years.

[02:08:31.350 --> 02:08:35.490]
He's worth $3 billion, and he looks like Diana Ross and Dran, you know.

[02:08:35.490 --> 02:08:37.870]
Yeah, he looks like his sister more than anything right now.

[02:08:38.130 --> 02:08:38.250]
Yeah.

[02:08:38.770 --> 02:08:40.150]
Yeah, that's the, that's her name?

[02:08:40.490 --> 02:08:44.190]
Janet, that's the most frequent comment I got when we talked about Michael.

[02:08:44.290 --> 02:08:46.810]
And you notice we don't see Janet and Michael together anymore at all.

[02:08:46.850 --> 02:08:47.610]
Have you never seen her?

[02:08:47.610 --> 02:08:47.850]
Never.

[02:08:48.110 --> 02:08:48.110]

[02:08:48.330 --> 02:08:49.870]
And that was the most frequent comment.

[02:08:50.030 --> 02:08:50.910]
They are the same person.

[02:08:51.110 --> 02:08:52.230]
I am wouldn't doubt it.

[02:08:52.570 --> 02:08:52.770]
Yeah.

[02:08:53.030 --> 02:08:53.310]
No one.

[02:08:53.490 --> 02:08:54.350]
No one can deny it.

[02:08:54.370 --> 02:08:56.850]
So I guess you wouldn't want to run into Michael in a dark alley.

[02:08:56.970 --> 02:08:57.950]
Yeah, he's not my type.

[02:08:58.990 --> 02:09:00.170]
I'm running the gym.

[02:09:01.130 --> 02:09:04.290]
Well, I would run into him very slowly and carefully if I were you.

[02:09:04.530 --> 02:09:06.090]
It would have to be very slowly.

[02:09:06.310 --> 02:09:07.170]
I would think so.

[02:09:07.270 --> 02:09:07.370]
Yeah.

[02:09:07.830 --> 02:09:11.210]
Well, listen, have a great day and keep it up.

[02:09:11.410 --> 02:09:13.410]
Okay, well, squeeze Jeff's knee one time for me.

[02:09:13.590 --> 02:09:14.350]
Okay, see you later.

[02:09:15.070 --> 02:09:16.970]
Gee, here's a, what is that?

[02:09:17.030 --> 02:09:19.190]
A button that says, go ahead, bless my day.

[02:09:19.770 --> 02:09:20.130]
Wow.

[02:09:21.290 --> 02:09:21.650]
Right.

[02:09:22.230 --> 02:09:23.390]
Next to Clint Eastwood.

[02:09:23.590 --> 02:09:23.950]
Carmel, California.

[02:09:24.910 --> 02:09:25.870]
Go ahead, bless my day.

[02:09:25.910 --> 02:09:27.870]
It's got a picture of the Pope and his hands up the air.

[02:09:27.870 --> 02:09:30.770]
And he's waving and he's holding that the schmathy in the whole business.

[02:09:31.870 --> 02:09:32.270]
Unbelievable.

[02:09:32.570 --> 02:09:33.950]
Go ahead, bless my day.

[02:09:34.450 --> 02:09:34.850]
Haha.

[02:09:35.450 --> 02:09:35.850]
Haha.

[02:09:37.610 --> 02:09:38.410]
Pope Eastwood.

[02:09:38.730 --> 02:09:39.150]
Mm-hmm.

[02:09:39.790 --> 02:09:40.190]
Incredible.

[02:09:40.630 --> 02:09:43.150]
Well, listen, you know, times are tough and he got to make some money.

[02:09:43.270 --> 02:09:43.970]
Business is bad.

[02:09:47.250 --> 02:09:48.850]
See, they got a big, look at that.

[02:09:49.470 --> 02:09:50.890]
Here's the Pope looking out the window.

[02:09:51.470 --> 02:09:52.750]
And he's got that dress on.

[02:09:52.870 --> 02:09:53.290]
That skirt.

[02:09:54.230 --> 02:09:55.070]
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

[02:09:55.070 --> 02:09:56.890]
His designer has got to be the best, huh?

[02:09:57.330 --> 02:09:57.710]
Haha.

[02:09:58.370 --> 02:09:59.230]
Dave County, hello.

[02:09:59.550 --> 02:09:59.930]
Hello.

[02:10:01.050 --> 02:10:01.430]
Yes.

[02:10:01.850 --> 02:10:02.730]
How are you, Neil?

[02:10:02.870 --> 02:10:03.710]
Okay, how are you?

[02:10:04.110 --> 02:10:05.330]
Why do you sound so depressed?

[02:10:06.430 --> 02:10:09.230]
Oh, boy, you would be depressed after who this is.

[02:10:10.010 --> 02:10:10.630]
Oh, no.

[02:10:11.510 --> 02:10:12.410]
Go ahead, hang up.

[02:10:13.110 --> 02:10:13.670]
It is.

[02:10:13.850 --> 02:10:14.210]
It is.

[02:10:14.370 --> 02:10:15.410]
I was afraid of that.

[02:10:15.570 --> 02:10:17.170]
Straight from Israel to our hearts.

[02:10:17.350 --> 02:10:17.510]
Yeah.

[02:10:18.090 --> 02:10:19.210]
Go ahead, what's happened?

[02:10:19.250 --> 02:10:19.710]
What happened?

[02:10:19.850 --> 02:10:23.070]
It sounds like something, one of them must have dropped while he was on vacation.

[02:10:23.070 --> 02:10:25.010]
He sounds an octave lower today, doesn't he?

[02:10:25.250 --> 02:10:25.510]
Exactly.

[02:10:25.810 --> 02:10:26.430]
I've been neutered.

[02:10:26.770 --> 02:10:28.110]
How come you're not in school?

[02:10:28.670 --> 02:10:29.490]
What do you mean school?

[02:10:29.650 --> 02:10:30.170]
I graduated.

[02:10:30.910 --> 02:10:32.030]
How come you're not in school?

[02:10:32.830 --> 02:10:33.030]
What?

[02:10:33.270 --> 02:10:37.050]
No, I range my classes at the University, according to your show.

[02:10:37.130 --> 02:10:38.270]
How are you going to do, you know, great.

[02:10:38.650 --> 02:10:39.730]
Which means he'll be on W-Width.

[02:10:39.730 --> 02:10:41.430]
Well, we loved your last newsletter.

[02:10:41.430 --> 02:10:42.310]
It was a classic.

[02:10:42.650 --> 02:10:43.850]
Can I ask you two questions?

[02:10:44.090 --> 02:10:45.610]
How come he's on the air here today, though?

[02:10:45.950 --> 02:10:48.370]
Usually, what is this, a new routine now?

[02:10:48.770 --> 02:10:48.970]
Yes.

[02:10:49.890 --> 02:10:50.630]
What have you done?

[02:10:50.710 --> 02:10:52.170]
Have you gone to reform school or something?

[02:10:52.170 --> 02:10:52.870]
I'm not familiar to the rabbi.

[02:10:53.030 --> 02:10:54.010]
I just give you good talking, though.

[02:10:54.030 --> 02:10:56.250]
Oh, now that Lee has a...

[02:10:56.250 --> 02:10:59.070]
In the hospital, he is giving me broadcast and lessons.

[02:10:59.530 --> 02:10:59.710]
Yeah.

[02:10:59.950 --> 02:11:01.710]
Life will never be the same again without Lee.

[02:11:01.850 --> 02:11:06.150]
Don't forget to go to Peach's records and tapes and get Lee's new album.

[02:11:06.310 --> 02:11:07.090]
Lee's greatest bowl.

[02:11:09.370 --> 02:11:12.670]
That's coming out very soon, but I wanted to find out two things from you.

[02:11:13.510 --> 02:11:16.090]
Are you sitting down, by the way, the speaker system is terrible.

[02:11:16.490 --> 02:11:17.730]
Well, that's because we're on a speaker phone.

[02:11:17.850 --> 02:11:20.570]
We're just doing this today to give Kyle a little vacation,

[02:11:20.570 --> 02:11:22.470]
which is the only reason you've got on the air.

[02:11:22.630 --> 02:11:23.270]
That's right.

[02:11:24.090 --> 02:11:25.090]
We better believe that.

[02:11:25.150 --> 02:11:25.750]
Don't knock it.

[02:11:25.830 --> 02:11:27.090]
That's the only reason you've got on.

[02:11:27.890 --> 02:11:29.290]
Okay, I will not knock it.

[02:11:29.690 --> 02:11:31.530]
Well, he can turn down to the sink, can't he?

[02:11:32.150 --> 02:11:33.930]
Yeah, he could cut you off, but he wouldn't do that yet.

[02:11:34.050 --> 02:11:34.570]
And I know.

[02:11:34.710 --> 02:11:34.810]
Yeah.

[02:11:35.070 --> 02:11:35.830]
And I'd rip him.

[02:11:36.250 --> 02:11:37.490]
Let me find out two things from you.

[02:11:37.710 --> 02:11:38.370]
Yeah, I could do it, too.

[02:11:38.410 --> 02:11:39.570]
I could turn you down real low.

[02:11:39.790 --> 02:11:40.270]
Real low.

[02:11:40.550 --> 02:11:40.950]
Like that.

[02:11:41.210 --> 02:11:41.830]
Go ahead.

[02:11:42.470 --> 02:11:44.130]
What is happening with Bill Calder?

[02:11:45.190 --> 02:11:47.510]
Well, Bill is still doing the limbo rock, you know?

[02:11:47.990 --> 02:11:50.390]
Do you see him being on the air somewhere over here?

[02:11:50.610 --> 02:11:51.390]
I sure hope so.

[02:11:51.550 --> 02:11:52.710]
I mean, I don't know what's going on.

[02:11:53.030 --> 02:11:56.610]
I think maybe they could do it when the talkman stops having its fluke.

[02:11:57.070 --> 02:11:57.890]
No, they're not.

[02:11:58.110 --> 02:11:58.670]
They love it.

[02:11:58.770 --> 02:11:59.370]
Don't you understand?

[02:11:59.450 --> 02:12:00.470]
I keep telling him that.

[02:12:00.530 --> 02:12:03.530]
He keeps looking at me and just with that quizzical look,

[02:12:03.530 --> 02:12:04.530]
like how can it be?

[02:12:04.630 --> 02:12:06.730]
And how can Bill McQueen be on the air?

[02:12:06.770 --> 02:12:07.510]
And how can Craig...

[02:12:08.270 --> 02:12:09.030]
Oh, well, now hold on now.

[02:12:09.150 --> 02:12:10.590]
I'll tell these board ops be on here.

[02:12:10.610 --> 02:12:12.350]
You're having a surprise for you coming up.

[02:12:12.770 --> 02:12:13.630]
Okay, wait a minute.

[02:12:14.730 --> 02:12:15.990]
Yeah, I, there it goes.

[02:12:15.990 --> 02:12:17.590]
That's, hello.

[02:12:17.970 --> 02:12:19.590]
That was the surprise.

[02:12:19.850 --> 02:12:20.090]
That was the surprise.

[02:12:20.230 --> 02:12:20.790]
That was great.

[02:12:20.950 --> 02:12:22.510]
I must have been Dr. Heffernan.

[02:12:22.710 --> 02:12:23.010]
No, I'm not.

[02:12:23.170 --> 02:12:23.870]
I think I know that.

[02:12:24.210 --> 02:12:25.870]
Well, no, don't check the other line.

[02:12:25.950 --> 02:12:28.930]
Come on, we put you on the air today and you're going to check the other line.

[02:12:29.210 --> 02:12:30.450]
Lee, don't you understand?

[02:12:30.610 --> 02:12:31.810]
I have a length of an at three o'clock.

[02:12:33.090 --> 02:12:34.610]
Let me find out another thing from you.

[02:12:35.710 --> 02:12:38.190]
Now, supposedly, okay, you know Craig Anderson, right?

[02:12:38.450 --> 02:12:39.070]
Yeah, the board op.

[02:12:39.210 --> 02:12:42.110]
Okay, now Craig Anderson, unfortunately, made a big booboo the other day

[02:12:42.110 --> 02:12:45.290]
by discussing with a Colin listener the AB book.

[02:12:45.650 --> 02:12:46.810]
I mean, in depth.

[02:12:47.510 --> 02:12:50.510]
I discussed the ratings on the year on the Isle of Drains.

[02:12:50.670 --> 02:12:51.890]
This is the AB book.

[02:12:52.030 --> 02:12:52.270]
Wow.

[02:12:53.090 --> 02:12:56.990]
And, uh, I was dealing in depth saying, uh, when are you on?

[02:12:57.250 --> 02:12:59.090]
Should I write you down, et cetera?

[02:12:59.450 --> 02:13:01.090]
Oh, no, boy.

[02:13:01.190 --> 02:13:01.570]
Oh, yeah.

[02:13:02.070 --> 02:13:04.390]
But just by slight chance, I had that on tape.

[02:13:04.970 --> 02:13:05.530]
Mm-hmm.

[02:13:05.890 --> 02:13:09.810]
I was just like, if we could have some kind of party, I spoke to the...

[02:13:09.810 --> 02:13:10.350]
Alright, wait a minute.

[02:13:10.430 --> 02:13:12.650]
Let's do something special for Craig here.

[02:13:18.670 --> 02:13:21.730]
For Mike Anthony in the entire Isle of Dream's format.

[02:13:22.730 --> 02:13:23.670]
For Bill McQuig.

[02:13:25.150 --> 02:13:27.290]
And for Mr. Alibi Ego.

[02:13:28.410 --> 02:13:29.430]
It's 9900.

[02:13:29.550 --> 02:13:30.190]
That's not right.

[02:13:30.270 --> 02:13:30.430]
Yeah.

[02:13:30.950 --> 02:13:31.130]
Mm-hmm.

[02:13:36.530 --> 02:13:37.490]
I'm a bit afraid.

[02:13:37.490 --> 02:13:37.590]
Right.

[02:13:38.310 --> 02:13:39.570]
It's asterisk time.

[02:13:39.910 --> 02:13:43.650]
Oh, ha-ha-ha.

[02:13:48.650 --> 02:13:50.090]
Mike Miller does a little show.

[02:13:50.330 --> 02:13:52.370]
He did a similar thing to look what happened to him.

[02:13:52.690 --> 02:13:52.810]
Yeah.

[02:13:53.510 --> 02:13:59.430]
Now, Mike Miller, before he left on June 18th, I have the letter right in front of me.

[02:14:00.050 --> 02:14:02.010]
I can read it to you if you just take a second.

[02:14:02.170 --> 02:14:02.950]
Listen to this, okay?

[02:14:03.490 --> 02:14:05.150]
This is a letter they sent to Mike Anthony.

[02:14:05.770 --> 02:14:06.370]
You listening?

[02:14:06.370 --> 02:14:09.210]
You know what Mike Anthony said about me last week?

[02:14:09.210 --> 02:14:09.830]
He what?

[02:14:10.490 --> 02:14:12.750]
I know that the Zord even loves Neil Rogers.

[02:14:13.030 --> 02:14:14.310]
Ha-ha-ha.

[02:14:14.530 --> 02:14:15.650]
Yeah, he's a born again.

[02:14:15.790 --> 02:14:16.510]
You betcha.

[02:14:16.770 --> 02:14:18.470]
I hear he doesn't listen to his station either.

[02:14:18.890 --> 02:14:19.730]
Well, I don't blame him.

[02:14:19.910 --> 02:14:21.350]
He just goes by the research.

[02:14:21.490 --> 02:14:23.470]
But let me read you this letter they sent to Mike Anthony.

[02:14:24.090 --> 02:14:27.930]
This is the Amrister Anthony, the Arbitron Special Service Station Activities Committee.

[02:14:27.970 --> 02:14:33.290]
He has completed a review of your response and other information regarding Mike Miller and his June 18 show.

[02:14:33.290 --> 02:14:35.850]
We find no inherent violation of our guidelines.

[02:14:35.870 --> 02:14:41.690]
Please note that there was apparently an air check tape regarding the conversation between Mike Miller and they call and listen to her.

[02:14:41.790 --> 02:14:44.290]
However, one could not be produced by a report production deadline.

[02:14:44.870 --> 02:14:48.290]
The deadline for complaints was June 25th and a resolution by July 12th.

[02:14:48.930 --> 02:14:53.070]
Thank you for your cooperation, Nick Green, Special Special Activities Committee.

[02:14:54.570 --> 02:14:57.610]
Now, unfortunately, I was just too slow in getting the tape in the mail.

[02:14:58.590 --> 02:15:02.510]
But this time, would that mean that if I would put that tape in the mail, are you listening, Doug Young?

[02:15:02.510 --> 02:15:05.390]
By the way, you know he called up Stan Major show the other day.

[02:15:05.670 --> 02:15:08.790]
Doug Young did a crank call on the air.

[02:15:08.910 --> 02:15:09.690]
Yeah, he called.

[02:15:09.890 --> 02:15:13.710]
The WIOD Cox Broadcasting Producer was a crank caller.

[02:15:13.730 --> 02:15:17.510]
You mean that holier than the company that would never do anything unethical?

[02:15:18.570 --> 02:15:20.490]
That would never screw any of their employees?

[02:15:20.970 --> 02:15:21.770]
Oh, come on.

[02:15:22.070 --> 02:15:24.190]
Boy, Mike Anthony must be sore right now.

[02:15:24.490 --> 02:15:24.730]
Wow.

[02:15:25.430 --> 02:15:27.550]
But I know Doug will be sitting down for a week.

[02:15:27.970 --> 02:15:28.250]
Probably.

[02:15:28.550 --> 02:15:31.750]
No, he's out of town visiting his ailing grandmother or something.

[02:15:31.750 --> 02:15:34.110]
I know that the Lord even loves Neil Rogers.

[02:15:35.110 --> 02:15:36.590]
But now here's the story.

[02:15:36.770 --> 02:15:38.510]
When is the summer book over with?

[02:15:39.010 --> 02:15:39.750]
September 20th.

[02:15:40.930 --> 02:15:41.250]
September 25th.

[02:15:41.250 --> 02:15:41.530]
So there's something on that.

[02:15:41.690 --> 02:15:42.170]
25th.

[02:15:42.170 --> 02:15:45.290]
So that means that there's plenty of time for this tape to go into mail.

[02:15:45.330 --> 02:15:45.910]
Of course.

[02:15:46.250 --> 02:15:52.170]
Now if I ask Mike Anthony, now I consider like a present for Bill Caulder, Sandy Payton, Mike Milojeri Sullivan,

[02:15:52.990 --> 02:15:55.950]
Stu Goldstein and all the other various people over there.

[02:15:56.030 --> 02:15:58.550]
Cedarex, Cedarex, Cedarex, Cedarex, and he's screwy's.

[02:15:58.550 --> 02:16:01.010]
What exactly would happen to them?

[02:16:02.890 --> 02:16:05.210]
Well, instead of a one-two, they'd probably get a one-one.

[02:16:05.770 --> 02:16:08.110]
No, but yeah, that'll already happen.

[02:16:08.190 --> 02:16:09.070]
With an asterisk.

[02:16:09.250 --> 02:16:11.350]
But not it'll be an asterisk, one-two.

[02:16:12.370 --> 02:16:14.550]
They could've played it out with a certain FM station.

[02:16:14.570 --> 02:16:17.350]
I don't want to mention the actors, but they could be nipping talk.

[02:16:17.810 --> 02:16:18.890]
Oh, no, no, no, man.

[02:16:19.290 --> 02:16:19.610]
They'd say that.

[02:16:20.090 --> 02:16:22.430]
No, they're very nervous up there.

[02:16:22.770 --> 02:16:25.870]
Oh, listen, it's really a great honor having you back.

[02:16:27.030 --> 02:16:28.590]
I have a post for you.

[02:16:29.290 --> 02:16:30.410]
I'll send it to you.

[02:16:30.570 --> 02:16:30.890]
Okay.

[02:16:31.250 --> 02:16:32.130]
Okay, see you later.

[02:16:32.350 --> 02:16:32.530]
Bye.

[02:16:32.710 --> 02:16:34.790]
Don't forget, look for the asterisk.

[02:16:34.910 --> 02:16:36.510]
Okay, so you need for us to...

[02:16:36.510 --> 02:16:37.570]
We're very calm down.

[02:16:37.770 --> 02:16:39.170]
Yeah, we need for us to tell who that was.

[02:16:39.270 --> 02:16:40.070]
No, okay.

[02:16:40.330 --> 02:16:43.010]
Six minutes before 1 at WINZ, we'll come right back.

[02:16:43.430 --> 02:16:44.010]
Are you kidding me?

[02:16:44.130 --> 02:16:45.690]
We have more cheese cake than here today.

[02:16:45.930 --> 02:16:47.310]
I can't believe it.

[02:16:48.030 --> 02:16:48.470]
Incredible.

[02:16:49.310 --> 02:16:51.370]
I wanted to eat about half of it up front.

[02:16:51.770 --> 02:16:52.830]
Yeah, he was...

[02:16:52.830 --> 02:16:53.330]
Oh, a little bit.

[02:16:53.830 --> 02:16:54.830]
He was all over you.

[02:16:54.910 --> 02:16:55.990]
Well, we don't want to get into that.

[02:16:56.290 --> 02:16:58.490]
I got some KeeLime pie.

[02:16:58.890 --> 02:16:59.850]
KeeLime pie, great.

[02:17:00.530 --> 02:17:01.430]
I don't let me overeat this.

[02:17:01.690 --> 02:17:04.450]
You know, just little bits and pieces, just little tidbits.

[02:17:04.870 --> 02:17:05.470]
Not too much.

[02:17:06.810 --> 02:17:07.130]
Slippers.

[02:17:07.770 --> 02:17:08.730]
Are you eating any of this?

[02:17:09.970 --> 02:17:10.650]
Oh, you might.

[02:17:11.330 --> 02:17:12.910]
He's very picky about what he eats.

[02:17:12.990 --> 02:17:15.630]
He won't eat most of what's brought in here, like the stale bagels the other day.

[02:17:16.030 --> 02:17:16.710]
Wouldn't touch him.

[02:17:17.710 --> 02:17:18.910]
This is not stale now, is it?

[02:17:18.930 --> 02:17:19.590]
This is all fresh.

[02:17:20.950 --> 02:17:21.590]
Freshes can be.

[02:17:22.510 --> 02:17:22.950]
Great.

[02:17:24.650 --> 02:17:26.750]
He's got a special cake for Stanley.

[02:17:27.430 --> 02:17:28.150]
For Stan.

[02:17:28.370 --> 02:17:30.450]
Oh, by the way, Stan Major almost forgot about him.

[02:17:30.450 --> 02:17:31.770]
I have some good hate here for him.

[02:17:32.010 --> 02:17:32.490]
Oh, good.

[02:17:33.090 --> 02:17:36.370]
And Stan's special guest today will be Mark Bosley.

[02:17:36.650 --> 02:17:36.910]
Wow.

[02:17:37.930 --> 02:17:39.170]
The real Mark Bosley?

[02:17:39.310 --> 02:17:40.650]
Is he going to do a Marlon Bailey impression?

[02:17:40.910 --> 02:17:42.930]
Absolutely. I would let him get out of here without it.

[02:17:43.590 --> 02:17:43.750]
Great.

[02:17:43.970 --> 02:17:46.490]
The reason he's going to be here, of course, is because he does Don Johnson.

[02:17:46.610 --> 02:17:48.530]
He's Don Johnson on Halendale Valleys.

[02:17:48.530 --> 02:17:50.690]
And Mark's going to do his special Marlon Bailey impression.

[02:17:50.690 --> 02:17:54.490]
He's going to do 20 minutes of excuses as to why he didn't bring any jackets with him.

[02:17:55.310 --> 02:17:56.210]
I don't know to be great.

[02:17:56.930 --> 02:18:00.410]
He said he's going to bring Stan and Miami Vice Jacket.

[02:18:00.550 --> 02:18:02.450]
And I said, good, that's the only way he'll ever get one.

[02:18:02.770 --> 02:18:02.930]
Yeah.

[02:18:03.570 --> 02:18:05.670]
How do you enjoy your Miami Vice Jacket, by the way?

[02:18:05.670 --> 02:18:06.250]
Oh, it's great.

[02:18:07.090 --> 02:18:08.550]
I fantasize about it a lot.

[02:18:08.750 --> 02:18:10.210]
It's the only way I get to see it.

[02:18:10.930 --> 02:18:13.210]
Anyway, here's a picture of our listener in the Bahamas.

[02:18:13.330 --> 02:18:14.070]
His name is Max.

[02:18:15.210 --> 02:18:16.630]
He's got a great letter from Max.

[02:18:16.630 --> 02:18:17.990]
He's a big fan.

[02:18:18.270 --> 02:18:18.990]
He's a big fan.

[02:18:19.310 --> 02:18:22.810]
He also sent us a 50 cent bill with a picture of a queen on it.

[02:18:22.870 --> 02:18:23.050]
Yeah.

[02:18:24.130 --> 02:18:25.650]
And he's got a little critique.

[02:18:25.650 --> 02:18:34.650]
He says, I've got some comments on some of the present and past hosts and hostesses as in Twinkies.

[02:18:35.410 --> 02:18:36.310]
Kathy West.

[02:18:36.810 --> 02:18:37.290]
Ooh.

[02:18:37.630 --> 02:18:39.230]
She was a very horny person.

[02:18:39.230 --> 02:18:42.890]
From the way she spoke, she gave me a dangerous blank.

[02:18:43.090 --> 02:18:44.990]
I don't want to, um, yeah.

[02:18:44.990 --> 02:18:46.810]
A dangerous, yeah, I get it.

[02:18:46.930 --> 02:18:47.310]
Direction.

[02:18:47.590 --> 02:18:49.010]
I can say that.

[02:18:49.250 --> 02:18:50.870]
I guess we just can't shot.

[02:18:51.110 --> 02:18:51.670]
Says it.

[02:18:51.990 --> 02:18:52.810]
Do you say that?

[02:18:52.890 --> 02:18:54.370]
Do you talk about erections when he was here?

[02:18:54.390 --> 02:18:55.570]
I'm saying on him.

[02:18:56.390 --> 02:18:57.510]
Glenn Hill, the vulture.

[02:19:01.770 --> 02:19:03.310]
Go ahead, I can handle it.

[02:19:03.470 --> 02:19:07.150]
He has a very preposterous laugh, but in my opinion, he's okay.

[02:19:07.410 --> 02:19:08.310]
Don't get rid of him.

[02:19:09.390 --> 02:19:10.730]
Well, at least he's half right.

[02:19:12.990 --> 02:19:13.750]
Stan Major.

[02:19:14.070 --> 02:19:15.010]
You can put it right over there.

[02:19:15.090 --> 02:19:16.210]
Thank you.

[02:19:16.510 --> 02:19:24.490]
Stan Major, he's a low down scum of the earth, yellow belly, egg sucking, double crossing, two timing, cold blooded degenerate.

[02:19:26.170 --> 02:19:28.670]
I like these guys with a right to the point, you know what I'm saying?

[02:19:28.870 --> 02:19:29.550]
Cut through.

[02:19:29.850 --> 02:19:30.170]
Exactly.

[02:19:30.870 --> 02:19:31.290]
Get right.

[02:19:31.350 --> 02:19:33.790]
And he says, we love you and freeport have a wonderful life.

[02:19:34.650 --> 02:19:35.410]
Good job, Max.

[02:19:35.610 --> 02:19:35.810]
Excellent.

[02:19:35.990 --> 02:19:37.470]
Right to the point, right on target, too.

[02:19:37.550 --> 02:19:38.510]
Very perspicacious.

[02:19:40.990 --> 02:19:41.790]
Boy, there's Michael.

[02:19:41.830 --> 02:19:42.730]
Look at Michael here.

[02:19:42.910 --> 02:19:44.730]
Got his Michael Jackson glove on.

[02:19:45.630 --> 02:19:48.090]
I can't believe that people would put this picture in here.

[02:19:48.090 --> 02:19:49.030]
Look at that.

[02:19:50.110 --> 02:19:50.810]
You know what I say?

[02:19:50.810 --> 02:19:51.690]
He's in a dark alley.

[02:19:51.730 --> 02:19:52.550]
Oh, I'm telling you.

[02:19:53.210 --> 02:19:56.670]
I don't know why he's got a Michael Jackson glove because he ain't going to do anything with it.

[02:19:56.730 --> 02:19:57.230]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:19:58.370 --> 02:20:00.050]
There's nothing there, just like smooth.

[02:20:00.210 --> 02:20:01.270]
You know, like Michael J. Fox.

[02:20:03.910 --> 02:20:06.910]
Boy, is he really alive or is it just like a robot?

[02:20:07.430 --> 02:20:08.430]
Is he like Max Headroom?

[02:20:08.610 --> 02:20:08.810]
Yeah.

[02:20:08.810 --> 02:20:11.210]
You know, I can't rule that out.

[02:20:11.250 --> 02:20:12.770]
There's something strange there.

[02:20:12.930 --> 02:20:13.890]
Yeah, I can't rule out.

[02:20:14.070 --> 02:20:15.710]
They just changed the way he looks.

[02:20:15.790 --> 02:20:18.430]
It's not like a facelift, but they're like different body parts.

[02:20:18.670 --> 02:20:20.750]
They, you know, change from one spot to another.

[02:20:22.150 --> 02:20:25.550]
Just, I wonder what body part that Clifton has changed used to be.

[02:20:26.550 --> 02:20:26.990]
Okay.

[02:20:30.110 --> 02:20:35.870]
You know, Michael reminds me that top 10 most sexy guys that we had a few years ago in Max Headroom

[02:20:35.870 --> 02:20:36.970]
was like, yeah, seven.

[02:20:36.970 --> 02:20:38.030]
But he'd be bad.

[02:20:38.850 --> 02:20:40.170]
Okay, look at those day lines.

[02:20:40.190 --> 02:20:41.770]
Couple of lines are not flashing now.

[02:20:41.770 --> 02:20:43.250]
And that hurt when that happens.

[02:20:43.270 --> 02:20:44.090]
Oh, that's beautiful.

[02:20:44.250 --> 02:20:44.850]
What does that say?

[02:20:45.090 --> 02:20:46.930]
A pineapple, cherry, blueberry cheesecake.

[02:20:47.050 --> 02:20:48.350]
Am I right?

[02:20:48.590 --> 02:20:49.190]
And strawberry.

[02:20:49.370 --> 02:20:51.830]
Oh, I'm going to just say quad actor.

[02:20:52.950 --> 02:20:53.370]
Excellent.

[02:20:53.530 --> 02:20:55.490]
Well, let's think of you cause while we're getting ready to eat.

[02:20:56.110 --> 02:20:56.790]
Broward County.

[02:20:56.790 --> 02:20:57.130]
Hello.

[02:20:57.930 --> 02:20:59.030]
Yeah, my own ear.

[02:20:59.350 --> 02:21:00.370]
Sure sounds like it.

[02:21:00.630 --> 02:21:00.850]
Yeah.

[02:21:01.370 --> 02:21:02.430]
No, Michael Jackson.

[02:21:02.570 --> 02:21:03.350]
Jeez, what a jerk.

[02:21:03.670 --> 02:21:04.730]
I go to the Georgia Tech.

[02:21:05.330 --> 02:21:05.470]
Okay.

[02:21:05.470 --> 02:21:06.730]
Georgia Tech.

[02:21:07.270 --> 02:21:07.890]
Yes, the guy.

[02:21:08.290 --> 02:21:08.590]
Wait a minute.

[02:21:08.730 --> 02:21:08.950]
Wait a minute.

[02:21:09.090 --> 02:21:10.870]
Is this the rambling wreck from Georgia Tech?

[02:21:11.210 --> 02:21:11.650]
Yes, it is.

[02:21:12.010 --> 02:21:12.310]
Okay.

[02:21:12.630 --> 02:21:14.550]
My name is Georgia P. Broward County.

[02:21:14.570 --> 02:21:14.690]
Yes.

[02:21:15.350 --> 02:21:15.550]
No.

[02:21:15.990 --> 02:21:16.550]
You're Dell?

[02:21:17.070 --> 02:21:17.750]
Broward County.

[02:21:18.910 --> 02:21:19.550]
Never mind.

[02:21:19.650 --> 02:21:20.250]
You'll never get it.

[02:21:20.870 --> 02:21:20.990]
No.

[02:21:21.350 --> 02:21:24.190]
He actually owns the rites to the rambling wreck song.

[02:21:24.470 --> 02:21:24.770]
Okay.

[02:21:25.130 --> 02:21:25.710]
Give me a break.

[02:21:25.890 --> 02:21:30.710]
Every time we play the song of football game since admission is charged to the game, he gets

[02:21:30.710 --> 02:21:31.270]
a cut of it.

[02:21:31.730 --> 02:21:32.970]
I mean, what a jerk.

[02:21:33.810 --> 02:21:34.130]
Yeah.

[02:21:34.770 --> 02:21:35.490]
What a nerd.

[02:21:36.510 --> 02:21:37.570]
I tell you.

[02:21:37.710 --> 02:21:37.810]
Yes.

[02:21:38.750 --> 02:21:40.070]
Let's not catch him on campus.

[02:21:40.530 --> 02:21:41.570]
You'll be out of there in a second.

[02:21:41.770 --> 02:21:45.310]
Yeah, you wouldn't want to run in to him in the dark alley right behind the dorm, would you?

[02:21:45.590 --> 02:21:49.210]
No, my fact is the dorms right across the street from what we've come housing.

[02:21:49.790 --> 02:21:50.190]
Oh, yeah.

[02:21:50.410 --> 02:21:52.070]
We've got a lot of his roles to do over there.

[02:21:53.410 --> 02:21:55.170]
Hey, by the way, I mean you.

[02:21:55.270 --> 02:21:56.490]
You don't really mean that, do you?

[02:21:56.670 --> 02:21:58.970]
You don't really mean what you said.

[02:21:59.350 --> 02:22:04.050]
You don't want to come across as a stereotypical Georgia Redneck, do you?

[02:22:04.130 --> 02:22:06.730]
Hey, if the shoe fits where?

[02:22:06.850 --> 02:22:07.170]
Okay.

[02:22:07.530 --> 02:22:08.770]
Now that's what I like, he's honesty.

[02:22:09.330 --> 02:22:11.090]
You know, once a Redneck, always a Redneck.

[02:22:11.930 --> 02:22:13.850]
I mean, let's face the way.

[02:22:14.010 --> 02:22:17.130]
Live in Washington, DC for a couple of years to see how you feel.

[02:22:19.970 --> 02:22:22.330]
Anyway, by the way, I mean, I'm here.

[02:22:22.390 --> 02:22:25.370]
Sounds like he'd have a lot of fun in Davie on the weekends with some of those.

[02:22:25.370 --> 02:22:26.430]
No, that's not from Colin from now.

[02:22:26.430 --> 02:22:30.110]
Some of those per-kail sheets that they were in Davie.

[02:22:30.370 --> 02:22:32.890]
I mean, we got the heat since we got everything out here.

[02:22:33.010 --> 02:22:33.190]
Yeah.

[02:22:34.730 --> 02:22:36.830]
Oh, well, I was going to put my two cents in.

[02:22:37.030 --> 02:22:38.590]
Okay, well, good luck to you.

[02:22:38.690 --> 02:22:39.810]
We'll see you at Los Finer, Delhi.

[02:22:40.830 --> 02:22:41.970]
Let's go to date County.

[02:22:42.090 --> 02:22:42.270]
Hello.

[02:22:42.830 --> 02:22:43.190]
Hello.

[02:22:43.530 --> 02:22:43.670]
Yeah.

[02:22:44.150 --> 02:22:44.470]
Neil?

[02:22:44.810 --> 02:22:45.150]
Yes, sir.

[02:22:45.670 --> 02:22:45.810]
Hi.

[02:22:46.730 --> 02:22:48.190]
I just welcome home.

[02:22:48.610 --> 02:22:49.250]
Thank you, someone.

[02:22:49.450 --> 02:22:53.990]
And I want to, in all fairness, you know, Glen Hill did a great job for you while you were going.

[02:22:53.990 --> 02:22:54.470]
I know.

[02:22:55.010 --> 02:22:56.270]
It a hell of a good job.

[02:22:56.350 --> 02:22:58.130]
You know, considering all things equal.

[02:22:58.390 --> 02:23:02.370]
Yeah, you know, he had one call during the week that gave him, you know, it's better than none.

[02:23:03.050 --> 02:23:04.990]
Yeah, he had a terrific play on words.

[02:23:05.730 --> 02:23:07.650]
I don't know whether he told you about it or not.

[02:23:08.570 --> 02:23:13.870]
He said that when the Pope is here and he's giving him that, you and Stan should be there.

[02:23:14.990 --> 02:23:19.170]
And if he's like, says it in a Latin or anything and people don't understand,

[02:23:19.850 --> 02:23:21.970]
they ought to have somebody standing with you and Stan.

[02:23:21.970 --> 02:23:28.850]
And when the Pope says somebody should Neil hold the thing over your head and they'll Neil, you know.

[02:23:30.150 --> 02:23:33.810]
And then when they want him to stand up, you know, Stan said.

[02:23:34.730 --> 02:23:35.730]
That's a clever question.

[02:23:35.890 --> 02:23:36.710]
Yeah, good line.

[02:23:38.070 --> 02:23:38.550]
Great.

[02:23:39.470 --> 02:23:40.550]
Okay, Neil, thank you.

[02:23:40.830 --> 02:23:41.510]
Thanks so much.

[02:23:41.610 --> 02:23:43.250]
I guess it was good the first time.

[02:23:43.390 --> 02:23:45.990]
Yeah, it was a caller that said that and we laughed.

[02:23:47.430 --> 02:23:47.510]
Huh?

[02:23:48.530 --> 02:23:49.910]
Okay, let's go to Broward.

[02:23:49.950 --> 02:23:50.150]
Hello.

[02:23:50.150 --> 02:23:50.830]
Hello.

[02:23:51.170 --> 02:23:51.390]
Yeah.

[02:23:51.630 --> 02:23:51.890]
Neil?

[02:23:52.290 --> 02:23:52.990]
Yes, ma'am.

[02:23:53.350 --> 02:23:54.550]
I'm going to throw this at you.

[02:23:54.850 --> 02:23:57.150]
I had my civil rights violated yesterday.

[02:23:57.970 --> 02:24:04.050]
I went down to Tammy Amie Pott to shoot pictures of the cross where the Pope is showing up.

[02:24:04.450 --> 02:24:08.370]
I had a secret service man and a Metro day policeman.

[02:24:08.750 --> 02:24:09.050]
Really?

[02:24:09.170 --> 02:24:10.050]
To escape my film.

[02:24:10.710 --> 02:24:12.150]
The confiscated the film?

[02:24:12.590 --> 02:24:13.050]
Yes, sir.

[02:24:13.310 --> 02:24:13.690]
For what?

[02:24:15.150 --> 02:24:16.130]
I don't know.

[02:24:16.910 --> 02:24:17.430]
Hmm.

[02:24:18.570 --> 02:24:23.570]
But I was on the side taking a shot outside of the, of the, uh, you were on your side?

[02:24:24.090 --> 02:24:30.650]
I was on the side of the cross, you know, not in another words you climbed up the cross to the side.

[02:24:30.770 --> 02:24:31.470]
Yes, no.

[02:24:32.250 --> 02:24:34.490]
I was way over up out there.

[02:24:34.490 --> 02:24:34.930]
What were you doing?

[02:24:35.030 --> 02:24:36.490]
Your genius imitation or what?

[02:24:37.530 --> 02:24:40.270]
I was outside of the restricted area.

[02:24:40.530 --> 02:24:40.710]
Yeah.

[02:24:41.850 --> 02:24:48.070]
And this secret service man came up and started taking his badge at me and I have tell you I was so intimidated.

[02:24:48.750 --> 02:24:49.970]
I couldn't even get his name.

[02:24:50.350 --> 02:24:50.510]
Hmm.

[02:24:51.010 --> 02:24:52.850]
And then a Metro day policeman arrived.

[02:24:54.270 --> 02:24:55.930]
And they thought neither to remove.

[02:24:56.270 --> 02:24:58.270]
Take my camera, put me in jail.

[02:24:58.990 --> 02:25:00.030]
And then he tried to cut.

[02:25:00.130 --> 02:25:04.850]
He took the camera away from me and of course it was I shoot pictures by avocation.

[02:25:05.890 --> 02:25:06.970]
I have shot pictures of the film.

[02:25:06.970 --> 02:25:08.950]
I usually use a camera myself.

[02:25:08.950 --> 02:25:11.510]
I had a roller film confiscated.

[02:25:12.190 --> 02:25:14.830]
And they confiscated it.

[02:25:15.230 --> 02:25:18.670]
This is the most disgusting program I've ever had.

[02:25:19.550 --> 02:25:21.390]
Everyone to complain to this station.

[02:25:22.410 --> 02:25:22.630]
Yeah.

[02:25:24.050 --> 02:25:25.530]
Well listen, good luck to you, ma'am.

[02:25:25.610 --> 02:25:26.650]
I hope it all works out.

[02:25:27.210 --> 02:25:28.430]
Let's go to a date county.

[02:25:28.510 --> 02:25:28.710]
Hello.

[02:25:28.970 --> 02:25:29.630]
Yeah, Neil.

[02:25:29.870 --> 02:25:30.090]
Hi.

[02:25:30.350 --> 02:25:31.850]
Hi, I got to take a little bit.

[02:25:32.010 --> 02:25:32.290]
Okay.

[02:25:32.530 --> 02:25:32.870]
Go ahead.

[02:25:33.070 --> 02:25:34.650]
Longest 10 days of my life.

[02:25:34.770 --> 02:25:35.970]
Do your Billy Carter routine.

[02:25:35.970 --> 02:25:36.790]
All right.

[02:25:36.990 --> 02:25:38.450]
We miss you and I'm glad you're back.

[02:25:38.630 --> 02:25:41.290]
And this morning I was shouting, oh it's almost time for Neil.

[02:25:41.390 --> 02:25:43.910]
Last night I said, 16 hours and 20 minutes for Neil.

[02:25:44.130 --> 02:25:44.710]
I'm glad you're home.

[02:25:45.130 --> 02:25:50.050]
Hey, I have to tell you, the other morning, the turned on Sandy the first day she was home.

[02:25:50.690 --> 02:25:51.210]
Uh-huh.

[02:25:51.630 --> 02:26:00.870]
Listen, I had to last this job in Cardin and said, you know Neil Rogers had something very nice to say about you and your son.

[02:26:01.470 --> 02:26:03.230]
And she flared back.

[02:26:03.230 --> 02:26:05.150]
She said, please never met my son.

[02:26:06.070 --> 02:26:06.850]
And he went on.

[02:26:06.850 --> 02:26:08.190]
Oh yeah, he won a bet, Sandy.

[02:26:08.490 --> 02:26:14.330]
Listen, he went on and was trying to say these nice things and she just became so defensive.

[02:26:14.910 --> 02:26:15.890]
And she yelled at me.

[02:26:16.210 --> 02:26:17.890]
And she got higher pitched than her.

[02:26:18.150 --> 02:26:19.310]
Well, how can you say that?

[02:26:19.410 --> 02:26:20.270]
You should have met my son.

[02:26:20.890 --> 02:26:22.230]
Oh, I know Jason very well.

[02:26:22.550 --> 02:26:24.770]
And then this gentleman says, well, how do you know?

[02:26:24.950 --> 02:26:26.430]
Maybe he has and she says, I'm on.

[02:26:26.530 --> 02:26:27.010]
I know my son.

[02:26:27.150 --> 02:26:27.710]
I know my son.

[02:26:27.790 --> 02:26:28.790]
He's never met my son.

[02:26:29.210 --> 02:26:31.270]
And it was really a little funny.

[02:26:31.270 --> 02:26:32.850]
So I had a light to know about.

[02:26:32.930 --> 02:26:34.510]
Well, I better have a long chat with Sandy.

[02:26:35.950 --> 02:26:37.470]
It's so good to have you home.

[02:26:37.810 --> 02:26:38.310]
Thanks a lot.

[02:26:38.350 --> 02:26:39.890]
Everybody was good but bad shots.

[02:26:41.330 --> 02:26:41.670]
Okay.

[02:26:41.930 --> 02:26:43.090]
What do you do? Talk, Dirty?

[02:26:43.730 --> 02:26:45.270]
No, I just don't like him.

[02:26:45.870 --> 02:26:47.290]
I don't like a little butt shot.

[02:26:47.650 --> 02:26:49.530]
But Clan was very good.

[02:26:49.990 --> 02:26:51.270]
He was really, really good.

[02:26:51.490 --> 02:26:54.690]
Yeah, well, that gives me, you know, kind of a barometer to judge all the rest of it by.

[02:26:54.890 --> 02:26:55.690]
We're glad you're home.

[02:26:55.990 --> 02:26:56.410]
Thank you.

[02:26:56.470 --> 02:26:56.750]
All right.

[02:26:56.910 --> 02:26:57.230]
Okay.

[02:26:57.810 --> 02:26:58.150]
See you.

[02:26:58.150 --> 02:26:59.030]
You know Jason, don't you?

[02:26:59.230 --> 02:26:59.510]
Sure.

[02:27:01.350 --> 02:27:04.830]
I'm going to hang around at FM Studio up there when it was I-95.

[02:27:04.990 --> 02:27:05.290]
Mm-hmm.

[02:27:05.470 --> 02:27:05.870]
Will he be?

[02:27:05.870 --> 02:27:08.110]
I know that the Zord even loves Neil Rogers.

[02:27:08.870 --> 02:27:09.110]
Okay.

[02:27:09.230 --> 02:27:10.730]
Let's take him in Broward.

[02:27:10.830 --> 02:27:10.990]
Hello.

[02:27:11.330 --> 02:27:11.610]
Hi, Neil.

[02:27:11.950 --> 02:27:12.310]
How are you doing?

[02:27:12.510 --> 02:27:15.090]
I got some information on your old buddy, Bobby Lester.

[02:27:15.430 --> 02:27:15.770]
Yeah.

[02:27:16.150 --> 02:27:20.990]
He used to go on computer BPS, you know, over the telephone.

[02:27:21.190 --> 02:27:23.930]
You'd link your computer up with other computers around the county.

[02:27:24.710 --> 02:27:27.510]
And he used to use the handle cookie man.

[02:27:28.170 --> 02:27:31.210]
Next time you talk to him, tell him, take a little cookie man.

[02:27:31.550 --> 02:27:32.250]
That'll blow his mind.

[02:27:32.490 --> 02:27:33.130]
Are you serious?

[02:27:33.410 --> 02:27:33.910]
I am serious.

[02:27:34.230 --> 02:27:35.770]
What do you used to know me as a fuzz man?

[02:27:37.050 --> 02:27:38.510]
The cookie man and the fuzz man.

[02:27:38.630 --> 02:27:39.310]
I'm the fuzz man.

[02:27:39.470 --> 02:27:40.770]
His handle was cookie man.

[02:27:40.850 --> 02:27:41.790]
Everybody used handles.

[02:27:41.910 --> 02:27:43.570]
Sounds like something pornographic to me.

[02:27:45.350 --> 02:27:46.310]
No, not quite.

[02:27:46.510 --> 02:27:51.930]
He was a real, uh, he cranked up the kids on the computers and argue with him about, uh,

[02:27:51.930 --> 02:27:55.190]
those counter-aid and all sorts of political things.

[02:27:55.370 --> 02:27:57.130]
And he'd have everybody on down on his throat.

[02:27:57.370 --> 02:27:59.350]
He'd cause all sorts of trouble on the computer.

[02:27:59.410 --> 02:28:02.270]
You mean he was doing a CB talk show, is that it?

[02:28:02.830 --> 02:28:04.690]
Yeah, sort of a CB only via computer.

[02:28:04.950 --> 02:28:05.110]
Yeah.

[02:28:05.470 --> 02:28:06.390]
And, you know, it was the way.

[02:28:06.390 --> 02:28:07.230]
Well, it would be good on CB.

[02:28:07.950 --> 02:28:08.190]
Yeah.

[02:28:08.270 --> 02:28:09.430]
On Channel 9, he'd be great.

[02:28:09.590 --> 02:28:09.690]
Yeah.

[02:28:09.930 --> 02:28:11.950]
So if you have it, welcome again, call him cookie man.

[02:28:12.110 --> 02:28:14.770]
It'll blow his mind how you ever found out what his handle was.

[02:28:14.810 --> 02:28:16.570]
Okay, when we give his home number out of the year tomorrow,

[02:28:16.810 --> 02:28:18.890]
everybody can call him at home and say, hi, cookie man.

[02:28:19.050 --> 02:28:20.270]
I would love to call him.

[02:28:20.270 --> 02:28:23.150]
I haven't spoken to him in about three years when he used to live on the East Coast.

[02:28:23.490 --> 02:28:23.710]
Really?

[02:28:24.090 --> 02:28:24.230]
Yeah.

[02:28:24.390 --> 02:28:25.870]
We got friendly through the computer.

[02:28:26.750 --> 02:28:29.290]
And, uh, you know, he told me what his real name was eventually.

[02:28:29.770 --> 02:28:30.130]
Oh, no.

[02:28:31.390 --> 02:28:31.770]
Wow.

[02:28:32.970 --> 02:28:34.550]
And also one last thing.

[02:28:35.110 --> 02:28:38.070]
Jeff Stryken now has a, uh, straight pointer out.

[02:28:38.770 --> 02:28:39.010]
Really?

[02:28:39.450 --> 02:28:40.890]
Yeah, it's called the big switch.

[02:28:41.510 --> 02:28:41.970]
Not the switch.

[02:28:42.350 --> 02:28:42.550]
Yeah.

[02:28:42.850 --> 02:28:43.750]
The big switch in his...

[02:28:43.750 --> 02:28:46.230]
Well, there would be a big switch for him to know a question about that.

[02:28:47.110 --> 02:28:48.750]
No, I think basically is straight.

[02:28:48.750 --> 02:28:51.830]
If you've seen his, uh, his homo pornos, they're, uh...

[02:28:51.830 --> 02:28:52.270]
Is what?

[02:28:52.830 --> 02:28:53.490]
Is what?

[02:28:54.030 --> 02:28:54.030]

[02:28:54.890 --> 02:28:56.230]
He just gets done.

[02:28:57.670 --> 02:28:59.170]
His homo pornos?

[02:28:59.410 --> 02:28:59.970]
He's gay pornos.

[02:29:00.650 --> 02:29:01.730]
If you've ever watched him.

[02:29:01.730 --> 02:29:02.750]
You mean his, his queer...

[02:29:02.750 --> 02:29:03.330]
I'm sure you have.

[02:29:03.690 --> 02:29:05.450]
His queer, uh, pornos.

[02:29:05.690 --> 02:29:06.630]
Well, his gay pornos.

[02:29:08.050 --> 02:29:10.910]
As I say, he doesn't do anything.

[02:29:11.170 --> 02:29:12.610]
He just gets, he's a receiver.

[02:29:12.930 --> 02:29:13.090]
Yeah.

[02:29:13.510 --> 02:29:14.630]
Well, he does look a little...

[02:29:14.630 --> 02:29:18.490]
He looks a little like the passive type to me, you know.

[02:29:18.490 --> 02:29:18.970]
Yeah.

[02:29:19.290 --> 02:29:19.610]
Okay.

[02:29:19.830 --> 02:29:20.830]
Did you ever get your poster?

[02:29:21.590 --> 02:29:21.910]
No.

[02:29:22.110 --> 02:29:22.870]
I've never gotten...

[02:29:22.870 --> 02:29:24.510]
No, never got the Jeff Strike or poster.

[02:29:24.610 --> 02:29:25.730]
And we're very upset about that.

[02:29:25.810 --> 02:29:26.890]
I milled in like a book.

[02:29:27.170 --> 02:29:27.170]

[02:29:27.170 --> 02:29:29.070]
And, uh, requested one, two from the fan club.

[02:29:29.130 --> 02:29:30.390]
Okay, well, we'll see what happens.

[02:29:31.190 --> 02:29:34.130]
Yeah, we better give that to Kamel Kaffirut, who, uh, who's that's the gay?

[02:29:34.430 --> 02:29:37.030]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

[02:29:37.530 --> 02:29:39.370]
Either that or ran Bishop, one or the other.

[02:29:39.590 --> 02:29:40.350]
Or for free, yeah, right.

[02:29:40.570 --> 02:29:40.570]

[02:29:40.970 --> 02:29:41.830]
Okay, thanks a lot.

[02:29:41.930 --> 02:29:42.470]
Okay, Neal bite.

[02:29:42.570 --> 02:29:43.430]
Okay, well, look at that.

[02:29:43.470 --> 02:29:44.690]
We've got pizza from Brickovan.

[02:29:44.770 --> 02:29:46.410]
We've got, um...

[02:29:46.410 --> 02:29:48.210]
Cheesecake from Cheesecake, etc.

[02:29:48.710 --> 02:29:49.390]
KeeLime Pie.

[02:29:49.810 --> 02:29:50.630]
And KeeLime Pie.

[02:29:51.190 --> 02:29:52.850]
We've got special cake for Stan.

[02:29:53.870 --> 02:29:54.470]
What is it?

[02:29:55.490 --> 02:29:56.270]
That's a secret.

[02:29:57.410 --> 02:29:59.150]
Yeah, it's Stan listening.

[02:29:59.770 --> 02:30:00.490]
Hey, he's probably listening.

[02:30:00.590 --> 02:30:01.670]
Oh, he's on his way now.

[02:30:01.770 --> 02:30:02.350]
Oh, he's listening.

[02:30:02.770 --> 02:30:03.030]
Okay.

[02:30:03.390 --> 02:30:05.730]
Oh, is that the one that says Ding Dong School on top of it?

[02:30:05.930 --> 02:30:05.990]
Yeah.

[02:30:06.190 --> 02:30:07.310]
Incredible. He'll go nuts with it.

[02:30:07.310 --> 02:30:08.090]
He'll hobby horse.

[02:30:08.330 --> 02:30:08.490]
Yeah.

[02:30:08.990 --> 02:30:10.090]
Date County. Hello.

[02:30:11.530 --> 02:30:11.970]
He'll?

[02:30:12.270 --> 02:30:12.570]
Yes.

[02:30:13.350 --> 02:30:15.590]
I just wanted to tell you that, um,

[02:30:15.590 --> 02:30:17.550]
Sandy Paton's...

[02:30:17.550 --> 02:30:19.750]
son's name is Jared, not Jason.

[02:30:19.990 --> 02:30:20.670]
Well, I was close.

[02:30:21.010 --> 02:30:21.710]
You were close, right?

[02:30:21.830 --> 02:30:23.410]
And I saw you yesterday at Calder.

[02:30:23.670 --> 02:30:23.850]
Yeah.

[02:30:23.990 --> 02:30:24.630]
I wanted him.

[02:30:24.910 --> 02:30:25.810]
You were sitting outside.

[02:30:26.450 --> 02:30:27.490]
Did I look real depressed?

[02:30:28.150 --> 02:30:28.390]
No.

[02:30:28.770 --> 02:30:29.310]
It looked good.

[02:30:29.590 --> 02:30:30.590]
Oh, I was so depressed.

[02:30:31.010 --> 02:30:32.050]
No, I...

[02:30:32.050 --> 02:30:32.170]
I...

[02:30:32.170 --> 02:30:33.450]
I might go Lee in the ninth race.

[02:30:33.470 --> 02:30:35.370]
I'll never forget that as long as I live.

[02:30:35.570 --> 02:30:36.610]
In ninth race, I...

[02:30:36.610 --> 02:30:37.930]
I don't remember the...

[02:30:37.930 --> 02:30:38.690]
The sixth horse.

[02:30:39.370 --> 02:30:40.590]
Which, uh, I remember...

[02:30:41.450 --> 02:30:42.570]
a blazing bark.

[02:30:42.950 --> 02:30:44.990]
No, no. That was the tenth race with Heraburto.

[02:30:45.690 --> 02:30:46.050]
Oh.

[02:30:46.350 --> 02:30:47.590]
Is today Stan's birthday?

[02:30:48.790 --> 02:30:49.370]
Oh, well...

[02:30:50.190 --> 02:30:51.930]
I wanted to come over, but...

[02:30:51.930 --> 02:30:52.150]
You...

[02:30:52.670 --> 02:30:53.990]
But I tell you, you say...

[02:30:54.530 --> 02:30:56.730]
You don't like people to bother you with.

[02:30:56.750 --> 02:30:57.850]
No, everybody...

[02:30:57.850 --> 02:30:58.550]
You would have been great.

[02:30:58.670 --> 02:30:59.990]
My husband not let me come over and...

[02:31:00.730 --> 02:31:02.110]
and tell you...

[02:31:02.110 --> 02:31:04.350]
who I liked in that one race and...

[02:31:04.350 --> 02:31:04.750]
it won.

[02:31:05.350 --> 02:31:06.110]
Who... who was it?

[02:31:06.570 --> 02:31:07.570]
I think it was called...

[02:31:07.570 --> 02:31:08.410]
I'm not a better...

[02:31:08.410 --> 02:31:08.990]
a medieval road.

[02:31:09.850 --> 02:31:10.050]
I've been waiting.

[02:31:10.070 --> 02:31:11.310]
Yeah, that was the horse that was claimed.

[02:31:11.450 --> 02:31:12.510]
He went off at five to one.

[02:31:12.750 --> 02:31:12.970]
Oh.

[02:31:12.970 --> 02:31:15.730]
And my good friend Lester Greenshir told me...

[02:31:15.730 --> 02:31:17.630]
after the race that John Tamarro claimed them.

[02:31:17.650 --> 02:31:18.970]
If he would have told me before the race...

[02:31:19.490 --> 02:31:22.230]
I had the two four in that race and it came forward too.

[02:31:22.610 --> 02:31:24.330]
That's how it went all day yesterday for me.

[02:31:24.350 --> 02:31:25.110]
I know, but...

[02:31:25.110 --> 02:31:26.650]
It's a story of my life at Colter.

[02:31:26.970 --> 02:31:28.010]
I want to tell you about the...

[02:31:28.010 --> 02:31:29.110]
the daily gubble.

[02:31:30.130 --> 02:31:30.490]
Um...

[02:31:30.490 --> 02:31:32.830]
As soon as my husband met, he said to me...

[02:31:32.830 --> 02:31:33.430]
Oh, my...

[02:31:33.430 --> 02:31:34.650]
well, the race had just started.

[02:31:34.750 --> 02:31:35.070]
He said,

[02:31:35.490 --> 02:31:36.630]
Camaro and Gonzalez,

[02:31:36.670 --> 02:31:38.310]
I have two of them that you've got.

[02:31:38.470 --> 02:31:39.010]
I have to bet.

[02:31:39.470 --> 02:31:40.650]
And he already had bet to me.

[02:31:40.670 --> 02:31:41.650]
I said, why don't you tell me?

[02:31:41.650 --> 02:31:42.310]
Yeah.

[02:31:42.530 --> 02:31:46.190]
Because then he proceeded to have three in a row...

[02:31:46.190 --> 02:31:46.650]
and then one later...

[02:31:47.450 --> 02:31:48.890]
Yeah, I have the one later.

[02:31:48.990 --> 02:31:49.670]
The twelve horse, yeah.

[02:31:49.990 --> 02:31:51.450]
And I have the second half,

[02:31:52.110 --> 02:31:52.510]
but...

[02:31:52.510 --> 02:31:53.990]
And the pick six, I just...

[02:31:53.990 --> 02:31:55.370]
I didn't do very well.

[02:31:55.570 --> 02:31:55.690]
Yeah.

[02:31:55.830 --> 02:31:57.150]
Well, I had the first three winners...

[02:31:57.150 --> 02:31:59.730]
and from there on in it was drastically downhill.

[02:32:00.450 --> 02:32:00.810]
I know.

[02:32:00.810 --> 02:32:01.490]
From medically.

[02:32:01.670 --> 02:32:02.790]
And I wasn't able to do it.

[02:32:02.790 --> 02:32:03.410]
But I know you...

[02:32:03.410 --> 02:32:04.550]
I didn't want to bother you.

[02:32:04.830 --> 02:32:06.630]
But the next time if I see you, I will.

[02:32:06.850 --> 02:32:08.010]
Well, that'll be at Hylia.

[02:32:08.210 --> 02:32:08.610]
Hylia.

[02:32:09.090 --> 02:32:09.810]
Oh, okay.

[02:32:10.090 --> 02:32:10.390]
Okay.

[02:32:10.390 --> 02:32:11.350]
We're talking to him.

[02:32:11.410 --> 02:32:11.990]
Grant your back.

[02:32:12.210 --> 02:32:12.630]
Thanks a lot.

[02:32:12.710 --> 02:32:13.350]
Really missed you.

[02:32:13.510 --> 02:32:14.450]
And I'm from Hallendale,

[02:32:14.570 --> 02:32:15.970]
even though I'm calling you on a date number.

[02:32:16.190 --> 02:32:16.450]
Okay.

[02:32:16.770 --> 02:32:18.070]
Okay. Bye-bye.

[02:32:18.350 --> 02:32:18.730]
See you later.

[02:32:20.150 --> 02:32:23.190]
Boy, I don't know how many candles he has,

[02:32:23.430 --> 02:32:24.390]
but not enough.

[02:32:24.670 --> 02:32:25.230]
I don't think so.

[02:32:25.270 --> 02:32:26.650]
They haven't made enough candles.

[02:32:28.990 --> 02:32:29.410]
Doonsbury.

[02:32:32.230 --> 02:32:35.070]
At the Phoenix Shopping Center.

[02:32:42.370 --> 02:32:42.770]
Great.

[02:32:43.230 --> 02:32:44.690]
That's the thing about the governor out there.

[02:32:44.890 --> 02:32:45.050]
Good.

[02:32:45.670 --> 02:32:46.030]
Boring.

[02:32:46.730 --> 02:32:48.990]
We don't give a damn about Phoenix or Arizona

[02:32:48.990 --> 02:32:50.270]
or any place with cactus.

[02:32:50.510 --> 02:32:51.490]
We don't care about that.

[02:32:51.630 --> 02:32:53.290]
I'm just informing you that, Saul.

[02:32:53.370 --> 02:32:54.190]
Did you hear about the...

[02:32:54.190 --> 02:32:56.450]
A letter we got from my fan in the Bahamas?

[02:32:56.650 --> 02:32:56.830]
Yeah.

[02:32:57.050 --> 02:32:57.910]
Is it a 50-cent bill?

[02:32:58.230 --> 02:32:58.870]
Big fan of mine.

[02:32:59.030 --> 02:33:01.370]
He said you're a low-down scum of the earth,

[02:33:01.590 --> 02:33:03.850]
yellow belly, egg-sucking, double-crossing,

[02:33:03.990 --> 02:33:05.390]
two-timing, cold-blooded degenerate.

[02:33:06.850 --> 02:33:07.150]
Okay.

[02:33:08.190 --> 02:33:09.590]
I don't know about cold-blooded.

[02:33:11.750 --> 02:33:13.770]
Can we borrow your lighter for a second?

[02:33:15.350 --> 02:33:15.950]
Thank you.

[02:33:16.670 --> 02:33:18.190]
I think you need some more food in here.

[02:33:18.710 --> 02:33:18.850]
Yeah.

[02:33:19.590 --> 02:33:20.710]
Well, you know that I'm back.

[02:33:20.930 --> 02:33:21.870]
You got sweets, Stan.

[02:33:22.030 --> 02:33:23.250]
You got everything that you like.

[02:33:23.410 --> 02:33:24.570]
We have cakes and pizzas.

[02:33:24.990 --> 02:33:25.050]
Yeah.

[02:33:25.630 --> 02:33:26.510]
You name all your face.

[02:33:26.590 --> 02:33:28.710]
Well, I love this stuff about four o'clock in the afternoon.

[02:33:28.850 --> 02:33:30.030]
Not at one o'clock.

[02:33:30.730 --> 02:33:31.290]
Why not?

[02:33:31.750 --> 02:33:33.050]
Because you just crawled out of the sand.

[02:33:33.050 --> 02:33:33.730]
Just crawled out of the sand.

[02:33:33.790 --> 02:33:33.910]
Yeah.

[02:33:34.190 --> 02:33:34.330]
Boy.

[02:33:35.190 --> 02:33:36.570]
That's why I couldn't talk this morning.

[02:33:36.570 --> 02:33:37.390]
I slept too late.

[02:33:38.130 --> 02:33:39.650]
I slept till 8.30.

[02:33:39.850 --> 02:33:40.430]
Good lord.

[02:33:40.670 --> 02:33:40.810]
Yeah.

[02:33:41.270 --> 02:33:41.890]
That's like a lot of work.

[02:33:41.890 --> 02:33:43.130]
I didn't leave the house till 9 o'clock.

[02:33:43.190 --> 02:33:43.670]
Oh, boy.

[02:33:43.810 --> 02:33:44.750]
Well, I had made up my mind.

[02:33:44.870 --> 02:33:47.110]
I'm not, you know, I'm going to put it off as long as I can.

[02:33:47.630 --> 02:33:48.330]
And you did.

[02:33:48.590 --> 02:33:48.990]
You bet.

[02:33:49.610 --> 02:33:51.930]
That's why you didn't unlock the office, huh?

[02:33:52.210 --> 02:33:52.350]
Yeah.

[02:33:52.510 --> 02:33:53.510]
Being that time to do that.

[02:33:54.390 --> 02:33:56.150]
So you haven't seen the rearranged furniture.

[02:33:56.470 --> 02:33:56.990]
Oh, great.

[02:33:57.470 --> 02:33:58.270]
I can hardly wait.

[02:33:58.810 --> 02:34:00.690]
And while I'm eating lunch, you can do the rest of the show.

[02:34:00.690 --> 02:34:02.870]
And I'll have a little pizza and go look at me in office.

[02:34:03.690 --> 02:34:04.630]
Let's take a break here.

[02:34:04.630 --> 02:34:06.010]
There are 124 at W.I.

[02:34:06.110 --> 02:34:09.230]
You're nearly no two on the show besides eating, coming up.

[02:34:15.890 --> 02:34:17.430]
No, this deal's not the same.

[02:34:19.250 --> 02:34:19.770]
Happy.

[02:34:22.170 --> 02:34:23.210]
Dearly generous.

[02:34:25.730 --> 02:34:27.610]
Run, run, run.

[02:34:29.890 --> 02:34:30.410]
Be.

[02:34:32.950 --> 02:34:35.310]
Ray, never get all those candles blown out.

[02:34:35.310 --> 02:34:36.010]
Boy, they had a celebration.

[02:34:36.010 --> 02:34:37.430]
I hear the country walk.

[02:34:37.790 --> 02:34:39.570]
Nursery this morning is incredible.

[02:34:40.330 --> 02:34:40.810]
Unbelievable.

[02:34:41.070 --> 02:34:42.750]
All the little kids were blowing out the candles.

[02:34:43.510 --> 02:34:45.370]
Wishing happy birthday to Uncle Stan.

[02:34:48.310 --> 02:34:50.670]
What is it, 39, like Joey Reynolds?

[02:34:50.850 --> 02:34:51.650]
Yeah, something like that.

[02:34:52.630 --> 02:34:53.030]
Mm-hmm.

[02:34:53.330 --> 02:34:53.650]
Okay.

[02:34:54.010 --> 02:34:54.810]
Blow out the candles.

[02:34:55.110 --> 02:34:56.470]
They're melting the great chocolate.

[02:34:56.470 --> 02:34:57.410]
Go ahead.

[02:34:57.410 --> 02:34:58.110]
You look great, John.

[02:35:00.290 --> 02:35:00.950]
All right.

[02:35:01.650 --> 02:35:02.050]
Good.

[02:35:02.650 --> 02:35:03.770]
Why four candles?

[02:35:04.790 --> 02:35:05.190]
Four.

[02:35:05.630 --> 02:35:06.390]
Four years old.

[02:35:06.470 --> 02:35:07.310]
He's in four years old.

[02:35:07.350 --> 02:35:07.790]
Very good.

[02:35:07.890 --> 02:35:08.890]
He can't just be on very quick.

[02:35:09.390 --> 02:35:11.030]
He'll let's take a couple of calls.

[02:35:11.210 --> 02:35:13.410]
And when you call in, stand today with the Mark Mosley,

[02:35:13.550 --> 02:35:16.490]
you might want to wish Stan happy birthday or not as a case maybe.

[02:35:17.590 --> 02:35:18.710]
Nate County, hello.

[02:35:19.650 --> 02:35:19.950]
Yes.

[02:35:20.330 --> 02:35:20.470]
Hello.

[02:35:20.790 --> 02:35:21.010]
Yes.

[02:35:22.270 --> 02:35:22.910]
Yeah, Neil?

[02:35:23.330 --> 02:35:23.930]
Let me say it again.

[02:35:24.070 --> 02:35:24.230]
Yes.

[02:35:25.050 --> 02:35:26.690]
This is for my ass.

[02:35:27.030 --> 02:35:27.510]
No.

[02:35:28.070 --> 02:35:28.550]
Come on.

[02:35:28.550 --> 02:35:28.830]
Yes.

[02:35:29.310 --> 02:35:30.250]
My favorite, look.

[02:35:30.330 --> 02:35:31.290]
Would you put me on, sir?

[02:35:31.670 --> 02:35:31.910]
No.

[02:35:32.310 --> 02:35:32.790]
Love it.

[02:35:32.950 --> 02:35:34.070]
This is a...

[02:35:34.070 --> 02:35:34.430]
Thank you.

[02:35:34.490 --> 02:35:37.410]
Radio Hamas, the late and great John McEw.

[02:35:38.150 --> 02:35:39.110]
John McEw?

[02:35:39.350 --> 02:35:39.970]
Your number, John?

[02:35:40.270 --> 02:35:40.650]
Oh, yeah.

[02:35:41.430 --> 02:35:42.630]
Wherever happened to John?

[02:35:42.990 --> 02:35:44.850]
Well, we're hoping not to find out.

[02:35:46.710 --> 02:35:50.990]
Well, I remember he used to broadcast over WCII.

[02:35:51.550 --> 02:35:51.850]
Mm-hmm.

[02:35:51.850 --> 02:35:53.150]
Yeah, he's been in all the big stations.

[02:35:53.150 --> 02:35:54.990]
You know, Port Charlotte and Fort Myers.

[02:35:55.590 --> 02:35:56.930]
Yeah, this is...

[02:35:56.930 --> 02:35:57.990]
And he butchered.

[02:35:57.990 --> 02:36:00.590]
He butchered this station up on a weekend for many, many months.

[02:36:00.590 --> 02:36:02.670]
In fact, just the other night, it's funny you should mention his name.

[02:36:02.670 --> 02:36:05.490]
I was wondering how it is that would they ever left him on the air here that long.

[02:36:06.730 --> 02:36:10.670]
Yeah, I was glad we got it when I was listening to you on Sunday.

[02:36:12.450 --> 02:36:14.870]
And said that John McEw would be coming on in the evening.

[02:36:15.830 --> 02:36:16.150]
Yeah.

[02:36:17.590 --> 02:36:19.130]
And he was so good over here.

[02:36:19.230 --> 02:36:19.970]
Oh, he was great.

[02:36:20.370 --> 02:36:20.990]
My favorite.

[02:36:20.990 --> 02:36:21.650]
Out of business.

[02:36:22.510 --> 02:36:22.870]
Yeah.

[02:36:23.030 --> 02:36:23.770]
I was down.

[02:36:24.170 --> 02:36:26.050]
He was real good at Radio Shack too, man.

[02:36:26.130 --> 02:36:28.410]
Nobody could sell a battery like, like, good John.

[02:36:28.850 --> 02:36:29.330]
He was great.

[02:36:30.210 --> 02:36:32.870]
Well, I thought you might, my deal would tell me where he was now.

[02:36:33.050 --> 02:36:34.310]
Well, we'll try to find out for you.

[02:36:34.410 --> 02:36:38.450]
I bet you one of our, I bet one of our radio spies will call in before two o'clock and let you know.

[02:36:38.710 --> 02:36:39.750]
Oh, before I let you go.

[02:36:40.430 --> 02:36:43.390]
Uh, did you know the Wolfman Jack is in Southwest Florida.

[02:36:43.710 --> 02:36:44.230]
Is, uh, weekend?

[02:36:44.550 --> 02:36:45.290]
Well, that's exciting.

[02:36:46.030 --> 02:36:48.990]
We're doing a, uh, remote from one of the auto dealerships.

[02:36:49.110 --> 02:36:50.250]
Yeah, and maple.

[02:36:51.370 --> 02:36:51.730]
What?

[02:36:53.150 --> 02:36:53.650]
That's right.

[02:36:54.470 --> 02:36:56.730]
He, uh, will take, he's like Willard Scott, man.

[02:36:56.810 --> 02:36:58.750]
He will go anywhere and take anybody's money.

[02:36:59.150 --> 02:37:00.490]
What he's doing, he's going to do it.

[02:37:00.810 --> 02:37:04.990]
He's going to do a new radio show in L.A.

[02:37:05.610 --> 02:37:07.970]
Uh, he said the transmitters located in Mexico.

[02:37:08.370 --> 02:37:08.530]
Yeah.

[02:37:08.930 --> 02:37:10.090]
Well, that's a good place for him.

[02:37:10.210 --> 02:37:10.870]
And he's going to do it.

[02:37:10.890 --> 02:37:11.330]
He'll wanna.

[02:37:11.950 --> 02:37:12.870]
I do it from home.

[02:37:12.950 --> 02:37:15.930]
He says, all you have to do is get out of bed and spend his records.

[02:37:16.330 --> 02:37:16.870]
Okay, sir.

[02:37:16.870 --> 02:37:17.970]
Well, listen, have a wonderful life.

[02:37:17.970 --> 02:37:21.290]
And we hope we find John McQ for you because if anybody deserves him,

[02:37:21.850 --> 02:37:22.470]
Broward, hello.

[02:37:23.050 --> 02:37:24.230]
Yeah, I wonder if it's up to Glenn.

[02:37:25.090 --> 02:37:25.750]
Go ahead.

[02:37:27.230 --> 02:37:28.370]
Turn your radio down.

[02:37:28.450 --> 02:37:28.890]
Okay, Glenn.

[02:37:29.170 --> 02:37:29.510]
Yes, sir.

[02:37:29.710 --> 02:37:30.570]
Yeah, hi, how you doing?

[02:37:30.790 --> 02:37:31.030]
Fine.

[02:37:31.330 --> 02:37:32.590]
Okay, I just wanted to thank you.

[02:37:32.650 --> 02:37:34.970]
I got the tape in the mail today and it's fantastic.

[02:37:35.530 --> 02:37:35.750]
Good.

[02:37:36.250 --> 02:37:37.630]
Yeah, you guys are doing a hell of a job.

[02:37:38.050 --> 02:37:38.950]
You can say that again.

[02:37:39.210 --> 02:37:41.130]
David, you didn't do a send-to picture of all of you.

[02:37:41.870 --> 02:37:43.450]
Uh, sir, trust me.

[02:37:44.170 --> 02:37:44.890]
Trust me.

[02:37:44.890 --> 02:37:46.770]
Stick with your fantasy, okay?

[02:37:47.550 --> 02:37:48.930]
I did your favor, man.

[02:37:49.090 --> 02:37:49.490]
Is that what?

[02:37:49.670 --> 02:37:50.450]
Yeah, I'm saying.

[02:37:51.490 --> 02:37:54.490]
Well, it was great to have Neal back and you guys are doing one heck of a job

[02:37:54.490 --> 02:37:55.610]
and the hell with everybody else.

[02:37:55.750 --> 02:37:56.450]
Okay, thank you.

[02:37:56.530 --> 02:37:56.970]
I'll tell you.

[02:37:57.370 --> 02:37:58.390]
I'll tell Neal myself.

[02:37:58.770 --> 02:37:59.270]
Thank you.

[02:37:59.370 --> 02:38:00.430]
Yeah, what a great call.

[02:38:02.270 --> 02:38:02.630]
Why?

[02:38:02.710 --> 02:38:03.650]
Because he tinkled all over you.

[02:38:03.650 --> 02:38:06.170]
Is that the criterion for what makes it great call?

[02:38:06.230 --> 02:38:06.770]
Just kidding.

[02:38:06.970 --> 02:38:10.850]
Is if they call in and they tinkled all over you and thank you so much for the tape

[02:38:10.850 --> 02:38:13.810]
and you're a great American and you never ate a worm.

[02:38:13.810 --> 02:38:15.330]
You know, that you didn't like it all.

[02:38:15.330 --> 02:38:17.010]
I said, what the hell is that?

[02:38:17.550 --> 02:38:18.910]
What kind of a call is that?

[02:38:19.030 --> 02:38:21.770]
It's better than those misfits, you know, ripping me.

[02:38:21.810 --> 02:38:22.070]
Wrong.

[02:38:22.330 --> 02:38:22.810]
If I have a choice.

[02:38:22.810 --> 02:38:25.070]
That's what makes the whole show is the misfits ripping you.

[02:38:25.130 --> 02:38:25.450]
All right.

[02:38:25.550 --> 02:38:27.250]
You know who said that they're misfits?

[02:38:27.730 --> 02:38:28.090]
Me.

[02:38:28.750 --> 02:38:29.110]
Yeah.

[02:38:29.910 --> 02:38:32.810]
Just because they have good taste in their perspacaceous.

[02:38:33.550 --> 02:38:34.570]
Glenn is a big superstar.

[02:38:34.890 --> 02:38:35.910]
I don't know why he's so insecure.

[02:38:35.910 --> 02:38:36.130]
Yeah.

[02:38:36.130 --> 02:38:39.530]
All of a sudden, after last week, he became a superstar in his own mind.

[02:38:42.010 --> 02:38:45.790]
By the way, the guy at the restaurant last night was yanking our chain.

[02:38:46.330 --> 02:38:46.970]
They're not on the air.

[02:38:47.130 --> 02:38:48.990]
Cafe Desionève is not on the air.

[02:38:50.090 --> 02:38:52.310]
I even asked Terry, did you tell that story?

[02:38:52.610 --> 02:38:52.810]
No.

[02:38:53.350 --> 02:38:54.770]
I think it's a fantastic story.

[02:38:54.890 --> 02:38:55.970]
Can I tell you an incredible story?

[02:38:55.990 --> 02:38:57.290]
Go ahead and I'll eat Nutella Sturgeon.

[02:38:57.430 --> 02:38:59.650]
Neil and I are eating there at this restaurant.

[02:39:00.050 --> 02:39:01.730]
Cafe Desionève on Andrews Avenue.

[02:39:02.390 --> 02:39:04.290]
Everything that we want, they don't have.

[02:39:04.490 --> 02:39:07.770]
They've run out to the long, long-labority holiday last night.

[02:39:07.770 --> 02:39:10.050]
I was singing my wife, Loughtown, with a banana.

[02:39:10.210 --> 02:39:11.170]
No bananas forced.

[02:39:11.370 --> 02:39:12.050]
They had no bananas.

[02:39:12.310 --> 02:39:13.990]
We were looking forward to bananas foster.

[02:39:14.230 --> 02:39:15.750]
You know, the guy comes over and he says,

[02:39:15.750 --> 02:39:16.910]
gee, you're not going to believe this.

[02:39:17.010 --> 02:39:17.670]
We're out of bananas.

[02:39:18.350 --> 02:39:21.970]
And then we looked at him and you know, how can you be out of bananas?

[02:39:22.350 --> 02:39:24.770]
I mean, you have to send somebody down the street to the Windex.

[02:39:24.950 --> 02:39:25.890]
See, I can pick up some bananas.

[02:39:26.250 --> 02:39:29.050]
Isn't that a dessert they named after George Foster?

[02:39:30.710 --> 02:39:31.750]
Of the Reds?

[02:39:31.990 --> 02:39:32.710]
I don't know.

[02:39:33.610 --> 02:39:34.470]
Great looking guy.

[02:39:34.850 --> 02:39:35.550]
George, who?

[02:39:36.370 --> 02:39:38.890]
Anyway, so this guy looks like he's got to look.

[02:39:39.130 --> 02:39:39.790]
What am I going to say about George Foster?

[02:39:40.170 --> 02:39:41.210]
No, that's what I...

[02:39:41.210 --> 02:39:42.730]
He doesn't even know who he'll be on Murphy's.

[02:39:43.250 --> 02:39:48.750]
This waiter says he's looking at us and evidently has to give somebody...

[02:39:48.750 --> 02:39:48.990]
Oh, he's a guy.

[02:39:49.530 --> 02:39:51.550]
...old guy and they're running out of food.

[02:39:51.750 --> 02:39:52.830]
They didn't know that she's souped.

[02:39:53.030 --> 02:39:54.770]
They had to make up new soup and that kind of thing.

[02:39:55.450 --> 02:39:57.530]
And he says, I don't know the reason for it.

[02:39:57.590 --> 02:40:01.430]
We had a lot of people in here, you know, this long holiday weekend.

[02:40:02.010 --> 02:40:05.530]
He said, I think it's because we had some commercials running on Neil Rogers' program.

[02:40:05.530 --> 02:40:06.710]
I'm on W-I-N-Z.

[02:40:08.130 --> 02:40:10.230]
And I'm looking at Neil and Neil's looking at me.

[02:40:11.190 --> 02:40:14.030]
And we didn't say anything and then the guy left.

[02:40:14.390 --> 02:40:15.770]
And we both fell over in the booth.

[02:40:16.370 --> 02:40:18.270]
And I said, I never heard them on the air.

[02:40:20.290 --> 02:40:22.650]
And then he started thinking about it.

[02:40:23.010 --> 02:40:24.410]
And he thought that maybe...

[02:40:24.410 --> 02:40:25.730]
Yeah, he had me convinced that maybe I had cut it.

[02:40:26.550 --> 02:40:29.130]
I know that the Lord even loves Neil Rogers.

[02:40:30.390 --> 02:40:31.770]
So it's incredible.

[02:40:31.990 --> 02:40:33.810]
Our sales department's got a great tool here.

[02:40:33.810 --> 02:40:36.110]
Even if you're not on the Neil Rogers show.

[02:40:36.650 --> 02:40:37.770]
Even if you have not bought it.

[02:40:37.770 --> 02:40:38.230]
It's a giant blame.

[02:40:38.470 --> 02:40:39.570]
That was out of town for 10 days.

[02:40:39.610 --> 02:40:42.270]
I get blamed for the fact that they run out of everything that we wanted.

[02:40:42.990 --> 02:40:44.510]
It's the Rogers fault, see?

[02:40:45.090 --> 02:40:46.330]
I got blamed for everything.

[02:40:46.330 --> 02:40:48.310]
So this guy knew who I was.

[02:40:48.730 --> 02:40:50.890]
And he didn't... this was his way of being clever.

[02:40:51.250 --> 02:40:52.450]
That's why I'm glad you're back.

[02:40:52.630 --> 02:40:55.430]
Wouldn't it have been a lot more clever if he would have just said no check?

[02:40:56.230 --> 02:40:57.130]
Now, I don't like that.

[02:40:57.610 --> 02:40:58.150]
As you know.

[02:40:59.210 --> 02:40:59.410]
I would.

[02:40:59.550 --> 02:41:00.170]
Wouldn't that have been clear?

[02:41:00.170 --> 02:41:00.910]
Yeah, you like it.

[02:41:00.970 --> 02:41:02.050]
You're always going to go out with it.

[02:41:02.050 --> 02:41:02.850]
You're a free loader.

[02:41:02.850 --> 02:41:03.930]
He's always looking for a freebie.

[02:41:03.990 --> 02:41:05.010]
Boy, I think we're going to get a check.

[02:41:05.230 --> 02:41:06.070]
I think we're going to get a check.

[02:41:07.050 --> 02:41:07.430]
Panic.

[02:41:07.870 --> 02:41:09.070]
Panic, stride, said sin.

[02:41:10.390 --> 02:41:13.630]
The worst free loader next to Jerry, you know who?

[02:41:13.630 --> 02:41:14.390]
Oh, you know in Boston.

[02:41:14.850 --> 02:41:15.170]
Uh-oh.

[02:41:15.290 --> 02:41:16.510]
Guy down the street.

[02:41:17.910 --> 02:41:18.590]
Oh, yeah.

[02:41:18.730 --> 02:41:18.810]
Oh, yeah.

[02:41:19.050 --> 02:41:19.310]
Yeah.

[02:41:19.490 --> 02:41:19.590]
Oh, yeah.

[02:41:19.590 --> 02:41:20.970]
Mr. Excuses.

[02:41:21.070 --> 02:41:21.390]
You bet.

[02:41:22.010 --> 02:41:26.330]
Not only does he want to eat free in his restaurants, he wants to be able to give his cards out

[02:41:26.330 --> 02:41:27.330]
to everybody in town.

[02:41:27.630 --> 02:41:30.730]
And when they come in and mention his name, they're supposed to get a freebie.

[02:41:30.730 --> 02:41:32.790]
Oh, that's great.

[02:41:33.090 --> 02:41:35.050]
Of course he doesn't have any friends, so it doesn't make any difference.

[02:41:36.190 --> 02:41:36.910]
Uh-uh.

[02:41:37.190 --> 02:41:37.830]
Broward, hello.

[02:41:39.610 --> 02:41:39.970]
Broward.

[02:41:40.350 --> 02:41:40.710]
Broward.

[02:41:40.770 --> 02:41:40.770]

[02:41:41.050 --> 02:41:41.410]
Broward.

[02:41:41.670 --> 02:41:43.030]
That must be a food check again.

[02:41:43.690 --> 02:41:43.970]
No.

[02:41:44.550 --> 02:41:45.090]
He's in dead.

[02:41:46.010 --> 02:41:47.130]
Let's put that one on hold.

[02:41:48.250 --> 02:41:49.250]
Dave County, hello.

[02:41:49.590 --> 02:41:50.550]
Yeah, can I speak to Neil, please?

[02:41:50.890 --> 02:41:51.410]
Yeah, speaking.

[02:41:51.890 --> 02:41:52.190]
Neil.

[02:41:52.530 --> 02:41:52.790]
Yeah.

[02:41:53.110 --> 02:41:53.870]
Better to hit your back.

[02:41:54.290 --> 02:41:54.530]
Yeah.

[02:41:54.790 --> 02:41:55.110]
What's up?

[02:41:55.350 --> 02:41:56.610]
I got one question for you.

[02:41:57.310 --> 02:41:59.990]
I want to give, you know, I want to send my tape in for the songs and everything.

[02:41:59.990 --> 02:42:00.490]
Yeah.

[02:42:00.510 --> 02:42:01.570]
I don't want to send it through to me.

[02:42:01.690 --> 02:42:02.610]
I want to bring it in.

[02:42:03.210 --> 02:42:03.530]
Why?

[02:42:03.710 --> 02:42:04.790]
Would there be any problem with that?

[02:42:04.890 --> 02:42:05.150]
Why?

[02:42:05.430 --> 02:42:06.310]
I don't send things through me.

[02:42:06.310 --> 02:42:07.230]
I don't like mailing anything.

[02:42:07.310 --> 02:42:08.250]
Why do you want to bring it in?

[02:42:08.490 --> 02:42:08.630]
Huh?

[02:42:09.050 --> 02:42:10.210]
What do you want to bring it in for?

[02:42:10.410 --> 02:42:10.790]
Why not?

[02:42:12.550 --> 02:42:13.730]
I'm going to bring more than that in.

[02:42:15.310 --> 02:42:15.630]
Really?

[02:42:17.110 --> 02:42:18.530]
Is that a thread or a promise?

[02:42:19.890 --> 02:42:21.930]
Yeah, you see the direction this call is going.

[02:42:22.210 --> 02:42:22.210]

[02:42:22.230 --> 02:42:24.130]
I see the direction this call is going in right now.

[02:42:25.110 --> 02:42:28.950]
Sir, anybody that talks like that, you know, obviously it's wishful thinking.

[02:42:28.950 --> 02:42:30.030]
Well, why not?

[02:42:30.830 --> 02:42:33.570]
See, he thinks he's going to get to come back and be on the show.

[02:42:33.890 --> 02:42:35.250]
No, we're not going to see that anymore.

[02:42:35.550 --> 02:42:36.250]
Aren't you wishful?

[02:42:36.610 --> 02:42:41.010]
Do you notice that none of the people that we had on the show have, we've never heard from them again.

[02:42:43.150 --> 02:42:43.950]
Carlos, Adam.

[02:42:45.470 --> 02:42:46.490]
What was the girl's name?

[02:42:46.970 --> 02:42:46.970]

[02:42:47.150 --> 02:42:47.350]
Linda.

[02:42:47.690 --> 02:42:48.230]
That's the parents.

[02:42:49.430 --> 02:42:49.690]
Where?

[02:42:50.050 --> 02:42:51.010]
Parents are among them.

[02:42:52.410 --> 02:42:53.190]
Well, what?

[02:42:53.750 --> 02:42:55.670]
All three of your crack ups.

[02:42:56.150 --> 02:42:59.790]
You can bring it in, drop it.

[02:42:59.810 --> 02:43:00.550]
Are you speaking English, sir?

[02:43:00.650 --> 02:43:01.870]
What language are you speaking in?

[02:43:02.430 --> 02:43:03.330]
I'm speaking my language.

[02:43:03.490 --> 02:43:03.590]
Why?

[02:43:03.790 --> 02:43:05.410]
What language are you speaking?

[02:43:05.730 --> 02:43:06.510]
Okay, hold on a minute.

[02:43:06.790 --> 02:43:07.830]
Where do you buy your toys, sir?

[02:43:10.190 --> 02:43:10.530]
Hello?

[02:43:12.090 --> 02:43:12.630]
They left.

[02:43:12.830 --> 02:43:13.610]
They hung up.

[02:43:14.630 --> 02:43:15.450]
Okay, go ahead, sir.

[02:43:15.550 --> 02:43:16.070]
What the hell do you want?

[02:43:17.690 --> 02:43:21.750]
I said, I wouldn't like to bring my tape in to get a copy of a couple of songs.

[02:43:22.010 --> 02:43:23.450]
Yeah, that's why I thought you said.

[02:43:24.390 --> 02:43:24.690]
Pardon?

[02:43:24.690 --> 02:43:26.270]
That's what I thought you said.

[02:43:26.330 --> 02:43:26.710]
Yeah.

[02:43:27.070 --> 02:43:28.930]
And you know what the answer is?

[02:43:29.430 --> 02:43:30.110]
But I know.

[02:43:30.110 --> 02:43:30.190]
But I know.

[02:43:30.290 --> 02:43:31.930]
Send it in the mail like everybody else.

[02:43:32.090 --> 02:43:32.930]
Oh, come on.

[02:43:32.970 --> 02:43:33.630]
I've got to be different.

[02:43:33.890 --> 02:43:34.750]
No way, Jose.

[02:43:35.010 --> 02:43:35.850]
I'm not a clone.

[02:43:36.350 --> 02:43:36.870]
I'm an original.

[02:43:38.330 --> 02:43:39.550]
Oh, you got a big mustache?

[02:43:39.970 --> 02:43:41.430]
Yes, I do.

[02:43:41.610 --> 02:43:43.310]
What is that guy that does the sports drawings?

[02:43:43.650 --> 02:43:44.790]
He draws, oh yeah.

[02:43:45.170 --> 02:43:47.550]
Got that big, ridiculous mustache.

[02:43:48.030 --> 02:43:49.370]
I saw him on a spot.

[02:43:49.530 --> 02:43:50.590]
He's always drawing.

[02:43:50.810 --> 02:43:54.670]
He's always doing these drawings of young, like jockeys, of young, like kids.

[02:43:54.670 --> 02:43:57.410]
Cash-ass mucin, you know, they're bad drawings, too.

[02:43:57.510 --> 02:43:57.710]
Yeah.

[02:43:58.050 --> 02:43:59.230]
I speak up on the grows.

[02:43:59.710 --> 02:44:00.950]
Good. That's why we like it.

[02:44:01.010 --> 02:44:03.750]
We like to distort our voices, so you're not sure who it is.

[02:44:03.870 --> 02:44:04.730]
It's going to be gone, too.

[02:44:04.730 --> 02:44:05.030]
I'm going to talk to him again.

[02:44:05.150 --> 02:44:05.550]
I like that.

[02:44:05.790 --> 02:44:05.970]
Yeah.

[02:44:06.330 --> 02:44:07.350]
Okay, well, good luck to you, sir.

[02:44:07.930 --> 02:44:08.270]
Okay.

[02:44:08.530 --> 02:44:09.210]
Have a great life.

[02:44:09.490 --> 02:44:09.610]
You too.

[02:44:09.850 --> 02:44:10.110]
Okay.

[02:44:10.410 --> 02:44:15.070]
Engineering department is threatening to make it so that we can't do what you're doing right now.

[02:44:15.150 --> 02:44:15.570]
Why is that?

[02:44:15.690 --> 02:44:17.050]
They don't like the little clicks and pumps.

[02:44:17.310 --> 02:44:17.670]
You know what?

[02:44:17.750 --> 02:44:19.010]
I don't give a damn what they like.

[02:44:19.150 --> 02:44:21.750]
We're not doing the show for the engineering department, okay?

[02:44:22.090 --> 02:44:22.230]
Really?

[02:44:22.230 --> 02:44:23.650]
I'll punch up 71 on there.

[02:44:23.730 --> 02:44:24.230]
Will you please?

[02:44:24.330 --> 02:44:24.750]
Hahaha.

[02:44:27.950 --> 02:44:28.410]
Unbelievable.

[02:44:28.830 --> 02:44:29.290]
Do you believe that?

[02:44:30.710 --> 02:44:31.470]
Yeah, you are.

[02:44:31.630 --> 02:44:32.470]
Let me do it again.

[02:44:32.710 --> 02:44:33.130]
Let me do it again.

[02:44:33.150 --> 02:44:33.610]
It was ringing.

[02:44:33.830 --> 02:44:37.310]
Why are you messing with everything you touch?

[02:44:41.090 --> 02:44:41.870]
Still ringing.

[02:44:42.170 --> 02:44:42.690]
How'd we do it?

[02:44:43.130 --> 02:44:44.970]
Attention engineering department.

[02:44:45.630 --> 02:44:46.290]
Bug off.

[02:44:46.910 --> 02:44:47.370]
Hahaha.

[02:44:49.790 --> 02:44:51.390]
They don't like the clicks and pumps.

[02:44:51.390 --> 02:44:52.310]
That's the whole idea.

[02:44:52.510 --> 02:44:53.450]
That's what makes it fun.

[02:44:54.090 --> 02:44:54.090]

[02:44:55.230 --> 02:44:55.670]
Hahaha.

[02:44:56.310 --> 02:45:00.510]
I mean, anybody can put them on hold and, you know, do this pseudo-phoney stuff.

[02:45:01.510 --> 02:45:03.030]
Like Sandy and Jared.

[02:45:03.590 --> 02:45:04.030]
Hahaha.

[02:45:05.110 --> 02:45:06.010]
I know Jared, real well.

[02:45:06.450 --> 02:45:07.770]
In fact, two o'clock.

[02:45:08.150 --> 02:45:08.630]
Hello, Jay.

[02:45:09.350 --> 02:45:10.490]
Yeah, me and me again.

[02:45:11.210 --> 02:45:12.330]
What do you mean you again?

[02:45:12.710 --> 02:45:13.030]
Hahaha.

[02:45:13.170 --> 02:45:14.470]
How come I didn't get him disconnected?

[02:45:15.250 --> 02:45:15.970]
Broward, hello.

[02:45:15.970 --> 02:45:16.050]
Hello.

[02:45:18.370 --> 02:45:18.730]
Hello.

[02:45:21.150 --> 02:45:21.510]
Hahaha.

[02:45:22.690 --> 02:45:22.890]
Yeah.

[02:45:23.910 --> 02:45:24.550]
Yes, sir.

[02:45:24.610 --> 02:45:25.570]
When you got to go, you got to go.

[02:45:25.590 --> 02:45:27.230]
Will you get out of that tunnel that you're in?

[02:45:28.030 --> 02:45:29.430]
Speak into the phone, sir.

[02:45:30.050 --> 02:45:31.470]
Are you taking me to meet you, sir?

[02:45:31.910 --> 02:45:32.110]
Yeah.

[02:45:34.850 --> 02:45:36.030]
2713 Michigan State.

[02:45:37.110 --> 02:45:39.010]
You want to hear the Michigan State fight song?

[02:45:39.090 --> 02:45:40.070]
Oh, don't.

[02:45:40.230 --> 02:45:40.590]
No.

[02:45:41.310 --> 02:45:42.010]
Let's hear it.

[02:45:42.090 --> 02:45:43.030]
Are you from...

[02:45:43.030 --> 02:45:43.970]
Did you go to Michigan State?

[02:45:44.350 --> 02:45:45.050]
No, sir.

[02:45:45.170 --> 02:45:45.850]
I went to Michigan.

[02:45:46.130 --> 02:45:47.030]
You went to Michigan?

[02:45:47.950 --> 02:45:49.290]
Boy, I put it in the...

[02:45:49.290 --> 02:45:50.770]
Another Michigan or I went...

[02:45:50.770 --> 02:45:51.190]
Oh, boy.

[02:45:51.430 --> 02:45:55.790]
Let me tell you, I went to the real U.M. University of...

[02:45:55.790 --> 02:45:56.470]
Me, I'm a...

[02:45:56.470 --> 02:45:57.570]
University of Mung.

[02:45:58.410 --> 02:45:58.970]
Oh, no, no.

[02:45:59.110 --> 02:46:00.730]
Hey, we be up on Florida.

[02:46:01.870 --> 02:46:03.710]
So, what do you want in the ward?

[02:46:04.370 --> 02:46:04.750]
Absolutely.

[02:46:05.030 --> 02:46:08.110]
And they won't play us again for 1992, but you'll win.

[02:46:08.550 --> 02:46:08.990]
Uh-huh.

[02:46:09.470 --> 02:46:11.050]
We'll get in there, getting their conference.

[02:46:11.250 --> 02:46:12.870]
I'll play you every couple of times a year.

[02:46:12.870 --> 02:46:13.290]
Oh, yeah.

[02:46:13.390 --> 02:46:14.310]
They dropped us to play.

[02:46:14.570 --> 02:46:15.010]
Toast...

[02:46:15.010 --> 02:46:17.010]
Toast is Montana State.

[02:46:17.750 --> 02:46:18.430]
Real power.

[02:46:19.630 --> 02:46:22.490]
What do you think about the dolphins this year, um...

[02:46:22.490 --> 02:46:23.130]
Sir...

[02:46:23.130 --> 02:46:23.730]
Forget it.

[02:46:24.230 --> 02:46:25.730]
No dolphins are going to be all right.

[02:46:26.310 --> 02:46:26.810]
Forget it.

[02:46:26.850 --> 02:46:27.990]
As long as Choworsky is for...

[02:46:27.990 --> 02:46:29.330]
They could play Buffalo every week.

[02:46:29.410 --> 02:46:30.230]
They'd be in great shape.

[02:46:30.370 --> 02:46:30.970]
Head and six.

[02:46:31.170 --> 02:46:31.830]
Playout team.

[02:46:32.650 --> 02:46:32.910]
Yeah.

[02:46:33.470 --> 02:46:34.830]
Try eight and, uh...

[02:46:34.830 --> 02:46:34.970]
Yeah.

[02:46:35.310 --> 02:46:35.750]
Eight and eight.

[02:46:35.930 --> 02:46:39.170]
I had a very interesting conversation to a Hank Goldberg about you.

[02:46:39.510 --> 02:46:39.790]
Really?

[02:46:40.450 --> 02:46:40.890]
Yes.

[02:46:41.750 --> 02:46:44.610]
I asked them if you and if you two are the same.

[02:46:45.670 --> 02:46:46.890]
You weren't denying it.

[02:46:47.870 --> 02:46:49.610]
So, that leads us up to speculation.

[02:46:51.210 --> 02:46:54.390]
Okay, what do you think about, uh, more in Nathan being dropped?

[02:46:54.710 --> 02:46:56.150]
I was really surprised at that.

[02:46:56.230 --> 02:46:57.190]
Yeah, it's going to...

[02:46:57.190 --> 02:46:58.050]
They went, did take that.

[02:46:58.110 --> 02:46:58.890]
I'd like to shake their hands.

[02:46:59.870 --> 02:47:03.250]
I mean, I'm a little surprised that the linebacker situation

[02:47:03.250 --> 02:47:05.150]
only kept four linebackers.

[02:47:05.530 --> 02:47:07.910]
You think they're keeping, keeping Chowors for a trading vac?

[02:47:08.210 --> 02:47:09.010]
I would think so.

[02:47:09.010 --> 02:47:11.890]
They need some help at linebackers.

[02:47:11.990 --> 02:47:14.010]
Listen, a lot of quarterbacks got cut yesterday.

[02:47:14.330 --> 02:47:16.130]
Yeah, they got Choworsky, you know.

[02:47:16.130 --> 02:47:16.290]
Yeah.

[02:47:16.670 --> 02:47:17.070]
My...

[02:47:17.070 --> 02:47:17.350]
Yeah.

[02:47:17.810 --> 02:47:18.890]
Who must be upset?

[02:47:19.450 --> 02:47:20.550]
Okay, well, I shouldn't...

[02:47:20.550 --> 02:47:21.570]
Enough of this sports talk.

[02:47:22.710 --> 02:47:22.850]
Yeah.

[02:47:27.530 --> 02:47:29.210]
Let's hear it for the Spartans.

[02:47:30.410 --> 02:47:32.650]
Mom, did you see their coach by the way?

[02:47:32.930 --> 02:47:33.630]
With the beer belly?

[02:47:34.230 --> 02:47:35.270]
That's MSU, man.

[02:47:35.310 --> 02:47:36.110]
That's what it's all about.

[02:47:40.930 --> 02:47:44.290]
All the whole team sits out there in the Gables and drinks six packs.

[02:47:47.630 --> 02:47:50.530]
Drinks Mysterbrow by the half gallon for hours.

[02:47:53.570 --> 02:47:56.410]
If I had to do the Hurricanes' Clan, he'd be 10 teams.

[02:47:56.890 --> 02:47:57.030]
Never?

[02:47:58.830 --> 02:48:00.910]
Yeah, they play some toughing like Wisconsin.

[02:48:02.970 --> 02:48:03.490]
Northwestern.

[02:48:04.070 --> 02:48:04.590]
Northwestern.

[02:48:05.530 --> 02:48:06.050]
Fordo.

[02:48:06.590 --> 02:48:06.590]

[02:48:06.790 --> 02:48:07.130]
Whoop.

[02:48:11.590 --> 02:48:12.890]
Can't believe you're doing this.

[02:48:13.030 --> 02:48:19.350]
And occasionally, when they really get bold, they take on the fighting Spartans of East Lansing.

[02:48:20.730 --> 02:48:22.790]
The temperature never panses 50.

[02:48:26.110 --> 02:48:27.430]
Only when you're on the head.

[02:48:27.490 --> 02:48:29.850]
And the Red Cedar River is made of rubber.

[02:48:31.030 --> 02:48:33.670]
I think the high is the highest in the destroyer's 82.

[02:48:33.670 --> 02:48:34.590]
Listen now.

[02:48:36.150 --> 02:48:37.410]
Or we get to do it?

[02:48:38.070 --> 02:48:39.350]
We've closed the grid off.

[02:48:39.590 --> 02:48:40.050]
We're in it.

[02:48:47.290 --> 02:48:49.250]
Lockheed, but nothing good for a particular reason.

[02:48:50.110 --> 02:48:51.490]
Not like the Gazi city, baby.

[02:48:51.590 --> 02:48:53.030]
Hey, they're all stoned out of their mind.

[02:48:53.130 --> 02:48:53.550]
Leave them alone.

[02:49:02.490 --> 02:49:04.430]
They can't walk in place until they fight.

[02:49:09.610 --> 02:49:11.410]
My favorite part is...

[02:49:11.410 --> 02:49:11.490]
Oh!

[02:49:14.690 --> 02:49:15.450]
There it is.

[02:49:28.090 --> 02:49:28.710]
...

[02:49:38.450 --> 02:49:40.290]
143 at Winds will come back.

[02:49:53.690 --> 02:49:56.470]
I know that the Zord even loves Neil Rogers.

[02:49:56.730 --> 02:50:00.310]
14.002 and the stand will be along with Mark Mosley at 2 o'clock.

[02:50:00.390 --> 02:50:01.190]
Why can't we wait for that?

[02:50:02.150 --> 02:50:02.770]
Mark's funny.

[02:50:02.930 --> 02:50:03.610]
Can you wait for that?

[02:50:05.510 --> 02:50:06.250]
Dave County.

[02:50:06.370 --> 02:50:06.550]
Hello.

[02:50:06.910 --> 02:50:07.430]
Hi, Neil.

[02:50:07.430 --> 02:50:07.890]
Hi.

[02:50:08.390 --> 02:50:11.950]
I just wanted to tell you something that I saw over the weekend in front of a pantry

[02:50:11.950 --> 02:50:13.550]
pride in Scalic Mall.

[02:50:14.050 --> 02:50:19.370]
The herald had somebody hawking t-shirts with a free t-shirt with this description.

[02:50:20.030 --> 02:50:20.510]
Would what?

[02:50:20.810 --> 02:50:24.250]
If you'd quit moving things around, we could hear what the lady is saying.

[02:50:25.210 --> 02:50:27.550]
He's a shuffling pizza around on the table.

[02:50:28.270 --> 02:50:28.950]
Go ahead, I'm sorry.

[02:50:29.250 --> 02:50:31.190]
I just thought it was funny, but I thought it looked pretty pathetic.

[02:50:31.590 --> 02:50:35.650]
I saw it out there trying to sell subscriptions by giving you a free t-shirt.

[02:50:37.170 --> 02:50:38.170]
You mean to the herald?

[02:50:38.350 --> 02:50:38.610]
Uh-huh.

[02:50:38.910 --> 02:50:39.750]
Boy, that's desperate.

[02:50:39.970 --> 02:50:41.050]
And the people were just walking by.

[02:50:41.170 --> 02:50:43.490]
Nobody would even, he looked like a bum for one thing.

[02:50:43.790 --> 02:50:43.890]
Yeah.

[02:50:44.330 --> 02:50:45.250]
It was, I thought.

[02:50:45.350 --> 02:50:46.810]
Well, you don't know that's Dick Kepin now.

[02:50:46.850 --> 02:50:48.170]
He's out there hawking his own paper.

[02:50:48.290 --> 02:50:48.730]
Oh, terrific.

[02:50:48.970 --> 02:50:49.190]
Yeah.

[02:50:49.330 --> 02:50:51.570]
Well, I just went to let you know that I thought it was pretty funny.

[02:50:51.930 --> 02:50:52.170]
Okay.

[02:50:52.470 --> 02:50:52.710]
All right.

[02:50:52.930 --> 02:50:53.290]
Thank you.

[02:50:53.410 --> 02:50:54.930]
I wonder if it was a Pope tour t-shirt.

[02:50:55.630 --> 02:50:56.270]
You've seen those?

[02:50:56.350 --> 02:50:59.710]
What if the herald is going to pick on the Pope this time like the last time he was

[02:50:59.710 --> 02:50:59.890]
here?

[02:51:00.330 --> 02:51:03.730]
And I don't know why everybody keeps telling me I keep referring to the fact that the

[02:51:03.730 --> 02:51:06.650]
last time the Pope came here, the church tried to give me off the ear.

[02:51:07.410 --> 02:51:09.250]
And they say, oh, that was the previous Pope.

[02:51:09.450 --> 02:51:10.430]
It wasn't the previous Pope.

[02:51:10.570 --> 02:51:11.310]
It was this Pope.

[02:51:11.950 --> 02:51:13.910]
It was this Neanderthal, it was him.

[02:51:13.950 --> 02:51:14.890]
He was here in 79.

[02:51:15.430 --> 02:51:17.610]
See how time flies while you're making little babies?

[02:51:17.930 --> 02:51:18.730]
It's incredible.

[02:51:20.030 --> 02:51:20.670]
Broward, hello.

[02:51:21.110 --> 02:51:21.710]
Hi, Neil.

[02:51:22.030 --> 02:51:24.590]
And by the way, we like those pops and pukes on a phone.

[02:51:24.590 --> 02:51:26.770]
So just leave our speaker phone alone.

[02:51:26.990 --> 02:51:27.510]
That's it.

[02:51:27.730 --> 02:51:28.350]
Yeah, leave it alone.

[02:51:28.350 --> 02:51:29.010]
Talk, let me talk.

[02:51:29.110 --> 02:51:29.450]
Go ahead.

[02:51:29.650 --> 02:51:31.270]
About the cafe diginees.

[02:51:31.490 --> 02:51:31.670]
Yeah.

[02:51:31.930 --> 02:51:36.650]
Last week on Stan show, after you had Linda Thornton, he wanted to know if the fondue at the

[02:51:36.650 --> 02:51:38.130]
cafe diginees was any good.

[02:51:38.770 --> 02:51:42.230]
And I called, I said I had eaten there and that it was pretty good.

[02:51:42.410 --> 02:51:43.990]
So that may be the reason for that plug.

[02:51:44.630 --> 02:51:44.930]
Really?

[02:51:45.310 --> 02:51:45.510]
Yeah.

[02:51:46.150 --> 02:51:48.950]
So am I entitled to any monetary remuneration?

[02:51:49.530 --> 02:51:49.970]
Oh, sure.

[02:51:50.250 --> 02:51:50.310]
Yeah.

[02:51:51.110 --> 02:51:53.910]
You can pay a reimbursement for our checklist.

[02:51:53.910 --> 02:51:55.170]
That was about 40 bucks.

[02:51:56.030 --> 02:51:56.770]
40, but whoa.

[02:51:56.770 --> 02:51:58.670]
I think you'll have to go to the restaurant for that.

[02:51:59.570 --> 02:52:00.010]
No, no.

[02:52:00.190 --> 02:52:03.030]
In other words, you are the one responsible for us going there.

[02:52:03.230 --> 02:52:05.750]
So if you want to do it fair, you send it.

[02:52:05.750 --> 02:52:08.150]
How responsible for the great business they did over the last week?

[02:52:08.310 --> 02:52:08.810]
Well, I see.

[02:52:08.930 --> 02:52:11.930]
Well, I go over there and tell them that you're a friend of ours and they'll charge you

[02:52:11.930 --> 02:52:12.190]
double.

[02:52:13.090 --> 02:52:13.090]

[02:52:13.090 --> 02:52:14.670]
I mean, guys are real comedian, you know?

[02:52:15.110 --> 02:52:15.330]
Who?

[02:52:15.810 --> 02:52:16.210]
The waiter.

[02:52:16.630 --> 02:52:16.930]
He was?

[02:52:17.390 --> 02:52:18.490]
No, he thought he was.

[02:52:18.950 --> 02:52:20.410]
OK, I'll never plug them again.

[02:52:20.630 --> 02:52:20.830]
OK.

[02:52:20.970 --> 02:52:22.770]
So one of the three of us, by the way, it was OK.

[02:52:23.050 --> 02:52:24.690]
It was, you know, OK.

[02:52:25.410 --> 02:52:25.770]
OK.

[02:52:26.010 --> 02:52:26.230]
OK.

[02:52:26.230 --> 02:52:26.830]
That's sensational.

[02:52:27.890 --> 02:52:28.230]
OK.

[02:52:28.930 --> 02:52:30.750]
Oh, um, John 316.

[02:52:31.110 --> 02:52:31.310]
Yeah.

[02:52:31.790 --> 02:52:32.870]
I had it right here.

[02:52:32.990 --> 02:52:36.150]
It reads, and I know that the Lord even loves Neil Rogers.

[02:52:36.370 --> 02:52:36.670]
Yeah.

[02:52:36.850 --> 02:52:37.330]
That's the one.

[02:52:37.830 --> 02:52:38.890]
I always liked that.

[02:52:39.070 --> 02:52:40.550]
My favorite quote from the Bible.

[02:52:41.570 --> 02:52:41.970]
OK.

[02:52:42.290 --> 02:52:43.270]
Wait, one last thing.

[02:52:43.370 --> 02:52:43.570]
Yeah.

[02:52:44.030 --> 02:52:45.130]
Don't let me stop you now.

[02:52:45.130 --> 02:52:45.730]
You're on a roll.

[02:52:45.870 --> 02:52:49.050]
OK, speaking of Jeff Striker, Power Tool, et cetera.

[02:52:49.290 --> 02:52:50.810]
Yeah, there's a great line in that movie, too.

[02:52:50.910 --> 02:52:51.510]
You know what it is?

[02:52:51.890 --> 02:52:55.590]
I'll put anyone in the world out of their mouth, which, uh, sing what was in it.

[02:52:55.590 --> 02:52:56.370]
That's true.

[02:52:56.410 --> 02:52:56.770]
OK.

[02:52:57.030 --> 02:52:58.350]
Have you ever seen Centurions?

[02:52:58.470 --> 02:53:00.450]
Are you another one of these guys that is into these?

[02:53:00.590 --> 02:53:00.750]
No.

[02:53:01.030 --> 02:53:01.710]
Wait a minute.

[02:53:01.930 --> 02:53:01.990]
No.

[02:53:03.090 --> 02:53:03.490]
Neil.

[02:53:04.050 --> 02:53:04.990]
Is this your show?

[02:53:05.350 --> 02:53:06.650]
Do I have to ask permission to speak?

[02:53:07.290 --> 02:53:07.550]
OK.

[02:53:07.610 --> 02:53:07.950]
Go ahead.

[02:53:08.250 --> 02:53:09.170]
No, I don't want to say it.

[02:53:09.210 --> 02:53:09.670]
Now go ahead.

[02:53:10.150 --> 02:53:12.230]
Have you ever seen Centurions of Rome?

[02:53:12.490 --> 02:53:12.790]
No.

[02:53:13.290 --> 02:53:15.470]
Starting the incomparable miles long?

[02:53:15.930 --> 02:53:16.150]
No.

[02:53:17.050 --> 02:53:17.850]
In unbelievable.

[02:53:18.030 --> 02:53:19.170]
I'm not into eels.

[02:53:19.350 --> 02:53:19.590]
OK.

[02:53:19.670 --> 02:53:20.590]
I'm not having that disgusting.

[02:53:21.110 --> 02:53:22.030]
I'm not into that stuff.

[02:53:22.230 --> 02:53:22.390]
OK.

[02:53:22.390 --> 02:53:23.150]
I'm not into it.

[02:53:23.150 --> 02:53:23.670]
I'm not into it.

[02:53:23.670 --> 02:53:25.530]
Neil straight into freaks of nature.

[02:53:25.710 --> 02:53:25.890]
No.

[02:53:26.190 --> 02:53:26.630]
I'll pass.

[02:53:26.810 --> 02:53:28.330]
He was practically tripping over it.

[02:53:28.410 --> 02:53:28.990]
I'll pass.

[02:53:29.850 --> 02:53:30.450]
OK, Neil.

[02:53:30.570 --> 02:53:30.930]
See around.

[02:53:30.970 --> 02:53:31.290]
OK.

[02:53:31.590 --> 02:53:34.930]
That's what was so important that he had to interrupt you to say that.

[02:53:35.290 --> 02:53:35.470]
Yeah.

[02:53:35.530 --> 02:53:36.610]
Have to be gagged and bound.

[02:53:36.890 --> 02:53:37.510]
Good Lord.

[02:53:38.710 --> 02:53:39.070]
OK.

[02:53:39.310 --> 02:53:40.590]
Have it only when you watched that film.

[02:53:40.870 --> 02:53:42.190]
I guess he thought it was important.

[02:53:43.390 --> 02:53:44.770]
Don't you understand who we're dealing with here?

[02:53:44.830 --> 02:53:46.890]
We're dealing with a fringe of humanity on this show.

[02:53:48.050 --> 02:53:48.550]
Dave County.

[02:53:48.630 --> 02:53:48.810]
Hello.

[02:53:48.930 --> 02:53:49.290]
Justin.

[02:53:50.170 --> 02:53:52.430]
And that's the hoes on that's just thing.

[02:53:52.710 --> 02:53:53.810]
Are you going to speak to us?

[02:53:53.850 --> 02:53:54.970]
You just going to play the radio?

[02:53:55.010 --> 02:53:55.330]
Justin.

[02:53:55.830 --> 02:53:56.990]
Are you going to speak to us?

[02:53:57.090 --> 02:53:58.030]
You just going to play the...

[02:53:58.030 --> 02:53:58.870]
Dave County.

[02:53:58.970 --> 02:53:59.150]
Hello.

[02:53:59.550 --> 02:53:59.790]
No?

[02:54:00.110 --> 02:54:00.290]
Yeah.

[02:54:00.870 --> 02:54:01.550]
I don't.

[02:54:01.550 --> 02:54:01.850]
OK.

[02:54:02.650 --> 02:54:03.170]
What's up?

[02:54:05.350 --> 02:54:07.070]
I'm just getting used to jokes.

[02:54:07.410 --> 02:54:09.390]
Guys, we got more comedians today.

[02:54:09.690 --> 02:54:09.990]
The fry.

[02:54:10.450 --> 02:54:11.250]
How was your vacation?

[02:54:11.670 --> 02:54:12.070]
Terrific.

[02:54:12.230 --> 02:54:13.470]
Well, I wish it would never end it.

[02:54:13.510 --> 02:54:15.330]
I wish I never came back from Matavia down.

[02:54:17.210 --> 02:54:18.050]
I'll tell you what.

[02:54:18.050 --> 02:54:19.950]
I had dinner at Mancuso's restaurant.

[02:54:19.950 --> 02:54:20.950]
It was sensational.

[02:54:20.950 --> 02:54:22.250]
The veal was delicious.

[02:54:22.890 --> 02:54:23.910]
Everything was great.

[02:54:24.070 --> 02:54:26.010]
I had nothing but winners at the track.

[02:54:26.350 --> 02:54:26.990]
It was great.

[02:54:27.330 --> 02:54:27.690]
Uh-huh.

[02:54:28.750 --> 02:54:29.810]
OK, that's good.

[02:54:30.350 --> 02:54:33.550]
Well, I'm just glad to say that...

[02:54:34.090 --> 02:54:34.570]
Yeah.

[02:54:35.670 --> 02:54:36.490]
Spit it out.

[02:54:36.590 --> 02:54:37.070]
Now, come on.

[02:54:37.270 --> 02:54:37.830]
Don't hold back.

[02:54:38.390 --> 02:54:39.310]
No, we missed you.

[02:54:39.450 --> 02:54:42.810]
The thing is that the bird had some awful shows.

[02:54:45.470 --> 02:54:45.950]
And...

[02:54:45.950 --> 02:54:47.090]
Like the one with Dave Berry.

[02:54:47.570 --> 02:54:51.390]
No, the one with Steve Sonsky.

[02:54:51.650 --> 02:54:52.470]
Yeah, with him.

[02:54:52.890 --> 02:54:53.230]
Terrible.

[02:54:53.810 --> 02:54:54.010]
Right.

[02:54:55.190 --> 02:54:57.670]
Yeah, you're right.

[02:54:57.770 --> 02:54:59.090]
I'm starting to enjoy these calls.

[02:54:59.410 --> 02:55:01.090]
Why are you making gurgling sounds?

[02:55:01.250 --> 02:55:02.650]
I thought that it was a funny comment.

[02:55:02.990 --> 02:55:04.010]
OK, take care, Neil.

[02:55:04.190 --> 02:55:04.870]
OK, thank you.

[02:55:04.970 --> 02:55:05.870]
Good call, sir, actually.

[02:55:06.110 --> 02:55:06.890]
Ha, ha, ha.

[02:55:06.930 --> 02:55:07.590]

[02:55:08.490 --> 02:55:08.870]
Oh, Neil.

[02:55:09.130 --> 02:55:09.290]
Yeah.

[02:55:09.970 --> 02:55:11.070]
Um, my name's Al.

[02:55:11.210 --> 02:55:14.170]
I met you over at Baton's strawberry farm.

[02:55:14.350 --> 02:55:14.710]
Oh, yeah.

[02:55:15.290 --> 02:55:15.690]
And...

[02:55:15.690 --> 02:55:16.890]
At Baton's fruit stand.

[02:55:16.970 --> 02:55:17.790]
Yeah, right, right.

[02:55:18.670 --> 02:55:20.430]
And, uh, one time I'll tell you about it,

[02:55:20.510 --> 02:55:22.250]
the first one, I'm glad you're back from your vacation.

[02:55:22.370 --> 02:55:23.130]
I hope you had a good one.

[02:55:23.290 --> 02:55:23.490]
Yeah.

[02:55:23.970 --> 02:55:27.650]
And, uh, you know that record, uh, I-95 song?

[02:55:27.870 --> 02:55:28.050]
Yeah.

[02:55:28.350 --> 02:55:30.070]
If you go over to Peaches and Sunrise,

[02:55:30.370 --> 02:55:32.590]
they have a sign up, it says Neil Rogers song.

[02:55:32.990 --> 02:55:33.270]
Great.

[02:55:33.510 --> 02:55:35.630]
Well, I'm glad they're songy because we can't play it.

[02:55:35.890 --> 02:55:37.230]
Ha, ha, ha.

[02:55:37.230 --> 02:55:38.810]
Yeah, there's so in quite a few of them over there.

[02:55:39.270 --> 02:55:43.710]
But, uh, I want to get with your producer about doing some advertising for the business.

[02:55:43.710 --> 02:55:45.030]
I had spoke to you once before.

[02:55:45.610 --> 02:55:46.590]
And, I have a lot of your names.

[02:55:46.970 --> 02:55:48.590]
You gave me the way you'd named once before.

[02:55:49.470 --> 02:55:49.830]
Yeah.

[02:55:50.510 --> 02:55:51.850]
Can you give the name over there?

[02:55:53.030 --> 02:55:54.730]
Well, why don't we just take your number

[02:55:54.730 --> 02:55:57.430]
and we'll give it, we'll pass it along to the appropriate people.

[02:55:57.730 --> 02:55:58.090]
All right.

[02:55:58.370 --> 02:55:59.890]
Uh, it's five by thirty-

[02:55:59.890 --> 02:56:00.570]
No, no, no, no.

[02:56:00.570 --> 02:56:01.170]
Hold on a minute.

[02:56:01.450 --> 02:56:01.950]
Uh, hold on.

[02:56:01.990 --> 02:56:02.830]
We'll take it off the air.

[02:56:03.450 --> 02:56:03.770]
Okay.

[02:56:03.890 --> 02:56:04.030]

[02:56:04.470 --> 02:56:05.070]
Okay, hold on.

[02:56:05.150 --> 02:56:05.750]
It's on six.

[02:56:06.470 --> 02:56:08.530]
And we can pass it on to a Rhona Barrett.

[02:56:09.050 --> 02:56:10.470]
Let's go to a brown again.

[02:56:10.610 --> 02:56:10.810]

[02:56:12.390 --> 02:56:12.790]

Yes.

[02:56:21.310 --> 02:56:22.110]
A voice.

[02:56:22.670 --> 02:56:23.030]
Voice.

[02:56:23.650 --> 02:56:23.890]
Why there?

[02:56:23.970 --> 02:56:25.650]
Not much of a voice, but a voice.

[02:56:26.790 --> 02:56:28.890]
Uh, a lee-roy knee-men, as are you looking for.

[02:56:29.090 --> 02:56:29.470]
Exactly.

[02:56:30.030 --> 02:56:30.470]
Big mustache.

[02:56:30.770 --> 02:56:31.890]
I'm a little worried about lee-roy.

[02:56:32.110 --> 02:56:32.510]
Uh, yeah.

[02:56:32.710 --> 02:56:34.650]
We're not going to take him to grow that thing, huh?

[02:56:37.230 --> 02:56:40.230]
We're going to be, who's he been sitting under to grow that thing?

[02:56:40.230 --> 02:56:41.470]
Well, well, it's not the story.

[02:56:42.670 --> 02:56:43.970]
So how was your trip?

[02:56:45.250 --> 02:56:45.510]
Okay.

[02:56:45.950 --> 02:56:46.130]

Yeah.

[02:56:48.090 --> 02:56:50.130]
I just want to call you and let you know about lee-roy.

[02:56:50.390 --> 02:56:50.950]

[02:56:54.050 --> 02:56:54.810]
Great call.

[02:56:55.050 --> 02:56:57.510]
We have had a string of them since about 130, boy.

[02:56:57.570 --> 02:56:57.750]
Yeah.

[02:56:58.390 --> 02:56:59.390]

[02:56:59.750 --> 02:56:59.890]

[02:57:22.430 --> 02:57:24.150]
It's the PD over at life.

[02:57:24.670 --> 02:57:25.530]

That is definitely life.

[02:57:27.150 --> 02:57:29.050]
I'm not satisfied with a 10-year-old.

[02:57:29.050 --> 02:57:32.290]
You know, now they got to start piping their music in on our show.

[02:57:32.790 --> 02:57:35.130]
That way, they can put it together, get a 19-year-old.

[02:57:35.170 --> 02:57:35.950]
It was definitely life.

[02:57:36.070 --> 02:57:37.570]
No question at all.

[02:57:38.230 --> 02:57:39.270]

[02:57:39.730 --> 02:57:40.210]
