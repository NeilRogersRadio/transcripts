[00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.940]
As says the anti-bilingual ordinance is prejudice on the books and a front to

[00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.820]
latens and a burning issue in that community. Every time I go out I cannot escape

[00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.100]
from this issue. Let's get it over. He believes David County is ready for another

[00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.900]
debate. I think that we are mature enough. The people, and I'm talking about the

[00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.220]
people that really care about the county, to express our point of view in a

[00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.440]
decent way. Maldez will this week face heavy political pressure to drop the

[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:38.880]
issue but he has made it a mission. And if I fail I would try again two years

[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:45.860]
from now and if two years from now fails I will try two years after. I don't

[00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:53.120]
think that I will die before but I see that they county does not have in their

[00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:00.960]
books. An ordinance that hurt the feeling of a segment of this community. He

[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.100]
knows he might face a recall campaign. If that happened and I lose that will not

[00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.740]
go into stock. And despite the firestorm of hate calls and death threats last week

[00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.600]
Valdez says the issue is too important. I will not go into back off from this

[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:28.080]
because I this is something that hurt the community and I will not go into

[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:36.780]
back off Jim Lonnie W. I. N. Z. News my name was a man is I mean this man is so

[00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.400]
stupid and so desperate and so all alone out there on the edge of that limb

[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.440]
that it's embarrassing it's disgraceful and I wasn't even going to talk about

[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.500]
this today. I said that on Saturday and of course spent Saturday apologizing

[00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.860]
to everybody for four hours and I just want you to know I take it all back

[00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.200]
today okay but no seriously we weren't even going to talk about that we've been

[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.940]
going back to what we've been doing here for a long time and Mr. Mr. Lighthead

[00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.700]
you know if you listen to the show which is say in the column what we've been

[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.160]
doing for seven months on this show we rarely get into heavy issues and we

[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.360]
certainly don't spew hate on this program but boy when it's convenient Mr. Lighthead

[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.680]
becomes a great liar for Knight Ritter and the Miami Herald and I quote Neil

[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.600]
Rogers mouthpiece for our hatred Rogers isn't to blame he merely profits from

[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.480]
hate by bringing it to the surface it's the sick mentality of this town that's

[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.240]
to blame and not even entirely of this town many of Neil Rogers listeners like

[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.200]
himself don't even live in Dade County they live in Broward and had to call

[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.840]
their threats to the Metro Commission last week long distance the appeal of

[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.400]
virulent radio talk host like Rogers is to the frustration of listeners not to

[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.680]
their intellect who tunes in expecting a mild balanced discussion Rogers would

[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.380]
starve without wrath and thus his soaring ratings are not a mark of community

[00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:08.300]
distinction even by writing this column I add grist to the mill Rogers will have

[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.080]
the stuff of a fresh tirade this week urging listeners to call the Herald

[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.440]
keep abuse and cancel their subscriptions the anonymous manipulated legions will

[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:24.620]
do as they're told mindlessly hypnotized by the voice I can almost hear him so

[00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.960]
now you're mindlessly hypnotized do you believe that do you think you're

[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.840]
mindlessly hypnotized for speaking out against the big powerful herald

[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:39.020]
unbelievable absolutely unbelievable the trash this whitehead writes sure I

[00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.020]
listen sometimes he might make you mad as hell but Neil Rogers has never dull

[00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.980]
he doesn't do it alone though the radio man tells people what they want to

[00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.780]
hear otherwise who would listen he appeals to dark underlying rages with the

[00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.620]
skill of a surgeon excising a cancer in the process he serves as a startling

[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.180]
messenger last week it was the bilingual issue and the efforts of Metro

[00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.060]
commissioner George Valdez to rid the county of that ugly English only ordinance

[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.960]
that his panic date counties find so offensive the result of Rogers radio

[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:22.160]
harangs at one point he hung up on Valdez on the air and called him an idiot

[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.160]
was a torrent of telephone abuse to the commission the ugliness ranged

[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.280]
widely with commissioner Sherman win even hearing himself call the Jew bastard

[00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.860]
thus out Florida's inner sickness came vomiting out goaded by the voice on the

[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:44.160]
radio and a torrent that the well-meaning Valdez never anticipated but if

[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.380]
ever there was a message to the commission to leave the damn ordinance alone

[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:53.420]
lying on the shelf like a dirty but toothless dog I'd say this was it rage on

[00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.760]
such a scale only be gets more and it served no purpose in a city divided

[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.320]
against itself but I repeat it's not the creation of Neil Rogers or any other

[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.340]
clever manipulator who fills the airwaves with whatever prompts folks to tune

[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.380]
in get mad sound off the thing that a radio hate merchant thrives on is

[00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.900]
already there eating its out Florida like an ulcer and it's really nothing new

[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.060]
being a zendemic to these subtropics as mosquitoes and mildew it's the nature of

[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.820]
a trouble town this place you see is a city of ruthless runaways people who've

[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.860]
left Jersey City or Evansville or Havana or yes West Virginia in search of an

[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.200]
idol a place in the sun many merely bring their troubles with them because we

[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.000]
can't run away from ourselves so in the strange subtropic light of South Florida

[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.320]
where the sun cooks your brains and the traffic is terrible and people speak

[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.120]
Spanish and Creole and the papers full of mayhem one is just as miserable as

[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.780]
before or even more so for being older and lonely they came as strangers and

[00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.820]
remain as strangers in a metropolis of strangers bitter angry frustrated

[00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:05.680]
strangers with no roots after 20 years home is still someplace else and one day

[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.080]
on the air a voice comes ramping and raging at what a rotten town this is and

[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.600]
what's thinking politicians we have and lousy traffic and Haitians and Cubans

[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.140]
it's a nagging assertive kind of voice and I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to

[00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:23.960]
take it anymore kind of voice and a light comes on and the listener says he

[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:30.140]
saying what I feel and the ratings of neo-roggers take another uptick scary

[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:38.500]
isn't it and the quote from a lying no good miserable moron at the Miami

[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.160]
Harrow

[00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.660]
somebody who's never heard this program would read this column they would think

[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:54.240]
that every day on this show we sit and we spread hate and all we do is

[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.780]
encourage people to hate each other it's interesting that what I've been saying

[00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:03.360]
last Wednesday through Saturday in disgusting this discussing the disgusting

[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.380]
Mr. Valdez and this whole business it's just the opposite that we don't want

[00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.620]
to open up all the old sores we don't want to have encouraged people to hate

[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:16.700]
each other and that that's all that this could possibly accomplish and as far as

[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:21.300]
people's feelings being hurt only Mr. Valdez evidently has his feelings hurt

[00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.940]
because he's so stupid he doesn't understand that the anti-balling will

[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:29.260]
ordinance just has the effect of bringing us back to where we were before 1973

[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:35.540]
a county in the United States of America where people speak English or English

[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.720]
is the language that businesses done in because we're part of the U.S.

[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.520]
of A that's all that's all it really has the effect of doing because a lot of

[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.640]
people's feelings were hurt Mr. Valdez when mayor or and the other

[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:52.180]
metro commissioners arbitrarily 14 years ago decided to declare this the only

[00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.740]
officially bilingual county in America that hurt a lot of people's feelings

[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.760]
because it said to them that maybe they were living in a foreign country not in

[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:07.620]
the U.S. of A now to go back to the beginning of this pathetic column and it

[00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.740]
really is pathetic because it has nothing to do with what this show is all

[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.140]
about and not only is it an attack upon me but it's an attack upon all the

[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:17.200]
people in the audience and you notice there are two references here to the

[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.060]
ratings and that's what bugs the herald see every time these ratings come out

[00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:24.920]
and this show keeps doing better and better with astronomical ratings that

[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.400]
pisses off the people of the herald because they can't stand it because it

[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.540]
means that more and more people are going to be hearing me expose them for what

[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:35.760]
they are for the pandering that they do for the twisting and manipulating of the

[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:40.360]
news that they do and calling those numbers in date three five oh two thousand

[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:45.600]
and thenbroward four six two three thousand and saying adios to the herald

[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.860]
us still away go and that circulation figure that's been dwindling already is

[00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:55.520]
going to keep dropping and dropping and dropping and dropping and the herald is

[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.740]
going to have no place left to go because they're not fooling people in a

[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:03.940]
Cuban community even the most emotional of the people in a Cuban community

[00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:11.240]
don't want to be panned to in such an obvious such a phony transparent way the

[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.640]
Spanish language radio stations panned to some of those people's emotion that's

[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.540]
a different story because they know how to pull the trigger the right

[00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:21.120]
emotional triggers to get those people started but the herald does it in a

[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:26.020]
very phony and a very transparent way and it's an insult it hurts the feelings

[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:29.640]
to quote mr. valdez of people in the community and it certainly hurts the

[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.500]
feelings of those who are non-laton to realize that the major local newspaper

[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.540]
in south florida is not interested in people who don't speak esponial but is

[00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:40.660]
only interested more and more and more in pandering and twisting and

[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:44.340]
manipulating because they got to get their circulation back up in date county

[00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:49.960]
period and that's not according to my paranoia or something that I've created my

[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:53.180]
mind it's according to articles in the Wall Street Journal of Los Angeles

[00:09:53.180 --> 00:10:00.520]
Times the New York Times about the game plan of the Miami herald and going

[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:06.040]
right back to the beginning of mr. lightheads column you know keep saying all

[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.220]
through the article that it's not my fault i'm not at fault for anything it's

[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:12.620]
uh... you know i just bring it out bring out the worst in the people it's all

[00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:17.680]
there many of my listeners like me don't even live in david county to live in

[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:21.080]
broward well mr. lighthead i hate to break the news to you i don't know when the

[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.220]
last time was that you were out of date county and away from your ivory tower

[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:28.760]
in one herald plaza but there's no wall at the date broward line and what

[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.880]
happens in broward and if you do listen to the show you heard me saying this all

[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.020]
week long last week

[00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:34.440]
what happens in date

[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:36.760]
influences all

[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.140]
of south florida

[00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:42.020]
because the rest of the country and the rest of the world looks at what happens

[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:45.660]
in date and what happens in my army as a south florida phenomenon

[00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:51.080]
so all of us suffer those people who depend upon tourism those people who are in

[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.500]
business those people who just would like to live in a community that has a more

[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.200]
decent image we all suffer

[00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:02.180]
this is not a date county issue it's a south florida issue mr. lighthead is if

[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:03.300]
you don't already know that

[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.800]
and i talked about that specifically i said even if you live in broward palm

[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.440]
beach Monroe

[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.720]
you're certainly entitled to call because what these people plan on doing by

[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.940]
opening up this referendum

[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.360]
and opening up all the source again is going to have impact it's going to have

[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.020]
fallout

[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:22.420]
on all of us if they drop nuclear weapons on homestead god forbid tomorrow

[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:26.220]
mr. lighthead those of us who live in broward would be in jeopardy as well

[00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:28.060]
fallout

[00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:35.820]
the appeal of virulent radio talk host rogers would starve without wrath isn't

[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.900]
that interesting that during the last seven months

[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:42.440]
when this show has become primarily comedy and entertainment very little

[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.800]
discussion of substantive issues because the people don't really want to talk

[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:46.540]
about them anymore

[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.540]
i've had the greatest success that i've had in the eleven and a half years i've

[00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:51.180]
been in this market

[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.440]
during these last seven months

[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.100]
but my

[00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:01.580]
mind in my life and my show would starve without wrath according to mr. lighthead

[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.520]
and my soaring ratings are not a mark of community distinction in other words

[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.760]
mr. whitehead is set himself up as a censor

[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:11.620]
as the herald very often does and what he's saying is that you people listen to

[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.240]
this program have lousy taste

[00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:17.820]
that it's a bad reflection upon you that you listen to the oragers

[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:22.620]
like a little child you see this is how the herald respond like little

[00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:26.220]
children all we're not going to put his listings in the radio page anymore

[00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.220]
we've been when he has a guest don't put it in there

[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.280]
of course today that linda thorton said in for me when i was on vacation that

[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:33.900]
made it

[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:37.440]
in the listings in the mimey herald is not interesting is that peculiar

[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.620]
that that made it into the herald radio listings when linda thorton was on

[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:47.000]
when i came back and when fred shots was a guest on this program we don't have

[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.880]
a lot of guests but on those days when we do even them

[00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:53.860]
the listings will not appear in the herald because the herald continues to be

[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.400]
like juvenile delinquents

[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.620]
like a bunch of little brats

[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.780]
and if somebody dares to attack them if somebody dares to expose them for what they

[00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:07.760]
are and what they're doing and how desperate they are then they will strike back

[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:13.200]
in a most juvenile way and that's what mr. lighthead is done in this column

[00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:18.640]
sure i listen sometimes he might make you mad as hell but neal rogers is never

[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.080]
dull on the one hand he's condemning the other people in the market for

[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:22.480]
listing

[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:27.400]
what a shame it is that my ratings keep going up and on the other hand he's

[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:31.200]
defending the reason that he listens on occasion and probably more than just

[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.220]
on occasion and you can bet your life that he's listening right now he probably

[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:39.000]
has the radio turned up so loud he's getting sexual excitement from my from the

[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.220]
voice as he calls it on the show

[00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:48.740]
he appeals to dark underlying rages with the skill of a surge in excising a

[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:49.200]
cancer

[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.400]
and he talks about mr. valdez

[00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:58.400]
eight oh boy this line really gets me

[00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:03.920]
south florida's inner sickness came vomiting out go to buy the voice on the radio

[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:08.760]
in a torrent that the well-meaning valdez never anticipated if you think mr. valdez

[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:12.780]
well-meaning and that's the reason that i played that peace with jimlony a minute

[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.360]
ago after last break

[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:18.720]
you heard him in his own voice in his own broken english say no matter what

[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:22.640]
happens he's gonna keep bringing his back over and this is the same man who said

[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:26.060]
three years ago on my show he would never bring it up and now he says he's

[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:30.100]
gonna keep bringing it back over and over and over again until the day that he

[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:33.000]
dies he's gonna keep bringing us over the head with us

[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.200]
oh we just have this a flash

[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:44.080]
dick capin i didn't hear the interview but i heard that it was one of those you

[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:47.060]
know what a bunkies uh... marshmallow interviews yesterday the interview

[00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:48.320]
dick capin of the herald

[00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:53.420]
and we now find through a very reliable source that mr. capin would not appear

[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.800]
with bunkie biori yesterday unless i wasn't mentioned

[00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.600]
isn't that interesting

[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.460]
so now mr. capin sets the rules for what's going to be discussed when he

[00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:04.480]
appears on any program

[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.640]
i mean anybody who's afraid to appear with bunkie biori means got to be desperate

[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:09.320]
to begin with

[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:13.160]
bunkie toasts the best marshal marshmallow since the we need rose last summer

[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:13.500]
okay

[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.320]
all of his questions are marshmallows for politicians

[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.900]
uh... newspaper publishers you name it and they always have been

[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.860]
but mr. capin wanted to make very sure that i would not be

[00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.780]
a topic of conversation i guess they would have been a little embarrassing

[00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:30.700]
especially if mucky would have asked how many subscriptions have been canceled

[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:31.760]
what the number was

[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.080]
and how far the circulation has gone down at the illustrious herald

[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:39.360]
you see mr. capin you've got to look yourself in the mirror you like to blame me

[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.380]
and you like to blame everybody else but look in the mirror

[00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.840]
now what i first came to this time eleven years ago plus

[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.980]
the mimey herald at that time was still a pretty decent newspaper there were

[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:53.440]
still childish and the first time i attacked and they wouldn't put my listings

[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.000]
in the paper there's still like little children

[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.980]
but it was still nonetheless a pretty good newspaper

[00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:03.120]
and a pretty moderate newspaper they hadn't gone into full gear on their

[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.220]
pandering process not not at all

[00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:08.840]
that didn't happen until mariel when they decided to take sides

[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.360]
and when they became some of the great promoters of the mariel boatlip

[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.380]
and some of the great promoters of the metro rail as they had been the late

[00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.120]
seventies

[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.680]
and then of course promoters of bob martinis

[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:23.540]
everything that's been poisoned to this community everything that's been

[00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:27.380]
detrimental to this community the herald has promoted the herald has been in

[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:30.620]
bed with and now the herald turns around it says all there's that ugly

[00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:35.100]
messenger that ugly voice on the radio he brings out the dark side all the

[00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.560]
negative things in the people here

[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.000]
and white head all through the column keeps contradicting himself

[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:44.260]
all don't blame rogers he's not he's not the fault the people here are this

[00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.280]
and the people here are that their frustrated and their better about pop pop

[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:50.560]
he be so i guess what he's saying is that i'm not supposed to discuss the

[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.400]
truth on the show

[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:55.560]
as long as i do like the herald does and lie a lot that i'm a good guy

[00:16:56.100 --> 00:17:00.560]
and i'm not going to do that to make mr light head happy or mr capon happy

[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:03.820]
or any of those other bastards over there at one herald plaza i'm not going to

[00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:04.680]
come on here and lie

[00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:10.220]
and must be tremendously disconcerting to them to see for once you see the

[00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:14.340]
only way that they can survive is by like the politicians many of them keeping

[00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:19.440]
the town divided divide and conquer the triethnic community boy they just love

[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.040]
that phrase

[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.880]
you know stick the back to the blacks you know back into liberty city and over

[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:28.060]
town nobody cares about them and let's put the anglos against the latinos and

[00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.640]
man you know we're gonna win because we got the numbers now

[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:37.180]
and all of a sudden wqba and salad and all of the Cuban leaders and neo rogers

[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:41.340]
and uh... uh... everybody saying the same thing they're saying we don't need

[00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:45.120]
this referendum we don't need to argue we don't need to hate each other we the

[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.340]
last year and a half we seem to be doing a little better than we had been

[00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:52.080]
let's have a little peace and harmony among the ethnic groups in the community

[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:56.320]
and let's everybody try to get along and all of a sudden they they can't handle that

[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.360]
oh my god everybody get along what do we do then

[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:07.060]
so you see i have done a service here because i brought to the attention of the

[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:11.360]
public the kind of divisive efforts that are made by the people like george valdez

[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.600]
who wants to be a professional cuban instead of a commissioner for all of

[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:19.820]
the day county all the pain the pain it hurt it hurt it hurt

[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:25.380]
it hurts me when a jackass like george valdez won't take no for an answer

[00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:29.260]
and no matter how many phone calls come in you hear him in his own voice he's

[00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:33.020]
gonna continue this no matter what the consequences and that's disgraceful and

[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.440]
that alone should be caused for his recall

[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:36.800]
get rid of them

[00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.680]
let's have commission and but the rest of the commission has got nothing to be

[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:41.380]
proud of either

[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:45.940]
the fact that they've allowed one yo-yo like him one ignorant yo-yo

[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:50.480]
to get them into this whole thing see they thought that they would go along and

[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:54.260]
put it on the ballot and nobody would you know expose this for what it was

[00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.800]
and all of a sudden the erudges got on the year and why should it have only been me

[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:01.540]
see that's the thing that disturbs me tremendously why should it have had to be me

[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:06.420]
wired all the other lead why isn't the beacon council and a greater Miami chamber of commerce

[00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:11.020]
wired all these other so-called civic leaders why didn't they immediately come out last Wednesday

[00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:13.840]
and say the things that i said on the air here last Wednesday

[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:19.060]
these are the self-appointed leaders who are so concerned about the image of this community

[00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:22.240]
in the future of this community where the hell were they last Wednesday

[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.620]
unbelievable thank you fix it

[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:37.260]
and i think that mr valdez owes this community an apology

[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:44.740]
for being a stubborn fool a stubborn old fool a stubborn old illiterate fool

[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:52.040]
sorry that we didn't have this on saturday and i apologize for them

[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:56.480]
thanks to one of our listeners and the radio audience one of those horrible listeners who

[00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.860]
listen to this show we've got it today

[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:31.840]
and

[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.480]
a

[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:37.060]
uh

[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:43.540]
I love the onion, what I don't write

[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:49.060]
I'm wrong that it's been done

[00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:01.140]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:07.360]
I'm sorry, please accept my apology

[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:18.140]
But love is blind and I was too blind to see

[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:23.960]
But love is blind and I was too blind to see

[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:29.380]
You tell me, I'm mistaken

[00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:37.780]
I'm part of the end of the book

[00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:40.380]
I don't write

[00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:47.300]
I'm wrong that it's been done

[00:21:47.300 --> 00:22:05.440]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:10.360]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.300]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:28.240]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.160]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.900]
Let's look at the Webster Dictionary for Mr. Valdes

[00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:36.980]
The word never, not ever, at no time

[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.560]
Not under any condition, not in any degree

[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:48.520]
Not ever, Mr. Valdes, that's what never means

[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:55.720]
It's 16 before 11 at WINZ or 14 or 15 or somewhere in there within about three or four minute radius

[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:59.020]
We don't really nitpick on this show, let's do our last break and we'll come right back

[00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:01.820]
Here with you till 2, stand major, we'll be along at 2

[00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:09.180]
And stand as promised me, one of the first orders of business on a show today will be to call and cancel the herald on the air

[00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:14.100]
And shame on stand for subscribing to the herald even now, right?

[00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:19.880]
And try to convince him and he's finally seen the error in his ways and will be canceling on the air

[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:24.240]
Can we crank this monitor up a little bit because on a weekend I think somebody turned it down

[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.840]
Can we just go back there and crank it up?

[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:31.220]
Because I honestly, you know by 1 o'clock usually I can't hear myself but now it's like desperate

[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:35.120]
So if we can really crank it up good, in fact we can do the whole, that's great

[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:39.640]
In reverb, we can just get a little reverb in the background and we can do the show in stereo

[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:45.400]
Like the good old days when we used to have all that RF bleeding through in the background, we can bring back the old days

[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.120]
Because we like our listeners to feel comfortable

[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.880]
Anyway, and of course our douchebag listeners out there because Mr. Lighthaz has already told you exactly what you are

[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:59.960]
And I want to see some cancellations at the herald today that's going to make Mr. Kepen grow new hair on that balding head

[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:06.200]
Okay, I want to see thousands of people finally come to their senses

[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:11.660]
And I was listening to a good part of Mike Spindell show yesterday and I heard one lady who called in

[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:16.580]
And some nice things to say about me in this show and agreed with a lot of what I've been saying

[00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:22.140]
But she said well as he's been thinking about canceling the herald but she hasn't been able to bring herself to do it yet

[00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:27.160]
You know you'd be amazed at how much better you'll feel really once you've canceled it

[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:35.420]
And it's interesting Mr. Lighthaz also characterizes you see everything I do according to him and according to the herald is always in a real hostile way

[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:40.800]
I haven't suggested that anybody calls the herald and he'll abuse upon them those are his words

[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:44.980]
Urge them to call the herald he'll abuse upon them and cancel their subscriptions

[00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:48.280]
The last part is accurate cancel their subscriptions yes

[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.720]
But he'll abuse upon them no

[00:24:50.720 --> 00:25:00.840]
I haven't said that any more than we've solicited death threats for Mr. Valdez or hate calls or anti-Semitic calls or any of those other negative calls that are attributed to me

[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:07.560]
But of course this is business as usual because as I've always told you when something bad happens I'm responsible for it

[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:09.960]
And as Brenda Lee said I'm sorry

[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:14.660]
No matter what it is that somebody's upset about I'm responsible for it

[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:19.560]
If a tornado touches down in sweet water Neil Rogers is responsible for it

[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:25.040]
If somebody calls Mr. Valdez and calls him a douchebag I'm responsible for it

[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.520]
I mean grow up will you Charlie grow up?

[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:36.760]
Boy I mean for a pathetic old fart like you you think you've been around the block long enough to realize that you can't blame one person for everything bad that goes on

[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:45.280]
And I want to see them pay a wicked price for continuing to distort and to lie

[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.460]
How can they have it both ways?

[00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:54.480]
On Thursday the heralded and of course the line that they would love to give you as well you know the editorial board Mr. Whitehead's column are totally separate

[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.180]
Right, right

[00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:58.400]
Sure

[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:09.280]
Thursday two editorials not one but the two lead editorials agreeing that we don't need this referendum agreeing that Mr. Valdez is all wet

[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:17.280]
And agreeing that the Metro commissioners should never have caved in which is exactly what I've said and exactly what I've urged you to call and tell them

[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:26.240]
But now we have to get even because those ratings are getting too high and it's getting out of hand and we're losing a lot of power and a lot of subscribers

[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:37.460]
So now we got to get even so let's do a real slice job by name see Whitehead has written about me in the past usually by in you window very rarely does he specifically mentioned my name on occasion he has

[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:43.220]
But I mean this is as blatant as you can get Neil Rogers mouthpiece for our hatred

[00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:52.220]
He's listening now the rest of you when you listen feel guilty okay seeing that song by Brenda Lee you know you gotta be sorry that you listen

[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:56.600]
But when he listens it's okay because I'm never dull what is it that you want

[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:06.500]
Bunky called he's upset with me will tell Bunky that we speak the truth on the show and I've said that many times before Bunky tosses marshmallows

[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:08.960]
That's gonna be a new movie by the way

[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:20.140]
He didn't that come from Ron Harrison is that what you said well Ron what can I tell you

[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:28.340]
Ron owes an apology to my audience and to me for a spewing misinformation and he got that from Tom Gallagher who gave it to him

[00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:32.520]
So Tom owes an apology to me and to my audience and

[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:37.560]
Bunky owes an apology to the whole human race for those marshmallow those cream puff questions Bunky

[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:43.780]
Mr. Mayor Mr. Mayor all your wonderful Mr. Mayor all you put us on the map Mr. Mayor

[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:52.300]
Bunky only wishes that Maurice for a would make a comeback boy he loves every part of Maurice's body from head to toe

[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:56.060]
Air V follicle on his body Bunky Shmunky loves him

[00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:57.840]
Bunky

[00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:01.720]
You can drop the why

[00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:16.340]
So if you ever if you want to have a weeny roast and you want somebody to do the marshmallows right invite Bunky and his lobotomous still come along as a tandem team

[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:23.720]
You'll never guess what movie was on cinematics last night as part of the previews

[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:33.200]
One of those bonus movies that they're not really showing yet, but it was on and I caught the last hour of it stand by me

[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:40.900]
Well it had its moments, but it was such a depressing such a depressing I mean if you were blown away by that movie

[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:49.300]
It reminds me of Candice Russell on would leave foul or this morning who was attacking the untouchables how anybody could not have liked the untouchables beats the hell out of me

[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:58.440]
And then both Candice and Bill what's his name our former friend from the herald both of them are talking about what a brilliant performance by Robert De Niro and Academy award winning

[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:05.400]
Performance as as Al Capone he's hardly in the movie he's like 40 seconds I think in the movie you know he's not in the movie

[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:11.300]
But it's because it's Robert De Niro therefore we ought to consider him for an Academy Award you know forget about

[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:26.300]
What's his name there Sean Connery who was great he was great in the movie forget about him but Robert De Niro all brilliant brilliant what a portrayal and how he was crying if the opera you know was he crying on his own or did somebody write that in the script you know

[00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:39.860]
Oh really this is my con no good that's good we don't want to overdo it not on a Monday not this early in a week in spite of what Charlie says our audience is not that bad they don't deserve you

[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:56.460]
Oh she doesn't like yeah she was going on about the violence of the baseball bat scene and all she was just upset but stand by me was very depressing and it was very pressing and at the end so what does that have to do with it it was still depressing

[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:26.440]
It was very depressing and most of the kids were ugly anyway so you know who wants to see that but seriously it was a depressing movie and then at the end he's writing this you know and about this kid Chris who was the only good one in the bunch by the way but very young okay I do want to say very young like there were 12 years old in the movie okay I mean even Stan would be embarrassed by that but he's writing this and thinking back and all in any tells about the story

[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:41.800]
about his friend Chris who became a lawyer and was in a bar and this guy pulled out a knife and got into a fight with somebody and he tried to intervene he got stabbed in the neck and died and he hadn't seen him in 10 years but yeah it was so depressing morbid

[00:30:44.120 --> 00:31:11.780]
and it was absolutely no way reflection of life in the 50s in fact it was really interesting as if anybody with an IQ of over three would catch it they were using expressions that nobody used in the 50s you got it you got it nobody said that in the 50s that wasn't a 50s nobody ever said from that you got it or it would be like they said go for it you know I mean there were expressions that nobody ever heard of in the 50s that they were using but of course some of you who are a little too dense to understand that

[00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:41.760]
who gets swept away by emotion and who cry at anything I mean this guy cried at the opening scene in the godfather when Marlon Brando was fondling that ugly cat so what does that tell you so if there's anybody out there you know what it reminds me of it's like those guys who called in who must have been shields they must have all worked at the shops over there about the gallery and then we never heard from them again they all disappeared pronto when we expose the fact that the gallery is like a ghost town

[00:31:41.780 --> 00:32:01.300]
and anybody who wants to troll in a mall should go to the Broward Mall where all the beautiful bodies are well except for two that I can think of immediately but nothing is perfect but anyway if you would like to discuss this with us and I noticed that nobody wanted to talk to Mike yesterday but that's not unusual because nobody ever wants to talk to Spindell anyway okay

[00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:25.320]
is a lot of people who listen for some bizarre reason they did very well and the ratings on Sunday and I congratulated him for that I say it again but Mike I've been trying to tell you for a long time they don't like you they don't want to speak to you they don't want to know from you they don't want to discuss your subjects they don't want to call well some of them want to call just to irritate you and drive you nuts they don't like you they don't like the meds they don't like that stupid little cap they don't like anything

[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:50.020]
and he doesn't want to accept that he just doesn't want to accept and then I guess was a little bit out of shape because I said that his ratings be real good to or something like that and of course being very very sensitive about all that racial stuff by any just had a nervous breakdown about that and they do be good I mean what's wrong with that a six five on Sunday morning that be fantastic

[00:32:52.000 --> 00:33:18.600]
I mean if George Valdez can come up with some of the phrases he did in that tape I mean just butchering the language butchering okay let's give our numbers out and I have a feeling that maybe we'll get a couple of calls in the next hour and what we really want to concentrate on today is saying audio's to the Harold really I mean this should be just one more little one more little notch in their coffin as far as I'm concerned one more excuse to say hey you know I can survive without them real well and the Harold and they three five oh two thousand

[00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:34.600]
and then Broward four six two three thousand and you don't have to heap abuse upon them I mean if you want to you know it's a free world but just to get rid of them you know our numbers in day six two four ninety four hundred six two four ninety four hundred in

[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:48.020]
place in esponial forget it in Broward five two four ninety four hundred five two four ninety four hundred and Broward and Michael Wolf is here with local and area news headlines we have some really exciting world news from CBS at the top of the

[00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:54.120]
R as we check to see if the globe is still spinning around on the outside in the real world and then we'll come back at 1106

[00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:07.900]
of course a year ago I did a bit for the morning show called Halendale Rice and we were approached by a gentleman who

[00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:23.220]
produces the mind device jackets satin jackets he has the what you call it the franchise rights on those he came to me and asked first of all for me to do some

[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:35.220]
answering machine messages for his business and using the dawn Johnson voice that some people say I do okay and then on the back of the tape he said you know I really love

[00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:45.760]
that howl and the advice would you throw that on the back of the tape for me so I did and of course in the next coming months we wound up doing a promotion with his company a

[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:57.560]
co-promotion where we at a local night club and we uh... air the episode of Miami vice-to-season premiere on the big screens and the giveaway bunch of his jackets and things like that but the

[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:15.040]
man wound up going over to Neil Rogers and taking that that debt without my authority over there claiming of course that it was his and he had the

[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:21.780]
machine messages or whatever uh... he claimed that he had a canceled check that said I had out and out sold it to him

[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:28.860]
and you may have heard several months ago he and I went round and round on Mr. Rogers show but they're Mr. Rogers neighborhood

[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:39.500]
uh... we went round and round on the air about who owned the rights to that and uh... he wound up producing evidence letters from lawyers and all of this

[00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.920]
business and uh...

[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:47.580]
you know firstly i'm not going to sit on on on this show and talk bad about him or talk bad about

[00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:55.980]
Neil because as I understood it he had done some favors for Neil he had provided them with some things that's as I understand it

[00:35:56.500 --> 00:36:04.120]
and so how could Neil get on and talk bad about it but uh... and originally I was not getting the credit for that for that

[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:11.820]
bit and they have played that for months and months and I understand that didn't exactly hurt Neil's ratings that that cause a big

[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:20.920]
stir over the people with halendale and that that uh... that helped him out just a little bit but uh... one thing that was never brought out

[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:28.380]
and I never thought about it this gentleman who claimed that uh... he owned the spitting to do whatever he wanted to with it

[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:31.260]
uh... was the fact that in most radio contracts

[00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:36.580]
Mr. Rogers and Mr. Bailey if you're listening and I assume that you are

[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:45.080]
uh... in most radio contracts as a cause and it says that everything that you do for that radio station during the term of your employment remains

[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:50.600]
then and forever even after you leave the sole property of the radio station that's why you hear

[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:57.340]
a guy's commercials and you're you know you're wondering where did he go off to i never hear him on the air anymore but he's commercial

[00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:06.120]
that's because radio stations it's usually it's a standards built into his contract so this gentleman that thought that I had sold him that bit

[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:13.420]
it would have been like if I had sold in the Brooklyn Bridge I had no right to sell it to him so if he thought that I did and

[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:22.500]
a fool in his money or soon parted but uh... here it is live and in person and probably the first time on this radio station

[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:27.300]
that uh... historical and hysterical hopefully that uh... howl and a vice

[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:35.940]
there to my amy cop with a hot new beets there are the streets fighting cry

[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:38.660]

[00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:51.480]
