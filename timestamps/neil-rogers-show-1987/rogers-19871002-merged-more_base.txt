[00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.660]
I beg your pardon.

[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:14.620]
Hello, it's Neil. Is it Kyle? No, this is Neil. Oh, Neil. We're just picking him right up today, sir. We're just jumping right into the phone.

[00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.440]
Very good. Neil. This is John from on in Coral Springs. Yeah, John. I know you're not hurting for this, but I'd like to pledge my two hours to the show.

[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:33.460]
Oh, yeah, let's take pledges for quarter hours. Okay. Let's take pledges from all the people we've offended. Yeah, our Joey thawing. Yeah. Only you have to be calling from Cheek to Wagon, New York, sir.

[00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:44.660]
Is Glenn over there. Yeah, he's here. Land and Lake to give a thumbs up to Blue Velvet. All right. And by me and critique on a new one. Yes, sir. Jeff Strenker comes to Carroll City.

[00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:58.120]
It blew velvets on this week and also really cool. I'll tell you this is going to be a big month for movies on the cables. You notice that? Yeah. Why is that a new fall season? I love. Have you noticed that? Yeah.

[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:13.520]
Big line up this weekend over there. It's true. Yeah. Stand by me and bigger than life. What's stand by day? Yeah. All the heavies are coming this way. Dave doing a tabletop tonight. Yep. It's joyful. Neil, I'll be out there and I'm looking forward to it.

[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:39.080]
Okay. Keep your hands off Dave now. I'll even urge. What for the right. I don't know about you, but my life is progressing without the football. Amazing. Just amazing. Biggest invest football game of the weekend.

[00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:56.620]
I heard stand by the way. Say something really dumb the other day, which is not unusual. Our stand our stand. He said that the FSU was going to destroy the hurricane. I mean, that's so ridiculous. That's ludicrous. And I don't happen to be a big hurricane football fan. I like. You know, Hurricane baseball.

[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:12.960]
Football, Jimmy Johnson's not one of my favorite people. And I just never gotten crazy about it. This game going to be close or is it no no hurricane or destroy them? Okay. I'm telling you. It's a game here. Pudge your brains out. No, it's in Tennessee. Okay. On TV, probably. Probably.

[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:42.940]
I'm going to be watching every minute of it. I'm going to be watching cable. And then you'll be watching the braves. Oh, yeah. Anyway, we got all these great movies coming up. Stand by me. Blue Velvet. I'm probably going to miss a brave game. My father, the odd father. Yeah. All these movies. Oh, the Godfather. Yeah. Oh, that's on all my long part. One, two even parts that haven't been filmed yet. I'm just obsessed. Anyway, that's one of the things we wanted to talk about. I got sidetracked before. Are there other people out there who are like obsessed with either movies or games?

[00:02:42.960 --> 00:03:02.320]
TV shows do think sure. I mean, oh, and also not landing was on last night. Not too exciting. No, I was not. Pat Peterson wasn't on. It was. It was pretty depressing. I agree. And this year, by the way, they're not shooting Dona Mills through a no. No, it's through a brick wall.

[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:11.220]
It's phenomenal. She never looked better. Okay, Jeff Ray is here and he's going to I'm sure get through these headlines with no problem. And we go to a CBS for the world news at the top of the hour.

[00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:23.800]
Mine is Liberty Mutual and they McLaughlin. There are a lot of tapes in the mail. Okay, I want to thank our W.I. and Z engineering staff and only took two of them to get the little pot back on its thing here. You know what I'm saying?

[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.740]
Are you following or are you going to get the lost in your mail again now? Well, I've seen the way you operate around mail call.

[00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:40.320]
This note from Jill. Oh, yeah, Jill. She sent the pictures today. Yeah, and this note she gave me. Let me see it. Is it personal? No, it's real.

[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:48.600]
You're a sweetie bird. Yes. Oh, that's a good name. That's why we hadn't thought of sweetie bird. That's the best way I could describe you.

[00:03:48.600 --> 00:04:04.060]
I just wanted to tell you that since I met you something strange has been happening to me. Yeah, me too. You must be contagious. Well, she's got that far right. Yeah, she is rare ornithological diseases. She's okay.

[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:13.200]
The sexist word is ornithological close could be. But anyway, Jill certainly made my day. Now Jill's probably in school so she can't hear the show today.

[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:22.020]
I probably so is everybody else in the whole. I know these are all teeny poppers. I beg your pardon. You heard me shame on you.

[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:34.140]
And there are pictures of these people at the ice cream store. There are all kinds of pictures of Brian here. Remember him? Remember what he used to talk about him? Yeah, Brian and a lady who asked me to take a picture and show to stand.

[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.500]
If you're listening to any audience, you can just look in the little speaker in your radio.

[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:49.000]
Here's Brian making a milkshake. Isn't that cute? What's written on the back? Little it says Brian in the process of making a milkshake. I'm reading them. Okay.

[00:04:49.620 --> 00:05:04.720]
Sorry. Mr. Nosebeek. Here's Rob and a friend. Rob from Windixie. Here's Rob from Windixie again. Oh, and here's a. Here's a young man. She says looks like Jason Getrich. Do you think he looks like Jason Getrich?

[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:21.340]
Bagley. Bagley. He's a nice guy, but here's Jason Getrich with a friend. Look what they're doing. These kids today. Oh my God. Look at this picture here. This must be Marcy and Jamie.

[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:38.900]
Oh my God. There's Joe with their brother Jason. That is Jill. Yeah. Just hands off of my picture to look at. There's Josh. And that Brian boy just keeps coming back to famous Brian.

[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:48.580]
And there's Brian Josh and Josh's best friend. There they are. And they all look a lot happier and lots more pleasant in these pictures than they did on Monday, but that's wayco.

[00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:56.720]
You know what I'm saying? That's the way it goes. And where's that little note that I had? Here it is. And I don't believe this. Is this is this for real?

[00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:15.260]
Neil, keep shopping at Windixie and keep up your show. Rob. Is that for real? Well, it's everything spelled correctly. See some people now. Didn't I try to explain this the other day? Some people have a good sense of humor. Am I right? And some people just don't get it.

[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:21.440]
And some people can like a little bit of attention. And then there are other people to get all surly. They probably listen to Joey Reynolds. You know.

[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:30.620]
And they get all been other shape. There's a nice note in here from Jill and the thank you, Jill. Yeah. Great. Great pictures too, by the way. Yes.

[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:41.220]
I wouldn't go that far. No, she's nice. I think she's a knockout. And then we have something here that's shaking. I wonder if this is as good as the sand that came in here.

[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:54.320]
Now what are you doing? What are you doing? Did you see that? Did you see him reach over and pick up my letter from Jill? I love her handwriting. Good. See it? Good. My own personal note. The nosiest beat you.

[00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:08.020]
You were my note. Now did I give you my note and let you read nothing in your note? There's a lot of personal things in there from Jill. She and I got a little thing going. Yeah, right. Good luck to you. Well, you never know. You never know. It's never too late to change your ways.

[00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.580]
If that would please, Joey, if that would make him happy.

[00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:22.460]
Isn't this cute? We have this morning. We got that dictionary puzzle. And now we have the rotary nose clipper.

[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:33.380]
All kinds of cute little stuff in the mail today. And remember I talked to you today about arsenic and oleis? Well, they didn't send the old lace, but somebody did send a little jar or something else.

[00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:42.700]
Or even helping hand the fragrance of love. What they wrote on the label. Wait a minute. Okay. What did they write on the label? Just read it. It's good.

[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:57.820]
Can you read it from there? No. It just. Well, yeah, I can tell you what it says. It says forward to Neil Rogers. Glenn Hill, keep your hands off. You you pervert. Listen, anybody in this audience that wants to send anything to me.

[00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:04.120]
If you should write on the envelope or the package or whatever bird hands off, that's what it says you pervert.

[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.520]
Here's a little bottle. It says helping hand the fragrance of love.

[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.360]
What is that smell?

[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:21.640]
Boy, it works fast, dude, doesn't it? So we thank all the people for sending this mountainous crap in here today, huh?

[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.180]
Boy, this has been quite a day out and up what crap?

[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.420]
Dave County, hello.

[00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.340]
Doodster. What?

[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.360]
Mr. Doodster. Doodster. Yeah, this is Doodster.

[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:39.660]
Hey, listen, are you on pretty good terms with Hank Goldberg? Yeah, Hank's a good guy. He's a pretty good guy, right?

[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.760]
Even if he can't give him, you know, an objective opinion because he works for a bunch of douchebags.

[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.640]
Exactly. But I'm listening to Mr. Ego. Is the off-and-programmed? Yeah.

[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:54.020]
Lasting Goldberg's credibility and self-reliant more over the work. I gotta get away with that.

[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:59.840]
Yeah, I heard I heard one rip yesterday. I mean he was disgusting. How does the station put up with an amateur in Bissol White-Kenn?

[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:07.160]
No, he's a professional in Bissol, no, no. I caught up CNN to verify something. He invited himself on Crossfire tomorrow night.

[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.840]
Oh, good. Yeah, he's on Crossfire a lot, you know. He's gone. He's got to get his ego fixed.

[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.820]
I just wanted to know what you know Goldberg. How's he going to get away with this?

[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:20.140]
I don't know. Well, Hank's, you know, pretty good-natured guy. He knows small potatoes when he sees it.

[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:24.140]
All right. Well, I just wanted to get your opinion on it. Don't worry about Hank. Okay, dude.

[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:29.700]
Okay. I'll read it there. Doodster. It sounded just like, what's his name? My Anthony.

[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:36.080]
Look at this mail today. I'm telling you. It's just one of the wildest days and it's all great stuff.

[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:41.860]
I never heard the name Neil Rogers until I arrived on Harbor Island two weeks ago.

[00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:50.660]
This is Bob, a 49-year-old grandfather. Chicago raised the bears, loves the bears.

[00:09:55.620 --> 00:10:00.160]
Look at this. Look at the writing. Just a great letter. Mm-hmm. Little pictures.

[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.060]
Anyway, we're just reading the mail. So if you hear a lot of dead-air, don't worry about it. Okay.

[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:13.100]
We're still here. We're okay. And somebody I know has got his thing all over the phone. Have you noticed?

[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:21.900]
Who is that? Is that anybody we know? Scott Lijer. Moaning. When you please get, you know, you're spreading germs on our windows.

[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:27.720]
We have news people who have to work in that studio. He's got his ass stuck on the window in there.

[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:34.320]
Do you believe that? Any amazing part of it is, well, I don't want to tell the audience. I would be embarrassing.

[00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:40.240]
It's like nothing there. It's like smooth. I have never seen anything so embarrassing.

[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:46.180]
And I look like he just came from the Michael J. Fox fan club. All smooth on the other side.

[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.220]
What was that supposed to mean? I have no idea.

[00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.660]
Is there a fault that I like a point one? I mean, is that our fault?

[00:10:53.660 --> 00:11:01.020]
No, they're getting openly hostile. Yeah. We went up there to cut a couple of spots in FM production in one of their 82 production studios this morning.

[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:06.720]
And boy, they are really turning. They take some days to recover. Well, just wait.

[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.180]
Okay, let's go on to Broward. Hello.

[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.180]
Harry, you put my eats, Mosseum. Go on, Foley.

[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.060]
Oh, no, you're not, Jamie. Did you forget what Naita said?

[00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:25.740]
No way, Mosseum. No way is your mother and those two evil step sisters coming over here tonight.

[00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:30.840]
No, no. It's feel for Mjannite with our idols. Stand major in Neil Rogers.

[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:39.420]
Oh, no, you don't. I am not sitting here while stand majors undresses you with his lear and ingeer and that Neil Rogers eats a set of house in home.

[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:42.100]
Jamie, I mean so much to me and my sister.

[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:46.360]
All right. All right. Just this once. Hey, what happened to my bowling money?

[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:53.000]
Oh, oh, that. Well, I forgot to tell you the only way I can get them to come over was to bribe their agent, the bird.

[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:54.260]
What? With Simon?

[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.840]
Not yet. Just the lovely rope chain with his name engraved on it.

[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:05.560]
Will Stan and Neil really dinner over the evil home of Marcy and Jamie?

[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.280]
The last known personality to eat there was Lee Fowler.

[00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:11.900]
And he was never heard from again.

[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:13.860]
They're here.

[00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.420]
A baby. You're the greatest.

[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:21.440]
Mama, Mama told me.

[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.340]
Stay away from those bird brains.

[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:32.160]
He's probably an ordinary was back in FM page him doing a sequel to this.

[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:40.180]
Really? Yeah. He'll tell you it's a takeoff of the honeymooners that hold skit is a takeoff of the honeymooners.

[00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:48.140]
When he started to cut it yesterday, he came to me and he says, I'm going to do a spoof of the honeymooners on this Jamie and Marcy thing.

[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:51.600]
That's the honeymooners theme at the beginning and through the whole thing wrong.

[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:55.960]
That's not the honeymooners thing. Yes, it is. That the honeymooners theme?

[00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:03.360]
Yes, see? Yeah. All right. Leonard says it is. Kyle is apoplectic says it's not.

[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.300]
It's certainly not psycho.

[00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:06.500]
Jeez.

[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:14.000]
You guys. We have a major contract on the studio ladies and gentlemen.

[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.880]
Page J. Michaels. He's not who's not it.

[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.920]
Let some of the callers get in on the Hello. Hello.

[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.360]
Okay. I know there's a good. Hello.

[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.580]
Good morning. Yes, sir.

[00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:29.540]
Really? It's funny. Vatican. Yeah. My son.

[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.240]
Get out of here, sir. Hello. Hello.

[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:36.980]
Neil. Yeah. You don't have to look any further. This is deep throat with the answer. Yes, sir.

[00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:44.320]
That the theme is on that is the honeymooners opening scene. The real name of it is called My Greatest Love Written by Jackie Gleason.

[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:48.960]
The fondue you sang was called Moonlight so Nade which was used on his TV show.

[00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:53.520]
Okay. Absolutely correct. Now what I said.

[00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:58.000]
Change the round. I want 90 seconds to get all my material on.

[00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:58.980]
Okay. Go ahead.

[00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.160]
Okay. 88. 87.

[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:05.240]
Are you going to melt in the middle of the night? Yeah.

[00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.620]
I want you to try to just strike a special that eel.

[00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:09.120]
Pomeran.

[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.380]
J said it's honeymooners.

[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:12.820]
It is.

[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.080]
So I guess that's what it is. I know.

[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.800]
Well, I guess we owe somebody a deep apology. I would agree with that.

[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:23.120]
Well, here's my foot. Let's see how deep you can apologize. Hello. Hello. Are you there?

[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.480]
Go ahead. We have a time.

[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.100]
4010. 40.

[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.540]
I'm just waiting. I understand you got a nine share.

[00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:31.540]
Hello. Go ahead.

[00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.500]
You can sit and treat the food and for Dave. Yeah.

[00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:38.700]
I heard from my sources that a mystery Glen Hill retain the services that

[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.540]
infamous ornithological attorney Ellis Robin.

[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:45.780]
Okay. Now it seems the Autobahn Society plays the species Glen.

[00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:49.540]
All right. We don't let's not get into any of these legalese. Okay.

[00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:51.940]
We have our reasons, but let's not get in any of that. Okay.

[00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:55.100]
I just want to know a great, very touchy and sensitive here today.

[00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.600]
Brennan, tell it up. This is place on the endangered side.

[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.020]
Okay. Have a wonderful life. Okay.

[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:04.440]
The W only has to be given an legal idea at the top of the hour.

[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.320]
The rest of the hour. You think I don't know that? Of course you know that.

[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.360]
You think I'm a total douchebag?

[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:10.040]
I think you've been in this business.

[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.780]
So this is a bored meal.

[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:14.740]
Quote, mark this.

[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:15.700]
Is it for Mark Griffin?

[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.260]
Oh, yeah. So you would happen to him.

[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.100]
Exile to a station that's not even on the air.

[00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:25.400]
Yeah. Channel six.

[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:26.780]
The signal goes straight up in the air.

[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.940]
Even a cable you can't get channels.

[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:29.580]
It's a hard day.

[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:31.480]
It's a barb to slow and I hope he's real.

[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.260]
So anyway, their colliders are WNN.

[00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:35.120]
Right.

[00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.060]
But they say you're listening.

[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:38.400]
But that's wrong.

[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:39.540]
What's wrong?

[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.260]
It's quoting here. It says you're listening to WNN.

[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:46.480]
The announcer says broadcasting the colliders of Joe Knuckles' grand experiment

[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.860]
in Pomano Beach, the world's first all-motivation radio station.

[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:50.720]
What's wrong with that?

[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:52.740]
They don't give the first W.

[00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:53.260]
Correct.

[00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:54.080]
The first W.

[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.140]
The first W.

[00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.900]
Is that what you're talking about?

[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.880]
We've just discovered a coagul now.

[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:03.340]
Bird has a coagul.

[00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.460]
You and Donald would work real well to get that letter.

[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:07.640]

[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:08.620]
Rub your coaguls together.

[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.820]
You know that letter right before X and the alphabet.

[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.680]
They don't give the first one.

[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:13.920]
Is that what you're talking about?

[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.460]
Is that what you're...

[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:15.660]
Yes.

[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.200]
What's wrong with that?

[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:19.860]
There's a station in Pom Beach.

[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:21.140]
They call it KGR.

[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.760]
It's WKGR.

[00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.720]
They only give the full colliders at the top of the hour.

[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:26.880]
Now I must be on the West Coast.

[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.420]
Pom Springs maybe KGR.

[00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:30.180]
No. It's in Pom Beach.

[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:32.740]
Pom Springs.

[00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:33.180]
Yeah.

[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.640]
There's nothing wrong with that.

[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.700]
So in other words, like everything is in a shorthand now, right?

[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:39.680]
We've got INZ.

[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:39.860]
We've got INZ.

[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:40.060]

[00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:41.520]
We've got INZ.

[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.660]
We've got INZ.

[00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:44.080]
That's OK.

[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:44.520]
Yeah.

[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:45.960]
I don't like that.

[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:46.860]
It's OK.

[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.140]
See if it was any other letter.

[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:50.460]
But when there's another W missing, then you've got a problem.

[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:50.980]
Why?

[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.340]
They got plenty of them in the call.

[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.240]
They can do that.

[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:56.580]
They're one.

[00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:57.020]

[00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.460]
Motivational radio.

[00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:00.620]
That's probably the Veele Rogers factors.

[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:01.660]
What the...

[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:01.900]
Oh.

[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:02.600]
...to do that.

[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:03.240]
Absolutely.

[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.320]
The Veele Palm factor.

[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:04.580]

[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.140]
Now we got to it.

[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:06.440]
OK.

[00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:06.900]
Take a minute.

[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:09.820]
OK.

[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.800]
Let's go back to some calls.

[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:13.040]
Let's do it a-broward.

[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:13.260]
Hello.

[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:14.080]
Hi.

[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:14.600]
Hi.

[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:15.280]
Neil.

[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:15.960]
What's up?

[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.640]
What does Jeff Gray look like?

[00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:19.340]
Who?

[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.180]
Jeff Gray, the guy that reads your news.

[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:22.220]
Jeff Gray.

[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:23.220]
Jeff Gray.

[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.400]
You don't know who Jeff Gray is?

[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:28.180]
He works for you.

[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:29.020]
No, how about with you?

[00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:30.600]
Sir, slow down a little bit.

[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.000]
How about Jeff Gray with a B?

[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:33.880]
Oh, is it B?

[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.720]
B as in Boyish.

[00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:36.520]
Oh, really?

[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:37.800]
G as in Boyish.

[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:40.640]
No, I thought it was G.

[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:42.020]
I guess I didn't hear him.

[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:42.460]
It's a B.

[00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:44.080]
Well, you know, when you're laughing at much,

[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.380]
it's hard to pick up the name, you know.

[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:46.340]
It's got a sexy voice.

[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.800]
Jeff Gray has a sexy voice.

[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:50.880]
I thought so.

[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:51.400]
What is he?

[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.440]
What do you look like?

[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:53.420]
Forget it, sir.

[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:53.920]
Really?

[00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:54.720]
He's a nice guy.

[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.980]
Very nice guy, but he's not your type.

[00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:57.700]
Oh, really?

[00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:59.460]
Now, what are we doing now?

[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:00.600]
We're going to start like a...

[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.480]
The counterpart of the Arlene Ross voice obsession?

[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.380]
For desperate queens, is that what we're doing now?

[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.120]
Come on now.

[00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.540]
Come on, you can do better than that.

[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.700]
I watched Channel 7 News this morning,

[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:15.580]
and they had Pat Robertson's reply to all those hot clues yesterday.

[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:16.080]
Yeah.

[00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:18.360]
He said apparently he wasn't worried about it,

[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.000]
because apparently they were just a bunch of un-page,

[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:20.840]
chaotic Americans.

[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:21.500]
Yeah.

[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:25.540]
Probably a bunch of militant black homo-septice.

[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:26.600]
Yeah.

[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.660]
I was reading an magazine where he says that he gets elected,

[00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:31.120]
which is a joke, but if he gets elected...

[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:32.680]
I got news for it.

[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:33.280]
It's not a joke.

[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:35.120]
I mean, the Fishing Elected is very important.

[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:35.180]
I know that's a very important part.

[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:39.480]
There are going to be a lot of us who are going to be swimming up over to Cuba or somewhere anywhere.

[00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:40.520]
Anywhere we can get to.

[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.540]
He says that if he gets elected, his cabinet is going to be made up of nothing,

[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:44.620]
but born again Christians,

[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.760]
because they're the only ones that are morally capable of running this country.

[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:48.160]
Yeah.

[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:48.940]
Isn't that right?

[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.740]
And he was holding up his clasp barbie doll while he was cutting his feet, yeah.

[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.780]
Who's this e-clay, Shaw?

[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:57.200]
I just got this junk mail in my mail box.

[00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:59.020]
He's your representative, sir.

[00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:01.180]
He's your congressman from Broward County.

[00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:02.000]
No, I just moved in.

[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.360]
And God help you, sir.

[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.640]
I would move out right now.

[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.120]
No, he just sent me this letter about AIDS.

[00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:11.520]
He says, President Reagan has announced that our nation needs an all-out campaign to stop AIDS.

[00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:12.400]
I agree completely.

[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:13.580]
That's kind of a joke, too.

[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:13.880]
Yeah.

[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:17.420]
Many go down to say all of us will have to stress abstinence for our children

[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:20.400]
and teach them that sexual experimentation can have dire consequences.

[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:21.520]
I don't know what you're upset about.

[00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:23.900]
The president is a budgeted $80 this year.

[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:25.760]
What are you upset about?

[00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:28.720]
I thought it was $90.

[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:29.280]
No, $80.

[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:30.160]
They had a little cutbacks.

[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:30.980]
You didn't tell her right.

[00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.360]
Hey, what's the, what's the hitcher about?

[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.700]
I, I, I, it, listen.

[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.080]
Now you would love the hitcher.

[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.820]
I'm telling you for many reasons, but I can just tell by the general

[00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:40.820]
the pattern of your, you know,

[00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:41.800]
I've heard you talk about it.

[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.600]
Of your limperisted dialogue I can tell that you would, well, first,

[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:45.900]
you know who Tom Howell is?

[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:46.680]
Yeah.

[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:47.280]
Yeah.

[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.400]
Oh, listen to the enthusiasm there, right?

[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:50.240]
And Rucker Howard.

[00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:51.200]
And Rucker Howard.

[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:52.060]
No, Wednesday night.

[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:54.700]
I saw like the first 15 minutes of the hitcher.

[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:54.980]
Yeah.

[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.200]
And I saw a Rucker Howard in this.

[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.940]
And why did you turn it off?

[00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.120]
Because I slept.

[00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:00.020]
I was tired.

[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:00.900]
I got home from work.

[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:01.980]
Don't you have a VCR?

[00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:03.300]
Yeah, but I didn't think.

[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.960]
I didn't think everybody in America had a VCR.

[00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:05.720]
You should.

[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.240]
Yeah, but you're like my roommate, you know, you sit down and you watch a movie

[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.420]
and you just, oh, let's tape this in the movie halfway over.

[00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:12.460]
I don't like to tape something unless I get the first product.

[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:13.460]
Can I ask you a question?

[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:13.780]
Why?

[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.340]
I know that probably your house is being watched, but you get, you get like

[00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:20.460]
comic magazines like TV Guide.

[00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:20.960]
Right.

[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:22.460]
You know, or the cable guide.

[00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:25.320]
I mean, you know, one of those does it split into your mailbox every once in a while?

[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:26.340]
It's been a while, yeah.

[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.600]
So like, if you see that it's coming, I mean, the hitcher's on like every night practically

[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.720]
because it's a popular.

[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.480]
It's like a, it's got a cult following.

[00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:32.820]
Yeah.

[00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:34.900]
And just see when it's coming on and tape it.

[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.500]
I'm telling you, you'll love the hitcher.

[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:37.920]
It's just great.

[00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:41.340]
The last part where I saw what he was telling this cute kid to say,

[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.100]
I want to die in the kid's worstima of the car.

[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:44.680]
What do you mean this cute kid?

[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.720]
That's Tom Howell.

[00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:47.080]
I know.

[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:51.760]
Do you look at everything in terms of, I mean, you know, body parts and sex

[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.660]
and like I do, I mean, the caravan.

[00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.660]
Shame on you, sir.

[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.700]
Except for the Godfather.

[00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:58.300]
I watched that last night.

[00:20:58.420 --> 00:20:59.060]
That wasn't too sexy.

[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.760]
Okay, now there was nobody sexy in the Godfather, but it's not for us.

[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:05.340]
But aren't you become obsessed with that movie?

[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:05.940]
Oh, yeah.

[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.060]
Yeah, that's a four time.

[00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:07.660]
I've seen it.

[00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:09.280]
Oh, I've seen it probably 50 times.

[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.400]
And I still can't get enough.

[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:11.940]
I think Godfather Tuesday's on tonight.

[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:12.520]
Yeah.

[00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:13.840]
Yeah, that's pretty exciting.

[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:14.940]
But that's with Amarlin Brand.

[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.420]
Well, feel the nice talk to you.

[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.040]
Trust me.

[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:19.780]
Trust me.

[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:20.580]
Watch the hitcher.

[00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:21.040]
Okay.

[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.800]
And when you see it, let me know how you like it.

[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:24.020]
Okay.

[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:24.500]
Okay.

[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:25.240]
I'll read the picture.

[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:25.460]
Okay.

[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:26.720]
Two, four, six, eight.

[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:27.400]
A little help.

[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:28.180]
Who do we appreciate?

[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:29.160]
He doesn't need a little help.

[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.380]
He just needs a little encouragement.

[00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:30.720]
Yeah.

[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:31.860]
Little guidance.

[00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:32.420]
Right.

[00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:33.380]
Like TV guidance.

[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.160]
Yeah, that would help.

[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:36.060]
That's a good start.

[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:38.360]
22 before lunch at Wions.

[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.540]
The lunch is coming in at noon.

[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:44.780]
Or there are bounds being brought to us by some Italian restaurant.

[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:45.680]
Can you believe that guy?

[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.320]
I'm still burning over that guy who said, you know, where?

[00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.440]
What are your favorite restaurants when you pay?

[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:50.920]
Yeah.

[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:55.500]
I think he's confusing me with an egotistical moron who's on in the afternoon on another station.

[00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:56.260]
Obviously.

[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.240]
Mr. Parmesan.

[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:01.720]
Dave County.

[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:02.020]
Hello.

[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:03.640]
Yes, it's just that.

[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:04.080]
Are you okay?

[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:04.800]
I can eat.

[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:06.860]
You know who that is, don't you?

[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:07.440]
Mm.

[00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:08.120]
I sure do.

[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:09.020]
Hello.

[00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:10.980]
I think I know what that music is.

[00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:13.720]
It's a cross between my sweet lord and she's so fun.

[00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:14.420]
Exactly.

[00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:16.480]
The chiffons I would recognize them anywhere.

[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:16.800]
Wait a minute.

[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:17.340]
One more time.

[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:18.700]
Oh, yeah.

[00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:20.040]
No question about it.

[00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:23.200]
It's more Paris than swiping the honeymoon as music.

[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.600]
No, I think it was one to find Dave by the chiffons.

[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:26.400]
That was the other one.

[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:26.700]
All right.

[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.460]
We're all so soon up.

[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:28.160]
Right?

[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:28.740]
Yeah.

[00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:30.360]
One, three, twelve, fourteen.

[00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:31.180]
I'll read the urge.

[00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:32.020]
Okay.

[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:37.720]
By the way, Joey's going to be doing an anti-Semitic jokes Monday morning.

[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.760]
So those of you who enjoy that kind of bigotry, I'm sure you'll love it.

[00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:42.040]
Covered in this town real well.

[00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:42.300]
Yeah.

[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.280]
How come they named Joe Robbie Stadium after Joe?

[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:47.360]
I don't know.

[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.400]
I'm going to have to ask somebody that.

[00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:50.440]
Let's ask Don Shula.

[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.580]
Do you remember Don Shula?

[00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:55.200]
Well, I don't know if Joey does, but I do.

[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:55.620]
Do you?

[00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:58.760]
And Danny Moreno?

[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.960]
I must confess one thing.

[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.780]
I shouldn't admit this, but I'm kind of curious.

[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:10.420]
I may even watch more football this weekend than I would have watched if there would have been

[00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:13.280]
no strike, because I'm curious is what it's going to look like.

[00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:14.480]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:16.160]
It'll look like arena football, I think.

[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:18.080]
Carl has an immediate.

[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.160]
The USFF.

[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.000]
The useless football.

[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:21.220]
Yeah.

[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.280]
Sort of like arena football.

[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:22.740]
Yeah.

[00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:24.500]
Oh, that's a level.

[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:25.920]
Yeah, the duck floaty won't be out there.

[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:26.620]
It won't be the same.

[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:29.200]
And Steve, while Steve Young could across the picket line.

[00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:31.400]
I like that Tony Dorset, man.

[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:32.320]
He's only making like what?

[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.400]
40 million a year.

[00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.060]
And he just can never, you know, get those bills paid.

[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:36.680]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:37.920]
It's tough.

[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:39.200]
And never patch up.

[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.680]
So he followed Danny White right across that picket line.

[00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.660]
And of course, there are a lot of us who would have followed Danny White across there too,

[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:45.660]
but not lately.

[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.340]
He's looking bad.

[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:47.820]
I'm Tony.

[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:50.180]
He's lived a very short life, Danny White.

[00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:54.860]
He looks beaten and brutalized and just horrendous.

[00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:57.480]
Sort of like me.

[00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:58.220]
Yeah.

[00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:59.420]
Very, very close.

[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:00.440]
Not that horrendous.

[00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:00.940]
That's what.

[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:02.720]
Babe County, hello.

[00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:05.900]
Let's try another one and date.

[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:06.240]
Hello.

[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:07.560]
Hi.

[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:10.640]
Hi.

[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:16.000]
I was just calling to make a comment about what you said about swimming, Cacuba.

[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:17.420]
Oh, yeah.

[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.480]
Just a joke now.

[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:20.540]
Don't get all uptight.

[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.100]
No, I won't get uptight.

[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.560]
How about the Bahamas?

[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.000]
Should I have sits swimming to the Bahamas?

[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:25.480]
No.

[00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:33.360]
I'm sincerely thinking about if Mr. Warg is nominated or any of those other jerks get into us.

[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:38.160]
If I'm sincerely going over to the passport place and getting myself a passport.

[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:38.780]
Oh, yeah.

[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.080]
I've been suggesting that for a long time.

[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:42.400]
In fact, when Reagan got elected the first time, I said you better.

[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.580]
I'm getting the heck out of here.

[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.340]
You better have a passport and keep it warm.

[00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:46.100]
Keep it in the microwave.

[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:48.140]
Definitely.

[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:49.320]
Definitely.

[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:50.300]
I will be there.

[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.420]
I'll stick around for a little while.

[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.560]
I think Bork is a dork now.

[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:56.180]
He's finished.

[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:57.380]
He's dead as a door nailer.

[00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:58.340]
I certainly hope so.

[00:24:58.460 --> 00:24:58.760]
That's good.

[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.100]
I always liked Arlen Specter.

[00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:04.000]
I knew he was creative when he came up with a single bullet theory in the Kennedy assassination.

[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.280]
I knew he had a wild imagination.

[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.580]
He's been useful.

[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:09.940]
Yeah.

[00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:12.640]
Well.

[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.060]
Don't sweat it.

[00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:14.940]
I will try now.

[00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:18.540]
I think it's time to go.

[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:22.200]
I think it's time to go.

[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:22.280]

[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:22.280]

[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:22.280]

[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:22.280]

[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:22.280]

[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:22.680]
I think it's time to go.

[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:22.680]

[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:22.840]
I think it's time to go.

[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:22.840]

[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:23.240]
I think it's time to go.

[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.040]
I think it's time to go.

[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:24.720]
I think it's time to go.

[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:25.160]
I think it's time to go.

[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.520]
I think it's time to go.

[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.800]
I think it's time to go.

[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.120]
I think it's time to go.

[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:33.980]
I think it's time to go.

[00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:36.600]
I think it's time to go.

[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:42.040]
I think it's time to go.

[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:44.920]
I think it's time to go.

[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:53.720]
I think it's time to go.

[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:56.240]
I think it's time to go.

[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:56.240]

[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:56.240]

[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:56.240]

[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:56.240]

[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:56.240]

[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:56.240]

[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:56.760]
I think it's time to go.

[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:57.380]
I think it's time to go.

[00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:58.520]
I think it's time to go.

[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.760]
I think it's time to go.

[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.900]
I think it's time to go.

[00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:03.440]
I think it's time to go.

[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.160]
I think it's time to go.

[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:05.960]
I think it's time to go.

[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:06.440]
I think it's time to go.

[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.220]
I think it's time to go.

[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.080]
I think it's time to go.

[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:12.220]
I think it's time to go.

[00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.340]
I think it's time to go.

[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:14.900]
I think it's time to go.

[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:24.240]
I think it's time to go.

I wish you just say hello.

[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:51.740]
You seem very uptight and unfriendly for the best DJ on the dial.

[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.140]
We'll see you with Pomfino starting Thursday,

[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:56.440]
sincerely Peter and it's got a name and friends.

[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:05.660]
P.S. asked for Peter and Nancy.

[00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:09.040]
Come downstairs and say hello and for goodness sake don't look down.

[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:10.260]
What does that mean?

[00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:13.780]
Am I, I don't know which tellers at the track know who I am?

[00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:16.400]
Some of them do and then friendly do them.

[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:19.120]
But when I'm especially at Calder when I'm going to the window,

[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:22.480]
sure I look unfriendly and uptight, uptight and unlucky.

[00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:23.440]
Because you are.

[00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:24.580]
You bet I'm uptight.

[00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:27.760]
I'd like to cash once this summer anyway you know.

[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:32.160]
I mean the Mike and Zalas has done great for me but 320.

[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:33.800]
How much can you cash at 320?

[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:34.720]
You don't want to say in Mike?

[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.600]
I mean let's get serious with Peter.

[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:38.540]
Who is this guy?

[00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:39.760]
He's way done to understand.

[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:41.780]
Uptight and unfriendly.

[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.480]
You knew all of the pain in the ass pain.

[00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:46.360]
No most of them are nice.

[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:47.280]
I shouldn't say that.

[00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:50.920]
That they come up to me and I'm always nice to them at the track wherever it is.

[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:52.340]
Look at it.

[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.280]
You know what's there up there the other night?

[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:57.120]
A thousand although it dwindled the 500 on Joey show.

[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:57.680]
It was just 500.

[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:58.700]
I see.

[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.820]
But well over a thousand people.

[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:02.280]
He wasn't there.

[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:03.360]
Who cares?

[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:05.640]
I didn't see anybody with a walker.

[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:09.280]
I don't think so.

[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:11.820]
By the way did you say the food that was coming is northern to Texas.

[00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:12.440]
Yes.

[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.260]
Like in Joey Pinto, northern Italian, like from Buffalo.

[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:16.400]
Yes.

[00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:21.280]
Uptight and unfriendly.

[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:24.160]
Peter if you're listening I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:30.340]
I mean when I go to the window I'm not see one thing that bothers me is when people schmooze at the window.

[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:30.620]
Right.

[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.440]
There are people online you should pardon the expression behind you.

[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:39.080]
And it bugs me if there's somebody in front of me and the teller is they're going on.

[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:44.180]
And all I think the three about the pop and all this other crap that's it's bad business.

[00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:45.060]
We have a deadline.

[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:45.880]
Right.

[00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:47.820]
I mean you got to get through bed in by the sun.

[00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:49.320]
Yeah you can't bed after the race starts.

[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:49.600]
Right.

[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.140]
You have to break the news to you.

[00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:51.860]
But you're on.

[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:55.800]
In other words you can't wait till they come to the top of the stretch and the four horses ahead by eight lengths.

[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.060]
And I say okay give me 500 to win on the four.

[00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:58.740]
Oh you're kidding.

[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:00.120]
It doesn't work that way.

[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:01.580]
Oh I mean that's your point.

[00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:02.860]
You got to get the bed in.

[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:04.600]
You know you got limited time.

[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:05.060]
Right.

[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.220]
People shouldn't smute.

[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:08.220]
Don't smuse.

[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:10.840]
Don't smuse.

[00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:12.320]
Or you lose.

[00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:14.900]
I don't smuse and I still lose.

[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:15.340]
Okay.

[00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:16.880]
I'll tighten on friendly.

[00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:17.740]
Oh gee.

[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:20.160]
I mean I appreciate all these wonderful gifts.

[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:23.240]
But like this nose clip which will come in handy.

[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:26.140]
You know or is this a big clip I guess to hold the big closed.

[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.280]
Okay let's go back to the phone.

[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.420]
I'm not going to take it personally because I'm sure that they met it in good spirit.

[00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:31.660]
Right.

[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:33.340]
And I have a rob's little note.

[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:37.480]
Now see I this to me indicates a young man who is secure.

[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.940]
And if you look like him you'd be secured too.

[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:43.700]
And you know he doesn't he just knows it's a radio show.

[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.880]
And nobody molests him when we go in there to shop.

[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:46.400]
Mm-hmm.

[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:50.200]
May think about it but like I said looking is great.

[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:51.280]
Right.

[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:53.480]
And he understands that he's not uptight.

[00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:57.720]
And not one of these nervous nelly so to speak.

[00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:58.200]
Good.

[00:31:58.860 --> 00:31:59.160]
Good.

[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.300]
Dave County hello.

[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.900]
Are you guys doing okay?

[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:09.840]
Listen I want to let you guys know that guy who came in and jumped all over Hank.

[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:20.240]
Hank deal the day with him in the air and said that he dedicated that I 95 song team Mr. Cran for good.

[00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:24.560]
You know for what he was doing with this SST thing.

[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:25.500]
Good for Hank.

[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:26.380]
Wow I wouldn't know.

[00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:29.000]
If anybody over there had the balls to tell it like it is.

[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:29.420]
That's right.

[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:30.920]
Get off Hank's case.

[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:31.460]
Good.

[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.000]
Hank did take a stand.

[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:33.960]
I'm not on Hank's case.

[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:34.600]
I like Hank.

[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:35.000]
He's a good one.

[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.500]
Oh I know but that other guy did.

[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:36.840]
Yeah.

[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:46.420]
And I wanted to find out from the bird that he's gotten over his little problem from the other day when that guy Dave came in.

[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:47.360]
He's all over that now.

[00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:50.040]
And he's making a slow recovery.

[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:54.660]
I thought he might have had his feeling for it nearly and that's probably why he left.

[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:56.320]
But he seems to be doing okay.

[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.000]
Listen now that Kyle's leaving.

[00:32:58.180 --> 00:32:59.080]
I need a job.

[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:00.180]
I'm unemployed.

[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:03.080]
I can do the job Kyle was doing.

[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:03.840]
No chance.

[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:07.860]
Are we bringing the replacement straight out of the psychiatric ward at Jackson.

[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.320]
So I'm afraid no chance.

[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:10.380]
Oh that's terrible.

[00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:12.860]
All right well you guys have a good weekend.

[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:13.860]
Good luck to you.

[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:14.800]
Enjoy yourself tonight.

[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:15.520]
Okay.

[00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:17.320]
And keep up the good work.

[00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:17.860]
Good luck.

[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:19.000]
And tell Joey to pick out.

[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:19.600]
Okay.

[00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:20.000]
All right.

[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:20.720]
I'll read the dirge.

[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.800]
Yeah we know Bob Roland is going to be sitting up there between 10 and 10.

[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.180]
We hope he has a wonderful time.

[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:28.260]
Okay let's go to Broward.

[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:28.560]
Hello.

[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:30.240]
Yes sir.

[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.740]
Bill from yesterday you want to call sweet blue baby.

[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:36.080]
Bill from yesterday is still well listen hold on a second now.

[00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:37.040]
Never give up.

[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:38.180]
Never give up.

[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.420]
He waited 25 hours.

[00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:43.480]
Well we can talk to sweet blue and see if the earth moved toward her.

[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:45.960]
Bill I am so horny there isn't a light socket.

[00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:47.480]
There's one.

[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.960]
There isn't a light socket in this room that's safe.

[00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:58.720]
Obviously he has a little candle lobby up there you know how small those bulbs are.

[00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:00.180]
Out and in my hand.

[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:01.400]
Please.

[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:02.100]
Who?

[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.960]
Don't say these disgusting things sir.

[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.880]
Just say they're blue.

[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:13.160]
Well the lines you got to be back you think so?

[00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:14.660]
In LA today they had a ring.

[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:16.160]
Oh it's ringing.

[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:17.260]
It's ringing.

[00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:18.280]
You know they had a tough day.

[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:19.600]
They were there they had a bad day.

[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:23.420]
Sweet blue.

[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.680]
I don't like the earthquake's point.

[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:27.100]
Oh how's by you?

[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:34.060]
Well it's ringing like I said but they may be all shook up.

[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:36.180]
I go with you with just a month.

[00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:40.640]
This is what talks about unlimited time and you have a credit card.

[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:41.280]
Yeah call me.

[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:43.620]
Give me your visa card number 45789.

[00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:43.840]
Oh.

[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:44.460]

[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:46.400]
Yeah give me your visa card number.

[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.800]
Calm down Bill relax.

[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:50.740]
Just get a hold of yourself.

[00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:53.100]
I've got a ramrod ready to percolate.

[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:57.240]
This guy just watch yourself will you please this is a radio show.

[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.440]
I'm not using any of the seven doors.

[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:02.780]
No you're making up new ones as you go along.

[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:04.500]
That's easy isn't going to get on you.

[00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:05.060]
Yeah right.

[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.640]
They're going to be knocking on your door any minute.

[00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:09.200]
Gilbertson is in on the list of money.

[00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:10.180]
No Gilbertson.

[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.080]
Don't start with him will you please?

[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:14.600]
That all these programming experts out there.

[00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:19.140]
I think you could be out of luck we only got about a minute.

[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:20.940]
A minute and forty seconds.

[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:26.700]
I pray is getting ready with the news okay he's already he already acquired a boyfriend before you this morning.

[00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:27.600]
He doesn't need another one.

[00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:30.960]
His wife's on a way to divorce court right now.

[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:33.840]
Poor guy.

[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:35.160]
If you don't speak nice to him,

[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.560]
Stale will be upset because he'll never bring his daughter in here again.

[00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:43.680]
I think your SOL is they saying the trade sir.

[00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:45.720]
I don't think we're going to hear anybody.

[00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:47.340]
I think we have a little problem over there.

[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:48.640]
The study right now.

[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:55.360]
Probably is a matter of fact the problem is that all the people who couldn't get through to L.A. yesterday are underlined today and all the girls are tied up.

[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:56.240]
Okay.

[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:57.160]
Don't you think so?

[00:35:58.340 --> 00:35:59.220]
Yeah that's a theory.

[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.420]
I don't know what I'm going to do now.

[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:04.940]
Well I have a suggestion but we won't mention it on the air especially during the lunch hours.

[00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:06.200]
Michael Jackson glove.

[00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:06.560]
Right.

[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:07.560]
I think that's it.

[00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:08.300]
Okay Neil.

[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:09.860]
Well we tried for you.

[00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:10.720]
Thanks anyway.

[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:11.640]
We'll try it again tomorrow.

[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:12.260]
All right.

[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:13.100]
On Yom Kipper.

[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:13.800]
Okay.

[00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:14.860]
Okay good luck to you.

[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:15.900]
We can't do it on Yom Kipper.

[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.980]
We'll never be able to do it.

[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:18.740]
But wait a minute.

[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:20.560]
I think we caught him in an inappropriate moment.

[00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:26.380]
Okay well evidently some bird sounds coming out now.

[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:30.340]
You notice who's not in the room at the moment so maybe there's a little something going on we don't know about.

[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:31.260]
Dave County.

[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:31.600]
Hello.

[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:32.320]
Emma?

[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:33.660]
Oh yeah.

[00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:34.120]
Emma?

[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:34.760]
Emma?

[00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:35.860]
How about Emma's?

[00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:38.240]
What is it with Emma all of a sudden?

[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:41.920]
You know after all this time we've got this Reverend Emma syndrome starting again Reverend

[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:42.320]
Enema.

[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:44.560]
Get serious already.

[00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:45.980]
Will you please give it a break?

[00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:47.700]
Great job again.

[00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:48.900]
Are you still there?

[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:50.120]
Oh, P.W.

[00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:51.400]
Okay let's.

[00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:58.060]
Let's go to a Broward next.

[00:36:58.380 --> 00:36:58.480]
Hello.

[00:36:59.360 --> 00:36:59.980]
Is this Neil?

[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:00.920]
It sure is.

[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:01.980]
Neil?

[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:02.520]
Yes.

[00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:04.280]
This is a good listener of yours.

[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:04.720]
Great.

[00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:07.280]
I was introduced to you by my dad.

[00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:08.000]
Yes.

[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:11.620]
And well today's his birthday I was wondering if you could do me a flavor.

[00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:12.560]
What is that?

[00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:13.300]
It's not strawberry.

[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:14.860]
It's what?

[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:16.500]
It's not strawberry.

[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:21.080]
What is that supposed to mean?

[00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:22.100]
Am I missing something?

[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:23.860]
Our favorite ice cream flavor is strawberry?

[00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:24.560]
Yeah.

[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.100]
I asked you if you could do me a flavor.

[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:28.500]
Okay I got it.

[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:30.580]
Little late right?

[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:31.540]
Little cute humor.

[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:31.780]
Yeah.

[00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:32.880]
Very little.

[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:34.660]
Well anyway today's his birthday.

[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:35.140]
Yes.

[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:35.920]
I think he did that.

[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:36.320]
Yeah.

[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:36.760]
And he's what?

[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:39.920]
He's 50 years old.

[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:40.500]
Okay.

[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:42.120]
And what's the flavor?

[00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:43.100]
Strawberry.

[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:51.300]
Well the reason why I'm calling Neil is I'm working now but I don't have my priorities

[00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:51.800]
screwed up.

[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.180]
I listen to you every day.

[00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:00.180]
I feel like I'm celebrating you on Kipper two days early.

[00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:03.360]
What is it that you wanted though?

[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.700]
I mean you wanted something and you just don't seem to want to spit it out or is it just

[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.660]
or you're just calling to be friendly?

[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:10.840]
No I enjoy your show.

[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:11.320]
Good.

[00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:14.500]
And I wanted you to do a flavor for me.

[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.560]
What is it already?

[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:16.300]
What is it?

[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:18.720]
I'll be your flavor in your brain in a minute.

[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:19.460]
What is it?

[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:20.740]
What do you want?

[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:23.760]
Would you play that song that make a song that you play?

[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:24.880]
Make up.

[00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:25.580]
Yeah.

[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.140]
I forget who sings it now.

[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.220]
No we don't play make up.

[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.880]
That's an old no girl routine.

[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:31.140]
What?

[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:35.680]
Putting on the make up.

[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:37.360]
Putting on the make up.

[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:48.000]
It's 115 at WINZ and let's go back to Dave County.

[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:48.420]
Hello.

[00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:49.160]
Yes.

[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:50.700]
Did you understand that?

[00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:52.820]
Um okay.

[00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:54.900]
Did you understand the last call?

[00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:59.700]
Uh he was, that was a lady and yeah I, yeah okay.

[00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:00.340]
Siddly out of it.

[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:00.960]
That's it okay.

[00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:02.020]
What can we do for you sir?

[00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:02.480]
Okay.

[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:04.520]
My name is Don and I'm from Princeton.

[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:05.940]
From Princeton, New Jersey.

[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:06.420]
Yeah.

[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:06.780]
No.

[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:07.640]
Princeton, Florida.

[00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:09.280]
I know where Coli's square is.

[00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:09.840]
I see that.

[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:10.040]
So.

[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:11.420]
A Princeton, Florida okay.

[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:12.040]
I know where that is.

[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:12.820]
Right down the road.

[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:13.300]
Yeah.

[00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:14.060]
Okay.

[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:16.440]
Is Glenn there?

[00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:18.460]
No he's, I have no idea what happened.

[00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:22.260]
And he just wanders out with no explanation and just runs around a building.

[00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:25.280]
He's probably eating, uh, you know, three or four lunches.

[00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:26.820]
I really liked that.

[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:27.820]
Well good.

[00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:30.720]
At first when he came on a program, I didn't care for him.

[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:33.240]
No, but he grows on you, you know, like a Malik Nathoum or right?

[00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:33.920]
Terrific.

[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:35.080]
Anyhow, I like furt.

[00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:37.460]
Um, I mean, how does he can carry a gun?

[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:39.560]
Do you want to join the pistol club?

[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:40.420]
No thanks.

[00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:40.960]
No.

[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:41.420]
No.

[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:42.400]
No, what do we do?

[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:43.920]
What is answer?

[00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:45.720]
We drink till 12 and pistol two.

[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:50.920]
Well, I'm telling you, you're almost as good as the last caller, but not quite.

[00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:54.100]
Boy, oh boy, what happens all of a sudden here?

[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.580]
Is it getting close to that time again?

[00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:57.480]
Let's be getting close to two o'clock.

[00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:59.600]
It was last seen staring at the mong machine.

[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:00.840]
Good.

[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:03.700]
I wonder if they have any of those Vio Parmes sandwiches in there.

[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:04.360]
They really do.

[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:06.000]
They really do in that little machine.

[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:07.140]
Those will really do it for you.

[00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:08.800]
It'll grow here on your inner.

[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:11.780]
Oh, banana and my flavor.

[00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.420]
Okay, let's go on to, uh, Broward.

[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:14.660]
Hello.

[00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:17.180]
Oh, you just keep that guy in the phone forever.

[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:18.200]
What?

[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:19.640]
Oh, see Thomas.

[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:22.680]
Oh, see Thomas.

[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:23.200]
Wait a minute.

[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:23.680]
Hold on.

[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:25.340]
Let's get those two lines on here together.

[00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:25.900]
Can we do that?

[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:28.080]
Um, 94.

[00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:29.640]
Oh, Rob, banana.

[00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:31.280]
Broward, banana.

[00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:33.180]
Oh, banana.

[00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:34.040]
Jason.

[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:35.920]
Jason, why are you?

[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:38.680]
Oh, it comes right here.

[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:40.680]
I'm looking at the eyes.

[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:43.300]
I can't believe I'm the moon of a room.

[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:45.740]
Oh, see.

[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:47.040]
Oh, no.

[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:48.800]
Oh, no.

[00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:52.120]
I'm not finding anything worth the ball.

[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:55.520]
I'll try to do my banana for your strawberry.

[00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:57.440]
Look, I'm here, baby.

[00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:00.540]
Oh, take care of me.

[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:02.300]
Oh, this is incredible.

[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:05.560]
Oh, you bring my stuff off, Rucker.

[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:09.380]
Oh, uh, uh, uh.

[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:11.220]
Oh, I can't take it.

[00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:13.100]
Oh, uh, uh, uh.

[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:15.660]
He's always out.

[00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:17.880]
He's never been so fierce.

[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:18.900]
I'm going right.

[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:21.680]
I will go out.

[00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:23.000]
I will find it.

[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:23.920]
I'll find it.

[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:25.620]
I'll call it.

[00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:29.220]
I like locked-handed.

[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.180]
The colas.

[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:31.720]
Yeah.

[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:34.580]
The colas, which is, well, you know, depends on what level you're talking about.

[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:35.540]
The colas is great.

[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:36.960]
Yeah.

[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:37.960]
Is it Hollywood?

[00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:39.380]
No, it's in PepperCon.

[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:39.760]
PepperCon.

[00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:42.760]
I like Frascades up in Tamarang.

[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:43.820]
What about Miami?

[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:48.520]
Studio.

[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:49.480]
Studio?

[00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:50.000]
Yeah.

[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:50.800]
That's real good.

[00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:51.620]
Did we go to JJ?

[00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:52.940]
No.

[00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:53.940]
You should.

[00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:55.380]
Terrific.

[00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:58.240]
Miami has some cut, that many good restaurants when you come right down to it.

[00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:00.840]
Ah, well, for the dozen.

[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:04.400]
I mean, unless you're talking about Cafe Show Wrong, and that kind of,

[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:06.260]
I'm not talking about on that level.

[00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:10.760]
JJ is probably one of the best, yummy restaurants in the city.

[00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:12.060]
Oh, that's what you're looking for.

[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:12.420]
Oh, yeah.

[00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:13.960]
So just for you to get your body right.

[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:15.300]
And the food is next one.

[00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:19.060]
And what we say about what, when I pay for my own meal,

[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:21.560]
you know, was that a little shot that I'd proceed there at the beginning?

[00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:22.420]
Of course.

[00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:24.000]
I thought all of these people invited you.

[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:25.280]
I got news for you.

[00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:29.860]
One of the reasons I don't go back to a lot of places is because I'm not a snore, okay?

[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:30.480]
And I've mentioned that.

[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:31.820]
I don't know how many times I've mentioned that.

[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:32.260]
I don't like previews.

[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:34.400]
I'm saying love's previews.

[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:35.180]
I don't like previews.

[00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:35.840]
I'm a snore.

[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:37.120]
Snore.

[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:37.840]
Snore.

[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:39.840]
Well, you didn't ask to invite a man.

[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:40.460]
How did I end you?

[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:41.200]
Who's that?

[00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:43.420]
Isn't the milk and cotton bite you?

[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.600]
I have every intention of paying.

[00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:49.340]
If they don't charge me, I can't impose it upon them.

[00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:53.960]
There are some restaurants that are sponsored where sometimes they pick up the checks, sometimes they don't.

[00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:55.800]
I just assume pay for it every time.

[00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:58.040]
I'm not starving to death.

[00:42:58.140 --> 00:42:59.320]
Does it look like I'm missing any meal?

[00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:00.660]
No, not at all.

[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:02.180]
You still go to Mr. Lee?

[00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:03.660]
Every once in a while.

[00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:04.480]
Yeah, that's a good restaurant.

[00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:05.080]
Good Chinese.

[00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:07.000]
There are a lot.

[00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:07.860]
I'll be honest with you.

[00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:09.060]
I said this to Stan last night.

[00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:12.320]
If I had 100 bucks for every bad restaurant and date and brow it, I could be tired.

[00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:13.320]
That's true.

[00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:14.340]
No problem at all.

[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:14.720]
That's true.

[00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:15.540]
Do you like Joe's?

[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:16.980]
I've never been there.

[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:18.560]
I'm not in the seafood.

[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:20.240]
So, you know, I hear their states are good.

[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:21.020]
But I have other things.

[00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:23.340]
I'm not going to go over there and stand online for a stone friend.

[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:24.200]
I don't like them.

[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:24.780]
It's fabulous.

[00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:26.160]
Is it really?

[00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:26.440]
Yeah.

[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:28.800]
I hope it's better than the forage.

[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:29.140]
Yeah.

[00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:32.100]
For the forage, every time Malda came back and said,

[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:33.200]
Hey, on the food has gone down.

[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:33.480]
Kill.

[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:33.880]
All right.

[00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:35.500]
I have a little story that's the, wait a minute.

[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:36.740]
Where's that paid by the way?

[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:37.740]
Aren't you going to share that with us?

[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:41.000]
A little story that MoTex has handed me from UPI.

[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:45.540]
A man was killed in Davenport, Iowa when he demanded ketchup on his French fries.

[00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:49.320]
Police police say Joe Jones was sent.

[00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:50.980]
This is a true story now, sir.

[00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:51.500]
Come on.

[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:53.980]
Oh, my God.

[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.500]
Police say Joe's now he's carrying guns and the restaurant.

[00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:57.700]
Sir, come down.

[00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:04.800]
Police say Joe Jones was stabbed after becoming in a rage that there was no ketchup to go on to potatoes as real friend of just pride.

[00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:08.540]
According to authorities, Jones attacked Tony Hinton and police say,

[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:13.180]
Week for a kitchen knife and stabbed him, she's been charged with voluntary manslaughter.

[00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:15.400]
Oh, my God.

[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:16.800]
Oh, my God.

[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.020]
Oh, my God.

[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:20.400]
Oh, my God.

[00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:22.180]
More than the rent.

[00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:23.880]
I'm trying to stop Miami close to Sam and Charles.

[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:25.300]
We're a lot of the University of Miami.

[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:26.060]
Yeah, I know where that is.

[00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:26.740]
All right.

[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:28.440]
Oh, it's not.

[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:29.360]
It is all the same.

[00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:30.420]
Another restaurant I like.

[00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:31.220]
What?

[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:32.180]
Marshall majors.

[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:33.780]
That's what I was saying.

[00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:35.020]
Oh, here, listen to this stuff.

[00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:36.840]
Get the honesty serious about that.

[00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:38.200]
I am being honest and serious.

[00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:39.140]
We're having a dinner in here, is that?

[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:39.580]
What?

[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:41.200]
You haven't been there in years?

[00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:42.180]
That's not true.

[00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:44.840]
Sir, will you calm down a little bit?

[00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:48.780]
Would you calm down a little bit before you start slandering anybody on the show?

[00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:50.680]
I like Marshall majors.

[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:51.640]
I love there.

[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:52.880]
I love the way they bring it.

[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.280]
That big bowl of mots of ball soup and they pour the soup over the mots of balls in the noodles.

[00:44:58.280 --> 00:44:59.740]
I've never had a bad meal there.

[00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:01.560]
When the last thing you were there.

[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:02.660]
Oh, three or four months ago.

[00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:05.080]
So they're all the time when I'm in that neck of the woods?

[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:05.520]
Will.

[00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:09.260]
Well, you've seen that you probably like the Rascal house, you know?

[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:11.120]
I don't travel for food.

[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:11.840]
It's not that good.

[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:16.080]
Well, listen, I know this great place where they got french fries that will knock your socks off.

[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:16.360]
Where?

[00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:17.960]
They don't have any ketchup, though.

[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:18.980]
I'll bring my own.

[00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:19.260]
Where?

[00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:20.680]
I'm interested in jokes.

[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:21.880]
I'm interested in jokes.

[00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:22.420]
I'm interested in jokes.

[00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:23.220]
Okay, have a wonderful day.

[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:23.600]
You're there.

[00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:23.960]
Okay.

[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:25.240]
Oh, you were just.

[00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:27.240]
The top is right.

[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:29.960]
What was the big deal with Marshall majors?

[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:31.480]
I like Marshall majors too.

[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:32.260]
They're delicious, yeah.

[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:35.260]
I thought they got a great stuffed cabbage.

[00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:36.200]
You like stuffed cabbage?

[00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:36.880]
Yeah, sure.

[00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:40.020]
And what are some of the other things that I like?

[00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:40.720]
They've got fishkey.

[00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:43.660]
I'm not going to tell you who had the best fishkey, which you're an expert, of course, on that.

[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:44.560]
You don't even know what it is.

[00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:46.360]
The type two was up there.

[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:47.840]
The place that closed up in the gallery.

[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:49.740]
Oh, the gallery.

[00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:51.580]
Yeah.

[00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:54.000]
The deli that closed up from New York.

[00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:56.600]
That's the closest.

[00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:57.620]
Goye, shut the car.

[00:45:58.980 --> 00:45:59.960]
You know the one I'm talking about.

[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:00.800]
The Carnegie.

[00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:01.460]
Thank you, Tom.

[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:02.040]
Oh, yeah.

[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:04.080]
What am I going to do after Saturday?

[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:05.000]
Oh, boy.

[00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:08.200]
When Kyle was working, Kyle would just have to hang around for four hours.

[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:08.920]
He won't answer the phone.

[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:10.260]
He just put messages on his shirt.

[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:11.460]
That's a good idea.

[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:14.100]
For another dollar an hour, you know.

[00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:17.820]
But I think when it's great to keep him on, you know, you know, I'm going to tell you

[00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:33.360]
that you're going to have a good time.

[00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:41.100]
I'm going to tell you that you're going to have a good time.

[00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:41.100]

[00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:41.100]

[00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:41.100]

[00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:41.100]

[00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:41.120]
I'm going to tell you that you're going to have a good time.

[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:42.620]
I'm going to tell you that you're going to have a good time.

[00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:43.240]
I'm going to tell you that you're going to have a good time.

[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:44.860]
I'm going to tell you that you're going to have a good time.

[00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:46.840]
I'm going to tell you that you're going to have a good time.

[00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:47.800]
I'm going to tell you that you're going to have a good time.

[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:50.200]
You could begin imploning for your sins right now and still.
