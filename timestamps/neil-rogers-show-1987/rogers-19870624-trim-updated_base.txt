[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580]
Male because we do generate a lot of male and we put out a lot of male and

[00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.460]
Rick did as many many favors. Whatever I ask him, he never said no to me, Neil.

[00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:18.940]
He always did it and he did it with a good attitude. A smile on his face, a great

[00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.080]
kid and he was tragically killed at an automobile accident last night and

[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.560]
everyone here in the building is feeling a definite feeling of loss this morning.

[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:38.920]
We certainly will miss him very much. Rick Sampson who sort of did a lot of

[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.420]
everything we needed. Whatever we needed he would do.

[00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.320]
Yeah, we sent along our sympathy to his family and do all of his friends and

[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.240]
as you said we'll miss him around here. Anyway we got so many things to talk

[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.580]
about and some of them are pretty depressing too including these morons with

[00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.440]
their pit bulls. I know some other people have been talking about that and I've

[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.580]
we've done a lot of shows on that. In fact the radio talk shows it on so many

[00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.460]
programs on pit bulls over the years. It's become another one of those tried

[00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.180]
and true topics and the sad part of it is that they don't do anything about it.

[00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.980]
That's the pathetic part and I was appalled last night on CNN. I was on, I'm

[00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.700]
sorry, it was on CBS on the Channel 4 News at 11 o'clock and they showed the

[00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.160]
footage from the I guess it's K and X T in Los Angeles. With this crazy woman

[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.080]
out there I mean you talk about a redneck she's the definitive pit bull owner.

[00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.680]
This big grotesque pathetic woman and it wasn't bad enough that the first guy

[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.220]
got mulled but then when the woman from animal control went out there they

[00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.640]
showed the footage they showed the tape and they showed the dog you know she was

[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.400]
threatening her and well you better get out of here or the dog's gonna get out

[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.480]
again and sure enough she just opened the door far enough and the dog ran out

[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.720]
and attacked this woman and ripped her hand up and and then this morning

[00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.240]
first thing I saw when I got off was the story on Channel 7 about the

[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.100]
cameraman's daughter who got mulled by the pit bull down here and you know I've

[00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.140]
said for a long time pit bulls and their owners ought to be destroyed you know

[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.980]
that's basically the way I feel about it. I mean there's a certain mentality

[00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.420]
there but I'll get into that you know we'll get into that a little bit later.

[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.040]
Was it lead story on four last night? First story? I think it might I think it was and

[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.160]
then that they show this morning with the Bryant Gumball whose voice reached

[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.900]
new highs this morning at various times during the show they had a little

[00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.040]
segment about the FCC ruling which I thought I'd mentioned because some of you

[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.140]
may have seen it and they had Diane Callore on again from the FCC but she is I

[00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.840]
hope they keep bringing her out everywhere because she's pathetic and they had a

[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.120]
guy named Barry Lynn which is great I like people that have two first names and

[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.200]
they had Barry Lynn from the ACIU on of course they're challenging the FCC

[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.220]
ruling on so-called in decent speech and again she gave absolutely all kinds of

[00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.240]
double talk and he really put her to shame even though the segment was very short

[00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.520]
and they showed a little bit of George Carlin and you know he made an

[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.580]
ass out of her and the bottom line of the whole thing was that they still can't

[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.360]
define what they're talking about she did all kinds of double talk about well

[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.500]
you know you're carrying it too far and we're not suggesting that all sexual

[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.140]
innuendo or double entendre is actionable in fact most of what the Howard

[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.760]
Stern stuff we heard was okay it was just certain things but they won't tell us

[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.200]
what the certain things were say so they want you to continue playing the

[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.320]
guessing game which certain things were actionable they won't tell us and if

[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.620]
you haven't sent in for so far by the way this Friday were and I know originally

[00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.800]
I had said by the fourth of July we're gonna wrap this thing up and you know

[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.640]
march on Washington but that just wasn't giving us enough time and there's no

[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.920]
sense in doing it you know too quickly or having any sense of urgency because

[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.260]
obviously you know we've got a lot of time to carry this thing on and rather than

[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.600]
just wrap it up now with about 30 or 40 thousand signatures and saying this is

[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.200]
the best we can do we're you know moving onward and upward and this Friday we're

[00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.260]
gonna have two pages two full pages the centerfold no pictures now but we

[00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.780]
get out a picture of you that would have gotten a lot of attention or or a

[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.140]
picture with my name under it just of no I think the picture with your face

[00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.140]
we've got a lot of attention the picture the guy off the Zeta radio guide

[00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.980]
oh that would have been a lot of attention for most radio broadcasters because

[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.360]
you know most of them right they don't want to admit it but my name under it or

[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.020]
we could use the picture from the heraldis morning from page 2b in the local

[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.000]
section Sean Pagic is in the pool at the Cleveland or Hotel on Miami Beach and

[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.760]
if you're listening Sean we're gonna be giving the number shortly but anyway

[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.100]
so you finally found something in the herald you like worth yeah oh yeah well worth

[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.760]
the quarter right spend a quarter for that but anyway what was I talking about

[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.340]
or they add this Friday and of course you folks in the general pubic out there

[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.700]
you're not gonna be able to get it because unless you're a radio fanatic and

[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.760]
subscribed to it which is unlikely groupy but R&R radio and records has

[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.580]
really replaced billboard I mean only stodgy old silly people read billboard

[00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.320]
magazine now and people who are you know looking for jobs in Tacoma

[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.180]
Washington or Evansville Illinois little tiny markets read broadcasting all the

[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.740]
good jobs are in R&R which is why everybody in the business reads it and why

[00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.460]
they don't let us get it here in the building oh that's true are you never see

[00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.580]
it come into this building do you not a while somebody will sneak it in a

[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.500]
plain brown envelope not on this side of the building no but we never get to see

[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.560]
it back here because they have all the good jobs in it but anyway we have the

[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.520]
center full two-fold pages and the ad is geared toward all radio broadcasters

[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.300]
and you know basically the essence is what they are you doing about this to fight

[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.860]
censorship and the fenn free speech and if this doesn't do it nothing will in

[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.340]
terms of really getting some national involvement on this getting everybody

[00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.960]
to write to their congressman well every radio station in the country will see

[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.500]
the ad and by the way this is a piece of good news the senate avoided to show

[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.980]
down with president Reagan today on this is kind of a backhanded good news on

[00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.820]
his veto of the fairness doctrine bill that would have made it law democratic leader

[00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.800]
Robert bird faced with almost certain defeat first refused the republicans a

[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.480]
set time for a vote on overriding the veto then he had the bill routed to the

[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.320]
senate commerce committee under the chairmanship of south Carolina democrat

[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.380]
earnest hollings and uh... they approved a motion to send the disputed legislation

[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.080]
to committee where they're gonna get a keep it hanging until they think they

[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.620]
have enough votes to pass it but it can hang there for an attorney so at least

[00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:18.820]
for the present time

[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.920]
the fairness doctrine is still a provision of the sec but it's not

[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.740]
law is mandated by congress sorry

[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.740]
for once Reagan did something right

[00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.160]
by accident you know if you're in there long enough i mean sooner or later you

[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.980]
can do something right

[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.860]
back there is getting to be a distinct similarity between uh... Ronald Reagan

[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.240]
and the presidency only every other Thursday for about five minutes and that's

[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.520]
it

[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.520]
that's the end of it

[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.260]
so anyway that's what we're doing and if you haven't sent your name and address

[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.520]
to so far yet you know we have two things to point out number one what the

[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.360]
hell are you waiting for

[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.260]
and number two the address is so far p o box twenty two fourteen

[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.360]
my amy three three o five five all you've got to do is send us your name and

[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.420]
address we supply the postage on the post cards and we've done everything

[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.360]
except sign your name for you everything humanly and legally possible

[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.760]
and all the cards are printed up already for you to send your representatives

[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.980]
and senators and you just have to sign them and drop them in the mail that's all

[00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:14.640]
very simple

[00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.780]
and they are paying attention because we're hearing from people they're getting

[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.820]
letters getting letters back from daddy fissile and sure from some of the

[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.600]
child someone told me that all good excellent got a two-page letter from beautiful

[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.340]
child so the more the merrier and that's why you know we're going to get these

[00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.960]
cards to people in all fifty states to write to their congressman but the only

[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:35.140]
way we can send you the cards is if you send us your name and address so far

[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.480]
p o box twenty two fourteen

[00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.820]
my amy three three o five five

[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.340]
another sad but not unexpected piece of news what a depressing Wednesday

[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:48.680]
yeah so are

[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.440]
more

[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.040]
very sad piece of news but as i said not unexpected from a

[00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:54.540]
moronic redneck

[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.260]
is that i hear through the grapevine that the surely painters had a couple of

[00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.080]
guests online so you know that station just has this real problem

[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:06.300]
we've done a lot of shows here with the pre people with aids in fact i think we

[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.500]
were the first ones but you know who cares we're not in in some kind of a contest

[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.300]
to see who gets in a Guinness book of records and we don't do those shows

[00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.020]
for publicity we do them to try to educate the public in the make people a

[00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.940]
little more understanding and intelligent about this

[00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:22.220]
but the w snows every time they do one of those shows there are people over

[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.620]
there certain individuals three of them basically followed tops in and now

[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:26.440]
which there who just

[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.600]
have a nervous breakdown and they don't want to come in the studio and they're

[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.580]
afraid they're going to be polluted they don't want to breathe the air and the

[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.260]
surely had a couple of persons with aids on her show last night and which

[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.320]
there refused

[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.500]
to come into the building and they had a call the johnny dolin of uh... am

[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:45.180]
don we have in to do a witchner show because which there refused how long can you

[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:49.460]
go on being a stupid uh... idiotic redneck jury that's the question

[00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.760]
yeah meh it's pathetic it's embarrassing

[00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.660]
meh there is absolutely no question

[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:02.280]
that aids is not a disease that's an airborne virus it's not communicable by

[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.700]
breathing the same air

[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:05.820]
or talking into the same microphone

[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:09.740]
or shaking somebody's hand which i'm sure he wouldn't have done but i mean you

[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.140]
know it's just it's unbelievable

[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.920]
to think that they have such knee-and-the-alls over there like a top-syn and

[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:18.440]
witchner who continues spreading all of this hate all of this hysteria

[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.860]
and of course founder just loves it because basically that's where he's

[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:24.260]
coming from any way is that it extreme ugly right wing position that's what

[00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:24.780]
he's all about

[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.560]
now think about it jury how do you catch aids

[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.920]
yeah hasn't been made very clear in the media while when you're as ignorant as

[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:36.200]
he is you know don't don't expect him to learn something it is advanced

[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:36.840]
state

[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:41.100]
now it's true i mean the man is truly a monument to ignorance but you're the

[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:41.480]
language

[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.180]
he's one of the most bigoted people i've ever known ever come in contact

[00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.120]
within my life

[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.000]
and you know that gun of his is just and it's there's nothing else there

[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.100]
really note you're laughing but i'm serious because i work with a guy for six

[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.260]
years there's nothing else there if you take away that three fifty seven

[00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:57.840]
magnum

[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.300]
there's not even a human being there there's nothing behind it

[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:05.100]
because that's his whole ego that's his whole macho thing is that gun

[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:10.480]
and uh... you know really i hope it never is too late to learn but i think it

[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:14.780]
is case it may be but she just to continue displaying this this paranoia

[00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:19.800]
in this frightening ignorance uh... sad i don't think jury would have done

[00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:25.160]
what it takes to catch aids from an age victim with these people i just don't

[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:29.000]
believe it i'm not touching that line okay okay let's do a break when we come

[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.740]
back i think we got three breaks this hour boy this is getting really

[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.580]
frightening now imagine what happened when we get to a twelve share

[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.580]

i was listening to gloves ninety four this morning i don't like to uh... pick on

[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:32.260]
the other stations in town because most of them uh... don't even deserve mention

[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.460]
but uh... they do

[00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:38.920]
they really do first of all talk about not knowing what the format is okay

[00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:40.820]

[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.700]

code there we know who it was

[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.900]
i mean they spent all the whole time i was listening there was in you window or

[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:14.080]
fact my name was mentioned within the first two minutes i tuned in the show

[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:17.740]
yeah because they were doing uh... who's the dumbest person in south florida

[00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.000]
dumbest man dumbest man

[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.880]
and some old fart evidently it called in and mentioned my name and i didn't

[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.120]
hear that call but i heard a reference to it from a young lady who was taking

[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.860]
issue with that and said that the caller was the dumbest man because i'm you know

[00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:33.060]
all this wonderful stuff and you don't and said that he was an old

[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.280]
and then we didn't hear the end of the word which i thought was very courageous

[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.420]
i thought that was good i it you said they don't have a delay but it sounded

[00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:43.420]
i heard like what sounded like dumping three twelve dumping's not a good word

[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:45.080]
uh...

[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.740]
leaping yeah they believe that

[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:50.620]
like three different times and fifteen twenty minutes that i listen they must

[00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:53.800]
come into work this morning they don't have a delay well then what is that all

[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.400]
about i mean if you're gonna say say the word don't pretend you're gonna say

[00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:01.260]
the word say it is not one of the seven thirty words not i mean gee if you can't

[00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.380]
call a guy an old fart Greg then what what kind of a shit and of course it made

[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:08.200]
no difference because nobody could hear many ways of my he's in another studio

[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.100]
i'm serious couldn't you tell her you'd have

[00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.780]
well that i am the up to you i got this great

[00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:16.980]
stereo in my car that's you know my prized possession

[00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:20.880]
and uh... i've got to turn up plenty loud the music is all the right levels

[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.740]
and everybody else and then all of a sudden

[00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:23.220]
and then

[00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:26.100]
uh...

[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:30.620]
mean what is that all about what kind of a show is that

[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:35.760]
and uh... neal this and neal that and oh yeah we drive in hell and they all

[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.160]
all the time and then it's not a let's uh... this we have to see ever we

[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.460]
need her to shave with today

[00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:43.760]
i mean come on guys let's cut it out will you please

[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:47.400]
get your own material get your own the body here will you

[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.880]
in fact i noticed you don't have to shave his a facial hair off didn't they

[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:51.240]
yeah

[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.080]
what was that for was that for channel ten probably

[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.760]
i don't know i don't know why not a lot of the i can have facial hair and he can't

[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.620]
i think that's what is that we have a racism reverse racism a channel ten

[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:05.340]
black people can have now although in you know camera marshal if he had body

[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:06.900]
hair over his whole head that would be good

[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.080]
that would be excellent

[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.800]
he is he is so bad you know it

[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.300]
not only does he look like he just came in with it from another planet

[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:18.700]
but he know he doesn't do sports he knows nothing about sports if you listen

[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:21.500]
to the substance if you can watch it long enough to hear what he's saying

[00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:26.420]
he has no clue i mean he doesn't know uh... soccer from a curling you know

[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.640]
he's in the twilight zone how do we get to him

[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.400]
it's a world of difference

[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:32.340]
yeah

[00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:36.580]
world of difference waterdale can put a silly well see do i need that must

[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:39.840]
actually look like a silly like the cheshire cat in allison wonderland

[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.800]
he needs to look silly with a mustache

[00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:45.200]
whereas i guess you don't if you would have still had a mustache on it would

[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.360]
uh... i don't know what it means

[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.320]
i guess white guys just can't have mustaches like alan Mendelssohn

[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:54.680]
there's a guy who needs to be covered from head to toe uh... with a big fur coat

[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.360]
or something anything just get him off of the were those stupid props

[00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:01.480]
see i guess today i mentioned all the people that i like on tv so they were

[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:02.580]
giving equal time and were

[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.420]
trash and a few of the ridiculous people on local tv great

[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:07.420]
yeah terrific

[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:13.660]
so you're i did like mark ledner a channel so i wonder if he puts his hair and

[00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:14.720]
curlers you think so

[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.940]
that's the only way any nobody has care that currently seriously

[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:22.000]
he must put his hair and curlers at night all would not be great let's get him

[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.520]
in here early in the morning and doing interview with mark ledner with his

[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:25.020]
uh...

[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.980]
why but he looks just like john crofford in the morning

[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.380]
but i bet he doesn't clean as well

[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.940]
you know you're right he uses wire hangers yeah

[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:38.240]
oh yeah come on mark no more wire hangers we caught you

[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:41.800]
i've never seen a woman with her that currently no

[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:46.060]
well not that you mention it although he has a mustache which is good because

[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:47.360]
it covers a big part of his face

[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:51.520]
see now a lot of us were in radio because we know it fact almost everybody

[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.800]
you know radio is ugly

[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.700]
and there's a reason for we're not going to go on tv and assault the audience

[00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:57.380]
with our ugliness

[00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.780]
but some of these people just don't have enough good sense they won't keep their

[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:04.300]
ugly push off the tv screen now speaking of that like how it's done for

[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:07.920]
example how it's funny on radio but if he really gets that show on tv it's

[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:08.460]
gonna bomb

[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:10.020]
because his nose

[00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:14.200]
i'm going to tell you as bad as david breners knows was howard looks like david

[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:18.000]
brener and ricay's are put together but together he looks like rock saying

[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.100]
you know steve martin at new movie with the pinochio

[00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:21.500]
that's howard

[00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:25.240]
howard wishes it would have grown someplace else but unfortunately uh... nature

[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.480]
doesn't work out that way

[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:30.960]
in this week's TV works in mysterious ways you look in this week's TV

[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:35.040]
guys there's a full page ad for the new dating game

[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.620]
i'll tell show

[00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:40.600]
yet by the way Alice was very legitimately you the interesting part of it is

[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.940]
Alice is under a lot of pressure and a lot of attack

[00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:46.500]
from all sides not from us because we like what he's doing these days

[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:50.560]
but uh... that show yesterday on circumcision must have been really sensational

[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.160]
i heard part of it

[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.320]
where there's some cutting comments

[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.440]
and must have been hot

[00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:00.840]
but anyway he was you know he was apoplectic last week about my Thompson and

[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:01.380]
Thompson's

[00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:05.840]
obnoxious uh... fascistic you know let's uh... tattoo everybody and

[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:09.020]
you just short of concentration camps you know that's where he's coming from

[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:12.560]
now he's got witchner who's doing his redneck i'm not going to come in and

[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:16.100]
read the year thing you know how how must it feel to be over there in the midst

[00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:19.480]
of that mullon jim mung you know over there a double your snooze

[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.280]
terrible unbelievable

[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.320]
bunch of bigoted right-wing redneck fascist pigs

[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.740]
and that's the best we can say about some of those people

[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:33.640]
right yeah

[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.460]
back to look you know it's our cackling pretty soon i'm telling you i'm the

[00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:40.740]
i don't i don't know how we're gonna get the show me the whole

[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:45.600]
depraved this morning is depressed which you can understand shell shot and uh...

[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.980]
then of course all of this other stuff that i'm talking about here's not very

[00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:52.640]
uplifting the top of all off and the thing about the pit bulls and a stuff

[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.720]
they're showing on the news is enough to make you regurgitate and i know we're

[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.680]
gonna get some of these people and if you call me today to tell me about what

[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.180]
wonderful animals they are you see

[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:04.440]
these animals were in bread long ago centuries ago

[00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:08.640]
okay and they were made to be mean and to fight to do this whole business and

[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.640]
there's a genetic thing there now and you're not going to eliminate it by

[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.720]
patting them on head say oh nice puppy nice puppy because when you least

[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:18.900]
expected some of me even turn on the owners when they least expected they don't

[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.540]
discriminate and it's what now they're not discriminating and of course

[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:24.120]
they're also don't give you any advanced warning it's when they all of a sudden

[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.040]
you know have a bug in your ear or something

[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:29.740]
bingo they go nuts in the attack and they grab on and they won't let go and they

[00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:31.660]
just the rip you the shreds

[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:35.340]
now that's you know and i just look to me with seem the pictures of that woman

[00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:38.920]
in california with her dog that was the same as which during his gun it's the

[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.380]
same kind of redneck mentality

[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:44.480]
i mean i can understand if people have a dog to protect them that's one thing

[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:49.060]
but a dog that's like a killer beast you know that's to intimidate people

[00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:53.320]
that that's a different story sick scary pathetic

[00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:59.280]
subhuman and always get these calls every time you do a show on this and

[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:05.380]
these people oh yes my wonderful pet the powwow he's just never never stole a

[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:08.820]
freight train and you know in fact i wouldn't put it past the pit bull you know

[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:12.160]
to uh... you can just see now locking onto the end of a freight train and

[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.640]
drag it down the tracks about any miles an hour i can see it

[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.520]
look at all the fuel we could say right

[00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:21.980]
you always get those calls we've never had a problem oh yeah always get as i

[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:24.780]
said before pit bulls and their owners

[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:26.800]
ought to be up you know put away

[00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:31.100]
ought to go to doggie you have an or hell or whatever it is i'm serious because

[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:31.840]
it's a sickness

[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:36.420]
there are all these you can go down to the animal shelter to the pound and you

[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:36.740]
find

[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:41.100]
thousands of dogs and for those of you who have a weakness for cats which i

[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:45.580]
want to get into you find loads of animals beautiful little animals that need a

[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:49.720]
home that are already potty train they're all they're like they're ready to go

[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.280]
you know what i'm saying all you got to do is give them a couple of bucks

[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:56.220]
whatever it is and take it home and you're all set you got a nice pet all kinds

[00:20:56.220 --> 00:21:00.540]
of breeds mongrels iris centers germans shepherds you name it

[00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:03.180]
we don't need pit bulls right

[00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:06.860]
i mean how many breeds of dogs do we need before we're satisfied

[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:13.220]
so i think the solution is to have all the pit bulls that turn on their owners

[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:16.940]
and then we'll shoot the pit bull when they finish the job and i'm a bingo

[00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:19.560]
it's all over right we got the problem solved both ways

[00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:23.200]

is that is that a tribute to how desperate the uh talk audiences in his town they're desperate

[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:35.740]
they really are oh that's right i heard as a matter of fact i heard that at the 815 i heard

[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:41.260]

[00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:50.400]
crackle kept going on and it was kind of interesting and i realized that we were off the air how long

[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:54.640]
were we off the air for a long time two hours yeah i heard it all that must have been a pubic service

[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:10.360]
he said now we don't want to start up with them again they're not because we understand

[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:15.700]
through the grapevine okay we understand through the grapevine that Peter Bolger called

[00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:21.060]
in one of our a m people oh fm was only off for an hour but it's okay we can give them the extra

[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:26.680]
hour handicapped you know in fact if we were doing six furlongs we could start at the seven fur

[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:30.380]
long marker and we could let them start at the top of the stretch and we'd still beat them you know

[00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:38.660]
no problem even if we were carrying 140 pounds and they had like um dianne wodgetas or whoever she

[00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:43.880]
is but anyway um i don't want to mention Ron's name on the air because he got himself in a lot of

[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:47.400]
trouble yesterday with that excellent call by the way that was right on target when he called in

[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:52.160]

[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:27.440]
FM you know peter who used to be our friend up until a quarter to ten quarter to eleven yesterday

[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:34.320]
about what are you saying very sensitive all they're getting real nervous well they saw that

[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:38.200]
those numbers you know and i was told yesterday that i'm overreacting because it's going to take

[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:43.260]
at least a year for that format to get off the ground and of course isn't that what they said to

[00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:48.100]
the people who preceded the right brothers uh and what happened with them you know until the

[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:51.340]
right brothers came along none of that other stuff ever got off well maybe a couple inches off

[00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:55.680]
the ground that it all collapsed and smashed you seeing those films haven't you sure those first

[00:28:55.680 --> 00:29:02.800]
attempts to fly sure well they all thought it was going to take about three minutes to get off the

[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:08.840]
ground surprise surprise but we're not going to rag him because they're doing their best

[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:10.440]
that we're that's the part that's frightening

[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:20.980]
oh they're doing their best my story do their duty well wait a minute don't

[00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:25.100]
interrupt the of your story ever fits in with the FM oh does it really yeah well good when we

[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:29.200]
get around to it it'll uh piece right together with what we're talking about yeah see this is one

[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:35.380]
of those days where we need to do one of these convoluted uh as Bob Lassiter would say monologue

[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:42.040]
is that what this is a monologue yeah a four hour monologue and then of course there's no time left

[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:47.780]
to take calls Kyle likes that look at him he is foaming at the mouth he's so enthused we might not

[00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:54.400]
take any calls today come on should we give it a shot look at that there's one vote yes i vote yes

[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:58.760]
come on let's make it unanimous let's see come on there's three hands and there are only two of us

[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:05.860]
have four hands there's only three of us well and you haven't even raised a hand yet mr coward

[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:11.040]
spell courage especially but anyways i started to say before before i was so rudely interrupted see

[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:17.140]
now that i said no calls look at that look at that flashing what a bunch of mung brains frantically frantically

[00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:24.020]
flashing they want to talk to you well hey don't they understand we need to rest from them once in a

[00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:28.940]
while i mean who wants to hear these people i'm going to listen to you for one more week i know i

[00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:33.620]
can only handle another week and then he calls back that's the incredible part well i guess he figured

[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:37.040]
if he was going to be calling us he better get it out of the way before he stopped listening

[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:42.540]
that guy i thought about him yesterday man that was incredible wouldn't it be something if he

[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:47.340]
turned out to be the guy in the pool no no i don't think so no one this kid's got a lot more

[00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:56.720]
smarts than that huh yeah now by the way if Sean what's his name here yes he now we're going to

[00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:01.260]
check if he calls in we'll take his call so you're going to have to at least screen the call no he'll

[00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:08.460]
know okay he'll know by the flash on the phone believe me when the light lights up in technicol

[00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:17.780]
then he'll know like unruly children the south florida callers love to pester us oh that's true it's

[00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:21.020]
like little kid i've always said that you know like little kids who taught you and they just

[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:24.380]
pester and pester then they run away because they know they're going to get beaten then when

[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:28.040]
you're least expecting it they start sneaking up and they start pestering again then they run

[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:33.440]
away and it never stops it never stops the gringing the doorbell and running away okay now let's see

[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:37.280]
from everybody in the audience who'd like us just to dump the calls today and do four hours and just

[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:41.220]
you know play it by ear let's see it on the phone i bet you there are a lot of people would like to see

[00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:46.220]
us just skip all the calls today and just sit here and have a good time and shmue's a little bit

[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:51.320]
look at that of course four of them are ringing already but that's okay hey listen timing is

[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:58.340]
everything in life all seven of marlotte i think you're serious about not taking calls serious as a

[00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:06.980]
door knob okay well i have never been more serious in my life you're really thinking about it

[00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:17.640]
wait a minute there were a lot of positive calls about the phone out oh yeah that's right that was

[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:24.060]
last April that's true in fact when we had our guest in here we just talked for four hours we took

[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:30.000]
no calls and they were some of the best shows we ever had with those guests let's see who can we go

[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.900]
out in the building and drag in here the dark i don't think today is the day to go out and

[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:39.860]
keep looking for a ball the days leave it to you to come up with an idea like that oh boy mister

[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:45.340]
tacked you know everybody is weeping and you know and it's a really depressing place today and if

[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:50.580]
you missed the beginning of the show one of our staff members died in a tragic automobile accident

[00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:56.440]
last night very very what was it in his early 20s i would think yeah 20s yeah and very nice kid

[00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:01.580]
and everybody's upset and broken up here and you know to try to develop some kind of you know

[00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:05.600]
for me to come on the air playing some kind of wild rockest thing this morning would have been

[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:10.040]
inappropriate because i just don't feel that way sure would have yeah there were 12 what does that

[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:13.200]
mean in other words you would have jumped all over me if i would have done that you to come in here

[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:18.360]
and say tacky yeah that's what he would have done in other words if i would have tried to lighten

[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:22.640]
things up a little bit and get people laughing you to come in here so there's no way to win say

[00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:28.700]
well we know and now you're saying well you know he's really being depressing getting the audience

[00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:34.600]
into a model in state no no you said that during the break now i chuckled a few times here no i

[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:38.960]
didn't chuckle at all you cackled a couple of mini cackles which is the best we've gotten out of

[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:44.380]
them so far today which brings me back isn't it amazing i've always said that you know what goes

[00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:49.740]
around comes around or something like that and that these things piece together and we went through

[00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:53.600]
that whole convoluted thing to bring me back to what i was going to talk about in terms of that

[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:57.580]
station that i listened to this morning for a half hour coming to work and they were cackling

[00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:02.380]
its stuff that wasn't even i mean the colliders are not funny okay if they would have said gloves

[00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:06.680]
ninety four and cackled that would have been funny maybe they'll do that tomorrow yeah come on

[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:11.380]
Greg why don't you say gloves ninety four tomorrow that would be funny that would be i think it'd be

[00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:16.080]
hysterical if they could i know those jingles they got cost a lot of money but i think it would be

[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:20.020]
funny if they invested a few bucks and got one that said gloves ninety four man that would be that

[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:24.780]
be hysterical look at all the attention we'd promote it yeah sure and then peter would come in here

[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:29.560]
and we'd have another closed door meeting and we don't want any friction between the two stations

[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:33.300]
we all want to get along and the people are not in a good mood up there they're a little sensitive

[00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:38.440]
mm-hmm they saw the numbers a little sensitive well they're super sensitive yeah

[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:45.320]
they're foaming at the mouth they're looking at r and r they're checking the job listings

[00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:52.180]
now listen it takes a long i was told yesterday it takes a long time a long time for that format

[00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:57.780]
to get off the ground it's going to take them a good year at least i'm telling you verbatim

[00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:02.540]
that's what i was told yesterday all right i was not told to stop ragging the fn that's one thing i'll

[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:07.180]
say because they know if they say that to me that i'll only do it that much more say they finally

[00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:11.580]
have learned to understand me here a little bit and that is that they have to use reverse psychology in

[00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:16.680]
fact if they encourage me to come on here and rip rfm then they know i'll probably cut down a little

[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:23.020]
they did not however encourage me so i'm not cutting down they do know that about you by the way

[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:26.500]
whatever they tell you i do the opposite and look how it's working man

[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:31.340]
it's working like a charm look at the rating do we have to talk about how and the can we

[00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:36.440]
uh what do we have to mention how and they all know you know and boy as soon as i heard that i

[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:40.240]
knew i was on the right track man i just attacked it full force and look what we did

[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:46.980]
we had like a 99 share with with the stars and the sunny rosinberg's mazusa we got it all in

[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:51.680]
february maybe sonny could call us today no we wouldn't talk to that douchebag i got a bet

[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:58.180]
all right get rid of him whatever happened to sonny that's what i mean now that he's the mayor i guess

[00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:04.240]
he doesn't have time for us right it's probably blasting out of his office he's too he's too busy

[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:12.620]
doing important thing it's eleven before and he's one of the most important officials in all of

[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:18.020]
south florida i'll guarantee you that eleven before eleven at w-i-n-z and we'll come back after this

[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:26.560]
okay we have a new bumper sticker for owners of pit bulls to display on your automobile bite the

[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:32.400]
hand that feeds you and hopefully your pet will read it a mall the hand that feeds you would be

[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:37.520]
that would be disgusting although it sounds pretty good to me in the sun sentinel my favorite

[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:42.900]
newspaper that comes at six thirty in the morning with the yellow wrapper on it um you notice i

[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:46.960]
qualified that because it's not really very good paper but it's sure better than buying that

[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:52.060]
herald although if the herald keeps printing pictures like this uh now you know the more i look at

[00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:56.320]
that that could be a very young man in that picture they really can't tell they've touched a nerve

[00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:01.820]
with you today well i won't say which one uh now he's not that young he's about uh he's of legal age

[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:06.560]
so i can't get my story out before you talk about this in the

[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:13.440]
tourism panel declares free break dead is this incredible boy what a surprise by scott a's a most

[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:21.340]

[00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:25.540]
uh you know Hitler is dead now in fact i take that back and there's still those who don't believe

[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:31.060]
that who can we uh who can we use this like saying able ink in his dead okay is i mean is that

[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:34.360]
controversial is there any debate about that i don't think so

[00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:45.160]
it's like saying that the nero is dead julia cesar abraham unless of course it's abraham's

[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:51.220]
soloman he's dead too you know he was my grandfather may he rest ovola sholom as they say in

[00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:56.240]
certain parts of the beach hmm tourism see you don't understand any of that that's good we need

[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:59.860]
a good boyish a couple like him in here because he doesn't understand any of those expressions i

[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:07.920]

he's a good jew boy jew boy i mean this man has has prejudicial tendencies that haven't

[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:28.560]
even been discovered in the human race yet am i right yeah but i said in the human race which

[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:33.240]
qualifies it as far as he's concerned but that's an that's an accurate statement about me aren't

[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:38.120]
i a boy boy that's a disgusting and maybe a boy George i think would be more accurate is it really

[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:47.280]
disgusting no i mean you used to call me that oh don't tell me she's jewish yeah oh no ladies and

[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:56.720]
gentlemen all of my jewish friends on this day moni stana halala haza that we all want to

[00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:02.260]

[00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:07.300]
bingo how rich tell Richard Taylor Taylor he'll be he'll take that mrs is off in no time the rostad

[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:13.940]

[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:21.620]
tourism panel declares spring break dead say goodbye to where the boys are

[00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:28.900]
says scott the most in the most ridiculous article that's the opinion of broward county tourism

[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:33.720]
officials who decided on Tuesday and listen to this it took them only one year to kill something

[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:40.400]
that's been going on for 30 years right in one year they killed it and they told it has it now and

[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:46.180]
as i predicted as i predicted on this show they're going to be ringing their hands saying oh what are

[00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:50.680]
we going to do now that's what always goes on in this town like with casino gambling the heralds

[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:56.160]
scared the pants off everybody we don't need it it's horrible the mob okay everybody voted against it

[00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:00.240]
now what do we do well don't ask us we don't know you know that's the response same in for

[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:07.860]
lauderdale all those fascist right wing hateful nasty redneck type people who don't like kids who

[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:13.540]
don't want fun who you know who wanted to be another geriatric paradise they chased away all the

[00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:17.460]
kid of course we include in that group of fascists the police up there in broward the sheriff

[00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:22.660]
and the fort lauderdale police who are probably among the worst in the country in law enforcement the

[00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:28.560]
most right wing militant fascistic boot stomping goose stepping other than that they're not bad

[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:36.900]
oh listen broward county tourism officials decided on Tuesday not to advertise spring break

[00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:43.960]
after concluding they definitely want the fort lauderdale institution to end we've lost spring

[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:48.360]
breaks at james paint and a member of tourist development councils marketing advertising committee

[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:51.600]
if we try to advertise it we are committing suicide

[00:40:56.980 --> 00:41:00.820]
there is too much of a negative image in the college community

[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:09.080]
for spring break to to come back niki grossman said oh yeah she's a genius

[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:14.220]
so to simply market spring break on college campuses again would be a waste of money

[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:19.500]
bob motwani owner of the merrimack beach resort hotel warned that many small businesses cannot

[00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:23.620]
survive without the collegiate business now here comes the book good part when general motors

[00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:27.880]
are forward have to discontinue a particular model they spend years to come out with a substitute

[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:33.080]
he said here they have no plans to generate any kind of business to replace what we've lost

[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:38.520]
that's right very well said that's right same thing that i said months ago in fact i said it last

[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:41.800]
year when they were in the process of arresting everybody and chasing the kids away

[00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:45.540]
now we don't want them here because they got too much money to spend in their too young

[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:49.920]
if they were old and they only wanted the early bird dinner and they were nasty and miserable

[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:54.580]
and drove 10 miles an hour then we'd like them welcome them with open arms yeah exactly

[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:02.620]
with open packages of sweet and low we'd welcome what a disgusting you know this area is such a

[00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:06.860]
contradiction man you walk out and even in the middle of the summer the sun is shining at 75

[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:13.880]
80 degrees the climate is beautiful the natural beauty the sand and the ocean and everything it's

[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:20.100]
just phenomenal the people that run this state man our maniacs from this governor this fascist

[00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:28.460]
governor we've got up there this lying pig of a governor all the way down the line i mean what's the hope

[00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:36.320]
it's like they've taken paradise and turned it into hell which is why we call florida of course a

[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:45.020]
tropical depression boy it's really it's frustrating i guess if you can be oblivious and just go

[00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:48.920]
ahead and fake your way through life and none of these things are important to you then you can

[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:53.240]
survive but if you're one of these businessmen and you have to kind of making your living from living

[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:59.020]
and breathing people coming and spending their money you're screwed you're screwed and of course

[00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:03.280]
our good governor look at all the business we're losing in this state now and we don't want to leave

[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:07.740]
him alone because the democratic leadership in the legislature went right along it oh yeah they

[00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:12.180]
were right there good old ron silver and all those great americans all those douchebags

[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:18.980]
and didn't the jack gordon sit right on this show with thamak first and didn't they say oh don't

[00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:23.060]
worry there's no support for this don't worry about it don't make a big deal about it they

[00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:26.920]
sit right on this show so we just forgot about it and now we're all screwed

[00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:33.000]

[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:21.380]
earlier classic you've got all of the dirty pictures of phb kate yeah it's okay to look

[00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:26.780]
i think pictures of phb k look all we want to do is just we just want to admire well i wouldn't say

[00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:31.860]
that. Speak for yourself. I was. I mean like I said yesterday, you know, having a little

[00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:36.280]
tripping a little bit and bumping up against somebody, that's the first step. Oh, excuse me,

[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:41.440]
you know, like that guy at 7-11 up in the singer island. I'll never forget that. I mean, he had

[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:51.700]
a deathlock on that kid, you know, is embarrassing. These things happen. Excuse me. That happened.

[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:55.780]
And then he wouldn't let go, which you're really created quite a scene there by the pickled egg

[00:47:55.780 --> 00:48:01.760]
counter. It was frightening by the smoke sausages. Now, now, is this the same, is this the same

[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:07.320]
cable company that has had to, you crack yourself up? Well, you're not paying any attention.

[00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:11.100]
Yeah, I'm fine. We have a good thing about this show. I know what I'm talking about, but I hear

[00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:14.940]
just because I don't come here. See, at least I'm not like Stan. I'm not trolling on the air. You

[00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:19.980]
know, I mean, we joke about this stuff, but the Stan legitimately trolls on the air for young

[00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:24.760]
ladies. I hear that air every day, blah, a brown hair, the brown eyed young ladies and brown

[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:28.260]
authorities into Bruno. And the only reason he says, Broward, because he's too lazy to drive all

[00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:31.780]
the way to date the medium, you know, he wants somebody like right down the street. It's a fact.

[00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:38.180]
It is a fact. He's trolling on the air. So while you fishing experts out there, wait till he does

[00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:44.300]
his billfish tournament. That ought to be exciting. Now, what about this show that runs on

[00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:48.800]
body by solar flex? Well, come on. It's a cable. Yeah, there's another one with some drag queens.

[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:54.260]
I heard. Now, see, I don't know anything about that, you know, I color with this bottle is on a front

[00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:59.960]
page and he says to Jessica, I'm sorry. And he says he never cursed as has been reported. And

[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:06.620]
it also says rather trails in ratings race. CBS drops drops to last. So it wasn't just that Dan

[00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:11.120]
was away in Russia. I think it was a poor choice to send Dan to Russia, because all the right

[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:16.240]
wingers who've been, you know, accusing him of being a propaganda spreader for the Soviets.

[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:20.500]
Probably got a lot of credibility now. In fact, I understand the rumor is John Broward's going to

[00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:24.140]
be doing the CBS evening news starting next week. Did you hear that? Yeah.

[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:26.580]
That John Broward and Mike Thompson are going to be doing the news. Yeah.

[00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:29.180]
John's going to do the big stories and Mike's going to do the short one.

[00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:36.620]
Oh, look at that. There's John L. Way hanging out with Phil Simms again.

[00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:40.200]
Those two have been hanging around together a lot lately. You know what I'm serious.

[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:45.860]
Save that picture of L. Way, by the way. He's got more teeth than Wink Martin,

[00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:50.240]
Dale, doesn't he? This paper blinds me. I know. I got to put my phone on.

[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:53.460]
The only news paper in America that you have to have sunglasses to read. It's frightening.

[00:49:53.740 --> 00:50:01.240]
Come. Let me tell you that's a dial tone. Hello. New format. All UFM people who are desperate.

[00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:09.500]
That's fruit cake. Hello. Fruit cake. Hello. Hi. Go to the next one. Hello.

[00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:16.640]
Hello. Or this exciting. Oh, what? You worked with Neil on WNW. Who's this?

[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:22.320]
Who's this? If it's Mark Gregg, tell him I'll talk to him.

[00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:28.060]
Uh huh. He was a boredop. You were on in the morning. He was on in the morning.

[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:31.100]
Who is it? He's a presky Robinson. Is this press caught Robin?

[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:35.780]
No. Who is it? Tom Schaefer. It.

[00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:40.000]
Bo Diddly. Talk about Kaya's Bo Diddly. Why?

[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:44.020]
Ask for the friendly ghost. Yeah. Who is it? It's some lady. You want to talk to her?

[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.480]
Who is it? I don't know who is this. Okay. Wait a minute. I'll talk to her.

[00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:52.660]
Hello. I can't. Who is it?

[00:50:55.220 --> 00:51:03.600]
Who is this? You want to say Mickey Dane? Oh my god. They are. Kyle just died.

[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:08.160]
Mine are almost as enormous as yours, Mickey. I know. We've seen him.

[00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:16.520]
Exactly. Mickey Dane. I can't believe this. You know that we saw, wait a minute.

[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:19.920]
You know we saw Stanley J. Cohen hopping through the atrium the other day.

[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:24.920]
Well, when you put a spell on him and turned him into a giant frog,

[00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:29.880]
then wait a minute. Wait a minute. Then I saw this movie last night.

[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:35.960]
This really freaky science fiction movie on cable. What's the name of that actress?

[00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:41.200]
She was an exorcist too. You know how I'm talking about invaders from Mars. Invaders from Mars

[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:46.100]
is that the name of the movie? And she was eating this giant frog. You know something?

[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:49.060]
It looked just like Stanley. It was going down. I couldn't believe it.

[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:59.160]
I used to do what? Yeah. Yeah. This is old stuff. Exactly.

[00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:03.420]
I think this is some kind of a new shock radio I've been doing this for years and nobody

[00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:06.400]
paid any attention because I was on at night when everybody was asleep.

[00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:14.460]
Yeah. Why is Mickey singing that Screamin' Jay Hawkins record? I'm going to put a spell on you.

[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:21.680]
I can't believe it. Why is that Mickey? All Mercury is retrograde right in the middle of

[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:27.180]
Shirley's show. Well that tells me a lot. Yeah. Incredible. Well it's always retrograde on Shirley's show.

[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:31.660]
See if you can put a spell on Shirley's numbers. Exactly. Well listen, hang in there Mickey.

[00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:37.980]
Okay, we'll see you on the phone. Okay, a long time listener. Bye-bye.

[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:42.600]
There she goes. Mickey, she used to be on Waxi too. Thank God for her. She got off. These calls

[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:46.580]
are great. I know. See we get all kinds of personalities off of you. See who this is. This could be

[00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:53.920]
Rhona Barrett. Hello. Neil does Halondale. That's the movie. She's telling us about Jerry Witsner.

[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:59.440]
Not coming the way we already talked about that. Witsner is a, you know, he's just a wild,

[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:04.940]
right-wing, neurotic bigot. That's all. So I'm not going to retract any of that because it's

[00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:11.240]
all true. I know him. Believe me. I know him like a book and his bigotry is legendary. It's

[00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:15.420]
unbelievable. In fact, when you look up Redneck in the dictionary, you'll see Jerry's picture.

[00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:20.920]
That's it. It's like Desi Rue. I mean, a man is incredible.

[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:27.700]
Is he still, or we saw the new numbers for May? By the way, if Craig is listening, we don't

[00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:31.380]
knock anybody on the F-rag. But don't tell those people on the audience we're making the numbers

[00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:36.880]
up because we give them accurately. We don't knock Craig told some lady on the air at 330 in the

[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:41.640]
morning. We had a report from one of our spies that, oh, don't pay any attention to those numbers.

[00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:44.900]
They're just spreading rumors. Those are only trends and they don't mean anything and the book

[00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:49.820]
won't be on for another month. Trends. Well, you know, it's two thirds of the book. That's right.

[00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:53.020]
They're numbers. We didn't just make them up. They're indicator. It's research.

[00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:56.040]
Strong indicator. And boy, I'm telling you, those nighttime numbers,

[00:53:56.620 --> 00:54:00.700]
talking at B-Jerry by 4-1 almost. Miniscule.

[00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:05.640]
Jere. See, the problem with Jere's audience, they're all dying off. That's the problem.

[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:11.340]
It's true. Yeah. Does he still bring you? I know the people who listened to Dr. Bernard.

[00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:13.620]
Their grandparents listened to Jere.

[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:21.820]
The great ghost. I don't care. I don't know. These are great calls. I really enjoy taking these off the air.

[00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:26.580]
Oh, in other words, that's it. Well, no, I'll take a call. Well, we do have to do a break. That's true.

[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:29.820]
And then when we come back, you'll do some more. Okay. And I tell my story. Or not,

[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:33.180]
is the case. Maybe when you get through, when we exhaust all of these celebrities,

[00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:38.280]
then perhaps we'll have time before the show ends and stand comes along. Now, if stand takes calls

[00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:44.600]
today, could you see stand doing this? No. No. No way. No way, Jose. Kyle is thrilled that we're

[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:49.320]
delighted. Why? I felt we owed him something because yesterday he was at the end of his rope with

[00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:56.120]
the major through. And I don't blame him. I mean, Stan, you know, it says right on the log here,

[00:54:56.180 --> 00:54:59.680]
you know, what the spots are. You can call how many breaks you. I mean, is it complicated? Of

[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:04.880]
course, not. Oh, I made it in broadcasting. Look at that. Look at that.

[00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:13.740]
Here's a big article about, uh, in decency radio sound and FCC's fury. And this week's broadcasting

[00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:20.360]
you and Gary. Gary Lawrence. Gary Lawrence. Oh, we both made this. Huh?

[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:25.660]
Other morning people may not offer quite the same degree of shock, but there are those who seek

[00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:33.500]
and profit from controversy. James Moby-Carnie on K-E-G-L-F-M Fort Worth has been quoted as saying,

[00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:38.960]
I pick on ladies, I pick on gays, I pick my nose, I pick on fat white guys, red necks and

[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:43.820]
foreigners. Well, that sounds like Stan Major. listeners in the Miami area have complained to the

[00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:48.900]
commission that W-I-N-Z FM's neo-rodgers. What do you like that? Why are they ahead of their time

[00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:55.580]
or what? All right, let's hear it for Broadcasting Magazine. W-I-N-Z. Oh, if theater boulders in the

[00:55:55.580 --> 00:56:01.600]
building, it's going to be coronary time on the FM. You got to. listeners in the Miami area have

[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:07.200]
complained to the commission that W-I-N-Z FM's neo-rodgers, the grades women, maligns the Pope,

[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:13.020]
is racist and anti-Semitic. One writer who said, Roger's called one woman an old fart.

[00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:19.760]
Only one? Yeah, we've called a lot of people old fart. And you know what, every one of them we

[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:24.440]
call that was exactly that. Well, we're men too. Now, where's about Gary Lawrence? Is that in here

[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:33.740]
later on? Whose picture is that? Yeah. Okay. Gary Lawrence, general manager of W-I-N-Z FM,

[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:40.040]
said Roger's style is far removed from the stern, but not so far removed that he cannot be in

[00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:44.900]
Lawrence's words insulting and controversial. He also noted that Roger's is the number one talk show

[00:56:44.900 --> 00:56:51.840]
in South Florida. And that's it. And the rest goes on about that simple to enough the Kerala

[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:56.880]
Fox and Providence. Oh, that's who she does. She does a potty mouth idiot. Howard Stern clone.

[00:56:56.980 --> 00:57:03.320]
Yeah, exactly. She went to class to copy Howard Stern study this tape. Yeah. Brilliant. Really good.

[00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:10.400]
Quello lays it out. Former Broadcast station manager and current FCC commissioner James Quello.

[00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:16.040]
He's the one that put all that dead air on WJR years ago. Touch briefly on the FCC's

[00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:19.760]
indecency policy during a speech to the broadcast promotion and marketing executives honors

[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:24.280]
lunch in June 13th in Atlanta. The commission has caught in a crossfire. He said between first

[00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:29.560]
amendment purists and a growing public public outcry for action against indecency on the year.

[00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:35.320]
The FCC asserted is not an any kind of a Salem witch hunt to exercise evil dish jockeys or

[00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:40.200]
ludes students and we're not creating a new law. We're trying to enforce an established law. He said

[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:45.540]
a law made difficult to enforce because of narrow interpretations of past FCC's. We are,

[00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:50.460]
he said just reinterpreting the commission's legal precedent in a broader more practical way.

[00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:55.200]
Personally, he said as a strong first amendment man, this gives me some problems. But he said that

[00:57:55.200 --> 00:58:01.260]
the FCC's action was a response to a growing outcry citing 20,000 complaints and not three or four.

[00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:07.880]
Now you see that's a lie. Okay. They had 20,000 complaints or letters last year. But the overwhelming

[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:12.260]
majority of those had nothing to do with indecent speech. Those were letters from listeners who were

[00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:16.180]
complaining about signals being interfering or whatever it might have been. I mean, there are

[00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:20.780]
dozens of different subjects and only a small minority of those had anything to do with indecent

[00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:24.860]
speech. At the start of that article, as a matter of fact, there's a breakdown on the actual

[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:30.400]
numbers out of that 20,000. Most of them were television. Yeah. Complaints about the programming.

[00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:34.060]
You know, it's interesting. They did that segment on the Padejo. They had Diane Caloria again in

[00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:38.380]
the guy from the ACLU and Maria Schriver was doing the interview with her. There's something wrong

[00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:42.540]
with her job. Oh, man, I'm telling you, your face is not all there. Part of it's missing. I

[00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:46.280]
think you're not married. I think I think I'm sorry. You're not. Mr. Muscle. Can you imagine

[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:50.760]
laying underneath Arnold? But it's interesting. They kept talking about this radio. I'm sorry.

[00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:55.840]
They kept talking about radio as they never at any time indicated the FCC ruling as anything to do

[00:58:55.840 --> 00:59:00.120]
with television, which of course it does allegedly, but it's obviously allegedly, but it's obvious.

[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:07.460]
They're going to look the other way and isn't this interesting in May after the interest of the

[00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:12.240]
public had been stimulated by the publicity given the commission's crackdown. The commission received

[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:19.760]
272 letters regarding obscenity, indecency, and profanity involving AM and FM stations and a

[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:24.980]
category headed AS, all services, including television and cable. The total was 357.

[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:31.400]
Yeah, after they stirred everybody up, that's what they did. They ended up...

[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:36.340]
So if after they stirred everybody up and got public response, you can imagine what it was like

[00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:44.160]
six months before that. Hello. Hi. Yeah. Welcome to Talk to Us Off the Year.

[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:52.480]
WIensys, this guy wants to know if you know what WIOD really stands for. Tell us, sir.

[00:59:56.320 --> 01:00:02.180]
We insist on douche bags. That's pretty good. And how about you? Who was it? Mike Miller? Yeah.

[01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:08.040]
Okay. Hello. Thanks a lot, Mike. Hi. Hello. Nobody there. It was Mike Anthony at that. Yeah. Hello.

[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:13.720]
That's fruit cake. Yeah. He came off of there. When you give it a rest already,

[01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:18.940]
go call Ron and Zach. He needs the call. And you're not supposed to talk to him either by the way.

[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:21.720]
It's not my fault. All right. If Mark, you'll have to do it. I didn't talk to him.

[01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:26.280]
The thing, by the way, that's twice already. I didn't speak to him either time. Yeah. That's the

[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:31.080]
famous excuse. What are you pointing at Kyle? Oh, he's got nothing to do with it. Okay. They

[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:36.080]
boys look at that. You're looking for somebody to blame. Mark. Boy, you're glad. Yes. Not to do with this.

[01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:43.700]
Go ahead. Hello. Hi. It's been out now. Yeah. Yeah. Get lost. My good friend.

[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:49.080]
A roll of that. He's doing something I've seen with a herald. I can tell. Oh, these calls. Hello.

[01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:54.920]
credible, sir. Is it in Pompano? Mr. K. Get him off of there and don't dignify by using him that name.

[01:00:55.340 --> 01:01:00.680]
Hello. Mr. Fruit would be much better. I'm going to have to take a break in a minute. Yes,

[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:06.740]
it is true. Is what true? Neil did make a movie. Neil does hallowed Dale. That's right. You know,

[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:18.340]
hello. Yes. Neil does Vegas. This is Glenn. Two things. Number one. Yeah. That's the

[01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:23.920]
marvelous president we have. Yeah. Oh, how we almost forgot about her in the midst of all these

[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:28.820]
goings on here today. Yeah. And this guy sitting over here always pushing the numbers,

[01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:34.560]
need those calls. We don't need any calls on this show. We don't care if anybody calls. Look at

[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:39.180]
that. They're all calling that we don't care. As we continue to break new ground. You don't call

[01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:44.580]
it when I come back from vacation. I'm going away again and take the call. Oh, no other talks.

[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:48.860]
So they hear it is. Here's the every Wednesday we wait breathlessly. Those of us in the business.

[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:53.500]
We wait with baited breath for the Wednesday Linda Thornton radio column in the Miami

[01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:57.500]
Herald. Don't wait. True. Now, isn't it interesting? Was it two days ago that we got the it was

[01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:02.120]
Monday two days ago and the memory is correct that the arbitrains came out. Correct. And of course

[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:06.700]
nobody anywhere in the country pays any attention to birch because Tom Birch, of course some of some

[01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:12.680]
of the people feel pulled the numbers out of a hat. And the birch survey is still questionable at

[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:17.220]
best because all those little pre-pubes and kids answer the phone at night. And oh, we're listening

[01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:22.660]
to a power 96. So they're making scratching sounds on the phone and on each other. Yeah, he rolls

[01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:27.200]
the dice and comes up with the numbers. And so far, you know, he's rolling your snake eyes.

[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:33.580]
Anyway, there's nothing in Linda's column about the arbitrant. Right. But it came out Monday. But

[01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:41.240]
there is another one of these listings, the birch top 10. Now she were listing birch beer top 10.

[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:45.040]
That would be more exciting like they have a steak and shake. Of course, we know that steak and

[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:49.780]
shake is going out of business because Mike Miller told us that and it must be true. The steak and

[01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:53.240]
shake are no fools. They're not going to come to this market. Even crystal won't come to this

[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:56.260]
market. You notice that? Can you blame him? Well, there's nothing like going to Tampa and going

[01:02:56.260 --> 01:03:00.200]
through crystal and just opening the trunk and say, fill her up. You know, I know. It's greasy

[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:05.400]
little burgers. That's great. When you're depressed, like if you have a bad show, like after Ricky

[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:09.740]
Tiki leaves Waxie every day, he should have a chance to drive right through crystal every day.

[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:15.760]
He's probably going to go through fun ruckers up there. It's right near their studios at Waxie

[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:20.160]
up there where the turn is on sunrise. Am I right? Yeah, federal highway. Absolutely.

[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:24.980]
And one thing about fun ruckers now, there's one in my neighborhood and I finally did get to go there.

[01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:31.180]
Well, first of all, I mean, talk about standing online for an hour and a half to get a hamburger.

[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:35.480]
How good can a hamburger be? You know what I'm saying? I mean, it can be sensational,

[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:40.180]
but to wait for an hour and a half, I can't believe you had to wait. Oh, you wait for a lifetime.

[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:44.240]
And then when in my neighborhood? When you get it, it tastes good, but about three hours later,

[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:48.820]
your stomach is doing the Mexican hat thing. Oh, talk about making a mad dash.

[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:53.300]
Really? After you eat there, you want to stay very close to home for a few hours. Trust me,

[01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:58.040]
you know what I'm saying? Or do a place where they have a very readily available facility.

[01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:02.340]
In fact, for a lot of you people over there, a lot of the prunes in the audience who haven't

[01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:06.680]
had a good movement in a long time, head for that place because, boy, with a couple of hours,

[01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:13.060]
it'll be an explosion. It'll be like an earthquake. But anyway, here's Linda with the top 10 Miami

[01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:17.960]
for a lot of Dale stations in Birch. And to give you an idea of who answers the phone, okay?

[01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:24.560]
What do you think's number one? It's always a ratchee scratchy scratchy WPO, W power, powerless

[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:32.500]
90 seconds, 10.4 share. They got a 10.4 share like I've got an 87.3. In fact, I may be closer to an

[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:39.420]
80. You know what I'm saying? 10.4. Then life with a 6.1. And it's always there is not one AM

[01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:43.440]
station in the list. Never. Not one. There's never been. That's because all these little kids answer

[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:49.600]
the phone. Here's hot 105. And we know that nobody listens to them anymore. Enjoyless 107.

[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:59.400]
And the EDR and GTR and the kids at laxie and magic 102.758. And that's it. From a 10.4

[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:03.520]
down to a 360. In other words, what Linda's trying to say is that AM radio is dead. Of course,

[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:08.240]
we know that Linda's listening here right now. And at the bottom of the column, it says Linda

[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:14.820]
Arthuran will be a guest host on the Roger show from 10.2 PM to 2.2 on W.I.N.Z 790 AM.

[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:21.420]
They know where we are. It's at 9.4. This is not the Sun Sentinel 9.40 AM. Her guests from 10.

[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:28.400]
AM to noon will be radio program and operations directors Peter Bulger of save 94.9 FM Bill Tanner

[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:36.640]
of Power 96 WPO W FM Rick Shaw of the laxie FM and Alvin Alvis Alvis from the

[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:45.180]
Presley Alvis Presley. Nobody can put Alvis. Alvis. Alvis Shirouce. I don't think we can say that

[01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:51.160]
in of WTMI FM though and ever. All these suits in our audience. From noon to 2, her guest will be

[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:58.900]
FM morning DJs Greg Budell of gloves 94. Sonny Fox. Oh, now wait a minute. Was that part of the deal?

[01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:05.140]
Sorry. What are you trying to do? Give me a change my mind about going on vacation. Sonny Fox of Y-100

[01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:15.640]
and Dean Cashman and Jeff Chase of Zeta. Yeah. Oh boy. Sonny's been dying to talk on this show.

[01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:25.140]
American Airlines plays. Sonny's only way sonny can get on this show. Call my travel agent

[01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:31.120]
immediate. Sonny is going to be in the studio. As far as I know. Maybe he'll bring that banana mouth

[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:38.620]
with him. Come along sonny. Are you two? Come along. He's going to be in this studio sitting in two

[01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:45.480]
of these chairs. Dmitations are very clear. You people are to come alone. You're the only people

[01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:50.340]
listed in the Harold are going to be admitted into this studio except for Ricky Tiki is going to

[01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:56.940]
be on the phone this phone. Is that true? Yeah. Why is that? Too busy. Oh, like Carlos.

[01:06:57.260 --> 01:07:02.880]
He's too busy. Well, isn't that interesting? Carlos is too busy and Ricky Tiki is too busy. Now,

[01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:08.220]
I don't want to plan any ideas in your mind but we'll put three in one together exactly

[01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:12.460]
and come up with six in a hand which is what they wish they could come up with in the book.

[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:20.640]
Powerless 96. Tom Birch, if you're listening, why do you take calls with those six-year-old kids

[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:24.060]
who answer the phone who can't even speak English who have no idea what you're talking about?

[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:30.640]
The Birch report. You know what I love in the Birch report when you go down hour by hour

[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:35.540]
in there are stations like 50,000 watt stations that have zeros. And then the next hour they

[01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:41.660]
help like a seven. Seven share. You know what it's like? Remember Paul? Yeah. Years ago it's like

[01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:47.520]
Paul. Why don't you just tell them no request today? That's all very simple. Put your foot down.

[01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:57.460]
Be a man. Like me. Okay, my watch is sliding down my wrist. Okay, a macho man. A macho man like me

[01:07:57.460 --> 01:08:02.300]
with only one limperist. It's 11 before two at WINZ. We'll come back.

[01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:06.320]
HX Renacar helps you get what you're going to on time.

[01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:12.700]
This airport track. Because I learned my lesson, I cashed my paycheck and I took a couple of bucks

[01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:18.440]
out and I deposited the rest of this cash. And thank goodness marked on the slip deposit is cash.

[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:25.060]
Okay, I sent out my checks, American Express, my car payment and FPNL were three of them,

[01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:28.400]
which are three of the most important on your credit report. Yeah. And they sent them all back

[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:35.220]
on collected funds. They're standing. I mean, to hear it is one thing to understand it would

[01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:39.700]
help a little bit. I don't watch those shows. Go ahead. Thank goodness. Well, I knew there was

[01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:44.740]
something positive. Anyway, in the ads and TV guide, there's a guy and there's a girl in the ad.

[01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:50.720]
Well, that's a new day. And the guy is Lee Gillette. That was all I wanted to tell you. The guy is

[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:56.320]
you mean we waited almost four hours for that? That's right. If you want to see what Lee looks like,

[01:08:56.320 --> 01:09:01.880]
folks, look in your TV guide. You want to hear what Lee sounds like? 16 point calls in a row.

[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:06.660]
With Neil Rogers, a 94 W I N C.

[01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:11.480]
Play the one about no Glenn Hill in a rut. Lee was in here. Lee was in here before with his

[01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:15.600]
girlfriend. She said she met him in a watermelon patch. Oh, yeah. And they do it to me all the time.

[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:20.800]
You're wrong. Yeah, I should do a show on Dan Rather today. Joanne wants Glenn to know that Bill

[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:30.480]
from W I O D is waiting for his film equation. Oh, oh, my god. Oh, now if you call him and then you

[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:35.160]
come back on Stan show, we could have perhaps one of the biggest pieces of news. This could be some

[01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:40.340]
of the hottest gossip in the history of mankind. Well, you just said Lee has got to cut a new promo that

[01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:46.220]
says now one rumor in a row. Oh, yeah. Neil Rogers show it. That'd be great. Who said are you listening

[01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:50.860]
now Lee's on the air. So that means he called the PDs off. It's you're looking for. Oh boy.

[01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:55.420]
All right. It could be something. We have a duty. Maybe they got a job for you. Yeah, will you sit there while I call him?

[01:09:55.700 --> 01:10:00.180]
Just sit while I sit where? Just, you know, across the desk. Well, I call the guy. I'm nervous.

[01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:04.860]
I'm nervous. Yeah, just sit in the office. Well, what does that mean? I have to be a

[01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:08.880]
perfection. I don't want me to play. I want, I got to get a witness by Mark and I started yelling at him.

[01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:13.860]
Uh, you'll end up thinking of. I don't know for what? Maybe we help to get the guy job. Yeah.

[01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:18.620]
Or maybe we got him fired. Maybe you got him fired. Not me. Yeah. Maybe they want to play a softball game.

[01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:22.960]
Who knows? Yeah. Why would they call me? Well, we only play a hardball here at W.I.N.

[01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:27.180]
Boy, that can't true. We want you guys in a business to understand that. We only play a hardball. Yep.

[01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:32.700]
None of this soft stuff for us. That's right. And we furnished the balls. Okay. That having been said.

[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:37.660]
That having been said is going to do it for us. But stick around because after the news, we're going to

[01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:41.240]
kind of segue into the stand major show. We're going to start them off. He always is begging, you know,

[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:47.060]
for something really juicy to start off the show. And I have a feeling that today is going to be

[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:51.480]
the day. We're going to have rumors that haven't even been invented yet with people who haven't even been born yet.
