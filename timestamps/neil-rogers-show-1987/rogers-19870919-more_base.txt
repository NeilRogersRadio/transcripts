[00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.000]
Although I'm just an ordinary listener and although...

[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:06.840]
You give me goosebumps.

[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.760]
So I can say you give me goosebumps.

[00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.800]
I give you goosebumps.

[00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.240]
Yes.

[00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:12.860]
What does that mean?

[00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.620]
That's it.

[00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.780]
Well there must be... there's got to be something a little more...

[00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.200]
The sound of fingernails scratching on a blackboard gives me goosebumps.

[00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.600]
Well, I was watching Channel 10 the other day.

[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:23.140]
Yes.

[00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.400]
And that... you just remind me of that guy on Channel 10 that night.

[00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.700]
Who's that? The weatherman?

[00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.260]
Yeah.

[00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.440]
The guy from the airport.

[00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.500]
What is this man talking about?

[00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.160]
I don't know.

[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.960]
The guy from the airport?

[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.640]
Yeah.

[00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.420]
No clue.

[00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.140]
No clue whatsoever.

[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.600]
That's our favorite kind of call folks.

[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.880]
We get a lot of those every day.

[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.200]
So that's why it's so enjoyable to be here at Goodall W-I-N-Z.

[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.700]
The home of manic depression.

[00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.680]
Broward, hello.

[00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.940]
Hi.

[00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.800]
Hi.

[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.100]
Hi.

[00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.380]
Nail.

[00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.980]
I bet you just started ringing a phone, didn't you?

[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.260]
Yes, I did.

[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.900]
That's because I punched up the wrong button, but aren't you lucky?

[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.840]
This is Apple calling.

[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.460]
Yes.

[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.000]
I'll allow you Nail.

[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.580]
Okay.

[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.580]
Good.

[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.060]
I just can't have to say hi.

[00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.920]
Oh, your voice just dropped there for a minute.

[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.580]
It did.

[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.740]
Oh, boy.

[00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.740]
I'm sorry.

[00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.580]
Try to stay in a higher register.

[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.760]
Well, anyway, I'll just can't have to say hi and heart-won-un.

[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.420]
Your shirt was wonderful.

[00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.160]
I know.

[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.760]
Well, anyway, I have a great day.

[00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.700]
Okay.

[00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.880]
Bye-bye.

[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.220]
See you at Hawaiian Gardens.

[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.620]
Bye-bye.

[00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.080]
Bye-bye.

[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.420]
Bye-bye.

[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.180]
Hello.

[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.280]
Nail.

[00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.800]
Yes.

[00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.840]
This is Susette.

[00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.160]
I mean, we have some bullioes.

[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.880]
Susette.

[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.640]
Yes.

[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.460]
Well, I bet you guys have been real busy the last few days.

[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.240]
We should have.

[00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.780]
I bet you've been going bonkers.

[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.500]
Yeah.

[00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:50.200]
Been good.

[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.700]
Good.

[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.580]
Brian and Josh aren't working tonight.

[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.540]
They're not working.

[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.500]
They work last night.

[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.020]
Yeah.

[00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.580]
They wouldn't work both two young studs like that.

[00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.120]
Wouldn't work both nights on a weekend.

[00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.580]
No, I give them a night off.

[00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:01.300]
Of course.

[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.900]
Right.

[00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.220]
Shame on you, Susette.

[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.680]
I'm a good boss.

[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.840]
I'm driving.

[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.040]

[00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.520]
They're there.

[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.260]
I hired them.

[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.080]
Oh, no.

[00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.500]
Wait a minute.

[00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.740]
That's not what I was told.

[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.660]
Well, that's the two.

[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.680]
The wife of the owner was in here a couple of, what about 10 days ago?

[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.600]
And she took credit.

[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.600]
I hired them.

[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.540]
She, she did what?

[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:20.620]
She trained them.

[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.620]
She trained them.

[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.220]
We don't want to get into that.

[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.420]
You know, it's a family show, Susette.

[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.940]
No, they came to me for the job.

[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.000]
I gave it to them.

[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.140]
You hired those wonderful young men.

[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.840]
That's right.

[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.920]
Well, we certainly have always liked you a lot.

[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.860]
Now, we want to know what's really been going on in there.

[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.660]
Has it really been a pressure situation?

[00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.960]
No, it's been good.

[00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.760]
It's been great.

[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.920]
Well, you know, it's easier if I work with one of them because if I work with another girl,

[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.760]
then it's like nobody wants to come in and see us.

[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.000]
Well, why is that?

[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.300]
Because they want to come in and see Brian and Josh.

[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.120]
Yeah.

[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.700]
You know, I get, I have to work during the day.

[00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.080]
That's my crowd, I guess.

[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.880]
I get all the old ladies come in there and they don't want to see me.

[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.240]
Oh, I heard that there was a real surly couple of nasty ladies from Hollywood in there.

[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.640]
Is that right?

[00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.620]
Yes, yesterday.

[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.180]
Yeah.

[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.780]
Who claimed that I sent them there and I want you to know that I don't know them.

[00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.340]
I disavow them and they should only, you know, stew in heaven.

[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.580]
They said, Neil, I just sent a sack.

[00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.820]
They should live so long.

[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.820]
And they wanted to taste everything, you know, and of course they gave them a taste and then they wanted toppings.

[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.840]
And then they were bitten about the toppings and how much it cost and that there wasn't enough.

[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.540]
Well, they didn't eat all of it if it were for to begin with.

[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.460]
It's a good thing you don't have sweet and low on a counter.

[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.220]
No kidding.

[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.120]
Don't you have anything diet?

[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.100]
You know, really?

[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.860]
They want something diet and then they end up ordering a three scoop sundae.

[00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.140]
Tell me, tell me you give them a little milkshake with arsenic.

[00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.020]
That's a real diet.

[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.680]
Tell them that's a permanent diet.

[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.200]
I know.

[00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.320]
But we love them.

[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.860]
Yeah, oh yeah, sure.

[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.800]
You just got a smile and keep scooping.

[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.560]
They probably came all the way from Helen Dale.

[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.540]
Probably, they call up all the time.

[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.600]
Where are you located?

[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.700]
All right, so Brian is not upset, right?

[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.060]
That's the definitive word.

[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.020]
No, Brian's.

[00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:07.340]
He's cool.

[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.280]
He's oblivious.

[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.540]
No, he knows, I think.

[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:11.580]
He knows what?

[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.640]
He understands what's going on.

[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.200]
Okay.

[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.600]
He tries to pretend like he doesn't.

[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.920]
Yeah.

[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.520]
But he's a good kid.

[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.920]
You can say that again.

[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.200]
He's a very good worker, Helen.

[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.940]
Josh is both of them.

[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.220]
Well, Josh is the undiscovered superstar of E-Mac and Boulder.

[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.340]
Right.

[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.460]
He was kind of jealous of her.

[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.440]
Well, he shouldn't be.

[00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.520]
He should get a lot more credit because he knows where it's at.

[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.580]
And Josh is new.

[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.600]
Josh just started a couple weeks ago.

[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.760]
Can you imagine that?

[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.340]
Just starting like fresh and all of a sudden becoming a superstar?

[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.400]

[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.320]
In fact, even the CD we're giving away a little later is called the Joshua Tree by you too.

[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.860]
I would like that.

[00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.660]
Would you really?

[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.960]
Well, good luck to you, Susanne.

[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.500]
Well, thanks and thanks for...

[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.280]
So when, now, what's the schedule tomorrow?

[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.640]
Tomorrow, yeah.

[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.000]
I think Josh and Brian are both working tomorrow night.

[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.880]
Oh, boy.

[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.640]
Wait, one of them's working tomorrow night, not working too.

[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.680]
Wow.

[00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.180]
You only get to see half of it.

[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.860]
Oh, don't say that.

[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.840]
Susanne, that was a terrible thing to say.

[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.780]
Although I would settle for that.

[00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.260]
But that's a terrible thing to say.

[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.920]
Okay, well, listen.

[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.640]
We'll be up to see you tomorrow and just to, you know,

[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.620]
not looking for any notoriety or for any superstar status, you know, just to...

[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.620]
Well, I've only, you know, I've only been there once when you've come in.

[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:26.020]
Yeah.

[00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:32.360]
Well, we've only been there like, let's see, three times.

[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.280]
Yeah.

[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.680]
It's not like Stan and I go up there and just hang out there like a couple of degenerates, right?

[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.040]
We know, they're hovering over the place, right?

[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:41.960]
They're certainly hover.

[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.640]
Yeah, some of the people that come in must hover.

[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.720]
Okay, well, just kick them out and tell them I told you to do it.

[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:48.420]
Oh, yeah.

[00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:49.960]
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow, Susanne.

[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:50.620]
Okay, thanks.

[00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.440]
Okay.

[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.220]
There she goes.

[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.120]
We've just made that whole store into like a legend and they're all mine, you know, it's frightening.

[00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.400]
That's for a little scoop of ice cream with some hot fudge and marshmallow in the whole world

[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.760]
is crawling on their hands and knees.

[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.220]
What's wrong with you people anyway?

[00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:06.380]
Are you desperate?

[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.700]
Are you as desperate as Stan and I are?

[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.460]
That's the question.

[00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.440]
I don't think anybody is that desperate.

[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:20.820]
11 till noon, 11 minutes before that big door is supposed to swing open and Mr. Mobile is supposed to come through the door.

[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:21.620]
But don't hold your breath.

[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.920]
The man couldn't get up this early in the morning if his life depended upon him.

[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:32.860]
If the young lady from the Tinder box were here lying right in the middle of the table in the studio.

[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.760]
Trust me, he'd be here.

[00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:36.700]
Okay, let's go to Dave County.

[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:37.040]
Hello.

[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.600]
Dave County.

[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.940]
Okay, nice talking to you.

[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.660]
Have a wonderful life and up your head.

[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:45.880]
Dave County, hello.

[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.240]
Hello, is this Neil?

[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.160]
Yes it is.

[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.120]
He's Neil has a going.

[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.600]
Good.

[00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.400]
This man could ask me about the trill off.

[00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:53.040]
Yeah.

[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.240]
Not to get off the subject of E-Max and bullios or whatever.

[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.260]
No, no, that's all right.

[00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.240]
We've beaten that into the ground.

[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.140]
Okay, good.

[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.780]
We'll beat this into the ground a little while.

[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:03.320]
Okay.

[00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.800]
The trill off is for what?

[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.740]
Is this Latin so this is supposed to call up?

[00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:09.160]
Yeah.

[00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.480]
I think this maybe you should have one that only Americans are allowed to...

[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.320]
You mean it's we should be non-discriminatory?

[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:21.040]
Well, I felt it wouldn't be any contest because it either would be like asking Gentiles to say Hutzpah, you know.

[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.100]
Trilling is a particularly Hispanic kind of a talent.

[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.400]
And most of us non-latans can't say Carroyo.

[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.780]
You know, I have a particular thing about that.

[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.000]
Well, as I have a very talented tongue.

[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:36.280]
Carroyo.

[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.020]
Not bad?

[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.000]
Not bad, yeah.

[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.340]
Not major league, but you know, maybe triple league.

[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.560]
Well, how long is major league?

[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:42.520]
That's what I want to know.

[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.600]
Well, I don't want to get into that.

[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:45.400]
What is the company?

[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.880]
I think you'd have to talk to Jeff Stryker about that.

[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.820]
I forgot who I was talking to.

[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.160]
I know.

[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:53.840]
I'm sorry.

[00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.220]
You know, my mind keeps reverting back to my primitive origins.

[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.000]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:58.700]
I can see that.

[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.100]
My early pre-pubescent thoughts, you know.

[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.900]
One other thing.

[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:10.300]
I want to commend you on being the nicer one of the, of you and Stan.

[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:16.200]
Well, I'm trying, you know, now, when I stay over on his show, I discover how truly nasty he is.

[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:17.340]
I mean, he gets, I tell you, man.

[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.960]
It's some very nice people calling on a phone.

[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.140]
And, you know, he'll help, especially if they're not female.

[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.280]
If they're female, he'll keep mine forever, even if they're morons, you know.

[00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:28.460]
True, true, because that one guy called yesterday who was on the mobile phone.

[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.560]
And just, he only did mention that he had been waiting a long time.

[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:33.740]
Yeah, and he blew him right off.

[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:34.520]
Yeah, he blew him right off.

[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.040]
Yeah, well, he's basically an nasty guy, you know.

[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.560]
Yeah, he's, he's real uncompressed.

[00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:40.100]
But I'm working on him.

[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.940]
Yeah, well, give it a good try.

[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.420]
Okay, see you later.

[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:44.580]
It'll take a great miracle.

[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.660]
And maybe if we get him in here for a couple hours today, we can lighten him up a little bit.

[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:53.560]
Get him off this nasty kick, you know, he feels that he's got to be compulsively nasty and surly.

[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.220]
Nothing, absolutely nothing will be accomplished by that.

[00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.300]
We're trying to tell Kyle that too, but he won't listen to us, you know.

[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.440]
Hello, hello.

[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:03.560]
Hello.

[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:04.120]
Hi.

[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:04.740]
Hi.

[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:06.800]
Hello, Neil.

[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:07.380]
Yes.

[00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:10.080]
Hi, first time caller, but not a virgin.

[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:10.720]
Great.

[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:19.040]
I was just curious if you've seen the new McDonald commercial with the guy that has a head shaped like a moon.

[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:19.660]
Oh, yeah.

[00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.060]
Oh, that's making me mignocious.

[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.400]
Yeah, and you'll never guess who I think of every time I see it.

[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:25.840]
Who?

[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.760]
It's a good time.

[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:28.640]
Oh, yeah.

[00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.760]
Oh, it's a great taste.

[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:31.560]
Donald.

[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.420]
Yeah, this is the most important question of the day.

[00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:34.820]
Okay.

[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:35.920]
Who did you like that?

[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.720]
Ronald McDonald or the new guy with the moon head?

[00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.500]
I think the moon man.

[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.960]
Oh, I liked Ronald McDonald better.

[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:45.440]
Did you?

[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:46.240]
Yeah.

[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:46.860]
They make...

[00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.200]
Yeah, the commercial is...

[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.680]
They both make me make up shots.

[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.720]
Oh, anyway, nice talking to you.

[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:55.220]
Okay.

[00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:55.740]
Okay.

[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.520]
You have my best two McDonald's.

[00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:58.340]
That's okay.

[00:09:58.580 --> 00:09:58.800]
Okay.

[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.660]
And anybody who eats there can't be all good.

[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.500]
And I made that mistake again.

[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.440]
My car made a U-turn into a burglar king this morning.

[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.700]
And I have got a heartburn.

[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.300]
It sounds like I'm really...

[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.680]
It's got nothing to do with it being Saturday.

[00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.460]
It's just that I have such a heartburn.

[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:14.520]
Killer heartburn.

[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:15.180]
Killer.

[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:19.800]
And it's not just the food, but it's waiting in the drive through a burglar king, especially on the weekend.

[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:23.300]
They bring the especially inept kids in to work the weekend.

[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:27.300]
And the guy in front of me who was in a pickup truck, I thought he was going to come running out of that truck,

[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:33.060]
bus through the drive-through through that window and crawl in there and behead every one of those people in there.

[00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.320]
And legitimately he was... had a right to be upset.

[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.620]
He goes through the thing where they take the order.

[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.920]
And for some reason the speaker coming from inside is so loud.

[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.840]
Try to take your order, please.

[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:44.680]
You know, that loud.

[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.240]
And now he's given the order.

[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.100]
And he asked for whatever he was getting and four orange juices, right?

[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:50.720]
She is...

[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.640]
One orange juice.

[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:56.160]
And he's screaming back and yelling and carrying on and she still can't get it right.

[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.680]
And he finally gets up to the window after the two cars in front of him which took about ten minutes.

[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:01.980]
He's in front of me.

[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.800]
He gets up to the window and now they ask him to pull off to the side.

[00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.300]
Don't you love it when he's going through the drive-through and whatever you want, they haven't got.

[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:12.480]
So you've got to like pull off to the side and wait for them to bring it out to you in about six days.

[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.060]
And the steam was just pouring out of this guy's ears.

[00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:24.200]
So between that and the absolute total Harper and in those croissants that they give you, I don't think I'm going to make it.

[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.960]
So get in here stand fast.

[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.620]
Well, I hear somebody having a nervous breakdown on the other end of this phone and Broward.

[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:33.420]
Hi Neil.

[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:34.180]
How you doing?

[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.440]
This is Jay and you know, Marcie's husband.

[00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.840]
And she's in the car here, wearing a mobile phone.

[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.080]
She wanted to tell you what she's going to make for dinner, okay?

[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:42.680]
Okay.

[00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:43.260]
Hold on.

[00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:45.120]
Hi Neil.

[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.300]
Hi, how you doing?

[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:46.940]
Good.

[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:53.120]
I just wanted to tell you that I'll make you a dinner that'll just surpass McDonald's, okay?

[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.820]
I'm waiting for you and I'm ready.

[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.560]
But will it surpass Wendy?

[00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:58.480]
That's the question.

[00:11:58.880 --> 00:11:59.840]
Wendy's, oh yeah.

[00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.020]
I'm going to open up a restaurant right in my home.

[00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:03.400]
Marcie's just for you, Neil.

[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:09.520]
We're going to have chicken parmesan, broccoli, casserole, whatever you want.

[00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:13.540]
You know, but you can even send me your famous chocolate cake recipe.

[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.760]
No, I'm not eating anymore, Marcie.

[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:16.600]
I'm cutting that out.

[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:17.740]
You're cutting that out?

[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:18.040]
Yeah.

[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.540]
Okay, well, I'll make sure that's...

[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:21.980]
Only fruit.

[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:23.320]
Okay.

[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:25.680]
Okay.

[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.280]
Well, we'll see you at Los Carlos.

[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:32.260]
I'll send you a form of invitation and I'll be waiting for your review.

[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.060]
Okay, get that phone fixed.

[00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:35.380]
Okay.

[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.360]
Okay, see you later.

[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:37.820]
You can bring stand too.

[00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:38.540]
Okay.

[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:40.360]
Bye-bye.

[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:46.520]
Bork will be on CBS Long Form afternoon until the Toronto New York game.

[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.100]
Well, we might pick up some of that.

[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:49.440]
Might pick up all of it as a matter of fact.

[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:50.140]
Sounds good to me.

[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.340]
Let's make some instant programming decisions.

[00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:53.820]
You know, that'll get him a little nervous.

[00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.380]
Those people in the programming department

[00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:59.420]
who just take years off of our lives who treat us like chattel,

[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.120]
like some kind of subhuman douchebags,

[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.520]
like some kind of inanimate objects,

[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:07.820]
a box on their house,

[00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:10.160]
and then some.

[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:12.020]
Four minutes to noon.

[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.260]
Let's go back to Dave County.

[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:13.560]
Hello.

[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:14.680]
Yes.

[00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:16.580]
No.

[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:17.600]
Is this Neil?

[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:18.160]
Yes.

[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:23.860]
I've been hanging out just to tell you I miss your court gesture.

[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:29.840]
You know, you have such a camaraderie that I miss my Saturdays.

[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:30.740]
Well, good luck to you.

[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:31.760]
We'll give you his home number.

[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:32.660]
No, thanks.

[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.460]
I'm sure he'd put on a whole show for you.

[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.020]
Wait a minute.

[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.180]
Now, I want to tell you,

[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:40.140]
all these people that I know they do it in love

[00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.620]
and they also use this food.

[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:43.180]
Yeah.

[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.460]
They're killing you.

[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:45.020]
Absolutely.

[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.100]
A coma would be a blessing to you.

[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:49.740]
I'll be honest with you.

[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.080]
The way the show is going this morning, I couldn't agree more.

[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:52.760]
Let me.

[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.300]
Deep sleep would be a big improvement for me.

[00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.940]
No, I'm suffering the consequences of living with diabetes.

[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.100]
I couldn't want to.

[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.300]
You've got too much going for you to let it happen.

[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.380]
Well, they love me to death.

[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.260]
No, yeah.

[00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:06.780]
That's it.

[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:07.360]
Literally.

[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:07.800]
Yeah.

[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.220]
It's yourself a two-cent plane when you go see Joshua.

[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:17.660]
It's not the ice cream because they're going to bury you with a soda or a sunsian,

[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.140]
you're a cat.

[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.440]
It's not worth it.

[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:22.180]
Believe me.

[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:26.020]
Well, as long as Brian and Joshua come and visit every week, that'll be okay with me.

[00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:27.620]
We'll get a two-cent plane.

[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.140]
Okay.

[00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:32.220]
Stay away from the ice cream and the pizza and all the loving food

[00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:33.660]
that everybody's offering.

[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:34.120]
You bet.

[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.280]
And I keep that vulture you were talking about.

[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:41.600]
I keep telling him no more food in here and he just goes flying up to the front of the building

[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:45.860]
because he, by the time he brings it back here, he's already sucked up half of it himself.

[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:47.840]
He is indeed a vulture.

[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.600]
He's doing your favor.

[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:50.220]
Well, yeah.

[00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:52.180]
But they bring up the rest of it in here.

[00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:52.920]
Believe me.

[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:53.700]
Trust me.

[00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:54.780]
We call his fault.

[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.520]
He's too sweet.

[00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:57.240]
Well.

[00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.120]
Yes, sir.

[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.760]
He laughed at everything you say.

[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:01.160]
Yeah.

[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.420]
Perfect harmony.

[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.620]
And I'm missing one.

[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:04.400]
He's not there.

[00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:05.320]
Perfect idiot.

[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.620]
Well, maybe so, but there's no.

[00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:10.160]
I always thought nobody was perfect until we discovered him.

[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:11.380]
Nobody's perfect.

[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.440]
But stay away from the food.

[00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:14.500]
You're so young.

[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:15.120]
Oh, yeah.

[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:16.980]
Almost as young as Joey Reynolds.

[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:18.520]
No, I'm telling you.

[00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:21.820]
I'm suffering the consequences of doing what you're doing now.

[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:23.640]
It's not worth it.

[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.260]
I know.

[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:25.240]
You're right.

[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:25.880]
It'd be dead.

[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:26.500]
Okay.

[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.220]
Well, I couldn't go along with you more.

[00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.700]
Have a wonderful weekend and have a great life.

[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:31.100]
Hell no.

[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:32.880]
Unbelievable.

[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:33.920]
It could be a lot worse.

[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:37.760]
You could have the Rick Edwards disease where you start running around nailing things to the ceiling.

[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.660]
It's 12-0 way to W.I. and Z.

[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.200]
And guess who is in the building?

[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.480]
Not feeling too well.

[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:44.640]
You look under the weather today.

[00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:47.600]
But the trip back to the Tinder box will straighten that all out.

[00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:51.460]
I just thought you were going to come in here and slump down on the chair and sleep.

[00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.260]
That's, you know, who needs that?

[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.260]
We could have had the nerd come in and do that.

[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.120]
Just make some breathing sounds.

[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:00.820]
Yeah.

[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.780]
Maybe it'll attract, you know, like the honey bee.

[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.200]
Well, I can brighten everybody up in the day.

[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.420]
And I need some role aids so bad for night's early adult business.

[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:10.100]
Huh?

[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:11.300]
Pepto business.

[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:17.340]
Bring your winds relief kit to WINV in Pearl City.

[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:20.780]
And see if you can nurse us back to a good health.

[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:25.780]
Well, we seem to really put that ice cream store not only on the map, but like they're probably all going to retire.

[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:26.980]
Wait a little, I see the building.

[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:27.580]
Yeah.

[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:28.800]
We ought to send them a big bill.

[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.480]
Well, I don't want any monetary, you know, I'm wanting to take mine out and trade.

[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.340]
I'll take mine in money.

[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:35.160]
Okay.

[00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:36.480]
How are you?

[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:37.000]
Otherwise.

[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:37.820]
Okay.

[00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:39.960]
Are you going to have this contest?

[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.380]
Are you going to have this contest?

[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:42.420]
Not right this month.

[00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:42.900]
Oh, okay.

[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:43.340]
Right now?

[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:44.660]
No, that's your show.

[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:50.600]
I don't come in here, contrary to what other people do when they appear on my program and try to run my program.

[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:55.360]
I'm not going to come in here and inflict my programming ideas on you.

[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:56.740]
Well, that's good.

[00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.680]
I'm not going to sit here and hang up on people like you do because we wouldn't have anything going on.

[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:01.720]
On the guest chair.

[00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:02.280]
Yeah.

[00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:05.100]
Well, I was just to get even with what you were doing coming to host you.

[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:06.360]
You hanging up on every bomb.

[00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:08.960]
Unless it was a female, Roy.

[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:09.940]
So sad.

[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:11.940]
Oh, I'm glad you brought that up.

[00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:16.540]
Because at the corner of Pines Boulevard.

[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:17.120]
Here we go.

[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.240]
And the main rolling again.

[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:20.140]
No, no, no, no.

[00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:22.420]
This is good because this is for charity.

[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:23.260]
I need roll age.

[00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:24.420]
I'm going to pass out.

[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:25.540]
This is not.

[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:25.800]
This is not.

[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.780]
You know, when the book comes out, that's where I think that saves them.

[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:34.240]
There are two teenage girls in the intersection collecting money.

[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:40.000]
Now, Heavens only knows what for at the corner of Pines Boulevard and Flamingo.

[00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:42.640]
And one of them is a really cute brunette.

[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:45.920]
And of course, I was in the right turn lane and they're out there in the center.

[00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:47.680]
So I couldn't even talk to them.

[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:48.200]
What's her name?

[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:48.420]
Wendy.

[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.160]
I don't know what they're collecting for.

[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.680]
They got little yellow baggies.

[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:57.100]
You know, maybe they picked that up from Jerry's fireman friends.

[00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:01.200]
You know, if they can go out there and stand on the intersection with a fire truck park there and collect money.

[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.400]
Maybe these, these nymphats can do the same thing.

[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:06.220]
Nymphats?

[00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:09.060]
Well, I mean, they're looking at the approach.

[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.100]
The approaching late 14 years.

[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:14.540]
And now, when I talk about the ice cream, Mr. Rice, speak of the wonderful young people there.

[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:19.000]
And the greatest respect and with admiration and awe is a matter of fact.

[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:25.580]
Oh, if any of you would like to make a derogatory disgusting terms like nymphant.

[00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:30.320]
If anybody would like to pick up that little brunette and bring her down here, we'll put her on the show of wishful thinking.

[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.680]
We'll put her on the show and find out which is the case of some of my audience.

[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:34.720]
Wishful thinking.

[00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:35.180]
Thank you.

[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:40.820]
How much money we could make for them by having them come in here instead of standing out there under the hot stone.

[00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:42.660]
What would they do here to make money, Stan?

[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:45.600]
Just to whatever there, little bit of the stone out of those bills.

[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:46.480]
Man, look at that.

[00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.200]
We can tell yesterday we pulled out of it.

[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:48.700]
I'll start it.

[00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:49.900]
I'll start with a 20.

[00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.180]
And it's going to be a good call.

[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:56.280]
Probably miners.

[00:18:56.540 --> 00:19:00.820]
They're monitoring in the port of the day and a man comes in here and is doing me a big favor.

[00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:02.100]
That's near century village.

[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.700]
They're not going to collect much money there.

[00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:04.320]
No.

[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.100]
Because those people kind of hold on to there.

[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.180]
Oh, do they ever?

[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:12.640]
Did you hear or see who's that telling about that parable of old bags that came in from the market?

[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.000]
Hollywood isn't that something.

[00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.400]
Wanted a little taste of this and a little taste of that.

[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.200]
Sound like they sampled more stuff than I did.

[00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:18.420]
Yeah.

[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.080]
Well, I want to sample some of the stuff, but they won't let me.

[00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:21.980]
Okay.

[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.720]
Well, let's see what the calls are here.

[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:28.120]
And then in a few minutes we'll do our, you notice what I brought in the Joshua tree by you two.

[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:28.460]
Yeah.

[00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:29.860]
Well, keep your paws off of you.

[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:30.640]
Notice it's virgin.

[00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.800]
It's still got the plastic on here.

[00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:33.400]
Yeah.

[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:37.540]
Well, you have to do some very heavy drugs before you listen to it where the streets have no name.

[00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:38.080]
Yeah.

[00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:40.280]
I still haven't found what I'm looking for.

[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.740]
You notice it's called the Joshua tree.

[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:49.600]
I didn't make that up.

[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:49.800]
Yeah.

[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:50.400]
I know.

[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:51.140]
That's good.

[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.580]
And tomorrow we're going to be giving away Brian's song.

[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:55.980]
Just a joke.

[00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:56.980]
Just a little joke.

[00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:58.020]
Okay.

[00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:58.800]
Let's see what we got.

[00:19:59.280 --> 00:19:59.700]
Hello.

[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:01.260]
Hello.

[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:02.040]
Move.

[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:03.960]
Speak to me.

[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:08.640]
It's an honor to talk to you to a fine gentleman on this beautiful Saturday.

[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:09.960]
Oh, did you hear Elvis call too?

[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:10.200]
Yeah.

[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:10.260]

[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:10.260]

[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:10.260]

[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:10.260]

[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:10.260]

[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:10.260]

[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:10.760]
I heard that.

[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:11.520]
Wasn't that a treat?

[00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:11.920]
Great.

[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.520]
An unexpected rated treat.

[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.660]
Yeah, well, you know, it doesn't call me anymore.

[00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:20.660]
Well, let me just say I heard too that earlier today and I don't know what's going on over at

[00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:21.520]
that ice cream store.

[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.940]
He sounded a little tired to me.

[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.320]
You notice that?

[00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:29.360]
Well, she's acting as bodyguard, defend off all the leftovers.

[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:33.160]
Either that or you've got to work in too hard because there are so many of you who are listening

[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:33.940]
who are coming in there.

[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:34.860]
It's unbelievable.

[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:35.480]
Good grief.

[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:39.140]
Just after a night of those two young men work.

[00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:42.960]
Well, she did say that she hired Brian and the Irish woman.

[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.280]
She'd be on her train, you know?

[00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:44.580]
Yeah.

[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:46.200]
Kind of strange.

[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:49.280]
I live in Kendall, but I'm thinking of moving up to Plantation.

[00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:51.620]
If I were you, I'd move to Waterhill right now.

[00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:52.180]
Waterhill.

[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:53.420]
That's the place to go.

[00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.140]
All depending, of course, on what you're looking for.

[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.200]
Like maybe you're good punching the mouth.

[00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.760]
Oh, maybe I'll go in there this afternoon.

[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.140]
That's when the ladies are working.

[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:01.580]
Yeah.

[00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:03.100]
Haven't you ever been in the one down there?

[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:03.980]
No, no.

[00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:05.300]
I haven't even heard of it before.

[00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:06.880]
I started listening to the show.

[00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:12.380]
Well, we need a report on the staff there at the one in town and country.

[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:13.920]
Is it in town and country?

[00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:14.160]
Yeah.

[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:15.900]
Yeah, that's only a couple of blocks from here.

[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.160]
I might, uh, just zip right and over there.

[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.020]
Go down there and do something.

[00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:21.880]
You've got to know that you'll be lonely and there won't be anybody else around.

[00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:22.860]
No, not in that mall.

[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:24.140]
Stan, where are those?

[00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.280]
As a matter of fact, I remember where it is.

[00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:27.720]
I'm in a charitable mood today.

[00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:28.380]
Where are those girls?

[00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:30.460]
No, they're not your neighborhood.

[00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:34.240]
There's been injuries in there in town and country right on the end.

[00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:35.320]
Yeah, I know where that is.

[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.280]
I never saw any Mac and Bollywood.

[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.400]
That's what, uh, somebody said yesterday.

[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:40.040]
What?

[00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:41.820]
That they were at town and country.

[00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:42.520]
No, they didn't.

[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:43.800]
Somebody was asking that.

[00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.320]
I don't think they're in town and country at all.

[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.520]
Here he goes, disseminating more misinformation.

[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:48.980]
Maybe they went shopping and stuff.

[00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:50.440]
I think that's what Arlene said with their money.

[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.480]
Yeah. Well, what does she know?

[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.420]
What does anyone know?

[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.080]
I want to look.

[00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:56.600]
It's been nice talking to you like I said.

[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:57.140]
Yeah.

[00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:59.500]
This has been quite a learning experience, hasn't it?

[00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:00.220]
All right.

[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:04.380]
And if you had Hartburn like I do, you'd probably get an award just for finishing the four hours.

[00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:07.180]
And imagine you don't even work at the FM.

[00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:07.740]
Right.

[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:08.800]
We could send you.

[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.400]
I don't think there's anybody on the FM.

[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:11.080]
Really?

[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:11.760]
No.

[00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:16.020]
I think that holds the end there playing some of the worst crap I've ever heard in my life.

[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:16.560]
Well, I went up there.

[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:17.120]
There is no one.

[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:17.580]
Yeah.

[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.240]
Boy are they playing some stuff.

[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:20.860]
I was going to make a suggestion.

[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:23.080]
Maybe that it gets you out of doing these Saturday shows.

[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.200]
If you listen to it to talk net, you know what Bruce does.

[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.260]
He takes shows in the event sometimes.

[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.820]
Like if he wants to get out of town and close a real estate deal.

[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:31.240]
Yeah.

[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.600]
Okay, but I like a Tuesday.

[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.700]
On a Tuesday, yeah.

[00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:39.200]
He's got a number and says call here at 6 o'clock and then they tape it and they run it like three weeks later.

[00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:39.560]
Sure.

[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:40.920]
It's incredible.

[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:41.500]
Okay.

[00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:43.140]
It's good enough for Zeta.

[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:43.980]
It's good enough for us.

[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:44.280]
All right.

[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:44.820]
Okay.

[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.460]
Good call.

[00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:50.300]
Yeah, how come the big Zeta Hot Show's aren't working six days a week?

[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:51.780]
Did you hear that?

[00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:52.720]
It's a true story.

[00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:57.800]
They just taped some drop-ins and somebody sits back there and puts all the music together.

[00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:58.720]
And there's nobody there.

[00:22:58.940 --> 00:22:59.540]
You're kidding.

[00:22:59.540 --> 00:22:59.880]
No.

[00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:03.380]
And these guys don't even have the job full-time.

[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:04.540]
I mean, these are just flunkies.

[00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:06.280]
You think they'd be in there seven days a week?

[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:06.820]
Wow.

[00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:10.220]
Crawling on the wall saying, hey, please don't take me out of here, you know.

[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:11.360]
They don't work six days.

[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:17.420]
Nobody in this business in their right mind is abused to the point of working six days.

[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:19.200]
It's just unheard of in the industry.

[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:21.440]
Unheard of.

[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:24.420]
The way to we get our agent from Golden Beach.

[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:24.880]
Yeah.

[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:27.980]
We're hiring a big-time radio agent from Golden Beach.

[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:32.140]
He's going to talk to him in one of those suddenly broken legs talent agency.

[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:33.180]
And I got an interview.

[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:38.040]
A boat-cooled man in Germany was never full.

[00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:43.660]
Well, I was a little meat in the Fort Lauderdale restaurant about 10 o'clock some Saturday night.

[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:44.860]
And Joe's in the Bronx.

[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:46.700]
Hello.

[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:47.600]
Hello guys.

[00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:48.200]
How are we doing today?

[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:48.940]
Howard County.

[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.020]
Welcome to whatever this is.

[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:52.340]
Actually, it's South Palm Beach.

[00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:54.000]
But that's a South Palm Beach.

[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.180]
Now listen, I know I spent years mainly on it.

[00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:05.800]
I don't want to be a chronic pain in the ass regular, but I just had a conversation after the show was going and I had a terrific idea and I don't want him to take credit for it.

[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.980]
So if you barely would be permitted.

[00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:11.740]
Well, if it's a good idea, we never would have assumed he came up with it anyway.

[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:14.160]
Well, you know, listen, what can you do?

[00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:15.880]
Well, if I got a heartburn, you wouldn't believe it.

[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:16.940]
I'll scale up 100.

[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:17.880]
So.

[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:18.760]

[00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:20.340]
Take the bike car.

[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:22.500]
That burglar king will just do it to you.

[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.160]
Well, that was your first mistake.

[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:33.420]
But anyway, you know, Steve Dahl in Chicago has a 976 number 976 4242 to 312 area code.

[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:39.580]
Every day people call up and they, you know, do a couple of minutes for it to bitch and all that and they make a lot of money doing that.

[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:44.220]
I know you're good friends with Dave Ryder who's into that thing, Neil, right?

[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:51.960]
Yeah, I want to tell you something when Dave Ryder was on this show, I asked him to cut a couple of drop-ins or promos.

[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:56.800]
And his response was, well, the union might get upset about that.

[00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:00.800]
Well, here's something that he could make some money at.

[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.200]
So maybe he would be laughing.

[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:06.260]
I mean, Dave Ryder is a wonderful guy and he's made millions of dollars and more power to him.

[00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:07.740]
But he gave you the Don Johnson.

[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.400]
He hasn't shared any of it with his former friend.

[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:15.320]
He owes me because he inflicted me on this place or the other way around.

[00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:18.200]
Right, right. He robbed me into this den of inequity.

[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:27.780]
And what I'm thinking of is how about a 976 Neil line where people can call in, you can do a bit or two and make, you know, mooch-yo-vots?

[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:31.720]
Sounds good to me. You'll give me out of here. It's great.

[00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:38.800]
Well, you know, you can do it first as a sideline kind of thing so you have the money is and then, you know, act accordingly.

[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:42.100]
Yeah, I could probably even record my bits up the ice cream store.

[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:48.160]
I'm sure, but I'm serious. I mean, I, you know, listen, it's a free idea if you want to go for it.

[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.280]
It might be a nice edge on your income.

[00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:54.020]
Or even a 976 stand, I mean, what?

[00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:59.140]
Wait a minute. Look at this. Kyle is writing a message. He told Keith to tell Ryder six months ago to do a Neil line.

[00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:03.120]
The Ryder doesn't want me to make any money. Don't you understand? He's like getting even with me now.

[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.040]
Where is that, if they just see it, something like city or something?

[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.200]
Keith is in Toledo, Ohio.

[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.160]
Holy Toledo.

[00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:10.860]
Yeah, that's what he says every day.

[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:11.800]
It's motorway.

[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:12.280]
Yep.

[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:19.600]
All right. Well, listen, you've got some, he's sticking pins in our $1.00 of Stanley J. Cohen every day.

[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:20.400]
I don't blame him.

[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:20.740]
Yep.

[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:23.000]
Look, you got to work during the day. You can't work today.

[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:24.140]
Right.

[00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:30.000]
Well, anyway, listen, you've got some more mooch-yo records or CDs coming your way.

[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:33.260]
And also, I took your advice and I said, both you guys, briot, adam, tell them.

[00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:33.840]
Great.

[00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:34.920]
About Brian Ferrier.

[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:37.820]
No, no, come on. Brian Adams is where it's at. Trust me.

[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:41.620]
Yeah, I'm really surprised that you're playing Brian Ferrier to a snook it to your eyes.

[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:44.000]
I would think that you would be into playing Love Is The Drug.

[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:45.380]
No.

[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.120]
You don't know it? You know that song?

[00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:47.600]
No.

[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.480]
Stan wouldn't know a good song if it hit him a bit on the lip, okay?

[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:52.640]
I see music. Love Is The Drug. You don't know that song.

[00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:54.320]
Send me the album.

[00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:56.440]
You don't wear a rock.

[00:26:56.460 --> 00:27:00.340]
You evidently don't have access to Brian Ferrier, a rock-sea music album, right?

[00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:01.920]
You can go to a record store.

[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:02.900]
Yeah, thanks a lot.

[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:03.540]
Okay.

[00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:06.700]
Okay, have a wonderful life.

[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:07.640]
See you later.

[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:08.220]
See you later.

[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:14.160]
Hey, tired of sitting around the house with no one to talk to, run out of friends who

[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:19.720]
have tolerated your pointless conversations, then tick up their phone and dial 9-7-6-4.

[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:25.820]
That's right. 9-7-6-B-O-R-E and communicate with people as boring as you.

[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.020]
Hey, how you doing?

[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:29.120]
Okay, how you doing?

[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:29.700]
Fine.

[00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:31.720]
So, what do you want to talk about?

[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:34.420]
I don't know. What do you want to talk about?

[00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:35.420]
I don't know.

[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:40.680]
Yes, from one end of a state to the other, thousands of boring people are waiting to spend hours

[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:45.940]
of an AINN phone gap with you. Come on and join in on the fun. Find that special someone

[00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:47.920]
you can share your pains and joys with.

[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:54.140]
I talked to Dr. Finestein about my back and I said, Dr. Finestein, I got this pain about

[00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:56.540]
the same time my husband Marvin got his growing pool.

[00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:57.220]
Oh, really?

[00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:58.900]
And I just think all the time.

[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.220]
And I'm going to read more and keep it up.

[00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:22.540]
Call now. 9-7-6-4. That's 9-7-6-B-O-R-E. This is hot.

[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:27.200]
Call now. 9-7-6-4. You'll be bored, you did.

[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:27.840]
I know.

[00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:28.880]
And if you want to go out and have fun, you can go out and have fun.

[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:28.880]

[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:28.880]

[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:28.880]

[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:34.600]
The incident conversation, the likes of which you've never heard just 9-7-6-B-I-R-D.

[00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:38.440]
The birds the word, indeed.

[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.920]
Okay, well, listen, stands wandering around desperately trolling for a roll age.

[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.180]
It's 21 past noon and winds will come right back.

[00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:50.920]
Boy, oh boy, Michael, the system, where are you when we need you?

[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:52.400]
Shame on you, Bill.

[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.460]
Okay, stand is in the building, but I have no idea where he's gone.

[00:28:56.460 --> 00:29:00.540]
He said he went to get a sprite, and of course we don't have a sprite in our machines and never have had.

[00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:05.900]
So that means he's probably left the building and gone up to a 7-11 like in Opalak or somewhere.

[00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:07.760]
So it'll probably be back about 3-30.

[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.820]
Where does the man go? You know, where did he go?

[00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:13.800]
Now he'll come back and say, hey, I was looking for roll-aids for you.

[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:14.820]
I'm trying to help you out.

[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:17.520]
He'll have some surly reason that he's not here.

[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:19.700]
Man is incorrigible.

[00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:20.220]
When he...
