[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.660]
no sense in beating around the bush because i'm going to get right to it today

[00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:03.000]
because

[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.980]
a lot to say fact don't rush to the phone because i have a lot of things to say

[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.740]
and i want you to listen very closely and very carefully because uh... who

[00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.600]
knows what evil irks you know the hearts

[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.160]
of uh... people from coast to coast

[00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.200]
i listened to a half an hour when i left this building yesterday that just

[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.440]
turned my stomach inside out

[00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.660]
turn my stomach inside out

[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.540]
and you know i got a pretty good sense of humor okay

[00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.880]
i think i got a real good sense of humor

[00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.120]
and i'm also not thin skin because when you work in this business and especially

[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.680]
in this market for almost a dozen years if you've got thin skin you're not

[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.800]
going to make it

[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.100]
and i take the heat from everywhere now i joke very often about the fact that when

[00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.200]
it rains i get blamed for it and when uh... somebody gets fired here i get

[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.840]
anything that people get upset about i get blamed for

[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.940]
and now we have a new we have sunk to new lows

[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.940]
because now i have trashed my good friend i'm told you know each of the last

[00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.300]
three days has gotten progressively worse

[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.960]
why because i've had the audacity i guess to play that little bit on

[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.580]
card i want you to hear the card by the way

[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.260]
can you hear that i bulker raced at this morning

[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.880]
so you heard that washing sound of the bi purposely didn't do a good job i

[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.640]
want to leave wishes on there okay is that picking up

[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.140]
you can't hear it well that's all that's on the card anyway just little

[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.820]
washing sounds we could let it go the rest of the show could be the new background

[00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.620]
for the news

[00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.020]
and you finally reach a point in life where you get tired of taking crap you

[00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.740]
know what i'm saying you get tired of the abuse

[00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.040]
and you get tired of everybody else thin skin childish people

[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.800]
taking out their anger and frustration on you

[00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.000]
and i hear it on i've heard it consistently you know oh yeah we take a lot of

[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]
shots at people on this show no question about it

[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.060]
but we don't orchestrate an entire program to attack somebody

[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.680]
and here we had a show how many weeks ago wasn't four or five weeks ago

[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.400]
less than that

[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.560]
we're another one of the juvenile people in this market did four hours

[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.320]
four solid hours under the pretensive discussing talk radio of attacking me

[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.640]
including some of the most the wildest lies and hysteria and paranoia the name

[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.040]
what could imagine and i didn't dignify them then and i'm not going to do it

[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.280]
now with a response because it spoke for itself it was so obvious what it was

[00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.900]
and then a couple of days ago low and behold here on the same radio station again

[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.800]
and w i o d we have another two hours with a board up orchestrating over

[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.220]
presiding over that performance of let's attack nila what he does on the ear

[00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.900]
we can't beat him we can't compete with him so let's get him off the air

[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.900]
let's attack him

[00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.260]
we get it from the Miami hero we get it from the Miami news my good dear friends

[00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.760]
at the Miami news who know me so well that's the thing that amazes me about

[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.160]
all of these people who know me so well because they listen to a radio show

[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.140]
who wouldn't know me if i bumped into a men an elevator

[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.200]
like loose salomi never met the man Charlie Whitehead never met the man

[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.120]
and of course my dear friend Howard Kleinberg

[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.020]
and i was beginning to wonder last night i was thinking about all of this

[00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.500]
isn't it interesting that Cox Broadcasting which owns w i o d also owns

[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.040]
Cox newspapers which owns the Miami news and i guess i would sound paranoid if

[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.540]
i were to suggest that all of a sudden these last couple of months the

[00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.520]
Miami news has taken a sour turn on Neil Rogers

[00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.240]
can't miss an opportunity to take some shots

[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.340]
and yesterday as i'm driving out of here i hear that we uh we i guess that's

[00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.200]
the collective we that's so popular on this show lately

[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.880]
we have been trashing stan mager for four hours yesterday

[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.460]
and that came as quite a shock to me because i didn't know that we had been

[00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:20.960]
doing that or that i had been doing

[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.080]
i thought we were having a little fun with that cart which i still think it's

[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.000]
funny you won't hear it again because as you heard i just erased it

[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.820]
and i wouldn't go through the work of putting it on cart again

[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.720]
i thought we were having a little fun with it because to me the hold on johnson

[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.060]
Miami vice thing is is a joke it's funny

[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.860]
evidently to stan it's not funny

[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.440]
and when you take the constant i mean even when you try to do something you think

[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.960]
is for the good of the community like the thing with mr valdez and getting

[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.780]
people to call their elected officials and maybe a handful of malcontents

[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.580]
call with bomb threats or death threats maybe i'm not so sure that any of

[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.300]
those calls really came in but assuming a handful a half a dozen of them did

[00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.040]
of course nobody writes about the other 1995 calls or however many there were

[00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.100]
the only thing they write about is the fact that this show is responsible for

[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.000]
verbal terrorism and it's the kneel ratings again who'll do anything for

[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.320]
ratings but has never done anything positive for the community

[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.040]
in the dozen years that he's been here

[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.220]
again keep in mind the people writing this are all these people who know me so

[00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.540]
well

[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.160]
and i guess seven weeks ago yesterday when my roommate died i must have missed

[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.760]
all those sympathy cards that came from my good personal friends like charlie whitehead

[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.740]
and lucielomi and all of these other people steve cane who know me so well

[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.360]
i must have missed them maybe they got lost in all the mail we get is that possible i guess so

[00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:01.780]
i missed your card steve because if these people all know me personally and know me so well

[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.280]
and know where i'm coming from and know that i'm such a big it and such a bad guy you would think

[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:12.240]
that they would know a whole lot about me which they don't

[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.860]
but somebody who ought to know a lot about me is stan mager because i've worked with him for 10

[00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:25.080]
years he's one of my best friends always has been and if you've listened to my programs when stan

[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.680]
was here before when he was in filial field when he was in phoenix in fact i've had stan we had him

[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.320]
on a phone a few times to do some shows together about different topics from time to time just

[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:42.260]
like we've had gerry Williams on and of all the people i know in this business the one person i

[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:49.320]
have never trashed never taken the opportunity to take a shot at seriously is stan mager never

[00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:02.480]
and i listen yesterday and i hear people who want to say something positive or who think the whole

[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.680]
thing is childish we're all cut off immediately but isn't it interesting how some of these old

[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.840]
parts some of the same old pathetic people like that guy in haelandale who sounds like sonny rozenberg's

[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.440]
brother with the poems or what with his song how many times have we heard that same call

[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:21.540]
Neil condition out but he can't take it and he's singing how many times have we heard that guy

[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.800]
now all of those people seem to be on for a substantial release for a couple of minutes

[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.780]
including the woman again about oh my husband and i how many times have we heard heard

[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:39.100]
my husband and i we were so fond of you when you were here before and we're so happy that you're

[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:44.740]
back but my husband warned me that roger's is using you he's using you as a whipping boy and look

[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:51.520]
out you'll be next he got ernie fired and taffy fired i got news for you folks i didn't get anybody

[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:56.820]
fired i have nothing to say about anything that goes on in this radio station i have nothing to say

[00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:02.680]
about my own vacation as a matter of fact which i don't want to take i'm going on what they call

[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:06.960]
an enforced vacation next Friday if i'm still here by then

[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:16.260]
so i have nothing to say about this show much less about anybody else and yes i was delighted to see

[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:20.800]
taffy go just like i was delighted to see john brownward go but it wasn't my decision it was a

[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:26.980]
management decision and why did they go because they were terminally boring and because their

[00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:33.560]
demographics were a hundred plus because they weren't broadcasters and neither one of them ever will be

[00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:42.440]
and it finally gets to the point where you just want to throw up your arms and say hey listen

[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.380]
you know you can't please anybody

[00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.720]
and i put my neck on the line to get stand made you're hired in this radio station i've fought

[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:57.120]
and screamed and yelled and carried on like a maniac because to me he's one of the finest tacos

[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:02.220]
to the country he's one of the few people who could do what he's doing in afternoon drive and

[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:07.700]
we joke about Miami vice and about don johnson and his obsession with her whatever we want to call it

[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.220]
to joke

[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:19.120]
and i thought we had a lot of fun here yesterday for four hours at least i thought we did

[00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:24.540]
there were people coming in from around the building we're getting a chuck a lot of what we

[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:28.220]
were doing a lot of which had nothing to do in fact most of which had nothing to do with stand

[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:31.020]
and

[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.340]
and i listened to this yesterday when i left here and i just uh i got to tell you

[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:39.540]
you have to really wonder you know life is very short i learned that short time ago

[00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:46.360]
that once you die it's a very permanent thing it's not temporary very permanent

[00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:54.100]
and to waste your time fighting you know it reminds me of what Mike spindell is a good example

[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.360]
classic example i'll use him

[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.940]
mike spindell knows how much i like him okay

[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.500]
there's no way to dislike mike spindell it's not possible to dislike him he's like a little

[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.180]
curmudgeon there's no way to dislike him

[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:15.800]
and yeah he has his eccentricities like the rest of us with his wrestling and his meds and all

[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.720]
of these other little things and yeah i've joked about that

[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.500]
i've talked about different things he's done on his show

[00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:28.580]
we've had some fun with that and i can't tell you how many times his skin has gotten very thin

[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.160]
and he's come back on very upset and wounded with me

[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:37.300]
so when the guy in hell and they'll wants to sing about people who can dish it out but can't take

[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:41.540]
it he's got the wrong guy because i take more abuse than all the others put together

[00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:47.100]
in a week i take more abuse than all the others put together

[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:52.980]
and you know something doesn't usually doesn't bother me and elis bit up until yesterday

[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:57.560]
didn't bother me at all and sunny fox can come on and talk about my trying to change a three dollar

[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:02.040]
bill in windixi and this one can come on and do something else and steve can can come on and do

[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:07.020]
four hours of ripping and lying and shredding and attacking my everything under the sun for my

[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:11.400]
mother to you name it doesn't faze me because i know what the business is all about and i know

[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.560]
the nature of most of these people it's a radio show

[00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:19.480]
and i know that most of these people don't really know me from adam and spider what they think

[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.900]
in a wrong mind they don't know me from woishi puppet okay

[00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:30.280]
and just when you're having a good time and just when you're enjoying coming to work and just

[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:34.300]
when things are going well and you've got gigantic numbers and you're pulled off this incredible

[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:40.140]
miracle of bringing thousands not a few but thousands of people from fm back to a m there are

[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:44.440]
those people who can't stand prosperity they have to have a crisis they have to make a mount

[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:52.300]
nut of a molehill including the people at the corporate headquarters in this company so those of

[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:55.220]
you mouth can tense out there you don't have to worry because you're going to get your way

[00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.260]
whether it's today or whether it's next friday or whether it's a week from sookas you're going to

[00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:07.940]
get your way eventually because nea roger's won't be on w-i-n-z you can go to the bank on that

[00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:13.740]
you can bet your life on it but a lot more than you did on heatwave in the a-thracent

[00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:20.880]
corder yesterday with a much more definite result because there are those people who can't stand

[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:27.520]
prosperity they not only want you to accomplish certain things but they want you to do it their way

[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:36.260]
and the bottom line is in this market and in this uh situation here you can't please anybody

[00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:41.780]
not possible 20 minutes after ten at w-i-n-z we'll come right back

[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:54.060]
24 after ten at w-i-n-z and it's not going to be fun and games today i'll tell you that

[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:58.280]
is if you can't tell it already and i'm sorry about that but i don't think i owe any apologies to

[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:05.000]
anybody at this point and i'm not going to offer anybody any apology today because um you know

[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.980]
it's it's not forthcoming if anybody owes me an apology that person knows who it is

[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.800]
because what i heard yesterday was downright embarrassing and to allow these people these ridiculous

[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:20.540]
little old farts calling it oh he got ernie fired too ernie sochins a good friend of mine

[00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:27.180]
ernie had been a guest at my show for years for years and one day he took me to lunch

[00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:32.040]
in north Miami Beach at corkies i don't never forget the day and he said i really would like a shot

[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:40.160]
i'd love to do a talk show and i got ernie sochin hired on this radio station and to the day when

[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:45.620]
ernie was let go here i was in the understanding that he was still going to be here i knew nothing

[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:49.380]
about it now of course those people who don't want to believe that aren't going to believe it

[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:56.120]
because as usual i'm responsible for everybody who gets fired even on other stations i'm responsible

[00:13:56.120 --> 00:14:01.900]
for people getting fired somebody in the print media i forget who it was a couple of weeks ago

[00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:06.480]
asked me if i was responsible for sandy paint and in my middle are getting fired an iod how do you

[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:17.860]
like that as if i have any control of what cocks broadcasting does and of course we know that

[00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:24.920]
they're such a reputable company and they treat everybody so well including my best friend

[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:29.780]
Bill caller who they've screwed to the point where the man is like inside out and upside down

[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:36.380]
they give him such a screwing and lied through their teeth this wonderful reputable company

[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:38.440]
cocks broadcasting

[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:46.700]
but again i'm somehow responsible when somebody else gets fired

[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:53.600]
you know it's one thing to joke about it but it's another thing when people believe it it's

[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.640]
another thing when they're given the opportunity to come on the year on this radio station and say it

[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:08.900]
because somebody is wounded and i still have no idea about what to be very honest with him i still don't

[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:17.160]
understand it and anytime management has said to me while stan ought to be doing this or stan

[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:23.400]
ought to be doing that my immediate response has been stands doing a hell of a job and he's going to

[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:29.160]
do 50 times better than d'Affi McAllem ever dreamed of and he is already doing that it's already

[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:36.580]
showing in the short time that he's been here it already shows but as i said in this business there

[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:42.020]
are those who can't stand prosperity including the people who own this radio station can't stand

[00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:50.760]
prosperity and i'm not going to apologize to anybody including anyone in portland main or any

[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:55.140]
of the other neanderthals for anything that i've played on the year or said on the year

[00:15:55.140 --> 00:16:02.480]
so the FCC isn't going to take neorodgers off the year because neorodgers hasn't done anything

[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.980]
that's actionable okay not even close

[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:14.480]
but this company is ultimately going to cause neorodgers to be when i say off the year i'm talking

[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:19.840]
about this radio station because i'm not going to miss any meals okay i'm not going to be out of work

[00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:28.020]
but you reach a point of no return in your life and you say you know my life has got to have

[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:34.580]
some kind of value to myself you got to have some kind of self respect and when you sit and you pull

[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:39.840]
off a major miracle on a station that's been the most geriatric oriented station on the AM dial for

[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:45.340]
years with a dying format and you breathe breathe life into it and bring living and breathing people

[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:51.740]
back to it and everybody talking about it and you don't even get a thank you from the people

[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:55.440]
who own and operate it and the best that they can do is say well we don't like this and we don't

[00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:00.140]
like that and we got a phone call about this then it's not a very uplifting experience as i've

[00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:04.820]
always said to you it's another one of those great radio morale boosters and boy do they know how

[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:10.420]
to boost your morale in this business see because ultimately the talent were like were like cattle

[00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:14.420]
cattle

[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:22.120]
and were just used and manipulated and when they've turned the inside out they put you out to

[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:25.780]
pasture and they say the hell with it just like they did at Cox Broadcasting

[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.120]
in the most unceremonious of ways

[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.580]
and you see the the real problem is here that there are people enjoying this show see that's bad

[00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:45.220]
we're having a good time that's they don't know how to deal with that they don't know how to cope with

[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:51.520]
that that's why you find so many people in this business who love to take like the former a person

[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:56.560]
I worked for who owned WNWS Woody Sudbrink he made all his money by taking stations FM stations

[00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:02.260]
and putting in automation machines and putting on slush music music see then you don't have to

[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:06.780]
deal with personnel you don't have to deal with those pain in the ass talent people you just put

[00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:11.180]
tapes on machines and they just automatically keep going all day long and that's what most

[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:15.260]
ownership people in this business can relate to because they can't relate to the fact that the

[00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:19.800]
talent are living and breathing human beings with needs and feelings and who really exist and

[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:26.600]
breathe the air as opposed to just automaton's to be oh there's that word again mindless automaton's

[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:32.160]
like the audience and so you see in the long run the audience gets the shaft too because the people

[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:37.980]
who enjoy this show you're the ones are going to get screwed because I'll find another job I'll

[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.460]
find something somewhere and I'm sure probably make a lot more money than I'm making here

[00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:45.980]
but you're the ones ultimately who are going to get screwed because you're enjoying what we're

[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:49.600]
doing or you wouldn't be listening or those who aren't enjoying those who are enjoying it in a

[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:53.200]
masochistic way are still getting a certain sense of enjoyment from it

[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:03.760]
but yesterday I reached the point at which I finally said to myself hey wait a minute slow down

[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:08.100]
let's put everything on hold I've lost control over my own destiny as a human being

[00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:16.060]
and then this morning when I came in as if I needed any more impetus because I was already

[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:20.740]
going to do this show today is if I needed a little bit more fuel on the fire I find out they're

[00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:26.150]
having a baby so to speak to use the expression up in Portland Maine because Jack Thompson who called

[00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:30.650]
in here yesterday whose name isn't even really Jack Thompson called yesterday to complain to our

[00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:37.170]
corporate headquarters and so therefore we can't play this and we can't play that and we can't

[00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:44.030]
do this and we can't say that etc what we can do we don't know because our management isn't here

[00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:49.350]
so we don't know what we can do but we know what we can't do which is just about everything that

[00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:59.050]
we've been doing for eight months on this show so where does that leave us you see it's one

[00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:03.710]
thing to be out on a limb and I'm used to it I've been out there on a limb for years but when

[00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:07.570]
you're out on a limb all alone and you turn around and there's nobody even behind you on the

[00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:15.010]
bottom of the tree then it creates a problem and when one of your best friends is saying oh gee

[00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:19.950]
trashed me and all my contracts up in February and I wish I was back in Philadelphia because you

[00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:24.370]
played Don Johnson on a tape then you got to say to yourself hey wait a minute so I'm losing

[00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:28.530]
contact with reality or somebody's losing contact with reality here

[00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:43.650]
and it gets old it really does and I think I've got a pretty strong reserve of

[00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:51.550]
whatever it is that is required to take a lot of crap from a lot of people which is one of the

[00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:55.590]
reasons I've issued out that I've learned that in this market that's a survival technique it's

[00:20:55.590 --> 00:21:00.230]
just like with the colors the colors want to be civilized I tried to treat them civilized if they

[00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:03.710]
want to be obnoxious fine I give it right back to them that's called survival

[00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:15.270]
but even when you have a lot of that whatever that quality is you finally reach your point at

[00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:19.930]
which you say hey wait I think I've used it all up it's exhausted and that's the point at which I

[00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:30.590]
find myself this morning because everything that I do is bad I mean you know run down the list

[00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:36.510]
you know I'm a bigot and I get everybody fired and I do all those dirty terrible things on the air

[00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:43.170]
and everything I do is for ratings and there got to be some more oh yeah and I trash stand for

[00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:49.770]
four hours yesterday because I played Don Johnson I mean how can you get to be much worse than that

[00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:54.270]
you know I never killed anybody and I never did steal a freight train or even a caboose but

[00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:59.970]
short of those things you can't get much worse than the erudgers you can't be a much nice to your

[00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:07.290]
guy I mean after 12 years all of these terrible negative things that I've done these device

[00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:12.170]
of things in a community and here poor George Valdez and his family are living in terror and fear

[00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:19.510]
because after all I was responsible for instigating all of that verbal terrorism you know and you

[00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:28.170]
can go right down the list of all these evil terrible things I mean if you listen to some people

[00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:33.030]
I don't even like my mother I'm such a bad guy of course the fact that they take stories out of

[00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:38.310]
context and they lie and they twist and they leave certain parts of it out that's okay that's okay

[00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:45.410]
and primarily you know what was interesting to me yesterday as I listened in that half hour

[00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:50.370]
the younger voices were people saying hey you know you shouldn't be mad at me you know forget

[00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:57.450]
about it no big deal is joke the older voices again the chronic old hyalurys that segment of old

[00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:03.110]
parts who keep this town from being anything who make it into an outdoor funeral parlor as always

[00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:07.430]
those were the ones what because they love it they love to pick this one against that one

[00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:11.650]
they're full of bitterness and hate their whole lives are just filled with bitterness and they

[00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:15.830]
love to share it because as I've told you for years misery loves company and that's where those

[00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:27.270]
people are coming from but you know when the day comes whatever day that is that those people

[00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:30.870]
turn on their radios and they can't find me anywhere in the dial they're not going to know what to do

[00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:36.990]
with themselves they're going to have to find something new and it won't be easy to focus that hatred

[00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:45.090]
on like the old guy from Hallendale with this song who wouldn't miss the show of his life

[00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:50.730]
dependent upon it and like the old lady who calls here air every day with my feet stink you know

[00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:56.350]
the one she called yesterday I forget the line yesterday air every day oh she also called

[00:23:56.350 --> 00:24:01.970]
in during that half hour two the fat bag was obnoxious today the fat bag which got on the air

[00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:11.630]
about three or four times I noticed see that was okay that was good that wasn't the shot that was just a

[00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:21.750]
joke and I think somebody I know ought to be ashamed of himself

[00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:29.190]
because when I need instead of paranoia and instead of whatever it is I can't even describe it

[00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:34.730]
I don't know what is going on in the man's mind what I would need a little support from somebody

[00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:38.750]
because it comes at a time when this show is being attacked from everywhere including from the

[00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:44.050]
people now who own the radio station and once the people who own the radio station decide that

[00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:48.290]
what I'm doing on the air is unacceptable anymore then I can't be here anymore because I'm not going

[00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:52.530]
to go back to interviewing nutritionist who tell you whether your BM sinks or whether it floats

[00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:56.450]
and all that other crap that the other stations are putting on the air I'm not going to do that again

[00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:02.750]
ever if I have to go out and live on the street I'll do it before I'll go back to doing that again

[00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:08.290]
because it's pathetic and because I don't enjoy it

[00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:16.570]
23 to 11 and winds will come right back

[00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:24.110]
24 11 and W I N Z and it gets even better boys and girls during the break

[00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:30.590]
we had a lady in here from the date county sheriff's department to serve me and the station with a

[00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:36.370]
complaint from our good friend Dr. Heffernan and of course this turns out to be a complaint for an

[00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:43.810]
emergency temporary and permanent restraining order from us mentioning the doctor's name or phone

[00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:53.170]
number on the air where's that RF coming from all of a sudden you hear that is it back maybe it's

[00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:58.850]
an omen well if you don't hear it the first time you can hear it the second time anyway so we now

[00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:03.730]
have in our hands and it's kind of fascinating to me because it says in the last paragraph where

[00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:08.970]
for the plaintiffs pray for an immediate temporary and permanent injunction restive already got

[00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:13.650]
the temporary one restraining W I N Z and Neil Rogers from mentioning or broadcasting over the

[00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:17.750]
year the names or phone numbers of the plaintiff and grant the plaintiff any other relief team judge

[00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:22.710]
what's interesting you know the temporary injunction they got had to do with giving the phone

[00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:27.210]
number out because it is a physician's office and we don't want to jeopardize the health of any of

[00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:31.110]
the patients create a problem for them not getting through and we've already long since stopped

[00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:37.110]
giving that number on the air but in terms of the name you see dr. heffernin wants to play the game

[00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:42.650]
but only on his rules see he's become a public figure when he formed his so-called committee

[00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:47.570]
for first amendment rights or whatever he calls it he became a public figure at that moment

[00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:53.070]
when he went on air on w n w s before he hung up on jeff Charles he also

[00:26:54.010 --> 00:27:00.530]
embellished that standing as a public figure when his son was on two days ago on w i o d replacing

[00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:07.310]
sick daddy uh he also became a public figure so the idea that we aren't going to mention dr. heffernin's

[00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:12.690]
name on the air is ludicrous because he's the ringleader of the people who are doing their damn

[00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:17.370]
this to try to get this show off the air and as i said in the first part of the art probably

[00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:22.890]
will succeed not because of their own efforts but because of the company's response

[00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:27.070]
if that makes any sense to you

[00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:38.730]
so this really doesn't amount to much of anything just more of the saying that we've seen before

[00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:42.830]
and again you know the bottom line is that it's strictly censorship and they can deny it all they

[00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:47.290]
want but the bottom line is that dr. heffernin wants the first amendment to be whatever he interprets

[00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:53.630]
it to be in other words we have the right to say whatever we want so long as he doesn't find

[00:27:53.630 --> 00:28:00.110]
an offensive or jack Thompson whoever he is doesn't find an offensive or you know a handful of

[00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:06.230]
other misfits in the market and isn't it ironic that we were running all of that um

[00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:11.870]
effort and energy on the so far campaign save our first amendment rights in regard to the FCC

[00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:15.550]
and they were we were kind of the focal point of that whole business

[00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:20.210]
in focusing attention on the first amendment and the right of speech

[00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:26.030]
and therefore we've become the immediate target

[00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:31.310]
you see because these people can't turn off something that they don't like or that they find

[00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:36.390]
offensive they have to get it off the air and that's been typical with the people on a religious

[00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:40.870]
right for years this is nothing new this has been going on now for 15 years at least

[00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:46.210]
in fact with the Catholic Church it's been going on a lot longer than that because way back in the

[00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:49.410]
40s they were the ones who instituted the rating system for motion pictures

[00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:56.110]
because naturally these people have to set themselves up as sensors for the entire country not

[00:28:56.110 --> 00:29:00.130]
just the community but the entire country telling us what's naughty and what's nice what we can

[00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:03.770]
read what we can listen to what we can watch what we can think etc

[00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:20.630]
and as i said you know if you're out there like the pied piper i've told you that story many many times

[00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:24.530]
where you feel like you're the pied piper you know playing the flute walking down the street

[00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:28.410]
and you know the all the people marching behind you and you finally get to a certain point

[00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:31.150]
you turn around you see there's nobody there you're all alone

[00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:41.590]
and i'm always fascinated by the fact that when push comes to shove your colleagues generally

[00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:46.970]
are just like the people behind the pied piper they're invisible oh don't get me in the middle of this

[00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:52.270]
I don't want to get involved that's the kind of response

[00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:59.710]
because most people are scared for their job well i'm not scared for my job because i'll be honest with you

[00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:03.570]
like i said earlier in the hour from not here tomorrow i'll be working on monday somewhere

[00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:12.270]
doesn't faze me in the least there are a lot of people in fact they're not going to my door all the time

[00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:16.750]
i've been being bugged all week long with phone calls from people who just love to have me go to work for

[00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:22.870]
all over the country because there are a lot of people out there who'd love to have a nine share

[00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:26.270]
of the audience in midday with most of the people living and breathing under the age of 100

[00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:34.030]
they'd find that pretty exciting you know i've said many times before that this show

[00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:39.330]
peels into wind significance in terms of i'm not talking about quality i'm talking about content

[00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:46.470]
in terms of the content level of coming close to the borderline with the Howard Stern show in

[00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:53.530]
New York and it's interesting to me that Howard Stern show on wx arcade in new york is sold out for

[00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:57.230]
the next year and a half they have a waiting list of a year and a half on that program

[00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:07.310]
no don't don't tell them not to send any food here please i'm going to get to that in a minute

[00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:08.970]
okay tell them thank you but no food

[00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:17.890]
that's another thing lately i come in this morning and tweety bird says to me oh there's a pizza coming

[00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:23.870]
i said what is this gonna stop already you see that's the bottom line these people who love

[00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:28.510]
you to death and how many times have i said that in the air and i'll confess there was one day that i

[00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:32.890]
got very upset with staying major but instead of going on the air the next day and carrying on about

[00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:38.830]
it i called i left a very poignant message as Kyle will recall who relayed the message

[00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:47.110]
because diabetes isn't funny it's a life-threatening disease and people lose their vision and their

[00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:52.910]
limbs and their lives from it and i've tried without going into a big song at a dance because i

[00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:58.170]
don't come on the air usually and get into my personal health problem well you know the rash i guess

[00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:01.890]
we could use that as an exception because i mentioned it and we sat here in the phones running

[00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:06.650]
off the hook for two hours about my rash but short of that i don't come in here and cry on

[00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:16.250]
the public's shoulder about personal problems and i have begged people don't send food into this

[00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:24.210]
studio and now every day not once in a while every day we have food coming in for the eating machine

[00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:29.910]
so that when they preside over my funeral they can all say boy he could sure eat a great meal couldn't

[00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:35.370]
they like in the movie fatso boy he sure loved his corn you know whatever it is sure loved his pasta

[00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:42.830]
and so yeah i did take exception with that and i was angry for about an hour i guess about that

[00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:49.030]
would stand major because as i said yesterday i don't hold grudges children hold grudges it's a

[00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:53.230]
childish thing to do and if somebody is really your friend you don't hold a grudge over something minor

[00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:58.470]
and especially where there was no malice intended to begin with

[00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:06.430]
so i'm still confounded can a few dumbfounded be wildered and dismayed over what i heard yesterday

[00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:13.890]
but i'm not going to apologize because i don't think that there's anything that i did that

[00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:19.070]
requires an apology there was no shot intended there was no shot given

[00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:26.910]
and if don't johnson and my army vice are indeed that important then uh what can i say

[00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:31.910]
i thought it was funny and evidently most of the people in the audience thought it was funny

[00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:39.270]
but they're just reaches a point in your life when you can't please anybody

[00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:46.630]
when nobody is pleased with what you do except the audience but you see the audience doesn't count

[00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:51.170]
which is something i've just learned recently see i always used to think that it was the audience

[00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:55.610]
that counted i wasn't told to do the show for the owner of the radio station for the general manager

[00:33:55.610 --> 00:34:01.030]
for the program director for the janitor for my friends i always was told that when you came

[00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:07.510]
on a radio and you did a show it was for the audience and to get the largest possible audience

[00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:11.750]
and to entertain them or amuse them or inform them or whatever the hell i was you were doing that's

[00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:17.370]
what i always thought in it after 27 years in the business finally i discover the audience doesn't count

[00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:23.890]
no we're supposed to please dr heffernin and we're supposed to please bob jumbertson in portland

[00:34:23.890 --> 00:34:28.670]
main at guygan at broadcasting and we're supposed to please god only knows who else i don't know who

[00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:34.050]
but certainly not the audience because you folks don't count we're supposed to please howard

[00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:39.190]
Kleinberg at the mimey news and lucielomi and charlie whitehead and john de grute and mark

[00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:45.990]
fischer and all these other mavens there the folks were supposed to please and not you people because

[00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:52.970]
we know you're a bunch of verbal terrorists you're just bad folks with dirty minds and i love that

[00:34:52.970 --> 00:35:00.310]
line that also went uncontested yesterday on this radio station between two oh six and two thirty

[00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:06.270]
five about all how he came on the air no it wasn't i take that back i'm sorry it was one of the ones

[00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:13.070]
it was the day before on w i o d from our good friend davan other one of the chronic regular

[00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:16.690]
callers and i noticed a lot of the chronic reggares were involved in that exercise yesterday

[00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:19.950]
i even heard our friend mike you know who called in yesterday

[00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:25.270]
hey long since banished from the air on virtually every talk show and tell

[00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:31.230]
but when you get a chance to jump on and make your attack boy they're all right there aren't they

[00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:34.950]
they're all right there

[00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:48.030]
now i forgot the line forgot the line i was talking about that they heard the previous day it'll

[00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:50.610]
come back because it was such a good one such a classic

[00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:58.410]
i mean when you're responsible for so much evil and so many bad things it's not easy to keep

[00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:03.150]
track of mall i should have written them down i don't make notes but i should have written them all

[00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:08.070]
out so at least i forget any of my sins and any of my evils this is better than being Catholic i

[00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:13.070]
mean anybody can go and confess to one priest with a silly frocco but when you can confess to 80

[00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:17.890]
thousand people out there listening then you've really cleansed your soul then you've

[00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:20.910]
at least got purgatory made and maybe heaven you know who knows

[00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:26.610]
nine minutes before eleven at w-i-n-z we'll come right back

[00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:36.590]
well let's not get carried away it just came back to me about the old fart on bill mquie show a

[00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:42.050]
couple of days ago in iod with dr. hoffenmouth and now we're not going to give his real name we'll

[00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:46.290]
just call him dr. hoffenmouth okay forget the injunction no problem anyway

[00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:51.710]
this guy's going on about well uh you know he went on in the daytime and they wanted all the young

[00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:57.370]
people so you know all those young morons all he want to talk about his sex and cars you know so uh

[00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:02.710]
you see here we go again it's always got to be the attack on anybody end of the age of a hundred

[00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:06.990]
because the old farts they own south florida see that's going all the way back to the

[00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:11.030]
halendale business that was the first business of this content when we had people taking up

[00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:16.270]
petitions in front of albarsons and in front of publics to get them off the ad because we

[00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:19.950]
don't like what he's saying see that was the beginning of all of it and of course uh once you

[00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:24.670]
offend the condo commandos boy you got some serious tourists in this town you got real problems

[00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:30.930]
and then when you offend dr. hoffenmouth you got a real bad problem

[00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:36.770]
so the one thing that's consistent about this show we don't we don't single anybody out we

[00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:40.610]
offend everybody even the people at work here are offended

[00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:47.270]
i wasn't that fascinating how come he's upstairs today you notice that that's a first in weeks isn't

[00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:52.610]
it i don't want to mention uh certain animal who's not in the studio here lending moral support

[00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:57.790]
because he doesn't want to get in the middle of all of this he's upstairs in the control room with Kyle

[00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:04.610]
just soaking it all up just being very cautious not to dip his wing in anything poisonous you

[00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:14.290]
understand what i'm saying but that's okay we can survive we'll get through it one way or the other

[00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:21.630]
see the irony of the whole thing is what's ultimately going to happen is i'm going to wind up being

[00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:28.530]
gone because i was too successful too successful see i did too well if i would have just gone ahead

[00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:32.030]
and we would have kept you know booking all of those boring guests and doing the same stuff i've

[00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:36.790]
been doing for 10 years or 10 and a half years whatever it was but no problem we could have done

[00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:41.150]
a nice four and five share and had all the 90 year old demographics and had all the funeral

[00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:45.990]
parlors on the air and just been like it was before and there would have been no problem although

[00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:49.650]
it is kind of interesting that you know when the Catholic church first tried to get me off the

[00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:53.470]
air was for criticizing the pope they didn't like what i was saying about that uh they didn't like

[00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:57.030]
the fact that i was homosexual they didn't like the fact that i was too liberal they didn't like

[00:38:57.030 --> 00:39:01.950]
what i said about uh you name it about the marriott boat lift so you see it really doesn't make any

[00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:06.250]
difference but when you speak your mind it's got nothing to do with vulgarity or with language the

[00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:10.230]
problem is when you really say what's on your mind and you really speak out then you got problems

[00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:15.010]
so all of this crap about first amendment rights and about freedom of speech is just that it's just

[00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:19.570]
crap nobody who really says what's on their mind in this country sticks around very law

[00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:24.110]
because you've got to say what the establishment wants you to say

[00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:28.650]
and that's basically the bottom line

[00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.630]
so

[00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:46.350]
great to be alive isn't it so anyway that's the end of our number one boy just flew by like crazy

[00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:52.170]
what i thought i just sat down here an hour ago and i don't know where anything goes from here

[00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:56.550]
because as far as stan is concerned hopefully he'll be over it yeah i thought yesterday i really

[00:39:56.550 --> 00:40:00.910]
did i thought he'd come in about one thirty we laugh about it and everything would be back to

[00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:06.530]
abnormal but no no way Jose

[00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:17.610]
i haven't got a negative feeling in my body about stan major or mike spindell or ernie sochen

[00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:22.290]
but i'm responsible for all of those people's discontent

[00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:29.990]
i guess even people i don't know who lose a job or who are unhappy or dissent even people i don't

[00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:36.210]
know it's my fault so i hit it on the head yesterday and i think you know i was joking what i

[00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:39.650]
said it but i think he can go to the bank on it if there's anything that you're unhappy about

[00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:42.510]
you can blame me for it because i'm probably responsible

[00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:50.630]
6249400 and date 5249400 and brown or al warnell is here with the headlines world news from

[00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:54.010]
cds at 11 o'clock and we'll come back perhaps at 1106

[00:40:55.130 --> 00:41:03.430]
4th lotterdale hello hi no hi i heard a news report last week about the pro-life people wanting to

[00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:12.010]
keep the abortion clinics closed on the post-surrival for two days and they're threatening to

[00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:20.950]
form a human chain to keep the people from going in the the clinics yeah now i think anyone

[00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:29.370]
who has any sense of democracy freedom and and all the rest that goes with it well that leaves all

[00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:36.710]
of those people out i don't know i i just find that it feels that all the right wingers are they

[00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:43.170]
seem to be the most outspoken and then the most people who are doing all the picketing and all the

[00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:47.430]
the loud mouth in it yeah they're going to make the decisions for all the rest of us and if they

[00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:52.170]
think abortion is wrong even though you know the law says that it's okay and even though all

[00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:57.030]
of those clinics have are licensed by the state and are you know operating legally don't confuse

[00:41:57.030 --> 00:42:01.110]
them with the fact or with democracy or with anything else they're going to impose their wishes

[00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:06.070]
if they decide that the show is offensive if they decide that a station in Jacksonville's offensive

[00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:10.190]
if they decide that a magazine is offensive and shouldn't be a they're going to make the decisions

[00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:15.250]
for all the rest of us and it you have to be a fool not to see how undemocratic and how

[00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:22.630]
how dangerous that is is very dangerous and and for those out there who have any sense

[00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:29.070]
i'm going to be one of the people who who will try to make an attempt to go in one of these clinics

[00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:34.570]
and i'm sorry for the person who tries to stop me from going in yeah well all those people i

[00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:38.430]
got news for them who are going to try to stop people from going in are going to put themselves

[00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:42.270]
in a position of being arrested they're going to put themselves in a position of getting their

[00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:45.750]
arms chopped off yeah yeah because they're going to be what they're going to be doing is going to

[00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:51.610]
be strictly illegal exactly that's all i want to say okay thank you you know it's one thing to

[00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:55.850]
march outside and to pick it with your stupid little signs and to carry on like a bunch of intolerant

[00:42:55.850 --> 00:43:02.530]
children but if you're going to try to stop people from going into a duly licensed place of business

[00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:06.690]
then you're going to be committing illegal acts and i have a feeling they're going to be a lot of

[00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:11.590]
people being arrested that day and isn't it going to be ironic that a lot of this money that's

[00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:17.550]
going to be spent by us taxpayers is going to help to go to arrest some of those people my any

[00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:24.870]
beat chill out the nil yes how are you okay but you're talking about the candidates you left out

[00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:30.090]
i never said i never said anything about the kennedy i never said anything about the kennedy

[00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:36.170]
but i'm saying to you what he's talking about kennedy not the i i also want to bring up wait a

[00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:41.010]
minute wait a minute what what did this man just say did you listen to these first 20 seconds

[00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:44.630]

[00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:49.230]
