[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600]
Well, the closest we have to that is RBD and Broward, which we can't get in date.

[00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.040]
And then there's WHR, which used to be 98 gold, which I hear again is changing format,

[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.600]
but right now they're playing this hard and soul syndicated stuff, which is a lot of

[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.460]
old Motown, that kind of era, which I happen to enjoy, but I can't get the signal in

[00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.920]
day county.

[00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.860]
There's a rhythm 98, which is a small station which actually exists in South Day.

[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.080]
There again, there are a lot like EDR, a little bit more R&B, but you can't get them

[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.260]
passed like Query Gables.

[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.780]
So what is the problem there?

[00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.700]
Do you think something like that would be marketable?

[00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:32.620]
Or am I just dreaming?

[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.220]
Am I going to have it?

[00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.900]
I think that if it was a format of soul and rhythm and blues, like you're speaking about,

[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.460]
that it would have a crossover audience.

[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.220]
Okay, nine minutes before noon at WYNC, we have a caller in a mobile phone for Linda.

[00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.140]
I can't believe it.

[00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.400]
Hello.

[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.880]
RoNeal?

[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.360]
Yes.

[00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.500]
How's it going?

[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.960]
Hi, Linda.

[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.380]
Hi.

[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.720]
I read your column off of that.

[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.760]
Wait a minute, sir.

[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.600]
You don't sound like you're on a mobile phone to me.

[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.900]
I got off the mobile phone.

[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.380]
I got home, put it on hold and picked it up.

[00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.700]
You're hanging up on me now.

[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.620]
What a story that is, even the people at the Harold wouldn't believe that.

[00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.400]
Tom Peeler has been following you around.

[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.380]
I probably won't read it.

[00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.060]
Go ahead, sir.

[00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.040]
We'll give it a shot.

[00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.580]
Okay.

[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.100]
You just have mobile phone to give it up.

[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.580]
I'm following the epsilon.

[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.440]
The situation with all these different radio stations changing format.

[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.120]
I just want to know some of your comments and what you think is calling on seems like

[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.160]
that hot 105 is really bowed out.

[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.400]
Well, they don't have any choice, really.

[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.640]
It looks like power 96.

[00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.900]
It's just that formula.

[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.780]
It seems to be right on.

[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.720]
Yeah, the dance music format, which goes for EDR2 in a way, because a lot of their stuff

[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.440]
is the same kind of rhythm.

[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.280]
It's very popular here right now.

[00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.040]
But again, with so many people doing it, somebody's got to lose and hot did.

[00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.500]
Since then, they've veered a little more.

[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.360]
You hear more crossover.

[00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.940]
Right.

[00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.880]
I just can't put it.

[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.000]
It's like 100 power 96 and hot.

[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.500]
Very, very similar.

[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.200]
I just don't see.

[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.960]
Who do you think the loser is going to be at the most three?

[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.840]
That's hard to say about hot format right now.

[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.460]
Why 100 came back up in this last book after like two years?

[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.500]
They bought some of the audience back.

[00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.500]
They think that was due a lot to that content.

[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.280]
Well, yeah, the content set a lot to do with it, but also their sound is a lot more firm

[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.440]
than it was for a while.

[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.160]
It really seems like 10 is going to be better.

[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.160]
Excuse me?

[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.160]
I said it really seems like 10 has got the formula down.

[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.780]
Yeah, he does.

[00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.160]
It's working for him over there.

[00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.720]
Both everyone in these radio stations know it's continuing over power 96.

[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.340]
That's the one I prefer personally.

[00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.820]
Power?

[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.720]
Yeah, it's just like they really have the personalities.

[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.100]
Power has like one thing good about power too is they have a very energetic presentation.

[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.820]
That's right.

[00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.980]
I think, you know, it's like listening to the old days to me in 70s radio when why 100

[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.540]
was real when I was a teenager.

[00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.540]
You kind of get that feeling from power, which is good.

[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.460]
That's the funny thing is that they're the upstart, but yet they have the veterans.

[00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.640]
That's true.

[00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.020]
Yeah, let me let me let you in on little secret power radio in this market sucks, okay?

[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.720]
You think so?

[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.060]
Yeah.

[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.160]
Does that include your show?

[00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.520]
No.

[00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.080]
On the radio, aren't you?

[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.440]
Well, no, we're on pop-up toasters in the golden fillings.

[00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.080]
That's the thing.

[00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.680]
Okay, thank you so much for your call.

[00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:57.740]
Have a wonderful life.

[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.920]
Hollywood, hello.

[00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.660]
Oh, Neil?

[00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:00.120]
Yes.

[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.520]
I'd like to ask you a Linda question.

[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.960]
I'd like to know what the ratings are on top net.

[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.620]
Too high.

[00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:09.380]
I think that that.

[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.140]
49.

[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.040]
49.

[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.880]
The ratings on top net were pretty high.

[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.280]
I can't believe that.

[00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.680]
I'm talking.

[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.540]
I can't believe that.

[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.240]

[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.320]
I can't believe that.

[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.320]

[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.320]

[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.320]

[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.320]

[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.320]

[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.320]

[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.320]

[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.320]

[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.320]

[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.320]

[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.320]

[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.320]

[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.400]
I can't believe that.

[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.400]

[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.400]

[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.720]
I can't believe that.

[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.940]
I can't believe that.

[00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:35.820]
I can't believe that.

[00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:36.940]
I can't believe that.

[00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.740]
I can't believe that.

[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.420]
I can't believe that.

[00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.200]
I can't believe that.

[00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.260]
I can't believe that.

[00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.040]
I can't believe that.

[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.040]

[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.200]
I can't believe that.

[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.480]
I can give you an answer based on a life experience.

[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.840]
I mean, what is it with this guy?

[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.240]
How many bad things have happened to me?

[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.500]
I know.

[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.900]
You guys good.

[00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.020]
We ought to put him on on the weekend.

[00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.840]
You're pretty good, sir.

[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.800]
He must have been screwed left and right.

[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.420]
I mean, you know, I haven't screwed a lot.

[00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.260]
Maybe I can get on top.

[00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.920]
I don't know.

[00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:02.120]
Really?

[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.980]
Even that or the Harold can follow you around.

[00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.180]
You can get on the front page.

[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.180]
I just was curious because I wasn't to you in a daytime.

[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.620]
And I really enjoy your show.

[00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.100]
But since you've been off at night, there's nothing to listen to.

[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.520]
I mean, Jerry Wichner is passetically boring.

[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.200]
How about Bill Calder's on a night now?

[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.340]
I don't want to promote other videos.

[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.820]
Yeah, Calder's on a night.

[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.740]
Yeah, Calder's on a night.

[00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.140]
Notice that Jerry can't even see the station call letters, right?

[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.940]
Who?

[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.580]
Jerry.

[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.000]
Jerry.

[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.800]
Can't even say a letter.

[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.000]
Jerry illiterate.

[00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.840]
He doesn't say WN.

[00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.660]
WN.

[00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.420]
WN, WS.

[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.700]
Yeah, Glenn Hill does that, too.

[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:32.860]
He says WNZ.

[00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.080]
What is it, Gaker?

[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.200]
What are these people come from?

[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.680]
So call the ship and you're headed by.

[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.280]
You do use a WNZ.

[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.880]
Well, listen, I have the numbers in front of me now.

[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.160]
It's from seven o'clock now.

[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.920]
Four notes.

[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.380]
That's fine.

[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.780]
They went with three, four, four, one, three, nine,

[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.020]
and then after ten o'clock, which Sally's on a 10, right?

[00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.640]
Oh, God.

[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.340]
Oh, yeah.

[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.920]
Five, two, eight, nine, nine, six at midnight,

[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.080]
but she got beat out.

[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.740]
They do embarrassingly well.

[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:55.860]
They do embarrassingly well.

[00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:56.580]
And Jerry, which one?

[00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.200]
Sally's voice says like she guard us with all razor blades.

[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.120]
I love that gravelly voice, sir.

[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.760]
Okay, I got to get another call on here, sir,

[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.540]
but thank you so much for your call and have a great day.

[00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:06.940]
Oh, thank you so much for letting me be on.

[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.220]
Okay, please call us again.

[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.200]
I have a spare time.

[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.760]
Okay, Davey, hello.

[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.760]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:12.120]
Okay.

[00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.620]
Hi.

[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.700]
Listen, I was listening to WS News the other day right before the big change.

[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:17.180]
Yeah.

[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.560]
And where they were feeling the change.

[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.300]
And he made a big thing about the so far campaign

[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.280]
and how you were just pandering to your audience.

[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.800]
Oh, yeah.

[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.000]
And attempting to get rating.

[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.500]
Oh, it's helping to get ratings?

[00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.860]
Yeah, it's a really exciting thing.

[00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.180]
It's just what he said.

[00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.260]
And then, you know, right afterward, I almost couldn't believe this,

[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.400]
but I had to call you and let you know.

[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.020]
They have an interior design center over there that they do live spots for.

[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.120]
And he said that this interior design firm was like losing interest.

[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.200]
Oh, I heard that.

[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.720]
Oh, my God.

[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.420]
Am I glad you brought this up?

[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.520]
It's Miriam and Tyr ears.

[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.160]
And he said, please call him and tell him.

[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.700]
Call him, yes.

[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.700]
I was the most bushling thing I ever heard in my life.

[00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.400]
He's begging the audience to call him and tell him not to cancel their advert time.

[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.220]
It's exactly right.

[00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.240]
I'm Miriam and Tyr ears.

[00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.240]
I actually could not believe that.

[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.580]
I'm going to call you and let you know.

[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.360]
And the only thing I want for it is please a few seconds of a Craig Worthing imitation.

[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.120]
I love it.

[00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.420]
So we don't knock on this show.

[00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:07.300]
We only do positive.

[00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.340]
If Steve wants to come on this show and knock Neil, he'll have to go on with Alan.

[00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.680]
Do it.

[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.060]
We don't do that on this show.

[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.780]
I love it.

[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.920]
Have a good day.

[00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.380]
Am I glad that he brought that up because I heard it the other day.

[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.140]
I thought, wait a minute.

[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.380]
This can't really be going on.

[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.260]
He's during the live spot.

[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.400]
He's saying they're thinking of cancelling.

[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.200]
Please call him right now and he kept giving the number.

[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.420]
He says, even if you're not going to buy anything, call him and tell him to keep advertising

[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.220]
on a leaf-fowler show because I need the money.

[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.260]
He didn't say why.

[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:31.900]
They were thinking about cancelling.

[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:32.580]
Well, what do you think?

[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.880]
You know, there's only one reason that sponsors cancells.

[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.400]
No results.

[00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:37.660]
I didn't hear that.

[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.360]
No response.

[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.520]
Non-competes penis.

[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:42.980]
I mean, that's what it's all about, Lee.

[00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.420]
Okay, anyway, thank you very much for being here.

[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.380]
Please come back.

[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.940]
Thank you so much for the pleasure of your company and for your call.

[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.300]
I'll be here on the 16th.

[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:51.540]
I hope.

[00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:52.240]
Great.

[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:52.920]
That's good.

[00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.220]
We can get some coverage in that if the hero doesn't censor it.

[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.100]
Speaking of that, now listen, we've got something for-
