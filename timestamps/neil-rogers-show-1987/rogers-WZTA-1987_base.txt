[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.620]
He's got his head down on the table too. I can't believe it. Okay, a plantation. Hello. I'm Neil. How are you?

[00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:12.580]
It's slaves me how everybody in his brother is concerned with your show. Yeah, they're obsessed. They're obsessed.

[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:20.360]
Yes, and I watched last night of the news. There were some guys that was arrested for working with a

[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:27.120]
state agency that takes care of abused children and it turns out he's abusing them. Oh sure. Why doesn't Ellis

[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:33.740]
Rubin and all these other leading hearts go out and find protect these people that are children who that's that are actually getting you know

[00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:39.020]
Yeah, and why don't they go down to the Archdiocese and find out what some of these priests are doing with some of these altar boys

[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.880]
Why don't they check into that it was right on the front page of the Miami Heritage a couple of months ago

[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.600]
Big story about all this cover up about all his child molestation, but all they can do you know

[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.580]
We joke around about stuff on this show and I have a party at my house with a hundred kids everybody has a great time right away

[00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.760]
I'm a child molester. You know these people are sick sick and obsessed

[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.480]
That's true. You've got a great show. Don't let Rose were you?

[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.580]
Okay, and I have one question. Yeah

[00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.720]
Did you let big day come to your party as a matter of fact? Yes, he had a wonderful time

[00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.420]
You're more generous than he is that's for damn sure you got a great show. Thanks. Thanks a lot and he knows it

[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.440]
705 on Zeta 4 and

[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.620]
Right now, you know, I just wonder I think it back. I watched that thing last night

[00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.500]
It was so depressing and so morbid at letters home that Vietnam thing on HBO

[00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.120]
Mm-hmm

[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.260]
And I was thinking to myself they were showing all the protest marches and Kent state and all the things that were going on and

[00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.400]
You know was public opinion that finally brought an end to that slaughter

[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.520]
I mean we were you know that this Johnson and Nixon were sending kids over there to be butchered like sending cows to slaughter, okay?

[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.600]
And it was public opinion that finally finally brought it into that massacre that senseless insanity and I was thinking

[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.160]
I you know in this day and age when people are into this mercy this materialistic crap or all they care about is how much

[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.220]
You know they've got in terms of material possessions when human life means nothing

[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.680]
You know that could be going on forever because nobody gives a damn anymore about those things in this country

[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.980]
Good point and you know when it comes to free speech

[00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.480]
It's not you know whether you like it or you don't like if you don't like it turn it off

[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.880]
That's what makes it a great country. You've got a freedom of choice if you don't like a TV show turn it off

[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.900]
You don't like this show turn it off

[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.280]
But don't tell don't call up here and complain and tell me I can't say this and I can't do that

[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.920]
We can't talk about this and stand can't say this. That's a bunch of crap is what that is I

[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.800]
Mean if you want to live in Nazi Germany. I'm sure you know go down to Paraguay. I'm sure you'll have a good time down there

[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.700]
There are plenty of countries writing this hemisphere where you can go down to Cuba

[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.220]
Here we got all these people isn't that ironic in date County who are so anti-Commonista anti-Commonista and yet

[00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.380]
They're the first ones who want a censor somebody like me because they don't like what I'm saying because they have a different point of view

[00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.460]
So who the hell are they kidding?

[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.940]
Anyway, it's 707 on

[00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.160]
Your pontification station. Oh, what a wonderful day speaking of the pot of

That's Baker

[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:11.200]
There was a great, you know a Guido Sarducci. Uh-huh. They had a great thing on HBO the other day and it was fantastic

[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.500]
Where it was right everything that I've always said

[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.440]
Where they showed all these pictures of the Pope going here the Pope going there and talking and kissing all these dictators on the cheek and all this other stuff

[00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.740]
it was fantastic and

[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.200]
It talked about he was given the cold shoulder to

[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.760]
Somebody whether it was Noriego or or take a who'd ever to help was but then it showed the pictures where he was embracing

[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.600]
Arifat and he was

[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.840]
Kurt Waldheim and the shick in a hand of Ali aja Sheik or whatever the hell the guy's name was who

[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.520]
Try to assassinate him and Guido Sarducci says was on other words if you're not a communist you're a good guy

[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.820]
The Pope indeed

[00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.280]
And those fakers at the Catholic church who the hell are you people getting to huh?

[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.480]
All these people are starving that then the Pope is running around the world saying make a lot of babies, okay

[00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.640]
I most of these shows in this town like yesterday. We were on every show. How do you like that?

[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:45.840]

Long brain talking about the party about how do you know Sandy you weren't invited you dumb bitch

[00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:01.680]
Who the hell would invite a boring bitch like her, huh? We need a 60 cycle tongue. We got one on cart, okay?

[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:03.820]
That's you Sandy

[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:11.640]
four hours of terminal boredom for years putting the audience into a coma with a TV repair man and a collectibles guy

[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:17.440]
And all that other crap that you've been dumping on the public you ought to be ashamed of yourself you sick bitch

[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.740]
It's 713 on Zeta for and yeah, see

[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.760]
This is what I've been waiting for just the opportunity to awake again

[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:25.860]
See now they're in real trouble

[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.460]
I think they're gonna intimidate and they don't understand every time they do that. I just go crazy, okay?

[00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.180]
I was wondering before we went on the air

[00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.480]
Well, how's he gonna hand me?

[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.040]
Every time they try to intimidate me man

[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.300]
I just come back ten times as loud and strong as before because I'm not gonna take the crap from anybody

[00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.480]
Okay, from a bunch of jackasses

[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:47.500]
Especially our management jackasses you look like you could use a bagel or stand out there

[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.940]
You know stand is desperately trying to stay alive on a sinking ship over there

[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:55.680]
And he does an innovative show and has some fun with the audience and right away. Oh, can't do that anymore

[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.260]
You can't do this that mark killing man. He ought to be a bra

[00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:03.160]
He ought to be arrested for impersonating a human being that movie thing we did last night

[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.100]
I ran into you know because it was on Hollywood Beach

[00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:09.800]
We had a lot of tourists there and there was people as but from Boston in New York saying that a

[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.000]
Stern and lack of Darrow and BCN and Boston they get away with ten times

[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.900]
Of course they do we don't even come close to the stuff that they do we ought to be able to say any goddamn thing

[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.460]
We want this is supposed to be America not some kind of a fascist state

[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:47.900]

I'm back. Oh, yeah, I remember that

[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.940]
It's mr. Marie I know it

[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:53.940]
I know it I am right there. Let me tell you something most of the shows in this town are such

[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.860]
Cheap imitations and such crap and these people never original idea in their mind

[00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:03.440]
There isn't hardly anybody on here in this market except me or Stan who's got any balls at all and at phony and he

[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.760]
Afternoon over there on IOD who pretends to be mr. Controversy

[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.340]
But who keeps doing the same contrived crap over and over and over again

[00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:14.580]
He's been doing ever since the day he he fell into this town. You know he's about as

[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:16.820]
Vanilla ice cream John

[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:18.800]
Yeah

[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:25.840]
I have to think about the right work because I'm on here. Okay. How are these people exactly?

[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:31.000]
Scrum, you know, I mean I could think about words to say, but the hell it don't get you know

[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.340]
Don't get any blue skies just do it the hell with them forget about them

[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:42.680]
You know just drop them on your mind. That's what happened to Lenny Lenny get obsessed with the fact that these people

[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.780]
Didn't understand him now that you're totally wrong

[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:50.740]
I'm not obsessed with that. I've been fighting these bastards for years sir sir relax will you please?

[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.820]
I believe to hell with them. That's my philosophy and I go ahead and I do my thing

[00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:58.340]
And I'm gonna continue doing my thing and if they don't like it they can stick it near ear

[00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:01.860]
I and if the management that let me tell you if the management don't like it

[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:06.260]
They can stick it someplace else too because I'm sure I'll find somebody else who will like it a lot

[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.520]
Sir control yourself

[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:15.700]
Getting to hysterical I may I can't handle it. Okay getting apoplectic good intentions, but just losing it

[00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:22.060]
Okay, yeah 17 after seven on Zeta 4 your losing station and we have an open line in Broward to keep it close

[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:25.640]
They let's move right along because so far these calls have been really uplifting and like

[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.900]
Fuck you know like I mean really a lot of life and a lot of enthusiasm

[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:36.680]
North Miami. Hello. Hey Neil. Yes, sir. Okay, shoot. Are you a communist subversive?

[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:43.040]
Is that it? Oh, I want to know why you're always talking out against the government of the United States of America

[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:48.240]
There has to be more to it though in other words, communist subversive what I mean there's some other adjectives that have to go in there

[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:53.400]
Oh, you can't say it on the radio. Okay. Yes. I'm a communist pinko subversive

[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:58.880]
Limprister douchebag. Yeah, well don't come in our neighborhood. I'll drop you faster than a bad transmission

[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.400]
Okay, pal right

[00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:05.640]
Oh boy, I like that expression. He was brown bagging up this morning and it got to him a little bit

[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.200]
You know he was down there it you told him I'd drop you he was down

[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.340]
He was down there at you float them and that's a good expression. I'm gonna remember that

[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:19.520]
By the way, here's the garbage truck that just drove in which I think is very timely on the heels of that call

[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:23.760]
I said do a great job there this morning gentleman in the garbage truck

[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.360]
Unsung heroes here. Hey there they go

[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:31.920]
There you go big wave and then I'll wave it out to the garbage back at us. Come on pal

[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.920]
Be a good sport. Did you notice that guy said?

[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:39.720]
That you say things against the government and then the very next breath. He says I'm not allowed to say that on the air

[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.640]
Yeah, well, he likes fascism, you know

[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:45.820]
He's another one of those people who believes a little fascism is not a bad thing

[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:50.080]
Like like certain segment of our community in Dave County you believe that you know

[00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.660]
Little dictator ship can't be all bad as long as it's their dictator

[00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:00.840]
In and out and a book continues to show you know basically very little there

[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:05.660]
You know about a three which is embarrassing flat and you know he keeps talking about how much money he's making well

[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:12.840]
You know time goes by very quickly. It's amazing how life is and what's gonna happen after you know after he's sucked all the

[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.260]
All the milk out of the golden cow or whatever the hell it is

[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.000]
Well, that was an interesting

[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.180]
Yeah, that was

[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:26.500]
Yeah, that is something like Oprah Winfrey would do

[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:31.120]
I think she may have done that on several I think so maybe that explains why she looks like that

[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:36.160]
Well, isn't have a wonderful day. Don't let those other guys bother you. Okay. You take it easy now and have a great life

[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:41.040]
Okay, but it's before seven on say to four your suck the milk stage

[00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:43.380]
Milk sucking station

[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:50.600]
Milk is very bad for you by the way boys and girls so if your parents try to feed you milk

[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:54.280]
Splash it in their face. Okay, just say get get this out of here

[00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.720]
Spill it on the floor. I'm I'm serious

[00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.940]
In their face in their right in their face that'll get the message across okay

[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:05.580]
And then when it burns their eyes and it gets mung and that that coats their fate then I'll say wait a minute

[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:11.440]
This is garbage that I'm feeding my kid milk is bad for you. I don't drink it. Yeah, I haven't drank it in years

[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:17.540]
And look what it's done for me. I mean, you know humans are not supposed to be drinking the milk of other animals

[00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:22.660]
Okay, not only that, but it's all pasteurized anyway, and it's boiled and puke to you know what it is

[00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:27.300]
They all kinds of artificial crap into it. You know what milk actually is

[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:35.200]
Uh-oh. I don't like yeah something filthy is out of the direction we're headed here. I don't know why I just have

[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.720]

[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.940]

[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.500]
The animals mucus oh

[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:18.700]
I wonder why that maybe that's why it's a mucus forming food okay. Did that make a lot of sense to you?

[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:20.400]
It's the animal's mucus

[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:25.080]
