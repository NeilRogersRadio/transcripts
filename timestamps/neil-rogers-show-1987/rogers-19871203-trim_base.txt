[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440]
I can't believe this. Speak to me.

[00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.620]
Are you going to be there?

[00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:04.540]
No.

[00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:05.240]
No.

[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.380]
Well, I called last week and asked for the tickets and also about the restoration.

[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.140]
Yeah.

[00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.580]
No, you know, I'm not some snorer.

[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.140]
I like your show.

[00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.340]
I just, my mom wouldn't let me get tickets.

[00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.800]
I sure hope it's your phone that's messed up.

[00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.980]
For the level on this call, how is this possible again?

[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.180]
We locked the door.

[00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.360]
It's that Peter Bulger.

[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.580]
He keeps coming in here.

[00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.480]
And when he comes in here, everybody comes in here.

[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.880]
I'm practically yelling.

[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.020]
I know. We're supposed to be doing a talk show and your level is like almost disappeared.

[00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.420]
They got the RF out, all right?

[00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.720]
But they got the level out too.

[00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.280]
No, they're on night pattern.

[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.300]
That RF doesn't.

[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.300]
Oh, that's right. You're right.

[00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.780]
So they didn't even accomplish that.

[00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.540]
They just knocked the level down with nothing.

[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.960]
Are you depressed about that, sir?

[00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.020]
Yeah, I am.

[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.520]
Okay.

[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.860]
Will you play on the eruders to these?

[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.620]
Yes, I will.

[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.340]
Now, what did you say?

[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.900]
You said you won the South Florida masturbation contest.

[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.800]
Is that what you said?

[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.300]
No, I said I called about that.

[00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.720]
Well, what do you have to do to enter?

[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.320]
Now, I don't think we want to know the answer.

[00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.460]
It's after 6 a.m.

[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.040]
All right.

[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.560]
Okay.

[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.920]
But you keep working on it.

[00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.140]
You know that old saying, don't you?

[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.840]
What practice makes perfect?

[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:13.160]
Exactly.

[00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.180]
That's exactly the one.

[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.180]
A very bright young man.

[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.900]
Have a nice day.

[00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.280]
Okay.

[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.000]
Okay.

[00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.440]
Oh, what a good call to start off with.

[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.840]
Unfortunately, the level was disastrously low.

[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.580]
And one gets the sinking feeling that the technical incompetence of the Zeta 4

[00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.880]
Engineering staff is beginning to surface to rear its ugly head once again.

[00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.020]
Ladies and gentlemen, he was amazingly awake.

[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.960]
And well, that's because he's been busy.

[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.160]
It's 11 past 6 on Zeta 4.

[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.020]
Alan Box was a normal man with a wife, children, a summer home in Opalaka,

[00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.780]
and a chain of radio stations.

[00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.020]
Well, normal that is until just 3 weeks ago.

[00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.360]
Hi, honey.

[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.060]
How was your day?

[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:57.460]
Un...

[00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.060]
Believable.

[00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.540]
Terminal.

[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.720]
There's nothing but subhuman douchebags out there.

[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.320]
Alan Box is suffering from Neal Rogers disease.

[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.600]
Have you canceled the Miami Herald yet?

[00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.840]
But honey, we don't subscribe to the Herald.

[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.520]
Oh, now that's a cop out.

[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.160]
What kind of a lame excuse is that?

[00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.200]
Just say no to Elle Herald, sir.

[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.540]
Huh?

[00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.640]
People afflicted with Neal Rogers disease have lost the ability to communicate like normal human beings.

[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.040]
What's the matter with you?

[00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.340]
Blue-haired old bags from Fembroke Pines.

[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.380]
You know, the Yen Thes who say, all Neal, how can you say those nasty things?

[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.260]
Running around stealing sweet and low.

[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.420]
Can I get you anything?

[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.560]
How about those bag boys at Windixi?

[00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:37.780]
You know, it doesn't hurt to look.

[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.300]
In.

[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.540]
Credible.

[00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.980]
Neal Rogers disease, a growing South Florida epidemic.

[00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.740]
Please help us find a cure.

[00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.440]
Honey, it's Friday night.

[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.120]
You know what that means.

[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.860]
Hey, you know what I got?

[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.380]
A nine.

[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.180]
A nine.

[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.500]
What's Lephalor got?

[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.260]
Three points, something?

[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.820]
Send your tax deductible contributions today.

[00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.000]
It cares of hot 105.

[00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.580]
Terminal.

[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.960]
Un-

[00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.300]
Unbelievable.

[00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.800]
You know, this is the only station in America really.

[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.780]
On FM, I would think where actually somebody would call in like that and ask you to do something

[00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:07.560]
and you would do it.

[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:08.020]
Yeah.

[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.800]
Yeah.

[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:09.640]
Nobody else does that.

[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.800]
No.

[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.220]
They pretend that they do it.

[00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.180]
Even Stan doesn't do it.

[00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.520]
Just what he feels like.

[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.800]
Yeah.

[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.280]
Which is very rarely because he's usually in such a silly nasty mood.

[00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.900]
So I stopped by to say hi yesterday and you know, like you said, we do what we can.

[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.180]
And that was fun.

[00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.820]
Mm-hmm.

[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.700]
And I meant to tell him if he hadn't given those you two tickets to some twinkie, he would

[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.400]
have them.

[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.900]
And he's still.

[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.520]
What are you looking for?

[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.520]
I'm not looking for anything.

[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.860]
I'm not.

[00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.060]
Can I handle it over here?

[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.620]
I seem to be in full control.

[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.340]
I've done it.

[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.880]
You've seen.

[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.820]
Why do I wake every single time this morning?

[00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:44.380]
I'm listening.

[00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.260]
I can walk and chew gum at the same time.

[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.060]
Oh, I didn't know.

[00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.520]
You just seem a little distracted.

[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.000]
No, I'm not in the least, but there's something on your mind.

[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.040]
Well, there is something on my mind.

[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.180]
We have a topic for the show today, which is very rare.

[00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.260]
We usually don't do that.

[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.000]
Okay.

[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.440]
We do have a couple of deadlines open.

[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.060]
We haven't even given the damn numbers yet.

[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.400]
620 3600 and did that 620 3600 and did.

[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.820]
And in brown, it's 7779 3600.

[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.880]
We do have a topic in it.

[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:10.960]
Now, this is a good topic.

[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.320]
Like, you remember my roommate Dave?

[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.260]
You remember him vaguely?

[00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.460]
Well, he asked me a question last night when it came home from work.

[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.160]
And I think it's a pretty interesting question.

[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.080]
And I'm not certainly not the one to answer it for him.

[00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.280]
It's a little out of my league.

[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.780]
He said, where does someone my age, he's 18?

[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.820]
So where does someone meet young ladies here?

[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.080]
In other words, if you're out of school, where does one go?

[00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.680]
To meet attractive young ladies who are interested in friendship

[00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.560]
and whatever else, you know, goes along with that.

[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.000]
That is a tough question.

[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.140]
I can't answer it.

[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.020]
See, that's the one thing.

[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.180]
I like when I did that dating show about five years ago for a year

[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.060]
and was very successful when we married 37 couples.

[00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.400]
It was amazing the number of young people in the 18 to 25 age category

[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.860]
because you'd think those people wouldn't need to call a dating show.

[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.400]
But this area is a tough town for people of any age to meet.

[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.580]
I'm not talking about some bimbo, but I'm talking about somebody with a half

[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.040]
and IQ at least bigger than Gary Lawrence, you know, more than three.

[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.940]
Are you following that so far?

[00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.040]
Yes, I heard what you said.

[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.560]
Just a joke.

[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.780]
Gary is just fine.

[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.140]
Okay.

[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.120]
Where's a size six?

[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.880]
Single A?

[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.340]
It's very difficult.

[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.860]
It is.

[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.240]
So maybe the audience can give us some answers or maybe even some young ladies

[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.560]
who aren't already see it seems like all the attractive bright young ladies

[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.440]
are already taken.

[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.880]
Oh, yeah.

[00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.140]
Doesn't it seem that way?

[00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.480]
Well, there's a dire shortage of them.

[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.360]
But they are there.

[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.300]
They are round.

[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.720]
Yeah.

[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.600]
But they're at them out.

[00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:41.960]
We need to find out where they are.

[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:42.600]
Top to find them.

[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.860]
We need to get them up to the melting pot in Coral Springs

[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.300]
so that when they go to work,

[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.480]
some of those young ladies will come in and introduce themselves.

[00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.780]
I mean, here we're talking about a very nice looking, right,

[00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.300]
articulate young man, right?

[00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.580]
Yeah, but I thought this was a general thing of like ideas of where you could meet

[00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:00.700]
members of the opposite.

[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.140]
It is.

[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.660]
I'm not trolling for Dave.

[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.120]
If that, well, maybe we might be if he gets desperate enough.

[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.900]
But that's not the point.

[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:07.480]
The point is that it's a general question.

[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.080]
OK.

[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.300]
Are you getting defensive again?

[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.320]
Did I say something wrong?

[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.380]
I was just wanting some clarification.

[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:12.240]
Ruffled your feathers?

[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.700]
Well, it just sounded like when you said, you know, we need to get them up.

[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:16.580]
Look up.

[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.620]
There's a big bird that's a fun.

[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.920]
Come on, baby.

[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.400]
To the bird with me.

[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.520]
I've actually joy's not playing this.

[00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.540]
To the bird with me.

[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.400]
Come on, baby.

[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.700]
Fly your hands around.

[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.100]
You've been even doing sitting down.

[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.700]
To the bird with me.

[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:43.400]
To the shimmy shimmy.

[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.420]
I like her a lot, but maybe sharp.

[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.260]
To the bird with me.

[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.720]
Come on, we're going to twist the row.

[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.420]
OK, I bet you never thought you'd hear D.D.

[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.040]
Sharp this morning on Zeta 4, did you?

[00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.680]
When you woke up, of course not.

[00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.480]
And maybe we'll play Max Potato's little later on.

[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.460]
I heard that on tragic the other day.

[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:01.820]
Did you?

[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.320]
Yes, they I must confess they play good music.

[00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:04.920]
They really do.

[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.540]
We shouldn't say that about any other FM station

[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.760]
because we're not supposed to promote the competition,

[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.080]
but we don't BS you on this station.

[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.280]
You know, they do play good music.

[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.600]
You don't have to start ragging on them.

[00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.580]
I just because they've got some of those guys like Eric Branden

[00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:21.080]
on the area.

[00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:21.940]
You know, that's right.

[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:22.520]
Right.

[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:22.800]
Shake.

[00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:23.720]
He's my favorite.

[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.460]
Yeah, me too.

[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:24.680]
Yeah.

[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.000]
I like that sincere approach.

[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.960]
And your buddy Joe Johnson's on over there.

[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:29.760]
Joe's a good guy.

[00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.340]
Yeah, yeah, and Linda works there.

[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:32.460]
Linda's port.

[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:34.300]
Anybody else?

[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.180]
I mean, like are we giving the whole line up?

[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.240]
A lot of people we know.

[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.440]
I just say seven.

[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.380]
Well, a lot of people I know work at the powerless 96.

[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:41.780]

[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:42.160]
Really?

[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.760]
Well, we're going to be calling them a little bit later on this morning.

[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.820]
And hopefully we're going to get a better reception that we did yesterday.

[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.280]
Oh, rough day.

[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:49.780]
You know what I mean?

[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:51.440]
Well, the rough day on the phone gesture.

[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:51.720]
Yeah.

[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.640]
And then of course the reception we got from Mitch up at infinity broadcasting in New York,

[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.600]
sitting there somewhere somewhere close to the Howard Spurmshow.

[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.740]
I mean, come on, Mitch.

[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:02.780]
Cut us a break.

[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:03.380]
Would you please?

[00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.340]
Sounded like a typical New Yorker to me.

[00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.020]
Get real.

[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:06.640]
Well, yeah.

[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:11.620]
But it rubs off from Howard though, because Howard is really a jerk and no,

[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.600]
as much as I like his show, he's a goofball.

[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:14.780]
And he does it.

[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.040]
It's like it's him.

[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.160]
He's the whole world.

[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.020]
He's the whole broadcast industry in his mind.

[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:19.360]

[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:20.880]
And nobody needs anybody.

[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.420]
I do.

[00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:22.540]
Do you?

[00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:23.380]
What are you here out there?

[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:23.560]
What?

[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.100]
What is that?

[00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:25.100]
Dave rustling around.

[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.320]
rustling that we hear.

[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.800]
That's he he does have an attitude that everybody is talking about him in the business.

[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.060]
And like nobody else needs to be on the air, but Howard right now.

[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.820]
This is part of pretty interesting because outside of New York and Philly,

[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:37.960]
nobody can hear how right.

[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:42.560]
So it's a vast wasteland out there again, but he does think that and that is part

[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.160]
of the attitude we got from Mitch.

[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.060]
I think that's true.

[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:45.480]
Yeah.

[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.740]
That of course we were calling up to so about meeting these young ladies.

[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.400]
Oh, man, soon.

[00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.920]
It's meeting members of the opposite sex.

[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:55.660]
It right.

[00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:56.960]
Why if the opposite sex?

[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.080]
Are you discriminating now?

[00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.060]
No, but you know what?

[00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.620]
Why can't it be of the same sex?

[00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:01.300]
It can be.

[00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.360]
Why couldn't it be Jeff Stryker at Windixie?

[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.480]
Well, good luck to you.

[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:06.000]
No, I know.

[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:06.480]
I need it.

[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.860]
In fact, some of the bag boy, I got to tell you a horrible story.

[00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.020]
This is terrible to say.

[00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.560]
By the way, I want to say good morning.

[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.200]
I doubt that they're listening, but the two guys who, uh,

[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:19.380]
accosted me yesterday at right aid at the pharmacy when I was getting my prescriptions refilled.

[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:20.560]
Nice guys.

[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.200]
Although one of them has like this obsession with Joey hates him,

[00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:25.820]
but he doesn't stop talking about him.

[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.520]
And I worry about people like that.

[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:27.980]
Yeah.

[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:32.300]
Cause if he doesn't like his show, he ought to just listen here and quit listening to Joey like everybody else has.

[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:38.860]
But anyway, uh, in my Windixie, I was in there a few days ago and there was like a 92 year old guy is a bag boy.

[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.260]
Haven't you run it in before?

[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:41.920]
Not in my Windixie.

[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:48.480]
I think there's a dangerous trend starting that trend began a couple of years ago with older people.

[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:53.260]
And the rumor is that Sonny Rosenberg is seriously considering running his mayor of plantation.

[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:58.540]
So the median demographic may be zooming any moment up in my neck of the woods.

[00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.620]
I can't, I cannot deal.

[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.440]
And this poor guy was just like trembling.

[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:03.040]
Yeah.

[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:09.160]
In fact, maybe we ought to play silences golden by the tremolo and honor an honor of this bag boy because.

[00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:13.200]
I mean, he was such a bag boy like you wouldn't believe he could barely lift the bag.

[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.660]
Couldn't get the groceries in the sack.

[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.980]
I don't think bag boy, you can't get it in the sack anymore.

[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.600]
That's, that's the time to hang it up.

[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.220]
All right.

[00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.920]
620 now in Zeta 4.

[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.980]
Now you know ABC TV newsman Sam Donaldson.

[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:28.280]
Oh, one of my least favorites.

[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.360]
Yeah, what a jerky.

[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.660]
He's been known to get a little active once in a while.

[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:36.820]
But White House stenographer Deborah Bird has refused to comment on a New York post report.

[00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:44.560]
Deborah Bird has refused to comment on a post report that Donaldson bit her hand as she walked by him at a corridor,

[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.200]
breaking the skin in two places.

[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.940]
Here's the Beatles and I want to bite your hand on Zeta 4.

[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:55.900]
Paper also says the rabbit newsman bit White House staffer Joan Trump's on another occasion.

[00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.420]
Now we know why they talk about Sam's biting comments.

[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:07.900]
San Francisco Chronicle gives us no words on whether he was foaming at the mouth as usual.

[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:08.480]
Uh huh.

[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:16.280]
All right, Toronto singer actress Vivian Willis pleaded guilty to attempted extortion for having sex with a 72 year old man.

[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:20.280]
She met in a bar while accompanying a company, a company photograph.

[00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.240]
Uh, an accompanying photographer.

[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.180]
Let me, uh, an accountant.

[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.200]
I love this reading.

[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.960]
This is, this is like the old times now.

[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.640]
You're reading a photographer with a round.

[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.640]
The reform is this 620 news is a trip.

[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:38.040]
A photographer with their photograph, the action and then demanded $1,500 or else.

[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:42.640]
She'd show the photos around seven seven, some seventy two year old.

[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.720]
Spider-pater to show them around, but this guy was more modest.

[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.820]
He went with police.

[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:48.620]
To the bay with him.

[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:49.720]
To the bay with him.

[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:55.380]
Come on take me to the sky above the sky.

[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.160]
I'm gonna die.

[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:56.960]
I'm gonna die.

[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.500]
Let me see what's going on.

[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.680]
Baby baby, go to the ball and it's love.

[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.260]
He's drooling again now.

[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.040]
He's dribbling.

[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.820]
Who is fine to deal?

[00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.880]
He said you're Larry Bird imitation where you start dribbling all over the place.

[00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:08.580]
Yeah.

[00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:10.740]
Mostly sunny.

[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.400]
I have 72 today, low in the mid-thick.

[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:16.820]

One block west of the Palmeadow.

Okay, it's 23 past 6 on say to four here on a Thursday morning.

And this is the big day with you two concert.

[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.540]
And getting real now, getting serious.

[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:28.340]
We will be broadcasting live from the Orange Bull from the Bull.

[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.400]
And of course, there are a lot of people on the station who have been broadcasting from the Bull.

[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.840]
And you can tell just by listening to their shows.

[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.740]
Okay, now we actually are going to play a little you two later in the show.

[00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:43.980]
We don't want to overdo it because somebody we all know and love on the AM is obsessed with you two.

[00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.720]
And we played it the day you were out here a couple of thirties.

[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:47.420]
Was it last Thursday?

[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.500]
Played you two cut the other day.

[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:53.740]
In fact, we'll play that again today because that's really that's the definitive current cut from the Joshua tree, right?

[00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:55.000]
I still haven't found.

[00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:55.960]
Yeah, what I'm looking for.

[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.920]
What I'm looking for which brings us back to Windixie again.

[00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:58.720]
Oh, yeah.

[00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:03.980]
And you were starting to say before you sir rudely interrupted yourself with that award-winning newscast.

[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.580]
About there ought to be some way for people to find other people.

[00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:11.100]
Now public says those things on is it Tuesday nights?

[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:18.240]
I don't know, but they do have the single night to ten o'clock where you know single people are supposed to come in and browse through the meat department.

[00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:18.820]
Yes.

[00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:23.460]
And the fresh fruit and whatever else they can get their paws on and evidently it seems to work out.

[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:27.160]
Okay, I just have a feel now who just came in and dimmed their lights.

[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.120]
What the hell was that?

[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.020]
Is that Peter Bulger?

[00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:30.700]
Sneaking in.

[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.740]
Yeah, see he dimmed the lights.

[00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:33.540]
Do you believe that?

[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.000]
Look at that.

[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:34.800]
It's a little signal.

[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.020]
I can't believe it.

[00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:40.740]
He just, and why has he got that GTR bumper sticker on his car this morning?

[00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:42.600]
He trying to tell us something?

[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.840]
He is out of his mind.

[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:45.440]
Is that him?

[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:45.920]
No.

[00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:46.600]
Oh, it's not.

[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.100]
It's somebody else in his space.

[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:48.760]
Yes.

[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:49.500]
Terrific.

[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:49.980]
Okay.

[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:55.560]
Well, there's something really strange going on ladies and gentlemen and we'll let you know in a few minutes if it's time to call the police.

[00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:56.060]
Yeah.

[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:57.320]
625.

[00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:00.280]
Get your specimen jars ready and let's take another call.

[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:07.100]
Well, the reason I'm not like rushing to the phone is because the level and at first call are with so frightening that I don't want to get to Chris.

[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:08.520]

[00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:08.920]
Yeah.

[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.140]
Tony, Tony Prado's assistant.

[00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:13.360]
But Chris never parks there.

[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.760]
Chris always like parks over on the side.

[00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.000]
And Chris never comes in at this hour of the morning.

[00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:19.080]
I think you're dreaming.

[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:20.460]
Broward County, hello.

[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:22.060]
Hello.

[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.020]
I know that you're there.

[00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:24.680]
Trust me.

[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.840]
But they're not going to speak to us.

[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:27.180]
Okay.

[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:28.220]
Whatever you want.

[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:29.140]
Broward, hello.

[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:29.800]
Hello, Neil.

[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:30.420]
Yes, sir.

[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:31.120]
Wow.

[00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:32.920]
First time I was able to get through.

[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:37.620]
Boy, I must have been thankfulness that first call must have his phone must have been on the floor or something.

[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:38.600]
How's my L level?

[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:39.800]
Your levels are great.

[00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.260]
I'm not E.L.L. I'm not screaming.

[00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:42.260]
Now they're perfect, sir.

[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:43.300]
Oh, great.

[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.540]
At bloodshed, the lay is working fine.

[00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:46.080]
Great.

[00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:49.380]
I'm not going to listen to you on a phone and listen to the radio. It's really confusing.

[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:55.500]
I called to say there are a lot of people get up a lot of pretty early in the morning.

[00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.560]
I was up since five.

[00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:59.060]
Five this morning and four.

[00:15:59.200 --> 00:15:59.960]
Four this morning.

[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:00.680]
All right. Now what do you do?

[00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:02.260]
You work an early shift somewhere?

[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.800]
I do work for the Southern Bell.

[00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:06.240]
Oh, for the Southern Bell.

[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:06.720]
I'll pick up the moment.

[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:07.860]
Oh, you're out sick.

[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:08.520]
Well, that's good.

[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:10.240]
I'd be sick too if I worked for Southern Bell.

[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.140]
I'd have a guilty conscience.

[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:13.660]
No, I'm not guilty.

[00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:15.560]
I can't move my back too well.

[00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:16.140]
It went out.

[00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:16.800]
Really?

[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:17.440]
Yes.

[00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:20.580]
And how do I help my girlfriend get ready for her to go to work?

[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:21.860]
She has to be at work at six.

[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:22.760]
Uh-huh.

[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:23.380]
What does she do?

[00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:24.400]
She's an operator.

[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:26.100]
Southern Bell.

[00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:26.640]
Huh.

[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.060]
Kind of like an incestuous relationship, isn't it?

[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:29.540]
Oh, beautiful.

[00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:33.460]
So in other words, if you meet somebody on the job, that's a real good way to meet somebody, right?

[00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:34.220]
Oh, you can.

[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:34.740]
Yeah.

[00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:39.200]
A lot of people got married through Southern Bell meeting each other.

[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.260]
Hmm. So in other words, like reach out and touch someone should be our slogan for the show today.

[00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:44.580]
There you go. You got it.

[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.440]
Yeah. I keep trying, but they keep moving faster than I do.

[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:50.400]
I like that word.

[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.660]
One request that it's possible.

[00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:54.980]
Yeah, I'm sure I knew that you were going to ask for something.

[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.500]
I just had that feeling in my bones.

[00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:57.040]
Oh, okay.

[00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:03.080]
Don't let me after you played out of the song today with, uh, what do you call it?

[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.100]
Oh, about six, ten.

[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:05.480]
Six, ten?

[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.000]
No, that's W-I-O-D, sir.

[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:07.500]
Six, ten.

[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:08.480]
No, no, no, no.

[00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:11.500]
The one I want to hear is that baby Neil, uh, thing.

[00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:12.160]
Oh, baby Neil.

[00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:13.180]
Yeah, baby Neil.

[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:13.560]

[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:14.860]
Yeah. That's a biggie.

[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.260]
One of my favorites, baby Neil.

[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:16.920]
Yeah.

[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.320]
I call it little Neil.

[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:18.960]
Do you really?

[00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:19.700]
A little Neil?

[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:20.960]
That's what I call it, little Neil.

[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.000]
I'm sure you're going to get it with a chicken.

[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.520]
Yeah, I was just going to have payings.

[00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:27.880]
And I do mean little.

[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.400]
Okay, listen, we'll get down a little bit, okay?

[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:31.140]
It's a great show.

[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:31.940]
I enjoy it.

[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:32.760]
Thank you so much.

[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:33.000]
Oh, my god.

[00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.600]
Listen, uh, first time calling.

[00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:36.400]
Okay, keep punching those buttons, sir.

[00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:36.740]
They'll do.

[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.160]
Okay. Thanks a lot.

[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:42.340]
Okay, well, it's very reassuring to notice that the levels on these other calls are okay.

[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:43.500]
It was that first caller.

[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.540]
Of course, the phone was probably on the floor because he was busy.

[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:48.500]
Yeah, you're probably right.

[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:48.740]
Yeah.

[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:53.640]
And he was practicing for that tournament that he's going to be entering 27 past six on

[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.760]
Zeta on a Thursday morning.

[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.680]
And boy, the tension is really building, isn't it?

[00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:57.820]
You can just feel the tension.

[00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:59.840]
You can almost cut it with a knife or what?

[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.100]
As the you do.

[00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:05.140]
Oh, I mean, it's nice that they're here and all of that.

[00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:10.540]
But I get the feeling that some people get a little carried away with these events over

[00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:10.920]
react.

[00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:12.080]
Yeah, precisely.

[00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:13.720]
That was a good word over react.

[00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.380]
Get the hysterical, a pandemonium breaks loose, etc.

[00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:18.160]
Yeah.

[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:18.940]
How much you want to bet?

[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:23.780]
We aren't going to hear from any young ladies out there, any eligible young ladies, because

[00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:25.100]
we'd be wanting to take phone numbers.

[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:26.380]
We would.

[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:27.000]
Of course.

[00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:28.020]
Probably.

[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:28.600]
Probably come home.

[00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:29.620]
Pressure's few.

[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:30.600]
I would guess.

[00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:32.100]
Pressure's in few by climax.

[00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:33.420]
That's coming up next hour.

[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.660]
By the way, we ought to take a look at the playlist.

[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:36.920]
Shouldn't we be before we take any calls?

[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.500]
Captain Davis got home, I think.

[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.020]
I haven't seen Heidner, Harry Hem.

[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:41.460]
Let's see.

[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:42.480]
You got the doors.

[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:43.080]
That was correct.

[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:43.920]
Hello, I love you.

[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.420]
I'm no angel by Greg Alman.

[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.240]
I like that.

[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.560]
Bitch by the Rolling Stones.

[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.380]
Definitely not going to play bitch.

[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:50.140]
Can't play that.

[00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:51.980]
Black magic woman by Santana.

[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:53.440]
And I see that's another thing on the station.

[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.060]
They are Santana out, man.

[00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:55.700]
I'm telling you.

[00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:00.160]
Those two Santana records, Black magic woman and the evil ways.

[00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:00.640]
Yeah.

[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.120]
And that's meant over and over and over again.

[00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:06.580]
Valerie by Stevie Winwood.

[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:10.220]
See, now that's that's playable, even though we play it a lot, because it's at least

[00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:12.100]
somebody today wants to hear it again.

[00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:13.820]
Behind blue eyes by who?

[00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:14.660]
That's pretty good.

[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:16.020]
Spanish eyes by you too.

[00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:18.180]
We got all eyes songs today.

[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.780]
Dr. My Eyes by Jackson Brown.

[00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:22.060]
Yeah.

[00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:25.040]
For what it's worth by Buffalo Springfield, which is ridiculous.

[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:28.400]
I mean, it's a great record, but geez, why does he keep coming back to that?

[00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:29.880]
It's not the kind of record you play a lot.

[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:30.260]
No.

[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:31.960]
Are we talking about music again?

[00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:34.320]
Should I apologize for that?

[00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.060]
You see, let me say something, Stan.

[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.040]
I'll talk about whatever the hell I want to talk about.

[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:38.340]
Okay.

[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.760]
And as I look at the phone, every line is either lit or flashing.

[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:42.360]
Okay.

[00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:44.080]
So they're all lit up like a honnaque bush.

[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.560]
And it's 6.30 in the morning.

[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:45.940]
Okay.

[00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:47.480]
We have a lot of excuses.

[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.100]
We could say, well, we've got reasons why people aren't calling.

[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:51.500]
It's too early, but they are calling.

[00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:52.740]
Yeah.

[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.700]
They don't even have anything to give away.

[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:55.640]
Wow.

[00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.140]
It's in the way you use Eric Clapton.

[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.520]
I saw her standing there by the Beatles.

[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.620]
You belong to the city by Glen Frye.

[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:07.820]
Lovell find a way by Yes, which I think we've, it's a good record, but I think we've

[00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:12.780]
beaten that into the ground under my thumb by the stones and don't do me like that by Tom

[00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:13.120]
Petty.

[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.740]
There are some stuff in there that, you know, you might think about it.

[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:17.820]
I've seen worse music.

[00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:18.140]
Yeah.

[00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:18.660]
That's true.

[00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:20.060]
This is not the all time worse.

[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:20.320]
Yeah.

[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.360]
It certainly is not the all time best.

[00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:22.640]
Right.

[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:24.360]
Is it theater?

[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.940]
6.30 on the nose on Zeta 4.

[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:31.420]
And let's continue punching your buttons as they say on the dying AM up at the other end

[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:31.880]
of the building.

[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:36.640]
I don't want to say that the AM is dying, but I did see that Florida, mortuary was up

[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:40.280]
there taking measurements yesterday of the building of the studios.

[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:40.900]
I'm serious.

[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:45.240]
I do like those commercials they run though for funeral homes.

[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:45.420]
Yeah.

[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:48.540]
Well, right back to back with the arthritis spots.

[00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:52.020]
But this is a little something for our friends on the AM.

[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.200]
We don't want them to get upset.

[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.860]
Okay, let's take another call from Dade County.

[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:06.180]
Hello.

[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:07.640]
Neil Rogers.

[00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:08.280]
Yes.

[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:13.340]
According to the latest birch survey, you're not going to well.

[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:14.400]
Well, you know something.

[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:19.080]
The latest birch survey only covers September, October, you know, and it covers like the

[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.680]
first to the 15th of October.

[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:22.340]
And we weren't even on the air then.

[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:22.720]
Okay.

[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:23.820]
You jackass.

[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:25.940]
Sound like Joey's younger brother.

[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:26.160]
Did.

[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:26.580]
Didn't it?

[00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:27.360]
It's about 65.

[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:31.500]
According to the birch, even if we were doing well in the birch, we would laugh at it anyway.

[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:32.000]
Okay.

[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:33.100]
You idiot.

[00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.480]
I've been drinking too much birch beer.

[00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.500]
Thanks for going to get upset about the birch.

[00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.380]
That'll be the day when we get upset.

[00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:43.940]
Like back in the spring, when I had a nine in the arbitrage and birch gave me a two

[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:44.340]
something.

[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:45.460]
Yeah, that's birch.

[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:46.580]
That's Tom Birch, man.

[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.680]
He picks the numbers out of a hat.

[00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:51.680]
You're not doing too well, but you're listening.

[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.580]
I just found his monitoring, I guess.

[00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:57.580]
Another one of those 631, I'm saying before.

[00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:58.960]
Yeah, those monitors, man.

[00:21:59.140 --> 00:21:59.980]
It's like when you were in school.

[00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:01.280]
Didn't they have monitors in the hall?

[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:02.600]
It's the same.

[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:03.580]
Same principle.

[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:05.060]
Yeah.

[00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:05.420]
Principle.

[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:05.820]
Yeah.

[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:05.920]
Yeah.

[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.840]
As in the school, a couple of deadlines opened 620, 3600.

[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:13.520]
The good news is Captain Davis returned with his hurricane shirt.

[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:15.960]
I'd be embarrassed to wear that.

[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:20.220]
That's a baseball shirt, so that's okay, because I love the hurricane baseball team.

[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:22.820]
I thought it was something about storms or something.

[00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:23.640]
Yeah, you would.

[00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.400]
Mr. Sports over here.

[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:27.080]
Okay.

[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.400]
Where should we go next, Captain?

[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.720]
Dave, I guess the one line that's on hold would be a good idea.

[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:31.500]
That's in Broward.

[00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:31.780]
Hello.

[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:33.960]
Good morning.

[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:34.600]
Yes, sir.

[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:41.500]
One thing about that playlist, it's the same on every radio station down in this area.

[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.980]
And that's why we don't play any of it.

[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.700]
It's music is the pets.

[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:45.480]
I know it.

[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:49.880]
Listen to your friends Greg and Donald the other day and they're playing this Elton

[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.720]
John song that's out about Marilyn Monroe.

[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:52.340]
Oh, yeah.

[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.160]
It's a remake of an older song.

[00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:00.240]
And to the songs over, they start to tell everybody about all the other great songs

[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.000]
on the album and a yellow brick road.

[00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:05.800]
And they're both the name and all these songs that are great songs, but then they don't

[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:06.200]
play them.

[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:06.500]
Yeah.

[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:08.720]
It could be playing good songs, but they're not.

[00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.960]
Well, that's an interesting thing about this market.

[00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:14.140]
Most of the stations, as you say, they talk about the great records, but they never play

[00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:14.380]
them.

[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:19.180]
There's a station in San Francisco that plays, you know, different songs.

[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:23.300]
Instead of all the lead songs on the album, they play like a cut or two that are, you know,

[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:24.120]
back on the album.

[00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:25.920]
Yeah, obscure cuts, kind of like we do.

[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:26.160]
Yeah.

[00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:32.400]
I can see you're as thrilled as I am today about the Zeta live broadcast from the

[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:32.840]
Orange Bowl.

[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:33.700]
Well, I'm thrilled.

[00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:34.680]
I don't think is the word.

[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:39.160]
I think I am waiting with great anticipation, you know, like Carly Simon.

[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:42.560]
I'm wondering if they're going to get on the air what it's going to sound like, et cetera.

[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:46.920]
It'll probably sound like six million other cliches that you've heard.

[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.600]
I can't wait to hear Gene Cashman.

[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:53.000]
Miss Plastic talk about how great Bono is.

[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:57.680]
Where if Genesis was here, you could fill in the blank and put how great Phil Collins was

[00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:58.600]
or David Bowie.

[00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.040]
I mean, her.

[00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:01.080]
She is so plastic.

[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:01.720]
It's unbelievable.

[00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:04.160]
Well, of course, it's hard to grow here on plastic.

[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.120]
You don't understand that.

[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:06.860]
So there is a little contradiction there.

[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:11.260]
But it's what the chances of Stan Major doing a live remote from there.

[00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:11.940]
Well, he ought to.

[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:13.180]
He's so obsessed with you, too.

[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:16.440]
I think they're close second to Don Johnson in his heart right now.

[00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:17.880]
In fact, they may have passed it.

[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.360]
So that would be a good point.

[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.920]
At least you'd have some live people over there as opposed to in his studio where he can't

[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.360]
get arrested these days.

[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:29.300]
I think when he see if he see did he get his YouTube tickets, you know, I don't know.

[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:32.520]
That's so popular over there with the YouTube tickets is more than I can handle.

[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:37.040]
I think if he sees you to today, it'll be the first time he ever sees you to.

[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.240]
He talks about him like they're his heroes.

[00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:40.520]
Yeah, oh, yeah.

[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.980]
Well, he's trying to, you know, he's trying to relive a second childhood.

[00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:45.580]
And wait to see a 52 year old man.

[00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:48.200]
Eminete the orange.

[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.100]
Well, maybe they could joy over there, too.

[00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.820]
They could have a 72 year old man, Jan.

[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:55.720]
Speaking of Stan, I got a present from him yesterday.

[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:56.940]
I got my Pope.

[00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.880]
Was it the Pope tour t-shirt?

[00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:00.180]
Yeah.

[00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:02.620]
Well, how come you're ripping him if you got something for free from him?

[00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:05.360]
That's kind of a sour attitude, isn't it?

[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:06.460]
Yeah, I guess you're right.

[00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:06.820]
Yeah.

[00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:08.200]
I apologize to him.

[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:09.060]
No, I don't.

[00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:10.640]
Well, at least take it back.

[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:12.640]
Guess what I'm eating right now.

[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.500]
And it's not pornographic.

[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:15.220]
What a segue.

[00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:15.980]
A cheeseburger.

[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:16.460]
Wrong.

[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:17.520]
What is it?

[00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:18.000]
E.J.

[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:18.540]
Cinnamon.

[00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:19.580]
Oh, boy.

[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:20.680]
Are they great or what?

[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:21.460]
They're the best.

[00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:22.780]
They're just too good to be true.

[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:24.220]
Wormed it up into microwave.

[00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:25.580]
And it is great.

[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.720]
OK, nothing like warming it up into microwave.

[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:28.620]
That's what I always said.

[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:29.300]
Have a great day.

[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:30.120]
OK, you too.

[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:30.580]
You too.

[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:31.440]
He said it again.

[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.600]
6.35 on Zeta 4.

[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.360]
Now, what the hell are you doing this morning?

[00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:38.760]
Do you have me just like, let's play the wanderer by Dianne?

[00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.120]
The man is just totally out of control today.

[00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:42.500]
He is nowhere to be found.

[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:43.260]
Is this him?

[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:44.780]
Is what him?

[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:45.780]
This somebody said.

[00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:47.280]
Arthur Sonny Rosenberg.

[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:47.800]
That's him.

[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:48.580]
What about him?

[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.300]
Somebody said who the hell cares?

[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:52.760]
He wrote a thing to action line in the herald.

[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:54.620]
And we got to go through a whole big deal.

[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:59.920]
Four years ago, I paid $7,000 to have my bathroom completely

[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:00.660]
redone.

[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:03.600]
A plumbers says a new ballcock will fix it.

[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:04.120]
Oh, what?

[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:04.480]
Jeez.

[00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:06.260]
I got some great lines for that, son.

[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.400]
If anybody I know needs something.

[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:14.420]
What is a, how would you define a ballcock?

[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:16.780]
In other words, he's missing parts is what he's trying to say.

[00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:16.800]
I see.

[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:18.140]
For the bathroom.

[00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:19.540]
This is Arthur J.

[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:21.420]
Sonny Rosenberg in Hallendale.

[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:24.420]
I wrote three times and didn't get a reply.

[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.800]
That's something when you're the mayor of a city of Hallendale and you got a right to

[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:30.500]
action line about your ballcock and your toilet.

[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:32.820]
Oh, jeez, sonny.

[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.040]
He's all class, isn't he?

[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.260]
6.36 on Zeta 4.

[00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:36.640]
Let's see.

[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.380]
That's another, we just skip right on through and keep going.

[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:41.880]
And we have an open line in date at 6.2.0.

[00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:42.620]
3600.

[00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:45.860]
How much you want to bet nobody responds to our subject today?

[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:48.520]
Why should this show be different from any other day?

[00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:50.520]
Monestana Halala Hazez, they say.

[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:51.860]
Why is this?

[00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.320]
Well, I always say any different from any other morning.

[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:54.920]
Right.

[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:55.720]
They ask.

[00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:58.500]
That is a expression from a satir, I think.

[00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:01.420]
Why should today be any, I think.

[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:05.220]
What do you know becoming a Jewish expert, too, because you got that stupid book?

[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:07.920]
He's a sports expert this morning.

[00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:09.240]
He's an expert on Judaism.

[00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:12.880]
Next thing you'll be surpassing Rasta.

[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.060]
It's the kosher bird, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.880]
This morning is impersonating an empire kosher chicken.

[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.220]
Or is it K-POP?

[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.520]
It's K-POP.

[00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:33.640]
It's K-POP.

[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:34.560]
It's K-POP.

[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.460]
Come on, we are going on with the fly.

[00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:39.180]
Oh, yeah.

[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:41.480]
Shake your shot.

[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:44.100]
Yeah, work it on full beam.

[00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:46.300]
I'll hunt in your fire.

[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:47.800]
To the fire, to the fire.

[00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:50.820]
To the fire, to the fire.

[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.860]
To the fire, to the fire.

[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:53.840]
To the fire, to the fire.

[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:54.900]
I'll fucking roll.

[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.040]
Okay, do the nerd with D.D. Sharpe.

[00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:59.060]
Very possible.

[00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:01.680]
I could be breaking some new ground soon on Zeta 4.

[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.740]
That could hit the top 10 by the end of the show.

[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:04.580]
That's pretty good.

[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:05.960]
I like D.D. Sharpe a lot.

[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.520]
First doesn't fit with this format.

[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:08.800]
That's why you're playing.

[00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.260]
That's exactly why we're playing the trend.

[00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:12.340]
Try to break this format up a little bit.

[00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:13.820]
Broward County, good morning.

[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:15.320]
Hello.

[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:16.640]
What do we got?

[00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:18.140]
Another stiff on the phone and Broward?

[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:19.000]
He has no...

[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:19.580]
Where the hell is he?

[00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:20.660]
I mean, seriously.

[00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:22.400]
Yeah, speak to me.

[00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:23.500]
How you doing, now?

[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:23.940]
Okay.

[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.880]
The first time, Carl, I like to talk on your subject.

[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:26.640]
Okay.

[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.860]
My wife's not buffal right now.

[00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:31.440]
She went to her mother's grandmother died.

[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:31.980]
Yeah.

[00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:34.140]
I was thinking, maybe Stanley could buy the house.

[00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:35.580]
WKBW's got it open.

[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.520]
What does that have to do with our subject, sir?

[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.400]
I thought you were talking about Stanley.

[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.900]
22 before a 7 on Zeta 4.

[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.220]
The show is very confusing.

[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:47.040]
Yeah, it really is.

[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.600]
And especially when we keep looking in that control room

[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.840]
and the man is out of control,

[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:52.820]
I'm getting choked up just thinking about it.

[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:54.260]
What is he doing this morning?

[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:55.660]
You're going to have to ask him.

[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:57.840]
You cannot find this man anywhere.

[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.300]
Like, what if we wanted to play a record right now?

[00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:02.120]
Just for an example.

[00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:03.720]
Oh, well, you wouldn't be able to play.

[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.460]
I guess I would have to go running in there and play it.

[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:07.480]
Good luck on that.

[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.600]
I'd like to see you getting that board.

[00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:10.460]
There he is.

[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.580]
Oh, there's Captain Dave.

[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:12.400]
I remember him.

[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.300]
He used to work on a morning show on Zeta.

[00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:15.740]
Sorry.

[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:16.220]
Sorry.

[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:17.060]
Sorry for what?

[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:18.100]
What the hell are you doing?

[00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:19.440]
These phones are flashing.

[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:20.460]
Take it.

[00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:20.940]
Take it.

[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:21.020]
Take it.

[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:21.400]
Take it.

[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:21.680]
Take it.

[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:21.820]
Take it.

[00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:21.860]
Take it.

[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:21.980]
Take it.

[00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:22.060]
Take it.

[00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:22.060]

[00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:22.420]
Take it.

[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:23.900]
Here's BT-O on ZetaFork.

[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:24.540]
Get out of here.

[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:25.960]
Okay.

[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.340]
Let's try another one.

[00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:28.260]
David Coutty, hello.

[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:29.520]
No idea how you do it.

[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:29.900]
Okay.

[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:30.800]
Listen.

[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:33.480]
Tell Stan if it wants any Me II tickets.

[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:34.000]
Yeah.

[00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:36.220]
And they're going to be opening X for you two.

[00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:37.920]
Me II, you two?

[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:38.260]
Yeah.

[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:40.680]
And R2D2 would be closing it.

[00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:41.440]
Oh, kinda two.

[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:45.440]
Anyway, remember that song behind Blue Eyes?

[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:46.320]
Yes, I do.

[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:46.800]
By the hoof.

[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:50.720]
Remember the album cover that it was on is called Who's Next?

[00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:51.300]
No.

[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:52.060]
i don't remember that

[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:56.160]
i mean i sure if i saw that i would recognize it but uh... i'm not gonna lie to

[00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.600]
you say oh yeah i don't it doesn't ring any bells with me

[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.880]
i'll give you an idea because you know me i know nothing about music

[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:04.720]
it's a it's a big wall

[00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:08.300]
and there's four guys walking away from it

[00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:10.480]
and it seems to be something on the wall

[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.340]
and that's why it was called who's next

[00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:16.200]
i don't be too graphic on the station

[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.100]
icing as in the hand writings on the whole i see

[00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:20.120]
i got it

[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.480]
i may look at the cover okay well maybe we can get like a scratchy copy of the

[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.800]
record instead of playing it off cd we can play the record

[00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:33.000]
because i heard a lot of scratchy music on fm in this market lately i mean

[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.460]
really scratchy

[00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:37.000]

[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:09.040]
while you were talking i think oh there it goes they hung up the phone but they were laughing but you

[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:14.520]
were right i told oh i knew he'd get hung up on because uh he's got no i can't say got no balls

[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:19.440]
he's like uh gotless all of a sudden did i say to him yesterday he should really

[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:25.300]
i make a cause of this he's getting a lot of free publicity and there's absolutely no reason why

[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:31.200]
we can't all be friends in fact i was thinking of asking donald to cut a new card to replace it's

[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:37.180]
a good time for a good taste that's getting old where he just said hi Neil bye boy oh that'd be great

[00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:41.300]
oh that would be a classic we'd play it over and over again and give full credit where credit is

[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:45.260]
due they won't do it of course they won't do they won't even speak to us on the phone we're

[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:49.900]
competition oh yeah we're better hot competition and of course uh that shows you how paranoid

[00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:54.880]
oh they are gloves ninety four oh and if you listen to that show lately uh you've got they have

[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:59.140]
good reason to be now that paranoid would not be the accurate term paranoid means fear that is

[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:04.900]
unjustified you're right so that is not the right that is not the right word at all you think

[00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:09.000]
management is bad here and you do have some good points i think i think the phrase that we might

[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.460]
use is they are scared blankly yeah at least Gary Lawrence is jovial that's a jovial guy the

[00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:19.720]
management here is a breeze it's a breeze compared to the management at that oh yeah no gary's a good

[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:24.280]
guy he's uh you know not too bright but he's a good guy i like him personally i do i like him a lot

[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:29.180]
he just might his own business and he's hands off the show no he said yesterday as a matter of fact

[00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:34.740]
when i came into sign all his important important documents right he said um that everywhere he goes

[00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:39.040]
that people are talking about the show and everything is great and wonderful and all of that stuff same

[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:42.260]
with where i everywhere i get nervous when he says that because then i know we're doing something

[00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:48.540]
very wrong what he says have you got to talk about howlandale why can't you just be general why do

[00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:53.020]
you have to be when he says something like that then i know that's the time to really tear into it

[00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:57.900]
well just keep with your continuing philosophy that you have used successfully for years listen

[00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:02.960]
to management and do the opposite of what they say in your bond of six years now these guys you

[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:07.460]
just tried to talk to didn't they used to have like a bit they used to mention you on the air every

[00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:13.940]
day every day at eight fifty five the your i just did a big neo-rodger's theater and see then

[00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:18.240]
i was on a m saying that's at a different time and different times lot but now that we're on

[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:24.000]
fm and in the same time slot they are parent no they're not paranoid they're scared blankless yeah

[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.740]
yeah bleepless yeah it gloves 94 i think you're absolutely actually have no show to be honest with

[00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:34.020]
it they have absolutely no show at all non non radio people have told me that because i've never heard

[00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:38.980]
it i think i've heard like just a couple of seconds there there's no show and he plays like that

[00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:44.880]
three stu just thing over and over and over again and it was probably funny the first 400 times

[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:51.540]
he has the worst sidekick in not in radio in the history of the human race yeah radio is the worst

[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:57.540]
sidekick in history in human race that's a great tonto and even the cavemen had better sidekick

[00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:05.040]
so okay you got it even the Greeks had better side man has a perfect last name yeah agony it does

[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:10.120]
put me into agony when i hear that boy bet oh i'm not going to play the card i'm tempted to but

[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:15.720]
i'm not going to do it because i'm hurt my feelings are wounded call them active we extended the

[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:21.600]
hand of friendship and they chopped it off and how's john moron gonna know you well he'll hear

[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:26.840]
it on this air yeah what's that well i'm sure he listens he's monitoring us all you bet okay if

[00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:23.240]
he claims he's only forty

[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:26.300]

[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:43.100]
maybe the egg will come out of his shell

[00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:45.340]

[00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:48.180]
no neo-rodgers

[00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:50.320]

[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:51.260]
okay now listen

[00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:53.060]
listen carefully

[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:55.280]
hear those tones

[00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:58.300]
okay just we're adjusting our ears

[00:51:58.300 --> 00:51:59.060]
ladies and gentlemen

[00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:01.440]
listening to the four hundred cycle tone

[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.780]
listen to that one that's my favorite

[00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:04.940]
real high-pitch one

[00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:07.320]
that means it's almost time for the sandy patent show

[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:08.560]
when you hear that tone

[00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:10.640]
seven oh five on zeta four

[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:11.720]
are there any radio listings

[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:14.600]
i think the herald is like going out of the radio listing business

[00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:16.780]
now that they didn't replace Linda X Thornton

[00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:19.760]
and they have no radio columnist

[00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:24.140]
and it seems like the radio listings are rapidly disappearing to it

[00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:27.180]
could be because you're reading them on the air and making a mockery of them

[00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:28.140]
you think that's possible

[00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:29.260]
no okay

[00:52:57.600 --> 00:52:59.220]
you think flipper will show up

[00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:03.480]
i wonder if anybody knows his flipper still alive

[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:05.040]
wouldn't that be a good trivia question

[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:06.200]
all flippers dead

[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:08.640]
how do you know that

[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:11.000]
because i used to know someone who actually

[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.820]

[00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:15.260]

[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:21.420]

[00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:29.400]
but the real the original flipper is dead

[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:30.520]
you didn't know that

[00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:32.080]
and Luke Alpin is still alive though right

[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:33.040]

[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:56.340]
why are you making us out to be enemies when we're so much alike?

[00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:57.340]
we could have been cloned

[00:56:57.340 --> 00:56:59.960]
I know it well listen you're not my type Joey come on

[00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:02.440]

[00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:05.700]
Joey will you listen to me for a second please?

[00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:06.880]
let me ask you one question

[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:10.340]
okay I love it Joey I love being close to you

[00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:12.300]
did they make you take that asshole song off?

[00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:13.140]
yes they did

[00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:15.940]
well because the corporate people are assholes

[00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:17.460]
and they you know we're taking it personally

[00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:19.000]
it took my arm too yesterday

[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.000]
did they really?

[00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:23.820]
wait a minute ladies and gentlemen

[00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:27.380]
here's a major bullet and Joey lost his asshole yesterday on she

[00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:28.280]
I can't

[00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:29.540]
still with me

[00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:32.960]
and management meetings are going to cut us into one

[00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:38.960]
well I'll tell you those radio management people

[00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:41.200]
they're all cut out of the same mold aren't they?

[00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:45.320]
yeah me and I love you there's only one person in town who feels terrible about your move

[00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:46.340]
and who's that Joey?

[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:47.680]
man major he lost his ass

[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:50.800]
I know what is he going to get an act what's his story anyway

[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:54.580]
he's like the shadow I mean everything you do he does in our letter what is he Chinese food?

[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:58.720]
yesterday he got a great idea said he's going to start opening his mail on the air now

[00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:00.060]
wonder where he got that idea

[00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:04.200]
no matter what his publicity photos they are to use his death electrase I think they're a extractor

[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:07.700]
by the way Joey we got a call from Stan Roberts on the other line now

[00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:09.320]
Stan Roberts

[00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:14.540]
I know I'm going to throw names at you boy and Tom Shannon's waiting

[00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:15.720]
to as a matter of fact

[00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:19.840]
let's plug that guy who wrote the article about us in the top floor of the magazine

[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:22.180]
that's what I was trying to say when you kept interrupting me Joey

[00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:24.240]
his name is Logan maybe

[00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:25.260]

[00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:27.220]
how much pretty I am in you

[00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:29.460]
you're pretty good

[00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:34.120]
as a matter of fact I want to tell you something Joey I got you you know on your

[00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:36.140]
mortgage application

[00:58:36.140 --> 00:58:37.960]
yeah thanks for reading it on the areas guys

[00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:42.520]
I didn't give the address though I couldn't have done a lot worse but anyway I got your address and I'm going to tell you

[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:44.440]

I'm on over I love you there's only a new star 20 from for you to hang out

[00:58:48.460 --> 00:58:48.820]
Neil

[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:54.980]
you're on an AM station as a hero in my book you're like hey time is the quieting you got no problem with me

[00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:56.980]
exactly I always knew you were a good guy Joey

[00:58:56.980 --> 00:58:59.420]
I love you I'll see you soon bye bye bye

[00:58:59.420 --> 00:58:59.920]
bye bye

[00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:02.260]
oh that was a good call

[00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:06.440]
he was real nice that was an excellent call that was an award winning call Joey you're okay

[00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:08.840]
we're not going to plug those other thinkers from now on

[00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:11.560]
we'll call Joey every morning at least he's

[00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:16.020]
cordial yeah I mean see he understands it's just a radio show

[00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:20.040]
okay he doesn't really bear any personal animosity toward us

[00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:23.980]
I don't know do we bear any personal animosity toward him of course well

[00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:29.540]
no we don't I haven't even met Joey I haven't even when I was a little kid growing up

[00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:35.060]
I used to hear Joey on the air and he was about 40 yeah

[00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:41.320]
it's a matter of fact you're right and I always admired him and just worshiped the ground that he spat on you know

[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:45.080]
that was a 180 degree turn from the other folks I know

[00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:48.980]
well first about a half an hour ago if you're getting up a little late this morning folks

[00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:53.680]
uh we called as we always do our good friends we thought our good friend Greg and Donald

[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:56.860]
former and they were hostile and uh hung up

[00:59:56.860 --> 01:00:00.760]
they did the nervous laughter surface again but they were very hostile

[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:05.340]
and all of a sudden bingo that we were gone and I said you know that really hurts my feelings

[01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:07.420]
so somebody gave us the she hotline

[01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:11.480]
and I thought let's give it a shot because I know that Joey being the old pro

[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:15.720]
and I old is the definitive word that he is that we'd have a good time

[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:19.720]
and we did he actually got a couple of lines in there we got a couple of shots and it was great

[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:24.860]
now isn't it a thrill to talk to someone who you like sort of worshiped when you were a child

[01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:28.360]
when I was a little kid growing up kind of a mentor he was a role model to me

[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:31.980]
yeah yeah and when he got came in Hartford he was a role model

[01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:35.660]
and now it's just a joke Joey it's just a joke he's a good guy

[01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:39.860]
yes well he was sure nice on the phone yeah he uh we talked about Logan maybe

[01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:43.640]
and the article in South Florida by the way it's the uh December issue of South

[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.720]
Florida magazine for those of you groupies out there

[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:51.380]
and it's on page 44 and the uh article is called talking heads

[01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:57.580]
Neil Rogers and Joey Reynolds invade FM radio and we were just on together we just made radio

[01:00:57.580 --> 01:00:59.400]
history for right that's right all right

[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:03.600]
and Greg could have done yeah Greg we could have done the same thing with Greg

[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:07.080]
every day in the show in fact last week it seemed like we were having a pretty good time and they were

[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:10.520]
yuking it up and uh but that's it we're finished with them we got a new

[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:15.660]
what do you what do you think Gary Lawrence must think about oh my god see

[01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:20.040]
because we weren't on the air with him i know he was he must be playing a record

[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:23.780]
because we were not on their air but i don't care about that that doesn't phase me

[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:29.480]
is that bother you well um or you got to think about that one for a while

[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.660]
i was still thinking no no i was still thinking

[01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:34.720]
do we find the young ladies for uh some of our friends and that was a

[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:38.600]
difficult it's obviously so difficult that nobody's responded to it incredible response

[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:43.000]
i know it the phones are smoking i was still thinking about Gary Lawrence's reaction to

[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.900]
putting you know he's probably smoking right now after hearing the call yeah i was

[01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:49.340]
thinking that if he had any problems like captain david had last week

[01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:55.300]
that they're all sobbed now that's what in other words it's a moving experience i think that's

[01:01:55.300 --> 01:02:01.160]
what i'm trying to say would you agree with that i would think so yeah yeah in fact he's

[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:03.960]
probably doing the green apple quickstep even as we speak

[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:09.800]
i know this gets a nuts

[01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:21.620]
7.15 on zeta 4 the only station in america where we call the competition

[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:26.520]
and put them on the air because we're not insecure here we're not paranoid we're not insecure

[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:31.600]
and we know that when the results come in from the outlying districts from okchobie and

[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:36.840]
emokkali from keel argo and all those other wonderful places that we will prevail again

[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:41.840]
yeah that's not gonna take a little while but we'll do okay yeah i think so i think we'll be fine

[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:47.320]
we'll be just fine as they say in the aviary we do however have a couple of

[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:53.420]
deadlines that are suspiciously open that are vacant on the lines 620 3600

[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:58.720]
620 3600 if there's anybody else that's got the inside line at any of the other stations we got to

[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:04.160]
get tanner's line two because tanner would not get paranoid tanner's a great guy and a good friend

[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.380]
yesterday and i've learned i don't return his calls okay i don't want anything to do with him he's

[01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:55.360]
among brain he's an idiot he manufactures news that doesn't exist and of course all of these

[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:59.880]
myriad of investigations that are going on of this show you know there ought to be an investigation

[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:04.580]
of you buddy like where the hell did you come from talk about picking somebody up on the side of

[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:12.380]

[01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:35.900]
a record we'll play a you two little later to pacify management but uh... that's probably going

[01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:41.300]
to be about it and as far as all the stuff that we dropped now we did drop uh... penis envy right

[01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:47.340]
that's a little about the other some can relate to it but or maybe he can relate to it maybe that's

[01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:53.880]
what the problem was up in portland i've got nothing to stop and think about it that could be the problem

[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:59.280]

[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:28.500]
clean up our act and you know buddy i'm telling you you just manufacture crap out of thin air out of his

[01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:33.500]
little brain there now where did he get this that may have to play more rock music where did he get this

[01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:38.240]
you know why he thinks that because like the day before thanksgiving we played a lot of music and

[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:42.320]
thanksgiving day we played almost all music and i said we were going to do that right that was your

[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:47.180]
decision yeah and we did it because we felt like it not because we had any edict to play a lot of

[01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:53.160]
music you jackass buddy nevin's okay want everybody in the audience no seriously i want everybody in

[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:57.200]

[01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:02.980]
number a little later okay yeah and asking what his story is you know what his problem is he keeps

[01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:08.180]
making things up this whole paper is like that well no well they don't have room for a lot of news

[01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:12.100]
because they have all that advertising don't ever believe anything you read the sunsend

[01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:18.880]
okay now what time does that spot run the captain day okay 27 past seven you do realize they're

[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:23.500]
an advertiser on the show you do understand that i know that what did you just say that you like

[01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:27.840]
the paper a lot yeah love it okay i thought you said we read it first oh here he is i mean like we

[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:33.520]
can really afford okay where are we going next uh so we can shut him up i had one one yeah Neil

[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:40.020]
yes sir no i've been on the hold right 45 minutes well i'm sorry about that you know i get emotional

[01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:46.180]
well i know uh listen i just i just want to bend my flame a little bit on a a subject matter that's

[01:12:46.180 --> 01:12:52.260]
been troubling me for a couple days now okay uh listen i want to know how come out of the three

[01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:59.740]
a r station yes sir uh you guys classify yourself as playing rock and roll okay uh what do you all

[01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:03.740]
consider rock and roll well that and i see you yes the wrong guy that because that really gets me

[01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:08.200]
very irritated that i don't want to get irritated no no listen listen to me not letting me finish

[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:13.280]
you're not getting me irritated it irritates me that these kids today think that they have the

[01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:20.820]
the corner on what they call rock and roll so for example when she when a or some years ago

[01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:24.840]
that was supposed to be in fact you've seen it but their bumper sticker still says she is only

[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:29.920]
rock and roll over the health center or she used to be only rock and roll right and uh you know

[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:36.520]
that's the definitive rock and roll to me rock and roll can be Elvis Presley and um uh uh uh

[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:43.400]
fat stomino and bill hailey right rock and roll is like anything since 1954 that isn't like uh

[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:49.020]
you know barbara stris and a Neil diamond what about that fun uh these guys play uh i got my

[01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:54.080]
mind set on you now that that's really a stupid song no it's not a stupid song it's a great record

[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:58.260]
it's a good record but the song really like what what you just said is blasphemous sir that's one

[01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:02.540]
of the greatest records in the history of music okay well i mean i want to know something the lyrics

[01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:06.460]
aren't all that great but it's just it's an infectious record it's great it's a fun record

[01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:11.300]
it sounds like the old days it's for the people who want to reminisce about oh can you remember that

[01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:16.980]
tune no it's not no they play it on MTV yeah what's wrong with TV eight nothing either but listen

[01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:22.240]

[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:27.820]
rock and roll why don't you define it for us rock and roll yeah you want it okay well it's in a

[01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:32.200]
difficult question sir okay i'll tell you what your playlist of rock and roll no i don't want

[01:14:55.980 --> 01:15:02.820]
Boston is like a bubble gum almost you see Boston is bubble gum compared to rip that i got

[01:15:02.820 --> 01:15:08.180]

[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:31.600]

[01:16:54.820 --> 01:17:00.580]

[01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:04.640]
for it sir there's no audience for it okay it's narrow one percent yeah one percent you can't

[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:09.400]
make a format that's that narrow all right right okay so why don't you pick up that one percent from

[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:13.640]
twelve to one in the in the morning so in other words throughout the other ninety nine percent is

[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:18.440]
in it well i mean how how many nine ninety nine percent of the people i mean if i think what you

[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:23.220]
want is obscure cuts and listen no station in america plays more obscure cuts than we do between

[01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:52.900]
she's decent mm-hmm well i think he wants some more specific advice than that you know like

[01:26:52.900 --> 01:26:59.520]
saying anywhere is like saying you're on your own well if really if you open your eyes and look

[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:04.460]
you can really find well no i don't think the problem is seeing i think the problem is approaching

[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:11.880]
okay go to the malls mm-hmm making the rest um the left on areas and you hang out you're trolling

[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:17.620]
the mall no you just have a soda or something you have to watch for single girls yeah and then what do

[01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:23.480]
you do and you just go up to home and talk to them you'd be surprised a lot of them really don't

[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:28.040]
get offended really yeah and the ones who do get offended they don't slap that hard anyway right

[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:35.580]
no so she's saying they're everywhere yeah see i couldn't uh for example for me

[01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:41.520]
i couldn't go into the mall and see somebody sitting alone and go up and approach them and uh oh

[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:46.320]
jeez were you said you were a person i'm an old i'm an old man yeah that no that's true i guess

[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:52.060]
if i were the same age as the yeah i would go up to you and approach you really well i like all the

[01:27:52.060 --> 01:28:00.580]
people but no not not today Brenda oh nice trying to pick you up for anything yeah now now what

[01:28:00.580 --> 01:28:07.000]
i would do personally i would go to like say a Walton bookstore oh yeah see someone in a bookstore

[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:13.420]
you know oh yeah they have some psychology department exactly here over the book like that guy

[01:28:13.420 --> 01:28:18.460]
that called us and yeah yeah and all of a sudden these young ladies will be making gaga eyes

[01:28:19.180 --> 01:28:22.620]
and before you know it right over the drama and fine arts section

[01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:28.840]
but also like it little like restaurants like red lobster

[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:36.340]
like that in the bar area but he's on the 18 yeah oh see that's a problem in florida i mean a lot of

[01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:40.760]
other states if you're under age you can't meet people in bars because you can't go there right

[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:47.380]
my problem is that it's finding a person that likes you for who you are in florida right everybody

[01:28:47.380 --> 01:28:51.960]
likes you because you have money or look well a lot of plastic people here yeah

[01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:54.800]
insin seer is the operative word for florida
