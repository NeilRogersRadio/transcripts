[00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:03.780]
I'm sorry.

[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.660]
Even he made it on there.

[00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.980]
Well, congratulations, Frank.

[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.200]
You're a great American, and what can I say?

[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.140]
Well, those are little bonus numbers for you today.

[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.080]
Please, in general, you won't get those anywhere else you're found.

[00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.120]
The world is a better place.

[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.600]
And probably not to left a tissue ball on this show again.

[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.580]
Boy, those are good.

[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.100]
Those are some of my favorites.

[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.760]
You did have a lot of important things.

[00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.160]
I told you that.

[00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:29.900]
You didn't believe me.

[00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.880]
I think that I just come in.

[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.780]
I roll in here Saturday, expecting for you to be here like a clutch.

[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.000]
Well, you don't expect you to be here on Saturday.

[00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.140]
OK, I was wrong.

[00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:38.340]
By wild.

[00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.340]
About making fun of you.

[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.520]

[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.140]
That you really had nothing to do this hour.

[00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.700]
I was wrong.

[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.760]
We have a lot to do.

[00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:44.600]
And I still have...

[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.640]
I don't care.

[00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.220]
You know, this business about what like nature takes care of it and you're not attracted.

[00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.320]
That's a lot of garbage.

[00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.220]
I mean, if you're a virile heterosexual male, which is something I don't know much about,

[00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:01.640]
but if you were and you had an attractive, you were like 17 and you had a beautiful 16-year-old sister

[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.220]
with big breasts and hard nipples and whatever else it is that they get all excited about.

[00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.120]
I'm sorry, but you probably would, you know, like peek in the room.

[00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.500]
No.

[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.440]
No.

[00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.540]
Kyle says no.

[00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.960]
You wouldn't be in the least bit interested because it's just like nature, you know, protects you.

[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.820]
There's a psychological barrier.

[00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.780]
And from the time you're born, you know that this is a no-no.

[00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.360]
I don't know.

[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.340]
However, if you have a 17-year-old brother, that's terrible.

[00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.540]
Wait, is there a message?

[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.220]
There's a message coming on the screen.

[00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.820]
When you grow up with somebody, you are...

[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.140]
Yeah.

[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.280]
So bored.

[00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.760]
Yeah, you know, with them.

[00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:45.840]
Yeah, you don't like them.

[00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.860]
That is a good point.

[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.080]
You know.

[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.220]
Yeah.

[00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.020]
Well, they did...

[00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.580]
I forgot to tell them now in the Blue Lagoon.

[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.820]
Of course, they were there alone.

[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.260]
Different.

[00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.380]
That's different.

[00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.080]
And in Paradise, they forgot to tell your girlfriend that.

[00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.600]
That's right.

[00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.380]
Well, he aims to.

[00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.780]

[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.160]
Yeah, that's exactly right.

[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.460]
That's different.

[00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.620]
That's a different situation.

[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.820]
That's why everyone loved those movies so much.

[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:08.160]
And they...

[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.120]
No, that's not why everyone loved this so much.

[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.520]
It is a lot of skin in those movies.

[00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.800]
Well, that's the only reason anybody could have loved the movies because they were both pathetic.

[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.240]
They were dumb.

[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.160]
Blue Lagoon.

[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.800]
I do have six copies of Blue Lagoon.

[00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.360]
I would like to borrow one.

[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.120]
That was a giant, unbelievable smash at the box office.

[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.420]
Of course, because everybody wanted to see Brook Shields and Chris Atkins naked.

[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.980]
Which we did get to see him naked in the water.

[00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.360]
Yeah.

[00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.240]
And believe me, he made Blue in the box look like giant.

[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.000]
It was a Paris.

[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.580]
That's right.

[00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.480]
I'm not serious about that.

[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.480]
And it's the same thing with Paradise, which is also a giant hit.

[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.700]
It reminds me of all those speaking of giant, all the scabbage about James Dean.

[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.120]
Okay.

[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.740]
Okay.

[00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.480]
James Dean A was ugly.

[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.940]
Okay.

[00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.700]
Trust me.

[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.480]
He was ugly.

[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.580]
And B, he smelled bad.

[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.900]
I mean, everything you read about him, the guy never got...

[00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.880]
He was kind of like a early day rick waiver.

[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.340]
You know what I mean?

[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.020]
He never got near a bar of coast.

[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.120]
He never saw Irish springer.

[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.700]
And he smelled terrible.

[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.180]
His hygiene was...

[00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.260]
He was a scuzz.

[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.480]
And he was also...

[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.100]
He was into like SNM.

[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.500]
And it would burn cigarette holes in his...

[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.200]
I don't really get into any of that.

[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.620]
I don't understand people who want to have somebody put out their cigarette on your chest.

[00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.020]
You know, I don't know what that's all about.

[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.920]
Especially women.

[00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.200]
But speaking of SNM...

[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.120]
It's a myth.

[00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.220]
The whole thing is a myth.

[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.140]
What about SNM?

[00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.300]
I heard another one of those weird radio rumors yesterday.

[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.880]
Really?

[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.280]
About one of our...

[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.100]
I received it for this late into the show.

[00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.280]
How when you mentioned SNM it popped into my life.

[00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.380]
And I can't believe...

[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.900]
I don't even know if I should get into this at all.

[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.620]
But I'm sure you'll force your zero-oil.

[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.200]
I always do.

[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.800]
Like the story about...

[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.140]
Mike Miller being a matriety at stake in shake.

[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.160]
In same peak.

[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.880]
Well, you worked with this guy.

[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.720]
So I wondered if you could shed any light on this.

[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.800]
I heard...

[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.800]
Jerry Wichner of all people...

[00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.720]
Is a little kinky.

[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.440]
You worked with this man, didn't you?

[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.200]
I heard...

[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.160]
I just before you continued the story has a very big 357 magnum.

[00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.520]
I know.

[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.340]
I was with him at all times.

[00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.060]
That's why I should not continue with this story at all.

[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.600]
Whatever you want.

[00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.300]
I heard he...

[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.440]
Dallys with...

[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.020]
Oh.

[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.200]
Don't say it.

[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.920]
Not on my show.

[00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.100]
Say it on somebody else's show.

[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.360]
If you want to do Slander do it on somebody else's show.

[00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.620]
Exactly.

[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.200]
That's why I'm going to stop right now.

[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.240]
But I just wondered if you...

[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.180]
Dallys with...

[00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.900]
Don't say it.

[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.380]
I'm not.

[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:29.520]
Write it out.

[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.920]
Write it on that paper.

[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.460]
Just what we were talking about.

[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.480]
Oh, I see.

[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.860]
Yeah.

[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:37.720]
Well, who cares?

[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.180]
Well, I just wondered if you had heard that.

[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.100]
Because you worked with...

[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.920]
I mean, even Old Rover won't roll over for him.

[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.500]
I mean, you know, I think we've gone farther than we should have with that already.

[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.280]
But we're not interested in people's private life.

[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.640]
Good.

[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.040]
Okay.

[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.840]
We don't want to stick our noses in this.

[00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.100]
Well, it's just basically his private life.

[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.520]
Such a bizarre rumor.

[00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.720]
Yeah.

[00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.760]
If it would have been Jason Gidrich's private life, then we want to...

[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.940]
Pull still on the right...

[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.940]

[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:02.060]
Right.

[00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.740]
Exactly.

[00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.840]
Then we might have talked about it in a great way.

[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.240]
We'd better just back out of it.

[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.080]
How great length we don't know.

[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.040]
I think we'd just back out of that whole situation.

[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.520]
I'm grateful.

[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.660]
Sorry, I brought it up.

[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.880]
I apologize to the audience.

[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.800]
Well, you ought to apologize to Jerry.

[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.920]
I do.

[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.340]
His wig might change to purple if you...

[00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.080]
Although it already is purple, so I just...

[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.760]
Broward, hello.

[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.140]
Yeah.

[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.680]
Yeah.

[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.860]
Let me ask you something.

[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:36.320]
Why is Stan going through these desperate topics like hot pursuit and things like that?

[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.060]
He's shooting for about a one-two rating.

[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.060]
That was a good show.

[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.260]
Oh, come on.

[00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:42.100]
No one cares.

[00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.300]
Well, I didn't listen to him.

[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.960]
What was a good show?

[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.260]
No one did except a bunch of winding cops.

[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.100]
Yeah, well, a cop's in the pigs.

[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.680]
I couldn't believe he was so...

[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.840]
No, he was a little hostile with a couple of the cops coming to those pigs.

[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.820]
Well, I don't dislike all police, but most of them are pigs.

[00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.340]
Oh, yeah, they're ego trips.

[00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.480]
Yeah, the pigs.

[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.640]
I think he's just playing up to you.

[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.340]
You said he was real conservative.

[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.160]
I think he's doing his cop bashing.

[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.060]
He's called just to play up to you.

[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.140]
And it just doesn't work, you know?

[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.700]
You think so?

[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.160]
Yeah.

[00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:10.680]
Waste of time.

[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.980]
Well, maybe he can do another John Broward type show.

[00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.500]
Exactly.

[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:15.000]
Yeah.

[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.040]
But he can talk about Nick Raghwath.

[00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.160]
Just stuff on insist and mutual masturbation.

[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.500]
Yeah, that would be more exciting.

[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.560]
Now, do you have any sisters?

[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.360]
No.

[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.520]
Brothers.

[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.340]
Yeah.

[00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:27.540]
Two.

[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.080]
Two brothers who are older?

[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:29.740]
Younger.

[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.400]
Younger.

[00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:31.740]
How much younger?

[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.700]
Three years.

[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:33.800]
And two.

[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.000]
And you're old?

[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.060]
34.

[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.800]
34.

[00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.120]
But you've got a good memory.

[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.820]
Now, huh?

[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:40.480]
Thank you.

[00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.140]
No, I mean, give me a compliment.

[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.380]
Now, when you were younger, you and your brothers certainly never did anything.

[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.400]
No, no.

[00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.100]
No, no.

[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:50.900]
No, not at all.

[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.680]
You and your cousins.

[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.780]
Well, cousins, perhaps, yeah.

[00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.320]
Really?

[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.060]
Oh, yeah.

[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.500]
Little red-headed cousin named Kathy.

[00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:58.720]
Uh-huh.

[00:06:59.380 --> 00:06:59.900]
Unbelievable.

[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.040]
She was hot.

[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:01.580]
Oh.

[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.540]
Was she hot?

[00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:03.340]
Uh-huh.

[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:03.900]
Was she?

[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:04.880]
14 years.

[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.840]
She was 14?

[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:07.440]
Yeah.

[00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.520]
No, he said this went on for 14 years.

[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:09.940]
No, no.

[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.180]
She was six to the time she was 20.

[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.700]
She was hot some day one.

[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:14.480]
Are you serious?

[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:14.800]
Oh.

[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:15.660]

[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.740]
Well, without getting too graphic, because it's a family show, and the FCC is monitoring.

[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.660]
Uh-huh.

[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:21.080]
Right here.

[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:21.680]
Huh?

[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.180]
All I have to say is red hair.

[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.120]
Well, I don't like red hair.

[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.700]
In fact, red hair, I hate to say this because I love that I don't like people with red hair,

[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:32.080]
but in terms of being attractive to me, red hair is an incredible turnoff.

[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.620]
I mean, I just, I get physically ill, you know, when I think about it, but, you know, to each his own.

[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.940]
Oh, my, I wish, you know, with, uh-uh.

[00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.200]
Oh, that explains it.

[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.780]
Now, you and your cousins, she was 14.

[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.300]
You were how old?

[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:46.700]
I was 16, 16, and what is it that you were doing without getting, you know, used some...

[00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:48.600]
This is a special term.

[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:49.900]
She was a little discreet in here.

[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:52.740]
Um...

[00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:54.700]
So, I guess you'd call it, uh...

[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.120]
Familiar copulation.

[00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:58.820]
Oh, my God.

[00:07:58.900 --> 00:07:59.080]
Ooh.

[00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:00.020]
Wow.

[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.860]
She was a, she was a first cousin, too.

[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.840]
A first cousin, and you do understand that...

[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:05.180]
Uh...

[00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:05.880]
Mangle, I know.

[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.020]
Yeah, there's some harp.

[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.900]
In fact, the whole city of Nashville is a result of that kind of relationships.

[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.020]
Yeah, but I think she was a Mangle, right?

[00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.100]
So I don't think there's a problem.

[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:13.720]
Oh, I see.

[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:15.140]
So, yeah.

[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:16.440]
No, in the next generation.

[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:16.960]

[00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.560]
No, seriously, in other words, she was really hot.

[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:20.160]
Yeah.

[00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:21.560]
And so were you.

[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.100]
Uh-huh.

[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.260]
And how long did this go on?

[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.520]
Uh-huh.

[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.500]
15, 20 minutes?

[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:27.340]
No, no.

[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:27.660]
No, no.

[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.080]
Uh-huh.

[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:32.840]
Uh-huh.

[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.280]
Uh-huh.

[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:34.760]
Uh-huh.

[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:38.460]
Yeah.

[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.120]
No four play tonight.

[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.740]
15 or 20 minutes.

[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.380]
What a romance.

[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:43.780]
What?

[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:45.200]
No, I don't mean, uh...

[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:45.900]
No, no, no.

[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:46.560]
How long?

[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.640]
Another month, years, week...

[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.680]
You're taking two Kalamazoo shortly, yes.

[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.500]
Oh, I was like it was like one time.

[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:54.020]
Oh, yeah.

[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:55.160]
Only once.

[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.140]
Just one time, but you still remember it.

[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:57.880]
Oh, I've been in love.

[00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:58.940]
It was fabulous.

[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.200]
He remembers it vividly.

[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.200]
Was she the best you ever had?

[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:03.680]
To that point.

[00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:04.560]
To that point.

[00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:04.820]

[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:05.040]
Yeah.

[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.040]
Now, she was till his brother came along.

[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.840]
Well, there was a certain, you know,

[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.220]
the incest angle really adds a little excitement.

[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:12.800]
Oh, sure.

[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.240]
Everything's exciting at 16.

[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:14.820]
Oh, yeah.

[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:15.460]
Yeah.

[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.420]
So once again, we have found Stana a show.

[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.640]
He's all set now.

[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:23.660]
No, you're right.

[00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:24.420]
The population.

[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:25.920]
This is a great topic.

[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:26.600]
It really is.

[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.600]
Unfortunately, most people are unlike you.

[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:29.860]
And I commend you on your honesty,

[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:33.640]
but most people are just, I don't know whether it's social stigma

[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.660]
or what it is, but they just are too embarrassed

[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:36.860]
to admit those things.

[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:37.360]
Yeah.

[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:38.420]
Yeah, it's right.

[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:39.020]
It's just right.

[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:39.400]
Certainly.

[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.700]
It's right to do it.

[00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.540]
But I don't think I'd actually follow through an

[00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:43.700]
act.

[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:44.380]
All right.

[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.940]
Now, let's say you were 16 and this 14-year-old cousin,

[00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.180]
and instead of being your cousin,

[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.440]
it'd been your sister, OK?

[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:49.620]
Yeah.

[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:50.780]
No, wait a minute.

[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.540]
And your parents would have taken you

[00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.040]
on a trip to Kalamazooers somewhere.

[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.500]
And you would have all, you've been in a motel.

[00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:57.140]
And your mother and father were in run room.

[00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.140]
And the two of you were in another room

[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.480]
for your sleeping arrangements.

[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.960]
Now, is there a possibility that something might have happened?

[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.200]
Most likely in a reaction, but I don't know if anything else.

[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:07.100]
Well, that's good.

[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:07.900]
That's a good, healthy type.

[00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:08.220]
Yeah.

[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.960]
Like you say, I don't think there's anything.

[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.400]
If you make your sister, you didn't know, like,

[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.580]
too adopted people in two parts of the country,

[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:15.280]
and they made each other.

[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.780]
I don't think there'd be any kind of a barrier

[00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:20.300]
between them, you know, genetic barrier or a light

[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.220]
those of you're not supposed to be attracted to.

[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.820]
Well, when you grew up with somebody, it's different.

[00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.260]
There are all those signals there for bitten fruit.

[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.160]
So I didn't say that.

[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:27.920]
But it ain't worth it.

[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.760]
In fact, if you have any female relatives,

[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.100]
you might give it a shot.

[00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.540]
You know, just prove that.

[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.100]
No, I didn't have a cousin as a matter of fact,

[00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.480]
a female cousin, and we did do some interesting things.

[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.060]
That's OK.

[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.900]
I also had a male cousin, and we did some very interesting things.

[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.380]
So you're not a very real interest.

[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:45.820]
A heterosexual sense, too.

[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.020]
You know, I have a problem.

[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.060]
When I first started listening to you a few months ago,

[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.900]
I didn't realize that you were a homosexual.

[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.360]
Of course, you're a homosexual.

[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:55.720]
Hello, but can some regard.

[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.180]
And once I found out, I didn't care.

[00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.980]
And I started telling people about it,

[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.900]
and once I described you from, you know,

[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.240]
New York, Jewish, homosexual, they wouldn't listen.

[00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.580]
Then I started not telling them.

[00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.000]
They'd listen and love it.

[00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.080]
But now I'm running into a problem in the last week or so,

[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.180]
but your topic is the Hawaii.

[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.560]
But, you know, when I turn people on,

[00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:17.860]
I have to have a disclaimer.

[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.300]
You know, like, I am really OK.

[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.200]
He's really funny.

[00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.480]
But don't get shook up.

[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.620]
When he starts trolling, when he's trolls on the ear,

[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:26.960]
don't get up.

[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.860]
So you don't think that I'm really doing that seriously.

[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:30.860]
I mean, of course, there was always the whole point

[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.520]
in the back of my mind that maybe a miracle, you know,

[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.120]
might happen.

[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.180]
I mean, the video that I had in the AES today,

[00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:36.940]
that was ridiculous.

[00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:37.260]
Yeah.

[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:40.140]
Well, you know, some day, some day he'll be 20.

[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.160]
That's true.

[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:42.360]
Did he ever read here?

[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:42.860]
No.

[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:43.940]
Trust me.

[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:44.420]
No way.

[00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:45.260]
All right, no.

[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.200]
OK, take care.

[00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:47.340]
I'd say hi to your cousin.

[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:47.820]
I will.

[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:48.220]
OK.

[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:49.620]
Boy, that's incredible.

[00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:50.520]
Yeah.

[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:51.560]
Good call.

[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.540]
In fact, I'm really going to admit something

[00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:54.760]
on here now that I've been, you know,

[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:55.840]
I've always known.

[00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.360]
They're always pushing you to be more honest and more open.

[00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.860]
And I'm going to admit that I had sex with a 12-year-old boy.

[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.460]
But how old were you?

[00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:03.780]
12.

[00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:04.520]
OK.

[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.900]
In fact, I had sex with a couple of 12-year-old boys.

[00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.840]
When I say had sex, I mean, it was just, you know,

[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.820]
back when you were five minutes.

[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:14.380]
Yeah.

[00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.060]
It was four minutes.

[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:16.700]
Yeah.

[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.060]
Like in a basketball game, you know, a little dribble.

[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:21.780]
And that's about it.

[00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:25.760]
OK, it's 13 before 2 at WINZ.

[00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:28.520]
Well, so that took some great courage to admit that on the air.

[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.760]
When we come back, Len is going to make some startling

[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:31.780]
admissions to the audience.

[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:33.320]
Today is the day.

[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:34.740]
OK, I guess, huh?

[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.320]
Too much important business to do.

[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.340]
Oh, we could play just a little list of shoe bars.

[00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:43.020]
Sure.

[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.280]
Like the Copa.

[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.660]
Now, listen, I shouldn't say the Copa because there's a Copa

[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.440]
on Bird Road in South Miami.

[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.160]
And we know when they got not upset with me,

[00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:00.760]
but they were nervous a few years ago.

[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.800]
It was about four years ago on another radio station

[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.080]
because I had made some cracks about the Copa and the clientele.

[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.080]
And I was talking about the Copa in the Fort Lauderdale,

[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.920]
of course, off federal highway by the airport.

[00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.120]
Well, that's right.

[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.780]
Yeah, the Copa on Bird Road, you're talking about it.

[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:16.860]
Yeah, he called and begged me to go on and say,

[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:22.800]
hey, the Copa on Bird Road is not, is that still the Copa?

[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:23.200]
I can't remember.

[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:23.640]
I don't know.

[00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:24.940]
It may be something else now.

[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.540]
No, it's probably El Copa.

[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.420]
OK, Dave County.

[00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:28.720]
Hello.

[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:29.820]
Yeah, it's fine.

[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:30.260]
Who's this?

[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:31.460]
Let me check.

[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:32.960]
I think it's Neil.

[00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:34.400]
Hey, I know how you doing.

[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.120]
This is Gary from Dolphin Digest.

[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.260]
Yeah, how you doing, Gary?

[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.440]
You got the schedule cards for me.

[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.180]
Oh, OK.

[00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:42.240]
Thank you so much.

[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:42.800]
OK.

[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.640]
And there also we just discovered some hurricane cards in there, too.

[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.720]
Yeah, you gave you some hurricane cards.

[00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:48.960]
You gave you some Dolphin Digest.

[00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:49.980]
Well, we appreciate them.

[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:52.100]
We didn't like the pictures on the Dolphin schedule,

[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:53.240]
but nothing is perfect.

[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:55.200]
I like tanks picture, but the other one.

[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.100]
Yeah, well, we get a little bit of everything.

[00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:58.620]
We need to clean up his act.

[00:13:58.820 --> 00:13:59.540]
Well, what can you do?

[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:00.020]
I know.

[00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.520]
Well, I'll stop by next week.

[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:03.000]
Great.

[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:03.600]
Thanks for here.

[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.320]
Bye, bye.

[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:09.080]
Good guy, Gary from Dolphin Digest, who reprinted our so far ed.

[00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:09.520]
That's right.

[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.680]
And we appreciate that.

[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:12.240]
Oh, listen to that.

[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:12.980]
Broward, hello.

[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.140]
Hello there.

[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.420]
Boy, am I glad you're there after that big buildup?

[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:17.160]
Oh, wow.

[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:24.320]
Well, I'm talking to you from the tin can credit phone on the wind's jet blimp.

[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.840]
Oh, it sounds like it, too.

[00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:27.340]
How are you doing, Clarence?

[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:27.960]
It's like your phone.

[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:28.640]
Uh-huh.

[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.500]
OK, how's that?

[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:31.980]
That's even better.

[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:34.100]
All right, this is John, who was there yesterday.

[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:35.480]
Oh, John.

[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.760]
Oh, John, who was here yesterday?

[00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.160]
Yeah, not Michelle, John.

[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:38.980]
OK.

[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:40.500]
Yeah, this is the big one.

[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:41.060]
Great.

[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:48.400]
We had a water cooler installed in our office the other day.

[00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.220]
We could have a place to stand around and talk.

[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:52.740]
Blind for every day.

[00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.460]
You know, I know Tanner can relate to this.

[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.120]
And we got a little Ricky Tiki doll.

[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.400]
And we put them up on top of the water cooler.

[00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:05.520]
And all he does is he stands there with his sailor hat on.

[00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:07.080]
It says, talk to me, talk to me.

[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:08.280]
Yeah, we have one.

[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.760]
You wind it up, and it does talk ups.

[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:10.580]
It's incredible.

[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.380]
I do talk back.

[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:17.280]
I get your commercial time down perfect.

[00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:24.020]
And I come back in just as the wind's music is coming on.

[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.220]
Oh, look at that.

[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.400]
We just got a message that Copa is closed.

[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.600]
This is the one in Bird Road.

[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:28.980]
Yeah.

[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:30.900]
It's a funeral home or something now.

[00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:33.720]
So I really did something for their imager.

[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.540]
That's too bad.

[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.380]
Sorry, Monty O's.

[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:42.840]
We have a recording here also of the gerbos that actually

[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.500]
power the wind jet blimp.

[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:46.600]
20 hits.

[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:47.420]
Go ahead.

[00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.660]
That was good.

[00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:00.400]
Wait a minute.

[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.480]
I got an article here.

[00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:06.500]
Hold it.

[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:06.860]
OK.

[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.400]
I guess the gerbos ran out of the water.

[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:17.400]

[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:18.720]
Oh, boy.

[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.180]
I got an article here in a magazine.

[00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.780]
It'll take about two minutes to read.

[00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:25.360]
Well, good luck to you, John.

[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.020]
The chances of that on the scale of zero.

[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.560]
Oh, but it's about condoms and rock roots.

[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:32.960]
Minus infinity.

[00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.720]
You don't want to hear condoms and rock roots?

[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:36.980]
No, but you can send me the article.

[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:37.960]
You can bring it in Monday.

[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:38.200]
OK.

[00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:39.020]
I'll do that.

[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:40.560]
All right.

[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.420]
Well, did you make it to work yesterday, John?

[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:43.640]
Yeah.

[00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:44.980]
Welcome to Tadey yesterday.

[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:45.840]
Oh, that's right.

[00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:46.380]
Of course.

[00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:49.340]
So I know what I had to last thing.

[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.200]
I've got a song here.

[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:56.000]
And the title of the song is The Nips Are Getting Bigger.

[00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:57.080]
Oh, boy.

[00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.640]
Well, you dropped that by Zeta when you come into building.

[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:01.660]
They need something.

[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.180]
No, they won't play it.

[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.280]
They're too busy playing the door.

[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.800]
But they'll listen to it.

[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:08.820]
Well, we might, but I don't know if anybody else.

[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:09.200]
Yeah.

[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:09.300]

[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.500]
I noticed his nipples seem to be getting very large.

[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:12.600]
OK.

[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.060]
Listen, John.

[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.000]
Have a wonderful weekend.

[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.400]
And we'll see you around a block.

[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.140]
All right.

[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:16.740]
Take care.

[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:17.100]
OK.

[00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:17.640]
Bye, bye.

[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:19.260]
Dade County.

[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:19.560]
Hello.

[00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:20.700]
Hello, Neil.

[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:21.320]
Yeah.

[00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:22.240]
Are you two?

[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:22.900]
OK.

[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:24.060]
Oh, no, not him.

[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:24.880]
Frank caller.

[00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:26.160]
For one of the day, yeah.

[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:26.700]
What is he doing?

[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:27.360]
How are you doing, buddy?

[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:28.140]
Oh, yeah.

[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.920]
He's the one that called the first day we did this.

[00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:32.840]
Dade County.

[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:33.140]
Hello.

[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:34.180]
Neil.

[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:34.640]
Yeah.

[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:35.840]
Have you got in the mail, say?

[00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:37.680]
We don't get mail on Saturday.

[00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:38.440]
Oh, you don't?

[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:40.760]
Oh, and you're beginning my record on Monday.

[00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:41.820]
What record?

[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.280]
It's one that came out in 82 by the village people.

[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.620]
It has a touch trial.

[00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:48.660]
I'll wait till you get it on Monday,

[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:49.660]
and then you'll see what it is.

[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:50.900]
The village people?

[00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:51.400]
Yeah.

[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:52.920]
Ooh, I can't wait to see that.

[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.180]
It has a very interesting cover, too.

[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:56.000]
I'll bet.

[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.660]
It's a 12-inch mix of a one-of-a-spawn.

[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:02.880]
So let's see how you like it when you get it on Monday.

[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.000]
A 12-inch village people, huh?

[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:05.440]
Yeah.

[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:07.540]
It's unbelievable.

[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.520]
Well, listen, that's exciting.

[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:10.240]
We'll be looking for.

[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.380]
Is it some way you can play on the air?

[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:12.140]
Yeah.

[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.100]
Well, I'll tell you a title, a title,

[00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.220]
the name of the phone is called Sec over the Phone.

[00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.220]
I'll kind of like this show.

[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:19.400]
Like that?

[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:20.140]
Great.

[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:20.740]
That ought to be good.

[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:21.460]
Sounds promising.

[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:22.160]
OK.

[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:22.920]
Thanks a lot.

[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:23.280]
OK.

[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:23.780]
Adios.

[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.500]
There is freedom within.

[00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:30.180]
There is freedom without worries.

[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.340]
It's just a touch and tell you should be careful.

[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:33.280]
Unbelievable.

[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.440]
It is incredible.

[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:36.420]
Toot.

[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.000]
As they say, a popular one.

[00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:48.940]
Oh.

[00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:53.740]
More Elvis.

[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:03.940]
Major's in a building with his new Elvis Presley poster.

[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.160]
Bro, you ladies out there.

[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:07.940]
I don't think you've got a thing to worry about.

[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:07.960]
Ha.

[00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:08.820]

[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.360]
Well, it's all good things must.

[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.520]
And the fight button just comes to an end.
