[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.140]
He got up and gave me over a little card.

[00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.220]
She sells miniature cars or something.

[00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.960]
And autographed and a little nice message to her mother.

[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.900]
And then the waitress came over and Tinko.

[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.200]
Very nice. She Tinko said that my show was a panic.

[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.580]
And it was just great.

[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.600]
Pianic, panic.

[00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.040]
Yeah.

[00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.860]
That prompted neo-roger, the seldom-rightison W.I.N.Z.

[00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.600]
talk show host, to ridicule the heralduring

[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.120]
is 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. radio show.

[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.480]
He claimed that running a Spanish language ad

[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.140]
insulted English-speaking readers.

[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.680]
Throughout the day, subscribers called the paper

[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.260]
to complain.

[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]
The phone has been ringing off the hook, said Jim Kurol,

[00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.980]
the newspaper's vice president of advertising.

[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.000]
But he explained it was partly a mistake.

[00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.920]
It was a mistake, all right.

[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:40.980]
Yeah, you bet.

[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.620]
Yeah.

[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.940]
Buying the paper in the first place is your first mistake.

[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.680]
Creative ideas advertising of Kurol Gabel's,

[00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.280]
the desert in's ad agency, wanted to run the ad in two

[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.460]
of the heralds' neighbor's sections that

[00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.480]
reached predominantly Hispanic readers.

[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.020]
But the herald pulled the ad because it did not contain

[00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.540]
a disclaimer saying an English translation was available.

[00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.920]
Do you want more?

[00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.460]
Yeah.

[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.340]
OK.

[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.300]
The ad agency complained to assuage the agency.

[00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.020]
Boy, there is a good word, huh?

[00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.000]
Ooh, that's one of Daffy's favorite.

[00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.320]
That's as in rubbing the right way.

[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.360]
The herald agreed to run the ad with a disclaimer

[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.140]
in the front section of the paper.

[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.540]
In other words, to pacify the agency.

[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.620]
I think what a lame excuse that is.

[00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.740]
I never saw a disclaimer.

[00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.800]
That, Kurol, says, was the mistake.

[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.340]
Yeah.

[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.640]
The herald has a policy that allows advertisers to run ads

[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.460]
in Spanish without a translation.

[00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.800]
All other foreign language ads require English translations,

[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.760]
Kurol said.

[00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.020]
The ad agency says it wasn't trying to offend

[00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.620]
or discriminate against anyone.

[00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.000]
We wanted to get the attention of the, oh, man, this is it.

[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.080]
Boy, a little louder this time.

[00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.840]
Wait till you hear the last paragraph.

[00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.200]
The last one is the killer.

[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.880]
OK.

[00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.740]
Boy, I'm telling you, I wish they had their offices open today.

[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.840]
We could get 6,000 heralds' subscriptions

[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.200]
canceled in the first hour today.

[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.960]
We wanted to get the attention of the angloes

[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.820]
who would ask their Hispanic neighbors or friends,

[00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.020]
what does this mean?

[00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.580]
Said, Maritsa Gutierrez created ideas.

[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.860]
End of quote from the lame Miami herald.

[00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.700]
I'm going to tell you folks, if you don't cancel this rag,

[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.320]
next week I'm never speaking to you again.

[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.460]
What a disgrace.

[00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:39.420]
Is that incredible?

[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.140]
I mean, what a lame excuse, too.

[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.740]
See, they listened to you.

[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.540]
They know all about you at the herald.

[00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.980]
I told you.

[00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.160]
The phone was ringing off the hook.

[00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.840]
It's too bad.

[00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.740]
People were pissed.

[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.020]
All right, did I tell you my herald story?

[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.920]
Oh, you got one?

[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.820]
It's very brief.

[00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.360]
Well, let me do the break first, OK?

[00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.700]
All right.

[00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.100]
We'd like to do our breaks a little early.

[00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.580]
Why?

[00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:58.800]
Because I cross them off early.

[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.380]
I just get, well, I get nervous, you know.

[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.280]
So I cross into the next couple of hours I cross them off.

[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.340]
And Kyle is desperate to catch up.

[00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.180]
It's 28 before 11.

[00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.100]
What a story.

[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.300]
How?

[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.960]
What a paper.

[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.020]
What a town.

[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.760]
What a town.

[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.880]
See, what is this?

[00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.000]
Let's do a break.

[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.600]
We'll be right back.

[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.460]
Equig, here's the weather for homestead.

[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.540]
I think my ambition imitation.

[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.380]
Is there such a thing?

[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.980]
I get Tom Gallagher back in here to do his ambition imitation.

[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.900]
Many Tom can speak that low.

[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.360]
I like it.

[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.840]
And she's good.

[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.000]
She get rid of those matronly sweaters, though.

[00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.540]
So before he wears the sweater that is made

[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.320]
of Jim Harper's burgundy sweater,

[00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.000]
you know the man has been here for 30 years

[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.800]
at this radio station.

[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.320]
He has never taken the sweater off.

[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.840]
Much less cleaned it.

[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.280]
Now that never takes it off.

[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:51.460]
That's a true story.

[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.820]
Yeah.

[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.580]
It is true.

[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.640]
That's why he buys coffee at McDonald's

[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.600]
in the morning of the drive-through.

[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.200]
They won't let him go inside any place.

[00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.920]
He just goes through the drive-through.

[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:00.480]
He does.

[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.440]
He buys coffee every morning.

[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.540]
Oh, look at this.

[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.260]
He wants to wear a blue one once.

[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.060]
Yeah, one day.

[00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.760]
Only Gloria Brown knows when that was.

[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.980]
So before we get back to the story.

[00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:09.640]
How you doing, Gloria?

[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.820]
About the restaurant.

[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.280]
I had one tell you my herald story quickly.

[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.780]
I had to call the herald last week.

[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.460]
Do you realize it's 21 before 11?

[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.220]
Already, we've almost killed his whole first hour.

[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.840]
And we're just getting going.

[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.760]
We have the warmly audience up here today.

[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.840]
I've been here since six, and I'm not going yet.

[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.180]
I'm not getting going yet.

[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.680]
But anyway, is that a threat?

[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.100]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.280]
Look at that, man.

[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.700]
The phones are just going crazy.

[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.320]
I can't imagine what's on their mind.

[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.160]
Here's the weather for North Mighty Beach.

[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.720]
Mostly cloudy.

[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.840]
I had to put a trot expression was weather fairy.

[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.200]
Go ahead.

[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.420]
The weather fairy.

[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.700]
He was dressed up as an elf during this thing before Christmas.

[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:52.320]
Oh.

[00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.560]
And he referred to himself as the weather fairy.

[00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.180]
And I just repeated that on the ear,

[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.620]
and he won't be just, will not come near this building anymore.

[00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.280]
Boy, there used to be a character called the weather fairy.

[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.220]
Yeah, and Bidouche.

[00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.220]
I don't see anything wrong with that.

[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.600]
No.

[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.660]
Who show?

[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.380]
Greg Bidouche.

[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:07.900]
He's to have the weather fairy.

[00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.500]
Don't say that Jim Kelly is probably listening.

[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.420]
It will be very upset.

[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.120]
Yes, he will.

[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.520]
With good reason.

[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.980]
How do you feel, Greg, taking a guy's job after 10 years?

[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.440]
Yeah.

[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.480]
Hang your head in shame.

[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.940]
Jim probably is listening.

[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.140]
I mean, it's not like Alan Burke.

[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.540]
Alan was loaded anyway, right?

[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.540]
I mean, Jim's out there getting food stamps today.

[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.660]
You know, in fact, Jim gave a quote to Linda Thornton that she did use it.

[00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:28.820]
Well, that's her yesterday.

[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:29.180]
That's her.

[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.240]
And the quote was, she's on the antifocus.

[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.480]
Yeah.

[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.440]
He's got all the gossip.

[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.440]
Linda asked Jim if he had any immediate plans.

[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.780]
And Jim told Linda that we could print in the paper.

[00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.140]
No, Jim told Linda Thornton that his immediate plan was to get up in the morning, make

[00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.820]
himself a cup of coffee, go down and sit in the jacuzzi and listen to the Neil Rogers

[00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:47.200]
show.

[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.600]
Great.

[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.320]
I always liked what Jim Kelly was.

[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.440]
Yeah.

[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:50.940]
And he does listen to this show.

[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.440]
He absolutely loves this show.

[00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.460]
And I did Jim's news on the air for about six, eight years.

[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.500]
And he's a real good guy.

[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.800]
And I really enjoyed working with him.

[00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.400]
And you did Jim on the air?

[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.360]
No, I worked with him.

[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.040]
I did his news.

[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:02.700]
Oh, I see.

[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.140]
And stuff like that.

[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.480]
And I wish him all the best.

[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.660]
And I think he'll be fine.

[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.840]
Anyway.

[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.060]
I do.

[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.520]
I mean, the way you just brush a guy off like that, you know, like he was like a fly on

[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.040]
your noses.

[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.300]
I think he'll be fine.

[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.160]
I'm moving right along.

[00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.460]
Yeah.

[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.940]
What else can I say?

[00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:24.700]
We need to take up a collection.

[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:25.900]
Do something for the guy.

[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.600]
Boy, the way these radio stations just jerk people around and it's disgusting.

[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.200]
Don't buy an asteroid there.

[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.120]
Don't buy a hunt.

[00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.820]
Jim, I'm glad you did.

[00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.720]
That's the one thing they tell you when they hire you in this business.

[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.560]
They say they look you in the eye and they say don't buy a house.

[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.340]
And when the first book comes out, they look you in the eye and they say don't unpack.

[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.340]
You know, whatever that means.

[00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.920]
Well, luckily Kelly's been in this business long enough to know not to buy a house.

[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:51.720]
He didn't buy one.

[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.160]
Anyway, look at Bill Carter.

[00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:54.080]
He bought two houses.

[00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.340]
Got more nerve than I do.

[00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:56.880]
Yes, he does.

[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:57.860]
That's for sure.

[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.340]
I called the hair.

[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.440]
Bill hasn't cashed a ticket.

[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.360]
And so long.

[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.000]
I don't know if he's awake now this early.

[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.600]
Yeah, he's probably getting ready to go to Gulfstream.

[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.120]
It's raining.

[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.600]
And I guarantee you, Carter's getting ready to plunge his guts out today.

[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.480]
He hasn't cashed a ticket.

[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.540]
I can't remember when he can't.

[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:14.980]
I'm serious.

[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.160]
I cannot remember when Carter last cashed a ticket.

[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.420]
And I'm not joking about that either.

[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.780]
He is old for Gulfstream.

[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.600]
He keeps saying that.

[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.860]
Old for Gulfstream.

[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:26.820]
Yeah, for the whole meeting.

[00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.760]
And they run like 50 days.

[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.620]
That's a long time.

[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.560]
Yeah, especially when you're there every day.

[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.940]
Now he's missed a couple days.

[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:34.860]
Kidding.

[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:35.680]
What happened?

[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.340]
I couldn't afford it.

[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.840]
So, anyway, notice we've almost got to the end of the hour.

[00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.980]
We still haven't heard your hero story.

[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.080]
And we're not even close to the rest of the road.

[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:49.700]
The rest of the road.

[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:51.660]
That's light years away.

[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.560]
See, this is the kind of show I like.

[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.180]
These pain-and-e-ass callers, you know?

[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.220]
Give it a rest.

[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:56.820]
No, I know.

[00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:57.820]
That is Cuban.

[00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.560]
You know, they want to get all hysterical.

[00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:00.900]
I'll get hysterical about it.

[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:01.160]
Okay.

[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.360]
I can get hysterical.

[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:02.960]
No, I know you're...

[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.420]
I happen to like a lot of the Cubans.

[00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:05.740]
You're very pleased.

[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.080]
This is your favorite kind of show.

[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.220]
Favorite kind of first hour.

[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:08.640]
You bet.

[00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:09.660]
I'm leaving you.

[00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:10.440]
Wait till the next hour.

[00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:11.020]
Yeah, I'm leaving you.

[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:11.920]
You're not going anywhere.

[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:12.740]
I got news for you.

[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:13.560]
I'm leaving.

[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.740]
I think it's damn time that they give me a holiday.

[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.120]
Let's see all the people that want to go in this day and meet a leave.

[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:20.700]
Look at that.

[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:21.820]
Six of us are so pretty.

[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:22.260]
Are you ringing?

[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:23.900]
Don't be picky.

[00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:25.700]
Okay.

[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.400]
We can get that other broward line flashing real quick.

[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.060]
I'm telling you.

[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.220]
I'm out of here as they say in the soaps.

[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.740]
Why do people today?

[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:36.620]
You know, young people always come up with these ridiculous, at least to me, the ridiculous,

[00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:37.900]
because I'm an old fart.

[00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:38.540]
Okay.

[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:38.900]
Right.

[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.120]
I'm out of here.

[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.080]
Boy, that expression just drives me nuts.

[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:42.600]
Yeah.

[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:44.560]
And you know who started that?

[00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.740]
Bow on the days of our lives.

[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:47.220]
Oh no.

[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.020]
That mong face.

[00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:48.780]
He started that.

[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.340]
I'm out of here.

[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:53.180]
Tony, he started a year ago before anybody else was even saying it.

[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.440]
It's like party down.

[00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:55.160]
It's another thing.

[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.020]
Oh, Haiti after has me nuts.

[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:57.580]
Party down.

[00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.200]
What does that mean?

[00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:00.220]
Party hearty.

[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:05.040]
That's a big talk about mindless people who will just, that's the thing that bugs me.

[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:06.000]
People are such sheep.

[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.900]
Some moron will come up with a ridiculous.

[00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:09.500]
Oh, that's true.

[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:14.240]
It might have been Stevie Caughtin who started saying, you know, you remember Daffy doing

[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:19.180]
that show talking about Stevie Caughtin was responsible for young people saying, you know, you talk

[00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:20.100]
about inanity.

[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:25.800]
I mean, that show on a scale of zero, that had to be, I'm glad you brought that up Kyle, because that, I'm telling you.

[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.040]
That kind of epitomized the whole Taffy McCallum show for me.

[00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.220]
That was, that was it.

[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.700]
That was the frosting on the cake.

[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.600]
Steve Caughtin, who never even said, you know, he never said anything.

[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.780]
Other than hello and good bye and where's my check?

[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:40.780]
And that was about it.

[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.180]
Where's my 10% or whatever.

[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:49.680]
And of course, we know that all young people were just star struck by Stevie Caughtin.

[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.240]
You could go up and down to Broward Mall right now.

[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:58.220]
And kids would say, oh, Steve Caughtin, they would swoon, they'd fall on the floor just by the mention of the name.

[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:02.020]
And God forbid you should mention cash, ass mucin, they'd go nuts.

[00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:04.100]
And you don't even know who that is.

[00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.320]
No, I do. That's good.

[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:06.240]
Not a clue.

[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:08.540]
Are you gonna tell us?

[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:09.240]
It's a jockey.

[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:09.700]
Oh.

[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.160]
Who also went to England.

[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:13.080]
Okay.

[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.800]
He was too good looking to write in America.

[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.060]
They sent all the good looking jockeys to England.

[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.700]
I don't know how Caughtin got over there.

[00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.060]
Well, you know, those English, they need optometrist.

[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:22.980]
Like Angie Dickinson.

[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.440]
The seldom reticent.

[00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:27.200]
Isn't that great?

[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.400]
Boy, I made the Harold again today.

[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.820]
I'm gonna go home and write it in my diarrhea.

[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.560]
You ridiculed the Harold.

[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:32.100]
Yeah.

[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.640]
And you shame on you, Neil.

[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:39.440]
You ridiculed the prestigious Miami hero with all those Pulitzer prizes.

[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.460]
Sort of leads into my story about the Harold.

[00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:43.140]
In fact, they're up.

[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:44.920]
Well, I don't think yet.

[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.500]
They're up for a Pulitzer prize for yellow journalism.

[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.020]
Is that great?

[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.060]
The Harold, the daily news and the inquire are battling it out.

[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.580]
See who can win the Pulitzer prize's Yellow Ribbon Award.

[00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.640]
So while you like that cigar, I'll tell the story.

[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:01.940]
And that's what you think.

[00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.560]
We have another break and we could do it at any moment now.

[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.320]
We could talk about AFMED.

[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.060]
We could talk about Gulfstream with Joe Neymar.

[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.340]
I might do this spot myself.

[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.960]
Hey, by the way, tomorrow is the 24th.

[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.680]
Tomorrow is that big jackpot day.

[00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:14.400]
You know, for the Sunday.

[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:14.900]
That's right.

[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:15.600]
You're doing the drawing.

[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.600]
Yeah, the spring break.

[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.700]
I saw the ad.

[00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.480]
It's spring break.

[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.580]
Something tied in with spring break.

[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.600]
Aren't they going to have Frankie Avalon and...

[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:29.640]
They've already done that.

[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.320]
Oh, they already did that.

[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.180]
They may be there again, but they've already done that.

[00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:32.960]
That's on no interest.

[00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:33.600]
No interest.

[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:34.520]
I didn't think so.

[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.440]
Nobody is, in fact, that was going to be the big thing that brought everybody back to Fort Lauderdale.

[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.720]
Now, the real reason I want to go out there today is because we ran a spot on Monday.

[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.360]
And I believe in truth and advertising just like the ad in the Harold.

[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.320]
And it said, no, really, it said,

[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.900]
see and bet the pre-knotes this Saturday at Gulf Stream.

[00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.100]
So I'm taking, I've already taken all the money in the world that I've got.

[00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.860]
I'm plunging on Ali Shee-Dee.

[00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:56.220]

[00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:57.100]
Ali Shee-Dee.

[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:57.360]

[00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:02.340]
So...

[00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:05.420]
And I made about a few perfectes with Ali Shee-Dee and bet twice.

[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:05.940]
Six-one.

[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.040]
Those numbers just keep running through my head.

[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.780]
I just keep seeing those black-eyed Susan.

[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:17.760]
I want to know a black-eyed Susan.

[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.780]
Susan Day, she was on the Partridge family.

[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:21.240]
Do you remember her?

[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.880]
Yeah, she's on LA Law now.

[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:24.020]
Yeah, she's always beat up.

[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:26.420]
You know, she's always one of those abused young women.

[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.460]
No, David Cassidy beat the hell out of her head.

[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.320]
Yeah, now she's a lawyer.

[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.060]
Oh, is she really?

[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:32.840]
I don't watch that.

[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:33.400]
She should.

[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.920]
Now that not planning to rerun, if you want to see the real sex on TV.

[00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:38.180]
I hate to break the news to you.

[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.180]
I don't watch those network shows, okay?

[00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:41.040]
But this is...

[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:41.680]
I don't watch that.

[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:41.920]
That's wrong.

[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.040]
Like last night I was home for just a few minutes.

[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.580]
I watched the hockey game in the mix.

[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.180]
Do you think I would leave you a sports?

[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.640]
I mean, I'd leave you a sports.

[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:48.960]

[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:49.380]
Trust me.

[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:50.080]
I'm macho, okay?

[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:50.760]
I'm into sports.

[00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.280]
I watched a little bit of the hockey game.

[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.040]
In fact, I did see Edmonton score their first goal.

[00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:58.620]
Messier scored on a breakaway.

[00:12:58.740 --> 00:12:59.200]
That was great.

[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.760]
Right between Hextall's legs, if you pardon the expression,

[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:03.360]
man, it was great on a breakaway.

[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.420]
And I left the house feeling confident that Edmonton would win.

[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:07.360]
What do I know?

[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.280]
How would I know the game was fixed?

[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.020]
I mean, who else could give up five goals in the last part?

[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.240]
I mean, that's ridiculous.

[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.740]
Ludicrous, but then you're not into hockey.

[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:19.920]
You wouldn't know anything about that.

[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:20.420]
Nothing.

[00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:21.540]
Zero?

[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:22.240]
Zilch.

[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.120]
Something about a puck.

[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:24.840]
That's all I know.

[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:25.340]
Uh-huh.

[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.060]
And the guy wears a...

[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.920]
The goalie wears a mask looks like Jason and Friday the 13th.

[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:30.260]
Exactly.

[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.600]
No, the goalie is Jason from Friday the 13th.

[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.640]
That's why he gave up five goals in the last period.

[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:36.680]
Okay, we have another break to do.

[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.540]
Then Glenn's maybe going to work into that story about the hero,

[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:40.620]
which I know is going to be exciting.

[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.560]
I'm going to reread for the benefit of the audience

[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:43.960]
at just getting up now and tuning in.

[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.300]
I'm going to reread several times that story

[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.420]
from this morning's business news section

[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:50.200]
because most people don't read the business section anyway,

[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:50.980]
unless they got money.

[00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:52.480]
And that leaves our audience out.

[00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:54.880]
Absolutely, Marshall Moore, that's got the people with money.

[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.500]
And they're so damn cheap, man.

[00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.400]
He's got Marshall, you ought to be embarrassed.

[00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.940]
You do a great show, but your audience doesn't appreciate you.

[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.640]
All they want you to do is give and give and give to them.

[00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:08.040]
I've got 7,000 shares of Con Edison.

[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:09.420]
You know, who cares, lady?

[00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:11.680]
Put it where the moon don't shine, baby.

[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.320]
We don't care about your Con Edison.

[00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:16.300]
It's true, though.

[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.260]
There are a bunch of cheap skates at tune-units show.

[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.200]
That's why they got all the money.

[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:20.740]
They have the first two nickels they ever made.

[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.060]
They sit there rubbing them together all day.

[00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:24.000]
Which is all they've got.

[00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:26.600]
10 minutes before 11 at WINZ,

[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.060]
we're going to come back right after these important messages.

[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.240]
54 news wins.

[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.660]
You know, in all fairness, I think the ad team

[00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.220]
should have done that spot for Gulfstream

[00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.340]
to be instant bankroll sweepstakes being given away.

[00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:39.780]
Can you hear Russ doing it now?

[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.020]
10,000 dollars!

[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.160]
Wouldn't that be great?

[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.720]
That would be how it would sound, wouldn't it?

[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:46.420]
Yeah.

[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:46.940]
I'm Tony.

[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.300]
There's a guy who has made millions.

[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.240]
Millions.

[00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:51.360]
From what?

[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:52.780]
I mean, that's the incredible part.

[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.580]
And I think it's great.

[00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:55.180]
He's a great American.

[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.560]
We used to be disc jockeys together.

[00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:58.320]
Russ and I.

[00:14:58.500 --> 00:14:59.360]
We used to work together on the whole lot.

[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.560]
Yeah, look at the difference.

[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:01.320]
Yeah, oh boy.

[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:04.400]
You're just barely eking out a meager existence.

[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.340]
Just barely.

[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:06.680]
And he's a meager.

[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.840]
He's flinging, hanging on.

[00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:10.660]
And the man is a multi-millionaire.

[00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:12.580]
He did us a very nice favor, though.

[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.040]
Yes, he did.

[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:14.320]
They've been great with us.

[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.180]
They've been terrific.

[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.380]
They did the newspaper ads for so far.

[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:17.660]
Yeah.

[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:18.920]
They've made great ads.

[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:19.480]
You bet.

[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:20.940]
They donated their services.

[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:21.780]
Super.

[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:23.440]
Absolutely terrific.

[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.220]
And they've worked with us and they've been great.

[00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:28.860]
And I really would like to publicly thank them.

[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.000]
I've already thanked.

[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:30.340]
Good.

[00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:32.440]
But he's got millions of dollars anyway.

[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:32.840]
True.

[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:33.780]
That's true.

[00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.420]
In fact, he ought to be buying the ads for us.

[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.040]
Only kidding, Russ.

[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:37.400]
Come on.

[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:37.900]
Only kidding.

[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:38.340]
That's right.

[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:39.880]
He's got a good sense of humor.

[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.940]
Yeah. He doesn't like the hero too well, by the way.

[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:42.620]
He hates the hero.

[00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:44.680]
He was so happy about your campaign.

[00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:45.960]
He mentioned it to me.

[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.440]
And why is it that so many people hate the hero?

[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.600]
I mean, people who really have an IQ of over 10.

[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:51.100]
Right.

[00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:51.800]
Keep the hero.

[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:53.160]
I mean, despise it.

[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:54.400]
True.

[00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:58.240]
Oh, I mean, really, there are people who don't like the New York Times.

[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.780]
But they generally tend to be those right-wing lunatics.

[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.600]
You know, I think the Times is a communist newspaper.

[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.880]
OK, that's philosophy.

[00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:07.100]
There are people who don't like the Washington Post for the same reason.

[00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:09.960]
There are people who don't like the Chicago Tribune because it's too conservative.

[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:11.820]
But again, that has to do with philosophy.

[00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:15.440]
But there are people who hate the hero just on principle.

[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:15.820]
I know.

[00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:16.460]
Right?

[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:17.020]
I know.

[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.680]
Because the hero, once upon a time, was a lot more liberal than it is now.

[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.560]
I mean, now it's basically a fascist newspaper.

[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.320]
But once upon a time, it was a moderate newspaper.

[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:26.420]
The news was the liberal paper, indeed.

[00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.140]
And the hero was like kind of moderate.

[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.360]
Like they might endorse the Nazi party.

[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.500]
Things like that now, they've gone way beyond that.

[00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:38.960]
But there are a lot of people, philosophy aside, who just despise the hero.

[00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:39.600]
Yeah, they do.

[00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:43.840]
Who'd like to see Don Johnson go into, you know, one hero plans and plant a bomb, you know.

[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:48.480]
And speed off and look in the rearview mirror, like boom, you know, just the whole thing glop into the bay.

[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:49.400]
It's true.

[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:50.900]
And I found it out.

[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:51.480]
It is.

[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:51.940]
Yeah.

[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.340]
In fact, when we come back from the news, Glandis is going to tell us his Harold story.

[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:56.960]
I got to wait till I did the video.

[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:57.380]
Oh, yes.

[00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:58.620]
Well, you know, big build up.

[00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:00.800]
Hey, we have to build these numbers here.

[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:04.980]
You know, I mean, we've got to build to what about a 10 share so that she doesn't sell the station.

[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:06.640]
Only kidding, Mrs. Holly.

[00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:07.420]
Well, that was great.

[00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:09.520]
She came in here with that dog the other day.

[00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:09.780]
Mac.

[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:10.920]

[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:11.600]
Big Mac.

[00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.660]
Leave it to Gland to find out that they were the dog.

[00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:18.640]
You know, I guess it must be all of that time that you spent as the, what was the title?
