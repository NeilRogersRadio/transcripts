[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.580]
You talk about a weekend that could put anybody into a coma.

[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.040]
I don't know where to start. I really don't know where to start.

[00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.700]
I want to thank our morning crew over there, Frick and Frank over on Zeta 4

[00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.840]
for giving you a chance at 9 o'clock this morning to promote our so far campaign.

[00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.840]
And of course most of their audiences on drugs, so they don't know they haven't got any idea what it is that I said over there.

[00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.000]
But that's okay, at least the intention was good. It's not the result that counts.

[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.680]
It's the intention. That's what's important as we found out Saturday over at that whole fiasco.

[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.440]
That was the most embarrassing day in the history of this business.

[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.420]
I mean, well, no, I shouldn't say that because flowers on five days a week.

[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.240]
But it was close. It was right in their fighting.

[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.920]
I do want to thank a lot of nice people who came out to CB Smith Park.

[00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.200]
And I apologize that you had a pay unless you live in Pember of Pines to get into the park.

[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.060]
Because, oh man, I'm telling you that guy over there with Pumpernix.

[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.660]
I hope you're listening this morning, Candor, whatever your name is.

[00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:08.080]
I hope you really got the radio turned up loud and got your tape recorder cranked up and all your lawyers and everybody else.

[00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.440]
I have never been involved in anything so embarrassing in my whole life.

[00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.160]
It was an obscenity.

[00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.820]
I have never been to a prostitute and I am not or have ever been a homosexual.

[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.180]
Okay, that's from one of the other shows in town this morning, a little disclaimer.

[00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.160]
But we'll save that for later on in the show.

[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.560]
How did that pop up again just by itself that came on? Have you noticed that?

[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.700]
Isn't it great watching all of those fakers now?

[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.020]
I mean, they're all pointing the finger at each other and there was that anchor bird with that big smile on his face.

[00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.920]
And you notice he had his hand in his pocket the whole time he was doing that show.

[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.440]
In fact, he had one hand in his pocket and the other one in Larry King's pocket couldn't believe it.

[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.140]
It was disgusting.

[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.120]
And all of these religious fakers, man, we're all running around pointing the finger at each other.

[00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.240]
Oh, it's bad for business and Billy.

[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.700]
Whatever his name is, Billy Graham lost two million last month and fall well lost a million and a half.

[00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.300]
And that's all they're talking about is how much money they're losing.

[00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.780]
They've just totally lost it. You notice they just go nuts.

[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.060]
But that's not the agenda here today, folks.

[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.100]
We have a lot of things to cover.

[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.260]
I want to thank Ron Sax, a channel 10.

[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.720]
At least Ron is still a channel 10 for a couple of more weeks.

[00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.400]
But had nice conversation with him on the phone over the weekend and he did a positive thing.

[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.920]
And you believe that because Ron and I in the past have had a couple of real run-ins.

[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.300]
But I find out that he's a big fan of this show and he listens.

[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.280]
You should pardon the expression religiously to this program.

[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.800]
And he gave us some nice plugs for the so far campaign and he knows and all the other people in the media know that I'm absolutely right.

[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.780]
There's no question about it. The commission is no business in censoring what it is we say on the air.

[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.300]
There was a great column by Tom Sander, the editorial writer.

[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.280]
I believe this is out of the Sun Sentinel.

[00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.180]
I think so.

[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.580]
A great column.

[00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:03.100]
And one of the paragraphs, the Vialist obscenities are not the seven dirty words, but laws or court rulings that try to censor any words.

[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.620]
Amen.

[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.720]
And of course we'll get to the Cosford column because Bill again really hit it on the head.

[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.860]
Anybody want to take odds and whether Cosford will be working at the Mimey Herald at the end of the day?

[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.720]
I mean, Cosford is a guy who has got some serious, some big balls.

[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.200]
I mean, here's a guy with guts, okay?

[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.500]
You never know it to look at him because he's got very small fingers, but here's a guy who really pressed me.

[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.740]
Has got some serious activity in between the ears, some real brains.

[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.760]
Where do I start on Saturday? Do I just tell the story?

[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.080]
I know. It's hopeless. It's just nowhere to start.

[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:47.820]
I mean, between this company, I mean, this company, man, I'll tell you really, Guy Gannett Broadcasting, and I know they pay my check and they pay me well, well, they think they do every couple of weeks.

[00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.100]
But when the book comes out today, I'm going to go on strike.

[00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.300]
But hey, listen, the book could be a disaster. You never know. Don't let those arbitrains fool you.

[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.520]
Could be like Pumpernicks. It could turn out that another talk host mother works there.

[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.000]
I think I'm just going to sit here and leave dead air for like an hour.

[00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:21.180]
Oh, I started to say we want to thank there were a lot of really nice people that came out to see me Smith Park, and you were supposed to be able to get in for free, even if you didn't live at Pember of Pines, or at least that's what this guy from Pumpernicks told me as he was driving me into the park and other people were being charged the buck.

[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.980]
He says, oh, I don't want to participate in this unless your listeners could get in for free to see the show.

[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:42.520]
And everybody's paying, you know, so I mean this guy, and of course this was he was driving me into the park because my car at that point was sitting in the parking lot on Taft Street in prestigious Pember of Pines with four flat tires.

[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.400]
See, one thing I like about this company, they really care about the safety of their employees. They're really concerned about that.

[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.560]
And obviously the guy of Pumpernicks was too.

[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.340]
He hired the world's only invisible security guard. It was fantastic. Nobody could see him.

[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:06.720]
And not only did we have the guy in the brown leisure suit, and yeah, I know you're listening out there. You miserable rotten old fart. We know who you are.

[00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:19.020]
Not only did we have that guy who slashed the tires, but we also had another old maniac right outside the front entrance there Saturday morning in this man. If he didn't have a stroke, then he's never going to have one.

[00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:35.360]
When I got there, he was screaming when I was inside, he was screaming. And when I came out, he was still screaming. He was, and this was going on for like half an hour.

[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:42.340]
Now, I somebody in a crowd didn't have the good common sense to punch this guy's brains out. I have no idea, but I mean this guy was impossible.

[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:53.620]
Another one, just like at the diplomat mall, who were the male contents were the young people? We keep hearing about the young rowdy punks and all of that.

[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:03.400]
Now, in fact, we had a lot of young people come out to the park, and except for that little kid who was telling me about John Sigmund in Pittsburgh, except for that wise guy, they were great.

[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:12.620]
But it's some of these measurable old disgust that in their frightening man, I'm telling you, like this guy up in Palm Bay, he was no spring chicken, he was 60.

[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:20.360]
See, and they don't care. They really don't give it them because they figure well, we've lived our lives, so we don't give it them about anybody else.

[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:29.320]
So, you know, let's blow them all away. Let's get it out of our systems. So it's a major miracle that I'm sitting here speaking to you alive.

[00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:39.500]
We'd have to have Shirley McLean and Shirley Peters here today under different circumstances because it could have just as easily been me as the four tires that got blown out on Saturday.

[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:46.000]
And I notice we have a lot of beefed up security. If you want to come in and puncture the tires again, that's okay because our gates wide open here today at the station.

[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:55.640]
So if you want to come in, please, it's fine with me because the station is writing me a check today for $400.89 and if they want to give me new tires every day, that's okay.

[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:02.220]
I'll be the only guy in America, even the millionaires don't do that. We'll use them for one day and the next day we'll replace them.

[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.520]
Although I like the ones with the raised white letters a lot better than these. Okay, so the next time, let's do it right.

[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:21.220]
I mean, these are okay. When I tell you the story of what went on on Saturday, you're just going to do cartwheels, you're going to pin your pants, you're going to have a nervous breakdown.

[00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:26.460]
Okay, not of course to mention the four hours of embarrassment that went on the air under the name of talk, Mania.

[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:32.020]
You know what we had on WINZ for four hours? Well, I can't say that for four hours on Saturday.

[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:50.800]
Four hours of that. Are we still on the air? Okay, I mean, I can't believe what I participated in. I was just like a, like I was taking hostage or something.

[00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:55.140]
Did I make all the lights on the crown monitor?

[00:07:55.140 --> 00:08:12.780]
Oh, that's a little inside technical thing that the audience wouldn't understand. But I guess we finally, even the brain dead parts of our equipment upstairs finally just woke up.

[00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:20.080]
Maybe the, and by the way, if there are any more people in the building, I want to bring any more Howard Stern tapes. I'm sick of that already. Okay.

[00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:30.240]
You notice you can't do anything in moderation here. Have you noticed that? I mean, a couple of more okay and Glenn Hill, by the way, started all of that. So we probably ought to beat him up for us for doing it.

[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:40.460]
But enough is enough already. I mean, he guy is funny and we giving him his, his do and everybody's writing about him. But I don't want to hear anymore, but it's how many times can he here lesbian dilatate?

[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:45.320]
And now everybody in his brother here is bringing Howard Stern tapes. I'm not interested anymore. Okay.

[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:51.320]
In fact, I think that the little sound effect I just made was more exciting than the tape we played for two hours the other day.

[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:59.340]
I think we ought to have a poll today to see who was the most destructive on Saturday. Was it Kathy West or was it Taffy McCallum?

[00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:08.860]
Poor Mike Spindell. Now one thing I'll say about Mike. He is almost always at his best when we have those kinds of shows. Not on his own show. No.

[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:20.360]
They hate him on Sunday, man. They just pick him the pieces. But what we have one of those get together. That seems to be where he shines, at least in the past as in Roy Shine.

[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:37.540]
Was it Roy Shine? Roy Cohn's boyfriend. Was that his name? I don't think so. It'll come to me. But anyway, even Mike was just overwhelmed by the mediocrity of what was going on there on Saturday. Nobody could hear anything.

[00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:46.220]
I couldn't hear even the people sitting next to me. And a crowd was getting restless because they were all there frying their brains out. And of course Taffy was enjoying that because she likes to see anybody fry.

[00:09:47.260 --> 00:10:01.460]
And that's all she kept saying, man. Capital punishment. How can you be against it? How can you be? It's all she said. And even when I was doing my routine about Smith College, she just kept rambling on about capital punishment. That's all that woman knows.

[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:09.700]
I think she really wants to star in one of those in that movie, the Terminator because if there's anybody terminal, she's the one boy. She incredible.

[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:16.680]
In fact, I want to tell you Saturday may have had something positive come out of that show because they have canceled her subject and her guest for today.

[00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:29.440]
They're going to be giving Taffy McCallum electroshock therapy for two hours on a radio from two to four this afternoon. Of that, I'll listen to. I'll make it a point. I'll sit in the parking lot and listen to that while they're jacking up the car to put the new tires on.

[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:48.880]
Hey, listen, 400 bucks a day. Let's see. Six days a week. That's 2400 a week. That's only a little over 100 grand a year. It's not bad. It's 1019 at W.I. and Z. And I got so much to do here today. I mean, there's so many things that I have little notes written down.

[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:58.860]
By the way, if you haven't been to Pumpernix in Pembroke Pines, there is no Pumpernix in Pembroke Pines. There's a Royal Market cafeteria that put a sign up that says Pumpernix. That's it.

[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:13.160]
If there's anybody out there, you know, if I had a business with a famous name, okay, with a positive reputation, I wouldn't just be handing it out casually and saying, hey, you know, pay me a few bucks. I'll let you use my name.

[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:24.760]
It would be like Royal Castle putting up a sign that said Burns State House, you know, 20 minutes past 10 at W.I. and Z. We're going to take a little commercial break. And when we come back, we have some more great sound effects.

[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:33.880]
1023 at W.I. and Z also when I get them with a whole story about Saturday, then I've got an even better story to tell you about my apartment that I'm moving out of again.

[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:43.820]
You see, you get to the point in your life where you get tired of being abused and here in Florida, in this part of South Florida. And I really discovered it finally after all these years yesterday.

[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:48.820]
You drive around looking for a place to live and you realize it doesn't make any difference where you live.

[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:59.160]
This is the only part of the country where we have all the bedroom communities, but there is nothing else. In other words, in Detroit, you've got Southfield and Royal Oak and, yeah, anything else.

[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:08.980]
There's a city. Whether you like it or not, whether it's good or bad, there's a city. Here, all we have are bedroom communities. There's nothing else. They're not bedroom to anything. They're just bedroom communities.

[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:17.480]
I mean, you could be living in Pembroke Pines or in Plantation or in Sunrise or in Peoria. It doesn't make any difference.

[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:29.140]
And I hope my landlord, by the way, is listening this morning, are you listening, Matthew? I hope so. Couldn't find y'all weekend while we were frying our brains out of Tappywood all of that.

[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:41.340]
See, I live in an apartment. Everybody becomes a developer down here. Everybody's a developer. And they slap up a few concrete, can I say erections? I can't say that. And that's it.

[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:53.740]
And they get away with the cheapest and the worst. A lot of these guys, and they put in an air conditioning unit that isn't big enough to handle the space. They put in a water heater, a hot water heater that isn't big enough to handle the needs.

[00:12:54.840 --> 00:13:04.380]
And see, I've got to try effective where I'm living now. The plumbing doesn't work. In fact, when somebody in another part of the building, can I say this delicately, or does it have to do with excretory matters?

[00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:13.340]
When they flush, sometimes certain things come up in your bowl, okay? And you wonder, who did that? You know, what was that all about?

[00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:24.760]
Is that great? Undergarments come up. I mean, like, at various times, it's exciting. Then, of course, the water pressure, you know, you're there taking a shower.

[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:33.300]
I don't know about you, but when I get up in the morning, I got to have a good, strong shower to wake up and to inspire me to come in here. In fact, probably a good, strong drink would be even better.

[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:44.880]
But anyway, it's like if somebody in another part of the building, not even in the same apartment, if they turn on the water, you know, like if they're getting a glass of water, all of a sudden it's like you're dancing under the raindrops to try to stay wet.

[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:54.200]
Although, I guess, our minor things, right? But of course, now that it's getting hot, and we had about three really hot days in a row when it got over 85.

[00:13:55.360 --> 00:14:03.520]
My air conditioner and it grinds. You can hear it churning. You can hear the rodents and they're really running around trying to get going fast enough. It doesn't work.

[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:08.880]
It's only cold at night. After it gets under 70 outside, then it gets freezing.

[00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:15.840]
But during the daytime, when it gets like over 80 degrees, it doesn't work. It gets maybe down to 78 inside, and that's it.

[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:21.720]
And of course, it runs all day now, which means you're paying electric to run it all day, and it's not cooling off.

[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:31.380]
And there's nobody in the office. There's nobody home. There's nobody around this place. This is another joke. It's just another cruel joke that they play on people.

[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.700]
And people are moving out of this complex left and right.

[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:45.020]
And this guy who rented it to me has the gold joke to me that, well, the place I move into is brand new. Somebody lived in there for a couple of months, but they ran out on him.

[00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:58.460]
He says, they ran out on it. They probably ran out screaming in the middle of the night. Probably somebody, well, I don't want to get in delicate this early in the morning, but I can just imagine some of the things that probably came up in the old magic bowl.

[00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:04.520]
You know what I'm saying? I heard that the circus was in town up the street. Larry can't once work with a circus, didn't they?

[00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.840]
How'd you like to have him sitting on your throne, huh?

[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:12.380]
Oh, boy. Holy Toledo. Holy moly.

[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:23.700]
I remember these to talk to people from the country used to talk about the old twin-holars out in the woods.

[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:27.220]
Larry would need a triple decker.

[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:33.460]
Man, they just have to cut a big hole in the ground for him, I guess.

[00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:42.080]
Anyway, we'll get into that a little bit later. Hope you're listening, Matthew. I hope you came back from your bar mitzvah, wherever it was that you were.

[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:51.120]
Because in a couple of days, this kid's going to be long gone, and I want my deposit back. I want all my money back, baby. I want everything back.

[00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:58.360]
You know, you just get to the point you get tired of being screwed over. I think that's where I finally reached.

[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:02.480]
You know, and as I've told you before, I have no sales resistance. I'm a bad consumer.

[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:09.860]
I buy something that doesn't work. I throw it out. I don't take it back or if I buy something at the market, it turns out to be rotten. I throw it away.

[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.240]
I just have no consumer defense.

[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:21.480]
But even the weak need like yours truly, you reach a certain point in life, and you just say I've been abused and screwed enough.

[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:26.160]
Let me say it again. I've been screwed enough.

[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:31.840]
I have never been to a prostitute and I am not or have ever been a homosexual.

[00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:39.320]
Okay. Now, getting back to a Saturday, Saturday morning, really, I don't think in three and a half hours I can do justice to this. I'm serious.

[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:45.380]
Saturday morning, and the amazing part of it is we had a meeting, the talk hosts.

[00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:53.820]
Do I dare use that term here at WINZ? We had a meeting a couple of weeks ago after months of my suggesting it would be nice if we sat down and figured, you know, what the hell we're doing.

[00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:59.920]
We had a meeting and we just talked about this thing at CD Smith Park on Saturday and what we were going to do there.

[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:06.880]
And I said, well, we haven't done this talk. Maybe a thing for a year and a half. Why don't we get everybody to come on out? We'll have a little fun.

[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:12.420]
I didn't realize how little fun it was going to be, but I said, let's have a little bit of fun.

[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:20.460]
Do you realize that the radio station wouldn't run one promo for this? The only promo that ran on this station about CD Smith Park were those pumpernix promos?

[00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.800]
Well, I don't think we know. But it looks really good.

[00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:32.000]
Yes, it was very early. I mean, I would tell you not to insist next night.

[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.460]
The reason I eventually dropped it is not that I don't care about the hungry and the homeless. It's a very important subject to me.

[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:44.760]
But we got no cooperation. And then like three months later, after I was no longer involved, there were management people coming in.

[00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:49.160]
I said, hey, the sleep out was great. I said, what are you talking about? That's Mike. I got nothing to do with that.

[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:55.180]
It's kind of like you're off just floating off in the keys somewhere, you know, like with Ron Harrison.

[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:59.720]
It's like you're just off on a limb. And it was the same thing with this talk, Mania.

[00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:07.740]
I thought we could have a lot of fun. I thought we get a lot of people out to sign petitions, which we did. We got 350 signatures, which isn't sensational, but that's not bad.

[00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:13.960]
Although a couple of people there made a good point. A couple of the people who came out said we're really disappointed at the turnout.

[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:18.680]
I mean, after all, this is the first amendment. This is the bicentennial year of the Constitution.

[00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:23.840]
So certainly, people ought to really be concerned about this issue, but you got to understand.

[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:31.860]
First of all, nobody even knows where CB Smith Park is. Number one, number two, we were in Pavilion 5, which was between here and the Okie-Fanokie swamps.

[00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:35.680]
And number three, people if they didn't live in Pembroke Pines had a pay to get in.

[00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:49.580]
In spite of what this clown from Pumpernix was telling everybody, breakfast at Pumpernix with Neil, free Danish and free coffee.

[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:58.260]
And I get there and there's nobody there. It's like when the Godfather was in the hospital and they took all the guards away, that's how I felt.

[00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:03.740]
There's nobody there. I mean, there are people there, but there's nobody there from the station. There's no security there.

[00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:06.740]
And I park way out in the Boundox because there's no other parking.

[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:14.700]
And I walked very quickly to go inside because you've got to remember this place is not too far from Century Village, number one.

[00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.680]
That speaks for itself and right up the block from Colony Point.

[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:26.080]
And I go inside and hear these rather bizarre people who run this place and I looked around and said, hey, this is still the Royal Market cafeteria.

[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:29.660]
With a different name.

[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:38.020]
I mean, it looks like Pumpernix, like I look like Paul Newman. You know what I mean? That's how the similarity just says that on a name.

[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:47.820]
See, that's a new thing now. We have a whole new thing. People are bringing back like the famous. You know, we put up a sign.

[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:59.440]
And the Lindy's, there's another good one, right? I'm not going to beat around a bush anymore. I'm going to tell it like it is because I've been embarrassed by some of these people more than enough. I've been abused enough.

[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:11.480]
In fact, we could also do a couple of hours today. You know, you talk about trying to find an edible place. I don't mean edible in that you're going to chew on the building. Although some of them you could chew on the wood, it would be better.

[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.340]
This town is pathetic. You can't find a place to eat.

[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:21.260]
I wind up eating lunch yesterday at Venegans on Sheridan Street.

[00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:32.460]
The only reason I didn't go to the deli then is because, you know, it was going to be packed. It was right at lunchtime in addition to which I feel squeamish about eating it in my sponsors because they make a big fuss and they won't let me pay.

[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:37.040]
And as Jim Baker says, I pay for everything.

[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:47.620]
And of course, at Venegans, it's like a step away from TGI Fridays. I mean, everything is made out of a cheese and plastic and polyester.

[00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:58.760]
Even the plates are made out of polyester. It's incredible. Everything is prefabricated. And the potatoes taste just like the linguine.

[00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:14.020]
It really is. It's almost impossible to find a place to eat in this town. Really is. I mean, yeah, there are some good restaurants. But first of all, most of them are open for lunch.

[00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:21.080]
And on Sunday, wouldn't you think Sunday would be a day that a lot of people would eat out, a lot of families. It isn't most other towns. It's a big day.

[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:30.360]
Not here. Must have a lot of majong tournaments on Sunday or something here. I don't know what the hell goes on on Sunday, man. It's like death.

[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:31.640]
Death.

[00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:41.560]
So anyway, I'm inside. And this guy says, well, before you go out and talk to all your people out there, and there were a considerable number of people.

[00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:51.100]
I hop is packed on Sunday. Oh, you got to be pulling my leg. I hop is like that's a step below desperate. That's how bad I hop is.

[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:59.560]
All of them. I hop is one of those chains that years ago, it's like the New England oyster house. Years ago, used to be really pretty good.

[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:10.300]
And after X number of years goes by, I don't know what it is that happens, but all of a sudden they get new management or new something. And man, I'm going to tell you it's just unbelievably bad.

[00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:11.580]
Horrendous.

[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:29.460]
And all of these people are milling around outside and this one old guy is screaming and yelling. And you know, and this madness and other guy inside says to me, well, before you go out there and talk to your people, I'd like to have you say hello to the people who paid to eat breakfast this morning.

[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:38.100]
In other words, the people who were inside and they were pretty well packed eating breakfast. And I said to them, I said, those people don't know who I am. They didn't come here to see me.

[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:47.740]
Oh, no, you're wrong. You're right. So now he grabs me by the arm and he takes me into the other room, which is like two feet away. You know, I mean, it's like it's like eating in a shoe box. This little tiny place.

[00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:55.180]
And here all these people eating and they're not even looking up. They don't know me from Moishi Pupik, okay? And I'm standing there like some kind of a moron.

[00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:04.420]
Now he says, okay, well, let's go outside and you know, say hello to all your people.

[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:13.560]
I know we're a lot of nice people out there, although most of them were very old. What do you expect at Pumpernix? Is that a place where you're going to find a lot of teenagers? Not too likely.

[00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:18.500]
I mean, the youngest teenager was 97 out there, but there were a lot of nice people and here was this one guy.

[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:29.280]
Oh, that's it. Screaming and yelling and carrying on. And I'm not exaggerating. He never stopped for a minute. And the irony of it is he had his free Danish in one hand.

[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:40.740]
How do you like that? He took one of the free Danish, okay, that they were giving from my audience. And he was doing disgusting things with it to top it all off.

[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:49.100]
And I'm thinking, geez, I got to get that out of there. Now these people are all milling around and now they got to bring out the chef.

[00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:56.880]
Here's my chef who used to work at Wolfies on 21st and the guy comes out and he's got the blood stains on his apron and blood stains on his forehead.

[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:03.900]
And here's another guy that comes out, hey, this is Rafael from the kitchen. We just found him in a boat somewhere. And he comes out great.

[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:10.340]
Okay. And now this one guy is screaming and whirling in circles and his head is spinning around like Linda Blair in the exercise.

[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:16.300]
I mean, it's okay, get me the hell out of here. Will you please? So now they're all escorting me to my car.

[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:22.000]
And at that point, I began to get the feeling that something was not kosher in Denmark. You know what I'm saying?

[00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:26.660]
Now we get out to my car and I said, hey, wait a minute. What's that flat tire there?

[00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:34.700]
And now I look at the back one on the left side. Now we got two flat tires. And of course, we go around to the other side and hear the other two.

[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:43.280]
All four perfect match. I mean, I want to give credit to this miserable old fart who did this. He did it very evenly. He was an equal opportunity deflater.

[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:50.060]
And here my car is sitting there and it's just like, you know, sunk to the ground and the tires are flat as a pancake.

[00:24:52.000 --> 00:25:03.160]
And the manager of this alleged pumper next is saying, oh, oh, this is terrible. We feel so bad. And everybody is twitching and quitching and, okay, don't worry about a thing.

[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:16.180]
I'll ride you over to the park. We'll get you there. We'll take care of this by the time you come back. Whatever you want. We'll bring the car back to you. We'll take care. It's always pop-a-pop. Beep-beep. Great. He drives me over to the park.

[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:22.480]
And at this point, I'm ready to blow my brains out. I mean, you know, is this a good way to start a Saturday morning? This is a great way to start today.

[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:34.660]
I tell you what, let's do another break because there's just too much of the story. When we come back, I'll pick it up at the park where the engineers are standing there looking off into space, wondering what the hell, how we got sucked into this.

[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:40.460]
And we're some of our programming people are standing there with their finger up their nose. I'll pick it up right at that point when we come back.

[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:49.140]
I have never been to a prostitute and I am not or have ever been a homosexual.

[00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:56.600]
It's 1041 at W.I.N.C. By the way, you know why Jerry Falwell always has that silly grin on his face. We just found that out this morning from Reverend Anchorburg.

[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:03.580]
Jerry has a dildo in the shape of a cross on his body that he wears at all times. I'm not a liberty to tell you where.

[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:13.960]
Okay, now getting back to Saturday morning. I think we had just arrived at the park if I'm not mistaken. My tires were flat. This clown from Pumperdix just brings me to the pavilion.

[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:22.300]
And I get out of the car and I'm just terminally depressed and I'm not in any mood to hear any crap from anybody at this point. I just want to go home to be honest with you.

[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:27.820]
And all of a sudden this old guy comes up. You know one of these that tears you by the arm. You know that keeps grabbing you.

[00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:37.380]
I don't want to be grabbed by old guys. Okay, I mean if I want you to grab me I'll let you know. I'll give you a little wink or something like me show, but not some old fart who smells bad and got bad breath.

[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:47.000]
Okay, and this guy's grabbing me and now he's telling me about Duf. He's telling me some cock-a-many story about Duf's and about they're opening up a new Morrison's and the Ancesthes cafeteria.

[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:51.380]
And I can't get away from this guy. Now I'm ready to belt him in the mouth at this point. Okay.

[00:26:53.240 --> 00:27:01.140]
So finally all the rest of my cohorts are getting you know they're arriving getting ready to join me in four hours of humiliation, degradation and embarrassment.

[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:10.460]
And we start to sit down at 10 o'clock and I said okay, where's the sodas? Because I'm one of those people who I can't go on the year unless I've got something even when they do a debate.

[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:18.020]
You notice all these even these pseudo intellectuals sit there and they've got a big picture of ice water and they have their own individual glass of water in the whole business.

[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:26.680]
It's just common sense that when somebody's going to talk for a prolonged period of time they've got to have something to wet their whistle, so to speak.

[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:43.160]
What's out of what? I mean this thing was planned out so well as to be just mind-boggling. Okay. So now I'm digging in my pocket feeling the change and I have to come up with about $3 in change to send somebody over to the soda machine to get a half a dozen sodas for those of us on the year.

[00:27:44.160 --> 00:28:03.000]
At that point I look around keep in mind I've just had four tires flat and I've also had this encounter with a screaming maniac who made Linda Blair look like a good sister and this guy is running around like I'm lunatic in front of Puppernick and I've got this all fresh in my mind and I said okay, where's the security?

[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:16.400]
There isn't any security. It's because security cost money and one thing about our sales manager here and the whole you know brilliant staff that we've got of what should we call them?

[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:24.420]
Well I can't use that word on the air all of our administrative types all of our executives and bureaucrats here they don't they want to get away as cheaply as possible.

[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:35.780]
In other words let's go out make the big hit grab the money and run that's a bottom line and it cost money to do that so we don't care the fact that we've got the whole staff practically sitting there in one place like a target.

[00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:42.420]
Okay. Which is something else to think about because here are these hundreds of people milling around.

[00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:58.220]
This is the same sales manager by the way after we did the remote at the diplomat mall in Halendale after we received $50 million worth of free publicity for this radio station about the early bird dinners in Halendale and the whole business who comes in here with a straight face and says to me.

[00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:04.780]
Well, I need a we like to this going to be a lot of fun. We're going to take out the century village and let them let's raise some money for radio aid.

[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:11.740]
And we'll let them bob your you for apples. We'll let do a dunking contest with you and let them throw apples at you.

[00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:20.080]
I mean this man needs to be put into a straight jacket and locked away somewhere right.

[00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:31.840]
I mean I got a much better idea. Why don't we just get the sales manager to go out in front of this building. We'll go up 47th Avenue and we'll put me on one of those big wheels like the wheel of fortune.

[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:37.520]
You know, but like one of those big circular wheels you seen that with Sherlock Holmes. They used to do that to him all the time.

[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:46.880]
And they just put me on the wheel and we'll charge you a bucket shot. You know until somebody finally some good shot comes along and hits the mark.

[00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:54.740]
Now speaking of hitting the mark. There's the guy we got to put on the spinning wheel right mark. You said it. Put him on there.

[00:29:55.380 --> 00:30:00.580]
In fact, we're going to do two of them. We're going to have Mark Cue in the first wheel and Chris back on the second wheel. We'll do a quinella.

[00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:07.080]
We're going to take him right on Palm Avenue and anybody out there wants a little target practice. Come on by folks. We're doing it right at high noon.

[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:14.800]
We'll show those bureaucrats a thing or two right now. They don't go out there and put their ass on the line. They sit in there. They're little bureaucratic meetings and you know, well,

[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:22.400]
she and we didn't got this high and we didn't got this tea. You know, I mean let's get serious put their ass out there on the line once.

[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:29.300]
Then what really was bad on Saturday after all of this then the show started that was really that was the worst.

[00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:37.980]
Well, see the worst came after two o'clock. Most people don't even know about that part which I'll get to when I'm good and ready. You know what I'm saying? Then the show started.

[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:54.660]
Four hours of that 50,000 watts for four hours. You believe that those people over in Naples must have wondered if Russia was invading. Did I light up all the lights? Good.

[00:30:55.380 --> 00:31:02.640]
Let's light up all the lights in a control room today. Lights that have been sitting there stagnating for years. All of a sudden will.

[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:10.720]
We'll bring them to life today like we're in an amusement park like we're in some kind of a carnival on them trying to see how many of those lights I can light up.

[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:17.700]
Do we get points for that? Do we add to the ratings when they come out? Spread them around to some of the other day parts from what I hear they might need it.

[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:27.060]
Spread them around the foul or he might need to borrow a couple to unbelievable. So now we go on the air and I guess there's not much I can say about that because nobody had anything to say and I couldn't hear anybody.

[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:33.660]
Couldn't hear anybody and then they kept saying well here use the headset and I put the headset on and then got real embarrassing because then I could hear it.

[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:43.680]
And I didn't want to hear it. I mean you know when you put the headset on and you hear you know you hear that you want to take it off immediately and I did I said hey listen I much rather sit here and just mumble.

[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:49.620]
And so while I did was I just signed those pictures for about two hours that killed a lot of time. Here you go. Get out of my way.

[00:31:50.440 --> 00:32:05.800]
And I kept listening and nobody was saying anything and Ernie was running around doing his Phil Donahue imitation it was incredible until a pastrami in corn be for arrived and all of a sudden he pulled out his mizuzin was blessing it and just I have never seen anybody.

[00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:12.780]
Pack it away like that man. No wonder he's so Jewish. I mean when you eat that much pastrami it's got to make every part of your inner it's blessed.

[00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:22.840]
When they open up Ernie to do an operation they're going to find stamped inside his liver a little circle you on all of his organs I'm telling you even on that organ his wife told us the other day.

[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:36.040]
That it was like a little circle you I think she wasn't describing the emblem she was describing the size and of course Kathy West I mean I got news for you honey maybe you never stole a freight train but boy oh boy she was.

[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:46.360]
The one guy said it best he said she was a moron you know I mean he said it the best the one guy in the crowd he was he was right on target I mean Kathy is just hopeless.

[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:54.520]
How what's all this money for what are we called I'm worried about this so what is this like I'm going to take the money and steal it right like I went and bought my tires with the money.

[00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:05.820]
Like I'm going to put 28 years in the business down the toilet on you know 300 and some odd dollars and by the way we appreciate all the people who were so generous and even the ones who were cheap you know.

[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:27.840]
Anything at this point would help. Did you get permission to play those tapes I mean you know here is a woman trust me what I tell you this who needs to have something in her mouth all the time just to keep her from speaking and I really mean that and whatever it is you want to put in her mouth you've got my permission because I got news for you boy the minute she opens it it just regurgitates.

[00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:48.220]
God is she incredible huh and there was Taffy I believe in capital punishment and I believe you know as if anybody doesn't know already you know what I'm saying and she just kept saying it over and over again and we're just trashing her all over the place and she just sitting there repeating the same thing about Ted Bundy and she wants to pull the switch.

[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:51.520]
Oh God.

[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:59.660]
Mary you don't left early you know what I said he just disappeared he you know he just took off I don't know what his story was.

[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:18.280]
The bottom line it was an embarrassing four hours embarrassing this radio station owes an apology to the entire community for the abomination that broadcast on 940 on Saturday the Ernie Sochenshow we also apologize for the park but that's another story.

[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:32.160]
Did Ernie plug our campaign at all on Saturday no see he's got his own agenda if we had called it so far so Jewish then it would have been okay then he would have pushed it for five hours but he

[00:34:34.200 --> 00:35:02.020]
would have put it on the other side of the park and he would have put it on the other side of the park and he would have put it on the other side of the park and he would have put it on the other side of the park and he would have put it on the other side of the park and he would have put it on the other side of the park and he would have put it on the other side of the park and he would have put it on the other side of the park and he would have put it on the other side of the park and he would have put it on the other side of the park and he would have put it on the other side of the park and he would have put it on the other side of the park and he would have put it on the other side of the park and he would have put it on the other side of the park and he would have put it on the other side of the park and he would have put it on the other side of the park and he would have put it on the other side of the park and he

[00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:32.000]
would have put it on the other side of the park and he would have put it on the other side of the park and the park and they would have put it on the other side of the park and they would have put it on the other bite of the oven and they would have put it on the other side of the park and they would have put it on the other side

[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.800]
again because boy I don't know how we do it. I don't know how we do it. It's a phantom

[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:45.120]
by word of mouth. But this show has so far demolished the competition. We have a seven

[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:58.560]
share in midday. A seven. That would be like having a 14 share at night. Our competition

[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:11.480]
put together has a four eight put together. WIOD in midday has a 2.4. WNWS in midday has a 2.4 share

[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:18.400]
of the audience. In other words we have on this show about three times as many people listening

[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:24.880]
as either of those stations do at any given time. Let's just make some more gutterable sounds for

[00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:29.300]
a little while. Let's have a little celebration. It's like Saturday in the park by Chicago.

[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:35.180]
Have we got that? No. Even on the FN they don't have that. See you up. Well no wait a minute.

[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:40.760]
Didn't Terry Cath blow his brains out a few years ago from Chicago. See they play all the dead

[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:44.100]
artists on the FN. I told them that this morning I played a lot of Jim Morrison, a lot of

[00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:48.760]
a Janis Chaplin, Jimmy Hendrix. And that's because they have the new brain dead format on Zeta.

[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.520]
And I told them they're on the right track now. They finally are getting with it.

[00:36:55.020 --> 00:37:01.060]
How come I can't find them on the sheet? No, no, no, no, come on. They must have gone up,

[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:07.960]
gone down, come on. Well anyway the ratings are running. I want to belabor that point but as soon as

[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:12.280]
I can get a copy that I can read I will pass it along to you and let you know what's going on in

[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:17.540]
the market because Tom Jic is going to be here as a matter of fact on Thursday is it? Yeah,

[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:23.140]
Thursday the whole show from 10 to 2 on the 30th of April. And that's always a real barn burner.

[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:26.940]
Won't be great because we'll have the whole book by then and we can sit here and celebrate

[00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:31.180]
and be self-indulgent. And what does that tell you? Sonny Rosenberg?

[00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:37.220]
Wonder what Lee Fowler did? Of course we don't have the hour by hour breakdown. We only have the

[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:43.520]
day parts but I sure would love to see what Lee Fowler does from 1 to 3. He probably brings

[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:50.880]
Rand Taldon about a point and a half I would think. Well let's see. WIOD has a 3.1.

[00:37:52.780 --> 00:38:01.380]
WNWS has a 3.5 and WINZ. We have a 5 chair. So on behalf of our brain dead management I want to

[00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:06.140]
thank everybody out there because we really knocked them dead in his book. Now what is the sales

[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:09.720]
department going to be saying about that? Oh it's a fluke. It's another one of those flukes.

[00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:14.860]
Nobody will believe it now. Forget it. I guess we're having bad shape now for another three months.

[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:21.480]
Isn't that what they said last summer when we had a 5-1? The fluke was in the fall. Right?

[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:27.820]
Not really but it sounds good. That was the fluke. I mean we're just killing them.

[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:33.200]
And after hearing Saturday's performance it's got to be mind-boggling isn't it? I mean the fact

[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:37.960]
that so many people are tuning in WIOD and Z. I mean just wait till we get some good people on the

[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:41.160]
air. Man then we're really going to knock ass in his town. You know what I'm saying?

[00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:44.460]
Especially here in midday. Wait till we get somebody good in on this show.

[00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:50.460]
Like Jack McDermott. Hello friends.

[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:57.360]
Okay now let's get to Bill Cosford's column. I would read you a lot more from the ratings but

[00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:01.880]
Mark Hume made me copies here that nobody can read. He gave me these two real light copies.

[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:06.580]
If you want to know about WNVM they had a .7.

[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:12.660]
But Lee Fowler gets saved again. Can you believe that life had a 9? Doesn't that tell you a lot

[00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:20.400]
about this market? Life had a 9. Can't believe that. How could we have had a 7?

[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:28.900]
In midday and still not the number 1. Did life beat us in midday? Oh yeah. Oh boy.

[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:35.360]
You know what they had in midday? They had an 11.6 share in midday.

[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:42.700]
You know what that means? It means that old-y old farts have turned on a lifeless in midday.

[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:48.000]
See we wanted to get rid of those people anyway. I mean nobody should advertise on that station

[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.620]
because all they do is play elevator music in the background. Nobody pays any attention to it.

[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:57.800]
If you waste a dime with advertising on WLYF you might as well be burning it because nobody listens.

[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:03.800]
In fact really there ought to be a log instead of whole thing because they get credit for people

[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:09.620]
who are in dentist offices and doctors offices, secretaries and you know they get a die.

[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:13.220]
Really put it down that they're listening to it. All it really means is that it's on in the

[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:18.260]
background. They're not paying any attention. If I got in the year on life right now and I started

[00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:23.100]
ranting and raving. If I did the whole same first hour that I did on this show nobody would know

[00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:27.740]
the difference. Of course there would have to probably be a little bit you know something in the

[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:33.680]
background. I'm serious if I did all the ranting and raving in the first hour. As long as we had that

[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:42.360]
in the background nobody would know the difference. Just imagine if we can do a seven

[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:47.280]
with the show that we've been doing if we would put this in the background let's see what's 11,

[00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:54.560]
6 and 7 that's 18. We can put them together. Let's take over the FM what we'll do is we'll do

[00:40:54.560 --> 00:41:01.560]
life out of one channel and my show out of the other channel. This maybe ink is out there running

[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:06.960]
around in the parking lot screaming and yelling. Can you just hear that? Now that would be a format

[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:13.180]
huh that would be a killer killer format. Get rid of them will you please with a violence?

[00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:18.460]
Okay I want to get to build cost-friars column if I can. I'm sorry that we're taking up so much time

[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:23.500]
but of course otherwise you'd be listening to the boring callers. How loud Neil congratulations

[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.600]
you're the best. Stuff it lady that's all I can tell you you know I mean it's real nice all

[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:34.300]
compliments but nobody wants to hear that crap okay they want to hear somebody say something

[00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:39.580]
and Bill Cosford I said before the news break that he's grown a couple of inches in all of our eyes

[00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:43.620]
and from what we hear and of course Bill is kind of a short what is he about five seven?

[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:50.120]
Five three kind of a short kind of begin with and from what we understand from those who know

[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:54.080]
him the best take it or for another couple of inches can't hurt it would be a delicate way of saying it

[00:41:55.380 --> 00:42:00.960]
and the headline in his column in yesterday's Harold brain police zero in on radio

[00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:09.440]
quote warning this column contains words phrases and perhaps a concept or two that may be

[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:15.640]
offensive to some you know who you are stop here let us briefly consider Howard Stern

[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:23.240]
Howard Stern is a New York area radio personality with a foul mouth and a huge audience the two

[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:28.600]
are not unrelated if you haven't heard howard you cannot fully appreciate the nature of his

[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:33.120]
appeal though you can approximate it think of Archie bunker only a bit more scandalous and a

[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:38.820]
hell of a lot smarter Howard Stern is at the very epicenter of the decision by the FCC to warn radio

[00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:44.520]
stations that certain things words in you window the radio equivalent of a lear will no longer be

[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:50.080]
tolerated Stern's show on morning drive time on an FM station that serves greater New York has

[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:55.700]
apparently drawn no complaints there but the shows simul cast into more tender Philadelphia inspired

[00:42:55.700 --> 00:43:02.900]
69 letters to complain to the FCC what does Howard Stern do he tries as hard as he can to offend

[00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:08.620]
people in the process since taking offense implicitly suggests a certain vulnerability he makes a great

[00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:14.640]
many other people laugh a typical Stern routine is lesbian dilatate another is loving appraisal

[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:20.700]
of his on the ear side kicks breasts a third is the use of preteen euphemisms for body parts

[00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:26.520]
clearly Stern show is a send up the comedy is directly from the school yard even to its delivery

[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:32.500]
which when Stern is on is a whiny snickering voice that reminds you of the days in your life

[00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:38.740]
when saying kaka and boobs was a no no I think Stern is hilarious there's no accounting for taste in

[00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:43.420]
any case we can blame this latest attempt by our own government to determine what will be allowed

[00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:49.560]
we will be allowed to see or hear or read directly on Stern he has annoyed people it's possible

[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:54.500]
that the 69 a no ease were merely friends and family of Stern's rivals in the Philadelphia

[00:43:54.500 --> 00:44:00.280]
broadcasting market but in any case the FCC has put him and everybody else who is tempted to broadcast

[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:06.940]
naughty on notice they are listening locally Stern has at least one ardent fan Neil Rogers not

[00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:12.540]
coincidentally the most popular English language AM radio personality in San Florida has heard tapes

[00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:18.000]
of Stern has been inspired to spice up his own act Neil now says douchebag more than he used to

[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:24.500]
and old fart like Stern Rogers has reacted to the FCC action by counter attack he has volunteers

[00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:29.400]
from his audience stuffing envelopes with petitions and hopes to engage broadcasters across the

[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:35.820]
country in a protest unlike Stern Rogers prime intent is not to offend it still doesn't do to

[00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:41.560]
cross him or even to bore him lest he grows a testy but Rogers is a talk show host rather than a

[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:46.980]
stick man he is also a prominent liberal voice here Rogers and Stern do share one of the

[00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:51.840]
experience however and that is that some of the people who do not like them are not content to

[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:57.940]
refrain from listening but insist that they be taken off the air it is this small minority for which

[00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:04.100]
the FCC is taken up arms as has become customary this latest free speech attack comes with save the

[00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:10.280]
children justification as well as the community standards dodge we must protect children from radio

[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:15.860]
says the commission because radio is pervasive well yes assuming the kids have one in our listening

[00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:20.780]
to it interestingly Rogers and Stern around the year during school hours when the five and over

[00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:27.180]
is presumably are in class not huddled around the boom box as for the under five show me a four-year

[00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:32.220]
old who skips Sesame Street for morning drive and I'll show you a kid with bigger problems than

[00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:37.960]
nasty Neil and community standards the rating speak eloquently for those where Stern and Rogers are

[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:43.480]
heard they are tremendously popular the issue of course is not kids or community standards at all

[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:48.080]
its adults even if it were plausible that the likes of Rogers and Stern could pollute our

[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:52.720]
listening youth it would be then incumbent on parents to restrict the listening not on government

[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:57.780]
to limit adult listening to the norms of pre-kindergarten the issue is that some adults continue

[00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:03.420]
to want to make other adults conform to a narrow idea of what is good for them few would deny that

[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:09.060]
Howard Stern pushes the limits or that Neil Rogers can be insulting can rile people few would

[00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:13.320]
deny that either is capable of flirting with the bounds of good taste if not trampling them out

[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:19.300]
right so what isn't that allowed after all the FCC has said time and again that it is not concerned

[00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:24.880]
with content after all of his said time and again under the Reagan administration that it wants to

[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:30.280]
deregulate broadcasting to remove it as much as possible from government control after all it is

[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:34.560]
indifferent to the advertise of assault on children during their prime weekend TV viewing hours

[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:39.400]
and says nothing about the waves of debauchery that boy the daytime soaps during the week

[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:45.740]
it cannot be a matter merely of good taste can it it can indeed in a heralded tutorial supporting

[00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:51.400]
the FCC decision and in one of the saddest sentences I have ever read in this newspaper the game

[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:57.220]
is given away quote perhaps the decision will help define the bounds of good taste end of quote

[00:46:57.220 --> 00:47:02.560]
and there we are good taste is defined by the federal government the same government that can

[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:07.500]
even run a simple central American gun running scam without screwing it up they are the ones who

[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:13.360]
will tell us what's in good taste and we don't have to do a thing we need a reem or two of petitions

[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:22.500]
Neil and hurry end of article by Bill Cosford in yesterday's Miami herald and I told a Lori

[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:27.480]
Sheffield today my producer I said let's send out a bunch more of the petitions to bill over at the

[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:32.540]
herald and knowing how gutsy he is he probably circulate him over in the building there at one

[00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:37.220]
herald plaza they've got hundreds of people they've even got more people to work there than we do

[00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:42.540]
here which is almost impossible even Sony doesn't have as many Japanese running around as we have

[00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:47.400]
working in this building I don't mean Japanese I mean employees boy tapping you're really upset

[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:51.520]
but I think Bill Cosford for the con boards and he really hits it right on the head

[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:58.860]
and how about that line that one line in one of the saddest sentences I have ever read in this

[00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:05.440]
newspaper is that really described that pathetic gutless herald editorial in essence what the

[00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:08.840]
hero is saying hey yeah go ahead you can restrict what broadcasters can say and you can

[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:13.780]
determine guidelines for them but don't ever try it with us because we've already been into the

[00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:17.500]
court with Pat Trinillo it will all right it will go into court over and over again with anybody

[00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:22.360]
else who tries to take away our right to do whatever the hell we want but go ahead and regulate

[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:29.720]
everybody else because that's good for us it's good for business okay boy I've been rambling

[00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:35.060]
on here like a lunatic 21 past 11 we haven't even taken a call yet should we now well let's give

this morning but we still have two open lines here 764 0707 and Broward what that's incredible

[00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:15.280]

[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:21.020]
at any morning at pumpa nex well I apologize sir yeah especially for that idiot in the street but

[00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:26.660]
it's not worth even to talk about him it's just one funny thing that happened I also came to

[00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:32.200]
the park later on of course I didn't pay but after everything was over two o'clock when everyone

[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:44.440]
left yeah I had stood around I was talking to some other people and I saw the barricades were

[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:50.080]
the wildest lettuce all the old food that was left over yeah well they don't know but we poisoned

[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:55.420]
all of that before we left we sprayed it with piracuade I mean they were taking like the radio

[00:49:55.420 --> 00:50:01.520]
copy the papers that were on the floor yeah I mean they like animals animals through everything there

[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:10.580]
yeah really incredible but we enjoyed your show and just my wife and I are concerned and the

[00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:17.000]
station should be very concerned that you know your your health and well-being going on to the

[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.640]
public yeah well they're very concerned about me now because the rating the book just came out now

[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:24.960]
all of a sudden they're all uh patting me on the back and running in here and peeing all over my

[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:29.280]
shoes I just had to change my shoes during the commercial break so uh they'll be real nice to me

[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:35.100]
now until the next book yeah and if the thing uh uh Kathy West I think you're too easy on her yeah

[00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:40.200]
I'm gonna start I know more no more Saturday stick with her I'll tell you that you've heard the last

[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:45.980]
of that sir thanks okay that's a good work thank you okay we have an open line in date now two

[00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:49.680]
of them as a matter of fact somebody just passed out when they heard about the seven share who was

[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:56.400]
out on the line was that Al's mother six two four oh one nine one is our number in date count if we

[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:59.880]
have anybody alive and breathing I mean how the hell could we not be you know setting them on a

[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:05.480]
fire this morning even just the guttural sounds we made were more exciting than Sandy's guest six

[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:10.700]
two four oh one nine one let's go to Miami hello good morning Neil how are you okay Neil I've

[00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:16.720]
been a listener to talk radio for quite a long time this is the first time I've called I would say

[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:21.640]
that the state of talk radio here in this city is quite lacking I know that you have some

[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:27.380]
differences with other talkos and other stations but I'll tell you to summarize it briefly I believe

[00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:32.720]
that you were quality I believe that Steve is interesting and that Al is interesting but beyond

[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:38.040]
that you could take the rest and flush them down the toilet and it would make no matter the rest

[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:46.300]
or mediocre at best they just don't seem to have the sharpness or the wit to keep the format

[00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:50.220]
interesting no matter what they're discussing well first of all the idea that anybody who's

[00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:55.720]
breathing is a radio talk show host is an insult to the business and to the audience and unfortunately

[00:51:55.720 --> 00:52:00.640]
there are people in this market in a position the higher folks who have slapped the audience in the

[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:06.740]
face by taking people off the street or taking people out of positions in which they were totally

[00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:11.980]
unqualified to become talk show host and say proof you were a talk host and I got news for you

[00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:17.560]
and I don't have to tell you it doesn't work well I can't make gold out of chop liver I'll agree with

[00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:21.780]
you there let me ask you one question about you know would you take a shot let's say it's somebody

[00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:26.640]
at your own station how do you get along with them off the air let's say you see them in the hallway

[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:31.600]
no I can't you got to understand this as the godfather said you know you can't take it

[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:36.540]
personally it's business and I like all of the people here well most of the people in the building

[00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:40.940]
all of the people on the air I get along with well and we all you know speak we don't

[00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:44.900]
sleep together or anything but we're all friendly and we all I think like each other but in terms

[00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:49.400]
of what some of them do on the air or in terms of some of their subject matter what I say on the

[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:53.700]
air is what I really believe and do they how do they react to you when you see them off the air

[00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:57.420]
there's no problem there's no hurt feelings let's say with Kathy for instance what you said

[00:52:57.420 --> 00:53:03.180]
today would she you know well I have no idea but I mean what she did to me on Saturday I wouldn't

[00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:07.780]
do that anybody I mean even somebody on another station I mean we just the here were involved

[00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:11.360]
you got to know where to draw the line when you're doing something that's humorous that's great

[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:16.640]
but when you're doing something you believe in and you're trying to really rally people around it

[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:20.520]
and she sits there's an where's all that money going I want to know why do we need money for this

[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:25.200]
you know and she was serious she wasn't joking she was serious I mean that was about as funny

[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:31.000]
as cancer well I'll tell you the program that you're referring to I listened to oh and I was very

[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:37.460]
disappointed when normally at least when you have a group let's say in a studio you don't have as

[00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:41.800]
many outside distractions but I'll tell you something when they were taking questions from the

[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:46.600]
audience half the time you couldn't even hear what the questions were yeah and it seemed like

[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:51.960]
there was no scene running from one segment to another yeah just like odds and ends coming up

[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:56.120]
everybody had a lot you know nobody wanted to say anything Saturday and I just I felt like I was

[00:53:56.120 --> 00:54:00.640]
just drowning like I wanted somebody to throw me a life preserver and I just couldn't believe

[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:04.400]
what was going on but I think it may have served one useful purpose because the powers that be

[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:10.160]
around here have learned from that debacle that we will never again do one of those so-called

[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:14.660]
remotes all of the shows are going to be from the studio they spend a lot of money to build beautiful

[00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:19.540]
studios here and the acoustics are great and everything works and at least most of the time

[00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:25.520]
and that's that's where we need to be and you know what's important is how many people are listening

[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:30.000]
not to have a couple of hundred people running around making noise waiting for us to throw food at

[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.460]
them you know and but again most of the people were there were real nice on Saturday but it just

[00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:41.020]
doesn't sound good and my final comment I'm a law student and until I entered law school you hear

[00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:47.260]
talk of the constitution you hear talk of rights but you really don't see or realize the importance

[00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:52.120]
of those rights a lot of times until you see how the case law has developed when the government has

[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:58.340]
tried to take away those rights from you yeah and I'll tell you I have come to appreciate the fact

[00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:04.880]
that although defendants let's say may be protected by search and seizure laws those are designed

[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:12.540]
to protect you and me not the defendant and I think that for I think the people or the citizens

[00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:19.940]
in this country should take a course to teach them about the value of free speech how important it

[00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:25.400]
is to for you to be able to give that speech when people disagree with you yeah when it's important

[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:29.800]
it doesn't matter when everyone's in agreement or ever it's going to lapse up what you're saying

[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:33.460]
there are a lot of people missing the whole point on this latest thing with the FCC they think it

[00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:38.220]
all has to do with Howard Jern a stern and so-called shock shocks and doesn't have anything to do

[00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:42.700]
with that it has to do with whether the commissioner any branch of the government can censor and keep

[00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:47.180]
limiting our right to free expression it's got nothing to do with shock shocks well no one should

[00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:54.200]
be surprised that voted for Reagan because it was clear from the outset that his intention was to

[00:55:54.200 --> 00:56:00.180]
quote let's say cleanse the country from Edwin Miest an attorney general to say that the United

[00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:07.800]
States Supreme Court decisions do not carry any precedent or authority to his release on pornography

[00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:15.140]
to the prayer in public school issue to the stance against abortion every one of these are infringing

[00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:21.260]
on a personal right of the public and those who voted for him should not now complain when they

[00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:25.760]
see those rights disappearing one well that's true but the rest of us don't want to lose a meter that's

[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:30.820]
the problem exactly i think that uh... we need to send a clear message to Washington okay election

[00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:37.180]

[01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:42.700]
well i have a little more about the people in restaurants have bad experience about them

[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:47.040]
let people know where good restaurants are to go to and i'm going to get ripped off and yeah

[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:50.560]
you know we do these shows every once in a while we didn't want a few weeks ago and we ask people

[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:54.220]
where the really good restaurants are but i'm going to tell you something it's uh it's like

[01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:59.040]
looking for a needle in the haystack in this town there is more garbage for a square inch in

[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:03.280]
term what's called food in this town than you're going to find anywhere i know i took my wife off

[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:08.080]
to one knee uh fratting out and my son and the mom comes up from the chair and says what kind of

[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:12.960]
back of her stool where we are sitting that i was it you just left the place and i didn't even buy

[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:17.680]
the bag of the food and i just thought that you got to check this place you got a nice one around

[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:21.820]
here oh hey hey hey i know we know we can do to get rid of them though and you know something

[01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:27.100]
even the mice won't eat the food there yeah probably not true we know we know we had a bad

[01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:31.700]
a couple bad experience that restaurant but i'm not uh i tried to find one good enough to go to

[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:36.700]
and yeah if they had more people around who were up in the restaurant but people know where

[01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:40.780]
the food's good and what it serves is good or you get some places where they got to rely

[01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:46.740]
on your washing hands yeah this month at least it's uh try to find us we don't even bother eating

[01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:08.480]
away out in the boondocks somewhere shouldn't be that hard and you drive around and around and around

[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:13.900]
and you see these same prefabricated and all the fast food junk food places and uh

[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:19.240]
boy it's impossible and another thing i'm getting real sick of is unless you're in a mood for

[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:25.900]
Italian or Chinese is there any place else to go i mean i love Italian food and i love Chinese food

[01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:33.960]
but you can't eat it every day we've got seven million Chinese right there you tell me

[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:37.080]

[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:21.440]
congratulations thank you also want to go over tv Smith Park Saturday really i had a very good time

[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:27.640]
while i'm glad you somebody did i was very surprised he was some of the hosts actually look like i know

[01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:29.780]
that's why we're not going out anymore

[01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:35.160]
taffy was much better than i expected taffy yeah taffy's a nice looking woman

[01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:40.580]
taffy was a lot worse than i expected yeah well taffy keep okay well i don't i've just

[01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:46.300]
got them both confused now taffy west she's insisting on doing this tiny timber routine you know

[01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:51.120]
and she's got that frisley hair and that big hook nose you know she can't help herself

[01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:54.960]
and uh Ernie was a little older than i expected to

[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:59.660]
Ernie is real old believe me he he claims to be 51 on the air but i think put another few

[01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:03.420]
years on it like ten or fifteen you're closer to the truth and i noticed he kept bumping his

[01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:07.460]
rocker into the microphone yeah in fact Ernie was talking about the boar war all the Jewish

[01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:12.620]
veterans from the boar war the other day what are you going to be doing another live broadcast never

[01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:19.240]
never again you never again that bad oh the worst the worst oh by the way how much money did you

[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:24.180]
end up picking up for so far that afternoon between three and four hundred it was great well

[01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:28.340]
and you count maybe at 200 people there that's not too bad but we had more than that because we got

[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:33.080]
350 signatures on the petitions all that's good then but you know really when you stop and think of

[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:36.960]
it if it would have been in a different kind of a place where people didn't have to pay to get in

[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:41.840]
and where they knew how to find it we could have five thousand people on Saturday i was really

[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:46.660]
surprised i expected to see much more of a crowd yeah well we don't like to promote things we'd

[01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:52.060]
like to keep in real quiet you know but it was fun and i did have a good time for pines for a day great

[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:56.280]
congratulations on your ratings thanks a lot have a safe trip were you coming back i'll be back in a week

[01:04:56.280 --> 01:05:02.360]
okay well let us know what's going on out there okay take care yourself good day okay seventeen

[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:07.920]
before noon at wion z we have an open line in date six two four oh one nine one now that the book is

[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:11.500]
out i'm going to start talking like Brian Cumble you know i mean why should i go through the effort

[01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:16.660]
of moving my lips you know when you're real smug and complacent you know just sitting kind of mumble

[01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:23.660]
you notice he never moves his lips man he is the laziest the most talk about laid back you know

[01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:27.320]
usually in the morning you don't want somebody screaming at you early in the morning but you'd like

[01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:33.180]
somebody who's a little bit lively not too much but a little bit lively to keep you awake and

[01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:39.640]
Brian is like station breaker today on vc you know he just he just doesn't move and i guess

[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:43.500]
everything in life even so because used to be when he worked for nvc sports and used to do the

[01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:49.880]
pregame show on the baseball games he was always out in a crowd like you're down on the field when a

[01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:55.940]
crowd was making a lot of noise like mike adamley who used to play for the bears same kind of thing

[01:05:55.940 --> 01:06:01.460]
a screamer a real screamer well we're down here on the field joe you know that kind of thing always

[01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:07.660]
screaming and i think a Bryant just kind of left his voice at Yankee stadium and now he just

[01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:11.680]
said there any mumbles any barely moves his lips uh... he's great my any good morning

[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:18.440]
morning now i i listen i uh... i heard you on the uh... zeta this morning really you were the one

[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:23.440]
listening huh well the thing is that i listen to you on occasion i've called you a couple of

[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:28.000]
times my mother got me uh... starting to listen to you but anyway the only thing about this morning

[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.800]
is i resented once you started your show that you had made mention that you are near at the fm

[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:37.860]
and you said that uh... but their listeners don't care because they're all on drugs anyway

[01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:40.500]
i resent that because i do listen to zeta

[01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:47.360]
however i want to know why let's just say most of their own okay that better why would you let the

[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:47.840]
station

[01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:54.520]
subject you to what happened at pumpernick and what happened at cb park well wait a minute you think

[01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:59.000]
that i knew ahead of time that i was going to be like uh... out on a limb do you think that i

[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.540]
expected that i mean when we went to the diplomat mall in hallen veiled

[01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:06.920]
we had a whole bunch of police and we had some off duty police and they had some security they

[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:09.540]
were prepared for some on-rally people to show up

[01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:15.120]
and it was handled pretty well i think i assume that it would be the same the other day because if

[01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:18.840]
there's too stupid to understand that there you know there are few people out there who are too

[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:22.540]
fond of me and i'm sure there are also some people out there who don't like spindle or

[01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:27.040]
so it's in or taffy or catheter somebody you know everybody's got a few nuts out there who'd like

[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:31.620]
to take a shot at him and i would have i would assume that we were going to have some security

[01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:37.440]
well how did the thing with uh... with uh... pumpernick's come about anyway i mean how did you happen to be there

[01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:42.340]
did the station set that up also yeah our sales department set that up

[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:48.940]
oh i see and i have no idea what the purpose of that whole thing was i mean to me that was the most

[01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:53.720]
mysterious thing other than to get my tire slashed i have no idea why i was even there

[01:07:54.560 --> 01:08:00.120]
that's too bad that it's now so i'd you undoing any other remotes because some people do like to see

[01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:04.520]
you and be able to talk to in person yeah well ordinarily i've enjoyed it in the past

[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:10.500]
if it's in the right setting and if you've got a lively group of people who've got something to say

[01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:15.700]
or ask some interesting questions it's a lot of fun but unfortunately the sales you know i guess

[01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:19.920]
now that these new ratings are out hopefully if this doesn't do it nothing ever will but it'll

[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:23.820]
make them realize that we're not talking just to people over the age of a hundred anymore you

[01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:28.440]
know you remember they sent me out to the hallmark i mean that was a disaster it was an

[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:33.840]
unmitigated disaster and the whole concept the only reason i agreed to go there was if we were

[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:38.440]
gonna do something to try to get some younger people out there and get a mixed audience instead

[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:42.680]
of just talking to the people who live there over the age of a hundred and it didn't work out

[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:46.380]
their way that way because there was there was just nothing done to lure anybody else out there

[01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:52.100]
and let's face it on a Wednesday afternoon at noon most most younger people are in school or

[01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:56.780]
they're working or they're doing something that's right well i'll tell you all i wanted to let you

[01:08:56.780 --> 01:09:01.280]
know as i did call back later this morning to tell you that we love you thank you and uh... one

[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:06.760]
thing to the uh... gentlemen uh... not not your last caller but the caller before he sounded like

[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:10.220]
one of the uh... he must have been the brother of the guy that was standing outside of pump

[01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:15.120]
and excreting yeah if you don't like me or ragers don't bother calling

[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:19.880]
amen don't need people like him although i tell you one caller like him every day would be pretty good

[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:25.440]
well yeah he actually does stir things up but he's a jerk okay anyway keep up the good work

[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:25.900]
c later

[01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:31.740]
problem it's before noon at w i n z we have an open line in brown or it's seven six four oh seven

[01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:35.660]

[01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:38.440]
hunk contest for the uh... tract of young ladies and men

[01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:42.640]
because our audience boy generally speaking is pretty ugly you know the host of

[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:46.260]
ruggly so naturally the audience is going to be pretty ugly i mean there were nice people don't

[01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:46.820]
get me wrong

[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:50.320]

[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:53.740]
who were very attractive in fact uh... what was her name

[01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:57.000]

[01:09:57.740 --> 01:10:01.320]
uh... she was only fourteen an earning was trying to attack her right there in a park which was

[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:06.320]
embarrassing but uh... generally speaking man it was a pretty motley looking group

[01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:13.480]
she would take another call from hollywood hello hello yes hello well yes this is the first time i'm

[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:25.380]

[01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:30.240]
oh boy we were there for our rest of the day this Saturday night

[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:36.760]
i had a friend of mine that this weekend with his wife and he said the same thing he said it was a

[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:44.760]
nightmare i'll tell you i never in my life ever ever went to a restaurant that there

[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:52.860]

[01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:56.360]
the left hand was doing yeah and you should have seen what the left hand was doing

[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:01.840]
i wonder the first writers came over and asked me what we would like

[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:07.160]

[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:11.100]
potato well twenty minutes passed by i don't get

those checks don't forget we need money because we want to raise several thousand dollars

[01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:08.160]
for a variety of purposes for so far the most important being to take out some newspaper ads to

[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:13.200]
take out ad not only locally but i'd like to put one in the wash and in post of the new york times

[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:43.160]

on thursday and we'll really go into that book and we'll digest it and spit it out and just do

[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:55.040]
a wild number with it fort lotterdale hello hi niel how you doing today great good i was out there

[01:19:55.040 --> 01:20:00.540]
saturday and i did pick up a petition yeah and i were gonna get that thing back to you filled up

[01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:07.180]
right but uh anyway i just some comments on saturday uh i i was starving to death on the way

[01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:12.840]
over there and uh stopped by that restaurant and uh locked in there and it smelled so bad like

[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:18.740]
like they like they were frying b o or something yeah well that was on the menu fried b oden to see

[01:20:18.740 --> 01:20:24.700]
that uh we didn't see it together had an early bird on that but we didn't eat there but uh i

[01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:31.840]
say one thing uh you know we didn't eat there and now it was just too disgusting but uh anyway

[01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:38.700]
just some comments on saturday uh we were surprised that early looked more alive than he actually sounds

[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:45.780]
and that that was that was one of the big east uh well i think god gave her any of brain

[01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:52.060]
transplant last saturday i think he did something for him yeah well you know definitely uh it's

[01:20:52.060 --> 01:20:59.180]
better to see him than uh to hear him sometimes anyway we're surprised taffy was uh we expected her

[01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:04.900]
to be very uh overweight and uh are you serious yeah boy taffy i bet you doesn't weigh any pounds

[01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:11.600]
yeah well she was uh now she was a lot better looking than she sounds yeah that seems to be the general

[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:21.980]
consensus and of course uh you know her looks aren't much either so what is that tell you about the

[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:27.320]
cathode was she eating a lot i was trying to not look at her because she embarrassed me so badly

[01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:32.680]
in the first part of the show that i just kept trying to ignore her yeah well we were trying to

[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:39.660]
ignore all stuff but we kept seeing her hand go from the uh trade to her mouth was constant well

[01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:46.120]
she's uh can't he's always upset if she doesn't have something in her mouth anyway uh you mentioned

[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:50.200]
you know you noticed by the way we had a few volunteers in the crowd when i mentioned that on saturday

[01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:54.420]
oh yeah some of those young guys boy they were just a good thing we had the barricades there

[01:21:54.420 --> 01:22:00.800]
i know they were ready they were ready to climb over the ropes yeah and uh also uh you mentioned

[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:04.000]
that there's no good place to get a stake have you ever been to root crisis

[01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:10.660]
no you mean a federal highway yeah it's really excellent really see i'm at this point i'm ready to

[01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:15.200]
travel high and far and i'm not i'm not trying to be a malcontent or to try to be you know mr.

[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:21.760]
sour grapes but they're just are so many bad places and generally when you go to a like when i

[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:26.920]
go on vacation and go someplace for the first time like when i went to Hawaii i never got a bad

[01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:31.300]
meal no matter where i went i got a good meal and i what did i know you know i just walking off the

[01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:36.580]
street in a place it looks pretty good and they were good yeah but uh the whole thing about this

[01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:44.120]
place is it's expensive i mean it probably uh it's probably like a stake is about 20 bucks or

[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:50.620]
22 dollars but it's the best stake i've had in Florida and uh and and i think actually i even

[01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:55.400]
think it's better than birds but it doesn't have that type of a menu where you can you know pick

[01:22:55.400 --> 01:23:00.220]
the size and so forth yeah but it is really good well i've never been i've never been in the size

[01:23:00.220 --> 01:23:05.700]
you know not interested in that okay Neil well i just wanted to let you know there is one good

[01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:11.440]
place for stake and that's it okay appreciate it right okay Ruth chris that's on federal highway

[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:16.120]
that's up there by that um moi lee the chinese restaurant up there that's pretty good too

[01:23:16.820 --> 01:23:20.400]
1216 now listen don't get panicky we're not going to do another restaurant show because last time

[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:24.160]
we did that a few weeks ago a lot of the young suits out there got all bent out of shape about that

[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:27.680]
probably because they tried a couple of the restaurants that some of the people in the audience

[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:31.800]
recommended i wish you could have seen this guy it was a nice guy i don't want to put him down

[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:37.060]
but here i get to the park on saturday i've just had all my tires slashed i've been in the middle of

[01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:41.120]
this bizarre experience at pumper snickers and i have no idea what the hell it was all about

[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:45.340]
and i get to the park and here's this guy and he's just all over me about duffs

[01:23:46.220 --> 01:23:50.380]
you know why would anybody want to spend more than two seconds talking about duffs

[01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:56.920]
and he kept sloshing his teeth around in that glass it was disgusting okay next caller is on a mobile

[01:23:56.920 --> 01:24:04.900]
phone hello yeah you're doing them okay i don't know if that's good or bad but i am anyway

[01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:09.800]
getting back to the restaurant if you want a real good stake uh the pond is i find excellent

[01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:16.820]
the palms that's the palm the palm it's uh on day off of the village it's uh it's from new york it's

[01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:21.440]
actually a new york restaurant it's down here yeah um don't let her any hear about that

[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:25.600]
well what can i tell you but that is i mean a flight at stake down they flight a lot to the

[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:30.860]
town i need sex with roofed Chris they have good state but they have so inconsistent and

[01:24:30.860 --> 01:24:35.800]
ridiculous i was there once they picked up over a three hundred dollar tier because the service

[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:42.060]
really really well what is their problem i don't know i mean i i must have been in here about ten times

[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:47.280]
uh added the ten times the food's been good i'm not going to say what their service is at

[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:52.020]
trotious yeah i mean really at trotious and back kind of money in other words it's a nice place to

[01:24:52.020 --> 01:24:55.580]
visit but you wouldn't want to eat there that's right if you want a good state come tell on you

[01:24:55.580 --> 01:24:59.980]
i mean mom he's to me that nobody mentions the palm down here let's see it so far for me i mean

[01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:03.880]
i don't live anywhere near there i live up in no man's land at least right now in a few days i'm

[01:25:03.940 --> 01:25:08.360]
going to move again i think i'm going to start moving every week i live in plantations oh really

[01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:12.940]
yeah and it's worth the trip well are you familiar with all these new developments like

[01:25:12.940 --> 01:25:16.820]
alos prados and all these others where you can't get in if you make over a certain amount of money

[01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:22.380]
because they're financed by bond money right uh they're like dozens all the new places in

[01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:26.900]
plantation if you make more than forty eight grand a year they can't rent to you there's not

[01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:31.140]
nothing that you are now yeah it's unbelievable i mean i never heard a such

[01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:34.040]
discriminate i've heard of people who can't afford to live in a place because they don't make

[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:38.780]
enough money but whoever heard of being turned away because you make too much money i can't believe

[01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:43.460]
it's a plantation city council i've got yeah oh yeah all of them about 90% of the new developments

[01:25:43.460 --> 01:25:48.540]
in plantation are like uh middle class sued places where you can't make more than a certain

[01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:52.320]
amount of year they can't rent to you what you're telling you is fine to move out that huh

[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:57.880]
what you're telling me is this time to move out well what can i say i got a place i found a new one

[01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:01.780]
okay good thanks a lot the way to write fine i hope my landlord's listening to that i don't even

[01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:05.840]
know if he's uh maybe he's left town see that just like this guy from pumper nicks can you believe

[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:14.060]
we are leaving the park on saturday at two o'clock he comes by us in christianic the salesman rolls down

[01:26:14.060 --> 01:26:19.500]
a window and says we're on our way back to pumper nicks will meet you at your restaurant okay he never

[01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:27.080]
comes back he's like charlie on the mta he never returned you know like he got on the metro rail

[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:31.080]
something and he can't get off like it's on a he's on a revolving roller coaster and he can't get

[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:38.100]
off i'll show you how hyped up i am today i've already crossed out the second break on my law we

[01:26:38.100 --> 01:26:41.820]
haven't even done the first one yet and i've already crossed out well that's what happens when

[01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:46.840]
the ratings come out you know you get these as a wild numbers and again uh thanks to everybody out

[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:51.120]
there for supporting a free speech and supporting this show and i go through all that corny stuff

[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:56.920]
every time what can i say this is a good show you know i can't i can't help it it just in some days

[01:26:56.920 --> 01:27:01.120]
it's better than other days some days like today it's boring but we can't do exciting shows every day

[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:05.740]
i want to thank especially i feel like one of those people up there at the emis or the oscars

[01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:10.820]
or the golden global awards of those stupid things especially i want to thank jean stevens because i

[01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:16.220]
know you know a halendale bit was good and sunny rosinburg and intendola they helped a lot but

[01:27:16.220 --> 01:27:23.020]
jeano without you and post-time USA we could have never done it trust me okay 20 minutes after

[01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:27.800]
12 at w-on-z that'll make him have indigestion for the rest of the month we'll come back right after

[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:33.120]
this the 12 23 at w-on-z you know i just look at these numbers and i realize it's probably an

[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:36.760]
anything right we don't want to get to win with these ratings because the audience doesn't care right

[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:43.040]
they do al's mother cares you know the cheat threatened the quit if they had me at pump

[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:49.620]
her next the other day she's a waitress there and she threatened the quit shame on you

[01:27:50.060 --> 01:27:59.300]
Mrs. cue anyway i'm looking at the w-snews numbers boy followers in a lot of trouble you know

[01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:05.960]
something they did pretty well in the morning they did mediocre at night whether down of a four

[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:10.640]
nine at night but wouldn't you think that the big drop would have been in the afternoon where

[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:15.860]
the eight million dollar man where we're a cane left they had a three four that's about what he

[01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:22.400]
gets all the time right the big drop over there was from 10 to three that's Alison Lee

[01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:30.740]
major catastrophe there in the midday day part but the Craig i guess kept things up there the

[01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:34.260]
afternoon that's because the crowd that likes to have the positive in the afternoon they turn

[01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:37.540]
in there from three to seven because they want to hear only positive they don't like all his

[01:28:37.540 --> 01:28:42.220]
knocking of our hosts they know what it's like to go by royal castle and not have 25 cents of

[01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:47.420]
pocket friends all friends you don't know what i mean when i tell you this i don't know what i

[01:28:47.420 --> 01:28:54.120]
mean because i don't know much of anything i think what we need to say bill will banks

[01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:58.340]
Janet Reno and Ellis Rubin on together wouldn't that be hell of a show you notice that's the new

[01:28:58.340 --> 01:29:03.680]

taken by those birds in the background that was great i have five of them i called um i'm a

[01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:35.600]
hundred great and we're still living and breathing out here there are some of us who are under a hundred

[01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:44.020]
on my amy beach i love those birds you know something to me one of the most peaceful things is to go

[01:31:44.020 --> 01:31:48.880]
out like i was out in the side lawn here at the station on uh friday i think i went out for a

[01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:54.140]
couple of minutes and the birds were chirping out there and it was real quiet wouldn't you just

[01:31:54.140 --> 01:31:58.800]
like to get away and just sit and listen to that for about an hour someday just just to uh come back

[01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:05.860]
down to earth yeah i would listen i wanted to make a comment about this uh thing about the fcc

[01:32:05.860 --> 01:32:13.080]
yeah they're so worried about talk show hosts and people expressing opinions that happen to be a

[01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:19.140]
little too close to the truth and they're not worried i was watching 60 minutes last night and they

[01:32:19.140 --> 01:32:25.720]
have this this guy who is sentenced to two life sentences who they pulled after eight years the

[01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:34.600]
Austin choker the old man oh yeah they're not more women yeah okay they're so uh concerned about

[01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:40.620]
radio they're not looking they're looking to protect uh criminal rights you know and there's so far

[01:32:40.620 --> 01:32:46.040]
off base yeah this man went out and choked two more women well i think what they're hoping to do is

[01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:49.840]
that he'll run into the guy that they lit out in california that they tried to send to florida

[01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:55.020]
and that he'll cut his arms off you know i mean that it's just incredible it's mind-boggling

[01:32:55.020 --> 01:33:01.220]
they're just so misdirected yeah and one other thing i wanted to say uh like i said we've

[01:33:01.220 --> 01:33:06.760]
listened to your show for quite a while and it seems like the people like that man who got his

[01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:12.740]
sterile on the phone earlier ummm that your listeners seem to fall into three categories the ones

[01:33:12.740 --> 01:33:19.940]
that you speak the truth about get real upset then you have the ones that call you up and patronize

[01:33:20.740 --> 01:33:26.380]
and they're the ones who they get upset too but they choose not to you know rent and rave on

[01:33:26.380 --> 01:33:31.700]
on the air yeah they rent and rave off here right and and then they call you and say oh me how i

[01:33:31.700 --> 01:33:37.700]
think that's so wonderful and then you have the middle of the road people that listen in a

[01:33:37.700 --> 01:33:44.200]
astonishment like my friend and i and uh it's just unbelievable we were thinking of going out there

[01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:51.460]
to see your show and now i'm glad we didn't it's a shame that you can't do remote shows you know

[01:33:51.460 --> 01:33:59.960]
here's a talk show host that's willing to go out and past tense well what's willing to go out and do

[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:08.000]
shows and throw in uh uh comical music and be a little different and it's a shame now you can't

[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:13.140]
do it because people have to act like animals yeah it's just a shame well what can i tell you

[01:34:13.140 --> 01:34:19.380]
and then they complain because so many of the hosts are boring or they go to sleep listening to them

[01:34:19.380 --> 01:34:25.200]
they get somebody who who is a little lively and they spoil it well they don't want too much life

[01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:28.820]
child they just want enough life to serve them a corn beach sandwich in that set

[01:34:28.820 --> 01:34:34.820]
i guess so with mayonnaise okay well listen take care of yourself and take care of those birds

[01:34:34.820 --> 01:34:38.800]
i will i love them yeah listen anytime you call i'm gonna know who it is

[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:43.700]
i'll give myself away by the birds okay see you later okay bye bye

[01:34:44.340 --> 01:34:47.720]
let you luke-kron would go nuts in her house if he saw the bird seed huh

[01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:54.760]
have her arrested those are marijuana seeds i know what i can tell it's his hearts mountain on the package

[01:34:56.440 --> 01:35:00.540]
maybe we could redo the bird seed episode on here i guess that takes people back a long time

[01:35:00.540 --> 01:35:03.660]
see i have to get used to the fact that there are a whole lot of new people listening to this show

[01:35:03.660 --> 01:35:08.340]
thank goodness and they don't know about any of that old good stuff from the days gone by like my

[01:35:08.340 --> 01:35:13.060]
bird seed episode where people sent me in bird seed and the general manager thought it was a pot seeds

[01:35:15.020 --> 01:35:19.160]
and that was that was bizarre and it turned out he didn't have a pot to hiss in

[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:26.200]
where we go next to sunrise hello oh Neil how you doing i'm fine i'm one of those under 100 people

[01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:33.140]
that are on my neoholic good uh at uh my fingers start to twitch if i don't hear your voice

[01:35:33.140 --> 01:35:38.440]
between ten and two and that you know it could be a problem kind of like the water cronize syndrome huh

[01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:43.180]
right uh you know one one of the bad things about listening waiting on the phone as you can't turn down

[01:35:43.180 --> 01:35:49.280]
your uh some of your commercials that uh are annoying some of our commercials are annoying

[01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:54.000]
yeah well that's true now that you mentioned it that they i don't know who does that uh

[01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:02.160]
the yep uh uh seven bell yeah i don't know uh but uh he must uh stutter thinking

[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:12.240]
because the uh they have to ask the same question three times yeah i don't know what the point

[01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:15.760]
it well that's because they they figure the audience in south florida when they put the spots on

[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:19.840]
another parts of the country they only ask it once but they figure that people here are brain

[01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:24.360]
dead so they have to keep repeating it over and over again they've got a point you know well i

[01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:31.520]
it it uh when i listen i i always uh you know uh we're not here commercials in tv to it i like

[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:35.640]
just talk back to the you know you know you you know you dope what's the matter you know that

[01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:40.040]
i guess people think i'm crazy too uh you know and that the uh steering wheel or whatever

[01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:45.760]
yeah yeah i yell at my steering wheel all the time oh i was uh boy this is

[01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:51.100]
when they ask uh uh how long you think uh how can keep saying now that he's the most

[01:36:51.100 --> 01:36:55.260]
listen to uh oh yeah that's interesting i think everybody ought to uh let's send out the

[01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:59.840]
wynz alert i think that since the numbers are out i haven't read in my hand as a matter of fact

[01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:06.480]
that tomorrow morning at nine if w snooze has the audacity to play that ridiculous cart about uh

[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:11.380]
rantelting south florida's most listen to talk show host that people are to immediately get on the

[01:37:11.380 --> 01:37:16.480]
phone and let them really have it let's have a little little truth in promos and truth and show

[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:23.440]
introsley didn't they uh didn't you beat him last reading yes well how could he keep saying well

[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:28.500]
because uh leaf out in the truth are strangers i mean you know they have never met but this time it's

[01:37:28.500 --> 01:37:34.980]
so it's so glaring i mean it's not even in the same ballpark well uh i don't know if they say

[01:37:34.980 --> 01:37:40.320]
it tomorrow again somebody ought to really let him have what for i also wondering if you heard any

[01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:46.820]
uh uh anything back from the uh uh people you sent the uh there's so far information out

[01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:54.100]
of other cities and uh not not yet expect you if you have gotten any uh response at all i mean uh

[01:37:54.100 --> 01:37:58.000]
well locally we have but uh you know it's a little too soon i hope this week we're going to start

[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:01.680]
hearing from around the rest of the country okay Neil we just we just started sending him out

[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:06.320]
last week okay thanks a lot okay speaking of rest of the market look at this Keith Allen of love

[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:11.660]
94 is calling because he knows Glenn Hills not here Keith hi Neil how you doing good i got your

[01:38:11.660 --> 01:38:17.960]
invitation to your uh may 16th bash right i can't make it because i'm going to be an LA for a wedding

[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:22.720]
but i'll be there in spirit and i've got your uh your petition i'll be sending it around great

[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:28.160]
i um was listening to the fellow from the fcc and i thought it was one of the more frightening

[01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:33.160]
things i've heard on the radio in a long long time especially the part where he was talking about

[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:39.120]
not only are they worried about the actual content but the inferences that the audience may pick up

[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:45.020]
right and the audience may be thinking a certain way and they can ascertain the fcc figures they

[01:38:45.020 --> 01:38:49.420]
can ascertain what the audience may be thinking i think we're in real dangerous ground when we have

[01:38:49.420 --> 01:38:55.300]
federal organizations like that they're going around spouting nonsense like that um it's like if

[01:38:55.300 --> 01:39:01.200]
you read the grapes of wrath by john Steinbeck yeah and you might read it and say well that's a nice

[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:07.540]
book about the uh the okis fleeing the uh dust bowl of the 20s and 30s and another person may read

[01:39:07.540 --> 01:39:12.480]
it and say no that's not about that it's about that but it's actually about uh the resiliency of

[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:18.320]
the human spirit against insurmountable odds now which is it about it's up to the individual right

[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:23.880]
right and nowhere does john Steinbeck write this book is about this that the other through his

[01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:29.420]
creativity he expresses an idea or a feeling that comes through without him directly saying it

[01:39:29.420 --> 01:39:34.540]
and if they're going to start messing with that uh they're they're tampering with something that i

[01:39:34.540 --> 01:39:38.840]
think separates us from the lower life forms on this planet well you got to understand that most

[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:44.080]
of the lower life forms of the planet are in government and especially at the fcc once you get

[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:48.880]
up to washington that's you know about as low as you can go why is that well i don't know i think

[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:56.320]
they just gravitate toward it i don't know i don't understand i just i thought concerts article was

[01:39:56.320 --> 01:40:00.820]
uh very good sensational he's a working at the hellendale digest now by the way

[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:04.940]

[01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:13.020]
now Glenn's okay say hello to him for me are you serious yes why no i'm only kidding i'm just

[01:40:13.020 --> 01:40:16.880]
baiting you a little bit here i don't know i mean uh you guys work together for a long time didn't you

[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:21.480]
i've known Glenn hill since 1973 well that's a long time that's long enough to have a lot of

[01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:25.640]
disagreements that's that's true we have more than our share okay well listen i'll give him your best

[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:31.820]

[01:40:42.020 --> 01:40:47.160]
about this first amendment right because i just started listening to you about a month ago and i've

[01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:52.180]
just got i don't know that much about the constitutional being on that so when i got some encyclopedias

[01:40:52.180 --> 01:40:56.540]
and reading through it i found the part on the fcc commission and their federal government yeah

[01:40:56.540 --> 01:41:00.960]
so i called them up down to my me office now it's about the one line that reads the commission also

[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:06.560]
regulates radio and television stations without censorship authority and he's danced around it

[01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:11.840]
saying this and he got me a little upset so i called him uh one of your favorites the subhuman

[01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:23.820]
douchebag and he goes oh you're with that Roger that's great that's really funny automatically in his

[01:49:45.980 --> 01:49:51.100]
in four lotterdale who's had a long wait hello hello hi how you doing oh not too bad Neil

[01:49:51.100 --> 01:49:55.460]
now i thought i had to find you something happened the other evening that uh it's got a bearing on

[01:49:55.460 --> 01:50:01.260]
this fcc uh nonsense yes sir and they're excuse i was looking after a couple of kids seven years old

[01:50:01.260 --> 01:50:06.060]
and eight years old and they brought up the subject to bad language and that sort of think

[01:50:06.060 --> 01:50:11.320]
probably because of the media coverage it's received and turns out both of them knew all the seven

[01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:19.140]
words and then some yeah and uh then i thought well let's let's see uh let's see what the kids

[01:50:19.140 --> 01:50:24.720]
are today uh whether they use the words a lot i know i did when i was a youngster and i said i

[01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:29.320]
asked them how do you use them a lot of school and he held his kids it uh oh yeah all the time

[01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:34.460]
and then the seven-year-old said something i made me think he said that yeah of course we've got to

[01:50:34.460 --> 01:50:41.460]
walk out language in front of adults that's right and i don't want to corrupt the morals of their

[01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:46.500]
parents as soon as the kid walks in all the adults is so right you know we're going to cut out

[01:50:46.500 --> 01:50:50.500]
the language and the kids are using the same language and as soon as the parents were

[01:50:50.500 --> 01:50:54.600]
or an adult walks in they've got to stop the language as well right i think it's about time they

[01:50:54.600 --> 01:51:01.920]
all got together and swore at each other no hey um well Glenn's there Glenn who

[01:51:02.580 --> 01:51:07.420]
isn't Glenn that Glenn Miller he just came in he heard the k-a-t call it is mentioned yes

[01:51:07.420 --> 01:51:15.120]
yes Glenn he's making guttural noises in the background again yeah um he figures the book is

[01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:18.920]

[01:57:58.740 --> 01:58:05.660]
often now the stuff you took at uh pumpernix never again because if you never again and you

[01:58:05.660 --> 01:58:11.960]
notice it's always these old men these pathetic old men with the big you know two in spaces between

[01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:15.920]
their teeth and the red you know red in the face like they're going to have a stroke they're

[01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:20.120]
about a half a dozen of them out there they just haunt me everywhere so the ones that migrate from

[01:58:20.120 --> 01:58:28.020]
the north no yes it was awful i mean i was like from the northeast i was thinking you know uh i

[01:58:28.020 --> 01:58:32.640]
sort of envy talk show host because i say well you know they make all this money for doing nothing

[01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:38.640]
and oh yeah oh my god if you take that uh uh very often it's not worth no matter how much you make

[01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:42.600]
i mean that guy was he was beyond apple place i really was concerned that he was going to have a

[01:58:42.600 --> 01:58:47.560]
heart attack he was just screaming and yelling and then he kept chewing on that free donation the

[01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:52.980]
guy was just nuts and yeah the crappy thing is the hypocrisy is that these are the people that

[01:58:52.980 --> 01:58:58.240]
want to ban seven dirty words yeah he was he was letting some loose to nobody ever heard before

[01:58:58.240 --> 01:59:03.920]
i i i sort of almost had to throw my kids back in the car when i heard that yeah turn on the radio

[01:59:03.920 --> 01:59:11.660]
listen to something clean but uh you know i i like to acknowledge you for you know putting yourself

[01:59:11.660 --> 01:59:19.000]
out there and uh doing what you do uh i enjoyed the park scene you know at least i got a little

[01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:25.880]
sun and a lot of us stay indoors because uh everything is dead from the brains down in this place

[01:59:25.880 --> 01:59:31.480]
yeah you said it from the brains to the toes so when we find something that'll bring us out there

[01:59:31.480 --> 01:59:36.620]
i usually appreciate it no matter what it is because it at least does get you out there

[01:59:37.160 --> 01:59:40.900]
well that's true now the crowd was good it was just that it was chaotic and nobody could hear

[01:59:40.900 --> 01:59:46.940]
anything and everybody was uh i don't know i just was lost i think any chance that i had to do

[01:59:46.940 --> 01:59:52.120]
anything useful out there died when my tires got flattened you know at that point it was like the

[01:59:52.120 --> 01:59:57.660]
whole rest of the day for me was going to be a disaster and it was well he probably whoever did

[01:59:57.660 --> 02:00:02.260]

[02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:38.060]
so bad and you know here i've been trying to watch my weight a little bit and i've been slipping

[02:08:38.060 --> 02:08:42.760]
behind a little but so i'm not trying to go out and eat three gigantic meals a day but on those

[02:08:42.760 --> 02:08:47.040]
occasions when you do want to go for example on the weekend you'd like to have at least something

[02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:52.220]
really good well the thing is is that i can find one restaurant in each category yeah i feel

[02:08:52.220 --> 02:08:56.040]
is okay to go to but there's not like a whole lot of restaurant and when you live in west

[02:08:56.040 --> 02:09:01.260]
broward but i'm going to tell you it is really grim i mean it is desperate you have to make the

[02:09:01.260 --> 02:09:06.200]
only restaurant i know he actually don't know anything up there no there is nothing i mean

[02:09:06.200 --> 02:09:09.960]
bokeh is a good restaurant see people in the audience keep calling and making them up to try to

[02:09:09.960 --> 02:09:16.220]
make me feel better they make up names except for the pizza place uh brick oven pizza brick ovens

[02:09:16.220 --> 02:09:21.680]
but that's not anywhere near me and i how much pizza can you eat that's what my point was this

[02:09:21.680 --> 02:09:26.140]
morning if you don't want Chinese and you don't want to Italian you might as well forget it

[02:09:26.140 --> 02:09:30.160]
right but basically that's true yeah even the Chinese down here isn't so good

[02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:34.540]
well some of it i've only found one or two that's anything you know worth eating at all

[02:09:35.660 --> 02:09:38.620]
well i don't want to get into your personal life here but listen have a great day

[02:09:38.620 --> 02:09:44.520]
and take care of yourself what was he talking about sex with the Chinese or something that was

[02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:51.340]
strange boy Mao would have been upset about that huh one 19 Chinese by the way i've got some

[02:09:51.340 --> 02:09:55.160]
real hangups about that even the ones who've been here for a long time you know that

[02:09:56.140 --> 02:10:03.160]
because their culture is so um hmm they're just locked into these certain in fact it used to be

[02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:08.680]
before they started uh finding them for making more than one baby it used to be that they spent all

[02:10:08.860 --> 02:10:16.200]
their time eating rice and making babies that's all that they did and you should have seen where

[02:10:16.200 --> 02:10:22.000]
they were eating the rice from you know where that expression rice patty came from uh i wonder if

[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:28.580]

hello this is Michael Jackson urgent you to help stop the spread of social disease don't risk your

[02:11:37.680 --> 02:11:43.780]
life by having a romantic encounter with an unfamiliar queen i urge you to do like i do go at alone

[02:11:43.780 --> 02:11:50.300]
but make sure you wear protection that's why i recommend the Michael Jackson glove worn on either hand

[02:11:50.300 --> 02:11:54.780]
the Michael Jackson glove adds the security and peace of mind that i need to do it myself

[02:11:54.780 --> 02:12:04.820]
so remember before you put it on and the Michael Jackson glove proving once again that a bird in

[02:12:04.820 --> 02:12:09.500]
the hand is better than one in the bush a battle in sequence models for extra stimulation i hear

[02:12:09.500 --> 02:12:15.200]
that uh Joe's working on new ones called the Michael Jackson tongue it's uh 25 past one at

w.i.n.c. you're not gonna leave some of the mail Neil i agree with you 100% and i would like for you

[02:12:20.280 --> 02:12:26.420]
to send me a petition by the way i'm 14 years old and i have heard and have used those seven words

[02:12:28.860 --> 02:12:36.360]
frequently the couple of stains on the paper bottle also wait till you hear this their darker

[02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:43.760]
color stains on this paper mr. Rogers while i've never wasted my time listening to you now i want

[02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:50.940]
you to try to absorb the whole concept here okay this rotten filthy old bag this so b you know

[02:12:50.940 --> 02:12:57.200]
what that is yes so sorry old bag right while i've never wasted my time listening to you i was

[02:12:58.240 --> 02:13:03.800]
told if you don't like what your listeners say you hang up well you can't do that to me

[02:13:04.560 --> 02:13:09.720]
if you're afraid or too guilty to read on i'll never know and i couldn't care less

[02:13:14.620 --> 02:13:20.220]
it's odd you like to dish out what you want anything for shock value but don't like to listen now

[02:13:20.220 --> 02:13:24.280]
this again she's never listened to the show she wouldn't waste the time i suggest if you can't

[02:13:24.280 --> 02:13:29.460]
stand the heat get out of the kitchen your bosses must be hard up to keep a fat slob bastard like

[02:13:29.460 --> 02:13:35.040]
you on their payroll you are a disgrace to humanity if i wouldn't do well if i couldn't do a better

[02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:40.520]
job i'd resign but then i have character and i'm a real journalist and you can tell that by the

[02:13:40.520 --> 02:13:45.780]
language like the fat slob bastard is very good i feel sorry for the persons who tune you in but

[02:13:45.780 --> 02:13:53.880]
then all our morons are not on radio talk programs i'll something i'll wager you don't have the

[02:13:53.880 --> 02:14:00.420]
guts to show this to the management cowards usually don't have guts to face the truth i shant oh

[02:14:00.420 --> 02:14:06.440]
that may oh i shant this must be a real this must be from motafi huh oh i bet she went to smith

[02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:13.160]
college is still green oh she was wonderful at smith college i used to roam with the stale

[02:14:13.160 --> 02:14:18.860]
and in our spare time we used to inspect each other's private parts oh it was wonderful

[02:14:19.560 --> 02:14:25.320]
and in fact we had a lot of spare time so a stella and i grew quite close over the years at smith

[02:14:25.320 --> 02:14:32.260]
college and i guess some of her genius robbed off on me just a matter of speech friends of course

[02:14:33.200 --> 02:14:38.480]
anyway she goes on to say i shant include my address because just in case you'd have the good

[02:14:38.480 --> 02:14:45.320]
manners which i doubt to answer me i really would not care to hear from you a stale green p s

[02:14:46.020 --> 02:14:52.200]
as i read this i can just hear you say i'd like to get my hands on her such nerve

[02:14:53.660 --> 02:14:56.580]
but you are just the type to take a swipe

[02:14:56.580 --> 02:15:04.840]
i was talking to one of these psychologists sing one of the psychologists at the university and

[02:15:04.840 --> 02:15:10.220]
you say you must not have been used to anything in your youth and now that you

[02:15:11.660 --> 02:15:18.200]
do what you do it makes you feel important i feel the same way as the letter goes on it becomes

[02:15:18.200 --> 02:15:26.200]
more illiterate from a stale grain in the audience while a stale we know you're listening right

[02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:31.000]
now and even though taffy can't be there with you to inspect your private parts and give you certain

[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:35.220]
types of stimulation i'm sure that getting your name on the radio is giving you the biggest

[02:15:35.220 --> 02:15:40.360]
thrill that you've had in years probably done more good for you than a good coffee animal would do

[02:15:41.100 --> 02:15:46.280]
you miserable pathetic old bag isn't that great i mean the idea that somebody would take time

[02:15:46.280 --> 02:15:50.120]
to write a letter like that who has never even listened right and we're supposed to believe that

[02:15:51.740 --> 02:15:59.620]
she's a bigger liar than Lee Fowler south my m e hello nil yes beautiful program today you were

[02:15:59.620 --> 02:16:04.560]
right about Saturday ahead to turn radio off it was so bad tragic i got a couple of

[02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:10.740]
embarrassing i got a couple of acronyms for you it's too late for one i agree with you're so far

[02:16:10.740 --> 02:16:16.240]
100 percent but this thought came to me so i thought i passed it on instead of save our first

[02:16:16.240 --> 02:16:23.440]
amendment rights grant our first amendment rights to talk you got that

[02:16:26.100 --> 02:16:35.860]
geo you know go f a yeah what right go far yeah to talk with two t's right okay then

[02:16:35.860 --> 02:16:40.820]
other one the federal community that's not too bad federal communications commission and they're

[02:16:40.820 --> 02:16:45.120]
not really in charge of communications they're destroying it so i would call them the federal

[02:16:46.600 --> 02:16:51.460]
uncommunications commission yeah and you know if you pronounce that one what it comes out yeah very

[02:16:51.460 --> 02:16:55.260]
good sir i got you all the way in fact i wanted to have a bumper sticker that said um

[02:16:55.800 --> 02:16:58.340]
do i dare spell it on here no

[02:17:00.180 --> 02:17:03.720]
or look at him and he just all of a sudden it's like 130 already we're almost

[02:17:03.720 --> 02:17:08.400]
to finished and he's getting cows getting real nervous but why can't i spell it it wasn't going

[02:17:08.400 --> 02:17:13.180]
to be uh it had no k in it well wait a minute i'll tell you what i'll type it out and we'll see

[02:17:13.180 --> 02:17:21.880]
if you think i can spell it okay here it is can i spell that no that would be a good bumper

[02:17:21.880 --> 02:17:26.780]
sticker that wouldn't i mean with periods after each letter not with the okay okay that's

[02:17:26.780 --> 02:17:32.880]
the end of the party Kyle said that's it okay uh my me lakes hello hello Neil yes sir how are you

[02:17:32.880 --> 02:17:39.020]
okay i had an acronym too was so far so bad but i can't say it over the area you can think of

[02:17:39.020 --> 02:17:45.820]
what's so bad so far but listen i'm over here with 45 year petitions right and i took one of them

[02:17:45.820 --> 02:17:52.560]
to the peaceau convention at the front and blue on Saturday night they had 4000 english teachers

[02:17:52.560 --> 02:17:59.340]
the seasaw convention peaceau means teachers the teachers of speakers of other languages oh yes

[02:17:59.340 --> 02:18:05.080]
i remember that from Smith college yes they had four thousand english teachers are i we we got

[02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:10.400]
a slate of the petitions thought out wonderful i sent him to you but here's the crux of the thing

[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:18.260]
there were a great many of them who would not sign why not because there there is many right

[02:18:18.260 --> 02:18:23.380]
wingers in the teaching profession is there are anywhere else oh sure and when you stop to think

[02:18:23.380 --> 02:18:29.800]
Neil that we have people who teach the language but will not sign a first amendment petition

[02:18:29.800 --> 02:18:36.180]
that's where we're going you bet this country and listen why i go off a couple of questions this came

[02:18:36.180 --> 02:18:42.820]
up and i'd like to ask you several people asked if it is not true in order for the petitions to be

[02:18:42.820 --> 02:18:48.320]
valid that they had to write their full address no no this is not a legal binding petition that would

[02:18:48.320 --> 02:18:53.540]
only be if we're a petition uh to for example if we're a petition to put something on a ballot

[02:18:53.540 --> 02:18:58.520]
but that's not the kind of petition we're doing this is just a volume petition or sufficient to put

[02:18:58.520 --> 02:19:04.080]
on the city of right where they reside you bet okay and my last thought i'd like to ask that

[02:19:04.080 --> 02:19:11.920]
i've i it has been my contention for years that the existence the very existence of the FCC on

[02:19:11.920 --> 02:19:19.080]
the face of it is unconstitutional because the first amendment says congress shall make no law

[02:19:19.080 --> 02:19:27.220]
right a bridging freedom of speech the FCC is instituted by congress therefore how can that agency

[02:19:27.220 --> 02:19:34.520]
have any authority to pull this sort of stunt and why hasn't somebody in your business before now

[02:19:34.520 --> 02:19:41.380]
brought a test case on the legitimacy of the FCC as an agency all the way to the Supreme Court

[02:19:41.380 --> 02:19:46.020]
to see if that thing couldn't be completely knocked out of the government well the reason they

[02:19:46.020 --> 02:19:50.900]
haven't done it is because nobody wants to lose their license but i understand what you're saying

[02:19:50.900 --> 02:19:55.520]
i agree with you i don't think you know in terms of this the FCC should be a bookkeeping agency

[02:19:55.520 --> 02:19:59.960]
and they should monitor technical things and they should uh... you know monitor sales of radio stations

[02:20:00.400 --> 02:20:04.620]
and to make sure that responsible people are buying them which of course is a joke when's that going to start

[02:20:04.620 --> 02:20:08.940]
and that should be it that's as much authority as they should have they should absolutely no authority

[02:20:08.940 --> 02:20:14.420]
over content or language whatsoever i know i've heard the rationale the rationale is that the public

[02:20:14.420 --> 02:20:19.080]
airways are limited and therefore they're out that you know that's the biggest excuse i know that

[02:20:19.080 --> 02:20:23.580]
that's the big outlook look the marketplace limits the number you know this jerk that called me

[02:20:23.580 --> 02:20:27.680]
it last week and called taffy with the same phone call about what anybody can start a newspaper

[02:20:28.800 --> 02:20:34.540]
the economics of each community and of the country automatically limit the number of newspapers

[02:20:34.540 --> 02:20:39.660]
that can financially exist so the idea that you know we can have fifty daily newspapers in the city of

[02:20:39.660 --> 02:20:44.200]
Miami is ludicrous so there is there's certainly much more from monopoly when it comes to the print

[02:20:44.200 --> 02:20:49.620]
media than there is the broadcast media that's true and yet there is no regulation at all on what they

[02:20:49.620 --> 02:20:54.240]
can print other than the libel law that's the only law that inhibits them to print any damn thing

[02:20:54.240 --> 02:20:59.420]
that they want absolutely okay well i'll let you get on to another caller okay thanks a lot we

[02:20:59.420 --> 02:21:05.140]
appreciate that i work over at my md a more campuses i've posted uh... to petitions in our department

[02:21:05.140 --> 02:21:09.540]
we're trying to get them around all four campuses great we appreciate your help okay niel thanks

[02:21:09.540 --> 02:21:13.440]
the media i would think to that uh... and maybe we've heard from them and i don't know because i'm

[02:21:13.440 --> 02:21:17.820]
not going through the mail there's just too much of it in the volunteers are but uh... wv we

[02:21:17.820 --> 02:21:22.460]
met the university of my m e and the mimey date station at fiu has a station and even kill you and

[02:21:22.460 --> 02:21:27.320]
hide and we get that nice letter from those good looking kids at killing high certainly they ought to be

[02:21:27.320 --> 02:21:32.960]
involved in this too right yes you bet especially killing high i think we can talk to the

[02:21:32.960 --> 02:21:36.820]
exactly they ought to be the volunteers they ought to be coming over here right now and uh...

[02:21:36.820 --> 02:21:42.080]
stuffing envelopes and anything else they can get their hands on some day we hope to quietly tell

[02:21:42.080 --> 02:21:48.220]
our story a story of two centers saved by grace okay and of course the grace is going to be our

[02:22:08.160 --> 02:22:15.360]
filthy parts that's when all of us girls would giggle and titter-rallot but in today's more dignified

[02:22:15.360 --> 02:22:20.320]
society i don't believe that this kind of language belongs on the radio

[02:22:21.460 --> 02:22:28.180]

[02:23:44.900 --> 02:23:48.860]
an article in the mianny herald on the front page of the local section that i don't know if you

[02:24:10.540 --> 02:24:14.760]

[02:24:14.760 --> 02:24:20.240]
incredible this is just a perfect example of hypocrisy and action it it it's just incredible the

[02:24:20.240 --> 02:24:24.680]
stuff with uh you know he mama broke in i don't want to hear this f s and all all these sort of

know whether you can't you know what it reminds me of did you see the movie injustice for all yes

[02:24:31.800 --> 02:24:36.280]
that's what it reminds me remember the judge the the guy who was sitting there swearing

[02:24:36.280 --> 02:24:42.120]
when he went nuts in the courtroom and the and the judge said uh what is with all this profanity

[02:24:42.120 --> 02:24:47.040]
and he said well judge i'm a diabetic and he said sir i feel to see the connection between

[02:24:47.680 --> 02:24:57.680]
being diabetic and all of these uh vulgar words you're using and he said that's because you're a

[02:24:58.240 --> 02:25:01.480]
well i just wanted to bring it to your attention the i know that you're going through some

[02:25:01.480 --> 02:25:04.860]

[02:25:04.860 --> 02:25:08.300]
ad if you really want to make an impression but you've seen it so that's my piece and i'll

[02:25:08.300 --> 02:25:12.020]
i'll just let it go with that thanks a lot they're take it easy okay yeah that hits a good point i

[02:25:12.020 --> 02:25:16.380]
don't know how many people saw highestons column in a heraldous morning but it all has to do with

[02:25:16.380 --> 02:25:21.360]
a scion court who was uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

[02:25:21.360 --> 02:25:25.200]
using f words and s words in a variety of others and the judge was having a nervous breakdown

[02:25:25.200 --> 02:25:31.800]
and uh kept increasing the fine uh or his bond he kept increasing it because he was getting

[02:25:31.800 --> 02:25:36.940]
so upset from the uh well one vulgarity beginning with the letter m and having an f somewhere

[02:25:36.940 --> 02:25:41.700]
in the middle is the way highest and describes it here and it's really a classic okay uh what

[02:25:41.700 --> 02:25:44.540]
just happened we got two lines open and date i'll never get too many way right

[02:25:47.540 --> 02:25:52.560]

plagiarism is envy and v is ignorance and ignorance is bliss and water sinks its own level

[02:26:48.500 --> 02:26:55.360]
so good luck you're getting in there okay sir all right thank you i think that was a message for Alice

[02:26:56.420 --> 02:27:01.800]
and judging from the numbers that we've got here he has found a new level that is just incredible

[02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:07.400]
i got to look at this again of course we don't have the hour by hour but in the 10 to 3 in the midday

[02:27:08.100 --> 02:27:17.400]
a day part the average quarter hour for iod they have 16,500 and nws has 16,200

[02:27:20.340 --> 02:27:27.740]
so even though it is very very close very close it looks like well i have to wait till we see the

[02:27:27.740 --> 02:27:32.240]
individual hours because Lee could certainly have done a big number in there from one to three you

[02:27:32.240 --> 02:27:38.580]
know what i mean like a one in each hour that great professional broadcaster Lee Fowler who sits on

[02:27:38.580 --> 02:27:44.940]
the air and rips his own people on the air as program director and who tells the rest of us about

[02:27:44.940 --> 02:27:51.420]
gutter broadcasting and about professionalism while he continues to do his sex pulls and wants to know

[02:27:51.420 --> 02:27:56.760]
where you did it unbelievable i know where he's doing it he's doing it right on the radio every day

[02:27:56.760 --> 02:28:02.180]
for two hours that's where he's doing it screwing the public and screwing that company

[02:28:03.460 --> 02:28:07.380]
just give me a chance i want to have an opportunity friends i've always competed well just

[02:28:07.380 --> 02:28:11.100]
that i don't believe in that kind of radio i'm not going to change i'm going to talk to my step

[02:28:11.100 --> 02:28:14.760]

[02:31:16.240 --> 02:31:20.280]
of that dark cloud at cd smith park from saturday i mean it was really a

[02:31:20.280 --> 02:31:23.020]
disastrous broadcast but out of even the most

[02:31:23.020 --> 02:31:27.260]
disastrous events in human history comes something positive

[02:31:28.040 --> 02:31:31.600]
and if that the hysteria in the part of the audience when i asked about taffy

[02:31:31.600 --> 02:31:34.280]
subjects if that finally got the message across

[02:31:34.280 --> 02:31:38.260]

[02:38:05.040 --> 02:38:06.280]
big walk on

[02:38:11.980 --> 02:38:13.120]

[02:38:28.880 --> 02:38:30.120]
Miami

[02:38:30.120 --> 02:38:31.100]
Fort Lauderdale

[02:38:33.080 --> 02:38:34.340]
I don't know you

[02:38:34.340 --> 02:38:35.480]

[02:38:35.480 --> 02:38:35.880]

[02:38:39.660 --> 02:38:40.060]
man

[02:38:40.060 --> 02:38:46.220]
Okay, that's going to do it here and certainly I told you we're going to close it out with a good call

[02:38:46.220 --> 02:38:47.100]
and we did and

[02:38:47.100 --> 02:38:52.320]

[02:38:52.880 --> 02:38:53.600]

[02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.120]
We found out a lot of interesting information today

[02:38:56.120 --> 02:38:59.520]
We found out about Bill Cosford and his shoe size and

[02:39:00.100 --> 02:39:00.920]
Keith Allen

[02:39:00.920 --> 02:39:03.680]
and about his size found out some good stuff today

[02:39:03.680 --> 02:39:07.180]
So at tomorrow morning we'll probably pick up right where we left off Michael Wolfe

[02:39:07.180 --> 02:39:10.820]
is here with some more of those wild headlines and then Daffy is going to be along today

[02:39:10.820 --> 02:39:15.820]
You just watch today you're going to see a different girl on the Taffy McCallum show

[02:39:16.600 --> 02:39:18.220]
One at W-I-N-Z

[02:39:18.220 --> 02:39:20.060]
Little blast from the past

[02:39:20.060 --> 02:39:22.480]
Boy I feel just like Ricky Tickey in the afternoon

[02:39:22.480 --> 02:39:24.460]
Only with a higher share

[02:39:24.460 --> 02:39:26.320]
And I'm cheese king

[02:39:28.460 --> 02:39:30.460]
It's making the news shit

[02:39:32.960 --> 02:39:36.780]
All of your folks are with the mom

[02:39:39.940 --> 02:39:43.640]
The check in the CDs

[02:39:43.640 --> 02:39:47.900]
No they never say please

[02:39:49.460 --> 02:39:53.240]
Just waiting for the early bird special to come

[02:39:57.740 --> 02:40:01.400]
Wasting away king good

[02:40:01.400 --> 02:40:10.760]
How they searching for the false teeth they left in a glass

[02:40:10.760 --> 02:40:20.600]
And how they claim that there's a talk host to play

[02:40:20.600 --> 02:40:22.780]
But they know

[02:40:24.380 --> 02:40:26.600]
It's their own damn phone

[02:40:36.520 --> 02:40:39.580]
The sugar in my

[02:40:41.600 --> 02:40:43.600]
Take it to early bird on time

[02:40:45.260 --> 02:40:49.360]
And wasn't just as hot as they came

[02:40:53.020 --> 02:40:55.860]
And once they are seated

[02:40:57.640 --> 02:41:00.120]
They get over she did

[02:41:01.540 --> 02:41:06.860]
It's dark stuff in the roses we know in their bags

[02:41:10.660 --> 02:41:14.500]
Wasting away king good or hot

[02:41:16.100 --> 02:41:22.780]
This bulletin just into the W-I-N-Z newsroom from one of our win superspies in his yellow Miami Herald Raincoat

[02:41:22.780 --> 02:41:28.500]
The first caller the inaugural caller on the Ron Saksho on W-Snow's

[02:41:29.240 --> 02:41:32.980]
Can they handle it?

[02:41:34.120 --> 02:41:35.940]
Harvey from Kendall

[02:41:45.500 --> 02:41:51.540]
And how did it say that it's all the clues a day

[02:41:52.500 --> 02:41:53.680]
But for some

[02:41:55.460 --> 02:41:57.760]
Can anyone in the police?

[02:42:02.500 --> 02:42:08.900]
Your folks don't know the reason why nothing is freezing

[02:42:10.140 --> 02:42:14.680]
The muscles ache and the teeth just don't fit

[02:42:14.680 --> 02:42:25.600]
But what doesn't matter when they call up Neil and Chattano

[02:42:26.900 --> 02:42:31.860]
I hate to kneel and never listen to your show

[02:42:35.020 --> 02:42:39.560]
But wasting away a king good or hot

[02:42:42.720 --> 02:42:46.860]
Just to fight the metal music and the radio

[02:42:51.780 --> 02:42:58.060]
And how did it claim that it's the top host to blame?

[02:42:59.060 --> 02:43:04.020]
But Neil knows they can't wait for his show

[02:43:08.060 --> 02:43:13.980]
And how did it claim that it's the top host to blame?

[02:43:15.080 --> 02:43:22.660]
But Neil knows they just can't wait for his show

[02:43:22.660 --> 02:43:29.800]
We have verification ladies and gentlemen and other W-I-N-Z Superspy has spotted Harvey from Kendall

[02:43:29.800 --> 02:43:32.960]
Harvey is wiping it off right now unbelievable

[02:43:32.960 --> 02:43:38.140]
And wasn't it Fowler this morning in the 87th W-Snow's programming seminar who said

[02:43:38.140 --> 02:43:42.280]
And we're going to get to as many callers as possible from now and we're really going to get through them

[02:43:42.280 --> 02:43:44.800]
Because there's nothing worse than repetitive chronic callers
