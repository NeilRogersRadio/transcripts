[00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.900]
They're going to be in town Saturday night and I want to know if you can give some tickets away on the air.

[00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.480]
Why have you got some? Yeah, I got a few. Oh sure. Oh great. Would you better get them out here tomorrow?

[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:18.680]
Well can I bring them by today? Yeah. Oh, okay. They're going to be at the Cameo Theater. No, not the Cameo. The colony.

[00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.180]
Oh, the colony. Well close and begin to see. Right down the street from one another. Very good. Yeah, they're right by each other.

[00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:31.160]
And also what I was thinking about it, you don't play a penis envy anymore. So I was trying to figure out why.

[00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:39.400]
And I figured it's okay for adults to hear it. And I know it's okay probably for pre-teeners to hear it because they're too young.

[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.840]
But for teenagers like the crowd on Saturday that was calling. I never went to the ice cream store and I have no desire to do it.

[00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.420]
But you had a lot of people call Saturday who went to that ice cream store. Yes. And that is a real young crowd.

[00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.520]
And I don't think that would be a good cry to listen to that song. That's right.

[00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.960]
I think it's because they never heard that word before. I'm sure you know penis. Yeah. Well, yeah. So often I guess so many times in one phone.

[00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:18.960]
Yeah. Too much. Yeah. Okay. So I'll say I'll come by this afternoon and give you what they say. Too much penis is too much. Too much. Yeah. That's what they say. Yeah. What they say. Yeah. I think that's exactly what they say.

[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:33.100]
Is that okay? I thought I'd heard that somewhere. Are you going to bring the tickets by? Are you going to just torment us? No. Why me do you want? Well, I'll tell you how about ten? That's okay. That's a nice even number.

[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:45.980]
Okay. And I'll stop by this afternoon and who knows. I might be able to give you while you're on the air. For that too much. We'll see what happens.

[00:01:45.980 --> 00:02:06.360]
Okay. Just show up and we'll see what happened. Okay. Okay. All right. Thank you so much. I thought. First call is always that wasn't the first call. It wasn't always a lady right at the beginning of the show talking about ice cream. We started right in. She must have stuck in that company. Are we giving? Are we giving them promotion or what? What am I getting?

[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:19.900]
I don't even get to look anymore. They keep giving me the wrong information. We drive all the way up there last night. It's got to be at least a seven minute ride from where I live. It's.

[00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:34.500]
Oh, and there's no chance that they're going to buy any time because we're giving them all this republishing. Right. No chance. It's right. No chance. And you would even be thrilled to cut their spot for when you they had no chance. Okay.

[00:02:35.700 --> 00:03:04.480]
And when I said about the sitting Brian over to co-host the show, no chance. Okay. I'm telling you I just there's no hope just surrounded by mortal enemies. Broward Hello. Yeah. Neal. How you doing? Okay. Oh, this is Dan. I moved down here from Chicago and January. I can't tell you. I love your show. Good good taste. I took my girlfriend listed at you back in Bollywood last night because I just moved back in. I don't know. Oh, I don't know. I'm just not sure I'm going to live in this area. So I'm going to be filming tonight and I'm going to eat some food. I'm going to be on a boat. I'm going to be on a boat. I'll be on my boat. I'm on a boat. I'm on a boat. I'm on a boat. I'm on a boat. I'm going to be on a boat. I'm on a boat. I'm on a boat. I'm on a

[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.660]

a Roger show now why would I get this piece of mail in my mail because it says the laughing jackass

[00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:41.520]
and it's obvious for you let me see that I'm an answer to the last thing why have you opened it yet

[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:48.480]
I wanted you to have a place it's I would open it up immediately and read it on the air and it says

[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:55.900]
yet out of town you've managed to ruin the best talk show how do you like that

[00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:03.440]
guess they told me you laughing jackass why would they put that in my mail you in sippard ibus

[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:12.760]
maybe we could have the dot ibus show there's a pot let's let's take some calls and just

[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.620]
please go off into corner and lay an egg or something will you?

[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:21.800]
Howard County hello how you doing Neil okay great I'm on new listener to your show I just started

[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:26.860]
listening about two weeks ago really yeah and I really liked a lot of never listening to any radio

[00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:32.440]
before okay but I was listening the other day during the week while I was at work you had one guy

[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:38.380]
on who was talking about he was real knowledgeable about all the radio stations and the format of all

[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:43.660]
the shows I was wondering what his name was Tom jikus okay yeah he was really good he had a lot of

[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:50.060]
great ideas and uh one thing I really agreed with what he said was where do these people get the ideas

[00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:54.640]
for these shows on some of these other stations like he talked about the one guy who came and he

[00:17:54.640 --> 00:18:00.660]
talked about garbage where do they get the ideas for this who's bought is that it's their own fault

[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:05.380]
see they would blame their producers because they all got producers that booked their guests but

[00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:09.500]
anybody who's got his own show who allows a producer to book that kind of guest who's got nobody to

[00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:14.900]
blame but himself but when of course then of course you go beyond that and you blame the management

[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:20.300]
for hiring board operators to do talk shows all right but what about the guy who's

[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:25.000]
taking you uh kind of sympathize with the guy who's kind of between a rock and a hard place where

[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.740]
if his producer doesn't do that what would you do if you couldn't do the type of formats you want

[00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:37.820]
to do with your walkers yeah we definitely walk of course okay one other thing I wonder

[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:42.320]
may happen at any moment sir people call me and like the rascade that you talked to before you

[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:47.340]
went to your news break yeah that's that aggravates me I don't know if it aggravates anybody else

[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:51.840]
but it seems like he's just getting on the air just to have time to hear himself on the radio well

[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:57.980]
I'd say that's about 90% of the people who call right just want to hear the sound of their own voice

[00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:04.300]
on the radio right okay all right Neil thank you very much and I really like your show okay thanks

[00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:08.740]
for the great call okay okay I got a couple of brown lines open out five two four

[00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:15.520]
9400 but my pop it apart press pass just arrived in the mail this morning and my life

[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:21.500]
has changed dramatically so we also want to thank Mary Lou from Hylia who sent little tiny

[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:28.280]
ceramic cat to go with Stan's alligator and the cat is looking at lunch right now aimed in your

[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:37.720]
direction so look out looks like a hungry pussy cat Dave County good morning hello yes Neil

[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:43.380]
yes of course let me ask you quite we couldn't you rid of him for love or money

[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:49.460]
what's the purpose of your data connection um good question that's a very good question that's a

[00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:56.760]
public affairs show they have to do uh public affairs every week no they don't yeah they tell

[00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:01.820]
they don't well I would lead to that I couldn't understand the witness purpose of their fork because

[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:06.440]
you didn't even talk about him basically you talk about events of the week that's what the show is

[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:35.140]
we talk about some events of the week yeah you're right we couldn't find the original so

[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:41.020]
do I apologize for that no problem this is you know no problem at all well it's supposed to be like a

[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:46.620]
fun show you know yeah I had no problem with that it's just that you had your mom and then at one

[00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:51.640]
point you mentioned the back you're gonna talk you know about his career or whatever you did none of that

[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:56.940]
oh I guess we ran out of time we were having such a good time you know oh well but it's

[00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:01.100]
supposed to be it's a public affairs show but we want it to be kind of a different public affairs

[00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:04.780]
show that it is listenable and you have a good time with it there wasn't a bad it's just gonna

[00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:09.500]
I can understand what this purpose is what it is I'll have him on again he's so out of fun to have

[00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:14.300]
sure let me give you the operative answer to your question there is no purpose to that show okay

[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:20.280]
there is no purpose believe me we were still trying to figure it out sir yeah

[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:25.640]
all right you got to take care okay you too have a good life excellent good color yeah and right

[00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:56.470]
yeah where does he play what position not tight end center center field of course he scores

[00:39:56.470 --> 00:40:02.730]
very good see he knew it he was just a little incomplete like most of most of those passes I got

[00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:07.650]
a Gary Huggabum was throwing yesterday for the cold I got it by the way that Gary Huggabum now

[00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:11.650]
there's a pretty interesting quarterback for the Indian that what are you laughing about you

[00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:15.150]
laughing at me well when he took his helmet off there toward the end of the game I said now why

[00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:19.250]
didn't you play the whole game without that I've made a lot more attention great I do yeah

[00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:23.810]
since he left the cowboys he's looking a lot better I'll tell you that and Danny White by the way

[00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:30.530]
talking about aging badly Danny White looks like he's about Joey Reynolds age at least about 60

[00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:36.270]
not that much I'm serious boy he is really aging rapidly because I guess if you played for Tom Landry you

[00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:42.750]
would do but boy yeah no I'm talking about his face I mean he looks like he's been through world

[00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:46.810]
war seven or something he used to be a good looking guy Danny White about like a couple years ago

[00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:53.970]
and he looks like hell he just aged and wrinkled and battered and uh oh gosh

[00:40:56.530 --> 00:41:03.530]
dreadful he's getting to look like Gary Lawrence I just say that in passing because Gary is in

[00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:07.630]
the building today and we want to let him know that we're aware that he's here with us

[00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:15.230]
is he with us yeah far as I know is he going to be in the againist book erected for what

[00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:23.430]
that's the point is so swift this guy I'm telling you this bird is about as swift as molasses on a

[00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:31.690]
bad thing or every part of his body is injured really Danny White from head to toe from stem to

[00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:33.290]
stern inside and out

[00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:47.630]

[00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:37.450]

[00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:04.390]
it was kind of clever once in a while but he was getting to the point of being a chronic regular

[00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:08.510]
that's on the and not only that but he was watering down his material of the point there were days he

[00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:13.690]
was calling when he was not funny I know what I'm saying yeah too much of a good thing I'm telling you

[00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:19.570]

[00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:10.890]
nothing hidden we don't have to monitor law rotate that's all it believe me sir okay do you

[00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:25.810]
derogatory of the show oh sorry I had it I might have missed that now we'll be glad to get it off

[00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:08.610]
bunch of stairs there any piece of equipment that's ever been invented they got about five or six

[00:51:08.610 --> 00:51:12.570]
just hanging around up there well that's because that's got all that money you got it all those

[00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:18.450]
spots all those big numbers you are going I was just wondering are you intend to get more involved

[00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:23.950]
because you're figuring what it costs you to go to a game at the stadium I never do I intend to

[00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:28.730]
get involved with what with these mung brains that are walking out no I'm not going to get involved

[00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:34.270]
I'm just counting my blessings I'm delighted I'm delirious you have no idea how pleased I am

[00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:38.930]
for the mung brains that would go watch a game for $26 to pick up yes so they could subsidize all

[00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:44.610]
these good loyal players yeah all right just a thought something you want to Monday screw them all

[00:51:44.610 --> 00:51:51.630]
right well this might be enjoyable well maybe on a Tuesday see you later later no okay by the way

[00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:56.090]

[00:54:42.690 --> 00:54:48.610]
instance but I don't know what what is happening over here I used to have a subject matter they

[00:54:48.610 --> 00:54:53.670]
used to carry before whether it was picking on the old ladies or picking on a pick or whatever it is

[00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:59.210]
and yeah you know in the essence really what is the topic and what can we talk about what what

[00:54:59.210 --> 00:55:06.590]
are the are the quality supposed to be the showdown because we're waiting for you Neil to

[00:55:07.250 --> 00:55:12.950]
throw something out of time we can get involved with I got news for you I could throw a wet dish rag

[00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:17.430]
at this audience and it would make a bit of difference okay I sat down here and I went through the

[00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:22.230]
Emmys and the football strike and about I don't know how many other things we talked about it doesn't

[00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:25.930]
make any difference what I talk about because they're not interested in what I talk about okay

[00:55:25.930 --> 00:55:34.750]
they don't care they don't care I had an extraordinary number of little notes at the bottom of the

[00:55:34.750 --> 00:55:38.370]
log today which I usually don't I even talked about Heather Locklear Courtney which all

[00:55:38.370 --> 00:55:45.030]
these wonderful macho guys out there they have nothing to say they're busy they're otherwise occupied

[00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:53.630]
now well anyway they told me that what's out there how it's turned in New York it's really

[00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:59.890]
bombing out now I mean no he's not who told you then he's friends of mine from well maybe he's

[00:55:59.890 --> 00:56:03.310]
that's his or they know they're out of their mind he's not bombing out he dropped like about a

[00:56:03.310 --> 00:56:07.590]
third of a point or something he's not bombing out you should be bombing like he's bombing I know

[00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:11.090]
I'm bombing right now myself well I didn't say that you did of course it's true but

[00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:16.610]
anyway well I don't know it it just sounds like the show is dragging along over here and

[00:56:17.810 --> 00:56:22.410]
we don't know what to do we're we're in a long time what do you mean it's dragging along I don't know

[00:56:22.410 --> 00:56:28.150]
almost 12 30 already I know but and before you know it'll be two o'clock and I'll be up front

[00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:32.270]
in the general manager's office we're ranging his furniture and throwing things in the business

[00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:38.390]
is usually you know okay well I mean you know we're doing the best we can under duress they're

[00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:42.830]
harassing us here and they're just creating a lot of mischief in the program trying to get me to

[00:56:42.830 --> 00:56:46.530]
you know walk out or something and they're working on it they're getting very close yeah hard

[00:56:46.530 --> 00:56:53.350]
asking you exactly they're giving us a rough time they're just creating a per a pattern of

[00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:59.290]
hardass and who cares is those idiots go on strike all those football players of course who

[00:56:59.290 --> 00:57:04.510]
gives a damn about that right I mean nobody let them go on strike I mean they want two million

[00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:09.690]
dollars a year now yeah they're they're owning half of the world now with their salaries let

[00:57:09.690 --> 00:57:14.350]
them all go to hell you know it's all like Mickey Mouse anyway it's all minor league I mean here

[00:57:14.350 --> 00:57:19.150]
the cowboys with her shall walk her and Tony Doris set in the same backfield and they look like a

[00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:25.250]
sandlot team okay so who needs who needs the NFL it's watered down to the point it's like pony

[00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:30.430]
league football they should bring up like Daryl Hall ought to be playing for the cowboys national league

[00:57:30.430 --> 00:57:35.650]
precipitation contest that that'll be great I watch that yeah they can do another one of those

[00:57:35.650 --> 00:57:40.450]
contrived things like they did with the armed the Indian wrestling and the slam dunk and all

[00:57:40.450 --> 00:57:45.610]
that other stupid to show us what great talent they've got right you know M. Tanka Indian yeah

[00:57:45.610 --> 00:57:50.670]
they can see who does the best ivory soap spot I don't think anybody can beat Steve Lardian but

[00:57:50.670 --> 00:58:02.750]
you know they're working on it yeah yeah okay have a wonderful life okay should we move along

[00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:07.290]
should we take our lives in our hands I guess sounds like some of the people in the audience already

[00:58:09.530 --> 00:58:10.130]
yeah

[00:58:10.130 --> 00:58:17.030]
Howard hello yes Neil yeah I know it's great well better listen real fast sir

[00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:22.310]
but that you better listen real fast not like on off the air any minute could be the last

[00:58:22.310 --> 00:58:27.550]
because if you go off the air there's like there's like a cloud hanging over it inside the building

[00:58:27.550 --> 00:58:33.370]
you know what I mean like a dark cloud hanging over this program one question yes that cloud raining

[00:58:33.370 --> 00:58:38.730]
be any minute yeah any minute in fact Brian Norcross is going to call and give the

[00:58:39.550 --> 00:58:45.630]
give the atmospheric conditions inside the building a little later on listen the show city

[00:58:45.630 --> 00:58:50.610]
milling in time out of the Matt Idiot Joey Reynolds I happen to have the unfortunate lock of

[00:58:50.610 --> 00:58:56.490]
catching his show this morning well I've I've stopped doing that and it's pure for you know or yeah

[00:58:57.130 --> 00:59:02.150]
and he has the nerve to insult you on the air I find no problem as long as he pronounces it right

[00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:06.570]
even my real name you know I wish he pronounced it right but the guys desperately you know even

[00:59:06.570 --> 00:59:13.030]
his comebacks are so weak they really are so weak he should his pictures should be in the

[00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:20.450]
dictionary for sophomore yeah anyway how about going into the time tunnel no no way we've had

[00:59:20.450 --> 00:59:25.930]
another enough sound effects already today last the lifetime okay anyway listen keep up the good work

[00:59:45.030 --> 00:59:49.750]
they say at the ice cream store well that's probably the only two they take one look at Stan and

[00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:53.910]
they're rolling on the ground holding their side that might be maybe he needs to go on come on

[00:59:53.910 --> 01:00:00.690]
now be nice okay be nice he's sensitive yes very sensitive guy he doesn't like anything but he's

[01:00:00.690 --> 01:00:05.570]
very sensitive okay can I just say one thing please it's not time hello mr. sharpie and Hollywood

you never know yeah but I just leave the reds the dice in the answers you know I'm looking

[01:11:55.530 --> 01:11:59.670]
for it to maybe a pod raise mariners won't carry yeah that sounds good to me or maybe the

[01:11:59.670 --> 01:12:04.990]
pod raising the Texas Rangers yeah that could be true too yeah so uh wonder if uh if the football

[01:12:04.990 --> 01:12:08.850]
pieces over with the one doesn't mean basketball we tried this long this year or maybe the pirates

pursuit everyone wants me on their team it's true Kyle's like the two he's got a head full of

[01:19:36.430 --> 01:19:41.710]
useless information also more than me as a matter of fact

[01:19:44.810 --> 01:19:52.390]
it was the right answer that's a recovered yet you're in shot no I would have expected him to say

[01:19:52.390 --> 01:19:58.390]
Joe Demade or a Babe Ruth you know or Lou Gehrig I just happen to know a lot of

[01:19:59.750 --> 01:20:05.990]

[01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:14.130]
Mojo man at 54 oh no this will pop into my head by the way before the hours over I guarantee it

[01:20:14.130 --> 01:20:20.170]
Mojo Andre Dawson leads the National League of Homeruns in my right with 44 oh this current to my right

[01:20:21.530 --> 01:20:26.450]
second in the National League of 41 I don't know is this current yeah I don't have a clue

[01:20:27.790 --> 01:20:36.950]
no no idea he plays right field for the Atlanta Braves he does milk commercials on WTBS

[01:20:38.190 --> 01:20:42.150]
well we know that you know it you don't have to put it on this screen I don't know

[01:20:43.130 --> 01:20:48.790]
honestly he looks like God and plays like no he's a good player

[01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:55.990]
you don't know Dale Murphy never heard that name I have heard the name if I said Robin Murphy

[01:20:55.990 --> 01:21:03.850]
no if I said Declan Murphy no if I said Bob Murphy who does the meds games on radio

[01:21:04.670 --> 01:21:10.130]
that he also doesn't add for the sporting news and he it does milf spots and God when he takes his cap

[01:21:10.130 --> 01:21:14.390]
off I have to shut off my stuff because I get very nervous okay we'll look up the Mojo men we'll

[01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:18.510]
take a break here when we come back we'll you know talk some more to these misfits on a year

[01:21:19.130 --> 01:21:23.490]
and they have been well I tell you when your best caller is sunny Fox that's a very good heavy

[01:21:23.490 --> 01:21:25.210]
comment on the show

[01:21:33.130 --> 01:21:39.070]
this is Jerry Langer Jerry Langer's marina Miami Beach and you know or a million dollars even

[01:21:39.070 --> 01:21:45.190]
Jerry's 358 Magnum wouldn't have done it right or even his 357 Magnum have it done our gun

[01:21:45.190 --> 01:21:53.110]
expert what he knows about music now there is something pretty interesting in his book yeah

[01:21:54.030 --> 01:21:57.570]
oh I heard a record the other day I couldn't believe it on on the magic

[01:21:58.890 --> 01:22:06.530]
I couldn't believe it Chris Montes and the more I see oh boy now he had two hit records the first

[01:22:06.530 --> 01:22:13.750]
was let's dance which was okay not great but pretty good but the more I see you great

[01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:21.750]
the more I see you great sound did just like Michael Jackson now if you ever seen Chris Montes and

[01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:31.570]
Michael Jackson together never never believe me the more I see you and the whole record is like

[01:22:31.570 --> 01:22:39.650]
off-keyed you remember that record oh boy vividly holy Toledo but anyway this

[01:22:39.650 --> 01:22:46.250]
while the album here is pretty strange Danny Wilson there must be some reason that was sad

[01:22:48.370 --> 01:22:51.310]
I don't know what it would be didn't he used to play quarterback go

[01:22:54.750 --> 01:23:01.230]
not Danny Wilson but you know but anyway Danny Wilson are see you always know there's something wrong

[01:23:01.230 --> 01:23:05.210]
because it says Danny Wilson are right the group which is kind of like soldier

[01:23:05.210 --> 01:23:05.750]
um

[01:23:06.910 --> 01:23:15.290]
Gary Clark Gerard grimes Kit Clark with lester buoys brass fantasy and David Palmer nils

[01:23:15.290 --> 01:23:21.650]
tuxen Allen Mglone and just like eight million names on here yeah that's a group and Jeff

[01:23:21.650 --> 01:23:28.490]
Doug Moore that sounds like a porno actor Jeff Doug Moore so anyway it might be pretty interesting

[01:23:28.490 --> 01:23:32.890]
and then of course we've got Brian Adams in the heat of the night excellent not like that Brian

[01:23:32.890 --> 01:23:34.670]
in a furry crap like a fan place.

[01:23:35.370 --> 01:23:36.750]
If he plays that one record,

[01:23:36.930 --> 01:23:38.010]
what does that overgates in your heart?

[01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:38.990]
Oh, God.

[01:23:39.330 --> 01:23:39.710]
Oh, God.

[01:23:40.330 --> 01:23:41.750]
And the only reason he plays it

[01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:43.230]
is because smoke gets in his throat,

[01:23:43.450 --> 01:23:44.110]
altering the show.

[01:23:47.150 --> 01:23:47.550]
Mobile.

[01:23:50.350 --> 01:23:53.470]
Okay, let's go to the state county, relax.

[01:23:53.690 --> 01:23:54.110]
Will you please?

[01:23:54.210 --> 01:23:54.410]
Hello?

[01:23:54.870 --> 01:23:55.570]
Yeah, what's up?

[01:23:55.830 --> 01:23:56.670]
Okay, what's up?

[01:23:56.810 --> 01:23:58.310]
That's the definitive question, sir.

[01:23:59.050 --> 01:24:00.510]
Yeah, I just had to get in a comment.

[01:24:00.750 --> 01:24:02.050]
And if we ever find it, boy,

[01:24:02.050 --> 01:24:03.070]
are we in big trouble?

[01:24:03.290 --> 01:24:04.390]
Well, we can all hunt.

[01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:06.590]
Listen, you think the Yankees are out of it, huh?

[01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:08.750]
You never believe that Sean Cassidy

[01:24:08.750 --> 01:24:11.170]
and Barry Manolo are on facing pictures

[01:24:11.170 --> 01:24:12.270]
in this book we got there.

[01:24:12.510 --> 01:24:14.570]
The number one hits of Billboard.

[01:24:15.390 --> 01:24:17.930]
Sean Cassidy and Barry Manolo together in stereo.

[01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:19.310]
The Yankees are finished.

[01:24:19.590 --> 01:24:20.770]
You don't you understand that thing?

[01:24:20.930 --> 01:24:21.210]
I did.

[01:24:21.610 --> 01:24:22.270]
I think it's right.

[01:24:22.690 --> 01:24:24.710]
They're almost mathematically out already.

[01:24:24.810 --> 01:24:25.950]
I heard New York fans.

[01:24:26.310 --> 01:24:26.930]
Oh, come on.

[01:24:27.330 --> 01:24:28.630]
How about those giants?

[01:24:29.650 --> 01:24:31.230]
Well, I went to that to start.

[01:24:31.230 --> 01:24:33.230]
They may be out when two after the next six weeks.

[01:24:33.390 --> 01:24:33.870]
Who knows?

[01:24:34.190 --> 01:24:36.290]
And how about those meds yesterday, huh?

[01:24:36.630 --> 01:24:37.990]
Oh, well, I can't say that.

[01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:40.010]
What a choke job, huh?

[01:24:40.090 --> 01:24:41.790]
Mr. Steinbreder's interview.

[01:24:41.970 --> 01:24:45.610]
He feels that he has not taken an active part

[01:24:45.610 --> 01:24:47.850]
because when he stopped taking an active part,

[01:24:48.030 --> 01:24:49.130]
they were four games ahead.

[01:24:49.490 --> 01:24:49.650]
Yeah.

[01:24:49.970 --> 01:24:53.490]
And now he says we're doing some changes in mid-season.

[01:24:53.650 --> 01:24:54.810]
Give me the end of the season.

[01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:57.130]
You know what his philosophy is?

[01:24:57.130 --> 01:24:57.390]
Hi.

[01:24:57.650 --> 01:24:58.750]
Miss with success.

[01:24:59.750 --> 01:25:02.370]
Listen, you're going to be doing the Yankees next year.

[01:25:02.570 --> 01:25:02.710]
No.

[01:25:03.050 --> 01:25:03.650]
Not at all.

[01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:06.530]
No, Channel 10's got all the UM sports locked up.

[01:25:06.750 --> 01:25:07.970]
So I'm out again, you know.

[01:25:08.050 --> 01:25:08.470]
That's a shame.

[01:25:08.670 --> 01:25:09.470]
In again, out again.

[01:25:09.770 --> 01:25:10.810]
I thought you did a fine job.

[01:25:10.970 --> 01:25:11.850]
Well, I appreciate that.

[01:25:11.910 --> 01:25:12.670]
I thought so too.

[01:25:12.810 --> 01:25:13.770]
That's a key up to good work.

[01:25:14.010 --> 01:25:15.230]
OK, thank you.

[01:25:15.230 --> 01:25:16.810]
Yeah, 10 if I can have you over.

[01:25:16.970 --> 01:25:17.150]
No.

[01:25:17.890 --> 01:25:18.290]
No.

[01:25:18.690 --> 01:25:20.730]
Easy weather for the hurricane baseball game.

[01:25:22.970 --> 01:25:24.350]
So we have plenty of prizes.

[01:25:24.630 --> 01:25:26.330]
Second time, you realize six years I've

[01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:29.970]
done you of baseball and both times now they've stuck it to me.

[01:25:33.770 --> 01:25:37.110]
Right in the back, a little stuff, which I'm used to.

[01:25:37.210 --> 01:25:38.590]
My back looks like Swiss cheese.

[01:25:38.790 --> 01:25:40.390]
I got more holes in my back in this town.

[01:25:41.090 --> 01:25:42.130]
One over here from Ed Cohen.

[01:25:42.610 --> 01:25:44.030]
Several over here from Mark Hune.

[01:25:48.610 --> 01:25:51.670]
A lot of loyalties in this town boy, they really stick by you.

[01:25:51.670 --> 01:25:52.030]
Hmm.

[01:25:55.610 --> 01:25:57.490]
Like this town ought to have a theme song.

[01:26:00.910 --> 01:26:04.190]
This is the definitive theme song for loyalties in South Florida.

[01:26:06.010 --> 01:26:09.650]
I bet you if we were doing that show on the FM, you'd want me to do the talk up on this.

[01:26:09.970 --> 01:26:12.950]
And I would step all over it and we'd all be real and embarrassed.

[01:26:13.530 --> 01:26:16.210]
When the night has come.

[01:26:16.290 --> 01:26:17.430]
OK, that's another bad thing.

[01:26:17.970 --> 01:26:19.370]
I don't want to get carried away.

[01:26:19.370 --> 01:26:21.330]
You'll pull out the River Phoenix pictures again.

[01:26:21.330 --> 01:26:25.010]
With all the lines going here, you'll destroy the tempo of the whole show.

[01:26:25.170 --> 01:26:25.570]
What are we doing?

[01:26:25.730 --> 01:26:27.970]
Tim is up there now with his diet soda and everything.

[01:26:28.090 --> 01:26:31.450]
What have we done to deserve your presence in the control room?

[01:26:32.050 --> 01:26:33.110]
Have we done something right?

[01:26:33.790 --> 01:26:34.690]
Watch him say no.

[01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:35.730]
Yeah, watch this.

[01:26:36.690 --> 01:26:43.190]
I mean, we feel like we've done something so evil and so almost unspeakable, haven't we?

[01:26:47.590 --> 01:26:48.890]
Well, OK, don't worry.

[01:26:48.890 --> 01:26:51.550]
We'll get back to media operative again and then everything will be OK.

[01:26:51.790 --> 01:26:52.510]
Everything will calm down.

[01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:57.210]
OK, let's take some calls from Broward because when it comes to media operative, hello.

[01:26:57.510 --> 01:26:58.230]
Hi, Neil.

[01:26:58.510 --> 01:26:59.430]
Hey, how you doing?

[01:26:59.710 --> 01:27:01.830]
OK, I just wanted to thank you for the album.

[01:27:01.990 --> 01:27:02.990]
I received the Saturday.

[01:27:03.110 --> 01:27:04.230]
What a beautiful voice.

[01:27:04.610 --> 01:27:05.150]
Oh, thank you.

[01:27:05.690 --> 01:27:07.090]
Doesn't she have a beautiful voice?

[01:27:07.770 --> 01:27:08.750]
Thank you. I heard.

[01:27:09.230 --> 01:27:11.050]
Hi, I like the little giggle.

[01:27:11.230 --> 01:27:14.650]
You mean all these people got their albums on Saturday except that one guy that

[01:27:14.650 --> 01:27:15.970]
called earlier who hasn't gotten it.

[01:27:16.090 --> 01:27:18.530]
We don't want to make him nervous, but if he didn't get it by Saturday.

[01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:20.470]
I received mine Saturday.

[01:27:20.730 --> 01:27:22.110]
Great. Now, which one did you get?

[01:27:22.530 --> 01:27:23.430]
Elvis is everywhere.

[01:27:23.710 --> 01:27:23.970]
Wow.

[01:27:24.790 --> 01:27:25.010]
Oh, yeah.

[01:27:25.310 --> 01:27:25.830]
In stereo.

[01:27:26.350 --> 01:27:26.490]
Yeah.

[01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:27.750]
Yeah, it's very nice.

[01:27:28.290 --> 01:27:28.610]
Great.

[01:27:29.430 --> 01:27:30.230]
Well, thank you, Neil.

[01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:31.670]
Is that it?

[01:27:32.010 --> 01:27:32.370]
Nice call.

[01:27:32.710 --> 01:27:32.830]
Yes.

[01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:34.710]
You mean you just called the thankers?

[01:27:34.990 --> 01:27:36.110]
I just called the thank you.

[01:27:36.210 --> 01:27:37.230]
That was really thoughtful.

[01:27:37.390 --> 01:27:37.870]
Thanks a lot.

[01:27:38.050 --> 01:27:38.650]
OK, bye-bye.

[01:27:38.750 --> 01:27:39.030]
Bye-bye.

[01:27:39.530 --> 01:27:39.790]
Wonderful.

[01:27:40.010 --> 01:27:42.030]
What a wonderful young lady from Broward.

[01:27:42.110 --> 01:27:43.990]
I told you, Broward is where it's at, right?

[01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:45.850]
I didn't say what.

[01:27:46.170 --> 01:27:52.890]
I can't believe her shon Cassidy and Barry Manelow on opposite pages here.

[01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:54.770]
Is that enough to make you just want to scream?

[01:27:54.990 --> 01:27:56.070]
Yes, mind boggling.

[01:27:56.090 --> 01:27:57.790]
He screams already just over here.

[01:27:59.010 --> 01:28:00.870]
And there's a certain talk host in town.

[01:28:00.930 --> 01:28:03.790]
If we sent this picture over, we would not be able to do his show this afternoon.

[01:28:03.930 --> 01:28:04.670]
Trust me.

[01:28:04.970 --> 01:28:07.210]
This afternoon he would not be able to do his show.

[01:28:07.270 --> 01:28:08.810]
He would be uncontrollable.

[01:28:09.070 --> 01:28:10.590]
It must be an afternoon in heat.

[01:28:11.370 --> 01:28:12.470]
Dave County, hello.

[01:28:13.390 --> 01:28:14.830]
Yeah, Neil Majors, please.

[01:28:15.310 --> 01:28:16.930]
OK, no, I'll just stand Rogers.

[01:28:17.090 --> 01:28:17.750]
Well, I do, sir.

[01:28:19.730 --> 01:28:21.470]
Listen, leave the humor to us, sir.

[01:28:21.490 --> 01:28:22.650]
OK, sorry about that.

[01:28:22.710 --> 01:28:23.170]
That's OK.

[01:28:23.410 --> 01:28:23.830]
I was good.

[01:28:23.970 --> 01:28:26.590]
Well, I had attempted the other part of this.

[01:28:26.810 --> 01:28:29.150]
I was going to make an appointment as he Dr. Heffinant.

[01:28:29.570 --> 01:28:31.670]
But I heard that he prescribed mineral

[01:28:31.670 --> 01:28:33.610]
ice for those areas that hurt you.

[01:28:34.810 --> 01:28:36.910]
Why don't you stop and see Dr. Bendova?

[01:28:37.230 --> 01:28:37.830]
OK, thank you.

[01:28:37.930 --> 01:28:37.930]

[01:28:38.290 --> 01:28:38.930]
OK, good luck.

[01:28:40.450 --> 01:28:41.470]
Dave County, hello.

[01:28:42.030 --> 01:28:43.230]
By doing good.

[01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:44.170]
What's up?

[01:28:44.170 --> 01:28:46.010]
I'd like to thank the bird for the football

[01:28:46.010 --> 01:28:47.270]
tickets for the sun.

[01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:49.170]
They come up and then view it strike.

[01:28:49.530 --> 01:28:49.690]
Have a.

[01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:54.230]
The light.

[01:28:54.630 --> 01:28:56.970]
Yeah, he comes up with some real useful stuff, doesn't he?

[01:28:57.170 --> 01:28:58.790]
Yeah, he said, well, things keep going that way.

[01:28:58.870 --> 01:29:00.090]
You can have seas and tickets too.

[01:29:00.550 --> 01:29:01.370]
Are you and now wait a minute.

[01:29:01.370 --> 01:29:02.110]
Let me ask you a question.

[01:29:02.230 --> 01:29:04.990]
Are you upset about the fact that we're obviously going to have the strike?

[01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:06.510]
No, I don't watch football anyway.

[01:29:06.650 --> 01:29:07.150]
Good for you.

[01:29:07.550 --> 01:29:08.190]
Good for you.

[01:29:08.230 --> 01:29:10.450]
I mean, there are a lot of us who have finally outgrown all of that.

[01:29:10.450 --> 01:29:11.110]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:29:11.370 --> 01:29:13.730]
I mean, maybe a little world federation wrestling.

[01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:16.610]
King Kong Bunty.

[01:29:16.790 --> 01:29:17.550]
Yeah, yeah.

[01:29:17.690 --> 01:29:18.710]
How's the white band Neil?

[01:29:18.990 --> 01:29:19.590]
How has it been?

[01:29:19.970 --> 01:29:20.130]
Yes.

[01:29:20.330 --> 01:29:21.570]
All in the wrong places here.

[01:29:21.730 --> 01:29:23.030]
It just piled high.

[01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:26.990]
Maybe we could use an opponent for band band big hello.

[01:29:27.230 --> 01:29:28.530]
No, no, I don't think so, sir.

[01:29:28.630 --> 01:29:29.290]
He's not my type.

[01:29:30.410 --> 01:29:31.030]
Droward, hello.

[01:29:31.410 --> 01:29:31.610]
Hello.

[01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:32.190]
Yeah.

[01:29:32.990 --> 01:29:33.730]
This is a mobile.

[01:29:33.870 --> 01:29:34.630]
Can I talk to Neil?

[01:29:34.770 --> 01:29:35.210]
A mobile.

[01:29:35.370 --> 01:29:36.590]
You're on the air right now, sir.

[01:29:36.690 --> 01:29:37.930]
Look at all the money we're saving you.

[01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:39.570]
Right now, this is unbelievable.

[01:29:40.830 --> 01:29:41.270]
Incredible.

[01:29:41.470 --> 01:29:42.730]
Yes, it's incredible.

[01:29:43.110 --> 01:29:47.290]
I have to why especially with a level of conversation so far is unbelievable.

[01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:49.230]
I can't believe it.

[01:29:49.250 --> 01:29:50.490]
Well, believe it.

[01:29:50.510 --> 01:29:53.170]
I can't because I'm trying to figure out where this ice cream

[01:29:53.170 --> 01:29:54.550]
parlour is on university.

[01:29:56.690 --> 01:29:58.890]
I'm driving up and down like crazy.

[01:29:59.150 --> 01:29:59.970]
Oh, boy.

[01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:02.750]
I'm going to tell you if I don't get a piece of the action in that store,

[01:30:02.750 --> 01:30:04.870]
well, depending on what kind of action it is, I guess.

[01:30:05.310 --> 01:30:06.470]
Just a joke, Brian.

[01:30:06.610 --> 01:30:07.830]
Don't get nervous now.

[01:30:08.150 --> 01:30:09.270]
Listen, I live in Berlin.

[01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:11.130]
I will go up there and put them under my wing.

[01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:13.010]
You nobody will get anywhere near that child.

[01:30:13.150 --> 01:30:13.870]
Believe me.

[01:30:13.870 --> 01:30:16.450]
They close the ice cream parlour in Davey.

[01:30:16.450 --> 01:30:17.350]
He can handle himself.

[01:30:17.710 --> 01:30:19.350]
And it's what he told me the other day.

[01:30:20.530 --> 01:30:21.590]
Leave me alone.

[01:30:21.710 --> 01:30:22.570]
I can handle myself.

[01:30:23.050 --> 01:30:24.390]
And I said, can I watch?

[01:30:25.130 --> 01:30:25.130]

[01:30:26.010 --> 01:30:26.310]
Yeah.

[01:30:27.770 --> 01:30:28.570]
There's a joke.

[01:30:29.610 --> 01:30:30.410]
Just a joke.

[01:30:30.970 --> 01:30:32.950]
It closed the other ice cream parlour.

[01:30:33.010 --> 01:30:35.010]
Well, when I pay a lot of money to see that, go ahead, sir.

[01:30:35.010 --> 01:30:35.450]
I'm sorry.

[01:30:35.650 --> 01:30:36.030]
It closed.

[01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:39.590]
Of course, they're going to close down all the other ice cream parlour

[01:30:39.590 --> 01:30:41.450]
because there's only one that counts.

[01:30:41.530 --> 01:30:42.230]
I know you.

[01:30:42.230 --> 01:30:44.630]
That's Neil and Stan's ice cream joint.

[01:30:44.770 --> 01:30:45.410]
I'm university.

[01:30:45.890 --> 01:30:46.110]
Right.

[01:30:46.390 --> 01:30:46.770]
What where?

[01:30:47.690 --> 01:30:48.830]
Where are you at, Fritz?

[01:30:49.290 --> 01:30:52.550]
Now, why is it you sound so before I give you the information?

[01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:55.150]
I'm a little nervous because you sound a little too anxious.

[01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:58.070]
I mean, you know, a little ice cream Sunday is fine,

[01:30:58.070 --> 01:31:00.630]
but it's not the beginning and end of the world.

[01:31:00.630 --> 01:31:01.290]
You know what I mean?

[01:31:01.670 --> 01:31:02.650]
Important to me, though.

[01:31:03.570 --> 01:31:06.830]
In other words, it's an emotional issue with you.

[01:31:07.110 --> 01:31:08.810]
I can't believe I'm in a lot of miles.

[01:31:08.910 --> 01:31:09.350]
I've been driving.

[01:31:09.930 --> 01:31:11.650]
Driving around like a madman.

[01:31:11.730 --> 01:31:13.330]
I'm in town, university drive.

[01:31:14.230 --> 01:31:15.250]
And I can't find it.

[01:31:16.110 --> 01:31:19.930]
You know, it's a big sign that's his ice cream right on the corner

[01:31:19.930 --> 01:31:21.490]
of that part of the strip shopping center.

[01:31:21.690 --> 01:31:25.970]
I mean, any dumbo who couldn't find it has got to be a mental case.

[01:31:26.150 --> 01:31:26.990]
Is it near Oakland?

[01:31:27.230 --> 01:31:27.470]
Is it near?

[01:31:27.650 --> 01:31:30.430]
It's north of Oakland on the east side.

[01:31:30.630 --> 01:31:31.870]
Well, north of Oakland, you know,

[01:31:31.870 --> 01:31:34.810]
the next main light, I think, is 44th.

[01:31:34.810 --> 01:31:34.950]
Yes.

[01:31:35.370 --> 01:31:35.710]
OK.

[01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:38.710]
Well, north of that, on the right hand side,

[01:31:38.710 --> 01:31:41.230]
there's that strip shopping center that goes on forever.

[01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:46.370]
And about in the first third, there's the Maryland Oyster

[01:31:46.370 --> 01:31:48.990]
Mung Place cholesterol palace.

[01:31:49.290 --> 01:31:51.770]
And just beyond that, there's a sprig

[01:31:51.770 --> 01:31:53.870]
in the store and just beyond that,

[01:31:54.050 --> 01:31:55.890]
it says ice cream and big letters,

[01:31:56.150 --> 01:31:57.330]
e-mac and bolioes.

[01:31:57.450 --> 01:31:58.350]
What's your favorite place?

[01:31:58.530 --> 01:31:59.030]
You've got a heartburn.

[01:31:59.630 --> 01:32:00.110]
What's that?

[01:32:00.630 --> 01:32:01.110]
It's a big day.

[01:32:01.870 --> 01:32:02.550]
The boss.

[01:32:03.290 --> 01:32:03.630]
What?

[01:32:04.010 --> 01:32:04.350]
E.K.

[01:32:05.230 --> 01:32:05.910]
Burger King.

[01:32:06.190 --> 01:32:06.950]
Oh, yeah.

[01:32:07.130 --> 01:32:08.630]
I still got a heartburn from this morning.

[01:32:08.910 --> 01:32:10.190]
Listen, thank you for a direction.

[01:32:10.350 --> 01:32:10.990]
Well, wait a minute.

[01:32:11.150 --> 01:32:12.490]
Now, why are you so hot?

[01:32:12.630 --> 01:32:13.350]
To call there immediately.

[01:32:13.730 --> 01:32:13.930]
Why?

[01:32:14.250 --> 01:32:14.770]
I have to.

[01:32:15.050 --> 01:32:15.330]
Why?

[01:32:15.650 --> 01:32:17.030]
So you said so much about it.

[01:32:17.090 --> 01:32:17.650]
And he's got it.

[01:32:17.790 --> 01:32:18.690]
Anyway, I got to go.

[01:32:18.750 --> 01:32:19.070]
OK.

[01:32:19.570 --> 01:32:20.290]
Good luck to you.

[01:32:20.390 --> 01:32:21.370]
They're not there right now, sir.

[01:32:21.470 --> 01:32:22.610]
They're in school, but that's all right.

[01:32:22.710 --> 01:32:23.390]
Get him out of the way.

[01:32:23.570 --> 01:32:23.710]
Really?

[01:32:24.130 --> 01:32:26.130]
Then they'll be able to see who this guy is.

[01:32:26.250 --> 01:32:27.610]
And then later on, they can kick him out.

[01:32:28.510 --> 01:32:29.490]
What the hell is this?

[01:32:31.370 --> 01:32:34.550]
The center is called Promenade of Inverrey.

[01:32:34.690 --> 01:32:35.610]
Well, a lot he does.

[01:32:36.350 --> 01:32:37.430]
It's in Lauderdale.

[01:32:38.310 --> 01:32:39.670]
But it's in Lauderdale.

[01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:46.950]
You know, that whole part of Broward County is so incredible.

[01:32:47.090 --> 01:32:48.810]
Remember what we did the thing about that publics?

[01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:51.790]
And we went on for hours and nobody would admit

[01:32:51.790 --> 01:32:54.310]
that that particular public is in their neighborhood.

[01:32:54.470 --> 01:32:56.670]
I mean, all it's in sunrise, no, it's in Inverrey.

[01:32:57.090 --> 01:32:57.450]
Right.

[01:32:58.330 --> 01:33:00.390]
Now, I would think that a lot of people

[01:33:00.390 --> 01:33:02.330]
would want to take credit for the ice cream stand.

[01:33:02.610 --> 01:33:03.590]
It's in Lauderdale.

[01:33:04.490 --> 01:33:05.830]
But it says in Ververe.

[01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:07.910]
But it says the Promenade of Inverrey.

[01:33:08.470 --> 01:33:10.890]
And on the opposite on the west side of the street

[01:33:10.890 --> 01:33:13.550]
is a strip shopping center that looks the same.

[01:33:13.830 --> 01:33:15.510]
It's got a little Italian restaurant.

[01:33:16.150 --> 01:33:19.010]
And there's a Japanese restaurant, a sushi place in there.

[01:33:19.650 --> 01:33:22.050]
I mean, how can I be any more specific than this?

[01:33:24.890 --> 01:33:29.130]
Well, if it's north of Oakland Park, it would be Inverrey, wouldn't it?

[01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.590]
Wow.

[01:33:30.150 --> 01:33:31.230]
It seems to me like it would.

[01:33:32.170 --> 01:33:35.490]
And any connoisseur in my audience who can't even just sniff

[01:33:35.490 --> 01:33:38.510]
it their way up to the ice cream store, good luck to you.

[01:33:38.910 --> 01:33:42.250]
Well, yeah, we have a lot of people in this audience who can't find it.

[01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:43.730]
Well, obviously there was a reason.

[01:33:44.210 --> 01:33:46.130]
You know, all those people that have those bumper stickers

[01:33:46.130 --> 01:33:47.230]
that say, I found it.

[01:33:47.650 --> 01:33:49.990]
Our listeners have bumper stickers that say, we lost it.

[01:33:51.810 --> 01:33:52.230]
Sorry.

[01:33:52.470 --> 01:33:54.030]
Well, this guy sounded like he was crying.

[01:33:54.030 --> 01:33:54.550]
That's hard.

[01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:55.530]
Yeah, he was desperate.

[01:33:55.670 --> 01:33:56.290]
Look out, Brian.

[01:34:00.130 --> 01:34:00.550]
Yeah.

[01:34:00.710 --> 01:34:01.250]
The Puhu.

[01:34:04.290 --> 01:34:04.650]
Yeah.

[01:34:04.690 --> 01:34:04.690]

[01:34:04.690 --> 01:34:06.610]
This is where we are.

[01:34:07.410 --> 01:34:09.730]
This is where we are.

[01:34:09.730 --> 01:34:10.710]
This is where we are.

[01:34:11.090 --> 01:34:12.130]
This is where we are.

[01:34:12.230 --> 01:34:13.510]
I don't like this.

[01:34:13.690 --> 01:34:14.690]
I don't like it.

[01:34:15.370 --> 01:34:16.350]
This is where we are.

[01:34:40.390 --> 01:34:40.790]
Okay.

[01:34:40.970 --> 01:34:43.510]
Here's a little takeoff from the Notre Dame game on Saturday.

[01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:46.450]
For those partings, are they good or what, huh?

[01:34:46.770 --> 01:34:47.330]
They are tough.

[01:34:47.990 --> 01:34:49.410]
Okay, let's go to the Broward.

[01:34:49.450 --> 01:34:49.650]
Hello.

[01:34:52.030 --> 01:34:52.650]
Good call.

[01:34:54.050 --> 01:34:54.410]
Yo.

[01:34:54.910 --> 01:34:55.330]
Yes, sir.

[01:34:55.850 --> 01:34:56.430]
All right.

[01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:57.370]
All right.

[01:34:57.610 --> 01:34:57.970]
What's up?

[01:34:58.750 --> 01:35:02.010]
Yeah, this is Ray from the beach down at Mary at the Habib beach.

[01:35:02.110 --> 01:35:02.630]
I'll hold it out.

[01:35:02.730 --> 01:35:03.590]
Let me look into the show.

[01:35:03.790 --> 01:35:04.630]
It's my first call in.

[01:35:04.770 --> 01:35:05.070]
Yeah, Ray.

[01:35:05.190 --> 01:35:06.810]
What's going on over there on the beach anyway?

[01:35:07.130 --> 01:35:08.150]
Well, I mean, that's so big.

[01:35:08.150 --> 01:35:09.150]
That big, let's take off.

[01:35:09.390 --> 01:35:11.310]
Just coming into the portal here.

[01:35:11.310 --> 01:35:15.470]
You can go out there, fire off his gun, and cut his squirt and water and all that.

[01:35:15.870 --> 01:35:18.430]
A lot of boats out there, and paddails, helicopters.

[01:35:19.210 --> 01:35:20.090]
Nice day down here.

[01:35:20.510 --> 01:35:20.730]
Yeah.

[01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:22.870]
Yeah, you can stop down some time.

[01:35:23.010 --> 01:35:23.370]
Okay.

[01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:24.690]
I want to make a beginning here.

[01:35:24.850 --> 01:35:26.110]
Sure, sounds good to me, Ray.

[01:35:26.290 --> 01:35:27.050]
You dig it.

[01:35:27.510 --> 01:35:28.150]
Yeah, I'll bet.

[01:35:28.670 --> 01:35:28.910]
All right.

[01:35:29.330 --> 01:35:30.830]
I just wanted to call in and say hi.

[01:35:31.010 --> 01:35:31.630]
I enjoy your show.

[01:35:31.830 --> 01:35:32.870]
I was doing quite a bit.

[01:35:33.210 --> 01:35:33.530]
I know.

[01:35:33.710 --> 01:35:33.910]
I know.

[01:35:34.010 --> 01:35:34.350]
I have to beach.

[01:35:34.870 --> 01:35:36.750]
Well, let me, can I ask you again one more time?

[01:35:36.890 --> 01:35:40.910]
Now, Saturday night I was over on the beach and it was like spring break over there.

[01:35:40.910 --> 01:35:42.690]
I just, I was sorry that I went over.

[01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:43.310]
Yeah.

[01:35:44.010 --> 01:35:47.070]
I don't go to the beach too much on the weekend, especially at night.

[01:35:47.250 --> 01:35:48.610]
I worked down here during the days.

[01:35:48.770 --> 01:35:49.390]
I got you.

[01:35:49.490 --> 01:35:51.070]
I enjoy the beach during the days.

[01:35:51.190 --> 01:35:51.270]
Yeah.

[01:35:51.370 --> 01:35:53.470]
I stay out, you know.

[01:35:54.110 --> 01:35:56.430]
It's, uh, I can really couldn't tell you what goes on there.

[01:35:56.730 --> 01:35:56.930]
Good.

[01:35:57.210 --> 01:35:58.990]
Well, we probably couldn't put it on the air either.

[01:35:59.990 --> 01:36:00.590]
Okay, Ray.

[01:36:00.630 --> 01:36:01.170]
Thanks a lot.

[01:36:01.450 --> 01:36:01.730]
Okay.

[01:36:01.890 --> 01:36:03.110]
Good to talk to you.

[01:36:03.150 --> 01:36:03.390]
Okay.

[01:36:03.790 --> 01:36:04.050]
Bye-bye.

[01:36:04.590 --> 01:36:05.970]
No, I'm curious about one thing.

[01:36:06.050 --> 01:36:09.570]
Now, spring break, of course, is like, or was in the past tense.

[01:36:09.570 --> 01:36:11.050]
It was like a ritual.

[01:36:11.710 --> 01:36:17.550]
So we can understand all those kids walking back and forth up and down on the streets and on the sidewalk everywhere.

[01:36:18.090 --> 01:36:23.550]
But like Saturday night, it's the same thing in all these kids who are obviously local and area kids.

[01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:28.090]
And some of them indescribable, by the way, but that's another story.

[01:36:28.570 --> 01:36:32.330]
But anyway, they're walking up and down and back and forth and there.

[01:36:32.430 --> 01:36:39.370]
Then they're the ones, of course, who are sitting like on the balconies and sitting in the various bars and just looking down and watching everybody walking up and back.

[01:36:39.370 --> 01:36:40.770]
What the hell are they doing?

[01:36:40.910 --> 01:36:41.810]
Nothing's going on.

[01:36:42.070 --> 01:36:44.230]
Nobody's, you know, doing anything.

[01:36:44.230 --> 01:36:46.790]
It reminds you of almost like standing in me in the Broward Mall.

[01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.350]
You know what I mean?

[01:36:47.470 --> 01:36:52.150]
I mean, there's a lot of looking going on and there's a lot of great bodies there, but nobody's doing anything.

[01:36:52.770 --> 01:36:53.810]
That's where it always is.

[01:36:54.270 --> 01:36:54.430]
Boy.

[01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:55.110]
Yeah.

[01:36:56.470 --> 01:36:57.410]
You know what it reminds me of?

[01:36:57.410 --> 01:37:00.810]
It reminds me of going into a bar, which is why I've always hated bars and I don't go into them.

[01:37:00.870 --> 01:37:05.030]
Because what you see is a lot of other people standing around looking at each other.

[01:37:05.810 --> 01:37:06.890]
I mean, forever.

[01:37:08.730 --> 01:37:16.850]
And then like maybe a 3.34 in the morning when it's all cleaned out, you know, then people of the most desperate of the desperate are still there.

[01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:22.310]
And generally what happens is that the most desperate people kind of pair off and they all go and, you know,

[01:37:23.050 --> 01:37:25.450]
and of course I'm still there at five and there's nobody left.

[01:37:25.810 --> 01:37:34.050]
So it's like what I was in a high school in gym class and it would pick kids for the basketball, not for the regular basketball team, but just in gym class.

[01:37:34.050 --> 01:37:39.070]
And it would pair off, you know, and it would pick you and it would always be a couple of us would be the last kids chosen.

[01:37:39.070 --> 01:37:39.290]
Right.

[01:37:39.530 --> 01:37:41.250]
Because we weren't what you call super athlete.

[01:37:41.470 --> 01:37:41.690]
Right.

[01:37:43.710 --> 01:37:44.070]
Right.

[01:37:44.070 --> 01:37:45.570]
I was never picked last though.

[01:37:45.770 --> 01:37:46.410]
Right field.

[01:37:46.650 --> 01:37:48.210]
Never picked last where they always put you.

[01:37:48.410 --> 01:37:49.350]
It was a left field.

[01:37:49.850 --> 01:37:53.030]
They put you in the, if you're playing in the basketball game.

[01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:54.270]
Oh, yeah.

[01:37:54.510 --> 01:37:55.250]
Left field.

[01:37:56.750 --> 01:37:57.110]
Okay.

[01:37:57.250 --> 01:38:00.030]
Cross out the Mickey Mantle on your scorecard, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:38:00.190 --> 01:38:02.670]
That was just strictly an aberration if there ever was one.

[01:38:03.770 --> 01:38:04.890]
Actually, let's do that.

[01:38:04.990 --> 01:38:05.150]
Yeah.

[01:38:06.150 --> 01:38:09.430]
And put down Hank Bauer as they set her on your basketball team.

[01:38:10.990 --> 01:38:12.890]
And Gene Woodling is it forward.

[01:38:14.590 --> 01:38:16.270]
And Yogi Berra is the goalie.

[01:38:17.070 --> 01:38:18.110]
We got this all straightened out.

[01:38:19.010 --> 01:38:20.570]
And the quarterback can be whitey forward.

[01:38:21.710 --> 01:38:22.030]
Yeah.

[01:38:22.810 --> 01:38:23.870]
That's good to be one.

[01:38:24.910 --> 01:38:28.770]
Twenty before two on our on W Y and Z your sports stage.

[01:38:30.430 --> 01:38:31.770]
Listen, we got enough sports.

[01:38:31.770 --> 01:38:33.970]
We got IOD is going nuts with sports.

[01:38:33.970 --> 01:38:34.310]
Right.

[01:38:34.390 --> 01:38:35.190]
A few a.m. now.

[01:38:35.350 --> 01:38:38.290]
They got the sports exchange and the sports this.

[01:38:38.550 --> 01:38:40.350]
I mean, it's great that they got the meds games.

[01:38:40.350 --> 01:38:42.210]
Even if we do have to listen to Bob Murphy.

[01:38:42.410 --> 01:38:46.850]
But boy, they have got more sports talk in this town in a non sports town.

[01:38:46.850 --> 01:38:47.210]
Yeah.

[01:38:47.410 --> 01:38:48.210]
Just obsessed.

[01:38:48.790 --> 01:38:51.190]
So I think what we need is another good sports station.

[01:38:52.690 --> 01:38:53.830]
Let's take our last break.

[01:38:53.830 --> 01:38:56.510]
And when we come back, maybe we'll even break out into our new format.

[01:38:56.510 --> 01:39:01.710]
I'm a woman and a smoker that used to be a sophisticated combination.

[01:39:02.030 --> 01:39:03.570]
Men got lung cancer.

[01:39:03.770 --> 01:39:05.470]
We just got cigarette breath.

[01:39:05.810 --> 01:39:06.870]
Now we get both.

[01:39:07.250 --> 01:39:10.330]
If you're a woman who smokes and wants to stop the quit.

[01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:13.750]
Tello Joey Tempest, one of the earrings down to his puppet.

[01:39:14.410 --> 01:39:15.550]
And John Levain.

[01:39:15.890 --> 01:39:16.410]
Levain?

[01:39:16.850 --> 01:39:17.210]
Levon.

[01:39:17.750 --> 01:39:22.510]
Nealing, Ian Houghland, when there's four guys standing in one guy, Nealing, look out.

[01:39:22.510 --> 01:39:23.150]
Really?

[01:39:23.710 --> 01:39:25.230]
But they're a pretty interesting group.

[01:39:25.390 --> 01:39:26.250]
Joey Tempest.

[01:39:26.830 --> 01:39:30.670]
And of course, if we could team him up with our production lady, we could have a Tempest

[01:39:30.670 --> 01:39:31.230]
in the T-Pot.

[01:39:35.990 --> 01:39:37.850]
Although I don't think he would stay in the T-Pot.

[01:39:37.890 --> 01:39:39.570]
He might come out like an I dream of Jeannie.

[01:39:39.810 --> 01:39:41.450]
He might come flying out.

[01:39:42.110 --> 01:39:44.710]
Okay, let's take some more calls because we're getting short on time.

[01:39:44.950 --> 01:39:47.310]
And no one has seen a Heidner hair of Mr. Major.

[01:39:47.470 --> 01:39:49.230]
Now could it be that I told you he got a number?

[01:39:49.890 --> 01:39:50.930]
He got a number.

[01:39:51.750 --> 01:39:52.150]
No.

[01:39:52.450 --> 01:39:52.770]
No.

[01:39:52.890 --> 01:39:53.730]
No, you don't think so?

[01:39:53.970 --> 01:39:55.050]
Today could be the magic day.

[01:39:55.190 --> 01:39:55.290]
No.

[01:39:55.470 --> 01:39:57.830]
He could come in here with a big smile on his face.

[01:39:58.010 --> 01:39:58.010]

[01:39:58.010 --> 01:39:58.590]
We can only hold.

[01:39:58.790 --> 01:40:00.190]
Smoking two cigars.

[01:40:00.450 --> 01:40:01.070]
Can only hold.

[01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:05.430]
We just went into the orifice.

[01:40:05.790 --> 01:40:06.210]
Told you.

[01:40:06.930 --> 01:40:07.330]
Okay.

[01:40:07.530 --> 01:40:08.230]
Told you it'd be here.

[01:40:09.110 --> 01:40:11.050]
Any minute, he's going to come in with the exciting tail.

[01:40:12.670 --> 01:40:13.310]
Broward County.

[01:40:13.450 --> 01:40:13.630]
Hello.

[01:40:13.990 --> 01:40:14.350]
Hi, Neil.

[01:40:14.750 --> 01:40:15.150]
Yes, sir.

[01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:18.030]
Hey, you are a redeeming yourself in my eyes today.

[01:40:18.030 --> 01:40:19.530]
What did I do, sir?

[01:40:19.730 --> 01:40:20.850]
Please tell me something good.

[01:40:20.850 --> 01:40:22.350]
You mentioned Heidner Locklear.

[01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:22.990]
Oh, boy.

[01:40:23.130 --> 01:40:23.630]
Now we're talking.

[01:40:23.650 --> 01:40:24.110]
It's so hot.

[01:40:24.410 --> 01:40:24.990]
She is.

[01:40:25.150 --> 01:40:25.490]
Yeah.

[01:40:25.650 --> 01:40:28.650]
She is on something on TV contrary to what Glenn believes.

[01:40:28.910 --> 01:40:30.210]
She's Sandy Joe in Dynasty.

[01:40:30.530 --> 01:40:31.510]
Say there you go.

[01:40:31.650 --> 01:40:32.010]
Well, I'll say.

[01:40:32.090 --> 01:40:33.290]
I watch the show, but I do know.

[01:40:33.370 --> 01:40:36.810]
I want to tell you if I were so inclined, if you know what I mean, if I were so inclined,

[01:40:36.810 --> 01:40:37.670]
I would just...

[01:40:37.670 --> 01:40:40.350]
I'd be fantasizing about her round the clock.

[01:40:40.510 --> 01:40:42.630]
I would have every picture, every fold out.

[01:40:42.810 --> 01:40:44.170]
I mean, she is...

[01:40:44.170 --> 01:40:46.090]
I don't understand what these people get up.

[01:40:46.090 --> 01:40:49.270]
I'm all excited about Fawn Hall and these washed out really

[01:40:49.270 --> 01:40:51.170]
Ika-Bod crane-looking type robots.

[01:40:51.970 --> 01:40:52.370]
Am I right?

[01:40:52.650 --> 01:40:54.070]
And Joan Collins is another one.

[01:40:54.150 --> 01:40:55.410]
You know, she looks like your grandmother.

[01:40:55.730 --> 01:40:56.050]
Yeah.

[01:40:56.670 --> 01:40:57.090]
She...

[01:40:57.090 --> 01:40:58.770]
Joan Collins is way past her.

[01:40:58.830 --> 01:40:59.490]
What a bag.

[01:41:00.110 --> 01:41:03.410]
There is one thing about Heidner Locklear that kind of killed Vanisies, though.

[01:41:03.510 --> 01:41:04.970]
If you ever saw the husband she married.

[01:41:05.230 --> 01:41:06.030]
Yeah, we have a picture.

[01:41:06.130 --> 01:41:07.150]
Oh, is one of these team members.

[01:41:07.150 --> 01:41:08.570]
And one of these magazine covers a picture.

[01:41:08.830 --> 01:41:09.930]
He's from Motley Crew.

[01:41:10.090 --> 01:41:10.790]
Well, let me see it.

[01:41:11.290 --> 01:41:11.570]
Right?

[01:41:11.810 --> 01:41:13.010]
He's a guy from Motley Crew.

[01:41:13.090 --> 01:41:13.090]

[01:41:13.130 --> 01:41:16.030]
Maybe I'm missing out on something here.

[01:41:16.030 --> 01:41:16.430]
Is that fine?

[01:41:17.470 --> 01:41:18.470]
It's in the marriage.

[01:41:19.170 --> 01:41:20.030]
There's a section on...

[01:41:21.830 --> 01:41:22.170]
Oh, yeah.

[01:41:22.230 --> 01:41:24.270]
That's one that had Darryl Oates and that other guy.

[01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:25.250]
Yeah, the married section.

[01:41:25.690 --> 01:41:28.530]
Well, it's something about any woman named Heather.

[01:41:28.650 --> 01:41:29.250]
Don't you agree?

[01:41:29.650 --> 01:41:31.210]
Well, just the way she looks is that face.

[01:41:31.450 --> 01:41:33.910]
She could have almost any kind of a body, but she has that purple,

[01:41:34.250 --> 01:41:36.270]
all American farm girl face.

[01:41:36.530 --> 01:41:37.690]
She just too pretty for words.

[01:41:37.870 --> 01:41:40.510]
Yeah, but she matches her name, you know.

[01:41:40.710 --> 01:41:41.430]
She looks like her.

[01:41:41.630 --> 01:41:41.630]

[01:41:41.630 --> 01:41:43.190]
Oh, he's out of her name, match her face.

[01:41:43.350 --> 01:41:43.530]
Yeah.

[01:41:43.710 --> 01:41:44.510]
That's her real name, right?

[01:41:44.510 --> 01:41:45.050]
Yeah, exactly.

[01:41:45.110 --> 01:41:46.230]
I don't know either, but she looks like her.

[01:41:46.230 --> 01:41:46.750]
Oh, here she is.

[01:41:46.850 --> 01:41:47.070]
There she is.

[01:41:47.090 --> 01:41:48.630]
There's Ellie, Shede, and Steve Ross.

[01:41:49.490 --> 01:41:49.650]
Right.

[01:41:50.010 --> 01:41:52.850]
There's John Revolta and Mary Lou Henner.

[01:41:53.750 --> 01:41:54.130]
Mm-hmm.

[01:41:54.150 --> 01:41:57.410]
Tony Danza, who's enough to make you want to never go to the Brooklyn again.

[01:41:58.410 --> 01:42:01.910]
There's Pat Peterson and Nicolette Sheridan from Notts Landing.

[01:42:02.670 --> 01:42:04.150]
Oh, I'll watch this show if I know it.

[01:42:04.470 --> 01:42:05.570]
Oh, let me tell you something.

[01:42:05.810 --> 01:42:06.330]
What's the name of the soap?

[01:42:06.890 --> 01:42:08.330]
Pat Peterson and Nicolette Sheridan.

[01:42:08.370 --> 01:42:09.870]
I think either one of them would do it for you.

[01:42:10.090 --> 01:42:13.090]
But where's this picture you were telling me about?

[01:42:13.450 --> 01:42:14.790]
Couples we would like to see.

[01:42:14.910 --> 01:42:15.290]
Is that it?

[01:42:16.450 --> 01:42:17.430]
Are they here somewhere?

[01:42:17.630 --> 01:42:19.850]
There's Brian Bloom and Allison Smith.

[01:42:20.510 --> 01:42:21.230]
No PBK?

[01:42:21.710 --> 01:42:21.970]
No.

[01:42:23.110 --> 01:42:25.190]
Cory Feldman and Holly Draugh.

[01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:26.170]
No, that's not that.

[01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:26.810]
That's not it.

[01:42:27.030 --> 01:42:27.610]
That's not it.

[01:42:27.810 --> 01:42:28.430]
I'm going to have to.

[01:42:28.710 --> 01:42:29.150]
Oh, boy.

[01:42:29.630 --> 01:42:31.310]
We've only got ten minutes left in the show.

[01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:32.750]
Well, we'll find it.

[01:42:32.750 --> 01:42:33.270]
Believe me.

[01:42:33.330 --> 01:42:33.950]
I'll find it.

[01:42:34.030 --> 01:42:35.290]
Anybody I know can find it.

[01:42:35.430 --> 01:42:35.910]
Oh, there they are.

[01:42:36.030 --> 01:42:37.050]
Daryl Hall and Cory Hart.

[01:42:37.210 --> 01:42:37.790]
I know him anywhere.

[01:42:39.010 --> 01:42:41.370]
Okay, well, I can commend you on your good taste, sir.

[01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:42.130]
All right.

[01:42:42.130 --> 01:42:46.470]
Hey, does your phone system have the capability to let a caller go out through your PA system?

[01:42:46.990 --> 01:42:47.270]
No.

[01:42:47.710 --> 01:42:48.350]
Too bad.

[01:42:48.490 --> 01:42:49.130]
Oh, here they are.

[01:42:49.330 --> 01:42:50.990]
Tommy Lee and Heather Locklear.

[01:42:51.810 --> 01:42:53.050]
Now, what are you talking about?

[01:42:53.170 --> 01:42:54.370]
He's grotesque.

[01:42:54.590 --> 01:42:55.190]
What do I mean?

[01:42:55.390 --> 01:42:57.550]
Oh, and he's got all these tattoos on his arms.

[01:42:57.630 --> 01:42:58.630]
He looks like mong.

[01:42:59.070 --> 01:42:59.310]
Ah!

[01:42:59.690 --> 01:43:02.450]
I'd like to see the look with her parents face when she brought him home to celebrate.

[01:43:02.510 --> 01:43:03.470]
Oh, my God.

[01:43:03.530 --> 01:43:05.570]
And he's got an earring down to his pupick.

[01:43:05.930 --> 01:43:07.190]
All right.

[01:43:07.290 --> 01:43:07.990]
And you'll have a good one.

[01:43:08.270 --> 01:43:09.070]
Eat your heart out.

[01:43:09.370 --> 01:43:09.630]
All right.

[01:43:09.730 --> 01:43:09.930]
Bye-bye.

[01:43:09.930 --> 01:43:10.370]
Okay.

[01:43:10.630 --> 01:43:10.970]
Good.

[01:43:11.330 --> 01:43:11.770]
God.

[01:43:12.110 --> 01:43:14.710]
Now, I understand talking about that a lot, and it's so true.

[01:43:15.610 --> 01:43:20.210]
These couplings were that one of the two people is really incredible looking, and the other one

[01:43:20.210 --> 01:43:22.170]
looks like just deadly.

[01:43:22.470 --> 01:43:22.750]
I know.

[01:43:23.470 --> 01:43:23.910]
horrendous.

[01:43:24.570 --> 01:43:26.070]
It's a prime example.

[01:43:26.490 --> 01:43:28.890]
Well, here he is, ladies and gentlemen, with the big word.

[01:43:30.030 --> 01:43:32.090]
We're looking at him face very carefully.

[01:43:34.270 --> 01:43:35.350]
The answer is no.

[01:43:36.970 --> 01:43:39.590]
Here is Tom Cruise and Mimi Rogers.

[01:43:40.130 --> 01:43:40.270]
Right.

[01:43:40.490 --> 01:43:41.350]
And there's another example.

[01:43:41.470 --> 01:43:42.070]
She's okay.

[01:43:42.370 --> 01:43:42.990]
She's fine.

[01:43:43.370 --> 01:43:45.150]
But he can do better than that.

[01:43:45.450 --> 01:43:45.970]
Right?

[01:43:46.350 --> 01:43:48.030]
And there's Emilio Estreves.

[01:43:48.570 --> 01:43:49.170]
Oh, boy.

[01:43:49.290 --> 01:43:49.770]
Who's he would?

[01:43:49.910 --> 01:43:51.910]
And Demi Moore from about last night.

[01:43:52.590 --> 01:43:53.110]
Dinti Moore?

[01:43:53.470 --> 01:43:54.250]
Demi Moore.

[01:43:54.750 --> 01:43:55.850]
Yeah, Dinti Moore.

[01:43:56.270 --> 01:43:59.530]
He belongs with Dinti Moore, I'll tell you.

[01:43:59.650 --> 01:44:00.490]
He's real cute.

[01:44:00.830 --> 01:44:04.490]
Oh, and look at the earring that this Emilio has got in his ear.

[01:44:04.490 --> 01:44:05.870]
It's the size of a walrus.

[01:44:07.890 --> 01:44:08.990]
Oh, my God.

[01:44:09.070 --> 01:44:10.310]
What is this thing with the earrings?

[01:44:10.430 --> 01:44:13.650]
And here's Kevin Bacon, who looks like he's been making bacon.

[01:44:14.070 --> 01:44:14.830]
Yeah, Bruce Willis.

[01:44:14.930 --> 01:44:15.570]
That's that on the image.

[01:44:15.850 --> 01:44:16.130]
He's crazy.

[01:44:16.310 --> 01:44:17.610]
Paul Earrings is hanging.

[01:44:17.630 --> 01:44:21.490]
Bruce Willis is one of the most disgusting, no-talented people in the history of mankind.

[01:44:21.910 --> 01:44:23.110]
I don't understand that at all.

[01:44:24.370 --> 01:44:25.830]
Emilio looks pretty good here.

[01:44:25.890 --> 01:44:26.590]
I'll be honest with you.

[01:44:26.610 --> 01:44:27.790]
If you would just keep his mouth shut.

[01:44:27.990 --> 01:44:31.210]
You know, but he doesn't have that same psychotic look that he always has.

[01:44:32.090 --> 01:44:32.490]
Psychotic.

[01:44:32.670 --> 01:44:34.030]
There's something wrong with that child.

[01:44:34.030 --> 01:44:35.010]
I don't know what it is.

[01:44:36.190 --> 01:44:37.830]
But I sure be willing to find out.

[01:44:38.230 --> 01:44:40.210]
I have a bad crush on Tracy Pond.

[01:44:41.550 --> 01:44:43.450]
Oh, and here's the section for you, Bird.

[01:44:43.670 --> 01:44:44.170]
Here's the good say.

[01:44:44.230 --> 01:44:45.930]
With all the little three-year-old kids in here.

[01:44:46.670 --> 01:44:48.330]
Here's Danny Pond's from Valerie.

[01:44:48.590 --> 01:44:51.730]
When I was in the fifth grade, these are all for you.

[01:44:51.970 --> 01:44:52.130]
Great.

[01:44:54.790 --> 01:45:00.630]
No, Martin Sheen isn't a psychotic.

[01:45:00.770 --> 01:45:01.250]
Is this kid?

[01:45:01.410 --> 01:45:01.730]
No way.

[01:45:01.730 --> 01:45:03.630]
He's like normal compared to Emilio.

[01:45:04.230 --> 01:45:04.650]
Am I right?

[01:45:05.650 --> 01:45:06.370]
Charlie Sheen.

[01:45:06.710 --> 01:45:07.010]
Oh, yeah.

[01:45:07.070 --> 01:45:07.810]
Who's that we heard today?

[01:45:07.810 --> 01:45:09.030]
He's getting married to or something?

[01:45:10.050 --> 01:45:10.710]
Pat Peterson.

[01:45:11.590 --> 01:45:12.990]
Let's take a call from Broward.

[01:45:13.050 --> 01:45:13.210]
Hello.

[01:45:14.130 --> 01:45:14.910]
Hello, Neil.

[01:45:15.130 --> 01:45:16.710]
That man that's on the air with you.

[01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:18.590]
Did he actually get paid for sitting there laughing?

[01:45:18.890 --> 01:45:21.410]
No, we try to pay him to get out of here, but he'd rather volunteer.

[01:45:21.690 --> 01:45:22.830]
He likes to do volunteer work.

[01:45:23.090 --> 01:45:25.470]
Well, the letter that you received this morning addressed.

[01:45:25.470 --> 01:45:27.030]
It was addressed to the right person.

[01:45:28.650 --> 01:45:30.090]
The laughing...what was it, Jack asked?

[01:45:30.310 --> 01:45:31.170]
Something like that, right?

[01:45:31.170 --> 01:45:32.750]
I think they were right on target.

[01:45:32.910 --> 01:45:33.210]
Great.

[01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:34.230]
Hi.

[01:45:34.610 --> 01:45:35.610]
Mm-hmm.

[01:45:36.610 --> 01:45:37.910]
One of your relatives, no doubt.

[01:45:37.990 --> 01:45:38.530]
Yeah, no doubt.

[01:45:38.950 --> 01:45:39.710]
Dave County, hello.

[01:45:40.110 --> 01:45:41.770]
That was an incredible call, wasn't it?

[01:45:41.810 --> 01:45:42.190]
Yeah, it was.

[01:45:42.790 --> 01:45:46.690]
Anyway, I want to congratulate you and Sam for a wonderful trill off.

[01:45:47.650 --> 01:45:48.850]
Yeah, that was quite a good idea.

[01:45:49.290 --> 01:45:49.730]
I'm totally enjoyable.

[01:45:50.070 --> 01:45:53.050]
I can't believe our winner surpassed the Guinness Book of Records.

[01:45:53.210 --> 01:45:53.310]
Yeah.

[01:45:53.790 --> 01:45:55.030]
New record right on the radio.

[01:45:55.150 --> 01:45:55.550]
Sure was.

[01:45:56.010 --> 01:45:58.090]
Yeah, he was great except for one thing, Neil.

[01:45:58.350 --> 01:45:58.690]
What's that?

[01:45:58.690 --> 01:46:01.390]
Left off of major portion of our population.

[01:46:01.990 --> 01:46:03.230]
Young Jewish men.

[01:46:04.390 --> 01:46:05.690]
Don't you think we should have a...

[01:46:06.550 --> 01:46:09.690]
Well, after the holidays, we don't want to do it now, because it would be deemed as being sacrilegious.

[01:46:10.410 --> 01:46:12.090]
And far be it for me to be sacrilegious.

[01:46:12.450 --> 01:46:15.130]
After the holidays, we're going to have the Great Hutzpah contest.

[01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:16.590]
Exactly what I was going to suggest.

[01:46:16.950 --> 01:46:18.430]
You know, where have we heard that idea?

[01:46:18.710 --> 01:46:19.610]
It's probably subliminal.

[01:46:19.690 --> 01:46:23.670]
He didn't really hear you say it earlier, but it just, you know, you're bounced off the wall.

[01:46:24.250 --> 01:46:26.570]
Yeah, the bird actually suggested that this morning.

[01:46:26.570 --> 01:46:29.990]
I think we can probably get a good 20 second hood spy out of it.

[01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:36.250]
Yeah, I wasn't going to do it when it was his idea, but now that a fairly rational assignment caller suggested it, why not go for it?

[01:46:36.330 --> 01:46:36.970]
What the heck?

[01:46:37.570 --> 01:46:39.290]
As they say, in Lauderdale, go for it.

[01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:39.730]
How are we ready?

[01:46:39.910 --> 01:46:42.190]
Don't you think Thursday would be the perfect day to do it?

[01:46:42.210 --> 01:46:42.750]
No, I don't.

[01:46:43.110 --> 01:46:43.110]

[01:46:43.490 --> 01:46:45.550]
And don't start getting our Jewish friends upset.

[01:46:46.230 --> 01:46:47.470]
I go, you're a friend.

[01:46:48.290 --> 01:46:49.590]
Let's go to...

[01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:50.770]
Brappord, hello.

[01:46:51.390 --> 01:46:51.650]
Gail?

[01:46:51.990 --> 01:46:52.190]
Yeah.

[01:46:52.410 --> 01:46:53.150]
What's with the voice?

[01:46:53.410 --> 01:46:54.150]
Put your mouth a little.

[01:46:54.370 --> 01:46:54.890]
Yeah, I know.

[01:46:54.890 --> 01:46:56.430]
Come on, how about them pirates?

[01:46:56.730 --> 01:46:57.430]
Yeah, that's good.

[01:46:58.190 --> 01:46:59.110]
He's one of the...

[01:46:59.110 --> 01:47:00.850]
He's only a few road and let it be or coming out on CD.

[01:47:01.310 --> 01:47:04.670]
This is one of those guys who was in boys in the band, I think.

[01:47:05.290 --> 01:47:08.230]
Yo, speaking of that, I saw this great bag like last night.

[01:47:08.330 --> 01:47:09.050]
Come on now, sir.

[01:47:09.210 --> 01:47:09.890]
Butch up a little.

[01:47:10.430 --> 01:47:11.150]
All the way to the corner?

[01:47:11.790 --> 01:47:12.270]
Yeah, I bet.

[01:47:12.690 --> 01:47:14.190]
Or how about all male erotic features?

[01:47:14.450 --> 01:47:15.850]
Listen, the hung and the rest list.

[01:47:16.510 --> 01:47:17.370]
You ever seen that?

[01:47:19.570 --> 01:47:20.670]
On the straight side.

[01:47:20.810 --> 01:47:24.090]
This is probably one of those guys that goes up for ice cream every hour on the hour.

[01:47:24.090 --> 01:47:26.390]
Speaking of that, are you in stand going up to E-Max tonight?

[01:47:26.490 --> 01:47:26.990]
You bet.

[01:47:27.570 --> 01:47:28.230]
About what time?

[01:47:28.510 --> 01:47:29.070]
Eight o'clock.

[01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:30.350]
You guys give out autograph?

[01:47:30.810 --> 01:47:31.030]
Yeah.

[01:47:31.370 --> 01:47:32.310]
You're going to bring the bird with you?

[01:47:32.390 --> 01:47:33.290]
Stan will give out on...

[01:47:33.290 --> 01:47:35.230]
No, we wouldn't bring him up there to pollute the neighborhood.

[01:47:35.230 --> 01:47:36.050]
Are you kidding me?

[01:47:36.250 --> 01:47:37.810]
How about bringing Jean Cashman along?

[01:47:38.030 --> 01:47:39.430]
Oh, come on, sir.

[01:47:39.550 --> 01:47:40.650]
Are you really that desperate?

[01:47:40.890 --> 01:47:41.890]
I switch it now and then.

[01:47:42.090 --> 01:47:44.270]
Oh, boy, switch it, I think is what you meant.

[01:47:45.470 --> 01:47:46.190]
Jean Cashman.

[01:47:47.570 --> 01:47:49.310]
What is it there?

[01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:50.690]
Are you in the girls that look like guys?

[01:47:51.230 --> 01:47:52.810]
Oh, Jean's that bad looking?

[01:47:52.810 --> 01:47:54.130]
G-E-N-E.

[01:47:55.830 --> 01:47:56.230]
Hardly.

[01:47:56.350 --> 01:47:56.750]
Just a joke.

[01:47:57.130 --> 01:47:58.590]
Stan, such a look like Stevie Neck.

[01:47:59.090 --> 01:48:00.350]
No, more like Stevie Wonder.

[01:48:00.630 --> 01:48:00.970]
Okay.

[01:48:01.450 --> 01:48:03.250]
Let me get a jump start on the foot of the contest.

[01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:03.790]
Are you ready?

[01:48:04.370 --> 01:48:05.350]
More like Steve Sacks.

[01:48:05.830 --> 01:48:06.110]
Come on.

[01:48:06.410 --> 01:48:08.210]
Let me get a jump start on the foot of the contest.

[01:48:08.250 --> 01:48:10.390]
No, we're not going to do this just for you today.

[01:48:10.530 --> 01:48:11.370]
What do you think this is?

[01:48:11.770 --> 01:48:13.570]
I can't give my version of who...

[01:48:13.570 --> 01:48:18.230]
This is almost Arrow of Russia, Shana, and you're starting to be Sack Religious, sir.

[01:48:18.690 --> 01:48:18.970]
Okay.

[01:48:19.230 --> 01:48:20.270]
Can I complain about Stan?

[01:48:20.530 --> 01:48:20.750]
Yes.

[01:48:20.750 --> 01:48:21.750]
He's sitting right here.

[01:48:21.890 --> 01:48:22.430]
Are you?

[01:48:23.070 --> 01:48:23.990]
Don't do it, sir.

[01:48:24.210 --> 01:48:24.650]
Don't do it.

[01:48:24.650 --> 01:48:26.090]
He's already in a surly mood.

[01:48:26.290 --> 01:48:26.750]
He's upset Monday.

[01:48:27.930 --> 01:48:29.870]
I just wanted to talk about reading the TV Guide.

[01:48:29.990 --> 01:48:32.530]
I called that phone number last night that turned out to be a guy.

[01:48:32.530 --> 01:48:33.310]
He's very upset.

[01:48:33.910 --> 01:48:36.570]
How about the reading TV Guide from Cover to Cover?

[01:48:36.890 --> 01:48:37.930]
That's going to be the show today.

[01:48:38.110 --> 01:48:39.430]
How about telling me what you do?

[01:48:39.630 --> 01:48:39.650]
Wow.

[01:48:39.650 --> 01:48:42.010]
How about telling me what you listen to in the afternoon, fellow?

[01:48:42.210 --> 01:48:43.890]
Steve Can, you like that excitement?

[01:48:44.510 --> 01:48:45.750]
You want to know the truth, Stan?

[01:48:45.930 --> 01:48:46.090]
Yeah.

[01:48:46.370 --> 01:48:49.290]
I listen to an hour of you and then I switch over to Alice.

[01:48:49.530 --> 01:48:50.250]
That's how bad it is.

[01:48:50.250 --> 01:48:51.270]
Oh my God.

[01:48:51.310 --> 01:48:52.490]
Well, believe me.

[01:48:52.490 --> 01:48:52.910]
Believe me.

[01:48:52.990 --> 01:48:54.630]
Let me tell you something, fellow.

[01:48:54.770 --> 01:48:58.130]
There are a couple of people who stick around and have a great time.

[01:48:58.390 --> 01:48:58.490]
Okay.

[01:48:58.570 --> 01:48:58.830]
Yeah.

[01:48:58.990 --> 01:49:00.270]
Try one or two of them.

[01:49:00.630 --> 01:49:00.890]
Yeah.

[01:49:01.210 --> 01:49:02.110]
And there's our lean.

[01:49:02.450 --> 01:49:02.770]
Yeah.

[01:49:03.230 --> 01:49:03.910]
Rintin' Ross.

[01:49:04.250 --> 01:49:05.310]
Well, you're Ferralis.

[01:49:05.730 --> 01:49:05.970]
Yeah.

[01:49:06.290 --> 01:49:06.630]
Okay.

[01:49:06.790 --> 01:49:08.170]
I hope you have a good life together, sir.

[01:49:09.010 --> 01:49:10.010]
Where's he surly cool?

[01:49:10.670 --> 01:49:11.090]
Ooh.

[01:49:11.090 --> 01:49:11.490]
Ooh, boy.

[01:49:11.550 --> 01:49:16.410]
Well, every time I turn the radio on to try to listen to your show, I only had one shot.

[01:49:16.730 --> 01:49:16.990]
You only had one shot.

[01:49:16.990 --> 01:49:17.950]
You only had one shot.

[01:49:17.950 --> 01:49:19.870]
I said, Sunny Fox even knocked me.

[01:49:19.950 --> 01:49:21.110]
Now, what have I ever done to Sunny Fox?

[01:49:21.110 --> 01:49:22.410]
Is Sunny Fox something about Stan?

[01:49:22.670 --> 01:49:22.790]
Yeah.

[01:49:22.790 --> 01:49:28.850]
Now, what the hell have I, I've let him on my show like four or five times since I came back to Miami.

[01:49:29.190 --> 01:49:29.930]
And that's what I've told you.

[01:49:30.670 --> 01:49:30.670]

[01:49:30.670 --> 01:49:31.490]
Why do you do that?

[01:49:31.730 --> 01:49:32.350]
Screw Sunny.

[01:49:32.970 --> 01:49:34.010]
Well, don't go that far.

[01:49:35.050 --> 01:49:37.370]
Boy, is he surly there while I told him?

[01:49:37.590 --> 01:49:38.370]
It can be a, it's come.

[01:49:38.370 --> 01:49:39.310]
I'm sick again.

[01:49:40.250 --> 01:49:43.970]
I'm still feeling that thing from, I told you.

[01:49:44.310 --> 01:49:45.270]
I still had it yesterday.

[01:49:45.710 --> 01:49:45.950]
God.

[01:49:47.030 --> 01:49:47.250]
Yeah.

[01:49:47.250 --> 01:49:48.850]
Well, that's the last dinner we're going to have.

[01:49:49.150 --> 01:49:50.090]
You know where?

[01:49:50.270 --> 01:49:50.630]
Wow.

[01:49:51.290 --> 01:49:52.910]
We had a real moving experience.

[01:49:57.690 --> 01:50:00.410]
You know, I'd rather it would hit me all at one time.

[01:50:00.510 --> 01:50:00.690]
Yeah.

[01:50:01.150 --> 01:50:01.970]
And get rid of it.

[01:50:01.970 --> 01:50:02.010]
Get rid of it.

[01:50:02.010 --> 01:50:02.470]
Yeah, over.

[01:50:02.610 --> 01:50:03.990]
You know, this is like three days.

[01:50:04.210 --> 01:50:04.370]
Yeah.

[01:50:04.850 --> 01:50:07.810]
Well, it comes in spurts.

[01:50:09.970 --> 01:50:12.570]
Okay, let's go to, we want, she'll be sick tonight.

[01:50:12.890 --> 01:50:14.570]
I guarantee it'll be sick tonight.

[01:50:14.570 --> 01:50:16.810]
And there's no way that I'm going up there alone.

[01:50:16.950 --> 01:50:17.750]
I don't blame you.

[01:50:17.870 --> 01:50:18.890]
I'm not going up there alone.

[01:50:19.230 --> 01:50:21.950]
So the question is, will you make the ultimate sacrifice?

[01:50:22.730 --> 01:50:24.190]
You don't even have to eat anything.

[01:50:26.930 --> 01:50:27.750]
He's not speaking.

[01:50:29.190 --> 01:50:29.810]
Yeah, I'll go.

[01:50:29.890 --> 01:50:31.370]
Because you're the only one that can go in there.

[01:50:31.430 --> 01:50:31.790]
You know me.

[01:50:31.870 --> 01:50:32.650]
I am so chicken.

[01:50:32.790 --> 01:50:33.470]
I'm not going to go in.

[01:50:33.850 --> 01:50:35.470]
Brian doesn't even know who I am.

[01:50:35.550 --> 01:50:36.210]
I'll go in.

[01:50:36.230 --> 01:50:38.430]
And every time that we keep threatening to go up there.

[01:50:38.770 --> 01:50:39.410]
I know that.

[01:50:40.050 --> 01:50:41.350]
What are you going to do if he's not there?

[01:50:41.770 --> 01:50:43.770]
If Brian is not working tonight,

[01:50:44.370 --> 01:50:46.470]
you'll never hear the name of that ice cream place.

[01:50:46.630 --> 01:50:47.370]
I'm serious.

[01:50:47.590 --> 01:50:48.670]
We'll go right to Larry's house.

[01:50:48.810 --> 01:50:50.390]
Yeah, we'll start promoting a new place.

[01:50:51.070 --> 01:50:52.250]
I mean, I don't want to get surly,

[01:50:52.310 --> 01:50:54.710]
but that's who's that is giving us so much bad information.

[01:50:57.050 --> 01:50:58.270]
He's giving us a lot of crate.

[01:51:00.250 --> 01:51:00.790]
Who's that?

[01:51:02.590 --> 01:51:03.610]
Dave Coyde, hello.

[01:51:03.930 --> 01:51:04.590]
Hello, you are.

[01:51:04.710 --> 01:51:05.690]
How you making fun of your couple?

[01:51:05.790 --> 01:51:06.470]
Oh, Brian.

[01:51:06.690 --> 01:51:08.350]
How's the other four kids, Brian?

[01:51:08.530 --> 01:51:09.330]
How did call there?

[01:51:09.670 --> 01:51:11.390]
I got very upset you make it fun of me.

[01:51:11.530 --> 01:51:11.970]
I missed you.

[01:51:11.970 --> 01:51:12.570]
And I missed you.

[01:51:13.530 --> 01:51:14.250]
I missed you.

[01:51:14.250 --> 01:51:14.790]
Brian, come on, Brian.

[01:51:14.950 --> 01:51:15.910]
Put you up a little, baby.

[01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:17.150]
Okay.

[01:51:17.990 --> 01:51:18.590]
Bye-bye.

[01:51:19.350 --> 01:51:22.030]
I heard that Sunny Coyde had a couple of minutes of yards.

[01:51:22.150 --> 01:51:22.310]
Great.

[01:51:22.510 --> 01:51:23.570]
Was that incredible or what?

[01:51:23.610 --> 01:51:24.850]
Then he took a shot at Stan.

[01:51:25.030 --> 01:51:26.330]
I did take a shot at Stan.

[01:51:26.490 --> 01:51:27.930]
You know, these Zephyn jocks.

[01:51:28.390 --> 01:51:29.770]
Who needs Sunny anyway?

[01:51:29.910 --> 01:51:30.310]
He's a jerk.

[01:51:30.570 --> 01:51:32.750]
Like that Joey took a shot at me the other day again.

[01:51:32.750 --> 01:51:33.750]
You know, he just can't resist.

[01:51:34.070 --> 01:51:34.950]
Mr. Bean himself.

[01:51:35.230 --> 01:51:36.170]
Yeah, Mr. Hasley.

[01:51:36.170 --> 01:51:38.970]
I knew it was a big chronic caller for Sandy Schulte

[01:51:38.970 --> 01:51:41.510]
when she was doing those TV repairmen.

[01:51:41.870 --> 01:51:42.510]
And I asked her,

[01:51:42.590 --> 01:51:44.650]
do all these voices come naturally or what?

[01:51:44.810 --> 01:51:46.750]
I mean, boy, this is so bad that it's frightening.

[01:51:47.230 --> 01:51:48.290]
Oh, not a lot.

[01:51:48.670 --> 01:51:48.990]
I thought that one.

[01:51:50.430 --> 01:51:54.090]
I think this caller is from the Emilio Estevez School of Life.

[01:51:54.350 --> 01:51:55.990]
If you ask me, I mean, really, a manic.

[01:51:57.210 --> 01:51:58.650]
You watch manic, by the way?

[01:51:58.750 --> 01:51:59.530]
One of my favorite shows.

[01:51:59.690 --> 01:52:00.490]
Okay, well, listen, Sarah,

[01:52:00.530 --> 01:52:03.090]
a great weekend because before you know it, it'll be here.

[01:52:03.850 --> 01:52:07.430]
Boy, this has been an experience.

[01:52:08.230 --> 01:52:09.990]
I can't believe I survived it.

[01:52:11.310 --> 01:52:13.090]
I won't congratulate you again.

[01:52:14.010 --> 01:52:14.570]
Please don't.

[01:52:14.710 --> 01:52:15.870]
For surviving the four hours.

[01:52:16.010 --> 01:52:16.370]
Please don't.

[01:52:16.430 --> 01:52:17.690]
Why don't you just take a little soldier

[01:52:17.690 --> 01:52:19.070]
and up to the other end of the building?

[01:52:19.390 --> 01:52:20.070]
And have a wonderful life.

[01:52:20.710 --> 01:52:21.630]
Okay, well, that's going to do it.

[01:52:21.630 --> 01:52:22.890]
And of course tonight around eight o'clock,

[01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:24.850]
probably some of our royalty,

[01:52:25.010 --> 01:52:26.670]
the Royal Family from the El Roger Show,

[01:52:26.850 --> 01:52:28.490]
be gathering around the ice cream joint,

[01:52:28.990 --> 01:52:31.430]
some of our kings and princes and princesses

[01:52:31.970 --> 01:52:35.010]
and all the rest of the Royal Family

[01:52:35.010 --> 01:52:35.930]
with their crowns on.

[01:52:36.430 --> 01:52:37.670]
And you know what I said,

[01:52:38.230 --> 01:52:40.110]
some of our friends had better be there working

[01:52:40.110 --> 01:52:41.410]
and I'm going to have a lot of ice cream.

[01:52:41.550 --> 01:52:42.770]
Might even get a big banana split,

[01:52:42.770 --> 01:52:43.930]
just an honor of the occasion.

[01:52:44.430 --> 01:52:46.370]
Stay tuned out for staying because it sounds like

[01:52:46.370 --> 01:52:47.990]
he is in a great mood.

[01:52:47.990 --> 01:52:48.170]
Oh, yeah.

[01:52:48.170 --> 01:52:49.510]
It ought to be a four-houries.

[01:52:49.550 --> 01:52:51.130]
And we'll go down in history.

[01:52:54.570 --> 01:52:56.650]
You've been listening to the new Roger Show.
