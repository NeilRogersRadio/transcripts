[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400]
Talk about it at the water cooler and that's what we all strive for every day.

[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.060]
You know, I know Tanner can relate to this.

[00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.300]
You go try to get people to talk about your radio station after 10 o'clock in the morning.

[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.120]
Hey Rosita, I have to go shopping downtown for my mother.

[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.020]
She needs some tortillas and chili pepper.

[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.220]
What happened to that tape? You hear that?

[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.940]
It's unbelievable. It's self-destructing at the beginning of the show.

[00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.320]
That could be a real almond folks.

[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.380]
That could be a real almond. It does sound a lot better that way.

[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.820]
It adds a little bit of flavor to it, like a little salsa to the sound of that tape.

[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.860]
Anyway, it's a 10-07 or 8 or whatever it is here at WINZ.

[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.040]
I'm Neil Rogers and every day we go through this incredible exercise.

[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:56.220]
This great trauma from 10 to 2 and then Stan Major comes a log and kind of cleans up the mess from 2 to 6.

[00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.120]
Or makes his own mess, I guess is the way you'd put it.

[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.040]
Well, ratings are going to be out sometime in this next hour, right?

[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.140]
Boy, that's exciting. Everybody in the building is kind of sitting on eggs.

[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.360]
In fact, there are a couple of people in the building laying some eggs right now even as we speak.

[00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.880]
And our new slogan here at WINZ this week is Mess With Success.

[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.740]
You remember dress for success? Well, we have a new one. It's called Mess With Success.

[00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.500]
But we won't get into that until the book comes out.

[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.140]
Okay, now speaking of books, I have The New York Times magazine in my hand and now that it's Tuesday.

[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.520]
We had Fred Chantz here yesterday and I think we had a pretty good show, especially since we didn't take any calls.

[00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.280]
And I think Fred gave out a lot of good information.

[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.720]
Unfortunately, I'm not all that convinced that most people are going to pay any attention,

[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.040]
but even if a few of them do, and they can benefit from it, then it's worthwhile.

[00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.200]
But on this show, unlike all the other shows in town, we haven't really had a chance to talk about this outrageous.

[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.280]
I heard a woman calling up Stan yesterday. I'd like to beat her with a stick.

[00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.640]
She was going on about how everybody got a right to letter to The New York Times and right

[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.980]
letters to their advertisers and I really let them have it. Let them have it for what?

[00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.360]
For telling the truth and kind of a milked over a way?

[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.360]
I mean, this article is so much to do about nothing and the only reason I'm bringing it up is because

[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.980]
I want to make that point again.

[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.080]
Can Miami save itself? A city be set by drugs and violence by Robert Sherrill?

[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.820]
And if you read the article as I did on Sunday morning, you find out that it's,

[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.100]
it's number one, 99 percent accurate and number two, it's no big deal.

[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.060]
It's no big deal. It basically is true. It's a pretty accurate reflection of the way this town

[00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.420]
has been turned into a cesspool. And if there's anybody in this audience, whether they're one of the,

[00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.540]
you know, Chamber of Commerce types, the Beacon Council or the non-group or any of these other

[00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.860]
self-appointed mavens who wants to refute it, man, you ought to be ashamed of yourselves.

[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.880]
And instead of constantly refuting it, why don't these people come up with some answers?

[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.400]
And the bottom line, of course, is that none of them have any answers.

[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.300]
They have nothing positive to contribute to this community. And I want to come to chasing away

[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.180]
the kids in Fort Lauderdale on spring break, politicians in Fort Lauderdale in a

[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.880]
Broward County did a magnificent job on that. When it comes to dividing the community and constantly

[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.020]
doing the ethnic thing and getting all the ethnic tensions built up over and over again,

[00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.960]
people like George Valdez and others have a tremendous ability to do that

[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.780]
and to keep the fires burning. And when it comes to a total inability to

[00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.100]
prosecute major drug dealers and certainly the date-state attorney, who remains, by the way,

[00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.940]
incredibly popular. Everybody loves Janet Reno. She never got anybody convicted, you know,

[00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.800]
unless maybe they were a pickpocket, but everybody loves Janet Reno.

[00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.820]
And then, of course, we have that cowboy of a police chief in the city of Miami,

[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.940]
Clarence Dixon. And in a city that's overrun with cocaine cowboys, I guess it's appropriate

[00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.100]
that we have a cowboy as the chief of police in the city of Miami on the Anderthal.

[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.140]
Who, by the way, is very thin-skinned. He is not only dark-skinned, he is thin-skinned.

[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.760]
Because, and I'm sure that today, somewhere in this building, there will be a phone call from

[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.260]
his office. We want a tape of what did he say about Chief Dixon? Nothing that I haven't said before,

[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:24.740]
that he is a cowboy and that he's an Anderthal and a total disaster. The city of Miami,

[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.580]
and Dade County in general is so overrun by drugs as to be just unbelievable. I mean, it's everywhere,

[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.360]
these barbarians, these animals, these subhumans are out there peddling, not just crack,

[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:42.300]
but every kind. It's like a supermarket everywhere. And we're supposed to be upset.

[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.300]
I mean, even a moron like Charlie Whitehead could see through this in a herald.

[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:57.820]
On Saturday. And Mike Spindell was kind enough in his own juvenile way.

[00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.760]
Mike was kind enough to leave me the Whitehead column because I don't get the herald.

[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.120]
I know that's hard for some of you to believe I don't get the herald. I get the New York Times

[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.940]
and the Sun Sentinel. Why? I get the Sun Sentinel. I have no idea because it's not a real

[00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.180]
newspaper. A lot of ads in it. If you like to read the ads, man, the Sun Sentinels for you.

[00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.020]
And it's kind of interesting. The Sun Sentinel continuing the ponder to Palm Beach County.

[00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:27.160]
It's really like a Palm Beach newspaper. And like maybe if you live in the northernmost

[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.200]
two or three miles of Broward, you might find something that relates to you in your life.

[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.240]
But for example, all of this business about the New York Times, if there is anything or has

[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.820]
been anything about this whole business in the Sun Sentinel, then it's been very well buried.

[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.480]
And I just don't go through it all that much because there's nothing to read in it except ads.

[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:53.240]
Here comes our first message of the morning. They have a new building beside I-95

[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.940]
in Del Rey, who the Sun Sentinel. Oh sure, pretty soon they'll be in Jacksonville.

[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.360]
I mean, the Sun Sentinel is doing very well, but they could do so much better

[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:10.160]
if they would put something in the paper that related to most of us who live in Broward County.

[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.880]
And to those, you know, two million people live in Dade County. But they just don't want to do that.

[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.740]
They for some morbid reason, they continue to want to be a primarily Palm Beach County

[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:28.160]
Northern Broward newspaper in that order. And of course, this article brings up all the business

[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.940]
again about bilingualism. And I hear all these discussions on radio shows again, the same stuff we've

[00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.820]
heard over and over and over again. And you folks can continue beating that into the ground from

[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.280]
not to the end of time. And I'm telling you, it's not going to change because you have this segment of

[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.820]
people here who are rude and arrogant and obnoxious and who think that they've taken the thing over.

[00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.860]
And, you know, in some cases, there are those of us who believe that they have certain parts of the

[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.400]
area. And they don't give it to them about, you know, they're not going to hire people who aren't

[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.820]
their own people and they don't want to talk to people who don't want to speak their language. And

[00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:07.980]
that's it. Period. It's not debatable. It is rude and obnoxious and disgusting and you cannot

[00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:14.020]
legislate civility. You can't pass a law that says that people have to be civil to each other.

[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:20.020]
You can pass all the laws in the world that one doctor out there who's made himself a real

[00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.680]
chronic regular caller, the one who always happens to mention that he would love to send whichever

[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:31.740]
host he's talking to his English-only petitions or whatever they call it, new campaign. What a pain

[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:42.900]
in the ass he is, isn't he? Unbelievable. Is there anybody who learned anything? I don't know why

[00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:49.920]
I'm asking that question because obviously Joe sold 350 copies, which is all they had. All of the

[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:54.600]
copies sold out and they're probably a relative handful of people in South Florida who's subscribed

[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.780]
to the times like I do. So, you know, when you come right down to it, how many people potentially

[00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:03.620]
have even read this thing? It's interesting to me that everybody in his brother, it's like noses,

[00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:08.500]
everybody's got one. And that's how opinions are. Everybody's got an opinion on this, but most everybody

[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:15.440]
has it read it. Just like Sergio Pereira who had an immediate opinion on it before he even read it.

[00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:22.840]
And on all the shows, even on this one, we were referring to it because it became a big cause

[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:29.640]
celebs. And isn't it amazing how former Mayor Fere is making all of these very frank comments in

[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:36.120]
this article which he never would have made while he was still the mayor? I'm not going to even

[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:39.280]
bother to take the time to quote from them, but there are certainly things that he never would have

[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.980]
said when he was the mayor. When he was mayor, he was busy saying brilliant things like well, the

[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.820]
economy around the rest of the country is really in desperate straits, but in Miami, we don't worry

[00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:52.740]
about that because we've got all of the money in our banks. Ha ha ha, like big joke. You know,

[00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:56.940]
people are dying from drugs on the streets and people are blowing each other away and people are

[00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:01.180]
fleeing like crazy from all of this, but ha ha ha, all our banks are full of drug money.

[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:07.780]
See, it's people like Maurice Fere, it's Neanderthal's morons like that who have helped us to get

[00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:13.140]
to the point that we're at today. And now when something like this comes out, these same morons all

[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:18.260]
raise their arms in dismay and the beacon council and the chamber of commerce and all these other

[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:23.580]
leaders, self-appointed leaders. We're going to do something about this man. We're going to write a

[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:32.800]
letter to the editor, dammit, of the damn New York Times. How do you like that? Put that in your

[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:39.080]
pipe, put that in your bong and smoke it. Put that in your beer can and smoke it.

[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.980]
And then of course the pictures in here and everybody makes a big deal. See, the herald

[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:51.360]
manipulates the public even even to this day. They still manipulate a good segment of the public

[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:57.640]
and the herald, as Mike pointed out very accurately the other day, the herald has errors and pictures

[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:01.380]
all the time. There's hardly a day that goes by that you won't find a little retraction or

[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:05.420]
correction somewhere in the newspaper about the wrong name on a picture or something that was a

[00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:10.300]
mistake. And I grant you this is a big picture, but nonetheless, who cares about that? Is that why

[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:14.480]
people really bought the magazine to see that there was a picture in here that was only staged and

[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:20.240]
it wasn't for real? What difference does it make? I mean, it's still part of the reality of what

[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:26.000]
this town is all about. And this town is going to hell in a hand basket and you drive around different

[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.180]
sections of town and basically all we have left now are like the kindle's not so great either

[00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:37.760]
anymore. Trust me, Kendall is a crime ridden Spanish speaking town basically, which is why I moved

[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:46.080]
out of there years ago. I can't believe it. If you could see what I'm looking at right now, we have

[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:53.120]
the Zeta Sync. I cannot believe that with a little hole in the bottom. Well, I tell you, you better

[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:58.220]
get that thing ready. I'm talking about the hole in the bottom. You better get that thing ready. I

[00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:03.400]
think that Portableca be used as a Portajon. And it's got its own little sync to kind of wash all the

[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:10.940]
evil away. Zeta 94.9 on the sync. Isn't that great? Where's that going to go? Okay, I'm going to

[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:15.220]
restrain myself because I got some ideas where it could go, but that's another story for another

[00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:23.920]
day. Excuse me for the distraction, but I was so overwhelmed by that. That is cute. Now, see,

[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:28.360]
here on the AM, we don't have that. We don't have syncs with our insignia. We don't have any of the

[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:34.400]
good stuff on the AM. We've got all the numbers and we got most of the revenue, but we'd listen,

[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:39.200]
we're like the peons, we're like the lost children. We're still waiting for Moses to come and lead us

[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:45.720]
out of the desert, out of the bowels of the building. But anyway, I'm sure that there are lots of

[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:51.000]
people in this audience. I'm just positive. There are lots of people who've got all kinds of things

[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.220]
to say about the New York Times article and all a reaction to it, even though most of you haven't

[00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:03.360]
read it, that's okay. Don't let that stand in your way. Okay? Never. It's just like Admiral Point

[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:10.420]
Dexter don't ever let the truth stand in your way. I mean, if your memory gets bad, hey, we understand.

[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:18.680]
That seems to be very popular in Washington last the what, 15, 20 years. People have bad memories as

[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:23.080]
we get older. Our memories start to fade. We can't remember what we shredded yesterday.

[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:30.140]
Much less today. And certainly much less six months a year ago.

[00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:34.300]
Do you think we're going to get response on the New York Times article?

[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:43.380]
You're withholding judgment. Okay. Hey, listen, you're going to be surprised because everybody

[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:47.240]
wants to say all those same things all over again that they've been saying for the last to six,

[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:52.380]
seven years now. They come to America, they ought to speak English. And when they come to my country,

[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:57.480]
they, you know, and I don't disagree with that, you know, I don't disagree with it. And I said

[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.860]
the other day and it's amazing that nobody commented on it. I guess maybe it was a blessing that

[00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:05.960]
nobody commented on it, but all of this crap about how if the Cubans hadn't come here in the early

[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:12.220]
60s, Miami would be nothing. That's a lot of garbage. Miami would have evolved like most other,

[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:19.700]
like a lot of other American cities. Miami might be like Houston or like Atlanta or a lot of

[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:24.320]
other southern American cities or maybe even like San Diego with a better climate.

[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.880]
But Sergio Pereira, you're right, better still not be discriminating against Cubans. He better

[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:36.900]
hire a lot more Hispanics in Dade County. Did you see that in the herald the other day?

[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:41.700]
We're not hiring enough Hispanics. Big headline on the local section. Now, and of course,

[00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:46.620]
who are they kidding over there? I mean, they're so desperate. They're running around. They're just

[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:50.000]
going through the phone book, finding Hispanic surnames and calling those people up.

[00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:57.760]
Begging them to subscribe. Even if it's only for a week, just to goose up the circulation numbers.

[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:04.840]
Okay, let's give our numbers out and see if we can't just kill a little bit of time here today.

[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:10.320]
How do you like that? That moron George Valdez is going to bring that crap up again today at the

[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:14.480]
Metro Commission meeting. Look at the response on the phone here today. How's this good? I told you,

[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:19.740]
I felt it. The minute I sat down here. Now in about 30 seconds, what I'm really going to do is

[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:24.280]
pick up the magazine and rip up the New York Times magazine. I can't throw it in the waste basket

[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:28.320]
and assume that there is nobody in the audience who has anything to say about it, which is fine with

[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:38.380]
me. I'll just go home. I'm ready to go home. No problem. Because if I sit here long enough, I might

[00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:42.560]
say what I originally intended to come in here and say this morning anyway, which you would have

[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:53.740]
really enjoyed. Mess with success. I'm going to give the numbers one more time.

[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:58.720]
And if we don't really see anything going on here today, I'm just going to take the day off.

[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:03.960]
I can be out there. Doesn't Flagler have a matinee on Tuesday? Sure they do. I can be out at Flagler

[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:09.060]
by 1230. No problem at all. I can stop. Have a good breakfast beforehand. Go to Flagler.

[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:16.560]
Plunge my brains out. I see Kyle screaming into the phone just shouting and yelling and

[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:23.100]
carrying on like a banshee. But that's this market, man. That's what this town is all about. That's

[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:26.300]
another thing that he doesn't. First of all, the article really doesn't say anything about the

[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:32.060]
market as a whole. That's with the W. Said nothing about it as a whole. It's like, I mentioned

[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:37.040]
this the other day. It's like Miami is the whole area and like all the rest of us are non-existent.

[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:43.500]
And of course, sometimes you feel that way. But it doesn't give you anything of the flavor

[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:47.980]
of how anti-social it is here. The people aren't friendly. They're not outgoing. They don't

[00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.280]
want to talk to each other. They don't want to talk to you when you're on the air.

[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:58.800]
And after we're 11 and a half years, it gets old to come in every day. I ought to be able to come

[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.360]
in here and sit down and say, hi, how you doing? And every line on the board should light up. Not

[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:07.280]
because it's me, but just because that's the way it should be. That's the way it isn't a lot of places.

[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:15.020]
But the people here are just hard to get to. Man, they're just hard to reach.

[00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:20.820]
Like I've said so many times before, this is a tough town. A real tough town.

[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.760]
And I don't know why we're waiting for those ratings to come out anyway, because you could have

[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:33.520]
an 80-year here. I've told you this before. It means nothing, zero, nada, nothing.

[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:41.400]
And I spent almost an hour this morning telling our management that it doesn't mean anything,

[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:48.580]
nothing, zero. We could have, how do you like this? We could have a 100-year, in other words,

[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:55.140]
every person who has a radio and is listening to it in this area could be listening to this show.

[00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:59.500]
And it wouldn't mean anything. Tom, to bring back that Zeta Sync, would you please? I'm going to

[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:03.160]
jump in a sink and just, you know, wash myself down the hall. That's it.

[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:12.960]
Lauderdale, hello. Hello, Neil. I'll wait some time with you. I read most of the article that was

[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:19.460]
in the New York Times on Sunday, but I read it in the Sun Sentinel. They reprinted it in most part

[00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:23.720]
with permission from the New York Times. It wasn't that nice. I mean, there was really something to

[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:28.020]
read in the Sun Sentinel for a change. Of course, you know, it's easy to reprint something, isn't it?

[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:32.320]
Yeah, well it is, but it was in the Sun Sentinel and you see, I couldn't get the New York Times because

[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:39.120]
my new stand had it sold out by 8 o'clock in the morning, and I got there at 8.30. But I think

[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:45.720]
Miami or that the city fathers and date and Miami overreacted, I have read articles knocking New

[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:51.100]
York City and telling it like it is about that, and Los Angeles and San Francisco. And this was

[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:57.960]
no great stuff. This was telling the truth and these guys are going, the crying is, oh my god,

[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:03.300]
we can't do this anymore. I want to tell you something. This article was a superficial piece of

[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:08.580]
garbage. It was such an understatement of what's going on here that if anything, Cheryl ought to be

[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:14.200]
criticized not for knocking, but for really, he went over backward when that woman called Stan

[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:17.800]
yesterday and said that he didn't mention anything that was positive. She obviously didn't even read

[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:24.040]
the article because he went on and on and on about the new basketball team and the new Symphony,

[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:28.260]
which is in the works and the this and that. And then the last part of the article, which I'm going

[00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:32.940]
to turn to, the last several paragraphs, he keeps quoting all of these different self-verklinged

[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:37.400]
like Amitch Maidique over at FIU, who also I wonder if he's ever going to learn to speak English.

[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:43.180]
He goes on about the growing the Karagwan community and all the new entrepreneurs and

[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:49.120]
about the business community is going to develop such in such a way and the University of Miami

[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:55.860]
raised all of this money. So really when you read the whole thing and on balance, it is so positive

[00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.820]
compared to what the reality of the community is that it's almost like a blue sky.

[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:05.520]
I read the old article of Paradise Lost in Time Magazine when it first came out, I guess it was about

[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:14.220]
45 years ago. No, 1981. Six years ago. Yeah. And that was a lot more negative than this article.

[00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:17.700]
It was also accurate. There was nothing in that article that was inaccurate.

[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:23.580]
No, there wasn't any, but that was Time Magazine and it had time to study and do a good

[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:29.780]
investigative reporting job. The newspaper Cheryl used to be down here. He lives right at up in

[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:35.000]
Tallahassee and he's doing something from a long distance and the people down here in Miami

[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:42.960]
didn't read the paper. They just listened to Pereira and Suarez or whatever the heck his name is.

[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:51.460]
All these people complaining about what the Times article had said and not listening to or not

[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:58.320]
reading and forming their own opinions on it. These people, I don't think there's any hope left

[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:05.100]
for any of these people down here in South Florida because they're just walking dead and it upsets

[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:10.740]
me. And I can see it happening in Broward County now too. It's already died in

[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:16.060]
fade and now it's still throwing up the Broward with their kicking out the kids during spring

[00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:22.960]
break, spring break, which was the only thing that kept the hotels going. The diplomat is going

[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:30.940]
belly up. The EMR on the beach is offering $43 a night and stay six night and get one free because

[00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:37.020]
they can't get anybody to come down here anymore. People are afraid too. There's nothing to do. They're

[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:43.740]
upset and this article really didn't say much about that at all. How most of South Florida now

[00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:48.740]
is just falling into the ocean. Have a wonderful day. Bye.

[00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:56.260]
Almost, it's almost like I invited a call from Bob Lassiter today. Isn't it 1030 at W.I.N.Z.

[00:20:56.340 --> 00:21:00.600]
No, I'm not knocking the caller because I mean he was getting it off his chest and I invite people

[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:06.240]
to do that. It's frustrating. And those people who knock me for a Miami bashing and knocking the

[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:12.500]
area shame on you. Boy, the way this area is deteriorated since I've come here and long before

[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:19.800]
that it started is enough to make you want to cry. And if somebody has the, well really,

[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:23.900]
I mean the guy was commissioned to write the article. He's a freelance writer so I'm not going to

[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:28.300]
give him a tremendous amount of credit. But nonetheless if somebody is honest and tells it like it is

[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:32.660]
or even tells a little slice of what's going on here, right away let's attack the messenger man

[00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:39.140]
because we don't like the story. We don't like the message. We have an open line in Broward,

[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:46.540]
right? 5249400 in Broward, home of the brain dead, Kendall, good morning. Good morning.

[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:53.640]
I have a couple of things, Fady. First of all I'm a Miami native. But that doesn't change the fact

[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:59.380]
that I've seen the deterioration here. How long have you been here? I've been back just over two

[00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:06.200]
years. I left just after the riots. I had a dinner party and one of my friends brought a bottle of wine

[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:12.040]
and another one brought a gun and I said, well, is that how you feel, Fave? It's time to leave this

[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:17.400]
town. But I wanted to say I went to Colorado because I'd heard so much about the frontier mentality

[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:22.900]
and how people were warmer. And it's a bunch of superficial nonsense. It's no different. Wait a

[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:27.380]
minute. You had to go to Colorado for a frontier mentality. Well, I thought I would go. We have a

[00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:35.760]
frontier mentality here. No, different than Miami. Somewhere less, less decadent. For lack of a better

[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:43.840]
word, I went out west as it were. And I found that that unity, it's not different anywhere.

[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:48.820]
There's there's hostilities there. There's there's interracial problems there. They're

[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:54.540]
worried about Mexicans here. They're worried about Cubans. But when I moved back, I moved from Miami

[00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:58.520]
to Kendall and then I heard you saying, well, you said about Kendall, I almost cried. I just got here.

[00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:03.980]
I thought it was going to be better here. Oh, good luck to you. But I walked into a restaurant the

[00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:09.040]
other day and I went up and I asked them in Spanish if they spoke English because I could tell

[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:14.420]
it was predominantly Spanish. And they said, nope, I had to fake it with my limited Spanish.

[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:19.100]
It didn't speak any English at all. Yeah, Kendall will be the next, you know, see we had Miami and

[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:24.620]
Hylia and Sweetwater. And Kendall is, well, if I say will be, probably we already could include it.

[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:29.280]
I mean, there are some people who speak English. But when you go into the convenience stores and

[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:33.120]
even some of the other establishments now, and even some of the stores in daylight and years ago,

[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:37.540]
I mean, it's nothing new. You go in and they approach you in Spanish. So Kendall is the next

[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:44.200]
lost community. Back when the May fair first opened and they were hiring, I remember seeing the

[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:49.200]
ads in the paper and they would not hire unless you were buying more. So Spanish had become a

[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:54.240]
requirement even back then. Yeah, that's terrific. But I, one thing I want to say in our

[00:23:54.240 --> 00:24:00.680]
favor is that I found, when I first moved back here, I lived in Boca for a while. And I think that

[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:06.400]
to Miami's credit as horrible as it can be, the communities that don't have all the stress and all

[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:11.820]
the interracial mixes are so white bread, Neil. I mean, I couldn't even find a good restaurant to eat

[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:17.940]
and I'm a gourmet food addict. So I have to say that, oh, that reminds me, I was listening to

[00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:22.460]
you Saturday morning. And I heard somebody call and talk about a new restaurant in Coral Gables.

[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:29.880]
I think it was called 276. Yeah. It's over on Alhambra Cirque. I don't know me. I think it was called.

[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:35.760]
I went in there myself and then I was listening to you Saturday and I must tell you that it's fabulous.

[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:42.060]
It's a fabulous new place. You have to try it. The food is really unique. It's a tiny little place.

[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:47.160]
But it's really warm and the food is really different and I just, I have any insight in

[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:50.920]
this place in a long time. Great. Now, but I want to go back to what you said. I'm a little confused.

[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.260]
I don't want to misunderstand you about good restaurant. What kind of communities did you say that

[00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:01.240]
where you can't find good restaurants? In Boca, in Boca, in Boca, everything is so.

[00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:07.200]
Oh, that's ridiculous. Oh, I don't think there were two nice places in Boca. There was there was

[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:14.040]
Lovey Mesa and there was another time in place, Raphael O. You had to go either up to Palm Beach

[00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:18.760]
or go out to Fort Lauderdale. They're really out of here. Now, let me, let me make a point for you.

[00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:24.080]
Okay. When I lived in Detroit, downtown Detroit was a sewer. It is still a sewer even with all the

[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:28.780]
renovation. It's still a sewer, but there was something to go there for. There was the London

[00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:32.820]
Chop House and there were a lot of other fine. There was Carl's and there were a lot of other fine

[00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:37.840]
restaurants in downtown Detroit, even Coney Island hot dog joints. I mean, there were all kinds of

[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:42.320]
places to go. Now, where do you go when you go to eat in downtown Miami? Over there used to be

[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:47.100]
place. I'm not talking about base. I'm not talking about base side because base side is like, you know,

[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:51.980]
it's like a shopping center, but I'm talking about downtown Miami. When you go there, where's the

[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:58.920]
more of the fine eating establishments? I don't know anymore because I've just gotten back and the

[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:03.580]
fear that I asked my friends about that used to be there like Tulio and Andres and those little

[00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:07.680]
places that were hidden away are gone. Yeah. That, you know, they couldn't stand it anymore.

[00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:16.220]
Even what's his name? The Northern Italian guy, um, Romando. He moved. So I guess you're right on

[00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:22.160]
that count, but it's just it's an aura that I was really it's the attitude. Um, maybe it's because

[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:28.140]
I grew up in Miami and I'm used to the ethnic mix and I like a little bit of of the differences

[00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:33.880]
that when there's a difference between an ethnic mix and feeling alienated and being in a foreign

[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:39.160]
country. Absolutely. I'm sorry. I can't explain it. I guess it's not a cultural mix. It is a foreign

[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:45.900]
country. Period. I can't disagree with that because I'm confused about the issue myself. I don't

[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:51.940]
think that it's fair to mandate that we be bilingual. I do agree with the people that say if

[00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:55.480]
you're going to live in our country, you have an obligation to at least attempt to speak the

[00:26:55.480 --> 00:27:02.000]
language in public. I agree that you're with you that it's rude and crude and it's disgusting. It

[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:09.080]
is vulgar. It is obnoxious. It's one of the most to use one's language as a weapon as a divisive

[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:14.160]
force to beat other people over the head with to isolate yourselves with and to bring

[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:18.260]
scorn upon yourselves and then to turn around and say, oh, big it, big it. Well, what the hell do

[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:23.220]
people expect when they behave in such a way that says very clearly we don't want to assimilate.

[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:27.280]
We don't want to be part of your damn culture. We're going to do our own thing. We're going to take

[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:31.880]
over. We're going to hire our own people. We're going to have our own thing. And if you don't like it,

[00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:36.060]
you can get the hell out. And we're going to do it in your country with the benefits that your

[00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:40.920]
society provides. Exactly. With all the benefits you gave us with all those cheap low interest loans,

[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:45.960]
with all the help that you gave them. Are you with the food stamps and the welfare of your and

[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:50.720]
my tax dollars. We have people turning around and spitting in our face. And that's why there are so

[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:55.640]
many people leaving a date county. And that's why there's so much divisiveness in this town. And

[00:27:55.640 --> 00:28:00.840]
here we, you know, we just had that promo on a few minutes ago. Here George Valdez again today

[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:05.760]
is going to bring up the attempt to repeal the anti-bilingual ordinance. So we can open up all

[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:10.500]
those wounds again and we can everybody fighting with each other and bring back all the old hatreds

[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:15.760]
again. Isn't that just what we need? Perfect. It's perfect. But on my run about the New York Times

[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:21.580]
article, I admit I didn't read it. So I'll open myself up for that criticism. But the news did

[00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:27.220]
say that most of the negatives that they stated were from the riot period in the 80s. Was that

[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:31.920]
a... Oh, nonsense. That's a lot of baloney. What they talked about was an understatement of exactly

[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:38.520]
what's going on here today. This is not a rehash. This isn't something that, you know, again, as I said,

[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:44.080]
it just warmed over because there's nothing new in here. But in terms of what's really going on now,

[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:49.220]
it's accurate. For example, it talks about the survey that was taken by Lewis Harris last

[00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:55.260]
spring. When they asked all the CEOs all over the country to rank 30 metropolitan areas in terms

[00:28:55.260 --> 00:29:01.160]
of desirability, Miami came in 28th out of 30. Okay? And it talks about the reasons why they felt

[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:06.540]
that way about the crime and the drugs and all the other things and about housing prices and how

[00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:13.160]
they declined and so on. It's up to date. This is not a rehash of 1981. That's just an excuse by

[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:17.220]
those people who would try to say, oh, this is all ancient history. We've made a comeback. Everything's

[00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:22.020]
wonderful now. Right. Everything's great. And I'm going to say to you again, if you believe these

[00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:27.080]
people that everything's wonderful, you'll get in your automobile and go down to South Point or whatever

[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:31.860]
that thing is there on Miami Beach where the dog track used to be, a government cut, and you drive

[00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:38.300]
all the way up, all the way up, Collins Avenue and up a bisqueen or A1A or bisqueen boulevard, whichever

[00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:44.380]
you choose, federal highway, up, Dayton, Broward, and take a look around you and you'll cry. You will cry

[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:49.840]
when you see what's going on. Bad what's happening to us because the area of the landmass has

[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:56.480]
such potential. Yeah. Well, good luck to us all, man. Yeah. Thank you. Bye-bye. What am I getting hysterical

[00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:08.200]
about? Mess with success. 20 minutes before 11 at WINZ and let's go to North Miami Beach. Hello. Yes. This is Nature Boy Dino.

[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:13.680]
I like to get a few things off my chest if I can on the air. It's nothing

[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:20.480]
dirty or nothing. It's just how I feel about what's happened to my land. The reason I call it my land

[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:27.520]
is I've been here for 40 years. I'm 42 years old. I was born in Brooklyn in Raisin, Miami in

[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:34.160]
Haya, Liyah. Excuse me. I just moved out of Haya, Liyah. I built my own house there. I spent 25

[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:42.820]
years on my life building it. I lived 35 years there, as I said, and I've seen it change, as I've

[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:49.440]
seen a lot of other things change in my land. And I kind of discussed it about the whole thing. There's

[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:55.480]
not much anybody wants to do about it except like you said, smile about how nice everything is and

[00:30:55.480 --> 00:31:03.120]
it's really not. I'm an old diver, skin diver, and you're talking about South Beach. I know just about

[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:07.580]
every rock out there on the Jeddies. I've been diving here since I was about seven or eight years old.

[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:13.900]
And first I want to attack the Army Corps of Engineers. They come down here and they say, oh,

[00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:20.520]
what you got to do is replenish the land on the beaches. And the hotel owners who has all the money

[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:25.800]
says, yeah, fine, it's a good idea. We'll buy it. But the people didn't say have a chance to say

[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:29.600]
anything about it because the people just don't know. How many people living here are divers?

[00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:34.180]
Know anything about what's underneath the water. So the Army Corps of Engineers come here with

[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:41.340]
their big pipes and they suck up all the dirt and rock. Sir, for the benefit of the audience,

[00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:45.060]
I understand the point you're trying to make, but you're going to put the audience into a coma.

[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:50.020]
Oh, yeah, my wife does now put my kids to sleep all the time. Exactly. And you know, the point is a

[00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:55.020]
valid one, but you know, that isn't really rough. That's just a tip of the iceberg. Exactly.

[00:31:55.520 --> 00:32:01.940]
I like to talk about the train and jails. I think if we got rid of the jails and build barracks

[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:05.320]
out there instead of building barracks on the school grounds, they're putting the children in a little

[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:10.780]
barracks and we build barracks out in the Everglades. And we put all these guys that are

[00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:16.560]
selling drugs in jail without air conditioning and color TV. I think they'll think twice about going to jail.

[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:23.120]
I still live. Okay, let's go to Miami Beach. Hello. Hello, Neil. Hi. Neil, can I know just

[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:27.280]
going to waste a little time, but you might as well do it. It's just probably part of the purpose.

[00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:33.680]
I have not read the article of New York Times because I can't find it yet. I want you to have

[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:38.540]
a copy of it right in my hand. Yeah, what about if you read it? The whole thing. At the fall. No,

[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:43.760]
it goes on for like seven or eight pages. Stand there, but that way, you know, I don't want to make

[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:48.520]
a comic without knowing what, you know, is in the article. So I'm not going to make a comic. I've

[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:53.800]
already said the essence of the article is it says can Miami save itself a city be set by drugs

[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:58.160]
in violence? And it talks about the fact that most corporations don't want to come here because of

[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:03.340]
the image of the community and about the fact that we have a housing cost in Dave County have gone

[00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:09.320]
way down since 1982 and the last five years and about, you know, the ethnic tensions that exist

[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:14.280]
here and about the right wing mentality of the big segment of the Cuban population, which is

[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:18.760]
alienated the rest of the population and the fact that this ought to be the most liberal day

[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:22.440]
used to be the most liberal county in the state of Florida. Now, of course, it's become a right

[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:28.760]
wing county. You know, basically, it's, it's just an understatement of the truth about what this

[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:32.880]
town has become. That's all it, you know, it doesn't require taking an hour and a half or two hours

[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:38.080]
to sit and read the whole thing on the air. It just it just tells it like it is. But again,

[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:43.080]
it's very superficial. It's only just scratching the tiniest tip of the iceberg in terms of how

[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:47.600]
this community has deteriorated. It doesn't even go into the fact that about tourism, for example,

[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:52.340]
no mention of the way that Orlando is taking away so much of our tourism or the fact that, you know,

[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:56.540]
we allow Disney to get away in the casino gambling thing doesn't make any mention of that.

[00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:00.540]
We're trying to be taken away. Exactly. No mention of that. Okay, what about

[00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:06.040]
this is only this is only about the city of Miami. There is no mention of Fort Lauderdale,

[00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:10.420]
no mention of anything else as though the city is like kind of self-sustaining and supporting.

[00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:14.660]
And there's nothing else but marsh and the Everglades around it. Okay, then in other words,

[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:19.900]
it's an overreaction by the politicians again. Exactly. Exactly. They're just trying to, you know,

[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.720]
you know, when a dog does its number in the backyard, how it kind of runs a couple of feet away

[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:28.660]
and then it kicks its hind legs up and kicks some dirt up in the air like it's trying to cover up.

[00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:32.960]
That's what the politicians are doing. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Okay.

[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:39.800]
And the politicians have done exactly to us what the dog did in the backyard. Okay, they've done that

[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:45.000]
on us over and over and over again. They have no solutions, they have no suggestions, they have no

[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:51.560]
answers, they have no nothing. But Blue Sky, that's all they can do is continue to lie and to lie and

[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:56.320]
to lie. And Chief Dixon, I'm going to tell you something what's going on in your city.

[00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:02.520]
In all parts of the city of Miami with animals and I do mean animals out there on the streets

[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:08.160]
selling crack and just a smorgasbord of every kind of drug that's ever been invented is so pervasive

[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:13.700]
and so disgusting, you want to hang your head in shame. And the people who live in those neighborhoods

[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:18.800]
with those barbarians and those animals who permit this to go on in their back yards and right

[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:26.160]
under their noses, they ought to hang their heads in shame. What a disgrace. What an absolute disgrace.

[00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:31.780]
And here we have all these big stories on the nightly news on our local channels Crack cocaine

[00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:37.660]
and this and and you know something it's getting worse, not better it's getting worse as every day

[00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:45.740]
goes by. Worse. And I see our friends in Broward are really into this man. We got every line in

[00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:50.520]
Broward is wide open. This is just like old times again, isn't it? Now you understand why I gave up

[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:55.840]
doing this kind of show because the people who live here also are a big part of the problem. They don't

[00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:01.640]
give a damn. They're willing to accept any kind of crap. They don't you know, oh, we're going to get

[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:05.560]
the attempting on our windows and we're going to go out and buy some more guns and we'll get some more

[00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:10.760]
security systems. They don't give a damn about anything. That's the thing that really gets me.

[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.980]
Boy, I never forget living through that business in 1980 and 1981. I mean, that was really some picnic.

[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:22.860]
I mean, there were bodies popping. They were almost like bodies falling out of the sky in this town.

[00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:29.440]
A couple nights when I left the South day to go home on Dixie Highway, I remember seeing these big cars

[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:35.940]
sideways in the middle of the on the opposite lanes of Dixie Highway with bodies and blood. It was

[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:42.920]
like watching Miami Vice-Sony. It was the real world. And nobody wanted to talk about it. Nobody

[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:47.540]
cared about it. And you people, those of you who are here who live in your little ivory towers,

[00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:52.360]
you don't care. You don't care. So I don't know why the politicians are overreacting,

[00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:56.700]
getting hysterical or why I'm even bringing this up again this morning because the people don't give

[00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:03.480]
it then. And when it comes to the politicians and when it comes to our quality of life and when

[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:07.920]
it comes to the drugs and when it comes to anything serious, that's why six months ago on this

[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:13.540]
program or seven months ago, I stopped trying to save the world from itself because the people in

[00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:18.020]
this community, man, are like vegetables. They are brain dead and then some. They're beyond brain

[00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:23.520]
dead. Whatever the stage is beyond brain dead, that's what the people are in this area. So we'll laugh

[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:27.860]
and we'll puke and we'll play all our cute little stuff and we'll do our thing and that's what we're

[00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:32.760]
going to do on this show. Believe me, I have no idea whatever possessed me, whatever got into me.

[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:35.480]
To come in and bring this crap up again today.

[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:49.560]
It's like never, never land. Oh, I live in plantation and I live in Davy and I live in Cooper City

[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:54.500]
and I live in Kendall and what, like I said a couple of weeks ago, what is it all revolve around

[00:37:54.500 --> 00:38:01.500]
in the answer is nothing, nothing. These are isolated little meaningless communities that have

[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:04.480]
nothing to do with each other and nothing to do with nothing.

[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:17.480]
Royal Oak, Harper Woods, Gross Point, they're suburbs of Detroit, they're something real,

[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:21.780]
they're something, I mean, it may not be great but at least it's real, they're something tangible.

[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:30.460]
And the same in New York and in Chicago, in LA and San Francisco, in every real city in America,

[00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:34.320]
but this is not a real city, this is just fantasy land. Let's make believe.

[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:45.240]
Miami Beach, hello. Hello, Neil. Yes. You are so right, you predicted always years ago and it happens.

[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:49.560]
It happens. And you know something the people didn't care then and they still don't care now.

[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:54.960]
I want you to know if they don't get up and start doing something. What, wait a minute, wait a minute,

[00:38:54.960 --> 00:39:00.560]
what are they going to do? Start doing what? They're crazy. Get up and fight the goddamn politicians

[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:07.240]
that are in here. How dare they come here and try to dictate to us? Well here, for years I was born here.

[00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:13.600]
They got no rights to dictate the way they are to tell you that you got a higher mark.

[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:19.980]
Newspings, how many unemployed Americans are there here? How dare they say this?

[00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:26.040]
And how dare they come from all over the world and grab the places back with countries and kill

[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:32.100]
animals and slaughter them with gold juice and they're crazy. These people are absolutely out of their mind.

[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:38.440]
And goddamn it, brain, I blame Carter. They ought to take them back where he lives and keep them there.

[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.080]
Are you?

[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:53.520]
Like I said, we should have called last year this morning. It's 11 before 11 at WYNZ. We have an open line in

[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:56.800]
Brown, and it's before 11 at WYNZ. Carl Geibels, hello.

[00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:59.400]
Hey, good morning Neil. Yes. How you doing? Okay.

[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:06.200]
Listen, I'm only 16, but unlike unfortunately many of my friends, I happen to know exactly what's

[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:11.680]
going on in this town and it's very frightening. I've lived your all my life born here and it scares

[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:17.060]
me very much. And that, you know, the problem is I think about like if I remain in this town,

[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:21.840]
what will this city, if it's, you know, the way it is now, what's going to be like in 20 years?

[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:30.440]
And it's absolutely, it's scary to think of what this town will be like in 20 years because

[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:36.600]
the politicians right now, they're just, they're combatose, they're intellectually combatose.

[00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:41.020]
I mean the lights are on and no one is home in these politicians heads.

[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:47.500]
But it's not only the politicians, the people who live here, re-elect every incumbent,

[00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:52.960]
they're, the people are the most unsophisticated voters, perhaps, of any large city in America here.

[00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:58.340]
They go out, there are never any issues, you know, and it's not only Cubans, the Jews are the same

[00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:02.720]
way. There's Barry Schriver with his Yamakan. Hey, we love Barry, he's dancing the horror and it

[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:06.320]
makes no difference. All they got to do is go out and pander to the ethnic group that's, that

[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:11.820]
predominates their particular area that they're in and man, they're back in over and over and over

[00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:16.740]
again. And no matter how stupid they are and how divisive they are and how counterproductive they

[00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:20.900]
are, we keep putting them back over and over again. And then every time something like this article

[00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:25.140]
comes on, everybody gets on a year. Well, it's the politicians who the hell keeps putting

[00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:30.140]
them back into office. The thing is, I look at that, they, all the kids in my high school and most

[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:35.280]
of these people, most of these kids in 10 years are going to be the same way I can tell, I can see it.

[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:40.340]
The, I mean, it's in 10 years, they'll be doing the same thing. The politicians will pander to them.

[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:45.480]
All right, I want to ask you a question, a serious question. If kids in your school want to get crack

[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:50.160]
or they want to get any drug they want, do they have to go far to get it? Not my school. I mean,

[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:57.320]
I'm in it. I go to a very, I go to a, not a, it's an I go to school in Kendall. Yeah, it's a pretty

[00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:03.220]
basically a white collar school, about a third, third black, about a third, a little less than

[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:08.700]
third black predominant, the majority one is white and then you guys, you know, a lot of

[00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:13.760]
spandex too. But I'm telling you, if you want it, if you want the drugs, if you want the crack,

[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:19.440]
there are connections you can make, okay? It's just that it's very sad too. And the thing is,

[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:25.160]
we're one of the better schools too. I go to one of the better schools in terms of drug,

[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:31.280]
during some of the inner city schools, Miami High and who knows what else there? I mean, it's

[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:37.760]
disgusting. I mean, I've heard things that they really do scare me and these kids in 10 years,

[00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:43.940]
if they even, you know, know how to vote who knows. But they'll be doing the same thing in 20 years

[00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:50.140]
from now will be in the same thing New York Times. Can Miami save itself part 62? Yeah. And it's

[00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:55.800]
really scary. Okay. I appreciate hearing from you. And I'm going to say something that's going to

[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:59.480]
get a lot of, I've said this before, it's nothing brand new, but you're just not supposed to say it in

[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:05.200]
polite company and especially not on the air. You people in the black community, you blacks in this

[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:10.280]
town who sit back and, and I'm not saying that all blacks pedal drugs and all blacks are permissive,

[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:14.500]
but I'm going to tell you something what's going on in the black sections of Dayton,

[00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:19.280]
Broward County. And I'm guaranteeing in a lot of the black sections of big cities all across

[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:24.180]
this country, is it a disgrace and don't tell me about discrimination and don't tell me that you

[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:29.640]
can't go out and get an honest job. Oh, but it's the white man. We'd be the lackeys of the white

[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:34.240]
man. They'd be the ones that are getting, providing all the drugs. You know, it's, you know, nobody is

[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:39.620]
twisting anybody's arm. Nobody's holding a gun to anybody's head forcing them to go out and pedal

[00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:51.160]
drugs. Nobody. But boy, what a cushway that is to make a living man. And every place that you

[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:55.740]
will find large numbers of black people in Dayton, Broward counties, and I'm not saying that, you

[00:43:55.740 --> 00:44:00.080]
know, we don't have Hispanics dealing in drugs. We don't have Anglo-is-dealing in drugs, but the

[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:07.400]
black areas and where blacks continue moving in are just overrun with people standing on the streets

[00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:16.060]
from Miami to Homestead to Fort Lauderdale to Lauderdale. You name it. And I'm going to tell you

[00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:20.440]
something. Those aren't human beings. Those are animals. Those are barbarians.

[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:28.060]
And I don't know, Chief Thicks. And maybe we don't have enough jail cells, but I'm going to tell

[00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:33.040]
you something. We got to find some way to round those barbarians up and get them off the streets.

[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:38.040]
We didn't have any problem putting illegal aliens in the chrome detention center. Why don't we put

[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:43.480]
some of the barbarians in chrome and lock them away there until we get cells available in our prisons?

[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:50.220]
Because this is what's destroying this town. And as I said yesterday, if anybody really thinks that

[00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:54.480]
the majority of people here understand how pervasive the drug problem is in this town, they're

[00:44:54.480 --> 00:45:02.640]
living in a dream world. It's everywhere. Tourism long since, long ago, stopped being the number one.

[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:09.420]
Economic part of our community. Drugs has been the number one part of the economy in this area for

[00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:17.320]
years now. And it's getting bigger and worse every single day. And how people with any kind of

[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:22.840]
conscience, how people with any kind of soul can sit back and permit this to go on under their

[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:28.940]
noses and permit their children and their grandchildren to be doing this and to be destroying other

[00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:35.860]
people's lives beats the hell out of me. But we're not supposed to talk about it and then the

[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:41.080]
art title bombs come along and all the other we have what is that group foot down there where we have

[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:45.760]
the community relations board and oh gee we better do something about these talk show hosts and

[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:50.260]
about neo-rodgers. I'm going to tell you something the truth never heard anybody. The truth only

[00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:55.900]
hurt those people who deserve to be hurt and expose those people who deserve to be exposed.

[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:05.520]
And this is a community that's asleep a community that's a la la land because the people don't give a

[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:11.000]
damn they're busy off in their little ivory tower as I said off in plantation and they're off in

[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:16.040]
Cooper City and wherever the hell it is. And don't confuse them with you know the bigger picture

[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:22.580]
because they don't care. And I'm getting a headache sitting here you know deluding myself into

[00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:27.680]
thinking that I'm going to get them to care I know differently they're not going to care for

[00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:34.140]
love or money. Mike Wolf is here with the headlines CBS News at 11 o'clock and we'll come back with

[00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:38.140]
our number two here. I'll tell you if you want to make this very simplistic the two biggest

[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:45.180]
problems with this whole area there are too many old people and there are too many I'm looking

[00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:49.220]
for the right word I don't want to say foreigners because that would sound like taffy McCallum.

[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:56.080]
There is too much riff raff that has come here on boats and on rafts and God only knows how they

[00:46:56.080 --> 00:47:02.060]
got here and they're you know destroying the area destroying it they're turning it into a cesspool.

[00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:08.880]
And all of these limousine liberal friends of mine you know the ones who love to live in the sub-roves

[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:12.700]
but like to tell everybody else they should live in the inner city all of those limousine liberals

[00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:17.100]
who would point the finger and call you a bigot because you move out when certain groups start

[00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:23.420]
moving in how many of your people would like to live in a cesspool how many of you would like to

[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:27.520]
live in the kind of conditions that you can see in this community where people are living like animals

[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:33.360]
like barbarians who throw their garbage on their front lawn whose children peddle drugs on the

[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:38.380]
street corner it'll five o'clock in the morning till the sun comes up but see that's a problem in

[00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:43.000]
this country if you say what you really feel then you're a bigot then everybody's going to attack you

[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.260]
and they're going to try to muzzle you and shut you up and then you know the status quo we go back

[00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:51.860]
to the way things are and nobody can understand why we can't solve the problems Miami hello

[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:56.520]
good morning Neil how you doing okay yeah i wouldn't like to live in a cesspool leader

[00:47:58.060 --> 00:48:03.740]
i'd tell you one thing i'm kind of from i'm in i'm between a rock and a hard place i'm i'm a

[00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:09.560]
a Cuban American first and a Cuban second and you can tell by my language i speak pretty good english

[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:15.680]
and my Spanish isn't that bad but like i'm like i said i'm like between a hard and a hard place i

[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:20.260]
love this country i love what it stands for i hate some of these people they come out here and they

[00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:25.840]
come to this country and they don't learn the language and they pose their views and their language

[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:30.580]
on other people no it's even worse is when they do learn the language and they refuse to speak it

[00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:36.280]
in public because they want to be rude and obnoxious and arrogant and disgusting that's even worse

[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:40.840]
yes it is and i want to tell you something that happened the on friday i wrote with a highway

[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:47.100]
patrol officer as an observer we pulled over a Latin male he was drunk and took him down to the

[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:52.180]
when the officer started reading them his rights you know to do the d.y. test and the

[00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:57.340]
videotape and all that when he was videotape the officer asked him i'm going to read your rights

[00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:01.780]
in english and the guy goes i know i speak english and the officer read him in english and

[00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:06.760]
then read him in spanish but about 10 minutes into the whole the whole steel about the d.y.or s

[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:13.020]
the guy goes in perfect english he goes i need to go to a bathroom i don't go to the bathroom i'm

[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:18.500]
going to tinkle all over myself and that was being read a videotape so i imagine when that guy

[00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:22.700]
stands in front of a judge and the judge views that videotape what's the judge going to do

[00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:28.800]
you know i can't understand and one of these people come to this country and they love this

[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:33.300]
country but then again they want to impose who says they love this country what makes you say that

[00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:37.700]
well that's what they say yeah no they love to take advantage of what

[00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:41.400]
opportunities the country has given them but that doesn't mean they love the country

[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:46.280]
and it takes me off because like i said i don't keep my love this country and i've been here and

[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:50.820]
and you know there's nothing i wouldn't do and if for del Castro falls tomorrow i bet you

[00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:55.940]
that half of these people that you listen to on these spanish radio stations who are getting all

[00:49:55.940 --> 00:50:00.000]
these old Cubans all riled up about cuban for the other one they wouldn't go back they wouldn't go

[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:23.040]
this is a good response to the uh to the last caller and while we ordinarily don't mention Steve's

[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:27.980]
name on the show we certainly would at this point because we know that he's listening and from

[00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:33.600]
10 to 3 the ratings are just in from the spring arbitrage rating book is in that interesting

[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:40.200]
well let's start from the bottom let's start from the very bottom with w and w s a 3.3

[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:52.060]
w i o d a 3.6 and w i n z a 9.0 by the way i'm not working Saturdays anymore okay um let's say

[00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:57.400]
it's 11.14 at w i n z we'll get you know a lot more on this and we'll you know spend just we don't

[00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:01.240]
want to spend a lot of time on it right you know maybe till like maybe till four or five i'll stick

[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:05.340]
around with Stan and we'll go over all of the numbers and to break it down because we like to

[00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:11.180]
spread the truth on this show a nine okay is there anybody in the audience who had and of course

[00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:16.360]
now the logical thing if Bob Rich were the general manager Bob would come in and sit down and say to

[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:25.200]
me we need an 18 realistically minimum 18 in order to survive okay a nine share in midday and I

[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:29.700]
thank the audience because really as I said 9% of the people did I say this just the other day

[00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:34.900]
9 or 10% of the people in this town have their heads on straight they listen to this show the other

[00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:41.980]
90% more on so okay so i'm not insulting the audience i'm insulting the rest of the public out

[00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:48.300]
there who are doing whatever they're doing what are they doing listening to music they're listening

[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:54.300]

[01:00:54.300 --> 01:01:03.940]
sell my show and the answer is of course not let's see now who's this with a five four uh oh

[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:14.500]

[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:15.580]
okay so those are the numbers as we have them and of course so we'll be getting a little bit more

[01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:20.800]
on this is the returns from the farm belt comes in so a stick around and we can gloat and we can

[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:25.420]
jump up and down carry on and uh... just you know do a kazansky on a year together so all of those

[01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:28.920]
people out there who'd like me to be off the air and all the people who send the hate mail and

[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:32.780]
who would like to have the news back in midday and are all upset because we don't have admiral

[01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:39.880]
point dexter will give them the italian salute exactly stick it where the moon don't shine is basically

[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:48.720]
the message but of course it was a lot of fun but now i think we have to go back

[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:56.720]
of course we don't want to do too well because like i told you when you do too well

[01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:02.960]
then everybody starts getting real nervous real nervous like the people in the programming

[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:08.660]
department there always nervous and if you do too well then you attract a lot of attention so

[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:12.880]
if we can cut it you know like slide back a lot of guests exactly let's bring back those boring

[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:17.560]
guests you know i was thinking our fred shots was really good yesterday and he put passed out a

[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:21.800]
lot of good information very important information but i want to say this

[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:26.720]
i sat in there with tuity bird in the programming office this morning and i said to him

[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:33.020]
as of this moment i'm beginning to think that perhaps no guests ever

[01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:34.880]
might be the way to go

[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:40.960]
now i hate to say that because there's some people we have on every now and then i really like like jica

[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:46.160]
and cospherd and linda thorton and uh... steanie segretto and you know there there may be about a

[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:48.320]
half a dozen ten whatever it is

[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:52.220]
that i enjoy and we have a good time together but i i don't know

[01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:54.620]
i don't know

[01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:59.660]
we'll find out okay we had a couple of people drop off in date and i have you know profusely

[01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:02.540]
apologize from the bottom of my heart because i know we kept you waiting

[01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:06.460]
and you're really i got you worked up to a frenzy about what this town is turning into a

[01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:08.040]
new york times and all this other stuff

[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:12.880]
and uh... you know we lost three callers while i went through this whole tirade this self-aggrandizement

[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:13.620]
about the ratings

[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:19.540]
but this is what it's all about this is what we live in di four okay now i'm sitting here with a nine

[01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:23.340]
now mister pompus over there on that other station whose name we don't mention

[01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:29.500]
when his book comes out uh... you know obviously he wasn't a part of this but when the um...

[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:30.900]
summer book comes out

[01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:35.820]
i'd be very curious to see what that number is we compare numbers that would be interesting

[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:40.120]
okay let's go back to the call look at that just about everybody dropped off

[01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:45.200]
you know something i don't think i'm even going to try to go back to it i really don't

[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:49.080]
now i don't think i'm going to go back to it i think i'm just going to play uh... the whole rack

[01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:49.900]
don't you

[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:54.240]
we didn't take any calls yesterday look how painless that was everything was wonderful

[01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:59.400]
until two o'clock when i was about to leave and i got called into our program directors office

[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:01.080]
and then it was not so wonderful

[01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:06.140]
and i thought to myself when i got up this morning should i really go in there to work today or should i just

[01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:10.020]
you know kind of go out on strike should i pick at the radio station and just have a big

[01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:12.120]
placard that says mess with success

[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:16.260]
you see because obviously based on these numbers i don't know what i'm doing in any

[01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:18.060]
delotted direction and a lot of restrictions

[01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:25.080]
and one of the things that's happened on this radio station and it's because thank goodness

[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:28.660]
we have had a tremendous amount of latitude is that we've

[01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:29.420]
brought

[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:32.500]
enormous numbers of people back to a m radio

[01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:37.220]
because we've had a lot of latitude and we haven't had people standing over our shoulders

[01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:38.860]
assuming that we didn't know what we were doing

[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.020]
i don't hear you how come i don't hear him

[01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:51.600]
ron herrison is driving home he just stopped at the shell city liquor store to get a bottle of champagne

[01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:53.300]
he wants to hear the morning numbers again

[01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:56.220]
all i don't i don't have the morning numbers

[01:05:57.140 --> 01:05:59.320]
how come i don't have the numbers for the rest of the day

[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:04.280]
maybe there's still things probably yeah no i don't think so because i got 10 to 3

[01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:09.000]
six to 10 would come first yeah exactly how come they don't bring me i'd love to

[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.900]
attute the horn about the rest of the station

[01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:15.660]
about our great morning drive news which is i mean if anybody listens to the news in the

[01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:17.480]
morning on any other station they got to be a fool

[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:23.100]
and i've been saying that ever since i came to this radio station i'd say it with all sincerity

[01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:28.300]
we have great news people in the morning and for the life of me i have no idea why anybody would

[01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:34.060]
choose to listen to any other station for news in the morning or any time for that matter

[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:38.280]
well there is one hour but i'm not going to get into that because i've been told don't you know

[01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:44.460]
don't say it there is one hour in the early evening i don't want to mention what time it is after

[01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:47.740]
staying gets off the air but i'm not going to talk about it

[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:54.380]
let me just give the numbers out again and i don't you know at this point i don't care what you do

[01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:57.420]
you know what i'm saying i don't care what you want to talk about if you want to keep up with the

[01:06:57.420 --> 01:07:01.180]
New York Times because i know that nobody gives it am i can sit here and get all emotional

[01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:05.520]
get my blood pressure up and scream and holler about the animals peddling drugs and the towns

[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:10.620]
turned into a cesspool and we've got you making gangs and this kind of gang and you know it's

[01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:16.040]
pathetic it's really sad you know i guess the new thing you know when you're when you're some part

[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:20.300]
of a ethnic minority now the new thing in america unlike what it used to be years ago then

[01:07:20.300 --> 01:07:25.420]
no i shouldn't say that because even years ago we had all these other gangs that's true it's not

[01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:28.460]
different but it's just a lot more unpleasant now because we're living through it

[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:34.620]
but what is it that gives you the right when you come into the country to all of a sudden

[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:39.500]
have a large segment of your people be barbarians i'm not sure i understand that

[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:47.960]
north day perhaps has the answer to the question hello i wish i did but i don't i didn't think so

[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:55.380]
wish i did well first of all congratulations thank you okay and for god's

[01:07:55.380 --> 01:08:01.880]
make don't give up the phone we live for it let me ask you something well i don't even know

[01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:06.600]
what to talk about that at the truth i know you know but the thing that irk to me is that

[01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:15.720]
these god damn telephones that we are paying phone bills for every employee of the city they're

[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:22.400]
calling australia they're calling all of the universe and we are paying for those calls

[01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:25.700]
i think the auto called trailways for a one-way bus ticket

[01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:31.060]
and i think we'd be delighted to donate 75 bucks a piece for each one of them to

[01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:37.160]
for a one-way ticket to anywhere they want to go this is terrible deal and him with five phones

[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:43.040]
yeah well he has to have a phone for each suit of course but you know what it's funny and yet

[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:47.200]
it is so pathetic do we by the way do we know where he got the phones and how much he paid for them

[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:51.920]
oh that might be interesting yeah that's it the only thing i heard he got him at the flea market at

[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:58.900]
a special discount it's all good i hope probably yeah i don't know what else to talk about i just

[01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:04.760]
want to say congratulations thanks a lot hang in there keep your head above water okay okay

[01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:09.420]

[01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:37.580]
so-called management people at all they should be suburb suburb of subbishop to your

[01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:43.900]
your desires uh after all you make it go all right now that's stroking i want to get down to

[01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:47.300]
something that i know about personally and i think it might be interesting i'd give

[01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:53.800]
to your listening people back in the sixties when the first cubans came over the so-called

[01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:59.440]
they weren't wealthy people they had the retinues and they had the groups of they had tremendous

[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:04.620]
retinues i was a mailman i delivered mail to them we had a project out there called westchester

[01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:10.540]
it's not a project that is very shouldn't be used but it was very fine homes built in the

[01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:16.300]
wonderful neighborhood these homes were just begging nobody wanted nobody could buy them

[01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:20.220]
they were too expensive at that time back in the early sixties i think they were eighteen

[01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:25.580]
vowed and they had central air they had every convene is so on all of a sudden i see this

[01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:33.600]
influx of groups of people going into each home and i see from from six months old all the way up

[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:39.760]
and then i see what retinue retinue similar to what marcos would have and then i started

[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:47.520]
delivering checks and then i would find my amazing that everybody got a check welfare whatever

[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:53.900]
them these are let me see all those are mirrors i never called them on radio before but they were the

[01:13:53.900 --> 01:14:01.240]
rest oh did you want me to stop that now go ahead i'm listening and then once a month i found out

[01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:06.600]
that i was delivering two hundred fifty dollar checks to anybody that was in the bill of they have

[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:12.720]
picked they have picked operation so this is where a lot of the money was now these were the people

[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:17.020]
that were supposed to be the cadre or the by the way a lot of those folks that were out there that

[01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:23.380]
i recognized names from those days at presidents of banks for nowadays and really have gotten up in

[01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:28.740]
this world but they let's place it they were never down in any other world in cuba or here

[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:34.560]
but if you can just imagine all those checks and went out there and the funny part of a sidebar

[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:42.320]
this is i want to deliver the the seats uh cia checks they were in the regular envelope

[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:47.480]
and i noticed that the place was in the building in coral gables and i sent something to the

[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:55.140]
coral gables he said nobody's supposed to know that's cia but um was just was interesting to me

[01:14:55.140 --> 01:15:01.400]
anyway he got let me see i'm a little nervous i never called them on radio before but i knew

[01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:06.000]
it all right okay 20 minutes till noon at wion z we have an open line in day six two four

[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.900]
9400 we have a um i think we'll take the collect call from west palm beach because we're trying

[01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:16.260]
to conserve hello hi nale hi congratulations on your numbers thank you and despite what management

[01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:20.860]
says continue to do we just what you're doing right now obviously it's working yeah i always do the

[01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:24.940]
opposite of what they say and look how well it's worked out that's right and i think you should get

[01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:30.840]
Saturdays off i think only at you everyone else works five days a week yeah and slave labor i thought

[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:35.500]
that was illegal that's right management doesn't work six days a week no do you that'd be a cold day

[01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:40.240]
in hell when you'd see them here on the weekend you should get off also question on iod what happened to

[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:46.140]
them not that i care anymore what happened to them now i care you said four is number well you

[01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:48.540]
of network they sent it back to my company and said answer this lady so he called me up and said

[01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:57.400]
they are now into high tech radio what high tech radio did he really see that high tech what is that

[01:16:57.400 --> 01:17:01.560]
it's other than the helicopter i think you misunderstood him i think he said high-dreck

[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:08.160]
he said high tech radio you want it you want to know what high tech radio is listen

[01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:16.280]
you hear it can you hear it yeah what is it that's it that's high tech

[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:25.800]

[01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:18.220]
exciting that means you're well you know what that really means it just dawned on me see high tech i

[01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:22.240]
guess has to do with equipment and that's why they're putting all those board ops on the air

[01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:25.880]
because they're familiar with all that new modern equipment that they brought in so that's high

[01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:30.240]
tech radio you bring in all your board ops and you put them on the air okay we have a couple of

[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:35.600]
open lines one on each county in day six two four nine four hundred and in brownered five two

[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:40.540]

[01:18:40.540 --> 01:18:45.280]
last several months but you know some of us never learn and of course when i left here yesterday

[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:50.880]
i was somewhat psychotic a little bit psychotic because i got a good talking to yesterday and i was

[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:56.260]
told no uncertain terms that you know some of these things they just have got a change and of course

[01:18:56.260 --> 01:19:00.620]
if we go up into an eleven in the next book then for sure we'll have to change because we like to

[01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:07.320]
mess with success at w i n z now you see it's like the old saying about if it's not broken don't fix it

nobody would like that better than i would i think he would be so great from

[01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:21.620]

congratulations they'll keep knocking them down thanks a lot Steve

[01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:51.820]
bye bye yeah they have that burger king mentality they want to do it their

[01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:54.720]
way you know which generally when you're dealing with management in this

[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:58.740]
business their way is the wrong way and don't you know don't bother with us

[01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:01.800]
those of us one year because we're morons we don't know anything we're just you

[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:05.660]
know those on a year people man we're just a bunch of p-ons so they go ahead and

[01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:08.940]
they p-on us all the time you know that's the bottom line we're just p-ons

[01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:11.780]
and i'm only sitting here with a nine share in the midday

[01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:17.860]
there's no such thing there is no such number okay no such number in daytime

[01:21:17.860 --> 01:21:21.480]
radio in a market with thirty seven signals it doesn't exist

[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:27.640]
but i will say this Gary did come in here and he went like that and then he ran

[01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:30.360]
out of the building because he knows that we're going to be renegotiating my

[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:33.880]
contract or i'm not showing up tomorrow okay where we going south Miami

[01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:39.120]
hello hello how you doing fine thank you mr. Rogers just got off work a couple

[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:44.980]
hours ago we're listening to you at the station and i work for the federal government

[01:21:44.980 --> 01:21:51.180]
when the agencies mentioned in that article in New York Times yeah and been in

[01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:55.160]
Miami now about seven years and i'd say that the people here in Miami are some

[01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:59.200]
of the most uncooperative people well you can say that again i can i can vouch

[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:05.340]
for that on this show i'll tell you i mean it's unbelievable and the stigma that

[01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:11.040]
my wife or myself you get in this community being employed by an agency

[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:16.480]
it's unbelievable they think that we're some kind of outcast and you know it's

[01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:21.360]
in eighteen years and sometimes you just want to give up and maybe the best thing to do

[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:28.880]
is let all these people run a muck run a muck run a muck all the i mean we try to do

[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:36.000]
what we can but all we get is bad publicity and in no cooperation whatsoever i

[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:40.180]
think i may have a good idea maybe what we ought to do is take all of the rift

[01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:44.920]
wrath all of the drug people all of the undesirables and what we do is we'll build

[01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:47.820]
you know they're very big on walls here lately you know the big wall in for

[01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:52.000]
Lauderdale and the wall in Helen Delao I had to do is build a big wall around

[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:56.720]
the city of Miami like the Berlin wall and jam all of these people in there and

[01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:00.180]
you know we'll let all the nice people out who want to get out first and we'll just jam

[01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:02.660]
a wall in there we'll leave them in there and we'll just ignore it and we'll let the

[01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:05.860]
politicians you know try to control them and you know they'll deserve each other

[01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:10.640]
and you know they make it harder and harder now because one of the little tricks a lot of them

[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:15.540]
have is a lot of these people is that they don't speak English and they understand

[01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:19.620]
and they do speak English well when it's convenient for them they speak it

[01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:24.760]
that you know always the innocent the stupidity type act they put on yeah

[01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:30.480]
and now with all these new policies from the I.N.S. you don't know who it is who

[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:38.420]
you don't know whether this person is a legal alien illegal alien and it's one of

[01:23:38.420 --> 01:23:43.360]
these things that the policy is just unbelievable just let everybody in and we'll

[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:49.620]
take worry about it later so you know it's just a shame that in Texas it was

[01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:53.580]
completely different thing the people in here in Miami they just want to be

[01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:56.660]
left alone they don't care what's going on next door yeah now they're oblivious

[01:23:56.660 --> 01:23:59.360]
and don't forget most of them came here to escape and to get away and they're just

[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:03.560]
they have that kind of mindset and nothing you can do is going to change it and we

[01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:06.660]
just have far too many of these retirees here there's nothing wrong with being

[01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:10.500]
retired there's nothing wrong with being old but we just got this really warped

[01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:14.120]
population here and it's just not working out yeah I'm one of these I guess I grew

[01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:18.840]
up wrong or you know someone tries to sell you a new color television for $50

[01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:24.780]
yeah you know that it's stolen so if there's no buyers there'll be no sellers

[01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:30.860]
and and people you know that on the up and up we'll go ahead and brag about buying

[01:24:30.860 --> 01:24:35.700]
a TV for $50 yeah like like Sergio you know he wants to be a great rule model for

[01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:40.260]
our youth in the date county yeah and they want to raise taxes now well yeah

[01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:43.860]
because we got to you know subsidize all of those suits that he's buying and I

[01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:47.380]
don't see how people can continue living here because it just gets outrageous

[01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:52.440]
and property value going down but he says they're going up I don't understand

[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:56.920]
well sir good luck we'll need it thanks for calling thank you sir

[01:24:57.620 --> 01:25:01.520]
ten minutes till noon at w.i.n.c we have two open lines in date now where people

[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:05.000]
are expiring like flies did you hear the story on the news this morning by the

[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:08.240]
way about the new state gun law where they repeal the previous law and what they

[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:11.080]
didn't our legislature in their infinite wisdom what they didn't realize when they

[01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:15.160]
repeal the previous law what they did in effect was make it legal for people

[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:19.300]
in Florida now to walk around carrying guns as long as they're not completely

[01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:23.720]
concealed based on the new law now you can walk around anywhere and carry a gun

[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:28.100]
even if you don't have a permit as long as it's not concealed you can walk around

[01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:31.660]
with a gun so stand must really be excited about that because he you know he's a

[01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:34.920]
great advocate of bringing a wild west back and having everybody carry a gun on

[01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:38.600]
their holster so that when you go trolling around in the broward mall and somebody

[01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:43.580]
gives you a dirty look you can get even real quick we have another break to do

[01:25:43.580 --> 01:25:48.740]
don't we I think nine minutes till noon at w.i.n.c I can't believe we have

[01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:52.780]
night for midnight for so many years and I made the point that you know my goal

[01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:56.520]
was to expand not to take away anybody else's audience maybe a little bit here

[01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:59.380]
although it is interesting that all those people are on at this time period are

[01:25:59.380 --> 01:26:05.820]
gone all of them are gone in ten months they're either off the

[01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:09.940]
air or there in another time period it's really bizarre but anyway my point

[01:26:09.940 --> 01:26:14.060]
was to expand the talk market during this period of time because we got this

[01:26:14.060 --> 01:26:17.660]
incredible signal which is going to be even better the day that we get to go

[01:26:17.660 --> 01:26:21.740]
non-directional in the daytime even in Tampa even Lassiter can hear it every day

[01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:25.320]
and steal my material fresh every day instead of getting its second hand

[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:29.340]
and it's kind of interesting if you add up the numbers from our station and IOD

[01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:33.520]
and W.S. and midday now in this latest rating book it's 16% of the audience

[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:39.520]
whereas before when there was only sandy and l basically on in midday between

[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:46.440]
them they did about six seven percent put together six to seven percent so we

[01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:51.060]
have more than doubled the talk list newship during this day part

[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:57.480]
does that mean anything no I'm sorry okay excuse me my amy hello

[01:26:58.660 --> 01:27:05.100]
hello yes I just wanted to say to keep up the good work I have you people on I

[01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:10.220]
don't even gain my doubt twenty four hours a day and the only I'm doing is getting

[01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:15.120]
bags out of the eyes yeah well they're a lot of bags in this town sir

[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:19.860]
right I understand perfectly but you're doing a wonderful job and I only hope to

[01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:24.840]
keep up the good work okay thank you Davey hello hi Neil hi I have a couple

[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:28.860]
of questions about the rating system and how it works maybe you can clear me up on it

[01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:33.960]
what is the latest time of day that the ratings actually go towards I mean they

[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:36.640]
don't go into the midnight hour oh sure they're 24 hours a day

[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:40.640]
other 24 hours a day and they are listed hour by hour which we don't have the whole

[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:44.320]
book yet they won't be out for a couple of days but they are listed hour by hour

[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:48.640]
true the midnight hour till one in the morning because I'm just curious I mean I'm

[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:54.680]
not a big fan of you know talk net are just picking up a pot and receiving it now

[01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:58.140]
I enjoyed it much better before when you actually had someone there in the evening

[01:27:58.140 --> 01:28:01.060]
right when Bill Carter was here I agree with you I was wondering if they could

[01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:04.680]
if there's a difference in the books between I mean if the rating is just a

[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:09.380]
five okay that's one thing but I'm just wondering if it's justifiable or not

[01:28:09.940 --> 01:28:13.800]
as far as money is concerned well I see that's a big problem and even when I was

[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:17.040]
on from eight to midnight and I had great numbers at night for years but always

[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:21.680]
the story was well we can't sell nighttime and the problem is that advertisers in

[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:26.960]
this market and agencies especially do not want to buy after seven p.m.

[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:31.620]
which is unfortunate because you know I used to have a very large audience at

[01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:35.060]
night and the bill had a big audience at night in fact his midnight hour he had

[01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:40.220]
like an 11 share in his last book on this station but you know it's very

[01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:44.480]
difficult to retrain old dogs to do new tricks yeah I have another quick question

[01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:48.980]
about the rating system to now you have a nine is your rating correct right

[01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:53.400]
for this last book right now what percentage of that rating can you contribute

[01:28:53.980 --> 01:28:58.920]
to yourself how much would actually go towards the cackel and how much would

[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:02.600]
Kyle take out of that nine percent okay I think probably the cackel has about eight

[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:09.080]
percent you're kidding me I hope so yeah because I you know I mean a show isn't

[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:13.000]
just one person it's the whole concept and your whole show during that time period

[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:18.140]
no question about it that's it keep up the good work thanks a lot

[01:29:19.460 --> 01:29:23.100]
yeah the writers all those people to write our material we don't have any

[01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:27.540]
but see that's the one thing that astonishes me is they give us nothing I was

[01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:31.000]
talking to Stan last night we're having one of those on the phone bitching

[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:34.280]
sessions that people in this business love to have and I was saying you know what

[01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:41.020]
are they give us nothing I mentioned that I said it took me Stan was very

[01:29:41.020 --> 01:29:44.940]
fortunate in days I don't know what it is with major but you notice how the

[01:29:44.940 --> 01:29:47.880]
first day before even went on the air Rick Edwards was in here with the boom

[01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:51.960]
Mike and they brought that stupid old Mike and they messed up my show and you

[01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:54.900]
know they were running around with all this equipment took me months to get the

[01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:58.860]
first cart rack in here for all of these crazy things that we play on the air

[01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:02.660]
majors here for like a couple of weeks in bingo look at this we got a second

[01:30:02.660 --> 01:30:06.460]
cart rack for all of his stuff for I want to be Don Johnson and all I can Madonna

[01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:17.580]
this man has got a sense of humor you know I just realized he deserves to be on

[01:30:17.580 --> 01:30:21.620]
between six and seven you know that he deserves that every night just slowly

[01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:25.240]
but surely each evening his credibility is just you remember that thing that the

[01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:28.460]
Max was carrying around before that had Zeta on it that was pretending to be a

[01:30:28.460 --> 01:30:33.540]
sink but looked like some other something else you'd find I'm telling you just

[01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:40.100]
kind of like the tidie bull man just swimming away exactly and between six and

[01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:43.360]
seven I think for one of those tears I'm not sure but I'm not supposed to talk

[01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:47.420]
about that okay all of a sudden I have this sick literally the sick feeling in the

[01:30:47.420 --> 01:30:53.900]
pythomis stomach I am sick to my stomach I'm nauseous wait a minute the

[01:30:53.900 --> 01:31:00.660]
island queen said that Rick and suds said that Saturday the vulture and Lee had

[01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:13.600]
lunch Lee who fouler Lee fouler had lunch with the vulture you have got to be pulling

[01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:22.680]
my beak are you serious Lee fouler had lunch with the vulture on Saturday now

[01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:25.680]
what could that be all about I have noticed that he's been acting pretty

[01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:29.400]
bizarre this week so that we better check that out we ought to start our own

[01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:33.340]
rumor line and find out what that's all about probably something they arranged at the

[01:31:33.340 --> 01:31:38.320]
softball game though that right wonder how much he's getting paid off the

[01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:45.600]
vulture super spy okay Mike Wolf is here with the headlines world news from CBS

[01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:51.260]
at noon and we'll come back with more award-winning birds at 1206 so a little

[01:31:51.260 --> 01:31:58.320]
bit better right right so just send us your name and address you don't even have to

[01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:02.980]
put in the stamped envelope and we'll use our own we'll use those old 95

[01:32:02.980 --> 01:32:07.320]
I and Z envelopes that they refuse do you know this is an interesting story okay

[01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:11.380]
this company has no gripes coming when we do this kind of thing it's not like we

[01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:14.880]
have a shortage of envelopes we have seven million four hundred thousand and

[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:20.440]
six envelopes that say 95 I and Z and I imagine a couple of letter heads along

[01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:24.260]
with them to right and they won't let us use them because the embarrassment

[01:32:24.260 --> 01:32:29.260]
factor is too great well there is no more 95 I and Z it's now of course Zeta

[01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:36.540]
94.9236 and if you can remember all those numbers see that's the problem they

[01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:39.400]
have a few listeners but they can't remember all of those numbers so they can

[01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:46.220]
write it down in the appropriate book I love those stations that every rating

[01:32:46.220 --> 01:32:52.740]
period you know write it down right that's that is so crass and so disgusting do you

[01:32:52.740 --> 01:32:56.080]
buddy out there writes it down because somebody on the earth says write it down

[01:32:56.080 --> 01:33:03.400]
of course not and it sounds like hell it is so it comes across so bad but of course

[01:33:03.400 --> 01:33:11.680]

think up something good because everybody believes it now that you and Lee Fowler

[01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:55.860]
had launched on Saturday probably being paid off to be a spy who a spy who

[01:34:57.140 --> 01:35:01.860]
said wait a minute doesn't that sound of the vulture sound like a spy to you it

[01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:06.740]

[01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:11.940]
at home Saturday afternoon mining my own business yeah bothering nobody and

[01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:17.260]
how many witnesses you have to confirm this nobody I was by myself see he has

[01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:22.700]
unsubstantiated testimony bring Arthur Arthur Lyman is going to come in he has a few

[01:35:22.700 --> 01:35:27.800]
questions he'd like to ask you Mr. Hill who said I had lunch with him that's

[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:33.220]
what I want to know who is spreading this militant spots well there you go consider

[01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:38.140]
the source what do you mean Rick and Spud that's the message it called me is

[01:35:38.140 --> 01:35:41.800]
they my right that's the message we have that Rick and Spud they said this on the

[01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:47.580]
year on the air tell them not to call the station ever again they didn't call

[01:35:47.580 --> 01:35:51.220]
somebody who heard it called it all is that right you heard them saying that on the

[01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:57.220]
air oh boy they're wrong they're absolutely wrong and I deny it in

[01:35:57.220 --> 01:36:01.260]
fact it was from that same station I think we have a tape of the call it's a lie I

[01:36:01.260 --> 01:36:05.240]
am not a Nazi yeah that should give you an idea of who it was exactly what they're

[01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:09.920]
wrong and I vehemiles see he's not no you're not vehemently denying it because I know you

[01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:15.300]
too well now and it's kind of a lukewarm denial so that beyond the shadow of a

[01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:20.240]
doubt indicates it's true a I would not break bread with that man first off he

[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:24.980]
hurts my ears when he talks yeah and I think he's going deaf is why he talks a lot

[01:36:24.980 --> 01:36:29.500]
and I think we should take up a collection to buy leaf out there a miracle ear I

[01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:33.020]
really do I think it would be a good thing for a miracle rear

[01:36:37.780 --> 01:36:43.840]
well leaf I don't know if I can muster a post is absolutely untrue you post

[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:49.900]
a scream it what do you think what do you think now I want to tell you

[01:36:49.900 --> 01:36:54.940]
something that's going to really get you depressed what what our management I

[01:36:54.940 --> 01:36:59.920]
mean upper level management told me this morning oh god that he thinks that Jeff

[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:05.780]
Charles is real competition and I tried for 15 minutes in the middle of the rest of

[01:37:05.780 --> 01:37:10.320]
what I was trying to tell him to tell him that this man is so bad that it's

[01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:14.560]
embarrassing in addition to which he cannot buy a call every time I turn him on

[01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:18.680]
if stand goes into one of those rare commercial breaks I punch over to

[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:24.920]
seven ninety he can't buy a call and he keeps pumping those numbers and pumping

[01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:29.060]
the numbers come on you want to talk to us call those numbers they don't want to

[01:37:29.060 --> 01:37:33.580]
talk to him see Ron sax had an annoying voice Ron sounded kind of like the

[01:37:33.580 --> 01:37:39.640]
culture okay but at least he had some semblance he had an IQ of over one not very much

[01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:45.620]
over but an IQ of over one but this guy has nothing there is nothing there

[01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:49.720]
there is no substance well there may be a substance but it's one of those that

[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:58.840]
we can't mention on the air yeah you know I I have speaking of the dog kicking up

[01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:02.780]
its hind legs in the lawn we mentioned that earlier in the show so you have to

[01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:06.000]
kind of keep in mind all of the different things that we touch on during the show

[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:11.180]
and then sooner or later they come back and fit in perfectly I've always said that

[01:38:11.180 --> 01:38:19.580]
yeah if you listen to the show in total in total you also notice that I was told

[01:38:19.580 --> 01:38:22.900]
the same mong brain that gave me my lecture yesterday

[01:38:22.900 --> 01:38:29.720]

[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:57.380]

you've got the highest rated show now if they would bring me in the rest of the

[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:11.380]
numbers I'll go out and I'll you would go out like the 25 to 54 is because obviously

[01:48:11.380 --> 01:48:14.780]

[01:48:14.780 --> 01:48:18.960]

[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:23.740]
way here I'll get the numbers and I'd also like the date parts all right okay

[01:48:23.740 --> 01:48:27.140]

[01:48:27.820 --> 01:48:31.880]
information here I'll be happy to do what to whom and when I'll be happy to go

[01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:35.320]
out and bother our man and I would also like to be able to see if there's any other

[01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:39.380]
show I kind of doubted because there's a certain morning banana mouth who was

[01:48:39.380 --> 01:48:43.240]
talking the other day I didn't hear it but I understand I already has more

[01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:48.280]
listeners than I have that's right now I kind of wonder now what did Y100 do I don't

[01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:51.880]
want to make it down they were down they were down Fox's name on the air but I have a

[01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:56.540]
feeling that he didn't do no nine in the morning okay because overall they did

[01:48:56.540 --> 01:49:01.800]
a four five right they were down from a four nine I do think sunny did a nine in

[01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:05.860]
the morning I want to compare his numbers with Bill Tanner's yeah Tanner I'm sure

[01:49:05.860 --> 01:49:08.520]
must have beat him this time you think so because they were up way up they went

[01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:12.480]
over five four the closest station to us I think in the morning yeah powerless

[01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:15.120]
90 I think you're right I think they're number three

[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:22.920]
soggers and Tanner you laughing about the big guns in the markets

[01:49:23.420 --> 01:49:27.000]
you hear what we can say it or do you hear what you tell it that's the kind of

[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:30.520]
stuff that we strive for we spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to try and

[01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:36.860]
make that happen and of course you're not that's that's the way it goes in the big

[01:49:36.860 --> 01:49:42.800]
city right I'm gonna go find a please I'm gonna go stand around the water cooler

[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:46.140]

[01:49:46.140 --> 01:49:48.740]
right okay we'll do something useful and go give me the rest of the numbers

[01:49:48.740 --> 01:49:52.520]
because I was lucky they brought these in because they're not too happy with me

[01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:56.700]
these days I'm doing too well didn't I say that a few weeks ago on the air when

[01:49:56.700 --> 01:49:59.440]
you start doing too well you become a little independent and then they can't

[01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:03.280]
boss you around and manipulate you and bring you in and brow beach you and so on

[01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:07.660]
okay 23 minutes past noon at W Y and Z I promise when we come back we might take

[01:50:07.660 --> 01:50:14.020]

[01:50:27.580 --> 01:50:32.240]
record collection of the day and I found a sound effects record and on it it has

[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:37.480]
authentic vulture sounds I can't wait

[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:41.860]

all fantastic boy that's perfect for us the tweeting birds

[01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:53.660]

in the building which gets him nervous to begin with and we've had many misfits

[01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:25.420]
on the phone that I notice he's becoming apoplectic about so you have no

[01:51:25.420 --> 01:51:28.480]
concept of what he goes through up there you just you can't even begin to

[01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:33.780]

[01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:38.320]

[01:52:08.260 --> 01:52:12.200]
of open lines I don't you know I don't know what the problem is it is lunchtime

[01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:20.640]
in date county 6 to 4 9400 and embrowered 524 9400 fort Lauderdale hello

[01:52:21.660 --> 01:52:26.540]
hello yes sir how are you good how you doing I'm not too bad I just want to call you

[01:52:26.540 --> 01:52:30.460]
and tell you that during the Iran country hearings I was listening to your show

[01:52:30.460 --> 01:52:35.740]
now actually to the to the hearings and then afterwards I got kind of hooked on listen to

[01:52:35.740 --> 01:52:43.720]
a m talk radio great and it's been years since I've listened to a m but I think there's been

[01:52:43.720 --> 01:52:47.840]
an advancement in the quality of the sound because my radio picks it up really

[01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:53.400]
well and now I'm I'm converted I listen to a m all the time fantastic and I just want

[01:52:53.400 --> 01:52:57.420]
to tell you that you're doing a super job and I listen to a stand in the afternoon

[01:52:57.420 --> 01:53:05.840]
and he was talking yesterday about you keeping him from getting dates and what seems

[01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:09.720]
to me like he does a good job by himself wait a minute this is interesting because

[01:53:09.720 --> 01:53:15.840]
Stan is one of those who likes to trans he likes to place blame on others for his own

[01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:20.500]
failings for example how many times have you heard him say that I glenn or

[01:53:20.500 --> 01:53:24.420]
Neil gave him some stiff subject that didn't work out and that's why he wasn't

[01:53:24.420 --> 01:53:30.200]
doing any response you heard him yeah yeah exactly exactly and now he's blaming

[01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:35.640]
me for him not getting dates yeah he said that he was out with a young lady or maybe

[01:53:35.640 --> 01:53:42.700]
not a young lady I he was out with a lady about eleven and he said that her parents

[01:53:42.700 --> 01:53:51.300]
told her that she could not go out with him anymore because they knew you and any

[01:53:51.300 --> 01:53:56.280]
friend of Neil Rogers he could not go out with okay now isn't it interesting I

[01:53:56.280 --> 01:54:00.960]
can take a little bit of the truth and you can just you know mess it all up he never

[01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:04.300]
he never went out with this young lady this young lady isn't any more interested

[01:54:04.300 --> 01:54:10.560]
in him then she is in the frogs that croak in his pond okay but but Stan and I've

[01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:15.220]
known him for a long time and he's a great guy but he has this ability to create

[01:54:15.220 --> 01:54:21.820]
these fantasy for example if some attract if you were walking into mall and for

[01:54:21.820 --> 01:54:26.300]
whatever reason uh... you went into a shop and a young lady in the shop said hi

[01:54:26.300 --> 01:54:29.320]
how you doing or something and then you walked out of there and you thought boy she's

[01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:33.780]
in love with me and I'm gonna leave her my phone number you know based on nothing you see

[01:54:33.780 --> 01:54:38.520]
what I'm saying and Stan has this amazing facility to do that to take nothing

[01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:43.300]
and in his own mind to transpose it into this incredible romantic interlude

[01:54:43.300 --> 01:54:45.040]
that with nothing is going on

[01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:49.940]
i'm saying i'm not exaggerating it's true so i guess it makes for a fantastic

[01:54:49.940 --> 01:54:52.920]
vicarious romance life but that's about it

[01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:54.900]
well he's misleading is listeners that

[01:54:54.900 --> 01:54:57.460]
i would hear all of the right there waiting

[01:54:57.460 --> 01:55:01.840]
with baited breath to hear about this guy's love life and he starts talking about

[01:55:01.840 --> 01:55:06.460]
how he's got this guy right where he wants her and then you go and screw up his

[01:55:06.460 --> 01:55:10.160]
love life yeah okay well i'm responsible for all the other bad things that

[01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:12.080]
happens well i'll take the fall for it

[01:55:12.900 --> 01:55:15.940]
it's good talking to you and i really like you show thanks for calling

[01:55:15.940 --> 01:55:16.660]
bye bye

[01:55:16.660 --> 01:55:20.560]
another message on the screen a woman said that ray charles is asking for calls

[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:25.160]
from people who want mason freed and i guess he's trying to be a natural quinella

[01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:29.940]
with foulers the one who did about seventeen shows on a guy in california and i can

[01:55:29.940 --> 01:55:33.060]
never think of that guy's name you know his name the one that cut the girl

[01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:33.920]
no he cut up

[01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:36.720]
rape that fourteen year old girl and cut her arms off

[01:55:37.260 --> 01:55:41.060]
and uh... finally got parole from jail and everybody because nobody wants him in

[01:55:41.060 --> 01:55:44.980]
the neighborhood and the founder to about seven shows defending the guy and

[01:55:44.980 --> 01:55:48.300]
the talking about how mean the public was because you know nobody wanted to give

[01:55:48.300 --> 01:55:49.100]
this guy break

[01:55:49.720 --> 01:55:53.460]
and now evidently a ray charles is desperate enough i mean you talk about trying

[01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:55.520]
to be outrageous talk about being desperate

[01:55:55.520 --> 01:55:59.500]
and it's so obvious you know to come on here and say something so outrageous

[01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:02.800]
that you're going to get everybody crazy and the most embarrassing part about

[01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:04.520]
that is to still not get a call

[01:56:05.800 --> 01:56:08.860]
it's it's it would be like coming on here and saying i think all little children

[01:56:08.860 --> 01:56:10.960]
ought to be put in in uh...

[01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:11.760]
garbage disposal

[01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:16.400]
and you look at the phone and nothing is happening and i'm sure a lot of you have

[01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:19.620]
seen that bit on tv you know where the guy is doing the talk show and he just

[01:56:20.420 --> 01:56:23.400]
everything and then the phone finally rings and it's a wrong number

[01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:29.520]
so if you want to talk to ray charles about charlie mason the number in date is three

[01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:35.000]
seven nine eight two five five and in brown three eight nine eight two five five

[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:36.840]
come on light up his phone to give him some action

[01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:41.040]
because we understand through upper level management that the guy is a

[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:43.080]
legitimate competitor

[01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:47.040]
for what i'm not sure but legitimate competitor

[01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:49.160]
let's go to a coconut grove hello

[01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:51.640]
graduations and numbers now thank you

[01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:53.980]
i incidentally have you heard the latest

[01:56:53.980 --> 01:56:54.720]
the story

[01:56:55.480 --> 01:56:56.520]
is there a new one

[01:56:56.520 --> 01:57:00.700]
it i heard the one about uh... the plane with a hundred and forty four people

[01:57:00.700 --> 01:57:03.240]
on board that landed in both wheels blew out is that the one

[01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:05.840]
there was another one that there was an Atlanta

[01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:08.220]
this happening to land also

[01:57:08.220 --> 01:57:10.540]
the plane was getting the urge to take off

[01:57:10.540 --> 01:57:13.100]
and uh...

[01:57:13.100 --> 01:57:15.720]
there was a bag of time with that locked in the bag of

[01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:16.620]
the plan

[01:57:17.340 --> 01:57:20.420]
lady kept her in something under her feet

[01:57:26.860 --> 01:57:27.260]
and

[01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:28.920]
and

[01:57:29.860 --> 01:57:30.260]
and

[01:57:30.260 --> 01:57:30.480]
and

[01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:30.480]

[01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:30.640]
and

[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:33.880]
and every day you see one of that same dumb looking spokesman for delta

[01:57:34.420 --> 01:57:37.700]
and he says we have no explanation it's human error and there's you know

[01:57:37.700 --> 01:57:41.040]
i'm telling you they might know what those people are on but they must be doing

[01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:42.280]
some wild stuff at delta

[01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:45.180]
uh... i don't know about the battle about his

[01:57:45.180 --> 01:57:45.840]
and i

[01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:46.420]
and i just

[01:57:46.420 --> 01:57:47.000]
i just

[01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:52.580]
i've never had any major problem with eastern i know that a lot of people have but i

[01:57:52.580 --> 01:57:53.560]
mean i guess i've been lucky

[01:57:53.560 --> 01:57:58.040]
but my one experience with delta was so bad that i wouldn't fly i would walk

[01:57:58.040 --> 01:57:59.660]
before i would fly them again

[01:58:00.300 --> 01:58:03.420]
i've never flown them and i don't think that this one ever will

[01:58:03.420 --> 01:58:05.660]
no this would not be a good time to start i guess

[01:58:06.260 --> 01:58:06.700]
okay

[01:58:07.420 --> 01:58:08.920]
i'll see in a baggage compartment

[01:58:09.620 --> 01:58:10.060]
okay

[01:58:11.540 --> 01:58:14.620]
and you know the crazy part about these theories is that they're true

[01:58:14.620 --> 01:58:17.020]
you know somebody wrote a satire about an airline

[01:58:17.560 --> 01:58:21.700]
and uh... you know pilots were taking off with doors unlocked and they were landing at the wrong

[01:58:21.700 --> 01:58:24.180]
airport in the wrong city or on the wrong work runway

[01:58:24.180 --> 01:58:25.860]
uh... you know it would be funny

[01:58:26.860 --> 01:58:29.620]
but it ain't so funny when it's true as uh...

[01:58:29.620 --> 01:58:31.360]
William Conrad would say for fp and l

[01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:34.400]
okay we have an open line in date six two four ninety four hundred

[01:58:34.400 --> 01:58:38.980]
and in brow there's one line at five two four ninety four hundred if you'd like to talk about whether or not

[01:58:38.980 --> 01:58:41.640]
Charles Manson should be freed from prison

[01:58:41.640 --> 01:58:43.580]
let's go to fort lauderdale hello

[01:58:43.580 --> 01:58:46.620]
hi hi congratulations thank you

[01:58:46.620 --> 01:58:49.560]
we'd be very happy in fort lauderdale all the time

[01:58:49.560 --> 01:58:50.580]
sitting around with you

[01:58:51.400 --> 01:58:56.480]
but i just want to congratulate myself for having a good taste for listening to you for at least eight years

[01:58:56.480 --> 01:58:57.960]
well you see you're not the only one

[01:58:57.960 --> 01:59:00.200]
no absolutely i'm not the only one

[01:59:00.200 --> 01:59:01.580]
which vindicates you

[01:59:02.540 --> 01:59:02.880]
what?

[01:59:03.340 --> 01:59:04.380]
which vindicates you

[01:59:04.380 --> 01:59:05.540]
oh all right

[01:59:05.540 --> 01:59:09.860]
i heard you got the picture of the polpia today that i sent you

[01:59:09.860 --> 01:59:10.200]
yeah

[01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:11.240]
did you like that?

[01:59:11.340 --> 01:59:13.600]
it was great the one with the bird and the dropings

[01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:14.500]
aching poplops

[01:59:14.500 --> 01:59:15.200]
it was excellent

[01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:16.940]
in fact you know what those almost looked like

[01:59:16.940 --> 01:59:19.920]
those look like those burger bundles that they got at burger king now

[01:59:19.920 --> 01:59:24.720]
they didn't have any cheese on them but they looked like those little burger bundles

[01:59:25.320 --> 01:59:28.400]
i could do a whole show on burger king and the burger bundles

[01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:31.000]
you know it's just amazing to me have you seen the size of those things?

[01:59:31.420 --> 01:59:33.140]
uh... no i've only seen them on television

[01:59:33.140 --> 01:59:36.460]
oh man i mean they are so tiny that they're almost microscopic

[01:59:36.460 --> 01:59:38.940]
i don't understand why they're doing that

[01:59:38.940 --> 01:59:41.000]
i'm not saying this is only a one

[01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:46.020]
no this is their answer to royal castle and crystal and white castle and all

[01:59:46.020 --> 01:59:49.080]
the people like those little you remember those little the good ones

[01:59:49.080 --> 01:59:49.380]
yeah

[01:59:49.380 --> 01:59:52.840]
and this is their answer to them and i'm telling you they are so bad that it's

[01:59:52.840 --> 01:59:53.320]
unbelievable

[01:59:53.940 --> 01:59:56.840]
i have a new stand for us

[01:59:56.840 --> 02:00:01.460]
because we are we're going to make some money on the pope

[02:00:01.460 --> 02:00:03.300]
they're selling bags of dirt

[02:00:03.300 --> 02:00:07.100]
a couple down the street that want to build a new swimming pool and they have

[02:00:07.100 --> 02:00:11.260]
given me carp launch to their backyard dig up all the dirt i want

[02:00:11.260 --> 02:00:15.420]
and so i figured we could go down there and sell bags of dirt

[02:00:15.420 --> 02:00:18.840]
when the pope comes and some dirt bags too that i like to get rid of

[02:00:18.840 --> 02:00:22.460]
around here and all and makes money on it

[02:00:22.460 --> 02:00:23.620]
that appeal to?

[02:00:25.100 --> 02:00:26.140]
sound sensational

[02:00:27.700 --> 02:00:29.860]
the polls don't work

[02:00:29.860 --> 02:00:32.100]
and uh...

[02:00:33.080 --> 02:00:35.140]
well we think about it

[02:00:35.140 --> 02:00:36.800]
and a note esponial

[02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:38.200]
ok when is this

[02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:38.760]
and gradually

[02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:39.860]
when is that this?

[02:00:39.940 --> 02:00:40.920]
and when is that is

[02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:42.720]
ok a mobile man wanted to hear

[02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:43.300]
fowler

[02:00:45.420 --> 02:00:46.700]
fowlers versus ours

[02:00:46.700 --> 02:00:50.060]
what the numbers we don't have the hour by hour they don't come in until

[02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:52.900]
what about probably Friday?

[02:00:53.820 --> 02:00:54.100]
Friday

[02:00:54.100 --> 02:00:57.380]
so if you want hour by hour numbers you'll have to wait till the entire

[02:00:57.380 --> 02:00:58.580]
rating book comes in

[02:00:59.140 --> 02:01:03.140]
but from ten a.m. to three p.m. which is kind of a spillover

[02:01:03.140 --> 02:01:04.660]
w.s. news was in last place

[02:01:04.660 --> 02:01:06.740]
of the three news and talk

[02:01:06.740 --> 02:01:08.320]

[02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:16.080]
w.i.o.d. had a three point six and w.n.w.s. had a three point three

[02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:17.380]
a distant last

[02:01:18.360 --> 02:01:19.960]
pulling up the rear

[02:01:20.980 --> 02:01:22.540]
let's go to cutler Ridge hello

[02:01:23.140 --> 02:01:23.400]
hello

[02:01:23.400 --> 02:01:24.940]
hi how you doing?

[02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:27.760]
fine i'm the first time caller here

[02:01:27.760 --> 02:01:29.940]
and i've been listening to you about a month

[02:01:29.940 --> 02:01:32.780]
and didn't before you went on vacation

[02:01:32.780 --> 02:01:34.480]
why aren't you for the cubans?

[02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:36.800]
what do you mean for the cubans?

[02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:37.380]
what does that mean?

[02:01:37.480 --> 02:01:40.460]
everybody just vote to make it

[02:01:40.460 --> 02:01:42.340]
speak Spanish

[02:01:43.720 --> 02:01:44.300]
what?

[02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:47.280]
in cutler Ridge where i live

[02:01:47.940 --> 02:01:51.100]
no no wait a minute wait a minute everybody vote to make a speak Spanish

[02:01:51.100 --> 02:01:52.300]
what are you talking about?

[02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:53.940]
well you were firm

[02:01:53.940 --> 02:01:56.860]
no i'm not for everybody speaking Spanish

[02:01:56.860 --> 02:01:58.780]
i'm for english and i always have been

[02:01:58.780 --> 02:02:01.020]
and i noticed by the way i'm glad you mentioned that because i forgot

[02:02:01.020 --> 02:02:05.220]
on the news earlier that the metro commission and their infinite stupidity

[02:02:05.220 --> 02:02:11.220]
is going to put this thing on the ballot again so we can be sure that we're going to have another big divisive thing all over again

[02:02:11.220 --> 02:02:12.280]
isn't that great?

[02:02:12.500 --> 02:02:15.120]
because they're too spineless to tell George Valdez

[02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:19.480]
to stick it where the moon don't shine we're going to have to go through another big divisive campaign

[02:02:19.480 --> 02:02:21.740]
and another big divisive election

[02:02:21.740 --> 02:02:24.780]
well i've been in my amy 25 years

[02:02:24.780 --> 02:02:27.920]
and i think it's a great city

[02:02:28.800 --> 02:02:31.500]
you know as compared as compared to what old just

[02:02:31.500 --> 02:02:33.200]
no compared to new york

[02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:36.420]
no no it's not a great city compared to new york

[02:02:36.420 --> 02:02:38.080]
i mean you're entitled to that opinion

[02:02:38.080 --> 02:02:39.680]
based on what?

[02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:42.880]
more down here you find out more down here than you do in new york

[02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:45.920]
oh yeah from all the great newspapers here you have so much information here

[02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:52.300]
it's such an intellectual uh... you know bastion here i mean what are you talking about you find out more what does that mean?

[02:02:52.300 --> 02:02:56.500]
they let everything out down here they tell you what's going on down here

[02:02:56.500 --> 02:02:57.020]
like what?

[02:02:57.320 --> 02:02:59.080]
like everything about the drugs

[02:02:59.080 --> 02:03:03.500]
oh yeah right everybody knows all about where the drug sure everything is great

[02:03:03.500 --> 02:03:05.100]
but it's great down here

[02:03:05.100 --> 02:03:07.700]
yeah it's better down here than up north

[02:03:07.700 --> 02:03:08.260]
mm-hmm

[02:03:08.260 --> 02:03:10.640]
the weather is better here than up north

[02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:14.100]
don't let me say it again the weather is better here than up north

[02:03:14.100 --> 02:03:14.600]
period

[02:03:14.600 --> 02:03:15.560]
no period

[02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:17.300]
it's great living down here

[02:03:17.300 --> 02:03:19.760]
right because because the weather is better

[02:03:19.760 --> 02:03:21.020]
it shouldn't be down here

[02:03:21.020 --> 02:03:21.460]
mm-hmm

[02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:25.380]
click here she goes cutler ridge

[02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:29.820]
i tell you there are a lot of real neanderthals down here in that cutler ridge perinery a boil

[02:03:29.820 --> 02:03:32.120]
and there's some nice people you know five or six

[02:03:32.120 --> 02:03:36.840]
but that's another one of those vast redneck wastelands of date county

[02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:40.740]
21 till one at wionz we have two open lines are both indeed

[02:03:42.900 --> 02:03:43.360]
6249400

[02:03:45.100 --> 02:03:47.840]
6249400 and we be going to north Miami next hello

[02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:51.640]
you should make that last call or listen to Ray Charles three weeks straight

[02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:55.140]
yeah we should tie her into a chair with a radio on as loud as it'll go

[02:03:55.140 --> 02:03:59.780]
I mean there is so much humor in that Ray Charles I mean you could cut out this or just his laugh

[02:03:59.780 --> 02:04:03.040]
forget about the voltage his laugh is unbelievable

[02:04:03.040 --> 02:04:07.600]
I'm glad you mention that because the vulture gets a lot of heat from the audience for his cackel

[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:10.060]
and I the first time I heard Ray Charles and I heard that

[02:04:10.540 --> 02:04:11.940]
that hyena laugh

[02:04:11.940 --> 02:04:15.580]
well well well it's incredible that laugh I couldn't believe it

[02:04:15.580 --> 02:04:19.580]
I mean he did he came on today with with a subject that just so talk about

[02:04:19.580 --> 02:04:24.220]
contrived I mean that subject today I think mansions should be let free

[02:04:24.220 --> 02:04:28.200]
yeah well you see this is the guy's idea of being outrageous is to come on a

[02:04:28.200 --> 02:04:32.840]
year and to desperately start lashing out and everything and anything with you

[02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:37.940]
know these obvious attempts to get the audience hysterical and just not going to work

[02:04:37.940 --> 02:04:40.520]
because like you see you see through it in five seconds

[02:04:40.520 --> 02:04:44.180]
I mean who's responsible for this guy?

[02:04:44.460 --> 02:04:45.380]
Lee Fowler

[02:04:45.380 --> 02:04:46.900]
another winner from the Lee

[02:04:46.900 --> 02:04:50.260]
yeah well Lee is got one thing about Lee's track record man he may not be good

[02:04:50.260 --> 02:04:51.140]
but he's consistent

[02:04:51.140 --> 02:04:53.800]
now guy like this I brought him down from Minnesota right

[02:04:53.800 --> 02:04:58.200]
but did I have to get or do you think they gave this guy a contract or they obligated

[02:04:58.200 --> 02:04:58.720]
to this guy?

[02:04:59.040 --> 02:05:00.640]
I have no idea I don't know

[02:05:00.640 --> 02:05:05.940]
I one thing that I've always I really was down on on the vulture

[02:05:05.940 --> 02:05:09.140]
till the other day when I heard him do Lee Fowler screaming

[02:05:09.140 --> 02:05:14.020]
his best act for sure and I thought of a conversation between you doing

[02:05:14.020 --> 02:05:16.700]
great worthings and him doing Fowler

[02:05:16.700 --> 02:05:21.540]
but monitoring him for something or other and I would be think that a big star

[02:05:21.540 --> 02:05:22.740]
okay we'll work on that

[02:05:22.740 --> 02:05:24.220]
okay you thanks a lot

[02:05:24.880 --> 02:05:28.080]
okay yes so what do you think Charles Manson should we let him in or keep him

[02:05:28.080 --> 02:05:29.000]
keep him out

[02:05:34.480 --> 02:05:39.400]
and what about Jerry Koch or and what about Stacon shake I hear they're all closing up

[02:05:41.620 --> 02:05:45.840]
you see I really have no idea what this business is all about in fact that was my first question

[02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:48.880]
to our general manager this morning is what the hell is this all about you know

[02:05:48.880 --> 02:05:50.540]
when you tell me what is it all about

[02:05:51.540 --> 02:05:54.720]
and after an hour I realized that he didn't know any more than I do

[02:05:54.720 --> 02:05:57.740]
19 before one and wins let's go to Miami Lakes hello

[02:05:57.740 --> 02:06:04.240]
hello yes sir is there any good or any good fallout from all of this drug trade in Miami

[02:06:04.860 --> 02:06:10.280]
is there any good from us yes not not that I know of other you know if you're talking about individual good

[02:06:10.280 --> 02:06:14.740]
people getting wealthy and buying cars and you know buying big houses and having a lot of money

[02:06:14.740 --> 02:06:17.780]
maybe individually there's good but certainly for the community there's not

[02:06:17.780 --> 02:06:24.120]
well there is one what is that you've developed the finest trauma unit at the medical center

[02:06:24.120 --> 02:06:29.800]
in the United States thanks to all of the knife and gun society's going on isn't that great

[02:06:29.800 --> 02:06:37.400]
yeah good thing sir what a genius you what 25 to 54

[02:06:39.140 --> 02:06:43.080]
and he's very slowly zeroxing the day parts by the way did you hear the guy

[02:06:43.080 --> 02:06:48.140]
said that the Rachel's laugh vindicates you almost in other words the

[02:06:48.140 --> 02:06:52.460]
cacola is now almost commonplace because Rachel's laugh is so embarrassing

[02:06:55.980 --> 02:06:58.900]
now wait a minute what is this oh this is the weekend

[02:07:01.700 --> 02:07:07.380]

[02:07:23.020 --> 02:07:27.660]

[02:07:27.660 --> 02:07:32.780]
put you into a coma okay I mean he has brought me stuff here that is so useless

[02:07:32.780 --> 02:07:37.260]
as to make you want to just do handstands in the middle of the atrium

[02:07:39.140 --> 02:07:51.300]
isn't that something overall 25 to 54 huh huh boy W snooze is really got that

[02:07:51.300 --> 02:07:57.060]
young audience don't they I mean like almost invisible but that's on a weekend

[02:07:57.060 --> 02:08:02.060]
but he's got me even the pages oh this is also the weekend weekend weekend

[02:08:02.060 --> 02:08:06.840]
we don't care about the weekend you need andrth all all of these pages are the weekend

[02:08:08.180 --> 02:08:14.300]
oh man give us a break Helen Dale hello hello Neil hi I got a comment about that

[02:08:14.300 --> 02:08:19.060]
Delta deal yeah yeah I'm about a couple months ago when I got out of school for the summer

[02:08:19.060 --> 02:08:24.240]
I got a job working Mary I didn't fly it up in Lauderdale and you would not believe

[02:08:24.240 --> 02:08:29.180]
the stuff that goes on to the Delta planes and how unsafe they are I mean one day

[02:08:29.180 --> 02:08:35.180]
I opened the door to load the plane and the the emergency shoots shot out

[02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:43.120]
just the food is disgusting the unsanitary I mean Delta used to be the best airline

[02:08:43.120 --> 02:08:48.460]
around and you know what's happened to them you know what it ought to say you

[02:08:48.460 --> 02:08:52.080]
you see I know you're seeing those ads where it says Delta is ready where you

[02:08:52.080 --> 02:08:56.160]
when you are yeah and after the word ready somebody ought to take like a

[02:08:56.160 --> 02:09:01.320]
little mark in there and above it write the words to crash when you are

[02:09:01.320 --> 02:09:07.080]
no but like just like I'll give you a word of advice like if when you fly on any of these

[02:09:07.080 --> 02:09:12.060]
airlines like your coffee pots and stuff like that yeah when the guys go out if they're

[02:09:12.060 --> 02:09:16.080]
sure they just take the coffee pot that's come in from the wherever the plane just

[02:09:16.080 --> 02:09:22.180]
landed from and they'll just wash it in the dirty water in the dirty garbage that's

[02:09:22.180 --> 02:09:26.480]
come off the plane and just wipe it and put it right back on the airplane I mean if

[02:09:26.480 --> 02:09:31.180]
you're going to order a drink anything with a lemon or lime or ice the guys they have

[02:09:31.180 --> 02:09:35.220]
dirty hands and grease all over from being on a truck they just go ahead and make it

[02:09:35.220 --> 02:09:41.920]
up your meals are pretty safe especially if you order the what do you call it

[02:09:43.180 --> 02:09:47.700]
special meals like kosher meal vegetarian meals yeah you know but other than that

[02:09:47.700 --> 02:09:54.120]
yeah yeah I'm very selective about what I eat on a plane in fact when I was on

[02:09:54.120 --> 02:09:59.000]
vacation I was on two breakfast flights and they bring you and I'm not an egg

[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:02.660]
eater to begin with but they bring you these eggs that look like like this

[02:10:03.260 --> 02:10:08.980]
called out of a bad egg exactly like death warmed over right and I eat generally

[02:10:08.980 --> 02:10:13.080]
like things out of little packages like sometimes there's I'm trying like

[02:10:13.080 --> 02:10:17.140]
little cakes or something in packages right when when they're sealed they may be

[02:10:17.140 --> 02:10:20.520]
still but least you feel they're fairly safe they haven't been read on and

[02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:25.480]
stuff exactly exactly there anything that's sealed on there is all right it's

[02:10:25.480 --> 02:10:28.360]
that the prepared meals are pretty good because the girls prepare them in the

[02:10:28.360 --> 02:10:32.240]
kitchen and you know they're fairly clean you know what I don't understand why does

[02:10:32.240 --> 02:10:36.000]
it have to be so hard I mean we're talking about what a couple hundred people on a

[02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:41.200]
jet maybe three hundred on the biggest why is it so hard to prepare meals even

[02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:44.440]
if they took regular TV dinners they would be better than most of what they feed

[02:10:44.440 --> 02:10:49.520]
you oh yeah exactly the food is really awful I mean the one of their company

[02:10:49.520 --> 02:10:54.520]
benefits their wages were so low that's why I quit the wages were so low what they

[02:10:54.520 --> 02:10:58.580]
do they they're benefit they feed you big deal who wants to eat airline food all

[02:10:58.580 --> 02:11:02.440]
day yeah you can say that again well that's one of the ways they get even with

[02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:06.780]
you yeah really I just want to call it you know about that okay thanks a lot

[02:11:06.780 --> 02:11:13.780]
thank you okay it's 14 to one at W I N Z will not do that so I think W I O D used

[02:11:13.780 --> 02:11:18.340]
to do they yeah yeah yeah they did it of course now lately since they changed no

[02:11:18.340 --> 02:11:21.800]
lately they would not be too crazy about doing it well listen to four four and a

[02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:25.400]
half shares in a shabby they don't have they don't have a four they've got a three

[02:11:25.400 --> 02:11:30.800]
six and was that also when they had last the people on there in other words as far as

[02:11:30.800 --> 02:11:34.600]
Mike and that was that was when everybody was there which is what makes it so

[02:11:34.600 --> 02:11:38.720]
ironic is that they went up with the people that they had there with Sandy and

[02:11:38.720 --> 02:11:43.480]
Mike and Bill and now all of those people are gone they haven't improved I think the

[02:11:43.480 --> 02:11:46.800]
people the on air people have on now are worse than what they have that's my

[02:11:46.800 --> 02:11:50.760]
point that's what I'm trying to tell you so even though they went up a little

[02:11:50.760 --> 02:11:54.400]
bit to a three six they can't brag about it and they can't sell it because none of

[02:11:54.400 --> 02:11:59.100]
those people are there anymore really does management really like when you got your

[02:11:59.100 --> 02:12:03.400]
numbers in today does management sit down and look this stuff over and make

[02:12:03.400 --> 02:12:06.940]
important decisions is to who's going to remain on the air after looking at the

[02:12:06.940 --> 02:12:11.800]
stuff or not or they just say well we're down for whatever reason or so fluke

[02:12:11.800 --> 02:12:15.420]
see every time a radio station gets a lousy book but they do as they say well

[02:12:15.420 --> 02:12:18.240]
look you know barber time they don't know what they're doing the nilson draw

[02:12:18.240 --> 02:12:21.640]
face on all I don't agree with you I think the bad part of it is in this business

[02:12:21.640 --> 02:12:26.320]
in radio at least is that most management reacts from book to book which you

[02:12:26.320 --> 02:12:30.580]
really should never do one one book can be a fluke or one change can be a fluke

[02:12:30.580 --> 02:12:34.780]
this business is not a one book business it's got to be over a sustained period

[02:12:34.780 --> 02:12:38.580]
of time but unfortunately a lot of management just waits for the book come out

[02:12:38.580 --> 02:12:42.720]
then they you know start wholesale firing people and we've seen it more than once

[02:12:42.720 --> 02:12:47.340]
in the last couple of years that management has you know reacted you know and

[02:12:47.340 --> 02:12:50.160]
done wild things and for and then the book comes out and it turns out that the

[02:12:50.160 --> 02:12:53.420]
previous people were doing well and that's exactly what happened in i.o.d. their

[02:12:53.420 --> 02:12:59.120]
previous people were going up and they're all gone you know you know I happen to

[02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:03.820]
know and you can take this to think I happen to know that you for whatever

[02:13:03.820 --> 02:13:09.440]
reason make other radio stations very nervous now they never have something

[02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:13.740]
nice to say about you don't say that you've got this you've got problems you've got

[02:13:13.740 --> 02:13:19.420]
this and that but you make them feel very very nervous yeah yeah of course I do

[02:13:19.420 --> 02:13:23.120]
because I talk about them openly and honestly and I tell it like it is and they can't

[02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:27.220]
speak about that and most radio stations don't like to discuss the inside stuff

[02:13:27.220 --> 02:13:30.820]
going on things that you're in an in-house right the type thing and you just don't

[02:13:31.820 --> 02:13:35.400]
want to talk about it on the air to thousands of people and that's one of the

[02:13:35.400 --> 02:13:39.040]
reasons why all the people in the business listen to this show well they do they

[02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:42.220]
do and I think it's kind of ironic and what they do is they'll listen to you they'll

[02:13:42.220 --> 02:13:46.540]
trash you they'll indicate well this guy that what have you and then the book

[02:13:46.540 --> 02:13:49.780]
comes out and you get whatever number that you said you have what do we share they

[02:13:49.780 --> 02:13:54.680]
have for nine nine well nine is pretty big heavy duty stuff let me tell you

[02:13:54.680 --> 02:13:58.700]
something nine in the daytime in the market of this size is I don't I don't know

[02:13:58.700 --> 02:14:03.400]
how many years it's been since anybody has had a nine in this market in the day

[02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:09.000]
time I don't it's almost impossible that I'm not at twice at your radio station

[02:14:09.480 --> 02:14:14.420]
that he has more listenership than you do not anymore not anymore that's why I'm

[02:14:14.420 --> 02:14:19.200]
anxious to see the um day parts if Tweety bird ever gets his finger out of his

[02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:23.060]
ear or wherever he's got it hidden I'm really anxious to see that because if they

[02:14:23.060 --> 02:14:27.520]
did a four five or something overall there's no way that he did some humongous

[02:14:27.520 --> 02:14:30.620]
number in the morning and just very unlikely now with all your numbers with

[02:14:30.620 --> 02:14:33.500]
everything that's going well for you what not it seems like that you have less

[02:14:33.500 --> 02:14:37.840]
commercials than other radio stations true am I correct true why because in other

[02:14:37.840 --> 02:14:41.020]
words they don't think your sort of radio is marketable I haven't I haven't got

[02:14:41.020 --> 02:14:45.200]
any idea I asked our management that question this morning and unfortunately the

[02:14:45.200 --> 02:14:48.740]
sales department here has gone through a series of upheavals and the previous

[02:14:48.740 --> 02:14:52.360]
sales manager when he left before he left this station did everything of his

[02:14:52.360 --> 02:14:57.500]
power to sabotage this radio station that's not right no it's not right it is not

[02:14:57.500 --> 02:15:02.140]
professional and not perfect exactly so you know we got some good people back

[02:15:02.140 --> 02:15:06.440]
there but they are practically starting from scratch even what good are big

[02:15:06.440 --> 02:15:12.380]
numbers if in fact it's it does not precisely and actually exactly that's

[02:15:12.380 --> 02:15:17.220]
exactly what I asked this morning so we'll find out almost like I was there yeah

[02:15:17.220 --> 02:15:21.400]
almost maybe you've got one of those the bugs I don't have a but that is that's

[02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:24.220]
really one thing I don't understand I mean if the numbers are there what have you the

[02:15:24.220 --> 02:15:28.280]
ideas to transfer that into dollars you bet and I cannot transferring into

[02:15:28.280 --> 02:15:32.120]
dollars and something is wrong something is rotten in Denmark right but see I

[02:15:32.120 --> 02:15:35.060]
think the type of radio that you do and I think people are getting a little bit

[02:15:35.060 --> 02:15:40.280]
more used to it is not all that outrageous people are talking about this

[02:15:40.280 --> 02:15:45.380]
radio station no I'm out in about quite a bit and the type of radio you do is not

[02:15:45.380 --> 02:15:51.440]
that off base I agree with you it is not that great I agree and I don't I think

[02:15:51.440 --> 02:15:55.140]
it I think the type of radio you're doing is is the type of life that we all

[02:15:55.140 --> 02:15:59.580]
leave to certain extent each each and every day of our lives you got it and I

[02:15:59.580 --> 02:16:03.460]
think it's not wrong funny right listen I'm happy for you and I think it's

[02:16:03.460 --> 02:16:07.660]
great one thing you can do is get my friend Billy back from here I'd sure

[02:16:07.660 --> 02:16:12.340]
love to what's he doing what's Bill doing yeah he's taking a paycheck every

[02:16:12.340 --> 02:16:16.420]
other week oh that's right he's hanging out the November right well what the heck he'll

[02:16:16.420 --> 02:16:20.420]
be okay don't worry about okay see you later do we have another break to do we

[02:16:20.420 --> 02:16:26.620]
do another break on this show okay and when we come back old look what happened to

[02:16:26.620 --> 02:16:30.620]
the phone when you just came in the door look at that four lights are empty now

[02:16:30.620 --> 02:16:34.580]
since you just came to they can sense it they can feel you coming okay let's

[02:16:34.580 --> 02:16:38.400]
take this break and when we come back he's got all of the stuff that we don't want in

[02:16:38.400 --> 02:16:42.620]
his hand okay I want to just say one thing and again I you know people look at it

[02:16:42.620 --> 02:16:45.760]
like I'm tuning my own horn and in some extent I guess I need to because

[02:16:45.760 --> 02:16:48.940]
certainly nobody else in the market is going to come I hey Neil had this nine share

[02:16:48.940 --> 02:16:55.880]
you know the cum of this show is 198,000 people okay the cum of some

[02:16:55.880 --> 02:16:59.940]
stations in this market is considerably less I'm talking about the entire

[02:16:59.940 --> 02:17:04.220]
station okay that the cum is the total number of people that you're reaching

[02:17:06.880 --> 02:17:11.000]
unbelievable as far as sunny fox in the morning is concerned Glenn has brought me

[02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:15.800]
all of these pages some of which are right and some of which are wrong but you know

[02:17:15.800 --> 02:17:19.720]
when you're dealing with mental incompetence what do you expect now let's see why

[02:17:19.720 --> 02:17:24.720]
100 why 100 oh I see he always talks about cum because they've got that

[02:17:24.720 --> 02:17:28.480]
gigantic a cum of all these people listening like for five minutes in the

[02:17:28.480 --> 02:17:35.340]
morning okay so in cum banana mouth is right he's got 235,400 but average

[02:17:35.340 --> 02:17:42.880]
quarter hour average quarter hour is pathetic sunny 38,100 and average

[02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:52.760]
quarter hour on this show wait a minute is 63,000 almost double and that's what

[02:17:52.760 --> 02:17:56.580]
they look at that's what the agencies look at the course course like the

[02:17:56.580 --> 02:18:01.940]
listenership and you know cum mean all that means on an FM station like that is

[02:18:01.940 --> 02:18:05.200]
people punching up the button in the morning listening for five minutes sunny well

sitting in here with nothing wouldn't that have been a nice gesture instead of the

[02:21:41.620 --> 02:21:47.300]
stale cake with a douche bag on it which is such a we're such a mung brain kind of

[02:21:47.300 --> 02:21:49.700]
a thing to do you know what are they going to go out for that we don't even say

douche bag on to show much anymore right not much because we've gotten finally

[02:21:53.560 --> 02:21:58.280]
gotten rid of most of the douche bags we're here doing the work that we can say

[02:21:58.280 --> 02:22:01.420]
anything we want about them because they're at lunch all of some place no you can't

[02:22:01.420 --> 02:22:07.320]
we are not supposed to be giving it to management don't you understand that I

[02:22:07.320 --> 02:22:11.260]
was told that yesterday no uncertain terms that we have to cool it we in terms

[02:22:11.260 --> 02:22:21.300]
of this attack we we as an OUI forget it it says on the screen right get it

[02:22:23.400 --> 02:22:29.700]
so as they say at Windixie we are so well we have a couple of lines on the board we have

[02:22:29.700 --> 02:22:37.680]
one open line in Broward 524 9400 and indeed if you speak it in English 624 9400

[02:22:37.680 --> 02:22:40.520]
you did hear that they're going to put the anti-bilingual thing on the ballot

[02:22:40.520 --> 02:22:44.500]
you're kidding so we're going to have to go through all of that all over again again

[02:22:44.500 --> 02:22:48.820]
how many times we have to do this the Metro Commission every year we have

[02:22:48.820 --> 02:22:53.820]
disgusting subhuman vulgar power again we're going to put it on the ballot well

[02:22:53.820 --> 02:22:58.080]
that was on the first reading they have to do it a second time and maybe

[02:22:58.080 --> 02:23:02.200]
between now and then enough people can call them and raise hell about it as Bob

[02:23:02.200 --> 02:23:12.020]
Blaster would say how would be pressing oh South Miami you say what yeah

[02:23:12.020 --> 02:23:16.860]
two things first of all I used to work in the gallery and mall it's always been dead

[02:23:16.860 --> 02:23:21.160]
absolutely dead yeah there's no former life there right what were all those people

[02:23:21.160 --> 02:23:25.360]
lying to us about last week I have no idea I worked there for seven months and I've

[02:23:25.360 --> 02:23:28.460]
never been in a mall that you could hear your voice in from one end to the other

[02:23:28.460 --> 02:23:33.340]
exactly is like going into the Grand Canyon exactly and secondly last night my

[02:23:33.340 --> 02:23:36.940]
parents went a Delta flight that went through kind of a tornado storm heading

[02:23:36.940 --> 02:23:42.000]
into a hair and they heard engines shutting off shutting on shutting off shutting

[02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:45.900]
on when I finally got down and landed the captain came on the loud speaker

[02:23:45.900 --> 02:23:50.100]
and said everybody on board you should thank God right now we're alive because

[02:23:50.100 --> 02:23:54.660]
five more minutes and we wouldn't have made it oh boy nice thing to tell the

[02:23:54.660 --> 02:24:01.820]
passengers wow unbelievable that's it's want to let you know that little bit of

[02:24:01.820 --> 02:24:06.180]
bit of information terrific well listen words to live by right right okay see

[02:24:06.180 --> 02:24:09.720]
you later all right bye eleven after one at W.I. and Z. Don't forget Delta is

[02:24:09.720 --> 02:24:13.540]
ready when you are folks we have three open lines in date we have an epidemic of

[02:24:13.540 --> 02:24:19.060]
open lines in Dade County noise the engines will turn them off for you six two four

[02:24:20.420 --> 02:24:23.980]
ninety four hundred well it's probably true you know Rachel's is some pretty heavy

[02:24:23.980 --> 02:24:28.340]
competition now so after noon we better you know not take anything for granted

[02:24:28.340 --> 02:24:32.660]
here's a caller in bocah who needs to talk to Glenn about where is his jacket

[02:24:34.800 --> 02:24:39.580]
bocah they hung up thank God yeah so obviously that wasn't for real because if it was

[02:24:39.580 --> 02:24:42.780]
somebody in bocah who wanted their jacket they would have hung around just another

[02:24:42.780 --> 02:24:47.980]
false alarm well I guess we don't have too many people who want to talk about this

[02:24:47.980 --> 02:24:54.680]
Chuck Manson thing huh what should we let him out or keep him in what do you think

[02:24:55.580 --> 02:25:02.720]
question for you question for you get in on the action is Donna Rice telling the

[02:25:02.720 --> 02:25:09.720]
truth how big was it he hasn't taken a poll yet we do have two open lines in

[02:25:09.720 --> 02:25:13.540]

[02:32:09.040 --> 02:32:15.300]
now hi how you doing pretty good I agree with you let's see a part of the morning while

[02:32:15.300 --> 02:32:19.980]
it's driving around then I forget I had a bigger chance to get on with you and I

[02:32:19.980 --> 02:32:24.500]
agree with you that most people are in their own little dream worlds and they're in

[02:32:24.500 --> 02:32:29.160]
their own little cocoon mines yeah like in pampered pines well I'm probably one of the

[02:32:29.160 --> 02:32:33.520]
exceptions since I'm over there yeah well I used to over there I agree with you well

[02:32:33.520 --> 02:32:37.100]
that bilingual audience will probably go through now since there's only thirty-seven

[02:32:37.100 --> 02:32:40.660]
percent white so now the times probably right to have a new election we'll do it

[02:32:40.660 --> 02:32:46.260]
until we get it right yeah yeah and no at thirty-seven percent white that I mean what else could

[02:32:46.260 --> 02:32:53.200]
you vote what that I've been trying to was running actively opposed to a floor right

[02:32:53.200 --> 02:32:56.920]
over here where I distributed a thousand flyers book at the county commission meetings

[02:32:56.920 --> 02:33:02.060]
and actually you know politics either what have it yeah would go ahead and be

[02:33:02.060 --> 02:33:07.220]
funneled the minds of the ignorant by the way somebody sent me an article I should have

[02:33:07.220 --> 02:33:10.820]
saved it but I threw it out about the new base side that they're going to build in

[02:33:10.820 --> 02:33:17.200]
pampered pines seriously seriously stand is laughing this is serious I haven't seen

[02:33:17.200 --> 02:33:21.360]
it's true and this is just what we need in pampered pines is another shopping center

[02:33:21.360 --> 02:33:25.400]
yeah we don't have enough of it all my shop and centers and walk handles yeah few

[02:33:25.400 --> 02:33:30.260]
more strip shopping centers another base side and we'll be all set exactly now I've been

[02:33:30.260 --> 02:33:35.080]
trying to get get some support I got a few supporters but not enough to make any

[02:33:35.080 --> 02:33:42.340]
difference no they're brain dead over there exactly now but as far as people stand

[02:33:42.340 --> 02:33:49.080]
up for their rights as far as coming coming from New York City I seen neighborhoods

[02:33:49.080 --> 02:33:53.200]
go down the tubes where white prove down black food in is just said earlier I see

[02:33:53.200 --> 02:33:57.180]
what happens in neighborhoods and I can see that happen in an hour of a year where

[02:33:57.180 --> 02:34:00.980]
it's predominantly white and you get one or two here and there now I feel that I'm

[02:34:00.980 --> 02:34:04.700]
going to start seeing for sales signs pop up my neighborhood yeah and the lights move

[02:34:04.700 --> 02:34:09.760]
out the blacks move in but the same people liberals as you mentioned earlier the ones

[02:34:09.760 --> 02:34:13.800]
that say well they keep the house in bed to shape the most whites I have in my

[02:34:13.800 --> 02:34:18.040]
neighborhood so that may be true for that one particular person person which may be

[02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:23.200]
the exception to a rule but however if there was such desirable neighbors these

[02:34:23.200 --> 02:34:30.140]
people professing this would still the house and move to live the city and yeah I don't

[02:34:30.140 --> 02:34:34.320]
see I don't see a lot of that happening to be honest we don't see a lot of white

[02:34:34.320 --> 02:34:38.180]
middle and upper class people waiting online to move into Liberty City now that

[02:34:38.180 --> 02:34:43.000]
you mentioned it now yeah well that's more into overtown exactly people that are

[02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:48.100]
in the little hating hypocrites and yeah they just well say not big hits and

[02:34:48.100 --> 02:34:52.300]
racist their hypocrites they would they would like you and they would like for

[02:34:52.300 --> 02:34:55.200]
me to move in Liberty City but they're gonna you know they're gonna be living

[02:34:55.200 --> 02:34:59.400]
in Pembroke Lakes I feel a lot of people had a push in this and so on and so forth

[02:34:59.400 --> 02:35:04.000]
and the Jewish community staying their own little segregated area I don't see them

[02:35:04.500 --> 02:35:09.720]
race mixing or professing into racial marriages and like you said I I

[02:35:09.720 --> 02:35:16.140]
have seen papers distributed on the college campus where I have went also on my

[02:35:16.140 --> 02:35:19.980]
window from a white student union and it was also an article referenced that

[02:35:19.980 --> 02:35:25.940]
from as you would put in the title bomb giving negative publicity on it which

[02:35:25.940 --> 02:35:30.980]
I thought newspapers and coverage from whatever organization it be were covered

[02:35:30.980 --> 02:35:35.000]
under the First Amendment Freedom of Speech well you don't like it don't read it.

[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:38.020]

[02:45:34.080 --> 02:45:42.500]
elephant man's skeleton and I think he's got enough on his mind without his white glove being the object of everybody's

[02:45:42.500 --> 02:45:48.460]
ridicule I mean I would really hope that his his one goal to get the skeleton doesn't doesn't

[02:45:48.460 --> 02:45:58.020]
depress him let alone all this other talk I don't see it hello I'm here I'm looking for something he's

[02:46:56.100 --> 02:47:03.900]
that's to me is one of uh life's greatest uh pleasures nil what do you think of you think you

[02:47:03.900 --> 02:47:09.680]
really don't like pember lakes I love pember lakes beautiful places it is yeah but what they need

[02:47:09.680 --> 02:47:14.860]
there is probably like you know base side but my only quest we don't have enough shopping here yeah

[02:47:14.860 --> 02:47:18.940]
which you need a more strip shopping center I just want to know you know where how to get to the

[02:47:18.940 --> 02:47:23.080]
beach from pember lakes you can't get there you have that I don't think people realize they're in Florida

[02:47:23.860 --> 02:47:28.600]
alibrary will be on stand show at two he'll be glad to explain it to you you have to get on a plane

[02:47:28.600 --> 02:47:33.800]
without well we have a major crisis here at wins and it's a good thing for management that it's

[02:47:34.440 --> 02:47:42.540]
134 and not 10 o'clock in the morning because there seems to be a tape missing from carousel number one

[02:47:43.140 --> 02:47:49.320]
now it is possible it's not very likely but it is possible that it could be in carousel number two

[02:47:49.880 --> 02:47:55.620]
right so instead of both of you acting like dummies over there why doesn't one of you look in carousel

[02:47:55.620 --> 02:48:00.780]
number two and I'm looking in the window at the reflections of both of you perusing desperately

[02:48:01.300 --> 02:48:07.000]
and uh I have a feeling it's not there right because there were two copies of it

[02:48:07.130 --> 02:48:24.010]
you could be a major problem a serious problem developing in the next 25 minutes in fact there

[02:48:24.010 --> 02:48:33.410]
could be 25 minutes of dead air I don't care means nothing means absolutely nothing

[02:48:34.650 --> 02:48:41.770]
you found it you found it now how is it isn't it interesting that all three of us kept looking and

[02:48:41.770 --> 02:48:51.370]
looking and looking and we couldn't find it unbelievable oh oh no wonder we couldn't find no wonder

[02:48:51.370 --> 02:48:55.510]
okay now of course those of you in the audience we want you to take note that you are not hearing

[02:48:55.510 --> 02:48:57.850]
this because we are not permitted to play this on the air

[02:49:02.250 --> 02:49:07.050]
hello this is Michael Jackson urgent you to help stop the spread of social disease

[02:49:07.530 --> 02:49:11.490]
don't risk your life by having a romantic encounter with an unfamiliar queen's

[02:49:11.490 --> 02:49:16.410]
I urge you to do like I do go it alone but make sure you wear protection

[02:49:17.010 --> 02:49:22.390]
that's why I recommend the Michael Jackson glove worn on either hand the Michael Jackson glove

[02:49:22.390 --> 02:49:30.050]
add the security and kiss of mine that I need to do it myself so remember before you put it out put it on and

[02:49:32.250 --> 02:49:37.490]
the Michael Jackson glove proving once again that a bird on the hand is better than one in the bush

[02:49:37.490 --> 02:49:40.090]
a better than sequin models for extra stimulation

[02:49:53.150 --> 02:49:58.070]
oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah

[02:50:01.010 --> 02:50:04.770]

once in one gets thrown on a lot

[02:50:13.950 --> 02:50:18.910]
we've been searching for the world's power to go given the grass

[02:50:18.910 --> 02:50:22.570]

The poppin' getting higher

[02:51:37.010 --> 02:51:38.210]
It makes me so convinced

[02:51:38.790 --> 02:51:40.770]

Okay, one thirty eight of W.I.N.C. let's take some sound.

[02:52:12.350 --> 02:52:17.170]
Okay, I think your show is disgusting and it doesn't stand for anything decent.

[02:52:17.450 --> 02:52:19.530]
So why are you listening to it you misfit?

[02:52:20.030 --> 02:52:22.110]
Because I'm switching over to Steve Kane at least.

[02:52:22.210 --> 02:52:24.730]
Okay, good, okay, good for you pal.

[02:52:25.890 --> 02:52:28.490]
You're exactly the kind of listener he needs.

[02:52:29.210 --> 02:52:30.130]
A misfit.

[02:52:31.890 --> 02:52:32.850]
Do you believe that?

[02:52:34.250 --> 02:52:37.530]
I mean it's only a one forty in the afternoon and the guy was on so much grandma

[02:52:37.530 --> 02:52:39.790]
boon or boon in the box.

[02:52:40.790 --> 02:52:41.890]
Let's go to Miami.

[02:52:42.110 --> 02:52:42.270]
Hello.

[02:52:42.770 --> 02:52:43.010]
Hello?

[02:52:43.350 --> 02:52:43.550]
Yes.

[02:52:44.010 --> 02:52:49.370]
Oh, I was just calling for Senator about the fourth guy that called before me.

[02:52:50.030 --> 02:52:51.410]
I was talking about the nigga.

[02:52:52.030 --> 02:52:52.790]
About what?

[02:52:53.310 --> 02:52:53.950]
After nigga.

[02:52:53.950 --> 02:52:55.410]
No, he didn't say nigger.

[02:52:55.510 --> 02:52:57.470]
Nobody said nigger on this show until you did.

[02:52:57.490 --> 02:52:58.950]
Talking about racist, the race and the beat.

[02:52:58.970 --> 02:53:00.210]
He didn't say nigger, man.

[02:53:00.310 --> 02:53:02.850]
Okay, he was talking about between black and the white.

[02:53:03.190 --> 02:53:04.430]
Yeah, he didn't say nigger.

[02:53:04.610 --> 02:53:05.570]
Sitting all of that.

[02:53:06.290 --> 02:53:07.510]
Why did you use that word?

[02:53:08.310 --> 02:53:16.650]
Because I thought that if I'm misunderstanding still I thought he said you had a sign of on his car saying something about the name.

[02:53:16.890 --> 02:53:19.170]
I didn't hear exactly what was it.

[02:53:19.250 --> 02:53:20.370]
I just had just turned my right.

[02:53:20.370 --> 02:53:21.150]
Why don't you ask?

[02:53:21.410 --> 02:53:23.890]
You must be listening to a different show than I am.

[02:53:23.970 --> 02:53:25.550]
No, I'm not listening to this show.

[02:53:25.690 --> 02:53:32.010]
And now getting to the point that God made us all to me.

[02:53:32.110 --> 02:53:33.050]
God made us all.

[02:53:33.050 --> 02:53:33.750]
Oh, yeah, right.

[02:53:33.990 --> 02:53:35.050]
Black, blue, green.

[02:53:35.430 --> 02:53:35.650]
Yeah.

[02:53:35.830 --> 02:53:40.330]
And when this world come to an end, it's not going to be a place for the white in a place,

[02:53:40.410 --> 02:53:43.370]
place for a black and black or a place for a green or whatever.

[02:53:43.670 --> 02:53:43.850]
Yeah.

[02:53:44.150 --> 02:53:45.450]
Everybody's going to be there together.

[02:53:45.950 --> 02:53:46.190]
Yeah.

[02:53:46.190 --> 02:53:49.290]
The hardest way you want to be there or not everybody's going to be there.

[02:53:49.390 --> 02:53:50.390]
We all going to be there.

[02:53:50.530 --> 02:53:50.970]
That's right.

[02:53:51.190 --> 02:53:53.910]
We all be here now and when we die, we all be there.

[02:53:54.010 --> 02:53:55.430]
And get along here on Earth.

[02:53:55.790 --> 02:53:58.070]
Find where they expect to get along up in Heaven.

[02:53:58.290 --> 02:53:58.530]
Right.

[02:53:59.230 --> 02:53:59.670]
Terrific.

[02:53:59.910 --> 02:54:00.310]
Very good.

[02:54:00.470 --> 02:54:02.290]
Excellent to the rationale of the whole problem.

[02:54:02.390 --> 02:54:04.390]
We've solved it almost immediately, folks.

[02:54:04.810 --> 02:54:05.830]
No more racial tension.

[02:54:06.110 --> 02:54:07.590]
No more problems in sound Florida.

[02:54:08.270 --> 02:54:09.670]
Thanks to a very astute caller.

[02:54:10.190 --> 02:54:10.470]
Miami.

Yes, congratulations on them.

[02:54:18.070 --> 02:54:18.830]
Thank you all.

[02:54:18.870 --> 02:54:20.770]
At this point, with these calls, what does it mean?

[02:54:21.350 --> 02:54:25.710]
Well, the last one that's going to go over and listen to Steve, I think, before long,

[02:54:26.130 --> 02:54:27.970]
IOD is going to have to ask for a rebate on there.

[02:54:28.350 --> 02:54:28.510]
Yeah.

[02:54:28.670 --> 02:54:29.610]
No question about it.

[02:54:29.670 --> 02:54:29.830]
There.

[02:54:30.910 --> 02:54:31.830]
I mean, this guy's getting ridiculous.

[02:54:32.010 --> 02:54:35.790]
He's just repeating the same formats he had with all the same old tired garbage and we

[02:54:35.790 --> 02:54:37.130]
don't talk about him.

[02:54:37.250 --> 02:54:37.470]
Really?

[02:54:38.030 --> 02:54:38.290]
Listen.

[02:54:38.290 --> 02:54:44.350]
I want to ask you, did you happen to hear the resolutions that they put before the UN

[02:54:44.350 --> 02:54:46.210]
on the Iran war?

[02:54:47.030 --> 02:54:47.290]
No.

[02:54:47.610 --> 02:54:54.030]
That they want to cease fire and George Schultz has introduced a second resolution if that

[02:54:54.030 --> 02:54:59.610]
one fails, which is to ask all countries to put an embargo on arms to Iran.

[02:54:59.910 --> 02:55:00.370]
Terrific.

[02:55:00.930 --> 02:55:01.790]
That's original idea.

[02:55:02.590 --> 02:55:02.710]
Yeah.

[02:55:03.230 --> 02:55:05.450]
We want to put an embargo on here where we're...

[02:55:05.450 --> 02:55:05.770]
Exactly.

[02:55:05.990 --> 02:55:10.950]
That's because we want to make sure that General Seekord can sell them all himself and Mr.

[02:55:11.110 --> 02:55:11.430]
Hakeem.

[02:55:11.450 --> 02:55:12.850]
We want to make sure they get all the profit.

[02:55:13.390 --> 02:55:15.650]
Just American capitalism, that's all.

[02:55:15.810 --> 02:55:20.490]
I just don't believe the things that they got the goal to come on and ask all the countries

[02:55:20.490 --> 02:55:23.510]
to do these things and then put this all over the...

[02:55:23.510 --> 02:55:24.570]
Were we doing that before?

[02:55:25.170 --> 02:55:29.010]
Were we chastising all the other countries and admonishing them, not to sell any arms

[02:55:29.010 --> 02:55:30.630]
to Iran and we were doing the same thing?

[02:55:30.830 --> 02:55:32.710]
And now we got the goal to come back and ask for it again?

[02:55:32.730 --> 02:55:33.230]
Of course.

[02:55:34.310 --> 02:55:35.850]
That is really incredible.

[02:55:36.550 --> 02:55:38.350]
No, I do want to congratulate you.

[02:55:38.450 --> 02:55:39.450]
Listen to you all the time, Neil.

[02:55:39.590 --> 02:55:40.970]
I've got a lot of people turning on you.

[02:55:41.170 --> 02:55:42.170]
I mean, your show, so.

[02:55:42.410 --> 02:55:42.990]
So to speak.

[02:55:43.290 --> 02:55:43.590]
Okay.

[02:55:43.770 --> 02:55:44.610]
Okay, thanks a lot.

[02:55:44.750 --> 02:55:44.870]
Okay.

[02:55:45.610 --> 02:55:46.850]
143 at W.I.N.Z.

[02:55:46.970 --> 02:55:47.210]
Hello.

[02:55:48.370 --> 02:55:48.770]
Hello.

[02:55:49.710 --> 02:55:50.110]
Goodbye.

[02:55:50.610 --> 02:55:50.990]
Miami.

[02:55:52.010 --> 02:55:52.410]
Hello.

[02:55:52.690 --> 02:55:53.090]
Yes, sir.

[02:55:53.430 --> 02:55:53.830]
Hello, Neil.

[02:55:55.670 --> 02:55:56.610]
How are you doing today?

[02:55:56.890 --> 02:55:57.210]
Okay.

[02:55:57.430 --> 02:55:57.930]
How are you doing?

[02:55:58.110 --> 02:55:58.630]
I am there.

[02:55:58.850 --> 02:55:59.130]
Okay.

[02:55:59.130 --> 02:56:02.890]
First of all, I'd like to say a little of my boss who is in the next room listening to

[02:56:02.890 --> 02:56:06.810]
your show just for the heck of it.

[02:56:06.890 --> 02:56:07.150]
Okay.

[02:56:07.850 --> 02:56:09.930]
Secondly, is that all you want to tell him?

[02:56:10.490 --> 02:56:11.750]
No, he recognized my voice.

[02:56:11.870 --> 02:56:13.610]
Isn't there something else you'd like to say to him?

[02:56:15.270 --> 02:56:17.650]
He could get busy, but you know, that's beside the point.

[02:56:17.850 --> 02:56:21.030]
That you might not want to say to his face, but that might sound good over the ear.

[02:56:21.250 --> 02:56:23.390]
There's nothing I would say to his face.

[02:56:23.570 --> 02:56:24.450]
I would say behind his back.

[02:56:24.510 --> 02:56:27.450]
Okay, in other words, you need the job is what you're saying, right?

[02:56:27.450 --> 02:56:33.230]
Well, yeah, it's nice to, you know, to pay nice, it's good to have money coming in and

[02:56:33.230 --> 02:56:34.050]
all that stuff.

[02:56:34.330 --> 02:56:37.010]
Even if he is a little bit of a schmendrick.

[02:56:39.190 --> 02:56:40.470]
He gets excited.

[02:56:40.930 --> 02:56:41.190]
Okay.

[02:56:41.830 --> 02:56:43.510]
But you know, bosses are like that, right?

[02:56:43.690 --> 02:56:44.090]
Of course.

[02:56:45.090 --> 02:56:46.330]
Not our bosses here.

[02:56:46.390 --> 02:56:47.190]
They're always in a coma.

[02:56:47.310 --> 02:56:47.990]
They never get excited.

[02:56:48.390 --> 02:56:48.770]
No kidding.

[02:56:49.170 --> 02:56:49.290]
Yeah.

[02:56:49.910 --> 02:56:52.890]
Well, maybe mine should be in a coma every now and again.

[02:56:53.110 --> 02:56:53.950]
That way he could relax.

[02:56:54.470 --> 02:56:54.750]
Okay.

[02:56:55.270 --> 02:56:57.390]
I want to wrap on Miami City Commission.

[02:56:57.750 --> 02:56:58.010]
Okay.

[02:56:58.770 --> 02:57:06.410]
Why did these people approve zoning changes in the strip center and tendle when we're

[02:57:06.410 --> 02:57:08.750]
assholes and elbows and cars down there now?

[02:57:10.070 --> 02:57:11.150]
Why do they do things like that?

[02:57:11.950 --> 02:57:14.790]
Do you want to stop and think about what you just said, asshole to elbow?

[02:57:15.010 --> 02:57:16.550]
Have you stopped and really thought about that?

[02:57:16.670 --> 02:57:18.630]
Can you visualize that in your own mind?

[02:57:19.450 --> 02:57:21.530]
I spent five years in the Marine Corps.

[02:57:21.750 --> 02:57:22.310]
What has this got?

[02:57:22.670 --> 02:57:23.110]
Contortionist?

[02:57:23.110 --> 02:57:23.490]
Listen.

[02:57:24.550 --> 02:57:28.470]
If you're from the service, you know what asshole elbow means.

[02:57:28.770 --> 02:57:29.010]
Okay.

[02:57:29.390 --> 02:57:30.010]
You can't move.

[02:57:30.330 --> 02:57:32.350]
Are you calling for this show or for Stan's show?

[02:57:33.490 --> 02:57:36.530]
Because I noticed the last few days now, we started getting these misfits.

[02:57:36.950 --> 02:57:37.970]
I'm not saying you're a misfit.

[02:57:38.130 --> 02:57:39.450]
Oh, well, I'm close, I think.

[02:57:39.570 --> 02:57:40.490]
I think you're borderline.

[02:57:41.010 --> 02:57:44.910]
But we're starting to get a lot of Stan's callers from like about one o'clock, one

[02:57:44.910 --> 02:57:45.230]
fifteen.

[02:57:45.470 --> 02:57:47.530]
They start rolling or trolling in.

[02:57:48.010 --> 02:57:52.730]
And it really has a dramatic change in the thrust of the show.

[02:57:52.910 --> 02:57:53.310]
Is that right?

[02:57:53.610 --> 02:57:53.750]
Yeah.

[02:57:53.970 --> 02:57:56.130]
Maybe I should hang up and call later.

[02:57:56.250 --> 02:57:57.390]
No, no, this is fine.

[02:57:57.510 --> 02:57:59.890]
You can call later on Stan's show and just repeat the whole call.

[02:58:01.030 --> 02:58:06.870]
I was just interested in in your opinion about the Miami City Commission and why they

[02:58:06.870 --> 02:58:07.690]
keep approving.

[02:58:07.870 --> 02:58:08.530]
Forget about them.

[02:58:08.550 --> 02:58:10.770]
Will you please forget about politics in this town?

[02:58:10.850 --> 02:58:12.170]
Forget about them.

[02:58:12.170 --> 02:58:12.870]
Forget about them.

[02:58:13.230 --> 02:58:16.070]
I know, but you see if you forget about them, then they walk on you.

[02:58:16.130 --> 02:58:16.810]
Well, that's okay.

[02:58:16.810 --> 02:58:17.390]
No.

[02:58:17.630 --> 02:58:19.530]
Just lay down on the ground and let them walk on you.

[02:58:19.570 --> 02:58:19.990]
Yeah, right.

[02:58:20.330 --> 02:58:20.810]
And serious?

[02:58:21.230 --> 02:58:21.470]
Yeah.

[02:58:21.950 --> 02:58:23.890]
I mean, I have nothing real life.

[02:58:24.910 --> 02:58:28.510]
You can't let these commission, why do they keep approving stuff like that?

[02:58:29.490 --> 02:58:33.010]
They keep approving script centers and Kendall keeps getting.

[02:58:33.210 --> 02:58:36.570]
First of all, can I say something to you in all honesty, the Miami City Commission has

[02:58:36.570 --> 02:58:37.470]
nothing to do with Kendall.

[02:58:37.650 --> 02:58:39.290]
Kendall is part of unincorporated day.

[02:58:39.310 --> 02:58:40.510]
That's the Metro Commission.

[02:58:40.670 --> 02:58:41.270]
Metro Commission.

[02:58:41.510 --> 02:58:41.610]
Okay.

[02:58:42.230 --> 02:58:45.290]
So if you're going to step on somebody, step on the right people, okay?

[02:58:45.350 --> 02:58:45.750]
I'm the right people.

[02:58:45.750 --> 02:58:48.990]
I mean, the Miami City Commission doesn't speak any English, so leave them alone.

[02:58:49.130 --> 02:58:49.310]
Oh.

[02:58:50.570 --> 02:58:50.970]
Yeah.

[02:58:53.870 --> 02:58:55.190]
Well, I'm here to stay.

[02:58:55.610 --> 02:58:56.610]
So me too.

[02:58:56.950 --> 02:58:59.690]
All the Latin that are here can either learn English or go home.

[02:58:59.990 --> 02:59:00.270]
Okay.

[02:59:00.390 --> 02:59:00.910]
Buenos dias.

[02:59:01.250 --> 02:59:03.710]
How are the oaths?

[02:59:04.450 --> 02:59:07.430]
0.7 to a 4.3.

[02:59:09.510 --> 02:59:11.650]
From 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. 18 to 34.

[02:59:11.890 --> 02:59:14.530]
Of course, that's so we have all these young living and breathing people on.

[02:59:15.090 --> 02:59:17.610]
Which is why we have a lot of funeral parlors on the air, of course.

[02:59:18.350 --> 02:59:24.970]
A lot of nursing homes, there any nursing homes out there that want to advertise will be

[02:59:24.970 --> 02:59:26.070]
delighted to put you on the air.

[02:59:27.250 --> 02:59:28.530]
Because that's our audience.

[02:59:29.530 --> 02:59:32.130]
Of all those a 4.3 and 18 to 34.

[02:59:32.310 --> 02:59:32.850]
How do you like that?

[02:59:34.010 --> 02:59:35.010]
No, they're not teenagers.

[02:59:35.450 --> 02:59:35.530]
Okay.

[02:59:36.050 --> 02:59:39.570]
No, 12 to 17 is teenagers in in arbitron, Lingo.

[02:59:40.070 --> 02:59:40.350]
Okay.

[02:59:40.810 --> 02:59:42.930]
When are you going to come into the real world?

[02:59:42.930 --> 02:59:49.490]
When are you going to break out of this lethargic mindset that you got into it gloves 94 for all those years?

[02:59:49.870 --> 02:59:51.630]
When are you going to come back and be with us?

[02:59:51.770 --> 02:59:53.010]
Those are the members of the living.

[02:59:53.390 --> 02:59:53.730]
When?

[02:59:54.050 --> 02:59:54.970]
When's it going to happen?

[02:59:55.270 --> 02:59:56.050]
Or is it too late?

[02:59:58.550 --> 03:00:00.610]
You sitting here making guttural sound.

[03:00:00.910 --> 03:00:06.510]
Teenagers, like this, you know, unbelievable.

[03:00:08.630 --> 03:00:11.370]
We ask him for certain numbers in a book.

[03:00:11.510 --> 03:00:12.450]
He goes, it's me weekends.

[03:00:12.450 --> 03:00:17.130]
I don't care about the weekend because after this Saturday I'm not working weekends anymore anyway.

[03:00:17.430 --> 03:00:18.950]
Whether they like it or not.

[03:00:20.450 --> 03:00:23.550]
Don't you think it's about time that some of us stood up for our rights?

[03:00:24.350 --> 03:00:26.530]
Slave labor is illegal in the United States.

[03:00:27.690 --> 03:00:29.310]
Does Wally Phillips work on a weekend?

[03:00:29.650 --> 03:00:29.890]
No.

[03:00:31.110 --> 03:00:33.170]
Does Howard Stern work on the weekend?

[03:00:33.530 --> 03:00:33.710]
No.

[03:00:35.170 --> 03:00:37.670]
Does Irene Richard work on the weekend?

[03:00:37.950 --> 03:00:38.190]
No.

[03:00:41.310 --> 03:00:43.530]
The sunny fox work on the weekend.

[03:00:44.050 --> 03:00:44.370]
No.

[03:00:45.350 --> 03:00:47.250]
Does Bill Tanner work on the weekend?

[03:00:47.710 --> 03:00:47.870]
No.

[03:00:48.530 --> 03:00:50.190]
Does Mike Miller work?

[03:00:53.510 --> 03:00:53.930]
No.

[03:00:54.290 --> 03:00:55.250]
Again, same answer.

[03:00:55.430 --> 03:00:55.550]
No.

[03:00:57.190 --> 03:00:58.130]
Call her on a mobile phone.

[03:00:58.150 --> 03:00:59.010]
Yeah, this is a bell.

[03:00:59.370 --> 03:01:00.150]
How are you doing, a bell?

[03:01:00.330 --> 03:01:01.590]
I'm afraid of the bell and I'm not here.

[03:01:01.670 --> 03:01:02.550]
Is this patty a bell?

[03:01:02.890 --> 03:01:03.310]
No.

[03:01:03.630 --> 03:01:04.550]
Just a bell, Florida.

[03:01:04.630 --> 03:01:04.950]
Okay.

[03:01:05.690 --> 03:01:07.310]
How y'all doing in a bell?

[03:01:07.810 --> 03:01:08.170]
Well, I'm not here.

[03:01:08.170 --> 03:01:08.990]
We're surviving.

[03:01:09.310 --> 03:01:10.290]
You doing well in a bell?

[03:01:10.630 --> 03:01:11.370]
Well, in a bell.

[03:01:11.470 --> 03:01:11.910]
Oh, okay.

[03:01:12.330 --> 03:01:13.750]
I'm one of these, uh...

[03:01:13.750 --> 03:01:14.190]
That's well.

[03:01:14.650 --> 03:01:16.110]
Poor folks that couldn't...

[03:01:16.110 --> 03:01:17.770]
Man needs to stay in that county.

[03:01:18.050 --> 03:01:19.910]
I lived there from 45 to 82 and I got to stay in that county.

[03:01:19.910 --> 03:01:20.750]
Well, I don't blame it.

[03:01:20.750 --> 03:01:21.890]
And I had to get out.

[03:01:22.050 --> 03:01:23.270]
You got out just at the right time.

[03:01:23.530 --> 03:01:23.730]
Right.

[03:01:24.170 --> 03:01:26.190]
But I want to make a comment about this dollar thing.

[03:01:26.430 --> 03:01:27.690]
That nobody's even mentioned.

[03:01:27.930 --> 03:01:30.070]
I don't really want to put any blame on anybody.

[03:01:30.310 --> 03:01:30.610]
Okay.

[03:01:31.290 --> 03:01:31.690]
But...

[03:01:31.690 --> 03:01:33.750]
You know the dollar is a non-union airline.

[03:01:34.270 --> 03:01:35.370]
It's never had a union.

[03:01:35.890 --> 03:01:37.530]
And there is an awful lot of people

[03:01:37.530 --> 03:01:41.030]
who have been trying over the years to get them to go union.

[03:01:41.270 --> 03:01:41.410]
Yeah.

[03:01:41.570 --> 03:01:42.990]
You think there's a little sabotage here?

[03:01:43.190 --> 03:01:46.750]
I wouldn't say that, but it's just something to think about.

[03:01:47.090 --> 03:01:49.550]
In other words, you think that they're purposely blowing out the tires?

[03:01:49.750 --> 03:01:51.530]
You think the pilots are kamikazis?

[03:01:51.870 --> 03:01:52.850]
Well, you never know.

[03:01:54.250 --> 03:01:55.130]
I mean, there's nothing.

[03:01:55.550 --> 03:01:57.090]
There hasn't been no real accidents.

[03:01:57.470 --> 03:01:58.350]
There's just been a lot of clothes.

[03:01:58.630 --> 03:01:59.270]
Yeah, that's true.

[03:02:01.010 --> 03:02:02.350]
Well, show me something to think about.

[03:02:02.450 --> 03:02:03.630]
We'll check it out for you.

[03:02:04.710 --> 03:02:06.870]
It's eight minutes before two at W-Y's.

[03:02:06.870 --> 03:02:08.590]
Well, my glad this day is coming to an end.

[03:02:08.650 --> 03:02:10.350]
I knew that, didn't I say it at the beginning of the show?

[03:02:10.550 --> 03:02:11.690]
Did I not say it to you?

[03:02:11.790 --> 03:02:12.870]
It was going to be a real...

[03:02:13.410 --> 03:02:15.870]
I mean, it's almost four hours now.

[03:02:15.910 --> 03:02:16.790]
And I feel like I've been here.

[03:02:17.030 --> 03:02:17.650]
It's like a marathon.

[03:02:17.990 --> 03:02:19.530]
I feel like I've been on the air for 20 hours.

[03:02:19.890 --> 03:02:21.450]
At least, maybe longer.

[03:02:22.110 --> 03:02:23.990]
Okay, we do have one more break to take, right?

[03:02:24.330 --> 03:02:24.850]
I pray.

[03:02:25.110 --> 03:02:25.890]
And we'll come right back.

[03:02:26.430 --> 03:02:26.910]
Let me end.

[03:02:32.070 --> 03:02:33.470]
Okay, we got all of this now.

[03:02:33.530 --> 03:02:35.810]
This should be the Bob Lanciter Memorial Show today,

[03:02:35.810 --> 03:02:36.970]
because it was all very depressing.

[03:02:36.970 --> 03:02:37.970]
And we got it out of the way.

[03:02:38.450 --> 03:02:39.910]
And we also in this last hour,

[03:02:39.910 --> 03:02:41.730]
I've got a lot of Stan's misfits calling in early.

[03:02:41.830 --> 03:02:43.930]
Now, why don't you explain T-R-O-K-N-Y?

[03:02:43.990 --> 03:02:44.430]
Why don't you explain...

[03:02:44.430 --> 03:02:46.270]
How can you be depressed with a nine first?

[03:02:46.270 --> 03:02:48.050]
Why don't you explain to your listeners

[03:02:48.050 --> 03:02:50.270]
that your show starts at two

[03:02:50.850 --> 03:02:53.870]
and that at that time your progress will end until four?

[03:02:54.030 --> 03:02:56.610]
Your callers can begin calling in at two o'clock.

[03:02:56.830 --> 03:02:56.930]
No.

[03:02:56.930 --> 03:02:58.350]
Because lately, last few days,

[03:02:58.350 --> 03:02:59.970]
I've been starting to call in early.

[03:03:00.150 --> 03:03:00.630]
That's great.

[03:03:00.970 --> 03:03:02.290]
And they're incoherent.

[03:03:02.350 --> 03:03:04.610]
Because your callers always call me until six anyway.

[03:03:04.610 --> 03:03:05.770]
They're incoherent.

[03:03:07.410 --> 03:03:09.750]
Well, after yesterday,

[03:03:10.590 --> 03:03:14.150]
and all those right-wing leanings coming back to the surface again,

[03:03:14.230 --> 03:03:15.050]
it's very obvious.

[03:03:15.410 --> 03:03:16.610]
Well, I have to need expensive therapy.

[03:03:17.650 --> 03:03:18.870]
You know, once in a while, I have...

[03:03:18.870 --> 03:03:21.450]
A Jordan Litty syndrome strikes a charge, my batter.

[03:03:21.690 --> 03:03:22.650]
It's not a just like, in fact,

[03:03:22.730 --> 03:03:24.550]
it was even quoting from Pat Buchanan,

[03:03:25.030 --> 03:03:26.590]
one of America's foremost legal figures.

[03:03:26.590 --> 03:03:28.290]
You can tell me you didn't hear yesterday, shoot.

[03:03:28.310 --> 03:03:29.330]
I heard bits and pieces.

[03:03:30.010 --> 03:03:30.650]
And as a matter of fact,

[03:03:30.750 --> 03:03:31.910]
the reason I didn't hear most of it

[03:03:31.910 --> 03:03:33.110]
is because of what I did here.

[03:03:33.110 --> 03:03:34.550]
I'll let the fascist craft...

[03:03:34.550 --> 03:03:35.270]
Oh, I see.

[03:03:35.570 --> 03:03:36.990]
Well, the good part started at four.

[03:03:37.330 --> 03:03:37.750]
Did it really?

[03:03:37.850 --> 03:03:39.810]
When we had the livens, the singles call.

[03:03:40.370 --> 03:03:40.870]
Well, that's...

[03:03:40.870 --> 03:03:41.670]
Kyle agrees with me.

[03:03:41.750 --> 03:03:43.930]
I must have started four because he was gone in,

[03:03:44.010 --> 03:03:45.890]
and I was gone by then from the radio.

[03:03:46.050 --> 03:03:46.790]
Why don't you...

[03:03:46.790 --> 03:03:49.230]
Nothing that we hear old blue-haired lady called in

[03:03:49.230 --> 03:03:50.290]
and wanted to...

[03:03:50.290 --> 03:03:51.910]
Taffy backer, whatever her name is.

[03:03:51.930 --> 03:03:52.050]
Yeah.

[03:03:52.490 --> 03:03:54.210]
You know, and one of the discusses all over the place.

[03:03:54.770 --> 03:03:55.730]
Well, I did hear that call.

[03:03:55.870 --> 03:03:56.750]
I was Taffy's audience.

[03:03:56.970 --> 03:03:58.210]
So, I made her happy.

[03:03:58.350 --> 03:03:59.170]
I programmed my...

[03:03:59.170 --> 03:04:00.530]
I stopped whatever I planned,

[03:04:00.630 --> 03:04:02.110]
and I programmed my old program...

[03:04:02.110 --> 03:04:03.410]
The way the audience...

[03:04:03.410 --> 03:04:03.410]

[03:04:03.590 --> 03:04:04.230]
Blue way, I'm all.

[03:04:04.750 --> 03:04:04.950]
Okay.

[03:04:05.350 --> 03:04:06.510]
Well, when the summer book comes out,

[03:04:06.510 --> 03:04:07.250]
you'll be able to use that.

[03:04:07.290 --> 03:04:08.070]
That'll be a good excuse.

[03:04:08.410 --> 03:04:09.470]
That's what I'm going to say.

[03:04:09.630 --> 03:04:09.910]
Okay.

[03:04:10.110 --> 03:04:11.630]
That allows you topics you lead me.

[03:04:15.850 --> 03:04:17.870]
By the way, I got a great subject about Manson,

[03:04:18.450 --> 03:04:19.690]
which I'll pass along, dear.

[03:04:20.290 --> 03:04:22.410]
But Alibra is going to be in here first, boy.

[03:04:22.410 --> 03:04:23.410]
Well, I don't see him yet.

[03:04:23.630 --> 03:04:24.230]
Is he not in the building?

[03:04:24.290 --> 03:04:24.750]
I don't know.

[03:04:24.950 --> 03:04:26.470]
Well, he probably landed at the wrong airport.

[03:04:28.830 --> 03:04:29.330]
I'm telling you.

[03:04:29.790 --> 03:04:31.990]
Well, he's probably landed at home state Air Force,

[03:04:31.990 --> 03:04:33.750]
maybe he's bucking to work for Delta.

[03:04:34.630 --> 03:04:34.990]
Exactly.

[03:04:35.650 --> 03:04:36.630]
Good idea, Al.

[03:04:36.890 --> 03:04:38.170]
Are you going to be here at 3 o'clock?

[03:04:38.950 --> 03:04:39.590]
I'll be around.

[03:04:39.750 --> 03:04:40.190]
I'd like for you to do that.

[03:04:40.190 --> 03:04:40.630]
I'll be around.

[03:04:40.810 --> 03:04:41.910]
They're going to bring a little food in.

[03:04:41.970 --> 03:04:44.150]
Nothing too fattening, but I've eaten nothing all day.

[03:04:44.350 --> 03:04:44.710]
A zero.

[03:04:45.050 --> 03:04:46.450]
But for all those people who don't...

[03:04:46.450 --> 03:04:47.890]
Don't you think when you get a nine-share,

[03:04:47.970 --> 03:04:49.030]
they ought to bring something in?

[03:04:49.490 --> 03:04:51.350]
Like maybe from the unicorn, something healthful?

[03:04:51.850 --> 03:04:55.290]
At 305, I will tell people what this management should do

[03:04:55.290 --> 03:04:56.230]
with your nine-share.

[03:04:56.390 --> 03:04:58.450]
Okay. Well, I'm going to tell them what to do with it right now.

[03:05:01.990 --> 03:05:04.070]
You've been listening to The Neil Rogers Show.

[03:05:04.450 --> 03:05:08.630]
The views and opinions expressed on this program are those of the host guests and callers.

[03:05:08.890 --> 03:05:09.610]
And I'm not necessarily...
