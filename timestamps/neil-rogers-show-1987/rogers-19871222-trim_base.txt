[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760]
Another one of the problems I'm supposed to do is to this amazing how this fits in.

[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:12.540]
It's right here a commercial free compact disc Christmas from 7pm Christmas Eve to 7pm Christmas Day.

[00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.160]
So what you're going to be doing here Christmas Day is playing just compact disc straight through.

[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.740]
Zeta 4 will be rolling perfect album sides off compact disc without commercial interruptions.

[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.920]
The best classic rock and roll new and old. So now we've done two of these.

[00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.040]
We have six we have to do in four hours which is incredible.

[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.180]
And I did the one where it's no repeat work days every day.

[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.900]
They never played the same record twice from 9 to 5.

[00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.020]
And now I did it's a new feature with my brand new probably starting today.

[00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.320]
And then on Christmas we're going to be rolling compact disc uninterrupted.

[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.160]
That's what you're going to be doing Christmas Day Camp Day.

[00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.840]
Yeah, I believe that Dave has a day off. I think I'm just here.

[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.820]
Oh yeah, yeah, that's right. That's right.

[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.840]
Dave and I and neither one will be here will be just rolling Christmas Day.

[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.640]
Got back this now Christmas. Yeah, it's just my name on the schedule there.

[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.420]
Yeah, that's correct. Now Christmas Eve, which is Thursday.

[00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.780]
Yeah, we're just going to play all bits on the show.

[00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.260]
I love how I'm in on all this. First I'm working and now three minutes later I'm not worried.

[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.320]
Yeah, you would have been working if you were still over there.

[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.880]
That's great. So I don't have to work Christmas Day.

[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.520]
That's correct. So I can sit at home and just watch those parades on TV.

[00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.740]
It's going to be a great year, I tell you.

[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.980]
Now, do you think that Christmas Eve when we're going to run all the bits uninterrupted

[00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.300]
that everyone wants to tape?

[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.120]
Do you think it's even necessary to take phone calls or we can just run the bits Thursday?

[00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.260]
So if you have a thought on this, if I should take calls and request or if we should just run the bits,

[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.000]
you can let me know what you think. And let's go to whoops.

[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.820]
You know, the sound like legal IDs will be a special feature that day too.

[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.060]
Oh, that's right. That's right.

[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.520]
Yeah, that's a great day.

[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.520]
Broward County, huh?

[00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.540]
Yes. Yeah, hi.

[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.960]
I got a few questions for you.

[00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.660]
Number one.

[00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.120]
Okay, first, the question on lead Gillette.

[00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.320]
On his promos, why does he always go lead Gillette?

[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.900]
Why does he put a five second pause between his name?

[00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.220]
Well, you'll have to ask him that, sir. I can't answer your question.

[00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.780]
Oh, really?

[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.060]
I never thought about it.

[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.600]
Oh, okay.

[00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.960]
If I wanted to ask him a question, I would say, why do you say palm beaches?

[00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.860]
Oh, did he pause there too?

[00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.040]
He says it's not palm beaches. It's palm beaches.

[00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.540]
Yeah.

[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:20.100]
Yeah.

[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.560]
It's like the Palmetto Expressway.

[00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:23.940]
Okay, next question.

[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.140]
Why have they been playing?

[00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.980]
Is there something real big about that new story you guys did?

[00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.520]
About the guy that jumped?

[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.560]
About the school teacher?

[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.800]
Yeah, well, he's been playing it all week when he landed on the teenager and everything.

[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.060]
Oh, no, no, no. That is at an oldy. That's that Pink Floyd concert.

[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.280]
Oh, is that what that is?

[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.560]
We think that's one of our classics.

[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.340]
Oh, do you?

[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.520]
Yeah, do you?

[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.700]
Oh, I like it.

[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:54.400]
Yeah, I think it's one of the funniest, it's one of the classic things that has happened in the like 10 weeks we've been on here in the morning.

[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.340]
I mean, the bad thing is, is every time I hear it, I'm driving and I'm always laughing for it.

[00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.640]
I know.

[00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.620]
I'm running to another car.

[00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.000]
It's still funny today to me.

[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.780]
Oh, really?

[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.400]
That's a promo during the rest of the day when we're not on the air and also during the weekend.

[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.080]
We choose little vignettes from the show and with Neil Gahn, we've been choosing a couple of oldies.

[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.260]
Yeah, it's an oldy got a goody.

[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.760]
Yeah, all that is definitely.

[00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:16.940]
I laugh every time I hear it.

[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:17.980]
Did you hear it when it happened?

[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.340]
No, I never did.

[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.660]
Yeah, that was an...

[00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.840]
That's why it's caught me by surprise.

[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.440]
Yeah, that was an incredible morning.

[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.260]
That just happened.

[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.980]
Oh, did it?

[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.300]
Yeah.

[00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.400]
And what I heard it just happened, but...

[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.400]
Yeah, we think it's one of the funniest things Neil ever did.

[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.720]
I was real glad to hear it over the weekend again.

[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.940]
I heard it twice over the weekend.

[00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.540]
Yeah, that I heard it twice over the weekend too.

[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.860]
And I enjoyed it every time.

[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.360]
Yeah.

[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.040]
All right.

[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.020]
I heard another thing.

[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.220]
After that new story, too, there was a new...

[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.800]
A new beaver story.

[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.700]
Oh, a new...

[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.420]
Are you going to eat over Larry's house?

[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.280]
Oh, yeah.

[00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.300]
Is there a way I can get that on?

[00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.680]
Yeah, I got it right here.

[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:50.340]
Oh, do you?

[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.700]
Wait a minute.

[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:51.340]
Let me see.

[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.960]
Let's see.

[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.760]
I got it right here.

[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:55.360]
Oh, do you?

[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.980]
You got it.

[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.380]
All right.

[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.960]
Thanks a lot.

[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.360]
Okay.

[00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.780]
Okay, let's...

[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.800]
This is the beaver we just got at the end of last week.

[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.660]
It's the old new Leibit to beaver,

[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.300]
starring Barbara Billingsley,

[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.040]
Hugh Beaumont,

[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.800]
Tony Dahl,

[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.480]
and Clint Eastwood as the beaver.

[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.120]
Beaver?

[00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.000]
Yeah, mom.

[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.380]
What is it?

[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.240]
There's a package down here.

[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.340]
Fire just came in the mail.

[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.800]
Looks like it's from Bubbles.

[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.740]
Isn't that that girl you know at school?

[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.300]
No, she's a hooker.

[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.180]
She's a hooker.

[00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.800]
We hope she plays hookie from school a lot.

[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.120]
That's where I know her from.

[00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.800]
Later, up in the boys' room.

[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.680]
Hey, Wally.

[00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.460]
Look, I got a package from Bubbles.

[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.500]
Oh, yeah?

[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.860]
What did she send you?

[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.260]
I see her.

[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.460]
Oh, geez.

[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.320]
She sent me her underwear.

[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.640]
I got a quit hanging around those kind of women.

[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.140]
I suppose I could say I told you so,

[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.680]
but I guess this is no time to be rubbing it in.

[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.040]
Well, as long as mom and dad don't find out,

[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.800]
I'll just hide them in the drawer here.

[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.440]
Later, that same episode.

[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.060]
Boy, look what I found in Beaver's drawer.

[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.580]
Where'd that come from?

[00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.540]
Uh-oh, I think I'm in trouble.

[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.780]
Big trouble.

[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.780]
Mom, dad, those underwear belong to, uh,

[00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.520]
to Wally.

[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:32.240]
Wally?

[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.600]
You're talking about...

[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.700]
Yeah, there he is.

[00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.680]
He wears them, presses around in them like, like,

[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.420]
Tinkerbell.

[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.060]
Isn't that right?

[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.980]
Big brother.

[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.440]
Yeah.

[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.940]
Now, that's great.

[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.400]
But that's not what I thought it was.

[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.600]
Now, so because of this, Dave and I pretty much decided

[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.000]
that we're going to organize the room today, right, Dave?

[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.640]
We'll stay and relabel all this stuff.

[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.620]
Because that's a great one, but that's not the one I was thinking about.

[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.820]
Now, what happened to all our other Beavers?

[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.440]
The other one is about...

[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.180]
Why do you think that was the new one?

[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.000]
I don't know. Well, now, I played Billy Idol earlier.

[00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.240]
Yeah, I think I found it, by the way.

[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.860]
Oh, did you?

[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.700]
Okay, is this it?

[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.800]
Day two is neurotic and must speak to you about the chocolate lady.

[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.260]
All right, we'll do this while we're finding all this stuff.

[00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.580]
Hello.

[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:28.600]
Yeah, good morning.

[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:29.260]
Good morning.

[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.320]
Yeah, I'm trying to find out some information, but I'll tell you the idea.

[00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.060]
Is she driving you crazy, sir?

[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.280]
No, I kind of like the way she talks, but I don't know if she can perform it.

[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.980]
I understand you.

[00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.440]
Breath.

[00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:39.540]
Breath feeding.

[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:40.840]
If she can do what?

[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.180]
Well, I think.

[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.680]
Who I like to talk to her about my own, if you can just relate to a thoughtful number

[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:46.920]
of her.

[00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.520]
Now, what about breastfeeding?

[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.560]
Well, that's when I understand she's been breastfeeding.

[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.880]
Yes, she has a young child, Heather.

[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.480]
That's what she's got.

[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.680]
That's what she's been breastfeeding.

[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.120]
Yeah.

[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.240]
Well, I thought she was doing something else.

[00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.220]
What did you think she was doing?

[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.460]
I don't know the way she, I don't know the way to teach up.

[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:05.900]
I'll tell the radio.

[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.400]
Yes, she's incredible, isn't she?

[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.860]
She is.

[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.380]
That's why I like to get a quit with this baby.

[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.000]
Yes, she's 20 years old.

[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.080]
20 years old.

[00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.760]
And she used to be a truck driver.

[00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:14.720]
Oh, she'd know.

[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.720]
Well, she used to be a truck driver.

[00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.640]
Yes, isn't she incredible?

[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.320]
Now, is she driving you crazy, sir?

[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.660]
20 years old and she's about 5'7 and weighs 135 pounds.

[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:30.920]
No, she's 5 feet and weighs 135 pounds.

[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.600]
That's really off-pargant.

[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:34.660]
Is it?

[00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:36.340]
Yes, she's got some weight to lose there.

[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:41.740]
Yes, she kind of, yes, she doesn't go correctly into our computer.

[00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.300]
She doesn't come out correctly.

[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:44.640]

[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.600]
Well, I'd like to get a quit with this baby if I could.

[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:47.340]
I got a little off.

[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.200]
I got a little question for her, right?

[00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.700]
Maybe she can help me out with something.

[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.840]
Yes, can you say it on the radio?

[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.080]
Well, I don't think it's the proper thing to say on the radio.

[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.240]
Why, but I think I got a loud stuff like that.

[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.360]
And on the radio.

[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:03.680]
You don't think I could allow it?

[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.840]
Oh, no, I don't think so.

[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.040]
That what you want to eat her?

[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.720]
I mean, what you want to ask her?

[00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.680]
I can't believe I said that.

[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:10.960]
No, I don't know.

[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.220]
I don't know if it's a problem.

[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.900]
Just a slip there, sir.

[00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:15.940]
I didn't mean to say that.

[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:16.740]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:17.820]
I'm serious.

[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:18.460]
I'm serious.

[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.200]
I like to meet this lady.

[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.180]
Yeah, when we talk about her, see what happens?

[00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.220]
Can I cap and Dave?

[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.320]
See what happens when we talk about this lady?

[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.920]
I've never slipped that down.

[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.340]
I'm serious.

[00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:32.840]
I like to show her something.

[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:34.560]
You would.

[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:35.440]
Yeah, definitely.

[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:36.440]
Definitely.

[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:37.440]
Okay.

[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.420]
Well, I'll ask her an ex-sum I talked to her.

[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:41.400]
See if she's interested.

[00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:42.880]
She's so color-funny.

[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:44.300]
It's only trying to get a hold of her.

[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:44.700]
Okay.

[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.480]
Let's see how much she's got.

[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:47.300]
Uh-huh.

[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.700]
All right.

[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.200]
Hey, by the way, ask her if she's too well breastfeeding her.

[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.400]
Yeah, I think she is.

[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:53.200]
So, there she is.

[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:53.520]
Yeah.

[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.520]
Is that appeal to you?

[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:55.320]
Yeah, definitely.

[00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:55.880]
Okay.

[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:56.720]
All right now.

[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.280]
All right.

[00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:58.140]
Go on, though.

[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.600]
You said it so distinctly.

[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.760]
You didn't stop or anything.

[00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.640]
Well, you can't stop when you do something like that.

[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:13.600]
Freudian.

[00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.040]
Yeah, boy was it ever.

[00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:16.000]
Date County, hi.

[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:16.720]
Hello, Glenn.

[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.220]
Hi.

[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:18.620]
I'm all right.

[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.740]
Listen, I'm going to use an input.

[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:21.180]
Are you okay?

[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:21.180]

[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:21.180]

[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:21.180]

[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:21.180]

[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:21.180]

[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:24.820]
Yeah.

[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.100]
I'm fine.

[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:44.480]
I'm fine.

[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:44.480]

[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:44.480]

[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:44.480]

[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:44.480]

[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:44.480]

[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:44.480]

[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:44.480]

[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:44.480]

[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:44.480]

[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:44.480]

[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:44.480]

[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:44.480]

[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:44.480]

[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:44.480]

[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:44.560]
I'm fine.

[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:44.600]
I'm fine.

[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:44.600]

[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:44.600]

[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:44.860]
I'm fine.

[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:44.860]

[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:45.140]
I'm fine.

[00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:45.940]
I'm fine.

[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:46.420]
I'm fine.

[00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:47.820]
I'm fine.

[00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.180]
I'm fine.

[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.160]
I'm fine.

[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:51.440]
I'm fine.

[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.580]
So, didn't perhaps after we run everything, didn't take requests for some repeats.

[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.820]
Maybe something like that.

[00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:00.480]
Yeah, just as long as you get all the bits on first and then, you know, you can, after that,

[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.240]
then you can get them calling.

[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.300]
I would probably be with the best idea.

[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.420]
So, you think we should run all the bits and then if we have time we can play?

[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:07.760]
Yes.

[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:08.800]
I think that would be the best.

[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.220]
So, the number one priority is to be sure that all the bits are.

[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:12.620]
Yeah.

[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.160]
Because I'll be here taking them to know.

[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:14.420]
All right.

[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.080]
I got them all.

[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.560]
Okay, I'll remember what you said.

[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:17.120]
Okay.

[00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:18.080]
And I'll cap and day.

[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.980]
Yeah, he walked out for a second. I think he can hear you though. Okay, listen

[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:25.960]
I hate to sound like a broken record Glenn, but you think you can ask him to do that EDR

[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:31.580]
Station identification. Oh, I'll ask him sure. Okay, because I'd like to get it down on

[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:38.260]
Okay, all right. Thanks a lot. All right, 709 now we found the leave of taboeuvre finally as we are slowly

No, I don't listen anymore. He's a daughtering old man. He claims he's only 40. Yeah, right and do we be true in two?

[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:40.980]
Oh

[00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:42.400]
Shut up a girl

[00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:48.020]
And if you think he's bad now wait until he had you oh

[00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:57.120]
Okay, when we come back maybe the egg will come out of his shell, but I hope not

[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:04.660]
Quarter after seven seven fifteen Zeta four Neil Rogers show cap Dave do you think?

[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:09.900]
We've we've had precious few women who want to get in on our

[00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:15.060]
I think it's first of all it's Monday. Yeah second of all it's the Monday before Christmas

[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:22.300]
Mm-hmm, and I think the majority of people are either sleeping or been partying or out of town or in combination of the above

[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:30.480]
So we may as well just in other words what entertain each other? Yeah, we'll just sit here and do whatever the hell we want to do

[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:35.040]
Here's my story it's strange but true

[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.540]
I'm out of the show that I want to

[00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:47.040]
He took his push and ran around

[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.960]
Do every single people in town

[00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:56.180]
Yes

[00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:28.060]
but because

[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:32.200]
Do your parties for something

[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.500]
Just but so it may sound

[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:36.160]
And

[00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:39.040]
Oh

[00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:59.160]
I wonder how we get to round, yeah, it's a thing they never cut, to round

[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:06.200]
Now people do what I say, but give him to talk every day

[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.420]
It's the more I love the stories of my guys

[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:12.440]
It's the land I'm trying to give him something before he's so alive

[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.500]
He might be a little more fun of people, so I'm alive

[00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.420]
Or maybe that's my show up is a spline bomb

[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:23.320]
It's the best song to me, it's the best song to me

[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:28.420]
It's the best song to me, it's the best song to me, it's the best song to me

[00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:35.320]
I wonder how we get to round, yeah, it's a thing they never cut, to round

[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:42.300]
Now people do what I say, but give him to talk every day

[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:44.540]
It's the more I love the stories of my guys

[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:48.540]
It's the last time I give him something before he's so alive

[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.640]
He might be a little more fun of people, so I'll survive

[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.160]
Or maybe that's my show up is a spline bomb

[00:19:55.460 --> 00:20:01.260]
It's the best song to me, no matter what you do

[00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:03.900]
It's the拳空谷

[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:09.900]
It's the most fun, everybody is so clean

[00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.940]
Get, get, get, I appreciate my stuff I got back in.

[00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:15.960]
You know that's the right, get something to do.

[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.960]
Get, get, get something to the right, get some all.

[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:24.800]
And everybody's the right, get, get to the right, get to the right.

[00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:25.940]
Okay.

[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:31.540]
We've already started organizing the room as I look for stuff.

[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.680]
We cannot find anything.

[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:37.480]
I'm looking for something, but I get back into it in a minute.

[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.840]
Can you do the weather here, Captain Dave?

[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.320]
And then I'm going to do a spot for TJ Sentiments.

[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.080]
Zeta forecast, partly cloudy and mild today with a high of 80.

[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:51.600]
Loatownite 69, it'll be increasingly cloudy tomorrow with a high of 82.

[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.680]
Increasing chance of rain too.

[00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:55.960]
But the outlook for Christmas, partly cloudy and mild.

[00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:57.900]
And right now it's 73 in South Florida.

[00:20:58.220 --> 00:20:58.520]
Okay.

[00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.340]
Oh, here it is.

[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:00.500]
All right.

[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:02.360]
So we'll play this next.

[00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:07.640]
And, but first I have to tell you about a holiday gift suggestion from TJ Sentiments.

[00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:11.260]
And you know we get those in here all the time in the morning.

[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.500]
And boy, are they great?

[00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:16.460]
And right now when you stop into any of the four TJ Sentiments locations in South

[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:22.160]
Florida, you can pick up a special holiday 10 filled with either four of those scrumptious

[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:26.780]
original sentiment rolls or five delicious pecan sticky buns.

[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.200]
And a holiday 10 is a perfect gift for anyone.

[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.760]
And you can send these incredible edibles anywhere in the continental U.S.

[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.460]
Just stop by TJ Sentiments today.

[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:39.120]
Find out more details on how you can send a special holiday 10 to someone you love.

[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:43.840]
And while you're there, pick up a few TJ Sentiments gifts or delegates to put into the stockings

[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:45.620]
or pass out at the office.

[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:50.320]
And speaking about the office, nothing wakes up a business meeting better than a cup of coffee.

[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.240]
And TJ Sentiments original sentiment rolls,

[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:58.020]
cinnamon loaf, pecan sticky buns and cinnamon raisin bread.

[00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:02.000]
So when we had them last week, they do make the coffee taste better in the morning.

[00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.580]
I swear they really do.

[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:04.340]
Okay?

[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.760]
They're in Pomphano Square TJ Sentiments.

[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:11.600]
Also in the Galleria in Fort Lauderdale, the Kindle Mall, 107th and Kindle Drive,

[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:17.220]
and the new location, which is 2055 University Drive in the Carl Pom Plaza.

[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:21.840]
And that's in Carl Springs when we're talking about one of our favorites around here, folks.

[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.060]
We can't seem to get enough of them.

[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.980]
TJ Sentiments.

[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:26.880]
All right.

[00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:31.760]
Coming up on 721 at Zeta4, on the Neal Rogers Show and Dade County next.

[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:32.140]
Hi.

[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:34.660]
Where in Captain it's in Ricky from sunny-out.

[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.240]
Ricky, how you doing today?

[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:37.900]
I just woke up.

[00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:39.040]
You just woke up?

[00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:41.180]
I had to call the course.

[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:41.880]
Uh-huh.

[00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:42.960]
It's like a sickness.

[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:44.220]
Yeah, it's a disease.

[00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:45.920]
And you know there's no cure for it.

[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.540]
Are you aware of that?

[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:51.800]
Well, it's a good thing because it feels good.

[00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:52.300]
Uh-huh.

[00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:53.640]
All right.

[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.740]
You know, I've been meaning to ask this for months and months.

[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:05.720]
During the so far campaign, I was hoping to get the three-way and to get on it.

[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:06.560]
I never got that.

[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:08.180]
No, that's gone forever, sir.

[00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.820]
I mean, it's gone forever even on a private tape.

[00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:11.520]
That's correct.

[00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:12.800]
And that's really weird.

[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:15.160]
That was the freeway in Spic.

[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:19.620]
It was the only thing in the history of Neal and AM and here on the FM that we took

[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:21.120]
unauthorized.

[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:25.820]
We took that from a, that's from what's his name in New York.

[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:26.520]
What's his name?

[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:28.540]
How not Howard Stern?

[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:29.480]
Don Imez.

[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:29.920]
Yeah.

[00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:31.520]
That was a Don Imez bit.

[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:34.340]
And we were unauthorized to play that.

[00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:35.320]
But it was so funny.

[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:36.160]
We played it.

[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.920]
But that's why it got pulled because we really weren't supposed to.

[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:42.340]
That's the only thing we've ever done like that that we weren't supposed to do.

[00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:43.240]
That's what happened.

[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:46.560]
I was never sure why because I never got to listen to Neal all the time.

[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.240]
Was always doing breaks or something.

[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.340]
And I never got the full reason out.

[00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:51.380]
No, that was the reason.

[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.420]
That we did something wrong, sir.

[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.520]
We just couldn't resist.

[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:57.600]
It was so funny.

[00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:58.280]
Don't you agree?

[00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:00.160]
It was a, it was a bad.

[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:00.820]
I know.

[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:02.200]
It really was the best.

[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:04.400]
I mean, I always wanted to show it off.

[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.420]
You know, and tape it.

[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:07.780]
But I never got a chance to tape it.

[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:09.620]
Well, I'm sorry it's gone.

[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:10.500]
That hurts.

[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.700]
Anyway, how about the James Brown alarm?

[00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:15.840]
I just played it while you were asleep.

[00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:16.980]
I'm sorry.

[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:19.040]
I played it like 15 minutes ago.

[00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:20.120]
You were unconscious.

[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:21.220]
I certainly was.

[00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:22.340]
I'm sorry.

[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:23.820]
I'll do it for you tomorrow though.

[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:24.680]
All right.

[00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:25.220]
Okay.

[00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:25.860]
Thank you for that.

[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:27.100]
And, uh, bye-bye.

[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:27.500]
Bye.

[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.240]
And that was a pretty good bye-bye.

[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:30.320]
Dave County, hi.

[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:31.220]
Good morning.

[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:31.860]
Good morning.

[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.340]
Happy, uh, happy Christmas.

[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:34.380]
Yeah, same to you.

[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.080]
Happy holidays.

[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.380]
Christmas week and all that.

[00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:39.840]
Yeah, I just wanted to call and wish you guys, uh, wish you guys the best of the

[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:44.800]
holidays and, uh, I think you're doing a great job, even though Neil's not around.

[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:49.320]
Well, we're just trying to sort of relax this week, you know, because everybody's off

[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.800]
and off school and everything.

[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:54.140]
And, uh, so we're just sort of hanging out playing around, you know.

[00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:55.900]
Yeah, but it's good fun, you know.

[00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:56.480]
Yeah, good.

[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:57.880]
Well, I'm having a good time.

[00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.360]
I am too listening.

[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:00.600]
I enjoy you guys.

[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.740]
I've been listening ever since you came over to the FM.

[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:03.320]
Mm-hmm.

[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:07.400]
And, uh, it's sort of a whole new way of looking at the morning.

[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.020]
So in other words, you never listened to Neil when he was on AM.

[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:11.100]
I never lived down here.

[00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:11.900]
Oh, is that right?

[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:12.840]
Where'd you come from?

[00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:13.540]
North Carolina.

[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:14.380]
Oh, boy.

[00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:17.180]
Is this really like your first Christmas in Florida?

[00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:21.880]
Um, I've been Christmas always up in North Florida, but this is like the first time down

[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:22.260]
in Miami.

[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.220]
Yeah, you're going to like it.

[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.640]
80 degrees on Christmas day.

[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:25.420]
Can you believe it?

[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:28.820]
It's a lot to be said for sitting on the beach on Christmas day.

[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:29.420]
I agree.

[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.240]
Yeah, that's the way I like it.

[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.400]
It's the best.

[00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:38.960]
And also, uh, you know, you can see what's under those, uh, what would normally be under

[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:39.740]
those heavy coats.

[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:40.740]
Yeah, right.

[00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:42.680]
That's, that's really true.

[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:45.700]
Of course, you don't have any problem with that with all these women that call up.

[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.200]
Can you believe all these women?

[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:48.740]
Yeah, that's pretty amazing.

[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:50.640]
I wanted to know what your secret was.

[00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:54.880]
Yeah, I, you know, I've been wondering myself what I have done to deserve all this, but

[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.380]
I am enjoying it.

[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:01.020]
Yeah, I guess this, you know, once you, uh, once you get on the air with Neil,

[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:02.780]
you know, and yeah, I guess you're right.

[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:04.600]
So I'm just going to try to enjoy it.

[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.760]
Yeah, did you hear the chocolate syrup lady earlier?

[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:07.740]
No, not today.

[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:08.560]
You missed that call.

[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.680]
Oh, boy, we should have taped that one.

[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:11.720]
All right.

[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:16.400]
Well, yeah, one to ask you to if you play the, uh, either the Neil Rogers disease or the

[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.140]
Gwynne Hill disease.

[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:17.980]
You got it.

[00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:18.640]
Thanks a lot.

[00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:19.020]
Okay.

[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:19.740]
Very Christmas.

[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:20.240]
Okay.

[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:21.060]
Captain Dave.

[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:21.580]
Okay.

[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:21.860]
Bye.

[00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:22.540]
Okay.

[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:22.640]

[00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:27.100]
Let me play this request first, and then we will, uh, we'll get the diseases on for me on

[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:27.180]
the day.

[00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:29.280]
I'm going to have a great weekend, say to 724 now.

[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:38.860]
He went away and you went around.

[00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:40.440]
And bothered me every night.

[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.660]
My window I would do.

[00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:46.100]
He said some things that just were very nice.

[00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:57.200]
My boyfriend, back and you're going to be in trouble.

[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:00.540]
Hey, love, hey, love, my boyfriend, back.

[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:03.860]
When you pay him, comment better, head out on the job block.

[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:07.140]
Hey, love, hey, love, my boyfriend, love.

[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:09.540]
You've been spreading the pulp that I was untrue.

[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.660]
Hey, love, hey, love, my boyfriend, love.

[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:26.660]
He doesn't even try and, but soon we'll be can't watch.

[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:30.040]
He's the God in such a long time.

[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:40.440]
Hey, love, hey, love, my boyfriend, love.

[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:42.420]
If you're going to be sorry, you are ever born.

[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:48.600]
He doesn't even try and get you back.

[00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:49.940]
He's just a bit strong.

[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:56.340]
He knows I wasn't cheating.

[00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:58.000]
That's right.

[00:27:58.140 --> 00:27:59.540]
So you're going to take a beating.

[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:02.840]
You're a bit boy now, but he'll catch you down the side.

[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.860]
I hate you.

[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.900]
I hate you and I'll just pick up a lot.

[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:15.800]
I hate you.

[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:22.680]
My God, the guy keeps going to save my reputation.

[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:29.620]
So why don't you live like yesterday on your permanent vacation?

[00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:35.780]
I can see him coming.

[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:38.800]
He really better get into your deed and start running.

[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:42.200]
You're a bit boy now, but he'll catch you down the side.

[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:48.820]
Because like me, he just tests your guts and all your hateful eyes.

[00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:53.840]
My boyfriend's back.

[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.560]
There's going to be such a lot of trouble.

[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.980]
Hey, love, hey, love, my boyfriend.

[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:02.680]
My boyfriend's back.

[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:05.980]
My boyfriend's back.

[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.240]
I hate you.

[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:16.520]
I hate you because I hate you.

[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:20.260]
God will come for you.

[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.360]
Hi, hi.

[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:22.640]
We're coming quickly.

[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:23.260]
I'm thrilled.

[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.840]
You believe us, huh?

[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.000]
I don't feel like a human being.

[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:33.640]
727 is 8 to 4.

[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:35.900]
That's the BJs with my boyfriend's back.

[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:37.620]
But we're pressed now.

[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.020]
Rich is here with the computer.

[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:41.200]
Are you disappointed that people aren't asking?

[00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:42.080]
I'm surprised.

[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:43.760]
We only had a few women call in.

[00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:46.380]
And maybe some guys who are cross-dresses may want to call in.

[00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:51.780]
Okay, let's just go down the line and see what's on people's minds.

[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:56.420]
And then we'll play one of the diseases for you that we have to request for.

[00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:57.720]
Good morning, Broward County.

[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:58.520]
Hello, buddy.

[00:29:58.760 --> 00:29:59.420]
How you doing, pal?

[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:00.140]
Pretty good.

[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:01.240]
What's up?

[00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:05.200]
Everything's fine.

[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:10.560]
How are you today?

[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:11.980]
Not bad, sir.

[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:13.940]
I want to thank you for the tape, sir.

[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.560]
Oh, you got your tape.

[00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:17.980]
And how was it?

[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:21.760]
Oh, it's fine, sir.

[00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:51.660]
I'm going to give it a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit

[00:32:56.260 --> 00:33:21.300]
of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of

[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:25.640]
Like Rostadjou and Fairfax Avenue stuff like that.

[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:28.420]
I've got a number of known past tapes.

[00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:28.860]
Uh-huh.

[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:32.820]
Well, I'll get everyone that he has carted up in here.

[00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:34.220]
I will play it for you right in a row.

[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:35.500]
All right, thank you, my friend.

[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:35.860]
OK.

[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:36.940]
See you later.

[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:40.040]
Right now, here's the Neal Rogers disease that we had a request for.

[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:40.860]
It's 732.

[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:43.560]
This is Zeta 4 in the Rogers Show.

[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:50.440]
Alan Box was a normal man with a wife, children,

[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:53.880]
a summer home in Opalaka, and a chain of radio stations.

[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:57.080]
Well, normal that is until just three weeks ago.

[00:34:57.820 --> 00:34:58.580]
Hi, honey.

[00:34:58.740 --> 00:34:59.280]
How was your day?

[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:01.320]
Unbelievable.

[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:02.800]
Terminal.

[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:06.060]
There's nothing but subhuman douchebags out there.

[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:09.740]
Alan Box is suffering from Neal Rogers disease.

[00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:12.020]
Have you canceled the Miami Herald yet?

[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:14.300]
But honey, we don't subscribe to the Herald.

[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:14.840]
Oh, no.

[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.020]
That's a cop out.

[00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:17.660]
What kind of a lame excuse is that?

[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:19.760]
Just say no to L. Herald, sir.

[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:20.120]
Huh?

[00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:25.400]
People afflicted with Neal Rogers disease have lost the ability to communicate like normal

[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:26.300]
human beings.

[00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:27.720]
What's the matter with you?

[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:30.060]
Blue-haired old bags from Fembroke Pines.

[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:35.200]
You know, the Yenthas, who say, all Neal, how can you say those nasty things?

[00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:37.100]
Running around stealing sweet and low.

[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.240]
Can I get you anything?

[00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:40.460]
How about those bad boys at Windixi?

[00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:41.700]
You know, it doesn't hurt to look.

[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:43.440]
In credible.

[00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:48.780]
Neal Rogers disease, a growing South Florida epidemic, please help us find a cure.

[00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:50.520]
Honey, it's Friday night.

[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:52.160]
You know what that means.

[00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:53.000]
Hey, you know what I got?

[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:53.480]
A nine.

[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:54.240]
A nine.

[00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:55.660]
What's Lephalor got?

[00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:56.420]
Three points, something?

[00:35:57.020 --> 00:36:00.280]
Send your tax deductible contributions today in Carro hot 105.

[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:01.880]
Terminal.

[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:03.800]
Be believable.

[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:05.960]
All right.

[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:07.360]
It's 734.

[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:08.280]
Exactly.

[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:09.360]
Hey, Glenn.

[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:09.880]
Yes, sir.

[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.880]
We got the original formula guy here.

[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:13.400]
The guy that gave us the formula the other morning.

[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:13.740]
Yeah?

[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:14.760]
We're about to.

[00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:15.640]
He's on Broward, too.

[00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:17.580]
This is the man who gave us the formula.

[00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:18.000]
Hello.

[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:18.180]
Hello?

[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:22.320]
No, this is not the man who gave us the formula.

[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:23.080]
She wants to borrow it.

[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:23.620]
You got Broward.

[00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:24.160]
This is Broward.

[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:24.340]
Sorry.

[00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:25.160]
Hi, what's up?

[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:25.820]
Wait a minute.

[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:26.380]
Wait a minute.

[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.360]
I, you said let's hold on a minute with Captain Dave.

[00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:31.040]
I didn't know you were putting me back on.

[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:31.860]
Uh-oh.

[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:32.540]
What?

[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:33.440]
What did you want?

[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:34.240]
Oh, well.

[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:35.960]
Is this the chocolate syrup lady?

[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:36.380]
Yes.

[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:40.340]
I was staying unsafe from sleeping around on the dials just a minute ago.

[00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:40.820]
Uh-huh.

[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:44.560]
And it just happened that there was, this isn't alive.

[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:45.800]
This is real truth.

[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:47.700]
And I was wondering, Captain Dave heard it.

[00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:50.320]
That there was a chocolate syrup truck that had a wreck.

[00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:52.800]
There's a chocolate syrup truck that had a wreck.

[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:53.820]
Yes, it's true.

[00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:55.120]
I think it's mine.

[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:56.020]
Are you all upset?

[00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:58.760]
Yeah, because it wasn't here in Florida.

[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:00.320]
It wasn't in Florida?

[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:01.120]
No.

[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.260]
Well then why are you upset?

[00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:06.880]
That's like free chocolate.

[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:09.180]
I think I might have gotten rid of it.

[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:11.380]
Uh, we don't have the story anymore.

[00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:15.420]
Uh, so you've thrown our formula off.

[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:15.980]
Did you hear that?

[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:17.600]
Yes, I know.

[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:22.500]
We've been doing other women and they've all come out like right on the letter, right on the number.

[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.320]
My whole life has always been told that was different.

[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:27.040]
Yeah, you don't work.

[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:28.960]
You don't work right?

[00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:31.040]
Oh yes, I do.

[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.640]
Here it is, here it is.

[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:35.700]
I'm sorry, what one second?

[00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:37.680]
Did you hear the guy call up who wanted to meet you?

[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:38.600]
Um.

[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:41.480]
You missed that call because you were, huh?

[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:42.060]
Honey.

[00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:43.860]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:45.380]
Do you want to meet him?

[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:46.280]
You have his number.

[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:49.720]
Uh, you really want to meet him?

[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:51.620]
Not in person, I talk for...

[00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:52.520]
Okay, alright.

[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:54.580]
Get the melting pot, buy me all the chocolate.

[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:55.940]
What's up?

[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:57.780]
Okay, you got the story?

[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:05.680]
It was in Kansas City, a truck carrying 4,000 gallons of warm liquid chocolate overturned

[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:12.460]
yesterday forcing cleanup workers to use a snow plow and sending children scurrying for sacks.

[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:13.960]
What?

[00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:17.880]
It looked like a chocolate ice rink, a fire department spokesman said.

[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.460]
So you jealous, you wish you were there, right?

[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:22.360]
Warm liquid chocolate.

[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:23.460]
You wish you were there?

[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:24.640]
Chocolate syrup?

[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:25.300]
Yeah.

[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:26.820]
Yeah, well, you'll be okay.

[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.380]
That's so disgusting.

[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:30.540]
You want to hold on?

[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:31.420]
Sure.

[00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:33.740]
We want to talk to the man with the formula here.

[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:34.040]
Hi.

[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:35.660]
How are you doing?

[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:36.420]
A real fine.

[00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:36.940]
A while.

[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:43.240]
So your formula is working basically, but there seems to be some exceptions to the rule as what we found out.

[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:51.240]
Yeah, I, uh, as I mentioned to you the other day, I really discovered this back when I was about the eighth grade.

[00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:51.820]
Really?

[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:53.840]
And it worked out real well.

[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:59.860]
It was a great way to, uh, introduce, uh, yourself to a young lady that you were interested in.

[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:00.480]
Mm-hmm.

[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:03.100]
And it worked very, very well on young women.

[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:04.200]
Is that right?

[00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:10.860]
Uh, uh, yes, or Friday when I called this in, I went back to sleep and recorded the rest of the show.

[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:11.340]
Uh-huh.

[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:12.340]
That's why I didn't call that.

[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:12.700]
Right.

[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:16.100]
But, uh, I got a little nervous about the old formula.

[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:20.560]
So all weekend long, of course, I was, uh, punching my calculator buttons.

[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:21.100]
Uh-huh.

[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:23.160]
Almost getting punched out at the same time.

[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:23.480]
Right.

[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:32.160]
And, uh, found out that it seemed like the older, uh, the ladies yet, the more off it seems to be.

[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:40.160]
And, you know, if you're going to make a mistake, if you think you're wrong, you have to add about an interest to an interest in a half.

[00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:41.040]
And then you've got it.

[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:41.860]
I see.

[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:42.920]
I see.

[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:43.420]
Yeah.

[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:45.620]
Well, that would be, that would make sense, yeah.

[00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:52.780]
Unless you've got somebody that just, uh, you know, just totally takes this thing off the wall like the chocolate syrup.

[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:54.780]
Yeah, exactly like the chocolate syrup lady.

[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:56.400]
Although we're, we're kind of close.

[00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:58.160]
Well, maybe two inches off on her.

[00:39:58.820 --> 00:39:59.500]
That's not that bad.

[00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:02.240]
Now, tell us where this formula came from again.

[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:11.640]
You told us Friday, but, uh, well, it, it came from a friend of mine who raised Cal.

[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:13.240]
Yeah.

[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:13.800]
Yeah.

[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:14.820]
That's what you said.

[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:16.280]
It came from Cal's who.

[00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:20.820]
There was a way of, uh, figuring out the girth of a cow, I guess.

[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:21.140]
Yeah.

[00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:24.680]
And it's, it's the numbers verbatim, I guess.

[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:26.340]
It were done halfers real.

[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:27.360]
Yeah.

[00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:27.980]
Yeah.

[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:28.160]

[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:33.540]
And so, yeah, for the most part, it does work, but we do get those exceptions that are just not, you know.

[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:37.360]
There were the other ways that you've mentioned finding out the same information.

[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:38.160]
I think I prefer.

[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:38.760]
Oh.

[00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:39.700]
Yeah.

[00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:40.860]
They'll just let them tell me.

[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:44.000]
But as you can see, it, it's a lot of fun.

[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:44.240]
Yeah.

[00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:47.480]
And we've been thrilled to introduce this formula to South Florida.

[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:53.020]
It did seem to catch a lot of, you know, we had a lot of calls about it.

[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:57.960]
And we've been testing out, but so you think it works best, say, like on teenagers.

[00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:01.660]
Now, not teenagers through about 30 years.

[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:01.880]
Yeah.

[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:02.400]
Yeah.

[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:03.740]
That seems to be what we're finding.

[00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:05.720]
And then it gets a little off.

[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:08.200]
And if it's an older woman, I've been adding about two inches.

[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:10.480]
And that, that gets me pretty close.

[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:11.000]
Mm-hmm.

[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:15.860]
But you know, the other time I ever shared this, I used to teach math here.

[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:22.180]
You know, if the classes were getting a little small, this would perk up the interest.

[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:22.660]
Yeah.

[00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:23.500]
I bet.

[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:24.040]

[00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:25.480]
The license is too, by the way.

[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:26.160]
Yeah.

[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:28.500]
Well, this seems to be a lot of people interested in this.

[00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:34.480]
Now, as I say again, this is not going to be the only thing we do while Neil's gone, or we'll never hear the end of it.

[00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:36.240]
I know I can hardly wait to hear that.

[00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:36.560]
Yeah.

[00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:37.280]
Oh boy.

[00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:44.060]
You know, the fact that we're talking about bra sizes and breasts on the Neil Roger show is pretty incredible, if you think about it.

[00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:45.320]
It certainly is.

[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:45.800]
Yeah.

[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.280]
But we've had a lot of fun with it.

[00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:49.560]
But this is probably the last day we're going to mess with it.

[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:55.800]
I have to admit, I mean, the show is as much fun as listening to Neil and you guys are doing a great job.

[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:56.920]
Well, that's a great compliment.

[00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:58.460]
Thanks a lot for helping us out.

[00:41:58.500 --> 00:41:58.760]
Okay.

[00:41:59.060 --> 00:41:59.560]
See you later.

[00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:00.380]
All right.

[00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:01.620]
Dade County, hi.

[00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:02.480]
How you doing?

[00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:03.040]
All right.

[00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:03.760]
Hey, Bert.

[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:04.740]
How you doing?

[00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:06.200]
First time in college, right?

[00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:07.220]
Hey, is that right?

[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:07.680]
Yeah.

[00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:09.440]
You're afraid to talk to Uncle Neil?

[00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:10.200]
Huh?

[00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:11.260]
Oh, no, no.

[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:13.760]
I guess I was hurting about that computer there.

[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:14.400]
Oh, yeah.

[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:15.640]
What do you think about it?

[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:16.220]
I'll see what happens.

[00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:17.520]
What do you think about it?

[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:20.580]
It looks good so far when I try to convince you what happened.

[00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:21.380]
You do?

[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:21.960]
Yeah.

[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:22.920]
Okay, let's go.

[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:24.060]
How much do you weigh?

[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:26.340]
About 190, 192.

[00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:28.120]
Let's put 192 in.

[00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:29.580]
And how tall are you?

[00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:30.040]
Five nine.

[00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:30.900]
Five nine.

[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:32.300]
This is real funny on men.

[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:34.600]
Oh, okay.

[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:36.260]
The computer says 42.

[00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:37.600]
What?

[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:38.480]
42.

[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:39.360]
Oh, wait, man.

[00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:40.500]
Well.

[00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:42.200]
Maybe that's the size of your stomach.

[00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:45.680]
Oh, I got a 33, almost a 32 weight.

[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:47.460]
It doesn't work on guys.

[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:48.960]
And Neil.

[00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:49.640]
Taller.

[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:50.960]
He's five nine.

[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.000]
And 190 something?

[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:54.640]
And you have a 32 waist?

[00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:55.780]
Well, God bless you, man.

[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:57.240]
You have to work out a lot of something.

[00:42:57.980 --> 00:42:58.260]
Hey, man.

[00:42:58.340 --> 00:42:59.700]
You got to go into the gym and work out.

[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:01.340]
I guess you're right.

[00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:02.880]
Yeah, it doesn't seem to work on guys.

[00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:05.900]
And Neil would love it if we had a formula for guys, but we don't.

[00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:06.900]
All right.

[00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:10.060]
So you enjoy it as we try it on women today, some.

[00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:10.680]
All right.

[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:11.280]
Hey, great.

[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:11.760]
Great show.

[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:12.300]
You're doing good.

[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:13.020]
See you later.

[00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:13.580]
Okay.

[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:16.460]
Let's play another request we had this morning.

[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:18.080]
Haven't heard this in a while.

[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:21.680]
There are two Miami cops with a hot two beans.

[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.360]
There on the streets fighting crime.

[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:25.260]
Hey, pops.

[00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:26.960]
That's a handicap face, air.

[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:28.540]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:31.020]
In Helen Dale Vice.

[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:32.820]
We got a problem.

[00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:34.900]
The gray gang is up to the oil tricks.

[00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:37.400]
We've seen it in that the group has seen your citizens

[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:40.280]
to win around trying to get the early bird special after seven.

[00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:41.580]
Yeah, they're back and down.

[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:42.760]
Let's go get them.

[00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:47.400]
Danes stop at nothing to clean up the streets.

[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:49.120]
Hey, lady, you can't cross.

[00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:50.760]
Here you'll have to cross at the light.

[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:54.160]
Man, they're determined to clean up the smuggling business.

[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:56.480]
All right, sister, you're under arrest.

[00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:59.640]
Also, now you're arresting my wife, watch the charge.

[00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:00.940]
Session of powder.

[00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:02.320]
Open that purse tub.

[00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:03.300]
Let's see that white stuff.

[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:05.200]
Yeah, just a thought.

[00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:07.340]
She's got over 100 bags in here.

[00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:08.120]
Of what?

[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:09.340]
Sweet and low.

[00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:11.640]
From that restaurant, she just came out of.

[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:12.980]
Let's take a man.

[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:15.900]
Yeah, it's Derek and Larry.

[00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:18.660]
In Miami Cubs on a hot new beach.

[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:20.820]
In Helen Dale Vice.

[00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:24.020]
Proveeering disfall on MBC.

[00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:26.560]
Okay, 742 now, Anzada.

[00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:29.220]
Dave, do you think I dare go back and talk to the chocolate lady?

[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:30.820]
Or should I wait?

[00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:33.540]
I don't, that's up to you.

[00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:36.700]
I'm not going to say it because it's pretty terminal to me.

[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:37.640]
It is?

[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:40.040]
It's like, you know, this repetitive phone call.

[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:42.640]
But you know, a lot of people probably want to hear from her.

[00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:43.620]
So maybe you should.

[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:44.900]
Do you really think it's repetitive?

[00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:47.820]
Well, hmm.

[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:50.420]
Okay, Dave County.

[00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:51.280]
Hi.

[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:52.260]
Hey.

[00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:53.660]
Hey, listen.

[00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:54.340]
Yeah.

[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.500]
Well, see, I got to ask you something.

[00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:58.000]
Okay.

[00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:00.900]
My sister's got a toe ladder melons.

[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:01.580]
A measure.

[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:02.240]
Uh-huh.

[00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:05.840]
But see, me myself, I like black women.

[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:09.760]
So when I go to start by, you know, national geographic.

[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:10.440]
Uh-huh.

[00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:12.900]
And also, I'm going to tell you a joke.

[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:15.780]
How can you, uh, an ECO P and P.

[00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:16.720]
Now, wait a minute.

[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:21.660]
Can you give us any, uh, stats on your sister, like, uh, height and weight or anything?

[00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:24.880]
Well, she's about 100 pounds or less.

[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:25.920]
100 pounds.

[00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:26.760]
Or less.

[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:27.340]
Uh-huh.

[00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:27.940]
Yeah.

[00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:31.620]
Do you ask you, uh, if you wanted to hear the cassette?

[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:33.760]
Do you have any idea how tall she is?

[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:35.160]
Yes, about 5.

[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:35.520]
5.

[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:35.740]
5.

[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:36.080]
6.

[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:37.080]
Let's put in 5.

[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:38.480]
6 and see what it comes up.

[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:38.880]

[00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:42.520]
Comes out to a 32-note cup.

[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:43.360]
32?

[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:46.040]
And you say that's not right, huh?

[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:47.580]
Huh?

[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:49.940]
You say it's, she thinks she's more than a 32?

[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:52.820]
She'd be swept by that amount.

[00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:54.840]
Okay.

[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:56.480]
Well, good luck to you.

[00:45:57.940 --> 00:45:59.060]
Chocolate syrup lady.

[00:45:59.420 --> 00:45:59.660]
Yes.

[00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:00.640]
You're still there.

[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:04.720]
Um, you're leaving Thursday for vacation?

[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:05.420]
That's good.

[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:07.680]
Thursday's my last day for 10 days.

[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:08.140]
Oh.

[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:09.040]
Are you going to be okay?

[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.400]
Yeah, I'm going to be fine because I'm going to be leaving too.

[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:13.600]
Where are you going?

[00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:14.680]
I'm not taking any.

[00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:16.600]
Any what?

[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:17.400]
I'll see.

[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:19.580]
Are you going to Kansas City?

[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:21.720]
I'm going to Kansas City.

[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:23.800]
And where the chocolate truck overturned?

[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:25.440]
I'm going to Kansas City.

[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:26.780]
You're going to Tennessee?

[00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:27.820]
Yeah.

[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:28.400]
All right.

[00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:29.480]
When will you be back?

[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:30.580]
Oh, guys.

[00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:31.420]
Next year.

[00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:32.980]
Next year, yeah.

[00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:34.040]
Okay.

[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:41.700]
Well, listen, I've enjoyed talking to you, but they seem to think you're repetitive around here, so I'm going to have to move along, okay?

[00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:42.020]
Oh, Dave.

[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:43.680]
Dave said that.

[00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:44.520]
Can you believe that?

[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:46.900]
Dave, I mean, serious.

[00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:54.720]
If you were laying down and you didn't have a shirt on, and I would have poured hot baby oil all over you.

[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:58.440]
Well, I am laying down with a shirt off, but that's what I always do this show.

[00:46:58.440 --> 00:46:59.480]
Oh, really?

[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:01.880]
On your back or on your stomach?

[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:05.980]
Do you really think she's repetitive?

[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:07.280]
Very.
