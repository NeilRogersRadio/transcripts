[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260]
any inside information but uh... all the information i get is that

[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.220]
that mike uh... has

[00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.480]
is turned so firmly implanted that uh...

[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.900]
that they love him over there so some reason trouble that uh... you know that

[00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.400]
that the bob richen and mike and he leave the shoes outside their office on

[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.680]
his breaks uh...

[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.100]
you know mike milicom's out and shines him up good and yeah

[00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.100]
anything else master and then runs back in indesence programs

[00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.820]
suppose that the guy doesn't belong on the air i mean i mean you you could

[00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.760]
know what they mean when they say mike Miller speaks with fork yeah i mean

[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.840]
over the years you know that i've been here before and i said well he isn't

[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.880]
that bad i was known for tall he's an embarrassing as there isn't

[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.880]
embarrassing he's an amiss every tiny

[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.180]
he's like amateur i'll be sure i'll be sure i'll be sure

[00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.780]
and you know this whole thing with the water you think they're not going to

[00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.560]
new york tomorrow because they haven't got them you know they got they've

[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.160]
probably got the secretaries over the assigning petitions like crazy so they have

[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.480]
at least a respectable number

[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.540]
he he had six weeks to ask people who could be opposed to bringing the

[00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.260]
super ball to my any any can't even get that done really

[00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.120]
so uh... i would say he'd be the one to go but now uh... if they put came to the

[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.160]
six that certainly would seem not right they've got sanding out and to two

[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.100]
wait a minute but let me ask you this question do you really believe that a

[00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.820]
guy who is making a lot of money

[00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.720]
and who is got a pretty firm position in the afternoon because he's got

[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.540]
really has had no competition do you think that he's going to leave one

[00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.740]
station and go to another for any amount forget the amount without ahead of

[00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.020]
having some agreement what time he's going to be on the air you really

[00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.460]
i do i think because of the kind of you know the kind of money he's paying them

[00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.020]
they do just about any you know he would he doesn't know i mean he's fairly

[00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.520]
honest with me i said you see this never lied to me unlike phala and he told me

[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.020]
honestly doesn't know he told me what he wants he says he wants to do two to six

[00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.460]
and he said that you know that that he's heard talk that they'd like them to do ten

[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.140]
to two and and i would both agree that that would be a mistake because you just

[00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.060]
don't fight you know your best cannon against your best cannon that doesn't

[00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.560]
make sense by the way in the next hour following cbs news at eleven i want all

[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.300]
you people even you radio people who are listening this morning to call

[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.760]
everyone you know because we have another major

[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.600]
coup and you're going to be here to cover it exclusively for the minibus

[00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.780]
what is that we have the debut of key west vice which is the

[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.200]
sequel to hellendale vice i thought it's him with with Steve called us with

[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.140]
that violators on air i think so what it yeah because i think he would call if

[00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.700]
it didn't i don't know well steve if you want to call out to jeopardize that

[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.520]
kind of call in but if steve does want to call we certainly we would put him

[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.340]
right on the air wouldn't we oh yeah if stand up we know that steve is

[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.520]
listening there's no question you can go to belicor bet your life oh he told

[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.880]
he told me to be listening well steve is a big fan of mine he won't admit it

[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.600]
and i do i thought he was listening for me i do forget that i do recall when i

[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.360]
first went on in the daytime he said in the beginning you thought it would be

[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.280]
real close neck and neck and that alan i would you know battle for the

[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.380]
audience then he later on retracted that said that i couldn't cut it in the

[00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.700]
daytime you know that all i had was those old condo commandos i wonder if he's

[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.400]
going to change his tune on that wait a minute if i can go on iod if he's employed

[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.180]
by nws y kuniko that's right excellent point i think the precedent was said

[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.240]
yesterday steve so if you want to call in we would certainly put you on the

[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.040]
air immediately for you to give us the load on in fact what other station in the

[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.860]
market would promote yes i mean means going to be on another station you might

[00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.640]
even be a competitor in this time slot but we have thick skin here we're not

[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:30.180]

de cipto school oh my god and days up they're getting my head shrunk great and uh i saw you on cn

[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:37.100]
any of that look like a little tiny head on this big body was incredible i haven't seen it yet i

[00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.840]
leaf alley gave me a tape and i haven't had a chance to play it although i don't think we can say

[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.200]
head on the year anymore can we oh really no listen i wanted i wanted before we started i want to

[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.720]
set the record straight on a couple of things please i'm set number one uh in in terms of my leaving

[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:58.080]
w n w f uh i was not unhappy at w n w s at all i in fact i really enjoyed working over there uh the

[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:05.300]
problems were financial between us and uh that was basically the reason i left the other thing which

[00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.720]
nobody can believe especially my wife is that i get along really well with leaf alley i know i'm

[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:16.280]
the only person in the world but uh leon i are friends i love it when it sounds like sand to get

[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.960]
along with them pretty well i have a different that very well could be yeah in fact if i were your

[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.460]
wife i'd be getting real nervous because you and leon sandy now that could be a real interesting

[00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:33.340]
trifecta there well she uh she thinks he's a vicious sadistic s o b and we're lorraine i get more

[00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.780]
very perceptive on his wife is the right on target or why i likely fall a bit smart i do and in fact

[00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.480]
i can't leave among i'm as friendly with leon as it's possibly possible to be with leon because he

[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.680]
doesn't let anybody too close but i think he's a i loved working for him i always got a line that

[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:54.080]
we never had any problems and the other thing is uh with all these terrible things you keep saying

[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:59.600]
about my cantony i've spent some time with him and he's a real gentleman a very nice guy and

[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.980]
a world that's a terrible rap comes from well i only speak from what i know it's gone on at that

[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.480]
station in the brutal way he's treated a lot of the people there it's a brutal business you know

[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:16.000]
tell you know that well yeah but it can be some humanity and if people uh get the views that i love it

[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.140]
what is this

[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:18.260]
hahaha

[00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:25.780]
this is a love fest ladies and gentlemen this is the right idea i gotta tell you it's it's fun being

[00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:29.320]
here i've been listening to the show every day i'm a i'm a i used to tell people on the

[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:34.060]
arm of talkaholic and when i'm not on i'm always listening and i love the direction you've taken

[00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:39.160]
the show it's really fun and exciting and entertainment philosophy of course is one that i

[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.860]
uh always believed in and uh think it's doing great and i congratulate you on your numbers

[00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:49.400]
thank you well what do you think of the fcc thing uh to tell you that you that initially when it

[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.840]
came out it was very very offended by it and very upset by it and i've spoken out in fact on a

[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:59.120]
couple television i'm so desperate to uh get rid of my creative juices i've had to resort to

[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.860]
television creative juayde man can you say creative juice out on this show no you guys have dirty

[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:10.300]
minds i can't believe that that's the fcc uh well but anyway i the more i see uh of the way

[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:14.820]
everything depends upon how station management across the country is going to deal with this thing

[00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:19.320]
the ruling in itself is sort of innocuous it's just a question of where they're going to go with it

[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.700]
in other words that they decide to clamp down and don't you think it'll have the chilling effect

[00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:27.640]
that the fcc wants it to have evidently it hasn't so far from what i'm hearing i was listening to

[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:33.360]
out this morning and he was reading something from the uh the broadcast publication saying that man

[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:39.880]
let's face it when a talk show is or or a you know a music show is very very successful you're talking

[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:45.880]
about hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars and uh arms was in fact nioh could tell you

[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.980]
about this i mean when you get uh you know when you get good numbers and you're very very strong

[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:55.320]
management i know management doesn't love nioh but uh how can you say that still because i know

[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.980]
you're not lovable when it comes to working with management but the fact is you're making them a

[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.900]
lot of money and they're not going to mess with you dick caster loves me i would have said something

[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:07.100]
else how would you like to work for a guy like lu crone right now i love lu crone lu crone

[00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:12.280]
one of the greatest guys i have ever worked the only man ever throw me out of a studio you're

[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:16.320]
kidding really oh yeah right on the air he threw me out i didn't know that what did you see must have

[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.800]
said something horrible i can't believe that steve is on here canonizing all of the radio douchebag

[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:25.260]
i can't believe this is incredible steve it was the day that nioh had the seeds and i was sitting

[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.660]
there just as an observer yeah that was growing came in he says i'm gonna have to ask you to leave now

[00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:34.640]
when i says i'm here he pointed there with my heart's mountain bird seed and lu was convinced

[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.480]
that it was pot seeds and was having a nervous breakdown that i was going to lose the license

[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:44.980]
i was right before i got here yeah but i i did one of these differences between deal and i's i

[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:50.440]
i am sort of a management kind of person i've been i started this business as a producer so i

[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.920]
understand a lot of management's problems and i've always i mean their exceptions i didn't get

[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:58.740]
along particularly well with neo rock off but steve you're gonna get along real well with mike nela the

[00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:03.300]
way you're talking well my husband but i mean i don't want to get you know kill him

[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:09.340]
i heard from the people in iod that steve was sharpening up his tongue for coming back on here but

[00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:14.640]
i didn't think they meant for this come on steve no he listen just because i'm an easy going guy

[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:20.800]
doesn't mean that i'm easy going guy well i will say this i must confess that when steve first came

[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:27.580]
to the market and i'm not really sure at what point it changed but steve was like a maniac i mean

[00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:32.980]
he was just like compulsive and hyper he almost is hyper asal and then all of a sudden something

[00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:38.500]
happened and i don't know whether it was uh the marriage or whether it was a leaf out or something

[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:45.600]
happened i heard you just became like mr mellow mr establishment it's just incredible i wouldn't

[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:50.240]
i wouldn't go that far almost i did go well i did go the the marriage did change me a lot of it was

[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:54.700]
very frustrated and angry and i just come off as very bad relationship when i got down here and i

[00:10:54.700 --> 00:11:00.440]
when i'm angry and frustrated i do have a tendency to take it out on my show you know but i uh

[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:05.700]
no i have meled somewhat but i mean i still know what it is to get nasty i think well what does that

[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:09.920]
mean is that mean when you come back on here we can expect which okay which steve can we expect

[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:15.260]
well i can tell you this the date county steve or the broward county steve i can tell you this i

[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:19.980]
can't i'm not going to be like i was in you know when i first got here because i'm not that person

[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:24.500]
anymore yeah but i can give you a little insight there's been a lot of speculation about whether

[00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:30.940]
you know w-i-o-d was going to tone me down and because they have had let's face it a very conservative

[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:37.820]
image boring yeah planned well i'm trying to terminal diplomatically but uh in my discussions with

[00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:43.020]
mike he is very anxious for me to uh you know he said you know whatever you want to do you just go

[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:48.320]
for it and they're not going to inhibit me and they want me to be as you know as outrageous as i

[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:53.720]
feel comfortable with being so there's going to be no censorship and no toning me down and i'm

[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:57.780]
kind of looking for that the other thing that i love me when i think you're about this too is you

[00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:04.420]
know there was a ever since you moved into mornings against now yes uh there was a moratorium

[00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:08.620]
passed on you know i'm going back and forth with you on the air and i'm attacking you or

[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:14.000]
yeah issue with you which i hate it because i mean i think some of the best shows that uh i've

[00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:18.860]
done i think you two i think we we enjoy playing off each other a lot and i love going after you

[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:23.880]
we're playing off figuratively say that yes figuratively speaking only when you say some of those

[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:28.020]
things that are uh perhaps you know now you need somebody to keep you in touch with reality

[00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:34.540]
and i was not allowed to do that and uh w-i-o-g they've taken the gloves off they say if you feel

[00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:39.520]
you know if Neil gets out of line you can feel free to go right after him so it'll be fun great

[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:43.900]
i know you look forward to that as much as i do okay now what what what what is this going to happen

[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:48.440]
in the morning or in the afternoon Steve at this time told you i spoke with time yesterday you still

[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:53.020]
up in the air i kind of see now i have difficulty believing that i mean i know you would not lead

[00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:57.260]
us down the line you i would not lie i know that but i but i just find it difficult to believe that

[00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.820]
you would negotiate and grant you their paying you a ton of money and i really mean it when i say

[00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:05.940]
more power to you because i i am what you say about management i'm not a management type person i

[00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:10.640]
think that most management in this business leads talent they get whatever they can out of you

[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:15.120]
and then when they're ready to scar you they couldn't kick her less what happens to you so i'm

[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.920]
delighted if you get a half a million more power to you but i can't believe that you would negotiate

[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:23.820]
that kind of a deal without knowing upfront when you were going to be on right to the country in fact

[00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:30.980]
Tom put it very very well uh when i negotiated the deal which i did which by the way i i feel and

[00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:35.340]
i agree with you and not not that management is ever what you would call blood me but i mean i

[00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:40.180]
think this is a business and i think you have to negotiate your worth otherwise you don't uh you

[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:44.300]
know they're i mean if if if uh w n w s could have hired me for twenty five thousand dollars

[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:49.400]
they would have been glad to do that yeah but i i think the salary thing uh i think it's something that

[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:54.100]
will benefit all of us because i i we have a ten as it was at time you said a great yeah the

[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:59.120]
rhino regans the rising tide lifts all the ships for sure yeah and i think it it certainly will

[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:06.060]
benefit all of these the major talent certainly in this area but uh yeah and i told uh Mike when

[00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:09.480]
what already has David Gold said he won't come back for a penny less than you make

[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:15.120]
hope he doesn't hang by his thumbs until that happens yeah but i hope he does in my discussions with

[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:20.420]
Mike Anthony and and you know he's a good i find Mike to be very open and and very very very i

[00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:26.480]
mean i have worked with him extensively but uh i i have uh he he's i told him i said listen i'd

[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:31.040]
be glad to tell you you know what i think but uh when you're getting paid this coming they don't

[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:35.520]
pay me this kind of money to make uh uh you know management decisions as far as i'm concerned

[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:40.160]
they want me to do overnight that this price up wasn't happy to so i really was not part of

[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.740]
what they do when they want to get rid of you what that's what they do when they want to get rid of you

[00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:50.540]
yeah well i i don't concern myself too much with that my feeling is that uh as much as i mean

[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:53.640]
this i mean there is a part of me that is always wanted to go up against you knew because i

[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:58.080]
think it'd be fun i think it'd be a good a good match but the point is why split that audience

[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:03.140]
in my i'm just giving you my thinking that's certainly not the management of iod necessarily but

[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:09.200]
the thing is if i go on i'll give this clamor convenient you know to have your audience join me

[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:15.300]
too but i mean that's that's that's what i leave tappy is what and leave tappy well i i might have

[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:20.340]
some problems with tappy i don't know it might be difficult by the way you are brutal to that poor lady

[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:26.200]
why we speak only the truth on this show it can you i've got to ask you this what is tappy like

[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:30.820]
off the air i got me off the air she's delightful we get along great she came in a two yesterday she

[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:35.420]
said i don't want you to think that it was me because i don't have any problem with anything you say

[00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:39.900]
and i think it's all very funny and so on and so forth she doesn't understand it's all you know i mean

[00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:47.060]
it exactly but uh no we get along great well it's it's interesting i gotta tell you it's it gets very

[00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:52.640]
why aren't you surprised to learn she was a black woman steve i heard that no i of course not

[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:57.300]
i got a matter of fact please you're related to robin quivers did you know that yeah i know yeah i

[00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:02.020]
got to be very honest i really don't i've i tried you know i tried to list everybody i can only make it

[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:06.520]
about five minutes into tappy shows and i keep tuning back hoping that something will happen that'll

[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:11.140]
hook me in but so far that has well what happened to leon the ratings i wonder because leon

[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:15.240]
had some serious problems in here in fact we might give steve the hour by hour breakdown you

[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.560]
know the book is in i'd love to hear that yeah would you like to hear it out for like from what

glow in the final touch and get more than a 1.9

[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.800]
let me let me stick up for my old station for a second please

[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:07.340]
i'm like i counted you for and i well i know you'll give me an out of

[00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:11.280]
tens or on this one that four point whatever it is the taffy god

[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:16.100]
now you know that is a spillover it's a spillover from your show

[00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:18.480]
plus that i just spent so much time attacking her in the

[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.160]
wait a minute in addition to which the demo you know the demos

[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:26.640]
67% of the young demographics all disappear at two o'clock on this station

[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:30.080]
i can believe that that's a true story for example men and women 18 to

[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:35.380]
34 in one o'clock hour we've got 9400 in the two o'clock hour we've got 3300

[00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:40.240]
now well that would take it okay now let's go to a 3 p.m. okay because this is

[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:45.920]
of some interest to you 3 p.m. taffy has a 4.1 w.i.o.d 2.5 and

[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.920]
w.s. news has at 3 p.m. a 3.0

[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:56.500]
unreal oh at four o'clock we have number doing news 3.2 i.o.d has a 2.7

[00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:02.520]
and snooze a 3.4 five o'clock w.i.n.z with a 3.4

[00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:07.840]
w.i.o.d with a 2.4 and w.s. news at 5 p.m. with a 4.0

[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:14.360]
that's the big hour at six o'clock wins with a 2.4 i.o.d with a 3.7

[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:20.380]
with sports talk and w.s. news with a 3.1 and then at seven o'clock

[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:24.860]
surely with a two then a two eight jerry with a five three a six six

[00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.300]
a 9.4 and a 12 9 in the midnight hour

[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:31.640]
well not a not a sterling book for w.s. that's for sure

[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:34.140]
and i have a feeling it's only going to get worse

[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:38.720]
oh fucking shit Steve you were over there has leaf out of ever high in anyone who

[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.820]
was successful well how do you know i mean it depends which

[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:47.880]
you mean by no is the answer i guess but i don't know i don't really

[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:51.140]
understand fully what they're doing over there other than i can give you a

[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:54.280]
couple of theories that are you know from the inside that people may not

[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:59.820]
realize they have an excellent sales department at w.s. and there is some

[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:02.800]
feelings you can understand something they view the

[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:07.700]
entity over there as a combo and of course when you've got the number one

[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:11.820]
FM station which generates massive amounts of revenue

[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:17.600]
well you know when you have a dead book at w.s.s. you kind of lean on your combo

[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:21.100]
figures and have a sales department at x1 over there that is able to

[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:25.200]
do that and they do not i can say from a business point of

[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.980]
view experience extreme variations in income

[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:36.360]
uh... uh... uh... for the station has the numbers on w.s.s. fluctuate up and down

[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:40.320]
so from a business point of view and basically i mean let's face it we uh... you

[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:45.160]
know we as performers and as listeners tend to view uh... the radio is

[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.660]
entertainment from a programming point of view but basically it is a

[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:51.920]
business and when you're doing practically as well uh... you know when you

[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:56.060]
have a good book as a bad book uh... it can you know can make it happen that's a

[00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:59.820]
cop at steve i mean that's like saying to white good winds twenty five games in

[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:03.040]
the next second picture wins five games you know saying well they won thirty

[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:06.140]
between them that's not bad i'm not you understand something i'm not giving

[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:09.140]
you my viewpoint i'm just telling you you know how they

[00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:14.880]
tend to view it at the station and there is also uh... some feeling of

[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:18.540]
white and i think this was it the root of the salary

[00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:23.200]
conflict that i was involved in with them they went to their sales manager

[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:27.040]
who quite frankly is not a dear friend of mine he was the only person over there

[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:30.000]
really didn't get along with that we were probably selling one and he was that's

[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.520]
well that no because they didn't really remember to get to involved in selling

[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:37.080]
under uh... mister lab i hear that steve you uh...

[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:42.280]
i had a little shot it took twenty minutes folks we finally got a little shot

[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:45.200]
from steve that's good there are people in the business i don't like i'll

[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:49.340]
have a few but i want to mention any names here but right at the top of the list

[00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:52.860]
but the point is i don't want you to do negative on the show steve if you want to be

[00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:56.140]
positive that's okay i don't believe in negative but the point is the story of

[00:22:56.140 --> 00:23:01.000]
that is that they went to steve liba and they said uh... do you need uh... you know

[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.060]
how important is that the steve can't be here from a financial point of view as

[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:07.760]
opposed to a programming point of view mister lapis said well we don't need steve

[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:11.360]
as long as i'm here we'll keep it sold out he's not important and evidently that

[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:14.980]
was at the root of their bargaining philosophy really and that's well that's the

[00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:18.820]
story of god and i assume it's true and i know he's deep what i can probably

[00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:24.500]
believe that and uh... that's why i'm no longer at uh... w n w s but uh... okay now

[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:28.420]
there's all this rumor about al being very a disenchanted with what's going on

[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.480]
and he and li have been sparring on the air

[00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:35.500]
and uh... if al should wind up leaving and going somewhere else and obviously

[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:39.780]
he certainly got the credentials to uh... go to a lot of places uh... that would

[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:40.900]
pretty much be the end wouldn't

[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:42.960]
well over

[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:47.380]
again it depends on the perspective you must understand this company was making

[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:51.540]
a lot of money when they had w g b s and we all agree on you know the effectiveness

[00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:56.980]
of uh... uh... w g b s is a talk they should so the point is they i don't know again

[00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:00.440]
you must understand i don't know any of that i'm just giving you my my feelings in

[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:05.860]
my intuitions there may be some feeling that it works scenario if they go back to

[00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:10.600]
a you know say i'll have to say uh... they you know they went back to uh... you know

[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:14.980]
that g b s level of of programming on uh... w n w s

[00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:19.820]
they still have a very viable and uh... you know i have money making operation

[00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:24.320]
and i think that the feeling may be why spend all this money for these expensive

[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:29.680]
salaries when we basically can generate similar again i don't agree with this but

[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:34.360]
this is what may be there thinking uh... why you spend all that money for salaries when

[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:37.860]
we can generate the same revenue uh... you know thanks to uh... very sick

[00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:40.660]
but you know where that kind of a philosophy eventually leads

[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:45.120]
to becomes a one five and they become one and then it becomes a point eight

[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:49.060]
i mean there's you know you can take the f m here the f m here a few years ago was

[00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:53.840]
doing sixes and sevens and eights and you know now it's down to one sixes and uh...

[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.980]
you know once you start that kind of a slide you say well you know we can make

[00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:00.460]
this much money it doesn't really matter when you when you when the bottom line

[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:04.300]
becomes the bottom line you eventually wind up going into the toilet and can i

[00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:08.640]
say that i don't know yeah i agree you know my orientation is programming and i've

[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:12.600]
used to have a fantasy of being involved in management putting together a station with

[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.860]
a jury Williams and Neil Rogers Steve can you know getting the top people in the

[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:19.820]
country and giving the you know the public all day long the best but again my

[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:24.920]
orientation is programming and uh... that's why i you know i have those feelings but

[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:30.180]
from the business point of view uh... Jefferson pilot has been successful in the past

[00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:33.500]
and that's another thing that you have to consider we view

[00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:37.460]
w-s-e-s the old story about the uh... the blind man

[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:41.140]
feeling the elephant tail and saying an elephant looks like a snake we view

[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:48.360]
uh... w-n-w-s as an entity down here in terms of this market uh... w-n-w-s is a tiny little

[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:55.120]
particle of Jefferson pilots uh... holdings and Jefferson pilot of course you know is

[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.280]
is worth it i mean it's just uh... company of tremendous wealth

[00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:03.260]
and sometimes the decisions that may be made again i don't know this i'm just

[00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:09.460]
going by a sense i have a feeling that the decision to keep my salary at the level

[00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:15.120]
that it was my feeling is was not made in Miami that it was a decision that was made

[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:19.100]
in Charlotte by Jefferson pilot who are not programming people and they don't really

[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:22.860]
understand uh... you know that their bottom line people and they think what they talent

[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:26.260]
over a hundred thousand they i have my understanding is they didn't the idea of

[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:29.100]
giving me the hundred thousand i was earning when they picked up my contract

[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:33.640]
uh... was outrageous to them i mean they had to because they inherited the contract

[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:38.520]
but these people not being in the programming end of the business don't really

[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:42.380]
understand that their bottom line insurance well what you're saying then is that

[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:45.040]
there's really not hope that they're gonna know much hope that they're gonna get

[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:48.640]
anyone very exciting over there and that probably explains why it's taken so

[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:52.560]
long to replace you well i wouldn't say that i mean there are you not gonna get

[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:57.560]
anyone very good that cheap well it's gonna be hard i mean there are you i mean when i came

[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:04.320]
down here from orlando my salary my starting salary was seventeen thousand dollars plus

[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:09.020]
ten dollars a life spot so i mean there are people out there that are good that perhaps have

[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:13.460]
not been discovered or whatever but it's hard to i mean there are not a lot of great talk to

[00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:18.320]
our hosts in the country and if you can say that again it is a very good people think it's easy

[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:23.660]
to just get up in front of a mic to be great at this business is very unusual and then

[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:29.320]
those of us who are at the top of it i think deserve the big bucks because when you go into any

[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:33.540]
business and you get to the you know the top five or six people in any business or in any field

[00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:38.780]
that's the kind of money they earn and it's hard to find i had a conversation with Lee

[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:43.340]
over the five still talk to power a lot and he was telling me you know that they're involved in

[00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:46.800]
this big talent search and he said oh there's a lot of telling he's there a lot of a lot of good

[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:50.660]
talk to our south there he's been listening to tapes and i told him i said lead there may be a

[00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:56.560]
lot of good ones but there are very few great ones and he had to concede that i mean it's it's a

[00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:01.600]
hard job to be great at amen well listen this has been a lot of fun on whether it's your call i

[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:05.560]
wish you the best of luck not too good but we wish you the best of luck uh it's good talking to

[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:45.020]
call taffy okay now after we do this break we're going to debut a new musical piece this is the

[00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:06.340]
here that's like the fm format a or r all over the road okay now let's talk a little bit about

[00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:10.240]
that and i understand a lot of this is in stuff and some of the people in the building get very

[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:14.540]
nervous and they're always telling me oh too much of this inside stuff the audience uh they can't

[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:19.240]
the audience doesn't care they love every minute of oh yeah i get close people before come on

[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:23.740]
you're gonna talk about the ratings or anything like yeah i mean even if we just make it up as we go

[00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:27.740]
along like lead us you know can you believe they're still playing the most listen to talk host

[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:33.520]
it's that's shameless that's absolutely shameless i i was gonna call him on it let last rating book

[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:38.260]
when they did it but uh to to continue it after two rating books i mean there only two rating

[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:43.520]
services birch and arbitron and both of them have the same result you know the latest the surveys

[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:47.520]
it's not even a contest allis so the fact that they're still playing that the beginning you would

[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:51.240]
think you would say to him i don't i mean yeah i respect that apparently he's beyond that

[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:55.200]
well i don't hear him talking about the numbers at all did you no oh yeah he was crying yesterday

[00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:00.700]
or the day before about how one rating book doesn't make a career and you just going on and on

[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:06.280]
how about two yeah or three uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh that's true that is

[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:10.040]
absolutely true and the ratings aren't precise and i'm not going to sit here and pretend that they are

[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:15.640]
but uh certainly they indicate a trend don't they they sure seem so and what it is is he's really

[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:20.220]
in an oasis over there i mean give you know despite all the kid in the run he really is the only talent

[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:24.060]
they have left over there i tell you one thing the only oasis that successful to mistone is rust

[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:30.360]
oasis over at the ad team but other than that being an oasis is a bad situation but he really is

[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:34.720]
he's the only one over there now that that's pulling any any kind of an audience and uh you know

[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:38.640]
you've heard him you can see he's got a five before you come on the air and if you aren't here he'd

[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:42.720]
probably out there very well when he's on a pose you've got a five two in the nine o'clock hour

[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:46.620]
last time you had a five six in an hour yeah and you can't say anything about look at the other one

[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:50.800]
say on a pose Cassandia was on in an hour but that's the next best thing to be on a one one one one

[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:54.960]
week she's on that hour and the next week she's on with micronary and the next week something else

[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:59.320]
is on there i mean you really do need a scorecard to keep what keep track of what's going on and i

[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:03.520]
do by the way you know what i saw a note yesterday interesting idea i don't know how well it'll work

[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:08.180]
w h anni up that used to be the country station carries the mess they're going all sports

[00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:12.320]
24 hours a day sports radio they're going to be the first one in the country with net grade i don't

[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.340]
think it's going to work very well that would be excellent for my can't think he's probably listening

[00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:20.580]
right now and there's a rumor that sports talk is going to be going four hours yeah i heard that six

[00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:26.280]
to ten yeah but it's not very often how many nights aren't there games they have a game on just

[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:30.780]
they don't understand though they had that fluke back in a fall because the dolphins in her canes

[00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:35.140]
were a big topic of conversation yep and they had that fluke for sports and Anthony comes

[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:39.620]
burrowing into town he looks at that and hey let's do 80 hours of sports talk this you know

[00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:43.200]
as well as i do this is not here there's nothing to talk about although i will say i did

[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:48.580]
two days ago we did a whole show on hockey well not a whole show i heard it but we never had

[00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:52.140]
an open line i mean it was incredible some of those names though are coming out there that uh

[00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:58.520]
you know dug mones and yeah johnny buce dug mones can you say that on here i don't know no it depends

[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:03.460]
what he's moaning about dug groan's dug makes guttural sounds perhaps but certainly not

[00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:09.900]
we can't even discuss how Terry search art died no please uh this is a family show although i

[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:17.960]
will say this in the teen column all across for wion z we have no teens zero and you know you're

[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:22.420]
an expert in your course they're in school now so in spite of this huge audience there are no

[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:27.300]
teens so jimma kine from the fcc or any of those other bureaucrats are listening uh we don't have

[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:31.440]
to concern ourselves with that now although what happens during the summer book i suppose you'll

[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:38.480]
have to turn your act out but don't probably listen to bon joe v in muremore well accept oh god

[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:42.500]
can you imagine the implications first they'll listen to that record then they'll actually be going

[00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:47.400]
out there and doing it go all the kid in the side that's really frightening i know it it really is

[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:51.500]
it's just and this is what i keep try to tell people with this fcc thing it's got nothing to do

[00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:56.160]
with howard stern it has nothing to do with shock radio it's got to do with the idea that all

[00:34:56.160 --> 00:35:00.860]
around us were surrounded by a group of right wing oppressive people who want a sensor

[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:05.520]
people who want to send other people how to live their lives they're not satisfied if they want to

[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:09.860]
live their own life in some oppressive manner and you know jen you're flexing every three seconds

[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:14.560]
guide love them they're entitled to do it but don't tell other people they have just reminded me we

[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:18.520]
don't subscribe to the summer book so you know cino evil here no evil we don't know i mean if we

[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:22.240]
got eight million people we don't know about it this is hard and this cost would made the point

[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:26.320]
the sunday in this column which you know for the people were in listen before was a wonderful column

[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:31.620]
it's they always find some justification and children are a great fallback we're protecting the

[00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:36.280]
children because who's going to come out against protecting children but in point of fact the kids

[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:40.200]
anything the kids are hearing on the radio they're hearing a lot worse in the school yachts anyone

[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:44.580]
who's ever been near a school knows that and a word's empty here i mean use them for a period of

[00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:48.080]
time to become meaningful well just for a good example you couldn't say rapin very you couldn't

[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:52.940]
say virgin impregnant the 10 years ago and remember when par said water closet yeah and then you

[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:57.780]
see one that leaving the air yeah water closet yeah the the reason i used the word rape you know the

[00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:03.180]
one the one absurdity lunacy in our whole language is that you can't say the f word

[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:08.860]
which to most people has a pleasant connotation well depending on how you yeah but you can say

[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:13.040]
rape which is ugly and violent disgusting and is essentially the same thing lots of you want to

[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:16.580]
figure that out and say rape on the year now there'd be one tall coasters who'd be off she would

[00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:20.980]
never show left yeah that's true she'd be out of question i never show left anyway oh come on

[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:25.320]
i what did surely do did i mention that before but i think i look at those seven and i numbers a two

[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:28.760]
at seven o'clock and a two-way to eight o'clock i guess you're right but you surely had to run out

[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:33.860]
for shaman after legal sand yesterday yeah i let me can i make a prediction because i really don't

[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:37.120]
know i just talked to a lot of different people in the business and i put all of rumors together

[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:43.020]
i think sandies out at i.o.d if she i should be on the show i'm doing at w.s news i'm not sure

[00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:47.260]
what hours i think she's going to wind up over there i think that steve will do ten to two and

[00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:52.020]
miller will do two to six and bill will be on at night and uh... and that's it i think that's

[00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:56.800]
going to be the i disagree i really do although i agree with the second part if she is out she'll be on

[00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:01.220]
in w.s as quickly as is a lot i don't know she has a no compete and i don't know if a no compete

[00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:06.560]
is valid if they get rid of you is it oh hey that's a whole different ballgame if she's an employee

[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:10.680]
and i didn't depend a contractor they can hold her doing on company even if they get rid of her

[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:15.900]
sure that doesn't seem right but anyway unless they have some kind of an agreement she would

[00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:22.480]
she'll be on n.w.s immediately upon leaving i.o.d except i happen to know that she she wants to stay at

[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:27.040]
i.o.d you're not dancing on a grave now are you no she was very indignant when she came back about

[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:31.500]
my dancing on a grave no i think i think that she'll be at i.o.d for a while for a number of reasons

[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:35.600]
i think that what happened the three days she was off there afraid of some kind of a backlash

[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:43.560]
and and secondly sandy has about nine years in change in in at i.o.d which is a cox company the same

[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:48.220]
company i work for and after ten years you get a wonderful pension that's really is happens to be

[00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:53.680]
true and so sandy it would it would she would be very foolish not to try and hang on there are you

[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:58.460]
hearing that sandy hang on well i and i she knows it how's the plastic surgeon doing by that

[00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:03.300]
was a terrible shot actually sandy said that and you stole it from her with another thing in this

[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:07.780]
rating book that really had i i know that people in the audience they listen to different kinds of

[00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:14.200]
radio and she and i say that are and and some are music for us wouldn't it be something if all

[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:19.620]
of this kind of like little creeks and river is met you know and they all turn out together well i

[00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:23.220]

you're the you guys are the only ones that have your own airplanes up there

[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:16.300]
what was that all about what was that all about who was that

[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:27.120]
oh he's on a traffic patrol we're just having that yeah okay yeah okay all kinds of hand signals here

[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:33.220]
all right all right i'm in the business so i know about that all right did you happen to see

[00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:39.940]
the McVealer report on Friday no you missed a good one they had the this is to do with the FCC

[00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:46.960]
and they had the the girl on there by the name of Diane killery she's the FCC attorney out of

[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:52.120]
Washington yeah she's a moron yeah you got that right yeah she was on a crossfire show with Kane yeah

[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:59.940]
uh her first comment was that quote organs that are offensive now what does that mean

[00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:05.100]
her mouth's offensive to me yeah she is she is patently offensive to me and everything she says

[00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:10.540]
is patently offensive i know it but it was so funny to look at it and all the things and it let's

[00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:16.540]
see i just got a few notes there the in you window this is talking about Howard Stern again

[00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:22.940]
yeah the double entendres the in you windows uh over the line to the extreme now what again does

[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:27.980]
that mean well who measures what's extreme that's the thing you got that right uh she then said well

[00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:33.440]
the children here in the audience the uh the radio station should be governed by congress

[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:41.360]
quote and unquote well in a roundabout way it is well in a very roundabout way well no congress

[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:47.600]
appropriates money for the FCC congress approves who's on the FCC uh that's that's uh in congress has

[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:52.100]
made its will known to the FCC in a number of cases yeah but you know she keeps using this line about

[00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:57.980]
the congress has spoken and so on and so forth the FCC act was last amended 53 years ago i would

[00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:02.460]
hardly say that that indicates that congress has spoken in regard to anything that has to do with

[00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:07.840]
contemporary broadcast standards right uh that 25 years ago and i first started in radio that

[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:12.100]
you couldn't even flesh a toilet on the air in fact one guy was fired because he did it yeah uh

[00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:17.300]
so this moment that only toilet flush ever in the history of broadcasting is on minachi bonka

[00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:22.660]
far as i know market forces otherwise meaning advertisers and you know average we're all in the

[00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:27.800]
advertising business and we've got to get a show over to get the numbers to uh you know raise

[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:35.620]
the advertising rates uh that should be made unlawful by congress uh again another quote uh

[00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:40.840]
well the interesting thing about this administration is that there and this FCC is that their entire

[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:45.240]
philosophy has been let the marketplace decide but that's only up to the point where the marketplace

[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:50.080]
decides what it agrees with apparently well of course but again where do you draw the line

[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:54.160]
i think the market is decided with niels numbers with how it stands numbers i think that's the

[00:42:54.160 --> 00:43:00.800]
marketplace deciding i agree and uh again children unreasonable risk no kids how do you kill

[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:06.940]
tell if kids are in the audience her response was that more kids listen to radio and during the day

[00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:12.260]
than are in school that's ridiculous i know it's ridiculous there aren't that many kids listen

[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:17.120]
to radio period spending an awful lot of money on education foolishly then maybe we just

[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:20.740]
started by every kid a transistor radio yeah either that or a television show well i'll be

[00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:23.880]
honest with you the response we got in the mail today and other we looked at it the second time

[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:28.180]
is pre-paltry and i'm i'm beginning to understand that if this campaign of mine is going to make it

[00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:32.140]
it's going to have to make it with help of people like lanceter and tampa and jury williams and

[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:36.200]
bossed in other parts of the country because the people here evidently most of them are too stupid

[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:40.040]
to understand the implications of it and you know it's really frustrating because you got this

[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:44.280]
gigantic audience out there i mean here these big numbers but again to try to get them to do something

[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:47.480]
that's another thing well they don't really think anything's going to happen it's going to have to

[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:51.300]
take you know someone in coming in here in brown shirts to pull you off the air and then they'll

[00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:55.380]
understand but again it's not just it's not just me it's not a question of whether i'm going to be

[00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:59.140]
on here or not or how it's turns going to be on here it's a question of whether next week the

[00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:03.100]
government decides that we can't speak out and criticize the president that we can't criticize

[00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:07.400]
religious it in that's all of these things okay i think it ended already because the response on

[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:10.820]
the phone here today this is embarrassing this is like that Friday night when tampa is out with me

[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:15.500]
about three years ago i mean i just don't believe the terrible look at the things going on and i know

[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:19.400]
it this is incredible it's like the whole audience is going into a coma now we've got two lines

[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:25.180]
open in each county and date six two four oh one nine one and in brown it's seven six four

[00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:31.920]
oh seven oh seven four lottery hello hello how are you okay great i have a couple of questions

[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:35.680]
this whole talk radio thing is kind of new to me after the United Kingdom where it's not really

[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:41.700]
that prevalent and what's been got on recently seems to be very very controversial because it

[00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:46.920]
would appear to me that the whole idea of talk radio is so the general public can view their

[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:54.140]
particular views on kind of events no no no i would have thought it would be a good medium for that

[00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:59.080]
well that's part i would imagine that's why you have the the telephone call and so the general

[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:03.760]
public could view their ideas but if you bear with me what i want to know is that a death on a

[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:07.820]
definitive policy on the words that cannot be used because it would appear to me again that

[00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:12.860]
anything can be misconstrued as a gesture for a painting of fencing depending upon the person

[00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:19.940]
who's listening to it you got people like linden russ who's right wing views could be you know

[00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:24.080]
described as paint layer fencing to anybody yeah well i that has to do with content the commission

[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:30.780]
says they don't care about content but does it about come back to the paint layer fencing no patently

[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:37.420]
offensive is in terms of sexual material oh yeah you can talk about killing sexual or

[00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:41.240]
expatory activities or organs that's what's patently offensive you get come on and and

[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:46.000]
shield for the clan and other disgusting organizations anti-semitic any racist comments or any

[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.300]
can't talk about sex that's okay but if you have any any discussion that has sexual innuendo

[00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:54.620]
and dealing with organs or expatory activities which is another way of saying you can't say

[00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:59.340]
sh on a year then they get all upset about it you know i i think this thing's being attacked maybe

[00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:03.680]
from the wrong perspective the the opening part of the first amendment is congress shall make no

[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:10.040]
regarding an establishment of religion and obviously these laws are based on religious taboos

[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:15.200]
they're not based on any kind of anything that makes any sense it's all based on religion the

[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:19.820]
christian religions that are now involved uh... are the ones who are pushing for these anti-sexual

[00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:24.240]
judge you can talk about all the violence you want you can put all the disgusting killing you want

[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:30.360]
but if you talk about sex you're sure that they have something to do with perhaps pms

[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:36.100]
you know pms or syndrome because that's obviously pertaining that's but sexual and excretar

[00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:41.420]
yeah you know you're obviously kind of like you know that the obvious answer is that we don't know

[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:46.280]
they get it made this vague and ambiguous ruling i've got it right in front of me from the fcc

[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:50.480]
and it's a you know they don't want to give you any specific so who the hell knows what we can talk

[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:54.560]
about well that's intentional and by making a vague and ambiguous you know what they're trying to do

[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:59.220]
is to intimidate a lot of broadcast there's a lot of license holders and to try to uh... you know

[00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:02.400]
force them to stop talking about things that they consider objectionable

[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:06.480]
just like the children's considers things objectionable on bumpers tickers you know it's so

[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:10.560]
basic it's so evident and the fact that the majority of people out there are you know again

[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:15.120]
brain dead they're in suspended animation they're not going to take any action you know this is a

[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:19.560]
classic example of how weak this country is i mean the government could they could actually come

[00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:22.560]
out tomorrow and say okay we're going to take away the first amendment

[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:26.380]
i don't know what people are thinking to be up to decide it about any uproads or whatever

[00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:30.980]
but it's all part of a pattern that you like you say you've got one group that wants to do away

[00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:34.640]
with t-shirts you've got another group that wants to do away with bumpers tickers you've got

[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:38.740]
another group that wants to control what's on the radio you've got a principle now in miramar who

[00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:42.780]
won't let it very innocuous song be played in senior prom at which a lot of the people there are

[00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:47.360]
legal adults in the state of florida where does it end they just chip away gradually and then you

[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:52.080]
wake up one morning and you find out you're not see germany again yeah got the several lines to open

[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:58.120]
in response today by the way sucks we have two open lines in brown and seven six four oh seven oh seven

[00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:03.320]
seven seven six four oh seven oh seven and we have one open line in date six two four oh one nine

[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:10.200]
one i just can't believe it homestead hello hi there's a movie that's been on movie channel this

[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:16.300]
way called Lenny about Lenny Bruce yeah it really is apropos what's happening now how is

[00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:21.920]
during is the modern day Lenny yeah it's absolutely and the thing about any Bruce was like in one

[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:27.040]
scene he talks about dirty words and he said I'll tell you what's dirty and then he described

[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:32.520]
several killings I think you talked about Kennedy's assassination you talked about segregation

[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:37.780]
and poverty so that's dirty and then you said the f word that's nice you know he said you could

[00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:42.140]
even greet your parents with it well like I said that and it really made me think about it for

[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:49.420]
a minute well as I said before I said many times and we're you know then we can listen to all the

[00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:54.880]
hate all the violence we want explain to me why you can't say rape and you can't say the f word yeah

[00:48:54.880 --> 00:49:00.240]
no one has ever been able to explain that to me 21 past 12 at w and z my guest is Tom jica the

[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:04.940]
radio tv editor the Miami news we're talking about radio about television about the FCC about the

[00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:09.700]
first amendment about the ratings about anything you want and we have an open line in each county

[00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:16.060]
in date county six two four oh one nine one and embroward seven six four oh seven oh seven

[00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:20.620]
and I really do mean it I mean a response today stinks the high heaven and again you know if there

[00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:23.720]
are people out there in the audience who think that I'm just going to drop the ball on the whole thing

[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:27.520]
even if they don't talk about that particular issue they've got nothing to say about anything

[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:31.040]
that's going on in the business which is incredible yeah this is the one the most exciting this is

[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:34.640]
and you know what this reminds me of I don't want to sound bitter but in a way I am because this

[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:39.400]
is happening every time every time after you I do well and which has been most of the time

[00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:43.520]
and the ratings come out and I don't think I overdo it I mean we do talk about it whether the good

[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:48.160]
bad or indifferent we've always done that on the show and it's like okay sit there and stew and

[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:52.000]
now we're you know we're just not going to talk to you this happened to be like a half a dozen

[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.400]
times in this market yeah and it seems to be an interesting ratings I certainly get enough calls

[00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:59.940]
on and people are always asking when they're coming out yeah well I guess they're all they're all

[00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:05.040]
playing a hard to get today I don't know 22 minutes past 12 at W I N C let's do a little break

[00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:13.940]
here 25 past noon at W I N C Tom jiff is here I'm here we're kind of in a coma I don't want to

[00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:18.520]
steal Al's material but we're in a coma and we have another radio celebrity standing by on the

[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:24.980]
line good morning mr. Tanner I hate that to do now good good evening how are yours mine are

[00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:31.040]
where they were when I got up this morning yeah well that's good you know I um I think you're

[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:35.000]
right about this business that people being in a coma about this whole first amendment thing

[00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:40.700]
and I think the only way you're going to stir up enough trouble to get them excited is to

[00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:48.200]
point out that there are so many things in danger beside Neil Rogers and Howard Stern Howard Stern

[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:53.220]
is an indis-market it's sort of an abstraction to these people and you're exactly right because

[00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:59.080]
all this is leading down a road where none of us wanted to go where your listeners don't want it to

[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:05.020]
go and the road is paved with apathy just that simple yeah some other words I don't have to feel bad

[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:09.180]
you're getting the same response well well as Neil pointed out here a couple of days ago that

[00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:13.780]
people kind of thought that Hitler was just an amusing little oddity now you know and his early

[00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:18.140]
oh yeah well I just don't pay attention to him and he'll go away well it's all because the

[00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:22.700]
fact of the matter is that there are a lot of interesting things going on in the government today

[00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:27.320]
while we're so busy concerned concerning ourselves with all of our north and people like that did

[00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:33.160]
general C-Cord and so forth nobody's concerned with GE quietly gobbled up their biggest

[00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:38.080]
competitor for a defense contracting business RCA and in the process just happened to get the

[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:43.680]
number one television network there's a lot of things going on the people really ought to wake

[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:49.100]
up and pay attention to and that's that's on the one side of the issue side of what I wanted to

[00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:52.820]
come in on another side of the ratings I've been listening to you guys talking about the album

[00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:57.920]
rock situation here's the whole story with album rock album rock has never been that popular in

[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:02.800]
South Florida the reason that she did well is because it's only one of the kind there's always been

[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:08.060]
about six and a half shares of album rock back in the old data four versus she days she had a

[00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:12.580]
four they had a three yeah Bill but nobody's doing progressive album rock here there is no station

[00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:18.380]
because they're all caught up in classic rock Tom they're all trying to go for demographics you

[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:23.020]
know and and that's fine I think it's an interesting point Neil Rogers and I have one thing in

[00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:27.020]
color and we play for whoever the hell wants to listen to the radio I don't care if there it

[00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:32.940]
Neil has 18 year olds or 68 year olds and I don't care if I do either I have a lot of teens he

[00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:36.760]
has a lot of older people who cares it's warm bodies you want people to listen to the radio

[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:41.900]
uh it's up to the sales guys that get out there and market this stuff to dissect it and uh

[00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:48.160]
feed it to the agencies like Pablo well it's still it you have to wonder someone came up walked

[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:52.120]
in here a few minutes ago and came up with an interesting theory that what's happening now to

[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:56.380]
music on radio is what's happened to television to a certain extent people are listening to their

[00:52:56.380 --> 00:53:05.140]
own cassettes that's also true uh in reality dance and rhythm based music has always been uh very

[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:10.820]
very very important part of the local music scene in the 15 years that I've been doing music

[00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:15.720]
radio down here that's what it was at y 100 when y 100 got away from that their ratings went

[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:20.500]
down the drain what they did this time is you so aptly ported out your column uh I think they

[00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:23.660]
have made some improvements in their station but basically they bought the book they paid a quarter

[00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:27.560]
of a million dollars for a contest it says they've been doing it in one twenty five thousand

[00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:33.160]
that's how they put themselves on the f 15 years ago yeah right it worked then it will work every

[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:39.420]
it's working less and less well less and less efficiently um as far as hot 105 is concerned

[00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:43.640]
their problem has been reason they wanted I think uh to make the change with me that they did

[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:47.220]
is they want to learn the thing from out of town and I think you folks are with their w i and z

[00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:50.840]
know about people from Maine who come in into Miami airport and freak out because they see

[00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:57.380]
his fanics and black standing around yeah and uh the reality of the situation is that if you don't

[00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:02.100]
live and work in Miami you don't know a damn thing about the radio down here and you're probably

[00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:07.540]
going to lose out his bed is w i n c f m has a good name was on whatever it is today joke can was on

[00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:11.400]
the talk of stepping down the radio dial that are caused by ignoring the fact that this is not

[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:15.320]
Kansas City Kansas well that's what that's what can was saying about Jefferson pilot running

[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:21.500]
uh w n w s from north carolina and they have no idea what's going on down here this is a unique

[00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:25.940]
city and I happen to think that Miami South Florida which is a media term if you will Miami

[00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:32.460]
Ford Law to Dale uh it's unique I have had it exciting I think it's a a robbing city and I think

[00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:36.900]
it's a challenge to be driving I don't know we could be getting in trouble with that if you think

[00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:43.040]
you're going to uh force Charlotte North Carolina radio down these people's roads and have them

[00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:49.760]
get ratings you I mean the result of that Bill this is Glenn Hill how you doing hey Glenn how are you

[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:56.540]
real good um I just wanted to ask you Neil has been wondering for quite a long time on the air

[00:54:56.540 --> 00:55:03.600]
whatever happened to Casey well Casey had his Lancet record in 1980 and then he had well actually

[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:10.020]
not true he had uh sort of a medium-sized hit record while I was in Washington around 1984 and

[00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:17.840]
I speak to him from time to time uh I think what has happened is he simply lost the inspiration to do

[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:24.060]
his music um well I don't know it seems to me he's just another one of these one hit stars are you

[00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:28.080]
are he had a gun in him to it's two of these two of these we had the longest string of number one

[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:33.200]
record since the Beatles is that right yeah why they're right by me he's not a one hit artist but he's

[00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:39.080]
artist who likes inspiration and who amongst us can say what it takes uh to provide inspiration

[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:43.560]
whether you're a talk show host or a recording artist you you've got to get the uh the juice from

[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:47.740]
somewhere who well he just he just happened to be in the right place with disco music when disco

[00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:52.460]
is hot and fortunately it went went by the wayside rather quickly well actually I disagree with you

[00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:56.180]
I think it never went away here in Miami it's alive and well and we're just calling it something else

[00:55:56.720 --> 00:56:00.600]
well I I know what I call it I know we can't say that on the air

[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:04.260]
y'all lives in Chicago but is here in Miami in spirit this morning

[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:09.080]
can't believe it yeah I certainly think one thing that I was listening to you guys I don't

[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:12.820]
happen to have a copy of the book because I may not have come you know until we like four or five

[00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:17.220]
days later by pony express or something but um I was listening to your album I always

[00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:21.400]
it's incredible you don't see that sort of personality pool that Neil Rogers has

[00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:25.280]
but listen the audience I mean this is the first day the book just came in this morning at 930

[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:30.140]
and the audience is already getting even now so don't ever get cocky in this market I don't

[00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:34.600]
know if I can say that but don't ever get overconfident because man immediately they turn on you

[00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:38.680]
now you know what you provide you provide entertainment rest that stuff is boring

[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:43.840]
yeah you can say that again say it again one the way not listening to your

[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:48.460]
you and uh good talking to you Bill look before it to the mo hill to that okay okay good

[00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:53.780]
lie out okay 1232 at w i n z we have an open line in brown or if there's anybody alive

[00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:58.800]
there 764 0707 Davie hello oh well brown and red amazing

[00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:02.960]
yeah frightening yeah those other stations are boring

[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:10.720]
I just really start I know that's probably the difficulty there's so much going on people

[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:14.660]
just can't figure out where to start now I'm finding yourself in a motel at Tammy Baker

[00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:18.740]
yeah now please take out just a script of face off

[00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:25.600]
um I haven't tried to get people to sign the petition and they're like well what's this for

[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:31.040]
I explained to them what the FCC is trying to do and how it's the first step in in

[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:37.000]
restriction of our personnel rights and they're like yeah well and then they're so

[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:40.420]
empathetic they're like yeah well maybe I'll sign it I'll think I'll think about it yeah I think

[00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:44.440]
the word is dumb I think you're being kind when you say empathetic they're just too stupid to

[00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:50.300]
understand what the implications are I know it's unreal then saying what the principal of Miramar

[00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:55.620]
yeah now I heard that song you play that's pretty boring song yeah certainly not controversial

[00:57:56.200 --> 00:58:01.080]
um I don't I don't see where they they can get on their high horse and tell students to do that

[00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:06.840]
um that he had somebody on yesterday the day before from uh school board by our county yeah

[00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:12.340]
and they got on this thing about dress codes for students and teachers and he says he doesn't

[00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:17.540]
think teachers should have a dress code but students definitely should and I don't see the logic

[00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:21.760]
in that why should it go for one group and not the other well that seems to be the way alive here

[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:27.660]
if one one group of people telling another group had a behavior don't do as I do do as I say isn't

[00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:34.300]
that what the Tammy and Jim thing is all about exactly exactly yeah I don't see how these people

[00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:39.420]
can live with themselves though why is it time after time after time that the people who are most

[00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:42.900]
specific about telling others to live are the ones who get caught in the back seat of college with

[00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:49.520]
eight euro kids why is that I was afraid of everybody being like them maybe they don't like themselves

[00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:54.300]
well I think they're trying to focus attention on everybody else they're trying to shine the spotlight

[00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:59.020]
everybody else in the meantime you know do all of their stuff in the dark you'll allow me thank you

[00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:06.620]
death protest too much right yeah I don't know how this ties in with the FC ruling but a lot of

[00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:13.720]
record companies and lobbying Congress for years to restrict home taping and

[00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:19.060]
restrict in the import to these new digital tape reporters in the street and

[00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:24.540]
pan i said you know most people are listening to tapes at home and that's what I do and that's

[00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:28.780]
the record company keeps saying well if you you let them tape whatever they want we're going to

[00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:35.040]
lose so much money and that's just a lot of BS because I do a lot of taping because I like to listen

[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:42.820]
to my own music I don't like to listen to that damn thing to trash and I have five five of those

[00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:49.100]
crates those teach craze filled with records because I buy some money to make my own tapes up

[00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:54.860]
you know I'll go out and buy a complete album for one or two songs on the album now so I

[00:59:54.860 --> 01:00:00.180]
I the fact that I taped makes me spend more money rather than left you know because I don't go

[01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:05.920]
and try to get pirated copies and I think that that's another thing that needs to be looked into

[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:10.620]
is all this lobbying by these companies well the movie industry when vcs came along for it and

[01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:15.400]
fought and wanted out wanted to outlaw vcs then wanted to tax them and it's turned out the vcs

[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:18.580]
are the best thing that ever happened to the movie industry now because they've got a whole

[01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:23.140]
another market there that didn't exist before yeah people are basically honest there's always

[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:28.840]
going to be some dishonest people but most people are honest and then they're not going to rip you off

[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:36.320]
I know okay there's a question here yeah um the rating you you had some of the information a couple

[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:41.640]
days ago and then you had to break down by the hours today why do they send them separately why

[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:46.940]
don't they just send them all at once well that's a good question I really don't know that I don't

[01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:50.700]
know how they go about putting the book together but they're you know they put everything into a

[01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:53.940]
computer up there in beltsville merrill and then I'm sure that there's certain things that come out

[01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:58.340]
first before they actually print them up and then they put a whole book together yeah it's

[01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:02.600]
a luminous amounts of information I'm looking at a sheath here almost as big as the telephone book

[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:08.480]
and it's like a baseball game when when the when the score first comes in over the yservic first

[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:11.760]
they give you the score then they give you the lion's score and then they give you the box score it

[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:17.400]
just takes time to put the box score together the full book is like the box score is that that phone

[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:22.520]
size pack you got there that's just for Miami area yeah just for the stations in this market wow

[01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:28.260]
it's unbelievable yeah well we're only about four million of them okay listen don't give up keep

[01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:33.200]
plugging away for us I will one of the reasons why I think you might not be having a lot of people

[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:38.180]
calling today at the end of the month people get paid people trying to do end a month business

[01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:42.820]
or something that might be the reason why that's an interesting theory hey listen if that's true

[01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:46.460]
I'm gonna take off the end of the month every month that's a good idea all right have a nice week

[01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:51.000]

[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:07.900]
celebrity color on the line this can't really be Greg Budell can it yes it can sure sounds like

[01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:12.760]
Greg Budell it's me how you doing private citizen Greg Budell right I'm not sure if I want to become

[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:16.900]
a decent mechanic or go to the front you're here with taffy all these people in no compates are

[01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:21.020]
coming up it's in this amazing you could maybe do a show I know can get a lot of litigation

[01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:25.580]
from this show yeah I thought that having a six month pay vacation would be a lot of fun but at

[01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:30.320]
this point I've got a little less than two months left it really stinks well I'll tell you what

[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:34.260]
if you'd like to try out if you want to come in here and you can make some arrangements I'd

[01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:38.760]
love to take the next two months off yeah hey the rest on my laurels now I mean I certainly

[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:42.420]
can't improve on these numbers so I'd like to take a couple of months off you'll just pay me and

[01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:46.940]
come in here do the show congratulations you deserve those numbers I think it says a lot for

[01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:52.260]
being yourself on the radio I think that's the thing that makes you different the illicit I don't

[01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:56.780]
believe there's any contrived or any phoniness in what you do thank you and it's kept me sane I have

[01:02:56.780 --> 01:03:02.720]
laughed my I think it's one of those body parts that can give us trouble off the last few months

[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:07.900]
it's really been fun I as a matter of fact I saw somebody ran into Greg the other day and they

[01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:14.500]
said he was missing no so now we know where when he laughed it off just about by the way I can't

[01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:18.680]
take you up on your offer because you said something a wind of thorn a while back she has

[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:23.400]
suggested considering a move in the talk radio and with with your when you reacted the way you did

[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:29.740]
I immediately ruled out any career in the tacos why because it takes you it said hey buddy why

[01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:34.900]
is there be a taco or something like that that doesn't mean you couldn't do it no I just get

[01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:39.220]
nervous when I hear people like Joe Johnson is it an example I like Joe he's a great guy yeah but

[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:43.280]
the all the way does take shots at jikka times looking with a real sour low so he's maybe not so

[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:50.260]
great a guy he's a decent well he's a guy and I'm fine the bottom line is Joe is not a talk show host

[01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:57.700]
no he's never going to be I will be there may 16th I've been working as a private citizen and

[01:03:57.700 --> 01:04:02.400]
you know this is a frustrating thing because I would be railing on this if I were on the air but

[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:06.760]
well when my time comes I'll do it by the way I forgot to mention Tanner it slipped right by me

[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:10.880]
said emerald hills and I guess somebody hasn't told him but we're doing it here at the station

[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:15.700]
and wind so I'm glad that you just mentioned that again yeah it was good to hear him too today yeah

[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:20.400]
and keep on man it's great hey listen Greg you're going to be doing a music station what are you

[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:25.160]
going to do to turn it around I just talking about it all morning what's going on in music in this

[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:31.460]
market you know it's just it's disgusting I have some real strong opinions on it I don't know how

[01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:38.660]
much I can say without jeopardizing my situation right now but everybody is researching things

[01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:43.600]
three dimensionally to find out you know how many dwarfs like this on yeah let's take another study

[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:48.180]
let's call Frank maggot and take another study for 20 grand I think consultants are the

[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:53.360]
the ruination of the business they've taken the creativity out of it yeah and I expect I mean

[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:58.800]
this is a business of feelings and emotions and I expect to use a lot of that when I get over

[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:04.680]
to where I'm going next and well where is the music audience gone pardon me where has the

[01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:10.120]
music audience gone I'm just a parent well Neil has shown that you can entertain people without

[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:15.500]
playing and sawing I think that you know what I'm looking forward to for myself is being able to

[01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:19.960]
play to the audience and not to the station management for the first time in seven years that'll be

[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:23.920]
it I think a big change for me the music audience I think it's just you know they all say you go

[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:27.680]
out there and they all say the same thing everybody's playing the same song they're playing them

[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:33.680]
over and over and over again I mean you know you're the inspiration by Chicago how many times can

[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:38.700]
you hear that before you gag on it well it does it you know power did very well this time is

[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:45.440]
personality DJs coming back I think so I think the trouble is there's very few people that can go

[01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:51.300]
on the radio it really be themselves the personality you know everybody's got to be in an

[01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:56.440]
out there and they've got to talk like this and you know I mean there's so much phoneiness on it

[01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:03.960]
sucks yeah I don't think you can say that but I'll say it does suck you're right well I appreciate that

[01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:10.060]
Neil and I enjoyed that well I wanted to disprove what you said we didn't eat little music on the show

[01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:16.300]
I mean we would be naked with that little bit it goes well yeah those violins make it loud

[01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:20.700]
yeah

[01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:23.820]

from yeah and we'll look for you on the 16 okay and the done agony says hello thank you okay

[01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:03.640]
well this is really something the audience doesn't want to talk to us but all the radio people want

[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:08.500]
to talk that's what I'll screw the audience you know yeah let them stick it where the moon don't shine

[01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:15.720]
mirror mar hello celebrity talk hi hi I have a question directed to Tom Tick a please yes

[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:23.000]
okay I read a column a few weeks ago about Tom like us yes either coming back with his wife and yeah

[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:30.300]
I understand that he's neither coming back nor is married well if he's not married he lied to me

[01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:36.580]
he is married and as far as I'm coming back he's not no from what I hear as he used that he used

[01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:42.200]
w a w s here is leverage to get a better contract than I was on it I see I was

[01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:47.720]
um it's wondering about you're in Miramar right yeah did you go to Miramar high no you have kids

[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:51.480]
who go to Miramar high I went to my only beach I well what do you think of this whole thing with

[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:56.280]
this principle I think it's terrible I really I mean you know I wasn't going to comment on that

[01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:59.860]
situation when you live in the community why don't you do something about it I work here I'm

[01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:04.460]
I'm going from work well if I live in that community I'm gonna talk to his lady she doesn't

[01:08:04.460 --> 01:08:10.860]
live in Miramar yeah I mean you're where does it stop we know where we know how it starts

[01:08:10.860 --> 01:08:15.120]
you know only cringe it where it's gonna stop hey this is really the first stop

[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:19.800]
right of it because I don't have children there I didn't know about this I really didn't and it's

[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:24.480]
really an innocuous song the worst things in it are the suggestions that that kids might actually

[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:29.720]
drink beer and and and fool around in the backseat of the car and all it really says is fool around

[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:34.660]
and uh no it's terrible because you know in elementary school they're taking Judy

[01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:39.580]
blue books off the shelf I mean we're trying to do that as long as the community lets them they

[01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:44.460]
will I think they ought to take judge blue them off the shelf or put them on the shelf yeah no it's

[01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:49.360]
very bad it should be stopped I today which is I didn't know about it no one ever approached me about

[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:55.020]
it and I definitely signed a petition against that well will you send in for one sure please I

[01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:58.720]
guess they can't play in I'll give you the address again in a little bit okay they won't be playing

[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:03.700]
Bruce Springsteen's born to run at that prom no I believe that your legs around my velvet are they're

[01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:10.480]
gonna be playing Bruce Springsteen's born in the USSR yeah in Miramar a bunch of commie fascist pigs

[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:18.020]
over there yeah now send the application to send the form okay thanks okay bye bye okay yeah all of

[01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:21.800]
these things couldn't exist that they all feed on each other when when one of them happens it

[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:28.480]
makes it a little bit easier to do the next one for lottery hello hi Neil hi um I'm 21 and I

[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:32.680]
just wanted your management to know that you do have young listeners big basically because the

[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:37.680]
the music stations in the town totally suck suck is the word right yeah it's it's really horrible

[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:42.260]
but we're gonna start a new FM we're gonna have new colliders for the FM WSUK that probably go

[01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:47.200]
over really good yeah um what were the numbers like for for the music stations what what was the

[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:51.800]
number one probably why they were almost all down powering up a little bit but almost all the

[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:59.200]
others were down she was genetically G.C.R was down the FM here was down the power went up

[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:05.280]
maxi waxi was down a little bit power went up and hot what a hot two went down a little bit

[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:09.420]
yeah went down pretty good but yeah really yeah that's about the only other station I listened to

[01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:14.180]
I drive a lot so I just got so sick of these these fake like like Greg Budeau was saying these fake

[01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:19.060]
people on the air and hey there it is it does it does so I just was playing around with the radio

[01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:23.280]
one day and ran across Neil that was several months going I just leave the dial right there on

[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:28.040]
94 unless Taffy McCallum comes down a minute that's one of five for a couple hours well the problem

[01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:33.560]
is that all these can solve it as Budeau said they all try and find this one typical person in

[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:40.260]
program the station charm and nobody is typical yeah yeah it's it's really hey to use the word

[01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:46.660]
but it sucks yeah sucks um Neil that that little spot about uh Cammy Faze new album yeah are you

[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:51.300]
playing that today that's hysterical isn't it it's hilarious oh you mean that well that's really

[01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:56.500]
a commercial for Tammy Faze new album I think that's in the next break hey um along those lines did

[01:10:56.500 --> 01:11:01.700]
you know that and he is is coming out the new album Anita Bryant really yeah I just got my copy of

[01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:06.380]
the uh the weekly news here and I'm reading all about it oh the weekly news does not recognize this

[01:11:06.380 --> 01:11:10.380]
program this is like red china they don't recognize I know that's really terrible um I run into jack

[01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:16.280]
31st a while out and about and last time with your car with your car yeah I'd like to

[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:20.240]
I ran into him a couple weeks ago and I I said hey what's going on with you and Neil leave

[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:24.240]
Neil alone he's a good guy you know he never told a great train and what did he say he says I

[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:27.960]
don't even want to talk about him he wouldn't even talk about the subject of Y and Z with me

[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:31.220]
well what did you do to him Neil really tell you one thing you get on the wrong side of one of

[01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:36.040]
those wild queens and it just uh I put up her skirt or something exactly by that on the wrong side

[01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:43.580]
no Anita's new album just once in a while it's called Anita with love and it's a pop gospel album and

[01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:49.360]
get the it's produced by her own company in Atlanta called beta lambda corporation oh yeah right

[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:55.440]
I'm serious is that you serious boy if she only knew if she only knew I mean as long as you brought it

[01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:59.880]
up I wasn't going to mention this but Anita Brian is really taffy McCallum yes I believe that

[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:05.560]
with breasts a black tape a black Anita right right yeah Anita is black didn't you know that no I

[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:09.760]
didn't I you got to do something about her and well not you your station does this I talked to her

[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:13.320]
a couple weeks ago on the phone just because well no wait a minute today's the golden chance will

[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:17.860]
the real taffy McCallum please stand up as your topic today and she actually is inviting the

[01:12:17.860 --> 01:12:21.900]
audience to call in and ask her anything so you can ask her where she comes up with these boring

[01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:26.100]
subjects and when she's going to get off the backs of all the minorities and when she's going

[01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:30.800]
to start doing a show the thing that the thing that I would do I mean it's the thing that she would

[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:35.000]
do if I call them said anything like that well yeah that's an interesting point and on and on

[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.020]
and then she hang it sure something to think about you know you know if it's a play case her collar

[01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:43.160]
she won't she won't get an argument with anybody yeah like you like if you said shouldn't we fry

[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:46.780]
everybody who's got the AIDS virus she would say well it's certainly something to think about

[01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:51.400]
yeah exactly especially if you said fry that would really get it going yeah well back when

[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:56.560]
then Smith college we used to talk about that a lot and yeah she's such a total waste of time I

[01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:02.400]
hate to say but I think I'd rather listen to the guy over on the other station but I said I

[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:06.220]
listen to hot 105 when she's on could you imagine if John Brown and Taffy McCallum had children

[01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:12.720]
that would be a does it would just be discussed which he gets and test to babies probably Dr. Mangle

[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:17.640]
would have got that well listen we got a run we got an important message from Tammy fam will
