[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160]
If you could tell me the next time Stan made this going to be at the house, I'm going to bring over an exorcist and get that Miami Vice-Sort of

[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.780]
He was disgusting.

[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.820]
I hate him.

[00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.460]
I mean, just because you're not there to discipline him, he went overboard.

[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.120]
Is he back on that crap again?

[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.000]
Oh, yeah.

[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.560]
He played Don Johnson, he was rolling on the floor, he was making strange sounds.

[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.120]
Yeah.

[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.640]
Our stars are saying stop them, please.

[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.380]
Well, me, I've tried talking to him for months about it.

[00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.300]
He's obsessed, sir.

[00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.140]
But you got to hear him.

[00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.780]
Yeah, that's a good idea.

[00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:34.740]
That is a good idea.

[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.640]
Thanks, human.

[00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.160]
That tape you play with that weapon stuff.

[00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.660]
Yeah.

[00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.020]
You got to hear him like that.

[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.620]
There you go.

[00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.520]
Sounds like a good idea.

[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.180]
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, here it is.

[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.480]
The Stan Major Cure.

[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.440]
Oh.

[00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.500]
Oh.

[00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.640]
There you go.

[00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:49.920]
Okay, so you have a wonderful day.

[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.720]
Thanks a lot.

[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.700]
Oh.

[00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.660]
No changes, man.

[00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.300]
The only problem is he'd enjoy it.

[00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.860]
Yeah, it's a good thing, very good.

[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.880]
You know, the fantasizing that Don is doing the whip.

[00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.300]

[00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.120]
Oh, Don, whip me.

[00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.900]
I can't stand it.

[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.560]
Come on, Stan.

[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.720]
Vouch up a little, will you, please.
