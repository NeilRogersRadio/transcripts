[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940]
Hallelujah, good morning. It's the Neil Rogers show and WZTM, I'm the beach, four-lotted

[00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.640]
ale in the Palm beaches. Good morning, Neil.

[00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.920]
What's Gary Hurt doing tonight? And who are mine's wanton?

[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.320]
Wiring mines read the Miami hero. Is Maurice Farray really having sex with an alien from

[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.920]
outer space? It's in the hero. Is Paula Hawkins the true mother of the elephant man?

[00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.520]
It's in the hero. Is John Kennedy sleeping with Max Henry? It's in the hero. Is Jim Baker

[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.680]
about to give birthday Jerry fallbells baby? It's in the hero. Sex, sex, sex, more hot sex.

[00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.280]
Oh, it's in the hero. Plus Gary Hurt's amazing right style from Florida.

[00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.080]
A crossword puzzle that has no answers. Our own punitive practice just for us.

[00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.160]
I had pubs and love letters to Neil Rogers. And we're so sorry Uncle Albert but we haven't heard a bloody thing all day.

[00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.500]
Miley's Fab Lake rhetoric. It's all in the latest issue of the Miami hero.

[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.800]
Available at supermarket checkout counters everywhere. And where finer manure is spread.

[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.840]
Okay, I wanted to make sure that the people of the hero knew right off the bat.

[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.720]
We weren't going to waste any time. You know what I'm saying?

[00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.780]
And those of you who go out and get your waterlogged newspaper this morning,

[00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.460]
you know, pick it up and throw it around a little bit. Get upset with it.

[00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.420]
Do nasty things with the hero this morning. How you doing?

[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.260]
559 at Zeta 4 on a beautiful Monday morning. What a great way to start the week.

[00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.800]
Right? Lea Gillette is here and the Mr. Bird is here. Captain Dave is in the other room.

[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.620]
Yeah, Mr. Sports. Oh, is he Captain Dave? Well, we just made him Captain Dave.

[00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.520]
Captain Dave is the old watermelon man. Is this a new nickname?

[00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.960]
You've been hiding from me all week. Didn't waste any time. The watermelon man is here.

[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.680]
And we're going to be doing it every morning, six to 10. In fact, we're doing it right now.

[00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.580]
But don't tell your neighbors about it. Now Kirk Cameron is how old today? 17.

[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.840]
Boy, oh boy. I'll tell you what they sound like. He'll sound like hell. Don't they? They sound awful.

[00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.120]
Those headfos? Yeah. Those are just awful. I would never use it.

[00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.280]
Oh boy. I would never use it. Come on. Let's get some good equipment in here, Max.

[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.980]
Get serious. Would you please? I mean, this is unbelievable. Right.

[00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.680]
You went on a minute early. I noticed. I noticed this. This is a precedent.

[00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.180]
By the way, the rumor has it. And I don't want to get anybody panicked.

[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.460]
But the rumor has it that there are a whole bunch of morning people in the market this morning that came in early.

[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.920]
Yeah. That's true. I drove down the 79th Street Cosmere. Herman and McBean were there at 430 this morning.

[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.160]
Oh, my gosh. It must have been the night there.

[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.140]
I saw what was named Herman's pickup truck. Chevy pickup out there and McBean. He doesn't have a first name, does he?

[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.920]
No, just McQueen. Just McQueen. Yeah.

[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.420]
Now this is all a coincidence that they all came in early today.

[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.720]
On another South Florida coincidence. You know, there's so many of them.

[00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.040]
Look at that. There are a couple of lines flashing already. We just barely got out of it.

[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.040]
It's not even six or five. It's 30 seconds past six on Zeta 4.

[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.980]
I want you to give a lot of time checks. Okay.

[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:47.400]
And enjoy me being here on time, by the way. Now, you know on the old show, I always came in 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes late, right?

[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.580]
We always have it back. Always fashionably late.

[00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.840]
Yeah.

[00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.700]
So that's the way it's going to be on this show. We don't want to change that.

[00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.980]
But I came in early today because...

[00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.600]
You like the way I shut off the cart part there in the middle of the herald thing?

[00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.440]
But I want to get all the screw ups out of the way in the first day. Nobody is going to pay any attention anyway.

[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.840]
No, look at that. Now, wait a minute. Is Dave already answering phones?

[00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.520]
Can you believe that? He's so efficient.

[00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.560]
That's frightening. He's already answering the phone.

[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.180]
This like he knows what he's doing.

[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.760]
Yeah.

[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.120]
I don't know. I don't know Neil about your phones over on the other side, but never answer the deadlines here.

[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.300]
Ever. Ever under any circumstance.

[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.040]
Because.

[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.480]
Oh, because it's just like, oh, la. Hey, a lot of hate.

[00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.780]
Yeah, I got my first hate call here Saturday as a matter of fact. Scott was in there and he was enjoying the call.

[00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.400]
Yeah, which got me very upset.

[00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.760]
But wait till he comes in today and finds out the story. And I'm saying...

[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.400]
What story?

[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.040]
Well, wait a while. I break it on the air.

[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.260]
Anyway, the number is going to be and you probably want to write this down on the restroom walls all around town.

[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:47.300]
550.

[00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:49.460]
940.

[00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.020]
If you got that so far, 550.

[00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.900]
940.

[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.820]
940.

[00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.760]
And that's of course because the 94.9 is easy to remember.

[00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.500]
It's easy to remember.

[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.320]
Yeah, we have our Noiman mics.

[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.660]
Boy, it's is.

[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.560]
I'll tell you one thing though.

[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.120]
They sound a lot better.

[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.660]
Your sounds better than mine.

[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.840]
Well, that's no accident.

[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.540]
Yeah, right.

[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.700]
Sure.

[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.360]
I'm serious.

[00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.700]
Your sounds a lot better than mine.

[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.860]
Yeah, but yours says Zeta.

[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.340]
I want to tell you the watermelon man.

[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.980]
His voice is so deep that even without the mic.

[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.000]
He's got a reason.

[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.600]
You don't even need a mic.

[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.420]
He doesn't even need the mic.

[00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.600]
I can just bear him up.

[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.180]
Yeah, to the point where we're getting.

[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.260]
Oh my god.

[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.800]
We're all top 40 DJs and we have no hearing.

[00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.540]
No, you have any idea what power there is here?

[00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.300]
Sitting here.

[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.200]
I can blast you guys into the next room.

[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.000]
Into the AM.

[00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.400]
Into the AM.

[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.680]
Into the AM of fate worse than death.

[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.100]
And by the way, a little later on we have a sample of the new format on AM.

[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.080]
I saw them sitting over there.

[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.340]
Did you walk in and say hi to Mike and Arlene?

[00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:51.340]
I walked in.

[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.680]
I looked at Arlene and she said.

[00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.300]
The most incredible thing.

[00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.540]
There's our first mistake.

[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.080]
Or is that the second mistake?

[00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.940]
There was no mistake.

[00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.680]
What happened?

[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.340]
She said the most incredible thing.

[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.460]
And I'm not going to do it now just because of you.

[00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:05.460]
Can you say kinky?

[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.880]

[00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.640]
Hey, listen, there's a whole new deal here.

[00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:10.240]
I know.

[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.220]
I understand.

[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.360]
What do you want?

[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.940]
Like a 20 share on the first morning?

[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.740]
No.

[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.640]
You out of your mind?

[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.780]
Why should this show over here be any different than the one we did on AM?

[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:19.500]
I'll screw it up.

[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.220]
Yeah, of course.

[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:27.100]
By the time, like by the end of the first week we'll have all of this equipment like degenerated to the level of the cramp that we used over there.

[00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.400]
Now I know that Arlene and Mike are going to do great.

[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.780]
Yeah.

[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:30.660]
And, uh, sure.

[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.120]
Why was Mike wearing black this morning, by the way?

[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.600]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.000]
I've never seen him do that before.

[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.340]
Look at Johnny Cash, didn't they?

[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.640]
604 at Zeta, the Rio Grande Show, setting new lows in the history of FM.

[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.220]
And of course, a lot of these paint-and-the-ass callers are going to say,

[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.480]
Well, where's the music?

[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.580]
Where's that music?

[00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.580]
Where's Pink Floyd in the doors, man?

[00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.560]
He's playing Pink Floyd, dude.

[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.500]
Yeah, dude.

[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.480]
You know, like we'll play a little music when we're good and ready, you know?

[00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.820]
When we feel like it, then we'll play some music.

[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.240]
One thing I will say, I'm wide awake, you know why?

[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.660]
Because I never, never fell asleep.

[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.540]
Oh, come on.

[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:10.820]
No, in the beginning, well, I must have for a little while, but in the beginning like you panic, you know, like you're afraid you're not going to wake up the first morning.

[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.100]

[00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.520]
And you keep rolling over and looking at the clock.

[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.100]
I know.

[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.680]
And it's like 130, and then it's like 10 to 1, and all of a sudden it's like 220, and you just keep looking at the clock.

[00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.280]
All of a sudden it's 430, you see, I've got to get up.

[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.520]
Yeah, so you don't think you really slept.

[00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.060]
Glenn, tell us your excuse for getting up late this morning.

[00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.700]
He was, don't, I always know.

[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.160]
He already has an excuse.

[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:30.640]
Don't push him.

[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.380]
My alarm clock dropped off.

[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:34.080]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.600]
Over night.

[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.340]
Should we take, should we take some of these calls?

[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.440]
I'm excited about taking a phone.

[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.000]
Oh, yeah.

[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.520]
Of course.

[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.280]
If I remember where the hell they come in on here.

[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.280]
It says phone.

[00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:42.000]
Phone.

[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.160]
Yeah, the phone would help, yeah.

[00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:44.380]
It's probably on this one here.

[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.740]
Try that one that says phone.

[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.100]
It doesn't say phone.

[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:47.740]
What is it?

[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.640]
How about the phone is way over here.

[00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.860]
Hey, listen, I wasn't even close.

[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.220]
If you want to play this.

[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.000]
I didn't even say that.

[00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.140]
What did you turn on?

[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.000]
Do you have any idea?

[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.640]
This is fun, don't you?

[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.140]
I didn't say it.

[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.240]
It's like playing with a new toy.

[00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.760]
Okay, now which one should we take first?

[00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:01.240]
Just like phone.

[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.860]
Look at this Captain Dave has already given us the finger like, hey, you're number one.

[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.160]
You're number one.

[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.440]
Let's get that breakfast club back on, man.

[00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:11.440]
You're number one.

[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.220]
Come on, Captain Dave, get serious.

[00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:14.440]
Okay, number two.

[00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:15.520]
Now, wait a minute.

[00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:16.200]
This is serious.

[00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.460]
Now, this is our first call.

[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:18.740]
Okay.

[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:19.840]
We'll be nice.

[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:20.340]
Okay.

[00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:21.380]
Dave County, no less.

[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.180]
Is that okay, Lee?

[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.240]
Fine, fine.

[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:23.640]
Hola.

[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:24.380]
Hello.

[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.020]
Good morning.

[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:26.860]
A voice.

[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:28.400]
It sounds like grandpa.

[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.340]
It's Al Lewis.

[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.740]
Good morning, Uncle Lee.

[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:31.840]
Good morning, Uncle Lee.

[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:32.840]
It's the island queen.

[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:33.520]
It is?

[00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:34.380]
Isn't it?

[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:35.660]
Island queen?

[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.680]
Can you say king?

[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.600]
You've been up all night waiting.

[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:41.720]
What happened to that?

[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.060]
Peter Moon.

[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.480]
I must have been like riveting.

[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.060]
You've been talking to Peter all night, huh?

[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.020]
What kind of a show do you think this is, island queen?

[00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.620]
Well, I was hoping you would pay a little CCR.

[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:53.760]
Look at CCR.

[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:54.800]
All right.

[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.980]
This is our kind of call, Rick.

[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:57.420]
You bet.

[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:57.600]
I don't know.

[00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:58.480]
Welcome you to FM.

[00:07:59.020 --> 00:07:59.600]
Thank you.

[00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:01.360]
That's it.

[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.180]
That's it.

[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.060]
Now, wait a minute.

[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:03.800]
Oh, come on.

[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.360]
Now, Jeff, I could not see that all this.

[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.200]
Now, wait a minute, island queen.

[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.920]
Now, you always used to get too nervous to talk to us on AM, right?

[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:11.760]
That's right.

[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.740]
You would call.

[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:13.780]
You'd be on the screen.

[00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.640]
And before we could get to you, it'd be too nervous.

[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.400]
This is story you went to.

[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.620]
So, I really use.

[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.360]
So, he talked to us on the air.

[00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:21.560]
And we're thrilled.

[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.800]
This is going to leave you in the aim of the radio.

[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:24.260]
Yep.

[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.760]
Well, if anybody would know island queen, you're the guy.

[00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.720]
And by the way, by the way, island queen,

[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.740]
are in into some postman the other day at a restaurant.

[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.980]
And they wanted to thank you very much for those posters you sent

[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:36.320]
to the Carol City Post Office.

[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.400]
I know they all have it on the bathroom.

[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.580]
Okay, listen, have a wonderful day in a great life, okay?

[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:44.560]
And if we don't see you soon, I'll revert there.

[00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:45.500]
You know the island queen.

[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:45.720]

[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:46.560]
No, I don't.

[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.420]
But you get familiar.

[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.900]
Isn't Carol City lovely at 4.30 in the morning?

[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:50.480]
Perfect.

[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:50.620]

[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:51.220]
I'm serious.

[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.200]
Well, can I ask you a dumb question?

[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.820]
How come the date and brown lines are a lot of.

[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.800]
And that dumb vocal line, it would pay so much money.

[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.220]
I thought that was going to be a big bonus.

[00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:59.260]
We got to make that clear.

[00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.420]
That in Bokeh, you can call toll free, same numbers.

[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:02.340]
Wisdom as well.

[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:03.100]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.200]
It's other, at least southern part of West Palm County.

[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.160]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:06.920]
Should I give the number?

[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.200]
Yeah, I don't like giving these numbers.

[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:08.820]
You know that.

[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.800]
No, just it's, yeah.

[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:11.760]
For Bokeh, people get used to it.

[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.120]
We do it once a first day.

[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:14.660]
550-

[00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:15.100]
Dash.

[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.460]
Is he pathetic or what?

[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.740]
Is he, is he tragic?

[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.020]
Well, the Bokeh line is ringing.

[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:24.940]
Are you excited?

[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:25.680]
Absolutely.

[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.500]
And I'm going to tell you what.

[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.720]
Now, let's take one from Broward, because we took one from Dave.

[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.800]
You're going to get in the rest of the number or what?

[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.880]
But now we're taking calls for this early in the morning.

[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:32.560]
It's 6.07.

[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:33.780]

[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:34.340]
Dash.

[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.000]
94.90.

[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.140]
You know, the best part of this is, what was that number again?

[00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:38.680]
5.

[00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.340]
That's a scary, isn't completely controlled.

[00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:44.600]
Oh, boy.

[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.620]
Okay, thank you, Captain Dave.

[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.120]
It says, turn up the damn phone.

[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:49.260]
Okay.

[00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:51.720]
So the phone isn't so hot, all right?

[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.260]
Boy, what a maniac.

[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.000]
He's going to be getting us all week.

[00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:55.460]
You know that.

[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:56.980]
He's going to be getting us all week long.

[00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:58.860]
And look at that.

[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.660]
He's got his Jeff Chase Voodoo doll in there.

[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.540]
The man is a maniac.

[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:02.720]
He's going out of his mind.

[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.780]
Broward County, good morning.

[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:06.520]
You be there?

[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.140]
Oh, there it is.

[00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:08.460]
Hello.

[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:09.800]
Neil.

[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:10.540]
Yes, sir.

[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:11.520]
Hello, Neil.

[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.620]
Oh, our first Broward call.

[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:14.780]
I knew it would be excellent.

[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:15.340]
How you doing?

[00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.740]
I broke the lad, you're back on the air.

[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.060]
After a long absence.

[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:20.540]
I can feel.

[00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:22.180]
Uh-huh.

[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.480]
Are you there?

[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.300]
Just barely.

[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.060]
Is the bird there?

[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:27.840]
Yes.

[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.240]
Bird, get some gas.

[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.140]
Will you bird?

[00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:31.580]

[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:32.740]
Get some heavy gas in here.

[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.480]
How about the, do they sink or do they float?

[00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:35.420]
What the, she coming on?

[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.380]
She's the first guest.

[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:37.200]
On Wednesday, yeah.

[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:38.480]
The sink and float lady.

[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:39.100]
How about your sister?

[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.140]
Do they sink or do they float?

[00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.480]
They float, not as much as, uh...

[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.600]
Ivory soap but close.

[00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:43.780]
At least.

[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.040]
Oh, well, listen, nobody's in that.

[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.360]
By the way, do you know that Lee had a big summer book, the biggest in the history of Zeta so far,

[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:51.640]
two big ones in the afternoon.

[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:52.980]
Couple of, yeah.

[00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.780]
Two huge ones in the afternoon.

[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.000]
Two hung low, right?

[00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:56.880]
Something like that.

[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:57.920]
Listen, bird.

[00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:58.560]
Yes, sir.

[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.740]
There's a lot of good people coming to the South Florida area, some entertainers.

[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:03.240]
Like?

[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.500]
Well, you missed David Brunner.

[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.280]
You could have had David Brunner on the show.

[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.120]
What would we do with them on the show?

[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.760]
Oh, look, Neil is a comedian.

[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.180]
Neil is a genius.

[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.780]
So why do we need another comedian?

[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.580]
Well, it's better than...

[00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:17.260]
Wait a minute.

[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:18.380]
We're not going to be doing that stuff.

[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.460]
Wait a minute.

[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:20.080]
Wait a minute.

[00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:20.520]
Wait a minute.

[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.780]
No, we're not going to have those comedians coming in here, are we?

[00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:23.880]
Oh, I hope not.

[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:24.200]
Oh, no.

[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.240]
Pink Floyd's going to be here another number one day.

[00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:28.580]
Look at Captain Dave.

[00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.280]
Yeah, you're going to have comedians, lots of comedians coming.

[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.140]
He's got all these people booked that we don't know about.

[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.500]
Well, we'll go and put them with Arlene and Neyne.

[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:36.420]
Strictly sabotage.

[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:37.320]
Strictly sabotage.

[00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:37.960]
Trust me.

[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.460]
I know what's going on in that other room.

[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.500]
Dave did a great job when he answered the phone.

[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:42.580]
He really is.

[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.800]
He knows his whole life is hanging on this, yes.

[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:45.940]
So could I speak to Neil?

[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.720]
He says, well, you're going to have to hold on.

[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.500]
I don't know where they're going with it this morning.

[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.320]
Yeah, really.

[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.400]
Well, we don't need it.

[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.500]
Right up to Opalaka's matter of fact.

[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.380]
And I think to the post office.

[00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.120]
Now all of a sudden it doesn't sound so bad.

[00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.080]
I think the first few minutes, like I'm getting the mong out of my system.

[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:00.460]

[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:01.940]
Learning how to use the phones.

[00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:02.820]
Seriously, Bert.

[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.380]
What do you mean learning how to use the phone?

[00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:05.360]
What's a different system?

[00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.940]
Bert, you really have to do something besides cackles.

[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.300]
Oh, come on, sir.

[00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:09.800]
Now let's.

[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.600]
I hate to get on you the first or the second call.

[00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:12.340]
No, you don't.

[00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:13.340]
Yeah, don't get on him, sir.

[00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.020]
If he covered with feathers from head to toe.

[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:16.580]
It's serious.

[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.480]
It's working well so far.

[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.780]
Let's not screw this.

[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:20.100]

[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.480]
We got a full board of calls at 6, 10 in the morning.

[00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:22.940]
Let's not.

[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.020]
You notice how I slip the time in there very cleverly, right?

[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:25.560]
I'm going to say that.

[00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:26.120]
I'm going to say that.

[00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:26.880]
I'm going to say to four.

[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:28.900]
What are you going to do on two?

[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.200]
You have to do that between every call.

[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:30.600]
I know.

[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:30.820]
Yeah.

[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:31.600]
Thanks.

[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.700]
Well, listen, it's been great, but I think you're out of material, sir.

[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:35.120]
Bye.

[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.940]
Have an oh, first was good.

[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.100]
Yeah, we said goodbye.

[00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:39.460]
First power calls are complained.

[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:40.840]
We want to thank our friends.

[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:43.600]
Are they still our friends over at the hot 105?

[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:44.580]
Oh, yeah.

[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:49.220]
Is that a first, by the way, is that the first time other call letters have been mentioned on Zeta?

[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:50.000]
Oh, no.

[00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:50.780]
Oh, no.

[00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.040]
We talk about them all day.

[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:52.680]
Do you really?

[00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:53.100]
Oh, yeah.

[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.500]
Between every other record, we'll say like another station's call letters.

[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:57.220]
I'm on the air.

[00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:57.780]
Okay.

[00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:58.580]
He got the air.

[00:12:58.700 --> 00:12:58.840]
Okay.

[00:12:59.020 --> 00:12:59.160]
She.

[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.780]
We got any good shidi's we're going to play today?

[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.240]
We're going to play heat.

[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:06.180]
We're going to play he these are the relation.

[00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.520]
Yeah, you want to put it up a little bit.

[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.800]
That's the only reason Lee is in the under show, by the way.

[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:13.840]
We wanted to put things up a little bit because on FM, you know, you can't be quite as

[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:14.580]
phased on AM.

[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:20.000]
Anyway, one of the thank Dan McKay, Marilyn La Blanc and Jim Skyler are good friends at hot 105

[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.400]
for sending over those poison bananas this morning.

[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:23.540]
Exactly what I request.

[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:27.420]
And I want to give you a little hint is who's going to be testing the first one.

[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:27.900]
Okay.

[00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.200]
Speaking of the first one, here comes.

[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.200]
Isn't that amazing how that works on the speaker phone?

[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.180]
That's when it sounds bad.

[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:37.320]
Our first Palm Beach call.

[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:37.680]
Hello.

[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:38.580]
Hello, Neil.

[00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:39.020]
Good morning.

[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.040]
I just want to know that we're awake in Boca and listening to you.

[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.900]
Well, turn over and go back to sleep, sir.

[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:44.880]
I wish I could.

[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:45.840]
I got to go to work, though.

[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.620]
We're all getting ready to go to work.

[00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.120]
All the radios are switched over back to FM again.

[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:50.760]
Great.

[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.140]
Just want to let you know we're in Boca.

[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:53.360]

[00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:55.700]
Looking forward to listening to your show on FM.

[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.980]
In fact, the bird even sounds better on FM.

[00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:59.340]
Well, now let's not go crazy.

[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.300]
Don't get carried away.

[00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:00.740]
Oh, really?

[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.780]
You may not get as many complaints on the bird now.

[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:03.980]
You've got a good voice on FM.

[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:04.660]
Well, wait a minute.

[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.200]
Let me ask you something because it's kind of a rating.

[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.300]
We got this hurricane business and all the other stuff.

[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.080]
The FM isn't crackling and popping and right.

[00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:11.740]
Oh, not at all.

[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:12.320]
Puking, right?

[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:13.660]
Real smooth, huh?

[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:14.280]
Oh, yeah, real smooth.

[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:14.880]
Great.

[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:16.340]
Pointless exciting or what?

[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:17.980]
Okay.

[00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:18.940]
Well, listen, thanks a lot.

[00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.480]
I realize you got to get to work.

[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:21.380]
Good luck to you, Neil.

[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:22.240]
Have a wonderful life.

[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.760]
Plus, he didn't have much to say anyway.

[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.500]
But, you know, the weird things they can actually hear is inside buildings on the FM, you know.

[00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:28.680]
We're going to have to get used to that.

[00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:29.200]
Like Superman.

[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:29.380]
Oh, man.

[00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:31.460]
Can I do that first?

[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:32.700]
What's that?

[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:33.540]
Oh, boy.

[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:33.880]
I'm sorry.

[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:34.720]
I should have waited a little bit.

[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.360]
I should have done that right at the top of the show.

[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:36.680]
Okay.

[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:37.700]
This sounds so good.

[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.160]
Wait till I figure out which machines are like that.

[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:41.740]
Then it's going to be a killer.

[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:42.120]
Okay.

[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:43.300]
That's going to be great.

[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:44.280]
All right.

[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:45.240]
Are you ready for this?

[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:45.700]
Yes, sir.

[00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:47.880]
Should we have like a big fanfare or something?

[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:49.540]
Now, let's just go right into it.

[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.560]
It's a good time for the great taste.

[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:53.020]

[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:57.120]
I believe I went 13 minutes without that.

[00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.200]
I am blown away.

[00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:01.780]
13 after 6 on Zeta 4.

[00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:03.300]
94 point.

[00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:04.780]
No, you're going to let him say that.

[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:05.620]
Of course.

[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.060]
Are you going to do the 99?

[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.280]
No, I don't want to do that part.

[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.700]
That's much too complicated.

[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.940]
You realize that he's already said more in 13 minutes.

[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:14.720]
And he said in the last six months.

[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:15.120]
It's incredible.

[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:16.520]
It's incredible.

[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.060]
I just sat there and I'd figure out how much I get paid per word.

[00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:20.040]
That was it.

[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:20.820]
All right.

[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.400]
So how many complaints have we had the cap of Dave on it?

[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:23.900]
No music?

[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.020]
I can't believe it.

[00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:27.900]
Okay, I think what we're going to do about six.

[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.200]
Are you trying to control yourself?

[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.220]
This is the big time.

[00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:33.420]
Now, you can't act like a jackass like on the AM.

[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:34.780]
Oh, I can't.

[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:35.200]
Okay.

[00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:36.180]
Come yourself.

[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.100]
Why am I here?

[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:37.940]
All right.

[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.900]
We are going to do something a little specialist morning,

[00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:40.740]
which we'll be repeating.

[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.700]
In fact, one thing I learned it's great about a morning show is,

[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.800]
and I learned it from good old friend of yours too.

[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.540]
You can keep repeating the same crap over and over and over again.

[00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:50.120]
You're recycling audience.

[00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:50.660]
You don't understand?

[00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:51.780]
Like six 30.

[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:52.540]
Six 30.

[00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:54.380]
All 20 of these people will be gone.

[00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.320]
We have another 20 people at six 30.

[00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:58.060]
That's true.

[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.580]
And in at six 30, we can start doing the same stuff we've done before.

[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:01.900]
I was going to make that call.

[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:02.920]
Does this line work?

[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.260]
That doesn't sound like it.

[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:06.420]
Oh, this one.

[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:07.220]
Ah!

[00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:07.800]
Oh!

[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:08.700]
It works.

[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:09.720]
Okay.

[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:15.360]
Whoops.

[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:16.320]
What do I got to do?

[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:16.740]
Dial line?

[00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:17.340]
Yeah.

[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:19.700]
Just relax, folks.

[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:20.180]
There you go.

[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:22.680]
Now?

[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.160]
These phones don't work.

[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:25.640]
I'm telling you, this is new phone system.

[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.000]
We dial a long distance?

[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:29.620]
No.

[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:30.680]
Yeah.

[00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:31.400]
We are?

[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:32.640]
Oh, you don't have to dial one.

[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:33.560]
That's right.

[00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:34.540]
You don't have to dial one.

[00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:35.060]
Just the area.

[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:35.580]
Wait a minute.

[00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:36.140]
Hold it.

[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:36.920]
Hold it.

[00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:38.700]
That's the signal for your long distance access.

[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:39.380]
Oh, boy.

[00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:40.500]
You want to put mine in?

[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:41.680]
What is it?

[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.580]
Will you dump it after I tell you?

[00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:44.840]
Will you dump it?

[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:45.920]
Please after I tell you?

[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.060]
You got to put it in now?

[00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:47.520]
Yeah.

[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:48.360]
Wait a minute.

[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.180]
Oh, listen to that.

[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.260]
You have one too.

[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:52.920]
I've told you.

[00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:53.280]
No.

[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.020]
I use Gary Lawrence's access now for long distance.

[00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:56.980]
Oh, well so do I.

[00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.420]
Okay, here it comes now.

[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:02.880]
Oh, yeah.

[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.440]
Oh, yeah.

[00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.300]
Oh, yeah.

[00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:09.140]
Oh, yeah.

[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:09.640]

[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:09.640]

[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.240]
Oh, yeah.

[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:10.640]
Oh, yeah.

[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:10.640]

[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.260]
Oh, yeah.

[00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:12.560]
Oh, yeah.

[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:12.880]
Oh, yeah.

[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:12.880]

[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:13.140]
Oh, yeah.

[00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:13.140]

[00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:14.880]
Oh, yeah.

[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:15.980]
Oh, yeah.

[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:17.620]
Can you say, kinky?

[00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:19.580]
That was 976.

[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:20.880]
Kinky, I think.

[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:23.440]
Something like that.

[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:25.360]
I'm just curious.

[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.360]
Somebody just waking up at 6.15 in the morning on a Monday morning.

[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:29.180]
What's the thing to that?

[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.620]
This is what they're into now.

[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:31.820]

[00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.020]
This could be a whole new format.

[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:33.960]
That's so loosely.

[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.180]
Save that number, okay?

[00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:35.480]
Yeah.

[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:36.160]
Save it for me.

[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.560]
What I like best about some of these machines.

[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:39.440]
The lights light up.

[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.400]
Some of them don't light up.

[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:41.440]
It's like kind of like pot luck.

[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:41.940]
Exactly.

[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:43.020]
That's the idea.

[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:46.180]
Okay, now you're going to be doing in about four minutes and 20 seconds.

[00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:47.560]
It's going to keep everything very tight.

[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:47.860]
Man.

[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:49.440]
Or, you know, a little after that.

[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.340]
And update on Floyd.

[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:51.560]
And update on Floyd.

[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:52.720]
Is that pink Floyd or what?

[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:53.720]
It's hurricane Floyd.

[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.260]
It sounds like a real wimpy hurricane.

[00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:55.880]
Doesn't it?

[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.760]
I mean, what do you think of when you think of the name Floyd?

[00:17:58.960 --> 00:17:59.660]
Floyd the barber.

[00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.620]
In Andy Gryffer.

[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:02.520]
Yeah, of course.

[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:03.040]
Me too.

[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.260]
Not as bad as a West Coast.

[00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.940]
They have where they have hurricane Ramon.

[00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:06.740]
Ramon.

[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:10.060]
It should have been reversed, I think.

[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.260]
I think we should have had Ramon and uh, uh, whatever.

[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.140]
Floyd sounds something the Midwest might get hit with.

[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:15.740]
Yeah.

[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.660]
But there's no reason to panic.

[00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:18.320]
Like in Iowa.

[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.500]
No reason to panic.

[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:20.900]
As you start picking on Iowa.

[00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:21.940]
Oh, don't start with that, Neal.

[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:22.480]
Great idea.

[00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:25.700]
Now, you know, I was born and raised in Florida and my parents, you still...

[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:26.040]
Do we care?

[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.320]
Well, my point is that my parents, you should always tell me about the...

[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:33.200]
When these storms came up and it's something for you to remember if you're not from here,

[00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:35.000]
they're only wind and rain.

[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.400]
There's no reason to panic is my point.

[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:39.860]
We're just going to have a rainy, windy day.

[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:42.720]
I feel a bit about it already.

[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:43.060]
Go ahead.

[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:43.600]
Run around.

[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.720]
It's a voice of reason here.

[00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:46.420]
The ladies and gentlemen.

[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:47.380]
Everything's fine.

[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:48.800]
Yeah, everything's okay.

[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:49.480]
Everything's okay.

[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.460]
Just relax.

[00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:53.500]
Okay, let's call up Neal Frank and see if we can get everybody panicked for that.

[00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:54.580]
Just a joke.

[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:55.340]
He's in Houston.

[00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:56.180]
He's doing great.

[00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.020]
No problem.

[00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:57.800]
Okay.

[00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.160]
We got all these calls sitting here.

[00:18:59.220 --> 00:18:59.760]
I feel guilty.

[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:00.540]
Should we take another one?

[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:01.620]
Cap and Dave?

[00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:02.640]
Don't be a guilty.

[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:03.300]
Okay.

[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:04.320]
Dave County, good morning.

[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:04.900]
Welcome.

[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.380]
Welcome to Zeta 94.9.

[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:08.560]
Yes.

[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:09.120]
Three, two.

[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:10.280]
How you doing?

[00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:11.040]
All right, King.

[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:11.440]
Complain.

[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:12.620]
Number one.

[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:13.400]
Speak up, sir.

[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.380]
The reason why I called was to tell you that...

[00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:20.080]
On my radio, I couldn't be sure that I had the right station.

[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.340]
I heard Donald and his good buddy over there.

[00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:26.440]
But I wasn't positive until I heard CCR.

[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:27.480]
Then I knew I had to...

[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.500]
Yeah, that did it.

[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:31.160]
We do that, so you make sure you're tuning in.

[00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:34.220]
If you get up like a quarter to six in the morning, you're tuning in the right station.

[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.540]
You play a couple of doors, cuts.

[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:36.220]
Absolutely.

[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:36.540]

[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.320]
Well, it's, you know, certain stations have their radio check.

[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.520]
Well, this is the first way of having a radio check.

[00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:43.060]
Exactly.

[00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:43.680]
Great.

[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:47.040]
I enjoyed it, and I think whoever was on before you...

[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.520]
What are you doing up so early in the morning, sir?

[00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.720]
What kind of a maniac gets up into the shower in the morning?

[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.120]
Well, you really wanted to...

[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:52.720]
Please.

[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:58.180]
Well, diabetic, so you got to get that little extra cut in there, you know.

[00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:00.660]
Make sure that the level's up there right.

[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:02.920]
And then you go back to sleep.

[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:03.380]
Yeah.

[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.400]
I'm going to cut you.

[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:05.960]
Yeah.

[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.420]
That's security guards.

[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.120]
That's well, that's true.

[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.340]
And it's good to hear you on FM.

[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.380]
Isn't it? Isn't it the truth?

[00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:13.580]

[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.860]
Even the bird sounds a little better out there.

[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.620]
A little better, yeah.

[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:18.820]
A little better.

[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.080]
The nerd sounds a little better, yeah.

[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.660]
You notice he qualified that, yeah.

[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.620]
Well, I don't want him to get a slow and a half.

[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:24.580]
Now you're right, sir.

[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:25.360]
You're absolutely...

[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.160]
This is a family radio check.

[00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:26.740]
Absolutely.

[00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:27.800]
Let's not talk about that too much.

[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.840]
Okay, well listen, I have a wonderful day.

[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.100]
You're in a great life, and if we don't talk to you again...

[00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:35.420]
Well, you know this is a good way that you're going to give a lot of people a new life.

[00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:36.120]
I think so.

[00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:36.800]
Really?

[00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:37.520]
Okay.

[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:38.120]
Take care.

[00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:38.840]
I'll read the urge.

[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.360]
Okay, is it that time we played the other one, but it's...

[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:43.200]
No, not for you yet.

[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:43.820]
You got to have it yet.

[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:44.900]
It's 690, Ritza.

[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:47.800]
But I think it's long overdue.

[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.900]
And the best part of this is it's scratchy.

[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:52.840]
This is very scratchy because it's so old.

[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:55.320]
Okay, you don't know what it is yet.

[00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:56.120]
Have no idea.

[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:56.880]
You like it.

[00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:57.520]
You can't wait.

[00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:58.600]
Are you ready?

[00:20:58.800 --> 00:20:59.520]
I love the quality.

[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:00.040]
You're right.

[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:01.400]
Is everybody ready?

[00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:03.480]
This might germ out of bed this morning.

[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:04.320]
I think it will.

[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:05.740]
The beginning is special.

[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:07.860]
By the way, if Peter Bulger's listing you're a wonderful guy.

[00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:09.820]
And the music you don't want to get to it.

[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:10.620]
We'll get to it.

[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:10.800]
I know.

[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:13.920]
Don't worry.

[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:16.540]
Don't worry.

[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:17.760]
Don't worry.

[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.120]
My heart.

[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.060]
Don't worry.

[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:21.500]
My heart.

[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:21.500]

[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:22.040]
My heart.

[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:22.040]

[00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:22.180]

[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.040]
Don't worry.

[00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:26.680]
Okay, not too much.

[00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:28.080]
Don't want to overdo it right to the beginning.

[00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:29.940]
But was that good or what?

[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:30.440]

[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:31.020]

[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:31.520]
In stereo.

[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:32.180]
Yeah.

[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.600]
Well, like I said, you have to partner on FM.

[00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.380]
We understand scratchy.

[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:37.860]
Because it's so old.

[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:38.200]
Right.

[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:39.480]
It's like a collector's item.

[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:40.040]
Like what was it?

[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:41.800]
WWJ and KDKA.

[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:42.220]
Mm-hmm.

[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.920]
Were the first stations on here by 1920?

[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:46.760]
And this was right on the heels of that.

[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.620]
Okay, here comes your big test.

[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:50.660]
Don't start going into a laughing jack now.

[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:50.940]
Okay.

[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.240]
Because this is your big moment.

[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:52.640]
Okay.

[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:53.800]
That we've been waiting for.

[00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:55.640]
Ladies and gentlemen, here he is.

[00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:59.840]
Got his wings all plucked up this morning now.

[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.040]
20 past six on Zeta 4.

[00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.260]
This is the Neorodger show.

[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:08.080]
This is your brain.

[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.040]
Any questions?

[00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:18.780]
Boy, that sounds like a real newscast and everything with the intro.

[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:19.460]
I love it.

[00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:22.060]
Well, if you get to the news, maybe it'll still be going.

[00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:23.440]
621 on Zeta 4.

[00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:25.280]
I'm Glenn Hill on the Neorodger show.

[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:27.640]
The main thing we'll be talking about today in the news,

[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:31.160]
of course, is about Floyd as it nears Hurricane Force.

[00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:34.240]
And we have Hurricane Warnings in effect for the Florida Keys

[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:37.440]
from Key Largo through the dry tortillas

[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.800]
and for the Southwest Coast of Florida,

[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.980]
South of Venice, that does not include Sarasota.

[00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:46.640]
But a Hurricane Watch now in effect from Venice to Tarpen Springs

[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:50.300]
and a tropical storm watch in effect for the Florida East Coast

[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:53.320]
from Key Largo to Jupiter, England and a tropical storm watch

[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:57.120]
also in effect for Bimini and the Grand Bahama Islands in the Bahamas.

[00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.460]
Also, a tornado watch, National Weather Service is issued,

[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.960]
a tornado watch for most of Central and Southern Florida.

[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:08.840]
This includes us and this is from 7 this morning until 4

[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:12.680]
Monday afternoon, tornadoes, large hail, dangerous lightning,

[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.080]
damaging thunderstorm winds all possible in our area.

[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.760]
Now, the watch area is along in 75 miles east and west of the line,

[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:24.060]
west of Orlando, to 45 miles southwest of Miami.

[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.060]
And of course, as I keep telling you,

[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:31.820]
don't panic, a tornado watch just means now in the oil that conditions are favorable.

[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:37.020]
In other words, it's just possible.

[00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:38.520]
I don't want you running around.

[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:45.100]
Here's where the storm is 24.0 north and 83.5 light huts,

[00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:49.440]
about 120 miles west, southwest of Key West,

[00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:52.100]
or about 200 miles southwest of Fort Myers.

[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:58.300]
That's 24.0 north, 83.5 west and it's moving towards the northeast

[00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:03.100]
at 15 miles an hour, expected to turn more north eastward.

[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:07.100]
And this should bring the center along the lower west coast of Florida,

[00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:08.840]
probably this afternoon.

[00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:11.860]
The highest winds have now increased to 70 miles an hour,

[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:16.640]
and winds of 40 miles an hour extend about 125 miles north of the center.

[00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:21.140]
Key West reported gusts to tropical storm force in the past hour.

[00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:24.140]
Floyd could become a hurricane anytime this morning,

[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.700]
and you should just be prepared for this possibility.

[00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:28.600]
Why are you building like to a crescendo?

[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.100]
Yeah, I'm going to say a moment ago, don't panic.

[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:31.220]
Don't worry.

[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.100]
Everybody stay calm.

[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:34.060]
And it's like he's building.

[00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:37.480]
If you don't decide, yeah, it's just wind and rain.

[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:38.820]
It's just another storm, right?

[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:39.820]
Just relax.

[00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:41.460]
Tell us about the big hail.

[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:42.220]
How big, Glenn?

[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.300]
We talking canned ham's here or what?

[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.240]
Died three to five feet above normal.

[00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:47.920]
Only three to five feet above normal.

[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.420]
Like watermelon size hay.

[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:50.300]
Nothing even.

[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:52.620]
All right, next advisory.

[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:53.260]
Look at that.

[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.320]
I just caught Captain Dave Yawning in the other...

[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:56.960]
I saw that.

[00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:57.840]
I saw it.

[00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:00.620]
Okay, we're making little marks on all of these moves.

[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:03.340]
All right, so this is what we're mainly going to concentrate on.

[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:04.080]
Anything else?

[00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:08.300]
Just the weather forecast, tropical storm, watch in effect,

[00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:11.420]
and we're expecting cloudy and rain today and tonight.

[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.800]
Winds are possible up to 30 miles an hour in South Florida,

[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.240]
and we'll keep you advised on any further developments

[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:19.080]
or anything that happens with that.

[00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:20.740]
I have no idea what the temperature is.

[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.260]
You want to just get one up about 175.

[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:25.640]
Around 75.

[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:26.420]

[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:29.360]
On Zeta 4, 94.9, it's 624.

[00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:30.560]
I'm Glenn Hill.

[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:34.060]
Past six at Zeta 4, boy, almost did it.

[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:35.340]
I knew what was going on.

[00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:35.720]
Sorry.

[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:36.120]
Sorry.

[00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:36.780]

[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.680]
I almost said on she.

[00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:41.300]
Just a joke, okay?

[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.440]
It's just a little joke.

[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.380]
Mr. Sports will be along at 635,

[00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:47.080]
and he's got some real depressing news.

[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:48.040]
All the scab scores.

[00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:49.040]
Oh yeah.

[00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:50.860]
For all your scamblers out there in the audience.

[00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:51.920]
Did the dofs win?

[00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:53.080]
Yeah, the one.

[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:53.300]

[00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:54.340]
No, not the dofs.

[00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:56.600]
The scammed doffins, one 42 to zip.

[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:56.980]
Good.

[00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.300]
25,000 people I was over at Calder.

[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:00.500]
I broke my streak yesterday.

[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:01.320]
Had a winning day?

[00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:02.120]
No, you did.

[00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:03.940]
Went to Pompidol last night, gave some of it back.

[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:04.960]
I like to spread it around.

[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:05.740]
You know, like manure.

[00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:08.020]
I spread it all over Dayton, Broward County.

[00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:09.560]
So did you break 10 bucks?

[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:10.700]
Oh, it was all over?

[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:11.120]
Barely.

[00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:12.240]
Just not too much more.

[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.900]
Okay, we're going to play the George Harrison.

[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:14.960]
Now, the interesting part of it,

[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.460]
you know, I feel guilty about these people on phone.

[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:17.600]

[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.380]
You're going to play a record?

[00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:19.440]
We're going to play our record.

[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.740]
Now, don't panic because we're not going to play a lot of music.

[00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.700]
But we know on his first morning,

[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:25.980]
a lot of those pinnities, bureaucrats, are listed.

[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:26.940]
What was the music?

[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:30.660]
Man, he made a play, paint Floyd me.

[00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:32.780]
The one I was, paint Floyd is coming up later.

[00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:35.260]
Much later, like sign one of Derrick's Island show.

[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.840]
But we are going to play the, this record is so good.

[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:38.680]
I'm obsessed.

[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:39.220]
Yeah.

[00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:40.400]
Can I admit that that I'm obsessed?

[00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:41.500]
Oh, boy.

[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:44.180]
Something else you're obsessed with, okay?

[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.140]
Well, you thought it was the electric light orchestra first,

[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:47.320]
because it sounds like you're just...

[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:47.380]
Well, it sounds like you're just...

[00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:48.160]
...produced by Jeff Lyd.

[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:48.580]
Right.

[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:49.520]
You have any idea what the title is?

[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:50.460]
So I'm going to play a little bit of my music.

[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.600]
No, I have no idea.

[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:52.140]
No, I don't either.

[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.360]
Do we know what the title is?

[00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:54.760]
What is it?

[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.900]
He doesn't know what it is, but it's great.

[00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:57.900]

[00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:57.980]

[00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:58.520]
He's been playing.

[00:26:58.520 --> 00:26:58.520]

[00:26:58.520 --> 00:26:59.880]
The guy's had a lot of pressure in there.

[00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:01.800]
Does it matter what the title is?

[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.160]
There comes this sign, isn't it?

[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.440]
Yeah, something like that.

[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:04.880]

[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:07.820]
Okay, I think we're going to play it.

[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.940]
But I want to, you know, we're going to build into it.

[00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:11.720]
Like it about 640, we'll probably play it.

[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.560]
I just want to get, even with him, you know.

[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:16.240]
He's been giving us little hand signs like this.

[00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:18.260]
And I want to keep waking up a little bit, okay?

[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:21.120]
Okay, George Harrison, I'm saying it, and I promise you,

[00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.560]
we're not going to overdo this, okay?

[00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:23.880]
I'm going to noise over there.

[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:24.760]
Russell the paper over.

[00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:25.860]
Excellent.

[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:27.840]
What are you doing?

[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:30.200]
Getting your next newscast together out of the newspaper?

[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:31.420]
Out of this coloring book.

[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:33.500]
A slow newsday, Glengest weather.

[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:34.140]
That was it.

[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.720]
That's it. That's all that's going on.

[00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:36.560]
Welcome to Florida.

[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:37.220]
Yeah.

[00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:38.500]
Do you like Florida?

[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:39.580]
You're a flyer.

[00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:40.080]
So far.

[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:40.840]
The Neil Rogers.

[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.920]
Tell him that I've never heard of smuddy or program in my life.

[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.220]
Okay, thank you so much.

[00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:47.780]
A little tissue buff greeting from our friend Rabbi Sam.

[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.040]
Took it.

[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.600]
We're going to have services, by the way, on a show.

[00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:52.780]
We are.

[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:56.040]
It's going to be the only morning show in town on FM with religious services.

[00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:58.040]
Every morning, we're going to convert.

[00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.500]
I think we ought to take a call, don't you?

[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:00.120]
Yeah.

[00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:01.400]
People have been waiting like a lifetime.

[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.500]
Dave County, are you there?

[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:04.200]
Yeah.

[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.340]
I can't believe it.

[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:06.620]
You must not work, right?

[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:07.600]
Yeah.

[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:08.660]
You're one?

[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.160]
Hello.

[00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:10.780]
Hello.

[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.160]
Sir, speak to me, sir.

[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:13.680]
Wake up.

[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:14.960]
I'm kind of nervous.

[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.100]
I never called this guy.

[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.280]
But nevertheless.

[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:20.000]
Is this Joey Reynolds?

[00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:20.760]
Yeah.

[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:23.200]
What a shot, sir.

[00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:24.360]
What a shot.

[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.100]
Just for that.

[00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.060]
A little memorial to here.

[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:28.300]
Okay, for this caller.

[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:29.500]
Only for you, sir.

[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:31.800]
Let me see.

[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:32.480]
I'm a little nervous.

[00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:34.220]
I never called them already.

[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:35.380]
They're new in the right.

[00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:36.800]
Okay, and he hung up during that.

[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:37.700]
Well, you only want a nerd?

[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:38.640]
He'd be ill in the middle.

[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:38.640]

[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:38.640]

[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:38.640]

[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:38.640]

[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:38.640]

[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.440]
He'd be real ill in this morning.

[00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:43.020]
Obviously.

[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:43.940]
Oh.

[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:45.440]
Broward, you say what?

[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:49.040]
Joey.

[00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:50.960]
What just be funny?

[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:51.880]
That's it.

[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:53.080]
That's a good call.

[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.640]
Now I see why you went to these calls.

[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.840]
Well, we want to get him out of the way, you know what I'm saying?

[00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:57.140]
Yeah.

[00:28:58.180 --> 00:28:59.620]
Should we take that other bokeh call?

[00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:00.860]
I'd say this much, boy.

[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:01.400]
They're flashing.

[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.340]
You're intrigued by a bokeh line.

[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.500]
It just amazes you that we have that.

[00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:05.860]
Yeah.

[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:06.740]
Boca.

[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:07.920]
Yeah, good morning, you know.

[00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:09.140]
Are you really in bokeh?

[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:09.740]
Yeah, I really am.

[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:10.860]
This is Terry up in bokeh.

[00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:11.880]
Hey, well, nothing's perfect.

[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.100]
Terry, just remember that.

[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.120]
This just goes to prove I need a life.

[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:19.000]
I've just spent 20 minutes on hold before dawn.

[00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:20.460]
Jesus.

[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:22.040]
What is that teller?

[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.540]
I beg your pardon?

[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.000]
Len has never sounded like that.

[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:25.740]
Oh, my gosh.

[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.880]
You also said dry corticas.

[00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:28.960]
Yeah, tortillas.

[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:29.440]
I got that.

[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.080]
Those are delicious, I think.

[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:32.480]
For a Florida.

[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.540]
There's one right under your banana over there, by the way.

[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:35.040]
Yeah, really.

[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:37.280]
Listen, I think that the storm is all just talk.

[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:39.980]
I think the other strations are trying to divert attention from you this morning.

[00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:43.060]
Yeah, is that Gary Owen's in the studio with you guys?

[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.220]
Yes, he's got his hand over his rear right now.

[00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:45.820]
Good morning.

[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.860]
Really, I got up at 5 o'clock to adjust all my radios.

[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.760]
And it just, like I said, it just goes to prove I really need a life.

[00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:52.380]
Yeah.

[00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:53.840]
Are you going to get one this week?

[00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:55.200]
I certainly hope so.

[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.060]
You guys sound great on the FM.

[00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:02.360]
Legion led makes dancing like a tender of my god.

[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.400]
You got something caught in a stroke?

[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:06.460]
Well, we don't want to get into that.

[00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:08.740]
Okay, I had to call earlier.

[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:09.960]
I started.

[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:13.680]
Okay, have a wonderful day, sir, and a great life.

[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:14.000]
Thank you.

[00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:14.800]
I'll read the urge.

[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.100]
Should we do the sports like I've been in early, Mr. Sports?

[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.220]
Do you think he could get into it?

[00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:18.860]
Sure.

[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:19.760]
No, we're right.

[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:20.560]
Maybe 35.

[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.620]
We're right at 35 on Zeta 4.

[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:24.840]
It looks like 634 on Zeta 4 to me.

[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:26.660]
Mr. Time expert.

[00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:27.900]
He's rubber clocking again.

[00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:28.300]
Yeah.

[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.420]
Getting those quarter hours in, aren't you, Glenn?

[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:32.480]
There you go.

[00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:36.700]
Okay, listen, this guy is going to really be a big addition to the show.

[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:37.240]
Trust me.

[00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:37.520]
Okay.

[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:37.920]
Does it matter yet?

[00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:38.360]
No.

[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:39.480]
See a little guy in a booth?

[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:40.040]
Mm-hmm.

[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:40.920]
You look very carefully.

[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:43.560]
Good morning, everybody.

[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.240]

Union leader, Gene Upshaws, has management with DRAWL.

[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:23.460]
That's with DRAWL from the bargaining table was orchestrated to tax the solidarity of striking

[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.060]
players and freeing scant fans out there.

[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:27.180]

It's a beautiful day for a communist.

[00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:21.400]
Unless you're on the KGB list, you will do time in a salt mine.

[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.740]
You will do slave labor.

[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:25.880]
Hello, boys and girls.

[00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:27.800]
This is Mr. Rogers.

[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.400]
Welcome to my neighborhood scheme.

[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:35.180]
Oh, I bet that's my Russian postman, called Red McFailey.

[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:36.780]
Hey, coming.

[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.360]
You know, he's kind of a funny postman.

[00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:39.980]
Sure.

[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:43.960]
Not only does he deliver my name, he likes to open it too.

[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:46.320]
I guess he's just kind of curious.

[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:47.180]
Sure.

[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.040]

[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:53.980]
But why?

[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.660]
Can you say crimes against state?

[00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:57.800]
I think so.

[00:32:57.960 --> 00:32:59.600]
Can you say CIA spy?

[00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:00.540]
Oh, sure.

Okay.

[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:20.660]

[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:23.420]
Neil Rogers with you on a Monday morning with lead July Glen Hill,

[00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:27.260]
Captain Dave, Mr. Sports, said a bunch of other would be human beings.

[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:28.500]
I liked Mr. Sports.

[00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:29.100]
Did you like it?

[00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:29.880]
I think he's going to be great.

[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:30.460]
He was your type.

[00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:31.540]
No question about that.

[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:33.960]
He was your type.

[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:36.240]
Now, we're not going to have the weather fairy is at the deal.

[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:37.480]
He didn't make the cut or more.

[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:38.320]
You'll be here later in the week.

[00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:38.800]
Okay.

[00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:42.000]
Well, let's see.

[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:42.800]

[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:43.940]
We were very close.

[00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:44.460]
We were very close.

[00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:46.460]
We were kind of psychic temperature.

[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:49.080]
78 degrees on Zeta 4.

[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:50.640]
What time is it, Glen?

[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:51.720]
Do I do another time check?

[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:53.460]
94.

[00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:56.560]
Maybe we can just keep giving the time all morning.

[00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:57.160]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:58.440]
The hell with his other stuff.

[00:33:59.160 --> 00:33:59.440]
Okay.

[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.700]
That vocal line is, by the way, not flashing again.

[00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:03.500]
We're going to have to condition those people.

[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.140]
And you know me, I get very insecure.

[00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:06.740]
Very insecure.

[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:08.160]
Make it clear it's toll free.

[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:09.180]
550.

[00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:10.200]
Oh, yeah, that'll do it.

[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:12.500]
There's just one guy that uses it all the time.

[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:13.360]
That's it.

[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:13.680]
Yeah.

[00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:14.280]
Is he a chronic?

[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.460]
No, we got another guy coming over from the AM now.

[00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:16.740]
Yeah.

[00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:17.340]
Don't worry.

[00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:17.980]
You know who I mean?

[00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:18.520]
Yeah.

[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:19.380]
Couple of them.

[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.640]
It's a matter of a chronic.

[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:21.100]
Yes.

[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:22.160]
And don't worry.

[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:23.640]
We will use that line.

[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:24.680]
I mean, 550.

[00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:25.180]

[00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:25.620]
90.

[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:26.380]
90.

[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:30.120]
Let's get Larry Kendan here to do trade line.

[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:31.460]
Great idea.

[00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:36.340]
Please remind me as a morning wanes on to get into this thing

[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:36.820]
from the Sun.

[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:37.300]
Oh, wow.

[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:39.100]
Was this on Saturday?

[00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:39.500]
Saturday.

[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:40.060]
Disgusting.

[00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:40.940]
I'm going to get plenty of time.

[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:41.860]
Yeah, I want to wait till a bill.

[00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:43.280]
Make sure Bill Kelly is awake.

[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.740]
Well, since he's a new big guy.

[00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:46.940]
Anybody out there knows Bill Kelly, call him and home and wake him up.

[00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:47.280]
Good idea.

[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:48.860]
You're going to have to because he's a new big guy.

[00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:52.680]
Because we're going to rip him a rear, the likes of which seldom has been seen since the

[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:53.700]
Oprah Winfrey show.

[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:53.920]

[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:58.680]
I mean, it is going to be, even our lean Ross is going to be embarrassed.

[00:34:58.860 --> 00:34:59.420]
Why the way?

[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:00.420]
Where do we have that thing?

[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:04.920]
We have somewhere a little clip, which I'm going to play a little later on from this morning's

[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:09.680]
news on WINC AM, our sister in law station up in the other end of the building.

[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.180]
It is incredible.

[00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:13.000]
Okay, let's take some more calls.

[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.080]
I mean, we know one here already.

[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:16.860]
You'd argue we've been here a lifetime, right?

[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.860]
It almost sounds like we know what we're doing.

[00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.100]
Line three says Captain Dave.

[00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:24.720]
Captain Dave is just finally waking up now.

[00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:26.200]
You notice he's finally getting into it.

[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:29.180]
He's washing his hands in his face and putting him under our armor.

[00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:30.920]
I would trust him.

[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:32.160]
Would you?

[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:32.500]
Yeah.

[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:35.720]
Well, that's because you worked at that place together for years.

[00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:37.440]
We worked at another radio station together.

[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:38.740]
Broward County, how you doing?

[00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:39.800]
Yeah, dude.

[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:40.860]
Hey, dude.

[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:42.260]
How you doing, dude?

[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:43.080]
That's a big fight.

[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:45.400]
Holy cow, this guy says.

[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:47.200]
What the hell happened in?

[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:48.840]
Wow, wow.

[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:50.760]
Just, it's early in the morning, you know what I'm saying?

[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.220]
Like, don't get too carried away.

[00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:54.340]
He's been up all night.

[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.300]
Hey, oh, man.

[00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:58.580]
Are you the guy that's been on hold since Saturday?

[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.760]
So you could talk to me since Friday.

[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:01.860]
Friday, about two o'clock.

[00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:04.200]
They tell, oh, league, congratulations.

[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:05.840]
Congratulations, Lee.

[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.600]
You're okay with league power on numbers.

[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:08.980]
I know it's two big ones.

[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:10.760]
Hey.

[00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:11.440]
Yes?

[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:12.940]
Speak to us, sir.

[00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:13.240]
Come on.

[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:13.460]
Come here.

[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:13.820]

[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:15.200]
No music.

[00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:15.660]
No music?

[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:17.760]
You mean you didn't like George Harrison?

[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.240]
Yeah, this is my boyfriend's back.

[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:21.760]
Oh, well, no.

[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:22.320]
That's coming up.

[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:22.620]
Yeah.

[00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:23.660]
That's coming up next hour.

[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:24.660]
Not a bad suggestion.

[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:25.400]
All right, dude.

[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:26.060]
I gotta get to work.

[00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:26.700]
I'm late already.

[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:27.720]
Okay, good luck to you.

[00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:28.240]
All right, bye.

[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:29.180]
Okay, that's what we like.

[00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:30.920]
Callers who are willing to be late to work too.

[00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:32.980]
Wait on the phone for a half an hour to talk to us.

[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.200]
Yeah, but it's a matter of priority.

[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:35.920]
Of course.

[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:37.060]
Come on.

[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.100]
Get your priority straight.

[00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:38.580]
What are these?

[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.060]
This, this, this I gotta go to work, bit, you know.

[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:42.580]
But this is good.

[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:43.980]
They'll get off quicker, you know.

[00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:45.020]
Calls would be short.

[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:46.860]
How come that vocal line's not ringing?

[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:48.860]
It's nobody awake up there.

[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:50.560]
We're gonna have one like in Jupiter, you know.

[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.380]
For all the good people are Palm Beach Garden.

[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:52.880]
I agree.

[00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:53.340]

[00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:53.740]
I agree.

[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:53.800]

[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.540]
I'm gonna install this coffee pot from as Jupiter.

[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.560]
If, uh, wait a minute, if they call from West Palm,

[00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:01.540]
do they get through like magically on it?

[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:04.620]
Because somebody said the other day that these lines are like all over the place.

[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.180]
Yeah, we used to have a West Palm line.

[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.160]
What happened to that?

[00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:09.220]
I have no idea that it's the new phone system.

[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:10.560]
Yeah, West Palm line.

[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:11.620]
It's not the new phone system.

[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:14.260]
It was the Zeta deficit that they had to pull that line up.

[00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:14.660]
I see.

[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:16.080]
Because it did used to go to Jupiter.

[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:19.240]
That's why they're making this desperate move to bring us over here,

[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:20.100]
according to Bill Kelly.

[00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:20.700]
Desperate.

[00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:21.740]
Desperate.

[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:27.100]
Okay, let's give some chance for him to get coherent and wake up before you rip him down.

[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:27.600]
Polka's lit.

[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:28.420]
Should we take Boka?

[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:29.240]
Of course.

[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:31.560]
You other people get very upset because we take him out of order,

[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.100]
but, uh, to hell with them, huh?

[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:34.320]
Boka, how you doing?

[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:34.860]
Good.

[00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:35.860]
Are you in Boka?

[00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:36.340]
Yeah.

[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:37.300]
See, I told you.

[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:38.920]
What's up?

[00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:40.740]
Speak to us.

[00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:41.920]
What?

[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:43.160]
What?

[00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:44.200]
Who is this?

[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:45.000]
Boka.

[00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:46.020]
Did we wake you up?

[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:46.520]
No.

[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:47.100]
Okay.

[00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:48.040]
Go away to school.

[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:50.500]
You realize you're our first female caller?

[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:51.640]
Wow.

[00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:52.820]
Wow.

[00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:53.540]

[00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:56.740]
How is lead Gillette's voice gotten to you so far, man?

[00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.040]
I don't know.

[00:37:58.380 --> 00:37:59.180]
How old are you, dear?

[00:37:59.240 --> 00:37:59.720]
Unimpressed.

[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:01.100]
How old?

[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:02.440]
16.

[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:03.040]
16.

[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:03.820]
Unimpressed.

[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:04.480]
Yeah.

[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:05.940]
How about my voice?

[00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:07.220]
I don't know.

[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:07.660]
Yeah.

[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.100]
Not gonna be out of place.

[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:12.180]
Is there anything that stimulates you, man?

[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:12.960]
No.

[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:13.580]
Okay.

[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:14.280]
Good.

[00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:16.340]
And you're in Boka, right?

[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:16.640]
Yep.

[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:17.120]
Perfect.

[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:17.260]
Great.

[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:17.580]
Actually.

[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:21.560]
Okay, well, it should have a wonderful day and you're gonna be here every morning with us?

[00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:21.780]
Yep.

[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:22.620]
Look at the point.

[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:25.340]
Okay, this is like I said, a great caller from Boka.

[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:25.980]
Thanks a lot.

[00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:27.280]
Okay, bye-bye.

[00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:28.320]
What a good caller.

[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:29.300]
Interesting demographics.

[00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:29.960]
Yeah.

[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:30.740]
16.

[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:31.500]
Brightening.

[00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:32.500]

[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:34.960]
War.

[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:36.040]
That is...

[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.160]
We cannot corrupt our youth now, you know?

[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:38.680]
I'm not on the show.

[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:39.280]
No, no.

[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:40.040]
No way.

[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:40.900]
Can you say kinky?

[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:41.560]
Okay.

[00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:46.620]
Let's go back to, uh, two.

[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:48.720]
Okay, Captain Dave, anything you say, man?

[00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:49.920]
Dave Cowdy, hello.

[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:50.800]
Hill.

[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:51.620]
Yes, sir.

[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:52.160]
Good morning.

[00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:56.340]
This is great, these, uh, you know, being out in the morning now, I can just call them when I get put on hold.

[00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:58.220]
I can just go to sleep with the fun against my air.

[00:38:58.420 --> 00:38:58.840]
Very good.

[00:38:58.940 --> 00:38:59.360]
Good idea.

[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:00.680]
Or wherever, you know.

[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:00.920]
Yeah.

[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:02.840]
Somebody else is pretty upset this morning, I...

[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:03.180]
Who's that?

[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:07.620]
I didn't get the full number this morning, so I accidentally dialed 559-4-FM.

[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:11.540]
And I asked for a nail and they weren't so much better than this.

[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:11.940]
Really?

[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:14.420]
Yeah, but, you know, I guess that's their own problem, right?

[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:15.760]
Did Donald call you, Madam?

[00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:18.380]
No, he called Donald, man.

[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:19.000]
Oh, okay.

[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:20.920]
At least somebody had it right.

[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:26.260]
You know, um, I think he should be pretty, uh, pretty impressed, this is your first Kendall call.

[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:27.280]
Wow.

[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:28.200]
Wow.

[00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:30.980]
How's the weather in Kendall this morning?

[00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:33.380]
Oh, it's, uh, pretty sunny and it's about to...

[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:36.920]
Is this Captain Kendall?

[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:37.760]
Right, yeah.

[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.100]
I know that voice anywhere.

[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:44.400]
Yeah, well, I want to say also that, uh, out here in Kendall, we are able to take advantage of...

[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:47.420]
You know, you've been on this early in the morning while it's still dark outside.

[00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:52.520]
We're over here right now with the Bird's apartment, and we're ransacking it.

[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:54.180]
Very nice, actually.

[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:58.060]
But I tell you, these droppings and the newspaper all over the floor is very unpleasant.

[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:00.060]
Yeah, Miami-Herald all over the floor.

[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.200]
Just leave the VCR, sir.

[00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:05.260]
Anything else I really am not interested in?

[00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:06.500]
You know what the best part of this show is?

[00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:07.300]
And the cuddle bone.

[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:08.080]
Leave the cuddle bone.

[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:11.420]
You know what the best part of the show is so far, we have had nobody upset over the...

[00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:12.620]
Where is the music, you know?

[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:12.800]
I know.

[00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:14.500]
Not one complaint, nobody.

[00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:16.800]
Excuse me, I've got a question for you guys.

[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:17.540]
What's a question?

[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:18.500]
Where is the music?

[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:26.040]
Well, you don't have a good time, it's great listening to you on FM and take care.

[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:27.220]
Okay, you too, sir.

[00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:27.820]
Bye-bye.

[00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:28.720]
I'll read the darch.

[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:30.480]
Okay, no, real smart-ass here.

[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:36.540]
It's 16-D-4-7 at Zeta-4, and uh, before you're going to be doing the weather again in six minutes, huh?

[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:37.080]
I'm ready.

[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:38.240]
I'm ready and ready.

[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:41.300]
We got the temperature now, and what time is it, Glenn?

[00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:44.040]
I got a couple of other stories here, don't worry.

[00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:46.080]
I was wondering if we're going to milk that all week long.

[00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:47.780]
No, no, no, it's about a quarter of seven.

[00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:49.680]
We don't want to get too exact here, right?

[00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:51.200]
It's around a quarter of seven.

[00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:51.500]

[00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:55.380]
Like they do on FM, you know, somewhere between 630 and 7, you know.

[00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:59.500]
Hey, if you're late for work and get that second cup of coffee.

[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:00.240]
Okay.

[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:01.340]
Okay.

[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:02.800]
I think of that, Lee.

[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:04.760]
You're going to have to bear with us.

[00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:07.220]
This is our first day here, but hey.

[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:10.760]
All listen to you.

[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:12.340]
Remember, I told you in the summer they listened.

[00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:13.640]
Oh, yeah, how old is your son?

[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:14.280]
14.

[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:15.240]
Oh, really?

[00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:16.660]
Wow, that's not interesting.

[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:21.300]
That's a very good deal.

[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:21.980]
I know.

[00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:25.460]
Well, listen, I'll get your number off the ear, and we'll have a little tea party tonight.

[00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:26.140]
Oh, wonderful.

[00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:27.220]
Just you and me.

[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:28.700]
So glad you're here in the morning.

[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:30.620]
Well, you sound really, are you really in Boca?

[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:31.860]
I am really in Boca.

[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:33.020]
That's West Boca.

[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:35.080]
Doesn't she sound like she's right in the room all alone?

[00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:36.100]
I know, I know.

[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:38.360]
Sounds better than my mic, doesn't it?

[00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:38.980]
A lot better.

[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:39.840]
Your mic is on.

[00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:41.240]
No, it's these cans.

[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:42.420]
You can't hear anything.

[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:43.000]
Not even hear it.

[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.360]
Oh my, oh, my.

[00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:45.440]
Oh, my.

[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:47.460]
Oh, my.

[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:47.660]

[00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:50.500]
They really...

[00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:52.300]
I know how to whip these people to shape my face.

[00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:54.280]
I can't believe they did.

[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:55.480]
I can't believe they gave me...

[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:56.000]
Hello, Neal.

[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.680]
And they still too old men, sector me here.

[00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:58.540]
Are they still too loud?

[00:41:59.040 --> 00:41:59.200]
No.

[00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:01.320]
Because I'll turn them down and then up again real quick.

[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:02.160]
Yes, I'm sorry.

[00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:03.860]
So, it's wonderful.

[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:05.000]
I love you in the morning.

[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.900]
Leigh just lost three pits out of his watermelon.

[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:08.500]
Go ahead, man.

[00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:11.540]
No, just happy that you're here in the morning.

[00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:13.260]
I thought I was going to have a nervous breakdown

[00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:15.260]
when you went off that other station.

[00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:16.320]
But now I see them not.

[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:20.100]
See, one of the advantages to this is that until at least about 8.15 or 8.30,

[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:22.800]
all of the pain in the ass bureaucrats aren't here yet.

[00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:23.820]
That's true.

[00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:25.860]
You come in early in the morning, get most of the show out of the way.

[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.300]
And then, you know, they come in, they get organized, get their coffee,

[00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:30.880]
goof around, have a couple of free bagels and stuff like that.

[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:33.020]
And by the time they're finished with that, we're gone.

[00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:33.900]
We're out of here.

[00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:35.140]
Speaking of bagels.

[00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:35.960]
You're going to bring your breakfast.

[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:38.220]
Yeah, that's how you're just going to be food alone.

[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:38.380]
No food alone.

[00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:39.040]
All right, come on.

[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:39.740]
No, wait a minute.

[00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:41.460]
That's not me, isn't that what we were told?

[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:42.880]
No, that's a next two.

[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.880]
You find a contract that said no food is allowed.

[00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:47.500]
No, as a matter of fact, I haven't signed any contract yet.

[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:49.640]
So, what I'm going to, I guess I'll hold that as a bargaining chip.

[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:50.120]
Yeah.

[00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:53.280]
Well, have a super day.

[00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:55.880]
And by the way, if you're listening, Gary, today is D-Day, okay?

[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:57.160]
I want to put any pressure on you.

[00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:59.620]
But, you know, let's see that contract with those big number.

[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:02.400]
Okay, listen, have a great day.

[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:03.160]
What's your son's name?

[00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:06.000]
No, he's listening.

[00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:07.320]
Just the first name.

[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:08.680]
All right, listen to E.

[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:09.980]
You too.

[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:10.720]
Eric.

[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:11.660]
You got it.

[00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:12.420]
See, I know.

[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:13.120]
I know.

[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:15.380]
Okay, listen, you know, tell Eric have a wonderful life.

[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:15.860]
I will.

[00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:16.660]
Thank you, me also.

[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:17.080]
Bye-bye.

[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:19.180]
Okay, boy, she was nervous, wasn't she?

[00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:20.140]
Well, with reason.

[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:20.620]
Why?

[00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:25.920]
By the way, I must confess, when I'm wrong, I'm wrong, okay?

[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:27.220]
Very simple.

[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:30.680]
I saw the preview for Stand By Me.

[00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:31.800]
The preview, right?

[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:33.140]
You know the one that goes on for like, you know what I mean?

[00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:36.040]
Like, 10 minutes, a filler, like a nishio.

[00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:38.140]
And I was wrong.

[00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:40.760]
Okay, yeah.

[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:42.200]
About River Phoenix.

[00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:45.200]
What about him?

[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:47.020]
Well, I was wrong.

[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:48.940]
How about a little clue?

[00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:54.000]
Okay.

[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:54.980]
Just a little kid.

[00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:55.740]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:57.240]
He's just a little kid.

[00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:59.060]
But you still haven't seen the entire movie.

[00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:01.980]
No, but they have this thing where they're interviewing the two kids who are like the stars.

[00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:02.720]
Who's the other one?

[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:06.160]
Well, we, boy, she's like, no, this is so straight.

[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:08.580]
He's like a walking encyclopedia of useless crap.

[00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:09.000]
Yeah.

[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:10.640]
A head full of useless crap.

[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:10.980]
Yeah.

[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:13.020]
A body full of useless crap.

[00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:14.260]
Perfect, yeah, 5 news, man.

[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:17.680]
But I guess that's like a current interview.

[00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:19.680]
You know, they're talking in retrospect about the movie.

[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:20.140]
Right.

[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:22.620]
And now, of course, they're no longer little puny kids.

[00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:24.460]
They're like, a little older puny kids.

[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:25.440]
Like, 16 now.

[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:29.660]
And trust me, I can understand why some of our more desperate people in the audience are all upset.

[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:31.700]
Now, if you've seen that movie, please stand by me.

[00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:34.060]
I saw the first time we got a last Saturday night.

[00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:35.780]
We were talking about this the other day.

[00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:35.960]
Yeah.

[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:36.920]
I liked it.

[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.520]
Did you hear that?

[00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:39.620]
He liked it.

[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:40.860]
Neil still hasn't had fun.

[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:41.320]
I just went on.

[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:41.840]
I can't hear it.

[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:42.280]
That right.

[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:44.160]
Neil has not seen the entire movie.

[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:47.340]
He's judging this movie by seeing like the last hour of the movie.

[00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:48.520]
How are we going to go through this again?

[00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:49.400]
Just briefly.

[00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:52.540]
I mean, every day do we have to do stand by me.

[00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:54.100]
Every single day.

[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:58.240]
Is that part of our revolutionary format here instead of reviewing a different movie every day?

[00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:00.880]
We're going to review the same movie every day.

[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:01.880]
By the way, Don Stutter.

[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:04.120]
I'm so glad you mentioned movie reviews.

[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:04.880]
Don Stutter.

[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:06.700]
Did you hear any of you yesterday?

[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:07.740]
About 20 minutes.

[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:09.520]
About 20 minutes.

[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:11.120]
Interesting.

[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:14.300]
Maybe 25.

[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:17.680]
You talk about putting the AM in a freezer.

[00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:18.300]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:19.080]
The deep freeze.

[00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:22.860]
I mean, that man, he could do more damage in four hours than most of us can do in a lifetime.

[00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:27.440]
What I was just listening to him, he was pushing his own advertising agency.

[00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:30.440]
No, he was pushing buttons when I was trying to get the cart machines to work.

[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:33.020]
And you know the one that we queue up the carts in that sits on top.

[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:35.140]
He was trying to play that on the...

[00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:40.960]
And it was great.

[00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:41.480]
It was...

[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:42.120]
What a show, Don.

[00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:42.380]
I'm telling you.

[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:44.520]
I thought, did you just hold the earphones up to the mic?

[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:45.340]
I think so.

[00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:45.420]

[00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:47.500]
I will say this.

[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:50.420]
His performance on the ear is only outdone by his movie reviews.

[00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:53.700]
Did you see a soul man with P-Town's mouth?

[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:54.920]
The fact I did watch part of that.

[00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:56.760]
It is the last hour.

[00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:58.680]
And I didn't like the last hour of that either.

[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:00.000]
It is coming on my cable.

[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.620]
I saw the ad for it.

[00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:02.920]
It's coming on HBO movie.

[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:04.340]
It will be on HBO very soon.

[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:04.800]
Classic.

[00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:05.960]
I will get to see it.

[00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:07.100]
You don't have to tape it for me.

[00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:09.740]
It's about the kid that goes to Harvard and with the shoe polish.

[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:10.780]
He'd be black, yeah.

[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:12.980]
P-Town's Hall.

[00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:14.880]
Or it's the Thomas Hall.

[00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:15.780]
Or one of those letters.

[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:16.620]
He'd be chilling.

[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:17.740]
D-Town's Hall.

[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:18.200]
Something.

[00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:18.800]
Cute movie.

[00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:20.260]
You going to give the time now?

[00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:22.460]
713.

[00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:23.540]
We got it right now.

[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:23.980]
We've got it right now.

[00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:24.860]
Absolutely on the button.

[00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:26.620]
I just got the power of the morning.

[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:27.620]
Something special.

[00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:30.620]
This isn't one of those comedians from the...

[00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:33.500]
Oh, no more comedians on this show.

[00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:35.400]
They haven't got the word up front.

[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:36.600]
A little note here.

[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:38.540]
I bet you this is from Joey.

[00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:39.120]
You want to bet?

[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:40.220]
I bet it is too.

[00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:40.660]
Or...

[00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:40.720]
Or...

[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:40.920]
Or...

[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:41.520]
Or...

[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:41.660]
Or...

[00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:41.660]

[00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:41.660]

[00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:41.720]
Or...

[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:41.740]
Or...

[00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:41.740]

[00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:41.960]
Or...

[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:41.960]

[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:42.000]
Or...

[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:42.000]

[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:42.000]

[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:42.000]

[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:42.700]
Or...

[00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:43.460]
Or...

[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:56.600]
Or...

[00:46:58.700 --> 00:46:59.180]
Or...

[00:46:59.180 --> 00:46:59.180]

[00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:00.240]
B-Hallo, I know this is not legit.

[00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:01.080]
You telling me!

[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:01.720]
Who's it from?

[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:04.300]
It's says Marvin Bailey in town.

[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:04.760]
Oh...

[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:05.120]
Oh god.

[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:06.820]
Marvin, not Marlon.

[00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:08.100]
Marvin...

[00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:10.480]
Marvin, Bailey in town, air scout created by Pat Art, you

[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:14.240]
Das Melmak, iyi, Die Beat, Veron External.

[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:14.460]
Kofi Zeifying.

[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:26.560]
Rangers NHK Crisis Correct

[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:26.560]

[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:30.220]
from your good friend Marlin Bailey. Marvin Bailey.

[00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:33.900]
Marvin Bailey. You know, thank you very much.

[00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:36.140]
Don't call us. We'll call you.

[00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:37.180]
When do that's really from?

[00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:39.960]
Well, when he came in there like that, that was kind of freaky wasn't it?

[00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:41.500]
No, right when we were talking about Jeff Stryker.

[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:44.040]
It depends on the coincidence or...

[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:45.320]
I'll put a lock on that door.

[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:47.960]
I know. Anyway, just about to explain the lead.

[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:50.080]
Oh!

[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:51.600]
Oh!

[00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:54.640]
It sounds like a programming meeting.

[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.980]
You know something? I bet you we could just...

[00:47:56.980 --> 00:48:00.620]
I bet you we could just play this all morning for four hours.

[00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:02.300]
Do a couple of news breaks, little weather.

[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:03.100]
And get a three.

[00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:03.400]
Three.

[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:05.620]
Get a five with this.

[00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:09.760]
It sounds so much better in stereo.

[00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:10.560]
Yeah.

[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:13.840]
And we could play Stans Frogs, you know, sort of alternate.

[00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:15.460]
Okay, thanks Jeff.

[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:20.360]
And periodically we're going to be calling Jeff on a West Coast, which is good because when we come on,

[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:23.460]
it's six in the morning, Eastern time, three in the California time.

[00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:25.180]
And they're just getting in. They're all getting in at that.

[00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:25.700]
Perfect.

[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:26.360]
It'll be great.

[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:26.780]
Yeah.

[00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:28.500]
Absolutely.

[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:31.880]
Glenn, you still haven't told me about your fetishes.

[00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:32.840]
He becaates.

[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:34.220]
He becaates. I know about that.

[00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:34.520]
Yeah.

[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:35.720]
That's my fetish.

[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:37.200]
Sure. Big Don Ho fan.

[00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:37.900]
That's about it.

[00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:39.940]
Big Don Ho fan.

[00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:41.020]
Oh!

[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:43.020]
Have all this compact disc.

[00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:45.860]
Just what we needed, right?

[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:50.020]
Now, Conjure's supposed to be here to butcher up the image in the show and always pull in the stand major.

[00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:50.560]
I know.

[00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:53.540]
Now, Conjure up in your mind, a Don Ho CD.

[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:54.580]
I've got him.

[00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:55.440]
I'm serious.

[00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:57.100]
I will bring the men.

[00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:00.380]
Okay.

[00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:01.360]
I need bubbles.

[00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:06.100]
We've got an incredible live version of Little Shack by the sea.

[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:07.840]
Not a cheap life jackalore too much.

[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:10.120]
A whole life urge to be going dano.

[00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:10.400]
Yeah.

[00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:11.340]
Number one.

[00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:12.640]
That's the tip off.

[00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:16.980]
And what's the story on his hair, by the way, in that series that lock a curly,

[00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:21.020]
lock he had over his forehead, jackalore, whatever's in his solution statement.

[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:21.520]

[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:21.660]
Yeah.

[00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:23.900]
He bought those at the Awakeake Deli.

[00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:24.280]
Okay.

[00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:26.140]
So now, Neil's fetish is chef striker.

[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:26.860]
Mine is fake.

[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:28.680]
No, no, I don't have any Jeff striker fetish.

[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:30.160]
I don't need, I never even met the guy.

[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:33.800]
Boy, do you wish he comes down here alive.

[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:34.140]
Wrong.

[00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:36.360]
Not interested in the least bit of each other.

[00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:40.480]
Other, other, a gigantic grotesque, disgusting,

[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:41.780]
vulgar thing.

[00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:42.800]
Go ahead.

[00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:43.600]
Thing.

[00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:45.200]
Thing.

[00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:46.400]
We're on FM.

[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:47.860]
We can be a little more open about this.

[00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:49.020]
Can we open on FM?

[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:50.140]
And we get more explicit.

[00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:54.100]
I heard that a lot of the jocks on FM are real open, but we'll save that for tomorrow morning.

[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:55.120]
Okay.

[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:57.280]
There we go.

[00:49:57.380 --> 00:49:59.260]
Thanks a lot, pal, with a champagne agreement.

[00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:00.400]
Is there a champagne in there too?

[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:01.240]
I would imagine, right?

[00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:01.580]
Yeah.

[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:02.400]
Cat me on.

[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:03.020]
We want that.

[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:03.540]
I'm sure.

[00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:04.640]
Cat me on.

[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:06.100]
But it's that sauce about 830.

[00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:07.080]
He gets going real good.

[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:09.540]
That's from working at gloves 94.

[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:10.600]
That's right.

[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:13.260]
All those gloves rejects, man.

[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:14.960]
They hit the sauce about 830 in the morning.

[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:15.300]
True.

[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:17.080]
Now and a half before sunny starts.

[00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:19.460]
Speaking of sunny, did we have,

[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:21.500]
did we have a big message from sunny this morning?

[00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:22.300]
Did we?

[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:23.480]
I don't think so.

[00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:23.920]
I'm assuming.

[00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:27.800]
You're going to go, you're going to go, you're going to go.

[00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:31.060]
Get a banana here.

[00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:32.200]
Okay.

[00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:35.300]
Sonny's going to be along with the Mongolian news a little later,

[00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:36.880]
but it's at time again.

[00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:37.620]
Can you believe it?

[00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:39.760]
It seems like, I know it's 820.

[00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:40.660]
Before you know it.

[00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:41.140]
I know.

[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:42.800]
Before you know it, this message is going to be over.

[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:44.020]
Not you must admit that

[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:46.200]
two hours and 20 minutes.

[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:48.360]
You've got, you've had a chance to say more today

[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:49.480]
than you have in the last year.

[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:50.500]
This is incredible.

[00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:51.940]
It is, I mean truly.

[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:53.000]
And that's all he keeps saying.

[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:54.540]
This is a just horrible thing.

[00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:55.360]
This is incredible.

[00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:56.840]
So emotionally blown away.

[00:50:57.600 --> 00:50:58.400]
I'm exhausted.

[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:00.220]
This is so early in the morning.

[00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:00.540]
All right.

[00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:02.400]
Now listen, I know that you've taken a lot of excitement

[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:03.740]
and this was pretty good here when

[00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:05.120]
Marvin Bailey sent this stuff.

[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:06.800]
And if when Don Ho comes in,

[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:09.720]
you are just going to freak out.

[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:14.060]
It's 820 on Zay...

[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:15.720]
Hey young man.

[00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:18.160]
Listen, I've seen you hanging around my house

[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:19.860]
and I have some I want to talk to you about.

[00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:20.680]
What is it Mr. Bailey?

[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:21.260]
I wasn't here now.

[00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:22.340]
I'm going to put it this way.

[00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:22.640]
Yeah.

[00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:24.760]
Wasn't you, who did the pushin?

[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:27.000]
Put the stains upon the cushion.

[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:29.880]
Put prints on the dashboard upside down.

[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:30.800]
Hey.

[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:31.040]
Hey what?

[00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:32.340]
Who wasn't you?

[00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:35.620]
You Braco Bill been messing with my daughter Jill.

[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:38.460]
If it was, you'd better leave this town.

[00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:39.660]
Well, you got to say.

[00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:42.420]
Yes, to us, I who did the pushin,

[00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:44.520]
put the stains upon the cushion,

[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:47.480]
put prints on the dashboard upside down.

[00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:47.760]
Yeah.

[00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:48.280]
Yeah.

[00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:51.040]
But since I'm messing with your daughter,

[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:53.260]
I have a trouble passing water.

[00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:55.820]
So I guess we're even all around.

[00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:56.880]
Why you wait?

[00:51:57.060 --> 00:51:57.620]
Come over here.

[00:51:57.940 --> 00:51:58.420]
Come over here.

[00:51:58.540 --> 00:51:59.040]
Come over here.

[00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:01.380]
Love that spot, Glen.

[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:03.560]
It's 848 on Zayda 4,

[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:05.200]
the New Roger Show on a Monday morning.

[00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:07.400]
And just now, you know, when the show is over today,

[00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:08.740]
we're just really going to be getting in with.

[00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:09.600]
We are.

[00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:11.500]
So maybe Gunsor could stay home for a while.

[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:12.700]
No chance.

[00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:13.500]
No.

[00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.340]
Don't even think about it.

[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:16.560]
Gunsor's already here.

[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:17.560]
He's been here for an hour.

[00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:18.060]
Is he really?

[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:18.380]

[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:19.200]
Thank you, paranoid,

[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:21.300]
because he easily didn't get here to about like, you know,

[00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:22.240]
I just don't know.

[00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:23.420]
No, he's getting into it now.

[00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:24.080]
Don't you understand?

[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:24.500]
Okay.

[00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:26.200]
Just wanted a clarification on that.

[00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:28.380]
Because this show is not temporary.

[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:30.160]
No, it is not.

[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:31.620]
By the way, if you haven't got the word,

[00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:33.200]
this show is not temporary.

[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:34.040]
Listen, on the Breakfast Club,

[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:35.820]
we ought to do this a little retrospective

[00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:37.600]
on those three and a half weeks.

[00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:39.140]
Lovely, we used.

[00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:40.680]
In retrospect, it was only temporary,

[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.040]
but it was beautiful.

[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:42.500]
Oh, yeah.

[00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:43.520]
Yeah, I'm right.

[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:44.600]
But the retro is effective.

[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:46.180]
The retro is effective.

[00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:48.020]
They did just the flood of memory.

[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:48.640]
Emotional.

[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:49.600]
I just remember.

[00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:50.720]
It was into my head.

[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:51.200]
It's blown away.

[00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:52.480]
I couldn't believe it.

[00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:55.200]
Gosh, boy, talk about bringing back memories.

[00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:57.320]
Now, Cap and Dave was the Alihar Viyaz

[00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:57.920]
wall of radio.

[00:52:58.100 --> 00:52:58.740]
It was right now.

[00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:00.660]
Unbelievable.

[00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:02.260]
And the Linda Thornton commission,

[00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:03.940]
it's going to investigate that.

[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:04.460]
What happened?

[00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:04.940]
Okay.

[00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:06.360]
Well, listen, we're going to take some more calls

[00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:08.460]
and in Boca, if you want to get on the line,

[00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:08.940]
that's fine.

[00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:10.140]
And if not, you know,

[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:12.180]
stick it is the best thing we can say to you.

[00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:15.240]
550, 9490.

[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:16.600]
I'm embarrassed by giving that number.

[00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:18.400]
Even a moron could remember that number.

[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:20.320]
And speaking of that, Peter Boulder is in a building.

[00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:23.700]
Just a joke, Peter, just a joke.

[00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:24.340]
He loves it.

[00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:25.080]
He's used to it.

[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:26.040]
He loves the attention.

[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:27.620]
And I thought he was going to come in for a minute.

[00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:28.720]
Oh, he's no dummy.

[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:29.800]
Really?

[00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:31.040]
I thought he was going to come in.

[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:31.740]
Have a little, uh,

[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:32.360]
no way.

[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:32.600]

[00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:32.980]
No way.

[00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:33.260]
So okay.

[00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:33.800]
No way.

[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:36.000]
But we will give that number for Boca,

[00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:37.100]
which is a little bit different.

[00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:38.360]
It's 550.

[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:40.260]
Dash.

[00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:41.580]
940.

[00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:42.620]
90.

[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:44.420]
Yeah, they have a dash in the Boca right?

[00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:44.740]
I see.

[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:45.980]
And every time I do that,

[00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:47.240]
that damn Boca line rings,

[00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:48.780]
that's what really pisses me off.

[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:49.500]
You don't sit there.

[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:50.140]
They're there.

[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:50.660]
They're there.

[00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:51.200]
I'm serious.

[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:53.060]
Well, they just want to bug you.

[00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:55.200]
And then once it gets on hold,

[00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:57.220]
I become so curious and to pour people in

[00:53:57.220 --> 00:53:57.920]
Dayton Broward,

[00:53:58.020 --> 00:53:58.540]
they just get left.

[00:53:58.700 --> 00:53:59.680]
I'm not going to do that to him.

[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:00.740]
Because who's waiting?

[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:01.580]
In Dayton Broward?

[00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:03.540]
One, two.

[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:05.840]
Whatever you say, Cap and Dave.

[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:07.360]
Dave Cowdy, good morning.

[00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:07.940]
Good morning.

[00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:08.980]
Welcome to Zeta.

[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:09.560]
Thank you.

[00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:12.800]
Welcome you to the airways and this on the FM.

[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.060]
Thank you so much.

[00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:16.420]
Now, I'm wondering if we have an

[00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:18.200]
home income in here with Floyd coming

[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:19.560]
three weeks before Pink Floyd.

[00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:20.660]
Yeah, I think there's a

[00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:22.200]
definite connection at now.

[00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:23.600]
Yeah, it's not just part of our new

[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:24.700]
promotional campaign.

[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:27.040]
I figure we knock out all the wind and rain now.

[00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:28.200]
That way we have a clear concert.

[00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:31.100]
Tony Prado has been hanging around with Weaver the weatherman

[00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:33.260]
and boy, are they whipping up something wild?

[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:33.820]
I'll tell you.

[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:36.500]
It sounds like it.

[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:36.840]
Yeah.

[00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:38.700]
Well,

[00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:40.140]
that was great.

[00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:41.880]
Good thought there.

[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:44.020]
You go to the Pink Floyd concert?

[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:45.480]
Yeah, 42nd row.

[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:46.840]
Have you ever been to Pink Floyd now?

[00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:48.120]
Oh, sure.

[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:49.520]
Don't go to the show.

[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:51.520]
It's more fun just to hang out in the parking lot.

[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:53.280]
After the show, I'm sure.

[00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:53.340]

[00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:55.200]
I watch people try and find their cars.

[00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:55.740]
True.

[00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:57.000]
Very true.

[00:54:57.420 --> 00:54:58.140]
Very true.

[00:54:58.320 --> 00:54:58.880]
I don't know.

[00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:00.540]
I ain't got parking homestead.

[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:01.860]
I'm not sure.

[00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:02.960]
I know.

[00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:03.540]
Oh, wait a minute.

[00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:03.980]
Then we pay,

[00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:05.920]
we pay a Pink Floyd record just before we get to the box.

[00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:06.780]
Yeah, briefly.

[00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:06.900]
Briefly.

[00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:08.360]
Yeah, that one.

[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:08.640]
Yeah.

[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:09.220]
Playing part of it.

[00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:10.740]
We're not playing Pink Floyd today.

[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:11.120]
Tomorrow.

[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:13.340]
And we're not playing any money today either.

[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:13.680]
Okay.

[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:14.740]
I'm sorry.

[00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:15.880]
That's good.

[00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:16.440]
Yeah.

[00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:17.000]
Yeah.

[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:17.660]
Too early.

[00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:19.180]
Too early for early models.

[00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:20.300]
You hear all that stuff later.

[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:22.000]
It's too early in the week for any money.

[00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:24.400]
Tomorrow, we're doing our doors montage for about an hour

[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:25.320]
and get it out of our system.

[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:26.080]
That's how good.

[00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:28.300]
We don't want to get the regular Zeta listeners.

[00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:29.980]
All the sir coming up.

[00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:30.360]
Yeah.

[00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:31.140]
Later in the week.

[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:31.840]
Chicago record.

[00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:32.260]
Do we?

[00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:32.900]
I'm a man.

[00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:34.320]
Decided we hated yesterday.

[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:35.160]
El Paso.

[00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:36.540]
Yeah.

[00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:37.040]
El Paso.

[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:38.380]
Let me ask you this question.

[00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:39.480]
Do you like Chicago sir?

[00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:41.760]
Um, not the city of the group.

[00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:42.720]
No, not the city of the group.

[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:43.700]
They have the city of the group.

[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:44.000]

[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:44.280]
Okay.

[00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:46.340]
You remember a record called I'm a man?

[00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:48.140]
Not really.

[00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:48.400]
See?

[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:49.160]
There you go.

[00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:49.740]
I don't either.

[00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:50.700]
I never heard that record.

[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:51.200]
Yeah.

[00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:53.120]
And these people hold cult records.

[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:56.300]
It's one of those great AOR, EOR, you know.

[00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:57.100]
Now I'm a man.

[00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:57.800]
I never heard of it.

[00:55:57.960 --> 00:55:58.840]
Spencer Davis group.

[00:55:58.900 --> 00:55:59.320]
No, right?

[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:00.180]
That's I'm a man.

[00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:01.780]
I mean, that's what you're talking about.

[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:02.380]
That's what I'm saying.

[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:02.820]
Yeah.

[00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:06.280]
Oh, was it Janet Jackson?

[00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:07.100]
I've heard of it yesterday.

[00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:09.060]
Nobody understood.

[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:11.520]
Breathing in my, breathing in my llama's ear.

[00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:13.580]
And whisper sweet nothing.

[00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:19.040]
Tito, put a mask on the lawnmower.

[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:23.280]
Tito working at the post office again.

[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:23.600]
Yeah.

[00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:23.940]
There he is.

[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:24.700]
Really is.

[00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:25.820]
Look, it's raining again.

[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:26.880]
It's pouring.

[00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:27.200]
Yeah.

[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:28.100]
That's in dogs, sir.

[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:30.680]
Wait, it's clear and it's clear and gentle.

[00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:32.240]
Uh, go out and get in the traffic.

[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:34.320]
I feel like I'm trapped in the.

[00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:37.300]
I'm waiting for a truck traffic in the rain.

[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:38.500]
Go play in some traffic.

[00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:39.320]
It sounds great.

[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:40.760]
Well, listen, have a wonderful day.

[00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:43.520]
It's been really illuminating listening to you.

[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:46.620]
And if you go outside, be sure to put on your ass best

[00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:47.440]
those collages.

[00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:49.280]
I'm saying best those shoes.

[00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:50.000]
Okay.

[00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:50.580]
Okay.

[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:51.460]
I'll read the urge.

[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:52.960]
That was another call from Kendall.

[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:54.940]
Boy, we're in big and kind of Kendall.

[00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:55.080]
Yeah.

[00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:56.500]
Kendall, the station is giant.

[00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:57.500]
A monster in Kendall.

[00:56:57.580 --> 00:56:59.340]
Well, what's great is they can hear you in Kendall

[00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:00.700]
down that you're on a family.

[00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:01.460]
Like Frankenstein.

[00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:02.540]
Wait me.

[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:04.080]
They can hear us in Kendall kidding.

[00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:05.060]
Inside you.

[00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:07.940]
We got a lot more response from Boka on the AM.

[00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:08.440]
Okay.

[00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:09.300]
That's true.

[00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:09.780]
Yeah.

[00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:12.540]
We did get called collect and they really got into that.

[00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:14.060]
You know, they don't have to call collect.

[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:15.200]
They can call for free.

[00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:17.900]
Oh, so other words, what you're saying is they called only

[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:20.000]
because they wanted to make us pay for it.

[00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:20.460]
That's right.

[00:57:20.900 --> 00:57:23.120]
And we just make your life miserable.

[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:25.880]
No, we love spending the company's money.

[00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:27.120]
One of the favorites.

[00:57:27.540 --> 00:57:27.840]
Okay.

[00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:29.120]
Let's try Broward.

[00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:30.100]
Hello.

[00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:30.780]
Hi.

[00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:31.640]
How you doing?

[00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:32.540]

[00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:33.380]
Thank you.

[00:57:33.540 --> 00:57:36.420]
And I just want you to know that this morning,

[00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:40.100]
Joey had been asking listeners to pledge quarter hours.

[00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:43.300]
Now he's asking other radio personalities to pledge their quarter.

[00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:46.820]
Oh, boy.

[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:48.320]
He doesn't have too many left to give away.

[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:48.880]
I'll tell you that.

[00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:49.540]
That's true.

[00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:54.560]
And you guys want the school lunch menu for Broward County today?

[00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:55.260]
Absolutely.

[00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:58.540]
Well, we got fish burgers or hoagie sandwiches.

[00:57:58.980 --> 00:57:59.300]
Oh.

[00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:01.680]
Juice, french fries, and a cookie.

[00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:03.480]
Kids go with the hoagie.

[00:58:03.620 --> 00:58:06.920]
That sounds like a good time for the great days.

[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:07.260]
Yeah.

[00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:10.600]
We have a little actuality somebody called in from Palmetto Jr.

[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:13.340]
high from Friday during lunch break.

[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:17.380]
So fish sandwiches, I'm telling you.

[00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:24.460]
These kids get up this morning and his vocabulary lessons.

[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:27.140]
I want you to know that I have a seven year old daughter

[00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:28.740]
who's listening this morning.

[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:31.060]
And she wanted to know what the word douchebag means.

[00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:34.360]
Do I call her that she should refer to stand major?

[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:40.140]
If she opens up her webster and looks under the word stand picture,

[00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:41.940]
that will be right next door.

[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:45.420]
Now, best of this is supposed to be cancer-quizing agent.

[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:47.960]
It's really comforting to know that they're using those

[00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:50.540]
asbestos boots to make huge pizzas.

[00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:51.520]
Yeah, you got it.

[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:52.000]
It's true.

[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.080]
And we, listen, from what I understand,

[00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:59.440]
when I bring my car in for a car wash at your place,

[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:01.980]
they're, I want to make sure that you vacuum the back seats.

[00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:03.040]
No, prom it on.

[00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:04.860]
And we'll do the trunk if you'd like as well.

[00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:05.900]
That's five bucks extra.

[00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:08.740]
I'm watching the baseball playoffs this week.

[00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:12.520]
And we got a guy named Sparky and a guy named Whitey.

[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:13.980]
And I want to know where Wally is.

[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:15.500]
She's Wally?

[00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:17.800]
The Wally's at Metzger's field.

[00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:20.100]
Okay, the beef will be along in about a half an hour.

[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:21.840]
But they're messing around right now.

[00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:22.840]
I think she's in Boka.

[00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:25.240]
Instead of the bird doing the news,

[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:27.440]
don't you think the bird's eye view should be in the traffic?

[00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:29.240]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:31.740]
He has no idea which way the bullman looks along.

[00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:33.480]
He looks a lot like clearance too.

[00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:36.620]
I think I saw him on Elton Road last week in the beaches.

[00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:37.540]
I have a nice life.

[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:38.400]
You too, sir.

[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:39.260]
I have it there.

[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:40.640]
J-35 on Zeta.

[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:43.480]
You'll never guess who's back in spite of popular demand.

[00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:44.040]
Good morning, everybody.

[00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:45.420]
Two teams that haven't been in the league

[00:59:45.420 --> 00:59:47.280]
since the 1960s hold the upper hand.

[00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:47.620]
We room.

[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:48.680]
Two teams that haven't been in the league

[00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:51.180]
since the 1960s hold the upper hand in the league playoffs

[00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:51.720]
in baseball.

[00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:54.120]
Minnesota twins thanks to Darrell Evans in F play.

[00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:56.260]
It made the American League championship series three games.

[00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:56.700]
They're exciting.

[00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:57.200]
Probably.

[00:59:57.480 --> 01:00:01.140]
Maybe it's the weather furry to report on Floyd.

[01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:03.920]
Okay, speaking of reporting, it's at time again.

[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.140]
And in the morning, we have a heavy turnover.

[01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:08.160]
But for those of us who have to listen each hour

[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:10.120]
over and over again, please, you know,

[01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:10.800]
what are you talking about?

[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:11.980]
Mix it up just a little bit.

[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:12.960]
Less on news time.

[01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:14.440]
Variety is the spice of life.

[01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:14.960]
News time.

[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:15.180]
News time.

[01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:15.500]
News time.

[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:16.180]
That's just 50.

[01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:17.380]
I was going to give it to you now.

[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:19.140]
Because I figured if I give it to you now

[01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:20.600]
by 10 of you'd be talking about something.

[01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:22.520]
I just, well, I saw this channel.

[01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:24.740]
10 is here and I immediately thought of news, right?

[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:26.640]
And I thought of Anne, who almost hit me

[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:28.800]
with a diesel truck on Saturday coming to work.

[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:34.360]
And she did, boy, she was barreling by me like Dennis Weaver.

[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:35.460]
Remember in that movie, Duel?

[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:35.800]
Duel.

[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.660]
Or he was trying to get away from the lunatic

[01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:38.180]
and the truck.

[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:39.860]
Anne had that mean look on her face.

[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:40.800]
I'm going to get you.

[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:41.440]
You maniac.

[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:43.100]
Well, fix you.

[01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:44.700]
All right.

[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.740]
And once the last time you ever saw a truck driver

[01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:47.940]
wearing a cardigan sweater,

[01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:49.860]
it was the craziest thing I've seen.

[01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:50.480]
You're right.

[01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:51.460]
It isn't news time.

[01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:53.040]
See, I'm getting so wound up now.

[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:55.140]
I'm like ready to wrap it up in about 10 minutes.

[01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:57.220]
Well, then maybe a thought today.

[01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:58.680]
You can't be, Dave, he was ready to wrap it up

[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.160]
about two and a half hours ago.

[01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:05.100]
Just wait till he finds out tomorrow.

[01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:06.740]
We're going to start letting him talking a little bit.

[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:07.300]
Yeah, I know.

[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:07.620]
Yeah.

[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:09.180]
I don't know if he knows that or not.

[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:11.100]
No, well, he's not in the right union to do that.

[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:11.460]
Sure.

[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:14.860]
Listen, we got all these, it'll sound like we got a lot of people in here.

[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:15.060]
Yeah.

[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:18.420]
As we as from the first day, we had the smile on his face.

[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:18.600]
Yeah.

[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:19.100]
I'll be talking.

[01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:19.520]
I was him.

[01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:20.600]
I'd be listening to that AM.

[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:21.240]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:23.280]
We're not really eating in here, Gary.

[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:24.980]
I was listening to the news this morning.

[01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:25.860]
It's a laugh a minute.

[01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:27.100]
I'm telling you, it's fantastic.

[01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:30.120]
Go ahead, sir.

[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:32.620]
You're not going to, you're not going to work Saturdays anymore.

[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:33.280]
No chance.

[01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:34.100]
No way.

[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:35.840]
Never again.

[01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:37.900]
Because like all the bizarre collars

[01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:39.400]
call in on Saturday.

[01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:41.020]
Have you been listening this morning?

[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:41.580]
Yeah.

[01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:42.900]
Well, these are some of the leftovers.

[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:46.120]
Like now, see, they probably couldn't,

[01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:48.160]
they were probably like the only time they could call

[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:50.000]
as like early in the morning before 10.

[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:52.000]
You know that lead, you let must be the S&M

[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:52.820]
because he gave me a straw.

[01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:54.300]
Not only is it cracked in the end,

[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:56.780]
but you can't, it's like cracked all over the place.

[01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:58.380]
You can't, you can't suck anything through.

[01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:00.220]
You will collect, I tried to warn you.

[01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:00.520]
Yeah.

[01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:01.900]
Glad I was doing it.

[01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:02.200]
Look at this.

[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:02.880]
See, just drink it.

[01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:03.740]
See what you do.

[01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:04.660]
You just drink it like that.

[01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:04.880]
You drink it like that.

[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:05.000]

[01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:05.280]
You drink it like that.

[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:06.600]
Incredible.

[01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:08.700]
It's an asbestos box.

[01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:10.260]
It's good too, by the way.

[01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:10.960]
Boxo joint.

[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:11.440]
Go ahead, boxo joint.

[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:12.860]
Don't let them, don't let them,

[01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:13.980]
intimidate you.

[01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:14.880]
Go ahead, keep talking.

[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:17.860]
Reception in like bokeh is like better now

[01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:18.720]
than you're on FM.

[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:19.840]
Yeah, you hear that?

[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.800]
The reception is better and it's not crackling

[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:22.780]
and puking and popping.

[01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:25.680]
You're going to like take over FM now.

[01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:26.180]
Absolutely.

[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:27.440]
They're going to forget.

[01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:29.040]
Like grant to bridge your orientation.

[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:29.720]
You got it.

[01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:31.720]
And particularly, that's your love.

[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:32.100]
Yeah.

[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:35.520]
In fact, we had a call a little earlier from sunny.

[01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:36.580]
You want to hear.

[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.340]
I don't think you can hear it on a phone,

[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:40.180]
but the people on the air can hear it.

[01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:40.720]
Oh.

[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.120]
Okay, just a joke, sunny.

[01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:45.680]
Okay, relax.

[01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:48.340]
Don't go out and get 10 cases of grandma boon yet.

[01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:49.300]
It's not worth it, sunny.

[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:51.680]
Well, listen, it's been great hearing from you,

[01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:54.060]
but the life marches on and the call us in the morning.

[01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:55.160]
You know, like before you go to school,

[01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:57.000]
because bokeh is about as dead as a door nail.

[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:00.540]
Yeah, well, I usually leave like 60,

[01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:03.500]
like 45, so I'll expect a call from me.

[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:04.560]
All right, now how old are you?

[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:05.400]
15.

[01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:06.960]
15. See for our demographics.

[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:08.460]
We've had a 16 year old girl.

[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:09.140]
These demos.

[01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:10.840]
And a 15 year old guy in bokeh.

[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:12.580]
What we're going to do tomorrow morning is get him together.

[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:15.460]
And maybe you can skip school together tomorrow.

[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:15.780]
Yeah.

[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:16.660]
Is that sound good?

[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:17.300]
Yeah.

[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:17.780]
Okay.

[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:18.900]
Thanks a lot.

[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:19.280]
Bye, bye.

[01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:21.320]
Boy, please call us in the graphics.

[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:24.020]
I can't believe you spent that much time talking to him.

[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:26.220]
He's sitting in bed wearing his Batman pajamas

[01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:27.820]
and his asbestos shoes.

[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:30.140]
We get numbers on this show.

[01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:31.480]
Okay, now you get into it.

[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:32.080]
You'll understand.

[01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:33.000]
You'll learn.

[01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:34.360]
Look at this guy sitting over here,

[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:35.860]
sucking up that kneesh.

[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:38.600]
And 906 of them are incredible.

[01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:40.080]
Aren't they though?

[01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:40.580]
Oh, yeah.

[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:41.720]
I thought there was no eating in here.

[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:42.400]
Isn't that the reason?

[01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:45.240]
Yeah, like, you know, one of the Easter.

[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:45.900]
Yeah.

[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.520]
Standing there with his cup of coffee

[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:50.100]
and he's got his 82 raisin bagels in the office here.

[01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:51.460]
I'm not eating in that.

[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:52.440]
The beautiful studio.

[01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:54.040]
You know, yeah.

[01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:55.160]
Tell us another.

[01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:56.900]
Well, it's the first day.

[01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:57.900]
You know, we have to do something.

[01:03:58.180 --> 01:03:59.260]
Got our bananas here.

[01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:00.860]
Who's in these from a hot 105?

[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:02.440]
Yeah, that was real nice bananas.

[01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:05.640]
And we got our champagne thing from Marvin Bailey.

[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:06.380]
Marvin Bailey.

[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:07.660]
There's another one out front.

[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:08.480]
Another one.

[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:09.460]
Another basket.

[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:10.540]
There's a big basket out.

[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:11.220]
Another basket.

[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:13.900]
OK, listen, let's take a couple of these calls here

[01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:15.640]
because so far, excellent.

[01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:17.900]
Don't you want to talk about Channel 10

[01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:18.840]
for a minute while they're here?

[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:20.580]
You're going to talk about the one and only?

[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:21.180]
Yeah.

[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:23.080]
Well, look at the truck is out there.

[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:23.760]
Look who's driving.

[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:24.680]
I can't believe it.

[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:25.660]
I can't believe it.

[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:26.920]
I recognize that sweater.

[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:28.940]
That green cardigan sweater.

[01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:30.080]
I'd recognize it anywhere.

[01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:32.240]
And give Diane Magdamm our best.

[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:33.580]
Yeah, tell her we love her here.

[01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:35.640]
We know this hair place that is just,

[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.600]
OK, here's a little promo now

[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:40.940]
for our friends at Channel 10, the night at 5, 530 and 6.

[01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:42.840]
Does that mean that Michela is going to introduce this?

[01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:43.900]
Possibly.

[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.020]
Thank you very much.

[01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:46.340]
OK, OK, you can't see.

[01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:47.320]
Wow, a bunch of men.

[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:48.120]
Show them and watch it.

[01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:49.480]
Well, he's speechless.

[01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:51.780]
His lips were moving, but nothing was coming out.

[01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:52.580]
He's speechless.

[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:53.400]
It was incredible.

[01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:53.740]

[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:55.400]
Yeah, no, I don't think so.

[01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:55.900]
OK.

[01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:58.780]
7 past 9.

[01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:00.480]
Is that what it is?

[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:02.400]
And it's like 7 past 9.

[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:04.100]
Because this one says 6 past 9, OK?

[01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:05.340]
It is 7 past 9.

[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:05.680]
Yeah.

[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:08.000]
In fact, if we can keep the momentum in that,

[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:10.060]
before you know it, it'll be like 58 past 9.

[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:11.740]
I'm just moving in the head a minute.

[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:12.700]
That's right.

[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:14.140]
OK, let's take on what?

[01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:14.600]
From Dave?

[01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:16.560]
Look at his captain Dave in there.

[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:17.540]
He's with the boss.

[01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:19.800]
He just like a pig in heaven, isn't it?

[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:21.660]
OK, that's Captain Dave, of course.

[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:22.940]
Broward, hello.

[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:24.180]
Good morning, Neil.

[01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:24.820]
Yes, sir.

[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:26.580]
This is Dick from Fort Lauderdale.

[01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:28.260]
Hey, how you doing in Fort Lauderdale?

[01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:29.640]
I think I'm going to get out of this.

[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:31.000]
I'm going to get out of this.

[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:31.120]
Yeah.

[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:34.800]
Actually, I have to thank that Chucklehead

[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:37.560]
at the other end of the dial for bringing you to light.

[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:38.240]
Who's that?

[01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:39.920]
You know that Chucklehead, Joey.

[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:40.920]
Joey?

[01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:41.340]
Joey?

[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.160]
Now, did you say you're a first-time listener?

[01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:45.160]
I was in the old Rochester.

[01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:48.220]
Actually, did you avoid AM because of the static?

[01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:51.440]
You know, much receiver just don't pick it up too well.

[01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:52.460]
All right, what did Joey say?

[01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:53.360]
That, uh...

[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:54.400]
No, just every morning.

[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:58.500]
I mean, I'm telling you, he's doing more PR for you than anybody else.

[01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:07.580]
But I like...

[01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:12.580]
I know how to get him out of that room.

[01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:13.860]
Oh, boy.

[01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:14.800]
I want to ask a question.

[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:15.280]
He's gone.

[01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:17.720]
In the immediate run of the executive, John, here he goes.

[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:20.860]
And AM comes in on his, uh, radio.

[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:23.140]
What's up, Dr. Fort Cassington, sir.

[01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:23.920]
This morning.

[01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:24.880]
Oh, it is...

[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.480]
It's so good that it's frightening, isn't it?

[01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:28.260]
I like it, but I want to ask a question.

[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:30.600]
Doesn't it sound a lot like...

[01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:34.660]
Maybe you might be a little bit infringement on the hell you jackson.

[01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:38.260]
I mean, because it sounds much like off my hell you jackson.

[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:39.600]
That's what you're about to mind.

[01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:40.560]
No, you know what I mean?

[01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:42.180]
Just, you know, I am a from...

[01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:44.680]
With all due respect, I think you'll be ill in this morning, sir.

[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:46.920]
No, no, no, I really like your chance.

[01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:51.220]
But I'm telling you, the more you listen to it, just think about it.

[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:54.220]
Definitely have some dreams in a lot of good.

[01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:56.380]
Pottery, maybe we ought to take a poll on that tomorrow.

[01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:57.360]
That is an idea.

[01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:58.380]
I like it, though.

[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:00.760]
So, uh, is why does he doesn't get in trouble and be good?

[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:04.260]
He did that once with the chiffons.

[01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:04.980]
You remember that?

[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:06.420]
Oh, yeah, with the...

[01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:07.220]
Oh, yeah.

[01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:08.140]
That's right.

[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:08.940]
One fine day.

[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:10.640]
And he lost that city.

[01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:11.140]

[01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:13.720]
One fine day, Sir Greber.

[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:15.680]
In fact, we'll be playing that tomorrow, but it's too far.

[01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:17.140]
Sweet talking guy.

[01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.440]
Yeah, and Saturday in the park by Chicago.

[01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:21.780]
Program director doesn't know any of this.

[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:22.640]
He's oblivious, yeah.

[01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:23.880]
Good way to be.

[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:25.860]
And uh, Fleetwood Mac.

[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:27.800]
Oh, yeah.

[01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:29.980]
We don't hardly play Fleetwood Mac here.

[01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:32.300]
There was a Fleetwood Mac cut on our list, by the way.

[01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:34.900]
We're not going to play it, but I assume that since it was on a list,

[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.080]
it's okay for an other day, right?

[01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:36.500]
Yeah.

[01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:37.380]
Am I right? Look at that.

[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:38.860]
Yes, he goes along with anything.

[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:39.380]
Sure.

[01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:42.020]
But I'm most glad that you guys at least occurred

[01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:44.920]
you enough not to hang up on people the way that chucklehead does.

[01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:45.580]
He's a jerk.

[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:46.620]
I mean it, really?

[01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:49.860]
He's busy telling everybody how successful he's been in all these big markets.

[01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:51.780]
If he's so successful, what the hell is he doing here?

[01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:54.500]
I used to be in New York now.

[01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:56.640]
I'm in Davey, Florida, you know?

[01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:58.000]
He wants big numbers.

[01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:59.280]
Yeah, I'll give him a lot.

[01:07:59.280 --> 01:07:59.620]
Big numbers.

[01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:02.280]
Listen, you guys take it easy.

[01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:03.220]
Okay, you too.

[01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:03.820]
Okay, bye bye.

[01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:04.220]
Adios.

[01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:05.000]
How about that?

[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.240]
Very first time listener.

[01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:07.960]
Boy, that's incredible.

[01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:08.520]
Good call.

[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:09.820]
I'm sure there's many of those.

[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:10.800]
Good caller.

[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:11.580]
Yes sir.

[01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:11.920]
Good question.

[01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:12.380]
Great.

[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:13.100]
Good answer.

[01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:13.380]

[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:13.560]

[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:16.620]
One of those morons comes up.

[01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:18.060]
Give the dumbest answer in a history.

[01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:19.040]
Good answer.

[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:19.880]
Good answer.

[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:20.960]
Yeah.

[01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:23.380]
Well, it's America for you, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:24.900]
It's wonderful.

[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:26.240]
It's like it's like the football games.

[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:30.200]
You notice now that the interest is building in the SCAB games

[01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:32.820]
and the TV ratings are going back up again.

[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:33.200]
I know.

[01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:36.020]
Which basically goes to show you like one of these morons

[01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:36.780]
I was talking about.

[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:37.060]
He says,

[01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:41.020]
Well, it's pretty boring in America on Sunday without football.

[01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:43.180]
Yeah, there's nothing else.

[01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:44.740]
What kind of a commentary is that?

[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:45.080]
I know.

[01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:46.560]
What happens like the rest of the year?

[01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:46.940]
I know.

[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:47.640]
Play football.

[01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:50.300]
Just because the SCAB football is so bad.

[01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:51.560]
How bad is it?

[01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:52.760]
It's so bad.

[01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:54.000]
It's fun to watch.

[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:55.460]
I mean, these guys are genuinely.

[01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:56.760]
Awful.

[01:08:56.940 --> 01:08:57.140]
Yeah.

[01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:57.620]
Do you think glad?

[01:08:58.100 --> 01:08:58.860]
You don't watch it.

[01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:00.220]
You don't know how bad it is.

[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:00.340]
I'm just saying.

[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:01.680]
You want me to find it?

[01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:03.000]
We're already forgetting these guys' names.

[01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:04.160]
It's like Roger, Peyton.

[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:04.760]
What do I know?

[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:05.000]
Yeah.

[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:05.800]
Like it's too bad.

[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:06.140]
I forgot who they are.

[01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:08.160]
In two seconds, I can sum up how bad it is.

[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:08.420]
Okay.

[01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:08.860]
Okay.

[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:10.600]
That doesn't.

[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:11.200]
Okay.

[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:12.600]
That says his all.

[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:14.280]
Yeah, really.

[01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:18.360]
Yeah, it was like that call we got a few weeks ago from the guy who

[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:19.960]
when he found out I wasn't into sports.

[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:21.280]
He was just like so.

[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:22.500]
You're not into sports?

[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:23.700]
He was so amazed.

[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:26.160]
Like he had never met anyone in his entire life

[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:28.720]
who wasn't, you know, a game fanatic.

[01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:30.720]
And he said to me, what do you do?

[01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:32.760]
You know, what in the world do you do in your life?

[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:34.680]
I was Mr. Sports do sports again this hour?

[01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:35.820]
Or do we?

[01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:36.120]
No.

[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:36.600]
What?

[01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:37.280]
Look at that.

[01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:38.660]
What have we won?

[01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:39.400]
What have we won?

[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:40.380]
Whatever we won.

[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:41.240]

[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:42.140]
Yeah, they don't care.

[01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:43.780]
It's just as long as something's going on.

[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:43.980]
All right.

[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:45.100]
The phones keep flashing.

[01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:46.220]
They be flashing all morning,

[01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:48.000]
except that first thing in a vocal line,

[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:49.980]
which only cause when we get hostile.

[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:51.280]
Well, if you want to do sport.

[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:51.600]
You're right.

[01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:53.120]
They relate only to hostility.

[01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:54.060]
Run the whip again.

[01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:54.360]
Yeah.

[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:54.400]
Oh, no.

[01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:56.580]
That'll make them all.

[01:09:56.620 --> 01:09:57.540]
Okay, Folka, take this.

[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:00.060]
There it goes.

[01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:00.780]
It's light now.

[01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:05.220]
We're watching the line.

[01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:07.200]
Not enough yet.

[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:12.340]
Please, sir, man.

[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:12.920]
I have another.

[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:14.380]
There it comes.

[01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:16.400]
See, it works every time.

[01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:18.520]
Hello, every time.

[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:19.480]
Folka.

[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:21.800]
Oh, there they go.

[01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:22.720]
That's all right.

[01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:23.460]
That's okay.

[01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:24.160]
Hey, sure.

[01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:25.740]
Don't have to speak as long as you will.

[01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:25.940]
Oh, no.

[01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:27.280]
Can make the line light up.

[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:28.480]
Boy, they aren't really stiff up here.

[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:29.480]
I don't have to say anything.

[01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:30.680]
It's not necessary.

[01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:32.840]
You can breathe if you like it.

[01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:33.560]
It doesn't matter.

[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:33.800]
Wait a minute.

[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:34.440]
We got another one.

[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:34.700]
Hello.

[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:36.040]
No more whip.

[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:36.720]
Okay.

[01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:37.500]
No.

[01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:39.660]
What?

[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:40.580]
What the hell is this?

[01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:41.920]
But Neil can't find it.

[01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:43.560]
I mean, this is exactly like.

[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:44.460]
Oh, we're talking.

[01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:45.320]
Van O'White here.

[01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:46.000]
Yeah.

[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:47.200]
Oh, Glen, Glen.

[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:47.980]
You were.

[01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:48.380]
Wait a minute.

[01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:49.220]
You're talking with this.

[01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:49.900]
Wait a minute.

[01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:50.900]
We've reached another.

[01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:54.600]
Momentous point on this show.

[01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:55.620]
This is our first request.

[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:56.400]
That's right.

[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:57.160]
Is it?

[01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:57.760]
All right.

[01:10:58.340 --> 01:10:58.640]
Yeah.

[01:10:59.400 --> 01:10:59.760]
Okay.

[01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:00.660]
Another one in there.

[01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:01.340]
Right, dude.

[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:05.400]
Do you want to give me a little bit of music today?

[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:06.020]
Like you too.

[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:07.720]
Give him the whip.

[01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:08.720]
Yeah.

[01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:13.860]
Okay.

[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:14.240]
God.

[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:15.760]
Listen, have a wonderful life, sir.

[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:16.340]
Thank you.

[01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:17.300]
And thanks so much.

[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:18.600]
A great, Colorado book.

[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:18.720]
Okay.

[01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:21.820]
It's enough to make you sick.

[01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:14.700]
And what do you mean there's no S&F?

[01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:19.860]
All right.

[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:20.800]
I'm ready to pick, baby.

[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:24.780]
F-E-C-T-E-F-G-T-K-L-M-O-P-Q-I-T-U-S-Y-Z.

[01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:26.120]
That's your cover, man.

[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:27.600]
All right.

[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:29.740]
I'll take the sofa, the blender, the microwave,

[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:30.660]
the refrigerator.

[01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:31.780]
Hey, man.

[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:32.600]
What do you mean?

[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:33.700]
$500 for us.

[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:35.540]
Like, and white five in portable TV set.

[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:37.040]
You got ripped off, man.

[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:39.360]
My brother and uncle get it for your whole sale.

[01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:42.000]
Give me the money and I'll buy the TV set, man.

[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:42.360]
All right.

[01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:43.800]
Hey, man, come on, baby.

[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:50.280]
Get my regards to Neil Rogers.

[01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:53.460]
Tell him that I've never heard of smuddy or program in my life.

[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:54.960]
Okay, 916 on Zeta.

[01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:57.280]
And, boy, we got something big coming up.

[01:13:57.340 --> 01:13:59.880]
Now we're going to play the George Harrison record again.

[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:01.920]
Almost finished here for the day.

[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.320]
And the consensus is...

[01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:04.820]
Hell of a job.

[01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:05.600]
Hell of a job.

[01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:06.440]
First program.

[01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:06.920]
Yeah.

[01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:07.760]
Well, concerted.

[01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:08.560]
It was really good.

[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:10.000]
The audience was really excellent.

[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:10.620]
Yeah, look at that.

[01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:13.120]
Even Bokeh is calling in now that they know it's too late.

[01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:16.620]
And I think we have just enough time to listen to something very special.

[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:19.680]
We had a lot of requests for this, by the way.

[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:21.700]
And here it is.

[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:25.900]
This is one of my daddy's songs and obviously I changed the words a little bit.

[01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:27.560]
That's okay.

[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:28.840]
And this is to you, buddy.

[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:32.080]
Hello.

[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:33.880]
We are just near.

[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:38.060]
And so I'll fix my final AM callers.

[01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:39.700]
My friends.

[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:41.740]
All say I'm queer.

[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:45.400]
But I just wish I was a little callers.

[01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:49.880]
I've made a life of full.

[01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:53.680]
And now I'm going down the hallway.

[01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:57.600]
All much more than this.

[01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:00.980]
I'll do it my way.

[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:03.800]
Unbelievable, Elvis.

[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:04.680]
Yeah.

[01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:05.760]
There were times.

[01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:06.440]
There's more.

[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:12.660]
You knew when I've been old, my poem is over and I could choose.

[01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:13.320]
Oh, my God.

[01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:15.300]
Oh, through it all.

[01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:21.220]
When the world was down, I saw Jimmy Space and spit it out.

[01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:24.060]
I stole.

[01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:26.300]
But I am still small.

[01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:33.700]
I like it. Thank you very much.

[01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:34.080]
Yeah.

[01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:36.100]
There he goes. Elvis, Jr.

[01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:38.660]
And one way or the other, I know we get him on a show today.

[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:40.820]
I see you're going to have to get into all these people.

[01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:41.200]
Yeah.

[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:42.760]
I've heard Elvis, Jr. before.

[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:43.600]
And I at least care.

[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:44.460]
Chris, a lot of things.

[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:45.560]
That stuff is all new.

[01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:45.980]
Yeah.

[01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:46.760]
Jeff Striker.

[01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:48.040]
I mean, riveting stuff.

[01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:48.420]
Riveting.

[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:49.540]
You guys are killing me with this.

[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:51.160]
But you notice the AM quality.

[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:52.740]
The MSR is again Jeff Striker.

[01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:53.700]
Just in case you missed him.

[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:54.860]
That's from the way stuff, right?

[01:15:55.060 --> 01:15:55.180]
Yeah.

[01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:56.880]
Well, we let you recognize him now.

[01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:57.780]
Yeah, we keep them in a short time.

[01:15:57.780 --> 01:15:59.300]
We heard the AM quality on that card.

[01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:00.020]
All the popping.

[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:00.800]
That's what I like.

[01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:01.300]
I know.

[01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:03.360]
It sounds like it was out of the same genre.

[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:05.260]
As the Joey thing.

[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:07.120]
Well, listen, thanks a lot.

[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:08.620]
It's been something else.

[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:09.700]
Hasn't it all lines are flashing?

[01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:10.580]
Even Balkan.

[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:11.620]
Now that we're getting ready to go.

[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:11.760]

[01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:13.000]
Don's are in the other room.

[01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:15.820]
Cooking up a wicked brew of hits.

[01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:17.580]
And what can we say?

[01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:20.200]
That we will see it tomorrow.

[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:21.900]
Well, listen, tomorrow we're going to know what we're doing.

[01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:23.920]
And this was like a dry run, right?

[01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:24.200]
Exactly.

[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:25.600]
Considering all things equal,

[01:16:26.060 --> 01:16:27.540]
it's going to be great eating those conissures.

[01:16:29.060 --> 01:16:29.460]
WCTA.

[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:32.280]
Miami Beach, Fort Lauderdale, and the Palm Beaches.

[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:34.560]
Just give us your coordinates and we'll be in your board.

[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:35.440]
Say the four.

[01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:37.140]
94.9.
