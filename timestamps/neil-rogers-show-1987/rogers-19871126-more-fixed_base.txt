[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620]
Oh, he didn't.

[00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:02.920]
Just two or three cabooses.

[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.080]
Ha, ha, ha.

[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:04.720]
Listen to this.

[00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.960]
I remember your radio station WKAT.

[00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.320]
Very vaguely, yeah.

[00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.620]
Well, if you have, I...

[00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.060]
Like the audience, very vaguely.

[00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.200]
They're going to work as it starts selling time.

[00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.840]
Oh, no.

[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.660]
What do you mean by that brokering time?

[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.360]
You know, like, airtime.

[00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.200]
Oh, there's Oozzy.

[00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:24.860]
That was my Oozzy.

[00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:25.700]
I met the dog town.

[00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.220]
Ha, ha, ha.

[00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.680]
What are you talking about?

[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.180]
They're going to start selling airtime.

[00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.520]
I don't know.

[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.640]
They're going to sell time like WBCG.

[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.360]
In other words, broker time is what I said.

[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.500]
And you just kind of like, uh, ignored me.

[00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.860]
In other words, you can buy half hour.

[00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.260]
Exactly.

[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.440]
In other words, you can buy an hour, a couple of hours.

[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.180]
Maybe I'll buy some time on air.

[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:44.580]
Yeah.

[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.700]
No, I want to be on a station that somebody can hear.

[00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.320]
I also, also, that means they're getting rid of King.

[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.560]
King?

[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.580]
Barry King?

[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.840]
Not the dog, the show.

[00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.800]
Well, same difference.

[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.060]
Show is a dog.

[00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.160]
OK, I wanted to tell you what's happening at Iodong.

[00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.600]
Yeah.

[00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.220]
Not a secret anymore.

[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:01.800]
OK.

[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.540]
Jim Frank, there a news anchor in the morning.

[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:04.960]
Yeah.

[00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.360]
Leaving for Chicago.

[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.980]
Well, that's where he came from.

[00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.160]
Well, that's where he's going back to work.

[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.980]
Good luck to Jim.

[00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.040]
They really screwed him over.

[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.820]
Good over there too.

[00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:14.820]
Dr. Ben Dover.

[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.200]
Yeah.

[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.880]
OK.

[00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.020]
Bill McWake is going to do afternoon news.

[00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.840]
So somebody's going to be doing in the two.

[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.800]
Couldn't be somebody we know who's out of a job.

[00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.660]
Put it.

[00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.280]
Maybe the dingo.

[00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.720]
Go ahead.

[00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:29.460]
We're waiting.

[00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.380]
What jingle?

[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.180]
And major.

[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.400]
No, not Sam.

[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.700]
Major.

[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.500]
He's not going over there.

[00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.080]
Well, I know that they wouldn't have offered him anything.

[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.820]
And I was, that let me tell you, have my kids an idiot if I ever,

[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.160]
if I ever knew an idiot.

[00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.820]
Gee, did you just discover that?

[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.720]
Did you just finally discover that?

[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.040]
No, I called them up yesterday.

[00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.360]
I don't want to speak to him unless he knows I'm being fired.

[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.660]
Oh, I can't wait for that day.

[00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.540]
Well, hopefully that hopefully Gary will get some sense of that.

[00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.180]
I want to hear that called personally.

[00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.540]
Yeah.

[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.080]
And the last thing is with the thank God.

[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.840]
Is what?

[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.720]
The stand.

[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.960]
What about Stan?

[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.640]
He's going.

[00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.580]
Is he going to stay at wind?

[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.220]
I'll let you know tomorrow.

[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.440]
OK.

[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.100]
I want to tell you we're talking about.

[00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.340]
How long can this call go on with such term or teed even all this dead air?

[00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.600]
And these long pauses.

[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.360]
Don't you understand?

[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.220]
This is a major market morning show.

[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.040]
OK, there he goes.

[00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.400]
23.07 on Zeta 4.

[00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.880]
We apologize for that last call from our somewhat zonked out Kendall correspondent.

[00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.900]
Next time we know, we'll redeem himself and do a much better job.

[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.720]
Somebody told me that somebody was buying K18.

[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.740]
Could you hear that?

[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.040]
That I can hear that.

[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.960]
The company that I'm doing.

[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.020]
I'm doing taking Jerry Wichner lessons or something.

[00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.960]
The company that I'm like you're in a coma.

[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.680]
The company that I'm in love 94 is thinking of buying it.

[00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.280]
You know, if you look at their numbers, by the way, I hate to do that because I sound like somebody who called in the early part of the show.

[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.780]
Well, they've got like all teeny-boppers, man.

[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.260]
That's it.

[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.640]
All those kids that are hooked on that scratch crap.

[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.200]
It's always been that way over there.

[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.120]
And powerless 96.

[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.300]
If you took away their teenagers, they'd be off the air.

[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.080]
Oh, no, that's true.

[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.120]
That's very true.

[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.400]
They do phenomenal in teams, but that's it.

[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.280]
That's why I heard that Tanner does phenomenal in teams.

[00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.440]
Okay, we're going to go to Sunrise.

[00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.260]
Hello, Sunrise.

[00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.340]
Hey, good morning.

[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.240]
How are you doing now?

[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.180]
Hello, Sunrise.

[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.120]
How's my name is Igorov.

[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.780]
And I'm using all every one he was.

[00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.640]
I hear you, Roger Swoosh.

[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.160]
They're nice to me.

[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.500]
They're there, they're just to me.

[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.940]
There's just one problem.

[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.740]
They don't show rest to me.

[00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.760]
I am very happy living in this factory.

[00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.980]
And it's all because of the new round just for you.

[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.500]
It's the new round just for you.

[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.960]
Oh, I think somebody kind of hold a figure over there for just a second, don't you?

[00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.880]
Yeah, nice note.

[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.440]
He hit there.

[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.800]
I think he had another moving experience by the Fending Machine.

[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.420]
Okay, figure out certainly a pleasure to hear from you.

[00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.520]
Sure.

[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.580]
That was tight.

[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.180]
Wasn't it me?

[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.520]
I could have dubbed this.

[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.540]
You must have been God's ear.

[00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.440]
I want a grub, blah, blah, blah.

[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:42.400]
I want to help the country's in the war against the Sander Niestas.

[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.740]
Because I don't want the coming, so I'll back the war.

[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.840]
We're just bypassed Congress.

[00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.080]
We're just there's some missiles to Iran.

[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.800]
We'll say it's all point dexter's plan.

[00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.300]
Alley North was a hero.

[00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.500]
He is IQ is zero.

[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.400]
Did what he was told with those weapons he sold for the rainy and gold.

[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:09.480]
Everybody.

[00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.280]
On me, come right with.

[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.420]
Come, love, love, love.

[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.020]
And on the eye, yeah, to life.

[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.420]
Let's reflect those tankers.

[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.860]
Can come in and can't go.

[00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.940]
So on his lip, boy, you'll know that he's been for a decade.

[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.600]
But you know he deserves it.

[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.760]
That talented Greek cause his girlfriend's a thief.

[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.360]
We're just there's some time.

[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.960]
On the eye, yeah, to life.

[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.960]

[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.480]
To life.

[00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.640]
You can work with.

[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.880]
Okay, there he goes from the Martin Bourbon School of Personality.

[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.480]
709 on Zeta 4.

[00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.580]
And I'm not going to get into a big thing about Reagan.

[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.300]
You know, these people this morning.

[00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:11.400]
Bye-bye.

[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.020]
She was nice, wasn't she?

[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.000]
She was very nice.

[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.400]
So a child.

[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.740]
Did he play Alice, Blue Gown?

[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.460]
I think so.

[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.220]
No, that was the previous week when he was doing his famous cross dressing.

[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.720]
Oh, boy, that was a show.

[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:23.000]
Yeah.

[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.600]
In fact, he was running around.

[00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:29.100]
Remember in in class where Roblo was dressed up like Jesus.

[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.080]
And he was carrying that big cross.

[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.800]
Oh, it's a lot of joy.

[00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.380]
Yeah.

[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.200]
And that's exactly what Alice did.

[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.020]
He had the glass lippers and a big cross.

[00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.720]
And that was it.

[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:37.820]
And it was disgusting.

[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.940]
Okay, 26 before eight on Zeta 4.

[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:46.660]
And I am going to be so delighted when we get that exercise in whatever you call it.

[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:47.280]
What do you want to call it?

[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.220]
Exercise in ratings building over there.

[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:53.080]
See, because the people who are listening, they couldn't give a damn less about who wins the tickets.

[00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.600]
Or about Bono Hussein or whatever the name is.

[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:04.940]
And you know, that's, see, the problem is that people cater to a small group of selfish phone callers.

[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.200]
So you want to say, I've never done that.

[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:07.620]
No.

[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:08.840]
And it's not necessary.

[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.300]
No, I'm more interested in the masses out there.

[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:11.560]
Right.

[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.020]
So why are you giving this away just to be a good guy?

[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.220]
You think we ought to change our mind?

[00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.040]
Well, that would be some people upset, huh?

[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.080]
You just trying to be a good guy, right?

[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.040]
You're going to get them foaming at the mouth.

[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.180]
You know that people would love to have these tickets.

[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:22.600]
Okay.

[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:27.000]
Now ordinarily, if this our ladies' gentleman used to be Mr. Sports would do the sports.

[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.080]
And then they took him to Cleveland.

[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.160]
They started doing IDs.

[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.720]
And then I started doing the sports and I got tired of it.

[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:33.460]
I got sick of it.

[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.240]
And I said, nobody cares about these stupid scores.

[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.120]
And so that's it.

[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.500]
If you want the sports, call it.
