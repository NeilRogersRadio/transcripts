So if I sound a little tongue tied

[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.660]
You'll know it's either because Dave has been here and I'm getting excited or it's because of the chips

More on it's like you hello. Hello. How you doing? Hi, who's this is this mr. Body Wrap?

[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.740]
This is mr. Body Wrap. This is Neil. Hi, Neil. How you doing pretty good? Okay, so what?

[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.100]
I just heard you talking about

[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:24.080]
It's a body wrap or someone mentioned it to me and I own the ultra you body salon in South. They'd I just that's the one we're talking about

[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:31.660]
Oh, I just what maybe I could just to mince out our information to kind of a new situation is a lot of skepticism along with

[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.400]
96% right now efficiency factor as far as a please in our customer all right now

[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.580]
What can you do with a big fat slob like me? That's the questionnaire

[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.980]
Well, what thing we've learned Neil and that's we the person asked to decide exactly what they want to do

[00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.880]
I mean are you familiar with body by solo flex?

[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.700]
No, sir. I am no you don't know that solo flex

[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.680]
Exercise equipment that they sell oh the exercise equipment. Okay

[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.560]
No, and you've probably seen the ad that they do for that which God maddened with that kid with a wonderful body

[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.060]
When I get through with your body wrap, I want to look just like that

[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.500]
Well, what we basically do is we work on the cell you lead which is not even a medically accepted term

[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.580]
But it's the fatty toxic deposit in your body

[00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.720]
And we have a sick place solution and you are wrapped basically with our secret solutions from your neck down your toes

[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:16.980]
with your secret solution

[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:25.020]
Right, it's a sick place solution and then we have something in it which is rather expensive and totally organic and drug and chemical free

[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.180]
And we guarantee the people they must lose the least six inches on their body measurements in one visit

[00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:38.020]
Or they don't pay a penny and we guarantee in writing that it'll stay off for at least 30 days and it's not a water loss program or a

[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.400]
Cellophane wrap we even encourage them to drink our crystal springs water and

[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.360]
We've been pretty full. We haven't we've been full every day. We've been open

[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.000]
Really?

[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.560]
Yes, sir

[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.420]
I'm full right now as a matter of fact. That's what we're eating

[00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.800]
I'd like to get you in Glenn. I used to listen to your show every day now

[00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:00.320]
I'm wrapped up there at 16 hours a day. I love to speak to you gentlemen down for a complimentary wrap and you can give your unbiased view

[00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.700]
But let me just ask you a couple of questions

[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.560]
Okay, because I'm really excited about this

[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.940]
But you know we're skeptical to say the least because most of this stuff is garbage

[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.620]
No, you know that there have been a lot of commands and a lot of stuff that's been

[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:18.560]
Nothing I was afraid to call you this morning because again your listeners are going to interpret it based on whatever our comments are and I'm again

[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:24.860]
I'm taking you can tell you can play the devil's advocate and I'll try to work with you. Okay, now I will come down and do it because I'm excited about

[00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.620]
I'm here you said they're guaranteed to last at least 30 days now what happens because we did the first woman we had call said that the stuff works

[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.000]
Or at least she didn't know specifically which one we were talking about and she says what happens then is after you start drinking water

[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.740]
Is that it all comes back?

[00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:44.140]
It's guaranteed to stay up for at least 30 days and we encourage them which I don't even mention some people are there

[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:53.560]
We encourage you to drink six to eight glasses of water per day after the wrap and if any part of that inch comes back within 30 days if you let us measure you

[00:05:53.560 --> 00:06:01.580]
We will wrap you again at no charge and if it doesn't come off then we'll write you a check on the spot for the introductory wrap which is $19.50

[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:14.120]
If you go to Tahoe or California they're 85 to about 125 and a lot of them are using a different type of solution which is an herbal which does which is about 25% less taken off the individual

[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.740]
All right now what how many sessions do you have to go through on this thing?

[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:27.260]
We have people to take anywhere from five wraps up to a year. It depends on what we ask you what you want to lose then we base it on losing one pound a week without diet.

[00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:32.320]
All right now wait a minute when you say how much you want to lose how do you lose weight by this thing and not sweating it off?

[00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:38.280]
No you don't what you're doing is you're losing the toxins and we're telling you what kind of foods to eat without dieting in conjunction.

[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:49.580]
We are not we're basically an adjunct we are not a panacea or diet or exercise and by the way if you exercise every day you're not going to lose anyway.

[00:06:49.580 --> 00:07:04.220]
Most people do not know that and they think they do and they don't they work on the muscle we work on the adipose tissue which is above the muscle below the skin and that's filled with the basic fatty talk to the podges that kidneys cannot excrete and this is just medically accepted information.

[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.860]
Okay now let's see where is this located this is in Florida.

[00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:13.240]

That was really funky fresh and rock my world and on the beat box Leo rock hit it.

[00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.340]
Welcome to the W I and Z cafeteria.

I'm about a month or so. I'm going to drive in my rod and rocking to my three.

[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:59.600]
Anybody in the neighborhood that's hungry just what did I see by the way you know the guy that comes by that was there the other night.

[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:05.640]
By the way that was Derek Smith again who Cody my see and Betty Sue will play the whole thing tomorrow but enough is enough for right now.

[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:17.160]
But anyway the guy who came by who is pushing that Sadie's buffet. Oh yeah. What is his story anyway. I mean that's a guy whose whose friends with Chris remember little Chris that was on a show 12.

[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:29.420]
Now he had a birthday so he's getting all more legal every moment that's right but still little child is 12 year old boy obsessed and we can talk about him because that's why he is here because David's legal see he's in Sadie's buffet now.

[00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:34.720]
Is it we can talk about him he won't hear. OK well let's take the break first and when we come back we'll try to figure out what that's all about.

[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:41.660]
Because he's like try is right. Yeah we're going to try to figure out. He's obsessed with that whole thing.

[00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.660]
And it's only to me there's nothing worse than when somebody becomes obsessed.

[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:58.740]
Well listen we all have our thing you got your thing you always got his thing.

[00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:08.060]
So we can say that again.

[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.800]
The W I N Z 94.0 on your AM dial.

[00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:17.620]
22 past noon at the home of hysteria W I N Z.

[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:23.600]
OK let's should we take some more calls here because they seem to be flashing rather frantically here must have a lot of rappers out there.

[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.000]
Hopefully you don't want to discuss Sadie's buffet we can move on.

[00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:31.360]
Oh I forgot about that well you know there's been a lot of distraction in here in the last half two or three minutes.

[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:35.180]
Yeah the winner. And the cafeteria sent me in high a.

[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.700]
So we were talking about the Sadie's Buffet.

[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.380]
Yeah it is all the man talks about I don't know his name.

[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:47.760]
What is his story was there and he just goes on and on and on about you coupon.

[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:53.080]
He gives me these coupons and I'm sure it's a very nice place but I mean he just he's got stock in the place or what.

[00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.140]
I thought Morrison's on that place.

[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.160]
Yeah they do don't think.

[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.340]
But what is his story.

[00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.380]
I've never seen anything like that.

[00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:06.160]
I mean there I signed like eight autographs while he was rambling on and on about the Sadie's Buffet.

[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:06.880]
Oh the eight.

[00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:08.020]
Eighty.

[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.000]
Yeah eighty. It's more like it.

[00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:13.880]
I mean he's a nice guy and all of that but there's something there that doesn't meet the eye.

[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:18.820]
Yeah he introduced us to Chris which will always be grateful for Chris was great.

[00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:24.960]
And but ever since and every time he comes by he gives me like a pamphlet for Sadie's Buffet.

[00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:27.880]
Every time I see him he didn't have any pamphlets this time.

[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.620]
Did he Monday night just coupons.

[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:36.140]
He had some table scraps from yesterday.

[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:36.500]

[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.040]
Runch.

[00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:38.700]
Did you tell him you've never been there?

[00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:39.800]
Did you tell him that?

[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:40.640]
You don't have the heart.

[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:41.460]
I didn't have time.

[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:53.660]
I had four billion people looking for autographs and pictures there and I'm getting like a sermon on the mount about Sadie's Buffet and about the rope of these are the hours and you can do this and you're supposed to go at this time to beat the crowd.

[00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.280]
Why don't you go up there sometime like on a Sunday or something.

[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.360]
Check it out.

[00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:58.920]
Dave County.

[00:13:59.000 --> 00:13:59.220]
Hello.

[00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:00.060]
Neil.

[00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:00.800]
Yes sir.

[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:01.680]
How are you doing today?

[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:02.560]
Okay bud.

[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:03.080]
Good.

[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.120]
I was up one day and I saw you guys.

[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.120]
I had a great time.

[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:06.860]
Good.

[00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.080]
It was really great.

[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.520]
I'll tell you that bird.

[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:10.940]
I don't know.

[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.760]
I walked by and I got my Christmas goose a little early to see you.

[00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:16.120]
Get serious sir.

[00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:17.940]
I don't know about that guy.

[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:18.700]
I know.

[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.100]
I think he munged on my shirt too.

[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.140]
It was close to my shirt.

[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:24.060]
Well that's possible.

[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.380]
Very likely.

[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.100]
What do you want to speak of phone?

[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:27.780]
Yeah.

[00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:28.520]
Sound.

[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:29.120]

[00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:30.440]
That's why we like it.

[00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:33.840]
Hey I saw the movie Extremity.

[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:34.680]
You saw it?

[00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:35.200]
Yeah.

[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:40.440]
It was a good movie except I thought the ending was really stupid.

[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:41.740]
They should have killed that guy.

[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:47.860]
Okay if anybody is listening or hasn't seen it you just killed all of it.

[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.200]
Okay.

[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.960]
It's still a cable for weeks already so it's their problem.

[00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:52.380]
You know.

[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:59.080]
They're going to turn this guy over to the police and he's going to get out with some wire.

[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.100]
I mean wire you know.

[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.640]
And he's going to call back and tell him again.

[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.440]
I mean he wants to point the movie.

[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.040]
I mean if she had killed him and died I'm like you want to tell.

[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.580]
Better would have been a great movie.

[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:09.720]
Would have said something you know.

[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.220]
Right Neil?

[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:12.940]
Yeah.

[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.600]
Yeah you're really excited about this phone call.

[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.740]
Yeah I'm eating is that okay?

[00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.780]
I mean I'm one of your most developed fans.

[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.320]
I mean I'm not a crazy fan.

[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:24.520]
I don't want to piece your body around you.

[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.680]
Well nobody else does either so don't worry about that.

[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.740]
Where are you calling from by the way?

[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.840]
That background noise is really interesting.

[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.140]
I'm calling from North Miami.

[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:32.740]
Oh.

[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:34.620]
Well that explains it.

[00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:35.220]
That explains it.

[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.680]
You know I just want to say you know.

[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.360]
I'm in New York.

[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:38.600]

[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:42.460]
You're only that year in Stan and I'm even sort of bird in.

[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:42.880]
I don't know why.

[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:43.520]
And Trillman.

[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.140]
Like next time you make a big pot of soup.

[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.000]
Trillman you know.

[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:53.120]
You guys are two entertainers with the coolest meaning of the word.

[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:57.640]
You know you're not these you know Madonna or Michael Jackson superstar.

[00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:00.680]
You guys talked to us for eight hours a day.

[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:01.200]
You bet.

[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.020]
Entertainer.

[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:02.620]
It's murder.

[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:04.200]
Entertainer.

[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:07.980]
I mean there are many people in this world that can entertain me because I'm a tough audience.

[00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:10.400]
And I just want to thank you for being here.

[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.380]
Well tell our management that would you please?

[00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:14.200]
I mean I think a lot of people.

[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.100]
They have a motto here.

[00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:18.240]
When in question or in doubt running circles screaming show.

[00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:22.040]
No the area is running around little circles in the atrium.

[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.540]
Oh this guy is falling.

[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:24.940]
This you know calm down relax.

[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.520]
You know leave us alone.

[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.500]
It's you know there are many people like you entertain us.

[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:33.860]
You know even these so called comedians they put on HBO and cinematics.

[00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:34.800]
I mean they're mom.

[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.540]
Yeah you can say that again.

[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:41.220]
You are you are real me and you know I didn't really get to talk to you because I got their way.

[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:45.000]
I was soaked and there was no in screaming crazy people around you.

[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.940]
Yeah there were a lot of screamers there all right.

[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:52.620]
But there was a great crowd and those kind of people I really appreciate what you would stand there.

[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.500]
Because like I said you are true entertainers.

[00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:59.480]
And there's no one that tells you you know the media or a record business.

[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:01.400]
So show business I can touch you.

[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:02.240]
I really mean that.

[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.160]
Well I don't know about that.

[00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:05.660]
There's some of them that could touch me but I don't think I can.

[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.020]
I can't engage with anybody.

[00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:08.800]
Yeah now you're talking.

[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:09.800]
Oh this is a good caller.

[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:10.180]
Yeah.

[00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:11.780]
This is a good caller.

[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.780]
I bet you did you put it on free-sframe.

[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.760]
No I'm not you know I don't go that way.

[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:24.140]
Oh listen I saw I saw the previews for about last night with Rob Lowe.

[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.620]
And the previews that I saw he seemed to be rather naked in most of them.

[00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:30.340]
Yeah it's a good movie.

[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:30.900]
Is it?

[00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:34.880]
It's not a great movie but it's interesting.

[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.640]
You know there's some good action and I mean that's good action.

[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:38.420]
That's what I like.

[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:39.740]
It's in Belouch he's really.

[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:41.080]
He's close and funny.

[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:41.520]
Yeah.

[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.960]
Which is rare because it's not where I don't like him.

[00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.120]
But no he's just playing on his brother's name.

[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.560]
You know I'm just like everybody plays on their brother's name.

[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:48.780]
Sure.

[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.080]
Look at the bird.

[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:52.860]
I mean Michael Jackson is playing on his sister's name.

[00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:55.000]
You bet and on his sister's body too.

[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.580]
And one of his things guess the rest of the day is his?

[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:00.140]
Yeah.

[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:04.480]
Yeah I tell you real nice guy but I mean I'm nothing negative on him.

[00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:05.940]
I just thought I think he's kind of dead.

[00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:07.340]
I mean if I was sitting there I'd be crying.

[00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.220]
They're ignoring me still they're ignoring me.

[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:10.500]
I don't hear anything from his name.

[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.400]
They're all ignoring me today.

[00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:13.580]
I don't know what it is.

[00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:16.480]
You know I mean because I just said you're correct.

[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.640]
Let me tell you put that Joey Reynolds thing on.

[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.100]
I got a piece of the man.

[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:31.460]
Yeah.

[00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:31.880]
Yeah.

[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:31.880]

[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:32.100]
Go ahead.

[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:36.080]
When I go to sleep at night I got the clock radio gone.

[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:40.700]
And I just didn't happen to be on WFHC because I don't listen to what I just need.

[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.040]
And Rad music to wake you up.

[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:47.260]
So the other day he went off my long-lost at six o'clock in the morning and he was playing

[00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.780]
that lead and he must have gone to use somebody.

[00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:50.560]
Really?

[00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:52.600]
First thing I heard about it.

[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.860]
I'm on TV.

[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:04.340]
I'm on TV.

[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.220]
I'm on TV.

[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.000]
I'm on TV.

[00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:06.280]
I'm on TV.

[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:06.600]
I'm on TV.

[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:06.600]

[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:06.600]

[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:06.600]

[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:06.600]

[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:06.600]

[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:06.600]

[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:06.620]
I'm on TV.

[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:06.620]

[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:06.620]

[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:06.640]
I'm on TV.

[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:06.640]

[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:06.740]

[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:06.740]

[00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:07.360]
I'm on TV.

[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:07.640]
I'm on TV.

[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:08.060]
I'm on TV.

[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:08.060]

[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:08.060]

[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:08.380]
I'm on TV.

[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.000]
I'm on TV.

[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.240]
I'm on TV.

[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:22.580]
I'm on TV.

[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:23.680]
I'm on TV.

[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:23.700]
I'm on TV.

[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:23.700]

[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:23.700]

[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:23.700]

[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:25.620]
Well I told you it was possible.

[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.940]
Do you believe that they're doing cartwheels and you believe that?

[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:35.640]
Why should today's am the devil," there isn't everything fine?"

[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.540]
Why should today be any different than everyday?

[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.520]
Is not the name of somebody who used to work for ATர Goodford, I think?"

[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.080]
I don't think so.

[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.200]
Are you ever headed any Jews working for them?"

[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:48.680]
No way.

[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.540]
That's why they named it street after my Miami Beach.

[00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:52.180]
Okay, let's go to Broward.

[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:52.440]
Hello.

[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:54.020]
Oh, dude.

[00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:55.160]
Yeah, dude.

[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.140]
What's happening, dude?

[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:57.580]
This is Joey.

[00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:03.100]
Dude, uh, I need to donate a couple of minutes for this nonprofit organization.

[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.240]
Joey, who?

[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:06.700]
Joey Reynolds.

[00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:08.280]
It does something.

[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:17.460]
Go ahead, Joey.

[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.660]
I got some questions.

[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:18.660]

[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:18.660]

[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:18.660]

[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:18.660]

[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:18.660]

[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:18.660]

[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:18.660]

[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.100]
What can we do for you, Joey?

[00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:23.240]
Uh, uh, what's he eat for Thanksgiving?

[00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:26.720]
Boy, now that is a...

[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:27.640]
What a question.

[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:34.920]
Uh, uh, comment for the bird is if he would have, uh, had this day Vaughn when you were gone instead of the Dave Barry, you might have had a decent chill.

[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:35.460]
Yeah.

[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.980]
And also, I was gonna have to bird how he knows Michael Jackson.

[00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:46.860]
Because I noticed in that when you play the, uh, beat it song, he coughs about holding, uh, going hill in his hands.

[00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:52.680]
So, I think you have something that's going around.

[00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:56.240]
Glenn Hill disease.

[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:56.720]
Yeah.

[00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:02.500]
Yeah, you've got the, uh, one of those rare bird diseases, you know, Glenn Hill disease.

[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.520]
I just want to lean next to you for a while.

[00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:06.640]
Well, okay.

[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:07.280]
Bye, Neil.

[00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:07.960]
Wait a minute.

[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:09.640]
What do you do for tonight?

[00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:13.720]
Your eyes are so lovely.

[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:16.560]
You're not this lovely.

[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:17.000]
Oh, yeah.

[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:17.740]
Oh, yeah.

[00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:19.360]
Oh, yeah.

[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:20.980]
Did you say Jolly or Jeff?

[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.040]
You can stay over here.

[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:23.800]
I'll listen to Jeff.

[00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:26.140]
That's what I thought.

[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:27.860]
I just wanted to touch you.

[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.940]
By the way, Neil, you'll be disappointed in about last night.

[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:33.540]
Will I?

[00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:35.220]
Yeah, the movie's a thing.

[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.220]
Well, what do you think of that, mate?

[00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:40.120]
They don't show that much of Roblo.

[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:40.860]
Really?

[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.220]
Now, they show more of his girl.

[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:43.800]
Okay, well...

[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:44.520]
Glenn all like it.

[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:44.940]
Good.

[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.240]
I didn't really like it.

[00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.620]
Dimmie Moore is real cute, but...

[00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:48.960]
Dimmie Moore?

[00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:50.180]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.280]
But, um, it's not much of a movie.

[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.760]
I like it.

[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:54.520]
Dave liked it.

[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:55.560]
What did you like about it, Benz?

[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.100]
Diddly Moore.

[00:21:58.740 --> 00:21:59.420]
Diddly Moore.

[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:00.520]
Diddly Moore.

[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:01.640]
Oh, that's what you're into.

[00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:02.480]
Short ugly guys.

[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:02.920]
Okay.

[00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.280]
Bruce Willis' girlfriend, this is Carl.

[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:06.980]
Dimmie Moore.

[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:08.140]
Really?

[00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:09.120]
Is that right?

[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.100]
Okay, thanks a lot, pal.

[00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:10.920]
Okay.

[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.640]
Dimmie Moore is a Bruce Willis girl.

[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.360]
Dimmie Moore.

[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.780]
He's one of the most hilarious morons ever got a fight.

[00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:18.940]
I thought she married, um, Emilio Estromes.

[00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:20.720]
Did Emilio Estaves?

[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.580]
Isn't that who married Emilio?

[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.180]
Well, I can't remember.

[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.460]
Oh, here comes...

[00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:27.860]
All right, here comes Emilio Estaves.

[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:28.700]
Well, the W.I.N.Z.

[00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.960]
LaBottom is, please report to the Fox studio.

[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:32.640]
And it's announced...

[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:33.540]
Oh, yeah.

[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:35.040]
Dimmie.

[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:36.480]
Yeah, Dimmie Moore.

[00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:37.100]
Dimmie.

[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.760]
Now, they were the ones that were saying...

[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.300]
Dimmie was in the exorcist.

[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.140]
Why do you want you to do this to me, Dimmie?

[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:43.740]
Right.

[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:44.520]
You're right.

[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:45.660]
That's right.

[00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:46.620]
Do you remember that?

[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:47.340]
The priest mother.

[00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:47.840]
Yeah.

[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:48.660]
I remember.

[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.340]
And he kept envisioning her walking down the subway.

[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:51.860]
Yeah.

[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:53.480]
Remember that?

[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:53.920]
Yeah.

[00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:55.860]
Did you see the exorcist?

[00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.800]
No, I didn't.

[00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:58.960]
Are you serious?

[00:22:59.500 --> 00:22:59.620]
Are you alive?

[00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:01.160]
I didn't even realize that.

[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:01.600]
You didn't even realize that.

[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:01.840]
I didn't realize that.

[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:03.040]
Why not?

[00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:05.020]
I didn't seem like a good movie at all.

[00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:05.940]
Are you serious?

[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:06.140]
I'm not.

[00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:07.560]
You're getting me one of the greatest in history.

[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:08.040]
So long.

[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:09.260]
I don't have to watch it.

[00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:10.980]
Wouldn't you always want to have Linda Blair?

[00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:12.680]
They're puking pea soup all over you.

[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.600]
How could you have dream of yours?

[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:15.460]
I'll rent them with you.

[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:16.000]
God.

[00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:17.020]
I have.

[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.140]
I happen to have it at home, but, you know.

[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:20.020]
I have.

[00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:23.340]
26 till 1.

[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:24.160]
It's the joke.

[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:25.440]
Not necessarily.

[00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:25.960]
Well, right.

[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:27.800]
26 till 1 at WINZ.

[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.260]
And everybody seems to be really coming to life now.

[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:31.640]
We have a lot of attention in the building.

[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:32.440]

Okay, there's a little...

[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.380]
Oh, not on that.

[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:10.820]
Okay, there's a little...

[00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:10.820]

Oh, not on that.

[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:35.560]
Go ahead, sir.

[00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:37.820]
Don't let us bother you.

[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:40.260]
Um, I spoke to the bird yesterday because I was calling you.

[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:41.140]
But you weren't there.

[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:41.980]
You had a really loud voice.

[00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:42.740]

[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:46.900]
And I guess they're really cute little laugh, you know.

[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:47.440]
I like that.

[00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:47.940]
Really?

[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:48.440]
Yeah.

[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:50.060]
That's an interesting thing too.

[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:51.160]
Kill something inside of it.

[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:53.520]
This could be the biggest start of something good for you here now.

[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:53.880]
Yeah.

[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.060]
Listen, did you get the invitation to the Strand?

[00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:57.200]
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

[00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.720]
Didn't you call and tell them we can't go?

[00:29:59.180 --> 00:29:59.400]
No.

[00:29:59.740 --> 00:29:59.880]
No.

[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.980]
Well, I appreciate it, but short notice, you know.

[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:04.820]
Oh, okay.

[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.200]
The thing has something on it.

[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:06.940]
Wow.

[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.000]
This is great.

[00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:08.340]
Ah.

[00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:09.780]
Ah.

[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:10.520]
Uh-oh.

[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:11.260]
Uh-oh.

[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:11.320]
Uh-oh.

[00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:13.880]
Sir, I want to tell you something.

[00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:15.380]
What was that?

[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.140]
I think I just died and went to heaven.

[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:20.120]
This cheesecake.

[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:21.440]
Wake up your taste buds.

[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:23.140]
Wake up your taste buds.

[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:25.280]
This is so good that it's orgasmic.

[00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:27.940]
This makes sex seem like just a little tickle on the toe.

[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.340]
I'm telling you, it's just unbelievable.

[00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:33.640]
You can't eat cheesecake and have an herbal wrap, too, you know.

[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:36.400]
Well, that's not said a little later in the week.

[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.960]
All things must pass, you know what I mean?

[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.560]
Listen, how do you get Bob Martinez out of office?

[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.860]
With a whooping crane, I guess, I don't know.

[00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:47.120]
No, no, no, it's not a joke.

[00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:48.500]
Oh, I don't have any idea.

[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.760]
Why are you asking that in the middle of this show?

[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:51.440]
Is that...

[00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:53.540]
It's that I have to get him out of there, are you?

[00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:54.080]
Don't play me.

[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:54.980]
I didn't vote for him.

[00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:55.880]
He's a maniac.

[00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:57.360]
A moron, a douche.

[00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:58.360]
What can I tell you?

[00:30:58.820 --> 00:30:59.220]
I don't know.

[00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:02.000]
Run out in the streets and ask all those idiots that voted for him.

[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.120]
What's the address of that ice cream shop that you go to?

[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:06.080]
No, no, no more.

[00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:06.800]
No more?

[00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:08.580]
No more freebies from us.

[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:09.740]
No, no, no.

[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:10.520]
We don't go there anymore.

[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:13.640]
We did our thing and we wish them the best and good luck to them.

[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:14.860]
Now we move on to other things.

[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:15.640]
Okay.

[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:16.460]
It was great.

[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:20.220]
Going to be at the melting pot Friday night having fondue.

[00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:21.280]
Uh-huh.

[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.060]
And who's joining you?

[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:24.780]
I will be.

[00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:27.540]
Dave is going to be the waiter and Stan Major will be there.

[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:30.540]
And we have Sharon and her one of her several boyfriends.

[00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:32.760]
And whoever, however,

[00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:35.320]
however, else makes reservations for dinner, 9 p.m. Friday.

[00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:36.220]
How about Joshua?

[00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:37.460]
No, no.

[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:38.600]
We're not, can't listen.

[00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:40.140]
Can't you get this out of your mind?

[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.960]
That's all over with now.

[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:43.060]
Oh, it's all over with.

[00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:45.640]
Those people have to go on and live their lives and do their thing.

[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:49.260]
You know, they're very sensitive up there and, uh, that's it.

[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:50.700]
Okay.

[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:53.000]
You're going to go to the strand, though, to see Polar.

[00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:57.700]
I think this guy's got a little hearing problem.

[00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:01.500]
I said, we appreciate it very much, but it's just not in the cards right now.

[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:01.800]
Okay.

[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:02.220]
Okay.

[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:02.900]
How about next month?

[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:04.760]
Well, we'll see.

[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:05.560]
Okay.

[00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:06.500]
Check our calendar.

[00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:08.320]
Okay. Good luck to you, sir.

[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:08.620]
What?

[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:12.200]
I think he was, uh, he doesn't want to hear a phenomenal or what?

[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:13.560]
Better than it ought to be.

[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:14.560]
It's better than anything.

[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:14.760]
Yeah.

[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:16.120]
Does yours have green things in it?

[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:17.120]
It's just mine.

[00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:19.320]
Don't worry about it.

[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:20.900]
Green things.

[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:21.260]
Yeah.

[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:22.400]
There's little green things in it.

[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:23.040]
I don't know what it is.

[00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:23.620]
Are they alive?

[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.800]
It's like green peppers or how peppers are something?

[00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:27.260]
Is it good or what?

[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:28.220]
It's great.

[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:29.620]
Well, don't like pick through it.

[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:29.920]
Okay.

[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.040]
Like, even if you don't go on, don't worry about it.

[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.320]
Just eat it and if it's good, that's all you need to know.

[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:35.660]
All right.

[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:37.060]
Is it good?

[00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:37.920]
Mm-hmm.

[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:38.440]
Okay.

[00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:40.100]
Talking with his mouth full again.

[00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:42.300]
I wonder what they call this.

[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:46.980]
This is, um, it says strutle, but they strutle by the strip.

[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:52.320]
And, um, this is strutle with cheese cake inside.

[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:55.740]
And it's like diatetic because the cheese is evidently like ricotta or something.

[00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:57.100]
Do you think so?

[00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:57.640]
Mm-hmm.

[00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:58.720]
That's what it looks like.

[00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:00.780]
Mm-hmm.

[00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:01.320]
Mm-hmm.

[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:02.940]
Mm-hmm.

[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.360]
Better than it ought to be.

[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:15.560]
Boy, I am telling you, wow, you have never, ever tasted anything like this in your life.

[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:18.000]
Those green things are great.

[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:18.920]
What are they?

[00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:20.060]
I don't know, but they're great.

[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:22.080]
They don't worry about what they are.

[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:23.260]
We're about what they used to be.

[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:23.520]
Okay.

[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:24.740]
That's what the story is.

[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:27.260]
What they were many moons ago.

[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:29.880]
I don't know what it is.

[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:32.860]
The ancient Greeks planted those.

[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:34.340]
Mm-hmm.

[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:36.920]
And they've been, uh, grouting ever since.

[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:37.300]
Okay.

[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:38.480]
I know.

[00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:39.520]
What a sense of humor.

[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:42.740]
I wasn't going to tell them where they planted those, but look at that.

[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:43.580]
He's picking through it.

[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:44.660]
They're like, they're raisins.

[00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:45.400]
They're raisins.

[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:45.680]
Yeah.

[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:47.980]
Strutle has raisins in it.

[00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:48.220]
Yeah.

[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:49.980]
You haven't you ever had apple strutle?

[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:51.020]
Yeah.

[00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:52.820]
I know I had one with raisins in it, though.

[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:54.080]
Oh, but that's the best.

[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:56.420]
Strutle isn't strutle without raisins in it.

[00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:59.720]
What kind of goyam am I surrounded by here?

[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.900]
You know, what, what, what is this?

[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:03.420]
Maniacs.

[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:05.500]
Isn't tomorrow yum kipper?

[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:07.520]
Is it again?

[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:08.640]
No, what do you mean, if you?

[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.040]
Oh, God.

[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:12.300]
Why don't you wish everybody a happy yum kipper?

[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:12.900]
Happy yum kipper.

[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:13.760]
No, come on.

[00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:14.620]
It's just a joke.

[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:16.220]
It's not a happy home, though.

[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.740]
It's a, it's it's a day of a.

[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:19.700]
Oh, boy.

[00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:20.660]
It's the day of a.

[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:22.320]
Oh, happy holiday.

[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:23.400]
Yeah, happy.

[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:24.900]
Happy, happy holiday.

[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:26.000]
Happy holiday.

[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:26.340]
Jeez.

[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:27.860]
What a media cup.

[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:28.160]

[00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:29.720]
Good God.

[00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:30.680]
From barrison.

[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:32.880]
Yeah, happy good Friday.

[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.000]
What a schmuck.

[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:37.840]
What a schmuck.

[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:38.520]
What a schmuck.

[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.040]
What a schmuck.

[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:40.660]
What a schmuck.

[00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:41.380]
What a schmuck.

[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:42.880]
What a schmuck.

[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.280]
What a schmuck.

[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.220]
Is it really?

[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:45.440]
Yeah, it's really easy.

[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:49.840]
I just, I ordinarily, you have never seen me just lose it over food.

[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.400]
I mean, we've had some good stuff come in here.

[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:55.740]
Well, I've lost it over some other things, but nothing personal, Dave.

[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:56.160]
Just relax.

[00:34:58.300 --> 00:34:58.980]
No, you never.

[00:34:59.100 --> 00:34:59.420]
Is it good?

[00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:00.080]
Mm-hmm.

[00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:02.060]
You never get this excited over food.

[00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:02.320]
Look at him.

[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:05.460]
He's like, seriously, like in heaven.

[00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:06.740]
This made the whole day worthwhile.

[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:07.320]
Yeah.

[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.540]
Well, you must have been, now we took good care of you here the last two days, right?

[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:11.980]
Yeah, so, so.

[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:13.820]
You sure get your alarm go off.

[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:15.660]
Just, he's just a little joke.

[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:16.340]
It's just this show.

[00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:18.500]
It's right, it's just a radio show schnuck.

[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:21.580]
Okay, let's take another call.

[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:22.680]
It's amazing.

[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.080]
We're having such a good time in here.

[00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:25.680]
It's like, how dare you.

[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:27.580]
Yeah, Kios is the word.

[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:28.680]
Kios radio.

[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:30.520]
Dave County.

[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:30.820]
Hello.

[00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:32.160]
Welcome to W-I-N-Z.

[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:32.760]
Hi.

[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:33.480]

[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:34.460]
How is lunch?

[00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:36.020]
It is phenomenal.

[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:37.160]
Phenomenal.

[00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:38.780]
It is orgasmic.

[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:43.800]
I, I right now am inspired by the career opportunities of...

[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:47.700]
of broadcasting because I pick up free lunch on the radio.

[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:48.220]
You bet.

[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:49.480]
Freebies everywhere.

[00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:50.640]
It's great.

[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:55.120]
I mean, I, I pick up what to run out and become a broadcast strip some sort now.

[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:59.720]
That's why Stan got into what he didn't understand that we're talking about food though when he, they said freebies.

[00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:04.640]
Well, you know, you gotta leave Stan alone a little bit, you know.

[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:05.460]
You don't want to pick on him.

[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.080]
He doesn't, he doesn't want to be left alone.

[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:10.020]
Well, I got to listen to him in the afternoon.

[00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:13.780]
So, you know, you want to, you want to keep him in a happy mood because when he gets there,

[00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:14.460]
he's in a bad mood.

[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:15.960]
He's no fun to talk or listen to.

[00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:16.400]
That's true.

[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:17.740]
He gets very, uh, surly.

[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:18.620]
Yeah, he's good.

[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:22.820]
I mean, what I noticed about your show, finally, is why I've been listening to the past few months.

[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:24.360]
It's actually entertaining.

[00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:26.620]
Oh, you finally discovered that.

[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:27.040]
That's good.

[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:28.500]
I discovered why I've been listening.

[00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:33.820]
And today on the way home from school, I was saying, uh, my oh my, this is a fun show today.

[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:37.280]
And you guys, having a good time today, I can hear you.

[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:40.040]
It's a good time for the, uh, great taste of lunch.

[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:43.680]
Yeah, I guess so, but let's not, let's not play that tape because...

[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:45.200]
No, let's boycott, Hyde Ray.

[00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:47.320]
We're gonna boycott him.

[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:49.080]
You know, I wouldn't listen to him anyways.

[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:52.920]
I mean, uh, I've been starting to listen to your station all day long now.

[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:53.400]
Good.

[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:54.400]
You know, the news and everything.

[00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:55.380]
Tell the management that.

[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.760]
Tell the, uh, nervous psychotic management that.

[00:36:58.680 --> 00:36:59.960]
Oh, I got it.

[00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:00.420]
I got it.

[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:01.400]
I got it.

[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:01.720]
I got it.

[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.620]
Is this guy actually falling?

[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:03.960]
Yeah.

[00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:05.740]
In the 80s.

[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:08.280]
I've not lost all the hair yet from pulling it out or just some of it.

[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:08.920]
I don't know.

[00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:11.620]
I don't know, but, uh, your show is just...

[00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:13.660]
I think, I think we're gonna send Gary for a head rat.

[00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:16.440]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:18.900]
Oh, I've just been having so much fun today listening.

[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:19.400]
I know.

[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:24.240]
All right, just had to call in and tell you that today is, I think one of the better shows I've ever heard.

[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:24.780]
Really?

[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:26.320]
Let's be, could you hear that?

[00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:27.720]
I must be because David's here today, huh?

[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:28.640]
He just figured it out.

[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.660]
Yeah, I mean, this has been so much fun.

[00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:35.360]
Yeah, David's just, you know, good spirited solos here to eat a little and laugh a lot, you know?

[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:37.400]
Yeah, it's, it's a good show.

[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:38.780]
It's, it's really great.

[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.660]
Um, I'll call the management for you.

[00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:41.900]
Yeah, look it up in the phone book.

[00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:50.320]
Okay, sir, I just, I couldn't, I couldn't restrain myself.

[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:53.220]
It's, it cracks me up every time as well as the other caller.

[00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:57.980]
I, you know, these, these little tapes you have and everything are, are incredible.

[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.020]
All right, now I want to make my last offering.

[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:01.460]
I have one piece of this left.

[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:02.300]
I'm making it to Kyle.

[00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:05.440]
I'm telling you, trust me, saving it for you.

[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:06.160]
You don't want it.

[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:06.980]
That's okay, I understand.

[00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:09.160]
But I wouldn't steer you wrong.

[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:15.560]
Okay, there's been a lot of food here over these last three and a half years, but I am telling you my hand of the sky that if you eat this,

[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.180]
it'll make up for a lot of these calls.

[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:19.260]
Trust me.

[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:21.080]
Okay, thanks a lot.

[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.040]
All right, thank you.

[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:22.640]
I'll read the air.

[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:24.280]
2468 hike.

[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:30.740]
By the way, a stand was a little confused yesterday, but it does appear the networks are going to televised the scab game.

[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:31.180]
Oh, yeah.

[00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:36.700]
So those of you who've been picking and scratching out there because of the strike and are just healing up right now,

[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:40.300]
you can kind of match your scabs to the ones on the field this weekend.

[00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:46.260]
Yeah, Gary was here from Dauphin Digest about an hour ago and he said that Dauphin's are definitely getting their scabs together.

[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:49.720]
And they are going to play a scab game.

[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:50.900]
Okay, because it's in Heelvice self.

[00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:53.820]
Let's get all the scabs in town together and heal them up for you.

[00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:54.640]
No, he said it's true.

[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:57.800]
We could get the earnest angely in here to heal up everybody scabs by the weekend.

[00:38:58.680 --> 00:38:59.040]
Right?

[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:02.660]
And of course, they're going to be just tremendous following for that.

[00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:04.600]
I say a plague on all of them.

[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:06.620]
It's going to be like, say what?

[00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:08.940]
It's going to be right up there with Arena football, I think.

[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:10.620]
Yeah, it's going to be right on the same level.

[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:13.120]
Our resident sports at Mr. Sports over here.

[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.020]
Before you know, that's my favorite arena football.

[00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:15.560]
Yeah.

[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.580]
It's almost as good as indoor soccer.

[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:19.940]
Yeah.

[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:21.540]
This, I'm telling you.

[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:23.080]
And of course, the tractor pulls.

[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.300]
I don't know what to say about this.

[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:25.800]
Am I right? Am I exaggerating?

[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:26.800]
You are not exaggerating.

[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:27.680]
No, it's the best.

[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:28.120]
It is.

[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:29.360]
She's kick I've ever had.

[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:32.080]
Didn't you have a little sexual excitement when you went this?

[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:34.840]
Yeah, I felt something strange happening below.

[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:35.700]
Well, just wait.

[00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:38.800]
Okay, it's a 74-watted W.I.N.C.

[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.380]
World Cup right back.

[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:40.720]
Yeah.

[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:41.800]
And W.I.N.C.

[00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:44.400]
And welcome to Bird Brain Radio, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:46.540]
Let's take a call from Dave County.

[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:46.880]
Hello.

[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:48.380]
One of my favorites.

[00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:49.720]
Now is there someone there?

[00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:50.180]
No.

[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.360]
I'm told you just a finger is there.

[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:54.220]
I want to tell you which one.

[00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:54.760]
Hello.

[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:55.660]
Hello, Neil.

[00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:56.080]
Hi.

[00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:58.840]
This is the Animita Bull's Nancy Holley.

[00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:00.160]
Nancy, how are you?

[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:01.040]
Fine.

[00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:03.000]
They called you for Walter U.I.H.

[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.060]
He certainly did.

[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:04.560]
Right.

[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:07.660]
I want you to know the gentleman's name is with you is Dave.

[00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:08.500]
Yes.

[00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:11.020]
I don't need pictures.

[00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:13.780]
And you don't need to see him because long as my family knows

[00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:16.040]
and everything knows I lost, that's all that matters.

[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:17.600]
You're not that important, Neil is.

[00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:19.680]
Oh, that was a little shot.

[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:20.500]
Now don't be nervous.

[00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:21.080]
I didn't just joke.

[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:21.840]
No, that's good.

[00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:22.660]
It was a little shot.

[00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:24.520]
I don't move that far away.

[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:27.680]
If I was there I'd come down and show you pictures before and after.

[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.760]
She didn't like what you said.

[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:29.000]
Oh.

[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:29.760]
No, no, no.

[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:30.120]
I don't.

[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:32.280]
You're taking them seriously not only show.

[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:33.660]
Yeah, it's just a radio show.

[00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:34.060]
God.

[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:36.740]
No, but I went down and...

[00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:38.000]
I'm losing you for some reason.

[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:41.360]
Your ankles all the way up to your bus neck, everything.

[00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:41.800]
Yeah.

[00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:43.760]
And I did lose eight and three quarter inches.

[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:44.720]
It was amazing.

[00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:45.960]
And how long?

[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.180]
Just once?

[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:49.020]
One visit.

[00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:49.820]
Oh, boy.

[00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:51.980]
One of the girls in the office won her first visit.

[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:53.580]
You're 17 and three quarter inches.

[00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:54.580]
Holy Toledo.

[00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:57.020]
And how many times do you go back?

[00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.460]
I'm going back again tomorrow.

[00:40:58.920 --> 00:40:59.980]
But like it's all stayed off?

[00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:05.700]
It stayed off and the woman that called it said about the saran wrap.

[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:08.180]
This, you're being wrapped like an ace bandages.

[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:09.280]
Oh, I see.

[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:10.320]
Like a mummy.

[00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:11.720]
It's weird.

[00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:14.320]
You look like a mummy by the time you're finished.

[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:15.960]
Some of us already look like a mummy.

[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.900]
Well, I'm not a mummy but I look like a mummy that night.

[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:21.320]
But they wrap you and everything.

[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.760]
And as they unwrap you, you can see the difference.

[00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:24.620]
Really?

[00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:26.180]
It was amazing.

[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.580]
My family thought it was amazing.

[00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:30.000]
People that know me looked at me one day.

[00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:31.400]
And then they said, what'd you do overnight?

[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:32.580]
I said nothing.

[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:34.380]
And a lot of people don't know where I went.

[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:35.960]
Of course, now they know where I went.

[00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:38.620]
But that's why it says it was.

[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:39.640]
What was it, the crazy horse?

[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.560]
No, just a joke, Nancy.

[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:42.240]
Just a joke.

[00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:43.120]
I didn't hear it.

[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:44.520]
I was said to the crazy horse.

[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:45.260]
It's just a joke.

[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:46.620]
Hey, I don't know.

[00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:48.960]
If I was good enough, I could go on stage now.

[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.080]
I know, that's why I said it.

[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:51.560]
Well, listen, news is coming up.

[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:52.660]
But I want to really thank you.

[00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:55.220]
I've got your letter and I wish it had continued good luck.

[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:57.580]
And I'm serious if this is, you know, if this is it.

[00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:58.960]
I'll call you tomorrow.

[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.800]
It'll be on stand show and leaving me with him

[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:02.980]
and letting out tomorrow turned out.

[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:05.780]
So you're going back tomorrow and like it lasts about an hour?

[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:10.540]
You're in the wrap for about 70 minutes.

[00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:15.200]
And the wrap is uncomfortable because it's like having pads on and everything else.

[00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:17.540]
Because you look like a football player.

[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:19.540]
But I'm saying, I feel like a hockey player.

[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:24.060]
But it's wild, but you actually can see an immediate difference.

[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:25.060]
Fantastic.

[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.540]
Okay, well listen, good luck and check in tomorrow.

[00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:28.040]
Okay.

[00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:28.720]
Thanks, Nancy.

[00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:29.480]
Bye-bye.

[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:30.340]
How do you like that?

[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:31.180]
I'll be darned.

[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:31.920]
You sure will.

[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:33.920]
There's no doubt about that.

[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.500]
The whole world would vote unanimously on that that you'll be darned.

[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.440]
Okay, Mike Wolf is back.

[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:42.400]
How about that with some more of our favorite local and area news headlines?

[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:45.520]
We're going to have CBS News at one o'clock substituting in position 2B

[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:50.460]
for the farmers insurance spot because of the boycott against the Florida Governor Martinez's tax

[00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:53.600]
or because of Neorodgers and his disgusting show, one or the other.

[00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:55.040]
And then we'll come back.

[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:56.780]
We'll come back at 106.

[00:42:57.900 --> 00:42:58.300]
Neorodgers.

[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:01.100]
Okay, one of our kind listeners, couple of our kind listeners,

[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:03.460]
sent over an emergency gift.

[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:06.560]
Vince and Mary.

[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:08.300]
And it said this worked for us.

[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:09.620]
We will now pass it on to you.

[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:10.940]
Place it on your fridge.

[00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:15.320]
Or while it works directly in front of you with best of luck, Vince and Mary.

[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:15.740]
Isn't that nice?

[00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:21.480]
And it's the Misch-Fridge Misch-Eyes Box International Calorie counter

[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:24.420]
with her picture on the front of it.

[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:25.620]
You've seen this?

[00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:25.980]
Yeah.

[00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:29.020]
Instead of...

[00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:32.480]
I was looking for something in the rack to see if we could place something.

[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:33.740]
You know, that would fit in with this perfectly.

[00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:38.920]
And I thought maybe Jeff Striker would do.

[00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:42.860]
A little bigger than life.

[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:50.740]
Oh, good feeling good when you know things are going right.

[00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:57.820]
I hope my mind and I find it as big as an outcome inside.

[00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:04.440]
Oh, good, I know, I can't wait.

[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:07.680]
I'm up to all I can now.

[00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:12.080]
And I'm a man who can't go to work.

[00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:17.820]
Be good, be good, I'm on my way.

[00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:24.800]
Be good, be good, be good, so fine, I know it's fine.

[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:33.360]
Be good, I'm sad, be good at life, family free, family night.

[00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:37.600]
Be good, feeling so fine, be good.

[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:52.400]
But I don't know if I can be me, but no more worries, no more courage, that I am free.

[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:24.780]
I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a

[00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:44.240]
man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man,

[00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:04.660]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:04.660]

[00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:04.660]

[00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:04.660]

[00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:04.660]

[00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:04.660]

[00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:04.740]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:04.740]

[00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:04.940]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:04.940]

[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:07.880]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:11.800]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:12.640]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:14.220]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:43.960]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:44.100]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:44.100]

[00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:44.100]

[00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:44.100]

[00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:44.100]

[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:44.160]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:44.160]

[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:44.160]

[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:44.160]

[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:44.160]

[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:44.160]

[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:44.160]

[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:44.160]

[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:10.760]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:13.140]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:13.140]

[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:13.140]

[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:13.260]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:13.260]

[00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:13.520]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:13.520]

[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:13.640]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:13.640]

[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:13.640]

[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:13.640]

[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:13.640]

[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:14.140]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:16.000]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:20.660]
Oh boy.

[00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:23.580]
A lot of heavy breathing in South Florida right now.

[00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:24.600]
I'll question about that.

[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:25.440]
Bigger than life.

[00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:29.520]
Jeff Strenker on 94.0 INZ.

[00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:31.600]
What number is that on our chart?

[00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:32.520]
Number on.

[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:35.480]
As in undress.

[00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:37.780]
Okay, let's go back to the calls.

[00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:40.180]
And it's just been a bubbly day here today.

[00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:42.400]
All we need a little champagne would top it off just right.

[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:42.780]
Wouldn't it?

[00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:43.680]
Something's in the air.

[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:44.880]
You bet, something is in the air.

[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:46.620]
And it's not Thundercraft Newman.

[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:48.100]
Broward County.

[00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:48.420]
Hello.

[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:49.480]
Hello.

[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:50.280]
Yes, sir.

[00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:51.020]
Who's Neil?

[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:51.520]
Yeah.

[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:52.640]
Hey, how you doing?

[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:53.680]
Great. How you doing?

[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:54.360]
Very good.

[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.340]
Listen, I wanted to ask you a question.

[00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:57.540]
Okay, ask me any of that.

[00:47:57.840 --> 00:47:58.140]
All right.

[00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:03.540]
You know those sickle and fatso's on the radio where you're not allowed to say so on and so forth.

[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:04.000]
That word.

[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:04.740]
Yeah.

[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:05.160]
Right?

[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:08.420]
So how come they are on last night on TV at Channel 39?

[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:08.980]
Yeah.

[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:10.240]
They put on this program.

[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:11.320]
I don't say the words now.

[00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:13.320]
No, but they put on this program.

[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:14.140]
That's the worker.

[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:15.560]
Right?

[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:20.400]
And over there, showing bouncing around all kinds of tips and boobs and all this stuff all over the TV.

[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:22.760]
They were bouncing around all over the TV.

[00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:23.220]
Yeah.

[00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:25.660]
Were they attached to anything or like basketballs?

[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:26.640]
Come again?

[00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:27.780]
No.

[00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:29.280]
I'll pass here.

[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:29.960]
It's really an idea.

[00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:32.240]
Well, how can they do that?

[00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:33.200]
How can they monitor?

[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:36.220]
Well, because some people are not monitoring, I guess.

[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:38.120]
They're more obsessed with what we say on the radio.

[00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:39.400]
And it, you know, why not?

[00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:42.560]
If people want to watch it fine, if they don't want to watch it, let them turn it off.

[00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:45.040]
But don't you think it's about time we grew up?

[00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:46.220]
That's true.

[00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:46.780]
Let's grow up.

[00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:48.000]
That's what the pubic wants.

[00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:49.580]
Yeah, but, you know, I can't.

[00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:52.900]
They want a little, they want to see some boobs bouncing around on their TV.

[00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:55.500]
Yeah, but 10 years ago, you wouldn't be able to see none of that.

[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:56.540]
Well, now you can.

[00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:59.260]
It's a great, they throw it on their table.

[00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:02.640]
Some of their summer activities who can't see it anywhere except on Channel 39.

[00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:03.860]
Right, Stan?

[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.520]
Okay, well, playboy channel.

[00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:06.280]
Well, okay.

[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:07.840]
That's ridiculous.

[00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:14.280]
Like on the magazines, they even cut out the ladies wearing, wearing just regular negligent

[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.100]
bras, like a skin type, wear like a skin type suit underneath it.

[00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:18.500]
You bet.

[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:19.020]
Why not?

[00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:21.400]
Before they put it on the newspaper.

[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:22.640]
What's wrong with that?

[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.580]
Well, why should they put on anything underneath it first?

[00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:29.600]
Well, the newspaper is, the newspaper is appealed to suit.

[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:34.660]
So, do you guys have too much?

[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:35.080]
I know.

[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:36.880]
Well, Annie, I've listened to you for what?

[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:39.700]
It's first time I called you because the first time I get a chance to be awful.

[00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:40.940]
All right, let me ask you a question.

[00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:43.020]
Do you think that Dave contributed to our show today?

[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:46.940]
Uh, not a role, I don't know.

[00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:48.280]
Not too much, really.

[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:51.260]
No, I didn't say a lot, but like a little, like a little.

[00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:52.540]
A little bit, okay.

[00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:53.460]
I'll give him that much.

[00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:56.780]
I hear more of the birds in the background than anybody else.

[00:49:56.820 --> 00:50:00.000]
Well, listen, you know, you start out small and then, uh, yeah.

[00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:01.940]
I'm giving the bird his chance today.

[00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:03.500]
I took over yesterday, so.

[00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:03.560]
Yeah.

[00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:05.380]
He's too much to do at last.

[00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:09.080]
I ride around with a partner, my, we drive around the trees, we're occurring in the curry.

[00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:10.060]
He's driving around the trees?

[00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:12.360]
No, under you into the bird, yeah.

[00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:14.480]
And, uh, I'm soft, wet, bro.

[00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:16.940]
Another one of our listeners who's out on a limb, so to speak.

[00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:17.180]

[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:19.400]
So, you guys are working on the laugh?

[00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:20.560]
On the what?

[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:21.320]
On the laugh?

[00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:22.280]
On the laugh.

[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:24.100]
Yeah, yeah, we work on the laugh.

[00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:27.960]
I mean, my partner doesn't particularly like the bird because every time he laughs, he said,

[00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:29.360]
what I got really sounds stupid.

[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:33.300]
On the position, that's the whole kick of the show.

[00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:35.720]
You see Neil Torch and the bird laugh.

[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:36.480]
Yeah.

[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:38.140]
He catches on quick.

[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:39.040]
Yeah, very good.

[00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:43.120]
Okay, listen, have a wonderful day and tell your partner he's a jerk, okay?

[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:46.620]
Okay, guys, man, you take your light.

[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:47.260]
See you later.

[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:52.060]
A lot of important questions that that man's mind.

[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:52.340]
Yeah.

[00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:53.980]
Well, let's go for it, huh?

[00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:56.420]
How did that line get on hold, I wonder?

[00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:56.720]
Hello?

[00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:57.300]
Hello?

[00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:58.140]
Were you on hold?

[00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:00.160]
Yes, I'm waiting to talk to Neil Rogers.

[00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:01.520]
You're speaking to him right now.

[00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:01.820]
Hi.

[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:02.760]
Isn't that exciting?

[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:03.520]
That's exciting.

[00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:06.440]
I heard you guys talking about lunch earlier today.

[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:09.060]
It was just beyond belief.

[00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:12.340]
Just wanted to let you know, you live in plantation, I understand.

[00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:12.900]
Yes.

[00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:16.860]
And I wanted to let you know what happened to a friend of mine today and myself.

[00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:19.660]
We went to a restaurant in plantation called Oliver.

[00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:20.820]
Have you ever heard of it?

[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:22.320]
Oliver's?

[00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:22.940]
Yes, it's on.

[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:23.900]
Oh, I know what it is.

[00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:26.040]
It's in a little tiny strip shopping center.

[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:26.760]
It's on sunrise?

[00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:27.240]
Yes.

[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:28.420]
And now, university.

[00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:30.420]
Well, we went there.

[00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:31.520]
We were eating lunch.

[00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:36.660]
And Oliver's, we've enjoyed Oliver for so long for eating lunch.

[00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:38.960]
And there was a bug in my friend's soup.

[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:40.780]
So we called the owner of the restaurant.

[00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:42.280]
Did they charge him for it?

[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:43.180]
Excuse me?

[00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:44.300]
Did they charge him for it?

[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:48.220]
No, we ended up having to walk out because the owner of the place was so rude.

[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:49.020]
Really?

[00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:50.500]
Oh, my God, it was terrible.

[00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:51.620]
Are you sure?

[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:53.960]
I mean, there was a bug in the soup and they were rude about it?

[00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:54.520]
Yes.

[00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:57.780]
It was called cheese broccoli soup.

[00:51:58.300 --> 00:51:59.200]
That sounds good.

[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:00.480]
It was very good.

[00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:01.200]
It was a fantastic.

[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:04.280]
Until my friend said, oh, there's a bug in my soup.

[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:06.540]
When it made me not want to eat mine either.

[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:08.620]
And we called the waitress ever and showed her.

[00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:11.120]
The waitress said, yes, that is a bug in your soup.

[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:13.840]
And the owner came over and said, no, that's not a bug.

[00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:15.360]
She said, no.

[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:17.020]
And she walked away.

[00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:18.280]
So we called the owner of her.

[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:19.960]
And we said, this is a bug in our soup.

[00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:21.100]
What do you mean, it's not a bug?

[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:22.040]
Huh?

[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:23.920]
What was it like a look-alike?

[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:25.960]
It was a little brown bug.

[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:28.320]
I mean, he was laying there on his stomach with his legs.

[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:30.000]
I mean, you could tell he was a bug.

[00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:30.340]
Yeah.

[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:31.460]
And we weren't having any-

[00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:33.300]
In the dead position, right?

[00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:34.980]
In the dead position, exactly.

[00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:41.660]
No, but I just think that people should know that this lady was just totally rude about the whole thing.

[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:43.780]
And it's really ridiculous.

[00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:44.800]
She wouldn't help us.

[00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:46.300]
She didn't offer anything she said.

[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:50.260]
She ended up saying, I'm not going to argue with you people about this and walk away.

[00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:50.960]
Oh, nice.

[00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:53.080]
Well, I guess you'll be going back tomorrow for lunch, huh?

[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:58.020]
Yeah, we're going to go back, because in my fact, I just think people should know that it's just terrible.

[00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:01.160]
The way this lady treated us and they shouldn't go to Oliver's anymore.

[00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:02.940]
Okay.

[00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:04.940]
Even though their food was all right until then.

[00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:05.400]
Yeah.

[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:11.020]
Okay, well listen, I'm not going to get into it, because you know, I don't want to get into the soup with you, but whatever you say.

[00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:11.760]
All right.

[00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:12.700]
Okay, good luck.

[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:13.060]
Thanks.

[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:14.680]
See you at Fudruckers.

[00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:18.500]
Which is another story.

[00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:19.420]
Yeah.

[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:20.980]
They stand online.

[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:21.780]
Have you ever gone there?

[00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:22.120]
Yeah.

[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:25.400]
And it didn't impress me too much now.

[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:25.680]

[00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:26.800]
First you go in to Hamburg.

[00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:31.320]
Well, not only that, but you go in and you see all that dead meat hanging in the window.

[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:31.940]
That's weird.

[00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:34.000]
Kiss me a good ass.

[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:34.180]
Boy.

[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:36.460]
Yeah, it's like driving by cemetery village.

[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:38.420]
We see all that dead meat.

[00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:39.820]
It is kind of like that.

[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:40.140]
Yeah.

[00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:41.000]
Now that you mentioned it.

[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.180]
And then you go in there and you're like, wait forever.

[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:43.760]
Yeah.

[00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:44.340]
All right.

[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:45.520]
You know, what's your name?

[00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:46.100]
Joe.

[00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:46.820]
Okay, Joe.

[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.160]
We'll call your name when it's ready.

[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:49.260]
Yeah, they call your name.

[00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:52.460]
They call out every other name in the history of the English language first.

[00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:52.740]

[00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:55.280]
In fact, I was in there.

[00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:57.640]
You're probably going to think I'm making this up.

[00:53:58.260 --> 00:53:59.340]
So this is a true story.

[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:01.120]
I was in there and they called out.

[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:03.460]
There were like five people in front of me and they called out five names.

[00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:05.260]
And I thought, well, I'm going to be next right in the state.

[00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:08.060]
They got on the little mic that they got in there.

[00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:09.360]
The speaker system.

[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:10.440]
And they said,

[00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:11.040]
They will see.

[00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:13.200]
I have to go shopping downtown for my mother.

[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:15.120]
She needs some tortillas and chili pepper.

[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:16.680]
Unbelievable.

[00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:18.460]
So that's a true story, isn't it?

[00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:18.740]
No.

[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:22.700]
Well, listen, you got to use that for something.

[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:25.800]
I haven't used that in so long since Jorge's been the quiet.

[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:28.500]
I always remind me of Pat Boone whenever I heard that.

[00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:29.640]
Yeah, I heard great bad.

[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:31.580]
Okay, I think we're going to take a break now.

[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:36.020]
And when we come back, the lines are continuing to just do a Mexican tap dance right on the phone.

[00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:37.160]
Everybody's in a great mood.

[00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:37.900]
Yeah, they really are.

[00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:39.100]
Probably because David's here.

[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:40.040]
Hey, but he's me.

[00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:40.420]

[00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:42.520]
You haven't been talking a lot, but you inspire them.

[00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:42.980]
Exactly.

[00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:44.400]
All the calls have been good.

[00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:46.920]
They know that you're here and they just light up their life.

[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:47.340]
Exactly.

[00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:51.160]
Like Debbie Boone or a sunny would say like grandma.

[00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:56.900]
19 past one at W.I. and Z will be right back to past one at W.I. and Z.

[00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:58.920]
Davis here, Mr. Sports is here also.

[00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:03.360]
And we're just talking about some of the highlights of the Atlanta Braves season this year.

[00:55:03.580 --> 00:55:04.540]
What a season it was.

[00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:05.000]
Yeah.

[00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:06.780]
I got my deal Murphy plaque.

[00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:07.320]
What do you got?

[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:14.040]
Okay, now sunny Fox said something about my saying about it yet a banana is mouth or something like that.

[00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:18.360]
Yeah, punched in in the middle of it and hear the beginning, but he was talking about you this morning.

[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:23.820]
He said something about if you say it one more time that sunny has a banana in his mouth, he'll be real happy.

[00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:26.040]
I think that's what I hope you're happy sunny.

[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:26.560]
Excellent.

[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:30.080]
Sonny's a vacationing with grandma Boone this afternoon.

[00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:31.340]
Wait, wait.

[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:32.440]
He's out there saying, Fox.

[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:32.860]
They're Fox.

[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:33.620]
Hey, why are you there?

[00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:34.540]
Fox, so why won't I?

[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:36.400]
Thank you very much.

[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:40.960]
Okay, let's take one to be great if we get sunny and Elvis Jr. do it.

[00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:41.760]
Oh, no.

[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:43.240]
I'll mumble together, baby.

[00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:44.680]
I'm real sorry.

[00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:45.920]
I didn't get to meet him Monday.

[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:46.680]
He was a good guy.

[00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:47.260]
He was a good guy.

[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:48.620]
He didn't come over and say hi.

[00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:49.540]
I'm real sorry I missed him.

[00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:50.180]
And who was he with?

[00:55:50.620 --> 00:55:51.200]
The shower lady?

[00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:52.200]
The shower lady.

[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:52.440]
Boy.

[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:54.560]
What a couple.

[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:58.280]
Boggles the mind almost.

[00:55:58.460 --> 00:56:00.140]
You're seeing Michael Jackson's hot glove me tender.

[00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:02.400]
Broward County.

[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:02.680]
Hello.

[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:03.160]
Dale.

[00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:03.840]
Yes, sir.

[00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:04.540]

[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:07.320]
I had a good time meeting all you guys the other night.

[00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:07.840]
Great.

[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.760]
Got all your autographs.

[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:12.420]
I said I go for a ride to bird, get his autograph.

[00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:15.260]
And here he's right now in a woman's bosom.

[00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:16.340]
That's true.

[00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:19.800]
Oh, I'm glad this guy called, you know, Stan, as usual,

[00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:20.640]
is so full of it.

[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:23.320]
You know that he said that we didn't write on her bosom.

[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:25.300]
He said that we signed it right in the middle of that.

[00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:28.060]
And when he was going to give his long story about how he was writing

[00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:30.140]
for a half an hour, man, I'm Tony.

[00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:33.020]
I left indelible marks on her breasts.

[00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:33.920]
Look, here and clear that.

[00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:36.880]
You know, I asked her, she said, no, it's okay.

[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:39.000]
You know, so I was writing signing it.

[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.200]
You know, I was a little hopped in the middle there,

[00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:41.520]
and you're hand slipped.

[00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:43.220]
Yeah, well, you know, it's understandable.

[00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:44.920]
But I asked her how it felt to her.

[00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:46.100]
She may have been in the middle,

[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:48.600]
because she only had one big breast in the middle of her chest

[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:51.460]
with bizarre, but anyways, she said she loved it.

[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:51.620]
Yeah.

[00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:52.740]
The bird had a still-dust alive,

[00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:54.180]
running down his mouth down there.

[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:55.240]
That was drool, sir.

[00:56:55.880 --> 00:56:56.200]
That was Danny.

[00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:56.900]
Yeah, that was Danny.

[00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:57.640]
That was Danny.

[00:56:57.640 --> 00:56:58.540]
That was Danny's over there, Brian.

[00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:00.320]
When let her go.

[00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:01.640]
Yeah, three-year-old.

[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:03.020]
Yeah, a little three-year-old.

[00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:03.440]
Two-story.

[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:04.680]
A mother in a woman.

[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:05.980]
I couldn't get near Stan.

[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:08.120]
Yeah, he kept screaming, he's painted his parents.

[00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:10.500]
Yeah.

[00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:12.100]
Stan was stripping down, he started with a jacket,

[00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:14.120]
long sleeve shirt, and then he's got the shirt off.

[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:15.340]
Then he's got the jacket off.

[00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:16.900]
And then everything said,

[00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:18.140]
you want me to take the pants off here,

[00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:19.160]
but now I'll keep those.

[00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:21.120]
Yeah, whatever you do, please.

[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:23.720]
Hey, Popped Up Park open Thursday night.

[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:24.740]
I know it tomorrow night.

[00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:25.200]
That'll be great.

[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:27.300]
All right, well, it's about it.

[00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:29.400]
I'm going to be there plunging my brains out this year.

[00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:29.860]
You watch.

[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:30.940]
Yeah, I watch.

[00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:32.700]
I watch something there last year.

[00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:33.100]
Good.

[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:35.360]
Well, listen, we all like to contribute to the breed, right?

[00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:35.720]
Yeah.

[00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:36.520]
Okay.

[00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:37.420]
Okay, thanks a lot.

[00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:37.820]
Are you ready?

[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:38.280]
All right.

[00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:39.480]
You ever been to the track day?

[00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:40.880]
Yes, several times.

[00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:41.520]
Really?

[00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:41.920]
Yes.

[00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:42.420]
Which one?

[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:43.260]
Popped Up.

[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:46.280]
Hey, Popped Up.

[00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:46.580]

[00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:46.580]

[00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:49.300]
It'll have to go sometime.

[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:50.040]
Absolutely.

[00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:52.140]
I'll show you how to lose a style.

[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:52.960]
Come on.

[00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:53.460]
You win, right?

[00:57:53.460 --> 00:57:54.000]
Do you do any good?

[00:57:54.980 --> 00:57:55.820]
I do all right.

[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:58.200]
Well, I'm with someone that knows what they're doing.

[00:57:58.320 --> 00:57:59.060]
What they're doing better than I do.

[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:00.300]
You like it?

[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:01.440]
Yeah, it's fun, yeah.

[00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:02.000]
The track, I mean.

[00:58:02.380 --> 00:58:02.560]
Yeah.

[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:05.880]
Okay, let's take a call from...

[00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:07.060]
No, seriously, that's great.

[00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:07.900]
Yeah, we'll go.

[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:08.640]
Absolutely.

[00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:09.280]
Did you hear that?

[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:09.940]
Yeah.

[00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:11.300]
They've just made a little date there.

[00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:11.800]
It's a date.

[00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:14.360]
You want to start spreading some ugly rumors now?

[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:15.920]
You want me to leave?

[00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:18.400]
Yeah.

[00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:20.240]
He's back to that again.

[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:21.120]
Do you see how he is?

[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:21.980]
He's so insecure.

[00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:22.740]
Yeah.

[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:23.720]
Let me ask you something.

[00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:25.080]
Don't you know, don't you have...

[00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:28.360]
I asked this yesterday, and I think it went over the heads of a lot of our...

[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:29.860]
Hornier callers out there.

[00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:31.640]
Don't you have friends?

[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:33.620]
Just friends who are acquaintances.

[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:34.000]
Yes.

[00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:37.320]
With whom you don't have sex and have no desire to have sex.

[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:40.140]
I have platonic female friends, many.

[00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:40.340]
Right.

[00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:41.660]
Yeah, many of that goes.

[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:42.780]
Platonic female friends.

[00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:44.280]
Yeah, she evidently dave those, too.

[00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:44.800]
Sure.

[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:48.480]
He has some, and that's Scott Ember upset, because he has these secret desires.

[00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:49.100]
Like Chrissy.

[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:49.840]
Like Chrissy.

[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.100]
Not so secret desires.

[00:58:51.260 --> 00:58:53.000]
She called yesterday, and he was just...

[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:53.860]
I want to tell you something.

[00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:55.300]
He was doing more than that.

[00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:56.060]
It was embarrassing.

[00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:56.800]
I can't tell you.

[00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:03.720]
Yeah, did you go to the Mike Spindell School of Confidence?

[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:08.740]
That's what he wants to know.

[00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:09.720]
Oh, seriously.

[00:59:10.860 --> 00:59:12.800]
I mean, you know, isn't that what life is all about?

[00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:15.460]
A variety of different kinds of relationships, right?

[00:59:16.580 --> 00:59:16.920]
Okay.

[00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:17.860]
I'm sure.

[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:18.600]
Right.

[00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:19.760]
There's all kinds.

[00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:20.620]
You bet.

[00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:21.640]
Okay.

[00:59:21.820 --> 00:59:23.180]
I wouldn't you like to have Dave as a friend?

[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:24.880]
Yeah, I think you made your point.

[00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:28.120]
I don't think any further explanation isn't necessary.

[00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:28.680]
There's a friend.

[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:29.580]
I understand.

[00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:30.800]
I get it.

[00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:31.320]
I got it.

[00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:32.880]
I think he likes me now.

[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:33.380]
Yeah.

[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:35.700]
Well, now let's not go crazy.

[00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:38.800]
Dave County, hello.

[00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:40.540]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:40.860]
Good.

[00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:41.320]
What's up?

[00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:43.060]
What's up, bro?

[00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:44.620]
You working Saturday again?

[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:45.300]
Oh, yeah.

[00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:48.420]
I heard you were not very happy on Saturday working.

[00:59:48.540 --> 00:59:51.280]
No, I've never been very happy on Saturday, but they don't give it to him.

[00:59:51.540 --> 00:59:54.840]
Well, you could take a religious holiday break if you don't keep her on Saturday.

[00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:56.560]
Oh, Saturday's you don't keep her.

[00:59:56.580 --> 00:59:56.960]
Happy the day.

[00:59:57.560 --> 00:59:58.020]
You know what?

[00:59:58.120 --> 01:00:01.060]
That's great, because that means this year it comes on a Saturday.

[01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:02.780]
Instead of on a weekday.

[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:07.660]
So all of these instant Jews around here that take off on you, you know, high holy days,

[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:09.300]
they're not going to get any extra day off.

[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:12.540]
Well, you may not have any Jewish listening audience on Saturday either.

[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:13.140]
You want to bet?

[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:15.120]
I think you just gave me my show.

[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:17.520]
I'm going to have all Jews in the first hour calling in.

[01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:19.840]
Would you like some good fill to fish?

[01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:20.140]
Please.

[01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:22.400]
And some potato lockies, too.

[01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:26.240]
Well, maybe just some grubbinus, you know, a little plate full of grubbinus.

[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:26.780]
I haven't had those.

[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:29.020]
My mother refuses to make that because it's poison.

[01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:31.900]
Well, by the time it got to be cold and rancid anyway.

[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:33.160]
Not at my mother's house.

[01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:34.660]
So I'm talking at the studio.

[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:35.040]
Yeah.

[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:36.400]
That's how we like it.

[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:37.200]
Cold and rancid.

[01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:39.780]
That's how I like grubbinus.

[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:40.760]
And that's how I like my men.

[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:41.720]
Cold and rancid.

[01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:42.040]
Right.

[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:42.860]
Bet and cacha.

[01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:43.380]
Right.

[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:44.200]
Oh, fat.

[01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:45.280]
Fat?

[01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:45.840]
Fui.

[01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:47.400]
It's like rice, isn't it?

[01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:48.780]
Not exactly.

[01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:50.300]
More like mung.

[01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:52.760]
Do you play the I-95 song anymore?

[01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:54.220]
No, we certainly do not, sir.

[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:54.900]
You got to laugh, too.

[01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:55.620]
That's correct.

[01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:56.380]
Oh, okay.

[01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:00.820]
My secretary didn't believe it because I guess I must have heard it the last time you played it.

[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:02.900]
Well, we only played it about 4,000 times.

[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:06.460]
So, you know, regardless of what they think in Portland, I think we made the impact, you know.

[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:07.860]
I know, but she never heard it.

[01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:09.020]
And she said, don't well.

[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:09.620]
Yeah.

[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:10.660]
Well, that's why it goes.

[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:11.400]
And have it.

[01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:12.080]
Have a nice day.

[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:12.680]
Well, wait a minute.

[01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:14.120]
Are you there?

[01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:14.480]
Yeah.

[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:19.180]
If she wants to send the bird a cassette, he will send her the cassette with all those goodies we've got.

[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:20.620]
And then that's on the tape.

[01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:22.960]
And then she can hear it and have it to play over and over again.

[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:23.460]
Okay.

[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:24.140]
I'll tell her that.

[01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:24.940]
That's true.

[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:25.880]
Male it to the studio.

[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:26.300]
Right.

[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:26.800]
To the bird.

[01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:27.600]
To the bird.

[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:29.720]
A 90 is best.

[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:31.080]
A 90 minute cassette.

[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:32.380]
90 minute?

[01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:32.760]
Yeah.

[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:33.320]
That's best.

[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:33.980]
Okay.

[01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:35.440]
Then he doesn't have to turn it over.

[01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:35.880]
Exactly.

[01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:37.360]
That'll be terrific.

[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:37.960]
Okay.

[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:38.400]
All right.

[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:39.000]
Have a nice day.

[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:39.660]
I'll read the urge.

[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.160]
Two, four, six, eight.

[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:42.180]
Appreciate that.

[01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:44.660]
By the way, I appreciate you having given me more to do.

[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:47.680]
I always am grateful.

[01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:52.620]
You know what this means?

[01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:54.580]
It means he'll have to bring more of his groupies in.

[01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:56.560]
He will be more interested in working there.

[01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:01.080]
He has never, ever done a moment's work since they have known him.

[01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:02.360]
Broward County.

[01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:02.660]
Hello.

[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:03.200]
Yeah.

[01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:03.880]
Dealeron, just please.

[01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:04.440]
Speaking.

[01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:05.680]
Oh, this is Ron Hutchgo.

[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:06.020]
How are you?

[01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:07.060]
Okay, Ron Hutchgo.

[01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:10.860]
You know, we're meeting some of those temptation salads sandwiches.

[01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:12.800]
They are absolutely out of this world.

[01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:13.560]
Yeah.

[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:14.320]
Yeah.

[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:14.560]

[01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:15.220]
Rodden?

[01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:15.840]
Yes.

[01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:16.580]
And no calories.

[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:17.640]
Yeah, right.

[01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:18.020]
Yeah.

[01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:18.060]
Yeah.

[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:21.020]
Especially that cheesecake with the strudel.

[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.820]
Boy, that was, was that Kyle on my right?

[01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:23.240]
Was it good?

[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:23.500]
Yeah.

[01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:24.460]
It was dietetic.

[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:25.300]
It was unbelievable.

[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:26.300]
Yeah, dietetic.

[01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:27.080]
They've made it with crab meat.

[01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:28.060]
What is that?

[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:29.200]
Oh, out of sight.

[01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:31.140]
The bacon tastes really superb.

[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:31.840]
Good.

[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:32.600]
What is it going?

[01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:33.940]
And a feeding frenzy here or what?

[01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:34.380]
Pardon?

[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:35.640]
Pardon?

[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:36.280]
Thanks, pardon.

[01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:39.900]
Well, this guy is really good.

[01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:40.140]
Oh, very, very good.

[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:42.840]
I just want to give him a little plug is what you want, right?

[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:43.720]

[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.560]
How did I pick up on that?

[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:47.420]
How do you pick up on a plug?

[01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:48.220]
Yeah.

[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:49.180]
Oh, like a...

[01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:51.460]
Well, listen, have a wonderful day, sir, but life goes on.

[01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:54.120]
You know, it's just, these people get a little carried away some of you, don't I mean?

[01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:56.200]
Well, date County, hello.

[01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:56.920]
Hey, Neil.

[01:02:57.220 --> 01:02:57.600]
Yes, sir.

[01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:59.340]
Hi, Dave and Angolvurg.

[01:02:59.480 --> 01:02:59.900]
How you all doing?

[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:00.820]
Good.

[01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:03.980]
Listen, I was down at the ice cream parlour Monday night.

[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:09.300]
And every time I walked by, I saw a fan holding a little baby in his arms.

[01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:09.720]
Yeah.

[01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:10.480]
And it's true.

[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:11.660]
You know what you guys been saying.

[01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:12.400]
You bet.

[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:14.600]
I was the one wearing the GTR T-shirt.

[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:15.560]
Oh, yeah.

[01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:17.360]
You gave me a little plug, yeah, I appreciate that.

[01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:21.680]
Yeah, we were trying to figure out who it was, but of course we don't understand why you wouldn't want to leave your name hanging around.

[01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:24.540]
I'm a fan of herment of the beans, so, you know.

[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:25.900]
Oh, my God.

[01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:27.500]
They're back.

[01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:28.180]
But anyways...

[01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:29.560]
Well, I was suddenly, I'm all choked up.

[01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:29.880]
Yeah.

[01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:31.220]
I've got one.

[01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:33.440]
You keep giving me a plug and you don't realize it.

[01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:36.120]
You keep mentioning the word, surly, right?

[01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:36.780]
Yeah.

[01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:40.180]
Well, that's my last name, except it's surly.

[01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:41.560]
But it ends with an E.

[01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:47.120]
So like next time you say surly, can you just say surly brothers nursery and you know, give me a nice...

[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:48.820]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:49.920]
I'm in a nursery business.

[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:52.560]
Oh, I'm telling you, the plug's on this show.

[01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:53.880]
It's unbelievable.

[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:56.940]
I don't sell repails, so I'm not out there the business.

[01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:57.720]
Okay, good.

[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:02.820]
It's just, you know, you're always saying surly and people mispronounce my name and then what can I tell you?

[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:03.980]
Yeah, like surly Peters.

[01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:04.820]
Yeah.

[01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:08.000]
But anyway, it's been a class.

[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:08.620]
Dave, a question?

[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:09.060]
Sure.

[01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:09.580]
Dave.

[01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:10.100]
Yes.

[01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:11.180]
Still awake over there.

[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:12.420]
Yeah, I'm just gonna...

[01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:15.060]
Not that girl calling me with the soup story, you know, with the bug.

[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:15.940]
Yeah.

[01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:17.760]
Anything like that happening in your restaurant?

[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:19.440]
No.

[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:20.900]
No way.

[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:23.540]
Why did he just say, um, ha ha ha ha.

[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:24.340]
He thought it was...

[01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:24.900]
Come on, Dave.

[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:27.180]
All right, like, how many times does the exterminator come in?

[01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:28.360]
Once a month, Dave?

[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:31.720]
Um, we've been opening a year, I haven't seen one yet.

[01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:33.420]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:34.160]
I mean, a bug.

[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:35.960]
No, he hasn't seen a bug yet.

[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:36.960]
Not the exterminator.

[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:38.120]
How about customers?

[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:38.700]
Did you see them?

[01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:40.460]
We see a few, yeah.

[01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:40.980]
Great.

[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:43.660]
Okay, well, I just wanted to talk to you because it seemed like nobody...

[01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:44.760]
Yeah, no, I want to talk to you.

[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:45.780]
I want to talk to you.

[01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:46.960]
Thank you for your...

[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:49.800]
Well, the question is, what would you do if the situation did come up?

[01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:51.960]
Well, we would give a free dinner away.

[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:52.520]
Definitely.

[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:54.640]
See, that's what their customers write.

[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:55.660]
That's the way it should be here.

[01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:58.360]
I mean, Las Vegas, you can help it if a little bug got in there.

[01:04:58.620 --> 01:04:58.840]
It's a bug.

[01:04:59.080 --> 01:04:59.080]

[01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:02.600]
Of course, it's the subtropical Hmong, yeah.

[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:03.380]
Hey, hey.

[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:04.460]
It's understandable.

[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:05.220]
Right, surly?

[01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:05.600]
Right.

[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:07.960]
Okay, I'm going to get back to work.

[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:09.080]
Okay, good luck to you.

[01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:11.240]
I'll give my best to Hermann and McQueen, too, when you say that.

[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:11.700]
Oh, exactly.

[01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:12.080]
Bye-bye.

[01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:12.380]

[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:15.580]
This is Fred Rogers of Mr. Rogers' neighborhood.

[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:18.860]
Let's take one from Broward.

[01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:19.100]
Hello.

[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:20.260]
Hi, there, I'm Neil.

[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:20.920]
This is Lisa.

[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:22.260]
I'm calling you from Broward.

[01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:22.980]
Which Lisa?

[01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:25.400]
I'm not going to call you, but...

[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:28.000]
One of the best Lisa's there is, actually.

[01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:28.980]
Why don't you say?

[01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:30.840]
I'm calling about the bug.

[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:35.060]
It seems that that young lady experienced the early bug special.

[01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:36.660]
Yeah, the early bug gets the worm, huh?

[01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:39.800]
I happened to go to that same restaurant about a week and a half ago.

[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:40.360]
Oh, boy.

[01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:40.920]
Here we go.

[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:44.100]
This kind of convinced me to call up and add my opinion.

[01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:48.940]
I had ordered a hot roast beef sandwich, and it came out and it looked really nice.

[01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:55.680]
But when I pushed the gravy aside, there was some real black meat underneath it, and it was really gross.

[01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:57.820]
We don't discuss black meat on this show.

[01:05:58.420 --> 01:05:58.940]
That's good.

[01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:00.320]
Do you want to mean something?

[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:02.400]
I wasn't about to eat it.

[01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:04.620]
You might want to call Ira Everdon Sunday morning.

[01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:06.620]
That was a lot of people.

[01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:07.420]
It's black meat.

[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:11.180]
And the waitress came over and I made a comment, and I said,

[01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:15.380]
can you ask the cook if he would serve this to his mother, and the waitress goes,

[01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:17.500]
knowing him, he probably would.

[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:21.320]
I don't know if that says there's very much for the restaurant either, but, you know,

[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:24.800]
I don't know what I would do if my father was a bug in my food.

[01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:28.760]
I mean, I'd expect a man to speak to you with some respect, but...

[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:30.740]
But he had taken advantage of it.

[01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:30.920]
Yeah.

[01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:33.220]
I don't think they got a bug problem.

[01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:34.600]
I think they've got an attitude problem.

[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:35.440]
Yeah, exactly.

[01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:37.240]
I think that's a major portion of it, you know.

[01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:37.580]
Yeah.

[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:42.200]
But I just wanted to call up the Latino, and that's about it.

[01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:42.720]
Okay.

[01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:43.480]
Thanks so much.

[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:44.080]
Thank you.

[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:44.720]
How do you say?

[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:45.680]

[01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:05.780]
Okay.

[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:08.920]
Welcome to a literate radio, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:10.740]
On W-I-N-Z.

[01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:12.660]
Am I doing...

[01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:13.620]
I'm losing order.

[01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:14.300]
Did I know?

[01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:14.660]
Hello.

[01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:15.660]
Hello.

[01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:15.660]

[01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:15.660]

[01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:15.660]

[01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:15.660]

[01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:15.660]

[01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:15.660]

[01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:15.660]

[01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:15.660]

[01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:15.660]

[01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:15.660]

[01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:15.660]

[01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:15.660]

[01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:15.660]

[01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:15.660]

[01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:15.660]

[01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:16.240]
What's it ever says?

[01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:17.260]
It makes no difference.

[01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:17.920]
They're all the same.

[01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:18.200]
Hello.

[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:19.780]
See what I mean?

[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:21.600]
Yeah, they're making a difference.

[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:22.360]
Ooh, they're bad.

[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:23.900]
Okay, I like that one.

[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:25.580]
Ooh, they're fast.

[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:26.600]
Hello.

[01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:27.560]
Hello, Neil.

[01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:28.020]
Yeah.

[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:28.940]
Oh, that's great.

[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:30.280]
I didn't have the way that long, at all.

[01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:31.640]
You bet. Well, that's an accident.

[01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:32.500]
I know it is.

[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:37.060]
Listen, I tried to call you last Wednesday, but I'm on a car, so I just couldn't hang on that long.

[01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:38.480]
I had a...

[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:39.080]
Perfector for you.

[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:40.260]
You could have mortgaged your house.

[01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:41.920]
I'm really sorry you didn't answer the phone.

[01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.120]
After seven minutes, I didn't...

[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:45.960]
Are you serious?

[01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:46.660]
I swear to God.

[01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:47.940]
Yeah, wayward sunny.

[01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:48.920]
You want to do that.

[01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:50.140]
Really?

[01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:51.900]
Well, that's waycoz.

[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:53.120]
How much did it pay, sir?

[01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:55.040]
Well, it was 1480, but for two bucks.

[01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:56.040]
And I was...

[01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:56.640]
It was cold.

[01:07:56.820 --> 01:07:57.420]
You couldn't beat it.

[01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:59.000]
You know, wayward sunny loves the mud.

[01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:02.740]
And both of you was right there the whole wayward, so...

[01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:03.260]
It was...

[01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:04.200]
It was coming down the street.

[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:04.920]
You couldn't lose.

[01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:07.380]
But that's what I was going to say.

[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:08.940]
Just go back to the old form.

[01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:11.220]
Now, I want to give you these winters, but you know,

[01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:12.660]
it just can't hold on all the time.

[01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:13.100]
I know.

[01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:14.420]
But your intentions were good.

[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:14.780]
Exactly.

[01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:17.760]
Listen, I'm saving all my money for Pompano.

[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:18.840]
Oh, are you...

[01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:20.220]
Oh, that's ridiculous Pompano.

[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:21.300]
I hate that.

[01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:23.200]
What do you mean you hate that?

[01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:24.280]
What does that mean?

[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:24.980]
You hate that.

[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:26.740]
I can't stand those trotters.

[01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:27.320]
Why not?

[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:28.700]
I just think it's ridiculous.

[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:30.060]
I want a good flat.

[01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:32.160]
Give me the flat any day.

[01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:33.660]
Okay, where's your car park?

[01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:34.900]
We'll give you a fourth flat.

[01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:35.500]
How's that?

[01:08:35.980 --> 01:08:36.920]
Thanks a lot, Neil.

[01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:38.420]
Hey, listen, you want to hear something?

[01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:41.000]
Don't you know that harness racing is my life

[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.460]

[01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:44.280]
Are you cereal?

[01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:44.980]
You bet.

[01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:45.780]
My God.

[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:49.060]
That's my life, my blood and soul and guts.

[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:51.060]
Jesus, I just can't...

[01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:52.200]
No, not Jesus, Neil.

[01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:53.100]
I can't hold on it, Neil.

[01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:54.740]
Now, don't fight to that line.

[01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:55.220]
No, no.

[01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:56.640]
Hey, listen, Neil.

[01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:59.140]
Stirl Brothers Nursery is not funny.

[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:00.380]
I want other customers.

[01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:02.160]
And you always mention my name, too.

[01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:03.500]

[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:13.560]
And this is true that you were all at Bryant House at seven o'clock AM

[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.380]
singing the song, Boys, One, Sex in the Morning.

[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:17.660]
Oh, isn't that cute?

[01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:19.360]
No, it's just an ugly rumors, sir.

[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:20.500]
Just an ugly rumor.

[01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:22.060]
I was at Dave's house, et cetera.

[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:23.780]
Oh, I was thinking, Boys, One, Sex.

[01:09:23.780 --> 01:09:26.280]
Because he was at Cindy's house singing the same thing.

[01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:27.620]
Cindy?

[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:28.220]

[01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:28.900]

[01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:29.780]
Yes, Chrissy's house.

[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:30.380]

If he's anything like Chrissy, snow, I'll tell you.

[01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:35.540]
And you know the incredible part of it is nothing is happening all the way around.

[01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:36.320]
So don't forget it.

[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:36.960]
Don't worry about it.

[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:38.400]
I'll tell you lies all over town.

[01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:38.940]

23 minutes before too at WINZ.

[01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:47.940]
The problem is we ate too much, you know?

[01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:48.680]
Again?

[01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:49.460]
Didn't we?

[01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:54.260]

[01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:05.780]
Well.

[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:06.520]
Well.

[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:09.080]
Well.

[01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:09.140]

[01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:09.140]

[01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:09.140]

[01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:09.140]

[01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:09.140]

[01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:09.540]
Well.

[01:21:09.580 --> 01:21:09.580]

[01:21:09.580 --> 01:21:09.580]

[01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:09.960]
Well.

[01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:10.340]
Well.

[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:10.720]

[01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:11.160]

[01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:11.160]

[01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:11.160]

[01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:11.160]

[01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:11.160]

[01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:11.160]

[01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:11.160]

[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:11.440]

[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:11.440]

[01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:13.020]
Well.

[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:16.040]
Well.

[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:17.160]
Well.

[01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:17.600]
Well.

[01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:18.320]
Well.

[01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:18.940]
Well.

[01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:27.060]
Well.

[01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:30.700]
Well.

[01:21:31.700 --> 01:21:32.300]
Well.

[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:34.120]
Well.

[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:34.120]

[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:34.120]

[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:34.120]

[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:34.120]

[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:34.120]

[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:34.120]

[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:34.420]
It's a challenge.

[01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:34.420]

[01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:34.420]

[01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:34.420]

[01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:34.500]
Where is it?

[01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:35.940]
It's not a great idea.

[01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:36.720]
It's a challenge.

[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:37.400]
Well.

[01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:37.520]
Well.

[01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:37.900]

[01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:38.000]
It's a challenge.

[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:38.720]
Well.

[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:38.720]

[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:38.720]

[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:39.580]
For sure.

[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:41.080]

[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:48.920]
Well.

[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:50.920]
I have a great idea.

[01:21:58.760 --> 01:21:58.840]
Well.

[01:21:58.840 --> 01:21:59.100]
Well.

[01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:00.900]
Thanks, Lodge. You'll do some surprising.

[01:22:17.380 --> 01:22:19.960]
Oh, yeah him too.

[01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:22.340]
Okay, six before two.

[01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:24.420]
It didn't hear what I did yesterday. Did you?

[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:25.500]
Nobody else did.

[01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:27.020]
You called Jean Cashman on Zeta.

[01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:27.700]
Yes, I did.

[01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:29.720]
You heard that. I heard that. Did you hear the second call?

[01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:31.840]
I monitored your show. Did you hear the second call?

[01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:34.960]
No. This is what you would have fallen out of the car.

[01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:38.820]
I called her up on playing a dire straits and walk of life.

[01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:41.160]
I said, hey Jean, wait a minute now. This is fun.

[01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:43.920]
Hey Jean, what are you playing in? She's saying, what are you playing?

[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:45.700]
And I said, dire straits, walk of life.

[01:22:45.940 --> 01:22:48.100]
I said, what are you playing, Jean? And there's this long pause.

[01:22:48.100 --> 01:22:50.080]
And she said, the doors.

[01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:58.320]
I said, okay Jean, see you later.

[01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:02.840]
Oh, really? The doors.

[01:23:03.180 --> 01:23:04.260]
I'm sure it was a coincidence.

[01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:07.400]
Oh, yeah. Well, I mean, you know, call them every 10 minutes.

[01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:09.120]
Did that come as a great surprise to you?

[01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:11.940]
Yeah, they weren't playing CCR. That was a surprise.

[01:23:11.940 --> 01:23:13.360]
You make her call me on the phone.

[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:16.080]
Pink Floyd Sunday night. May 17th.

[01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:19.680]
Two months had passed.

[01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:23.580]
He said, Jerry, I want to ask you to hand the ministry back to me.

[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:28.900]
As you promised in Palm Springs on March 17th.

[01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:33.300]
I said, Jim, assuming it was being taped or someone might be listening in and it was for the record.

[01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:36.500]
I said, Jim, here's what I want to say to you.

[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:40.100]
From ultimaltum ultimaltum, I'm not just me, babe.

[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:43.140]
It was funny the first 100 times.

[01:23:43.140 --> 01:23:44.480]
I am afraid.

[01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:49.260]
What was that from the day I was born?

[01:23:50.940 --> 01:23:53.720]
I told you tell me what you did.

[01:23:54.180 --> 01:23:57.860]
What was that from the day you came?

[01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:03.620]
So I'm going to love you.

[01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:12.720]
If the service is new to us, it's going to fly out to Amos Hotel in California to do a fair, right?

[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:20.660]
Brian, Jerry Fowell came, Roy Grutman, his attorney, Gary Nimm, and Martin DeMont, the people that are all American.

[01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:21.740]
I've been seen on the air.

[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:22.240]
Wow.

[01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:29.380]
People actually came to our home, I believe, with a plan in their hearts and minds to take over PCL.

[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:33.180]
You know, they came to say that they were saving PCL for us.

[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:35.580]
They were not there to save PCL.

[01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:36.720]
They came as our saviour.

[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:42.700]
And Jim, the reason I say this is because you had always your prayer that always did.

[01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:44.880]
And that someday the minute you could work together.

[01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:46.460]
And that week was the one.

[01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:54.400]
And we thought it was so kind of Jerry Fowell who offered to help a penny possible to nominate you.

[01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:59.180]
And I want to make it clear today and we're talking more about it tomorrow, but we did not give the minute straight.

[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:00.900]
Sure you did, Jimmy.

[01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:01.400]
Sure you did.

[01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:02.520]
Not for you to pay.

[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:03.040]
Sure you did.

[01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:03.600]
Come on, Tammy.

[01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:04.460]
That's up.

[01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:06.060]
That's up, Tammy.

[01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:07.220]
Sure you did.

[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:08.600]
Come on, Jim.

[01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:10.480]
Jim, Tammy, don't do that.

[01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:10.920]
Tammy.

[01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:16.000]
Well ladies and gentlemen, that's going to conclude our ministry for this afternoon.

[01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:20.380]
And Dave is going to help you to call spring.

[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:22.660]
Now do you have any final comments about these two days?

[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:24.400]
It's been unbelievable.

[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:27.260]
Two days that will live in infamy, right?

[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:28.740]
Yes, infamy.

[01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:29.820]
And the food?

[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:31.060]
Excellent.

[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:31.720]
Yeah.

[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:33.160]
We took good care of you, right?

[01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:33.840]
Yeah, you're great.

[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:35.460]
I know it's great here.

[01:25:35.660 --> 01:25:36.040]
You're great.

[01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:39.340]
Friday night will be at the melting pot and will all be great.

[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:39.820]
Yeah.

[01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:40.420]
Together.

[01:25:40.700 --> 01:25:43.220]
We're going to open some bottles of champagne and I celebrate the year.

[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:43.660]
Right.

[01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:47.600]
Flatten you down there on the table with that chocolate fondue and it will be a nice to remember.

[01:25:47.980 --> 01:25:48.640]
Thank you.

[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:49.320]
And for this right afternoon.

[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:50.880]
Thank you, Neil.

[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:51.620]
Okay.

[01:25:52.100 --> 01:25:53.800]
Thank you, Mr. Sport.

[01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:57.180]
Thanks a lot for being Glenn.

[01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:59.820]
And thank you Stan for being Stan.

[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:01.700]
For being a dirty old man.

[01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:04.880]
Okay, that's going to do it.

[01:26:04.900 --> 01:26:05.620]
I can't believe this.

[01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:06.800]
This is actually okay.

[01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:07.680]

[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:11.720]
I'm going to go to the next one.

[01:26:12.100 --> 01:26:13.020]
I'm going to go to the next one.

[01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:13.020]

[01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:13.020]

[01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:13.680]
I'm going to go to the next one.

[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:18.840]
I'm going to go to the next one.

[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:19.680]
I'm going to go to the next one.

[01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:21.420]
I'm going to go to the next one.

[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:22.180]
I'm going to go to the next one.

[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:22.800]
I'm going to go to the next one.

[01:26:22.860 --> 01:26:25.260]
I'm going to go to the next one.

[01:26:25.260 --> 01:26:26.340]
I'm going to go to the next one.

[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:27.160]
I'm going to go to the next one.

[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:28.860]
I'm going to go to the next one.

[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:29.740]
I'm going to go to the next one.

[01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:31.060]
I'm going to go to the next one.

[01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:32.120]
I'm going to go to the next one.

[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:33.040]
I'm going to go to the next one.

[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:33.020]

[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:33.020]

[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:33.020]

[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:33.020]

[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:33.020]

[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:33.020]

[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:33.020]

[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:33.020]

[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:33.020]

[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:33.020]

[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:33.020]

[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:33.020]

[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:33.020]

[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:33.020]

[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:33.020]

[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:33.020]

[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:33.020]

[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:33.020]
