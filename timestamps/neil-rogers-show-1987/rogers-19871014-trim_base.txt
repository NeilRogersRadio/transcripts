[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120]
Oh, we're sorry. You must first take off your pants and squeal like a pig before dialing this number.

[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:21.800]
Please hang up and dial again. I said, please hang up and dial again. Please hang up and dial again. Now, you're being bad. Please hang up and dial again.

[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:50.820]
I'm just obsessed. You know me. You know how I get into these things. We're probably wouldn't even be hearing joy again after that. I'm just obsessed with that piece. I don't think it's going to take a place at joy. You don't think so? Okay. Let's take one from date. Hello.

[00:00:50.820 --> 00:01:04.560]
Yes. Good morning, Mr. Rogers. Please. Yes, speaking. How are you? I have to say that I've never had the opportunity of listening to you on the AM before, but my husband has. Yes. And says that we come home in the evenings. Say, boy, you should have heard what Neil Rogers said today.

[00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:19.080]
And so I have been a Zeta listener for as long as I can remember. Right. And when they told us that Neil Rogers is going to come on, I was so anxious. I could not wait. Are you still anxious? Well, not really. I have to say that I was kind of disappointed.

[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:28.580]
And I turned the station to another station. Unfortunately, I'm now listening to another radio station. What's what? I turned Zeta back on. What's what are you listening to right now?

[00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:41.440]
I need motivational music in the morning. Oh, good. I get up at six and work till noon. So I need some of that motivated stuff. Yeah, this sounds like that. Other ladies says we've got to hear music in the morning.

[00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:51.880]
Yes, but I'm going to say that this morning when I turned you on and I heard the Spanish. Yeah, it's really got me cracked up. Now I'm back to listening to you and you are very good.

[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.820]
Another one. We weren't getting asked today. I just can't wait to turn on later for a week. Isn't that something?

[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.700]
Boy, circle right there. A captain Dave takes all the credit for that. I said Captain Dave gets all the credit for that. I really do enjoy.

[00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.680]
Sure beats those others. Really great. Wow. Thank you so much. You all have a good day. You all have one too.

[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:23.020]
Oh, boy, fickle or what? We stuck yesterday, but they were great. Yeah. What are we doing different today?

[00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:38.360]
Estosio and. Oh, yeah. True. 10 minutes after eight. And let's take another call here from Rowered County. Good morning. Hello, Neil. Hello. Jack Nick was on here. Jack Jack.

[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:48.680]
I've been the catch my movie last night. Little bits and pieces, Jack. Little bits and pieces. Yeah, like the one they left on the floor. The pieces of nurse ranch in right.

[00:02:50.420 --> 00:03:06.220]
Yeah, used to be right. How's the chief doing? The chief. They're pretty good. They're there next to me. He's not talking. You know, one of the best scenes in a movie is whether getting ready to go in for shock therapy.

[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:32.840]
No, not yet. Don't knock it to you. Try it. You have. Absolutely. Look at that. He just puts a head. It's on his phone five this morning. Seriously, they're sitting outside the room and he offers him a piece of gum. Yeah. And the chief says, thank you. Thank you. Yeah. And he looks at him. My new movie. Oh, yeah, that's great. My favorite, Jack.

[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:46.080]
My wife's working. I'm out looking for. I mean, I have a fact I did find a few good parents. I bet you did. Yeah.

[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:54.680]
Well, listen, Jack, it's great here from here. And it's too bad they had to clean up your act last night. But you know, one of these days it'll be back on the cable. We can all look good words.

[00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:06.700]
Neil, can I ask you one little favor? What's that, Jack? I'd love to hear that piece of commercial with you and Glenn. Oh, that may be coming. That may be coming up. It's the only commercial in the history of radio that gets requests.

[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:20.200]
Oh, when you're good, you know, you can say that again. Okay, Jack. We'll see you around the range. You too. That's true. Well, you'll never guess who's online one now. Oh, this is going to get Eric very upset. Hello.

[00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:31.060]
Hello, Neil. Yes. Deep throat. Yeah, see what I said. Very upset. If I went through all the dials, I finally found you. Okay. I hope you got some good material today.

[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:43.540]
Throat. I said, I hope your material has improved since last week. Just said that. Yeah. Let me say it again. Listen, you guys sound great today. It's back to the normal, the normal show. The first couple days.

[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:57.180]
Like I think when thought he was Roger or ski playing with you know, for him against the Eagles, you know, I kind of have them. Yeah, now everyone seems to calm down. The pregnant pauses of what makes your show don't listen to anybody else about the morning drive while he does look a little.

[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:13.060]
He does look a little like a scam, but that's another story. Yeah. I just wanted to tell. Um, lead you left. He's unfamiliar with Jeff Striker. The difference between Jeff Striker and other men is most men carry a condom in their wallet.

[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:29.240]
Jeff carries a wallet in his condom. You guys really do sound good. And I'm listening. I'm up at six o'clock. Your line goes off. I wake up to you except for the six seconds the other day when no one had a mic on. Yeah, let me ask you this question. Are we narrow or wide on your radio?

[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:42.020]
Well, uh, it depends on which way I face the radio. Yeah. Good thinking away from me. You're narrow. Okay. You sound great. Really? Thank you. Bye bye. Take care of yourself. Well, he was on his best behavior now. I'm to thank you. He was good.

[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:48.440]
Good time for the good time for the good time for the great. Rate rate rate rate rate rate rate rate rate.

[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:56.960]
Trying for the great rate rate. Good time for the good time for the great rate rate rate rate rate rate rate rate rate rate rate.

[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.940]
All right. We were unfair to our AM colleagues. By the way, even though they could scare the crap out of the whole time,

[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:08.760]
we were unfair last couple of days. And we've been picking on poor Arlene Ross, who is a superstar in her own mind.

[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.740]
and you know today is the third day just like he just said about this show the first couple of days

[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.900]
It's gonna be a little rocky and not that comfortable you try to figure out what the hell's wrong with all this damn ancient equipment in here

[00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.920]
Of course and now we figured it out and we're used to it right?

[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.020]
It doesn't any better but we're used to it so we figured that this morning I came in early and I taped a little bit right at

[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:33.180]
530 of Arlene's newscast with Mike Wolf and I thought we'd give him another chance right good to redeem themselves

[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.540]
Okay, we'll try one more

[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.400]
and I was when

[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.320]
Terry

[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.320]
Right now the program director is having a heavy

[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.800]
Okay, so the fourth day is a charm trust me

[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.380]
Oh

[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:09.420]
815 on Zeta 4 and you know what can I say they're just having a good time up there. We're having a good time back here right sure

[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.300]
That's why Gary's here at 8 o'clock in the morning. I

[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.120]
New there had to be a reason. I think those people were from an employment service. Yeah, by the way

[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.360]
Some of those illegal aliens who came in you notice there's more stuff going out of the building

[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:27.780]
The carpeting is coming in the fronter. It's like a diversion in the back door. There's like equipment going out and all kinds of good stuff

[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.420]
Okay, let's take another call here from

[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:35.400]
Bulk by the way is open in case you get a fast busy. That's the way we had no mobile colors again today

[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.640]
You know what I don't want Max to get upset because I know he's hovering in there

[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.400]
But we are gonna have to replace these lines aren't we are we gonna have to get some real thought you know

[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.680]
It's just you know you can prolong it as long as you like like another couple of days till we walk down

[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:55.320]
But sooner or later you're gonna have to get some real numbers and some real lines and like what do we got one two like couple extra lines on it right

[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.120]
Stan warned you about the 550 exchange

[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:03.020]
Well, we haven't had any problem in Dayton Brown that's because there are enough people calling from enough different places

[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.680]
Mm-hmm. Oh, he's listening on delay. Well

[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.880]
I'll tell you what we'll start listening on delay is that confusing to you

[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.420]
I'll be honest with you that's better

[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:17.380]
It's a little confusing at first are you are you can you keep up with?

[00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:18.860]
Okay, how's that?

[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:19.820]
I

[00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:25.600]
Went into a time war I enjoyed that you can't you can't relate to that in other words

[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.460]
You can't you can't walk and chew gum at the same time

[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:35.880]
You're gonna do that again. Just one more time you see if you if you just keep going and you don't pay any attention that you can

[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:41.160]
Hear how good you sound now now you're back to this oh boy. I like that my head

[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:48.320]
You can't do that to me. Okay, let's take I'm just getting even Broward County good morning. Welcome to Zeta

[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:56.220]
Okay, here's not see there a few of these people who actually are a am listeners and know what the hell we're talking about that's great

[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.460]
A certain number of

[00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.580]
No, no, no, it's matter of fact if you don't like the music we will delete the one from this hour

[00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:10.280]
Because it's a heart and who will you run doing it? You know we can live without that

[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.620]
Yeah, I'm sort of I think it's ridiculous after all your talks

[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:18.120]
Why would they make if someone wants to listen to me? No, wait a minute. They're not making me play it

[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.540]
But don't you know that on the A and show last several months we've been played a little music in there

[00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:26.960]
Yeah, well fun song. No, we also played every now and then something serious sure

[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:34.600]
Come on, I just thought they were making you do it. No, they don't make me do anything. Okay, that's good

[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:40.680]
Well anyway, I'm glad to have you early in the morning when I go to work and you'd be leaving now

[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:47.300]
But you are happy though, right? Yeah, yeah, we don't we don't sound narrow on the radio and it's not buzzing and you don't have any problems, right?

[00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:54.140]
Excellent our kind of caller. Okay. Thanks a lot. Okay. It's 818 on Zeta only a minute ago

[00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:57.520]
It seemed like it was 817. It will take one from date County next good morning

[00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.940]
Good morning. Neil. Hey, how are you? Okay?

[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.520]
I was wondering that Jeff strike as long as that

[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.680]
Vellabona record or that

[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.680]
So yeah, CD on she D

[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:14.000]
No, actually it's from the soundtrack of bigger than life, which I think is on channel six tonight

[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.480]
33. Yeah, one of those

[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.500]
Okay, yeah, I was interested in buying it like it's fine. I bet you are

[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:26.920]
What's the name Lee sounds pretty good at least he puts his up the show a little bit. Yeah, that's why he's here, you know

[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.100]
Viewer discretion is it

[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:30.480]
Yeah

[00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:38.160]
Let's do for a long time man. How come we let that go did you notice we just

[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.840]
That's all right FM. It's okay. Is that it?

[00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:46.720]
Okay, thanks a lot. Okay, don't ever say that disgusting word again

[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:53.060]
That would have been dumped on a bird wouldn't it? No, you wouldn't have done it on a my show. Okay. All right. Just curious

[00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:54.480]
What do you say

[00:10:54.480 --> 00:11:00.180]
I missed it. Oh, you see he didn't hear what he said. I heard I'll tell you later

[00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:02.720]
Right it down

[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.520]
Can you spell it glad?

[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.540]
Oh, I see

[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:13.060]
So it's what I heard

[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.880]
Like listening

[00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.440]
See we're listening like

[00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:18.340]
After

[00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:25.640]
I know I like this life goes that for a second. Does that aggravate you well? I go back in life

[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:31.840]
I aggravates you I'm gonna keep doing it. Well, I tell you I love it anything we can do to make your life worth a dime or less

[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.400]
Is good with me. Okay, let's get serious now. Let's put you up a little bit

[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:45.380]
Oh those levels I love it. I wanted to wake Lee up a little bit. Okay, cleared my sinuses. Yeah, my wax is all out of my ears now

[00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.220]
I appreciate that oh

[00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.780]
Oh, no, this is not better watch it or I'm gonna put you back on delay

[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.920]
You'll be sorry what a threat. Yeah

[00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:02.940]
Hey get those headlamps. Is this this work or does because I don't recall any other than the call we made a max to wake him up yesterday

[00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:07.640]
No, it's busy fast busy not a fast busy

[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:11.300]
I think that was a slow busy medium

[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:16.880]
Oh

[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:23.180]
One more try it's worth it. Come on. Hey, well, you know what? Probably we'll work if I down a right number

[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.120]
Well, you know, it's worth a try worth a try

[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.740]
This is one of these 976 numbers. No 900

[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.360]
Well, see that's where you're supposed to put your lungs since access code in when it makes that noise

[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:43.720]
See he

[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:46.980]
Ha ha ha

[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:52.920]
We're into your dialing instructions or ask your in-house operator first assistant. This is a recording

[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:54.640]
7104

[00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.660]
Yeah, same to you

[00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:59.160]
Those numbers at the best game today

[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:08.260]
Wait a minute look at that J has got is that a lot a lemon jacket that he's wearing? Yes

[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:12.020]
You can tell he's been in the Florida too long can't you? We're in a lemon jacket

[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:17.440]
But you like when you go into shopping while you see these old guys wearing the lime green pants and your lemon jacket

[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:23.060]
Oh boy, it's really something and it of course the blue cap that's part of you in a forum. Oh, yeah

[00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:25.860]
The little blue cap like Jimmy Hummel with his green cap

[00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:31.300]
So you see what I mean max give rid of these folks we can't dial out we can't have any fun in here. We can't do a damn thing, you know

[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:37.200]
I mean, that's so great. He's got a new clock. He fixed a pot here. What was it and put music on hold?

[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:43.840]
It steps in the right direction. Yeah, but we need more a lot more like to be able to hear ourselves

[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:48.000]
You know or like maybe just

[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:54.000]
It's better. I'm telling you if we could hear ourselves sounding like that

[00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.540]
Prede-lay. Yeah, imagine how good the show could be. This sounds great when we hear the delay doesn't it?

[00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:04.240]
Is it just our match now? Listen to it like that or I could just leave dead air but I

[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.560]
Yeah, it really sounds fantastic. Oh god

[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:13.840]
And it's not narrow either in here. It's wide. It's like spacious

[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.300]
Plains and whatever whatever. Yeah, okay

[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:21.380]
27 past eight on Zeta 4 our number is 550 down

[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.060]
Sorry 550 9490

[00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:35.220]
Just in case and the book of line is available just in case you don't get a fast busy

[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:40.920]
And if you're on a mobile phone don't even try it because you're gonna get a fast busy, okay? Just a little advice

[00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:44.720]
Broward good morning. Good morning. How you doing great. How what's up? Oh?

[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:47.380]
I'm doing fine. Listen a couple of things here real quick

[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:53.680]
One I have to agree with a guy that says it's sort of crazy trying to listen to the delay and the other because I've been doing that now for five minutes

[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:59.940]
That I've been on hold and it is a little nut. Yeah, the other kneel is I'm generally a music person on the FM dial and all that

[00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:03.080]
And I just have enjoyed the show a little more than I expected

[00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:06.420]
Let me throw one idea at you if you want to sort of combine

[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:11.140]
Your style with putting out a little music go for the songs that are sort of

[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:16.860]
Messages or whatever along the way like XTC maybe I don't know just crazy things

[00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:22.980]
Harry Nielsen son of schmielsen's got a couple of three you can pull off of there that I'm sure haven't gotten my care play anywhere

[00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:29.560]
And just a little like I say political songs or whatever the ones with it with more messages and music now

[00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:35.140]
And just how to culture as they say in the winds caffit terria

[00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:36.780]
countercoach

[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:43.320]
And I asked one quick question go ahead just out of career. You offered you ask a lot of people there. I'm 34

[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:47.360]
You might tell me not how old you are me. Yeah, I'm 44

[00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:55.020]
That's not that far off that. Yeah, I'm not that old. Not like Joey. Oh, god like 74. Yeah

[00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:00.960]
I was just sort of curious because I've noticed that there's certain hard rock music that you do like and some that you don't

[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:06.960]
So I was just trying to figure out where the dividing line. No, no, I like good music. Okay, right? I understand now like

[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.820]
Some of these groups that are one meant to get Lee upset

[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:15.200]
But some of the groups are they just suck is the bottom line. Okay. I like most of the music we're playing

[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:22.300]
Oh, yeah, but like I said, I just there was a couple things you'd pan that I don't know if you were really serious about panning them or not like what like what

[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:27.640]
Oh, what was it? Zeppelin or something that you said no, I like Led Zeppelin. Okay, there was somebody

[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:31.020]
I forget who it was but someone that I thought was decent that when you said that was the last time

[00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:33.140]
Maybe you get in play or whatever on your show

[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:38.800]
Pink Floyd. No, Pink Floyd's okay. It's just a joke with our program. Our program director is obsessed with Pink Floyd

[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:42.460]
In fact, we got we got money coming up in a couple of minutes by Pink Floyd

[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:48.840]
With the word it with the word yeah, but it's still a good song

[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.320]
What was the group that I was ripping last hour?

[00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:54.440]
Steely, oh, yeah, steely denna they suck, okay?

[00:16:55.540 --> 00:17:00.340]
Oh, you get a lot of people hot with that. Oh, that terrible. Oh, the worst

[00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:06.380]
I was gonna enjoy your show. I have a very conservative friend that listens all day long to nothing but the talk shows

[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:13.500]
I told him that you were coming on. It was like oh, I like I said he's rather conservative and as soon as he told me you weren't his favorite

[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:16.360]
I figured you would be decent for me to listen. Yeah, what is he a Nazi?

[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:23.140]
No, no, no, he's just like I said he just rather conservative. He's very Republican. Oh, yeah, like I said

[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:29.160]
No, no, wait a minute before you write the letters not all Republicans are Nazis, okay? Most of them but not all

[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:36.020]
Yeah, and what's his favorite talk show host? I don't know who his favorite

[00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:36.980]
We

[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.880]
I've always heard of a boy to talk show

[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.460]
Death got a camera one let's say

[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.660]
So you like steely denna?

[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:49.440]
Not so much that I'm not a favorite you know, I just that would look into their music. Yeah, yeah

[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.920]
Let me ask you about a record. I'm a man by Chicago

[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:54.440]
Never heard of it right?

[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.640]
Not by Chicago. No, see I told you I never heard of it either

[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:04.220]
Everybody here is like oh you're no either about music you ever you know, and I'm sure I've got it because I got all our albums

[00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:10.720]
But it's an obscure cut. Yeah, and these people are always a big a. O. R. Head. It was a big E. O. R. Head end of the road, okay?

[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:18.620]
These people and these a O R station to think you got to play obscure cuts that nobody ever heard of before

[00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:23.760]
And that's why they got like fractional shares of the audience because nobody understands the music

[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.120]
What are you laughing about it's true?

[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.600]
Of course, okay, I've got the album here

[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.880]
Yeah, sure play take 54. I mean, that's the heck you know, sure

[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.860]
That's if you can't come down that hard right after we play Frank Zappo, okay

[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:44.980]
No, I should I can go along with not liking Zappo

[00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:49.740]
I used to like his music and all of that but I heard him do an interview on another station about 10 years ago

[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:54.620]
Yeah, and he has such a holier than thou attitude it really well. He is probably he is holier than we are

[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.700]
Yep, according to him. He is that's why his daughter's name is moon. Yeah, right?

[00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:04.100]
Okay, well listen. I guess I should let you guys get back to it. Yeah, let's get back to the show, okay?

[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:09.140]
Yeah, right have a good one. Okay, and don't forget one thing. What's that? Steely Dan sucks, okay? Okay? Okay?

[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:13.740]
832 and say to four that probably got a lot of the music intensive listeners very upset

[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:15.840]
We are not music intensive on a show

[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:20.220]
We have no intention of being music intensive and we play a record when we feel like it, you know

[00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:25.720]
This hour we're gonna skip it because that lady had a point. Mm-hmm. We play it when we feel like it, right? Exactly

[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.780]
Right, what's wrong with that? Right

[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:33.700]
If you want to hear tons of music turn on GTR, you know herman and McVeena got them out of the ocean somewhere

[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:37.720]
They were hanging out for a couple of months. They put them back on here and they said these guys suck

[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.740]
So don't let them say anything. You know play a lot of music. Well, they were correct

[00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.480]
They were correct in both cases

[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:47.860]
So if you want to hear lots of music all on compact disc and that's another bunch of crap

[00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.860]
Okay, I don't want Peter to get upset when you're listening to your radio

[00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:53.900]
I've got a great stereo in my car and I got a good stereo in the house

[00:19:53.900 --> 00:20:01.580]
I don't care whether it's on CD whether it's off a record and Edison cylinder a cassette a cartridge if it sounds good

[00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:06.080]
You can't tell like that crap we played by the stones last hour came others a little helper

[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:10.600]
That sounded like it was coming off of a waxed Edison cylinder and it was on a compact disc

[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:13.100]
Big deal, right? I'm on impressed

[00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.140]
Are you impressed? No

[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.000]
Are you impressed? Absolutely not

[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.600]
No, it's no difference. It really isn't after it goes through all the processing and all that it all sounds the same

[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.260]
Yeah on radio. Yeah, it's just shock

[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:28.080]
Radio

[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:32.680]
Can we do the radio highlights quickly before mr sports? No, let's save him for after mr sports

[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:36.680]
You always got to hold him a little something back. Okay. Okay. That's they're good today and in your case

[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.380]
Oh, you've got a little intro for mr

[00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:44.620]
Dozeta for mr sports is brought to you by Carlsburg and Carlsburg light beer

[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:50.960]
St. Louis Cardinals in the San Francisco Giants will decide the National League pennant tonight when I meet at Bush Stadium in St. Louis

[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:56.340]
Now listen, I want you to listen the audience very carefully and in those of you who are calling in

[00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:59.740]
You're gonna be on the spot. I want you to listen to a little music here

[00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.360]
There's this on compact disc

[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:08.000]
cassette

[00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:13.420]
The scratches is it the record? Is it off cartridge?

[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:16.740]
I'll play it with our

[00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:20.380]
thumbnail

[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:22.680]
You

[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:25.600]
See, I'm just doing this as a demonstration. I still didn't want to step on it

[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:33.840]
Good record to Woodstock she she we're not playing good stuff like this, huh little to counter culture

[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.640]
Crossby stills an axe little to recognizable so when you call in

[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.940]
If you want to tell us if there was on CD a little more maybe here we go

[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:48.940]
Okay, that's enough. It's all you get no prizes by the way. They're not giving us anything big yet

[00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:53.400]
Not yet, but boy any second you can't hear the um, yeah, I could hear it the RF

[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.220]
Is that early in the mic just shut up a minute event all right

[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:04.660]
Is that incredible or why yeah, yeah, why RF what a technical disaster this is isn't

[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:12.740]
pathetic well, I like RF do you good? Okay, let's go back to a brown County and say good morning good morning

[00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:16.280]
I got one question. Yeah, what happens a morning radio? Oh

[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:22.440]
It's you don't even hear the mic you don't hear the music anymore. I like the old breakfast club on Zeta. Oh good

[00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:25.040]
You're let's see what's his number two

[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:28.800]
You mean number two you're the second one. I like the old breakfast club on Zeta

[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:38.460]
Well, this is not a me this is not a music show sir. Can you understand that there are 8 million stations playing music intensive formats in a morning on FF

[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:41.540]
Because everybody's going to talk in the morning. Oh, yeah, right

[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:47.620]
There are most of the most of the stations now you can't even get 15 minutes of music mm-hmm

[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:54.140]
You you have a stereo sir. I do you have a cassette deck in your car. So what's the problem?

[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:57.000]
I'd load it up get some good stuff on it

[00:22:58.180 --> 00:22:59.240]
So you know

[00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:04.580]
Yeah, there was a lot of humor in that show right all that intentional. Yeah

[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:07.180]
Come on. Let's get serious will you please

[00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:10.420]
You're not going to bring them back and other they're not going to bring them back sir

[00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:14.940]
I hate to break the news to you. They're not coming back not tomorrow not a week from circus. They're not coming back

[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.180]
Well, yeah, this is one of the

[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:22.040]
Yes, slip into cassette and I hope it doesn't fall out you know

[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.000]
The morning's go off huh?

[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.140]
At 10 o'clock all the mornings go off

[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:27.080]
Yeah

[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.420]
Yeah, okay, I could handle

[00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:35.440]
Coming to work right now. Oh boy. I mean this guy likes psychotic if we don't if we destroyed your life

[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.940]
Have we disrupted your whole life sir?

[00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.940]
I mean you sound like you're having a good time. How long have you been calling in here this morning?

[00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:43.160]
I've been on for about

[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:45.860]
10 minutes and I don't think I heard one song

[00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.440]
We're not playing this is not a music show

[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:55.360]
Well, that's a m radio. This is that no. Oh, that's a m radio. See mr. stereo type. That's not a m radio

[00:23:55.360 --> 00:24:00.580]
There's a there's a talk station in Philadelphia that doesn't play one record all week long and they've been doing it for seven years

[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.180]
And they've got big numbers

[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:07.680]
So you're like what you're like one of those management people you're locked into this neuro mentality

[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.340]
You think that fm is one thing only okay

[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.260]
And up until recently it was one thing only we can't say it on the air

[00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:21.060]
You know we play music from 10 in the morning until six in the morning 20 hours a day on this radio

[00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:22.780]
Isn't that enough for you to get your fix?

[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.960]
20 hours a day man

[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:29.440]
Quality rock and roll banging out the doors and cc

[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:38.520]
Of the stones and the doors and the stones and ccr 20 hours a day of that crap and pink Floyd and the hurricane Floyd

[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:44.120]
I mean you got no sense of humor you just want to hear the same bad but he bad but he bad

[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.360]
You know enough is enough already. I just knocked my headphones
