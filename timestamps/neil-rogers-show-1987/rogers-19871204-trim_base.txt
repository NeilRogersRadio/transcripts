[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760]
Very definitely something to think about and of course that inspires me to new heights

[00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.940]
Yeah Dennis Collins is the only one who talks about knowing the true

[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.460]
Let me just pick up. Yeah, we want you to just pick up would you please

[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.180]

[00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.640]
Why do you say those nasty things?

[00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.240]
What do we do for you? What are you guys doing there this morning? Are you like on the air you just rehearsing?

[00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.540]
What's the question? What's the question?

[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.040]
Okay, how old is Joey Reynolds? That's the question

[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.920]
Okay, here's the next question. How hot is 105?

[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:29.460]
Oh, what about 62.3? Oh, I'm about 105 right now. Oh really are you well tuned it up

[00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.700]
Maybe we'll put it on the air you guys are playing pretty good music lately. I noticed

[00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.020]
Thank you. What are you on the air now? What happened? Yeah, we're on no. We're just sitting around having a coffee

[00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.840]
Are we on the air right now? Yes, you're on our air right now if you're on your air

[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.160]
I don't really give it to you. We don't care. Are we on your air?

[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.540]
Not yet. Oh, not yet. What is it?

[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.200]
Music offensive. I mean intensive. What does that mean not yet? In other words when you guys build the courage

[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.160]
You might put us on someday. Is that what you're saying?

[00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.440]
Why not?

[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.380]
Where the hell are your priorities anyway? You know, Tandard did a whole show for us yesterday

[00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.120]
I mean what about you guys? Well, you're supposed to be our good friends

[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.100]
Yeah, you're good friends. It's just that we have all these guys in Pittsburgh who aren't anybody's friend

[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.000]
Yeah, you got some problems up there. No question about

[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.940]
We do we got this consultant this guy named Chris Gabel and if you want to make a hell of a deal

[00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.080]
We'll send him over to you. We'll swap him for a Skyler. How's that?

[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.460]
I think we might

[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.120]
Maybe Donald Donald sounded frantic yesterday. Did you hear that those guys won't talk to us anymore?

[00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.000]
Why? What they're not gonna say? What are you saying?

[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.940]
No, we're gonna stick up there, but what's going on over there?

[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.460]
We had said that they were paranoid, but then we changed their mind because paranoia is an unnatural

[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.060]
Period one that's unwarranted

[00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.100]
unjustified very

[00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.660]
In their case, yeah, it's very justified. So they're not paranoid at all

[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.940]
They're just scared bleepless is what they are is the bottom line

[00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.980]
Well, I can understand why when you see those pictures of

[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.460]
of Greg in the in the hell yeah, oh

[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.060]
Stuff like show our home. Do you know something he is beginning to look more like Irene Richard every day

[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.040]
Yeah, and drag with don well with Donald's wedding dress. Did you see that picture?

[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.640]
No question about it. Well, I said guys. It's been wonderful having you as guests in our living rooms

[00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.460]
Let's not get into that. Yes, Jim Skyler. Oh, yeah, what about it Jim?

[00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.780]
You're gonna tell us the truth you're gonna kiss his butt again. You want you can you hold on for just a second?

[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.920]
Of course, okay, okay, hold on. Got a shoulder doing it. It's more important

[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.860]
Oh boy

[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.540]
George Michael is that just what we need your socks. Yeah

[00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.700]
It's 6.13 on Zeta 4

[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.080]
Cycle casting this morning with McCay in the morning and the gym scholar in hot 105

[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.020]
This could be the only show in America. Do you realize that the only morning show that

[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.500]
What's all the other morning shows on here? Why not really what I've heard of yeah

[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.420]
Hello, hello. There's no hotline anywhere, but here in the studio. I never knew that before

[00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.340]
What does that mean running around the building frantically trying to find a hotline?

[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.620]
Not even don't they even have one other phones work before nine o'clock? They've got them all shut off

[00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.400]
Don't they have one in the john over there? Hey, Barton. Don't they have one in the john?

[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.860]
No

[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.780]
Okay, that'll keep us in there too long, you know

[00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:46.340]
Hey, Christy's in there are great though. We've used that for a week or so. I would think so I've heard your show, you know what I'm saying

[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.380]
So what's the deal now? What what are we doing? Because we're hanging on here is the record over George Michael?

[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:59.040]
I mean, we don't play like George Michael records on Zeta, okay? No, we don't well on this show. We don't play hardly any records

[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.120]
When do I start?

[00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.600]
Well, what date would you like to start? What would be good for you?

[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:12.060]
No, no, no, hey, there's room for everybody's musical taste absolutely stop mine apparently. I don't know. I can't get a job, but anyway

[00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.160]
Now you want me to straighten out this whole business about how good was allegedly rude to me

[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.020]
Yeah, would you please and be honest don't don't worry about his feelings. Okay, cuz where there's no sense

[00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:27.020]
There's no feeling well Jim really doesn't want to straighten this out because he says he's getting such incredible name recognition

[00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.580]
Is it really it's been dragging on since about Jews?

[00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.860]
Well, it will end when we finally get the truth well

[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:40.520]
We had we got the truth and about you are you were rude and hostile and nasty kids kids, please don't fight. Okay, go ahead Jim

[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.480]
And I think he's gonna do a break are you gonna put these?

[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.060]
Hey, he's not even listening. No, don't worry about it. We don't we don't need to be on your air

[00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.580]
Don't worry. We didn't call to be superstars. Okay. Okay. We just call you doing the heck of a job

[00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.420]
Yes, we are of being superstars or just being jackasses

[00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.840]
So what's the real story Jim come on we've only got a four-hour show

[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.200]
I know that you love being on a real station, but what's a story? Yeah, it is a change of pace, but anyway

[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:11.400]
God a joke. It's just a joke. I know I know all our sales dogs are listening to you right now

[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.380]
Yeah, well our sales department's listening to and they're just a joke so don't worry about them

[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.800]
You know why are salespeople are listening? Why is that you got a straighting them out on this point too? They're trying to steal accounts

[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.620]
Come on, they're trying to steal accounts from us. Yeah, well, we don't have any I know

[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.180]
So what the hell is your story?

[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.340]
Boy talk about stupid

[00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.860]
Yeah, tell them to listen to a station with spots. Yeah, tell them to listen to the light think a lot of spots

[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000]
So anyway, so are you gonna answer the question or we're just gonna have to uh, said it's just a joke what

[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.860]
That's all I have no that was referring to something else. Oh, okay. That was wishful thinking on your part

[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.920]
Now you're gonna tell the audience how the bird just

[00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.380]
Totally showed you a rude and callous kind of behavior that day

[00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:04.800]
Well, see those the whole thing hinges on the fact that you missed part of our our conversation when we're standing in the atrium. Yes

[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:13.400]
Glenn turned to me at one point and he said something to me that you didn't hear really something we can say on the air

[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.260]
He said he was going out to his car to get a gun. Yeah

[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.000]
Oh

[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.580]
It's big excuse himself. He had to answer the call of nature. I see

[00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.660]
And you didn't hear one of that have to do with they came in the

[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.660]
He said then he said well when you went into the studio

[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.060]
It was where you're continuing the act of nature quietly in the studio or well

[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.860]
I went back we all went into the studio right remember Jim yeah

[00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.980]
It was during a news break and he says at that time

[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:45.760]
I like turned my back on you and was incredibly rude to you were you were just I didn't notice that I see

[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.480]
And I didn't notice it either Jim I

[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:55.220]
I didn't notice that because now you didn't notice it I didn't notice it conversation and I was also watching the clock because I didn't want to

[00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.620]
So you got absolutely

[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.520]
Right I didn't want to horn in on the program exactly so you had absolutely not one

[00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:06.820]
Any feeling of rudeness that was not in your brain whatsoever that day

[00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:07.680]
And whatsoever

[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:13.740]
I'm sorry to have to admit that because I know this may or probably put a stop tomorrow. Oh, I don't know about that

[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.240]
Pretty obvious that the guy is so hard up for a job, but he's just gonna

[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:22.400]
You know kiss your he's gonna be a liquor fan right to the very end and we're never gonna get the true story out of him

[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.460]
That's okay. We understand

[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.900]

All right, it's 620 now on Zeta 4 now, but in the news this morning we're gonna finally put this thing to rest

[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:08.060]
I hope about Jim Skyler and my son. Why are we really? Is that the big news story? Don't you think it is? No

[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:14.980]
You don't you don't buy it. You think this is bigger than the settlement of the world was Peter Moon this morning by the way

[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.500]
What's that cut to do?

[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:27.860]
What'd be do?

[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.960]
I would have gone to the concert if we could have had the morning off. That would have been great

[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:38.600]
You're not gonna discuss this with me. You're just gonna ignore this. You're gonna what you're about this Jim Skyler

[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:40.440]
Faltarol

[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:49.200]
Yeah

[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:54.660]
Okay, all you kids out there like who want to be professional more on when you grow up

[00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:59.200]
Okay, and there's something to be said for that because look what it did for sliced alone an Arnold Schwarzenegger, right?

[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.600]
So you're not gonna talk about it. You want to be a professional moron just keep listening to the bird

[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.820]
You're not gonna talk about it. In fact, you can develop an instant vocabulary

[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:15.740]
You're be sitting in the library. I'll tell you that the signing of an agreement between Cuban inmates and federal authority has brought liberty for 89 hot to

[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:23.380]
Disheld at the US penance entry in Atlanta. They released hostages shook hands with the detainees and hugged federal officials during their walk to freedom.

[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:24.980]
Haven't you always wanted a hug of federal

[00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:25.300]
Affection?

[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:27.800]
Let's think about it.

[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:35.880]
God, you're up the image in your head. The Atlanta prison settlement calls for a moratorium on deporting detainees who arrived during the 1980

[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:41.060]
Marial boat lift. It also says the Cubans will not be held responsible for damage to the prison.

[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:47.200]
Zayda forecast partly cloudy becoming breezy later today. A smallcraft advisory will go into effect later.

[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:55.140]
High today 76 low tonight 49 and currently 54 at Zayda 4 at 622.

[00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.140]
The following monthly payment offer based on

[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.980]
Wequel Reagan mids Gorbachev unsuperpower summit up.

[00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:03.300]
That's who we were right at the beginning.

[00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:07.320]
This is Jakob Smirna.

[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.020]
I beg your pardon.

[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:18.040]
All this week while Reagan mids Gorbachev unsuperpower summit I'll be right here on Zayda 4 for the great comedy summit of 1987.

[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:20.740]
That was great.

[00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:26.520]
Okay, it's 24 past 6 on Zayda 4. I thought I would just audition it on the air and see if it was any good, right?

[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:27.740]
What a waste of time.

[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:33.240]
Okay, let's take some more calls. The lines are just a frantic here this morning. You think we have more complaints?

[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.980]
Like that first one? Don't call us for more material?

[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.760]
Who was that? Stan's personal secretary?

[00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:45.160]
Oh, you're not. Your mic isn't open. That's why you're so quiet. I wondered why you weren't saying a damn thing.

[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:51.320]
Plus we open his mic. He just claims up. No, I'm still contemplating that phone call. A hot 105.

[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:52.640]
Dave County, hello.

[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.000]
Hi, Mr. Rogers.

[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:57.540]
Yes. I just came back from New York two weeks ago.

[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:04.140]
Yes, the... in the accepted Taiwaner local pimples as a secondary rat eye.

[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.140]
Yeah, what do you sound secondary to me, sir?

[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:13.160]
Anyhow, it says the question of organizations...

[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:20.040]
A president in operation wanted me to correct my name because he said it wasn't the dignified for their temple.

[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:26.680]
And I refused to correct my name to the one we call ourselves Irving Cutter.

[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:31.240]
And I refused to take that because I will graduate.

[00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:31.640]
I'm sure.

[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:33.540]
I cutter.

[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:34.220]
Yeah.

[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:42.780]
And that's another extension for name. And they refused to have me unless I went to a short version of name.

[00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:48.080]
Okay, listen, if you play cards right, I'll give you Joey's hotline number. Okay, you can call him the audition.

[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:50.960]
Geez.

[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:58.380]
Okay, if you get any other people at over the age of 90, give them the number for WNWN or something.

[00:15:58.380 --> 00:15:59.520]
I don't want to talk to him.

[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:04.880]
26 past six on Zeta 4, there's an open line in date at 620 3600.

[00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:07.960]
And let's go to Broward County. Hello.

[00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:09.040]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:10.280]
Okay, sir.

[00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:14.000]
We're going to enjoy your show. I listen to it every morning.

[00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.660]
I get up about 430s about the same time you do.

[00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.560]
Yeah. Well, that's good, but not in my house, Daniel.

[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:26.020]
I'm on the restaurant in Dearfield and I put that radio on and I listen to it as I'm cooking my eggs in the morning.

[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.960]
Yep, well, this show will fry your eggs. There's no question about that.

[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:35.080]
I think it's just great now that I love all the guys on there and you got great humor.

[00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:38.580]
Yeah. And it really gets me up in the morning. Let me tell you.

[00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:40.040]
Well, that's good. That's the idea.

[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:40.680]
So to speak.

[00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.980]
Okay, well, you've been a great caller. Certainly an improvement over the couple we've had so far.

[00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:47.860]
See you later.

[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:49.680]
Okay. I'll read the darchie.

[00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:51.820]
27 past six.

[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.620]
And we might as well give this one last try.

[00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:55.880]
Uh-oh. Huh?

[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.940]
Well, I don't give up easily. I know. I'm just drawing the towel.

[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.700]
Now, are you not going to call Greg and Donald?

[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.620]
Yes, I am. They're going to hang up on you.

[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:06.300]
Well, he has no choice. He's been, he's got a directive for management.

[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:09.380]
Let me tell you something. We get directives from management too.

[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:11.220]
And we go on the air. We tell it like it is.

[00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:13.980]
We announce to the audience that management is brain dead.

[00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.400]
And we fight for our rights, don't we?

[00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:19.060]
Uh, but you're not Greg.

[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:20.720]
We fight for our rights.

[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:24.800]
No, that's true. We're not nervous and insecure.

[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:25.380]
Yeah.

[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:32.160]
And if we were Greg and had his number really nervous and insecure.

[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:33.920]
I'm telling you he's just going to.

[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:37.280]
All right, well, giving him one more chance. That's what I'm going to tell him.

[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.620]
It's 28 past six on Zeta 4.

[00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.100]
And now these guys have been.

[00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:46.220]
They've been under a lot of pressure, okay?

[00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:49.060]
We do want that by by tape though.

[00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:50.320]
Yeah, Donald could do one.

[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.760]
Yeah, if you don't want to talk to us, the least you could do is cut us an.

[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:53.160]
Hello.

[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.480]
Okay, now don't hang up right away. Come on.

[00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:56.540]
Please.

[00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.860]
You know what? You can't play anymore.

[00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.040]
Now don't hang up right away. Just think about it.

[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:04.660]
Oh, no, no, no, no.

[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:06.720]
Hang up.

[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.480]
By the oralons.

[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:10.340]
Did they hang up?

[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.680]
They hung up. Don't hang up by the oralons. Remember that record?

[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:13.860]
Sure.

[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:15.680]
Don't hang up. Yeah. They hung up.

[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.240]
They hung up. No, got no balls, Greg.

[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.080]
Cheers. They can't play anymore.

[00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.560]
That sounds like something out of a sandbox, doesn't it?

[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:26.860]
I gave him one last chance.

[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:28.740]
I will call Donald after 10.

[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.000]
For what? See if he'll cut that tape for it.

[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:31.760]
He won't do it.

[00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:33.980]
The tape is not the important thing.

[00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:37.920]
The important thing is that we during these last few days on this show

[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.540]
have developed something just totally unique.

[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.860]
I mean, on the AMO is a different story because we were not competing.

[00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:45.280]
We weren't even on the same band.

[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.160]
We weren't on the same day part.

[00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:51.320]
But here in the last few days, we've developed something that's just unheard of.

[00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:56.160]
And we've got all the competition on the show at the same time.

[00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:57.120]
I know. I know.

[00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.380]
And they want to destroy it.

[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:00.580]
They want to ruin a good thing.

[00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:04.200]
Well, they're the only ones who listen to their show and you realize they have no act.

[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.820]
You would think that they want anything innovative and new.

[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.920]
They do. It's the bandage.

[00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:12.840]
But you want to run it by again.

[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.560]
I'm going to say it to you again.

[00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:18.580]
Management in this business is all incompetent and brain dead.

[00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:19.340]
Well, I know that.

[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.020]
All underlying all in red.

[00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:23.000]
Okay. Exactly.

[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:27.040]
In any color you like, in technicality, in code of color.

[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.460]
All right. They're all brain dead.

[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:30.640]
They're a bunch of morons.

[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.900]
All right. And the way you deal, first of all, he's got a contract over there.

[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:36.680]
He's the program director for crying out loud.

[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.120]
They letting him play what he wants to.

[00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:40.280]
Exactly. Like they let him play with Donald.

[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:46.720]
So what kind of a gutless wonder is this Videl turning into anyway?

[00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:48.040]
We can't play anymore.

[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:51.260]
But boy, he's the program director in Dave.

[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:56.460]
In name only. Obviously he's got about as much clout as Irma LaDuce has over here.

[00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:57.180]
John Morrow.

[00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:58.660]
They had to give him that title.

[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:00.220]
Yeah. They just gave the title.

[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:01.020]
They promoted the real.

[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:04.140]
I got news. If they wanted to pay me that amount, I wouldn't need any title.

[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:05.980]
Okay. I would be over there tomorrow.

[00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:07.300]
Tomorrow.

[00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.960]
And if John Morrow is listening, I think you're a pretty good guy.

[00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:12.400]
Six thirty on Zeta 4.

[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:16.860]
And where do we have that open line is in date counting at six two oh.

[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:18.200]
What would happen to us?

[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.040]
36 hundred. You're on your own.

[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.480]
Go back to the breakfast club.

[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.840]
Six two oh thirty six hundred.

[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:26.720]
You notice all the people from the U2 concert.

[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.160]
We're just one.

[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:30.000]
Yeah. See, that's the part.

[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.140]
How many people were there?

[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.760]
About 70,000 something like that.

[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.100]
75,000.

[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:37.200]
Okay. Well, this is a market of four million people.

[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:41.460]
So all the rest of the three million nine hundred and twenty five thousand people

[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:46.140]
who were not there yesterday, they don't give two hoots about the U2 concert.

[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:49.100]
All right. And they didn't care about all that hype and all that hysteria.

[00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:50.300]
Did they?

[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:51.960]
Absolutely not.

[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.920]
In fact, most of them probably don't even like U2.

[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.060]
Well, they're very popular.

[00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.040]
They're very popular.

[00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:58.340]
They're very popular.

[00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:58.660]
They're very popular.

[00:20:58.660 --> 00:20:58.800]
They're very popular.

[00:20:58.880 --> 00:20:59.020]
They're very popular.

[00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:01.880]
They're very popular.

[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:11.740]
They're very popular.

[00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:12.180]
They're very popular.

[00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:12.180]

[00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:12.200]
They're very popular.

[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:12.220]
They're very popular.

[00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:12.220]

[00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:12.220]

[00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:12.220]

[00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:12.220]

[00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:12.460]
They're very popular.

[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:12.460]

[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:12.620]
They're very popular.

[00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:12.700]
They're very popular.

[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:12.700]

[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:13.580]
They're very popular.

[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:14.040]
They're very popular.

[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:14.700]
They're very popular.

[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:17.060]

They're very popular.

[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:03.660]
Listen to the level on these calls, man.

[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:03.820]

[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:04.940]
You can barely hear this guy.

[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:05.160]
You can barely hear this guy.

[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:05.660]
Yeah, how you doing?

[00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:05.780]
How you doing?

[00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:05.880]
How you doing?

[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:06.520]
Go ahead.

[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.020]
It's not your fault, sir.

[00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:08.480]
It's not your fault, sir.

[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:08.480]

[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:08.820]
It's not your fault, sir.

[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:09.980]
It's not your fault, sir.

[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:10.800]
It's not your fault, sir.

[00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:12.800]
It's not your fault, sir.

[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:12.900]
It's not your fault, sir.

[00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.020]
It's not your fault, sir.

[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:14.740]
It's not your fault, sir.

[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.400]
It's not your fault, sir.

[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:17.180]
It's not your fault, sir.

[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.440]
It's not your fault, sir.

[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:23.540]
It's not your fault, sir.

[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:31.220]
It's not your fault, sir.

[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:33.520]
I'm obsessed with the show.

[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.540]
That's funny, because I never listened to it.

[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:41.340]
But then on top of that, he says that you do pretty well, you know, considering that you've been stealing his materials the last seven years.

[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:44.800]
Oh, yeah.

[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:45.540]
Oh, yeah.

[00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:45.760]
Oh, yeah.

[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:51.320]
I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I don't know if you're aware of that, but this guy uses a lot of your phrases.

[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.080]
No kidding.

[00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:52.580]
Yeah.

[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:53.560]
Unbelievable.

[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:56.520]
It's just a coincidence, sir.

[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.940]
Sir, the word you're looking for is clone, okay?

[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:01.540]
CLONE as in clone heads.

[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:03.120]
He's a tallion, you know what I mean?

[00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:07.020]
On a tallion, he uses these Jewish expressions.

[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:07.760]
Yeah, I know that.

[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:07.980]
Yeah.

[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.080]
And he doesn't even know what they mean.

[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.140]
Well, I don't know why we would discuss Alice.

[00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:13.020]
He's so passé.

[00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.320]
He's like Alice Bluegown these days.

[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.020]
He's like from the Dark Ages.

[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:22.420]
And, you know, one last thing, if you're going to play Elvis, you know, play some concert cuts.

[00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:23.380]
Yeah, okay.

[00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:24.580]
Like, idiot stuff, that's correct.

[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.460]
Yeah, like Elvis in Vegas, right?

[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:27.500]
Oh, no, man.

[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.120]
Like, like, like, it's now or never where he forgot the lyrics.

[00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:33.040]
That's why my favorite, too.

[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:34.620]
Okay, sir.

[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.040]
Hi, sir.

[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.180]
Thanks for the info.

[00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:36.740]
All right.

[00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:37.620]
Right, bye-bye.

[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.620]
634 on Zeta4, 26 before 7 on a Friday morning.

[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.040]
And I feel wide awake this morning.

[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:47.160]
I actually got an extra hour sleep.

[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:48.020]
Really?

[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.520]
I don't know why, but it just worked out that way in my house.

[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:51.380]
Didn't have to watch.

[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.440]
I wasn't forced to watch David Letterman last night.

[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:55.540]
So I really feel wide awake.

[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:56.740]
It's re-runs this week.

[00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:57.280]
It is.

[00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:57.700]
Yeah.

[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:58.960]
Yeah, one of the old duty.

[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.060]
We were talking about something in 1985.

[00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:03.120]
Well, they were a couple nights ago.

[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:03.300]
Right.

[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.380]
Well, it's all re-runs this week.

[00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:04.540]
Yeah.

[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:06.800]
Well, and his show is not worth watching the first time.

[00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:08.160]
Well, I disagree.

[00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:09.140]
I watched.

[00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:09.520]
You would.

[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:11.340]
I don't understand the humor.

[00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:13.020]
I guess I must be very stupid, yeah.

[00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:13.260]
Right.

[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:13.660]
No.

[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:17.940]
You just, you probably just start having a watching out into it enough.

[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.740]
You know, you got to, it's like in the other kind of show.

[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.500]
You got to watch it for a while, right?

[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:25.040]
And also, I understand that there was a major episode of Not's Landing.

[00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:28.920]
You talked about it yesterday morning last night and somehow it didn't make it in my house.

[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.060]
You were on the spot.

[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:30.780]
Serious.

[00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:33.500]
Someone was watching re-runs of Sanford and Sun or something.

[00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:36.620]
And I was just, you know, half passed out and not paying any attention.

[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:38.480]
Then at about 1130, it dawned on me.

[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.500]
A little light bulb lit up over my head.

[00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:41.960]
You've lost that show.

[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:43.880]
I've lost control of my TV set.

[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.220]
Well, is your TV set really?

[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:46.400]

[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:47.100]
And, yeah.

[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.240]
You bought it.

[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.220]
You paid for it.

[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:49.620]
Yes.

[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:50.640]
You set up.

[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:51.260]
And my cable.

[00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.600]
It's your cable that you pay every month for.

[00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:53.880]
Correct.

[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:56.460]
So how did you lose control?

[00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:58.280]
Well, I don't have the clicker box.

[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.520]
No, that's not yours.

[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:02.540]
No, I only rent that out.

[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:03.840]
635.

[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:05.800]
Xeta 4.

[00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:07.840]
And let's take another one from Dave.

[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:09.120]
Two in a row from Dave County.

[00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:09.460]
Hello.

[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:10.180]
Morning.

[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:10.780]
I'm impressed.

[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:11.300]
Yes, sir.

[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:11.880]
How are you?

[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:12.240]
Good.

[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.700]
Just out here visiting my daughter.

[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.720]
I think you guys got a really good show going down here.

[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:17.780]
Thank you so much.

[00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:19.260]
Where you're from, sir?

[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:19.780]
Oh, hi.

[00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:20.660]
I'm Ron Kemp.

[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:21.960]
What's Ethan Oh, hi.

[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:22.420]
Yeah.

[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:24.880]
There's a station up there.

[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:26.960]
There's a facility there's they have a morning show guy.

[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:27.900]
There's a lot of joke, isn't he?

[00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:28.720]
And it's Stan also.

[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:29.800]
Stan also?

[00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:31.420]
Well, my name is not Stan.

[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:32.180]
And so...

[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.400]
Like what I said, Stan too.

[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:33.860]
Yeah.

[00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:34.980]
Well, let me say it against her.

[00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.080]
My name isn't Stan.

[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:36.960]
My name is Neil.

[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:37.860]
The last time I checked.

[00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:38.520]
Neil Rogers?

[00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:40.020]
Do you have a Stan there?

[00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:43.220]
We have a Stan on the AM on WINZ who works in the afternoon

[00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:44.760]
who's on a dying station, yeah.

[00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.180]
Well, that's why I was referring to him.

[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:46.720]
Well, I see.

[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:47.560]
I see.

[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.760]
Well, I just want to keep that straight.

[00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:50.680]
Enjoy a lot of the customs you have down here.

[00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:53.720]
You know, they're running over your toes with the shopping carts.

[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:54.740]
Yeah, that's good.

[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:55.860]
That's one of my favorites.

[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.160]
How about stealing the sweet and loaded?

[00:25:58.180 --> 00:25:58.900]
Do they do that in Ohio?

[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:00.780]
I don't think so.

[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:01.380]
Yeah.

[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.540]
I don't think so, really.

[00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:07.000]
But, uh, well, they said that you guys really made sure of her.

[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:07.960]
Yes, we do.

[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.320]
Well, it's great hearing from you.

[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.000]
And I'm sure you're a lot happier to be here than in Ohio right now, right?

[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:13.720]
I guess, I can smell it right now.

[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:14.420]
Yeah.

[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:16.060]
Okay, well, have a wonderful day, sir.

[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:16.560]
Thank you.

[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:17.220]
And a great life.

[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:18.680]
Okay.

[00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:20.960]
I think that was the same guy that called the beginning of the show

[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.240]
despising his voice.

[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:23.900]
636 on Zeta 4.

[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.080]
And I guess we ought to do this now,

[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.220]
because I'm sure we'll get requests to play it again later.

[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.360]
It's the all-new Libetopiever,

[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:34.940]
starring Barbara Billingsley,

[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:36.740]
Hugh Beaumont,

[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:38.560]
Tony Dome,

[00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:42.040]
and Clint Eastwood as the Bieber.

[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:43.680]
Bieber?

[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:45.680]
Uh, yeah, mom.

[00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:46.940]
What is it?

[00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:48.860]
There's a package down here,

[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:49.960]
but I just came in the mail.

[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.380]
Looks like it's from Bubbles.

[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:55.320]
Isn't that that girl you know at school?

[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:56.880]
No, she's a hooker.

[00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:57.840]
She's hooky.

[00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:00.340]
Well, hooky, she plays hooky from school a lot.

[00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:01.640]
That's where I know her from.

[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.280]
Later, up in the boys' room.

[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:09.040]
Hey, Wally, look, I got a package from Bubbles.

[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:09.980]
Oh, yeah?

[00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:11.320]
What did she send you?

[00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:12.740]
I see her.

[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:15.860]
Oh, geez.

[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:17.760]
She sent me her underwear.

[00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:18.940]
What?

[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:22.040]
I got a quit hangin' around those kind of women.

[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.320]
I suppose I couldn't say I told you so, but...

[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.160]
I guess this is no time to be rubbing it in.

[00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:30.340]
Well, as long as Mom and Dad don't find out,

[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.760]
I'll just hide him in the drawer here.

[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:36.740]
Later, that same episode.

[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:43.340]
Boy, look what I found in Beavers' drawer.

[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:45.820]
Where'd that come from?

[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.760]
Uh-oh, I think I'm in trouble.

[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:49.000]
Big trouble.

[00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:50.960]
Uh, Mom, Dad,

[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.960]
those underwear belong to, uh,

[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:55.680]
to Wally.

[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:56.420]
Wally?

[00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.240]
You're talkin' about.

[00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:00.860]
Yeah, there he is.

[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:05.520]
He wears them, presses around in them like, like Tinkerbell.

[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:07.160]
Isn't that right?

[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:09.060]
Big brother.

[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:10.520]
Yeah.

[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:17.460]
Okay, now yesterday we called Luke Halpin,

[00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:19.380]
and maybe today we can call Tony Dow.

[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:20.720]
Would that be something?

[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:22.960]
I know a lot of guys get excited.

[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:24.000]
I know you're excited about that.

[00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:28.040]
Uh, most of the guys, 6.38, on Zeta4, will be right back.

[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:28.940]
Pameter cat.

[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:30.740]
So come to the sports authority,

[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.160]
you've never seen anything quite like it.

[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:36.680]
The sports authority, Oakland Park Boulevard, and Route 441.

[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.320]
Neil wakes me up in the morning.

[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:40.500]
And I'm on it.

[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.660]
Neil wakes me up with a smile.

[00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:44.080]
With a smile, yeah.

[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.320]
Drinking my coffee, a bunch of nama donut.

[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.660]
Whips to the floor of the dark.

[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:54.360]
Get ready to go to school with Neil.

[00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:56.960]
Whips to the floor of the dial.

[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:01.520]
Trying to do work in my room with a dolly nail.

[00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:03.700]
Whips to the floor of my dial.

[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:04.820]
Ooh, really.

[00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:06.340]
Neil, Neil, Neil.

[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:08.240]
We need a one-kit.

[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:10.500]
Neil, Neil, Neil, Neil.

[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:11.880]
We need a one-kit.

[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:13.320]
Neil, Neil, Neil.

[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:15.120]
We need a one-kit.

[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:16.540]
Neil, Neil, Neil.

[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:20.340]
I wonder why Dan McKay and Jim Schuyler talked to us for about 10 minutes.

[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:25.980]
And it didn't seem to be suffering from any kind of insecurity, hysteria, or juvenile behavior.

[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:32.200]
And yet when we called Donald and Noodles, there seemed to be some serious problems over there.

[00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:34.800]
Yeah, at what of five they didn't seem to care about.

[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.380]
Yeah, and like what we called Bill Tanner yesterday at Power 96,

[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:41.780]
he did like a five-minute show he brought Carmen on, and Dr. Root, and all his characters,

[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:42.640]
and they were great.

[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.100]
Far close.

[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:47.640]
And when we called even Joey yesterday, we had a great, a classic call, one of the greats

[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:48.700]
in the history of Broadcasting.

[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:49.620]
He was super.

[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:53.620]
And we have on tape if anybody would like to send a cassette in.

[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:54.100]
Ah!

[00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:57.300]
You'd like your very own copy of the Joey Reynolds call.

[00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:58.100]
It's a joke.

[00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:02.720]
For example, if you got a talk show and you don't have any material left, Stan,

[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:08.860]
we'll be more than happy to supply you with your own copy so you can do like about a half an hour on it, like he did yesterday.

[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.260]
Can you believe that?

[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:12.540]
I mean, what relevance is there?

[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:18.060]
In all seriousness, what relevance is there between the Stan major show and my call to Joey?

[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.080]
Oh, well, can you see the connection?

[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:23.240]
The reason he gave was that Joey talked about him.

[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:24.600]
You know, Joey mentioned Stan.

[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:25.080]
So?

[00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:26.200]
Well, that...

[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.280]
What does that have to do with anything?

[00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:29.460]
Well, you have to ask Stan, but that's the reason he gave.

[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:30.680]
Okay.

[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:32.160]
Now who are we calling?

[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:37.360]
Yeah.

[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.840]
It's a wonderful day in the neighborhood.

[00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:43.660]
It's 184 or 7 on Zeta 4 and you're just sneezing up a storm.

[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:44.820]
I'm a little stuffed up.

[00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:47.400]
Another one of those people who has a cold and doesn't want to admit it.

[00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:48.520]
No, I do something wrong.

[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:49.040]
No.

[00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:50.380]
I didn't.

[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:52.180]
I think you only hit six buttons.

[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.900]
And I don't have a cold.

[00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:59.060]
You don't have a cold?

[00:30:59.240 --> 00:30:59.380]
No.

[00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:00.160]
I'm just a little...

[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:00.940]
Just keep saying that.

[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:01.980]
I'm just a little...

[00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:03.640]
Hey, here we go.

[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:04.800]
I was stuffed up, yes.

[00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:08.580]
This is going to be kind of interesting to see what kind of a reception we get here on this phone call.

[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:09.740]
Oh my God.

[00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:11.700]
No, it's going to be fascinating to me.

[00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:14.640]
In fact, it'll be really fascinating if they ever picked a damn phone up.

[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:16.480]
That's what's going to be really exciting.

[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:17.460]
Is this like a hotline?

[00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:19.240]
This is like another...

[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:19.780]
Luke War...

[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:20.800]
Luke Halpin Warmline.

[00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:22.900]
Dennis Collins, home.

[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:23.080]
Yeah.

[00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:25.000]
Oh, I'd love to have that number.

[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:25.600]
I'll tell you that.

[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:29.160]
We'd start calling him a vibe coming early, about 4.30 in the morning.

[00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:33.660]
And we play all our new material for him over the phone.

[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:36.420]
How can they not be answering the warm liars?

[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:37.140]
Is that possible?

[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:38.980]
Is this another radio station?

[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:40.200]
Well, just could be.

[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:41.580]
I think I know who this is.

[00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:42.100]
Do you really?

[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:42.580]
Yeah.

[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:44.540]
What's your guess?

[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.080]
Oh, and someone else answered.

[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:48.120]
Oh, I remember I was answering the phone.

[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:49.980]
Oh, I remember something on here.

[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:54.540]
Yeah, well, they're listening to those suggestions to improve the station.

[00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:54.840]
Oh, yeah.

[00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:55.800]
I got that number too.

[00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:59.140]
I still haven't had a chance to organize, which is good, because we're going to have a chance to organize.

[00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:10.820]
So, we're going to have a chance to organize.

[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:11.380]
We're going to have a chance to organize.

[00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:11.440]
We're going to have a chance to organize.

[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:11.460]
We're going to have a chance to organize.

[00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:11.460]

[00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:11.640]
We're going to have a chance to organize.

[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:11.920]
We're going to have a chance to organize.

[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:12.620]
We're going to have a chance to organize.

[00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:13.700]
We're going to have a chance to organize.

[00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:13.700]

[00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:13.780]
We're going to have a chance to organize.

[00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:14.480]
We're going to have a chance to organize.

[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.060]
We're going to have a chance to organize.

[00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:15.380]
We're going to have a chance to organize.

[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:16.640]
We're going to have a chance to organize.

[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:22.920]
We're going to have a chance to organize.

[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:26.840]
We're going to have a chance to organize.

[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:29.120]
We're going to have a chance to organize.

[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:33.880]
Try to clear the cobwebs out of your eye, sunny, and answer that fall.

[00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:35.620]
I think you dialed correctly.

[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:38.060]

[00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:18.860]
I am positive that I dialed the correct number.

[00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:21.880]
I am positive that I dialed the correct number.

[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:24.640]
I am positive that I dialed the correct number.

[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:25.560]
I am positive that I dialed the correct number.

[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:29.080]
I am positive that I dialed the correct number.

[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:33.080]
I am positive that I dialed the correct number.

[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:43.360]
I am positive that I dialed the correct number.

[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:43.360]

[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:43.360]

[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:43.360]

[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:43.360]

[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:43.380]
I am positive that I dialed the correct number.

[00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:43.380]

[00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:43.500]
I am positive that I dialed the correct number.

[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:43.520]
I am positive that I dialed the correct number.

[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:45.000]
I am positive that I dialed the correct number.

[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.080]
I am positive that I dialed the correct number.

[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:47.340]
I am positive that I dialed the correct number.

[00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:48.440]
I am positive that I dialed the correct number.

[00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:52.840]
I am positive that I dialed the correct number.

[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:53.960]
I am positive that I dialed the correct number.

[00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:59.060]
I am positive that I dialed the correct number.

[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:00.940]
Checking out the license and see what that renewal date is.

[00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:01.680]
Checking out the license and see what that renewal date is.

[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:03.280]
Checking out the license and see what that renewal date is.

[00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:06.060]
Okay, 646 on Zeta4.

[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:06.160]

[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:06.160]

[00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:06.300]

[00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:06.400]
Okay, 646 on Zeta4.

[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:06.460]
Okay, 646 on Zeta4.

[00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:06.500]
Okay, 646 on Zeta4.

Okay, 646 on Zeta4.

[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:07.380]
Okay, 646 on Zeta4.

[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:08.820]
Okay, 646 on Zeta4.

[00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:08.820]

[00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:11.780]
Okay, 646 on Zeta4.

[00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:15.940]
Okay, 646 on Zeta4.

[00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:18.060]
Okay, 646 on Zeta4.

[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:27.880]
Okay, 646 on Zeta4.

[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:29.040]
Okay, 646 on Zeta4.

[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:40.000]
Okay, 646 on Zeta4.

[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:40.960]

[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:40.960]

[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:40.960]

[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:40.960]

[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:41.560]
Okay, 646 on Zeta4.

[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:42.160]
Okay, 646 on Zeta4.

[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:45.300]
Okay, 646 on Zeta4.

[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:46.720]
Okay, 646 on Zeta4.

[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:46.720]

[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:46.720]

[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:46.760]
Okay, 646 on Zeta4.

[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:47.020]
Okay, 646 on Zeta4.

[00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:48.000]
Okay, 646 on Zeta4.

[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:48.200]
Okay, 646 on Zeta4.

[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:50.780]
Okay, 646 on Zeta4.

[00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:51.700]
Okay, 646 on Zeta4.

[00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:52.520]
Okay, 646 on Zeta4.

[00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:55.320]
Okay, 646 on Zeta4.

[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:58.680]
Okay, 646 on Zeta4.

[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:01.060]
Hey, this is the Nearodgers on Zeta4.

[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:02.080]
Hi, Neal.

[00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:02.600]
How you doing?

[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:03.780]
Okay, we're on the air.

[00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:04.520]
What's Sunny doing?

[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:06.140]
Is he eating a banana or what?

[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:09.600]
Sunny's busy right now because he plans to show out in advance.

[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:10.780]
Oh, does he really?

[00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:11.280]
Yeah.

[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:13.020]
That's a novel idea.

[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:15.100]
Why don't you do that, Neal?

[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.440]
You never know that from listening.

[00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:18.100]
Listen, I'm real busy.

[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.880]
In other words, you're going to shine this, is that it?

[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:23.800]
No, I'd like to talk, but I've got really important things to do.

[00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:25.620]
Like a radio show?

[00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:26.580]
Hey, you got it.

[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:27.460]
It's playing in advance.

[00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:28.160]
Yeah, seeing Neal.

[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:28.880]
Okay, bye.

[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:31.040]
Oh, well, planned in advance.

[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:32.580]
You see, you know what that is?

[00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:34.940]
It's like Joey says the same thing like he sits in, right?

[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:40.800]
If you don't have any kind of a mind, and if you don't have any spontaneous humor, or any kind of, you know,

[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:43.440]
then you need to sit down and write all that stuff out.

[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:44.380]
We don't do that.

[00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:45.840]
And I would never do it.

[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:48.460]
I just couldn't do that because it's contrived.

[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:49.240]
Right.

[00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:50.900]
Like writing a script for a plane.

[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:51.920]
Now, that's a different thing.

[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.300]
Most of the fun of your stuff is like why you're on your own.

[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:55.520]
Spontaneous, of course.

[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:59.840]
If you're quick on your feet or quick on your ass, is the case maybe, that's what it's all about.

[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:02.800]
Now, you know, Joey's sidekick Bill Marshall.

[00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:03.380]
Yeah.

[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:04.160]
You know who that is?

[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:05.600]
He was John.

[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.040]
That's Penny Marshall's brother, I think.

[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:07.240]
Right.

[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.680]
And he was also Johnny Dark's board opposite.

[00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:10.940]
Oh, when you were in B.C.

[00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:13.840]
Jeez, am I impressed with that piece of radio trivia?

[00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:14.860]
Another board opposite.

[00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:17.680]
The board opposite are doing so well in this city, don't you say?

[00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:19.260]
Especially Johnny Dark's board opposite.

[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:21.080]
They're making money.

[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:22.480]
He's on the beat somewhere.

[00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:23.900]
He can't even find himself a job.

[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.440]
That's all true by the way.

[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:28.760]
Ten of seven out of seven.

[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:34.320]
A turnies for comedian Joan Rivers say they know who Bert Hacker is.

[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:39.260]
Now, Hacker was a pseudonym for the author of the article in gentleman's quarterly

[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:41.900]
that prompted Rivers to threaten a $50 million lawsuit.

[00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:47.860]
Rivers denounced the article earlier this week during a tearful news conference in LA

[00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:49.380]
and demanded a retraction.

[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:54.100]
The story painted a bleak picture of Rivers' marriage to the late Edgar Rosenberg,

[00:36:54.520 --> 00:37:00.420]
a spokesman declined to name names, but says the ID will be revealed when the suit is filed.

[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:04.380]
You know, when you stop and think about this Waco who answered the phone for Sonny

[00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:07.900]
and you think back to all of the mobile calls that Sonny made to me

[00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:09.500]
while I was on in midday on AM.

[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:10.060]
Oh, yeah.

[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:14.060]
Now, how did we manage to take those and put them on the air spontaneously?

[00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:17.700]
Because I guess the show should have all been planned out ahead of time.

[00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:20.940]
Like every call should have been contrived or something.

[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:21.660]
Oh, was it?

[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:22.700]
It wasn't?

[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:23.460]
I don't remember.

[00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:25.220]
I don't think so.

[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.500]
It doesn't ring any bells with me.

[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:31.500]
So in other words, what this guy is saying is that Sonny just doesn't have enough sense of humor

[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:36.700]
or a spontaneity to do a bit on the air unprepared without writing it out longhand.

[00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:37.800]
Wow.

[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:38.900]
Sort of like Joey.

[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:41.820]
Yeah, well, let's not get carried away.

[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:42.580]
It's like the number one.

[00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:43.280]
We like Joey.

[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:44.500]
You're okay, Joey.

[00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:44.900]
Yeah.

[00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:48.920]
But I have a feeling that that first call we had this morning, I think that was from Joey's people.

[00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:49.640]
You do?

[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.260]
Well, we'll find out what we call Roger.

[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:52.500]
We'll call him again a little later.

[00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:52.940]
Okay.

[00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:54.420]
Joey's, he loves us.

[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:55.080]
I know.

[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:57.280]
He only wishes he had a piece of that nine-shot.

[00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.720]
And I thought Sonny loved you, too.

[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:04.020]
Well, we thought so while Sonny likes taping it so that he can sit down and listen to it slowly.

[00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:04.400]
Ah.

[00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:07.160]
He and Grandma Boone can sit down and listen to it together.

[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:10.520]
And if he listens slowly and if he can comprehend what we're saying.

[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:12.520]
He's like, oh, I'm sorry.

[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:13.660]
I'm sorry.

[00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:16.720]
Bartlett Cloudy becoming breezy later, a small craft advice.

[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:18.080]
We're only going to a failure later.

[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:21.480]
Hi, today's 76, low to night 49.

[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.780]
And it's 54 at Zeta 4.

[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:24.840]
6.52.

[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.820]
And he found Hollywood Honda.

[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:28.220]
Yeah!

[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:31.160]
Now, let's hope the customers can find us.

[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:31.660]
Yeah.

[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:35.900]
Neil Rogers, the rock and roll monster.

[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:37.680]
654 on Zeta 4.

[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:42.080]
It's pretty easy to see who the people are on the air in this market, at least in the morning who are secure.

[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:49.400]
Well, I don't think secure is necessarily the right word, but who are not insecure, who are not bitten by this deep paranoia.

[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:50.600]
Am I right?

[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.260]
Those are the people who talk to us.

[00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:55.160]
And the people who like brush us off and have all these excuses.

[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:57.080]
Oh, we plan all our stuff ahead.

[00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:58.620]
We don't have time to talk to you.

[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.340]
It's all laid out like a road map.

[00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:02.360]
What the hell is that all about?

[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:05.360]
It sounded like it was kind of like a shot or something.

[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:06.400]
Like a shot?

[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:08.040]
I mean, the way he was slow.

[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.260]
I know, but it was.

[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:11.560]
It was a shot.

[00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:16.080]
That was the whole idea that he must have read that thing in South Florida magazine because Joey said the same thing.

[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:16.720]
Oh, yeah.

[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:20.720]
About how he sits for hours in the afternoon and writes out all this material.

[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:22.280]
You'd never know it.

[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:23.540]
Or listening to the show.

[00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:27.780]
Or maybe it's he listens to old tapes and gets all this material.

[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:28.560]
Is that possible?

[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:33.000]
Like from New York, maybe he listens to old Howard Stern and Scott Shannon tapes or something?

[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:33.820]
I'm his tapes.

[00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:39.900]
The thing about producing bits in advance or like before the show or the day before the show is a 90% of the time.

[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:42.700]
You know, the spontaneous stuff is much better.

[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:43.340]
Much funnier.

[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.280]
But something that's got all written on him.

[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:46.700]
It's got all laid out.

[00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:48.240]
And I guess probably sunny only.

[00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:51.700]
See, he does that in the afternoon and by that time he's tanked anyways.

[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:58.980]
The busy signal complex and if all the lines aren't lit, I cannot.

[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:00.620]
The show cannot go on.

[00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:01.460]
Where'd he get that idea?

[00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:04.460]
Have you heard him the last few days when pumping those numbers?

[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:05.260]
Yes, I have.

[00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:06.820]
Pumping them frantically.

[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:10.180]
He said early in the week it was going to be a numberless week.

[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.040]
He was not going to give the number all week.

[00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:13.520]
Within 20 minutes he was pumping it.

[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:17.800]
I'm saying here when one lousy call, I think we're going to talk about mixed marriage.

[00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:19.040]
And what's Kane doing now?

[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:19.920]
I'll do what he's doing.

[00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:21.800]
He did do that.

[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:22.360]
Yeah.

[00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:23.020]
He's got...

[00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:24.620]
Did you hear him call my answer machine yesterday?

[00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:30.740]
I've got sunshine on W-I-N-Z.

[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.340]
By the way, Jay's got a big party tonight.

[00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:34.300]
I don't know if that's a bullet line.

[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:40.340]
When there's a hurricane, blowin' baby, it's still the month of May.

[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:44.000]
We have any tickets left for the hurricane game this weekend in South Carolina?

[00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:46.820]
I guess you...

[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:47.940]
Yeah, he's ready to give him away.

[00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:48.360]
Look at that.

[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:54.260]
What can make me feel that way, stand-made joy?

[00:40:58.060 --> 00:40:59.140]
Talking about...

[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:00.200]
Who's that?

[00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:01.480]
Okay.

[00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:07.380]
The interesting part of it is people are calling stand-up and telling him that people are singing that song.

[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:09.380]
Like there's that... some movie.

[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.440]
Oh, three minute of baby.

[00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:12.140]
Is that it?

[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:17.860]
And people are breaking out and singing that because the song, my girl, is in the same name now.

[00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:24.460]
The guy said that he was at the movie theater watching three minute of baby and apparently Ted Danson sings my girl.

[00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:26.400]
And when they came to that...

[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.960]
The crowd started singing stand-made joy.

[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:31.700]
The only thing stand doesn't tell you is what were they're hearing it.

[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.180]
They're not hearing it on his show.

[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.340]
They're getting it on this show.

[00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:36.040]
Oh, he is.

[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:40.600]
Because he thinks my guy by Mary Wells is what the original song was anyway.

[00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:43.180]
So they're getting it from the day...

[00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:46.260]
Remember the day we played my girl by Smokey Robinson in America.

[00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:48.160]
I was in the... or the temptations, I'm sorry.

[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:48.980]
Same difference.

[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.580]
And we played this at the same time.

[00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:55.960]
We did that whole bit and we are the ones who put that jingle on the map.

[00:41:58.220 --> 00:41:59.220]
Ignore number three.

[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.480]
He just called to listen to the show on the phone.

[00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:03.780]
What the hell kind of a message is that?

[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:05.340]
Are you listening on hold?

[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:05.880]
Yes.

[00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:07.560]
What, what, what, do you have a radio?

[00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:08.700]
I radio upstairs.

[00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:10.560]
I'm an intensive care hospital.

[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:11.940]
Oh, okay, hold on.

[00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:12.780]

[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:12.880]

[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:16.960]
Did you hear him telling everyone yesterday that if you wanted...

[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.800]
If you send material to Neil...

[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:18.980]
Yes?

[00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:21.180]
That you're going to have to send a...

[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:21.460]
Oh, yeah.

[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:22.500]
A dub to him.

[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:23.320]
What, all that?

[00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:24.500]
What nonsense.

[00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:26.120]
Because he can't get in here anymore.

[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:29.120]
And there's some things he thinks would be good on this show.

[00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:33.100]
I told you the other day he's suffering from Neil's material withdrawal syndrome.

[00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:33.800]
Uh-huh.

[00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:36.260]
He cannot steal material in here.

[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:37.380]
And he doesn't know what to do now.

[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:38.840]
He doesn't know whether to scream or read a banana.

[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:42.340]
And I don't understand why, because he's got EJ doing stuff for him.

[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.420]
He's got Don Jr. doing stuff for him.

[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:46.820]
He's got Mike Wolf doing intros for him.

[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.200]
What does he need with our stuff?

[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:50.500]
It's another...

[00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:53.320]
He's got like two years of ACN stuff in his rack there.

[00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:55.860]
What is it that he needs besides an act?

[00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:57.060]
Besides a show.

[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:02.140]
There's something in this building if they can't...

[00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:03.780]
If they don't have access to this room.

[00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:04.040]
This room.

[00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:11.480]
I've got so much honey, there to be, there to be.

[00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:20.040]
He checks the mobile colors while he's smoking on a stokey.

[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:21.280]
Okay.

[00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:22.700]
Oh, you got a call.

[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:24.300]
You got a little...

[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:25.240]
You got a little...

[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:25.240]

[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:26.500]
A little grip, I think.

[00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:28.980]
704 on Zeta.

[00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:32.100]
And I guess we do the weather now, and then we got a little spark to do.

[00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:33.320]
And that would take a bunch more calls.

[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:34.700]
We're not going to play a lot of music today.

[00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:36.240]
I'm just not in the mood for music.

[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.820]
Even though we've been ordered.

[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:42.420]
According to Buddy Nevin's, one of America's great ure than lists.

[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:47.080]
We've been ordered to play lots more rock and roll music.

[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:50.440]
You know, this guy just makes it up as he goes along.

[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:51.540]
That you admitted that on the air?

[00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:52.920]
And I've admitted it on the air.

[00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:53.620]
I'm missing it.

[00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:57.220]
I wonder how that explains the fact that yesterday we played three records in four hours.

[00:43:57.780 --> 00:43:58.580]
I missed it.

[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:00.420]
And one of them was like a going home record.

[00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:01.460]
I mean, it was a good one.

[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:02.440]
It was filling off your freedom.

[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:02.720]
Yeah.

[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.340]
Going home record.

[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:04.580]
Yeah.

[00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:05.000]
You call that.

[00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:08.960]
Now Buddy Nevin's, was he Chad or Jethro?

[00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:12.800]
I always get confused when I see the show which one he played.

[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.860]
Yeah, he's a kind of Jethro doll.

[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:16.180]
Zeta forecast.

[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.540]
Partly cloudy, becoming breezy later.

[00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:20.940]
Just keep making it up, buddy.

[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:22.040]
A small crack.

[00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:25.720]
Today we admitted that we're leaving the air on the week from next circus.

[00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:26.220]
Okay?

[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:27.420]
You can put that in a paper.

[00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:29.000]
Hi, today's 76.

[00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:30.680]
Loaded like 49.

[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.760]
And we don't prepare the show ahead of time either.

[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:34.360]
We fly by the seat of your pants.

[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.640]
It's 54 degrees currently.

[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:38.480]
It's a to four, 705.

[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:39.260]
The following might be...

[00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:42.580]
Okay, it's a 706 on Zeta 4 that he'll run just show on a Friday morning.

[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:44.480]
And it's a low-hot Friday.

[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:45.140]
That's right.

[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.100]
I forgot about that.

[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:46.820]
I forgot.

[00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:49.460]
Joey had a great line a few days ago.

[00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:52.860]
I was driving home and Gonser was playing some obnoxious records.

[00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:53.480]
So I punched him.

[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:56.040]
Joey, it was the day that he stayed over that extra quarter hour.

[00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:58.160]
And he had...

[00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.120]
What did he call J. Michaels?

[00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:01.840]
He called him a quailude sucking homosexual.

[00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:03.540]
Good lord.

[00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:04.880]
And I'll be honest with you.

[00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:06.180]
I never knew about the quailudes.

[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:07.540]
Hey, Nail, this is Don Jr.

[00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:09.620]
I know you don't like my old man, pal.

[00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:11.360]
But hey, you're still a pal of mine.

[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:13.220]
Your numero uno, babe.

[00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:14.040]
And now...

[00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:16.680]
Here with a special Christmas message.

[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:18.820]
The immortal Elvis.

[00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:22.560]
All like he.

[00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:23.520]
Like a bourbon.

[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.500]
As here is the king.

[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:29.640]
I know I haven't been around for a while.

[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:32.620]
But I want you all to know what up here in Rock and Roll Heaven.

[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:34.960]
I'll be thinking of you because Christmas.

[00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:39.440]
And I'd like to give you all a special Christmas message.

[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:41.000]
A message of peace.

[00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:45.040]
Like, how about a little piece of that Thai called Bob?

[00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:46.200]
Like a robot.

[00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:51.440]
A lot of times I was saying Christmas is a time of hoot.

[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:52.620]
A time of joy.

[00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:53.940]
A time for love.

[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:55.720]
And I share with love.

[00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:57.480]
Take slots that's reaching you out there.

[00:45:58.300 --> 00:45:58.660]
I can.

[00:45:59.020 --> 00:45:59.480]
Hope we'll watch.

[00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:00.740]
No more water left.

[00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:01.860]
Oh yeah, Christmas.

[00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:04.960]
The Christmas to me means family.

[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:06.820]
If family means friends.

[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:08.800]
If friends means getting together.

[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:11.480]
And getting together means...

[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:11.660]
Eat?

[00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:14.000]
I'll pass me that term and say which please.

[00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:14.960]
I'll thank you.

[00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:15.540]
I'll give you one more.

[00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:18.920]
Now just walk straight to you right now.

[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:21.320]
You know I may be a big star.

[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:22.280]
Maybe too big.

[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:23.940]
But ain't nobody so big.

[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:25.480]
You can't reach out a help in a hand.

[00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:27.960]
Or a helping hand.

[00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:31.560]
Well, would you hand me a helping of those nice taters over there?

[00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:32.100]
Which I believe?

[00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:32.860]
Like it.

[00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:33.680]
Like it very much.

[00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:36.460]
Now I like how we're flaring them.

[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:38.000]
Ain't nobody so big you can.

[00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:40.460]
Stoop to help a friend of neat over the holidays season.

[00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:42.180]
Speaking of season,

[00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:44.040]
you won't pass me that soft sugar.

[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:44.680]
Can you get the chance?

[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:45.240]
Like it.

[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:47.140]
Yeah, just, just those screw the cover.

[00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:47.500]
That's right.

[00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:47.900]
Like it.

[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:49.880]
So this Christmas,

[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:52.600]
why don't y'all take a tip from old A.O.

[00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:53.140]
on us?

[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:55.900]
Now now I'll leave those stick tips right where they are.

[00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:56.440]
You know what I mean?

[00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:57.220]
No, I appreciate it.

[00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:57.580]
Thank you.

[00:46:58.180 --> 00:46:58.820]
But once you remember,

[00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:01.360]
we're all part of God's great big family.

[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:04.060]
And you know God made man into his own image.

[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:05.520]
And look at the mirror.

[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:07.780]
I have to say God must be a big,

[00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:09.140]
big sinner we're gonna do.

[00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:09.600]
You know what I mean?

[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:10.820]
I think you do.

[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:13.880]
But I especially want y'all to remember this one last thing.

[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.600]
You know all of whom is Christmas,

[00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:18.480]
stringing that popcorn up on the tree.

[00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:21.680]
Save a big, big bowl for the king.

[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:23.000]
Extra butter.

[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:23.440]
What am I?

[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:24.580]
I like your deer.

[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:25.740]
I like your deer.

[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:26.220]
I like your deer.

[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:29.440]
Is he eating on the air?

[00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:31.400]
I bet you sure you'll hold whatever nervous break to him.

[00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:34.380]
If she heard L of his eating on the air on Zeta 4.

[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:36.700]
Would that be disgusting or what?

[00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:40.820]
We've been flooded with people who enjoyed the two concert last night.

[00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:42.620]
We've had one call.

[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:46.260]
You know they spent the whole day on this station yesterday.

[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:49.360]
Just going ape over that YouTube concert and that Bono Vox.

[00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:52.720]
And I'm telling you, I mean you know some of their music is okay.

[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.300]
But I wouldn't get excited about them.

[00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:57.900]
I wouldn't walk from here to the edge of the fog to see you too.

[00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:58.280]
Right.

[00:47:58.680 --> 00:47:59.240]
I wouldn't.

[00:47:59.240 --> 00:47:59.540]
Would you?

[00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:02.900]
No, I enjoyed their music but I would not go to the orange bowl.

[00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:04.600]
That's not the kind of group you want to see first of all.

[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:05.400]
Like I said before.

[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:08.000]
No, the music's fine but I wouldn't go to the orange bowl.

[00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:09.260]
Or the sport of toy.

[00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:10.160]
I wouldn't go to any bowl.

[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:10.940]
Right.

[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:12.640]
To see that one should be good.

[00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:13.180]
Who's that?

[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:13.920]
The sting concert.

[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:14.820]
Sting ought to be excellent.

[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:15.460]
And the January.

[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:16.700]
And that's at the night center.

[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:18.960]
See I would go to the night center.

[00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:19.460]
Mm-hmm.

[00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:19.760]
Yeah.

[00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:20.520]
That's nice.

[00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:23.220]
Okay, here's every breath you take on Zeta 4 by the police.

[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:25.400]
Okay, let's go to date County.

[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:25.720]
Hello.

[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:27.760]
You be there?

[00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:31.920]
Okay, this caller either be illan or be going.

[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:32.720]
Yeah, see?

[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:33.760]
I told you they were still there.

[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:34.260]
Yes sir.

[00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:34.900]
Listen ill.

[00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:35.380]
Yeah.

[00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:36.260]
No, no, no.

[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:40.880]
What I do is I call you and I put the phone down and just listen on the radio and

[00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:43.240]
then you wait to find out if it's your turn.

[00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:43.720]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:46.800]
And just as you pick up the phone, I'm hanging it up, right?

[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:49.880]
Yeah, and I rush to the phone so you wouldn't hang up on me.

[00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:51.420]
I wouldn't do that too.

[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:52.580]
You sound like a great American.

[00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:54.100]
You have your reason.

[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:58.800]
I think when you call up the other radio station, that's probably one of the best parts in your show.

[00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:00.400]
It's pretty revealing though, isn't it?

[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:06.740]
To see which stations respond and have a good time with us and which ones are just testy and won't play the game.

[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:09.220]
Yeah, I wonder why people do that.

[00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:13.240]
They take a couple of minutes and at least you know, I'll talk to you at least.

[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:17.240]
I like this guy in 1-100 this morning telling me he's so busy and this and that.

[00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:18.500]
Yeah, that sunny box.

[00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:24.900]
And you have, have you called those dudes waxing up yet?

[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:25.700]
Yeah, I called.

[00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:26.420]
Didn't you hear that?

[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:27.380]
No, I didn't.

[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:27.620]
What happened?

[00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:32.040]
I called him about quarter to seven I think and I said, don't hang up.

[00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:36.320]
You have a said chance here and they started singing, don't hang up and they hung up.

[00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:39.500]
Yeah, well, it's not them.

[00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:40.880]
They're under a lot of pressure over there.

[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:44.020]
The management is just totally psychotic.

[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:45.880]
They are.

[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:46.600]
Very good.

[00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:51.120]
And when the next numbers come out in about 10 days, they're really, they're going to be an intensive therapy for weeks.

[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:54.300]
Hey, listen up. What about numbers now? How's your station doing?

[00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:55.300]
This one?

[00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:55.700]
Yeah.

[00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:58.880]
Well, we're on the up, we're on the upswing. Let's put it that way.

[00:49:59.020 --> 00:49:59.600]
On the upswing?

[00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:00.500]
Yeah. That's true.

[00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:01.320]
Of course, when you start.

[00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:03.640]
Because that's because you're the rock and roll monster.

[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:06.480]
When you start at zero, though, you have to go up. You can't go down.

[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:10.640]
Listen, man, it was a nice talking to you.

[00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:16.480]
Like, if you're my input, you're shows pretty good and I always come in in the morning as soon as I wake up.

[00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:19.420]
Well, that's good because that's what time it's on. So that's a good start.

[00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:20.260]
Okay, buddy.

[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:21.520]
Thanks a lot.

[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:22.800]
Boy boy.

[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:23.080]

[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:25.200]
Hey, that's starting to catch up.

[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:27.920]
Now Joey's going to accuse us of stealing that from him.

[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:31.240]
You know, if I was higher, higher, higher, then we turned that into boy boy.

[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:33.780]
Now ours is boy boy. He says, pretty close.

[00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:38.560]
It's like, you know, those lawsuits against George Harrison and all these other and Stevie Wonder.

[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:38.980]
Yeah.

[00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:43.160]
But I'm not concerned about that.

[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:46.260]
I would Stevie Wonder steal somebody else's material.

[00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:47.760]
Something to think about.

[00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:51.020]
Okay, we have it open. No, we don't. Boy, the lines are hot today.

[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:54.320]
A lot of ways we punch your buttons on Zeta 4. You know what I'm saying?

[00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:56.640]
I'm really getting choked up about it.

[00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:00.300]
Okay, let's move right along.

[00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:04.940]
He does have a big party tonight. I can't believe it. He was promoing it yesterday.

[00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:05.620]
That's right.

[00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:07.640]
And he is the party animal.

[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:10.200]
Oh, yeah. Well, he at least he admits it.

[00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:11.720]
Non-stop party guy.

[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:12.300]
Oh, yeah.

[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:14.760]
It's got that little boom box.

[00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:19.600]
I guess the big boom box he takes like the major events like if he's in the Orange Bowl or the Night Center.

[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:24.760]
And the little boom box is like to take to your house or, you know, the holiday in something like the Marriott.

[00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:26.240]
The Tupperware party.

[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:26.680]

[00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:28.240]
Dave, Dave County. Hello.

[00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:29.320]
Hello, man. Good morning.

[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:30.440]
Good morning to you.

[00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:32.360]
I wanted to tell you thanks. I got my cassette.

[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:33.020]
Great.

[00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:34.160]
Which was excellent.

[00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:36.660]
And I sent a copy out to Hawaii to my brother.

[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:37.180]
Beautiful.

[00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:38.780]
And he sent it back.

[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:40.960]
And said, I wouldn't let him listen to it.

[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:42.320]
Yeah.

[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:44.200]
Anyway, I got two now.

[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:46.420]
And I've also got my buttons from the bird.

[00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:48.520]
Beautiful. Well, it sounds like you're in good shape.

[00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:51.060]
Yeah, except let me tell you something about that Schuzzler stand.

[00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:53.880]
You know, he said right in send in material.

[00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:56.380]
Make a program. I'll send you a Pope T-shirt.

[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:59.300]
He stole my material and didn't send me a t-shirt.

[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:00.420]
You believe that?

[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:01.940]
Yes, I do.

[00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:03.800]
And I swear to God, he called up on it.

[00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:05.280]
And I called up the program guy over there.

[00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:07.560]
The switchboard and told me he was stealing my material.

[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:07.900]
Yeah.

[00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:09.100]
I got hung up on me.

[00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:13.720]
What? One of the worst freeloaders in the history of broadcasts in that state.

[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.900]
Who is the guy that's working the board over there?

[00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:17.300]
Not Kyle anymore.

[00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:18.220]
Oh, you mean Roland?

[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:19.540]
Oh, I don't know who he would.

[00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:21.700]
You know, there's, I have an interesting question about that.

[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:23.260]
His name is Bob Roland.

[00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:25.680]
And when he used to run the board for all of us,

[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:29.400]
we used to call him Bob, which is generally what you call people.

[00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:33.140]
You don't call him by their, for example, we don't, we didn't call Kyle Isley.

[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:34.440]
Hey, Isley, how you doing?

[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:37.140]
And now all of a sudden that he's become a superstar,

[00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:39.740]
he, they call him by his last name.

[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:42.380]
Hey, Roland, what's, what is that all about?

[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:43.100]
That's what he was.

[00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:43.860]
Why?

[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:45.940]
If you call him Bob, he gets all upset.

[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:46.320]
Why?

[00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:47.420]
I don't know.

[00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:47.820]
Roland?

[00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:48.600]
Roland?

[00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:49.560]
Roland?

[00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:49.940]
Roland?

[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:52.660]
Your CCR on Zeta 4.

[00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:54.880]
Did Bird, did you get my letter?

[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:55.980]
Which one?

[00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:58.760]
One, I left a dollar in for Birdseed.

[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:01.240]
Appreciate it.

[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:03.260]
No, anyway, I wrote you a letter.

[00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:04.340]
It was a long time ago.

[00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:06.640]
Listen, you know that Beaver song about the underwear?

[00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:07.120]
Yeah.

[00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:09.140]
I have a similar problem with a friend of mine.

[00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:11.240]
She's too embarrassed to go out and buy herself underwear.

[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:14.700]
And she's still wearing this stuff when I think she's about 14.

[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:15.740]
Believe that?

[00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:16.880]
Yeah, I do believe it.

[00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:19.120]
You don't want any putty that might be able to help her, maybe like,

[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:19.980]
stand or something?

[00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:22.540]
No, I think my roommate is big on girls' underwear.

[00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:25.360]
In fact, he was wearing some blue ones yesterday.

[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:26.100]
They were amazing.

[00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:27.940]
Anyways, with lace.

[00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:28.780]
I've got a real hang up.

[00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:30.060]
She didn't want to go in and buy anything.

[00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:31.380]
I've been trying to get her to do that.

[00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:34.760]
And I've tried to see in Joraz and Ducks on her butt all the time.

[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:36.920]
Well, you can buy them for her, can you?

[00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:38.380]
Oh, no, I'm too embarrassed to do that.

[00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:39.940]
Are you really?

[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:41.540]
Yeah, I don't even buy my own underwear.

[00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:43.140]
No, I didn't.

[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:46.560]
Anyway, maybe somebody's listening out there

[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:48.500]
to give me an idea of how to get her into a store.

[00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:50.200]
No, I got an idea for you.

[00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:50.900]
Why don't you buy them?

[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:52.100]
Yeah, whatever.

[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:53.660]
No, that didn't get on your underwear.

[00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:54.400]
Okay, I'm sorry.

[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:55.700]
No, just don't do it again.

[00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:56.540]
No, I won't.

[00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:57.280]
That's not usually me.

[00:53:57.340 --> 00:53:58.340]
That was the right word, though.

[00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:03.860]
Well, let me bring up one of the things, too, is that you're a friend.

[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:06.180]
Steve and man, you had to cut a tape for that guy.

[00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:07.000]
He's such a jerk.

[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:07.620]
Who's that?

[00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:12.040]
Eve, you know, he was calling you Mr. Dirty Mouth yesterday.

[00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:13.080]
Oh, yeah.

[00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:16.200]
Anyway, but you had to cut a little tape and tease him, man.

[00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:18.360]
He's so open for being a bad guy.

[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:18.800]
I don't know.

[00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:19.660]
It does.

[00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:21.480]
I mean, though, you're saying I love listening to you.

[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:23.280]
I'm sure I might, I could tease terrific.

[00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:23.640]
Hello.

[00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:24.180]
Hello.

[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:25.960]
You're okay.

[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:26.400]
I'm sorry.

[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:26.900]
That's right.

[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:28.880]
Okay, one last thought.

[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:32.540]
He was telling a guy how bad it is to give a little boy a gun

[00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:34.100]
and expose him to that.

[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:34.620]
Yeah.

[00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:37.800]
And I wonder what his daughter thought when he used to walk around the house

[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:39.600]
and they expose him to what he was.

[00:54:39.620 --> 00:54:40.960]
To that little pistol, yeah.

[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:42.140]
Thank you.

[00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:42.640]
It's worth it.

[00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:43.660]
All right.

[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:43.920]
Goodbye.

[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:45.060]
Okay, we'll go by.

[00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:45.880]
Oh, gee.

[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:47.200]
Isn't that interesting the way he said that?

[00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:51.020]
Like, um, all of a sudden, like, there are some people who are like that.

[00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:51.660]
In the morning.

[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:52.520]
Like you'd be talking.

[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:53.360]
No, not necessarily.

[00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:54.720]
You'd be talking everything is fine.

[00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:55.400]
And all of a sudden, goodbye.

[00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:55.940]
Oh, yeah.

[00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:56.400]
Yeah.

[00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:58.000]
Maybe he saw some things.

[00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.180]
You don't like this.

[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:00.400]
You don't like that.

[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:01.160]
I can't handle it.

[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:02.340]
You like them to back out.

[00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:02.560]
Yeah.

[00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:05.080]
I like them to just kind of like, slink out the door.

[00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:09.540]
Like, Alice, just kind of slink out of the door and keep like one foot

[00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:11.520]
on the other side of the line at all times.

[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:14.920]
17 past seven on Zeta 4 here in the Friday morning.

[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:16.700]
And that's a good idea.

[00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:17.820]
Are you still there?

[00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:18.260]
I'm here.

[00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:19.240]
Okay, hold on.

[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:20.820]
Okay, that's our caller.

[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:21.980]
And what are you laughing about?

[00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:24.100]
The guy is an intensive care for crying out loud.

[00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:25.100]
He wants to hear the show.

[00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:26.160]
Is that a laughing matter?

[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:26.760]
No.

[00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:28.520]
I'm glad we can help him.

[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:29.080]
You want to be ashamed of yourself.

[00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:31.640]
I was just just on general principle.

[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:32.760]
I'm not laughing at him.

[00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:34.860]
What are you laughing at?

[00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:35.760]
It was just funny.

[00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:37.800]
Just laughing at the life in general, right?

[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:38.220]
Exactly.

[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:39.660]
Boy, get you off the hook.

[00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:40.300]
Thank you.

[00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:41.220]
Broward County.

[00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:41.520]
Hello.

[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:44.000]
I know there's somebody there.

[00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:44.800]
I know you're there.

[00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:45.420]
I'm positive.

[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:46.860]
I've been serious dollars.

[00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:47.020]
Hello.

[00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:47.940]
See, I told you.

[00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:49.860]
How are you?

[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:51.140]
Hello, hello.

[00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:51.900]
Hello.

[00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:52.840]
Me.

[00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:53.680]
Yeah.

[00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:54.540]
Hi, goodness.

[00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:55.880]
Are you alright?

[00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:58.360]
I called from Bade and I called the Broward line.

[00:55:58.820 --> 00:55:59.280]
Oh, boy.

[00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:00.200]
You sound excited.

[00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:01.260]
I am.

[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:02.140]
You sound...

[00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:03.700]
I've been waiting to talk to you.

[00:56:03.740 --> 00:56:05.480]
You sound like all nervous and goosey now.

[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:06.060]
I am.

[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:07.840]
I've never talked on a radio before.

[00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:08.320]
Wow.

[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.700]
So how is it?

[00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:12.820]
It's great, I guess.

[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:13.980]
Yeah, it sounds good.

[00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:15.860]
You guys are great.

[00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:16.440]
I know.

[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:17.060]
I'm Boston.

[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:19.260]
This is the first time I've ever heard your show.

[00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:20.400]
Are you serial?

[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:21.460]
How long have you been here?

[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:22.920]
Oh, eight months.

[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:24.180]
Eight months.

[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:26.280]
And what the heck have you been listening to?

[00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:27.980]
I don't know.

[00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:28.600]
I guess.

[00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:29.480]
I don't know.

[00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:30.700]
All the dollars.

[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:31.740]
Do you know Scott and his year?

[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:34.900]
This must be Scott's sister.

[00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:36.300]
I don't know.

[00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:38.120]
It's quality rock and roll.

[00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:39.260]
Azzella for.

[00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:41.760]
Are you auditioning for your own show?

[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:43.900]
Oh, no, but I can come on yours.

[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:44.680]
How would that be?

[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:45.600]
That would be fine.

[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:46.140]
One day.

[00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:46.980]
One day.

[00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:47.540]
One day.

[00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:50.740]
One fine day.

[00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:52.520]
And here are the chiffons on Zeta 4.

[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:55.520]
Are you following any of this?

[00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:56.060]
Is it the chiffon?

[00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:57.600]
Yeah, do you remember the chiffons?

[00:56:58.100 --> 00:56:58.720]
Oh gosh.

[00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:00.200]
That must be before my time.

[00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:01.120]
Yeah, he's so fine.

[00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:03.760]
That was a record that George Harrison stole from my sweet lord.

[00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:05.300]
Is he fine?

[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:07.600]
I don't know, but I'd like to find out.

[00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:09.180]
Who are we talking about?

[00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:10.660]
Is chiffon?

[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:11.300]
Yeah.

[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:12.440]
I can't follow this.

[00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:13.080]
No, I don't either.

[00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:13.540]
I'm lost.

[00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:14.860]
Like, let me chiffon pie?

[00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:15.060]

[00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:16.300]
It's really in the morning for me.

[00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:17.920]
Or, shoe fly pie.

[00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:18.580]
Obviously.

[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:20.400]
It's too bad we didn't write all of this out.

[00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:23.640]
Can you imagine how good this call would be when you write it out?

[00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:25.400]
See, that's another thing I don't understand.

[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:27.700]
Sonny is when you're doing a talk show like we do.

[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:29.020]
How do you write it all out?

[00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:31.260]
I mean, the calls are spontaneous.

[00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:31.960]
You idiot.

[00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:33.460]
Not you, ma'am.

[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:34.100]
Just sunny.

[00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:35.380]
Sunny Fox.

[00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:36.960]
With a V.

[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:38.080]
I know, my goodness.

[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:41.720]
When you get up this early in the morning, how do you guys get up this early in the morning?

[00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:43.060]
You have such a sense of humor.

[00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:43.760]
Very easy.

[00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:47.020]
The alarm goes off and you get up and you bang it a couple of times.

[00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:49.980]
You jump out of bed, hop in the car, and here you are, like magic.

[00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:52.200]
102.7.

[00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:54.100]
I've opened up that for a second.

[00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:54.860]
Yes, they do.

[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:55.560]
You'd be amazed.

[00:57:56.380 --> 00:57:57.340]
I guess I would be.

[00:57:57.520 --> 00:57:57.700]
Yeah.

[00:57:57.880 --> 00:57:59.220]
Teach me how to do that someday.

[00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:00.280]
Oh, I don't think so.

[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:01.040]
I think you're barking.

[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:02.800]
I think you better listen to the show a little longer.

[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:08.560]
Okay, listen, have a wonderful weekend and call us again, okay?

[00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:09.540]
I sure will.

[00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:10.580]
Thank you much, Lee.

[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:11.140]
Bye-bye.

[00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:11.960]
Bye-bye.

[00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:12.480]
Okay.

[00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:13.480]
She was nice.

[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:14.020]
Oh, yeah.

[00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:17.960]
I have no idea what she was talking about, but I enjoyed the call of it.

[00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:19.260]
That's the kind of call we like a lot.

[00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:20.380]
Absolutely correct.

[00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:22.260]
7.20 now on Zeta 4.

[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:23.640]
Now we were talking about.

[00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:24.660]
You're about on this written out now?

[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:25.400]
Is it prepared?

[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:28.080]
Well, kind of.

[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:28.480]
Okay.

[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:33.180]
Yeah, we were talking about three men and a baby, the song with my girl and it that people

[00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:35.080]
in some theaters break.

[00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:36.600]
Yeah.

[00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:37.260]
Yeah.

[00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:38.060]
This one.

[00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:43.140]
Say, two, two, six, stay, I, Z.

[00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:47.920]
Well, the original, my girl is in this movie, Three Men and a Baby, which is the Ted

[00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:52.000]
Dance and Movie that some people in some theaters are breaking into the Stan Major song.

[00:58:52.140 --> 00:58:54.700]
And it is number one in the country, this film.

[00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:55.960]
What is the Stan Major song?

[00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:56.420]
Yeah.

[00:58:57.020 --> 00:58:58.420]
Well, that's number one here.

[00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:01.800]
Stan's not getting any calls and he's depressed about that, but when he finds out his

[00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:04.020]
song is number one, that'll make him feel a lot better.

[00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:07.900]
Well, three minute a baby is the number one film in the country.

[00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:12.720]
In its first five days of release, it sold nearly $14 million in tickets.

[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:17.440]
That's almost double the number two film, which is Cinderella, the re-release of the Walt

[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:18.740]
Disney animated classic.

[00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:20.240]
You know what we went to see last night?

[00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:22.140]
Plains, trains and automobiles?

[00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:23.780]
How did you know that?

[00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:24.940]
That's number three.

[00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:26.520]
Well, that's what we went to see.

[00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:28.360]
Steve Martin and John Dandy.

[00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:29.460]
Funny movie.

[00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:30.100]
Yeah.

[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:35.300]
Fatal attraction is edging its way out of this number four and last week's number one film,

[00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:38.300]
The Running Man with Arnold is number five.

[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:43.580]
Happy relatives gave thanks and Cuban prisoners played salsa music early today.

[00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:44.160]
Played what?

[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:45.300]
Salsa music.

[00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:46.120]
Salsa.

[00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:48.320]
Salsa, not Salsa.

[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:49.320]
Salsa.

[00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:53.240]
Salsa is what Tony Prego makes in the promotion office.

[00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:57.800]
Well, anyway, 89 hostages walked a freedom at the Atlanta federal pill and treasury.

[00:59:58.060 --> 00:59:59.380]
A group of relatives shot it.

[00:59:59.480 --> 00:59:59.800]
Thank God.

[00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:03.940]
Thank God as the first hostages emerged from 11 days of captivity.

[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.440]
Was that another ethnic slur when you said Salsa?

[01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:07.160]
No.

[01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:08.700]
Is it an atsugutta salsa?

[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:12.220]
That's what they say in a ragu plan in Rochester.

[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:15.280]
Partly cloudy becoming breezy later today with a hug.

[01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:17.900]
How about you didn't know they made ragu spaghetti sauce in Rochester, didn't you?

[01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:19.260]
I never had thought about that.

[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:20.000]
You know, it's weird.

[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.100]
I'd never thought about that.

[01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:23.760]
I'd be 76, but I'd be 49.

[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:24.680]
It freezes though.

[01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:27.140]
54 at Zeta Ford.

[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:28.700]
Why buy it from a youth?

[01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:34.560]
In accordance with the new FCC guidelines, this station will broadcast material characterized

[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:39.200]
as indecence only between the hours of midnight and 6 a.m.

[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:40.880]
The time at the tone.

[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:44.040]
12 midnight.

[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:48.240]
He's the first kid on the block.

[01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:49.100]
First kid.

[01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:51.300]
And he gets up right and early.

[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:52.060]
Right and early.

[01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:54.140]
Well, you know he's a little nutty.

[01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:55.000]
Got him a nutty.

[01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:56.980]
And you know he's a little squirrely.

[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:57.800]
Got him squirrely.

[01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:02.240]
Well, he peaks at you through the hole in the record just to say hello.

[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:05.580]
Hi, I can see what you're all doing out there.

[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:09.060]
In the morning, I'm Zeta Ford radio.

[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:11.440]
It's the new Roger show.

[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:13.060]
Good morning, Neil.

[01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:15.140]
26 after 7 on Zeta Ford.

[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:16.020]
The sun is shining.

[01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:18.260]
It looks just like a repeat of yesterday.

[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:19.840]
The fog has burned off.

[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:20.480]
Yes.

[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:21.080]
Am I right?

[01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:24.640]
Not a cloud that is a little bit of it like hovering out there with the Rick Edwards

[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:25.320]
and the tower.

[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:29.820]
But other than that, it's burned off and it looks like yesterday all over again, a little

[01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:31.160]
crisp going to be a great day.

[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:32.280]
Good day to wash a car.

[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:33.060]
Is it?

[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:34.900]
Great day to wash a car.

[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.320]
I thought it'd be a good day to move furniture.

[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:39.300]
No, that was yesterday.

[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:39.980]
Oh, you did.

[01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:41.620]
And yesterday was a good day to wash a car too.

[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:43.340]
I did not wash the cars, by the way.

[01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:45.960]
But you did someone else wash the cars.

[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:46.900]
They had times.

[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:52.520]
Exerted enormous physical energy and they did a very good job, by the way.

[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:52.800]
Wow.

[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:54.000]
So that's a step into right direction.

[01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:54.860]
I guess.

[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:58.680]
Of course, that was after I had moved 400 pounds of furniture, but you know, little things.

[01:01:58.780 --> 01:01:59.280]
How's your back?

[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:00.740]
My back is out.

[01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:02.000]
26 after 7.

[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:05.580]
My back is hurting after what they've been saying about me at Y100, no.

[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:07.500]
Shame on them.

[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:09.960]
OK, let's dig into my pocket.

[01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:10.480]
I like this.

[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:14.520]
Just like reaching into your pants pocket, you've got all these little slips of paper.

[01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:16.020]
I like Captain Kangaroo.

[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:18.520]
I feel this like Mr. Green Genius.

[01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:19.180]
I know.

[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:21.820]
And you got all these weird numbers on them.

[01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:22.680]
Not Daffy.

[01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:24.020]
We didn't get to call her yesterday.

[01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:25.380]
Are you going to call Daffy?

[01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:26.420]
Oh, this one.

[01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:27.680]
The best.

[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:29.680]
No.

[01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:30.260]
Oh.

[01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:34.400]
What the hell would I talk to her about?

[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:40.500]
It's very difficult to be a suit at 730 in the morning, I don't understand.

[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:43.460]
OK, here we go, boys and girls.

[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:44.960]
You could talk to her about.

[01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:45.860]
You could talk to her about.

[01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:47.300]
Reagan Gorbachev, sub-it.

[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:47.680]
Yeah.

[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:52.280]
Hi, this is Steve Parham, the new program director of Y100.

[01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:55.000]
Nice to call you the Y100, listen line.

[01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:55.560]
OK.

[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.880]
With your input, we're going to make Y100 even better.

[01:02:59.140 --> 01:02:59.320]
Wow.

[01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:00.520]
Please leave your comment.

[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:02.500]
You have 30 seconds.

[01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:03.320]
Yeah.

[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.740]
Y100, listen to you.

[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:07.840]
Boy, come on, Steve.

[01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:08.400]
Where's the beef?

[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:09.580]
Hey, Steve.

[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:10.060]
How are you doing?

[01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:11.580]
This is Neil Rogers again at Zeta Ford.

[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:13.140]
I'm sorry to call you two days in a row.

[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:16.140]
But about that sunny fox, what's with sunny?

[01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:18.740]
I mean, it's one thing to be prepared and have everything written up.

[01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:21.600]
But what's wrong with sunny?

[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:22.680]
Doesn't he have a sense of humor?

[01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:23.600]
He loves my show.

[01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:24.300]
He loves me.

[01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:25.280]
He tapes the show.

[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:26.520]
He steals my material.

[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:28.640]
Straighten sunny out.

[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.420]
Will you please tell him to speak to us?

[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:32.060]
Tell him we could have a wonderful relationship.

[01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:32.800]
You know what I mean?

[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:33.840]
He...

[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:35.140]
by-steed.

[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:35.500]
Ah!

[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:36.820]
OK.

[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:40.260]
Now there's a hell of a suggestion for the...

[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:41.160]
Yeah.

[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:42.600]
Straighten sunny out.

[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:44.140]
I don't know why.

[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.520]
I think Y100 even better.

[01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:46.760]
I can't believe he didn't talk to us.

[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:48.580]
I mean, the guy came on and sounded so friendly.

[01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:49.520]
He loves you.

[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:51.020]
These people are so uptight.

[01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:52.080]
They have no sense of humor.

[01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:53.900]
They have no sense of adventures, some of them.

[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:56.360]
Now, Sonny, you ain't into sunny at the dentist, boss.

[01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:58.380]
Sonny loves this show.

[01:03:58.780 --> 01:03:59.400]
He's a groupie.

[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:00.040]
He's one of my...

[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:00.220]
I know.

[01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:01.220]
Main groupies.

[01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:04.080]
We used to have to bade him from the age of college.

[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:07.600]
He shook my hand so many times that I felt like I had been doing aerobics when I left the

[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:08.280]
dentist office.

[01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:10.280]
That's a true story.

[01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:10.880]
Oh, let's see.

[01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:11.300]
There was the...

[01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:12.640]
Of course he'd do it in the dentist office, I wonder.

[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:14.020]
Getting a new mouth.

[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:16.900]
I was saying there's a power 96.

[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:18.960]
Now, what happened to the number for she?

[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:20.500]
Did I lose that?

[01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:21.440]
Are you going to cost me?

[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:21.860]
You think...

[01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:24.020]
I think it'd be pushing it to call him again today, don't you?

[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:24.200]

[01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:27.840]
And he might be upset that somebody we know used that on the year.

[01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:29.080]
I don't know.

[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:30.500]
He might be upset about that.

[01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:32.560]
I wouldn't blame him because it wasn't...

[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:35.080]
In other words, he wasn't doing material for the Stan Major show.

[01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:35.360]
Really?

[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:37.880]
Well, I know that comes as a shock to Stan.

[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:40.120]
That's what I thought it was.

[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:42.340]
I almost did something terrible there.

[01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:47.340]
But anyway, he was doing it just in response to our call and he was a good caller.

[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:48.020]
Oh, he was great.

[01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:49.060]
He was.

[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:49.800]
He was great.

[01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:50.840]
Excellent.

[01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:53.840]
Maybe through a couple of shots, not at us.

[01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:55.340]
Let's take a shot at Stan.

[01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:55.640]
Stan.

[01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:56.500]
At Stan.

[01:04:57.620 --> 01:05:00.000]
Now I know why I like that call so much.

[01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:02.400]
It finally rings a bell.

[01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:08.540]
At Stan Major disease, look out for it ladies and gentlemen.

[01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:10.300]
It's creeping through the building in Zeta 4.

[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:11.120]
Stan Major.

[01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:16.420]
Talking about Stan Major.

[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:18.560]
7.30 on Zeta 4.

[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:24.720]
Don't forget Jay Michaels on AM on WINZ today is going to be having his own Tupperware party on the air.

[01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:32.020]
It's a radio first ladies and gentlemen by Tupperware over the air on WINZ today.

[01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:35.540]
And it's going to be great when they have those things burped on the air.

[01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:40.100]
Are they going to can you buy any of those little specimen things?

[01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:44.640]
I bet you that Sherry Hall would have a nervous breakdown if we were burping Tupperware on the air back there.

[01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:46.340]
Can you imagine how that would sound in stereo?

[01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:48.460]
I bet you would sound pretty good.

[01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:52.780]
Yeah, we can have like two of them and you could burp one over there and I'll burp one over here.

[01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:57.560]
Or if we get some of that TJ cinnamon's in here this morning, we could just burp our shell.

[01:05:58.080 --> 01:05:59.280]
Boy, that's great stuff.

[01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:01.800]
Yeah, we haven't had any food coming here in a long time.

[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:07.560]
And it's only 7.30 now, which means we still have a good solid hour to get those cheeseburgers in here.

[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:11.880]
What are you making cuttable sounds?

[01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:14.980]
You don't believe that one day we're going to get cheeseburgers in here?

[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:21.560]
I'm telling you, if I could do it in Albion, Michigan, like 22 years ago,

[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.080]
then why the hell can't we do it here?

[01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:23.980]
It's possible.

[01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:26.900]
Some homemade ones, I think, is the only way you're going to get them in here.

[01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:30.680]
Oh, yeah, I'm going to really eat homemade meat in this market, right?

[01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:33.900]
Keep all your homemade meat at home, all right?

[01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:35.680]
We can call Jamie and Barcy.

[01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:38.500]
Yeah, there we go. We can have cheeseburgers Parmesan.

[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:41.000]
That sounds really good to me.

[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:43.800]
I think I'll bring up what calls, perhaps, State County.

[01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:47.060]
Hello. Hello. I think they're gone.

[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:48.360]
I can always tell.

[01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:49.140]
Oh, yeah, I know.

[01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:51.100]
I trust that ear implicitly.

[01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:51.340]
Well, Neil?

[01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:51.960]
Yes, sir.

[01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:52.840]
What's up, bud?

[01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:53.880]
Hey, how you doing?

[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:56.000]
Just enough. I'd like to ask you something.

[01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:59.920]
When you play at stand majors songs, it sounds so much better.

[01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:02.760]
I mean, so much better when you sing along with it.

[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:03.260]
Oh, yeah?

[01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:05.520]
Yeah. We can't sing, sir.

[01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:07.760]
I think you guys can.

[01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:11.280]
Well, I'm always on key, but somebody in the room we won't mention any name.

[01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:14.660]
Somebody is always way off key.

[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:18.320]
I mean, seriously, when you play that, could you do me a favor?

[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:21.280]
In fact, in fact, Steve, when he goes stand majors.

[01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:24.240]
Steve, he wondered how an album about his performance.

[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:26.060]
It's called Songs in the Key of Flight.

[01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:26.560]
Flight?

[01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:30.400]
As in Big Bird?

[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:32.940]
What, what? Big Bird?

[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:37.540]
Do I feel like we have an echo on the show today or something?

[01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:40.160]
No, no, I'm not understanding you.

[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:41.480]
That's the idea.

[01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:44.800]
Well, listen, I like that question.

[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:48.740]
Who makes these, these big volume beaver skits?

[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:49.680]
Who makes them up?

[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:50.680]
Yeah, who makes them up?

[01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:52.280]
Tony Dow and the Clint Eastwood.

[01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:55.160]
Tony Dow, because that is pretty good.

[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:57.460]
Yeah, they're a number nowadays.

[01:07:57.720 --> 01:07:58.780]
You know that Tony and the Clint?

[01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:00.960]
That they're a number?

[01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:01.440]
Yeah.

[01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:03.460]
Like how do you mean they're a number?

[01:08:03.740 --> 01:08:04.460]
Like a number.

[01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:06.160]
Like picking up from 1 to 100.

[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:08.960]
Like maybe 69?

[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:09.880]
Yeah, okay.

[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:11.240]
That's the number.

[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:17.220]
Okay, so I just want to call that, if you could sing along with them, because that...

[01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:18.440]
Okay, next time, okay?

[01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:19.180]
Yeah, okay.

[01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:20.660]
So we'll see you later.

[01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:21.080]
Okay.

[01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:22.180]
Bye-bye.

[01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:24.140]
Call my answering machine.

[01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:25.860]
This fits right in with that call.

[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:26.920]
Would you?

[01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:30.740]
Well, now I'm going to debate whether I should call you or whether I should call...

[01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:31.580]
10-Major!

[01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:32.640]
That's...

[01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:36.700]
My answering machine will fit right into that life.

[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.340]
You notice I did dump that.

[01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:40.220]
So did it.

[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:40.560]
So did it.

[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:41.780]
Yes, should I appreciate that?

[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:45.720]
Mager!

[01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:48.340]
Talking about...

[01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:48.960]
Mager!

[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:50.720]
Mager!

[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:51.200]
Say, Mager!

[01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:54.980]
How does that sound good when I sing on this, doesn't it?

[01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:55.500]
Oh!

[01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:57.100]
Gee!

[01:08:59.180 --> 01:08:59.660]
Wow.

[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:03.100]
It's like the whole world is losing their minds now, you know?

[01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:05.960]
And he thinks he's responsible for that.

[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:11.560]
That's what he's upset about, because he knows damn well that I'm the one that's got everybody going around seeing Stan Mager.

[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:13.220]
It just keeps running through my head.

[01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:14.100]
I know, I can't...

[01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:17.760]
I was obsessed at one time with the Joey Reynolds team, remember?

[01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:18.660]
This is replaced.

[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:19.860]
Don't you think?

[01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:22.460]
In fact, just to refresh your memory.

[01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:22.900]
Oh!

[01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:23.960]
Okay, great.

[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:25.960]
Allo Gary Lawrence, I think, is out of town.

[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:27.260]
Isn't he seen in New York?

[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:28.060]
Yes.

[01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:29.700]
I love to play this what he's in town.

[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:31.680]
But that isn't very often.

[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:37.680]
Joey Reynolds, Joey Reynolds!

[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:42.940]
And when I first got this, when they first sent me the scratchy old record from WXYZ,

[01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:45.560]
you'll recall that I was obsessed.

[01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:45.900]
Oh!

[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:49.820]
And I can't play it over and over again, but it ran its course.

[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:50.860]
It was great.

[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:54.000]
But the thing about that J-Michael's jingle, man, it just...

[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:54.880]
It grows on you.

[01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:56.720]
It just cannot get enough of it.

[01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:57.340]
That's right.

[01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:00.520]
And it just stays great.

[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:00.980]
Yeah.

[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:02.360]
Never burns out.

[01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:03.860]
It's marvelous.

[01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:04.400]
Yeah.

[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:07.300]
735, I'd say to four, we're going to do a commercial break.

[01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:08.500]
Now, let me refresh my memory.

[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:09.860]
Have we played any music today?

[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:10.280]
No.

[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:12.000]
I know we've been ordered.

[01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:15.080]
The rumor is from what's his name over there at Goodwill.

[01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:17.060]
Oh!

[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:19.140]
We've been ordered.

[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:21.060]
We've been ordered to play a lot more rock and roll.

[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:22.980]
Buddy Nevin's is he working at Goodwill?

[01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:26.060]
Or is he eating at Goodwill?

[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:26.720]
One or the other.

[01:10:27.340 --> 01:10:30.860]
In fact, if you saw him in here that morning, I think he dressed his from Goodwill.

[01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:33.500]
Says very heavy traffic on South Bend.

[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:35.080]
Okay, I certainly will.

[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:42.300]
It's 23 till late on Zeta 4, as we continue to set new trends in radio broadcasting from coast to coast.

[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:42.780]
That's correct.

[01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:46.120]
And one of the new parts of our format is sneezing.

[01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:50.280]
Man, you are just wheezing and choking and puking.

[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:51.020]
I don't know what it is.

[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:51.980]
It seems to be going around.

[01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:52.860]
I feel fine.

[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:53.300]
Do you?

[01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:54.840]
You look like Helen a handbag's coming.

[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:56.500]
Well, why should today be a handbag?

[01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:58.040]
You look like we're off the red nose bird.

[01:10:58.280 --> 01:10:58.760]
Is it red?

[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:00.140]
It's red as a beet.

[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:03.320]
In fact, it matches your microphone cozy.

[01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:04.240]
It does today.

[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:04.900]
It really does.

[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:05.960]
But I'm alright.

[01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:06.360]
It's getting better.

[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:07.000]
Broward Coddy.

[01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:07.240]
Hello.

[01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:08.800]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:12.100]
Okay, why is it like the beginning of every call the levels are so low?

[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:12.780]
Have you noticed that?

[01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:13.740]
Go ahead, sir.

[01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:14.440]
It's not your fault.

[01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:16.340]
I got to turn my levels up, how's that?

[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:17.840]
It's our Mickey Mouse phone system.

[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:18.720]
It's Japanese.

[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:19.660]
You know how it goes.

[01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:19.980]
Yeah.

[01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:21.140]
Hey, Neil.

[01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:24.740]
I need four adults to turn your levels up.

[01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:26.920]
Just a little bit of my moniker broke last night.

[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:28.040]
Okay, how's this?

[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:28.640]
A little better?

[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:31.920]
I heard that pool last night.

[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:34.800]
Yesterday when he came on, I couldn't believe that.

[01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:35.800]
Which pool was that?

[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:37.900]
The guy you'd been having problems with.

[01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:39.320]
Oh, that idiot, yeah.

[01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:40.820]
Yeah, yeah.

[01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:42.860]
I was talking with Stan yesterday and he says,

[01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:44.380]
I don't worry about that idiot.

[01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:46.060]
Yeah, don't worry about that idiot.

[01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:46.880]
I'm bird.

[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:47.800]
Yes, sir.

[01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:52.020]
I asked Stan yesterday that since you're both sharing the office

[01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:54.120]
if you're changing the paper a little more regular.

[01:11:57.100 --> 01:11:58.300]
I just wanted to come.

[01:11:58.620 --> 01:11:59.600]
I had a good morning, guys.

[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:01.480]
I was first my bed office morning.

[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:02.340]
I'll bet you the night.

[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:04.600]
On your motorcycle?

[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:06.360]
That was a good day and we'll talk to you in a little bit.

[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:08.040]
Okay, I'll still a little bit ago.

[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:08.840]
I'll put them back in.

[01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:09.840]
Audio is okay.

[01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:11.300]
I was trying to ask him something there,

[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:13.100]
but he was just zooming right on ahead.

[01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:14.640]
That's how those motorcycle people are.

[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:14.900]
Yeah.

[01:12:15.340 --> 01:12:17.140]
Okay, now God's just going to be doing a show

[01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:19.000]
from a biker bar today at 10 o'clock.

[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:21.760]
That ought to be really exciting.

[01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:24.260]
I'm looking forward to it.

[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:27.800]
As a matter of fact, I'm supposed to promote Mr. Mung,

[01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:30.720]
our program director, had a note that I somehow misplaced.

[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:31.160]
Really?

[01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:32.400]
Imagine how I did that.

[01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:34.680]
I was supposed to mention that it's Friday,

[01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:36.940]
so Gondra will be at the comic strip tonight.

[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:37.480]
That's right.

[01:12:37.780 --> 01:12:37.920]
Right?

[01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:38.660]
Every Friday.

[01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:39.060]
Big deal.

[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:40.600]
Okay, now that's just a joke.

[01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:42.200]
Okay, just a little inside joke.

[01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:43.480]
Tonight.

[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:44.620]
Friday.

[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:45.080]
Yeah.

[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:45.980]
Is that tonight?

[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:46.360]
Yeah.

[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:48.540]
Okay, let's take a call from Dave County

[01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:49.580]
and I know that they're there.

[01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:49.880]
Hello.

[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:51.300]
Yeah, man, what it is.

[01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:52.160]
See, I told you.

[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:52.540]
Oh, yeah.

[01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:53.160]
How you be?

[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:53.940]
Yeah.

[01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:56.380]
That's your call, Sweet Baby Blue Stormy,

[01:12:56.420 --> 01:12:57.220]
let me talk to you.

[01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:57.980]
Sweet Baby Blue?

[01:12:58.600 --> 01:12:59.160]
Yeah, man.

[01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:00.740]
You know what time it is out there now?

[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:03.380]
It's like 20 to 5 in the morning.

[01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:05.520]
Not only that, we can't put two people on together here.

[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:06.200]
Just Dondra.

[01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:06.780]
That's right.

[01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:07.360]
That's right.

[01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:10.100]
You don't have to call her in a long time.

[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:10.740]
I know.

[01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:12.000]
You'll have to call her.

[01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:13.300]
Direct.

[01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:14.320]
Do you want her number?

[01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:15.360]
Yeah, man.

[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:16.880]
What it is?

[01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:18.220]
Okay, it is.

[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:19.500]
I just chill out.

[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:19.920]
Would you please?

[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:21.880]
It's an area code 213.

[01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:23.920]
You got that?

[01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:24.920]
Yeah.

[01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:26.920]
976.

[01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:30.800]
Is this guy?

[01:13:32.060 --> 01:13:32.400]
4257.

[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:33.740]
All right, man.

[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:36.360]
Okay, you better call right away because I gave it on the year.

[01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:37.300]
I didn't to dump it out.

[01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:38.380]
So you better get in there.

[01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:39.220]
They're going to be mobbed.

[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:40.320]
All right, man.

[01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:40.840]
You all right.

[01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:41.360]
Okay.

[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:42.500]
Bye, boy.

[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:45.020]
Okay, that's the number for Sweet Blue.

[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:48.000]
That's that, um, I don't want to say phone sex.

[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.120]
That's what it is.

[01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:49.640]
Sure.

[01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:50.640]
No, don't say that.

[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:51.980]
That's a live phone sex.

[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:53.060]
That's grotesque.

[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:54.040]
But that's what it is.

[01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:54.980]
What would you call it?

[01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:55.320]

[01:13:56.340 --> 01:13:57.680]
What would you call it?

[01:13:58.620 --> 01:13:59.540]
But I liked her.

[01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:00.240]
She was funny.

[01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:00.780]
Yeah.

[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:01.560]
She was excellent.

[01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:02.260]
Uh-huh.

[01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:03.360]
Ah, this sweet baby blue.

[01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:05.520]
In fact, she was good, but our caller is wrong.

[01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:06.000]
More on.

[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:06.280]
Right.

[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:08.860]
I was hot, horny young guys who were calling in.

[01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:09.320]
If free now.

[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:12.220]
You know, we'd get her on the phone with them and they wouldn't know whether to scream or eat a banana.

[01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:13.480]
They did not know what to do.

[01:14:17.380 --> 01:14:18.940]
Jeff Stryker's number is disconnected.

[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:19.540]
Yeah.

[01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:21.920]
It's not like it used to be.

[01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:23.320]
No, the old days were.

[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:24.480]
Those were the good old days.

[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:25.800]
The last summer.

[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:27.600]
You know, one of those hot numbers on the phone, man.

[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:29.000]
Now it's really desperate.

[01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:30.440]
We're not just going up.

[01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:30.800]
Oh!

[01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:32.960]
Baby, I smile, oh, today.

[01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:35.480]
Well, you don't step on the village people, are you?

[01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:38.140]
They can do nasty things to you.

[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:39.280]
You know, cross them.

[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:41.060]
You're mad at me, you are.

[01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:43.080]
Don't run up, you're alone.

[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:44.400]
You're just a girl.

[01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:45.600]
I'll only remember.

[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.040]
Hello, my friend.

[01:14:51.380 --> 01:14:52.680]
What's your credit card number?

[01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:53.340]
36.

[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:55.900]
What's your phone number?

[01:14:57.240 --> 01:14:57.840]
1666.

[01:14:58.500 --> 01:14:59.160]
What's your fantasy?

[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:00.900]
You're very hot.

[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:02.200]
We'll call you back.

[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:03.100]
Thank you.

[01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:04.520]
Over the phone.

[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:06.360]
You know, I like it.

[01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:06.800]
Hey.

[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:08.580]
Over the phone.

[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:12.000]
You know, when you go out into large crowds,

[01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:13.740]
like in a shopping mall at this time of the year,

[01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:15.280]
when there are enormous numbers of people,

[01:15:15.820 --> 01:15:17.280]
and you start looking around,

[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:19.360]
you realize that with most of them,

[01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:20.400]
this would be the best way.

[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:22.520]
Seriously.

[01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:26.800]
Over the phone, when you can't see them,

[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:28.160]
like over the radio.

[01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:29.740]
Kind of like listening to Bano Vag.

[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:31.440]
You don't have to see his face.

[01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:34.080]
I don't care not at all.

[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:35.680]
Oh, that's a call for me.

[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:36.020]
Back.

[01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:39.060]
Come on.

[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:40.100]
Bano Vag.

[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:43.220]
It's me, you're the only one to see.

[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:44.140]
Oh, what's it?

[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:45.480]
Okay.

[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:48.480]
Just care about my body.

[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:50.560]
Oh, that's a good one.

[01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:52.920]
I love Bano Vag.

[01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:56.800]
Oh, my, oh, is it all?

[01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:58.360]
Is it all?

[01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:00.960]
Okay, those are going to be the special guests

[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:03.040]
on the lead Gillette show this afternoon on Zeta,

[01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:03.880]
the Village People.

[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:05.200]
Can't you see,

[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.900]
you lead Gillette interviewing the Village People?

[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:08.260]
Not really.

[01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:09.580]
No, it just doesn't fit.

[01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:10.840]
So to speak.

[01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:13.420]
It's 18 before 8 on Zeta 4,

[01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:14.260]
then you'll watch your show.

[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:16.360]
What the hell is that Steve Kane talking about anyway?

[01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:19.320]
You know that every time another one of these stupid articles comes out

[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:22.680]
or there's another development in that stupid ongoing soap opera,

[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:24.840]
right away he's there to try to exploit it,

[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:26.800]
because he's another guy who's got absolutely no show.

[01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:30.320]
And he's talking about calling me Mr. Pottymouth

[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:31.760]
or whatever, at least a ledge,

[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:33.260]
because I don't listen to him at all.

[01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:33.920]
No, I don't need him.

[01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:36.380]
Anymore, and I don't listen to Alice anymore.

[01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:38.000]
So I don't know what Stan's bitching about,

[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:39.860]
because he may not be getting a lot of calls,

[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:41.540]
but he's got no competition.

[01:16:41.660 --> 01:16:43.080]
There's nothing else to listen to.

[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:44.120]
Is the only thing I was zero.

[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:44.940]
It's Stan.

[01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:45.320]
Yeah.

[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:46.840]
It's the only thing to listen to in the afternoon.

[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:48.540]
My radio is either on, I'll put it this way.

[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:50.080]
If I'm in a car, it's either on Stan,

[01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:52.540]
on FM listening to music,

[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:55.000]
hopefully this station except when we're playing CCR,

[01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:56.980]
or in the off position, right?

[01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:58.740]
Those are the only three options.

[01:16:58.980 --> 01:17:00.420]
I never think of any of the,

[01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:00.760]
no.

[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:01.240]

[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:04.280]
No, because they're still doing that same tired old crap

[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:06.460]
that is beyond passé.

[01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:09.620]
Kane had Jack Sturdy on the other day, so I mean,

[01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:11.080]
you know, what does that tell you?

[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:12.020]
That's exciting.

[01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:15.660]
Did he have Bill Crawford on at the same time?

[01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:18.600]
Bill Crawford was on Jeff Charles show, that day.

[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:19.280]
Oh, God.

[01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:20.200]
And then at two,

[01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:21.960]
how about George Kempel?

[01:17:22.020 --> 01:17:22.700]
Was he on with Alice?

[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:23.340]
No.

[01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:24.380]
No.

[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:24.940]
I know.

[01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:26.460]
How about Don Stutter?

[01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:27.260]
Who?

[01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:28.340]
I better not mention his name.

[01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:29.000]
He'll call in.

[01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:30.320]
You know Stutter.

[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:31.120]
He's letting say,

[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:33.640]
he doesn't take much provocation and right away he's on the phone.

[01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:34.100]
That's right.

[01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:36.440]
Talking about those pictures.

[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:39.580]
Speaking of pictures, by the way.

[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:40.360]
Yes.

[01:17:40.820 --> 01:17:41.060]
Hmm.

[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:43.600]
I guess I'm going to be seeing an old friend of yours sometime this weekend.

[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:45.680]
And I wonder if I should ask her about those.

[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:46.860]
What about them?

[01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:48.300]
About those intimate photographs?

[01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:49.600]
We didn't do those.

[01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:50.400]
You didn't do them yet.

[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:51.320]
You didn't take, yet?

[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:52.560]
No, we're not going to do them.

[01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:53.060]
Why not?

[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:54.520]
And then you never say never.

[01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:56.720]
Always keep your options open.

[01:17:57.980 --> 01:17:58.380]
Okay.

[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:01.180]
I just didn't think it was a good idea.

[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:02.740]
It was just a...

[01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:04.200]
Do we want to tell the audience what it was?

[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:07.080]
Is it between midnight and six?

[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:08.780]
No, okay, well we can't.

[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:09.840]
Okay, they're intimate.

[01:18:10.540 --> 01:18:11.100]
Let's leave it at that.

[01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:11.660]
Entomans?

[01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:14.000]
No, tell Stan that man, he's a liar.

[01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:15.120]
Entomans.

[01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:17.740]
Now I think maybe that's what's affecting his show.

[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:19.000]
I don't think he's eating as much.

[01:18:19.140 --> 01:18:20.300]
Entomans is he used to.

[01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:22.700]
I think that's probably what the big problem is.

[01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:26.180]
Also, if my good friends at Windixie up in plantation

[01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:28.040]
up in Jacaranda or Square are listening,

[01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:30.660]
I know you guys have got a good sense of humor,

[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:33.720]
but these 95-year-old bag boys have got to go.

[01:18:33.980 --> 01:18:34.460]
Yeah, okay.

[01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:37.500]
That's not an ultimatum, but they got to go.

[01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:38.940]
Or I'm going to go up to publics.

[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:40.580]
Dave County, hello.

[01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:42.560]
Are you there?

[01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:43.640]
Nope.

[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:44.860]
They're there.

[01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:45.760]
There's somebody there.

[01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:46.540]
They're down about it.

[01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:48.120]
Yes, sir.

[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:49.120]
Hey, dude, how you doing?

[01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:50.360]
Okay, Cougar.

[01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:53.320]
I always get to use two cons real last night.

[01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:54.320]
Hey, here's another one.

[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:57.060]
You're our second U2 official auto, and how was it?

[01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:59.160]
I was under squirrel, we great.

[01:18:59.480 --> 01:18:59.680]
Yeah.

[01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:03.740]
You know, there were some really great surprises in that concert too.

[01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:04.580]
Such as?

[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.680]
Well, one more day.

[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:10.100]
I'll come out and agrarian skirt and play the electric fondos.

[01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:15.280]
See, now I don't know whether to believe him.

[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:15.840]
That's possible.

[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:21.960]
I was right up front near the stage and Misha was running around with her top off screaming.

[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:22.800]
Do you know me?

[01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:25.440]
That's possible too.

[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:28.160]
Yeah, and a lot of people in the audience said we'd recognize those anywhere.

[01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:30.480]
There were talking about her earrings of work.

[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:35.020]
I'm going to show you after the concert in Beyshire, where would the clone attend the stage now?

[01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:37.520]
It was a great show.

[01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:39.680]
Yeah.

[01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:42.620]
Well, listen, I'm glad you enjoyed it and have a wonderful day.

[01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:45.480]
You didn't say anything about Brian Dorkross.

[01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:47.180]
I do believe the part about Dwight Lauderdale.

[01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:48.200]
Oh, yeah, I believe it.

[01:19:49.060 --> 01:19:51.780]
Okay, it's a low-hot Friday on the J-Michael show on AM.

[01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:54.600]
I guess we don't even bother with that record anymore, right?

[01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:55.880]
Well, I don't know.

[01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:57.200]
I thought you were getting kind of tired of it.

[01:19:57.240 --> 01:19:58.620]
I was before it started.

[01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:00.300]
Now does the rest of the station do that?

[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:00.840]
Still?

[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:02.660]
I'm not sure.

[01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:02.740]
I'm not sure.

[01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:03.720]
And we can it.

[01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:07.420]
Ever since I joined this morning show, I'm kind of sequestered by the rest of the group.

[01:20:07.460 --> 01:20:07.700]
Yeah.

[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:09.320]
That's like quarantine.

[01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:10.420]
I'll ask it.

[01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:12.840]
That's one of my favorite parts of Florida's Jupiter sequester.

[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:16.220]
Broward County, hello.

[01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:17.720]
Good morning, Neil.

[01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:18.880]
I wrote that out, by the way.

[01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:19.560]
What's that?

[01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:21.980]
Cousin, Mugsy, how you doing?

[01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:23.260]
I haven't seen you in years.

[01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:24.420]
Yeah, Mugsy, how are you?

[01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:26.940]
I'm picking a job with a new establishment.

[01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:29.600]
Now Jeff Strike is new manager.

[01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:30.340]
Oh, yeah?

[01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:31.320]
Oh, yeah.

[01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:35.240]
How would you like me to set you up for a session?

[01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:36.520]
Oh, yeah.

[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:37.880]
I guess you could put it that way.

[01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:39.080]
Sounds good to me, Mugsy.

[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:40.420]
Okay, well, I'll...

[01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:43.160]
Speaking of that, the Peter Bullard is my number with the operator.

[01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:44.820]
Okay, hold on a minute.

[01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:47.180]
There's Peter Bullard here just drove ahead.

[01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:49.500]
He's looking at singing there in the sunshine like Gail Garnett.

[01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:50.900]
And here she is on Zeta 4.

[01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:51.980]
We'll sing in the sunshine.

[01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:54.540]
I wouldn't he just pass out.

[01:20:54.660 --> 01:20:56.880]
He would just fall right on the ground out there.

[01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:57.200]
Oh, yeah.

[01:20:57.440 --> 01:20:58.920]
Impale himself on his antenna.

[01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:02.460]
Well, maybe he'll give us the load on on the concert last night and how it went.

[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:04.560]
Since the audience seems to be oblivious.

[01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:06.660]
He seems a little mic shy, though, don't you think?

[01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:10.520]
On this station, when I was on AM, he was always...
