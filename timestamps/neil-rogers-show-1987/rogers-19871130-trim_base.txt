[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220]
We are telling the Oprah joke over the telephone if anybody wants to call.

[00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:06.000]
Oh my gosh.

[00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.900]
Since the last Wednesday, everybody gets a good kick out of it.

[00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.040]
Are you cracked or what?

[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.140]
It's make your own news Monday on WZTA Miami Beach,

[00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.020]
Port Lauderdale, and the Palm beaches,

[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.360]
seven o'clock on the Neil Rogers show,

[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.640]
with Glenda Bird Hill, Captain Dave, and Uncle Neil.

[00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.680]
Do you know that Jimmy the Geek is kind of like the Vanna White of football?

[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.580]
In what way?

[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.380]
Oh man, I'm telling you.

[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.380]
He is getting, he is camping and up so bad on those pre-game shows now in CBS.

[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.140]
Is he really?

[00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.340]
Him and Brent Mausberger, and they're doing this like slap at each other on the arm

[00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.720]
and hitting each other in the neck and belting each other.

[00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.280]
You know, just it's slapstick, it's embarrassing.

[00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.100]
That's what America is all about.

[00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.300]
Vanna White and Jimmy the Geek.

[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.720]
Think about it.

[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.400]
Okay, let's give those tickets away now.

[00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.020]
I really don't know how to do it.

[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.840]
It is interesting though, since I mentioned that,

[00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.420]
that the action on the line seems to have increased dramatically,

[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.180]
like they're all flashing frantically, you pre-loaders.

[00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.800]
Just a cool incident.

[00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.460]
What your pre-loaders on FM, you know?

[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.360]
I bet you when the mail comes in today, there won't be much of anything.

[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.840]
Remember Friday, we gave them about 15 excuses.

[00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.540]
They're better not being in cassettes.

[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.380]
Oh yeah, there better be a whole bunch of those cassettes.

[00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.260]
Oh no, because you'll never see them again.

[00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.480]
Don't send them to me.

[00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.480]
Don't believe what word he says.

[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.460]
He doesn't have the guts.

[00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.740]
You just what you think.

[00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.820]
He doesn't have the guts to do it ladies and gentlemen.

[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.680]
You haven't pushed me far enough yet, but we're getting close.

[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.420]
By the way, about those polaroid pictures, you know?

[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.320]
You're never going to forget.

[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.800]
You're never going to forget that.

[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.280]
I didn't have to define some.

[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.940]
Oh no, not your pictures.

[00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.300]
I bought the camera.

[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.660]
Oh.

[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.660]
Have you forgotten it's only an hour since the show started?

[00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.560]
Is that a guilty conscience you're working on?

[00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.900]
Well, you keep mentioning some other pictures.

[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.880]
I didn't know that Sally was taking polaroids.

[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.940]
Yes, she was.

[00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.960]
She would have liked to have taken the ones that I found in my house.

[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.560]
Pretty interesting.

[00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.460]
Pretty surprising.

[00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:00.700]
Really surprising.

[00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.120]
Okay, where were we going in the white one?

[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.720]
What's that?

[00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.080]
Now, how did you just happen to stumble upon these pictures?

[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.620]
Well, I wouldn't say stumble.

[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.240]
Yeah, what would you say?

[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.900]
What's the, what would be a good diplomatic word?

[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.720]
Yeah, that's what I want to hear.

[00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.060]
Your big diplomatic word.

[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.680]
Encountered, sifted through.

[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.180]
No, not sifted through.

[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.360]
You were looking for something else?

[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.660]
Yeah.

[00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.720]
Oh, what were you looking for?

[00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.760]
Panies.

[00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.140]
Did you find them?

[00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.440]
Yeah.

[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.000]
Oh good.

[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.680]
Right with the pictures.

[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.380]
Great.

[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.240]
Anyway, who cares?

[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.820]
You know, what difference does it make?

[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.160]
I keep trying to explain that.

[00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.220]
But just curious.

[00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:40.160]
Okay.

[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.020]
He doesn't know I found them though.

[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.600]
I've planted the seeds of paranoia, but.

[00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.400]
Okay, where do we go next?

[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.880]
No, we're not going to go to color one.

[00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:48.880]
How are we going to do this?

[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.840]
I'll tell you what, we'll take six little pieces of paper, okay?

[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.940]
Oh, we're going to have a little, uh, whoops.

[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.880]
Why don't you keep it in the middle of the colors that have been waiting in terminable?

[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.440]
You know, something I couldn't give a damn less, okay?

[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.240]
Okay, so don't start with this goody-two shoes who'd have been waiting a long time.

[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.260]
Maybe they're morons.

[00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.080]
How do you know?

[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.180]
He is so out of it.

[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.620]
There he has no idea what it is that we do, you know what?

[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.320]
I'm getting hip.

[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.820]
Are you really slow?

[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.240]
How long do we have to have three bucks?

[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.580]
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

[00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.020]
What happened?

[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.040]
I hit some sort of button.

[00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.540]
The machine went awry.

[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:28.700]
Sorry, go ahead.

[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:31.780]
He'll be all right.

[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.600]
Don't worry about him. He'll be okay.

[00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.180]
Gee, dad, don't worry.

[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.940]
Okay, there's four, five.

[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.360]
See, this is the big time.

[00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.440]
This is the way we do it.

[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.980]
How many hundred?

[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:41.560]
I'm not sure.

[00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.740]

[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.680]
I'm going to be doing this.

[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.080]
There's just a hundred of these.

[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.920]
Are you going to do?

[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.300]
Just six.

[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.320]
Okay, that'll take up to a good time.

[00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.240]
Seven, eight, ninety-nine.

[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.360]
We can kill this damn show at no time.

[00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.660]
122, 123.

[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.800]
Okay, all right, here are these six slips of paper.

[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.220]
I just reached out and pick up one.

[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.500]
Okay, here it is.

[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.680]
Look at that.

[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:06.140]
One.

[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.260]
The one you're going to go through anyway.

[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:08.920]
Hello.

[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.200]
I'm a winner.

[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:11.340]
You're a winner.

[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.800]
Yeah.

[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.360]
Wow.

[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.020]
Now, don't turn out to be a jerk.

[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.600]
Okay, try to be a good guy because you want to tick us.

[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.140]
I just want to say that Brett Mossberger is a jerk.

[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.260]
Brett Mossberger, he makes me sick.

[00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:23.400]
Oh, God.

[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:24.900]
How about that Jimmy the Geek?

[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.560]
The deployable rod, broadcast.

[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.380]
Yeah.

[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.260]
You can say that again.

[00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.260]
What a deplorable game.

[00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.440]
How about those patriots?

[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.020]
How about that Tony Franklin,

[00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.000]
a Mr. One-yard field goal or whatever that one?

[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.240]
I mean, that guy is just pathetic.

[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.880]
Yeah.

[00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.220]
I'm not Tony Segredo's a jerk too.

[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.960]
And I want to rip in Tony for Tony's a good friend of mine.

[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.240]
Why do you want to rip everybody?

[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.020]
I'm sorry.

[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.000]
Tony's a good guy.

[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.800]
Okay.

[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.520]
If you say so.

[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.980]
All right.

[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.140]
Why don't you like Tony?

[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.160]
You kicked the people out of the stadium in the orange bowl the other night.

[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.940]
And one guy got thrown around his head.

[00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.460]
What are you talking about?

[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.120]
The police.

[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.380]
The police?

[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:02.740]
What does that guy do with Tony?

[00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.980]
He was doing a remote from the orange bowl after the game.

[00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.740]
You're getting the sound a little like Howard Cocella.

[00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:10.940]
Is this called Gozon?

[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.280]
Great winner, Neil.

[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.980]
Wow.

[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.600]
Yeah.

[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.520]
How would you like to give up those tickets, my friend?

[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.080]
Whatever you think, Mr. Rogers.

[00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:21.800]
Oh, you really want to give them up?

[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.780]
I'm just being honest.

[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.940]
I don't think this guy wants a ticket.

[00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.920]
Yeah, I don't think so.

[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.320]
Okay.

[00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.040]
I don't see the direction the call was going.

[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.980]
I couldn't get a deal.

[00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.040]
I'm not giving him a damn ticket.

[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.340]
When he started cutting Tony, that was it.

[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.600]

[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.860]
He didn't do that.

[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.740]
He was like, hey, if you don't want to give them to me, fine.

[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.500]
Okay, good.

[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:42.220]
You don't get him.

[00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.040]
I don't think he knew what you were giving him.

[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.380]
He doesn't know from nothing.

[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.820]
That is just a sour push.

[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.520]
Another South Florida sour push.

[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.160]
Something free.

[00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.080]
Oh, I'll take it.

[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.060]
Something worse than a sour push.

[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.380]
It's six minutes past seven on Zeta 4.

[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.240]
And not oh, geez, I threw the numbers away.

[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.820]
Okay, wait a minute.

[00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:58.480]
I got to do it again.

[00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:59.140]
Oh, no.

[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.840]
This will eat up a lot of time.

[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:01.160]
Okay.

[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.300]
Won't you do the weather?

[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.820]
Yeah, we'll do the weather while you're doing that.

[00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.580]
It's Thursdays and it's number five.

[00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.180]
Yay.

[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.240]
We haven't punched it up yet.

[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.120]
Don't count your call or me for it, Hatches.

[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.100]
Hello.

[00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.860]
Oh, geez.

[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.580]
I can't out of here.

[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.100]
We can't even give the damn tickets away.

[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.600]
Don't worry about it.

[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.980]
Plenty of time.

[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.420]
Okay, and it's fine with me.

[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.060]
Now what's that?

[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.960]
Is that an extra number?

[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.700]
Don't rig this.

[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.380]
Now this has got to be done kosher.

[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.680]
Won't you wait a while?

[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:36.380]
Do it later.

[00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:37.420]
You want to do it now?

[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:37.560]
You can't do it now.

[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.740]
I'll show it later.

[00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.560]
That's a good idea.

[00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:40.740]
Yeah, this is number one.

[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:41.080]
I'll show it.

[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.740]
We can't even give them a while.

[00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:43.700]
I've got another number one.

[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:44.880]
I can't even give them a while.

[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:45.500]
Isn't that amazing?

[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.100]
What an audience we've got, right?

[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.020]
A bunch of morons.

[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.900]
We want to give you the damn pair of you two tickets and all you can do is call an act like

[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:52.600]
Jack Gases.

[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.180]
I mean, if you can't even act a little bit civilized, forget it.

[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.200]
We're not going to give you anything except a hard time.

[00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:00.300]
You came to the right place.

[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.160]
Although there are a lot of you out there probably would like that.

[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.460]
I know I would.

[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.600]
It's eight minutes past seven.

[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.380]
I'm going to say the four.

[00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:08.540]
She's the Louise.

[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.560]
Oh, yeah.

[00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.060]
You have no idea what kind of household I live in.

[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.140]
That's right.

[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.040]
Deion Warwick is singing promises, promises in my house right now.

[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.420]
It's all for naught.

[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.760]
Okay, so I guess we just turn off the phone.

[00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.420]
Let's start playing some music, right?

[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.720]
Yeah, but you do have that great mudslide and I'm real jealousy.

[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.260]
Okay, should we play a level findaway by Yes?

[00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:30.340]
Up to you.

[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.080]
Yeah.

[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:31.260]
Yeah.

[00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:31.440]
Yeah.

[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.320]
This is the same guy who's playing a bubble brain by Paul Simon last week.

[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.740]
Oh, that's a good boy in the bubble.

[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.600]
And you were that Jetta James cut that was so embarrassing.

[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:42.340]
Oh, come on.

[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:42.760]

[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:44.800]
Jetta James.

[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:45.320]
Yeah.

[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:46.980]
Well, we didn't play it all.

[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.620]
She doesn't win more village yet to James.

[00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:49.800]
She's my favorite.

[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.580]
And we're going to send her a wonder mug just for being a Zeta loyalist.

[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:53.900]
Right.

[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.080]
She's walking her door right now at win more.

[00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.140]
Where did they get the name for the mug?

[00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:01.700]
I mean, what's the idea behind it being a wonder?

[00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:03.580]
You want to 741?

[00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:04.580]
741.

[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.220]
You want to get it?

[00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:07.360]
No, it's 709.

[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.100]
Oh, jeez.

[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.560]
Those people attempted humor of his, you know?

[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.340]
You're not today, Captain Dave.

[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.000]
Since he said call the police, he's never been the same.

[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:18.300]
I know.

[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.600]
Since that line slipped out.

[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.880]
You see, he's still living on that, you know.

[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.400]
You notice now the lines are going nuts.

[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.820]
I don't know what you people are calling for because we gave two people a chance

[00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:29.580]
to win those U2 tickets and you couldn't handle it.

[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.000]
You acted like bird brains.

[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.840]
And we don't want to be accused of sending bird brains to U2.

[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.440]
That's this Thursday, by the way.

[00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:37.240]
I can't remember it.

[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:37.880]
You're correct in the orange bull.

[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.960]
Boy, it seems like we've only been promoting it for seven months.

[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.700]
That's what, December 3rd.

[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:48.620]
And our promo says, we'll be there at the orange bull broadcasting live from 10am to show time.

[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:49.400]
Isn't that exciting?

[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:49.780]
Hmm.

[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.340]
To personally thank you.

[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:56.300]
We want to thank you for being Zeta loyalistners and look for us near gate 14A

[00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:01.880]
with a limited number of Zeta for U2 t-shirts, bumper stickers, plates and cassette copies

[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.660]
of the Joshua tree.

[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.400]
Neat.

[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:05.320]
Netnino?

[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:05.820]
Yeah.

[00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.500]
And the guns is going to be there.

[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:11.240]
It's going to be giving away copies of the tape that goes, hi, Jeffy.

[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.960]
They might even have some wonder mugs, you know.

[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:16.240]
Yeah.

[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.340]
Maybe Jay Michaels will be there with some W-I-N-Z wonder mugs.

[00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:20.660]
To give away.

[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.420]
The ones that he was supposed to give away Friday when nobody showed up.

[00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:24.140]
Ooh.

[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:28.720]
See, all of those, all of these idiotic things like at the myriad and all these other,

[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.860]
I mean, how many times can you go to the well and do the same thing?

[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:32.180]
Right.

[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.700]
And it's just like some of the stuff that happens with this station, with the FM, right, Tony Prado?

[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:39.380]
You idiot.

[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.480]
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.820]
She and that cherry home and they get together in the atrium, you know, they need to like,

[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.480]
you know, they can't handle this.

[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.880]
They can't handle the truth is finally out.

[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.140]
I mean, if you're going to act like a bird brain, we're going to expose you for what you aren't.

[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:57.900]
It's as simple as that.

[00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.340]
It's not like we're making it up.

[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.000]
Am I right?

[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.240]
Well, look at me.

[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.340]
Who the hell is this stiff that just drove in here?

[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.140]
Man, I'll tell you, this place is really something.

[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:06.840]
I have no idea.

[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.320]
You think people are coming back to work today?

[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:09.960]
I don't know.

[00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.060]
I really don't know.

[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.860]
That guy that he just drives around the parking lot about three times.

[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:15.360]
Oh, yeah.

[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:16.820]
We like him a lot.

[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.400]
He's the one that just lost the U2 tickets.

[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.120]
Oh, it was a mobile.

[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.300]
We still don't get any mobile callers.

[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.600]
Are you idiots in a mobile phone?

[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:27.060]
I'm sorry.

[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.740]
I don't know what your story is.

[00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.620]
You understand that?

[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:31.020]
I don't.

[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.000]
Can't figure that out.

[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:32.520]
No, I know.

[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.300]
On AM, we used to get millions of people in mobile phone.

[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:35.640]
How many?

[00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:36.840]
Couple.

[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.460]
11 after 7 on Zeta 4.

[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:41.780]
And Mark Alpert.

[00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.580]
Isn't that his favorite group?

[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:45.460]
Yes.

[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.820]
That's a matter that you mentioned.

[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:48.620]
Well, we'll find a way.

[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:52.240]
Speaking of other things from New York that we despised besides Mark Alpert, how about those

[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.580]
giants yesterday, huh?

[00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:54.900]
Looking good.

[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.300]
Was that the Philadelphia game?

[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.740]
No, that was the Washington, New York game.

[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:01.360]
Who won that?

[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:03.080]
Philadelphia was playing New England.

[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:03.620]
I saw.

[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.520]
So he had one word right.

[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.220]
It wasn't in New York.

[00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.120]
It was New England.

[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:06.460]
Oh, yeah.

[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.640]
I saw some of the overtime.

[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:09.200]
That was a wild game.

[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:10.400]
That was a pathetic game.

[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:10.840]
Wild.

[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:12.200]
Out of control.

[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:12.880]
Paget.

[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.240]
I mean, the Patriots come from behind 31 to 10.

[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:15.900]
Yeah.

[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.640]
In less than 10 minutes to go, they tie it up.

[00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:18.860]
They blow a chance to win it.

[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.040]
Then they lose it an overtime.

[00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.200]
I mean, that's just tragic.

[00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:23.580]
Are they kept kicking field goals?

[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:24.700]
That's quite a division, isn't it?

[00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:25.340]
The AFC.

[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.720]
That's quite a division, very well put.

[00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:30.520]
And like the bills and the jets are in first place.

[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:31.280]
The bills.

[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:31.920]
Yeah.

[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:32.420]
Yeah.

[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.540]
Now, who won the Washington game?

[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:36.360]
The Washington lose?

[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.540]
The Washington won.

[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:38.400]
Did they really?

[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.760]
Clock ran out as the giants got to the one yard line.

[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:41.360]
I loved it.

[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:41.820]
Pretty.

[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.040]
All those New York mavens.

[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:43.760]
Yeah.

[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.260]
And Jimmy the geek.

[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.040]
Oh, yeah.

[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:46.980]
Half time.

[00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:47.800]
He was really gloating.

[00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.520]
His giants were way ahead.

[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.420]
It's not at half time that counts.

[00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.300]
Jimmy, it's the score when the game is over.

[00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.140]
That's generally what counts.

[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:55.440]

[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.160]
Well, that's pretty revolutionary.

[00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:00.860]
Don't get any brownie points in the standings for being ahead at half time.

[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:01.400]
Is that right?

[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.800]
It's like it would be like in a horse race if, you know, your horse is ahead at the half

[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:06.580]
mile pole.

[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.100]
It doesn't count.

[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:07.960]
No.

[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.320]
You ought to be ahead at the finish, at the wire.

[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.980]
Well, I appreciate you straightening me out.

[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:11.980]

[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:13.720]
Because I had a little confusion on that myself.

[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:17.160]
Oh, hey, listen, if being ahead at the half mile pole is what counted, I'd have a lot

[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.000]
of money in my car.

[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:21.860]
I had a lot of those horses in front early and then all of a sudden they looked down

[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:24.180]
that stretch and it's puke city.

[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:26.780]
Is that how you want to term?

[00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:27.700]
Yeah, I think so.

[00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:30.740]
It's like those rides I was talking about at the Brown County Fair.

[00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:31.640]
It's a puke city, yeah.

[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.180]
718 on Zeta 4.

[00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:34.160]
And let's take some calls.

[00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.940]
But if you think you're going to win the tickets now or weasel them out of me, you're

[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:38.360]
dreaming.

[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.080]
You don't care if you give them away or not.

[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.200]
It's at all.

[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:41.840]
You don't care.

[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:42.040]
No.

[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.200]
If you feel like it.

[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.420]
I'm upset that we did not have a presence.

[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:50.060]
In fact, my being there was about the only presence this station had in the Brown County

[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:50.420]
Fair.

[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.600]
We appreciate you going.

[00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:52.020]
Yeah.

[00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:52.680]
Thanks a lot.

[00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:53.660]
Only cost me 100 bucks.

[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:55.120]
Don't you think you got to reimburse me?

[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.160]
Yeah, that's the better.

[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.920]
I mean, what do you spend 20 bucks to win a 50 cent rob low poster?

[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.800]
No, no, actually the posters, I don't understand that thing.

[00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.580]
I mean, all you got to do is throw the dart and it sticks in the poster.

[00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:07.700]
I don't know.

[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:10.240]
And give it like five darts for a buck or something.

[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.600]
Did they have any Phoebe?

[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.120]
And I mean, you got to be an idiot.

[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:14.740]
You got to be totally inept.

[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:15.920]
How many Phoebe posts?

[00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.760]
I mean, even Stevie Wonder was there and winning the posters with the dart.

[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.000]
So it was quite serious.

[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.640]
I couldn't believe it.

[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:23.360]
So no Kate's poster?

[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.200]
No Phoebe Kate.

[00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:25.760]
So I had a couple of George Kate's posters.

[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.560]
Here's Munglo and the theme from Picnic on Zeta 4.

[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.000]
That's what we ought to do one day to really screw him up.

[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.160]
Get the consultants crazy.

[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:38.500]
What kind of like play Mitch Miller?

[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:39.420]
Pat Boone.

[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:40.300]
Pat Boone?

[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:40.600]
Yeah.

[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:41.720]
Eddie Haywood.

[00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.680]
Remember soft summer breeze by Eddie Haywood?

[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:45.340]
Vagley.

[00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:46.540]
Great record.

[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.620]
Very vaguely.

[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:49.620]
I think Moody River would be good.

[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:50.380]
Pat Boone, yeah.

[00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:52.000]
And I would vote for the Moody River.

[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:55.280]
By the way, if you want to copy of the Boone in the box, just send a stamp.

[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.380]
We don't have any.

[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:56.880]
Why not?

[00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:58.240]
There we mailed them all out.

[00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.020]
How can they be all gone?

[00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:00.640]
How can they be all gone?

[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:01.400]
I don't have any.

[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:01.840]
Sorry.

[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:03.140]
Pat Boone sticking.

[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:04.560]
Yeah.

[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:05.860]
Something through a box.

[00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:08.420]
See the FM audience, they don't know what you're talking about.

[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.800]
What FM audience?

[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.940]
What was he talking about?

[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:13.480]
I don't know.

[00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:16.600]
All right, let's take a call.

[00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:17.840]
I started looking at the screen.

[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:18.400]
I shouldn't know.

[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:20.660]
Dave, what's this?

[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:21.040]
Wait a minute.

[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:21.880]
What just happened there?

[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.240]
I like the way this is going.

[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.420]
I like this.

[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:24.440]

[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.020]
I just, hello.

[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:25.460]
Yes.

[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.260]
I just lost one of my eardrums when he just changed years now.

[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.000]
Sorry about that.

[00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:29.820]
Okay.

[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:30.940]
How is this better?

[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:31.420]
Yeah.

[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:32.220]
Much better.

[00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:32.800]
Okay.

[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:35.080]
I just want to do a snore for those tickets.

[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:35.840]
No chance.

[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:36.460]
No chance?

[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:37.780]
Not a chance in a million.

[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:42.600]
I figured since you were so upset over those last two collars, you'd get somebody who would

[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.180]
be a...

[00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:44.180]
Well, you figured wrong, pal.

[00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:45.180]
You figured wrong.

[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.060]
Well, that'll be a good show anyway.

[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:50.500]
Okay.

[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.020]
Now, how do you like the show so far?

[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:52.800]
Be honest with me.

[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:53.580]
On a scale of one.

[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.480]
So far, it's a one.

[00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:56.240]
Yeah.

[00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:56.660]
Mm.

[00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.500]
Out of a one, it's your same great show.

[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:00.280]
As always.

[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:00.940]
That's always.

[00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.220]
Well, you still don't get the tickets.

[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:03.240]
I don't want them now.

[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:03.640]
Okay.

[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.160]
Thanks anyway.

[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:05.900]
Thank you, Neil.

[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:06.420]
Bye-bye.

[00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:07.420]
Bye-bye.

[00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:09.380]
There are those bleeds tickets anyway.

[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:10.960]
There are nosebleed tickets.

[00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:11.720]
I think so, yeah.

[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:12.460]
Oh, jeez.

[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.900]
In other words, like if you want to be up in the helicopter with Alabora, you'd have a

[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:17.220]
clearance.

[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.100]
You'd have a better chance of seeing something than where you're going to sit with the

[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:20.500]
Azeta.

[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.360]
You mean we've been lying to these people?

[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.540]
I hear those promos where we say we have all these choice locations.

[00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:27.400]
All these great, yeah.

[00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:28.140]
Front row seats.

[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:28.400]
Are they really?

[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:29.200]
Are these front rows?

[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:29.700]
No, no.

[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:30.400]
We know.

[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.780]
It does not say front row.

[00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.780]
Don't start saying things like that, you'll create a problem.

[00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:36.120]
Well, that's a way Jack asked.

[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.340]
Jack asked, we can ask him.

[00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:38.680]
Front row tickets, yeah.

[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:39.000]
That'll be it.

[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.140]
I thought I heard a promo, that says something about that.

[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.180]
I just heard that you had to share one of the tickets with Sir Edmund Hillary.

[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:44.740]
It was a-

[00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.740]
I got news for her if we had front row tickets, Gary Lawrence would have him.

[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:48.260]
True.

[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:48.880]
Okay?

[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:49.580]
And his family.

[00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:50.360]
Mm-hmm.

[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:55.640]
You know that he has a son whose girlfriend, I was going to say he has a son whose

[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:56.760]
daughter, but that wouldn't have been right.

[00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:02.400]
He has a son whose girlfriend is a waitress at the melting pot in cross brings did you know that yeah

[00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:10.560]
That's one of those good-looking girls that work there then has to be because they don't have any ugly girls at work there want to bet

[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.400]
Okay 21 past seven

[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.720]
Yes on Zeta 4

[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:22.660]
There's something wrong with this. I don't care what you say it just doesn't sound right to me

[00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:29.060]
Did you sound hollow what what you say what hollow? Yeah a little hollow. I don't think so and just not

[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:35.520]
I think it is it's those cans you got on your head. What are you talking about? I bought these with my own two cents

[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:40.260]
These are great. What's wrong with these? These are sent hiser 60 bucks. Wow

[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:46.660]
722

[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.960]
Okay, let's call Greg and Donald and see how they're done

[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:53.800]
Broward County. Hello

[00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:57.000]
Yeah, sir. Hey, dude. How you doing? Okay?

[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.000]
Let's see yeah

[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.960]
I'll dirt on you from for S. I'm there mr.

[00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.060]
Mr. Sunshine over there. What about him? I

[00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:12.800]
Talk and I think it's Friday. I said he's telling you how you don't have a show in the show something complain about right?

[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:18.000]
Yeah, that's right. Well, I don't believe it. Hey Rickles and Madonna for years. No, he's

[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.400]
Well, at least we have a show

[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:24.920]
At least we've got one which is more I can say for some people in the business not to mention him

[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:30.580]
And by the way when we started locking this door the man was actually crying in the atrium out here

[00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:32.880]
Can you believe it a grown man in tears?

[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:37.180]
And I'm a cherry with that door locked that's right. I'm a little narrow over the phone. What is it?

[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:42.200]
I don't well, that's because of this lousy speaker phone. Oh, yeah, it's a little better. Oh, I got great

[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:44.280]
Dogland

[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:44.700]
Oh

[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:48.840]
My mouth full of coffee great

[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:03.100]
Yeah, I'm with you sir. Yeah, I don't know what we're going go ahead rip the crap out of my okay

[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:08.520]
Yeah, so you know this guy called up saying I'll great you were you are, you know, and this is after you left and I'll great

[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.400]
He's yeah, he's trying to give me a new word. He says

[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.920]
Stand you should use this word instead of kneels

[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:20.040]
In credible he should say or end us, you know, that was

[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.560]
Oh, there's an eternal one stand on that

[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.680]
He'll leave a bowl. Yeah, and then

[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:28.560]
Then I was saying to him. Well, what do you think if we make it make it big?

[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:33.080]
They let us on over in England and the guy says oh no, you'd never get on in England and

[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.980]
And Stan said well, maybe they take kneel in England, you know, and then he said

[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:43.200]
I guess there was a reference to that maybe the English you're a little swishy or something, you know, the English are a little swishy

[00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:46.080]
What do you want from people who worship a queen sir?

[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:51.440]
Yeah, right right right. Yeah, in fact, not even say that this guy I recognize this guy's voice from you know

[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.480]
Much before when I was a two-year-old an I&C

[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:54.640]
Yeah, it was the guy

[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:58.180]
It was the same guy that called up and he was used all ragged about one day

[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.320]
Canadian and bitching out the queen and the royal family. Yeah

[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.760]
But apparently you can murder them along the way because he was you know talking good about you

[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:10.140]
Great, okay. Well listen. It's been an illuminating call. Yeah, I just it's been great. You like to think

[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:15.460]
I you know Jay Jay Michaels you've got to chase me over the Y&Z about a year and a half ago. Yeah, it's me up that thing

[00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:19.280]
So I appreciate it for me. You tell me on your show kind of really

[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.720]
Chasing a lot of other people too. Yeah, okay

[00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.600]
Goodbye would you please?

[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.900]
Would you say goodbye please?

[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:40.080]
I mean he was not a bad guy, but he could he could have gone on till 9 30

[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:44.440]
Oh, yeah, we could have written up to number 400 on the slips and he would have still been

[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:49.760]
Look at those phones man. These people are like vultures. You had to be able to relate to that

[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:53.260]
All they only got to do is sniff that there might be something for free in the life

[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:54.580]
They're just going crazy

[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:59.220]
It was a typical Monday morning and it was not much happening and all I did was mention had one lousy

[00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:04.500]
Paratickets from like up in the rafters there like in fact, it's in the John is where you sit

[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:10.260]
The people I don't know it could be some good tickets, but I was just presuming since it was the last

[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:14.920]
But you don't really know, but you just open a big mouth and you make it sound like we're a bunch of well

[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:18.040]
We already embarrassed ourselves by not being into Broward County fear

[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.700]
Now you're trying to say that the you two tickets were given away our stiffs

[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:29.480]
Is that what you're trying to say? No, it gets you in the orange bowl to hear the great music and yeah, you know and smell the aroma

[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:37.080]
Okay, they're bad tickets, but bring binoculars 26 past seven on Zeta 4 and let's go to

[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:43.940]
Oh, I guess date County hello. Hi. I like to talk about Brett Musburger Brent mouse burger. Yeah, that

[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:49.960]
That guy proves that there is gravity because his eyelids are hanging lower than well

[00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:55.180]
There was a funny thing about watching the game Saturday

[00:20:55.180 --> 00:21:00.980]
It wasn't just enjoying watching Notre Dame getting their butt kicked was just like Brett Muscabur trying to cover up for what he said

[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.980]
About you and we're like they're not a great team or anything. Yeah, what the hell does he know?

[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.980]
What the hell does he know right I got an idea in the else. Why don't we take

[00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:14.660]
The UM defense and put it with the dolphins just take this kill the dolphin defense

[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:18.420]
I know but I'm so awesome when little have an intruder. Oh come on

[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.380]
She may be wound him a little bit, but not not kill him

[00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:27.180]
I mean their marina's allowed to have a day off. And Dan marino yes, then it was like out to lunch

[00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:31.420]
He wasn't even there they were playing they were playing in Buffalo and he was in win more

[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.680]
Team for two years he was in win more village looking for a wonder mod

[00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:39.020]
The Jiro Paul gang over there. Yeah

[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:44.380]
Well listen good luck to you sir. Okay, how nice day you two have a wonderful life

[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:48.920]
Shoot nice young man only a football game. Hey listen, what's more important?

[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.220]
Yeah, really

[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:57.200]
Your priorities. Yeah, you're right. I gotta get my priorities straight down. Shola man. What a jerk the game is passing him by

[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.340]
Yeah, life is passing him by

[00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:03.000]
We got that great beautiful new stadium now. We need is a football team

[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:09.220]
And that'd be great if we had a team maybe pipe or high could yeah take over or maybe killing and huh

[00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:15.120]
Speaking of stadiums and coliseums and such I heard from a good source that the heat is history

[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:21.980]
Are you serious? I mean they didn't sell the 85,000 tickets that they need this up. This is the same academic anyway

[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:27.300]
I'm really that it's over. Hey, wouldn't that be great now this this would save us one of the another

[00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:31.220]
Embarrassment we've had a lot of embarrassments in this stuff, but this would save us yet another

[00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:36.360]
Colossal humiliation I heard they're going to use the Coliseum to play concerts and

[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:39.120]
Oh really I heard they're gonna have cock fights there

[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:43.960]
I think you're right. Yeah, Neil. Why does Dia Simegoes?

[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:49.220]
And we're all these new Cubans come in man. We got to have something they can relate to they can make him right?

[00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:52.460]
Well money will just roll it isn't that what we need is some more like refugees here

[00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:56.140]
I think that's exactly what we need to kind of spice up our lives. It's been boring

[00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:01.600]
Pretty boring. Let's have about 50 million refugees and we'll bring them all into date cowty, okay?

[00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:08.000]
Just keep them out of brown. Yeah, no brown. Oh, and then yesterday you would have you would have died if you'd have seen this on

[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.840]
This week with David Brinkley they had mayor sewers on who?

[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:19.360]
Xavier Sewers. Oh, yeah, so I saw that. Yeah, and did you see the it was one of the funniest things I ever heard my life

[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:25.220]
He said the Cuban immigrants who came here before 1980 set all kinds of records for

[00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:32.700]
Productivity and getting jobs and I thought to myself where do you look that up like like where is the record book to find about

[00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:38.920]
Productivity of immigrants, you know like like it's like saying well when the Irish came in or the Jews came in or the Poles

[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:44.480]
You know in a early part of the century they weren't very productive even though they worked in the sweatshops 30 hours a day

[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:48.660]
But we're how can he come up with a line like that and get away with it, you know

[00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:55.540]
And all these great journalists George Will is sitting there and Sam Donaldson with that plastic face of his and David Brinkley

[00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:58.880]
It was a good guy, but he's been mummified for at least five years now

[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:03.880]
They just knew suit. They just let it go and they just let it go and they do all the Cuban immigrants who came here before

[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:07.200]
1980 have said all kinds of records for what for what

[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:12.640]
What the hell is this man talking about what a pandora he is just the worst I think they have

[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:18.000]
So records and cock fighting. Yeah, no question about that. It's Santaria or at least in part of that

[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:28.560]
730 this is let that go on Zeta 4. Yeah, I was fighting is what I was talking to I know now somebody out there with a dirty mind

[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:33.060]
You know, so there's another indecent shot, you know that buddy Nevin's at this

[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:39.400]
News slum Sentinel. What is with that guy anyway? What's with that paper every day every single day?

[00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:43.180]
He's got another story, but it's a non-story. There's nothing going on buddy

[00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:49.360]
Anything you read in that paper I would take with the grain of salt that paper is just just incredible

[00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:56.520]
They don't when is there a spot coming up? Oh God. Okay. Yeah, thanks. Uh Howard County. Hello

[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.920]
Stan how you doing? Okay, George are you?

[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.440]
You're the greatest man. Yeah

[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:05.620]
Yeah

[00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:13.020]
It is up. Okay, don't buy a house wrong show, but the right idea

[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:20.540]
I like that call. Yeah, he was good. He was perfect for Stan Stan is got like he's following you know basically a

[00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:25.560]
I almost said dead air that would have been nasty because Jay wouldn't like that, but they're desperate over there

[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.660]
You know what and at mark. You and he's gonna turn that a.m. into a parking lot

[00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:32.780]
Is he yep you predicted that a while ago?

[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:37.820]
Well, when he first came here as a matter of fact as a give us give this man enough time and enough leeway

[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:44.700]
Man, he'll turn this whole place into a gigantic parking lot and he can the same man who gave us Daffy McCallum and

[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:51.140]
Tomorrow being Tuesday that brings to mind talk net, you know and all that other brilliant innovative talk man

[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:55.520]
The same guy who gave us that is gonna really do a number over there. You can go to the bank on it

[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.400]
I thought you said he was gonna. I don't want to say how small the number will be

[00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:03.400]
You said he would turn it into a Chinese restaurant or two Howard lines not flashing by the way

[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:08.580]
It wouldn't you be embarrassed and humiliated if we give away the you two tickets on one of the lines that you're not ringing right now

[00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:10.040]
What does that mean?

[00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:12.100]
At 7 7 9

[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:19.240]
3600 how could we give him away on a line? It's not ringing well what you meant was wouldn't it wouldn't you be upset if you gave the tickets away

[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:23.680]
And you weren't calling yeah, no it could be you. Oh, there they go now. We're not gonna give him away right now

[00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:28.840]
But you never know Howard County hello. No, how are you doing today?

[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:33.840]
New great. How are you? Oh? I'm hanging in there hanging in there another weekend. Yeah, I'm gonna go

[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:38.720]
I've never made it to the fair but I thought about it the fair was so much fun. It was great

[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:44.120]
Yeah, I'm gonna try to make it to the circus that one of these years. Have you ever had that fried dough?

[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:48.880]
Yeah, yeah, cuz I I looked at it and it looked so tantalized

[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.060]
I can't eat stuff like that

[00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:54.980]
Yeah, I know the fried food will do you and that's the only thing go on one of those wild rides right yeah

[00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:57.860]
Then get off and you can't stand the fair anymore after that

[00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:01.860]
I think that's what kind of kept me away as I remember that, you know you go on a couple of rides

[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:07.060]
Well, I went all of the thing all you smell is kind of like greasy food. No, there was a lot of good food there

[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:13.100]
In fact, in fact, I'll tell you what I did have I had one of those Italian sausage sandwiches with peppers and onions

[00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:15.740]
Now that's our good always that good man

[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:18.800]
You have to have those every time you get any kind of fair. Yeah

[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:25.200]
I got a two-year-old here who when he hears your promo that Neil song he starts singing it

[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:29.020]
Oh, great. I could never get him to sing it, you know with you on right now

[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:31.100]
But he does sing it when he hears it well

[00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:36.240]
We like you know the kind of infantile touch on his show. Yeah, it makes me feel it makes me feel at home

[00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:44.720]
Two and up right yeah, that's really good now. Do I win the Wii U to tickets for that? No

[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:51.540]
Oh, well, at least I tried you know I gave it my best shot you sure did okay. You have a good day today YouTube

[00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:55.100]
Okay, bye bye YouTube YouTube YouTube

[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.400]
7.33 on Zeta 4

[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.520]
Zeta 4 on a dial

[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:23.340]
Trying to work in my rules with a dolly nail with Zeta 4 on my dial

[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:32.200]
Un-feel-evalable

[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.440]
Neil Neil Neil

[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:53.500]
What do you think of a guy who runs you around in a retail store with a thing on his back a thing that says

[00:28:54.400 --> 00:29:00.000]
Unbelievable and incredible. Hmm. What was his name again? I lose his card. I forget. Oh, that would be embarrassing

[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.420]
It was wolf camera. Yeah in the Howard Marl glass the Howard mall the Howard mall

[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:08.980]
The Howard mall is I guess all of them all is now just

[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:13.400]
Oh, yeah, oh God with incredible looking people these days

[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:20.480]
I told you yeah, so if you're into shopping or you into trolling good luck to you any mall do I think

[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:26.440]
Anyway, I turned around we were seeing there at the circus and I turned around and I looked behind me

[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:32.460]
It's a 25 before it was one of the most freaky things that has ever happened to me

[00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:37.420]
What are the odds on that you know and here was this very attractive young man?

[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:38.620]
I would say 20

[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:43.860]
Yeah, and a nice-looking young lady. Oh, we're getting close to this story again

[00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:48.200]
Well, I've already kind of like spelled it out. What do I have to say? No? I

[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:53.320]
Got it. Did you it was I get convoluted several times as a matter of fact, but that's another story

[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:58.840]
Yeah, anyway, we don't want to go into that because that could be interpreted as indecent and immoral and offensive to

[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:03.360]
Decent see and morally offensive and all of that other but I like this kind of like Tony Prato

[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:07.880]
Thought it was a good story that's gonna be our pull question little later on on Zeta for today

[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:12.880]
Seriously is Tony Prato indecent or obscene our promotions director

[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:16.860]
We're bringing in Lee himself to do that poll

[00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:21.560]
That's a follow-up. Yeah, I think that's a poll that calls for a professional pollster

[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.680]
So Lee if you're listening

[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:27.100]
Yeah, we're not bringing she's gonna get all been out of shape

[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:30.280]
Oh, I know she's gonna be whispering with Sherry Hall in the hall

[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:38.660]
Prato was ca pretation what I'm doing there in the pool to put on the air with it now that I always just a scud

[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:41.660]
They were eating on the air making federal sounds. Oh, it's just terrible

[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.140]
There's still upset about me

[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:47.680]
What do you want you still want your point three honey is that what you want because we can arrange it

[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:52.320]
You know what I'm saying no problem at all call up Jeff Chase get him back in here

[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:59.980]
That's good for an immediate one point decline automatic. He won't you're only doing a one so why do they still have Jeff Chase's picture in the

[00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:03.180]
You notice are they try to give us a message like none of us

[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:08.920]
Okay, isn't it interesting? This is the morning show on what is obviously the more important to them of the two stations

[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:15.420]
So this is the biggie and none of the three of us have a picture anywhere on either wall not just on the FM wall

[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:22.220]
But a m b m b m or FM there is no picture of any of us but Jeff Chase a Jeff Chase who doesn't even work here anymore

[00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:27.700]
He's got this beautiful color portrait. It's a good picture. Yeah, don't you have a Polaroid camera?

[00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:32.600]
Yeah, I'll bring in my Polaroid. Oh get Sally will bring in our specimen camera

[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:36.100]
I'm bringing some of those pictures

[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:40.180]
Yeah, why don't you do that? I don't have no going there in Atlanta

[00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:46.100]
737 trust me on Zeta 4 and where should we go next he asked?

[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:52.520]
Oh, I see no don't worry about it. I'll just I'll just punch him up. I'm used to this date County. Hello

[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.340]

That first you wanted the tickets and told you that he started ripping Tony sigredo nobody rips Tony sigredo on my show

[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:48.300]
You're still not getting the ticket

[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:50.800]
Ha, not the black kid that he got no

[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:55.920]
Yeah, you you went to black kid that you were fighting with we would have given you the tickets, but you're suspended

[00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:57.540]
Yeah

[00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:04.000]
Suspended a sentence suspended a sentence remember that in the godfather

[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.280]
Go ahead what what are you talking about?

[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:13.740]
Best about how we started with the studio. Let me say this to you if you would say ask you a question

[00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:15.320]
Then you and that black kid wouldn't be fighting

[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.840]
Okay, ask me anything

[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.160]
Oh, yeah, that was a great call

[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:28.140]
You thought I was gonna give you the tickets

[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:37.980]
What is it to you what are you concerned about what people are doing with their private parts?

[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:42.440]
Are you writing are you writing a book?

[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:45.860]
96

[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:52.300]
Okay, have a nice day. He's gonna start talking about Queens at power 96. Oh really?

[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:55.240]
Is that where he was headed? We don't have enough time for that call sir

[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:03.900]
I didn't cut him off because I was afraid he was gonna say I just we just don't have that much time left in the show

[00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:08.040]
That's right. He starts running down that list. It's like reading the phone book

[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:12.500]
You want to play a spot? No, it's not due till the end of the hour

[00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:18.360]
I think this is no spot Monday. No, you're wrong. You're absolutely wrong. We got three minutes look at that log

[00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:22.500]
That's a six o'clock one. No, it's not. It's the seven o'clock one and next hour

[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:27.780]
We got three minutes in the last hour. No, I think we got four this hour. Oh, yeah, you're right

[00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:31.700]
We do have four this hour. Well, why the hell don't you go in there? We'll play two of them now and two of them later

[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:37.080]
Seven forty I think we're gonna do a four-minute break just because you're sitting here on your ass you idiot

[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.600]
I was with him anyway, man

[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:44.620]
He just comes in with a cup of coffee at his tangerine and hey, baby. I'm just lounging around

[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:49.940]
I'm playing most of the music on cart today. You notice he's like got nothing to do in there

[00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:53.600]
Yeah, played yes, and that was his like his big production number for the day

[00:34:54.940 --> 00:35:00.720]
Okay, let's do a little break. It's a six seven eight. What the hell is it now seven seven forty?

[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:05.860]
Are you sure? Yes, I am are you positive? We're getting to my cast here twenty two late on Zeta four

[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:07.080]

[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:10.960]
Listen

[00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:15.740]
He's got it

[00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:21.900]
He's got the

[00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:21.900]

[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:50.480]
When I first heard him with his wit so mighty, his soul was so weak, but always excited.

[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:57.660]
Now I always hear him, but won't get to the other end.

[00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:07.420]
All who knows when you look at my rear end, that way, it's a new living morning.

[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:18.240]
He's up over the line, he's got the battle rim in, there's seen such a pride.

[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:31.560]
The morning will never be the same, all in a ragil, all in vain.

[00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:45.740]
He's a new living morning, he's up over the line, he's got the battle rim in, there's seen such a pride.

[00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:59.520]
The morning will never be the same, all in a ragil, all in vain.

[00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:06.380]
All in a ragil, all in vain.

[00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:15.240]
All in a ragil, all in vain.

[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:20.620]
Thank you Elvis.

[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:24.680]
I can't hold it that long, I can't hold it that long.

[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:30.120]
It's 745 on Zeta 4, that's Elvis Jr. and never sounding better, right?

[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:34.360]
They had an Elvis impersonator with the fare, but I don't think it was him.

[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:36.300]
You don't think it was Elvis Jr.

[00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:41.260]
No, because it seemed like a bigger guy, he's kind of like a small guy, you've met him, haven't you?

[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.780]
Yes I have, good guy.

[00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:44.020]
I like him.

[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:47.940]
And for a minute I thought it was him, because the guy was pretty good, but I don't think it was him.

[00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:49.560]
Well this guy doesn't look like Elvis.

[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:50.920]
No, he's sound like Elvis.

[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:53.140]
Well, any of these guys they like make up and look like him.

[00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:58.300]
Yeah, and he could probably do that, but the guy was too big, to be E.J.

[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:03.340]
Some of them went out of the knife and had plastic surgery to look like Elvis.

[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:03.680]
And that was a knife.

[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:04.400]
Yes.

[00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:05.820]
Interesting choice of words.

[00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.580]
Wait a minute, who is that that's just what running out there again?

[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.760]
Was that that same maniac A.M. salesman again?

[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.680]
Probably, and more people are coming in to the compound.

[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:15.460]
Well, are they coming into the compound?

[00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:20.160]
Well sure, it's nice seeing you folks, so we were here on Friday, we were here on Thanksgiving Day.

[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.440]
It sure is nice seeing some of you come back to work again.

[00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:22.860]
Some.

[00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:27.800]
Yeah, now you'll have something to be thankful for again, next Thanksgiving Day, if you're still here.

[00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:31.080]
Who's coming in, anybody we know?

[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:33.620]
I can't tell you Tony Prado here yet, with her sauce.

[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:35.760]
No, it's the car wash people.

[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:40.940]
Oh great, those are some of my favorite folks, although I did wash my car yesterday, so I will pass.

[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:42.160]
Now who's behind the car wash?

[00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:43.560]
Sales people.

[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.440]
Here goes another one.

[00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:49.680]
Now that looks like what that looks like Jean Cashman.

[00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:51.100]
Now there he goes, he's leaving.

[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:52.740]
Didn't that look like Jean, who's leaving?

[00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:53.980]
The A.M. sales nut.

[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.500]
Gary, Gary.

[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:57.020]
Isn't his name Gary?

[00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:57.820]
Lawrence?

[00:38:58.160 --> 00:38:58.380]
No.

[00:38:58.740 --> 00:38:59.620]
Gary Lawrence is leaving?

[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:00.640]
I'm totally confused.

[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:02.040]
He just got here and he's leaving already.

[00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:04.660]
Okay, well, Lawrence family is listening.

[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.380]
Boy, you believe they gave us a window?

[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:08.760]
I don't know if they love it.

[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:09.500]
Yeah, I love it.

[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.080]
And you know that they hate it.

[00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:12.280]
These people can't stand it.

[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.220]
In fact, they were sitting here monitoring that.

[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:16.480]
Yeah.

[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:17.100]
Bye-bye.

[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:18.560]
Okay, you too.

[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:19.360]
Little hyper.

[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:20.620]
Oh, him or me.

[00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:22.780]
Yeah, he was a little hyper, but can't turn me off though.

[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:23.620]
That is a good guy.

[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:25.740]
And pretty soon we'll get somebody called in to turn me on.

[00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:26.540]
That would be a good start.

[00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:28.280]
You believe he lived in this town?

[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:28.680]
You know what I mean?

[00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:32.180]
Like, I don't want to troll on the year like Stan Major, but it's getting to the point

[00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:32.460]
now.

[00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:36.180]
If something really exciting doesn't happen soon, I'm going to have, I'm going to go to

[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:37.580]
Sweden and have that operation.

[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:38.380]
Finally.

[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:38.840]
Yeah.

[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:39.400]
Okay.

[00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:42.240]
Will we be doing the show?

[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:45.980]
I don't know, but I might sound a little different when I come back.

[00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:48.340]
I might sound like Michael Jackson.

[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:52.400]
But I just, you know, sooner or later something's going to happen.

[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:53.900]
Something good.

[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:55.120]
Something good.

[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:56.640]
I mean, why did that happen at the circus?

[00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:02.040]
Why couldn't I have been, for example, in Windixie?

[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:07.220]
And as I went around the corner of one of the aisles with my shopping cart, I could have

[00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:08.780]
run into that same individual.

[00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:09.900]
That's correct.

[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:13.680]
And at that point, if he would have probably would have been alone, and I would have said,

[00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:18.440]
gee, that would you, it's a good time for something.

[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:19.900]
But not me.

[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:20.600]
That's not my luck.

[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:23.660]
I turn around and there he is with his very attractive young lady, by the way.

[00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:24.480]
She was very nice.

[00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:26.500]
It is so hot in here.

[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:27.500]
It's not my imagination.

[00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:28.960]
And you know what I don't understand?

[00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:33.940]
When we played Mitch Ryder, I went out in the hall and in the atrium, and it's like freezing

[00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:34.240]
out.

[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:34.560]
I know.

[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:37.900]
But there is no air where it's got to be comfortable.

[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:39.240]
Don't you people understand it?

[00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:41.080]
You manage, you mismanagement people.

[00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:42.600]
It's got to be comfortable.

[00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:44.560]
You've got to be able to breathe to be on the air.

[00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:45.200]
Really?

[00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:46.480]
And they just, well, it helps.

[00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:47.620]
It does help.

[00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:53.780]
You know, it never hindered Alan Courtney that he wasn't breathing all those years when he was on the air.

[00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:58.520]
But most of us, it does help if you're breathing a little bit while you're on the air.

[00:40:58.600 --> 00:40:59.000]
A little bit.

[00:40:59.140 --> 00:40:59.340]
Yeah.

[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:01.920]
I mean, it doesn't bother Bill Ross on Channel 7.

[00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:04.360]
He hasn't breathing for 15 years.

[00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:07.540]
Barnaby Jones gets his man.

[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:09.200]
Oh, jeez.

[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:09.820]
Oh.

[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:13.860]
29 past eight on Zeta 4, and where are we going to take a call from?

[00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:14.280]
Boca.

[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:15.280]
Boy, this is pretty exciting.

[00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:15.780]
Hello.

[00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:16.660]
Good morning, Neil.

[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:17.080]
How are you doing?

[00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:17.760]
Good, how are you?

[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:20.920]
This is everybody, the guy with the Hungarian girlfriend, John Colony from Boca.

[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:21.380]
Oh, yeah.

[00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:21.900]
How you been?

[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:22.740]
All right, listen.

[00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:25.440]
I sent you a little something through the mail yesterday.

[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:26.700]
You should get it within a couple days.

[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.780]
I know you're a big Michigan State fan.

[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:32.900]
A friend of mine went up there to watch the big game against Indiana a couple weeks back.

[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.680]
I told him to bring me up a program.

[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:37.520]
And when I got my hands on it, I immediately sent it to you.

[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:38.920]
I know you like Michigan State.

[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:39.940]
I hope you enjoy it.

[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:40.140]
Great.

[00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:42.940]
Along with that program, I sent a cassette for the bird.

[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:46.180]
It's going to be in a big envelope, you know, a UPS, whatever.

[00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:47.620]
I want to ask you something.

[00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:47.880]
What?

[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:49.180]
Wait a minute.

[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.340]
You mean like a blank cassette?

[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:51.360]
Oh, of course.

[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:52.000]
Oh, good.

[00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:55.180]
A lot of go right in the right of my waste basket.

[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:57.880]
I told you not to send me any of those.

[00:41:57.900 --> 00:41:58.660]
No, don't.

[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:00.760]
Don't listen to them.

[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:02.060]
On that first cassette, Neil.

[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.300]
Send those tapes in, folks.

[00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:03.360]
Yeah.

[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:04.220]
Wait a minute, Neil, Neil, Neil.

[00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:05.060]
Is there what?

[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:06.480]
Wasted away on Halndale.

[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:07.520]
Is that on your first cassette?

[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:07.940]
Yes.

[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:08.960]
Thank God.

[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:14.460]
I'm trying to get that desperately trying to get that waste away from Halndale song on there.

[00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:15.320]
And another thing.

[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:20.320]
It always seems every day I listen to you guys that the next day it's hard to say.

[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:23.100]
It's hard for me to realize that the show gets better and better.

[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:27.780]
You seem to go one step above than the day before, but completely so.

[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:31.460]
I can't imagine how you guys keep topping yourself day after day.

[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:34.240]
We're climbing so high pretty soon, the show will be on Mount Rushmore.

[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:35.180]
Yeah.

[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:37.240]
And I know that Jean Cashman can relate to that.

[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:38.460]
Take care and enjoy the magazine.

[00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:39.300]
Have a great day.

[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:42.160]
And hopefully, let us know what goes on at that meeting tomorrow.

[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:42.780]
Okay.

[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:43.980]
We'll get you the inside scoop.

[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:44.480]
See you later.

[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:45.800]
It's not Jean Cashman.

[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:46.920]
I apologize to Jean.

[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:49.160]
It's Arlene Ross, who's butt.

[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:51.280]
Is he picked it up on Mount Rushmore?

[00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:53.620]
I don't like the way Captain David's laughing a lot of noise.

[00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:55.720]
He wants to see it and know he's here.

[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:56.320]
Yeah, no, I like that.

[00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:59.120]
It's a morning show and we want to keep the audience alert and awake.

[00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:00.700]
Now, who's driving it in that vehicle?

[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:01.480]
What is that?

[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:03.000]
Wow.

[00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:03.780]
Fisinder.

[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:06.200]
Pretty strange stuff that comes into this building.

[00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:06.820]
You know?

[00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:09.220]
Most of it is guests on the J-Michael show.

[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:14.640]
How do I feel for the station on my radio?

[00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:18.940]
Wait till the book comes out, check.

[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:21.360]
Not for the locked in, David.

[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:24.300]
What's there major on my radio?

[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:27.140]
All together now, everybody.

[00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:36.660]
I guess you say W-I-N-C-2-D.

[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:37.840]
I don't think so.

[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:39.000]
It's eight.

[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:40.660]
Can you believe that?

[00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:42.920]
I come in for those of you who missed the beginning of the show.

[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:45.060]
And I realize this is a little in.

[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:45.740]
Okay.

[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:52.380]
But I think if you stop, somebody who's listening to me for a while,

[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.900]
if you stop and think about this, it'll give you an idea of how totally confused and chaotic

[00:43:57.900 --> 00:43:59.300]
and screwed up this place is.

[00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:03.720]
I come in here this morning and I always come in the side door through the newsroom

[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:06.300]
because that's the only place you really can get in.

[00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:09.100]
And anyway, what's his name again?

[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:10.380]
Dave Reynolds.

[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:12.760]
I don't know why I keep forgetting his name.

[00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:16.780]
But the David, speaking of our good friend, there he is ladies and gentlemen.

[00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:17.600]
J-J-L-M-J.

[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:19.240]
Wait a minute.

[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:20.400]
We have to wait with the story.

[00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:22.720]
Talking about Stamina J.

[00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:25.200]
Because J just drove up.

[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.700]
But anyway, I come in and Dave Reynolds is there and he says,

[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:28.720]
and he's a pretty good guy.

[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:30.860]
And he says, good morning and I told him, hey, yeah.

[00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:33.780]
And he says, by the way, over by the sports,

[00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:37.380]
there's a green copy thing there for you.

[00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:38.900]
And I think that's a spot for you.

[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:43.860]
And immediately, that puzzled me because why would a spot that has anything to do

[00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:48.080]
with the station with Zeta be in the AM newsroom?

[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:48.460]
Okay.

[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:53.960]
And I go over and I look at it and it's a spot for mineral ice for the AM.

[00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:56.740]
I mean, obviously we are not running mineral ice spots on Zeta.

[00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:59.120]
Okay. And I don't think it's going to start between now and next look is.

[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:02.840]
And it says Neil Tericott.

[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:07.740]
Neil doesn't work on WINZ anymore.

[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:09.880]
I mean, are those people out of their cut and picking minds?

[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:11.600]
Maybe they don't realize.

[00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:15.900]
See, before I left over there, there were some spots that I cut in my voice,

[00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:17.360]
which they have continued to run.

[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:20.840]
And there were some other ones that we did for here that they took a dub of

[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:22.220]
and they played on the air up there.

[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:24.260]
Dub of and they played on the air up there.

[00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:25.620]
But that's it.

[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.340]
I don't work for that station.

[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:28.460]
I have nothing to do with that.

[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:29.160]
Thank God.

[00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:31.760]
I have nothing to do with WINZ anymore.

[00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:33.040]
And I mean, nothing.

[00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:36.840]
Well, I want to disavow any association with that part of the building.

[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:38.180]
Why don't you ask Jay Michaels?

[00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:41.000]
And then when I'm finished doing that, I want to disavow any association

[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.080]
with this part of the building.

[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:45.060]
No, Jay's the production director on the AM.

[00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:46.300]
Well, I don't think it was his writing.

[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:47.580]
I know, but why don't you ask him?

[00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:48.340]
He would know better.

[00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:49.840]
He knows that I'm not going to do that.

[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:50.120]
Right.

[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:51.800]
There's not a chance in 10 million.

[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:53.380]
Well, when he pops in over here.

[00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:56.700]
Well, I saw him with his briefcase and his party, just came in.

[00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:58.060]
Did he have his red pants?

[00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:00.080]
And his red pants and his chemistry set.

[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:02.540]
It's 834 or a Zeta 4.

[00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:08.400]
You know, there's a guy in my complex who has a little dog, Doug.

[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:12.860]
And he walks this, he drags this dog around all day.

[00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:17.360]
And you remember me talking about the guy Wain who called in and turned out to be a pretty decent guy.

[00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:19.500]
But Wain is like out there all day.

[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:20.960]
All day.

[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:21.760]
I don't know if he works.

[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:22.860]
I don't know what his story is.

[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:26.940]
But this guy is not only outside of it, but he's walking that dog.

[00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:30.100]
Anytime more, you can come at three in the mornings now walking that dog.

[00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:36.080]
So I kind of thought we could have, and not only that, but I have two other neighbors who are very nice people

[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:40.560]
on the other side of where I live, who are obsessed with washing their car.

[00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:43.960]
I mean, it's way, you know, I like to keep my car clean when I get a chance.

[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:48.560]
But it's something to be obsessed with washing your car.

[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:49.160]
Okay.

[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:53.080]
In fact, if you open up my door and I walk out front and hear car wash blues, like 15 hours a day.

[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:58.500]
And they're out there scrubbing and waxing and polishing and waxing and scrubbing and ripping and tearing.

[00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:03.680]
And I thought it would make, we could make an interesting movie in my complex.

[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:10.020]
You know, here it would be Wain wandering around looking like Harry Reams, you know, with all that furball all over his body.

[00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:12.340]
Just wandering around aimlessly being a Yenta.

[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:23.060]
And here'd be this guy dragging this poor little dog on a leash, you know, and then there would be my other friend who's like the space cadet wandering around aimlessly looking like somebody who's been in the house.

[00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:24.300]
And you've got lost from the Harry Christmas.

[00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:28.420]
And then the other people washing, frantically washing up the store.

[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:29.760]
Man, it's what a scene.

[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.960]
But you left out my favorite character.

[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:33.240]
Which one is that in the movie?

[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:37.580]
Well, the guy who runs out into the parking lot and the second he sees you come out, you're doing it.

[00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:40.880]
No, that's the same guy who wanders around like the space cadet.

[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:41.600]
That's him.

[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:42.960]
Like a space cadet.

[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:44.400]
Yeah, he's like a wandering Jew.

[00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:46.740]
Yeah, and what does he yell out?

[00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:47.620]
Oh, yeah.

[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:51.440]
Like different Yiddish word that are totally disconnected like...

[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:53.180]
Get filter face.

[00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:54.400]
Tuckers.

[00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:55.960]
Out of the blue.

[00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:58.560]
Yeah, Coxa Huis, you know, little cuties.

[00:47:58.840 --> 00:47:59.540]
At the top of his love.

[00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:01.160]
Yeah, they'd have nothing to do with anything.

[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:03.960]
Sim Costa Tishubov.

[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:05.620]
Why don't we write a screenplay?

[00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:06.940]
Yeah, I'm Tonya.

[00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:09.340]
I think we've got the cash already set.

[00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:10.680]
I think there's a lot of potential there.

[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:12.020]
We could call it complex.

[00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:12.800]
Yeah.

[00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:16.900]
And Richard Dreyfus could star as you.

[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:21.060]
We could river Phoenix.

[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:22.160]
Yeah, we would be great.

[00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:23.480]
River Phoenix could play my roommate.

[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:26.220]
Yeah, no, I don't think so.

[00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:29.420]
836 on Zeta 4 and where should we go next?

[00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:31.100]
He asked to line for it.

[00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:34.420]
Isn't it amazing that we did the show just keeps going on and on and on and on.

[00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:37.340]
I mean, are we making up for lost time now or what?

[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:39.220]
It just, oh, there she is.

[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:41.180]
Hey, by the way, I got a little present for you, sure.

[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:42.560]
Write me some copy.

[00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:42.980]
Will you honey?

[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:44.760]
I'll be more than happy to do that one of these days.

[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:46.040]
But get serious.

[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:47.620]
Well, I just thought it was an endorsement spot.

[00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:48.960]
Well, I got news for you.

[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:50.000]
I don't write copy.

[00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:53.480]
You know, the first time I did a magnificent job, but when I get pushed, I start getting

[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:53.920]
testing.

[00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:55.540]
And what about that spot for the AM?

[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:56.660]
I had nothing to do with it.

[00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:58.260]
I mean, can you believe, did you hear that story?

[00:48:58.400 --> 00:48:58.860]
Yeah, I heard it.

[00:48:58.860 --> 00:48:59.660]
I come in this morning.

[00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:01.840]
Here's a spot for me to recut for INZ.

[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:02.760]
I don't work at INZ.

[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:03.920]
I know.

[00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:05.400]
I have nothing to do with INZ.

[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:07.240]
I don't want anything to do with that station.

[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:08.040]
Can you give you yellow sheets?

[00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:08.660]
Not green one.

[00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:09.440]
Yeah, okay.

[00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:10.440]
Oh, that's the difference.

[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:11.580]
Write me some copy, please.

[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:12.780]
She's messed up.

[00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:14.260]
I'm too much hanky-panky with Paul.

[00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:15.160]
I'm John.

[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:16.760]
And I got news for you.

[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:17.860]
Nothing's ever going to come of that.

[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:18.640]
Okay.

[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:20.540]
Where are we going next, Broward County?

[00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:20.880]
Hello.

[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:22.200]
I know what it is.

[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:23.180]
What it is?

[00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:24.300]
Got Tony.

[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:25.400]
I got some hot, Joe.

[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:27.460]
What you be, man?

[00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:29.100]
You know, you got some hot stuff?

[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:30.200]
Hot stuff, man.

[00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:30.480]
Okay.

[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:31.420]
Well, you bring it in about what?

[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:34.380]
We're having a big sale two in the morning tomorrow morning.

[00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:35.960]
I got the best deal in town.

[00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:36.780]
Oh, wait a minute.

[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:37.200]
Wait a minute.

[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:38.040]
I got to watch here.

[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:38.920]
Let me take a look at it.

[00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:40.620]
Let me take a look at this.

[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:45.700]
It's a cycle from JC Pennings.

[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:46.420]
Okay.

[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.400]
It was about $2.29.

[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:50.800]
I did it.

[00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:51.760]
Not $200.

[00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:52.300]
Not $200.

[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:54.220]
Oh, that's good because it's only $2.29.

[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:55.620]
Okay.

[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:57.020]
Oh, man, you jive.

[00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:59.080]
I'm not being jive, and you'll be ill, sir.

[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:02.660]
The pet Tony, I'll be over there with the good selection.

[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:03.360]
Okay.

[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:04.360]
All right, down.

[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:04.920]
See y'all.

[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:08.080]
That's somebody called from the Thunderbird and the fly market.

[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:08.420]
Yeah.

[00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:08.620]

[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:10.600]
And the flea market.

[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:11.080]
Yeah, that's really good.

[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:14.720]
We need just one, and that's to tie around Tony Prado's neck.

[00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:16.000]
What's up, man?

[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:18.480]
I mean, oh, my God, I didn't recognize him.

[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:18.960]
Elvis.

[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:20.120]
That's Elvis Jr.

[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:20.600]

[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:23.840]
Put Elvis over here for a minute, and let's put him on first.

[00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:24.840]
I didn't recognize you.

[00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:25.740]
It's been so long.

[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:26.180]
I know.

[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:30.040]
You weren't at the Broward County Fair, were you?

[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:32.740]
No, but I was one of my daddy's design personators.

[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:33.340]
Yeah, I saw him.

[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:34.160]
He was pretty good.

[00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:34.760]
It was really.

[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:36.460]
Yeah, not as good as you, but he was good.

[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:39.140]
I have a cartoon to show you, Elvis Jr.

[00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:40.700]
in this morning's USA Today.

[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:45.340]
Did you guys happen to catch this week's National Inquirer?

[00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:45.740]
Oh, yeah.

[00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:48.820]
He was reading it on the area yesterday.

[00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:51.700]
And it kind of runs parallel with the tapes that you got.

[00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:54.200]
Something about my daddy talking from his grave.

[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:57.220]
Yeah, that's what this cartoon can get upset about that.

[00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:59.120]
Yeah, read that cartoon in USA Today.

[00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:01.020]
I think we have a grave situation, don't you?

[00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:05.640]
That was good.

[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:06.560]
By what to say?

[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:07.200]
Yeah.

[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:09.060]
Now your daddy was big on jewelry, Elvis.

[00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:10.120]
Every day cartoon.

[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:11.920]
You think about some story of my life.

[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:14.580]
I was visited by the ghost of an Elvis impersonator.

[00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:18.360]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:19.300]
Jewry.

[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:22.440]
I've heard about this woman coming in here to sell jewelry.

[00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:23.560]
Yeah, great.

[00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:24.200]
Oh, yeah.

[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:24.700]
I think I'll call it.

[00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:26.800]
Some of your daddy's jewelry, maybe, in a collection button.

[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:28.460]
I'll make a special trip to come in here.

[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:29.720]
I'll make you a star.

[00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:33.940]
I had to make a special trip this morning to come in because I'm coming in the cut of spots.

[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:41.140]
I don't think I don't want to replace anything that you guys have done because I think that is the spot that you guys have done for the brick oven,

[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:43.300]
I think that should go into the archives.

[00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:43.720]
Oh, yeah.

[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:47.620]
Maybe you like to cut this mineralized spot that they got up there, Elvis.

[00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:53.040]
I think the spot that the bird did for the brick oven is.

[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:54.400]
I think that you go into the archives.

[00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:57.020]
Yeah, my favorite is where he says a slight of Pete.

[00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:58.100]
That's my favorite.

[00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:00.960]
You can't get close to it, but you'll never...

[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:01.480]
Nobody can do that.

[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:02.420]
I don't think I could ever do that.

[00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:02.720]
No.

[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:04.640]
And I don't even hope to replace that.

[00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:06.380]
I wouldn't think as long as you know that.

[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:07.200]
I think it should go into the archives.

[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:08.020]
So what are you really doing here?

[00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:09.660]
You're hanging around for Stan Major's at it.

[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:13.000]
Is he milking another free performance off of you today?

[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:13.560]
Not quite.

[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:14.920]
I'm actually in here to do a spot.

[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:16.620]
I've done a lot of work over there.

[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:18.860]
And I really...

[00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:21.260]
I'm still living in the phone booth, so I have to make money somehow.

[00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:24.560]
So I'm coming in here to do a spot.

[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:26.660]
I wonder how he takes those showers in that phone booth.

[00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:28.720]
The ones that he calls in on the air with the Michelle.

[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:29.280]
Oh, yeah.

[00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:29.820]
Remember Michelle?

[00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:30.720]
No, that's not Michelle.

[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:31.740]
Her name is Suzanne.

[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:33.140]
And you've got...

[00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:34.480]
Her name used to be Michelle.

[00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:36.140]
You've got me into a lot of trouble there, buddy.

[00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:36.520]
Oh, I see.

[00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:37.500]
Oh, really?

[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:40.960]
So in other words, we have a little change of characters.

[00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:42.120]
Some of you know what I'm saying.

[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:42.960]
Sort of speak, yeah.

[00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:43.560]
Hmm.

[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:44.780]
That interesting.

[00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:47.520]
Do you think Stan will be upset that you dropped in here?

[00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:48.280]
Perfume in it?

[00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:49.400]
I'm really worried, you know what I'm saying?

[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:49.960]

[00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:51.600]
He may not like that.

[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:54.220]
I think we ought to play in honor of Elvis's appearance here.

[00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:56.460]
I think we ought to play that one straight one.

[00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:57.620]
Straight?

[00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:58.720]
That he could have even pardoned that expression.

[00:52:58.720 --> 00:52:59.800]
Yeah, what do you talk about?

[00:52:59.800 --> 00:52:59.800]

[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:00.420]
Don't be cruel.

[00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:01.980]
I think that's what he was.

[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:03.820]
I didn't even know that was being recorded.

[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:07.260]
That was right after we did the Stan majors.

[00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:08.640]
Don't be cruel version.

[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:11.100]
And I think I forgot one of the verses.

[00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:12.560]
Yeah, that's what we like about it.

[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:14.660]
He said you just sort of go away for a few minutes.

[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:15.480]
I will like that.

[00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:17.040]
You should change when I go away.

[00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:17.460]
That's nice.

[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:18.560]
Well, just for a minute.

[00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:19.620]
There's a few people like that.

[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:21.200]
No, no, just for a minute.

[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:24.060]
Don't tell me that it disappeared because that would be...

[00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:26.360]
That would be so obvious as to where it went if it disappeared.

[00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:28.080]
Well, you couldn't even figure that one out of.

[00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:28.500]

[00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:31.860]
How could that be possible?

[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:34.420]
Well, he was talking the other day about coming by here

[00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:37.640]
and just kind of walking by the studio and it was unlocked.

[00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:38.620]
Yeah, I heard that.

[00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:38.620]

[00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:39.180]
He said he didn't come in.

[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:40.540]
Yeah, he said that.

[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:41.660]
Yeah, that was yesterday.

[00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:43.940]
But you would have to believe him, wouldn't you?

[00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:44.340]
No.

[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:48.540]
Where the hell is that?

[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:51.680]
Well...

[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:52.280]
I'll tell you one thing.

[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:55.160]
If that disappeared, I'm going to be apple-plugged.

[00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:55.660]
Mm-hmm.

[00:53:57.740 --> 00:53:58.760]
I think it's gone.

[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:05.300]
Yeah, keep playing that in the background there because I can't find this card.

[00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:10.500]
I've got it. It's Neil or never. I've got that.

[00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:11.160]
But that's...

[00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:14.280]
Where the hell could that have gone to?

[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:14.900]
And though I do.

[00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:18.760]
Do you have a special rack over there for El with Junior?

[00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:20.240]
Yeah.

[00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:22.920]
Do we have a special rack for Don Jun?

[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:23.740]
Yeah, Don Jun.

[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:25.740]
Did you happen to listen to the show of things given?

[00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:27.200]
I missed that.

[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:27.740]
You did.

[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:30.160]
Yeah, we're kind of busy with family, you know.

[00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:31.360]
I'm Neil, did you eat the bird?

[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:32.380]
Yeah, I'm sure.

[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:32.620]
Yeah, I'm sure.

[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:33.900]
Yeah, stuff the bird.

[00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:37.680]
You guys were in there together?

[00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:38.900]
Sorry, I missed that.

[00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:39.880]
Yeah, we were there together.

[00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:40.380]
No.

[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:42.020]
It was interesting.

[00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:44.000]
Is that the word you want to use?

[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:45.340]
Yeah, it was interesting.

[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:45.920]
Interesting.

[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:49.740]
And another friend of Stan's was there his friend...

[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:51.460]
...his girlfriend.

[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:52.240]
Don't say it.

[00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:54.600]
Don't say it.

[00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:58.140]
Yeah, which one?

[00:54:58.560 --> 00:54:59.060]
Trust me.

[00:54:59.220 --> 00:54:59.680]
Yeah, I know.

[00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:00.580]
It's gone.

[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:04.380]
So, Elvis, Junior.

[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:07.380]
Do you ever see my friend Corey James?

[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:08.760]
Yeah, I've seen him quite often.

[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:14.560]
I haven't seen him in the past month or so, but I've seen him up until the time I talked to you.

[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:17.320]
I told you to say that he said hi to you.

[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:17.940]
Good guy.

[00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:20.760]
I hear him on commercials and I see him on my cable TV.

[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:22.020]
Yeah, he's doing eight.

[00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:27.700]
In fact, he did one of those live television spots a few weeks ago during one of the Saturday football games.

[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:28.720]
Live.

[00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:32.060]
Yeah, the live spots from the Tammy Amitriot where they had the same sound.

[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:32.880]
They cut him short.

[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:33.620]
Which was pretty interesting.

[00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:34.680]
I kept Dave Sawd.

[00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:35.780]
He said they cut him short.

[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:38.320]
Did they cut him off at the end or something?

[00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:39.300]
Well, I didn't see it.

[00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:43.480]
I really didn't see every one of them, but the ones that I saw he did pretty good on.

[00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:44.120]
Well, that's good.

[00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:45.100]
Oh, yeah, he did a good job.

[00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:46.120]
That is working.

[00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:47.220]
You cannot find that.

[00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:48.080]
Oh, God.

[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:50.340]
And I played it a couple of times because I was so impressed.

[00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:52.920]
Remember, I played it twice that one morning because it was really great.

[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:54.080]
Yeah, I did hear it.

[00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:54.620]
I did hear it.

[00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:55.720]
You played it just the other day.

[00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:56.000]
Gone.

[00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:57.760]
I'm telling you, it's not in here.

[00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:58.880]
You played it just the other day.

[00:55:58.980 --> 00:55:59.300]
I know.

[00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:00.760]
What's it?

[00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:01.560]
What's it saying on the way?

[00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:03.040]
It says don't be cruel, Elvis Jr.

[00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:04.940]
What do you think it says?

[00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:05.720]
I don't know.

[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:06.840]
I don't know.

[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:07.800]
CCR?

[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:08.320]
Yeah.

[00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:08.920]
Yeah.

[00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:09.960]
That's what I thought it said.

[00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:11.700]
One of it has something to do with a door being open.

[00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:12.780]
Yeah.

[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:14.360]
Peter, are you idiot?

[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:16.760]
Eugene Cashman said to say hi when I got in here.

[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:17.360]
Oh, good.

[00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:19.780]
One of my favorite people.

[00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:21.240]
It's gone.

[00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:21.920]
I'm just looking.

[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:23.940]
She dropped in here Thanksgiving day.

[00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:25.160]
I did she really incredible.

[00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:26.860]
Well, she did the show right after you guys.

[00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:27.100]
Thanks.

[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:28.160]
Mm-hmm.

[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:28.720]
And she dropped in.

[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:30.340]
She told me that she loves to follow Neil.

[00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:31.380]
Whatever that means.

[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:35.580]
Let's analyze that statement.

[00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:36.240]
What do you say?

[00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:38.060]
Yeah, let's not analyze it at all.

[00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:40.060]
Well, it's gone, Elvis.

[00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:42.300]
I was just itching to play it.

[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:42.600]
Sorry.

[00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:43.560]
Long gone.

[00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:46.740]
So you're going to have to talk to your buddy about what happened to it.

[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:47.020]
Yeah.

[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:47.520]
Disappeared.

[00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:48.600]
I'll bring it up with him.

[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:50.180]
I definitely will sort of speak.

[00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:50.600]
Yeah.

[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:51.880]
Okay.

[00:56:52.140 --> 00:56:53.180]
Well, listen, what can I say?

[00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:55.180]
It's certainly exciting having Elvis here.

[00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:56.540]
We've got our jewelry sale coming up.

[00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:57.660]
Things are really happening.

[00:56:58.100 --> 00:56:58.940]
One more could you want.

[00:56:58.960 --> 00:56:59.740]
Things are really happening.

[00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:00.800]
I'll say it for her, aren't they?

[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:01.440]
Oh, good more.

[00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:02.180]
Okay.

[00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:03.400]
Should we take a caller or two here?

[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:03.800]
Sure.

[00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:04.320]
Okay.

[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:07.120]
By the way, we did lose somebody in date County.

[00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:10.720]
It was probably the guy stole the cart 620 3600.

[00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:13.380]
Date County.

[00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:13.680]
Hello.

[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:14.240]
Deal.

[00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:14.660]
Yeah.

[00:57:14.820 --> 00:57:16.640]
This is Jeff Strecker's press agent here.

[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:17.740]
Yes, Jeff Jr.

[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:21.200]
And he would like to know if you could play a song for him, he's kind of busy right now.

[00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:23.520]
He'd like to hear Stroke Me by Billy Squire.

[00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:24.140]
Really?

[00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:25.260]
How many would?

[00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:27.340]
And on behalf of Jeff and he'll make a lot.

[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:28.240]
Oh, yeah.

[00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:29.420]
Oh, yeah.

[00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:29.820]
Okay.

[00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:30.380]
Good luck to you.

[00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:32.520]
I think he's more than his agent.

[00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:33.500]
I'll tell you that right now.

[00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:34.880]
That was excellent.

[00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:35.180]
Yeah.

[00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:36.940]
I think he was calling from our doctor's office.

[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:39.140]
You know which one I'm talking about, don't you?

[00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:40.620]
But what doctor would that be?

[00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:40.740]
I don't know.

[00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:40.740]

[00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:40.740]

[00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:41.220]
Okay.

[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:42.980]
Let's move on.

[00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:46.080]
Number two, it seems like just moments ago we took number two.

[00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:50.660]
Since he put that painter's hand on it, he's been as useless as ears on a frog, you know.

[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:52.260]
Trying to answer these hot phones.

[00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:52.680]
Oh, I know.

[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:53.440]
The phones are hot.

[00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:56.360]
That's because Elvis Jr. is here and everybody made people think of Stan.

[00:57:56.780 --> 00:57:57.180]
Yeah.

[00:57:57.180 --> 00:57:57.820]
And I'm saying that.

[00:57:58.480 --> 00:57:58.880]
Yeah.

[00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:00.260]
That's what we said.

[00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:01.940]
Broward County.

[00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:02.220]
Hello.

[00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:03.700]
Hello.

[00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:04.300]
Hello.

[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:04.880]
Yes, sir.

[00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:05.540]
How are you doing?

[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:05.980]
Okay.

[00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:07.980]
It went ever happen to your CD player.

[00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:09.380]
I had the same problem.

[00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:13.340]
Well, I took it into that place on Griffin Road.

[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:13.860]
Yeah.

[00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:14.680]
That place.

[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.200]
And they said in a day or two, it's going to be just like new.

[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:19.080]
How did they say they're going to fix it?

[00:58:19.340 --> 00:58:23.220]
Well, they didn't exactly tear it apart and show me all the, you know, what they were going to do.

[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:23.880]
I have no idea.

[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:25.480]
The beam needs to be adjusted.

[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:26.100]
Uh.

[00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:26.980]
It's like this show.

[00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:27.920]
It's a little off beam.

[00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:29.740]
You're not going to give it away on the show.

[00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:30.920]
No, I don't think so.

[00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:34.460]
You buy the quality products like Stan, your buddy Stan does.

[00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:35.100]
Like, what is it?

[00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:35.540]
Emerson?

[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:36.360]
Emerson.

[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:36.920]
Yeah.

[00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:37.500]
Yeah.

[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:39.260]
And I feel like I like filtering.

[00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:39.760]
So.

[00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:40.660]
Yeah.

[00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:45.060]
If I get myself a new stereo, I'm definitely going to get a filter or maybe a K-Tel.

[00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:45.660]
Yeah.

[00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:47.100]
Uh.

[00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:48.180]
Go ahead, sir.

[00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:48.580]
I'm sorry.

[00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:49.380]
Hey, no problem.

[00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:50.380]
No, I had the same problem.

[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:54.320]
And all I did was just shove the, you know how when you press the button, it goes in automatically.

[00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:54.960]
Yeah.

[00:58:55.180 --> 00:58:58.180]
You just shove the thing in by the hand one time and it works great.

[00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:00.360]
No, sir.

[00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:04.180]
You know, it's a quarter to nine in the morning.

[00:59:04.180 --> 00:59:10.080]
It's not even close to those hours that the commission set aside for indecent discussions on a radio.

[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:17.660]
I mean, this is, I don't want to probe too much to find out where you're coming from, but this is getting a little bit personal.

[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:19.320]
All right, I'll keep it clean.

[00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:19.720]
Okay.

[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:22.300]
Hey, Van, away, she makes more than a hundred thousand.

[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:23.200]
Yeah, I think about 120.

[00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:26.340]
Uh, at least she's still in clothes and everything else.

[00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:27.140]
Good job, Elvis.

[00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:28.300]
Okay.

[00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:29.680]
He's always going.

[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:31.380]
Elvis, he'd be going to cut a spot.

[00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:32.220]
Uh, all right.

[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:33.200]
We're not going to hear him sing.

[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:34.840]
Well, I'll have to play the other one.

[00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:37.620]
I have to play the one at the Marriott, but I was hoping to play.

[00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:43.120]
Don't be cruel because it's, uh, as I said, when we played it the other day, it sounds exactly like Elvis.

[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:43.420]
Yeah.

[00:59:44.020 --> 00:59:47.480]
Now, do you have any venture of a guess of what might have happened to that card?

[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:47.800]
Yeah.

[00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:50.100]
I think Jay Michaels got it.

[00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:51.480]
No, you're getting close though.

[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:53.320]
Same, same studio, wrong times.

[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:53.680]

[00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:56.100]
I think it's all right.

[00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:57.540]
His show.

[00:59:57.800 --> 00:59:58.020]
Yeah.

[00:59:58.740 --> 00:59:59.320]
Yeah, it's.

[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:00.080]
Now he's back there.

[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:00.380]
So.

[01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:01.240]
Who says?

[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:03.440]
Oh, you tell me Jay or Stan.

[01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:03.840]
Hey.

[01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:04.440]
Jay.

[01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:06.440]
Oh, Stan says sucks.

[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:11.920]
Oh, boy.

[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:12.960]
This is getting vicious.

[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:13.700]
I like this.

[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:14.280]
Yeah, I like it.

[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:16.360]
Yeah, he comes in here and steals our Elvis card.

[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.280]
It's getting good and vicious.

[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:19.120]
Go ahead, sir.

[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:20.320]
I don't know.

[01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:21.600]
I'm running out of material.

[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:22.760]
Oh, that's it for him.

[01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:24.080]
Yeah, we are too.

[01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:25.020]
All right.

[01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:25.840]
You too, huh?

[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:26.340]
Yeah.

[01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:27.300]
Get out of here, duck.

[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:28.920]
Okay, have a nice day, sir.

[01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:30.020]
But enough is enough.

[01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:31.220]
Oh, I'm going to play the other one.

[01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:31.220]

[01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:31.220]

[01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:31.220]

[01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:31.220]

[01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:34.120]
Okay, it's 849, 848 somewhere around there.

[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:35.100]
It's almost news time.

[01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:36.020]
And I don't know.

[01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:38.680]
These newscasts today have been pretty depressing, pretty morbid.

[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:39.240]
Have they ever?

[01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:41.040]
You know, off of that Mary Alito stuff

[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.340]
and a Cuban immigration deal and all these other, uh,

[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:47.140]
there were a couple of other really morbid into Wall Street, uh, you know,

[01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:48.060]
and trying to ask about that.

[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:49.340]
No, that's depressing.

[01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:50.180]
We're on FM.

[01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:51.480]
Well, I've been trying.

[01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:51.680]
It's about that.

[01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:52.260]
Happy news.

[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:54.900]
You know, just pretend you're Scott Lezier.

[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:56.240]
Like you're a happy simple.

[01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:58.920]
Now, I have to deal with what's available in the news.

[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:00.940]
I yesterday, there was plenty of happy news today.

[01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:02.160]
There's not as much.

[01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:05.160]
Oh, well, maybe if you'd brought the inquire back again today,

[01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:06.600]
we could have some happy news.

[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:10.220]
Well, I do have the inquire, but we used most of the thing.

[01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:12.920]
Of course, that is my Bible, by the way, the National Enquirer.

[01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:16.020]
You know, it'll never lead you wrong.

[01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:18.780]
You're just going to continue to look for that card, right?

[01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:19.660]
Where could it be?

[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:23.960]
Continue and continue and looking over and over these things.

[01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:25.440]
You've already looked through these things.

[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:27.700]
It's not here.

[01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:30.080]
I hear Ellen.

[01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:32.440]
It's 8.49.

[01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:33.780]
Good job, Arlene.

[01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:35.780]
Maybe we can get the current temp here.

[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:37.180]
That was loud and clear.

[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:37.540]
Oh.

[01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:43.200]
You know, some people talk from like the depths of their lungs.

[01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:46.780]
Arlene talks from like the depths of her cheeks.

[01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:49.260]
That's why she's got such a butch voice.

[01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:52.120]
Okay, it's getting close enough to do the news now.

[01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:53.920]
And I apologize, and especially to Elvis,

[01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:54.920]
even though he's in production,

[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:59.280]
I apologize that I cannot find that magnificent cut that he did,

[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:03.100]
because as usual, somebody came in here and got their fingers in the pot.

[01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:06.640]
Well, I think this decides that we locked the studio at 10 a.m.

[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:09.340]
Yeah, and if God's it, I'm like, you know, he's going to have to get his act together.

[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:10.340]
He's been spoiled.

[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:12.820]
He's used to this being just like his library.

[01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:13.800]
You know, he comes in here.

[01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:15.020]
He spins that carousel.

[01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:16.320]
And you know what I'm saying?

[01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:17.040]
Just put it here.

[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.020]
But I have to get his stuff.

[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:19.680]
He's got all kinds of room and erected.

[01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:20.800]
Certainly are no spots.

[01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:23.920]
Neil Rogers, the rock and roll monster.

[01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:26.820]
Okay, that's the news intro, because Elvis was in here.

[01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:29.540]
No, I forgot to put the news intro in here.

[01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:29.940]
That's okay.

[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:31.120]
He's don't like it anyway.

[01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:32.600]
You don't like that anyway.

[01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:33.200]
I hate it.

[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:34.840]
You know, we don't have to use anything.

[01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:36.240]
Would you like that?

[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:37.020]
Sure.

[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:39.920]
Like ABC on some of their networks.

[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:41.820]
Which one is it?

[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:43.220]
Contemporary that they start cold?

[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:43.720]
Yeah.

[01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:45.520]
Would you prefer that?

[01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:45.900]
No.

[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:46.800]
I want to.

[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:48.080]
I'm going to get a new one.

[01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:48.560]
All right.

[01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:52.620]
I'm going to get a new one.

[01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:05.300]
I'm going to get a new one.

[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:11.980]
I'm going to get a new one.

[01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:15.980]
I'm going to get a new one.

[01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:16.000]
I'm going to get a new one.

[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:16.000]

[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:16.000]

[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:16.000]

[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:16.000]

[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:16.000]

[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:16.000]

[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:16.000]

[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:16.080]
I'm going to get a new one.

[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:16.080]

[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:16.080]

[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:16.080]

[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:16.280]
I'm going to get a new one.

[01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:16.480]
I'm going to get a new one.

[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:16.480]

[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:16.480]

[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:22.320]
I'm going to get a new one.

[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:25.980]
I'm going to get a new one.

[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:27.320]
I'm going to get a new one.

[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:27.520]
I'm going to get a new one.

[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:27.520]

[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:27.520]

[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:27.560]
I'm going to get a new one.

[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:27.780]

[01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:29.920]
I'm going to get a new one.

[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:31.380]
I'm going to get a new one.

[01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:32.900]
I'm going to get a new one.

[01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:35.140]
I'm going to get a new one.

[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:38.560]
I'm going to get a new one.

[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:40.600]
I'm going to get a new one.

[01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:44.340]

I'm going to get a new one.

[01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:52.240]
I'm going to get a new one.

[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:54.620]
Hi, Glenn.

[01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:54.940]
Hi.

[01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:58.880]
You said like a blue Zelda, a fissure, not all.

[01:06:59.100 --> 01:06:59.400]
Oh, yeah.

[01:06:59.440 --> 01:06:59.860]
I like it.

[01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:03.400]
I'm just kind of wondering if I've seen the movie about 10 times.

[01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:05.860]
What?

[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:09.620]
You know, nothing to say what was it about, but why?

[01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:12.820]
What kind of a movie was it supposed to represent?

[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:14.080]
Today.

[01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:15.980]
Today.

[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:16.480]

[01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:16.700]

[01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:16.700]

[01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:16.700]

[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:16.880]

[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:17.100]
Today.

[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:18.420]
Today.

[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:19.840]

[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:21.400]
In the movie, you think you're in the 50s, right?

[01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:23.300]
Yeah, but what difference does it make?

[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:25.480]
He has no frame of reference.

[01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:25.880]
Yeah.

[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.960]
Yeah, that's the way David Lynch likes it.

[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:30.880]
He doesn't want you to have a frame of reference.

[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:31.740]
I see.

[01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:33.760]
It's part of the whole mood of the movie.

[01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:35.680]
Now, did you ultimately like the movie?

[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:36.620]
Very much.

[01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:37.120]
Yeah.

[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:37.600]
Me too.

[01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:42.480]
You know, I got hooked on that song, number one blues all over it.

[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:43.300]
I got hooked on it.

[01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:45.460]
Roy Robinson's song, In Dreams.

[01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:46.180]
Uh-huh.

[01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:46.840]
Yeah.

[01:07:46.840 --> 01:08:10.880]
music. It's true. It is. Somebody understood the idea. Yeah. He talked it up. Yeah. That

[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:17.780]
was a good job. Okay. So long. I see he said goodbye and I'm too soon. Now, but that was good. He

[01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:21.840]
understood the movie. Okay. Do you want to check this out after the ID? I think we could have just made

[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:28.180]
radio history. Okay. As he mentioned Roy Orbison. Mm-hmm. Just the only like fit all the pieces together.

[01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:32.360]
Well, that's the only music you know. Because you remember that bag. What was your name? Paddy Murray.

[01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:38.320]
Paddy Murray. Very good memory. Yeah. Memory like a hawk. The only face to match. And all I know is

[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:43.080]
that Roy Orbison, all of us aging jocks. That's right. Okay. Let's do the ID and make it legal.

[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:53.880]
And then we'll see what happened with that car. She wore a pad. Today Bobby Vinton and tomorrow on

[01:08:53.880 --> 01:09:22.300]
the show. Oh, don't keep saying that. Oh, don't keep saying that.

[01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:26.880]
I bet most of the people in the audience didn't recognize the voice from the little boy IDs, but he has

[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:32.980]
these split personality, you know, like 20 different personalities. So like one of them is

[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:41.600]
I wasn't at the same guy. Mm-hmm. But the oldest Harrison one. Uh-oh. What is he doing looking for a

[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:49.900]
job up here? Boy, shame on you. 903 on Zeta 4. Now, let's let this loose. Okay. And see if it was

[01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:58.500]
good. Great. If it was good for us. Mm-hmm. Ah. Walking down the street. Now that would even

[01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:03.220]
impress me. We just made radio history. I would even impress Ricky Tiki. Uh, impress. No,

[01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:07.980]
would depress him because there's no way in the world he could match that. That sounds like you're

[01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:12.940]
on his slickest day. Yeah, you're competing against the master of talkups. It sounds like to me.

[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:19.460]
Yeah. You're trying to show him up and the master of mong. That's it. That's right. Yeah. And you're

[01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:23.540]
doing a hell of a job too. Yeah. We've outdone him at his own game. Mm-hmm. What is he going to do now?

[01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:28.280]
Mm-hmm. Oops. I'm sorry. Wait a minute. That's okay. All right. We don't mind hearing your watch

[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:32.360]
fleet. In fact, I'm going to set mine for like the middle of the show. Ah, I just so every day it

[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:36.480]
goes off at a different time. We don't have time for you to set your watch. I just created it. We

[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:41.160]
don't have time. Oh, well. For you to adjust your time. Hi. As a matter of fact, I got a good idea. Why

[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:46.820]
don't you just ditch that one? Because on the 11th of December and just 10 days Tony Prado has got this

[01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:51.340]
hot jewelry coming in here from the flea market. Yeah. Read that memo, Ryan. I read that. I read

[01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:56.460]
that on here. That is one of the most embarrassing memos in the history of the broadcast industry.

[01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:02.460]
Sure to go down to the anals of broadcasting. Now wait a minute. Who's that? Is that Michael Mendes?

[01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:05.760]
Yeah. Who's used to work here? And Tony is here. Oh, and Tony's here too.

[01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:10.580]
Cars here. Oh, that's great. I wonder what she's selling today. What are they peddling in Tony's

[01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:15.180]
office today? That's the question, ladies and gentlemen. Watch all the call in the business

[01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:19.920]
office right now. Do we know what the numbers are here? We've been on for eight weeks. I have no idea.

[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:25.960]
The business number. But the business number is for Zulu. Let's see. I don't have the I&Z business number.

[01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:34.400]
6246101. Yeah. 6246101. Indeed. Ask what merchandise is being sold at the winds Zeta.

[01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:40.780]
What are we called indoor flea market? I guess that's a trend for. Yeah. They might have some really

[01:11:40.780 --> 01:11:45.300]
good hot stuff and give you some great bargains before Christmas time. And the God only knows we're

[01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:49.500]
not giving any any on the log because on both stations it looks like we are out of business.

[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:54.300]
Yeah. Right. Well, hey listen, it's only 24 days before Christmas. Just told your breath in

[01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:58.480]
a way. It's going to get a lot better. Well, I actually I kind of like this. It gives you sort

[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:03.640]
of a feeling of what it's like to work for, you know, public radio. Welcome to WLRN, which I

[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:07.740]
never had experienced before. Seriously, I've never seen anything like this in my life. This is

[01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:12.200]
mind boggling. And they're going to have a meeting and give us some kind of instruction. I have no

[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:18.140]
idea. They're going to talk to us like they know something. Yeah. What do they know? Well,

[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:23.500]
I carry Lawrence, man. You should have heard his calls here this morning. He's losing it. The man

[01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:28.640]
is irrational. He was fumbling and carrying on and making guttural sounds on the air. I just couldn't

[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:33.960]
believe that. How do you know that was Gary? Oh, I'd recognize that. It's like that. There's a

[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:39.680]
certain like psychosis in the like Tony Perkins, you know, in psycho. There's a trembling in the voice.

[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:47.340]
Yeah. That's the word you absolutely. Okay. I stay. I rest my case. Okay. Let's see. He's got

[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:52.700]
a line one on there, but that's flashing. Dave, Dave, county. Hello. Howdy. Yes, sir. I can

[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:59.840]
solve the problem of your missing tape. Okay. On Saturday morning. Oh, no. Uh oh.

[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:04.000]
So was doing a comparison. Oh, and the.

[01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:09.580]
AJ, you know, I'm going to tell you something. This meat. We're going to take Peter Bulger and

[01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:15.360]
Stan major. We're going to lock them both in padded cell in straight jackets and then maybe.

[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:19.340]
I'm not saying that that's any guarantee, but maybe after about a week and get through a month

[01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:23.340]
and not have anything disappear out of this room. And he was cutting back and forth between the two

[01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:28.900]
cuts. I couldn't tell the difference. What a mung-briss made confirms our worst fears. In other

[01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:33.780]
words, why did he bring it up here and why did we play it if he was going to rip it off?

[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:38.860]
I thought it was a dub that was made for us. Didn't you think so? Yeah. Exactly. I mean,

[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:43.680]
I thought it was great. Yeah, it is great. But it's something the other part of the building now.

[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:49.900]
Oh, that's the answer to your mystery. Well, I appreciate it. What we thought. And just my worst

[01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:55.620]
fears have been confirmed. Right. That's right. Okay. Another major problem. Okay. Thanks a lot.

[01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:59.860]
You too. Yeah, it's going to be great after hearing about that.

[01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:10.760]
You want to bet just way to let next monthly comes down. Yes, you're on the sunshine.

[01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:17.460]
Be the darkest cloud in the history of the human race. Look like Hiroshima after they dropped the bomb.

[01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:20.580]
Look up in the sky. It's pretty dark. It looks like nighttime.

[01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:27.040]
Yeah, Arlene. That's it. I love it after nine. If you don't listen, if I give the time quite a bit,

[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:30.960]
maybe a little bit too much. But if you're one of those time intensive people who's too

[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:36.860]
cheap to buy a watch, even a Tony Prado's jewelry sale, no sweat. Because if you listen very

[01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:41.440]
closely, you'll hear Arlene in the all morning long with those very good, those piercing time checks

[01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:47.080]
in the background. Those are my favorites. Also the latest news and weather. Yeah. What's the new motto?

[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:52.800]
Deep down inside. You know what's happening. Oh, uh, something like that. Yeah. So blin,

[01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:57.220]
oh, so blin, blin. And that's on the Jeff Stryker show. That's coming up at noon today on Zeta 4.

[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:02.020]
Rowered County. Hello. Hello. How you doing? Okay. This is the second time of call.

[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:07.520]
A call last week. I'm a seven day listener. Really? And I was or a seventh day Adventist. Okay.

[01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:14.340]
I was with some friends this morning. And they heard you talk about the FM Mungbirds or

[01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:21.640]
yeah, Mungrains. Free, free, freebies. Yeah. Yeah. And they did. They were really pissed off. Why?

[01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:26.900]
Because what you were saying. Oh, they don't like the truth? Well, I guess that's what it is. You

[01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:30.860]
see? Because everybody was calling for those tickets. But I'm glad that you said that this morning

[01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:35.400]
because now I probably can get through more often because the lines won't be tied up. And then

[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:40.060]
after Thursday, the lines will never be tied up. After Thursday? Yeah. Well, that's when that

[01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:44.800]
show is Thursday. So it's Thursday. Oh, you mean after the YouTube? Oh, but there's always

[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:48.900]
something else. Don't you understand? Yeah, but not as big as that. Well, yeah, but like the police

[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:52.700]
are coming. In fact, the police are coming because Captain Dave called him the other day when we're

[01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:57.800]
talking about that specimen bottle. He called the police. Well, I don't want to be as crazy as that.

[01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:03.720]
No, that's for sure. Well, maybe we'll rain on them Thursday. Yeah. Serve serves them right.

[01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:08.920]
Yeah. Well, I was glad you said all that. You lost a couple listeners, but I'll hang in there.

[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:12.640]
What do you mean? Why? Because we're not giving anything away? Well, that's good. Hey, listen,

[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:17.560]
great. That's it. Let's weed those people out and let them go over to GTR and wherever else to

[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:23.740]
give it all is. Donald and Greg. Yeah, GTR, a woman. The one that sounds like she's talking through

[01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:30.460]
the toilet. Yeah, Panty Murray. Right. Yeah. No, she's talking from down inside with the tidy bullman.

[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:35.900]
Right. Well, that's the toilet. They have a lot in common those two. Okay, I forget I call

[01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:41.000]
in fact, she's got a mouth like a toilet and brains to match. Okay, listen, have a nice day.

[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:46.900]
Okay, we have an indignant little Eva fan in line. Two. Hello. Little Eva fan. Why are you

[01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:53.640]

[01:16:53.820 --> 01:16:58.800]
I do have said that she had done. What was the song you said? Don't say. Yeah, look emotion. And

[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:05.640]
she also said something that she had done also. Don't say nothing bad about my baby. Yeah,

[01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:15.720]
she did match potatoes. No, that was that was DD sharp. Oh my God. Oh, well, I guess you know,

[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:21.660]
it's just she may have made mashed potatoes. And she she may have eaten mashed potatoes. I'm sure

[01:17:21.660 --> 01:17:28.020]
sure. That's right. Yeah, but she never recorded it. Okay. Oh, it was DD sharp. She had something

[01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:34.720]
to do with choppy checker. Yeah, well, in the same era. Oh, God. Yeah. Okay, well, in fact,

[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:41.420]
the DD sharp also did the mashed potato time. You're right. Right? Yes. Yeah, she kind of looked,

[01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:47.480]
she looked the ill. She looked like Bobby Ridell with a dark complexion. She did. She had

[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:52.940]
a place in here. The dark compared complexion. I can tell you some interesting stories about Bobby

[01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:57.520]
Ridell, but it's not between midnight and six in the morning. So I'll say them. All right. Okay,

[01:17:57.820 --> 01:18:04.280]
you know the kind of stories I mean. Yes, I know. Bobby had what did he do? Tallahassee? No, that was

[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:09.040]
Freddie Cannon. Boom boom. Oh, my God. You're like you really, in other words, you got the right

[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:12.820]
general time period. But other than that, you're all screwed up. You know what I'm saying? Like

[01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:20.500]
Freddie Cannon did Palisades Park and Tallahassee Lassie completely screwed up. Yeah. And Bobby Ridell

[01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:30.340]
did Wild One. Be Wild? No, no, not be. Yeah. Yeah, born to be wild. Yeah, we will. Yes,

[01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:36.460]
Steppenwolf. Yes. Yeah, but you didn't know that Bobby Ridell became the lead singer in Steppenwolf,

[01:18:36.580 --> 01:18:45.060]
didn't you? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, for the first time called this is two shocking

[01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:50.140]
for me. And I heard that he was the rumor is sir that he was backed up by tab hunter.

[01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:52.440]
Tab hunter and

[01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:52.740]
uh

[01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:56.440]
Antivine. Yeah, now you're getting

[01:18:56.440 --> 01:19:02.180]
all right. Okay, now you got it. Have a nice day, sir. He finally got the message finally putting it together.

[01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:07.820]
Yeah, so to speak. Mm-hmm. It's 12 and it's past nine on say to four. What would have happened to a tab hunter?

[01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:13.200]
He they just released another movie. Yeah, he does movies with divine. They just released him. Oh,

[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:17.560]
he does movies with divine. Yeah, they released another one this past summer. Really? Yeah. Oh,

[01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:21.960]
boy, I bet you there's something there that meets the eye. Okay, where should we go now?

[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:25.920]
Tab hunter when he was young was a pretty interesting looking guy. I'll say that now when he opened his mouth,

[01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:32.280]
right that created a problem still basically the same. Yeah, kind of an airhead. Mm-hmm. But

[01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:37.040]
when he was younger and he always made those western movies where he ran around with almost no clothes on

[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:41.900]
during the entire movie. Yeah, that's it. Nice to sit when I was a little kid I used to sit very close to the screen.

[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:47.160]
Where are we going next to a Broward County? Hello. Hi, how you doing today? Real good.

[01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:52.560]
Good. I just called in to tell you I think you're doing an excellent job here on FM. You're absolutely

[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:57.060]
right, sir. And I'm glad you had a good time at the Fair on Saturday. Oh, it was great. I only

[01:19:57.060 --> 01:20:01.320]
wished that Zeta could have been there. Yeah, you know, I heard you're talking about that and I

[01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:05.800]
had seen you at the fair. I met you. My wife was sitting across from you on the pirate ride.

[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:13.560]
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, so I was going to mention that to you that you know, walking around the midway,

[01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:17.340]
there was there was nothing there for you guys. And I like like you said yesterday,

[01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:21.440]
everybody that shouldn't have been there was there and the guys that should be there weren't there.

[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:26.880]
That's right. Well, that's our chief our chief of Mangler in general manager. That's their brilliance,

[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:32.960]
you know. I'll tell you unbelievable. You can say that again. Well, now you understand why I

[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:36.820]
are slogan here at wins and Zeta's we hire the handicap. All you got to do is look in the management

[01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:44.580]
office and that's where we start. Well, I'm sure you know that better than myself. Trust me.

[01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:49.280]
These people I see some of the cars they drive. I would never lead you down to garden pants or trust me.

[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:53.940]
At least not too many times. Right. That's right. Well, that's good. How's everything else going today?

[01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:58.560]
Everything is great. We found out who stole our don't be cruel cut. Yeah. Yeah.

[01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:04.640]
We are FM program director was in here making all kinds of defensive excuses until he discovered

[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:10.320]
that he was dead wrong as usual and ran out of here. A twanging his suspenders. So, you know,

[01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:15.840]
I know that he wore those suspenders today. I guess that must have something to do with this

[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:19.800]
meeting. We're going to have it known because he had his suspenders on. They're going to hang them

[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:26.340]
up by his suspenders or hopefully. Yeah. Well, I'm happy that you got that that mystery solved that

[01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:33.200]
major mystery. Yeah, another major dilemma. Yeah, here at W here in Kerala city. You got it. Okay,

[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:38.800]
have a nice day. All right. You two take care now. Thanks a lot. You too. You too. You too. See,

[01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:43.920]
ordinarily, we would never notice that because that comes up in most calls ordinarily. Oh, yeah.

[01:21:44.140 --> 01:21:47.340]
But now that there's all this YouTube friends, you by the way, if you missed the early part of the show,

[01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:52.380]
we're not giving away a damn thing on this show anymore. Okay. We give away the unbelievable buttons.

[01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:57.580]
Now, did you get a lot of mail on that or just a smattering? Yeah. That's the word. The mail is just

[01:21:57.580 --> 01:22:01.740]
weak. I mean, what is it with you? People are you brain dead? I know there's a lot of people listening.

[01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:07.700]
Sure. No question about that. But it's a different kind of it's a totally passive. Give me, give me,

[01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:14.700]
give me good love and buy the crazy elephant. I remember that. Yeah. I couldn't. I just, it just

[01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:20.020]
came out. Yeah. Give me, give me good love and buy crazy. It was crazy elephant. Yeah. Do we have that?

[01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:24.220]
Let's cue that up right away. I've never seen that. No, you won't see that in there. It's too good.

[01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:29.560]
God just called me Mark on the phone. Where'd he get that? Mark in the dark. I thought you were Mark

[01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:37.100]
shans. He writes a Mark shans stationary. Does he really? Yes, he does. Are you talking about

[01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:43.700]
give me, give me good love and never again? The pop up pop up. Yeah. That's it. You got it. Crazy elephant.

[01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:49.820]
No, we're talking about a different one, but the one by Sonia Henny. What is he talking about?

[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:56.540]
Like, how many would there be with the same name? We're talking about psychotic reaction. That's

[01:22:56.540 --> 01:23:05.140]
coming up shortly on Zeta 4, very relatable. Jeff Beck on leave. Leave this 916 on Zeta 4. Let's go to

[01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:11.740]
date County. Hello. Hello. I know you're there. I'm positive. I would bet serious money on it.

[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:19.780]
Not my money. Now they're gone. Date County. Hello. Yes. I know the guy who replaced Peter

[01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:27.740]
and Chicago. Okay. He was Joe Williams and he's the son of Ted Williams, the conductor of the

[01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:33.820]
Boston pop. How about that? And Neil, I need to ask you a question that pop boom picture. Is this

[01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:40.940]
from a girlie magazine? Yeah, it's from Hustler. I do have that issue then. Let it's no big deal

[01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:48.040]
as I'm sure you saw. Yeah. It is shocking though, isn't it? Well, you know, they say about big feet.

[01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:54.620]
Yeah. Well, that's got about size three feet. So that explains a lot. I don't know why he turned

[01:23:54.620 --> 01:23:59.800]
to religion because if I were in his shoes, I'd be bitter at the Lord, you know. In fact, I already am.

[01:23:59.940 --> 01:24:04.320]
Okay. Listen, have a wonderful day and thanks for the update. Okay. How do I see YouTube? You too. Yeah,

[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:09.740]
YouTube. From that Chicago update. Now, maybe we ought to play Peter Satira. What is the thing with

[01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:16.660]
Peter Satira? I grant you he's wimpy. Yeah. I mean real wimpy. Two saccharine. No, it's not. It's

[01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:20.720]
sugary. No, it's not. I think great. Now, who the hell is that that just drove in? I think that's

[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:26.380]
what's his name? I looked like Gary. What is it? Gary Lawrence got five cars now? And who is it

[01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:31.000]
that drove in before? I don't know what that is. Gary. Oh, that is Gary. Okay. Scratch the nine o'clock,

[01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:37.720]
nine sixteen folks come straggling in here at nine sixteen. I think he has somebody who looks like

[01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:42.520]
him who comes in early. Yeah. Sort of like that. Very good point. He has a decoy that comes in about

[01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:47.840]
fifteen minutes to a half hour early because he knows we keep given the time on the year and then

[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:55.560]
he makes it look good. Now, this song you wanted to play by Chicago beginnings. Yeah, it might be

[01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:59.620]
a lot. I was going to say it might be a good idea to wait like about thirty minutes from now and play it.

[01:24:59.660 --> 01:25:05.600]
At the end of the show, what is it about eight minutes? Eight minutes. Oh, that's the unedited. That's

[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:09.620]
the whole thing. That's a great record. With the percussion at the end. Oh, it's phenomenal. Yeah.

[01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:16.400]
That's from their first album, isn't it? Chicago Transit Authority. No, no. It is a second album.

[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:22.220]
It's one of the early. It's a really. It's got it. It's Chicago. No, Chicago won. It's not

[01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:26.320]
see the Chicago Transit Authority. So the second second, that's what I just said. I thought only

[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:31.080]
moments ago. Yeah. Well, what about twenty five or six till four? Is that that was not on the same

[01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:37.060]
album? I think that was the one that was on CTA. That's Chicago to. What? That's Chicago to.

[01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:41.320]
Huh. Now, all right. Now, what about does anybody know what time it is?

[01:25:41.340 --> 01:25:44.040]
What is like Ron Harris and talking about registered a winning something? What?

[01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:49.880]
What about does anybody really know what time it is? It's about nine eight seven. Yeah. Come on.

[01:25:50.780 --> 01:25:56.520]
That's Chicago one Robert Lam. Bobby Lam. Yeah. He wrote it too. He wrote it. He sings it. He plays

[01:25:56.520 --> 01:26:03.580]
the piano and that was before Terry Cath's spilled his brains, right? What a way to put it.

[01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:10.180]
Well, is there a better way to put it about? How about Dwyer? Did he, uh, how would you describe that?

[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:15.600]
I mean, this isn't like the Howard Stern show where we play the audio tape of it over and over and

[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:19.320]
over. Oh, we don't have that. If we had it, we would. I used to have it. Did you really?

[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:25.220]
Oh, but don't do it. Bam, you know, you hear people screaming and moaning and whining and

[01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:30.140]
Howard was playing it over and over. Right. Must have played it like a hundred times.

[01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:35.340]
What he did was there was a woman in it who really screamed right before he did it, you know,

[01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:40.800]
like, ah, yeah, and he kept playing it like that. Like that. What you do with the dentist, which is open

[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:46.280]
say, ah, Howard. So Howard. So Howard, one of those tongue-to-tongue oppressors in. Yeah.

[01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:54.140]
He took that scream and he put it on a James Brown record. So we go, I feel good and you hear

[01:26:54.140 --> 01:27:00.640]
the woman go, ah, pretty morbid. That's what he did. That's what the controversy was about.

[01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:06.680]
He would last a long time here. 920 now and stated the Pebbleau, Colorado,

[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:12.660]
Chieftain has reinstated the comic strip Bloom County by popular demand, but they put it in the

[01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:18.740]
classified sections with the controversial Dunesbury comic strip. Now the Chieftain stopped running,

[01:27:19.380 --> 01:27:25.520]
the Pulitzer Prize winning Bloom County three weeks ago when in the comic strip it kept saying

[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:33.280]
Reagan sucks, but readers protested and radio stations in the area started reading the comic strip

[01:28:55.980 --> 01:29:02.040]
Gary Lawrence and Ricky take it together. Please. Is there a twin? And that should have pulled

[01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:07.840]
up before Gary actually came in. Never thought about that very very strong possibility. Yeah.

[01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:29.580]
Okay, what? Oh, that's right. The boy. Yeah, Sam. Yeah, from Blue Velvet. See, some people are

a few minutes and you say, what the hell is this? Because you have to stick with it. I can't stick with it.

place in there to keep it every day. And then the next day you can come in and the. You retrieve it.

[01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:51.920]
I know I'm not retrieving anything. Do I look like a retriever? I'm not doing any of that stuff.

[01:30:52.220 --> 01:30:56.580]
But that's a way because at 10 o'clock from now on, this room is locked. Well, you mean we have to pay

[01:30:56.580 --> 01:31:00.860]
for Stan's greedy little thing. Exactly. That's it. Or, essentially, because the whole.

[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.980]
The leader of older sticky little figures that took the book out of here too.

[01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:11.120]
Do you use that book? Not often. No. Rarely. In other words, once in a blue moon. Hear the Marcel's on Zeta 4.

[01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:16.320]
I'm about that. Yeah. And nobody else uses that book. But Peter is like insisted, you know,

[01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:20.660]
by Scott, like he's pretending to be organized. The man is the most disorganized PD. I've ever seen

[01:31:20.660 --> 01:31:25.240]
him in my life. And he's pretending that he's organized. Now, what's this meaning about today?

[01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:30.740]
I think it's about the U2 show on Thursday. Yeah. I know it's not. It isn't. Well, it is. Yeah,

[01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:35.080]
to set up about the logistics of broadcasting from the orange. Well, why do we have to go?

[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:40.620]
What the hell has that got to do with me? Nothing is the correct answer. I'm going to tell you one

[01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:45.120]
thing. If that's what it is. And I come back here for that meeting tomorrow show.

[01:31:46.120 --> 01:31:50.160]
You remember what President Roosevelt said? He said that this is a day that will live in infinity.

[01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:55.680]
Tomorrow show you will everybody will want to tape and save for their grandchildren, okay?

[01:31:55.940 --> 01:31:59.960]
Well, were you personally informed that you had to come to the exactly. And I was informed that Gary

[01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:03.980]
Lawrence was going to be there. And Peter Moon was spreading rumors this morning. And of course,

[01:32:03.980 --> 01:32:07.160]
anybody should know it's him because he's here at these important hours of the morning.

[01:32:07.940 --> 01:32:13.600]
He's spreading rumors that the show is what do you say? It's about corporate stuff is in station stuff.

[01:32:14.260 --> 01:32:15.740]
Corporate stuff. Are you going Jeff?

[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:20.380]
He's going to be here. What are you talking about? Now, who does your show while let me know?

[01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:25.020]
That's the question. Transcribed. Oh, it's a. The retainer puts on an 80 minute cut.

[01:32:25.300 --> 01:32:30.860]
Now I take my little breaks and make believe that it's long. Okay. Do you hear that, ladies and gentlemen?

[01:32:30.860 --> 01:32:36.360]
Gonser will not be in there in the noon hour. And Sherry Valancy will be running the tape.

[01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:41.180]
She is. Yeah. Well, that's good. While she's in there, maybe she can write some copy too.

[01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:45.620]
You think so? That would be good. Hey, Waxi used to do whole weekends of programming this.

[01:32:45.820 --> 01:32:49.020]
I know. They still do. By the way, don't miss the big sale.

[01:32:49.020 --> 01:32:52.960]
Hey, did you get the your memo yet? Do you have to be a jewelryish?

[01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:58.720]
You have to be Jewish to cash in on that. The better effect. You can get those combination Jewish

[01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:03.780]
stars and cross. See, now I know what Tony Prego does all day while she's not making her spaghetti sauce.

[01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:09.240]
She's no selling hot stuff all over the building. That's how she makes it. Yeah, a little

[01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:13.520]
rake off because she's sure not doing anything with promotion. That's for damn sure. Okay.

[01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:19.420]
26 past nine on Zeta for. Yeah, get him out now. Trust me.

[01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:22.040]
And a clock man. No chance.

[01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:30.400]
Broward County. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah, I wanted to ask you a favor. Okay.

[01:33:31.100 --> 01:33:36.100]
Yesterday I heard this. The song you played about the wheel of fortune. Yeah.

[01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:40.700]
And then we're talking Spanish and stuff. Yeah. I want to ask you if you could play that today.

[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:45.420]
Vanna picked me a letter. Yeah, that's it. I'll tell you what. By the time. Where is your radio right now?

[01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:52.780]
Oh, right beside me. Okay. By the time you hang up in just a second here and turn your radio back up,

[01:33:52.780 --> 01:33:57.660]
it'll already be playing. How's that for service? Excellent. Okay. Have a great day. I really love your show.

[01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:06.840]
Boy boy. They got to push the you got to push the start button. I did. Now you push the stop button.

[01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:10.780]
I've never done that before. How about it? No. Why the hell did I do that? Well, it doesn't matter.

[01:34:10.780 --> 01:34:14.300]
Is there something Freudian about that? I pushed the stop button.

[01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:19.060]
Probably the pressure that's building here. Just move along because I want to tell you if that

[01:34:19.060 --> 01:34:22.940]
meeting is really about the you two thing on Thursday. That's frightening what he says.

[01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:28.520]
The spit is going to hit the fan. Trust me. You can go to the bank on it.

[01:34:40.780 --> 01:34:44.540]
Thanks. What do you mean? Bank right on. How much money I got to spend?

[01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:50.080]
Content to look at that. Say Jack again won't throw in the towers.

[01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:55.920]
Still like by your powers. Oh, Vanna. Pick me a letter. Hey, man. What do you mean? There's no

[01:34:55.920 --> 01:35:02.000]
F and F? Vanna picked me a letter. No one does it any better. I dream about you. Hey,

[01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:06.600]
Vanna. Is that an all over? Tanner? What? Vanna, I don't understand why you make a

[01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:13.020]
hundred grand. Not for me to say. Anyway, get me a ticket for an error plane.

[01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:20.340]
Gonna be on the Wheel of Fortune game. I just got to win. Spend the Wheel again.

[01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:25.500]
Oh, Vanna. Pick me a letter. Go, Vanna. Go, baby. Go, alright.

[01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:31.160]
Hey, get out of my face, Pat. Is that a two wing? Is there an L in that word?

[01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:33.400]
Is there L? All right.

[01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:37.960]
Forget the letter, man. I'll take Vanna. Why are you beautiful, baby?

[01:35:38.180 --> 01:35:41.620]
You and me could play the home game. Got me a ticket for an error plane.

[01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:48.380]
All right. I'm on the Wheel of Fortune game. I just love that sound. I'm in the bonus

[01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:54.040]
rounds. Hey, Vanna. Pick me a letter. Lose a turn. Hey, Pat. Lose it.

[01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:59.080]
Vanna picked me a letter. No one does it any better. I dream about you.

[01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:02.960]
All right. That isn't all over, man. Vanna, I don't mean to stare,

[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:10.560]
but are you wearing underwear? Not for me to say. Anyway, I don't care how much money I got to spend.

[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:16.100]
Can't stand to look. Get Pat's a jack again. Won't throw in the towel.

[01:36:16.420 --> 01:36:23.460]
Till I buy your vowels. Oh, Vanna. Pick me a letter. Please, Vanna. Pick me a letter.

[01:36:23.460 --> 01:36:26.240]
All right. I'm ready to pick, baby.

[01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:31.500]
APCDEFGHJJK. LMOPQICWXYZ. That's your cover, man.

[01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:36.040]
All right. I'll take the sofa, the blender, the microwave, the refrigerator.

[01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:40.860]
Hey, man. Pat, what do you mean? $500,000, for a black and white five-inch portable TV set.

[01:36:41.260 --> 01:36:44.620]
You got ripped off, man. My brother and I can get it for your whole sale.

[01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:49.040]
Give me the money and I'll buy the TV set, man. All right. Hey, Vanna, come on, baby.

[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:55.960]
Neil wakes me up in the morning.

[01:36:56.060 --> 01:36:57.000]
In the morning.

[01:36:57.440 --> 01:36:59.300]
Neil wakes me up with a smile.

[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:00.760]
With a smile, yeah.

[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:03.920]
Drinking my coffee, bunching on my donut.

[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:06.300]
Whips in the fur of the dial.

[01:37:07.340 --> 01:37:13.560]
Get patty because you're slow with me. Whips in the fur of the dial.

[01:37:14.740 --> 01:37:18.200]
Tired of you working my rules with a dialy nail.

[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:21.540]
Whips in the fur on my dial. Oh, rid of.

[01:37:21.540 --> 01:37:24.040]
Neil Neil Neil, I am sweety.

[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.440]
Neil Neil Neil, Neil Neil, Neil Neil.

[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:38.180]
Neil Neil Neil, I will say this. You did an excellent job.

[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:42.300]
I was really good. I just surprised myself on this one.

[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:44.260]
Why don't you carry it away?

[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:45.860]
No, he did.

[01:37:45.980 --> 01:37:48.680]
He really did the magnificent job of redoing it.

[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:49.600]
It's better, isn't it?

[01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:50.100]
It sounds like that.

[01:37:50.260 --> 01:37:51.780]
I thought that they had redone the jingle.

[01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:56.380]
Which there's no way in the world this outfit would pay for that.

[01:37:56.440 --> 01:37:58.380]
Can you believe he liked this captain Dave?

[01:37:58.820 --> 01:37:59.660]
Well, he didn't say that.

[01:37:59.660 --> 01:38:00.860]
I didn't say I liked it at all.

[01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:02.800]
I said he did a good job of redoing it.

[01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:03.440]
I said it did it again.

[01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:04.660]
So I'm putting it together.

[01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:06.160]
It is pretty smooth.

[01:38:06.300 --> 01:38:07.100]
I must say myself.

[01:38:08.980 --> 01:38:13.620]
Well, those are the same people singing on that that did this that Pete gave me yesterday.

[01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:14.900]
Memories.

[01:38:16.220 --> 01:38:18.320]
He wakes me up in the morning.

[01:38:18.580 --> 01:38:18.880]
Okay.

[01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:23.760]
All right, let's go to Broward County and get back with just loads of these great calls

[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:24.540]
from all these people.

[01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:27.720]
And the thing I like about the callers today, they know they're getting nothing.

[01:38:28.420 --> 01:38:28.640]
Okay.

[01:38:29.140 --> 01:38:30.800]
Those are the kind of listeners we want.

[01:38:30.980 --> 01:38:33.180]
Not these FM free loaders.

[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:34.300]
Broward County.

[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:34.600]
Hello.

[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:35.540]
Hello, Neil.

[01:38:35.900 --> 01:38:36.300]
Yes, sir.

[01:38:36.420 --> 01:38:39.120]
That's not just this close to being completely psychotic.

[01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:40.520]
Oh, really?

[01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:41.020]
Yes.

[01:38:41.100 --> 01:38:42.900]
Do you have one of those impossible dreams, sir?

[01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:43.440]
Yes.

[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:45.880]
I heard you were the greatest talk show in the country.

[01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:46.620]
That's right.

[01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:49.480]
Well, anyway, when it happened, I took my kitty.

[01:38:50.220 --> 01:38:52.560]
That's in the plastic, $5,000.

[01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:55.000]
And you'll never dream in a million years to it.

[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:55.400]
It looked like.

[01:38:55.780 --> 01:38:57.380]
You sound like the guy on the screen.

[01:38:57.380 --> 01:38:58.100]
He sure does, Jim.

[01:38:59.080 --> 01:38:59.480]
Who is that?

[01:38:59.660 --> 01:39:00.260]
That's the man, Major.

[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:02.500]
So sweet.

[01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:04.820]
It was so horrible.

[01:39:04.980 --> 01:39:06.160]
My cat just popped.

[01:39:07.180 --> 01:39:08.480]
It was so bad.

[01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:10.400]
It was horrible.

[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:10.960]

[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:10.960]

[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:10.960]

[01:39:11.540 --> 01:39:12.020]
Oh.

[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:12.720]
Yeah.

[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:15.380]
Well, it sounds like you've had an emotional experience over it.

[01:39:15.380 --> 01:39:15.840]
Haven't you?

[01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:16.780]
That's fairly new.

[01:39:17.220 --> 01:39:19.740]
You know who was on MTV this weekend besides Howard Stern?

[01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:20.420]
Who's that?

[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:21.020]
Divine.

[01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:22.620]
Yeah, I heard about that.

[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:23.600]
I didn't see it.

[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:23.900]
I missed it.

[01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:24.660]
You know what you looked like?

[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:26.120]
Yeah.

[01:39:26.540 --> 01:39:27.180]
Yeah, he's seen.

[01:39:27.340 --> 01:39:28.660]
I've seen him on David Letterman.

[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:29.240]
Oh, really?

[01:39:29.420 --> 01:39:30.060]
He's enormous.

[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:33.520]
Yeah, I was going to say if he didn't know, he's going to use it good analogy, but

[01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:34.400]
he might have been offended.

[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:35.520]
Oh, OK.

[01:39:35.620 --> 01:39:36.300]
Well, go ahead.

[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:37.140]
I can handle it.

[01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:37.600]
Are you sure?

[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:39.340]
I was going to say you looked like you and drag.

[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:41.960]
Oh, he's a lot bigger than I am.

[01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:43.020]
Yeah, that's true.

[01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:43.700]
A lot.

[01:39:43.980 --> 01:39:45.040]
Well, he doesn't know Roger.

[01:39:45.340 --> 01:39:45.500]
Yeah.

[01:39:45.620 --> 01:39:48.600]
Well, in fact, one day this week I'm coming in and drag just for the hell of it.

[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:50.360]
OK.

[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:52.040]
Are you going to do the YouTube concert?

[01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:53.360]
You just like totally hate them.

[01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:55.100]
No, I don't hate them at all.

[01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:57.020]
In fact, you know, it's really amazing to me.

[01:39:57.180 --> 01:40:00.920]
I brought in, this is before anybody was even talking about the concert.

[01:40:01.100 --> 01:40:06.500]
Weeks ago, I brought in my very own Joshua Tree CD that I had bought from the Columbia

[01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:07.440]
CD Club.

[01:40:07.780 --> 01:40:08.580]
Give it away at the children.

[01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:10.880]
And I gave it away on the air, right?

[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:11.320]
Remember that?

[01:40:11.540 --> 01:40:13.080]
That was back on AM.

[01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:15.320]
That's many moons ago, OK?

[01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:17.020]
Before anybody even knew they were coming here.

[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:20.580]
And now, why would I buy that if I didn't like YouTube?

[01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:21.420]
I need to know.

[01:40:21.420 --> 01:40:22.380]
He thought Bona was disgusting.

[01:40:22.700 --> 01:40:25.580]
Well, he is disgusting, but I like the music.

[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:26.640]
Yeah, they're OK.

[01:40:27.420 --> 01:40:28.080]
You got it?

[01:40:28.460 --> 01:40:28.720]
Yeah.

[01:40:29.020 --> 01:40:30.300]
OK, you're going to the concert, right?

[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:30.980]
Yeah.

[01:40:31.260 --> 01:40:32.240]
OK, I hope you enjoy it.

[01:40:32.260 --> 01:40:32.740]
Have a good life.

[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:33.280]
You too.

[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:34.600]
You too.

[01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:35.560]
You too.

[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:39.620]
Well, Elvis Jr. is back from another pressing engagement.

[01:40:39.620 --> 01:40:40.740]
There he is.

[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:42.260]
Are you going to the Me Too concerto?

[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:44.260]
No, I'm not going to Me Too or You Too, Elvis.

[01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:46.320]
I'm going to the O2.

[01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:47.140]
Is that right?

[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:49.300]
So how does the spot come out?

[01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:51.660]
A slice of pizza.

[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:51.820]
I guess.

[01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:53.360]
A slice of pizza.

[01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:54.560]
Come on, Elvis Jr.

[01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:55.580]
I don't think I can match.

[01:40:56.140 --> 01:40:56.380]
No.

[01:40:56.700 --> 01:40:57.340]
Well, nobody can.

[01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:00.660]
Well, did you hear the story about what happened to our cart?

[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:03.680]
Oh, we got to call about it.

[01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:04.460]
We don't know what to do with a certain individual.

[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:05.500]
It certainly might.

[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:05.760]

[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:06.140]
On the other.

[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:06.720]
Yeah.

[01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:08.720]
Somebody playing it Saturday.

[01:41:08.980 --> 01:41:09.220]
Yeah.

[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:09.540]
Was he really?

[01:41:09.700 --> 01:41:13.880]
It was playing it back and forth with the original and doing this big comparison thing.

[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:18.960]
And of course, as usual, I didn't bother to bring it back to where it was nesting

[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:22.680]
originally, which means he probably took it out of here Saturday.

[01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:23.220]
Yeah.

[01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:24.080]
Wouldn't you say?

[01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:24.820]
Well, yeah.

[01:41:25.140 --> 01:41:28.180]
And Peter Boulder keeps insisting, oh, there's nobody in that room.

[01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:28.820]
It's locked.

[01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:32.260]
I guess Stan pays a lot of money for those locksmiths, huh?

[01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:33.320]
He really does.

[01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:34.720]
He would do that too.

[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:36.200]
You're joking, but he would do it.

[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:36.960]
He's desperate enough.

[01:41:37.300 --> 01:41:37.700]
Yeah.

[01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:42.720]
When you're as dry of material as he is, when the well has run dry, man, you'll be able to

[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:45.300]
sit around this studio about 130 in the afternoon, man.

[01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:45.540]
Yeah.

[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:46.260]
That's a thought.

[01:41:46.580 --> 01:41:50.120]
No, he could just like, he could hide in the A-track room there and he could just like

[01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:51.800]
peer over the top of the window.

[01:41:52.460 --> 01:41:57.540]
And as he sees somebody skulking down the hall and wandering in here and rifling through these

[01:41:57.540 --> 01:41:58.960]
carts, can there be any question?

[01:41:59.520 --> 01:41:59.760]
Okay.

[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:02.200]
So I guess what we'll do is we'll do, it's Niggler never.

[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:05.140]
Because we got to do something in honor of his being here, right?

[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:05.880]
And this is great.

[01:42:06.180 --> 01:42:06.460]
Okay.

[01:42:06.660 --> 01:42:07.940]
Not as good as Don't Be Cruel, though.

[01:42:08.100 --> 01:42:13.220]
I don't think I did it that well because, uh, well, I wrote that copy right before I went

[01:42:13.220 --> 01:42:16.800]
on stage that night and I used one of my dad's songs.

[01:42:16.980 --> 01:42:19.180]
I was quite ready for it.

[01:42:19.180 --> 01:42:20.540]
In other words, he's rolling in his grave.

[01:42:20.540 --> 01:42:21.280]
Is that what you're saying?

[01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:23.380]
I believe he's always going to rock and roll.

[01:42:23.700 --> 01:42:25.800]
He's rocking and rolling in his grave.

[01:42:26.140 --> 01:42:28.900]
In fact, we might even play Graceland too, my Paul Simon.

[01:42:28.900 --> 01:42:30.120]
We can really get unlikely.

[01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:30.900]
We can get carried away.

[01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:00.420]
Oh, for me.

[01:43:02.220 --> 01:43:07.440]
I'm not the first person here with his witty sob.

[01:43:08.900 --> 01:43:15.080]
If you're so weak, but always excited.

[01:43:16.780 --> 01:43:21.840]
Now I always hear him, but won't get to me again.

[01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:28.900]
Paul knows when he'll look at my rear end that way.

[01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:32.140]
It's a new early morning.

[01:43:33.580 --> 01:43:35.620]
He's up for the night.

[01:43:37.380 --> 01:43:43.060]
He's got to the federal room and it seems such a pride.

[01:43:44.660 --> 01:43:49.840]
The morning will never be the same.

[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:17.200]
Paul knows when he'll come.

[01:44:17.220 --> 01:44:18.260]
He's getting my third

[01:44:18.260 --> 01:44:21.520]
Oh, here I am.

[01:44:25.820 --> 01:44:28.680]
Oh, here I am.

[01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:31.620]
Oh, here I am.

[01:44:32.980 --> 01:44:35.960]
Oh, here I am.

[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:45.240]
Oh, here I am.

[01:44:45.780 --> 01:44:47.180]
I can't hold it that long, there was.

[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:47.720]
I'll bet.

[01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:48.860]
Maybe you can hold it for me.

[01:44:48.860 --> 01:44:49.440]
Yeah, hold this.

[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:50.820]
Okay, there he is.

[01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:51.440]
Elvis Jr.

[01:44:51.980 --> 01:44:52.860]
And it's Neil or never.

[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:53.440]
That's great.

[01:44:53.620 --> 01:44:54.140]
It really is.

[01:44:54.220 --> 01:44:56.100]
I mean, you don't, you're very modest about that.

[01:44:56.280 --> 01:44:57.100]
But, uh...

[01:44:57.100 --> 01:45:01.440]
Well, I got to tell you the night that I was there, the band, uh...

[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:02.780]
It's like they, they weren't there.

[01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:04.860]
Have you ever been to one of these J-Mikols get together?

[01:45:04.860 --> 01:45:05.860]
No, no, no.

[01:45:06.020 --> 01:45:06.520]
I'll pass.

[01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:07.740]
I can't handle the excitement.

[01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:09.400]
Too much pressure for me.

[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:13.240]
I turned around to like give him a signal of one night, you know, I, though, I wanted the

[01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:17.060]
song to stop and they just didn't follow along with me like my daddy's band used to do.

[01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:17.400]
Yeah.

[01:45:19.460 --> 01:45:20.960]
It's almost like they weren't there, you know.

[01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:21.780]
I like they were lost.

[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:22.760]
It's kind of like they were lost.

[01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:24.560]
Well, they were following Jay's lead, I guess.

[01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:25.080]

[01:45:26.020 --> 01:45:26.720]
You have her.

[01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:26.760]

[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:26.880]
You have her.

[01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:27.200]
You have her.

[01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:28.760]
You have her.

[01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:28.760]

[01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:29.320]
Yeah.

[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:35.660]
In fact, that's going to be the new name for your show, The Land of the Lost.

[01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:37.200]
He's a good guy.

[01:45:37.460 --> 01:45:37.800]
I guess.

[01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:38.980]
A terrible show, but a good guy.

[01:45:39.060 --> 01:45:39.960]
He's the party animal.

[01:45:40.120 --> 01:45:41.000]
Yes, he is.

[01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:44.620]
So, EJ, how do you like these Noiman mics over here on the FM?

[01:45:44.900 --> 01:45:45.540]
Well, these are fantastic.

[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:46.360]
You like these?

[01:45:46.580 --> 01:45:46.780]
Yeah.

[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.200]
I've worked with these before and studios before.

[01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:49.780]
Aren't they good?

[01:45:49.940 --> 01:45:50.660]
Yes, I agree.

[01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:51.420]
They're fantastic.

[01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:52.600]
Your favorite.

[01:45:53.340 --> 01:45:54.080]
Oh, I don't know.

[01:45:54.180 --> 01:45:56.240]
Yeah, I would, I would imagine they're my favorite.

[01:45:56.560 --> 01:46:00.720]
Well, let's just like pretend we play Don't Be Cruel because it was so good.

[01:46:00.820 --> 01:46:02.060]
I'm going to fix him so bad.

[01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:02.740]
You have no idea.

[01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:03.900]
I'm going to fix him.

[01:46:04.300 --> 01:46:08.640]
He gave me the key to his apartment because he said like if something ever happens to him,

[01:46:08.820 --> 01:46:12.280]
you know him, Mr. Paranoia, somebody should have the key.

[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:14.600]
And one day when he's on the year, I'm going to go up in there.

[01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:20.440]
I'm going to take like every tape and every cassette and every videotape that the man has got the mean.

[01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:22.460]
Not that tinker tinker soldier day.

[01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:22.680]
Oh, yeah.

[01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:23.700]
Oh, that old thing.

[01:46:23.700 --> 01:46:24.440]
I can take that.

[01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:24.920]
I hate that.

[01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:25.560]
I'm going to take that.

[01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:25.560]

[01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:25.560]

[01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:26.140]
What is that?

[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:28.920]
I mean, hours I spent dubbing that thing for him.

[01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:31.120]
That's like some stupid PBS BBC.

[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:35.000]
Didn't he watch like 18 episodes and missed the last one?

[01:46:35.060 --> 01:46:41.500]
He taped them and it's like 18 hour episodes and the last 20 minutes was missing.

[01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:42.580]
Betty told the story.

[01:46:42.860 --> 01:46:43.800]
He's a grown man to be watching.

[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:44.800]
I bet he will, you know.

[01:46:45.300 --> 01:46:48.780]
And Betty comes to town four years later and he comes up to all excited.

[01:46:48.780 --> 01:46:50.740]
And he goes, guess what I got, Betty?

[01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:52.720]
The last 20 minutes.

[01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:53.740]
I don't want to touch them.

[01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:54.920]
I bet that's what he said.

[01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:55.560]
He did.

[01:46:55.880 --> 01:46:56.580]
And you know what?

[01:46:56.640 --> 01:46:57.840]
It turned out she wasn't interested.

[01:46:59.060 --> 01:47:02.620]
At the end of the week, all I talk and not in the least bit interested.

[01:47:03.380 --> 01:47:04.820]
But I can't say that I blame her.

[01:47:04.900 --> 01:47:06.620]
Okay, 24 or 10 on J4.

[01:47:06.820 --> 01:47:10.200]
Let's take a couple of calls and then we're going to play a long record and go home and.

[01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:13.760]
If I don't think we'll even do the last news cast, do you?

[01:47:13.780 --> 01:47:14.020]
I don't.

[01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:14.960]
No, I don't.

[01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:17.760]
Stan tells me that you leave like at nine of 57.

[01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:20.400]
You're out of the building and it's going to be earlier than that.

[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:21.940]
Is that your limo right outside?

[01:47:21.940 --> 01:47:22.680]
And you know what else?

[01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:24.460]
We only work five days on this show.

[01:47:24.580 --> 01:47:25.360]
We don't work on Saturday.

[01:47:25.460 --> 01:47:27.900]
You know, he mentions that a lot every once in a while.

[01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:28.120]

[01:47:28.700 --> 01:47:31.640]
And like on Friday at 9.55.

[01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:35.780]
See, we got all the rest of the day off Friday, all day Saturday.

[01:47:36.060 --> 01:47:36.620]
That's a tough one.

[01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:37.520]
And all day Sunday.

[01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:40.700]
So it's almost like a three hour, a three day weekend.

[01:47:40.860 --> 01:47:43.440]
You know, you live a life much like my daddy used to have.

[01:47:43.580 --> 01:47:43.740]
Yeah.

[01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:45.780]
Yeah, I do spend a lot of time in the job.

[01:47:47.860 --> 01:47:51.900]
When you work for this company, man, you never, you never go too far.

[01:47:51.900 --> 01:47:52.920]
From the nearest job.

[01:47:53.820 --> 01:47:55.620]
Just don't bring in your reading material in there.

[01:47:55.620 --> 01:47:56.080]
Yeah, I know.

[01:47:56.260 --> 01:47:56.560]
I know.

[01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:58.040]
I try to avoid it.

[01:47:58.100 --> 01:47:59.840]
And I remember that I learned my lesson well.

[01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:05.000]
Okay, well, we don't take the call from if we're going to split early,

[01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:06.540]
we got to do the spots now.

[01:48:07.780 --> 01:48:08.180]
Hmm.

[01:48:08.820 --> 01:48:10.680]
Yeah, you know, is there any special?

[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:12.240]
Now, you see the problem.

[01:48:12.340 --> 01:48:17.400]
The problem with that is you're assuming that the break has to be at 40 is at it.

[01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:20.080]
Because we have 19 minutes to go.

[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:23.100]
Now, eight and three, my arithmetic could be a little bit off.

[01:48:23.460 --> 01:48:25.280]
That sounds like 11 minutes to me.

[01:48:25.580 --> 01:48:25.600]
Okay.

[01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:28.740]
In other words, you're saying in other words, let me just ask you this question.

[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:31.260]
Do I have trouble getting out of here at 10 o'clock?

[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:35.340]
Are we usually within 30 seconds a minute, one way or the other?

[01:48:36.060 --> 01:48:36.940]
At the other show.

[01:48:37.100 --> 01:48:37.620]
Am I correct?

[01:48:37.780 --> 01:48:41.460]
I was under the assumption that we either had to take it around 35 or 50.

[01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:43.420]
Oh, in other words, is that the law?

[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:45.280]
In addition to the eight minutes.

[01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:47.700]
In other words, you don't want us to get chewed out at the meeting today.

[01:48:47.700 --> 01:48:49.900]
If we don't take the break, it won't go as a proof time.

[01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:50.960]
I don't know.

[01:48:51.220 --> 01:48:52.500]
What do you mean you're not going to be there?

[01:48:52.540 --> 01:48:53.740]
I told you, I've got to do this.

[01:48:53.860 --> 01:48:56.160]
This is an important meeting about the YouTube concert.

[01:48:56.240 --> 01:48:58.720]
I had to pull out this of something really good.

[01:48:58.720 --> 01:48:59.440]
Wait a minute.

[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:00.180]
Hold up.

[01:49:00.260 --> 01:49:01.200]
You have to pull out.

[01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:03.980]
Don't you know there's a penalty for early withdrawal?

[01:49:08.700 --> 01:49:10.460]
What is this man talking about?

[01:49:10.460 --> 01:49:10.840]
I don't know.

[01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:11.960]
I'm really going to pull out.

[01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:14.860]
I don't want to know.

[01:49:14.860 --> 01:49:19.040]
Okay, now we did come on at a minute to six this morning and you used some vulgar language,

[01:49:19.540 --> 01:49:21.620]
which is totally unrelated to my show.

[01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:23.140]
It was before the idea.

[01:49:23.340 --> 01:49:24.780]
I hope it was talking about the Christmas tree.

[01:49:24.780 --> 01:49:26.620]
Whatever the hell it was, it had nothing to do with this show.

[01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:28.580]
It was still part of the Peter Moonshow.

[01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:30.820]
It was part of the midnight to six block.

[01:49:31.060 --> 01:49:31.300]
You bet.

[01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:33.980]
Maybe he should try the rhythm method.

[01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:35.420]
Yeah, I think that might help.

[01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:39.000]
So you're going to get out 11 minutes before the top of the hour.

[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.800]
Because we'll have three spots and then an eight minutes.

[01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:43.180]
No, no, what we'll do is we'll do the spots now.

[01:49:43.900 --> 01:49:48.580]
Like I was which I know is shocking because it actually covers like parts of two quarter hours,

[01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:51.460]
which the consultants will not they will not be able to handle that.

[01:49:51.460 --> 01:49:53.460]
Okay, you know, the understand what I'm saying.

[01:49:53.540 --> 01:49:55.960]
In other words, we might lose credit for both quarter hours.

[01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:58.620]
Now there's no logic in that because nobody's going anywhere, right?

[01:49:58.940 --> 01:49:59.820]
The phones are solid.

[01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:03.020]
Everything's been great, but we're taking the break at the wrong time.

[01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:03.540]
That's right.

[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.940]
So we'll probably get chastised for that by Peter Bulger.

[01:50:06.940 --> 01:50:10.640]
Notice he's got his suspenders on today because we have this big meeting.

[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:13.580]
Many days during the week lately, I've noticed no suspenders,

[01:50:13.580 --> 01:50:16.760]
but during the days when we have meetings, suspenders.

[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:18.500]
Well, he's got to have something to hold on to, right?

[01:50:18.660 --> 01:50:20.040]
Yeah. Well, that's about all he's got.

[01:50:20.900 --> 01:50:22.720]
That's the popular rumor and plantation.

[01:50:22.740 --> 01:50:23.500]
I'll tell you that.

[01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:24.980]
Okay, let's take the break.

[01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:25.720]
You know, we come back.

[01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:27.060]
We can chat with Elvis Jr.

[01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:29.940]
We can take a caller to and then without any pressure,

[01:50:30.180 --> 01:50:32.300]
any of your hysteria, then we can do it.

[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:33.280]
Hey, this is Dave.

[01:50:34.260 --> 01:50:36.460]
Okay, here we go.

[01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:38.540]
And not only do we have Elvis Jr.,

[01:50:38.540 --> 01:50:41.200]
we have a surprise celebrity standing by.

[01:50:41.380 --> 01:50:41.580]
Hello.

[01:50:41.940 --> 01:50:42.440]
Hey, pal.

[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:43.340]
How you doing, pal?

[01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:44.220]
All right.

[01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:45.060]
No changes.

[01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:50.320]
Listen, is my pal E.J. there?

[01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:51.120]
What's up, buddy?

[01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:52.880]
Hey, pal.

[01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:55.040]
How are you?

[01:50:55.040 --> 01:50:56.280]
You're up pretty early this morning, buddy.

[01:50:56.600 --> 01:50:58.540]
I am, man. I'm hurtin'.

[01:50:59.140 --> 01:51:01.280]
Are you calling from the Ferrari?

[01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:02.800]
No, man. I'm at home.

[01:51:03.220 --> 01:51:04.200]
I'm walkin' phone, you know.

[01:51:04.460 --> 01:51:06.040]
I'll listen to you on the balcony.

[01:51:06.420 --> 01:51:07.420]
Oh, are you locked out?

[01:51:07.420 --> 01:51:11.540]
No, man. I'm just diggin' the cool air, you know what I mean?

[01:51:11.720 --> 01:51:12.240]
Is that right?

[01:51:12.420 --> 01:51:13.680]
Yeah. Hey, listen, man.

[01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:14.940]
I got a question for Glenn.

[01:51:15.220 --> 01:51:15.820]
Yes, sir.

[01:51:16.540 --> 01:51:19.500]
You have a picture of more beautiful guys.

[01:51:19.580 --> 01:51:20.840]
Oh, my gosh.

[01:51:21.080 --> 01:51:22.980]
You know, that was Sinon, Don Jr.

[01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:24.640]
That was Sinon by a listener.

[01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:25.560]
Isn't that interesting?

[01:51:26.040 --> 01:51:27.780]
Hey, man. I got an overnumber.

[01:51:28.060 --> 01:51:28.540]
Do you, Ruth?

[01:51:28.600 --> 01:51:30.220]
I know she's up to no good, man.

[01:51:31.220 --> 01:51:31.860]
Is that anonymous?

[01:51:32.860 --> 01:51:33.680]
Was that anonymous?

[01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:35.780]
Yeah, was Sinon anonymously, Don Jr.

[01:51:35.780 --> 01:51:36.160]
What does he mean?

[01:51:36.460 --> 01:51:37.880]
He knows she's up to no good.

[01:51:38.060 --> 01:51:39.880]
And he wants to be in on that. Is that what you're sayin'?

[01:51:39.880 --> 01:51:40.440]
That's it, Don.

[01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:40.880]
I'm gonna say.

[01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:41.460]
I understand.

[01:51:41.700 --> 01:51:45.160]
You got this thing for young blondes, it sounds like.

[01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:47.620]
I got a thing for anything, you're lookin' like that.

[01:51:47.920 --> 01:51:50.180]
In other words, he wants to say, oh, God, that's no good.

[01:51:50.360 --> 01:51:51.680]
Is that what you're tryin' to say, Don?

[01:51:52.180 --> 01:51:53.580]
Hey, Jay, I heard that, too, man.

[01:51:53.620 --> 01:51:54.220]
That sounds really good.

[01:51:54.680 --> 01:51:55.740]
Well, I guess. Thank you very much.

[01:51:55.840 --> 01:51:57.260]
Are we gonna get together and jamp out?

[01:51:58.220 --> 01:51:59.100]
Oh, I...

[01:51:59.100 --> 01:52:03.060]
Are you still playing down at that club in the beautiful downtown

[01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:04.600]
Hallondale area?

[01:52:04.860 --> 01:52:06.660]
Yeah, I am at the button south.

[01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:09.880]
I'm surprised Neil hasn't stopped by there because he hangs out in Hallondale.

[01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:11.000]
Yeah, they like me a lot there.

[01:52:11.820 --> 01:52:14.120]
Sonny Rosenberg's throwing a big bash for me there next week.

[01:52:14.880 --> 01:52:15.580]
Big bang.

[01:52:15.920 --> 01:52:16.640]
Yeah, the big bang.

[01:52:17.100 --> 01:52:18.080]
Yeah, they were hot, man.

[01:52:18.340 --> 01:52:20.860]
Did you get together with your keyboard player and...

[01:52:20.860 --> 01:52:23.080]
Yeah, we're doin' that this weekend, but...

[01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:24.080]
Man, I'm serious.

[01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:25.240]
I got laid up.

[01:52:25.340 --> 01:52:26.240]
My arms are all messed up.

[01:52:26.260 --> 01:52:26.820]
You got what?

[01:52:27.620 --> 01:52:28.800]
I got laid up.

[01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:31.460]
I laid down, but laid up, you know what I mean?

[01:52:31.960 --> 01:52:32.800]
What happened to you?

[01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:34.920]
It's up my arms, so we had to cancel last night.

[01:52:35.240 --> 01:52:35.680]
Is that right?

[01:52:35.780 --> 01:52:37.420]
I heard it was a riot, but you know what can I do?

[01:52:38.280 --> 01:52:38.460]
Well, I'm close.

[01:52:38.460 --> 01:52:39.380]
I'll go live in EJ.

[01:52:39.660 --> 01:52:40.120]
Yeah, buddy.

[01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:41.460]
Take it easy, pal.

[01:52:41.620 --> 01:52:42.680]
And I'll get in touch with you, all right?

[01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:43.480]
You got it, buddy.

[01:52:43.780 --> 01:52:44.860]
You can have a...

[01:52:44.860 --> 01:52:47.820]
Don Jr., you can have those pictures if that will do any good at all.

[01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:49.760]
Is that a problem?

[01:52:49.980 --> 01:52:50.580]
You got it.

[01:52:50.840 --> 01:52:51.360]
I'll bring you one.

[01:52:52.520 --> 01:52:54.520]
That'll help a lot of lonely nights, you know what I mean?

[01:52:54.820 --> 01:52:56.180]
No problem, Don Jr.

[01:52:56.520 --> 01:52:57.580]
You guys have a great show.

[01:52:57.720 --> 01:52:58.100]
Take it easy.

[01:52:58.440 --> 01:52:58.940]
Okay, Don.

[01:52:59.140 --> 01:52:59.520]
See you later.

[01:53:00.100 --> 01:53:01.520]
Okay, he's just like his daddy.

[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:03.020]
He's spent a lot of those lonely nights.

[01:53:03.220 --> 01:53:04.280]
Yeah, yeah.

[01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:06.760]
Stan will come by and keep him warm and no question about that.

[01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:11.940]
It's 12 minutes before 10, and we can take a caller to here.

[01:53:12.140 --> 01:53:15.180]
And man, just, you know, then we got Chicago standing by with that eight minute cut.

[01:53:15.560 --> 01:53:16.820]
Also, we do have a couple of minutes.

[01:53:16.820 --> 01:53:18.120]
What's cutting it down from Chicago?

[01:53:18.540 --> 01:53:18.940]
Beginnings.

[01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:20.480]
You can relate to that.

[01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:21.080]
Of course.

[01:53:22.060 --> 01:53:23.480]
I like it's now or never.

[01:53:23.620 --> 01:53:24.560]
It's kind of like the same.

[01:53:25.080 --> 01:53:28.440]
I also had the one that you played during the Irianc contra here.

[01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:28.960]
What was that one?

[01:53:29.660 --> 01:53:30.620]
Conversations or dialogue?

[01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:31.040]

[01:53:31.460 --> 01:53:31.980]
Something like that.

[01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:32.480]
That's a great song.

[01:53:32.580 --> 01:53:32.980]
Yeah, it is.

[01:53:33.160 --> 01:53:34.240]
That's one of the first ones, wasn't it?

[01:53:34.360 --> 01:53:35.180]
You never hear that one.

[01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:37.320]
It was about, what, 69?

[01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:38.660]
Well, one of the days.

[01:53:39.060 --> 01:53:39.340]
One of the days.
