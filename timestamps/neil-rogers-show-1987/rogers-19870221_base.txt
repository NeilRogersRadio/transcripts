[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.980]
well you say that all you want but i'm not going to be nice today it's a

[00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.400]
miserable nasty day and the people in south florida want to continue being

[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.940]
miserable in the steve we're going to do everything in our power

[00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.860]
to make them happy

[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.600]
just had a wonderful conversation with fruit cake who of course is uh... one of

[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.740]
the real rate he's the real reviewer radio in south florida jica and linda

[00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.860]
thorton are you know they do a good job but uh... they pale into win

[00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.940]
significance they aren't nearly on top of what's happening in this business

[00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.300]
as uh... our friend down in kindle is and of course uh... we just had an

[00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.480]
interesting conversation there are rumors i don't want to

[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.180]
spill the beans on the air but there are rumors that someone who used to work here

[00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.740]
on the weekend has gotten his toes on the fire again

[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.200]
in tampa and before i can substantiate those rumors i'm not going to let it all

[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.200]
out including the word that he allegedly said again on the air but uh...

[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.620]
it's just amazing what goes on in this business anyway we do have his

[00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.920]
Kathy uh... promised you are threatened you we have four open hours again

[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.900]
and i'd made mention on her show if you were listening that we do have a lot of

[00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.940]
interesting guest coming up this week and in future weeks in the only reason

[00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.880]
we haven't had any guests in so long

[00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.840]
is because we've been uh... changing producers like some people change their

[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.300]
underwear

[00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.360]
in fact uh... more often and some people change their underwear which is pretty

[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.880]
embarrassing but uh... so we've really been in limbo and of course lori is here

[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.120]
and we're all excited about that

[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.520]
and she has that programming office so organized now that it's like it's like

[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.580]
antiseptic in there i mean you can't uh...

[00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.180]
you can eat off the floor it's so clean

[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.620]
in fact when i went in there this morning i noticed there were a couple of

[00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.720]
the news people eating off the floor was fantastic

[00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.200]
anyway i just want to mention maybe we'll talk a little bit about restaurants

[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.600]
today because last night

[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.940]
it's easy to knock anybody can knock and i do that all the time because the audience

[00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.700]
loves that they

[00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.460]
act i had a let i had a great letter last week from somebody who was uh...

[00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.380]
urging me on they really enjoy when i tear into

[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.560]
institutions or people or whatever and i guess you know they're kind of the same

[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.920]
mentality that i am at the end it said kill

[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.800]
in other words just absolutely rip everybody not i want to do that because if

[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.820]
somebody does a good job

[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.000]
we like to give them credit and speaking of that and he's so chan is going to be

[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.400]
here today and he's topic is the future of eastern airlines is going to have

[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.400]
gym ashlock here

[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.500]
and also ernie is promised he's going to apologize for his intemperate behavior

[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.180]
last saturday when you attack the

[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.980]
campaign on the early bird and all of that mail and when he made that rather

[00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.180]
pathetic plea

[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.900]
for all those young listers of his to send in cards

[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.640]
and uh... ernie and i kind of went through some of his mail together here the

[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.740]
other day and the youngest was about a hundred and seven i mean it was incredible

[00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.180]
even the postcard to look kind of wilted and it was amazing so he's finally come

[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.180]
into the real world and

[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.500]
is beginning to understand where it's at

[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.240]
now christy's is a restaurant in corral gables there was a friend of mine who

[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.100]
uh... had a birthday yesterday i want to mention bill called her name because

[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.520]
somebody over there get all upset

[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.500]
but uh... bill turned thirty nine yesterday and he always writing a message on

[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.620]
the screen now taking a shot at called her leave the man alone he just celebrated

[00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.480]
a birthday he's got that beautiful new car

[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.900]
and that he's got his good friend over there with a pinstripe suit leave the

[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:01.360]
guy alone

[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.380]
uh... all i know used to make fun of me ordering the uh... onion suit well i

[00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.400]
didn't have the old parmesan okay that made him happy because they don't have

[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.220]
that on the menu but they do have great stakes

[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.200]
anyway

[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.860]
i always felt that burn stay-cows intemper had the best french onion suit

[00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.160]
the studio was a close second the studio has

[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.480]
sensational onion suit but i'm talking about with the thick

[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.920]
cheeses

[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.280]
is there such a word is cheeses we got into that years ago when i was in west

[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.260]
palm beach and

[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.000]
today or station

[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.080]
he's the only one who knows anything the rest of us just sit in here and we start

[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.700]
fumbling around and he writes on his messages on the screen and really uh... is

[00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.720]
the nuts and bolts

[00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.280]
and of course with what they pay him it's no wonder that he has a lot of time to

[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.160]
sit up there and read because uh... you know

[00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.420]
it's embarrassing

[00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.680]
anyway he says it was dragged to it by his brother one day and he just couldn't

[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.200]
believe how bad it was and i second emotion trevys

[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.220]
and i saw uh... who's my friend over there a channel for

[00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.300]
see now i'm going to depend on you for everything

[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.320]
what is her name the one who does the little puff feature at the end of the

[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.640]
five thirty news every day

[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.780]
we have a new format now i just ask questions and i'll have kyle fill in the

[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.460]
names robin carter you don't have to give me the

[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.000]
and i saw robin over there and she very nice lady by the way i like her a lot

[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.480]
she's a super person and she did a nice segment on my dating show a few years

[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.120]
ago and she just uh...

[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.820]
a wonderful lady but again why she was eating there i have no idea a lot of

[00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.080]
people who are really and they have marino's pictures all over the walls there

[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.500]
and you think that it would be a really great place i mean guy who makes the

[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:34.580]
pasta primavera

[00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.360]
it says it was covered by contact cement

[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.000]
yeah it was uh... gruesome i mean it was really terrible

[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.020]
and why guy with marino's money would either trevys one has to wonder but you get

[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.280]
the impression that marino uh... he endorses everything you know that he lives

[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.940]
in about eighty different places if you believe all he adds

[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.100]
and uh... hey listen i don't blame a more power to him whatever he can grab

[00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.800]
good luck to him that's what it's all about i've got so many things to talk

[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.960]
about here this morning i really should have made a couple of notes

[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.860]
i was over a channel thirty three yesterday and had a meeting with bob greasy who's

[00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.460]
also a super guy bob is just uh... unnatural

[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.080]
and a really nice guy we're getting ready to do the hurricane baseball game

[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.300]
starting march thirteen on channel thirty three

[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.320]
and who should walk in but a gentleman named gerry car who is from rochester new

[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.960]
york my hometown maybe that's what we'll do today

[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.560]
because i've always said that most of rochester and upstate new york is down here

[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.520]
and i know that the other people in the audience get very upset

[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.360]
very upset not to mention terminally bored when we start talking about that and

[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.020]
that that's good say because it's kind of like an in thing

[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.320]
it's like when the new yorkers from the city start calling and talking about all

[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.280]
the favorite delis in places that none of the rest of us ever heard of and we

[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.100]
don't care we're not interested in that

[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.860]
so this is like kind of getting even but anyway uh... and i thought this man

[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:49.060]
look

[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.640]
the most horrifying movie you'll see this year

[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.920]
happens in broad daylight

[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:11.620]
they look like senior citizens but behind the wheel on the open road they

[00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.720]
become the driving dead

[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:30.660]
yes death travels at five miles per hour dead from the neck up they

[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:36.420]
ceaselessly prowl the streets of the city striking mind numbing fear into the

[00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:41.340]
hearts and minds of drivers everywhere see them come to a dead halt in the

[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:47.040]
middle of an intersection see them ruthlessly ignore stoplights see them drive

[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.980]
all day with a turn signal on so chilling you'll be afraid to drive home from

[00:06:52.980 --> 00:07:00.180]
the theater don't miss the driving dead coming to a dead stop near you

[00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.320]
ten eighteen and w i n z buddy a middle aged in the shameless

[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.120]
would you believe that a certain host in town i don't want to mention Steve

[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.900]
Keynes name because he enjoys it when we uh... pick on him

[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.000]
you know that he had dr bombus on his show yesterday as a good look at car car

[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.580]
is rolling rolling i mean when you talk about being so desperate that you will

[00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.760]
take anybody that you will rip off i when you start taking alan bernard's old

[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:33.140]
guests and i mean old you've reached the end of the line the end of the line we'll

[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:38.700]
get into that and just to wear on a daily basis and you have to the best thing

[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:42.820]
to do is get a scorecard and a pencil with a bigger racer don't get a pen but a

[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:46.700]
pencil with a gigantic eraser and it is changing and frantically moving things

[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.200]
around and just go nuts which is always of course the sign of really knowing

[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:55.000]
what you're doing but uh... when steve can can bring on a guy like dr bombus after

[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.600]
he's had his friend the amazing randy on debunking psychics and pretending to be

[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.580]
uh... poking fun at it i got to tell you that's the ultimate

[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:09.680]
desperation i mean talk about reaching new lows and new levels of desperation that's

[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.580]
what they've done over there just incredible so this market continues to be uh...

[00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:17.180]
more and more bizarre as each day goes by it just uh... you shake your head in

[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.900]
amazement wonder what the hell's going on

[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:22.920]
also can't be mentioned this this morning in frank was reading it on the news over

[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.540]
and over again because we want to make sure that uh... the youngsters out there

[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.820]
know that they're going to have an extra holiday in date county this fall

[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.960]
an extra day off

[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:38.600]
when pope john paul the second comes to south florida that's right in fact the uh...

[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.180]
upi store even says

[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:42.740]
moshi puppet come here is some uh... major

[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.420]
religious figure i'm not talking about one of the government leaders because that

[00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.860]
would certainly never qualify but some major religious leader from israel

[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:53.640]
uh... come to south florida come to visit the beach for example with a declare a

[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.160]
school holiday of course not

[00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:01.220]
if or a robert's came here on his last legs waiting for god to take him desperately

[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:05.940]
begging for those final few million uh... would be declared a holiday in a way

[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.640]
but the pope is going to come here in september and right away the state is

[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.040]
thinking about declaring a holiday and the schools are letting all the kids out

[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.780]
and everybody's just gonna have a wonderful time what is it that he's going to do

[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:21.300]
when it comes here it's bad enough he's coming here president ragan is going to have a private meeting with
