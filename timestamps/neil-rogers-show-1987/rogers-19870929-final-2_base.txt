[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:03.860]
If it doesn't work out, you can leave.

[00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:04.920]
Is that fair enough?

[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.440]
I leave.

[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.560]
I said, I said, I'm the one who leaves.

[00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.540]
Oh, Dave isn't leaving.

[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.020]
When you meet him, you'll understand why.

[00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.720]
Just go get him.

[00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.980]
It's 20 minutes past 11.

[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.740]
Well, listen, now we can't bring all ugly people in here.

[00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.820]
Okay, once in a great while, just a humor me, bring in somebody who looks human.

[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.240]
Okay?

[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.160]
I mean, there's nobody in this building who looks human since that engineer went to Tampa.

[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.860]
We don't want to mention his name.

[00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.300]
He gets very emotional and all his family starts flicking limperists at him.

[00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.560]
He just, they can't handle it.

[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.260]
You know, even his wife, 20 past 11 and wins will come right back.

[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.300]
If you have American or European antiques, they could be worth more than you realize.

[00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:43.780]
Now is the...

[00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.100]
Okay, now let's try to bring a little order and decorum to this show.

[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.060]
Okay, Dave is here.

[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.980]
You got to lost probably.

[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.420]
Am I right?

[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.960]
Do you get lost?

[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.380]
Right.

[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.240]
Bad directions.

[00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.400]
Who is that Kyle over there?

[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.400]
Kyle gave you bad direction.

[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.840]
Yeah.

[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.860]
He doesn't care.

[00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.140]
No, don't use turn on him too already.

[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.540]
Everybody's turned on him.

[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.680]
All right, I'm still on your side.

[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.800]
Okay.

[00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.320]
Yep.

[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.060]
Now what's Gina doing up there?

[00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.120]
She's up there staring and laying is up there staring.

[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.740]
We got half of the staff staring in here.

[00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:12.660]
Do you approve?

[00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:13.540]
I mean, is he okay?

[00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.860]
Is he all right, Gina?

[00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.000]
Does he meet with your approval?

[00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.080]
How many fingers?

[00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.240]
Oh, she's checking them out.

[00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.780]
Okay.

[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.620]
She's turning around.

[00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:22.580]
She says fine.

[00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.300]
On 10 fingers, how many?

[00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.060]
Now on a scale of 10.

[00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.880]
Scale of 10?

[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.920]
A nine.

[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.160]
A nine.

[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.720]
A eight.

[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.520]
We got a nine.

[00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.980]
What's Lee Fowler got a three something?

[00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.680]
Three something.

[00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.260]

[00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.680]
Well, how do you like that?

[00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.840]
You give her a 10?

[00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.100]
Oh, she's nice.

[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.380]
Did you want to do something with her now?

[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.340]
Well, we're doing the show.

[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.500]
I mean, if you guys saw, she's afterwards.

[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.860]
After the show.

[00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.780]
Well, don't hold your breath.

[00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.880]
Well, I'll tell you what, if she's busy,

[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.840]
well, we'll talk about that later.

[00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.940]
So anyway, you brought Dave in here

[00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.400]
and you're hostile with him already.

[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.520]
I want the audience to understand.

[00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:57.140]
Is he hostile?

[00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.320]
Pull that mic up to him.

[00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.920]
Don't just leave him sitting there

[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.200]
like some kind of a nerd.

[00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.800]
You know, show him the ropes.

[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.100]
Talk into that.

[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.760]
But don't eat it.

[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.220]
Just don't eat into it.

[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.560]
Well, I want to sit over there and kneel,

[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.700]
I want to, oh, the controls.

[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.520]
Is that all right?

[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.840]
What do you mean you want to sit over in this chair?

[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.640]
Yeah, you get a nice, like in my lap?

[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.440]
No, not your lap.

[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.540]
We can switch places.

[00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.660]
Yeah, right.

[00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.300]
He just came into room and he's taking over the show already.

[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.220]
No chance today.

[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.060]
Maybe tomorrow you can sit over.

[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.620]
All right.

[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.260]
Is that okay?

[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.600]
Yeah.

[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.680]
I mean, talk about a pushy guest.

[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.620]
See, this is not like Paul who was,

[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.460]
see, he's the opposite.

[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.860]
Paul was like laid back.

[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.220]
Is that the expression?

[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.620]
Are you going to continue harassing my guest?

[00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.340]
Are you going to continue putting everybody else

[00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.040]
to the bottom line is, see, the problem I got now

[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.800]
is that I got two people in the studio,

[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.000]
both of whom want to be the only person in here.

[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.020]
I don't mean with me, I mean just without me.

[00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.280]
Am I right?

[00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.660]
No.

[00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.680]
No, I'm wrong.

[00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.100]
You're wrong.

[00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.700]
Now, what would you do, Dave?

[00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.220]
What would you, if you just sat here all alone,

[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.920]
there was nobody else in here, what would you talk about?

[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.620]
I'd talk about you.

[00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:07.660]
And what would you say?

[00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.500]
Only good thing now.

[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.980]
Oh, yeah.

[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.600]
Look at that, he's winsing.

[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.480]
Look at the expression on his, he was winsing.

[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.120]
I didn't know what was coming there.

[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.340]
He probably, uh,

[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.940]
repeat some of those conversations he had with Brian

[00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.480]
and Josh at the ice cream store.

[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:22.940]
Now, we want to talk about that.

[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.480]
They were that fan, huh?

[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.820]
Yeah.

[00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.440]
Hopefully he's not afraid to tell people his name now.

[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.200]
Who's that?

[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.940]
Brian.

[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:33.560]
Why is that?

[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.180]
I don't know.

[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.520]
He says embarrassed to tell people his name, because you.

[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.600]
This could be all worth it in the long run.

[00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.620]
I like the direction.

[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.940]
I like the direction.

[00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:46.000]
Yeah, I like the direction.

[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.300]
He's real hostile in that.

[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.540]
It's your kind of maternity.

[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.760]
He's embarrassed to tell people his name because of me.

[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.420]
Yep.

[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.960]
Why?

[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.700]
Let's calm up and ask him.

[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.160]
He's at school.

[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.060]
He's in school.

[00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.100]
You want to take him out of school?

[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.640]
He goes to, um, Nova.

[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.280]
Nova high.

[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.700]
No, we could have him paged.

[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.540]
No, no, no.

[00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:06.560]
Now let's not do that.

[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.420]
Little tacky.

[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.860]
He might be in the middle of biology class.

[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.480]
Or something important, learning something.

[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:13.740]
For Jim.

[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.060]
Yeah, Jim 102.

[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:16.880]
Yeah.

[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:20.700]
So what else, Dave?

[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.600]
I don't know.

[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:23.360]
What did I miss?

[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:24.020]
Did I miss anything?

[00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.540]
No.

[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.360]
We might be waiting for you.

[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.160]
Waiting to follow your lead.

[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.200]
All right, let's take a fun call.

[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:32.140]
OK.

[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.920]
Broward.

[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.820]
Broward.

[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.500]
OK, Broward.

[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.660]
Hello.

[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.000]
Neil, how are you doing?

[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.660]
Happy anniversary.

[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.280]
Thank you.

[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.200]
Speak to Dave, sir.

[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.380]
He's hot to talk to you.

[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.160]
Ah, no.

[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.760]
Well, listen, if we're going to get on that truck,

[00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.360]
I get to tell you your guests are terminal.

[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.500]
Come on.

[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.440]
Thank you very much, sir.

[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.280]
He just got here.

[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.040]
How do you know that?

[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.920]
He just arrived.

[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.160]
Well, it's going to be something interesting.

[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.480]
Well, listen, Neil, before you get off,

[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.280]
I got a rush over.

[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.340]
I got to tell you something too.

[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.900]
I think I've got self-advistory for you.

[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.380]
OK.

[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.660]
Listen, I was flipping late night channels last night.

[00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.320]
I came across that the old time tunnel TV series.

[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.760]
Remember that?

[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.540]
Yeah.

[00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.480]
Well, this episode, Joey Pinto with James Harnel,

[00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.520]
four James Down and Lee Merryweather,

[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.240]
that it'd take him through the tunnel back to the 50.

[00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.120]
That's how they did it.

[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.060]
That's how we get to throw y'all.

[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.240]
I think it was called Escape the Yesterday.

[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.380]
Yeah, Escape to the Dark Ages.

[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.100]
Right, who is it?

[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.780]
James Harnel's tumbling through the tunnel

[00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.060]
on the evening, talk up to two.

[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.820]
Wouldn't that be great?

[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.240]
Incredible.

[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:38.020]
OK.

[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.640]
Well, it's now the happy anniversary, Neil.

[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:40.780]
It was great last night, too.

[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:41.240]
You were there?

[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.020]
I was there.

[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.420]
Good.

[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.060]
OK.

[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.580]
Did Brian say anything nasty about anybody last night?

[00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.800]
I don't know.

[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:47.960]
I only saw him for a second.

[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.080]
I didn't know if it was him or the other kid

[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.400]
with the bullfond that was Brian.

[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.460]
Yeah, the one with the bullfond.

[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.340]
Yeah, bullfond.

[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.740]
The one with the hair stick that you put up.

[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.080]

[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.200]
Yeah, that was it.

[00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.600]
OK.

[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.580]
Yeah, the bullfond.

[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.600]
What kind of a road test?

[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.780]
OK, good luck to you.

[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:02.780]
Time to move on.

[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:03.100]
True.

[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.660]
They're ripping everybody today.

[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.120]
We don't rip anybody on this show.

[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.200]
Just dating facts.

[00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:09.520]
Shame on you.

[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.820]
I liked his comments.

[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.000]
Now, who would you like to rip?

[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:13.780]
Me?

[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:14.920]
Yeah, do you want to rip somebody?

[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.140]
Now, OK, see?

[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.140]
Well, he's a positive.

[00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.860]
I think by the end of the show.

[00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:21.220]
By the end of the show.

[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.120]
Like nobody here, we don't want to mention any names.

[00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:24.020]
Dave Kelly.

[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.880]
Dave?

[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.300]
Dave.

[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:28.820]
OK.

[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:29.700]
OK, let's put them on a head.

[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.280]
Dave, hello.

[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.320]
Hello.

[00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:35.960]
Yeah.

[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:36.920]
Is Neil?

[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:37.520]
Yeah.

[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.820]
Turn your radio off.

[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:41.240]
Would you please?

[00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:41.780]
Come on.

[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.800]
Hold on.

[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.600]
Hold on.

[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.180]
I'll play a super dumb OK.

[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.040]
Hold on one second.

[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.800]
God, even Paul turned his radio down.

[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:52.980]
Even Paul.

[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.420]
He just won't let up on him.

[00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:55.260]
What do you want?

[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.080]
Just because he was ugly?

[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.140]
He wasn't ugly.

[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:57.800]
He was OK.

[00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.200]
He was like average.

[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.260]
Lifeguard.

[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:01.280]
Yeah, it was average.

[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.740]
Mail?

[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.560]
Yes, sir.

[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.700]
I didn't say Bork.

[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:05.760]
I said bird.

[00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.160]
B-I-R-D.

[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:07.620]
Bird.

[00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.660]
I think I have an ad in here.

[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.360]
Yeah.

[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.020]
Jesus Christ.

[00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.840]
I saw Sonny Fox this morning.

[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:14.700]
He had a spare banana.

[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.740]
I looked like Peppy Fields and drags.

[00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.760]
Oh, I heard that call the other day, for standard.

[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.180]
You hear that call about the young lady on the beach

[00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.740]
that either want to fix him up with,

[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.540]
and he went through this whole thing, and it was Peppy Fields.

[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:26.660]
Perfect.

[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.560]
Little too young for stands.

[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.820]
I wouldn't do anything like that.

[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:30.200]
No.

[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:31.120]
Listen.

[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.040]
What do you want?

[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.440]
I know you die of bed.

[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:34.180]
I'm by a bed.

[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:35.280]
You can eat all you want.

[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:35.680]
Yeah.

[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:36.640]
Just don't swallow.

[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:37.260]
I know.

[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.840]
Oh, this is the same guy that called about Peppy Fields.

[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:40.960]
Let me explain something to you.

[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.400]
You're the same jerk that called about Peppy Fields, aren't you?

[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.180]
Yeah, you jerk.

[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:45.500]
Get out.

[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.820]
You want to go back to the Broward's desk?

[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:47.500]
Yeah, Broward.

[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:49.280]
Broward.

[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.060]
Neil.

[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:50.600]
Yeah.

[00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.660]
Yeah, it's the bird there with you or is he off for a while?

[00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:53.400]
He's here.

[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.300]
Are you listening to the show or what?

[00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:56.020]
Yeah.

[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.400]
Well, let me tell you.

[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.140]
I'm listening to him out of my car.

[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:00.560]
Is the worm turns?

[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:01.580]
To come call you.

[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:02.220]
OK.

[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.340]
Now, real quickly, I'm a loyal listener.

[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.400]
I've been listening since I don't know if somebody

[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.140]
told me about you months ago, and I've

[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.340]
been listening to you for that long.

[00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:13.500]
I just want to know, is there some way

[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.620]
to take your show on the road?

[00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:17.880]
Well, there are a lot of people who would like that.

[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:21.320]
You know, like Toledo and Oklahoma City and places like that.

[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.580]
No, I'm not really talking far away.

[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.400]
I'm just talking, like, maybe up to Coral Springs, not

[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.080]
to P. August.

[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.820]
No, more like the Melmau Park.

[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:29.300]

[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:30.680]
Now, get a few plugs.

[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.640]
No, I'm not calling for the melting pot.

[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.460]
Listen, we've got some really cute kids.

[00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.720]
And I just thought maybe you'd like to come up.

[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.100]
No, wait a minute.

[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:39.800]
Wait a minute.

[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:40.440]
Wait a minute.

[00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:40.780]
Wait a minute.

[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:41.860]
Cute kids.

[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.580]
Well, understand how that's done.

[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:48.580]
We have some very nice young health seniors

[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.480]
and juniors in high school.

[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.300]
Very good looking young men.

[00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:55.160]
Really?

[00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:59.060]
Some very fine looking for stand, young women.

[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.900]
And I just thought maybe, oh, we also

[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:04.780]
have a very healthy treat for you.

[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.200]
We have a diabetic ice cream.

[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:07.860]
Really?

[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:08.500]
Yeah.

[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.300]
You also have some help who are like kind of in between

[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.060]
for the bird.

[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:13.600]
Yeah.

[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.600]
Well, we have a college aged young person.

[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.720]
Yeah, a young person.

[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:19.980]
Is that about right?

[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:21.240]
Sounds good.

[00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.600]
I don't know which way the bird goes.

[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.900]
If you look real, real boyish, there

[00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:27.780]
are two qualifications.

[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.600]
They have to be boyish and boyish.

[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:30.940]
Boyish and boyish.

[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:31.680]
Yeah, sure.

[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.060]
I don't mean either one of those.

[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.160]
Don't listen to this.

[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.040]
Don't listen to this man, sir.

[00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:38.560]
Trust me, sir.

[00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:39.780]
But anyway, I did.

[00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.940]
In case you wanted it felt like playing around,

[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.420]
it's a take your show on the road.

[00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.600]
How about Larry's up in Coral Springs?

[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:47.500]
Well, you know, we, this is a true story.

[00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:48.420]
In Coral Springs?

[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:49.800]
In Coral Springs.

[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.440]
All right, let me tell you a little bubble,

[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.140]
might see, OK?

[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:52.900]
But it's a true story.

[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:53.600]
OK.

[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.060]
Saturday night, stand, of course, being

[00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:58.700]
in one of his usual desperate moods,

[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.520]
said, let's go up to the ice cream store.

[00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.440]
I said, OK, you know, I always have to humor him.

[00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:04.760]
And of course, somebody might have been working there,

[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.060]
anyway.

[00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.580]
So we go up there and it was crowded.

[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.420]
And we went inside, but we realized we're going to be a long way.

[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.060]
And we're not going to stand online to get an ice cream.

[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.880]
He said, why don't we find out this Larry's place

[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.240]
that everybody's been talking about.

[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.320]
And he thought it was like right up the road, like in Tamarack.

[00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.640]
And I'm driving around and we're looking.

[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.140]
And we couldn't find any.

[00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:23.840]
He said, well, I think it's just a bum's too.

[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:24.740]
There is no such place.

[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.960]
There is such a place that the corner

[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.520]
of Atlantic and University.

[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:30.400]
You know where it is?

[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.140]
Larry's ice cream?

[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:31.400]
Yeah.

[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.220]
It's in the promenade building by Coral Springs.

[00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:33.540]
Quimau.

[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.980]
We have a Coral Springs expert here in the studio with us.

[00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.220]
Oh, very good.

[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.400]
Who looks like a blood shot.

[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.380]
We were going to give you up a little early this morning, then?

[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.200]
Yes, it's my friend.

[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.580]
I've got him up a little before his side.

[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:44.080]
I'm sorry.

[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:44.640]
I apologize.

[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:45.960]
Go ahead, sir.

[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.160]
But anyway, in case you ever want to come up there,

[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.860]
like Saturday night, we're going to have a real nice crew on.

[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:56.340]
And I'm going to be there myself if you want to stop by.

[00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:57.180]
Really?

[00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:00.340]
And I'd love to have you and stand in.

[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.200]
You see it's one thing, but I wanted to show up.

[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.860]
So for example, last night, you know, all this talk,

[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:05.860]
like letter that I would be calling.

[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:06.700]
It was unbelievable.

[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:07.200]
The crowd.

[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:08.180]
I came right.

[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.080]
I came right.

[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.500]
I didn't want to invite you guys up to the place

[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.200]
that had a healthy community.

[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:14.860]
Excuse me, sir.

[00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:15.440]
Niels talking.

[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:15.940]
OK.

[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:16.620]
Thank you, Dave.

[00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.320]
You know, I really wanted to have healthy tree for you.

[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:20.560]
Yep.

[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.680]
So, you know, I just felt that I would come up

[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:24.520]
and I didn't fight you.

[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.360]
But with the crowd, it was there.

[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:27.400]
It was phenomenal.

[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:28.880]
It was unbelievable.

[00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:29.460]
Unbelievable.

[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:30.120]
Right.

[00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.460]
I was starting to say something only moments ago.

[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.520]
Like last night, when I went in,

[00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:41.380]
I got one scoop of strawberry ice cream with some marshmallow.

[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.540]
You know, and that was it.

[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.440]
And I went outside and I started signing you autograph.

[00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:45.660]
I never got to eat it.

[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:46.720]
I had like three bites.

[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.280]
So people who carry on about, well,

[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.380]
you can't go to all these restaurants and eat.

[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:52.920]
But you're eating ice cream every night.

[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.280]
The amount of ice cream that I eat,

[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.920]
you could put in a thimble and have them

[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.220]
for the Chinese army leftover.

[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.000]
All right.

[00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:58.800]
I understand that.

[00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.600]
Not like, uh,

[00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:00.980]
I don't think if you'd like some.

[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.580]
Now, I just want to, I just, sir, don't get defensive.

[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.240]
I just wanted to clarify that.

[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.380]
Okay. I'm just clarifying.

[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.880]
I understand, but no, it's, it's really, it was really, you know,

[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.780]
I really have to put it to your credit.

[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.480]
Yours and stands credit because you had a phenomenal crowd.

[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:16.880]
We did.

[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:17.800]
And they were all wonderful.

[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.340]
I've come to the conclusion that the people who show up,

[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.640]
uh, the silent audience out there, they're the great folks.

[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.640]
The ones who call, you know, not all of them,

[00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:26.760]
because I don't want you to get upset.

[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.580]
The ones who call are primarily a pain in the ass,

[00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.240]
not, not Dave called it a couple of times,

[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.900]
but that's only after we made him a star.

[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:33.920]
Oh, okay.

[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:34.560]
Am I right?

[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.080]
Is that Dave with a melting pot?

[00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:36.600]
Is that for that?

[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:37.260]
The melting pot.

[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:37.760]
Do you know him?

[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.320]
Oh, no, I really don't know.

[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:39.620]
Am I?

[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.680]
He's a wonderful, a wonderful, a wonderful young man,

[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:42.000]
sir.

[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.000]
He's a friday.

[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:44.420]
I love his,

[00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:45.300]
he's the only dressing man.

[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.080]
How do you think he's out of this world?

[00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:48.480]
Friday night at 9 p.m.

[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.400]
By the way, it's going to be nine,

[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:50.620]
because I had a, did you hear that?

[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:51.120]
Yes.

[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:52.660]
Friday night at 9 p.m.

[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.300]
We're going to, you're going to make a reservation this time

[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:54.960]
because we'll be there.

[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:55.960]
I promise you.

[00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:56.500]
Okay.

[00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:59.840]
Well, I think maybe we'll just make a reservation too.

[00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:00.520]
We'll show it.

[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:00.840]
No, wait a minute.

[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:01.700]
Let's slow down.

[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.420]
Did I tell you to cancel a reservation?

[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:04.440]
Do I tell you that?

[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:06.640]
But he is right at battenhamford, Lauderdale.

[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.060]
Yeah, Friday night.

[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:08.340]
See?

[00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:10.100]
Now, did you hear that?

[00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.140]
Oh, I shall.

[00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.720]
Now the truth comes out.

[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:13.040]
See?

[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.380]
But there will be an ad coming in there.

[00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:16.880]
See, that's because you're up in Coral Springs,

[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.880]
which is halfway to Jacksonville, sir.

[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:19.880]
It is not.

[00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:20.900]
It's far, it's not.

[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:21.440]
Come on.

[00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:22.360]
It's coming.

[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:23.000]
Come on.

[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:23.920]
I live up the road.

[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.960]
Listen, I want to tell you, I live in Plantation.

[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.440]
Sir, I live in Plantation.

[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.980]
And to get to Coral Springs, I have to take a freight train.

[00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:30.360]
Okay.

[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.360]
By the time I get there, I want to steal it.

[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.360]
You can use Kyle's directions, you're probably right.

[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:35.640]

[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.240]
Kyle sticks around Pemberk Pines.

[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.240]
He likes to stay close to home and I can't blame him.

[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:44.040]
By the way, he has control over turning your mic on it off.

[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.860]
So it would be very nice to come because he's only

[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.380]
got a couple of days left on this shift.

[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.880]
And then he's the bandening, you know, the whole deal.

[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.560]
It says you weren't paying any attention to the directions.

[00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.180]
That's what he's writing on the screen.

[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.040]
Ah, okay.

[00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:58.500]
Were you paying attention?

[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.960]
Well, when he said left, it was supposed to be all right.

[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:01.820]
All right, I got an idea.

[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:05.880]
Now, how late is this pain in the ass ice cream stir open

[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:06.360]
that you got?

[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:07.120]
11 o'clock.

[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:07.860]
11 o'clock.

[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.480]
And we're going to be eating at nine.

[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:09.920]
Nine.

[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:10.500]
Nine.

[00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.280]
I'm going to have this very first time.

[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:12.640]
You're done.

[00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:13.460]
Chocolate fondue.

[00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:14.500]
Oh, yeah.

[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.480]
That sounds a lot better.

[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.680]
Yeah, so maybe I'll make you a deal.

[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.080]
One, I bring it to the melting pot.

[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.100]
When I go there for dinner.

[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:22.480]
What Friday?

[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:22.980]
Yeah.

[00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:23.400]
OK.

[00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:24.880]
Is that OK with you?

[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:25.900]
Sorry, it was me.

[00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:26.320]
Sure.

[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.020]
Why do they have it here?

[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:27.380]
Maybe that OK.

[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.500]
It's fine with me.

[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:29.020]
OK.

[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:30.080]
Dave says it's OK.

[00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:31.260]
Dave says it's OK.

[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.180]
Now, he'll probably get fired for saying that,

[00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:33.840]
but it's OK.

[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.060]
OK, we'll look for you.

[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:37.540]
OK, I'll look for you too, Neil.

[00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:38.160]
OK, Moishi.

[00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:38.660]
OK.

[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:39.080]
Bye-bye.

[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:39.760]
Bye-bye.

[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:43.820]
Mr. Food strikes again.

[00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:45.780]
You know, why don't they just bring in?

[00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:46.580]
Are you hungry now?

[00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:48.140]
There's a little too early for you.

[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:49.300]
Well, I just woke up.

[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.120]
Why are they setting pizzas on?

[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:54.660]
Pizza down the way.

[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.440]
Don't you love when these people come in here?

[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.520]
It's like, you know, what do you want?

[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:00.680]
You know, what can we do for you?

[00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:01.760]
That's basically what it is.

[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:02.980]
What is it we can do for you?

[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:03.440]
You want lunch?

[00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:04.740]
Lunch is what there's a too early.

[00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:06.260]
Well, we could order it now.

[00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:07.860]
Yeah, and then in about an hour,

[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:09.240]
you could work up an appetite, right?

[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:10.300]
Right, yeah.

[00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:11.380]
We could help you work up an appetite.

[00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:11.900]

[00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:12.880]
We could make you real hungry.

[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:14.800]
Maybe Elvis Jr. would call.

[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:16.820]
Mead and last night for the first piece.

[00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:17.420]
Yeah, I'm really amazed.

[00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:17.860]
He's a great guy.

[00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.320]
I'm really upset I didn't get to meet him.

[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:19.820]
He didn't come over.

[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:20.360]
He's a great guy.

[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:22.240]
He was talking about his daddy.

[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:23.460]
I never talked about that.

[00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.620]
And he had that young lady was in the shower with him

[00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:25.900]
that day.

[00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:27.040]
He did have a bridge.

[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:27.600]
He was really good.

[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:27.940]
Ooh.

[00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:28.980]
Okay.

[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.640]
But he had to go out for a little cheesy five.

[00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:32.520]
Sorry, I missed that.

[00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:34.580]
23 before noon at W.I.N.Z.

[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:35.780]
And Dave is with us.

[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.400]
And sooner or later, we're going to bring him

[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.340]
to a crescendo here.

[00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.200]
So to speak, we'll come back right after this.

[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:41.340]
Okay.

[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.660]
I only want those people who like seafood

[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.660]
and who like the lamp to listen to me.

[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:46.660]
Got your attention?

[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:47.060]
Good.

[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.280]
This is David Glickman talking at you once again

[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.740]
for seafar and the wild, wonderful whiskey creek.

[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:53.500]
Wednesday, seafar, super seafood buffet

[00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:56.320]
and the Coconut's Comedy Club amateur night finals.

[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.000]
First, let's talk about this.

[00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:59.920]
All you can eat seafood extravaganza.

[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.340]
It's a virtual plethora of the best seafood on the East Coast.

[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.740]
And it's all you can eat for only 15, 95 for adults

[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:08.020]
and eight bucks for kids.

[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.740]
Then after this fabulous feast, come on upstairs

Don't miss it this Wednesday.

[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.260]
Seafar on Danya Beach in oddly enough, Danya.

[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:47.120]
W-I-N-C's, Alibraera and cellular one mobile phone subscribers

[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.840]
are linked up to bringing radio's best traffic coverage.

[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.140]
While Al covers the highways from high above

[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.660]
in the wind's traffic plane, cellular one subscribers

[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.900]
can speed dial direct to the wind's newsroom

[00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.800]
with eyewitness reports on traffic at the dashboard level.

[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.720]
If you're a cellular one subscriber, just dial star 94

[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.780]
when you have news and traffic tips to report.

[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:05.880]
And the call is free.

[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.760]
Alibraera and cellular one, radio's best traffic team.

[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.820]
Wait a minute, run this by us again.

[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.380]
What was that you were just telling me?

[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.460]
You go to the chiropractor and he does what to you?

[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:18.800]
Yeah, it's a little chiropractor center.

[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:21.220]
You know, it's kind of interesting,

[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:22.980]
but Dave's only been here like what, 20 minutes,

[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:25.640]
and he's already given 72 12s, you know?

[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:26.920]
Which is okay, that's all right.

[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.320]
Just the cows getting writers cramp from putting him on the lawn.

[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.440]
Okay, you go to the chiropractor and they all know about me now.

[00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.280]
They all know what about you?

[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.820]
That I've owned on the radio and I'm like a star now, Neil.

[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.840]
Yeah, probably because of you, but you're not, you're not,

[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:41.840]
it doesn't bother you.

[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:45.400]
You're not thin skinned like some ice cream scoopers that we know.

[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:48.020]
No, it's just a radio show.

[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.700]
Nobody's going to touch you here, right?

[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.580]
Nobody's going to attack you.

[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:51.920]
Right.

[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:52.520]
What a bet.

[00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:53.920]
Now, just a joke.

[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.240]
Okay, just a show.

[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.420]
And you understand that I understand.

[00:17:59.060 --> 00:17:59.700]
Yeah, it's fine.

[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:00.660]
It's like a soap opera.

[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:01.100]
Right.

[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.120]
Or is he slower one?

[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.780]
Okay, let's, where are we taking our next call?

[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:07.660]
Dave County, right?

[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:08.060]
Dave.

[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:08.620]
Okay.

[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.500]
I mean, there's nothing wrong with lusting, right?

[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:11.840]
No problem with that.

[00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:14.820]
And you love to have every man living in child in the world

[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.000]
lusting after your body.

[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:18.020]
Yeah, I'd like to be like, yeah, yeah.

[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.580]
You think he's trying to tell us something?

[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.080]
Dave County, hello.

[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.560]
Hi, Neil there.

[00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:25.780]
You're speaking to him.

[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:26.380]
Hi, Neil.

[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:26.980]
Hi.

[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.720]
I'm calling from Albany, New York.

[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:29.800]
It's who?

[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.980]
I'm calling from Albany, New York.

[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:32.780]
Who is this?

[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:33.200]
Debbie.

[00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:34.080]
Debbie.

[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.220]
No, not me, though.

[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.460]
Debbie does Albany.

[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.660]
I listen to you all the time.

[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.260]
What are you doing in Albany, Debbie?

[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:41.700]
Yeah.

[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.080]
I just have to back to vacate.

[00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:43.940]
Wait a minute.

[00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:44.940]
I'm going to put you on another line.

[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:45.480]
Hold on a minute.

[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.900]
Let's put her on and over here because that sounds like hell.

[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:48.460]
Are you there?

[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:49.220]
Yeah, I'm here.

[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:49.860]
Oh, that's better.

[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:50.800]
This is where I live.

[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.780]
And I call down there to vacate.

[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.540]
And my mom got me hooked on you.

[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:56.140]
Wow.

[00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.140]
And everybody in my family listens to you.

[00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:02.120]
And I just wanted to tell you that I wish you were up here.

[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:02.160]
Yeah.

[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.140]
No, not me.

[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:03.980]
I don't like Albany.

[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.400]
No, it's kind of dirty and cold.

[00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:07.040]
Thank you.

[00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.600]
All those hills and, oh, it's just a nasty town, yeah?

[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:11.640]
Yeah, a lot of snow.

[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:13.420]
Yeah, already, probably.

[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:18.820]
I wanted to stay for Monday night, but to meet you at the ice cream store.

[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.180]
Boy, it was beyond belief.

[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:21.760]
Was it?

[00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:23.460]
We had an imporring rain.

[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:24.860]
We had over 1,000 people.

[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:25.660]
Did you really?

[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:26.020]
Yeah.

[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.760]
Well, I wanted to stay, but they made me.

[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:29.720]
Not listening to you.

[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.340]
Yeah, that's what it sounded like, Debbie.

[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.120]
Well, maybe we gave her an autograph for some.

[00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:33.440]
Yeah.

[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:34.500]
Or a hard time.

[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:34.940]
Yeah.

[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.000]
My grandmother listens to you?

[00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:37.620]
Oh, great.

[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.260]
My dad listens to you?

[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:39.720]
Wow.

[00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:40.560]
Who does?

[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:41.980]
Yes, who doesn't, though?

[00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:43.380]
Your husband.

[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.040]
You have one of those.

[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.100]
You don't have one?

[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:47.560]
Yes, don't listen to you.

[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:47.920]
Yes.

[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:48.060]
Good.

[00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:49.160]
Well, that's good.

[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:49.980]
You understand, Bill.

[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.660]
Well, when are you coming back?

[00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:55.740]
I'll be back in December for the hot.

[00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.920]
I usually come like about once every other month.

[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.140]
I got a good job up here.

[00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:00.820]
I can get away.

[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:02.340]
Boy, no kidding.

[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:04.300]
Okay.

[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:04.960]
Okay.

[00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:06.340]
Well, listen, it's great hearing from you.

[00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:08.220]
And give my best to all our good friends in Albany.

[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.080]
So well.

[00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:09.720]
Take it.

[00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.280]
And Governor Cuomo, give them a big kiss for us.

[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:14.160]
Okay.

[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:15.480]
Bye-bye.

[00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:16.120]
Thanks, Debbie.

[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:16.660]
Bye-bye.

[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:17.600]
Isn't that nice?

[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:18.520]
Yes, very.

[00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:19.880]
We're big in Albany.

[00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:21.540]
I'm too big indeed.

[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:22.120]
No.

[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.680]
Okay, let's go to Browell.

[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:24.000]
Hello.

[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:24.980]
Hello, Neil.

[00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:26.580]
Say hello to Dave.

[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:27.680]
Somebody say something to him.

[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:27.880]

[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:28.780]
How you doing?

[00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:29.520]
How you doing?

[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:29.720]

[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:30.020]
What's your name?

[00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:30.520]
Paul.

[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:31.200]
Paul.

[00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:31.700]
Paul.

[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:32.000]
Paul.

[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:34.980]
Paul from...

[00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:35.440]
Yes, no.

[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:38.600]
You miss that.

[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:40.080]
I miss what?

[00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:40.580]
No.

[00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:41.280]
Go ahead.

[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:41.840]
I'll tell you what.

[00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:42.300]
No, wait a minute.

[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.300]
I'm going to put this guy on hold.

[00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.140]
Let's do what we did that other day.

[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.100]
You don't have to answer him.

[00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:47.520]
Just put him on three.

[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:49.620]
When I punch one up, put him on three or four.

[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:50.640]
This one's on.

[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:51.340]
There we go.

[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:51.820]
You there?

[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:52.460]
I'm back.

[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.940]
Okay, because it sounds better that way.

[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:55.700]
And you can actually hear what these people are saying.

[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.120]
Well, go ahead, Paul.

[00:20:58.300 --> 00:20:59.640]
Dave, whatever your name is Dave.

[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:00.980]
What's going on?

[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:04.360]
No, now he can hear you better, because we stuck him in your ear here.

[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:08.580]
I was at the coop a couple of weeks ago, and I think I know who the mystery person is.

[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:09.300]
Uh-oh.

[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.180]
He had a spare Bishop out of drag.

[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:12.280]
Close.

[00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:13.840]
But not a match.

[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:14.700]
No, no.

[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:15.740]
There was also a divine there.

[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:16.320]
I can't.

[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:16.440]
No.

[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:18.700]
The two of them were so much close together.

[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:20.420]
I can't tell who it was.

[00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:21.200]
Not quite.

[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.720]
Your series divine was there, wasn't it?

[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:24.240]
Yes.

[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.300]
War wasn't it.

[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:29.540]
God, the first time I was ever at the coop, I got really trash.

[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:30.820]
It was like six years ago.

[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.300]
Yeah, and I ended up dancing with divine.

[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:34.780]
There was something that I'll never see.

[00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:35.920]
Oh my God.

[00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:36.840]
Oh my God.

[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:36.840]

[00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:38.920]
So who divine is?

[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:39.500]
No.

[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:40.000]
Good.

[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.660]
Something to tell your grandkids about, Paul.

[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:43.720]
Yeah.

[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:44.360]
Out right.

[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.260]
Anyway, are you cute Dave?

[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.020]
Excuse me?

[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:48.680]
Are you cute?

[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:49.760]
Am I cute?

[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:50.180]
I don't know.

[00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:50.560]
I asked Neil.

[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:51.360]
Yeah, he's cute.

[00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:54.620]
On a scale of one to ten, how many fingers do you have up?

[00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:55.000]
Twelve.

[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:56.980]
Sounds good.

[00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:58.540]
Trust me.

[00:21:59.080 --> 00:21:59.680]
I'll trust you.

[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:00.420]
But he's an ice guy.

[00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:06.300]
I mean, outside, listen, I got to get this audience over this insanity, you know, this obsession

[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:08.080]
with this external beauty, okay?

[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.460]
I'm not thinking of it.

[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.800]
I mean, there's internal things too, you know what I'm saying?

[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:17.000]
You know, I'm thinking of his mind, you know?

[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.140]
Well, there you go.

[00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:18.900]
Now you're talking.

[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:22.040]
I twist it around, it's not.

[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:25.820]
I mean, like, can everybody look like Jeff Striker, for example?

[00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:26.560]
Of course not.

[00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:28.180]
Dave wants to check that out.

[00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.440]
I mean, Jeff's probably a moron, you know what I'm saying?

[00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.440]
Now he'll ever come on the show because I said that.

[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.320]
He talks like one.

[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.260]
Yeah, he talks like kind of a goofball.

[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:44.120]
Anyway, I wish I'd gone out last night to see you, but I couldn't get out of working so.

[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:49.080]
I mean, just because we have all these Jeff Striker pictures in here, and now, you know,

[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.320]
probably won't hear another word from Dave the rest of the show.

[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.280]
I'll fix that.

[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:53.960]
Yeah.

[00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:55.360]
It's your magazine, Tonya.

[00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:56.640]
Now somebody brought that in.

[00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:59.060]
Some disgusting pervert brought that in here.

[00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:01.180]
Nice.

[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:06.920]
Okay, well listen, is that it, sir?

[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000]
Are you speechless now?

[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.360]
I'm looking through my own pictures of Jeff Striker.

[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:14.420]
I'll bet you where you sound like you were reading a little hard when we punched up the call.

[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:15.520]
That's why.

[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.840]
Anyway, Dave, stop that on Albertsons in Dearshield and say hi to Paul.

[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:19.700]
So.

[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:20.480]
All right.

[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:21.160]
Are you going to do that?

[00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:22.140]
Huh?

[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.060]
Yeah, I'll be there.

[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:24.160]
You can have a busy schedule.

[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.800]
Now, don't say like indifferent.

[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:29.560]
You might make some good friends through this show, right?

[00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:30.200]
Right.

[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:31.240]
Unlikely, I know.

[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:31.980]
Okay, Paul.

[00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:32.560]
Good luck to you.

[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:33.140]
All right.

[00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:35.020]
Listen, we got a lot of desperate people out there.

[00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:35.800]
Humor them at least.

[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:36.480]
Will you put them in?

[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:38.980]
I mean, humoring me, so why not humor some of them?

[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.260]
Okay, where do we go, Dave?

[00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:42.600]
Dave's on.

[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.620]
Okay, whatever one Kyle wants to put on.

[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.480]
We'll let him, you know, do a little something.

[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.400]
Get involved in the show and he's waning days.

[00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:51.240]
You know, do a little something for us before you abandon the ship.

[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:51.700]
Hello.

[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:56.660]
I didn't mean something that little.

[00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:58.460]
Okay, there's nobody on that one.

[00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.300]
Let's try another one.

[00:23:59.620 --> 00:23:59.800]
Hello.

[00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:01.060]
Hi, Dave.

[00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:02.440]
Oh, yes.

[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:03.940]
I want a date.

[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.000]
Who is this?

[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.560]
I don't care what you look like.

[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.840]
It's what's inside the cat.

[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.500]
Is this a male or a female?

[00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:19.880]
I'm a boy.

[00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:22.120]
Somewhere in between, I think.

[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:23.180]
Yeah, they so.

[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.300]
Can we do anything for you?

[00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:27.540]
I think that was the wrong question.

[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.640]
You could do a lot for me.

[00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:29.940]
Yeah.

[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:31.560]
What's your name, sir?

[00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:33.640]
RG.

[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:34.480]
Who?

[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:35.000]
Reggie?

[00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:37.100]
Reggie.

[00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:39.620]
Nice talking to you, Reggie.

[00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:41.900]
Excuse me?

[00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:43.260]
What do you think, Reggie?

[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:44.700]
Goodbye.

[00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:47.320]
I think it's time to say goodbye.

[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.220]
I think it's time to say goodbye.

[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:50.960]
I think it's time to say goodbye.

[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:51.360]
I think it's time to say goodbye.

[00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:54.080]
Okay, I think this could be Dave's last appearance on the show.

[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:55.800]
He's already got one foot out the door.

[00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.020]
And I'll just say that, you know, they're always going to be a few like that.

[00:24:58.520 --> 00:24:59.620]
At least one.

[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.320]
Okay, where are we going?

[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:02.120]
Some brown?

[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:03.040]
Where are we like?

[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:03.700]
Okay, hello.

[00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:04.540]
Hello.

[00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:04.880]
Hello.

[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:05.520]
Hi.

[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:06.620]
Hi, Leo.

[00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:13.400]
You had more people at the Ice Cream Store last night than the Polk had on this cane boulevard.

[00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:16.000]
Yeah, we didn't call it off because it rained.

[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:20.940]
We went right ahead with it and said all of our prayers and brachles and everything went on as usual, you know.

[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.480]
And everybody brought their babies for blessings.

[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:24.020]
Yeah.

[00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:26.780]
And it was, yeah, we baptized about 50 people.

[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:27.520]
About the season.

[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:29.720]
It was very reminiscent of the Pope.

[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:30.100]
Yeah.

[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.160]
You know, I thought about that.

[00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:32.340]
Only our people showed up.

[00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:33.920]
It was throwing.

[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:35.140]
Yeah.

[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:35.820]
Yeah.

[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:45.420]
I'm glad you made a mention that the external beauty isn't what it's, Brian is gorgeous.

[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.940]
I mean, I had to go back for a couple of extra ice cream cones.

[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:49.600]
Yeah.

[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:51.860]
But nobody's home.

[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.540]
Well, yeah, that's a very good way.

[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.460]
And he's a nice kid.

[00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:57.840]
I mean, let's not see.

[00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.760]
These are just innocent bystanders.

[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.900]
They're people who are not interested in being celebrities.

[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.700]
Dave here, for example, wants to be a star.

[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.660]
So he's put himself on a line and whatever crappy gets, he'll have to take it.

[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:11.520]
But these other people are just innocent bystanders.

[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:15.560]
And if they don't want to be celebrities, far be it for us to interfere with their lives, right?

[00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:16.060]
Yes.

[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:18.020]
Well, he is, Dave is trying.

[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:19.840]
I mean, I'll give him that.

[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:20.420]
He's trying.

[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:21.920]
Well, I'll let you exceed it.

[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:23.720]
I'll let you know later how hard he's trying.

[00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:24.300]
Thank you.

[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.080]
Are you out so to speak or?

[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:30.140]
Yeah, I bet you'd like to be here with him is what it's all about.

[00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:30.960]
Isn't that what it's about?

[00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:34.320]
That's impossible, but I don't know.

[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:34.900]
Yeah.

[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.560]
It would be more fun just to talk.

[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:42.500]
Because I don't want to get you really nervous because he makes Brian look like Quasimodo.

[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.040]
Do you ever see the hunchback of Notre Dame?

[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:44.640]
Uh-huh.

[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:45.040]
Okay.

[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:47.200]
True.

[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.120]
Listen, another thing I wanted to ask.

[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.920]
Did you want to see Don know whether report last night?

[00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.540]
No, I didn't see that one.

[00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:57.060]
Well, he said that he was discussing the probability of being a star.

[00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:58.060]
He said, you know, if you're going to be a rain, yeah.

[00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:03.240]
There was a good chance we'd get nailed off and on all my, I had a hard time sleeping.

[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:04.060]
Oh, boy.

[00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:05.400]
It's a good thing Brian didn't hear that.

[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:11.420]
I tell you, the weather report is something worth turning on these days.

[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.760]
I would say that, yes.

[00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:14.900]
Okay.

[00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:16.180]
Well, listen, have a wonderful time.

[00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:16.560]
Okay.

[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:19.260]
When you go back for ice cream, give them all my best.

[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.520]
And we'll see you at the melting pot.

[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:24.740]
Are you going to, well, listen, are you going to come up to the melting pot Friday night, 9 o'clock?

[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:25.400]
9 o'clock.

[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:26.240]
Coral Springs.

[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:28.120]
I don't know.

[00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:29.200]
It's on sample roll.

[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:29.920]
I find a baby sitter.

[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:31.080]
I find a baby sitter.

[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:31.080]

[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.940]
I have to find a baby sitter.

[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:34.100]
Call the ice cream store.

[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:37.320]
They'll probably, uh, spear somebody that I put in the work.

[00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:37.920]
Okay.

[00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:38.400]
Yeah.

[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:39.080]
Okay, bag.

[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:39.640]
Bye-bye.

[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:42.120]
Okay, there's the baby.

[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:43.340]
All of the fall.

[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:45.640]
Coral's the game is with baby.

[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:46.300]
That's a good idea.

[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:50.600]
Now, maybe we could call California for Dave a little later on.

[00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:51.780]
How long could speed of 1 o'clock?

[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.540]
I don't know.

[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.400]
We haven't figured that out yet.

[00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:58.640]
You are a little mysterious.

[00:27:58.700 --> 00:27:59.960]
You do understand that.

[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:00.600]
Am I really?

[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:00.920]
Yeah.

[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.040]
And we don't want to pry.

[00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:03.760]
Okay.

[00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:07.580]
But the longer you become a star, the more things that people want to know about you.

[00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:10.320]
Like when you open up that magazine, what was the comment?

[00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:10.860]
What did you say?

[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:11.400]
Nice.

[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:13.680]
And know what he said?

[00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:14.540]
Is that what you said?

[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:15.160]
Was it?

[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:15.700]
Yeah.

[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:16.600]
I don't know.

[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:20.540]
Well, listen, we got lines for everybody.

[00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:22.720]
You know, we've even got lines for him, which is incredible.

[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.400]
It's connected to the...

[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:26.360]
It's the toll fee number for the Autobahn Society.

[00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:28.540]
Nine minutes till noon at WINZ.

[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:29.860]
We'll come right back.

[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:31.620]
Hello, Pemberck.

[00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:32.620]
Pines, you're on the air.

[00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:33.080]
Hi, Neil.

[00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:33.720]
This is Glenn.

[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:36.040]
I'm at Brick-Oven Pizzeria having lunch.

[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.020]
Do you want me to bring you anything back?

[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.860]
Well, I'm not very hungry, but I haven't eaten yet.

[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:41.660]
What did you have?

[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:43.380]
The Brick-Oven Lunch Special.

[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.980]
A garden salad with freshly cut vegetables.

[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:47.360]
Some garlic bread.

[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.040]
A slice of pizza.

[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:49.820]
And a coke.

[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:52.860]
Would you believe that I filled up for just $3?

[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:53.680]
Okay.

[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:57.920]
Like I said, I'm not very hungry, so just bring me a toastanti pasta.

[00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.980]
A baked ziti with sausage.

[00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:01.480]
A cow's-zoned with pepperoni.

[00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.000]
And two of those little pizzas with onion and green peppers.

[00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:04.900]
Oh, yeah.

[00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:08.680]
You might as well throw in an appetizer and some garlic slices with cheese in mushroom.

[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:09.460]
Okay, Neil.

[00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:10.960]
See you in a little while.

[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:15.100]
Glenn, since the readers of South Florida magazine voted Brick-Oven Pizzeria,

[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:19.300]
the best pizza in all of South Florida, Kyle wants to have dinner there tonight.

[00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:20.140]
What's the address?

[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.920]
It's 7100 Hollywood Boulevard.

[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.220]
Halfway between University Drive and the Turnpike.

[00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:30.980]
That's Brick-Oven Pizzeria's 7100 Hollywood Boulevard in Pembroke Pines, right?

[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:31.440]
Right.

[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.780]
Ah, the falling leaves.

[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:35.880]
They're beautiful.

[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:37.660]
Till you have to rate them up.

[00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:39.900]
Unless you have a snapper high-vac.

[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:44.660]
Be amazing lawn machines that pick up leaves with their powerful vacuuming system.

[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:49.060]
So get a snapper high-vac, walk or rider, and clean up this fall.

[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.840]
Snapper, discover the difference today.

[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:58.400]

[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:33.920]
And be sure to ask about SNAP credit with low monthly payments.

[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.980]
Baby, for news, where?

[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:41.500]
Okay, be sure to come back now because we have very low-main here.

[00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:44.360]
It's seven minutes before noon at WINZ.

[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:45.740]
Just shape up, okay?

[00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:46.740]
I'm trying.

[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:48.560]
Was I wrong about him?

[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:50.580]
He's a nice young man.

[00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:53.340]
Okay, yeah.

[00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:55.120]
When you want to attack him too?

[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:55.380]
No.

[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.740]
You've attacked all my other guests.

[00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:59.420]
Is there anybody you like?

[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:01.460]
I attacked one that I've got.

[00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:02.100]
You attacked Don Agony?

[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.200]
You were one of the best skiler when he came in here?

[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.520]
Skiler calls here himself.

[00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:07.760]
Well, he's not there.

[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.380]
Because he doesn't want you to feel bad.

[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.120]
That's not true.

[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:12.840]
Broward, hello.

[00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:23.640]
Oh, that was good.

[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:24.740]
I heard that.

[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.180]
Okay, let's go back.

[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:26.960]
You put him on air.

[00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:27.740]
Because I'm not...

[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:30.520]
I heard that one.

[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.820]
My batting average is not too good today.

[00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:34.540]
Okay, let's pick one out, Kyle.

[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:38.480]
Whichever one you like, and pick a number between one and ten.

[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:39.280]
Hello.

[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:39.360]

[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:39.360]

[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:39.360]

[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:39.360]

[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:39.360]

[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:39.360]

[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:40.740]
Neil?

[00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:41.220]
Yeah.

[00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:42.160]
All right, how you doing?

[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:42.740]
Okay.

[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.060]
I'm a first time father.

[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:44.500]
Great.

[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:45.900]
I was there last night.

[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:47.000]
You're kidding.

[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.120]
Yeah, I don't have to remember.

[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.020]
I told you I need Steve.

[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:51.780]
And his wife that worked there?

[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:53.800]
You knew Steve?

[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:54.660]
He's more.

[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.260]
His wife works there.

[00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:58.940]
Worthy ice cream store?

[00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:00.020]
No, no, no.

[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:01.780]
Oh, yeah, I remember.

[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:02.100]
Sure.

[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:07.020]
Okay, and his wife gave Steve a half to give to me.

[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:08.760]
If you could, just tell her, thank you.

[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:09.660]
Thank you.

[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:11.780]
Listen, thank you, Steve's wife.

[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:14.760]
That was a pretty good turnout last night.

[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:16.580]
I would say so, yeah, in the rain.

[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:18.800]
Had to be over a thousand people.

[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:19.680]
At least.

[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.080]
Yeah, maybe a lot more.

[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:22.220]
Probably.

[00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:25.860]
Well, just...

[00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:27.000]
I'll just say hi, I guess.

[00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:31.280]
So what were your most lasting impressions of what you saw last night?

[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:35.260]
No, what's his name?

[00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:37.220]
Now, why would you say that?

[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:39.540]
I wasn't even thinking about the old what's his name.

[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:40.280]
Oh, it's there.

[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.360]
The day wasn't even there.

[00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:44.520]
Just the crowd.

[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:45.280]
Okay.

[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:46.880]
So you enjoyed it?

[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:47.300]
Yeah.

[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.220]
Oh, did you see Jill?

[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:52.840]
Yeah, Jill was there and she said she's mailing the pictures tomorrow.

[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:57.260]
So by Friday at the latest, she could all those pictures of the ice cream people

[00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:00.580]
and rob over at Windixie and all these other fantasy people, you know?

[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:00.960]
Right.

[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:04.820]
And we'll have the pictures blown up into posters and we'll put them out on the highway.

[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:08.220]
And we'll make stars out of people that don't even want to be stars.

[00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:09.260]
Okay.

[00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:09.800]
Okay.

[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:10.080]

[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:11.560]
Talk to Jill quite a while.

[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.960]
Yeah, Jill's great.

[00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:14.220]
Jill's a knockout on.

[00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:15.100]
Okay, see you later.

[00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:15.620]
Okay, bye.

[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:16.800]
Bye-bye.

[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:21.000]
Speaking of super stars, what are you bringing in here now?

[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.700]
What did you say three months and seconds?

[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:27.420]
With you, Dovonning?

[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:28.960]
Go Dovonning somewhere else.

[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:29.800]
Would you please...

[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:30.700]
This is the worst.

[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:31.580]
Is it bad?

[00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:32.380]
Oh, God.

[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:33.880]
You mean it's in bad taste?

[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.440]
I mean, no, it's not in bad.

[00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:36.900]
It's just bad before lunch.

[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:40.420]
Oh, it's lunchtime in a record of how sour vomit.

[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.000]
Sour vomit.

[00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:44.160]
How about cheeseburgers from outer space?

[00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:44.580]
There.

[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:45.480]

[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:46.760]
Ain't got no emergency.

[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:48.420]
By Dr. Hacker.

[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.720]
Dr. Racker, by the way, is one that sent that gigantic envelope.

[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:52.460]
Did you see it?

[00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:55.140]
It was, you know, this biggest, that window almost.

[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:56.520]
This biggest, the Carol City.

[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.520]
Okay, thank you so much, Jay, and have a wonderful life.

[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:00.800]
Now, that's new material.

[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:01.160]
Hello.

[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:03.100]
Hello.

[00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:07.000]
Hi, this is my second day listening to you.

[00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:10.900]
And I was wondering why are queer people falling in and talking to me?

[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.620]
Why are queer people calling?

[00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:14.880]
I like to sound like fags, you know what I mean?

[00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:15.420]
Fags?

[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:16.920]
Yeah, like, I don't know.

[00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:18.220]
You mean like, faggolas?

[00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:21.500]
I'm sure that last guy with pretending to sound like a girl.

[00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:23.020]
Well, maybe he is.

[00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:23.920]
How do you know?

[00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:25.620]
He's a guy.

[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:27.300]
Maybe he's a little girlish.

[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:28.080]
Or goish.

[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.900]
For I feel sorry for Dave.

[00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:31.640]
Why?

[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:32.920]
I know he sounds.

[00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:34.660]
Oh, well.

[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.440]
He sounds what, you see me?

[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:37.020]
Tony?

[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:37.900]
He sounds what?

[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:40.700]
I know the word to describe it.

[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:42.520]
I don't sound good over the radio.

[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:43.920]
Is Dave this?

[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:44.660]
Yes.

[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:45.960]
How you doing?

[00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:46.420]
What's your name?

[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:47.000]

[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:48.180]
Karen from where?

[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:51.900]
From Fort Leivdau, but I'm just visiting here.

[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:53.120]
I'm going to some Canada.

[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:55.520]
Oh, that explains this call, yeah.

[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.900]
Okay, and the American-

[00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:59.160]
You Canadians, very homophobic.

[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:03.440]
I know there are no homosexuals in Canada, but that's where it goes.

[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:06.120]
Let me tell you, divine is this?

[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:07.340]
I know who he is.

[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:08.060]
Hi, this guy.

[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:09.680]
No, he's not a guy.

[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:10.660]
He's a thin.

[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:13.100]
I'm a Canadian thing.

[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:15.960]
Why don't you like Canadian people?

[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:19.160]
Oh, some of them, you know, like the Maple Leafs.

[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:21.480]
I'm not into hockey.

[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:22.220]
I know.

[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:22.800]
Okay.

[00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:24.860]
So, what is it that we're doing to Dave?

[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:25.400]
Are you upset?

[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:26.300]
Are you worried about him?

[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.140]
No, no, no, I just feel bad for him because he's a bad guy.

[00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:31.000]
And you guys are in phone damage.

[00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:32.220]
But how about all together?

[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:32.880]
How about you?

[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:33.880]
About me.

[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:37.160]
And how about the young lady that just called moments ago that was salivating,

[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.380]
that was drooling on the phone.

[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:39.940]
He's got whatever he wants.

[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:40.840]
Don't you, it's like a sport.

[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:41.420]
It's like a crank car.

[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:44.400]
It's like a smorgasbord, don't you understand?

[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:47.760]
In other words, whatever turns him on, whatever he wants to sample,

[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:49.880]
it's all there, like on sample road, you know?

[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.380]
You want, Dave, do you want the fake guy's phone here or do you want girl phone?

[00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:57.340]
It doesn't matter to me.

[00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:58.460]
Yeah, so he's flexible.

[00:35:58.520 --> 00:35:59.660]
That's what we try to explain.

[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:01.440]
He's just an old man.

[00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:04.500]
He's an easy-going guy who gets along with everybody.

[00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:06.060]
Why are you uptight about that?

[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:06.800]
What's wrong with that?

[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:07.580]
Isn't that wonderful?

[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.260]
If they want to call me up and say that, that's it.

[00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:11.260]
Yeah, he doesn't care.

[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.340]
If it helps them, he's delighted.

[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:14.640]
Okay, that's good.

[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:16.540]
And if we helped you, we're delighted.

[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:17.240]
All right.

[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:18.320]
Are we going to see him Friday?

[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.240]
Are we going to see it Friday?

[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:22.040]
Are you coming up to the Melding Pot Friday?

[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:22.980]
Do you have dinner with us?

[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:24.540]
No idea where the Melding Pot Friday is.

[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:26.360]
It's on sample road in Coral Springs.

[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:27.360]
Okay.

[00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:29.460]
755-6368.

[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:30.200]
Okay, give it a shot.

[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:31.440]
Okay, enough plugs here today.

[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:35.380]
Okay, we're going to pause now if anybody wants to bring a little lunch by, a little later

[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:38.500]
on because Dave is a hungry, growing boy, that would be okay.

[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:39.720]
Mike Wolf's got the headlines.

[00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:42.640]
CBS has the world news, including all the sponsors.

[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.220]
Here again, Neil Rogers.

[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:47.800]
1207 at W1Z, notice who is conspicuous by their absence.

[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:49.560]
Bird.

[00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:51.020]
Yeah, not in the room.

[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:53.840]
He said he was going to live.

[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:57.340]
You know what this behavior has been very, very peculiar.

[00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:59.000]
Something's definitely wrong with him.

[00:36:59.280 --> 00:36:59.360]
Yeah.

[00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:01.820]
You have noticed that, haven't you?

[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:02.960]
Strange.

[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:06.440]
I mean, always strange, but today, bizarre.

[00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:08.080]
See if it's a little depressed about something.

[00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:08.480]
Yeah.

[00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:10.420]
Like maybe some of the limelight.

[00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:16.140]
And especially two days in a row that we've had, you know, just guessed, listeners pop in here

[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:17.620]
and just sit in on the show.

[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:18.940]
It's like no big deal, right?

[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:19.580]
Right.

[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.360]
Wouldn't bother me.

[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.040]
No word to be found.

[00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:32.000]
Now, maybe Brickov, Brick Oven will send over a little something because we do have a celebrity guest in the studio.

[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:37.480]
We might, you know, I'm not going to overdo it after that big speech before about being force fed all that food.

[00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:43.880]
You know, maybe a couple of little pizzas and antipasto, one of those big CDs and some stuff like that.

[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:44.140]
Fun.

[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:45.200]
Be available.

[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:50.240]
Okay.

[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:52.240]
Now, at great expense, we're going to play this.

[00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:02.040]
Boy's want sex in the morning, sex in the morning.

[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:12.300]
When I'm not my best want, sex in the morning, petting and pawing, tearing out my breath.

[00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:19.940]
I want someone who's wins, someone to pin, someone to underpay.

[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:27.700]
I want someone to fall on, someone to crawl on, someone have a way.

[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:35.220]
I want sex in the morning, sex in the morning, covers at my knees.

[00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:39.800]
I want rotten condition, path of position.

[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:50.320]
I am a trapping one, someone who's sleepy, someone who's keeping nothing into taste.

[00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:58.060]
I want somebody first hand, someone to first and then go back to sleep.

[00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:07.040]
There is nothing I like better than a juffle now and then.

[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:14.040]
With the hands under the sweater and the back that starts to bend.

[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:21.320]
But before my eyes are open, I don't want to have too hard.

[00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:29.980]
From a simple turn still poking with a thimbleful of pride.

[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:42.300]
Boy's want sex in the morning, sex in the morning, soiling the sheep.

[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:49.220]
Sex while I'm yawning, suddenly spawning, when I'm half asleep.

[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:57.420]
I want someone unconscious, somebody not just waiting for a thre is one.

[00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:04.160]
Sex with surprises, sex with some rises, someone on the pill.

[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:13.540]
There is nothing like a lover who can satisfy your needs.

[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:20.200]
And the joy when you discover just how often he succeeds.

[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:27.160]
But before my eyes can focus, I don't need him to surprise.

[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:35.680]
By descending lights, the low kiss on the field of sleeping fog.

[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:47.480]
Boy's want sex in the morning, sex in the morning, when I'm still not fresh.

[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:54.880]
I want something that strikes him, someone who likes them, falling their blood.

[00:40:54.880 --> 00:41:02.760]
I want someone to take them, someone to break, and comment on their side.

[00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:12.080]
I want someone to pride in someone who not, and then just close her eyes.

[00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:41.960]
I want someone to take them, someone to break, and then just close her eyes.

[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:41.960]

[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:41.960]

[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:42.060]
I want someone to take them, someone to break, and then just close her eyes.

[00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:43.100]
Wait a minute.

[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:50.860]
I'm like a dagger through my heart, I can't believe he said it.

[00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:57.280]
Except in the morning you said it.

[00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:59.700]
No, I heard a lot.

[00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:01.260]
You're not up in the morning, right? You could get up better.

[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:02.620]
I used to.

[00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:03.780]
No, I mean more.

[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:04.380]
No.

[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:08.660]
Do I want to tell us why?

[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:10.480]
We don't want to get to work in the morning.

[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.880]
I don't work in the morning.

[00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:14.340]
We don't want to pride, you know.

[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:15.940]
Now I have sex in the morning.

[00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:17.020]
Oh, okay. Good.

[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:20.180]
Well, listen, now see, now he tells us that it's afternoon.

[00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:22.200]
Now it's a quarter after 12.

[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.120]
Okay, let's take some more calls.

[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:24.860]
Davis here.

[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:32.440]
There's an empty chair, and from what we understand, there are rumblings around the building that the bird's beak is in the group position.

[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:33.980]
What did we do to him?

[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:35.880]
What have we done to him?

[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:37.460]
Can you explain it to me?

[00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:38.500]
I have no idea.

[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:42.720]
Paul said right in the seat that you're in yesterday, he was a very nice guy.

[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:48.080]
He was a little nervous when he first came in and he loosened up a little, but he didn't say a lot.

[00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:51.540]
He ate some lunch, which he had to grab away from Mr. Nerd over here.

[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:53.620]
That was about it.

[00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:55.180]
There was nothing, and we had a good time.

[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:59.880]
I don't recall anything negative about the show whatsoever yesterday.

[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:00.700]
Nothing.

[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:03.960]
Even the callers were good, which on this show is a miracle.

[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:09.060]
I'm telling you just an absolute wreck today.

[00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:11.160]
We haven't even got a cackle out of him yet.

[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:12.160]
Maybe you got him nervous.

[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:13.020]
Is that possible?

[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:14.260]
It could be.

[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:16.500]
I think something happened last night to him, actually.

[00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:21.700]
Because I noticed that when he put his hand on your leg that he was starting to get tremble.

[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:27.860]
Okay, let's take some more calls, and we'll just press on, and if that's the way it's going to be, that's the way it's going to be.

[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:30.720]
These emotional people, I can't deal with all of it.

[00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:31.260]
Hello.

[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:32.520]
Hello.

[00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:33.720]
Hi, Neil.

[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:34.140]
Hi.

[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:35.220]
Sharon, how you doing?

[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:36.440]
Sharon, how are you?

[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:37.380]
Okay, I'm sorry.

[00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:41.460]
I wanted to stay out for a while and get to talk to you, but it was so insane there.

[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:42.240]
I know.

[00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:44.360]
I couldn't believe what a scene that was.

[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:45.700]
It was great though.

[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:46.440]
It was really good.

[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:47.880]
Everybody had a really good time.

[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:50.740]
There were so many nice people in one place at one time.

[00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:51.280]
That's right.

[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:53.200]
It was really, really a lot of fun.

[00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:54.460]
And Glenn was really nice.

[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.380]
Well, I know more.

[00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:57.300]
Not anymore.

[00:43:57.580 --> 00:43:58.880]
He's made a quick turn.

[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:00.840]
You know how they say the worm turns?

[00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:01.700]
Yeah.

[00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:06.680]
I think he ate a few of those worms at the ice cream store last night.

[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:08.760]
Now tell me how Dave compares to Brian.

[00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:11.140]
You weren't listening before, were you?

[00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:12.360]
No, I came on in.

[00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:12.820]

[00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:16.840]
I said that Dave makes Brian look like Quasimodo on a bad day.

[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:17.940]
Oh, well.

[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:18.480]
He is.

[00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:19.940]
He's a very nice looking young man.

[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:21.400]
He's got a very pleasant personality.

[00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:21.900]
He's flexible.

[00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:22.900]
He's not afraid.

[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:24.580]
He's not embarrassed and uptight.

[00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:27.020]
He's very extraordinary.

[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:28.980]
Did you get to speak to Brian last night?

[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:37.640]
Brian was not what you'd call in a friendly frame of mind.

[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:38.480]
That's too bad.

[00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:38.800]
No.

[00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:40.040]
Nor was Josh.

[00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:46.060]
I'll tell you who's, and I don't want to start getting into a whole thing and rehash, or kill her hash, or any of that.

[00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:50.120]
But one of the nicest people up there is Michelle.

[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:54.980]
I must tell you she is just a beautiful young lady and very nice personality.

[00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:55.600]
She's pleasant.

[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:56.360]
She's friendly.

[00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:58.960]
I get the feeling that Dave is a very nice person.

[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:02.880]
I get that there are some of the people I want to mention, names, who are a little uptight about all this.

[00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:09.540]
Like Dave said, the fame is so they're embarrassed and are afraid to let anybody know who they are and all of this other stuff.

[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:12.240]
I can understand that they're kids.

[00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:13.520]
Oh, yeah, that's true.

[00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:13.960]
They're our kids.

[00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:16.100]
But it was such a really warm, nice crowd lift.

[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:17.220]
I mean, they're miners.

[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:18.940]
I mean, like David at least is 18.

[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:19.920]
You know what I mean?

[00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:20.540]
Yeah.

[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:23.380]
Like there's a line that you draw there between 17 and 18.

[00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:23.920]
Try.

[00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:25.340]
You know, like the law.

[00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:26.100]
No.

[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:28.500]
I mean, seriously, like those people are kids.

[00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:30.080]
Where is Dave?

[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:31.120]
Dave is an adult.

[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:32.060]
He's a man.

[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:34.360]
So to speak.

[00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:37.120]
Did you try any of the cookies I gave you?

[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:38.940]
Oh, those are killers.

[00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:39.500]
They're great.

[00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:40.620]
Oh my God.

[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:41.380]
Shame on you.

[00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:42.260]
You shouldn't have done that.

[00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:44.200]
I just wanted you to try them.

[00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:46.100]
You can't eat only 10 of those.

[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:47.960]
Let me tell you right now.

[00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:50.000]
Those were just devastating.

[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:51.900]
Okay, good.

[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:52.720]
I'm glad to like them.

[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:55.360]
I'll try to make them up to the melting pot Friday night.

[00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:59.640]
But listen, I guarantee you you could bet your life on it.

[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:03.400]
If we have a tornado, we will be there because I wouldn't let Dave down.

[00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:04.480]
Can you make Dave?

[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:06.440]
Can you make reservations like how far in advance?

[00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:08.940]
I would make them as soon as possible.

[00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:09.480]
Okay.

[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:10.900]
Real good, I'll.

[00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:11.640]
Friday at nine.

[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:12.180]
Don't forget.

[00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:13.220]
Okay, I'll be there.

[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:14.340]
Have you been there before?

[00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:15.420]
Oh, you were there last week.

[00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:16.460]
Well, I went there.

[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:17.260]
I didn't eat there or anything.

[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:19.580]
I just went there and looked for you and they said you were...

[00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:20.820]
Well, what good is that?

[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:22.740]
They want you to come and spend your money.

[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:23.840]
They want you to come and eat.

[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:24.880]
Hi, sir.

[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:25.640]
How's it going?

[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:28.200]
Somebody was there who ate and was looking for us.

[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:29.100]
They said it was fantastic.

[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:29.780]
Right.

[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:30.200]
Okay.

[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:32.040]
This time I'll definitely eat whether you're there or not.

[00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:34.220]
No, no, we're going to be there.

[00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:35.480]
Don't say whether we're there or not.

[00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:36.300]
We're going to be there.

[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.040]
Trust me.

[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:37.520]
Okay.

[00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:38.180]
Okay.

[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:39.080]
I'll see you then.

[00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:40.820]
And only if Dave waits on us.

[00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:41.700]
That's for absolutely.

[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:43.340]
Now, how do we know that you're going to wait on us?

[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:45.540]
How many waiters work there?

[00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:47.100]
Oh, we'll have about eight.

[00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:48.900]
Well, how do we know we're going to get you?

[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:51.960]
Oh, we don't.

[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:53.520]
Well, of course you're going to get me.

[00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:55.540]
You just request me.

[00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:56.300]
Right?

[00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:56.920]
Really.

[00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:57.440]
Right.

[00:46:57.540 --> 00:46:57.860]
Okay.

[00:46:58.220 --> 00:46:58.580]
Do you hear that?

[00:46:58.960 --> 00:46:59.540]
I heard that.

[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.300]
You're going to be my only table of the night.

[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:03.180]
Oh, you see that?

[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:04.020]
Mm-hmm.

[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:04.640]
I can hear you.

[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:06.400]
Listen, Neil, can I get to sit with you at the table?

[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:08.080]
Yeah.

[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.340]
Is there anyone who can do that?

[00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:09.700]
Yes.

[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:10.380]
Okay.

[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:11.460]
Because I like you.

[00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:11.800]
Okay.

[00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:12.840]
Save a seat for me.

[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:15.940]
Are you not bringing any of those boyfriends or any of those...

[00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:18.100]
I'll just maybe bring my husband or I'll come myself.

[00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:18.760]
Oh, your husband?

[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:19.660]
Yeah, that would be okay.

[00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:22.000]
I mean, you know, for once make it legitimate, you know?

[00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:22.260]
Okay.

[00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:23.420]
I mean, this is the only...

[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:26.480]
You know, I don't want to say tramp would be a terrible word, but...

[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:26.480]

[00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:27.900]
Just a joke, Sharon.

[00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:28.360]
Come on.

[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:28.900]
Okay.

[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:29.440]
Lighten up.

[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:31.080]
All right. Great.

[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:32.300]
It's great talking to you, Neil.

[00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:33.820]
All right. So what should we do?

[00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:35.320]
Should we make the reservation for...

[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:37.420]
Because I don't want all these other people want to get in the act,

[00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:38.940]
because we can't do anymore, you know?

[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:39.640]
Okay.

[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.560]
But we can certainly have dinner with you.

[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:42.840]
Okay. Sounds good.

[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:43.340]
Okay.

[00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:43.940]
See you Friday.

[00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:44.520]
Thanks.

[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:44.900]
Bye.

[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:46.200]
How do you like that?

[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:47.120]
Unbelievable.

[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:48.880]
Is this going to be exciting or what?

[00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:50.280]
Yeah, it should be a great time.

[00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:51.920]
Should be fantastic.

[00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:52.520]
Yeah.

[00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:54.960]
We'll set you up in a great big table.

[00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:55.700]
Great.

[00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:57.040]
Have a little party back.

[00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:57.280]
Yeah.

[00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:00.140]
And we'll kind of like see you in the middle and everybody can stare at you.

[00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:02.040]
Yeah, we'll cover me in chocofon, do.

[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:08.140]
Dave, try to restrain yourself, okay?

[00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:10.380]
All right.

[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:12.040]
Because I have a lot of great lines for that.

[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:13.200]
But it's a family show.

[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:14.420]
It's a family show.

[00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:16.420]
You notice this chair?

[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:17.360]
Empty.

[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:18.240]
Empty.

[00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:22.820]
I don't want you to feel guilty.

[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:24.340]
I got a good idea for you.

[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:25.500]
Move over in that chair.

[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:28.000]
Because all day yesterday, Paul wanted to sit over here.

[00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:29.860]
And I said, now the bird sits there.

[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:31.720]
See, pretty soon I'll have him right over here.

[00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:33.100]
No, but you sit there.

[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:34.880]
And now that's a hint, isn't it?

[00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:36.580]
Okay.

[00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:39.180]
Doesn't it feel better sitting over in that chair?

[00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:39.600]
Yes.

[00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:40.740]
Yeah, better position.

[00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:44.340]
Okay, let's take the next call here from a date I do believe.

[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:44.680]
Hello.

[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:45.480]
Are you doing new?

[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:45.900]
Good.

[00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:46.500]
What's up?

[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:50.920]
Listen, I just got finished watching my third Jeff Striker movie.

[00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:52.720]
Oh, you'll be ill in that bit.

[00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:54.700]
I was telling you.

[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:55.680]
I never see anything.

[00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:58.140]
It's a good thing he can do what he does because he can't act.

[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:00.380]
Yeah, he's got a limited vocabulary.

[00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:01.720]
There's no question about that.

[00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:02.220]
Sure.

[00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:03.100]
That's true.

[00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:04.460]
Now my neighbor gave me a cassette.

[00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:06.460]
It has three Jeff Striker movies on it.

[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:06.900]
It's pretty good.

[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:08.020]
Your neighbor gave you what?

[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:10.420]
A cassette with three Jeff Striker movies on it.

[00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:12.300]
Okay, what kind of neighborhood you live in, sir?

[00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:12.400]
That's right.

[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:12.400]

[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:13.540]
I don't know.

[00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:15.980]
I don't know.

[00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:16.740]
Oh, yeah.

[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:18.320]
Oh, yeah.

[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:19.480]
Okay, go ahead, sir.

[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:19.860]
I'm sorry.

[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:24.240]
I had a question for Dave.

[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:25.420]
Cover your ears, Dave.

[00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:28.860]
Do you have anything in common with the Jeff Striker?

[00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:30.980]
Not that I know of.

[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:31.980]
Wait a minute.

[00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:32.340]
Wait a minute.

[00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:36.660]
All right, just a minute.

[00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:38.580]
I'm going to open to a page.

[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:40.440]
Whatever page this is.

[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:41.920]
All right, now you can look at the picture again.

[00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:43.960]
Ask the question again, sir.

[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:46.520]
Do you have anything in common with Jeff Striker, Dave?

[00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:47.580]
Yes.

[00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:48.680]
Oh, okay.

[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:50.960]
I think he's trying to tell you something, sir.

[00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:52.940]
Do we have a, David, have a phone number?

[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:56.060]
If he does, you're not going to get it.

[00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:57.120]
I'll tell you that right now.

[00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:00.500]
It's my job to protect our guests.

[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:00.940]
Okay.

[00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:01.560]
The audio.

[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:05.980]
See, we make you a superstar.

[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:07.000]
You know, you're super.

[00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:08.500]
Wanted by the whole human race.

[00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:10.060]
Yeah.

[00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:11.260]
Wouldn't that be great?

[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:12.340]
Yeah.

[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:13.480]
And it's all because of you.

[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:16.000]
Okay.

[00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:20.140]
Well, let's take our next call and braw it.

[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:20.400]
Hello.

[00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:21.660]
Hello.

[00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:23.980]
A rate called Food is on the way from Brickovan.

[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:24.720]
How do you like that?

[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:25.180]
Great.

[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:25.940]
Is that service?

[00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:26.720]
Unbelievable.

[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:27.960]
Is that service or what?

[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:29.880]
Service beyond belief.

[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:30.320]
Hello.

[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:31.240]
Hello.

[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:31.880]
Yes.

[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:32.440]
Hi.

[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:33.120]
Hi.

[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:33.960]
Who's this?

[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:34.860]
It's Chrissy.

[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:36.120]
Chrissy.

[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:36.840]
Wow.

[00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:37.380]
Chrissy.

[00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:39.380]
Chrissy from the mountain pot.

[00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:39.800]
Yeah.

[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:40.720]
How you doing?

[00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:41.460]
Okay, how are you?

[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:43.620]
Now, Chrissy, let me tell you about Chrissy.

[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:43.900]
Please.

[00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:46.680]
She quit her job just so she could listen to the show today.

[00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:47.060]
No.

[00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:47.660]
Come on.

[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:49.040]
Am I right?

[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:50.480]
No, I didn't quit.

[00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:51.800]
What did you do?

[00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:53.080]
I just took off for the day.

[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:53.400]
Yeah.

[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:54.560]
She took off for the day.

[00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:55.100]
She's goofy.

[00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:55.440]
For you.

[00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:56.640]
No for you.

[00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:57.600]
She wanted to hear you.

[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:00.560]
So what are you doing over there, Chrissy?

[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:02.440]
Nothing just listening to you guys on the show.

[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:04.700]
Dave's doing a really good job at playing with you.

[00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:05.780]
And you work with Dave?

[00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:06.520]
Yeah, I do.

[00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:07.700]
How long have you known him?

[00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:10.520]
Since what, Mark?

[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:11.380]
Ever?

[00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:12.960]
And how well do you know I'm Chrissy?

[00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:14.000]
Pretty well.

[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:14.620]
Really?

[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:15.060]
Yeah.

[00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:16.680]
Like real well?

[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:19.160]
Like, no.

[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:20.280]
No, just close friends.

[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:21.040]
Oh, I see.

[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:22.780]
No, I'm, listen, I'm not prying.

[00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:24.080]
I'm not trying to get, you know.

[00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:25.420]
No, we're pretty close now.

[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:26.220]
Pretty close?

[00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:27.160]
Yeah, we're pretty close.

[00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:28.620]
Real close.

[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:29.280]
Yeah.

[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:29.580]
Yes.

[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:29.780]

[00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:30.400]
Huh?

[00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:31.420]
The red tape says.

[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:32.140]
Okay.

[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:36.400]
See, there's kind of an interesting relationship in other words.

[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:39.480]
Like Dave thinks you're pretty close and you think like, you know, he's okay.

[00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:41.500]
Whatever, whatever.

[00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:41.960]
Yeah.

[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:44.460]
Is this your first time calling?

[00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:45.120]
Yeah.

[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:48.460]
Well, I've been called, I called before, but I never got through it so finally I did.

[00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:50.420]
Okay, great.

[00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:52.960]
Well, listen, it's been exciting, Chrissy.

[00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:54.640]
Okay, yeah, I'm happy, really.

[00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:56.720]
Is this your first time calling, ever?

[00:51:57.260 --> 00:51:59.580]
I'm not ever, but the first time I got through.

[00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:03.020]
Boy, what a, what a day, huh?

[00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:03.380]
Yeah.

[00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:06.600]
You take off from work so you can hear your boyfriend on the ear.

[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:07.600]
Yeah.

[00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:09.820]
And what, why did you laugh when I said that?

[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:12.020]
Is that the wrong expression to use?

[00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:14.460]
Well, he's not my boyfriend, really close friends.

[00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:15.540]
We're just close friends.

[00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:17.360]
Yeah, but I just wanted to tell him that he's been really close.

[00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:19.460]
See, I'm getting, I'm getting some mixed signals here.

[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:25.060]
Like he said you were real close and he smiled like, you know, like there was something there that, you know.

[00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:28.520]
Now Michael, I'm just joking if you listen.

[00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:30.200]
Now I'll be curious.

[00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:30.660]
Ooh.

[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:32.460]
Well, wait a minute.

[00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:33.080]
Oh, boy.

[00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:37.220]
Now, see, now we've reached a point in the show where I think we may have nowhere to go back to.

[00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:37.660]
You know what I mean?

[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:39.820]
Okay, listen, it's great hearing from you.

[00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:42.580]
Okay, Neil, I really enjoy you so I want to see a Friday night.

[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:43.900]
We'll be there with Belzon.

[00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:44.760]
Yes, he missed you.

[00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:45.400]
Thanks, Chrissy.

[00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:45.940]
Bye-bye.

[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:46.200]
Bye-bye.

[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:46.860]
No, we'll be there.

[00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:47.380]
Trust me.

[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:50.560]
You'll have so many people there you won't know whether the screamer eat a banana.

[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.080]
Don't you find it bizarre that he just kind of waddled out of here?

[00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:01.540]
And look at Kylie's having hysterics.

[00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:04.340]
He's going into a coma from all of that.

[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:07.260]
Just waddled out of here and he just never will be seen again.

[00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:08.540]
I mean, what is his story?

[00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:11.160]
Mr. Jellis?

[00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:12.560]
Of what?

[00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:18.040]
I think we need to have a talk, you know, like that.

[00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:18.660]
Just let us know.

[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:22.460]
No, don't you think we need to have a talk with him like about the birds and the bees, stuff like that?

[00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:23.360]
No, seriously.

[00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:24.140]
I'm not joking.

[00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:26.580]
23 past known at W.I. and Z.

[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:30.760]
Dave is here today and the other thrown is empty, but life goes on.

[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:33.100]
Well, we have bowling on Monday night.

[00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:36.360]
I used to be a good borer that may come as a shock to you, but I used to have it at 280.

[00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:37.700]
I used to bowl in three leagues.

[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:39.140]
That's better than me.

[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:41.560]
Back in my Michigan days, many years ago.

[00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:43.620]
Well, Leo, we have a league on Monday night.

[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:45.440]
But I haven't picked up a ball in the year, sir.

[00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:46.760]
A bowling ball at it.

[00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:47.860]
So it doesn't matter.

[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.240]
We have a league on Monday nights.

[00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:49.960]
It's gay bowling.

[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:51.200]
Gay bowling?

[00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:52.860]
Oh, boy.

[00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:54.360]
About 160 of us.

[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:55.240]
What do you guys do?

[00:53:55.460 --> 00:53:56.880]
Ballside saddle or what?

[00:53:58.140 --> 00:53:59.460]
No, no, no, it's a lot of fun.

[00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:00.780]
I'll bet.

[00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:03.720]
And we've all, you know, we've all think it's a good idea for you to come.

[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:04.940]
Now, I want to ask you one question.

[00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:06.480]
How many holes are there in the ball, sir?

[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:07.440]
Three.

[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:08.560]
The conventional three.

[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:09.020]
Very good.

[00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:09.700]
That's excellent.

[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:10.520]
And finger tip, of course.

[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:11.580]
Keep all your fingers occupied.

[00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:12.080]
Good.

[00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:15.580]
Anyway, I think it would be a great idea for you to come by.

[00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:16.620]
Maybe you got at least one by ten.

[00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:19.680]
And you'd probably like to invite Dave to come and bowl in the league two note doubt.

[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:20.100]
Of course.

[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:22.280]
That's not a Pizali, so to speak.

[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:24.660]
Oh, you don't have to be gay to bowl, you know, it's not really.

[00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:25.300]
Oh.

[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:26.480]
Most bowlers aren't gay.

[00:54:26.980 --> 00:54:29.200]
Matter fact, most bowlers are what?

[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:30.600]
Are gay or not gay?

[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:31.340]
No, are not.

[00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:32.500]
Oh, I'm glad you said that.

[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:34.180]
I thought we were going to get into professional wrestling.

[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:34.980]
We gave you a bowl of bowling alley.

[00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:37.700]
See, let me say something to you in all seriousness.

[00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:38.100]
Okay.

[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:39.160]
And this is nothing to do with you.

[00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:40.260]
It just came to my mind.

[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:41.940]
And now is a good time to say it.

[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:42.160]
Okay.

[00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:42.560]
All right.

[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:44.860]
One of the things, no, I want you to listen.

[00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:46.020]
I want you to respond to it.

[00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:49.480]
One of the things that people in this audience, many of them, including the dirtiest,

[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:54.260]
minded, sickest ones, the ones who think that I'm the pervert, these people don't understand.

[00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:59.300]
It's very possible to have friends and not have sex with them, isn't that right?

[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:00.480]
Absolutely.

[00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:06.700]
For example, all of the straight males in the audience who got male friends, okay?

[00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:07.700]
They got a lot of friends.

[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:10.240]
They don't have sex with them, but they have friends.

[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:11.940]
And some of them are good friends, okay?

[00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:14.500]
The women out there who go shopping with their lady friends.

[00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:17.780]
When they go home, they don't, you know, do what does lesbian and dilate.

[00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:19.680]
I mean, they're just their friends.

[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:23.600]
And it's, you know, life is in rich, for example.

[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:28.360]
Dave here is a nice guy and has an incredible personality, which I can't believe.

[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:32.440]
He's just too almost unreal, you know, that he takes all of this and it doesn't phase him.

[00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:33.680]
You know, he's just an easygoing guy.

[00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:35.080]
And he's a nice guy.

[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:35.940]
What does he swing?

[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:37.280]
Come on.

[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:38.340]
See, there you go again.

[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:38.760]
Just kidding.

[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:41.300]
You've got to stop with this, all right?

[00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:46.020]
In other words, I would love to have 20 friends just like Dave.

[00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:49.780]
Now maybe one of them, of course, you know, you always say that you've got 40 friends like me.

[00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:50.380]
No, I don't.

[00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:51.400]
I have no friends like Dave.

[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:55.240]
I'm not the only one who used to think that every guy I used to introduce her to, we were sleeping.

[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:56.380]
See, there you go.

[00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:56.880]
Of course.

[00:55:57.120 --> 00:56:00.840]
Every single, I mean, even straight guy, that our friends and minds still are.

[00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:05.320]
You know, they, she's think that, well, you know, what are you doing with this guy?

[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:05.960]
You know, be careful.

[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:06.760]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:08.580]
You know, be careful with all the disease.

[00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:08.920]
Right.

[00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:12.160]
And in the meantime, you probably weren't doing anything.

[00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:14.380]
No, no, as a matter of fact, as a matter of fact, it's not a matter of me.

[00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:17.560]
Very few that I even introduced the mob that I answered, even with.

[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:18.920]
And then right now is only one.

[00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:19.480]
Yeah.

[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:22.220]
But, you know, it just goes to show everybody things like that.

[00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:23.640]
If you're gay, you are.

[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:26.480]
Well, no, but even if you're anything, but especially gay, I guess.

[00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:29.740]
But anything, I mean, like Stan comes on, he does all this thing about trolling.

[00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:30.880]
And yeah, okay, he's desperate.

[00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:34.140]
But in the meantime, well, I shouldn't use him as an example.

[00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:35.500]
I think that was a bad example.

[00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:36.800]
True.

[00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:38.540]
But anyway, back to bowling.

[00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:39.340]
Okay.

[00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:40.040]
Come on.

[00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:41.360]
Come, come, bowl one by day.

[00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:42.640]
We've had Brian out there.

[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:44.280]
Alice has been there once.

[00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:45.340]
Brian.

[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:47.080]
Brian.

[00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:48.020]
Brian.

[00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:48.680]
Brian, North Carolina.

[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:50.800]
Oh my gosh.

[00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:52.280]
I'd love to have seen that.

[00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:53.780]
It was wonderful.

[00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:57.100]
I think you should do neighborhood weather from there, but that's at the point.

[00:56:57.600 --> 00:56:58.800]
And you had Alice out there?

[00:56:59.220 --> 00:56:59.500]
Alice.

[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:03.140]
Yeah, the very same Alice who was at the copa in this picture.

[00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:04.720]
What picture?

[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:10.280]
The one from the weekly news that I have here, the picture from the copa with these other two very amazing looking people.

[00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:11.460]
Oh, no, I missed that.

[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:12.920]
Yes, I have it right in my hand.

[00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:15.700]
And the Dave is rolling on the floor looking at it right now as I speak.

[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:17.240]
I have to run out and get that.

[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:20.240]
It's the September 16th issue of the weekly news.

[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:22.440]
Page 39 in the upper right hand corner.

[00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:24.140]
Oh, blow it up and send it somewhere.

[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:24.920]
I'll pass.

[00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:29.120]
So, you know, if you play the middle of the game, it's like a very name.

[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:29.980]
What?

[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:30.680]
You Monday night.

[00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:31.940]
I mean, it's at 9 o'clock.

[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:33.540]
You could come bowl one game.

[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:34.300]
Pick up a ball.

[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:35.320]
You still have your bowling ball?

[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.100]
You've got to be kidding me.

[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:37.940]
Why?

[00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:39.800]
I sold it.

[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:42.880]
OK, when I was unemployed, I sold my bowling ball and my bag.

[00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:44.120]
We have a houseball.

[00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:46.120]
We have houseball.

[00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:47.000]
I'll bet you did.

[00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:48.720]
I'll bet.

[00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:49.700]
Anything.

[00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:50.700]
I think it'd be interesting.

[00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:51.780]
You know, we all...

[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:52.760]
Well, I'll give it some thought.

[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:53.520]
No.

[00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:54.520]
You know where it's at?

[00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:55.460]
No.

[00:57:56.060 --> 00:57:56.340]
OK.

[00:57:57.260 --> 00:57:58.580]
Well, why don't you tell me that would be a concern?

[00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:01.980]
I don't know if I should say because you know, Monday night we'll have a hundred people show up to see what the boy...

[00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:03.100]
Wait! What's wrong with that?

[00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:03.800]
No, you're right.

[00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:04.580]
It's a bird bowl.

[00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:05.740]
Some of them might be good.

[00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:08.420]
At bird bowl Monday night, it's at nine o'clock.

[00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:10.680]
And it's a lot of fun.

[00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:12.440]
And you know, you don't have to be gay.

[00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:13.060]
I want to say that.

[00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:14.780]
You know, as a matter of fact, we have...

[00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:15.780]
Well, OK, I won't be.

[00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:17.400]
OK, that's what you want.

[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:18.020]
I won't be.

[00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:18.440]
I'll stop.

[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:19.760]
I'll just stop.

[00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:21.040]
It'll make a lot of people happy.

[00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:21.480]
Yeah.

[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:26.960]
But think about it and show up one Monday and give us a thrill.

[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:28.540]
OK, so to speak.

[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:29.540]
So to speak.

[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:30.300]
OK, see you later.

[00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:31.100]
I will win you ball.

[00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:31.760]
Thank you.

[00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:34.220]
Call 34 at WYNZ.

[00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:36.940]
We've had everything from bowling to incest today.

[00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:38.520]
And we're moving onward and upward.

[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:40.800]
Let's take a call from Broward.

[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:41.120]
You want to?

[00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:41.760]
Sure.

[00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:42.120]
Yeah.

[00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:43.940]
But you just agree, you see.

[00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:45.820]
I get nervous.

[00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:47.620]
No, I really do.

[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:49.500]
I get nervous when people are so agreeable to everything.

[00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:51.560]
Like, I have the feeling if I asked him seriously,

[00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:52.960]
would you like to...

[00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:53.940]
I can't say that on here.

[00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:55.140]
I mean, like anything.

[00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:55.760]
You just...

[00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:56.840]
Just...

[00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:58.020]
Have you always been like that?

[00:58:58.400 --> 00:58:59.560]
OK, we'll take one from day.

[00:58:59.820 --> 00:58:59.980]
Yeah.

[00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:02.820]
No, we're going to take it from Broward.

[00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:04.780]
I have to find a spot at which to, you know,

[00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:06.340]
take control back of the show.

[00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:08.360]
Broward County, speak to us.

[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:09.440]
Unbelievable.

[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:10.740]
I know it really is.

[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:12.000]
It's a good time.

[00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:12.880]
OK, go ahead.

[00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:13.760]
Hey, dude.

[00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:15.420]
What's happening, dude?

[00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:16.940]
What's happening with you?

[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:18.040]
Hey, Dave.

[00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:19.480]
Hey, how you doing?

[00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:20.480]
This is John.

[00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:21.420]
John?

[00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:22.220]
John.

[00:59:22.860 --> 00:59:22.860]

[00:59:22.860 --> 00:59:24.060]
From Springs.

[00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:25.680]
Oh.

[00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:26.980]
How you doing?

[00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:28.240]
Do I know you?

[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:31.560]
How does the Nelson plot Friday night?

[00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:32.280]
Oh.

[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:33.460]
I was looking at you.

[00:59:33.460 --> 00:59:36.300]
Yeah, I remember you, but I thought you were from Bo-Bointing.

[00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:37.300]
Boca.

[00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:38.140]
You're Boca.

[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:39.040]
I work out in Boca.

[00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:39.300]
Boca.

[00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:39.620]
Right.

[00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:40.360]
Same difference.

[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:41.460]
Boca, Bo-Bointing.

[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:43.920]
How you doing, John?

[00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:44.540]
You're good.

[00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:46.760]
Probably come back out Friday night.

[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:48.100]
If Neil's going to be out there, Neil.

[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:48.560]
I'll be there.

[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:49.200]
He'll be there.

[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:49.360]

[00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:49.900]
Definitely be there.

[00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:50.420]
What's the name?

[00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:53.300]
The bird will not be there, though, by the way.

[00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:54.940]
The bird.

[00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:56.780]
You know, speaking of the birds,

[00:59:57.420 --> 01:00:01.440]
when Dave ought to do it, get together and redo your brick oven commercial.

[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:05.820]
With Dave at one end, do it the other, but make an melting pot commercial.

[01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:07.160]
Hey, Neil, this is Dave.

[01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:08.120]
It's a melting pot.

[01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:08.480]
Yeah.

[01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:09.720]
That's what we have here.

[01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:10.360]
That sounds good.

[01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:13.560]
Well, if the melting pot wants to buy some advertising, that would be a good way to do it.

[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:14.360]
Okay.

[01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:15.700]
Hey, you know what else?

[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:15.980]
Two.

[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:16.880]
That girl shared.

[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.080]
Would you put this pot?

[01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:20.060]
She's part of your fore-day shake and one-eye.

[01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:21.460]
Do you have any desire to be in this business?

[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.200]
Excuse me for going on, but I'm just curious.

[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:24.820]
Do you have any desire to do any of this?

[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:25.920]
Why do you have any openings?

[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:28.320]
Oh, boy.

[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:30.140]
That was a terrible thing to say.

[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:31.880]
Can't you believe he asked me that question?

[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:33.400]
I'm sorry, sir.

[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:33.800]
Go ahead.

[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:36.060]
Dave just said something awful on the radio.

[01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:38.840]
Now, Neil, you've got a terrific program.

[01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:42.360]
I listened to you daily and got caught up.

[01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:45.420]
Sorry, today, when, so when you called me and said,

[01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:47.560]
David mentioned my name over the air.

[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.580]
And I'm kind of busy, so I won't tell you guys up.

[01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:53.360]
Neil, I've come by for a night.

[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:53.700]
What are you saying?

[01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:54.780]
You do.

[01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:56.380]
Sure, so you're going to be out there.

[01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:57.200]
We'll stop in Dave.

[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:01.060]
We'll make reservations today and see the both of you out there, I guess.

[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:02.760]
Well, let me ask you this question.

[01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:03.320]
Go ahead, Neil.

[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:04.900]
Because I'm always curious about this.

[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.460]
Like, all these people came by last night, and it was great.

[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:09.920]
I mean, they were, I can't begin to tell you what a positive,

[01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:11.280]
because they were all nice.

[01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:13.340]
I mean, each person was nicer than the other one.

[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:15.740]
Which means the first one may not have been all that great.

[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.560]
But by the time we got to the end, they were sensational.

[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:21.040]
But seriously, what is the deal?

[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:23.460]
Because I know there's one host, Mr. Ego, in town.

[01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:26.160]
I always used to come watch a seat, come watch a seat.

[01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:29.200]
Which I don't, I can't think of very many people.

[01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:32.540]
I would love to go watch Eat Dinner, sit around and watch the meat.

[01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:33.320]
What does that mean?

[01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:34.560]
The drawer is you.

[01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:37.140]
The drawer is you, Kyle, the bird, and...

[01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:38.160]
Well, Kyle's not going to be there.

[01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:41.820]
Okay, but not just that in general.

[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:43.500]
You guys, I hear you in the radio.

[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:46.640]
And the birds definitely not going to be there under penalty of death.

[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:47.740]
Hey, everybody, what are you doing?

[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:48.600]
Showing the floor.

[01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:49.100]
Yeah.

[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:52.920]
Dave, Dave should be in your chair today, and you should be down on the floor.

[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:54.120]
You do a great job.

[01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:54.840]
Oh, listen.

[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:57.640]
That we can get in a lot of trouble with that scenario.

[01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:59.000]
I can just see that now.

[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:02.960]
Okay, here about the style here about the radio.

[01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:06.300]
The features, the oversized, heavy set man.

[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:11.660]
The drawer is the easy go and talk on the radio.

[01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:12.080]
Yeah.

[01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:13.480]
The way things happen.

[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:16.920]
The gay rights or the...

[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:18.360]
Bicycle, whatever.

[01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:20.980]
Whatever, you know, be whatever you are, exactly.

[01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:22.800]
This is the drawer, the floor.

[01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:25.640]
And we're trying to find out what Dave is, but he won't tell us.

[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:28.860]
And then go right into the mung brain over the...

[01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:29.020]
Right.

[01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:31.300]
Boy, this guy is really just rambling along.

[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:32.720]
In the year, you're excellence, sir.

[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.020]
You're really out of sight.

[01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:35.120]
But here's the shaken.

[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:36.600]
You what?

[01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:38.120]
Like, like, here's...

[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:38.780]
Me too.

[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:39.640]
I'm sure.

[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:41.460]
Dave, he tried to get in a little closer.

[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:41.760]

[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:42.380]
I got a little closer.

[01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:43.720]
Any minute, go along the floor.

[01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:44.680]
And a half-kissed.

[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:47.680]
Okay, well, listen, sir, I think you've really done yourself quite a number here.

[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:50.680]
Okay, Neil, I'm going to swing by there and share it with you.

[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:54.200]
I'm going to swing your booth and perhaps I can take too many to your time and get in the booth with you all not.

[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:59.640]
Well, we don't want to all squeeze in there, you know, but we certainly would be delighted to say hello and, uh, whatever else.

[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:00.240]
Yeah.

[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:02.480]
And Dave, we'll see you out there, too.

[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:04.200]
Yeah, great, John. Thanks for calling.

[01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:04.760]
Okay.

[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:05.960]
See you, John. Take care.

[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.740]
In other words, that's Bob. Good bye, right?

[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:08.540]
Get rid of him.

[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:08.920]
Yeah.

[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:10.740]
Okay, let's take one from Dave next.

[01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:11.720]
We do have one open line.

[01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:12.840]
I should give these numbers out.

[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:15.320]
I never do any off-flange like that, because they just go nuts.

[01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:16.880]
And that's because you're here today.

[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:17.940]
They just...

[01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:19.800]
You don't believe that?

[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:20.280]
What?

[01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:21.940]
That the lines are going nuts here.

[01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:23.080]
Can't you see them? They're all flat.

[01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:24.920]
We got seven lines. They're all...

[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:25.220]
Of course.

[01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:26.760]
Is it bad?

[01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:29.660]
I don't know what all these buttons mean.

[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:30.540]
Look, look at the phone.

[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.300]
Can you see the lights flashing?

[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:34.060]
Yeah, I see a lot of empty ones.

[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:36.160]
No, those are not... Those are business lines.

[01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:37.620]
These are the calling lines here.

[01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:38.860]
I'll say you had open ones here.

[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.260]
Now, that's the, uh, bat line.

[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:42.260]
That's the inside line.

[01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:43.760]
All of these are the top lines.

[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:44.440]
Seven.

[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:45.520]
Seven, that's it.

[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:45.860]
Count them.

[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:47.040]
Are all seven of them in my line?

[01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:49.340]
Why is one not flashing?

[01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:51.160]
Because it's... That's the one that we're going to put on the ear.

[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:51.700]
Okay.

[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:52.980]
Any more questions?

[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:53.660]
That's it.

[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:54.280]
Okay.

[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:56.260]
I'm ready to take control.

[01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:58.920]
Do you want to sit down over here and I'll sit over there?

[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:00.440]
No, you're staying your spot.

[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:01.560]
Why?

[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:03.060]
It'll be a disaster.

[01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:04.940]
I mean, you have no idea what any of this is.

[01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:06.420]
But you come in here right away.

[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:07.720]
Oh, and you had two buttons there.

[01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:08.420]
You press them.

[01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:09.940]
Yeah, simple.

[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:11.360]
Even a moron could do this, right?

[01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:12.640]
Oh, okay.

[01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:13.020]
Hello.

[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:14.960]
He has left the room, but...

[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:15.180]
Hello.

[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:16.200]
Oh.

[01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:17.180]
Yes.

[01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:19.140]
I need your...

[01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:19.340]
Cloud.

[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:20.960]
The cloud that comes with your name.

[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:21.580]
Okay.

[01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:22.720]
You need to...

[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:23.540]
Will you do me a favor?

[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:24.980]
I'll do anything for you.

[01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:25.800]
Oh, thank you.

[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:29.140]
Would you call Grinnell Park and find out what's going on over there?

[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:29.720]
Why?

[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:37.380]
There is lots of movie, the star movers, and cameras, and people, and I'm dying to know who's over there,

[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:38.900]
and I called and they won't tell me.

[01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:40.600]
Maybe they're shooting vise over there.

[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:42.440]
Oh, and I stay had that last time.

[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:43.480]
We don't want to see that.

[01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:44.840]
Maybe it's someone important.

[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:46.700]
Maybe it's Jeff's striker.

[01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:48.020]
Oh, boy.

[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:50.020]
Ooh, couldn't you call and find out?

[01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:51.260]
Okay, I'll do that right now.

[01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:52.820]
Wait a minute.

[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:53.080]
Wait.

[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:53.800]
Yeah.

[01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:55.620]
No, that's not it.

[01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:56.540]
I think this...

[01:04:56.540 --> 01:04:58.960]
They shot vise there last year, and it wasn't as big as this.

[01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:00.280]
Ooh, don't wrinkle that up now.

[01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:00.760]
Oh, please.

[01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:02.200]
Oh, God.

[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:04.220]
Okay, I'll call right now and find out.

[01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:04.700]
Okay.

[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:05.260]
Thanks.

[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:16.680]
Okay, this could be something really exciting.

[01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:20.680]
It could be...

[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:21.460]
Un-

[01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:22.120]
Reliable.

[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:22.900]
Okay.

[01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:25.600]
Or, on the other hand, it could be...

[01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:27.160]
Total waste of time.

[01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:27.800]
Let's find out.

[01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:29.320]
Are you excited about this?

[01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:31.140]
May?

[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:31.520]
Yeah.

[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.820]
You know, looks like the excitable type.

[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:36.700]
You look very calm and laid back.

[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:42.420]
This is 9-76-JF.

[01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:44.820]
In just a moment, you and up to either of the colors

[01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:47.640]
will be connected blind with the incredible Jeff's driver.

[01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:51.400]
To talk to Jeff, call between 2 and 10 p.m. Monday through Friday.

[01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:53.600]
Or, on the other hand, meet other colors.

[01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:56.100]
Exchange numbers or just listen to it.

[01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:56.880]
Have fun.

[01:05:57.500 --> 01:05:57.760]
Yeah.

[01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:00.160]
I love that voice, don't you?

[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:00.580]
Yeah.

[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:02.660]
You could be on the sheet.

[01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:06.980]
Like in the morning, maybe.

[01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:11.580]
When they have that big opening, so to speak.

[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:16.280]
We're waiting with baited breath.

[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:20.080]
Are you getting nervous?

[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:20.980]
Or are you going to sleep?

[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:22.540]
What's going on here?

[01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:23.420]
We're waiting.

[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:25.680]
We're waiting for something to happen on the phone day.

[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:26.280]
Don't panic.

[01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:27.020]
We're waiting.

[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:27.720]
I'll get in the way.

[01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:28.380]
Okay.

[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:33.880]
Oh, yeah.

[01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:35.440]
Oh, yeah.

[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:38.560]
Oh, yeah.

[01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:40.380]
Yeah.

[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:41.840]
Yeah.

[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:44.400]
Unbelievable.

[01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:46.580]
Yeah.

[01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:49.740]
Okay.

[01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:52.780]
Well, listen, I think at that point we better interject.

[01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:53.900]
But that was pretty exciting.

[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.500]
Did you like it?

[01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:56.240]
Yeah, it was interesting.

[01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:59.160]
What are you going to voyeurism a little bit?

[01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:01.340]
I don't even know if that is.

[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:02.020]
You don't know what that means.

[01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:05.500]
In other words, watching people do certain things.

[01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:06.460]
Sure.

[01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:06.540]
Sure.

[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:08.700]
Yeah, that's going to be a stimulating right?

[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:09.280]
Right.

[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:09.920]
Okay.

[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:12.520]
Well, let's turn the lights out and Kyle can watch.

[01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:13.320]
Only a joke.

[01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:13.700]
Okay.

[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:15.300]
Let's go back to the phone.

[01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:15.660]
Hello.

[01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:17.240]
Hello.

[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.180]
Hello, speak to Neil, please.

[01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:19.960]
You got him, sir.

[01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:20.440]
How you doing?

[01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:21.360]
Oh, how you doing, Neil?

[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:22.100]
Real good.

[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:22.900]
You have no idea.

[01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:25.360]
Yeah, I think they're shooting police academy 5 out there.

[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:26.000]
Is that it?

[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:27.180]
Yeah, I believe that's what it is.

[01:07:27.180 --> 01:07:27.660]
Oh, boy.

[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:29.900]
Another great movie to South Florida's credit, boy.

[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:30.840]
We get all the biggies.

[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:31.540]
I hear that.

[01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:33.240]
I thought maybe it would be Porky's 9.

[01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:34.260]
Really?

[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:34.960]
Yeah.

[01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:36.760]
Hey, the cast, speak to Dave.

[01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:37.520]
You got him.

[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:38.360]
Yes, sir.

[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:40.080]
Yeah, Dave's, how you doing?

[01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:40.720]
Nothing bad.

[01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:42.380]
Got some real nice looking waitresses.

[01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:43.300]
We do?

[01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:44.660]
There you go.

[01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:46.680]
Oh, there's Chrissy, of course.

[01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:47.640]
Oh, okay.

[01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:48.600]
And we got Lisa.

[01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:49.460]
Yeah.

[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:51.220]
Well, that's great.

[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:51.520]
That's about it.

[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:55.020]
I've got to be better than some of the women I saw down at the ice cream place.

[01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:55.640]
Oh, come on.

[01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:57.900]
Now, there were some really attractive people there last night.

[01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:01.180]
There were few, you know, I mean, not everybody can be fantastic.

[01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:02.600]
Not everybody can look like Michelle.

[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:04.600]
Oh, Michelle was a guy.

[01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:06.320]
She was fine.

[01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:06.820]
You bet.

[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:07.900]
I'm in love with her.

[01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:10.660]
In fact, I was almost considering making the big switch.

[01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:12.640]
Oh, well, you better watch that now.

[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:13.200]
Yeah, I know.

[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:14.780]
I may get that operation, sir.

[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:16.300]
Well, listen to you.

[01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:18.140]
Okay, I'm good one.

[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:18.560]
Okay.

[01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:19.180]
That's you later.

[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:20.600]
There we go with a horny old man.

[01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:25.340]
Okay, let's take one from Dave County just because we love our friends and Dave.

[01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:25.680]
Hello.

[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:27.660]
See what I mean?

[01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:31.060]
We love them, but they hate us.

[01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:32.540]
That's the way it's been all my life.

[01:08:33.580 --> 01:08:34.700]
Let's try another one, Carl.

[01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:35.280]
There's nobody there.

[01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:37.100]
Hello.

[01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:37.920]
Hello.

[01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:38.520]
Yeah.

[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:39.800]
Dale.

[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:40.560]
Yes, sir.

[01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:41.400]
How's it going?

[01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:42.500]
Okay, wake up.

[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:43.360]
Pal, come on.

[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:47.040]
Well, you know, the film's only been written here for like a 45 minutes.

[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:47.700]
Wow, that's okay.

[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:48.480]
Keep you out of trouble.

[01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:48.920]
Yes, sir.

[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:49.780]
Yeah, dude.

[01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:51.520]
I think you got problems with the birds.

[01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:56.500]
I think you're bringing these young attractive guys on the show.

[01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:58.300]
You know, he's getting a little wild.

[01:08:58.340 --> 01:08:59.580]
Yeah, he got, he couldn't handle it.

[01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:03.720]
I mean, Paul yesterday he was nervous about, but when Dave came in today, he just crumbled.

[01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:04.580]
He couldn't handle this.

[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:06.140]
Listen, does he got along here?

[01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:07.100]
The bird?

[01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:07.580]
Yeah.

[01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:08.660]
Minimal.

[01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:09.840]
Minimal here.

[01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:11.460]

[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:14.880]
Like he's got about as much hair as you'll Brenner did, may he rest in peace?

[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:16.280]
Huh?

[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:18.360]
Have you ever seen Tully Sivalas, sir?

[01:09:18.540 --> 01:09:19.700]
It's straight, though, right?

[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:22.100]
We don't, we have no idea.

[01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:23.720]
He flies a rather crooked path.

[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:25.460]
Yeah, so we have no idea.

[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:26.260]
It's bizarre.

[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:28.300]
You know, you talk about...

[01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:29.580]
What difference does it make?

[01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:30.740]
In his case, especially.

[01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.400]
Well, a lot of difference.

[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:34.640]
We need like to know?

[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:35.200]
No.

[01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:37.560]
Not in the least, have no interest.

[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:39.400]
No interest, sir.

[01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:40.700]
Did all?

[01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:41.440]
No.

[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:43.560]
All right, so what else is going on?

[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:45.060]
I hear Dave's on the line.

[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:45.940]
Dave is here.

[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:47.400]
What do you mean what else is going on?

[01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:48.720]
Oh, I want to know what's happening.

[01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:49.860]
You know, I call you every day.

[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:51.720]
You call us every day?

[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:52.480]
Every day.

[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:53.380]
Yeah, I don't get through that.

[01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:53.880]
Oh, I see.

[01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:57.100]
It isn't the phone ring, like, you know, 50, 60 times.

[01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:57.720]
Yeah.

[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:00.340]
Well, it was a full and rich life.

[01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:02.120]
Just say what?

[01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:03.640]
A full and rich life?

[01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:03.920]
Yeah.

[01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:05.220]
No, I know.

[01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:06.620]
You're just loyal and devoted, right?

[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:07.000]
Yeah.

[01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:07.540]

[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:09.480]
I got it, and then when nobody else was.

[01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:10.120]
I know.

[01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:10.440]
Yeah.

[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:12.140]
When we really needed you, you were there.

[01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:14.580]
Neal.

[01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:15.000]
Yeah.

[01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:16.720]
What do you think of this football strike?

[01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:17.420]
I'm delighted.

[01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:18.580]
I'm so happy about it.

[01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:19.260]
You have no idea.

[01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:19.400]
Yeah.

[01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:20.420]
Baseball.

[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:22.380]
Baseball play officer coming up now.

[01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:23.620]
The twins have clenched.

[01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:24.140]
Yeah.

[01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:25.040]
And the giants.

[01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:29.880]
It's going to be great because you've got Toronto and Minnesota and San Francisco and

[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:30.280]
Cardinals.

[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:31.580]
You've got three out of the four teams.

[01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:33.580]
Our teams that usually are not in it, okay?

[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:34.460]
Which is great.

[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:36.560]
David, who's talking about my...

[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:37.340]
Are you a baseball fan?

[01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:38.340]
Yeah, I'm not.

[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:38.920]
Okay.

[01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:42.360]
So in other words, you're not going to be impressed by my deal Murphy plaque that somebody

[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:43.360]
brought over last night.

[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:44.420]
Oh, I am impressed.

[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:44.880]
Yeah.

[01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:45.860]
Yeah, it's impressive.

[01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:47.740]
You'd be impressed too if you looked like deal Murphy.

[01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:49.380]
But go ahead, sir.

[01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:49.840]
I'm sorry.

[01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:50.300]
Okay.

[01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:51.840]
You know, I don't mind hanging out there.

[01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:53.980]
As soon as I said that, he dropped the plaque.

[01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:55.960]
But other people took his hands off and dropped it.

[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:56.920]
Go ahead.

[01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:00.980]
Your friend Steve, Steve did on this station?

[01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:02.500]
Well, Mr. Ego, yeah.

[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:03.040]
What about him?

[01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:04.540]
But a moron.

[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:05.480]
Oh, come on.

[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:06.460]
Oh, my God.

[01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:09.420]
I mean, it may be true, but let's not, you know, not for us to say that.

[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:09.980]
That's okay.

[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:12.860]
He is embarrassing himself.

[01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:13.660]
I mean...

[01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:14.320]
Yeah.

[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:17.360]
I heard that he's doing something about, let's support the scabs or something.

[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:19.420]
And, yeah, let me tell you something, all right?

[01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:25.540]
He tells you that there's none of our business how much money they make and all this kind

[01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:25.980]
of stuff.

[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:32.080]
Unless, not getting a personal life, and then he brings up Lori and the three quintelists.

[01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:32.880]
Oh, yeah.

[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:35.160]
And he goes on and on and on.

[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:37.160]
And he called Lori the other day.

[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:38.060]
They were talking about...

[01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:38.900]
What did he call her?

[01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:39.740]
Sure.

[01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:41.740]
Well, not as much as we did.

[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:46.520]
But listen, what he did was he called it because he had a...

[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:52.520]
He had a person on the show that was talking about being a showman as pig, and he called

[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:55.120]
his wife and says, am I a showman as pig?

[01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:56.240]
And he says, yes, you are.

[01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.860]
And do you know the day wasted?

[01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:00.260]
It was a waste.

[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:02.040]
I mean, it was a good call.

[01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:06.140]
But they wasted like 30 minutes of money, air time.

[01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:09.520]
Yeah, like we're wasting all this money, I'm not sure how I'm talking about it.

[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:10.180]
We'd be different.

[01:12:10.420 --> 01:12:11.940]
You're getting paid to hear me talk.

[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:12.840]
Oh, no.

[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:15.260]
What, but they pay me by the minute now?

[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:15.980]
That sounds good.

[01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:19.120]
What he says, what?

[01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:21.400]
He came on and said that he makes a high risk.

[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:22.180]
That wasn't right.

[01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:23.820]
200.

[01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:24.720]
Huh?

[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:25.600]
He makes 200.

[01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:32.420]
Oh, he says, you know, I worked 45 years to make $100,000 to get to 100,000.

[01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:33.620]
Well, now he's making two, sir.

[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:34.180]
Trust me.

[01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:35.940]
I don't give a damn if he makes...

[01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:40.340]
No, I don't, for my party can make five because if he makes one or he makes five or 20,000,

[01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:40.880]
he still sucks.

[01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:41.460]
You know what I mean?

[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:43.900]
I'm just gonna have a one, listen, have a great day.

[01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:46.340]
I gotta take this break now or Kyle's gonna get real nervous.

[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:47.000]
Take it.

[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:47.320]
One?

[01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:48.160]
Take a break.

[01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:48.840]
Okay.

[01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:50.520]
Right, I'll read the dirge.

[01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:51.960]
There he goes.

[01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:54.460]
12 minutes, did he sound a little surly at the end of the...

[01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:54.920]
Are you leaving?

[01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:56.520]
Now, where are you going?

[01:12:56.940 --> 01:12:57.920]
I'm here.

[01:12:58.680 --> 01:12:58.680]

[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:02.480]
Look like you were about to spring up and everybody's like leaving today, you know what I'm saying?

[01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:04.440]
If I, did I use my right guard today?

[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:05.080]
I thought so.

[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:09.740]
I mean, I left the house rather freely, but did I do something wrong?

[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:11.620]
Now, do I need to apologize?

[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:12.640]
No.

[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:13.460]
Have we offended you?

[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:13.880]
Nope.

[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:14.920]
Do I offend the bird?

[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:15.700]
Yes.

[01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:16.300]
Yeah.

[01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:21.300]
Can you do that?

[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:22.180]
Can we give a sigh?

[01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:23.440]
Ah.

[01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:26.140]
Boy, Bob Lasseter.

[01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:27.280]
Hang your head in the shade.

[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:29.280]
Ten minutes.

[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:30.140]
Put your clothes back.

[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:30.760]
I want you to please.

[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:32.180]
Ten minutes before one.

[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:32.760]
No, seriously.

[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:35.340]
He's getting up to take his clothes off.

[01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:36.260]
This ought to be very exciting.

[01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:38.740]
I think we discovered something here today.

[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:41.000]
Were you gonna let me have one of those or not?

[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.880]
I don't want to take your last cigarette.

[01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:44.500]
I don't smoke.

[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:46.560]
And I don't want to encourage anybody to smoke.

[01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:49.800]
But I figured if I do everything that Dave does, we're gonna weak.

[01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:52.520]
I'll look just like he does, and then there'll be no more problem now.

[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:53.920]
I notice he's not...

[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:54.840]
Look at this!

[01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:55.520]
Oh.

[01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:57.840]
Oh my god.

[01:13:58.100 --> 01:13:58.100]

[01:13:58.100 --> 01:13:59.460]
Are you cereal or what?

[01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:03.860]
Holy Toledo brick oven pizza is just brought in the whole store.

[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:05.120]
What do you guys do?

[01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:06.860]
You're closing up for a couple of weeks or what?

[01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:07.800]
Nine pies.

[01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:10.180]
Boy, oh boy.

[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.740]
Do we take care of you or what Dave?

[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:13.820]
I don't believe it.

[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:13.940]
What?

[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:16.720]
What probably if you take the...

[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:18.560]
You don't have to be bashful in here.

[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:19.320]
Just take over.

[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:20.380]
Everybody else does.

[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:22.620]
Just start digging in.

[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:23.760]
No drinks with this.

[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:25.820]
Come on Dave.

[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:27.180]
It wouldn't buy all the drinks you want.

[01:14:27.260 --> 01:14:27.520]
Relax.

[01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:28.460]
Relax.

[01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:29.420]
Look at all this stuff.

[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:31.180]
What are we gonna do with the Chinese army?

[01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:35.660]
Well, we want first, and then we'll let the rest of the people come in.

[01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:36.660]
Okay?

[01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:37.820]
Those are garlic slices.

[01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:38.820]
Those are fantastic.

[01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:39.420]
I believe it.

[01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:39.800]
Yeah.

[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:40.740]
Never had one of them.

[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:41.980]
Everything's marked.

[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:46.480]
Okay, let's take a call while our guest is going through an attack of gluttony.

[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:47.500]
Thank you very much.

[01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:50.340]
That was beyond my wildest expectations.

[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:52.860]
See, do we take care of you or what?

[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:53.520]
We've got to tip them.

[01:14:54.540 --> 01:14:55.840]
They don't want to be tipped.

[01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:57.040]
What do you think this is?

[01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:57.880]
The melting pot?

[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:00.840]
All right.

[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:02.900]
Broward.

[01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:04.440]
Hello.

[01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:05.940]
Move them.

[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:07.440]
How you doing now?

[01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:07.980]
Okay.

[01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:08.080]
Okay.

[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:10.000]
I've got a phone number for you.

[01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:12.980]
If we got food here, boy, we should share it with the audience.

[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:15.360]
1-900-660-Hoke.

[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:17.300]
Jim and Tammy Bakers, New Phone Noises.

[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:17.840]
Oh, is that it?

[01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:19.080]
1-900-Hoke.

[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:19.860]
660-Hoke.

[01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:21.000]
Oh, I love that one.

[01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:21.940]
2-000 phone calls.

[01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:22.700]
Oh, we don't care.

[01:15:22.820 --> 01:15:23.220]
We got luck.

[01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:24.280]
This show is loaded.

[01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:25.040]
I know.

[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:27.320]
I mean, Money Magazine, Golf Digest.

[01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:28.580]
We're loaded on this show, you know?

[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:29.940]
How's the pizza?

[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:31.340]
We haven't touched it yet.

[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:33.400]
What's this garlic slice when it sounds pretty good?

[01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:33.760]
Oh, yeah.

[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:34.380]
Those are great.

[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:36.700]
It's like a pizza, but it's in slices.

[01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:37.480]
It's got garlic.

[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:38.480]
Thank you so much.

[01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:39.020]
That was good.

[01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:41.320]
I just want to let you know that phone number.

[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:42.620]
That's all.

[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:43.380]
That's all I was going to call.

[01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:44.080]
Thanks a lot.

[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:44.560]
Thank you.

[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:46.320]
Hi, Viva Dirge.

[01:15:46.820 --> 01:15:47.400]
1-4-3.

[01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:47.600]
Hi.

[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:52.040]
Great.

[01:15:54.180 --> 01:15:55.980]
I feel like I'm back in college again.

[01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:56.420]
I'm smoking.

[01:15:56.580 --> 01:15:57.500]
I just smoke new ports.

[01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:59.000]
Three packs a day.

[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:00.860]
Now you stick this guys?

[01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:01.760]
Yeah, now I smoke.

[01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:02.520]
I'll go cancer sticks.

[01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:02.920]
Big ones.

[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:03.800]
Okay.

[01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:05.160]
Let's take another call from Dave.

[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:05.800]
What do you say?

[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:06.340]
Sounds good.

[01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:07.000]
Sounds good.

[01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:07.300]
Sure.

[01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:07.620]
Hello.

[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:08.480]
Hey, how you doing?

[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:08.900]
Good.

[01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:09.400]
What's up?

[01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:11.160]
What's up, dude?

[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:12.960]
Dave, it's Paul.

[01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:14.100]
How you doing?

[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:16.380]
Down in Miami and running the melting pot down here.

[01:16:16.700 --> 01:16:16.880]
Wow.

[01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:18.580]
You got all your friends calling in here.

[01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:18.820]
Hi, Dave.

[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:20.900]
So, is this the one down in Kendall?

[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:22.580]
This is the one down in Kendall, yes.

[01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:25.500]
And what I wanted to know, Neil, is you're making reservations.

[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:27.980]
My manager called me and a lot of people are calling in.

[01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:30.320]
And I wanted to know how many people are going to be on your table.

[01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:32.940]
On my table or at my table?

[01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:33.840]
No, it's plain.

[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:35.020]
We have two different sides table.

[01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:38.820]
There will only be one person on the table and he's sitting to my right right at the moment.

[01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:39.940]
He'll be on the table.

[01:16:39.980 --> 01:16:41.840]
He'll be centered directly in the middle.

[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:43.760]
I've covered with chalk with fondue.

[01:16:44.260 --> 01:16:45.700]
You told them about that, huh, Dave?

[01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:46.100]
Yes.

[01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:47.820]
That's only for special customers.

[01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:48.780]
Only for me.

[01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:49.360]
Trust me.

[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:51.760]
I'd pay serious money.

[01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:52.840]
But anyway.

[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:55.420]
Guys, we're trying it.

[01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:55.580]
We're trying it.

[01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:57.720]
I mean, I have gold card, green card.

[01:16:58.040 --> 01:16:59.880]
I even have an immigration green card.

[01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:01.520]
So, anything you like.

[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:02.220]
I heard about that.

[01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:08.040]
But, I guess they're going to be four of us because Stan and I and Sharon is bringing one of her illicit relatives or something.

[01:17:08.180 --> 01:17:08.400]
I don't know.

[01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:09.160]
So, I guess four.

[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:10.540]
Lucid or lucid?

[01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:11.260]
Lucid.

[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:12.620]
Lucid relative.

[01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:13.620]
Yeah, elusive.

[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:15.240]
And lucid, okay.

[01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:16.500]
So, there'll be four of you, total.

[01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:18.560]
And one person centered in the middle.

[01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:19.760]
Yeah.

[01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:20.780]
And we got it now.

[01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:21.820]
You think you can hold them down?

[01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:23.160]
I need to clarify that.

[01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:24.660]
How many guys does it take to hold him down?

[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:28.400]
Although, I guess we can find that out during CBS News.

[01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:32.640]
Says the joke.

[01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:33.540]
It's just a joke.

[01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:34.540]
It's just a joke.

[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:35.300]
No, I'm serious.

[01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:36.820]
Do you know how long have you known Dave?

[01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:38.220]
Well, I've known Dave actually.

[01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:39.840]
My name's Paul on the owner of the melting pot.

[01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:40.280]
Yeah, we know.

[01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:43.520]
Dave started building with it.

[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:44.340]
He started what?

[01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:45.860]
He built the...

[01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:46.960]
Yeah, that's what he told me, yeah.

[01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:49.840]
Yeah, he started, he walked in one day and I go, oh boy.

[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:51.800]
But, I mean, you said, oh boy?

[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:52.820]
He didn't look so good.

[01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:54.440]
What do you mean?

[01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:55.080]
He made a game of job.

[01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:57.260]
Well, what happened to him all of a sudden?

[01:17:57.260 --> 01:17:58.220]
It looks pretty good now.

[01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:00.780]
He became a master's stain technician is what it was.

[01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:02.220]
Well, we don't want to...

[01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:03.660]
Listen, I mean, it's a family show.

[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:05.240]
Oh, no, stain technician.

[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:06.320]
He stained all the wood.

[01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:07.060]
Oh, I see.

[01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:09.700]
Well, even then, I'm not so sure we can talk about it.

[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:10.900]
It could be actionable, you know what I mean?

[01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:11.840]
I understand.

[01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:12.400]
I understand.

[01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:14.640]
And Dave's been with us about a year now.

[01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:15.460]
A year and a half, I guess.

[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:16.200]
But I mean, he's...

[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:17.280]
He always had this...

[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:21.500]
Like, kind of disposition, because I find it very bizarre for people to be just so like...

[01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:22.840]
Nothing seems to phase him.

[01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:24.140]
He's very lethargic, yes.

[01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:25.600]
No, I didn't say lethargy.

[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:26.180]
Come on, Paul.

[01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:28.740]
See, you're just using that as an excuse to underpay him.

[01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:31.940]
I think you own the big raise personally.

[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:34.060]
I mean, it's thus went off my back, yeah.

[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:35.220]
He's very kick back, yeah.

[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:35.920]
But he's good.

[01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:36.980]
He's got a real good person out.

[01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:37.980]
Yeah, he does.

[01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:39.240]
He gets a lottery question.

[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:42.540]
How do a person you just like to fold up, put in your trunk and take home for a few days?

[01:18:42.620 --> 01:18:44.820]
You know, and just sit there and laugh, you know.

[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:46.340]
Am I right?

[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:46.920]
Exactly.

[01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:48.360]
You see, I've got him paid perfectly.

[01:18:48.460 --> 01:18:51.160]
He's just a Mr. Goodtime Charlie, you know?

[01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:52.920]
That's Dave.

[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:55.200]
That's something about that's correct.

[01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:57.420]
Yeah, see, I'm a very good judge of character.

[01:18:58.520 --> 01:18:59.740]
And what's on the outside?

[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:01.820]
It doesn't always tell you what's on the inside, right?

[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:02.800]
Direct two.

[01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:04.100]
Yeah, some people put on a facade.

[01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:04.840]
That's right.

[01:19:05.180 --> 01:19:05.740]
And we know what that is.

[01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:06.640]
But this is the real thing.

[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:07.100]
Exactly.

[01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:07.920]
No, that's the real.

[01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:08.900]
You got the real Dave right there.

[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:09.480]
Absolutely.

[01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:10.800]
What you see is what you get.

[01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:12.260]
And the cigarette is right hand, right?

[01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:14.260]
Yes, he does right now, as we speak.

[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:14.720]
Who Dave?

[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:18.380]
I won't tell you what he's got in his left hand, but it's a family show, Paul.

[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:19.060]
I understand.

[01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:20.640]
So listen, this better...

[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:22.860]
I'm sure this is going to be great because we've had ray of reviews

[01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:24.280]
and everybody has said it's sensation.

[01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:28.300]
And I get another hostel letter from the people at P. August because, you know...

[01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:32.660]
I mean, I would have gotten up there eventually, but it's just, you know, life doesn't work.

[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:38.380]
If I were there, if they would hire some Foxy help up there, I would work there immediately, you know.

[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:39.080]
I understand.

[01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:43.800]
If these people would just find out where my team might change their mind about me, after you see Paul, I don't know.

[01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:44.580]
Really?

[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:45.020]
Yes.

[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:46.200]
Why is that?

[01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:47.780]
He's a good-looking man.

[01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:48.620]
How old is he?

[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:49.360]
He's your boss.

[01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:51.600]
He's about 25, 26.

[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:52.060]
Really?

[01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:52.500]
Yeah.

[01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:55.040]
I'm 25 years old.

[01:19:55.140 --> 01:19:55.700]
I'm a hard work.

[01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:56.980]
I'm dedicated to fondue.

[01:19:57.380 --> 01:19:57.980]
And you're the boss?

[01:19:58.300 --> 01:19:59.100]
I'm the boss, man.

[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:00.800]
It's a young company.

[01:20:01.020 --> 01:20:01.760]
It's a young company.

[01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:02.500]
What does he do?

[01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:05.280]
Does he force you to do a lot of tacky things up there or what?

[01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:06.320]
I mean, that you can talk about?

[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:09.320]
Basically, you run a real relaxed crew, right?

[01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:10.420]
Well, that's what we got.

[01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:11.980]
Yeah, you really do.

[01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:13.440]
I can't get over it.

[01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:20.820]
Maybe that's probably why the bird left the room because he couldn't cope with all this goings on here with somebody who was so...

[01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:22.800]
At home, he just seems to fit in here like a glove.

[01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:24.540]
So to speak.

[01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:25.720]
Fits in everywhere, you know?

[01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:25.940]

[01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:29.260]
I don't think he's ever been put in a situation he feels uncomfortable.

[01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:29.740]
I have to do that.

[01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:32.520]
Yeah, it's a matter of fact, last night.

[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:33.980]
Why, what happened?

[01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:35.020]
Anything we can talk about?

[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:37.760]
Now, really?

[01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:39.120]
Oh, you meant the ice cream place?

[01:20:40.140 --> 01:20:41.400]
I don't know what time it got off work.

[01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:42.120]
I was down on my hand.

[01:20:42.140 --> 01:20:43.120]
Did you go to the ice cream place?

[01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:44.420]
No, I couldn't.

[01:20:44.460 --> 01:20:45.380]
So what did he talk about?

[01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:45.940]
I don't know.

[01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:48.220]
I guess it's something we'll have to discuss during the news break, right?

[01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:48.600]
Yeah.

[01:20:48.820 --> 01:20:49.060]
Okay.

[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:51.240]
All right, then, guys.

[01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:52.560]
You guys doing a great job.

[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:53.540]
Thank you.

[01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:53.800]
Of what?

[01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:56.060]
A promoting fondue?

[01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:57.300]
Yeah, you bet, man.

[01:20:57.440 --> 01:20:58.020]
I'm telling you what.

[01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:00.200]
You'd better be great because, you know?

[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:00.860]
Oh, it is.

[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:02.380]
I'm not even worried about that.

[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:04.300]
As long as you get david away, then nothing can go wrong.

[01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:05.660]
Well, that sounds good to me.

[01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:07.120]
Okay, Paul.

[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:08.480]
Well, listen, you're going to be there, right?

[01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:09.260]
Oh, yeah, I'll be there.

[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:09.840]
Oh, boy.

[01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:10.940]
I'm always there Friday, sir.

[01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:12.940]
Well, maybe you can hold him down on the table for us.

[01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:14.900]
Well, we have special clamps that are underneath.

[01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:15.540]
Okay.

[01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:16.860]
See you Friday.

[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:17.180]
Okay.

[01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:17.780]
Bye-bye.

[01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:18.400]
Okay.

[01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:21.460]
Well, listen, we're going to eat now, and you tell me a couple of those little stories.

[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:24.140]
Now, when we come back, we'll take some more calls, and we're just...

[01:21:24.140 --> 01:21:26.160]
You know, we're all the hungry people in the building came from.

[01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:27.000]
Right away.

[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:28.700]
From Zeta, from all the way to the building.

[01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:29.040]
Okay.

[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:31.840]
Well, listen, they have good reason to be hungry, but that's another story.

[01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:33.440]
Just kidding, Peter.

[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:34.120]
Just a joke.

[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:35.220]
It's just a joke.

[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:35.940]
No problem.

[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:39.620]
But we, again, want to thank Ray because he's feeding the starving here.

[01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:41.240]
He's just doing a fantastic job.

[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:47.160]
And your wildest dreams, when you came here, did you ever believe that you'd just...

[01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:52.400]
You would be seen in front of you that you would be treated like a king or close to it.

[01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:52.860]
Okay.

[01:21:52.980 --> 01:21:56.820]
Let's take some more calls here because the phones seem to be just foaming at the mouth, don't they?

[01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:57.580]
The callers?

[01:21:58.440 --> 01:21:58.800]
Okay.

[01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:01.560]
Probably the callers are for Dave and not for me anymore because they forget.

[01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:03.100]
Hello.

[01:22:04.540 --> 01:22:04.900]
Hello.

[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:06.280]
Hello.

[01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:06.320]
Hello.

[01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:06.840]
Hello.

[01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:07.080]
Yes, sir.

[01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:08.100]
Hello.

[01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:08.780]
Oh, that's me.

[01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:10.080]
Yes, sir.

[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:10.600]
Hi, Nea.

[01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:11.080]
How are you doing?

[01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:12.000]
That's me.

[01:22:12.620 --> 01:22:13.220]
Yes, sir.

[01:22:13.420 --> 01:22:13.820]
Hi, Nea.

[01:22:13.820 --> 01:22:14.920]
Oh, pretty good.

[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:16.320]
Okay, let's...

[01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:18.740]
We could do that one day.

[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:19.640]
We could do the time tunnel.

[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:20.580]
I'll just talk to myself.

[01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:23.160]
I'll interview myself a lot better than most of the more I'd said.

[01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:23.600]
All right.

[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:25.200]
Okay, let's try another one.

[01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:25.420]
Hello.

[01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:28.300]
Is this going to go on the whole hour?

[01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:29.760]
I don't know.

[01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:30.500]
Hello.

[01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:33.240]
I don't think they want to talk to you.

[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:34.760]
All right.

[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:35.200]
One more.

[01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:36.200]
And then that's it.

[01:22:36.340 --> 01:22:37.100]
Then we'll just go to music.

[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:38.060]
We'll change the format.

[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:39.200]
We'll go to music.

[01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:39.680]
Hello.

[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:40.520]
Hello, Nea.

[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:41.040]
Oh, boy.

[01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:42.020]
You saved the show, sir.

[01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:43.580]
I bet that's the story of my life.

[01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:45.920]
You must listen to me very closely at a much time, too.

[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:46.180]
Okay.

[01:22:46.220 --> 01:22:47.580]
I'm listening very closely.

[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:48.920]
You know, Jamie and Marcy.

[01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:49.600]
Yeah.

[01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:50.700]
That didn't last night.

[01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:51.720]
They were there last night.

[01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:54.560]
My brother, if he knew I was listening, I'd be in grave danger.

[01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:54.960]
Why?

[01:22:55.460 --> 01:22:58.680]
Well, all over the country, Neal, and this has been going on for several years.

[01:22:59.000 --> 01:22:59.820]
He doesn't know I'm calling.

[01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:03.480]
They wore unsuspecting talk show hosts to their home for dinner.

[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:06.160]
And they're never heard nor seen from again.

[01:23:08.260 --> 01:23:09.180]
Who said, Neal?

[01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:13.940]
It's been said that they forced fees in a large kosher-dill pickle until they're busting

[01:23:13.940 --> 01:23:14.460]
at the gut.

[01:23:15.140 --> 01:23:15.960]
And it's sad.

[01:23:16.140 --> 01:23:16.680]
It's scary.

[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:17.700]
I don't know what to do.

[01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:18.380]
I feel evil.

[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:18.860]
Yeah.

[01:23:19.100 --> 01:23:19.820]
I had to warn you.

[01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:20.600]
I had to let you know.

[01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:27.540]
Well, you may have to save a couple of desperate talk hosts, or you do realize that, don't you?

[01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:30.700]
They took your picture last night, and I saw it.

[01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:30.960]
They blot.

[01:23:31.020 --> 01:23:31.820]
We're over in our pants, huh?

[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:32.240]
Eating dinner.

[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:34.400]
I just want to straighten out of one thing, though.

[01:23:34.900 --> 01:23:37.480]
There were no people at the sterilized night with giant pickles.

[01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:40.080]
They keep them in their house in jars.

[01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:41.600]
They're stuck piled.

[01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:42.800]
Publits is all out of them.

[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:43.440]
Go to Publits.

[01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:44.100]
Go to Albertson.

[01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:45.940]
See if you can find large kosher-dill pickles.

[01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:49.180]
Yeah, I found some large dill pickles at Windixi.

[01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:51.300]
I don't want to touch that.

[01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:52.240]
Okay, please.

[01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:53.760]
I have a question for you, though.

[01:23:54.260 --> 01:23:55.220]
This is the serious question.

[01:23:55.340 --> 01:23:56.980]
Okay, let's clean it up here a little bit.

[01:23:57.420 --> 01:23:57.600]
Yes.

[01:23:57.820 --> 01:23:59.160]
They may be on the listen line in Portland.

[01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:00.260]
You know, they give you very uptight.

[01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:04.440]
I was talking to Stan a few weeks ago, and it went pretty well.

[01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:07.760]
But at the end, I mentioned the radio stage, which I'm not going to do.

[01:24:07.820 --> 01:24:09.060]
Another radio station in Chicago.

[01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:11.460]
And I wanted to tell a joke, which I have heard off of there.

[01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:12.300]
And I guess I...

[01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:12.640]
Which one?

[01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:13.140]
WLS?

[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:14.000]
No.

[01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:15.740]
I don't know.

[01:24:15.780 --> 01:24:15.780]

[01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:17.140]
You probably cut me off.

[01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:17.820]
No, I won't.

[01:24:17.860 --> 01:24:19.920]
Why would I cut you off, Virginia, in Chicago?

[01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:22.840]
Okay, well, you all do it, and you'll cut me off.

[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:23.260]
The loop.

[01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:24.700]
So what's wrong with the loop?

[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:25.280]
How do you think?

[01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:27.180]
I was going to mention the joke I heard.

[01:24:27.380 --> 01:24:28.540]
I'm actually kind of operating on it.

[01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:29.660]
I can't do it.

[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:30.780]
Go ahead.

[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:31.960]
Well, it's a bad weather joke.

[01:24:32.060 --> 01:24:32.460]
It's terrible.

[01:24:32.460 --> 01:24:33.760]
You know, it's a thing...

[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:36.280]
Well, what do you do when it's running cats and dogs?

[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:37.520]
You know, don't step on a poodle.

[01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:41.120]
But I mean, it would like the ultimate bad joke at the end of a pretty...

[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:43.320]
I'm telling you, that Chicago radio man is so good.

[01:24:44.260 --> 01:24:46.820]
And it puts that dams thinking how it's stirring the shing.

[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:47.320]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:50.100]
Well, I'm an airline pilot, so when I'm up there, I listen to it.

[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:50.900]
Yeah, the figures.

[01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:52.460]
You know what we're having all these problems.

[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:53.080]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:54.320]
You'll land it.

[01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:55.680]
You'll land it the right runway.

[01:24:56.540 --> 01:24:57.620]
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

[01:24:57.780 --> 01:24:58.480]
It's scary, actually.

[01:24:58.500 --> 01:24:58.620]
Yeah.

[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:00.200]
But...

[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:01.440]
Like that flight, I took the Pittsburgh.

[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:03.840]
When you landed it all here, I got a little nervous, you know what I mean?

[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:05.100]
I tried new in there.

[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:06.320]
You were on there, you know?

[01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:06.400]
Yeah.

[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:08.980]
Oh, but really, I don't work for that airline.

[01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:09.920]
What do you think about that?

[01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:11.520]
That just went on down here with the...

[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:13.480]
At gate C8 down there, it's my Amir port.

[01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:13.740]
Where's that?

[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:15.200]
I don't get involved in all these controversially.

[01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:17.180]
We keep the show very laid back.

[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:19.640]
I have no opinions about anything, sir.

[01:25:20.100 --> 01:25:20.460]
That's cool.

[01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:21.940]
I've got a 180 degree turn.

[01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:23.700]
I used to be an opinionated son of a bitch.

[01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:25.560]
And now I just have no opinions about anything.

[01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:26.760]
I respect that.

[01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:27.460]
I respect that.

[01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:28.040]
But listen to it.

[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:28.920]
I don't read the newspaper.

[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:30.120]
I don't watch the news.

[01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:31.740]
I want to be left alone, you know what I mean?

[01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:33.440]
I had to warn you now.

[01:25:33.620 --> 01:25:34.000]
I just...

[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:34.440]
I had to warn you.

[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:35.540]
I know, Marcy.

[01:25:35.900 --> 01:25:36.900]
Isn't this beautiful.

[01:25:37.540 --> 01:25:38.980]
You look like a normal person.

[01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:39.980]
She looks normal.

[01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:40.780]
She's good looking.

[01:25:41.260 --> 01:25:41.600]
Wait a minute.

[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:42.540]
Wait a minute, sir.

[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:43.760]
Let me give you a little music here.

[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:45.440]
We have our management team in here.

[01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:46.580]
Thank you, sir.

[01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:55.880]
All right.

[01:25:57.980 --> 01:25:58.740]
Where's this from?

[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:01.600]
The beautiful birthday cake.

[01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:03.080]
Publix.

[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.320]
Mimey likes from Puebix, huh?

[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:07.480]
Thank you so much.

[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:09.220]
You touched my heart.

[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:11.120]
And other body parts.

[01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:12.980]
What is it?

[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:13.620]
Is it going to fall?

[01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:14.060]
No.

[01:26:14.220 --> 01:26:15.000]
No, I hate listen.

[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:15.680]
It's under control.

[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:16.200]
Trust me.

[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:17.400]
Thank you very much.

[01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:20.500]
On my one-year anniversary, it says don't buy a house.

[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:21.120]
A little print.

[01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:22.060]
I don't even...

[01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:23.580]
Isn't that beautiful?

[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:24.580]
I like it, yeah.

[01:26:24.580 --> 01:26:25.860]
You didn't realize when you came here today.

[01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:27.700]
What a special day for me.

[01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:27.940]
I guess.

[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:30.040]
For me, just don't leave day.

[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:31.880]
But...

[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:35.080]
I got a great idea.

[01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:36.820]
Okay, let's take a vote in the building.

[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:39.640]
You know how they pass out secret ballots.

[01:26:39.860 --> 01:26:40.240]
And nobody...

[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:40.800]
They're not marked.

[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:41.940]
Nobody will know who's...

[01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:42.780]
You know, like the ex.

[01:26:43.300 --> 01:26:44.120]
We'll take a little poll.

[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:45.840]
And we'll see.

[01:26:45.940 --> 01:26:46.980]
Maybe we can get you a new job.

[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:48.380]
Be great.

[01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:50.340]
Okay, I mean, you know, one that really pays.

[01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:53.860]
And we can have the bird.

[01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:57.360]
Can you just see him at the melting pot.

[01:26:58.180 --> 01:26:58.900]
Waiting tables.

[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:01.040]
He's kind of flitting from one table to another.

[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:02.500]
And you can be here every day.

[01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:04.040]
Sounds good.

[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:04.920]
Does that sound good?

[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:05.560]
Sounds good.

[01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:07.900]
All right, so we have the secret ballots now.

[01:27:08.020 --> 01:27:11.120]
Let's put Gina in charge of the secret ballots.

[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:13.980]
You know, like take a bunch of slips of paper.

[01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:14.560]
Can you do that?

[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:16.760]
And sometimes the next ten minutes.

[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:18.820]
So I'm serious about this.

[01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:21.480]
And all they got to do, just on each sheet of paper,

[01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:23.420]
like make Dave or the bird.

[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:24.780]
And like a check place to check.

[01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:25.820]
Seriously, she's laughing.

[01:27:25.820 --> 01:27:28.760]
This is a very serious moment on this program.

[01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:29.740]
It's our one-year anniversary.

[01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:30.700]
This could be the turning point.

[01:27:30.700 --> 01:27:31.600]
And could it do for a change?

[01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:31.960]
Yeah.

[01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:33.840]
Or do perhaps for a little change.

[01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:37.460]
Maybe shake him out of his bad mood in there in the other room.

[01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:39.440]
He seems to be just absolutely...

[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:42.160]
A little too much of that too heavy on the heart's mountain this morning.

[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:44.460]
I think, man, he went nuts on that one brand of bird seed.

[01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:45.340]
He was going crazy.

[01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:46.880]
He's pounding.

[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:49.840]
Well, let's give reason to do it.

[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:52.360]
You know, I don't know that he's got any reason to do it yet.

[01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:55.620]
But let's get about 50 little slips of paper in hand,

[01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:56.420]
or maybe a hundred.

[01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:58.000]
I don't know. We've got so many people at work here

[01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.700]
or go out into parking lot. There might be a few.

[01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:01.460]
And then you can round them all up.

[01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:03.860]
They can all be anonymous, and we'll tally them up.

[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:05.500]
Obviously, Dave or the bird.

[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:07.620]
Obviously, it doesn't want to be here.

[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:08.120]
Absolutely.

[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:09.260]
He's ready to quit.

[01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:16.660]
So we have nine pies and one great big cake.

[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:21.860]
Boy, I told you, no more food on this show, didn't I tell you that?

[01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:25.060]
Okay, are you going to, we'll have to cut that cake.

[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:27.260]
How are we going to do that?

[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:28.900]
Rich will supervise that.

[01:28:28.980 --> 01:28:30.000]
Okay, yeah, I knew you would.

[01:28:30.540 --> 01:28:32.680]
Okay, let's take another call from Dave County

[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:36.060]
while we're cutting up the big cake and having our major celebration.

[01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:36.440]
Hello.

[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:39.000]
Yeah, see?

[01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:39.460]
Yeah.

[01:28:39.860 --> 01:28:40.600]
They love me.

[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:42.740]
Okay, wouldn't hang on.

[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:43.740]
Let's try another one.

[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:46.440]
Dave County, hello.

[01:28:46.860 --> 01:28:48.680]
Yes, this is how you're doing.

[01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:49.100]
Is this Neil?

[01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:49.580]
Yeah.

[01:28:50.060 --> 01:28:52.180]
Yeah, Neil, I want to ask you a question.

[01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:56.740]
I need to find out if you have an extra tape of a...

[01:28:59.660 --> 01:29:01.320]
You know that monsemand that you have?

[01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:03.300]
Oh, yeah. Do I have an extra tape of it?

[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:03.800]
Yes.

[01:29:04.020 --> 01:29:06.160]
No, but I could put it on tape for you if you send me a cassette.

[01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:08.160]
Okay, what's the address then?

[01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:12.640]
W-I-N-Z.

[01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:13.200]
Uh-huh.

[01:29:14.420 --> 01:29:15.140]
My...my Emmy.

[01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:18.720]
33055.

[01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:19.580]
5555.

[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:20.240]
Very good, Dave.

[01:29:20.860 --> 01:29:21.860]
He's already practicing.

[01:29:22.100 --> 01:29:23.700]
He's becoming, you know, like a part of the act.

[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:24.840]
That's right.

[01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:28.920]
Okay, so anyway, okay, I appreciate.

[01:29:29.540 --> 01:29:29.960]
Is that it?

[01:29:30.260 --> 01:29:30.800]
That's it.

[01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:31.800]
Good luck to you, sir.

[01:29:31.940 --> 01:29:32.640]
Okay, thank you.

[01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:34.640]
You bet. Hey, listen, anything for this audience?

[01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:35.660]
They're great. They're wonderful.

[01:29:36.140 --> 01:29:39.780]
They turned out in enormous numbers last night through rain and sleet and snow

[01:29:39.780 --> 01:29:40.940]
and nothing stops them.

[01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:41.900]
Hello.

[01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:42.640]
Bobo?

[01:29:43.020 --> 01:29:43.420]
Bobo?

[01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:44.440]
Bobo?

[01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:46.100]
Uh-huh.

[01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:46.920]
Think of me.

[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:52.040]
Oh, that's Stan.

[01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:52.420]
I'm Tony.

[01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:53.760]
You got a sense of humor or what?

[01:29:54.820 --> 01:29:55.560]
Dave County.

[01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:55.840]
Hello.

[01:29:56.300 --> 01:29:56.440]
Dale?

[01:29:56.720 --> 01:29:56.920]
Yeah.

[01:29:57.200 --> 01:29:58.020]
Hi. How are you today?

[01:29:58.080 --> 01:29:58.300]
Great.

[01:29:58.820 --> 01:30:00.560]
Welcome to W-I-N-Z, sir.

[01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:05.440]
Yes, I came up last night to see you at the ice cream store and it was a pleasure seeing you

[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:07.140]
and there were a lot of very nice people there.

[01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:08.040]
It was a madhouse.

[01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:08.840]
Right.

[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:14.040]
I wondered if I could just have a chance to give you a few of my observations from up there

[01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:14.960]
at the ice cream store.

[01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:15.320]
Sure.

[01:30:16.220 --> 01:30:21.140]
First of all, you were a much better looking guy than I had expected.

[01:30:21.780 --> 01:30:22.180]
Really?

[01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:23.140]
That about you, so.

[01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:25.780]
Is that true, Dave, or what?

[01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:27.980]
Yes, it is.

[01:30:28.100 --> 01:30:30.060]
Yeah, he's saying that because he's eating all the food, you know?

[01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:33.040]
And I pictured you as being kind of overweight.

[01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:34.120]
You didn't?

[01:30:34.140 --> 01:30:36.380]
I didn't look particularly heavy.

[01:30:36.380 --> 01:30:39.180]
You were sitting down so I couldn't really see you.

[01:30:39.260 --> 01:30:39.260]

[01:30:39.340 --> 01:30:41.680]
Well, I was inhaling the whole time, you know.

[01:30:42.140 --> 01:30:43.280]
Well, you've lost some weight, haven't you?

[01:30:43.380 --> 01:30:43.520]
No.

[01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:44.660]
So I heard.

[01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:49.020]
And the bird, he was at a total disappointment.

[01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:49.840]
Really?

[01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:50.240]
Yeah.

[01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:50.620]
Right.

[01:30:50.740 --> 01:30:52.600]
Let's attack him now, you know, unmercifully.

[01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:53.740]
Let's really let him have it.

[01:30:53.940 --> 01:30:57.900]
His behavior today is so bizarre as to be indescribable.

[01:30:58.940 --> 01:31:02.040]
Bird was a very apropos title for him to be called.

[01:31:02.060 --> 01:31:03.300]
I don't know what his story is today.

[01:31:03.380 --> 01:31:03.960]
What is problem?

[01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:05.440]
He just came in here and he started.

[01:31:05.740 --> 01:31:08.040]
In fact, he got Paul to hang up, who was here yesterday.

[01:31:08.180 --> 01:31:09.080]
He was badmouthing him.

[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:11.380]
Got him just all bent out of shape.

[01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:14.720]
And then he started attacking Dave from the moment he came in here

[01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:16.800]
and just got up and left in a snit.

[01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:19.160]
Well, he really had no personality.

[01:31:19.660 --> 01:31:21.840]
He was very quiet, very subdued.

[01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:25.780]
I think he was a little taken aback because you and Stan were getting all the attention.

[01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:27.660]
Well, we weren't anywhere near him.

[01:31:27.660 --> 01:31:30.100]
I don't know how you could say that because we were like in three different groups.

[01:31:30.100 --> 01:31:33.740]
He was inside the store and he was, you know,

[01:31:33.940 --> 01:31:36.000]
autographing all of my pictures, which was kind of bizarre.

[01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:40.080]
And seriously, and then Stan was in one area with all of his being.

[01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:43.480]
I was way in the back, luckily, because I had to find somewhere to sit down,

[01:31:43.580 --> 01:31:45.000]
because otherwise everybody was hovering.

[01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:47.260]
And we were like in three different groups.

[01:31:47.660 --> 01:31:51.100]
It was hard to see you because you were totally surrounded.

[01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:54.660]
And it was sort of hard to see Stan because there were a lot of people around him.

[01:31:54.740 --> 01:31:58.220]
But Glenn was just sitting out there and nobody was watching Stan.

[01:31:59.060 --> 01:32:01.960]
And you could tell why after speaking with him.

[01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:09.920]
I always thought he was such a mild mannered, easygoing, you know, reasonable bird, you know.

[01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:12.140]
Well, he was sort of a nerd as well as it was.

[01:32:12.140 --> 01:32:13.020]
Well, it rhymes.

[01:32:14.620 --> 01:32:16.140]
And as concerned.

[01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:17.040]
Huh?

[01:32:17.380 --> 01:32:20.020]
He was very nice, very present, but I'm going to tell you,

[01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:26.520]
he does have a problem with women because the guy who's looking for women as much as he says he is,

[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:32.540]
there was a young lady there who came up to Stan to get his autograph.

[01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:36.700]
And she was absolutely magnificent in every way.

[01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:37.100]
Yes.

[01:32:37.400 --> 01:32:39.420]
It really seemed to acknowledge her.

[01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:41.540]
I don't know if he was in a day or he just wasn't.

[01:32:41.580 --> 01:32:45.080]
Well, he was probably doing his Brian fixation routine, you know.

[01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:50.360]
At the clock, I say you and I hope you do it again soon.

[01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:51.020]
Thank you.

[01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:54.180]
Okay, welcome to Rip the Bird on W-I-N-Z.

[01:32:54.380 --> 01:32:56.860]
It's a new feature we're going to be doing daily from 10 to 2.

[01:32:58.540 --> 01:32:59.740]
And don't stop now.

[01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:01.680]
I mean, you're just in the middle of an eating frenzy. It's great.

[01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:02.320]
Are you enjoying it?

[01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:03.520]
I've had two pies already.

[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:04.620]
But you've had two pies?

[01:33:04.820 --> 01:33:05.020]
Yes.

[01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:07.560]
Are you enjoying it, though, Dave?

[01:33:08.420 --> 01:33:09.620]
It is unbelievable.

[01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:10.280]
Really?

[01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:10.680]
Yes.

[01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:13.900]
It's a good time for the great taste.

[01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:17.920]
Okay, we'll take a break on that note and get a little pepto bismol, little digeol.

[01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:20.620]
And we'll see if we can't get you ready for the second course.

[01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:21.800]
Okay.

[01:33:22.100 --> 01:33:23.460]
Who still is not back in here?

[01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:24.220]
Want to keep it up, Dave?

[01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:28.900]
So the audience is probably hanging on the edge of their seats, wondering if he's going to come back in here.

[01:33:29.300 --> 01:33:30.080]
I would, I need him, right?

[01:33:30.220 --> 01:33:31.020]
Do you think there's any chance?

[01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:33.000]
No chance.

[01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:34.600]
He's went praying back there.

[01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:37.120]
Okay, let's go to Broward.

[01:33:37.220 --> 01:33:37.400]
Hello.

[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:39.240]
Broward.

[01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:40.000]
Hello, Neil.

[01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:41.480]
Yes, sir. Buenas deeus.

[01:33:41.580 --> 01:33:42.560]
Happy anniversary, Neil.

[01:33:42.740 --> 01:33:43.740]
Thank you so much.

[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:44.620]
Are you talking to me?

[01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:45.520]
I sure am.

[01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:47.680]
You're right about one thing, man.

[01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:49.700]
You know what's it? A bird looks just like a Tweety, man.

[01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:51.400]
You hit that nail right on the head.

[01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:52.340]
Were you there last night?

[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:53.360]
Yes, I was last night.

[01:33:53.460 --> 01:33:54.920]
Okay, well, I wouldn't lie to you.

[01:33:55.100 --> 01:33:55.820]
It was very nice.

[01:33:56.020 --> 01:33:56.600]
It was a nice turnout.

[01:33:56.600 --> 01:33:57.560]
It was nice people.

[01:33:57.740 --> 01:33:59.580]
Yeah, it was such a fun experience.

[01:33:59.580 --> 01:34:02.780]
And then of course you'd come back in here today and its life is usual, you know?

[01:34:03.020 --> 01:34:03.800]
What is his problem?

[01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:06.040]
Like, we, the listener's demand and explanation.

[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:07.100]
Why is he on strike?

[01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:11.380]
Well, he's on strike because he's pouting because he's been upstaged the last two days.

[01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:12.880]
Now, how can he be upstaged yesterday?

[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:15.320]
I don't know, because Paul was a very nice guy.

[01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:17.680]
But he didn't, he didn't, wasn't overbearing.

[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:19.000]
Didn't have an awful lot to say.

[01:34:19.340 --> 01:34:26.080]
Dave, of course, is overwhelmed him because Dave is like a living and breathing human who has a lot, you know, not a lot to say, but is, uh...

[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:29.760]
What I don't understand is, when he came in this morning, the first thing he said to you is,

[01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:31.740]
aren't you going to apologize to yesterday's show?

[01:34:31.900 --> 01:34:34.440]
Yeah, that, that was very strange to me.

[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:34.780]
I don't understand what I meant.

[01:34:34.780 --> 01:34:35.360]
I don't have any idea.

[01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:38.480]
And then of course Paul did call it and he blew him away in no time.

[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:43.840]
And I said here with the phone dangling and I don't know what, you've got to understand the big problem that happened.

[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:51.840]
So when I went on vacation, since that moment, the bird has become like bigger than life, if you pardon that expression, or it's a movie's called it.

[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:55.700]
But he's become just overwhelmed with his popularity now.

[01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:58.420]
And I guess he's probably going to start his own station and...

[01:34:58.420 --> 01:34:59.540]
I think he could handle it.

[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:07.000]
In fact, we saw him yesterday afternoon when he was preparing to go to the ice cream store, he was out of the back building a huge nest back there, right under tower number two.

[01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:10.120]
So I think he's probably going to start his own station back there.

[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:12.340]
That's what he's doing today, Bill, in a nest on tower three.

[01:35:12.820 --> 01:35:13.160]
Yeah.

[01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:15.500]
A couple of quick questions for you, Neil.

[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:16.560]
The Tower of Power.

[01:35:16.820 --> 01:35:18.800]
I watched Larry King last night.

[01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:21.120]
Well listen, life is not perfect, sir.

[01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:25.280]
And he says that 143 high, what is that supposed to mean?

[01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:30.820]
Well, you know, there are no football games he wants to make America feel like they still have a little touch, you know, with the NFL.

[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:32.680]
No, that's his big signal to Angie.

[01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:33.840]
Is that what that is?

[01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:36.680]
143, which is the most detachiest thing in the world.

[01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:42.620]
Well, first of all, the idea that Angie would do anything with any part of Larry King's body is so disgusting to begin with.

[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:43.800]
No one would like to imagine.

[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:47.320]
I mean, Larry King could be the ugliest person in the history of the human race, okay?

[01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:50.080]
And Angie, even at her age, is still pretty well built.

[01:35:50.340 --> 01:35:50.900]
Very well, Bill.

[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:52.080]
Yeah, you can say that again.

[01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:57.160]
And if I took it about Bill, I was the guy who was standing there last night when you were signing that woman's t-shirt.

[01:35:57.500 --> 01:35:59.180]
Oh yeah, writing on her boob, yeah.

[01:35:59.540 --> 01:36:00.000]
It's quite interesting.

[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:00.720]
Yeah.

[01:36:00.940 --> 01:36:02.760]
The other question I wanted to ask you, that's...

[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:04.460]
That's all I get, see, the story of my life.

[01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:08.000]
Nobody came along and said, you know, can you sign anywhere else?

[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:11.380]
He had exactly what you said last night.

[01:36:11.700 --> 01:36:11.860]
Yeah.

[01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:14.360]
I was like, I was standing above you.

[01:36:14.780 --> 01:36:17.660]
When you first sat down, I said, okay, Angie, I can start the math.

[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:19.460]
Oh yeah, I'd be honest with you.

[01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:21.120]
I was in a fog.

[01:36:21.700 --> 01:36:22.120]
I feel...

[01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:24.040]
They were crowding around you, but I tell you, Neil...

[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:28.640]
And then when that woman kept pressing her crotch against my knee, that's the heavy woman.

[01:36:28.860 --> 01:36:30.320]
No, no, there was a heavy...

[01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:33.800]
And I thought, oh my God, what is your name so I can write this in please?

[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:36.100]
I mean, this is not what I had in mind, you know.

[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:38.300]
Yeah, really.

[01:36:38.820 --> 01:36:40.320]
You're the question I wanted to ask you.

[01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:43.720]
Is that really Frankie Valley on that Joey Pinto song?

[01:36:51.740 --> 01:36:52.840]
Turn it up, America.

[01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:55.180]
Turn it up into front office.

[01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:56.300]
Give Gary a hernia.

[01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:01.480]
Yes, it is.

[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:03.440]
Let me tell you a little story about all those things.

[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:05.800]
You know, Joey, I'm sure he's still playing a lot of that crap.

[01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:13.020]
Years ago, like way back before they invented the wheel, they used to have a service for this jockeys,

[01:37:13.020 --> 01:37:18.000]
where groups would record customized show opens, you know, like the charelles and...

[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:18.580]
Like that one, right?

[01:37:18.620 --> 01:37:20.480]
...the four seasons and Frankie Valley.

[01:37:20.820 --> 01:37:25.600]
And all of the stuff that they had, or at least most of the stuff that they had at WKVW and Buffalo,

[01:37:25.780 --> 01:37:29.920]
was stuff like this that was custom made for the station.

[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:31.600]
And for their jockeys.

[01:37:31.740 --> 01:37:31.960]
Right.

[01:37:32.180 --> 01:37:33.200]
And that's what that was.

[01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:34.420]
So that comes out of it.

[01:37:34.420 --> 01:37:37.500]
It's not like Frankie Valley came in and said, oh, my good friend, like, you know,

[01:37:37.540 --> 01:37:39.060]
that thing he plays by Wolfman Jack.

[01:37:39.340 --> 01:37:40.880]
I mean, let's get serious.

[01:37:41.100 --> 01:37:41.560]
Set up, man.

[01:37:41.740 --> 01:37:43.820]
It's like it's a promo type of deal.

[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:45.060]
It's not really anything legitimate.

[01:37:45.060 --> 01:37:47.700]
Like Frankie Valley really wasn't his friend, like he said.

[01:37:47.820 --> 01:37:49.480]
Well, maybe he was his friend, I don't know.

[01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:51.540]
But it was just in conjunction with the station, baby.

[01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:53.660]
What they say, birds of a feather swing together.

[01:37:54.780 --> 01:37:56.920]
And that bird really does look like a bird.

[01:37:56.920 --> 01:37:59.520]
Oh, well, we're not missing him.

[01:37:59.660 --> 01:38:00.720]
You're a friend there, Paul.

[01:38:01.380 --> 01:38:01.640]
Dave.

[01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:02.120]
Dave.

[01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:04.960]
Dave, is Dave entertaining you today?

[01:38:05.180 --> 01:38:05.920]
He's doing a good job.

[01:38:06.100 --> 01:38:06.660]
Yeah, he's fine.

[01:38:06.660 --> 01:38:07.840]
He's eating up a storm.

[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:08.500]
He's smiling.

[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:09.100]
He's pleasant.

[01:38:09.100 --> 01:38:12.600]
He's not making any cost of comments about our other guests.

[01:38:12.860 --> 01:38:15.160]
Taking a straight joke is the curb joke.

[01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:15.780]
Yeah.

[01:38:16.380 --> 01:38:17.580]
And they're not so straight jokes.

[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:19.080]
Okay.

[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:19.640]
Thanks a lot.

[01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:20.880]
Take it easy.

[01:38:21.020 --> 01:38:21.260]
Bye-bye.

[01:38:21.940 --> 01:38:23.560]
We're getting rave reviews already.

[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:23.920]
Great.

[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:27.420]
Okay, let's take a call from Dave County again,

[01:38:27.420 --> 01:38:29.120]
because I know that somebody in Dave loves it.

[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:30.160]
Oh, you got the score sheet?

[01:38:31.460 --> 01:38:35.620]
Oh, in other words, you just had a, okay, Gina has gone around the building.

[01:38:35.620 --> 01:38:35.640]
Right.

[01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:38.920]
Ladies and gentlemen, this is an incredible moment.

[01:38:39.140 --> 01:38:39.800]
Do we have a drum roll?

[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:43.280]
No, we got something better than that, because we had that young lady who called the Canadian.

[01:38:43.740 --> 01:38:43.920]
Yeah.

[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:44.820]
Okay.

[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:48.460]
We can ever get Joey Reynolds to stop playing on the car machine.

[01:38:56.220 --> 01:38:59.660]
We may have a new national bird of Canada in just a moment, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:00.900]
Thank you so much.

[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:31.740]
This staff, we may have to call in some outside help.

[01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:32.300]
You know what I mean?

[01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:37.560]
Like my friend, my pie's on over on the beach.

[01:39:37.780 --> 01:39:39.600]
And I have to get him some new help in here.

[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:44.920]
Popular opinion, there are 16 nerds, okay, in the building.

[01:39:46.700 --> 01:39:49.560]
50, let's see, 510-13 want the bird.

[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:51.420]
Nobody wants Dave.

[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:52.600]
What?

[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:54.660]
Well, I didn't vote.

[01:39:55.740 --> 01:39:56.780]
Two are undecided.

[01:39:58.080 --> 01:39:59.720]
J. Michaels voted for himself.

[01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:02.280]
There's a little asterisk here.

[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:05.860]
It says this survey is based on the 16 people who are in the building right now.

[01:40:06.580 --> 01:40:10.400]
Jean Cashman, who of course is a great programming expert beyond a shadow of a doll,

[01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:12.960]
one of our brilliant programming experts.

[01:40:13.740 --> 01:40:16.720]
Her expertise probably is unlimited in broadcasting.

[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:20.380]
Thought that Dave wasn't exciting enough needs to talk more.

[01:40:21.460 --> 01:40:22.740]
Talk to me more, I'll talk.

[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:23.740]
Let's go.

[01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:25.280]
Let me see that.

[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:26.760]
There you go.

[01:40:26.860 --> 01:40:27.420]
Can you believe that?

[01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:29.440]
It's a shut out.

[01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:35.860]
However, we did put in a call to another brilliant programming expert Rick Sklar

[01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:37.680]
in New York to put in a long distance call.

[01:40:38.340 --> 01:40:39.220]
And he voted for Dave.

[01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:42.660]
We put in a call to Bill Tanner.

[01:40:42.860 --> 01:40:44.060]
He also voted for Dave.

[01:40:44.740 --> 01:40:45.300]
I'm speechless.

[01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:48.680]
Wait a minute, but you're not hearing the rest of these things.

[01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:49.960]
Bill Tanner voted for you.

[01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:52.160]
Bill Tanner, how do you know?

[01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:53.560]
Rick Sklar voted for you.

[01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:54.120]
How do you know?

[01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:55.680]
Sonny Fox voted for you.

[01:40:57.040 --> 01:40:58.520]
You know who else voted for you?

[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:00.420]
It's a good time.

[01:41:00.620 --> 01:41:01.100]
There you go.

[01:41:01.380 --> 01:41:02.400]
Donald voted for you.

[01:41:03.660 --> 01:41:06.620]
So you see the votes are coming in from the real broadcasting people.

[01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:09.040]
Well, I think we need the audience's opinion, not the agency.

[01:41:09.220 --> 01:41:09.620]
Exactly.

[01:41:09.900 --> 01:41:10.440]
Good thinking.

[01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:12.480]
Boy, what a great way to kill the last half hour.

[01:41:12.660 --> 01:41:12.920]
Exactly.

[01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:16.040]
This guy, listen, I'm telling you, you could be dangerous.

[01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:18.220]
You might be sitting in this chair any minute now.

[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:21.200]
I'll still be sitting here too, but that's another story.

[01:41:21.660 --> 01:41:24.560]
Okay, let's go on what we're going to do in this last half hour.

[01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:26.540]
And if you're calling for other reasons, don't run away.

[01:41:26.620 --> 01:41:28.380]
But we would just ask in passing, right?

[01:41:28.940 --> 01:41:29.120]
Right.

[01:41:29.340 --> 01:41:29.880]
In passing.

[01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:31.240]
What a little poll.

[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:32.460]
What you, what say you?

[01:41:32.540 --> 01:41:33.100]
You say what?

[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:34.440]
Dave County.

[01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:34.760]
Hello.

[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:35.380]
Hello.

[01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:36.240]
Yes, sir.

[01:41:36.620 --> 01:41:37.040]
Hi, Neil.

[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:37.560]
How are you doing?

[01:41:37.860 --> 01:41:38.440]
Two things.

[01:41:39.140 --> 01:41:42.780]
Number one is, did you know that birds eat two and a half times

[01:41:42.780 --> 01:41:44.060]
their own body weight?

[01:41:44.060 --> 01:41:45.420]
Yeah, I've seen it.

[01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:47.460]
I've watched it with my own eyes day after day.

[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:51.800]
Okay, and the other things I heard the caller before about the gay bowling league.

[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:52.220]
Yeah.

[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:55.160]
I was on the gay bowling league.

[01:41:55.420 --> 01:41:55.700]
Really?

[01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:56.500]
At one time.

[01:41:56.920 --> 01:41:57.580]
And it pulled me.

[01:41:57.900 --> 01:41:58.640]
It was us.

[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:01.860]
And there was also the group of Baptist.

[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:03.680]
Baptist?

[01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:04.500]
Yes.

[01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:06.060]
No, Baptist.

[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:07.000]
Okay, I'm sorry.

[01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:09.260]
That took over the soul.

[01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:09.780]
Wait a minute.

[01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:11.100]
What is it that you're looking for, Gene?

[01:42:11.660 --> 01:42:13.000]
That took over the soul bowling.

[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:13.940]
Is there any pizza left?

[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:16.240]
And there's a pizza right there.

[01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:17.920]
Or no, it's an antiposta.

[01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:18.620]
Like that.

[01:42:18.900 --> 01:42:20.400]
And I ran into my sister.

[01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:22.020]
Hey, listen, don't be choosy, Gene.

[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:23.080]
It's the price is right.

[01:42:23.180 --> 01:42:23.640]
Go ahead, sir.

[01:42:23.780 --> 01:42:24.080]
I'm sorry.

[01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:26.800]
I ran into my little sister.

[01:42:27.100 --> 01:42:27.340]
Really?

[01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:28.880]
At the bowling alley.

[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:29.280]
Yeah.

[01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:30.100]
I'm hanging out there.

[01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:32.340]
Dave says he would like to run into your little sister.

[01:42:33.020 --> 01:42:35.800]
But, uh, oh, she said, what are you doing here?

[01:42:35.860 --> 01:42:37.080]
I said I'm bowling on a league.

[01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:39.140]
She said, oh, no, Ray.

[01:42:39.460 --> 01:42:39.960]
Please don't.

[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:40.480]
Tell me.

[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:42.140]
You become adaptive.

[01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:47.260]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:48.480]
Oh, that's a gay bowling.

[01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:49.380]
That's pretty good.

[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:51.060]
Wait, you have a good day.

Where you born but hit or did you work at it your whole life?

Either way, worked out fine because you're a butt head tonight.

[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:40.780]
You're a VUTG H A D and don't try to blame it on me.

[01:48:42.380 --> 01:48:48.400]
You deserve all the credit because you're a butt head tonight.

[01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:56.280]
You were a butt head yesterday and you're a butt head tonight.

[01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:04.200]
I've got a feeling you'll be a butt head to risk to your life.

[01:49:04.380 --> 01:49:10.760]
Let's take it, here we go, where you born but hit or did you work at it your whole life?

[01:49:13.540 --> 01:49:20.440]
Either way, worked out fine because you're a butt head tonight.

[01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:20.940]
Oh!

[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:47.680]
I was talking to your mother just the other night and I told her that I bought the two of a butt head.

[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:51.360]
She said, yes, I think you're right.

[01:49:52.380 --> 01:49:59.440]
And all your friends are butt heads because you've known them your whole life.

[01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:07.160]
And somebody told me you got a butt head for a while.

[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:15.200]
There we go, where you born but hit or did you work at it your whole life?

[01:50:16.620 --> 01:50:22.640]
Either way, worked out fine because you're a butt head tonight.

[01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:31.280]
Everybody join in where you born but hit or did you work at it your whole life?

[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:38.560]
Either way, worked out fine because you're a butt head tonight.

[01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:40.100]
Let's do that last line.

[01:50:40.180 --> 01:50:58.380]
Either way, it worked out fine because you're a butt head tonight.

[01:51:02.020 --> 01:51:02.820]
Oh yeah.

[01:51:05.240 --> 01:51:08.840]
Okay, 19 before 2 at W Y and Z. Cake is good by the way.

[01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:09.860]
Yes, very good.

[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:10.300]
Excellent.

[01:51:10.420 --> 01:51:13.140]
I like the management and all of the other fakers in the building.

[01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:15.480]
And very good. It is from Pueblox, huh?

[01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:15.820]
Yes.

[01:51:16.680 --> 01:51:18.760]
Just imagine if it would have been from Windixie.

[01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:21.660]
I guess maybe after two years.

[01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:24.040]
Okay, let's take our next break and we'll be right back.

[01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:28.800]
Okay, well listen, if I have to find something in Iraq, you're going to have to fill the time.

[01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:29.500]
You understand that?

[01:51:29.940 --> 01:51:30.300]
Okay.

[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.020]
Kyle, let's take a call.

[01:51:35.660 --> 01:51:37.520]
Well, see, I have to go ahead.

[01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:38.720]
You take the call and I'll look.

[01:51:38.860 --> 01:51:39.740]
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

[01:51:39.920 --> 01:51:40.060]
Okay.

[01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:40.760]
Take a phone call.

[01:51:41.180 --> 01:51:41.540]
Hello.

[01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:43.200]
Hello, Neil.

[01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:43.900]
Yes.

[01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:46.940]
I just throw my voting for Glenn.

[01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:48.860]
He's the only one who has his own.

[01:51:50.460 --> 01:51:51.460]
His own what?

[01:51:51.460 --> 01:51:52.080]
What's the theme?

[01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:53.160]
Are you for this one?

[01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:55.840]
I went to everybody's head.

[01:51:56.120 --> 01:51:56.920]
I bought the bed.

[01:51:57.260 --> 01:51:58.220]
The bed, bed, bed.

[01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:00.620]
The best of when, a bed, bed, bed.

[01:52:00.900 --> 01:52:02.920]
The best of when, a bed, bed, bed.

[01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:03.180]
The best of when, a bed, bed, bed.

[01:52:03.300 --> 01:52:04.280]
The best of when, a bed, bed, bed.

[01:52:04.280 --> 01:52:04.380]
The best of when, a bed, bed, bed.

[01:52:04.380 --> 01:52:05.020]
What do you think of that one?

[01:52:05.420 --> 01:52:06.280]
Yeah, one of my favorites.

[01:52:06.840 --> 01:52:08.980]
Yeah, somebody at the mega band is a 60s.

[01:52:08.980 --> 01:52:09.640]
The trash man.

[01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:10.940]
Am I right?

[01:52:11.240 --> 01:52:11.880]
Yes, you are.

[01:52:12.080 --> 01:52:12.200]
Yeah.

[01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:13.940]
Well, you know, they had so many hits.

[01:52:14.240 --> 01:52:16.820]
I heard that song and I just automatically thought it glimmed.

[01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:19.000]
I heard that on a show in town the other morning.

[01:52:19.060 --> 01:52:19.980]
I want to say which one.

[01:52:19.980 --> 01:52:21.760]
Well, we have that tape too, only.

[01:52:22.120 --> 01:52:22.920]
No, we don't have that one.

[01:52:22.980 --> 01:52:24.760]
We have Larry Bird in here somewhere else.

[01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:26.040]
Oh, just looking for it.

[01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:28.360]
But yeah, I got that in the other room, but I wouldn't waste the card.

[01:52:28.900 --> 01:52:30.760]
Very keen program for it to play that, I guess, huh?

[01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:31.280]
Yeah.

[01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:34.080]
So I, you last night, had a good time.

[01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:36.960]
I enjoyed the picture of the girl with the t-shirt you were signing there.

[01:52:37.180 --> 01:52:37.400]
Really?

[01:52:37.940 --> 01:52:38.820]
That was fun.

[01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:41.180]
Yeah, she had everybody writing all over her chest.

[01:52:41.180 --> 01:52:43.420]
It was pretty exciting for some.

[01:52:43.640 --> 01:52:47.400]
And it weren't more people signing, and they could have gotten more interesting places.

[01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:49.720]
It was not too stimulating for me, but, you know,

[01:52:50.560 --> 01:52:51.760]
it was a good time, though.

[01:52:51.860 --> 01:52:52.620]
Yeah, it was. It was great.

[01:52:52.700 --> 01:52:53.300]
I had a ball.

[01:52:53.420 --> 01:52:54.340]
Look forward to seeing you soon.

[01:52:54.520 --> 01:52:54.760]
Okay.

[01:52:55.040 --> 01:52:56.060]
I'll read you the arch.

[01:52:56.180 --> 01:52:57.540]
Bye-bye. Okay. One vote for the bird.

[01:52:57.880 --> 01:52:58.900]
A little sympathy vote.

[01:52:59.320 --> 01:53:00.560]
Uh, Dave County. Hello.

[01:53:00.920 --> 01:53:02.020]
Hi, Adele. How are you doing today?

[01:53:02.260 --> 01:53:02.520]
Okay.

[01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:04.160]
Still taking your poll here?

[01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:05.920]
We certainly are. It's life and death.

[01:53:06.140 --> 01:53:09.640]
Life and death. Well, my position on this is if you're happy, I'm happy.

[01:53:10.520 --> 01:53:12.080]
Well, a vote is for Dave, then, I guess.

[01:53:13.380 --> 01:53:14.980]
Is that not a committal enough?

[01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:16.920]
Hey, listen, I want to tell you something.

[01:53:16.920 --> 01:53:20.360]
I mean, you know, just come in every day and have somebody sitting here who was smiling

[01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:24.000]
and in a good mood and also, um, on a scale of one is about an 800.

[01:53:24.180 --> 01:53:25.220]
You know, I mean, that's not bad.

[01:53:25.220 --> 01:53:26.960]
It just doesn't hurt to look, you know.

[01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:29.180]
I heard you mentioned Fredonia earlier.

[01:53:29.260 --> 01:53:30.160]
I went to school there.

[01:53:31.660 --> 01:53:32.060]
Fredonia?

[01:53:32.280 --> 01:53:35.080]
I sure did. It wasn't the duck soup for Donia, either.

[01:53:35.220 --> 01:53:39.100]
Wow. While there's a big hit movie in Buffalo, and I'll call Francis Does Fredonia,

[01:53:39.100 --> 01:53:41.300]
which is coming out next Monday. It's going to be fantastic.

[01:53:41.580 --> 01:53:42.820]
Pretty wild. Pretty wild.

[01:53:43.020 --> 01:53:44.580]
I got a couple of questions here for you.

[01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:45.040]
Yes.

[01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:47.140]
What's the deal with Kyle? Is he leaving you?

[01:53:47.860 --> 01:53:49.660]
He's just moving in the mornings.

[01:53:49.980 --> 01:53:50.660]
Is that so on my right?

[01:53:50.860 --> 01:53:51.900]
Or did we have another change yet?

[01:53:51.980 --> 01:53:52.860]
Are you still moving in the morning?

[01:53:53.080 --> 01:53:53.940]
Okay, next week.

[01:53:55.060 --> 01:53:55.740]
Next week.

[01:53:56.020 --> 01:53:56.980]
Is that going to Toledo?

[01:53:57.260 --> 01:53:58.640]
No, he's not going to Toledo.

[01:53:58.780 --> 01:54:01.680]
He may have relatives working in Toledo, but that's another story.

[01:54:01.820 --> 01:54:06.960]
Did you have a meeting with the higher ups as far as your Saturday thing?

[01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:10.100]
Well, we have some interesting things.

[01:54:10.300 --> 01:54:11.300]
Let's just put it this way.

[01:54:11.420 --> 01:54:13.860]
We have some interesting things that may be developing.

[01:54:15.340 --> 01:54:16.200]
One can get.

[01:54:16.660 --> 01:54:16.920]
No.

[01:54:17.300 --> 01:54:19.260]
I'm not going to, but one can't get.

[01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:21.400]
Really? Well, good luck to you, sir.

[01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:25.880]
Also, I'm the fellow that arranged for you to get those Mojo Nixon records.

[01:54:26.260 --> 01:54:27.580]
Great. Where am I CDs, buddy?

[01:54:27.660 --> 01:54:30.380]
I was going to ask you if they showed up because I checked with the record company.

[01:54:30.500 --> 01:54:32.420]
They said they indeed sent you some.

[01:54:32.620 --> 01:54:33.420]
Well, we didn't get them.

[01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:37.540]
First, we have somebody who intercepts a lot of the mail, and I want to mention a names.

[01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:38.020]
Okay.

[01:54:38.660 --> 01:54:40.340]
We're influenced to pull, but...

[01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:43.040]
Okay. If you're interested, I'm going to give a call.

[01:54:43.160 --> 01:54:45.820]
I know the folks over at Rhino Records that you're interested in,

[01:54:45.820 --> 01:54:49.520]
Mike, getting you some kosher club and Yiddish people, things to give away.

[01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:50.520]
Oh, I would love to have those.

[01:54:50.740 --> 01:54:53.640]
I mean, those would go like potato pancakes.

[01:54:53.900 --> 01:54:56.480]
And I know those guys over there, so I'll see what I can do for you.

[01:54:56.600 --> 01:55:01.880]
And also, Mojo Nixon is going to be doing a bit of a public relations type tour.

[01:55:02.180 --> 01:55:07.240]
And if you're interested or if Stan is interested, I think we can arrange to have him on the show.

[01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:10.100]
I think he's going to be a town October 8th.

[01:55:10.100 --> 01:55:13.300]
Great. The Wednesday, coincidentally, it's the first day of soccer.

[01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:16.540]
Well, if Stan ever comes in here, we can find out what the story is.

[01:55:16.620 --> 01:55:17.600]
Would you be interested?

[01:55:17.860 --> 01:55:20.520]
He may also be, boy, no, we don't have too many gatherings.

[01:55:21.020 --> 01:55:22.480]
Limited number of guests on this show.

[01:55:23.180 --> 01:55:24.480]
Like today, yesterday.

[01:55:25.660 --> 01:55:26.180]
Like today.

[01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:27.200]
Yeah, okay.

[01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:30.260]
All right. Well, maybe I'll ask Stan Lee T. If he's interested in that.

[01:55:30.340 --> 01:55:30.620]
Okay.

[01:55:30.860 --> 01:55:32.820]
All right. I'll see what I can do for you on the other stuff.

[01:55:32.820 --> 01:55:37.000]
And one other thing I've met Don Agony a bunch of times when he used to be a taxi.

[01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:39.080]
Yes.

[01:55:39.420 --> 01:55:41.260]
Is a waste of proto-plasma.

[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:44.420]
He is a great argument for birth control.

[01:55:44.760 --> 01:55:48.360]
I think sterilization is the word you were looking for.

[01:55:48.660 --> 01:55:53.360]
Well, you know, if you can work out a retroactive abortion, he's a good candidate for it.

[01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:54.720]
Okay. See you by.

[01:55:55.020 --> 01:55:55.340]
Adios.

[01:55:55.940 --> 01:56:00.320]
Okay. The poll is just devastating so far in one direction.

[01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:01.580]
Date County. Hello.

[01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:03.900]
What's wrong? I voted bad.

[01:56:04.580 --> 01:56:05.100]
What's wrong?

[01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:08.940]
Okay. Well, you hear the nature of his callers don't you the people who want him?

[01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:09.740]
Oh, boy.

[01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:10.120]
Exactly.

[01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:12.700]
Some foul callers on this show today.

[01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:15.000]
Let's take another one from Broward. Hello.

[01:56:15.220 --> 01:56:16.140]
Yes, sir.

[01:56:16.420 --> 01:56:17.880]
Let me show my razor down here, okay?

[01:56:17.980 --> 01:56:18.780]
Please, please.

[01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:20.680]
Try to control yourself.

[01:56:23.740 --> 01:56:24.520]
Okay. I'm back.

[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:25.560]
Great.

[01:56:26.300 --> 01:56:27.600]
You're still taking this poll?

[01:56:27.820 --> 01:56:29.220]
We're doing whatever the hell you want, sir.

[01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:30.600]
It's a great day.

[01:56:31.060 --> 01:56:34.960]
Well, Dave sounds like a super guy.

[01:56:35.220 --> 01:56:35.800]
He sounds nice.

[01:56:36.020 --> 01:56:41.300]
But I mean, you know, we out here listening audience cannot see what he looks like.

[01:56:41.920 --> 01:56:45.400]
And listening to him is about as exciting as watching concrete hard.

[01:56:46.420 --> 01:56:48.100]
Well, I got news for you.

[01:56:48.140 --> 01:56:51.620]
There may be something else that would harden if, you know, but that's another story.

[01:56:51.700 --> 01:56:53.300]
But we can't we can't see him.

[01:56:53.340 --> 01:56:54.600]
I mean, trust me.

[01:56:54.840 --> 01:56:56.160]
He sounds like a nice guy.

[01:56:56.300 --> 01:56:57.420]
He is. He's a great guy.

[01:56:57.420 --> 01:57:00.400]
Well, I mean, I want to know when you leave here, he will never be seen again.

[01:57:00.520 --> 01:57:01.040]
I'm taking the moment.

[01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:03.580]
What the bird do that I do better than me?

[01:57:05.080 --> 01:57:08.100]
Well, the bird, you don't, you don't like jump in enough.

[01:57:08.300 --> 01:57:11.940]
You just kind of sit there and wait for Neil to kick you in the butt and then you say something.

[01:57:12.020 --> 01:57:13.840]
I haven't kicked him in the butt once yet, sir.

[01:57:13.980 --> 01:57:14.800]
Well, you'd like to.

[01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:17.500]
Well, I don't care. I have to hold up and start.

[01:57:17.800 --> 01:57:19.980]
But I mean, you just sit. I mean, it's your big day.

[01:57:20.180 --> 01:57:21.480]
I'm not into discipline, okay?

[01:57:22.040 --> 01:57:23.160]
Okay. Well, I'm trying to say it.

[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:25.200]
I think I'm doing a fine job.

[01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:26.400]
Yeah, that's it.

[01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:28.920]
And if you think you can do a better job here.

[01:57:29.620 --> 01:57:31.540]
Well, you just, I mean, it's your big day.

[01:57:31.660 --> 01:57:33.520]
You gotta just jump in there and take charge.

[01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:37.140]
I mean, he'll be a lot better tomorrow.

[01:57:37.920 --> 01:57:39.840]
Okay. I mean, you know, you come back tomorrow?

[01:57:40.220 --> 01:57:42.560]
Yep. I guess it's, I mean, just stay on.

[01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:44.920]
We should all.

[01:57:45.460 --> 01:57:49.680]
But just as kind of a, how do I describe it gently?

[01:57:49.680 --> 01:57:51.200]
In other words, like a little message.

[01:57:51.880 --> 01:57:52.740]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:53.580]
That's me.

[01:57:54.100 --> 01:57:55.540]
Yeah. What do you say?

[01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:58.620]
Well, when somebody gets a little bit per snippety,

[01:57:58.720 --> 01:58:01.560]
and that's a nice word because it's like kind of neuter,

[01:58:01.900 --> 01:58:02.560]
like the bird.

[01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:06.440]
When somebody gets a little bit too big for their bridges,

[01:58:06.660 --> 01:58:08.760]
then you have to kind of intimidate them a little bit, right?

[01:58:09.040 --> 01:58:09.220]
Yeah.

[01:58:09.680 --> 01:58:11.640]
Now, don't you think that if Dave shows up again tomorrow?

[01:58:11.740 --> 01:58:13.160]
And of course tomorrow he'll be a little looser.

[01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:16.080]
To probably have a lot more to say that that would be,

[01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:17.380]
represent a threat.

[01:58:18.060 --> 01:58:20.680]
I guess basically you're doing a good job.

[01:58:20.680 --> 01:58:21.400]
Yeah, see?

[01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:22.120]
You can't.

[01:58:22.460 --> 01:58:23.440]
It's his first day.

[01:58:23.560 --> 01:58:25.400]
I mean, you've got to remember, he just walked in here

[01:58:25.400 --> 01:58:27.640]
out of the cold and he's at least sounded looser.

[01:58:27.700 --> 01:58:29.680]
He hasn't had a lot to say yet because he's just getting the

[01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:30.760]
feel of things, so to speak.

[01:58:30.980 --> 01:58:33.460]
Well, this isn't the best phone call I've heard either.

[01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:33.900]
Yeah.

[01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:35.680]
I mean, what do you want me to do?

[01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:37.480]
When we talk about gay people, what?

[01:58:38.540 --> 01:58:40.460]
You're not taking a poll.

[01:58:40.600 --> 01:58:41.540]
Yeah, do it. You do best.

[01:58:41.780 --> 01:58:43.040]
Okay. All right.

[01:58:43.080 --> 01:58:44.180]
Well, he already voted for the bird.

[01:58:44.400 --> 01:58:47.020]
So, you know, okay, where are we going to go next?

[01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:49.360]
Probably the date county because that's where they really know

[01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:50.240]
what's happening. Hello.

[01:58:50.480 --> 01:58:50.880]
Hello.

[01:58:51.200 --> 01:58:51.720]
Yes, sir.

[01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:52.220]
Deal.

[01:58:52.540 --> 01:58:52.860]
Yes.

[01:58:53.160 --> 01:58:57.360]
It's here in my anniversary and, uh, in Dave's, too.

[01:58:57.440 --> 01:58:59.520]
And I was wondering, uh, you know, the phone number?

[01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:01.380]
It's your anniversary and Dave's?

[01:59:01.480 --> 01:59:04.100]
I mean, well, I hope you guys have a wonderful life period.

[01:59:04.260 --> 01:59:04.660]
I don't know.

[01:59:04.820 --> 01:59:07.480]
We would have had a little cake, a little, uh, something special for Dave.

[01:59:07.620 --> 01:59:10.640]
Yeah. What I meant was all three of us is the thiriniversary.

[01:59:10.860 --> 01:59:11.480]
You, Dave and I.

[01:59:12.120 --> 01:59:13.000]
What does that mean?

[01:59:13.940 --> 01:59:14.340]
Okay.

[01:59:14.760 --> 01:59:16.600]
It's our one day anniversary together.

[01:59:16.940 --> 01:59:18.140]
You've been on the air for a year.

[01:59:18.140 --> 01:59:18.840]
Dave's one.

[01:59:18.840 --> 01:59:20.100]
Well, I haven't been on the air for a year.

[01:59:20.160 --> 01:59:21.140]
I've been on the air for a lifetime.

[01:59:21.140 --> 01:59:28.760]
But I mean, one year in this day, uh, and, uh, it's been Dave's, uh, one year working at

[01:59:28.760 --> 01:59:29.340]
the melting pot.

[01:59:29.640 --> 01:59:29.900]
Yeah.

[01:59:30.240 --> 01:59:30.680]
And, uh, it's been Dave's, uh, one year working at the melting pot.

[01:59:30.680 --> 01:59:30.680]

[01:59:30.680 --> 01:59:31.780]
And, uh, it's my girlfriend's in my anniversary.

[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:33.100]
Wow. All right.

[01:59:33.240 --> 01:59:33.600]
Congratulations.

[01:59:33.900 --> 01:59:34.260]
Great.

[01:59:34.260 --> 01:59:35.300]
A little, uh, come on.

[01:59:35.380 --> 01:59:36.800]
I'd like to join you, but I don't know.

[01:59:36.940 --> 01:59:38.920]
I'm going to put the phone number to the melting pot.

[01:59:39.260 --> 01:59:39.840]
You'd like to what?

[01:59:40.200 --> 01:59:41.780]
We can't find the phone number to the melting pot.

[01:59:42.440 --> 01:59:43.920]
You know how to dial 411?

[01:59:44.860 --> 01:59:45.580]
Cool spring.

[01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:46.480]
Give him the number.

[01:59:46.640 --> 01:59:46.940]
Come on.

[01:59:46.940 --> 01:59:47.740]
755.

[01:59:47.740 --> 01:59:48.560]
5, 50, hostel.

[01:59:49.540 --> 01:59:49.980]
6368.

[01:59:50.900 --> 01:59:51.200]
Okay.

[01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:52.440]
That's in cool springs.

[01:59:52.740 --> 01:59:53.040]
What is it?

[01:59:53.220 --> 01:59:53.500]
What's the number road?

[01:59:53.740 --> 01:59:54.080]
What's the number?

[01:59:54.720 --> 01:59:55.500]
Did you get the number?

[01:59:55.740 --> 01:59:56.720]
You don't want the Miami one.

[01:59:56.740 --> 01:59:58.060]
What's going to be at the cool springs one?

[01:59:58.600 --> 01:59:58.840]
Okay.

[01:59:59.380 --> 02:00:02.320]
But maybe he wants to take his girlfriend to the one down there.

[02:00:02.580 --> 02:00:04.240]
I don't know the number of the Miami ones.

[02:00:04.580 --> 02:00:06.280]
It's on the Sunset.

[02:00:07.100 --> 02:00:07.240]
Yeah.

[02:00:07.480 --> 02:00:07.840]
Sunset.

[02:00:08.160 --> 02:00:09.040]
Where are you still lived?

[02:00:09.140 --> 02:00:10.160]
Where the bird lives down there?

[02:00:10.420 --> 02:00:10.600]
Yeah.

[02:00:11.100 --> 02:00:11.600]
God forbid.

[02:00:14.160 --> 02:00:15.520]
And Dave says it's great.

[02:00:16.060 --> 02:00:16.260]
Yeah.

[02:00:17.080 --> 02:00:19.100]
Did you cast a voter did I miss it?

[02:00:19.100 --> 02:00:19.760]
He didn't cast a voter.

[02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:20.660]
You didn't cast a voter yet.

[02:00:22.360 --> 02:00:22.680]
No.

[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:23.200]
Hey.

[02:00:23.340 --> 02:00:24.840]
But it's the phone number to the one in the Miami.

[02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.340]
Well, we don't know, but are you going to cast a voter?

[02:00:27.480 --> 02:00:29.320]
You're just going to keep like this is 20 questions.

[02:00:29.660 --> 02:00:30.760]
Uh, I don't know.

[02:00:31.700 --> 02:00:32.020]
Undecided.

[02:00:32.360 --> 02:00:32.640]
Yeah.

[02:00:32.900 --> 02:00:33.140]
Okay.

[02:00:33.300 --> 02:00:33.740]
Good call.

[02:00:33.880 --> 02:00:34.160]
Get lost.

[02:00:34.740 --> 02:00:35.060]
Okay.

[02:00:35.540 --> 02:00:37.580]
Can't these people dial information is a vent difficult?

[02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:38.220]
I don't know.

[02:00:38.280 --> 02:00:39.920]
Like we have all the numbers in our fingertips.

[02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:43.460]
Boy, you look really wide awake and bushy tailed.

[02:00:43.460 --> 02:00:44.660]
Wouldn't you just crawl out of the sack?

[02:00:46.940 --> 02:00:48.460]
I'm still ripped from last night.

[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:49.520]
It was quite an experience.

[02:00:49.780 --> 02:00:49.980]
It wasn't.

[02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:51.940]
It was gut wrenching.

[02:00:52.040 --> 02:00:52.660]
We have decided.

[02:00:52.660 --> 02:00:54.080]
Now, I don't know how long you've been listening.

[02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:56.720]
Because you looked like you slept in late, which I also did, by the way,

[02:00:56.720 --> 02:00:58.420]
to get up to like 830 this morning.

[02:00:58.680 --> 02:00:58.980]
Really?

[02:00:59.620 --> 02:00:59.980]
Yeah.

[02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:04.680]
But now our guest celebrity here today has worked out very well.

[02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:06.460]
Got cheese fondue out there, by the way.

[02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:07.460]
Uh, no.

[02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:07.980]
No.

[02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:09.140]
You'll have some Friday down.

[02:01:09.380 --> 02:01:09.700]
Okay.

[02:01:09.860 --> 02:01:09.960]
Good.

[02:01:10.100 --> 02:01:10.360]
You will?

[02:01:11.220 --> 02:01:11.760]
You will.

[02:01:12.320 --> 02:01:13.500]
Well, he's going to be there too.

[02:01:13.500 --> 02:01:17.220]
Don't start looking down at him or you're being big trouble.

[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:18.360]
I'll mount it right up for you.

[02:01:18.360 --> 02:01:19.120]
He gets what you will.

[02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:19.720]
Yeah.

[02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:22.560]
Chocolate fondue.

[02:01:22.620 --> 02:01:23.620]
You mentioned something about that.

[02:01:23.700 --> 02:01:25.280]
Yeah, he's going to lie down in the middle of the table.

[02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:26.960]
Start naked.

[02:01:27.620 --> 02:01:28.880]
And they're going to cover him with chocolate.

[02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:29.620]
Isn't that what you said?

[02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:31.400]
That's what you said.

[02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:32.300]
That's what I said.

[02:01:32.460 --> 02:01:33.980]
Yeah, well, somebody said that.

[02:01:35.140 --> 02:01:36.500]
Have a brunette waitresses.

[02:01:37.460 --> 02:01:38.400]
Well, did you hear Chrissy?

[02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:38.960]
The fun fun.

[02:01:39.060 --> 02:01:39.160]
Chrissy.

[02:01:39.340 --> 02:01:40.520]
He's obsessed with Chrissy.

[02:01:40.680 --> 02:01:41.660]
I mean, I'm obsessed, yeah.

[02:01:42.180 --> 02:01:42.720]
But he's not obsessed with you.

[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:43.720]
No, I think you would like her.

[02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:44.860]
She's going to be there Friday.

[02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:45.660]
Yeah, she will.

[02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:46.620]
He's not obsessed with you.

[02:01:46.900 --> 02:01:47.700]
Did she have a boyfriend?

[02:01:47.960 --> 02:01:48.440]
Yes, she does.

[02:01:48.620 --> 02:01:49.180]
Oh, I see.

[02:01:49.240 --> 02:01:51.480]
And he'd like to be all I got to you say they've got a boyfriend.

[02:01:51.480 --> 02:01:51.940]
They've all got a boyfriend.

[02:01:52.220 --> 02:01:54.260]
And last night, that's the perfect proof of that.

[02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:56.080]
She has upset when she didn't get to see her last night.

[02:01:56.120 --> 02:01:57.400]
Even Dave said he's got a boyfriend.

[02:01:58.000 --> 02:01:58.660]
Just a joke.

[02:01:58.920 --> 02:01:59.880]
It's just a joke.

[02:02:00.420 --> 02:02:01.060]
Believe me.

[02:02:02.240 --> 02:02:05.120]
This guy is just pouncing on all those young ladies out there

[02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:07.260]
at the melting pot in his mind.

[02:02:07.500 --> 02:02:07.840]
In his mind.

[02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:09.240]
Okay, we got now listen.

[02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:10.400]
We got a couple of minutes left.

[02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:11.940]
And this is the pivotal moment.

[02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:13.480]
And you missed it.

[02:02:13.580 --> 02:02:15.760]
And did you see Mr. Bird anywhere in the building?

[02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:16.640]
Or is he still pouting?

[02:02:16.860 --> 02:02:17.120]
He's pouting.

[02:02:17.420 --> 02:02:18.160]
Just talking to him.

[02:02:18.220 --> 02:02:18.660]
Is he pouting?

[02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:20.700]
Well, you know, we were talking about something else.

[02:02:20.820 --> 02:02:21.780]
We were talking about last night.

[02:02:22.440 --> 02:02:23.540]
He is a wreck.

[02:02:24.060 --> 02:02:24.420]
Gizzy.

[02:02:24.720 --> 02:02:25.460]
An absolute wreck.

[02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:28.740]
He will got up and walked out of here like the most ejected foul

[02:02:28.740 --> 02:02:29.880]
in the history of mankind.

[02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:32.640]
I've never seen anything like after all that good food

[02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:33.560]
people brought last night.

[02:02:33.660 --> 02:02:33.820]
Yeah.

[02:02:34.060 --> 02:02:35.860]
And you should have seen the amount of food that showed up here

[02:02:35.860 --> 02:02:36.520]
from brick oven.

[02:02:36.720 --> 02:02:39.020]
He is just, I can't believe that he would pass that up

[02:02:39.020 --> 02:02:41.280]
so he must really be in a foul mood.

[02:02:41.740 --> 02:02:43.640]
Okay, let's take these pivotal last calls.

[02:02:43.980 --> 02:02:44.380]
Rowered.

[02:02:44.380 --> 02:02:44.560]
Hello.

[02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:46.360]
I'm going to hang up now.

[02:02:46.820 --> 02:02:47.320]
What do you mean?

[02:02:48.060 --> 02:02:49.160]
You're going to hang up now?

[02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:49.600]

[02:02:49.800 --> 02:02:51.180]
How does that supposed to mean to you?

[02:02:51.280 --> 02:02:52.000]
You're going to hang up now?

[02:02:52.180 --> 02:02:52.880]
Excellent call.

[02:02:53.500 --> 02:02:54.760]
What a beanbrain.

[02:02:55.120 --> 02:02:55.880]
Dead County.

[02:02:56.020 --> 02:02:56.200]
Hello.

[02:02:56.740 --> 02:02:58.000]
Yeah, I definitely vote for Dave.

[02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:01.940]
I'd rather listen to Jeff Striker moan than listen to the bird.

[02:03:02.140 --> 02:03:02.480]
Excellent.

[02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:03.440]
Very good call.

[02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:03.820]
Thank you.

[02:03:04.100 --> 02:03:04.880]
Thank you.

[02:03:05.160 --> 02:03:07.700]
As a matter of fact, we may make on Wednesday we may do that show

[02:03:07.700 --> 02:03:10.200]
or next Wednesday, Jeff Striker moaning for four hours.

[02:03:11.080 --> 02:03:11.520]
Broward.

[02:03:11.560 --> 02:03:11.720]
Hello.

[02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:12.720]
Hello, Neil.

[02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:13.780]
Am I on the air?

[02:03:14.100 --> 02:03:14.680]
No, you're not.

[02:03:15.860 --> 02:03:18.460]
You know, these Dr. Ruth calls, we don't need those, okay?

[02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:20.060]
Wait, did you mark the last one down?

[02:03:20.520 --> 02:03:21.020]
Yeah, right.

[02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:22.760]
Just relax.

[02:03:23.020 --> 02:03:24.420]
I got everything under control, okay?

[02:03:24.780 --> 02:03:25.240]
Dead County.

[02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:25.540]
Hello.

[02:03:25.820 --> 02:03:26.860]
Yes, sir.

[02:03:27.060 --> 02:03:27.740]
Oh, for Dave.

[02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:28.460]
Really?

[02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:34.160]
It's got to be tough walking in that studio on a one shot deal.

[02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:34.640]
Yeah.

[02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:35.640]
Here in talk.

[02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:38.120]
I don't care what anybody thinks.

[02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:39.480]
They just haven't had the experience.

[02:03:39.580 --> 02:03:40.400]
Thank you very much, sir.

[02:03:40.460 --> 02:03:41.140]
I appreciate that.

[02:03:41.880 --> 02:03:44.720]
What I'd like to know, what my secretary wanted me to ask you was,

[02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:47.060]
how do you get invited to do it as well?

[02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:48.580]
You have to look like Dave.

[02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:50.280]
Why?

[02:03:51.340 --> 02:03:52.400]
Because I said so.

[02:03:52.600 --> 02:03:53.640]
Well, power, right?

[02:03:54.140 --> 02:03:55.140]
When do you want to take a look?

[02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:56.720]
I don't.

[02:03:56.880 --> 02:03:57.560]
But why not?

[02:03:57.900 --> 02:03:59.100]
No, I can tell by your voice.

[02:03:59.220 --> 02:03:59.960]
You don't look like Dave.

[02:04:00.520 --> 02:04:00.840]
Okay.

[02:04:01.160 --> 02:04:03.040]
You look more like Dave Giroway, maybe.

[02:04:04.180 --> 02:04:04.900]
Yeah, see?

[02:04:05.080 --> 02:04:06.420]
I really appreciate that.

[02:04:06.720 --> 02:04:07.500]
Okay, that's all right.

[02:04:07.740 --> 02:04:10.160]
No, well, it turns fantasy into reality.

[02:04:10.420 --> 02:04:13.200]
Yeah, and look who they put his sidekick was at chimpanzees.

[02:04:13.260 --> 02:04:14.040]
So what does that tell you?

[02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:15.660]
Well, that's what they're doing,

[02:04:15.740 --> 02:04:17.480]
medical experiments on now.

[02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:18.020]
What can you do?

[02:04:18.100 --> 02:04:19.180]
Yeah, too much monkey business.

[02:04:19.340 --> 02:04:20.520]
Okay, listen, have a wonderful day.

[02:04:20.720 --> 02:04:20.980]
You too.

[02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:21.440]
Okay.

[02:04:22.980 --> 02:04:25.040]
Okay, the last important cause, though,

[02:04:25.140 --> 02:04:26.220]
all I think you may have,

[02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:26.840]
I think you may be safe.

[02:04:26.840 --> 02:04:27.400]
I think I got it.

[02:04:27.400 --> 02:04:28.340]
Yeah, you think you've got it.

[02:04:28.620 --> 02:04:29.620]
Don't pass it around.

[02:04:30.080 --> 02:04:30.980]
Rowered county, hello.

[02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:31.840]

[02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:35.880]
Just wanted to tell you that you really drew him last night.

[02:04:36.180 --> 02:04:36.640]
Yes, we did.

[02:04:37.060 --> 02:04:41.140]
And I'm just wondering why all the girls were hanging around you

[02:04:41.140 --> 02:04:42.560]
and all the men were hanging around Sam.

[02:04:42.900 --> 02:04:44.420]
Well, we're switching off,

[02:04:44.680 --> 02:04:46.400]
but you know, varieties of the spice alike.

[02:04:47.120 --> 02:04:49.580]
And have you been to that new musical church in Halea?

[02:04:50.020 --> 02:04:52.360]
Isn't it interesting that the neuters were all hanging around the bird?

[02:04:52.520 --> 02:04:53.500]
I thought that was fascinating.

[02:04:53.680 --> 02:04:55.960]
All the, go ahead, sir.

[02:04:56.060 --> 02:04:56.300]
I'm sorry.

[02:04:56.300 --> 02:04:59.640]
Have you been to that new musical church in Halea?

[02:04:59.700 --> 02:05:00.780]
The church of San Theria?

[02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:02.700]
El Mungo San Theria.

[02:05:04.340 --> 02:05:05.780]
The old watermelon man.

[02:05:05.900 --> 02:05:06.540]
The old watermelon.

[02:05:06.680 --> 02:05:07.480]
I remember him well.

[02:05:07.640 --> 02:05:08.660]
Did you cast a vote, sir?

[02:05:09.640 --> 02:05:10.720]
I'll vote for everyone.

[02:05:11.220 --> 02:05:11.580]
Okay.

[02:05:12.020 --> 02:05:13.640]
That's how it's said from non-committal.

[02:05:13.720 --> 02:05:15.600]
That's our favorite kind of call or real decisive.

[02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:16.380]
Thank you.

[02:05:16.460 --> 02:05:17.840]
I couldn't get near you last night.

[02:05:18.060 --> 02:05:19.080]
Well, thank God for that.

[02:05:19.520 --> 02:05:20.200]
Okay, sir.

[02:05:20.680 --> 02:05:23.400]
And our last call is from Dade County.

[02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:24.260]
This could be pivotal.

[02:05:24.560 --> 02:05:24.880]
Hello.

[02:05:25.660 --> 02:05:28.300]
Let's transplant the bird's brain into Dave's body.

[02:05:28.620 --> 02:05:28.940]
Okay.

[02:05:29.340 --> 02:05:29.680]
Okay.

[02:05:29.960 --> 02:05:31.960]
We've already got one bird brain, isn't that enough?

[02:05:33.320 --> 02:05:34.280]
Okay. Have a good one.

[02:05:34.520 --> 02:05:34.860]
Thank you.

[02:05:34.920 --> 02:05:35.800]
That's a vote for...

[02:05:35.800 --> 02:05:36.980]
Well, he wants your body here.

[02:05:37.180 --> 02:05:37.380]
Yeah.

[02:05:37.720 --> 02:05:38.800]
And we'll do the lobotomy.

[02:05:38.940 --> 02:05:39.460]
We'll do the whole thing.

[02:05:39.840 --> 02:05:41.420]
So I guess Dave's coming back tomorrow, right?

[02:05:41.680 --> 02:05:41.880]
Yeah.

[02:05:42.180 --> 02:05:42.580]
Are you really?

[02:05:43.160 --> 02:05:44.320]
Or are you just putting us on?

[02:05:44.500 --> 02:05:45.780]
Yeah, I got an outfit out to do.

[02:05:45.880 --> 02:05:46.700]
I would be crushed.

[02:05:46.920 --> 02:05:47.700]
We got a picture of the people.

[02:05:47.840 --> 02:05:48.580]
Do you understand it?

[02:05:48.780 --> 02:05:49.720]
The B for this.

[02:05:50.820 --> 02:05:51.000]
Yeah.

[02:05:52.400 --> 02:05:52.760]
Okay.

[02:05:53.220 --> 02:05:53.720]
He'll be here.

[02:05:53.720 --> 02:05:54.300]
Trust me.

[02:05:54.440 --> 02:05:55.540]
He just getting to love it.

[02:05:55.840 --> 02:05:57.600]
And I'm beginning to love it too, as a matter of fact.

[02:05:57.740 --> 02:05:57.920]
Okay.

[02:05:58.000 --> 02:05:58.800]
Mike Wolf is here now.

[02:05:58.920 --> 02:06:03.480]
He's got some headlines and then CBS minus the farmers insurance spot in position 1v.

[02:06:03.920 --> 02:06:05.580]
And then we'll come back tomorrow morning at 10.

[02:06:05.920 --> 02:06:09.060]
And listen, after a little experience, there's no telling what he might do tomorrow.

[02:06:12.380 --> 02:06:14.580]
You've been listening to The Neil Rogers Show.

[02:06:15.020 --> 02:06:19.220]
The views and opinions expressed on this program are those of the host guests and callers.

[02:06:19.360 --> 02:06:21.560]
And are not necessarily those of WIN.
