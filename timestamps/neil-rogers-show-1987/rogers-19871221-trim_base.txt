[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.300]
question sir do you know what i think the theory is i thought about this because he threw that at me

[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:55.020]
the first day i worked with uh Neil was that my last name is caprita cap thing it's that's just sort

[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.900]
of your and that's like that was my father's name too was cap so i think he got like the cap from

[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:08.840]
caprita and just cap and day just remember sir it's not captain day it's captain captain day

[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:18.280]
c-a-p apostrophe yeah there's a there's an apostrophe in there okay can you sleep well now

[00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:27.440]
now i have a little critique um when are you two at the you two concert no i wasn't were you there

[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.380]
cap day no no sir uh let's just appointing man they were lame man the concert was disappointing

[00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:42.220]
yeah the bass was 30 and and the edge was inconsistent the what was inconsistent the edge the edge

[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:49.740]
the drumming was great i mean i did enjoy where his name is well are you are you glad you went or would you

[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.880]
well glad i saw it because i never saw it before i was just gonna see them about five years ago

[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.580]
when they're a bit younger and not so commercial on it you know would this happen to be a

[00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.540]
tom moon for the mimey herald oh sounds like a it sounds like one of those reviews that you read in

[00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:11.740]
the herald i like the word you choose the the bass was rough and the dirty it didn't come out

[00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:19.800]
the ambiance the bass was dirty and the edge was rough oh i'm sorry i felt like a shaving foam and

[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:25.840]
they pay too much of the new music yeah it's so you know which is pretty you know i do you think

[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.500]
that do you think this was one of these deals where you your anticipation was just too much you

[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.300]
thought it was going to be greater than you know it actually wasn't reality the thing was that i

[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.700]
i'm that i like like their old stuff like i sing or in october you know and they yeah and they did

[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.360]
they played you know this crap from the josh or two which i hate oh i see well that's a good

[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:55.940]
arm don't you like that album that's what i does not with the was such as made i'm looking for

[00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:02.460]
something is the worst and the the song that i've heard the most by you two on the radio is the

[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:08.340]
worst you two song i've heard now now why do you think that is it's the worst you two

[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:16.860]
are for effort every you two son remember me it's the worst one is this bill a worst okay all right

[00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.480]
see you later good to hear from now we uh he was the only one everybody else that they really

[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.300]
like everybody loved the concert yeah but maybe they didn't notice that dirty bass and the

[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:32.200]
inconsistent edge that he happened to discern probably from his seat we got another memo and this

[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.960]
is not concerning us directly this is from peter and i i i don't think peter's up yet so i'm

[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.220]
going to read it says at the bottom please don't talk about this memo on the air just do the promos

[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:48.260]
you know uh so i'm going to do them from the bottom up i'll do like one an hour or something now

[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.180]

[00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:10.950]
what it is in a minute first let me take this call from bowered county hello hello hi hi how you

[00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:16.150]
okay i just want to tell you that friday at work we have by the formula on a whole bunch of

[00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:22.350]
different women there uh-huh and it came within an inch on everybody except for one are you serious

[00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:29.330]
curious it's unbelievable it's unbelievable i'm unbelievable now what you do is you take now let's

[00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:34.470]
go through it briefly all right you take the grip the you take the woman to wait and you multiply

[00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:41.890]
by what five forty nine i forty nine then you take her height subtract 10 inches right right so

[00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:49.490]
another she's five five that would be 65 inches so then you so you make it 55 divided into the number

[00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:55.210]
you got when you multiplied and then take the square root of what you got correct correct all right

[00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:59.750]
now i said it right correct and it can't he said it came out within an inch on every woman they

[00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:04.010]
tried in the office maybe we should do that to the women in our office here later today

[00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:08.450]
and then we'll give you a report tomorrow that's a thought it's no work at our

[00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:13.550]
what it did work yep well thanks for the report sir you're welcome thanks a lot

[00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:19.170]
all right bye bye all right now here's this card i found it all it says on it is 30 something

[00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:29.130]
next week on 30 something two oh i think i'm coming down with something yeah you really

[00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:33.650]
should eat something maybe later say what time is it anyway i don't know seven something

[00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:38.250]
okay how about something chinese or something Italian something live

[00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:44.730]
no something well then maybe a movie or something yeah something fun that'd be something

[00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:52.230]
30 something twos is a 10 something nine something central it's really something oh yeah

[00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:56.890]
remember that i've heard that in a long time so we're trying to clean out get this

[00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:00.570]
organized and we're finding a lot of a lot of things we haven't played in a long time that's okay

[00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:04.330]
all right riches here who helps us out you're our resident what

[00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:09.930]
mammalian mammalian he's got the computer there so someone wants to give it a shot

[00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:15.230]
on the formula you'll be more than thrilled to punch the buttons right

[00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:20.010]
I'll punch the buttons in and let the computer calculate the the breast size and if they want to

[00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:25.990]
give their actual breast size we're going to accumulate the data and even apply let's say a

[00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:31.750]
standard deviation for all us deviates and maybe we can tweak the formula a little and come out

[00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:36.930]
with a more precise more precise formula for this thing yeah you could get our first victim here

[00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:42.590]
yeah wait it says on the screen a formula victim is on brouwered one so let's see what this is

[00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:49.390]
hello hi hi how you doing this morning great are you a formula victim well i haven't considered

[00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:54.790]
myself as such until now well actually i was calling with regard to the formula uh-huh

[00:17:54.790 --> 00:18:00.530]
and as i was sitting here on hold i got to hear it spurted forth however i didn't have my

[00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:06.610]
ten in hand yet so all i've got is weight plus five forty nine and then height minus ten

[00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:11.390]
that's correct all right now now what's your weight my weight yeah hundred eighteen

[00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:16.890]
hundred eighteen oh we will put it into the computer and how tall are you five six five six

[00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:21.450]
okay we're putting it in the in the computer now that's the breast machine service

[00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:27.890]
breast machine says that your breast size should be thirty four thirty four there you go it's right

[00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:35.290]
right on the money are you serious i'm a heart attack i can't believe this is working you believe the

[00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:40.810]
one is i tell you the society we live in today isn't it amazing that right now we know the

[00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:47.310]
whole reason for all of the computers that we have well i am just amazed but i'm really kind of

[00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:51.750]
happy that it worked you know because we were having while i was trying to do it in my head you know

[00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:57.890]
last year and you know how i am what's easier to tell somebody's high weight huh oh well i just

[00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:03.930]
my addition it but it was well i can't the square root to kind of get difficult in your head

[00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:08.570]
yeah try to do square root in your head it was just like virtually impossible at least you know

[00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:14.410]
within a few sentences of conversation yeah yeah you know when you first meet somebody and you're

[00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:22.250]
trying to size it all up you know listen guys i just want to say i'm enjoying you good yeah how

[00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:30.990]
nice day thanks a lot okay well now there's there's a we tried it and it worked now we're doing now

[00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:35.790]
here's yelton over the engineer from can we call you the a m engineer we're doing a lot of

[00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:41.070]
important work here yelton yeah sure we're working on the formula you know the formula

[00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:50.450]
or if you take a woman's weight multiply it by 549 take her height subtract 10 inches

[00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:58.690]
and divide that into your number and then you take the square root of that number and you get

[00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:03.730]
her bra size and we hit just how to call her and and we do it we did it in computer and it worked

[00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:07.510]
beautifully you know some people put model airplanes together

[00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:14.430]
you figure out people's bra sizes well you're abreast of the time uh-huh and if uncle

[00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:20.390]
niel comes back and find out and finds out that this is what we've been doing on his airwaves

[00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:29.650]
we're never we're never gonna hear the end of it trust me okay just when you thought crap

[00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:32.750]
call records couldn't possibly be more tasteless

[00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:49.450]
that's right it's the cat skills cowboy himself dr. erbing paycheck singing the all-time greatest

[00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:58.570]
hits of noshville you'll hear the accountant you gotta know how to feed him know how to cheat him

[00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:05.950]
if you want to live your good life deep a second set of books and who could forget this flavorful cut

[00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:26.190]
to my soul and no collection of old country music would be complete without dr. erbing paycheck's

[00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:36.110]
dietary classic i've his coach and coach and coo yes crap call records proudly presents the

[00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:43.190]
all-time greatest hits of noshville those not my amymoo to order noshville hits dial one eight hundred

[00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:49.530]
a six-by-d dr. erbing paycheck because he's got those not my amymoo's yeah

[00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:58.170]
yeah i had the north Miami blues one time boy those are bad okay now uh six twenty eight now

[00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:03.790]
on say to cap day if it's been we um can you describe for us just exactly what we're working with

[00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:11.390]
here this is impressive this is a compact three portable computer okay it's IBM compatible it has a

[00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:16.990]
forty million bite hard drive that's a lot that's a lot okay six hundred and forty k of memory

[00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:23.730]
and it's it's got a two eighty six chip in there which means it's very fast and it only weighs about

[00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:28.450]
ten pounds and you can carry it around uh you know like a like a cylinder you are talking into the

[00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:34.390]
back of that microphone AC if you turn it around it says front on it now you see that now try it

[00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:40.050]
now let's see what we go how's that no you're still it now turn now see the see the purple diamond

[00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:45.390]
there you go that's the front okay but it did sound kind of neat it made it sound like an engineer

[00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:50.270]
yeah made it sound kind of engineering because we had the noise in the back of it anyway it did work

[00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:54.730]
is is the point uh when we tried it on the last listener and we'll see if we can give it another

[00:22:54.730 --> 00:23:00.410]
shot here this morning sometime brown county high fine good morning good morning listen is there any way

[00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:06.430]
we could take that computer um and use two pick numbers at highlight

[00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:14.450]
oh the formula if you will absolutely you get the breast size of the players but i don't know

[00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:20.750]
if you get the winner what do you say about that rich uh yes they're they're all they're

[00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:25.890]
in fact there are some programs out there that you can buy that uh that do predict the winners at

[00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:31.810]
highlight and at the track uh i haven't seen any you know i haven't tried any actually but uh

[00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:36.610]
they they just compile a lot of statistics and uh they'll probably pick at 50% of the time which

[00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:42.390]
is probably what you would do in our use series yeah does that do you think it helps at all well

[00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:49.250]
you know it's you know they sell for like fifty nine sixty nine dollars a piece and um you know

[00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:52.890]
if you're if you're into that sort of stuff and uh you know you're afraid to stick a pin in uh

[00:23:52.890 --> 00:24:01.790]
in a racing form uh you know you give it a shot um what do you think about that well i think i'll

[00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:07.370]
you're doing an excellent job in captain Dave and um i hope he'll make it back before you take over

[00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:12.990]
yeah he'll be back okay don't worry okay thanks a lot take care six thirty at the day to four

[00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:17.810]
you know i now see rich when you're trying to that mike you something before it was great when

[00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:21.630]
you're talking into the back because you had all this noise it really sounded like he was in a

[00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:27.910]
in it like in a a a laboratory you know like a lab doing my experimenting yeah high tech it really

[00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:34.290]
turn them back around yeah talking the back of the uh okay now captain Dave you were talking

[00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:39.770]
to yelton about you you are just just apoplectic this morning because you left your calculator

[00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:45.690]
at the christmas world i was in a huff to leave why i was with this really lovely lady

[00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:52.790]
it's like the first date i've had since seventy nine uh would you like to tell us who it was

[00:24:52.790 --> 00:25:03.070]
is someone we know i don't want to tell you okay um i picked up the calculator and i made sure

[00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:07.990]
that i picked it up off the table because do you remember one time at love ninety four the general

[00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:13.050]
manager gave us these little gold pins from christmas said love ninety four you put into your shirt

[00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:17.590]
no no no that's not the one remember the time he gave us the gold chain yeah i yeah by the way i

[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:23.600]
melted all of that down and i got a guy i got a couple of bucks for that remember the gold chain

[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:29.980]
sure he gave it to us we were out on the south beach location on south Miami beach and uh i used

[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:34.820]
to go to a gym on the way home in the omni that we had members use that so i got this christmas

[00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:40.980]
president of a beautiful gold chain that everybody got one at the station 30 minutes later i was at

[00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:46.120]
the gym took it off like an idiot hung it up with a locker and it was like this christmas

[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:49.900]
president was gone 30 minutes later and this is like day jade damn food

[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:54.600]
that's the exact same thing happened Saturday night man i had this beautiful christmas president

[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:59.260]
for 30 minutes and then it was gone well yelton said that you could get another one they have

[00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:03.980]
extra wins and all you'd have to do is go up to the bookkeeper and tell him that you get it for

[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:08.480]
glen yeah which means you're left out in the lurch i don't get one anyway i don't really think i

[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:12.760]
need one but uh well i don't either but they were so nice where they were at a little clock

[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:18.040]
and a little date thing on them and they were solar powered and they could figure out broad sizes

[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:23.600]
and yeah and a leatherette case oh they were in a case oh they were solar powered i like to

[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:30.840]
and a little note pad and a pen okay so if if you would like if any if any young woman uh would like

[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:35.520]
to or older woman it doesn't matter would like to take a chance we do have the computer here

[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:41.000]
now we tried one experiment this morning and it worked perfectly so all you have to do is give

[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:47.600]
us your weight and your height and all those guys here will do a really guy thing will give you

[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:53.760]
your boss as we we're just curious if it's correct or not that's all just sort of uh like an

[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:59.360]
experiment like no like i asked Friday before we left this for the weekend is there a formula

[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:04.980]
that women can get into we don't like the equivalent of this well see like nia would love as if

[00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:11.480]
we did that but um trust me we can't get into that this is the time of year when everyone's a

[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:17.540]
wee bit Irish say Colleen would you be wanting to come over to my place to help me uh wax my

[00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:04.660]
in accordance with the new FCC guidelines this station will broadcast material

[00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:10.200]
characterized as indecence only between the hours of midnight and 6 a.m

[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:15.200]
the time at the tone 12 midnight

[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:24.320]
636 i cannot find the Elvis thing we're looking through all the cards here now now here's

[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:30.060]
something that says uh something this is from Elvis Jr let's see what this is okay now that's uh

[00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:35.320]
that's that yeah this this is yeah that i know what this is

[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:38.420]
well you know we can be this is Elvis Jr

[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:45.720]
let me look and see if i can find him he was the Elvis comedy bit right what he said he was he was

[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:51.640]
like really in going here in any way he's probably why unconscious by now anyway but let me look

[00:30:51.640 --> 00:31:14.200]
anywhere

[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:49.380]
Yeah, alright. Okay, I found it. Here's what he wanted. This is the Elvis comedy tapes,

[00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:55.540]
which is something else I don't think Neil plays much anymore and that's what we're rolling for you this week alive.

[00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:01.640]
You've bought his record, you've seen his film, you've even purchased the day glow velvet memorial paintings of the gas station.

[00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:08.760]
As a true Elvis fan, you think you've heard it all, but wait, there's more. Now you can buy secret recordings of Elvis's last telephone conversations.

[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:13.960]
Yes, it's the Elvis tapes. Hello, baby. This is Elvis.

[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:19.460]
I don't want you to come over right now and make me a big peanut butter and never so much.

[00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:23.180]
I'll be using the butter and then that is the one that will give me a two with the night.

[00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:27.820]
Yo, here elders in his most intimate moments. All the piece of me a piece of me.

[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:37.740]
Yeah, this is the Elvis. Won't you bring over a couple large piles? Don't make it three. Don't make a sex double cheese.

[00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:44.160]
Yeah, I'm hungry. I'm alone. And I'm hungry.

[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:49.940]
And you'll hear Elvis reveal how he really feels about the one true love of his life.

[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:56.280]
Won't you back? Won't you back in my life, baby? And I don't do way back. Would you pick up some donuts, please?

[00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:06.160]
Make jelly cream donuts. Crullest G-Datest two. All of my baby honey glows donuts.

[00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:11.180]
Without them I can't do the Elvis tapes.

[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:15.420]
Okay, baby. Give me. Give me. Give me more. Doors available now. We in the garage doors everywhere.

[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:20.420]
I love eat. I love eat lemon. I want to do. I give a big pot of spaghetti.

[00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:25.460]
The Neil Roger show on say before.

[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:29.200]
Okay, the dolphins did win last night, Captain Dave, right? Yes.

[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:38.300]
Oh, it's a score. 2321. Okay. The redskins tried to win the game in the last two seconds with a 67 yard field goal.

[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:42.280]
And even if the guy would have been 30 yards away, he would have missed. That was a terrible kick.

[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:49.000]
Okay. So the dolphins won. Yeah. All right. Okay. All right. Broward County. Hello. Hello. Hi.

[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:52.980]
Hi. How you doing? Fine. Neil. I mean, look.

[00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:56.900]
Now it's all right. You can call me Neil. I feel honored that you do that.

[00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:02.260]
When? Yes. I went to the Melty Pot finally. Oh my gosh. How was it?

[00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:08.820]
Oh my god. It was so great. This guy. I guess he must have heard the show. Uh oh.

[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:15.620]
But he let me have all the chocolate I wanted. Are you serious? Oh my god. I mean, yes.

[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:22.180]
Oh, you told him who you were? No. But I took my sister to dinner. Uh huh.

[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:26.020]
But all she kept saying was, oh, she's a chocolate maniac. She's a chocolate maniac.

[00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:34.300]
Uh huh. She said, you're okay. Hey. I'll give you any. You want?

[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:39.600]
Uh, well now you are a chocolate maniac, aren't you? Yeah. Yeah. So you had a good time.

[00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:46.340]
Oh, I had both kinds. It was so great. Yeah. What was your favorite? What do you think you liked the best?

[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:55.640]
I don't know. How do you like the fruits? Well, whatever. I personally really enjoy, you know, um, dipping the fruits.

[00:34:56.280 --> 00:35:03.000]
Why does they hold banana? The whole banana? Yeah. An entire banana? Yeah. Oh boy.

[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:10.940]
But I was kind of disappointed there, but he let me have a hold on. Oh, you didn't want just the little I see.

[00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:19.700]
I didn't like those. Uh huh. And I was at my store the other day. And this guy was with, we were just kidding around.

[00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:26.600]
We went shopping. And this woman, she came up to me and says, because he was talking about chocolate.

[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:34.520]
And she said to me, you're the one that's always on Zeta 4. Wow. And she said to the mind, I'm five feet tall. Uh huh.

[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:40.040]
And this woman stands around five eight. And the guy she was with, I swear with more.

[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:45.960]
It's not around six foot five. Wow. And I'm like, I'm going to die.

[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:49.800]
Because she had such a stern look on her face.

[00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:57.740]
There's something in her basket and pulled out the tertiary syrup. And she just started talking to me. It's really wow.

[00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:05.440]
Um, obviously, everyone, this is the chocolate syrup lady or just chalky. Oh, or can we just call you chalky?

[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:12.780]
Chucky. She pulled out a thing. Now, tell us again, she pulled out a big bottle of chocolate of Hershey's chocolate syrup.

[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:21.600]
Yeah. At first, it looked like she was going to kill me. And then her, I guess her husband or whatever, but her name is Sandy. She listens to you.

[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:28.240]
And she just grinning at me. And she looked like, I mean, I was going to end up five feet under.

[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:33.760]
What, what, what do you think you did that bothered him so much? Just the way you thought?

[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:36.760]
But I didn't. That's just the way she looked. Oh, I see.

[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:41.620]
But she just smiled when she pulled out the Hershey's and she just started talking to me.

[00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:47.980]
Okay. We're going to put you in the computer. Just curious. See how you come out in the, in the actual computer. Okay?

[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:49.860]
Okay. Now, how much do you weigh?

[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:56.380]
135. Put in 135. 5 feet. And she's 5 feet tall. Now, let's see how this comes out.

[00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:02.320]
I don't know how you can stand up straight, my dear. He says he doesn't know how you can stand up straight.

[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:06.240]
Okay. Browseye says the computer says, I used to lift weights.

[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:15.020]
38. The computer says 38. Okay. Now, breastfeeding, you go up a couple of sizes. So that would be right.

[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:19.600]
So it is right. In other words, you're saying. Are you saying it's correct?

[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:25.060]
It's probably. Otherwise, we're 40 feet a long time.

[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:29.980]
Uh oh. Yeah. Members, she told us this last week. She's a 40-D.

[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:36.700]
There are some people that like this because I have a friend that's only 5-4. If she weighs 120.

[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:42.600]
Okay. Now, we're going to put her in the computer. Okay. Well, we're going to see what this comes out. Okay.

[00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:52.720]
5 foot 4, 120. How much comes out to 35? 35. No. No. I mean, she's big.

[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:59.020]
Well, 35 is nothing to sneeze at, so to speak. Her cup runneth over.

[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:06.080]
Oh, she's as big as me. Is she really? Yeah. Well, you guys are must be exceptions to the formula.

[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:11.020]
I don't know. Well, my whole family's like that. Oh, are they? Yeah. You inherited it.

[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:15.920]
Uh huh. And John there. Mm hmm.

[00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:20.700]
You sure? Do you know someone from she, John? I used to work there a few years ago.

[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:23.700]
You used to work at she? I was up to three years. Yeah. He was the one that invented.

[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:27.460]
Didn't you invent psychedelic days? Yeah, psychedelic Sunday.

[00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:34.180]
He invented psychedelic Sunday. That's his claim to fame. He invented the psychedelic Sunday.

[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:40.940]
Okay. Um, are you okay? How's your? How come you're up so early this morning?

[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:45.780]
I always get up early to listen to listen to us do whatever we're doing here.

[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:50.680]
Oh, I really like you. So you have you've gone against the formula.

[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:55.840]
You know, all we tried today, everyone said it's correct, but you seem to be an exception for some reason.

[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:58.980]
I don't know. I have to send a bra to you to prove it, but.

[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:09.740]
Well, oh, and Josh, somebody that listens to your show from another station.

[00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:13.320]
Right. And can I say good morning? Sure.

[00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:16.880]
Okay. I promise I won't say anything wrong. Okay.

[00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:19.680]
And tell me if I get out of line. Go ahead.

[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:28.020]
Okay. Good morning. This is the chocolate syrup lady coming through your lives through the airways.

[00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:34.540]
Yes, it's time to get up here. Around me to pull the covers off.

[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:41.700]
Oh, looks like you're already up. Well, let us go and take a shower.

[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:52.620]
Not yet. Well, just remember, when you turn on say to floor, you're turning me on also.

[00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:58.160]
Not bad. Not bad for this hour of the morning at all.

[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:04.380]
Okay. Are you okay? Are you okay?

[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:06.920]
Yeah. I think I'll, I think I'll be all right.

[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:11.160]
Okay. We'll talk to you later. Okay. Bye. Bye.

[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:16.900]
Yeah. Um, John.

[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:24.660]
Yeah. So you were a chief for three years. Yeah, like 79 to 82.

[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:27.600]
Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. Who was the PD then?

[00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:32.260]
First Neil Merzky and then Fox. Oh, sunny Fox. Sunny Fox. Yeah.

[00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:38.240]
You mean a guy? He's not. He's a guy. He's a guy. He's a guy. He's a guy. He's a guy.

[00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:42.880]
He's a nice guy though. Actually, he's not. I mean, he won't take your calls, but he's, he's pretty nice guy.

[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:49.380]
Yeah. He's been here and I met Sunny. He was on one of the AEM shows we did over the summer. He's a real nice guy.

[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:55.060]
In fact, he introduced me to the greatest chips I've ever had in my entire life.

[00:40:55.060 --> 00:41:01.100]
No, I'm not a chips guy per se. You know, I'm not really into chips, but Sunny had these wine kettle chips

[00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:05.820]
that were incredible. Did he steal those back in the old days? Boy, they were.

[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:09.740]
No, he's been most of his time at the saddle up down the street there on Davey Road. Yeah. Yeah.

[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:13.600]
That fits in with all the stories I've heard about Sunny. Okay.

[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:20.040]
647. We're gonna have to take a break in a second, but before we do, we were sort of on this Elvis thing

[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:22.600]
and we have our Christmas message from Elvis first.

[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:27.860]
And now, here with a special Christmas message, the immortal Elvis.

[00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:32.540]
All lucky, like a member.

[00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:35.600]
This here is the king.

[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:41.900]
I know I haven't been around for a while, but I want y'all to know what up here in Rock and Roll Heaven.

[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:48.680]
I'll be thinking of you, but it's Christmas. And I'd like to give you all a special Christmas message.

[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:54.520]
A message of peace. Like how about a little piece of that tie going by.

[00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:55.180]
Thank you.

[00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:55.640]
I'll go back.

[00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:01.020]
Rock and Roll slam. Christmas is a time of hoot.

[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:02.200]
Time of joy.

[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:03.600]
A time for love.

[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:07.140]
And I sure would love it. Thanks for the last speech you got there.

[00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:09.160]
I can't. I can't. I can't.

[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.620]
No more worry about it. Oh yeah, Christmas.

[00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:18.700]
The Christmas to me means family. If family means friends, the friends means getting together.

[00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:21.600]
And getting together means eating.

[00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:23.980]
I'll pass me that drumstick. Which please.

[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.580]
Well, like it. I'm going to rest.

[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:31.340]
Now, I just want to say to you right now, you know, I may be a big star.

[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:35.480]
Maybe too big, but ain't nobody's so big. You can't reach out a helping hand.

[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.200]
Or a helping hand.

[00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:40.460]
Oh yeah, hand me a helping.

[00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:42.400]
Those my data's over there. Which I believe.

[00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:44.100]
Like it. Like a remodeling.

[00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:48.620]
Now, like I was playing with. Ain't nobody so big. You can't.

[00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:50.880]
Stoop to help a friend of me over the holiday season.

[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:55.180]
Speaking of season, you won't pass me that soul-sucker when you get the chance.

[00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:58.920]
Like it. Yeah, just just those scruly cover. That's right. Like I don't know.

[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:03.520]
So let's Christmas. Why don't y'all take a tip from old A.O. Lawrence.

[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:07.080]
Now, now, I'll leave those staked-gets right where they are. You know what I mean?

[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.200]
You know, I appreciate it. Thank you.

[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:12.080]
I want you to remember, we're all part of God's great big family.

[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:14.860]
And you know, God made man into his own image.

[00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:20.000]
And look at the mirror. I have to say God must be a big, big sinner we're going to be.

[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:21.780]
You know what I mean? I like you, dude.

[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:24.780]
But I especially want y'all to remember this one last thing.

[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:29.480]
And y'all of whom is Christmas stringing that popcorn up on the tree.

[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:35.740]
Save a big, big bowl of a cane. Extra butter, what am I? I like you, dude.

[00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:37.720]
I like you. I like you. I like you.

[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:45.980]
Good morning. It's 6.49. I'm day for three down here.

[00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:48.260]
What's happening? I'd like to get my own chingles.

[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:50.080]
Is that possible to do? You're on jingle?

[00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:19.940]
I mean, for this week, baby, change the D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-

[00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:35.300]
The FAA is handling the investigation as spokesman says anyone convicted of interfering with the air safety system can get up to 99 years in jail.

[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:44.960]
A Miami schoolteacher scaled a 145-foot telephone tower and declared he would not come down unless the city gave him $8 million for the poor.

[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:51.320]
Police say they spent four hours trying to talk Norris Barker, a former US Army officer, into descending.

[00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:55.500]
But Barker responded by demanding a press conference in the sky.

[00:44:56.280 --> 00:45:04.000]
SWAT teams finally removed him from the tower. Police thanked camera crews who showed up, though the news representatives say they didn't even turn on their equipment.

[00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:09.940]
Now here's this guy in jail. What do you think he hears this on the air? He knows that he was duped like that.

[00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:18.880]
You know, why does that remind me of the episode where Beaver was in the giant coffee cup up on the billboard? Remember that episode? You don't remember that classically, but to be her episode?

[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:22.080]
This is all the way the teacher would look to me, you know.

[00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:28.800]
You know, actually I thought the fake medical helicopter crash was kind of reminding me of Beaver at a coffee cup. I don't know why.

[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:35.240]
It's down to the final week before Christmas and retailers are looking for help from Santa to boost holiday sales.

[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:44.940]
A spokesman for Kmart, the nation's third largest retailer says he expects the season to be satisfactory and not as depressed as people had anticipated several weeks ago.

[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:48.660]
Sales had flattened after an encouraging Thanksgiving weekend boom.

[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:53.360]
Really? For people like me that do their shopping 24 hours before Christmas they probably got mine.

[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:58.500]
I did mind over the weekend, Dave. It's real busy. I don't know what they're worrying about.

[00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:01.960]
I'm waiting for a couple of days. I got mine done. I'm real happy.

[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:09.940]
Well, if you're planning on doing some shopping today or this week it's going to be pretty mild. Partly cloudy and mild today with a high of 80, low tonight 69.

[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:17.020]
Increasing cloudiness tomorrow with a high of 82. The outlook for Christmas should be partly cloudy and mild later on in the week.

[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:20.100]
Currently it is 73 at 652.
