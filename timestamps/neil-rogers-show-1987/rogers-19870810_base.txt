[00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.040]
I would have needed was Donald here today and I would have just gone nuts.

[00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.860]
Now don't say his, that he gets, don't you understand he gets sexual is illiterate.

[00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:09.100]
You will.

[00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.160]
He gets sexual illiterate.

[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.800]
I know that very well with that but he gets sexual excitement whenever you say his name

[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.460]
and well good.

[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.260]
Well no I don't think he's using that.

[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:16.280]

[00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:17.900]
No I don't think he's using it.

[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.160]
I mean I'm not getting any of it as well give some of the time of the year.

[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.920]
Okay we've got guys and underwear we're going to be talking about today and all kinds

[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.740]
of exciting things.

[00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.980]
Now by the way before I get to my good friends at American cable and the cable implantation

[00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.120]
by the way is still out or at least as of 845 this morning it was still out.

[00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.460]
No.

[00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.620]
And it went out yesterday.

[00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.880]
See every time a pigeon drops something and plantation American cable can't cope with

[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.200]
it.

[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.860]
Now one day last week the sun was shining there wasn't a cloud in the sky and the cable

[00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.760]
went out for hours.

[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.260]
Okay.

[00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:51.800]
Yeah.

[00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.640]
Yesterday there were some thunderstorms in the area and I guess you said in Kendall a

[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.540]
rain hard for two hours.

[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.380]
I'll know 20 minutes by me at the most 20 minutes and the cable went out yesterday

[00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.280]
sometime between go I don't know two and four o'clock I guess and it's been out ever

[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.680]
since.

[00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.880]
No mine never went out and these pansies up there and plantation will they complain about

[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.560]
of course they can never get through anyway.

[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.580]
You never get through you get a recording and a recording says we're having an outage

[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.020]
in the plantation area we're working on it now and it'll be repaired sometime in your

[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.460]
lifetime.

[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.440]
I'm serious and then you know the interesting part of it is they never deducted from your

[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.740]
bill.

[00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.940]
I mean it's like going to be a whole day now.

[00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.220]
So a 30th of the bill like a buck or so ought to be or whatever it is 80 cents deducted

[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.080]
from everybody's bill never they don't do that.

[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.100]
If American cable took all the downtime and deducted it from your bill every month they'd

[00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.900]
be sending you a check they would owe you money.

[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.060]
That's how bad it is.

[00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.040]
I mean I've tried to be nice and I've tried not to say too much because it sounds like

[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.240]
sour grapes but when you're paying like 48 bucks a month or whatever I pay you know

[00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.320]
with three premium channels.

[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.640]
Yeah four I'm sorry.

[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.200]
I don't know.

[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.500]
Yeah you'd expect at least the set would be on and they're doing you such a wonderful

[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.340]
service because in all these buildings now they don't put any antenna system in their

[00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.220]
own and because they've got the cable they're all wired for cable.

[00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.400]
So you've got no choice when the cable goes out what do you do you put on old types of

[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.580]
racing from Yonkers.

[00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.240]
I'm tired of seeing Spencer Ross already okay I was watching Spencer Ross to 130 in

[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.020]
a morning this morning.

[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.460]
I'm sick and tired of seeing him.

[00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.400]
That's the only thing you can do.

[00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:29.400]
Old tapes.

[00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.540]
Oh movies or something you know home shopping.

[00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.220]
Home worries.

[00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.380]
Not home shopping network even nothing.

[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.740]
Zero those.

[00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.500]
No one you're upset.

[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.220]
Looks like you're in Fairbanks Alaska lots of snow.

[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.960]
Twenty four hours with no home shopping.

[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.560]
Yeah.

[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.280]
No wonder.

[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:47.480]
Well now I understand.

[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.400]
A lot of those lesbian women on the audience must be having an nervous breakdown.

[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.960]
By the way did Mike Spindell do it again yesterday?

[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.860]
Did he dazzle the audience one more time just when we think he's run out of steam and

[00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.100]
is going to hand in his letter.

[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.020]
He just does it again yesterday in the 11 o'clock hour you'll never guess what Mike

[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.580]
did yesterday.

[00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.360]
You'll never guess I give you 400 guess and you still won't guess sexual fantasy.

[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.100]
Would I ever it and Dan Slade and they couldn't buy calls for a million dollars a call.

[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.240]
No they just have three or four.

[00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.760]
One of them was Ed Berliner in mobile phone.

[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.620]
Okay.

[00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.320]
Now I was going to call in suggest that Ed should be driving his mobile phone on the freeways

[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.740]
in LA.

[00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.500]
No he's okay but nobody knows who Ed Berliner is.

[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.460]
Of course sports guy on channel.

[00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.900]
But he's a little bit.

[00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.500]
Probably the only person who does.

[00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.340]
Yeah.

[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.080]
I mean quick calling us Ed will you please we don't like you don't you understand.

[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.240]
Anyway and then of course it noon Mike redeemed himself.

[00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.020]
I want to tell us about that catch show he wants you to book next month September is

[00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.120]
National Cat Month and wouldn't you know that our little W I N Z token silly person has

[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.720]
already arranged to book a catch show in September.

[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.440]
Maybe Dr. Jan Bellows would be good.

[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.280]
We'll invite noodles.

[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.580]
Yeah we could have noodles here and Donald.

[00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:06.620]
No not dog.

[00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.880]
Yeah right here in the studio that's noodles.

[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.580]
Yeah we could have him right in the studio.

[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.320]
But anyway he redeemed himself and no I was talking last week about fasting.

[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.140]
Yeah you fasted for what he had he did he had a doctor.

[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.560]
Hey it was an ice guy but very extreme.

[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.200]
I mean they didn't talk about fast.

[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.520]
Yes they did why fasting is dangerous.

[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.020]
Did you learn anything the reason it was dangerous is because I suggested it say that they

[00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.580]
didn't say that.

[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.220]
But you should have heard the calls I heard just a few minutes of it and I was just

[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.440]
in heaven.

[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:41.520]
How loud that I haven't had a VM in five years.

[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.480]
They don't float or sink.

[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:55.220]
It was great it's just what we want here at W I N Z those 99 year old living dead.

[00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.440]
I forgot about the float and sink lady we should have her by yeah just for you know 15

[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.100]
minutes or so.

[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.840]
Bring her in today I'm ready I'm leaving any minute.

[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.060]

[00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.160]

[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.620]
You're out for days.

[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.000]
I was really pretending and the audience was delighted.

[00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.520]
Okay let's see all those people in the audience who are upset that the bird is back today.

[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.360]
Let's see a quick show on the phone.

[00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.400]
They're going to knock the phones just about we might we might blow the whole phone

[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.840]
and then we'll be in real trouble and not like that.

[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.720]
Not not not.

[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.120]
