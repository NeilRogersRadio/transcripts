Sullivan's voice was coming from me you white bitches are all alike

[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.300]
rinquist teasers i was being used by the adjective it was not me he wanted

[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.580]
beautiful and vulnerable as i am know it was a white woman that he wanted to

[00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.920]
humiliate he wanted to avenge wounded knee in my body at that instant i fear the

[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.560]
lad lost my sympathy if not my interest as he started to rip at my dress i gave

him my special giant moth karate blow to the belly he doubled up unable to breathe

[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.960]
then a well-earned twist and push coordinating right shoulder with left leg dropped

[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.020]
him to the floor with the crash before he knew i've hit him i was seated on the

[00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.980]
small of his back with his left arm twisted behind him so that the slightest

[00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.860]
pressure of my forefinger on his wrist would cause the most excruciating pain

[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.080]
christie grunted what the burger do you think you're doing protecting myself

[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.280]

delicately i pressed my forefinger on his wrist and was rewarded with the

[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.740]
help stop that only if you promise to be a good boy what are you some kind of a

[00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.660]
freak a lady wrestler or something he looked at me over his shoulder for the time i

[00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.940]
detected the beginning of fear but i had have no desire to hurt him i want only

[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.400]
to rebuild him in my own image i also knew that if i were to frighten him too much

[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.540]
you would never return foolish goose i gave him a sweet smile i just learned a few

[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.800]
little tricks to keep from being all must up by purse natures and by rapists

[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.560]

myself comfortable on his firm rubbery buttocks he looked remarkably appealing

[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.020]
with his head twisted around so they could see me like the new moon over his left

[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.560]
shoulder the straight black hair all tounseled i noticed that in our scuffly it

[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.040]

[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.320]

let's see which half he stared at me blankly with my right hand i took his

[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.640]
ankle and bent his leg back so that the large square foot in its dingy white sock

[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.800]
was almost level with my eyes i peeled off the damp sock

[00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.900]
what are you doing he tried to straighten his leg but pressure on the wrist made him

[00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.240]
change his mind he groaned then shuttered as i examined the calloused all-appointed

[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.880]
soul of his foot looking to see what color you really are dark he's have pink

[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.240]
souls i ate no nigger he muttered no but the bottom of your foot is lighter than

[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.900]
can imagine if taffy's listening this was quite true he was not literally a red

[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.640]
skin more light brown with yellowish tint so i noticed that the hairs on his ankle

[00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:00.540]
were sparse black and fine come on he said and veris as i playfully tickled his

[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.340]
toes let me up let's call it a day i'm sorry what i did

[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.380]

[00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.500]
i stopped let's see if you're too toned everywhere i reached under him and got his belt

[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.160]

[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:22.000]
him scream darling there must be no secrets between us i changed my position sat on his shoulder blades

[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.860]
you're breaking my arm he wind i was also pushing his jeans down to his knees with my foot

[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:33.940]
he wore no underwear the smooth coppery buttocks glistened sweatily in the bright clear of the single

[00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:39.520]
overhead Mazda well well i said significantly well well what he squeaked nervously clenching his

[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:45.220]

my glancel come in here if we say jingle although at present his musculature is typically masculine i

[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:20.140]
could see how once his male organs are removed and his system fortified with female hormones the

[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:25.940]
broad pelvic region would be truly ravishing absence of unsightly hairs on his back except for

[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:32.500]
a single black tuffed at the beginning of the anus is also a definite plus looking down at what

[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:12.560]
i'm not you know that you're not a guy you don't know what it's like to have these kind of

[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:18.700]
genitals there's hormones surging through your body yeah but anyway i mean it's just

[00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:24.680]
we don't sit around just dwelling on six for six sake it's about a man's psyche we're talking

[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:28.500]
what do you know i'm going to say the word penis on here okay pants there you got it i didn't change

[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.660]
i mean what do you want for me what do you want me to do now now you guys want me to use the

[00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:36.100]
effort just run a tape of the radio i have a couple questions really i just have in my crew in here to

[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:40.700]
ask them uh what i'm not interested in what you think of the definition the new definition

[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:47.120]
the new definition of what's in decent i mean the definition is scenes pretty broad i think

[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:52.320]
hacking a girl's arms off um tapping her arms off leaving her by the side of the road to die

[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.120]
then going to prison for for only eight years and coming out is obscene that's what i think is obscene

[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:02.060]
but if you look at the i don't know you want to plot it i'm looking at it you're not a buying

[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:06.840]
this one if you look at the new definition now i mean it's a really wide definition look at this

[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:12.040]
you're going to read it what is the new definition uh what's in decent be language or material that

[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:16.720]
depicts uh in terms patently offensive is measured by contemporary community standards

[00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:23.740]
sexual or ex-scritory activities or organs and that's a lot ratter it covers a lot more things than

[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:29.220]
the second-degree words man i don't know doesn't make any sense to me like uh it's

[00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:34.820]
that constitutional that's what i want to ask you on camera oh camera i said i don't want to do all

[00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:43.680]

[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:45.860]
you guys have to be all the time anyway i'm sure to you not you personally i don't think you're a very

[00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:49.380]
nice person but just the industry you're in anywhere you come on you know you come in here

[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.820]
so you're gonna come on what are you gonna get to the sex so now i gotta sit now i

[00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.980]

seven years or wait a year if i do it again i do this isn't going back at CNN

[00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:13.560]
so look at that 57th treat i had some bikini girls with me yeah to make photo

[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:17.900]
grep the bikini girls had nothing to do with the show nothing to do with the show

[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:22.840]
just i like to travel with girls and bikinis okay that's my little hang up that doesn't have an

[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:30.460]
everyday exactly we marry the cat like two or three wives didn't i i guess i don't i like to

[00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:35.000]
travel with bikini girls if you got into bikini maybe i got your camera for you

[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:41.520]
what's that stuff you have now is that an attack on women and it could be that's a sexual thing

[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:48.280]
oh that that isn't relevant that's not what's thinking about cops on women

[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:53.080]
good luck and we got what's thinking about

[00:19:54.320 --> 00:20:00.880]
because dangerous every thought worth thinking about say hi y'all when children bet so

[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:03.600]
oh

[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.000]

[00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.400]
can i have you do you date any different then

[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.340]
listen to the back on when Larry King does an interview listen to him in the background

[00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:19.520]
you got to hear this right are you concerned that the stern of animals gonna be once

[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.660]
let everyone know he's still breathing yeah just like you know the big heart attack

[00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:24.520]
she's like in the back but this isn't me strong

[00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:26.300]
you know

[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:31.740]
just take this out though it's very subtle do we lead to i'm just saying something

[00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:33.600]
tomorrow at WNBC can lose his license

[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:38.400]
yeah i'm just gonna say i'm a says and said anything where anyone could lose your license for the past 15 years

[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.320]
they're hoping he says something make people listen

[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:40.780]
yeah

[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.400]
and just like anything that's creative

[00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:50.540]
uh i'm not gonna try to in any way get into that i'm as his kid

[00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:54.220]
oh that'd be interesting oh boy i'd like to do that

[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.540]
yeah let the girl wouldn't

[00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:04.800]
but i am concerned as i said before to use a cliché that is up there if you i think i've

[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:09.040]
worked in radio a lot i know a fair amount of our radio management i think without a

[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:13.500]
snutter warning coming down there'll be a considerable shift phone management

[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:18.800]
dealing with people who are less let us say independent and don't say to match it

[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.000]
and i'm gonna get a lot of it

[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:30.740]

yeah i think i showed this on TV then i let you uh

[00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:54.340]

[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:42.420]
thinks about the new nba basketball team huh wonder she's going to be hanging around there in

[00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:46.900]
liberty city can you just see that it's probably got her season tickets all right it wouldn't

[00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:52.120]
that be great if she got all her white friends to buy up all of the season tickets for the arena

[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:56.580]
that would be real interesting and then of course once that happened they'd have to move all

[00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:00.680]
the residents to the area to some other part of town like maybe maybe they could swap maybe

[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:04.460]
all they can move all the black people to brick a lavenu in those nice buildings and taffy and

[00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:09.080]
all her white folks could move into liberty city and overta you know all the tenement buildings

[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.420]
you know what they say what goes around comes around where did we hear that i think sandy should

[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:19.460]
that is it sandy yeah yeah it was very profound that was right after she had the tv repair man on

[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:24.340]
and he was asking about that volume dial and kept saying what goes around comes around

[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:30.260]
anyway is there anybody in the audience who was up did we have any complaints any hysteria now

[00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:34.880]
i mean wasn't lesbian dilatated but it was uh there was some pretty wild stuff in there

[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:41.020]
i think probably that was a real good example from a news standpoint not only in terms of the

[00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:46.820]
first amendment the discussion in the FCC but also in terms of Larry King yeah that was very

[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:51.420]
apropos pretty soon Larry's going by by in this market isn't he yeah nobody has picked that show

[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:58.920]
off and now you can understand why uh next month uh it gets early May i think like May 4th he'll be

[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:05.320]
gone yeah right yeah yeah why don't write him a check that's what we all should do we should also

[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:12.660]
and Larry a check and see if he'll cash him for us no chance no way hoze so what do you make of all of

[00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:16.640]
this this was a pretty uh momentous day you ought to be in hog heaven because you're the big

everybody's getting involved in the campaign and that's great and we've had a real positive input

[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:13.720]
here but we have to do everything kind of like a stuffy way because we don't want to have too much

[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:18.860]
fun right management gets upset if they perceive that we're you know having too much fun

[00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:24.400]

[00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:29.480]

[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:34.040]
there and uh concert i'm curious do you think there are people in this audience who even understood

[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:39.400]

[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:31.640]
nil roger's a t.u. it really doesn't matter and that is that it seems to me that the fantasy of

[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:37.840]
allyson one the land has finally come true because everything seems to be upside down if you know

[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:43.760]
i mean it's just unbelievable you know in the in allyson one the land uh people didn't put

[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:49.100]
necklaces on necklaces put little people on and it seems to me that what's called conservative

[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:54.920]
today is really just the opposite because if it truly was conservative then they would be up

[00:36:54.920 --> 00:37:01.060]
in arms as soon as there'd be any attack on constitutional guaranteed uh right right and

[00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:08.760]
and on here anybody screaming about uh rights violations or limitations except for the who

[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:17.020]
who supposed to be anti uh constitutional rights such as uh libertarian type people and uh

[00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:25.360]
and it seems to me that what is passing off as uh conservatism is just a notsy fascist religious

[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:33.520]
fanatical type people amen who uh who aren't satisfied with anything else but bringing this nation

[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:40.580]
through the state of iran pre uh chomeini to the point where maybe we'll have blood in the streets

[00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:45.520]
maybe we'll have this kind of disorder i don't know what they're looking for but it seems to me

[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:51.720]
that they want to make major changes in this country and if your blood and my blood has to run

[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:56.620]
in the street then that's fine with them they're going to have their way king george is going to be

[00:37:56.620 --> 00:38:03.520]
back on the throne and the revolution is going to have been taken in vain okay and of course as far

[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:10.120]
as being on the throne is concerned um uh twenty five past one at w and z i want to tell you

[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:13.640]
something i just found parts of the building that i didn't even know existed and it's a good thing

[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:22.160]
i found them i'm really concerned about the fm boy am i concerned i run out of here and i go to the

[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:28.560]
what would you call it restroom but the regular yeah restroom yeah what the minthroom

[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:36.360]
and they're having like an fm staff meeting in there in the bathroom in the bathroom well i mean uh

[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:44.180]
and in the stalls and i'm very nervous when you go into a restroom restroom and there are a whole bunch

[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:49.260]
of guys converting around in there you know what i'm saying was the consultant in there and somebody

[00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:56.320]
one of them was seeing glory hallelujah i'm serious then i look up in the front at the executive

[00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:02.100]
john up there and the doors closed and all of a sudden my life is flashing before my eyes and i

[00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:07.320]
thought how can this be see that was one of the nice things about being here at night yeah no

[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:12.040]
problem i'm sure that kyle remembers a couple of times at night even with guests here when they all

[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:16.600]
of a sudden in the middle of an hour you know when nature just uh was going to have its way right and

[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:21.100]
we put on a couple of psa's and i flew out of here and you know but there was nobody here so you

[00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:27.000]
didn't have to worry about that but during the daytime man look out so i luckily you told me about

[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.540]
that the hidden bathroom and the bathroom in the back there that looks like something out of the

[00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:36.780]
dark ages although you know looks are not what counts that's right as long as the plumbing works man

[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:40.160]
that's the only thing that really uh that you care about i didn't know that was back there either

[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:47.520]
that's hidden away ron Harris and uh budwaw back there with a little shower the carper goes

[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:54.360]

extracurricular eggs very well putzer for a big trouble now yes now that they're going to have live

[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:13.520]
models and underwear commercials on TV yeah that means someday we'll have live condo models on TV no

[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:20.360]
down that's the next step but what's really obscene is a new state gun law yes me uh they really

[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:25.900]
just pushing it too far and then they said uh well we'll let each county decide on a waiting period

[00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:31.140]
why don't they just let each county decide on the whole issue well far as i'm concerned is i

[00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:35.520]
said before it's a lost cause and it just it's not even worth talking about i mean you know i think

[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:40.000]
at this point that everybody got to go out and buy a gun and uh that you know the gun is not what

[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.520]
it's all about it's the people the people in this country are irresponsible it's got nothing to do

[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:53.080]
with whether i mean look at this maniac last night are you serious oh god well we finally got one

[00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:48.360]

[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:55.420]
lot of things uh patently offensive if you're in the if you're in the armed forces the uh you're

[00:41:55.420 --> 00:42:00.340]
certainly not able to turn off the commanding officers cursing and all sorts of other things that

[00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:05.440]
they say which are far more horrendously over here on Howard's turns program anyone has

ever been in the air force of the army of the navy knows that the uh or in the marine but don't

[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:14.260]

[00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:18.720]

[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:22.580]
it and said you know why i saw your sister and she was the best piece of AI i've ever had in my

[00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:25.620]
life talk about patently offensive and try turning him off

[00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:38.720]
yes sir go ahead oh uh i wonder if they're gonna start bringing any criminal charges against

[00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:44.300]
enlisted people probably uh i guess you know people like general once more and have enough

[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:47.680]
enough of that stuff behind them to put them away for the rest of their lives

[00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:56.600]
they care no okay sir was that a good call i'm not sure i'm out either i was uh sitting here

[00:42:56.600 --> 00:43:00.240]
pondering and i wonder what i have to call former admiral point what does he know is he a rear

[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:06.180]
admiral can we say that on the air i think he is they demoted him didn't they yeah he's a rear admiral

[00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:14.300]
you know what that means don't you hollywood hello yeah hello nil yes uh hey listen i'm behind you

[00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:19.160]
a hundred percent on a so far campaign that you had this petitioned right as far as that goes

[00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:26.600]
but i'm just wondering if we're not uh it did you ever give any thought our illegal the

[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:32.340]
constitution and the bill of rights says very clearly congress shall make no law abridging

[00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:37.420]
the right of first speech it doesn't say a few laws it doesn't say a couple of laws it doesn't

[00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:42.920]
say more than one law it doesn't have an asterisk it says they shall make no law abridging the right

[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:51.200]
of free speech or they free exercise of religion period and along come these self-appointed moralist

[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:58.380]
and censors and they decide what that's supposed to mean and when you start monkeying around with

[00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:02.300]
our most basic freedoms who the hell knows what it's going to be next you know we we keep saying

[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:07.020]
an over and over and over again and i still have the sinking feeling that the people who ought to be

[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:12.140]
the most scared by it who've been through it before these are going to be the last ones to respond

[00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:17.060]
because they're totally confused about the issue the issue has nothing to do with words that you

[00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:21.500]
think are vulgar it has to do whether the government can continue to censor and repress

[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:27.900]
free expression because if it's words this week about sex or organs next week it'll be words

[00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:32.700]
about the president or politicians and the week after that it'll be something else that we can't say

[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:40.020]
it's 152 at W.I.'s you better not get too excited because that might stimulate some internal

[00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:42.280]
activity here we'll pause and come right back

[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:51.060]
and if your talk show host is a lemon they're going to take care of that too so stick around for

[00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:55.280]
that now we discovered today if nothing else we discovered why they haven't been talking on the

[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:55.860]

[00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:06.620]
