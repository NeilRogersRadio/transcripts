[00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:01.540]
The

[00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:01.900]
The

The

[00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.620]
The

[00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:04.720]
The

[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.040]
The

[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:05.600]
The

[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:05.600]

[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.100]
The

[00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:06.400]
The

[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:06.760]
The

[00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:09.280]
The

[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:09.420]
The

[00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:09.840]
The

[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:09.840]

[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:09.840]

[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.120]
The

[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.040]
The

[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.040]

[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.020]
The

[00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.020]

[00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.020]

[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.040]
The

[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.300]
The

[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.300]

[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.300]

[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.300]

[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.300]

[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.300]

[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.300]

[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.300]

[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.300]

[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.300]

[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.300]

[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.300]

[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.300]

[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.320]
The

[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.320]

[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.320]

[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.240]
as

[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.740]
GB

[00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:25.840]
And

[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.820]
with

[00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.860]
When the shadows will be sore, I'm just waiting to be able to sign

[00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.220]
We'll ride the wheel

[00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:48.980]
We'll ride your show, send a show, we'll ride the show

[00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.200]
There we go, I don't think, just walk me

[00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.500]
I'm just waiting, I can see you

[00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.780]
I can't wait to sign

[00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.840]
We'll ride the wheel

[00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:15.620]
We'll ride your show, send a show, we'll ride the show

[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.120]
This is the very last day

[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.220]
I was going to play that by Peter Paul and Mary did it to start the show

[00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.260]
I brought in a Peter Paul Mary album from the house

[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.960]
Little groggy when I left the house

[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.720]
I sat down to put it on the card

[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.580]
It was great, the intention was good, but it was the wrong album

[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.460]
The very last day is not on there and you didn't get to hear it

[00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.340]
That's the way it goes and that's an omen for what kind of a show it's going to be today

[00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.740]
But we do have a lot of people who only listen on Saturday and can't listen during the week

[00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.640]
So I guess probably I should tell them that this is my last show on this radio station

[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.360]
I'm going to restrain myself, I'm not going to get excited about it

[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.660]
I'm going to be over-enthused about it

[00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.220]
And Monday morning, now how do we explain this in a way that they can relate to?

[00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.540]
Because the audience seem to be very slow during the week

[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.400]
Monday morning, I'll be on Zeta 4 at 94.9 on FM

[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.040]
6 to 10 Monday through Friday every morning no more Saturdays

[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.000]
This is not only my last show on WINZ, it's my last show on Saturday

[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.680]
Which is a lot more important to me

[00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.020]
Ever, never again

[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.720]
That's our battle cry, never again

[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.280]
And so basically that's it and of course the bird will be over there

[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.720]
We fought tooth and nail but we still had to take him

[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.040]
And Lee Gillette will be on the show this morning to butcher it up a little bit

[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.560]
And that's going to be it and we'll be doing a talk show

[00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.660]
Not going to be playing 18 in a row or 20 in a row

[00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.680]
It's not going to be a music intensive show

[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.320]
Every now and then to pacify the program director will play a record

[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.880]
You know like maybe once an hour and that'll be it

[00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.420]
And I did hear all of those words of doom

[00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.180]
Boy you know once you walk out of this building

[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.380]
All of a sudden they turn on you

[00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.700]
Even Stan turned on me

[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.720]
Oh yeah, he's going to have trouble with those phone numbers

[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.860]
He's going to be really rough

[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.020]
And you know I just couldn't believe it all these

[00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.160]
Wow I'm not going to go out buy an FM for him

[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.660]
I'm not going to buy an FM

[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.980]
All these guys with their cheap company radios

[00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.060]
I got news for you and not only will you go out and buy an FM

[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.820]
But you'll be listening to it religiously

[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.100]
You'll be getting up an hour earlier

[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.220]
Then you ever got up in your life before

[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.060]
So if you can protest all you want

[00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.400]
But starting in a few days you'll be you'll finally break in

[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.980]
You'll need your fix and you go on you buy your FM radio

[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.540]
It's really pretty pathetic when you hear guys like that

[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.400]
Because everybody has got an FM radio

[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.560]
I mean even little kids have FM radios

[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.500]
You know so all you big spenders out there

[00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:42.720]
Good luck to you

[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.840]
I heard about four calls in a row

[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.760]
And I left here on yesterday

[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.100]
And I just couldn't believe it boy

[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.220]
The minute you all were not going to buy an FM

[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.640]
Good luck to him

[00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.340]
Good luck to you you know what I'm saying

[00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.980]
So anyway we're just going to kind of reminisce a little bit today

[00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.120]
We got some of the old stuff from the past year

[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.860]
That really kind of touched the hearts of people all over South Florida

[00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.500]
Like Helen Dale Vice and Wasting Away in Helen Dale

[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.740]
And we even have something a little special

[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.020]
Maybe on a play it now

[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.740]
We only do this on very special days on this show

[00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.920]
Okay but this is also remember the so far campaign

[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.100]
And our desperate attempts to fend off the FCC

[00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.620]
And Portland main and all these other lunatics

[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.760]
It's only on Paris special days ladies and gentlemen

[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.840]
That you get to hear this

[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.260]
We'll never hear this on a sandy patent show

[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.460]
You can go to the bank on it

[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.320]
Talkin' what are we gonna do?

[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.660]
I say talkin'

[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.880]
We are all being screwed

[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.120]
I say listen

[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.500]
Why is this happening to us?

[00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.680]
We want the FCC to get our our butt

[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.720]
Talkin' there's no place for us now

[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.300]
Even DJs are all down in the mouth

[00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.500]
You can listen

[00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:02.320]
But now you won't find any words that will tear up your mind

[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.440]
No fun to be felt or by the FCC

[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.000]
No fun to be felt or by the FCC

[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.500]
There's nothing left

[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.780]
For us to enjoy

[00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.980]
We'll soon be playing with children

[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.000]
For us to be felt or by the FCC

[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.400]
No fun to be felt or by the FCC

[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.480]
There's nothing left to be cleaned

[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.320]
They think they know what we should feel

[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.740]
They try to dictate to us what is real

[00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.540]
Young and old

[00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.180]
These listen to us I say young and old

[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.920]
Please don't put up a bus

[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.080]
Help us petition

[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.700]
The FCC but you must help us with one thing

[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:49.380]
You'll be a real Roger

[00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.600]
Can't do it for myself

[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.120]
Let's help him

[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.340]
Don't put it up on the shelf

[00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.520]
Let's be FCC

[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.940]
No just how you feel

[00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.400]
And maybe we'll get the sunshine

[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.280]
So are we, Phil?

[00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.960]
FCC what are you doing to us?

[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.100]
FCC what are you doing to us?

[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.380]
Are we waiting to offline?

[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.140]
In fact they might lie

[00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.440]
Because of the FCC

[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.180]
You want to ban what we can do

[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.940]
FCC you ban what we can say

[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.720]
You've even tried

[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.320]
You ban the record

[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.560]
That the teacher's name

[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.580]
People I am talking to you

[00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.760]
I said people

[00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.100]
Let's stand and fight for what's true

[00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.280]
And you're a letter

[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.340]
Into so far so we can tell the FCC

[00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.720]
What the end of us they are

[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.360]
Neil Roger

[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.760]
And so far I'm sorry

[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.440]
People we have nothing too hard

[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.880]
Young and old

[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.160]
Get your opinions out and maybe the FCC

[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.720]
Will stay out

[00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.400]
FCC in the morning now

[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.920]
And the evening now

[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.880]
No one knows what worst

[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.920]
Right now we're saying

[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:23.680]
We are the FCC to let us see

[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.440]
Go away

[00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.360]
Get off our backs

[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.940]
FCC let us live our lives

[00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.480]
For real

[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.940]
A performance that will live in infamy

[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:41.760]
Angoli

[00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:43.360]
Thank you Marlon

[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.060]
Marlon Bailey of course found that somewhere in a trash can

[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.620]
And brought it in

[00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.440]
Marlon was a big part of the last year

[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.000]
We had our ups and downs with Marlon

[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.020]
And we provided a lot of laughs

[00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:54.000]
And a lot of heartburn

[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.300]
A lot of grief, a lot of jackets

[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.200]
Oh yeah it's been quite a year

[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.080]
So we're going to just kind of reminisce here today

[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.940]
Talk to some of the usual Saturday missfits

[00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:05.920]
And there shouldn't be too many complaints today

[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.720]
Because generally on Saturday we get this crap about

[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.800]
You got to keep working Saturday because we can't hear you during the week

[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:17.000]
Because we're in school, we're working, we're doing important things during you know those midday hours

[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.920]
And now that you'll be on the morning everybody here on Saturday ought to be an ecstasy

[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.860]
We shouldn't get any more of this crap like we had yesterday all of these

[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.400]
Confused people

[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.700]
What are you only going to be on Monday?

[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:27.900]
What Monday?

[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.140]
Boy they are a little slow out there folks

[00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:34.960]
But we do have a couple of guys that the management has hired with sandwich boards

[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.940]
We're going to be walking the beaches some very heavy promotion

[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.260]
Going to be involved in this change

[00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:43.480]
And I guess I should mention that Jay Michaels is going to be here starting on Monday morning

[00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:48.040]
Let's see Monday through Friday from 10 to 2 on AM right here now

[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:52.360]
And like the real sucker that he is Saturday morning from 6 to 10

[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.480]
You know it's not bad enough Jay that you agreed to do 6 days

[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.420]
But 6 to 10 on Saturday morning

[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.680]
I mean you got to be kidding, a real masochist

[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:03.920]
And I think you're like Jay

[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.500]
We all like him and we wish him good luck

[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.220]
And our numbers in Dade County we're just going to play a real mellow here today

[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.920]
You know what I mean? Like get it over with already in Dade County 6 to 4 9400

[00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.520]
And Broward 5 to 4 9400

[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:21.620]
I do want to caution you in advance that someone we all know and love has threatened to come in around noon

[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:28.400]
And well I guess he wants to give his last cacles and before speaking of last cacles how could I forget?

[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.880]
We also have another change on wins

[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.260]
You know we have this great summer book so we figure we'll screw up the whole station now

[00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.980]
And we have a big change coming Monday morning from 6 to 10

[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.940]
I guess this is going to be my competition now

[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.900]
And a little new wrinkle in the news business

[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.860]
And we thought we'd give you a little bit of preview here

[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:48.760]
For those of you Arlene Ross fans who are waiting salivating at the mouth

[00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:50.860]
Okay we'll try one more

[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.020]
I'm a swim carry one

[00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:02.400]
Bring another person director to have a game with you

[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:12.360]
A little preview of Arlene Ross and Michael from the new Monday morning news show here on wins

[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.920]
You'll never be any bad news even in plane crashes

[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:28.520]
Ten car wrecks, instant fatalities, drug wars, nuclear bombings

[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.180]
There'll always be a little chuckle in your morning when you listen to the news on wins

[00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:37.720]
So that's a little preview of what's coming up on Monday and I think what we ought to do by this take our first break

[00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:43.260]
Those of you probably have moral wins logs for today show at home those of you who keep track

[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:47.360]
And you want to frame this probably have a golden framed

[00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.360]
And they know save it for posterity

[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.600]
Ten eighteen at the end

[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:53.620]
What's that?

[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.920]
Could you say freeze major Miami vice your under arrest?

[00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:00.440]
Freeze major Miami vice your under arrest pal

[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.260]
Thanks Don I love you

[00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.040]
Yeah right you dummy

[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:09.060]
Twenty one past ten at W.I.N.C. and of course the dummy will be in from two to six this afternoon

[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.060]
And the Stan is going to be talking about his ratings this afternoon

[00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:17.240]
And he ought to to be honest with you I hadn't realized it because I was busy basking in my own ratings that is

[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:23.960]
But that for one that he got in the afternoons the biggest number that this station's had an afternoon in a long time

[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.620]
That's a big number in afternoons drive just in case Stan doesn't know it

[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.900]
And of course some guys who are making enormous amounts of money we don't want to mention their names

[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:38.300]
But you know the gigantic egos with their two six I mean let's get serious mobile

[00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:39.480]
Hey Neil

[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:45.280]
Hey you hung on I can't believe it very trick one man what a great American you know the commercial I deliver that on my mobile

[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:52.280]
Sorry I'm on the bike head north I'm up around Palm Beach now and I don't know it as mobile phone kicks out after certain times

[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:57.700]
On your new mobile phone you got a hands-free job or you got it yeah I got a hands-free job yeah

[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:04.060]
That's a real trick I'll tell you you know people look at you like you're out of your door though when you sit in their laughter

[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.260]
And no phone in your hand they think man this guy's got a problem

[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.820]
Yeah well with me they figure you know I'm just practicing for the next show so it doesn't bother me

[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.240]
Well congratulations on your move I'll be listening then you know that's gonna be rough to lose you in the afternoon

[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:21.980]
But I guess I guess I can get you see yeah but you sound like an early riser what time you get up in the morning

[00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:26.320]
I get up really I'm on the road but I just got a little I'm gonna miss having somebody in the afternoon

[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.200]
Because I'm in my car all day long you know

[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.900]
Yeah well what do you mean miss somebody in the afternoon what about Stan he's not going anywhere

[00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.760]
What time Stan doesn't come on to later though

[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.460]
Yeah how about the new man what do you think of him?

[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.980]
Jay's gonna be good right trust me

[00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.980]
Okay congratulations on the move thanks a lot

[00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.840]
Okay well he had a good the car phone didn't he that sounded good

[00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:48.140]
As opposed to some of those cheapos you know where it sounds like they're calling from the moon

[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.160]
23 past 10 and winds north Miami good morning

[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.020]
No yes sir I get doing bad

[00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:58.640]
Okay listen I need an education real quick on these rating systems

[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:02.520]
Yeah what exactly did it let you have a nine share or ten share

[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:09.040]
This time yeah I don't know seven five seven for now what now what age group is that that's like a twelve plus figure

[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:14.080]
That's everybody twelve plus so this guy sounds a little knowledgeable now twelve plus as soon as he says that

[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:19.220]
Now I don't know I have to ask you a question how do I agency that average title is normally by

[00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:24.380]
They buy 25 to 54 generally and I had a seven in men and women 25 to 54

[00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:28.280]
Which is about probably the biggest number in the history of this radio station

[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.080]
So we're very proud about that

[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:36.720]
That's it now where are you like how many did you were your number one in what in the 25 54 no

[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:41.940]
Where are we number three I think well you got to understand this counts like WQBA

[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:47.880]
In fact if anybody wants to see these things and see the incredible way that the Hispanic community fills out their diaries

[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:54.560]
It's unbelievable I mean the length of listeners have once they start listening if you believe them they never turn it off

[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:59.280]
I mean they're just a glued in there on QBA and our HC but now we did very well

[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:06.760]
It did three now who is number two number two what are you writing a book or what I mean I do have all of this but I'm sure the audience

[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:14.200]
Who's out delivering you there well let's see number one in 25 to 54 was waxy they did very well they had a good book

[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:15.780]
And number two

[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:22.240]
Number two listen if we got long enough I'll find it I haven't have any idea who is number two

[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:26.600]
Oh here it is life life life

[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:33.100]
I thought they have all those old listeners don't I take that back life was number one and waxy was number two and 25 to 54 and I was number three

[00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:39.560]
Gotcha yeah alright but of course life nobody listens to life they just when you get trapped in the elevator you listen to it

[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.640]
Yeah that that that the radio doesn't work that stations of no

[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:50.400]
But all right big guy want to know what was going on with the rating system okay we we done good it done good listen you have a good life

[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:55.800]
Thanks you too pal for a lot of Dale hello good morning hi how are you great great

I'm Ellen you be Ellen yeah man I be Ellen why does I'm working today well so am I so we both be Ellen yeah

[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:12.080]
But I'm kind of happy about it because this is my last Saturday ever they will never ever do this to me again if they try to do it to me again I'll become very religious

[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:24.160]
Oh really why because Jews don't work on Saturday I'm just working for no reason I don't work today

[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:28.480]
Me too me too absolutely that's why I felt every Saturday for the last year

[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:37.600]
Listen we're calling from the world great as company really looking for a free plug probably right no okay no free plug

[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:50.180]
All right good that's very nice my name is Terry okay are you are you going to be listening Monday morning Terry yeah on Zeta yeah great it's already on there excellent

[00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:58.020]
So we've got two radios one on yours and one on Zeta now you're talking yeah and you can listen to the one on Zeta and pretend you're listening to the one over here

[00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:13.880]
Right okay Terry it's great hearing from you yeah you have a good weekend bye bye nice what a nice lady it's 27 past 10 at W.I.N.Z do want to remind you by the way those of you groupies out there that stand and I will be eating at the melting pot around midnight tonight

[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:25.860]
Of course they close them at night but now sometime this weekend we will be eating there I'm not going to give you the time because we're tired of some of the groupies who just want to come around and claw at the end of the table you know

[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:36.540]
We'd like to be friendly to everybody but enough is enough and when you're having that kind of a meal you want to be left alone to sit there and salivate and enjoy every last drop of that white chocolate

[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:46.280]
and the cheese and sit there and watch Dave stick his finger into the grired cheese and just add that extra touch that makes it so sensational

[00:16:46.960 --> 00:17:05.960]
Papano hello how are you doing all right congratulations on all your success thank you and I know you'll do well at Zeta and in fact you know with the ratings that you've been talking about it seems like a lot of people in this market included including the media seem to feel like it's only in the last year that you've had good ratings

[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:35.940]
yeah what do they know we see when you're on at night you're buried like nobody pays any attention to you well you know the fact of the matter is I know when you were on W snooze you had double digit ratings at night and well even at the beginning when that station I think at a 5,000 watt signal which you couldn't even hear and then when you moved to W I and Z at night I mean you know you were managed to take the whole audience with you yeah with our big night time signal that goes almost all the way to Pemberg Pines with an unbelievable signal yeah you can say that again in fact where I live we picked up the

[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:59.860]
day we picked up I think W m a C better than we did I and Z yeah that's the station to make and do I know about nine forty I know yeah but uh you know getting back to I want to get back to Zeta for a second now I kind of hope that you do very very well so that maybe about another year from now they'll really make a change and make an F M talk around of it well you know there's an interesting pattern that takes place and that is when I first came here

[00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:05.980]
Shortly thereafter, I was really hot to try to do midday to go on the daytime because I felt that you know

[00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:12.020]
They were wasting their time with the all news, which is kind of a passive format in most markets and the word was

[00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:18.060]
They will never ever never take news off during the daytime on w. I. N. C.

[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.860]
And you saw what happened to that right yeah, and we proved it with the numbers

[00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:26.140]
Then the word was that they are committed to music on Zeta

[00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:31.360]
They will never put talk on FM ever ever they will never do it now Monday morning. We're gonna do it

[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:36.180]
So the more they deny that they're gonna do something the more I'm confident that it's gonna happen so you know

[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:41.340]
Yeah, but I like to see you give some of these people a run for their money because you know as far as morning f

[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:47.180]
Fam is concerned the only one that I think that has any degree of being a radio person is Bill Tanner

[00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:52.120]
Yeah, Tanner and the guys on hot 105 Dan McKin Jim Skyler. They are really funny

[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.500]
They're work hard and they're creative and they do a lot of funny stuff

[00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.620]
No, Tanner had music that I could listen to I'd listen to them

[00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:01.480]
But you know, I know he's a talented guy. Well, that's why when he called in yesterday

[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:02.080]
I said

[00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:08.380]
Hey, we're not really competing because you're playing all that scratch crap and you're appealing to ethnic young ethnic people

[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.460]
And you know, that's not our audience so we're not competitors

[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:14.660]
Yeah, and the reason I said that is I hope mostly keep sending all that stuff over you know

[00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:20.620]
Exactly well good luck Neil. Thanks a lot. We'll be listening. Thanks. Okay, bye 10 30 right on the nose

[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:22.980]
It wins his little clammy in here is in my imagination

[00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:29.780]
See no, it's not clammy. It must be me. Okay. Well probably I'm flushed from all the excitement and everything you're cold up there

[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:30.820]
Are you cold?

[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:36.920]
Luke warm, but not cold now it maybe just a couple of degrees

[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.200]
You know what I'm saying when you get a chance Bob

[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:43.520]
So don't pay listen, that could say 60 and it could be a hundred degrees in here that doesn't work

[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:49.040]
That's like they put that in there to lower you in a will fall sense of security, but it doesn't do anything trust me

[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:53.820]
This studio has been kind of interesting they built this some two years ago

[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:59.340]
May is that right or no three years ago may three years ago may

[00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:05.920]
And it's a beautiful studio. It's probably one of the best anywhere in the business not not just in this market anywhere in the country

[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.720]
It's a magnificent studio and

[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.620]
One of the good things of it is that you can kind of dim the lights

[00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:14.520]
You don't have to look at anybody which is very good with all of this space age equipment

[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:20.180]
Most of which doesn't work, but it looks great, but I will say this we've never quite been able to get the air

[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.660]
To work right in here either it's like freezing in fact

[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.480]
We have some guests may they rest in peace

[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:32.640]
Who didn't quite make it through this show in fact Jack or Kimer almost you know got into outer space for real one night on this show

[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.920]
Because it was a hundred degrees below zero and

[00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:41.280]
Then once in a while when a guest would come in we didn't like we would you know make it very cold because doesn't bother me

[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.860]
I got enough insulation it could be 20 below it doesn't bother me

[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.580]
And it's never quite arrived now. I'm looking forward

[00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.820]
I'm very anxiously looking forward to finding out how the air works up front

[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:57.180]
I have a feeling at that end of the building it probably works a lot better because all the management people sit up in that end of the building

[00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:01.400]
So probably it works a lot better Sky Lake mall hello

[00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:09.820]
Neil hi, I've never listened to FM and you must help me to find a station that you're going to be on well

[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:17.200]
The FM that says from 88 to 100 that's FM frequency modulation. It sounds so much better doesn't it in stereo?

[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:22.740]
That's where you're going today right on that band and it's 94.9

[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:28.500]
Now I have tried every station this morning is nobody that talks no, well, they're not doing talk

[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.880]
They're playing music right now. They've been playing the Beatles all morning

[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:37.940]
But how do I know that it's 94? I don't have 94 I have 90 well because you'll hear my voice

[00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:43.460]
You sure? Well, if you don't hear my voice then you got a pretty lousy radio

[00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:48.220]
You must have when it stops like a 90 or something. Oh, I have a stand. You know, it's very good

[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:51.220]
Well, then believe me. I mean Zade is a hundred thousand watts

[00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:54.660]
It'll come in so loud and you'll say that's that crazy Neil right there

[00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:57.460]
I ain't before point nine and you're not crazy

[00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:01.600]
Right in the matter of fact you'll hear this cackling sound in the background then you'll know who it is

[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.400]
Which I love now there's one other thing yes

[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:09.160]
Any possibility that you might change your hours to a little later

[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:14.020]
On the program. Well, what would be good for you? Well, I think around nine

[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:21.340]
They won't get enough of you in that morning. I don't get up that early. Yeah, well you might get up a little

[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:23.540]
10 no

[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:38.380]
Oh

[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:44.020]
Start going to bed earlier

[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:49.020]
Listen me to I'm talking I'm not you know, I'm getting up there, but I'll tell you

[00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:51.220]
Yeah, but you still don't welcome me

[00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:57.940]
All right, listen, I welcome everybody who wants to listen to this show everybody if they're nine or 90

[00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:00.940]
But anyway, I'd stand would say if they're nine

[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:03.780]
I'm not good at this

[00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:06.800]
There's a place I could call you

[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:11.880]
So you can help me again. Yeah, I'm terrible on all right if you got a pencil

[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.860]
Yes, all right right down this number

[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:15.820]

[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:17.900]
940

[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:24.540]
9.0 and Monday morning when you get up as soon as you get up just call in the world chat

[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:30.980]
No, when at nine o'clock I'll be on whenever you get up. Oh

[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:35.320]
You mean that's the number you'll be getting calls on right? Oh fine, okay?

[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:42.720]
Okay, I wish you a lot of luck and I'm often sorry that you're leaving me. Well, not me. Well, thanks. Thanks a lot

[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.400]

[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:51.460]
Okay 1035 see that's what they said at night. Oh, we're so upset that you're leaving the night time

[00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:53.640]
You know you're gonna regret it and I don't regret it

[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:57.280]
I wouldn't work nights again for all the tea in China. You got to be a maniac to work at night

[00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:01.220]
Look at all the good stuff you miss like going to bed early in

[00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:03.100]
This town

[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:10.620]
Yeah, right Miami. Hello. Hi. Hi. How you doing good? That's gonna be a high telephone call to follow

[00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:14.560]
I know that was a classic. I hope we have that on tape somewhere that was

[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:20.600]
Make a nice little little spot for you. Yeah, well first. I want to congratulate you on your move to FM

[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:24.520]
Thank you. I like the part where she says six o'clock. That's too early. I should start

[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.740]
I should just take that out and start playing that on the air

[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:31.180]
It's a holy macro. Yeah, of course. You know it's gonna happen in rush hour now

[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:35.600]
But he's older ladies are gonna have car accidents when he hears some stuff you can say good

[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:39.020]
Keep them on their toys. That's why they're gonna take metro rail

[00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:44.900]
I wonder I wonder if my show will be allowed on metro rail. You know they don't allow spam on

[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:48.660]
Metro rail. Yeah, yeah, I eat it only I guess. Yeah

[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:56.780]
Just as long as you don't cover it with spam really that's true, but you know something I was I was listening you on AM at work and

[00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:00.540]
That from 10 to 2 made that time at work. Oh, by so fast

[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:05.320]

[00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:13.180]
You know it's a bit of a change and I won't have to get up a little earlier, but I can make the sacrifice good and also on

Unfortunately, like I say, but yesterday morning. I don't know if you heard this on on pal Joey show

[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:19.700]

I'm gonna be listening to Neil and he called her an ass and hung up and got very upset

[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.040]
Very upset. I can't imagine

You know and he doesn't have a lot to lose you know what I'm saying in other words

[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:55.320]
He can't afford to lose anybody at this point

[00:29:55.900 --> 00:30:03.120]
The other thing on your lead in today. Yeah, that song that was the I don't know if you realize that it's the four seasons

[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:06.520]
That's a four seasons song. What's a four seasons song? They

[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:12.720]
You know what was it the song that you when you first started and you played a stick and then you played a song

[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:19.900]
About your thing on Neil Roger. Yeah, that will let's to take off on on the other one on Joey's song

From the W. Y. N. C. Hall of Flame ladies and gentlemen at 18 before 11

[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:50.880]
And we want to send this out for that wild fig of the in Halendale sunny Rosenberg

[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:52.740]
He's

[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:56.120]
Making

[00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:03.140]
All of your folks after the mom

[00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:09.120]
Checking

[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:14.620]
No, they never say please

[00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:18.860]
Just waiting for the early bus

[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:38.720]
Can

[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:48.840]
Need confusing

[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:48.860]
For

[00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:49.420]
And

[00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:47.900]
man

[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:26.940]
And once they are seated, they get overheated.

[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:33.300]
As that stuff in roses we're lovin' at best.

[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:41.280]
Wasted away, I can't even go to heaven.

[00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:49.460]
Looking for that long, long spot of view.

[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:59.340]
And how did I say that it's all the truth is a day?

[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:05.360]
But for some, an enemy in the blues.

[00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:16.640]
The whole folks don't know the reason why nothing is freezing.

[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:22.480]
But muscles ache and the teeth just don't fit.

[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:32.480]
But what does it matter when they call up kneeling chatter?

[00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:39.840]
I hate you kneeling, never listen to your show.

[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:47.360]
Wasted away, I can't even go to heaven.

[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:55.400]
Just to fight the metal musil and the radio.

[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:05.580]
And how did it claim that it's the dark homes to play?

[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:11.660]
But near no, they can't wait for the show.

[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:21.660]
And how did it claim that it's the dark homes to play?

[00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:30.360]
But near no, they just can't wait for the show.

[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:44.640]
Get my regards to the Neil Rogers, tell me, but I've never heard of smuddy or program in my life.

[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:46.360]
14 before 11 at SWINZ.

[00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:49.880]
And if you've got something to sell, boy, we've got news for you.

[00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:53.460]
Oh, I just can't get over that. I'm never going to be the same.

[00:34:53.460 --> 00:35:00.180]
Okay, let's take our last break now and we'll come back and get some more great record breaking calls on this final Saturday of our lifetime.

[00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:05.700]
Pretty a WINZ, Neil Rogers, with the TIL2 stand will be a long stand-a-man from two to six.

[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:11.240]
And this is our last show on WINZ. Believe it or not, if you're joining us late, tough luck.

[00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:16.460]
Okay, do we have a celebrity caller here? Hello? Hello?

[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:17.900]
Oh, hi Neil.

[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.660]
I told you it's Gilles Siegel.

[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:20.560]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:21.680]
Gilles, how are you?

[00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:28.120]
How fine, thank you. I want to thank you, your station and all the boys from helping to come to the commissar site.

[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:31.680]
Well, it's our pleasure. They're doing a wonderful job down there, Gilles.

[00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:34.420]
Did you see the wonderful article in today's harem?

[00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:35.420]
About what?

[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:41.960]
At the southern bell, workers donated 1,500 boxes of clothing to the commissar site.

[00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:42.480]
Excellent.

[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:43.780]
It was in today's paper.

[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:45.980]
Well, we haven't heard from you at a long time, Gilles.

[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:49.900]
Yeah, I know. I got a two-year-old. I'm taking care of now.

[00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:50.680]
Oh, yeah.

[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:52.000]
I'm coming down my first time.

[00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:52.620]
Oh.

[00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:54.260]
And I'm not sure she's not in tune up.

[00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:54.720]
Wow.

[00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:56.160]
From 102.

[00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:57.900]
Pardon me, sir?

[00:35:58.440 --> 00:35:58.880]
102?

[00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:01.040]
Yeah, so I call it my two-year-old.

[00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:02.160]
Boy, oh, boy.

[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:10.100]
I've been here my first time and I, I, it's the, the thought you're wonderful guys and all the radio shows and TV's.

[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:17.440]
I figured I did all I could and, and you know, with, with them trying to move somewhere and nobody had had them.

[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:21.180]
So it's, it's really rough, you know, for the Camilla's house now.

[00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:22.220]
Right.

[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:25.880]
So, so hoping, you know, hoping, you know, everything can come out.

[00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:28.720]
So, but I'm, I'm doing another little project.

[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:36.240]
You know, a lot of people that they, they think they're, she and I, and they think they have all time a disease.

[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:39.780]
And all they need is, you know, they're hard at hearing like I am.

[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:40.260]
Yeah.

[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:44.380]
So, what I'm working on is trying to get the hearing aids.

[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:47.500]
You know, free hearing aids for, uh, great.

[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.500]
So that's what I'm working on now.

[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:50.700]
You have a beautiful day now.

[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:51.980]
You too, Gail. Thanks a lot.

[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:52.440]
Bye-bye.

[00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:53.420]
Nice shared from you.

[00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:57.200]
By the way, Stan is going to be here mid days on Saturday.

[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:58.220]
I should have mentioned that too.

[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:02.520]
He's going to be moving up a J-Michael to be six to ten and Stan will be on ten to two.

[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:05.760]
Which, you know, a little longer weekend a chance to get out and really do some damage.

[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:07.560]
Uh, okay, that's enough for that.

[00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:08.400]
Holly would, hello.

[00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:09.600]
Hello, Neil.

[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:10.020]
Hi.

[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:10.620]
How you doing?

[00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:12.160]
I'm a little nervous, sir.

[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:13.560]
I've never been on the radio before.

[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:14.180]
But nevertheless,

[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:14.940]
only kidding.

[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:17.280]
You know, like the pledge, sixteen quarter hours.

[00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:21.160]
You notice how the, uh, demographics are starting to move up already.

[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:22.300]
I haven't even left yet.

[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:27.820]
Okay, I got a thing here for you.

[00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:30.140]
Okay, for all of the people, can't listen to you, you know,

[00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:32.160]
and you know, certain time slots.

[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:32.880]
Yeah.

[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.820]
What we can do, you can go on for twenty four hours.

[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:35.440]
There you go.

[00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:36.340]
One day a week.

[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:37.140]
I would do it.

[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:37.780]
I like that.

[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:38.720]
That's for you, Neil.

[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:39.060]
Yeah.

[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:42.780]
Okay, is the berg going to come out my left tweeter or my right tweeter?

[00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:44.980]
Uh, well, that remains to be seen,

[00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:48.100]
but what I cautioned everybody to do is get up as early as possible on Monday

[00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:49.120]
and tune it in immediately.

[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:52.920]
And then whichever speaker that he's coming out on, you can just kill that speaker.

[00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:54.360]
You know, the balance switch.

[00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:54.720]
Right.

[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:57.940]
All you people have got stereo radio is just to turn it in the opposite direction.

[00:37:57.940 --> 00:37:59.220]

[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:02.200]

[00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:02.240]
public service for the audience this morning he's been giving previews of the new format uh that's

[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:07.100]
coming up on Monday morning and uh I think he's done a magnificent job I must commend you I never

[00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:11.180]
really thought you had an in you to do such a good job but uh if I didn't know better I would swear

[00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:16.020]
that Arlene was in there somewhere maybe she is maybe the ghost of Arlene is haunting the news booth

[00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:19.900]
but uh he has done a spectacular job all morning law

[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:38.640]
I'll stick around because in the next hour it's part of our final show on AM we have some

[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:44.460]
special prizes we're gonna be giving away first is an all expense paid trip to Jamie and Marcy's house

for Ville Parmesan dinner

[00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:15.340]
it's 1107 at w.i.nz and hour number two the near Roger show hitting new lows in the

[00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:23.120]
history of broadcasting on a Saturday morning our last show on wins of course this

[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:28.240]
boat is pretty good for some of those AM programmers in the market right like the Bill McQueen show

[00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:33.660]
Bill of course has talked about setting new lows has really done it in the summer book

[00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:38.060]
and that was mostly before Sandy went over to W snooze so what's Bill gonna do in the next

[00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:43.280]
book that's the question and of course Jeff Charles who came into the market with his surfboard

[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:49.880]
and all of his seaweed that he eats and all that artsy crafty a moronic mindless crap he's really

[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:55.120]
done it you know he has really lifted that station to new lows seldom seen in the history of broadcasting

[00:45:55.120 --> 00:46:00.920]
so we want to congratulate the people over WNWS who by the way are rapidly evaporating from your AM

dial and are real good friends the ones that everybody love in town WIOD where and I want I want to

[00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:12.480]

[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:18.140]
herald and if it's in the herald you know it must be true he said these changes are final

[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:25.520]

[00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:06.480]
pretty unusual on to be on 10 I'll say what I was calling about is all these station managers what

[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:11.520]
are they gonna do on the FM side when you come in with these high ratings without giving away

[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:17.760]
a hundred thousand dollars to the bride the viewers to listen to listen to them well I got to I

[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:22.420]
have a very good suggestion because it's still not too late let's see there are about four or five

[00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:26.200]
of them that are probably real nervous now they would kick in about a hundred thousand of peace

[00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:31.220]
and just give it to me I'll just retire you know I'll just gracefully take off for a couple of

[00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:34.920]
years and uh I'll get out of their hair you know oh they would like that they would like they may

[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:39.760]
have matter of fact they may be considering that okay I'm ready but I don't have to wish you a lot

[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:44.680]
because you're pro and uh the others need to luck you just have it all thanks a lot you you do it

absolutely I would just like to make one suggestion yeah don't do it I won't be angry but eight

[00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:34.040]
weeks ago this past Thursday you had the ultimate talk show call of all time around one o'clock in

[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:38.680]
the afternoon on your station and I think you have it on card even though you've never played it

[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:44.400]
was a call where the guy um said I'm nervous and I've never called the talk show before and the

[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:49.540]
long one on for about 15 minutes that's all that's a lot more than eight weeks ago that's about uh

[00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:54.920]
that's months ago well if there's any way to wait a minute there's a number of calls already

[00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:04.160]
before but no I was stuck in ninth and all in the road for 25 minutes in the car really I was the

[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:09.260]
most fabulous thing I ever heard I know and uh just for that call alone I appreciate your program

[00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:14.080]

you got uh let me see all the numbers I never called the

[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:25.880]
already before but no other that is a classic and he didn't even realize it they never do that's

[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:29.800]
when the classics come in when they never even realize it now listen buddy if you haven't sold

incredible I've lived here for 35 years and you're the most exciting person on the radio

[00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:06.740]
since Larry King oh boy unfeelingable yeah you can say that again yeah anyway I think that you

[00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:12.340]
should try to negotiate with south Florida um as it relates to the increase in the gross

[00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:16.640]
national product of south Florida because people gonna have to wake up earlier to listen to you

[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:21.100]
and they're probably gonna get more work done yeah a lot more productivity in the workplace yeah

[00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:25.220]
that's right you know uh and between ten and two they probably gonna get some work done

[00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:31.720]

[01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:32.440]
i know Glenn probably didn't say this or i wrote you so if there's a kung fu episode on two nights

[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:38.060]
ago with dawn johnson oh my favorite yeah really yes it is absolutely the funniest thing i've

[01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:42.660]
ever seen it was on midnight to one in the morning i was rolling on the floor laughing hysterically

[01:17:42.660 --> 01:17:47.900]

is this on so midnight to one in the morning i couldn't get to my vc art at tape it yeah that's a

[01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:08.520]
having connections believe it's worth it yet to never let stand get his hands on it because those

[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:14.580]
ribs are the shreds yeah it's a it's become a relatively famous episode is it a cult yeah

[01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:18.560]
yeah the funniest thing i've ever seen you can see dawn johnson talking in broken english

[01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:22.680]

[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:48.980]
okay excellent really good i i've never had anything there that wasn't sensational i mean

[01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:53.140]

My baby's slipping away.

Into a blithy of age once again.

[01:37:56.940 --> 01:37:58.120]
Daddy's slipping away.

[01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:02.680]
You're likened up there in December in Buffalo, Jodi.

[01:38:03.900 --> 01:38:05.460]
Six feet of snow on the ground.

[01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:08.720]
Wind chill of about 2018 below.

[01:38:09.660 --> 01:38:12.320]

Okay, let's take a call from Boca. Hello.

[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:39.080]

Good, are you paying for this call?

[01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:41.420]
That's a certainly out.

[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:43.880]
Wow, and I see on Monday you won't have to do that anymore.

[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:44.960]
We have a Boca line.

[01:38:45.180 --> 01:38:48.200]
Oh, I know. And I hate, why, and how are you doing?

[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:50.880]
Chronic. Would you like a slice of pizza?

[01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:52.860]
This is a candy.

[01:38:52.940 --> 01:38:54.160]
Can you say kinky?

[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:55.980]
I watch at the brick oven.

[01:38:56.800 --> 01:38:58.320]
Is this our chronic collar from Boca?

[01:38:58.700 --> 01:38:58.900]
Yeah.

[01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:01.260]
Oh, I shouldn't have told him about that then that Boca line.

[01:39:01.420 --> 01:39:01.960]
Well, it's for you.

[01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:04.700]
Well, I haven't even called you in about three weeks, okay?

[01:39:04.700 --> 01:39:07.200]
Oh, yeah, sure. Tell me another good one.

[01:39:07.740 --> 01:39:08.720]
It's a truth, okay?

[01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:12.380]
Yeah. Are you, this guy must be related to Martin Luther King Jr.,

[01:39:12.380 --> 01:39:13.080]
he had a dream.

[01:39:13.660 --> 01:39:13.780]
Yeah.

[01:39:13.780 --> 01:39:15.800]
In your case, I think it was a fantasy.

[01:39:16.340 --> 01:39:18.860]
Did you talk to your buddy Steve Kane about his ratings?

[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:21.120]
Steve, talking about my, you can.

[01:39:21.380 --> 01:39:21.740]
Your pal.

[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:24.700]
I pal, Steve Kane? No, I don't, I don't talk to Steve Kane.

[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:25.460]
I talk to Mike Miller.

[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:27.280]
Oh, now you're talking. Yeah.

[01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:27.920]
How's Mike doing?

[01:39:28.020 --> 01:39:28.620]
How's Mike doing?

[01:39:28.940 --> 01:39:29.480]
He's doing well.

[01:39:29.660 --> 01:39:31.220]
He loves his West Palm Beach a lot now.

[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:32.940]
Yeah, hey, Mike, he likes it.

[01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:34.660]
He's hanging out with Daffy.

[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:38.280]
But he's, he's doing well up there.

[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:40.340]
He's having a great time and he's, uh...

[01:39:40.340 --> 01:39:43.740]
I heard that he's starting a petition drive to bring the dolphins to West Palm Beach, is that true?

[01:39:44.140 --> 01:39:46.420]
He's trying to bring the Minnesota North Star.

[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:48.200]
Oh, yeah, that ought to be good.

[01:39:48.540 --> 01:39:49.660]
Stanley Cup playoffs for Cup.

[01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:50.040]
Excellent.

[01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:51.260]
Off Florida, it's gonna be great.

[01:39:51.540 --> 01:39:53.200]
Good. Hockey is so big in Florida.

[01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:54.160]
Yeah, yeah.

[01:39:54.460 --> 01:39:55.060]
Like in L.A.

[01:39:55.480 --> 01:39:55.700]
Yeah.

[01:39:56.100 --> 01:39:59.600]
But, uh, by the way, I think I'll boom a quagg with also on that Elvis is a North court.

[01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:03.020]
Very possible.

[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:05.800]
Could be. He's trying, he's sniffing around to get us to play it.

[01:40:06.020 --> 01:40:06.220]
No.

[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:07.580]
No. Good, because we're not.

[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:09.060]
Oh, did you watch Blue Velvet?

[01:40:09.540 --> 01:40:13.920]
No. I turn on the movie channel for spasming out on the last one.

[01:40:14.020 --> 01:40:14.680]
I couldn't watch it.

[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:14.920]
Really?

[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:18.680]
Yeah, it's just about the part where the year was deteriorating in the woods.

[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:19.540]
Oh, yeah.

[01:40:20.180 --> 01:40:21.860]
I told you it was your kind of movie.

[01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:25.600]
And then it went crazy and I just had to turn it way up to here and...

[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:29.500]
Well, it's understandable with the movie that it would start spasming out.

[01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:30.140]
As you say.

[01:40:30.260 --> 01:40:31.080]
National pastime.

[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:34.520]
I'm trying to conjure up in my mind the movie channel spasming out.

[01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:36.440]
You know, it's an interesting event.

[01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:38.400]
Well, that's it. No, you got it backwards. That's a new movie.

[01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:40.900]
It's going to be on the movie channel spasming out.

[01:40:41.700 --> 01:40:42.060]
Right.

[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:47.460]
With the Sissy Spaceck and the Melio Esquiz spasming out.

[01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:51.520]
Well, you know, central type with all the greats and...

[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:52.360]
And near greats.

[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:56.200]
Can you tell me why isn't Bill Calt are going to be on WINZ instead of...

[01:40:56.200 --> 01:40:58.680]
I hate listen, because do they ever do anything here that makes sense?

[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:01.740]
Do they ever do anything here that makes sense? No.

[01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:03.740]
Did they move to the FM? That makes sense.

[01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:07.100]
Well, no, I'm not talking about that. But I mean, you know, that wasn't...

[01:41:07.100 --> 01:41:08.420]
That wasn't in that part of the building.

[01:41:08.620 --> 01:41:10.480]
And only took them a couple of books to get rid of Daffy.

[01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:12.780]
Yeah, and that was under great duress.

[01:41:13.660 --> 01:41:15.020]
Yeah, they weren't happy about that.

[01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:16.700]
They weren't happy about letting her go.

[01:41:17.460 --> 01:41:18.580]
Well, I know. Well, anyway.

[01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:22.940]
Oh, by the way, and if that maniac that called Stan yesterday just before the numbers came out of you...

[01:41:22.940 --> 01:41:22.940]

[01:41:23.700 --> 01:41:24.340]
Sour nasty.

[01:41:24.340 --> 01:41:27.500]
Speaking of Daff-Rude, right-wing douchebag called in.

[01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:30.460]
And I don't know why he's upset with Stan, because Stan is even more right-wing than he is.

[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:33.420]
But, you know, Stan had a 4-1. That's a big...

[01:41:33.420 --> 01:41:35.220]
That's a big afternoon number and...

[01:41:35.220 --> 01:41:38.180]
Far bigger than Daffy had even when I had that nine shares.

[01:41:38.340 --> 01:41:40.780]
She had like a three-six in that book and standard of 4-1.

[01:41:40.900 --> 01:41:45.000]
And I guarantee you when the hour by hour comes out, he's going to just pulverize the number she had.

[01:41:45.220 --> 01:41:47.100]
So, you know, we'll never hear from that guy again.

[01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:49.220]
No. 4-1 with all that all-in-or stuff, too.

[01:41:49.420 --> 01:41:50.200]
Yeah, a miracle.

[01:41:50.900 --> 01:41:52.360]
Actually, and without your leading first.

[01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:54.540]
And with that six o'clock hour in there bringing it down.

[01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:55.880]
Bring that baby dad counts.

[01:41:55.880 --> 01:41:56.880]
The six-hour can.

[01:41:57.020 --> 01:41:58.480]
7-7 in that 4-1.

[01:41:58.540 --> 01:42:01.340]
Yeah, we won't have to lift her that anymore now that she's on in the morning, so that'll be good.

[01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:02.660]
Bring that baby down, Arlene.

[01:42:04.260 --> 01:42:05.640]
So, she got the book that had a...

[01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:07.140]
I would do...

[01:42:07.140 --> 01:42:08.620]
I would have fixed it all in the eye, I would have...

[01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:09.840]
I would have fixed it all.

[01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:11.020]
Come on.

[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:12.860]
I would have fixed it all.

[01:42:13.180 --> 01:42:13.940]
You know, it's interesting.

[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:16.420]
I don't think there's any weekend stuff on here.

[01:42:16.500 --> 01:42:17.480]
Now that you mentioned that.

[01:42:17.940 --> 01:42:19.720]
I mean, Mark Cune gave me numbers that haven't been invented.

[01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:20.820]
Look at all this stuff.

[01:42:21.260 --> 01:42:23.080]
This must be like a going-away present.

[01:42:23.300 --> 01:42:24.180]
Page after page.

[01:42:24.180 --> 01:42:25.700]
Okay, now it just has the total weekend.

[01:42:25.860 --> 01:42:26.220]
It doesn't...

[01:42:26.220 --> 01:42:26.520]
Well, let's see.

[01:42:26.620 --> 01:42:27.420]
What do we do on a weekend?

[01:42:28.740 --> 01:42:29.760]
I'd have got only those.

[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:32.840]
If I took the time to find that, it would be two o'clock already.

[01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:34.260]
I got that birch call.

[01:42:35.460 --> 01:42:36.960]
Oh, yeah, he got the call for the birch.

[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:37.500]
But did you really?

[01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:39.500]
You want to know at the end.

[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:41.380]
How much soda you drink?

[01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:42.560]
Birch beer, yeah.

[01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:45.960]
How many glasses of soda you've had in the last week?

[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:46.700]
Really.

[01:42:46.860 --> 01:42:48.380]
Well, they figured that affects your brain.

[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:52.560]
So then they wait the ratings based on how many glasses you've had.

[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:53.380]
Well, look at that weekend.

[01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:55.240]
We had an INZ at a 4-1.

[01:42:55.680 --> 01:42:56.180]
Mm-hmm.

[01:42:56.620 --> 01:42:58.900]
NWS had a 2-9 and IOD a 2-5.

[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:00.520]
So we must have done very well on the weekend.

[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:02.640]
I don't have the breakdown, but we did very well on the weekend.

[01:43:02.940 --> 01:43:04.320]
They all brought him up for me like a 2.

[01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:06.420]
It did real well with Doug Young, you know?

[01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:07.200]
Yeah, he's good.

[01:43:07.300 --> 01:43:07.860]
He's my favorite.

[01:43:08.100 --> 01:43:09.300]
If you've got anything to sell, boy.

[01:43:09.420 --> 01:43:11.580]
Okay, listen, have a great life and we'll talk to you on Zeta.

[01:43:11.780 --> 01:43:12.180]
Go ahead, I'm on.

[01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:12.980]
Once in a great while.

[01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:13.500]
Okay.

[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:15.280]
You get to see nothing to sell today.

[01:43:19.420 --> 01:43:19.980]
Nobody's buying.

[01:43:20.140 --> 01:43:20.540]
That's a problem.

[01:43:20.540 --> 01:43:21.080]
Yeah.

[01:43:21.460 --> 01:43:22.500]
Merrill Mark, hello.

[01:43:22.740 --> 01:43:23.400]
Hi, Neil.

[01:43:23.700 --> 01:43:24.420]
Hi, how are you doing?

[01:43:24.780 --> 01:43:25.900]
I love your show.

[01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:28.480]
I'm having a problem though.

[01:43:28.620 --> 01:43:32.420]
My husband and I are among those people who don't have FM in their cars.

[01:43:32.580 --> 01:43:33.080]
Oh, come on.

[01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:37.260]
Now listen, I want you and a lot of other people, you know, it's not really that expensive.

[01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:41.460]
The head for sound advice, the response of ours this weekend and go in and say, look,

[01:43:41.620 --> 01:43:44.780]
I don't have a ton of money to spend, but you know, just an inexpensive radio.

[01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:47.420]
And in a couple of hours, you know, we all said probably an hour.

[01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:49.060]
How much are we talking to him?

[01:43:49.900 --> 01:43:52.760]
Well, I'm not selling him for him, but you know, it's not that much.

[01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:52.960]
What?

[01:43:53.100 --> 01:43:55.300]
A couple hundred bucks for a real cheapy?

[01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:58.160]
I guess would be 150 for a real cheapo.

[01:43:58.280 --> 01:43:58.320]
Yeah.

[01:43:58.440 --> 01:43:59.940]
It's not worth it to put in my car.

[01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:01.280]
It isn't?

[01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:02.840]
My car is about to die.

[01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:04.440]
Oh, well then buy in that car.

[01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:05.060]
Well, wait a minute.

[01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:06.620]
Now let me ask you this question.

[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:09.820]
How about if she just had an AMFM-apportable radio in a car?

[01:44:09.940 --> 01:44:13.240]
I think F-A-M is very difficult, but I think FM will come in on that.

[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:15.600]
I'm not talking about a walkman because it's illegal to wear those,

[01:44:15.740 --> 01:44:17.000]
even though a lot of these morons do.

[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.320]
But I'm just talking about a radio who can sit on the seat.

[01:44:19.740 --> 01:44:20.860]
That we've got one.

[01:44:21.020 --> 01:44:22.140]
We have to get another one.

[01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:22.440]
Sure.

[01:44:22.780 --> 01:44:23.600]
There's no problem.

[01:44:23.620 --> 01:44:24.720]
FM will come in the car.

[01:44:24.780 --> 01:44:25.000]
Sure.

[01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:25.960]
And that's real.

[01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:27.200]
Because FM is line of sight.

[01:44:27.740 --> 01:44:27.860]
Yeah.

[01:44:28.100 --> 01:44:30.900]
I gotta tell you, I think I have one of your youngest fans.

[01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:33.780]
My five-year-old daughter loved listening to your show.

[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:34.240]
Great.

[01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:36.880]
When we're in the car, she loves that Joey song.

[01:44:37.180 --> 01:44:37.500]
Really?

[01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:39.960]
And she loved the Elle's song last night yesterday.

[01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:40.500]
Uh-huh.

[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:43.340]
And I just wanted to ask you one more thing.

[01:44:43.540 --> 01:44:46.220]
I want to know when they're going to put something decent on

[01:44:46.220 --> 01:44:48.060]
the AM drive time.

[01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:52.380]
Something to listen to in my car if I don't get an FM radio.

[01:44:52.900 --> 01:44:54.440]
Well, see, she misses all the FM radio.

[01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:54.940]
Oh, no, no.

[01:44:54.940 --> 01:44:57.040]
No, you've just got to get that FM radio.

[01:44:57.160 --> 01:44:57.600]
Trust me.

[01:44:58.000 --> 01:44:58.220]
Yeah.

[01:44:58.760 --> 01:44:59.460]
I mean, you don't have to.

[01:44:59.460 --> 01:45:00.320]
I mean, it's 1987.

[01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:00.920]
Yeah.

[01:45:01.060 --> 01:45:01.920]
I mean, you've got to come in there.

[01:45:02.180 --> 01:45:05.700]
I need something, but don't think you could put something good on the AM drive time.

[01:45:05.820 --> 01:45:06.660]
What do you mean in the morning?

[01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:07.120]
Yeah.

[01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:08.000]
No.

[01:45:08.220 --> 01:45:10.180]
It's not, um, not what you want.

[01:45:10.380 --> 01:45:11.760]
Well, listen, if you want some laughs.

[01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:15.980]
Well, what about Putin's AMICALs aren't six to ten?

[01:45:15.980 --> 01:45:17.940]
Well, you'd have to discuss that with him.

[01:45:18.020 --> 01:45:21.080]
He'll be on Saturday morning, six to ten, and I'm sure he'll have to regret that.

[01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:21.460]
Yeah.

[01:45:21.580 --> 01:45:23.000]
I used to listen to him on BSS.

[01:45:23.380 --> 01:45:23.920]
Yeah, he's good.

[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:24.560]
Yeah.

[01:45:24.740 --> 01:45:25.520]
He's got a lot of BS.

[01:45:25.740 --> 01:45:30.880]
One more thing I got to go, but, um, I've been hearing a lot about this I-95 song,

[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:34.200]
and I've only been listening to you for about six weeks, so I never heard it.

[01:45:34.300 --> 01:45:36.340]
Well, you allowed to put that on anymore?

[01:45:36.460 --> 01:45:37.260]
No, no, no.

[01:45:37.260 --> 01:45:37.440]
Oh, no.

[01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:42.280]
They came down from Portland, Maine, and they specifically, they re-enacted out.

[01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:44.440]
They did a lobotomy on the building, and they anched it out.

[01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:45.960]
You don't have it.

[01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:46.720]
No.

[01:45:46.900 --> 01:45:48.920]
Is it Cleve? They took it out of your building, huh?

[01:45:48.940 --> 01:45:50.280]
Well, out of this room, anyway.

[01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:50.600]
Right.

[01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:51.900]
They have locked away in a vault.

[01:45:51.980 --> 01:45:52.420]
Thanks a lot.

[01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:53.920]
Congratulations on your move.

[01:45:54.060 --> 01:45:57.020]
I hope I get an FM radio soon, so I don't miss two months.

[01:45:57.260 --> 01:45:57.440]
Please.

[01:45:57.780 --> 01:45:58.440]
Love you, so.

[01:45:58.600 --> 01:45:59.020]
Thanks a lot.

[01:45:59.100 --> 01:45:59.220]
Bye.

[01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:01.840]
Two requests for that, this hour, that's what you're saying.

[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:01.920]

[01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:03.480]
The uh, the uh, uh, 9.95 song.

[01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:05.040]
That's the second request this hour.

[01:46:05.140 --> 01:46:07.840]
Well, I'll tell you what, if you're really desperate, there is one guy in town playing it.

[01:46:08.860 --> 01:46:10.400]
But, uh, we're not going to tell you who that is.

[01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:10.780]
That's not worth it.

[01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:12.980]
It's uh, you know, it's old material by now.

[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.180]
It's rehashed. We've played it about four million times out.

[01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:18.580]
And if you're really desperate to get it, I have a feeling it's on that cassette tape.

[01:46:18.580 --> 01:46:20.800]
It is on that tape tape tape tape.

[01:46:20.820 --> 01:46:20.820]

[01:46:20.820 --> 01:46:24.720]
If you want to have it, not just here at once, but have it for your own, just send the birdie.

[01:46:24.740 --> 01:46:26.320]
Oh, boy, did I walk into that one?

[01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:28.180]
Just send the birdie cassette and uh,

[01:46:28.180 --> 01:46:28.880]
I'll go to my house.

[01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:29.440]
Why not?

[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:31.760]
On there, with that record, you send it to uh, bird.

[01:46:32.180 --> 01:46:33.000]
I must be asleep.

[01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:36.280]
Or bird.

[01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:37.620]
W-Z-T-A.

[01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:38.700]
Miami.

[01:46:39.900 --> 01:46:41.700]
3-3-0-5-5.

[01:46:41.940 --> 01:46:43.780]
Damn, self-adressed envelope. There's no charge.

[01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:46.180]
And he'll be more than delighted to make you a dub.

[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:47.860]
And that records on there along with all these others.

[01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:49.420]
And speaking of the bird.

[01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:53.220]
Excuse me, is this a pet shop?

[01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:54.200]
What does this hide say?

[01:46:54.340 --> 01:46:54.660]
Pet shop.

[01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:55.700]
Then it must be a pet shop.

[01:46:55.820 --> 01:46:56.460]
How can I help you?

[01:46:56.460 --> 01:46:57.520]
I want to get a dog for my wife.

[01:46:57.600 --> 01:46:58.520]
Oh, sorry, no trades.

[01:46:58.720 --> 01:46:59.480]
Do you have any bloodhounds?

[01:46:59.540 --> 01:46:59.780]
Sure.

[01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:01.060]
Or a peed here is a bloodhounds.

[01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:02.000]
What's like a bloodhound?

[01:47:02.140 --> 01:47:03.100]
Bleed for the man, peed.

[01:47:03.180 --> 01:47:05.240]
I also heard something about a thing called pet care.

[01:47:05.340 --> 01:47:05.800]
Oh, it's great.

[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:08.100]
Pet care will take care of virtually all your animals,

[01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:09.040]
veterinary expenses,

[01:47:09.220 --> 01:47:10.220]
and replace them with one,

[01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:12.220]
surprising the affordable annual payment.

[01:47:12.300 --> 01:47:12.720]
Oh, yeah.

[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:13.120]
How much?

[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:14.220]
Just $139.

[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:15.940]
Eight minutes till 1 at W-Y-N-Z.

[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:16.920]
The last hour and eight minutes.

[01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:19.240]
The Nearodger show on Wednesdays,

[01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:22.580]
moving Montmongue to a morning on Zeta 4.94.

[01:47:23.540 --> 01:47:25.080]
On FM Monday through Friday,

[01:47:25.420 --> 01:47:26.480]
6-10 AM.

[01:47:27.420 --> 01:47:28.980]
Did I leave it to 10 AM?

[01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:29.400]
In the morning.

[01:47:29.780 --> 01:47:30.080]
On FM.

[01:47:30.780 --> 01:47:30.860]
Yeah.

[01:47:31.340 --> 01:47:32.440]
You got to be very clear.

[01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:33.480]
You should not have done that.

[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:35.240]
No, now it's all over right now.

[01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:36.120]
We've confused them.

[01:47:36.260 --> 01:47:37.000]
FM on AM?

[01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:40.360]
What we've been doing FM on AM for the last year.

[01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:40.620]
True.

[01:47:41.020 --> 01:47:41.700]
That's very true.

[01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:43.060]
Oh, look at this.

[01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:44.220]
Charlie Kindles on the phone.

[01:47:44.340 --> 01:47:44.760]
Hi, Charlie.

[01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:45.640]
Thank you.

[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:46.300]
How you doing?

[01:47:46.500 --> 01:47:46.960]
Good. How are you?

[01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:48.580]
Good. Oh, no, this is just from Kindle.

[01:47:48.580 --> 01:47:51.080]
Oh, my heart.

[01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:51.500]
Yeah.

[01:47:51.580 --> 01:47:52.760]
I know you've got very nervous.

[01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:53.320]
God.

[01:47:53.580 --> 01:47:53.880]
What's up?

[01:47:54.220 --> 01:47:55.800]
I've been listening to you for about 10 years.

[01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:57.560]
And this is the first time I've ever called you.

[01:47:57.820 --> 01:47:58.000]
Really?

[01:47:58.340 --> 01:47:59.200]
It's a good the last day.

[01:47:59.420 --> 01:47:59.980]
I got a call.

[01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:01.480]
So.

[01:48:02.020 --> 01:48:04.960]
I saw what's his name.

[01:48:05.500 --> 01:48:07.200]
Howard Stern last night in David Letterman.

[01:48:07.340 --> 01:48:07.500]
Yeah.

[01:48:07.980 --> 01:48:09.160]
And he wasn't too bad.

[01:48:09.460 --> 01:48:10.660]
I've never seen him before.

[01:48:11.340 --> 01:48:12.540]
But he was all right.

[01:48:12.740 --> 01:48:15.360]
He talked about when he got thrown off of the late show.

[01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:16.680]
On Fox, yeah.

[01:48:17.260 --> 01:48:21.080]
For inferring that they had something to do with Edgar Rosenberg's death.

[01:48:21.380 --> 01:48:21.540]
Yeah.

[01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:22.000]
So.

[01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:23.700]
Who weren't you happy with?

[01:48:24.820 --> 01:48:26.360]
He said something about it.

[01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:27.780]
Yeah, obviously.

[01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:29.020]
I mean, he said something.

[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:30.140]
He said that on Fox.

[01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:30.580]
Yeah.

[01:48:30.580 --> 01:48:33.100]
He said that Tacey was thinking about the Joan Rivers husband.

[01:48:33.260 --> 01:48:33.820]
Oh, my God.

[01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:36.840]
And they said that they needed him in the dressing room or something.

[01:48:36.980 --> 01:48:37.820]
And they never appeared again.

[01:48:37.900 --> 01:48:39.480]
They wished him away or some damn thing.

[01:48:39.700 --> 01:48:39.700]

[01:48:39.820 --> 01:48:40.720]
It physically removed.

[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:41.920]
Did they really arm camera?

[01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:43.080]
Well, that's no.

[01:48:43.300 --> 01:48:44.000]
That's what he said.

[01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:47.720]
I love it.

[01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:49.360]
I told you the world was not ready for Howard.

[01:48:49.540 --> 01:48:50.520]
Only in New York.

[01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:50.760]
Right.

[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:53.480]
New York is a different world altogether, but not here.

[01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:56.280]
They only bleep one thing he said.

[01:48:56.280 --> 01:48:58.000]
But I really don't know what he said.

[01:48:58.000 --> 01:48:59.660]
Yeah, I'd like to find out.

[01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:01.360]
I'm a good lip reader.

[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:02.380]
I guarantee you I know it.

[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:04.140]
Knowing his material, I will be able to, yeah.

[01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:08.720]
So I'm glad you're going on FM because we can't get AM where I work.

[01:49:08.900 --> 01:49:09.060]
Right.

[01:49:09.740 --> 01:49:11.680]
At the Southeast Financial Center.

[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:12.260]
Oh, no.

[01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:13.500]
Not a chance.

[01:49:13.700 --> 01:49:17.220]
Oh, unfortunately, the only one we get is IOD.

[01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:17.980]
Ah.

[01:49:18.980 --> 01:49:21.500]
Well, I guarantee you the FM will really penetrate.

[01:49:23.140 --> 01:49:25.760]
There's going to be some strong penetration in all of those buildings.

[01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:42.860]
It's a very strong penetration.

[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:45.240]
I'm going to be able to get a little bit of a chance.

[01:49:45.260 --> 01:49:45.260]

[01:49:45.260 --> 01:49:45.260]

[01:49:45.260 --> 01:49:45.260]

[01:49:45.260 --> 01:49:45.260]

[01:49:45.260 --> 01:49:45.260]

[01:49:45.260 --> 01:49:45.260]

[01:49:45.260 --> 01:49:45.740]
I'm going to be able to get a chance.

[01:49:45.740 --> 01:49:46.140]
I'm going to be able to get a chance.

[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:47.040]
I'm going to be able to get a chance.

[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:48.460]
I'm going to be able to get a chance.

[01:49:48.460 --> 01:49:49.160]
I'm going to be able to get a chance.

[01:49:49.180 --> 01:49:50.420]
I'm going to be able to get a chance.

[01:49:50.420 --> 01:49:52.360]
I'm going to be able to get a chance.

[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:54.240]
I'm going to be able to get a chance.

[01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:55.740]
I'm going to be able to get a chance.

[01:49:56.900 --> 01:49:58.420]
Are you in Davey?

[01:49:58.420 --> 01:49:59.580]
Yes, I'm in Davey.

[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:01.240]
Okay. Well, you probably take a little nap.

[01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:02.800]
They cheer up call.

[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:04.560]
Waiting for the cows to come home.

[01:50:04.780 --> 01:50:05.060]
Oh, yeah.

[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:06.880]
I've been listening to you.

[01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:08.040]
Is that for me?

[01:50:09.180 --> 01:50:09.760]
I'm sorry.

[01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:11.160]
I've been listening to you for good maybe.

[01:50:12.460 --> 01:50:15.740]
I'm a competing station and you had the dating program.

[01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:16.400]
Oh, yeah.

[01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:18.680]
So, the good show.

[01:50:18.900 --> 01:50:19.480]
You bet it was.

[01:50:19.620 --> 01:50:20.120]
We had a lot of fun.

[01:50:20.220 --> 01:50:21.380]
We married 38 couples.

[01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:22.240]
That's right.

[01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:25.720]
And then some very nasty rumors started flying around.

[01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:27.500]
The station couldn't handle the rumors.

[01:50:27.900 --> 01:50:30.500]
I don't mention what they are because I don't think it's my place.

[01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:32.420]
But you mentioned them yourself several times.

[01:50:33.380 --> 01:50:35.780]
And you left that station and came to this station.

[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:37.300]
And someone took over the dating program.

[01:50:37.420 --> 01:50:37.720]
Wait a minute.

[01:50:37.900 --> 01:50:40.640]
Could the rumors have had anything to do with a closet?

[01:50:41.260 --> 01:50:41.520]
Yes.

[01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:43.540]
Very much so.

[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:44.600]
Yeah.

[01:50:44.940 --> 01:50:48.960]
And I don't know how many lifters out there remember all of those things.

[01:50:49.460 --> 01:50:51.000]
I don't even know what you're talking about.

[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:51.300]
You don't?

[01:50:51.380 --> 01:50:51.540]
No.

[01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:54.520]
He said there were rumors started to fly around the station.

[01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:55.180]
Yeah.

[01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:58.580]
Something about you stepping out of some closet or something.

[01:50:58.580 --> 01:51:01.600]
There were these papers and the whole community was up in arms.

[01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:03.940]
I mean, these nasty things on this show.

[01:51:04.940 --> 01:51:06.840]
I don't know if Tom took it over.

[01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:09.320]
And there were no rumors about him.

[01:51:09.320 --> 01:51:13.640]
And of course, the show very quickly degenerated into a the Kiki hour.

[01:51:13.820 --> 01:51:14.240]
Oh, yeah.

[01:51:14.360 --> 01:51:15.300]
That was the stinky hour.

[01:51:15.380 --> 01:51:15.540]
Yeah.

[01:51:15.540 --> 01:51:16.140]
I remember that.

[01:51:16.260 --> 01:51:18.100]
And one day it just disappeared.

[01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:19.280]
Yeah.

[01:51:19.780 --> 01:51:22.100]
I like the dating show they did on Fridays for a while.

[01:51:23.360 --> 01:51:26.860]
And they would not even cut people that mentioned it.

[01:51:27.100 --> 01:51:27.540]
Yeah.

[01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:29.360]
It even came on.

[01:51:29.640 --> 01:51:30.780]
A question.

[01:51:30.980 --> 01:51:32.000]
Why don't you bring that back?

[01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:32.760]
What?

[01:51:32.940 --> 01:51:33.500]
The dating show?

[01:51:33.700 --> 01:51:34.500]
No way.

[01:51:34.860 --> 01:51:36.180]
Well, I don't want to say no way.

[01:51:36.260 --> 01:51:36.880]
We'll see what happens.

[01:51:36.940 --> 01:51:37.940]
That might be big on FM.

[01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:45.300]
In any case, the real thing I want to tell you besides to compliment you for your many years of service to the community.

[01:51:45.540 --> 01:51:47.420]
I wish there were more closet people like you around.

[01:51:48.940 --> 01:51:52.080]
In any case, I want you to know that you have a lot of things to do with the community.

[01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:53.080]
In credible.

[01:51:54.660 --> 01:51:55.980]
I'm a cult greeting.

[01:51:56.260 --> 01:51:57.980]
I've been a cult greeting over the years.

[01:51:58.140 --> 01:52:02.060]
You know, the handshake, the grab thumbs, handshake.

[01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:02.460]
Oh, yeah.

[01:52:02.540 --> 01:52:03.460]
The drug brothers grip.

[01:52:03.700 --> 01:52:03.860]
Yeah.

[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.960]
And the response to in credible.

[01:52:07.340 --> 01:52:07.580]
Yeah.

[01:52:07.780 --> 01:52:10.340]
Of course, un-yellow ball.

[01:52:10.540 --> 01:52:12.100]
Hey, I got news for intermit making this up.

[01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:15.740]
We're going to have a whole bunch of buttons made up for Zeta 4.

[01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:20.480]
They're black buttons with yellow lettering and says unbelievable Zeta 4.

[01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:26.060]
Yeah, but the, but the, you know, the thing is that that, that, that, that, you know, people do not reply right.

[01:52:26.200 --> 01:52:26.920]
I mean, they're out.

[01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:29.360]
There's not, there's not in with it anymore.

[01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:31.180]
I experienced that many the other day.

[01:52:31.260 --> 01:52:32.080]
I found this girl.

[01:52:32.140 --> 01:52:34.080]
She was in credible.

[01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:34.480]
Yeah.

[01:52:34.780 --> 01:52:36.480]
36, 24, 38.

[01:52:37.320 --> 01:52:39.120]
Gorgeous, blonde, her blue eyes.

[01:52:39.160 --> 01:52:40.400]
We had this great time.

[01:52:40.500 --> 01:52:41.720]
We come back to my apartment.

[01:52:42.100 --> 01:52:43.340]
Turn the lights down low.

[01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:44.560]
Put on the soft music.

[01:52:44.760 --> 01:52:45.520]
Get her on the couch.

[01:52:46.220 --> 01:52:47.000]
Get her blouse off.

[01:52:47.100 --> 01:52:48.120]
I get her bra off.

[01:52:48.120 --> 01:52:51.100]
I mean, there's these two perfect breastening that I look at.

[01:52:51.160 --> 01:52:52.280]
I like this.

[01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:54.160]
It's incredible.

[01:52:54.620 --> 01:52:55.200]
And she looks at me.

[01:52:55.260 --> 01:52:55.820]
She's alive.

[01:52:56.760 --> 01:52:57.860]
And that was the end of that.

[01:52:58.080 --> 01:53:00.080]
I'm just thinking, feeling the mic stomach, I look at her.

[01:53:02.100 --> 01:53:02.740]
It's incredible.

[01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:03.600]
Yeah.

[01:53:03.980 --> 01:53:04.620]
It looks at me.

[01:53:04.720 --> 01:53:05.580]
There's black expression.

[01:53:05.660 --> 01:53:07.920]
I think there's a blood, more trans.

[01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:08.680]
So look at her.

[01:53:08.740 --> 01:53:11.260]
I said, unbelievable.

[01:53:12.140 --> 01:53:13.780]
And she says, why thank you.

[01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:15.820]
But the only thing I had in the back of the bra,

[01:53:15.820 --> 01:53:16.260]
right?

[01:53:16.260 --> 01:53:16.260]

[01:53:16.580 --> 01:53:17.340]
Right in the upper brow.

[01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:18.960]
And just like that, I mean, I look like one of these.

[01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:19.720]
Excellent.

[01:53:20.580 --> 01:53:21.840]
Good choice, my friend.

[01:53:22.680 --> 01:53:24.440]
But please, keep up the good work.

[01:53:24.700 --> 01:53:26.240]
See if you can bring back the dating show.

[01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:29.080]
Yeah, I mean, just because one guy ruined it doesn't have to disappear.

[01:53:29.300 --> 01:53:29.580]
Okay.

[01:53:29.860 --> 01:53:34.480]
There's a lot of people out there that still remember that and what the job you were doing.

[01:53:34.540 --> 01:53:35.800]
Okay, we'll give it some heavy thought.

[01:53:36.640 --> 01:53:37.540]
I'll read the durch.

[01:53:37.740 --> 01:53:38.080]
Thank you.

[01:53:38.300 --> 01:53:38.540]
Okay.

[01:53:39.080 --> 01:53:39.880]
Well, look at that.

[01:53:40.100 --> 01:53:41.860]
What a great piece of timing that was.

[01:53:41.980 --> 01:53:44.920]
John Freeman's standing by with some more of those miraculous headlines

[01:53:44.920 --> 01:53:49.000]

[01:53:49.820 --> 01:53:52.920]

Roger Show on W.I.N.Z. AM.

[01:54:00.460 --> 01:54:04.720]
We'd like to ask everyone to stop putting an S on the end of Stan Major's name.

[01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:06.860]
One Stan Major is all we can handle.

Did he go!

[01:57:08.060 --> 01:57:11.080]

[01:57:11.080 --> 01:57:16.640]
lives. I need to do any question about that. And of course some of us will be at the melting pot

[01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:20.560]
sometime this weekend and oh we've had a lot of great comments about that too and I'm

[01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:23.600]
salivating. I'm really getting ready. Are you going to be there with Sharon today?

[01:57:24.340 --> 01:57:31.440]
Be having dinner with Sharon. You know it's still not too late by the way to work you out of that show

[01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:37.160]
and do understand that. Max is arranging all the mics and all the furniture in there so

[01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:42.120]
so. Okay let's take some calls here. You're part of history being made now ladies and gentlemen.

[01:57:42.740 --> 01:57:50.480]
50 minutes and counting. Mm-hmm boy. Thank God. Miami. Hello. Hello.

[01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:56.600]
Oh, no. I think here he is. First time call up. Long time listen.

[01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:08.060]
I haven't called you in about a year. Yeah. Thank God. Probably probably accounts for our success.

[01:58:09.160 --> 01:58:14.740]
You're not saying I was a chronic regular. No, I think chronic irregular would be a better

[01:58:16.820 --> 01:58:21.320]
one. Now I haven't called you since you've gone on days. How come? Why? Well you know it's

[01:58:21.320 --> 01:58:27.060]
during the day. Yeah okay. Yeah. You know some of us have to work. Oh no. In other words he's

[01:58:27.060 --> 01:58:31.440]
warning us that now that we're going to be on in the morning. Look out. I'm going to call you

[01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:38.060]
every day twice a day. No. Are you the guy who called God and you're one to be put on hold today?

[01:58:38.180 --> 01:58:43.920]
Oh no but I must admit that was a pretty good idea. Yeah. I want to tell you the truth. You've

[01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:50.440]
been doing an absolutely super job. Both of you. Yeah we believe it. Yeah. Let's see. Let's see. I

[01:58:50.440 --> 01:58:55.840]
wasn't I wasn't one of these shall we say Neil Rogers virgins you know they just discovered

[01:58:55.840 --> 01:58:59.540]
you during the day. Yeah well there are a lot of people who think that I just you know just

[01:59:00.300 --> 01:59:04.680]
hatched out of an egg or something here and don't realize I've been you know putting up with

[01:59:04.680 --> 01:59:10.140]
crap in this market for years for 12 years. I started to listen to you in 1979 so it's like

[01:59:10.140 --> 01:59:17.920]
eight years. Yeah too long. Let me ask you a question. Ask me anything. All right. Where do you get

[01:59:17.920 --> 01:59:24.360]
like that that that Dr. Irving paycheck thing? Is that done for you or is that part of an album there?

[01:59:24.360 --> 01:59:29.820]
That that particular one came out of New York from the American comedy network. But we have stuff

[01:59:29.820 --> 01:59:33.560]
that comes from everywhere. I mean we got a lot of very creative listeners and we have other

[01:59:34.120 --> 01:59:38.220]
talent in the market that did some of this stuff. It's from everywhere. So like it comes out of the

[01:59:38.220 --> 01:59:44.720]
sky. Bloods in. Yeah. Did you see you were on the news last night? Yes we did. And I never

[01:59:44.720 --> 01:59:50.680]
looked but you're always great. She's a good looking handsome I would say. She's a very handsome guy.

[01:59:55.440 --> 01:59:59.780]
Now I just I just wanted to call you you know because I hadn't I hadn't called you since you were on

Well thank you very much. Okay talk to you next year. Okay bye bye. It was interesting to see

[02:00:26.460 --> 02:00:30.380]
Anne talking about you last night wasn't it? Did you enjoy it? I didn't see the 11 o'clock. I saw

[02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:46.300]
And everyone's been tinkling on you today. I want to address the bird. Okay take a

[02:00:46.480 --> 02:00:53.140]
look at the bird. At first you know like many I found you to be a bit of an irritant to say the least.

[02:00:53.300 --> 02:00:57.360]
But every so slowly you can't go if you're way into our hearts.

[02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:08.280]
Funny. Yeah. It sort of puts you over the top. Great. So to speak. It was so badly for you when

[02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:14.140]
a short while back you seem to be on Neil's S list. I did. A couple of days there yeah you were just

[02:01:14.140 --> 02:01:18.680]
a bad habit of opening up his mail. You were losing well he was not only opening up the mail here but

[02:01:18.680 --> 02:01:23.300]
he was becoming obsessed with it. Anyway the tinkering with it and shuffling it around and just

[02:01:24.120 --> 02:01:30.340]
making a mess. Now I'm glad you're coming Mr. Vial to FM. Thank you. I am too. Yeah I went to the hitchhike

[02:01:30.340 --> 02:01:33.880]
or the hitchhru the other night. Well wait a minute before you go into that there is I'm not sure

[02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:38.800]
which restaurant it is but in honor of our new morning show they're one of the fine gourmet

[02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:42.060]
restaurants in town is added a new item on the menu it's called Vial and the Bird.

[02:01:43.540 --> 02:01:49.140]
Sounds tasty. Okay so you saw the hitchhru? Yeah I'm the keychain guy by the way.

[02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:58.280]
Oh. Anyway I saw the hitchhru and I left. Blast from the past. What? What the refresh our memory

[02:01:58.280 --> 02:02:06.500]
you've changed about the keychain. What did you do? Is it the gold keychain? Oh yeah okay now I

[02:02:06.500 --> 02:02:12.840]

[02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:20.340]
the Pita Moussalle. Go ahead. I sent for the bird. Yes yes sir. You saw the hitchhru? Yes

[02:02:20.340 --> 02:02:24.660]

[02:02:24.660 --> 02:02:29.840]
like? I don't know very briefly but Rutger was in custody on the police bus. Yes.

[02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:39.700]
Aim that tune. Okay what's the question sir? I can't remember the music that was played in that scene.

[02:02:40.180 --> 02:02:45.440]
Oh you was humming a tune. You was humming to himself as he was planning his escape. Oh I can't

[02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:51.440]
remember. Oh boo. So you could have gotten a keychain if you got that one. What was it? What was the

[02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:58.920]
answer? I know what it was. My money is the homotones for the kids. What is it? I'm half crazy

[02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:12.620]
all for the love of you. Oh yeah. Yeah half crazy. Well whatever comes before that is the name

[02:03:12.620 --> 02:03:16.800]
of the song. Yeah right exactly. Old Daisy something about Daisy.

[02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:17.620]
Mm hmm.

[02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:24.360]
A pop pop pop. A bicycle built for the I sickle. No that's not it. See you want to say anything you

[02:03:24.360 --> 02:03:30.440]
go along with it. No that's not it. A bicycle built for you. I'm half crazy. I think so. Yeah but not

[02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:36.100]
bicycle built for two. It's a similar tune. I think there's a bird in there. Similar tune.

[02:03:37.240 --> 02:03:43.820]
Yes sir. Yes. All right when you meet a lady and she's got a moral interface and as you get

[02:03:43.820 --> 02:03:48.780]
to know her she comes more and more attractive as you get to know her and like her and then that moral

[02:03:48.780 --> 02:03:53.680]
sort of becomes a beauty mark. That's kind of how you are. Oh I see. Well you'll be interested to know

[02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:59.760]
sir that it was one year ago that they fired me at my previous radio. I thought that was yesterday.

[02:04:00.100 --> 02:04:06.160]
Well yesterday was the day. Today is the date. October 10th. It was last October 10th that they fired

[02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:10.360]
me. That was the best thing that ever happened. Absolutely. They couldn't deal with me over there.

[02:04:10.360 --> 02:04:16.220]
They just couldn't take it. We've learned to see very nice addition. Yes thank you very much.

[02:04:16.340 --> 02:04:23.280]
I feel great. Have a wonderful life. Okay. It's a good time. We have great taste. Yeah. Neil

Yeah that is not the song that he hums during that scene. You know we're just looking up at the

[02:04:37.620 --> 02:04:50.820]
crazy. Now we're beginning to sound like those guys on it. Just we heard moments ago. They sing

[02:04:50.820 --> 02:04:55.280]
duets. You know like in the shower they sing together those two. That's what I heard. Look out

[02:04:55.940 --> 02:05:01.920]
they go on that cruise and you know all the strain about the studio. Everywhere together.

[02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:08.280]

Good. How you doing? Fine. Alright I'm a first time car Neil.

[02:05:15.060 --> 02:05:19.620]
Does that bug you? You know when like somebody you try to remember something and somebody plants

[02:05:19.620 --> 02:05:24.780]
the seed and you just can't remember it. Yeah. And it drives you nuts. Absolutely. I wanted to be in

[02:05:24.780 --> 02:05:31.440]

[02:05:49.820 --> 02:05:54.720]
put happen. Well I do know that he bought a house but the rumor is he has he hasn't unpacked okay.

[02:05:55.140 --> 02:05:59.340]
And the next thing I don't know if you can remember back a ways but the guy that's the

[02:05:59.340 --> 02:06:04.380]
he can replace the IOD and he even doing better than that guy. Mike Miller well he's in West Palm Beach.

[02:06:04.540 --> 02:06:08.440]
Like Miller is? Yeah. Yeah. He's can't get better ratings with him because it was. No he doesn't.

[02:06:08.600 --> 02:06:12.680]
Steve went down as a matter of fact it's interesting you should ask that because among all the other

[02:06:12.680 --> 02:06:18.140]
crap that Mark left me here are the numbers going back all year as a matter of four for all the

[02:06:18.140 --> 02:06:23.360]
day parts and I mean he left me everything you know I like to see that and let's see three to

[02:06:23.360 --> 02:06:32.720]
seven p.m. Here it is W.I.O. Dean I like like in the afternoon yeah okay like April May and June

[02:06:32.720 --> 02:06:39.240]
that's it they had a 3.1 okay Mike Miller okay most of that is Mike Miller Steve came on a year like

[02:06:39.240 --> 02:06:44.540]
what June 8th June I think June 8th so most of that is Mike though then they went down to a two

[02:06:45.260 --> 02:06:50.540]
two nine and now the full book of two six so he's gone down a half a point in just like three

[02:06:50.540 --> 02:06:56.040]
months it's great I hate the guy yeah he's a real pompous ass no talent goofball who's just filled

[02:06:56.040 --> 02:07:00.860]
with himself an ego that's bigger than the whole community that's true you know he's in he's never

[02:07:00.860 --> 02:07:05.240]
had a number he's never had a giant audience he's never had a big following and he's just a great

[02:07:05.240 --> 02:07:09.200]
BS artist you know he's done this great con job and more power to him if they're dumb enough to

[02:07:09.200 --> 02:07:13.060]
bang that kind of money and to think that he's gonna really build them an audience you know it's

[02:07:13.060 --> 02:07:16.860]
it's typical they're just a bunch of moron he said the other day what he made I don't listen to

[02:07:16.860 --> 02:07:22.120]
him much because I don't like him but he said he makes 600 grand well that's yeah for three years

[02:07:22.120 --> 02:07:27.480]
oh now he's got these combined in great here yeah yeah I was amazed I like the guy Mike Miller

[02:07:27.480 --> 02:07:31.300]
he's the first well let me just say this to you the audience is not interested in how much the

[02:07:31.300 --> 02:07:36.620]
talent is making they're interested in whether the show is good and the show does to the excellent

[02:07:36.620 --> 02:07:41.420]
word stink is exactly what I was thinking of you know I listen to Mike Miller he was the first

[02:07:41.860 --> 02:07:47.500]
AM guy I listen to and they'd yank him off yeah and I work when you have your show but during my

four one in the afternoon drive in this market is a gigantic number high as a long day in addition

[02:20:05.440 --> 02:20:10.020]
to which if you take out the six o'clock hour in the two they probably have about a four eight

[02:20:10.020 --> 02:20:14.520]
that's right so uh that's the highest number I think at afternoon drive since Jerry Williams left

[02:20:14.980 --> 02:20:19.280]
well that's right the rating seriously and that's uh seven years ago three to seven so two there

[02:20:19.280 --> 02:20:22.740]

[02:22:05.020 --> 02:22:10.140]
the other way. Are you going to bid a do to the Bahamas? No, actually, we had a caller

[02:22:10.140 --> 02:22:13.740]
earlier and he said that he can hear the FM in the Bahamas. Really? So I guess depending

[02:22:13.740 --> 02:22:17.280]
on which part they live in, some of them can hear it. Well, somebody could pick it up

[02:22:17.280 --> 02:22:22.880]
on their satellite. Sure. We listen, we don't want the Bahamas. Okay, you can have them.

[02:22:22.880 --> 02:22:26.600]
You have a lot of fans. Yeah. Good. Good luck to them. You know, you have the Bahamas

[02:22:26.600 --> 02:22:31.040]
and you're very big done there. They've been having a run. I've just made your Voodoo

[02:22:31.040 --> 02:22:37.220]
dolls just like to eat and you're very important to them done there. Miami, hello. Hello. Yes,

[02:22:37.320 --> 02:22:44.860]
sir. I'd like to make a few pottery machinille. Okay. Okay. The owners and our management of

[02:22:44.860 --> 02:22:50.880]
WID were absent when they passed our brain matter. Excellent comments. The next I'd like to

[02:22:50.880 --> 02:22:55.940]
say that I also offer my sympathy to you as you will be on the weakest power transmitting

[02:22:55.940 --> 02:23:06.640]
stations. I left them frequency stations in this area. Go ahead, sir. I have tried it

[02:23:06.640 --> 02:23:11.600]
out on three different radios, the GE, a magnet box and an Emerson and I'm very sorry.

[02:23:11.840 --> 02:23:16.680]
Well, why don't you put some batteries in them? I've got to buy a new radio till I really

[02:23:16.680 --> 02:23:21.880]
get you in strong. Do you want to say that I hope that when you bring Zeta up from the

[02:23:21.880 --> 02:23:28.700]
doldrums of their 1.2 and 1.4 ratings, yes, that they will increase their transmitting power.

[02:23:28.840 --> 02:23:32.860]
What are you talking about? They're 100,000 watts. They're having a run the cricket

[02:23:32.860 --> 02:23:36.980]
crop. Wait, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Let me just say this to you that there was a problem

[02:23:36.980 --> 02:23:43.360]
on the FM tower and all the FM's are down. They're operating 20% power right now, but tonight

[02:23:43.360 --> 02:23:47.500]
they're going to go out and fix that. So if you've done that anytime very recently. Yeah,

[02:23:47.500 --> 02:23:51.600]
like today, that's why I see. Well, I'm in the area. I guess you're familiar with, you

[02:23:51.600 --> 02:23:56.860]
know, the jockey club cricket club, quesad, 114, this team, Boulevard. All right. Now,

[02:23:56.880 --> 02:23:59.200]
we have an event. I hope you're different. What? What does that mean? In other words,

[02:23:59.200 --> 02:24:05.020]
we're not 100,000 watts. What we are. We're like 2 billion watts. No, they tell me that

[02:24:05.020 --> 02:24:11.980]
the signal is just gangbusters. Well, Sally is back. Everybody who comes in become

[02:24:11.980 --> 02:24:16.860]
Sally. You know, I'm like, this is right. Okay. I wish you the like it. Thank you. And

[02:24:16.860 --> 02:24:25.120]
also a fast future change to a more productive salary and a powerful radio station. Excellent.

[02:24:25.240 --> 02:24:29.660]
But we can listen to you in the afternoon or an evening hours. Thank you. They don't listen

[02:24:29.660 --> 02:24:34.320]
to that. Yeah. The guy on his intentions were good. He, you know, wishes us the best.

[02:24:34.320 --> 02:24:38.500]
Like the lady who wants me to go on at nine because it's your schedule. The weather

[02:24:38.500 --> 02:24:42.980]
is not going to do everybody. We've got to accommodate everybody. Sure. Okay. Well, we're

[02:24:42.980 --> 02:24:47.180]
getting really right out of the nitty gritty. Now, aren't we 18 till getting nervous, getting

[02:24:47.180 --> 02:24:52.540]
very nervous. The tension is building a wait till Monday morning. What's that? Well, I

[02:24:52.540 --> 02:24:56.200]
have a few. I have a few things I want to discuss with you about my mind. Oh, by the way,

[02:24:56.260 --> 02:24:59.520]
that crap about the phones that I heard is so ridiculous. I've dialed it up to have

[02:24:59.520 --> 02:25:03.360]
no problem. There are no fast disease. They've, they've, it's a lot better than it used

[02:25:03.360 --> 02:25:07.100]
to be. You know, and as we've said before, you can only talk to one person at a time,

[02:25:07.100 --> 02:25:11.220]
right? Don't, don't flake out now because you've got this. Here we go. On the day

[02:25:11.220 --> 02:25:15.120]
the numbers come out. We're all in the state of euphoria. And I hear yesterday, I leave

[02:25:15.120 --> 02:25:19.100]
here and he's agreeing with all these. Well, there is doom. Doom. There's one thing

[02:25:19.100 --> 02:25:24.020]
that you do have to remember doing morning drive. And what might that be? And I've

[02:25:24.020 --> 02:25:31.360]
done it on a talk. Yes. That your length of holding on is much, much less. Why we've

[02:25:31.360 --> 02:25:35.580]
only got five lines. We don't need eight million lines over there. And we're not going

[02:25:35.580 --> 02:25:39.200]
to put them on hold. Of course. Punch them up. We'll punch them up when we feel like

[02:25:39.200 --> 02:25:43.860]
it. No, we are going to put them on hold. Really? That changed. Yeah. We're okay. I

[02:25:43.860 --> 02:25:50.760]
didn't get the word. By the way, well, I'll tell you after you. You're in the

[02:25:50.760 --> 02:25:55.640]
wild. Fly by the studio of pants radio. Monday morning. That's the way we like it. That's

[02:25:55.640 --> 02:25:59.100]
why this show is fun. We don't sit down and prepare a thing. We had a time. No prep.

[02:25:59.400 --> 02:26:02.520]
And do all the stupid things. You know, and lay it all out. We didn't do that. So

[02:26:02.520 --> 02:26:09.620]
whatever happened in the goof off. How can I grow? Hello? I but say, bud. Listen, I haven't

[02:26:09.620 --> 02:26:16.120]
heard of you guys since I went to Holland in April. I was going to call you a collect

[02:26:16.120 --> 02:26:21.520]
from over there. But I figured you guys wouldn't take it. No chance. Well, I've grown

[02:26:21.520 --> 02:26:27.720]
accustomed to your face to Glenn. I couldn't stand them in the beginning. But he's okay.

[02:26:27.720 --> 02:26:36.220]
He grows on you. Like an enormous tumor. Have you to say what your first song is going

[02:26:36.220 --> 02:26:41.140]
to be? Well, we'll have to mull that over this afternoon. We don't want to tip our hat.

[02:26:41.280 --> 02:26:45.420]
You don't give the competition any probably something by Don Johnson. Yeah, I would think so.

[02:26:45.500 --> 02:26:51.880]
I like Don. He hates the hero. He said no to well, Harold, sir. And I like Don. He was

[02:26:51.880 --> 02:26:57.480]
on brick well. I mean, you filming last night. Yeah. Again. Yeah. Did you get a

[02:26:57.480 --> 02:27:07.320]
haircut? No, no. Same thing. No, no, no, no. Oh, my God. Look at who's upstairs. Like

[02:27:07.320 --> 02:27:13.300]
a vulture just hovering waiting to extricate us from this awful plot. New boss. Our new

[02:27:13.300 --> 02:27:18.700]
boss. Well, he's in for a big surprise. He hasn't heard either. He's going to be doing

[02:27:18.700 --> 02:27:22.680]
Saturday, two to six over. That's correct. And Saturday morning on the end. I don't

[02:27:22.680 --> 02:27:26.260]
know. I would listen to that. He's going to do the beetle thing on the FF. Yeah. He's going

[02:27:26.260 --> 02:27:29.640]
to come over here and breakfast with the beetles. Yeah. Did you hear that call from Rick

[02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:33.800]
of Rick and Spuds? Yeah. Excellent. Yeah. Excellent. Another pretty good guy. So just

[02:27:33.800 --> 02:27:38.160]
they work for that douchebag, you know. Oh, he's not an otzi. Genius. He's not an

[02:27:38.160 --> 02:27:43.840]
otzi. And we certainly acknowledge that. Skeacher a little bit to the right little dictatorial

[02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:48.260]
for him, but definitely not an otzi. No question about make no mistake. Not even with

[02:27:48.260 --> 02:27:54.400]
a small in. We have never seen. Well, okay. So what were you saying? Boy, I lost it now.

[02:27:54.580 --> 02:27:58.980]
I'm sorry. Well, we're getting so emotional now toward the end. You know, it's gitty.

[02:27:59.440 --> 02:28:04.680]
Yeah. Santa, I remember listening back around January and you and you had these all over

[02:28:04.680 --> 02:28:08.500]
80 callers. Yeah. Isn't it amazing how and one well, really, in less than a year,

[02:28:08.540 --> 02:28:12.180]
have totally turned to demographic of the station around. That's complete. Got these living

[02:28:12.180 --> 02:28:16.580]
and breet well. I won't say living and breathing, but young pinheads, just the jimmies of

[02:28:16.580 --> 02:28:21.680]
them. People that advertising agencies swoon over. Yes. Well, I can't listen to you as often

[02:28:21.680 --> 02:28:25.580]
now in the morning. I only go to school two days a week. So it's the only time I have

[02:28:25.580 --> 02:28:28.960]
to get up early enough to listen to you. Oh, no. You know, they say that in the beginning,

[02:28:28.960 --> 02:28:32.820]
but you'll discover just like the bird, it's contagious and it starts growing on you

[02:28:32.820 --> 02:28:36.460]
and you'll be a rolling, you know, just roll over in the sack, reach over, turn on the

[02:28:36.460 --> 02:28:40.260]
radio and you know, all right. Well, reach over your boyfriend's head and turn on the

[02:28:40.260 --> 02:28:44.920]
radio. Oh, Glenn, you gotta come down to Haiti sometime. Haiti. Oh, you'd be big

[02:28:44.920 --> 02:28:51.440]
down there. Hades, Hades, cooking, growth. Oh, Kades. Oh, Hades, Hades in the

[02:28:51.440 --> 02:28:55.980]
growl. You'll be a Hadeser and do time. Trust me. What is that? Some of us say Hades.

[02:28:56.340 --> 02:29:02.040]
What is it? Sabar. Oh, oh boy. I don't cut up your rally. I don't go to buy. You might

[02:29:02.040 --> 02:29:07.700]
like this one. Oh, I'm sure you will. Yeah. What would be the salient feature of this

[02:29:07.700 --> 02:29:11.800]
bar? Okay, let me get my little hand. Jeff Striker is dressing up as Phoebe Cates this

[02:29:11.800 --> 02:29:15.800]
month. Okay. That's it. That's more or less. That's the kind of bar it is. So you probably

[02:29:15.800 --> 02:29:20.040]
get into it. Okay, listen, have a wonderful life. Regulations and I hope you'll see you

[02:29:20.040 --> 02:29:23.920]
often. Thanks a lot. Okay, now this next one is supposed to be great. You're giving it

[02:29:23.920 --> 02:29:28.620]
a big build up. Okay, better be. Hello. Big build up. Yes, you got a gigantic build up,

[02:29:28.620 --> 02:29:31.500]
sir. Is this a good call? Yeah, it is going to be a good call. Okay, we're waiting.

[02:29:31.760 --> 02:29:36.540]
Okay, you remember, well, you ever watch Channel 10 and you see the rally? Flashback. Yeah.

[02:29:36.940 --> 02:29:41.400]
Okay, well, I'm a Neil Rogers flashback. Good. Okay, now you got it there with me a second

[02:29:41.400 --> 02:29:46.080]
because I got to cue this up here and you know, I'm working with a short phone cord here.

[02:29:46.400 --> 02:29:51.800]
So, well, we know, we know that most of our crowd has a short cord. Really notice that,

[02:29:51.900 --> 02:29:57.060]
right off. I like to track. Two seconds. I'm going to hit it and we'll see what happens.

[02:29:57.320 --> 02:30:04.680]
Okay. Hang on one second. What's burning in here, by the way? A cigarette. Oh, boy,

[02:30:04.680 --> 02:30:10.620]
it smells like you've got a forest fire. Well, that's great. Excellent. Yeah. What is that? Oh,

[02:30:10.800 --> 02:30:16.920]
boy. Sure, appreciate that. Yeah. At the Jewish FM, so, you turned down the job from where you got

[02:30:16.920 --> 02:30:22.200]
on that station. Let me tell you something, sir. If I walk up the engine, they do a lot of lines

[02:30:22.200 --> 02:30:28.500]
on the company up there all the way across the place, across the line. That's it. Yeah,

[02:30:28.800 --> 02:30:33.080]
well, I'll see you both here. We'll spend with you with his suspenders. That's a good,

[02:30:33.080 --> 02:30:35.800]
scary life. There's a lot kind of stuff. There'll be none at all.

[02:30:39.380 --> 02:30:43.360]
Did it work the way? Excellent. Sensational. You were right. A classic.

[02:30:44.660 --> 02:30:47.380]
Thank you. And it's up. Don't hang up on it. Okay.

[02:30:52.760 --> 02:30:57.000]
Come back. Okay. That was a classic flashback. Yeah, that was a good one.

[02:30:57.640 --> 02:31:02.880]
At what? April, maybe they're eating a lot of crow up there now. In fact, the bird better watch

[02:31:02.880 --> 02:31:07.360]
it. They're developing an appetite. It will fess it under glass. Let me tell you my prediction here.

[02:31:07.460 --> 02:31:15.740]
A little vulture parmesan. Go ahead, sir. I think within six months. Yes.

[02:31:16.380 --> 02:31:22.400]
And it'd be all tough. FM. There's denying it. Yeah. You know what that means. But we keep hearing that.

[02:31:22.400 --> 02:31:27.060]
Never know. Over and over. They're usually about six months behind anything that makes sense. So,

[02:31:27.200 --> 02:31:31.900]
look out. We don't want to get our people nervous up there. Okay. They're nervous enough.

[02:31:32.280 --> 02:31:37.460]
We don't want them to be insecure and friendly. Okay. Who is that phone on the floor back there?

[02:31:37.560 --> 02:31:42.880]
Stracking up. What? Who is that cracking up back there? Rick and Spuds.

[02:31:45.100 --> 02:31:48.100]
They came in this morning to wish us good luck. Well, listen, I have a wonderful life and

[02:31:48.100 --> 02:31:50.980]
thanks for their memories. Yeah, I have a wonderful life. Okay.

[02:32:02.860 --> 02:32:05.940]
Right now the president director is having a harem.

[02:32:07.360 --> 02:32:10.900]
We'll preview again of Westcom Monday morning on WINZ.

[02:32:10.900 --> 02:32:10.960]
Yeah.

[02:32:14.380 --> 02:32:20.300]
Called news and illusion. Okay. Now here comes that exciting moment that we've all been waiting for.

[02:32:20.480 --> 02:32:24.580]
Ladies and gentlemen, those of you with your gold embossed score cards,

[02:32:24.580 --> 02:32:30.980]
who are going to be having to get up earlier now. Our last break on WINZ. This is a monumental moment.

[02:32:31.080 --> 02:32:36.340]
We want you to get out your red pens, mark off the last spots and hold your breath.

[02:32:36.340 --> 02:32:41.800]
The other participation may affect you. What do you mean that's what you've been reading all morning?

[02:32:43.660 --> 02:32:50.020]
Your mic's not on. That's okay. It's still not on. One, two, there you go. Notice the headline.

[02:32:50.500 --> 02:32:54.340]
Oh, Linda. Cut. Now, poor Linda. I know. She has to write those.

[02:32:54.640 --> 02:33:00.080]
W-L-Y-F still tops Spanish talk rises. Now you've been reading this all morning and I didn't even

[02:33:00.080 --> 02:33:03.980]
know it was in the hero because I don't get it. I assumed you did. Did you see that one?

[02:33:03.980 --> 02:33:06.360]
It's easy. Is there something in there? Depressed.

[02:33:06.840 --> 02:33:13.860]
Wheel Rogers. Fails. Yeah. I'm not kidding. You want to see it? Fails. Well, almost.

[02:33:14.160 --> 02:33:18.120]
That's what it said. Yeah. All right. Loses. Loses. Yeah. What are you talking about?

[02:33:19.900 --> 02:33:24.960]
The fickle eye on radio listing cast its sites in slightly different directions this summer.

[02:33:25.160 --> 02:33:31.420]
Says Linda. Easy listing life kept its number one. While in the spring English language,

[02:33:31.420 --> 02:33:36.000]
news talk stations were up over all Spanish language news talk down that trend was reversed in

[02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:40.980]
the summer. WQBA landed in second place with a six five W Y and Z dropped a third place with a

[02:33:40.980 --> 02:33:48.280]
five oh all three CHR stations were down a little bit. Three AOR stations gained audience.

[02:33:49.040 --> 02:33:54.680]
Most adult contemporary stations rose. Most. I guess you left left 90. No, there it is. Obviously.

[02:33:54.680 --> 02:34:01.700]
Despite its average ratings loss W Y and Z ratings decline for W Y and Z Rogers. What kind

[02:34:01.700 --> 02:34:08.200]
of a headline is that? Hey, Tim, you're a. I'm a career on depressing note, but.

[02:34:08.780 --> 02:34:13.500]
Well, wait till you hear this by Bill Kelly. This indicates a leveling off in Rogers popularity.

[02:34:13.840 --> 02:34:18.280]
Following the controversy and predictable leap in ratings he received during the shock radio

[02:34:18.280 --> 02:34:22.780]
hey, day of early summer, yet even a seven point five rating is impressive for a cultural host in

[02:34:22.780 --> 02:34:26.680]
this market. I think what this guy knows about radio you can put on a thimble. I would try to

[02:34:26.680 --> 02:34:30.440]
head this early. I did on the whole show on this jackass. He didn't talk to anybody. You believe

[02:34:30.440 --> 02:34:36.180]
this? Not only didn't he talk to anybody? On listen to this Rogers moved to W Y and Z sister

[02:34:36.180 --> 02:34:42.300]
stations. Zeta four is regarded by the competition as a desperate move to boost data's flagging ratings

[02:34:42.300 --> 02:34:47.980]
at the expense of W Y and Z AM, which will surely suffer from Rogers absence. Oh, what a what an

[02:34:47.980 --> 02:34:55.400]
article this is. What an article. What a mong piece of crap. Couldn't even bother to call.

[02:34:55.660 --> 02:34:59.560]
Anyway, Bill Kelly. Yeah, what you know about it now we're sliding. You know, I wish

[02:34:59.560 --> 02:35:04.000]
wait till we get the breakdown in September. I figured out we had about an 11 share in September.

[02:35:04.120 --> 02:35:08.600]
The biggest month I've ever had in daytime. Maybe anybody's had in the modern history of this

[02:35:08.600 --> 02:35:13.340]
market in daytime. Yeah. And the reason that went down was seven five is because in June and July

[02:35:13.340 --> 02:35:18.600]
was on vacation for three weeks and Oli North took us into the toilet for the month in July, I guess

[02:35:18.600 --> 02:35:23.380]
it was unbelievable. What this man knows is nothing and he got him writing this column.

[02:35:23.680 --> 02:35:27.960]
The people of the Sun Sentinel. Like the other guy. What's his name? One Kate. No, no, no, no,

[02:35:28.140 --> 02:35:31.760]
the other idiot. The one that writes Buddy Nevin's who doesn't know where we are in the dial.

[02:35:31.800 --> 02:35:38.020]
Memory here putting seven ninety. Oh, the Sun Sentinel. I'm going to tell you. Just say no to

[02:35:38.020 --> 02:35:43.200]
the Sun Sentinel friends. We need the newspaper in this town, you know. Well, that's all I think.

[02:35:44.960 --> 02:35:49.800]
What is Linda Gunn here specific day part and hourly ratings could not be confirmed at

[02:35:49.800 --> 02:35:54.420]
press. Well, why didn't she call us yesterday? We would have given it to her all. In mid days,

[02:35:54.540 --> 02:35:59.680]
the top five were life Neil Rogers joy one oh seven QBA and Ellen Jaffey on Waxie.

[02:36:00.720 --> 02:36:10.140]
That a great book. Waxie did yeah. Lucky. No, no, no, no, I say lucky. Yeah, they were lucky.

[02:36:12.920 --> 02:36:18.400]
Kind of kidding. They had a what do they have a four five? Wow. Yeah, they were up a whole

[02:36:18.400 --> 02:36:22.840]
well. That's great. Of course, no forgetting in the summertime, the music music station.

[02:36:22.840 --> 02:36:29.000]
Most of them go up and the news talk go down. I know. Look at this. I'm telling you, I just I

[02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:33.960]
still can't believe this. I couldn't even get that point. You know what this is from the school

[02:36:33.960 --> 02:36:39.400]
of wishful thinking and we're all desperate. A desperate move to save Zeta and Rogers is desperate

[02:36:39.400 --> 02:36:44.680]
and on and on and on. It goes and where it stops. Nobody knows. Well, I tell you, the print media

[02:36:44.680 --> 02:36:48.740]
in this town so bushly, it's embarrassing. Now, you know why we thank goodness for Linda

[02:36:48.740 --> 02:36:53.420]
and for Tom Jicke for weren't for them. We'd really be in trouble. Miami Lakes could be our very last

[02:36:53.420 --> 02:36:59.900]
call on WYNZ. Hello. Hi, Neil. How does it feel to make history? Oh, I'm just thrilled to be your last

[02:36:59.900 --> 02:37:05.580]
call in my first call to you. Wow. Want to congratulate you on all your success. Thank you. And

[02:37:05.580 --> 02:37:10.240]
Zeta wanted to say is that it really takes a person to have a good self esteem to listen to you

[02:37:10.240 --> 02:37:18.400]
because if you have a good self esteem, you won't mind. So when taking a poke at every now and then.

[02:37:18.400 --> 02:37:23.420]
When I wanted to know about not spending I'm not spending free golf. Yeah, I missed it. Did you really

[02:37:23.420 --> 02:37:29.000]
what happened? Peter's sister is the one that killed him. They're trying to make you think is paid

[02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:34.580]
but it's never the obvious person. But Peter's sister was talking about how he would still all the

[02:37:34.580 --> 02:37:40.080]
Joey donuts from them when they were kids. Yeah. And now she can have all the Joey donuts to herself. Oh,

[02:37:40.320 --> 02:37:44.680]
boy. That is the primary motive and it's going to come out in the end that he did it. Now let me

[02:37:44.680 --> 02:37:49.100]
ask you a question. Was Pat Peterson in the show Thursday? No, he was. Oh, good. Now I feel I

[02:37:49.100 --> 02:37:54.680]
feel so relieved because I missed the show. No, he wasn't. Boy, I've been so upset. Okay. I wish

[02:37:54.680 --> 02:37:59.220]
it had passed. I can't wait to wake up with you and then last my way all the way to work. Excellent.

[02:37:59.520 --> 02:38:03.820]
And do well. Now you do have an FM radio, right? Definitely. I know how to find you in the dog.

[02:38:03.960 --> 02:38:07.940]
Good. Thanks a lot. Combine it. Well, that's true. No, that's she's good because some of our

[02:38:07.940 --> 02:38:12.460]
callers don't know where to find it but that's another story. Well, listen, that's our last call on

[02:38:12.460 --> 02:38:17.480]
W. I. N. Z. And it's been interesting, right? It's a lie. I am not, but not see. That's what the

[02:38:17.480 --> 02:38:21.820]
memo says. It's been very interesting year and we think all of our list news for their loyal support.

[02:38:22.540 --> 02:38:27.540]
And all of those members of the cast awaited possible. We wish everybody on AM certain amount of

[02:38:27.540 --> 02:38:33.220]
success, especially from 10 a.m. to midnight, not too much in the morning from 6 a.m. But I have a

[02:38:33.220 --> 02:38:37.560]
feeling that it'll kind of seek its own level. It'll take care of itself. It'll take care of itself.

[02:38:37.560 --> 02:38:44.920]
We'll have a great time and don't forget Monday morning. Is it on FM? Monday, AM on FM at 6 o'clock

[02:38:44.920 --> 02:38:50.120]
on Zeta 94.9 and we're going to be doing all kinds of great things. And who knows what

[02:38:50.120 --> 02:38:54.440]
evalurcs in the hearts of men, right? Okay, stay tuned for Stan because he looks like he's really

[02:38:54.440 --> 02:38:56.860]
ready for another one of his favorite Saturday shows.

[02:38:59.820 --> 02:39:03.240]
You've been listening to the Neil Rogers show on W. I. N. Z.

[02:39:03.240 --> 02:39:07.080]
The views expressed on this program are those of the host guests and callers and are not

[02:39:07.080 --> 02:39:12.560]
necessarily those of W. I. N. Z. Stay tuned as the wins weekend continues with Stan Major.
