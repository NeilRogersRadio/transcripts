[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800]
You said you really have no, she's made me mad.

[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.760]
This is there, I want it.

[00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.100]
That was your story.

[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.980]
That was the scene of Adintora in public.

[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.660]
So what happened? Did you give her the magazine?

[00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:11.760]
Uh-huh, yeah.

[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.980]
I'll bet for 50 bucks worth of groceries, yeah.

[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.280]
I mean she wanted to threaten her, but she hadn't hurt you

[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.920]
or seen anything about it.

[00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.160]
And I wanted her and I said, now we're going to rendix it

[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.880]
because I understand there were taking them in too.

[00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.400]
Yeah.

[00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.780]
I guess this is funny and I just want to see what the reaction is.

[00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.840]
But the poor kids beyond the question they didn't know what to say.

[00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.140]
I think it's against piracy.

[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.200]
I think they're all trying to make a shop at Albertsons.

[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.340]
Oh, but they didn't know what to say.

[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.480]
They're there, they're there, they're there.

[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.440]
One girl said, let me see the magazine.

[00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.900]
I said you'll be interested in it.

[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.320]
I said because there's one there about breast,

[00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.040]
but I guess that's kind of dirty to say.

[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.700]
And the ladies, oh they got to be kicked out of it there.

[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.520]
Eating their sample ice cream cones and they're seen to us.

[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.340]
That's their fake.

[00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.720]
Maybe they ought to put them out next to the chicken breasts.

[00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.460]
And I don't know.

[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.940]
Okay.

[00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.960]
This is good to see you on me.

[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.460]
I'll bring somebody, Jonathan, that's definitely making difference.

[00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.780]
Yeah.

[00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.260]
Okay.

[00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.760]
Have a good day.

[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:00.260]
You too.

[00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.360]
26 before one.

[00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.660]
And of course, the next time you go shopping in public,

[00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.120]
just remember that FCC ruling.

[00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.440]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.960]
Hmm.

[00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.460]
About indecency, indecency with the bag boys, right?

[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.120]
And earrings and all that other stuff.

[00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.200]
Man, they got an excuse for everything over there, don't they?

[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.960]
Okay.

[00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.340]
We have two open lies in dates.

[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.880]
6249400 North Miami Beach, hello.

[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.040]
Hello now.

[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.700]
Yes.

[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.640]
Hey, a terrific program.

[00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.640]
But I'm listening to you for long time.

[00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.400]
Never called in but listening a long time.

[00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.140]
I'm an eight of here.

[00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.420]
Well, I wouldn't say a native.

[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.300]
I'm a pioneer at 57 years.

[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.560]
I don't want to mention who I am but you probably don't.

[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.060]
But I remember, there's one thing that you got to have.

[00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.260]
Remember, every knock is a boost.

[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.600]
And you're doing a hell of a compromise to your show.

[00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.360]
And it's enjoyable.

[00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.400]
In fact, I'm sitting here only on a Saturday listening to your program

[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.200]
and getting a hell of a pick out of all our door to wall stuff.

[00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.560]
Yeah, they're off the wall, all right.

[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.440]
And it's great.

[00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.400]
We're sleeping them off the wall.

[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.180]
Well, I do some television work and travel all over the country

[00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.340]
and I come contact with people from all over from the East Coast to the West Coast,

[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.900]
Mid-America, all in the WINGLIN.

[00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.540]
And your program is something else, isn't it?

[00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.400]
My air conditioning's been out four days.

[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.040]
I don't know.

[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.560]
Something's wrong about that.

[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.500]
They're waiting for a part.

[00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.720]
And I'm dying here.

[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.120]
My wife is going crazy.

[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.820]
It's so hot.

[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.500]
Fans are going, but it don't do no good.

[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.380]
But I can't miss your program.

[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.740]
And I'm sitting here and I'm getting off a great bang out of it.

[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.380]
You're terrific, though.

[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.300]
You're getting your great bangs, sir.

[00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.760]
Yeah.

[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.480]
Because the way you tiny speak row up, you're tiny line, you're telling where it is.

[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.040]
You stick up your principles, you make sense.

[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.960]
A lot of times you're, you know, you're far out.

[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.240]
But it's, it's, it's refreshing.

[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.000]
It's something that you don't get it anywhere.

[00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260]
And, uh, geez, I'm really impressed.

[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.560]
But I'm still sticking it out.

[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.360]
It's so hot here.

[00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.760]
I'm sweating like a pig.

[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.120]
But listening to your program, boy, it's really something else.

[00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.680]
Don't mind me.

[00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.780]
Okay.

[00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.500]
And, uh, you just keep on doing what you're doing.

[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.300]
You're going to be very kind to vice.

[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.160]
You'll miss people.

[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.180]
They don't agree with everything.

[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.000]
Of course.

[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.040]
You put it out.

[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.720]
What do they know?

[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.900]
It's a lipstick.

[00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.400]
Yeah.

[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.960]
And this is the truth.

[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.580]
I know.

[00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.200]
Don't you recognize my voice?

[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.520]
No.

[00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.520]
They call me the true-ish-aw-cheap bunker.

[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.780]
I did commercials with both of them.

[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:27.500]
I had a surprise.

[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.640]
I did my own commercials.

[00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.780]
Are you serious?

[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.340]
Yeah.

[00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:31.700]
You know who I am, right?

[00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:32.040]
I tell you.

[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.520]
Yeah.

[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.580]
I'll be burger.

[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.100]
You know, I'll be from 20 to 30, 37 years in one place.

[00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.220]
Are you kidding?

[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.840]
Hey, that's me.

[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.700]
Huh.

[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.320]
And, uh, I'm, uh, I'm a funny character myself.

[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.440]
I could tell.

[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.640]
But you ask me out.

[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.720]
I tell you.

[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.600]
You are my kind of people.

[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.140]
I know.

[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.380]
I live in North Miami Beach because it's very convenient for my wife when I go home.

[00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.700]
Well, nothing's perfect.

[00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:53.340]
You know that?

[00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.880]
Huh?

[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.860]
Nothing is perfect.

[00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.160]
Nothing is perfect.

[00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.600]
God.

[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.980]
People don't even like God.

[00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.880]
Some people love them.

[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.140]
Some people don't like God.

[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.500]
Exactly.

[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.760]
What the hell do they know?

[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.440]
You know, they're just a bunch of creeps.

[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.080]
A bunch of Michigan.

[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.360]
That's right.

[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.960]
Okay.

[00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.020]
You have to have a great life, sir.

[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.960]
I get what I told you.

[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.140]
Every knock is a post.

[00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.620]
Okay.

[00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:14.480]
Okay.

[00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:15.420]
Audio.

[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.040]
Audio.

[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.080]
Hostel Owego.

[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.960]
Hostel Owego.

[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.400]
Okay.

[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.980]
When I cry.

[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.060]
And in the course of things, after we had, and that was quite a traumatic thing for me as well.

[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:38.100]
Each time I saw the time, take our love with us.

[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:39.340]
Okay.

[00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.160]
It's 22 before 1.

[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.360]
I'm not even stopping the car.

[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.920]
It's well today.

[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.440]
That's how disjointed the show has become.

[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.060]
Let's do our second break of the hour.

[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:55.300]
If you're keeping track at home, the guys who have the subred hot dog stands are going to be selling hot dogs in the shape of the Pope's beanie.

[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.160]
They're going to call them beanie weemies.

[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.440]
19 before, well, look at that.

[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.260]
I think that's an omen.

[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.720]
I think that just fell on the floor back there.

[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.460]
19 before 1 at W.I. and Z.

[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.200]
Our next call in coconut creek.

[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.700]
Hello.

[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.340]
Good afternoon, Neil.

[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.120]
Yes, sir.

[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.300]
You know, this is another, I'm going to call it a disagreement for you.

[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.940]
I enjoy listening to you every day.

[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.840]
But I just want, I want to ask you a question.

[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:20.960]
I don't want to cut me off.

[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.140]
I want to respond to you.

[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.400]
You talk about the people that listen to you.

[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.560]
How stupid they are and the American public is dummies and there's 240 million in the end of the fall.

[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.020]
No, I didn't, I never said that.

[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.680]
I didn't say that everybody's an end of the fall.

[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.240]
That's what you mean to imply.

[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.180]
Did you ever stop to think that maybe, you know, this is the 80s.

[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.000]
It's not the 60s or 70s anymore.

[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.660]
And you're the one that's not a set.

[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.960]
People have finally come to their senses and realize.

[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.540]
Well, then what are you listening for?

[00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.780]
Well, because I enjoy you.

[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.140]
I like to listen to you a lot.

[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.600]
I like to listen to you a lot.

[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.520]
I like the way you cut people off that disagree with you.

[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.940]
Okay.

[00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.160]
18 before 1 at W.I. and Z.

[00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.860]
Plantation.

[00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.180]
Hello.

[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.200]
Hello.

[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.700]
Yes.

[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.820]
Oh, hi.

[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:02.360]
How are you doing?

[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.180]
What plant was he calling?

[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.440]
Well, he said he liked the way that I cut off people to disagree.

[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.220]
So I figured I'd, you know, give him what he wanted.

[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.320]
So to speak.

[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.620]
I don't know about the FCC.

[00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.580]
I'm looking at pornography while I'm talking to you.

[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.460]
Well, the next time you go to public sir, just keep that FCC ruling in mind.

[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.300]
What is it?

[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.720]
When you go to the meat department.

[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.160]
You have to watch your meat, is that it?

[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.620]
Exactly.

[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.740]
Oh, I got it.

[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.100]
Those little old ladies out there who have been squeezing the meat at publics look out.

[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.840]
Oh.

[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.060]
The FCC inspector may be standing under the counter.

[00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:35.360]
That's right.

[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.480]
Well, there are no castitution in public.

[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.020]
I was in Sarasota this week.

[00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.940]
There are no human rights in public.

[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.400]
No human rights.

[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:44.120]
No humans.

[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.800]
The radio in Sarasota is...

[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.380]
Pretty exciting.

[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.280]
Oh, my God.

[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:50.860]
Awful.

[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:51.720]
I used to work there.

[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.420]
You're kidding.

[00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.960]
14 years ago, I worked at WSPB out there on City Island.

[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:56.700]
Doing what?

[00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:58.520]
What do you mean doing what?

[00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:59.360]
I did a morning show.

[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.640]
I was program director.

[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.220]
I did a talk show for a while.

[00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.300]
I did everything out there.

[00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.580]
They don't have anything even closely resembling a talk show out there.

[00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:07.920]
No.

[00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.460]
They have a lot of shows like Mike Rennery in the morning.

[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.260]
Yeah, guys picked their nose on the ear.

[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:13.720]
That's good.

[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.780]
Play disgusting music.

[00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.420]
And the FM's awful also.

[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.940]
I mean, not that Miami's great, but their idea of FM is light rock.

[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:28.300]
They have all these stations that play an elevator type of rock and roll.

[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:28.940]
It was awful.

[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:29.920]
Yeah.

[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.440]
Like the Hollywood string saying, playing, I want your sex.

[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:34.020]
Not?

[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.400]
Well, I don't know about that.

[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.220]
Not in...

[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.920]
...out of that going on.

[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.300]
Buy it out there.

[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.360]
How bad can it be without the lyrics, you know?

[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:43.340]
I know.

[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.320]
I don't think George Michael makes it to Sarasota.

[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:46.580]
Probably not.

[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.360]
Can I say...

[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.680]
I was listening to Craig Worthing when he...

[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.400]
Well, that's obscene in and of itself, sir.

[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.180]
Well, that's history, but I haven't had a chance to call you.

[00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:03.600]
And he used to be on and he was like the most enane individual in the world.

[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:09.600]
He would get a guess on why I don't know and ask them about their shoes...

[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.120]
...about the clothes they were wearing.

[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.580]
Well, he's big into shoes and clothing.

[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:13.820]
I don't understand.

[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:14.480]
He gets...

[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.900]
And why do people even sit there?

[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.020]
They'll talk about a topic and he talks about his dreams or what he did 20 years ago.

[00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:21.780]
I doubt that.

[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:22.800]
The guy...

[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.400]
I doubt that very much.

[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:25.200]
You don't think so.

[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:25.480]
No.

[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:26.800]
Anyway.

[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:27.400]
Yeah.

[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:28.660]
He would be right along.

[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:29.640]
Moving right along.

[00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:31.300]
What's...

[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.560]
What other thing about Alice in the afternoon?

[00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:35.020]
Yes.

[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.900]
Is he getting ready to like come out of the closet or something?

[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:43.260]
All his shoes seem to be drag queens, etc., etc., etc.

[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.480]
What's his...

[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.620]
Is that his new shock type of programming?

[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.160]
Yeah, he's a shock-jock.

[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.460]
He's a shock to listen to.

[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.000]
I don't know what the story is there.

[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:54.720]
I'm not really sure.

[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.120]
It's kind of like one day the Toys on the Line and...

[00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.900]
Remember that song, One Two Over the Line?

[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:00.800]
Yes.

[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.220]
Well, I think that ought to be the theme song and I'd show.

[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.640]
She can't say that on the air.

[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:04.900]
No.

[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:09.880]
Anyway, I really like your Tammy Fei piece.

[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.660]
Yeah, that's a classic.

[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.780]
Am I record or you'll die in hell or something burning hell?

[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.840]
That's their whole...

[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.520]
Their whole ballgame.

[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:18.960]
Exactly.

[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:20.240]
Give me money or...

[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.120]
Ah, your way to heaven.

[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.460]
I'm gonna...

[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:23.780]
One last question.

[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:24.540]
What is...

[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.880]
I know AOR means all over the road.

[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.040]
What does that mean?

[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.520]
What does what mean?

[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:31.260]
AOR...

[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.640]
What is all over the road mean?

[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.060]
No, no.

[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.900]
That's just my line all over the road.

[00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.640]
AOR means adult-oriented rock, album rock.

[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.580]
Oh, oh, oh, okay, great.

[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:40.380]
Very good.

[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:40.620]
Yeah.

[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:41.540]
Thanks a lot, Neil.

[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.860]
I do enjoy your program.

[00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:43.380]
Okay.

[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:43.840]
Goodbye.

[00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:44.740]
See you in Sarasota.

[00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:45.320]
Goodbye.

[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.260]
Okay, Geno is calling.

[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.660]
He feels...

[00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:51.040]
Lonely.

[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:51.740]
Who's Geno?

[00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:55.280]
Genes Stevens?

[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.520]
No, come on.

[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.180]
Get serious.

[00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.200]
He wants me to talk about him again.

[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.080]
Genes Silverman.

[00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:03.060]
You're Genes Silverman.

[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:03.800]
How you doing, Eugene?

[00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.320]
He's not really calling, is he?

[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:07.760]
What does he want?

[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:09.800]
He's on the phone?

[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:14.700]
How do you know it was him?

[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.880]
Was there silverware dripping from his telephone?

[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.340]
Or was it just jewelry dripping from the phone?

[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:22.940]
One or the other.

[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.060]
Okay, that's fascinating.

[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:25.440]
Hollywood, hello.

[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:26.220]
Hi, Neil.

[00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:26.700]
Yeah.

[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.560]
I was watching by accident.

[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.620]
I watched Jimmy Swagger this morning.

[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.720]
And you know, you have to watch the enemy so you can combat him.

[00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:37.000]
You have to know what you're doing, you know?

[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.780]
I had a greed to do that.

[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:41.940]
Before I left the room, he asked the question,

[00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.040]
do you think I could ever come back to PTO?

[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:44.880]
Go ahead, sir.

[00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:48.620]
Well, you believe that he had this chart up,

[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:53.280]
and he was showing the enemies of TV evangelists,

[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.680]
and he had pornographers, he had humanists,

[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:57.700]
and you know, different columns.

[00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:58.280]
Yeah.

[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.100]
He had Thomas Payne.

[00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.020]
He had the Catholic...

[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:07.660]
the Catholic denomination up there right along with pornographers and humanists.

[00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:08.600]
Yeah, that's true.

[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.340]
They were very down on the Catholics.

[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.080]
You bet.

[00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:12.540]
Can you believe that?

[00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:12.980]
Yes.

[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.500]
And not only that, he was showing all, you know,

[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.120]
how the money is spent, how he spends his money.

[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:24.080]
And he was saying that, you know, he was showing these South American countries,

[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.220]
these people in South America, you know,

[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:27.880]
flocking to the stadiums and seeing them.

[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.720]
I think they were probably passing out free hot dogs or something to everybody.

[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:31.700]
Meenie Wienys.

[00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:32.660]
Right.

[00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:37.540]
And he says, yeah, even people down in South America watch our show.

[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:41.880]
And they had the cameras inside like these straw huts,

[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.960]
and there's dirt floors, and there's poverty, and...

[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.640]
Yeah, but they all have a 26-inch Sony.

[00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:47.440]
Don't you understand?

[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.460]
I pray you a 26-inch color party.

[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.860]
It's a matter of priorities.

[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.360]
How can you believe that?

[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:52.720]
Yeah.

[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:53.480]
A joke.

[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:54.820]
What, a joke?

[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.780]
And you believe that the people that watch him are gullible enough to believe that?

[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.420]
Somebody wanted me to talk about Gene Stevens.

[00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.520]
If I have the guts, what do they want me to talk about other than he's a douchebag?

[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:08.420]
What is there to say?

[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.800]
I'm sorry, sir. I'm getting a message here.

[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.020]
It's just unbelievable.

[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.260]
Go ahead. I'm used to it.

[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:14.160]
No, there's nothing to say.

[00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.740]
I mean, I've already said it all about Gene Stevens.

[00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:17.700]
He's a douchebag.

[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.500]
I don't know who Gene Stevens is.

[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.300]
Well, believe me. Nobody else does either.

[00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:26.140]
Well, if you don't like him, I probably wouldn't either.

[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.740]
He's a misfit and halemdale.

[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.100]
Oh, boy. That tells me a lot right there.

[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.340]
That says it all.

[00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:33.500]
That says it all.

[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:40.460]
Hey, Benille. If you could, could you play that human gas alert?

[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.160]
If you get a chance, would you please?

[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:43.640]
Human gas alert?

[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:47.400]
You know, that one that the siren goes off on people's gas gas.

[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.740]
That little sticky have there.

[00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.260]
You mean the worst alert?

[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.220]
I haven't heard it too. I heard it one time.

[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.240]
And I didn't remember exactly what it was.

[00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.180]
I heard it was pretty funny.

[00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:01.240]
The point is, though, if you're going to ask for bits, you've got to have the name right.

[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.500]
So for future reference, I'm just stalling for time because I can't find it.

[00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:07.360]
I'll find it here sooner or later.

[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.080]
It's called the worst alert.

[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:10.300]
The worst alert.

[00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:11.380]
I'll remember that, Neil.

[00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:11.960]
Thank you, Laura.

[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:16.440]
In fact, that comes automatically on your radio just before the leaf followers show every morning.

[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.180]
And afterwards, too.

[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.760]
But I'll just before Mike Thompson.

[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.480]
Oh, here it is.

[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.500]
Okay, boy, I'll tell you.

[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.260]
You chuckle just right up to it.

[00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:26.720]
Okay, have a good day.

[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:27.220]
Later.

[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:27.840]
See you later.

[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:31.180]
Boy, great killing, honey.

[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:32.160]
Oh, Mike, there.

[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:37.800]
At worst alert, we know the key to surviving household accidents is early warning.

[00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.480]
Yeah, boy, I just loped them beans.

[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:41.960]
Oh, no!

[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:43.400]
Come on, kids.

[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.580]
Help out with nothing, winter.

[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.160]
I don't want to see.

[00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:48.740]
It was a dog that done it.

[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:55.720]
When the worst happens, worst alert is there, constantly sniffing the air for those silent but deadly personal humans.

[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.900]
It's the worst alert.

[00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.520]
Personal fume detector.

[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.300]
What weapon you're off it?

[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.660]
Meathers, I need this 200 page report in one hour.

[00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:05.540]
What?

[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.560]
An open window.

[00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:09.520]
What one in your car, dude?

[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.780]
Hey, thank you for reading a burrito to Paul, man.

[00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.420]
Hey, thank you.

[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.900]
Get automatically lowers your window.

[00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:18.640]
Limit.

[00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:20.080]
Close your windows.

[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.120]
The worst alert.

[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.000]
Personal fume detector.

[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.060]
Available now with gas modern all cheeseway stores.

[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:33.700]
I said, well, Jim, I understand the assemblies of God are about to defraud you.

[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.000]
Okay, it's nine minutes before one at WING.

[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.480]
Let's take our last break this hour, because I think we're finally...

[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.240]
I'll tell you one thing.

[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.280]
It's one thing, you know, when people want to hear things.

[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.240]
It's another thing when they become militant.

[00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:46.060]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.220]
And we have a couple of people.

[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.540]
Well, we have several people, I guess, for whatever the reason.

[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:53.260]
I want to hear Helen DeLvice and the Leopard Condom today.

[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.940]
And I think what we ought to do is play them back to back to get those people off our backs.

[00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:01.500]
But I'm a little bit nervous, because I don't want to stop these carts,

[00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.020]
and I'm not sure if Jerry has recued.

[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.600]
I would never have been able to do this.

[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.720]
I would never have been able to do this.

[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:13.860]
I would never have been able to do this.

[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.520]
I would never have been able to do this.

[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.560]
Can you believe that?

[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:26.580]
They both ended.

[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.580]
That's the second time that's happened.

[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.700]
It must be the work of the Lord.

[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.500]
They both ended simultaneously.

[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.840]
There two Miami cops with a hot newbie.

[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.380]
They're on the street, sliding crime.

[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.140]
They pop into any cabin space there.

[00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:50.900]
In Helen DeLvice.

[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:51.880]
We got a problem.

[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.780]
The grey gang is a cruel treat.

[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:59.220]
Lieutenant, isn't that the group of senior citizens who went around trying to get the early bird special after seven?

[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:00.520]
Yeah, they're backing down.

[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:01.680]
Let's go get them.

[00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:06.040]
Yes, stop it, nothing to clean out this treat.

[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.560]
Hey, lady, you can't cross here. You'll have to cross in the light.

[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.920]
They're determined to clean up this mudling business.

[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.220]
All right, sister, you're under arrest.

[00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:18.380]
Oh, so now you're under arresting my wife. Watch the charge.

[00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:19.620]
Session of powder.

[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.020]
I'm gonna have first time.

[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.000]
Let's see that wife stuff.

[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.840]
Yeah, just a dog.

[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.980]
She's got over 100 bags in here.

[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:26.720]
Of what?

[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:27.920]
Sweet and low.

[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:30.240]
From that restaurant, she just came out of.

[00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:31.240]
What's that gonna mean?

[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:36.840]
Yes, there can be Miami cops on a hot newbie.

[00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:39.280]
In Helen DeLvice.

[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.400]
We're being disformed on MBC.

[00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:47.220]
No, this is the time of year when everyone's a wee bit.

[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:47.800]
I wish.

[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:52.780]
Say, Colleen, would you be wanting to come over to my place to help me wax my shell?

[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.940]
Oh, now that I would, my catastrophe.

[00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:58.060]
If you'd be wet in the green.

[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.820]
I know there's a smart lassie.

[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:07.440]
Please make sure her lad is wearing the Kelly Green protection of leprechaundoms.

[00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:10.220]
Don't be whistin' on a poorly clover.

[00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.180]
I'll file in for the gist of gab.

[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:15.720]
Especially if you're planning on kissing some blindy stones.

[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.040]
There's what have you.

[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:21.620]
Be doubly in your protection with the imprecondoms.

[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.280]
They're strong enough for a man.

[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.240]
But I like them too.

[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:28.100]
So kick yourself a leprechaundom.

[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.480]
And you won't be catching anything else.

[00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.620]
Are you gonna be pulling my leg? Are you serious?

[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.440]
Okay, I wish I could repeat that.

[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.720]
I might repeat that on Monday.

[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.580]
Five minutes before 1 at WYNZ.

[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:44.700]
We have somebody in a pay phone on County Line Road. Hello.

[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:45.020]
Hey, Neil.

[00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:47.360]
Real uplifting show early this morning.

[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:48.780]
Yeah, real positive.

[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.920]
I got a question for you. It's kind of a cubic servicie.

[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.840]
You might be going for the betters going out to Caldera.

[00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:55.780]
I just got back from there.

[00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.380]
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.100]
You just got back from there. Post time isn't for another five minutes.

[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.040]
Wait a minute. It's 12.30. The wind is open.

[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.140]
Oh, I see another. Would you bet early?

[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:07.160]
Yeah, I went in about 25 out there and got out of there.

[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.180]
Well, I can't believe it. We got an honest guy here.

[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.280]
He didn't bet with his bookie. He went to the track and advanced bet.

[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.380]
I can't believe it.

[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.120]
I'm doing it for a bunch of other people.

[00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.620]
Oh, well, that's illegal. That's good.

[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.620]
I was like, you know, oh, I know what I'm talking about.

[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:20.980]
I'm gonna go and make all your bets for you.

[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.160]
You know, they just told me their names.

[00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.860]
And here's what happens. There's a few horses that are coupled together.

[00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:27.780]
And I didn't, I'm not testing that line.

[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:32.880]
But what does that mean? I mean, I can win if two of the same trainers, you know,

[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.380]
if either the horses win or something like that.

[00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.540]
Exactly. Of course, there are, you mean in the Belmont?

[00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.420]
Exactly. That's the only race I bet on.

[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.640]
Okay. Let's just say, for example, gone west,

[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:45.240]
if that comes in or conchiste rows comes in, you win either?

[00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:49.000]
Right. But that just seems like you're getting my two horses for the price of one.

[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.680]
You are. It's an entry. That's what an entry is all about.

[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.120]
That's why the price is usually fairly low on an entry

[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:57.860]
because you got two chances. Just like Goliocasteri and Goltra,

[00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.160]
the Leroy Gioli entry.

[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.900]
Exactly. Conchiste rows in Gone West are the Woody Stevens entry.

[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.520]
Yeah, because I like boxed. Also perfect, crypto clearance and Leo Castell.

[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:12.120]
But also a big gulch effect comes in with I guess either those two horses exactly about that

[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.960]
Okay, so I'll be able to explain it intelligently anyways

[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:19.440]
Yeah, when you start when you tell these people you have the terror or tickets up you'll be able to tell them why and

[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.820]
Well, I'll tell the people if there's if they go in with like the

[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.580]
The line up out of the paper that it's totally wrong

[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:29.980]
You go in there and say I want the number 10 it's you know gulch and paper. It's totally wrong

[00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:33.520]
So there's any light novice better. Well those are by post position

[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.640]
faculty and that's not how they're listed in the Belmont program

[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:41.360]
So something you know gonna be betting on the totally wrong board so they just go through a number's around so that's true

[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:46.540]
That's why you got to buy a program. I know it you know it costs 50 cents. It's a big investment, but it's a good idea

[00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:51.920]
Yeah, I just took it in the day county, but now I'm making a mad dash back to Brown. You're right on the line

[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:57.660]
Huh? Yeah, sir just like those tacos to hover on the line right here by this beautiful shopping center

[00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:03.320]
Boy, it's just a terrible part of town, but I'm getting out of here. Okay, stop in Royal Castle on the way back

[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.640]
That'll change your luck. See you after a minute. Okay. Good luck to you

[00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.220]
Okay, they're all plunging their guts out man. That's good

[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:14.280]
He went out there early and plunged and got everybody else's money down which is you know borderline illegal

[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:20.320]
Technically, but at least he admits it. Okay, when we come back after the news break we're gonna really go nuts and

[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:26.340]
I have no idea what that means, but see it always sounds good when you say that like we're gonna really have a like last

[00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:31.040]
What the hell they wasn't it was like two Saturdays ago on Friday

[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.960]
I said tomorrow we're really gonna have a wild show

[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:38.240]
Or we've got something wild prepared for I have anything prepared as usual you know the last few months

[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.980]
You don't prepare anything you just come in and fly by the seat of your pants

[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.220]
Which is why the seat of my pants are so shiny these days

[00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:50.040]
See Larry can't

[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:55.860]
No, do I want to get into that again about these chairs now? Well, it's too big of a story to cover in the next 30 seconds

[00:20:55.860 --> 00:21:02.420]
We'll save that for Monday about Larry can't in these chairs in the talk studio. I mean several of them

[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.240]
At the same time

[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.520]
Anyway, we will come back at 106 and then of course Ernie's

[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:12.880]
Neil Rogers. Yeah, Arlene. I was the one at the watered up that stupid crap and put it in the waist basket. Okay, honey

[00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.200]
Can we get her a little therapy before she does the next update?

[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:22.500]
It's 106 at W. I. N. Z. I'm telling you we've got just incredible. I mean during the week

[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:27.940]
It's wild enough, but on the weekend. It's just like out of control out of control

[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:35.680]
Like I really have a lot to do with the programming of this radio station, right? I have everything to do with it

[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:40.140]
You know anything that go when it rains outside. It's Neil's fault. Everything is Neil

[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:45.640]
Now I guess we're supposed to forget about the numbers and about the ratings and about listening

[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:50.740]
We're not here to build an audience. We're here to be a little fraternity, right? Of course

[00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:54.680]
To be just a little psychotic fraternity and I certainly qualify

[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:57.040]
Because I'm a psychotic is almost

[00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:02.140]
Anybody in a building I do underline almost because there are some in a class by themselves

[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:05.640]
Okay, we have one open line at Dade County 624

[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:07.420]
9400

[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:09.180]
624

[00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.560]
9400 Miami. Hello

[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:14.720]
Hello, yes

[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:16.320]
Neil your

[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:22.320]
Defensive freedom of speech and self expression with the FCC is very lottable

[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:29.680]
But I can't understand it seems inconsistent with your your concern about the Pope's coming or about selling souvenirs

[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:36.640]
What's the difference yes if they sell souvenirs for his visit? What's different between that and selling Bruce Springsteen

[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.820]
pictures and

[00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:39.220]
people

[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:46.620]
What's the what's difference be what between selling souvenirs when the Pope comes and all those little souvenirs that they sell on the PT

[00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:47.020]
Club

[00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:51.040]
Well, you know, if I mean is it is a

[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:55.080]
Markument that you have though about if you don't like the programming one can turn it off

[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:58.980]
I didn't say that we're starting a campaign to stop they can do any damn thing they want

[00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:02.060]
You know, I'm making a joke out of it and you're obviously taking it very seriously

[00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:04.180]
Which I find amusing in itself?

[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.880]
Well, it may be it is amusing, but it's it's silly the if

[00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:15.420]
People whether you believe in them or not, you know, they sell a little souvenir posters anytime a visitor from Israel comes no

[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:20.820]
They don't you know, it's no they don't yeah, they do they sell a little flags and they know they don't

[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:24.160]
Anytime a visitor from Israel comes I don't mean to Miami

[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.620]
I mean if they come to New York haven't you been in New York when

[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:30.720]
When Monachican menachan bacon or seen the footage or when

[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:36.760]
Nobody comes over no and they don't let the kids out of school when Monachan bacon comes to or when Yitzhak Shamir

[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:41.600]
Comes to in New York they don't let the kids out of school. Are you jealous because they do now?

[00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:44.680]
I'm not jealous. It's got nothing to do with what I'm jealous. It's ridiculous

[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:49.900]
It's the violation of separation of church in state. I mean you're approaching like a child in my jealous

[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:53.740]
It sounds like you're all upset about it and oh yeah, sir

[00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:57.560]
I'm so upset about it. You know, I mentioned it. What do we spend about two minutes on that?

[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:02.220]
Well at least two minutes when is worse things can happen and you turn it off if you don't like it

[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:06.360]
You don't buy it if you don't like it. What is that? I continue with letting the kids out of school when a Pope comes

[00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:11.720]
Well if if the kids if people feel that the kids are

[00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:14.980]
Going to get something out of it fine and they what are they going to get out of it?

[00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:19.000]
Just to go. They know. They're going to get out of it. Get worse things. What are they going to get out of it?

[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.460]
You know, it sounds a lot like you're not you don't want to have a conversation

[00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:25.960]
You said if the kids are going to get something I asked you a question you pretend you're deaf

[00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:31.520]
What are they going to get out of it? The kids going to get out of long hair mother's used to say when the Beatles were were new

[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:37.400]
What does that have to do with getting out of school when the Pope is here if the Beatles were coming to town if they were still together

[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:41.360]
They wouldn't be out of school when the Beatles came. I'll

[00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:44.140]
Please spare me the pain will you?

[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:47.680]
Everybody in the audience you are remember when the Beatles used to come to town

[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:52.180]
We used to have a school holiday right so all the kids like when Elvis used to come to the

[00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:54.420]
Convention Center

[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:58.220]
Did he ever come to the convention center could be who knows?

[00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:00.980]
But certainly if he would have we would let all the kids out of school

[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:05.780]
I mean this guy is just totally irrational and taking it all so seriously

[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:10.660]
That's a bottom line pal the whole thing is a big joke only we just don't want to subsidize it and

[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.200]
Thank goodness that the school board in Broward County and the

[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:19.340]
Superintendent of Public Schools has enough guts to say no to the Pope

[00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:24.000]
Humor first you get down on your knees

[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.940]
It'll win your rosaries

[00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:37.520]
Okay, one twelve and W. I. Z. I've got most of the lines are open now and of course

[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.120]
That's been the kind of day

[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:42.940]
It's been not that we haven't had a lot of calls because we did earlier although most of them were really depressing

[00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:47.340]
But the audience today, man, they're just they're on the rag

[00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:51.260]
You know, I don't know if it's the Vatican rag or which rag it is, but they're on some kind of a wreck

[00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:57.820]
We have an open line in dayed 624 9400 and our new new number in Broward is 524

[00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:01.720]
9400 deep throat. Hello. How you doing?

[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:05.220]
I'll see we don't get any meal here on Saturday, so I'm sure it'll show up on Monday

[00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:11.500]
Or at least I hope it shows up on Monday. I've also got Jack 30 lament on there. He might be able to use good

[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:13.380]
That was long

[00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:18.900]
Forgot about that one. Yeah

[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:26.160]
Okay, well it sounds like I'm in for a real treat on Monday morning. Hey look. I'm going back after this show

[00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:32.680]
I'm through my first time a call there really yeah, I usually play highlight and I usually win

[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.000]
Mm-hmm call the shots

[00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:40.920]
You got any you know I'll give anything out today. No, I don't know I don't do that anymore. That's right. Okay

[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.980]
Well all I can tell you is I like the

[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.020]
Leroy Jolly entry in the Belmont and it's not going to pay anything

[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:50.600]
Okay, I didn't hear that Leo Castellan Gulch

[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:51.440]
Gulch

[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.880]
But it's not going to pay much

[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.260]
That's okay. One of the pay my for that

[00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:01.440]
Well wait a minute. I see perfect parade is running again today in the eighth race on the grass

[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:04.560]
Okay, look out

[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:10.860]
Thanks me up. Okay, good luck. I can't believe that I happen to have the entries right in front of me here

[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:18.200]
I'm not touting anything, but I gave him my last week and he won rather easily and it looks basically like it's the same field again

[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:22.380]
Or at least a lot of the same ones Texola Joe and per playho he beat him before

[00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:30.240]
London exchange Canadian winner pretty much the same field so look out in the eighth race

[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:38.380]
Miami hello, hey Neil how you doing today? Okay? All right. Well, it's amazing some of these people they call actually probably have drivers licenses

[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:38.980]
I know

[00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:41.020]
Geez, I

[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:47.220]
Hey, you know speaking of the Catholics. I just you know, I went to Catholic school in Ohio and

[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:52.460]
My buddies mom used to clean up the rectory or wherever they lived, you know

[00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:57.540]
And she always used to find all kinds of used rubbers and I mean use condoms in the

[00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:01.040]
In the waste baskets and stuff

[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.760]
Nons used to drop out of school be a pregnant

[00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:11.580]
About 25% of the priests were gay, which I don't have a figure can't wait wait wait wait what percent about 25 oh

[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:19.300]
Man, that's you know, which is five with me. That's a low figure. Let me tell you you know speaking of maybe 95%

[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:21.420]
Well, I didn't want to go that high but

[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:30.100]
25% like you were gay, which is fine and the funniest thing out of all there was the head done choose the principal to the school

[00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:34.520]
The head none. Yeah, the head none. What kind of meat to precede on Friday none

[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:38.440]
Moving right along

[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.040]
Okay

[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:43.640]
Any of this

[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:52.620]
Head had none there got knocked up by the basketball coach. I just thought that was funny as could be two old two old goobers

[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:54.180]
We're good to do it the head office

[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:03.480]
Well ever good day Neil. Why did she give birth to a little basketball? I guess yeah, my mom told me this

[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:11.060]
Okay, well, it must be true then later. Okay, it's 118 at W. I. N. Z. But it I feel like I'm on

[00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:16.440]
What about 33 RPM today like the show is on 16 or something, you know, maybe it's just me

[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:20.520]
We have an open line indeed and a 624 9400

[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:27.860]
Somebody said that he saw on entertainment tonight that Pat and Anita will be doing a music and promo tour for Anita's book

[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.200]
Rising from the ashes

[00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:33.560]
Well, that's exciting I

[00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:37.920]
Understand that the pat is contributing the photographs in the insert

[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.680]
119 at W. I. N. Z.

[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:49.320]
122 at W. I. N. Don't forget psychotic news headlines coming up at the top of the hour and then we'll have

[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:54.580]
The Ernie Sochin long from two to seven. What are you laughing about? This is the honest show. I'm just telling it like it is

[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.380]
Is a matter of fact last five minutes?

[00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:03.880]
I'm gonna laugh and puke in the claw of the wall and make guttural sounds and you know because we want a good buildup

[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:09.440]
Boy, this cigar is getting to me. I'm telling you it's either cigar the show or a combination of both. What do you want? Are you?

[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:11.440]
You must want something

[00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:16.140]
What is it more gossip?

[00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:20.140]
The W. I. N. Z. Yenta rent the Yenta is in the building again

[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:23.100]
He didn't create enough problem here this morning

[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:29.500]
Merit Island always at the island of Merit Steerheim bought

[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.200]
I'm reading the letter folks who just

[00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:40.340]
Cool it. He's a life member of the NRA and a reader of the spotlight

[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:44.340]
He also reads New York Times in Washington Post

[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:53.880]
Oh boy

[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:54.060]
Oh boy

[00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:55.860]
Oh boy

[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:05.420]
They're discussing an envelope. Yeah, we sent him a boom box

[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:12.020]
What is shame if I didn't know that I would have turned the envelope up. What an idiot Merit Island

[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:19.840]
Yeah, there a lot of open-minded progressive people on Merit Island probably drives a pickup truck. Yeah, he's got designer sheets

[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.740]
Not on not on his bed either

[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:27.940]
Boy pathetic. He's almost as sick as somebody I know in the newsroom

[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:33.320]
Okay, where are we going next? Hey listen? I've just only begun. I mean you know if they want to start with me

[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:38.460]
Trust me. I can do six weeks on her. You know what I'm saying with that non-stop no problem

[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:44.940]
You know just do the job and shut up honey. That's all we want no more psychosis in the bitching and belly aching

[00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:52.660]
You know this is a business we hear to succeed to get numbers to build an audience not to a pacify people psychosis, right?

[00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:58.740]
Oh wait a minute here comes a message. Oh, she's a personality could have fooled the hell out of me

[00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:05.100]
Pembroke pines. Hello. Hi Neil. Yes. I hear a plan of free-pakers hanging around. So is this true?

[00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:09.680]
On the phone together. Yeah

[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:16.020]
Oh, you've got to be kidding now do you think that I'm gonna be watching Don web on channel 17

[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:27.660]
No, it's pretty good

[00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:29.920]
I have a lot of old footage and Steve Allen together

[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.460]
It's pretty funny. Huh pretty weird

[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:34.980]
Almost as funny as Ted Coppel

[00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:40.680]
Are you using a cheap phone

[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:50.400]
Sounds like you've got it stuffed in somewhere. I'm not sure where real muffled. Oh you had it there earlier

[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.660]
Yeah, something must have got on it

Very big up there. Oh, I'm pretty big down here, too

[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:06.940]
If you add in this week's voice or next week's voice this week

[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:14.840]
I've been looking I look to the issue. I plan has been too busy spreading rumors around the building to get one

[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:21.780]
Well, I got the tune nine. Yeah, radio hell on the cover. I didn't see anything about it. I didn't see the add anywhere

[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:24.640]
Maybe you're lucky to be in that week

[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:30.120]
Well, have a good life. No. Well, what does that mean you the June 9th this week

[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:36.720]
They come in a magazine to come out they take a lot of the stand the of the date that's on the cover

[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:41.420]
Yeah, who when comes out on Tuesday and there's no add in there for so far all through it

[00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:47.380]
I see it look everywhere in the head. Yeah, well, that's Glenn's he Glenn is right on top of these things

[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:52.120]
I think also good that's he's so busy giving rumors to fruitcake that he doesn't have time to take care of this stuff

[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.620]
Well, it's a good issue to read anyway

[00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:59.380]
It's got to be exciting out on the york radio and oh that'll be exciting out

[00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:03.020]
This is a busy issue to be into about radio hell

[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:09.440]
I'm about to speak with different or to everybody's really good. You know I take anything to get on the chief phone

[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:14.680]
Get a new phone will you play seriously get a new phone? All right, bye. Okay. That was pathetic

That it might be true. Yeah

[00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:01.140]
Exactly

[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:03.580]
So you got more rumors for us well

[00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:08.180]
I we heard that the rumors were denied an IOD yesterday. They came on here. It's a name. It's not true

[00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:10.920]
We're still here. Yeah, and you hear about all the

[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:16.020]
Circle phone calls they had at the station the old ladies yeah old bags. That's their whole IOD audience over there

[00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:20.180]
They got about ten old bags. They did have the big meeting yesterday and

[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:26.180]
Part of the wait a minute which one the big program maybe the meeting between Rick Edwards and

You know we talked about it all yesterday. Who?

[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:36.160]
Cain

[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:41.000]
We don't mention him anymore. That's right. We don't recognize him. That's okay. Yeah

[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:44.400]
Just refer to him as the Desisto school host

[00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:51.800]
Can't wait for how to raise your children and make them hate your guts just run around in front of them naked all day that's all

[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:57.540]
I can't wait for his wrestling shows. Oh, yeah, those would be your favorites. Yeah anyway

[00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:01.360]
Part of the part of the queens and tights running around that's great

[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:04.540]
Go ahead. I'm sorry part

[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:10.460]
Part of the media why can't you ever get these things out? We invite you to come on here and you go on and on and

[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:14.120]
Get into everything except the meat of the matter. Why can't you ever get to the point?

[00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:18.080]
You're one of the biggest obfuscators you just dropped this smoke screen this cloud

[00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:20.440]
Right and hang it over the truth

[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:25.020]
I just come and write out and delaying it on the line and being a concise and precise

[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:28.480]
Specific do like they do in the newsroom, you know

[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.880]
You remember the newsroom we used to have all those people in there taking a salary

[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:37.220]
You know me of course. I'm trying to get rid of all those people. That's the latest rumor. It's all his fault

[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:39.100]
He hates the news

[00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:43.200]
It feels to be like I love

[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:46.660]
And I love hearing that news over and over and over again

[00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:51.380]
I love it when they get on the year and laugh a lot. What is that if you got the new sounder? No, don't do that

[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:55.600]
Wait until about 159 and crank it up full blast open the pot wide open

[00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:02.720]
The teletype. Oh, you've got the old teletype. Is that come back or is that the new teletype the new one?

[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:07.500]
Forget it. I want to hear fingernail scratching on the blackboard. I'll do my own on this blackboard

[00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:15.760]
Now get to it will you please what is it that you want to tell us spit it out a part troublemaker of the meeting that they had yesterday?

[00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:19.040]
Oh, had the WIOK. All right. Let's first of all

[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:25.180]
Let's realize that the people who are listening now even though this audience is pretty loyal although today they're that's so great

[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:30.360]
But you know there there are a lot of the time, but they're not just listening, you know, they're listening to their life

[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:35.440]
It's just a radio show so so it's not my life in like two sentences. So we recap yesterday

[00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:39.740]
You can do 10 sentences. I don't care. We got 29 minutes ago

[00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:45.920]
We told her he's got a great guest today by the way Ernie's got um who is that guy?

[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:48.980]
Fred Altcocker

[00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:49.460]
Oh

[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:54.880]
Rolly old prunes out there and he's gonna pick on old people again today look out

[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:59.900]
He's gonna do a number on you. They're gonna send you back your metamusel from last week. They're gonna be so upset

[00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:02.940]
And you ought to see what's gonna be in it a

[00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:04.860]
Free sample

[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:11.220]
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm useful. Let's get serious. He did a show. He did five hours on

[00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:13.720]
I know being buried in metamusel or something

[00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:19.940]
You wanted to be packed in metamusel you should have seen we come in this morning and there's a mic stand

[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:22.540]
This big grotesque

[00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:28.220]
Like a like a crane, you know with a mic on the end like crane you know like you put on

[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:31.140]
No, that was just like you put on a filter fish crane

[00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:32.960]
Through the row of these scientific

[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.580]
They're like that hook on that into the table

[00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:39.360]
You notice how Rick Edwards put these four holes in the table and it was this big ugly

[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:43.620]
It's like really a lamp is it the same measure as he has no

[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:47.160]
Diamonds is like a lamp. Oh who put a who's putting on this yesterday?

[00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:52.360]
There's a big electronic microphone and maniac Rick Edwards the corporate chief engineer

[00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:57.300]
It's called job justification when he comes in the town. He's got to mess up something or they you know

[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.360]
They don't know what he's doing on the payroll. We've been wondering for a long time what he's doing on the payroll

[00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:04.340]
Is he still on the face?

[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:07.620]
Millions over in the panelist's part check the Saturday morning list

[00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:10.980]
They spend millions over in panelists park to improve the signal and somebody over there

[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:14.160]
I don't want to mention Bob's name told me that all the signal now goes into the bay

[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:18.840]
They're big in purpose in dolphins in Tampa Bayman or number one

[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:21.000]
They're number 16 in the market

[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:27.140]
Out of out of and the fish don't even listen on purpose. It's the only thing that they can pick up

[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:30.300]
Go ahead. I'm sorry. Now recapping yesterday

[00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:36.680]
We gave all the remember what all these people are waiting on hold for because the chances of my speaking to them slim and none

[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:09.080]
You're just a Yenta just a roving Yenta

[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:14.960]

Is that is that I like to say on me? Okay, they would call it a liar if they were referring to the president

[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.160]
But in your case we're trying to be nice

[00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:27.980]
Call it obfuscation. Why do you think people tell me all these things and I don't even know you're gonna repeat them?

[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:34.700]
I know it's just an accident so they just accidentally he just bumps into information

[00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:39.440]
He can't get out of the way of it quite a bit of turmoil and radio yesterday. Oh, yeah

Well, I know that well that wasn't my well that was I was I

We were starting all this we were getting all the

[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:11.620]
The gods of the rumors that we heard not from fruitcake at all did not come from

[00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:15.600]
Turning into a real you know he was right on a borderline. You know of really

[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:20.480]
Really were except we were about to accept him into our hearts in our minds and

[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.780]
Every time you're on the verge of doing that he just absolutely can't control himself

[00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:29.600]
I love to give him credit. I love to call it. Oh, it's Ken Blatt. You know that you know the

Need serious. I heard him on that with Dr. Meltzer the other night. Did you hear him?

He had a minute two fifty that

[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:38.560]
Meltzer going for about a half an hour and I don't think Meltzer ever realized

[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:41.420]
He was the most real fun like terminal cancer here

[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:50.060]
So yes picking up where you left off 20 minutes ago. We gave all the rumors yesterday

[00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:37.080]
With Rennery in the morning a two-person show and

[00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:45.120]
Rennery sugar cookie. Oh Michael Schuster. Henry hit the ceiling. Yeah, I imagine it's retin to quit

[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:52.220]
He must be having a nervous breakdown just having to do nine to ten again. Yeah, I'm threatened to quit if they put her on with him

[00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:55.800]
That's the latest. Yeah, so they're not

[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:27.280]
Financial just as he fills in he does financial news. He's got a just a terrible voice

[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:30.760]
No personality. He's pathetic. Perfect for I O D

[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:31.100]

Fruitcake called him up at home last week. Oh, this is a true story. No, he did yes

[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:47.840]
He did and he said you better be prepared Paul Lyle

Oh, I said you better be prepared to do two to six. They're gonna offer you the job

[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:53.780]
I handed this that's that part is true

[00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:58.220]
I know that for a fact and he can deny it from here till the end of time. I know it's true

[00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:02.000]
Because I was sitting there in Paul's house when the call came in

[00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:09.400]
And then from six till then they had the sports thing sports talker five

[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:16.220]

Even though I'll run tell her it's not all of me shows

[00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:14.900]
Then there's the foul

[00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:18.640]
Whose show gets worse by the hour

[00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:23.680]
It's hard to figure out which way I'll and we go

[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:23.800]

Boy, I'm telling you what a great science. Joseph Gackie. That could be I guarantee one thing

[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:13.880]
Joseph Gackie is prepared to pay serious money for that kid's home address

[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:18.200]
And I have a fruitcake is like the master control behind all of the AM stations

[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:27.120]
And his mind he is no question doing it. He knows he knows before the people in the show

[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:35.300]
Zagaki would pay serious money for that child's home address show. I got it too and Joe has all of that sports equipment

[00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:38.340]
You know like hockey sticks and baseball bats

There's no place in the world that has what we go up going on in Miami

[00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:05.300]
Three three English speaking for a spaniol

[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:07.400]

[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:47.860]
Mike Miller read W snooze. I have a feeling he may have talked to he may have talked to our call letters to W lose

[00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:53.440]
