[00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.220]
Partial number 82.

[00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.940]
We'll look for the pink flag.

[00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.020]
Give it to clearance.

[00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.260]
Let him drop it on the line.

[00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.780]
I do. And clearance has that

[00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.820]
country and western traffic this month.

[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.960]
We're need deep to our hip boots

[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.560]
in traffic today.

[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.500]
We're up to it.

[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.660]
They destroyed this show today.

[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.700]
They've done it to me again.

[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:24.500]
Can you believe it?

[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.820]
I think it calls for a lawsuit.

[00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:26.980]
I really do. I'm sitting here.

[00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.380]
I'm talking about it out loud

[00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.940]
because I think we ought to discuss this.

[00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.960]
But they continue interfering with my ability to go on the air

[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.660]
and just be myself, which is why for months now

[00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.900]
I've sounded so psychotic.

[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.240]
Because ordinarily I'm just

[00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.200]
half asleep all the time.

[00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.220]
But when you come in here,

[00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.320]
they mess with your brain.

[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.980]
They wake up and hear.

[00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.360]
They mong with your brain.

[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.720]
Yeah, this building away.

[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.240]
Snarl, snarl, snarl.

[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.820]
That was the most emotional thing Jeff has said

[00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.060]
in all the years he's been in the building.

[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.360]
Boy, is he a powerhouse, a dining hall?

[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.860]
A dining hall.

[00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.980]
One of the movers and shakers at W.I.N.Z.

[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.420]
A very few people in the country

[00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.640]
who can handle those CBS memos with the flair.

[00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.160]
Boy.

[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.500]
Moving right along.

[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.240]
Oh, I'm down, nine to go.

[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.440]
It's not like that.

[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.160]
You should have given one of that first broad

[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.860]
that called here.

[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.060]
Why? Just a bother.

[00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.720]
First bag.

[00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.320]
Yeah.

[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.340]
Are you gay?

[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.480]
I heard it at Y-100.

[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.400]
I can't believe they're talking about that

[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.320]
on Y-100.

[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.840]
Why not?

[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.380]
They don't let that else talk about, I guess.

[00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.100]
They just want to get the island queen

[00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.980]
listening over there.

[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.020]
Oh, I see.

[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.460]
Well, that'll do it.

[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.800]
Maybe they'll have to bring one of their former

[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.900]
mourning people back.

[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.840]
Well, we don't want to get into that.

[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.980]
But their rumors about that.

[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.780]
Yeah.

[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.960]
But to get that crowd again.

[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:54.840]
Where's the poster?

[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.960]
The mail came speaking of the island queen.

[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.180]
That's right.

[00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.380]
Where is my wall size Jeff Striker poster

[00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.960]
which didn't show up again today?

[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.000]

[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.480]
And there'll be no more mail till Monday.

[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.060]
That's all right.

[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.960]
Brian's working tonight at the ice cream place.

[00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.380]
He is.

[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.280]
Okay.

[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.720]
Now we go to.

[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.920]
Yeah.

[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.940]
That's the one.

[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.440]
Dave County.

[00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.720]
Hello.

[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.440]
Hey, good morning, Uncle Neil.

[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.020]
How you doing?

[00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.560]
All right.

[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.080]
Okay.

[00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.440]
Uncle Neil, did you read the front page of the hurl?

[00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.220]
Never looked at it, sir.

[00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.720]
Well, a big new story today has to do with Jeff Striker.

[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.540]
What?

[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:29.820]
I'm not kidding you.

[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.500]
You open up the front page.

[00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.860]
Okay.

[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.360]
And you know the new movie The Switch is on.

[00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.900]
Well, the FCC has approved the film.

[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.560]
That was Channel 4 is going to be selling it.

[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.620]
Yeah.

[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.180]
They go up.

[00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.080]
Well, you see what popped into his head when he read it.

[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.560]
So this is one of the problems of listening to this show.

[00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:51.940]
I know in my mind.

[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.120]
I don't know where it's heading, but it'll do it to you.

[00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.520]
It's definitely going down.

[00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:57.400]
Yeah.

[00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.680]
Yeah.

[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:05.200]
If you also got a page 15a, there has been a lawsuit concerning

[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.800]
sleeve bag to use the word.

[00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.320]
Yeah, we saw it.

[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.860]
Oh, that.

[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.760]
Yep.

[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.060]
I like the term is too slippery to be a fact.

[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.020]
One can grasp.

[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.560]
Yeah.

[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.120]
And hold up to the lamp at the truth.

[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.660]
So it's legal to cost them what a sleeve bag.

[00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:20.320]
That's right.

[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.380]
Like sunny fox.

[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.840]
You're a sleeve bag, sunny.

[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.540]
Now that's legal and a slime ball.

[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.260]
And a banana mouth.

[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.760]
I hear a douche bag is up in the next case.

[00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.500]
Yeah.

[00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.300]
We'll get a ruling on that now.

[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.940]
Yeah, it was Palm Beach Circuit Court.

[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.740]
Well, listen, you've killed enough time for now.

[00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.280]
I guess you want one of these albums, right?

[00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.900]
Yeah.

[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.520]
Thank you.

[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.960]
I'm sure of that.

[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.700]
Mojo Nixon and Skidropper, who are probably the epitome of this

[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.520]
entire program.

[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.700]
Right.

[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.060]
Okay, here, here you go.

[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.060]
Just pick up the old phone there and to do another 30 seconds worth of very hard work.

[00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.500]
Look at him.

[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.520]
Boy, just got that pen poised.

[00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.960]
Now, last night.

[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.020]
We aren't asking the ages of the callers today.

[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.360]
Are we?

[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.620]
No, let's not do it.

[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.860]
Let's not push our lights.

[00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.760]
That was two days ago.

[00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:07.200]
We had all those.

[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.120]
We had Wednesday, the perfect demographics.

[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.080]
Okay.

[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.580]
And all the callers sounded like they had Nike.

[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.120]
Like, the unit, of course, was until yesterday when Kyle was very nasty to the callers.

[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.920]
And that kind of changed the entire call on X.

[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.600]
Although yesterday, we only, what do we have?

[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.040]
We did Tom Jipi yesterday.

[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.420]
How could there have been a crisis with Jica?

[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.580]
Well, it was his crisis, with his office, one with the station.

[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.660]
I'm not talking about that one.

[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.560]
I'm talking about the one upstairs with the phone.

[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.220]
Oh, yeah.

[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.760]

[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.340]
Yeah.

[00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.320]
That happened, yep.

[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.960]
Pretty unlikely.

[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.120]
The only crisis is when the transmitter opened up to the Red Sea.

[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.640]
Kyle went back there and stuck his finger in it and saved it from drowning in the, the, the equity gets.

[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.940]
A real zet's, a stuch in the back.

[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.640]
From our psychotic engineering and programming departments.

[00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.620]
No, you can't, you can't do that.

[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:00.360]
You can't do that.

[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.380]
You can't do that.

[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.560]
We don't talk to these people about it.

[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.020]
You can't do that.

[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.220]
You'll be, you'll be, you'll be.

[00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.000]
Can't they leave us alone?

[00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:17.060]
Should we, should we have some kind of an endurance contest to see just how many days they could go and just leave us alone?

[00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:18.080]
Not interfere.

[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:24.860]
No memos, no messages, no hostility, no snarl, snarl, snarl, no nothing.

[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.220]
How long do you think they could do that?

[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.840]
I'd like to see.

[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:29.300]
Am I an hour?

[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.080]
Shame on you.

[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.000]
Wash your brains out with chlorox.

[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:45.220]
26 till noon at WINZ and, but you know what, what it's going to come down to if Gary ever does come back because he's off to New York again today.

[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.180]
Boy, I'll tell you.

[00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.600]
I'll tell you.

[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.480]
He's, I'll come.

[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.360]
He has been in here the last few weeks.

[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.260]
Very little.

[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.300]
Have you noticed that?

[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.340]
About three days.

[00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.660]
Right.

[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.300]
And then some of the days, not the whole day.

[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.880]
I know.

[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.700]
And we seem to be, you know, surviving and rolling along.

[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.580]
Well, he said this morning was going on strike.

[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.620]
Him in here and he's going on strike.

[00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:18.100]
But if he shows up, if he shows up, we are going to tell him we, yes, we, we don't do the show unless Kyle answers the phone.

[00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.740]
I agree.

[00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.260]
Yeah.

[00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:20.340]
I agree with that.

[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.000]
It's as simple as that.

[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.440]
I support that 100%.

[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:23.920]
Absolutely.

[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.140]
We're on the record right here.

[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.900]
And if they want to bring somebody, some other, they want to bring Herman and McBean's in here and do the show.

[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:29.860]
No problem.

[00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.160]
No problem.

[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.540]
We'll go out, you know, as long as the paycheck keeps coming every other Friday.

[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:34.900]
Right.

[00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.960]
No problem.

[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.460]
They can bring Ali and Ingles in here.

[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.260]
With the two.

[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.700]
You can book a lot of guests.

[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.780]
We're going to Jewish singles and productions the first day.

[00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:47.900]
With Pauline.

[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:49.300]
Yeah.

[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.380]
That would get about a one.

[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.080]
No.

[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.400]
Not even close.

[00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:57.920]
Hello, Pauline.

[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.960]
24-year-old, no, in the WINZ, we're going to take another commercial break.

[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.360]
We still have eight albums to go.

[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.120]
We might stretch that out till one o'clock.

[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.880]
Well, she'll have to beat Arlene Ross to the front of the line.

[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.520]
I'll tell you that.

[00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.700]
20-till Midnight at WINZ.

[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.800]
Arlene has a way of muskling the Kodna.

[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.240]
20-till Midnight.

[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:25.460]
Right.

[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:25.820]
Okay.

[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:26.500]
Just checking.

[00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:26.880]
Yeah.

[00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.760]
We're back doing the night show, which means in 20 minutes I can go home.

[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.080]
Bill Colder will be here.

[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:31.480]
Exactly.

[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.220]
Okay, let's go back.

[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:35.460]
Well, I'm confused today.

[00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:40.060]
I'm very confused because it hurt to have all of this stuff going on around us.

[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.740]
We had a winter in Broward and a winter.

[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:42.820]
Last one was days.

[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.700]
So probably time to go back to Broward and say it's a good time for...

[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:46.920]
Hello.

[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:47.560]
Hello.

[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:48.240]
How you doing?

[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:48.640]
Yeah.

[00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.420]
Well, I'm very sorry.

[00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:54.500]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.120]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:02.740]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:02.780]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:02.820]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:02.820]

[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:03.260]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:03.340]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:03.840]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.240]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:04.480]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.800]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:07.580]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.020]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.140]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:09.160]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:09.520]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:09.520]

[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:09.700]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:09.700]

[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.440]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:10.720]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:10.960]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:11.900]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:13.540]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:15.500]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.800]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.980]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.380]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:23.840]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.700]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:29.860]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.160]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.300]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:32.440]

[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:32.440]

[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:32.440]

[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:33.760]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:34.580]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.240]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.060]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:37.380]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:38.160]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:38.160]

[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:38.160]

[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:38.260]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:38.260]

[00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:38.260]

[00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:38.460]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:38.480]

[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:38.900]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:38.900]

[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:39.560]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:40.740]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:41.500]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.080]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.040]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:44.880]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:53.820]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.420]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:56.420]

[00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:56.440]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:58.620]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.020]
I'm sorry.

[00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:01.920]
I'm sorry.

[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.360]
I'm sorry.

[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.400]
I'm sorry.

[00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:05.460]
I'm sorry.

[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.340]
I'm sorry.

[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:06.580]
I'm sorry.

[00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:07.940]
I'm sorry.

[00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:09.040]
I'm sorry.

[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:09.520]
I'm sorry.

[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.080]
I'm sorry.

[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:10.340]
I'm sorry.

[00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:10.880]
I'm sorry.

[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:11.960]
I'm sorry.

[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:12.560]
I'm sorry.

[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:13.680]
I'm sorry.

[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.060]
I'm sorry.

[00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:15.820]
I'm sorry.

[00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:15.820]

[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.480]
I'm sorry.

[00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:17.840]
I'm sorry.

[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:17.920]
I'm sorry.

[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:18.400]
I'm sorry.

[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.280]
I'm sorry.

[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:23.800]
I'm sorry.

[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.260]
I'm sorry.

[00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:50.260]

[00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:50.260]

[00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:50.260]

[00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:51.140]
Probably a very stressed-calactic mood for a late night.

[00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:51.140]

[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:51.260]
let's.

[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:51.320]
Well let's slow the pace down a little bit.

[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:51.320]

[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:51.320]

[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:51.320]

[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:51.320]

[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:51.320]

[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.860]
Well let's slow the pace down a little bit.

[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:53.780]

[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:59.200]
motion. He worked. Yes, so yes, I was. So emotional. You know, since he saw that

[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:05.880]
voluptuous thing in the tobacco shop at the Broward Mall. Oh boy. He really he's not joking. He put his

[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:11.200]
head in his hand. I'm talking about the head on his shoulders. Okay. He put his head in his hands

[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.360]
and he just like kind of slumped down on the end of the counter. Thank goodness. This young lady was

[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.820]
she was like walking in the other direction. She oblivious. Yeah. Yeah. He was like on a way out.

[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:26.000]
And he just was sobbing and moaning like making guttural sounds on the end of the counter.

[00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:30.000]
And I said, that's why I got him out of there real quick. I was embarrassed. Thank God you were there.

[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:36.560]
Yeah. This is absolutely true. I know it is. Every word I say yesterday that he doesn't, I don't know

[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:41.340]
how close he came to asking me to just go on without him. He would have walked home

[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:48.440]
from from from the Broward Mall. Probably with a stop at Windixi on the way.

[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:54.780]
Well, what was I want to take you know what was all he had to do is say go ahead. I could

[00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.740]
it could have spent a few more minutes up there with Josh and my good friend. Right.

[00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:01.940]
But he Mack and Bolio. It wasn't about this girl. She was good. Okay. She was hot.

[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:09.180]
And she had scanty clothing. Very scantly. You know, one of those where the puppet is hanging out

[00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:15.200]
and done almost all of the body parts are just like, you know, she was not understanding.

[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.740]
Little old for stand though. She must have been about 20 or 20 20s.

[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:25.280]
Pretty old. I think pushing the outer limits. No kid. But she was good. Okay.

[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:31.680]
Brooks getting out of range now. Why is it that when Brook Shields was 14? It's okay if like a

[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.840]
50 year old guy would call one of these shows and the bar. I'd sure like to get to know that

[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:42.240]
Brook Shield. Oh, yeah, that would be okay. But for example, if you came on and said that you'd

[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:49.580]
like to get to know River Phoenix. It's our society. You know, it's just, no, it's our society.

[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:54.900]
I'm trying to answer it. So you like to get to know River Phoenix? No. No. Not my type. I would.

[00:11:55.180 --> 00:12:04.260]
Always not your type. Maybe we ought to explore that a little before we give away our next

[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:08.160]
album. I'd like to talk to River. He's a good actor. Yeah. He's a very good actor.

[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.880]
I'd like to have a little chance. Sure. Talk about his sister Rainbow. Yeah.

[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:19.940]
I love his parents. Yeah, his parents and their and their naming practices. I'd like to have

[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:24.440]
a little discussion with River about his parents. Yeah. He would raise a two-son and flagstank.

[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:29.340]
He would name their kids these names. I'd like to talk to the parents and ask them,

[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:36.360]
you know, what they're trying to do here. Rainbow and River River. That's sorry. River is

[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:40.800]
wide. The river is deep. Do you remember that? Marvin. Is that Marvin Gaye or something? No. Sorry.

[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:48.360]
I'm thinking of something else. Obviously. The river is wide. The river is deep.

[00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:56.880]
I'm thinking of something else. I can't. I can't. I can't place it in my head. The river is wide.

[00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:00.600]
The river is deep. Is an old, cursed one song? What a... I...

[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:11.820]
Marvin Gaye. No, I guess not. I guess it wasn't Motown. It's not in the rack. That records on the rack, is it?

[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.480]
Just relax. Okay.

[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:29.140]
When you want something in that rack, no, it's impossible. There's an abba. Play abba. We've got a lot

[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:34.960]
of abba. All the good stuff. Stan has erased so we could put abba on all the cards. If every record...

[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:40.560]
Okay. What did we do next? That was powered. Yes. So, dates next. Hello, Dave County. Speak to us.

[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:47.320]
Neil. Yes, sir. Incredible. Unbelievable. I have a bone to pick with Mr. Glenn there.

[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:52.980]
Oh, good. Perfect day for it. Glater. Remember the day you gave Bobby the football tickets?

[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:57.020]
Sure. I was the second caller. And Bobby never used them.

[00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:03.200]
Sir, I did the best I could. My heart was in the right place. This isn't the guy we give the U of M tickets to.

[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:09.900]
No, no. No. This guy called up right after Bobby. I was trying to be a good guy. Bobby had done a lot of

[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:15.140]
work for us. Mailed out a lot of bumper stickers and stuff like that. I can understand. He had a good...

[00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:21.240]
Hey, don't apologize anymore. No, not apologizing. But he had a good story. He had never been to a football game

[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:28.240]
live. And it would have been great if he could have gone. But he blew it. Yeah, he blew it and, uh, you know,

[00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:34.420]
we won't repeat that mistake again. Kyle, I'd like to apologize for all the other idiots that call in.

[00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:40.740]
That doesn't deserve the abuse. True. True. Okay, you want one of these albums?

[00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:43.600]
I would appreciate it. Okay, anything else on your mind?

[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:47.480]
No, that'll do it. And Neil, don't worry about the bureaucrats. They'll get off your back.

[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:54.480]
They will. Eventually. Eventually. He had one way or the other, right? Yeah, what's it do you call

[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.780]
him from? I'm calling on a day line, but I'm calling from Pompo-no Beach. Oh boy, this is two

[00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:04.240]
Pompo-no letters in a row. What is going on in Pompo-no today? It's a good day for the great taste.

[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.920]
Have you visited her friend Dr. Happer? I'll hopefully get there. No, and I don't plan on it either.

[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:15.100]
I hear he's all hard. Okay, pick him up and get him out of my life. Will you please?

[00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:19.720]
Trouble, but it's still new. I can't find Marvin Gaye. Can you believe that?

[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:23.620]
It was in the rack. It's gone.

[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:29.540]
I'm spelling. That's Stan, boy. What an organizer. Hi, it's beyond belief.

[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.600]
Okay, let's take another break. What have we done? Is this the fourth one only?

[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.100]
Yeah. Oh, we can stretch this till two o'clock easy. What a hurt Donald.

[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.900]
Oh, I bet you want to power him.

[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:44.020]
I'll chose then to make him do.

[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:49.640]
Okay, I guess it's the last line in the power we've taken. There might even be somebody there who's not.

[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:54.560]
It's a good time for that great taste. Well, I guess you just disqualified yourself, sir.

[00:15:54.800 --> 00:16:00.780]
Oh, no. Really? No. Did you listen to Stan show yesterday toward the end of what Spindell?

[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:09.400]
Spindell was on with Steve? Yeah. Oh, Stan. After Stan was rambling on about the girl in the Tinder box?

[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:15.220]
No. Spindell says he knows her. It'scribed the car she drives on, etc.

[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:22.740]
It's a good time for the great taste. Now he's disqualified. Yeah. Say, the lot of Spindell

[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:27.120]
knows her. How good can she be? I miss the opening of your show. What are you still upset about?

[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:31.500]
We don't want to rehash it. Just more hassle from the bureaucrats all over the building. They're all

[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:36.540]
upset because Kyle isn't as nice to the callers as they want them to be and he told somebody to stick

[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:41.060]
it up their ear and they're having a nervous breakdown again because they like to take little

[00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:46.660]
problems and magnify them into gigantic problems and write memos and they all like to coward near

[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:51.560]
the you know, near the water fountain with Rick Shaw and you know, and of course they always

[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:56.140]
agree with each other. You notice that bureaucrats always suck each other's rear, you know,

[00:16:56.140 --> 00:17:00.620]
and they all get together and it's like it's us against them. Us against them.

[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:05.480]
Sounds like the place I work with. I don't want to get emotional again, you know,

[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:11.720]
but it's us against them, the talent, those terrible, you know. We're calling sick tomorrow.

[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:15.260]
Yeah, that's a good idea. What are you doing tomorrow? You want to do the show tomorrow?

[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:21.280]
Sure, I'd like to. No, I don't mean you. Well, I had planned to take the day off.

[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:25.480]
Well, it's available. Keep it open. Yeah, I'm feeling too well. Now that breakfasted

[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:31.060]
just about put me into I've got such heartburn from that cramp. Have you eaten any of those

[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:35.860]
bagels that they got at Burger King? No way. Ever since I saw the bird dropping many burgers.

[00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:41.120]
Oh, yeah, well, a bird in his spare time. He put those together for Burger King.

[00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:50.160]
What happened to Joe Zagaki as far as the dolphin game? You know, what do you mean by that?

[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:55.000]
Well, he's not on the field no more. I can't rebuild. No, old smelly pits doesn't

[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.560]
want him in there. Well, I couldn't stand with no Trumpi Sunday. So I turned on

[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:05.180]
Trumpy old. Trumpi is truly obnoxious, isn't it? Yeah, he's a little biased, I think. Not only

[00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:11.420]
that, but he never shuts his damn mouth, man, he runs off at the mouth and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:16.300]
Anyway, boy, he is weaver and the new guy they got on the field had interrupted Rick.

[00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:21.220]
What is it? Isn't that Brian Robbie? No, it's another guy. It's a new guy. I know who the hell he is.

[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.720]
Anyway, Rick got a little upset because he was going to say the station ID.

[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:30.860]
He goes, well, I was going to say the station ID, but I'll have to do that after the break.

[00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:33.920]
So he gets a little obnoxious at times.

[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:34.340]
Yeah.

[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.520]
Well, Rick has just got a little ego, you know, just a tiny one.

[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.400]
I'm going to send him some of the size of Tubby Boots.

[00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.860]
Anyway, I'm doing the rest of the show.

[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:45.660]
You're going to send it to the woods.

[00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:46.360]
You don't want the album?

[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.040]
Yes, I do.

[00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:48.240]
I know you've got other colors.

[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.940]
Oh, we just wanted to hear what you were going to send Rick, whatever his name is.

[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:52.500]
Farah Coast.

[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.000]
Right.

[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.820]
He started to say you were going to send him something.

[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.160]
You're going to send him either to the...

[00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:57.580]
From so.

[00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:01.540]
You're going to send him either to the Ivory Coast or a bar of Ivory and Coast.

[00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:02.680]
That's one of the other.

[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:02.940]
Yeah.

[00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:03.660]
That's it.

[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:07.580]
I'm just going to end this like this and this is what a familiar talk host does.

[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:08.620]
Good to hear from you.

[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:11.260]
Okay.

[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.000]
Who could he be talking about?

[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:14.320]
Mobile.

[00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:15.520]
Okay.

[00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:16.460]
Okay.

[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.420]
Grab the phone there and cut the crap already.

[00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:19.780]
What's your name?

[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:20.240]
Boy.

[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:22.320]
Well, listen, we're almost at the end of the hour.

[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.300]
We gave away five albums, so that's a pretty heavy work in an hour.

[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:25.560]
Okay.

[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:26.140]
And your dress?

[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:27.580]
Pretty heavy stuff.

[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.340]
We were a little abusive to the first young lady, but she doesn't even know what the hell

[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:32.180]
the name of the show is.

[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.100]
So much less the callators.

[00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.880]
We are given away in case you joined us late.

[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:38.500]
Five or about ten copies.

[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:42.460]
We have five to go of Mojo Nixon and Skid Roper's new album.

[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:42.980]
It's a new album.

[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:43.780]
It's called Frenzy.

[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:44.960]
Oh, he'll like it.

[00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:45.660]
Yeah, trust me.

[00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:46.360]
Okay.

[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:50.160]
Which has got such great American hits as the amazing Bigfoot Diet.

[00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.940]
I wonder if they had a page on levied for the rights to that.

[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.560]
Stuff in Martha's muffin about Martha Quinn.

[00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:03.660]
I hate banks for Stan in a God of the Vita new version, not by the Aaron Butterbell.

[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:04.560]
It's a new version.

[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:09.200]
The river is wide and the river is big by Marvin Gaye.

[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:14.700]
And of course in the next hour we'll answer that musical question is Marvin Gaye.

[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:17.140]
Or was Marvin Gaye?

[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:17.360]

[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:19.840]
But you've already got that lady that called.

[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:20.200]
Yeah.

[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:20.800]
Exactly.

[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:22.520]
And does he work at Y100?

[00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:22.920]
Right.

[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.460]
And would Michael Jackson like to buy his body?

[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.560]
That would be terrible.

[00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:32.240]
Well, he hasn't been, how do I say it delicately?

[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:33.680]
He didn't die that long ago.

[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:34.260]
Right.

[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.500]
See, the elephant man died 1800 years helping.

[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:38.320]
Long ago.

[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.180]
John Merrick.

[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.220]
So he's like ripe right now.

[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.540]
Oh, Michael likes him when they're ripe.

[00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:49.440]
In fact, we understand that he's working on, I'm serious, he's working on an excavation

[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:56.560]
of Queen Victoria's body because he said that was the only queen that would satisfy Michael.

[00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:57.940]
But I don't believe that for a minute.

[00:20:58.840 --> 00:20:59.300]
So anyway.

[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:09.280]
Well, I didn't know that Victorian age, it was a whole different world.

[00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:10.580]
Yeah.

[00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:14.480]
I wonder if the members of his family are speaking to him because he left Jehovah's Witnesses,

[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.020]
which is like leaving the mafia.

[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.640]
You cannot leave once you're in, you're in for life.

[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:24.340]
And if you do leave, like you're family and all, they don't even talk to you.

[00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.380]
And when you're worth three billion, I have a feeling that they might make some concession.

[00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:27.700]
Yeah.

[00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.380]
I think that maybe could be.

[00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:32.260]
We'll find out for you next star when we have Michael on the show live.

[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.300]
Right now we have our own Michael.

[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:38.440]
Michael Wolf is here without Arlene and the audience is tickled at death about that.

[00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:46.520]
If you'd like to participate on today's program, you can call Neil on 6249400 in date or 5249400 in

[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:46.980]
Broward.

[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.260]
And now here again, Neil Rogers.

[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.400]
Have a wonderful lunch.

[00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:51.700]
Yeah.

[00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:53.340]
Have a great lunch, Mark.

[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:56.700]
Hey, baby.

[00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:58.800]
I'm feeling kind of hungry.

[00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:00.000]
What's the lunch?

[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.260]
I'm going to pick you up, Funkas.

[00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:04.220]
You go stay with me.

[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:05.660]
Very good magician.

[00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:06.900]
Yeah.

[00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:09.700]
I've right come and gone.

[00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:11.500]
Yeah.

[00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:14.920]
If you feel yourself.

[00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:19.340]
You play basketball.

[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:23.100]
Yeah.

[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:36.200]
It's Steve.

[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:36.940]
Wonderful.

[00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:39.460]
Steve, you're crazy.

[00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:40.920]
Yeah.

[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:41.600]

[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:47.760]
Well, Mark.

[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:50.380]
I think they're abusing us a little bit too much, don't you?

[00:22:51.980 --> 00:23:00.360]
Well Jeff, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know anything. Is that a rough

[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:05.400]
fact? Well, you know, you caught me and go out into the kitchen because you had all that

[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:09.340]
change and I got one of these sandwiches, one of these mong sandwiches out of our machine.

[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:15.540]
Mm-hmm. And it says, whoever heard of a sandwich named this, I mean I've heard of Ruben

[00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:25.940]
Sandwich, Royals Choice and in little print it says, fit for a queen. So why would you choose that one?

[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:31.200]
Well, it's sort of like betting on a horse. I didn't just want to disappoint Sonny Fox.

[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:37.780]
I didn't want to disappoint Sonny Fox. You had a horse name, Dyke. Because Sonny so upset about

[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:46.960]
those homosexuals, especially the ones he works with. Yeah, the brand of cards they send over

[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:52.300]
to this station. Yeah. Yeah. Just a typical card that you'd expect everybody to go out and get

[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:58.660]
as a greeting card. Keep them coming. Okay, we have five more albums to give away. We're under

[00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:03.140]
real derisht now because the bureaucrats are out to lunch together. I saw them hand in hand,

[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:08.580]
arm and arm with their suits on. Mm-hmm. With their three-piece Birx brothers suits. That ties. Wow.

[00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:13.580]
That was really impressed. This means we can do anything. You know, I even tucked my shirt in

[00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:18.420]
today because I was so impressed. Gary's in New York. Yeah. Bureau crats are out to lunch.

[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:22.680]
We can do anything. Are they out eating freebies probably? Oh, I'm a lunchola. Absolutely.

[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:26.520]
No, I think we can do anything. I think Tim Williams is still in his office. He wasn't speaking

[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:32.660]
to me. Give me a dirty look. But the boss's son, the owner's son is in his office.

[00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:37.280]
So we're in trouble still. Really? We got to mind our peas and cues.

[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:41.380]
Oh, boy. All right. Because he's not as fond of his show as he used to be. He's turned on me.

[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:46.480]
Really? I don't know, but I just, it sounded good. Well, that's what Lanciter would say, you know,

[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:53.040]
they all hate you. They hate you. And what he just understand, they all hate him.

[00:24:54.380 --> 00:25:00.000]
Because he's so morbid and depressing. By the way, speaking of Bob Lanciter.

[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:06.200]
Another rumor? No. And I cannot tell you any details, but I don't hear him at all. Is this my cough?

[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:13.720]
Is it not working? Is it working? Hello? Testing one, two, testing. This is a test.

[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:22.100]
For the next 60 hours, this station will conduct a test. Unfortunately, it's on the emergency Bureau crat system.

[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:30.040]
Is that what the, unfortunately, it is working? It's on. These are sturdy. These mics. Let me show you how sturdy they are.

[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:37.400]
Let me bang one against the side of the board a couple of times. I love the way that sounds on the air when you do that.

[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:42.820]
Does it sound good? Oh, great. These are electro voice mics. Do they sound good when you go?

[00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:48.520]
Oh, there's, there's, there's, there's, what do you get nervous about? Fix it. Maybe we can get some of the good mics

[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:54.560]
that are lying around on the floor upon EFM from your month, mung brain counterpart on FM engineering up there.

[00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:02.120]
Mr. Van Schnuck. Now that we asked much, yeah, what does he do for us?

[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:06.940]
We have a enjoyment, you know, just what we want is one noemon, like Leonard Noemon.

[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:12.080]
Now, what were you about to say before they shut your mic off? We have this sandwich is

[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:16.660]
mung city. And you notice I've started eating again this morning. I've been eating just

[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:22.200]
one like a burger king. I didn't need this. They got me wound up like an alarm clock now. The

[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:27.420]
eating since you've been in the building. About 85 memos all running around. If you ever do this again,

[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:35.460]
about not to me, to Kyle, they got nasty memos. How can you take that big paycheck and have a clear

[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:44.480]
conscience? Richard had to go on welfare just to give you that 40-cent a week raise.

[00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:50.100]
It's true. He had a drown one of his children.

[00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:06.640]
Just to pay Kyle. And now Kyle turns on him and calls some miserable nasty old fart,

[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:16.720]
a miserable nasty old fart. Shame on you. I think Kyle thought he was just stating facts when

[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:21.400]
he was talking to that person. Yeah. We do need Jack Webb just to fact just the facts.

[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:30.780]
This sandwich boy, a friend of this show in the business. We still have one. Yeah, we have a

[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:34.860]
couple not in the building. No, no, no. You notice they're out of the building. It's another

[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:40.920]
all hostile now even inside the building. Like Rasta used to bring us the mail because we don't

[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:46.020]
get any mail anymore. But that's only since I came back from vacation after you blew away the

[00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:50.960]
audience. I used to get cartons. Remember that carton is full of mail every day. Now we're lucky if

[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:59.540]
we get three pieces of mail. And two of them are from like public service, you know. Or this kind of

[00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:03.720]
kind of doctor that went through the show. He's booked himself on the show. Must have been talking

[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:08.320]
to Leanne. He booked himself on the show. No, but he's he would love to come on the show. Well,

[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:13.780]
if you'd like to be a guest on the show, call Leanne Engel at the State of Florida on Employment

[00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:21.020]
Office. Yeah. That's where you can find her. Boy, if I got a heartburn now. A friend of the show

[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:30.120]
at another radio station knows someone who works at WFLA. And there this is the Bob Lasseter story.

[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:36.380]
Yeah. They're going to work on getting us some outtakes from production and stuff. Oh, I can't

[00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:41.320]
wait. Yeah. And we don't want to tip our hands. But you know, Bob has his spies listening who will

[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:45.540]
immediately call. Yeah, he'll know this within 10 seconds. Yeah. So I give no details. But

[00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:54.560]
we're working on that syrup. Ticiously. Is that the right word? No. It's the word I picked up from.

[00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:57.380]
Then I'll get home and there'll be a message from Lasseter on my phone.

[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:08.940]
Hey, bud. Yeah. That is Bob. It's Bob. He always calls you, bud. I'd recognize that

[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:14.960]
you're not going to be pressing voice anywhere. And stay away from Dave Murray while you're over there too.

[00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:19.340]
Are you not at the same state anymore? But he keeps hanging around city. Yeah. Look out.

[00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:24.580]
The album will be up to number six. That's right. We only got five to go. Am I right?

[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:31.440]
Yes, you are. It's trying to see what Caldys we gave the last discussion. You sitting here with a

[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:35.800]
worm dangling from his beat. Oh, the last county was powered. Howard said that means we go back to

[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:42.040]
the PC case and come on the show and do a little countdown. Number six this week. Hello, please,

[00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:46.820]
which you do so well. Name of interest. Yeah. All you foreigners at Miami Day, by the way,

[00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:49.680]
bug off. You know what I'm saying? What do you know about American radio?

[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:56.980]
Radio free Argentina. Maybe they remember from that great, from Eva Perone, I think. Miami.

[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:03.580]
Are you getting these writers? You just making these up? Okay. Thanks. See, what he does is he makes up

[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:07.960]
all the names and dresses, puts them on his sheet. He takes all the albums home. It's also. And then we

[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:13.760]
stuck it in all these calls. Hey, never got my album. Never got my jacket. Probably opening up a

[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:21.340]
Neil Rogers trinket store, a memorabilia store on Clothel. And that day comes when you need something

[00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:27.540]
to fall back on like in October 2018 at WINZ. We're going to take another commercial break. We still

[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:35.220]
have what four to go. Right. Boy, are we milking this or what? Not my type. Not anybody's type.

[00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:41.020]
That stands problem. Come on. Do do do do do. Come on. Okay. Later. Mobile.

[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:49.500]
Oh.

[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:56.140]
Most of it's choked up. Right. He gets it five minutes.

[00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:01.920]
Act to believe the. Oh, wait a minute. Now, I must do even though I'm not going to do the show.

[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:08.440]
I was going to do today because the bureaucrats here got us all really upset. P.O.D.S. and B.M.

[00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:14.900]
But other than that, I do have to mention because I started to mention it yesterday when Jiko was here.

[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:20.100]
Tom Tom Jitka. Yeah. As some idiot, I know what to say. Tom Jiga.

[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:28.040]
Tom. Don't you have any shame at all? I mean, is there is there nothing that anyone could say or

[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:32.520]
that you could do that would demean you, make you look in the mirror and think, oh, blub, blub, blub,

[00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:39.340]
like that. Nothing. Why would I be here if there was? True. Why would you be doing what you do if

[00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:47.040]
there was? Exactly. Anyway, Jiko is here yesterday and I didn't have time to get into it at length,

[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:53.500]
but I want to make a special announcement to all the morons who work at the salad scene in the

[00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:57.580]
Broward Mall. You know where the patio is and right on the corner is the place where they sell

[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:03.500]
juices and fruit, pardon the expression and salad and all that stuff. You couldn't get weighted on

[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:08.640]
there if your life depended on it. Okay? You couldn't get weighted on there if you were starving to

[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:14.140]
death. And I've had this happen so many times. What have we done to deserve this great honor?

[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:22.800]
Put away the birch. Will you please, Dave? What has he got here?

[00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:32.460]
Uh-oh. This is from Dave Caprito on the FM. If it's as good as what he brought us yesterday,

[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:38.280]
or get it, you know what I mean? Hey, we're killing him in the birch, man. We got

[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:45.460]
bad numbers and I love that Tom Birchman. He picks him out of a hat. He just picks the numbers out

[00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:51.040]
of a hat. Now, for nature lovers everywhere, it's the collection you've been waiting for,

[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:56.240]
the National Audubon Society presents the sounds of the bird. Yes,

[00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:01.960]
fill your home with a wide variety of species that will charm you and your friends. Enjoy such gems

[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:15.080]
and culture. Well, he redeemed himself. Yes, he did. He did it. That was good. That's a

[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:19.200]
hysterical. Yeah. And all true. Uh, we're all at the
