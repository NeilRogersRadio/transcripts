[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]
Rogers guy

[00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.240]
Holy

[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000]
I don't know why I came here tonight I

[00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.000]
Got the feeling that something around

[00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.320]
Put on a armor curtain don't take it off

[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.140]
You can see your rap I say my little song

[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.920]
Must to the left of me

[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.160]
Puzzles to the right here I am stuck in a temple with you

[00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.980]
You feel

[00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.000]
I'm stuck in a temple with you

[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.300]
And I'm wondering what it is I should do

[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.180]
I don't want to pray at the way that I want

[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.520]
And I know that I don't like my football

[00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.860]
Smokes to the left of me

[00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.380]
Puzzles to the right here I am stuck in a temple with you

[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.780]
Well you're in your daddy's business

[00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.200]
But you claim that you're with self-made man

[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.320]
Then your uncle's father comes over

[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.520]
Ask your poor, a bagel and crew

[00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:23.010]
And crew

[00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.450]
And crew

[00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.610]
Okay let's start out with a great call QAM

[00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.890]
Hello? Yes?

[00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.770]
Yeah I was just trying to call in the final

[00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.730]
The money ready gone is what the money what money?

[00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.450]
I would show that you are loving today

[00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.570]
The show that we're having on the money

[00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.570]
Yeah for the bomb what you calling?

[00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.470]
Bomb your ass bomb a rack yeah the bomb a rack

[00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.690]
Yeah I wish you want how much you want the bomb a rack

[00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.670]
How much cash you want for million

[00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.390]
Yeah I don't know how much I'll give it to you

[00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.730]
How about how about 50 cents?

[00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.950]
How about 50 cents?

[00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.750]
How about 30 cents?

[00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.670]
I have to leave it a little bit more than that

[00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.490]
Okay well listen we'll see if we can raise it for you

[00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.470]
10 or 5 or 5 or 6 or no crossover with a Humper today

[00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.190]
Because he's got bigger fish to fry than me

[00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.930]
I'll tell you that so must be an awful big fish

[00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.610]
Maybe it's a trout or a sturgeon

[00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.750]
Or a big sturgeon could be

[00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.870]
Maybe a sturgeon from Sturgis, Michigan

[00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.810]
I lived there you don't want to be living there

[00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.130]
Although they had this great, not a great restaurant

[00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.610]
It was a restaurant side of a hotel

[00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.030]
Before they had the best New England clam chowda

[00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.530]
Other than New England, man it was good

[00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.990]
Used to make that my whole lunch man go there and get a

[00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.810]
And they give you like a big bowl you can almost take a bath in it

[00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.730]
Look at the way these cones are smoking man

[00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.130]
Alster Coway's dead the war is over everything's okay

[00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.190]
Everybody's coming home not

[00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.330]
In fact 12 people were killed and 20 others wounded

[00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.730]
In a roadside bombing at a crowded market in San Pistons bagged ad

[00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.590]
Jadid neighborhood according to an official with bagged ad for the least today

[00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.350]
A second roadside bomb 30 minutes earlier

[00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.410]
Lot of men say they've hood targeted in Iraqi police patrol

[00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.170]
Two civilians were killed there and eight police wounded in the incident

[00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.230]
These attacks came on the same day as US and the networks are hyperventilating

[00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.790]
And there's your fearless leader into putting him out of business

[00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.670]
He put him out of business man he gave him what four Alzar Coway

[00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.410]
We'll see him no more they got pictures of him with his eyes closed

[00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.070]
So he's either dead or maybe he's taken a nap

[00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.890]
He's dead

[00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.330]
US and Iraqi authorities announced that terrorist leader Abou Musab Alzar Coway

[00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.930]
The most wanted man in Iraq was killed in a coalition air strike

[00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.090]
Al-Rai! Al-Rai!

[00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.870]
So how is Osama doing?

[00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.830]
We got him yet?

[00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.250]
And how about Mollabala Omar?

[00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.890]
No

[00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.110]
No, don't got them yet

[00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.270]
We got the Sodom locked up, of course he didn't have nothing to do with any of this

[00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.950]
But nevertheless

[00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.010]
In fact when he was in there there wasn't all these terrorists running around killing all these innocent people

[00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.790]
Plus our soldiers

[00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.610]
But nevertheless don't start peeing on their parade man

[00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.870]
They are just emotionally wound up like an alarm clock

[00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:07.870]
The parade is very terrible

[00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:08.770]
There's gonna be a parade

[00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.650]
They're doing an apple crisp there

[00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.630]
Already TV and air all over the world

[00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.270]
At least bush and glare anyway

[00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.630]
Oh look at that

[00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.990]
Olga Morera

[00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.010]
How am I gonna read this?

[00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.670]
The prettiest tiny thing in my life

[00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:21.290]
Like a scotty

[00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.830]
Tried to thwart the devil Olga did but death cut up further anyway

[00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:25.490]
Oh no

[00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.190]
Morera 77, debout Catholic from the Jamaica section of Queens

[00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.290]
Purfosely chose to go from

[00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.890]
Go home from Fitzburg for a doctor's appointment today before June 6th to avoid traveling on the dreaded day of the devil

[00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:37.930]
666 yesterday

[00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.310]
She had a fear of what might happen on 666

[00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.750]
She was a very religious Catholic woman

[00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.330]
She had a feeling that something was gonna go wrong

[00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.170]
She must have left her rosary beads behind

[00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.210]
Maybe that's it

[00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.150]
Oh that's what a granddaughter said

[00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.550]
And Nira Ledema of Fitzburg

[00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.290]
This print is tiny and also

[00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:55.630]
But anyway

[00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.050]
Morera however died before she could brave the very day that she feared

[00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.850]
How do you like that?

[00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.590]
About 314 money after noon

[00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.730]
The express van Morera had booked for her trip home

[00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.390]
Gave way from its park position

[00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.990]
Started to roll down the street and struck a park car

[00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.530]
Two passengers including Morera were ejected through the open van door

[00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:13.990]
I thought she was a good Catholic

[00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.130]
Lord wouldn't do that to her

[00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.490]
No

[00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.570]
Morera suffered to her head travel when her head hit the ground and later she died

[00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.730]
Have you mass medical center in Worcester?

[00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.650]
Ramon Herbees, who runs the Worcester based New York City Express van

[00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.410]
Service didn't return to call Seagun Commett

[00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.090]
She was 77 and she wasn't sick not taking medication

[00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.850]
Nothing was wrong with her Ledema said

[00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:32.990]
Maybe she suffered from a demon

[00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.750]
Morera a seamstress who moved to New York from Ecuador

[00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.790]
A seamstress 32 years ago from Ecuador

[00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.490]
She will be buried this Saturday in Fitzburg where her son Antonio lives

[00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.570]
For other two children, Yolanda and Gato Freddie

[00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:45.570]
What does that say?

[00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:46.550]
I can't read it

[00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:47.170]
Is that what it says?

[00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.730]
Galo Freddie may not be able to attend a funeral service because they can't afford to travel from Ecuador

[00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.390]
Wow what the hell is it to make? She won't care

[00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:55.350]
She didn't want to travel on that specific date

[00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.250]
She wanted to feel safe at home said LaDema

[00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.190]
We felt that was the safest way to get her back

[00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.150]
Well they got her back but you know in a box

[00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.750]
I think that's exactly what they had in mind or maybe this is what they had in mind

[00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.450]
Pretty gril and pretty grotesque host to show you

[00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.650]
You can't start to strategize and start thinking too much it's a bad idea

[00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.150]
I think it's worth it that crossover thing with the Humphor is starting to get the little iffy

[00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.010]
You know are we just dumping that now or what?

[00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.490]
We just, especially with the summer schedule coming up

[00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.870]
I think that'd be a good idea to just stuff that all together

[00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.550]
Oh I'm sorry I was listening to a song in Cuba

[00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:25.030]
WK

[00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:28.070]
QAM hello

[00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:29.590]
Who's ready for him?

[00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:32.630]
WKWAM hello

[00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:33.890]

[00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.230]
Yeah okay got it WKWAM hello

[00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.430]
Hey how you doing?

[00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:38.230]
Alright

[00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:42.370]
Man I just called the earlier Metro PCF hang up on me

[00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.530]
I was fine to see if I win anything

[00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.050]
Or if I could win anything

[00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:48.810]
Yeah no no the answer is no

[00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.370]
WKWAM hello he's gonna be calling on there

[00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:52.150]
That's okay

[00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.750]
Turn that off pal yes

[00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.610]
Yeah it's about to be the free case religious people

[00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.030]
I write a motorbike where he's going out in the full dangerous

[00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:03.690]
You get hurt and last week of the week of the show I'm out in this guy I ride with

[00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.610]
You made the sign the cross before he went out

[00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.050]
Oh my god Jesus you know he's a good guy and we got a car

[00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.990]
Jesus is right that's you should have said that a few times

[00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.050]
Oh Jesus can't hurt

[00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:12.850]
So he went out and he comes back

[00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:14.870]
And he's the only one that ate his wife's gotten wrecked

[00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.490]
And the reason the cross

[00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:17.950]
Oh that's because Jesus was pissed off

[00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:19.350]
He don't go for that motor sport car

[00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.890]
And if I see you out there I'll go out on a kicker ass

[00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.070]
I heard you had motorcrosser

[00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:25.590]
Okay get him for Jesus man

[00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.530]
And kick his ass for Jesus and go away already

[00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:30.330]
Here's the poll we have for me yesterday

[00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.030]
Who's your favorite dead singer?

[00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.030]
Oh this could take us right up till midnight

[00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.350]
Let's take a look at that schedule first

[00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:36.170]
What day is it Thursday?

[00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.250]
We got jelly at the NBA final

[00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.090]
In Dallas real less

[00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:41.610]
I beg your pardon only Thursday?

[00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.130]
Yeah damn it seems like Sunday already

[00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.670]
Mad Dog 4-7

[00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:47.810]
We have no Marlon Salvatges to game out of that

[00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.130]
Series South have actually Josh is pretty impressed by that

[00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:51.790]
I bet you very bonds didn't know home run

[00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.110]
I actually don't know I didn't get to see the game

[00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:56.550]
Well they Marlon's beat me to one

[00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:58.030]
I know that I saw that

[00:07:58.030 --> 00:07:59.350]
Well I'm just telling you that I don't know

[00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:00.470]
They could have been there only one

[00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:05.510]
One more tally than Edmonton got against Carolina last night

[00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:06.270]
One more tally

[00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:06.710]
Nothing

[00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:08.510]
Oh dude I didn't see that

[00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:10.410]
I was busy getting my money back from my machine

[00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:11.950]

Although I do want to take 40,000 calls today

[00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:07.510]
We've got to get a lot of calls

[00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:09.130]
Illegal immigration 48

[00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:10.550]
I hate this poll only 19

[00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:11.190]
They like it

[00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:12.110]
Well kind of

[00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:13.470]
Game marriage only 9

[00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:14.510]
1.7%

[00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:16.530]
And flag burning only 3

[00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:17.750]
Half a 1%

[00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:19.050]
That's going to be their next deal now

[00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:20.290]
These far-bison right wingers

[00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:22.250]
Bring in all like they call them the wedges

[00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:23.490]
You know they're wedging it

[00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:24.330]
They're hedging it

[00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:24.870]
They're wedging it

[00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:27.310]
And now they're going to be all over this Al Zarqawi thing

[00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:28.810]
Like stink on Norma

[00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:29.830]
It's going to be unbelievable

[00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:31.350]
Speaking of Norma

[00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:33.610]
Cuba breaks taboos with National gay soap opera

[00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:34.350]
Do you see this story?

[00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:34.950]
Nope

[00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:36.010]
Well, you will

[00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:36.750]
You'll hear it now

[00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:38.510]
Notice up the date on the Cuban news as you are

[00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:39.550]
Well you better get with it

[00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:40.550]
Talk to Miguel Avada

[00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:41.890]
He knows about his gay Cubans

[00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:44.450]
Once persecuted then excluded

[00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:45.530]
And finally tolerated

[00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:47.830]
Cuban homosexuals have seen the delicate

[00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:48.630]
What is that?

[00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:49.390]
Oh the debate

[00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:49.990]
Open a lot

[00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.570]
I can't read this

[00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:51.230]
I wrote it myself

[00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:52.470]
Because it chopped off on the edge

[00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:55.710]
And they've seen the debate open wide before the rise over the past few weeks

[00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:56.410]
Open wide

[00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:01.190]
Now stay run Cuban television is breaking even more taboos with a gay soap opera

[00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:01.730]
How do you like that?

[00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:02.790]
Oh my god

[00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:07.810]
So the first time ever Cuban television is running a soap opera where several of the characters openly

[00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:08.210]
Gay

[00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:09.830]
The hidden side of the moon

[00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:11.030]
Is the title

[00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:12.950]
Oh you're bad

[00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:15.890]
Always think something intriguing is something really

[00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:16.350]
Yeah

[00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:17.730]
Rusem and Grotesque

[00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:18.890]
I wonder what kind of moon that is

[00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:19.550]
Talk to the world

[00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:20.030]
Oh no

[00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:25.070]
The hidden side of the moon is the title of the soap opera that's generated so much controversy among Cuban viewers

[00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:28.990]
That the institute of radio and TVA state run entity had to preempt regular program

[00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:31.810]
And invite a panel of experts to call for tolerance

[00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:33.750]
Come those bastards down

[00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:36.250]
Madi con madi con buka rawm baba ba ba ba

[00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:37.410]
We just like being in them

[00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:38.570]
Well, a sweet water again

[00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:42.230]
The soap opera tells the story of people that by different means have been infected by HIV

[00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:47.250]
Not everyone agrees with the notion that the soap will help Cuban society be more aware of diversity and become more tolerant

[00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:48.750]
Well, anything would be an improvement

[00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.050]
Abraham Bueno

[00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:53.170]
A gay who regularly turns into a female character named Imperial

[00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:54.150]
Or there we go again

[00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:55.710]
All the drag queens all the time

[00:15:56.290 --> 00:16:00.750]
I believe that while the new soap opera did give entry to homo's on homosexuals on television,

[00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:02.550]
it didn't necessarily help their image.

[00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:04.450]
Well, I'm sure that he's doing lots of doing it.

[00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:06.370]
That's by dressing up in drag all the time.

[00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:08.430]
All the drag queens all the time.

[00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:09.350]
You're fair, old brother.

[00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:12.210]
Madi-Kol and Madi-Kol and Boo-Yadon, etc. and so on.

[00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:13.250]
Yeah, what do you think about?

[00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:14.150]
Let's take a vote now.

[00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:15.710]
I say let's get rid of it.

[00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:19.090]
It's just going to be kind of ridiculous now, you know?

[00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:22.550]
Allo, it does fit in with the rest of the programming on this radio station.

[00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:24.190]
It kind of like in fits and starts, you know?

[00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:26.470]
Sometimes we do and sometimes we don't.

[00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:28.550]
Sometimes he'll do it and a lot of times he won't.

[00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:30.170]
I just tired of it, you know?

[00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:31.130]
Let's start at 10.

[00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:33.390]
We went through all that business with a stern thing, you know?

[00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.470]
When we were starting whatever the hell he felt like finally giving it up and going home.

[00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:38.010]
And I think we started at 10.

[00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:39.170]
Enough with that crap.

[00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:40.110]
Okay?

[00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.670]
Okay.

[00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:45.370]
Well, no, because you know, I'm not going to repeat what you said before the show.

[00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:47.390]
I'm not going to repeat what you said before the show either.

[00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:48.230]
I'm going to go ahead.

[00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:49.010]
I really go.

[00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:49.990]
I see one thing about me.

[00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:52.450]
I'll say it on the air and off the air as opposed to you.

[00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:54.390]
Or always like, you know, pussy-footing around.

[00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:54.810]
That's right.

[00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:56.390]
You make it up.

[00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:56.930]
Yeah.

[00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:57.510]
Oh yeah, I know.

[00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:00.870]
Just like all that crap about destroying our studio all the time.

[00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:01.850]
We just trouble making it all.

[00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:02.370]
Oh yeah, I understand.

[00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:03.830]
As parents, I'll tell you.

[00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:04.250]
That's right.

[00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:05.630]
You just make that stuff up.

[00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:09.270]
You know, this meeting that's going to take place tomorrow with Norma Kent and the

[00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:12.510]
two of the trauma with their Clarence Deereau and Joe Bell.

[00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:14.850]
I'd like to be a fly on the wall on that.

[00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:17.330]
Because they talk about the blind leading the blind.

[00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:18.170]
I'm only the three of them.

[00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:21.370]
They haven't got any idea what this is showing us all about, what our issues are.

[00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:22.530]
And they have it a big meeting.

[00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:26.250]
They're going to have a, and yesterday the house passed that in Dezancy Bill.

[00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:28.650]
So now it's, you know, they'll get the final thing all ironed out.

[00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:32.170]
And it'll go to Bushnell sign it so fast that your eyes won't be able to blink.

[00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:36.510]
And so now, if you think we were under tremendous pressure before, just wait.

[00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:38.970]
You ain't seen nothing yet, boys and girls.

[00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:39.630]
You just wait.

[00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:42.610]
It is going to be so clean and pristine and mean.

[00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:44.090]
It's going to be beyond belief.

[00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:47.330]
We won't, not only won't be able to play fart sounds on you.

[00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:49.190]
We won't even be able to fart in our personal lives.

[00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:49.670]
You think we're out.

[00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:49.970]
We're done.

[00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:51.410]
I think they're putting in the contract.

[00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:53.450]
That's part of the insubordination clause.

[00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:54.990]
If you fart, you're out.

[00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:56.870]
WQIM, hello.

[00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:58.910]
It's coming back.

[00:17:59.230 --> 00:17:59.230]

[00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:00.390]
WQIM, hello.

[00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:03.730]
It puts Albert, how are you in the bath?

[00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.310]
Yes.

[00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:05.350]
WQIM, hello.

[00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:07.910]
Okay, those are our three calls for that segment.

[00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:09.790]
I tell you, we're going to take a lot of calls today.

[00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:12.050]
If you got them, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:15.370]
See, when they least expected, you put the pressure on them and they can't come through.

[00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:18.130]
It's always been this way, although it never quite this way, you know?

[00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:19.610]
No, never quite this way.

[00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:25.410]
Like it is on this radio station.

[00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:27.590]
I've been doing this a long, long time.

[00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:31.430]
It's never quite, but this is the Q&F in a way where we are getting here.

[00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:34.430]
Oh, man.

[00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:36.330]
I just got the ass end of this studio, you know?

[00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:37.410]
Yes, go on, though.

[00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:42.130]
There's Tony Snow on there with his little swastik on his arm band, doing his Deutschland

[00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:42.910]
uberalus thing.

[00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:43.990]
Alzura Coway's dead.

[00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:44.890]
That's Eastern time here.

[00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:45.150]
The car.

[00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:46.030]
Baba, baba, baba.

[00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:46.430]
Oh, yeah.

[00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:49.790]
Don't hug the car, baby, now, Tony.

[00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:51.190]
Don't squeeze too tight.

[00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:52.610]
WQIM, hello.

[00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:54.630]
Hey, what's up?

[00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:55.430]
Yes, sir.

[00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:58.030]
Trying to find another way on the show yet.

[00:18:58.490 --> 00:18:58.850]
If what?

[00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.010]
If I could win any money today, I'm trying to find it.

[00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:02.030]
No, the answer is no.

[00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:03.010]
Do not call again.

[00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:05.630]
If you call one more time, we're going to send Luca Bratzie to your house to kill you.

[00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:05.970]
How's that?

[00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:09.090]
Don't ever call us again and we will break your neck.

[00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:10.910]
Get out of here, you idiot.

[00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:12.930]
Call us anytime you want.

[00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:14.250]
WQIM, hello.

[00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:15.150]
Check.

[00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.790]
Check this.

[00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:17.730]
Check in the mail.

[00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:18.510]
QIM, hello.

[00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:19.070]
No.

[00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:19.610]
Yeah.

[00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:21.750]
What about the chair of Randy Fedend?

[00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:23.450]
What happened to what?

[00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:25.230]
That chair of Randy Fedend.

[00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:26.550]
What ever happened to it?

[00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:28.650]
They're resuming it right now.

[00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:29.530]
And your body.

[00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:30.250]
Schmuck.

[00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:32.330]
Boy, these people talk about living in the past.

[00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:33.550]
Oh, my God.

[00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:34.290]
Yeah.

[00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:36.530]
I know what his favorite group is, the ink spots.

[00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:38.550]
Well, he thought they were ink spots, anyway.

[00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:41.230]
26 after 10 at 5.60.

[00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:45.170]
I think all calls today, I got a huge big pile of really important stuff here.

[00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:46.850]
I'm not going to waste my time with it.

[00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:48.290]
That will probably get you all depressed.

[00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:49.250]
I can save it for tomorrow.

[00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:50.070]
Yeah, whatever.

[00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:52.030]
Plus, you're on vacation next week anyway.

[00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:52.430]
Oh, good.

[00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:54.430]
So, we came to that. I'm on vacation and we're sliding into the summertime.

[00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:55.470]
There's nobody around.

[00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:56.410]
There's nobody in town.

[00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:56.750]
No.

[00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:57.550]
You're just kidding.

[00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:57.910]
You're just kidding.

[00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:00.230]
You know, as it was, we were playing about a third of a deck.

[00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:01.530]
Now it's like about a tenth of a deck.

[00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:03.810]
We got about 5.2 cards.

[00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:06.570]
Well, there's that picture of Alza Kaui sleeping.

[00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:07.750]
The eyes are closed.

[00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:10.470]
You think, you know, he's laying out there under a blanket out in the desert.

[00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:11.950]
Don't you look peaceful there?

[00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:12.770]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:13.850]
He looks in pieces there.

[00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:16.830]
And of course, you know that now that he's dead, he won't be any more killing in the orange

[00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:17.450]
fridge and so on.

[00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:18.470]
He's all over with everything.

[00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:19.570]
No, everything's going to be peaceful.

[00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:22.850]
Although I do wonder about all those other people who died this morning after he got

[00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:23.230]
fucked up.

[00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:23.810]
Well, they guessed it.

[00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:25.270]
I guess the message hadn't gotten enough.

[00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:25.710]
That's right.

[00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:26.250]
That's right.

[00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:27.910]
That now we're all going to be peacemakers.

[00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:29.090]
Blessed are the peacemakers.

[00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:30.650]
Remember, you know, I allow wallets to do that.

[00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:31.050]
Mm-hmm.

[00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:32.250]
Just before we eat the canola.

[00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:34.410]
Hey, if you love voting, who the hell doesn't, man?

[00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:37.110]
It's a real hoot to get out there in the water and you really ought to.

[00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:40.890]
But don't go spending a lot of money to buy a boat because the price and the maintenance

[00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:43.850]
of it and all the grief that goes along with it is just unbelievable.

[00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:47.450]
Just during hurricane season alone, just think of the possibilities.

[00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:51.690]
Instead of that called club.co and enjoy the water the easy way, one 800 boat rent.

[00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:54.990]
Why pay the expenses of boat ownership when you can rent one totally hassle free?

[00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:56.070]
Throw in the club.

[00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:56.370]
The club.

[00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:56.510]
The club.

[00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:56.670]
The club.

[00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:56.750]
The club.

[00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:56.770]

[00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.870]

[00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.870]

[00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:56.950]

[00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:56.950]

[00:20:57.170 --> 00:21:05.510]
The club.

[00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:11.170]
It's a smart way to go.

[00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:13.550]
Call 1-800-BOT-RENT.

[00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:16.070]
No getting the boat ready because club.co does it for you.

[00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:18.910]
No cleaning up either because the club.co just hop on your boat.

[00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:22.610]
Go out there and just have a spectacular time when you're done pulling to the dock.

[00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:23.830]
Get off and just run away.

[00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:24.410]
It's that easy.

[00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:25.890]
You know, take care of all the other business.

[00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:26.470]

[00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:30.490]
Not a code call 1-800-BOT-RENT from an unlimited voting to pay as you go from small boats to

[00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:32.150]
the charters and everything in between.

[00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:34.030]
It's club.co.co.

[00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:37.590]
Call 1-800-BOT-RENT to let club.co tailor plan to fit your needs and your budget.

[00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:42.870]
Get on the water today this smart way by calling club.co at 1-800-BOT-RENT.

[00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:44.870]
This is meal.

[00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.370]
Roger.

[00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:46.950]
We could go to the next.

[00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:48.330]

Get your hand like a friend, think quickly, walk the way.

[00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:41.470]
They had Joe, go to five-six-oh with ratings and the toilet mold to get those

[00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:45.950]
Playings for cold moans in order and control.

[00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:54.150]
And then so, Gully, Rolly, Joe above you and him the note he lets moan.

[00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:58.510]
Go and hear what blows, Gully, his own Joe.

[00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:04.910]
He'll make the big change and read a range.

[00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:07.910]
It's worse or the same.

[00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:10.890]
He hasn't done a thing.

[00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:14.950]
Oh, what goes on the air at two?

[00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:18.870]
Joe don't have a stinkin' clue out of four.

[00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:23.110]
My platycentially blows for all radio.

[00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:29.450]
But he ends of five-six-oh, Gully, Rolly, Joe.

[00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:30.110]
All right.

[00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:33.670]
10, 34, 5, 60, WQAM, happy Thursday to him.

[00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:35.810]
And we can start in the role along not too fast.

[00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:37.170]
We were bitchin' before.

[00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:40.530]
So if you're talking about a month, it's already the eighth of June.

[00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:44.530]
Yeah, I think mark it down right now and write it on your wrist.

[00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:47.890]
We're not doing any more crossovers, which also includes you on the summer schedule.

[00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:49.590]
We're all through with that. The show starts at 10.

[00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:54.330]
Let's at least between 10 and 2 start having some continuity.

[00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:56.090]
I do.

[00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:59.430]
Some consistency like the show starts at 10 and ends at 2.

[00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:02.410]
Almost every day. Yesterday I apologized and went about 15 seconds over.

[00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:04.270]
And why not just they chopped this off real faster?

[00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:07.850]
Like they might not have been able to say one more time.

[00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:09.130]
That's right. You don't want to spill over.

[00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:14.190]
I'm always so prompt, man. You could set your life on the atomic clock when we get down to two o'clock.

[00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:15.010]
Just about every day.

[00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:16.850]
Depending course, sometime they throw.

[00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:18.370]
In fact, you know what else are they doing?

[00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:25.530]
Remember we had the big debate about these lengthy rejoins and these promos that go on for like some of them 42nds, some of them almost a minute.

[00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:28.930]
So it takes basically the formative break and it makes it into a five minute break.

[00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:33.790]
So based on the way parents is programming us, we got like instead of, you know,

[00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:37.430]
it would be like having four or five minute newscasts an hour.

[00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:39.250]
Think of that CKLW documentary.

[00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:42.550]
You know, there used to be one five minute newscast on stations that didn't use.

[00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:43.990]
And then that was a lot.

[00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:45.570]
You know, that caused a lot of tune out.

[00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:49.610]
Like when stations used to be CBSF-related and carry CBS news at the top of the hour, five minutes.

[00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:56.190]
Now so basically we got the equivalent of four five minute newscasts based on the way clearances butchering this thing.

[00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:58.890]
So we don't have any time to waste.

[00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:01.910]
So nothing personal unless somebody wants to take it that way.

[00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:03.750]
But we're going back to a 10 o'clock start.

[00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:06.910]
And everybody, you know, they're all on their own. They got their own agenda.

[00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:10.530]
It's like everybody's got their own radio station kind of, you know what I mean?

[00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:11.230]
Oh yeah.

[00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:14.690]
They've got their own thing and they run schedule and if they got something more important to do,

[00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:19.570]
then we'll see them in a few days and hope that they feel okay and don't need too many below any sandwiches.

[00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:20.530]
Stuff like that.

[00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:25.390]
Although of course, you know, if we just had Ira on here a few more times, I think that would put us over the top.

[00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:27.870]
We'd get back to those great numbers we used to have once upon a time.

[00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:31.090]
I think we alien into the audience because we don't have Ira on this show.

[00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.930]
He's on every other show.

[00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:33.070]
Well, that's all your fault, you know.

[00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:37.870]
And probably also Tony for Antino and Eric Reed who talks to his teeth and all kind of like the spokesman.

[00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:41.150]
Not quite as much patuny, you know.

[00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:45.550]
When you're near the spokesman, you have to like keep towering yourself off because he has spitter.

[00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:47.870]
He is a spitter.

[00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:48.710]
That's Brian Murray.

[00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:49.530]
They're spokesman, man.

[00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:52.010]
You better know your spokesman, Mr. because you sure as hell don't.

[00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:52.590]
I don't.

[00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:53.870]
You better know BM.

[00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:56.130]
In fact, what I heard is you already knew it this morning.

[00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:56.670]
That's right.

[00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:57.790]
Colleagues life.

[00:25:57.970 --> 00:25:58.670]
The way to hear this.

[00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:01.490]
This is a, see, a coast of Shoei, man. I'm going back to college.

[00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:04.210]
Colleagues life isn't just about drinking beer.

[00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:15.610]
In a rare instance, Apple computer, Inc's iconic iPod music player surpassed beer drinking as the most in thing among undergraduate college students according to the latest biennual market research study.

[00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:21.270]
Any other item on list that also included text messaging, bar hopping and download and music.

[00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:23.630]
I'm sure they didn't put getting laid on there, but why would they do that?

[00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:25.650]
You know, you're a go study.

[00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:30.950]
I'm just telling you right now, MP3 players are like for little kids like elementary school.

[00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:31.750]
That's what an iPod is.

[00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:33.550]
And Sony bought, no, it is not.

[00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:34.070]
Okay.

[00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:36.630]
An iPod is not an MP3 player.

[00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:37.050]
Okay.

[00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:40.150]
I have an MP3 player.

[00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:41.310]
It's for all people like her and me.

[00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:43.970]
It's for all cards like us, but it's an MP3 player.

[00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:46.830]
What do you think it does?

[00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:50.010]
Now, what do your wife hate you like?

[00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:51.770]
Poison and wishes you would croak a wicked death.

[00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:55.370]
This year, drinking beer and Facebook.com, a social networking website,

[00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:56.750]
we're time for second most popular.

[00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:00.550]
With 71% of students identifying them as in, Facebook.com.

[00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:02.470]
I never heard of that before.

[00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:04.210]
It's like my space.

[00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:06.090]
Oh, well, that we know about that thing.

[00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:06.390]
Okay.

[00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:11.170]
I close me at his iPod laying right there on his public.

[00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:17.250]
Student monitor conducted survey week of March 6, interviewing full-time undergrad students at 100 US colleges.

[00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:18.230]
Yadi-adiya.

[00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:20.650]
They did not ask them about whether getting laid.

[00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:23.390]
I just, I don't want it.

[00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:27.110]
I guess I'm not fooling anybody on that count.

[00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:29.590]
Hey, listen, nothing is great.

[00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:30.710]
What, your shaver?

[00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:32.590]
Every two days I use that baby.

[00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:35.050]
That thing I got, whatever that is.

[00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:39.610]
That's sharp cutter, razor, shaver, against the sharp knife.

[00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:42.110]
In fact, you know something if I were there right now, you'd say,

[00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:45.770]
the thing I'm not, because I would probably find a sharp knife like that machete

[00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:48.630]
and do like a Stephen Harper on your head.

[00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:52.050]
My team before 11 a.k.w.M. the summer season is approaching fast.

[00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:55.210]
That means it must be close to Father's Day and you want to know what it's a week from this Sunday.

[00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:56.690]
Come on up Sunday, June 18.

[00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:59.150]
We all know what dads like to do on their big day.

[00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:02.030]
And when they're through doing that and maybe before they're doing that, they'd love to eat.

[00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:05.330]
It's time to call the melting pot, make your reservation for Father's Day.

[00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:07.030]
Do something great this year for your Father.

[00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:10.150]
The melting pot is a fantastic, unique fondue restaurant.

[00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:11.890]
And this is their famous cheese and chocolates.

[00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:15.370]
They serve up some serious meats and fish for hungry dads like yours.

[00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:20.810]
Party on praise from Sena Kuttele Minyantu, Black and Shrimp, Teriyaki Surla, and Torg Lopster and more.

[00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:22.410]
And it's not just a meal.

[00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:27.230]
It's like an experience when you go there because you're dipping and dunking and eating and the smiling and laughing.

[00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:29.370]
The melting pot, in fact, you can take your iPod with you.

[00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:32.150]
The melting pot definitely serves serious food for serious appetite.

[00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:33.710]
Nobody walks out of there hungry.

[00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:36.430]
They waddle out of there with a big smile on their face and a big fat puppet.

[00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:38.650]
They also have an award winning and wine list to boot.

[00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:41.030]
And don't forget the melting pot's famous desserts, man.

[00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:45.350]
When dad dips that into the chocolate, he'll just go nuts. He'll be go ballistic.

[00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:47.370]
Guarantee to put a big smile on his push.

[00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:48.550]
So make that call today.

[00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:51.550]
Make your reservations and invite dad to dip into something different and delicious.

[00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:55.370]
A real fantastic experience at the Velting Pot restaurant near you.

[00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:57.570]
A full four-course gift for dad from you.

[00:28:57.910 --> 00:29:01.570]
And when you call to make those reservations, be sure until the cranky old meal, Torg Lidikal.

[00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:08.250]
There's a melting pot and coral springs in Boka, Fort Lauderdale, North Miami Beach, Cooper City, and of course in highly congested Kendall.

[00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:10.670]
This is Neil Roger.

[00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:15.010]
This is 5'16 QAX.

[00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:18.230]
And a lot like hot little boy.

[00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:24.530]
Tom Hanks stars in a film that will shake the very foundation of the Western world.

[00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:26.090]
The Gump Code.

[00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:29.250]
The tone of the painting, Gump, Death Plane, Super.

[00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:31.470]
It's stupid as as Super does, sir.

[00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:35.010]
Does the Gump Code reveal a secret, secret bloodline?

[00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:36.270]
I'm not a smart man.

[00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:39.970]
I'll know what that is. That's the wise of baby Jesus.

[00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:43.010]
Exposing the truth can be a dangerous thing.

[00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:46.530]
If all's not mistaken, I think that all bottom-hand was trying to kill me.

[00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:48.330]
Run for it, run!

[00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:49.490]
Okay.

[00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:53.030]
Does that all bottom-hand get contagious?

[00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:55.990]
Will history be changed forever?

[00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:57.910]
History's like a box of chocolates.

[00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:59.850]
You never know what you're gonna get.

[00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:02.850]
The truth lies in the Gump Code.

[00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:04.590]
And that's all I got to say about that.

[00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:07.670]
It's 10.46. Well, is he an actor?

[00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:09.370]
What? He is just dynamic.

[00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:14.250]
Oh, yeah. Although I do have a poll I'm thinking for tomorrow about overrated TV stars, we've never done that.

[00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:20.610]
We can do overrated actors and actresses to do something more like TV people, like Seinfeld, Tim DeBulk, Vanna.

[00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:25.570]
Vanna, by the way, just turned 88 and by the way she refuses to get on the plane with Cancer and Harris this weekend.

[00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:28.450]
She's got a premonition that something horrible is gonna happen.

[00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:30.170]
And the Republicans are hoping that she's right.

[00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:31.570]
Oh, yeah.

[00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:37.390]
There was that article I had there that she's been described as a pariah by the Republican Party, Cancer and Harris.

[00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:38.950]
They don't want her to run.

[00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:42.790]
She's looking at a Chinaman's chance in purgatory, but nevertheless she's a stubborn bitch.

[00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:44.970]
I'm probably jet-promised to her anyway, you know.

[00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:46.650]
For help and fix her, 2000.

[00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:50.030]
5.670560, let's get these phones on fire, baby.

[00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:50.890]
Let's get with it.

[00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:54.430]
I realize it's the dog days. It's the getting to be the middle of June already.

[00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:59.130]
There are only about 400 people left in town and they're not too happy about it anyway, but they ain't got any money to get out of town.

[00:30:59.510 --> 00:30:59.970]
Like you guys.

[00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:04.690]
5.670560 and pound 560 and they've Verizon and Singular Wireless Live.

[00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:06.190]
When you need them the most, they're not there.

[00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:08.470]
Just remember that all summer long. Keep that one away.

[00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:08.870]
You know what?

[00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:10.130]
I know all about it.

[00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:12.830]
Oh, and when you don't want them the most then they are there.

[00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:14.330]
You know, it's where I catch my grief on that.

[00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:17.570]
When you're just monologuing into all the lines and line up like, what the hell do these people do?

[00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:19.510]
Yeah, exactly. That happens all the time.

[00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:25.010]
When our 6-minute delay case is up there and they get onto this thing and we're going to be taking a lot of calls, then they're going to be foaming.

[00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:27.190]
You'll see. Like this one here. WQAM.

[00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:27.770]
Hey!

[00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:29.230]
Ah, huh? Statolia.

[00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:30.470]
I could smell it.

[00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:31.410]
Many miles away.

[00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:34.070]
Now you tell me that's a Gilbert Jr. that's an imitator?

[00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:34.950]
That is an imitator.

[00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:36.610]
Oh, well, so what's that all about?

[00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:39.090]
He's got a fan club. What can I tell you?

[00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:39.850]
Does he really?

[00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:46.950]
Well, I'm sure that he and the guy with the eyes and the guy with the yellow teeth, I'm sure they probably hang out together as a fatty pack guy with a fanny bag right in the course.

[00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:48.170]
Yeah, all that crowd.

[00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:50.770]
Not to mention what's his name up there, Port St. Loosely.

[00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:52.430]
Oh, no, they're not saying.

[00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:53.570]
Oh, don't even say that.

[00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:54.450]
I don't know what it is.

[00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:54.970]
I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is.

[00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:55.110]
I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is.

[00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:56.790]
I think about it. He'll be on I know.

[00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:58.130]
And of course, what's his name in Hollywood?

[00:31:58.530 --> 00:31:59.130]
Uh-huh.

[00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:00.430]
Or them all that crowd.

[00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:03.090]
See, one thing about doing this in this market and on this station especially,

[00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:08.690]
more so than any place else I've ever even dreamed of working is that once you get rid of the first group of, uh,

[00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:12.730]
Luntex, there's a whole another new one like the guy who wants to know how much money he's gonna win.

[00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:14.870]
Not at least he's at least at least a change.

[00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:17.270]
Yeah, I enjoy him a little bit a little bit.

[00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:18.790]
Probably up to this next hour.

[00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:21.110]
I'll probably get tired of him, but they're like a series.

[00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:22.570]
It doesn't matter how many you blow up.

[00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:23.170]
That's right.

[00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:26.470]
Like that Abuza al Zal Al Zarqawi guy.

[00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:31.370]
You blow up on service and there's a hundred thousand more waiting in line to take their place to be the next big hero.

[00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:33.030]
WQAM, hello.

[00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:35.430]
That was a good one. QAM, hello.

[00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:36.550]
Hello, Neil.

[00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:37.290]
Yes, sir.

[00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.970]
How you doing?

[00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:38.570]
Long time.

[00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:39.310]
A couple of times.

[00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:43.490]
Anyway, listen, I finally got some, uh, broadband from my mobile over here.

[00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:45.510]
So I can actually respond to your poll.

[00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:47.790]
Like, uh, I do have a question for you.

[00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:52.010]
Do you guys have, like an email site where I can send you some crap once in a while?

[00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:52.510]
No.

[00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:53.070]
No.

[00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:53.510]
Okay.

[00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:55.190]
No, you can email the George.

[00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:56.890]
George, what is it?

[00:32:57.450 --> 00:32:58.090]
NeilRajas.com.

[00:32:58.270 --> 00:32:58.450]
George.

[00:32:58.590 --> 00:32:58.690]
George.

[00:32:58.690 --> 00:32:58.830]
George.

[00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:02.550]
I'll read it without reading it.

[00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:02.710]
I'll delete it without reading it.

[00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:03.110]
Right.

[00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:04.350]
All right.

[00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:04.770]
Okay.

[00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:11.370]
By the way, speaking of emailing, don't email me that stuff anymore because my, uh, my email outfit is blocked it.

[00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:11.850]
Okay.

[00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:12.830]
I'll just send it to the other person.

[00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:13.330]
Don't.

[00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:13.730]
Yeah.

[00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:14.350]
That's right.

[00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:14.990]
Do it the other way.

[00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.290]
Yeah.

[00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:17.370]
Don't be, uh, don't be sent to me.

[00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:20.650]
No, uh, you know, stuff on my, I don't want to get crap on my computer.

[00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:21.250]
Got it.

[00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:25.210]
I got it because probably the RCMP and the Gotterwin knows what else, you know.

[00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:28.490]
Probably be a whole bunch of subversive lunatics running around here.

[00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:29.110]
Oh my god.

[00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:30.650]
He's got all kinds of, yeah, right.

[00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:32.050]
I got news for him, man.

[00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:35.250]
This studio is clean and pristine for the old queen.

[00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:36.910]
WQI am, hello.

[00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:37.870]
Yes, sir.

[00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:38.370]
Uncle Neil.

[00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:39.350]
Yes, tell me.

[00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:45.290]
How are you able to be physically recognized after being blown up with two 500 pound bombs?

[00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:49.950]
It was like, actually, he looks pretty good for a guy that just got blown up.

[00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:50.850]
That is a good point.

[00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:53.350]
I think they better check him for freezer burn.

[00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:54.050]
Yeah.

[00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:57.310]
Okay.

[00:33:57.850 --> 00:33:58.650]
That is a good point.

[00:33:58.810 --> 00:33:59.650]
He had a nice, yeah.

[00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:02.310]
And he looks remarkably well preserved, doesn't he?

[00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:03.570]
Yes, he does, but it's a good thing.

[00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:07.290]
You almost get to think that they had that body laying around for a while just for the opportune moment.

[00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:08.770]
You know, like to, oh, here he is.

[00:34:08.910 --> 00:34:09.470]
It's irrelevant.

[00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:11.370]
No, it's not irrelevant.

[00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:12.290]
The media is on time.

[00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:13.090]
There's a look at that tone.

[00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:13.830]
Oh, I don't know, man.

[00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.150]
Totally.

[00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:14.610]

[00:34:14.890 --> 00:34:15.870]
The car used to take four.

[00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:16.490]
But it moved, but it moved.

[00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:17.070]
But about everything.

[00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:17.690]
Oh, yeah.

[00:34:17.910 --> 00:34:18.810]
What kind of a voice is that?

[00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:19.150]
I can't do that.

[00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:19.310]
I can't do that.

[00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:19.730]
Damn thing.

[00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:20.370]
I'm not saying a separate effect.

[00:34:20.490 --> 00:34:21.750]
I'm not going to manipulate the media.

[00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:24.230]
And the Democrats don't know the scream or peeler banana.

[00:34:24.450 --> 00:34:25.690]
They're just, oh, what do we do now?

[00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:26.590]
What do we do?

[00:34:27.410 --> 00:34:31.630]
I still think it would have been kind of a hoot to see Stephen Harper without that good head on his shoulders.

[00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:33.650]
And he could have been like the ikabab crane of Canada.

[00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:35.250]
WQAM, hello.

[00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:37.530]
And back at you.

[00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:39.170]
WQAM, hello.

[00:34:39.490 --> 00:34:41.590]
W. Rachel is 1040 and KXC.

[00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:42.190]
You don't care.

[00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:42.730]
Go away.

[00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:43.610]
Okay, dial right.

[00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:44.490]
You're one.

[00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:45.630]
I'll make an exception for you.

[00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:47.110]
We're not talking about that today.

[00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:48.630]
W-H-O.

[00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:50.650]
I, in your case, I say W-H-A-T.

[00:34:50.890 --> 00:34:51.030]
Okay.

[00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:51.670]
What?

[00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:53.790]
Actually, there is a station W-H-A-T.

[00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:54.270]
What?

[00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:55.670]
I think Tana works on it.

[00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:57.050]
I know what else he works on.

[00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:57.550]
What?

[00:34:59.290 --> 00:34:59.570]
56670560.

[00:34:59.970 --> 00:34:59.970]

[00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:00.550]
Just relax.

[00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:01.070]
Okay.

[00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:01.730]
We don't know.

[00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:02.750]
It was a rhetorical question.

[00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:03.850]
Just march right along.

[00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:04.250]
Okay.

[00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:05.170]
Don't even go there.

[00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:05.650]
They say.

[00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:06.550]
I don't want to go there.

[00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:06.930]
I don't.

[00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.270]
Yeah.

[00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:08.230]
Well, go ahead.

[00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:09.430]
I'll put the two of you in a good time.

[00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:09.830]
You know what the people say.

[00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:11.110]
You know what I want to go there.

[00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.530]
No, no.

[00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:13.370]
56670560.

[00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:16.110]
We want some new and different people today.

[00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:17.270]
We want some women, man.

[00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:18.970]
We want some lady callers.

[00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:20.550]
Enough that bitch that called the other day.

[00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:21.650]
What the hell was she battling about?

[00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:22.230]
Remember that one?

[00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:22.870]
No.

[00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:25.130]
This is the only lady call we're heading about six months.

[00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:26.130]
I forget what she was on.

[00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:26.530]
Not job.

[00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:27.490]
Don't remember her?

[00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.930]
No.

[00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:29.330]
Crazy with that a bed bug.

[00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:30.530]
I'm actually Josh remembers it.

[00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:31.010]
That's how it does.

[00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:32.030]
Oh, yeah, her.

[00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.970]
She was bad.

[00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:38.290]
70 Q.A.M. Hello.

[00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:39.210]
Hello, Neil.

[00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:39.870]
Yes.

[00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:40.790]
How you doing?

[00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:42.110]
I'm doing great.

[00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:42.770]
How are you doing?

[00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:43.690]
I'm doing fine.

[00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:43.970]
A.M.

[00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:44.190]
Listen.

[00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:48.090]
I just wanted to call to thank you for recommending the show.

[00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:51.790]
Like to monitor the show about the, you know, the history channel.

[00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:52.190]
Remember?

[00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:54.370]
On my history channel?

[00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:57.050]
Yeah, I got the church on other hiding spree,

[00:35:57.110 --> 00:35:57.770]
the center of the battle.

[00:35:57.830 --> 00:35:58.390]
On A.M.

[00:35:58.490 --> 00:35:59.150]
Yeah, on the A.M.

[00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:00.590]
On the angels.

[00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:01.490]
Yeah, I remember.

[00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:01.950]
Yeah, I remember.

[00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:02.770]
That was a demon's right.

[00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:03.210]
Right.

[00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:05.890]
That was the documentary next to 5.00 and 11.

[00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:06.410]
Thank you.

[00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:06.950]
Okay.

[00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:07.590]
Thank you.

[00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:08.270]
You're welcome.

[00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:10.070]
Well, there's a guy that actually wants to.

[00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:12.170]
That's the first call I've had about that thing.

[00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:13.530]
There's somebody that actually wants it.

[00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:13.730]
Right.

[00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:15.150]
But we don't have the impact that we used to have.

[00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:15.990]
That's the four of the audience.

[00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:19.250]
That before Joe Bell came along and turned us into a way that Chinese is laundry.

[00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:20.430]
Uh-huh.

[00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:25.070]
It's just, you know, I think I've got to make me a mid-year resolution just to stop even.

[00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:27.850]
Forget about thinking about it because if I think about it then I talk about it.

[00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:27.950]
Right.

[00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:31.290]
So there's no point in saying don't talk about it because as long as you're thinking about it,

[00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:32.310]
then you are going to talk about it.

[00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:34.010]
Maybe you say hypnotherapy or acupuncture.

[00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:34.690]
That's what I need.

[00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:38.850]
I need to be deep program because I'm just so aghast that it's the 8th of June and they're still

[00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:40.270]
fumbling and bumbling.

[00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:43.630]
I mean, you know, if we're running back fumbles about all this many times,

[00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:45.210]
they're going to get like farmed out, man.

[00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:48.490]
They're going to get like shipped out to a Siberia somewhere or to Ethiopia.

[00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:50.410]
Well, you could always consider it this way.

[00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:50.850]
Yeah.

[00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:52.270]
Whatever they do, it's going to suck anyway.

[00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:56.050]
Yeah, but they're not to, but they're not to, look, I wouldn't mind if they did something in a suck,

[00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:57.030]
but they're not doing anything.

[00:36:57.330 --> 00:36:58.590]
Well, they're doing something all right.

[00:36:59.230 --> 00:36:59.790]
They're doing something.

[00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:00.990]
They're, they're killing it.

[00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:01.970]
They're butchering it.

[00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:06.390]
If you hear any squealing noises, it's like a cat being butchered without any, you know.

[00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:08.270]
That's what's happening to us here at QAM.

[00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:09.250]
Please, the system.

[00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:10.370]
Please throw us an anchor.

[00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:12.090]
Throw us a light bag.

[00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:14.030]
Oh, wrong, wrong, wrong, swale.

[00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:14.330]
Sorry.

[00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:16.070]
What is this thing?

[00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:18.550]
Uh, you know, yeah, I'm so tired of this crap.

[00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:20.210]
You know, there's nothing.

[00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:21.730]
Crackberries, my ass.

[00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:22.750]
Oh, bet.

[00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:26.490]
Oh, and if you got a lot of, at least mohad dingleberries, I got a lot of crackberries.

[00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:26.770]
Yeah.

[00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:31.750]
I got instead of, you know, instead of Martians in my house, you know, I got crackberries,

[00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:32.950]
different, like marble rings.

[00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:36.890]
Blackberry addicts have a crack at freedom when they check in a one Chicago hotel.

[00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:39.970]
The manager will put the communicative devices and others like them under lock and key

[00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:40.870]
for guests who want to break.

[00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:42.570]
Oh, give me a break.

[00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:43.970]
Oh.

[00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:44.330]

[00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:49.250]
Ricky Wayno, general manager of the Sheraton Chicago hotel, said the program began on Wednesday,

[00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:51.910]
grew up as own personal Blackberry addiction.

[00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:54.850]
His one step recovery was switching to a regular cell phone.

[00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:56.650]
I was really addicted to my Blackberry.

[00:37:56.770 --> 00:37:59.390]
I had to have a session with email, he told Reuters, morning and night.

[00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:01.130]
There came a time when I didn't think it was healthy.

[00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:02.030]
I quit cold turkey.

[00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:03.410]
Well, what's wrong with email?

[00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:05.030]
I don't understand that.

[00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:06.030]
It's just an added convenience.

[00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:08.050]
You don't have to go home or wherever you're out right.

[00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:08.690]
PC is.

[00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:09.610]
You know, I am.

[00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:12.490]
And you don't have to pay any attention to it unless you want to.

[00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:13.130]
Exactly.

[00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:17.050]
Many at many times, they just turn it off for a few hours and then when I turn it back on,

[00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:20.410]
it's like vibrates and buzzes and pukes and it catches up with whatever was on it.

[00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:20.910]
That's fine.

[00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:22.610]
Yeah.

[00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:25.630]
I run a hotel with over 900 employees and thousands of guests.

[00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:26.550]
I think I'm more effective.

[00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:27.110]
I feel better.

[00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:27.690]
I sleep better.

[00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:29.850]
My family likes to be said of his post Blackberry life.

[00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:35.070]
The popular handheld device is called crackberries because users become so reliant on them or made

[00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:36.730]
by Canadian based research in motion.

[00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:38.930]
It puts the motion in your packet.

[00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:40.110]
God.

[00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:41.530]
I can't say packet.

[00:38:41.970 --> 00:38:42.110]
Nope.

[00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:42.950]
Not normal.

[00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:46.530]
Especially now that the house passed that thing yesterday and the bush is going to sign in

[00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:49.330]
the law, the new indecency bill, they're going to try and get $80,000.

[00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:54.850]
You're going to have to get the poll of the mayor, Mani D. as his son, to print up a whole bunch of money.

[00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:57.250]
It's time to forget about those tens and twenties.

[00:38:57.250 --> 00:38:59.070]
We need a thousand dollar bills.

[00:38:59.210 --> 00:39:00.650]
Okay son, a lot of them.

[00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:05.290]
We've got to print up a lot of phone bills to pay all MSCC fines that are coming down to everybody for being the

[00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:05.570]
audience.

[00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:06.490]
In fact, look at that.

[00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:08.070]
They got Tony Snow on CNN right now.

[00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:09.030]
They had to be fine for that.

[00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:09.950]
Damn it.

[00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:10.970]
Oh, we're fine.

[00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:11.790]
I mean darn it.

[00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:14.450]
1056 and 560 WQM.

[00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:15.790]
You're used to be great station.

[00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:19.990]
Remember that deer to be great with Glen Turner with the hair lift and I keep throwing that at you and you still have no idea who that was?

[00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:20.370]
Who?

[00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:21.790]
I can't believe that.

[00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:22.570]
He had a hair lift.

[00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:25.030]
He had to be great with all my best friends.

[00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:25.930]
I had a hair lift.

[00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:27.070]
Still doesn't sure.

[00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:28.450]
And you probably make fun of him.

[00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:29.610]
I did to his face.

[00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:30.450]
Well good.

[00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:31.730]
That's very nice.

[00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:32.370]
That's very nice.

[00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:33.350]
He was a sword.

[00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:34.730]
That would be like making fun of blind Mike.

[00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:36.650]
620 votes on a pool.

[00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:37.350]

We're at the end of the first hour.

[00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:42.750]
What's your initial take on the pool?

[00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:44.130]
Are we going to get to our thousand or not?

[00:39:44.330 --> 00:39:45.910]
Oh, what a very doubtful.

[00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:46.510]
What do you think, Josh?

[00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:47.310]
Sure.

[00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:48.250]
I think we have.

[00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:49.590]
We got to get to 800 by noon.

[00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:50.790]
Can we do it?

[00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:51.230]
Yes.

[00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:53.590]

[00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:41.210]
No, limperist. Oh

[00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:47.670]
637 votes on a pool so far. I don't know. I'm really dubious man. We got to get to 800 that say 850 by the top of the

[00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:51.850]
New Nour or no. Well, that's right. It's only 1102. I'm thinking it's new. That's right

[00:42:51.850 --> 00:42:56.070]
And I thought I want to push it young. I'm in a big hurry to get out of here, but you are no I'm not

[00:42:56.070 --> 00:42:59.930]
You're gonna take all the time we want you're cuz I just made up my mind during that break

[00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:04.070]
I say anything to myself gosh dang it as buddy, but Paxton would say in

[00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:08.130]
Yeah gosh dang it. I'm gonna start doing the show the way I want to do it

[00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:12.730]
I don't give a damn about clearance about normal camp about Joe Bell and Ring of Bell and

[00:43:12.730 --> 00:43:16.950]
Ring of Ding Ding all these other idiots who pretending or something about this business

[00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:20.770]
You put the three of them together. They wouldn't know a radio if he shoved four dozen of them up their ass

[00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:24.510]
I'm gonna you know so how would that cross over thing? I don't like it, you know

[00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:28.430]
I'll just email how's that? No, no, I'm just telling you right now. It's not gonna happen no more

[00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:33.550]
Not with me sitting here because whenever basically he's you know working for us and not for somebody else

[00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:37.950]
That's when we do it. You know when it's convenient either that's not programming programming is a well

[00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:42.230]
We'll do something when it's convenient for us when we feel like it or when I don't have something better going on

[00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:47.670]
Well, what kind of crap is that? That would be like my saying. Oh, guess what? I won't be in tomorrow. I got something better to do, you know

[00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:52.510]
How do you think that how do you think they would react to that you think they would cotton to that?

[00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:55.750]
They would say something along the lines of oh my god or something

[00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:59.590]
I don't know what they'll say but I'm sure it's how they wouldn't just stick over the finger up each other's ass

[00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:02.150]
Well, they might they've already got that now

[00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:04.650]
I'm just gonna start to do it if I want to play a little music in here

[00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:09.970]
Whatever the hell we want to do man. It's the near-roger show. It's not the Joe Bell show. It's not the Clare and Stereo show

[00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:15.910]
It's not the Norma Ken show. Thank God talking a 400-year-old geeks on the light bulb about their Colossomy bag

[00:44:16.330 --> 00:44:20.030]
My god, and he's representing me. How do you ever hook me up with him?

[00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:26.830]
But oh god, Norma. Oh, I'm sorry about that. You know, it's the gate thing. That must be it and the weed red band

[00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:32.330]
That must be it the weed thing there. I knew there was a connection with you somewhere along the line the weed thing

[00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:41.250]
That's right. We're smoking boys. You got pipeline the bombside pipeline. Yeah, that's right that water pipeline red banners with urgent tags appeared on many Arab TV stations today

[00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:46.230]
As the regions major stations broke at a regular program. We do not some of the biggest news in months the death of terrorists

[00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:48.930]
Obu Musab al Zarkawi better known as Al

[00:44:49.570 --> 00:44:54.990]
Islamic extremist websites were also quick to carry the news and in their case lamented and that guy made a very good point

[00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:59.330]
Because they're showing the bombs that keep showing us over and over again about how they dropped these big ones

[00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:02.670]
They knew he was there. He looks at pristine and he looks a little tired

[00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:06.810]
But other than that he looks no no worse for where you know when you agree with that I would

[00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:09.890]
They don't even look like somebody hit him in the head with a rock. I mean

[00:45:09.890 --> 00:45:13.450]
Realistically speaking, you know, they drop those bombs on the buildings and you know how that happens

[00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:18.470]
He got hit with a breeze and then he got put it doesn't look like he even got like fish. What's up a little bit?

[00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:22.330]
Well, maybe they've touched them up. No, they wouldn't want to do that. They wouldn't know

[00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:25.650]
Look at that. There's the picture man. He don't even look like he's got a zip

[00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:29.290]
But I mean, there's like blood around his head like I got squashed get out of here

[00:45:29.290 --> 00:45:32.910]
What what are you looking at I'm looking at it right now. Yeah, you're looking at it

[00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:36.230]
But it's not I mean you mean looking at somebody's head all right, but I think it's yours

[00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:38.090]
Islamic extremist websites

[00:45:38.090 --> 00:45:42.870]
So we're lamenting it a no posted on one website known as the clearinghouse for al-Qaeda interrac statements

[00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:47.310]
Shortly after the news of al Zarkawi's death broke on TV and said we hope this news is not true

[00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:49.310]
If she calls our cow he has died

[00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:54.850]
He will go to heaven God willing and there'll be 200 million al Zarkawi's after him set another no posted on the site

[00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:58.250]
It made me that 200 million, but it's gonna be a whole lot of now

[00:45:58.250 --> 00:46:00.650]
They're really gonna get all whipped up and filming at the mouth

[00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:05.170]
Somebody said a very wise philosopher said back three years ago when his whole craft started

[00:46:05.170 --> 00:46:08.050]
They shouldn't poke that hornet's nest. They made a bad mistake

[00:46:08.050 --> 00:46:11.190]
Bad mistake. They're the great job. They didn't have Afghanistan

[00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:17.150]
Not and now they're doing the same great job at Iraq. It's bloodshed and murder and insanity and lunatic

[00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:19.310]
2500 Americans are dead

[00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:25.890]
18,000 more injured many of those without limbs and eyes and body parts that they might like to have cat held on to

[00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:32.850]
In order for this to happen. Wow. We now don't you feel a lot safer? I sure do wasn't a threat to us here in America

[00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:34.490]
It's safe to go back to the mall now

[00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:36.270]
Did you just get cut off?

[00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:42.430]
Confused the media with that. No, no confused them with that point because freedom's on the march and missions accomplished

[00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:45.770]
Hahaha. Oh, yeah. Here's another mission accomplished

[00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:48.830]
I'm gonna tell you right now you can blame the bush people all you want

[00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:53.270]
There is no question there. It's not even debatable point the American media

[00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:57.110]
Are the ones if you want to point to finger man take that big nasty finger in fact

[00:46:57.110 --> 00:46:59.790]
I don't even care what you got on it and just point it right in their direction

[00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:05.230]
Because they're co-conspirators without them. This could never all unfolded the way it has this butchery

[00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:09.510]
And by the way here's an article by Catherine Schrader on Capitol Hill blue your very favorite website

[00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:11.710]
I don't want to read the whole thing. I don't want to get too newsy

[00:47:11.710 --> 00:47:16.030]
But she says the death of al-Qaeda air in irracial leader Abu Moussad al-Zerkawi

[00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:20.830]
A lot of US counterterrorism officials an initial sigh really for what they held as a significant development

[00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:25.350]
But they quickly cautioned against expecting it to enter operations or violence in Iraq

[00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:34.570]
US general George Casey the top-of-scomender and erectile reporters were the development that the development would not in the insurgency and an official in Washington requested anonymity

[00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:37.610]
Said it should not cause anyone to have unrealistic expectations

[00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:44.210]
As the day wore on a news of the US military's most dramatic victory in Iraq in recent months dominated casual conversations in the NATO building

[00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:47.770]
The fence secretary rose for you'll stay publicly mum and out of reach of the media

[00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:50.570]
The impact of al-Zerkawi death is nonetheless symbolic

[00:47:50.570 --> 00:47:57.090]
US hasn't seen the elimination of such an iconic figure since former president Sada Hussein was found an underground bunker in late 2003

[00:47:57.090 --> 00:47:57.550]
alleged

[00:47:57.550 --> 00:48:00.550]
Remember they said that that sir was also fabricated right?

[00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:05.750]
All the al-Zerkawi was considered well. We know this but I beat the boot but about then the incident so yeah

[00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:07.230]
You ain't seen up in the end

[00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:10.570]
You deal with crazy people who are living in a stone age

[00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:14.910]
We have a little or no respect for human life especially hours by the way right

[00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:19.670]
We get a crazy people Pat Robertson claims to outlist linebackers feel the burn it burns

[00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:24.890]
He said if Angela's concedes he cheated when leg pressing a ton he cheated a little bit

[00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:28.690]
Religious broad and it's got a picture of him here. It's just it's just hysterical

[00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:34.410]
It's like the picture of moxie tongue. You know swimming across the Yangtze River. Merlin. Yes, I just we got two facts

[00:48:34.410 --> 00:48:37.590]
About that already today about what the Pat Robertson story you're reading right now

[00:48:37.590 --> 00:48:42.690]
I'm on top of it here just right this is like normal Kent sending me that stupid idiotic email yesterday about the

[00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:45.990]
About the indecency building. I can't handle it

[00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:50.590]
I'm just so sick and tired of all these experts out there. They're helping. They're helping. They're not helping

[00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:55.930]
The only thing he's helping me too is like stepping out of my patio and jumping from several floors up

[00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:57.610]
That's about what he's got me on a verge of doing

[00:48:57.610 --> 00:48:58.790]
You know we're getting ready

[00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:03.370]
My vacation is in my after next week and then we got to summer schedule going

[00:49:03.370 --> 00:49:06.530]
You know just like you said why do you want to like

[00:49:07.410 --> 00:49:09.670]
Stick that thing in the locust cage?

[00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:14.850]
I want to run away a hornet's nest why why do it just leave bad enough alone normal? Okay?

[00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:15.650]
Just stop

[00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:17.450]
Confediently and you know

[00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:21.550]
He don't speak for me. He hasn't got any idea what those going on what the issues are

[00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:23.270]
I'm sure he'll make something better program

[00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:25.570]
Well, it's just like you keep making up stories about how they keep this

[00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:28.790]
Combobulating our studio when they have these ball games on well, you know, I'm a trouble maker

[00:49:29.310 --> 00:49:33.110]
I'm just saying you were a trouble maker in your relyer. This has been going on for the seven and a half years

[00:49:33.110 --> 00:49:36.810]
We've been in that studio. They're on the third floor and they've been doing it every single time

[00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:41.910]
The children they got running and when you wait here was the first play pen with your own I know

[00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:46.590]
I seen it a million times and every time you go in on the stress out on Monday morning after they've

[00:49:46.590 --> 00:49:49.570]
Dittled around with everything in there and all the settings are unsettling

[00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:52.830]
We can't get the thing on it. It takes us 15 minutes or 20 minutes or a half an hour

[00:49:52.830 --> 00:49:57.730]
Just to get back to being able to like communicate again. Oh, no. Jar just makes those things up

[00:49:57.730 --> 00:50:01.650]
He just a trouble maker. I know. Yeah, I think you ought to get a hitman for clearance

[00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:03.650]
I think what I think raised you got now that normal

[00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:08.790]
Get a hitman for that. Don't don't go to my hand over here. You don't know what I'm sure it on two legs man

[00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:13.330]
In fact, yeah, he and I heard that he couldn't robber told me that he had to hot date

[00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:16.410]
You know, he couldn't get the turd base much less. He's gonna get the first base

[00:50:17.310 --> 00:50:21.570]
Religious broadcaster Pat Robertson says it's the God's honest truth. Of course. He's talking about

[00:50:21.570 --> 00:50:25.810]
God, he did indeed once leg press a ton when he was almost

[00:50:26.370 --> 00:50:30.410]
73 and had prostate cancer and still regularly lifts up to twelve hundred pounds with his legs

[00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:35.590]
The only pounds he's lifting are pounds of manure. Okay. Oh, hey, there's another picture of pressure

[00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:39.510]
Oh, now there's a little bit of blood that looks like it was smeared on the side of his teeth

[00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:45.230]
That looks about as phony as a $42 bill like paint. Yeah, I'm worried that that come from all of a sudden wasn't on the other picture

[00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:46.590]
The

[00:50:47.050 --> 00:50:50.830]
The acknowledge that the way he like presses would not be legal in a bodybuilding competition

[00:50:50.830 --> 00:50:54.690]
You know when I see part Robertson is what I always think of bodybuilder. All right. What do you think of?

[00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:59.650]
Uh-huh great athlete just like Jack Lillian. Oh, yeah, Jack Lillian by the way

[00:50:59.650 --> 00:51:04.570]
He's got that juicer. He just turned 91. You don't look at day over 150 and you you know, and he is wife

[00:51:04.570 --> 00:51:11.070]
Ever seen that in commercial? No, you never saw that for the Jack Lillian juicer. Sorry, and his wife is on there and that cross-eyed vixies on

[00:51:11.070 --> 00:51:18.430]
Just nauseating with the much too much lipstick on and he's like feeble. He's standing there in his spandex outfit and like mommy

[00:51:18.430 --> 00:51:22.610]
Mommy, you know like yeah, yeah, and he starts pretending he's drinking the glass of juice

[00:51:22.610 --> 00:51:26.010]
They like puts it to his lips and starts shaking so much mommy's better put the glass down

[00:51:26.010 --> 00:51:32.570]
He he just turned 148 Jack Lillian. He's a miracle over a modern science the 700 Club host feed is recounted on the website of his

[00:51:32.570 --> 00:51:34.530]
Christian Broadcasting Network in Virginia Beach

[00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:40.370]
But sports experts question the assertion in recent weeks with one noting that the leg press record for football players at FSU

[00:51:40.370 --> 00:51:42.870]
is 665 pounds less a

[00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:48.510]
Spokeswoman recently released a photo she said showed Robertson leg pressing two thousand pounds on February 1st

[00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:54.470]
2003 Robertson at surgery to move a cancerous prostate gland later that month and turn 73 that March

[00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:59.070]
I wonder why the Lord spoke him, you know, he's a man of God. I did at one time one rep

[00:51:59.070 --> 00:52:03.230]
But I had built up for to it for about three years Robertson insisted on Wednesday and telephone interview with a amp

[00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:06.490]
The first time he spoke with a reporter since they like press bruhaha

[00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:10.290]
Robertson said his doctor encouraged him to leg press weights to strengthen his bad knees

[00:52:10.290 --> 00:52:13.530]
Well, if he's a man of the law, why you just ask God to heal his knees?

[00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:17.990]
Of course he earned his aim for it. Well, well, what's his name? Benny Hina? Hina Hina Huna?

[00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:23.330]
Benny Hina he said he did the two thousand pound lift on an incline leg press with a machines break on which means

[00:52:23.330 --> 00:52:26.170]
He didn't have to lift the weight the whole way when the professionals do it

[00:52:26.170 --> 00:52:28.410]
They take the break off let the weight come all the way down

[00:52:28.410 --> 00:52:31.770]
And if you don't have a lot of help you've got a wolf swag on sitting on your hips. I didn't do that

[00:52:31.770 --> 00:52:36.610]
He said oh such a liar such a neurotic nut job and all these old ladies are sending them all their money

[00:52:36.610 --> 00:52:42.490]
You know all their dead husbands money. Yeah, and old man without any ease can push that much weight right

[00:52:43.110 --> 00:52:46.590]
Good Johnny Miss Molly now he wouldn't lie to us to understand that in fact

[00:52:46.590 --> 00:52:50.690]
I wouldn't be surprised if we send him down to Venezuela knock off Hugo Chavez he he demand

[00:52:51.110 --> 00:52:54.310]
In fact, wouldn't you like to see him kickboxing with Hugo Chavez when every ring?

[00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:59.290]
I know who to put my money. I think even Pat Marina might come back to make that movie look how many votes we've got on a pull right now

[00:52:59.290 --> 00:53:01.630]
Oh my god

[00:53:03.010 --> 00:53:03.910]

[00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:37.250]

That's right all the people who manufacture ice cream and candy they all be in prison

[00:53:41.130 --> 00:53:45.030]
And let's make it illegal to be fat, you know, you know because it's unhealthy and it'll kill you

Because we got no women and flag-boarding five out of 673 we better get over that 800 mark by the by noon

[00:53:58.910 --> 00:54:03.210]
Just just to be on the safe side. I think we got it made. I think we get a little bit nervous prematurely

[00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:06.350]
14 past 11. Oh, forget we got guilty

It says there was a general on CNN this morning. So they cleaned up Al Zarkare and look at the way this is spelled

[00:58:02.350 --> 00:58:04.710]
Al Zarkare cowie before they photographed him

[00:58:27.570 --> 00:58:31.790]
And the Verizon singular right outside. I got a huge pile just a gigantic pile

[00:58:31.790 --> 00:58:35.770]
Don't know it was that Saudi guy to threaten to blow off a Delta Airlines flight because he was upset

[00:58:35.770 --> 00:58:39.070]
He was a nod to job as an interpreter for US military in Iraq. See that guy

[00:58:39.490 --> 00:58:39.890]
No

[00:58:40.370 --> 00:58:44.070]
Opponents of Washington state new case of a rights law failed to submit enough voter signatures

[00:58:44.070 --> 00:58:49.750]
This week to force to stay wide ballot on the issue this fall the anti-gay biggest failed in Washington state

[00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:54.570]
Office to report Lewis calls the Iraq war illegal and refuses the order to go he will not go

[00:58:55.070 --> 00:58:59.210]
Got all kinds of really good stuff here in this pile of two bad amount of waste my time reading it

[00:58:59.210 --> 00:59:02.010]
Got a story about how bad do you have to go at some schools?

[00:59:02.010 --> 00:59:03.610]
It's bathroom breaks versus grades

[00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:08.150]
You only you can only go and now they tell you it's time to go now when nature tells you it's time to go

[00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:14.430]
So just you know drop drop whatever it is in your pants one two and three right right it's way to do it

[00:59:14.970 --> 00:59:18.050]
Five six seven this is my last call for calls non-vote of my music

[00:59:18.050 --> 00:59:19.810]
That'll be part of my new strategy on the show

[00:59:19.810 --> 00:59:24.790]
Because I think that reading all these stupid bedtime stories is killing the show between that and that stupid crossover

[00:59:25.630 --> 00:59:27.630]
You know when we first came to this radio station

[00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:30.810]
I want you to stop and think about this and here it is eight and a half years later

[00:59:30.810 --> 00:59:35.050]
And it isn't any different than it was then all they had on the air was sports. That's all it was right

[00:59:35.050 --> 00:59:39.030]
They hadn't they didn't have that not only didn't not have the foggiest idea of what we do on the show

[00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:41.270]
They also resented and hated it like toys

[00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:41.670]
That's right

[00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:47.070]
And for the first time you finally unloaded them yesterday the real truth about before even when it started on the air

[00:59:47.070 --> 00:59:48.690]
What you do all about that?

[00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:54.210]
What just forgot I'm old all the bus in the building what hey? I forgot because I sure tell unloaded it

[00:59:54.210 --> 00:59:57.790]
You know back then yeah, all they talked about oh my god

[00:59:57.790 --> 01:00:00.410]
He doesn't do sports at all fact. We don't need him on a station

[01:00:00.410 --> 01:00:04.890]
But my boy's gonna kill us and we got all a great Chris more on air and the book yeah, yeah

[01:00:04.890 --> 01:00:08.070]
We got all this one see one thing about us man if we like bail out of here right now

[01:00:08.070 --> 01:00:10.730]
At least then they could have ones and twos all day long really be consistent

[01:00:10.730 --> 01:00:13.910]
That's a one thing the ingredient lacking on this radio station now is consistency

[01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:17.690]
They could have one and two shares all day long like they did before right

[01:00:17.690 --> 01:00:20.350]
That's right like before we invaded their territory

[01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:24.630]
So they haven't got a freaking clue what is we do on this show and the idea that they're like make a oh

[01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:27.670]
I just make up stories yeah just leave us alone okay

[01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:31.370]
We don't have any problem between ten and two and what is that what I always said mm-hmm

[01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:37.630]
Just like an iod the same philosophy man mess with success if it ain't broken fix it if it ain't broke mess with it

[01:00:37.630 --> 01:00:42.690]
Just like Greg Reed did there it broke the egg what I tell you about that Humpty Dumpty syndrome break the egg

[01:00:42.690 --> 01:00:46.770]
He picked it up and dropped it in this mess into a million little pieces and now oh gee. What do we do?

[01:00:47.470 --> 01:00:49.290]
Yeah, I don't know don't ask me

[01:00:49.290 --> 01:00:53.630]
That was really something when our fearless leader says to me well we have a plan but what would you do?

[01:00:54.830 --> 01:00:58.770]
I think Harry Carrie might have the answer. I'm not talking about the baseball announcer. He's dead

[01:00:58.770 --> 01:01:01.950]
I'm talking about the Japanese. I'm talking about committing sausages

[01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:04.990]

[01:11:30.490 --> 01:11:33.150]
And home of Skipper's Table, uh, Buffet.

[01:11:33.150 --> 01:11:36.570]
And Michael Mallowey, 51 of St. Joseph Parish in May be.

[01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:38.670]
I lost all their lengthy appeals to the Vatican there.

[01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:39.610]
Stisie said Monday.

[01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:41.350]
Coney is no longer a priest.

[01:11:41.470 --> 01:11:47.890]
Rob Borges and Mallowey officially remain clerics but can't participate in the ministry or represent themselves publicly as priests of Detroit News says.

[01:11:48.190 --> 01:11:51.630]
In other words, they can't wear that collar, you know, that little white tab and the Catholic stop them.

[01:11:52.130 --> 01:11:54.790]
It's frustrating for everyone that these cases have taken so long.

[01:11:54.790 --> 01:11:59.210]
So, a court of appeals judge Michael Talbot, who wears an Archdiocese board that oversees the protection of children.

[01:11:59.210 --> 01:12:02.430]
Oh, yeah. And our Stisie's board that oversees the protection of children.

[01:12:02.710 --> 01:12:04.510]
Right. Oh my God.

[01:12:05.050 --> 01:12:08.190]
It's been frustrating for those who have been, I wonder if Michael Jackson serves on that board.

[01:12:08.670 --> 01:12:11.810]
It's been frustrating for those who have been accused because they wanted to know the answers.

[01:12:11.810 --> 01:12:15.170]
It's been especially frustrating for victims of abuse he told the Detroit Free Press.

[01:12:15.690 --> 01:12:20.530]
The three men had defended themselves for years against the charges, which all involved allegations of sexual misconduct.

[01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:21.870]
Did I say against the charges?

[01:12:23.190 --> 01:12:24.950]
The newspapers said they couldn't reach them for comment.

[01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:28.190]
Thus far, 18 cases have been completed by the Vatican since 2004.

[01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:32.650]
With only one priest being returned to the ministry, the Archdiocese awaits ward on the 6th of the case.

[01:12:32.850 --> 01:12:34.330]
Oh, there are other cases already.

[01:12:35.290 --> 01:12:38.250]
All these silly men running around and dressed as just waiting to molest your children.

[01:12:38.410 --> 01:12:41.350]
All your people keep running, schlepping air every week and putting the money into play.

[01:12:41.730 --> 01:12:43.070]
And you're rubbing your rosary beads.

[01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:45.010]
And you're doing a hell of Mary's.

[01:12:45.610 --> 01:12:47.430]
I think everybody ought to go see the Omen.

[01:12:47.770 --> 01:12:49.130]
Even they go see the Noon.

[01:12:49.710 --> 01:12:57.910]
Because it's a really good reminder of all the trappings, the trappings and the trappings of this ridiculous corrupt institute like that stuff.

[01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.650]
What are you talking about?

[01:12:58.970 --> 01:12:59.790]
That's what I'm saying.

[01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:01.550]
Man, more of a barrier.

[01:13:02.090 --> 01:13:03.830]
In fact, Old King Col was a merriol soul.

[01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:04.630]
But I heard.

[01:13:04.710 --> 01:13:07.730]
Only at least he didn't wear a dress though, like the Pope and the bishops.

[01:13:08.590 --> 01:13:10.850]
And of course, the Swiss guard. That's another story all together.

[01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:13.270]
What do you think the Swiss guard are doing most of the time?

[01:13:13.670 --> 01:13:13.930]
Swishing?

[01:13:14.250 --> 01:13:14.850]
No, the Pope.

[01:13:15.310 --> 01:13:15.310]

[01:13:17.170 --> 01:13:19.110]
745 votes on the poll so far.

[01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:20.290]
I think we've got a shot at it.

[01:13:20.450 --> 01:13:23.050]
We'll get over 800 by the top of the article E's on in.

[01:13:23.310 --> 01:13:24.170]
Well, close to 800.

[01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:26.130]
Which of these issues do you care about most?

[01:13:26.530 --> 01:13:27.730]
The war in Iraq, 191.

[01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:29.710]
The economy, 187.

[01:13:30.690 --> 01:13:31.410]
Education, 95.

[01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:32.810]
Freedom of speech, 81.

[01:13:33.330 --> 01:13:34.630]
Legalizing, pot, 75.

[01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:36.070]
Illegal immigration, 66.

[01:13:36.430 --> 01:13:37.290]
I got another one for a minute.

[01:13:37.690 --> 01:13:38.830]
I hit this poll, 26.

[01:13:39.250 --> 01:13:40.110]
Game marriage, 11.

[01:13:40.290 --> 01:13:41.210]
Only 1.4%.

[01:13:41.210 --> 01:13:42.470]
That's about the same as all the other polls.

[01:13:42.670 --> 01:13:43.390]
A little over 1%.

[01:13:43.390 --> 01:13:44.390]
Maybe a little less.

[01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:45.770]
Abortion writes 7.

[01:13:45.910 --> 01:13:47.290]
And flag burning, 6.

[01:13:47.490 --> 01:13:48.330]
Oh my God.

[01:13:48.670 --> 01:13:51.190]
And even a Hillary who's busy not going to encode a ripping her ass.

[01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:52.390]
Nice going Hillary, but you're an idiot.

[01:13:52.730 --> 01:13:53.730]
Even she's on the bad way.

[01:13:53.890 --> 01:13:58.050]
Oh, let's have an amendment to, if I love burning the flag.

[01:13:58.790 --> 01:14:00.210]
You know something, if I go into a store,

[01:14:00.370 --> 01:14:01.730]
we've been through this a million times before.

[01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:04.290]
If I had by a t-shirt at Keymark,

[01:14:04.770 --> 01:14:07.390]
and I want to take it home and burn it in a waste basket,

[01:14:07.730 --> 01:14:08.430]
that's my business.

[01:14:08.670 --> 01:14:09.390]
Okay, start the party.

[01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.790]
Or in the barbeque.

[01:14:09.790 --> 01:14:10.350]
Or in the barbeque.

[01:14:10.570 --> 01:14:10.690]
Or whatever.

[01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:10.950]
Yeah.

[01:14:10.950 --> 01:14:13.590]
If I want to take an American flag and stick it on a barbeque around

[01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:15.470]
those t-bone sticks, that's my business.

[01:14:15.670 --> 01:14:16.210]
It's my property.

[01:14:16.270 --> 01:14:17.210]
I don't know what it is how I want with it.

[01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:17.650]
That's right.

[01:14:17.950 --> 01:14:21.310]
It is so embarrassingly juvenile and idiotic and pathetic.

[01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:23.230]
It's just like a marijuana laws.

[01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:23.910]
It's the same thing.

[01:14:24.610 --> 01:14:27.330]
America is a society that refuses to grow up.

[01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:29.250]
It just absolutely don't want to grow up.

[01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:31.770]
And of course, we're trying to export that same kind of juvenile.

[01:14:31.790 --> 01:14:36.430]
Just like the thing warning the Germans about prostitution in Germany during the World Cup.

[01:14:36.750 --> 01:14:37.850]
Mine, you're all business, okay?

[01:14:38.050 --> 01:14:40.070]
Just like always, we're warning the Dutch about their drug laws.

[01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:41.850]
Mine, your own thinking business.

[01:14:42.190 --> 01:14:45.890]
Trying not just to export, but to impose your values on the rest of the world.

[01:14:46.030 --> 01:14:47.890]
They wonder why the world hates America like poison?

[01:14:48.370 --> 01:14:51.230]
You're getting pretty sick and tired of this dip tutorial deal that's going on.

[01:14:51.650 --> 01:14:52.670]
Oh, I have one more for the poll.

[01:14:53.190 --> 01:14:53.630]
Now I'm serious.

[01:14:54.050 --> 01:14:54.290]
All right.

[01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:55.790]
The survival of QAM.

[01:14:56.810 --> 01:14:59.130]
Don't you think many of our listeners are very concerned about that?

[01:14:59.630 --> 01:15:00.570]
Yeah, we're adding it right now.

[01:15:00.850 --> 01:15:02.270]
And we need to suggest that that's a hell of a lot.

[01:15:02.450 --> 01:15:04.510]
A much greater priority than a Fag marriages.

[01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:07.110]
This is Neil Rudder.

[01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:07.750]
You failed.

[01:15:08.330 --> 01:15:11.270]
This is 5.16 QAM.

[01:15:12.750 --> 01:15:14.170]
Drudge back in?

[01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:15.290]
Huh?

[01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:27.590]
Early in the morning, wait before Christmas time.

[01:15:28.150 --> 01:15:31.830]
Thousands of labels are trying to cross the line.

[01:15:32.830 --> 01:15:34.230]
Send true to the border.

[01:15:34.590 --> 01:15:36.430]
Who won't take no breath?

[01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:38.830]
Trick or a thing is itchy.

[01:15:39.390 --> 01:15:40.850]
Just got back from the wreck.

[01:15:41.790 --> 01:15:43.270]
Yeah, I'm the border.

[01:15:44.210 --> 01:15:45.570]
Near the real brand.

[01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:47.770]
Wishing the guards man a weight.

[01:15:48.150 --> 01:15:50.170]
Trying to be blind and the same.

[01:15:50.730 --> 01:15:52.550]
They won't need body armor.

[01:15:53.150 --> 01:15:54.850]
And they can even get a tan.

[01:15:55.810 --> 01:15:57.310]
Won't see no car farmers.

[01:15:57.710 --> 01:15:59.430]
Just thinking I'm a little van.

[01:15:59.430 --> 01:16:01.890]
There's no one named Mohammed.

[01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:04.270]
But a lot of them named Ron.

[01:16:04.650 --> 01:16:06.510]
And they don't want to kill you.

[01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:08.690]
Just want to know your love.

[01:16:09.730 --> 01:16:11.110]
Down on the border.

[01:16:12.010 --> 01:16:12.970]
All the USA.

[01:16:13.670 --> 01:16:15.450]
Wishing the guards man a try.

[01:16:16.010 --> 01:16:17.770]
To keep the Mexicans away.

[01:16:18.810 --> 01:16:19.990]
Down on the border.

[01:16:20.130 --> 01:16:24.070]
I think I just came up with a perfect solution for the final solution.

[01:16:24.150 --> 01:16:27.390]
But the perfect solution for this all, at least in probably all those companies over there

[01:16:27.390 --> 01:16:30.530]
and all the Jews and the Arabs and the Guaymen and everybody hates each other.

[01:16:30.730 --> 01:16:31.950]
I think we're just going to have to nuke them.

[01:16:32.090 --> 01:16:32.350]
Okay.

[01:16:32.990 --> 01:16:33.530]
Flatten them.

[01:16:33.690 --> 01:16:34.530]
The fight over that.

[01:16:34.910 --> 01:16:35.130]
Right.

[01:16:35.310 --> 01:16:35.710]
That's correct.

[01:16:36.270 --> 01:16:40.750]
And of course there's always a few innocent pan and he has bystanders just like this Alzar Calibombing this morning.

[01:16:40.750 --> 01:16:41.930]
There were some like women and children.

[01:16:42.090 --> 01:16:43.450]
But you know, getting away.

[01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:45.730]
You know, if they were smart, they wouldn't have gotten away in the first place.

[01:16:45.850 --> 01:16:46.590]
They should have attacked us.

[01:16:46.850 --> 01:16:47.330]
That is correct.

[01:16:47.710 --> 01:16:49.830]
So there's always some collateral damages they call it.

[01:16:49.950 --> 01:16:51.210]
But it's one of those things.

[01:16:51.390 --> 01:16:52.770]
The price you have to pay for freedom man.

[01:16:52.930 --> 01:16:53.550]
Freedom's on a march.

[01:16:54.130 --> 01:16:56.810]
And so I'm thinking that all of those middle eastern countries just flatten the man.

[01:16:56.810 --> 01:16:58.970]
Just eviscerate them and leave us alone.

[01:16:59.190 --> 01:16:59.970]
That's how we want this.

[01:17:00.050 --> 01:17:00.750]
Leave us to hell all alone.

[01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:02.450]
Leave us out of all your battles man.

[01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:06.910]
Over all your nonsense and your mumbo jumbo and your seafood gumbo and all this other crap.

[01:17:07.410 --> 01:17:08.610]
Just leave people be man.

[01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:09.310]
They can't do it.

[01:17:09.490 --> 01:17:10.930]
They can't do it because they're crazy people.

[01:17:11.250 --> 01:17:14.110]
And like I've told you for a very long time, the religious people are all.

[01:17:14.730 --> 01:17:15.810]
It's just a matter of degree.

[01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:18.530]
And of course so many of you would say, oh not me.

[01:17:18.710 --> 01:17:19.350]
I mean, yeah, you are.

[01:17:19.690 --> 01:17:24.930]
If you're one of the God squad, no matter what your particular brand of poison is, it's still poison.

[01:17:25.670 --> 01:17:28.250]
It's still grotesque and it's still ridiculous.

[01:17:28.970 --> 01:17:30.250]
It's man-made nonsense.

[01:17:30.510 --> 01:17:31.930]
But really just some spiritual.

[01:17:32.170 --> 01:17:33.110]
Oh yeah, spiritual.

[01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:34.110]
Remember I was talking about that.

[01:17:34.170 --> 01:17:34.870]
Now what does that mean?

[01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:36.010]
Does anybody have any idea?

[01:17:36.150 --> 01:17:36.270]
No.

[01:17:36.350 --> 01:17:38.130]
No, it's just another stupid word that people want.

[01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:39.070]
They have a spiritual.

[01:17:39.370 --> 01:17:41.150]
I'm in touch with the outer space.

[01:17:41.210 --> 01:17:42.310]
I'm in touch with the Uranus.

[01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:42.490]
Yeah.

[01:17:42.730 --> 01:17:43.490]
I'll quit touching it.

[01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:49.930]
A major wrestling match in Congress over control of the internet features some strange tag teams, rockers and evangelicals,

[01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:56.840]
versus phone companies and the Bells usually biggest adversary, cable TV companies, rockers and evangelists.

[01:17:57.100 --> 01:17:58.220]
And we've got that Christian rock.

[01:17:59.000 --> 01:17:59.180]
Right.

[01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:01.220]
I mean, that's talking about Senator Garfunco.

[01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:01.840]
I am a rocker.

[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:02.560]
What are you eating now?

[01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:03.020]
Pizza.

[01:18:03.340 --> 01:18:04.300]
Pizza from Antonio.

[01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:04.960]
Oh, but me.

[01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:06.200]
You know what?

[01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:07.700]
Oh, thanks a lot, Brad.

[01:18:08.140 --> 01:18:09.980]
I may not be there, but I can smell it from here.

[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:11.940]
He's got a good, a good hot.

[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:12.780]
Oh, that's hot.

[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:12.920]
Mmm.

[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:15.020]
The Josh has a slice on each hand.

[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:16.080]
How about pizza?

[01:18:16.260 --> 01:18:16.780]
Yeah, that's true.

[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:26.120]
The most far reaching telecommunications bill in a decade has its main purpose, making it easier for phone companies to compete against cable companies, offering the equivalent of cable TV,

[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:31.440]
and streamline the approval process for both that promise to consumers as lower prices and more choices.

[01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:34.780]
But the biggest controversy is a different issue, so-called net neutrality.

[01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:41.280]
The idea is that all websites should get the same treatment from cable and phone companies for use of their broadband, high-speed internet lines.

[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:52.720]
The rockers and evangelists joined by Microsoft Google and Yahoo, feared that telephone and cable companies who control the internet highway will put their own products in the fast lanes, and relegate those in line to pay premium fees to poor quality and slower service.

[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:54.560]
We want to be in the fast lane, don't you?

[01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:55.200]
Oh, yeah.

[01:18:55.580 --> 01:18:57.840]
Like a Superman, he wanted to be in the lowest lane.

[01:18:58.180 --> 01:19:00.000]
In their corner are the Christian Coalition.

[01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:01.300]
Oh, my goodness.

[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:09.440]
National religious broadcasters and gun owners of America, as well as move on.org and recording artist Aurem, the Indigo Girls and Moby.

[01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:10.240]
Oh, my God.

[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:10.740]
Too fairy.

[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:13.420]
If Congress guts Amcere Glad and Moby and Gay.

[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:23.820]
If Congress guts net neutrality, independent music and new sites will be choked off, consumer choice will be limited, and the internet will become a private toll road auctioned off by companies like AT&T and Moby said, and a statement of a recent capital hill event.

[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:35.520]
Both the House and Senate bill sponsored by the chairman of their two commerce committees, respectively representative Joe Barton Republican Texas and Senator the Unctions Ted Stevens of Republican Alaska, addressed net neutrality, but in language that critics say is too weak to prevent discrimination.

[01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:47.160]
Simply put, net neutrality legislation endangers both the future of video choice and the accelerated broadband investment has just beginning to gain traction for rising executive vice president Tom Taukey, test of that at a recent Senate hearing.

[01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:52.740]
So here once again, you know, we're just going to hand it over as a monopoly to a few folks here, we're going to like, probably, yes.

[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:53.660]
We're going to do the wrong thing.

[01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:55.620]
Yeah, we always do the wrong thing.

[01:19:56.740 --> 01:19:58.060]
Now, here's somebody who's doing the right thing.

[01:19:58.180 --> 01:19:59.980]
One thing about this show, man, we love Wendy's.

[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:00.960]
Always have always will.

[01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:01.560]
Right.

[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:08.640]
I just go to Wendy's today and bring home a couple of those onion bacon, whatever those things are without cheese, you know,

[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:10.120]
this weekend, huh?

[01:20:10.540 --> 01:20:11.160]
That's some of this week.

[01:20:11.260 --> 01:20:13.540]
Bring him home and heat him up in the microwave, nuke him a little bit.

[01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:14.600]
Now, of course, throw away bread.

[01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:15.420]
I'll treat the bread.

[01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:16.700]
And of course, who the hell needs the bread?

[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:22.460]
When he got 16 patties and that good stuff, what all kinds of cheese, dripping down on onions and oh, man.

[01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:29.100]
Wendy's international said today it's going to begin frying french fries and breaded chicken items with non-hydrogenated oil,

[01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:32.000]
continuing a shift to offer healthier menu choices.

[01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:39.480]
The country's third largest burger chain said the blend of corn and soy oil has, you know, one of the great cause of all time, one of the most stupid people I've ever heard my life,

[01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:43.100]
was that on Monday that I did, you called about the olive oil and all the carbohydrates.

[01:20:43.220 --> 01:20:43.740]
Right, right.

[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:48.000]
Either way, you were trying to be a smart ass, which is probable because nobody can be that stupid.

[01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:49.040]
Or you just amor on.

[01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:49.780]
Or you'd be surprised.

[01:20:50.140 --> 01:20:50.740]
Just an idiot.

[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:51.280]
Oh, yeah.

[01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:52.960]
Don't use the olive oil, man.

[01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:53.900]
Just load it with carbs.

[01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:54.860]
Uh, what?

[01:20:55.980 --> 01:21:05.860]
The country's third largest burger chain said the blend of corn and soy oil has zero grams of artery clogging, trans fat per serving, and will cut trans fat in those menu items by 95%.

[01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:07.240]
Wow, I'm going twice.

[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:12.040]
Wendy's will begin using the oil in the 60, 300 restaurants in the US and Canada in August.

[01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:13.420]
I'll wait till August to go.

[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:23.000]
Trans fat raises bad cholesterol and lowers good cholesterol, eating just five grams of trans fat a day, raises the risk of heart disease by 25% research of.

[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:34.260]
Well, I also saw a story, but I can't find it on the web that Hispanics react much better to high if the Hispanics with high blood pressure react much better to hypertension drugs than non-Hispanics.

[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:34.540]
Okay.

[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:37.340]
Today I'm going to think that some of you people get so emotional and hysterical, you know.

[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:39.460]
Papa, couple of pills, man.

[01:21:39.540 --> 01:21:39.980]
Calm down.

[01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:42.540]
I'm going to trouble now.

[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.380]
The Russian's got some oxies for it.

[01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:46.080]
Take away the pain in Spain.

[01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:51.760]
The new oil will reduce trans fat to zero grams for Wendy's cheek and sandwiches, chicken nuggets and chicken strips.

[01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:56.000]
A large order of fries will go from seven grams to zero point five grams.

[01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:58.480]
That's kind of like our numbers from seven to zero point five.

[01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:02.860]
While in order of fries in the kids menu will have zero grams, the big O.

[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:06.160]
Wendy's based at the Columbia suburb of Dublin, Ohio.

[01:22:06.340 --> 01:22:07.260]
I never heard of Dublin, Ohio.

[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:08.020]
Nope.

[01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:15.000]
Said it's working to further reduce trans fats and fries that occurs when suppliers partially cook the potatoes before shipping them to restaurants.

[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.580]
What potatoes you can't have that anyway.

[01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:17.660]
I heard of Dublin over.

[01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:18.520]
Plus I don't want them.

[01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:22.880]
Fries and sandwiches cooked in the new oil taste and cost exactly the same as Toronto said.

[01:22:23.260 --> 01:22:24.520]
I wonder if he's kind of Eric Astrada.

[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:25.160]
Hey Eric.

[01:22:25.300 --> 01:22:25.720]
You're fair.

[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:30.700]
Wendy's also anter trained workers in how to use the new oil which has a shorter shelf life than the old one.

[01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:32.320]
Oh, we don't want them using no bad oil, man.

[01:22:32.660 --> 01:22:33.360]
Well, you're at it.

[01:22:33.380 --> 01:22:35.220]
Train them to actually cook the fries and serve them hot.

[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:43.580]
Wendy's has been working on the new oil for two years and testing it for a year at 370 restaurants in Florida, North Carolina, West Virginia and Ontario.

[01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:49.200]
McDonald's corp plugs four years ago to switch to oil that would cut in half the level of trans fats and the top-telling chains fries.

[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:56.160]
However, Chief Executive Jim Scherner said in April that the Oprah Kilroy base company was still testing the oil and didn't know when they'd make the chains.

[01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:59.360]
They said maybe from now until next circus.

[01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:07.600]
Earlier this year Wendy's cut all trans fat from salad dressings and last year the chains started offering margarine with zero grams of fat for serving for baked potatoes.

[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:08.560]
Margarine.

[01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:10.040]
Thought margarine's bad for you.

[01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:10.340]
That is.

[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:10.940]
Oh.

[01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:12.960]
In 2000, it skipped the baked potato.

[01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:17.940]
Okay, because the baked potatoes, the deadly nightshades, man, the deadly nightshades, whatever that means.

[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:18.480]
Ever see that?

[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:19.040]
Yes.

[01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:20.240]
Potatoes.

[01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:24.180]
In 2004, in fact, don't potatoes have like a chew in them, tuber?

[01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:26.480]
If you want to, you can tell.

[01:23:26.660 --> 01:23:28.560]
I'm opening up a chain called tubers for goobers.

[01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:37.560]
In 2004, I began offering combo meal choices that allowed customers to pick chili, a baked potato or a side salad instead of fries, an offering milk and a fruit for substituting kids' meals.

[01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:39.040]
Do not serve your kids milk.

[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:40.460]
Okay, unless you're a crazy person.

[01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:43.020]
There are no animals that drink the milk of other animals.

[01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:44.640]
Okay, just it doesn't happen in nature.

[01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:47.560]
It's just unnatural, unclean, unclean.

[01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:48.420]
My God.

[01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:49.920]
What are you people thinking about?

[01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:51.700]
Next thing you'll be eating sugar.

[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:55.560]
I'm off to sugar man today and yesterday and Tuesday.

[01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:57.400]
My third day off sugar.

[01:23:57.720 --> 01:23:58.140]
Aren't you proud?

[01:23:58.500 --> 01:23:58.840]
Very.

[01:23:59.160 --> 01:23:59.880]
I'm wearing it proudly.

[01:24:00.100 --> 01:24:01.520]
I'm my icy sleeve.

[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.620]
And you know why, present on a tonight's game?

[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:05.540]
786 votes.

[01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:07.900]
I told you we'd be closing it on 800 by the new hour.

[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:09.620]
And I think we'll be okay.

[01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:10.520]
I'm not really sure though.

[01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:12.620]
I'm a little like a little crap on this one.

[01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:15.520]
By the way, that is coming up after the break of your entire unsensitive crap.

[01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:16.440]
All right.

[01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:18.540]
This is meal Roger.

[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:22.400]
This is 5.16 Q.A.

[01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:26.180]
Where are it beaded?

[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:29.100]
Well, the one hour on WQA.

[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:34.960]
Oh, look who that is.

[01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:37.240]
Everybody look who new that is.

[01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:39.520]
Nobody look who new that is.

[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:41.340]
That is when he wins.

[01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:43.700]
He's a racing winner.

[01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:46.160]
Race around in the start that is.

[01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:48.540]
The race driver that never wins.

[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:50.300]
That is when he wins.

[01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:54.020]
Now she hear all you means.

[01:24:54.660 --> 01:24:56.380]
They call me Mr. Reef.

[01:24:56.380 --> 01:24:58.440]
Oh, one day too not win, my race.

[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:00.680]
In my rocket speediest.

[01:25:01.020 --> 01:25:02.820]
Oh, where are you, baby?

[01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:05.140]
You showed us that today.

[01:25:05.380 --> 01:25:07.440]
Oh, how history of the few wins this day.

[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:08.500]
Oh, where are you, baby?

[01:25:08.700 --> 01:25:09.600]
It's not a big place.

[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:11.980]
Well, you hurt yourself so it's on a plane.

[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:13.040]
Well, get that on him.

[01:25:13.340 --> 01:25:14.020]
How's the day?

[01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:16.420]
Oh, it ain't gonna take that chance.

[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:18.380]
Not if you keep calling it last.

[01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:20.560]
That's why you don't go out with me.

[01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:21.820]
You ain't too slow.

[01:25:21.980 --> 01:25:22.760]
You can't compete.

[01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:23.660]
Where are you, baby?

[01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:25.020]
Slow on the street.

[01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:27.600]
But I show be fast on my feet.

[01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:13.080]
I'm gonna go out with you.

[01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:16.040]
I'm gonna go out with you.

[01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:16.760]
I'm gonna go out with you.

[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:17.400]
I'm gonna go out with you.

[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:17.400]

[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:18.640]
I'm gonna go out with you.

[01:26:18.660 --> 01:26:19.280]
I'm gonna go out with you.

[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:20.760]
I'm gonna go out with you.

[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:21.560]
I'm gonna go out with you.

[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:22.140]
I'm gonna go out with you.

[01:26:22.140 --> 01:26:22.280]
I'm gonna go out with you.

[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:24.300]
I'm gonna go out with you.

[01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:24.300]

[01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:25.000]
I'm gonna go out with you.

[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:26.540]
Jason Grimsley.

[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:27.680]
You know who that is, Josh?

[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:29.480]
I've heard of that name.

[01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:35.220]
Jason Grimsley, who was cut by the Arizona Diamondbacks yesterday after admitting the steroid use.

[01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:36.160]
Oh, yeah, yeah.

[01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:39.900]
See, Zommy, you noticed the tone in his voice when they wanted to know why he's negative about this?

[01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:41.160]
What is it all about now?

[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:43.160]
Because this is a story about his hero.

[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:45.680]
He's only got one hero.

[01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:47.400]
What are you talking about?

[01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:48.200]
You're a hero.

[01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:50.980]
What do you mean what I'd be talking about?

[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:51.440]
Ron Jeremy.

[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:53.560]
Ron Jeremy about his hero.

[01:26:54.280 --> 01:27:03.320]
Jason Grimsley was cut by the Diamondbacks yesterday after admitting the steroid use was only a pawn in federal agent's attempt to gather evidence against very bonds, Grimsley's attorney told the Arizona Republic newspaper.

[01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:06.200]
They're after very zass, man, and boy, it's a big target.

[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:17.520]
According to Grimsley's lawyer Edward F. Novak, the feds tried to pressure Grimsley into wearing a listening device to lure other players into confidential conversations all in an effort to find evidence against bonds of steroid use.

[01:27:17.780 --> 01:27:19.200]
Now why do they got a single poor bury out?

[01:27:19.660 --> 01:27:21.580]
Even I think that's a little bit over the top, you know?

[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:22.060]
Good point.

[01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:25.040]
Oh, I'm so shocked you said that.

[01:27:25.380 --> 01:27:28.080]
It was a specific effort to target bonds, though, Vak told the Republic.

[01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:30.840]
We were told that Jason's cooperation was necessary to their case.

[01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:33.240]
Come on, leave poor bury alone, okay?

[01:27:33.340 --> 01:27:35.220]
Just because he's a hard ass and got a crappy attitude.

[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:38.300]
13 federal agent searched his home in Scottsdale, Arizona.

[01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:39.880]
That is Jason Grimsley.

[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:42.660]
For six hours to do that, but they wouldn't reveal what they found.

[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:51.160]
Investigators who cracked the bellcoast steroid scandal in San Francisco said Grimsley initially cooperate in the probe, but withdrew his assistance in April prompting the search on Tuesday.

[01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:54.280]
It's red on my bed and Randy wasn't even sitting there.

[01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:56.260]
Look at that. It's still green.

[01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:58.000]
Let me try to refresh it.

[01:27:58.280 --> 01:27:59.760]
Yeah, refresh it. You lazy, baby.

[01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:01.120]
Oh, no, it's a turned green again.

[01:28:01.260 --> 01:28:02.000]
Oh, no, you missed the red.

[01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:04.360]
I got two dropouts, but it's still green.

[01:28:04.660 --> 01:28:05.960]
No, it was red now. It's back to green.

[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.240]
So you missed all the good stuff and be green.

[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:07.560]
They're green.

[01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:09.280]
I blinked when it turned back to green.

[01:28:09.660 --> 01:28:10.400]
But that was real quick.

[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:12.260]
I think probably because I opened up a big mouth on that.

[01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:15.280]
All of a sudden somebody went, oh, it better on messed that, you know?

[01:28:15.620 --> 01:28:18.380]
We understand you're trying to sabotage the show, Joyce and Clarence.

[01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:19.760]
We know what's going on behind the scenes.

[01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:20.800]
You're not fooling anybody.

[01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:23.800]
In fact, you know what I think they're devious kinds of, they're like your fat ass governor.

[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:24.600]
They got devious kinds.

[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:26.160]
You know what I think their friends really are?

[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:26.620]
I give up.

[01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:27.900]
And they're working really well too.

[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:31.640]
I think what they want like to do, especially before the summer schedule is coming up, you know?

[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:34.400]
They'd like to get me pissed off and up to get me to take a walk.

[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:35.560]
I really believe that now.

[01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:35.940]

[01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:40.200]
No, that was never that conspiratorial mind had before.

[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:42.740]
I never give these people enough credit to be thinking that way.

[01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:44.020]
But that's got to be it.

[01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:45.260]
It's got to be that.

[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:46.280]
Think about it.

[01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:47.860]
Because first of all, we don't do sports.

[01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:51.640]
I mean, especially at a time when everybody's talking about, you know, we're just peeing on their parade, man.

[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:53.280]
It's four hours they could be talking a lot about.

[01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:54.680]
And then that too.

[01:28:55.360 --> 01:29:05.660]
Who now lots of you about Abu Musab, all of us are Kawi and about Ann Colter and Hillary Clinton and Indecency Bill's in a Congress and a bunch of great calls that we got.

[01:29:05.780 --> 01:29:07.380]
Who aren't talking about that?

[01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:09.100]
By the way, I heard that.

[01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:10.300]
So what's his name in plan tonight?

[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:10.840]
Dwayne Wade.

[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:12.280]
I heard it.

[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:13.100]
Through the grapevine.

[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:13.560]
Who?

[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:14.800]
Ben Harper told me.

[01:29:15.140 --> 01:29:16.240]
Said Dwayne Wade ain't planned.

[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:19.400]
Or Shaq and Pat Rattie's got a hair appointment.

[01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:21.260]
850 votes on the pool.

[01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:23.680]
I think we get to 900 by the top of the air we got it made in the shade.

[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:26.000]
And that should be pretty easy where we got 52 minutes.

[01:29:26.180 --> 01:29:26.520]
Oh, yeah.

[01:29:26.900 --> 01:29:28.260]
I think we got this baby lick.

[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:30.920]
And once we get to 1000 votes, I'm bailing out because it looks pretty nice.

[01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:31.580]
It looks like sunny.

[01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:34.820]
You know, I'm not going to be sad all day like yesterday fighting to get my money back.

[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:36.940]
I wish you'd stop telling me to play that damn dollar.

[01:29:36.940 --> 01:29:37.520]
We'd afford to.

[01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:39.460]
It's a mostly sunny and sunny degrees.

[01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:40.500]
What are these days, it'll pay on.

[01:29:40.660 --> 01:29:42.120]
It's going to be 77 today.

[01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:43.520]
An honor of WABC.

[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:44.280]
77.

[01:29:44.620 --> 01:29:46.460]
It hasn't been brewed by the way with the worst hair piece.

[01:29:46.580 --> 01:29:47.600]
And even what's his name?

[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:48.280]
Dave and boring.

[01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:49.940]
Even a worst hair piece then.

[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:50.580]
Don't go.

[01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:51.320]
You're saying a lot.

[01:29:51.860 --> 01:29:53.120]
Now I wonder what he did with that.

[01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:53.900]
I have a theme.

[01:29:54.340 --> 01:29:57.980]
Remember the days Steve said where the engineer at R&D we were making fun of that horrible wig.

[01:29:58.180 --> 01:30:01.180]
You know, you just finally took it off his head and he did that.

[01:30:01.220 --> 01:30:03.020]
I should have kept that as a souvenir.

[01:30:03.380 --> 01:30:06.260]
I should have kept that for Mo for a spare with the muskrat cutter.

[01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:10.020]
In fact, we did find out that Mo had like he had designer ones.

[01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:11.880]
He had for different, you know, different moods he was in.

[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:13.160]
That is how he was all this and more.

[01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:14.420]
You're not making that up.

[01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:14.900]
No, I know that.

[01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:16.860]
And he had like your Sunday go to meetin best wig.

[01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:20.380]
And that is every day he's been doing work out in the yard.

[01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:21.340]
Maybe he had his fight wig.

[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:23.160]
Scared the crap out of me.

[01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:24.480]
Oh, yeah.

[01:30:25.060 --> 01:30:26.000]
What a fright.

[01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:29.080]
And then of course when he started trying to find those Martians in his pants.

[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:29.840]
Oh, totally, totally.

[01:30:30.260 --> 01:30:30.920]
Man, oh man.

[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:32.780]
You know who his favorite congressman is?

[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:33.760]
I give up.

[01:30:34.100 --> 01:30:35.080]
John Dingell from Michigan.

[01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:37.460]
819 on the pole.

[01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:38.420]
He pang it on that thing.

[01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:41.200]
We want to get to that thousand otherwise you're going to have to do penance for it.

[01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:47.520]
Do not go see the Omen go rent or buy the original Omen with Gregory Peck and Lee Remick.

[01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:50.980]
Tony, there's not, I haven't seen the new one but I've seen the previous one I read about it.

[01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:52.240]
And you just have to be a crazy person.

[01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:55.480]
And by the way, was it, what was her name, the, um, the Manny?

[01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:56.440]
Oh, geez.

[01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:57.020]
The character.

[01:30:57.460 --> 01:30:57.940]
Oh, I don't know.

[01:30:58.220 --> 01:30:59.380]
Wait, it's very important, man.

[01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:01.300]
The one in the original movie was fantastic.

[01:31:01.540 --> 01:31:02.920]
She was like about 80% of the movie.

[01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:03.440]
She was great.

[01:31:03.460 --> 01:31:04.620]
She had that evil look in her eyes.

[01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:05.640]
Lookin'.

[01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:07.020]
Did you google the Omen yet?

[01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:08.620]
I'm on IMDbbbb.

[01:31:08.780 --> 01:31:09.060]
Okay.

[01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:11.040]
Which of these issues do you care about the most?

[01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:16.780]
The War in Iraq 208, the economy 199, education 107, freedom of speech 98.

[01:31:16.780 --> 01:31:17.320]
Remember that?

[01:31:17.660 --> 01:31:18.100]
Oh, yeah.

[01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:18.820]
That went out to window.

[01:31:19.180 --> 01:31:20.360]
Was it this is Velocon?

[01:31:20.660 --> 01:31:20.820]
Who?

[01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:21.760]
The first Veloc.

[01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:22.620]
That's the longest reason.

[01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:23.380]

to show up, kind of like asking Charles Hesseman if he wouldn't have shown up in

[01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:56.440]
Columbine at the right or in Flint. I didn't fly planes into the building. I don't

[01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:59.160]
know what you're talking about. Said, quote, or is she pause from signing copies of

[01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:03.160]
Godless, the Church of Liberalism, published Monday. It was number one. Amazon.com

[01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:05.980]
is best over the yesterday. Isn't that said? And the most she claims liberals

[01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:10.180]
so visually use women with personal tragedies to advance political ends. Her

[01:33:10.180 --> 01:33:13.500]
remarks were aimed in particular to group of New Jersey widows who quote her said

[01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:16.600]
use their grief to attack President Bush and support Bush's one-time presidential

[01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:21.320]
rival, Democrat John Kerry. Meanwhile, speaking of macho, oh, she is so me

[01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:24.580]
as that Anne Colter. My God. He should have been that list of a 40-pound

[01:33:24.580 --> 01:33:27.040]
weaklings. How to see this picture in the sea.

[01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:30.660]
Well, that's right, baby. Oh, brother, what is it? It's alive.

[01:33:31.380 --> 01:33:34.940]
Hillary Clinton lashed out at Anne Colter for a vicious mean-spirited attack on a

[01:33:34.940 --> 01:33:37.980]
group of votes outspoken nine-level widows, whom the right wing television

[01:33:37.980 --> 01:33:41.860]
punter described herself obsessed and enjoying their husband's deaths. Clinton

[01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:44.920]
who has felt Colter's wrath over the years, responded angrily on Wednesday.

[01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:48.380]
Perhaps her book should have been called Heartless, the senator said instead of

[01:33:48.380 --> 01:33:51.680]
Godless, Heartless. I know a lot of the widows and family members who lost loved

[01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:55.480]
ones on 11. They never wanted to be a member of a group that's defined by the

[01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:58.380]
tragedy of what happened. The New York Democratic Ratton former First Lady

[01:33:58.380 --> 01:34:01.680]
said she found it unimaginable that anyone in the public eye could launch a

[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:04.880]
vicious mean-spirited attack on people whom I've known over the last four and a

[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:07.860]
half years to be concerned deeply about the safety and security of our country.

[01:34:08.380 --> 01:34:11.380]

[01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:14.040]

And they're talking about why you know in New York City where there's a much higher

[01:37:09.620 --> 01:37:12.920]
level and then rest of the country all the time. Anyway, of course that's why I pushed

[01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:16.360]
this because big chunks of these funding, the Homeland Security funding for New York

[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:17.540]
Washington. I mean who are they?

[01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:18.020]

[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:41.600]
around a little bit? Oh my god. It's just I think it's because they have that kind of

[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:46.060]
like brown and dark browns. Well different shades of brown but like skin you know and when

[01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:49.720]
you have a red hair piece on it's like kind of like a puse. I don't know what that is.

[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:54.880]

[01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:58.360]
we don't feel very safe I'll tell you why. The US House of Representatives and thank

[01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:01.900]
God that Norma Kent alerted me to this yesterday because I had no idea that this was going

[01:38:01.900 --> 01:38:07.260]
on. Did you? No I hadn't heard that. Now we're still having a loop. The US House of Representatives

[01:38:07.260 --> 01:38:11.580]
approved the Broadcast Decenty Enforcement Act of 2005 yesterday by a vote of do you see

[01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:17.400]
what the vote was? No. 379 to 35. How about that? See we haven't got a prayer where we

[01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:20.740]
got a Chinaman's chance in Hill. The Senate has already approved the bill now it hits

[01:38:20.740 --> 01:38:24.760]
to the desk of the president which he'll sign it very very very quickly. The bill sets

[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:30.780]
the maximum amount for indecency fines at $325,000 with a $3 million fine as the maximum

[01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:34.660]
for any continuing violations. Three million. We would have started auctioning off a lot

[01:38:34.660 --> 01:38:37.360]
of stuff on eBay. Representing a threat up to the Republican

[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:40.800]
Amish and helping craft the House version of the indecency bill which had stronger language

[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:44.080]
and stiffer penalties he said yesterday we're entering the home and stretching getting

[01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:47.260]
the filth and triple like smud off the public airways. I didn't know there was any triple

[01:38:47.260 --> 01:38:51.480]
like smud on the public airways. Did you? No. No. Triple like smud. This is a show here.

[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:56.860]
Oh yeah well. At their current level listen we've had our balls chopped off let's face it.

[01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:01.240]
We have been neutered and devolved by this president regime. Oh I got a paper a paper

[01:39:01.240 --> 01:39:14.140]
jam. I'm jammed. Oh they have a whole stack of paper in mind that one. Yeah. Okay wait

[01:39:14.140 --> 01:39:17.100]
let's get back at their current levels fines are more of a constant way we already

[01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:21.920]
been through all that. Four representatives spoke last not last night but would have been

[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:26.620]
Wednesday at two then I would only represented Diane Watson Democratic California opposing legislation

[01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:30.600]
according to broadcasting and cable what Watson said to bill was a weak attempt to solve

[01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:34.180]
the issue and called it uncreative policy to the harm our creative community. Well no

[01:39:34.180 --> 01:39:37.920]
question about that more and more man this is part of the growing fascism that's taken

[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:42.100]
over America to fix the lessons enabled us to happen your freedoms are disappearing thanks

[01:39:42.100 --> 01:39:46.060]
to the Patriot Act and all these other acts and the FCC which is make it up as they go

[01:39:46.060 --> 01:39:49.440]
along we like Joyce they have a lot in common they just make it up as they go along well

[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:53.760]
what is in decency where I will tell you well let's do when you do it it's kind of like

[01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:57.100]
the speed limit you know there's no sign out there but the the the porcars are sitting

[01:39:57.100 --> 01:40:00.020]
out there they'll let you know when you're going too fast we're just not going to post

[01:40:00.020 --> 01:40:06.420]
any signs to fit it with the speed limit is oh you're too fast it's a $5,000 fine let's see

[01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:10.280]
did you buy any chance see the date line show last night on teenage predators no I did not

[01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:16.080]
or they're still doing that and then what is this series of 4,000 shows anyway and says

[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:19.160]
well ladyfacts we were talking about you as the program went on because we figured you

[01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:24.740]
would jump right on this morning I don't understand yeah you jumped right on it I haven't

[01:40:24.740 --> 01:40:27.460]
heard you mentioned the end that's because I didn't I wasn't even home to watch it much

[01:40:27.460 --> 01:40:31.140]
less the guys were just grossed all of them and quite a few claim they had found religion

[01:40:31.140 --> 01:40:35.320]
oh I see one was at an evangelical college another was 61 years old and claims it was

[01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:38.520]
the first time he tried to chat on line with 13 year old girl another was a teacher

[01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:41.600]
this is where the Catholics were with their wife and family have a nice day you two

[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:45.580]
and we thought you jump right on this morning see it I mean they're getting a little bit

[01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:50.100]
you know obviously it's a grotesque thing but it's a little bit over when you say a little

[01:40:50.100 --> 01:40:56.140]
overkill yeah obviously they're going to be using this for you know the crack down yeah

[01:40:56.780 --> 01:41:01.060]
well some of these people have a crack problem yeah you know I very seldom do this but yesterday

[01:41:01.060 --> 01:41:07.320]
well I wanted this couple of times but this story by this article by Russell Shaw which

[01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:11.040]
I noticed is our most red story on our website today and Josh got the stories on there

[01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:15.800]
before nine o'clock this morning too nice going all right and culture bitches to kind

[01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:19.560]
of word for you I this is worth this is worth reading again I like because if you heard

[01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:22.620]
it the first time you need to hear it again and if you missed it the first time it's worth

[01:41:22.620 --> 01:41:27.480]
because this needs to be said this she is the epitome of what the whole right wing in America

[01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:31.780]
is all about she she's the poster child right for evil you know your president keeps talking

[01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:35.700]
about evil doers in this and the only evil doers I think is in a bottle I think he's

[01:41:35.700 --> 01:41:41.180]
drinking a lot of it Russell Shaw said and this was written keep in mind Tuesday is that

[01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:45.040]
the issue was on today yeah Tuesday earlier today that today shows Matt Lauer challenged

[01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:48.620]
right wing pundit and caught her on this charming statement of hers the self obsessed

[01:41:48.620 --> 01:41:52.460]
women seem genuinely unaware that nine level was in stack on our nation and acted like

[01:41:52.460 --> 01:41:55.700]
as if the terrorist attack only happened to them they believe the entire country was

[01:41:55.700 --> 01:41:59.840]
required to marinate in their squizzet personal agony apparently the announcing bush was

[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:03.680]
part of the closure process then Matt said and this is part of the part I really need to

[01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:07.460]
talk to you about she had written in her book these broads are millionaires lion eyes

[01:42:07.460 --> 01:42:11.300]
on TV and articles about them reveling in their statuses celebrities and stocked by grief

[01:42:11.300 --> 01:42:15.780]
paratis I've never seen people enjoying their husbands death so much because they dare speak

[01:42:15.780 --> 01:42:20.920]
out master ass Matt last Lauer and quarter then said something of the fact that they left

[01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:24.760]
loves the fact that by being widows these women exude a certain gravitas of quotability

[01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:28.480]
well and if you believe these are reveling millionaire broads and I invite you to be a fly
