[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.820]
Who's coming to the call with that?

[00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:08.220]
Well, the call is whatever the chronics have a big problem with that. We get about 10 votes on that put around there, please

[00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.980]
WQA am a chronic line. Hello. Hey Neil. Yes sir. Yes sir.

[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.220]
30 years of entertaining us

[00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:21.300]
Bob third man and I happen to know for a fact that God only parts of the shower

[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.760]
Really when I fart in the shower? Let me seriously think God uses so for body wash

[00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.940]
I

[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.740]
Use the party wash, but I could tell every time I fart in the shower my girlfriend says Jesus Christ

[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.760]
Yeah, so much must be the Lord must be a passing bad gas

[00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.940]
Cutting the cheese. Well, you know that diet that they're reading back in the day because he you know that that would last supper

[00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.920]
Was a Passover Seder and all that wine was drinking

[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.240]
All the man of shavots see a lot of pina bivalos as was mogen David

[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.380]
But I have it on very good authority a higher authority that was a man of shavots

[00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.800]
Just like Hebrew National a higher three. They ever see those spots for the dog sure as a political sand

[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.800]
They'll give you some real little tear your guts out that's the Hebrew National

[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.660]
Eighth the a kosher hot dogs man. It's really good. It's a kosher for

[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.960]
Sohastura

[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.400]
All the fairy tales all the time. It's halal. Maybe it's halal

[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.060]
See that's a new one on me. I learned it and I know I noticed even on the Indian restaurants now can you explain that to me?

[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.600]
Because the Indians aren't Muslims. No, they're sick

[00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.000]
And if you were

[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.460]
All the crew you'd be sick. Oh, there was a nice Indian kid their last night. It would fun a nice looking young guy

[00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:34.020]
Well, I mean he had he smelled like he was you know how like Warren Kromardi the crow smells like he's taking a bath in cashmere

[00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.680]
Okay, this kid smelled like he was rolling around in curry powder for about right? He was rolling in a hay with kid curry for a month

[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.400]
Oh, geez. Well, let's add all about you know that always right. You are what you eat. I think Charles Schultz invented that

[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.780]
You are what you eat. Remember that in peanuts?

[00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.020]
No

[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.780]
But it's true and that's why a lot of these people have been asking that people with a very

[00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.080]
One-dimensional diet they smell like that

[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.860]
By the way, I'm told we're we're back up on the string. Oh, I see the green light on there green light nice going

[00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.720]
Engineering department you idiots you hey, you know, I don't care who you are

[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.620]
You're fair exactly there such a bunch of lung kids man and even Joe Bell knows that

[00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.260]
I told him about what a great engineer we got here that you know it takes care of stuff when it needs to be taken care of when I'm not

[00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.680]
They're doing it and he said oh maybe we can go get him down here or something like that

[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.980]
Another one was yep-yuck lines from Joe you know yep-yuck

[00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.980]
Like that although payday is Friday and I understand that's been taken care of that's what Robert told me

[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.300]
Only the new deal is now when I get my check with Robert involvement

[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.820]
I've like 10% is taken out because he's a orthodox actually he's not orthodox is he just a low-key self-hating Jew

[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.940]
26 after 10 to 5 60 WQ where we got a whole new attitude baby in fact we can get that pomp and a park spot on if like

[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.100]
Steve Olfins and me some copy I'll do it to hell with the water Nazi to hell with Troy. I'll just do the spot

[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.620]
You know what I'm saying you might away fat boy. You're doing a hell of a job

[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.080]
Just like brownie brown man. You're on the case. You are a case

[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.720]
Holy Makinah. This is Joe boy on the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening to the hockey authority Neil God

[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.020]
anh

[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.320]
Mc

[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.340]
Good

[00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.800]
Good

[00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:43.960]
What can I say?

[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.880]
John's your friend, who has tried to get promise to be

[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.780]
Well, the top door, everybody goes

[00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.640]
I can't tell that ever show

[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.900]
The top door, everybody stays

[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.880]
I got to hear my happy soul, it's the rain

[00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.460]
Well, scream out, scream out, scream out

[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:18.640]
When you think it's too enough for you

[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.320]
You're fairly

[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.760]
scream out, scream out, scream out

[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.060]
Everything is just room

[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.660]
1033, what do we got on the schedule today?

[00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.420]
We got Geldie at the Anthocenter

[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.860]
So must be a home game, like I said, that the

[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.540]
Crapidels against the Panthers at the

[00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.740]
Anthocenter, unless Geldie's going to be

[00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.600]
doing the game off a TV monitor, which is pretty

[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.020]
Bushley.

[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.840]
Mad Dog at 4, and then we got Pantheon

[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.360]
Preview at 630, so Mad Dog has enough

[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.720]
another tough assignment to an Apple

[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.900]
or show. Oh, brother.

[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.080]
In fact, guess what?

[00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.320]
Mad Dog ain't even on tomorrow.

[00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.620]
We got Curtis at Hooters in Durral,

[00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.200]
the Marl and then wow, this is just a mess.

[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.980]
Here's what it is.

[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.040]
And then the Panthers and the Crapidels at 7 o'clock

[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.140]
tonight, biggest game of the season.

[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.080]
I guess they all are right now.

[00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.200]
They're still making this improbable playoff

[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.980]
on any interest.

[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.620]
And then the Hanks give me a son of an

[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.580]
aunt's about the heat.

[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:15.840]
I don't care about the heat.

[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.160]
You care about the heat?

[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.000]
I'm sorry, you tell them.

[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.260]
Am I you Josh? You care about the heat?

[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.860]
Uh, you know, not much.

[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.240]
A little bit.

[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.600]
A little bit, not a lot.

[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.620]
What about the Hurricanes and Michigan on an

[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.960]
IT game on the AM-1360 on the cat,

[00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.140]
with the Clarence and Gettler and Gettys

[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.680]
and the Joe Zagaki, who sucks about that.

[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.580]
Any day after all of the hockey action on QAM.

[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.760]
On QAM, the station that takes the Jewel out of living.

[00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:41.860]
O'Reilly and editor Sparrow,

[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.440]
the sex offender, Casey, I told you I had a

[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.080]
villa rally story.

[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.220]
He's just a real able.

[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:46.200]
Yes he is.

[00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.700]
Managers of the Dayton Daily News have received

[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.340]
more than 900 emails from fans of Fox News Talks,

[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.740]
Shoho and Liar, Bill O'Reilly,

[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.740]
after Riley's website and TV programs

[00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.040]
slammed the paper for an editorial that he says

[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.360]
makes it the most friendly newspaper

[00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.720]
to child rapist in America.

[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.660]
The Dayton Daily News Editorial, which ran Sunday

[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.300]
cautioned against those who have called for removing

[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.180]
Judge John Connor, referring to County County

[00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.720]
Police Court, without a formal complaint or investigation.

[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.180]
After counterade a probation and house arrest instead of

[00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.820]
prison, a man convicted of repeatedly raping two boys.

[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.100]
The defendant Andrew Selva had been charged with 20

[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.740]
counts of rape.

[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.560]
But prosecutors made mistakes in listing the boys'

[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.800]
names on the indictment and tried unsuccessfully to

[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.520]
change the errors.

[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.160]
Top Republican leaders in Ohio began pressing

[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.480]
further removal of Connor after a Riley Culfers impeachment

[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.340]
on his talk show.

[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.000]
So Jeff Bruce, I wonder if he's kind of Gary Bruce.

[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.060]
Editor of the Dayton Daily News defended the

[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.760]
papers editorial yesterday and took a Riley

[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.040]
to task for inflammatory journalism as usual.

[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.340]
We never defended Judge Connor's decision to

[00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.660]
sentence a child molestered a year of

[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.980]
house arrest and five years probation.

[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.540]
Bruce said they prepared statement.

[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.500]
While we said as that if the judge deserves to be

[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.680]
removed from orifice, then due process should be

[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.040]
followed, the same sort of due process that Bill O'Reilly

[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.960]
reputted and relied upon when he was sued for

[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.000]
sexual harassment and ultimately settled out of court.

[00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.140]
Just in case you've been sleeping, O'Reilly was

[00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.480]
sued in 2004 by his former producer for sexual

[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.420]
harassment and phone calls and stuff like that.

[00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.140]
When the suit was settled out of court for an

[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.220]
underserved sum, a Riley Culfers was the media

[00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.020]
lashing he took from foreign a brutal ordeal and

[00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.760]
thanked his listeners for having given him the benefit of

[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:12.980]
doubt when some of the media did not.

[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.600]
Bruce wondered why a Riley won't give Connor the same

[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.280]
benefit of doubt.

[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.800]
In America, we have a system of checks and balances that

[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.140]
include the independence of the judiciary, Bruce said

[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.340]
there are rules in place that we move bad judges.

[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.920]
Our editorial simply said we should follow those rules,

[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.380]
not allow ourselves to rush to judgment because of

[00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.800]
a television commentators' opinions.

[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:30.260]
Amen.

[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.600]
A Riley through a producer said,

[00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.980]
personal attacks launched on me disqualified the

[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.580]
Dayton Daily News from any serious debate.

[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.520]
We believe that Jeff Bruce is not the honest individual.

[00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.580]
But I would be like Greg Reed calling somebody a liar.

[00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:43.080]
A pervericator.

[00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.780]
What newspaper in the US of America is most friendly to

[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.760]
child rapers could be the Dayton Daily News, which is

[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.800]
supported judge John Connor sent in the probation for a

[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.640]
man who ripped a five-year-old boy into 12-year-old boy

[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.360]
over three-year period?

[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.400]
Not only that, but the Dayton Daily News attacked the governor

[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.640]
of Ohio, the attorney general of Ohio and Bill Aroli,

[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.520]
for reporting the story and actually asking for the

[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.380]
removal of Judge Connor.

[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.280]
The vicious personal attacks launched by the Dayton Daily News

[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.340]
were strained when contrasting the lack of

[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.380]
condemnation for the judge.

[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.400]
So one can conclude, therefore, that the Dayton Daily News is

[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.240]
a newspaper that has sympathy for child rapists and the judges

[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.420]
will not incarcerate them.

[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.520]
That's all that a personal attack.

[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.340]
They say only two things happen when you wrestle a pig.

[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.080]
You get muddy and a pig enjoys it.

[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.560]
So it's tempting to just let this pass, but really what Aroli

[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.920]
had said on his website is so outrageous and such a

[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.500]
distortion that I can't, says Jeff Bruce.

[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:27.920]
Here is a buddy.

[00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.280]
No crime is more heinous, more heinous than

[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.640]
child molestation, so it's understandable that people will be

[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.700]
inflamed by the notion that a petarist evaded the punishment

[00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:37.220]
he's due.

[00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:39.680]
But when Mr. O'Reilly asked the question on his website,

[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.420]
what newspaper in the USA is most friendly to child rapists?

[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.720]
He's egging on his readers without giving them all the facts,

[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.240]
as usual.

[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.300]
As readers of the Dayton Daily News know, this newspaper is not

[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.060]
soft on child molest, who's just the opposite.

[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.600]
Here's what's really happening.

[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.240]
Oh, the truth?

[00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.240]
Mr. O'Reilly's upset with the newspaper because in an editorial

[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.860]
we referred to his own recent legal history in which he was accused of sexual harassment.

[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:03.560]
His producer threatened that unless we published an apology, they would resort to their bully pulpit

[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.400]
and that's what they've done.

[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.460]
This isn't about being soft on child molesters.

[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.240]
It's about Bill O'Reilly getting even.

[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:12.560]
We never defended Judge O'Connor's decision to sentence the child molester to a year of house arrest

[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.560]
and five years probation.

[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.560]
What we said is that if the judge deserves to be removed from office,

[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:20.500]
then due process should be followed with the same sort of process that O'Reilly relied upon when he was sued.

[00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:25.040]
The editorial also noted that the prosecutor in the case, while disappointed with the judge's sentence,

[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.700]
was afraid his evidence was so weak that he might have lost the case entirely for when to trial,

[00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:29.840]
he's agreed to settle a case.

[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:34.080]
In America, we have a system of checks and balances that includes the independence of the judiciary.

[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.340]
There are rules in place to remove bad judges.

[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.460]
Our editorial simply said we should follow those rules, not allow ourselves to arrest a judgment

[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.380]
because of a television commentator's opinions.

[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.100]
That's not an endorsement of Judge O'Connor or his decision.

[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.680]
The fact that a child molester got off so lightly is disgusting.

[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.940]
If I would fall our editorial for anything, it's that we could have said that and said it more firmly.

[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.320]
But that's not why O'Reilly asked his readers to write the newspaper.

[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.060]
His producer in the conversation with me acknowledged the logic of our editorials and argument,

[00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.720]
but they felt ragging O'Reilly's own legal problems in the article was gratuitous.

[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.900]
While I expected O'Reilly to take a shot of us, I was shocked that he was suggested this newspaper

[00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:11.280]
has simply for child rapists and say deliberate distortion what we said and what we stand for

[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.020]
and nothing could be further from the truth.

[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.360]
So you know, on the same page that we published the editorial,

[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.620]
we also printed a package of opposing views, including most of O'Reilly himself.

[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.440]
We made every effort to be fair and balanced in our presentation of this issue.

[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:28.820]
It's a pity that that sense of fairness was not reciprocated by the unfair and unbalanced Fox News of lunatic.

[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:29.920]
I like that.

[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.940]
Typical, same old crap, sure.

[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.080]
Just like Anne Colter that gets on her and shoots off her big mouth.

[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.240]
And anytime she's on it with anybody that's got an IQ larger than their thumbnail,

[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.800]
they are shooting down right away because she's always giving wrong facts.

[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:41.360]
Miss information.

[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.040]
That's what ought to be her nickname.

[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:43.900]
Miss information.

[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.020]
What's that out of the apple?

[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:47.020]
That's a guy's.

[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:48.500]
Tell her you're fair.

[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:48.820]
Yeah.

[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:49.740]
Hey Anne.

[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.940]
I don't care who you are.

[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:51.720]
You're fair.

[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.800]
Maybe she and the Miss Fudge are doing something, you know?

[00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.980]
Maybe they're checking their own goods.

[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:56.960]
They should be out of package.

[00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:58.520]
Mm-hmm.

[00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.140]
Care package.

[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:00.960]
That's right.

[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:01.660]
I don't care.

[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:02.800]
How's that poll coming today?

[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.780]
Let's see what pisses off the audience about what I say.

[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:05.420]
Not too much.

[00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:06.160]
Damn it.

[00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.560]
Which of Niels comments piss you off the most?

[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:09.820]
None of his comments.

[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:10.600]
488.

[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:12.160]
84%.

[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:12.620]
Well good.

[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.380]
We like people.

[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:15.320]
That's what we want.

[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.260]
We want ditto heads like Rush, you know, and O'Reilly.

[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:18.480]
What people would most agree with everything?

[00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.040]
No, seriously.

[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:20.900]
Ditto, ditto, ditto.

[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:21.320]
Lot of them.

[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.060]
They're all that crap.

[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.120]
His comments about politics 23.

[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.960]
His comments about religion 19.

[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:27.760]
You idiots.

[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.680]
His comments about guns 19.

[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.000]
How about guns in religion?

[00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:32.560]
Oh, he's been a good mix.

[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:34.680]
Don't want to believe what I believe?

[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:35.520]
About a thing.

[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.520]
Uh, comments about black 17.

[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:40.200]
What comments about blacks?

[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.720]
His comments about Orthodox Jews 7.

[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:43.560]
You mean Getshes?

[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:48.400]
But those so many old big hats and the tallesses and the tits and that and that stuff.

[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.520]
Okay, we can't say tits.

[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:50.480]
Nothing more.

[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.680]
You think Joyce even knows what tits are?

[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.040]
Even you know what it is.

[00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:55.400]
That's right.

[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:56.500]
I know all the gear.

[00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:57.480]
I'm going to get me an outfit.

[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.900]
You already had one and then you're died from it.

[00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:02.680]
His comments about Cubans 6.

[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.880]
His comments about red next to and his comments about the colors 1.

[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.160]
Well guess what?

[00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:10.680]
This is Neil Rogers.

[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.400]
As far as the college know.

[00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:13.060]
Space 5.

[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:13.540]
16.

[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:14.480]
A.

[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:18.960]
In the basket.

[00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:19.620]
Yeah.

[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:23.180]
Oh, I got to agree with you.

[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.840]
You know, I hate to do it because it's boring.

[00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:25.540]
I know you hate it.

[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.080]
But the thing about fat people you're right.

[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.800]
Well, go in there yourself and that's a right.

[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:29.880]

[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:30.860]
Nothing will help.

[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.720]
It's just that usually a lot of time.

[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:33.160]
That's right.

[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.220]
And you know how Hank brushes me off every time I bring you to even about that

[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:40.720]
and I'm sure that a fat slide like him and me both love pasta.

[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:46.780]
But you just, any thing that has to do with like health or blood sugar or stopping a big fat with a death weight.

[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.200]
Right.

[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.040]
And not interested in it.

[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.760]
Really they're going to brush off or enough off.

[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:51.040]
Right.

[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.260]
Well you're trying to pull.

[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:52.440]
Yeah.

[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.420]
Well, I give up.

[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:54.920]
Give it up.

[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:55.580]
There you go.

[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:56.120]
I'm doing fun.

[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:56.780]
187.

[00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:58.080]
That's the lowest I've weighed in years.

[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.960]
I mean I'm like my real digital scale that you can't like lean one side to the other.

[00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:03.960]
You can't do a fixed one.

[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.040]
Well, you know what I'm talking about.

[00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:06.560]
It's called the dance of the Nile.

[00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:07.220]
Yeah.

[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.680]
The dance, the one foot dance.

[00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:11.180]
The green apple quick hop on the scale.

[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.380]
Maybe if I hold the towel rack.

[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:13.020]
Right.

[00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:13.520]
That's it.

[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.820]
Although I do take off my wristwatch when I get it.

[00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.380]
Well, it's just, you know, I do.

[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:18.040]

[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.200]
The citizen is pretty heavy.

[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.600]
Make sure you go to the bathroom first.

[00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:22.040]
Oh, you kid me.

[00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:22.980]
Do all you're a blue system.

[00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:23.380]
That's right.

[00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:24.200]
We're hop on the scale.

[00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.120]
Well, that's the way to do it.

[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.140]
That's the way to get your true weight.

[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.100]
Let the air out of your lungs.

[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:28.160]
Yeah.

[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.840]
The Pentagon said yesterday it's investigating two incidents in which you ask troops allegedly

[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.700]
killed more than two dozen Iraqi civilians.

[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.680]
The claims raised by families of victims in local Iraqi police threatened to worsen relations

[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.940]
with Iraqis upset by the earlier abuse cases.

[00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:44.280]
A criminal investigation had began March 9.

[00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.120]
Oh, it's a Robert Creeper investigation.

[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.980]
March 9 is when it started.

[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:52.700]
Focuses on allocations by Iraqi civilians which were reported by Tom Magazine that Marines

[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:57.380]
killed 15 civilians in Haditha in November after a roadside bomb killed a member of their unit.

[00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.140]
The Pentagon also stated this.

[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:03.900]
The start of this week to look at claims by local Iraqi police that US forces killed 11 civilians,

[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:08.500]
including five children and a six months old, duray or raid last week in a house in a shaki,

[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.960]
about 60 miles north of Baghdad, is shaki.

[00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:13.760]
The claims referred to reported by Nightrider newspapers.

[00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.500]
All the troops involved remained on active duty so Lieutenant Colonel Barry Johnson.

[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:23.460]
In the allegiance in Haditha about 140 miles northwest of Baghdad, the Marines came under fire after the bombing

[00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:26.740]
and tracked insurgents for hours to residential areas amongst and amongst civilians,

[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:29.920]
said he was military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Michelle Martin Hing.

[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:36.420]
Times had obtained a videotape of the aftermath of the incident, and Iraqi human rights group has provided copies of the video,

[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.820]
which shows bodies and blood stains to media organizations including Reuters.

[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:45.040]
The video, which is not been authenticated by the Pentagon, doesn't tell the whole story, Martin Hing said, whatever that meant.

[00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.660]
That anyway, you can be sure it's true.

[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:51.160]
And your buddy Doug Thompson, Capitol Hill, blew rhymes with true.

[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:51.760]
Right.

[00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:52.600]
He's the man.

[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.460]
He says, Bush can't stop lying.

[00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.300]
How do you like that?

[00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:02.060]
For anybody who don'tings or liars between George W. Bush and Greg Reed,

[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:04.740]
allow me honestly to great start to look better with each passing day.

[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.100]
Oh, please bring him back. Please.

[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.020]
And the SCRAN.

[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.320]
Let's get Greg and SCRAN back again.

[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.380]
Get him back together again.

[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:13.920]
That is one.

[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:16.640]
Wouldn't be the first time.

[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:21.600]
Americans who tuned in for one of President George W. Bush's rare press conference

[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.680]
saw a cornered animal trying to squirm his way.

[00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.060]
And that what Puppy says in that bit with Regis wouldn't be the first time.

[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.900]
And that's what what's his name says.

[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:31.440]
What's the other one?

[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:32.680]
ODB.

[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:34.420]
Oh yeah, old dirty band.

[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:35.180]
Thirty, we call it.

[00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:36.040]
It wouldn't be the first time.

[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:36.920]
Word.

[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:38.060]
Yeah.

[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.200]
But third man.

[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.580]
That's how many times he'd been in trouble.

[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:49.380]
Americans who tuned in for one of George W. Bush's rare press conferences saw a cornered animal trying to squirm his way out of trouble by doing what he's always done evading the truth.

[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:58.420]
Bush's attempt to showcase himself as a leader who could handle tough questions from the press corps fell just as flat as his unscripted town meeting style appearance and cleave on the day before.

[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:03.520]
His eyes darted from side to side as he fueled the question about his real reasons for invading Iraq.

[00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:08.480]
He stammered, stalled, used the word, aw, more times than a suspect caught red handed.

[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:10.860]
He still claimed his reasons for invading Iraq were just.

[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:12.740]
Even though those reasons have been proven wrong.

[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.980]
It claims the work can be won if you're not shared by many of his generals.

[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.820]
He claimed a lot of things few of them true.

[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:22.020]
President Bush exhibited symptoms of pathological perverification.

[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:30.720]
Perverications at Dr. Stephanie Crossfield, a psychologist who treats people who have trouble telling the truth and who watch Bush's performances on Monday and Tuesday in my request, said Doug Thompson.

[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:38.280]
His eye movements, gestures, and changes in voice tone all displayed traits of consistent evasion of the truth, not to mention that annoying nervous laugh.

[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:42.680]
This is the first time I've asked Dr. Crossfield a study of politicians.

[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:48.460]
She watched several informal President Clinton's press conferences and came to similar conclusions about Clinton's disassociation with reality.

[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.280]
When studying a subject, she watches the eyes.

[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.980]
Eye movement is difficult to control, she said.

[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:57.580]
You find that the eyes dart away in specific patterns when a person is not telling the truth.

[00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.400]
The president's eyes dart a great deal.

[00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.240]
He's not comfortable facing the truth.

[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.580]
Dr. Justin Frank, I wonder if he's kind to Dr. Neal Frank.

[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:09.200]
Author of the book Bush on the couch inside the mind of the president agrees with Dr. Crossfield.

[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:13.440]
President Bush marches deeper and deeper into a world of his own, says Dr. Frank.

[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:19.900]
Center of the Bush's world is an iron will which demands that external reality be changed to conform with his personal view of how things are.

[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.920]
Republicans reluctantly admit Bush's laws touched with the truth.

[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.920]
Senator Chuck Hagel says the president is disconnected from reality.

[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:32.780]
Venture out beyond the beltway and you find conservative Republicans shaking their heads and wondering the same thing.

[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:38.760]
Dennis Dalby cuts the hair of Cam Pendleton's young Marines, giving them the regulation haircut before they head to combat in Iraq.

[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:45.000]
His barber shop in the coast highway near the basin, California, is covered with painted yellow ribbons, flags, and we support our troopspanners.

[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:50.160]
But Dalby, Republican and self-described conservative who voted for Bush, says he's fed up with the president's lies.

[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:52.940]
An office in office says it's time to bring the boys home.

[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:59.580]
In San Marcos, retired Navy veteran, her brainquist, 77 sits in the local VFW Hall and says Bush is a failure.

[00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:04.880]
I voted for him two times and wish I hadn't ran quisted, it was probably one of the worst mistakes I ever made.

[00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:12.460]
Dr. Crossfield says it doesn't take a degree in psychology or advanced training and spotting liars to realize the president placed fast and loose with the truth.

[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.380]
More and more ordinary Americans see the evidence clearly every day, she says, it's difficult to ignore.

[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.140]
Dr. Frank says Bush can't change his ways.

[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.660]
Taking responsibility has always been hard for W.

[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:28.900]
He says taking responsibility for inflicting harm on others is a major step in developing a maturity is the step president push has yet to make.

[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:32.660]
And steady persistent lying to himself and to the American people.

[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.000]
There's your buddy, Dr. Joe Good.

[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:35.940]
Like that is what I'm right on and as usual.

[00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:41.380]
There's a fast you just let me it says and colder suffers from Marfan syndrome.

[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:42.760]
Marfan syndrome?

[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:49.100]
Marfan syndrome is a connective tissue to sort of characterized by usually long limbs, the form skeleton lungs eyes and heart.

[00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:54.540]
Probably while she has Adam's apple gigantic, no sympathy for me it says you know she's an ex-girlfriend of Bill Mar.

[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.740]
A weird ass couple. Oh yeah kind of like Mary Madeline and she.

[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:08.040]
That's got to be a scam. Oh what that couple Bill Mar and the ankle Mary Madeline and no I don't know that one's for real.

[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:11.880]
I think the one that one's got to be a scam and colder with any man is what have to be a scam.

[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:16.720]
Yes me and I'm a me I want to say I don't care who you are you fair right.

[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:23.720]
618 votes which in yields comments piss you off the most none of them 519 none of the above 84%.

[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:29.900]
Why that special his comments about politics 26 guns 20 guns. Oh yeah.

[00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:35.380]
Oh my guns man don't take away my guns my peace my rod. Hey we're going to need them.

[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:41.940]
What a rod yeah how much he making is a coming revolution his comments about religion 19.

[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:50.340]
His comments about blacks 18. His comments about Orthodox Jews 7 I told Mo to substitute verses.

[00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:55.380]
His comments about Cuban 6 his comments about red next to and his comments about colors 1.

[00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:03.380]
So I meant to you know about the colors because the audience knows the listeners know that all my comments about the colors are absolutely correct.

[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:08.020]
They can be Q.A.M. Hello. I'm your favorite. I'm saying there you go.

[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:14.380]
I rest my case. What do you talk about the proof being right there right right right out of the open just reach out and grab bigger tips.

[00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:18.040]
Yeah right at the end of your index finger in the middle one too.

[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:22.800]
Marine down rights boy you're sure doing a lot of yellow I got to make up for the right time.

[00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:26.520]
Yes. I'm going to show a show I beg your right news either that's right until I get.

[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:31.180]
Why don't care if you like it or not we're not programming you have no arbitraried diaries.

[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:37.520]
Yeah. You're not going to help put us over the top as if we care where is the copy from Steve Olf from Poppano Park.

[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:47.080]
You know it's just it's just amazing and Troy Stradford comes in there to like handle me with some other crap while I do this for him while I do that.

[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:53.880]
Yeah no problem Troy but how about taking care of the ones we already got and there's plenty of room for a spot today which he there was no real response to that.

[00:20:54.040 --> 00:21:00.540]
We're going to talk to Phyllis about it. Well screw Phyllis okay she's leaving anyway the hell would that bitch the water Nazi the hell with that.

[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:04.280]
Who the hell and she decided once we got plenty of a place to put that on there.

[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:11.720]
You know they're always whining. La la la the sale department was awful. La la. Yeah well how about now is it any better now?

[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:16.420]
No. It's a disaster. It's not an accident waiting to happen. It's an accident that already happened.

[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:21.080]
It's a disaster even on the Titanic they never saw anything like this.

[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:25.960]
On QAM the station that takes the Jewel out of life. Somebody QAM hello.

[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.580]
One of our better ones right there QAM hello.

[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:35.640]
Hello. Hello. Yeah. I can't believe I got through.

[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:44.180]
Two more ahead on the alien. We already heard about it. Yeah she's an idiot. Yes. And she's feeling very rich or browser.

[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:49.780]
Did the FU for her. Yeah we already heard about it. Okay I'm sorry. Have a good day.

[00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:56.180]
Okay 70 QAM hello. See these are the top show groupies. These are the people want to talk about Anne Coder and Bill O'Reilly.

[00:21:56.180 --> 00:22:01.900]
I mean I just got gave you Bill O'Reilly's story but it has something to do with something current, something meaningful.

[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:07.580]
As opposed to what we are restating the obvious that we hate Anne Coder and Bill O'Reilly like poison in which they would both croak.

[00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:12.920]
How does that captain Harris do? We got to stir about her. Oh I was saying they did a big news thing on her.

[00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:17.080]
She's selling everything man. Yeah. We're organizing the house. She's going to be dying. She got her hands on.

[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:24.300]
And you know what I told her too. As you said Gornestelfin. Mm-hmm. Before I get to Marie and Dowd, Harris pledges to sell all her assets.

[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:29.300]
Why ain't going to get much for that? That's pretty much a dime. This is from the Tampa Tribune.

[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:37.400]
US representative Catherine Harris continued her attempt to take her campaign to national TV and to add religious overtones to request for US Senate State

[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.220]
with an appearance on nightline last night ABC News.

[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:45.960]
Harris told John Donovan about line that she intends to sell all her personal assets to fund the race.

[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:50.840]
My husband has real estate but I won't own anything she says. Well good. Including that seat in the Senate.

[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:56.060]
Since making a pledge last week to put 10 million bucks of her money into the race, Harris has made the phrase

[00:22:56.060 --> 00:23:00.740]
putting everything on the line a new campaign theme. She's going to put her back on the line.

[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:06.980]
I'm wondering to take this widow's mic. This pearl of great price and put everything on the line she told Donovan.

[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:11.300]
No matter how much you have, are you willing to take what you have and sell all of it for a great price?

[00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:18.000]
Donovan didn't ask her about her links to defense contractor Mitchell Wade who recently did a guilty to bribe in California Congressman Duk.

[00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:22.200]
Donovan told the Tribune there was no agreement to avoid any subject in the interview.

[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:31.260]
Since revelations about those links to agreement court documents three weeks ago, Harris has avoided interviews with Florida reporters and answered very few substantive questions about the issue.

[00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:35.840]
Instead she has chosen non-confrontational venues for speaking to the public.

[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:44.960]
She made her pledge about her campaign donation to the interview with commentators Sean Hannity and a vowed fan of hers on his uncle's right wing Nazi Fox News TV talk show.

[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:52.020]
For the nightline segment, a camera crew followed her most of Thursday including filming a scene of AIDS hustling her away from reporters after a campaign event.

[00:23:52.280 --> 00:24:02.520]
So they wouldn't be able to ask her any questions. Nightline once known for the hard-hitting reviews of Ted Coppola's change since he left abandoning the format of examining a single issue in death in favor of several topics on each show.

[00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:14.000]
What it's done has become much more of a mixed bag than before. It does some tough-minded stuff and some fluffy stuff said Columbia University of journalism professor Richard Wald, former top news executive of ABC and NBC.

[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.100]
He said the show can still examine issue in depth, but they're much more wedded to shorter pieces.

[00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:25.320]
Harris has also had a religious component to her campaign. The phrases widow's might and pearl of great price are both biblical.

[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:35.620]
Oh yeah, widow's might in the book of Mark refers to a poor widow witnessed by Jesus contributing a tiny amount of money a might to the temple treasury while wealthy people contributed large sums.

[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:38.180]
Jesus said the widow gave more because she cast all.

[00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:42.220]
I have no speaking of widow's might. I happen to know that widow's will.

[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:52.500]
In your case, cast no stone. This is Neil Roger. What solid this is 5162.8.

[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:02.640]
This is the Neil Roger show. This is your boy. We just hope you both. Any questions?

[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:06.720]
We're watching the game. They need a modified voice and I'm gonna sprint.

[00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:11.640]
Made the best woman to win. Here's how to win. And it's easy. I believe I'm gonna win.

[00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:14.640]
And it's dark time. You may be a winner. You're a real winner.

[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.700]
You and me are this proud.

[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:25.520]
So the final part is going down. And you're holding your laptop on the ground.

[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:37.940]
And you're holding your laptop on the ground.

[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:37.940]

[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:37.940]

[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:37.940]

[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:37.960]
And you're holding your laptop on the ground.

[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:41.020]
And you're holding your laptop on the ground.

[00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:55.500]
And you're holding your laptop on the ground.

[00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:55.500]

[00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:56.100]
And you're holding your laptop on the ground.

[00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:58.340]
And you're holding your laptop on the ground.

[00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:01.700]
And you're holding your laptop on the ground.

[00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:04.480]
I've got to get back to work.

[00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:06.440]
I'm strong with you. Get ready.

[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.620]
So how you do with your card, boys.

[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:13.980]
You're out, wasn't you? That wasn't doing well up until this point.

[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.760]
Oh, but now you're done. I've done my teams out.

[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:17.760]
And what about Josh?

[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:23.700]
I got three of the four final fours still in it, but one team that I had go into the dances

[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:24.000]
out.

[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.700]
So, through my dancing?

[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:26.380]
No, then.

[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:27.620]
Oh, over a dance.

[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:28.780]
I hate when that happens.

[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:30.600]
How could an team's dance?

[00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:34.980]
During training, 9-11 hijackers have been in a plane on a Miami runway.

[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:35.600]
How do you like that?

[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:39.840]
Thank goodness we had a lot of a warning, a head of 9-11, too bad we didn't take advantage of it.

[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:43.660]
In fact, that's the Maureen Dowcombe flying into a building who could imagine.

[00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:49.020]
But anyway, two of the pilot hijackers from the 9-11, 2000 motor tanks have been in a smaller

[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:53.280]
plane on a taxiway of Miami International during their flight training, but their actions didn't

[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:55.120]
attract serious scrutiny from federal officials.

[00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:58.240]
A witness in these as a Carrius Musawi trial said yesterday.

[00:26:58.700 --> 00:26:58.860]
Today.

[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:00.960]
Today.

[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:05.720]
A flight instructor at the school where 9-11 hijackers, Muhammad Ata and Mar-1 Al-Shehi received commercial

[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:10.300]
pilot training testified at the death penalty trial of Musawi who's confessing an al-Qaeda terrorist.

[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:18.940]
Instructor Daniel Purcell has to provide the instructors at the school of breed they collected sigh of relief when Ata and Al-Shehi completed their training and left the school.

[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:25.320]
Purcell said that the December 26, 2000 incident in the Miami Airport was one of several problems the school had with the pair.

[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.100]
They had a bad pair.

[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:34.940]
Purcell said the FAA called the Florida School to be rate school officials after the plane was left under runway, but he said the FAA never questioned Ata or Al-Shehi.

[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.920]
I mean, what would be questionable about that?

[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:48.740]
Prosecutors are presenting testimony about the 9-11 pilot hijackers training and a pair effort to show perils between Musawi's flight training and that of the other hijackers during testimony yesterday.

[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:55.640]
A terrorism supervisor in FBI headquarters dismissed a field agent's concern about Musawi in the weeks before 9-11 as Hunches and Subpositions.

[00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:03.700]
The supervisor Michael Rowans testified that he hadn't even read on August 18, 2001, memo written by Minneapolis agent Harry Samut,

[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:09.080]
who arrested Musawi and was convinced from the outset that Musawi was a terrorist with Penn's time-jack aircraft.

[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:12.180]
One thing about this government, they couldn't fight a terrorist in their own living room.

[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.480]
They knew where they were.

[00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.560]
Yeah, they knew where they were and they were just making sure that they were there.

[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:17.120]
Oh, they were there.

[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.560]
Yeah, what the plan was.

[00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:22.100]
Marine downrights, I don't want to do all four hours of reading here today.

[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:23.860]
I'm probably going to take some really good calls.

[00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:24.560]
Take that one right now.

[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:25.840]
We don't have any.

[00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:26.100]
Oh.

[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.540]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.720]
What are calls have really the last two weeks in a half?

[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.180]
Right after that anniversary deal, man.

[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.700]
This new regime of ours, we're like becoming marginalized.

[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:39.780]
We're like on the ages of life, becoming.

[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:41.940]
Now, we really are.

[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.880]
Uh-oh, suspicious package found on White House grounds.

[00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:47.260]
I think Warren V. he was using.

[00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:48.740]
It was a big package.

[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:49.960]
Could have been man-coltar.

[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:52.880]
Uh-oh, not that big.

[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.000]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.140]
Here's my last attempt to get somebody involved in the show today.

[00:28:59.140 --> 00:28:59.740]
This is weak.

[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:00.900]
This is really pathetic.

[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.780]
And pound five, 60 on the Verizon Singular Wireless Line.

[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:07.800]
A town without pity.

[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:09.520]
I know you could play it again, Jean Pitney.

[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.580]
Oh, I got a part of it.

[00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:13.600]
But not near that Eden again, are you?

[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:14.020]
Again.

[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:14.860]
From here.

[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:16.320]
Oh, that was great.

[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:16.860]
Oh.

[00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:18.620]
See what it does to your system.

[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:20.560]
W-E-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:21.300]
Hey, Neil.

[00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:22.140]
Yes, sir.

[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:23.360]
Hey, I like it when you read.

[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:24.380]
Keep reading, man.

[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:25.120]
Yeah.

[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:26.000]
Thank you.

[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:26.700]
Okay.

[00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:28.080]
Uh-huh.

[00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:29.980]
W-E-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:32.620]
There he is.

[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:33.440]
Jean Pitney, baby.

[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:34.200]
Oh!

[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.760]
Have a strange looking dude.

[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:37.040]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:37.600]
Okay, sorry.

[00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:38.700]
Q-A-M.

[00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:39.420]
Cut!

[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:39.960]
Sorry.

[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:42.980]
W-E-Q-A-M, line nine.

[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.040]
No, we're very weak.

[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.500]
I was thinking maybe we could spend a couple hours having like, uh,

[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.280]
Eddie wannabe's calling.

[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.200]
And see if you can do the best Eddie.

[00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:54.880]
A couple hours.

[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:55.380]
I know it.

[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:55.660]
Huh?

[00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:56.740]
We could do four of that.

[00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:58.040]
Four hours on that.

[00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:58.260]
Yeah.

[00:29:58.400 --> 00:29:59.960]
Well, we're getting some line nine always.

[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:00.740]
Uh-huh.

[00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:04.540]
See, like, they said in the exes, there was only one.

[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:05.040]
That's right.

[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:05.620]
And then that's true.

[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:06.280]
There's only one.

[00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.380]
But there are a lot of wannabes out there.

[00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:10.740]
We got the Prozac Ron wannabes.

[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:11.840]
We got 81 abes.

[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:13.540]
We even got Garver wannabes.

[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:16.380]
W-E-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:17.300]
wannabe line.

[00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:18.740]
I feel.

[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:19.500]
Yes.

[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:20.520]
What a good Q-K.

[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:23.380]
W-E-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:24.820]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:25.440]
Okay.

[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:30.680]
Listen, I read this thing in the Times yesterday with Pat Filman's father there trying to figure

[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:33.720]
out just how his son died over there in Afghanistan.

[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:34.340]
Yeah.

[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:36.000]
And there was a heartbreaking story.

[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:41.240]
And, you know, just like Jessica Lynch, they put out this line of BS at the beginning and

[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.420]
slowly the stories start to fall apart.

[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:49.400]
I just thought of as a parent how you sit there and agonize over what really happened to his son.

[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.760]
It's torture and you can't get a straight answer.

[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:56.200]
And then when you find out that Pat's long time high school and college buddy went off in the

[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:59.020]
join to follow in the footsteps, I mean, that could need serious help.

[00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:00.300]
He must be a nut job.

[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:03.220]
I don't get it, but I mean, it was just a bit weird.

[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:08.920]
I just remind me of Nazi Germany, you know, when they were bombing Berlin, they were telling them,

[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.480]
oh, this is the last death toll of the Allies.

[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:12.900]
They're ready to give up.

[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:14.220]
And of course, you're right.

[00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:14.560]
Well, you're right.

[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:18.360]
President told us many months ago now that the insurgency was in its waning days.

[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:19.440]
It's waning over here.

[00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:20.180]
Right.

[00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:22.320]
Yeah, just a few of them left in there.

[00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:26.800]
The similarity between Germany Vietnam and this is a theory.

[00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:27.500]
Amen.

[00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:27.900]
Thank you.

[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:28.060]
A theory.

[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.800]
56670560, just like Kissinger told us in Vietnam, peace is in our hand.

[00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:36.020]
He had a peace in his hand, though, right?

[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:36.980]
Peace of what?

[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:37.840]
Something.

[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:39.720]
Ask.

[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:40.880]
WDQA-M, hello.

[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:41.700]
Neil.

[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:42.520]
Yes, sir.

[00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:43.620]
Hey, how you doing?

[00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:44.500]
Well, back to our team.

[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:45.440]
You're on the radio.

[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:49.840]
You're eating chocolate and ice cream and all you're still doing all that?

[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:50.380]
No.

[00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:51.640]
That's right.

[00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:53.780]
You're diabetic, aren't you?

[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:54.500]
Yeah.

[00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:56.880]
Well, I have a idea for a poll then.

[00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:01.140]
Which body parts are going to get amputated first if you keep eating all those sweets?

[00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:01.840]
Yes.

[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.400]
I was thinking your left foot.

[00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:05.940]
Right.

[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:07.720]
Right away, and hello.

[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:10.000]
George, George, what can't fix us?

[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:14.220]
Oh, hey, man.

[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:14.900]
You are.

[00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:15.420]
Absolutely.

[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:16.840]
Wow.

[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.960]
Talk about an engineering disaster.

[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:21.280]
WDQA-M, hello.

[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:24.160]
That was probably PVLini again.

[00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:26.100]
So here's the Eddie wannabe line.

[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:27.180]
wannabe line QAM?

[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:28.860]
Bill.

[00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:29.640]
Yes, sir.

[00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:33.560]
I saw V for Bendetta yesterday.

[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:37.440]
I can't believe George said that it was a week.

[00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:39.060]
Only gave it a six, man.

[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.360]
It was great movie.

[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:41.320]
Great movie.

[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:42.060]
Definitely an eight.

[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:43.000]
That's definitely an eight.

[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:44.340]
What was great about it?

[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:49.340]
I had the storyline, you know, just kept your interest the whole time, I thought.

[00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:50.960]
The guy looked like a zero.

[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:52.100]
Pardon me?

[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:53.560]
I said, have a great day.

[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:58.480]
567-0560, pound 566, the only Verizon singular right on the side.

[00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:01.760]
See, your taste is in your touch today, so he said that George has got his thumb on it better.

[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:05.180]
George who fell asleep during network would like to V for victory a lot better.

[00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:07.800]
And loved zero.

[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.000]
What was that one zero movie?

[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:10.600]
The Gabe Blade.

[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:11.100]
What was that?

[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.320]
Zero The Gabe Blade.

[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.240]
Wasn't that it?

[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.200]
Yeah, who the hell was in that?

[00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:14.820]
Was that George Hamilton?

[00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:16.020]
George Hamilton.

[00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:17.720]
Oh, George Hamilton was in it.

[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:18.580]
Well, guess what, George?

[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:19.720]
I mean, George Hamilton.

[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:20.840]
I don't care who you are.

[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:21.680]
You're fair.

[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.940]
Good job and Godfather 3, by the way, not.

[00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:27.160]
I mean, he was just ridiculous.

[00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:28.700]
How many QAM, hello?

[00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:30.040]
Four, Neil.

[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:30.860]
Yes, sir.

[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:34.520]
Yeah, listen, I have regards to you from Regent Filben.

[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:35.740]
I read that.

[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000]
Yeah, I was just a hard rock live last week for his show.

[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:41.100]
And I met him after the show.

[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:42.220]
It's big in a boat.

[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.000]
There he is.

[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:45.600]
What did he say?

[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.040]
I talked to him and mentioned your name.

[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:52.140]
And he said that that afternoon or that morning rather he was sitting by the pool.

[00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:56.340]
And he listened to a couple hours of your show to shame eating Korea.

[00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:57.720]
Yeah, he did that.

[00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:58.620]
That's where that came from.

[00:33:58.700 --> 00:33:59.460]
He did call me.

[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:00.880]
We were talked on the phone.

[00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:03.400]
That's where that clip came from.

[00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:04.700]
But you know what he says?

[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:06.160]
It's big in a boat.

[00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:08.360]
That's a recognized voice where he's talking to you.

[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.720]
He's like, well, is this great to you?

[00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:12.600]
Amazingly, but it's on a really good show.

[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:13.640]
Who does?

[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:15.700]
I read this. He's very entertaining.

[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:17.700]
Okay, well, I haven't seen that one.

[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:18.780]
Okay, right.

[00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:19.560]
That's a lot of family.

[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:20.600]
Yeah, you're okay, Regis.

[00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:24.040]
Hey, if Regis is such a big fan, send a bag of money, Regis, okay?

[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:27.960]
Now, the eventually he ever had was on that now-deafunk health network, whatever that thing was.

[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:28.640]
That was a lot of fun.

[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:29.460]
It was a very funny show.

[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:32.120]
I think the word was that except me.

[00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:33.820]
I don't think I ever saw it.

[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.560]
And his wife was on it too.

[00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:36.020]
What's her name?

[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:36.640]
Joy.

[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:37.400]
Joy.

[00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:38.880]
Yeah, very good.

[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:40.480]
Joy.

[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:42.560]
Yeah, I can't believe that you remember that.

[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:44.560]
He was a little half-over-wire.

[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:47.360]
Can you imagine how she hated Kathy Lee just like poison?

[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:48.220]
I mean, oh, man.

[00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:51.580]
Of course, she and Regis and Kathy Lee hated each other too, from her agreed.

[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:53.860]
And of course, who wouldn't hate Kathy Lee?

[00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:55.460]
Probably jealous of Kathy Lee's boobs.

[00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:56.520]
Is that it?

[00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:58.240]
Or is he's a joy forever?

[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:01.940]
Suspicious package of White House grounds, the president is not there.

[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:03.720]
Ooh, bite your lip.

[00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:04.600]
Very, very hard.

[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:05.020]
Or the blood.

[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:07.040]
I got pepperoni juice tricking down my chin.

[00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:09.320]
Yes, I think it's pepperoni juice.

[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:13.600]
You know, being outdoors a lot in South Florida really need comfortable shoes to be

[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:14.200]
schlepping around.

[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:16.880]
So they only place to go as brandy shoes in pop and obiates.

[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:21.340]
They carry all the major brands like Floreshime, Echo, Mephisto, Rockport, Hushpuppey's, New

[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:25.440]
Balance, and tons of other big-name brands in all sizes for men and women, even they

[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:29.120]
carry a wide width and hard to find sizes too, if you've got strange feet.

[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:32.420]
Brandy shoes is the largest impending true retailer in South Florida.

[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:35.300]
And when you see the selection venue, you get a brandy's you'll see why I've been telling

[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.280]
you about them for years.

[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:39.720]
Go see my good friend Arnie who gets the right fitting shoes for your feet.

[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:43.040]
Brandy's isn't like a department store where you have to wait a long time to get service,

[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.300]
then they tell you, oh, guess what?

[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:45.740]
We don't have that style in your size.

[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:47.660]
The only thing they do with brandy is the shoes.

[00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:51.240]
Obviously, they know their stuff and you never have to worry about size, selection or

[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:51.580]
service.

[00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:56.160]
Brandy shoes you'll find in the 1290 North Federal Highway in pop and obiates between Atlantic

[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.380]
and Copens on the east side, you can't miss it.

[00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:02.060]
Brandy's open daily Monday through Saturday till 9 and every Sunday till 5.

[00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:04.020]
And this week is a great time to buy men's shoes.

[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:08.780]
If your size 14 and over at Brandy's, take 10 bucks off on all men's brands and,

[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:12.660]
why do they check out their men's and women's hush puppies on sale at 20% off this week.

[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.600]
Always extra savings, always great deals and really friendly sales holes who know your

[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:18.140]
feet inside and out even by the smell.

[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:22.820]
So be sure to come into Brandy's this week or shop on their website, brandy's shoes.com.

[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.220]
This is Neil Rogers.

[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:29.620]
This is 5.16 Q.A.A.

[00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:33.800]
Congratulations, get a life.

[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:13.240]
I'm going to go to the top secret prison or any get most ever enough to trace them.

[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:14.820]
It's too too.

[00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:19.600]
Raise our kids under how to rest.

[00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:25.640]
Get all men's after one protest and take their music when they leave that district.

[00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:26.460]
Go!

[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:29.220]
Where's the left wingers?

[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:29.700]
Go!

[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:34.840]
What are you going to do about it?

[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:35.540]
You failed!

[00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:38.500]
1117 at 5.60.

[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:40.240]
That's your whole lot of use.

[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:42.480]
What are you going to do about it?

[00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:44.780]
Everywhere, doesn't it?

[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:45.680]
It's just everywhere.

[00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:47.360]
Okay, relax.

[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:50.020]
Just have any votes.

[00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:51.540]
What do you think Josh, doesn't they or not?

[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:52.420]
I don't think he's out of the room.

[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:59.200]
What do you mean he's out of the room?

[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:02.360]
Maybe he's confagulating with the new sales manager to see what's going on.

[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:03.220]
Maybe what to find.

[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:04.200]
What's his name?

[00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:04.880]
Pryce Rampford.

[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:06.060]
Old lady, skinhead.

[00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:07.620]
I don't know.

[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:08.460]
Body was diabetic.

[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:09.700]
That's supposed to be a big secret.

[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:10.980]
Pryce Rampford's diabetic.

[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:12.440]
I don't think it's supposed to be a secret.

[00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:14.740]
I don't think anybody would keep it a secret like a Humper.

[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:18.260]
Listen, as far as it goes, Eric did a beautiful job on our website.

[00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:20.360]
I run another poll on it.

[00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:23.620]
Veeamfields, pasta, low carb.

[00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:25.860]
But I do want to emphasize this.

[00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:28.420]
And make sure you mark it down the time I send this very carefully.

[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.720]
If you're one of those diabetic people that doesn't take your blood sugar,

[00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:32.880]
first of all, you're crazy.

[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:33.960]
You're crazy.

[00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:35.340]
You've got to get this.

[00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:35.860]
You're an Ielunatic.

[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:37.540]
That was fun.

[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:38.200]
That's number one.

[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.840]
And number two, don't eat this.

[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:40.580]
Don't order it.

[00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:41.040]
Don't eat it.

[00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:41.500]
Don't buy it.

[00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:43.480]
I got enough of it to sink a battleship.

[00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:47.260]
So as we're going down like the Titanic, it'll be perfect.

[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:48.100]
It'll fit right in.

[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:50.580]
Veeamfields, low carb pasta.

[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.960]
Eric did nice all the artwork there.

[00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:55.260]
It's got the picture of the box and their logo and the link to read more about it.

[00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:57.900]
And that's it.

[00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:00.120]
But if you don't take your blood sugar, don't take it.

[00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:03.480]
Because obviously, the fact I'm having a real good luck with it and I've lost five pounds

[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:04.440]
and it's very satisfying.

[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:09.320]
And it's also taken away my sugar craving, which, to me, is a miracle.

[00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:10.480]
A miracle.

[00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:11.980]
Can you believe it?

[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:12.600]
I believe it.

[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:13.660]
I think I mean, I know.

[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:16.680]
For some things in life, you just can't believe it ever lose your craving for.

[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:18.000]
Like what?

[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:19.360]
Like that.

[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:21.140]
Something sweet.

[00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:22.280]
Yeah?

[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:23.340]
Like, yeah.

[00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:25.080]
Apple pie.

[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:25.480]
Apple pie.

[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:27.020]
Like chocolate cream pie.

[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:28.660]
Or banana cream pie.

[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:29.980]
No interest.

[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:31.000]
No interest.

[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:31.800]
No ice cream.

[00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:32.860]
No, no, no.

[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:33.380]
That garbage.

[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:34.340]
It's a miracle.

[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:35.600]
I survived this long.

[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:38.320]
Eat nice cream by the like the half gallon at times.

[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:39.480]
Take me to your two liter.

[00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:44.340]
Nestleys turtle and all that Ben and Jerry's coffee toffee crunch.

[00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:46.820]
And then I got hooked on it.

[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:49.080]
They're amogin' does of all things that banana nut.

[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.240]
What is nothing like a banana nut?

[00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:54.480]
Green doubts his flying into a building.

[00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:55.220]
Who could imagine?

[00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:56.780]
Three little words.

[00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:57.800]
Still employed there.

[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:02.420]
Of all the through the looking glass moments in the last few days the strangest is this.

[00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:08.160]
The FBI officer who arrested and questioned Zacharias Musawi, or Zakaryus, told a jury that

[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:13.420]
he had alerted his superior about 70 times that Mr. Musawi is a radical Islamic fundamentalist

[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:15.740]
who hated America might be plotting the hijack in her plane.

[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:16.500]
70?

[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:19.980]
That makes one time for every virgin waiting for Mr. Musawi in heaven.

[00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:24.300]
Judging by how disastrous the prosecution is doing, the virgins will have to wait.

[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:28.580]
We could have cracked the 911 plot if the FBI wasn't run by Dunc's.

[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.440]
Mr. Musawi's lawyers got a break because according to the testimony of the officer Harry

[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:36.760]
Samet, a better run bureau could have broken the case even without the terrorist confession.

[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.580]
Maybe the FBI officer should have shot him with some paintballs.

[00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:45.020]
On September 10, 2001 Mr. Samet confided to a colleague that he was desperate to get into

[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:45.920]
Mr. Musawi's computer.

[00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:48.760]
He never heard back from the FBI's bin Laden unit before 911.

[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:52.000]
What did the unit have to do that was more pressing than catching bin Laden?

[00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:56.760]
And he was instructed by officials in FBI headquarters here whom he labeled criminally negligent.

[00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:01.380]
He named two of the officials who didn't want to endanger their careers with any excess aggression

[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:06.060]
toward radical fundamentalists, David Frasca, and Michael Malfi, then working on the radical

[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:06.940]
fundamentalist unit.

[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:09.500]
So that David Frasca makes a hell of a drink.

[00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:13.900]
Even though Condi Ristro, the 911 commissioner, no one could have imagined terrorist slumming

[00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:16.560]
him to a plane on the World Trade Center, and FBI officer did.

[00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:21.140]
Officer Samet testified that a colleague, Greg Jones, tried to light a fire under Mr. Malfi,

[00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:24.980]
by urging him to prevent Zekar Ristro from flying a plane into the World Trade Center.

[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:25.660]
Those words.

[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:29.460]
Later, Mr. Jones told Samet that it had been just been a lucky guess.

[00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:31.680]
Uh-huh.

[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:35.860]
Kenneth Williams, a Phoenix agent, also sent a warning memory to the flagmatic Mr. Frasca

[00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:41.300]
in July 2001 after sniffing out a scheme by Osama to dispass Middle East extremist

[00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:42.420]
America to get flight training.

[00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:47.040]
Neil Lewis wrote on the Times yesterday that William Carter, an FBI spokesman, said that

[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:50.320]
neither the bureau nor Mr. Malfi nor Mr. Frasca, who are still employed there, would have

[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:50.840]
any comment.

[00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:52.200]
Still employed there?

[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:55.480]
How can Mr. Malfi and Mr. Frasca still be employed at the FBI?

[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:57.940]
How can Michael Shudoff still be employed in Homeland Security?

[00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:00.820]
How can Donald Rumsfeld still be employed at Pentagon?

[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:06.480]
Missing 911, missing Katrina, mangling a rack, racking up $9 trillion in debt, those things

[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:10.120]
don't cause officials to lose their jobs, only saying something honest as pressure in

[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:13.520]
general Eric's situation, so he did, can get you a one-way ticket to Volucaville.

[00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:18.740]
Rummy told reporters last week that the military was preparing for a civil war in Iraq, but

[00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:21.740]
he didn't consider it a civil war yet, even though he acknowledged it was hard to tell

[00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:23.620]
exactly when chaos took into civil war.

[00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:27.540]
I don't think it looked like the United States civil war he had had sang willingly.

[00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:31.760]
Yeah, at Fort Sumter Lincoln left the enemy fire first, so the French Secretary believes

[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:36.080]
that the body counts days below the civil war era's 600,000 Iraq will achieve a healthy

[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:37.380]
blue state red state democracy.

[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:42.200]
One administration official says that Rummy doesn't hold the same sway in meetings anymore

[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:46.460]
that he's treated as an eccentric old uncle who pops off and is ignored, but why can't

[00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:47.320]
W. Just quit him?

[00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:51.900]
Instead, the president praised him for doing a fine job on two wars and transforming the

[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:55.240]
military when Rummy actually bullied the military to go along with his full-less schemes

[00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:58.580]
in Iraq and has sapped the one-spirit fighting machine, that machine.

[00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:01.760]
That is impromptu press conference yesterday.

[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:06.580]
The president presented himself as an ice guy doing a difficult job relentlessly joshing

[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:07.180]
with reporters.

[00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:10.900]
He chided the press for playing in service goals by showing bad news from Iraq.

[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:14.760]
They're capable of blowing up innocent lives so it ends up on your TV show, even as

[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:19.400]
reports surfaced about insurgents outside Baghdad, storming a jail, slaughtering 18 police officers,

[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:23.240]
and letting the prisoners out following fast upon an insurgent raid on Iraqi army headquarters

[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:23.820]
and care cook.

[00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:28.020]
Does the president think TV will instead report on an increase in melanchiles at the market?

[00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:33.060]
When the Bushies harp on training Iraqi security forces so America can hand the country over

[00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:34.280]
to them, it has a hollow ring.

[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:36.900]
Back in 2003 the U.S.

[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:40.560]
The Batfield, Iraq, and put its faith in its friends, the Shiites.

[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.160]
The bathified Iraq.

[00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:44.280]
What do I say?

[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:45.020]
Whatever I said.

[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:49.540]
Now given the suspected Shiite death squads and militias, the U.S. wants to bring the

[00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:52.300]
Sunis back into the system so whom do we trust in for how long?

[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:56.680]
As to take an envision a day when there would be no more U.S. forces in Iraq than the president

[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:58.600]
said, that of course is unobjective.

[00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:02.500]
For the end of that it would be decided by future Iraqi governments and future American presidents.

[00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:06.260]
Once W is not still employed there, says Maureen, the queen.

[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:10.520]
Maureen Dowd, you don't have no Adam Zafl and she sure is how long I have no aspiratus.

[00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:13.940]
Oh, here's some big radio news.

[00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:18.080]
The station that you never heard of before in our guarantee, I'll bet you a Joe Bell's

[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:20.140]
life on it that Josh never heard of it.

[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:23.140]
Union radio at W.O.C.N.

[00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:23.920]
No speaking English.

[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:26.180]
Oh, that's perfect.

[00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:26.960]
Yeah.

[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:28.220]
Sold for $6 million.

[00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:29.040]
$10 million.

[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:30.520]
W.O.C.N.

[00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:34.880]
Mine has been sold by minority broadcasters headed by Richard and Pablo Vega to Dallas-based

[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:36.620]
Independence Media for a six million bucks.

[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:38.000]
W.O.C.N.

[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:41.340]
Coeuranyl airs a mix of broker, talk and religious programs targeting immigrants from Latin

[00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:42.680]
America and Haiti-Mond.

[00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:45.400]
The station's signal covers the county most of Broward.

[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:49.120]
John Pierce was the exclusive broker in this transaction, according to radio and records,

[00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:49.840]
R and R.

[00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:52.540]
Always keep my thumb on it.

[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:56.240]
You know, FMQB and R and R, all these are radio, all these are radio related sites.

[00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:58.320]
In case it might be some real good jobs.

[00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:01.160]
I think I'm going to go to work at W.O.C.N. and put those vatures on the map.

[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.660]
And it will let you translate into Esponial.

[00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:08.520]
And Josh can do the Amarlin's games in whatever language he speaks.

[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:09.060]
C.C.

[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:09.320]

[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:11.020]
See this?

[00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:12.240]
Wow.

[00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:15.300]
699 votes if I refresh it.

[00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:16.580]
It's going to be over 700, you think?

[00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:17.160]
I'm refreshing.

[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:17.700]
I'm clicking.

[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:18.540]
It's 700.

[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:19.540]
All right.

[00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:22.740]
It's the 700 club with Pat Neill Robertson.

[00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:25.560]
Which of Neill's comments piss you off the most?

[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:27.180]
That's our very good poll question today.

[00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:28.100]
None of them.

[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:31.100]
None, 83% are not PO'd.

[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:32.240]
P'd off.

[00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:33.380]
582.

[00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:35.180]
Ever been P'd off?

[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:40.840]
His comments about politics, 28, his comments about religion, 23, about blacks, 22, about

[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:43.020]
guns, 22, how about blacks with guns?

[00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:45.080]
Bad mix, baby, a bad combination.

[00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:45.960]
Lethal.

[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:52.540]
His comments about Cubans, 8, his comments about Orthodox Jews, 8, well too bad.

[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:55.760]
You get keys and put away them stupid hats.

[00:45:56.440 --> 00:46:00.680]
His comments about callers 4 and his comments about rednecks, Solomon T. Trace, only 3.

[00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:02.080]
So I told you we didn't have to put that on it.

[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:03.420]
That's why Eric probably left it off.

[00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:04.900]
Maybe it was just an oversight.

[00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:09.820]
Maybe he was busy putting up that big guy thing about the Greenfield pasta, which he did an excellent job.

[00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:10.440]
Yes, he did.

[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:11.600]
I'll tell you one thing.

[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:14.560]
The other said this about 10 cases of it, just for the free publicity.

[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:16.900]
Where is that copy from Steve Olf at Pompadot Park?

[00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:18.460]
Did what's his name for?

[00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:20.460]
I start everyone running in there and say, hey, here's a spot?

[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:23.840]
Yeah, see, doesn't care.

[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:24.820]
Doesn't care.

[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:27.520]
I just like a certain other place that my mom mentioned in the pizza lot.

[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:34.060]
Just like other accounts that I've had on here for years and years and years since we're supposedly all whipped up about celebrating my 30th anniversary.

[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.060]
I'm sorry, man.

[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:35.720]
And this market.

[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:40.140]
You'll see, it's just a matter of time before they run everybody else off too.

[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:43.500]
Because this sales department is these are the sales holes from the hell.

[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:44.480]
From the hell.

[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:46.760]
It's unbelievable, man.

[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:47.520]
They just...

[00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:48.800]
They're unbelievable.

[00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:50.080]
Including your buddy Duff.

[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:51.100]
Oh, my God.

[00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:52.160]
Hey, Duff.

[00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:53.620]
I don't care who you are.

[00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:54.540]
You're fairy.

[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:55.920]
God, that's a real...

[00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:56.920]
And you're in your witness.

[00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:59.380]
Was Josh in there yesterday when he was giving me that song at a dance?

[00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:00.040]
I was.

[00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:03.180]
And were you in there the previous time last week when he saw me just the opposite?

[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:04.560]
Yes, I was.

[00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:05.080]
Yeah.

[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:06.820]
So what am I supposed to believe?

[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:07.840]
What do I know?

[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:08.720]
Who did Moe?

[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:09.280]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:11.560]
I just don't get it.

[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:15.880]
We can't get an honest answer from any of these people for love, money, or anything.

[00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:19.620]
I think Josh might know something that gives Duff the given honest answer.

[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:21.960]
Has something to do with that?

[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:24.840]
But I don't think he's a viner or so on that.

[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:25.440]
That's your department.

[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:26.240]
Attention, man.

[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:27.680]
No, it's not my department.

[00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:29.000]
That's Duff's department.

[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:29.360]
Okay?

[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:31.220]
Like I said, Duff.

[00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:32.380]
I don't care who you are.

[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:33.320]
You're fairy.

[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:33.620]
God.

[00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:37.800]
You know, I could understand it if he had like about a half a dozen accounts.

[00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:39.260]
I'm a show.

[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:40.280]
I could understand that.

[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:42.340]
But there is Solomon Teuno, baby.

[00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:43.200]
There's one.

[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:46.680]
A very good one, by the way, an excellent one, which you guys want to keep getting the free food.

[00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:49.240]
But it's like, I can't get a straight answer out of this guy.

[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:50.240]
Wow.

[00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:52.700]
I got the right answer.

[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:55.620]
That was a bad choice that we're just straight answer.

[00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:56.400]
You're fair.

[00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:57.140]
Sorry about that.

[00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:57.860]
I didn't answer that.

[00:47:57.900 --> 00:47:59.020]
That's right about Andrew Ascender Woods.

[00:47:59.140 --> 00:47:59.280]
Oh.

[00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:00.340]
What a little later.

[00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:02.180]
27.

[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:04.080]
Oh.

[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:05.440]
Wow.

[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:08.660]
And of course, this is the macho sports station, right?

[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.860]
Like that one jingle by a Bokobrow.

[00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:14.080]
Where is it?

[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:15.720]
I'll find it.

[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:16.660]
In fact, I played it before.

[00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:18.280]
This one.

[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:21.140]
Sports, we are radio.

[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:23.200]
Let the Q-ray.

[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:25.460]
Make no mistake about it, baby.

[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:27.640]
It's your game.

[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:28.900]
Station for the new millennium.

[00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:31.140]
28, that's why we're going down.

[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:32.860]
28 past 11, a Q-A.

[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:34.180]
You all know the name dry concepts.

[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:35.120]
There's another one, even.

[00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:37.180]
I was with me for 21 years on here.

[00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:38.780]
And I've used them in my home for all that time.

[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:40.600]
They were just at my house a week ago on Monday.

[00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:43.600]
Doing their fine, fantastic, usual, amazing job.

[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:46.120]
You can have the worst looking schmootsiest carpets in the world,

[00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:47.580]
which back at IOD, remember that day?

[00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:48.080]
I'm sure you do.

[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:48.380]
Yes.

[00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:51.060]
I mean, those carpets had been cleaned about 400 years,

[00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:53.120]
since before Jesus was an infant.

[00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:56.400]
And right downstairs there, right where Gary Osses name was,

[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:58.640]
the accountant's name, Gary Mills.

[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:00.000]
Mills, very good.

[00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:00.920]
Who, man?

[00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:03.240]
I wonder if he was kind of the hardest driver, Gary Mills.

[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:03.660]
Who?

[00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:05.340]
Off the Canadian Circuit.

[00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:07.780]
Anyway, they came and cleaned those carpets,

[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:08.840]
and they made them look sensational.

[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:11.120]
And those were as desperate as it gets.

[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:13.780]
So no matter what the deal is, before you go out and spend thousands

[00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:16.100]
of replace your carpeting, give dry concepts a call.

[00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:18.320]
And let them bring even the dirtiest carpets back to life,

[00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:19.280]
looking just like brand new.

[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:21.500]
They leave your carpets vibrant in color, soft to the touch,

[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:24.960]

This is Neil Rogers.

[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:26.520]
This is 5-16-Q-A-T.

[00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:32.020]
Aight, coming soon to Fox.

[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:37.060]
It's the all-new Beverly Hill Millies, starring all your favorite characters, Jay.

[00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:38.640]
We went in Green Grant Granny.

[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:39.160]
Carpet!

[00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:40.020]
Chetro.

[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:40.760]
Dog.

[00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:42.700]
And Kelly Pickler.

[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:43.900]
What's the sale, man?

[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:47.440]
I don't tell you, she demonstrates what life is like without a brain.

[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:49.160]
You want a hand with me?

[00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:51.660]
Thank you, but I don't even know how to dance.

[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:54.060]
What a determined agency, though.

[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:56.560]
A...

[00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:00.360]
What have I done to deserve this?

[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:03.060]
You know her and love her from American Idol.

[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:06.940]
Now follow Kelly Pickler as she makes a startling discovery.

[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:11.900]
I should love it here in California, but I went to this place called Holywood.

[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:14.620]
And I don't see no churches at all.

[00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:16.560]
I don't realize, Hittin' Love.

[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:20.060]
It's the all-new Beverly Hill Millies, starring Kelly Pickler.

[00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:21.560]
What's the heel bear?

[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:22.860]
I'm coming soon to climb.

[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:23.720]
I'm coming.

[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:25.420]
I'll come back.

[00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:28.140]
I had to find that much more amusing if I knew who Kelly Pickler was.

[00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:29.840]
You know who that is?

[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:30.180]
Nope.

[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:32.040]
Somebody from American Idol, I guess.

[00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:33.160]
One of those stupid ass shows.

[00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:34.580]
Is that who that is, Josh?

[00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:36.580]
Oh, yeah, I watch that show all the time.

[00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:39.680]
Well, I mean, you're supposed to know your Pickler's, Mr. Kelly Pickler.

[00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:40.440]
You better Google it.

[00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:41.400]
I have no idea who that is.

[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:44.020]
It was kind of a cute bit, because George likes Beverly Hill Millies a lot.

[00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:45.420]
You know, I'll come back now, you hear?

[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:46.620]
You would've if you'd ever watched it.

[00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:48.260]
No, I did watch him and suck.

[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:51.920]
It was almost as good as Avigabor and Morsegelen, Green Acres.

[00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:52.720]
So, let's see.

[00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:53.560]
You already did it all.

[00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:55.780]
Yeah, she was a contesting.

[00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:57.040]
I don't know who that is.

[00:51:57.140 --> 00:51:57.740]
On American Idol.

[00:51:58.020 --> 00:51:58.320]
That's right.

[00:51:58.680 --> 00:51:59.260]
On Eric Idol.

[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:00.120]
What's the deal with her?

[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:00.540]
What's the deal with her?

[00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:00.940]
I don't get it.

[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:02.440]
No, that was on the bit.

[00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:03.040]
I don't know.

[00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:04.080]
Can you listen to it?

[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:04.940]
I'll play it again if you want.

[00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:06.280]
I'm a Wilson Good Time player right now.

[00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:09.640]
Howard Faxson says, I wonder which Howard that is.

[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:10.520]
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

[00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:13.140]
I listen to you show every day and listen to many of your suggestions.

[00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:15.940]
Yes, today, you were talking about Dreamfield Pasta.

[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:16.220]
Yes.

[00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:18.840]
I have to say this is an excellent pasta and very good carb-wise.

[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:20.420]
Thank you for keeping your audience informed.

[00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:21.380]
And you're welcome, Howard.

[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:22.700]
Thanks for the nice facts.

[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:23.420]
I like that.

[00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:24.520]
Short and sweet, right to the point.

[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:25.360]
How are you?

[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:26.240]
I was paying attention.

[00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:28.480]
Now, what's that final total?

[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:31.820]
I mean, not final, but I mean close to final for that fundraising thing

[00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:32.940]
that the duck forced on us.

[00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:37.320]
We had 19,935 as of, I don't know, some time.

[00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:38.420]
I haven't got any weight.

[00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:39.500]
A total today.

[00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:40.460]
Well, what?

[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:42.260]
I haven't gotten a total today.

[00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:42.720]
Well, why not?

[00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:42.940]
I don't know.

[00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:43.940]
I really won't because I don't know.

[00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:45.920]
Because Miguel's like screwing off again today.

[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:46.500]
Or something.

[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:48.320]
Oh, screwing somebody.

[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:49.200]
Come on.

[00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:50.200]
Let's get rid of it.

[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:52.660]
Boy, why did we get involved in that?

[00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:53.180]
It's your fault.

[00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:56.320]
You should have said to me, you should have said to me, no circumstances.

[00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:57.620]
You were right there.

[00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:59.040]
You were in another year.

[00:52:59.820 --> 00:53:00.340]
Every year.

[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:01.600]
What did I say?

[00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:02.380]
What was my answer?

[00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:04.100]
What was my answer?

[00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:06.300]
When I first brought up this project, what was your final answer?

[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:07.780]
Final answer was, which is the final answer.

[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:09.040]
Final answer is, you go and every just crap again.

[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:09.560]
Yeah.

[00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:12.120]
I just like having to bank the money he's made the last five years.

[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:13.220]
Oh, last five minutes.

[00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:14.400]
Oh, brother.

[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:18.040]
I mean, you know, don't take this wrong even though he's a big-noter game nut.

[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:19.860]
But I like Regis Elias, a good guy.

[00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:26.240]
But that having been said for a guy with his talent to be making that kind of money, you know?

[00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:28.060]
I mean, people talk about the money I'm making.

[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:31.080]
Regis makes more money in two minutes than I make in five years.

[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:35.740]
Okay, he's just swimming in a sea of money, drowning in it.

[00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:41.280]
Between that, who wants to be a millionaire and at the awful show with Kelly Ripper and formerly with Kathy Lee

[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:44.380]
and all the, and I, and then of course, those commercials he's doing.

[00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:46.480]
He's got endorsements up the old earlobe.

[00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:47.860]
My God.

[00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:49.480]
And I don't be graduate at all.

[00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:55.900]
But you've got to admit for a guy with his talent to be making that kind of money, he ought to be kissing the Blarney Stone every chance he gets.

[00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:56.480]
I sure do.

[00:53:57.580 --> 00:53:58.740]
I kiss the old Blarney Stone.

[00:53:58.900 --> 00:53:59.560]
Is that what you call it?

[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:00.200]
Yes.

[00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:04.280]
Oh, here's our one-lowly call, WQAM.

[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:06.120]
I said, the old guy.

[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:06.920]
Yes, sir.

[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:08.500]
I'm very concerned with Kelly.

[00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:14.580]
Pickler is she is on American Idol and she's a little blonde, hotty and country girl.

[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:16.720]
But she's just dumb and dirt.

[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:20.320]
Like Jessica Simpson, blonde, uh, Bimbo, Dumbo.

[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:21.040]
Exactly.

[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:24.420]
She's just so cute and you want to get past it, but it's just so tough.

[00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:26.500]
Keep it up.

[00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:28.040]
Okay, thanks, Charlie.

[00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:29.460]
Yeah, I know what people like that.

[00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:30.440]
CBD.

[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:32.400]
Cupid dumb.

[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:36.180]
Where's the old saying goes, young and dumb and full of fun.

[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:37.720]
Something fun.

[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:40.200]
You better watch it, Mr. Joyce.

[00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:41.820]
It's going to be all over your ass, man.

[00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:42.740]
I've never been fine.

[00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:45.000]
You're going to be all over your ass.

[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:46.040]
You're going to be Schmier-Renian.

[00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:49.300]
WQAM, hello.

[00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:52.720]
Twist and Turban, Turban, Twist.

[00:54:57.120 --> 00:55:00.460]
I'd like to have that Jack S. come up here and say that to one of my cad drivers.

[00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:01.140]
Twist this.

[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:03.800]
Even Charlie Checker likes to twist your head right off.

[00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:05.060]
If it would do any good.

[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:07.920]
WQAM, hello.

[00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:09.460]
Hello, Neil.

[00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:10.240]
Yes.

[00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:15.340]
I just like to say, Phil Faltzman is the worst karaoke singer I've ever heard in my life.

[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:18.060]
No, please don't tell me Phil Saltzman's really doing karaoke, please.

[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:18.980]
Yes, sir.

[00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:22.380]
I was at a restaurant and he jumped on stage and it was horrible.

[00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:23.540]
Wow.

[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:24.040]
Wow.

[00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:25.660]
That's pretty scary thought.

[00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:26.680]
Thanks for the bad news.

[00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:27.220]
Come on, Phil.

[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:28.100]
Come back to your senses.

[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:28.900]
Senses.

[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:30.120]
Wow.

[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:31.380]
Good guy, though, Phil Saltzman.

[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:34.500]
These are race call are not certainly the best, but good guy.

[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:36.160]
Certainly not better than Mike Pataglia.

[00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:42.840]
On the outside, oh brother, he is, you know, see the thing with Hank discussing any of the people in the sports fraternity.

[00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:45.060]
It's like discussing diving with Hank.

[00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:46.820]
There are just certain type of stuff that you're clear from.

[00:55:47.060 --> 00:55:48.520]
You should intercede and warn me.

[00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:49.540]
Remind me.

[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:50.280]
Okay.

[00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:53.760]
He just says, you can't discuss the thing with some people.

[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:54.400]
I know that.

[00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:57.480]
And it's just like he's part of that sports fraternity.

[00:55:57.480 --> 00:56:00.180]
He's buddies with all these people, even the losers, like Mike Pataglia.

[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:02.140]
So bring anything like that up.

[00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:03.060]
He just wants to defend.

[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:04.900]
And that's why we realize that.

[00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:05.580]
I like him a lot.

[00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:07.380]
It's too bad he doesn't take his blood sugar.

[00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:09.820]
Somebody QAM, hello.

[00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:15.340]
Oh, you could done better than that.

[00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:16.360]
That was too short.

[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:18.800]
You hit a short one like that.

[00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:19.640]
All the time.

[00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:21.040]
Line nine.

[00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:23.580]
Any line.

[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:24.680]
No, not the Raspberry line.

[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:26.200]
That was supposed to be on line one.

[00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:28.580]
56670560.

[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:28.900]
Come on.

[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:29.680]
You guys can do it.

[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:30.520]
I can smell it.

[00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:32.160]
I could tell it's Wednesday.

[00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:32.860]
It's the middle of the week.

[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:35.080]
It's Humpty, like some really moronic people say.

[00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:37.480]
It's a day for a Zinion calls.

[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:38.720]
I got a huge pile here.

[00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:41.880]
By the way, I got a pile like up the nose.

[00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:44.700]
Here it.

[00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:45.640]
I heard it.

[00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:46.560]
Come in to QAM.

[00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:46.760]
Hello.

[00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:52.640]
New reports assist you with tracking tasks for all your files in the reports module.

[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:57.060]
To learn more about these new features, contact your fund, sales representative.

[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:02.120]
We shouldn't need this on to a client.

[00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:03.920]
Why is it always the same sort of thing?

[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:05.580]
Is it?

[00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:08.140]
It's always her voice.

[00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:09.940]
Did you see, we talked about that way a year ago.

[00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:11.560]
Remember they showed that the chick right?

[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:15.500]
She does all the stuff in her basement and she's on all these messages.

[00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:17.820]
She records them in her basement.

[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:18.580]
She's got a studio.

[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:19.560]
I mean, that's really something.

[00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:23.020]
People that have a studio right in their own home that can work out of their own bed.

[00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:23.300]

[00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:23.920]
They're without leaving.

[00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:27.040]
They're like, hop out of bed in the morning and walk about 10 feet in the room.

[00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:27.500]
Or there's two doors.

[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:28.500]
They're fed as well.

[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:29.260]
Like I'm doing right now.

[00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:30.720]
I want to box the shorts and teach her.

[00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:32.240]
I have a teacher when it's just cool.

[00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:33.240]
Man, all of a sun is out.

[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.740]
Holy, I just noticed it's a blue skies.

[00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:36.920]
Sun is out.

[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:38.540]
Let's give that weather report for Castronova.

[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:40.560]
Sun and 32.

[00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:44.640]
All of a sudden, it'll be 38 tomorrow, 40 tomorrow and Friday.

[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:45.360]
41.

[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:45.980]
Oh, there's you.

[00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:47.100]
In a GPA.

[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:47.740]
In a GPA.

[00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:49.840]
Oh, she sends me right to the board.

[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.080]
Wait until you hear it.

[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:54.680]
No significant changes from day to day in the forecast.

[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:55.800]
Oh, sure.

[00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:56.740]
Did you have any conditions?

[00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:57.620]
Is that where she's from?

[00:57:58.100 --> 00:57:58.600]
Friday in the summer.

[00:57:58.940 --> 00:57:59.040]
Yes.

[00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:00.160]
Well, some sunny breaks.

[00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:01.220]
The deep blue like it.

[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:02.660]
I'm sure it's a chance each day of summer.

[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:03.700]
Oh, I see everybody.

[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:05.220]
I know just there again.

[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:05.760]
I'm just here.

[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:06.160]
I'm just here.

[00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:10.880]
But as we head into Sunday, we'll see significantly more sunshine.

[00:58:10.980 --> 00:58:11.880]
Many sunny skies.

[00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:12.920]
I expect a first-gen.

[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:15.560]
And we're looking at a high of five degrees for a Sunday.

[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:17.220]
And that is a Sunday.

[00:58:17.220 --> 00:58:19.280]
I think it's a high of the time of the year.

[00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:21.220]
So why do we can wish it beyond pop?

[00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:22.320]
Oh, damn it.

[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:23.120]
She didn't say GTA.

[00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:23.800]
Oh, well, anyway.

[00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:26.000]
You can make that a regular feat or something.

[00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:28.460]
Wow.

[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:31.700]
And she is one thing people would hate this city if they don't like foreigners,

[00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:34.340]
because everybody here basically is a foreigner, like me.

[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:35.700]
That was just so great.

[00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:38.840]
I'm sure they're still talking about that suspicious package on the White House ground.

[00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:43.060]
I had to bring in people as well from, and they're during the Washington DC,

[00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:44.300]
the heart of the nation's capital.

[00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:45.780]
They have the president's not there, though.

[00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:46.520]
Be afraid.

[00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:46.980]
The federal.

[00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:47.940]
Get very afraid.

[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:48.320]
Right.

[00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:50.420]
The agency's available to them at just a moment notice.

[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:54.240]
So for your many years at the White House, John, not not a typical day at the office,

[00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:56.280]
but probably more days like this than you could see.

[00:58:56.300 --> 00:58:59.720]
You notice John Roberts now is on CNN because they got screwed over with CBS.

[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:00.480]
Nice going, John.

[00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:01.340]
He's a good news guy.

[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.100]
With that kind of like salt and pepper hair.

[00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:06.380]
He's a mature-looking guy.

[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:07.700]
He looks good on camera.

[00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:08.460]
He's been here for years.

[00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:09.900]
He's a good Canadian boy, by the way.

[00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:10.640]
I believe John Roberts.

[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:11.180]
Never heard of him.

[00:59:11.220 --> 00:59:11.800]
Yes, he is.

[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:12.100]
Huh?

[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:12.860]
Never heard of him.

[00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:14.000]
Yeah, you did.

[00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:15.860]
He used to fill in for Dan rather all the time.

[00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:16.840]
What are you talking about?

[00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:17.880]
You, you communist.

[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:18.820]
Dan who?

[00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:20.140]
Right.

[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:23.420]
I'm going to throw up in my throat a little bit in my mouth.

[00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:24.440]
I'm going to stop him.

[00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:24.860]
Yeah, there you go.

[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:26.660]
Gosh, put it out.

[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:30.900]
He should have been the enough at Old Oki-Doki-Bob Sheifer, and so now John Roberts jumps

[00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:31.200]
to his room.

[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:33.380]
He's over there on CNN, along with his an Nazis.

[00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:35.520]
Feach Ford is gone mad.

[00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:36.800]
It's madness in March.

[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:40.580]
See, we would've said March madness, but let's say, copyrighted the phrase we can say that.

[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:40.980]
That's right.

[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:43.740]
So it's madness in March all this month at Feach Ford.

[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:47.580]
They dismissed having a record month in February, so they're going to break that record to pieces

[00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:48.040]
this month.

[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:48.640]
They're going to blake it.

[00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:53.720]
And right now, Standard Camp Ford F-150s, there was always just $249 a month with $9.95

[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:56.260]
down plus fees with a pro-credit in 39-month lease.

[00:59:57.020 --> 00:59:59.640]
Madness in March at Feach Ford means you must be mad.

[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:02.020]
You've got to be crazy enough to take advantage of deals like these.

[01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:05.480]
Rebeats and discounts have up to $10,000 on all new and used vehicles.

[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:08.800]
Now, if you're not in the market for a new car, but you know anybody who would have sent

[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:11.500]
them into Feach Ford because if they take liberty this month through the month of March,

[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:14.600]
Feach Ford will send you $200 in cash just for sending them by.

[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:18.260]
And like I always tell you, the money comes from their advertising budgets so they won't

[01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:21.760]
tack it onto your friends' price and repay them over hurray or it off, is if you cared.

[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:22.740]
Don't miss out on this.

[01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:27.140]
Once the event, its Feach Ford's madness in March, a Standard Camp Ford F-150s, lowest

[01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:31.500]
$249 a month, discounts and rebates up to $10 grand and $200 just for referring your

[01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:31.780]
friend.

[01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:36.060]
So, Hurray and Feach Ford is located two miles east of the Golden Glades on 160th Street,

[01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:36.800]
Westix, the highway.

[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.720]
Don't ask for Paul by the way he ain't there no more.

[01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:41.240]
I guarantee it though, you'll love your Feach Ford experience.

[01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:43.740]
This is Neil Rogers.

[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:46.500]
This is a Gold Gold Gold.

[01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:47.740]
This is a Gold Gold Gold.

[01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:48.360]
This is a Gold Gold Gold.

[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:49.860]
This is a Gold Gold Gold.

[01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:51.400]
This is a Gold Gold.

[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:51.400]

[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:51.400]

[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:51.400]

[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:51.400]

[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:51.400]

[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:51.400]

[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:51.700]
This is a Gold Gold.

[01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:51.700]

[01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:51.700]

[01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:52.200]
This is a Gold Gold.

[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:52.340]

[01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:53.440]
This is a Gold Gold.

[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:53.820]
This is a Gold Gold.

[01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:55.120]
This is a Gold Gold.

[01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:58.720]
This is a Gold Gold.

[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:01.360]
This is a Gold Gold.

[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:06.780]
This is a Gold Gold.

[01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:35.320]
This is a Gold Gold.

[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:36.080]

[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:36.080]

[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:36.080]

[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:36.080]

[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:36.080]

[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:36.080]

[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:36.080]

[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:36.080]

[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:36.080]

[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:36.080]

[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:36.080]

[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:36.080]

[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:36.080]

[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:36.080]

[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:36.120]
This is a Gold Gold.

[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:36.480]
This is a Gold Gold.

[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:36.480]

[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:36.480]

[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:36.480]

[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:36.480]

[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:36.480]

[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:36.560]
This is a Gold Gold.

[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:36.760]
This is a Gold Gold.

[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:36.760]

[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:36.760]

[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:36.760]

[01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:49.140]
This is a Gold Gold.

[01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:53.300]
This is a Gold Gold.

[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:53.300]

[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:53.300]

[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:53.300]

[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:53.300]

[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:53.300]

[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:53.300]

[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:53.300]

[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:53.300]

[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:53.300]

[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:53.300]

[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:53.500]
This is a Gold Gold.

[01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:53.500]

[01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:53.660]
This is a Gold Gold.

[01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:54.500]
This is a Gold Gold.

[01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:55.700]
This is a Gold Gold.

[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:58.120]
This is a Gold Gold.

[01:01:58.120 --> 01:01:58.740]
This is a Gold Gold.

[01:01:58.740 --> 01:01:59.980]
This is a Gold Gold.

[01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:01.140]
This is a Gold Gold.

[01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:01.280]
This is a Gold Gold.

[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:01.800]
This is a Gold Gold.

[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:02.940]
This is a Gold Gold.

[01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:05.020]
This is a Gold Gold.

[01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:06.280]
This is a Gold Gold.

[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:06.740]
This is a Gold Gold.

[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:08.960]
But I prefer to sell now, like in all cities,

[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:11.000]
powers and cities for rich kids.

[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:14.880]
I am done, I can really read all through.

[01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:19.700]
How happy they'll find me, they'll love me, do you?

[01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:22.200]
Don't be scared, they'll be nobody knows you,

[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:24.240]
wait out, they'll be nobody knows you, I am,

[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:25.800]
they'll be nobody knows you, I am,

[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.700]
they'll be with women, they'll be with women,

[01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:30.280]
they'll be with women, they'll be with women,

[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:44.720]
they'll be with women, they'll be with women,

[01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:45.320]
they'll be with women, they'll be with women,

[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:45.320]

[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:45.320]

[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:46.180]
they'll be with women, they'll be with women,

[01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:47.480]
they'll be with women, they'll be with women,

[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:47.900]
they'll be with women, they'll also be with women,

[01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:47.900]

[01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:47.900]

[01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:47.900]

[01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:48.240]
they'll be with women, they'll be with women,

[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:48.240]

[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:48.240]

[01:02:48.240 --> 01:03:00.260]
yes, they'll be with women who may be immortal,

[01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:00.260]

[01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:01.980]
legend in your mind. He's in the dark.

[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:03.720]
The video everybody else in the

[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:05.780]
Nozzlin and you know like the whole

[01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:07.460]
staff had it and encountered with him

[01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:08.560]
except for me. Really?

[01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:10.760]
Oh you never ran into him? You never

[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:12.700]
encountered him? No, but Josh will give you

[01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:14.120]
a long detailed description of how

[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:16.140]
grizzly and short and sun-fried he is.

[01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:18.060]
And obnoxious? Yeah.

[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:19.540]
That melanoma bit comes to mind.

[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:21.020]
That was in dress like Austin Powers?

[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:23.060]
What do you saw him? No, not really.

[01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:23.460]
You're okay.

[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:26.800]
He had the... He wants on. Maybe we can

[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:27.940]
give him two to four. What do you say?

[01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:30.120]
He had the dark glasses on inside.

[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:30.940]
I don't trust people.

[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:32.220]
Yeah, all of the people on our shades

[01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:34.100]
inside. Richard Bells, who does that too?

[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:35.460]
I'm very nervous about people

[01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:36.740]
who wear a shade inside.

[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:38.440]
Who does? Howard.

[01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:40.320]
Stirred. Oh he does?

[01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:42.500]
He's never seen him without his

[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:44.020]
sunglasses. A little round does.

[01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:45.660]
That's what we just part of his body.

[01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:49.480]
I just don't know what that's all about.

[01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:50.780]
There's a guy that does a sports

[01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:51.940]
show on the fan up here.

[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:53.040]
It's called being one of the cool

[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:53.820]
in the summer.

[01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:54.600]
And the summer piston on TV.

[01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:55.620]
I don't know what his name is.

[01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:57.500]
He's a very marginal.

[01:03:58.120 --> 01:03:59.600]
And he wears shades all the time.

[01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:00.640]
What are you doing to show?

[01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:01.720]
It's called being a cool radio.

[01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:02.840]
Oh, is that what it is?

[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:04.580]
He's about as cool as an elephant's fart.

[01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:08.940]
Oh, speaking of cool, the MTV awards say,

[01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:10.720]
goodbye to Miami, but they've had it,

[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:11.780]
and who could blame him?

[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:12.300]
Certainly.

[01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:13.860]
Perhaps a little bit homesticks

[01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:15.120]
sick after spending the last years

[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:15.880]
Miami, they're heading back

[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:17.180]
to the big Apple this August.

[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:18.860]
The York City's our hometown,

[01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:20.600]
MTV's president, Christine and Norman

[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:22.120]
said, Christine and Norman Kent.

[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:23.620]
In a statement released yesterday

[01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:24.380]
for the A&P.

[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:26.400]
The ocean blue waters of Miami

[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:27.620]
had been the background for the awards

[01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:29.820]
since 2004, with stars arriving by yacht.

[01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:31.180]
The awards taking place on the

[01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:32.060]
Merck and Irline's arena.

[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:34.400]
At the Yenta Arena, the Mickey

[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:35.740]
Irson arena, the corrupt one.

[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:37.180]
And actor show party's hell on

[01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:38.100]
Fashionable South Beach.

[01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:40.020]
But this year, radio sitting music

[01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:41.160]
called the venue and MTV

[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:42.860]
promised to do all its power to focus

[01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:44.460]
attention on the August 31st event,

[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:45.400]
market down on your arm.

[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.020]
We are really looking to showcase the music,

[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:49.180]
culture and people from every

[01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:50.880]
burrow of this amazing city on TV,

[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:53.040]
online, broadband and wireless,

[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:54.500]
to fans around the globe.

[01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:56.300]
Norman said, Norman Elliott Kent.

[01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:57.840]
Kent.

[01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:00.360]
Pomp and O Beach, how do you

[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:01.520]
lose a streetlight this

[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:02.600]
unsanimal wants to know?

[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:04.660]
Several cities in Broward County

[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:06.200]
fear FPNL, Florida Plunder and

[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:07.180]
Lut is lost more than a few

[01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:08.220]
in his building taxpayers for

[01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:09.200]
light poles that don't exist.

[01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:09.840]
Uh-huh.

[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:11.220]
Not Florida Plunder and Lut.

[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:11.620]
G.

[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:13.540]
Sounds dishonest to me.

[01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:16.440]
The dispute between the cities

[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:17.840]
and the utility giant over the true

[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:18.940]
number of streetlights has reached

[01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:20.580]
the face-off in Pomp and O Beach.

[01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:21.520]
But I still don't have

[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:22.780]
any Pomp and O Park copy, Troy.

[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:24.020]
I'd be more than happy to do it

[01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:24.900]
to throw a spot in there.

[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:26.320]
Go to Pomp and O Park,

[01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:27.480]
lose your money, have a good time.

[01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:29.660]
One of the good news from the

[01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:30.500]
Hump of the other day is that

[01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:31.180]
they're not going to have to

[01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:32.360]
close down the poker rooms at

[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:33.340]
the Pirm mutual just because

[01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:34.200]
the slots are coming in,

[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:35.120]
even though your fat ass

[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:35.920]
government want to shut that

[01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:36.180]
down.

[01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:39.040]
I say shut the lottery down.

[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.160]
City leaders said they've been

[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:43.220]
paying for 453 light poles

[01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:44.520]
too many in Pomp and O Beach.

[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:46.380]
They planned to slice 60-1,000

[01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:47.340]
plus from their electric bill

[01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:48.880]
nice month, recouping more than a

[01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:49.600]
year of overpayments

[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:50.800]
whether FPNL likes it or not.

[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:52.000]
So there you go.

[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:54.380]
Tamaracking close springs also

[01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:55.820]
are counting poles to see

[01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:56.800]
whether the residents are being

[01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:57.320]
overbilled.

[01:05:57.900 --> 01:05:58.860]
What if they're counting poles

[01:05:58.860 --> 01:05:59.240]
in Buffalo?

[01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:01.760]
Public work staff is in

[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:03.160]
Coral Springs, sampled 600 lights

[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:04.020]
in their city they couldn't

[01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:05.120]
find 36 of them.

[01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:07.020]
In Fort Lauderdale, recent

[01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:08.080]
annexations have led city

[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:08.920]
officials to wonder whether

[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:09.900]
they too are being

[01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:10.740]
overcharged by Florida

[01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:11.360]
Plunder and Lut.

[01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:13.120]
The doubting began in Pomp and O Beach

[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:14.080]
where leaders have argued for

[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:15.720]
more than a year that FPL has

[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:16.600]
overcharged the city.

[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:17.940]
The power company charges

[01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:19.060]
governments of flat rate for

[01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:20.000]
every streetlight but doesn't

[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.100]
often update its counts.

[01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:22.580]
In December 2004,

[01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:24.000]
say these presented the

[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:24.720]
power company with their

[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:26.200]
survey totally 6200 street

[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:27.580]
lights, they told FPNL they were

[01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:28.440]
overpaying by over four

[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:29.180]
grand a month for the

[01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:31.340]
153 missing light poles.

[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:34.160]
Email records your city

[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:34.920]
officials placed the

[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:36.440]
fixed bill never resolved.

[01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:37.800]
Just like those bills

[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:38.740]
that easily keep fit.

[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:39.600]
You know, like from the

[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:41.340]
satellite people, never paid

[01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:42.200]
never resolved.

[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:43.840]
That's me on my Pomp and O Beach.

[01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:45.260]
Well there you go.

[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:46.400]
You can rip off, man.

[01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:46.800]
I know.

[01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:49.880]
I'd write to somebody.

[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:49.980]

[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:49.980]

[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:49.980]

[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:49.980]

[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:49.980]

[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:49.980]

[01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:51.440]
Write to the Harold.

[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:53.320]
Call up the L Sunshine on

[01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:54.120]
Channel 4 and see if

[01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:55.100]
he'll wave his ham-hawks at.

[01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:57.660]
766 goes.

[01:06:57.780 --> 01:06:58.380]
We're not going to make a

[01:06:58.380 --> 01:06:59.180]
thousand today and that's

[01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:00.020]
going to be really depressing

[01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:00.660]
because you people are

[01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:02.140]
really slackin' off 774.

[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:03.040]
See how it's

[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:04.260]
hoping we get to like 800 by

[01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:04.480]
noon?

[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:06.660]
Not going to happen.

[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:06.920]
Nope.

[01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:08.920]
Well, so how are we going to

[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:09.520]
get to a thousand?

[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:10.180]
Get out and push.

[01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:11.920]
We're going to push it.

[01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:12.340]
Hmm hmm.

[01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:15.040]
Which, and you know, well we

[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:16.320]
had a really slow start because

[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:17.360]
ordinarily I put the next

[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:18.540]
days pull on around 6.7

[01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:19.500]
and the PM to give them a

[01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:19.880]
head start.

[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:19.960]

[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:19.960]

[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:20.620]
Because we don't want them to

[01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:21.600]
get too bored with the

[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:22.140]
previous one.

[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:24.800]
Virginia's comments piss you

[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:25.240]
off the most.

[01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:26.000]
Maybe they just don't like

[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:26.660]
this pull because they

[01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:27.460]
all agree with everything I

[01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:28.500]
say because how, you know,

[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:29.180]
how could they not?

[01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:30.480]
I agree with everything I

[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:30.740]
say.

[01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:31.540]
That was my vote.

[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:33.680]
None of his comments piss me

[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:35.960]
off 633, a full 81.7%.

[01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:39.100]
His comments about politics

[01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:40.340]
peen you off 33.

[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:41.780]
I get peed off.

[01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:43.360]
His comments about blacks

[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:44.060]
26.

[01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:45.160]
His comments about religion

[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:45.720]
26.

[01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:46.920]
How about religious blacks?

[01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:49.160]
Fakers like Al Sharpton.

[01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:49.940]
His comments about

[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:49.940]

[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:49.940]

[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:49.940]

[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:51.500]
guns 26.

[01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:52.520]
His comments about

[01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:54.660]
Orthodox Jews 10.

[01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:56.720]
Just wait till July, man,

[01:07:56.820 --> 01:07:57.440]
when they like we're in a

[01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:58.860]
400 pounds of clothing the

[01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:00.200]
heavy coat with a big

[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:01.620]
shmata on the head and they

[01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:02.520]
smell like the end of the

[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:02.740]
world.

[01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:04.980]
As a matter of fact, if you

[01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:05.740]
wonder what the end of the

[01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:06.580]
world smells like, come to

[01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:06.920]
woodbind.

[01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:07.680]
Okay.

[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:08.740]
His comments about

[01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:09.680]
Cubans 9.

[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:10.520]
His comments about

[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:11.680]
colors 8.

[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:12.780]
His comments about red

[01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:12.960]
next.

[01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:14.060]
Soldamate trace.

[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:15.180]
I don't understand that.

[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:16.080]
Maybe we just don't got no

[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:17.320]
red next to get pissed off.

[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:18.260]
Out of 7.78.

[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:18.800]
That's great.

[01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:20.220]
We'll get to the 1000.

[01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:20.680]
You'll see.

[01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:23.060]
Or there's a will.

[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:24.320]
There's a will.

[01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:25.620]
There's a will.

[01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:26.160]
There's a will.

[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:26.280]
There's a will.

[01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:26.660]

[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:28.920]
Tom says, listen to what

[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:29.800]
interview with Kevin Phillips

[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:31.260]
on NPR's fresh areas that

[01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:32.020]
they regarding his new book

[01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:33.460]
American Theocracy in which

[01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:35.420]
he blasted Bush and laid out

[01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:36.400]
the obvious connection between

[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:37.300]
the right wing, big world,

[01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:38.000]
and the war.

[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:40.400]
There's the Bush constituency.

[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.120]
Radical religious right wing

[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:43.240]
is led by the Cheneyites who

[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:44.180]
equate national security

[01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:44.920]
with private sector

[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:45.280]
profits.

[01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:45.840]
What a shock.

[01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:46.980]
Did anyone ever tell the

[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:47.800]
kids of their parents at the

[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:48.800]
recruiting office that

[01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:49.640]
were brought to embark on a

[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:50.700]
great Christian crusade to

[01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:51.980]
make exon executives richer?

[01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:53.480]
No, they were set off to be

[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:54.820]
named and murdered so they

[01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:55.600]
could accomplish the great

[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:56.120]
mission of their

[01:08:56.580 --> 01:08:56.940]
democratization.

[01:08:57.300 --> 01:08:58.300]
Right, Democrat democracy is

[01:08:58.300 --> 01:08:58.740]
on the march.

[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:00.380]
There he is, he's in

[01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:01.220]
Wheeling West Virginia.

[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:01.500]
So?

[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:02.920]
I retired approximately two years.

[01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:03.580]
He's Wheeling it.

[01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:05.680]
After all the lies, if we're

[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:06.520]
finally to believe that our

[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:07.620]
nation's ultimate purpose in

[01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:08.640]
Iraq is to bring the true meaning

[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:09.740]
of American democracy to a

[01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:10.780]
bunch of religious zealots,

[01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:12.020]
then when it hasn't been

[01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:12.840]
more appropriate for our

[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:14.180]
soldiers to look home, scratch

[01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:15.500]
their heads and say, we have

[01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:16.560]
met the enemy and he is us.

[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:17.800]
But that's not like something

[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:18.720]
that Charles Schultz would say

[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:19.060]
in Pino.

[01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:21.640]
Didn't he say four score in

[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:22.500]
the seven years ago?

[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:23.920]
Just the other day?

[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:25.060]
I think he said that.

[01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:26.380]
Charlie Schultz.

[01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:27.640]
What was that?

[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:28.400]
George Schultz.

[01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:30.020]
Sergeant Schultz.

[01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:31.000]
See, this is one of, this is

[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.400]
one happens when you eat way

[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:33.400]
too much and you don't

[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:34.360]
test your blood sugar.

[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:35.260]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:37.900]
It's a drain.

[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:39.000]
It drains the flow of the

[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.340]
blood from your brain and all

[01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:41.120]
of a sudden it's like you

[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:41.960]
have like a vacuum.

[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:42.880]
It drains your brain.

[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:44.420]
It's a brain drain.

[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:45.200]
Like we have an

[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:46.080]
ecu-em-sales department.

[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:46.540]
There are a bunch of

[01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:47.240]
brain drain.

[01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:48.420]
A strain.

[01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:51.200]
Prost-speaking of a strain,

[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:51.960]
Prost-cute is

[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:52.900]
dropped sex case against

[01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:53.320]
teacher.

[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:54.640]
Did you see this?

[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:55.400]
Yes, I did.

[01:09:55.540 --> 01:09:56.920]
I let out a hoop, a

[01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:57.620]
hoop, and a holler.

[01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:58.300]
I see.

[01:09:58.400 --> 01:09:58.740]
You like her?

[01:09:59.280 --> 01:09:59.640]
Sure.

[01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:01.360]
She's a nice, blonde young

[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:01.600]
lady.

[01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:04.300]
You know, my heart goes out

[01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:05.260]
to her and this is the only.

[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:06.460]
She's got her hand over her

[01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:06.580]
heart.

[01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:07.160]
She looks like she's

[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:08.280]
seeing the anacidlantum or

[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:08.500]
something.

[01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:09.460]
I'm here for her.

[01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:10.260]
I'm here for you, Debbie.

[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:11.720]
And she ain't interested.

[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:12.160]
I know.

[01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:14.080]
Prost-cute is if drop charges

[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:15.080]
yesterday against the former

[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:16.080]
teacher accused of having

[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:16.960]
sex with a middle school

[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:18.140]
student, but teacher,

[01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:20.360]
Deborah LaFave, offered her

[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:21.500]
deepest apologies to the

[01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:22.480]
14-year-old boy and his

[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:22.860]
family.

[01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:24.460]
LaFave, this is an

[01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:25.760]
O'Cala, where they were

[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:26.540]
just horse and around.

[01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:28.700]
LaFave 25 said she's

[01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:29.720]
undergoing therapy for

[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:30.660]
bipolar disorder.

[01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:32.520]
That's exciting.

[01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:33.120]
That's what I thought

[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:33.760]
that she was by.

[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:35.240]
Very, very

[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:36.180]
remorseful about the events

[01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:37.060]
that led to her arrest in

[01:10:37.060 --> 01:10:37.700]
June 2004.

[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:38.880]
She's very remorseful.

[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:39.960]
And on the story, you can

[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:40.960]
click on the link and watch

[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:41.660]
her explain it.

[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:42.740]
Make it.

[01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:43.180]
Not.

[01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:44.980]
My greatest regret would

[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:45.920]
probably be the fact that I

[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:46.800]
put this young man through

[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:47.460]
this, she said.

[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:48.560]
LaFave thought reading in a

[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:49.360]
suburban camp a middle

[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:50.300]
school before her arrest.

[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:51.140]
The boy told the

[01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:52.040]
investigators he had sex

[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:52.920]
with LaFave three times

[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:54.640]
in four days in June 2004

[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:55.620]
according to court documents.

[01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:56.960]
One of those times was in a

[01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:58.320]
car while a 15-year-old

[01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.140]
cousin drove him around

[01:10:59.140 --> 01:10:59.900]
in four or 30s.

[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:00.800]
I wonder if his cousin was

[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:01.340]
looking in the rearview

[01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:02.060]
mirror like, I think?

[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:02.680]
Probably.

[01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:04.100]
Or like reaching back

[01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:05.020]
over the seat.

[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:06.520]
He grabbed a little

[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:06.840]
something.

[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:08.360]
Of course, I'm not sure

[01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:08.960]
what he was grabbing.

[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:10.380]
He also says he performed

[01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:11.460]
oral sex on him multiple

[01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:12.620]
times, including once

[01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:13.160]
at her home.

[01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:15.000]
In November of

[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:15.820]
February the guilty in

[01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:16.400]
Hillsborough County

[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:17.260]
court to two counsel,

[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:17.900]
Lutin, Las Vegas

[01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:19.040]
behavior, she was

[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:19.740]
sentenced in a shadow

[01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:20.920]
to be spanked.

[01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:21.280]
Yeah.

[01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:22.460]
That's a sheer idea.

[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:26.000]
She was sentenced in that

[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:26.840]
case to three years under

[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:27.840]
house arrest and seven years

[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:28.720]
probation required to

[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:29.540]
register as a sex

[01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:30.080]
offender.

[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:31.280]
One of the incidents was

[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:31.920]
alleged to have occurred

[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:32.840]
in Marion County.

[01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:34.160]
So similar charges also

[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:34.760]
were filed there.

[01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:35.720]
And LaFave's defense

[01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:36.600]
negotiated a similar

[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:37.700]
P agreement.

[01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:39.280]
The fact that he was

[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:40.200]
tossed out yesterday by

[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:40.820]
Marion County's

[01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:41.500]
superior court judge

[01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:43.020]
Hale Stancell and

[01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:43.980]
prosecutors there dropped

[01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:44.860]
charges when the team

[01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:45.740]
bought the testifying.

[01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:46.240]
He's mum.

[01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:47.360]
He ain't speaking.

[01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:49.080]
It's over.

[01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:50.360]
And this time the case is

[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:51.280]
really over and for good

[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:52.120]
LaFave's lawyer, John

[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:53.100]
Fitzgibbon, told reporters.

[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:54.140]
We can only hope now

[01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:54.980]
that next few weeks Debbie

[01:11:54.980 --> 01:11:55.920]
will basically fade into

[01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:57.120]
a footnote in everybody's

[01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:57.720]
memory except the

[01:11:57.720 --> 01:11:58.040]
kid accord.

[01:11:58.120 --> 01:11:58.500]
No, no.

[01:11:58.820 --> 01:11:59.800]
It needs the post for

[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:00.520]
playboy or something.

[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:01.280]
In a written statement

[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:02.240]
assistant, state attorney

[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:03.480]
Richard Ridgeway said the

[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:04.520]
trial was likely to be broadcast

[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:05.800]
on cable TV, raising

[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:06.800]
concerns about the privacy

[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:07.500]
of the boilerplate was

[01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:08.080]
accused of molesting.

[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:08.880]
He would have been the

[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:09.740]
prosecutor's key witness

[01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:10.500]
for not no mol.

[01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:11.400]
The court may be willing

[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:12.160]
to risk the well-being of

[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:13.060]
victims in this case or

[01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:13.920]
to force it to trial

[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:15.340]
Ridgeway said, I am not.

[01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:17.700]
LaFave criticized the

[01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:18.480]
extensive media coverage

[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:19.140]
of her case received

[01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:20.380]
accusing reporters of

[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:21.300]
impending the privacy of

[01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:22.020]
her former student.

[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:23.620]
She said she was taking a

[01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:24.620]
journalism course online

[01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:26.180]
adding, God has given me a

[01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:27.020]
great outlet to write.

[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:27.820]
Damn God!

[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:28.740]
And I would hope I could

[01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:29.700]
reach people through writing.

[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:30.980]
I'm a strong Christian

[01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:31.280]
woman.

[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:32.720]
She said, I believe that God

[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:33.940]
has a path for me and

[01:12:33.940 --> 01:12:35.520]
that was just a bump in

[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:35.860]
the road.

[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:37.080]
She said it felt like a

[01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:37.280]
bump.

[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:39.840]
This is Neil Rogers.

[01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:44.460]
This is 516QAWATSAL.

[01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:47.320]
Uh-huh.

[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:48.640]
This is Pope John Paul

[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:48.920]
Lins.

[01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:50.100]
Think that he asked me.

[01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:51.020]
They only think more

[01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:51.820]
fun than playing

[01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:53.140]
grad-ass with a Swiss guy.

[01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:55.340]
Is the Neil Rogers 12-1-Hour?

[01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:55.860]
Oh.

[01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:03.600]
I'm a strong Christian woman.

[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:03.600]

[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:03.640]
I'm a strong Christian woman.

[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:05.600]
I'm a strong Christian woman.

[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:08.680]
I'm a strong Christian woman.

[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:09.820]
I'm a strong Christian woman.

[01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:12.060]
I'm a strong Christian woman.

[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:13.560]
I'm a strong Christian woman.

[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:13.860]
I'm a strong Christian woman.

[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:13.860]

[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:13.860]

[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:13.860]

[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:13.860]

[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:13.860]

[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:13.860]

[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:13.860]

[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:13.860]

[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:15.660]
You woke me up early this morning.

[01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:16.900]
I'm a strong Christian woman.

[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:23.660]
I'm a strong Christian woman.

[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:24.920]
I'm a strong Christian woman.

[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:25.160]
I'm a strong Christian woman.

[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:25.680]
I'm a strong Christian woman.

[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:25.840]
I'm a strong Christian woman.

[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:55.820]
I'm a strong Christian woman.

[01:13:55.820 --> 01:13:55.820]

[01:13:55.820 --> 01:13:59.160]
You're on pitch, you're so stinky

[01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:02.760]
It's not like I can't be on my sweater

[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:05.480]
Oh, the real where I was said

[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:08.580]
I think I'm gonna send you a letter

[01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:11.400]
Saying you're so stinky

[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:21.700]
When I'll drive and hold in the air with you here

[01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:26.640]
Because you smell like someone's vomit makes which sail here

[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:28.400]
I'm stuck in this time

[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:33.080]
And get down to feeling just a little bit tired of this

[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:37.820]
It's so open, nice perfume, you know it does exist

[01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:40.180]
Oh, I'll care if the White House everything is okay

[01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:41.420]
I'll wear a fly

[01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:44.740]
It's a lot of the robot checked out the package

[01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:48.020]
And a motor like moldy wood when it works

[01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:51.300]
Check your pulse, you smell like a quartz bud

[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:54.600]
When you're in your hair and wash your red

[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:57.480]
Wreck them to shut the exit for you red

[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:00.300]
I'm some speed stick for your armpits

[01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:02.800]
You're so stinky

[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:06.080]
Smell like a peppy hot sweat

[01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:07.640]
Oh, the real where I was said

[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:09.500]
All clear at the White House everything is A okay

[01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:11.140]
797 votes on the pool

[01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:12.360]
We're not gonna make our thousand notes

[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:13.960]
We get to about 850 by the bottom of the hour

[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:16.080]
You folks better get with and hop on it

[01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:19.040]
Asked out what your talk host can do for you

[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:21.460]
Ask what you can do a very minimal effort

[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:23.560]
Of course I think that's the whole audience now

[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.340]
And it's 750 some about right?

[01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:26.220]
790

[01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:27.620]
790

[01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:31.480]
Man held at the White House suspicious package probe

[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:34.120]
But there's nothing worse than a suspicious package

[01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:37.600]
Man of Tostey suspicious package out of the North lawn

[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:39.360]
Of the White House today has been taken into custody

[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:40.400]
According to the Secret Service

[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:43.600]
Well, I guess I won't watch him Michael more today

[01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:46.680]
This individual has done a similar act in the past

[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:49.480]
He's in custody since he could serve as spokesman Tom Mazer

[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:51.000]
I wonder if he's keen to build Mazer

[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:54.440]
The old sports nerd guy from Buffalo and then WHN in New York

[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:56.500]
Which is now the station at Moorazon

[01:15:56.500 --> 01:16:00.080]
The package was noticed just after President Bush left

[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:03.220]
I helicopter from the South lawn on the opposite side of the White House

[01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:04.620]
For a trip to Wheeling West Virginia

[01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:06.440]
What a good place for him

[01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:09.960]
A remote control device was used to probe the package

[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:11.660]
It was Robbie the robot I'm sure of it

[01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:13.720]
Right?

[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:15.580]
Right, just a few days ago

[01:16:15.580 --> 01:16:16.680]
No, I didn't

[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:17.560]
Oh, come on

[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:20.680]
A remote controlled robot was used to probe the package

[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:23.120]
It was probing it and the offensive runs along Pennsylvania Avenue

[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:25.700]
Normal security protocols are in place Mazer said

[01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:27.840]
The Secret Service secured the White House

[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:30.920]
Emraged its internal alert system by one level during the investigation

[01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:32.140]
To, um,

[01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:33.500]
BAAAAMING

[01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:33.960]
Pink

[01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:38.240]
Report is camera men and photographers who were told to remain inside the briefing room

[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:39.800]
Well, off it, but now we got the all clear

[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:41.100]
Everything is just A-OK

[01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:41.700]
OK

[01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:42.720]
Everything's fine

[01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:43.940]
Thanks God

[01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:50.040]
5670560, 0560, and they've arrived in singular wireless lines

[01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:53.220]
Well, at East Fones man have died off like Abe Lincoln

[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.680]
Just as dead as a door nail

[01:16:57.020 --> 01:16:57.980]
Aren't you shocked?

[01:16:58.520 --> 01:16:58.640]
Nope

[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:00.560]
I think it's going to be a long hot summer

[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:01.500]
I don't want to get your old nervous

[01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:02.520]
Always in and out there

[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:04.340]
June is always two only two months away

[01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:04.960]
I know

[01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:07.400]
No, three, I'm sorry, three months

[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:08.000]
Oh, I'm sorry

[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:11.580]
Don't count your chickens before or in a hatch

[01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:13.440]
Three months away

[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:14.440]
Damn, April made

[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:19.140]
And we got only, I think one more exhibition is Marlon Daygames next to the 1250

[01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:20.820]
Yeah, exactly

[01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:22.260]
Somebody QYM, hello

[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:23.160]
Neil

[01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:24.080]
Yes, sir

[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:26.660]
Hey, I was gone to see V for Vendetta

[01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:28.100]
Did you hear?

[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:30.600]
No, you were out in Josh's eye

[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:31.580]
Did they like it?

[01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:34.640]
George thought it was OK, Josh liked it a lot

[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:35.960]
Yeah, I liked it a lot

[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:38.800]
Actually, while I was on hold a few times when I was calling

[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:45.000]
I heard you say Christian Crusader reminded me of the point I wanted to make on your show

[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.480]
A while ago, I forgot to do it

[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:48.660]
What has religion

[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:50.700]
What has religion produced?

[01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:51.280]
Who did more?

[01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:54.060]
What is religion produced?

[01:17:54.340 --> 01:17:55.820]
What has religion put forward?

[01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:57.200]
What inventions has it made?

[01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:00.580]
What has it contributed in history?

[01:18:01.220 --> 01:18:03.520]
Well, we learned that the earth was flat, we learned that

[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:05.120]
Hey, it got a lot of people to heaven

[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:05.720]
Right

[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:07.100]
A lot of people killed

[01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:10.980]
Their point of view is based in religion, you know, these psychopaths

[01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:11.920]
But we're running the country

[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:16.160]
They're based on a point of view that's based on what is it produced?

[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:20.520]
Other events, based on the evidence in superstition and focus, all of these things

[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:25.480]
Anyone who calls in and says charity, my God, who hasn't given something charitable in their life

[01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:29.520]
It's religion is not needed to give charity, so other than that

[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:33.120]
I want people to call in and tell me what has religion done?

[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:36.140]
I'm here to listen when you hear your own show, you haven't called in and tell you that

[01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:38.000]
Because I don't want to hear about it, it's all nonsense

[01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:40.900]
Somebody QAM, hello

[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:42.120]
Hey Neil

[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:42.900]
Yes sir

[01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:43.940]
I got two comments

[01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:47.660]
I just saw Steve America the other day, I've never seen a report

[01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:48.100]
Excellent

[01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:51.060]
Why did Michael Moore blow himself up?

[01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:52.340]
Because he's a terrorist

[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:54.440]
He is a terrorist?

[01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:56.860]
Well, I mean, according to the right wing, yeah

[01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:59.120]
And there's a second comment

[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:02.480]
The second comment is America and Syria

[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:06.220]
You hear that right up?

[01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:08.160]
Yeah, sure you will

[01:19:08.620 --> 01:19:12.440]
Well, it reminds me of some of the clips they showed in the interviews with some of the soldiers in Iraq

[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:16.960]
About killing some effin, you know, a ragheads or whatever it is

[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:19.520]
You saw that, well that was in also in turn, in 2011

[01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:21.820]
All of these movies that we've been watching

[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:25.560]
Be sure to watch loose change part two on our website, even though I know what you won't

[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:27.780]
You won't even look at the Dreamfield pasta thing

[01:19:27.780 --> 01:19:30.000]
We just, you know, we just lost the club, that's all

[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.840]
And it's just a coincidence that it happened a long time the new regime came along, you know

[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:34.940]
It's just a coincidence, I'm sure

[01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:40.700]
We were kicking big fat smelly ass for a long time for years, even on this marginal sports station

[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:45.800]
And then this new regime came along and man, oh man, you talk about dropping the balls

[01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:48.940]
How's that Palpatot Park spot coming?

[01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:54.360]
I'm serious, I would give them a free spot

[01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:58.960]
If Steve will, just thanks me direct the copies, he's got the fast number, I give him a free spot

[01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:01.700]
Urge everywhere, come out for the racing 735

[01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:03.660]
Then I had to poke a room as open now, eight minutes ago

[01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:08.780]
We got the slots coming in July, we got time on casting you made these seven days week free parking for your admission

[01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:10.360]
Every day

[01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:14.380]
Racing Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, what live racing?

[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:16.860]
Third, it was in here somewhere

[01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:19.560]
Looking at something like that

[01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:20.380]
Looking joyously

[01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:22.660]
Yeah

[01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:26.660]
It's great, how many QIMs? Hello

[01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:27.880]
Hello

[01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:28.760]
Yes sir

[01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:29.780]
And I picked the new piece

[01:20:29.780 --> 01:20:34.280]
And then of course that one steamer, everybody's a mad demon, faggot, faggot everywhere

[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:35.880]
Yes sir, speaking

[01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:42.780]
I just wanted to find out if you saw our president dodging every question that he gave him on

[01:20:43.540 --> 01:20:45.660]
Supposedly the new press conference that he gave him

[01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:47.660]
Yeah, I've seen it, yeah I was right here, I've seen it

[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:51.900]
Well I think he just tried to advise everything that you know everybody wants to know

[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:55.500]
And for the next two years he's going to be the same story man

[01:20:56.740 --> 01:20:59.960]
Okay man, thanks for the bulletin

[01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:04.420]
5670560, how do you like that? Was that a perceptive crawler one? That was pretty good

[01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:05.440]
Right on it

[01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:07.660]
Just finished his guacamole

[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:10.500]
Okay, goodbye, bye-bye

[01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:14.160]
See I don't even waste my time with it, just like stick my finger on it

[01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:16.780]
Squash it, like a, like a, like a, under the block

[01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:18.080]
Right, like step it and do

[01:21:19.660 --> 01:21:21.720]
5670560, last call for calls maybe this week

[01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:25.360]
Okay, I might just like dispense with all these calls this week because I don't know why I keep doing this you know

[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:28.540]
I keep trying to talk since this new management into our sales staff

[01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:33.040]
And talk to a Troy Stratford about getting the, and about getting a straight answer out of Duff

[01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:34.440]
Hey Duff, let me say it again

[01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:36.480]
I don't care who you are, you fairy

[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:39.320]
We're gonna have a response man, look at this underwhelming response

[01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:42.780]
Happy 30th anniversary Neal, by the way we don't want to talk about anything

[01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:48.060]
We went for months and months and months man, these phones were smoking, am I right?

[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:48.940]
They were smoking

[01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:50.760]
And then somebody stood with your stuff

[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:53.260]
And by the way you could smoke that two ounces by the weekend

[01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:54.820]
Hey, you got that right

[01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:58.340]
Well you said yesterday two ounces is an awful lot, I don't think for a guy like you

[01:21:58.340 --> 01:21:58.660]
Yeah

[01:21:59.220 --> 01:22:00.960]
You can handle it, it's a toy by the way

[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:02.560]
You know what I'm saying, it's you and Joe Kustello

[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:03.460]
He had

[01:22:06.340 --> 01:22:08.000]
Oh, that's whatever happened to him

[01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:09.780]
I don't know what you're talking about

[01:22:09.860 --> 01:22:15.600]
Get out of here, stop talking crap on here, you say one thing off here and then on here you're all like sucking up to the day

[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:17.640]
Everything that I've said about Joe Kustello

[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:19.040]
You're gonna have to say something

[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:20.860]
You just ain't the same, he's just not the same

[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:22.760]
I don't know what he's missing to me

[01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:25.760]
Yeah, he is the same, so maybe you didn't notice something before

[01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:29.860]
Oh I'm, I apologize, that's your right

[01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:33.220]
That was excellent

[01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:35.540]
Stephanie Kya, UAM, hello

[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:37.620]
Uncle Neil, yes

[01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:42.440]
The banter about the why you and Hank have this morning about we met the enemy

[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:48.480]
And he is us with actually a cartoon called Pogo that was indicated

[01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:49.840]
Walter, was that Walter Lance?

[01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:55.340]
Uh, or Mark Lance, Walter Lance, the Woody Woodburger, no, was not Charles Schruel's Pogo, so well done

[01:22:55.340 --> 01:22:59.820]
You hit the nail on the head, but you were over like, as in he was

[01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:03.400]
So it was, it was a good deal

[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:07.080]
And he still won't take his blood sugar, he's not gonna care about staying alive this guy

[01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:09.180]
I don't know what I'm gonna do with that man, but that's that man

[01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:09.960]
Huh, no you're right

[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.120]
Just, just be programy, just tell me, I forget about it

[01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:15.280]
If you were here at Slapia

[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:18.960]
Yeah, give me a little slap on the side of the head and slap the motto of you

[01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:24.120]
You're right, fat people, you're not gonna be fat, they want to die, we can do it

[01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:25.040]
That's it, it is

[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:26.700]
We're taking a look at this

[01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:27.620]
That is it

[01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:29.080]
It's 5.62

[01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:37.720]
This is your ball on the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs, they don't come any better than Neil Roger

[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:39.640]
Are you obsessed with sports?

[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:43.040]
Hearing for ball teams from colleges you've never been to?

[01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:46.200]
Worshiping this functional drawing men called Cove?

[01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:47.200]
Hey Cove!

[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:52.800]
Unable to form your own opinion so you resort to calling a sport whole radio show for their cake

[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:56.400]
But you need something to do in the queen games, don't you?

[01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:58.200]
Or you're being forced to think?

[01:23:58.820 --> 01:24:01.540]
Well take this, sport whole, Jack Strap Gun

[01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:07.000]
Don't get drunk, don't be long enough

[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:19.160]
Surround yourself with sports inside and out, with the satisfying taste of growing juice

[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:25.320]
Jack Strap Gun is individually wrapped sticks of yellow gum, assorted in the flavor of your favorite athlete

[01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:31.960]
So embrace the dumbness and enjoy the long lasting flavor of congealed sweat

[01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:33.980]
Don't be long enough

[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:38.020]
Don't be long enough

[01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:41.540]
Don't be long enough

[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:43.340]
Don't be long enough

[01:24:43.340 --> 01:24:48.200]
I think that would be an even better slogan than the one I had in mind about this QAM

[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:49.540]
The stage that takes the joy out of living

[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:52.480]
Embraced the dumbness of sports talk

[01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:54.880]
So like that embrace the dumbness

[01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:59.460]
Okay, 829 vote met 1216

[01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:01.480]
It means like by the bottom of the air we ought to have about 8 feet

[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:04.060]
And we'll do it, we'll get our thoughts on it, it's better what Josh said before

[01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:11.160]
No confidence man, you see me do it before you see me put these people over the edge by just slapping them

[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:13.380]
I whip at them in a shake, they're so lethargic

[01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:17.060]
It's sad, it's tragic, it's such a lethargic place

[01:25:17.060 --> 01:25:20.340]
Must be that sunshine that just melts everybody in the state of lethargy

[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:26.200]
Sitting off in a corner in a big lounge chair shoveling all kinds of Doritos and crap in their fat face

[01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:30.500]
And who the hell am I to talk after eating all that damn ice cream and all that garbage I was eating for?

[01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:33.180]
Yeah, that's right for a month, it's a miracle I'm still alive

[01:25:33.180 --> 01:25:33.820]
Yes it is

[01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:35.160]
And I'm lecturing other people

[01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:40.080]
Just that I happen to discover something that I'm really excited about and nobody else cares

[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:42.020]
Nobody all of the beast was asking to see

[01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:44.880]
And I want to clarify one thing about that beam feels not leaving alone

[01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:49.840]
Because I'm not making no money off of it and it cost me an arm and 16 legs that I've shipped up here

[01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:52.660]
But I have two shipments

[01:25:53.420 --> 01:25:55.180]
I got enough to feed the Chinese army

[01:25:56.160 --> 01:26:00.380]
But it's not like the, because we've in the past had some substitute postes

[01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:04.120]
And that's why people that I've been expressly are really a very leery of this stuff

[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:06.640]
Like that slimy, sure talking noodle stuff I talked about

[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:11.420]
Oh man, shoe leather, shoe laces, horrible crap

[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:16.980]
But this is like regular postes, they have any tofu in it, no soy

[01:26:17.980 --> 01:26:19.240]
Yes, soy what?

[01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:21.060]
It's made from durm similine, I beg your pardon?

[01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:21.940]
No soy what?

[01:26:24.740 --> 01:26:26.320]
Speak it in English, will you please?

[01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:30.760]
No soy gay, not this week, but I've heard it

[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:36.020]
5670560, pound 560 in the Verizon Singular wireless line

[01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:41.320]
I've got 45,000 very, very important stories here, but I would much rather talk to you folks

[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:42.200]
Wouldn't it be, don't you think?

[01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:48.720]
Yeah, let's see, I would rather hear the articulate, the poignant comments that you people have got to pass along

[01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:51.700]
WQAM, hello

[01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:54.860]
intellectual line

[01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:57.520]
WQAM, hello

[01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:01.120]
Now QAM, yes sir

[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:07.540]
Hey, I know it's all news, about a week or two ago you were talking about Rump Steel and so forth

[01:27:07.540 --> 01:27:11.140]
Didn't you leak it out that they actually did shoot down that plane in Pennsylvania?

[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:14.700]
No, he leaked it out

[01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:15.200]
Yeah, remember you did

[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:18.900]
Well he made a comment, he made the, it depends on how you interpret the comment

[01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:21.360]
Yes, it's on that loose change, go watch it again, yeah

[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:26.140]
There's one sentence that he said you can certainly interpret it that way

[01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:29.260]
But watch the movie, okay, it's on our website, hour and twenty minutes

[01:27:29.260 --> 01:27:34.720]
loose change part two, it's got the, you don't have to watch the first one because it's the second one's just the same with expanded the stuff

[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:36.080]
Additional footage

[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:38.380]
Do you think they're gonna watch it?

[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:38.740]
No

[01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:42.980]
No, and I have no way of finding it, and maybe Eric can pass it along to me

[01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:46.280]
Because he in the little little chat room, he's in the box, he was filling his fat face again

[01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:48.120]
There's another one man, and he's young

[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:50.860]
He has lost a lot of weight since the time he was a little bit older

[01:27:50.860 --> 01:27:55.300]
Thank God for that, Eric, you ought to be on that beam field stuff, you ought to have your lovely Japanese wife get that stuff

[01:27:55.300 --> 01:27:59.920]
And cook up a head, and don't eat too much of it, like George said, two ounces enough, he could smoke it by the end of the day

[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:02.180]
That's right, and when they get that rice going

[01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:05.300]
Yeah, and they said pay the, on the taters

[01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:08.000]
I love the taters

[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:09.440]
Me too

[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:14.700]
In fact, I don't know about, I don't think I ever had a Wendy's Bake Potato, we looked at chives and the sour cream

[01:28:14.700 --> 01:28:18.240]
I'm like crazy, but I like jyder, you gotta just drown it in stuff just to make it, you know

[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:21.680]
Yeah, but what about we always told you about that food that you have to like all the prices the same way

[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:23.700]
Although I do like pasta, like garlic and butter

[01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:27.160]
Oh, they're just butter and salt, man, and all the, I can eat my weight in it

[01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:27.660]
Could you?

[01:28:27.940 --> 01:28:30.780]
Yeah, of course I love my macaroni and cheese, I might get some of them elbows

[01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:34.360]
In fact, I might just share some cheese on my elbows at lunchtime

[01:28:35.340 --> 01:28:40.320]
Yeah, that's kind of looking, I wish I was double-jointed like Ron Jermon, obvious reasons

[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.240]
Do I have any QAM? Hello

[01:28:43.020 --> 01:28:45.020]
Yes, I love it, I want to speak to you

[01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:45.760]
Speaking

[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:47.820]
Hey, how are you doing?

[01:28:48.580 --> 01:28:49.200]
I'm good, great

[01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:55.040]
The other day, I decided to take you guys at first, the other day I rented a net work

[01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:57.300]
And, did you call us sleep?

[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.860]
No, it was the best advice

[01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:04.520]
I was mad at hell, I was thinking of you guys

[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:07.420]
And I opened up my window and began to say

[01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:08.440]
I'm good

[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:12.200]
Yeah, because I am mad as hell, and you know what I thought of it

[01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:18.080]
I treated myself for a new year's ease, I took a flight to Amsterdam

[01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:18.740]
Really?

[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:20.720]
And that was awesome

[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:21.480]
That was awesome

[01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:22.940]
Were you talking about that?

[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:28.520]
I said that at the Royal Hotel, the Royal Hotel was right there at Dam Square

[01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:30.420]
Oh, and that Dam Square, yeah

[01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:31.400]
And that Dam Square?

[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:33.580]
So you must have seen the Grand Cras de Poleskiy

[01:29:33.580 --> 01:29:37.240]
I saw all of it, and you know what I thought of it?

[01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:40.840]
You would take a few trips up the route of gasoline there, the warmest about

[01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:43.400]
And gasoline

[01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:43.780]
And gasoline in the car

[01:29:43.780 --> 01:29:46.080]
And light in the lights, in the car

[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:49.600]
I saw only three cops, you know what they were doing?

[01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:51.180]
They were saying, well, I thought they were talking each other drinking

[01:29:51.180 --> 01:29:51.720]
Right

[01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:57.520]
It was the best trip, and you know what, within a year I am getting my ass out of here

[01:29:58.460 --> 01:29:59.100]
Okay, okay

[01:29:59.100 --> 01:29:59.840]
I'll still be

[01:30:01.260 --> 01:30:02.580]
So team, do we?

[01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:04.600]
There you go, and there's a guy that went to Amsterdam and liked it

[01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:07.520]
I'll go back, I always get, I just ain't what he used to be

[01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:09.000]
Because there's too many Dutch people there

[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:12.000]
If they get rid of the Dutch people, let all the tourists come in there and have a fun time

[01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:14.420]
The Dutch are not fun people, you know what I mean?

[01:30:15.020 --> 01:30:15.620]
What it is?

[01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:19.760]
They're about as much fun people as the bush people are, it's just not fun, not a barrel of laughs

[01:30:20.420 --> 01:30:24.020]
And hey, and hey, everybody, you think the French hate everybody, the Dutch really hate everybody

[01:30:24.020 --> 01:30:24.880]
Oh, it's mad

[01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:27.420]
It's just the way they are, man

[01:30:28.420 --> 01:30:31.140]
And the fact that there's all that permissiveness, it's got nothing to do with them

[01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:33.360]
It's just their government, it has nothing to do with the Dutch people

[01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:37.820]
They are not, they're not liberal, they're not progressive, they're not friendly, they're just what they are

[01:30:37.820 --> 01:30:40.120]
They're slimy, they're like those noodles

[01:30:41.260 --> 01:30:42.980]
Remember noodles in that lotion-cogal?

[01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:46.220]
837, they don't like the Jews either, like the Swedes, they hate the Jews

[01:30:46.220 --> 01:30:48.680]
But then again, like that, that says everybody hates the Jews

[01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:51.920]
837 on a pool, we get to a thousand, you'll see

[01:30:52.260 --> 01:30:54.760]
If now we're staying on the air, we get to a thousand, who's on it too?

[01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:55.660]
Oh, Gelly, hold on

[01:30:56.920 --> 01:31:00.120]
He'll wait, he doesn't care, he's not a hard-nast like his predecessor

[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:02.740]
Femini QYM, hello

[01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:05.780]

Hey Neil, how are you?

[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:19.340]
Pretty good

[01:31:19.340 --> 01:31:23.180]
So how's the progress coming on the Florida bullet train?

[01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:29.320]
Call up your fat ass governor and ask him how it's coming, okay?

[01:31:30.700 --> 01:31:35.600]
It'll be here along with full fledg casino gambling in about two weeks, full fledg casino's craft

[01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:37.920]
In fact that's your governor's specialty is crafts

[01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:40.680]
Femini QYM, hello

[01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:42.700]
My share goes to her

[01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:45.500]
Femini QYM, hello

[01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:48.400]
Hey Uncle Neil, happy boy to 30th

[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:49.140]
Well thanks

[01:31:49.140 --> 01:31:53.880]
I was arriving in Amsterdam the day of the 30th, so I could say exactly

[01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:57.300]
When you guys go to Amsterdam, that's where the whole audience is, they're all playing games square

[01:31:57.300 --> 01:32:01.780]
I actually called George the week before I left, sorry George, no role

[01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:03.240]
Femini

[01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:06.660]
I looked around with no thanks, but I have to say

[01:32:06.660 --> 01:32:08.100]
You're going to give you 10 votes of peace for it

[01:32:08.100 --> 01:32:14.100]
Let me say George, Josh, it's heaven on earth, it's the best place in the planet

[01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:16.380]
You gotta get there, it's great

[01:32:16.380 --> 01:32:18.560]
The name is the best place in the planet

[01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:20.940]
Well, the shirt's held better than here

[01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:23.320]
Oh well, so is Wheeling West Virginia

[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:25.360]
Oh, no thank you

[01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:26.380]

[01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:32.340]
So is Ishmael, Michigan

[01:32:33.340 --> 01:32:36.960]
Well I just wanted to say that great city and have a great show tonight

[01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:37.920]
Where did you say?

[01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:39.240]
I'm in North Miami

[01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:42.320]
No, I mean now, I mean in Amsterdam, where did you say that?

[01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:44.940]
Oh, I say that the hotel intel?

[01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:46.920]

[01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:50.100]
Yeah, right across from the Betty Booth, great coffee shop

[01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:50.300]
Huh

Alright guys, okay thanks, lady had a good time

This dream field, Greenfield, Brothers 4

[01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:02.780]
What was the one we played yesterday?

[01:33:03.400 --> 01:33:04.380]
Oh the Kingston Trio

[01:33:04.940 --> 01:33:05.140]
That's right

[01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:33.980]
five seconds here, two seconds here. He's all right. He got me some tickets.

[01:34:33.980 --> 01:34:37.100]
so I'm going to be nice to him for the like other. I like him just fine.

[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:39.960]
he's nobody else digs. Joe Rose hated him and Moe of course hated him,

[01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:43.780]
but hated everybody else too. Right. And who else? And the for all was I want to remember kept

[01:34:43.780 --> 01:34:48.820]
I like about my show to be done. Yeah. Well, that's because the beast had those big numbers.

[01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:52.840]
Yeah, that was a belt. That was his belt size. Yeah.

[01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:54.920]
Now he's okay, but then of course there's always Robert.

[01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:57.420]
This is Neil Rogers.

[01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:00.180]
This is Neil Rogers.

[01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:29.720]
and that's why we did bedtime first because I know that the audience is composed of

[01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:33.240]
intellectual folks from I'll work I'll walk sublime. I'll work that's right. You know,

[01:36:33.340 --> 01:36:39.440]
speaking of lunatics, I just got an email from your friend in sales with new

[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:44.180]
dollar max his copy emails it. Well, guess what? I can't download it. We've gone through that

[01:36:44.180 --> 01:36:48.880]
before. Yeah, I don't think that that email okay. You can fax it. You can give it to George

[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:54.120]
and he'll fax it to me. I'm like a regular sheet of copy paper. That's why we do copy a WQAM

[01:36:54.120 --> 01:37:00.300]
where your life ain't worth a dime. Oh, look at me too. He did. I've already I've already told him

[01:37:00.300 --> 01:37:05.620]
that you're not interested in having a copy. Okay. I want a physical piece of copy. Now what's

[01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:10.320]
the story is he had worked working from the nursing home we can only pray? No, it's time yesterday

[01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:14.160]
today to add or in the world. Well, why isn't he capable of like bringing you and I realize

[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:18.880]
a great stress on his walker. Hey, I'm waddling around or Lee is shoving it out of the door

[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:23.420]
putting in a bottle and floating it up this game. I don't have to tell you how much effort is

[01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:28.100]
involved in getting up and going to the printer. Yeah, and waddling it over here. Right. He can

[01:37:28.100 --> 01:37:33.520]
die happily. Somebody else do it. Okay. This is what's going on and we got a new sales guy

[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:37.400]
back there and this was Joe Bells came to fame was that he was revitalizing and reorganizing

[01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:43.840]
the sales department. You've got to be Schmidt and me man. This is pathetic. Samo, what did I say before

[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:49.780]
back in January and February? What did I tell you? Monday Saturday. What did I say? The liars will

[01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:54.240]
continue to lie and the game players will continue to play games and guess what? The liars are continuing

[01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:58.980]
to lie and the game players are continuing to play little games like Clarence and Robert and the Beast

[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:06.300]
and Jeff hi, hi, although I do want to send a message. Hi, howdy. The him and his boyfriend out there.

[01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:12.080]
You still getting faxes from him by the way? Yes. No brother. See what I mean? Let's get a two

[01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:16.360]
for. Let's get a package deal. Only Reneerie were still around. Remember he had package deal.

[01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:21.520]
Over the road. He had been sixty three votes on the appol A. F. Rell had package deals too.

[01:38:21.620 --> 01:38:29.540]
Different kind of deal. Got him. A fire package. Thor. Yeah. Cash and carry. Man dies stuck in the mud

[01:38:29.540 --> 01:38:36.220]
after running from deputies. Dallas, Texas. Old stick in the mud. I mean, it wasn't really a big deal.

[01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:41.180]
Either a man running from a routine traffic stop early yesterday. Sank wasted deep in mud and

[01:38:41.180 --> 01:38:46.560]
apparently died of a document called while authorities tried to pull it out. Deputy stopped Sean

[01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:51.740]
E. LaFlor 33 for having an updated registration sticker. That sounds like that to McDuffy case in

[01:38:51.740 --> 01:38:56.780]
Tampa. Remember that years ago? Arthur McDuffy? I thought that was here. No, the riots were there.

[01:38:56.980 --> 01:39:01.160]
The McDuffy thing happened in Tampa. I thought it happened here. The riots were in Liberty City. You

[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:07.880]
better get your history straight now, Mr. Alright. He thought he was wanted. That's in fact to do a

[01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:13.280]
Google on it. Arthur. Okay. If I'm dying, you're lying. There's a giveaway round. If I'm lying,

[01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:18.400]
you're both dying. He thought he was wanted. That's why he ran. Perid said Sergeant Don Perid's

[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:21.420]
but it turns out he wasn't on a for anything except his driver's license was expired.

[01:39:23.220 --> 01:39:27.960]
The floor ran about 700 yards off the road where he got stuck in the mud. The weather was windy

[01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:32.780]
temperatures were in the upper 30s. The dark field which have been saturated by heavy rain.

[01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:37.160]
Deputy searched about an hour before finding one. Can the movies when you see people go into the

[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:42.280]
quicksand like that and disappear? They called for help and tried for another hour to pull them

[01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:48.880]
out. He died. He suffered from exhaustion exposure, toxicology, results pending. A passenger in

[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:52.560]
the forest vehicle was not injured. Well, thank the Lord for that. Thank you.

[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:58.260]
Deal good for that. Oh, look at that. How now? How did this magic become? Did he bring this into

[01:39:58.260 --> 01:40:02.840]
you? I told you he emailed it to me. Oh, and you and so you printed it out and so I printed it out.

[01:40:02.980 --> 01:40:06.460]
Thank you for the picture. It's amazing. Well, these are both the same or yeah, these are both the same,

[01:40:06.460 --> 01:40:12.940]
right? Yes. You just sent it twice to be extra nice. No, I always said it was. Well, it came out.

[01:40:13.020 --> 01:40:17.120]
It came twice. Well, just to be sure. That's it. I guess the facts machines on your end of my

[01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:22.780]
knew who we were doing with. Well, there you go. It only took a herniotic effort to get a change of

[01:40:22.780 --> 01:40:27.740]
copy after a month and a half. There you nice go on air out, Pauline. Also on a way. What's that?

[01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:33.320]
The Arthur McDuffer E story. There was not in Tampa? It was here. Like I said.

[01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:41.000]
No. And yes, I know I know mentioned this before, but you forgot very briefly. I did. I was here from Tampa.

[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:48.560]
I don't know. You got the story there. Not in a year. It's there. I briefly dated the secretary that

[01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:53.360]
worked with Janet Reno during that entire thing. And if you're asking wasn't I going to be dating the

[01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:58.900]
secretary? The answer is yes. Are you dating the secretary during the McDuffee ride? No, no, afterwards.

[01:40:59.460 --> 01:41:04.500]
And she got to transcribe this particular secretary got to transcribe all of the internal stuff.

[01:41:04.660 --> 01:41:09.260]
So she was going to be telling me why dating Janet Reno. Yes, we go way back me and Janet. Did you

[01:41:09.260 --> 01:41:14.560]
compare notes? Yeah, that little shakiness that she's got going? It ain't all bad.

[01:41:15.980 --> 01:41:22.240]
Arthur McDuffee died in 79 was an former insurance salesperson in Miami. Florida police

[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:27.420]
caused one of the worst rides in the US to the 80s Liberty City rides. McDuffee sold insurance.

[01:41:27.420 --> 01:41:30.900]
Had been a US Marine military police officer. He had two daughters and planned to marry his

[01:41:30.900 --> 01:41:33.680]
former wife and nurse when the incident happened. I told you if I'm lying, you're dying.

[01:41:34.820 --> 01:41:39.800]
On December 17, 1979, Dave police spotted him doing stunts on his motorcycle and McDuffee was

[01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:44.480]
unarmed. Led them in a high speed chase. I would have sworn it was in Tampa. When he stopped,

[01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:48.580]
what officers beat him into a coma? When reinforcements arrived, the officers lied,

[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:53.300]
saying McDuffee had been injured in a crash. Days later, he died from his beatings. Four officers

[01:41:53.300 --> 01:41:56.520]
were indebted in the case, three charged with manslaughter, one charged with secondary

[01:41:56.520 --> 01:42:01.160]
remurder. On May 17, 1980, an all-white jury reached a verdict that the four officers were not

[01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:05.480]
guilty. A riot started in which 18 people died, property damage is made $100 million.

[01:42:07.060 --> 01:42:11.120]
Of course, to show you, my twisted memory of history and fans. Sorry.

[01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:13.620]
I guess, guys, I'm going to hold you now far. Probably the diabetes, too.

[01:42:14.220 --> 01:42:18.180]
Oh, yeah, that must be it. My mind's getting a lot sharper now that I'm down to 187, man.

[01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:21.040]
I haven't given you a number like that in a long time. You're right about that.

[01:42:23.420 --> 01:42:28.800]
That's the lowest I've weighed in years. In years, Mr. Taylor. I still got a way to go, about

[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:33.160]
27 pounds. Got a fact from I-Dine who you don't want to hear from anymore? Yes, I don't.

[01:42:33.220 --> 01:42:37.460]
With the exact same thing that I just had. I-Dine on the hair. What? The exact same thing that I just

[01:42:37.460 --> 01:42:42.040]
had. From all the media. Go away, I-Dine. I-Dine. Get lost. Get out of our face.

[01:42:43.020 --> 01:42:46.240]
That's an inside. Then we figure out who that was last week. I-Dine.

[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:50.980]
Let me remind you. We might never get. Somebody, we know just like that Foni,

[01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:54.380]
thanks. I got that day from that law firm. What the hell was it? Cohen? Not Cohen and Cohen.

[01:42:54.660 --> 01:42:59.440]
Is that place? Remember that? No. About the quick talking about our blaming and hurricane

[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:04.820]
for the radium. Yeah. Yeah. Remember that? Yeah. That very familiar hand right in the chronic

[01:43:04.820 --> 01:43:08.960]
car from a car to the street. It was what? That was from across the street. Oh, I'm sure of that.

[01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:12.440]
I'm sure of that. We'll take a look at their fine numbers during the hurricane. So in other

[01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:17.420]
If the hurricane hadn't been with it, is that supposed to mean we had they had no audience during the month of November across the street?

[01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:22.340]
Everybody in their audience died and of course believe me if you turn on most of those shows you would too

[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:26.180]
OJ who you can see

[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:37.580]
Roger's God ever dreamed of being a past in 80s top star who now makes a full of herself every week on national television

[01:43:37.580 --> 01:43:43.700]
Well now you can with the fall that had been met yet a school of Brandon thought an info here at shiver jammer

[01:43:43.700 --> 01:43:48.040]
That's right in just three short weeks. We'll teach you how to stammer and

[01:43:56.420 --> 01:44:03.680]
We'll teach you how to stare blindly at the camera and flirt out of slurred rambling and totally disjointed sent him every from

[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:07.380]
Your stance and the moment you open up your mouth

[01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:24.880]
You're actually giving me a hesitate in the hatching the distant and embarrassment you'll create for your co-workers who are forced to sit next to you and behave as if nothing is wrong

[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:38.140]
I apologize. I apologize to America. I'm for your son at the polo

[01:44:38.140 --> 01:44:43.460]
Abdul Mednav School of Brandon thought an incoherent chipper. Just when you feel that you can get me worse

[01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:44.680]
You did call now

[01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:49.740]
1 800 chipper jammer, that's 1 800 chipper. Japper. Half forty five at five sixty

[01:44:49.740 --> 01:44:54.100]
I would have sworn in that air from WWE. There was from Tampa. There was some kind of a Tampa connection to that story

[01:44:54.100 --> 01:44:57.760]
I'll bet you anything about any amount you want. He probably had heard of Tampa

[01:44:58.460 --> 01:45:01.260]
No, maybe he went to Bernstake house once that likely

[01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:06.800]
880 votes on a pool which if we get to 900 by the top of the, or we should be good for

[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:10.520]
a thousand and don't, and don't forget it's very important because for every vote that

[01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:14.440]
we're short of a thousand at the end of each day on the show, for each vote that we're

[01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:17.140]
short, Josh gets a dollar subtracted from his monthly paycheck.

[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:17.920]
That's right.

[01:45:18.820 --> 01:45:22.200]
So if we have a bad week, it's going to be like, have a minus in front of it.

[01:45:22.900 --> 01:45:24.320]
I'm thinking of plus maybe.

[01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:25.500]
A minus.

[01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:28.320]
Well what happens if we get over a thousand?

[01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:30.100]
Well not partly a clearance fraternity.

[01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:31.220]
He's not a UM fan.

[01:45:31.420 --> 01:45:32.740]
He's not a, he's not Jewish.

[01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:37.720]
And he's not part of that little core of the guys that sit around in a circle and I

[01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:39.680]
am a UM fan but that's beside the point.

[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:40.320]
No you're not.

[01:45:40.700 --> 01:45:41.820]
A UM-1 football fan.

[01:45:42.140 --> 01:45:42.380]
I am.

[01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:44.320]
You like their perch easy team?

[01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:46.260]
Huh?

[01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:47.760]
How about a UM hockey team?

[01:45:48.780 --> 01:45:51.300]
Actually Miami of Ohio has got a very good hockey team.

[01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:53.300]
You know that there's a little trivia for it and not that you care.

[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:54.500]
Why do I stick in a hockey?

[01:45:54.500 --> 01:45:59.100]
We got Gjoljit too from the Yenthah center baby with Eric Reed talking to his teeth at

[01:45:59.100 --> 01:46:00.120]
330, the heat guy.

[01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:01.880]
Eric Reed talks to his teeth.

[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:07.420]
And then we got the mad dog at 4.0630, Panther previous 6.30 and the Panthers host the Washington

[01:46:07.420 --> 01:46:09.680]
Crapidels and Alexander Ovechkin.

[01:46:10.100 --> 01:46:11.640]
Don't be question if you don't see Ovechkin.

[01:46:11.860 --> 01:46:12.740]
He got Benzia the night.

[01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:15.580]
For being a jackass, playing a great player.

[01:46:16.060 --> 01:46:17.180]
I don't care what anybody writes.

[01:46:17.260 --> 01:46:17.600]
He's great.

[01:46:17.740 --> 01:46:19.260]
Alexander Ovechkin, you can go to see him.

[01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:20.100]
Okay.

[01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:22.340]
Well they're playing the Panthers and the Crapidels.

[01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:23.700]
They must game 7 o'clock tonight.

[01:46:23.860 --> 01:46:25.000]
Panthers are on fire.

[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:26.120]
Maybe they're smoking it.

[01:46:26.660 --> 01:46:27.780]
You go there for that.

[01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:28.360]
Sure.

[01:46:28.460 --> 01:46:33.980]
And on 1360, we got the Hurricane Warmup with Lair and Jettick are Clarence and Spastic

[01:46:33.980 --> 01:46:38.600]
Joe Zagaki on 1360, AMWKAT at 738 o'clock.

[01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:40.040]
Hurricane is in Michigan and IIT.

[01:46:40.420 --> 01:46:41.540]
Any K on 2A with 10?

[01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:43.320]
What a joke.

[01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:44.540]
It's only stations that have worked on.

[01:46:44.620 --> 01:46:48.280]
We're going to have to get like the program lineup for two different stations because we're

[01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:49.740]
always farming it out.

[01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:51.680]
That would be our billboard campaign.

[01:46:51.940 --> 01:46:52.540]
Farm out.

[01:46:54.300 --> 01:46:54.640]
887.

[01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:55.320]
Boy, I'm in heaven.

[01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:57.640]
We're going to make that 1000 just to show Josh the thing or two.

[01:46:57.740 --> 01:46:58.700]
You didn't think we could do it.

[01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:00.520]
You're going to be famous.

[01:47:01.260 --> 01:47:02.600]
I'm telling you, you had your doubts.

[01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:06.640]
You've seen me in action do this thing and force these people whether they want to or

[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:06.820]
not.

[01:47:07.540 --> 01:47:08.620]
They don't want to.

[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:09.660]
They don't want to.

[01:47:09.660 --> 01:47:12.900]
They don't want to get off their ass and go to the computer and got cast of vote on

[01:47:12.900 --> 01:47:13.080]
there.

[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:16.840]
You know, just for vote, none of his, what he says, pisses me off.

[01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:20.240]
That will help him keep it over 80% because if it goes under 80% we're all going to get

[01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:24.160]
fired because we don't want to piss off or then Joyce will get her stick her fine finger

[01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:24.700]
in the way.

[01:47:24.700 --> 01:47:26.140]
See, we're dating who we were dating.

[01:47:26.340 --> 01:47:27.040]
Jenner Reno's girlfriend.

[01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:28.300]
That's right.

[01:47:28.820 --> 01:47:29.220]
Wow.

[01:47:29.500 --> 01:47:30.120]
Make something up.

[01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:31.320]
Figure the better.

[01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:32.940]
Why I didn't understand what you said.

[01:47:33.100 --> 01:47:34.800]
The secretary of the Mac Duffy.

[01:47:34.860 --> 01:47:35.360]
One of the things.

[01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:37.120]
Listen, the state attorney has a secretary.

[01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:40.440]
You'll pull the state attorney has that which would have been Jenner Reno.

[01:47:41.380 --> 01:47:42.080]
Passed by Fernandez.

[01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:43.160]
Runway, we're dating her.

[01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:43.760]
That's right.

[01:47:44.140 --> 01:47:44.300]
Yeah.

[01:47:44.300 --> 01:47:46.420]
Those kids, those kids, hers, their mind.

[01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:48.840]
I said, we're always getting into trouble and getting arrested.

[01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:50.720]
But here's more about that good old time religion.

[01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:52.100]
By the way, that some of you are defending.

[01:47:52.260 --> 01:47:53.280]
We're not too happy with that.

[01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:56.220]
I don't see how many people, 31 people say they're most pissed off.

[01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:57.180]
My comments about religion.

[01:47:57.180 --> 01:47:57.660]
Well, you know what?

[01:47:58.100 --> 01:47:58.700]
Too bad.

[01:47:59.020 --> 01:47:59.280]
Raspberry.

[01:48:00.460 --> 01:48:01.820]
A big juicy raspberry.

[01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:02.900]
It's like a cream.

[01:48:02.900 --> 01:48:04.180]
It's like a godfart to me.

[01:48:04.940 --> 01:48:05.840]
It was not a fart.

[01:48:07.500 --> 01:48:11.080]
You know, you're just, I tell you, you're one step away from having Joyce come there

[01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:12.100]
and beat your ass with a club.

[01:48:12.580 --> 01:48:13.700]
I love to meet her.

[01:48:13.700 --> 01:48:14.900]
Yeah, but you would.

[01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:15.740]
I bet you she farts.

[01:48:15.980 --> 01:48:17.400]
I bet you she farts rancid.

[01:48:17.540 --> 01:48:18.360]
Oh my god.

[01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:21.360]
You would, you would just swoon like death.

[01:48:21.900 --> 01:48:25.660]
You would swoon if you were a small elevator like the one there at our building.

[01:48:25.860 --> 01:48:26.380]
They said that.

[01:48:26.460 --> 01:48:27.020]
They thought it's death.

[01:48:27.340 --> 01:48:29.960]
And she cuts some nasty, nasty elephantine cheese.

[01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:34.260]
You would be plastered against the side of the wall, gasping for an oxygen mask.

[01:48:34.420 --> 01:48:34.960]
I have no doubt.

[01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:36.740]
That's what I hear.

[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:37.760]
That's what Norma Kent said.

[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:39.920]
Since she farts up a storm right there at lunch.

[01:48:41.240 --> 01:48:43.400]
In the days of the Taliban, this is that religious.

[01:48:43.420 --> 01:48:47.040]
This is more on the story we had yesterday, but the agrarian probably going to get off

[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:49.100]
or at least is going to cause you would convert into Christianity.

[01:48:50.780 --> 01:48:54.320]
And thank God we got rid of the Taliban who were promoting freedom in democracy in

[01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:55.280]
Afghanistan and Iraq.

[01:48:55.640 --> 01:48:55.920]
That's right.

[01:48:56.260 --> 01:48:56.480]
Freedom in the Taliban.

[01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:01.540]
And the days of the Taliban, those promoting Christianity in Afghanistan could be arrested

[01:49:01.540 --> 01:49:04.880]
and those converting from Islam could be tortured and publicly executed.

[01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:06.920]
That was supposed to change after the U.S.

[01:49:07.070 --> 01:49:09.530]
that forces out to the oppressive fundamentalist regime.

[01:49:10.330 --> 01:49:14.750]
But the case of 41-year-old Abdul Rafman has many Western nations wondering if Afghanistan

[01:49:14.750 --> 01:49:15.790]
is regressing.

[01:49:15.970 --> 01:49:16.270]
Absolutely.

[01:49:16.690 --> 01:49:17.130]
Regressing.

[01:49:17.390 --> 01:49:19.330]
Louis in the wrong direction, kind of like Iraq.

[01:49:20.210 --> 01:49:20.650]
Regressing.

[01:49:21.110 --> 01:49:21.690]
Not progressing.

[01:49:22.370 --> 01:49:22.810]
Regressing.

[01:49:22.990 --> 01:49:24.630]
Like this radio station out of the new regime.

[01:49:26.090 --> 01:49:29.130]
Rafman, a father of two, was arrested and is on trial for rejecting Islam.

[01:49:29.790 --> 01:49:34.130]
The Afghan Constitution, which is based on Sharia or Islamic law, says that apostates can

[01:49:34.130 --> 01:49:34.970]
receive the death penalty.

[01:49:36.150 --> 01:49:39.610]
They want to sentence me to death and I have said that, Rafman told reporters last week,

[01:49:39.850 --> 01:49:41.450]
but I'm not a visitor, not an infidel.

[01:49:41.870 --> 01:49:42.690]
Do you like better?

[01:49:42.850 --> 01:49:43.630]
Fidel or the infidel?

[01:49:44.310 --> 01:49:45.130]
Oh, infidel's please.

[01:49:45.430 --> 01:49:48.750]
He had been arrested after telling local police and me a person unrelated matter that

[01:49:48.750 --> 01:49:49.670]
he converted to Christianity.

[01:49:50.050 --> 01:49:51.870]
Not a good choice, not a good idea, Abdul.

[01:49:52.650 --> 01:49:54.550]
Reports say he was carrying a Bible at the time.

[01:49:54.650 --> 01:49:55.510]
I need a worse idea.

[01:49:55.710 --> 01:49:56.290]
Oh my God.

[01:49:56.710 --> 01:50:00.370]
He said he converted to Christianity 16 years ago after working with a Christian aid

[01:50:00.370 --> 01:50:03.510]
group that assisted refugees in neighboring Pakistan.

[01:50:04.990 --> 01:50:08.490]
Yesterday, a state prosecutor said, Rahman may be mentally unfit to stand trial.

[01:50:09.150 --> 01:50:10.190]
We think he could be mad.

[01:50:10.670 --> 01:50:11.550]
He's not a normal person.

[01:50:11.650 --> 01:50:12.870]
He doesn't talk like a normal person.

[01:50:13.170 --> 01:50:18.910]
He if he quoted prosecutor, sorry, something rather a Zamariah saying, senior a Zamariah.

[01:50:19.090 --> 01:50:19.250]
Careful.

[01:50:20.490 --> 01:50:21.310]
Boy, I'm doing a balook.

[01:50:22.390 --> 01:50:22.810]
Balook?

[01:50:22.910 --> 01:50:24.010]
Balook, yeah, maybe he knows Eddie.

[01:50:24.890 --> 01:50:28.970]
A religious advisor to President Karzai said, Rahman, when I'd go a psychological exam,

[01:50:28.970 --> 01:50:30.570]
doctors must examine him.

[01:50:30.650 --> 01:50:33.410]
The AP quoted balook as saying, what if he's kind of Bernard Baruch?

[01:50:33.710 --> 01:50:33.950]
Balook?

[01:50:34.530 --> 01:50:37.470]
If he's mentally unfit, definitely Islam has no claim to punishing.

[01:50:37.470 --> 01:50:38.250]
We must be forgiven.

[01:50:38.370 --> 01:50:39.110]
The case must be dropped.

[01:50:39.350 --> 01:50:43.070]
But on the other hand, wow.

[01:50:44.010 --> 01:50:47.670]
Rahman's case raises thorny issues between Afghanistan and its Western allies.

[01:50:48.130 --> 01:50:51.390]
And US officials this week made certain that Afghan Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah

[01:50:52.270 --> 01:50:53.470]
who's in Washington for talks.

[01:50:53.470 --> 01:50:57.890]
He's a kind of Jose Hamanas who's in Washington for talks at the US Afghan Strategic Partnership.

[01:50:57.890 --> 01:50:58.890]
They understood their qualms.

[01:50:59.690 --> 01:51:00.610]
They have qualms.

[01:51:00.970 --> 01:51:01.370]
They have issues.

[01:51:02.770 --> 01:51:06.030]
We've underscored also to Foreign Minister Abdullah that we believe that telements in freedom

[01:51:06.030 --> 01:51:08.090]
and worship are important elements of a democracy.

[01:51:08.650 --> 01:51:11.670]
US State Department spokesman Scott McCormick told reporters to say, what's that going

[01:51:11.670 --> 01:51:12.290]
to start in America?

[01:51:13.250 --> 01:51:17.210]
We urge the Afghan government to conduct any legal proceedings in a transparent and fair

[01:51:17.210 --> 01:51:18.050]
manner.

[01:51:18.650 --> 01:51:19.150]
There you go.

[01:51:19.810 --> 01:51:20.550]
Freedom of religion.

[01:51:20.910 --> 01:51:22.910]
You say freedom of speech, freedom of religion in America.

[01:51:23.290 --> 01:51:24.510]
And now we're sending them all abroad.

[01:51:25.350 --> 01:51:27.730]
We're outsourcing jobs, outsourcing freedoms too.

[01:51:28.410 --> 01:51:31.070]
We don't have many more, but somewhere might, someday.

[01:51:31.770 --> 01:51:31.770]

[01:51:31.970 --> 01:51:33.190]
Now the good I want to know where yet.

[01:51:33.450 --> 01:51:34.150]
Maybe in Amsterdam.

[01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:36.210]
894 vote.

[01:51:36.330 --> 01:51:42.370]
We'll pass 900 this hour like Josh is sliding down a slippery slope on a toboggan.

[01:51:44.550 --> 01:51:44.950]
894.

[01:51:45.390 --> 01:51:47.650]
The religion one is, well, let's see, it's right behind politics.

[01:51:48.530 --> 01:51:50.230]
4.1% are pissed off.

[01:51:50.350 --> 01:51:51.150]
I'm like, come on, it's too bad.

[01:51:51.230 --> 01:51:51.930]
Those are the Bush people.

[01:51:51.930 --> 01:51:54.070]
What is it going to take?

[01:51:54.070 --> 01:51:54.650]
Who did more?

[01:51:55.350 --> 01:51:55.430]
Huh?

[01:51:56.350 --> 01:51:59.110]
My God, when are you going to wake up and sniff the pansies already?

[01:51:59.230 --> 01:52:01.130]
What is wrong with you people for crying out loud?

[01:52:01.510 --> 01:52:05.150]
How long can you get lied to and sold a bill of goods before?

[01:52:05.250 --> 01:52:06.250]
I mean, are we that stupid?

[01:52:06.490 --> 01:52:07.230]
Are you going to get any out of it?

[01:52:07.230 --> 01:52:07.610]
Absolutely.

[01:52:07.950 --> 01:52:08.450]
That naive?

[01:52:08.750 --> 01:52:09.150]
Absolutely.

[01:52:09.470 --> 01:52:09.990]
That gullible?

[01:52:10.090 --> 01:52:10.430]
Absolutely.

[01:52:10.750 --> 01:52:12.190]
Hey, Scott, almighty.

[01:52:14.190 --> 01:52:14.590]
Christ.

[01:52:15.930 --> 01:52:18.570]
4.1% of this audience is still hanging on.

[01:52:18.730 --> 01:52:20.370]
Oh, gee, you're picking on our president.

[01:52:20.370 --> 01:52:21.290]
He's our president.

[01:52:21.330 --> 01:52:22.470]
We have to support the truth, you.

[01:52:22.690 --> 01:52:23.670]
How come you hate America?

[01:52:25.910 --> 01:52:26.810]
I'll tell you one thing.

[01:52:27.070 --> 01:52:29.190]
What I hate is that 4.1%.

[01:52:29.190 --> 01:52:30.850]
The number of them sawdust.

[01:52:31.430 --> 01:52:33.370]
The number of them in a box of lilacs.

[01:52:34.970 --> 01:52:37.130]
Gour, not planning to run for president, speaking of presidents.

[01:52:38.270 --> 01:52:38.990]
Lock locks.

[01:52:39.470 --> 01:52:45.630]
Former vice president, Al Gore, who invented the Internet, says this week he's not planning to run for president in 2008,

[01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:47.330]
but has ruled out a future in politics.

[01:52:47.970 --> 01:52:49.570]
I enjoy what I'm doing.

[01:52:49.710 --> 01:52:55.710]
He told an audience at Middle Tennessee State University in Murphy's Bro, where he gave a lecture on global warming, one in a series.

[01:52:56.650 --> 01:52:58.010]
I'm not planning to be a candidate again.

[01:52:58.110 --> 01:53:01.570]
I haven't reached the stage in my life where I'm willing to say I'll never consider something like this.

[01:53:01.690 --> 01:53:03.270]
He said, but I'm not saying that to be coy.

[01:53:03.730 --> 01:53:04.750]
I'm just saying that to be honest.

[01:53:05.030 --> 01:53:06.010]
That I haven't reached that point.

[01:53:06.650 --> 01:53:07.890]
That's to be coy, you understand.

[01:53:09.410 --> 01:53:11.010]
Gour, I Democrat, no less it says.

[01:53:11.090 --> 01:53:13.570]
Here, lost the electoral votes of George W. on the fixed election.

[01:53:13.570 --> 01:53:14.430]
Who do we know that?

[01:53:14.430 --> 01:53:20.270]
Some Democrats still keep him in mind for another presidential run, and a credit earlier polls on potential candidates.

[01:53:20.270 --> 01:53:21.470]
He's not doing so bad.

[01:53:21.950 --> 01:53:33.050]
Since his last Gour, who turns 58 next week, not so old, has occasionally the word speeches on global warming and other political issues, often criticizing Bush policies, including that one ass ripping speech.

[01:53:34.050 --> 01:53:44.410]
How dare they drag the good things of the United States of America through the mud of Saddam Hussein's torture and the war.

[01:53:44.410 --> 01:53:45.610]
How do you like that?

[01:53:45.910 --> 01:53:51.790]
A tipper must have tickled his fancy than I before made that speech, but he sounded like he was actually awake in alert and animated and motivated.

[01:53:52.510 --> 01:53:56.550]
He also co-founded a useless TV network current TV, which started in August.

[01:53:56.930 --> 01:53:58.730]
Mostly, teachers, documentaries by unfilmakers.

[01:53:58.730 --> 01:54:02.810]
Remember that was supposed to be a liberal station that counteracted like Fox and all the other pages news we get.

[01:54:03.030 --> 01:54:03.890]
No, but it was not.

[01:54:04.430 --> 01:54:05.410]
And it ain't.

[01:54:06.030 --> 01:54:10.050]
And inconvenient truth, the documentary on Gour's Global War and the Awareness Campaign premiered this year.

[01:54:11.490 --> 01:54:12.490]
Like just a whole election.

[01:54:12.630 --> 01:54:18.370]
How can you respect that, man, who stood up there in the Senate, presiding over the Senate as VP, banging the gavel on that black conque.

[01:54:19.390 --> 01:54:21.290]
And telling them basically we're all F off.

[01:54:21.610 --> 01:54:23.390]
Just like that thing with the fat people, the same thing.

[01:54:23.790 --> 01:54:24.150]
F off.

[01:54:25.550 --> 01:54:26.010]
Sit down.

[01:54:26.250 --> 01:54:26.810]
Sit down.

[01:54:26.930 --> 01:54:28.250]
You're out of order and he's banging the gavel.

[01:54:28.530 --> 01:54:30.890]
I'm telling you, some of these people I think, I could be wrong.

[01:54:31.330 --> 01:54:34.210]
I think some of these people were made an offer they couldn't refuse.

[01:54:34.350 --> 01:54:35.550]
You think so.

[01:54:35.550 --> 01:54:38.450]
After two face deletions, I have no evidence of it.

[01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:39.490]
I have no proof.

[01:54:39.770 --> 01:54:42.510]
It just being the suspicious and paranoid individual line.

[01:54:42.610 --> 01:54:43.910]
We got 900 votes by the way.

[01:54:43.950 --> 01:54:44.570]
Nice going guys.

[01:54:44.690 --> 01:54:45.430]
Totally we can do it.

[01:54:45.770 --> 01:54:46.290]
Piece of cake.

[01:54:46.730 --> 01:54:51.030]
We'll pass a thousand like George rolling up a big fat one in the hero.

[01:54:51.270 --> 01:54:52.510]
Actually, I don't allow the roller.

[01:54:52.630 --> 01:54:53.790]
I have people to do that for me.

[01:54:53.870 --> 01:54:55.450]
Oh, the Holy Roller.

[01:54:55.630 --> 01:54:56.010]
That's right.

[01:54:56.110 --> 01:54:56.910]
Maybe that's what you need.

[01:54:57.290 --> 01:54:59.410]
For salvation, George needs a Holy Roller.

[01:54:59.610 --> 01:54:59.990]
That's right.

[01:55:00.330 --> 01:55:01.390]
Sometimes bring your own piece of paper.

[01:55:01.390 --> 01:55:02.990]
Make sure you put your own piece of paper here.

[01:55:04.030 --> 01:55:06.250]
Just like in that great movie that I had you watch.

[01:55:06.250 --> 01:55:07.070]
What's the name of that movie?

[01:55:07.190 --> 01:55:08.530]
I can never think of Woodsegrorney Weaver.

[01:55:09.150 --> 01:55:10.010]
Oh, imaginary heroes.

[01:55:10.150 --> 01:55:10.310]
Yeah.

[01:55:10.830 --> 01:55:11.570]
Where she went in there.

[01:55:11.810 --> 01:55:13.910]
That's very first she went in the convenience store to get the papers.

[01:55:14.230 --> 01:55:17.890]
And he gave her that little bit of the cigar and told her to hollow it out and cut it in half.

[01:55:18.170 --> 01:55:18.170]

[01:55:18.270 --> 01:55:19.790]
She rolled a really big fat one.

[01:55:19.790 --> 01:55:21.130]
Oh, that's so funny that you should mention that.

[01:55:21.230 --> 01:55:25.310]
Just yesterday I'm sitting behind a pickup truck waiting for a red light coming here as a matter of fact.

[01:55:25.970 --> 01:55:28.510]
And the two Jamaican guys sitting in the back on the way to work.

[01:55:28.530 --> 01:55:29.830]
And one of them was doing just that.

[01:55:30.010 --> 01:55:30.730]
He was hollowing out.

[01:55:31.090 --> 01:55:32.290]
And the cigar and rolling up a blunt.

[01:55:32.690 --> 01:55:33.190]
I'll be damned.

[01:55:33.330 --> 01:55:34.970]
And I was listening to Ray Gay music at the time.

[01:55:35.630 --> 01:55:37.150]
Well, I feel unnatural.

[01:55:37.410 --> 01:55:38.370]
Oh, I speak out of that.

[01:55:38.750 --> 01:55:43.110]
I speak out of little anecdotes for anecdotes.

[01:55:43.870 --> 01:55:46.070]
So last night I met Woodbine, plunging on my machine mine.

[01:55:47.050 --> 01:55:49.590]
And that come next to me with some machine now.

[01:55:49.630 --> 01:55:50.510]
And I was like in and out.

[01:55:51.010 --> 01:55:52.290]
Here comes a young black guy.

[01:55:52.490 --> 01:55:53.530]
And not a real dark black.

[01:55:53.690 --> 01:55:54.570]
But I don't know what he was.

[01:55:54.750 --> 01:55:55.750]
Nor do I carry a nice guy.

[01:55:55.930 --> 01:55:57.430]
But I'd say about 30.

[01:55:57.810 --> 01:55:58.730]
About 30, man.

[01:55:59.290 --> 01:56:03.410]
And he sits down and within, you know, he puts in his $20 bill and gets to spend $125.

[01:56:04.350 --> 01:56:07.930]
So within seconds, because all I've told you, this all of the progressive machines are connected.

[01:56:08.190 --> 01:56:11.890]
So very often you get similar spins from different machines to the other.

[01:56:12.010 --> 01:56:12.290]
Very rarely.

[01:56:13.090 --> 01:56:14.830]
So I get to spend about 36 later.

[01:56:14.970 --> 01:56:15.890]
And of course it's 125.

[01:56:16.450 --> 01:56:19.330]
And I felt, because he was, we were talking a little bit.

[01:56:19.430 --> 01:56:20.910]
And I felt I wanted to say it.

[01:56:20.910 --> 01:56:22.230]
I almost did, but I didn't say it.

[01:56:23.110 --> 01:56:24.170]
Monkey see monkey do.

[01:56:25.570 --> 01:56:27.050]
Oh, that would have been, yeah.

[01:56:27.550 --> 01:56:28.110]
Meaning me.

[01:56:28.210 --> 01:56:29.070]
In other words, yeah, yeah.

[01:56:29.190 --> 01:56:30.790]
In other words, he got to 125 first.

[01:56:30.870 --> 01:56:31.310]
And I got it.

[01:56:31.390 --> 01:56:33.950]
Now that would, or maybe you see what I'm saying?

[01:56:34.110 --> 01:56:34.690]
I got bored.

[01:56:35.010 --> 01:56:35.350]
I got bored.

[01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:35.850]
I got bored.

[01:56:37.150 --> 01:56:37.870]
And I did.

[01:56:37.950 --> 01:56:38.790]
I didn't say it.

[01:56:39.450 --> 01:56:41.210]
Would that have been bad in bad style?

[01:56:41.990 --> 01:56:44.070]
It probably could have been this construed.

[01:56:44.430 --> 01:56:45.430]
That's when I was afraid of.

[01:56:46.310 --> 01:56:47.550]
See, you have to be so careful.

[01:56:47.710 --> 01:56:49.190]
I mean, he didn't seem like the kind of guy.

[01:56:49.210 --> 01:56:50.310]
He seemed like he had a good sense of you.

[01:56:50.390 --> 01:56:51.490]
And where I mean was talking to me, you know.

[01:56:52.770 --> 01:56:55.750]
But I just, it's just that I would not have been cool to say that.

[01:56:55.750 --> 01:56:57.410]
What a, no, no.

[01:56:57.770 --> 01:56:59.990]
So for once, for once in my life, I did the right thing.

[01:57:00.150 --> 01:57:01.230]
But you can always say monkey do.

[01:57:03.390 --> 01:57:05.670]
No, that's what it smells like the future is down.

[01:57:06.330 --> 01:57:08.150]
This is Neil Rogers.

[01:57:09.370 --> 01:57:10.950]
This is the puri-bond.

[01:57:11.350 --> 01:57:12.670]
You know, please, we're grandson.

[01:57:14.150 --> 01:57:15.710]
So let me do our.

[01:57:25.970 --> 01:57:28.430]
Do by parts world.

[01:57:28.650 --> 01:57:29.290]
Chef Corp.

[01:57:29.550 --> 01:57:31.410]
The United Arab Emirates.

[01:57:31.670 --> 01:57:33.450]
In the Middle East, seriously.

[01:57:34.130 --> 01:57:35.190]
Hey, don't worry.

[01:57:35.630 --> 01:57:37.930]
We're good at recognizing terrorism.

[01:57:38.630 --> 01:57:40.490]
Oh, hello Abdul.

[01:57:41.470 --> 01:57:42.510]
Hi, Mohamed.

[01:57:43.050 --> 01:57:45.610]
Hey, I need to check your cargo container.

[01:57:45.610 --> 01:57:46.990]
Very carefully.

[01:57:49.010 --> 01:57:51.170]
I hear something thinking.

[01:57:51.870 --> 01:57:54.590]
What have you got in there, my friend?

[01:57:55.190 --> 01:57:56.590]
And how are you?

[01:57:56.870 --> 01:57:56.890]
What?

[01:57:57.670 --> 01:57:58.310]
Excellent.

[01:57:58.890 --> 01:57:59.730]
Come ashore.

[01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:01.210]
Chef, Chef, Chef.

[01:58:02.690 --> 01:58:04.570]
Do by parts world.

[01:58:04.930 --> 01:58:09.390]
When it comes to safe port operations, we are all as you need.

[01:58:09.790 --> 01:58:13.230]
Coming soon, Mexican drug lords will take over border security.

[01:58:13.230 --> 01:58:16.490]
And Michael Jackson will oversee no child left behind.

[01:58:16.630 --> 01:58:17.090]
Oh, right.

[01:58:17.350 --> 01:58:20.310]
One o'clock at 5.60 WQ Amnesty, Gildey War, I'm sure.

[01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:22.150]
We've already got Ray Verol and Panther hysteria.

[01:58:22.270 --> 01:58:22.710]
Are you ready?

[01:58:22.870 --> 01:58:22.970]
No.

[01:58:23.110 --> 01:58:23.570]
Do you care?

[01:58:23.730 --> 01:58:23.910]
No.

[01:58:25.110 --> 01:58:25.870]
WQA M. Hello.

[01:58:26.530 --> 01:58:27.150]
Listen, Neil.

[01:58:27.510 --> 01:58:27.930]
Yes, sir.

[01:58:28.350 --> 01:58:33.730]
Neil, I want to try to say to George if he got, if he rented a man by the dog yet or what.

[01:58:33.990 --> 01:58:34.870]
No, no, I haven't.

[01:58:35.070 --> 01:58:35.810]
Why not, bro?

[01:58:36.150 --> 01:58:36.890]
I'm Stase Cadet.

[01:58:37.590 --> 01:58:39.990]
Hey, everybody loves Canadians, right?

[01:58:40.990 --> 01:58:41.570]
A ledge.

[01:58:42.030 --> 01:58:43.710]
And I love large Puerto Rican.

[01:58:44.470 --> 01:58:44.910]
Okay, good.

[01:58:45.530 --> 01:58:46.990]
5.607, and one of your was Pajas.

[01:58:47.890 --> 01:58:49.750]
5.607, oh, maybe they're on Crystal meth.

[01:58:50.170 --> 01:58:53.090]
That's what they keep telling us on TV now is that everybody's doing Crystal meth.

[01:58:53.490 --> 01:58:54.610]
I don't know anybody who's doing it.

[01:58:54.730 --> 01:58:57.230]
Yeah, like people on TV know what people are doing.

[01:58:57.550 --> 01:58:57.670]
Right.

[01:58:57.770 --> 01:58:57.910]
Yeah.

[01:58:58.270 --> 01:58:59.930]
I know I don't know anyone.

[01:59:00.230 --> 01:59:01.490]
Other than you're in your house.

[01:59:01.610 --> 01:59:02.370]
Is or has.

[01:59:02.730 --> 01:59:03.810]
No, that's just people doing Crystal.

[01:59:04.570 --> 01:59:04.790]
Oh.

[01:59:05.770 --> 01:59:07.030]
Well, that sure leaves you out.

[01:59:07.270 --> 01:59:07.690]
Yes, sir.

[01:59:08.350 --> 01:59:11.270]
5.607, oh, 5.60, pound 5.60.

[01:59:11.370 --> 01:59:12.790]
Well, you talk about opening up and doing it.

[01:59:12.790 --> 01:59:13.990]
You can have a Mac truck through it.

[01:59:14.110 --> 01:59:14.910]
I was really not going to.

[01:59:14.990 --> 01:59:16.090]
Call the set up in the end.

[01:59:16.090 --> 01:59:17.450]
pound 5.60, you know what's now?

[01:59:17.630 --> 01:59:19.850]
We had the only set up we got is in that sales department.

[01:59:20.070 --> 01:59:20.710]
Boy, oh boy.

[01:59:21.070 --> 01:59:22.770]
I'd like to have a set up right here.

[01:59:23.630 --> 01:59:23.950]
Good.

[01:59:24.190 --> 01:59:24.390]
God.

[01:59:25.130 --> 01:59:26.590]
And then this was the claim to fame.

[01:59:26.690 --> 01:59:27.310]
This was the new regime.

[01:59:27.350 --> 01:59:29.770]
This is what they were going to like really reorganize and get a real.

[01:59:30.030 --> 01:59:32.390]
It's only March 20, a second for quite a lot.

[01:59:34.590 --> 01:59:35.230]
Oh, man.

[01:59:35.670 --> 01:59:37.290]
What are you people thinking about?

[01:59:38.050 --> 01:59:40.610]
I think next time I go to Italy, I'm going to take a box of my.

[01:59:41.270 --> 01:59:42.370]
Tossed along with me.

[01:59:43.830 --> 01:59:45.070]
They never do it.

[01:59:45.250 --> 01:59:46.270]
They would never get any record.

[01:59:46.610 --> 01:59:47.130]
They're your cookies.

[01:59:47.150 --> 01:59:48.510]
The rest of it say, hey, cook this way.

[01:59:48.630 --> 01:59:49.470]
You're cooked or you're possibly.

[01:59:49.770 --> 01:59:49.770]

[01:59:49.950 --> 01:59:50.530]
Cheese inside.

[01:59:50.670 --> 01:59:52.130]
Oh, let's say buff on do.

[01:59:52.630 --> 01:59:53.030]
Exactly.

[01:59:53.350 --> 01:59:53.930]
Fondue is right.

[01:59:54.010 --> 01:59:55.590]
Speaking of fondue, how's that doing?

[01:59:56.710 --> 01:59:57.110]
WNQAM.

[01:59:57.250 --> 01:59:57.390]
Hello.

[01:59:59.450 --> 01:59:59.850]
WNQAM.

[01:59:59.970 --> 02:00:00.150]
Hola.

[02:00:01.830 --> 02:00:02.230]
Hola.

[02:00:02.230 --> 02:00:02.330]
I'm.

[02:00:02.410 --> 02:00:02.790]
K.A.M.

[02:00:03.290 --> 02:00:03.390]
Yes.

[02:00:03.390 --> 02:00:04.690]
How are you doing, Neil?

[02:00:05.190 --> 02:00:05.210]
OK.

[02:00:05.730 --> 02:00:09.530]
The reason you remember Tampa is they sent the trial to Tampa.

[02:00:10.370 --> 02:00:10.910]
That's it.

[02:00:11.050 --> 02:00:13.230]
Now you know, all the jury was in Tampa.

[02:00:13.590 --> 02:00:13.890]
That's right.

[02:00:13.890 --> 02:00:15.590]
They found the cops not guilty.

[02:00:15.850 --> 02:00:15.990]
Right.

[02:00:16.130 --> 02:00:16.990]
It sent the riot.

[02:00:17.470 --> 02:00:19.150]
See, I knew I wasn't completely losing my mind.

[02:00:19.210 --> 02:00:20.970]
I didn't know the time I had it's finger in it somewhere.

[02:00:21.730 --> 02:00:22.070]
All right.

[02:00:22.410 --> 02:00:23.030]
Thanks, Ada.

[02:00:23.170 --> 02:00:24.610]
Now I feel better about my brain.

[02:00:24.610 --> 02:00:26.910]
See, I knew Tampa was involved in somewhere.

[02:00:26.990 --> 02:00:27.970]
The trial was in Tampa.

[02:00:28.190 --> 02:00:28.550]
That's right.

[02:00:29.070 --> 02:00:31.850]
But it was the result of the trial that pissed everybody off in Liberty City.

[02:00:31.850 --> 02:00:34.070]
And that's why they went out there and did their thing, man.

[02:00:34.170 --> 02:00:35.790]
And it was horrendous.

[02:00:37.510 --> 02:00:39.770]
And then I remember right now, it seems to me.

[02:00:40.950 --> 02:00:43.250]
I'm trying to think back to the day, but I was on INZ.

[02:00:43.330 --> 02:00:44.070]
And that's years later.

[02:00:45.370 --> 02:00:46.490]
Maybe they had nothing to do with that one.

[02:00:46.550 --> 02:00:47.950]
Did we have other riots in the 80s?

[02:00:48.390 --> 02:00:49.070]
Lately 80s?

[02:00:49.570 --> 02:00:49.950]
I don't know.

[02:00:49.970 --> 02:00:50.610]
I was out of time.

[02:00:51.030 --> 02:00:51.590]
I'm sure we did.

[02:00:51.730 --> 02:00:52.770]
No, I have to absolutely we did.

[02:00:53.030 --> 02:00:55.230]
Because I remember when I first went on to INZ at night.

[02:00:56.210 --> 02:00:59.850]
I remember reading some article and it's sitting there screaming and couldn't buy a call.

[02:00:59.970 --> 02:01:01.610]
I mean, it couldn't buy a call.

[02:01:01.930 --> 02:01:04.710]
Hey Richard, we don't need a four page fast about the McDuffy thing, man.

[02:01:04.990 --> 02:01:06.670]
Oh, enough with McDuffy already.

[02:01:06.870 --> 02:01:07.750]
He's still dead, okay?

[02:01:08.030 --> 02:01:09.890]
And then let's sleeping dollars lie.

[02:01:10.310 --> 02:01:12.830]
Let's sleeping insurance sales holes lie.

[02:01:13.830 --> 02:01:14.270]
God.

[02:01:14.950 --> 02:01:16.050]
What is wrong with these people?

[02:01:16.150 --> 02:01:17.410]
I'm so sorry I brought that up again.

[02:01:19.970 --> 02:01:21.130]
Four pages, huh?

[02:01:21.370 --> 02:01:21.910]
That's what you needed.

[02:01:22.570 --> 02:01:25.490]
And all about how the trial was in Tampa, which we just like called.

[02:01:25.890 --> 02:01:27.250]
Yeah, the guys just understand about five seconds, okay?

[02:01:27.250 --> 02:01:28.290]
Okay, trial was in Tampa.

[02:01:28.370 --> 02:01:29.150]
That was the Tampa connection.

[02:01:29.150 --> 02:01:29.970]
Thank you.

[02:01:30.670 --> 02:01:31.150]
God.

[02:01:31.710 --> 02:01:32.750]
W.A.M., hello?

[02:01:33.250 --> 02:01:33.610]
Me, hello.

[02:01:33.890 --> 02:01:34.370]
Good.

[02:01:34.810 --> 02:01:36.310]
Do you want to suggest something to the poll?

[02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:37.010]
No.

[02:01:37.610 --> 02:01:38.070]
Patients?

[02:01:39.930 --> 02:01:40.410]
Patients.

[02:01:40.710 --> 02:01:41.090]
Patients.

[02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:43.350]
Comments about Haitians.

[02:01:43.810 --> 02:01:44.890]
Just Haitians in general.

[02:01:45.770 --> 02:01:47.550]
This is the Haitian hating guy.

[02:01:48.150 --> 02:01:48.530]
Oh, really?

[02:01:48.830 --> 02:01:49.550]
Get out of here.

[02:01:49.630 --> 02:01:50.110]
Go away.

[02:01:50.550 --> 02:01:51.810]
Go away, okay?

[02:01:52.430 --> 02:01:55.050]
I don't think Greg, you have like James Woods in the back of a garbage truck.

[02:01:56.210 --> 02:01:57.190]
One of them, Jitney.

[02:01:57.330 --> 02:01:59.230]
So I hope they put you in Michael Putty on a Jitney.

[02:02:00.790 --> 02:02:02.130]
Michael Orange has you so boring.

[02:02:02.330 --> 02:02:02.750]
Oh, God.

[02:02:02.810 --> 02:02:04.310]
He is so pedantic and so boring.

[02:02:04.590 --> 02:02:06.370]
Although not as pedantic as Walt Blitzkrieg.

[02:02:07.410 --> 02:02:08.370]
That's God of the...

[02:02:08.370 --> 02:02:10.110]
That's God of Jack Paparity now.

[02:02:10.370 --> 02:02:11.870]
We're here in the situation, Ro.

[02:02:11.950 --> 02:02:14.090]
That's the toughest thing about waiting for Lou Dobbs to come on.

[02:02:14.190 --> 02:02:14.690]
Is that what it was?

[02:02:15.050 --> 02:02:16.830]
Well, first of all, you're still watching Lou Dobbs?

[02:02:16.850 --> 02:02:17.430]
What are you doing?

[02:02:17.430 --> 02:02:17.510]
What are you doing?

[02:02:17.710 --> 02:02:18.270]
Are you nuts?

[02:02:18.590 --> 02:02:18.830]
Yeah.

[02:02:19.250 --> 02:02:20.730]
Yeah, Randy Rhodes on last night.

[02:02:21.390 --> 02:02:22.070]
And, yeah.

[02:02:22.130 --> 02:02:22.910]
And, who else?

[02:02:22.910 --> 02:02:23.370]
I don't know.

[02:02:23.370 --> 02:02:24.810]
She, which you there doing, she was there,

[02:02:25.590 --> 02:02:28.110]
herming and lying and, you know, trying to say all the right things.

[02:02:28.250 --> 02:02:29.990]
He gave her some decent air time.

[02:02:30.070 --> 02:02:31.750]
She was on there with a whole bunch of other talk show hosts.

[02:02:32.050 --> 02:02:32.190]
Yeah.

[02:02:32.290 --> 02:02:34.750]
And he almost exclusively only spoke to her.

[02:02:35.270 --> 02:02:36.350]
Real her some reason, yeah.

[02:02:36.650 --> 02:02:37.450]
She was really chick.

[02:02:37.850 --> 02:02:38.610]
Maybe that's the reason.

[02:02:38.710 --> 02:02:38.730]
I see.

[02:02:38.730 --> 02:02:39.950]
I must have been a re-who else was on.

[02:02:40.270 --> 02:02:40.650]
I don't know.

[02:02:42.290 --> 02:02:43.750]
I can't name another talk.

[02:02:43.750 --> 02:02:44.770]
I was like those guys yet.

[02:02:44.850 --> 02:02:47.750]
And last week, I've heard of before, I was like that.

[02:02:48.150 --> 02:02:48.150]

[02:02:48.630 --> 02:02:49.910]
People have seen me before.

[02:02:49.950 --> 02:02:51.830]
I mean, I think I should have gotten to be on National TV again, screaming.

[02:02:52.650 --> 02:02:53.150]
That's good.

[02:02:53.970 --> 02:02:55.930]
Now, if she policies off nights a little bit more,

[02:02:55.990 --> 02:02:57.150]
uses more of my drop-ins.

[02:02:57.650 --> 02:02:58.850]
Did she, did she, you play...

[02:02:58.850 --> 02:02:59.950]
I'm dying out of here.

[02:03:00.050 --> 02:03:00.850]
No drop.

[02:03:01.030 --> 02:03:01.710]
She was boxless.

[02:03:02.130 --> 02:03:02.330]
No.

[02:03:03.150 --> 02:03:04.430]
No, that's not anything new.

[02:03:06.710 --> 02:03:07.750]
927 votes on the pool.

[02:03:07.810 --> 02:03:09.290]
We got a real good shot at that thousand.

[02:03:09.330 --> 02:03:11.710]
You people need to lean on that thing on theoriders.com.

[02:03:11.990 --> 02:03:13.050]
And take a look at that Dreamfield.

[02:03:13.170 --> 02:03:14.110]
It's not a sponsor yet.

[02:03:14.210 --> 02:03:15.070]
And probably never will be.

[02:03:15.130 --> 02:03:15.930]
But I don't care about that.

[02:03:16.070 --> 02:03:17.390]
We're not doing that for the money.

[02:03:18.390 --> 02:03:20.690]
For once in my life, we're trying to spread the news.

[02:03:20.690 --> 02:03:21.590]
Well, I've always done that.

[02:03:21.670 --> 02:03:22.670]
We're doing it for love, not money.

[02:03:23.190 --> 02:03:25.430]
You know, whether it was a Ben and Jerry's, a fish food,

[02:03:25.590 --> 02:03:28.750]
whether it was a bagel bites, whether what I don't know what I'm going to want.

[02:03:29.770 --> 02:03:31.410]
And usually that's what we got in return.

[02:03:31.470 --> 02:03:32.270]
It was a bite in the ass.

[02:03:32.390 --> 02:03:33.050]
We never got nothing new.

[02:03:33.850 --> 02:03:36.090]
We got the bokeh burgers on the urn, eventually, remember that?

[02:03:36.590 --> 02:03:36.830]
Right.

[02:03:37.890 --> 02:03:40.090]
Dreamfield's low-car pasta right above OJ.

[02:03:40.270 --> 02:03:42.690]
I mean, right above Osama, whichever one that happens to be at the moment.

[02:03:43.790 --> 02:03:46.270]
That's a beautiful likeness of OJ, by the way.

[02:03:47.570 --> 02:03:48.870]
Two obnoxious murderers.

[02:03:49.610 --> 02:03:51.850]
Both be viled by anybody with a brain.

[02:03:52.870 --> 02:03:55.130]
And of course, the second one, OJ,

[02:03:55.690 --> 02:03:58.090]
admired by certain individuals inside of our Q&M building.

[02:03:58.510 --> 02:04:00.430]
Like I said, I qualified anybody with a brain.

[02:04:01.250 --> 02:04:02.430]
Don't mess with OJ.

[02:04:04.030 --> 02:04:06.390]
Republican rats start to desert sinking ship.

[02:04:07.450 --> 02:04:07.810]
O!

[02:04:08.830 --> 02:04:12.330]
The authority of the Bush administration is falling apart in its heartlands.

[02:04:12.330 --> 02:04:17.650]
Is this article by Michael Goenda on the age.com.

[02:04:18.170 --> 02:04:20.730]
With almost three years of George Bush's presidency to go,

[02:04:20.830 --> 02:04:24.530]
most Republicans in Congress have won political gold before the midterm congressional elections in November.

[02:04:24.890 --> 02:04:26.370]
They desert him as fast as they can.

[02:04:28.030 --> 02:04:30.570]
The discipline of the first Bush administration is gone.

[02:04:30.970 --> 02:04:33.470]
The Republican-dominated rubber stamp Congress is no more.

[02:04:33.850 --> 02:04:36.810]
Every day, another Republican-member Congress appears that Bush is a great guy,

[02:04:36.930 --> 02:04:38.990]
that they love him dearly, but then he's lost the plot.

[02:04:41.250 --> 02:04:42.310]
Sack people, they say.

[02:04:42.450 --> 02:04:43.150]
One day, it's Rumsfeld.

[02:04:43.270 --> 02:04:44.550]
The next day, they say it's Cheney.

[02:04:44.550 --> 02:04:46.210]
A day later, it's the whole White House staff.

[02:04:46.310 --> 02:04:47.710]
Do something Mr. President, they say.

[02:04:48.070 --> 02:04:50.870]
And by the way, they say, we love you dearly, but most of your policies stink.

[02:04:52.610 --> 02:04:54.090]
Come to think of it, it's all of them.

[02:04:54.150 --> 02:04:57.970]
From immigration where the Republican Bush wants to flood the country with illegal immigrants from Mexico,

[02:04:58.330 --> 02:04:59.810]
cheap labor for his buddies and big business,

[02:05:00.190 --> 02:05:03.910]
to the Medicare prescription drug plan for America's seniors that's out of control in terms of its cost,

[02:05:04.290 --> 02:05:08.650]
and which is so complicated that all of the Americans can be seen weeping at pharmacy counters across the country.

[02:05:08.990 --> 02:05:09.550]
Why did they meet?

[02:05:10.650 --> 02:05:14.490]
No opportunity by Republicans to criticize Bush with a heavy heart of course is missed.

[02:05:14.970 --> 02:05:18.710]
When commercial radio shock-jock suddenly discovered that the Bush administration had approved the takeover

[02:05:18.710 --> 02:05:21.330]
of six American forts by a Dubai company, by Arabs,

[02:05:21.830 --> 02:05:24.530]
the Republican leaders in Congress were in danger of crossing each other's injury,

[02:05:24.850 --> 02:05:29.150]
as they made the dashboard the TV cameras and microphones to say an essence that Bush had lost his marbles.

[02:05:30.610 --> 02:05:33.830]
Oh, meanwhile, in that awful movie, God send with Danero.

[02:05:34.970 --> 02:05:40.670]
He's got two big steel balls, about four times the size of the ones that Bogart was rolling around in Canine Mutiny,

[02:05:41.410 --> 02:05:42.690]
and he just keeps the rolling around.

[02:05:42.810 --> 02:05:43.770]
I still have no idea with them.

[02:05:43.890 --> 02:05:45.210]
And that's such a horrible movie.

[02:05:46.090 --> 02:05:47.610]
God send. You can see the light.

[02:05:47.910 --> 02:05:48.430]
Please don't.

[02:05:48.730 --> 02:05:49.410]
It's all part of it.

[02:05:49.930 --> 02:05:50.270]
Don't.

[02:05:51.490 --> 02:05:55.370]
The Democrats meanwhile are more or less all over the place on every issue,

[02:05:55.770 --> 02:05:57.630]
except the Arab takeover of these American forts,

[02:05:57.990 --> 02:06:00.110]
where their outrage was outrageous and frankly racist.

[02:06:00.110 --> 02:06:03.690]
The Congress of the World's sole superpower appears to be an undisciplined rabble.

[02:06:04.210 --> 02:06:06.370]
On the key issues that Americans are really worried about,

[02:06:06.470 --> 02:06:08.210]
and Iraq is overwhelming the most important one,

[02:06:08.550 --> 02:06:11.770]
neither Republicans, nor Democrats, and Congress have a clue as what to do.

[02:06:12.370 --> 02:06:13.310]
That's the part I agree with.

[02:06:13.710 --> 02:06:17.330]
Neither does Bush and increasing looks and sounds of things weighed down by the relentless bad news

[02:06:17.330 --> 02:06:21.090]
from Iraq and the daily crises and political missteps that have plagued the second term.

[02:06:21.550 --> 02:06:25.210]
It was in this political environment that the Republican Party's Southern Leadership Conference

[02:06:25.210 --> 02:06:26.290]
spent last week in Memphis.

[02:06:26.870 --> 02:06:31.370]
The highlight of the two-day conference was a straw poll of the 2000-server Republican Party activists

[02:06:31.370 --> 02:06:35.010]
and supporters of the leading candidates for the party's 2008 presidential nomination.

[02:06:35.510 --> 02:06:37.990]
One candidate who wasn't in Memphis, it was not part of the poll,

[02:06:38.110 --> 02:06:41.810]
but former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who in poll-active poll is far and away

[02:06:41.810 --> 02:06:45.390]
the people's stories that include Republicans for the party's nomination in 2008.

[02:06:46.190 --> 02:06:50.830]
Most political aimless seem to be, what Bernie Kerrick is going to be like an albatross around his neck.

[02:06:50.990 --> 02:06:53.670]
You know, if he gets it, they're going to bring his ass back

[02:06:53.670 --> 02:06:57.070]
in the whole thing about that apartment he had in the World Trade Center

[02:06:57.070 --> 02:07:02.150]
and all the dalliances that were going on there and all the phony baloney for any Kerrick.

[02:07:03.350 --> 02:07:05.750]
He's going to be the Monica Lewinsky for Rudy Giuliani.

[02:07:06.830 --> 02:07:07.970]
Even though they didn't do anything.

[02:07:09.650 --> 02:07:10.810]
940 votes on that poll.

[02:07:10.830 --> 02:07:12.930]
Boy, it's going to be a glorious moment when you get to a thousand.

[02:07:13.070 --> 02:07:14.930]
Josh can breathe easy. You know, he can get his full paycheck.

[02:07:16.590 --> 02:07:18.910]
Oh. Yeah, can you breathe easy now?

[02:07:19.310 --> 02:07:19.650]
I can't.

[02:07:21.230 --> 02:07:23.870]
Archbishop, this isn't a guardian, the Brit paper, the guardian.

[02:07:25.070 --> 02:07:27.190]
Stop teaching creationism, he says.

[02:07:28.110 --> 02:07:32.070]
The Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, has stepped into the controversy

[02:07:32.070 --> 02:07:35.250]
between religious fundamentalists and scientists by saying he doesn't believe

[02:07:35.250 --> 02:07:37.730]
that creationism, the Bible-based account of the origins of the world,

[02:07:37.970 --> 02:07:40.730]
should be taught in schools. And Archbishop happens to be...

[02:07:40.730 --> 02:07:42.270]
Absolutely correction.

[02:07:42.510 --> 02:07:44.570]
...and he is a really snappy dresser too. You ever see him?

[02:07:45.350 --> 02:07:45.450]
No.

[02:07:45.850 --> 02:07:46.610]
What a lovely gown.

[02:07:47.510 --> 02:07:50.270]
Giving his first wide-ranging interview at Lambeth Palace,

[02:07:50.470 --> 02:07:54.550]
the Archbishop was emphatic in his criticism of creationism being taught in the classroom

[02:07:54.550 --> 02:07:58.310]
as it's happening in two city academies funded by the Evangelical Christian businessman,

[02:07:58.670 --> 02:08:01.550]
Sir Peter Vardy in several other schools, oh, damn, silly-ass Brits.

[02:08:01.950 --> 02:08:02.590]
Give me the schmitz.

[02:08:03.690 --> 02:08:06.210]
I think creationism is a kind of category mistake,

[02:08:06.230 --> 02:08:11.090]
is if the Bible were a theory like other theories, if creationism is presented as a stark alternative theory

[02:08:11.090 --> 02:08:13.990]
along other theories, I think there's just been a jarring of categories.

[02:08:13.990 --> 02:08:17.730]
My worry is that creationism can end up producing the doctrine of creation rather than enhancing it.

[02:08:17.830 --> 02:08:22.750]
He said, no, we know that the Bible is not that. The Bible is just a bunch of ramblings of primitive dumb superstitions,

[02:08:22.950 --> 02:08:26.550]
idiotic ignorant people, over a period of long, long number of years,

[02:08:27.470 --> 02:08:28.810]
most of whom didn't even know each other.

[02:08:30.670 --> 02:08:32.670]
Even ASOP is embarrassed by the Bible.

[02:08:33.930 --> 02:08:36.750]
The debate over creationism or slightly more sophisticated offshoot,

[02:08:36.870 --> 02:08:40.670]
so-called intelligent design, ID, which I've used that creation is so complex

[02:08:40.670 --> 02:08:43.610]
that an intelligent religious force must have directed it,

[02:08:43.610 --> 02:08:48.030]
has provoked divisions in Britain, but nothing like the vehement or politicization of the debate in the USA.

[02:08:49.010 --> 02:08:51.070]
There, under the pressure from the religious right,

[02:08:51.290 --> 02:08:54.150]
some states are considering giving ID equal prominence to Darwinism,

[02:08:54.370 --> 02:08:57.210]
they generally scientifically accept the account of the evolution of the species.

[02:08:58.090 --> 02:09:02.710]
Most scientists believe that ID is older more than intent to smuggle fundamental Christianity into science,

[02:09:02.890 --> 02:09:04.270]
and of course that happens to be-

[02:09:04.270 --> 02:09:05.950]
I'm so moving, correct sir.

[02:09:05.950 --> 02:09:09.710]
The rest states from Ohio to California are considering placing ID on the curriculum

[02:09:09.710 --> 02:09:13.650]
with President Bush telling reporters last August that both sides ought to be properly taught,

[02:09:13.950 --> 02:09:15.570]
so people don't understand what the debate is about.

[02:09:16.150 --> 02:09:19.150]
I think that's a great idea. I think we ought to have somebody in every classroom

[02:09:19.150 --> 02:09:22.510]
telling our kids what a bunch of fairy tales the Bible is,

[02:09:23.250 --> 02:09:27.890]
and reading like those first couple of pages of Genesis and debunking it in about 10 seconds or less.

[02:09:27.950 --> 02:09:30.070]
Don't stop with science, you know, history, culture, and that kind of thing.

[02:09:30.070 --> 02:09:32.910]
Are you like to rule the day and the lesser like to rule the night,

[02:09:32.910 --> 02:09:35.290]
the sun and the cockamoon, that's what that's all about, okay?

[02:09:35.650 --> 02:09:38.530]
Primitive superstitious people wouldn't know their ass from your elbow,

[02:09:39.190 --> 02:09:41.070]
and here we are thousands of years later,

[02:09:41.350 --> 02:09:44.770]
and well the good book says, I mean it's just pathetic, makes you want to gag,

[02:09:45.210 --> 02:09:47.230]
makes you want to gag the God Squad,

[02:09:47.550 --> 02:09:48.670]
ever then sawdust.

[02:09:50.290 --> 02:09:52.570]
Man, staleer than last year's halava.

[02:09:54.850 --> 02:09:57.690]
As dull as the 75-year-old Gillette Blueblade.

[02:09:59.230 --> 02:10:01.550]
Let's go back into the razor blade thing, and I haven't heard that.

[02:10:01.550 --> 02:10:04.310]
Let's try that new file, what is it, the quintuplet, what do they call it?

[02:10:04.430 --> 02:10:06.170]
Yeah, interesting, the one with the battery in it.

[02:10:06.670 --> 02:10:09.050]
Oh, no, this is another one with a battery?

[02:10:09.970 --> 02:10:11.890]
If it's the one with the four blades and then the one in the back.

[02:10:12.470 --> 02:10:13.730]
No, no, they got five blades.

[02:10:14.450 --> 02:10:15.110]
I got it.

[02:10:15.470 --> 02:10:16.090]
You got it?

[02:10:16.250 --> 02:10:17.990]
I got the one with the battery, man.

[02:10:19.910 --> 02:10:21.450]
I wonder where he's using that.

[02:10:21.570 --> 02:10:21.870]
Welcome.

[02:10:23.670 --> 02:10:25.590]
Oh, you're practicing for Duff, huh?

[02:10:27.270 --> 02:10:31.510]
9.53 on a pole, 952 volt, we got the 40-year-seven minutes.

[02:10:32.090 --> 02:10:34.550]
So that's like one minute we'll get us exactly to a thousand.

[02:10:34.630 --> 02:10:35.970]
How do you like the way that turned out, huh?

[02:10:36.730 --> 02:10:39.690]
Without having to put undue pressure on this audience, we don't like to do that.

[02:10:41.630 --> 02:10:45.370]
113, the Gully Warmer show, we got that big panzer crap oil game that I had at the Macarine.

[02:10:45.370 --> 02:10:48.450]
There'd be at least 5,000 people for that one, it'll be a rollicking place.

[02:10:48.870 --> 02:10:53.430]
And then tomorrow and Saturday, two Toronto ad Montreal games, I'm sure you're all whipped up about that, aren't you?

[02:10:53.890 --> 02:10:54.290]
Oh yeah, whipped.

[02:10:55.330 --> 02:10:59.070]
This schedule this year is really, I mean, too bad as nobody can talk to about these things.

[02:10:59.090 --> 02:11:00.030]
Can't release TV.

[02:11:00.570 --> 02:11:03.350]
Welcome back to the program, Mike Brophy, senior writer for the Hockey News Transit.

[02:11:03.590 --> 02:11:06.770]
So, can you imagine in South Florida Panthers TV, a channel?

[02:11:07.250 --> 02:11:07.910]
Can you imagine that?

[02:11:08.710 --> 02:11:09.110]
No.

[02:11:09.610 --> 02:11:12.790]
Because I'm trying to tell you, hockey here is not like a sport, it's a sickness.

[02:11:14.150 --> 02:11:16.290]
Hey, beach forts being a sickness has gone mad.

[02:11:16.470 --> 02:11:19.630]
They're not even a fruit cake, it's madness and march all this month of beach fort.

[02:11:20.010 --> 02:11:22.370]
They just missed having their record month last month in February.

[02:11:22.370 --> 02:11:24.670]
So, they plan to break that record this month right now.

[02:11:24.830 --> 02:11:32.390]
And right now, extend the CAD-4F-150s, there was always $249 a month with 9.95 down plus fees with a fruit credit in the 39 month lease.

[02:11:33.090 --> 02:11:40.730]
Madness and march of beach forts mean you must be mad not to take advantage of rebates and discounts up to 10 grand on all new and used vehicles.

[02:11:41.290 --> 02:11:49.290]
If you're not in the market for new carbon, no somebody was, send them into beach fort because if they take delivery this month, during the month of March, beach fort will send you 200 bucks just for sending them in.

[02:11:49.290 --> 02:11:50.990]
That money comes from the advertising budget.

[02:11:51.070 --> 02:11:54.150]
They will absolutely not affect your friends price, they won't tack it on.

[02:11:54.510 --> 02:12:05.290]
So, I'm excitedness once you have had beach forts madness and march, extended CAD-4F-150s as low as $249 a month, discounts and rebates up to 10 grand and $200 in cash just for referring your friend.

[02:12:05.630 --> 02:12:11.530]
Haryana and beach fort is located two miles east of the Golden Graves interchange on 163rd Street, West Dixie Highway, guaranteed.

[02:12:11.790 --> 02:12:15.170]
I'll bet you everybody in the world's life on it, you will love your beach fort experience.

[02:12:15.170 --> 02:12:21.570]
This is Neil Rogers. This is 5.62 AF.

[02:12:22.170 --> 02:12:22.170]

[02:12:24.170 --> 02:12:28.070]
Log on to www.wam.com for Bell South Food Scissorion.

[02:12:29.010 --> 02:12:37.010]
Move your pixie fort to start each game for your chance to win a grand prize of $1,000 from Bell South at 5.62 AF.

[02:12:37.290 --> 02:12:38.050]
I drop my winner.

[02:12:38.150 --> 02:12:39.530]
Or congratulations, get alive.

[02:12:46.390 --> 02:12:47.750]
For sure they win.

[02:12:48.990 --> 02:12:50.170]
You watch it, you watch it.

[02:12:50.790 --> 02:12:53.110]
Come on, come on, come on.

[02:12:56.190 --> 02:12:58.830]
Another ever-debted, Mr. Ferry.

[02:13:05.990 --> 02:13:08.010]
Who might get hit at that guy?

[02:13:09.230 --> 02:13:11.230]
What the hell did we do?

[02:13:11.230 --> 02:13:15.010]
Do you think this is why are we out of hanging?

[02:13:16.870 --> 02:13:20.230]
I do for sure who will choose a boolean.

[02:13:29.490 --> 02:13:32.270]
I don't care who you are, you're fair.

[02:13:33.270 --> 02:13:34.770]
Here's your lesson, dear.

[02:13:36.110 --> 02:13:38.350]
Through a home to a wedding.

[02:13:40.070 --> 02:13:41.210]
Stop with your friends.

[02:13:41.210 --> 02:13:41.210]

[02:14:03.170 --> 02:14:05.370]
I'm not a bad man.

[02:14:08.230 --> 02:14:11.190]
I'm not a bad man.

[02:14:11.190 --> 02:14:11.190]

[02:14:11.190 --> 02:14:11.190]

[02:14:11.190 --> 02:14:11.190]

[02:14:11.190 --> 02:14:11.190]

[02:14:11.190 --> 02:14:11.190]

[02:14:11.190 --> 02:14:11.190]

[02:14:11.190 --> 02:14:11.190]

[02:14:11.190 --> 02:14:11.190]

[02:14:11.190 --> 02:14:11.190]

[02:14:11.190 --> 02:14:11.190]

[02:14:11.190 --> 02:14:11.190]

[02:14:11.190 --> 02:14:11.190]

[02:14:11.190 --> 02:14:11.190]

[02:14:18.250 --> 02:14:19.490]
I'm not a bad man.

[02:14:19.490 --> 02:14:19.490]

[02:14:19.490 --> 02:14:19.490]

[02:14:19.490 --> 02:14:19.490]

[02:14:19.490 --> 02:14:19.490]

[02:14:19.490 --> 02:14:20.650]
I'm not a bad man.

[02:14:20.770 --> 02:14:21.510]
I'm not a bad man.

[02:14:21.870 --> 02:14:26.430]
I'm not a bad man.

[02:14:27.950 --> 02:14:29.750]
I'm not a bad man.

[02:14:30.670 --> 02:14:32.170]
I'm not a bad man.

[02:14:33.030 --> 02:14:34.450]
I'm not a bad man.

[02:14:39.870 --> 02:14:41.030]
I'm not a bad man.

[02:14:41.030 --> 02:14:42.670]
North Korea suggested yesterday a

[02:14:42.670 --> 02:14:44.750]
Hendi Ability to launch a preemptive attack on the

[02:14:44.750 --> 02:14:46.690]
U.S. According to the North's official news agency.

[02:14:47.030 --> 02:14:48.370]
And as a picture of Kim Jong-il,

[02:14:48.850 --> 02:14:50.590]
who looked at the hell of a lot better in Team America.

[02:14:52.010 --> 02:14:53.910]
That is why he was still alive in that thing.

[02:14:54.990 --> 02:14:56.810]
A four-minute story spokesman said the North had built

[02:14:56.810 --> 02:14:58.830]
atomic weapons to counter the U.S. nuclear threat.

[02:14:59.290 --> 02:15:01.050]
As we declared our strong revolutionary might

[02:15:01.050 --> 02:15:03.310]
put in place all mentioned to counter-possible U.S.

[02:15:03.450 --> 02:15:05.770]
preemptive strike, the spokesman said according to the Korean

[02:15:05.770 --> 02:15:06.750]
Central News Agency,

[02:15:07.130 --> 02:15:09.170]
preemptive strike is not the monopoly of the U.S.A.

[02:15:10.210 --> 02:15:12.350]
The United States urged North Korea to return to the

[02:15:12.350 --> 02:15:14.210]
international nuclear negotiations instead of making

[02:15:14.210 --> 02:15:15.210]
a fan-tory statement.

[02:15:16.170 --> 02:15:17.150]
Oh, in other words,

[02:15:17.370 --> 02:15:18.710]
Bush could make a fan-tory statement,

[02:15:18.710 --> 02:15:21.850]
like that new policy about the preemptive strikes on

[02:15:21.850 --> 02:15:23.750]
any of the way we feel like given how he feels in the

[02:15:23.750 --> 02:15:24.010]
morning.

[02:15:24.490 --> 02:15:25.290]
But other than that,

[02:15:25.770 --> 02:15:27.910]
State Department spokesman Sean McCormick said the U.S.

[02:15:28.010 --> 02:15:29.930]
is no offensive invade or attack North Korea.

[02:15:31.350 --> 02:15:33.570]
Yet, last week the Communist company warned that it had

[02:15:33.570 --> 02:15:35.210]
to launch a preemptive strike, saying with

[02:15:35.210 --> 02:15:37.390]
strength and its world footing, before joined South Korea,

[02:15:37.390 --> 02:15:39.810]
U.S. military exercises scheduled for this weekend.

[02:15:41.810 --> 02:15:42.390]
Thank you,

[02:15:42.430 --> 02:15:44.710]
that we don't support any regime that like, you know,

[02:15:45.010 --> 02:15:45.870]
rogue regimes,

[02:15:47.210 --> 02:15:48.050]
right, dictatorships,

[02:15:48.130 --> 02:15:49.450]
right, that supply our own,

[02:15:49.630 --> 02:15:50.770]
weapons, all of our countries,

[02:15:50.770 --> 02:15:53.070]
not all these things, nuclear technology to our countries

[02:15:53.070 --> 02:15:53.730]
like North Korea.

[02:15:54.350 --> 02:15:54.950]
That would be bad.

[02:15:55.470 --> 02:15:57.730]
So, it's being a bad seven months after Katrina,

[02:15:58.470 --> 02:16:01.290]
the New York Times spoke to 137 evacuaries and found

[02:16:01.290 --> 02:16:04.350]
that a majority had depleted their savings and believed

[02:16:04.350 --> 02:16:06.210]
that the rest of the nation in politicianhood Washington

[02:16:06.210 --> 02:16:07.030]
had moved on.

[02:16:07.350 --> 02:16:08.290]
It's a lengthy story.

[02:16:08.370 --> 02:16:08.970]
It's on our website.

[02:16:09.110 --> 02:16:09.910]
I'm sure it is, Josh.

[02:16:10.410 --> 02:16:11.090]
Yes, it is.

[02:16:11.730 --> 02:16:12.570]
And it's from a raw story.

[02:16:12.690 --> 02:16:14.450]
Raw story is one of the best websites.

[02:16:14.790 --> 02:16:17.130]
Yeah, they've changed their format, right?

[02:16:18.310 --> 02:16:20.090]
And the new format is just awesome.

[02:16:20.230 --> 02:16:20.650]
It's excellent.

[02:16:21.110 --> 02:16:23.270]
I put it right up there with smirking, a smircling chimp

[02:16:23.270 --> 02:16:24.810]
and common dreams and some of the other ones.

[02:16:24.910 --> 02:16:25.170]
Very good.

[02:16:25.950 --> 02:16:28.210]
The interview suggested that while blacks and whites suffered

[02:16:28.210 --> 02:16:30.750]
similar rates of emotional trauma, blacks for a heavier

[02:16:30.750 --> 02:16:32.430]
economic and social burden, no kidding.

[02:16:33.050 --> 02:16:34.390]
And even as both groups slounder,

[02:16:34.390 --> 02:16:36.050]
most said they believed that the rest of the nation

[02:16:36.050 --> 02:16:38.410]
and politicians in Washington have moved on.

[02:16:38.810 --> 02:16:40.730]
I don't think anybody cares really if said Robert Rodriguez,

[02:16:41.050 --> 02:16:42.470]
a semi-retired computer programmer,

[02:16:42.750 --> 02:16:44.610]
was returned to his home in the separate room of Terry.

[02:16:45.550 --> 02:16:46.630]
Is that Metare or material?

[02:16:46.810 --> 02:16:47.490]
I don't know how you say that.

[02:16:47.890 --> 02:16:48.050]
Earth.

[02:16:48.490 --> 02:16:49.090]
I hate New Orleans.

[02:16:49.490 --> 02:16:50.670]
New Orleans is kind of like a divide

[02:16:50.670 --> 02:16:51.990]
in the country that you just forget about us.

[02:16:52.130 --> 02:16:53.390]
That's right, like a divide in the bowl.

[02:16:54.150 --> 02:16:55.650]
Like a turret at the bottom of the bowl.

[02:16:56.210 --> 02:16:57.130]
Now, how you see New Orleans?

[02:16:57.350 --> 02:16:58.830]
I mean, I don't want to start this respectful life.

[02:16:58.930 --> 02:17:00.130]
You're all the tourists they have from Katrina.

[02:17:00.550 --> 02:17:02.430]
But it's long before Katrina, I always told you that,

[02:17:02.530 --> 02:17:03.610]
and I'm not going to change my opinion.

[02:17:03.610 --> 02:17:04.470]
I've never been there before.

[02:17:04.750 --> 02:17:04.970]
I don't know.

[02:17:05.250 --> 02:17:06.790]
Well, don't.

[02:17:06.830 --> 02:17:09.150]
Well, I like a drug and degenerate.

[02:17:09.150 --> 02:17:09.590]
It's a drug.

[02:17:10.010 --> 02:17:11.650]
Stumbling around in the street, flying in a building.

[02:17:11.770 --> 02:17:12.950]
Yeah, it's just a, I don't know.

[02:17:13.450 --> 02:17:14.750]
It's just a whole ambiance of it.

[02:17:14.970 --> 02:17:17.130]
You can go to Key West with suds, okay?

[02:17:17.350 --> 02:17:19.010]
Or with Duff, go to fantasy fast.

[02:17:19.150 --> 02:17:19.770]
They'll take you long.

[02:17:20.170 --> 02:17:20.350]
Oh, good.

[02:17:21.390 --> 02:17:23.130]
They'll put you on a shoulder like a papuce.

[02:17:24.470 --> 02:17:27.370]
Oh, speaking of babies, this is great from the Toronto Star.

[02:17:27.810 --> 02:17:30.690]
How does thought a baby conservative, okay?

[02:17:32.250 --> 02:17:34.530]
Remember the whiny, insecure kid in nursery school,

[02:17:34.610 --> 02:17:36.350]
the one who always thought everybody was out to get him

[02:17:36.350 --> 02:17:37.890]
and was always running to the teacher with complaints?

[02:17:38.270 --> 02:17:39.990]
Chances are he grew up to be a conservative.

[02:17:41.410 --> 02:17:42.070]
At least he did it.

[02:17:42.110 --> 02:17:44.170]
He was one of 95 kids from the Berkeley area

[02:17:44.170 --> 02:17:46.810]
that social scientists have been tracking for the last 20 years.

[02:17:47.350 --> 02:17:50.230]
The confident, resilient, suffer-lying kids mostly grew up to be liberals.

[02:17:51.270 --> 02:17:53.370]
The study from the urinal of research into personnel,

[02:17:53.370 --> 02:17:55.010]
they isn't going to make the UC Berkeley professor

[02:17:55.010 --> 02:17:56.510]
who published it any friends on the right.

[02:17:57.010 --> 02:17:58.950]
Similar to conclusion a few years ago from another academic,

[02:17:58.950 --> 02:18:01.150]
so I'm excoriated on right wing blogs,

[02:18:01.570 --> 02:18:03.950]
even led to making racial investigation into his research funding.

[02:18:04.630 --> 02:18:07.790]
But the results of the new results are worth a look.

[02:18:08.590 --> 02:18:12.450]
In the 1960s, Jack Block and his wife and fellow professor Jean Block

[02:18:12.450 --> 02:18:15.390]
now deceased began tracking more than 100 nursery school kids

[02:18:15.390 --> 02:18:17.270]
as part of a general study of personality.

[02:18:18.030 --> 02:18:19.930]
The kids' personalities were rated at the time

[02:18:19.930 --> 02:18:22.690]
by teachers and assistants who had known them for months.

[02:18:23.210 --> 02:18:25.430]
There's no reason to think political bias skewed the ratings.

[02:18:25.770 --> 02:18:28.290]
The investigators weren't looking at political orientation back then.

[02:18:28.290 --> 02:18:29.270]
Even if they had been,

[02:18:29.530 --> 02:18:30.870]
it's unlikely that three and four year olds

[02:18:30.870 --> 02:18:32.890]
would have had much idea about their political leanings.

[02:18:33.610 --> 02:18:36.110]
A few decades later, Block followed up with more surveys

[02:18:36.110 --> 02:18:38.590]
looking at personality at this time in politics too.

[02:18:38.950 --> 02:18:41.950]
The whiny kids tended to grow up conservative, the whiny kids.

[02:18:42.990 --> 02:18:44.030]
Like Robert Creeper.

[02:18:45.490 --> 02:18:47.030]
And turned into rigid young adults

[02:18:47.030 --> 02:18:49.070]
so he would closely to traditional gender rules

[02:18:49.070 --> 02:18:51.830]
and were uncomfortable with ambiguity, like Robert Creeper.

[02:18:51.870 --> 02:18:53.890]
I don't care who you are, you fairy.

[02:18:54.190 --> 02:18:55.490]
The competent kids, you're not liberal.

[02:18:55.490 --> 02:18:56.890]
And we're still hanging loose.

[02:18:57.290 --> 02:18:59.690]
Turnings, oh, see, there's something missing here.

[02:18:59.790 --> 02:19:00.150]
Oh, no.

[02:19:00.690 --> 02:19:01.390]
Isn't that bad?

[02:19:01.490 --> 02:19:01.990]
Turning Japanese.

[02:19:02.770 --> 02:19:03.570]
Turning Japanese.

[02:19:04.690 --> 02:19:06.630]
Similar work by John T. Yost,

[02:19:06.630 --> 02:19:09.690]
the Stanford and colleagues in 2003 duet political backlash.

[02:19:10.410 --> 02:19:12.490]
The researchers reviewed 44 years worth of studies

[02:19:12.490 --> 02:19:13.970]
in the psychology of conservatism

[02:19:13.970 --> 02:19:15.770]
and concluded that people were dogmatic,

[02:19:15.990 --> 02:19:17.810]
fearful, intolerant of ambiguity, uncertainty,

[02:19:18.210 --> 02:19:20.630]
and who crave order and structure are more likely to gravitate

[02:19:20.630 --> 02:19:21.430]
to conservatism.

[02:19:22.090 --> 02:19:24.870]
Critics branded it the conservatism is our crazy study

[02:19:24.870 --> 02:19:26.630]
and accused the authors of political bias.

[02:19:27.270 --> 02:19:29.630]
Well, what's wrong with that conservatism is our crazy study, huh?

[02:19:29.910 --> 02:19:32.190]
Let's better let conservatism is a stupid study that we just did.

[02:19:32.910 --> 02:19:34.770]
Yost, welcome to the new study, say it lends support

[02:19:34.770 --> 02:19:36.830]
to his conclusions, but Jeff Greenberg,

[02:19:36.830 --> 02:19:39.570]
a social psychologist at the University of Arizona

[02:19:39.570 --> 02:19:41.350]
who was critical of Yost, he was less impressed.

[02:19:41.730 --> 02:19:42.610]
Well, what do you expect Arizona?

[02:19:44.330 --> 02:19:46.470]
Home of just about every right wing nut group

[02:19:46.470 --> 02:19:48.190]
on the face of the earth.

[02:19:48.870 --> 02:19:51.070]
I found it to be biased, shotty work,

[02:19:51.270 --> 02:19:53.010]
poor science and best, he said in a block study.

[02:19:53.010 --> 02:19:56.010]
He thinks insecure defensive rigid people can easily gravitate

[02:19:56.010 --> 02:19:57.670]
to left wing ideologies as right wing one,

[02:19:57.790 --> 02:19:59.450]
says this, uh, Jeff Greenberg,

[02:19:59.670 --> 02:20:02.070]
of a self-hating Jewel like Robert Creeper, no doubt.

[02:20:02.430 --> 02:20:03.830]
He suspects that in common is China,

[02:20:04.190 --> 02:20:06.370]
those kinds of people are likely to become fervid party members.

[02:20:07.470 --> 02:20:08.370]
See, commonista.

[02:20:09.430 --> 02:20:10.950]
The results do raise some obvious questions.

[02:20:11.110 --> 02:20:12.930]
Our nursery school teachers in the conservative heartland

[02:20:12.930 --> 02:20:15.930]
cursed with classes filled with little proto-conservative whiners,

[02:20:16.330 --> 02:20:19.330]
or does an insecure little boy raise an Idaho or Alberta surrounded

[02:20:19.330 --> 02:20:21.430]
by conservatives turned instead to liberalism?

[02:20:22.250 --> 02:20:23.870]
Or did the whiny kids grow up conservative

[02:20:23.870 --> 02:20:25.630]
along with the majority of their more confident peers,

[02:20:25.910 --> 02:20:29.130]
while one of the kids with poor impulse control turned out to be liberal?

[02:20:29.830 --> 02:20:31.430]
The grown up liberal men on the other hand,

[02:20:31.510 --> 02:20:33.870]
with their introspection and recognition of complexity in the world,

[02:20:33.890 --> 02:20:36.390]
could be seen as self-indulgent and ineffectual.

[02:20:37.210 --> 02:20:39.490]
I'll agree with the self-indulgent much, strong with that.

[02:20:40.710 --> 02:20:42.210]
Whether anyone's feelings are heard or not,

[02:20:42.370 --> 02:20:44.810]
they work suggest that personality and emotions play a bigger role

[02:20:44.810 --> 02:20:46.090]
in our political leanings than we think.

[02:20:46.470 --> 02:20:47.990]
All of us liberal consider it a field

[02:20:47.990 --> 02:20:49.450]
as though we've reached our political opinions

[02:20:49.450 --> 02:20:52.330]
by carefully weighing the evidence and exercising our best judgment.

[02:20:52.710 --> 02:20:55.250]
But it could be that all that careful reasoning is just after the fact,

[02:20:55.530 --> 02:20:56.490]
self-destification.

[02:20:57.250 --> 02:20:59.210]
What if personality forms our political outlook,

[02:20:59.510 --> 02:21:03.410]
with reason coming along behind rationalizing after the fact?

[02:21:04.110 --> 02:21:06.250]
It could be that whom we vote for as less than with our judgments

[02:21:06.250 --> 02:21:08.210]
about tax policy or free-trader health care,

[02:21:08.490 --> 02:21:11.290]
and moreover, the first nowadays we've been stuck with since we were little kids.

[02:21:11.630 --> 02:21:12.430]
How do you like that, huh?

[02:21:13.650 --> 02:21:16.430]
You're a little panty-waste whiners.

[02:21:17.130 --> 02:21:17.870]
Whatever the hell you are.

[02:21:17.870 --> 02:21:20.890]
No, exactly.

[02:21:21.470 --> 02:21:22.690]
Like I said before.

[02:21:22.890 --> 02:21:24.790]
I don't care who you are, you're fairly.

[02:21:25.250 --> 02:21:27.270]
This is Neil Rogers.

[02:21:28.110 --> 02:21:31.190]
This is 5'16", 2A.

[02:21:33.010 --> 02:21:33.710]
Absolutely.

[02:21:37.950 --> 02:21:40.430]
That's what the strip-point fat-red dough.

[02:21:40.770 --> 02:21:41.030]
Oh!

[02:21:42.950 --> 02:21:45.210]
$1.00 in the garden of the chat room.

[02:21:45.210 --> 02:21:46.770]
We can do that.

[02:21:48.190 --> 02:21:51.450]
He said honey, my son, it won't do you.

[02:21:52.830 --> 02:21:55.950]
But when you take him back, you do the private food.

[02:21:57.650 --> 02:21:59.090]
Where the hell do you go?

[02:22:01.430 --> 02:22:03.290]
What are you going to do about it?

[02:22:03.550 --> 02:22:04.830]
You fat ass.

[02:22:04.830 --> 02:22:06.070]
That's that dough.

[02:22:11.450 --> 02:22:13.730]
Take your clothes off your uses.

[02:22:16.050 --> 02:22:18.810]
Or the whole thing is down that I can do the things.

[02:22:21.550 --> 02:22:24.010]
Take me up a take roll of this fat.

[02:22:26.470 --> 02:22:29.230]
You don't leave out the metal with your tail or your thighs.

[02:22:30.970 --> 02:22:35.990]
Take me up a take roll.

[02:22:36.010 --> 02:22:39.550]
Take me up a take roll.

[02:22:44.450 --> 02:22:47.070]
You're just a handle moving fat guy.

[02:22:49.150 --> 02:22:52.330]
She know how to make her bold and dry.

[02:22:54.450 --> 02:22:57.290]
Like the chase you shower in the mountains.

[02:22:57.290 --> 02:23:01.390]
The moment you throw in a diamond,

[02:23:27.270 --> 02:23:27.270]

[02:23:27.270 --> 02:23:31.130]
fat boy does like he's doing me a favor you know I mean did you read it the way

[02:23:31.130 --> 02:23:35.630]
it's a preface there no I oh look at this I'll give you a new piece of copy and I

[02:25:16.670 --> 02:25:21.110]
me the Saudi government warns store owners yesterday that they have two

[02:25:21.110 --> 02:25:24.850]
months to comply with a decree banning men from selling lingerie and other

[02:25:24.850 --> 02:25:28.950]
women's apparel or face punishment like off of your head off of your arm off

[02:25:28.950 --> 02:25:33.190]
of your you know that too and as published in several Saudi papers the

[02:25:33.190 --> 02:25:37.070]
Ministry of Labor called an all women's clothing shop owners to comply with

[02:25:37.070 --> 02:25:40.050]
the decree issued two years ago in order to increase employment opportunities

[02:25:40.050 --> 02:25:44.830]
for Saudi women penalties and fines will be levied against store owners and

[02:25:44.830 --> 02:25:48.310]
male clerks who violate the ban said a statement by the Ministry adding a

[02:25:48.310 --> 02:25:53.090]
loan to affect June 19th the decree also says that store selling lingerie must

[02:25:53.090 --> 02:25:56.210]
conceal that section from the rest of the shop and compliance with the

[02:25:56.210 --> 02:26:00.330]
ultra conservative kingdom strict segregation of the sexes see this is

[02:26:00.330 --> 02:26:05.170]
democracy on a march in Saudi Arabia not a number of Saudi women had

[02:26:05.170 --> 02:26:07.890]
expressed this quiet having to buy their underwear for men Saudi papers

[02:26:07.890 --> 02:26:11.410]
reported and a meeting on Monday Saudi business owners treated with the

[02:26:11.410 --> 02:26:15.510]
P. Labor Minister something rather all who made to delay enforcing the ban to

[02:26:15.510 --> 02:26:19.210]
give them a chance to train women to work in stores in Saudi Arabia where

but this time carefully screened audience at the Cleveland City Club was

[02:37:35.630 --> 02:37:40.130]
buying it we're buying it perhaps most on target was an elderly gentleman

[02:37:40.130 --> 02:37:43.710]
who said what he said were three main reasons for going to war in Iraq WMD

[02:37:43.710 --> 02:37:48.410]
Iraq's ties to the 9-11 terrorists and the alleged purchase of nuclear material

[02:37:48.410 --> 02:37:51.810]
from knee-jerk and then noted right to the all three of these rationales are

[02:37:51.810 --> 02:37:55.910]
not to be false how do we restore confidence that Americans may have in their

[02:37:55.910 --> 02:37:58.510]
leaders and to be sure that the information that they're not getting is

[02:37:58.510 --> 02:38:03.090]

World Trade Center twin towers in Pentagon it is his way of announcing the firm

[02:38:26.330 --> 02:38:29.690]

insisting that the central front on the war on Iraqi on terror is Iraq it is

[02:38:38.330 --> 02:38:43.010]
now I guess meanwhile that old central front woolly Afghanistan is now also

[02:38:43.010 --> 02:38:46.790]
a push reassures 25 million people are not free and Afghanistan is no longer

[02:38:46.790 --> 02:38:49.810]
a safe haven for the terrorists he said apparently the president missed the

[02:38:49.810 --> 02:38:53.630]
director of the US defense intelligence agency general Michael Naples giving

[02:38:53.630 --> 02:38:57.010]
testimony to Congress a few weeks ago that Taliban resurgence not presents a

[02:38:57.010 --> 02:38:59.670]
greater threat to the Afghan central government's expansion of authority than

[02:38:59.670 --> 02:39:06.110]
any point since late 2001 the Taliban can I thought they were all gone they are

[02:39:06.110 --> 02:39:09.890]
occupied Iraq is useful to al-Qaeda and it still has a recruiting poster and

[02:39:09.890 --> 02:39:12.550]
this and myriad other ways the West military is continued heavy-handed

[02:39:12.550 --> 02:39:15.630]
presence in Iraq strengthens the hands of extremists and demagogues who can

[02:39:15.630 --> 02:39:19.090]
appeal to late and Iraqi nationalism and Muslim pride if we seem to have

[02:39:19.090 --> 02:39:22.230]
forgotten the terrorists don't need Iraq as a safe haven for terrorists to

[02:39:22.230 --> 02:39:25.310]
plot new attacks against our nation is bush-putted they're just as likely to be

[02:39:25.310 --> 02:39:28.350]
drawn from countries that are normally our allies just such as the 15

[02:39:28.350 --> 02:39:31.470]
hijackers recruited under the nose of the bush families chic friends in Saudi

[02:39:31.470 --> 02:39:38.230]
Arabia shake your booty finally for old times sake bush-tried it out is now

[02:39:38.230 --> 02:39:42.230]
hurry excuses for those missing Iraqi WMD he so trumped up to get a site for a

[02:39:42.230 --> 02:39:45.570]
preemptive war three years ago again blaming the deception on everyone except

[02:39:45.570 --> 02:39:49.290]
himself like you I asked that very same question where did we go wrong in

[02:39:49.290 --> 02:39:52.170]
intelligence he plaintively responded to his questioner the truth of the matter

[02:39:52.170 --> 02:39:54.930]
is that the whole world thought that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction

[02:39:55.390 --> 02:39:58.050]
not so most of the world thought it best to wait for the women's

[02:39:58.050 --> 02:40:02.290]
specters that on the ground in Iraq to complete their work before answering that

[02:40:02.290 --> 02:40:06.630]
question those inspectors have filed no such evidence to WMD and this present new

[02:40:06.630 --> 02:40:09.250]
full well that would be likely their final conclusion when he ordered the

[02:40:09.250 --> 02:40:12.510]
preemptive invasion yet he justified it by referring to the 9-11 attack

[02:40:12.510 --> 02:40:15.990]
warning we cannot wait for the final proof the smoking gun that could come in

[02:40:15.990 --> 02:40:20.950]
the form of a mushroom cloud on Tuesday the AP reported about a treasure trove

[02:40:20.950 --> 02:40:23.570]
of translations of audio tapes that topple over Iraqi meetings of

[02:40:23.570 --> 02:40:27.110]
Bobby Hussein released a request the US representative Peter Hoxtra the

[02:40:27.110 --> 02:40:29.590]
Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee show that Iraq

[02:40:29.590 --> 02:40:34.210]
destroyed its WMD program by 92 those tapes were obtained soon after the

[02:40:34.210 --> 02:40:37.810]
2003 invasion yet the Bush administration kept them secret while continuing

[02:40:37.810 --> 02:40:42.650]
to assert that Iraq had an active WMD program as opposed to ordinary people in

[02:40:42.650 --> 02:40:45.330]
this country and the world Bush has access to the same detailed information

[02:40:45.330 --> 02:40:48.850]
that the 9-11 commission used to conclude that the terrorist acts of 9-11 and

[02:40:48.850 --> 02:40:53.070]
others conducted by al-Tada Bore no relation to Iraq it's hardly an ad for

[02:40:53.070 --> 02:40:55.650]
American democracy that he's been able to operate before the war and is

[02:40:55.650 --> 02:40:58.750]
recently is this week as if the truth will never be allowed to hold him accountable

[02:40:58.750 --> 02:41:03.030]
though not in Cleveland which is something that's here about this is the new

[02:41:04.090 --> 02:41:08.130]
ruggers this is by 16 to a watchdog
