[00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:02.500]
Good morning.

[00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:03.540]
Oh, yeah.

[00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.080]
Well, you were right pardoned upon about the election up there.

[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.880]
What does that mean?

[00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:10.700]
Right.

[00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.540]
Yeah, far right.

[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:12.880]
Yeah.

[00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.100]
They didn't win by much.

[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.280]
But you said they would win.

[00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.520]
Well, I mean, the polls, when the polls all show their ten points ahead, they didn't even win by that much.

[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:21.900]
Yeah.

[00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.340]
We got our own issues to deal with the WQAM.

[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.200]
We got a program director who thinks he works at WVUM.

[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.220]
Your boy, your protege.

[00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:33.300]
U.M. stuff?

[00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.460]
Well, he's off to do basketball again, you know?

[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.160]
Oh, yeah.

[00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.080]
After losing my talent sheet that I faked twice, so I didn't not going to get to you.

[00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.120]
You know, every payday for me, I don't know about anybody else that works for beastly broadcasting, VBGI.

[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.860]
But every payday is an adventure.

[00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.080]
You can't find your life around it or make investments or do anything because God only owes if you're going to get paid on payday.

[00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.900]
I'm tired of it.

[00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.700]
I have spilkeys every 10th and the 25th of the month.

[00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.620]
This is about the 30th time.

[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.620]
About 30, man.

[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.020]
If they pulled this crap on me now.

[00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.700]
Would you get paid differently from everybody else in terms of the way it's structured?

[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.860]
Let me ask you.

[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.800]
Do you have talent fees?

[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.140]
I mean, only you have live spots.

[00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.160]
You do like the rest of us.

[00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.360]
Yeah.

[00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.380]
When you get those on the 25th of each month?

[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.680]
Yeah.

[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.160]
Well, that's when everybody gets them.

[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.660]
Same with me.

[00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.700]
There's nothing any different there.

[00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.400]
The difference with me is that, you know, they have, I'm on the installment plan.

[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.700]
Whenever they get around to it.

[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.200]
Underlines the stall.

[00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.000]
Underlines the stall.

[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]
You know, how installment is felt?

[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.020]
Underlines the stall part.

[00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.520]
Yeah.

[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.220]
And our program director is too busy playing the amateur.

[00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.560]
See, I don't know about you.

[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.320]
But once upon a time when we had Duff there and we had with clearance like his is underling under his armpit.

[00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.720]
Or maybe he was hiding in his dome.

[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.820]
Right.

[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.800]
Don't worry, hung out.

[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.980]
But, you know, something like that would happen.

[00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.840]
You go to him and he would always take care of it.

[00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.280]
But now that Duff has been demoted and believe me, they demoted the wrong guy.

[00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.820]
They made a bad mistake.

[00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.320]
And now Duff is a sales hole, which is the way of saying, hey, guess what?

[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.040]
You're twice he got screwed over.

[00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.040]
You know, it's really something when they make somebody you're assistant.

[00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.420]
And all of a sudden the assistant's like, look it over your shoulder.

[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.280]
And get ready to like move into your desk, you know, stuff like that.

[00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.920]
And then all of a sudden, like, 60% of your salary disappears.

[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.060]
And you become like a glorified the paper pusher and have no authority.

[00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.780]
And the next thing, you know, you're a salesman.

[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.300]
Well, I think there's a message in there, you know?

[00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.720]
So when his big consolidation took place in December, where they blew away,

[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.080]
Perry out the door and they blew Duff out of that side of the building over to sales,

[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.760]
they made the wrong move there.

[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.520]
But then again, why would they talk to any of us?

[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.020]
What do we know?

[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.920]
So that's the one thing about the good people in this business they talk to the talent, like Dick Casper.

[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.280]
Remember we talked about him a couple weeks ago?

[00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.540]
Yep.

[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.660]
I go to lunch with him.

[00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.080]
We brainstorm, come up with ideas, all sorts of things.

[00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.120]
He was anxious to hear what you had to say.

[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.080]
Joe Bell is.

[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.760]
Well, that may be, but he's inheriting a situation that I don't know.

[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.220]
I don't think he's aware of yet.

[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.000]
He'll find out.

[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.560]
Well, you know, something he may find out, but I already know that this has happened just too many times, you know?

[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.520]
And I get off the yesterday at two o'clock, life goes on.

[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.800]
I'm sitting there in no as a matter of fact, I went to lunch at two o'clock.

[00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:56.960]
I come back at three o'clock.

[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.320]
And here's a frankly message from our sometimes part-time program director who's off to play.

[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.520]
You and basketball, you know, a list of whatever he said as I know his games to disappear for two or three days.

[00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.220]
What was the problem with your talent?

[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.920]
Well, she didn't show up and you're checked, but it means that I'm up and your regular check will be there on Wednesday,

[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.180]
but your talent won't.

[00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.240]
And here's a facet to accounting and that's it.

[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.320]
And he's getting on a plane.

[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.140]
So I come in there looking at schedule.

[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.640]
Sure he's getting on a plane because the hurricane basketball is at Virginia today.

[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.460]
So that's what he's going to be doing.

[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.400]
So hopefully he's at Virginia.

[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.860]
He'll make you lots of Thomas.

[00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.660]
Yeah, your market radio stations can't afford part-time program directors.

[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.520]
Okay, and I told him I was kind of ironic because I told him on Friday.

[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.280]
He came in there for, remember on Friday, I told him he came in for 35 minutes and hassled me for like a book.

[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.400]
I might have eaten, but I didn't even know where my log was.

[00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.080]
I was totally unprepared to go on a year because he bugged me for 35 minutes.

[00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.620]
And I said, you know, you really ought to make up your mind whether you want to be the program director or a sports nerd.

[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.540]
If you want to be a sports nerd, go over to VOM with Mike Rosenthal and Jay Rokich, you know,

[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.580]
and be a baby the rest of your life or even be a program director.

[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.500]
And the last thing I talked to him yesterday when he came in there,

[00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.700]
and George was outside yesterday, so we had our own issues in the studio.

[00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.800]
And he comes in in the middle of it and I said to him, I said, Wednesday is payday, okay?

[00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.580]
He says, what can I do for you? I said, Wednesday is payday, please make sure that I get paid on payday.

[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.580]
Is that a big request?

[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.300]
See, I am all about you because we've both been in the business about 100 years and worked for a lot of people.

[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.400]
Payday to me was never an issue.

[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.900]
It's a very least they can do.

[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:23.080]
Yeah.

[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.020]
I mean, that's it.

[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.700]
It would think that that's what we're showing up for every day is to get paid on payday.

[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:28.000]
Yeah.

[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.240]
And not all to use about a beat, but it would be passed it by this one.

[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:39.480]
And the ironic part of this is that particular talent, I factored over there twice because he was off in California

[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.620]
doing a basketball game for three days one time.

[00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.720]
So it was given to Duff the first time.

[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.520]
And then when I was told, well, maybe we can't find it.

[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:47.900]
I factored again.

[00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.080]
And George and Josh both know this because it was put on clearances desk the second time.

[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.560]
So, clearance either wife does ask with it or he aided for a lunch or made a watercraft sandwich with it.

[00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.960]
I don't know what he did with it, but it was just among the missing again.

[00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.260]
And then the first response this morning, and I didn't sleep with a crap last night.

[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.900]
It's just because it screws up all my bookkeeping.

[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.740]
We all have both ways that we do things.

[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.720]
I make all my deposits up here.

[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.900]
I send them down there, FedEx, and I have like assisted in my life and where everything goes.

[00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.740]
And when you're not going to get paid on payday, it screws everything up.

[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.060]
So I slept maybe three hours all night.

[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.860]
And then the first response from accounting back to this morning is, well, the first time we can write a check will be on next Wednesday, the first of January,

[00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.980]
and the first of February, right?

[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.600]
I bet you're back there in accounting.

[00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.380]
You know what? I've never had a problem with that here for some reason, but I had a problem.

[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.420]
If I haven't had a problem, 30 times, and George can verify it or any of the listeners, and I talk about it on the year just before I know I heard that.

[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.440]
No, I know. I know. I heard that.

[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.960]
My first small company, this is a joke company. This isn't a real company. This is a make-believe company.

[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.360]
Just let's look at a thing with DirectTV where they automate the 800 bucks and we had DirectTV shut off.

[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.920]
See, it's like if you go to the track and you keep buying tickets, you keep making wagers.

[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.860]
But when you go to cash, you're like, oh, well, we don't give any money out. We only take it in.

[00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:05.120]
Yeah, it's like if you go to your local bank and the ATM says, incoming only, don't try to withdraw any money here.

[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.900]
We just accept deposits. We're not giving any of it back, though.

[00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:13.040]
And that's the way they want life to work with the beesleys. They make it so difficult for you to get your money from them.

[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.080]
It just tears your kishkis out. So I'm a little out of sorts to say the best.

[00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.600]
I understand. I've had that trouble at times with the SBN with Disney.

[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.300]
Really? Well, you know how that's, you know, a big nut to crack.

[00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.580]
It's because of the way the corporation is structured.

[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.600]
Yeah. It goes from the...

[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.080]
But keep, I can see I could understand that.

[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.500]
It's a big corporation. Things can be lost in the cracks.

[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.040]
But this is a mom and pop operation here. This is not a big corporation.

[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.540]
They like to have people think it is.

[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.440]
You know, we're on a Nasdaq Stock Exchange.

[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.620]
Yeah, right. It's a mom and pop corporation.

[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.840]
It's a Georgian Carolina Bruce Beasley and Joyce.

[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.040]
And that's basically it.

[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.220]
You know, on a bunch of flunkies. It's too many steps.

[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:53.660]
That's what it feels.

[00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.080]
Well, when you got nobody to like...

[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.020]
I emailed Joe Bella five o'clock this morning because I couldn't sleep.

[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.320]
And I just got another message from him back, which I appreciate his efforts.

[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.720]
But nobody should have to go through all of this to get paid on payday.

[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.400]
Over and over and over again.

[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.760]
You know, this is him about the best laid plans of Mice and Man.

[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.820]
So you can say that Joe is, you know, on to what's going on.

[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.760]
It's got to be a while before he catches that.

[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.820]
And you were the one that told me yesterday that Greg Reed has got 10 more years on his deal with him?

[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:21.720]
As a consultant.

[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.020]
Oh, oh my God.

[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.420]
I think all that band you're picking up there in the tree has affected what used to be a brain.

[00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.340]
Actually, it was 11 years.

[00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.600]
Yeah, just to make me feel worse.

[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:32.740]
So I'm not going to be around it alone.

[00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:33.580]
I'm probably going to be alive.

[00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.220]
Another 11 minutes based on him.

[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:40.140]
Is that to be ward him for his incompetence and all the bad things that he didn't.

[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.300]
Jeopardyzing the license and putting stern on the air and ferella on the air

[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:48.160]
and moving me to nine and hiring Moe and trying to fire George and all the other stuff he did.

[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:54.700]
I could write a book, not about QAM, not about this business, just about him, just about him.

[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.480]
And the reward for doing the things that he's done is to say,

[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.360]
hey, come on, consult us for 10 or 11 years.

[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.140]
We'll put you on a payroll.

[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.540]
Well, I think that's his deal.

[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.860]
We don't want to pay to people.

[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.160]
What do you mean that's his deal?

[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.240]
He had his deal for X number of years.

[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:08.380]
Get out of here.

[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.620]
Nobody went 20-year deal.

[00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:10.360]
I guess.

[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.940]
Even in sports, they don't give out 20-year deals.

[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.220]
Especially, the guys are like 50 years old.

[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:16.600]
I don't know.

[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:17.720]
I'm just a soldier here.

[00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:18.420]
Yeah.

[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.260]
They just come in, fight my battles every day and go.

[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:21.360]

[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.220]
Well, that's same with me.

[00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.020]
I just come in every day, try to show up and get in the car.

[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:24.920]
But I'll tell you one thing.

[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:27.360]
If I didn't get my paycheck, I would wake out.

[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:27.960]
Yeah.

[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:28.900]
Oh, haha.

[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:29.500]
Yeah.

[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.060]
So, wouldn't anybody.

[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.560]
Well, the tenth and the 25th.

[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:35.100]
Let me say it again.

[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:36.760]
Payday is not rocket science.

[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.760]
I mean, yeah, I make a lot of money there and I bring them in a lot of money.

[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.160]
And that's the way the deal's supposed to work.

[00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.180]
And I give them some big numbers.

[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.780]
And I expect to get paid on payday.

[00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.520]
I don't need anybody to kiss my ass.

[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.900]
I don't need any, you know, what clearance is to me.

[00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:48.620]
What do you need for me?

[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.160]
Just make sure I get paid.

[00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.340]
And he can't even do that.

[00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:52.700]
And then he leaves me a message.

[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.700]
He's getting on a plane.

[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.300]
He's leaving on a jet plane.

[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.960]
I tell you who should have been on a plane.

[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.720]
That guy that freaked out and jumped off the plane

[00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.300]
before the other day.

[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.740]
I said, he should have been on a plane.

[00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:02.420]
They want to serve him right.

[00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:06.480]
Cancel this freaking flight to Virginia to be a sports flunky with a hurry pains.

[00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.780]
I mean, don't you find it a little bit bizarre?

[00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:10.900]
Have you ever worked in a radio station with a program director

[00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.720]
who was a play by play guy?

[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.280]
This is your guy, right?

[00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:15.420]
This is your guy.

[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.420]
This is your guy who doesn't want to grow up.

[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.460]
He doesn't want to stop with a sports craft.

[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.820]
That's why when his boyfriend, Stugas, was over there on RFX,

[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.580]
the big 940 FOT sports, which I said about 10 minutes,

[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.240]
that's why he was helping a book guest on a competition

[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.780]
because it's his sports buddy.

[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:31.500]
He was helping a book guest.

[00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.320]
We have a fraternity there.

[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.000]
Don't you understand?

[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.660]
We have a hurricane fraternity.

[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.040]
And I don't know how he fits into that because George is

[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:38.700]
around to me this morning.

[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:39.660]
He didn't even go to school.

[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:40.320]
He went to Penn.

[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.500]
He went to State Penn.

[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.320]
Yes, Penn.

[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:43.280]
He didn't go to State Penn.

[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.160]
He went to State Penn.

[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.660]
I know, but that's my, I'm just, I'm bellishing a little bit.

[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:51.020]
He belongs in the State Penn for impersonating a program director.

[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.340]
I mean, how is it a little quizzling like this?

[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.160]
All of a sudden, is our program director and comes in and agitate.

[00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.060]
When my mother died, you're in a half hour ago.

[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.940]
I thought to myself, oh, you know, I mean, it's not a happy feeling

[00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.400]
when your mother dies, but nevertheless, after being nagged

[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.420]
for all those years of my life for like 62 years,

[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:12.060]
so that finally, I don't, they're got nobody to nag me anymore, you know?

[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.020]
Don't have to be, that's the one bright light.

[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.060]
I mean, she was 91 years a long time.

[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:16.800]
Good health.

[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:18.440]
Now I don't have to be nagged anymore.

[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.160]
I'm kind of like free.

[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:19.760]
Guess what?

[00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:26.300]
35 minutes on Friday, a performance that would just set your ass on fire.

[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.440]
You just wouldn't believe it.

[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.760]
And in your case, that would be a hell of a far-for-us fire.

[00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:31.320]
Believe me.

[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.380]
Talk about a gigantic roid.

[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.300]
How come I feel that I'm the only one that's talking.

[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:38.920]
I'm just taking it away.

[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:39.240]
Yeah.

[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:40.000]
Want me to say.

[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.160]
Nothing, nothing like you said.

[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.920]
You said it was you, you go ballistic.

[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:44.760]
I have.

[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.660]
I just, I think it's happened to me twice here in all of these years.

[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.600]
Because I have a system that's like foolproof.

[00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:51.820]
I mean, it's just automatic.

[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:52.600]
I got a friend here.

[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:53.540]
It does all my bills.

[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:54.600]
I sign a bunch of checks.

[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.180]
He goes to the post office, gets the mail, gets the checks man.

[00:10:58.420 --> 00:10:59.880]
I make the deposit stuff ahead of time.

[00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.080]
I FedEx him down there.

[00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.580]
And everything is like clockwork.

[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:03.500]
No problem, right?

[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:04.580]
I'll tell you something.

[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:09.560]
When the floor in the system is not the post office and the post office is involved,

[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:10.820]
that's saying something.

[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.560]
The thought, the thorn has never been the post office.

[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.720]
Never had any, first of all, we're not using the post office.

[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.780]
We use FedEx or a DHL.

[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.000]
So that's never a problem.

[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.320]
The problem is that, okay, most of the time, this is currently one of his,

[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.640]
I don't know how many times, but usually it's corporate.

[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.000]
Because like I said, they want to pay people on the installment plan,

[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.580]
underland the STALL.

[00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.780]
They like to stall and ham and awe.

[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.660]
And but it would be, but it would, just like these to pay,

[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.020]
remember all the problems that Wayne had, giving the money for the,

[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.320]
right, for the broadcast rights?

[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:40.800]
Oh, yeah.

[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.100]
They used to be like a major scandal in fact,

[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.620]
Barry used to put that in the paper all the time just to give a little silt

[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.660]
to his buddy Greg, the 11 year man.

[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:49.100]
Remember those days?

[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:50.000]
I saw what he did.

[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:50.140]
I saw what he did.

[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:51.240]
Well, a million short, we either,

[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.980]
I heard the complaints from the doffens.

[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:54.440]
Right.

[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.420]
I wonder how they do it now over there,

[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.140]
where they got to, you know, make believe,

[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.880]
loan by the R radio over there across the street with Joel Feinberg,

[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:02.820]
with a four and a half million.

[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.260]
I wonder if he, well, of course, he's got daddy's money though.

[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:05.960]
See, that's different.

[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.460]
As Greg once said, it's one thing to be a big shot with your own money.

[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.560]
It's another thing to be a big shot with other people's money.

[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:12.440]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:12.940]
Yeah.

[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:17.480]
Well, he didn't, makes me want to reconsider my whole life here.

[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:17.980]
Yeah.

[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.300]
Yeah, but you're not having any problem.

[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.060]
He must like you.

[00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:24.460]
I get paid on the, I've been days and you're making me go to my life.

[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.200]
I get paid on the fifth and the 20th.

[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:28.800]
Well, yeah, that's because you got to write the positive.

[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.600]
They tell me they keep telling me I can't do that.

[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:32.800]
Oh, because you're in Canada?

[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.000]
No, because no, I don't get paid here.

[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.500]
The text don't come here.

[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.000]
I could understand if they were coming here.

[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.560]
They go right to my box there.

[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:40.260]
So why?

[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.640]
Why can't they do you direct deposit?

[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:43.680]
I don't understand it.

[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:44.360]
Ask them.

[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:48.800]
Ask if your program director ever comes back from being a make believe play by play girl.

[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.320]
I mean, guy, ask him why they can't do that.

[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.060]
Ask the program director.

[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:53.880]
There you go.

[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.700]
In fact, maybe there's a new segment for you.

[00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:56.720]
I used to do that.

[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:57.600]
I know that.

[00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.240]
Now, which PD was that?

[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:00.240]
There was an up or a gear?

[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:00.720]
Andrew Ashwood.

[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.420]
Oh, Andrew Ashwood?

[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:03.040]
Yeah.

[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:03.800]
How's he doing?

[00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:04.740]
I mean, how's he doing?

[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:10.460]
Well, just to show you that there is no basis for judgment in his business.

[00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:11.020]
Yeah.

[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.860]
He's in charge of some major radio network.

[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:14.660]
There you go.

[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:16.280]
I bet he's got 11-year contract, too.

[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.500]
He could be.

[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.920]
He's been there for about five already.

[00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.620]
One of these days, next time you and I talk off the air, remind me to tell you a great

[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.920]
Andrew Ashwood story that I'm sure you're not aware of.

[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.640]
But you talk about slipping your lid.

[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.700]
You'll just laugh so hard your innards may fall out.

[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.040]
He's well, listen, huh?

[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.400]
He's with one of the big...

[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:33.920]
What's it?

[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.340]
I forget which...

[00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:36.920]
The one that was based in San Antonio.

[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.460]
What network was based in San Antonio?

[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:40.380]
You're asking me?

[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.600]
Oh, I thought you knew.

[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:42.360]
I don't...

[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.600]
I try to avoid this business.

[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:44.360]
I don't know.

[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.620]
Maybe it's Emmis, but that sounds too Jewish to be in San Antonio.

[00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:48.200]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.500]
He loved San Antonio.

[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:53.500]
Right now, Andrew Ashwood's program director for Fox Sports Radio.

[00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.100]
Wow.

[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.740]
Well, that's your face right in.

[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:56.660]
Hey, Andrew.

[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:57.520]
You're fairies.

[00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.100]
Anyway, don't forget, let me tell you that story.

[00:13:59.260 --> 00:13:59.480]
It'll...

[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.440]
Sounds good.

[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.640]
It'll curl your hair, the few that you got left.

[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.400]
Well, listen, it's already 10-13 and we're already past the first break.

[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.560]
But, you know, I don't really care because I'm just...

[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.580]
I'm in Lala, Landa.

[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:10.660]
I just didn't sleep.

[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:11.460]
Sure.

[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.980]
This is not the way to treat people.

[00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:15.780]
You know, this is the way this company treats people.

[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:16.880]
And then you got the PD.

[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.600]
Oh, wow, I'm getting on a plane.

[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.880]
See, it wouldn't have bothered me nearly as much as if I had the feeling that he was actually going to be there.

[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.600]
And I will tell you, he was involved in a couple of calls this morning because probably Joe must have gotten a hold of him and ripped him and asked.

[00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:29.080]
But this isn't...

[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.220]
Make up your mind, clearance.

[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.160]
Program director or sports, little boy.

[00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:35.020]
Okay, make up your mind what you want to be.

[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.800]
This is a major market radio station alleged.

[00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:44.480]
We can't afford the luxury of a part-time program director who wants to play sports and take showers with the guys after the games.

[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.380]
Anyway, you have yourself a great day.

[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.440]
I hope things get better for you today.

[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.120]
Gosh.

[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:50.960]
Yeah.

[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.100]
I mean, I don't want to hear you like this.

[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.100]
You're the one who told me, but I understand.

[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.660]
Take the money to the bank.

[00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:59.440]
But you can't take the money to the bank.

[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.160]
That's the deal.

[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.300]
Take it right to the bank if they give it to you.

[00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:04.080]
Have a great day.

[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:04.460]
You too.

[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.580]
You call this big market radio?

[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:10.380]
Ooh.

[00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:18.880]
Hey, clearance.

[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:20.300]
You idiot.

[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:21.300]
Okay.

[00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:53.320]
Hey, hey.

[00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:02.380]
Hey, hey.

[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:02.380]

[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:02.380]

[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:02.620]
Hey, hey.

[00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:02.620]

[00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:05.140]
Hey, hey.

[00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:08.900]
Hey, hey.

[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:12.260]
Hey, hey.

[00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:13.940]
Hey, hey.

[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:13.940]

[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:13.940]

[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:13.940]

[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:13.940]

[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:13.960]
Hey, hey.

[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:13.960]

[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:14.100]
Hey, hey.

[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:15.620]
Hey, hey.

[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:15.620]

[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:15.620]

[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:15.620]

[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:15.620]

[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:15.740]
Hey, hey.

[00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:16.180]
Hey, hey.

[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:16.180]

[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:16.280]
Hey, hey.

[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.580]
Hey, hey.

[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:20.280]
Hey, hey.

[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.100]
Hey, hey.

[00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:38.820]
Hey, hey.

[00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:41.940]
Hey, hey.

[00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:43.060]
Hey, hey.

[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:43.100]
Hey, hey.

[00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:43.120]
Hey, hey.

[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:43.120]

[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:43.120]

[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:43.120]

[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:43.120]

[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:43.120]

[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:43.720]
Hey, hey.

[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:43.720]

[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:43.720]

[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:43.920]
Hey, hey.

[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:44.060]
Hey, hey.

[00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:44.520]
Hey, hey.

[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:44.960]
Hey, hey.

[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:44.960]

[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.620]
Hey, hey.

[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:49.480]
Hey, hey.

[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:50.260]
We came out Samuel'sああ m Westminster

[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:50.260]

[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:50.260]

[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:50.260]

[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:50.260]

[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:50.260]

[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:50.260]

[00:16:55.660 --> 00:17:19.600]
play us then pose for a second or two, and then,

[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.240]
that& and, everybody plays you off the stage.

[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.420]
In the years resolutions this year you have the best chance to lose weight and get healthy

[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:23.720]
again.

[00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:26.960]
Balance for life and this year we're trying to get the beast ready for his wedding day.

[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.060]
At least keep him alive for a long.

[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.340]
And maybe one of these mornings he'll come and actually give us an update and let us know

[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:31.880]
how he's doing.

[00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:35.400]
What could be easier than getting three gourmet meals and two delicious snacks delivered

[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:39.140]
every day right to your doorstep in a little blank sack and you still lose weight like crazy

[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:43.400]
the way it pours off your ass and because you have five feetings a day you're not starving

[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.660]
all day long like those other deals.

[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:48.120]
You don't have to slurp around in the gym and fight all those other small people and take

[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:51.860]
showers with strangers sit back and eat delicious gourmet meals in fact they send you

[00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:55.540]

Wonder how the beast is doing.

[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.120]
This is meal Roger's.

[00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.840]
This is 5.69

[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.880]
Every time he's doing this the way God wants it to be.

[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.760]
He wants to take a seat and cover it and sleep.

[00:18:50.360 --> 00:19:00.700]
He wants to make a new order.

[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:00.960]

[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.280]
He wants to make a new order.

[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.340]
He wants to make a new order.

[00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:04.340]

[00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:04.860]
He wants to make a new order.

[00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:05.660]
He wants to make a new order.

[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:05.660]

[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:05.660]

[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:05.660]

[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:05.660]

[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:05.660]

[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:05.660]

[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:05.880]
He wants to make a new order.

[00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:06.740]
He wants to make a new order.

[00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:25.080]
He wants to make a new order.

[00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.060]
He wants to make a new order.

[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:30.480]
That's 10 blocks that come together.

[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:38.020]
Next time, for us to rebuild a New Orleans, the one that should be uptown all the way

[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:43.880]
over the hill, this city will be chocolate, a chocolate New Orleans.

[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:49.000]
He never takes the blame, or anything he says.

[00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:54.340]
Chocolate, at the end of the day, that shopper in some coffee and a f*** of wine for theirs.

[00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:55.360]
Renaming him.

[00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:59.180]
Renaming him.

[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:00.540]
No, I can't.

[00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:06.280]
Renaming him since he wants to make new Orleans taste good.

[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.620]
You can't have New Orleans no other way.

[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:11.480]
It was the main cause.

[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:14.820]
Oh yeah, how about like a little mocha latte would be good too.

[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.980]
You idiot, you whizzling, you simple-dun man.

[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:17.680]
What a jerk.

[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.900]
10, 23 and 5, 60, WQA and happy Tuesday too.

[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:22.640]
Is that what day it is?

[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:23.320]
Yeah.

[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:28.200]
I thought I mentioned this fact we got early this morning about the Bobby Kennedy shooting.

[00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:29.380]
I'll show up for the pool today.

[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.620]
But in the midst of all the sick hosts, I always go like, uh-huh.

[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:33.560]
Yeah, let's get that on there.

[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:34.380]
Yeah.

[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:37.900]
In fact, it's a good fact here from Bob and Coral Springs.

[00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:40.660]
He says, um, oh, and you'd have been very impressed.

[00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:41.600]
Just suds called in yesterday.

[00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:42.300]
Daddy.

[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:46.260]
Daddy wanted today's pool, which we got to get to yesterday's first, but yeah, because

[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:50.500]
he actually saw a live on TV, the news broadened the service zone that the lure brings out

[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:50.900]
on the air.

[00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:52.080]
Wow, that must have been something.

[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.820]
And there's somebody else saw it too.

[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:54.800]
Maybe they saw it on tape.

[00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:58.460]
I don't know if they saw it live, because that wasn't required for the pool, which by

[00:20:58.460 --> 00:20:59.580]
the way, two people let's saw it.

[00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:00.200]
I'll make you proud.

[00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:03.800]
I was going to say, I forgot to tell you yesterday that at the end of the article that I

[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.340]
read, that inspired network.

[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:07.180]
Really?

[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:07.640]
Really?

[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.100]
And then you fell asleep.

[00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.020]
I wish I was still.

[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:11.460]
I can't.

[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.960]
I was hoping for the fall asleep right now.

[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.680]
God, if anybody needs it.

[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:19.340]
Anyway, Bob says, um, my nomination is the Bobby Kennedy shooting in 68.

[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:22.040]
And of course, we didn't see that live on the air, but we did see that.

[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:25.940]
And most of the, a lot of these we didn't see live, but we saw the, uh, films.

[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:28.440]
They didn't have no video back in end, but the film of it.

[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.900]
And, uh, I don't know.

[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.680]
When you see it live, it's got much greater impact.

[00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:34.560]
Although the film was pretty scary too.

[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:39.860]
The fact that, uh, Sirhan, Sirhan shot about 82 shots out of one gun was pretty

[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:40.740]
old, you know?

[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:44.520]
However, says Bob, my vote is gone to the Ruby shooting really Harvey Oswald.

[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.320]
So Bob must be an old user like me too, because it says there are only a few moments in

[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.540]
life where you can remember where you were at the exact moment.

[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:54.200]
As such things are normally the birth of a child, et cetera, just like the assassination

[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:54.760]
of Kennedy.

[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.000]
Yet I can remember sitting in my living room with my brother and parents glued to the

[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.540]
TV watching the Kennedy funeral in the events surrounding it when they start to bring

[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:07.020]
LHO out to armored the bank type of truck, Lee Harvey Oswald, and Ruby pops off the

[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:07.260]
shot.

[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:09.380]
Now I'm sure you've seen the film of that.

[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:09.720]
Yes.

[00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:11.420]
But I saw that live on TV.

[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.960]
NBC actually had their cameras under the Dallas police station.

[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.780]
They had the live feed.

[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:20.600]
And the guy who was covering it later became the president of NBC News.

[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.160]
I can't see him in his face.

[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.280]
I can't think of what his name was.

[00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:26.680]
It says, do you remember to look on Lee Harvey Oswald's face as well as the Dallas

[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:27.860]
cop in the white cowboy head?

[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:28.460]
Yes, Bob.

[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:29.020]
I certainly do.

[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:29.960]
Like always, yes, yes, today.

[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:32.060]
I see their watching on live TV.

[00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:36.040]
Here is a man who is accused of just assassinating the president of the United States.

[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:42.480]
And Lee Harvey and Jack Ruby, who was just a mobster, flunky hang around the cop station.

[00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:47.520]
One of those guys, they used to whine and dine the cops at his bar at his top of his

[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:47.620]
bar.

[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:48.860]
I didn't get him laid in whatever else.

[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:50.720]
And he just waddles in there.

[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:52.260]
He just happens because he's got his contacts.

[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.380]
There he knows what time they're going to be transferring Oswald to the prison.

[00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:57.640]
There's waddles in there and about a bane.

[00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:59.560]
Right in front of everybody's face.

[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:00.480]
Oh, gee.

[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.860]
I do remember to look on Oswald.

[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:02.720]
You saw that, didn't you?

[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:02.980]
Yeah.

[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.740]
Kind of a pained expression like something just shot him into a poopy.

[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:06.940]
Hey, I didn't see that coming.

[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:07.600]
Yeah.

[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.980]
Oh, like man at Hoi, like that, the guilty bit, you know, like that hoi, that time.

[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:13.720]
And I guess it probably did.

[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:16.340]
Well, we shouldn't have won Oswald around to talk too much.

[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:18.360]
And of course, Jack Ruby, well, I was a path see.

[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.380]
And then Jack Ruby was having that interview with Dorothy Kill-Gallon.

[00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:23.300]
She died mysteriously.

[00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:26.580]
And then all of a sudden, like overnight he got cancer and died in about two minutes.

[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:27.460]
That was really amazing.

[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.600]
I don't want to say it's a stretch of the imagination, but the government lies a lot.

[00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:34.220]
Kind of like the Greg Reed School, the 11 year man, you know him.

[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:35.580]
See, probably didn't believe that.

[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:36.760]
So you heard it from the Humphers mouth.

[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:38.440]
Oh, yeah, I believe that what?

[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.320]
He's got 11 years on the payroll.

[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.640]
That's probably why they can't afford to pay the rest of us on time.

[00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:44.880]
Because they're paying important people like, great.

[00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:49.700]
Getting his reward for the fabulous things he's done.

[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.800]
He started screwing up even before I had the my first day on here.

[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.940]
You want to really spend the whole day talking about that today?

[00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.560]
See, the audience is probably, oh gee, we're second-tiering here.

[00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.480]
And you belly-hick about not getting paid all the money.

[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:03.140]
You know, and I can understand that because I've talked about it how many times?

[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:04.060]
About 30 minutes.

[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.420]
30 times in the last several years.

[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.380]
Remember the one day I just went on strike and I played music all day.

[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:09.740]
Right?

[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:12.540]
Well, that sounds like a winner because I was so pissed off.

[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:13.420]
And it just gets old.

[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.740]
There's no excuses for not paying people on payday.

[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.380]
This isn't rocket science.

[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:18.780]
This isn't like some complicated.

[00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:22.600]
We need to dig up Einstein's body and find out how do you get people paid

[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.460]
on payday?

[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.400]
How do we find those talent sheets?

[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:26.800]
Who do we have to pass it by?

[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:30.120]
How many committees do we have to pass it by and get it rubber stamped and approved?

[00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:31.860]
Is that what I'm going to like lie on here or something?

[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:32.120]

[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:33.600]
Just pay the freaking money.

[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:34.220]
That's all.

[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:37.200]
You cheap nose-picking, banjo-picking idiots over there.

[00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:40.260]
I think they're probably up in upset that Wilson Picked the idea of the day.

[00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:41.700]
Isn't that their middle name Picked?

[00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:44.520]
27 after 10 if I sound a little bit aggrieved.

[00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:48.500]

[00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.820]
You know, the one thing I've discovered in this business is the people are really

[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:03.280]
doing a good job that's screwed over every time and the flunkies that hangers on man,

[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:06.240]
air rake in there, they're taking home and they couldn't give a crap less.

[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:10.020]
Anyway, if your mattress is more than 10 years older, it's noticeably sagging or

[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:10.320]
lumpy.

[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.620]
It's time for a new one, folks.

[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.460]
Choose the complete line all the top names in the betting industry.

[00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:23.180]
Dialometrics take same day orders all day long from kettle to stew or from palm beach to

[00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:23.620]

Hands for nothing.

[00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.940]

[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:06.980]
Talent sheet that you fact in the clearance because he can't find it

[00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:10.280]

[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:14.220]
Let's get bigger every day. There is a really couldn't find Hank's ass with both hands

[00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:15.960]
What does that tell you how desperate he is?

[00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:17.820]
You know if he would just stay away from me

[00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:21.420]
He'd be a lot we'd both get along a lot better. I almost said like me and Mo

[00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:24.740]
Might me and clearance if he would just stay the hell away. No, no seriously

[00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:30.100]
You know as well as I do how many months it's been like over a year now that every time payday comes and passes like the next day

[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:33.800]
I start reminding the powers of being hey don't forget now two weeks till payday

[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:39.220]
I kind of half jokingly but knowing what a night mirror. It's always touch and go it is outfit

[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:42.640]
Oh, we got some story. Oh, well the package got left on the

[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:45.740]
Counter and then on the course there was a time they paid me twice

[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:49.160]
Remember that right? Yeah, and being

[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:53.460]
Being a schmuck I gave him the second check back because it was a very substantial

[00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:55.760]
Pay me twice for the same time period

[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.760]
I should have kept it just in case for the other times it wouldn't pay me at all

[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:03.280]
Listen, you should have put it in an escrow account. Yeah, that's right. And then it could like drawn on it like right now

[00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:07.600]
That's that's a good I could have drawn interest on it anyway the buffer account there

[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:13.700]
Yeah, for the times of the beesleys can't get around like and this business from that bitch back there in a county about well over

[00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:15.720]
The soonest week in place check is

[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:22.200]
When you told listen when you told me that if you had any idea how close I came to go and right back to bed

[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:25.180]
You have no clue. I mean, but it was not a curly bit of hair

[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:28.880]
It's not to them here at accounting when they can cut the checks as you know

[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:31.500]
That's not the point. It's also not up to them to make that decision

[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:34.100]
She should have asked of course you couldn't ask our program director

[00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:36.220]
Because he's like doing a ball game somewhere

[00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:39.480]
He was busy being Mike Rosen's all to you there from VLN

[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:43.820]
Not seriously. I just being a program director to major marker radio station

[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:47.180]
Isn't the kind of thing you learn on the job, you know, you don't get on the job

[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:52.260]
Training for being a PD you know like like like being on the on the job training to be a heart surgeon

[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:56.540]
It's just just not something that's done. It's very of course in QAM

[00:32:56.540 --> 00:33:01.320]
Religion 81 they don't like that politics 73 they shut it right off. All those right wingers too bad

[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:05.420]
You not see bastards mo how we did it at 68 well, you don't have to worry

[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:09.940]
Don't go to the news. We still got the great bits lot more coming fag stuff 66

[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:11.940]
They don't like that. Yeah stuff at all

[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:17.520]
Now see movies 50 see what I mean right? I thought that one guy would be the only one I call it

[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.780]
Oh when you guys talk about movies who wants to hear about more?

[00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:25.200]
I don't know when you guys talk about breathing the air. It's just you know who wants to breathe the fresh air

[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.920]
I don't I don't give it

[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:32.700]
But anyway 50 people I don't like to move radio stuff 44 like today for example talking about the inside stuff

[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:37.140]
And believe me. I'm not even closely. I love that stuff and I know that's what we were talking about yesterday

[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:39.860]
They love it. I think I left a spot out of my

[00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:45.220]
Thank you. I'm totally disorganized. Is that okay? Oh here it is. Here's the spot right there

[00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:47.060]
No, I'm not disorganized. I'm ahead of myself

[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.900]
Here's the spot for two day anyway getting back to the pool can I finish this place?

[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:55.560]
Radio stuff 44 music 42. I think that's primarily your crap right?

[00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:59.160]
That's me although I actually the guy to call it and did did mention you and your stuff

[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:03.880]
But obviously they hate my music much more because I'm an old toad and what do I know about music sports 34

[00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:07.980]
Sports food and restaurants 24 meals bedtime stories only 20

612 and gambling oven so they like gambling and sex and the pool which you see the and the bedtime story

[00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:24.080]
Well, you don't talk about gambling a whole lot and gambling. I think you probably don't really talk about it

[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:28.160]
Only with a hopper I talk about it and occasionally mentioned some I you know visits out to woodbine or whatever

[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:31.360]
No, we don't talk about it a whole lot and what's there to talk about right?

[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:03.780]

You know, yes, he is we had 10 people like Sean out there sending this new pool ideas. We wouldn't have to wrap our brain

[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:11.600]
To come up with the original great ideas, you know, I could I should hoard those up, but I don't know you better not

[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:15.200]
Mostly today I know the last thing in the last day of the world

5. Oh, it's just it's just mind blowing

[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:30.920]
You know, it's like it's like it's like the better the job you do for them the more they keep punishing you and punishing you

[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:34.620]
It's like remember when I came back up here about three weeks ago right after the a new year, right?

[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:38.440]
And I had that grow test the flight from a hell in fact

[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:40.960]
I should have jumped off of that plane and

[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:44.920]
Come back here at my pressure was higher in hell and I couldn't get it down and I come on the next to him

[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:49.260]
In fact, I took a sick day. That's the first sick day I take it in the years and I come back in there

[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:52.360]
And then the next day and I said please just everybody leave me alone

[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:55.160]
I still got my head is killing me. I'm finally got my pressure down

[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:58.180]
I had a really horrendous trip and incomes parents

[00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:00.120]
Bapapapah and income is Troy again

[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:05.280]
See we got a bunch of overgrown children there who don't understand that people are we're not we're not just ponds

[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:09.260]
Okay, we're not just pieces on a chessboard were human beings, okay?

[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:14.980]
And so you know you tell Troy to get lost right? Oh well when your people want to talk to my people since you don't want me in there

[00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:21.100]
We're like like like an overgrown child like like in the infant all I asked is that cut me some slack today

[00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:24.080]
I don't feel really good. I got bad blood pressure my head is splitting

[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:29.220]
Just stay away from me with your baby crap today and come back another no if you know your people on a talk

[00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:33.460]
I'm which of course would be a convenient excuse while we get no response on well how do you accounts are doing what?

[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:38.360]
Uh on anything, you know, that's a good excuse. Well, he's such a bastard anyway. He don't want us in there in a morning

[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:42.140]
Well, you got that right just stay the hell away like I said you idiot

[00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:44.200]
Go be a talk show host, okay?

[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:49.140]
Go be in fact maybe he can be the program director and these are inclerances in there because Troy obviously is looking to do anything

[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:52.400]
He said sell so maybe that's something you can do is be the PD

[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:53.580]
You think

[00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:59.360]
The most incredible thing you've ever seen on TV is oh listen. I'm only getting started now

[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:05.180]
I might just tell the whole story about Greg and Joyce and that contract because that was another classic example

[00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:08.480]
And they didn't not just to me although I don't know the degree that they did it

[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:11.320]
They pulled it on mad dog they pulled it on Hank all three of us

[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:18.440]
And those contract renewal deals there when the ticket was trying to get the Hank and mad dog to sign up over there and jump ship

[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:24.300]
But what they put us through and you could ask Norma can't she'll tell you what they put us through for day after day

[00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:25.840]
Just psychotic

[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:31.860]
Psychic like crazy people and Caroline Beasley and Joyce are telling what everybody's gonna sign these contracts

[00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:37.720]
And if you dare say anything against management or anybody of the sports franchises or anybody who ever went to a ball game

[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:42.960]
You're gonna be fired and you know and we're gonna sign that what kind of a contract is that nobody signed that

[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:47.480]
Kakka that's exactly what it was. That's what they could do with it. They could wipe with it

[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:50.740]
Just just show everybody what big bosses you are over there

[00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:54.360]
You're really very important over there in Naples Florida, man. You are really hot stuff man

[00:39:54.360 --> 00:40:00.960]
I can smell it all the way up here. I can smell it. God. I know that Beasley smell from a 1200 miles away

[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.840]
God the stench

[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:07.640]
We're very important people run a stock exchange. Yeah, right Caroline get serious get a life

[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:14.560]
Just pay the check. Okay. Just sign the check and quit dizzling around. Okay, the most incredible thing you've ever seen on TV is the 9-11 attacks

[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:17.120]
Passes everything because it was recent and because

[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.880]
Quite frankly whoever saw anything like that anyway

[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:25.000]
Especially when the towers fell and you notice how nobody talks about the people in the tower number two

[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.540]
That didn't have to die because they were told go back in a building now even taking into account the

[00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:35.960]
Flaw communication between the firemen and the police department because they hated each other like poison and that they were communicating well even

[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:42.960]
Setting that aside the FAA certainly had to know that there were four planes that were hijacked right right

[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:47.620]
I mean they knew that almost immediately it wasn't just the one the first one the one went in tower number one

[00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:51.960]
There were all these other planes that were missing and they were unaccounted for and it off the radar screen and off course

[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:56.020]
So they knew that there were series of planes that had been hijacked. That's correct

[00:40:56.020 --> 00:41:03.360]
So the possibility that there was going to be another plane hit there the idea sending those people back in there to put their lives in jeopardy

[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:08.220]
Would of course a lot of them did die the death tool there could have been a fraction of the

[00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:13.180]
Three thousand what it was if those people would have a back and a lot of more on the way out right a lot of those people

[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:16.720]
Run away all right. Oh go back everything's okay. We got the all clear. It's just the other tower

[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:22.880]
And you know, it's just a melting and gonna falling and a put other than that just tragic and nobody talks about any of these things

[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:29.900]
That's why we got all these commissions and these committees and they're studying this and there's the you know something they can take all of that and wipe your ass with it

[00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:34.120]
That that's the amount of good that it does because well, what is it ever changed? Does it change anything?

[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:41.220]
Oh nothing nothing just a lot of ruby it's okay because we want to like sweep everything out of the carpet and make people feel better

[00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:42.440]
Oh jeez

[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:47.440]
I'm sure that all the voters of us people have died on on 11 feels so much better now that we have those commissions

[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:52.520]
What which of course they were pushing for that but the problem is nothing ever gets done and do we hear any more about that?

[00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:56.460]
Why would we hear about that when we got all these cool mind disasters right?

[00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:00.780]
Right we have a missing chick from a Rubin a missing guy from the cruise ship why would we hear about talk?

[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:06.480]
I like that 9-11 attacks 389 or nothing like it hopefully never again 392

[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:10.860]
Neil Armstrong walks on the moon at least allegedly 47. I think that was in Nevada

[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:22.980]
Yeah, that's the one the one that they rushed because they wanted to get it ready for his statement the Union dress by the way

[00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:27.820]
They rushed it they want ready now they're all dead jack ruby should see Harvey Oswald right there

[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:34.140]
37 so must be a lot of other well. I guess you know you've seen the the film of it

[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:40.220]
But to see it live is really something right there unfolding right before your eyes the JFK assassination

[00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:40.960]

2000 lesson count 12 there went and how could it have only 12 in Florida man as long as we live

[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:51.480]

Let's have another one of those Vegas trips. By the way, thank you Bob Green for sticking it to us

[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:30.160]
See there was no money in for them so they didn't give a crap about it. They don't want to support me

[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:33.380]
And and you know something when you come right down to it and you know

[00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:38.540]
It's nice to think back in the past and nostalgic and about getting paid on time on payday which we did over there

[00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:43.460]
But what were we always bitch about the only thing they cared about which is why that bit came about

[00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:49.740]
I think I cared about was the kings and the dolphins and the dolphins and the kings and all the sales efforts went into that and a pregame and a postgame

[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:55.960]
Just like on this station we get a fast last week from an email from fat boy about how our the real pregame show sure kicked

[00:43:55.960 --> 00:44:02.720]

[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:58.600]
And because it's Ray Megan's racist peanut butter cops all the peanut butter has been moved off and replaced with chocolate

[00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:05.740]
That's the chocolate I'm talking about just the way God intent is the way God wants it to be

[00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:09.980]
And make sure to try the delicious chocolate drink Megan's work

[00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:14.000]
You mix it with white milk and it becomes a delicious drink

[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:18.300]
And for chocolate and nothing much chocolate try racist pieces

[00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:23.840]
You can't have chocolate no other way. Oh, yeah, I love it. I'll chew it 560. I hear it's real bad for you

[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:25.560]
And give you that BBs. That's what I'm hearing

[00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:27.300]
Yep, 560

[00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:32.340]
705 60 pound 560 into Verizon singular right aside. I don't know if I want to take any calls today

[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:37.240]
I'm just not in the mood, you know, well all these lines ringing you don't know they're flies you like crazy man

[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:39.620]
They're smoking very considered aren't they?

[00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:43.480]
Smoking something. Yeah. Well the guy I played must have been smoking something

[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.220]
I still say he should have been on clearances playing

[00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:48.160]
You know one taken to do that silly ass ball game up there in Virginia

[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:52.920]
Hey, it's the canes. Maybe it's the canes grow up already get a life you idiot

[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:58.220]
See that's another thing you know if um that nice lady that you said back in accounting was I know who she is

[00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:00.840]
Michelle who's always speaking whatever but it could have been either one of them

[00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:04.600]
But at any rate if she would like a gone to clearance to get a signature on the

[00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:06.380]
Calendashie that I faxed in

[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:08.400]
She'd have found an empty desk

[00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:12.880]
Right, you see you see how he works this guy? I yeah because he ain't there

[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:18.060]
And then she could have gone to see Duff but then again he's he's been relegated to the role of sales flunky now because

[00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:20.000]
I don't know. I guess he didn't have his head far enough

[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.820]
I thought after all his years he'd know where to stick it, you know and his head to you

[00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:28.620]
It's not alone. Yeah, but I guess Greg's uh, I guess it just wasn't enough room left back there

[00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:34.180]
What would Maddie Bell and Gary Sarner and the water Nazi and formerly scurrying you thought that when she dumped out of there

[00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:36.060]
It might have opened up a little uh crevice

[00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:38.020]
Or that that candy in the crevice

[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:41.480]
Oh, it's not so you put it there. Oh, yeah like crazy

[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.180]
Wtq.y.m. Hello

[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:53.560]
Okay, like I said, I don't think we're taking any calls today q.a.m. Hello

[00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:56.500]

For the one today or the one week from Stukas today the okay virgin Mary had toast

[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:14.020]
What a incredible I would agree with that the virgin Mary on the ride a whole week grilled for the whole week grilled cheese

[00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:16.700]
It was my real cheese virgin Mary on a grilled cheese. There you go

[00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:22.400]
And you know what kind of bread it was I do not it was wonder bread. Oh, I wonder wonder who wrote the book alive

[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:27.340]
But was it kosher her pay soft? That's the question. You know something. I haven't I haven't played that in

[00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:32.740]
She's on the docks

[00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:39.940]
And she needs to buy bread that is unleavened oh my god

[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:02.720]
And she's buying

[00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:04.740]
The bread is wonder

[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:15.500]
By the way stick it up our illustrious program director such as he is I hope you understand that they're in his

[00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:20.360]
His experience of life there are only two radio stations in the South Florida market

[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:25.620]
Us and the people across the street you do understand that don't you right good? That's not the case. Oh, I'm sorry

[00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:30.400]
W.A.M. Hello crankline. Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah, I have one for the

[00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:32.300]
The poll today okay

[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:35.480]
How about for all the getting hit in the face with the chair by

[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:37.800]
I thought we put that up there. I guess we left it off

[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:40.780]
We mentioned yesterday getting his nose busted with a chair

[00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:46.640]
You know perfect. I guess Josh you're filled on on the job. Thanks a lot, Sally. Thanks. Thanks. For all though gets a

[00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:52.340]
Bust in the nose man for live TV is funny. It was great and well deserved by the way

[00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:54.960]
We're gonna replace him with a clearance next show

[00:51:55.780 --> 00:52:00.760]
Spigna crazy people a passenger on board a delayed continental airlines flight from four loaded-eiled to newer became

[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:05.500]
Agitated yesterday. You see this guy nope. You didn't see him. Sorry. Oh, it's chocolate

[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:09.280]
Dark chocolate opened the door and jumped to the tarmac

[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:12.200]
Broward state of office visual so not that it makes any difference

[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:16.500]
I just mentioned that in passing and I'd like to know why he doesn't have a shirt on here put some clothes on pal

[00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:17.760]
shows the ABS

[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:22.780]
Oh, he's got a got him there or whoever that is that is and he's just standing with a shirt off

[00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:25.140]
Not a good idea on the plane man and pit starts to

[00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:29.820]
Maybe that's why he jumped out of his hunting there Troy Anthony Rigby 28 a pop-in-o beach

[00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:34.320]
ran toward the front of flight 408 is attached to the runway about 515 yesterday afternoon

[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:37.880]
Sheriff Ken Jenny said that's right the possum Ken Jenny

[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:43.380]
What is Troy? Oh, that's his name Rigby banged on the cockpit door the front door and the door in the food galley

[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:47.800]
Jenny said anybody home like like Michelle is doing on clearances door right now

[00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:56.520]
Passengers and crew rush to stop him in the ruckus a passenger was bitten on one hand and possibly broke the other hand on the other hand

[00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:56.820]
Wow

[00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:00.740]
Finally to crew the pressurized the plane so Rigby could open the front door

[00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:04.900]
Adjunny said when he jumped to the tarmac dip it he shot him twice with a taser

[00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:09.540]
It's absolutely bizarre Jenny said that it's the second time in South Florida

[00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:14.120]
Why did expect it there in a lot of stress a lot of pressure? Maybe he didn't get paid on time on payday

[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:18.900]
Think that could be would sent me off on December 7th federal air marshals fatally shot day

[00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:23.440]
Well, we know about that well he had that backpack. You know any we have said he had a bomb or somebody said he had a bomb and

[00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:27.820]
Yeah on the flight from Miami to Orlando as a precaution

[00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:33.220]
Rigby was taken a Broward General Medical Center for Lauderdale faces charges of criminal mischief criminal press passing

[00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:37.700]
Mr. Meener battery resisting arrestment violence and battery on a law enforcement officer

[00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:39.560]
Didn't say anything about Sally fits his battery

[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:42.860]
Paul singular for Lauderdale was in first class when Rigby rushed by

[00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:46.180]
He tried to subdue Rigby in what he described as a chaotic ordeal

[00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:49.340]
We all just sort of sat back and looked around like what happened

[00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:52.500]
Siggler said is right hand bandaged. You didn't know what he was gonna do

[00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:58.120]
Siggler said we'd be complained of claustrophobia as he struggled with flight attendance and three or four pastures

[00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:03.160]
The flight was delayed keep in mind was supposed to leave at 515 till 915 in the PM

[00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:06.180]
Well, it's a good thing. I wasn't clear. It's his flight. He missed his ballgame

[00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:10.520]
Oh, and what's life without that hurricane ballgame is right not worth living

[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:17.320]
That's correct. He complained to clonk. Here's my suggestion anybody out here's got claustrophobia. Don't get on a plane

[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:21.780]
Oh, they're concept. Yeah, it gets really a close in there

[00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:26.460]
You know especially when they close the door. That's why as we went in open the door a little fresh air and no

[00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:28.240]
Yeah, please, you know

[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:32.880]
Although quite frankly, it's a good thing. He did it at that point as opposed to like 27,000 feet

[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:35.340]
That's a good point. Yeah, I thought so

[00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:42.200]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound. I am so in coherent you have you can't even begin to imagine on your wildest dreams

[00:54:54.600 --> 00:55:01.220]

[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:07.560]
Get ready for the big celebration although who did I read about oh dick perton just got reupt in Detroit again for like the next

[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:10.900]
I think he's got 11 more years like Greg at the oldie station there

[00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:15.520]
He's been on the air for like 45 years in Detroit. There may be not in Detroit. He was in

[00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:21.540]
Baltimore for about five minutes and somewhere before that since an anti our girl old friend dick pernista college

[00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:53.680]

[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:05.040]

[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:27.540]
Panther previews speaking of your Florida Panthers man. They are

[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:30.240]
Something not like the Leafs but close

Void by a political resurrection in the French speaking Quebec the conservatives won the most seats in the 308 seat House of Commons

[01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:48.180]
Despite a campaign in which liberals tried to stop Harper by linking into American conservatives in general and George W. Bush in particular

[01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:52.900]
However as votes were counted the conservatives and I see this article was like before bet them they got

[01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:54.100]

[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:31.180]

[01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:47.620]
It's a done deal

[01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:53.580]
But they keep showing Lindsey Graham, okay? This is the guy that coached him one of the guys that was coaching him in a white house

[01:12:53.580 --> 01:13:01.100]
How to answer the questions and then he went through that long emotional speech about how they picked on him and the leader's wife starts crying and runs out of the room

[01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:04.580]
And he's gonna hold on this like there's some degree of objectivity

[01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:09.580]
This is some jackass that's gonna sit on a supreme court and decide the future in favor of people's lives and crap

[01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:14.560]
And immediately just put a beep but a boob at the day they know nothing. Okay. Don't confuse them with anything

[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:17.520]
Okay, when's the next whole mining disaster be sure nothing no one's gonna be

[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:20.640]
I'm gonna tell you who is really much into about nothing

[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:26.060]
See Rita Cosby's got an excuse. She's got no vocal chords. Okay. She's got an excuse besides being an idiot

[01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:32.360]
But the media they become obsessed with these mediocre people Anderson Cooper man. That's where he sends me

[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:37.400]
What do they see in him? What what's the big tennis with him? I think he's connected isn't his mom famous or something

[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:42.680]
Here she is. That's what I heard. Who is she Gary Cooper? No, somebody famous like a famous actress or somebody

[01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:48.780]
Anderson's Cooper. Yeah, I'm gonna have to do a bio now. I guess. Oh god. Yeah, just look right next to where it says

[01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:53.520]
Yeah, look next to that or just under under the paragraph. It says Anderson. You fair right there

[01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:55.140]
He is so

[01:13:55.780 --> 01:13:57.760]
Vanilla and so boring and

[01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:03.160]
He's like a step away from me to Cosby can barely get the words out. He is so weak

[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:08.540]
Nandy Pambi and I've got news for you. I mean Aaron Brown was whiny and wimpie and annoying too

[01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:13.060]
But Jesus got at least at least maybe he belonged on the air somewhere like maybe in peoria but somewhere

[01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:17.780]
But Anderson Cooper. Oh, let's see in our crazy. Who is it? Who's his mother Mary Martin? Yeah

The unartist and designer writer Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt. Well, how old is she about 98?

[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:47.900]
Like I guess Jesus Christ

[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:53.400]

[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:54.160]
Just give you some effort

[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:17.500]
Well, no, but the fact that they're on there it's a subliminal idea so that even though the links are dead people will say

[01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:20.180]
Well, gee, I should probably see that then they should see it

[01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:25.440]
But where they're gonna see it on the cbc and a variety of sites they have them available for download. There you go

[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:06.880]
I doubted supernatural. Maybe that'll make me feel like it does not conflict with the shield. Well, there you go

[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:12.980]
Hey, it's kind of interesting a show. It's uh the premises little shots. They've got some good shows on the WB and WB

[01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:17.180]
Right and time-welling ain't even in this one. All of the one guy. He is swelling but not time-welling

[01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:25.500]
You're gonna be swelling when you hear this a surge in oil prices last week to nearly $70 a barrel on a perfect storm of global energy related fears

[01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:30.300]
Only hints at what may lie ahead the experts be saying you mean to say it's not even new yet

[01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:35.640]
My head is just pounding like somebody's got a drum inside like the energizer bunny is banging on that drum slowly

[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:44.180]
Rocketly nervous investors look on his conflict ranges and several strategic areas of the world involving nations as disparate as Iran

[01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:45.980]
Iraq Saudi Arabia

[01:21:46.580 --> 01:21:48.580]
Ragheads Russia Ukraine Nigeria

[01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:54.580]
Venezuela China and the USA this morning Kuroa rose again and after hours

[01:21:55.380 --> 01:21:59.340]
Trading it rose 72 cents or 1.1 percent to 69

[01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:05.460]
20 is the call from sweeps across Europe experts say the Iran issue alone could push oil prices past

[01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:11.900]
$100 a barrel oh my god if the U.N. Security Council were to authorize sanctions against Iran

[01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:17.620]
Which the West accused of trying to make nuclear bombs or is that nuclear Iran is threatened to curb oil experts in retaliation

[01:22:17.620 --> 01:22:22.260]

Yeah, well Tessio won't see him no more

[01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:33.800]
Even if Iran pulled a small amount of its oil off the market says it say it pulled a half a million barrels a day

[01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:40.180]
I could see oil prices literally jumping over the hundred dollar a barrel marks a James Bartis a senior researcher at rank corp

[01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:46.740]
A sharpie global economic slowdown could follow that's the Dalima the US and European nations faces the desire whether to rack on Iran

[01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:52.300]
But Iran would also pay a hefty price if the petrol dollars and I represent 80% of export revenues are reduced

[01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:58.900]
Potentially stirring civil unrest in the country that's already got a 14% unemployment rate. How do you like that?

[01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:03.040]
Don't so instead of going into the country where we should have gone and therefore were going in anywhere

[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:06.360]

[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:07.740]

797 on the uphold you ever fly 797 just wait till they build it the most incredible thing you've ever seen on TV is the 911 attacks

[01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:36.780]
506 goes without saying over 63%

[01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:40.720]
We're still trying to soak it in believe it. We're hoping it was just a bad dream

[01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:43.760]
But then bin Laden's and bushes man they had some issues

[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:47.640]
I guess and then of course there was that Pentagon can't find a scrap at that plane

[01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:51.480]
But that one of flame right there in the Pentagon must have gone deep inside

You know, if you've got a program director who's not capable of getting people's talent sheets turned in and signing them and getting them paid

[01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:22.360]
Maybe what we need is a full-time program director instead of a want to play sports the baby kind of guy

[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:25.240]

[01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:36.080]

[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:45.500]
Try to hit something out of that hip we like trying to hitch a hitch a wagon on the side of the the earth on side of Uranus

[01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:49.840]
God, but in any race the beat goes on so we got good intentions there

[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:52.500]

A long long time ago

[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:26.680]
He was 1900 and Jesse Helms was just a lad of nine

[01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:31.420]

[01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:44.440]

The war events that made you shiver

[01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:51.140]
But there were times we did deliver

[01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:55.260]
A promise that was kept

[01:29:55.260 --> 01:30:06.020]
With that famous one small step I can't remember each event or everything that man did invent

[01:30:07.180 --> 01:30:10.520]
A century we were presents

[01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:15.740]

And that we say goodbye it all happened in the blink of a night

[01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:39.760]
A hundred years have gone by

[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:40.480]

And West think it was brand new and then Russia had its revolution

[01:31:23.820 --> 01:31:27.700]

[01:32:57.900 --> 01:32:59.240]
Many tears we declined.

[01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:02.660]
For the century it's time that we say goodbye.

And they were singing my, my habit time is devised.

[01:36:51.340 --> 01:36:55.100]
It's started some before many tears we declined.

[01:36:55.100 --> 01:36:59.060]
For the century it's time that we say goodbye.

[01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:02.500]
It all happened in the blink of a night.

[01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:06.920]
A hundred years have gone by.

[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:36.840]
That's great because it's long.

[01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:39.420]
And the reason I played it.

[01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:42.880]
By the way I got the facts you just sent me here.

[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:50.380]
The amazing thing about it is so many things that are pulled.

[01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:52.280]
They see how topical and timely that is.

[01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:54.640]
Yeah like the Hindenburg.

[01:37:54.780 --> 01:37:58.460]

We've all seen it.

[01:38:02.620 --> 01:38:04.980]
We heard that phrase from Chicago.

[01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:07.860]
I'm sure I was in Jersey right?

[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:13.340]
It sounded like Joe Zagaki so hysterical.

[01:38:13.460 --> 01:38:14.480]
The King just wrote a touchdown.

[01:38:14.940 --> 01:38:16.080]

[01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:24.540]
I don't want to read that whole list here.

[01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:25.380]
I've just got through doing that.

[01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:26.020]
It's your bad.

[01:38:26.220 --> 01:38:27.280]

[01:38:30.660 --> 01:38:32.460]
You know you just reach a saturation point.

[01:38:32.900 --> 01:38:37.380]
I think that all of us in life we have like an aggravation meter in our brain.

[01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:38.340]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:39.580]
In other words a quotient.

[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:43.820]
And when it's like filling up a gas tank where when it gets full to the brain

[01:38:43.820 --> 01:38:46.920]
and when you start to pop it off the tank, it like start to spew it up.

[01:38:47.100 --> 01:38:47.420]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:38:47.540 --> 01:38:48.280]
Like skilling over?

[01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:51.600]
And I think I got spill over today from a crack.

[01:38:52.820 --> 01:38:53.900]

[01:38:58.140 --> 01:38:59.060]
Oh my God.

[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:01.820]
Take all these people and put them on death row.

[01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:02.160]
Okay.

[01:39:02.780 --> 01:39:05.720]
And you know talk about larceny in people's hearts.

[01:39:05.860 --> 01:39:07.180]
I'm so sick and tired of this crack.

[01:39:08.260 --> 01:39:10.820]
I mean everybody's belly aching about the government and rightfully so.

[01:39:10.820 --> 01:39:14.000]
The government is listening on your conversations and you're opening your mail.

[01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:18.200]
How about all these companies that are like selling your private information for Christ's sakes?

[01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:23.900]
The state attorney general's orifice today sued a Fort Lauderdale corporation and its officers alleging the firm

[01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:27.700]

The firm first source information specialist ink is accused of providing its customers with confidential telephone calling records

[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:36.360]
of unsuspecting consumers.

[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:39.300]
The Florida attorney general's orifice said in a prepared release.

Everybody in Leon County?

[01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:44.520]
Not that I can recall.

[01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:45.980]
That's how I hazy in it.

[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:47.920]
Must have a long time ago.

[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:48.340]
Remember Leon?

[01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:48.900]
No.

[01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:49.700]
Who is Leon?

[01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:50.880]
When there's somebody named Leon?

[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:52.160]
Think about it.

[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:52.640]
Okay.

[01:39:52.900 --> 01:40:00.100]
The state claims first source to the seed telephone companies by impersonating either customers or company employees in order to obtain the personal calling information

[01:40:00.100 --> 01:40:04.960]
in violation of the Florida Onfair and Deceptive Practices Act and civil conspiracy laws really said.

[01:40:05.380 --> 01:40:08.800]
Oh, if we have a Florida Onfair and Deceptive Practices Act, how can the beesleys be invineless?

[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:09.340]
I'm sorry.

[01:40:09.820 --> 01:40:16.680]
An undercover investigation by the fear of Florida Public Service Commission confirmed that the website should offer to sell a list of calls made for many given phone number including cell phones.

[01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:23.860]
This is beyond an outrage and a gross invasion of privacy set attorney general Charlie Chris Dufair, who is running for governor.

[01:40:23.860 --> 01:40:24.160]
Yes.

[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:30.300]
Citizens have a right to expect that their private personal telephone records will not be used as a cash cow for a third party.

[01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:31.940]
Oh, I wasn't even invited to the first party.

[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:32.240]
Were you?

[01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:33.120]
No, I wasn't.

[01:40:33.540 --> 01:40:38.440]
According to the state, first source runs several websites that offer call lists to anyone who wishes to purchase them.

[01:40:38.860 --> 01:40:44.820]
Investigators determine that buyers did not have to provide any ID to obtain the records and only need to provide the telephone number to be looked up.

[01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:48.720]
How do you like that?

[01:40:49.180 --> 01:40:50.640]
They sell on your phone numbers.

[01:40:50.780 --> 01:40:53.260]
They're canceling my blackberry probably pretty soon.

[01:40:53.260 --> 01:40:54.300]
They're going to put them on a binus.

[01:40:54.620 --> 01:40:56.840]
I thought they settled on something.

[01:40:57.320 --> 01:40:58.920]
They didn't and they renegade on it.

[01:40:59.040 --> 01:40:59.300]
Oh, man.

[01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:00.300]
They settled.

[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:01.680]

That's just another thing.

[01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:06.940]
Although it's a Canadian company, I wonder if they would stay in business.

[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:09.000]
I mean, how many subscribers could they have in Canada?

[01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:10.020]
About 30, man.

[01:41:10.220 --> 01:41:10.760]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:12.800]
Certainly not enough to stay in business.

[01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:14.760]
Well, they'll see me.

[01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:16.980]
They'll just cut their payroll way down.

[01:41:16.980 --> 01:41:18.180]
You know, like we're doing.

[01:41:18.900 --> 01:41:20.420]
Going all the wrong people out the door.

[01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:21.760]
Well, I'm not saying all the wrong people.

[01:41:22.180 --> 01:41:24.340]

They don't win this game tonight.

[01:41:41.420 --> 01:41:41.900]
Bye-bye.

[01:41:41.900 --> 01:41:46.300]

[01:41:55.020 --> 01:41:55.280]
No.

[01:41:55.780 --> 01:41:56.540]
Remember they were belly-like.

[01:41:56.540 --> 01:41:58.140]
You know, we got to have the on-campus arena.

[01:41:58.260 --> 01:41:59.560]
That's why we're not drawing flies.

[01:41:59.940 --> 01:42:01.300]
And they built the on-campus arena.

[01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:01.900]
Guess what?

[01:42:02.340 --> 01:42:02.460]
What?

[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:03.780]
They're not drawing flies.

[01:42:04.260 --> 01:42:05.620]

You're fair.

[01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:37.140]
And actually, they showed some clips in the audience during the news.

[01:50:37.540 --> 01:50:42.100]
And because of the fact it was stacked mostly by Bush liquors as a result,

[01:50:42.260 --> 01:50:45.160]
they were like, hey, you could see a couple of kids,

[01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:46.560]
college kids, and they were like, whoa!

[01:50:46.900 --> 01:50:48.960]
Like that with their hands passed, but you couldn't hear them, you know?

[01:50:49.980 --> 01:50:53.080]
And that's the way there's another staged event by your fashions president.

[01:50:54.140 --> 01:50:55.940]
Anyways, speaking of Samuelito, this is a good lead,

[01:50:55.940 --> 01:50:57.740]
and at the historic swaring in a John Roberts,

[01:50:57.880 --> 01:50:59.940]
as the 17th Chief Justice of the USA,

[01:50:59.940 --> 01:51:04.340]
SA, 9 September, and remember the Supreme Court except Antonin Scalia was in attendance.

[01:51:04.840 --> 01:51:09.200]
ABC News has learned that Scalia instead was on a tennis court at one of the country's

[01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:14.020]
top resorts, the Ritz Carlton Hotel, in Bachelor Galsch, Colorado, during a trip to a legal

[01:51:14.020 --> 01:51:16.240]
seminar sponsored by the Federalist Society.

[01:51:16.780 --> 01:51:20.200]
Not only did Scalia's absence appear to be a snub of the new chief justice, but according

[01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:23.700]
to some legal ethics experts, it also raised questions about the propriety of what

[01:51:23.700 --> 01:51:27.400]
critics called judicial junkets, at least he wasn't duck-hutton with the vice president,

[01:51:27.620 --> 01:51:27.920]
just wait.

[01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:32.200]
It's unfortunate, of course, that's what kept him from this war again was an activity

[01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:37.200]
that in and of itself is dubious ethical propriety since Stephen Gillers, an NYU law professor

[01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:38.880]
who's a recognized scholar on legal ethics.

[01:51:39.220 --> 01:51:43.140]
Scalia spent two nights at the luxury resort lecturing at the legal seminar where ABC News

[01:51:43.140 --> 01:51:47.600]
also found him on the tennis court, heading out for a fly-fishing expedition and socializing

[01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:51.500]
with members of the Federalist Society, the conservative activist group that paid for the expenses

[01:51:51.500 --> 01:51:52.100]
of his trip.

[01:51:52.700 --> 01:51:56.260]
At a press conference, almost two weeks later, Scalia was not inclined to tell reporters his

[01:51:56.260 --> 01:51:57.660]
wear-boats during Robert's War again.

[01:51:58.100 --> 01:52:00.860]
I was out of town with a commitment I couldn't break and that's what the public information

[01:52:00.860 --> 01:52:01.600]
office told you.

[01:52:01.700 --> 01:52:05.460]
He said, it doesn't matter what it was, it was a commitment I couldn't break he continued

[01:52:05.460 --> 01:52:06.520]
with question further.

[01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:07.580]
How do you like that?

[01:52:08.300 --> 01:52:09.520]
What a crocker, crap.

[01:52:09.660 --> 01:52:10.560]
What about your crooks?

[01:52:11.300 --> 01:52:14.620]
The fascists have taken over and you heard it first right here when they showed that nobody

[01:52:14.620 --> 01:52:18.540]
knows about best kept secret in the USA, the near Roger show, where you can't even get

[01:52:18.540 --> 01:52:19.300]
paid on payday.

[01:52:19.500 --> 01:52:23.660]
That's how shabbily they treat us, like crap, like garbage, like the stuff you scrape

[01:52:23.660 --> 01:52:25.000]
off at the bottom of the barnacles.

[01:52:25.160 --> 01:52:30.260]
You know the barnacles on the bottom of a ship, whatever the slime is underneath the barnacles,

[01:52:30.380 --> 01:52:32.100]
that's the way they treat us, just like that slime.

[01:52:32.460 --> 01:52:34.080]
Ooh, Barnacles, do you feel like unclean?

[01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:35.660]
Yeah, well, I'm used to that.

[01:52:36.140 --> 01:52:38.340]
Every time I look at that check, I feel unclean.

[01:52:39.080 --> 01:52:42.180]
27 past noon, of course I can't look at it, then you got it.

This city will be chocolate, a chocolate noir.

[01:55:14.140 --> 01:55:15.700]
It never takes the blame.

[01:55:17.560 --> 01:55:20.780]
For anything you say, chocolate at the end of the day.

[01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:25.380]
That chocolate ends up on the edge of a one called Ed's Renegant Day.

[01:55:28.260 --> 01:55:29.260]
Renegant Day.

[01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:30.540]
No, I can't.

[01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:32.740]
Renegant Day.

[01:55:36.200 --> 01:55:39.620]
You can't have no other way.

You can't have no other way.

[01:56:55.620 --> 01:56:57.020]
You can't have no other way.

You can't have no other way.

[01:56:58.460 --> 01:56:59.800]
You can't have no other way.

[01:57:00.340 --> 01:57:01.000]
You can't have no other way.

[01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:02.480]
You can't have no other way.

[01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:02.520]

[01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:04.860]
You saw it on the news because I didn't see it.

[01:57:05.020 --> 01:57:05.060]
No.

[01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:05.520]
What?

[01:57:06.020 --> 01:57:16.300]
Speaking of Norellines, they showed a, they had one of those town hall seminars with people that are like foaming at the month because they can't find their relatives and they're like all homeless and they're all the stuff from Katrina.

[01:57:16.880 --> 01:57:19.780]
And it was this big fat, dark, complex, their chocolate lady.

[01:57:20.940 --> 01:57:25.300]
Just care screaming and rightfully so I guess they can't find her mother or whatever the deal is.

[01:57:25.580 --> 01:57:30.720]
And the last time they saw her she was with them and now they spirited her away and they know nobody cares.

[01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:34.220]
And she had a mustache who would make Hitler's pale and a win significance.

[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:34.520]
Really?

[01:57:35.060 --> 01:57:37.780]
I'm not talking about like a little facial hair like some ladies have.

[01:57:37.880 --> 01:57:39.020]
It's like a hormonal thing.

[01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:40.000]
No, she had a mustache.

[01:57:40.640 --> 01:57:42.720]
No, was it like Charlie Chaplin and Hitler?

[01:57:42.820 --> 01:57:44.040]
No, it was more like your father's mustache.

[01:57:44.500 --> 01:57:45.180]
Like Bulford Brimley?

[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:47.400]
No, not that bushy.

[01:57:48.700 --> 01:57:51.820]
No, more like a, I'm trying to say Edward G. Robinson.

[01:57:52.040 --> 01:57:53.620]
Oh, hey, styling.

[01:57:54.060 --> 01:57:54.220]
Yeah.

[01:57:55.200 --> 01:57:57.440]
Man, I'm giving New England to the term hair lip.

[01:57:58.480 --> 01:57:58.920]
Good.

[01:57:59.280 --> 01:57:59.500]
God.

[01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:00.920]
You haven't seen it?

[01:58:01.100 --> 01:58:01.780]
No, sorry.

[01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:03.540]
Oh, you just got to see that before you die.

[01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:07.040]
There's nothing you need to, I mean, I don't want to be in like, like we discussed yesterday.

[01:58:07.340 --> 01:58:11.100]
It's possible that with Kitchie and everything, maybe she didn't have time to do all her hygiene, you know.

[01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:12.340]
Maybe somebody stole her brick.

[01:58:12.940 --> 01:58:13.280]
I don't know.

[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:16.980]
But wouldn't you think that that would be, I just don't get it.

[01:58:17.060 --> 01:58:19.700]
Are you familiar with women with mustaches, for example?

[01:58:20.060 --> 01:58:22.140]
Like old women sometimes they'll get a whiskers.

[01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:23.500]
No, no, a mustache.

[01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:25.060]
Not whiskers, a mustache.

[01:58:25.400 --> 01:58:25.800]
Oh, man.

[01:58:26.220 --> 01:58:26.440]
Sorry.

[01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:28.720]
You remember the mustache peets?

[01:58:29.020 --> 01:58:29.340]
No.

[01:58:29.460 --> 01:58:33.400]
Anyway, speaking of that, a federal court judge ruled that two city ordinances that govern New

[01:58:33.400 --> 01:58:38.380]
that all entertainment clubs in Daytona Beach are unconstitutional because the city failed

[01:58:38.380 --> 01:58:41.180]
to prove that serving alcohol to clubs cause an increase in crime and violence.

[01:58:41.460 --> 01:58:42.200]
Good for you Orlando.

[01:58:42.520 --> 01:58:43.760]
It's about time they were going to come back.

[01:58:44.060 --> 01:58:45.100]
God, long overdue.

[01:58:45.600 --> 01:58:51.080]
The ruling stems from a 2002 suit by La Lalee Pop's Gentleman's Club arguing that the city regulations,

[01:58:51.100 --> 01:58:56.340]
which prohibit New that all clubs from serving booze, did not lead a US Supreme Court test for allowing free speech to be

[01:58:56.340 --> 01:58:56.680]
restricted.

[01:58:57.020 --> 01:58:57.700]
How do you like that?

[01:58:57.840 --> 01:58:58.220]
Yamama.

[01:58:58.580 --> 01:58:59.380]
So, Sox and Hell.

[01:58:59.980 --> 01:59:06.020]
The high court said several criteria that can be used to restrict public nudity, including restrictions that further a substantial government interest.

[01:59:06.600 --> 01:59:09.240]
The trial centered on if they turned this ordinance's method standard.

[01:59:10.060 --> 01:59:14.600]
Friday's ruling was the latest cell phone along running battle between Orlando and several adult entertainment launches.

[01:59:15.080 --> 01:59:22.100]
City officials have long wanted to clean up the town's image by restricting nude dancing to certain parts of the city and burying booze from being served there.

[01:59:22.940 --> 01:59:23.660]
Oh, brother.

[01:59:23.900 --> 01:59:25.120]
So tired of that crap.

[01:59:25.120 --> 01:59:28.960]
La Lalee Pop's is on grand view avenue and features topos dances in G-string.

[01:59:29.120 --> 01:59:29.560]
Oh, right.

[01:59:30.280 --> 01:59:37.080]
This is a clear, resounding and unbelievable un-believeable win for us at Brett Hartley in attorney representing La Lalee Pop's.

[01:59:37.280 --> 01:59:41.640]
There's a difference between saying we don't like strip clubs and we don't want them and saying we don't want them because they cause crimes.

[01:59:42.060 --> 01:59:43.640]
The latter is acceptable. The former is not.

[01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:52.220]
In issuing his ruling Friday, US District Judge John Antoon, the second wrote that recent court rulings have raised the bar for municipalities and proving that nude clubs lead the crime.

[01:59:52.220 --> 02:00:01.180]
He agreed with the clubs attorney and wrote that the city's laws are, but you see, it's like a self-fulfilling prophecy because as you know what they do is they zone in cities.

[02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:12.320]
They zone certain parts of cities for this kind of a for adult entertainment and they always pick the smarmyist, the nice, kind of like the red light district in Boston, the same thing, the combat zone.

[02:00:12.620 --> 02:00:14.960]
What I call the combat zone for real reason, you know.

[02:00:15.520 --> 02:00:21.060]
So they always put in there and say, oh, look at all the crime it's bringing and all the smarmy people or the other stuff like that.

[02:00:21.220 --> 02:00:23.500]
It's America for you, baby.

[02:00:24.760 --> 02:00:27.100]
I remember when America used to be kind of an enjoyable place.

[02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:33.600]
I was trying to think when that QAM used to be an enjoyable place, but I guess my memories getting short in my old age.

[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:38.320]
How's that pool coming to you asked? Well, this is sure a long show today. My God, not even one o'clock yet.

[02:00:39.580 --> 02:00:48.640]
Actually, I need to come up for oxygen today. The most incredible thing you've ever seen on TV is this pretty good list of stuff and it goes right in with that American pie thing we played 908 votes.

[02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:55.900]
We're going to make a thousand like falling off a rock, you know, like falling off the edge of a cliff like Roger Thorpe 908. That's the kind of great.

[02:00:56.180 --> 02:01:00.980]
And you know something I got tomorrow's poll will start on next hour. How's that? Well, we can't start unless we, huh?

[02:01:00.980 --> 02:01:05.420]
We did this yesterday that now how do we do that? Josh typed it up and sent it to Eric.

[02:01:06.140 --> 02:01:13.320]
Yeah, thanks again. Huh? Yeah. And thanks again to Sean for sending us a few and for the keep working on it. Sean, don't don't stop now.

[02:01:13.740 --> 02:01:18.420]
You want to know tomorrow's poll before we today's? Okay. How about one for a week from Wednesday? That'd be better.

[02:01:18.740 --> 02:01:27.040]
Here's tomorrow's whose enthusiasm is most annoying? And here's the realist I got now. See Sean said aside from religious note.

[02:01:27.040 --> 02:01:34.840]
Well, why aside from religious note? Exactly. Why exempt them? The God squad. You got the your Mormons and your Christian.

[02:01:35.020 --> 02:01:40.300]
Who the ones that comes to your home as witnesses with a watch tower and aboard again Christians and all the other Getzke's on the street corners.

[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:49.020]
So lump them all in there. The religious nuts. Sure. A sort of a sort of nuts. Freckies. All right. Recovery alcoholics like used to work at Paxon there. Right.

[02:01:49.020 --> 02:01:59.580]
PC gamers. Political junkies. God's people. I'll leave that for you. All right. And I added in commercial hosts. Okay. You know what I'm saying? I do.

[02:01:59.960 --> 02:02:07.160]
Hey, this is the greatest piece of cake in there. All like just bubbling over them out. Foming including that one cross eyed bits that's on or half the time with the Juicy Man.

[02:02:07.540 --> 02:02:10.180]
And by the way, spirit of the Juicy Man, Jack Lillane just turned 110.

[02:02:10.180 --> 02:02:15.800]
This is the new Rogers. This is 516.

[02:02:17.180 --> 02:02:19.900]
The Ron Ron radio network.

[02:02:40.180 --> 02:02:46.060]
I don't know what I can tell anyone. What is it? Maybe a little way.

[02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:50.120]
I don't know.

[02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:25.580]
Oh my God.

[02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:34.500]
Some 47 over here. We got guilty Thursday and Friday. Any interest? No. It'll be a two to four. It's got the mixing match hour two to four.

[02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:41.920]
Now did you facet that thing there? Because I tried facet him in the pool and his line was busy. So I'm assuming you were facet him or something? No, I was not. Well shame on him then.

[02:03:42.520 --> 02:03:48.700]
So how are we going to do this then? Keep trying or you could back to it to me and I'll make sure that he gets it. Yeah. Just like that paycheck.

[02:03:48.700 --> 02:03:53.160]
Okay, I'll facet you right now. Okay. Just like that time sheet.

[02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:13.300]
Okay, you got the starter list coming at you. All right. Wait until you hear this. You're going to fall on the floor. Are you sure?

[02:04:13.300 --> 02:04:18.880]
Phil, you hear that the faxing sound in the back and then the person I love that. Oh yeah, this one. These these factors.

[02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:24.880]
Phil Henry's new TV show set to debut. I heard a rumor about that. Well, there you go.

[02:04:25.580 --> 02:04:33.620]
Premier Radio Network's man of a thousand voices will appear as a cynical history teacher named Dick Green on the new NBC TV ensemble comedy teachers.

[02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:40.380]
The show will bow a pro six and the 9 30 PM time slot immediately following this season's breakout comedy hit. My name is oil.

[02:04:40.380 --> 02:04:48.700]
The executive producers of teachers are Matt Tarsie's in build rule. Only creative forces behind recent primed on TV hits scrubs and will engrave gay.

[02:04:49.280 --> 02:04:55.180]
Henry will continue to host his nightly syndicate a radio show for premier, which currently is on a reported 100 plus stations nationwide.

[02:04:55.860 --> 02:05:00.560]
Okay, there you go. Your old buddy Phil Henry. Remember when he used to be good.

[02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:06.680]
There's a say when he used to be a good guy, which we find out pretty early on he was never a good guy, but he used to be good, but not no more.

[02:05:06.900 --> 02:05:12.500]
But he's going to be a big hit on TV, man. You're just jealous. Yeah, I'm not jealous. I just want to get paid. That's all that's all I want.

[02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:19.340]
Seth, is that too much to ask? Who's enthusiasm is most annoying? How about sports fans?

[02:05:19.800 --> 02:05:23.780]
Oh, huh? I'm pulling it right back out of the fax machine. Please.

[02:05:25.480 --> 02:05:37.720]
Yeah, you know the ones I'm talking about that we're all the paraphernalia. It's one thing the way to paraphernalia like ballgame or hockey game, but it's nothing to walk around like an overgrown child like our program director with a cane's cap and the outfit.

[02:05:37.920 --> 02:05:47.260]
Oh, geez. Like they don't want to be dolphin, denier or something. Or do you are Keynes? What that was the Keynes mascot? I should know because I'm going to like the story. No. The other one.

[02:05:47.260 --> 02:06:01.200]
It's a baseball mascot. I just don't I miss the way I am. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. You know who's enthusiasm is way to annoy him? Who's that Richard Simmons? Oh, God.

[02:06:01.660 --> 02:06:11.560]
It was in or rip Taylor. You remember him, don't you? Yeah, but it's neat. I you know, you might have died. I sure hope so. He was he was gay. So you might have died. You know, and also.

[02:06:12.280 --> 02:06:19.700]
Yeah, I'm living straight. You might have died too. You know, that's where it goes. I have to say yeah, everybody died. Feel it. Okay. I might have been gay. So we might have died.

[02:06:20.200 --> 02:06:20.440]
Yeah.

[02:06:22.940 --> 02:06:36.260]
Pathetic 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60. They've arrived in Paul in was gay. He's dead. Raymond Burr was gay. He's dead. John Wayne was a real straight arrow. He's dead. I beg your pardon. No, he was gay. Oh, are you starting in again?

[02:06:36.920 --> 02:06:42.260]
Just leave him alone already. Will you please? I mean the bits are enough. You're going to start again with a moment. Huh? Maybe.

[02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:55.160]
Whatever you want. W. A. K. Y. M. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Hey, Neil. For today's poll, do you have the Beatles first appearance on Ed Sullivan in February of 64? No, I've been there.

[02:06:57.220 --> 02:07:06.220]
70 million people watch that. I'll be there. That's scary in it. But I really make sure. Yeah. Now at our stage. Okay. Thanks, pal. You're a little bit late to start adding on to these.

[02:07:06.220 --> 02:07:21.180]
But we shouldn't have that on here. Right. Dr. Proport. I seen it. I seen the Beatles. And it wasn't the Beatles. It was the Beatles. So we had Sullivan said it's Solomon. The Beatles. Here are stayed. He. I mean, you got to head to a man. It was a guy with no talent. He was like a writer.

[02:07:21.180 --> 02:07:33.020]
A newspaper writer in New York. You're sure. Show was with a bigger part. No neck. No, wasn't the show shows. That was a teaser was the toast of the town. Wasn't that it? Yes, he is. The Ed Solomon show.

[02:07:33.020 --> 02:07:42.260]
Wait 30 seconds. Pokebranel. And then senior Wences was on there too. Sorry. And the hand Elvis. Of course that we only photograph him from the hips up.

[02:07:42.840 --> 02:07:49.680]
You may find that most amusing nowadays, but happens to be true. Elvis is first. He was a hipster. He was a hipster like somebody else.

[02:07:49.840 --> 02:08:00.980]
Don't go. Not quite that hip. So the thing that he. WQ I am. Hello. Hey, Neil. How you doing, pal? Okay, sir. Hey, you guys were all mustache intensive. Last segment. Huh? Yeah.

[02:08:00.980 --> 02:08:10.320]
Now with with the girl from New Orleans, Hitler and all that's a poll. There's a mustache. We've done that. Have you done that the best mustache or the most.

[02:08:10.700 --> 02:08:20.260]
How about the most unusual mustache? Well, you could do that. We've got Hitler. You got Stalin. You got Frank Vapa. You got a lot of media and head like the long. Oh, Jesus. He years away.

[02:08:20.260 --> 02:08:32.380]
I'm not old enough to remember that had that big long curly Q mustache. Oh, God. Sniper with lash must less something like that. That's what I'm talking about. Yeah, that kind. Hey, pal, I have a great day. You two.

[02:08:33.580 --> 02:08:42.020]
Who Peter Ren. No, Kenan wind. I'm just asking. No, I'm talking about a long, long, long time ago. Had a Kenan wind and had that kind of. But that's a good.

I like that. Thanks, pal. You're father. Your mama's mustache. Right. Right. How about those mustache peets? Pizza. Oh, for me.

[02:08:53.280 --> 02:09:11.400]
Who the hell was the hurricane's mascot? It's a guy used to be at South Carolina. He was called cocky up there in South Carolina. And it's a college world series. I told her on Fraser. I said, we have to get that guy. John Ruth was his real name. Come on, Josh. What? He already told you that it's the eybist, the real mascot. I don't know. No, that's not what we're talking about.

[02:09:11.800 --> 02:09:19.500]
I don't know what you're talking about. Geez. You better start hanging out with the other Josh more often. Hurricane intensive. You better know your cane.

[02:09:19.620 --> 02:09:39.280]
To be a Mr. Because you sure don't. Well, that is their mascot right now. Well, the one that used to be the mascot was he finally probably outgrew it unlike J. Roqueach and unlike Mike Rosenthal. And unlike your program director. He probably outgrew it and wanted to grow up and go into the real world. You know, was it a pelican? There was not a pelican. It was like a. I don't know what he was. Forget about it.

[02:09:39.680 --> 02:09:56.080]
That's what happens when you get old and feeble. Somebody Q. I. N. Hello, I was at a dodo. There was a dodo bird Q. I. N. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. You know that Anna Benson bitch you were talking about yesterday. Yes. Her husband was the one that was a ragged on my four Michael Moore. Exactly.

Where husband got traded to the Baltimore Orioles. Good. Serve some right. The picture that got traded back to the Metz for him. Name is for Hay Julio. I'll be named.

[02:10:09.980 --> 02:10:24.380]
There. You got Julio's coming out of the broom closet, man. It's frightening. That's right. I just want you to find out funny. Thanks for the bad news. By the way, George was out sick yesterday. So we didn't know that the oldest station of the state of Oklahoma, the oldest AM station just went.

[02:10:24.380 --> 02:10:54.260]
Thank you. But a sound of casting the right family. Spaniard. By the way, I was a little sick in English. That's amazing. Oklahoma City. That's was all in illegal of beeners are coming up across the border. And of course, Texas can't hold all of them. So they shut up in Oklahoma. Just follow the fires. Those are those mushy beaters to by the way. Right. Just follow them fires like early fires and late fires. Somebody Q. I. M. Hello. Yes, Neil. Yes, sir. Yeah, I just got a little bit of interesting trivia for you. Okay. Okay. Kobe Bryant scored 81 points.

[02:10:54.260 --> 02:11:24.240]
I was against the Raptors. I seen it. It was 666 game. Wow. That's not the weird part though. The weird part is it was as 150th without a rape charge. Excellent. Nice going. Oh, only the Raptors could give up 81 points to one guy. That's beautiful. Yeah. No, we're supposed to admire Kobe. He's a really great up. So we don't care if he's a slime ball and maybe occasionally he, you know, he asked to add up that whatever can't say it. Sorry, Joyce. That was funny. Anything anymore. No, I think it's a lot of fun. I think it's a lot of fun. I think it's a lot of fun. I think it's a lot of fun. I think it's a lot of fun. I think it's a lot of fun. I think it's a lot of fun.

One of these days we're all going to explode. Stop and me. So at least at the very least, just pay us on your idiots over there in a way. Just pay us. Stop any excuses. Stop any stall installment plan. Just write the freaking check. This is the new world.

last November I say aunt we immediately made plans to stay for St. Louis for

[02:15:20.360 --> 02:15:23.860]
the funeral we drove the 700 miles to St. Louis I'm not allowed to fly an airplane

[02:15:23.860 --> 02:15:26.960]
within the U.S. because the Department of Homeland Security and the TSA

[02:15:26.960 --> 02:15:31.480]
consider me a threat to the security of the U.S.A. Yep I'm on the official no fly

[02:15:31.480 --> 02:15:34.900]
list along with some 80 thousand other Americans most people don't wear in

[02:15:34.900 --> 02:15:38.100]
their own list until they get to the airport the temperature boarding pass I'm

[02:15:38.100 --> 02:15:41.340]
lucky a long time friend who works for an airline took me several months ago that

[02:15:41.340 --> 02:15:44.980]
I'm on the list so I don't even bother trying to fly those who don't know in advance

[02:15:44.980 --> 02:15:47.780]
are allowed to buy an airline ticket and often make the long track to the

[02:15:47.780 --> 02:15:50.720]
airport only to be told that they're not allowed to board a plane and must

[02:15:50.720 --> 02:15:54.480]
call an 800 number to see if they can be cleared to board the plane some are some

[02:15:54.480 --> 02:15:57.760]
aren't but the process takes so much time that many who are cleared end up

[02:15:57.760 --> 02:16:01.640]
missing their flight anyway and no enemy of Uncle Sam we've got a lot of

[02:16:01.640 --> 02:16:05.600]
co-conspirators U.S. Senator Edward Kennedy uh representative John Lewis

[02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:08.980]
Democratic Georgia even actor David Nelson from the Adventures of Ozzie and

[02:16:08.980 --> 02:16:11.900]
Harriet each found themselves having to prove they're not terrorists before

[02:16:11.900 --> 02:16:15.460]
getting on a plane but my favorite partner in crime is Edward Allen of Houston

[02:16:15.460 --> 02:16:20.460]
Texas Edward is a really dangerous man or a boy anyway Edward is four years old

[02:16:20.460 --> 02:16:23.320]
and we stopped along with his mother when they tried to board a plane over the

[02:16:23.320 --> 02:16:26.480]
holidays you guessed little Eddie is on the list another threat to the

[02:16:26.480 --> 02:16:30.320]
peace and security of the good old USA is this a joke Eddie's mom told

[02:16:30.320 --> 02:16:33.700]
continental airlines agent as out of all places bush intercontinental airport

[02:16:33.700 --> 02:16:37.300]
you can tell he's not a terrorist but continental agents weren't laughing and

[02:16:37.300 --> 02:16:40.060]
told young Eddie who would have to be cleared by the TSA before getting on the

[02:16:40.060 --> 02:16:43.060]
plane they allowed him to fly but he and his mom went through the same process

[02:16:43.060 --> 02:16:46.220]
when they tried to fly back home to Houston I know the government tried to

[02:16:46.220 --> 02:16:49.200]
protect because of the terrorist attacks but common sense should play a role in

[02:16:49.200 --> 02:16:52.240]
him as Allen said I don't think he's going through the trouble of being harassed

through he had to make multiple phone calls to get his name off the list so did

[02:16:59.240 --> 02:17:03.120]
Congressman Lewis of Georgia it takes a powerful U.S. Senator that much trouble

[02:17:03.120 --> 02:17:07.240]
to get off the list an ordinary person is dooms as John Soma a professor of

[02:17:07.240 --> 02:17:10.480]
computer technology law University of Denver and executive director of the

[02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:13.860]
privacy foundation there we still don't have a mechanism to ensure that the

[02:17:13.860 --> 02:17:17.020]
government's no-fly list is accurate Soma said the only way you can get your

[02:17:17.020 --> 02:17:20.420]
name off is if your senator Kennedy he calls up somebody and says you're not

[02:17:20.420 --> 02:17:23.060]
going to get your money next year but what about the other two to eighty million

[02:17:23.060 --> 02:17:27.480]
Americans the TSA won't tell anybody why they're on the no-fly list they that

[02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:30.940]
they claim is classified yet the list seems to carry a lot of names of people

[02:17:30.940 --> 02:17:33.800]
whose only crime has been critical of the Bush administration or the war in

[02:17:33.800 --> 02:17:37.020]

both last two elections were thickest and so they don't want to run the air

Hey

This is not

[02:44:44.610 --> 02:44:45.950]
2 gravy

[02:44:55.770 --> 02:45:00.670]
146 with all the respect Sean I made him say I think this pool sucks. I'm sorry. Well

[02:45:00.670 --> 02:45:03.690]
what do you do now? Oh, what do you mean what I'm going to do now? I'm going to leave

[02:45:03.690 --> 02:45:08.510]
it up there. Maybe they'll last Johnwood during my, huh? Good plan. And maybe not. And

[02:45:08.510 --> 02:45:12.970]
you know what? Yamama, who cares? Wait till you hear this and this ties right in with

[02:45:12.970 --> 02:45:16.230]
the other pool. Well, that's great. All they are connecting the dots stuff we've had

[02:45:16.230 --> 02:45:20.690]
today is in what's not and where's my damn paycheck? Bronco's fans as he was humiliated

[02:45:20.690 --> 02:45:25.210]
by teacher. See this thing about the sports fans we got under the sports nerds. We can't

[02:45:25.210 --> 02:45:28.670]
be surprised. It's only got five votes. That's because it's on this station. So that's

[02:45:28.670 --> 02:45:35.590]
right. You know that's true. Beaver falls. Pennsylvania. I mean, you know what I'm just

[02:45:35.590 --> 02:45:39.830]
barely going to make it today. Just barely going to eke out a show today. And I don't

[02:45:39.830 --> 02:45:43.210]
mean much of a show. So why should we ever get pulled out? Why waste a good pool on a day

[02:45:43.210 --> 02:45:47.910]
like this? Right? Right. Maybe if I get paid, I'll do a good show. Beaver falls, Pennsylvania.

[02:45:47.910 --> 02:45:51.670]
17-year-old high school student said he was humiliated when a teacher made him sit on

[02:45:51.670 --> 02:45:57.530]
the floor during a midterm exam in his ethnicity class for wearing a Denver Bronco's jersey.

[02:45:58.390 --> 02:46:04.610]
All right. The teacher, John Kelly, forced Joshua Van Ooi to sit on the floor. That's Van

[02:46:04.610 --> 02:46:09.710]
Ooi. Sit on the floor and take the test Friday. Two days before the Pittsburgh Stevers beat

[02:46:09.710 --> 02:46:15.390]
the Bronco's 34-17 in the FC Championship game. Kelly also made other students to

[02:46:15.390 --> 02:46:21.010]
crumple about paper at Van Ooi. Van Ooi. Who may call it a stinking Denver fan, Van Ooi,

[02:46:21.070 --> 02:46:29.170]
to the AP on Monday. Kelly said Van Ooi, a junior at Beaver area senior high school, just

[02:46:29.170 --> 02:46:33.190]
didn't get the joke. If he felt uncomfortable and that's a lesson, that's what the class

[02:46:33.190 --> 02:46:36.890]
he designed to do. Kelly told them that in the post, it was silly fun. I can't believe

[02:46:36.890 --> 02:46:41.490]
he was upset. He made him sit on the floor and let the other students throw crumple

[02:46:41.490 --> 02:46:45.410]
about paper at him. Van Ooi was wearing a number seven Bronco's jersey on Friday because

[02:46:45.410 --> 02:46:49.370]
he's a fan of John L. Way, the Bronco's retired hollow flamer quarterback. Van Ooi said

[02:46:49.370 --> 02:46:53.710]
he was so unnerved. He left at least 20 questions blank. I'm a 60 question test. He just

[02:46:53.710 --> 02:46:57.550]
wants out of Kelly's class because he's afraid the teacher won't treat him fairly now that

[02:46:57.550 --> 02:47:00.970]
the story reached the media. I'm going to have to deal with him for two to nine more

[02:47:00.970 --> 02:47:03.830]
weeks school quarters. Now he's going to want to revenge him out. Van Ooi said yesterday,

[02:47:04.030 --> 02:47:08.370]
I took the test. I'm shaking. I'm furious. I didn't know what to do. For this, for revenge,

[02:47:08.370 --> 02:47:14.290]
we need to go see Don Corleone. Kelly, who wore a Ben Rothless Berger jersey Friday and

[02:47:14.290 --> 02:47:18.450]
his principal Thomas Karazowski didn't immediately return messages left on a school voicemail

[02:47:18.450 --> 02:47:23.970]
yesterday. How do you like that? Teacher Jackass, man. Big B. Refall. See, the problem is

[02:47:23.970 --> 02:47:27.090]
with this teacher shooting. They always shoot the wrong teachers, you know, like they

[02:47:27.090 --> 02:47:31.690]
got to pump each other. He was a good guy. This teacher, but a baby, man, just time you're

[02:47:31.690 --> 02:47:36.770]
from Florida. It's the Florida F and Way. You messed with me and big B. Refall's area

[02:47:36.770 --> 02:47:40.450]
school district superintendent Donna Nugent says she was aware of the situation, but said

[02:47:40.450 --> 02:47:44.350]
confidentiality rules prevent her from committing specifically. We'll take whatever action we

[02:47:44.350 --> 02:47:49.570]
need in order for the students to feel comfortable. Nugent said, right, comfortable. My ass.

[02:47:49.990 --> 02:47:54.990]
Is that a joke or what? You know, comfortable. My ass, all these people that, in fact,

[02:47:54.990 --> 02:47:59.790]
when you watch them, we'll be primal fear. This will strike a court. All right. No, that's

[02:47:59.790 --> 02:48:04.170]
not the one. I'm sorry. That will not strike a court. The one will strike court as sleepers

[02:48:04.170 --> 02:48:08.170]
with Kevin Bacon. What a cast, man. Kevin Bacon, I'll give you like a little background.

[02:48:08.330 --> 02:48:13.610]
I won't spoil it for you. Kevin Bacon, Dustin Hoffman plays the attorney, Brad Pitt. That's

[02:48:13.610 --> 02:48:17.490]
the one that we decided that we did see. Yeah, but I never saw from the beginning. Right.

[02:48:17.770 --> 02:48:21.130]
Until the weekend. I watched it all watching that right from the beginning. I saw it. It

[02:48:21.130 --> 02:48:25.850]
was all right. It was all right. There's all right. How's Kevin Bacon doing? I want to see

[02:48:25.850 --> 02:48:30.330]
an animal. How's Kevin Bacon? What? And then and the most interesting, well, maybe not

[02:48:30.330 --> 02:48:33.750]
the most interesting, but part of it that's kind of interesting is that the author of the

[02:48:33.750 --> 02:48:37.650]
book it was based on said it was a true story. And the New York State Department of Corrections

[02:48:37.650 --> 02:48:42.810]
is there was never any such juvenile justice system or our institution where that kind

[02:48:42.810 --> 02:48:47.130]
of thing went on. We have no documentation. And the author says only the names have been

[02:48:47.130 --> 02:48:51.710]
changed to protect the gildy, obviously. And that's it. He stands by the story. And then

[02:48:51.710 --> 02:48:55.590]
they put that stuff all up at the end of the movie and sleepers. Yeah. It was only good.

[02:48:56.030 --> 02:49:00.290]
It was a long time ago. I thought it was just fine. Trust me. I thought it was time

[02:49:00.290 --> 02:49:03.970]
you to hear that. When you go to watch Primal Fear and I try to get it in tonight, although

[02:49:03.970 --> 02:49:08.170]
you know, big night tonight, you got that show that you just discovered. You want to

[02:49:08.170 --> 02:49:15.290]
sample once it calls superstitious supernatural. And then of course there's the shield at

[02:49:15.290 --> 02:49:21.070]
10 o'clock, which is the shield. Shield my ass. All right. Please save the whole humanity.

[02:49:21.450 --> 02:49:25.610]
Please. The shield is great. Is it really? What's that about? Oh, you even hyping that

[02:49:25.610 --> 02:49:29.350]
thing for ever since it came out of the channel. It's everyone's favorite. Well, it's

[02:49:29.350 --> 02:49:34.490]
technically a cop show, but it's not. It just takes place at a cop show. No, it's not

[02:49:34.490 --> 02:49:39.350]
what you're cop show that George light. No, no, no, it's not a cop show. It just has cops

[02:49:39.350 --> 02:49:43.370]
in it. How's that? Okay. It's a soap opera. Oh, it isn't. It plays a cop buddy show at

[02:49:43.370 --> 02:49:49.070]
a body. It's nothing like the hero is a guy to me. The hero is a scummy murdering cop.

[02:49:49.510 --> 02:49:54.710]
No. So Bob, Rob, the take place at a cop show. A 49 year old flying student from Denver walked

[02:49:54.710 --> 02:49:59.010]
away from a crash on harm today in Lantana. After airplanes flipped over during a touching

[02:49:59.010 --> 02:50:02.790]
