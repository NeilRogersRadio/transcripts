[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740]
For three or radio is one that you've already made!

[00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:06.680]
That's a good one!

[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:08.420]
Ah!

[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.060]
You're insane!

[00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:19.700]
And hope does your heart say you're a big hit

[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.620]
And a boy who will achieve your life to come to the tree

[00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.360]
With heaven with the Judgment for these three

[00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.340]
Three years to leave

[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.580]
Don't care so we wonder why the hell are the earth

[00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.100]
With those hands and hands we are

[00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.120]
You're fair!

[00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.340]
He said they'd cease by the dawn

[00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.160]
What's wrong?

[00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.560]
Neobahn's true, you're over here

[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.260]
Let your spare hair be born

[00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.920]
Welcome for your insane

[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.300]
And say that's the best for a lesson

[00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.360]
You'll all say

[00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.380]
In your sight, you'll see that

[00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.180]
It's you, but you're a man of death

[00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.700]
For mother's grief, with hands

[00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.700]
Besides up in the desert

[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.000]
You'll see that's the best for a lesson

[00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.780]
You're insane!

[00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.860]
You're insane!

[00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.200]
Huh?

[00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.760]
Shoot me, you fuck too wall!

[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.760]
What?

[00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.820]
Oh no, 10 or 3 at 5, 60, WQA and Boyd, sure was interesting here in Tony's cigarette oil

[00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.520]
And his old voice this morning, wasn't it?

[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.100]
Huh?

[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.220]
Sounds very old

[00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.660]
And then I'm sure in that list of all the people he was thanking, he mentioned Iroh Windbag again

[00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:52.540]
Hey, am I wrong?

[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.920]
Joshua was that business all over?

[00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.080]
I thought they wanted a championship

[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.000]
Yeah, they did, man

[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.060]
What else he's still doing on the air for Christ's sake?

[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.640]
Well, they're going to talk about that till the season starts again

[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.720]
Till the cows come home?

[00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:03.200]
That's right

[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.760]
Jesus Christ, man, get that Iroh Windbag off our station

[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.200]
Don't you understand? He's like a noose around our neck

[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.180]
I once worked on a station called WNews

[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.020]
Anyway, wait until you hear this

[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.880]
Because Eric screwed up real bad, Eric wants to apologize right off the bat

[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.440]
Because I faxed in the pool again 400 times yesterday

[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.700]
And finally, around 8.30 last night, he finally decided to get his fat ass in in gear

[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.220]
And get back from the parliament house and he put the pool up, but you couldn't hold on it

[00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.460]
You could see it, it's an oldie but goodie and of course we're going to add like a million names to it

[00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.460]
But you couldn't hold on it

[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.960]
Now I could have called him in home, but I didn't want to go through that hole

[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.420]
I don't know

[00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.200]
In the summertime especially, you just don't want to call somebody home and bugging them off stuff like this

[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.980]
Would you call him?

[00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.460]
Yeah

[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.500]
I wouldn't, I don't want to hear

[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.480]
Whoa! That sound, he gets very upset

[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.960]
At any rate, so the pool didn't get on until 8.30 this morning

[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.720]
So we don't have our usual fantastic number

[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.040]
So we haven't got any chance to get a thousand during the show today

[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.920]
And that's Eric's fault, nice going Eric

[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.520]
But the one thing that may save us is that there's a zidia name to add on there

[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.180]
To this pool about people who died affecting you the most

[00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.180]
For example, see I'm doing things a little bit out of order today

[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.000]
That's because I want to get this kick at old style

[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.960]
Because just 2005 and 2006, because we did a poll last about two, three years ago probably I would say I would guesstimate

[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.560]
Okay

[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.180]
Well let's see, 2006 already is only June 29

[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.520]
Louis Rookhizer died

[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.220]
And John Camp Galbraith, we're not putting them on there

[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.820]
Casper Weinberg died, Ole Cassini died

[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.700]
Slabio Milosevic died, well a boom boom jeffery on died

[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.860]
We're not putting any of them

[00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.800]
Kirby Puckett, do we want to put him on there?

[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.220]
Kirby Puckett

[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.240]
Josh, it's up to you

[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.720]
No

[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.020]
Darren McGavin, there's one for George

[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.880]
They'll check the night stalker

[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.020]
He died February 25, the age of 83

[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.520]
Ain't stalking the streets of Chicago, no more looking for all the supernatural or hibi jubis

[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.600]
Yeah, I'm still bereaved

[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.920]
No, we don't want to put him on there

[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.720]
Dennis Weaver though, do we want to put him on?

[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.020]
He was in McLeod and he was also in a great movie called...

[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:56.680]
What was it called?

[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.660]
Oh, I know it

[00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.380]
When the trucker was chasing him

[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.840]
Uh-huh

[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.100]
Dual, that's it

[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.880]
Good job

[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.500]
That was his Steven Spielberg movie

[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.360]
Yes, it was

[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.320]
I think that was his first known movie

[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.220]
Dual, that was his...

[00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.000]
Dennis Weaver, let's get him on there

[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.060]
Don Nots died, who kind of reminds me a little of Suds Coleman

[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.220]
Suds is still alive, but you never know from that picture you put on there

[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.220]
Where he looks really old in there

[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.220]
He looks almost as old as Tony Siguero sounds

[00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.080]
At least I don't sound old anyway, you know?

[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.380]
I am, I'm very old

[00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.320]
But I don't sound...

[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.100]
Do I do I sound old?

[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.340]
No, you don't sound old

[00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.120]
Well that's right

[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.380]
What a bastard man

[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.500]
You are brutal

[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.260]
Don Nots, you got it?

[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.180]
You got it

[00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.080]
Well I don't want to go through this hole, I mean, I don't want to kill the first half

[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.840]
I want to show it, but just put more names on it, pull it away, I haven't even got to...

[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.960]
Your pull result from yesterday

[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.260]
And you did work yesterday by the way, I did

[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.800]
By the way, is anybody nowhere to ride Stratford in?

[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.980]
We have a law sales hole at QAM

[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.920]
I just want Steve Wolf to know that I'm on top of this situation, getting your spot on here

[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.100]
Because Trest's record is like, uh...

[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.200]
A wall, he is nowhere to be found, he's not answering his cell phone, he's not in a building

[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.800]
Maybe he's like out there with Fatboy looking for a new job

[00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.620]
You think?

[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.780]
Don Nots

[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.080]
What about Kurt Gaudy?

[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.600]
Who?

[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.460]
Great sportscaster, he died in February 20th, age of 86?

[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.280]
Kurt Gaudy

[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.440]
Come on, even you know who Kurt Gaudy was

[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.840]
Who?

[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.060]
Put him on there

[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.240]
That's somebody that Josh probably knows how to spell

[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.300]
Let's see you RT

[00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.160]
Peter Venturi died, he was in the author of JAWS

[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.080]
Don't put him on there though

[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.720]
No way, he nobody cares about Peter Venturi, are you crazy?

[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.380]
What about Betty Friedan?

[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.000]
I mean, she was a great defeminist, no don't put him on

[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.520]
Al Lewis, let's put Al Lewis on there for all the Howard Stern people

[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.260]
and all the monster people

[00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.140]
That was Grandpa

[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.040]
Yes it was

[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.520]
He had a wife, you know, did he?

[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.240]
I didn't know that

[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.020]
Al Lewis

[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.360]
Well, it was for show

[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.520]
Coretta Scott King was about to put here on there for the dark folks

[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.780]
What?

[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.460]
Are you sure?

[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.080]
Coretta Scott King

[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.320]
She died January 31st, she was 78th, Al Lewis died February 31st, 1882

[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.600]
February 31st was a bad month for dying famous people

[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.600]
Chris Penn, I don't remember if we even talked about that

[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.040]
Wasn't he Sean Penn's younger brother?

[00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:56.020]
That's right

[00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.220]
He was known in reservoir dogs, which sure you keep telling me don't watch it

[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.540]
Don't buy it, don't see it

[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.460]
But what did you put the age of 40?

[00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.420]
Must have been a drug thing, I think he was only 40

[00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.160]
I think it was

[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.320]
Tony Fransiosa, he was in the name of the game, the series

[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.660]
He was a very fay actor, I don't know

[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.660]
He died January 19th of the age of 77

[00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.060]
I didn't ever like him, he was very feminine

[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.520]
I'm not saying he was like gay, that

[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.380]
You know who that was, Tony Fransiosa?

[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.080]
Shelley Winners, let's put her on there

[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.460]
Are you out here Josh?

[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:25.400]
He's getting it

[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:25.820]
Yeah I got it

[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.200]
Shelley Winners, we miss her right?

[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.420]
Oh come on, just because she was fat is that what you're going to start in now?

[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.580]
No, because she was old and she was in those old movies

[00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.640]
January 14th, 1885

[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.960]
No, she was in one good movie, I can't think of what a one

[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.800]
It was a sighted adventure

[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.600]
No, and she wasn't very good enough

[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.720]
Lou Rawls, the day of January 6th, 1872

[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.300]
I'm just leaving this open for you to consider

[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.460]
Now those are just the 2006 ones

[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.360]
Wait till we get to 2005

[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.340]
But before that, let's...

[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.740]
Oh we got some trends, we got two-thirds of the pretty important stuff

[00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.180]
No, no, we're not getting to that yet, I'm holding that, that's the piece of resistance band

[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.620]
I'm holding that in the bands

[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.000]
And they really suck

[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.460]
By the way, I have a bulletin for the people of South Florida sports talk radio in South Florida is officially dead

[00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.340]
It's dead, finished, done

[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.160]
She died?

[00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:13.560]
By done, yeah

[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.540]
Thursday, June 29th, you can mark that down in the count

[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.220]
You can write it on your wrist like a memento

[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.340]
Well speaking of movies and memento and all of that

[00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.840]
I got... what are these people calling for now?

[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:24.200]
122AM, hello

[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:24.980]
One had names

[00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.240]
Oh, is that it? We're not doing that yet, QAM

[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:28.300]
Hello

[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:29.620]
No

[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.940]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.340]
Sound like somebody strangled them just before it could like blurt it out

[00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.140]
I'll be damned

[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.840]
Yeah, I wonder what this was, QAM greeting line, hello

[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.740]
Okay, like I said, I thought maybe it was like a real column, maybe it was something we didn't know about

[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.840]
Anyway, I'm going to give you an alert right now, moving that you want to be desperately assured of miss

[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.120]
And that's jury, that's with the G-E-R-R-Y

[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.020]
As a matter of fact, I think the Y

[00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:54.620]
Y

[00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:59.420]
It's the most important, but of course it's Gus Bansant, is the director, which you tell you a lot

[00:07:59.420 --> 00:07:59.840]
It does

[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.020]
For some reason, I'm looking

[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:06.100]
And if you go to IMDB and read the reviews, you know that most of the people that are doing the reviews are

[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.980]
Yeah, they're just all got the hops because Matt Dillen was in there

[00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.300]
I mean, Matt Damon

[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.120]
Matt Damon, and what's his name?

[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:18.820]
What's his name?

[00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:23.240]
And anybody could have done that rule, because all they did is like, trudging, I lost it in the desert, these two good buddies

[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.320]
And they're just trudging along and walking and walking and walking and trudging and walking

[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.480]
And what would he be going to do?

[00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.620]
Don't cry, don't cry if you're in there, they're walking

[00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:36.660]
And then finally in the end, Matt Damon falls on top of his buddy there, which I guess is in the first time

[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:43.420]
And he suffocates, and we're kind of like in Cooquewsness when the chief fell on Jack Nicholson there and with a pillow

[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:46.680]
Yeah, they have a pillow there in the desert, they also didn't have any food or water

[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:51.520]
But nevertheless, and he's smothered him because he figured it would be the easiest way to put him out of his misery

[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:55.100]
Because they were going to die in the desert and then lo and behold, like a couple minutes later

[00:08:55.100 --> 00:09:02.560]
Oh, there's the highway and it gets picked up by a truck or whatever, an SUV

[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.900]
And if he just wouldn't have suffocated for Casey there, he'd still be with us today

[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:11.440]
Nice going, Matt, you kind of like in the end of the movie you saw, tell the minister Ripley

[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.000]
Uh-huh

[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.900]
He's killing this man at Matt Damon, he's killing this, he's also got a wife now, about 80 kids

[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:17.700]
They don't know

[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.140]
Hop it amount like crazy Matt Damon, they ain't by buying it or not I don't believe it

[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:25.900]
12 minutes after 10, in fact the scene where he's on top of Casey F, like it doesn't look like a suffocation scene

[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.020]
It looks more like something out of broke ass mounting to me

[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:32.140]
And they have to tend like their legs intertwined there, there's an awful lot of stuff going on there

[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:37.440]
12 minutes after 10 at 560 WQM, if anybody knows where Troy Stratford is, please call the police

[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:42.480]
For years now I've been telling you about a fantastic place to have a great dining experience, not just a meal

[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.660]
You can have a meal anywhere, you can go to a diner and get a meal

[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.400]
I'm talking about the melting pot, it is sensational

[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.780]
If you haven't been there in a while, go back take the whole gang, brighten up your summer

[00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:55.200]
This is a full four-course dining experience, it starts out with a renowned cheese fondue

[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.840]
And they serve it to you with three different kinds of breads

[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.460]
We've granny Smith apples and crisp veggies, you dip them in, you dunk them in, you love them

[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.440]
Next comes your choice of lively salads

[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:08.120]
You aren't crazy include a combination of lobster, filet mignon, shrimp casings, sea accadiencees and chicken

[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:11.020]
Pork, duck, portabello mushrooms and lots more cooked in a well abroad

[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:16.280]
And don't forget of course the melting pots, homemade dipping sauces, that's what it's the key is, that's what it's all about

[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.540]
We make the fondue delicious and the experience is fun too

[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:26.340]
Here's the clincher, top it off with their famous chocolate fondue desserts with fresh strawberries, bananas, pineapple, cheesecake, brownies

[00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:30.060]
And tasting marshmallows, rolled in creche Oreos or graham crackers, whichever you like for dipping

[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:34.540]
Dip them, dunk them in, put a big smile on your face and your blood sugar will go up to at least 4,000

[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.820]
Only at the melting pot, stop by real soon and come to the old meal

[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:44.840]
Since your bio, you'll find a melting pot in Fort Lauderdale, Campbell, Buckebritone, Cooper City, Coral Springs and of course most prestigious North Miami Beach

[00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:51.160]
This is Neil Rogers, this is 516 QA

[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.940]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, Neil Rogers

[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.220]
You have a sweep up, the wet sand draws a subtle acting for rotating QAM staff

[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:05.260]
You, as a forehold, how would you like to join a Quack sales team?

[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:15.520]
Here is your chance to un-cash and enhance your gaze-cash informant by selling airtime for popular weightier personalities like Big O and Gaudi

[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:20.820]
Yes, imagine how easy it can be to sell sports in your face all the time

[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:25.840]
That's what we have at WQAM, believe it's an entertaining and lucrative format

[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.640]
Or at least me in some of the out of the list too

[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:36.100]
So come join our club, WQAM wants to cross-quest you and go a life that is with dreams of smuggling to sweaty men

[00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:39.580]
So don't get left in the shower, pull down your pants right now

[00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:46.100]
1017 at 560 WQAM, guess what we got at 2 o'clock? We got Evan Cohen on to the end of weekday, like right there in the middle of the week

[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.840]
We ruled him out between 2 and 4, Evan Cohen and his brother Marty

[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.360]
Then we got Curtis Stevenson for the 7-0 Mad Dog today, what's his story?

[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.600]
He just taken a day off today, good nice going baby

[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.780]
Then we got Lee Feldman, I guess that's Flea

[00:11:58.780 --> 00:11:59.660]
Is what you're telling me?

[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.880]
That's what I hear, Flea Eldman and Craig Misch, the old Mischmash between 7 and 10

[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.040]
And any K from Showgirls doing his show at 10 o'clock tonight

[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.960]
That's our bizarre line up for you

[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:15.340]
The world's leading industrialized democracy today called on Iran to respond next week to a UN proposal concerning its nuclear program

[00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:19.180]
They give him a deadline of July 5th, that was my mother's birthday, see that?

[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.080]
How about that killer?

[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:25.760]
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmabah, what about her name is Ahmadina Jodh, see it's not really that hard to say this guy

[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:26.660]
How about the physical kind of?

[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.120]
That's what I just said, Ahmadina Jodh, you are?

[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.080]
Said he didn't plan to be no you are

[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.080]
Said he didn't plan to respond to the UN proposal to the long-distance 22th

[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:41.120]
But to five permanent UN Security Council members in Germany are pressing to Iran to respond before the G-O-G-8 summit that starts July 15

[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:45.980]
We are disappointed in the absence of an official Iranian response to this positive proposal

[00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:53.520]
So the statement from G-A-4 minister is quoted by the AP with respect to your clear and substantive Iranian response to these proposals at a July 15 meeting

[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:59.400]
Between European Union's Foreign Minister and Iran's nuclear negotiator, otherwise but a bane like this like that

[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.980]
So it works, that's what we are acting like butchering like that but

[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.400]
The Bane, your bloated brains will over unicely release soon

[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.180]
That's the way you do it

[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:12.060]
You don't monkey around with all kinds of negotiation and have argue about the shape of the table

[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.240]
You give them a deadline, that's it

[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.340]
July 5th, if you don't get with it, get to eat with it

[00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:19.720]
The Bane, your bloated brains will over unicely release soon

[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:23.300]
That's the way to do it, that's my dinner job, then invite them to dinner

[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:28.180]
Okay, somebody said a pretty mercury for the pool, I would certainly go along with that, we got it, we got it

[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.700]
You guys Johnny Carson, here's Johnny, we got it

[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:35.800]
See a lot of these people died after we originally did this pool the first time which is good

[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:40.220]
And not good that they died necessarily but you see what I'm saying?

[00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:42.660]
Because it gives us a whole bunch of other dead people

[00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:45.320]
Because that just keeps going on and on my God

[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.720]
Every time you turn around somebody saying, I'm dying on my hands

[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.620]
Which website do you visit most often? That was our pool question yesterday

[00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:54.180]
By the way don't forget to go to myspace.com

[00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:58.060]
Myspace.com forward slash Neil God, N-I-E-L

[00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.700]
Right? Any I-L

[00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.680]
What do I say? N-I-E-L

[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.860]
I didn't say that, okay, back up, take me

[00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:11.880]
I don't want to hear it, all right, anyway, listen, I got a heavy schedule, I got a lot of pressure, I got to come back again next year

[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.040]
I know, come on, yeah

[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:19.000]
Now listen, you can click right under our thing and where the book says A-hole, I think it's appropriate

[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:23.720]
This is myspace.com and it takes you right to that thing and there's some really nifty pictures

[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.420]
Amazing how many females we got on there, you know when you look at these ratings

[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.780]
Yeah, always the same, we don't have any women

[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:31.960]
They just haven't got any calls, they have no women

[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:36.660]
But for some amazing reason every time we want people to send pictures or participate in one of these deals

[00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.040]
There's a bunch of women on there, there's some lazy shocking

[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:44.680]
Nice for you guys, and there's some ugly guys for me, I mean there's something for everyone

[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:47.880]
There's a little something for everybody, there might be some human people on there eventually

[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:53.200]
So just keep a hoppin on it, and if you send anything stuff rose on there, there won't be any chat room under into that

[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:58.560]
No, nothing we don't want any part of is all you desperate people who like just go out, just open a window and yell it out

[00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:59.180]
I have no line

[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.180]
We all know it anyway, but just go ahead, kill some good time for you

[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:06.020]
Which website do you visit most often, we had a thousand, seventeen votes on your poll from yesterday

[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:09.620]
So you've got a thousand votes, although not during the show, but maybe it was during the show

[00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:10.640]
No, no

[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:15.540]
I wasn't until 830 because that's when Eric finally put this other poll up there, I switched and I thought, okay, let's say

[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:19.040]
And I clicked on there and I tried to vote, and I thought boy, Eric screwed his deal up

[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:24.260]
Now I got up this morning, I came in here and I clicked and tried to vote, and I thought, Eric, you still screwed up, you fat tub

[00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.020]
And then you got him on the stick

[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:30.440]
Which website do you visit most often, and of course you flew away, like a broom that you picked up

[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:34.300]
Neoigers.com, 359 by far, look at that, aren't we proud of that?

[00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:37.100]
If just the rest of the world knew about that website, we'd have it made it

[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.320]
I still think it would have been a good idea, and you talked me out of it

[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:44.660]
I would have been just one bad day at Woodbuy, and I could have spent three-four grand bought it like a quarter-page ad in USA today

[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.080]
And just promoting our website

[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:51.140]
Can you imagine the hits we could have gotten on there, Eric might have made it up, might have gotten buying another salami sandwich

[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.200]
Right? Yeah, it would have been something

[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:58.660]
We could have had people listen to this show like outside of time, because if you look at these trends, man

[00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:02.180]
It's not even worth, it's not worth cranking up the trends anymore if you believe these numbers

[00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:05.120]
And you guys across the street, shut it off, man

[00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:07.260]
Remember that sound by the Beach Boys, shut it down?

[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:07.840]
Yeah

[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:12.120]
Shut it down, that should be the theme song across the street for the seven-hour-for-the-ticket

[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.720]
Shut it down, just save the juice

[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:19.520]
Nearogers.com-359, porn sites, 157 porn sites

[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.600]
Oh my god

[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.560]
I think that number is probably a little bit low

[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:30.960]
My Yahoo-121 news sites, 113, that's because we got the intellectuals and the pseudom intellectuals out there who really enjoy that movie, Jerry directed by Gus Bansan

[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.880]
Don't waste your time with that piece of theory

[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:36.800]
And don't try to tell me that I didn't understand it or I missed something or watched it again

[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:41.240]
No, that is just so ponderous, my god

[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:46.800]
And remember the scene in the last days, the Eric Cobain thing?

[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:47.440]
Yeah

[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.740]
Where they're showing the front of the house and the scene, it's intramidable, it seems like it goes on forever

[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:59.240]
That's right, well, that's the thing with Matt Damon and KCF like walking through the desert

[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:03.160]
They're just walking and walking and trudging and you hear the sounds of the steps all over

[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:07.440]
And it's interesting, I never knew that the sand made so much noise when it came out of the house

[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:14.720]
Yeah, and it just goes on and on and you think, you know, sooner or later they either gonna collapse or I'm gonna collapse or something's gonna happen

[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.400]
And it's just tragic

[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:20.900]
Anyway, news sites, 113, thank God for the intellectuals out there, people are really give a crap

[00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:27.040]
eBay 44, I hate this poll, 43, meetup.com 35, what about whatup.com?

[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:31.540]
Come and see this, myspace.com 34, hotmail 28

[00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:33.260]
Oh, come on, only 28

[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:34.140]
That's it

[00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.100]
Why is that?

[00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.900]
Because there's so many other alternatives

[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:40.120]
Google mail 25, oh don't be doing no Google mail

[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.760]
Did you tell me Google is the anti-christ?

[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:44.040]
No Google is good, just the toolbar is bad?

[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:45.000]
That's correct

[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.200]
There's nothing wrong with a Google toolbar, I like it, I use it, it's the best one

[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.120]
Sure as hell beats the Alexa toolbar

[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:55.080]
Wikipedia 13, you know, I'm gonna tell you something right now that really bust my balls and my ass

[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.840]
Do you know that I'm not listed on Wikipedia?

[00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.980]
You're not a person that ever did a talk show on radio

[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:04.600]
This again goes to the tremendous publicity machine I've got behind me between 2AM and Norma Kent

[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:05.760]
I'm not even on Wikipedia

[00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:10.480]
Everybody, I wouldn't be surprised if Leah Flea Feldman is on there

[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.260]
I'm on Wikipedia, not near Rogers

[00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.380]
Go and look it up, there's no such listing

[00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:17.880]
I'll take your word for it, but it's a work in progress with Wikipedia

[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.020]
So, I don't know

[00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:21.540]
Yeah, well get me on there, okay, say about any crappy stuff

[00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.720]
Google mail 25, youtube.com, that's you

[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.220]
Shube

[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:28.420]
.com17, Wikipedia 13, I don't use the internet 12

[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:29.440]
Well, Yamama

[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:32.580]
Amazon 9, ComedyCentral.com 3

[00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:35.420]
By the way, let me tell you about that daily show, or better not

[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:40.660]
Facebook.com2QAM.com, SoleMentate Dose, oh my god

[00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:42.540]
NMTV.com with our crowd

[00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:42.780]
Oh!

[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.900]
Why did you even bother putting that on there?

[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.680]
You think our crowd is watching NMTV?

[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.080]
No, we were just going over some names Josh through that out there

[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.040]
I know it's supposed to be very popular, but I guess not

[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.720]
It's very popular now with this crowd

[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.760]
We don't have any young punk center like 10-year-olds watching

[00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:00.760]
Listening, Googlin, dillin

[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.360]
Well, they may be dillin, but they're sure not dillin with our website

[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.500]
So mtb.com's got the big

[00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:05.840]
Oh!

[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.860]
I don't like that, we got Evan Cohen to this afternoon

[00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:10.960]
I might actually come in here and listen, I've never heard him before

[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.820]
I might sit here and listen for a little while, do you think?

[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:13.820]
Do you think that?

[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:14.220]
No

[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:14.680]
No

[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:15.760]
Flunny

[00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:18.700]
Come on!

[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.820]
Give me a little bit of slack, Roberta, give a little flack

[00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:26.120]
You are just, you're relentless and heartless, you're just a cold-hearted bastard

[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.220]
Just like me

[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:29.080]
We got 301 votes on the poll

[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.460]
We got a shot at what?

[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.160]
400 today?

[00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:32.620]
This is so deflating

[00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:34.460]
Usually when the show starts we got like 5, 600

[00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:36.300]
We got a real good head start on a way to 1000

[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:40.700]
And then because Eric was busy eating venos last night or whatever he was eating

[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:42.740]
We got nothing

[00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:45.000]
So we started from scratch, we're scratching it

[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.380]
So I feel kind of like you today, you know, because usually say you start to pull like

[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.540]
Into the show, like right before the show starts you

[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:54.940]
Yeah, well I don't do that, I always have it set up to the afternoon before

[00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:56.040]
I like you to head start

[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.200]
But Eric just screwed us up bad

[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.060]
Which public figure's death affected you the most?

[00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:03.820]
We got only 301 votes for writing a plethora of names

[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.840]
JFK93 got my vote and he's winning hands down

[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.440]
John Lennon 39

[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.660]
They'll earn a heart 20

[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.560]
I'm sorry, I just, I don't understand

[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.180]
He won the first time we did this few years ago, he won it by a mile

[00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:15.100]
They'll earn a heart

[00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:16.160]
Maybe you just croaked

[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.160]

He couldn't find it

[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:47.140]
Merrill Monroe won, Frank Sinatra won, John Wayne won for the Duke

[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:52.240]
None for Johnny Carson, Charlie Winnis, Corridor Scott King, Al Lewis, Grandpa, Kurt Gaudi, Dennis Weaver

[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:56.640]
Michael Landon, Joseph Ageo, Rock Hudson or Jackie Kennedy, O'Neil's

[00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:58.760]
That's just a start

[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.740]
You know the first time we did it, Paul, we had 2028 votes, it must have been a weekend poll

[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.360]
Yeah, we'll be lucky to get like 600 now

[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.160]
Thanks to Eric really letting us down

[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.920]
Nice going, Eric, you ruined my whole week

[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:09.820]
You believe that?

[00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:11.460]
Nope, I just wanted to feel bad

[00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:14.040]

This is Neil Rogers

[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.140]
This is 5.16 Q.A.

[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:32.400]
I have been together in the Eden's Lake or Molo

[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:38.280]
The following announcement cannot be reproduced or re-broadcast without the express written permission of the National Football League

[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:53.980]
Hello, and then Roslip Berrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

[00:22:53.980 --> 00:23:23.960]
So, where I'm riding the 800 pound motorcycle puts in 90 miles an hour, I don't need a helmet, because I'm... Man, man, I like putting... Alright! 27 before I'm at 560 WDQM DUS Supreme Court today ruled that the Bush administration did not have the legal authority to go forward with military tribunals for detainees at the Gitmole Military Base in Cuba. The 5-3 rule remains officials will either have to come up with new procedures to prosecute at least 10 so-called enemy courts.

[00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:53.940]
The case was a major test of President Bush's authority as Commander-in-Chief of a wartime setting. Bush has aggressively asserted the power of the government and of course being the dictator that he thinks that he is to capture, detain and prosecute suspected terrorists in the wake of the 9-11 attacks. How do you like that? How do you like it? How do you like it? How do you like it? How do you like it? How do you like it? How do you like it? How do you like it? How do you like it? How do you like it? How do you like it? How do you like it? How do you like it? How do you like it? How do you like it? How do you like it? How do you like it? How do you like it? How do you like it? How do you like it? How do you like it? How do you like it? How do you like it? How do you like it? How do you like it? How do you like it

[00:23:54.960 --> 00:24:17.740]
and they showed a clip of Bush himself in the late 2001 after 9-11 announcing about the ... the... we are talking about the banking records he had already announced that. This was not any big secret. The York Times had a Wall Street Journal or the LA Times. This was no secret. This was no secret. Everybody knew about it. He announced it. They showed the clip.

[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:25.540]
And of course the fact that the Saudis didn't want to cooperate and released the banking records and that's because it was a Saudi operation in the first place

[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:28.120]
That are the ones who are funny most of the terrorism in the world anywhere

[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:33.660]
Good buddy. Fanned our bush and it got some a shbh. But nevertheless. What do you say? I'm saying let's get back to these dead people

Allister Cook don't put him on her Peter. He used to know that Jan Berry from Jan and Dean

[00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:20.960]
I know we're past the break, but I'm getting so whipped up about this. There's so many dead people

[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:25.840]
You know in fact, let's just put every dead person whoever died Bob Keeschen, can't and Kangaroo died

[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:40.080]
known for such films as touch of evil and the excesses she did the she was always confused her with somebody else

[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:45.480]
But she's the one to the voices I can this more head is who you confuse her with oh well, it's Mercedes-Makambridge

[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:47.240]
You know what I was

So it's like yeah, whatever she said. Yeah, that was Mercedes. She's in so put with everyone's on you want

[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:56.380]

Because we have a late start on the pole and we get a thousand names on there in the East get one vote

[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:05.860]

[00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:51.200]
There's a big oldies folder in there and it's all in there. You know, I'm really I'm really a torn because I'm wondering

[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:55.580]
Maybe somebody in the audience would know I would usually don't know because you were asking me like about the

[00:40:55.580 --> 00:41:00.060]
Adoking station right because I totally got the logic to take one and it's pretty good

Yeah, which is how it sounds. No, it sounds pretty good

[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:08.620]

[00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:13.240]
Would it in other words with a music quality be that better or is there like a limitation on the quality of the

Music because it's in the iPod. No, I'm saying no because that's just data. Doesn't matter where it's reading it from. It's it's all a matter of

[00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:24.060]
So in other words, if I might go spend a lot of a lot of money and give me like a real fancy schmancy doc

[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:26.720]
That's right. I can make that seem something to concert hall. That's correct

[00:53:07.770 --> 00:53:11.530]
He was good but don't put him on because nobody knows who that is. Let's see 2002

[00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:22.690]
Abba even died who? Oh, no even Rosen Abba even he was the former uh, he's a big Jew. It's really ambassador to be when you don't remember

We got we're gonna get to 500 pretty soon here about all 427 you guys are just crickering and creeping along man

[00:53:38.570 --> 00:53:41.210]
This this ain't gonna cut it say I'm not an idiot

[00:53:41.730 --> 00:53:45.730]
Now if we were to start it with our four five hundred like usual we'd already be pushed push in a thousand

[00:53:45.730 --> 00:53:50.730]
We'd have it look but we started from scratch today. We are gonna be able to do this. We can't get to a thousand

[00:53:50.730 --> 00:53:53.290]
What's our goal 750? Yeah, seven

[00:53:54.070 --> 00:54:00.530]
750 you always said you always set the bar low. I said it high. Why? Just seven. I didn't say seven fifty seven

[00:54:00.530 --> 00:54:04.430]
Oh seven. Seven right. I say 750. We got 429 right now

[00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:07.030]
And that's all some pre people to be doing between now and two o'clock

[00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:09.730]
Instead of sitting out there working up a big skim cancer

[00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:14.730]
That's what they're doing. They're working up a big to to to to to to tumor or something and then move the great Santini

Mm-hmm. Here's another guy that I just absolutely love. He is just so great Robert Duval

[00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:23.330]
I know that he's gotten a lot of accolades and accolites and this stuff

[00:54:23.330 --> 00:54:26.610]
But it just when you when people ordinarily start giving off a list of great actors

[00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:30.110]
He's even a lot of times gets overlooked. You know it does Robert Duval

[00:54:30.110 --> 00:54:33.810]
He's I would say he's one of the five to ten if you were gonna pick ten

[00:54:33.810 --> 00:54:40.270]
He's gonna make the list all time best. No, okay character actors. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely great Robert Duval

[00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:42.970]
He was even great in network especially the part actor Josh fell asleep

One point you could just you know what seriously. Let's try for the rest of the summer you you try tomorrow

[00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:16.890]

6.6 their number two in a morning. That's Ron and all and like I said when Stern's not on the air

[00:59:58.850 --> 01:00:01.530]
They do really well when they have any competition like a real show

[01:00:01.530 --> 01:00:04.990]
They all of a sudden start swooning over there ancient polynomial Ron

[01:00:05.530 --> 01:00:11.750]
Radio on more 6.3 radio mom b 6.1 you see the ethnic thing here W. X d j that's another

[01:00:18.130 --> 01:00:23.710]
Got QBA and no speaking English 3.8 you've got an ethnic battleground there. It sounds like to me

[01:00:24.250 --> 01:00:30.430]
CMQ FM in the morning 3.8 their number time for eighth does anybody speak English here? No

[01:00:31.550 --> 01:00:35.470]
Well, let's see I would see 3.1 in the morning. I don't know what would they got news in the crap

[01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:40.230]
I don't know what they do. Oh, and then they also got that Glenn Beck from nine that's whatever rhymes with Drek

[01:00:41.450 --> 01:00:41.770]
kiss

[01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:45.810]
Okay, everybody QA in the morning not to promising there

[01:00:45.810 --> 01:00:49.710]
We had a 2-2 in the winner then up to a 2-3 in the next round and now hangs back with his 2-2

[01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:56.890]
Number 18 in men. This is a sports show. See a sports show number 18 2-2. What kind of a thing is that? Have a 2-2

[01:00:57.910 --> 01:00:59.590]
So there must be a big one. I'll tell you that

[01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:01.110]
W-I-N-Z

[01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:04.590]
Scare America down to a 1.6 they're vanishing from the scene

[01:01:04.590 --> 01:01:09.530]
They went over like a pregnant pool of water in the middle of July and it's only the late part of June and

[01:01:10.530 --> 01:01:17.170]
Waxi this is their strong suit. Maybe it's when the superhead is on Joe Rosemite's

[01:01:17.770 --> 01:01:25.870]
1.2 a 1.2 share. How do you like that? How do you give you an update of what took place just now off the air? No, okay

[01:01:26.890 --> 01:01:27.150]
Oh

[01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:33.850]
That's the part where he says Howard just called and called me a cool remember that I do meaning more Howard

[01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:39.550]
That's mr. Dave mr. Howard's got you know. He's got relative who's in too bad you know, okay

[01:01:40.450 --> 01:01:44.070]
Okay, so it's not looking too often good. There's four stock radio is done in this market

[01:01:44.070 --> 01:01:46.330]
Now that's what you accomplished across the street

[01:01:46.330 --> 01:01:50.150]
You came in and you diluted it's like taking a fine wine well, wasn't all that fine in the first place

[01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:53.630]
But taking like a medium priced wine and diluting it with like tap water

[01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:59.530]
Take a barrel of ripple and just goes patient away. Maybe that's it mid days in men

[01:01:59.530 --> 01:02:03.050]
A radio mom being or speeding glaze a key seven point you ferry

[01:02:03.050 --> 01:02:03.710]
Oh

[01:02:04.290 --> 01:02:08.710]
Seven point you feel like there's a number one but again all their listeners are over the age of 100

[01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:13.610]
So once we get the demo straightened out that they're no factor WCM QFM a 6.1

[01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:16.730]
So actually when we extrapolate this we got a shot life

[01:02:16.730 --> 01:02:19.630]
Hot or let's see how Ricky Tiki didn't in men in the morning

[01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:23.890]
Our good buddy Ricky Tiki we just celebrated 50 years on the air magic

[01:02:23.890 --> 01:02:27.970]
Three six down to about two nine oh, well 50's a good time to hang it up

[01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:36.650]
Hot 4.8 W.I.O.D. 4.5 WQM at least we're on the first page. We're number eight in men

[01:02:36.650 --> 01:02:39.390]
But that's 10 to three if you take the two to three hour out there

[01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:43.470]
We'd be like right then and somewhere would be all I'm saying somewhere

[01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:49.350]
No, we'd have a five something at least we'd be top four on the Titanic. That's not easy to do now

[01:02:49.350 --> 01:02:51.330]
What about Waxi in the mid-day? What about a radio

[01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:58.910]
Error obscure America they got a two point oh mid-day in men. I still can't find Waxi. Oh, yeah

[01:02:58.910 --> 01:03:02.390]
They're making some inroads isn't that what they were saying Josh a couple weeks ago somebody calls them

[01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:05.070]
They're on the ear saying we're making some inroads. Yeah, they're doing something

[01:03:05.070 --> 01:03:08.750]
Yeah, they went from a one two down to a 1.1 a 1.1

[01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:13.030]
Basically, they fought a nice even level there. It starts with a one all

[01:03:13.470 --> 01:03:19.190]
Day long including in the afternoon where they highly touted younger and hip or dandelabastered

[01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:22.970]
Let's see the coast the coast. Oh, I must be missing a page in the afternoon

[01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:28.510]
You must have screwed that up or I might maybe I did when I put them together. I don't know. I just facts them as they were

[01:03:28.510 --> 01:03:29.850]
I'm sorry my bad

[01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:35.670]
My bad we get my stapler out over here. It's quite a production when you send me these eight million pages

[01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:41.810]
You know I do radio on more as number one in the afternoon and men radio on more anybody speaking in English

[01:03:42.510 --> 01:03:43.230]
Aki no

[01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:49.090]
Not 105 big io d with a four five. That's time to smitmeister four five

[01:03:49.650 --> 01:03:53.370]
Let's see how well the sports guys are doing and on the first page and on the second page

[01:03:53.370 --> 01:03:54.470]
Holy Toledo

[01:03:54.470 --> 01:04:00.010]
Well would Rick weaver roll over in his grave if we could see these numbers the third page wq and we went from a two three

[01:04:00.010 --> 01:04:01.150]
Oh, we have to a two point eight

[01:04:01.150 --> 01:04:06.550]
So that number is probably about a four if you scratch take the three o'clock hour there at three to seven right right

[01:04:06.550 --> 01:04:11.430]
Plus the fact man is he's never on anyway and when he is on he's on to like six 30 because we have that Marlon preguing crap

[01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:17.330]
I mean a great pregame show so two point eight that's up a couple of losses from 20th in the previous trend little improvement there

[01:04:17.330 --> 01:04:21.670]
Two point eight keep that number in mind when you look for waxy how's there America doing in the afternoon?

[01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:28.690]
Or they drop from a three point two two six not too good and waxy the younger and hiprodannel a bastard a toss a good game

[01:04:28.690 --> 01:04:34.310]
And it's got all those buddies in the media writing a good game. He's got a one point two down from a one six in the last trend a

[01:04:34.310 --> 01:04:37.890]
One point two. Oh my god. Amen. Couldn't have said a bit of myself

[01:04:39.110 --> 01:04:40.570]
That is scary

[01:04:42.070 --> 01:04:47.850]
I don't know if I want to go through the whole thing with persons 2554 all I will say is that we got a three point two here on a show

[01:04:48.210 --> 01:04:53.090]
And since we have no women you double that means it's about a six four and that's 10 to three so we got we got a shot

[01:04:53.090 --> 01:04:56.590]
It may be about a seven share in here in many 25 to eight bro. We got a shot

[01:04:56.590 --> 01:04:59.510]
It may be a little bonus money in here if we get it like a little kiss in June

[01:04:59.510 --> 01:05:01.910]
No, it's not nothing wrong with a kiss in June

[01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:06.350]
So I was with tuned and moon and ca ca moon

[01:05:07.210 --> 01:05:10.830]
465 if we can get to 500 votes by the top of the hour going to be really dangerous

[01:05:10.830 --> 01:05:11.770]
You'll see

[01:05:14.070 --> 01:05:16.470]
And I believe we're gonna pull it right out of our record

[01:05:20.170 --> 01:05:20.690]
Good

[01:05:22.650 --> 01:05:31.930]
Bring did you win and you will win good guy that had so much more to give but you marry the psychotic

[01:05:32.570 --> 01:05:32.690]

The drink of finger got in each

[01:05:38.310 --> 01:05:48.330]
But the good news is that cheap blue ourselves low way calls everybody knows that in LA they let burners walk every day

[01:05:51.150 --> 01:05:57.690]
Another last the house died thanks to your psychotic wife who had a stupid thing like

[01:05:57.690 --> 01:06:05.130]
Bring and use radio was a main show except that you were there

You put all that in your life would have lasted long

[01:06:17.290 --> 01:06:19.610]
But she left you no choice

You made a promise

[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:35.620]

[01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:44.800]
So

[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:51.100]
In the case and that's the reason you let me

[01:06:53.560 --> 01:07:01.000]

We won't get any votes anyway. Well, that's right. Why do we want to put him on it?

[01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:44.920]
I am bishop we can put on there. I don't want to round for redneck

No one else can do the benching

[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:43.220]
We just know it's not quite the same

[01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:46.760]
TVK shows won't be the same, but the G-May bird is light

[01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:49.940]
Those neilestars are forever gone

[01:16:49.940 --> 01:16:52.080]
Life TVL Joy centers you on

[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:55.920]
So we could you win, baby, there's no more panic left

[01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:58.380]
Windchip gossips of the background to melt

[01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:00.500]
And threat suffers the worst jacked rubber

[01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:02.940]
You'll never know why God offers up now

[01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:04.280]
The G-May bird is light

[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:07.140]
There won't be a reunion at fall

[01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:09.300]
Curls us a burning wind to eat the gold

[01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:11.440]
Don't be playing match games at all

[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:12.980]
Now the G-May bird is light

[01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:17.000]
Windchip gossips of the background to melt

[01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:18.740]
Windchip gossips of the background to melt

[01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:20.340]
We still ask you where God is

[01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:21.900]
Our personality never clank

[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:24.260]
Until we gave each other great consent

[01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:26.000]
Thank you for match games we had

[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.300]
G-May bird is light

[01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:28.620]
When the weekend was seen as now

[01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:28.860]
Black

[01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:30.380]
G-May bird is light

[01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:32.220]
In the stomach

[01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:33.320]
G-May bird is light

[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:35.500]
On the tip of your life to light

[01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:37.580]
And on the tip of your life to light

[01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:39.240]
Everyone else could go to light

[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:41.340]
G-May bird is light

[01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:43.740]
G-May bird is light

[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:46.300]
Somebody says one of our factors

[01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:48.260]
Dean Raybrum we got a mother I'm sure by now

[01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:49.240]
And Jack Lemon

[01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:50.460]
Yeah right

[01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:52.880]
Now what was it that Jack Lemon said?

[01:17:53.620 --> 01:17:54.080]
Push the button

[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:55.220]
Oh no, and I got it

[01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:56.980]
You get all you was one second there

[01:17:56.980 --> 01:17:58.180]
And you make me look like this

[01:17:58.180 --> 01:17:58.920]
Stop, stop, stop, stop

[01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:00.460]
You were quite important

[01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:00.780]
Okay

[01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:01.980]
There you go

[01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:03.900]
We got 536 votes on the pool

[01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:06.500]
You have little faith you think we can't get to like 600

[01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:07.280]
You're dreaming

[01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:08.280]
Oh

[01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:09.640]
Do you like to drink?

[01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:12.560]
538 man in the sunshine state

[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:14.580]
In fact we got 5 we're gonna have 540

[01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:15.680]
Not a good spot on the dial

[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:17.280]
Let's move down to the ass end of the dial

[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:18.560]
We're already pretty close to it

[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.080]
Get away from that human interference

[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:23.320]
And Bishop did we put a runner or what?

[01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:24.920]
I should probably put a handbook

[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:26.340]
Did you put a runner Josh?

[01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:27.100]
I don't know

[01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:29.320]
He knows you know he's got so many names on there

[01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:30.640]
He's like we're ready to plot

[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:31.900]
I'm gonna go with yes

[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:34.480]
Plus nobody is voting for any of these anyway

[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:36.340]
You know like you didn't put a runner

[01:18:36.340 --> 01:18:36.900]
Get out of here

[01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:37.580]
You see don't belong

[01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:39.040]
Nobody's gonna vote for an Bishop

[01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:39.820]
Are you crazy?

[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:40.660]
To white might

[01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:42.880]
I mean if Jack Part is now to vote

[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:44.940]
If Jan Berry has no votes

[01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:47.040]
Last time I looked for Marlon Brando

[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:48.000]
He didn't have any votes either

[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.660]
That would leave me so distraught

[01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:51.100]
Can you see it?

[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:52.360]
Can you find where Marlon Brando is?

[01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:52.660]
Yeah Brando is

[01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:53.560]
And Bishop is on there

[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:53.900]
I know that

[01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:55.140]
She is in here and she got a vote

[01:18:55.140 --> 01:18:56.600]
I told you she was on there

[01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:56.940]
What is it?

[01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:58.080]
You are so argumentative man

[01:18:58.080 --> 01:18:58.960]
I must be working with Georgia

[01:18:58.960 --> 01:18:59.920]
I know it's three days

[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:00.860]
I trained him on

[01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:03.500]
Marlon Brando finally got three

[01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:05.060]
Well it's about time some of you dead

[01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:06.140]
As good off your ass

[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:08.120]
My stand major would say

[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:09.700]
If you get off your ass and call the show

[01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:11.620]
I wouldn't be sitting here talking about Milky Way dark

[01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:13.320]
And about who bought a good watch

[01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:17.320]
I was thinking about stand major

[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:17.980]
I was at the airport

[01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:19.520]
Maybe that's why I lost my Blackberry

[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:21.920]
The air is skipful airport in Amsterdam

[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:23.080]
Waiting for the flight to Berlin

[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:24.300]
Or yeah

[01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:25.800]
Or the flight back to here I guess

[01:19:26.340 --> 01:19:27.820]
I was thinking about stand major

[01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:29.340]
I was thinking at my two grand

[01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:30.340]
Probably worth about a million

[01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:31.820]
By now when you think with interest

[01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:35.080]
Also speak out of that thing before about the shooting people's heads off

[01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:36.780]
Like Bill Hartman

[01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:39.160]
A man who believed this cat was sick

[01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:42.820]
And shot his head off was acquitted by a jury after a half hour deliberations

[01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:44.160]
I would take it about 10 seconds

[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:45.160]
That I said nice job pal

[01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:45.840]
I have a great day

[01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:46.600]
Good work

[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:49.180]
This is from the Harold Nobles by Amy Sherman

[01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:51.180]
I wonder if she's came to Alan Sherman or General

[01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:51.960]
Awww

[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:54.460]
Some might call it the Kitty Kavorkian defense

[01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:54.940]
Says

[01:19:55.620 --> 01:19:57.020]
In a Broward County courtroom yesterday

[01:19:57.020 --> 01:19:58.460]
Michael Stewart

[01:19:58.460 --> 01:19:58.660]
Stewart

[01:19:59.780 --> 01:20:02.040]
Classed the vacuum cleaner handle as if it were a shotgun

[01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:04.620]
And with a fluffy stuffed animal in his other hand

[01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:07.140]
Demonstrated how he shot Mama Kitty's head off

[01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:09.680]
Mama Kitty being his beloved long hair feline

[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:10.720]
Which he said was ill

[01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:12.300]
An acting anti social

[01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:13.800]
You know what that means don't you

[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:15.060]
Oh she was a pain in the air

[01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:19.120]
So like Dr. Jack the Detroit doctor was sitting more than a hundred mercy killings

[01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:21.580]
Stewart decided to put her as pet out of her misery

[01:20:21.580 --> 01:20:22.380]
How would you say that?

[01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:23.820]
STUEVE

[01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:25.260]
Stewart Stewart

[01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:26.820]
I don't know, sounds good to me

[01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:28.620]
How about Stewart Irwin

[01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:30.780]
Well I bet you chicken eggs just fall off the couch

[01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:32.000]
Stewart Irwin

[01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:36.460]
I held her away so she wasn't looking at me in a shotter

[01:20:36.460 --> 01:20:40.080]
Says Stewart you describing his final moments with the candy on for at least 13 years

[01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:42.420]
But I guess 13 was not lucky enough for that kitty

[01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:43.640]
She didn't know what hit her

[01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:46.300]
And apparently in Florida it is not illegal to do this

[01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:47.980]
Oh god now you tell me

[01:20:48.580 --> 01:20:52.040]
The state's animal cruelty law allows pet owners to kill their own pets in a

[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:53.300]
Humane and proficient manner

[01:20:53.300 --> 01:20:55.880]
When the animal is suffering and his near death or can't be cured

[01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:56.540]
Hey tiny

[01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:00.680]
The jury reached its verdict in just 30 minutes

[01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:01.780]
Fuck 30 minutes

[01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:04.400]
Quitting Steve 38 away felony animal cruelty

[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:06.940]
Charger convicted he could have faced up to five years in the slimer

[01:21:06.940 --> 01:21:09.400]
When the verdict was read Steve broke down and cried

[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:11.120]
I'm sure he had nothing to do with the verdict

[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:13.080]
It was missing his little kitty cat

[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:13.740]
What do you think?

[01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:14.420]
I meant

[01:21:14.420 --> 01:21:18.260]
Although during the trial he didn't admit that he started drinking before shooting Mama kitty

[01:21:18.260 --> 01:21:22.100]
But we testified to consume most of the tequila and beer after the act to forget what happened

[01:21:22.100 --> 01:21:23.480]
To wipe it off his head you know

[01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:24.180]
That's right

[01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:27.640]
You decided to terminate your beloved pet's life in between shots

[01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:29.080]
The prosecutor asked?

[01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:30.140]
Yes he said

[01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:34.360]
The French attorney Denise Heward presented the stewie as a no-nonsense guy

[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:36.880]
A heavy equipment operator who worked at a quarry

[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:39.760]
And was proficient with firearms since he grew up on a Minnesota farm

[01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:42.740]
She maintained that Mama kitty's heart condition was in need fatal

[01:21:42.740 --> 01:21:44.620]
She described how his precious feelings

[01:21:44.620 --> 01:21:47.140]
Health I deteriorated in the weeks leading up to the shooting

[01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:49.720]
She bumped into objects had a running nose and dry skin

[01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:52.460]
Well I got kind of a running nose lately and dry skin so

[01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:55.720]
She just wasn't being herself to leave

[01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:57.720]
She wouldn't come back and meet me after work anymore

[01:21:57.720 --> 01:21:58.980]
She was being anti-social

[01:21:59.420 --> 01:21:59.780]
Oh

[01:21:59.780 --> 01:22:04.260]
Later he chuckled as he reminisced how Mama kitty would relieve herself in front of his bedroom door

[01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:06.200]
And protest if her litter box wasn't tidy

[01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:07.620]
How do you like that?

[01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:09.900]
In other words if the litter box wasn't up to her respect

[01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:12.040]
She'd like to leave a number outside the door

[01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:12.880]
I said a message

[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:13.260]
Yes

[01:22:13.260 --> 01:22:14.320]
That alone

[01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:15.480]
You know I take care of that

[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:16.520]
Sticker ass in a microwave

[01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:17.800]
Although that doesn't make a mess

[01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:19.120]
I think he took the right

[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:20.480]
I think he took the right route

[01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:22.660]
Don't Jew?

[01:22:22.660 --> 01:22:23.400]
Jess

[01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:25.640]
Now what's the story with all these faxes?

[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:28.020]
Oh, Pete the Bordop faxes and says a pig report

[01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:30.800]
The BSO, Griffith and Southwest 16th Avenue

[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:33.220]
Hiding behind the nursery sign

[01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:36.360]
Thanks Pete the Bordop and what are we going to do about your fax machines

[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:37.000]
Not mine

[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.720]
I got a good machine mine

[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:41.220]
Maybe your toner is on on the last legs

[01:22:41.220 --> 01:22:42.220]
Maybe you got some kind of a problem

[01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:43.280]
I'm just mentioning that

[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:44.500]
You got a whole week to work on it

[01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:45.920]
Because I don't have another show until next Thursday

[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:48.140]
For two and a half hours before the Marling game

[01:22:48.140 --> 01:22:48.920]
That's how it came through

[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:51.080]
Some come through really bright

[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:52.060]
And some don't

[01:22:52.060 --> 01:22:53.340]
No, but it's got the line down the middle

[01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:54.820]
What do you what do you be talking about?

[01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:56.180]
All right

[01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:57.220]
See these other faxes

[01:22:57.220 --> 01:23:00.240]
Well they've all got the big double black line down the middle

[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:01.520]
Let's not how they're coming through

[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:03.380]
You know that's the one from University

[01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:04.900]
Dodge came through the black line

[01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:06.280]
That's coming through that way

[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:08.340]
Because your machine is not a good machine mine

[01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:08.700]
All right

[01:23:08.700 --> 01:23:10.840]
You've got to screw up my machine mine

[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:15.260]
With overwhelming support from Berkeley residents in California

[01:23:15.260 --> 01:23:17.180]
The Berkeley City Council unanimously

[01:23:17.180 --> 01:23:21.300]
Past the resolution to the United to be the first jurisdiction in the U.S. to let the public vote

[01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:24.700]
For the impeachment of President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney

[01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:30.540]
The measure will appear on the November 7th ballot across about 10 grand

[01:23:30.540 --> 01:23:35.560]
Among those who urged the council to approve the initiative were presactive as Cindy Sheen and Daniel Ellsberg

[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:39.220]
As well as 500 Berkeley residents who sent supportive emails to City Hall

[01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:41.820]
Only three residents said they were against the idea

[01:23:41.820 --> 01:23:43.140]
How do you like that?

[01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:46.820]
The council agreed to drop a provision that would have set up a task force

[01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:49.760]
of Berkeley residents to monitor the president and vice president

[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:51.280]
How do you like that, Moe D'Appel?

[01:23:51.380 --> 01:23:52.620]
Sir, they're monitoring them

[01:23:52.620 --> 01:23:53.880]
Speaking of monitoring

[01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:57.040]
We'll be able to have some better relations with China

[01:23:57.900 --> 01:23:58.680]
Yeah, yeah

[01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:03.480]
Britney Spears poses nude for cover of Harper's Bazaar

[01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:04.280]
Is that kind of Bazaar?

[01:24:04.580 --> 01:24:05.860]
We'll get to that story after the break up

[01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:07.320]
A lot of stuff to get to here

[01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:09.060]
Because we've been poaching around with these trends

[01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:10.620]
Which didn't really change all that much

[01:24:10.620 --> 01:24:12.880]
Except for across the street where they really went in the tank

[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:14.640]
Including one member that started with a

[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:14.720]
Oh

[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:15.160]
Again

[01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:16.080]
Oh man

[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:17.500]
We got the big O

[01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:19.420]
And they got the point something

[01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:21.020]
And we're talking a big game

[01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:21.960]
Or make a real in-rose

[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:23.820]
I can't wait to see Barry Jackass

[01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:24.840]
When the whole book comes out

[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:26.400]
I can't wait to end Jim Sarny

[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:27.920]
Although Sarny ought to like us now

[01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:29.720]
Because we got his buddy Evan Cohen on the second

[01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:31.020]
No one understands a good guy

[01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:31.700]
But you know

[01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:34.020]
Just Evan know that Sarny's got to blow up all of him

[01:24:34.020 --> 01:24:35.220]
Does he better tell him that?

[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:36.560]
I think he picked for it

[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:37.600]
Oh man

[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:39.660]
Hey Evan Sarny wants you baby

[01:24:41.180 --> 01:24:42.520]
553 votes in Jota Masio

[01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:43.240]
Hasn't got a lick

[01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:44.220]
Can you believe that?

[01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:45.300]
To his Murray to Marilyn Monroe

[01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:46.960]
He hasn't got a lick from this audience

[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:48.160]
Stop from the audience, Evan

[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:49.880]
He probably don't look too good anymore

[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:51.960]
He never did look even in life he didn't look too good

[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:53.680]
The good news is Marlon Brando

[01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:54.960]
Finally is making a little bit of a move

[01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:56.000]
He's got four

[01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:56.640]
Okay

[01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:59.100]
Aren't you excited about that Marlon starting to make a move?

[01:24:59.420 --> 01:24:59.920]
Oh that's something

[01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:01.460]
But when you waste 600 pounds and eight

[01:25:01.460 --> 01:25:02.200]
Easy to make a move

[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:03.700]
Ask fat boy if you ever see him again

[01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:06.160]
This is Neil Roger

[01:25:07.420 --> 01:25:09.760]
This is 5608

[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:13.480]
This is Mark Morgan

[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:16.280]
Is the 12 to 1 hour on QAM

[01:25:17.060 --> 01:25:18.940]
Now from the channel to him

[01:25:18.940 --> 01:25:20.880]
I'm going to set the QAM

[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:22.460]
Hey where's Ann going?

[01:25:22.820 --> 01:25:24.400]
What's she doing with that machine gun?

[01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:25.680]
Oh my god

[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:26.800]
Well, where's the wife?

[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:29.980]
She was fed up with reading one story

[01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:32.600]
After another about drugs and violence

[01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:35.600]
Now she wants to write the rules

[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:37.500]
And rewrite the news

[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:38.600]
In

[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:39.780]

I'll see you tonight at 5608

[01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:48.540]
Stop

[01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:49.700]
And

[01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:50.300]
Follow

[01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:53.820]
She took the news into her own head

[01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:56.120]
What are you going to do with me?

[01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:57.200]
When I get through with you

[01:25:57.200 --> 01:26:01.140]
There won't be enough of you left to make a good two-take for Don Noll

[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:02.140]
And

[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:04.680]

[01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:11.940]
Don No

[01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:13.160]
There's a stationary

[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:14.600]
Grunt on the bed well

[01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:15.400]
And

[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:16.000]
Both

[01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:16.860]
She

Both

[01:26:21.060 --> 01:26:21.460]
Coming

[01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:21.900]
Two

[01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:23.540]
Are we sure miss that old guy?

[01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:23.920]
Don't we?

[01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:24.120]
No

[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:26.000]
Or she hated me like poison

[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.340]
Every time her name comes up I feel compelled to mention it

[01:26:28.340 --> 01:26:29.620]
Heated me like poison

[01:26:29.620 --> 01:26:31.040]
This because I call her a fat old guy

[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:33.480]
Conny or I mean you know nothing worse than holding your grudge right

[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:33.920]
Great

[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:34.600]
Bitch

[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:37.080]
She's dead and Sandy Patens got the body

[01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:39.200]
561 votes on the pool

[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:40.940]
Look at all the people who have no votes

[01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:41.820]
Gene Rayburn

[01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:43.320]
See I'll say it again

[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:44.860]
If you're going to fact something in

[01:26:44.860 --> 01:26:46.440]
Hop on your PC

[01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:48.480]
Hop on this and vote for it

[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:49.560]
You know they they like

[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:51.060]
Want us to do this come on do it

[01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:51.400]
Do it

[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:53.000]
Put it on there and then they won't vote for it

[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.180]
Then that crossed your ass a little bit

[01:26:54.180 --> 01:26:54.720]
No no no no

[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:55.460]
How about Dr. Bob

[01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:58.240]
How about all you fat slabs who are still alive because of Dr. Bob

[01:26:58.240 --> 01:26:59.780]
And don't tell me the Atkins doesn't work

[01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:00.520]
It works

[01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:01.620]
Slob rhymes with Bob

[01:27:01.620 --> 01:27:02.260]
Right

[01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:03.800]
Dr. Bob Slob

[01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:05.460]
Just because he had a little slip and fall

[01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:06.840]
And of course they used them

[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:07.620]
Medical list them

[01:27:07.620 --> 01:27:09.540]
The the purveyors of fat

[01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:12.400]
To try to say oh look at that he ballooned up to yeah

[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:14.560]
He ballooned up because he was like retaining water there

[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:15.720]
He was like in a coma

[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:16.400]
You idiots

[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:17.500]
He wasn't fat

[01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:19.680]
In fact you remember we uh you remember it very well

[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:21.160]
I'm sure were you a part of that whole deal

[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:21.920]
Yes I was

[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:23.240]
What was the name of that book?

[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:24.440]
Submitting over there in the sawgrass

[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:25.280]
I think that's it

[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:27.500]
We sold over 700 copies of his uh

[01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:28.360]
Book Dr. Bob

[01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:30.040]
And don't tell me the Atkins doesn't work

[01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:31.480]
It works it's good for you

[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:32.040]
It works

[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:33.440]
In fact you know something

[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:36.700]
In Germany one thing you don't see very much of fat people

[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:40.940]
Really very very you could count them on the fingers of one thumb

[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:42.900]
And you know what they eat?

[01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:43.520]
Rock worst

[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:44.680]
Meat oh yeah

[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:45.580]
Meat man

[01:27:45.580 --> 01:27:48.640]
They're big meat eaters schnitzel and brats and

[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:50.260]
Curry worse than the

[01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:52.420]
Listen at and they're not fat

[01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:55.780]
Because they don't eat a lot of carbs and I didn't do too much uh like you know

[01:27:55.780 --> 01:27:57.300]
Well whatever who cares

[01:27:57.300 --> 01:27:59.300]
566 votes you people won't care

[01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:01.860]
You want to hear about subscribe and I'm not going to waste your time I'm going to bore you

[01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:03.260]
Let's talk about Britney Spears

[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:06.020]
Which they also don't care about that bitch anymore either

[01:28:06.020 --> 01:28:08.200]
She's her drop she has dropped out of grace

[01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:14.120]
A six month pregnant Britney Spears has posed nude for the cover of the August issue of Harper's bizarre magazine

[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:21.480]
And a company photos spread inside much in the style of the famous 1991 vanity fair cover of an naked and heavily pregnant

[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:25.220]
They mean more now. What do they say that she posed nude because she didn't

[01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:30.300]
I don't believe it

[01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:31.240]
Look at that girl

[01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:35.400]
Anyway on the Harper's bizarre cover a dark hair

[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:41.700]
Spears covers her breasts with her arms and crosses her legs at the knee and she sits smiling in the camera

[01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:42.280]
What is that?

[01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:43.800]
It's not nude as she's wearing a bra

[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:45.280]
Well that's not nude

[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:45.900]
I know

[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:50.900]
Harper said that the pop singer's spears was never more beautiful than when a photographer a week ago

[01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:55.580]
With the first time I printed a nude photo on its cover. It's not nude. Nude means naked

[01:28:55.580 --> 01:29:01.020]
That's right. Not what they were covering up all the important parts and then wearing a bra to top it all off

[01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:05.040]
Jesus God almost they put out goals you know they were the bra would that make him naked?

[01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:07.160]
He could probably use the cash by the way

[01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:11.940]
The magazine edited since word leaked out about the shoot on Monday people have been desperate to get their hands on the

[01:29:11.940 --> 01:29:16.680]
exclusive photos which were posted on various websites without permission from the magazine. Well, that'll go get them

[01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:18.300]

[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:41.140]
Oops, I did it again. Spears is frequently complained that she's hunted by paparazzi and earlier this month

[01:29:41.140 --> 01:29:44.280]
Appealed to them to leave her alone. She wants to be left alone

[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:47.700]
She also recently came out of criticism for driving with a baby in her lap

[01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:52.160]
We don't know and interview with that we know that you know about Kevin Feudeline. I don't care about her

[01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:55.200]
She was real pristine and clean and now she's a mess

[01:29:56.560 --> 01:30:01.080]
So I go is to see your faxes all have this line down the middle. Well, maybe it's your machine

[01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:06.240]
In other words, the one you just said me did not have lines down the middle. No, are you serious? I'm serious

[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:10.760]
Are you sure you take a look at my machine, man? It might be a cartridge needs to be changed or something

[01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:11.240]
No

[01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:14.380]
Absolutely, no, you should take it out and shake it

[01:30:14.380 --> 01:30:20.040]
There's nothing wrong with a cartridge to say on their toner low because they usually do that like a week before we need to change it

[01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:24.280]
How about you toner cartridges man? I had all my school supplies right here my drawers

[01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:33.060]
Anyway, Ginger says oh Ginger. Uh-huh. He say for this pool, Dr. Edward Teller fatherly hydrogen bomb a moniker he did tested

Dr. Teller was a brilliant scientist and accomplished pianist a lovely man my adopted grandfather a

[01:30:40.940 --> 01:30:45.740]
Supposed parody of Dr. Teller Dr. Strangeloves portrayed by Peter Sellers Dr. Teller received over

[01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:50.640]
3,000 hyperburet oxygen treatments and lived and worked at a genius level until the age of 96

[01:30:51.260 --> 01:30:55.880]
He received over 3000 hyperburet oxygen treatments look what it did for Michael Jackson

[01:30:56.560 --> 01:31:00.940]
Thank you Ginger, isn't that pretty interesting? Mm-hmm. I mean not real real interesting

[01:31:00.940 --> 01:31:05.820]
But moderately interesting and it's from a brow or number so Ginger must be in brow. What do you like that?

[01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:07.400]

[01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:42.540]
The move reflects the growing seriousness of a 24-year-old who's collegiate parting provided endless fun for gossip calm

[01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:47.180]
This is found this first years in orifice. It also offers an escape from Washington spotlight

[01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:05.100]
Maybe that's it. Maybe Bush. She wants to be Jewish

[01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:07.660]
That's why he was reading upside down and right to left

[01:32:08.860 --> 01:32:11.540]

[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:48.860]
Yeah, at least it's a solid number. It doesn't have like a decimal in front of it with a zero

[01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:50.660]

Now I'll take one or two

[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:56.200]
The impact of today's Supreme Court decision on military commissions goes well beyond Gitmo

[01:38:56.200 --> 01:39:00.500]
The Supreme Court is ruled that the authorization for the use of military force

[01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:06.540]
The AUMF issued by Congress in the days after 9-11 is not a blank check for the administration

[01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:09.520]
And it's got like a section of the opinion that it quotes

[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:15.600]
And it says the point here is that the AUMF does not authorize activity that was not specifically contemplated

[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:21.200]
In the text or legislative history. This is incredibly significant the administration is relying on the AUMF

[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:26.420]
Suggestifies warrantless vise having program and then it quotes alberto v05 Gonzalez is saying audio audio

[01:39:26.420 --> 01:39:31.280]
And then it goes on to say the Bush administration doesn't argue that warrantless vise having was something specifically

[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:36.640]
Connoplayed in the text or by Congress rather the administration argues that it's implied as part of a broad

[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:40.960]
Authorization used all necessary and appropriate force the Supreme Court has rejected

[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:47.340]
That expansive interpretation which is a huge blow to the administration legal rationale for warrantless vise having

[01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:48.320]
How do you like that huh?

[01:39:48.700 --> 01:39:49.840]

[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:27.680]
Okay, no trans fat, huh?

[01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:32.180]
Tiny fat. They're fine. They're finally starting to catch out of that man trans fats

[01:40:33.620 --> 01:40:34.460]
That's the killer

[01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:38.680]
Not that any of you care of course is mostly a bunch of fat slugs like me

[01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:41.720]
So many Q.A.M. Hello about Aaron spelling

[01:40:42.500 --> 01:40:43.900]
Aaron spelling just died

[01:40:43.900 --> 01:40:47.740]
Well, that's not like a familiar voice or on the phone Aaron spelling his last words

[01:40:48.900 --> 01:40:52.320]
You want to put him on air? We're doing it now in honor of toy spelling

[01:40:52.860 --> 01:40:54.360]
How you spelling that wrong?

[01:40:55.060 --> 01:40:56.860]
5 6 7 0 5 60

[01:40:56.860 --> 01:41:02.100]
I see the guy even warm yet and already they're sticking into him. Got to put him on the pool

[01:41:02.100 --> 01:41:05.700]
Can't you just leave him alone for a little while and show a little bit of respect for the dead

[01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:13.240]
Not this crowd W.Q.A.M. Hello. Yeah, sir. I have a name for your call. Uh-huh. I'll name

[01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:17.160]
Yeah, okay W.Q.A.M. Hello

[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:22.420]
W.Q.A.M. Hello. Hey, near how about Jesus Christ

[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:27.700]
Said I mean life at it later

[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:32.360]
Yeah, put it put put it on hold in your mind and we'll have a big chuckle about it later after the show

[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:33.500]
I'll put it in the little trick here

[01:41:34.260 --> 01:41:39.160]
But all these you know, I mean I'm gonna tell you right now when you're dealing even with the ordinary audience

[01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:44.140]
And you hear what we usually get and then you realize that we're like with a teeny tiny sliver of the

[01:41:44.140 --> 01:41:48.000]
Dregs of the universe that's left in and town anywhere in Florida. Uh-huh

[01:41:48.540 --> 01:41:51.120]
What do you expect that we're gonna get? Why do you think I got my plans?

[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:55.620]
I mean you know I'm not gonna screw up all my plans. There's the bottom of the barrel than what's under that

[01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:58.820]
The barnacles where you're really good

[01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:03.400]
You ever buy a planter's cashews? Sure all the time. I love you. Yeah.

[01:42:03.620 --> 01:42:05.680]
One thing about me man, I've always got a can

[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:14.600]
I mean a planter's cashews in the house. We did a big one. Mm-hmm big can of it. Yeah, keep all always keep on our canvas that too

[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:17.800]
That's probably where you hide it

[01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:22.420]
And the Narks come by Georgia's house just looking to planter's a peanut in the ocean. That's right.

[01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:26.720]
I think a lot of time in the kitchen. Remember where Sigourney Weaver founded it was in the right carter or something remember that?

[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:28.620]
Yeah, but good stuff

[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:34.240]
I saw her for just a second. She was a clip of promo for something the other day on iFC

[01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:38.000]
I just I just love her. She did that movie just um, yeah

[01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:42.140]
Syllipify my love for Sigourney. We were at of course, amul her if you like her performances

[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:47.740]
It's a good movie, but made it better by her performance death and the maiden. Oh, yeah

[01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:55.320]
Yeah, death in the maven. Yeah, is that like Mike in the maven? It's just a one of these good movies where you don't really know where it's gonna go or how it's gonna end and

[01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:58.600]
Oh kind of like ginger. It's a stressful. I mean Jerry, right

[01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:02.480]
Please all you folks out there if you want to save yourself a lot of

[01:43:02.900 --> 01:43:06.120]
Angrervation don't watch Jerry no matter how much you like mad Damon

[01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:08.120]
How we gonna say no matter how much you like Casey

[01:43:08.580 --> 01:43:11.620]
Affleck, but who'd Ali the knows who that is much like there's no reason to like him

[01:43:11.620 --> 01:43:14.020]
He don't look good and he can't act other than that. He's great

[01:43:14.580 --> 01:43:19.460]
Oop plus he dies before I mean that Damon kills him before the end of the movie anyhow. So I just voted for you

[01:43:19.460 --> 01:43:21.860]
I saved you a lot of time and money jury

[01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:23.760]
W.A.M. Hello

[01:43:24.740 --> 01:43:32.420]
W.A.M. Hello Neil. Yes, sir. I have one for the poll I think uh-huh Frank Zappa Frank Zappa

[01:43:32.420 --> 01:43:36.400]
Can we leave him off of there? Thank you, sir. We just I think we did it the last time. That's right

[01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:39.780]
Although I think we ever did put him on there the first time. Let me take a look

[01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:43.460]
No, we couldn't have because all the names from the first time are on this one now Frank Zappa

[01:43:44.020 --> 01:43:44.860]
Hey there

[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:49.740]
Let's play the whole thing

[01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:52.680]
Face

[01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:54.140]
My teeth this time.

[01:43:54.900 --> 01:43:58.040]
I tell all the girls they can kiss my high teeth.

[01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:01.300]
But don't give I am, I'm not a famous school.

[01:44:01.940 --> 01:44:04.600]
I'm dressed in sharp and I'm acting new.

[01:44:04.980 --> 01:44:08.400]
I got a cheerleader here once they helped with my face.

[01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:11.960]
But they're better to all the work and they deserve all these.

[01:44:12.220 --> 01:44:12.840]
I don't think so.

[01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:17.540]
But with that, there was nothing wrong with that.

[01:44:18.020 --> 01:44:18.880]
Right up until there.

[01:44:19.980 --> 01:44:21.480]
I'll tell you what, you play it.

[01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:22.160]
Alright.

[01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:23.840]
See ya.

[01:44:24.100 --> 01:44:26.520]
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bobie, Bob.

[01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:28.520]
Bobie, Bob.

[01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:30.000]
What was that?

[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:31.000]
Bobie, Bob.

[01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:31.620]
Oh.

[01:44:33.340 --> 01:44:35.260]
622 votes on the poll about dead people.

[01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:35.820]
How do you like that?

[01:44:35.940 --> 01:44:40.340]
Only a South Florida would they enjoy so much of poll about stiffs and why not?

[01:44:40.740 --> 01:44:42.340]
Well here's Josh's line, line nine.

[01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:43.980]
Hey, you!

[01:44:44.460 --> 01:44:44.640]
Yeah.

[01:44:44.980 --> 01:44:46.620]
How about a poll of who he wants dead?

[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:47.620]
Yeah, okay.

[01:44:47.980 --> 01:44:49.760]
I know who'd lead and that's why we're not doing it.

[01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:53.560]
56670560, you guys don't need that knock on the door.

[01:44:53.700 --> 01:44:54.140]
I'm sure that.

[01:44:54.900 --> 01:44:55.600]
WQAM, hello.

[01:44:56.480 --> 01:44:56.880]
QAM.

[01:44:57.280 --> 01:44:57.580]
Neil.

[01:44:58.040 --> 01:44:58.400]
Yes, sir.

[01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:01.280]
I sure would love to let Susan Gray rule my route.

[01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:02.000]
Yeah, okay, good.

[01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:03.480]
WQAM, hello.

[01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:04.880]
QAM.

[01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:06.160]
Neil, how are you today?

[01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:06.660]
Okay.

[01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:07.900]
So he's good to hear you.

[01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:10.600]
And I've got, I really didn't hear a full-dissure poll.

[01:45:10.780 --> 01:45:13.300]
There's so many 1111111111.

[01:45:13.740 --> 01:45:15.140]
How about Jesus Christ, though?

[01:45:16.060 --> 01:45:16.540]
Let's see.

[01:45:18.540 --> 01:45:21.540]
I guess he was a public figure, yeah.

[01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:22.400]
Okay.

[01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:23.540]
Thank you, sir.

[01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:24.720]
How about money, Christ, though?

[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:25.160]
Okay.

[01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:26.360]
Yeah, how about Jesus Christ?

[01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:27.340]
How about the moment?

[01:45:27.780 --> 01:45:28.700]
We're still waiting for that.

[01:45:28.940 --> 01:45:29.700]
Love a big party.

[01:45:30.180 --> 01:45:30.620]
With pizza.

[01:45:31.340 --> 01:45:34.340]
We'll let Brad from Tony's catered the party.

[01:45:34.680 --> 01:45:35.220]
Oh, for me!

[01:45:36.120 --> 01:45:37.720]
Yeah, we'll still, in fact, we'll stuff something in a can.

[01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:38.700]
It's just got a task in.

[01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:41.860]
We'll stuff something most casket, basket, right?

[01:45:42.580 --> 01:45:42.680]
Right.

[01:45:42.940 --> 01:45:42.940]

[01:45:43.080 --> 01:45:45.220]
From what Reaper used to say into the beast as well.

[01:45:45.220 --> 01:45:47.040]
He used to say, well, let's get to do with the jingle birds.

[01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:50.840]
We don't want to get too graphic now, especially in the middle of lunchtime while I'm meeting my cashews.

[01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:53.460]
625 votes.

[01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:55.180]
You think we're going to make that 800 by 2 o'clock?

[01:45:55.620 --> 01:45:56.160]
Oh, we can cheat.

[01:45:56.840 --> 01:45:58.180]
No, we don't need to cheat.

[01:45:58.400 --> 01:45:59.800]
I just don't understand.

[01:46:00.500 --> 01:46:02.000]
This is a momentous day, man.

[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:03.200]
It's the 29th of June.

[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:05.880]
It's the day that sports talk radio officially died.

[01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:07.220]
A wicked death.

[01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:10.140]
You know who put the final nails in a coffin, by the way?

[01:46:10.500 --> 01:46:10.820]
I give up.

[01:46:11.220 --> 01:46:12.060]
Let me give you a clue.

[01:46:12.420 --> 01:46:12.920]
Not Kelly.

[01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:14.480]
Another squeaky voice.

[01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:16.140]
He was on this morning with Tony Cicarello.

[01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:16.580]
Yeah.

[01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:17.440]
No.

[01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:18.560]
Squeaky, I said.

[01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:19.220]
Not retarded.

[01:46:20.300 --> 01:46:20.540]
Ira?

[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:21.380]
Windbag.

[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:21.860]
That's it.

[01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:23.140]
Ira Windbag.

[01:46:23.260 --> 01:46:27.500]
The man who put the nails in the coffin of sports talk radio in South Florida.

[01:46:27.940 --> 01:46:28.600]
We are...

[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:29.960]
Ira, I read out.

[01:46:30.540 --> 01:46:31.040]
Aren't they two?

[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:32.120]
I don't even hear you.

[01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:32.140]
I'm sorry.

[01:46:32.380 --> 01:46:32.760]
I read out.

[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.360]
I guarantee Evan Coney going to have Ira Windbag all day.

[01:46:36.060 --> 01:46:37.160]
I know that.

[01:46:37.580 --> 01:46:41.280]
I wonder if a flea-felman and Mishmash are going to have Ira on her.

[01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:42.060]
I sure hope not tonight.

[01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:44.580]
I may be monitoring, so don't put that bastard on again.

[01:46:45.020 --> 01:46:45.520]
Thanks, Ira.

[01:46:45.940 --> 01:46:46.600]
Thanks for nothing.

[01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:47.460]
You loser.

[01:46:48.020 --> 01:46:52.880]
Lost supplies last saved hundreds of dollars off a seemingly parked-repeated striker, ultra-plug

[01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:54.880]
Euro pillow top only from Dallomatris.

[01:46:55.380 --> 01:46:58.300]
That's spelled S-T-R-Y-K-E-R just like Jeff Striker.

[01:46:59.020 --> 01:47:05.100]
As a matter of fact, speaking of Jeff Striker, it sounds like that, Mattris, need to be

[01:47:05.100 --> 01:47:06.040]
replacing, too, didn't it?

[01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:06.820]
What?

[01:47:06.900 --> 01:47:08.040]
What a little squeaky to me.

[01:47:08.340 --> 01:47:08.720]
A little bit.

[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:12.060]
For a limited time, take 400 bucks off a queen-set, just 699.

[01:47:12.620 --> 01:47:15.940]
Take 550 bucks off a king-set, similar savings in all sizes.

[01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:18.960]
Now, this isn't some cheapo, Mattris, that other stores promote their ads.

[01:47:19.140 --> 01:47:24.320]
This is a luxury, seagull-poster-peating-complete-with-memory-foam-and-premium-core-unit perfect for

[01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:25.140]
the master bedroom.

[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:28.000]
But this is a special limited-time offer, won't last forever.

[01:47:28.260 --> 01:47:32.260]
So call 1-800-Makres right now and find out more about the striker-matris.

[01:47:32.620 --> 01:47:34.720]
Maybe Jeff actually slept on it from Seagull.

[01:47:35.340 --> 01:47:36.940]
That's Jeff Striker, not Jeff for a high.

[01:47:36.940 --> 01:48:06.860]
Or ask about clearance pricing out of a seedly-poster-peating-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with-complete-with

[01:48:06.860 --> 01:48:20.260]
Because it stands for SCOOP-PENDIS-SAMING This is Neil Rogers, the fourth. This is 516-QK-SW-I-O-D-O-I-HAPE-AT station

[01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:37.880]
I got a reason why I feel so blue. I got a radio and nothing much to do. There ain't nobody who could wear these shoes. I've got the double-shoot-I-O-D-LOOZING

[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:55.200]
I don't care now. Do I have a wife? Rick Riley told me that I need to get a life. I need a tarman. Tell me what to do. I've got the double-shoot-I-O-D-LOOZING

[01:48:58.140 --> 01:49:01.860]
I don't think I ever played that before in my life. I can't remember that.

[01:49:01.860 --> 01:49:29.820]

[01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:38.420]
don't know. I don't know. I have no way. I don't know. I have no way. I have no life. I have no life. I have no life. So I know I have no life. So I know I have no life. So I know I have no life. So I know I have no life. So I know I have nothing to any use. So I have anything to do that to anything that the do that to good. Because because we have got ... because we got 6 and ... we got ... We got ... I got ... we got 6 and ... we got ... we got...

[01:49:38.420 --> 01:49:49.480]
Commencements call at a primary person villager sought out software. Commencements call at a primary person villager sought out software. Commencements call at a primary person villager sought out software too.

[01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:53.820]
Commencements call at a primary person villager sought out software. Commencements call at a primary person villager sought out software. Dream disabilities all the time.

[01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:57.120]
A jury deliberated almost two days before we did you talk about this?

[01:49:57.680 --> 01:49:58.420]
I mentioned it briefly.

[01:49:58.860 --> 01:50:00.360]
Oh, well I'll mention it again.

[01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:04.940]
A jury deliberated almost two days before convicting Curie Lee Kramer, 44 of aggravated

[01:50:04.940 --> 01:50:09.300]
sexual assault of a child, two counts of indecency with the child by contact, and one

[01:50:09.300 --> 01:50:11.200]
count of indecency with the child by exposure.

[01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:13.280]
It was clear to have nine other charges Tuesday.

[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.500]
He faces up to 149 years in prison.

[01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:21.220]
Kramer who now lives in Tucson, Arizona, gave national attention during the 2000 presidential

[01:50:21.220 --> 01:50:24.700]
election when his company created the end of the accusing administration of giving nuclear

[01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:27.740]
technology to China an exchange for campaign contributions.

[01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:33.320]
The spot was modeled after the infamous 1664 Daisy nuclear scare commercial and was pulled

[01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:35.580]
after a barrage of democratic criticism.

[01:50:36.060 --> 01:50:40.080]
Kramer who had been free on bonds since his 2005 arrest was taken into custody on a

[01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:41.700]
$4 million appeal bond after the verdict.

[01:50:42.220 --> 01:50:45.540]
Two girls accused Kramer of sexual assault allegedly had occurred in the past eight years.

[01:50:45.980 --> 01:50:49.500]
The fest attorney Charles Baker argued the allegations were invented by Kramer's ex-wife

[01:50:49.500 --> 01:50:51.180]
to help her case in a custody battle.

[01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:57.840]
And Coco Florida, the pastor of a rock ledge, church has been charged with raping a member

[01:50:57.840 --> 01:50:59.620]
of his congregation as being held up bond.

[01:51:00.500 --> 01:51:03.240]
Solid life ministries, I bet you he's rock solid.

[01:51:03.700 --> 01:51:08.620]
Solid life ministries pastor Jesse French, 43, was arrested on 10 counts of sexual

[01:51:08.620 --> 01:51:11.380]
battery and 15 counts of ludicrous conduct.

[01:51:11.700 --> 01:51:13.880]
I bet you Sally Fitz is curious about that sexual battery.

[01:51:15.300 --> 01:51:17.180]
Yeah, she figures maybe she lost that one.

[01:51:17.180 --> 01:51:21.760]
A 21-year-old Kramer, he told police that the pastor began abusing her about four months ago

[01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:24.300]
after telling her he needed to annoyed her with oil.

[01:51:24.780 --> 01:51:25.560]
Oh, that would they call it now?

[01:51:25.960 --> 01:51:26.380]
Yeah, annoying.

[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:27.800]
In the joint.

[01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:31.200]
That led to fondling and sex on ten occasions she said.

[01:51:31.540 --> 01:51:34.260]
The woman told investigators that she repeatedly tried to stop French,

[01:51:34.620 --> 01:51:38.760]
but that he would read the Bible tour and quote scripture to suggest that God wanted them to have

[01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:42.100]
sex, a port for maybe four to maybe was saying good God that's good.

[01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:46.140]
French was arrested June 22 and messaged life earliest today for French's attorney

[01:51:46.140 --> 01:51:47.700]
was not immediately returned.

[01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:52.120]
Coco Flora, that's almost as good as the guy that was doing his puppy up there in there.

[01:51:52.200 --> 01:51:52.520]
Where was that?

[01:51:52.860 --> 01:51:53.960]
That was some of the similar for you.

[01:51:54.200 --> 01:51:55.260]
Yeah, some red neck.

[01:51:55.260 --> 01:51:55.580]
Same thing.

[01:51:55.780 --> 01:51:56.360]
neck of the woods.

[01:51:56.920 --> 01:51:59.420]
You know, when you look at all the hosts that Dale Earhart's got in this pool,

[01:51:59.780 --> 01:52:03.300]
I'll tell you one thing though, first time we took this pool a few years ago,

[01:52:03.660 --> 01:52:05.260]
it's got to be at least three, four, five.

[01:52:06.060 --> 01:52:10.040]
We asked the same question and Dale Earhart, and this has to be a put on, didn't it?

[01:52:10.260 --> 01:52:11.540]
I think it was right after he died.

[01:52:12.180 --> 01:52:16.140]
He had 742 votes and the second place JFK had 209.

[01:52:16.280 --> 01:52:16.920]
Are you following that?

[01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:17.380]
Mm-hmm.

[01:52:17.540 --> 01:52:19.300]
He had 36.5% of all the hosts.

[01:52:19.620 --> 01:52:20.240]
They were in hard.

[01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:20.980]
What's that?

[01:52:21.340 --> 01:52:22.600]
Maybe all the red necks have left us.

[01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:23.460]
You think that's possible?

[01:52:23.560 --> 01:52:24.140]
We can only pray?

[01:52:24.680 --> 01:52:25.060]
God.

[01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:26.160]
Maybe they all died.

[01:52:26.480 --> 01:52:29.480]
Maybe they went to redneck heaven with who did Hillbilly heaven?

[01:52:30.040 --> 01:52:30.160]
Huh?

[01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:31.960]
Tex, uh, Texritor.

[01:52:32.140 --> 01:52:32.400]
Oh.

[01:52:32.900 --> 01:52:34.160]
Not sure if you remember that song, Hillbilly heaven.

[01:52:34.900 --> 01:52:36.840]
I dreamed I'd died with Hillbilly heaven.

[01:52:37.220 --> 01:52:38.460]
On Capitol Records, Texritor.

[01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:39.160]
I don't know.

[01:52:39.160 --> 01:52:39.880]
No, John Ritter.

[01:52:39.960 --> 01:52:40.920]
He was a Scott Ritter.

[01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:43.520]
Which public figure's death has affected you the most?

[01:52:43.720 --> 01:52:45.060]
I bet you were going to have over 700 votes

[01:52:45.060 --> 01:52:45.760]
by the top of the hour.

[01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:47.080]
We've got 644 right now.

[01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:47.900]
Well, maybe not.

[01:52:48.280 --> 01:52:51.000]
It's going to be a real battle right down to the wire for that A&R votes.

[01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:53.840]
And the reason we're not at our usual thousand up to stuff

[01:52:53.840 --> 01:52:56.420]
is because Eric Waddle wanted, I don't want to brawl beat Eric.

[01:52:56.540 --> 01:52:57.640]
He does a fine job for us.

[01:52:57.840 --> 01:52:58.580]
It's a labor of love.

[01:52:59.620 --> 01:53:00.980]
Any of you who's called it really is?

[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:01.860]
I give up.

[01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:02.380]
You're mine.

[01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:05.300]
Because if I would have just called him or even just emailed him last night,

[01:53:05.320 --> 01:53:07.260]
he'd say, hey, Eric, thanks for getting the new pull up.

[01:53:07.260 --> 01:53:08.140]
But it doesn't work sweetheart.

[01:53:08.440 --> 01:53:09.040]
Do something.

[01:53:09.180 --> 01:53:09.680]
Dittle with it.

[01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:10.680]
He would have dittle with it.

[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:12.020]
And he would have first the pull too.

[01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:15.700]
Once you get your blackberry, you can just text him on his cell phone.

[01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:18.300]
Maybe once I get my replacement blackberry for everyone that I lost.

[01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:21.540]
At least they're sending me the new model now, the 8700 series.

[01:53:21.660 --> 01:53:22.160]
Oh, the new one?

[01:53:22.340 --> 01:53:23.120]
Is that the ankleberry?

[01:53:23.320 --> 01:53:24.220]
The one that fits right up your ass?

[01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:25.140]
It's the dangleberry.

[01:53:25.340 --> 01:53:26.600]
In fact, you know who invented it?

[01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:27.460]
Dory, dory, dory.

[01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:27.760]
No.

[01:53:28.120 --> 01:53:30.820]
That's what he was actually when he was reaching down his pants like that.

[01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:33.660]
He was always just sending a message to our Garcia or somebody.

[01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:36.720]
He was probably Jeff Garcia.

[01:53:37.840 --> 01:53:39.040]
Nobody wants fresh breath?

[01:53:39.940 --> 01:53:42.580]
You know, I was thinking about that before the show today.

[01:53:42.700 --> 01:53:46.040]
Back in the day when we had all the hot naked pictures on our website.

[01:53:46.820 --> 01:53:47.700]
And what was her name?

[01:53:47.900 --> 01:53:48.300]
You would remember.

[01:53:48.740 --> 01:53:49.000]
I will.

[01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:49.500]
Give me a hit.

[01:53:49.820 --> 01:53:50.700]
Carmella, this is her.

[01:53:50.920 --> 01:53:51.760]
And say I knew it.

[01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:52.800]
Carmella, this is her.

[01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:54.980]
She was about as pristine and clean as it can get.

[01:53:55.480 --> 01:53:58.980]
And he allegedly was like, she was his girlfriend, Jeff Garcia.

[01:53:59.460 --> 01:53:59.600]
Yes.

[01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:00.540]
That's what I heard.

[01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:02.040]
So, wow.

[01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:03.380]
So don't believe everything you hear.

[01:54:03.800 --> 01:54:04.780]
Anybody bring any gum?

[01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:06.020]
Nobody wants fresh breath?

[01:54:06.020 --> 01:54:08.220]
See, Joshua, you know that because you've seen that right?

[01:54:08.320 --> 01:54:11.180]
I mean, in time, oh, have a, it's just, it just makes you,

[01:54:11.300 --> 01:54:12.560]
even the way to laugh or cry.

[01:54:13.100 --> 01:54:13.820]
I'll choose cry.

[01:54:14.600 --> 01:54:15.820]
6655 makes me want to cry.

[01:54:16.140 --> 01:54:17.900]
652 is kind of like those pride parades.

[01:54:17.940 --> 01:54:21.080]
Makes me want to cry or just hide in the room, go back in the room closet.

[01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:24.280]
But I don't want to spend any time in every Tommy Cruz or John Robolta.

[01:54:24.620 --> 01:54:25.540]
And serving that with our Kelly.

[01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:31.800]
JFK 174, John Lennon 78, Dale Earnhardt has fallen mightily.

[01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:33.540]
He's only got 53 in this time around.

[01:54:33.820 --> 01:54:35.780]
6.1%, or 8.1%.

[01:54:36.020 --> 01:54:40.500]
Phil Harbin 38, Bob Weaver 26, Rest in Peace, John Balushi 23,

[01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:47.320]
Princess Diana 23, Kirk Cobain 19, Bobby Kennedy 16, Jeff Garcia, I mean,

[01:54:47.420 --> 01:54:55.380]
Jerry Garcia, while you're in T. Jeff Garcia, you could probably sing just as well.

[01:54:55.600 --> 01:54:56.400]
I never saw it together.

[01:54:56.800 --> 01:54:58.320]
Yeah, and probably has fresh or breath.

[01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:02.780]
Jerry Garcia 14, Martin Luther King 14,

[01:55:03.940 --> 01:55:08.000]
JFK Jr. 12, Johnny Carson 10, Elvis Presley 10.

[01:55:08.300 --> 01:55:11.540]
They're taking these polls now with his skeleton audience we got.

[01:55:11.940 --> 01:55:13.820]
He's like starting into a gigantic hurricane.

[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:17.560]
Jim Morrison 9, Freddie Mercury 8, Jim Hanson 8,

[01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:20.740]
Harry 37, Jackie Gleason 6, Chris Farley 6,

[01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:24.240]
Roddy Dingerfield 6, Conor Rest Thompson 6, Nipsy Russell 5,

[01:55:24.420 --> 01:55:26.120]
so many dead celebrities, so little time.

[01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:29.620]
Johnny Cash 4, Ronnie Reagan 4, Marlon Brando only 4,

[01:55:29.620 --> 01:55:34.840]
Pope John Paul the tooth head 4, Lucie 4, Charles Schultz 4, John Wayne 4,

[01:55:35.340 --> 01:55:40.100]
and Bishop 3, Carol O'Connor 3, Ray Charles 3, Richard Pryor 3, Sinatra 3,

[01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:45.360]
2 for Dr. Edward Teller, Fred Rogers, Robert Stack, John Ritter, Bob Keaton,

[01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:49.360]
Christopher Reeve, and VanCraw Peter Jennings Don Nott's,

[01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:52.300]
Nirleman Roe and one already for none of the above, see I told you.

[01:55:52.820 --> 01:55:55.860]
For example, Aaron Spelling, Jack Lemmon, LeMone, G. Rayburn,

[01:55:55.860 --> 01:55:59.900]
Ralph Redneck, Tony Randall, Isabelle Sanford, Rick James,

[01:56:00.580 --> 01:56:02.840]
they all got one and then I'm not going to go any further.

[01:56:03.020 --> 01:56:03.780]
How about the ones with none?

[01:56:04.240 --> 01:56:06.500]
With zero, nobody cares about Bobby Barnes.

[01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:08.400]
You know, how about word bonds?

[01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:09.000]
Who?

[01:56:09.460 --> 01:56:10.580]
How about Gary U.S. Barnes?

[01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:12.400]
I hate this pool don't have any yet.

[01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:15.580]
Morris Gibb, none, zero for Dr. Bob, Jimmy Stewart,

[01:56:15.820 --> 01:56:18.240]
Katherine Hepburn, Buddy Hackett, Bob Hope, Gary Bond.

[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:19.180]
How about what's his name?

[01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:20.800]
Spencer Tracy, you know he's always on these pool.

[01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:22.580]
Let's stick his old ugly ass on there.

[01:56:22.700 --> 01:56:24.800]
Spencer Tracy, who'd you like better?

[01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:26.140]
Spencer Tracy or Dick Tracy?

[01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:28.160]
Like Spencer the car wash guy.

[01:56:28.660 --> 01:56:30.920]
Well, I preferred the car too myself.

[01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:35.400]
1242-18-1-A-Q-A-M Evan Cohen at 2 this afternoon

[01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:37.400]
and at 2-4-That Mystery Slod.

[01:56:38.140 --> 01:56:41.480]
Never heard of him in my life and already I'm thinking it's going to be a gigantic improvement.

[01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:43.980]
If you think you might have termites in your home,

[01:56:44.140 --> 01:56:45.340]
why not do this smart thing right now?

[01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:47.860]
Right in the middle, it's about a month and two,

[01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:48.840]
hurricane season.

[01:56:49.140 --> 01:56:50.620]

[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.660]
So call our friends at Rida Peskin's hole today and get it you a free

[01:56:53.660 --> 01:56:54.660]

There is absolutely no obligation that they can you lost your house yet or what?

[01:56:58.740 --> 01:56:59.060]
No, not yet.

[01:56:59.420 --> 01:57:00.160]
They're doing it.

[01:57:00.220 --> 01:57:00.460]
They're doing it.

[01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:02.400]
Rida Peskin's hole uses that amazing orange hole,

[01:57:02.540 --> 01:57:04.860]
a treatment that kills termites and the right is 100% on contact.

[01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:07.760]
They're going fast and you can say where is Troy Stradford?

[01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:10.260]
By the way, if anybody finds Troy Stradford, call a police.

[01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:13.320]
If you have termites, this is the best possible way to get rid of them.

[01:57:13.320 --> 01:57:15.780]
You don't have to tense your house and make a circus in your neighborhood.

[01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:17.340]
No worry about poisonous gas.

[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:21.320]
No moving out and staying in hotels or motels for days or weeks at a time.

[01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:23.660]
You don't have to worry about the food or your pets in your health

[01:57:23.660 --> 01:57:27.340]
because the folks at Rida Peskin's hole use this amazing orange oil

[01:57:27.340 --> 01:57:28.880]
and they don't have to leave it all.

[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:30.240]
In fact, when they're on treating your property,

[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:33.220]
the only thing left behind is the clean set of oranges for just a few days.

[01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:37.320]
So if you have a termite problem or think you might have one in the works,

[01:57:37.660 --> 01:57:38.260]
nip it in the bud.

[01:57:38.580 --> 01:57:41.460]

[01:57:41.460 --> 01:57:44.980]
orange hole treatment that kills termites and their eggs 100% on contact.

[01:57:45.200 --> 01:57:47.500]
No tending, they just do a fabulous job every time.

[01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:49.940]

That's 1-800-447-4348.

[01:57:56.620 --> 01:57:58.180]
And when you call, be sure and tell them the Todd Dreck.

[01:57:58.620 --> 01:57:58.980]
Tore the call.

[01:57:59.240 --> 01:58:00.000]
Hey, you're next Todd.

[01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:03.860]
1-800-447-4348.

[01:58:04.140 --> 01:58:06.360]
This is Neil Roger.

[01:58:06.660 --> 01:58:07.800]
What's all it means?

[01:58:08.220 --> 01:58:10.380]
Is 5.62-8.

[01:58:12.040 --> 01:58:12.620]
Hey.

[01:58:12.620 --> 01:58:12.800]
Hey.

[01:58:13.240 --> 01:58:13.520]
Hey.

[01:58:13.900 --> 01:58:14.300]
Hey.

[01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:14.640]

[01:58:15.220 --> 01:58:15.800]
Hey.

[01:58:15.800 --> 01:58:15.800]

[01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:17.720]
It's the concert of the summer.

[01:58:18.020 --> 01:58:18.820]
William Hone.

[01:58:18.820 --> 01:58:20.060]
And Connie Chong.

[01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:22.020]
Hone and Chong together.

[01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:22.840]
Choke.

[01:58:23.520 --> 01:58:24.320]
Choke.

[01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:26.440]
Choke.

[01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:27.340]
Choke.

[01:58:27.340 --> 01:58:27.520]
Choke.

[01:58:27.520 --> 01:58:27.540]
Choke.

[01:58:27.740 --> 01:58:27.740]

[01:58:28.820 --> 01:58:34.780]
All the memories that you know that they're showing through.

[01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:38.200]
I got bigger things to do.

[01:58:38.740 --> 01:58:46.160]
But worried that William and that baby's how to bow your ears will bleed.

[01:58:46.500 --> 01:58:48.340]
So if not, just you'll have a stroke.

[01:58:50.100 --> 01:58:50.720]
William Hone.

[01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:52.060]
For the memory.

[01:58:53.180 --> 01:58:53.660]
William Hone.

[01:58:53.900 --> 01:58:54.900]
And Connie Chong.

[01:58:55.300 --> 01:58:55.800]
Hone and Chong.

[01:58:56.080 --> 01:58:56.640]
Voluzas.

[01:58:57.060 --> 01:58:57.320]
Perfect.

[01:58:57.900 --> 01:58:58.320]
Too bad.

[01:58:59.020 --> 01:59:01.220]
All the baby's how to bow your ears.

[01:59:01.260 --> 01:59:01.640]
Too bad.

[01:59:02.020 --> 01:59:03.720]
We promise thanks for the first 100 people.

[01:59:04.340 --> 01:59:07.220]
1247 at 560 W.A.K.Y.M.

[01:59:07.660 --> 01:59:11.240]
Telling viewers that Bill O'Reilly misrepresented viewers statistics Keith Overman,

[01:59:11.380 --> 01:59:12.000]
one of our favorites,

[01:59:12.520 --> 01:59:14.700]
anchor of Countdown with Keith Overman at MSNBC,

[01:59:15.120 --> 01:59:17.900]
explained that his audience has grown 37%.

[01:59:17.900 --> 01:59:21.040]
While the O'Reilly factors has dropped 20% in the same period.

[01:59:21.560 --> 01:59:23.820]
Fox's ratings are lower than they were five years ago.

[01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:28.080]
Bill O 267,000 of the United Viewers of Vanishing's last June,

[01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:31.700]
call Fox Security they are missing Overman said, as only he can.

[01:59:32.160 --> 01:59:34.980]
Overman also speaks of dropping viewer numbers for the other Fox shows,

[01:59:35.240 --> 01:59:40.740]
all 11 of Fox's regular shows ratings are down for them are down by 15% or more he notes.

[01:59:41.220 --> 01:59:42.960]
Of course he doesn't mention the facial MSNBC,

[01:59:43.380 --> 01:59:46.320]
don't have any numbers other than his show and maybe maybe a little hard balls

[01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:48.180]
and that they're changing everything over there.

[01:59:48.600 --> 01:59:49.760]
But they have read across me.

[01:59:51.100 --> 01:59:52.940]
How much MSNBC seriously?

[01:59:53.480 --> 01:59:54.100]
How much do I?

[01:59:54.560 --> 01:59:54.700]
Yes.

[01:59:55.680 --> 01:59:55.920]
None.

[01:59:56.600 --> 01:59:57.420]
You know what's Keith?

[01:59:57.980 --> 01:59:58.300]
Well that.

[01:59:58.860 --> 01:59:59.920]
But I just started that.

[01:59:59.920 --> 02:00:02.640]
Uh oh, don't worry, Over, expect to the question about flood stage,

[02:00:02.640 --> 02:00:05.040]
the new home Pennsylvania, that's on MSNBC right now.

[02:00:05.460 --> 02:00:07.720]
You know, everybody came out yesterday and helped.

[02:00:07.820 --> 02:00:08.600]
What's he laughing about?

[02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:09.000]

[02:00:09.780 --> 02:00:13.120]
That's the amount of people that is helping and everybody is trying to stay positive.

[02:00:13.460 --> 02:00:14.560]
It's the perfect place to live.

[02:00:15.060 --> 02:00:19.440]
It's beautiful here and something that's going to happen and it's not supposed to be but.

[02:00:19.860 --> 02:00:21.480]
Yeah, you guys, you're on swimming pool just to walk,

[02:00:21.700 --> 02:00:25.260]
sit right off the porch and you're on swimming pool right there kind of

[02:00:25.260 --> 02:00:26.980]
brown, dirty, muddy water though.

[02:00:27.120 --> 02:00:28.600]
It looks like those canals and I'm still dumb.

[02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:31.820]
You know, look at that on MSNBC, that really brown water.

[02:00:32.040 --> 02:00:34.020]
Oh, that must be the mud, isn't it?

[02:00:34.180 --> 02:00:34.900]
That's right, that's what it is.

[02:00:34.920 --> 02:00:37.840]
I sure hope, maybe the cat again, you know, if your cat starts acting up,

[02:00:37.980 --> 02:00:38.820]
go and set off.

[02:00:39.360 --> 02:00:42.000]
That's a good lesson for all your kids out there and you will not go to the slamer

[02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:43.460]
because the courts have already decided.

[02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:44.480]
As you already ruled,

[02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:47.040]
hey, if your cat's like ill and I can real anti-social,

[02:00:47.380 --> 02:00:48.520]
but I'm being, right?

[02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:49.040]

[02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:53.240]
684 votes, man, we got 11 minutes to get up to 700 by the top of the air

[02:00:53.240 --> 02:00:55.160]
and then the sky's the limit after that.

[02:00:55.640 --> 02:00:59.120]
Jet blue, known for its swank seats and I never flown jet blue, have you?

[02:00:59.460 --> 02:01:00.680]
No, I don't think so.

[02:01:01.100 --> 02:01:03.360]
You know what the problem is, all these new fangirl little airlines

[02:01:04.240 --> 02:01:06.020]
that get all the great red-ups like Southwest,

[02:01:06.460 --> 02:01:07.960]
they don't go anywhere that I want to go.

[02:01:08.660 --> 02:01:11.980]
Like Southwest, I mean, it gets nothing but fantastic reviews.

[02:01:12.380 --> 02:01:15.860]
The only problem is like, for example, if you want to fly from Fort Lauderdale to LA,

[02:01:16.060 --> 02:01:18.180]
this is, it takes like 18 different flights.

[02:01:19.100 --> 02:01:22.120]
Jet blue, known for its swank seats and individual passenger TVs,

[02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:23.780]
range-sized among low-cost carriers,

[02:01:24.220 --> 02:01:26.640]
and customer satisfaction as a survey released today.

[02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:29.380]
Jet blue received stellar numbers across the board,

[02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:32.360]
topping the ratings in all seven customer satisfaction categories.

[02:01:32.960 --> 02:01:35.160]
Findings from the study by JD Power Associates

[02:01:35.160 --> 02:01:37.720]
and Aviation Week Magazine are based on responses

[02:01:37.720 --> 02:01:40.920]
from over 9,000 passengers who flew on a major North American airline

[02:01:40.920 --> 02:01:42.340]
this year between January and May.

[02:01:42.940 --> 02:01:45.000]
You know what the best North American airline is for my money?

[02:01:45.360 --> 02:01:45.760]
I give up.

[02:01:46.060 --> 02:01:47.120]
Air Canada, okay?

[02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:48.820]
Not even close.

[02:01:49.820 --> 02:01:53.580]
Overall customer satisfaction with both low-cost and traditional multi-caven curers

[02:01:53.580 --> 02:01:57.140]
was measured by seven factors in order of importance cost and fees,

[02:01:57.420 --> 02:01:58.760]
while the Air Canada is not rated on that,

[02:01:58.840 --> 02:02:00.060]
they soak in armen five legs.

[02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:01.340]
It's called monopoly.

[02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:03.780]
Quality of flight crewing, including courtesy and appearance,

[02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:06.420]
in flight services such as the availability of food and beverages,

[02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:07.380]
ease of check.

[02:02:07.660 --> 02:02:08.180]
Oh, you know something?

[02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:11.620]
I told you about the horn this flight I had back from Amsterdam to Toronto.

[02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:12.960]
The horn, the flight.

[02:02:13.580 --> 02:02:14.320]
The horn, the flight.

[02:02:14.620 --> 02:02:16.340]
So anyway, what do they call them?

[02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:17.100]
The perser.

[02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:17.960]
Okay.

[02:02:18.040 --> 02:02:20.980]
So she came by and of course, they, you know, and obviously I told her

[02:02:20.980 --> 02:02:22.700]
that I fly a KLM a hell of a lot.

[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:24.420]
I spent a ton of money on her airline.

[02:02:24.940 --> 02:02:27.680]
And so I didn't order the meal because the food there is like from a hunger

[02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:28.360]
machine on a bar.

[02:02:28.500 --> 02:02:31.300]
And so she made me a toasted ham and cheese sandwich.

[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:32.180]
She had it made special.

[02:02:32.340 --> 02:02:32.700]
Really?

[02:02:33.140 --> 02:02:33.940]
And it was damn good.

[02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:36.700]
I keep asking myself this question.

[02:02:37.160 --> 02:02:37.480]
Why?

[02:02:37.700 --> 02:02:38.600]
I've asked this for many years.

[02:02:38.820 --> 02:02:41.460]
Instead of trying to be gourmet chefs because the food on most airlines

[02:02:41.460 --> 02:02:42.480]
is absolutely blows.

[02:02:42.980 --> 02:02:44.620]
Why not make things available like that?

[02:02:45.220 --> 02:02:46.080]
That's a great idea.

[02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:49.060]
Why not have it catered by people who make like substands,

[02:02:49.060 --> 02:02:50.900]
which is a right, it doesn't even have to be hot.

[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:51.320]
Right?

[02:02:51.420 --> 02:02:52.480]
There's just a belly stuff there.

[02:02:52.580 --> 02:02:52.880]
Yeah.

[02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:54.500]
Wouldn't that be fantastic?

[02:02:54.800 --> 02:02:55.120]
Yeah, what?

[02:02:55.600 --> 02:02:58.180]
As opposed to Chef Schmendrick who put together the beef floor

[02:02:58.180 --> 02:03:00.200]
on the whole with the, uh, the microwave.

[02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:02.340]
The little potatoes and, oh, good.

[02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:03.860]
So glorified TV dinners, what is it?

[02:03:03.860 --> 02:03:04.560]
It's horrible.

[02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:06.000]
It is just awful.

[02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:09.940]
The study finds that process factors such as check in, how pastures

[02:03:09.940 --> 02:03:12.700]
boarded plane, how baggage delivered at the destination and people factors,

[02:03:13.100 --> 02:03:15.520]
such as hiring the right people and training and enabling them to be

[02:03:15.520 --> 02:03:18.600]
successful are what differentiate carriers in the eyes of passengers.

[02:03:19.140 --> 02:03:22.140]
Yet, the Lewis court, a one-ponsed appoints above the average for low-cost

[02:03:22.140 --> 02:03:24.280]
carriers with an overall satisfaction index,

[02:03:24.460 --> 02:03:26.460]
who are up to 820 out of a possible 1,000.

[02:03:26.820 --> 02:03:30.920]
Southwest airlines was a distance second and frontier airlines was at the

[02:03:30.920 --> 02:03:31.300]
bottom.

[02:03:31.800 --> 02:03:32.520]
Did we hear Frontier?

[02:03:32.880 --> 02:03:33.040]
Yeah.

[02:03:33.560 --> 02:03:34.920]
I've flown Frontier actually.

[02:03:35.240 --> 02:03:38.380]
And they are, uh, they're a, like, local puddle jumping

[02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:39.920]
airline in the northwest.

[02:03:40.420 --> 02:03:42.180]
That's how you have to get to Montana from Denver.

[02:03:42.540 --> 02:03:43.020]
I'll be damned.

[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:44.520]
Why don't we go to either one of those places?

[02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:47.900]
Among the multi-cannon airlines, continental airlines was the highest

[02:03:47.900 --> 02:03:50.240]
rated carrier, excelling in check-ins,

[02:03:50.540 --> 02:03:52.380]
in-flight service and cost in fee factors.

[02:03:52.780 --> 02:03:54.840]
Delta was a close second and American airlines was stirred.

[02:03:55.220 --> 02:03:57.440]
Air Canada was last among traditional carriers.

[02:03:57.900 --> 02:03:58.000]
Huh.

[02:03:58.500 --> 02:03:59.100]
How do you like that?

[02:03:59.180 --> 02:03:59.340]
Good.

[02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:00.560]
Could you fly American?

[02:04:01.320 --> 02:04:04.220]
You fly the terrorist airline of choice and I'll stick with their

[02:04:04.220 --> 02:04:04.480]
Canada.

[02:04:04.620 --> 02:04:04.940]
Thank you.

[02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:05.800]
We've got a terrorist.

[02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:06.460]
Yes.

[02:04:06.860 --> 02:04:09.620]
I think it wasn't JetBlue the first one to install those bulletproof doors

[02:04:09.620 --> 02:04:10.880]
right after 9-11.

[02:04:11.160 --> 02:04:11.820]
I have no idea.

[02:04:12.040 --> 02:04:12.340]
I think so.

[02:04:12.340 --> 02:04:15.060]
Well, the big thing about JetBlue is, uh, everybody gets their own TV

[02:04:15.060 --> 02:04:16.000]
in the back of the seat.

[02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:17.240]
That's great.

[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:20.140]
This fax that you just sent me, and by the way, it is your machine because

[02:04:20.140 --> 02:04:22.640]
I tested, I made a copy of something on my machine.

[02:04:22.900 --> 02:04:23.100]
Okay.

[02:04:23.520 --> 02:04:24.580]
And there's no lines down the middle.

[02:04:24.780 --> 02:04:26.220]
So as usual, it's on your ass end.

[02:04:26.680 --> 02:04:27.560]
Don't feel bad about it.

[02:04:27.620 --> 02:04:29.080]
Just investigate between now and next Thursday.

[02:04:29.540 --> 02:04:29.760]
Okay.

[02:04:30.300 --> 02:04:32.900]
Maybe you need a new toner cartridge or whatever, whatever you've got.

[02:04:33.040 --> 02:04:34.040]
I'm going to get a two-toner cartridge.

[02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:36.180]
Somebody says the bird, Glen Hill.

[02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:37.520]
And just, you know, like he,

[02:04:37.920 --> 02:04:38.900]
published in his death.

[02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:40.740]
You want to put him on their hand can I get any votes?

[02:04:41.180 --> 02:04:41.900]
No, I don't care.

[02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:43.860]
Kind of silly.

[02:04:51.800 --> 02:04:54.580]
Anyway, what were you talking about with Jim Scowler as a crazy person?

[02:04:54.700 --> 02:04:55.720]
There must have been more of that.

[02:04:55.820 --> 02:04:57.580]
You said that like, uh, I don't know if I can do it.

[02:04:57.580 --> 02:04:58.240]
I thought you knew.

[02:04:58.580 --> 02:05:00.320]
I said, I really, no matter what I said.

[02:05:00.420 --> 02:05:01.080]
Well, what does that mean?

[02:05:01.340 --> 02:05:03.980]
How many, um, I mean, in this business,

[02:05:03.980 --> 02:05:05.400]
how much of the right to know you had with him?

[02:05:05.780 --> 02:05:08.080]
How many times have you been in person with him?

[02:05:08.360 --> 02:05:10.340]
Maybe a couple of times in my whole life.

[02:05:10.340 --> 02:05:11.180]
Me too.

[02:05:11.320 --> 02:05:12.100]
That's all it took for me.

[02:05:12.480 --> 02:05:12.800]
Really?

[02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:13.120]
Yeah.

[02:05:13.560 --> 02:05:14.820]
I never knew it was really him.

[02:05:14.980 --> 02:05:15.840]
I mean, I spent some time.

[02:05:15.980 --> 02:05:17.520]
I always confused him with Bill Zimper.

[02:05:17.820 --> 02:05:19.680]
Because I saw the two of them so infrequently.

[02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:20.120]
Okay.

[02:05:20.220 --> 02:05:20.900]
And it would show up.

[02:05:20.920 --> 02:05:24.100]
I think, hey, I didn't see there's nothing worse than when somebody shows up

[02:05:24.100 --> 02:05:26.300]
and you don't know for sure who it is because you don't know who it is.

[02:05:26.300 --> 02:05:26.460]
Oh, yeah.

[02:05:26.900 --> 02:05:27.660]
Hey, I have Bill.

[02:05:27.800 --> 02:05:28.100]
How you know?

[02:05:28.200 --> 02:05:28.680]
I'm not Bill.

[02:05:28.840 --> 02:05:30.100]
I'm, uh, Jim Scowler.

[02:05:30.180 --> 02:05:32.300]
Oh, you know, so I just say,

[02:05:32.300 --> 02:05:33.060]
how you doing?

[02:05:33.180 --> 02:05:34.100]
You know, whoever you are.

[02:05:34.420 --> 02:05:35.700]
Why is he a crazy person?

[02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:37.420]
Or is it just, I don't know why he's a crazy person.

[02:05:37.520 --> 02:05:37.880]
He just is.

[02:05:37.880 --> 02:05:38.940]
He's an armed, laughing spaz.

[02:05:39.580 --> 02:05:39.860]
Yeah.

[02:05:40.460 --> 02:05:40.980]
Hahaha.

[02:05:42.320 --> 02:05:42.840]
Hahaha.

[02:05:44.360 --> 02:05:45.040]
What's that?

[02:05:45.220 --> 02:05:45.560]
Oh, yeah.

[02:05:45.720 --> 02:05:46.180]
Here's one.

[02:05:50.780 --> 02:05:52.600]
Everyone, I grow up.

[02:05:52.800 --> 02:05:56.200]
I want to be just like Jim Scowler with a $30.

[02:05:56.480 --> 02:05:57.220]
He's a T.

[02:05:57.780 --> 02:05:58.460]
Not a T.

[02:05:58.760 --> 02:06:00.300]
I wouldn't need his body.

[02:06:00.620 --> 02:06:01.380]
And fancy that.

[02:06:01.580 --> 02:06:02.620]
We're a confuse there.

[02:06:02.960 --> 02:06:05.460]
A microphone and a thick will be you.

[02:06:06.100 --> 02:06:08.980]
He's a slipper like Pokefrying

[02:06:09.540 --> 02:06:13.020]
as battery equipment but even sound.

[02:06:13.740 --> 02:06:15.580]
Oh, when I grow up,

[02:06:15.900 --> 02:06:17.940]
I want to be just like Jim Scowler

[02:06:17.940 --> 02:06:20.260]
then I wouldn't have to spend my day.

[02:06:20.560 --> 02:06:21.880]
Here comes my cello.

[02:06:22.160 --> 02:06:24.200]
I wouldn't have to spend my day.

[02:06:25.560 --> 02:06:28.180]
I think that sounds just fine.

[02:06:29.860 --> 02:06:32.280]
This is Neil Rogers.

[02:06:33.180 --> 02:06:34.600]
This is 5.

[02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:35.080]
16.

[02:06:35.580 --> 02:06:36.060]
8.

[02:06:37.980 --> 02:06:39.000]
Okay, 12.59.

[02:06:39.160 --> 02:06:41.600]
The obvious question that everybody in South Florida is asking

[02:06:41.600 --> 02:06:43.460]
on the Troy Stradford show up dead or alive?

[02:06:43.860 --> 02:06:44.080]
No.

[02:06:44.520 --> 02:06:45.240]
He's still a wall?

[02:06:45.680 --> 02:06:45.980]
Yes.

[02:06:46.320 --> 02:06:47.720]
Well, I usually bail him out.

[02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000]
Hell, your horse racing fans and poker players,

[02:06:50.220 --> 02:06:51.480]
Pompadopark Racing and Poker,

[02:06:51.780 --> 02:06:53.240]
has got all the plunging action you want

[02:06:53.240 --> 02:06:55.340]
and will also feature a great free

[02:06:55.340 --> 02:06:57.540]
fireworks show this Saturday, July 1st.

[02:06:57.780 --> 02:06:59.220]
In addition to the fireworks show Saturday,

[02:06:59.420 --> 02:07:00.920]
after the last race at 10.30 PM,

[02:07:00.920 --> 02:07:02.920]
you can win one of 10 raffle tickets

[02:07:02.920 --> 02:07:06.000]
for the $60,000 one of a kind Marlon's

[02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:07.520]
Chaffer motorcycle will be on display.

[02:07:07.840 --> 02:07:09.940]
Each raffle ticket comes with two game day tickets

[02:07:09.940 --> 02:07:12.320]
to see those Red Hot Marlon's baseball team.

[02:07:12.820 --> 02:07:14.640]
Plus for the kids, there'll be a free miniature horse ride,

[02:07:15.100 --> 02:07:17.000]
free face painting and a free caricature artist

[02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:18.260]
starting at 7.30 in the PM.

[02:07:18.760 --> 02:07:20.420]
Located just to half mile from both I-95

[02:07:20.420 --> 02:07:22.600]
and the turn pipe Pompadopark is easy to get to

[02:07:22.600 --> 02:07:25.220]
and best of all, Pompadopark gives you free admission

[02:07:25.220 --> 02:07:27.340]
and free general parking every day.

[02:07:27.780 --> 02:07:29.560]
Live harness racing with great smoke free poker room

[02:07:29.560 --> 02:07:31.020]
for the winter Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.

[02:07:31.420 --> 02:07:33.320]
Poker gets underway at noon, goes on to midnight

[02:07:33.320 --> 02:07:36.040]
and live racing gets underway at 7.25 in the PM.

[02:07:36.240 --> 02:07:37.300]
Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.

[02:07:37.580 --> 02:07:39.520]
Don't miss out on dollar night on Wednesdays at the track.

[02:07:39.860 --> 02:07:41.300]
That's when draft beer soda hot dogs

[02:07:41.300 --> 02:07:42.520]
and lots more just a bucket piece,

[02:07:42.540 --> 02:07:43.760]
starting at 6.00 in the PM.

[02:07:44.180 --> 02:07:45.600]
Don't forget the big free fireworks show

[02:07:45.600 --> 02:07:47.920]
this Saturday, July 1 at Pompadopark,

[02:07:48.060 --> 02:07:49.800]
a block south of Atlantic Boulevard on Powerline Road

[02:07:49.800 --> 02:07:54.120]
for the current racing schedule call 954-972-2000.

[02:07:54.560 --> 02:07:55.760]
Be sure and tell them that Troy Stryford

[02:07:55.760 --> 02:07:57.380]
told you to call around the wicked web,

[02:07:57.460 --> 02:07:58.740]
it's Pompadopark.com.

[02:07:58.740 --> 02:08:01.920]
Oh no, this is on, this is not a tumor.

[02:08:02.200 --> 02:08:03.920]
It's the one to two hour.

[02:08:09.320 --> 02:08:09.920]
Pompadopark, a block south of Atlantic Boulevard on Powerline Road

[02:08:09.920 --> 02:08:12.740]
This is Dan Rennett for one of the final times

[02:08:12.740 --> 02:08:14.820]
reporting for CBS News.

[02:08:15.320 --> 02:08:18.220]
You may have heard that I will be leaving the network

[02:08:18.220 --> 02:08:21.500]
for which I served as news anchor for 24 years.

[02:08:22.060 --> 02:08:26.420]
CBS has basically told me there is no future for me there.

[02:08:27.100 --> 02:08:30.100]
Well, wipe the dog poo off my shoe and call me red butt.

[02:08:30.580 --> 02:08:33.280]
No future for me, no future for me.

[02:08:33.960 --> 02:08:36.160]
This from a network that hired a party girl

[02:08:36.160 --> 02:08:37.220]
to be their news anchor.

[02:08:37.860 --> 02:08:40.120]
I say belonging to users, belonging.

[02:08:40.860 --> 02:08:43.120]
This Katy Persons ranks cheap champagne

[02:08:43.120 --> 02:08:46.160]
out of her stilettos while tabletop dancing

[02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:48.620]
and belting out karaoke, which I'm told

[02:08:48.620 --> 02:08:50.960]
is a Japanese-impliant singing style.

[02:08:51.620 --> 02:08:54.640]
No future for me, I have been the face of that dump

[02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:56.080]
for more than three decades.

[02:08:56.560 --> 02:09:00.720]
Long before Survivor, CSI, or the Monday Night Comedy Block,

[02:09:01.140 --> 02:09:03.380]
which actually blows, I was the king.

[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.820]
Yet they have the audacity, the unmitigated goal

[02:09:06.820 --> 02:09:10.680]
to tell me there is no future with them, no future for me.

[02:09:11.240 --> 02:09:12.940]
You make up a couple of stories about the president,

[02:09:13.160 --> 02:09:14.580]
suddenly your persona non-grata.

[02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:16.440]
How about that long-haired freak we have

[02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:18.140]
in the radio division for all those years?

[02:09:18.600 --> 02:09:20.860]
They rewarded him by sending him to a company

[02:09:20.860 --> 02:09:23.200]
where the councils have their own radio show.

[02:09:23.200 --> 02:09:25.960]
If you ask me, that's not too much vision

[02:09:25.960 --> 02:09:28.120]
for a company with an eyeball for a logo.

[02:09:28.640 --> 02:09:31.500]
Who could even believe that I, the great-damn rather,

[02:09:31.920 --> 02:09:34.220]
would become a body's uselessest boobs on a bowl?

[02:09:34.860 --> 02:09:37.400]
I guess the only way to ensure your future with this network

[02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:39.540]
is to cover oneself with body glitter

[02:09:39.540 --> 02:09:41.420]
and sleep with less moonbears.

[02:09:41.720 --> 02:09:46.280]
For the record I tried, less, was less than receptive.

[02:09:46.740 --> 02:09:48.520]
I have been forced to consider offers

[02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:50.180]
that quite frankly are beneath me.

[02:09:50.180 --> 02:09:52.880]
For example, a hosting job on the show

[02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:54.060]
so you think you can dance

[02:09:54.580 --> 02:09:56.220]
and a new reality show called

[02:09:56.220 --> 02:09:58.580]
Milking Cows with Celebrities.

[02:09:58.840 --> 02:10:00.400]
This reporter has rubbed shoulders

[02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:02.500]
with the greatest newsmakers of our time.

[02:10:02.880 --> 02:10:05.520]
Gorbachev, Brazilians, Heidi Plyce,

[02:10:06.020 --> 02:10:07.920]
and now I'm going on casting calls

[02:10:07.920 --> 02:10:09.940]
with Screech from Saved by the Bell

[02:10:09.940 --> 02:10:12.640]
whose own hold was in foreclosure road.

[02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:15.540]
Well, fire my skillet and rap me a bacon.

[02:10:16.120 --> 02:10:17.500]
I won't take it laying down

[02:10:17.500 --> 02:10:20.300]
unless of course less moonbears reconsideres.

[02:10:20.540 --> 02:10:24.360]
Humiliated yet, embarrassed, certainly, but not dead,

[02:10:25.120 --> 02:10:25.900]
not just yet.

[02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:29.060]
For now this is Dan Ruther signing off.

[02:10:29.380 --> 02:10:31.040]
I have a meeting with the people at Sialis

[02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:33.340]
to become the new face of a reptile dysfunction.

[02:10:33.900 --> 02:10:35.540]
This reporter is in as much shock

[02:10:35.540 --> 02:10:37.600]
as Willyn Olson reading his text bill.

[02:10:37.960 --> 02:10:39.180]
But I say this here and now,

[02:10:39.580 --> 02:10:42.080]
I will not go quietly into that good night.

[02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:44.640]
I will maintain what's left of my dignity,

[02:10:44.640 --> 02:10:47.640]
even if I am forced to endorse adult diapers.

[02:10:48.120 --> 02:10:50.920]
Dan Ruther reporting for, well, no one.

[02:10:51.380 --> 02:10:52.740]
Seminole, wait, well, what's going to happen?

[02:10:52.740 --> 02:10:54.600]
Now that Star Jones Reynolds is off the view,

[02:10:54.740 --> 02:10:55.640]
how can the world go on?

[02:10:55.740 --> 02:10:56.000]
You know what?

[02:10:56.180 --> 02:10:57.760]
The sun will rise again.

[02:10:58.200 --> 02:10:59.920]
Now that we got that Brangelina story

[02:10:59.920 --> 02:11:02.600]
and at the Tomcat and the Star Jones Reynolds

[02:11:02.600 --> 02:11:04.560]
and all these other very important things going on,

[02:11:04.900 --> 02:11:05.600]
how can we survive?

[02:11:06.520 --> 02:11:07.640]
7008 votes on the pool.

[02:11:07.740 --> 02:11:08.800]
That's not too shabby, you know?

[02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:10.540]
Our goal is 800 during the show.

[02:11:10.960 --> 02:11:13.260]
I just picked that number out of my earlobe.

[02:11:13.620 --> 02:11:14.600]
But it was a good number.

[02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:16.240]
And you didn't think we could do it?

[02:11:16.500 --> 02:11:17.140]
No, I didn't.

[02:11:17.140 --> 02:11:17.980]
And we still might not.

[02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:19.900]
You know, I mean, we got 57 minutes to go.

[02:11:20.080 --> 02:11:22.280]
You'd think we would be able to on this high-priced show,

[02:11:22.360 --> 02:11:23.980]
but it's still stuck there, sitting at 708.

[02:11:24.500 --> 02:11:26.120]
And we got so many names on there now.

[02:11:26.380 --> 02:11:27.440]
Maybe they're having a difficult time

[02:11:27.440 --> 02:11:28.940]
figuring out who they are like the most.

[02:11:29.260 --> 02:11:30.620]
But the real exciting news is,

[02:11:30.680 --> 02:11:31.880]
and I thought you told me that this,

[02:11:32.720 --> 02:11:34.880]
my space thing was going through the roof.

[02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:36.140]
I don't know what you mean by that.

[02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:39.360]
You got all these friends and we have 111 friends.

[02:11:39.460 --> 02:11:40.100]
Well, what is that?

[02:11:40.820 --> 02:11:42.100]
What is 211?

[02:11:42.100 --> 02:11:44.660]
That's like whatever, that's our friends.

[02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:45.340]
That's a lot.

[02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:46.920]
And it's only been on there for a week.

[02:11:47.260 --> 02:11:49.420]
I mean, the object isn't to see how many friends you can call it.

[02:11:49.420 --> 02:11:49.980]
Yeah, something bad.

[02:11:50.040 --> 02:11:53.220]
That's a lot like the money we raised for a band

[02:11:53.220 --> 02:11:54.540]
and per rescuer this year was a lot.

[02:11:54.860 --> 02:11:57.200]
But those are the people that are using my space.

[02:11:57.520 --> 02:11:57.660]
Yeah.

[02:11:58.320 --> 02:11:59.520]
You know, that are where you put it.

[02:11:59.520 --> 02:12:00.600]
Based on the code you took yesterday,

[02:12:00.800 --> 02:12:02.620]
there aren't that many of our people are using my space.

[02:12:02.740 --> 02:12:04.960]
No, no, it's for young hip people, not old folks.

[02:12:05.160 --> 02:12:06.300]
Not our old group.

[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:07.720]
Like, who falls like we got?

[02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:08.220]
Right.

[02:12:08.860 --> 02:12:09.020]
Right.

[02:12:09.680 --> 02:12:10.480]
Younger and hip are people.

[02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:12.060]
We're like the ones that listen to Daniel Abanister,

[02:12:12.160 --> 02:12:14.240]
both of them with his 1.2 share.

[02:12:14.600 --> 02:12:16.520]
Well, I'm going to tell you, you folks across the street,

[02:12:16.660 --> 02:12:18.340]
Joe Feinberg and all you fakers over there,

[02:12:18.580 --> 02:12:21.100]
we may be like on our last legs this way to your station.

[02:12:21.340 --> 02:12:22.380]
We may be dying over here.

[02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:24.960]
But you people are like, you need to be born again,

[02:12:25.080 --> 02:12:26.500]
because I don't think you got born the first time.

[02:12:27.860 --> 02:12:30.160]
Man, how many times did I tell you in the last couple of years?

[02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:33.600]
You cannot talk yourself into having listeners.

[02:12:33.820 --> 02:12:35.480]
You can't talk yourself into being as successful.

[02:12:35.720 --> 02:12:38.780]
You can make a lot of stories up and you can blow a lot of smoke.

[02:12:38.780 --> 02:12:40.920]
And you can use a lot of your cronies in the media

[02:12:40.920 --> 02:12:45.280]
to blow this smoke for you and create like a cloud.

[02:12:45.780 --> 02:12:48.720]
But when the dust clears and when the actual number is there,

[02:12:48.980 --> 02:12:49.620]
you ain't got it.

[02:12:50.160 --> 02:12:51.140]
You ain't got squat.

[02:12:52.120 --> 02:12:54.860]
And that's why it's so pathetic to kind of swill like it's written

[02:12:54.860 --> 02:12:57.100]
in these two rags called newspapers and soundphones.

[02:12:57.380 --> 02:13:01.640]
It's pathetic, tragic, losers like that old turd,

[02:13:01.820 --> 02:13:05.140]
Jim Sarni and that little piece of pudge, Barry Jackass,

[02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:06.440]
the couch potato.

[02:13:07.080 --> 02:13:08.640]
Oh, I'm Barry Jackson, Neil.

[02:13:08.660 --> 02:13:10.200]
And a lot of what you say about me is true.

[02:13:10.300 --> 02:13:11.180]
Yeah, you're a turd.

[02:13:11.220 --> 02:13:13.840]
OK, you're a fat little turd with a brain

[02:13:13.840 --> 02:13:16.740]
the size of a BB that goes to work at the Harold

[02:13:16.740 --> 02:13:18.800]
with mommy driving every day who makes you a baloney

[02:13:18.800 --> 02:13:19.880]
and peanut butter sandwich.

[02:13:20.340 --> 02:13:22.780]
God, is there any wonder why his brain is turned

[02:13:22.780 --> 02:13:23.540]
or whatever it is?

[02:13:23.900 --> 02:13:24.080]
Crap.

[02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:25.320]
Can we still say that?

[02:13:25.740 --> 02:13:25.880]
Nope.

[02:13:26.360 --> 02:13:28.220]
Call up Joyce and see if we can still say that.

[02:13:28.520 --> 02:13:28.920]
Oh, no.

[02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:30.900]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:32.860]
Come on, let's get some of the intellectual calls on here.

[02:13:32.900 --> 02:13:34.260]
They get a warm up for George tomorrow.

[02:13:34.460 --> 02:13:35.700]
Now, what were your calls like yesterday?

[02:13:36.220 --> 02:13:37.320]
Oh, they were spectacular.

[02:13:37.700 --> 02:13:40.040]
They were intellectual, funny, lovely.

[02:13:40.280 --> 02:13:41.000]
There were a lot of them.

[02:13:41.120 --> 02:13:42.560]
Ladies all over the place, young,

[02:13:42.760 --> 02:13:43.760]
right, even breathing.

[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:45.680]
Living and breathing, the hipsters were calling

[02:13:45.680 --> 02:13:47.120]
any asses all day long.

[02:13:47.280 --> 02:13:47.600]
Yeah, good.

[02:13:47.980 --> 02:13:49.340]
Well, I'm glad because that's your category.

[02:13:49.340 --> 02:13:50.480]
Not that I'm going to need you 100.

[02:13:51.020 --> 02:13:52.500]
No, you got to take care of the younger hip

[02:13:52.500 --> 02:13:53.420]
or a part of the audience.

[02:13:53.560 --> 02:13:55.480]
What I meant to say is they were crap.

[02:13:56.300 --> 02:13:57.200]
Hey, Neil, what's going on?

[02:13:57.440 --> 02:13:57.840]
Yes, sir.

[02:13:58.240 --> 02:13:59.160]
What about Aaron Gil?

[02:14:00.620 --> 02:14:01.160]
Aaron Gil?

[02:14:01.380 --> 02:14:05.040]
Aaron Gil or any two Mingus or Dina Castell and Marietta,

[02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:05.800]
what do you think about those guys?

[02:14:06.380 --> 02:14:08.020]
What are you talking about?

[02:14:08.220 --> 02:14:10.540]
Marietta and Nina and Nani and Aaron Gil

[02:14:10.540 --> 02:14:11.720]
were downkill at the SG.

[02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:15.880]
I thought Kelly was dead.

[02:14:16.600 --> 02:14:17.640]
Oh my God.

[02:14:18.180 --> 02:14:19.340]
What language was he speaking?

[02:14:20.100 --> 02:14:21.340]
Speaking English, baby.

[02:14:21.460 --> 02:14:22.040]
Spigging English.

[02:14:22.260 --> 02:14:23.780]
People are laughing at you, silly ass.

[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:24.080]
OK.

[02:14:24.660 --> 02:14:24.660]

[02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:25.900]
Was that what it was?

[02:14:25.980 --> 02:14:26.560]
Portuguese-y?

[02:14:27.180 --> 02:14:28.560]
I'm thinking of going to Lisboa.

[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:29.680]
Tell me all about it.

[02:14:29.800 --> 02:14:30.300]
It's really big deal.

[02:14:30.420 --> 02:14:33.200]
When I saw that Lisbon, that Portugal soccer team

[02:14:33.200 --> 02:14:36.060]
on there, I saw that Ronaldo guy that plays them.

[02:14:36.100 --> 02:14:36.600]
And they got injured.

[02:14:36.700 --> 02:14:38.540]
Oh gee, he heard his little pinky or whatever.

[02:14:38.800 --> 02:14:40.340]
And he was squeezing it.

[02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:41.100]
He heard it.

[02:14:41.820 --> 02:14:42.760]
Somebody QYM, hello?

[02:14:43.200 --> 02:14:44.000]
And Neil, how are you?

[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:44.660]
OK.

[02:14:45.080 --> 02:14:47.100]
And Neil, can you please tell me, because I

[02:14:47.100 --> 02:14:47.540]
missed it.

[02:14:47.620 --> 02:14:50.740]
I've been a listener ever since probably 86.

[02:14:51.700 --> 02:14:53.940]
What happened with the kind of leaves of thing

[02:14:53.940 --> 02:14:55.160]
that you couldn't play it anymore?

[02:14:55.700 --> 02:14:57.500]
I know they can down on you or something.

[02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.880]
But I never got it from where for what happened.

[02:15:01.460 --> 02:15:02.360]
We can't play it anymore.

[02:15:02.360 --> 02:15:02.560]
I know.

[02:15:02.800 --> 02:15:04.080]
Yeah, but tell me why.

[02:15:04.600 --> 02:15:05.280]
Tell you why?

[02:15:05.580 --> 02:15:06.360]
Because we can't.

[02:15:06.600 --> 02:15:07.120]
Because why?

[02:15:07.260 --> 02:15:07.680]
That's why.

[02:15:07.960 --> 02:15:08.760]
I think it is good.

[02:15:09.260 --> 02:15:09.620]
OK.

[02:15:10.320 --> 02:15:10.980]
It's not good.

[02:15:11.060 --> 02:15:12.140]
It's bad is what it is.

[02:15:12.240 --> 02:15:12.580]
Real bad.

[02:15:14.120 --> 02:15:15.420]
5670560, 0.566.

[02:15:15.420 --> 02:15:16.580]
That was a griepar doing a voice.

[02:15:16.960 --> 02:15:18.500]
Now, he couldn't do that kind of a voice.

[02:15:19.260 --> 02:15:21.200]
You know, the fact that I'm not going to go into it.

[02:15:21.340 --> 02:15:23.620]
Just going to bite my tongue until it

[02:15:23.620 --> 02:15:25.460]
bleeds real hard, you know, all over the place.

[02:15:25.560 --> 02:15:26.220]
So it tastes it.

[02:15:26.480 --> 02:15:28.620]
It's just amazing, you know?

[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:31.420]
Clarence and his boyfriend is now running the radio

[02:15:31.420 --> 02:15:32.780]
station and take a look at those numbers.

[02:15:32.940 --> 02:15:34.760]
Man, take a look at those trends and weep.

[02:15:34.900 --> 02:15:36.080]
Why did he weep?

[02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:37.900]
My God, it was great.

[02:15:38.100 --> 02:15:39.260]
Asking radio station.

[02:15:39.560 --> 02:15:41.060]
And it's not because they went across the street.

[02:15:41.860 --> 02:15:44.920]
I mean, even if you put if you take the sports segments and you put the numbers of

[02:15:44.920 --> 02:15:47.740]
the two stations together, you still got an embarrassing number.

[02:15:48.200 --> 02:15:48.600]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:15:49.520 --> 02:15:51.740]
And nobody wants to be doing an embarrassing number.

[02:15:52.600 --> 02:15:53.180]
W.A.C.Y.M.

[02:15:53.300 --> 02:15:53.420]
Hello.

[02:15:53.800 --> 02:15:55.020]
You go and in Canada.

[02:15:55.440 --> 02:15:56.140]
W.A.C.Y.M.

[02:15:56.240 --> 02:15:56.360]
Hello.

[02:15:56.980 --> 02:15:57.700]
It's Clarence.

[02:15:58.040 --> 02:15:58.080]
Yes.

[02:15:58.840 --> 02:15:59.580]
W.A.C.Y.M.

[02:15:59.700 --> 02:15:59.820]
Hello.

[02:16:00.340 --> 02:16:02.200]
You were talking about the Greek one.

[02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:03.180]
W.A.C.Y.M.

[02:16:03.320 --> 02:16:03.440]
Hello.

[02:16:03.740 --> 02:16:04.100]
Yes.

[02:16:04.460 --> 02:16:06.240]
Did you mention John Ritter yet?

[02:16:06.800 --> 02:16:07.600]
Yeah, we mentioned him.

[02:16:07.780 --> 02:16:08.520]
Do you want to hold for him?

[02:16:08.600 --> 02:16:09.040]
I hope not.

[02:16:09.940 --> 02:16:10.360]
Okay.

[02:16:10.580 --> 02:16:11.020]
Thank you.

[02:16:11.200 --> 02:16:12.380]
What did you like about John Ritter?

[02:16:13.160 --> 02:16:17.940]
I just get from the old days I watched three from off the neighborhood.

[02:16:18.380 --> 02:16:19.140]
Oh my God.

[02:16:19.220 --> 02:16:20.860]
Well, I'm sure glad you got that out of your system, man.

[02:16:21.300 --> 02:16:21.920]
All right.

[02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:24.060]
So all I can say to you is you're fairy.

[02:16:24.360 --> 02:16:25.500]
It wasn't the marathon the other day.

[02:16:26.080 --> 02:16:29.400]
Did we actually I mean we when we went through the list of people of God.

[02:16:33.420 --> 02:16:34.340]
We mentioned him.

[02:16:34.400 --> 02:16:34.980]
But we put him on.

[02:16:35.460 --> 02:16:37.820]
Yeah, no, not there like come time.

[02:16:39.140 --> 02:16:39.940]
You got a boat.

[02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:45.220]
He's got two boats.

[02:16:45.800 --> 02:16:46.580]
He's got a pair.

[02:16:46.740 --> 02:16:47.440]
John Ritter had a pair.

[02:16:47.700 --> 02:16:49.240]
I never would have believed that.

[02:16:49.380 --> 02:16:50.640]
I understand who's a very nice guy.

[02:16:51.520 --> 02:16:52.240]
Who cares?

[02:16:52.660 --> 02:16:53.540]
All the people around him.

[02:16:53.620 --> 02:16:53.860]
I'm sure.

[02:16:53.860 --> 02:16:54.820]
Oh, okay.

[02:16:55.940 --> 02:16:56.440]
That's enough.

[02:16:56.720 --> 02:16:59.280]
We don't need anything more than it was a bad theme and a bad show.

[02:16:59.520 --> 02:17:04.200]
And he was about as funny as that, but the chicks there were organic tumor on your kneecap, man.

[02:17:04.280 --> 02:17:07.680]
He wasn't funny at all or entertaining or a good actor or anything else.

[02:17:07.700 --> 02:17:08.300]
He had no talent.

[02:17:08.700 --> 02:17:09.680]
Now, what's the need to sound of film?

[02:17:09.680 --> 02:17:10.020]
I read it.

[02:17:10.160 --> 02:17:11.160]
I just make that up.

[02:17:11.800 --> 02:17:12.740]
Oh, come on.

[02:17:12.840 --> 02:17:13.240]
I read a film.

[02:17:13.380 --> 02:17:16.000]
The character actress from a hundred years ago.

[02:17:16.280 --> 02:17:17.120]
You better film.

[02:17:17.140 --> 02:17:17.960]
A writer was great.

[02:17:18.400 --> 02:17:19.280]
Google it as what?

[02:17:19.820 --> 02:17:20.540]
As herself.

[02:17:21.120 --> 02:17:21.760]
As something.

[02:17:22.360 --> 02:17:22.800]
Google it.

[02:17:22.800 --> 02:17:23.960]
Filma Ritter.

[02:17:24.520 --> 02:17:26.680]
And you'll say, oh my goodness, I know who that is.

[02:17:27.260 --> 02:17:28.000]
Hello, any QYM?

[02:17:28.140 --> 02:17:28.280]
Hello.

[02:17:28.620 --> 02:17:29.600]
All right, Neil.

[02:17:30.060 --> 02:17:30.720]
Yes, ma'am.

[02:17:31.060 --> 02:17:33.120]
Did you all mention Grace Kelly yet?

[02:17:34.040 --> 02:17:35.540]
How could we forget Princess Grace?

[02:17:36.880 --> 02:17:39.440]
Every time we do, every time we do one of these, we put around her.

[02:17:39.460 --> 02:17:40.400]
She never gets any votes.

[02:17:40.720 --> 02:17:42.240]
Oh, that's not right.

[02:17:42.540 --> 02:17:43.240]
That is not right.

[02:17:43.320 --> 02:17:43.620]
You're right.

[02:17:43.880 --> 02:17:44.540]
How about that?

[02:17:44.720 --> 02:17:46.080]
And can I ask George a question?

[02:17:46.400 --> 02:17:46.860]
Go right ahead.

[02:17:47.180 --> 02:17:49.380]
Hey, George, what's the F4C for?

[02:17:49.960 --> 02:17:50.640]
The what now?

[02:17:51.380 --> 02:17:55.120]
F4C, you were saying that yesterday you were talking about it

[02:17:55.120 --> 02:18:00.040]
and you had conversations with your wife about the F4C and what it does?

[02:18:00.500 --> 02:18:01.320]
About the ALT-F.

[02:18:01.580 --> 02:18:03.120]
Oh, ALT-F, I'm sorry.

[02:18:03.260 --> 02:18:03.900]
No problem.

[02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:05.620]
I'll write you a letter.

[02:18:08.540 --> 02:18:09.360]
All right.

[02:18:09.740 --> 02:18:10.840]
Boy, sure, Pete, my curiosity.

[02:18:11.740 --> 02:18:12.720]
ALT-F, my ass.

[02:18:13.780 --> 02:18:14.660]
That's the keyboard.

[02:18:14.800 --> 02:18:15.600]
What the hell is that?

[02:18:16.260 --> 02:18:17.460]
The ALT-F key.

[02:18:17.620 --> 02:18:18.740]
It was something I mentioned in passing.

[02:18:18.920 --> 02:18:19.200]
She heard it.

[02:18:19.920 --> 02:18:22.440]
Well, she was very perspicacious and nice lady.

[02:18:22.480 --> 02:18:23.080]
We learned justice.

[02:18:23.400 --> 02:18:23.680]
Yes.

[02:18:23.740 --> 02:18:25.340]
So we got Grace Kelly on air or what?

[02:18:25.680 --> 02:18:25.840]
Yes.

[02:18:25.860 --> 02:18:26.480]
Princess Grace.

[02:18:27.140 --> 02:18:27.960]
Oh, that's Delmariner.

[02:18:27.960 --> 02:18:28.860]
You mentioned her before.

[02:18:29.300 --> 02:18:30.720]
And you know something?

[02:18:31.260 --> 02:18:33.500]
This couldn't happen again in a billion years.

[02:18:33.500 --> 02:18:34.220]
You want to know why?

[02:18:34.320 --> 02:18:34.440]
Why?

[02:18:34.920 --> 02:18:36.400]
Who did she just say for the poll?

[02:18:37.060 --> 02:18:37.400]
Grace Kelly.

[02:18:37.860 --> 02:18:38.020]
Right.

[02:18:38.520 --> 02:18:40.060]
Who was in rear window who played the maid?

[02:18:40.640 --> 02:18:41.060]
Delmariner.

[02:18:41.460 --> 02:18:42.700]
That's why you mentioned it before.

[02:18:43.800 --> 02:18:44.640]
Holy crap.

[02:18:46.400 --> 02:18:47.540]
What are I talking about?

[02:18:47.540 --> 02:18:49.740]
All these years, I've been telling you people

[02:18:49.740 --> 02:18:52.200]
that there are no coincidences that everything in life at all

[02:18:52.200 --> 02:18:53.780]
it all pieces together.

[02:18:53.940 --> 02:18:55.420]
You know, it's like a juice saw puzzle.

[02:18:55.660 --> 02:18:57.000]
I mean, like a...

[02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:57.580]
...saw puzzle.

[02:18:57.880 --> 02:18:59.220]
Can't say that for a syllable no more.

[02:18:59.500 --> 02:18:59.880]
Not anymore.

[02:19:00.440 --> 02:19:01.260]
You see what I'm saying though?

[02:19:01.700 --> 02:19:03.500]
That that couldn't happen again in a billion years.

[02:19:04.100 --> 02:19:05.240]
In a trillion years.

[02:19:05.480 --> 02:19:06.560]
In the history of the human race.

[02:19:06.800 --> 02:19:08.480]
That should be on the front page of every major newspaper.

[02:19:09.080 --> 02:19:09.880]
Forget about wire tabs.

[02:19:10.160 --> 02:19:11.700]
Forget about the bank transactions.

[02:19:12.640 --> 02:19:15.140]
The Neil Rogers show falls into a bucket of crap.

[02:19:16.840 --> 02:19:19.300]
And what will we do just this watch here a couple of weeks ago?

[02:19:19.660 --> 02:19:20.580]
For a rear window.

[02:19:21.200 --> 02:19:22.340]
Delmariner was the maid, right?

[02:19:22.540 --> 02:19:22.800]
That's right.

[02:19:22.920 --> 02:19:24.740]
I want to know who the ballet dancer was.

[02:19:25.040 --> 02:19:25.760]
That was good.

[02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:29.580]
I think it was Raymond Burr.

[02:19:31.700 --> 02:19:33.220]
In his lighter days.

[02:19:33.660 --> 02:19:35.580]
12 minutes after one at 560 W.F.

[02:19:35.620 --> 02:19:36.140]
I still...

[02:19:36.140 --> 02:19:37.880]
I think that would have felt better after doing that.

[02:19:38.060 --> 02:19:41.540]
For years now, I've been telling you about the Melting Pot famous fondue restaurants.

[02:19:42.020 --> 02:19:43.900]
And boy, if you haven't been in the pot for a while now,

[02:19:43.900 --> 02:19:44.880]
it's the time to go back.

[02:19:45.140 --> 02:19:46.680]
Especially during these boring summer days.

[02:19:47.180 --> 02:19:49.940]
You know, if you can't enjoy a bean outdoors when it's 100 degrees in the shade

[02:19:49.940 --> 02:19:51.660]
and the mosquitoes are as big as boring balls,

[02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:53.280]
at least go get yourself a great meal.

[02:19:53.680 --> 02:19:54.780]
In fact, it's more than just a meal.

[02:19:54.900 --> 02:19:56.160]
It's an entire dining experience.

[02:19:56.580 --> 02:19:59.840]
Take the whole gang for a full four-course dining experience,

[02:19:59.980 --> 02:20:01.520]
starting with a renowned cheese fondue.

[02:20:01.780 --> 02:20:03.720]
They serve it up with three different kinds of great bread,

[02:20:03.940 --> 02:20:05.460]
granny Smith apples and crisp veggies.

[02:20:06.060 --> 02:20:07.760]
Next comes your choice of lively salads.

[02:20:08.160 --> 02:20:10.600]
And then your entrees include the combination of lobster filet mignon.

[02:20:11.280 --> 02:20:12.580]
What is it after the filet mignon?

[02:20:12.580 --> 02:20:13.400]
I give up.

[02:20:13.520 --> 02:20:13.880]
Oh, oh.

[02:20:14.280 --> 02:20:16.160]
See, you know, Cajun seasoned chicken.

[02:20:16.500 --> 02:20:18.800]
That's my bag, because I never let you do that in this fondue before.

[02:20:18.900 --> 02:20:19.660]
And that's my bag.

[02:20:19.980 --> 02:20:22.480]
Pork duck, portabello mushrooms, and lots more cooked in oil or broth.

[02:20:22.940 --> 02:20:25.720]
And the reason I didn't let them do that is because we have to pay them for each one he throws in there.

[02:20:26.020 --> 02:20:27.840]
And don't forget the Melting Pot's homemade dipping sauces.

[02:20:28.200 --> 02:20:30.680]
They really make the fondue experience fun and delish.

[02:20:30.720 --> 02:20:33.800]
And now the clincher is those amazing desserts.

[02:20:34.380 --> 02:20:37.800]
The famous chocolate fondue desserts that we've been almost tongue-tied

[02:20:37.800 --> 02:20:40.880]
with fresh strawberries, bananas, pineapples, cheesecake, brownies,

[02:20:40.880 --> 02:20:43.780]
and tasty marshmallows rolled in crust Oreos or graham crackers

[02:20:43.780 --> 02:20:46.140]
for dipping only at the Melting Pot.

[02:20:46.400 --> 02:20:47.820]
You've got pots all over time, man.

[02:20:47.900 --> 02:20:50.020]
Tell me that old Neil sent you by for a real dining experience

[02:20:50.020 --> 02:20:53.020]
and enjoy life crazy, the Fort Lauderdale location kindle.

[02:20:53.260 --> 02:20:57.360]
Milk of a tone, crawl springs, Cooper City, and of course, prestigious North Miami beach.

[02:20:57.760 --> 02:20:59.860]
This is New Rogers.

[02:21:00.880 --> 02:21:03.900]
This is the vice-16 key place.

[02:21:05.660 --> 02:21:06.540]
Man, that way.

[02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:08.160]
How are you talking to that way?

[02:21:10.580 --> 02:21:12.740]
I've worked here. I didn't come here to be mistreated.

[02:21:13.520 --> 02:21:15.500]
That's what I came in a work today.

[02:21:15.660 --> 02:21:16.360]
That's why I come in.

[02:21:16.800 --> 02:21:18.140]
That's why I came in here.

[02:21:18.220 --> 02:21:20.880]
I don't want to go to lunch, George.

[02:21:21.340 --> 02:21:23.300]
We just need to get off talk that way to a working man.

[02:21:25.460 --> 02:21:26.820]
That's what I came in here for.

[02:21:26.960 --> 02:21:28.000]
That's what I'm trying to do.

[02:21:28.420 --> 02:21:29.700]
I mean, I mean to stop with that.

[02:21:30.280 --> 02:21:33.280]
I mean to stop with that.

[02:21:33.480 --> 02:21:34.160]
That's not right.

[02:21:34.860 --> 02:21:36.780]
That's not as long as I...

[02:21:36.780 --> 02:21:37.760]
You get out of here?

[02:21:37.980 --> 02:21:39.520]
Will you get out of here?

[02:21:40.060 --> 02:21:42.040]
I'm trying to run an office here.

[02:21:42.320 --> 02:21:43.180]
Now, will you go to lunch?

[02:21:43.520 --> 02:21:44.020]
Go to lunch.

[02:21:44.500 --> 02:21:45.780]
Will you go to lunch?

[02:21:46.980 --> 02:21:49.400]
Jesus Christ, the Christian talk,

[02:21:49.800 --> 02:21:51.760]
where you're holding for the helping man.

[02:21:52.740 --> 02:21:54.180]
Who is the Jesus Christ?

[02:21:54.700 --> 02:21:58.020]
The Christian talk, the way we do the ancient prayer.

[02:21:59.160 --> 02:22:01.940]
Who runs back, runs the holy book of the God?

[02:22:02.360 --> 02:22:04.140]
Who is the Holy Book of the Holy Spirit?

[02:22:04.140 --> 02:22:05.240]
That never goes down.

[02:22:05.500 --> 02:22:08.340]
Who is riding on the cannon and turning the handle down?

[02:22:08.900 --> 02:22:11.120]
Who is the Jesus Christ who is the crown of the rift of your brother?

[02:22:11.760 --> 02:22:12.020]
Who?

[02:22:12.160 --> 02:22:14.500]
Man, man, man, Jesus Christ is doing.

[02:22:14.860 --> 02:22:15.060]
Who?

[02:22:15.340 --> 02:22:17.600]
Man, man, man, the portion of the Savior is doing.

[02:22:18.020 --> 02:22:18.220]
Who?

[02:22:18.420 --> 02:22:20.760]
Who can make the Jews a doctor for fun to eat?

[02:22:21.200 --> 02:22:24.000]
While they run the Bible, I can recognize your grace.

[02:22:24.760 --> 02:22:26.740]
All the followers of the Holy Spirit

[02:22:26.740 --> 02:22:29.180]
help us enter all the wishes of God.

[02:22:29.560 --> 02:22:33.580]
And I'll let you sign the way we are snakes on the getting.

[02:22:33.580 --> 02:22:35.600]
And come to take us away.

[02:22:36.780 --> 02:22:39.520]
Our hearts are in the gosh of the earth.

[02:22:39.960 --> 02:22:42.580]
Who will walk with the great Ayamacule?

[02:22:43.180 --> 02:22:46.000]
Who needs the great people to want to get their gifts?

[02:22:46.640 --> 02:22:49.000]
We put the blood and blood of the disciples.

[02:22:49.380 --> 02:22:51.980]
How great to the Lord, give forgiveness.

[02:22:52.540 --> 02:22:55.620]
Listen, joy, self-closely appointed to you.

[02:22:55.700 --> 02:22:57.800]
Who is the Jesus Christ?

[02:22:58.560 --> 02:23:00.500]
The Lord never wins.

[02:23:01.920 --> 02:23:03.320]
Who needs this man?

[02:23:03.560 --> 02:23:09.460]
Who needs the Jesus Christ?

[02:23:10.120 --> 02:23:13.340]
Who needs the Christ foraces in Christ's car?

[02:23:14.240 --> 02:23:15.760]
Our喝b the grass, coming on to pull,

[02:23:15.900 --> 02:23:18.620]
Good news is this she's on again, glad it was and if you didn't have any it was you.

[02:23:21.740 --> 02:23:24.080]
How many times of history of your life?

[02:23:24.380 --> 02:23:27.080]
Elder curlycy, twice

[02:23:27.080 --> 02:23:31.720]
before twice, you know, a hundred years. And now a lot of a sudden the lady calls in

[02:23:31.720 --> 02:23:35.740]
with Grace Kelly and Josh has just seen thanks to my generosity, we were windowed a couple

[02:23:35.740 --> 02:23:40.000]
weeks ago and it put all the pieces together and what do you got? Let me steer it in a wheelchair

[02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:46.360]
with the nocklers. Pretty boring. Except for the end. It was not boring. Every scene in

[02:23:46.360 --> 02:23:57.060]
one room, maid comes in and his buddy comes in, the FBI guy, but the end was good. It

[02:23:57.860 --> 02:24:06.740]
was a good idea. You know, this could be a regular feature on a show. Josh Court has movie

[02:24:06.740 --> 02:24:12.580]
reviews. Only for the ones he didn't fall asleep in the middle of though. Well, he didn't.

[02:24:12.680 --> 02:24:16.200]
He made it to the end of the. You're doing okay so far. You got some good ones for me.

[02:24:16.220 --> 02:24:19.680]
Yeah. You got two that I did not lament. Network he didn't like you fell asleep in the

[02:24:19.680 --> 02:24:24.660]
middle of it. It was too ponderous for him. I can't give a positive review on rear window

[02:24:24.660 --> 02:24:29.840]
is ponderous and boring, but the ending was good. Okay, but I like Glen Gary Glen Ross.

[02:24:30.100 --> 02:24:35.020]
You turned me on directly and for a dream. Yeah. I remember once and for that.

[02:24:35.460 --> 02:24:40.240]
Clothes as long as. Right. There you go. Crash was excellent. What else did you know

[02:24:40.240 --> 02:24:45.000]
that I see from you? Did we send him happiness or standing in the shadow of a Motown?

[02:24:45.400 --> 02:24:51.460]
Right. I think that's it from you. Happiness? Nope. Very sick. Now what do you think, George?

[02:24:51.460 --> 02:24:54.700]
You think he's ready to watch that? I don't know. I wouldn't have liked that on him.

[02:24:55.320 --> 02:25:07.060]
What do you mean by that? It's got a lot of spodia in it. Oh, I think I need a vacation.

[02:25:08.340 --> 02:25:11.840]
Here's a fact from Bill and for a lot of the other day who says my vote is for an abused

[02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:16.260]
talent typical in the recording industry. Stevie Ray Vaughn rock on says Bill. Well, I got

[02:25:16.260 --> 02:25:21.060]
news for him. My initial inclination was nobody's going to vote for Stevie Ray, but if

[02:25:21.060 --> 02:25:27.140]
Jerry Garcia can be on here and Jeff Garcia, why not? Right. Right. Stevie Ray Vaughn,

[02:25:27.220 --> 02:25:33.280]
who by the way, still dead. Wow. Yeah. Okay. Well, to make you watch happiness. It's

[02:25:33.280 --> 02:25:37.960]
very sick. You don't think it's a good movie? I thought it was very good. Yeah. I thought

[02:25:37.960 --> 02:25:42.300]
it was excellent. It's just very, very sick. There are some unsettling moments in it. No,

[02:25:42.480 --> 02:25:48.120]
no kidding. Yeah. No kidding. Well, it's easy to do that or Jerry, take your pick. No,

[02:25:48.120 --> 02:25:52.500]
I'm good. I still need to see the imaginary heroes, you said. Right. Oh, no, I'm not

[02:25:52.500 --> 02:25:55.240]
going to let's see. We debated that while you were on vacation, George. You think he

[02:25:55.240 --> 02:25:59.900]
wouldn't enjoy that movie? I don't know. Have you had it? Did I send you a copy of it?

[02:26:00.220 --> 02:26:03.600]
Yeah, I have it. I think I'll bring it in. Fine. Let him see it. He can review a one

[02:26:03.600 --> 02:26:09.940]
day on the air just like his son letting review a rear window. If I can draw a theme

[02:26:09.940 --> 02:26:14.960]
or have a theory about Josh's taste, pacing in a movie has a lot to do with whether or

[02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:20.920]
he likes it. I wouldn't say that that movie drags. No, not exactly. It's not exactly

[02:26:20.920 --> 02:26:26.340]
fast-paced. It's not like an action-filled dynamic. Oh, I like that. Josh Kortiscale, maybe

[02:26:26.340 --> 02:26:30.220]
it's a little too slow for him. That's why I like to give it a shot. Let's give it a shot.

[02:26:30.500 --> 02:26:34.300]
I'm sure he can get by. Just skip the scene on New Year's Eve. Okay, that's my warning

[02:26:34.300 --> 02:26:37.460]
to you. It's very short. There's nothing really there at all that unsettling, but just

[02:26:37.460 --> 02:26:41.500]
pretend that it didn't happen. Yeah. I'm trying to. Yeah, and then so we're both of them.

[02:26:41.500 --> 02:26:47.460]
It must have been the X-C747 votes on a poll. 747. We got 30. I think we got a chance

[02:26:47.460 --> 02:26:51.460]
for that 800. It's going to be nip and tuck, man. Oh, man. It's going to be nose to nose.

[02:26:51.800 --> 02:26:55.540]
Is it going to be good or what? No, we didn't get any comment about that movie. You're

[02:26:55.540 --> 02:27:01.160]
hopefully nobody in this audience has suffered having to see that. Maybe the little lines

[02:27:01.160 --> 02:27:05.420]
are lit up for maybe they're just happy to be on my cable last night. And it was I don't

[02:27:05.420 --> 02:27:09.640]
know, Matt Damon, who I usually is movies are pretty good. And I had no idea. I never

[02:27:09.640 --> 02:27:13.620]
seen what's his name before Casey Affleck. I know who he is. Yeah, I don't want to see

[02:27:13.620 --> 02:27:19.020]
him again. Huh? I don't think I've seen him in anything. Good. WQA and hello. Hello.

[02:27:19.980 --> 02:27:24.500]
Hello. Hey, how you doing? Neil. Okay. Have you ever heard of the movie called the

[02:27:24.500 --> 02:27:30.440]
United States of Leland? No. It's not about Leland, the former Marlins manager. I have no

[02:27:30.440 --> 02:27:34.120]
idea. Yeah, right? This is grandson. No, but you know what? It's along the lines of

[02:27:34.120 --> 02:27:40.320]
a imaginary whatever the hell it is. Heroes. Yeah. Which I saw. It's it's along that line.

[02:27:40.540 --> 02:27:43.940]
It's a little weird. Now, what did you think of a manager here? Was it not a pretty interesting

[02:27:43.940 --> 02:27:48.020]
story? It was it was pretty cool. It really was. Yeah, it was, you know, there was some

[02:27:48.020 --> 02:27:51.980]
scenes or just out there you're leaving it on. What the hell's going on? And Sigourney Weaver,

[02:27:51.980 --> 02:27:55.500]
man. She was just fabulous. You know, once you once you once you found the good stuff.

[02:27:57.080 --> 02:28:01.200]
Yeah, that's just getting trouble. But check. Check this. It's a weird movie. You know,

[02:28:01.200 --> 02:28:05.620]
you got to sort of stick through it, but it's called the United States of Leland. Okay.

[02:28:06.020 --> 02:28:10.380]
All right. I'll talk to you. Thanks, Maui. No problem. I okay. Well, it's like a

[02:28:10.380 --> 02:28:13.800]
imaginary. Of course, I don't know. How do you say a movie is like another movie? I

[02:28:13.800 --> 02:28:17.400]
don't know. You do. I've seen a trip around the cable, but I didn't actually watch it.

[02:28:17.400 --> 02:28:21.780]
I've just seen it listed the United States of Leland. Yeah. I don't remember why, but the

[02:28:21.780 --> 02:28:25.280]
description didn't sound. Now, I'm going to have to say that Jim Leland said across from

[02:28:25.280 --> 02:28:28.340]
me a pomp and a park at the table one night was very quiet and I'm assuming that that was

[02:28:28.340 --> 02:28:33.080]
back after his Marl Managing days, I believe you can say that. I already said it a million

[02:28:33.080 --> 02:28:36.700]
times just like Kenny Rogers said at the other cross in the other end of the table one night.

[02:28:36.880 --> 02:28:40.280]
Yeah. Did you have any? And I'll tell us to about Pete Roestead over there with some

[02:28:40.280 --> 02:28:43.960]
Flusi with all those $100 bills piled up to the sky and how they were by the end of

[02:28:43.960 --> 02:28:46.700]
the night they were all gone. Next, you're going to tell me you played Slots next to Burton

[02:28:46.700 --> 02:28:51.960]
Cummings. Oh, did you have to remind me? Yeah, you know, I hate to admit this. You know,

[02:28:52.060 --> 02:28:55.700]
all the great music that you send me that I have in my iPod. Yes. And you know how much

[02:28:55.700 --> 02:29:00.220]
I love the guest who yes, I can't listen to it. Oh, no. Just pretend to be a different

[02:29:00.220 --> 02:29:05.560]
person. I'm trying. Kind of was somebody inspired by that. Oh my God. You see one thing

[02:29:05.560 --> 02:29:08.720]
about all you people that want to meet any of us or meet, you know, big celebrities

[02:29:09.120 --> 02:29:14.420]
don't. Yeah. Don't because rarely will it be, you know, up to your expectations. It'll

[02:29:14.420 --> 02:29:20.300]
almost always be disappointing, bitterly disappointing or just a total disaster. One of those

[02:29:20.300 --> 02:29:24.660]
three. Am I right? Oh, and in my case, it's guaranteed. What do you mean by that? They

[02:29:24.660 --> 02:29:28.340]
knew they met you. They'll meet me. They'll always be like, yeah, but let's face it.

[02:29:28.520 --> 02:29:32.140]
When you go on those appearances, look at the other way around from your perspective. Yeah,

[02:29:32.140 --> 02:29:36.100]
I know. There you go. So you've got you got the thumb up on them. It's probably best

[02:29:36.100 --> 02:29:39.760]
for everyone that we don't meet. Right. That's the way I feel about it. Just like my coming

[02:29:39.760 --> 02:29:44.140]
back to the station, man. Is it going to happen? No. No. You know, it was nifty. New people

[02:29:44.140 --> 02:29:48.900]
including, you know, our management people in the sales manager guy, you know, 400 new

[02:29:48.900 --> 02:29:52.620]
sales people. Well, let me forget the next Thursday morning to tell you about that spot.

[02:29:52.620 --> 02:29:57.440]
I was referring to the day. Okay. 27 past one. Jackson, which one it is. He would lighten

[02:29:57.440 --> 02:30:02.000]

[02:31:15.340 --> 02:31:17.580]
It's 5.62 AF.

[02:31:19.940 --> 02:31:23.160]
Suffering from a burning ring of fire.

[02:31:29.880 --> 02:31:33.820]
Don't let those flames get higher. Use preparation aids.

[02:31:44.600 --> 02:31:51.120]
We take you now to New York's Grand Central Station where two of America's worst singers are begging for money.

[02:31:51.420 --> 02:31:54.020]
Ladies and gentlemen, the bad street boys.

[02:31:54.320 --> 02:31:58.720]
In the middle of the night, I go walking in my sleep.

[02:31:59.680 --> 02:32:00.100]
Wow!

[02:32:00.500 --> 02:32:03.020]
Hey, buddy, I'm on a dollar. Give me some dollars.

[02:32:03.160 --> 02:32:03.800]
I might get a gift.

[02:32:03.800 --> 02:32:03.800]

[02:32:03.800 --> 02:32:03.800]

[02:32:03.800 --> 02:32:03.800]

[02:32:03.800 --> 02:32:03.800]

[02:32:03.800 --> 02:32:03.800]

[02:32:04.500 --> 02:32:06.080]
For the appreciation of the music.

[02:32:06.260 --> 02:32:06.880]
We're in an entertain.

[02:32:07.520 --> 02:32:08.860]
That was horrible.

[02:32:09.040 --> 02:32:11.920]
We take requests. We appreciate you. He doesn't like Billy Joel.

[02:32:12.120 --> 02:32:13.020]
That's probably what it is.

[02:32:13.200 --> 02:32:14.700]
How about a little Elton John?

[02:32:14.700 --> 02:32:17.800]
La! La! La! La! La! La!

[02:32:18.200 --> 02:32:22.660]
I'm in the sound of shot and then my feet just go so fast.

[02:32:23.560 --> 02:32:23.780]
Yeah!

[02:32:24.760 --> 02:32:27.140]
I think my ears are bleeding from that one.

[02:32:27.220 --> 02:32:28.060]
What's the matter with you?

[02:32:28.340 --> 02:32:29.520]
You guys are horrible words.

[02:32:29.520 --> 02:32:30.880]
You guys are like Elton John.

[02:32:31.580 --> 02:32:33.020]
How about some for the kids?

[02:32:33.180 --> 02:32:35.440]
How about a little Christina Aguilara and beautiful?

[02:32:36.680 --> 02:32:37.560]
You're beautiful!

[02:32:38.880 --> 02:32:39.380]
Beautiful!

[02:32:41.060 --> 02:32:41.420]
Beautiful!

[02:32:41.420 --> 02:32:41.980]
Beautiful!

[02:32:43.520 --> 02:32:44.500]
Here's $10.

[02:32:45.360 --> 02:32:48.060]
Be quiet. Stop singing. I really gotta go.

[02:32:48.320 --> 02:32:48.620]
Wait a minute.

[02:32:49.080 --> 02:32:51.140]
We've gotta do something a little special.

[02:32:51.180 --> 02:32:52.440]
I'm core! No!

[02:32:53.400 --> 02:32:56.800]
You are the sunshine of my life.

[02:32:57.200 --> 02:32:57.620]
I'm in it.

[02:32:59.340 --> 02:33:01.780]
Keep out you'll not be my food.

[02:33:01.920 --> 02:33:04.240]
Wherever you're around, I'm smiling.

[02:33:06.140 --> 02:33:07.720]
Yeah! Thank you, sir.

[02:33:07.900 --> 02:33:09.500]
That honestly left me speechless.

[02:33:09.500 --> 02:33:12.380]
I knew the bad street boys.

[02:33:12.500 --> 02:33:15.620]
The bad street boys!

[02:33:17.860 --> 02:33:18.740]
134-560.

[02:33:18.840 --> 02:33:21.460]
We got the award winning Evan Colin coming up at 2 o'clock.

[02:33:21.680 --> 02:33:22.880]
You say what award are you talking about?

[02:33:23.040 --> 02:33:24.080]
The Jim Sarni Award.

[02:33:24.540 --> 02:33:26.060]
And then we got the Curtis Stevenson in 4.

[02:33:26.540 --> 02:33:28.420]
Leith Lee, a Feldman and Craig Mischit.

[02:33:28.520 --> 02:33:31.260]
7 o'clock phone by the advocate show from Showgirls.

[02:33:31.640 --> 02:33:31.820]
You show?

[02:33:32.700 --> 02:33:35.140]
Showways can be 760 votes on a poll.

[02:33:35.340 --> 02:33:37.400]
We need 40 in 26 minutes.

[02:33:37.400 --> 02:33:39.120]
Oh, 760-3.

[02:33:39.200 --> 02:33:40.780]
We need 37 in 26 minutes.

[02:33:40.780 --> 02:33:41.860]
It's like 1.5 a minute.

[02:33:42.060 --> 02:33:43.560]
So give at least 1.5 a vote.

[02:33:45.380 --> 02:33:46.780]
How did I hit this poll?

[02:33:46.940 --> 02:33:47.960]
Did I goose it up a little bit?

[02:33:49.020 --> 02:33:50.660]
Let's look. Can you find it?

[02:33:50.780 --> 02:33:51.640]
I can't even find it.

[02:33:52.400 --> 02:33:54.460]
Yeah, it's got a dozen. See, I told you.

[02:33:54.980 --> 02:33:56.380]
None of the above has got 15.

[02:33:56.600 --> 02:33:57.960]
And that's got a dozen. So we make the 800.

[02:33:58.020 --> 02:34:01.080]
We can thanks to my first vacancy of having Josh put those on there.

[02:34:01.700 --> 02:34:02.820]
So originally I said 750.

[02:34:03.060 --> 02:34:04.480]
I probably should have left that alone, shouldn't I?

[02:34:04.480 --> 02:34:06.540]
I always thought I'd better set the bar too high.

[02:34:06.720 --> 02:34:10.100]
It's like being on a sports show and so forth expecting more than a one share.

[02:34:10.500 --> 02:34:11.780]
Maybe a little teeny bit more.

[02:34:11.980 --> 02:34:14.740]
Like Daniel Bastard did with that 1.2 in afternoon drive.

[02:34:14.840 --> 02:34:15.660]
Oh my God.

[02:34:15.660 --> 02:34:17.660]
Oh my goodness. 1.2 in men.

[02:34:18.240 --> 02:34:19.960]
1.2 share in men.

[02:34:20.440 --> 02:34:22.580]
What kind of a pansy has an upper like that?

[02:34:23.100 --> 02:34:24.260]
I tell you who put them over the top.

[02:34:24.420 --> 02:34:24.840]
You know who it is?

[02:34:25.100 --> 02:34:25.240]
Hope.

[02:34:25.720 --> 02:34:27.400]
Stubots. A real wiener.

[02:34:27.960 --> 02:34:29.500]
7.63 on the poll.

[02:34:29.500 --> 02:34:31.940]
What public figures death affected you the most?

[02:34:32.420 --> 02:34:33.500]
John F. Kennedy, 197.

[02:34:34.760 --> 02:34:35.780]
John Lennon, 85.

[02:34:36.220 --> 02:34:36.760]
They learn hard.

[02:34:37.080 --> 02:34:37.400]
57.

[02:34:37.940 --> 02:34:41.500]
It just leaves me, I don't know, I get spilky's looking at it on the screen.

[02:34:42.080 --> 02:34:42.620]
They learn hard.

[02:34:42.960 --> 02:34:43.940]
Phil Harman, 47.

[02:34:44.140 --> 02:34:44.980]
Bob Lieber, 27.

[02:34:45.340 --> 02:34:46.580]
Diana, 24.

[02:34:47.140 --> 02:34:48.160]
John Belushi, 23.

[02:34:48.260 --> 02:34:49.260]
I'm only going to do 20 or more.

[02:34:49.620 --> 02:34:50.500]
Kurt Cobain, 21.

[02:34:50.640 --> 02:34:51.520]
And Bob, Kennedy, 20.

[02:34:51.520 --> 02:34:52.900]
After that kind of small potatoes.

[02:34:53.760 --> 02:34:56.100]
How could Marlon Brando only have, well, first of all,

[02:34:56.120 --> 02:34:57.100]
why would that affect you that much?

[02:34:57.200 --> 02:34:58.560]
He was, he was, he was 600 pounds.

[02:34:58.900 --> 02:35:00.120]
He was in grotesque.

[02:35:00.200 --> 02:35:02.240]
He was trying to kill himself with food anyway, right?

[02:35:02.580 --> 02:35:04.480]
Stop making movies long time hence.

[02:35:04.720 --> 02:35:06.120]
Yeah. Old news.

[02:35:07.440 --> 02:35:08.320]
I mean, what's the point of time?

[02:35:08.400 --> 02:35:09.500]
100 years ago he was great.

[02:35:09.700 --> 02:35:11.700]
He can't live in the past forever.

[02:35:11.900 --> 02:35:14.660]
What are why are we going to make your drink your service to his plate?

[02:35:15.120 --> 02:35:17.040]
Frank Sarabino and the Palm Beach Post writes,

[02:35:17.260 --> 02:35:19.200]
time for Limbaugh and colder to be model citizens.

[02:35:19.780 --> 02:35:21.560]
You know, I reread this during the break

[02:35:21.560 --> 02:35:22.680]
and you know something about that area.

[02:35:22.800 --> 02:35:23.120]
It's crap.

[02:35:23.660 --> 02:35:26.020]
Well, what do you expect by a communist in the Palm Beach Post?

[02:35:26.180 --> 02:35:27.240]
Well, give us a hint of it.

[02:35:27.340 --> 02:35:28.540]
And all of them, they suck.

[02:35:29.120 --> 02:35:31.720]
And they suck and they're like hypocrites and, you know,

[02:35:31.920 --> 02:35:34.660]
they don't know the rest and they're quits wasting all of our time

[02:35:34.660 --> 02:35:36.700]
with your inability to follow the law.

[02:35:37.520 --> 02:35:39.320]
Robert Scheer, you're either here, Frank Sarabino

[02:35:39.320 --> 02:35:40.900]
and the Palm Beach Post are Robert Scheer.

[02:35:41.200 --> 02:35:41.640]
Give us Robert.

[02:35:42.080 --> 02:35:43.920]
He was a graceful attack on the New York Times.

[02:35:44.120 --> 02:35:45.000]
And his usual Robert is.

[02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:46.720]
Absolutely correct sir.

[02:35:46.840 --> 02:35:49.060]
He said the Bush administration's g-hot against newspapers

[02:35:49.060 --> 02:35:52.140]
that report on a secret program to monitor the personal banking records

[02:35:52.140 --> 02:35:55.000]
of unsuspecting citizens is more important than the original story.

[02:35:55.860 --> 02:35:58.500]
For what the President and his spokesman are once again asserting is that the

[02:35:58.500 --> 02:36:02.300]
prosecution of this ill-defined, open-ended war on terror inevitably comes

[02:36:02.300 --> 02:36:06.900]
basic democratic rights in general and the constitutionally enshrined freedom of the press in particular.

[02:36:07.500 --> 02:36:08.860]
The stakes are very high here.

[02:36:09.200 --> 02:36:12.800]
We've already been told that we must put up with official lies about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.

[02:36:12.800 --> 02:36:16.980]
The unprecedented torture of prisoners of war and a massive electronic eavesdropping

[02:36:16.980 --> 02:36:18.620]
program in other invasions of privacy.

[02:36:19.020 --> 02:36:23.540]
Now the target is more basic, the freedom of the press report on such nefarious government activities.

[02:36:24.100 --> 02:36:27.360]
The argument and defensiveness have solved on freedom is the familiar refrain of dictators

[02:36:27.360 --> 02:36:30.600]
wannabe and real who grasp her power at the expense of democracy.

[02:36:31.020 --> 02:36:35.040]
We're in a war with an enemy so powerful and devious that we can't afford the safeguard of transparent

[02:36:35.040 --> 02:36:35.980]
accountable governance.

[02:36:36.400 --> 02:36:39.180]
We're at war with a bunch of people who want to hurt the United States of America

[02:36:39.180 --> 02:36:41.980]
and for people to leak that program for a newspaper to publish it,

[02:36:41.980 --> 02:36:43.840]
there's great harm to the United States of America,

[02:36:43.840 --> 02:36:44.700]
but set on Monday.

[02:36:45.140 --> 02:36:48.600]
The bunch of people, butchers, were fighting, was originally believed to be those behind the

[02:36:48.600 --> 02:36:51.780]
9-11 attacks specifically of Somal Bin Laden and is decentralized

[02:36:51.780 --> 02:36:53.360]
al-Qaeda terrorist organization.

[02:36:53.820 --> 02:36:58.040]
He had pushed, propped by the neocon, click, quickly expanded this war beyond what should

[02:36:58.040 --> 02:37:01.160]
have been a worldwide manhunt throughout Kite operatives into an open-ended document

[02:37:01.160 --> 02:37:07.100]
of Saudi Hussein's Iraq, which is we know from the 9-11 commission report had nothing to do with al-Qaeda or 9-11.

[02:37:07.620 --> 02:37:11.960]
In fact, if the media or Congress had aggressively pursued the truth earlier, rather than being overwashed,

[02:37:11.960 --> 02:37:14.580]
and then being overwhelmed by the shock of 9-11, anti-US terrorists of every

[02:37:14.580 --> 02:37:19.240]
strait would not now be swarming over Iraq, no-with the degenerating situation in Afghanistan,

[02:37:19.720 --> 02:37:22.760]
and the enhanced power of religious fanatics throughout the Middle East from Tehran to Gaza,

[02:37:23.160 --> 02:37:26.360]
post such threats to peace if a fully informed public at Elders' President in check.

[02:37:26.860 --> 02:37:31.420]
Even today, the Bush administration continues to place the situation in Iraq in the war on terror framework,

[02:37:31.760 --> 02:37:36.720]
instead of acknowledging the primary role of religious and nationalist passions unleashed by the unborn of the US invasion.

[02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:42.660]
As Bush has continued to stretch it to cover all of his leadership failings, the war on terror has become a meaningless phrase

[02:37:42.660 --> 02:37:45.200]
to be exploited for the political convenience of the moment.

[02:37:45.800 --> 02:37:50.400]
Terrorism, which had been treated clinically as a dangerous pathology, threatening all modern societies,

[02:37:50.760 --> 02:37:56.000]
instead has been seized upon as an all-purpose propaganda opportunity for consolidating this administration's political power.

[02:37:56.440 --> 02:38:00.700]
In such a situation, the press's role as a conduit of both information and debate is more essential than ever.

[02:38:00.700 --> 02:38:06.380]
Freedom of the press enshrined in our constitution of time when our fragile nation was besieged by enemies of the new republic

[02:38:06.380 --> 02:38:11.640]
is not an indulgence to be allowed in safe periods, but rather an indispensable tool for keeping ourselves safe.

[02:38:11.920 --> 02:38:15.860]
That's just the point that Vice President Dick Cheney, the high priest of excessive secrecy,

[02:38:16.160 --> 02:38:20.960]
even in the most of manner, such as refusing to reveal the content of his negotiation with Enron Lobby's

[02:38:20.960 --> 02:38:23.860]
and Premier of the Administration's Energy Policy, is been on obscuring.

[02:38:24.280 --> 02:38:28.300]
Some in the press, in particular, the New York Times have made the job of defending the ends for their terrorist attacks

[02:38:28.300 --> 02:38:31.620]
more difficult to say, Cheney, all but calling the newspaper Traderus.

[02:38:31.940 --> 02:38:35.660]
How convenient to leave out the Wall Street Journal, which editorally supports the administration,

[02:38:35.940 --> 02:38:40.240]
which also covered this latest example of Bush's abuse of power in its news pages on the same day?

[02:38:40.800 --> 02:38:44.160]
The administration's attack on the Times' effect is not really about national security,

[02:38:44.520 --> 02:38:48.860]
but rather follows a domestic political agenda that requires attacking free media to dare to offer criticism.

[02:38:49.420 --> 02:38:54.260]
On Monday following the pattern, Cheney also attacked the Times earlier disclosure that the NSA had simply ignored

[02:38:54.260 --> 02:38:56.900]
the legal requirement of court warrants and monitoring telephone calls.

[02:38:56.900 --> 02:39:00.640]
I think that is a disgrace, he said, at the time, is winning a period of surprise for the story.

[02:39:00.900 --> 02:39:05.600]
What is truly a disgrace, though, is an administration that's consistently deceived the public about its intentions,

[02:39:05.940 --> 02:39:10.480]
in which continues to shamefully exploit post-911 fears to ensure its grip on the body politic.

[02:39:11.320 --> 02:39:12.480]
Couldn't have put it better myself.

[02:39:12.760 --> 02:39:15.580]
Let's go on Bobby's here, a little bit too liberal for the LA Times.

[02:39:17.320 --> 02:39:19.400]
Twenty before two, we're going to make that 800 or what.

[02:39:19.500 --> 02:39:23.280]
If we do, I think, man, no tardy, no holdness back then.

[02:39:23.720 --> 02:39:24.660]
Get out the party favors.

[02:39:25.500 --> 02:39:27.760]
Seven seventy five. I think we're alive, baby.

[02:39:28.020 --> 02:39:29.440]
I think the three horses alive.

[02:39:30.160 --> 02:39:33.840]
And it's thundering, and man, I tell you, it's a little on the murky side out there.

[02:39:33.860 --> 02:39:35.140]
I think it's going to rain like a...

[02:39:35.140 --> 02:39:35.940]
I think this...

[02:39:35.940 --> 02:39:36.060]
Huh?

[02:39:36.260 --> 02:39:36.820]
You're too, I think.

[02:39:36.900 --> 02:39:38.620]
Well, that's because God is pretty p-oed.

[02:39:38.700 --> 02:39:41.340]
You know, that's why we handle those floods in Round Washington, DC area.

[02:39:41.700 --> 02:39:44.480]
God has pissed off at the bush crowded than fascists.

[02:39:45.160 --> 02:39:49.180]
He said, didn't you people learn your lesson from Adolf Hitler, from the Nazis and WWII and Nazi Germany?

[02:39:49.360 --> 02:39:50.220]
Did you learn your lesson?

[02:39:50.660 --> 02:39:52.320]
Dabbling with fascism made the way to go.

[02:39:52.920 --> 02:39:54.600]
Unless, of course, your name is Phil Hensjo Batista.

[02:39:54.900 --> 02:39:56.280]
Then it's okay. Isn't that correct?

[02:39:57.020 --> 02:39:57.220]
C.

[02:39:59.100 --> 02:40:00.920]
141. I think we're going to make this 800, man.

[02:40:01.020 --> 02:40:03.180]
And if we do, then Evan can come on at, you know, two o'clock.

[02:40:03.320 --> 02:40:04.720]
Otherwise, we'll have to stay on here longer.

[02:40:05.560 --> 02:40:08.460]
Seven seventy eight. We need twenty to ninety minutes.

[02:40:08.640 --> 02:40:11.160]
That's just barely over one minute. That's child's play, right?

[02:40:11.620 --> 02:40:12.000]
Right. Right.

[02:40:12.360 --> 02:40:13.280]
How about you even a big O?

[02:40:13.500 --> 02:40:13.740]
Oh!

[02:40:13.840 --> 02:40:15.840]
To do that. Well, if you had that main listeners.

[02:40:16.420 --> 02:40:18.060]
Hey, if you're a cigar smoker, I'd like to hear...

[02:40:18.060 --> 02:40:21.000]
See that? Thinking about that ten major business again.

[02:40:21.140 --> 02:40:25.120]
I'd like to kick back with a good premium brand and be here as cigars by Tony Burrani is for you.

[02:40:25.640 --> 02:40:29.880]
These hard to find cigars are made with first grade tobacco processed in ages up to ten years.

[02:40:30.220 --> 02:40:31.380]
In fact, as old as this copy.

[02:40:31.900 --> 02:40:35.760]
But he is a real boutique cigar maker specializing in small backs hard to find tobacco.

[02:40:36.180 --> 02:40:40.280]
But he had gold of flagship lion gets a ninety one rating by cigar, fission, other cigar, and cider.

And a nine point one rating by Schmolk Magazine.

[02:40:42.940 --> 02:40:47.160]
This rich flavored well balanced full body Nicaragua and cigars got earthy hints of dark rose coffee.

[02:40:47.160 --> 02:40:48.900]
Chocolate, spice, and pepper flavors.

[02:40:49.280 --> 02:40:51.180]
Also be sure to check out their beehive the sale.

[02:40:51.520 --> 02:40:57.060]
The sale is the hottest release cigar in last ten months. It gets a high rating of ninety one by fission, other cigar, and cider magazine.

[02:40:57.660 --> 02:40:58.660]
It's a powerful cigar.

[02:40:59.040 --> 02:41:02.540]
It'll tear your lungs out, your tongue, your cheeks, your gums, everything.

[02:41:02.820 --> 02:41:04.440]
With complex notes of leather, earth, and pepper.

[02:41:04.820 --> 02:41:07.800]
They're finished as long and full body with additional spice and an order charred wood.

[02:41:08.100 --> 02:41:10.640]

just mention my name. You'll save forty percent off the cost of all your beehive cigars.

[02:41:14.460 --> 02:41:18.100]
Just tell me that ancient neorodgers, 20 to call, 1-800-35-Bahir.

[02:41:18.340 --> 02:41:21.640]
That's 1-800-35-BAHI.

[02:41:21.940 --> 02:41:22.240]
A.

[02:41:22.720 --> 02:41:25.100]
This is Neorodgers.

[02:41:25.300 --> 02:41:29.120]
Yes. This is 5-16-2-A-K.

[02:41:31.220 --> 02:41:33.900]
Coulter is a fascist party dog.

[02:41:34.480 --> 02:41:36.700]
Coulter is a fascist party dog.

[02:41:37.280 --> 02:41:39.500]
Coulter is a fascist party dog.

[02:41:39.900 --> 02:41:42.320]
Whose museur hate on you, the you.

[02:41:42.320 --> 02:41:45.040]
Seizing hate calls me or the you.

[02:41:45.300 --> 02:41:47.420]
Well, we live in a free country.

[02:41:47.960 --> 02:41:50.560]
That always brags about being free.

[02:41:50.880 --> 02:41:53.360]
Imagine how frustrating it can be.

[02:41:53.820 --> 02:41:56.340]
I can't say a word at the game with C.

[02:41:56.820 --> 02:42:01.960]
Coulter ain't a woman, and a man, with an atom's apple and giant hands.

[02:42:02.440 --> 02:42:04.320]
Coulter ain't a woman, and a man's.

[02:42:04.880 --> 02:42:07.440]
But that will hurt you on, come on.

[02:42:07.800 --> 02:42:09.740]
That will hurt you on.

[02:42:09.740 --> 02:42:12.720]
Well, and it's a good Republican.

[02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:15.820]
Two likes to flash her skinny gants.

[02:42:16.080 --> 02:42:18.460]
With no background, all she can do.

[02:42:18.940 --> 02:42:21.520]
Is lie on her back and say, kill the Jews.

[02:42:21.940 --> 02:42:24.140]
Coulter is a right-wing, partisan tank.

[02:42:24.400 --> 02:42:26.880]
Kill a mini-skirt and island wind.

[02:42:27.500 --> 02:42:29.660]
Nothing bad will ever happen to him.

[02:42:30.040 --> 02:42:32.500]
Cause evil always wins you, then.

[02:42:33.120 --> 02:42:34.780]
Evil always wins.

[02:42:35.480 --> 02:42:38.180]
Well, when she's on TV you fools.

[02:42:38.180 --> 02:42:41.020]
Blankly stare with a little drool.

[02:42:41.200 --> 02:42:43.560]
And laugh along with the hateful swell.

[02:42:44.080 --> 02:42:46.660]
A partisan pundit side choke fill.

[02:42:47.100 --> 02:42:49.220]
Coulter is a fascist party dog.

[02:42:49.840 --> 02:42:52.100]
Coulter is a fascist party dog.

[02:42:52.620 --> 02:42:54.900]
Coulter is a fascist party dog.

[02:42:55.200 --> 02:42:58.280]
Whose muse are made on you, who you see.

[02:42:58.840 --> 02:43:00.180]
The hateful spew.

[02:43:00.880 --> 02:43:03.180]
You, you, you, you.

[02:43:05.840 --> 02:43:06.680]
You bitch.

[02:43:06.680 --> 02:43:08.200]
You, you, you.

[02:43:08.720 --> 02:43:09.040]
Absolutely.

[02:43:09.860 --> 02:43:10.500]
It's 146.

[02:43:10.640 --> 02:43:11.900]
We only need just a few votes.

[02:43:11.900 --> 02:43:12.620]
We got 787.

[02:43:12.860 --> 02:43:14.020]
13 votes for 800.

[02:43:14.800 --> 02:43:15.320]
How do you like that?

[02:43:16.140 --> 02:43:17.520]
It's like when you go in a supermarket.

[02:43:18.300 --> 02:43:20.000]
And you put your items out there in the counter.

[02:43:20.160 --> 02:43:21.200]
And then you reach in your wallet.

[02:43:21.200 --> 02:43:23.120]
And if you've done enough shopping in your lifetime,

[02:43:23.120 --> 02:43:25.760]
you have a pretty good idea of how much it's going to be.

[02:43:25.940 --> 02:43:28.700]
Now that you pull out 220's and it's like 38, 56.

[02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:29.420]
You know what I said?

[02:43:30.140 --> 02:43:31.200]
You can do that after a while.

[02:43:31.420 --> 02:43:32.000]
I've got enough experience.

[02:43:32.160 --> 02:43:33.320]
And the same with doing this crap here.

[02:43:33.380 --> 02:43:34.140]
I mean, this great show.

[02:43:34.760 --> 02:43:37.100]
Weenak, can you imagine how far we'd be over a thousand right now

[02:43:37.100 --> 02:43:39.120]
if Eric wouldn't have screwed us up last night real bad?

[02:43:39.420 --> 02:43:40.600]
Yeah, but what difference would that make?

[02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.260]
No, but that made it more of a challenge today just to get to the 800.

[02:43:43.340 --> 02:43:44.260]
Which we haven't got there yet.

[02:43:44.260 --> 02:43:45.640]
And it's thundering out there, man.

[02:43:45.680 --> 02:43:47.160]
And the rain, I'm sure, is going to be coming down.

[02:43:47.580 --> 02:43:48.240]
Oh, man.

[02:43:48.680 --> 02:43:49.900]
I may have to take my umbrella.

[02:43:50.820 --> 02:43:52.880]
Now that all the guys are wearing pink shirts,

[02:43:52.880 --> 02:43:54.640]
is it okay to buy a pink umbrella?

[02:43:54.960 --> 02:43:55.580]
Like a parasol?

[02:43:55.920 --> 02:43:57.460]
Yeah, with thrill around the edges.

[02:43:57.540 --> 02:43:59.920]
Yeah, if you can spray your arms with aerosol,

[02:44:00.020 --> 02:44:01.360]
why can't you clear your little parasol?

[02:44:01.520 --> 02:44:02.900]
Make sure you spin it while you walk.

[02:44:03.300 --> 02:44:03.780]
Oh, yeah.

[02:44:05.920 --> 02:44:07.640]
That would have been good this last Sunday.

[02:44:09.040 --> 02:44:09.400]
789.

[02:44:09.760 --> 02:44:10.900]
Oh, yeah, on the Pride Day.

[02:44:11.340 --> 02:44:13.300]
I'm going to have to change the name of that to shame day.

[02:44:13.780 --> 02:44:16.480]
Because many of us are ashamed when, at any rate.

[02:44:17.020 --> 02:44:19.880]
Most national security experts of all stripes say America is losing the world.

[02:44:19.880 --> 02:44:22.120]
And the war on terror, according to a COS news article,

[02:44:22.360 --> 02:44:24.560]
I'd hit the wires today by Bob Deans.

[02:44:25.060 --> 02:44:27.300]
He says the US is losing its fight against terrorism

[02:44:27.300 --> 02:44:29.400]
and the Iraq war is the biggest reason why more than

[02:44:29.400 --> 02:44:32.000]
eight of 10 American terrorism and national security experts

[02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:33.460]
conclude in a poll release yesterday.

[02:44:33.900 --> 02:44:36.440]
One participant in the survey, a former CIA official

[02:44:36.440 --> 02:44:38.780]
who described himself as a conservative Republican,

[02:44:39.360 --> 02:44:41.320]
said the war on Iraq has provided global terrorist groups

[02:44:41.320 --> 02:44:44.520]
with a recruiting bananza, a valuable training ground,

[02:44:44.520 --> 02:44:46.320]
and a strategic beachhead of the crossroads

[02:44:46.320 --> 02:44:47.900]
of the Oral Ridge Persian Gulf in Turkey.

[02:44:47.900 --> 02:44:50.400]
The traditional land bridge linking the Middle East to Europe.

[02:44:50.960 --> 02:44:52.700]
The war in Iraq broke our back in the war on terror,

[02:44:52.820 --> 02:44:55.800]
so the former official Michael Schoier, the author of Imperial Hubert,

[02:44:55.960 --> 02:44:59.560]
say popular book, highly critical of the Bush administration's anti-terrorism efforts.

[02:44:59.900 --> 02:45:03.100]
It has made everything more difficult and the threat more existential.

[02:45:03.940 --> 02:45:06.120]
Schoier, a former counter-terrorist, my expert with the CIA,

[02:45:06.360 --> 02:45:08.480]
is one of a hundred national security and terrorism enlist

[02:45:08.480 --> 02:45:11.360]
who were surveyed this spring for the poll by foreign policy magazine

[02:45:11.900 --> 02:45:15.360]
and the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank headed by John Podesta,

[02:45:15.360 --> 02:45:17.660]
who was White House chief of staff during the Clinton administration.

[02:45:18.080 --> 02:45:19.780]
Can you hear the thunder out there? Could you hear it?

[02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:23.100]
Uh-huh. Wow. Man, first time we've had this in a long time.

[02:45:23.340 --> 02:45:26.660]
I think God is cleansing those machines that would buy them new Wheeler Forza machines

[02:45:26.660 --> 02:45:27.840]
that are doing it quick.

[02:45:28.320 --> 02:45:30.200]
Of the experts queried, or can we say that,

[02:45:30.360 --> 02:45:31.960]
45 identified themselves as liberals,

[02:45:32.180 --> 02:45:35.600]
40% said they were moderates, and 31% called themselves conservatives.

[02:45:37.280 --> 02:45:38.900]
We're losing a war on terror, baby,

[02:45:39.180 --> 02:45:41.340]
and that's because we're putting all of our eggs in a wrong casket,

[02:45:41.640 --> 02:45:43.480]
and a lot of innocent people in casket too.

[02:45:43.480 --> 02:45:45.480]
And a public sits by and they're worried about the...

[02:45:46.460 --> 02:45:49.060]
Well, they've got so many of these new so-called reality shows,

[02:45:49.220 --> 02:45:51.680]
and I can't even keep track, just from the promos.

[02:45:52.520 --> 02:45:56.600]
Treasure hunt, and then they've got all these spin-offs now in American Idol,

[02:45:56.800 --> 02:45:59.380]
and maybe you're going to get voted the biggest jackass in life.

[02:45:59.900 --> 02:46:01.300]
It's just amazing to me.

[02:46:01.380 --> 02:46:02.340]
It's all a new buzzword anyway.

[02:46:02.480 --> 02:46:04.380]
They're all just game shows dressed up.

[02:46:04.740 --> 02:46:07.080]
Is that what they are? They dress up as they have a pink purse all?

[02:46:07.340 --> 02:46:07.700]
Probably.

[02:46:08.160 --> 02:46:09.260]
Maybe they just have a pink pair.

[02:46:10.640 --> 02:46:11.660]
795 votes on a pull.

[02:46:11.760 --> 02:46:13.280]
We're going to make that 800 easy.

[02:46:13.440 --> 02:46:15.740]
There's another big crash of thunder.

[02:46:15.880 --> 02:46:16.500]
Can you hear it?

[02:46:16.760 --> 02:46:17.100]
Oh, look.

[02:46:18.340 --> 02:46:19.360]
Oh, my God.

[02:46:19.980 --> 02:46:21.160]
What's going on over here?

[02:46:21.580 --> 02:46:24.580]
Maybe I looked on the radar just to make sure that my life ain't in jeopardy

[02:46:24.580 --> 02:46:26.060]
speaking of a bad game show.

[02:46:26.540 --> 02:46:28.440]
Oh, and the re-show in the summer re-runs,

[02:46:28.500 --> 02:46:30.540]
you know, there's nothing worse than watching a game show

[02:46:30.540 --> 02:46:31.580]
that you already saw before.

[02:46:32.100 --> 02:46:32.260]
Right?

[02:46:32.540 --> 02:46:34.460]
Because first of all, I mean, let's see about all the time,

[02:46:34.460 --> 02:46:35.240]
which you know all the answers,

[02:46:35.240 --> 02:46:37.260]
and secondly, it's the same boring people again.

[02:46:37.500 --> 02:46:37.660]
Right.

[02:46:37.660 --> 02:46:39.600]
Now on wheelless torture,

[02:46:39.800 --> 02:46:41.380]
they're showing the re-runs from Poor Waterdale.

[02:46:42.660 --> 02:46:44.540]
798, when we get 800, it's going to be great.

[02:46:44.600 --> 02:46:46.200]
You're going to hear it, get sure you're going to hear this sound.

[02:46:46.760 --> 02:46:47.560]
And that's going to mean we got 800.

[02:46:48.220 --> 02:46:48.460]
Okay?

[02:46:49.100 --> 02:46:50.360]
How about you both of you when I said,

[02:46:50.460 --> 02:46:51.380]
let's make the wheel 800.

[02:46:51.700 --> 02:46:55.840]
Oh, there he goes again, making unrealistic expectations, you know?

[02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:56.240]
Well, I thought...

[02:46:56.240 --> 02:46:56.880]
What you both think of that?

[02:46:57.460 --> 02:46:58.640]
Oh, there he goes again, caring.

[02:46:59.400 --> 02:47:01.140]
I didn't say that I care.

[02:47:01.400 --> 02:47:01.600]
Okay.

[02:47:02.140 --> 02:47:04.040]
But you've got to admit, at least I put on a good act,

[02:47:04.080 --> 02:47:05.080]
and I pretend that I care.

[02:47:05.220 --> 02:47:05.880]
Oh, you got me convinced.

[02:47:06.500 --> 02:47:07.060]
Well, good.

[02:47:07.060 --> 02:47:08.100]
That's your actual idea of thinking.

[02:47:08.360 --> 02:47:08.640]
Oh, yeah.

[02:47:08.740 --> 02:47:09.080]
You think you're like, here, whether?

[02:47:09.400 --> 02:47:09.580]
Huh?

[02:47:09.780 --> 02:47:10.860]
Oh, yeah, you're all wrapped up.

[02:47:11.260 --> 02:47:12.920]
I'm whipped up into a frenzy about it.

[02:47:13.580 --> 02:47:14.840]
I'm almost assented about this,

[02:47:14.960 --> 02:47:16.660]
as you are about watching a restaurant network.

[02:47:17.040 --> 02:47:18.060]
Why don't you give another shot?

[02:47:18.160 --> 02:47:18.700]
You still got it?

[02:47:19.200 --> 02:47:19.960]
Uh, no.

[02:47:20.260 --> 02:47:20.780]
Look, oh, good.

[02:47:20.780 --> 02:47:21.860]
Oh, yeah, actually, I have it.

[02:47:21.960 --> 02:47:23.360]
I won't get a bag of Coke this time.

[02:47:23.740 --> 02:47:24.440]
Yeah, that's it.

[02:47:24.860 --> 02:47:26.480]
Get something that'll keep you up.

[02:47:26.540 --> 02:47:27.140]
I'm not going to say,

[02:47:27.140 --> 02:47:27.880]
get a bag of Coke.

[02:47:27.880 --> 02:47:30.760]
Only a druggy like George will make some kind of a comment like that on the year.

[02:47:30.880 --> 02:47:32.280]
I would tell you that off the year.

[02:47:32.960 --> 02:47:34.200]
798, we need two more votes.

[02:47:34.340 --> 02:47:35.420]
Come on, I want to be...

[02:47:37.060 --> 02:47:39.260]
When I said, oh, I'm looking at we got the 800 now.

[02:47:40.020 --> 02:47:40.300]
See?

[02:47:40.680 --> 02:47:41.720]
You see how it works on there?

[02:47:41.720 --> 02:47:43.460]
There's the phone ring, and I wonder what that all that is.

[02:47:43.800 --> 02:47:44.720]
Don't tell me I got a package.

[02:47:44.920 --> 02:47:45.640]
What day of the week is it?

[02:47:45.700 --> 02:47:46.120]
It's Thursday?

[02:47:46.680 --> 02:47:46.960]
Yeah.

[02:47:47.180 --> 02:47:49.360]
Maybe it's a call for my friends with my Blackberry.

[02:47:49.540 --> 02:47:50.800]
Do you think, when that being fantastic?

[02:47:51.140 --> 02:47:51.920]
That would be spectacular.

[02:47:52.320 --> 02:47:52.600]
Wow.

[02:47:52.960 --> 02:47:53.860]
I wouldn't hold my breath.

[02:47:53.980 --> 02:47:55.700]
Although it is thundering and like, at the end of the year.

[02:47:55.860 --> 02:47:55.960]
I hear it.

[02:47:56.740 --> 02:47:57.020]
Wow.

[02:47:57.260 --> 02:47:58.700]
I better run to lunch real quick.

[02:47:59.440 --> 02:48:00.640]
152 at 560, nobody.

[02:48:00.720 --> 02:48:01.640]
QM, Evan Cohen.

[02:48:01.840 --> 02:48:04.900]
I think this is going to be Evan's first show, like on a weekday, isn't it?

[02:48:05.060 --> 02:48:06.020]
Like in about people are awake?

[02:48:06.480 --> 02:48:07.200]
I don't know.

[02:48:07.580 --> 02:48:08.300]
I do believe so.

[02:48:09.020 --> 02:48:12.000]
And anyway, by the way, the search is still out for Troy Stratford.

[02:48:12.180 --> 02:48:13.580]
Send a search party out for Troy.

[02:48:14.020 --> 02:48:15.340]
And this is obviously not a...

[02:48:15.340 --> 02:48:17.580]
Somebody's just ringing that thing and ringing that damn phone.

[02:48:17.980 --> 02:48:19.740]
Hurricane season is here, as you well know.

[02:48:19.900 --> 02:48:21.420]
Don't wait till it's too late to protect your home.

[02:48:21.420 --> 02:48:22.980]
Hurricane Shut-A-Routlet has got your...

[02:48:22.980 --> 02:48:23.440]
Do it yourself.

[02:48:23.780 --> 02:48:24.580]
Hurricane panels.

[02:48:24.740 --> 02:48:25.720]
This is a smart way to go.

[02:48:26.180 --> 02:48:29.180]
Why bother with those big home and food win warehouses when a hurricane shut-A-Routlet

[02:48:29.180 --> 02:48:31.240]
is your complete source for hurricane protection.

Step-by-step instructions are recluded.

[02:48:50.700 --> 02:48:54.320]

I don't care if they ain't from a wreck to be used, use you to the torture.

[02:50:03.420 --> 02:50:13.920]
Because they're just laying their game, in the touch, it had to be worse with the dumb who's sane.

[02:50:16.620 --> 02:50:20.860]
All right, all right, all right.

I'm dying out of here

[02:50:22.160 --> 02:50:22.860]

And in our tail is idiot

[02:50:51.720 --> 02:50:53.240]
I don't know why

[02:50:53.240 --> 02:50:55.280]
They were swatges

[02:50:55.280 --> 02:50:57.340]

[02:50:57.340 --> 02:51:00.280]
First heard of it for you

[02:51:00.280 --> 02:51:02.900]
And with president of the fucker

[02:51:03.720 --> 02:51:04.780]
You're almost dead

[02:51:07.720 --> 02:51:09.620]
Oh, what I get to

[02:51:09.620 --> 02:51:11.920]

[02:51:22.260 --> 02:51:24.420]
Don't go down

[02:51:24.420 --> 02:51:27.840]
Lips, drum and stupid teeth

[02:51:27.840 --> 02:51:30.140]

He's even

[02:51:36.640 --> 02:51:38.760]
Dumber than me

[02:51:38.760 --> 02:51:42.220]
He's president of the fucker

[02:51:42.220 --> 02:51:44.640]
You don't care what it's all

[02:51:44.640 --> 02:51:47.200]
You got a man by her front

[02:51:47.200 --> 02:51:48.240]
And for all of the rich

[02:51:50.560 --> 02:51:51.740]
You and I

[02:51:53.840 --> 02:51:55.560]
We got a great leader

[02:51:56.900 --> 02:51:58.700]
With president of the fucker

[02:52:02.900 --> 02:52:06.900]
President of the fucker

[02:52:06.900 --> 02:52:08.380]
Okay, 159, I'm not talking here

[02:52:08.380 --> 02:52:09.420]
Evan Cohn is coming up

[02:52:09.420 --> 02:52:10.700]
And that 2-4 revolvey slot

[02:52:10.700 --> 02:52:11.820]
Let's do a good job today

[02:52:11.820 --> 02:52:13.060]
Evan, okay, they might be like

[02:52:13.060 --> 02:52:14.080]
It might be like Luke Garrett

[02:52:14.080 --> 02:52:15.660]
You know, hey, Walter, no me or Glove

[02:52:15.660 --> 02:52:16.380]
What do you think?

[02:52:16.380 --> 02:52:18.400]
Okay, no, if he doesn't find him

[02:52:18.400 --> 02:52:19.760]
Although Mad Dog's going to be doing two

[02:52:19.760 --> 02:52:22.220]
So maybe Evan will wind up doing morning drive

[02:52:22.220 --> 02:52:24.580]
Maybe Evan will be on like from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.

[02:52:24.740 --> 02:52:25.760]
Just do a good job

[02:52:25.760 --> 02:52:27.120]
And then don't talk too much about

[02:52:27.120 --> 02:52:29.800]
You know, he can talk about whatever he wants

[02:52:29.800 --> 02:52:31.220]
I'm not telling anybody how to do their show

[02:52:31.220 --> 02:52:32.760]
Just don't talk about Ira Windbag

[02:52:33.160 --> 02:52:34.800]
In fact, I think that's one of the best things

[02:52:34.800 --> 02:52:35.800]
That Evan's got going for

[02:52:35.800 --> 02:52:36.940]
And probably Curtis as well

[02:52:36.940 --> 02:52:37.740]
And even Gully

[02:52:37.740 --> 02:52:38.720]
Is that they're not Ira

[02:52:38.720 --> 02:52:39.300]
When you think?

[02:52:39.720 --> 02:52:40.540]
I'm glad you're there

[02:52:40.540 --> 02:52:41.680]
Well listen, have a splitted week

[02:52:41.680 --> 02:52:43.040]
And I'm going to see if I can

[02:52:43.040 --> 02:52:44.560]
Like a bulk up for this tough schedule

[02:52:44.560 --> 02:52:45.060]
The next week
