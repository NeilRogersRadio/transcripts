[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.860]
Get out of here.

[00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.360]
The music expressed on the previous programs are those of the host, guest, and caller.

[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.060]
Who was that?

[00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:06.600]
Joey What?

[00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.000]
Oh, gee.

[00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.020]
Staff, advertisers, or agencies.

[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.720]
Wow.

[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.560]
The biggest name.

[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.060]
You sure make me want to take a lot of call.

[00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.300]
Don't make you?

[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:15.860]
Huh?

[00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.820]
Right.

[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:18.260]
Not.

[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.140]
I hate you.

[00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:25.820]
Goodbye, Grumsville.

[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.900]
Drop dead and learn and yell it.

[00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.840]
It's much too late to confess.

[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.180]
That I ran was just for oil.

[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.060]
We hope you die of festering for oil.

[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.580]
Absolutely.

[00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.360]
You know you're pretty stinking old.

[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.460]
But you will never die, sir.

[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.400]
How about a nice refreshing dump on the waterboard?

[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.060]
That your pals had black water asked for.

[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.320]
All right.

[00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.720]
And there were many unknowns, and no, you didn't know that most people.

[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.720]
You're unknowing.

[00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:08.580]
Go to the Germans about your plan for concentration camps.

[00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.920]
Your pen just on, your agency has never been there.

[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.460]
Just like push on down, you're a failure in disguise.

[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.760]
The whole danger of danger.

[00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.520]
So I just think of one about Brady Quinn's, I'm sorry, Tom Brady's head on Brady Quinn's

[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.800]
body.

[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.540]
That's my new goal.

[00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.620]
A designer, you know, can be old Doc Frankenstein there.

[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.660]
10 out of 2 at 5, 60 WQM happy Wednesday.

[00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.260]
And remember 15, it's WW.

[00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.040]
It's Woodbuy Wednesday.

[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.740]
I mean, George is going to be putting up that new poll for tomorrow, even though I already

[00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:42.360]
sent it along.

[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.800]
Or not.

[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.480]
Or maybe he'll just be in the drunken stupor by that time this afternoon.

[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.680]
Sure.

[00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.140]
Or maybe he'll be up at Gulfstream with a hot machine mom, but I doubt it.

[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.920]
We'll get to that.

[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.680]
So anyway, I was googling right before the show too, and you interrupted my googling

[00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.840]
there.

[00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.960]
I was finding some really interesting.

[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.240]
You know, if you Google almost anything and you figure, oh, it can't possibly be on

[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.680]
there, you know, Brady Quinn shirtless.

[00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.360]
I just, I just Google it.

[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.700]
I just to see if there was like any pictures.

[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.400]
Wow.

[00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:10.840]
Well, anyway.

[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.600]
So I actually Tom Brady from the chin down, he ate nothing.

[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.620]
You know, he's got a really weak body.

[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.480]
I just mentioned that for you, Fags.

[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.700]
I mean, are you ladies out there?

[00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.160]
Here's some really great news for all of us fat people, or it's always trying to rationalize

[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.540]
our aberrant, unacceptable, self-destructive behavior.

[00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.020]
Two tablespoons full of dark chocolate a day is good for your health.

[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.780]
The new study is fun.

[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.280]
They keep coming up with these new studies.

[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.580]
If you drink like a gallon of wine every day, and you drink like any, like 10 tubs of dark chocolate,

[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.160]
the sweet treat has a similar biochemical effect to aspirin, and can reduce the likelihood

[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.000]
of blood clotting.

[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.120]
You won't be saying, oil clot or oil clog.

[00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.260]
Researchers at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and Bloomberg School of

[00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.920]
Puba Health made the discovery when 139 people were disqualified from a larger study looking

[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.240]
at the effects of aspirin on blood platelets.

[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.760]
These offenders, or at all, are going to be good grips and they could just vanish.

[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.240]
Should that have been platelets?

[00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.360]
I beg your pardon?

[00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:12.080]
Never mind.

[00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.180]
Blood platelets.

[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.380]
Are you interrupting and correcting me again?

[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.260]
No, it was Josh.

[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.220]
These offenders were told to refrain from indulging in a number of foods known to affect platelet

[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.800]
activity including chocolate, but they could not break their habit.

[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.600]
Professor Diane Becker said, what these chocolate offenders taught us is that the chemical

[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.820]
and cocoa beans has a biochemical effect similar to aspirin and reducing platelet

[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:39.760]
clumping or flatlet, which can be fatal if it clot forms and blocks the blood vessel causing a heart attack.

[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.580]
And you'll be squealing.

[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.880]
I'm dying over here.

[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.740]
Researchers have known for nearly two decades that dark chocolate and lower blood pressure has

[00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.220]
got other beneficial effects on blood flow.

[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.580]
I'm going to give me some dark chocolate right now.

[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.440]
The latest findings which will be presented at the American Heart Association's annual

[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.600]
Scientific Sessions in Chicago identified the effect of normal everyday doses of chocolate

[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.560]
found in ordinary foods.

[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.260]
What does that mean?

[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.320]
Normal everyday doses of chocolate found in ordinary foods like what?

[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.820]
I give up.

[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.260]
Putting?

[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.000]
I want a list.

[00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.680]
Yellow pudding?

[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:14.700]
My coffee every morning?

[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.420]
Eating a little bit of chocolate or having a drink of hot cocoa, see there you go, is part of a regular diet.

[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.640]
It's probably good for personal health.

[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.120]
So long as people don't eat too much of it and too much of the kind would lots of butter and sugar

[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.480]
Professor Becker said, wow, how do you like that?

[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.460]
So the bottom line is the Desmond Baker.

[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.200]
It's good for you and my brother.

[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.140]
Eat lots of cocoa.

[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.160]
Anyway, moving along, oh, it got some bad news all the way.

[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.640]
You have no idea who she was, which shows you how out of touch you are.

[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:41.140]
That's right.

[00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.420]
I don't know when it's supposed to be out of touch.

[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.920]
I'm looking at that shirtless series of pictures of Brady Quinn.

[00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.600]
I'm thinking out of it to be in touch with that.

[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.520]
But anyway, that's what happens when you get to be a horny old fag, man.

[00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.200]
You look at something like that and you say, wow, look at that.

[00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.520]
And some of you people think there's a god?

[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:05.760]
Oh, I look in the mirror and I see me sitting here in my boxer shorts with this big gut hanging out like grotesque.

[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.320]
And then I look at that picture and I think there's a god created both of us.

[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:10.040]
I don't think so.

[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.980]
Anyway, athlete range who's fighting against the king, segregated schools launch day historic political career that took her to

[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.720]
city hall, Tallahassee in Washington died last night of cancer.

[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.280]
Family said she was 91.

[00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.680]
Who?

[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.400]
Athlete range.

[00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.980]
She was a great local black lady activist.

[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:34.180]
Range went from cleaning railroad cars and segregated Miami to advising the White House and scores a state local power brokers.

[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.340]
In the 1960s, she became the first African American to serve on the Miami City Commission.

[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:46.180]
Next decades are become the first black and woman in Florida history to serve in a high ranking state government post as director of the Department of Community Affairs.

[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.100]
And former president Jim McCarter reported her to serve on the national railroad passenger corporation.

[00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:57.540]
A power broker herself ranged launched the careers of today's leaders including former US representative Carrie Meek.

[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.420]
She knew more about politics than anyone I know Meek said last night.

[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.080]
She taught me humility first and foremost.

[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.920]
She taught me to go out and talk with little people in the community who know what else to thought about.

[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.340]
She took me to places in the community where other people didn't go.

[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.880]
Everyone from US presidents down courted ranges favor they knew she could bring in the vote when it counted in a close election.

[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.680]
She helped metro rail become reality while nobody's perfect.

[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.460]
And another close referendum she led the fight to defeat a proposed property tax rollback.

[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:23.500]
Remember that?

[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.720]
Nope.

[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.300]
Yeah you do when I was given all the credit from that goofball I used to do the traffic or whatever.

[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.020]
Oh yeah that.

[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.240]
The Dave Gouffal.

[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.140]
Even in her later, you know that Joey G. Call was really funny for about 10 seconds.

[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:43.040]
Even in her later years she continued to mentor up and coming from a political aspirin like the late art teal and former...

[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.540]
County Commissioner Barbara Kerry Schueller.

[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.580]
She did so many things to improve the quality of life.

[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.300]
You can't point to one thing Kerry Schueller said.

[00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.540]
She took us into the 21st century.

[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.440]
This tall visibly frail and with a barely audible voice.

[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.860]
This fall visibly frail with a barely audible voice.

[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.040]
Range campaign for Audrey Edmondson during the race to retain her seat on the date County Commission.

[00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.360]
She also advised Michelle spends Jones a current Miami City Commissioner.

[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:14.520]
It goes on and on a great life and she was a great lady and she's dead.

[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.800]
She was 91 though and that's certainly old enough.

[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.700]
Unless you're 90 and a half you know.

[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.780]
I guess my mother figured 91 wasn't old enough.

[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.920]
I kept trying to tell her 90 was old enough.

[00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.360]
700 and say oh we got to do yesterdays.

[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.680]
Pull 1892 votes.

[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.220]
That is impressive isn't it?

[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:32.680]
Yeah sure whatever.

[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.700]
Of course we had over 16 hundred during the show but that was a pretty heavy duty.

[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.360]
Who's the biggest foe of the mall?

[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:42.760]
No contest 1892 was the total and Rush Limbaugh had almost 40% of them.

[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.600]
749 for Pill Poppin.

[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.420]
Fony Baloney fat ass rush.

[00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.200]
Reverend Ted Haggard had 281.

[00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:51.920]
He just wanted a massage it.

[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.360]
Bill O'Reilly 204.

[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.220]
Dr. Phil was right on Bill's ass all the way through.

[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.600]
They were neck and neck nose to nose as to ass.

[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.560]
193 for the anxious Fony Baloney Dr. Phil.

[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:02.820]
Oprah had 104.

[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.940]
I'm glad to see she broke the century mark.

[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.880]
That untoweled Fony bitch.

[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.920]
Fennass governor jab bush 96.

[00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.440]
One good thing about this show is we don't even call people names you know.

[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.360]
Like what?

[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.860]
Jesse Jackson 66 like Fennass governor.

[00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:19.320]
I hate this poll only 51.

[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.020]
A mere 2.6% on nearly 1900 votes.

[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.900]
That is a real feather in my crap.

[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.760]
A Miss Mark Foley she had 48.

[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.480]
Talked about 147 right on Mark's ass.

[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.760]
Julie Bremen had 34 and Nancy Grace Fren had only 19.

[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.420]
That's really surprising.

[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:42.960]
Even this audience just figure she small potatoes they don't care about her or or they like her a lot.

[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.280]
I was I can't imagine that.

[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.000]
She's small potatoes.

[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.540]
Yeah nobody watched.

[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.760]
She's like cranky potentially she's small potatoes.

[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.740]
Fort TV is for like women.

[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.700]
Which religious group is much she's not I'm just on court TV.

[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.440]
She's on headlight news now.

[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:55.700]
Yeah.

[00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:56.860]
She's all she's everywhere.

[00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.780]
She's like a gigantic malignant tumor.

[00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.440]
It's all over your cable and all over your antenna.

[00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:02.440]
It's all over the place.

[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.600]
But there's a headline news.

[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:05.360]
Website.

[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:06.880]
What's in a smile?

[00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.020]
Could it be lifelong happiness?

[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.560]
And one groundbreaking.

[00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:13.960]
You know she's very nice looking at the chick there but she has no business.

[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.720]
She's like I can already tell.

[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.460]
In 10 seconds I can tell she's like one step away from Katie Kirk.

[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.080]
What a slightly darker complexion.

[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.020]
Katie you're out of your league honey.

[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.080]
You're way out of your league.

[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.040]
You're in the wrong profession now sweetheart.

[00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:31.720]
You're a new you're a newsreader like I'm a freaking professional athlete.

[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:37.560]
Shaking like a leaf like I'm a like I'm a college quarterback.

[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.160]
See there you go with that Brady Quinn crap again.

[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.100]
If Josh wouldn't have started talking about Brady Quinn.

[00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.620]
Anyway Josh didn't watch Max point which were pretty p-oated him about that.

[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.700]
Even his Russian girlfriend is seeing that.

[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:50.980]
And she ruined it.

[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.480]
And she's starting to try to ruin it for Josh.

[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.080]
All the way to that what's your name dies in the end.

[00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.780]
We didn't say which one.

[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.480]
Well actually there are two people died.

[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.920]
The 77 votes out of this pool which religious group is most malignant.

[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.660]
Of course some of the people in the audience are already know they're saying this is a repeat.

[00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.260]
Near you've done this before way you know what?

[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.840]
Too bad your mama your mama so socks in hell.

[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.240]
Okay. Too bad.

[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:19.300]
We reserve the right since they want these damn polls didn't they just tell us a couple of days ago.

[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:20.520]
They want the polls they like them.

[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:21.860]
Nothing's wrong with them keep them going.

[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.620]
Well that's it we didn't say we're going to come up with a new one every stinking day.

[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.620]
Right they said they were fine they said they said they just fine.

[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.980]
And I think this one's fine too when we're going to have over a thousand votes by the time we get out of here at two o'clock.

[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.960]
By the time I get in that cabin head for wood buying on wood buying Wednesday.

[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.660]
And George heads for his drug dealer on the corner there.

[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.720]
787 on the pool so far today.

[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.620]
Which religious group is the most malignant.

[00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:49.280]
Born again Christians 392 they blow away the Muslims.

[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.140]
See a lot of people think it's the other way around.

[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.420]
Born again Christians 392 Muslims 201.

[00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:59.480]
Science colleges are doing some do's doing surprisingly well they're a doozy they got 67.

[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.720]
I hate this pool 47 5.8%.

[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.860]
Now contents.

[00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:04.500]
Yeah.

[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:05.760]
Cry babies.

[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.160]
Wasn't that the Johnny Depp movie Cry babies?

[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.540]
Yeah was it was Bridal.

[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.320]
Yeah that's stupid as per older like a little girl.

[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.320]
Catholics 43 in Orthodox Jews 41.

[00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:17.620]
I was 799.

[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.740]
A run of urge of 800.

[00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:20.840]
I bet if I refresh it will be over 800 vote.

[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:22.480]
And it is 803.

[00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.100]
And Orthodox Jews are in last place as usual.

[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:27.900]
What are they doing at the wailing wall?

[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:28.900]
Wailing.

[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:29.740]
That's it.

[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.280]
They're wailing and they're throwing rocks at the women baby.

[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:34.780]
The raktion is a far business they can.

[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.620]
Remember the movie is far business they want to be?

[00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:36.860]
No.

[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.160]
That was a song by Luther Campbell.

[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.480]
From minutes after 10.

[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.320]
Look at that line up we got the mad dog at 2.

[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.480]
The power hour with Hank and the mad dog together.

[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.160]
4 to 5.

[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.040]
Actually that's from the QM showers.

[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.500]
5 to 7 it's the Humper solo and then at the way I'm getting no game tonight.

[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:53.520]
Oh that's bad.

[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:57.060]
Because when we have no game to fill in that time at night we put some real swill on the air.

[00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.900]
We got Hurricane Hotline at Gameworks in the shops and the sense that it plays from 7 to 9.

[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.540]
College tailgate presented by the FedEx Orange Bull 9 to 10.

[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.160]
And then Craig Mishes in for 8.8 and 9.10 to 2.

[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:09.500]
What the hell is that all about?

[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:10.700]
Eddie Kay taking a died off.

[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:11.960]
Who the hell is he think he is?

[00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:14.840]
Who the hell is he?

[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.020]
Oh he's on his way to Vegas.

[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.180]
Because I see tomorrow Eddie Kay is on from Vegas.

[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:22.780]
Boy turning Eddie Kay loose in Vegas is like turning a little kid loose in a candy shop.

[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.460]
You know what I mean?

[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:25.500]
What do you mean?

[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.900]
Like turning a horny teenager loose in the name of the day.

[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.220]
1013 at 560 WQA.

[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:34.720]
Neon God.

[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.140]
That's all rise for the new speaker of the house.

[00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:39.620]
Geldie Pelosi.

[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.820]
That ain't no doubt.

[00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:48.480]
For our first daughter of business I say we ain't gonna impeach nobody.

[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:51.860]
Because we don't have those kind of balls.

[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:52.780]
Now see here.

[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:58.520]
Now Benny used that something to say about doing some religious light now over here.

[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.060]
Stand up and spell it.

[00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.660]
I did it to do with Mrs. Speaker.

[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:03.060]
Who the hell are you?

[00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:03.960]
Well how do you know?

[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:10.040]
I am none other than Moe Howard and David represented it representing a precinct of 13 of prestigious

[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.980]
empty town in Florida.

[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.280]
Yes so.

[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.800]
I propose we were born to...

[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:16.620]
That chicken light down.

[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:21.080]
I said put that chicken light down and put your shoes back on.

[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.120]
What do you think this is?

[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:23.720]
But I was just getting to the water melon.

[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:27.480]
Were you about to say something about removing a national guard from my rack?

[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:27.900]
No.

[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:28.560]
No.

[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.900]
There ain't no national guard there.

[00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.800]
I keep trying to tell everybody not to do what they want.

[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:40.080]
I propose we removed the white and it got from our plunge of allegiance and replace it with the white and it...

[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:40.500]
...doi.

[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.820]
That was nation under...doi.

[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:43.460]
Absolutely.

[00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:44.760]
...didn't do the doi.

[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.740]
And that cheap liberty for all.

[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:47.880]
That doi.

[00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:48.240]
...doi.

[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:49.680]
That doi.

[00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:49.880]
...doi.

[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:50.140]
...doi.

[00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:52.340]
...exeterer.

[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:53.400]
...exeterer.

[00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:54.460]
...doi.

[00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:00.600]
...1018 at 560 WQM and by the way Joey G who was that last caller there on...

[00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:02.460]
...the morning show on Kenny and Bo.

[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:03.420]
Yeah.

[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:09.100]
If the jets are so great, if the pizza is so great, if everything else in the people are so great, if New York is so great...

[00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:13.120]
...and this is the same thing we want to say to all the other malcontent New Yorkers are always bitching and moaning and convincing.

[00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:14.680]
Why don't you go back to New York?

[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.300]
And that sounds like a capital idea.

[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:18.620]
Ain't that the standard line?

[00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.360]
Why are you here whining about it in New York until there?

[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.220]
See, I could be in South Florida whining about it but I'm not.

[00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:26.800]
I'm not in South Florida at all so I'm not going to complain about it.

[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.600]
As you hate it down here, why don't you go to Canada or something?

[00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:30.260]
Exactly.

[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:31.900]
That sounds like a hell of a good idea.

[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:37.020]
828 votes on the pool today and the Orthodox Jews are still holding up the rear.

[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.260]
We got some exciting news in town today baby.

[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.280]
Forget about New York.

[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:47.740]
This is a, you know, it goes to Shorya though, how far behind the state of Florida is, how in the stone age it is.

[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:53.380]
It's always the same because a bunch of drooling Bible thumping red necks basically run that state.

[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:54.760]
That's the problem with Florida.

[00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:03.340]
I mean, there's a lot of beautiful places and the palm trees and the ocean and, you know, all of these things.

[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:08.800]
But there's a lot of old, crusty, nasty and especially up to, you know, in the rest of the state.

[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:14.620]
South Florida is like a bastion of progressive thinking, you know, compared to the rest of the state.

[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:18.440]
States, first laws, Vegas, now slot machines start running in proud today.

[00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:19.180]
How do you like that?

[00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:20.520]
All right.

[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:26.460]
Moments that the way this is written in the Sun Central, it's amusing, you know, it's hysterical.

[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:32.300]
Like something, like the first automobile is going to be on a dirt road in the date county today.

[00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:33.900]
You know, I'm saying something like that, revolutionary.

[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:36.440]
Not silly.

[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:42.420]
Moments after noon today, someone will press a button and may change the face of gambling in Florida.

[00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:43.260]
We'll change.

[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:44.900]
They're going to change the face.

[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:45.960]
I wish I could do that.

[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.960]
By the way, if you Google Brady Quinn naked, you'll find some interesting things too.

[00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:53.740]
Now, what's going to come into all of that?

[00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.300]
Okay, I'm just sitting here, minding my own business right away, you start with that.

[00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.380]
What kind of a question is that?

[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:58.960]
What got you into all of that?

[00:15:59.180 --> 00:15:59.800]
Being an old fact.

[00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:01.800]
Oh, I was going to say.

[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.160]
It's just a rhetorical question.

[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.860]
Okay, we're so defensive for right now.

[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.980]
We're just going to see the look on both the Josh and mine's faces.

[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:07.800]
Like what have got you?

[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.300]
I don't want to see anyone in your face.

[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:10.820]
I want to see the look on Brady's face.

[00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:11.440]
Hey, Brady.

[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.480]
We renovated Gumpstream Park Racing in Cassini.

[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:18.920]
We'll open its doors at noon today with the state's first Las Vegas-style slot machines.

[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:19.660]
Oh, my God.

[00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:20.640]
Oh, my God.

[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:22.280]
I hope you find a good machine mine.

[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.760]
I want to go over there at noon to try it out.

[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.440]
You better cut the crap right now.

[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:27.540]
You are not going to be going over there.

[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:31.260]
In addition to which, see, this is the good thing for you guys, like I told you before, the show.

[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:36.020]
Because the Helen Dale Beach Race Track Cassini received the state's final approval yesterday

[00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:38.820]
to open with 516 traditional slots.

[00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:42.700]
Well, that's a fraction of what, you know, I mean, that pompato is going to have 1,500 nothing

[00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:43.720]
Gumpstream is going to have the same.

[00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.220]
That's the limit, I believe, thanks to your fat ass governor.

[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:49.000]
But they're opening with just 516 slot machines, man.

[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.600]
You ever going to get no machine, man?

[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:56.820]
The opening comes before Gumpstream Park even kicked off its ad campaign promoting its new venture.

[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:02.880]
Park officials anticipate that word of mouth press coverage like on this show with all of our degenerate gamblers out there.

[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.360]
And the machines' powerful lure will translate into a crowd today.

[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:11.260]
The machines' powerful lure, like there's something intrinsically evil about a slot machine, man.

[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.200]
If it's a cold dead machine, it's evil.

[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:19.460]
Let me give you a little bit of advice, okay, on your plungers out there who are like novices with a slot machines.

[00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:22.460]
Don't sit there feeding the dead machine for hours on end.

[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.560]
I learned that a long time ago, the hard way, the expensive way.

[00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.060]
Don't sit there and feed a dead machine, man.

[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:32.720]
Why not open today, said Paul McCucci, the park's president, Kuchi Kuchi Kuh.

[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:36.540]
That's what I was thinking when I saw those naked pictures there. Kuchi Kuh.

[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.120]
Thousands of people have been calling us wanting to come to the new Gulfstream.

[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.220]
We thought there was definitely a demand we're happy to be open.

[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:46.660]
And we're ecstatic that they are open, although I wish it was starting in Poppano Park, but they will later next year.

[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:53.020]
Slot's drawing power was undisplicated in Pennsylvania as that state's first slot parlors open.

[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:58.720]
Hundreds of gamblers, mostly senior citizens, or a way, waited hours in a foggy drizzle to start plucking in money.

[00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.920]
They're going to lose their social security text too bad.

[00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:08.760]
Gamblers were sitting before most of the casinos, 1100 slots within 10 minutes of Mohican sun at Polkano down on locking its doors.

[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:12.640]
At Polkano down's race track makes me want to play that Jewish Polkano's bit, which I will.

[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:18.440]
Gulfstream Park, and by the way, I've got all these, wow, I'm just got a backlog here.

[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:22.140]
I got all kinds of, like, about five discs with all kinds of stuff.

[00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:27.020]
So maybe I'll play a lot of bits today while you guys are plunging trying to find a good machine, because it is wood buying Wednesday.

[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:28.440]
Sure, I'll find a good machine, man.

[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.560]
Gulfstream Park is the first of Broward County's four paramutrials to open its slots room.

[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.840]
Marty Grawr racetrack in Casino, which you'll use to be Hollywood Greyhound track, hopes to open next month.

[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:45.440]
It's been more than two years, two long, excruciating, freaking years, this Carl Levenigan with those stupid bifogals down to the two of his nose.

[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:50.680]
It's been more than two years since a statewide referendum allowed Broward voters to decide to have traditional slots.

[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.740]
At Gulfstream Park, Marty Grawr, popular park on his track, and Dania Highly.

[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.880]
Half of every dollar generated by the slots will go to Florida Schools.

[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:02.980]
A projected $200 million dollars once each of the premutials has the maximum number of slots allowed by state law.

[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.640]
1,500 machines, man.

[00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:08.400]
The slot machines are planned.

[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.040]
Now, you guys ought to go over there just to take a look and see what they got.

[00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.280]
So you can report to us.

[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:13.480]
Yeah, go ahead, Josh.

[00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:14.400]
All right.

[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.300]
I'll be out of here at like an hour and thirty six minutes.

[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:17.240]
You can be there right in noon.

[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.540]
You'll never get close to a machine.

[00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:19.300]
I'll do a call in.

[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.080]
I'll tell you if I win.

[00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:22.180]
You'll never get even close.

[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.320]
Yeah, let's have our roving reporter out there.

[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:27.820]
Let's get one of our, like, Orlando rock solid.

[00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:30.000]
Yeah, he's a real big shot, not the eye.

[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:35.060]
The slot machines are class three gambling devices like those found in Vegas and Atlantic City.

[00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.500]
The Seminole Tribe currently has got class two slots.

[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.600]
Less liquid of bingo style machines, which I still don't understand.

[00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:41.540]
I don't want to understand.

[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:46.420]
And it's seven Florida casinos, but they're pushing to get the class three machines too, as you can well understand.

[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.180]
Gulfstream Park's casino will be open from noon to midnight today.

[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.720]
On Thursday, it'll be only open from noon to 6 p.m.

[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:57.760]
So employees can prepare for an 8 p.m. invitationally gala and invitationally gala.

[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:04.020]
The casinos regular hours will be noon to midnight from Sunday through Thursday and 2 p.m. to 2 a.m. Friday's and Saturday.

[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:05.940]
What?

[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:11.940]
No one to midnight from Sunday through Thursday and 2 p.m. to 2 a.m. Friday and Saturdays.

[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.300]
Ask me when wood buying closes.

[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:14.520]
What time does the wood buying?

[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:14.860]
Never.

[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:16.640]
Never.

[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:22.420]
If you're in the mood to plunge 24-7, baby, every day of your life 24-7.

[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:28.380]
On Christmas, on Boxing Day, on Tishibov, on Siltkha Stora, on You Name It.

[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:29.580]
They're open.

[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.400]
They're ready to steal you to give you a good time.

[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:38.000]
Actually, the last couple of months have been doing pretty well, which don't dilute yourself thinking that anybody's going to do pretty well.

[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.500]
It's just a streak, you know what I'm saying?

[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:42.840]
You go through those lucky streaks for a little while and of course you lose your ass.

[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:46.720]
But never let's go there and have a good time, like they say at your OTB.

[00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.220]
But with your head not over it.

[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:49.000]
Not a cute saying?

[00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:50.340]
That we're head not over it.

[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.600]
In other words, what that translates to is bring us all your money and go home.

[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.240]
But don't mortgage the house because then you can all come home.

[00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:59.860]
Bring us all your money, drop it off in a bag and just go, you know, so I'm curious.

[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.940]
Maybe we'll get somebody who will fax in some reports a later on.

[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.220]
We'll let him to the children.

[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.220]
Noon today, baby, slot machines.

[00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:10.820]
Those one-armed bandits and I bet your fat ass governor's probably got wild diarrhea just thinking about it.

[00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:13.100]
Oh, what do we do now? Oh my god.

[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.880]
And of course the people, the jackasses at the herald in the Sun sentinel, especially the herald.

[00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:21.760]
850 votes and of course the lottery is a really good investment.

[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.320]
Man, you know, at least with the slots, I'll say this.

[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:32.420]
At least you get a little bit of entertainment, you know, you get a little bit of fun, some action, a little bit of a light show.

[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:33.780]
What's the fun with a lottery?

[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:35.840]
I mean, unless you win something which you're not going to.

[00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:36.540]
What's the fun?

[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:37.480]
Well, you can scratch it.

[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:38.620]
Yeah, scratch this.

[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:39.100]
No.

[00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:40.960]
859 votes.

[00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:42.040]
Oh, there's Brady Quinn naked.

[00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:43.260]
I'll try scratch in that.

[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:44.540]
Scratch and stuff.

[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.680]
Which religious group is the most malignant?

[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:51.560]
Born again Christians 419, Muslims 219.

[00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:52.400]
Both sides have been closed.

[00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:55.420]
See, all them Islamophashes that they're always talking about.

[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.180]
It's the born again Christian fascist.

[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.840]
Other ones we need to be very concerned about.

[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:00.440]
Scientologists 74.

[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.940]
I hate this pull 57 6.6%.

[00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:04.240]
Too bad, probably the God Squad.

[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.220]
A bunch of Getskis.

[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:06.820]
Catholics only 47.

[00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:09.280]
I guess they never was any Crusades or any 4.

[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.740]
I hate this pull 57 6.6%.

[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:13.040]
Too bad, probably the God Squad.

[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.040]
A bunch of Getskis.

[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:15.660]
Catholics only 47.

[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:20.820]
I guess they never was any Crusades or any Inquisition or any Child Must and Priest, things like that.

[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.580]
An Orthodox Jews only 43.

[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.840]
They're small potatoes because there's like so few of them, you know.

[00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:26.940]
But I'll tell you one thing.

[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:30.840]
For a very small group like that, they sure can be real far-bicent.

[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:33.540]
The biggest name as a queen of satellites.

[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:34.820]
The biggest is neo-rogerists.

[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:37.040]
Forch-Renio 560.

[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:38.100]
You AM.

[00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:40.360]
God, your breasts are beautiful.

[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:41.720]
Hey, mom and dad.

[00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:44.840]
Give your kids the hottest action figure of the year.

[00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:47.280]
Get Mojo and the torture team.

[00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:48.100]
Go, Joe!

[00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.860]
Push Get Mojo's back and hear him bark out orders.

[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.600]
Tell us where Osama is.

[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.980]
Where are the WMDs?

[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.440]
Connect the wire to Ockman's genitals.

[00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.180]
That's right.

[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:04.820]
Get Mojo talks and he'll get the terrorists talking with cool accessories like the WaterBoards.

[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:07.680]
And the hand crank generator.

[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:08.660]
Go, Joe!

[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:15.140]
Collect all the members of Get Mojo's torture team, including Wendy the leash girl with life-life cigarettes.

[00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.900]
Get naked and get on all fours.

[00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:21.600]
And Get Mojo's faithful companion shops the attack dog.

[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.240]
Go, Joe!

[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.900]
So get your kids. Get Mojo today.

[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:30.640]
Get Mojo may be a violation of the Geneva Convention Parents' Supervisor Torture Sessions.

[00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:31.540]
Better than uncluded.

[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:33.040]
Go, Joe! Yay!

[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:38.120]
I have a feeling there's a lot of people in this radio station who would like to get Mojo.

[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:38.900]
No, no, no, no.

[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:39.380]

[00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.120]
10.30 do a Q&A.

[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.500]
Here's something we talked about weeks ago thanks to the inquirer.

[00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:47.360]
Thanks to the fact that I'm on top of all this crap.

[00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:55.840]
In a new TV interview in book, O.J. Simpson discusses how he would have committed the slangs of his ex-wife and her friend if I did it.

[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.560]
Hypothetically speaking, of course.

[00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:58.360]
Of course.

[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:03.040]
The two-part TV interview titled O.J. Simpson, if I did it, here's how it happened.

[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:06.520]
Well, air November 27th and November 29th on Fox.

[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.540]
The TV network said yesterday on Fox, a good place for it.

[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.380]
The home of everything fake.

[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:13.100]
If I did it, my ass.

[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:19.120]
O.J. Simpson in his own words tells for the first time how he would have committed the murders if he were the one responsible for the crime.

[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:25.560]
Have you ever in your life heard of anything so ludicrous, so asinine, so idiotic, so just stupid?

[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:26.340]
Not lately.

[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:28.700]
The network said.

[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:32.400]
In the two-part event, Simpson describes how he would have carried out the murders.

[00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:35.000]
He is vehemently not committing for over a decade.

[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.660]
You are so full of it, you miserable nasty murdering appreciative of you.

[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:43.520]
You phony baloney drug-doing knife wielding slimeball.

[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:46.100]
I would say that, what is that, SBag?

[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:46.780]
We can't say that.

[00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:47.700]
We'll get joist if we say SBag.

[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:49.060]
We can say scum.

[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:51.140]
We can say we biz bag.

[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:57.360]
This is an interview that no one thought whatever happened at the definitive last chapter in the travel of the century.

[00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:01.780]
Mike Darnell, executive vice president of alternative program for Fox in this statement,

[00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:06.720]
the interview conducted with book publisher Judith Regan will air just days before Simpson's new book,

[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.700]
if I did, goes on sale November 30th.

[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:09.600]
Thought 30, man!

[00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:12.660]
I wouldn't buy that if you paid me by the page to read it.

[00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.220]
Even Miss Foley wouldn't touch a page of it.

[00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:19.920]
The book hypothetically describes how the murders would have been committed than it were said.

[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:20.620]
Right.

[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:24.340]
The book is published by Regan Books and Imprint of Harper Collins publishers.

[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.960]
Simpson now lives in Kendall, of course, as we all know.

[00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:34.840]
What a sad, sad situation that all this slime eventually like, you know, filters down the Hershey highway

[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:41.220]
and winds up just trickling its way down the Florida penis, all the way to South Florida.

[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.100]
Isn't that just amazing?

[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:42.740]
Mm-hmm.

[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:45.000]
Just like Andrew Kinnan and another murderer.

[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:50.160]
In fact, let's stick OJ's ass in at Houseboat and see if we can like a snuff his ass out.

[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.940]
What is it that they load, what the blonde, what is his head?

[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.480]
Simpson now lives in Kendall, was acquitted in the criminal drama.

[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:59.380]
We know that he was later found liable in 97 in the wrongful death lawsuit filed by the goldmins

[00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:00.740]
who haven't got a dime from him, by the way.

[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:05.180]
Messages left with Simpson and as attorney Yale, Yentek Galanta were not returned last night.

[00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:06.220]
So, I do like that.

[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.680]
So the book is coming out to 30th, which is, let's see, the tomorrow is 60.

[00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:10.640]
Two weeks from tomorrow.

[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.360]
A week from tomorrow's Thanksgiving, and I won't be on either of George and Josh to cut the day off too.

[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:18.300]
See, one thing about Josh, he just says, I'm not going to be here that day.

[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.800]
I like that. I like the attitude.

[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:26.320]
Of course, you know, when you get to think slipping your ass paycheck, there will probably be a good reason for it, but nevertheless.

[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:27.300]
We learned that here.

[00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:28.340]
What?

[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.240]
He learned that here from everybody else.

[00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:30.920]
What?

[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.860]
I'm not going to be there that feels like it.

[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.720]
That's the way the QM sales will go.

[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:35.820]
Everyone on the air.

[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:36.180]
Sure.

[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:41.720]
In fact, I think I'm taking off a few days, just for the hell of it.

[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:47.200]
Not without pay, just a few days here and there, because I need a lot more time off.

[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.060]
So I can go find me a good machine, man.

[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.600]
Or maybe I can just go to South Bend and do the deep knee bends in South Bend.

[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:54.740]
See if I can find Brady Quinn.

[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.020]
Maybe he needs some companionship, you think?

[00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:57.560]
Not.

[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.620]
See, isn't that the way we all are?

[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:01.640]
That's the way we all are.

[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:05.780]
Oh, well, somebody, whoever it is that we lust for, you know, they definitely need me.

[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.740]
They need you like they need a hole in the head.

[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.020]
As the finish say, they need you like a locking cup.

[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.200]
890 votes, 89 WLS.

[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.480]
Well, I bet you got some of those jingles there.

[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.520]
How come I don't have all those jingles that I should have?

[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:22.220]
I don't know.

[00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:23.460]
Do I have your little chicken?

[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:23.720]
You better touch chicken.

[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:25.140]
I got this.

[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:26.340]
W-A-B-C!

[00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:28.640]
I got that.

[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:29.120]
Yeah.

[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:30.120]
I have that too.

[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.000]
Have the same thing you got.

[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:32.540]
No, you don't.

[00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:33.800]
You got WLS jingles.

[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:34.640]
They're on a cart somewhere.

[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:35.140]
I do.

[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:35.260]

[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:35.780]
Look for them.

[00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:36.520]
Oh, sure.

[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:41.680]
I think, at least we used to have, unless somebody ran off of them.

[00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:49.960]
Have a wonderful weekend under the U-I-O-T Miami.

[00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.220]
W-I-O-D.

[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:54.360]
Oh, I hate that stage.

[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:54.880]
Shame on.

[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.000]
Now, who was that with that Don Jiranamo?

[00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:58.960]
Who was the San-A?

[00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:00.640]
Don and Mike Blow.

[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:02.420]
Oh, yeah, from the famous Don and Mike.

[00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:03.020]
They much disappointed.

[00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:04.460]
That was Don and Mike Don drew out of it.

[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:06.880]
890 votes on the pool.

[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.460]
We'll have that thousand easy and two shakes of a lambs tail.

[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:10.500]
Why do I keep saying that lately?

[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:14.980]
You know, when I started saying that, when we were talking about the shoe fly pie and Apple

[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:16.620]
Panned Outie and you found that grotesque.

[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.720]
And don't you dare play it again by Dining Shore.

[00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:19.420]
Okay.

[00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:20.820]
Shoe fly pie.

[00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.760]
Naomi Campbell, Traveler, J.A.

[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:23.600]
We're 16th for P.

[00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:24.920]
Please, the deal talk.

[00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:28.600]
The best music, W.A.

[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:29.300]
Yes.

[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:31.560]
Oh, the best music.

[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:33.380]
The best music.

[00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:36.160]
You know, WAMO, the Lasseter worked at WLS when they went to talk.

[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:37.260]
Yeah.

[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:38.660]
It's one thing about ABC, man.

[00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:40.160]
I can't imagine why they went in the toilet.

[00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:43.640]
You know, WABC, which was the, what are the great, of course, you know, music on A.M.

[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:44.540]
It was all done at that point.

[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.200]
They had to do something.

[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:47.680]
So they went right when it was on W.A.

[00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:47.900]

[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:49.360]
W.A.

[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:55.200]
Chicago, which was one of the really classic, one of the great, great, great radio stations in

[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.000]
history of the radio business.

[00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:58.360]
Also went to talk.

[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:01.720]
Eurocular and Lil Tommy.

[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:05.760]
Lightning has almost struck twice in Lake Forest.

[00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:10.780]
I remember you reporting about the little poodle that weaved its way through the traffic

[00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:14.200]
in Lake Forest, only to be splattered by a northwestern train.

[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:18.480]
Well, a similar incident happened about a week ago involving a squirrel.

[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:22.780]
My friend and I were on our way to get some lunch in Lake Forest last Saturday,

[00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:27.060]
and we noticed a squirrel trying to weave its way across the traffic on Western Avenue.

[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:32.440]
We were in a car about 20 yards away from the squirrel, and it started to make its way across the street.

[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:39.460]
The squirrel was probably not as mobile as it could have been because its mouth was really stuffed with nuts from the park.

[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:44.440]
Oh, luckily though the squirrel scampered across traffic and my friend and I were relieved that he was safe.

[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:48.540]
Suddenly two girls who were on a bike ride appeared along the side of the street.

[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:52.140]
They were really flying when the confused squirrel jumped into their path.

[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:57.440]
The girl tried to avoid the squirrel, but he somehow hit the back tire of her bike and got caught up in the spoke.

[00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:58.380]
Oh, damn.

[00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:03.540]
Before a squirrel went around in the wheel several times before he got free and was flown on the grass.

[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:09.720]
To our surprise, the day's squirrel got to his feet and staggered away, apparently okay.

[00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:10.380]
Oh, good.

[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:15.700]
The girl who was riding the bike was a little upset, but I'm sure not as much as the squirrel.

[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:21.080]
Luckily he didn't lose his life, but he might have lost his nut.

[00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:25.100]
That's right.

[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:29.040]
There's a good message for all your kids out there, listening to life.

[00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:31.180]
You can't run real fast when you got a mouthful of nuts.

[00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.360]
Twenty-one before 11 at 5.60 W.D.2.

[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:35.440]
And we got mad dog at 2.00.

[00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:36.040]
We got the dolphins.

[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.140]
Our plan is a Minnesota this week.

[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:39.720]
I have no idea.

[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:41.680]
Boy, you are so out of touch, man.

[00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:44.100]
You probably don't even know who your buck and ears are going to lose to this week.

[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:46.320]
And I'm going to want to talk.

[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.560]
Who the hell of the Patriots playing this week?

[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:50.700]
I almost forgot who the hell they are.

[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:52.280]
Who are they playing?

[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:53.040]
Green Bay.

[00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:54.120]
Is it?

[00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:54.620]
Yeah.

[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:55.740]
Oh, good.

[00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:57.280]
I think we can kick the crap out of them.

[00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:58.500]
Let's see.

[00:30:58.680 --> 00:30:59.720]
The dolphins are playing.

[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:01.640]
Oh, I don't have any idea who the dolphins are playing.

[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:02.560]
Oh, it's Minnesota, I believe.

[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:03.080]
Yes, Minnesota.

[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:04.740]
And of course, Minnesota.

[00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:06.900]
The Patriots made mincemeat out of Minnesota.

[00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:09.580]
So probably the dolphins are when that came to and then everybody's gone.

[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:10.800]
We love the dolphins.

[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.140]
They're going all the way.

[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:13.500]
You know, we do in the Super Bowl crap.

[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:15.040]
It's the same all the time.

[00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:17.260]
People are keeping deluding themselves.

[00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:21.260]
People who are fans of a franchise that's living in the distant past, you know.

[00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:23.440]
I like the Toronto make believe.

[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:24.260]
Same thing.

[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.340]
Living in the distant past.

[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:28.680]
Back in the 60s, those four Stanley cups.

[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:30.200]
Way, way back then.

[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:31.840]
Olding remember, by old farts like me.

[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.580]
But nevertheless, hey, Lee, at least some franchises have a past, you know.

[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:38.440]
As opposed to some that don't have any past and don't have any present.

[00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:40.840]
Even Josh's team won a Super Bowl once upon a time,

[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:41.860]
which nobody believed they would.

[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:42.920]
I picked him to win it.

[00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:45.040]
And everybody said, oh, no, you're a crazy man.

[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:45.460]
No chance.

[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:46.100]
And they did.

[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:47.260]
Remember that?

[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.100]
Yeah, wouldn't that fought longer?

[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:49.200]
Yeah.

[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:49.980]
Yeah.

[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:20.520]
Yeah.

[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:21.340]
Yeah.

[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:22.240]
Yeah.

[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:24.760]
Yeah.

[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:25.400]
Yeah.

[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:25.400]

[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:25.400]

[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:25.820]
Yeah.

[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:26.560]
Yeah.

[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:27.120]
Yeah.

[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:28.380]
Yeah.

[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:28.800]
Yeah.

[00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:30.480]
Yeah.

[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:32.420]
Yeah.

[00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:32.940]
Yeah.

[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:33.320]

[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:33.780]
Yeah.

[00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:35.080]
Yeah.

[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:35.080]

[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:35.240]

[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:35.240]

[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:35.240]

[00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:35.480]
Yeah.

[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:35.580]

[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:35.580]

[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:35.580]

[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:35.580]

[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:39.520]
Yeah.

[00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:41.300]
Yeah.

[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:46.520]

[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:11.420]
Go check what we're selling here.

[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:14.440]
I wonder if Tamp Brady and Danny Quinn both were Wonder Junior jokes,

[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:24.520]
And just like both of you guys, and I'm sure we without even asking, I mean, you know, is there any doubt that if Scarlett Johansson left her panties behind like the studio there that you both be having a hissy fit

[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:31.980]
Being a brawl to see who could get to him first. Well, it's a little too to return them to her of course. Yeah, right return my ass

[00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:36.260]
Yeah, I'd like to anyway Andrew faxes and says watch with the internet sound quality today

[00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:41.720]
I'm not complaining because you guys sound fantastic. All right. How do you like that? This is the second commentary

[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:45.560]
I also got an email from somebody saying boy, I can hear you I can hear you people just

[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:47.320]
smack out in glitz and

[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:52.340]
positive. Now much about Faggery and Brady Quinn naked. It's really clear queer and clean

[00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:56.800]
Usually it sounds like you're talking through a toilet paper tube a toilet paper. She I am

[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:02.100]
Also, you should do a poll of what station was your best for me WIOD and WQM are very close

[00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:07.000]
Thanks Neil Susandra and of course the obvious answer is eight or four, but that's beside the point. That was the best show

[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:09.640]
You don't think so?

[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.120]
I wasn't listening then I heard like two episodes of that show

[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:19.080]
So oh, well, and of course then you hated the bird like poison then you turned on them. So they you know, you can't be right right keep

[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:22.120]
Spinning I would say this is the best show. I was too much of a

[00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:28.560]
Like I kind of we read the story about the other a pucy in those days. Yeah, I just took too much crap

[00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:30.640]
Put up with too much garbage

[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:35.300]
I do know this it was a very different show because that was more of a morning zoo kind of thing

[00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:36.200]
It was a morning zoo show

[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:41.080]
We had captain Dave in the bird and yours true all kinds of people and it was all over the place and there was music and everything

[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:45.020]
It was like that when I just played. You know, it's the great quality of those now

[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:49.540]
Little on the muddy side we apologize for that and then there's always

[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:53.180]
Right, we got that too

[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:58.780]
And anyway, this show used to be quite something else back in the day when we could really say something before they brought that bitch

[00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:00.220]
Joyce in there and you know

[00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:04.020]
So so to try to compare it's just it's pointless

[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:08.880]
Is net start comparing the moxiballs with the cum quads that you just can't do it right

[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:13.560]
It's a different situation. We can't do things we used to

[00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:17.000]
924 votes over gonna have a close to a thousand by the top of this hour

[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:21.080]
That is a real show of power yesterday if you didn't listen yesterday boy

[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:24.760]
It was a record-breaking moment this day on our pool which that doesn't mean anything

[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:29.800]
We'd much rather have you read the bedtime stories you might learn something wouldn't we Josh? Oh, yeah

[00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:33.480]
They're off to a good start today and that's because somebody got the stories up there

[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:39.900]
In fact, we already got 275 reads on the most red story and all of yesterday we had 286 on the a chaney story

[00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:40.600]
That's bad

[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:48.300]
Monday and Tuesday this week off to a really weak start on the bedtime stories that makes us wonder what the hell is going on out there, you know

[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:51.720]
Remember that scene in network?

[00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:55.700]
What the f is going on? How would be alert like whizzing in on the, yeah

[00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:57.940]
And anyway

[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.340]
928 votes on the pool. Let's get that to a thousand months

[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:03.420]
We had over 1600 votes during the show yesterday

[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:08.800]
I believe the first time in the modern era maybe since alien days. I don't remember that far back. Do you?

[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:14.460]
No, I might go to the history page on air which Eric is very apologetic about but I appreciate it very much

[00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:19.300]
Eric because if I'm really stuck for a poll like for today for example like this piece of crap

[00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:24.120]
I mean this great poll we got on today. I just go back and way way back and say oh yeah, we haven't done that in about four years

[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:30.940]
And this audience they got like a they they're memory from one minute to the next they can't remember you know and I don't blame them

[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:36.960]
Speaking of the radio business and how it used to be and this was this and I you know you can't live in the past baby

[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:41.000]
Like the dolphins in the maple leaves and all these other sports team. You can't live in the past

[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:42.920]
What are you doing for us now?

[00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:47.220]
And I would suggest the same for the Patriots too by the way can't live in the past

[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:49.520]
But that was a real stinko on Sunday. That was bad

[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.980]
And then then to have to hear that jackass that they kept on yeah

[00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:57.420]
I know was only about a two-minute phone call seemed like about two hours that the Joey G or whatever's name was

[00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:02.040]
You heard that I'm sure at the end of the show. Yeah that that setup call that fake call there

[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:05.600]
I was at a fake call sounded like it to me, but what do I know?

[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:08.060]
Now my see there you go again. What?

[00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:12.060]
You are such a backstabber I can't believe it. What do you do backstabber back?

[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:15.740]
Pat you're a good buddy Kenny that you were talking about what a good guy

[00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:19.980]
He is not much you like him and you're giving counseling and how they're going to destroy his show and ruin his life

[00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:20.220]
Right

[00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:25.860]
And the guarantee that I said all these roadblocks in a way to make sure that he fails which he will but nevertheless

[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:31.400]
And now you're ripping him like suggesting it was a setup call. It's what it sounded like to me

[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:35.580]
Well, it was just went on forever. He just kept saying the same thing over and over again

[00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:37.720]
Although I'm glad that they found it was extremely funny

[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:44.440]
The auction for clear channel communications the largest US radio station chain was down to the wire last night

[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:50.400]

[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:54.080]
As one private equity group pulled out the race shortly before they could pull out of the race

[00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:56.740]
Surely before the companies board meant to decide its fate

[00:37:56.740 --> 00:38:01.160]
There's nothing worse but and pull it out just before the decisions made before the momentous moment

[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:02.560]
They pulled out

[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:08.920]

[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:23.940]

Since it was founded in the 1970s by Lowry maze the anxious chairman

[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:18.240]
Third channel is emerged as one of the most powerful forces and one of the most evil forces in US media industry history

[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:20.320]
Evil evil being the operative word evil

[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:25.380]
Destroyers of radio stations. They used to be great. Destroyers of careers lives

It's like hurting cats, you know a lot said like hurting cats. I didn't know they heard it cats. Did you?

[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:40.420]
Well, if you step on them it hurts them in 2002 law was you put them in a microwave on high cook for about five minutes

[00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:45.260]
In 2002, a lot was forced to resign from his minority leader position after remarks he made it

[00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:47.880]
The late senator strom thermon's hundredth birthday party

[00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:51.380]
I want to say this about my state when strom thermon ran for president

[00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:53.960]
We voted for him lots in December 2002 and we're proud of it

[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:57.800]
And if the rest of the country had followed our lead we wouldn't have had all these problems all over the years

[00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:58.860]
They either lot said

[00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:01.080]
Meaning course with the dark folks

[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:02.720]
racist pig

[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:09.780]
Thermon ran for president as a dixie cratin 40 there's a strong supporter of racial segregation a real Yahoo red neck

[00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:16.220]
Strom thermon I want to tell you ladies and gentlemen that there's not enough troops in the army to force the southern people to break down segregation and admit the

[00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:19.500]
Negra race into our theaters into our swimming pools into our homes into our churches

[00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:23.420]
Thurman said in one speech in 1948 the Negra race in IGRA

[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:28.020]
With several teeth missing of course

[00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:32.020]
What's your creb all these crackers man like they're fooling somebody

[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:36.340]
And like something really has changed in the south absolutely not

[00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:38.160]
absolutely not

[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:43.780]
Probably they just had the lynchings after dark now you know when nobody can see him

[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:48.800]
A woman who claims she was kicked off an airplane because she was breastfeeding her baby

[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:51.560]
Well, there's sure a lot of hanky spanky going on the planes remember the story

[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:53.200]
I yesterday about that couple that wouldn't stop

[00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:57.460]
We do whatever they were doing on the plane right except breastfeeding is uh, you know

[00:45:57.460 --> 00:46:02.360]
Is wholesome and nobody has the right to interfere with the problem as her son was 22 that she was always a

[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:06.400]
joke is just a very bad you know what she looked like

[00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:08.540]
I don't know if she's 27

[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.600]
She looks like Scarlett Johansson

[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:15.440]
I will say this I want to clarify I don't want to get carried away because some of the pictures

[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:17.500]
You don't really look all that good faithfully Brady Quinn

[00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:21.100]
I don't really know what he looks like because I never see him up close and personal so I'll

[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:26.480]
I'll revise the comments. I made before the last break and I will say I would sniff his jock strap

[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:28.860]
But only in halftime not after the whole whole game was played

[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:31.700]
Okay, you know what I'm saying?

[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:38.460]
In other words at halftime. I mean how sweaty obviously you know what I'm saying by the end of the game pretty sweaty pretty gamey by the all four quarters

[00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:43.320]
In fact, I pay him four quarters just for a little especially because it's a good gamey a woman who claims

[00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:47.120]
She was kicked off an airplane because she was breastfeeding her baby is filed a complaint against two airlines

[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:48.100]
Her attorney said

[00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:49.340]
Emily Gillette

[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:53.060]
I wonder if she looks sharp and feel sharp and I wonder if she shaves would you let

[00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:55.460]
Emily Gillette 27 of Santa Fe, New Mexico

[00:46:55.880 --> 00:47:01.540]
filed the complaint with the Vermont Human Rights Commission late last week against Delta Airlines and Freedom Airlines said of attorney Elizabeth

[00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:02.620]
Bopal

[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:07.920]
Freedom was operating the Delta flight between Burlington and New York City freedom airlines

[00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:14.540]
Sounds like a puddle jumper to me and I'm sure it is Gillette said she was discreetly breastfeeding her 22 month old daughter October 13

[00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:15.980]
discreetly you know

[00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:21.000]
As their flight prepared to leave Burlington International Airport she said she was seated by the window in the next last row

[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.140]
Her husband was seated between her and the aisle and no part of her breast was showing

[00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:30.900]
A flight attendant tried to hand her a blanket in order to cover up to let said she declined telling the flight attendant

[00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:33.940]
She had to leave her right to breastfeed her baby on other one. He's militant bitches

[00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:35.120]
militant

[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:41.880]
Does have the legal right no sense of decency just whip an ad booby right out she was standing in the aisle with both of them out

[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:46.120]
Feed like squirting the milk into the baby's mouth from a distance. She has the legal right to do that

[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:51.080]
Moments later a Delta ticket agent approached and sent the flight attendant and asked that the family be removed from the flight

[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:53.840]
Gillette said she said she didn't want to make a scene and complied

[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:59.840]
It embarrassed me that was my first reaction, which is a weird reaction for doing something so good for a child Gillette said

[00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:03.960]
A freedom spokesman said Gillette was asked to leave the flight after she declined the blanket

[00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:10.140]
A breastfeeding mother is perfectly acceptable on an aircraft for riding. She's feeding the child in a discrete way

[00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:14.860]
That doesn't bother others had Paul Skellen spokesman spokesman for the feeding spakes to freedom airline

[00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:17.640]
She was asked to use a blanket just to provide a little more discretion

[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:21.140]
She was given a blanket and she we've used to use it. That's all I know he be saying

[00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:24.640]
A complaint against two airlines was filed with the Vermont Human Rights Commission

[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:29.220]
All the executive director Robert Apple said he was barbed by state law from confirming the complaint

[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:32.020]
He sent state law allows a mother to breastfeed in public

[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:33.160]
public

[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:37.820]
The Vermont Human Rights Commission investigates complaints and determines whether discrimination may have occurred

[00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:40.460]
The parties to a complaint are given six months to reach a settlement

[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:45.060]
If none has reached the commission then decides whether to go to court a complaint can file a separate suit and stay court

[00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:47.060]
Just say you know much you do about nothing

[00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:51.860]
This is you know, this should be your worst problem. Okay, both the people at the airlines and this bitch

[00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:53.160]
should be your worst problem

[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:58.460]
Just put the booby under the blanket and be a little discreet and stop stopping a flash around an airplane

[00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:05.780]
You silly ass bitch or how about everybody else mine their own business. Yeah, that's right everybody else looks straight forward straight ahead

[00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:10.300]
Well, she was talking to me. I think the boob has never hurt any of you. Maybe she was hot and she had like extraordinary

[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:15.500]
Supple boobies doesn't matter. Oh, there's Hank is on a CNN

[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:19.500]
Want to get directly over to her. She's all done. I hear

[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:26.660]
956 votes that's Barbara star and of course George keeps making these grotesque comments just because Hank weighs 800 pounds now

[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:32.760]
Did you talk to him? Do you have a heart to hearted with him? I'm just like the one you had with Kenny Walker about how they're trying to destroy the

[00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:37.900]
Morning show by putting all these segments in there with Iroh a windbag and whatever what I threw Rosenstein houses

[00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:41.240]
Burge or whatever I got my own problems stand Burge steam

[00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:47.560]
Robert Whitestone rights. I like this. This is my kind of calm. Just like the one I had yesterday. That was a good column

[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:50.220]
About the religious about the gaskies

[00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:56.140]
Robert Whitestone lives in Middleton, Wisconsin as the essays regularly appear in the capital times

[00:49:56.140 --> 00:50:00.940]
Madison, Wisconsin and he's been published in free thought today and the yadiotic is in the smirking chimp

[00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:04.020]
because the bible tells me so is the

[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:06.300]
Title on that article

[00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:11.000]
I'm an American atheist he writes. I believe in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights

[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.140]
I did not believe in gods are in revealed texts

[00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:18.080]
My belief in the tools of democracy is relevant on the public square. My disbelief in gods is not

[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:25.800]
On November 7th the Family Research Institute of Wisconsin whose mission is to forward Judeo-Christian principles and traditional values in Wisconsin

[00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:31.640]
want a victory for their organizations and treportation of the bible with the passing of the amendment to ban gay marriages and civil unions

[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:37.360]
According to a September 23rd Milwaukee journal sent an article by Bill Glauber

[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:42.280]
The FRI claimed that the amendment had the support of 5,000 churches and two million congregants

[00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:47.880]
While fair was constant the group leading the fight against the amendment claimed that the resolutions opposing the amendments have been passed by

[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:50.420]
Organizations representing a half a million congregants

[00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:53.840]
On October 19th a former's held a Madison to debate the states

[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:59.560]
November 7th advisory referendum on establishing the death penalty for first-degree murder cases back by DNA evidence

[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:05.240]
The Reverend Mike Mayhack of faith Baptist Church quoted Genesis and Romans in support of the death penalty

[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:11.060]
Bishop Roberto Morlino of the diocese of Madison relied on the Pope's interpretation of the bible to oppose the death penalty

[00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:15.600]
While acknowledging that there were people of different faiths on either side of these issues

[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:18.000]
I can only assume there was a preponderance of Christians

[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:22.060]
So to them I ask are you guys reading the same bible and if you are

[00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:26.820]
Where's the ultimate authority of such diametrically opposed opinions can be butthrist by the same text

[00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:31.740]
This is not a rational debate. It's a Bible quoting arms race each side

[00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:37.880]
Cherry picking its way through a religious document that was arbitrarily cobbled together over several centuries from many different writers and diverse

[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:41.900]
Cultural menus whoever ends up with the most fruit expects to win the day

[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:45.740]
The trouble is many of the cherries in the Bible are just plain rotten

[00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:49.980]
In the early 19th century abolitionist held a high moral ground by any objective

[00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:54.660]
Rational nonbiblical backward glance however southern slave owners and the representatives in Congress

[00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:56.720]
one of the theological argument hands down

[00:51:57.300 --> 00:52:02.940]
As Reverend Richard Fuller said in 1845 what God sanctioned in the Old Testament and permitted the new cannot be a sin

[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:08.140]
Slavery as we now know was a sin in a national disgrace even if the Bible didn't tell us so

[00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:12.080]
But if we learned anything in the intervening 160 years about scripture and policy

[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:16.840]
From our house majority leader Dick army one said the Bible is very clear on homosexuality

[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:19.220]
I abide by the instructions that have given me in the Bible

[00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:26.160]
One can only speculate if armies understanding a scripture was informed by the Reverend Ted Hagrid's weekly televised pulpit pontifications

[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:32.020]
Well, it'll take our country another 160 years to know that discriminating against the group of people because of their sexual orientation

[00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:35.660]
Is a sin and a national disgrace regardless of what the Bible tells us

[00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:40.760]
My point is that the Bible or any religious text has no authority on the public square in a secular society

[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:46.280]
Who's guiding authority rests in the Constitution and Bill of Rights our democracy is based on a rational defense of the civil rights

[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:48.080]
Civil liberties and economic welfare of its citizens

[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:50.300]
Not on the ambiguous and often cognitive three

[00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:54.300]
Approbations and proscriptions of religious text democracy cannot serve two masters

[00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:59.260]
This is not to say that an individual's political stance cannot be informed by his or her religious belief

[00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:01.960]
It will be absurd to claim otherwise, but as a political argument

[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:09.520]
Religious beliefs should go no further than the church door or your own pocket on the public square because the Bible tells me so just doesn't cut it or it shouldn't

[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:14.320]
On a recent book signing to in Milwaukee Jim Wallace author of God politics

[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:18.480]
Why the right gets it wrong and the left doesn't get it net would local courage you advocate for the poor

[00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:21.940]
Wallace maintained that his goal of eliminating poverty is based on some

[00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:25.040]
2000 Bible versus stressing the importance of ministering to the poor

[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:30.580]
But should anyone need to consult the Bible to be assured of a moral or ethical imperative to help those who are mirrored in poverty

[00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:34.860]
Is there enough evidence available to anyone whose gaze is unblinkered by ideology or religious belief?

[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:40.840]
Keep in mind Jesus did say that the poor would always be among us wasn't he telling us to chill on the poverty thing

[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:48.220]
Who's telling us just to take a pill and take a chill and then we say oh Jesus a chill pill when I was Birken's the Birken stock

[00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:54.380]
963 votes this hour will go over a thousand on the poll and then we can like take a nice nap a dirt nap

[00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:58.860]
Some kind of a nice long nap wouldn't it be good? Okay, Josh by the way now

[00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:03.740]
I did watch American dad last night, which I thought was a cute was good. I

[00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:04.940]
voted I give it a nine

[00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:10.880]
It's good show, but that one was particularly good. Yeah, it was a gay that one of course

[00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:14.920]
That's why George sent it to me because he's you know sucking up and fake that was good

[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:19.760]
But anyway, and Josh did not watch match point. No, but he doesn't know how it ends now

[00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:27.340]
He doesn't know how it ends. No not all of it. No. Oh, well, that's not important. Okay. That part of it is not I mean, you know

[00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:31.440]
If you couldn't figure that out along the way, I must be pretty slow

[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:37.220]
And he should know because we discussed it off the air but Brian Cox that we have discussed on the air Josh and I is

[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:39.280]
Is in there our favorite character actors

[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:40.600]
one of

[00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:48.160]
And Brian Cox wasn't he in the Magnolia? He might have been he's in everything wasn't he the cop? I don't know

[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:54.060]
Out to check or did he once played for the dolphins Brian Cox. Oh, yeah that one

[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:59.000]
Yeah, that one of course somewhere here. I don't think there's any of it that I can play

[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:08.800]
It's all bleeped is it bleep sure Brian are you happy? I hate WLD again. Yeah, that's all I'm playing that I don't I don't I remember very well

[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:13.120]
I don't like the bleep in there was one of your one of your early bleeps where you know the vowels are in there

[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:16.480]
But the bleep is a precision precision my ass. Yeah, but

[00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:21.980]
68 votes on our poll today about which really over religion is the most malignant of course they're all malignant

[00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:25.740]
It's just a matter of degree. How about the Quakers they aren't really two malignant are they?

[00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:28.640]
Although keeping my Nixon was a Quaker in the

[00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:55.280]
60s

[00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:57.000]
Yeah

[00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:07.840]
It's not too late

[00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:16.360]
You can back out of this cruise wedding

[00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:23.280]
You're not too old to start again

[00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:29.420]
Hey little Katie Scientologist

[00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:35.900]
Hey little Katie your parents are pissed

[00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:47.000]
Hey little Katie it's not too late to run don't be afraid of Maverick from top of hey little Katie

[00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:50.460]
It's not too late to

You can back out of this

[00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:58.400]
cruise wedding

[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:17.180]
19 boy 41 minutes away from noon when the face of gambling is gonna change you can go online and there's a like a virtual tour video

[00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:21.120]
Of Gulfstream Park in the new the whole plant the track in a casino

[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:23.060]
Don't tell me that's all they're gonna show the casino

[00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:27.860]
They had double diamond lucky strike whatever the hell a lucky strike means fine tobacco LSMFT

[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:29.560]
Yeah, call for Philip Morris

[00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:35.620]
And I'd walk a mile for a camel. Let's play some cigarette spots just to piss off the government. Oh better not

[00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:40.820]
Oh looks so pretty nice. Okay, whatever the hell I just saw on air wasn't very a detailed and I didn't see no

[00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:41.860]
I didn't see no wheel of fortune

[00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:47.520]
If you don't have any wheel of fortune you can count me out remember that song count me in by Gary Lewis and the playboys and please don't play it

[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:50.760]
Okay, but that on Liberty Records, but nevertheless count me out

[00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:53.020]
Yeah, I remember

[00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:59.020]
You know you get hooked on whatever game. I'm sure that because I see the same faces all the time playing squeal of fortune, you know

[00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:03.880]
And I'm sure that there are people play like the lucky sevens and double diamond

[00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:10.640]
Hey, why are all this other stuff, you know and the interesting thing about slots which probably most people don't think about and I'm sure

[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:15.880]
Either neither one of you ever have thought because you're not like suckers like I am and that is that all the

[00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:18.380]
numbers and

[00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:21.020]
Symbols that they have on the wheel they might as well be blank

[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:23.480]
You know what I mean

[00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:32.580]
That's a very good point right the computer is spitting out a guitar on my each spin right and it does make a difference if they're actually our symbols on the

[00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:36.480]
The show you what you're getting or if they were just blank and it showed you hey this time you got 200 bucks

[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:39.320]
You know that's a good point. It's just an illusion a point of reference or something

[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:42.860]
It's an illusion very good. It's an illusion like an illusion of when oh here

[00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:46.300]
We got another a little warning for you as another public service of your close friends at QA

[00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:50.680]
I'm gonna want to get your ass in a ringer and this you know there's one thing I will say though before I read this

[00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:54.740]
If there's one thing I cannot stand it's a cheap drunk

[00:58:55.320 --> 00:59:01.320]
It's a loud obnoxious drunk. There's a guy. I don't want to go in and we would have been a lot of money for drinking and they're drunk

[00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:04.140]
Cannot stand a

[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:07.740]
No, I won't say cheap sloppy drunk

[00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:10.800]
Loud sloppy obnoxious

[00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:13.660]
Anyway getting back to this

[00:59:13.660 --> 00:59:16.920]
The why saturation like Josh for example. He's probably a sloppy drunk

[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:23.840]
Are you? I can be now he's all right. I'm fine. No, I know. I mean he's all right. How do you know you got drinking with him?

[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:26.240]
Uh, I think I might have

[00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:30.860]
The Broward Sheriff's Office DUI task force will come up if you've gone anywhere with him

[00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:34.720]
You've gone out drinking with him because he's got you know, he's got like a bottle in his pocket in his sock

[00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:36.960]
It's got a flask taped to his inner thigh

[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:38.320]
His ass

[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:48.280]
The BSO DUI task force will be conducting saturation patrols this Saturday, November 18 from approximately 8 30 in the PM till five in the morning on

[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:53.500]
Let's see areas of north lauderdale open park and unincorporated central Broward County

[00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:57.800]
Imperial drivers will be identified and DUI laws will be actively enforced

[00:59:58.420 --> 01:00:03.200]
This information published in compliance with a Supreme Court ruling mandating prayer announcement is selective enforcement activities

[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:06.720]
That's this Saturday night from 8 30 and then till five in the a.m. Sunday morning

[01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:11.140]
North Lauderdale open park unincorporated central Broward

[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.740]
Imperial drivers will be identified in DUI law they'll come and take your ass away and the rest of you too

[01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:21.300]
That's right. They've been doing it like every week. We're almost to a thousand now by the bottom of the air

[01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:25.620]
We'll have a thousand and then everybody will say now it can be easy to get off our back

[01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:30.840]
Environmental advocates sued the Bush administration yesterday for ignoring a 2004

[01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:35.660]
Congressional deadline to report to lawmakers in the public. I'm the latest research on global warming

[01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:37.720]
You go everybody sue their ass

[01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:42.520]
Especially the families of all these dead people that are dying over there for no reason based on a pack of lies

[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:43.720]
It's just it

[01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:52.480]
There's no point getting excited about it. I can't even speak don't even well. What's the point there is it? It's so obvious, you know

[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:58.960]
A 1990 federal law requires the government to produce a scientific report to be four years on climate change

[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:03.980]
And it's effects on the environment including land water air plant an animal life and human health

[01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:09.360]
The Clinton administration issued the first report on October 2000 warning a severe effects on different regions

[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:13.780]
But the Bush administration hasn't filed any report and is indicated it won't do so

[01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:17.660]
Environmentalists said the suit filed in federal court and San Francisco. It's like all the other laws

[01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:21.180]
You know, they just uh Bush makes it up as he goes along. Oh, that doesn't apply to us

[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:22.120]
right

[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:30.640]
Instead the administration's climate change science program says it'll issue 21 many reports on various aspects of the overall topic

[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:34.460]
The first report on temperature trends in the low-ratmosphere was released in May

[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:38.820]
Others will be issued periodically through 2008 a spokesman said. Oh speaking of spokesman

[01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:43.440]
I think the uh, I think I thought putty cat is gonna get fired in Ottawa there Brian Murray wouldn't that be bad

[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:46.960]
Let's get some of the no Bm buttons going again for the senator fans both of them

[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:48.960]
The spokesman

[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:51.900]
At least he's consistent wherever he goes. He's a loser

[01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:57.220]
The Bush administration is failed to comply with the law said attorney Julie Teal of the Center for biological diversity

[01:01:57.220 --> 01:02:03.560]
Which is a plaintiff in the lawsuit? I think the administration's afraid to release this information because it makes climate change real for people

[01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:05.740]
I thought I thought putty cat

[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:10.100]
She said the may report on low-ratmosphere temperatures is a technical document

[01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:15.520]
That will be hard for the average citizen to remember Congress to understand a 14 paid summer the report on the agency's website

[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:20.220]
Climate science.gov contains findings about temperature variations at different atmospheric levels

[01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:24.340]
But doesn't discuss how those variations affect the environment. In other words, they don't really say a damn thing

[01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:26.720]
The suit asked us district judge

[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:31.920]
Sandra Brown Armstrong has said a new deadline for a comprehensive government report on global warming research

[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:39.360]
I wonder Sandra Brown Armstrong is kin to George the chief Armstrong of those great 60 leaf teams the captain number 10

[01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:47.560]
And anyway, so there you go once again, you know, they just uh, it's all about big business and tax cuts for big business and all this other crap

[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:49.660]
And then they don't worry about it because they're gonna be dead anyway

[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:56.260]
990 three votes on the pool any second now. We're gonna go to that thousand mark and then you'll hear like a big

[01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:01.280]
Like that just like when a slot machine pays you off at the Gulf Stream this afternoon

[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:06.660]
You guys were only 35 minutes away from changing the face of gambling in South Florida in the state of Florida

[01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:08.820]
It's gonna bring them off. Yeah

[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:18.320]
All those hysterical editorials man in the newspapers like everybody's gonna lose their lunch money

[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:24.620]
And everybody's gonna go broke and the old fart's are gonna gamble away their social security my wall. You out too bad only the ones that deserve to

[01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:29.400]
That's correct only the ones stupid enough to do it take whatever money you can afford to lose and assume you're gonna lose it

[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:37.060]
Do never ever go play the song assuming you're gonna win assume you're gonna lose whatever you got in your pocket and whatever credit cards you bring although they're not letting you have ATMs

[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:39.920]
Uh, how is that possible?

[01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:44.940]
I mean, I'm sure they'll find a way to get any money out for they'll find a way

[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:49.860]
Way to what oh, that's right you go out to the park night you get in your car and you go go down the street and you find

[01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:55.100]
You know the public's a whatever with an ATM and they come flying paddy running running back in say did you save my machine?

[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:58.820]
Mind did you save my good machine? He said no, I just won three grand on faster

[01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:05.180]
He's a very handsome young man who can't see that hey Jim here's the budget report

[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:10.860]
What I like you the oh I can be Jim what's wrong with you Jim

[01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:19.760]
Suffers from Borat's disease. It strikes those who have seen the Borat movie and results in the uncontrollable urge to speak like Borat Jim

[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:25.840]
Knock it off. We have a meeting with Elaine. She's from the dude. No, she's the regional manager

[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:30.280]
No one is immune Borat's disease can strike anyone at any time

[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:39.460]
Unfortunately, there is no cure for Borat's disease, but thankfully symptoms will dissipate over time

[01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:41.640]
Exit time stop it

[01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:48.060]
Please keep generously to the Borat's disease foundation together. We can find a cure

[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:50.760]
Sorry

[01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:55.160]
I'm a thirty one me too a little bit of Kakostan

[01:04:56.060 --> 01:05:00.320]
But there you go talking about Sam Major again just like the other day thousand twelve oats on the pole

[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:06.200]
You enchefe cook up a coffee and and demanded that world leaders give climate change the same priority

[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:10.460]
As they did the wars and decirbing the spread of weapons of mass destruction he demanded

[01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:16.820]
I then made the appeal as he launched a three day get talk about a paper tiger man unbelievable

[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:23.000]
And it made the appeal as he launched a three day gathering of environmental chiefs tasked with stepping up action against

[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.560]
Global warming in his valedict

[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:25.320]
unbelievable

[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:31.440]
And it made the appeal as he launched a three day gathering of environmental chiefs tasked with stepping up action against

[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:36.900]
In his valedictory speech to the annual you know, I'm thinking an algorithm. I think the dark horse in 2008

[01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:42.480]
Okay, you don't think well he won once already he could do it again. That's right

[01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:44.640]
In his overall soda junk

[01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:49.940]
Climate change in peril's agriculture through drought and coastal cities through rising sea levels

[01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:56.620]
poses a health threat by spreading mosquito-borne disease and could lead to billion dollar weather calamities said on an cup of coffee

[01:05:56.620 --> 01:06:01.300]
Climate change is also a threat to peace and security. He warned changing better

[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:06.120]
Patterns of rainfall for example tonight in competition for resources setting in motion potentially

[01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:12.840]
These these stats destabilizing tensions and migration especially in fragile states or volatile regions

[01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:17.780]
The reason I hesitated destabilizing a spell with an S like British. What is

[01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:24.440]
Ministers of their standards at the 180 United Nations meeting of the wind framework convention our climate change

[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:26.240]
UN FCC see

[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:32.020]
What our under pressure to spell out by Friday their commitments for deepening cuts and greenhouse gas emissions

[01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:34.060]
That's what Joyce wants us to do on the show

[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:36.400]
Is that part of the deal that we got to do?

[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:37.480]
Yes

[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:41.140]
Is cut down on greenhouse and other gas emissions

[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:50.180]
The spotlight is being placed on Brazil China and India big population developing countries whose carbon pollution has surged in line with their economic growth

[01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:54.160]
The European Union hopes these countries will signal they will join rich nations and making

[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:59.280]
binding curbs in their emissions when negotiations start next year to reshape the UN FCC's

[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:02.340]
CCT Kyoto a protocol after it aspires in

[01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:06.140]
2012 the US meanwhile which walked away from Kyoto in 2001

[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:11.740]
Is being scrutinized again with an S for any gesture toward the pact in light of the last week's US elections

[01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:15.700]
It was the Democrats arrested controller congress away from Bush's neocons

[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:20.860]
From the fascists the US by itself accounts for a quarter of the world's greenhouse gas output

[01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:28.260]
Oh boy, not a gas although if position is number one polluter could soon be overtaken by China a major burner of coil that I say China

[01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:33.440]
Greenhouse gases trap the sun's heat instead of letting it radiate out into space

[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:37.920]
That's not fuck if you keep the gas inside your body and don't let it out

[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:43.740]
If you trap it inside man, you're gonna explode one of these days. That's why you got to like let it out

[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:50.560]
As a result earth atmospheric temperature is rising in lay scientists are convinced this is already starting to affect the climate

[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:51.940]
And speaking of that

[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:56.340]
What a segue. Oh there's that anxious John Warner from Virginia

[01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.600]
nice hair John big

[01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:03.300]
Late-haired goofball old turd a

[01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:04.240]
Small centimeter

[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:11.160]
16 in tsunami hit northern Japan after an 8.1 magnitude earthquake shook the Russian-owned Coral Islands on more Wednesday today

[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:17.420]
Acquited Japan's meteorological agency see how this ties right in there. Mm-hmm. It's a small tsunami mommy

[01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:24.160]
Residents along Japan's Pacific coast were told to flee these tsunami after the quake the warning was issued for eastern

[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:29.760]
Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost island and the west national uh, NOAA said remember know-out with or without the arc

[01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:35.480]
Old drunk. No, it was an old drunk. Yes, he was and I'm sure glad that he got those dinosaurs fitted out of the arc

[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:39.560]
Huh, no, maybe maybe they couldn't fit on the earth. That's why we don't have no more dinosaur

[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:44.080]
We got Barney, but that's all we got left

[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:50.580]
An earthquake of this size has the potential to generate a destructive tsunami that can strike coastlines in the region near the

[01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:56.560]
Emphacenter within minutes to hours the NOAA said the national oceanic and atmospheric administration NOAA

[01:08:57.540 --> 01:09:00.360]
Another bubble icy another silly fairy tale

[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:07.880]
Japan's primary broadcasting source NHK said Japanese officials had expected waves of up to six and a half feet in the

[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:12.180]
Less populated area of the island chain while the coast of Japan may get a wave of up to one meter

[01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:14.320]
Three three three feet plus

[01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:16.420]
About 30,000 people

[01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:21.900]
Living in the cruel islands, which is about 1100 kilometers or 660 miles north of mainland Japan

[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:27.520]
And it's got a bunch of Japanese names on it. Do you think I'm going to read him? No, come on. Give it a shot

[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:31.900]
No chance tsunami waves generated by earthquakes are often barely noticeable in the ocean

[01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:35.340]
And then all of a sudden before we know it just like that horrible one we had the oh boy

[01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:37.720]
But you know what I'm gonna note tsunami mommy

[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:40.460]
Bad news. That's when God gets really pissed off

[01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:44.800]
You know of course a lot of innocent people die because God's got bad in he's always got bad in

[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:52.120]
So it's not a good idea to mess with Lord because when he gets pissed off look out man my my my look out now

[01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:57.080]
Because God only knows who's gonna be in the yeah in the way

1024 votes on a poll today

[01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:06.780]
It's another one of our extraordinarily scientific and anti-religion polls. I think we ought to take an anti-religion poll every day

[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:14.200]
Like I got a good one. What do you think of a religious fanatic? And then the end the only answer to the poll would be

[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:15.520]

You know who loves to eat and deli's I told you this once before and didn't believe me. That's true though

[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:40.180]
And and that's because you don't have it's not a similar kind of thing in South Florida

[01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:44.560]

The most evil doers on the face of the planet much more than the Muslims who have about 294 only 26% say not even close

[01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:26.620]
Those islamo fascist as the much moisture calls them

Entireless people and by the way Paul you might you might want to know it

[01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:06.540]
I'm sure that some of the other people in town are aware of it that it was Neil Rogers on the year

[01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:12.080]
Ranting and raving and encouraging people to go out and vote for this in Broward which got helped to get this thing passed in the first place

[01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:17.340]

How we wish you know all these years never got offered any graft

[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:39.640]

Oh yeah, you're under here roll you're under take right yeah take it is cutting you in take a big fat one

[01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:59.940]
US Airways launches take over bid for Delta. Oh my goodness

[01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:05.040]
US Airways group said today. It's made an eight billion dollar cash in stock with for Delta airlines

[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:07.740]
A deal that they wouldn't create one of the world's largest carriers

[01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:12.000]
The move came despite Delta's repeated statements. It's not interest in the merger. We don't want

[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:12.900]
We don't want

[01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:18.400]
The offer to buy Delta once the Atlanta based airline emerges from bankruptcy protection by the middle of next year

[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:24.480]
Would give Delta's unsecured creditors for billion dollars in cash and 78 and a half million shares of US Airways stock

[01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:29.440]
As it stands now Delta's common shares are like for them a worthless one in X its bankruptcy

[01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:33.680]
In most bankruptcy cases that that holder is usually in up with new shares of the company

[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:40.600]
Doug Parker chief executive of Tempe Arizona based US skier air said in a telephone interview that he's aware of the

[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:43.120]
Comments made by Delas management in recent months

[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:47.000]
But he believes that's a fair offer and that ultimately delas creditors will see that

[01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:49.480]
That's what the got US skier air said

[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:56.860]
Delta's in bankruptcy and bankruptcy is a very open process parker said the process is designed so the creditors get the highest possible

[01:17:56.860 --> 01:18:02.160]
Value for their clients given that process what we've done is gone public with them. I'll turn it into a standalone plan

[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:08.180]
They open the doors for the first machine. Maybe the first real slot machine in Florida. It's gonna go just like that

[01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:08.860]
jackpot

[01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:16.160]
But she said Delta has consistently said that it plans to emerge from bankruptcy as an independent airline and a partnership in a fair tree

[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:20.180]
And I don't fight any of those anyway under a penalty of death. I just don't yeah

[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:26.300]
You don't fly because you can't afford to fly plus where we go anyway away

[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:34.280]
Yeah, that's a good idea like Vancouver sounds good sure it does sounds great somewhere in BC up there working like you know

[01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:39.760]
Get out in the nature and walk a big fat one in a newspaper should have my morning newspaper

[01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:46.160]
Mori dads got a calm today. I'm sure it's got a lot of words in I can't pronounce because the headlines is pouring shardin A diplomacy

[01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:50.620]
I mean shardin A I can and maybe a little bit of cheese too, you know

[01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:53.900]
You can't have a wine tasting without cheese just as Henry oh

[01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:54.520]
Viral

[01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:59.360]
Mori dads says the foreign affairs fur is flying

[01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:02.640]
I'm not talking about the cat fight between two strong willed

[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:08.400]
Expensively dressed democratic politicians married to California gazillionaires would speak a reluctancy Pelosi tried to yank Jane

[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:13.640]
Harmon from heading the House Intelligence Committee. I'm talking about the cat fight between the idealists and the realists

[01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:20.040]
After an election that spurned ideology in the traffic return of the Bush 41 pragmatist James Baker and Robert Gates

[01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:23.760]
The self-proclaimed idealists are reduced to hissing from the sidelines

[01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:25.060]
They're hissing

[01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:33.460]
The Vulcan's and Neocons had grandiose plans to restore trumpets morality and spine to foreign policy to establish America's a hyper power

[01:19:33.460 --> 01:19:36.800]
Where they do need to export democracy by forcing on its own if necessary

[01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:42.820]
But now the grandiose experiment of Iraq is in a sulfurious shambles. See I told you

[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:50.480]
The grandiose experiment of Iraq is in a sulfurous shambles and the real policy crowd is back cleaning up

[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:55.640]
In the Wall Street Journal Michael Rubin of the American Enterprise Institute railed against the evils of

[01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:56.720]
Shardonnay diplomacy

[01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:02.460]
Recalling that in 1983 Donald Rumsfeld President Reagan's middle east envoy met with Sodom Hussein and Baghdad

[01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:05.660]
Hoping to restore relations out of a concern over growing Iranian influence

[01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:08.260]
He didn't bother to mention Sodom's use of chemical weapons

[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:12.560]
Mr. Gates was the CIA's deputy director for intelligence at the time of mr

[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:16.200]
Rumsfeld infamous handshake deputy director of central intelligence when Sodom

[01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:21.140]
Gashed the Kurds and deputy national security adviser when Sodom crushed the shiaid uprising mr

[01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:22.460]
Rubin wrote mr

[01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:23.540]
Baker was as central

[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:28.800]
Rami he said worked to right past wrongs by contrast and Eocons fear mr

[01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:32.620]
Gates and mr. Baker are back winking at dictators already they're talking about

[01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:37.080]
Causing up to the evil leaders of Iran and Syria and perhaps dreaming of more concessions to the Palestinians

[01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:40.340]
Israel and its supporters among christian evangelicals are having conceptions

[01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:47.400]
The idealist to love Ronald Reagan's evocation of Thomas pain we haven't our power to begin the world over again

[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:50.020]
I write that Americans yearn for a moral foreign policy

[01:20:50.020 --> 01:20:55.580]
It was sickening in 1989 to see Brent Scorcroft another realist back in fashion offering a cozy

[01:20:55.580 --> 01:21:00.740]
Supper to the Chinese leaders only six months after tenement square and getting poppy to lecture your craniums

[01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:02.060]
Not to break the air and grip of Moscow

[01:21:02.660 --> 01:21:08.800]
It was sickening after Bush Perry so see father Bush sold a Persian Gulf war as a moral mission to see the 41 team

[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:14.260]
Decided to end not to intervene to stop satan from slaughtering thousands of innocent shiaids and curbs who rose up as the president

[01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:18.480]
asked it was sickening when the first Bush administration decided to do nothing about the

[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:22.400]
Genocide will serve me and war on Bosnia 92 as secretariat state Baker

[01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:25.120]
Frust really explained we don't have a dog in that fight

[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:30.420]
Justifying the administration's tough stance toward Israel develop and hammered another notorious comment

[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:33.920]
F the Jews he told a colleague privately they don't vote for us anyway

[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:37.520]
But while the idealists have a point they also have a problem

[01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:44.280]
They're moral war in Iraq was sold four years ago with two big lies that Saddam had WMD and that the Iraqis were yearning for democracy

[01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:47.520]
And it's continued in the fog of deception about imaginary progress

[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:53.000]
It's immoral to put troops lives at risk because one is dr. Nier to make people die for a figure of flexibility

241 servicemen were blown up and in rake of egg negotiating with Gorbachev on nuclear arms

[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:21.840]
He was incredibly flexible and effective contrast with his inflexible rhetoric

[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:27.000]
He pursued openings and even radical diplomacy if the Gipper was would the decider is stone

[01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:31.460]
Voters rejected W's black and white good and evil incompetent foreign policy last week

[01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:41.600]
Who is perfectly positioned to come up with a solution that will find Washington and flop in Baghdad

[01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:49.400]
As the theologian rindled neighbor taught morality without realism is nigh ft or worse and realism without morality as cynicism or worse

[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:55.420]
Morality should open your eyes not close them. That's what marine says with a whole bunch of words in there that I have that butchered real bad

[01:22:56.100 --> 01:23:02.360]
She was just she's great but she see this is one reason that a lot of people don't read newspaper articles are like even timer newsweek

[01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:17.840]
Desire this this endless is a to use words that most people that I can't even pronounce much less understand

[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:23.160]

Yeah, we're sending Frado to Vegas under the protection of the whatever was on the west coast

[01:23:41.140 --> 01:23:43.960]
What was that family on the west coast? Don Francisco and host

[01:23:44.540 --> 01:23:50.280]
Don Francisco. What a memory for godfather trivia manners and movie that is in play even Josh can't knock it

[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:55.280]
Nobody can why nobody can right nobody can knock the godfather

[01:23:55.900 --> 01:24:00.840]
In fact, I think how do we find those things by the way? How do I do this amazing miracle miracle?

[01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:03.440]
What is it it's a miracle

[01:24:04.020 --> 01:24:05.720]

You company man you fairy and some great moments a rare performance by all the big apartment

[01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:50.640]

[01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:06.220]
A thousand sixty four votes on the poll I know that sounds ridiculous, but it's just to try to make a point

Retirement from that fine organization to pursue another colon not a higher colon really more of a lower colon

Much much lower and even though president Bush won't return my calls anymore

[01:26:30.340 --> 01:26:35.320]
And I've been kicked out of my church. I found a new home a new home on television

[01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:39.540]
Beginning that Sunday the brother network will premiere my series

That's Queer I own the preacher guy with me

[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:22.560]
The Reverend Ted Haggard Sundays on Bravo

[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:45.880]
Ryan Cox

In fact, I think I got some of that old stuff

[01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:50.640]
Mm-hmm

[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:54.960]
Oh, yeah, I don't even want to hear about the negative stuff. Okay good

[01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:56.920]
That's as much as I'm playing him

[01:27:57.580 --> 01:28:01.340]
He was sure credit to the team in the community wasn't he both

[01:28:02.140 --> 01:28:03.460]
He was just great both

[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:07.780]
Didn't he wind up with the JETS they stuck jets? I think so yes, he did

[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:14.340]
And a match made in heaven and eventually wound up on TV just like every other uh, well everybody does

[01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:17.340]
How about that dancing with the stars maybe could be on that

[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:22.160]
First rated by local TV news outlets that run commercial disguised as news

[01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:28.000]
An FCC commissioner wants to investigate stations. I don't tell viewers they may be watching corporate propaganda instead of

[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.880]
Independently before the information and by the way, it's 1204 you know where your loose changes right now

[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:34.480]
It's probably in a machine of Gulfstream

[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:36.800]
You realize that?

[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:41.180]
Four minutes ago they let the crowd in and you can just to make can you see those old people with their walkers

[01:28:41.180 --> 01:28:45.100]
And where they're oxygen tanks just slipping. Yeah, it's a walker race

[01:28:45.100 --> 01:28:47.940]
Oh, I sure hope they got the the walkers with the wheels on

[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:52.340]
So they can do wheelies on a way to get the good machine man

[01:28:52.340 --> 01:28:54.900]
Though the area machine is full right now. I bet you're gonna

[01:28:54.900 --> 01:28:59.240]
And you know something if this was a real radio station, which of course it is not and we had a real program to reach

[01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:01.340]
Of course, we don't don't even go there girlfriend

[01:29:01.340 --> 01:29:04.900]
We would have somebody there a reporter for the opening day, man

[01:29:04.900 --> 01:29:07.920]
Sure, the people there would be ecstatic. I mean we're supposed to be good

[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:11.320]
Bunk by buddies with those people over there all the poor mutual including Gulfstream

[01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:15.640]
And you think that we can have somebody there to call it on the bat line and give us a report

[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:19.300]
Boy pay you all that money because you're funny, right? Yeah

[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:23.280]
I'm just telling you that would be the way we do on a ride state if it was a real radio station

[01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:26.460]
Which of course it's not if we had any support on the show, which we do not

[01:29:29.020 --> 01:29:33.380]
KGT KGOTB and ABC affiliate in San Francisco was one of 46 stations in 22 states

[01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:40.140]
Setted for improperly including video news releases or vnr's in a news stories according to a report released yesterday by two watchdog groups

[01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:42.920]
Center for media and democracy and free press

[01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:49.140]
Tuesday's report was a follow-up to an April study by the same organizations that found that 77 stations nationally including

[01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:54.260]
CBS 5 TV and San Francisco KPIX had improperly used vnr's

[01:29:54.860 --> 01:29:59.200]
Representatives of both stations acknowledged erroneously using them and called them isolated incidents

[01:29:59.860 --> 01:30:04.120]
A vnr is a pre-packaged segment that looks and sounds like journalistically reported information

[01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:10.000]
But is produced by either a public relations firm or a government body with the vested interest in the product or service being described

[01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:11.460]
In other words proper gander

[01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:21.720]
While media advocates say including pre-packaged material may not seem as serious when a tv news reporter is doing a fluffy feature piece on what kind of lipstick to wear like that tangy relips gloss

[01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:23.380]
So you know that what's his name like?

[01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:25.080]
Who what is it Jim?

[01:30:25.340 --> 01:30:29.280]
I can't who is it Jim Rome? No, not Jim Rome

[01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:32.840]
Mission impossible. Oh

[01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:38.120]
Peter graves Peter graves. Why do I always call him Jim because that was his name in the show Jim? Okay

[01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:41.300]
The implications could be more than that if the journalist broadcasts

[01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:46.640]
Corp. produced information without critical examination or identification when reporting on a new treatment for liver cancer

[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:56.900]
Tuesday six month investigation included a story aired by a tv station in Missouri that questioned global warming and was largely based on a vnr created by oil industry lobbyists

[01:30:56.900 --> 01:30:59.760]
The station did not identify the source of the material

[01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:06.080]
The federal communications act requires broadcasters to inform their audience that such matter is sponsored paid for or furnished

[01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:11.200]
Either in whole or in part and by whom were on whose behalf such consideration was supplied

[01:31:12.180 --> 01:31:19.040]
Fade you to identify the source of a vnr is also an ethical violation the industries video tv news directors association guidelines on vnr

[01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:28.040]
Usages news managers and producers should clarify should clearly disclose the origin of information in label all material provided by corporate or other non editorial sources and a part

[01:31:28.150 --> 01:31:28.950]
of the origin of pure tree

[01:31:30.370 --> 01:31:37.170]
Brainwashing of America baby. It's alive and well. Make no mistake about it. Ain't it? Oh, yeah. How does machines do when over their Gulf Stream?

[01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:39.930]
Hmm, isn't that exciting?

[01:31:41.090 --> 01:31:47.290]
Now you do realize next time that I'm down there. Can you imagine? Can you see me go into that place? No? Why not?

[01:31:47.970 --> 01:31:52.150]
I don't know because you got lots of places up there to go to. Yeah, that's right

[01:31:52.150 --> 01:31:56.170]
Why not when I come down there while I like plunge my gut so especially with that American currency

[01:31:56.170 --> 01:32:00.550]
That cheesy American cash slide nose America those hundreds in there

[01:32:03.270 --> 01:32:08.390]
One one thing about and let me just say this to you don't say I didn't warn you if you have an addictive personality

[01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:11.370]
Yeah, I know slots are very addictive

[01:32:12.630 --> 01:32:18.830]
Don't get started. I beg your pardon if you have an addictive personality don't get started that that's why I was just gonna settle on the blind

[01:32:19.850 --> 01:32:23.370]
Start anything and then don't say always either fleecey my money

[01:32:23.370 --> 01:32:29.630]
I got no chance of a well and don't go there nobody's gonna drag you off the street and with a sky hook and drag you inside the building okay?

[01:32:30.830 --> 01:32:37.250]
We're just telling you that right up front and the other thing I wanted to say is speaking of a hundred dollar bills or whatever kind of bills you're talking about

[01:32:38.530 --> 01:32:40.970]
Money loses its meaning in a casino

[01:32:41.730 --> 01:32:47.110]
Not just it's thought machines anything you're playing blackjack a crafts whatever it is money money loses its value

[01:32:47.830 --> 01:32:51.690]
And so like when you're sitting there shoving in a hundred dollar bills one after the other like I do

[01:32:52.050 --> 01:32:56.370]
It's like it's like monopoly money. It's like funny money. It's not like real money

[01:32:57.230 --> 01:33:01.870]
You know what I'm saying? I know it's an okay started mr. Hatch. I know you'll be there at 205

[01:33:01.870 --> 01:33:06.110]
I can just see you right now listen like you said earlier in the show

[01:33:06.710 --> 01:33:11.770]
Take as much as you were able to lose right okay, which in your case is not nothing

[01:33:11.770 --> 01:33:14.190]
So there you go and a story now as Josh already gone

[01:33:14.190 --> 01:33:20.130]
I heard Josh is gonna be giving us a live report from Gulfstream. I should have I should have went down you should have gone down there man should take in your cell

[01:33:21.290 --> 01:33:24.770]
Called in we wouldn't answer the phone, but nevertheless you tell me I'll leave right now

[01:33:25.330 --> 01:33:29.770]
I'll even play a slot or two. Don't be playing no slots mr. Hatch. I

[01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:31.750]
Don't get started

[01:33:33.490 --> 01:33:39.610]
Loo dobs has a column here. You know your buddy Loo dobs the your hero and the arch enemy of hoes illegal aliens

[01:33:41.150 --> 01:33:50.110]
He says I'm a populist and proud of it. Should I read Lou dobs column? I

[01:33:50.110 --> 01:33:57.810]
just the Democratic victory last week has our politically elites in both parties and national meatly media squealing like and I look at us the right hand column

[01:33:57.810 --> 01:34:01.170]
This is all chopped off. I can't read it good. I didn't want to read anyone

[01:34:03.710 --> 01:34:05.730]
Say sometimes it's like a blessing in disguise

[01:34:07.050 --> 01:34:13.250]
That was sensational. I know if I knew how to print out a story from I know you do know how you just don't want it

[01:34:13.250 --> 01:34:18.670]
I don't want I'm lazy. I don't want I don't want to do like that you were lazy he would do it the other way

[01:34:19.670 --> 01:34:26.230]
What does that mean you're going through more work than you need to by how am I going through more work because it's spitting out all these pages

[01:34:26.230 --> 01:34:28.290]
And you got to sift through all that crap to find what you want

[01:34:29.450 --> 01:34:33.490]
Instead of just get everything you want on one page. Did you say sift? I said sift

[01:34:34.710 --> 01:34:39.110]
Oh, we got almost 1100 votes now when the when the next slot machine goes off weight

[01:34:39.110 --> 01:34:41.210]
There it is. There's that report from Gulfstream

[01:34:43.250 --> 01:34:45.390]
We'll have 1100 votes in fact. I'm gonna refresh it

[01:34:45.390 --> 01:34:48.930]
There's that obnoxious Mitch McConnell of Kentucky another real Yehu

[01:34:49.570 --> 01:34:54.870]
Why is it that most of the Republicans are Yehu's one of those things is to go hand in hand with their philosophy

[01:34:54.870 --> 01:34:58.090]
And over the mentality with their stone age mentality a repressive

[01:34:59.090 --> 01:35:01.070]
Hypocritical BS you know it

[01:35:03.310 --> 01:35:10.730]
1095 votes on a pool 1097 if I keep refreshing it look at that that like a magic just like just like those godfather and

[01:35:10.730 --> 01:35:14.710]
And very glad to hear our roster. I'm amazing. How do you do that? I don't know

[01:35:14.710 --> 01:35:21.350]
Johnny Fontay will never get that movie. I don't care how many day go get you what free spot goombas come out of the wood worth

[01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:25.050]
I'm German Irish. Well, let me tell you something my crout mech friend

[01:35:25.050 --> 01:35:29.910]
I'm gonna make so much trouble for you. You won't know what it was come the lawyer. I have not threatened

[01:35:29.910 --> 01:35:33.830]
I know almost every big lawyer in New York. Who the hell are you? Who the hell are you?

[01:35:34.390 --> 01:35:35.610]
Be some hair say to me york

[01:35:36.370 --> 01:35:40.990]
Oh 1099 again. It's there must be a tax thing. I mean 01100 we got it. Told you

[01:35:42.350 --> 01:35:45.410]
Boy 1100 votes on a poll. It's only 1211

[01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:52.450]
I think the reason we're doing so well on the polls like this because that drew Rosenstein burger house show now in the morning on Wednesday

[01:35:52.450 --> 01:35:54.710]
Is there any doubt on our morning show there can be no doubt

[01:35:55.290 --> 01:35:57.570]
No doubt about it. He is the man

[01:35:58.270 --> 01:36:01.350]
Reviled by most and hated by some by many

[01:36:02.070 --> 01:36:07.130]
But nevertheless we got him and then of course there's Ira windbag look what I would did for hang show in the morning

[01:36:07.790 --> 01:36:09.310]
Now when you got a loser like that

[01:36:09.310 --> 01:36:13.630]
Well like Ira when you keep bringing him back again and foisting him on everybody you couldn't try to destroy their show

[01:36:13.630 --> 01:36:15.350]
I haven't modeled your day you bet

[01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:20.590]
I say give him his own damn show like from 6 to 10 a.m. And like from uh to the midnight

[01:36:22.030 --> 01:36:26.970]
Just pay the other guys to lay out a little bit mad dog and hang they pay their dues just pay him to do you know

[01:36:26.970 --> 01:36:30.410]
I mean like mad dog he does X number of shows a year. What a scam. He's got

[01:36:31.210 --> 01:36:36.430]
Really how many shows a year does he know that he does a certain number shows a year

[01:36:37.930 --> 01:36:41.570]
And that's it and once once beyond that that said he won't do no mole

[01:36:43.130 --> 01:36:48.510]
That a good deal. It's a great. Like I said, I'll do 50 shows a year for you know for the same money, but like that

[01:36:49.550 --> 01:36:53.850]
And I'll show up when a breakfast you're like it in other words just tune in and see if I'm there that would be a lot of fun

[01:36:54.430 --> 01:36:59.310]
Yeah, and see if Niels on it like the wheel summer show right what is it like spin the wheel of Neil

[01:36:59.790 --> 01:37:03.970]
The wheel of meat. Oh, let's get Rick and suds back with the wheel of meat. No absolutely not

[01:37:04.970 --> 01:37:08.710]
But I was really a dumb bit you know that where the hell did he come up with that you know that's Rick

[01:37:09.250 --> 01:37:13.990]
Of course, you know, I wasn't suds his idea that had to be Rick right the wheel of meat

[01:37:15.870 --> 01:37:17.210]
So speaking of redneck

[01:37:19.530 --> 01:37:26.670]
To this is Neil Rogers for radio 560. You a.m. She works in

[01:37:26.670 --> 01:37:29.550]
The old big apple

[01:37:30.670 --> 01:37:34.350]
When we singing about living in that white house castle

[01:37:35.470 --> 01:37:39.370]
In four years she'll have an election to tackle

[01:37:40.670 --> 01:37:42.490]
Good Lord, don't let everyone

[01:37:42.490 --> 01:37:47.470]
Good Lord, don't let everyone

[01:37:50.610 --> 01:37:52.130]
One's another friend

[01:37:52.130 --> 01:37:52.610]
No

[01:37:54.870 --> 01:37:57.330]
If she wins we're finished and done

[01:37:58.870 --> 01:38:02.130]
Oh, yeah, so good Lord, don't let everyone

[01:38:06.070 --> 01:38:13.190]
Probably 18 at 560 WQM. It's don't forget Obama be the man Obama from Alabama with a banjo on his name a rack

[01:38:14.690 --> 01:38:19.950]
Homeowner should be able to get bare bones property insurance with hired deductibles coverage for only part of their home's value

[01:38:19.950 --> 01:38:24.890]
Or even a policy that doesn't cover hurricane damage according to planned recommendations from a state panel

[01:38:26.170 --> 01:38:32.770]
Floridians have seen hurricane premiums go through the roof in last few years. Yeah, I know I know all about it

[01:38:33.230 --> 01:38:38.350]
You want to pay my homeowner's insurance for this year? No, thanks, but I've got mine's more not by name

[01:38:38.350 --> 01:38:45.950]
I'm east of 95 mandatory wind store. I said you pay yours. I'll pay that with eight hurricanes having affected the state in the last few years

[01:38:45.950 --> 01:38:52.010]
Forecast for more active storm period of scared insurers who say they paid out billions and claims and are worried about insolvency

[01:38:52.010 --> 01:38:59.430]
Going out of business just like us here at QAM and over across the way at power 96 where they brought back Greg Reed because they were ill and over there

[01:39:00.030 --> 01:39:01.510]
That is really it's just

[01:39:02.110 --> 01:39:03.610]
It just blows my mind

[01:39:04.830 --> 01:39:08.090]
You know somewhere out there. There's a murder run loose. You know that where

[01:39:08.930 --> 01:39:15.150]
Somewhere oh summers the insurance crisis has flummoxed state policy makers because insurance companies have warned

[01:39:15.150 --> 01:39:19.050]
It's flummoxed them because insurance companies have warned the rates must go up

[01:39:19.050 --> 01:39:24.050]
And those companies are to continue offering their products in Florida a special task force named by fat ass governor

[01:39:24.050 --> 01:39:29.610]
Bush decided to problem make recommendation lawmakers is finishing its work with its final meeting going on two day

[01:39:29.610 --> 01:39:34.370]
And it's 12-19. You know where your lose changes now and what machine it's in mind

[01:39:36.370 --> 01:39:41.270]
A draft of likely recommendations included a number of proposals that would lessen the risk of property insurance companies

[01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:45.110]
Many by essentially allow a homeowner's to take on greater risk themselves

[01:39:45.670 --> 01:39:47.550]
By being allowed to sell scaled-on policies

[01:39:47.550 --> 01:39:49.970]
Companies could offer lower rates to thinking goes

[01:39:50.550 --> 01:39:56.490]
Currently most companies don't sell policies for some peril such as fire or think whole damage without selling wind coverage

[01:39:57.190 --> 01:40:00.950]
The property and casualty insurance reform committees expected to recommend a change in that policy

[01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:04.390]
Such a change would allow a homeowner to buy a coverage for personal contents

[01:40:04.390 --> 01:40:08.410]
Fire theft or other types of coverage for example, but reject wind coverage

[01:40:09.490 --> 01:40:13.370]
Mortgage holders wouldn't be able to buy such limited policies because their bank will require full coverage

[01:40:13.370 --> 01:40:20.670]
But some could including some mobile homeowner's others who paid off their home such as retirees who sold their homes up north and paid cash for their Florida house

[01:40:21.870 --> 01:40:26.050]
Consumers should also be able to choose higher deductibles and ensure only the value of the outstanding part of their mortgage

[01:40:26.050 --> 01:40:29.970]
The panel suggested most of the proposals would need legislative approval fat ass

[01:40:29.970 --> 01:40:32.750]
Bush has said that if lawmakers can reach a consensus on what to do

[01:40:32.750 --> 01:40:37.990]
He may call a special legislative session to tackle some of the potential fixes before he leaves orifice

[01:40:38.410 --> 01:40:44.490]
In January other recommendations in the panels for after post-impleant would making it easier for companies to get coverage from the state fund

[01:40:44.490 --> 01:40:49.530]
That backs up insurance companies the hurricane catastrophe fund and making that coverage a bit more expensive

[01:40:49.530 --> 01:40:54.130]
Posted about private re-insurance companies charge and it goes on but it'd be pitiful in other words

[01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:57.210]
We're getting raped it and we better enjoy it sit back and enjoy it

[01:40:57.210 --> 01:40:58.510]
All right, think of England

[01:40:59.350 --> 01:41:05.010]
Put a smile on your face and let the joys ask for your umbrella. What was that crap? You used to say that line?

[01:41:06.990 --> 01:41:07.390]
Oh

[01:41:07.390 --> 01:41:08.430]
Let us your buddy Joey

[01:41:09.110 --> 01:41:15.190]
Let us smile be your enrella burl and rain on your face out of it. Yeah, it's definitely the senior US government officials say yesterday

[01:41:15.190 --> 01:41:19.010]
They're rattling their Britney Spears again. How do you like that? They're rattling it again?

[01:41:21.430 --> 01:41:25.650]
The US and it's out by the way, I just was looking at one of those websites. They're looking for my buddy

[01:41:26.210 --> 01:41:30.790]
Well, I got so many now and that was your buddy Ryan Philippi was on there Philippi but flippy

[01:41:31.510 --> 01:41:35.110]
Almost naked and one of the things said boy sure is a lot prettier than his wife

[01:41:35.790 --> 01:41:38.490]
And you agree with that my ass is prettier than his wife

[01:41:38.490 --> 01:41:42.490]
Well, there you go and then the picture I had in there in the inquiries she looked really nice

[01:41:42.490 --> 01:41:45.970]
You know, you can do a lot of say hot photo man type it lukewarm, you know

[01:41:46.610 --> 01:41:49.530]
Not as hot as he is but then again. She scared white children

[01:41:50.050 --> 01:41:54.810]
US and its allies have accused a random pursuing nuclear weapons out of the guys of a civilian energy program

[01:41:54.810 --> 01:41:59.930]
And are pushing for U.N. sanctions. They ran of course denies the accusation. That's our buddy Akmanina jod

[01:42:01.230 --> 01:42:01.990]
Come on

[01:42:03.190 --> 01:42:08.370]
I'm sorry from slow put I'm not in the job see I've reached it to us very even close

[01:42:09.610 --> 01:42:13.590]
If North Korea refused to be announced its nuclear program in a random update nuclear weapons capability

[01:42:13.590 --> 01:42:18.350]
Would lead other countries in the regions of state nuclear weapons at the US official speaking on condition of anonymity

[01:42:18.350 --> 01:42:20.330]
Of course because he values his life a lot

[01:42:21.530 --> 01:42:26.010]
We the US and others who might be threatened by these developments will have to look at how to respond and inevitably

[01:42:26.010 --> 01:42:30.650]
I think people will have to look at the question of preemption the official total reporters preemption here

[01:42:30.650 --> 01:42:36.890]
We go again if you like the Iraq just wait you ain't see nothing yet. You can think things are going swimmingly well there just wait

[01:42:38.610 --> 01:42:42.270]
He said I think it's inevitable that any American administration not just this one

[01:42:42.270 --> 01:42:45.590]
But future administrations will have to look at preemptive strategies

[01:42:46.270 --> 01:42:47.950]
We get them before they get us

[01:42:48.710 --> 01:42:51.970]
Right he wasn't saying that the US was going to launch a preemptive strike tomorrow

[01:42:51.970 --> 01:42:55.150]
He said maybe a week from next circus or something like that

[01:42:55.150 --> 01:42:57.630]
Circus was in our country by the way

[01:42:57.630 --> 01:43:02.510]
We look up all those holidays already and we got Thanksgiving a week from tomorrow and then we start heavy duty baby

[01:43:03.570 --> 01:43:07.970]
After Thanksgiving we start really really isn't it today after Thanksgiving Friday the 24th

[01:43:07.970 --> 01:43:13.610]
That's the big shopping day the number one shopping day and everybody goes out to rushing around by in their Hanukkah and Christmas gifts

[01:43:14.430 --> 01:43:15.070]
That's the day

[01:43:15.970 --> 01:43:21.270]
I'm looking I'm looking for a story to buy all my stuff which I don't buy gifts for anybody because I'm a hard roll the Jew but

[01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:24.970]
I'm looking for a story where they say happy holidays

[01:43:25.750 --> 01:43:26.150]
Okay

[01:43:27.170 --> 01:43:32.090]
All right, or maybe just have a great life or maybe just I have no life that would be good as opposed to all this or maybe

[01:43:32.090 --> 01:43:36.630]
Nothing is how about leave me alone. Let me buy what I want and get the hell out of here and don't talk to me

[01:43:36.630 --> 01:43:38.810]
Exactly and quit proselytizing okay

[01:43:38.810 --> 01:43:44.470]
I if I want to go to church or to shoole. I'll go there if I want to buy something I'll come here you want my money fine if not

[01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:51.990]
Yeah, where the moon don't jump been drared. I took in your took us a bubble and drared. Yeah, how about a poch and took us

[01:43:54.450 --> 01:43:56.790]
Please don't tell me that he's Jewish all right about it

[01:43:58.170 --> 01:44:01.110]
Oh, let's see. Where's uh, I'm looking for something right here. I'll find it

[01:44:01.990 --> 01:44:05.010]
My mom and please oh there it is. Oh boy. That's something else

[01:44:05.870 --> 01:44:06.230]
Anyway

[01:44:08.930 --> 01:44:14.950]
We have 1129 votes on the pool. Let's see how we're doing on the reads on the stories today. Okay. You never can be too

[01:44:14.950 --> 01:44:18.910]
Too sure about this town, you know, even though it's been 30 years

[01:44:18.910 --> 01:44:23.470]
We've got this big lawyer audience. It's wonderful. We love them. They sometimes love us usually not

[01:44:24.210 --> 01:44:27.890]
Well, look at that. We got over 300 reads bush and rogue blue the election on purpose question mark

[01:44:27.890 --> 01:44:29.710]
Which is a silly story but read it anyway

[01:44:30.370 --> 01:44:33.270]
Did you read that no don't waste your time all right

[01:44:34.570 --> 01:44:41.070]
Oh, you're like this story though when Polish student Michael Gromack 19 went to America on a student exchange program

[01:44:41.670 --> 01:44:44.970]
He found himself trapped in a host family of Christian fundamentalists

[01:44:45.730 --> 01:44:53.410]
What followed was a six-month hell of dawn church visits and sex education talks is his new family tried to banish the devil from his soul

[01:44:53.410 --> 01:44:57.850]
Here is his story my half year of hell with Christian fundamentalists

[01:44:58.790 --> 01:45:01.370]
I think we're gonna take the break. I don't want to like read this too fast

[01:45:01.790 --> 01:45:02.190]
Okay

[01:45:02.970 --> 01:45:07.890]
Michael Gromack Polish exchange. I see the reason that this is of interest to use because you know your daughter went to Japan

[01:45:07.890 --> 01:45:14.590]
You had a little of Japanese girl you did a student exchange thing right and luckily the Japanese girl didn't come to some family of getch keys

[01:45:14.590 --> 01:45:18.970]
We're trying to brainwash her. It it happens every once in a while. What's that?

[01:45:19.670 --> 01:45:25.030]
That these exchange students wind up like the story that you're about to read in the in the house of some religious phonetic

[01:45:25.030 --> 01:45:28.290]
Yeah, isn't that so I think there ought to be a log against that

[01:45:28.290 --> 01:45:30.370]
You know, it's one thing to pollute the minds of American kids

[01:45:30.370 --> 01:45:37.530]
But to bring in people unsuspecting people's children from around the rest of the uh a little slightly more enlightened world and try to write the Polish for example

[01:45:37.530 --> 01:45:41.790]
The biggest name of best talent the basis wheel roger

[01:45:42.350 --> 01:45:43.610]
Somebody like my sister

[01:45:44.750 --> 01:45:53.690]
Know that the Lord even loves Neil Rodd 1231 and 560 WQM all the bubble my sees all the time baby all the religious killing and hate all the time

[01:45:53.690 --> 01:45:59.330]
Mm-hmm. Anyway getting back to Michael Gromack 19 he was um an exchange student from Poland

[01:46:00.030 --> 01:46:05.710]
Okay, and this is a story in a nutshell briefly says when I got out of the plane in Greensboro on the US state of North Carolina

[01:46:06.490 --> 01:46:13.730]
I would never have expected my host family to welcome me at the airport wielding a Bible and saying child our Lord sent you halfway around the world to bring you to us

[01:46:14.390 --> 01:46:17.490]
At that moment. I just wanted to turn around and run back to the plane. He said

[01:46:18.510 --> 01:46:22.130]
Things began to go wrong as soon as I arrived in my new home in Winston Salem

[01:46:22.570 --> 01:46:24.310]
Why was to spend my year abroad?

[01:46:24.530 --> 01:46:28.790]
For example every Monday my host family would gather around the kitchen table to talk about sex

[01:46:29.450 --> 01:46:35.370]
My host parents hadn't had sex for the last 17 years because so they told me they were devoting their lives to God

[01:46:36.030 --> 01:46:39.630]
They also want to know whether I drank alcohol. I admitted. I'd like beer and wine

[01:46:40.230 --> 01:46:43.010]
They told me I had to they told me I had to devil in my heart

[01:46:45.230 --> 01:46:48.370]
My host parents treated me like a five-year-old they gave me lollipops

[01:46:48.370 --> 01:46:52.310]
They woke me up every Sunday morning at 615 a.m. Saying Michael it's time to go to church

[01:46:53.030 --> 01:46:58.530]
I hated that sentence when I didn't want to go to church one morning because that hardly slept. They didn't allow me to have any coffee

[01:46:59.710 --> 01:47:03.110]
One day I was talking to my host parents about my mother who separated from my father

[01:47:03.110 --> 01:47:06.870]
They were appalled my mother's heart was just as possessed by the devil's mind

[01:47:06.870 --> 01:47:09.610]
They explained God wanted her to stay with her husband. They said

[01:47:11.270 --> 01:47:15.430]
Then seeing as we were already on the topic of God's will the religious zealots finally brought up a subject

[01:47:15.430 --> 01:47:17.810]
Which had clearly been on their minds for a long time

[01:47:18.350 --> 01:47:24.250]
They wanted me to help them set up a fundamentalist back to church in my home country of Poland. It was God's will they said

[01:47:24.970 --> 01:47:28.390]
They tried to slip the topic casually in the conversation, but it really shocked me

[01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:31.130]
I realized that was the only reason they had welcomed me into their family

[01:47:31.130 --> 01:47:36.890]
Then already started a construction work in Krakow. I was to help them with translations and with spreading their faith via the media

[01:47:38.090 --> 01:47:43.050]
It was clear to me that there was no way I was going to do that the family was appalled. It was a weird situation

[01:47:43.550 --> 01:47:47.990]
After all these people were my only company at the time if I hadn't kept in touch with home through email

[01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:49.810]
I might have been sucked into that world

[01:47:50.850 --> 01:47:52.070]
Or just plain well

[01:47:52.070 --> 01:47:55.210]
It was only after four months that I decided to change my host family

[01:47:55.210 --> 01:47:57.710]
I kept hoping that things might improve but it was futile

[01:47:58.170 --> 01:47:58.530]
futile

[01:47:59.030 --> 01:48:02.270]
Telling them I wanted to go was the most unpleasant moment I experienced in that half year

[01:48:02.270 --> 01:48:06.170]
Of course they didn't understand how good they they had grown up with their faith and were convinced of it

[01:48:06.170 --> 01:48:08.470]
And then suddenly I turned up and refused to fit in

[01:48:08.850 --> 01:48:13.590]
From that moment on I counted the days the two months that followed my decision were hell

[01:48:14.270 --> 01:48:19.370]
My host parents detested me. There were constant rouse. I could sense they just wanted to get rid of me

[01:48:19.370 --> 01:48:20.930]
They didn't know what to do with me no more

[01:48:22.110 --> 01:48:24.330]
67 days later. I was finally in a new family

[01:48:24.330 --> 01:48:28.010]
They were young actually more friends than host parents and I was very happy there

[01:48:28.010 --> 01:48:31.410]
Because my new family was only 50 kilometers 30 miles away from the other one

[01:48:31.410 --> 01:48:35.370]
I was distrustful at first and afraid things wouldn't be no better. But the change was worth it

[01:48:36.370 --> 01:48:38.850]
Despite everything I still haven't come to terms with my experience

[01:48:38.850 --> 01:48:43.970]
I want to write the religious family soon and explain to them clearly and calmly why things went so wrong

[01:48:43.970 --> 01:48:45.590]
It shouldn't just end

[01:48:46.170 --> 01:48:50.210]
This way what he's trying to say is they were real far-bison

[01:48:51.130 --> 01:48:55.190]
That's what he's trying to say and the exchange students are often very freaked out because

[01:48:55.190 --> 01:48:59.050]
Unlike the rest of us here in America who are used to being surrounded by these nut jobs

[01:48:59.050 --> 01:49:02.930]
They're not so prevalent in these other countries. That is correct. That is absolutely

[01:49:03.630 --> 01:49:07.810]
So they've ever you know, there are a lot of things that take them by surprise and that's why right

[01:49:08.430 --> 01:49:12.430]
Although every now and then you'll run into a getchki here for example in Toronto where they are on the street corners

[01:49:12.430 --> 01:49:17.170]
Anywhere you go into the world you find it's crazy people on the street corners handing out religious pamphlets

[01:49:17.890 --> 01:49:19.530]
And mumbling in articular garbage

[01:49:19.530 --> 01:49:21.470]
Like that because they're crazy

[01:49:23.730 --> 01:49:28.110]
Don't forget the religious people are the crazy people and the crazy people are the dangerous people

[01:49:28.110 --> 01:49:31.890]
You know what George always says about dangerous people they scare the crap out of us. That's right

[01:49:34.130 --> 01:49:41.510]
Fort Campbell, Kentucky one of four US soldiers accused of raping an Iraqi girl last spring and killing her and her family pleaded guilty today

[01:49:42.210 --> 01:49:43.790]
And will testify against the others

[01:49:44.670 --> 01:49:50.430]
Specialist James P. Barker agreed to the plea deal to avoid the death penalty said is a vaguen attorney David Sheldon

[01:49:51.350 --> 01:49:57.490]
The killings in Mach Moudia a village about 20 miles south of Baghdad. Don't you love the way I said that Mach Moudia great work

[01:49:57.490 --> 01:50:01.090]
See anywhere there's like an H in like any Arabic or

[01:50:01.090 --> 01:50:02.770]
Israeli or as it's always

[01:50:03.290 --> 01:50:09.150]
Like that get that get that deli there. We go on baby get those cheese buns. It's all worked up in your throat

[01:50:10.130 --> 01:50:11.010]
That's it

[01:50:11.010 --> 01:50:14.510]
The killings in Mach Moudia a village about 20 miles south of Baghdad

[01:50:14.510 --> 01:50:19.310]
We're among the worst in the series of alleged attacks on civilians other abuses by a military personnel in Iraq

[01:50:20.250 --> 01:50:25.650]
Sergeant Paul E. Cortez I wonder if he's kidded day baby Cortez and don't you dare play that happy organ again, please right

[01:50:26.530 --> 01:50:28.110]
Sergeant Paul E. Cortez and

[01:50:29.150 --> 01:50:34.490]
Private first fast Jesse V. Spielman both members of the 101st Airborne Division with Barker could face the death penalty

[01:50:34.490 --> 01:50:39.110]
If convicted in the case in courts Marshall at Fort Campbell courts Marshall. Don't you just love that?

[01:50:40.610 --> 01:50:41.010]
Yes

[01:50:41.690 --> 01:50:45.010]
I never was able to figure that out. I mean, you know, I was pretty good in a linguist

[01:50:45.770 --> 01:50:51.070]
In my day, although obviously the way I read these stories you'd never know that but anyway, well because court is the noun

[01:50:52.110 --> 01:50:56.390]
I understand that but still it's just it just don't seem to direct to me

[01:50:57.050 --> 01:51:03.910]
The alleged ringleader from our army private Steve green 21. Please not guilty last week to charge is including murder and sexual assault

[01:51:04.450 --> 01:51:12.090]
Green was discharged from the army for a personality disorder before the allegations became known and prosecutors have yet to say if they'll pursue the death penalty again him

[01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:17.290]
The indictment accused his green and others of raping the girl and burning her body to conceal their crimes

[01:51:17.290 --> 01:51:23.270]
It also alleges that green and for other states that nearby checkpoint killed the girl's father mother and 60-year-old sister

[01:51:23.270 --> 01:51:26.470]
Barker's given investigators vivid accounts of the assault

[01:51:26.930 --> 01:51:29.950]
How do you like that? I don't understand why they hate us

[01:51:29.950 --> 01:51:32.310]
Where is the candy in the flowers you promised us?

[01:51:32.310 --> 01:51:38.990]
Right just because they were playing that song. I never promised you a rose garden. Who did that Lynn Anderson? Yes, don't play it all right

[01:51:40.290 --> 01:51:46.070]
Oh Doug Thompson writes in the rant today. I don't know. This is what here. This is his opinion. All right

[01:51:50.970 --> 01:51:53.670]

[01:51:59.450 --> 01:52:00.630]

There we go and then of course there's always

[01:52:06.810 --> 01:52:07.250]
Yeah

[01:52:08.870 --> 01:52:12.230]
Oh, yeah, what a finger man. What a fast finger

[01:52:13.150 --> 01:52:16.770]
Maybe Brady Quinn could find out how fast that finger is man. Whoo

[01:52:17.510 --> 01:52:18.530]
Wash it off now

[01:52:19.430 --> 01:52:24.090]
I'll speak of that. Murtha is too dirty to lead Democrats. That's the article by Doug Thompson on capital blue.com

[01:52:24.090 --> 01:52:25.510]
It's too dirty. Go wash it off

[01:52:26.090 --> 01:52:27.930]
But it's just a purple ink stain. I voted

[01:52:29.010 --> 01:52:33.410]
Incoming speaker with a house Nancy Pelosi promises changes in the correct way Congress conducts his business

[01:52:33.410 --> 01:52:40.770]
But her shameless promotion of Pennsylvania representative John Murtha suggests her reign at the top will be business as usual when it comes to protecting one of her own

[01:52:41.290 --> 01:52:44.870]
One of the first rules of politics is to avoid the appearance of impropriety

[01:52:44.870 --> 01:52:49.410]
It doesn't matter if you're guilty or innocent of wrongdoing you must work your ass off to prove you're above suspicion

[01:52:50.110 --> 01:52:52.510]
Murtha unfortunately doesn't pass the smell test

[01:52:52.510 --> 01:53:00.950]
Hmm he has a long history of pandering to fat catalogues manipulating the system for personal gain and using the power of office to benefit his family and friends

[01:53:01.450 --> 01:53:09.070]
And then there's abscan the FBI sting operation that targeted 31 elected officials and convicted a senator and five congressman of robbery and conspiracy

[01:53:09.070 --> 01:53:14.130]
Murtha was one of those targeted because of his cozy relationship with defense lobbyists in a videotape

[01:53:14.130 --> 01:53:15.590]
Which they showed on the news last night

[01:53:15.590 --> 01:53:19.370]
Murtha turned down a bribe of $50,000 from an undercover FBI agent

[01:53:19.370 --> 01:53:22.650]
Not because he felt it was wrong, but to use his words because he didn't know him

[01:53:23.310 --> 01:53:24.850]
I'm not interested at this point

[01:53:24.850 --> 01:53:28.410]
Murtha said we do business for a while. Maybe I'll be interested. Maybe I won't

[01:53:28.990 --> 01:53:34.950]
Not interested at this point do business for a while or these the comments of an honest man or one who's just being careful careful

[01:53:36.050 --> 01:53:38.810]
An honest man would have stalked out of the room reported the attempted bribe

[01:53:38.810 --> 01:53:39.690]
Murtha didn't do either one

[01:53:39.690 --> 01:53:43.850]
He sat there and left it open for a future relationship with the man who openly offered him a bribe

[01:53:43.850 --> 01:53:46.390]
Murtha said he didn't do anything wrong. He's lying

[01:53:46.390 --> 01:53:51.250]
But not reporting the attempted bribe became complicit in the corruption that's long been part of life on capital hill

[01:53:51.250 --> 01:53:58.930]
By keeping his mouth shut he gave support to a system that still exists today even with things like abscan and current scandals like jack abermoth

[01:53:59.510 --> 01:54:04.130]
Pelosi promises to clean up congress and with the public garbage looked by republicans should lead a big broom

[01:54:04.730 --> 01:54:06.810]
But any claim maybe she needs the swiffer duster

[01:54:07.730 --> 01:54:12.990]
But any claims of restoring integrity to the government are invalidated when she openly backs the congressman with a checkered past

[01:54:12.990 --> 01:54:15.450]
And answered on answered questions about his ethics

[01:54:16.050 --> 01:54:20.750]
Murtha claims bringing up abscam is a swift boating a tech engineer by a opponent for a house leader job

[01:54:20.750 --> 01:54:23.870]
Merlin representative stenny hoyer so much for democratic unity

[01:54:24.730 --> 01:54:30.230]
Pelosi's actions as speaker will be scrutinized at microscopic levels given her position as the first woman to ever hold a job

[01:54:30.230 --> 01:54:33.950]
And her promises to turn congressman the most ethical legislative body in history

[01:54:33.950 --> 01:54:38.170]
Dealing with Murtha here was her first test and she flunked it

[01:54:38.170 --> 01:54:40.850]

1245 speaking of that the South African parliament yesterday approved new legislation and recognizing game marriages

[01:55:07.950 --> 01:55:12.130]
How do you like that a first for a continent where homosexuality is largely taboo

[01:55:12.990 --> 01:55:19.690]
The national assembly passed the civil union bill worked out after months of heated public discussion by a vote of 230 to 41

[01:55:20.270 --> 01:55:23.870]
The spec criticism from both traditionalist and gay activists in warnings that it might be

[01:55:24.690 --> 01:55:26.510]
Unconstitutional. There were three abstentions

[01:55:26.950 --> 01:55:28.130]
203 to 41

[01:55:28.670 --> 01:55:33.550]
The bill provides for the voluntary union of two persons which is solemnized and registered not sourmized

[01:55:33.550 --> 01:55:36.270]
But solemnized and registered by either a marriage or civil union

[01:55:36.270 --> 01:55:39.330]
It doesn't specify whether they are heterosexual or homosexual partnerships

[01:55:39.330 --> 01:55:43.550]
But it also says marriage officers need not perform a ceremony between same-sex couples

[01:55:43.550 --> 01:55:47.290]
If doing so would conflict with his or her conscience religion and belief

[01:55:48.110 --> 01:55:52.610]
When we obtained our democracy we started to distinguish ourselves from an unjust painful past

[01:56:06.930 --> 01:56:12.670]
The bill have been expected to pass given the overwhelming majority of the ruling African national congress despite unease among rank and file lawmakers

[01:56:12.670 --> 01:56:18.030]

They're so flagrant. It's so obvious and there's so many stupid people out there who actually are condoned and believe like it's a news organization

Fox News and oxymor enough there ever was one Fox News my ass

[01:56:38.010 --> 01:56:42.970]

Can one fake smile how that hide that much frustration will take that too

[01:57:20.110 --> 01:57:23.510]
The elections in Ramesfeld's resignation were a major event, but not the end of the world

[01:57:23.510 --> 01:57:25.350]
The war on terror goes on without interruption

And let's be on the lookout for any statements from Iraqi insurgents who must be thrilled at the prospect of a democratic controlled congress

[01:57:35.650 --> 01:57:39.990]
The question of the day and indeed for the rest of Bush's term is what's the democratic plan for Iraq

German law allows the pursuit of cases originating anywhere in the world state prosecutors have yet to decide whether to pursue the case and

[01:59:03.930 --> 01:59:06.670]
An earlier request in case in 2004 was dropped

[01:59:07.610 --> 01:59:11.030]
Michael Ratner the sentence president said he felt the case had a better chance to succeed

[01:59:11.030 --> 01:59:12.150]
Now because mr

[01:59:12.150 --> 01:59:15.850]
Rumsfeld was no longer in office could exert the same political pressure

[01:59:16.550 --> 01:59:19.250]
He ended that the center had more evidence than it did in 2004

[01:59:19.250 --> 01:59:22.650]
Setting the case of detained Saudi national Muhammad al-Katani

[01:59:23.150 --> 01:59:29.950]
Al-Katani was a man who the U.S. alleged is al-Qaeda who is in Gipmo and was exposed to the entire torture log of al-Katani over a period of two months

[01:59:29.950 --> 01:59:30.950]
they told the BBC

[01:59:32.130 --> 01:59:39.910]
The Center for constitutional rights argues that Rumsfeld was instrumental in the torture being committed to Gipmo and that the jail Abu Gharr in Baghdad

[01:59:40.650 --> 01:59:45.330]
And it goes on how do you like that? Well, we got Henry Kissinger's wanted in France for war crimes

[01:59:45.330 --> 01:59:50.250]
And then we got Kissinger in Germany. Let's put them on a plane together and send him over there for a nice hanging

[01:59:52.150 --> 01:59:56.890]
Speaking of crazy people by the way Rudy Giuliani. He's got he's got two chances of getting the Republican

[01:59:57.750 --> 01:59:58.110]
nomination

[01:59:59.030 --> 02:00:02.270]
Did I say this yesterday? I'll say it again. Not much less than none

[02:00:04.910 --> 02:00:09.330]
Wait to hear this I read totally before the shawjina told it you'll fall off the chair. Do you fall yet?

[02:00:10.410 --> 02:00:16.070]
I'm getting ready to do it. Giuliani compares Bush to Winston Churchill. Oh my god. I heard that story

[02:00:16.530 --> 02:00:23.530]
It looks like someone else is in a state of Nile says yesterday former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani set up that exploratory committee for a possible run

[02:00:23.530 --> 02:00:28.550]
If the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 Arizona Senator John McCain made a similar announcement over the weekend

[02:00:29.190 --> 02:00:35.830]
It is likely that Bill Fist, Mitt Romney, George Potaki and Mike Huckabee will do the same in coming weeks my Huckabee my ass who now is that

[02:00:36.950 --> 02:00:42.450]
As of now if he does indeed run Giuliani will try to gain Republican support by co-zing up to president Bush

[02:00:42.930 --> 02:00:50.710]
The former New York mayor defended George W. Bush yesterday even comparing the recent anti-Bush sentiment to the kind that the late Winston Churchill received years ago

[02:00:51.530 --> 02:00:55.250]
It doesn't matter what the media does to ridicule him or misinterpret him or defeat him

[02:00:55.250 --> 02:01:02.190]
They ridicule Winston Churchill. They be little Ronald Reagan, but like president Bush. They were optimists said Rudy Giuliani

[02:01:02.750 --> 02:01:09.150]
Who is one of the worst things he's got going for him is beside the ugly divorce and all the flandering is that his name ends in a vowel

[02:01:10.210 --> 02:01:17.830]
I think he needs a good vowel movement Rudy Giuliani and of course this former chief of police who was using that the love nest over there across from the World Trade Center

[02:01:17.830 --> 02:01:23.790]
That they're gonna hang around his leg like an albatross driven by Harry Harvey and later by Stanley dancer the lead

[02:01:24.810 --> 02:01:30.230]
Here's a fact that since after exercising my road to Biden vote and in doing so chose Democrats across the board

[02:01:30.230 --> 02:01:36.410]
I'm an independent when I heard about the policy and their support for Martha and Elsie Hastings because she didn't like two other people running even though they had no baggage

[02:01:36.410 --> 02:01:41.490]
I was as pissed off of her as I am at the Republicans. I hope she burns in hell the lying deceptive

[02:01:41.490 --> 02:01:46.750]
See any rights be out stop with his nonsense. Well, yeah bitch bitch if you don't have the balls to say bitch

[02:01:46.750 --> 02:01:48.330]
Then you don't belong on the planet, okay?

[02:01:51.510 --> 02:01:52.490]
crap it's crap

[02:01:53.850 --> 02:01:57.410]
No, no, it's not just yo-yo. It's not just that black ease part of it. It's just

[02:01:58.110 --> 02:02:03.890]
People that don't want to say bitch. They say be out. You know, it's not funny. It's it's wimpy. Don't be a pussy man

[02:02:04.590 --> 02:02:11.310]
You be out. I hope she burns in hell the lying deceptive bitch perhaps the screams sound by the associated with her name is more fitting than we thought

[02:02:13.130 --> 02:02:15.850]
The screams sound by it associated with her name

[02:02:17.810 --> 02:02:20.970]
Is that it? Is right? I don't have anybody's talking about

[02:02:21.870 --> 02:02:25.830]
Nancy Pelosi. Well, what is that? I don't know. Those are canned screams is what we got

[02:02:27.570 --> 02:02:28.550]
Yeah, I don't know

[02:02:28.550 --> 02:02:34.470]
Just calm down, okay? Just don't get your nickers in a wad. Oh, there's John McCain

[02:02:35.890 --> 02:02:41.650]
I believe that more oracle other general abbasid is it but it would put about there all that over there's what he said about Iraq

[02:02:42.550 --> 02:02:43.130]
Everybody's dead

[02:02:44.510 --> 02:02:48.850]
1180 dialed up 1180 whm in Rochester one of the worst radio stations

[02:02:48.850 --> 02:02:54.710]
Although when I was a kid I used to win hockey tickets to Rochester Amherst game from Bob Turner who used to do the sport show on whm

[02:02:54.710 --> 02:02:56.030]
Not exciting no

[02:02:56.550 --> 02:03:00.790]
It was real exciting to turn on the radio and have him you know announced you know announced the names of the five winners

[02:03:00.790 --> 02:03:04.190]
Because who they wanted to go to hockey games anyway? Well, we had we did okay

[02:03:04.670 --> 02:03:06.310]
The Rochester Amherst baby

[02:03:07.730 --> 02:03:12.070]
I'm giving up football it's hockey season. The least are off to a good start. Panthers are really they're reeling

[02:03:12.070 --> 02:03:17.510]
They're not so hot. I don't I don't see how that franchise is gonna continue. I just I don't I mean I would call me crazy

[02:03:17.510 --> 02:03:22.330]
Crazy that last year you can't have you can't have a franchise with no crowd. There's no interest

[02:03:23.270 --> 02:03:27.230]
So I got a great idea. Let's do a hockey show. Oh, I'll get rimmer on the horn

[02:03:28.370 --> 02:03:34.390]
Jimmy Buffett has filed a lawsuit alleging that a galleistered merchant is unlawfully using his trademark to sell goods at an online store

[02:03:34.390 --> 02:03:35.830]
Jimmy Buffett now there's another

[02:03:36.550 --> 02:03:41.430]
Other real uh state of mind, you know like the rascal house like the forge Jimmy Buffett

[02:03:42.210 --> 02:03:45.610]
Oh, but he's the keys man. He's south-roading. He's uh, you know

[02:03:46.150 --> 02:03:50.330]
Yeah, that's right. Let me give you one word to describe him and his so-called music. Yep. That's it

[02:03:51.830 --> 02:03:53.990]
Little Miss Buffett said under Buffett

[02:03:55.330 --> 02:03:57.570]
Killing the curses. Okay, it's enough

[02:03:58.070 --> 02:04:01.830]
The lawsuit filed this week in federal court seeks to shut down Robert A. Card's website

[02:04:02.330 --> 02:04:09.350]
under one hut.com the lawsuit claims the website falsely represents itself as Jimmy Buffett's Margarita Villalon line store for merchandise

[02:04:10.210 --> 02:04:10.690]
Well

[02:04:11.230 --> 02:04:17.970]
A lawyer for Buffett said part of the problem is that some of the items on a website which sells clothing and beach themed novelties are overpriced to them

[02:04:18.570 --> 02:04:24.510]
Many of these products are ones a card is not even authorized to sell but primarily the problem is that in some cases the markup on the item

[02:04:24.510 --> 02:04:26.010]
Is as highest 50%

[02:04:26.710 --> 02:04:29.690]
lawyer Anthony Busby said oh, that's a good name Busby

[02:04:29.690 --> 02:04:32.210]
Mm-hmm, like that name like Busby Berkeley

[02:04:32.850 --> 02:04:35.470]
Jimmy Buffett's not in business to make money certainly not anymore

[02:04:35.470 --> 02:04:40.210]
He doesn't appreciate what this guy's been doing and based on his music. I'm glad he's not in business to make any money

[02:04:40.610 --> 02:04:46.650]
Songs bequited by Buffett 59 include Margarita Villal changes in latitude changes in attitude and cheaper run paradise

[02:04:47.490 --> 02:04:52.730]
Oh, what about come Monday? Yeah, that's when you can play it again come someone to them. I'm not on

[02:04:53.930 --> 02:04:56.690]
This is a song from you who've been with us wrong

[02:04:57.370 --> 02:04:59.630]
All you drew in Yahoo's

[02:05:00.630 --> 02:05:04.090]
Anchor's attorney Darryl Afel said he would vigorously oppose Buffett's efforts

[02:05:04.570 --> 02:05:09.270]
He said he would be buffem. He said Buffett is a financial empire trying to shut down a small business

[02:05:09.270 --> 02:05:13.930]
Calling to complain a classic case of David versus Goliath. It's like Wayne Heisinga and at poorer uh

[02:05:13.990 --> 02:05:18.630]
Uh, pizza guy remember that that's right. That's right

[02:05:18.630 --> 02:05:18.730]
That's right

[02:05:18.730 --> 02:05:21.410]
It was just his block. Yeah

[02:05:21.870 --> 02:05:27.630]
And he closed the poor bastard down in drill-mouther business nice go on Wayne you grave robber you maniac you pockmarked

[02:05:28.110 --> 02:05:28.550]
lunatic

[02:05:29.130 --> 02:05:32.390]
Hey carded already modified his website in response to complaints from Buffett's lawyers

[02:05:32.390 --> 02:05:35.290]
Regarding what they said were implied ties between the site and the singer

[02:05:36.270 --> 02:05:39.970]
After taking these steps into the faith to comply with these requests Jimmy Buffett then started

[02:05:39.970 --> 02:05:43.830]
Restraining word to shut down the site without any warning to mr. A carder myself as his attorney

[02:05:43.830 --> 02:05:46.070]
Afel said the site remained online yesterday

[02:05:46.070 --> 02:05:49.230]
Afel said need to heena ray card to be given notice of a restraining order

[02:05:49.750 --> 02:05:53.090]
A federal judge in Nevada shut down eight cards last week. I've said related Jimmy Buffett

[02:05:53.090 --> 02:05:57.070]
Which was called parrots of the Caribbean calm. Oh

[02:05:57.070 --> 02:05:59.310]

He really sucks. Well you guys don't like anybody do you know we don't

We like suds. I've never had a problem with Jimmy Buffett. I don't like him, but you know

[02:06:08.230 --> 02:06:12.330]
I don't like him. I don't like his music. I don't like that whole keys thing, you know

[02:06:13.170 --> 02:06:16.870]
I don't like the whole I mean how many years I've been in Florida over

[02:06:18.210 --> 02:06:20.690]
Never been to the keys never any desire to go there

And it doesn't remind me of with all due respect to let's see bitch

[02:06:25.670 --> 02:06:30.470]
There I said if the screen was what they play on air america when Pelosi's mentioned. I don't hear about air america

[02:06:36.130 --> 02:06:37.630]
Congratulations to butcher up a little bit

[02:06:41.730 --> 02:06:44.610]
Oh the keys and no interest in the keys and everything I don't

[02:06:45.570 --> 02:06:48.130]
Well, you don't like the beach I guess I mean you really have to go to the keys to get drunk

[02:06:48.130 --> 02:06:52.310]
Don't go to the keys you get stuck all the time right there by his house go to the keys to uh

[02:06:52.750 --> 02:06:54.790]
To go to beach and bow to the Queen

Yeah, a bunch of silly Queen yeah, I'm pointing and saying you fat man goes to the keys because of the facts. That's it. Oh

[02:07:02.690 --> 02:07:05.710]
Believe me me and here I don't need to go to the keys to see that

[02:07:06.630 --> 02:07:08.190]
So I'm the do-hour

[02:07:16.810 --> 02:07:17.410]

So friends I'm rush limbo with news of the hottest children's toy the scriptmas and I say Christmas because I believe there is a war on

Of course, I'm talking about the newest offering from eib toys

[02:07:34.750 --> 02:07:36.830]
Chico me Michael J. Fox

[02:07:37.570 --> 02:07:41.370]
Yes, that all that shakes uncontrollably when placed in front of a camera

[02:07:41.730 --> 02:07:44.770]
Or when seated in front of a congressional subcommittee

[02:07:45.890 --> 02:07:49.230]
And especially when being interviewed by Katie

[02:07:49.230 --> 02:07:49.930]
Quirk

[02:07:50.930 --> 02:07:56.930]
And when you squeeze its belly ladies and gentlemen they tickle me Michael J. Fox doll even speaks allow me the dumpster

[02:08:21.230 --> 02:08:27.690]
Oh god one oh three at five sixty w two and let's pass this along again all of it's only Wednesday

[02:08:27.690 --> 02:08:33.130]
But just remind me the next two days because I am very good for the world. Let's pass this along remember that OJ story that you read today and

[02:08:33.130 --> 02:08:36.650]
Two we can go and everything like that here's something sending it over and over and over again

[02:08:41.130 --> 02:08:41.490]
We

[02:08:41.490 --> 02:08:47.950]
Had that story about the OJ book and the TV show and all this other crap if I did it weeks ago from the inquiry

[02:08:47.950 --> 02:08:53.850]
Oh, man, and one of the first things I read on the year this morning was the story about OJ and the Fox two part the thing on the

[02:08:53.850 --> 02:08:57.210]
27 the 29th of this month and the fact that book is coming out on November 30th

[02:08:58.230 --> 02:09:04.870]
So stick it okay quit sending us stuff that we already know about and I'm sure must be on our website. Is it on there Josh? Let me take a look

[02:09:06.730 --> 02:09:12.510]
Let me take a puket I mean I know I said it to you, but is it on there for today or for tomorrow? Let's see

[02:09:15.410 --> 02:09:18.270]
Uh one moment please you see it

[02:09:18.950 --> 02:09:23.710]
See Josh would know if he really read these things thoroughly post-to-post just a joke

[02:09:23.710 --> 02:09:29.030]
I just breeze through those just a joke when you relax Jesus God are you uptight and out of sight

[02:09:30.410 --> 02:09:36.670]
Uh 1.8 million clear channel Afghanistan chaining next to me. I don't know if it's on there now maybe I didn't send it to you

[02:09:38.970 --> 02:09:42.650]
Or maybe it will be on there tomorrow, but whatever I said to you for tomorrow whatever the hell I did

[02:09:42.650 --> 02:09:46.070]
It's gonna be on here and I already read it and leave us alone with your freaking OJ, okay?

[02:09:46.330 --> 02:09:49.570]
Take OJ and put his head in your rectum. Okay. I'll probably already in there

[02:09:51.070 --> 02:09:51.390]
God

[02:09:52.610 --> 02:09:56.150]
So it's the same person he's faxing us that story over and over again like we don't know about him

[02:09:56.930 --> 02:10:01.210]
Let's probably my bed for trying to cancel it because you know what the fact that oh that's not a good idea

[02:10:01.610 --> 02:10:03.290]
Because they're persistent baby

[02:10:04.010 --> 02:10:08.870]
Persistence pays off and of course once they find out that you don't want it then they send it 80 million times

[02:10:09.810 --> 02:10:11.490]
What he's really trying to say is OJ?

[02:10:11.670 --> 02:10:13.790]
Kill the cold yeah if I'd done it

[02:10:14.390 --> 02:10:14.750]
if

[02:10:15.510 --> 02:10:19.130]
If chickens peed man there'd be a flood on your head OJ you stupid bastard

[02:10:19.130 --> 02:10:22.050]
Yeah, this is just another way to why what he gets we have million for this book

[02:10:22.830 --> 02:10:26.530]
Yeah, I reckon which the gold ones in the browns will get that's it but he do die

[02:10:27.250 --> 02:10:30.410]
Maybe they can get enough to make some a shoe fly pie and apple pan dowdy

[02:10:31.730 --> 02:10:36.310]
Anyway, see you got me off my off my pointed rounds here once again. I understand the method in your madness

[02:10:36.910 --> 02:10:38.490]
We have 1200 votes by the way

[02:10:39.010 --> 02:10:42.630]
Like that without even pushing his pull and also I think I put it on your body. I don't know

[02:10:43.150 --> 02:10:46.350]
I don't know what was going on with Eric yesterday because I said him the pull

[02:10:46.350 --> 02:10:51.370]
I think I thanks to him like three times and then finally around 715 he put it up there so I could swish it

[02:10:52.070 --> 02:10:55.890]
He's just getting upset because we had 1600 votes on a pull while the show was still on yesterday

[02:10:56.710 --> 02:10:58.050]
And he's jealous of that

[02:10:58.410 --> 02:11:02.110]
I think he's pissed off because we're not getting as many reads on those stories as we always did

[02:11:02.110 --> 02:11:06.850]
And that started right after the election was over. It's like oh wait. Give us a rest now. I understand that

[02:11:06.850 --> 02:11:13.490]
Can't you understand that sure? Why not whatever give us a word? Give us a breather now. Okay put on some of those really entertaining calls not

[02:11:15.330 --> 02:11:20.490]
Like that one at the end of the Kenny and Vosho this morning at the Johnny G or Joey whatever he was there was

[02:11:20.990 --> 02:11:25.750]
So you're telling us a fake caller? I don't know that just what it sounded like to me. No

[02:11:26.470 --> 02:11:30.110]
The VSO is DUI task force will be conducting saturation patrols

[02:11:30.110 --> 02:11:34.570]
This is for all you drunks out there for all yours actually. I don't know why do we do this? Why do we do this?

[02:11:34.870 --> 02:11:39.610]
Because it's a public service like you said a public service. It's an it's aiding and a betting

[02:11:40.170 --> 02:11:47.550]
No, no, drunks. What they're doing is they're doing checkpoints and pulling everybody over and destroying everyone's ability to travel about in mind their own business

[02:11:47.550 --> 02:11:49.530]
Everybody's ability to drink and drive and know

[02:11:51.130 --> 02:11:52.950]
Anyway, you've never been stuck in a checkpoint

[02:11:55.250 --> 02:12:01.090]
The VSO DUI task force will conduct saturation patrols this Saturday, November 18 from 8 30 p.m

[02:12:01.090 --> 02:12:05.750]
They'll 5 and a.m. The following morning in areas of north-awterdale Oakland Park and on a corporate central

[02:12:07.430 --> 02:12:10.910]
County impaired drivers will be identified and DUI laws will be actively in forward

[02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:16.650]
Throw your ass in a slimer and your car too and impound your house and your dog and your kids and everybody and your

[02:12:16.650 --> 02:12:18.410]
Miner bird and your cockatoo

[02:12:19.290 --> 02:12:23.670]
This information is published in compliance with a Supreme Court ruling mandate in prior announcement of selective service

[02:12:23.670 --> 02:12:27.110]
And for selective enforcement activity yada yada

[02:12:28.190 --> 02:12:31.910]
In other words, it's on there because they law requires them to do it

[02:12:31.910 --> 02:12:37.190]
Supreme Court has said you got to put on it. You can't just all of a sudden surprise, you know like here go pull over and

[02:12:37.850 --> 02:12:40.670]
Well, they're giving everybody over

[02:12:41.410 --> 02:12:46.550]
They put cones out in the road and block all the traffic and make sure that nobody gets by and they can

[02:12:46.650 --> 02:12:47.690]
Put their car in the car

[02:12:47.690 --> 02:12:50.970]
They're putting cones out in the road. They ought to put Stanley J Cohen out there. I'll take you that

[02:12:51.610 --> 02:12:55.910]
My former boss at INZ who used to drive that yellow Seville. We used to call it the Pimp Mobile

[02:12:56.850 --> 02:12:57.170]
Wow

[02:12:58.070 --> 02:13:05.190]
Nothing like a guy named Stanley J Cohen in in Opalaka no less where the station was INZ and i95 which later became Zeta out there in the middle of

[02:13:05.590 --> 02:13:07.810]
Actually, that's Carol City. Is that what I just said?

[02:13:08.330 --> 02:13:11.330]
Let's sit over lock it. Well, it's close to Opalaka. Yes, it is Carol City

[02:13:12.250 --> 02:13:17.210]
And of course Carol City ain't far from where the stadium is which is right about where you are right now right down the road

[02:13:17.210 --> 02:13:22.670]
Yeah, right by your drug dealer now and the barber shop and chuck in the sub center and of course the the

[02:13:22.670 --> 02:13:23.570]
diner

[02:13:24.450 --> 02:13:27.010]
The stadium diners now what that's called. Yes

[02:13:29.010 --> 02:13:32.050]
Remember we got those omelets from the stadium diner that time

[02:13:32.910 --> 02:13:34.190]
That one time yeah

[02:13:35.110 --> 02:13:40.670]
Joshua Holland writes on the smirking chimp public school teacher gives lesson in right wing Christian tolerance

[02:13:42.450 --> 02:13:42.850]
Oh

[02:13:42.850 --> 02:13:46.450]
Boy that one that was depressing that's story about the exchange student from Poland

[02:13:46.850 --> 02:13:50.210]
He got a lovely pressing huh he got off lucky a

[02:13:51.410 --> 02:13:56.410]
History teacher at the local public high school in kerning new jersey may have bitten off more than he cares to chew this fall

[02:13:56.410 --> 02:14:05.130]
Self-described conservative Baptist David Pasquitz used his history class to proselytize biblical fundamentalism over the course of several days at the beginning of this school year

[02:14:06.070 --> 02:14:09.910]
Among his remarks in open class were statements that a being must have created the universe

[02:14:09.910 --> 02:14:15.490]
That the Christian Bible is the word of God and the dinosaurs were aboard Noah's Ark if you do not accept Jesus

[02:14:15.490 --> 02:14:19.030]
He flatly per came to his class you belong in a hill all right

[02:14:20.170 --> 02:14:21.590]
This is a public school teacher

[02:14:22.570 --> 02:14:26.770]
Referring to a Muslim student who had been mentioned by a name. He lamented what he saw as her inevitable fate

[02:14:26.770 --> 02:14:29.890]
Should she not convert and an attempt to promote biblical creationism

[02:14:29.890 --> 02:14:37.510]
He also dismissed evolution in the big bang is non-scientific arguing by contrast that the Bible is supported by what he calls confirmed biblical prophecies

[02:14:37.510 --> 02:14:38.070]
the

[02:14:39.370 --> 02:14:43.410]
After taking the matter of the school administration wanted Pasquitz students junior Matthew LeClair

[02:14:43.830 --> 02:14:46.690]
requested a meeting with the teacher and the school principal you go and Matt

[02:14:47.750 --> 02:14:54.030]
LeClair a non-Christian was requesting an apology and correction to false and anti-scientific statements after two weeks of meeting

[02:14:55.010 --> 02:14:59.650]
Meeting to place in principal's office where in Pasquitz and I'd make me any of the comments claiming that LeClair would take

[02:14:59.650 --> 02:15:04.150]
And then some of our side of context Pasquitz specifically denied using the phrase you belong in a hill

[02:15:04.150 --> 02:15:08.110]
He also asserted that nothing different in this class that he's been doing in 15 years of teaching

[02:15:08.110 --> 02:15:15.550]
Here's the sweet part at the end of the meeting with care with the chair revealed he had recorded the remarks and presented the principal with two compact discs

[02:15:15.550 --> 02:15:18.030]
Curses it says for all by modern science

[02:15:19.410 --> 02:15:22.870]
The teacher then declined to comment further without his union representative

[02:15:22.870 --> 02:15:28.710]
However, he fired one last shot of the student saying you got the big fish you got the big Christian guy who's a teacher

[02:15:30.310 --> 02:15:36.190]
This guy will certainly go down as a martyr of the ACLU's and civic political correctness and another good Christian depressed by evil secularists

[02:15:36.190 --> 02:15:41.510]
No apology has been forthcoming from the teacher or from the school the parents state that because the administration's in action

[02:15:41.510 --> 02:15:45.290]
They've taken the matter to the school board this week from whom they are waiting a response

[02:15:45.950 --> 02:15:51.510]
Apparently this Matt LeClair is a pretty cool kid last year. He made an impassioned defense of his refusal to stand for the pledge of allegiance

[02:15:51.510 --> 02:15:53.770]
Like I said you go Matt our kind of guy

[02:15:55.390 --> 02:15:57.810]
As Mark Foley would say send us a picture

[02:15:58.710 --> 02:16:03.270]
When I sit out the McCarthy era version of the pledge it is not because I don't care about respect your love my country

[02:16:03.270 --> 02:16:08.290]
He said just the opposite is because I do our country is taking many dangerous turns lately

[02:16:08.290 --> 02:16:14.210]
We've given away many of our freedoms through the so-called pay-punct radical elements threaten to turn our democracy into a theocracy

[02:16:14.210 --> 02:16:17.590]
Groups the majority doesn't understand like homosexual intellectuals and liberals

[02:16:17.590 --> 02:16:21.290]
I regularly treated with scorn contempt and disrespect. Hey, Matt you're fairy

[02:16:21.290 --> 02:16:24.910]
I don't sit because standing is too hard because we sit in the plant takes too long

[02:16:24.910 --> 02:16:30.210]
Would be much easier to stand and not have people telling me I'm on patriotic a communist where I'm spitting on America

[02:16:30.690 --> 02:16:37.350]
Most of these comments haven't been made by students but teachers and staff members the adults who are supposed to be teaching a citizenship

[02:16:37.930 --> 02:16:44.110]
Standing would be a small act indeed sitting is the big one nice going Matt. How do you like that? Great him for president

[02:16:45.730 --> 02:16:46.950]
It says in this story

[02:16:46.950 --> 02:16:53.870]
PS one or more of you just read on some right-wing blog about a Muslim school teacher in tesh Kent who told his class something equally offensive

[02:16:53.870 --> 02:16:58.230]
You're about to write the comments that my fate or to cover that important story proves once and for all that

[02:16:58.230 --> 02:16:59.850]
I'm hateful and abuses toward all Christians

[02:16:59.850 --> 02:17:04.530]
Despite the fact that mr. Paschal which is clearly a nut job who represents the tiny minority thereof

[02:17:05.030 --> 02:17:07.750]
Don't do it. Why? Because I don't live in whose veckas stand

[02:17:07.750 --> 02:17:12.490]
I don't pay taxes in whose veckas stand nor what I said my children do and as was veckas standing school if I had any

[02:17:12.490 --> 02:17:16.630]
I have no clue whether to use veckas standing constitution guarantees the separation of church in state

[02:17:16.630 --> 02:17:20.510]
But ours does on a very fundamental level. I don't care what people say in tesh Kent

[02:17:22.070 --> 02:17:26.210]
I'm not the AP or royalties and make no claim to covering everything that you might find interesting only what I do

[02:17:26.210 --> 02:17:30.790]
And if you see a story about a Muslim teacher in an American public school trying to similarly indoctrinate his or her students

[02:17:30.790 --> 02:17:36.250]
email it to me now guarantee I'll receive the news with equal offense and snarky a program. How do you like that?

[02:17:36.310 --> 02:17:41.490]

This story just makes me want to do a number one two three and four right on the floor

[02:21:01.310 --> 02:21:06.670]
Fox News reporter is freed for two million dollars terrorists to use cash for arms to hit Zionist

[02:21:06.670 --> 02:21:08.530]
Payment said to encourage more abductions

[02:21:10.590 --> 02:21:14.030]
Great Fox News helping wherever they can no no

[02:21:15.950 --> 02:21:20.550]
Palastinian terror groups and security organizations in the Gaza strip received two million dollars from the US

[02:21:21.830 --> 02:21:23.770]
Inext from a US source

[02:21:24.550 --> 02:21:26.650]
In exchange for the release of Fox News employees

[02:21:26.650 --> 02:21:35.050]
Steve Centani and Olaf Wig who were kidnapped last summer in Jerusalem a senior leader one of the groups suspected the abductions told world news

[02:21:35.050 --> 02:21:36.330]
A daily world net daily

[02:21:37.230 --> 02:21:42.770]
They terribly different the Gaza based popular resistance committee said his organization share the money was used to purchase weapons

[02:21:42.770 --> 02:21:45.650]
Which he said will be utilized to hit designers

[02:21:46.430 --> 02:21:52.090]
He said he expects the payments for Centani and Wig street and will encourage Palestinian groups to carry out further kidnappings

[02:21:53.410 --> 02:21:58.830]
Officials associated with Palestinian authority president Mahmoud Abbas's fatakh party and its security organization

[02:21:58.830 --> 02:22:04.210]
The preventative security forces confirmed to WND money was paid for the release of the Fox News reporters

[02:22:05.110 --> 02:22:12.350]
A senior leader of the Al-Aksa martyrs brigade terror group the declared military wing of a top said the group received a small percentage of the two million dollars

[02:22:12.350 --> 02:22:14.770]
Which all parties interviewed said was transferred in cash

[02:22:16.250 --> 02:22:20.930]
Centani and Wig were released last August after being held hostage by a terrorist in Gaza for nearly two weeks

[02:22:20.930 --> 02:22:26.310]
Surely before the release of it was issued showing the two arrested beige Arab-style robes and appearing to convert to Islam

[02:22:26.910 --> 02:22:31.170]
Wig in his illan citizen gave an anti-western speech with his face expressionless

[02:22:31.730 --> 02:22:34.890]
Centani later explained he and Wig were forced to convert to Islam at gunpoint

[02:22:34.890 --> 02:22:43.050]
One week after the abduction WND broke a story a cland from the Gaza strip which leads to the terror cells of the popular resistance committees were promised suspects in the kidnappings

Canunis and Gaza City they said they have evidence the clan was heavily involved and it goes on but a beep but a boop but a bop and

[02:22:56.770 --> 02:23:01.810]
Two million dollars in cash was transferred to the preventative security services, but we still don't know what where it came from

[02:23:03.590 --> 02:23:07.990]
You don't think it could be from Rupert Murdoch do you and anybody at Fox News, huh?

[02:23:07.990 --> 02:23:13.610]
Hmm to get their people out so that the terror because I thought we didn't negotiate with

Kidnappers and terrorists isn't that the old saw that we're always hearing about oh the old way, but what's will not saw people you know

[02:23:22.090 --> 02:23:23.830]

[02:23:56.490 --> 02:24:01.830]
Staff statement by prison representative the part of the camp where Abramoff will be kept always going to be held in camp good

[02:24:02.430 --> 02:24:08.510]
Is a 334 bed minimum security facility located in Iran industrial park along north branch of the Potomac River

[02:24:10.270 --> 02:24:13.790]
Abramoff to the Guilty and January and lying to lying on financial statements and

[02:24:13.790 --> 02:24:17.690]
Creating phony documents to persuade lenders to back a bid for some crews

[02:24:17.690 --> 02:24:23.830]
Abramoff has been cooperating with prosecutors in a wide ranging justice department inquiry of bribery and influence peddling in the federal government

[02:24:24.470 --> 02:24:29.670]
He could hold a key to a sweeping corruption case involving Congress members of the Bush administration and their aides

[02:24:29.670 --> 02:24:33.790]
And prosecutors had put in their starwaters behind bars would impede the investigation

[02:24:34.410 --> 02:24:38.850]
But a Miami federal judge refused to delay the sentence many Abramoff's cooperation will have to continue from prison

[02:24:38.850 --> 02:24:42.070]
Where he'll be inmate number yadi yadi his lawyers had no comment

[02:24:42.930 --> 02:24:45.670]
Got his inmates number on here if you want to communicate with him no

[02:24:47.090 --> 02:24:50.250]
Oh, I'm good. Thanks. Are you good? Yeah

[02:24:50.810 --> 02:24:55.470]
Josh is going to watch max point tonight and give us a report to our it's like doing a book report for school, you know

[02:24:56.450 --> 02:25:01.550]
I watched the American dad last night and I thought it was just fine. It was a funny as long as it was great. Mm-hmm. It took a chest

[02:25:03.350 --> 02:25:07.290]
Stuff that needs to be said right and this and you know, I thought it was only me

[02:25:07.290 --> 02:25:11.450]
You know, I'm sure not only me, but this thing would log cabin Republicans. It's like news for Jesus

[02:25:11.450 --> 02:25:16.130]
You know, it's like blacks for the clan. It just doesn't make any sense by favorite people with a death wish

[02:25:16.130 --> 02:25:18.810]
Did you like his little play his Abraham Lincoln play? Yeah

[02:25:18.810 --> 02:25:22.850]
And how come he blinking got involved now? Yeah, oh, yeah, that was cute

[02:25:24.210 --> 02:25:26.810]
Lot of deep significance in that thing. It's really deep. Mm-hmm

[02:25:27.890 --> 02:25:32.390]
Kind of like what's going on a QA him. It's very very deep and I wish you'd quit picking on poor Kenny

[02:25:39.890 --> 02:25:40.610]
Not personal

[02:25:41.330 --> 02:25:45.830]
It's not picking on him. I would like to see him do the kind of show that I know he wants to do

[02:25:46.350 --> 02:25:48.330]
Yeah, and everyone's a that you would listen to

[02:25:49.430 --> 02:25:52.890]
Or anybody else for that matter. It's more important that other people want to listen to it. Oh, no

[02:25:52.890 --> 02:25:56.870]
You're thinking a sparing person. Yeah, it's business and I think somebody's gonna be taking a personal

[02:25:56.870 --> 02:25:59.290]
And then you know what's gonna happen if they fail

[02:25:59.810 --> 02:26:04.450]
Because of your negativity. I'm not what it's gonna take the money. Oh that Neil he makes sure everybody else fails

[02:26:04.450 --> 02:26:08.490]
You know he wouldn't support Chuck Meyer in that great morning show on i.o. D in uh, yeah

[02:26:09.270 --> 02:26:11.290]
No, support the music on Zeta right

[02:26:13.470 --> 02:26:16.730]
I hope everybody on the station gets double digit numbers in the ratings

[02:26:16.730 --> 02:26:23.410]
Because it makes more money for us. I mean, what would you rather be would you rather be like I'm a Titanic and trying to hang on for dear life

[02:26:23.410 --> 02:26:26.710]
Or would you rather be like on you know some luxury cruise ship that's like

[02:26:27.170 --> 02:26:32.330]
Save them along with us everybody's gonna happy song. I want all to have a hundred share. There you go

[02:26:33.270 --> 02:26:35.370]
All day every day all day

[02:26:35.930 --> 02:26:39.150]
That's like woodbinds open and you realize that the slots at Gulfstream

[02:26:39.150 --> 02:26:41.250]
I believe if we had a report of there we would know for sure

[02:26:41.250 --> 02:26:43.490]
But if we had any buddy fax the same thing

[02:26:43.490 --> 02:26:47.150]
No, probably take a collar to on it, but i'm sure we won't get any

[02:26:48.090 --> 02:26:53.770]
And i don't want i don't want to go there you know i'm saying i don't want to have to be that desperate to open up and start taking calls to find out what to deal

[02:26:53.770 --> 02:26:58.390]
But they've been open an hour and a half almost and the world is still spinning the sun is shining here

[02:26:59.810 --> 02:27:01.450]
How about the sun is shining there?

[02:27:02.210 --> 02:27:03.510]
Yes somewhere somewhere

[02:27:04.130 --> 02:27:10.250]
Yeah, and the birds are still and look at that it's a 48 degrees here already. It's gonna be 50 how do you like that?

[02:27:10.250 --> 02:27:16.610]
Mm-hmm that toasty it is and there's a little bit of sunshine for the first time in days there's actually the sun is up there

[02:27:17.990 --> 02:27:19.530]
You know what's gonna happen on friday

[02:27:20.750 --> 02:27:26.730]
Well, we're gonna get some ice cream and um maybe some weenies right what do you mean maybe some weenies well i don't know

[02:27:26.730 --> 02:27:28.970]
Yes, stop crannies

[02:27:31.170 --> 02:27:37.150]
This is 2020 George the Republicans had their ass-handed to the turn the election

[02:27:37.790 --> 02:27:43.490]
Here's a recording of what dick said during his campaign the president of the united states is dishonest

[02:27:43.490 --> 02:27:46.070]
President of the united states purposely

[02:27:46.070 --> 02:27:49.990]
This led the american people. What do you think about that dick channey

[02:27:49.990 --> 02:27:52.070]
Man and a faithful Muslim

[02:27:52.590 --> 02:27:58.710]
Well, George we got a surprise for you here's dick channey himself from George dick. What do you do with that?

[02:27:58.750 --> 02:28:00.450]
Baby girl dick channey's and ass

[02:28:01.150 --> 02:28:02.830]
You do it George

[02:28:02.830 --> 02:28:04.690]
I don't want to do you with it. Are you crazy?

[02:28:05.010 --> 02:28:07.910]
I'm the guy who pulled a crazy shot the president of the united states

[02:28:07.910 --> 02:28:09.670]
I went there dick channey can

[02:28:10.630 --> 02:28:11.950]
Tonight on 2020

[02:28:12.710 --> 02:28:16.950]
All right 131 at 560 some really interesting editing in that bin I know this

[02:28:16.950 --> 02:28:21.470]
Mm-hmm. I didn't do that. I'm a reporter that wasn't what am I I know

[02:28:22.790 --> 02:28:26.110]
232 votes. What do you mean by that? I thought it was just fine. It's just uh, you know

[02:28:26.110 --> 02:28:30.290]
A little hot a little bit of the blur in the exercises. I thought it was on been around like a drill

[02:28:30.930 --> 02:28:34.530]
Ed fully the father of former representative markfully died last night

[02:28:35.550 --> 02:28:38.190]
How do you like that? Well, I don't

[02:28:38.190 --> 02:28:41.550]
The cause isn't known yet, but Ed fully was diagnosed with cancer in 2004

[02:28:41.550 --> 02:28:47.350]
Mark fully let's see. He's still said to be in a rehab facility in Arizona undergoing treatment for alcohol and behavior

[02:28:47.350 --> 02:28:51.910]
Relish you fairy in 2004 when fully dropped out of the race for US Senate

[02:28:53.210 --> 02:28:57.770]
He cited is father's recent cancer diagnosis as the reason he's always been there for me

[02:28:57.770 --> 02:29:00.710]
I have to be there for him fully said at the time and now he's in rehab

[02:29:01.350 --> 02:29:02.030]
Miss fully

[02:29:03.230 --> 02:29:04.830]
As we turn another page

[02:29:05.370 --> 02:29:09.010]
In the history of the in the tragic history of the fully family I guess

[02:29:09.870 --> 02:29:13.350]
That bad then bad taste turning another page. What a over

[02:29:14.570 --> 02:29:18.890]
From 132 votes we could have made 13 today easy, but why to help put a lot of fresh Iran, huh? That's right

[02:29:18.890 --> 02:29:21.370]
Just ease into what man ease into what he's out of it

[02:29:24.370 --> 02:29:29.430]
Senator Jew Lieberman the now independent Democrat from Connecticut could be the most powerful member of the US Senate

[02:29:29.430 --> 02:29:31.650]
According to a front page article that was in today's

[02:29:32.490 --> 02:29:33.770]
Edition of the New York Times

[02:29:34.630 --> 02:29:38.910]
It's hard to imagine how Lieberman could have emerged better from last week selection wrote Mark Liebervich

[02:29:39.390 --> 02:29:41.670]
It was reelected comfortably in the Democratic party

[02:29:41.670 --> 02:29:48.310]
He still belongs to is now the majority if that majority is slim enough to turn Lieberman into arguably the Senate's most influential member

[02:29:49.490 --> 02:29:53.970]
You know anybody out there's got an influential member. I've actually that Brady Quinn's got an influential member

[02:29:55.370 --> 02:30:00.330]
Leave of its notes that if Lieberman relieved the Democratic party this end would effectively be under Republican control because

[02:30:00.330 --> 02:30:04.770]
Under constitution rules vice president Dick Cheney gets to cast tie breaking votes

[02:30:06.210 --> 02:30:10.510]
It was very painful for him to have all these people he thought were his friends and braces opponent

[02:30:10.510 --> 02:30:14.710]
Winnie equally Winnie GOP Senator Susan Collins is quoted as saying

[02:30:15.830 --> 02:30:18.890]
Kines Moss Winnie Susan Collins or Jew Lieberman

[02:30:19.430 --> 02:30:24.310]
Now not only is he reelected resoundingly, but he's also the key to which party controls the Senate she was Winnie

[02:30:25.290 --> 02:30:28.930]
But we ever find are they I think they're in a nonstop spot

[02:30:30.110 --> 02:30:35.250]
On MSNBC. I don't think they're ever going to go or am I on sadness? I don't know where I'm out. I want to see if redesign your girlfriend

[02:30:44.330 --> 02:30:44.690]
Timing

[02:30:45.270 --> 02:30:51.290]
About the supporters unknown untested and unfamiliar Democratic challenger netta Lamont received from the senators parties allies

[02:30:51.290 --> 02:30:54.530]
Well the reason that Lamont got this for is that he isn't Jew Lieberman

[02:30:55.510 --> 02:30:56.730]
He's not a turncoat

[02:30:57.710 --> 02:31:00.090]
He's not a storage bush looking

[02:31:00.810 --> 02:31:03.690]
Right wing is real firster lunatic

[02:31:05.230 --> 02:31:10.670]
I would say that Jew Lieberman is the Wolf Blitzkrieg of politics and the Wolf Blitzkrieg is the Jew Lieberman of so-called journalism

[02:31:10.670 --> 02:31:11.910]
I use the term very loosely

[02:31:13.790 --> 02:31:16.650]
Despite being disappointed with Karl Roe's election performance

[02:31:17.650 --> 02:31:21.390]
President Bush is agreed to keep his chief political advisor for the remainder of his administration

[02:31:21.390 --> 02:31:25.450]
administration sources said Mr. Oversaut to stay with Bush until the end of his presidency

[02:31:26.170 --> 02:31:31.430]
The sources said despite pressure on the president to be shuffle his staff for next year Mr. Bush wants Mr. Roe

[02:31:31.430 --> 02:31:32.710]
by his side

[02:31:33.290 --> 02:31:34.990]
He knows too much source said

[02:31:35.690 --> 02:31:39.890]
The last thing the president wants is another published memoir and book tour of life inside the White House

[02:31:39.890 --> 02:31:41.790]
Wouldn't that be sweet I'd buy that one

[02:31:43.210 --> 02:31:46.750]
The sources said Mr. Bush was unhappy with the failure of Roe's election strategy

[02:31:46.750 --> 02:31:48.730]
Which focused on national security

[02:31:48.730 --> 02:31:52.270]
It said the GOP defeat would probably lead to a different relationship between the two men

[02:31:54.290 --> 02:31:58.310]
For his part the president appeared to blame Roe for the Republican Party's election strategy

[02:31:58.310 --> 02:32:01.650]
Based on the notion that there would be no significant swing vote

[02:32:02.210 --> 02:32:04.950]
In a jocular tone that accompanied a steely gaze

[02:32:04.950 --> 02:32:09.450]
Bush portrayed himself as working the campaign circuit while Roe sat in the White House strategizing

[02:32:10.370 --> 02:32:13.690]
I obviously was working harder in the campaign than he was Bush said a roe

[02:32:14.670 --> 02:32:18.110]
Would have stupid as a dumbbell laugh when I grin

[02:32:18.770 --> 02:32:22.510]
The sources said Mr. Roe would be the exception to plans for an overall administration shakeup

[02:32:22.510 --> 02:32:27.730]
They said the resignation of defense secretary Dom Marumsel to launch a wave of departures from the White House

[02:32:27.730 --> 02:32:30.710]
As part of an effort to ensure cooperation with the Democratic-led Congress

[02:32:30.710 --> 02:32:32.930]
The goal here is survival of GOP strategists

[02:32:33.570 --> 02:32:35.590]
It's kind of like us here at QA and the goal of survival

[02:32:36.910 --> 02:32:43.430]
And now that we got Greg Reed back into building with his zoot suit on all the time over to our pound 96 allegedly going to straighten their act out

[02:32:43.990 --> 02:32:47.130]
Maybe get some of that rigatoning music off the air that Tanner is killing him with

[02:32:48.590 --> 02:32:56.050]
Can you believe that talk about a bad penny what did they say about a bad penny always showing back? Yeah, no something like that

[02:32:57.330 --> 02:33:00.810]
As a result the president of vision's cooperation with the Democratic-controlled Congress

[02:33:00.810 --> 02:33:07.590]
In addition such as Iraq and immigration the sources said the administration domestic agenda highlighted by social security reform and tax cuts would be

[02:33:07.590 --> 02:33:13.110]
Sheld as the Democrats seek to reverse the achievements of the outgoing GOP like the achievements my ass

[02:33:13.110 --> 02:33:20.330]
I think this ends 26 years of hard-right conservative said senator Joe Biden to Delaware referring to last week's election

[02:33:20.330 --> 02:33:26.770]
He's also I think they closed the book on that to which we say all right. Thanks God

[02:33:27.410 --> 02:33:30.770]
Close the book on a baby. I'll close it too hard it might bleed

[02:33:32.630 --> 02:33:33.950]
1241 votes on the pool

[02:33:34.950 --> 02:33:36.030]
Let's see how they're doing

[02:33:36.570 --> 02:33:41.990]
Which religious group is the most malignant born again Christians 596 almost half 48%

[02:33:43.070 --> 02:33:47.790]
I think we're alienating the born again Christians just like you're alienating our good friends in the morning show there

[02:33:49.310 --> 02:33:49.790]
G

[02:33:50.450 --> 02:33:53.390]
Born again Christians 596 Muslims 316

[02:33:53.390 --> 02:34:00.510]
But that's not even close not even close the born again. They got almost half of the votes and the Muslims only a little over quarter 25.4%

[02:34:01.650 --> 02:34:05.410]
Scientologists about 105 which I think that's more than they're actually our Scientologists

[02:34:07.170 --> 02:34:11.190]
How many how many members do you think they have worldwide a worldwide?

[02:34:11.690 --> 02:34:18.190]
I know third man million. I hate this pull 94 7 and a half percent which we take great umbridge and

[02:34:18.190 --> 02:34:20.290]
We're pretty piot about that not

[02:34:20.950 --> 02:34:28.630]
Catholic 66 just edging out narrowly orthodox Jews with the big hats and the tephilin and the long beards and all the schmothas on

[02:34:28.630 --> 02:34:31.790]
64 for the orthodox Jews the real ultra far-bison

[02:34:32.310 --> 02:34:36.230]
Out of 1243 votes not too shabby not bad not spectacular

[02:34:36.750 --> 02:34:40.710]
But like I said, I think I think now in the holidays are here. Of course everybody's out shopping

[02:34:41.390 --> 02:34:47.230]
Am I right? Oh, yeah, don't we like moving to a different gear now from from this point to the end of the year till after New Year right high gear

[02:34:49.530 --> 02:34:50.950]
We're into a different gear

[02:34:51.710 --> 02:34:56.990]
And I think basically the good philosophy like you said a little while ago is we'll just show up when we feel like it is the mood strikes us, you know

[02:34:58.390 --> 02:35:03.890]
If we feel like we're obligated to be here on a given day then we'll all show up if not maybe one or two of us won't show up

[02:35:03.890 --> 02:35:08.950]
And then if none of us you know if we happen to get up on you know like our buyer rhythms are all the same on a given day nobody shows up

[02:35:10.490 --> 02:35:16.330]
And then then they can stick an eye sports show in there from 10 to 2 for a while right like they want to and then clearance will say

[02:35:16.330 --> 02:35:19.350]
Wow did you hear that that was really great now that fag talk

[02:35:20.810 --> 02:35:21.910]
I got news for a man

[02:35:21.910 --> 02:35:24.390]
I know more about Brady Quinn and all your sports people put together

[02:35:24.390 --> 02:35:29.530]
Okay, he could play on my team and the fact that I'm rooting for Notre Dame when I see them play that that is disgusting

[02:35:30.570 --> 02:35:36.730]
Just like me rooting for michigan when Tom Brady was playing it and that is disgusting as a Spartan from Michigan state

[02:35:37.910 --> 02:35:40.450]
Even though I think I attended about eight classes there, but nevertheless

[02:35:40.450 --> 02:35:50.310]
To be rooting for teams just because they got a real hot quarterback that is the ultimate in fagory and I confess to it readily and enthusiastically and very happily

[02:35:50.990 --> 02:35:53.450]
You know I'm saying what he said. I don't care

[02:35:54.750 --> 02:35:59.390]
Love Notre Dame maybe what what's how does that fight song go Notre Dame fight song Josh how's that go

[02:35:59.390 --> 02:36:02.030]
Thank you

[02:36:05.190 --> 02:36:09.690]
Very good George is a big good name fan the fighting area touchdown Jesus

[02:36:11.630 --> 02:36:22.910]

[02:36:29.390 --> 02:36:31.450]

[02:36:57.230 --> 02:36:58.910]
It makes me feel alright.

[02:36:59.590 --> 02:37:00.170]
Alright.

And then I drop to more.

[02:37:11.750 --> 02:37:17.690]
Oh my daddy, he wants to meet a newbie hardworking man.

[02:37:18.430 --> 02:37:23.570]
And my mother, he wants to meet a newbie as you can.

[02:37:24.830 --> 02:37:29.670]
The same one day I met him, I came for me and said,

[02:37:29.950 --> 02:37:33.730]
You're fair, hard work, good and hard work, fine.

[02:37:33.730 --> 02:37:36.010]
But first take care of him.

[02:37:36.390 --> 02:37:39.750]
So now I hope to join when I get up.

[02:37:40.170 --> 02:37:42.070]
In the car I hope to join.

[02:37:43.150 --> 02:37:46.230]
I hope to join when I play video game.

[02:37:46.690 --> 02:37:49.450]
And at every 10,000 boys I hope to join.

[02:37:49.810 --> 02:37:52.510]
I hope to join this time of week.

[02:37:53.050 --> 02:37:54.770]
And do it time of war.

[02:37:56.050 --> 02:37:58.510]
I hope to join before I come to join.

[02:37:59.190 --> 02:38:00.810]
And then I hope to more.

[02:38:26.050 --> 02:38:32.370]
Oh my daddy, he wants to meet a newbie hardworking man.

[02:38:32.370 --> 02:38:38.610]
And my mother, he wants to meet a newbie as you can.

[02:38:39.850 --> 02:38:44.590]
The same one day I met him, I came for me and said,

[02:38:44.970 --> 02:38:48.610]
You're fair, hard work, good and hard work, fine.

[02:38:49.310 --> 02:38:50.930]
But first take care of him.

[02:38:51.310 --> 02:38:54.390]
That's why I hope to join in the morning.

[02:38:55.010 --> 02:38:56.890]
I hope to join tonight.

[02:38:57.910 --> 02:39:00.750]
I hope to join in the afternoon.

[02:39:00.750 --> 02:39:03.190]
It makes me feel alright.

[02:39:03.450 --> 02:39:03.770]
Oh right.

[02:39:04.790 --> 02:39:07.470]
I hope to join this time of week.

[02:39:07.890 --> 02:39:09.610]
And do it time of war.

[02:39:10.830 --> 02:39:13.370]
I hope to join before I come to join.

[02:39:13.910 --> 02:39:15.670]
And then I hope to more.

[02:39:16.250 --> 02:39:17.570]
Oh, to join.

[02:39:17.830 --> 02:39:18.610]
That's what I do.

[02:39:22.330 --> 02:39:23.850]
Oh, to join.

[02:39:24.050 --> 02:39:27.430]
So then hope to join with me at any morning.

[02:39:28.710 --> 02:39:30.070]
Oh, to join.

[02:39:30.310 --> 02:39:33.770]
So then hope to join with me at noon.

[02:39:34.570 --> 02:39:34.570]

[02:39:35.010 --> 02:39:36.410]
Oh, to join.

[02:39:36.530 --> 02:39:38.230]
Hey, what's your father and love to join?

[02:39:38.350 --> 02:39:40.610]
So we'll bother you or home or home.

[02:39:41.210 --> 02:39:42.630]
Oh, to join.

[02:39:42.870 --> 02:39:44.010]
I know you want to say that.

[02:39:47.270 --> 02:39:48.830]
Oh, to join.

[02:39:54.430 --> 02:39:55.230]
Oh, to join.

[02:39:55.970 --> 02:39:57.710]
Oh, to join.

[02:40:01.710 --> 02:40:05.050]
148 at 560 WQM just minutes away from the Jim Mandacho.

[02:40:05.590 --> 02:40:06.570]
Mr. Mad Dog at two.

[02:40:06.770 --> 02:40:09.690]
And then of course, Mr. Mad Dog and Mr. Humber at four to five

[02:40:09.690 --> 02:40:11.510]
with the power hour, hang from five to seven.

[02:40:11.590 --> 02:40:13.350]
Then we got a bunch of hurricanes to.

[02:40:14.050 --> 02:40:15.370]
Craig Mesh is in for Eddie K.

[02:40:15.370 --> 02:40:18.870]
It's in a clock tonight with a little Mishmash because Eddie K is not a way to Vegas.

[02:40:19.890 --> 02:40:20.670]
And he liked that.

[02:40:20.730 --> 02:40:21.130]
What a deal.

[02:40:22.570 --> 02:40:24.370]
Can you see me doing my show from Vegas?

[02:40:24.650 --> 02:40:24.930]
Why not?

[02:40:25.270 --> 02:40:25.770]
Let's do that.

[02:40:26.110 --> 02:40:27.650]
How about when I do my show from Woodbind, Mon?

[02:40:28.390 --> 02:40:28.610]
Right.

[02:40:28.810 --> 02:40:29.610]
I'm my favorite machine.

[02:40:29.810 --> 02:40:31.350]
I don't think so.

[02:40:32.250 --> 02:40:37.930]
A former telemarketers agreed to plead guilty neighbor public and phone jamming plot against new hamster Democrats four years ago.

[02:40:38.830 --> 02:40:39.590]
Sean Hanson.

[02:40:39.670 --> 02:40:41.370]
I wonder if he was one of the Hansons.

[02:40:42.110 --> 02:40:43.290]
I don't you dare.

[02:40:43.290 --> 02:40:44.270]
Who do you even think about?

[02:40:44.290 --> 02:40:44.810]
Don't write up.

[02:40:45.630 --> 02:40:45.990]
Don't.

[02:40:45.990 --> 02:40:46.650]
Don't do it.

[02:40:46.690 --> 02:40:48.230]
I can't say either.

[02:40:49.170 --> 02:40:49.270]
I'll read it.

[02:40:49.270 --> 02:40:49.830]
Sean Hanson faces.

[02:40:50.050 --> 02:40:54.170]
I told you there was one good song they had when he was like pounded on the piano and I remember the video and it was pretty good.

[02:40:54.370 --> 02:40:55.170]
You make me find it now.

[02:40:55.890 --> 02:40:56.650]
You don't have it.

[02:40:56.850 --> 02:40:57.930]
You already told me you ain't got it.

[02:40:59.310 --> 02:41:01.710]
Sean and I'm the audience is very grateful that you ain't got it.

[02:41:02.030 --> 02:41:06.670]
Sean Hanson faces two federal council conspiracy to commit interstate telephone harassment in a deal with prosecutor.

[02:41:06.670 --> 02:41:08.070]
There's no sentencing they was posted.

[02:41:09.450 --> 02:41:12.010]
In 2002, Hanson owed my low enterprises.

[02:41:12.010 --> 02:41:14.890]
I wonder if that's kin with my low Hamilton, the baseball announcer.

[02:41:15.450 --> 02:41:25.930]
And I know hotel marketing company prosecutor say we see $2,500 to place hundreds of hang up telephone calls to Democratic get out the vote phone banks and a ride to the pool line run by Manchester's firefighters union.

[02:41:27.150 --> 02:41:29.690]
Three former Republican officials were convicted in the phone jamming plot.

[02:41:30.090 --> 02:41:37.150]
Former state Republican committee executive director Chuck McGee, served seven months in federal prison after admitting to devising the scheme.

[02:41:37.510 --> 02:41:38.170]
He devised it.

[02:41:38.310 --> 02:41:38.730]
Did it.

[02:41:40.370 --> 02:41:43.230]
Chuck McGee, I wonder if he was kind of Frank McGee used to be on NBC news.

[02:41:43.350 --> 02:41:44.630]
Remember him with the glasses Frank McGee?

[02:41:44.850 --> 02:41:45.530]
Of course you know, no.

[02:41:45.870 --> 02:41:48.830]
He was on the, you know, he died before you were like born.

[02:41:49.630 --> 02:41:50.250]
Frank McGee.

[02:41:50.610 --> 02:41:52.610]
I wonder if he was kind of fibromy gay.

[02:41:52.910 --> 02:41:53.070]
Who?

[02:41:54.490 --> 02:41:55.130]
1260, 1260.

[02:41:55.230 --> 02:41:57.370]
There it is again, WAMLM and Albie Michigan.

[02:41:57.510 --> 02:41:58.490]
Maybe I'll go to Albion.

[02:41:58.650 --> 02:42:00.530]
Maybe I'll go back there to close out my career.

[02:42:01.470 --> 02:42:01.990]
Wouldn't that be great?

[02:42:02.510 --> 02:42:02.610]
What?

[02:42:03.330 --> 02:42:04.590]
Right back where you started from?

[02:42:05.030 --> 02:42:05.870]
I didn't start there.

[02:42:05.870 --> 02:42:07.730]
I started in Batavia, New York, Mr. W.

[02:42:07.930 --> 02:42:08.030]
Batavia.

[02:42:08.150 --> 02:42:08.890]
That's where you're going.

[02:42:09.530 --> 02:42:10.710]
I think I should go back there.

[02:42:10.830 --> 02:42:11.070]
Uh-huh.

[02:42:11.450 --> 02:42:12.930]
Go to the track, Batavia Downs.

[02:42:16.030 --> 02:42:19.330]
Pope John Paul the Tooth on a fast track to St. Hood.

[02:42:19.750 --> 02:42:20.890]
Oh my gosh.

[02:42:21.170 --> 02:42:25.150]
This is just, I don't know, one of those where you don't know what it will laugh or cry, you know.

[02:42:26.550 --> 02:42:31.830]
All of the Catholics are just barely edging out the Orthodox Jews on our Malignant Pool.

[02:42:32.450 --> 02:42:39.150]
Like I said, a lot of this audience is going to overlook many, many years of butchering and molesting and all those things, you know.

[02:42:39.150 --> 02:42:39.270]
Sure.

[02:42:39.770 --> 02:42:40.470]
Small potatoes.

[02:42:40.810 --> 02:42:41.170]
That's right.

[02:42:42.710 --> 02:42:46.190]
The Vatican could soon be stowed, say to what is it again?

[02:42:46.370 --> 02:42:50.830]
He could soon be stowed, say to the Pope John Paul the Tooth, the Slab on a slab.

[02:42:51.670 --> 02:42:54.450]
The late part of his believed to have had a hand in two divine interventions,

[02:42:54.850 --> 02:42:57.310]
led to the miraculous recoveries of terminal ill-patients.

[02:42:57.410 --> 02:42:58.230]
Oh, right.

[02:42:59.090 --> 02:42:59.450]
Wow.

[02:42:59.450 --> 02:43:01.490]
He heals the sick.

[02:43:03.030 --> 02:43:10.270]
The Vatican is currently investigating claims made earlier this month that a man was miraculously cured of lung cancer that doctors said was beyond remedy.

[02:43:11.510 --> 02:43:16.810]
The man's wife attributes the recovery to an intercession by Pope Paul John Paul the Tooth who died in April of last year.

[02:43:17.270 --> 02:43:25.590]
The apparently wondrous healing of Nicola Grippov, Solerno Italy, is not the first posthumous miracle attributed to Carol Joseph Wajscilla, the former Polar's Pope.

[02:43:27.310 --> 02:43:34.550]
Following a second miracle assigned to the Pope earlier this year, the development could help to fast track John Paul Tooth's path to Saint John.

[02:43:37.790 --> 02:43:47.990]
It reminds me of, it's like the British with all these nightings of Sir John and Sir Propriatured and Sir Alessandro Pratt.

[02:43:48.410 --> 02:43:54.990]
Sir Paul Pratt.

[02:43:56.030 --> 02:43:59.950]
The Vatican's congregation for the causes of saints casually known as the Saint Factory.

[02:44:00.950 --> 02:44:07.350]
It's also looking to claim that John Paul the Tooth interceded on behalf of a French nun who was incapacitated by Parkinson's disease.

[02:44:07.750 --> 02:44:12.570]
Oh, where is he now that we need to have Michael Z. Fox and Rush Limbaugh need him, straight in that problem out, that debate.

[02:44:13.490 --> 02:44:19.070]
After members of our community prayed for the intercession of the deceased Pope who during his lifetime, it suffered from the same degenerative disease.

[02:44:19.470 --> 02:44:22.030]
The elderly woman experienced a complete lasting recovery.

[02:44:22.030 --> 02:44:25.290]
He was already dead. How do you like that? Now that's the same.

[02:44:26.690 --> 02:44:27.530]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:44:28.350 --> 02:44:28.710]
Oh yeah.

[02:44:29.370 --> 02:44:34.730]
Similarly, Grypah's wife, Elizabeth, says that after she prayed to Pope John Paul the Tooth on behalf of her ailing husband,

[02:44:34.930 --> 02:44:40.050]
what Silla appeared to her in a dream holding a small child in his hand and walking on a road of white cobblestones.

[02:44:40.390 --> 02:44:49.890]
Mr. Grypah told Rush stop a newspaper. The 76 year old man was diagnosed with cancer three years ago and doctors told him the tumors which inspired him as long as kidney and spine were inoperable and would soon kill him.

[02:44:51.050 --> 02:44:59.010]
Archbishop Gerardo Piano brought the case to the Vatican after he learned the medically inexplicable recovery from doctors at San Leonardo Hospital in Salerno.

[02:44:59.010 --> 02:45:04.470]
The recovery is lasted. He told Il Martino newspaper November the second and a year and a half later the inexplicable remains confirmed.

[02:45:04.770 --> 02:45:08.890]
It was a prodigious innovation, a miracle of the first order Piedro said. How do you like that?

[02:45:09.270 --> 02:45:15.570]
A prodigious intervention, not just a regular pedestrian or an ordinary intervention, a prodigious one.

[02:45:15.930 --> 02:45:16.630]
I heard you say that.

[02:45:16.630 --> 02:45:17.130]
A prodigious.

[02:45:18.790 --> 02:45:20.350]
Where did he stick it? That's the question.

[02:45:20.410 --> 02:45:20.790]
Correct him.

[02:45:21.290 --> 02:45:22.210]
I mean the first time.

[02:45:24.270 --> 02:45:28.630]
So anyway, OJ has got the book coming out in November 30th if I did it and what a...

[02:45:29.150 --> 02:45:31.390]
Seriously, there are some things that just leave you limp.

[02:45:31.570 --> 02:45:31.810]
You know what I mean?

[02:45:32.030 --> 02:45:33.830]
It leaves you so weak that you just need to want to...

[02:45:33.830 --> 02:45:35.350]
You don't want to dignify them with a response.

[02:45:35.630 --> 02:45:37.390]
You know, like, what's it to say?

[02:45:38.090 --> 02:45:41.070]
And the best part of it is that a bunch of idiots are going to go out there and buy it.

[02:45:42.990 --> 02:45:43.670]
You know what I mean?

[02:45:43.950 --> 02:45:44.550]
Oh yeah, they will.

[02:45:44.550 --> 02:45:45.730]
And he'll make sure he'll...

[02:45:45.730 --> 02:45:45.730]

[02:45:45.890 --> 02:45:49.010]
Like these crazy people in that story, I just got through reading you about the miracles.

[02:45:49.650 --> 02:45:52.290]
The pub came to them in a dream. He was holding a small child.

[02:45:53.150 --> 02:45:55.770]
Maybe Mark Foller is going to come to them in a dream holding a child.

[02:45:55.830 --> 02:45:56.810]
Maybe not quite that small.

[02:45:58.390 --> 02:45:59.070]
It's David!

[02:45:59.210 --> 02:46:01.070]
Oh ho, if I ever need a child.

[02:46:01.690 --> 02:46:02.090]
Absolutely.

[02:46:02.550 --> 02:46:05.450]
At 560 WQA.

[02:46:07.410 --> 02:46:10.410]
Hi, this is OJ.

[02:46:10.410 --> 02:46:15.230]
Since I've been released from jail, I like to keep track of my bitches.

[02:46:15.830 --> 02:46:20.850]
So I recommend to you, new OJ Simpson's bitch jack for women.

[02:46:21.590 --> 02:46:25.590]
Believe me, brothers, you won't get jack with bitch jack.

[02:46:26.030 --> 02:46:29.810]
Just a tad to a small homie device, the old bitch's leg.

[02:46:30.450 --> 02:46:32.630]
And you can track her all around town.

[02:46:33.190 --> 02:46:36.930]
And just in case she jeetting, she'll get a beaten.

[02:46:36.930 --> 02:46:41.990]
You see, when your woman be messing around, new bitch jack for women

[02:46:41.990 --> 02:46:46.210]
Let's out an inaudible beefing sound, and only you can hear.

[02:46:46.890 --> 02:46:50.230]
And once they catch her, she's all yours.

[02:46:53.670 --> 02:46:57.470]
Excuse me, Mr. Simpson. We tracked down your old lady with a white man.

[02:46:58.070 --> 02:46:59.190]
What shall we do with her?

[02:46:59.450 --> 02:47:00.710]
Wow, thank you, officer.

[02:47:01.390 --> 02:47:02.410]
I'll handle this.

[02:47:02.950 --> 02:47:03.670]
You bitch.

[02:47:04.070 --> 02:47:06.270]
Don't you know I'm tracking you with bitch jack?

[02:47:06.270 --> 02:47:09.390]
I'ma cut your throat, you bitch. I'ma shoot you.

[02:47:09.490 --> 02:47:16.190]
So remember, your hold won't get very far with OJ Simpson's new bitch jack for women.

[02:47:16.590 --> 02:47:22.750]
Hey, just because OJ is free, don't mean your bitches got to be free too.

[02:47:24.470 --> 02:47:25.690]
Bitch, yeah.

[02:47:26.090 --> 02:47:26.890]
Bye, bye, bye.
