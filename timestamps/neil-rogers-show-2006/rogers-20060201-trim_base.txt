[00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:14.420]
How are you? Don't ask. What's the matter? It's a very long story which I don't know if you won't be here and you've got stuff to do there. You got to go and lose some money.

[00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.680]
No, I'm not losing money today. Why not? Because I'm here working believe it or not. It's the middle of the week.

[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:50.600]
I've been in that chair. I've been in that since I was a kid. I've been in that chair. I've been in that chair. I've been in that time. I've been in that chair. I've been in that time. I've been in that chair. I've been in that time. I've been in that chair. I've been in that time. I've been in that chair. I've been in that time. I've been in that chair. I've been in that chair. I've been in that chair. I've been in that chair. I've been in that chair. I've been in that chair. I've been in that chair. I've been in that chair. I've been in that chair. I've been in that chair. I've been in that chair. I've been in that chair. I've been in that chair. I've been in that chair. I've been in that chair. I've been in that chair. I've been in that chair. I've been in that chair. I've

[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:18.740]
been in that chair. I've been in that chair. I've been in that chair. I've been in that chair. I've been down to 50 years without afraid of anything of food. I've been lively. I've been dah does bad thing. I've beenätze, I've been bridegrooming my video for 30 years. That's my thing. I've been bedroom lifestyle lifestyle lifestyle lifestyle lifestyle lifestyle lifestyle lifestyle. Earlier this week we're doing a slightly similar little occasionally we do a business, you know gameplay, you know the topic of coincidence weighty and you know analyze the��게요, how much taht it is how much it all weighed over fucking shit and what an effort to you know timeline blockin' the

[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.580]
video for what an effort to you know Phot teaspoon edition, rip its doe, it's not a very interesting canonical glitch. It is a model moving

[00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.280]
I want to go, I'm not going anywhere.

[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.440]
But the fact of the matter is that we don't do a sports show.

[00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.040]
And the rest of this time, I'm like an island.

[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.400]
This crossover that you and I have every morning for a few minutes,

[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.680]
this is the only relationship I have with the rest of the radio station.

[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.520]
Yesterday I worked, yeah, I don't want to say worth feverishly on a stupid red coat.

[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.320]
The only reason I did was because I wanted to jam it down the other guy's throat,

[00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.120]
because they're obviously using that for a purpose.

[00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.020]
And it's a purpose-driven thing to try to give the public appearance that they're really

[00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.220]
either kicking our ass or they're like neck and neck.

[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.620]
And so when I finished it two o'clock, forget about the individual thing.

[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.420]
QAM versus 790.

[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.580]
We had 891 votes and they had 146.

[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.220]
You following that?

[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.640]
Yeah.

[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.600]
Now you know what it would be like if I was in a relay race,

[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.080]
which God forbid that, it's a thought of it as pretty sickening.

[00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.800]
But in a relay race and I opened up a gigantic secretariat like lead,

[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.340]
only 10 times that much of a lead.

[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.880]
And then the next guy in a relay comes along, a hand in the baton,

[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.900]
and the next guy sits down on the ground.

[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.300]
Yeah, Beast told me.

[00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.360]
He showed me what happened.

[00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.860]
Yeah.

[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.260]
And so as the day went on, every couple of hours I come in here and I look at the

[00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.920]
hero website, I'd see, our people are doing nothing.

[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.800]
And that's obviously because they weren't talking about it.

[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.840]
I mean, they didn't have to devote their whole shows about it.

[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.980]
But give me a little support.

[00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.000]
My name is Anon here.

[00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.160]
I got nothing to benefit from.

[00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.960]
It's a little pride in where you work and the people that you work with

[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.540]
and try to goose them up a little bit, you know?

[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.800]
It's called a team game.

[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.360]
And our people have blinders on, man.

[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.040]
They don't know what it means to be a team game.

[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.660]
I don't exist.

[00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.500]
Whatever happens between 10 and 2, man, might as well flush it down the toilet

[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.340]
as far as the sports nerds are concerned.

[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.060]
And it really pisses me off, big time.

[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.900]
But nevertheless, the fact that you're not in a poll in the first place.

[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.360]
Yeah.

[00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.300]
I mean, I can say I'm trying to goose up my own number.

[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.100]
I'm not on there.

[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.080]
I don't do a sports show.

[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.760]
So I have a chance to be like the arbor trader here like a little more objective,

[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.120]
you know?

[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.880]
So it's a phony.

[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.000]
You know, what did you think was going to happen?

[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.260]
No, no, then you're missing the point.

[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.560]
You don't understand.

[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.540]
It wouldn't have happened had our people been been banging away at it.

[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.480]
And I knew there are people.

[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.240]
Would that's fine?

[00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.160]
They're entitled to it.

[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.160]
They're a high deist.

[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.520]
They're set up.

[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.500]
But the fact of the matter is, and people can say, well, it's only a silly thing

[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.300]
in the correct code.

[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.040]
It's a blog.

[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.340]
It's in the newspaper.

[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.280]
And you know, as well as I do, when people read something in a newspaper,

[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.640]
90% of people, maybe 95% of people believe that it's true because they read it in the newspaper.

[00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.740]
Well, that depends on what newspaper it is.

[00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.220]
This is a psychological impression that boy, those guys are really, they're right up there

[00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.680]
with QA.

[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.900]
In fact, they're kicking their ass.

[00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.260]
You know, in fact, they're like, last time I looked at 38 votes ahead of us.

[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.560]
Yeah.

[00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.320]
I mean, a period of hours went by and we had increased by like 25 votes and they were like

[00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.500]
getting 300 more and 500 more and seven.

[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.960]
And I'm saying, I wanted to cry.

[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.020]
I wanted to say you're like an old woman and put my hand in my hands and get a, and just

[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.520]
cry.

[00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.460]
What the hell, what was the effort for yesterday for for?

[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.100]
I mean, it was fun.

[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.020]
We had some fun with it and it was different.

[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.580]
And it wasn't, you know, the same old track this and track that and track, track, track

[00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.700]
and me, I've been to, track to bend to go whatever that thing was.

[00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.940]
God.

[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.060]
Well, we got, we got some really desperate people on this station who just, you know, I'm

[00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.960]
just out of step, man.

[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.440]
I just, I'm in a different planet.

[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.700]
My concept of competing is totally different.

[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.660]
Maybe that's why I got numbers, you know, because I believe in competing.

[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.600]
I believe in taking somebody, taking the competition to wherever they might be and they're

[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.660]
not my competition.

[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.560]
I don't compete with them.

[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.780]
They don't have any number in midday.

[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.720]
But I believe in when you got them on a mat, you take, you put your hands around your

[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.040]
neck and your squeeze until they can't breathe anymore.

[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.320]
That's just the way you compete.

[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.220]
It's anytime a newspaper runs a poll, you're going to get a falling result.

[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.580]
I'm not sure what you can do about it either.

[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.920]
I mean, I know what you're trying to do.

[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.060]
But, you know, the bottom line is the polls, bogus.

[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.800]
I don't know about you.

[00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:12.540]
Anything I heard.

[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.640]
I heard everything you said.

[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.740]
You know, you know, we know that the poll is bogus.

[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.440]
We know that it has an, a purpose to it and intent.

[00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.960]
And the fact of the matter is I squashed that intent for four hours yesterday and the rest

[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.320]
of our people couldn't do the same thing.

[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.440]
We could be 2000 votes ahead of them right now.

[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.540]
But our people are too busy with the, and, and, and that's it.

[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.360]
And Jimmy and Danny and Dan, every now and then, and another, that.

[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.560]
You see, I, yeah, I think you're aware of it because you've been in this for a long

[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.780]
time.

[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.100]
We're not in the sports business.

[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.560]
We're in the entertainment business.

[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.840]
Right.

[00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.160]
We're here to entertain the public.

[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.580]
We're here like it, like Howard Beale said in network, we're in the boredom killing business.

[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.700]
That's right.

[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.060]
Well, it's the truth.

[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.440]
Yeah.

[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:51.520]
That's the truth.

[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.960]
And a lot of our people don't understand that.

[00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.220]
But nevertheless, I'm an island man.

[00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.280]
That's it.

[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.100]
After two o'clock, if they want to put on Ishkibibla and senior winces after two, I, I don't

[00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.580]
care anymore.

[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:06.320]
I just give up.

[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.120]
I throw in the towel.

[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.620]
If they get 50,000 votes on this pool, a more power to them.

[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.800]
At least their people are, you know, they're behind it and they're having some fun with

[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.580]
it and they're doing it.

[00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:22.100]
Well, even, even, even your close personal friend, even that one, even though it was always

[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.180]
negative and derogatory and hostile and he only needed everybody in the building and on

[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.880]
the outside too.

[00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.960]
But even he, you know, you would recognize you or me.

[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.500]
There was like, there was like some crossover, even though it was very negative and hostile.

[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.380]
But at least there was some, there was some continuity there, you know what I'm saying?

[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.600]
Hey, we always gave him a lot of air time.

[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:39.800]
Well, that's what I'm saying.

[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.120]
Well, Yusher is held in.

[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.280]
Yeah.

[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.820]
He took the door.

[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:42.140]
You see?

[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:43.000]
No.

[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.180]
And if he would have run with it, he could like, he might still be there.

[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:49.860]
He could have been there.

[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.300]
But a sense of humor, which he doesn't.

[00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:55.560]
But other than that, I'm just, I draw the line at two, whatever they put on, more power

[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:55.960]
to him.

[00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.500]
They, they can put Joyce farting on a year for four hours and it, and probably get a

[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.860]
bigger number than your friend got the last two.

[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.080]
You know what?

[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.300]
It, it couldn't because she doesn't make a sound.

[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:07.820]
No.

[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:08.980]
No, she's never farted.

[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.560]
I'm sure of that.

[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.080]
Not an upright bitch like her.

[00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.880]
Without sound.

[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.680]
She can't use sound.

[00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.260]
She doesn't, she does the SBDs.

[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.280]
That's where it came from.

[00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:16.920]
Mm-hmm.

[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:18.860]
Oh, I know where it came from.

[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.000]
Back to him.

[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:21.960]
Believe me.

[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.480]
Well, calm down.

[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:25.860]
Your life is good.

[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.840]
Outside of that place, my life is great.

[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:30.960]
Fensational.

[00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.200]
I could never ask for more.

[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.460]
I've, I've got my own issues right now with that.

[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:36.740]
Oh yeah.

[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:37.320]
Yeah.

[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.340]
Anything we want to hear about?

[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:40.160]
Yeah.

[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:40.980]
You know what?

[00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:42.780]
I, I, I, come on.

[00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:43.180]
Let's go.

[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.460]
I, I just unloaded.

[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.320]
See, I'm always the one that's got to open up a big mouth.

[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.220]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:47.760]
Who was this?

[00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:49.640]
I, I want to work the rest of the week.

[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.180]
As long as I'm here.

[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:51.900]
Yeah.

[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:56.320]
But, hey, you know, it's a, it's a, the usual thing, you know, we come up here and,

[00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:59.480]
uh, you should see the setup of those stations have.

[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.340]
I mean, they look like real radio stations.

[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:02.720]
Like, professionally.

[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.940]
You know, I see banners and first-rate equipment.

[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.140]
We have, you know, headsets that got, didn't work when we got here.

[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.220]
Water was affecting the headsets.

[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.740]
We have, um, my name is not on anything here.

[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.200]
I mean, that, you know, it's just.

[00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.340]
Not a big deal, I guess.

[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:18.600]

[00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.380]
You know, they send us all, but everybody else has,

[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:27.820]
everybody else has an engineer or producer and, you know, you know, there are two or

[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:28.940]
three people per station.

[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:34.380]
Here, it's just me and the beast and the beast who is, credit is, you know, really

[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:34.840]
hustling.

[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.860]
But, uh, we're under man compared to everybody here.

[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:38.820]
Hmm.

[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:39.420]
What a shock.

[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:40.060]
Yeah.

[00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:43.080]
See, we got a new guy in there and he seems like a really good guy.

[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.360]
In fact, I sent him another lengthy email at midnight last night because I was really,

[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:47.620]
I was just filming at them out.

[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:53.280]
And, uh, he means well, but he's inherited such a nightmare that I just don't know, like

[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.940]
I said before, it's the Humpty Dumpty Syndrome.

[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.580]
Greg broke it into so many zillion pieces.

[00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.560]
I don't know that anybody can put the pieces back together again.

[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.360]
The egg is broken.

[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.100]
The egg shellers are laying in tatters now, you know, and they're in denial about it,

[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.480]
you know, they can bring in all the new sales people.

[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.240]
We got a hundred new sales people now.

[00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:10.780]
Every morning now, they bring in another new sales broad.

[00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:11.820]
Hey, here's this one.

[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:12.400]
Here's that one.

[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.640]
I had a listen, this, this will put a smile on your face.

[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.620]
They brought in some chick this morning who's been with us.

[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:19.440]
I don't know, a couple of months.

[00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:20.280]
I don't know what her name is.

[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:20.760]
Even forgot.

[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.040]
She was that memorable.

[00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.640]
And she says he used to work in Viral Beach and on a station that carried my show.

[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.860]
I said, no, I said, oh, yes, you were on.

[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.600]
I said, no, I've never been on Viral Beach or any other radio station.

[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.300]
Yeah, no, I'm positive.

[00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.360]
You were on our station.

[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:40.220]
Okay.

[00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:41.980]
Does that paint the picture for you?

[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:43.960]
Yeah.

[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.920]
See, I told you, you get a little chuckle out of that.

[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.660]
Oh, wow, the spiff squad.

[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:49.840]
Uh-huh.

[00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:52.400]
Stippy.

[00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:57.940]
Yeah, I'm sure that mine is gone too for the rest of my life after this.

[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.960]
Boy, by the way, how many of you go from an eight hundred years ago?

[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.100]
Excuse me, yo, because I didn't get a call from an eight hundred year old.

[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:05.760]
You're being behind.

[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:06.800]
That's what I'd like to know.

[00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:08.100]
Who dropped the ball?

[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.500]
Who dropped the ball, Bo?

[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.580]
And of course, we got this two to four revolving dough for Mo.

[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:14.380]
Here we go.

[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:15.080]
Good for the gusset.

[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:15.780]
Good for the gander.

[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.160]
What is it?

[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.960]
What's good for the goose is good for the gander.

[00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:21.520]
Yeah, goose this, Bo camper.

[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.580]
Doll is a five year old razor blade.

[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.040]
I'd like to watch women's softball.

[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.140]
Well, go ahead.

[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.120]
I'm looking at this thing now.

[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.100]
Joe Rose has pulled it even with mandage.

[00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.460]
I know 296 apiece.

[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:37.960]
I know that.

[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.000]
Don't you think I'm keeping track?

[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.360]
And you know something I'm done with it.

[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:41.620]
I'm on my hands off.

[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.500]
If they want to get 50,000 votes on there, great.

[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:45.420]
More power to them.

[00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:46.300]
I say, hallelujah.

[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:46.800]
Good job.

[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:47.240]
Well done.

[00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:51.720]
You know, you know how bogus and the only see you keep saying it's bogus.

[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:55.900]
The only reason it's bogus is because our people are allowing them to make it bogus.

[00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:00.260]
It's like it's like they borrowed the die-bowl voting machines from the bush people.

[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:01.940]
You know, right away.

[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.300]
You know what I, you know what this station reminds me of?

[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.500]
Our sports.

[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.040]
Maybe it's just a late turnout.

[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:11.560]
Yeah.

[00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:12.420]
All right.

[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:16.860]
When the rural vote comes in from sweet water and ojas, then they're really going to kick our ass.

[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:17.060]
Right.

[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:19.400]
Well, I got nothing to do with any of this.

[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.620]
And I don't, I don't do a sports show.

[00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:24.220]
I'm giving up after the Leafs lost again on the shootout last night.

[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.400]
I'm giving up sports all together.

[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.320]
And any a bell for couldn't stop a bowling ball from a hundred yards away.

[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:32.180]
Shoot out my ass.

[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.260]
Well, that's what Joyce said.

[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:33.660]
I'm sorry.

[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.140]
So yeah.

[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.960]
Well, listen, you guys have a good time.

[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:40.940]
It don't be wandering around.

[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:42.720]
Listen, I lived there, man, for two years.

[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.280]
Don't be wandering around Detroit at the beast.

[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.140]
Unless you've got a death wish.

[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:48.300]
You're a crazy person.

[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.540]
He won money in a casino.

[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:50.500]
He was a mark.

[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.620]
How far did you walk in the dark about a mile?

[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:54.300]
No.

[00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.580]
He's still alive.

[00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:57.360]
Wow.

[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.700]
It was cold and dark.

[00:11:59.220 --> 00:11:59.620]
Wow.

[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.040]
They probably thought they saw you.

[00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:02.460]
They probably thought the spaceship landed.

[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:03.540]
They ran the other direction.

[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:04.760]
God.

[00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.400]
It's a walking bowling ball.

[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.620]
Let's get out of here.

[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.360]
They probably thought it was Rover from the prisoner.

[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.660]
Well, listen, you guys have a good time.

[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:15.980]
Yeah.

[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.480]
And don't lose too much now.

[00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:19.920]
Just remember, don't be in your head.

[00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.540]
The carving pack would say, bet with your head not over it.

[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.700]
I'll be leaving for Las Vegas on Friday.

[00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:25.620]
So are you really?

[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:26.060]
Yes.

[00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:27.160]
Well, you going on vacation?

[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:27.680]
No.

[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.560]
Well, I'm going to take a couple of days off.

[00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:29.760]
Yeah.

[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:30.360]
But I'm doing.

[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.460]
I'm taking a couple of off-study right now.

[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.260]
I do the gambling story on ESPN some day on the summer.

[00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:37.440]
I'm going out this afternoon.

[00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.380]
Or I wasn't going to, but I'm at 2 o'clock.

[00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.400]
The excuse being that my maid comes at 2 on Wednesday.

[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:42.900]
Which she does.

[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.080]
So I got to get out of here.

[00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:44.560]
Yeah.

[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:45.540]
I'm going out there.

[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.120]
I don't care if I lose what I lose.

[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.260]
If I lose $8,000,000 there today, it'll be better than being around here

[00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.720]
and getting all bogged down with this place.

[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.700]
This is a killer of this place.

[00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:57.480]
This is just a killer debilitating.

[00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:01.380]
You know, they should be the best boyfriends that are there.

[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.380]
They're scratching his head and scratching his package.

[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.260]
You wonder, how come he's upset again?

[00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.100]
He's getting off a testy lately.

[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:08.600]
You know, he don't get it.

[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.120]
George had to go in there for half an hour

[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.740]
to give him a seminar on why we're pissed off.

[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.380]
A real newspaper wouldn't publish a poll like that.

[00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:15.420]
Why not?

[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:16.300]
It's for fun.

[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:16.660]
OK.

[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:17.440]
It's the obwe...

[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.820]
We had just as much opportunity to stack the deck as they did.

[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:21.180]
OK.

[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:21.680]
And we did.

[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:22.060]
I did.

[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.460]
I said 891 to 146.

[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:25.060]
Is that close?

[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:25.620]
No.

[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.840]
We had that lavastured pack for exactly what he is.

[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:30.920]
A phony baloney, man.

[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.740]
They're all in bed together over there, including I think Bougain lavastured.

[00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.040]
I hear a lot of stories about that.

[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:37.480]
Figuratively and literally.

[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:39.600]
I think they're doing something.

[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.060]
I think they saw that cowboy movie too many times.

[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:44.420]
Like Push and Shrine.

[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:45.560]
Yeah.

[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:46.340]
Oh yeah.

[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.300]
How do you like Cheney's eyeballs rolling around last night?

[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.200]
I wasn't going to watch any of it, but I saw the last few minutes

[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.860]
and the democratic, pathetic response when Bouges talk about alternative sources

[00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:57.240]
and getting away from dependence on Middle East or like.

[00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.580]
I thought Cheney's eyeballs are going to pop out of his head.

[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:00.040]

[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.480]
Presently, you know, they'll all be long dead by that time anyway.

[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.760]
So it's just all talk.

[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.140]
I won't be talking about that poll when we're all dead.

[00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:10.600]
That's for sure.

[00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:12.820]
Well, you have a good day and stay.

[00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.040]
I'm going to give it a shot.

[00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:14.720]
Okay.

[00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.040]
I'm going ballistic to them.

[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.800]
I'm just going to scream for four hours.

[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.440]
Well, we'll try to listen to some of this.

[00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:22.240]
I'm going to go here.

[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:23.660]
Have a good time.

[00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:24.100]
YouTube.

[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:24.600]
Thanks.

[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:26.880]
For three times boys talk.

[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:28.640]
The mad dog.

[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:29.820]
The mad dog.

[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:35.120]
I wonder if any of those writers that we're calling for talk show hosts that we're calling

[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.940]
from around the country, feels stupid.

[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:43.980]
Having compared the Indianapolis Colts to a perfect season team at this point.

[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:50.500]
Honestly, I'm a little bit more than Dolphin's had a week schedule and I think it's just broke right.

[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.880]
Miss that and the other happy horse manure.

[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.300]
Well, I don't know what they're saying and thinking right now.

[00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:00.040]
Or do you not hear from Morgana until the next team runs out 12 and 0.

[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.660]
You managed your sports authority.

[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:06.000]
We changed from 47 on sports radio 565.

[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.120]
Q8 M.

[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.000]
Absolutely want to kill this.

[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.800]
I have got a lot of these.

[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.320]
Oh, Jimmy and Danny.

[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:18.440]
Jimmy and Danny.

[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:19.760]
Danny and Danny.

[00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:23.660]
Danny and Danny and Danny.

[00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:23.920]
Danny and Danny.

[00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.080]
Danny and Danny and Danny.

[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:32.860]
Danny and Danny and Danny.

[00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.000]
Danny and Danny.

[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:39.440]
We have a mobile from Miramar. Hello.

[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.320]
Can you hear me okay? I got a question.

[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:43.720]
Jimmie and Danny's situation.

[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.060]
I have. Jimmy and Danny.

[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.600]
Jimmy and Danny.

[00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:50.420]
Jimmy and Danny.

[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:53.340]
Jimmy and Danny.

[00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.260]
Jimmy and Danny.

[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:57.060]
Jimmy and Danny.

[00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:58.320]
Jimmy and Danny.

[00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.040]
Jimmy and Danny.

[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:02.500]
Jimmy and Danny.

[00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:08.720]
Jimmy and Danny.

[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.160]
Jimmy and Danny.

[00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:13.740]
Jimmy and Danny.

[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.300]
Jimmy and Danny.

[00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.400]
Jimmy and Danny.

[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:20.640]

[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.460]
Jimmy and Danny.

[00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:22.280]
Jimmy and Danny.

[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:25.900]
I'm going to talk more about Jimmy and Danny after this word from Valley

[00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:29.240]
Alonso Fossils, wherever he fought and comes with his own frigid air.

[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.260]
Yeah, but what about...

[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.220]
Yeah, you're with him out.

[00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:32.520]
Well, we could do it over.

[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:33.080]
Okay.

[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:34.120]
Five.

[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:38.620]
10, 14, and 5, 60 WDQM.

[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.000]
It's Wednesday, February 1st.

[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.160]
Today, it will go down in...

[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.480]
In for me, as far as I'm concerned.

[00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:43.800]
For what a place.

[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:45.540]
For what a place.

[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:46.900]
And like I said, I'm done.

[00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.160]
I'm all done with that phony baloney.

[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.600]
You guys are on your own, huh?

[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:51.420]
Well, it's about time.

[00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:52.020]
Yeah.

[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:53.620]
Yeah, you're right.

[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:54.220]
I'm a slow learner.

[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.480]
I got nobody to blame by myself.

[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.120]
I put my best foot forward there yesterday.

[00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.980]
We kicked some serious bloody ass.

[00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:03.000]
And then the rest of it, like I said, rolled over and they spread their legs in there.

[00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:03.640]
And I was in.

[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:05.420]
Well, that's a nice image.

[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:06.100]
Yeah.

[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:08.040]
Especially bow camber.

[00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.740]
Well, he's gotten fond of that cow that sits in front of the university dog.

[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:12.000]
I don't know.

[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.380]
The one he stole from Dan Bouts.

[00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:15.280]
Hey, if you're in a dead end.

[00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:15.980]
Oh, all right!

[00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:17.460]
Sportsman?

[00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:20.400]
Roll, wind, tree, what did you do?

[00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:23.680]
To just stay a book that wasn't quite true?

[00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.860]
Roll, wind, tree, defend the James Fry.

[00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:29.860]
Though we told the Millions, little lies.

[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:33.440]
He wrote a book about his time and we had.

[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.760]
But now it seems that we've all been had.

[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:39.800]
Next we'll find out he never stole the crap.

[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:44.000]
He wasn't addicted to collect, ding, stands.

[00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:46.720]
I think Daddy's full of it.

[00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:49.520]
Roll, wind, tree, what did we do?

[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.820]
We only read books that you tell us to.

[00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:56.200]
Maybe you are the one who's on the drugs.

[00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:00.360]
But pulling this book in opens up love.

[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.620]
Boy, opens up love.

[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:11.740]
1018 at 560 WQA in the home of absolute madness, man.

[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:12.940]
Just madness.

[00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.760]
I have never seen more coolest people who just don't get it.

[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:20.500]
Jimmy and Danny and Danny and Max, yeah, at any rate.

[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.080]
I was kind of depressed though.

[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:26.140]
I told Hank the whole story and he gave me like a non-sequitor that responds about,

[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.600]
well, you know, it's a bogus pole.

[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:28.480]
You hear that?

[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:29.700]
Yeah, I heard it.

[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:30.480]
What is that?

[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.340]
Well, it's a bogus pole that doesn't mean that we can't.

[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:37.820]
I understand that, but we think there's ever much as opportunity to fix the election.

[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:38.960]
The boy's people did.

[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.700]
Oh, the phone's ringing.

[00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:43.040]
That means the bogus disk is down there.

[00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:43.720]
You know what? Good.

[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.680]
What do you think about that one bit though, huh?

[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.840]
Oh, man, you talk about the blind leading the blind.

[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.540]
Nice going again, Beasley.

[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.160]
You guys are right on top of it.

[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:05.320]
You see, they could bring in Albert Einstein, Carl Sagan, all these that they could resurrect all of these brilliant dead people.

[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:08.200]
And they could put them in a management team at that place.

[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.580]
And as long as the Beasley's are, you know, pulling the strings,

[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.220]
it isn't going to make a chat in a bit of difference in hell.

[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:14.800]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:15.440]
What do you say?

[00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:18.300]
I'm saying that, I tell you what it is.

[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.120]
10 to 2, baby.

[00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:19.980]
Just keep that in mind.

[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.000]
10 to 2 p.m.

[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:21.600]
Oh, I see.

[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:21.780]
I see.

[00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:21.840]
I see.

[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:21.940]
I see.

[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:22.300]

[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:22.320]
I see.

[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:22.700]
I see.

[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:22.820]
I see.

[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:23.420]
I see.

[00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:23.420]

[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:23.480]

[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:24.560]
I see.

[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:25.680]
I see.

[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:25.780]

[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:25.780]

[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:26.580]
I see.

[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:27.820]
I see.

[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:29.320]
I see.

[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.560]
I see.

[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:32.460]
I see.

[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:37.220]
I see.

[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.200]
I see.

[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:44.340]
I see.

[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:44.340]

[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:44.680]
It's going to be a pride.

[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.340]
I even get paid once in a while on payday.

[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:51.960]
But Jesus Christ Almighty, this, this, this myopic, it's like,

[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.020]
it's like our people have blinders on you know.

[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.980]
All they can see is the Super Bowl and Shaq.

[00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:00.180]
Shaq and the Super, I mean, what else is going on in sports right now?

[00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:01.260]
Is there anything else going on?

[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:03.140]
Does anybody here about the Panthers?

[00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:03.520]
No.

[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.480]
Does anybody care about Hurricane Basketball?

[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:05.780]
No.

[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:06.900]
We can talk about that.

[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:08.020]
What, here's what might be going on?

[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.260]
What else is going on now?

[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:11.800]
I'll be decide to Super Bowl a Sunday which I realize that's big.

[00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.120]
And of course, and the heat.

[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:13.780]
That's it

[00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:18.340]
Chad's Josh whatever your name is can you yeah, Josh check

[00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:24.440]
What else am I missing is there something else going on? I mean that in hockey. That's it. Let me say again

[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:27.740]
Nobody I know that I'm just

[00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:33.420]
In South Florida curious about hockey. No, I remember they wouldn't know Ed Belfer from saw be helpful

[00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.460]
Okay, they haven't got any idea what I'm talking about

[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.180]
So I think I got my thumb right on the there. That's all there is super bowl

[00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:45.860]
And so it doesn't require that much effort to go out of your way a little bit and say hey guess what we realize

[00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:52.300]
It's a bogus and it's it's a gear to make the other guys look like contenders and you know you can go on and say well when the book comes out

[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:56.520]
That's all that counts well. Take a look at that December number. Okay, so maybe the dolphins did win six in a row

[00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.780]
And maybe they got a little goose from that but guess what maybe that wasn't it

[00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:01.780]
Maybe that wasn't what it was all about

[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:07.560]
I don't know because I don't listen to them and even if I was in town I wouldn't listen them under penalty of death

[00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:14.120]
But the fact that it matter is that they're out there like plugging away and we're sitting back like and these guys

[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:17.880]
Unlike the other ones. It's not like life on a flea off you ask like the first fan

[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:23.640]
1800 on the dial that nobody could pick up with at the Joe Barry and mortis these distraught and the other swole

[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.540]
They I mean these guys got mostly swole on the year two separate Joe

[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:33.020]
But they got you know daddy's money this one Joel fineberg's daddy and the two gods is daddy

[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:36.400]
They got some money behind him and a lot of those people used to work on this station

[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:40.980]
So they got a bug up there as they hate us like poison. They'd like to they would do anything to hurt us

[00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:46.680]
That's what I heard yeah, and that what that's what Joe Bell said they would do anything to punish us

[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:52.760]
And I said believe me if anybody deserves to be punished all we're gonna look at the Katrina hearings to the first

[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.560]
Ever. Yeah, there you go

[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.700]
It's talk that way

[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.960]
My god, he's dumber than a box of

[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:06.500]
Chalk roaches dumber than a box of Hershey's chocolate

[00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:01.040]
I don't because it's called beef steak Charlie's I don't remember if the meat was any good or not

[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:05.420]
You never had a beef steak there at Charlie no, and when I kept thinking about Houston

[00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:10.040]
Houston's is not a steakhouse. I don't care what you guys try to give me a song of dance

[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:11.980]
And that's not what it's famous for

[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:17.140]
What's it got like sandwiches and kind of artsy partsy salads with a honey mustard dressing

[00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:20.480]
That's out of this world and they got like all all kinds of stuff like that big burgers

[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:24.420]
It's not a steakhouse. Why I mean I talked to some people about it. It's not a steakhouse

[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:28.400]
But it's not famous for anything in particular. That's for damn sure that is true

[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:34.160]
But it happens to be a very good place just because it's not famous doesn't mean it's not a good place. I

[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:34.880]
Said it was fine

[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:40.180]
But I'm just trying to tell you okay. I don't want to argue if you had a steak and you enjoyed it

[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:47.200]
That's not the place I go for steak go to terror steak and lobster. I find new sponsors out of this world. Okay, okay

Go to a place where that's known for steak in fact

[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:54.840]
There used to be that place on the causeway there by where we used to work called the place for steak

[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:58.520]
I wonder why they called it that I don't know because it was a place for steak

[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:04.100]
Anyway, beef steak Charlie's 46th the ground and I it's like people that go into like a

[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:47.560]
I give up.

[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.440]
Standing in the shadows of Motown?

[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:51.000]
Yeah.

[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:51.680]
Alright.

Watch it again.

[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:54.980]
You know who I like?

[00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:57.400]
I mean I love Ben Harper but you know how we like the best?

[00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:58.160]
John Osborne.

[00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:58.960]
Oh.

[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.040]
She's so good at scary.

[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:02.060]
Very good.

[00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:06.400]
And you know it's toward the ass end of the movie when she does what becomes of the broken hearted.

[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:06.900]
Right.

[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:09.660]
And the guy's like conducting the orchestra there.

[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:15.720]
You know, I'm fixated on that because the rest all the other songs that people sing he's not doing that.

[00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:17.900]
I don't know what he's doing or who he is.

[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.920]
I think he's I don't know who he is.

[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:21.980]
Maybe just walking up the street.

[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:24.220]
That could be it.

[00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:29.000]
But God that is just so and you're like in the drummer just go and nuts there.

[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.180]
It's just too good to be true.

[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:35.380]
You know, by the way I think a caller might have mentioned it but I've seen advertisement for them.

[00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:35.940]
They're on tour.

[00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:37.860]
The phone brothers?

[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:38.240]

[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:52.340]
I mean you know like what do I know about anything but I still say if they would if they would get the recording artist Gerald Avert and Ben Harper and Joe Osborne and everybody except for Shaka Khan.

[00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:56.840]
And the other people who were in that movie and do all the Motown stuff and make like a double set CD.

[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:58.440]
It would sell a Zidian copies.

[00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:00.220]
I know I go out and buy a hundred of them.

[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:01.820]
Yeah, that's still one.

[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:02.920]
I mean God.

[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:04.080]
Happy.

[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:14.680]

[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:14.680]

[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:14.680]

[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:14.680]

[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:14.680]

[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:14.680]

[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:14.680]

[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:14.680]

[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:14.680]

[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:29.640]
Oh.

[00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:34.020]
Oh.

[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:34.240]

[00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:35.260]

[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:35.920]

[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:35.920]

[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:36.660]
Oh.

[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:37.560]

[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:38.500]
Oh.

[00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:41.260]
Oh.

Oh.

Oh.

Oh.

[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:44.620]

[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:44.620]

[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:44.660]

[00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:01.100]
Oh.

[00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:02.340]
Oh.

[00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:02.340]

[00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:02.460]
Oh.

[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:06.200]
Oh.

[00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:11.340]
Oh.

[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:14.640]

[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:14.640]

[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:14.640]

[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:14.640]

Oh.

[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:36.500]

[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:36.500]

[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:36.620]
Oh.

[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:36.620]

[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:38.020]
Oh.

[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:39.260]
Oh.

[00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:44.100]
Oh.

[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:44.460]

[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:44.460]

[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:44.480]

[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:44.480]

[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:44.500]

[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:44.500]

[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:44.500]

[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:44.500]

[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:44.500]

[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:44.500]

[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:44.500]

[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:44.500]

[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:44.520]

[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:44.520]

[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:00.160]
Oh.

[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.580]
Oh.

[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:01.860]
Oh.

[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:03.040]
Oh.

[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:11.700]
Oh.

[00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:12.940]
Oh.

[00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:14.460]

[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:14.500]

[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:14.500]

[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:14.500]

[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:14.500]

[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:18.500]
Help me, help me, help me

[00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:23.520]
Help me, help me, help me, help me

Help me, help me, help me

[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:44.520]

[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:47.140]
Hi, y'all!

[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:47.460]
Woah,在哭

[00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:50.880]
What have you done?

[00:35:53.980 --> 00:36:00.400]
Why, keep going

[00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:07.500]
來了

[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:11.480]
Oh, yeah.

[00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:12.300]
Oh, yeah.

[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:13.240]
Oh, yeah.

[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.400]
Oh, yeah.

[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.860]
Oh, yeah.

[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:17.720]
Oh, yeah.

[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:19.820]
Oh, yeah.

[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:20.020]

[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:20.380]
Oh, yeah.

[00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:20.440]
Oh, yeah.

[00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:20.540]

[00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:20.840]
Oh, yeah.

[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:20.840]

[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:21.000]
Oh, yeah.

[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:21.440]
Oh, yeah.

[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:22.520]
Oh, yeah.

[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:23.940]
Oh, yeah.

[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:24.660]
Oh, yeah.

[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.080]
Oh, yeah.

[00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:28.100]
Oh, yeah.

[00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:29.720]
Oh, yeah.

[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:48.300]
Okay.

[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:59.540]
Oh, yeah.

[00:36:59.540 --> 00:36:59.540]

[00:36:59.540 --> 00:36:59.540]

[00:36:59.540 --> 00:36:59.540]

[00:36:59.540 --> 00:36:59.540]

[00:36:59.540 --> 00:36:59.540]

[00:36:59.540 --> 00:36:59.540]

[00:36:59.540 --> 00:36:59.540]

[00:36:59.540 --> 00:36:59.540]

[00:36:59.540 --> 00:36:59.540]

[00:36:59.540 --> 00:36:59.540]

[00:36:59.540 --> 00:36:59.540]

[00:36:59.540 --> 00:36:59.540]

[00:36:59.540 --> 00:36:59.540]

[00:36:59.540 --> 00:36:59.680]
And all right.

[00:36:59.680 --> 00:36:59.680]

[00:36:59.680 --> 00:36:59.680]

[00:36:59.680 --> 00:36:59.680]

[00:36:59.680 --> 00:36:59.680]

[00:36:59.680 --> 00:36:59.680]

[00:36:59.680 --> 00:36:59.700]
You're like that.

[00:36:59.700 --> 00:36:59.700]

[00:36:59.700 --> 00:36:59.700]

[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:04.140]
that. Not taking personal, but if you don't like Motown, we just hate you like poison,

[00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:09.220]
okay? We hope that something like music. That's correct. Very well put. If you don't

[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:12.560]
like this movie, then you don't like movies. You like that guy to call dinner? Why do you

[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:17.680]
talk about movies? That's why I mean, who the hell likes movies, you know? God. Like,

[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:21.960]
why would you talk about food and restaurants? Who the hell likes food? I don't know. You

[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:25.560]
can be talking about sports. Oh, everybody likes chocolate. Coming evidence that the

[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:30.680]
nurse and how it's so loud. How and so would be and why needs becoming evident that

[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:38.140]
you're crazy, Ray. You're the chocolate crazy man. 1041 at 560 WQA. I'm a place that

[00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:44.280]
could drive you into instant insanity. This place is just a lawyer. One thing about QAAM,

[00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:52.680]
it's got a long past, a long history. I'm not so sure about the future. Man, good. And

[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:56.340]
you know, the only thing that I'm thinking, what is the only thing you're thinking? Because

[00:37:56.340 --> 00:38:01.740]
when Sarni had that poll about Jimmy Cifalist and Joe on the dolphin game and the mandate

[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:05.740]
came down from our previous management and of course, you can never find out who really

[00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:10.200]
was responsible. It's like, well, who decided about this best of thing? You know, anybody's

[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.980]
got a different story and you can never get the really honest answer. Everybody's covering

[00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:17.160]
her ass, you know? That was the same thing with that. So maybe our guys just assume that

[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:20.680]
because it's a newspaper poll, we're just going to ignore it because we've been told

[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:24.660]
to do that because I can't believe that they have so little self-respect, so little

[00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:28.800]
feisty. I believe in something in this business. I know it's a very unusual concept. You

[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:34.040]
know what the word is? I give up competing. Oh, no. Yeah. I believe in competing like

[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:38.280]
big time. Like I said to Hank, you're grabbing a guy by the neck and just strangling until

[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:41.160]
there's not an ounce of blood left in it. You feel like you've accomplished something

[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:45.560]
and you walk away and you move on for the next, oh, speaking of whiny. We're on notice

[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:48.860]
a new look. Oh, God, it's you. Leave him in. I may.

[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:53.940]
I haven't told you about dry concepts. Nothing will be about them for over 20 years. They've

[00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:57.260]

[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:34.260]
I was sleeping in the park just trying to take a seat. I got home in the dark. It left

[00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:47.600]
me black and blue. I'm hurt so bad. I'm coughing a blood. Why was I beaten by teenagers

[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:57.920]
with clubs? Don't know why this happened. I took the clothes to the head. They took off.

[00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:08.780]
They were laughing. They left me here for death. I've got an ass. Were they high on drugs?

[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:26.780]
Yes. Why was I beaten by teenagers with clubs? I'm dying of it. I'm lying here. I'm

[00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:36.260]
a swung-unlocked baby routine. I can ask the parents why they raised their kids this way.

[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:47.200]
Lots and lots of prison time. They'll be the price they pay. What then and jail with all

[00:41:47.200 --> 00:42:01.040]
those other folks? Why was I beaten by teenagers with clubs? Why was I beaten by teenagers

[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:09.320]
with clubs? Why was I beaten by... I was going up there with headphones that don't work

[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:14.840]
and no sign. Nobody knows who he is. We got some little cardboard thing that says QA and

[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:20.220]
I'm here. It's typical. When you're working for a bunch of red-necked slabs, that's what

[00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:27.240]
the beesleys, this Yahoo eintree mentality. I guarantee you that kid with that band you're

[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:39.620]
up there in that tree. I guarantee you he was a bee-ly kin in deliverance. I remember the

[00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:42.760]
first time I walked in that building, I kept thinking back of it. What a bad mistake that

[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:50.260]
was. It looked like people were using the building as a universal toilet. Man, it was filled

[00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:58.140]
with carpets and on the walls. I thought, what a toilet this place is. It still is. Of course,

[00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:04.240]
it was heavenly compared to the place that it were before. Oh, they were talking about that

[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:10.420]
other place. What? I'm talking about the building that you're sitting right now. Man, I just

[00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:16.120]
couldn't believe that anybody would work in such a festering sewer. Then the place you used

[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:19.700]
to be, and I came there that one day to pick you up. Where are we going? To go pick up that

[00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:24.780]
car or something. Oh my God. I walked in there and I thought to myself, this is a radio station.

[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:31.280]
I bet you that there are septic tanks that have a more sanitary interior than that building.

[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:35.860]
What are you wearing? They used well water over there. Apparently, the water was in a sulfur

[00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:39.800]
deposit so you could wash your hands and it smelled like crap. Yeah, building smelled like

[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:43.600]
crap. It smelled like a Josh Reuben and the fat boy were doing something in there together.

[00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:52.380]
I don't want to say what, but not the picture. Yeah, exactly. Good, golly miss Molly. That's

[00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:55.920]
the mentality of these people. They have no pride. Maybe that's maybe a rubbed off on

[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:59.160]
everybody else. I don't know. They have no pride in what they do. It's just a money-making

[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:04.500]
machine. That's all. It's like most other businesses now within this radio, just a jukebox.

[00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:13.540]
There's a lot of money through there and that's it. I'm just a guest. Every time I think like

[00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:16.980]
yesterday, we're all whipped up and becoming like a manic depressive every other day.

[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:23.720]
Like Bill called us to say a manic depressive with no ups. Yeah, that's what I'm feeling like

[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:28.400]
with this whole deal. You might want to tell clearance that being program director of a

[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:32.900]
major market radio station or what supposedly is, is not an on-the-job and learn as you go

[00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:41.600]
kind of a occupation. It just doesn't work that way. We were doing fine before. At least

[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:46.400]
we had somebody there. We had a presence. We went, well, there are so many examples.

[00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:50.200]
What am I talking about? You see, you're letting me do it again. Stop doing it. No, I know.

[00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:55.020]
I was reading doubt doing it. I got her. She's in my pile here very soon. She's like a

[00:44:55.020 --> 00:45:00.300]
little right after Sidi Shien. All right. This relax. I got my thing here. I'm going to read

[00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:05.920]
all time and read these stories on the air. Yeah, I saw your comment there on the Greg

[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:11.340]
Kotex website. Whatever the guy's name was. I forget his name. David Schmendrick.

[00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:16.980]
He got well, Neo Rodgers. All he does is kill time with his pull all day and read the

[00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:21.060]
stories to kill some time. Yeah, kill some time. I asked, okay. I don't realize it doesn't

[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:23.880]
have anything to do with ball games. In addition to which he's listening anyway. Right.

[00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:28.160]
He's not one of these guys. He's got all the answers in the world, but the meantime he's

[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:31.500]
listening. We're not just killing time. We're torturing it slowly. That's it. That's

[00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:35.680]
what we do at 2m. We're torturing you slowly like that song. We're going to give you

[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:42.320]
no flak. How much is playing Motown all day? Yeah. I'm telling you, man, if you want to

[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:47.920]
see a great movie, don't take my word for it. Go get it. Steal it. Rent it. Barrow it.

[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:54.000]
Don't bring it back. Standing in the shadows of Motown. There's a bird of flak without

[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.800]
Donnie halfway on that one. That was from the movie Playmasbee for me. That was in

[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:02.740]
there. I beg your pardon? I said, yes, it wasn't it. With Clint Eastwood and Jessica Walter

[00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:07.880]
and what's your name? The lovely from Not Slanding. Donna Mills. What a memory. That was good

[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:12.200]
movie. I've seen that about 85 times. Playmasbee for me. It was good. What was her name now in

[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:23.560]
the movie? Oh, I forgot. Jessica Walter. What was the character? Oh, come on. Life

[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:27.340]
is so beautiful. That's the Clint Eastwood movie. I like dirty Harry. That's just name for

[00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:33.860]
me. The only thing was we've talked about it a million times. He was the discock he

[00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:38.800]
playing the smooth jazz there. By the way, Carmel California is so beautiful. It's scary.

[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:45.400]
So the scenery is really good in there too. But he's playing at the smooth jazz and he's

[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:52.180]
up the record by putting he puts the record on the turntable. He sticks the needle on

[00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:59.280]
it. He's talking. I'm going to go cue this record up now. The needle watch it. They

[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:03.980]
need a technical advisor for that. It was kind of like QA. They didn't have any radio

[00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:10.520]
people. Act of a Cindy She in arrested at the Capitol. Cindy She and the mother of a

[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:14.060]
fallen soldier in Iraq who were reintegrated into the anti-war movement was arrested and

[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:17.780]
removed from the house gallery last night just before President Bush's BS stated the

[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:22.200]
Union address a police spokeswoman said. She and who was invited to attend the speech

[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:25.660]
by representative Lynn Wolsey of California was charged with demonstrating in a Capitol

[00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:29.760]
building. Said Capitol Police Sergeant Kimberly Schneider. The charge was later changed to

[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:35.580]
one awful conduct. Schneider said both charges are Mr. Meeners. She and was taken in handcuffs

[00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:39.440]
from the Capitol to police headquarters a few blocks away. Her case was processed as Bush

[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:44.660]
spoke. How do you like that? While he was talking his BS, they were prosecuting for Cindy

[00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:49.720]
She in. Schneider said she had worn a t-shirt with an anti-war slogan of the speech and covered

[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:53.520]
it up until she took her seat. Police order that such displays were not allowed but she

[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:57.340]
didn't respond to spoke from and said. Police handcuffs Cindy and removed her from the

[00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:01.260]
gallery before Bush arrived. She was released on a rumour cognizant. Some proud that Cindy's

[00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:04.400]
my guest tonight Wolsey sent an interview before the speech. She's made a difference in

[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:09.120]
the debate to bring our troops home from Iraq. Wolsey offered she an attick to the speech

[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:13.960]
gallery five, seat seven, row a. Earlier Tuesday while she was attending an alternative state

[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:18.240]
of the Union press conference by code pink, a group pushing for an end of the Iraq war. She

[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:21.620]
and Refton a bright pink scarf against the cold protested outside the White House with

[00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:25.560]
a handful of others before heading to the Capitol last night. There were no cameras around

[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:29.140]
but the small band faced the executive mansion repeatedly shouted, you're evicted, get

[00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:33.680]
out of our house. You're evicted. Meaning the Bushmeister. Now here's Cindy's response

[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:37.600]
to this story. What really happened, it's not very long but it gives you better, well

[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:42.180]
it is very long. Sorry. Got nothing but time. Do it. Yeah, kill it.

[00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:46.480]
Cindy she and his dear friends as most of you probably heard I was arrested before the

[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:50.440]
State of the Union address tonight. I'm speechless with fury at what happened and with

[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:54.080]
grief over what we've lost in our country. There have been lies from the police and

[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:58.500]
distorsions by the press. So this is what really happened. The Saturdays, the people stayed

[00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:01.740]
at the Union address in DC where I was joined by a comrade's persons, Lin Wolsey and John

[00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:06.260]
Camiers and right Malik Rahim and John Cavadol. Lin bought me a ticket at the State of

[00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:11.320]
the Union address. At the time I was drawing a shirt that said 2245 dead how many more.

[00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:15.080]
After the press conference I was having second thoughts about going to the State of the

[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:19.240]
Union, the Capitol. I didn't feel comfortable going. I knew George Bush would say things

[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:22.120]
that would hurt me and anger me. I knew that I couldn't disrupt the address because

[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:26.080]
Lin gave me the ticket I want to be disruptive out of respect for her. I in fact had given

[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:30.400]
the ticket to John Bruins who's in Iraq veterans against the war. Lin's office already called

[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:33.120]
the media and everyone knew I was going to be there so I sucked it up and went anyway.

[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:37.140]
I got the ticket back from John. I met one of Congresswoman Barbara Lee staffers in

[00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:40.300]
the Longworth Congressional Office building and we went to the Capitol via the underground

[00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:43.960]
tunnel. I went through the security once then had to use the restroom and went through

[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:49.080]
security again. My ticket was in the fifth gallery, front row, fourth seat in. The person

[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:53.660]
who in a few minutes was to arrest me helped me to my seat. I had just sat down with warm

[00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:57.040]
from climbing a few flights of stairs back up from the back room so I unsit my jacket.

[00:49:57.540 --> 00:50:01.580]
I turned to the right and take my left arm out when the same officer saw my shirt and

[00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:11.320]
the old protester. He then ran over to me, hauled me out of my seat and roughly with

[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:15.360]
my hands behind my back shoved me up the stairs. I said something like I'm going, you have

[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:19.660]
to be so rough by the way his name is Mike White. Wait, like Doug White the hockey player

[00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:23.700]
Mike White, we just got traded. The officer ran with me to the elevators yelling at

[00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:26.520]
everyone to move out of the way. When we got to the elevators he cuffed me and took me

[00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:30.600]
outside to wait a squad car on the way out. Someone behind me said that's Cindy Shean.

[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:34.620]
At which point the officer arrested me and said take these steps slowly. I said you

[00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:37.540]
don't care about being careful when you were dragging me up the other steps he said that's

[00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:40.960]
because you were protesting. While I get hauled out of the people's house because I was

[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:45.980]
protesting I was never told that I couldn't wear that shirt into the Congress. I was never

[00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:50.220]
asked to take it off as if my jacket back up. If I had been asked to do any of those things

[00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:55.680]
I would have and written about these suppression of freedom enough speech later. I was immediately

[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:59.180]
and roughly I have the bruises and muscles fastened to prove it hauled off and arrested for

[00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:04.060]
unlawful conduct. After I had my personal items inventory my fingers printed and my

[00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:08.900]
sergeant came in and looked at my shirt and said 20245 huh I just got back from there. I

[00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:12.120]
told them that my son died there that's on my the enormity of my loss hit me I have

[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:15.500]
lost my son I've lost my first amendment rights I've lost the country I love where did

[00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:20.560]
America go I started crying in pain what the case he died for what did the 20244 other

[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:24.140]
brave young Americans die for what are tens of thousands of them over there in harm's

[00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:27.740]
way for still for this I can't even wear a shirt that's got the number of troops out

[00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:32.020]
of the George Bushness Erigan ignorant policies are responsible for killing I wore the shirt

[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:35.060]
to make a statement the press knew I was going to be there and I thought every once in a

[00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:38.880]
while they would show me and I would have the shirt on I didn't wear it to be disrupted

[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:42.920]
or I would have unsaid my jacket during Bush's speech if I had any idea what happens to people

[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:47.280]
who wear shirts that make the neocons uncomfortable that I would be arrested maybe I wouldn't have

[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:51.820]
but I didn't there already have been many wild stories out there I have some lawyers looking

[00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:55.400]
into filing a first amendment lawsuit against the government for what happened tonight I'll

[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:59.480]
file it it's time to take our freedoms in our country back I don't want to live in a country

[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:02.900]
that prohibits any person whether he or she has paid the ultimate price for that country

[00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:07.120]
from wearing saying writing or telephoning any negative statements about the government that's

[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:10.640]
why I'm going to take my freedoms and liberties back that's why I'm not going to let Bush

[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:14.720]
code take anything else away from me or you I'm so appreciative of the couple hundred

[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:18.300]
protesters who came to the jail while I was knocked up to show their support we have so

[00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:22.540]
much potential for good there's so much good in so many people for our four hours and two

[00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:26.700]
jails after I was arrested I was let out again I'm so upset and sore it's hard to think straight

[00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:31.820]
keep up the struggle I promise I will too love and peace soon Cindy city sheen's response to her

uh wildlooned on the street yeah but the only got one head oh boy oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:38.180]
marine doubt says didn't see it coming again the White House should hire an anthropologist she says

[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:42.080]
corporations have begun having anthropologists to help them improve product designs and

[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:46.700]
interpret markets and clearly the Bushborne policy team doesn't understand any of the markets where

[00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:51.540]
it's barging around in Italy trying to sell America and democracy the brand value of America has

[00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:56.100]
been studied decline the state of the Union is sour but the state of the world is chilling thanks to

[00:54:56.100 --> 00:55:02.580]
a hideously ham-handed Bushborne policy crew that was once built as a seasoned dream team the more the

[00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:07.040]
White House tries to force be democracy to tempestuous parts of the world the more it discovers

[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:11.000]
that you may be able to spin and scare voters in the U.S. but the Middle East is not so easy to

[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:16.300]
manipulate W believes in self-determination only if he's doing the determining fundamentalist in

[00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:21.100]
America like to vote for Mr. Bush but elsewhere they're violently opposing him it's stunning that

[00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:25.380]
nearly four decades after Vietnam our government could be even more culturally illiterate and pig-headed

[00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:29.740]
the Bushes are more obsessed with snooping on Americans than fathoming how other cultures think and

[00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:35.120]
react one smart anthropologist reinforcing the idea that mirroring assuming other cultures think

[00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:39.640]
like us doesn't work would be a lot more helpful than all the discredited intelligence agencies that

[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:44.960]
are costing thirty billion dollars a year to miss everything from the breakup of the Soviet Union to

[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:54.920]
Enjoy.

[01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:13.100]
You did up to this penalty, being pretty familiar.

[01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:15.800]
Very timely, not amusing, not interesting.

[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:17.760]
Gee, dew like!

[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:22.740]
that's funny. But it goes on.

[01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:31.560]
Oh, right. Rock solid.

[01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:36.940]
Great. I noticed with great interest by the way that even though my name isn't mentioned

[01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:42.120]
on that great code text pool, that almost I would say 95% of the comments on there, maybe

[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:46.620]
90% of them mentioned my name. The last level of course in a highly derogatory way which

[01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:50.920]
just wounds me to the quick but nevertheless. Or if they don't, they're definitely our

[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:55.040]
misfits like Eddie. Well, we got Eddie who put, he only put it on about a hundred times.

[01:15:55.560 --> 01:16:00.020]
Babu. Babu. Babu. But it's good. So if you think our collars are great, take a look

[01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:04.240]
at the comments and a blog man. There is nothing that the worst talk show collars in history

[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:08.180]
believe me, we got more than our share. Don't even come close to the people who are responding

[01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:13.800]
to chat rooms and on the blogs. Oh my God. And of course we already learned that on our

[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:19.840]
website long ago, we nipped that baby in a bud. Just like those comments in there had

[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:23.360]
nothing to do with the pool or the question at hand. It's just a place for people to

[01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:27.500]
bitch and morn and scream at each other and back and forth. Like a bunch of overgrown

[01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:30.580]
chillin's. Like putting a plate of cat food out in the alley man. All these stuff like

[01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:36.740]
a bunch of overgrown chillin's. They're going to show up to it. 5 6 7 0 5 60. A lot of

[01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:41.160]
strays out there. A pound 5 60 and they've arrived in Singular Rivals line. Join us in our

[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:44.080]

Oh my God.

[01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:00.360]
It's you.

[01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:00.840]
Neil.

[01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:01.620]
You're right.

You got it. 5 6 7 0 5 60. That was a good clearance to an voice. Good job, too, by the way.

[01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:14.560]
Must have a sock over it.

[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:19.100]
Tom 5 60 and they've arrived in Singular Rivals line. The whisperer doing a voice today.

[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:20.460]
The whisperer.

[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:20.980]
Uh huh.

[01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:27.980]
You people are real scream. You know that the interesting part of it is the non-callers,

[01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:32.840]
the rest of the audience. They came for through for as big time yesterday and at pull 891 to

[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:36.100]
146 and at pull just just for us and for Q. I. M.

[01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:40.760]
Which I've told you that there's like about the same 10 people that call every day on all the shows.

[01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:45.180]
That's just this one. Oh, I did. And the rest of them have got enough sense to not to be doing stupid stuff like that.

[01:17:47.380 --> 01:17:47.740]
WNC.

[01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:48.200]
WNC.

[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:48.360]

[01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:50.880]
Yeah, Mr. Bellgiv, Johnson, Georgia, raise.

[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:52.360]

[01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:52.820]
WNC.

[01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:53.560]
Hello.

[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:54.540]
Yes, sir.

[01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:55.800]
Good morning, gentlemen.

[01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:56.460]
Uh huh.

[01:17:56.460 --> 01:17:57.420]
Many of the us some ago.

[01:17:57.960 --> 01:17:58.780]
Uh, thank you.

[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:01.600]
Thank you. Thank you.

[01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:01.740]

[01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:02.640]
Trying to be there.

[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:08.100]
I did very much into your about the congressman Bill Young, why was thrown out so.

[01:18:08.140 --> 01:18:10.400]
Yeah, I just got through we did about five minutes ago. Yes, sir.

[01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:13.000]
For wearing a t-shirt that said support our troops.

[01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:17.380]
But a beep, but a boop, but about and guess what? We just invaded a rack again.

[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:27.480]
567.056.505.60 in the Verizon Singular Wireless Line and Cindy Sheen got arrested and chickens are peeing all over the place and the killer bird for Jesus.

[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:32.100]
Because then birds are going to get us WQAM. Hello.

[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:34.060]
Any of you? Yes, sir.

[01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:39.220]
That guy that called in last week regarding man, this he's full of crap. Manon's never said that.

[01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:42.500]
About it is somebody that you like to be on from.

[01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:47.000]
Yeah, he said that anybody decides to know it would be an improvement in the two to six.

[01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:48.640]
Yeah, well, I got news for him.

[01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:52.800]
Mad, mad, if you think that we don't get along me in the mole, my sir or Hankin, mole.

[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:58.300]
Mad dog hates him like poison, but that's an anguished universal. Why should he be different for anybody else?

[01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:00.680]
You back the back with manage in your state.

[01:19:00.980 --> 01:19:06.660]
Let me say it again. As of the close of business yesterday, I don't really care what they do after two.

[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:11.480]
I'm just no longer involved. They can put Chinese mizurkas on. I just don't care.

[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:14.520]
Well, they were smart. They'd have you manage back the back.

[01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:17.200]
Yeah, but you hear what you just said if they were smart.

[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:18.320]
That's true.

[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:22.000]
We used to be back to back and he had gigantic. He would carry right on with the big numbers.

[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.620]
We had the ten to two, but I used to.

[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:26.640]
Used to and would have ensured of that.

[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:27.260]
That's based on heaven.

[01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:28.100]
Okay.

[01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:28.860]
All right.

[01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:32.400]
Get a little emotional about it.

[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:33.360]
The voice is cracking.

[01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:34.660]
Should have here.

[01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:36.220]
Let me say it again.

[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:40.880]
If they put on it, they put on elephants farting for however many are that.

[01:19:41.060 --> 01:19:41.360]
I said that.

[01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:45.360]
You can hear that because that's still in our format because Joyce makes sure we don't put that on here.

[01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:47.140]
So better sound like something.

[01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:48.860]
You guys are on your own. Okay. I did.

[01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:53.380]
Went to bat for yesterday and what I got in return was like a big fart in the face and that was in.

[01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:57.140]
Like whatever we do here, or we're going to go out of our way to ignore it.

[01:19:57.220 --> 01:19:58.980]
And we sure is how I'm going to get involved with that craft.

[01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:00.900]
So that's fine. That's okay.

[01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:03.120]
Be true to your station, man.

[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:05.740]
Remember that song about a beach boy's beach? Be true to your shoe? Well, they're not.

[01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:08.240]
They're not. They're all in Lala land.

[01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:10.340]
Somebody Q.A.M. Hello?

[01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:14.200]
Yes, sir.

[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:18.460]
Okay. Swarping, I don't understand is.

[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:21.400]
I don't understand, but so I'm going to be.

[01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:27.140]
Bill Moore said it right when he said I'm pissed off that most people aren't pissed off.

[01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:29.660]
But anyway, I don't understand.

[01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:31.140]
They don't care for most people who are stupid.

[01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:38.280]
Because most of those people that fly the banner support you on troops are in favor of keeping the troops over their dying.

[01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:41.700]
That's what I think support the troops means to get them the hell out of there.

[01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:43.100]
Like for something that matters.

[01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:46.820]
Well, that's what Cindy Sheen said and a lot of other people, but nevertheless what do they know?

[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:47.820]
But she's a commie.

[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:48.660]
There you go.

[01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:50.780]
Pinko. Anyway, Neil, I'm enclosing.

[01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:53.720]
Neil, I think they starved the election.

[01:20:55.700 --> 01:20:57.960]
If I sit down, well, he's been thinking about it for a while.

[01:20:58.020 --> 01:20:59.040]
He's finally come to that cartoon.

[01:20:59.740 --> 01:21:05.040]
If I sit down, oh, five sixty, let's get those valuable voting machines in infrared code text before it's too late over there to the hero.

[01:21:06.100 --> 01:21:08.580]
You're right, man. I just, I had like an epiphany,

[01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:11.360]
but the second one was the couple of months.

[01:21:11.580 --> 01:21:15.160]
Yeah, in fact, it popped right in my go with fat ass.

[01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:18.380]
I just, you know, there's nothing I can do.

[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:22.720]
I've done everything I can and if we get like a 15-year, if they get a one, that's their problem.

[01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:23.900]
You know, nothing I can do about it.

[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:26.980]
They will not listen to anything that we say from this show.

[01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:28.240]
It's just that we know nothing.

[01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:30.360]
We're the anti-sports crowd.

[01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:32.520]
We're the anti-social crowd. We're the evil ones.

[01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:34.880]
We're, see, we're sporting the party.

[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:35.780]
You do understand it.

[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:37.420]
I can't understand it for a long time.

[01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:41.520]
I mean, how many times when parents was like, you know, pretending to be whatever he was,

[01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:43.820]
did he come in there, oh, I, come on, do a sports show.

[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:45.980]
I would make a joke about doing a sports show.

[01:21:46.180 --> 01:21:47.140]
Oh, come on, do it, do it.

[01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:48.060]
Don't be great, do it.

[01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:51.600]
He would love nothing better than if I were to do it in a sports show every day.

[01:21:52.940 --> 01:21:58.860]
There's about as much chance that my start doing a sports show as there is a clearance to get in a brain between now and next circus.

[01:21:59.060 --> 01:22:00.500]
Okay, then ain't going to happen, sweetheart.

[01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:02.000]
Ain't going to happen.

[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:04.860]
But we do need to hear a lot more about it.

[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:08.040]
And if we love the Panthers, they're really great.

[01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:10.500]
Yeah. Thanks by the way, Herlanis, win the other night.

[01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:11.920]
Thank you very much.

[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.260]
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

[01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:15.120]
Froggy, Jacques Martain.

[01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:18.880]
Interesting how Otto was really kicking ass in the plane wide open now.

[01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:20.240]
Even under old B.M. this year.

[01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:22.480]
Anybody could coach that team, that team.

[01:22:23.420 --> 01:22:24.360]
Dominic Q.A.M. Hello.

[01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:25.720]
Hello.

[01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:26.500]
Yes, sir.

[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:31.480]
Are we able to watch that our leader last night on TV?

[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:32.640]
Were you able to stomach it?

[01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:36.160]
I saw about the last 10 minutes and I've cupped my guts up about an hour and a half.

[01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:37.020]
Unbelievable.

[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:40.240]
And although I cupped my guts at the Democratic response was even worse.

[01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:40.880]
Weep.

[01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:41.880]
Well, yeah, weep.

[01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:42.420]
That's the thing.

[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:43.800]
Yeah, sad part.

[01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:44.780]
That's the sad part.

[01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:46.060]
Unbelievable.

[01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:47.500]
I do have good news though.

[01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:49.540]
I am out of self-water this summer.

[01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:50.700]
I'm out of here finally.

[01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:52.300]
Congratulations, pal.

[01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:53.420]
Thank you, man.

[01:22:53.420 --> 01:22:57.400]
I won't even ask you where you're going because no matter where it is, you could be go to the Okie-Fenoki Swap.

[01:22:57.420 --> 01:22:58.300]
It would be a major improvement.

[01:22:59.460 --> 01:23:00.280]
Well, that's true.

[01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:01.220]
Good luck to me.

[01:23:01.660 --> 01:23:02.440]
Thank you, too, man.

[01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:02.820]
All right.

[01:23:03.340 --> 01:23:03.660]
Oh, yeah.

[01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:04.320]
I'm out.

[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:06.480]
I'm honest to goodness.

[01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:08.020]
I mean, and I'll say it again.

[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:09.180]
This show has been a barometer.

[01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:10.220]
A lot of people resent it.

[01:23:10.300 --> 01:23:10.980]
Oh, no, you're wrong.

[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:11.920]
You just have a bunch of idiots.

[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:12.220]
No.

[01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:13.800]
Well, I mean, yeah, no one.

[01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:13.820]

[01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:13.960]
Yes.

[01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:15.720]
It's a barometer.

[01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:21.420]
It's like taking the temperatures, like sticking a thermometer in your zone, taking the temperature of where the community.

[01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:25.040]
And this show has been an accurate reflection of self-order for years and years.

[01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:27.980]
And every time I come back to town, it's worse and worse.

[01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:32.260]
And I look around, I see these people driving, and I say, who are they and what are they?

[01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:33.200]
And what are they thinking about?

[01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:34.520]
And of course, they're not.

[01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:36.480]
What is this all about?

[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:38.880]
Oh, postal killer may have shot a neighbor before the spree.

[01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:40.720]
Aren't you concerned about that postal thing?

[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:41.080]
No.

[01:23:41.540 --> 01:23:42.260]
Aren't you going postal?

[01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:42.860]
Yes.

[01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:45.140]
I am, because I'm looking at the Rushland Buzz wife.

[01:23:46.100 --> 01:23:46.380]
I'm not.

[01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:47.520]
5.670.

[01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:48.040]
5.60.

[01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:48.580]
Good choice.

[01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:50.140]
How's that poll coming by the way?

[01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:51.100]
Let's get heavy on that poll.

[01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:52.420]
We've done this about a thousand times.

[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:56.140]
I'm talking about our poll, not that other piece of third.

[01:23:57.180 --> 01:24:00.220]
Who is the biggest no-tellance celebrity of all time?

[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:01.480]

[01:24:02.820 --> 01:24:03.680]
Paraselton to 18.

[01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:06.140]

Yes.

[01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:08.940]
Rosie O'Donnell 57.

[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:10.220]
I hate this poll 55.

[01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:11.500]
I've actually sent you 48.

[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:12.680]
P.B.D. 48.

[01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:13.620]

[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:18.560]

[01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:19.560]
I want to say Tom Willing.

[01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:20.360]

[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:24.360]
He's running Arnold's ass.

[01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:26.100]
Our city of Hall 13.

[01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:26.920]

[01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:29.800]
No talent, Dike.

[01:24:30.380 --> 01:24:30.880]
I mean none.

[01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:32.860]

Snoop Dogg 10.

[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:38.380]
Can he belt one out or not?

[01:24:39.740 --> 01:24:40.720]

[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:41.540]

[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:51.280]
Do you remember the Hank City enjoy the way Newton show in Vegas?

[01:24:52.100 --> 01:24:52.200]
No.

[01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:55.240]
Hank must have his blood sugar must have been way out of kilter that night.

[01:24:55.900 --> 01:24:57.260]
Wuppie Goldberg in Madonna 6.

Bob Dylan 4.

[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:04.580]
Probably Bob Dylan shouldn't have been on there because at least he wrote some great music.

[01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:06.760]
He couldn't sing but had somebody else sing in four.

[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:07.460]
That's right.

[01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:10.060]

And none for Tab Hunter.

[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:14.020]
Hey Tab!

[01:25:14.180 --> 01:25:14.680]
You're fairy.

[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:16.080]
Dean Martin or Bruce Willis?

[01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:19.240]
I would have thought Dean Martin was start moving up the list after he played some of an

[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:20.920]
infant fantastic or clip.

[01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:22.500]
You would have thought but no.

[01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:23.780]
Nothing for Dean.

[01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:28.200]
I think since they turned on Jerry Lewis they kind of like tuned him out of their brain.

[01:25:28.740 --> 01:25:29.060]
Dean Martin.

[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:31.620]

The American Media stood up and took notice when the improvised explosive device in IED

[01:26:44.580 --> 01:26:47.340]
regressally injured in ABC Newscrew on Sunday.

[01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:51.560]
In Iraq and throughout the military, there are sympathy and concern for anchor Bob Woodruff

[01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:52.620]
and cameraman Doug Volt.

[01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:55.500]
It could Canadian boy by the way Doug Volt, but there's also this question.

[01:26:56.460 --> 01:27:00.140]
Why do you think this is such a huge story, wrote in office or stationed in Bakuba, Iraq,

[01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:01.160]
Monday via email?

[01:27:01.620 --> 01:27:05.000]
It's a bit stunning to us over here on absolutely dominant stories on every network

[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:05.700]
in front page.

[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:08.480]
I mean, you think we lost the entire first marine division or something.

[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:12.000]
There's a lot of grumbling from guys that all rights about it, he writes.

[01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:15.780]
That's a really impolite and impolite thing to say, but it's what you would hear over

[01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:16.020]
here.

[01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:22.160]
At least 2245 troops had died in Iraq since the war started 1753 of them killed in action.

[01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:26.680]
Another 16,000 have been injured half of them seriously enough to require evacuations

[01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:27.360]
in the battlefield.

[01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:32.620]
According to the Pentagon, 60% of deaths are the result of IEDs, which have injured more

[01:27:32.620 --> 01:27:35.100]
than 9200 troops, nine times more than gunshots.

[01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:39.060]
The point that's currently being made is that the press folks are more important than mere

[01:27:39.060 --> 01:27:42.320]
military folks, a senior military official told UPI yesterday.

[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:45.140]
The unavoidable consequence of war is this.

[01:27:45.700 --> 01:27:47.380]
People are savagely wounded and killed.

[01:27:47.780 --> 01:27:51.080]
Soldiers in Iraq watching the coverage on satellite TV and reading the news on the internet

[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:54.040]
are getting the impression that the press has only just discovered this fact.

[01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:55.140]
Well, haven't they?

[01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:57.720]
It's not quite as simple as that.

[01:27:57.780 --> 01:28:01.140]
Of course, military personnel often express frustration that the media harps on military

[01:28:01.140 --> 01:28:04.820]
casualty reports at the expense of what they consider their successes in Iraq.

[01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:09.080]
However, as it prompted, it promoted its story on Woodruff and Vote Monday evening,

[01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:13.420]
the local ABC News affiliate in Washington showed a montage of exploding vehicles in Iraq,

[01:28:13.420 --> 01:28:17.320]
footage called largely from insurgents, who videotaped the attacks and post them on websites

[01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:19.700]
to advertise or magnify their successes.

[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:25.140]
The families of the 76 troops killed in 533 wounded in action in Iraq from the District

[01:28:25.140 --> 01:28:28.560]
of Columbia, Virginia and Maryland might say the war had already come home.

[01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:33.080]
It's just a bit frustrating to see something so dramatized that happens every day to some

[01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:37.220]
20-year-old American or worse to 10-30-year-old Iraqis or cops alongside us.

[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:40.980]
Some of the stories don't even mention Iraqi casualties in this attack as if they're meaningless

[01:28:40.980 --> 01:28:42.500]
or with the officer in Bakuba.

[01:28:43.620 --> 01:28:47.000]
Captain Montgomery, a professor at American University School of Communication, has been

[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:47.980]
thinking the same thing.

[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:51.520]
When you see the kind of coverage the story is getting, it draws attention to the lack of

[01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:53.920]
coverage that hundreds of cases don't get, said Montgomery.

[01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:57.740]
Having a personal connection to someone injured or killed on the battlefield is relatively

[01:28:57.740 --> 01:28:59.360]
a rare experience for journalists.

[01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:02.240]
Fewer than 1% of the US population is part of the military.

[01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:04.120]
Very few reporters have served.

[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:07.020]
The war is comfortably distant until a fellow journalist is affected.

[01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:08.160]
It could have been you.

[01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:09.280]
It could have been me, we think.

[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:12.760]
The full way the war is hard to comprehend until it happens to you or someone you know

[01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:13.580]
or someone like you.

[01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:16.340]
Incidents like the serious wounding of Woodruff are rare.

[01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:19.300]
It's never happening forward to any anchor person for any of the US TV networks.

[01:29:19.780 --> 01:29:22.240]
Consequently, it had a significant event for a value.

[01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:23.060]
News value.

[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:26.400]
But many journalists have been injured and killed covering the current conflict in Iraq.

[01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:30.500]
According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 61 have died from hostile actions since March

[01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:31.280]
2003.

[01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:33.660]
Many of them are Iraqi or Arab and therefore unfamiliar.

[01:29:34.580 --> 01:29:38.200]
That compares to 66 journalists killed during the entire Vietnam War, currently Freedom

[01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:38.480]
Form.

[01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:44.520]
Now, who was David Bloom from NBC News that used to work on Channel 4 down there?

[01:29:44.820 --> 01:29:45.360]
That sounds about right.

[01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:45.900]
That's right.

[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.820]
He died from a like a heart blood clot.

[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:49.180]
Yeah.

[01:29:49.580 --> 01:29:49.920]
Yeah.

[01:29:49.940 --> 01:29:50.680]
Sit where you are.

[01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:53.440]
And that was a long time ago.

[01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:55.740]
That was after that whole business about the embedded.

[01:29:55.980 --> 01:30:01.100]
He embedded the prop propaganda spreading embedded the journalists because he had walked around

[01:30:01.100 --> 01:30:01.420]
a mover.

[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:04.500]
And March and Weston there, he got that clot and all of a sudden about a being and that

[01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:04.980]
was in to him.

[01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:08.520]
Total needlessly, totally and again.

[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:12.220]
And when I watched, I only did watch the last ten minutes and I wasn't going to watch

[01:30:12.220 --> 01:30:12.620]
any of it.

[01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:16.820]
But I watched the Democrats, you know, after the Republicans, we got like, every time

[01:30:16.820 --> 01:30:19.000]
Bush farted or like a reason I brought it.

[01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:22.960]
And here the Democrats very reluctantly, but all standing up to just to make sure that

[01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:26.360]
the camera saw that they weren't there, you know, only a couple of times from what I

[01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:27.020]
was heard.

[01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:30.160]
And they said afterward because I didn't watch the earlier part, only a couple of times

[01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:31.040]
that they not stand up.

[01:30:31.820 --> 01:30:33.460]
Like we said, let's kill all the fags.

[01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:34.000]
They didn't stand up.

[01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:34.800]
That was bad for business.

[01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:38.780]
Or it's like, you know, let all the, you're talking with people started it.

[01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:39.660]
They didn't stand up for that.

[01:30:41.860 --> 01:30:43.100]
Then make you want to puke.

[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:43.620]
Yeah.

[01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:44.920]
No balls, baby.

[01:30:45.220 --> 01:30:46.300]
That's the problem in this world.

[01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:47.340]
So few people would ball.

[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:51.060]
That's why people like Cindy Sheen and Michael Moore, they get to trash all the time.

[01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:52.160]
You know, a smear and smear.

[01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:53.200]
Oh, they're communist.

[01:30:53.540 --> 01:30:54.920]
They're sympathizing with the enemy.

[01:30:55.180 --> 01:30:56.160]
Just smear and smear, man.

[01:30:56.280 --> 01:30:56.760]
Anybody's God.

[01:30:56.800 --> 01:30:57.640]
There's to open up their mouth.

[01:30:57.960 --> 01:30:58.360]
Paul and Neil.

[01:30:58.440 --> 01:30:58.840]
Same thing.

[01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:03.500]
Oh, we use the classified documents in that book is we're going to send him to death

[01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:04.060]
Roa.

[01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:05.840]
Shut him up real fast.

[01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:09.480]
5 6 7 0 5 60.

[01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:12.740]
We're having our very intellectual discussion about the president and the state of the

[01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:16.320]
Union and rest in a very weak, weak need democratic response last night.

[01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:17.080]
We're going to break it down.

[01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:20.140]
Democratic response was very much like the QAM sports crew.

[01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:22.560]
Impotent.

[01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:24.740]
Somebody QAM?

[01:31:24.780 --> 01:31:24.940]
Hello.

[01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:25.960]
Hey, Neil.

[01:31:26.060 --> 01:31:26.460]
How you doing, man?

[01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:27.300]
All right, Pali.

[01:31:27.940 --> 01:31:31.560]
Yeah, actually, I was calling in at the same time that I was talking to the one that's

[01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:32.260]
leaving South Florida.

[01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:35.340]
Yeah, I was calling in and telling you the exact same thing.

[01:31:35.460 --> 01:31:35.900]
I'm out of here.

[01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:36.640]
Excellent.

[01:31:37.580 --> 01:31:40.680]
Yeah, born and raised in Hollywood and I'm 29 years old.

[01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:41.980]
I was 29 years too long.

[01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:44.580]
Yeah, you're here about 50 years too young to be living there.

[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:46.820]
I'm out of here, man.

[01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:47.800]
Get my family out of here.

[01:31:48.100 --> 01:31:48.620]
Good luck, Pali.

[01:31:49.100 --> 01:31:49.460]
Thanks a lot.

[01:31:49.780 --> 01:31:50.040]
Thanks.

[01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:50.540]
Congratulations.

[01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:51.820]
People getting out there.

[01:31:51.900 --> 01:31:53.680]
They can smell the daffodils, man.

[01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:54.940]
Oh, it's a smell of death.

[01:31:54.940 --> 01:31:56.680]
Especially in Hollywood where he is.

[01:31:57.300 --> 01:31:58.140]
Well, you're in Hollywood.

[01:31:58.360 --> 01:31:59.060]
Can you smell the death?

[01:31:59.340 --> 01:32:00.360]
Depends on which way the wind's blowing.

[01:32:01.740 --> 01:32:02.500]
Oh, man.

[01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:04.180]
Oh, I don't want to see that.

[01:32:04.180 --> 01:32:05.700]
I pray that women should continue at any depressive.

[01:32:05.700 --> 01:32:06.900]
You said that big pooping there?

[01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:08.300]
No, I was a chocolate pooping.

[01:32:08.340 --> 01:32:10.680]
Listen, I cannot stand the sight of Mrs. Lindblom.

[01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:11.140]
Oh, that's right.

[01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:11.940]
Let me turn over to the MSNBC.

[01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:15.400]
OK, they probably got somebody more palatable on there.

[01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:16.720]
In fact, what are they showing?

[01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:17.440]
Broken borders.

[01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:20.420]
They're showing all of them illegal aliens pouring across illegal aliens.

[01:32:20.860 --> 01:32:21.740]
I do like those comments.

[01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:24.220]
That was also an last part I've seen last night.

[01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:25.560]
I didn't see any part of it.

[01:32:25.700 --> 01:32:25.920]
Thank you.

[01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:27.280]
Well, I saw only the last 10 minutes.

[01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:28.940]
And once I turned it on, I was only...

[01:32:28.940 --> 01:32:33.440]
The only reason I stayed with it is because I was curious to see the response of the peanut

[01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:34.040]
gallery there.

[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:36.220]
And I should have liked...

[01:32:37.140 --> 01:32:37.980]
Although he made...

[01:32:37.980 --> 01:32:40.840]
Just as I was turning on, he made some comment about me and Bill Clinton.

[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.680]
You know, when they showed Hillary and she had kind of like...

[01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:44.900]
Like she just smelled a bad fart that kind of looked on her face.

[01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:46.980]
You mean that what she always has?

[01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:48.280]
Yeah, that's...

[01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:48.760]
Yeah, exactly.

[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:49.300]
That's the one.

[01:32:49.380 --> 01:32:50.380]
Like that real sour look.

[01:32:50.900 --> 01:32:52.960]
Like some 600 pound chocolate leaf.

[01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:54.100]
And he just farted in front of her.

[01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:55.360]
Ooh, like that.

[01:32:57.060 --> 01:33:01.740]
560-705-60 pound 5-60 or maybe she wasn't pounded time worth a QA and that might have had

[01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:02.360]
something to do with it.

[01:33:02.600 --> 01:33:03.800]
Have that sour look on your face?

[01:33:05.540 --> 01:33:06.220]
WQAM, hello.

[01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:07.440]
Hi, Neil.

[01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:07.960]
How are you doing?

[01:33:08.300 --> 01:33:08.600]
Okay.

[01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:11.040]
I just want to thank you, if I may.

[01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:11.620]
Welcome.

[01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:18.680]
And forming me of the news and what's going on in the real world out there because I just

[01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:20.380]
can't stomach watching it on TV.

[01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:22.200]
You're listening it.

[01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:25.220]
You know, it's just you, you're it.

[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:25.820]
You're the...

[01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:28.400]
I'm in the source, baby.

[01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:29.560]
I'm in the source and we're...

[01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:32.340]
I hate that thing.

[01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:34.020]
I am going to be on 24-7.

[01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:35.440]
I'm going to be on 26-8.

[01:33:35.580 --> 01:33:36.120]
How do you like that?

[01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:45.900]
Well, now because you definitely deserve your well vacations and all the pain you have, but I've been listening to you for 20 years.

[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:46.560]
Wow.

[01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:48.000]
I have to say I get...

[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.380]
Get most of it for you.

[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.760]
A lot of good stuff, a lot of bad stuff to need to hear.

[01:33:53.180 --> 01:33:53.520]
And...

[01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:54.760]
We need to hear the bad stuff.

[01:33:55.260 --> 01:33:58.560]
Yeah, but there's to be a lot more symbi-cans out there for sure.

[01:33:58.680 --> 01:33:59.640]
You said it, honey.

[01:33:59.780 --> 01:34:00.320]
You said it.

[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:03.380]
I just don't understand why these people are poor or anything.

[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:04.560]
I just...

[01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:06.360]
I'm baffled.

[01:34:06.820 --> 01:34:10.640]
But also, somebody with no talent and it was just a disgusting pig.

[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:11.940]
I can't figure it out.

[01:34:12.540 --> 01:34:13.700]
It's corny blood.

[01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:15.140]
I just...

[01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:16.760]
Maybe it's a guy.

[01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:17.440]
I don't know.

[01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:18.820]
What are you doing?

[01:34:19.260 --> 01:34:19.620]
You...

[01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:19.940]
I...

[01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:21.820]
We have Courtney Cox out there, but not Courtney Love.

[01:34:22.220 --> 01:34:23.440]
So let's put Courtney Love on her.

[01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:25.100]
Get that out there, Josh Wright-O-Waiters one.

[01:34:25.220 --> 01:34:26.700]
She was a disgusting pig.

[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:27.300]
Amen.

[01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:29.660]
And thank you again for...

[01:34:29.660 --> 01:34:31.280]
Courtney Love, now she's got her nose for news.

[01:34:33.060 --> 01:34:33.780]
Oh, yeah.

[01:34:34.220 --> 01:34:36.060]
I want to be on your nose for a second.

[01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:36.440]
Exactly.

[01:34:36.780 --> 01:34:37.260]
Have a great day.

[01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:39.240]
Maybe she's the one that's farted in front of Hillary last night.

[01:34:39.380 --> 01:34:39.840]
Have a great day.

[01:34:40.860 --> 01:34:45.060]
566-705-60, pound 5-60 in the Verizon Singular Wireless Lime.

[01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:48.440]
We're just rolling along, taking 4,000, 5,000 calls every day now.

[01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:49.700]
That's my new deal.

[01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:50.340]
All right.

[01:34:50.740 --> 01:34:51.780]
Get a lot of these calls in here.

[01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:56.520]
Now, he's stupid as, sitting here, telling time reading a newspaper articles on the air.

[01:34:57.100 --> 01:35:00.140]
And those intellectual people from across the street, they don't want to hear that.

[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:01.760]
Of course, they are listening, but they...

[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:03.900]
You know, they're going to be shutting them off like my old mailman, Rick.

[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:05.060]
They're reaching for the dial right now.

[01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:07.020]
They can't quite reach it or the dial either.

[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:08.320]
They're reaching for it.

[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:10.940]
Who the hell are you people kidding?

[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:12.440]
God.

[01:35:13.020 --> 01:35:18.040]
And the proof of the pudding is that yesterday, you can be damn sure that the Jews imposed in the Frittata and Omelet.

[01:35:18.460 --> 01:35:19.820]
They were banging away too on that poll.

[01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:22.700]
And they got 146 votes to our 891.

[01:35:22.980 --> 01:35:23.640]
They really...

[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:25.580]
And that's probably the whole audience who voted twice.

[01:35:26.580 --> 01:35:27.460]
Who are they kidding?

[01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:30.540]
But, yes, you know, they're feeling their oats and they're thinking,

[01:35:30.700 --> 01:35:31.760]
Hey, that roggers.

[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:33.380]
He said they're throwing in the towel over there.

[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:34.340]
We really...

[01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:34.700]
Yeah, right.

[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:36.720]
I feel you, Rick.

[01:35:36.740 --> 01:35:37.420]
And they are.

[01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:38.140]
They are.

[01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:42.280]
And Clarence has said, and they're having George come and explain to him what...

[01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:43.800]
You know, who's on first and what's it all about?

[01:35:44.100 --> 01:35:45.160]
That was...

[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:45.920]
You can ask Josh.

[01:35:46.060 --> 01:35:47.620]
I kept asking, what is he in there for?

[01:35:47.740 --> 01:35:48.440]
What is that all about?

[01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:49.420]
Just talking...

[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:51.320]
Talking crap, man.

[01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:52.220]
Talking trash.

[01:35:53.740 --> 01:35:57.200]
You could be talking to the janitor and have a more intellectual radio conversation.

[01:35:57.640 --> 01:36:00.040]
You're talking about radio, not about sports.

[01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:01.140]
Don't you understand the difference?

[01:36:01.420 --> 01:36:04.160]
You're talking about broadcasting, broadcasting, like Lanyl Mottens.

[01:36:05.140 --> 01:36:08.960]
Broadcasting, like Mike Rosenthal, broadcasting, like Gilbert, a broadcasting.

[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:11.120]
That's it.

[01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:13.620]
So I got to do it ball games.

[01:36:13.780 --> 01:36:15.040]
Now what's I got to do with the Super Bowl?

[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:18.120]
And most importantly, what the hell has it got to do with that?

[01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:21.360]
With that big-headed goofball, huh?

[01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:23.540]
Got it.

[01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:26.360]
His head is bigger than some planets in the solar system.

[01:36:26.620 --> 01:36:29.200]
I guarantee you, I will guarantee you when that damn thing they sent up,

[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:32.260]
it's going to take nine years to get there and it's going to cost billions of dollars already.

[01:36:32.260 --> 01:36:35.060]
When that gets to Pluto, they're going to see it's just the size of Shack's head.

[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:36.340]
Oh, it's bigger than your anus.

[01:36:36.700 --> 01:36:37.800]
And that's what you think.

[01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:39.720]
You ain't seen my anus lately.

[01:36:40.420 --> 01:36:41.220]
Has it gotten bigger?

[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:41.920]
No.

[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:43.800]
Who is it?

[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:46.080]
W-Q-Y-M, hello.

[01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:50.100]
Hello, have you heard the little house there show on the series?

[01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:52.500]
W-Q-Y-M, hello.

[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:55.160]
Talk about stale news.

[01:36:56.520 --> 01:36:57.120]
Q-Y-M.

[01:36:57.400 --> 01:36:59.340]
There's no mow on the outfankin show.

[01:37:00.060 --> 01:37:01.060]
W-Q-Y-M, hello.

[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:04.200]
Q-Y-M, hello.

[01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:04.980]
Q-Y-M, hello.

[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:06.960]
Yes, behind my name is James.

[01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:10.980]
I'm calling about your we need actual salespeople who can actually sell advertisements.

[01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:11.420]
You got it?

[01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:12.700]
You got it heard?

[01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:14.520]
Who can actually sell advertising?

[01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:15.620]
I don't think we have any of those.

[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:16.440]
Thank you.

[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:17.100]
Well, you're good.

[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:19.700]
Yeah, we are every day.

[01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:20.260]
That's a matter of fact.

[01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:22.360]
Yeah, James, every day we're hiring.

[01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:26.040]
Okay, if we just hired 75 people who are voting the bitch,

[01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:28.940]
they find young lady from the Ford Mercy Viral Beach,

[01:37:29.460 --> 01:37:33.900]
who told me that she used to sell my show when I was on a station up there in Viral Beach.

[01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:35.740]
That she sold you, chunks of you.

[01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:36.420]

[01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:37.900]
No, that's what she said this morning.

[01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:40.220]
She used to sell my show when I was on her station in Viral Beach.

[01:37:40.220 --> 01:37:42.580]
I said, honey, I was never, yeah, in Viral Beach.

[01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:46.160]
It's not exactly my idea of what I'm shooting for, you know.

[01:37:46.380 --> 01:37:48.320]
Well, maybe it was when you were syndicated in Viral Beach.

[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:50.360]
Oh, you never, never syndicated there.

[01:37:50.620 --> 01:37:54.700]
And it took me about 10 times to convince her, hey, I was not on your station lady.

[01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:55.860]
You never sold my show.

[01:37:55.860 --> 01:37:57.840]
You haven't got a clue what you're talking about.

[01:37:58.100 --> 01:37:59.980]
And there wasn't an on your station, okay?

[01:38:00.060 --> 01:38:01.160]
Maybe she's in the other deal right now.

[01:38:01.420 --> 01:38:02.080]
I'm sure it was.

[01:38:02.420 --> 01:38:02.860]
I am, right.

[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:04.120]
Could have been the other deal right now.

[01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:05.000]
Probably Neil Boards.

[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:08.240]
You know, Neil Boards, do they?

[01:38:08.780 --> 01:38:09.860]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:11.900]
Listen, he's Democrat.

[01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:13.720]
Just call some medicine, earth.

[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:15.100]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:15.820]
Hey, Neil.

[01:38:16.300 --> 01:38:16.580]
Yes, sir.

[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:19.700]
Is there a drill bit, small enough to drill a glory hole for you?

[01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:22.160]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:24.020]
They have drilled this.

[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:25.520]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:26.740]
Hey, Neil.

[01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:27.600]
Yes, sir.

[01:38:28.340 --> 01:38:29.820]
Martha Stewart on your pole.

[01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:31.200]
Martha Stewart, man.

[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:32.960]
She got the talent or what?

[01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:37.220]
Neil, to this day, I swear I couldn't tell you what the hell she's known for other than just being fake.

[01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:40.980]
She's known for baking cookies and going to do her cookies.

[01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:41.360]
You're her cookies, I didn't say.

[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:42.280]
Sugar cookies, you know.

[01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:43.500]
That's not funny.

[01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:44.020]
Good choice.

[01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:47.760]
Okay, and that's sure her is that you're fired at it, Martha.

[01:38:47.980 --> 01:38:48.400]
How long now?

[01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:49.100]
That's about five minutes.

[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:49.660]
Yes, she got fired.

[01:38:49.660 --> 01:38:50.140]
You're not here.

[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:50.700]
Huh?

[01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:53.520]
She got fired at it.

[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:54.920]
You fired it, Martha.

[01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:55.440]
You're out.

[01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:56.880]
Go back to the wheel.

[01:38:57.100 --> 01:38:58.380]
Do not pass a code.

[01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:00.460]
Do not collect 200 cookies whenever.

[01:39:00.740 --> 01:39:01.640]
Cut it.

[01:39:01.740 --> 01:39:02.220]
Cut it.

[01:39:02.220 --> 01:39:03.620]
Hey, in fact, I'll tell you another one.

[01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:04.160]
That's Oprah.

[01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:07.840]
Speaking of that nice book club she's got going.

[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:08.800]
All I'm phony.

[01:39:09.100 --> 01:39:14.020]
Oh, I didn't know when I filled the trade and all your stupid housewives out there that listen to the crap.

[01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:20.700]
Man, and that right there, that should tell you all you need to know about America is the fallen at that bitch's guy.

[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:21.080]
Doesn't matter.

[01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:23.520]
It's just like when the priests get busted with their hands down the kids pants.

[01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:25.740]
Oh, it was just an, you know, isolated incident.

[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:26.740]
Faith, faith, people.

[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:27.360]
Let me say it again.

[01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:30.260]
All your parents out there don't press your kids to a guy to wear his address.

[01:39:30.460 --> 01:39:33.340]
I could be dream of when I tell you that, but that's just my feeling of love.

[01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:34.720]
That area you know about.

[01:39:35.140 --> 01:39:37.120]
Yeah, I know all about that stuff.

[01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:39.160]
WQAM, hello.

[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:46.100]
And when you say that area, are you talking about between the public and the need, the solicited area?

[01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:46.720]
QAM.

[01:39:47.100 --> 01:39:47.420]
QAM.

[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:47.760]

[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:47.840]
Hello.

[01:39:48.540 --> 01:39:50.380]
Yeah, so we're super tired.

[01:39:51.580 --> 01:39:52.200]
WQAM, hello.

[01:39:54.340 --> 01:39:55.820]
Oh, we haven't heard from him in a long time.

[01:39:56.460 --> 01:39:57.040]
WQAM, hello.

[01:39:57.480 --> 01:40:00.120]
We're broke back now and the gay agenda's being set in motion.

[01:40:01.740 --> 01:40:03.160]
You better get used to it, Valley.

[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:04.840]
Get the lotion for your motion.

[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:06.200]
WQAM, hello.

[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:07.780]
Dance to it, man.

[01:40:09.420 --> 01:40:10.320]
Now, now that's bad.

[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:11.340]
Oh, we're fried.

[01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:11.940]
I didn't like that.

[01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:13.660]
Maybe Danny's the one of his relatives listening.

[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:14.800]
He's coming up with dance to it.

[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:15.940]
Yeah, dance to it, died.

[01:40:15.940 --> 01:40:17.800]
Okay, it happens to the worst of us.

[01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:18.740]
He's dead.

[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:20.760]
We won't be hearing from him no more.

[01:40:20.860 --> 01:40:21.940]
Well, actually, we're fine.

[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:22.780]
We're fine.

[01:40:22.780 --> 01:40:24.560]
He said that's a good thing we memorialized him with that.

[01:40:24.660 --> 01:40:25.400]
Oh, we're fine.

[01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:28.860]
Just like the guy that said, he's been dead for years now.

[01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:29.640]
And then he died.

[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:33.520]
He said that and then he looked up to his promise.

[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:35.160]
He died up to his promise.

[01:40:36.460 --> 01:40:37.100]
WQAM, hello.

[01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:38.500]
Neil.

[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:39.600]
Yes, I am.

[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:41.940]
Hey, in response to your...

[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:44.880]
And I'm just here to say, everybody's still alive.

[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:45.680]
Yeah.

[01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:47.540]
You know what's the scratchy voice?

[01:40:48.140 --> 01:40:49.660]
Yeah, I know Larry Bach's box.

[01:40:49.900 --> 01:40:51.180]
That's how Larry answered the phone.

[01:40:51.380 --> 01:40:52.900]
Yeah, he's still doing good.

[01:40:53.460 --> 01:40:53.940]
Well, that's good.

[01:40:54.620 --> 01:40:57.180]
I told him you were at the bottom of the other day in the show.

[01:40:57.300 --> 01:40:58.740]
Now, you want to learn his boyfriends or what?

[01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:00.280]
No, no, no, none of that.

[01:41:00.740 --> 01:41:01.000]
Okay.

[01:41:01.540 --> 01:41:02.500]
All right, okay, baby.

[01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:02.640]
Yeah.

[01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:03.300]
Okay, thanks.

[01:41:03.740 --> 01:41:05.040]
Larry Bach's just still has good ears.

[01:41:05.820 --> 01:41:06.720]
Best regards, Larry.

[01:41:07.140 --> 01:41:07.460]
Bach's.

[01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:09.160]
He just got a gravely voice.

[01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:09.640]
That's all.

[01:41:09.940 --> 01:41:10.640]
One of those things.

[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:11.360]
He's a good guy.

[01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:12.900]
Never stole a freight train.

[01:41:14.740 --> 01:41:16.140]
How many votes we got on our poll?

[01:41:16.420 --> 01:41:16.880]
You know something?

[01:41:17.020 --> 01:41:18.860]
It's a relief that I don't have to keep going back and checking

[01:41:18.860 --> 01:41:19.800]
that stupid other thing.

[01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:21.200]
And there was a lot of work yesterday.

[01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:22.560]
And I thought I had a cup of something.

[01:41:22.700 --> 01:41:23.580]
I was all...

[01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:25.140]
See, then there's the thing that was deflating.

[01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:26.840]
It was deflating because I felt like,

[01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:28.640]
man, we should have put them in an air place.

[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:29.760]
We kicked their ass.

[01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:34.940]
We were handing the baton off there to the bullmeister at two with his big and mookow

[01:41:34.940 --> 01:41:38.340]
in front of the university, Doug, and thinking, man, oh, man, we're going to just

[01:41:38.340 --> 01:41:39.760]
paste a wall with our ass.

[01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:41.740]
And then that was the end of that.

[01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:48.380]
And throughout the day, I'd come in here in the 8.91 turned into like 903 and 905.

[01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:53.580]
And there 146 turned into like 357 and 5.28 and said,

[01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:56.080]
and I'm thinking, there's something that I'm not going on over there.

[01:41:56.180 --> 01:41:56.560]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:41:57.600 --> 01:41:58.720]
Somebody dropped the balls.

[01:41:59.460 --> 01:42:01.920]
Well, in night and while they're wasting their time plugging that poll,

[01:42:02.220 --> 01:42:04.580]
we were doing important things.

[01:42:05.420 --> 01:42:06.180]
Yeah, that's right.

[01:42:06.780 --> 01:42:07.540]
And what else?

[01:42:07.540 --> 01:42:09.400]
And don't forget about that Super Bowl.

[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:11.900]
This is Neil Rogers.

[01:42:12.380 --> 01:42:16.520]
Set a Homeland Security Tom Ridge, advising you to put duct tape on your radio

[01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:20.620]
when I raised the warning color to Bing for the Neil Rogers 12-to-1 hour.

[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:24.940]
Give Grandma a grandpa the gift of today's hottest music with Senior Bob.

[01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:26.260]
I got no mind.

[01:42:26.420 --> 01:42:29.180]
I used to use a golden age and come streamer too.

[01:42:29.380 --> 01:42:30.900]
Imagine when the brookies are seen.

[01:42:31.100 --> 01:42:33.960]
Your Bob features the greatest hits sung by the greatest generation.

[01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:39.420]
I walk this empty strip on the boulevard home broken.

[01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:43.860]
Senior Bob covers all your favorite artists like that wicker snapper M&M.

[01:42:44.020 --> 01:42:49.000]
Those catchy Nancy boys winked 182 and those brazen young hussies, the pussy cat dolls.

[01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:50.380]
Don't show it, Charlie.

[01:42:50.660 --> 01:42:51.260]
Life rides.

[01:42:51.460 --> 01:42:52.580]
Hush like me.

[01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:53.940]
Don't show.

[01:42:54.860 --> 01:42:56.040]
We're gonna show.

[01:42:56.640 --> 01:42:58.420]
Speak not the pan-herium.

[01:42:58.580 --> 01:43:01.820]
Senior Bob is not available in stores that the band from the nursing home drives to.

[01:43:01.820 --> 01:43:02.840]
Still call now.

[01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:04.580]
There are many hills.

[01:43:05.620 --> 01:43:06.820]
Let's swear I wonder.

[01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:08.100]
Return.

[01:43:10.540 --> 01:43:10.960]

[01:43:12.580 --> 01:43:12.860]

[01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:13.800]
Come on, do it.

[01:43:13.900 --> 01:43:15.780]
12-to-1 at 5.50 WQA.

[01:43:15.820 --> 01:43:16.180]
I am happy.

[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:17.940]
Happy Wednesday, February 1.

[01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:20.160]
5.607-05-60.

[01:43:20.300 --> 01:43:21.560]
It's all called Wednesday, baby.

[01:43:22.460 --> 01:43:27.420]
I do have a few more things in my file, but you know something these calls are so damn illuminating, aren't they?

[01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:28.540]
They are.

[01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:29.660]
I like them.

[01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:31.800]
5.607-05-60.

[01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:34.720]
Pound 5-60 and the Verizon singular wireless line.

[01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:36.820]
We got a ball game tonight?

[01:43:37.020 --> 01:43:37.480]
No, we don't.

[01:43:37.740 --> 01:43:37.860]
Good.

[01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:40.120]
WQA.

[01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:40.480]
I'm hello.

[01:43:41.420 --> 01:43:42.400]
Take away.

[01:43:43.060 --> 01:43:43.680]
Take away.

[01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:44.320]

[01:43:44.820 --> 01:43:45.020]
Take away.

[01:43:45.020 --> 01:43:45.020]

[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:46.420]
Return.

[01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:48.400]
Return.

[01:43:49.420 --> 01:43:49.420]

[01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:50.680]
Return.

[01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:51.240]

[01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:52.020]
Return.

[01:43:53.020 --> 01:43:53.020]

[01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:53.080]

[01:43:53.380 --> 01:43:53.380]

[01:43:53.380 --> 01:43:53.380]

[01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:54.160]
Return.

[01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:54.200]

[01:43:54.580 --> 01:43:54.780]

[01:43:54.780 --> 01:43:54.840]
Return.

[01:43:54.960 --> 01:43:55.240]
I am like Linda.

[01:43:55.620 --> 01:43:56.080]
That was Linda.

[01:43:56.660 --> 01:43:57.040]
Or Ed Burns.

[01:43:57.880 --> 01:43:58.760]
And we화를 Yes, she was Linda.

[01:43:58.880 --> 01:43:59.940]
Either that or Don Johnson.

[01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:03.240]
5.607-05-60.

[01:44:03.540 --> 01:44:04.680]
We're analyzing last nights.

[01:44:04.860 --> 01:44:05.240]
Address spot.

[01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:05.820]
Your president.

[01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:09.160]
And believe you me, this was a crowd we're hearing from today, that was their president.

[01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:10.180]
Make no mistake about that.

[01:44:10.940 --> 01:44:13.340]
And then of course the phenomenal, wik need democratic response.

[01:44:13.700 --> 01:44:15.880]
Count 560 and the Verizon singular wireless line.

[01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:19.100]
Nobody QAM, hallowed.

[01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:21.620]
Don't forget to make the filter where it dorps in February 5.

[01:44:23.380 --> 01:44:27.500]
Where everything tasted the same. I don't know they stole a silverware of dust.

[01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:31.480]
Remember that it pines in the pines in whatever. That was a long time ago.

[01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:38.900]
Yeah, long ago, dust smorgasbord, where everything was like mushi. It was good for the old farce who had like gummed their food.

[01:44:39.300 --> 01:44:46.680]
They have any teeth to eat at dust. Duff. The spaghetti tasted like the mashed taters and the custard tasted like the gel. It was fabulous.

[01:44:48.540 --> 01:44:53.140]
Oh, somebody Q. I. M. Hello. How was that movie broke my back into glory hole?

[01:44:54.180 --> 01:44:55.080]
W. Q. I. M. Hello.

[01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:03.460]
Now, yeah, I know Grace got to have something to do while he's in his underwear.

[01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:08.260]
You know what you said yesterday was wondering around the building is underwear handed out the arbitrary books?

[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:12.800]
Well, I didn't say his underwear, somebody else. Somebody's W. Q. I. M. Hello.

[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:18.200]
Hey, it's them. I'm going to need that bat line number. Go ahead and get me with it.

[01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:22.620]
W. Q. I. M. Hello. Hello, Neil is Dr. Phil on your pole.

[01:45:23.220 --> 01:45:28.640]
Oh, it's your Phil. They're like boys and he'll go zooming up there. Every time we do one of these negative pulls, he does very well.

[01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:30.560]
He should wind this one hand down.

[01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:35.480]
Okay, thank you. Hands down your pants. Yeah, we've done this pull about 45,000 times, but I already told you to read it.

[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:37.700]
And I did it. And that's okay. I make no apologies for it.

[01:45:37.700 --> 01:45:42.260]
Now this is what I picked her up today. Huh? This is what you can't do to often.

[01:45:42.780 --> 01:45:49.960]
And we never had Ed Solomon on there before. So let's see. James says look at his J who actually likes this show. I can't believe that we have one.

[01:45:50.520 --> 01:45:56.700]
One for the pool. I guess it's borderline. If you oh, yeah, she has no talent. And she's 57 years old.

[01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:05.220]
Van a white. He says, I guess it's borderline. If she'd be considered celebrity, but no, she's a big celebrity. All right. You could meet Pat and Vanna.

[01:46:05.620 --> 01:46:11.600]
They're bigger than Halavai in Jerusalem, man. Once upon a time, I considered Pat and Vanna, but that was, you know, 30 years ago.

[01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:17.740]
No one has ever made as much money with his little talent as Van a white. Before the technology boom, she used to do a little work by physically turning letters.

[01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:22.840]
But now all the bitch does is touch the screen. She just touches it and lights up at what she doesn't really have to touch it either.

[01:46:23.060 --> 01:46:28.160]
But you know, it's just for show. It's like when you get a spin and we go to fortune and like at the slots.

[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:34.420]
It's just to show because the computer already decides going to give you like 25. Oh, G 25 again.

[01:46:34.980 --> 01:46:42.620]
She must have a shiny golden horseshoe show. But because no one has been luckyer than this dumb bitch says, Jay, when I see her, I throw up in my mouth a little bit. Kind of like Dan Rather.

[01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:48.620]
Thank you, Jay. Here's a guy that actually still likes to show. We got one. We got one. Now we're building man. We got one.

[01:46:49.700 --> 01:46:54.160]
We love that. The Orogers about. See, this is probably all month long.

[01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:59.500]
The month of February is for my 30th anniversary in a market on March one. We're going to be getting nothing but hate all month.

[01:46:59.620 --> 01:47:05.340]
We just fine. You know, let it out. I understand. I can handle it. I'm getting paid a lot of money to accept your venom and spewed them.

[01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:12.500]
5 6 7. I feel a lot better though putting on MSNBC, even though they really have a crappy a new staff on there.

[01:47:12.900 --> 01:47:17.620]
Yeah, but they don't have at least they don't have Dana Bash and they don't have Mrs. Limbaugh.

[01:47:17.820 --> 01:47:20.500]
They don't have the one I can't take a rename all the while. That's on the afternoon.

[01:47:20.500 --> 01:47:25.540]
And they don't have the situation run with Wolf Blitzkrieg. Well, he is evil man. It really is easy.

[01:47:25.580 --> 01:47:29.740]
This country can dramatically improve our environment. That's for damn sure about getting your ass out there.

[01:47:31.380 --> 01:47:38.460]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 in the Verizon and singular wireless life. Finally, I think I finally shaken the QM goldrums.

[01:47:38.540 --> 01:47:42.120]
I finally come to my senses just forget about all of it.

[01:47:43.340 --> 01:47:47.800]
Ask now what they're going to do for us because we already know the answer. It's going to be a big O. Nothing.

[01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:51.840]
All we do like the big rock solid. Oh, and I mean the audience does too.

[01:47:52.180 --> 01:47:55.340]
Last time I checked the last night he was doing okay. He was the least hated.

[01:47:55.400 --> 01:47:57.300]
Okay. WQAM. Hello.

[01:47:58.380 --> 01:48:00.920]
Nearly never Sweden House on this game. Goldberg.

[01:48:01.620 --> 01:48:05.300]
I beg your pardon. I said, do you remember the Sweden House on this game?

[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:08.440]
Yeah, I remember the Sweden House, but why not doing that? No more. Okay. Let's say I yesterday is full.

[01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:14.660]
I remember it. Big yellow sign. Sweden House. Schmorg is worried. I remember it. Hey, remember what I remember a lot of other things on this game.

[01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:21.240]
Goldberg that were a lot tastier. WQAM. Hello. WQAM. Hello.

[01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:26.320]
Hey, how you doing? All right. A couple of quick points. It's very frustrating to see.

[01:48:26.660 --> 01:48:32.020]
Late last year, the Democrats had bush up against the ropes with the whole baller plane situation.

[01:48:32.220 --> 01:48:35.280]
They were all coming out in units and saying that bush live. Bush live.

[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:43.740]
I want to talk about the Jack Abramov situation and what about the do-cutting hand situation and what about the Scooter Libby situation and what about the beep, but about all these things.

[01:48:43.940 --> 01:48:48.600]
Yeah, but the point is that they have the whole opinion of Kenny Boylay and all these guys.

[01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:53.020]
Right. They were all in units and saying that bush live. But then when the American people said, what would we do next?

[01:48:53.460 --> 01:48:58.840]
This one said this. This one said that. That's right. Because the Democrats can't get their act together. That's right.

[01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:03.060]
And then when you see last night when Bush is walking in, which I didn't watch the whole thing, I just thought of first part.

[01:49:03.380 --> 01:49:08.280]
You see these Democrats and even the black congressional caucus kissing along the cheek and shivering.

[01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:13.980]
Yeah. And now what the most obnoxious one was, this Mary Landrun and Mary Blanco there from Melusiana.

[01:49:14.500 --> 01:49:19.800]
They were patting them on the back after this speech and kissing his ass. It was disgusting man.

[01:49:19.900 --> 01:49:23.980]
It's pathetic and these guys are so outraged and they see what he goes into the country.

[01:49:23.980 --> 01:49:29.060]
It is like we have we have no chance. I'm only birds are just giving up with Democratic Party. There's nothing else left.

[01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:34.300]
There you go. Amen. We're just enjoying your life, man. It's all I can tell you.

[01:49:34.460 --> 01:49:38.000]
Now I'm killing myself right now. All right. Good luck to you. Let's see on the other side.

[01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:42.600]
Don't touch. Don't touch. Don't touch.

[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:47.000]
I got news for a Democratic Party ain't worth killing yourself for. Believe you me. They're killing me.

[01:49:47.420 --> 01:49:50.360]
They're killing all of us. Weak need, bunch of whims.

[01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:55.700]
It's just like our sports people are on QA. I'm weak need. No fighting them. It's no no combativeness.

[01:49:56.280 --> 01:49:59.660]
And last that man, thank God I didn't see only more than that last 10 minutes.

[01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:03.000]
I thought I'd then it would be over with already. I thought it was safe to like flip by CNN.

[01:50:03.860 --> 01:50:07.840]
And there he was when I went on forever. He went past 10 o'clock. I believe.

[01:50:08.580 --> 01:50:14.300]
Oh brother. It was really and who's this bitch? They got an MSNBC with a frizzy here.

[01:50:14.420 --> 01:50:18.240]
Who shoot from drama from that gap there? They're like the amateur hour.

[01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:24.480]
You know it. Poor Keith O'Leberman. He actually won once every two weeks. He does a pretty interesting show.

[01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:11.600]
You.

[01:52:13.380 --> 01:52:17.600]
Tonight on an all new sleeping with the stars.

[01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:24.540]
Okay, Bobby. You selected the jungle room. Now let's see which celebrity is waiting for you in bed.

[01:52:24.780 --> 01:52:27.720]
Welcome, B. Arthur. I thought you were deaf.

[01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:32.480]
Don't let the smell fool your honey discoled and girl it's gonna rock your world.

[01:52:32.640 --> 01:52:38.520]
Oh boy, see the stars. You haven't seen in a long time. In a way you never won. It's a see- them.

[01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:42.300]
So, Richard Dawson, what you've been up to.

[01:52:42.460 --> 01:52:45.460]
Oh, hello, my dear. Welcome to my laptop.

[01:52:45.460 --> 01:52:47.200]
It will, it will, please. It will, it will.

[01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:52.460]
Sleeping with the stars. They used to be on television. Now, they're on top of you.

[01:52:52.600 --> 01:52:58.680]
Connie Stevens. I had a crush on you when I was 12. Now, you're crushing me.

[01:52:59.220 --> 01:53:04.940]
It's a little bit of nostalgia and a whole lot of nasty. Sleeping with the stars.

[01:53:05.460 --> 01:53:10.700]
From 13 at 5.60 W.Q.A.M. Happy Wednesday to the 1st of February. Man, I got a whole new altitude now.

[01:53:10.700 --> 01:53:13.100]
I don't let me have here off. All right.

[01:53:13.780 --> 01:53:17.740]
It's your job. Stereo is straight. Wait till Josh tells you about that whole deal here.

[01:53:17.960 --> 01:53:19.720]
Okay. You 10 years? No.

[01:53:20.140 --> 01:53:22.140]
Oh well. I'll, you'll blow your brains out.

[01:53:23.220 --> 01:53:28.360]
Very sad and again, I'm beginning to see that that whole, you know, people tell you stuff, but it beat, but it moved, but about it.

[01:53:28.380 --> 01:53:30.700]
And then don't turn up to be what they tell you what it was.

[01:53:32.340 --> 01:53:36.560]
5.6705.60, 0.560, leave a rising and singular. Wireless line.

[01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:40.900]
L. Presidente, your thoughts, positive or negative? Let's do a last-minute or positive or negative pull.

[01:53:41.140 --> 01:53:44.360]
What do you say? How's it going, blah, blah, blah? And by the way, you were right.

[01:53:45.220 --> 01:53:50.020]
God was the ever right. But what? Not about cats, but about this business, you know, about wrestling.

[01:53:50.140 --> 01:53:54.760]
You've been to judgment about this one or that one or whatever. It all smells the same, you know?

[01:53:54.860 --> 01:53:59.760]
Well, when you fall in a septic tank at all, they all smell pretty much the same, just a different, different degree.

[01:54:01.060 --> 01:54:01.980]
W.Q.A.M. Hello.

[01:54:03.020 --> 01:54:05.580]
W.Q.A.M. Hello.

[01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:07.600]
How you doing, Neil?

[01:54:07.940 --> 01:54:08.520]
Yes, sir.

[01:54:08.980 --> 01:54:09.060]
Yeah.

[01:54:10.220 --> 01:54:15.700]
I've been looking for that thing you play with sounds like a nursery rhyme or two-dissongs.

[01:54:16.020 --> 01:54:18.840]
It sounds like they're going to say forbidden words and then they don't.

[01:54:19.320 --> 01:54:19.580]
Yeah.

[01:54:19.980 --> 01:54:22.000]
And I can't find it for the life of me.

[01:54:22.020 --> 01:54:26.020]
What do you mean you've been looking for? We've been looking like in the, in the garage or in the attic?

[01:54:27.100 --> 01:54:29.760]
We're even looking for it. I don't understand what you mean you've been looking for.

[01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:32.380]
Online, I've been trying to find it. Line wire.

[01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:36.100]
There's all sorts of sources I've been trying to go for.

[01:54:36.220 --> 01:54:37.580]
You don't mean this, do you?

[01:54:38.420 --> 01:54:38.840]
You mean that?

[01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:42.240]
There was an old farmer who had an ear out.

[01:54:42.380 --> 01:54:42.800]
Is that it?

[01:54:43.300 --> 01:54:43.740]
That's it.

[01:54:44.260 --> 01:54:45.700]
Oh, okay. Well, guess what?

[01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:46.600]
What?

[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:47.560]
You found it.

[01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:52.580]
There was an old farmer who lived on an ear out.

[01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:59.260]
He's had in the middle just shaping his fists at some boy who worked down by the crypt.

[01:54:59.260 --> 01:55:06.160]
There'd be in the water, there's hands on there marbles and play things and at that pass-more.

[01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:08.160]
There came a young lady.

[01:55:08.500 --> 01:55:11.100]
She looked like a pretty young creature.

[01:55:11.400 --> 01:55:12.920]
She sat on the grass.

[01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:19.680]
She pulled up her dress and she showed them her ruffles and laces and white fluffy dark.

[01:55:20.140 --> 01:55:26.540]
She said she was learning a new way to bring up her children so they would not spin.

[01:55:26.540 --> 01:55:33.300]
While the boys in the barnyard were shoveling repucing litter from yesterday's hunt.

[01:55:33.780 --> 01:55:40.120]
While the girl in the meadow was rubbing her eyes at the fellow down by the dark.

[01:55:40.660 --> 01:55:46.960]
He looked like a man with a sidel ball home in the country with a big fence out front.

[01:55:47.460 --> 01:55:53.760]
If he asked her fun lightly, she'd show him her little pet dog who was subject to this.

[01:55:53.760 --> 01:56:00.540]
And maybe she'd let him grab hold of her small tender hands with the movement so quick.

[01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:04.500]
And then she'd bend over and suck down his candy.

[01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:07.300]
So tastely made of butter, scotch.

[01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:14.000]
And then he'd spread whipped cream all over her cookies that she had left out on her shelf.

[01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:18.860]
If you think this is dirty, you can go put yourself a toothless.

[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:22.180]
Across 16C he's been looking for a disbounded.

[01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:24.360]
This is the place you're looking for it. This is where you'll find it.

[01:56:24.540 --> 01:56:26.280]
And if we can't find it, we'll find it.

[01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:27.780]
And I'll give you an example of that.

[01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:30.900]
You know, they can come up with all the eventum on this bomb.

[01:56:31.120 --> 01:56:33.520]
Probably the great code text is where most of them him and the master.

[01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:35.460]
And that's fine.

[01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:38.860]
But the one thing they can't come up with, and we got over here, okay,

[01:56:38.980 --> 01:56:40.480]
that they'll never do for here in the many years.

[01:56:40.620 --> 01:56:43.320]
You know what it is? An audience? Well, beside that.

[01:56:46.900 --> 01:56:47.900]
Right, right.

[01:56:48.300 --> 01:56:51.460]
Babu, Babu. He's only on her about what, 4,000 times?

[01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:56.680]
Now we're talking Steve Wassarding, MacGallon.

[01:56:57.080 --> 01:56:59.000]
MacGallon. And what's the name of his business?

[01:56:59.400 --> 01:56:59.620]
Bexel.

[01:57:00.940 --> 01:57:01.740]
Bexel corporate.

[01:57:01.880 --> 01:57:03.560]
He's actually the big cheese over there.

[01:57:04.820 --> 01:57:07.000]
I don't know if I have on the ice very red.

[01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:10.180]
I see. In the spirit of time when he's not writing a lot of business,

[01:57:10.180 --> 01:57:12.000]
well, now what do they do? What kind of business is that?

[01:57:12.020 --> 01:57:13.840]
I'm not sure. Crazy people.

[01:57:14.040 --> 01:57:15.940]
People like that. Heavy machinery. Something I haven't done.

[01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:18.900]
Really? Well, I think maybe he's been steering too much heavy machinery.

[01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:20.180]
Babu, Babu, Babu.

[01:57:20.420 --> 01:57:22.140]
See, that's the sound that heavy machinery makes.

[01:57:22.300 --> 01:57:23.360]
Maybe that's why it's like...

[01:57:24.540 --> 01:57:25.360]
Babu, Babu, Babu.

[01:57:25.620 --> 01:57:26.160]
Oh, yeah.

[01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:28.820]
So you guys may have all your misfits, but you never,

[01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:30.480]
that's our misfit, okay?

[01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:31.180]
They can hurt you.

[01:57:31.540 --> 01:57:31.540]

[01:57:31.980 --> 01:57:32.700]
They're just jealous.

[01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:34.740]
That the garage is here.

[01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:36.520]
What the crap? He just...

[01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:36.880]
Yeah, right.

[01:57:36.880 --> 01:57:40.460]
They can have Ron and Gilbert and Reverend Jim.

[01:57:40.660 --> 01:57:41.640]
Not any. Not any.

[01:57:42.120 --> 01:57:43.680]
Yeah, we'll make you a package deal, okay?

[01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.440]
We'll give you Ron and Gilbert and the guy with the ice.

[01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:47.260]
Oh, boy.

[01:57:47.380 --> 01:57:49.000]
Oh, boy. That's the guy with the eye eye eye eye eyes.

[01:57:49.320 --> 01:57:50.880]
And his David Cassidy blow up doll.

[01:57:51.940 --> 01:57:53.020]
How many QYM? Hello?

[01:57:53.740 --> 01:57:55.060]
Hey, Neil. How you doing, buddy?

[01:57:55.380 --> 01:57:55.960]
Okay, Pally.

[01:57:56.620 --> 01:57:58.680]
Good. Neil, I got a question for you.

[01:57:58.760 --> 01:58:00.900]
Am I any... So, I know you're a big, competent open.

[01:58:01.620 --> 01:58:01.860]
Mm-hmm.

[01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:05.700]
Okay, I needed to know if maybe I can have a couple of minutes of your time

[01:58:05.700 --> 01:58:07.600]
and just answer your opinions.

[01:58:07.840 --> 01:58:08.880]
Well, what about what?

[01:58:09.260 --> 01:58:13.140]
Okay, I go to the track almost every single racing night.

[01:58:13.500 --> 01:58:14.600]
No, I've been going there.

[01:58:15.460 --> 01:58:15.940]
What's that?

[01:58:16.520 --> 01:58:18.480]
I said, yeah, full of his money are soon parted.

[01:58:18.740 --> 01:58:19.000]
Go ahead.

[01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:20.240]
I know it's...

[01:58:20.240 --> 01:58:21.480]
If this is going to be about harness racing,

[01:58:21.640 --> 01:58:23.040]
it's going to be a very short call, my friend.

[01:58:23.400 --> 01:58:24.800]
No, it's not. It's actually...

[01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:25.380]
What is it about?

[01:58:25.520 --> 01:58:26.720]
It's about losing your ass at the track?

[01:58:27.380 --> 01:58:30.740]
No, well, almost that, but like I said, Neil,

[01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:32.340]
I've been going there for six years.

[01:58:32.600 --> 01:58:32.780]
Yeah.

[01:58:32.780 --> 01:58:35.140]
And I was actually told...

[01:58:35.140 --> 01:58:37.480]
I was actually thrown off the track the other night.

[01:58:37.520 --> 01:58:38.880]
Good. Well, that's a good idea. I'm glad.

[01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:42.280]
5-6-7. I scored Dick Feinberg in this Steve Wolfenweber

[01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:43.880]
else through this turret off the track.

[01:58:44.460 --> 01:58:45.980]
5-6-7. Oh, 5-6-D.

[01:58:46.140 --> 01:58:49.000]
And you better watch it because Bruce Drainier

[01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:50.880]
is going to be a real danger if you're mess with him.

[01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:53.080]
And Wally Hennessey.

[01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:54.680]
Oh, he knows all the right people.

[01:58:55.580 --> 01:58:58.260]
He gives some of those guys from Nova Scotia down to kick your ass.

[01:58:59.900 --> 01:59:01.200]
Anybody know what I'm talking about?

[01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:01.800]
No, no.

[01:59:01.940 --> 01:59:04.240]
And that's why they're grabbed. That's why they gravitate toward this show.

[01:59:04.380 --> 01:59:06.900]
They can talk all the crap they want, but they're fascinated.

[01:59:07.080 --> 01:59:10.860]
They're obsessed. They're obsessed because they haven't even got any idea what language I'm speaking.

[01:59:12.280 --> 01:59:14.140]
5-6-7. Oh, 5-6-D.

[01:59:14.340 --> 01:59:15.260]
But what about that?

[01:59:15.460 --> 01:59:16.860]
Yeah. How about that Super Bowl?

[01:59:17.020 --> 01:59:18.420]
Words talking Steelers.

[01:59:18.880 --> 01:59:20.060]
Yeah, I don't know. I couldn't care less.

[01:59:20.260 --> 01:59:22.140]
You know, I don't like the Steelers. I don't like the Seahawks.

[01:59:22.440 --> 01:59:24.960]
I guess being an A-patriot guy should probably refer to the AFC.

[01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:25.720]
What do you think, Josh?

[01:59:27.340 --> 01:59:27.980]
Yeah, I know.

[01:59:28.620 --> 01:59:29.840]
Yes. I mean, you hate the Steelers.

[01:59:30.440 --> 01:59:31.940]
I don't really hate the Steelers.

[01:59:32.040 --> 01:59:34.100]
I mean, I hate them when they're playing the Patriots, of course.

[01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:37.880]
But then, I don't know. I mean, Seattle to me, like leaves me limp, you know?

[01:59:39.480 --> 01:59:41.380]
I like the City. I might be rooting for them.

[01:59:41.500 --> 01:59:43.240]
No, no, I'm not talking about the City. I've never been there.

[01:59:43.300 --> 01:59:45.480]
But I'm just talking about the team, like, I don't know.

[01:59:46.220 --> 01:59:48.040]
They're neither fish nor foul to me.

[01:59:48.500 --> 01:59:49.540]
The AFC in favor of the OAS.

[01:59:50.380 --> 01:59:55.680]
I mean, so many marginal, you know, the Redskins, the Fony Ballonion, the Giants.

[01:59:55.800 --> 01:59:58.660]
Oh, my God. And that Peyton Manning's a sister, the quarterback.

[01:59:59.580 --> 02:00:00.580]
Oh, brother.

[02:00:01.800 --> 02:00:02.580]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:00:02.800 --> 02:00:05.120]
AFC doesn't deserve to. The AFCs wear B.I.

[02:00:05.280 --> 02:00:05.660]
Wouldn't you agree?

[02:00:06.200 --> 02:00:08.460]
We got the Dolphins. They're going to go 16.

[02:00:08.620 --> 02:00:11.040]
Oh, you'll say, kind of on defeated this evening, Dolphins.

[02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:12.780]
And they're going to put it on the other place.

[02:00:13.220 --> 02:00:14.580]
What are we going to do then?

[02:00:15.860 --> 02:00:19.900]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60, and they've arrived in singular wireless line.

[02:00:20.020 --> 02:00:25.960]
Your take on the Super Bowl, on George W. Bush, on the incredibly weak Democratic response

[02:00:25.960 --> 02:00:28.340]
from at the Fruit Face Governor of Virginia.

[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:29.840]
Boy, he was lame.

[02:00:30.700 --> 02:00:31.780]
Dominic Q.A. Ann, hello.

[02:00:32.820 --> 02:00:33.320]
Hey, Mel.

[02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:34.040]
Yes, sir.

[02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:37.440]
I don't know if she fits the celebrity part, but I know she's no talent.

[02:00:37.620 --> 02:00:38.480]
How about Rita Cosby?

[02:00:39.100 --> 02:00:42.160]
She's a celebrity, man. She's big, and I'm SNBC, and she can't speak.

[02:00:42.380 --> 02:00:43.040]
A good one. Thank you.

[02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:44.060]
Rita Cosby.

[02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:45.360]
She can't speak.

[02:00:47.060 --> 02:00:48.860]
Maybe we can put her on instead of Lennie Martez.

[02:00:48.980 --> 02:00:49.340]
What do you think?

[02:00:50.420 --> 02:00:51.420]
Or maybe we'll let him martez.

[02:00:51.560 --> 02:00:52.580]
I'll take Lennie. He looks better.

[02:00:52.580 --> 02:00:53.720]
Yeah, that's true.

[02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:57.840]
Oh, God. She may not be able to speak, but she sure is how to look to it.

[02:00:57.840 --> 02:00:58.660]
That she's proud.

[02:00:58.800 --> 02:00:59.260]
What a cow.

[02:00:59.460 --> 02:01:00.040]
She's a cow.

[02:01:00.380 --> 02:01:01.580]
She's a nasty snag.

[02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:02.020]
I know.

[02:01:02.480 --> 02:01:05.820]
My God. Even Carl Molden would Israel and over in his grave, he can't believe it.

[02:01:05.940 --> 02:01:07.420]
Is he still alive? Did we figure out our world?

[02:01:07.620 --> 02:01:08.000]
He's dead.

[02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:08.760]
I don't know.

[02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:09.900]
I'm going to go up again.

[02:01:10.340 --> 02:01:11.240]
His nose lives on.

[02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:17.420]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60, and they've arrived in singular wireless line.

[02:01:17.420 --> 02:01:18.780]
New little Google on Carl Molden.

[02:01:18.920 --> 02:01:21.160]
He was an all fall down with Brandon Newwilder.

[02:01:21.160 --> 02:01:21.720]
He's still Google.

[02:01:21.900 --> 02:01:22.820]
Or in baby was in there.

[02:01:22.940 --> 02:01:23.660]
Yeah, he's still alive.

[02:01:24.180 --> 02:01:25.200]
Carl Molden, I told you.

[02:01:25.800 --> 02:01:28.420]
In fact, he's probably doing some of them American distress spots.

[02:01:30.340 --> 02:01:33.840]
He was in the streets of San Francisco in Michael Lugris when some of us actually liked

[02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:36.500]
Michael Lugris before he decided he was a sex pot.

[02:01:37.700 --> 02:01:38.600]
A sex symbol.

[02:01:39.160 --> 02:01:40.160]
Maybe somebody told him he was.

[02:01:40.600 --> 02:01:42.280]
Well, he, he haven't only believed it.

[02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:43.900]
Even that Catherine Zita Jones.

[02:01:44.540 --> 02:01:44.540]

[02:01:45.140 --> 02:01:45.500]
Exactly.

[02:01:46.900 --> 02:01:47.260]
WDQYM.

[02:01:47.340 --> 02:01:47.500]
Hello.

[02:01:48.180 --> 02:01:48.960]
Oh, you know how you're doing.

[02:01:49.240 --> 02:01:49.820]
All right, Pallie.

[02:01:49.820 --> 02:01:52.400]
You know, I used to wonder after visiting Germany.

[02:01:52.420 --> 02:01:53.980]
I used to wonder, how did this happen?

[02:01:54.100 --> 02:01:55.160]
How did World War II happen?

[02:01:55.460 --> 02:01:56.760]
How does the Nazis take power?

[02:01:56.980 --> 02:01:57.480]
Really easy.

[02:01:57.540 --> 02:01:58.820]
Take a look at what's going on right now.

[02:01:58.940 --> 02:02:00.600]
They say never again, again.

[02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:01.600]
Exactly.

[02:02:01.900 --> 02:02:02.620]
And I said something.

[02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:06.660]
If he had said last night that we're launching a massive nuclear strike against the whole

[02:02:06.660 --> 02:02:09.600]
rest of the world, people would have sat there and said, yeah, right on.

[02:02:09.700 --> 02:02:11.920]
They were going to say, what's the American idol on?

[02:02:11.920 --> 02:02:12.740]
That's what they would have said.

[02:02:12.860 --> 02:02:13.080]
Exactly.

[02:02:13.300 --> 02:02:13.840]
It's amazing.

[02:02:14.020 --> 02:02:15.060]
It's happening all over again.

[02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:15.820]
We don't know.

[02:02:15.820 --> 02:02:18.300]
I think describes the behavior of American people right now.

[02:02:18.460 --> 02:02:18.680]
Idol.

[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:19.440]
IDLE.

[02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:20.760]
Hi, Riospo, Idol.

[02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:24.060]
I think all the fast food has just rolled up into the soup.

[02:02:24.100 --> 02:02:25.040]
That must be it.

[02:02:25.260 --> 02:02:26.820]
I think it was those crispy creams, man.

[02:02:27.340 --> 02:02:27.900]
I think so.

[02:02:28.620 --> 02:02:29.860]
Turned out green's the mush.

[02:02:30.340 --> 02:02:30.680]
Unbelievable.

[02:02:31.060 --> 02:02:32.220]
I can't believe I see it happening.

[02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:33.400]
And we're also stupid.

[02:02:33.700 --> 02:02:35.560]
And everybody just follows along like sheep.

[02:02:35.820 --> 02:02:37.220]
Just like they did in Nazi Germany.

[02:02:37.580 --> 02:02:41.460]
And I know the fact that the Nazis told them, or were defending the fatherland.

[02:02:41.780 --> 02:02:44.840]
All those people in the concentration camps, they're insurgents.

[02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:46.420]
It would just went on and on.

[02:02:46.780 --> 02:02:47.300]
And there you go.

[02:02:47.300 --> 02:02:48.360]
It's happening all over again.

[02:02:48.400 --> 02:02:48.980]
It came to you, baby.

[02:02:49.100 --> 02:02:49.540]
Take a wrap.

[02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:51.240]
It was a lot of dead people rallying around.

[02:02:51.240 --> 02:02:51.880]
And nobody cares.

[02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:52.760]
Good luck to us, Pellie.

[02:02:53.160 --> 02:02:54.080]
Go help God help us.

[02:02:54.340 --> 02:02:54.920]
We love the viewers.

[02:02:55.320 --> 02:02:55.560]
Okay.

[02:02:56.380 --> 02:02:56.900]
Ghost dealers.

[02:02:57.120 --> 02:02:57.440]
There you go.

[02:02:57.580 --> 02:02:58.940]
We love the stealers.

[02:02:58.940 --> 02:03:00.020]
They're really great.

[02:03:00.300 --> 02:03:01.340]
And that Bill Cower.

[02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:03.360]
Got a look on his post.

[02:03:03.540 --> 02:03:04.860]
He's a scary guy.

[02:03:06.160 --> 02:03:08.900]
He's got that look of a crazy person out of face.

[02:03:09.080 --> 02:03:09.240]
Yeah.

[02:03:10.680 --> 02:03:11.840]
That jawed just out.

[02:03:11.920 --> 02:03:13.900]
And you think, oh, are you going to kill somebody right now?

[02:03:13.900 --> 02:03:14.640]
Bill Cower.

[02:03:15.700 --> 02:03:18.660]
As opposed to my home room, it was just a big fat guy, but I must say.

[02:03:19.620 --> 02:03:20.620]
Don't you find him to be?

[02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:21.060]
I don't know.

[02:03:21.260 --> 02:03:22.660]
He don't look like a football coach to me.

[02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:25.780]
He had great success in Green Bay and now in Seattle.

[02:03:26.060 --> 02:03:26.400]
Like home room.

[02:03:26.460 --> 02:03:27.380]
You like him, Josh or not?

[02:03:27.660 --> 02:03:28.260]
Yeah, I think it's fine.

[02:03:28.500 --> 02:03:28.860]
He's okay.

[02:03:29.980 --> 02:03:34.160]
I mean, he didn't know Dan LeBasterd or Dave Wandsdam.

[02:03:34.540 --> 02:03:35.560]
That's who can be.

[02:03:36.060 --> 02:03:36.420]
Exactly.

[02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:40.720]
The Wandsdam era man is big ballies.

[02:03:40.940 --> 02:03:42.020]
And he'll jump it on the bad way.

[02:03:42.020 --> 02:03:42.980]
And we're going to kiss a man now.

[02:03:43.040 --> 02:03:46.040]
They got the next statement era and they won six in a row, including that fixed game

[02:03:46.040 --> 02:03:46.860]
against the Patriots.

[02:03:46.860 --> 02:03:47.900]
And it's going to really be great.

[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:48.800]
And we're going to like, yeah.

[02:03:49.540 --> 02:03:50.860]
Just keep talking to yourself.

[02:03:51.160 --> 02:03:53.920]
You know, living in the past, just like those make-believe fans up here.

[02:03:54.460 --> 02:03:55.180]
What are these suck?

[02:03:55.340 --> 02:03:56.180]
They are pathetic.

[02:03:58.060 --> 02:03:58.980]
Let's talk some hockey.

[02:03:59.160 --> 02:03:59.540]
What do you say?

[02:03:59.740 --> 02:04:00.280]
Come on, Jodie.

[02:04:01.840 --> 02:04:02.940]
WQA, I'm hockey central.

[02:04:02.940 --> 02:04:03.220]
Hello.

[02:04:03.420 --> 02:04:04.200]
Hey, what's up, Neil.

[02:04:04.560 --> 02:04:04.960]
How you doing, sir?

[02:04:05.240 --> 02:04:07.480]
I have a problem with this and I don't understand.

[02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:10.900]
It's worth all the people who went through like the Vietnam War.

[02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:14.020]
How come like no one's, you know, they went through it.

[02:04:14.180 --> 02:04:16.800]
It's kind of like, they're saying, man, convenient all the timers.

[02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:17.340]
They all forgot.

[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:18.100]
I don't know.

[02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:18.700]
I don't know.

[02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:20.420]
We're going through the same damn thing all over again.

[02:04:20.420 --> 02:04:21.760]
It looks like the nobody's protesting.

[02:04:22.200 --> 02:04:23.240]
You can see it on the news.

[02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:24.640]
Yeah, we got about 10 people in protest.

[02:04:24.820 --> 02:04:25.960]
I hope they can all want to show it to you.

[02:04:26.580 --> 02:04:27.360]
Yeah, I know.

[02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:29.500]
Like I saw born in the fourth of July.

[02:04:30.220 --> 02:04:31.360]
It was just amazing.

[02:04:31.540 --> 02:04:33.220]
It's like the same exact thing.

[02:04:33.600 --> 02:04:36.240]
Yeah, but since the Scientologist, we got a whole of Tom Cruise.

[02:04:36.540 --> 02:04:37.640]
The things just happened to see him again.

[02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:38.400]
All right.

[02:04:38.460 --> 02:04:40.160]
I'm still waiting for them, bumper stickers, Neil.

[02:04:40.160 --> 02:04:40.420]
I'm here.

[02:04:40.700 --> 02:04:41.420]
Good luck, palmy.

[02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:42.900]
Yeah, he's waiting.

[02:04:43.020 --> 02:04:43.540]
Hold your breath.

[02:04:43.680 --> 02:04:46.980]
We post stories every now and again about the guy from born on the fourth of July,

[02:04:46.980 --> 02:04:47.900]
Ron Coveick and everything.

[02:04:47.980 --> 02:04:48.080]
Right.

[02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:49.500]
You won't see it on the mainstream media.

[02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:50.080]
Of course not.

[02:04:50.260 --> 02:04:51.280]
Because that's bad for business.

[02:04:51.400 --> 02:04:53.400]
He's one of the Amcami Pinko protestors, man.

[02:04:53.720 --> 02:04:55.200]
He's bad for troop morale.

[02:04:55.200 --> 02:04:55.980]
Don't you understand?

[02:04:56.600 --> 02:04:57.600]
Bad for troop morale.

[02:04:58.280 --> 02:05:01.060]
Just like our sports people are bad for my morale after yesterday.

[02:05:01.440 --> 02:05:02.180]
I'll tell you.

[02:05:02.700 --> 02:05:04.900]
What they pulled on me, what they did to me yesterday,

[02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:07.520]
even Hitler would have considered to be above and beyond the call.

[02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:08.020]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:05:08.120 --> 02:05:09.160]
Don't take it personally now.

[02:05:09.580 --> 02:05:10.720]
No, he, uh, he, uh, right.

[02:05:12.140 --> 02:05:13.340]
I did take it personally.

[02:05:13.660 --> 02:05:15.620]
I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm stuck to my back.

[02:05:15.760 --> 02:05:16.900]
You're like, I'm going to stab you the heart.

[02:05:17.140 --> 02:05:17.740]
No, you're missing.

[02:05:17.840 --> 02:05:19.180]
Leave me out there hanging on the limb.

[02:05:19.240 --> 02:05:21.760]
Like, oh, well, we don't care about that stupid thing.

[02:05:21.880 --> 02:05:24.040]
We're not going to, you know, you're overthinking it.

[02:05:24.040 --> 02:05:28.220]
If you would just take a look at the intellectual responses on a Dan Gregg Kotex blog on it,

[02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:30.380]
then you don't understand this strictly for morons, you know.

[02:05:31.820 --> 02:05:34.640]
And like I said, my name isn't even on the pool.

[02:05:34.920 --> 02:05:36.620]
I have nothing to do with their pool.

[02:05:37.040 --> 02:05:38.020]
And yet they're obsessed.

[02:05:38.440 --> 02:05:40.240]
You thought Joey Reynolds was obsessed.

[02:05:40.560 --> 02:05:42.020]
You thought Dickie Farkel was obsessed.

[02:05:42.860 --> 02:05:43.740]
They're all obsessed.

[02:05:44.420 --> 02:05:45.420]
And you know what they're obsessed with?

[02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:46.760]
That's right.

[02:05:46.920 --> 02:05:48.740]
And the more they claim that they hate the longer they listen.

[02:05:49.280 --> 02:05:52.280]
Their length of listenership is like 80 hours a week and I'm only on for like 20.

[02:05:53.300 --> 02:05:54.000]
Well, they got the tapes.

[02:05:54.220 --> 02:05:55.700]
They're taping over and over.

[02:05:55.760 --> 02:05:56.420]
They're going online.

[02:05:56.720 --> 02:05:56.980]
They're listening.

[02:05:57.460 --> 02:05:59.320]
They're all, they're, they can't get enough of it.

[02:05:59.780 --> 02:06:01.020]
It is so bad.

[02:06:01.180 --> 02:06:02.820]
It's always going to make it all that money.

[02:06:03.040 --> 02:06:03.220]
Yeah.

[02:06:03.460 --> 02:06:03.820]
Yamama.

[02:06:05.460 --> 02:06:07.140]
26 past noon at QAM.

[02:06:07.140 --> 02:06:09.040]
We got some good stuff coming up later on today.

[02:06:09.160 --> 02:06:11.020]
I think I don't know what it is, but boy, it's going to be good.

[02:06:12.080 --> 02:06:14.040]
If you're in a dead end job, if you're underpaid,

They'll miss that train of opportunity this year, half a board, like Chris Moore would say.

[02:07:04.340 --> 02:07:05.280]
Hot Dog, half a board.

[02:07:05.380 --> 02:07:06.020]
Remember when he said that?

[02:07:06.140 --> 02:07:06.500]
That was so.

[02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:09.400]
Half a board this year by calling 866 Fast Train.

[02:07:09.520 --> 02:07:13.260]

Call 1-866 Fast Train.

[02:07:16.480 --> 02:07:17.900]
Hot Dog, half a board.

[02:07:18.280 --> 02:07:20.360]
This is Neil Rogers.

[02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:25.000]
This is 516-2-A-1 Solid.

[02:07:26.140 --> 02:07:27.660]
A lot of pop little boys.

[02:07:28.600 --> 02:07:31.780]
From the producers of ABC's Scythe by Taylor Invasion,

[02:07:31.780 --> 02:07:35.320]
comes a show about even scarier, more diabolical, Jared.

[02:07:35.780 --> 02:07:38.100]
The government has denied their existence for years.

[02:07:38.580 --> 02:07:41.540]
But they're here, among us, in your town,

[02:07:41.920 --> 02:07:46.320]
even in your own home, just waiting for you, jumping up the phone.

[02:07:47.320 --> 02:07:51.500]
George Woodstar says the listener in invasion of privacy.

[02:07:52.580 --> 02:07:54.100]
Hello, this is Gustav Arsabart.

[02:07:54.280 --> 02:07:58.100]
What is being your question and your problem with your product and their service, please?

[02:07:58.360 --> 02:07:59.880]
Yes, he might be just crashing.

[02:07:59.880 --> 02:08:00.960]
I don't have it.

[02:08:01.940 --> 02:08:02.700]
Did you hear that?

[02:08:03.600 --> 02:08:05.000]
Yes, I am doing a gig at this wedding.

[02:08:05.500 --> 02:08:06.620]
Is someone else there on the line?

[02:08:07.640 --> 02:08:09.280]
No. Who is this?

[02:08:09.620 --> 02:08:10.380]
Yes, I do.

[02:08:11.100 --> 02:08:13.220]
Don't worry, Steve. It's just me, your president.

[02:08:13.920 --> 02:08:14.600]
Don't mind me.

[02:08:14.760 --> 02:08:16.180]
Mr. President, what's going on?

[02:08:16.480 --> 02:08:17.480]
And how did you know my name?

[02:08:17.780 --> 02:08:18.880]
Oh, I know a lot about you.

[02:08:19.200 --> 02:08:20.640]
I like your nickname, his Bubba,

[02:08:21.100 --> 02:08:22.680]
and your order, Pete, say, have a Friday night.

[02:08:22.920 --> 02:08:23.020]
What?

[02:08:23.200 --> 02:08:23.880]
Let's see, here.

[02:08:24.160 --> 02:08:26.580]
Looks like you missed a few payments on that student loan, there, Bubba.

[02:08:26.740 --> 02:08:27.420]
I can't believe this.

[02:08:27.580 --> 02:08:28.400]
You can't do this.

[02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:29.840]
Thank you, Ann, there, Bubba.

[02:08:30.300 --> 02:08:32.140]
Oh, you must have been on right-hand indignation.

[02:08:32.320 --> 02:08:33.380]
Watch it there, Hodgie.

[02:08:33.480 --> 02:08:34.560]
But tell us, New Denny.

[02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:36.260]
But this is where the being in private's got it.

[02:08:36.320 --> 02:08:38.560]
A private overseas call, there, bootaboy.

[02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:40.420]
I am not that bonus there, I am Hingo.

[02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:41.700]
I don't care if you're Shamu.

[02:08:41.940 --> 02:08:43.060]
Don't mess with Texas, son.

[02:08:43.340 --> 02:08:44.420]
Because I got a predator drone.

[02:08:44.780 --> 02:08:47.700]
Circling 38-51, Calcutta Court right now.

[02:08:47.900 --> 02:08:48.500]
So watch it, buddy.

[02:08:49.300 --> 02:08:51.800]
Invasion of privacy tonight at Rick's R&D

[02:08:51.800 --> 02:08:53.460]
over civil rights station on ABC.

[02:08:54.520 --> 02:08:58.260]
From 31 to 5-60, all the freedoms all the time, inter-grid-almet tubes.

[02:08:58.260 --> 02:09:00.000]
Samoledo, yesterday gets confirmed.

[02:09:00.180 --> 02:09:00.900]
That's it. Bye-bye.

[02:09:01.100 --> 02:09:01.940]
Kiss your grass goodbye.

[02:09:02.380 --> 02:09:02.680]
I heard it.

[02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:04.340]
Kiss your grass goodbye.

[02:09:04.720 --> 02:09:05.160]
I told the cast.

[02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:10.840]
Speaking of gay, governor Chris Greg Warr, whatever her name is,

[02:09:11.300 --> 02:09:14.100]
signed a gay civil rights bill in law in the state of Washington yesterday.

[02:09:14.460 --> 02:09:17.720]
Those law may be held in limbo, if opponents are successful in forcing a referendum.

[02:09:18.020 --> 02:09:20.820]
They're going to hold it, they're going to be doing limbo rock in the tea room

[02:09:20.820 --> 02:09:22.020]
while they're looking for them glory holes.

[02:09:22.820 --> 02:09:26.280]
The major adds sexual orientations to the state law that bans discrimination in housing,

[02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:27.580]
employment, insurance, and credit.

[02:09:27.940 --> 02:09:29.140]
See that's part of the gay agenda.

[02:09:30.460 --> 02:09:33.600]
The amendment passed by and they're going to give everybody their own power drill.

[02:09:34.840 --> 02:09:38.400]
They're going to be glory holes in every public building on sidewalks, you name it.

[02:09:39.160 --> 02:09:41.440]
The amendment patent and the worm is going to turn, man.

[02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:41.860]
You'll see.

[02:09:42.920 --> 02:09:45.520]
Passed by the legislature on Friday makes Washington the 17th state

[02:09:45.520 --> 02:09:49.640]
to pass the law covering gays and lesbians and the 7th to protect transgendered people.

[02:09:50.720 --> 02:09:54.120]
The law's schedule will take effect in June 90 days after the end of the legislative session.

[02:09:54.120 --> 02:09:57.820]
However, it would be frozen until November vote if opponent Tim Iman,

[02:09:58.200 --> 02:10:01.740]
that's Iman the Pymon gets enough signatures by the June 7 deadline for referendum.

[02:10:02.480 --> 02:10:05.320]
In addition to seeking a removing sexual orientation of the law,

[02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:09.100]
Iman is pushing an initiative that would prohibit state government from requiring quotas

[02:10:09.100 --> 02:10:14.400]
or other preferential treatment for any person who grew based on sexual orientation or sexual preference.

[02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:16.080]
You don't like them faggots.

[02:10:16.860 --> 02:10:17.420]
They like that.

[02:10:18.220 --> 02:10:18.980]
They don't like you.

[02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:20.360]
They're the faggots.

[02:10:20.640 --> 02:10:22.300]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:10:22.760 --> 02:10:24.120]
Look at that fool, man.

[02:10:24.280 --> 02:10:25.020]
Dead is a door now.

[02:10:25.080 --> 02:10:25.900]
Look at that.

[02:10:26.040 --> 02:10:27.380]
Looky, looky, here comes cookie.

[02:10:27.540 --> 02:10:28.140]
What's that all about?

[02:10:28.140 --> 02:10:29.500]
Haven't been taking any calls all day.

[02:10:29.860 --> 02:10:30.640]
What are you talking about?

[02:10:30.760 --> 02:10:32.600]
I'm taking calls up the old yin-yin, man.

[02:10:32.980 --> 02:10:34.120]
You're taking more calls today.

[02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:35.100]
We haven't about a month.

[02:10:35.800 --> 02:10:37.100]
Maybe we exhausted our supply.

[02:10:37.200 --> 02:10:38.760]
Maybe those 10 people are like worn out now.

[02:10:39.040 --> 02:10:41.360]
Oh, those people are going to get it right out.

[02:10:43.340 --> 02:10:44.860]
Last call for calls, man.

[02:10:45.100 --> 02:10:47.200]
I think I might just crank up a little bit.

[02:10:48.540 --> 02:10:49.060]
A rat.

[02:10:49.180 --> 02:10:49.720]
No time again.

[02:10:50.140 --> 02:10:50.780]
Oh, rat.

[02:10:52.020 --> 02:10:53.920]
Oh, standing in the shadows of Motown.

[02:10:54.120 --> 02:10:55.740]
One of the really great clicks in truth in audio

[02:10:55.740 --> 02:10:56.980]
is going to go out and buy it right now.

[02:10:57.420 --> 02:10:57.580]
Not.

[02:10:58.360 --> 02:10:58.880]
What do you say?

[02:11:00.520 --> 02:11:00.880]
Not.

[02:11:02.140 --> 02:11:02.620]
All right.

[02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:05.600]
Go go go go.

[02:11:06.740 --> 02:11:08.820]
I've been to one and how I'm doing.

[02:11:09.340 --> 02:11:10.320]
Nice do I up, Mo.

[02:11:10.580 --> 02:11:10.900]
You see that?

[02:11:11.300 --> 02:11:11.600]
You doing great?

[02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:11.940]
You're right up.

[02:11:12.360 --> 02:11:12.680]
Excellent.

[02:11:13.900 --> 02:11:15.280]
OK, we got a couple of smattering.

[02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:16.500]
You're probably going to be too exciting.

[02:11:16.620 --> 02:11:16.920]
We'll see.

[02:11:17.540 --> 02:11:18.240]
How many QYM?

[02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:18.460]
Hello.

[02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:21.400]
Yeah, could I speak to Neil Poison?

[02:11:22.180 --> 02:11:24.040]
Is this a phony voice or is this a real piece?

[02:11:24.420 --> 02:11:24.660]
A voice.

[02:11:24.860 --> 02:11:25.300]
A phony voice.

[02:11:25.860 --> 02:11:26.220]
Who?

[02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:27.600]
You know, what do you got?

[02:11:28.840 --> 02:11:31.600]
I just want to give him two books.

[02:11:32.080 --> 02:11:34.380]
It's just a direct line, two and more of a little number.

[02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:36.400]
Yeah, this is the direct line.

[02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:37.160]
This is the bat line.

[02:11:37.920 --> 02:11:38.920]
Come on, the bat line.

[02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:40.440]
Oh, it's going to be a good one.

[02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:41.560]
Now his voice is changing.

[02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:42.840]
You're going to call it, it's going to keep going.

[02:11:43.120 --> 02:11:44.120]
How many other voices do you do?

[02:11:44.280 --> 02:11:44.780]
Like Rich Little?

[02:11:45.240 --> 02:11:46.000]
They all sound like you.

[02:11:46.840 --> 02:11:48.300]
They all sound like me.

[02:11:48.500 --> 02:11:50.060]
They all sound like you, yeah.

[02:11:50.500 --> 02:11:52.960]
Oh, well, that can't be possible, man.

[02:11:53.080 --> 02:11:53.760]
Oh, that's possible.

[02:11:54.200 --> 02:11:55.620]
Is this the lifeguard?

[02:11:55.980 --> 02:11:57.040]
Is this the gay lifeguard?

[02:11:57.720 --> 02:11:58.480]
No, I'm sorry.

[02:11:58.480 --> 02:11:59.440]
It's not the gay lifeguard.

[02:11:59.540 --> 02:12:00.520]
It's the gay lifeguard.

[02:12:00.700 --> 02:12:01.660]
Yeah, it was just Prince of William.

[02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:02.460]
Is this William?

[02:12:02.780 --> 02:12:04.740]
Well, let's hear you mindswired, mate.

[02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:05.400]
That's still me.

[02:12:05.740 --> 02:12:06.640]
OK, mate, yeah.

[02:12:06.920 --> 02:12:08.260]
We got your mate over here.

[02:12:08.420 --> 02:12:09.640]
And by the way, he and Finland are good.

[02:12:09.880 --> 02:12:10.160]
You might.

[02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:10.940]
He's pretty sore.

[02:12:11.880 --> 02:12:14.860]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 8.

[02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:16.260]
That was outstanding.

[02:12:16.460 --> 02:12:17.700]
See, I, what did I tell you?

[02:12:17.720 --> 02:12:20.860]
Oh, you have to have that pur...

[02:12:22.040 --> 02:12:23.280]
What is that word I'm looking for?

[02:12:23.360 --> 02:12:24.160]
Herstic acidity.

[02:12:24.300 --> 02:12:25.200]
No, that's not it.

[02:12:25.580 --> 02:12:25.940]
Persperation.

[02:12:26.260 --> 02:12:27.080]
The perspiration.

[02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:28.540]
You have to perspire and expire.

[02:12:29.480 --> 02:12:30.780]
No, you have to persevere, mate.

[02:12:30.940 --> 02:12:32.140]
You have to have that perseverance.

[02:12:32.680 --> 02:12:32.880]
Ah.

[02:12:33.160 --> 02:12:35.060]
And keep plowing through and plowing through.

[02:12:35.140 --> 02:12:37.120]
Then after the first 40, 50,000,

[02:12:37.120 --> 02:12:38.600]
then you finally get something like that and you say,

[02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:39.700]
God, that was well worth it.

[02:12:40.080 --> 02:12:41.180]
45 times the price.

[02:12:42.060 --> 02:12:44.360]
I guarantee you won't hear that on the adducent toast show.

[02:12:44.360 --> 02:12:45.320]
And no way Jose.

[02:12:46.860 --> 02:12:50.840]
Let's talk to Pat Rai again and see what Pat has to say about his hairdo, huh?

[02:12:51.740 --> 02:12:52.700]
Hey, slick, how you doing?

[02:12:53.840 --> 02:12:54.720]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:12:54.920 --> 02:12:55.720]
And how's...

[02:12:55.720 --> 02:12:55.860]
Yeah!

[02:12:55.860 --> 02:12:56.920]
Doing that's the most important thing.

[02:12:57.060 --> 02:12:57.560]
Q-I-M.

[02:12:58.280 --> 02:12:58.820]
Oh, good evening.

[02:12:59.460 --> 02:12:59.640]
Yep.

[02:13:00.280 --> 02:13:01.040]
Take care, uh.

[02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:01.940]
Take care, uh.

[02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:03.360]
That's not us.

[02:13:04.220 --> 02:13:05.340]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:13:06.080 --> 02:13:07.240]
Hello, and they'll get after that.

[02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:08.100]
And back to you.

[02:13:08.720 --> 02:13:09.440]
Yeah, thank you.

[02:13:09.640 --> 02:13:11.180]
Uh, I have listened to you.

[02:13:11.340 --> 02:13:11.980]
Oh, my God.

[02:13:12.420 --> 02:13:13.180]
Probably you have.

[02:13:13.900 --> 02:13:14.740]
130 years ago.

[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:16.000]
I guess about that.

[02:13:16.220 --> 02:13:17.100]
I don't know how to manage.

[02:13:17.900 --> 02:13:18.940]
Probably close to 30.

[02:13:19.060 --> 02:13:20.280]
When you used to have a show at night.

[02:13:20.820 --> 02:13:23.080]
When you used to do the dating show, do you remember that?

[02:13:23.240 --> 02:13:23.860]
The S.I.C.I.

[02:13:23.980 --> 02:13:26.360]
The mating and dating show on WNWS7-I-E.

[02:13:26.420 --> 02:13:27.860]
That's when 790s were listened to.

[02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:28.940]
Oh, my God.

[02:13:29.080 --> 02:13:30.320]
I never called you out like this.

[02:13:30.460 --> 02:13:31.360]
Everything you've ever done.

[02:13:31.480 --> 02:13:33.180]
I've listened to every 50s of every night.

[02:13:33.620 --> 02:13:34.980]
And I had just wanted to call you in and said,

[02:13:34.980 --> 02:13:37.280]
thank you for many years of your time.

[02:13:37.720 --> 02:13:38.980]
Well, I was an astridium, man.

[02:13:39.060 --> 02:13:39.460]

Right.

[02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:46.020]
Green sleeves.

Five, six, seven, oh five green jeans.

[02:22:53.840 --> 02:23:00.560]
Yeah, what what well that's because we're concentrating on our own stuff that that's a stupid Harold stuff with all I inside

[02:23:00.560 --> 02:23:05.700]
You know on a baloney all that phony garbage on here which by the way fat boys have put a lot of the messages on here

[02:23:05.700 --> 02:23:07.360]
You're not fooling anybody fat boy

[02:23:08.200 --> 02:23:11.360]
When I find out who gave him that email address of mine, Duff

[02:23:11.360 --> 02:23:13.100]
I'm gonna like blow somebody's brains out

[02:23:13.680 --> 02:23:15.080]
You're on the sand you fairy

[02:23:15.960 --> 02:23:20.120]
See sometimes people they they act without thinking you know, right?

[02:23:20.300 --> 02:23:24.920]
No, yeah, all the time. You don't understand like when you think about it for like about 10 seconds to think is this somebody that

[02:23:24.920 --> 02:23:29.980]
Needle would really want to communicate within any way shape or foam and the answer of course is absolutely or not

[02:23:30.720 --> 02:23:32.680]
But nevertheless a

[02:23:33.420 --> 02:23:38.520]
Website called TMZ dot com which is a one of those 80 million entertainment website kind of things

[02:23:38.520 --> 02:23:44.700]
Okay, they've obtained documents and Michael Jackson's custody case in which the singers lawyer accused the judge of being

[02:23:44.700 --> 02:23:47.800]
Prejudiced against his famous client in the legal papers

[02:23:47.800 --> 02:23:51.940]
Jackson's attorneys claims that judge Stephen Lacks L.A.C.S

[02:23:51.940 --> 02:23:56.600]
Made comments that Jackson obtained passports were his children by the use of subterfuge

[02:23:57.900 --> 02:24:03.980]
In the papers Jackson's attorney claims the judge made other comments indicating bias including that Jackson's been reported to have made

[02:24:03.980 --> 02:24:08.640]
Antisemitic statements that the Kingdom of a Bahrain is the most or one of the most

[02:24:08.640 --> 02:24:14.420]
Antisemitic countries in the world and that the Kingdom of Bahrain would make a difficult for Jackson's children to be bar mitzvah

[02:24:14.900 --> 02:24:22.580]
Oh, you may well now. Why would they be bar mitzvah? I don't I don't understand that is the supposed mother Jewish

[02:24:23.020 --> 02:24:25.100]
No, I don't think so Debbie Roe

[02:24:25.860 --> 02:24:26.780]
Yeah, I'm a fish row

[02:24:27.540 --> 02:24:28.300]
How much boy?

[02:24:30.140 --> 02:24:34.400]
Lacks allegedly made the comments in a hearing last November connection with Jackson's oh well here you go

[02:24:34.400 --> 02:24:39.220]
She is do it. I told you they and connection with Jackson's custody of the people this former wife Debbie Roe

[02:24:39.220 --> 02:24:40.240]
Roe who is Jewish

[02:24:41.020 --> 02:24:45.660]
As they stress concern in the past about the religious influences honored children while in Jackson's care

[02:24:45.660 --> 02:24:49.400]
She ought to be word a lot more than about the religious influence if he catch my drift

[02:24:50.100 --> 02:24:50.940]
You know I'm saying

[02:24:51.720 --> 02:24:56.500]
Yeah, the paper is Jackson's lawyer Michael Abrams wrote drugs Lacks is Jewish as MI

[02:24:56.500 --> 02:24:58.300]
He's made me aware of this in the past

[02:24:58.300 --> 02:25:02.920]
I understand George Lacks concerned about anti-Semitism and anti-Israel sentiments which by the way

[02:25:02.920 --> 02:25:05.380]
There is absolutely no connection between those two

[02:25:06.540 --> 02:25:11.840]
Abrams takes issue with the comments alleged you know evidence was ever presented on issues of Jackson's legs anti-Semitism

[02:25:12.680 --> 02:25:15.880]
In fact just because he drinks that Jesus Jews

[02:25:16.580 --> 02:25:23.040]
Huh right that don't make him anti-Semitic doesn't last November ABC News Air phone messages in which Jackson allegedly said of Jews

[02:25:23.040 --> 02:25:25.500]
They suck they're like leeches. Ooh

[02:25:26.900 --> 02:25:30.220]
Last month Jackson's lawyer filed papers demanding that Lacks withdraw from the case

[02:25:30.220 --> 02:25:34.020]
He stepped down last month and the custody dispute is going on and Debbie Roe

[02:25:34.020 --> 02:25:39.360]
I wonder she's kind of Tommy Roe. He kind of makes me dizzy thinking about me. Tommy Roe and Dizzy. No come on

[02:31:42.330 --> 02:31:44.170]

When in doubt I'm gonna blurt it out you know

[02:31:53.950 --> 02:31:58.610]
Chucks a good guy and you just turned out a man you said they even like his food which you know heard his feeling

[02:31:58.610 --> 02:32:02.130]
I said I can't give you the free plug because I think that the audience might like his food

[02:32:02.130 --> 02:32:05.470]

[02:32:05.470 --> 02:32:08.130]
Well, I actually didn't send it somebody actually paid for it

[02:32:09.530 --> 02:32:10.150]

[02:32:13.230 --> 02:32:16.990]
God joys would have been foaming at the mouth if she'd been anywhere near me that I never met joys yet

[02:32:16.990 --> 02:32:18.170]
I understand she's a real beast

[02:32:20.350 --> 02:32:23.070]
Yeah, I always thought that one beast was enough at every station

[02:32:25.310 --> 02:32:29.530]
855 votes we're gonna make a thousand a day and spy on all this cock-a-writers going on

[02:32:29.530 --> 02:32:35.090]
It's part of our sports people like playing hard to get well at needle we don't we aren't gonna participate in that juvenile

[02:32:35.090 --> 02:32:37.990]
So okay, whatever and by the way you guys have been passed already

[02:32:37.990 --> 02:32:41.770]
You know the interesting part of it is and I'm sure that they're leaning heavily in the other place

[02:32:41.770 --> 02:32:44.970]
We have been passed by that much. I just took a look at a puke at a once

[02:32:45.950 --> 02:32:50.390]
That that's the sad part all the way we had even we had like almost 900 votes yesterday

[02:32:50.390 --> 02:32:53.190]
And then we got like I thought a little hundred something like that 12 whatever

[02:32:53.990 --> 02:32:58.770]
And that incredible we can have like five thousand now if we had like a little assistance man

[02:32:58.770 --> 02:33:05.090]
Everybody likes a little assistance and what do we get just totally a shine man the shiny remember the shining

[02:33:05.090 --> 02:33:07.970]
I told you wasn't all that good right. It's not we got shine

[02:33:10.330 --> 02:33:14.950]
God that's gonna be our full question where do we rather get your shoe shine or just shine in general by the

[02:33:14.970 --> 02:33:16.190]
sports advocate when

[02:33:17.510 --> 02:33:19.310]
Maybe they're afraid of the outcome

[02:33:20.090 --> 02:33:25.690]
Is the real ruggers oh my god is 516 qa

[02:33:26.390 --> 02:33:29.630]
Not just the one to two hour it's a phenomenon

[02:33:45.830 --> 02:33:47.850]
And better have me

[02:33:47.850 --> 02:33:51.450]
Please just think what do you call that a nice shack up

[02:33:55.690 --> 02:33:56.890]
And it lay

[02:33:58.890 --> 02:33:59.770]
You really know

[02:33:59.770 --> 02:34:10.390]
If it is time to pay

[02:34:11.370 --> 02:34:12.830]
For all your friends

[02:34:13.790 --> 02:34:18.830]
And pretty soon you will be serving hard time

[02:34:20.750 --> 02:34:21.810]

[02:34:23.870 --> 02:34:26.390]
You put him around in the red

[02:34:32.190 --> 02:34:34.430]
He can't wait

[02:34:36.270 --> 02:34:38.270]
Good of prison for a while

[02:34:45.250 --> 02:34:47.030]
You didn't pay

[02:34:48.410 --> 02:34:51.030]
Income you just in five

[02:34:57.710 --> 02:35:00.170]

And now you're going to the

[02:35:07.230 --> 02:35:08.090]
Peniculture

[02:35:10.410 --> 02:35:10.890]
You

[02:35:10.890 --> 02:35:16.390]
Stay in jail until you're dead

[02:35:19.710 --> 02:35:25.710]
103 is said to care carefully and Jeffrey showing stealing whatever name is it's a pretty sad and nobody cares

[02:35:25.710 --> 02:35:28.530]
That's what's even sadder except all them people lost their life savings

[02:35:28.530 --> 02:35:32.310]
So thanks to investing an in-ron because the gambling channel learned on the garden path

[02:35:32.310 --> 02:35:37.570]

Look at this here's a fax from dick

[02:35:42.930 --> 02:35:45.130]
Spell very bizarrely too, but anyway

[02:35:45.730 --> 02:35:49.130]
Glenn Campbell take guitar and almost every beach boys album in the 60s

[02:35:49.130 --> 02:35:52.210]
He also replaced Brian Wilson their touring band after Brian's initial

[02:35:52.970 --> 02:35:54.970]
Breakdown after Brian's teddy bear ran away

[02:35:55.770 --> 02:35:59.930]
Campbell was replaced by the I write the songs writer Bruce Johnson

[02:35:59.930 --> 02:36:05.070]
I'm ever Bruce Johnson and then it says Bob Cummings love that Bob and there's a picture of Bob Cummings

[02:36:05.070 --> 02:36:06.250]
I believe isn't that Bob Cummings

[02:36:07.050 --> 02:36:08.490]
That is Bob Cummings that's true

[02:36:10.530 --> 02:36:13.970]
That's Bob Cummings my right to song no, he don't sing our right to song

[02:36:13.970 --> 02:36:17.130]
Terry a very man was this and Bruce Johnson wrote it

[02:36:17.950 --> 02:36:19.870]
through very very the ferry

[02:36:20.530 --> 02:36:20.970]

My god, he's looking really bad. What he just do Tim on 96

[02:36:31.690 --> 02:36:33.810]
So the same thing that's been a second. Hey Barry

[02:36:34.450 --> 02:36:37.090]
And I know the course is good for Barry jackass very manlo

[02:36:37.090 --> 02:36:38.690]
a lot of buries

[02:36:39.510 --> 02:36:40.870]
Including a mole and his

[02:36:41.490 --> 02:36:42.610]
Dingle theories

[02:36:43.410 --> 02:36:46.050]
five six oh, it's big on a Diggle berries made his

[02:36:49.730 --> 02:36:50.790]
Reboa house said

[02:36:51.730 --> 02:36:55.590]
How said 39% approval rating and the Democrats are there

[02:36:55.590 --> 02:36:59.090]
Hey, can we please kiss your ass?

[02:36:59.250 --> 02:37:01.090]
When you can we be photographed with you?

[02:37:01.090 --> 02:37:06.450]
Or just in case just in case the poll numbers turn around can we go get a photo off they'll make me ill

[02:37:07.170 --> 02:37:10.110]
The politics in America suck. Okay, just remember that

[02:37:10.890 --> 02:37:16.510]
There's some you know there's some really incredibly courageous people like Cindy she and Michael more in about four

[02:37:16.510 --> 02:37:19.890]
Oh four or five others. Yeah, and that's it a friend howie

[02:37:20.850 --> 02:37:26.090]
Right howie Dean who every time he speaks all we don't want to do with him. He's out of control because he's speaking the truth right

[02:37:27.010 --> 02:37:29.890]
Howie Dean is the man. I've had telling you that I thought of that

[02:37:29.890 --> 02:37:32.390]
And in 2004 I told you that

[02:37:33.570 --> 02:37:39.410]
That John Kerry had about as much personality as a dead man. It's kind of like the Joseph Gackie of politics my god

[02:37:41.370 --> 02:37:44.190]
But no, oh that how we're Dean and remember what I told you?

[02:37:44.510 --> 02:37:51.350]
The Republicans were ecstatic as soon as howie Dean got made to look like a goofball. They were rubbing air hind legs together with clearance

[02:37:51.350 --> 02:37:53.910]
In fact, they were probably rubbing each other's hind legs

[02:37:55.730 --> 02:37:59.450]
For Canadian diplomats including the charge that fair to Iraq

[02:38:00.190 --> 02:38:04.350]
Escaped injury yesterday when their vehicle was shot at and bagged dead by US soldiers

[02:38:04.350 --> 02:38:09.770]
That'll hate that Paul Martin even though we ain't here no more. I don't think you're listening to be calling a president of moron

[02:38:10.570 --> 02:38:16.670]
Really that was crutch in it said that well whoever was a lot of them said that everybody in Canada says that a bus you're a moron

[02:38:17.930 --> 02:38:20.910]
The vehicle reportedly carrying charges of fair steward Henderson

[02:38:20.910 --> 02:38:26.690]
I wonder if he's came to Paul Henderson who scored that most important goal in the 72 Canada victory over the Russians and the Olympics

[02:38:27.710 --> 02:38:29.590]
Here's foster you with a call. I'm sorry

[02:38:30.130 --> 02:38:36.510]
The vehicle reportedly carrying steward Henderson came under friendly fire after it apparently attempted to pass American convoy

[02:38:36.510 --> 02:38:42.390]
Said US lieutenant Colonel Barry Johnson. Hey Barry you're fairy spoken for the multinational force in Iraq

[02:38:42.950 --> 02:38:48.270]
There were two convoy's were looking at the reason shots may have been fired so Johnson. I haven't seen the final report yet, eh

[02:38:49.110 --> 02:38:55.650]
However, however, military convoy's carrying markings warning that the common procedure is not to pass a precautioning and suicide bombers

[02:38:56.190 --> 02:39:01.550]
If vehicles fail to respond to hand signals followed by a fire followed by warning shots shots may be fired into vehicle

[02:39:01.550 --> 02:39:06.230]
He said Canadian US officials are investigating. I'm guarantee we're not gonna sit still for that up here

[02:39:06.230 --> 02:39:09.970]
Yeah, right, which we are we're gonna like turn a lot of wild geese with

[02:39:09.970 --> 02:39:15.590]
Burgflou loose on the ass and then some of them mook house man had cut that BSE whatever that is that mook house disease

[02:39:15.590 --> 02:39:18.910]
Oh the annual fear and toxic acid and

[02:39:19.950 --> 02:39:25.130]
Suffolite is a graphy ass. You're right your ass is grassy. Yeah, whatever it is grassy. No

[02:39:26.170 --> 02:39:26.610]
man

[02:39:26.610 --> 02:39:30.890]
I was speaking of grassy. No, I just had a thought but we can't say it. Yeah

[02:39:34.270 --> 02:39:37.650]
Wow ever have a grassy. No, mm-hmm my mind

[02:39:37.650 --> 02:39:41.310]
We got a grassy mole and wiki loaned it to me

[02:39:42.110 --> 02:39:47.250]
Came in a way man the male with a nice Christmas card. I guarantee you oh Jamie definitely didn't go no Christmas card from in greek

[02:39:47.250 --> 02:39:49.650]
Yeah, haha, and you're like that loser

[02:39:50.490 --> 02:39:55.170]
Also, I guarantee you that Greg Reed never sold no house to any of them. I'm letting toast over there

[02:39:56.270 --> 02:40:00.990]
You know the funny part of the thing is that they're convincing themselves that they're really hot stuff that they got something going

[02:40:00.990 --> 02:40:04.510]
And we know that that's not the case that that's the status part

[02:40:05.830 --> 02:40:09.550]
They're like having a party in their pants because they got the same five people right in craft

[02:40:10.230 --> 02:40:13.030]
Including our own fact boy by the way him. Let's know he's on the way out

[02:40:14.990 --> 02:40:22.730]
That that would give me sexual satisfaction that would just give me I would just I would rub my hind and front legs together. I'd be so excited

[02:40:24.130 --> 02:40:26.010]
Nobody Q. I. Am hello

[02:40:27.070 --> 02:40:34.870]
Neil yes sir. Oh, sorry. I didn't hear you there for a second. It's something interesting. You know that Bruce Johnson wrote that song for very man

[02:40:34.870 --> 02:40:40.630]
Well, there was something on the internet I read about it that came across and he said to this day

[02:40:41.110 --> 02:40:45.430]
He makes 250,000 dollars a year off that song. I write the songs

[02:40:45.430 --> 02:40:50.690]
Yeah, you wrote that about you wrote that song about Brian Johnson, but he's our upon yeah about Brian Wilson

[02:40:50.690 --> 02:40:56.410]
I'm sorry. You wrote it Brian Wilson. Right. He says that he says to this day through I guess residuals and whatever else

[02:40:56.410 --> 02:41:00.350]
He still makes 250 grand a year off that one song. What a guy huh?

[02:41:00.350 --> 02:41:02.270]
Not bad. Yeah, I know

[02:41:04.190 --> 02:41:10.630]
That people are actually buying that crap. That's really what's most amazing about it. Yeah, I can probably make this more from I guess

[02:41:10.630 --> 02:41:14.050]
Consular residuals because I he still draws a pretty good cross very man along

[02:41:14.050 --> 02:41:19.870]
We have to pay from that or whatever so yeah, I think it was gonna be like it to some of Poe don't go casino here in a couple weeks

[02:41:20.430 --> 02:41:25.910]
Yeah, yeah, hard rock is just a half-full house. Thanks for the loose valley. Thanks. That's all I got

[02:41:25.910 --> 02:41:30.490]
For like a bunch of old baghags show up to see Barry Manolo, you know, like oh, yeah guarantee you

[02:41:31.250 --> 02:41:36.970]
In fact, they're in Samuels probably shows up for all his concerts. Give them a big hug. Who can I hug your nose

[02:41:37.690 --> 02:41:41.050]

[02:41:47.490 --> 02:41:47.850]
I

[02:41:51.410 --> 02:41:51.770]
Yes

[02:41:55.910 --> 02:41:58.070]
Yeah

[02:42:25.910 --> 02:42:30.350]
If I have to fly, you too, I don't mind if we go away

[02:42:30.350 --> 02:42:34.630]
If you fly, I don't mind if we go away

[02:42:34.630 --> 02:42:39.170]
I'm the one who's really fine, I feel like a baby girl

[02:42:39.170 --> 02:42:44.290]
If you're proud, you're the baby girl

[02:42:44.290 --> 02:42:47.650]
If you're so mean, you're the one who's really good

[02:42:48.410 --> 02:42:52.430]
If I have to go on your steps all night and day

[02:42:52.430 --> 02:42:58.370]
If you can walk away, do the shopping rams for them

[02:42:58.370 --> 02:43:02.790]
If I can stand, I won't bother people anywhere

[02:43:03.430 --> 02:43:08.890]
I can't hide my tears, believe me, so what can you do?

[02:43:10.610 --> 02:43:13.330]
If I have to go on your steps all night and day

[02:43:13.330 --> 02:43:18.790]
If I have to go on your steps all night and day

[02:43:18.790 --> 02:43:23.170]
If I have to go on your steps all night

[02:43:23.170 --> 02:43:28.670]
I won't bother people anywhere

[02:43:28.670 --> 02:43:37.770]
I can't hide my tears, believe me, so what can you do?

[02:43:39.030 --> 02:43:41.170]
If I have to go on your steps all night

[02:43:41.170 --> 02:43:48.190]
If I have to go on your steps all night

[02:43:48.190 --> 02:43:51.750]
If I'm proud, you're the baby girl

[02:43:51.750 --> 02:43:55.810]
If you can walk away, do the shopping rams for them

[02:43:55.810 --> 02:44:01.270]
If I can stand, I won't bother people anywhere

[02:44:01.270 --> 02:44:06.430]
I can't hide my tears, believe me, so what can you do?

[02:44:06.450 --> 02:44:11.730]
If I'm crying, I'll go, tell my family

[02:44:19.290 --> 02:44:22.130]
So anyway, Ben Harper is great too, but he sings that scrappy music.

[02:44:22.190 --> 02:44:23.050]
Yeah, well, what are you going to do?

[02:44:23.050 --> 02:44:23.430]
Of a man.

[02:44:24.570 --> 02:44:24.890]
Huh?

[02:44:25.310 --> 02:44:26.010]
What are you going to do?

[02:44:26.430 --> 02:44:26.790]
I don't know.

[02:44:26.890 --> 02:44:28.510]
Maybe you like to send him some ideas.

[02:44:29.810 --> 02:44:30.450]
Some point.

[02:44:30.450 --> 02:44:32.370]
Yeah, obviously knows what good music sounds like.

[02:44:32.630 --> 02:44:32.750]
Yeah.

[02:44:32.810 --> 02:44:34.070]
Because he sure is how can sing it.

[02:44:34.110 --> 02:44:37.190]
But boy, he just, his own selection is kind of weak.

[02:44:37.310 --> 02:44:38.190]
Well, we're sorry about that.

[02:44:38.350 --> 02:44:38.690]
Sorry, Ben.

[02:44:39.190 --> 02:44:39.950]
He's great though.

[02:44:41.030 --> 02:44:44.070]
Anyway, standing in the shadows of Motown, I'm telling you, I'm begging you.

[02:44:44.250 --> 02:44:48.050]
I mean, we've probably turned down to some movies you hated over the years, but you won't

[02:44:48.050 --> 02:44:50.570]
hate that one unless, of course, you have no taste in music.

[02:44:50.850 --> 02:44:50.970]
Right.

[02:44:51.150 --> 02:44:51.630]
There's always that.

[02:44:52.070 --> 02:44:53.010]
There's always that problem.

[02:44:53.150 --> 02:44:54.190]
Unless you like very man-loathe.

[02:44:54.210 --> 02:44:56.950]
If you like very man-loathe, you'll probably hate this movie.

[02:44:58.050 --> 02:44:59.930]
When you think, oh, I don't know.

[02:45:00.110 --> 02:45:02.270]
And if you like very man-loathe, we probably hate you anyway.

[02:45:02.670 --> 02:45:06.250]
12 minutes after 1 at 5.60 WQAM, attention men.

[02:45:07.070 --> 02:45:08.590]
I never seemed I would be saying that.

[02:45:08.590 --> 02:45:10.690]
I only thought you said it all the time.

[02:45:10.930 --> 02:45:12.810]
No, I thought your buddy or his dad, he does.

[02:45:14.090 --> 02:45:14.750]
Attention, Ben.

[02:45:15.450 --> 02:45:16.130]
If you have a hair.

[02:45:16.170 --> 02:45:18.350]
Make sure gassoms, I fake foreplay.

[02:45:38.590 --> 02:45:41.130]
Make sure man-loathe, you bet.

[02:45:41.570 --> 02:45:43.350]
And carry him again.

[02:45:44.110 --> 02:45:45.770]
I still got away.

[02:45:46.570 --> 02:45:50.830]
But getting chicks wet, this is your holder.

[02:45:51.770 --> 02:45:53.770]
Then you're dead.

[02:45:54.930 --> 02:45:58.710]
So bear mostly all right.

[02:45:59.050 --> 02:46:04.110]
The last hit I had knew was in 172.

[02:46:04.110 --> 02:46:08.470]
I could get this.

[02:46:08.730 --> 02:46:11.310]
Chicks pass men across stage.

[02:46:11.850 --> 02:46:13.930]
Still one thousand's backstakes.

[02:46:14.290 --> 02:46:17.590]
So they can pinch my behind.

[02:46:19.150 --> 02:46:21.050]
I just have to round.

[02:46:21.890 --> 02:46:24.910]
When they ask if they can do.

[02:46:26.870 --> 02:46:27.390]
Me.

[02:46:28.150 --> 02:46:28.450]
Welcome.

[02:46:28.450 --> 02:46:34.630]
So we have been pulled back to no place.

[02:46:34.990 --> 02:46:39.050]
I still buy my old tracks.

[02:46:39.690 --> 02:46:44.790]
That's why I still do these concerts for you.

[02:46:46.010 --> 02:46:52.750]
I'd be on the street without you.

[02:46:53.770 --> 02:46:54.570]
You're fair.

[02:46:55.190 --> 02:46:56.670]
18 at 5.60.

[02:46:56.870 --> 02:46:57.490]
I'll take it one thing.

[02:46:57.490 --> 02:47:00.330]
There aren't too many guys who admit they like Barry Manelow.

[02:47:00.750 --> 02:47:01.110]
No.

[02:47:01.370 --> 02:47:04.830]
When I was a child, even when I was a child, those things were hits.

[02:47:05.090 --> 02:47:06.510]
There were songs of his that I didn't hate.

[02:47:07.410 --> 02:47:08.210]
But then I got older.

[02:47:08.430 --> 02:47:09.790]
Are you admitting you're like Barry Manelow?

[02:47:10.270 --> 02:47:10.570]
I think you're very.

[02:47:10.570 --> 02:47:10.610]
I'm not sure.

[02:47:11.510 --> 02:47:13.370]
And you're like Barry Manelow.

[02:47:13.770 --> 02:47:14.690]
Yeah, I'm good with that.

[02:47:15.450 --> 02:47:16.210]
Good with what?

[02:47:17.070 --> 02:47:17.630]
Not interested.

[02:47:18.590 --> 02:47:20.710]
I didn't ask you if you're interested in doing him or something.

[02:47:20.890 --> 02:47:22.370]
I just asked him if he liked any of his music.

[02:47:22.510 --> 02:47:23.770]
Was there any song that he ever sang?

[02:47:25.490 --> 02:47:26.090]
There you go.

[02:47:26.090 --> 02:47:26.570]
Oh, Mandy.

[02:47:28.650 --> 02:47:30.070]
Oh, God, that's so good.

[02:47:30.350 --> 02:47:30.410]
Huh?

[02:47:31.930 --> 02:47:32.370]
Horrible.

[02:47:33.570 --> 02:47:34.990]
He's a bad lounge act.

[02:47:37.390 --> 02:47:38.730]
Yeah, what's that one?

[02:47:40.470 --> 02:47:41.830]
I used to have to play this.

[02:47:42.170 --> 02:47:43.130]
I used to play this.

[02:47:43.130 --> 02:47:43.290]
No.

[02:47:44.210 --> 02:47:45.390]
It's got something that would be...

[02:47:45.390 --> 02:47:46.750]
He has to play a lot of Barry Manelow.

[02:47:47.050 --> 02:47:47.990]
I don't know what I recall.

[02:47:49.390 --> 02:47:50.130]
What is that?

[02:47:50.750 --> 02:47:51.210]
Big hit.

[02:47:51.850 --> 02:47:52.390]
What is it?

[02:47:52.550 --> 02:47:53.430]
It's the extended version.

[02:47:54.590 --> 02:47:55.490]
Oh, it could be hit.

[02:47:56.050 --> 02:47:56.370]
75.

[02:47:56.830 --> 02:47:57.790]
I think 75.

[02:47:58.690 --> 02:47:59.870]
That's really going to do it for me.

[02:48:01.350 --> 02:48:02.230]
It could be magic.

[02:48:03.270 --> 02:48:04.310]
Okay, it could be tragic.

[02:48:04.830 --> 02:48:04.830]

[02:48:05.330 --> 02:48:06.830]
In fact, I guarantee you won't hear that on bad.

[02:48:07.190 --> 02:48:08.110]
I'm not going to magic.

[02:48:08.570 --> 02:48:08.990]
Kill it.

[02:48:09.870 --> 02:48:11.130]
Good orbs, they say, in China.

[02:48:11.250 --> 02:48:11.710]
I'm not already.

[02:48:12.910 --> 02:48:14.390]
One house photographer is our life.

[02:48:15.010 --> 02:48:15.630]
You are.

[02:48:16.010 --> 02:48:17.490]
No wonder the camera says you like poison.

[02:48:17.570 --> 02:48:18.090]
He told me that.

[02:48:19.090 --> 02:48:22.030]
He said, next time that that little puss comes in here and starts giving me a lecture.

[02:48:23.150 --> 02:48:24.550]
We just had a chat, man.

[02:48:25.290 --> 02:48:25.710]
Yeah, right.

[02:48:25.830 --> 02:48:26.830]
You had a chat about what?

[02:48:26.970 --> 02:48:27.290]
Chat, man.

[02:48:27.290 --> 02:48:27.970]
How about that, man?

[02:48:28.070 --> 02:48:28.870]
Get out of here.

[02:48:29.010 --> 02:48:31.350]
Chat is about you and what a mean man you are.

[02:48:31.410 --> 02:48:31.590]
Good.

[02:48:31.810 --> 02:48:32.210]
I'm glad.

[02:48:32.830 --> 02:48:33.370]
I'm happy.

[02:48:33.690 --> 02:48:36.050]
You might want to keep those hate messages coming on that phone.

[02:48:36.130 --> 02:48:36.710]
How you can do it?

[02:48:36.810 --> 02:48:37.450]
I'm sure you can.

[02:48:37.450 --> 02:48:38.930]
I'm really, really, am used about that.

[02:48:39.090 --> 02:48:39.810]
Keep them coming, Stu.

[02:48:39.910 --> 02:48:41.190]
I was the only aunt of that.

[02:48:41.390 --> 02:48:42.130]
And Greg Kotex.

[02:48:42.250 --> 02:48:43.370]
And keep them coming, fat boy.

[02:48:44.050 --> 02:48:46.010]
I guess he wants to go work across the street, fat boy.

[02:48:46.070 --> 02:48:46.910]
He could walk all over there.

[02:48:47.570 --> 02:48:50.350]
In fact, I'm sure other people would love to give him my helping hand to put out a little

[02:48:50.350 --> 02:48:50.730]
push.

[02:48:50.730 --> 02:48:52.550]
I better be a long light if he's going to water over there.

[02:48:52.870 --> 02:48:53.810]
Give him a little push.

[02:48:54.690 --> 02:48:57.050]
White House Protagoners are looking for a hand out these days.

[02:48:57.150 --> 02:48:58.510]
In fact, they've gotten far too many.

[02:48:59.250 --> 02:49:03.050]
While the practice of providing news organizations with staged photos of events involving the

[02:49:03.050 --> 02:49:07.930]
President goes back decades, veteran shooters at 600 Pennsylvania Avenue says to come almost

[02:49:07.930 --> 02:49:10.210]
a regular recurrence with the Bush administration.

[02:49:11.150 --> 02:49:13.210]
Freedom is lost in the soul.

[02:49:13.970 --> 02:49:17.130]
A review of Associated Press Archive found that during the Atari years of Clinton

[02:49:17.130 --> 02:49:20.730]
administration, only a hundred handout photos of events released to the press during

[02:49:20.730 --> 02:49:24.790]
the first five years of Bush's presidency, more than 500 have been distributed.

[02:49:25.450 --> 02:49:28.310]
The key is that each of these events was closed to news photographers.

[02:49:29.270 --> 02:49:32.690]
The average is about two per week since the involved in AP photojournalist president of

[02:49:32.690 --> 02:49:35.950]
the White House News Photographers Association after directing their review.

[02:49:37.150 --> 02:49:40.050]
She said to White House staff, Dr. Hizrelle is to document the president.

[02:49:40.050 --> 02:49:44.510]
They've now crossed the line and become public relations photographers for the administration.

[02:49:45.490 --> 02:49:50.570]
With its lies and BS and the cover-ups and all these things.

[02:49:50.990 --> 02:49:51.870]
Get wound up here.

[02:49:52.130 --> 02:49:53.270]
Yeah, get wound up.

[02:49:53.930 --> 02:49:55.710]
And spin right on away, okay, like a dreidel.

[02:49:55.890 --> 02:49:58.050]
Like an out of control dreidel, spin out of our lives.

[02:49:58.890 --> 02:50:01.990]
Just like that whole deal in the right kind of like spinning out of control if you ask

[02:50:01.990 --> 02:50:02.190]
me.

[02:50:03.410 --> 02:50:06.470]
Five, six, seven, oh five, six, eight, pound, five, six, eight, and the rise in singular

[02:50:06.470 --> 02:50:06.770]
wireless.

[02:50:06.890 --> 02:50:08.910]
Well, I tell you one thing, I've sure made a big turn around today.

[02:50:09.390 --> 02:50:10.270]
I turned it right around.

[02:50:10.670 --> 02:50:10.970]
Well, good.

[02:50:10.970 --> 02:50:13.090]
Not the first time I've been at Harperpiece.

[02:50:13.250 --> 02:50:17.050]
I actually started getting dressed and getting ready for my big two o'clock run the wood

[02:50:17.050 --> 02:50:17.350]
vine.

[02:50:18.890 --> 02:50:20.230]
Man, can't wait.

[02:50:20.450 --> 02:50:23.770]
I'm going to be out there so fast before you can say Rumpel Stiltskin.

[02:50:24.850 --> 02:50:25.270]
Stiltskin.

[02:50:25.610 --> 02:50:25.970]
See ya.

[02:50:27.050 --> 02:50:28.010]
W-Q-I-N, hello.

[02:50:28.730 --> 02:50:30.010]
This is Limbaugh.

[02:50:30.450 --> 02:50:31.350]
Better, better, better, better, better.

[02:50:31.670 --> 02:50:32.750]
W-Q-I-N, hello.

[02:50:33.430 --> 02:50:33.830]
Daniel.

[02:50:34.610 --> 02:50:35.010]
Yes, sir.

[02:50:35.430 --> 02:50:38.610]
I'm not sure what you think about Keith Overrin, but you might want to check this out.

[02:50:38.610 --> 02:50:44.510]
He had a good ripping session of Bill O'Reilly on the little clips on the internet on Gorilla

[02:50:44.510 --> 02:50:44.890]
mask.

[02:50:44.890 --> 02:50:45.610]
Gorilla mask.

[02:50:45.770 --> 02:50:46.150]
I don't have a problem.

[02:50:46.330 --> 02:50:47.990]
Nobody watches anybody on MSNBC.

[02:50:48.290 --> 02:50:49.670]
I guess I'm the only one who watches him.

[02:50:49.870 --> 02:50:50.090]
And you?

[02:50:50.590 --> 02:50:51.210]
Did you see that?

[02:50:51.670 --> 02:50:51.870]
No.

[02:50:52.510 --> 02:50:53.250]
Well, check it out.

[02:50:53.330 --> 02:50:54.910]
It's on GorillaMask.net.

[02:50:55.210 --> 02:50:57.870]
It's under today's clips and you're going to kick out.

[02:50:57.970 --> 02:50:58.370]
It's pretty good.

[02:50:58.370 --> 02:50:58.550]
Okay.

[02:50:58.710 --> 02:50:59.230]
Thanks, Valley.

[02:50:59.370 --> 02:50:59.610]
All the way.

[02:50:59.610 --> 02:51:00.730]
I don't really care about Bill O'Reilly.

[02:51:00.850 --> 02:51:01.950]
All these people that are obsessed with it.

[02:51:02.090 --> 02:51:02.790]
I don't care about him.

[02:51:03.190 --> 02:51:03.650]
He's an idiot.

[02:51:04.150 --> 02:51:05.030]
He's an idiot.

[02:51:05.090 --> 02:51:06.390]
Anything to do with Foss, I'm not interested.

[02:51:06.930 --> 02:51:08.210]
It is what it is, you know.

[02:51:10.370 --> 02:51:13.190]
And by the way, Bill O'Reilly, you think the guy's across the street.

[02:51:13.190 --> 02:51:13.910]
He got bad numbers.

[02:51:14.070 --> 02:51:16.970]
How about that point that he's maintained consistently?

[02:51:17.270 --> 02:51:18.330]
He was going to crush Rush.

[02:51:18.510 --> 02:51:18.970]
Remember that?

[02:51:19.230 --> 02:51:23.290]
Well, because the Bill O'Reilly radio show, he's taking his stale foamy lying act, his

[02:51:23.290 --> 02:51:24.970]
mouth reading act, the radio.

[02:51:25.310 --> 02:51:26.730]
And in this market, he's made some impact.

[02:51:26.950 --> 02:51:29.030]
Well, if he took his phone calling act to radio, he'd have an audience.

[02:51:29.210 --> 02:51:29.650]
There you go.

[02:51:30.570 --> 02:51:32.430]
Oh, for lots of balls.

[02:51:32.450 --> 02:51:32.630]
Yeah.

[02:51:33.610 --> 02:51:34.850]
Are you saying for lots of balls?

[02:51:34.850 --> 02:51:35.330]
Yes.

[02:51:37.310 --> 02:51:38.290]
That was another one.

[02:51:38.370 --> 02:51:40.830]
You talk about middle-level management, paranoia.

[02:51:41.690 --> 02:51:42.470]
The Duffmeister.

[02:51:42.610 --> 02:51:45.070]
He thought that that one bit says something about Falavel's balls.

[02:51:46.490 --> 02:51:48.890]
I think he's confusing Falavel with Farfool.

[02:51:49.150 --> 02:51:50.110]
Remember, Farfool the dog?

[02:51:50.570 --> 02:51:50.870]
No.

[02:51:51.450 --> 02:51:53.230]
I think that was Paul Winchell that farfooled the dog.

[02:51:53.330 --> 02:51:54.610]
He's dead too, and so sure he lost.

[02:51:55.530 --> 02:51:56.830]
And it was a puppet.

[02:51:57.370 --> 02:51:58.130]
Farfool the dog.

[02:51:58.590 --> 02:51:59.550]
I'll take your word for it.

[02:51:59.630 --> 02:52:02.170]
And I think Duff has got his Farfool confused with Falavel.

[02:52:02.170 --> 02:52:03.270]
He's got his balls mixed up.

[02:52:03.270 --> 02:52:05.110]
You are not alone, guys.

[02:52:06.110 --> 02:52:06.870]
You're fairy.

[02:52:07.290 --> 02:52:08.570]
Nobody QAM, hello.

[02:52:08.570 --> 02:52:09.170]
I'm kind of annoying.

[02:52:10.490 --> 02:52:10.910]
QAM.

[02:52:11.130 --> 02:52:11.870]
You don't have to be one of them.

[02:52:11.870 --> 02:52:12.750]
A little neil about you.

[02:52:12.790 --> 02:52:13.230]
Yes, sir.

[02:52:13.550 --> 02:52:16.370]
Yeah, just seeing if you watched the president last night, did you

[02:52:16.370 --> 02:52:16.510]
get that?

[02:52:16.510 --> 02:52:18.390]
It was the last 10 minutes it was pathetic, yes.

[02:52:18.850 --> 02:52:21.270]
I have to equate it to an AMWA convention.

[02:52:21.750 --> 02:52:23.670]
It was very similar.

[02:52:23.950 --> 02:52:26.750]
There was a lot of ass-grabbing and...

[02:52:26.750 --> 02:52:26.930]
Right.

[02:52:27.910 --> 02:52:31.650]
A lot of cheering and yelling and gung-ho, rah-rah-sis for Bob.

[02:52:32.150 --> 02:52:32.150]

[02:52:32.150 --> 02:52:32.610]
Yeah.

[02:52:32.910 --> 02:52:33.270]
Exactly.

[02:52:33.690 --> 02:52:35.610]
How about those courageous Democrats, man?

[02:52:35.710 --> 02:52:36.650]
Are they going to be a boxer?

[02:52:36.810 --> 02:52:37.310]
Yeah, they're not mad.

[02:52:37.750 --> 02:52:40.990]
Let me ask you, Neal, what's respect to your wardrobe?

[02:52:41.210 --> 02:52:42.630]
Have you, like, trucking?

[02:52:42.630 --> 02:52:43.490]
Yeah, my wardrobe, yeah.

[02:52:43.850 --> 02:52:47.530]
5.6705.6, and that's the guy always starts out with some other phony premise.

[02:52:47.890 --> 02:52:50.150]
In respect of my wardrobe, I'm sitting around in my underwear.

[02:52:50.390 --> 02:52:51.030]
Okay, that's...

[02:52:51.030 --> 02:52:53.010]
Just get that vision in your mind, okay?

[02:52:53.510 --> 02:52:54.870]
It'll get you going on a good diet.

[02:52:54.990 --> 02:52:55.570]
You lose a lot of weight.

[02:52:55.690 --> 02:52:59.650]
Keep thinking about me sitting around in my boxer shorts with my big, perfect hanging out here.

[02:52:59.910 --> 02:53:00.490]
That's my wardrobe.

[02:53:00.490 --> 02:53:02.290]
Are those the plaid or polka dot-blogs?

[02:53:02.330 --> 02:53:04.250]
These are the plaid ones.

[02:53:04.770 --> 02:53:06.650]
In fact, no, actually, these are the checkered ones.

[02:53:06.770 --> 02:53:08.430]
Let's send you some power ranger about their shorts.

[02:53:08.690 --> 02:53:09.610]
Oh, I can't wait to get it.

[02:53:10.330 --> 02:53:11.670]
Take off those checkered pants.

[02:53:11.770 --> 02:53:13.570]
No chance in my pants.

[02:53:14.090 --> 02:53:18.390]
5.6705.6, Tom 5.6, and they've arrived in Singular Rival's line.

[02:53:18.690 --> 02:53:19.470]
One dimensional man.

[02:53:19.770 --> 02:53:23.910]
And in regards to your wardrobe, yeah, I'm not going to impress anybody with my wardrobe, okay?

[02:53:24.210 --> 02:53:25.990]
I'm a doubty old fat bag.

[02:53:26.110 --> 02:53:26.490]
And that's fine.

[02:53:26.610 --> 02:53:27.270]
I'm doing just great.

[02:53:27.450 --> 02:53:27.870]
No complaints.

[02:53:28.190 --> 02:53:28.330]
None.

[02:53:28.330 --> 02:53:29.350]
Except this place.

[02:53:30.190 --> 02:53:31.450]
Except your place.

[02:53:31.770 --> 02:53:33.370]
Oh my god, that place.

[02:53:35.150 --> 02:53:37.210]
Remember I was talking yesterday about the place for steak?

[02:53:37.650 --> 02:53:37.790]
Yeah.

[02:53:38.230 --> 02:53:39.510]
We're changing the front of the building.

[02:53:39.510 --> 02:53:40.250]
We're going to set a QA.

[02:53:40.250 --> 02:53:41.650]
It's going to say the place for agida.

[02:53:43.010 --> 02:53:44.190]
Somebody QA.M. Hello?

[02:53:45.550 --> 02:53:46.430]
Neil, how's it going?

[02:53:46.930 --> 02:53:47.250]
All right.

[02:53:48.130 --> 02:53:52.570]
Excuse the noise in the background about a pool of these bastard land capers.

[02:53:52.750 --> 02:53:53.410]
Got the thing in the background.

[02:53:53.410 --> 02:53:54.070]
I'm going to throw it in the background.

[02:53:54.070 --> 02:53:56.130]
You sound like you're in a right next door.

[02:53:56.130 --> 02:53:57.390]
Stella, you're on my balcony.

[02:53:57.950 --> 02:53:59.150]
Oh, it's going to start.

[02:54:01.190 --> 02:54:01.570]
It's going to start.

[02:54:01.690 --> 02:54:01.950]
Yeah.

[02:54:01.950 --> 02:54:03.410]
Oh, great.

[02:54:04.110 --> 02:54:05.810]
That was so horrible last night.

[02:54:06.050 --> 02:54:08.090]
I can not believe she was pushing up.

[02:54:09.530 --> 02:54:10.990]
He had to answer for everything.

[02:54:11.210 --> 02:54:12.230]
He had to answer for our future.

[02:54:12.470 --> 02:54:15.670]
He was going to solve all of what problems in one hour.

[02:54:16.270 --> 02:54:16.410]
Right.

[02:54:16.410 --> 02:54:18.630]
All these time frames he's got for everything.

[02:54:19.190 --> 02:54:20.010]
It was such a joke.

[02:54:20.050 --> 02:54:22.070]
He's got the answer for everything except those elections.

[02:54:22.310 --> 02:54:23.710]
They can fix in all those era of states.

[02:54:23.710 --> 02:54:26.110]
They're going to go democratic with all those terrorists winning elections.

[02:54:26.110 --> 02:54:26.110]

[02:54:26.110 --> 02:54:29.630]

Thanks a lot.

[02:57:33.750 --> 02:57:34.490]
I'm not dying.

[02:57:34.690 --> 02:57:35.470]
I'm putting it down.

[02:57:35.710 --> 02:57:36.330]
Drop your pants.

[02:57:37.050 --> 02:57:38.430]
I said drop your pants.

[02:57:38.770 --> 02:57:39.710]
That hasn't been more gentle.

[02:57:39.950 --> 02:57:41.790]
Give you something to do while you're watching golf.

[02:57:42.170 --> 02:57:42.530]
My good.

[02:57:42.830 --> 02:57:44.570]
Pouring the hot liquid in your eye.

[02:57:44.570 --> 02:57:45.910]
I like this.

[02:57:45.950 --> 02:57:46.430]
Ah!

[02:57:46.970 --> 02:57:48.310]
I'm going to the door.

[02:57:48.510 --> 02:57:48.590]
The door.

[02:57:48.590 --> 02:57:48.810]
The door.

[02:57:49.230 --> 02:57:49.630]
Oops.

[02:57:50.170 --> 02:57:53.470]
And I look like I made no kind of your pants on.

[02:57:53.650 --> 02:57:54.330]
Now, pin right.

[02:57:54.750 --> 02:57:56.210]
You want to walk my show?

[02:57:56.710 --> 02:57:57.510]
You'll do as you told.

[02:57:58.050 --> 02:57:58.930]
Now get over here.

[02:57:59.270 --> 02:57:59.910]
Yeah, that's right.

[02:58:00.370 --> 02:58:01.210]
Now come here.

[02:58:01.590 --> 02:58:02.310]
Now get over there.

[02:58:02.750 --> 02:58:03.450]
Come here.

[02:58:04.370 --> 02:58:04.850]
Now come here.

[02:58:05.070 --> 02:58:05.530]
Come over here.

[02:58:05.690 --> 02:58:06.050]
Up here.

[02:58:06.470 --> 02:58:07.010]
Over here.

[02:58:07.210 --> 02:58:07.290]
Oh.

[02:58:07.950 --> 02:58:09.870]
So the pizza.

[02:58:10.350 --> 02:58:10.450]
No.

[02:58:10.790 --> 02:58:11.870]
I did not steal the pizza.

[02:58:11.870 --> 02:58:14.050]
I stole the pizza.

[02:58:14.850 --> 02:58:15.610]
Now see here.

[02:58:16.030 --> 02:58:17.230]
I ain't no pipe, I learned.

[02:58:17.610 --> 02:58:18.630]
You're all the pizza.

[02:58:18.990 --> 02:58:20.170]
I did not steal the pizza.

[02:58:20.170 --> 02:58:20.730]
I did not steal the pizza.

[02:58:20.730 --> 02:58:21.830]
You only have one slice.

[02:58:22.190 --> 02:58:23.750]
Put your headphones on the glass door.

[02:58:23.990 --> 02:58:25.050]
See if anybody's inside.

[02:58:25.370 --> 02:58:25.550]
No.

[02:58:25.950 --> 02:58:26.750]
Close it.

[02:58:26.930 --> 02:58:27.390]
Close it.

[02:58:27.470 --> 02:58:28.070]
A little closer.

[02:58:28.150 --> 02:58:28.810]
I hate it.

[02:58:28.810 --> 02:58:30.150]
I hate it.

[02:58:30.150 --> 02:58:31.310]
I hate it.

[02:58:31.810 --> 02:58:32.950]
Leave me.

[02:58:33.070 --> 02:58:33.410]
Oh.

[02:58:34.970 --> 02:58:36.190]
You're a tough guy.

[02:58:36.730 --> 02:58:38.650]
Why are you a tough guy?

[02:58:39.370 --> 02:58:40.470]
Why are you a tough guy?

[02:58:40.470 --> 02:58:41.810]
Now see here.

[02:58:42.190 --> 02:58:42.190]

[02:58:44.570 --> 02:58:45.910]
I got it right there.

[02:58:46.030 --> 02:58:46.170]
Stop.

[02:58:46.290 --> 02:58:47.190]
I get stuck beside.

[02:58:47.670 --> 02:58:48.430]
I have a little hope.

[02:58:48.730 --> 02:58:49.290]
See here.

[02:58:49.470 --> 02:58:51.230]
I stand before you now.

[02:58:52.170 --> 02:58:53.510]
Let me glitch with my son.

[02:58:53.970 --> 02:58:54.430]
I have a door.

[02:58:55.090 --> 02:58:55.650]
I have a door.

[02:58:58.230 --> 02:59:00.370]
Well, perhaps you'll garner my,

[02:59:00.610 --> 02:59:02.150]
you'll garner my, totally.

[02:59:02.770 --> 02:59:04.070]
I don't like all of that, totally.

[02:59:04.530 --> 02:59:06.330]
Yeah, I don't want you to, totally, it's over me.

[02:59:06.450 --> 02:59:07.910]
It's not, it's not, it's not.

[02:59:09.210 --> 02:59:10.610]
I'll never fight me.

[02:59:10.910 --> 02:59:11.110]
Yes.

[02:59:12.950 --> 02:59:15.550]
Of course it's more important that I have lived you.

[02:59:15.890 --> 02:59:16.770]
Why I'll have you now?

[02:59:17.110 --> 02:59:18.690]
No, it's, I go home now.

[02:59:18.870 --> 02:59:19.350]
I'm going short.

[02:59:19.930 --> 02:59:21.270]
Watch out for Mr. Whipple.

[02:59:21.710 --> 02:59:22.030]
Squeeze.

[02:59:23.170 --> 02:59:24.270]
Oh, no, squeeze.

[02:59:24.930 --> 02:59:25.590]
That's a choice.

[02:59:26.110 --> 02:59:26.550]
It's more.

[02:59:26.850 --> 02:59:27.770]
That's a choice.

[02:59:28.950 --> 02:59:30.410]
That's a choice.

[02:59:30.710 --> 02:59:32.630]
I got a bonus.

[02:59:33.070 --> 02:59:34.090]
That's what I say.

[02:59:34.490 --> 02:59:35.150]
Hey, miss Maya.

[02:59:35.330 --> 02:59:35.610]
Hey, man.

[02:59:36.510 --> 02:59:37.370]
134, a big target.

[02:59:37.570 --> 02:59:38.330]
26 to the two.

[02:59:38.390 --> 02:59:40.270]
I sure hope you claim the dingover is off first.

[02:59:41.270 --> 02:59:43.230]
By the way, that Keith Overman thing is pretty funny.

[02:59:43.950 --> 02:59:44.470]
What is that?

[02:59:44.590 --> 02:59:45.290]
I want to check that out.

[02:59:45.410 --> 02:59:46.190]
About the bill of Riley.

[02:59:46.470 --> 02:59:46.570]
Yeah.

[02:59:47.030 --> 02:59:47.590]
El Paso.

[02:59:49.030 --> 02:59:51.050]
No, I first, I knew like Keith Overman a lot,

[02:59:51.230 --> 02:59:52.810]
but anything new with Bill Riley El Paso.

[02:59:53.390 --> 02:59:54.770]
951, we're not going to make that thousand.

[02:59:54.790 --> 02:59:56.470]
We got 25 minutes for 49 votes.

[02:59:56.630 --> 02:59:57.110]
That's two a minute.

[02:59:57.230 --> 02:59:58.150]
Can we do that? I doubt it.

[02:59:59.090 --> 03:00:00.370]
We were doing yesterday, but yesterday.

[03:00:00.550 --> 03:00:02.930]
And by the way, Dave Friedman and Fanboy are like,

[03:00:02.930 --> 03:00:05.990]
uh, Friedman all over would come in at the Grand Code Texting.

[03:00:06.150 --> 03:00:07.110]
Keep him off the street.

[03:00:07.290 --> 03:00:07.850]
Better than the mess.

[03:00:08.350 --> 03:00:09.130]
Oh, trust me.

[03:00:09.470 --> 03:00:10.210]
Most amusing.

[03:00:11.150 --> 03:00:13.850]
And what do I, what do I always told you about those things?

[03:00:14.510 --> 03:00:17.470]
They, they, they, they, zero way and they wander away from whatever the original

[03:00:17.470 --> 03:00:18.670]
deal was supposed to be here.

[03:00:18.970 --> 03:00:22.230]
And all of a sudden they start shouting at each other in his back and forth.

[03:00:22.510 --> 03:00:24.230]
And it's a place for miss kids, you know.

[03:00:24.610 --> 03:00:26.090]
So I'm glad that they found a place to go.

[03:00:26.950 --> 03:00:29.450]
Who is the biggest no talent celebrity of all time?

[03:00:29.470 --> 03:00:30.990]
We got 951 votes.

[03:00:31.030 --> 03:00:31.570]
Is that what you got?

[03:00:32.350 --> 03:00:33.710]
Cause this is going to be tight.

[03:00:34.610 --> 03:00:35.050]
951.

[03:00:35.570 --> 03:00:36.270]
Oh no.

[03:00:37.190 --> 03:00:38.570]
952, I got reloaded.

[03:00:39.310 --> 03:00:42.990]
Paris Hilton 297, Rosio Donnelly, 85, Ashley Simpson, 74.

[03:00:43.370 --> 03:00:44.370]
I hate this Pearl 72.

[03:00:44.990 --> 03:00:45.170]
Of course.

[03:00:45.970 --> 03:00:48.930]
P. Diddy 71, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Arnold's God.

[03:00:49.070 --> 03:00:49.990]
About 30, man.

[03:00:50.350 --> 03:00:53.550]
K-126, Torrey Spelling 24, Adam Sandberg 24.

[03:00:54.670 --> 03:00:56.910]
Brittany Spears 17, L.M.D. General 17.

[03:00:57.370 --> 03:01:01.190]
Dr. Phil 16, our city of Hall 16, Ed Solomon 16,

[03:01:01.190 --> 03:01:03.630]
Stostelo 16, Wayne Newton 15,

[03:01:04.450 --> 03:01:08.350]
Ben Acto like 14, Snoop Dogg, Hannah Reeves, and Tony Danza, doesn't a piece.

[03:01:08.890 --> 03:01:12.470]
Van A White and Yine, Madonna, and Wippie Goldberg, he had a piece same person.

[03:01:13.170 --> 03:01:19.010]
J-107, Oprah 6, Courtney Love 6, Frank Sinatra 6, Emre LaGasse 6, Bob Villain 6,

[03:01:19.490 --> 03:01:25.570]
Ozzy Osborne 6, Rita Cards B5, Courtney Cards, Four Martha Stewart 2, Gary Moore's got a pair too.

[03:01:26.570 --> 03:01:30.490]
William Shatner 2, Bruce Willis 2, Tab Hars got one, and Dean Martin still got the big one.

[03:01:32.990 --> 03:01:34.430]
Oh, I don't think we're going to make that thousand.

[03:01:34.430 --> 03:01:35.610]
It's going to be Josh's fault.

[03:01:36.330 --> 03:01:37.690]
I agree. Sorry.

[03:01:38.390 --> 03:01:40.490]
I'll tell you what, when he told me this morning was so depressing,

[03:01:40.830 --> 03:01:41.810]
9.58 we got a shot.

[03:01:42.550 --> 03:01:43.390]
We're so depressing.

[03:01:44.550 --> 03:01:47.950]
Yeah, because in other words, if we got the new people are lying to me also,

[03:01:48.110 --> 03:01:50.090]
then that proves beyond a shadow of a doubt.

[03:01:50.150 --> 03:01:51.070]
There's absolutely no hope.

[03:01:52.350 --> 03:01:52.870]
You know what I'm saying?

[03:01:53.590 --> 03:01:53.870]
What do you say?

[03:01:54.150 --> 03:01:56.430]
There was one thing about the old regime we were used to them lying.

[03:01:56.550 --> 03:01:59.270]
But if I've been led down to Garden Path and given a saw in dance,

[03:01:59.270 --> 03:02:01.810]
then come to find out, well, that's not exactly true.

[03:02:02.090 --> 03:02:03.670]
Well, you know what, to hell with it.

[03:02:03.850 --> 03:02:04.550]
To hell with it.

[03:02:05.210 --> 03:02:08.010]
I'll go out and sell crispy cream donuts on the street corner if I have to.

[03:02:08.090 --> 03:02:08.530]
How do you like that?

[03:02:08.730 --> 03:02:09.450]
You'll be selling them.

[03:02:10.150 --> 03:02:10.890]
How big of a pardon?

[03:02:11.070 --> 03:02:11.590]
You'll be eating them.

[03:02:13.070 --> 03:02:13.710]
All for me.

[03:02:15.830 --> 03:02:17.210]
Dominatrix acquitted and clients death.

[03:02:18.310 --> 03:02:22.610]
In a dead of mass, a Dominatrix was acquitted of manslaughter Monday,

[03:02:22.730 --> 03:02:25.370]
and the death of a man who prosecuted, say, suffered a heart attack

[03:02:25.370 --> 03:02:27.430]
while strapped to a replica of a medieval rack.

[03:02:28.630 --> 03:02:28.970]
All right.

[03:02:30.890 --> 03:02:35.310]
Barbara Asher, a 56-year-old woman who calls herself Mistress Lauren M.,

[03:02:35.310 --> 03:02:38.510]
was also cleared of dismembering the man's corpse to conceal the death.

[03:02:40.530 --> 03:02:43.990]
Prosecutors said that 52-year-old Michael Lourd suffered a heart attack in 2000

[03:02:43.990 --> 03:02:47.570]
during a bondage session in a dungeon in Asher's condominium.

[03:02:48.670 --> 03:02:50.870]
Asher was accused of doing nothing to help him for five minutes,

[03:02:51.250 --> 03:02:52.730]
fearing authorities would discover her penis.

[03:02:53.910 --> 03:02:56.050]
Asher had her boyfriend chop off the body.

[03:02:56.050 --> 03:02:56.510]
There he goes.

[03:02:56.730 --> 03:02:58.050]
That's sound again.

[03:02:59.390 --> 03:03:02.390]
He took 175 five retired telephone company worker.

[03:03:02.470 --> 03:03:04.170]
They dumped it behind a restaurant in Maine.

[03:03:04.690 --> 03:03:06.330]
His remains have not been found.

[03:03:07.210 --> 03:03:09.110]
While they dumped it behind a restaurant, maybe he's done a menu.

[03:03:09.570 --> 03:03:11.170]
I hope that was a Chinese restaurant.

[03:03:12.450 --> 03:03:14.370]
Prosecutors said Asher confessed to police,

[03:03:14.510 --> 03:03:15.810]
but the alleged confession wasn't taped.

[03:03:16.190 --> 03:03:18.190]
Investigators testified they did not say their notes.

[03:03:18.450 --> 03:03:19.210]
Ain't good investigation.

[03:03:20.350 --> 03:03:21.790]
Kind of like what Congress is doing,

[03:03:21.890 --> 03:03:24.870]
all these are committee hearings 9-11 and Katrina.

[03:03:25.550 --> 03:03:27.110]
All these hearings all the time.

[03:03:27.250 --> 03:03:28.130]
Not a damn thing happens.

[03:03:29.170 --> 03:03:31.350]
Asher's lawyer Stephanie Pade said there was nothing to prove

[03:03:31.350 --> 03:03:32.350]
Laura was even dead.

[03:03:32.730 --> 03:03:34.710]
Nobody, no blood, no DNA.

[03:03:36.030 --> 03:03:37.670]
During his closing argument of the jury,

[03:03:37.810 --> 03:03:39.890]
prosecutor Robert Nelson put on a black leather mask

[03:03:39.890 --> 03:03:42.790]
with zippered mouth opening and re-enacted the bondage session.

[03:03:42.790 --> 03:03:46.710]
If I start a picture of it right here, he re-enacted the opening.

[03:03:46.710 --> 03:03:49.850]
With both hands, he reached back and took the top of a blackboard

[03:03:49.850 --> 03:03:51.430]
as if strapped to the rack.

[03:03:51.730 --> 03:03:52.930]
Then he hung his head as if dead.

[03:03:53.930 --> 03:03:55.830]
Asher's lawyer objected to Judge Agreed.

[03:03:56.010 --> 03:03:58.090]
That's enough Mr. Nelson Judge Charles Greybo said.

[03:03:58.450 --> 03:03:59.350]
Thank you for your demonstration.

[03:04:00.230 --> 03:04:01.990]
Judge Charles Nelson Riley said.

[03:04:03.010 --> 03:04:03.770]
He's still alive?

[03:04:04.170 --> 03:04:04.910]
Charles Nelson Riley?

[03:04:05.210 --> 03:04:05.610]
I'm Charlie.

[03:04:05.810 --> 03:04:06.110]
You can't say.

[03:04:06.410 --> 03:04:07.510]
Oh yeah, you don't think so?

[03:04:08.110 --> 03:04:08.890]
Get out of here.

[03:04:09.010 --> 03:04:09.490]
You're crazy.

[03:04:09.710 --> 03:04:10.550]
Do a Google on a man.

[03:04:10.910 --> 03:04:12.510]
Charles Nelson Riley is alive and kicking.

[03:04:12.630 --> 03:04:14.490]
He's kicking an old ancient style.

[03:04:16.290 --> 03:04:16.730]
Crazy.

[03:04:17.030 --> 03:04:19.170]
You better start learning your game show people

[03:04:19.170 --> 03:04:20.370]
because you sure don't know Mr.

[03:04:21.970 --> 03:04:24.050]
972 we got a shot at a thousand today during the show.

[03:04:24.270 --> 03:04:26.230]
That would redeem the whole deal.

[03:04:26.510 --> 03:04:29.590]
That would make up for Todd Dreck and for Fat Boy

[03:04:29.590 --> 03:04:33.290]
and for your buddy, let's see, Dave Friedman.

[03:04:33.870 --> 03:04:34.310]
974.

[03:04:35.430 --> 03:04:36.890]
26 votes in 21 minutes.

[03:04:37.050 --> 03:04:38.390]
That just barely won more than one minute.

[03:04:39.050 --> 03:04:41.370]
I think Josh is feeling fairly confident at this point.

[03:04:41.370 --> 03:04:43.570]
Fundamental incident of war.

[03:04:43.770 --> 03:04:44.410]
Yeah, okay.

[03:04:44.530 --> 03:04:45.310]
He's not dead.

[03:04:47.070 --> 03:04:48.630]
Oh Charles Nelson Riley, I told you.

[03:04:48.770 --> 03:04:48.990]
Right.

[03:04:49.150 --> 03:04:49.610]
Told you so.

[03:04:49.850 --> 03:04:50.070]
Yep.

[03:04:51.750 --> 03:04:52.430]
WQYM, hello.

[03:04:54.550 --> 03:04:56.450]
Mama always said you already

[03:04:56.450 --> 03:04:57.890]
and probably like a bomb.

[03:04:58.270 --> 03:04:58.890]
A chocolate flip.

[03:04:59.250 --> 03:04:59.930]
WQYM, hello.

[03:05:00.590 --> 03:05:02.010]
For the porn, pick your buy.

[03:05:02.170 --> 03:05:03.530]
Look at the QQY, restrict.

[03:05:04.190 --> 03:05:04.870]
Mark him.

[03:05:07.790 --> 03:05:08.930]
Oh geez, time's up.

[03:05:08.930 --> 03:05:11.490]
This is Neil Rogers.

[03:05:12.310 --> 03:05:15.330]
This is 5.60 QA.

[03:05:16.450 --> 03:05:18.630]
Suck it in and hold it.

[03:05:19.010 --> 03:05:21.270]
Roe Winfrey, what did you do?

[03:05:21.710 --> 03:05:24.570]
To just get a book that wasn't quite true.

[03:05:25.150 --> 03:05:27.730]
Oh Roe Winfrey defended James Fry.

[03:05:28.370 --> 03:05:31.310]
So we told the Millions little lies.

[03:05:31.610 --> 03:05:34.230]
He wrote a book about his time and rehab.

[03:05:34.730 --> 03:05:37.670]
But now it seems that we've all been had.

[03:05:37.670 --> 03:05:40.630]
Next we'll find out he never stole it.

[03:05:41.110 --> 03:05:45.050]
He was addicted to collecting stamps.

[03:05:45.630 --> 03:05:47.690]
I think that he's full of it.

[03:05:47.830 --> 03:05:50.390]
For Roe Winfrey, what should we do?

[03:05:50.750 --> 03:05:53.730]
We only read books that you tell us to.

[03:05:54.170 --> 03:05:57.030]
Maybe you are the one who's on drugs

[03:05:57.030 --> 03:05:59.090]
for pulling his book in.

[03:05:59.990 --> 03:06:00.890]
Over the blood.

[03:06:06.030 --> 03:06:07.410]
Over the blood.

[03:06:07.410 --> 03:06:10.170]
I'm 189, but we only need 11 more for 1000.

[03:06:10.250 --> 03:06:11.930]
We get 1000 before 2 o'clock.

[03:06:11.950 --> 03:06:12.770]
We will be free.

[03:06:12.850 --> 03:06:14.030]
That will set us free, won't it?

[03:06:14.730 --> 03:06:15.530]
Well, no.

[03:06:16.010 --> 03:06:18.170]
Oh yes, it's going to set my ass free.

[03:06:19.070 --> 03:06:20.350]
Good God, it bound up.

[03:06:21.010 --> 03:06:22.610]
Norman Solomon, no not legally.

[03:06:22.810 --> 03:06:23.630]
In fact, quite the opposite.

[03:06:23.970 --> 03:06:26.010]
Norman Solomon writes, the Wednesday Solomon,

[03:06:26.270 --> 03:06:27.530]
what did I say? Abraham Solomon.

[03:06:28.230 --> 03:06:30.590]
The domestic line, the question that journalists don't ask bush.

[03:06:31.370 --> 03:06:32.450]
That's the story to do there.

[03:06:32.610 --> 03:06:35.210]
How long has he been speaking here about five hours?

[03:06:36.010 --> 03:06:39.110]
I think we got a whole new format now on the talking head network.

[03:06:39.110 --> 03:06:40.410]
We got all bush all day.

[03:06:40.590 --> 03:06:41.150]
Get out of here.

[03:06:41.230 --> 03:06:42.730]
I'm through a lot of manure to slay.

[03:06:42.810 --> 03:06:45.170]
I'm through some city pulse comedian thing, eh?

[03:06:45.590 --> 03:06:47.910]
There's day after the death of a man.

[03:06:48.070 --> 03:06:48.570]
There you go.

[03:06:49.390 --> 03:06:53.290]
With great fanfare, the ability Oprah Winfrey asked James Fry a question.

[03:06:53.430 --> 03:06:55.710]
That mainstream journalist refused to ask George W. Bush.

[03:06:55.990 --> 03:06:56.750]
Why would you lie?

[03:06:58.250 --> 03:07:02.090]
Many pundits in New Zealand have totaled that the televised on asking a fry is a liar.

[03:07:02.090 --> 03:07:05.970]
The reverberations have spanned from schlock media to highbrow outlets.

[03:07:06.450 --> 03:07:10.090]
On Friday, the PBS News Hour with Jim Lerard devoted an entire segment to what happened.

[03:07:10.650 --> 03:07:14.390]
The New York Times supplemented its page one coverage with an editorial that concluded,

[03:07:14.670 --> 03:07:18.870]
Ms. Winfrey gave the audience, including us, what I was hoping for a demand to hear the truth.

[03:07:19.970 --> 03:07:23.170]
A key reality at the National Security Agency's spying story is,

[03:07:23.670 --> 03:07:27.510]
President Bush lied, but routinely missing from media coverage is a demand to hear the truth.

[03:07:28.290 --> 03:07:31.650]
More than two years after he started the NSA's domestic spying without war,

[03:07:31.650 --> 03:07:36.650]
and Bush was unequivocal during a speech in Buffalo, April 20th of 2004, he said,

[03:07:37.430 --> 03:07:39.810]
any time he heard the US government talking about a wiretap,

[03:07:39.810 --> 03:07:42.230]
it requires a wiretap requires a court order.

[03:07:42.530 --> 03:07:43.770]
Nothing is changed, by the way.

[03:07:44.090 --> 03:07:48.790]
When we're talking about chasing down terrorists, we're talking about getting a court order before we do so. His words.

[03:07:49.190 --> 03:07:51.550]
There are such things as roving wiretaps.

[03:07:51.970 --> 03:07:55.250]
Fry lied about his personal life in a book and that infuriated Oprah Winfrey.

[03:07:55.610 --> 03:07:58.690]
It is difficult for me to talk to you because I really feel duked, as he said,

[03:07:58.690 --> 03:08:01.270]
confronting him in the midst of the January 26th telecast,

[03:08:01.670 --> 03:08:04.290]
I feel duked, but more importantly, I feel that you betrayed millions of readers.

[03:08:05.110 --> 03:08:08.330]
You have to journalists to interview Bush are willing to question him in similar terms.

[03:08:08.830 --> 03:08:12.410]
The President didn't merely betray millions of readers, he betrayed hundreds of millions of citizens.

[03:08:13.350 --> 03:08:16.870]
Bush lied about basic civil liberties in the US, instead of relying on euphemisms,

[03:08:17.230 --> 03:08:20.290]
the news media should directly confront him with a question, why would you lie?

[03:08:21.410 --> 03:08:24.290]
During the Oprah show, while lecturing a powerful book publishing executive

[03:08:24.290 --> 03:08:27.530]
who had served as an enabler for the office of Mendacity, Winfrey declared,

[03:08:27.530 --> 03:08:33.390]
that needs to change. But what about the powerful news media executives who keep enabling the President's Mendacity?

[03:08:34.210 --> 03:08:38.870]
When Fry tried to weasel out of responsibility for concocting a phony story about a root canal without anesthetic,

[03:08:39.230 --> 03:08:42.010]
the host interrupted it to the words, I've struggled with the idea of it.

[03:08:42.210 --> 03:08:46.050]
No, the lie of it, Winfrey said, that's a lie. It's not an idea, James. That's a lie.

[03:08:46.970 --> 03:08:50.490]
But high profile journalists are unwilling to confront President Bush on national television,

[03:08:50.490 --> 03:08:54.690]
what sets clarity. That's a lie. It's not an idea, George. That's a lie.

[03:08:56.330 --> 03:08:59.250]
George, I got it. How do you like that? I don't.

[03:08:59.510 --> 03:09:04.490]
Little on the murky side, 35 here right now. Even February started out on a mile stage,

[03:09:04.490 --> 03:09:08.690]
for all the people in here, the Toronto weather, and look at that sunny and 42 tomorrow.

[03:09:09.410 --> 03:09:11.530]
How do you like that? Nothing is as exact as global warming.

[03:09:11.850 --> 03:09:15.550]
And I'm not complaining, man, because I'm going to be 60 and I'm going to be pushing up

[03:09:15.550 --> 03:09:18.950]
dampen bills and pansies long before this whole thing's underwater.

[03:09:20.390 --> 03:09:25.290]
Before God gets P.O. again and hits us with another one in big floods in your pants.

[03:09:25.550 --> 03:09:28.030]
Hey, said he wouldn't do that anymore. No, he changes mine.

[03:09:28.770 --> 03:09:33.230]
He's pissed off. You heard Ray Nogganhead said that in Nolines.

[03:09:33.610 --> 03:09:38.690]
Oh, that's right. God is surely mad. Right? Maybe it'll be a chocolate flood next time.

[03:09:39.150 --> 03:09:43.790]
Exactly. I would be good. What a way to go, huh? Sure. Maybe some of that dark raspberry chocolate.

[03:09:43.990 --> 03:09:46.790]
Oh, no, right. Thank you. Some of that fun, dude. So how'd you make out?

[03:09:46.790 --> 03:09:50.470]
You blood sugar about 600 million. Yes, God. I was my head was swimming as far as the way home.

[03:09:50.470 --> 03:09:54.470]
Even Josh, even a punk like Josh, he was a swooning from all that sugar.

[03:09:54.670 --> 03:09:58.030]
Yeah, I was hurting. Well, but it was a hell of a way to go though. Why not?

[03:09:58.230 --> 03:10:01.090]
Yeah, well, good stuff. Just dip that good stuff in there and a chocolate.

[03:10:01.310 --> 03:10:07.830]
In fact, well, anyway, 5.6.7.05.60 is a matter of fact, I don't know about they still make them.

[03:10:07.830 --> 03:10:11.830]
I'm sure they must. When I was a kid, they made candy cigarettes.

[03:10:11.830 --> 03:10:17.970]
Chocolate cigarettes? Okay. Then they still like those? I haven't seen chocolate cigarettes, but they make candy cigarettes.

[03:10:18.450 --> 03:10:23.170]
I don't think they do anymore, actually. You don't know what I'm talking. You never see them. No, you can find them. You can get them out.

[03:10:23.170 --> 03:10:28.610]
Yeah. Chocolate cigarettes overseas. So you could dip your faggot right right in that fondue, man.

[03:10:29.010 --> 03:10:34.570]
Hmm. I would be smoking. WQA. M. Hello.

[03:10:34.990 --> 03:10:38.450]
Hey, stop. What's your point? Okay, good. WQA. M. Hello.

[03:10:40.230 --> 03:10:45.210]
Colonial? Yes, sir. How about your faggot too, Fiatol? What? How about that?

[03:10:45.610 --> 03:10:49.490]
Oh, this one. Oh, this poll, yeah. How about that? Joan and Melissa?

[03:10:50.370 --> 03:10:55.050]
Joan and Melissa Rivers. Okay. 9.97. We got 1,000 coming in any second. I'm maybe a while. You're on the air.

[03:10:55.390 --> 03:10:58.490]
Can I ask you another question? Go ahead.

[03:10:59.110 --> 03:11:04.570]
Being that it's died in Madelow over a quest day, you want to have a bid. I don't know if you can still play it.

[03:11:04.570 --> 03:11:13.350]
But it was the tune of Mandy, which was about grandma's panties. If you remember that, grandma's panties. Mandy, you're on that man.

[03:11:14.710 --> 03:11:22.730]
Where, you know, God married a beautiful girl. She got well, uh, gained her on a weight. Now she's like, but not wearing sexy underwear anymore.

[03:11:23.170 --> 03:11:30.810]
I'll be damned. Remember that charge? You're very well with you. I did grandma panties. It was called it. Grandma panties. We got that going. No, we're doing. What? No, I don't know where it is.

[03:11:30.810 --> 03:11:35.330]
There's grandma gap. Maybe that's where grandma got her panties at the gas.

[03:11:35.430 --> 03:11:40.410]
New from the gas. Gap for kids and baby gap. It's the new and exciting grandma gap.

[03:11:40.570 --> 03:11:48.210]
I was I bought it. Grandma Gap spent right over my tubers. I found a pair of trousers that fit right over my depends.

[03:11:48.730 --> 03:11:55.590]
Even after wearing them for the whole weekend. What's my arthritis? I couldn't get out of this dress for over a month.

[03:11:55.590 --> 03:12:01.690]
But I didn't want to. It's so pretty. I was trapped in the dressing room for a week.

[03:12:01.850 --> 03:12:11.450]
Could you help me get out of this straight jacket? I've got rubbers of grandma gap. I was falling at a moment near you. And I can't get out.

[03:12:12.470 --> 03:12:19.170]
149. So that was kind of cute. I mean, nothing new with grandma's panties and but nevertheless. No, it was a song. I don't know where it went.

[03:12:20.510 --> 03:12:26.750]
Where it came from. What I'm asking is who wrote who writes that song? Bruce Johnson. Yeah, the Beach Boys.

[03:12:29.430 --> 03:12:33.150]
Thousand something thousand and four. How do you like that? We don't need no more.

[03:12:34.650 --> 03:12:39.510]
In fact, we got no more today and we got that. I don't know what we got. And it's just today. I'm just not the mood to talk about it.

[03:12:39.510 --> 03:12:46.030]
You know, I'm feeling surly and I feel like like I'm straight in the middle of an island, the middle of a Pacific.

[03:12:46.250 --> 03:12:52.110]
And the middle of the island. It's a nice island. It's well appointed. Yeah, we got a lot of people on the island.

[03:12:52.350 --> 03:13:01.890]
We got a lot of least news on this island. So all of this sports back and forth and people sling and crap at each other and trying to make a big deal out of how that stuff.

[03:13:01.890 --> 03:13:11.690]
How would it have a good time? Okay. All you guys are on your own. On your own. My ancient back, my old faculty back is getting real tired of carrying that whole universe.

[03:13:12.010 --> 03:13:22.430]
It's like, remember in Christmas Carol and Scrooge was carrying a tiny tin on his shoulders there at the end. Yeah. Remember that? Well, my old faculty shoulders are just there. They're wearing down.

[03:13:22.430 --> 03:13:32.570]
You know, I'm going to have to start getting like some don't Crawford shoulder pads just so I can hold up my own end. What is that?

[03:13:32.930 --> 03:13:41.210]
It's Eric Carmen. What is that? All by myself. Oh, I see. I mean, I was there.

[03:13:43.370 --> 03:13:52.290]
Eric Carmen was what? Oh, now why did you send me this? Cause I never I never actually said it. I don't really care what we did. I don't know why you sent me that. Thanks.

[03:13:52.430 --> 03:14:05.910]
No, no, no, interest. Let's see. Seems to be a fact. It says I have a shameless request. Could you play the Ray Nagan chocolate song? What the hell is that? The willy wonka. It's.

[03:14:05.910 --> 03:14:15.970]
I know what it is. Why do you say that? Why are you telling me? I'm just I'm just stalling. Oh, I see. I'm just stalkers. It's not called it. It's called Ray Nagan Slasher a candy man.

[03:14:16.030 --> 03:14:31.010]
It sounds like the Lord. Every time he sees the way God wants to speak wants to take the city and cover it to sleep. Ray Nagan can. Ray Nagan can. Ray Nagan can.

[03:14:32.930 --> 03:14:46.850]
Ray Nagan can. Cause he wants to make you or at least he's cool. And I don't care what people are saying. It sounds like Jesse Jackson. We as black people. It's coming from the sun. Surely God is mad.

[03:14:46.850 --> 03:15:02.290]
He compares the local villa. We're leaving on the bottom. Chocolate. Ray Nagan can. Yes, Ray Nagan can. Ray Nagan can. Cause he wants to make you or at least he's cool.

[03:15:03.970 --> 03:15:21.790]
It's time for us to rebuild a New Orleans. The one that should be uptown or wherever they are. This city will be chocolate. A chocolate in the wall. He never takes the blame.

[03:15:25.050 --> 03:15:35.630]
It's a chocolate at the end of the day. That chocolate in some coffee and a little off one called as Ray Nagan can. Ray Nagan can.

[03:15:35.630 --> 03:15:47.130]
No, I can. Ray Nagan can. Cause he wants to make you or at least he's cool. You can't have New Orleans. No other way. It was the same.

[03:15:47.130 --> 03:16:17.110]
It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It was the same. It

[03:16:30.710 --> 03:16:45.290]
I cousicienie de laWork Red Light to my glass. Water Thetor continues to enter Whiteless Line in Whiteless line. Watergate goes only 2. Pomobrois winning.

[03:16:45.290 --> 03:16:48.210]
to your talk tonight in effective liberals.

[03:16:48.830 --> 03:16:49.070]
Yeah.

[03:16:49.490 --> 03:16:52.930]
How come nobody points out that Sandra Dayo Conner

[03:16:53.450 --> 03:16:55.490]
idiot decides to wait until Bush's president

[03:16:55.490 --> 03:16:57.270]
to resign or to retire?

[03:16:57.830 --> 03:16:59.490]
I couldn't even done that when Clinton was president.

[03:16:59.850 --> 03:17:00.530]
Yeah, bitch.

[03:17:01.190 --> 03:17:03.350]
You know, it's the big standing of Asian she got there

[03:17:03.350 --> 03:17:03.830]
last night.

[03:17:03.870 --> 03:17:05.810]
Man, why they're all opening up the hell big deal.

[03:17:06.330 --> 03:17:06.870]
They're all idiots.

[03:17:07.330 --> 03:17:08.410]
You got a good point, Pallee.

[03:17:08.430 --> 03:17:08.630]
Thanks.

[03:17:08.730 --> 03:17:10.450]
Yeah, how come my Sandra Gayo Conner,

[03:17:10.910 --> 03:17:12.030]
he's got a nice one point.

[03:17:12.150 --> 03:17:13.630]
Of course, he's been in there for a long time now.

[03:17:15.030 --> 03:17:17.590]
Yeah, seems like only yesterday that he stole the first

[03:17:17.590 --> 03:17:17.930]
election.

[03:17:18.110 --> 03:17:20.250]
Now here he's still another one since her help was failing.

[03:17:20.390 --> 03:17:22.490]
That was the story exactly for Christ.

[03:17:22.610 --> 03:17:23.550]
She's 100 years old.

[03:17:23.550 --> 03:17:25.850]
Don't be picking on that poor at least thank God for what

[03:17:25.850 --> 03:17:28.030]
she did while she was in there, which they weren't expecting.

[03:17:28.150 --> 03:17:28.510]
Right.

[03:17:29.330 --> 03:17:31.850]
They were expecting to be a good new step in Nazi and every

[03:17:31.850 --> 03:17:33.370]
time like something mighty important came up.

[03:17:33.530 --> 03:17:34.590]
She was swinging it, baby.

[03:17:35.010 --> 03:17:36.130]
She was a swing vote.

[03:17:37.470 --> 03:17:40.090]
And you got to respect an old bag like that who swings it

[03:17:40.090 --> 03:17:40.690]
every now and then.

[03:17:42.110 --> 03:17:43.510]
She was swinging it.

[03:17:44.370 --> 03:17:47.370]
5.6705.505.60 and they've arrived in singular.

[03:17:47.690 --> 03:17:48.370]
Why was mine?

[03:17:49.970 --> 03:17:52.210]
Feel like this has been going on a lot lately.

[03:17:52.410 --> 03:17:53.770]
They feel like I've had another one of those cleansing

[03:17:53.770 --> 03:17:54.770]
experiences, you know?

[03:17:55.470 --> 03:17:55.770]
Really?

[03:17:56.250 --> 03:17:57.610]
Yeah, I'm going to do it.

[03:17:58.130 --> 03:18:00.170]
Because you know, when I came in here this morning,

[03:18:00.450 --> 03:18:01.790]
I stood down and first started conversing.

[03:18:01.890 --> 03:18:04.030]
I was, I was not what you call a really happy camper.

[03:18:04.770 --> 03:18:05.390]
No, no.

[03:18:05.390 --> 03:18:07.290]
I was the sour, with skyrocketing again.

[03:18:07.290 --> 03:18:10.970]
And I was sour and hostile and PO that had been like left

[03:18:10.970 --> 03:18:11.590]
out in the lurch.

[03:18:11.830 --> 03:18:12.990]
I felt like lurch.

[03:18:14.410 --> 03:18:15.650]
Oh, no, I have to get that up.

[03:18:16.230 --> 03:18:17.410]
Yeah, get lurched.

[03:18:17.410 --> 03:18:18.690]
Not any moisture sound with it.

[03:18:19.390 --> 03:18:21.890]
But like I said, they got their thing and we got our thing

[03:18:21.890 --> 03:18:23.570]
and every the queen shall meet.

[03:18:24.150 --> 03:18:27.750]
This is Neil Rogers, retro Miami town.

[03:18:28.750 --> 03:18:34.030]
And 5 to 4 WQK and you fell.

[03:18:41.330 --> 03:18:47.090]
Every nation's trying to keep our hands on building

[03:18:47.090 --> 03:18:48.810]
nothing else.

[03:18:49.630 --> 03:18:52.530]
But they are remembering our clothes.

[03:18:54.330 --> 03:18:57.410]
But George E. Washington, the rice.

[03:18:58.170 --> 03:19:01.790]
They walk a farm down to size and grow.

[03:19:02.750 --> 03:19:05.790]
I take the land off the road.

[03:19:06.870 --> 03:19:08.710]
It's by land.

[03:19:09.490 --> 03:19:12.010]
I run as number days.

[03:19:13.310 --> 03:19:19.190]
I come back when it's well wonder when it is.

[03:19:19.190 --> 03:19:20.990]
If boys get to play.

[03:19:23.790 --> 03:19:25.070]
Bye bye bye.

[03:19:25.490 --> 03:19:28.410]
You know what I'm trying to see something to do.

[03:19:28.590 --> 03:19:29.870]
I know I can't afford lurch to.

[03:19:30.190 --> 03:19:31.170]
Ha ha ha ha ha!

[03:19:32.790 --> 03:19:33.310]
Wow!
