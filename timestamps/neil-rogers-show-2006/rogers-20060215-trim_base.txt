[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.260]
I'm going to be cold here.

[00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:02.120]
Here's the go.

[00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.860]
I'm going to repeat it.

[00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.600]
I said it on the ear and I'll say it again.

[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.060]
The sales department runs WDQAM then followed by the engineering department and programming

[00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.060]
way down in the bottom.

[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.080]
We're the bottom feeders.

[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.400]
Although it looks like you and I have been feeding pretty good, but nevertheless, I

[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.300]
got to tell you a Wayne Gretzky story before I forget.

[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:17.660]
OK.

[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.500]
So I'm sure you don't know who Bill Water is.

[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.840]
He's the former General Manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs and you know most people don't

[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.320]
care about that, but the Gretzky thing.

[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.020]
So they have a show called Leafs TV for two hours of it.

[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.420]
They're the Samo Cast on the fan radio and also on the, uh, or Mojo radio and on the

[00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.840]
Leafs TV.

[00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.020]
So anyway, yesterday I caught a little bit of it.

[00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.080]
He's telling the story about a personal friend of his and Bill Water's knows everybody

[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.560]
in hockey who was having dinner with Wayne and his wife one night some months ago.

[00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.960]
And after dinner, they went to Wayne's house and they turned on and were watching a college

[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:48.960]
basketball game.

[00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.360]
And I guess it turned out to be real off-sighted when and one side and Wayne says to his wife,

[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.600]
he says, see how he told you.

[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.320]
We should have had a hundred on this game and he wasn't talking about a hundred dollars.

[00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.560]
I don't believe that.

[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.840]
I got news for Bill Water's is a big Wayne Gretzky suck up.

[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.280]
He would never make up a story like a hundred thousand dollars on basketball game.

[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.580]
This, keep in mind, she bet five grand on the coin toss at the Super Bowl.

[00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.060]
I know, but the Super Bowl everybody over does.

[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.280]
But a basketball college basketball tent game.

[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.580]
You couldn't, you couldn't, you couldn't, you couldn't, you couldn't, you couldn't

[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.320]
If you had the right connections, you couldn't.

[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.260]
No, you couldn't.

[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.540]
Okay.

[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.820]
Hey, hey, how's those connections?

[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.580]
What are you talking about?

[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.480]
That's correct.

[00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.220]
You can't.

[00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.040]
He's connections.

[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.760]
No, but there's no place you could bet a hundred thousand on a basketball.

[00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.160]
Okay.

[00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.220]
So, that story.

[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.440]
And just, what is most amated up and in the meantime, he's doing everything he can to

[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.480]
side with Wayne.

[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.960]
That's why with somebody, why would somebody make up something like that?

[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.720]
That would be pretty slanderous if it weren't true.

[00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.180]
Yeah, people in Ballystuff.

[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.700]
Okay.

[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.320]
So, maybe it was a 10.

[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.740]
Maybe it was 10.

[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.520]
Mm-hmm.

[00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.940]
I would believe 10.

[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.000]
And anyway, it's still a betting on sports, okay, which is he lies to a teeth.

[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.240]
This thing's going to blow up in his face, something like brutal.

[00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.360]
And maybe that's not really all.

[00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.160]
Certainly has been a distraction.

[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.620]
Well, who cares about the only one seven to two today?

[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.000]
Yeah, who cares?

[00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.820]
Boring.

[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.100]
But all these people are looking at all these.

[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.560]
I wouldn't watch it.

[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.440]
I wouldn't pay any attention.

[00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.300]
Like I said yesterday, the National Hockey League is the only professional sports league

[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.400]
that allows its athletes to participate.

[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.180]
What is supposed to be amateur sports and risk their health and again, some

[00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.080]
their nose into fans and shut the league down for two weeks after missing a whole season.

[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.060]
And then basically say, well, if your favorite player's good engine, we missed the

[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.460]
playoffs, so we have a lousy season to think in fact, because we're more concerned about

[00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.240]
Canada's ego.

[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.760]
That's what the whole thing is all about is about Canada's ego.

[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.020]
Yeah, Nicole yesterday from somebody wanting to know why they don't play basketball in

[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.120]
the winter during the basketball season like hockey does because basketball won't break

[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.320]
up its season to do that.

[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.720]
Right.

[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.180]
Well, in addition to which, can you see the end?

[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.920]
Can you see?

[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.060]
I just can see that.

[00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.760]
I can see the NBA going over there and playing in the winter Olympics.

[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.680]
Well, they playing the summer Olympics.

[00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:03.200]
Yeah.

[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.800]
And is that right?

[00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.400]
They make a fortune.

[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:07.540]
Well, that's sad.

[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.160]
You know what?

[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.580]
Whether it's right or not, the NBA, it's a cash cow for the NBA because of the merchandise

[00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.500]
they sell from their Olympic team.

[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.940]
Well, to me, to me, it's a snub to the fans.

[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.820]
You don't see baseball doing it.

[00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:22.880]
You don't see football doing it.

[00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.200]
What's baseball going down, Neil?

[00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.500]
Baseball's got this with these world games they're playing.

[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:28.160]
Yeah.

[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.100]
What's the point of that?

[00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.000]
And they're going to play in the middle of spring training.

[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.040]
What happens if one of, if a pitcher throws his arm out and ran this game?

[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.300]
It's just not wrong.

[00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.780]
It's just, it's stupid, but I think it's totally stupid.

[00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.420]
Well, the fans can be it to them with the fans as the message.

[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.380]
That's what it's all about.

[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.380]
They expect people to go and pay through the nose to see mediocre garbage and watered

[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.080]
down crap and then they found their nose at him.

[00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.840]
And they can't understand what they got.

[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.960]
They got these thousands of people disguised as empty seats.

[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.300]
So my little Hamilton has a book.

[00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.000]
Don't get talked up about it.

[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.120]
No, my little Zary.

[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.540]
And he writes about Harry Carey in the book.

[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.120]
They hear each other.

[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.940]
He treated everyone the same way and sure he was a miserable human being.

[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.360]
They hated each other those too.

[00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.460]
Well, there are a lot of people that said that that Harry was especially when he was

[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.620]
drinking which is most of the time miserable drunk.

[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:20.740]
But so who cares?

[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.600]
See, do we really have to know that?

[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.240]
Yeah.

[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.440]
I'm not going to put Mo in my book.

[00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.260]
Mo.

[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.700]
You're comparing Mo with Harry Carey?

[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:37.340]
Is that what you're saying?

[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.060]
No, just I said I'm going to marry him.

[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.940]
Yeah, well I had Harry on the show one time.

[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.640]
I remember that.

[00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.820]
He's bleachers in Chicago.

[00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.100]
He was very nice to me.

[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.980]
I heard that.

[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.120]
He was very impressed that I remember him doing St. Louis, you Billiken's basketball and

[00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:52.940]
big Harry Carey fan.

[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.420]
He was great.

[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.520]
He made me a rockups fan.

[00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.820]
I don't care if he was the biggest bastard on the face.

[00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.140]
He says, what do I care about that?

[00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:59.360]
Not my business.

[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.260]
I don't care if he used to beat up his wife and his dog and whatever else that's his

[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.580]
business.

[00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.900]
He was a great broadcaster.

[00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:07.820]
He was one of a kind.

[00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.520]
He was like the Howard Co-Sell of baseball.

[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.860]
He was tremendous.

[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.660]
Yes, he was.

[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.600]
And we got to find out from a Marsy.

[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.760]
I don't know why I said that.

[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.860]
I liked the Milo Hamilton just because he did it interview with me one time when I was

[00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:22.960]
in West Palm on J&O.

[00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.220]
Well, Milo had a good drug.

[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.900]
No, Milo's with.

[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:29.520]
Milo's with.

[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.660]
Milo's is giving me another beer.

[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.100]
Yeah.

[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.700]
Making waves 60 years at Milo's microphone.

[00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:39.400]
That's the book.

[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.580]
I like Milo.

[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.620]
He's a good broadcaster.

[00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.560]
But he couldn't like Harry's butt.

[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.320]
I would buy a book by Milo Hamilton.

[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.260]
Somebody just put a lot of time on their hands.

[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.500]
Somebody else to read it to them.

[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.960]
He was not a national guy.

[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.000]
Of course not.

[00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.800]
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.300]
You ask anybody who's even a marginal baseball fan who Harry Kiri was and I can tell you

[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.040]
immediately and I'll probably tell you stories.

[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.080]
But ask him, hey, how about Milo Hamilton?

[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.720]
And I'll say, is that the guy that had the duel with Ella was Raymond Burr?

[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.760]
He gave him the last vice president to give him somebody.

[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:14.120]
Yeah, right.

[00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.600]
He had a duel with Raymond Burr because Raymond was gay.

[00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:18.560]
That's another story.

[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:19.940]
Don't you get most dirty on that?

[00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:19.960]
I don't know.

[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.340]
I like that other shit.

[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.480]
I like your version.

[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.560]
That's my version of what?

[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:32.980]
Of the Milo Hamilton-Ramford duel.

[00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:38.740]
Anyway, we got some real stuff going on inside this radio station.

[00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:39.320]
I'll tell you that.

[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.000]
I'll tell you something.

[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.660]
The East is out sick today.

[00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.680]
It was 65 in a studio yesterday.

[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:51.260]
And the engineers say that they can't fix this for some reason.

[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.360]
But they can't fix anything.

[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.000]
So what's about that?

[00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.640]
Don't forget, they're right after the sales department running the show.

[00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.840]
I just told Clarence a little while ago.

[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.220]
It told me some amazing stories, by the way, about some of the stuff that was going on under

[00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.120]
Greg Reed's leadership.

[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.860]
But I mean, it would make the hearstand on your head and you know, have any.

[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:12.200]
But the face has changed, but the situation is still the same.

[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:13.940]
You want me to buy that?

[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.740]
Yes, nice to see Brian Smith's back today.

[00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:16.480]
A real sales guy.

[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:17.340]
Welcome back, Brian.

[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:18.900]
He came in for a couple of minutes.

[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.940]
He's a real good guy and a good salesman, a real salesperson, which is nice to have won.

[00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.160]
He ain't no Todd Dreck.

[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.660]
That's your assignment, by the way, between now and Friday is to kill Todd Dreck.

[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.920]
I'd be happy to.

[00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:33.780]
Wayne and Wrenskian is wife.

[00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:34.780]
I'll give you a hundred for it.

[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.500]
I'll take him out.

[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.100]
We'll go quail hunting together.

[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:37.740]
There you go.

[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:38.980]
Take him out with a VPs.

[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.940]
Which by the way, if this guy croaks, he's going to be a, um, yeah.

[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.000]
No, seriously.

[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:46.560]
That's funny.

[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.860]
You have any guy had a heart attack?

[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:48.920]
Right.

[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.220]
Well, how would you feel if somebody shot you in a face with a pellet gun?

[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.380]
Well, in my case, probably would notice the difference.

[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.200]
And this old guy too, it's not so much the face that's the problem.

[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:01.800]
It's the heart.

[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:02.400]
Yep.

[00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:04.580]
The heart.

[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:05.780]
The guy has a heart attack.

[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.760]
And they also scum, we're telling a light about that for 12 hours.

[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.780]
I don't know how many hours, but they've been lying to their teeth and withholding information.

[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.520]
He knew about it.

[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.660]
He was whispered to him before he even started his press conference yesterday.

[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.500]
And he held that back.

[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.940]
And Cheney hasn't said anything yet.

[00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:23.540]

[00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:26.160]
No, and the Republicans are all whipped up into a frenzy about that.

[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.560]
He's not saying anything as he doesn't want to recriminate himself,

[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.080]
because if the guy does croak, he's going to wind up getting a...

[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:31.780]
Wait, what a lawsuit.

[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:32.600]
That'll be...

[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.400]
Not just lawsuit.

[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.560]
There could be criminal charges.

[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:36.800]
Man slaughter.

[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:38.800]
A trial.

[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:39.500]
Can you imagine that?

[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:40.740]
A trial for device president?

[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.760]
And I still say the public's all whipped up about this in immediate two,

[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.740]
and all these innocent people dying air every single day.

[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.860]
Three more school kids got killed and bagged that in six police today,

[00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:51.960]
but nobody cares about that.

[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.860]
It's not to mention the 2250 American soldiers.

[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.840]
If all these geniuses on there, like Jay Leno,

[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.440]
and even John Stewart, and I'll end the letterman,

[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:08.760]
if they spent as much time screaming about the slaughtered innocent people over there,

[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.940]
is they are about this bird shoot thing.

[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.220]
Well, there's no humor in it.

[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:12.820]
Yeah, I see.

[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.660]
But there shouldn't be any humor in that either.

[00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.900]
You don't believe that story about waiting 100 minutes?

[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.160]
I don't think it was 100 minutes.

[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.240]
No, that's what he said.

[00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.120]
I don't even know what he was doing.

[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.020]
Where does he guys?

[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:31.500]
Where is he going to find somebody to take a $100,000 bet on a basket?

[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.140]
Rick Tuckett.

[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.340]
No, they wouldn't.

[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.580]
How do you know that?

[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.120]
I know.

[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.900]
I know a lot of people in that business.

[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:40.560]
Do you?

[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:40.960]
Yes.

[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:46.840]
For example, I talked to a couple of guys in Las Vegas during their week about

[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:52.620]
what they would do if somebody came in and bet $75,000 on a Super Bowl game.

[00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:52.880]
Right.

[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.400]
And they would take it.

[00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:58.440]
They would raise their eyebrows a little bit,

[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.620]
but the question was, you know, people are now raising a point.

[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.260]
Well, it leads to fixes and whatnot.

[00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:10.620]
Well, if you wanted a bet more than that, you would have a lot of trouble laying it off.

[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.620]
But there are some customers, for example, Carl Icon,

[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.280]
could bet a million dollars on a game, on a Super Bowl game.

[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:18.700]
He will.

[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:23.760]
But nobody's ever going to bet that kind of money on a basketball game someplace they

[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:24.580]
would never take the bet.

[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.800]
No good bookmaker would ever put himself up.

[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.100]
Bill Waters, I'm going to tell him he's a liar.

[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.520]
You're going to tell him Hank said you're a liar.

[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.340]
He's full of it.

[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.740]
You can tell him I don't think so.

[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.740]
I'll bet you 100,000.

[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:41.780]
I'll tell you what, I bet you 500, I like that.

[00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:42.620]
Okay, you're on.

[00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:43.360]
There you go.

[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:44.940]
I bet you 20 million.

[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.940]
You know, the people, 20 numbers around, but you know, the people,

[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.040]
45 million of the beeslees money, okay?

[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.960]
One thing about bookies, they are not looking to lose money.

[00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:59.120]
If somebody, you know, my uncle was a bookie, okay, Mugsy Solomon.

[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.580]
Soon I have to tell me about bookies.

[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.240]
I'm sure he was a 100,000 dollar bet.

[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:04.500]
I don't know.

[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.620]
I'm not back in those days.

[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.940]
I think Mugsy ever saw 100 grand in his life.

[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:13.880]
But he married a real big box of shicks, I'll tell you that.

[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.480]
About the third of his age.

[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.020]
That's nothing to hold against him.

[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.060]
He had a little bees problem.

[00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.900]
No, she had plenty to hold against him.

[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:21.820]
That's why he married her.

[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:22.240]
Yeah.

[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:29.280]
Well on that note, I'm going to like, I've got a Todd Dreck voodoo doll.

[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.560]
I'm going to go into it.

[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.640]
I don't want to go into it on the air.

[00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.940]
It would be just a very bad form, even for me.

[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:37.920]
He's the antichrist.

[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.300]
He's just impossible.

[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:41.980]
See, everything we do has to be for his benefit.

[00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:47.040]
No matter how much we have to sell out, no matter how much, it always has to be for him.

[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:51.880]
I had an issue with another person yesterday who sold somebody a live spot in my show.

[00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:55.740]
One live and one tape inside the show.

[00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.080]
It doesn't work that way.

[00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:58.560]
Right.

[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.540]
Well they just make it up as they go along.

[00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:01.760]
Yeah.

[00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:03.880]
They try to switch stuff by it.

[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.940]
And then there's stuff that shows up on the log that nobody ever heard of before.

[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:07.900]
Like, well, what's this?

[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:08.460]
Yeah.

[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.320]
Oh, look, let's not put the audience into a coma with all this stuff.

[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.780]
Because like I said, the face has changed but nothing else changes.

[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:15.420]
Copy?

[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:16.100]
What's that?

[00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:18.140]
We can't even get them to put on a copy.

[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.740]
Who the hell are the salesperson?

[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:21.720]
Is that so-and-a-count?

[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:22.820]
You're pretty good at it.

[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.520]
I can't get any more.

[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:30.380]
I can't get any more.

[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:30.420]
I can't get any more.

[00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:30.420]

[00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:30.860]
I can't get any more.

[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:30.880]
I can't get any more.

[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:32.360]
I can't get any more.

[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.220]
I can't get any more.

[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:35.720]
I can't get any more.

[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:36.540]
I can't get any more.

[00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:36.540]

[00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:36.540]

[00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:36.540]

[00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:36.540]

[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.160]
I can't get any more.

[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:38.120]
I can't get any more.

[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.940]
I can't get any more.

[00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:40.260]
I can't get any more.

[00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:41.620]
I can't get any more.

[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:41.700]
I can't get any more.

[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:43.040]
I can't get any more.

[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.560]
I can't get any more.

[00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:45.600]
I can't get any more.

[00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:52.540]
I can't get any more.

[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.000]
I can't get any more.

[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:03.000]

[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:03.000]

[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:03.000]

[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:03.000]

[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:03.000]

[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.220]
I can't get any more.

[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.220]
I can't get any more.

[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:05.660]
I can't get any more.

[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:05.700]
I can't get any more.

[00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:06.180]
I can't get any more.

[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:06.180]

[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:06.200]
I can't get any more.

[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:11.680]
I can't get any more.

[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.680]
I can't get any more.

[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:16.740]
I can't get any more.

[00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:16.960]
I can't get any more.

[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:17.520]
I can't get any more.

[00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.660]
I can't get any more.

[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.340]
I can't get any more.

[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:21.600]
I can't get any more.

[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.520]
I can't get any more.

[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:22.520]

[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:22.520]

[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:25.520]
Absolutely!

[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:29.900]

[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:31.960]
Absolutely!

[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.180]
You'll be dropping.

[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:35.920]
You'll be dropping.

[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.920]
There is no such thing as privacy.

[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:39.500]

[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.720]
You'll be dropping.

[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.180]
You'll be dropping.

[00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:46.800]
We'll come to see

[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.520]
We'll come to see

[00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:20.500]
I'm a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a

[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:57.360]
God! The priest looked at him and said, that's right. Then he asked who is God, son. Once

[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:03.980]
more, Buffy poked her husband, Bill, with her needle. He screamed Jesus again, the priest

[00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:09.340]
said correct. Finally the priest asked, what did he say to Adam when she didn't want

[00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:14.500]
any more children? Well, Buffy poked her husband, Bill again, but this time he screamed,

[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:18.460]
poked me with that thing one more time and I'm going to rip it off. The priest said, that's

[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:26.120]
right. Paul Harley. Good day. 1018 at 560. He's getting better at that Paul Harley later,

[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:31.340]
you know what? So far, he's become mildly amusing. This is mildly amusing before I get into

[00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:35.980]
any heavy duty stuff. Although I guess we got to do the bad news in Iraq first. What, why

[00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.980]
don't you ever read any of that good news? All made bomb killed three boys on a way to

[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:42.600]
school that they impact at least eight other people including six policemen died in

[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:46.660]
car bombings and shootings across the Iraqi capital. It's a hell on earth is what it is

[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:51.460]
we created over there. Freedom's on the march. The bombing occurred in Central Baghdad's

[00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:56.120]
bustling Fidel area. That's Fidel, not Fidel. Destroying a camera shot that's old black

[00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:00.400]
market alcohol and damaging several other stories. The children at 12 year old and 214

[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.860]
year olds had just left their houses for a school when they were hit by the blood

[00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:07.600]
there they did. There they did and the six police people dying every day innocent people.

[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:13.360]
But worry about that. They shoot them up there in Texas and so as a result the raw story

[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:18.900]
just reports this an article at MSNBC's website was edited to remove references to alcohol

[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:23.180]
that may have been available at a picnic which preceded the accidental shooting of that 78

[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:27.760]
year lawyer by Dick Cheney. Uh huh. That makes sense by the way. The change of the article

[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.980]
was quickly noticed by a number of liberal bloggers and there were many of whom have been

[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:34.980]
following this much discussed story very closely last few days and if they only would

[00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:39.060]
be following the death in Iraq more closely we'd be a lot happier about that. In the article

[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:44.100]
credited to Arem Rossden and the NBC investigative unit Catherine Armstrong, member of the family

[00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.880]
who owns the ranch, revealed new details about her lobbying for the Bush administration

[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:51.580]
and about circumstances surrounding the incident itself which wasn't reported to media

[00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:55.360]
till the following morning. Armstrong was the one who reported the news to a local news

[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.940]
reporter and said she said that Cheney agreed with the decision. The following paragraph

[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:03.280]
was removed for unexplained reasons from the article sometime after was first published

[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:08.980]
on the internet. Armstrong also told NBC News that she does not believe alcohol was involved

[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:13.220]
in the accident. She says she believes no one that they was drinking. Although she says there

[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:17.260]
may have been beer available during a picnic once that preceded the incident there may have

[00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:22.200]
been a beer to win there. She said but remember not everyone in the party was shooting or at least

[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:28.260]
not everybody was shooting straight. Jane Hanshire, the popular fire dog lake blog included the beer

[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:32.180]
quote in a posh hero while we're still on the web live. Then later noted an update the article

[00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:36.820]
appeared to have been scrubbed or removed from the MSNBC website. Hanshire also linked to an

[00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:41.520]
earlier posh hero in which a similar scrubbing occurred but at that time at the CBS News website.

[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:45.540]
Other blogs and websites that spotted the change include Democratic Underground,

[00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:49.860]
thought crimes in the daily costs. Johnny Cougar who left a comment Democratic Underground

[00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:53.400]
appears to have been the first blogger to catch the switch and also covered it in his blog.

[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:57.920]
Since Armstrong was interviewed by telephone there may be lingering questions as to why MSNBC

[00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:03.640]
scrubbed the story. See what I'm saying they scrubbed the... I'm sure a lot of you get the impression

[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:07.540]
that the vice president had a popper to and then went out there with like the poppins and all the

[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:13.220]
truth because he was like little uh you know glirriye that would be bad. The special later on after

[00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:16.520]
this guy croaks we have them criminal proceedings going on that would really be bad.

[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:21.200]
Speaking of criminal proceedings some of those things that clearance told us before the show

[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:25.640]
today boy there are people on death row for lesser crimes than he was telling us about you know I mean

[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:30.220]
what do you mean? Police bus driver tosses complaining rider into traffic.

[00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:35.200]
This is a great story I'm so glad to see you. Somebody thanks to send or something.

[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:41.400]
Somebody emailed it to me. No well thank you. Take it down. A transit bus driver grabbed a woman

[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:46.880]
by the hair this is in Philadelphia. Grabbed her by the hair not creating a pull open the door

[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:51.740]
and tossed her ass into traffic after she yelled at him from missing her stop police said. You go boy

[00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:56.940]
nice going. The 50th year old woman who was not identified suffered a broken shoulder.

[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:01.760]
Bus driver Mario Edney 53 was a rain Thursday and aggravated assault other charges.

[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.800]
Said officer Jillian Russell the police spoke somebody's being held in two thousand dollars bond.

[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:12.160]
For this story is from last week. Well I see it says Thursday February 9. What we found it anyway.

[00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:15.600]
Well for ten. Edney said he had a skip to woman's stop once the morning because of a detour.

[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:20.220]
Transit officials intend to fire Edney who has been suspended without pay following hearing.

[00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:25.400]
Well shame on them I think he did the right thing. He couldn't stop there anyway there was a detour

[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:29.280]
he wasn't going to break the law for this bitch and so he had a like turkey and so she started

[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:33.940]
bitching him out and he picked her ass up and tossed her out the window out the door whatever.

[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:40.340]
Are you like that? I like it. I like it. I like it. So that starts to wind and

[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:43.800]
complain much like Todd direct throw his ass out the window right now right now.

[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:48.820]
That's it. That's Brian Schmutz's first assignment on his way back into our sales department now

[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:52.160]
and he already knows about that. He's a big enough of a guy he could pick up Todd

[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:56.440]
direct with one finger. He has a big guy. In fact both campers coming back in there and the two of

[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:59.360]
them are going to pick up Todd and they're going to look like a body slam and he's going to be the

[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:05.400]
pivot man. They're going to do a little ass to ass. You better be fucked man. He's going to get

[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:10.640]
to the old squeeze. They're going to squeeze him like a two but two paste piece of

[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:16.220]
a direct. Also let's see don't we have to pull yourself in there or I throw that out.

[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:22.020]
I sure off I didn't do that. I throw it out. Oh no we can get it again if you want.

[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.540]
Well I got so much good stuff and then I got thrown when Hank's there to throw in a monkey wrench

[00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:31.820]
in that whole deal about the bill water story about rescue and 100 grand. He doesn't believe it.

[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:36.080]
I believe it. I mean he may have been exaggerating the number. He may have been another

[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:41.620]
in the suit. I'm saying no. When he was saying that he may have been saying it to another

[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:46.900]
words maybe he was like you don't understand what I'm saying. I don't have that pull yourself

[00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:51.160]
message. It's my more important thing. How are you going to get it? Here I got it. I have days

[00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:56.820]
well get it for me please because in the midst of all this other stuff see I got out of my usual

[00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:04.300]
routine here. So let's take a look while George is trying to make that up. What is the gayest

[00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:09.740]
thing a so-called straight guy can do? We got 859 votes. We got another good shot of the thousand

[00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:15.120]
of the day. The gayest thing a so-called straight guy can do. Kiss another guy 161. But

[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:20.000]
Europeans in the Shmata heads and just about over the world they'd be like it gets serious you know

[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.640]
while you guys are uptight. Well they are. Look at that ugly dog. Did you see that? Yeah they were

[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:30.680]
showing it all morning. Oh my god. And look at that ugly dog. I like the first one better.

[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:39.720]
Me too. At least he wasn't the right winger. He wasn't confedulating with the right

[00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:45.200]
dog. What is that? I don't know. Ugly. The Westminster winner one of the ugliest creatures I've

[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:49.280]
ever seen. You know what a dog lover I am. Yeah. Erick. By the way put a feature in there for

[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:53.940]
our convenience. Yes. All you have to do is hit view previous on your little thing there. And

[00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:58.940]
there you are. Like magic. Erick you are view the man. Man in fact that even have to print it out.

[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:02.460]
I'll just give it to you right now. That's right. Or what is the biggest type of all time? This man

[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:07.160]
is you know an unruly Josh keeps ripping him and asked. That's a bullterry of other way. Is that

[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.480]
what it is? I think I'd start to say that and then George interrupted me with his usual

[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:18.660]
I am. Interruption. Yeah. That's great. So anyway here's the pull from yesterday. The biggest

[00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:23.040]
type of all time we had 1695. Oh see if I let it go a little bit longer we could have done 1700

[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:36.960]
then we got that bonus. The bonus of Josh gets and Erick gets for the bogus. Religion 505. Nobody

[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:45.820]
has a sterne 154. American Idol 124 Super Bowl 105. Y2K 102. The Segway 90. Elvis 54. Blue

[00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:51.820]
Grapebroker. Broke. Broke. Grass Mountain. Broke your ass mountain 50. Low carb diets 39. How's

[00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:59.640]
Dr. Bob doing? Madonna 37. Tom Cruise 36. Oh we got a Tom Cruise story today. Yeah. The

[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:06.540]
Olympus 35. The Beatles 29. Dr. Phil 21. Low fat diets 19. Dean Orner. Same person as Todd

[00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:14.400]
Dreck. Kill them both. Oprah 18. Dr. 13. Michael Jackson 10. Mesh 9. David Letterman 8.

[00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:19.000]
So in other words there's no half the Letterman show when he throws that pencil through the window

[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.420]
that's uh yeah. Hey listen these are it. All you punks out there I think David Letterman's funny.

[00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:28.720]
He's a panic man. He's a laugh right. All those stupid pet tricks. I bet the dogs on his show

[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:32.800]
look better than I want to one of West Minister dogs show no doubt. You don't like anybody in the

[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:37.460]
other day. Yeah. Well there you go. I like a lot of people. I like the in fact even George

[00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:41.120]
like that show the supernatural last night. I'm actually Joshua. I was a surprisingly adequate.

[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:47.760]
I'll show how I'm doing. Oh well I'll tell you the one good news is there were no scenes in

[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:51.860]
the show last night when they were like sleeping together in the same room. No good night brother.

[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:56.200]
Maybe daddy will call. Now they are brothers even though they were pretending to be cousins in that

[00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:02.120]
episode last night. I thought they were brothers Sam and Dean. Right. Yeah. That's that's what you

[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.980]
uh you were telling me but last night like they were pretending to be cousins. Who cares if I'll

[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:09.040]
say the cop? Well then of course the whole show they're looking for daddy you know. Maybe they're

[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:14.640]
looking for a sugar daddy. Maybe you have to say my number. They're a part of your way. 27 past

You know we never even talked about that. They unfilled that big new semi-steready of 5

[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:41.720]
blades, Gillette at the Assypable.

[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:45.620]
We were talking about all the different razors that people use.

[00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:49.640]
Yeah, what will they stop? And Josh is trying to convince himself that the more blades

[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:53.220]
it's got, the better a shave you get. That's ridiculous. I don't agree with that.

[00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:57.620]
You were the one that was given the solid answer about that vibrating one.

[00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.040]
Are you a shave your raccoon with?

[00:26:59.260 --> 00:26:59.980]
That's what I use.

[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.680]
Well, okay, so a lot of guys would like to shave their raccoon with it. Maybe you can come

[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:04.840]
over and help them out. I don't know.

[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:09.620]
I have it sitting there. I will never use it again. I'll say that right now. I'm not going

[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:13.080]
to argue with you. Use whatever you like. I used to see that. That's why I am. I'm not going to

[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:16.120]
shave with something because somebody tells me that's what they like.

[00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:17.000]
Well, I can't great.

[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.940]
Well, I can't you like disposable. That's right. I like what I like and you like what you like.

[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:24.740]
And believe me, there's a big disparity there. Trust me. Anyway, I'm going to be kicked by a

[00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:27.780]
shabelet broken glass. There you go. Well, it's how you can afford it. That's right.

[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.760]
Actually, I'm going to that face transplant.

[00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:30.400]
Are you?

[00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:30.800]
Yeah.

[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:34.500]
I would do it. In fact, I understand that the water

[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.000]
Nazis thinking about checking that out.

[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:39.540]
Now, let me just say this before we... What was I just going to say? There's something

[00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:43.880]
where you're all about the five blade deal I've come in out now. They do have out. What is it called?

[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000]
I don't even know what it's called.

[00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:47.660]
The Mox5.

[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:54.860]
I mean, it's just so pathetic. I said it's like Chef Boy RD. It's a sustained marketing concept.

[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:58.920]
Gillette knows Dan Well and so does chicken all the other ones. That if you put out like,

[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:03.240]
75 different products, which are basically the same with a little bit different variation,

[00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:08.100]
you're going to sell a hell of a lot more crap. Just like Chef Boy RD. They basically take the same

[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:12.440]
moushy pasta and they have a wood meat balls and it shapes like stars and shapes like

[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:16.140]
ringadings and dingalings and all that stuff. Curly things.

[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:19.860]
Right. Similar crap, but you go to the store and there's like

[00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:25.620]
Ravioli with cheese and Ravioli with beef and Raviolios and beefaronios and it's just the same

[00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:30.120]
marketing. That's what the world is. The world is a business. That's what we're finding out

[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:33.960]
here at QA and make no mistake about it. The world is a business. It's all about MoNyY.

[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:38.280]
Just give us the F and money and everything else is secondary. It's called the Gillette Fusion 5.

[00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:41.360]
Well, thank you so much. There's a lot of confusion about it.

[00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:47.380]
Just give us the money, baby. Everybody listening to me right now. Send us a bag of money, okay?

[00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:51.720]
Well, I'll take it one thing. I could read. He sure had some stuff going on in that place.

[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:56.420]
Anyway, so the book. I got the story about that dog and you know what a dog

[00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:59.400]
ever I might say that again because I don't want to you know that's your name.

[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.780]
The Madison Square Garden crowd went wild for the Golden Retriever. Well, leave it to the

[00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:06.460]
Madison Square Garden crowd. I've good taste. The Golden Retriever is the greatest dog ever.

[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:10.580]
A born. Anybody want to argue that with me? Well, guess what? To you, okay?

[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:15.040]
I love Golden Retrievers. And the Old English Sheep Dog. Now that's not for me.

[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:19.920]
The Old English Sheep Dog. No. In fact, quite honestly, that don't even look like a dog to me.

[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:24.480]
The Sheep Dog. What's it look like? The sheep? I'm a little sheepish about. Ask those guys up

[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:28.260]
there in the woods in Verass Mountain, Eltena. They spend a lot of time up there with the sheep.

[00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:35.180]
But in the end, whoops. In the end, best in show with the Westminster Kennelbog show,

[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:41.000]
went to a breed that hasn't once since 1918, a colored bull terrier. Not just a bull terrier.

[00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:47.600]
I think it's a racial thing. A colored bull terrier. His owner is Tom and Barbara Bishop of

[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:52.340]
Homedale, New Jersey, screamed, wept in all the collect in the stands. Oh, when the tall

[00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:57.220]
dapper Canadian judge had figured silly, walked toward their dog, Rufus, varying the coveted purple

[00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:03.340]
and gold ribbon, and so for trophy, and said, how's it going, eh? This is like having Lance

[00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:08.020]
Armstrong for a son said, Tom, a 50-year-old chemical plant man and supervisor and a quarter-war jacket.

[00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:14.880]
Well, I wonder if the dog is on drugs? Rufus, whose show name is CH Rocky Top Sundance Kid,

[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:21.860]
is the couch potato at home, a quorum of Barbara. In addition to golden retrieving the old English

[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:26.380]
sheep dog, Rufus beat out a rot-wilder, a Scottish deer-hound. I don't even know I have any idea what

[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:31.860]
that is. A Dalmatian and a pug. Oh, blah, blah, what an outstanding, not too many weed,

[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.880]
a dog's eye like an egg-roop, a pug. Well, you know how the artsy parched the crowd is. The

[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:39.400]
other year the better. I see. Well, I'm surprised the Afghan horn wasn't in her again,

[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:47.780]
which ended just before 11 o'clock last night. I used to have a friend in college from Detroit,

[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:52.040]
John from Detroit. He looked just like an Afghan horn with that ugly.

[00:30:54.080 --> 00:31:02.500]
That's something. I'm just exactly like it. So anyway, the colored bull terrier wins the

[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:09.380]
that whole thing is in its accommodity show. They don't realize that everybody in the world

[00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:14.040]
and these people take it very seriously. And they got the dog and the dogs are dragging them around

[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:18.020]
on a leash, you know. The dogs are trotting and these people are like trotting after them trying to

[00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:24.120]
keep up so they'll fall under ass. Speaking of falling on their ass, new photos of Abu Gharri, I'm sorry,

[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:32.660]
new photos of Abu Gharri abuse surface images on Australian TV date from late 2003. Sydney,

[00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:37.640]
Australia. And Australian television network broadcast photographs and video clips today that

[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:41.880]
said were previously on public images of the alleged abuse of Iraqi sell the US military

[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:49.460]
customer customer of the Abu Gharri prison. The images were taken at Abu Gharri in late 2003 at

[00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:54.120]
about the same time as previously published photos of Iraqi prison abuse, the special broadcasting

[00:31:54.120 --> 00:32:01.300]
services date line program report. That's the SBS to UA in Australia. SBS refused to give details

[00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:05.160]
on the source of the photos and the authenticity of the images could not be verified independently,

[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:10.140]
as if, you know. The images shown by the SBS were consistent with earlier photos of abuse by

[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:13.820]
American soldiers, which triggered outrage in the Middle East and prompted US congressional

[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:18.120]
investigation and military trials for some soldiers involved. You'll see there ought to be a lot

[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:22.480]
more whipped up about these pictures than they are about those stupid ass cartoons. No one in the

[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:27.240]
images broadcast today could clearly be identified as US military personnel, men wearing prisoners

[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:32.300]
performing sex acts, SBS said the photographs of the dead bodies where people who had died at the prison.

[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:37.980]
Something missing, and I thought there, men wearing something. There's a percent in the

[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:42.640]
line missing. One clip broadcast by SBS showed a group of naked men with bags over their head standing

[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:47.480]
together masturbating. The network said the masturbation had been forced. Another video showed a man

[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:52.220]
repeatedly beating himself against a wall. A photograph showed a man with a deep cut on his neck,

[00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:56.540]
another of the same answer under diamond dress and khaki shorts and pants with one man 20 at the

[00:32:56.540 --> 00:33:01.620]
wound. SBS said the images among photos, the American civil liberties union was trying to obtain

[00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:05.960]
from the US government under a freedom of information request. A US military court in September

[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:09.980]
upheld the request, the ruling covering scores of photos and several videotapes. The government

[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:13.560]
lawyer said it was considering an appeal and the images were not immediately released, but you

[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:20.880]
can see them all over the place. Oh I see this is the second page and I have a matter order.

[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:27.540]
Not wearing a... Where are you going? What? Stuff. Two twos. Not wearing my lead tarts. Fanny packed.

[00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:30.660]
And of course this is the same network that showed us a couple of these pictures a little while

[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:36.400]
enough. The same network that pixelated out those Danish cartoons and then the alleged Danish

[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:40.580]
cartoons ones that were fabricated by the Schmitts derbers by the Ojjampravakadtermgoyam.

[00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:46.100]
They still pixelating it out of the excuse being well they don't want to add to the insensitivity

[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:51.020]
and then flame. Yeah right. Much as spineless cars you're afraid of much of ragheads are going to

[00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:55.000]
like he said on your studios there in Atlanta and just burn that baby in the ground which I say

[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:02.580]
alright you go for it. Schmattaheads CNN the evil doers of all time when the history of mankind

[00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:06.560]
is written forget about Hitler forget about Stalin forget about Mussolini forget about all the

[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:11.760]
the evil forget about Paul Pot forget about George's Pot CNN will go down the history as the

[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:17.700]
most evil force just like Howard Beale said remember what he said about the the biggest GD

[00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:23.260]
whatever he said so we can't even say that anymore force in the history of mankind even that

[00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:29.920]
was to 72 or whatever was 76 trombones and it was right so that's why that movie is so important

[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:33.280]
in Josh just he doesn't care he wants to be entertained he doesn't care about the significance of

[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:37.120]

[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:29.140]
they ran right out and bought very manllow out several that's correct I've been ahead today by

[00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:34.660]
the way just want to say that to the audience have been what's the word I'm looking forward

[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:39.560]
snuckered snuckered that's a good word for it I've been snuckered having given the old bait and

[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:44.260]
swished today but I'd be better boop in other words you know always agree with whatever

[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:48.520]
people say to you and then the stab in the back that's the new deal we got now agree with everything

[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:53.060]
that I say and then just go ahead and turn around stab me that's all right I can handle it I got a big fat

[00:38:53.060 --> 00:39:00.040]
back and a big fat perfect pretty sad what's going on but nevertheless it never change because

[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:04.460]
it's the easily effing way make no mistake about that when you're working for people who you know

[00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:09.080]
live in a tree yeah I remember little kids used to have a tree house you know but adults

[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:14.540]
part that it's a little bit unusual yeah Tarzan and Caroline Beasley ever see them swinging around

[00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:20.500]
together I hear that Joyce is a real swing or two like to have I'd like to have her up on a rope

[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:26.820]
on a tree all the hanging from it her from one limb and Tom direct from the other that old expression

[00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:33.000]
from limb to limb there's a really cute line in that bit too about like a candle I saw at a

[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:40.220]
fart fest that was kind of good yeah Bill aimed at reducing crashes of race day driving age to 17

[00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:47.040]
what do you think yeah whatever I say you know because we're always discriminating against young

[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:50.920]
people in Florida I say I have no problem with that because most teenagers drive like lunatics

[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:54.940]
anyway and are like a threat on the road but if they're going to do that let's also like

[00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:59.840]
pair it down on the other end on the top end hey man and that is if they've your old age is 70 for

[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:04.060]
example we take away old but that'll never happen no of course not because they're the ones that

[00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:10.320]
vote right the great they don't vote and they can't vote anyway under so you know 18 attention

[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:14.760]
teenagers the state legislature may make you wait an extra year to get behind the wheel of a car

[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:20.040]
or at least to drive legally anyway thousands of Florida 16 year olds are killed or injured in

[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:24.900]
car crashes every year a statistic that spurred at least one oh legislative call for increasing the

[00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:31.700]
states driving age from 16 to 17 that extra year the kids needed said herb slothberg democrat of

[00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:38.540]
boca herb slothberg boy their brain hasn't matured hey herb I wonder if your brain has matured

[00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:42.360]
sometimes I relate this to trying to pour a gallon bottle of milk into a pint and it just

[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:49.000]
overflows they can't take in all that information do you understand what that means no I mean it would

[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.860]
be one thing to say the theory responsible and at that testosterone is flown all those teenage

[00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:56.980]
guys and they're like one I think they're hot shots out there and they want to go out there and

[00:40:56.980 --> 00:41:00.600]
race like crazy and they're killing people that's the only one thing they the only ones though say

[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:05.180]
them concerned about the driving in general yeah the driving in general sucks and of course when

[00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:09.180]
you have people getting their drivers license in a cracker jacks box and they write there's no there's

[00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:14.620]
no inspection vehicle inspection they got all these people with no insurance with ball tires and no

[00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:20.180]
brace it makes for a very very fun combination a lethal mix out there in a highways but this is

[00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:24.180]
another one was like put a band-aid on the Titanic kind of solution they always come up with in Florida

[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:29.340]
because you got a bunch of spineless political cowards and as a result they don't want to press off

[00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:32.500]
the old folks they don't want to do and of course remember that we went through that whole scam

[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:38.300]
well how much did it cost eight bucks for what that that that that needs to stick that thing up your

[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:48.920]
eight bucks up your two two that used to up your two I thought it would like 12 or so was it

[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:53.940]
scam that was an absolute scam the auto emission test where you had to go in it would be like a bunch

[00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:59.000]
of illegal aliens it just hopped off a banana boat and they just in there are sticking that long

[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:05.740]
view of your car's butt Florida's been one of the most aggressive states in restricting teen driving

[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:10.420]
well of course keep sticking to the young people that's right stick it to the punks wait a

[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:14.180]
little bit the new chase all in people away from spring break chase anybody under 100 away

[00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:19.000]
anybody let's have more and more specials for the early bird if you're over the age of 100 we

[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.200]
can give you like a special discount on your you know colossal bag but anything else for charger

[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:29.500]
double to make up for it when compared to other age groups drivers age 15 19 had the highest

[00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:35.080]
rate of accidents and fatal crashes in 2004 15 to 19 of course they don't see once statistic

[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:39.920]
failure you'll ever see is the number of crashes in Florida that are caused by old fart's driving

[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:44.160]
who forced the rest of us to like take evasive measures desperate to like go more than five

[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:48.740]
miles an hour in the passing lane if I can find it South Park had a hysterical episode about old people

[00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:53.740]
driving really or make your pants was it Tom Cruise in the giant revolter right it'll make you

[00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:59.660]
fill your bag no no it had the AARP commandos in it that was that was just nation-wide 16 year olds

[00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:03.680]
had the highest crash risk twice as high as 18 to 19 year olds according well 16 year olds

[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:09.520]
be driving anyway it's common sense and I think maybe it's time slasper said he also said

[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:15.800]
his plan hb975 is similar to measures pending several states although we can see it could be

[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:20.600]
a multi-year process to win enough votes to make the change Florida became one of the first dates

[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:25.220]
to begin placing tougher restrictions on novice drivers when in 1996 legislators passed the

[00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:32.220]
cinder relevil admit that you turned into a pumpkin I see and you put on these little flippers

[00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:36.980]
establishing phased in licenses that put nighttime restrictions on drivers under the age of 18

[00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:41.520]
within a year those changes reduce crashes involving fatalities injuries by 11%

[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:46.620]
in the 15 to 17 year old age group how come we just don't make it like 25 okay if you're not

[00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:51.060]
25 you can't drive how do you like that you know in Montana I don't know we're not too happy

[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:55.580]
that you're alive and you know jive yes in Montana you can get your driver's license at 15 I don't

[00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:59.280]
know if that's the case anymore but I got my time I recall when I was a punk I think I got mine at

[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:04.080]
15 you get a restricted license in New York state that's 100 years ago regular license 15 if you

[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:08.520]
highlight resentment I mean you're gonna actually hit somebody else in a highway there loose maybe

[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:14.780]
then that's about the biggest danger or maybe an elk you know those are some of my I just I

[00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:19.500]
can't even tell you how embarrassed I am by those people the one the larger the larger the VFW people

[00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:27.540]
are where those silly hats on the elx oh my the FW is a little better you but oh look it's just

[00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:32.380]
an excuse yeah I have no life listen it's just an excuse to have a place to go and play cards and

[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:38.640]
drink and drink and drink like right now and drink before you go out of the garden the death of

[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:42.860]
Justin Marx a 15 year old rolling vintine kill in the car wreck with two teenage trends prompted

[00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:47.480]
to push for even more change in 2000 lawmakers agreed to make teens wait longer to get their licenses

[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:51.780]
forcing them to first hold a learners permit for a four year instead of just six months plus get

[00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:57.420]
50 hours of supervised behind the wheel experience fatal crash involvements for 16 year olds fell

[00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:03.700]
26% from 1993 in 2003 as states began to enact graduated licensing laws but this hasn't solved

[00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:07.940]
the problem by any means motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for teenagers the later

[00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:13.700]
they start driving the better like about 40 would be good what do you say all right I'm thinking like

[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:20.760]
63 is a good age to start driving I'd say that's one thing I don't miss I would say the drivers

[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:24.740]
here are like much more yeah not not the best but certainly more civilized than there but that could

[00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:30.000]
be said of anywhere you could say that about the drivers in Rome even the ones on their vetsford

[00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:35.860]
but I just I don't miss it it's just every because you know I used to enjoy that so much

[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:39.540]
especially when I had my early Corvette you know back in the day when you can actually drive and go

[00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:43.580]
somewhere and now it's just a nightmare you can't go anywhere anywhere because they're like if you

[00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:48.120]
be two blocks there's another progress in there with is with his long radar you suck out the window

[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:53.640]
you know waiting to write some business old porkeys in addition which is like some oil like you're

[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:57.520]
like I'm university drive trying to go north especially like from sunrise north have you ever

[00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:01.760]
tried to go there yeah look up into tamarind forget about it you can't you can't get there from here

[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:06.480]
because all the old parts here in the left hand lane with a sitting on 14 telephone books where

[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:10.100]
head like just go up to the bottom of the steering wheel yeah I live in Hollywood you're talking to

[00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:14.940]
me and let me say it again I just got a six year renewal on my drivers license in the mail another

[00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:19.900]
another blue sticker to put there on the back of my tank they don't know whether I'm deaf dumb blind

[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:25.780]
quadruple amputee okay right oh that's even worse yeah or all of these things all of the

[00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:29.440]
all of these things and they sent it to me in the mail and you know it took like less than a week to

[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:35.160]
about four days if you've got 15 bucks in Florida you've got a driver's license baby you can be 90 like

[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:40.880]
my mother got a six year renewal in the math she was 90 and got a six year renewal so maybe it's

[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:44.660]
fortunate she didn't make it to like 96 you know what I'm saying she could still drive legally in

[00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:49.500]
the state all right you know something you're right if we could drag her ass out of that box and

[00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:54.220]
proper up behind a wheel she'd get her and she probably get another six year renewal that's the

[00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:59.400]
Florida F and Way but you punk's out there on you know I think the best message from the whole deal

[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:07.220]
is if you're in Florida just don't drive this day alive this is me a little Roger this is 5.62

[00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:08.900]
8.62

[00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:17.240]
this is your brain this is your brain on drugs this is your brain being chopped up by a final home meat

[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:24.360]
cleaver this is your brain in a blender and this is your brain being stirred into a big pot of chili

[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:35.660]
brains real food for real people forget Jason forget Franny forget y'all so even heraldum

[00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:42.000]
there's a monster out there on the streets that could strike at any moments old people will drive

[00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:49.300]
that's right there's no escaping them because they're everywhere you go they drift from lane to lane

[00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:58.300]
they stalk the other states in second gear old people who drive I kick it around this guy look

[00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:08.600]
out honey you're backing up backing up you don't know what they're doing next until slowly they drive you

[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:16.100]
coming soon to an intersection or prep or parking lot near you this 11.2.5.60 WQ I'm by the way

[00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:19.500]
if you believe that prostitution's illegal in Florida you've never heard this radio station

[00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:24.500]
anyway more in downrights by sure got a lot of stuff to read here today you know I got that big

[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:29.480]
high I don't know what you call you what's wrong with you me what calls both of them there are a

[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:35.640]

goes on there damn well I guess Andy Rooney's about as much as you can get huh all right Franny okay

[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:55.280]
happy 30 and back to you happy what do you say about 30 man that's my 30th anniversary gift from

[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:58.760]
the radio stations I got stabbed in a back of you in this morning and you were witness to it both

[00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:04.260]
here you saw it I was made know for I really couldn't refuse wasn't I yeah okay you saw the way it

[00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:10.540]
was presented like you know do it for a doofus and what do I tell you about glad handers guys it's

[00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:14.460]
my like I kind of agree with everything you say and then but I'm being when you're not looking all

[00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:18.880]
of a sudden your back starts gushing blood like the acid of virgin Mary and at South Park episode

[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:27.560]
that's how I feel it's always the same the end result is always the same okay the people and the

[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:31.340]
the sad part of it is that the people who do the least for the radio station like Todd Dreck people

[00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:35.240]
like him who are running their own boiler room back there in sales people like him always get

[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:38.780]
their way in the rest of us well and you do whatever we tell you man you go step along but

[00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:45.120]
you guys are opinion yes we just tolerate you because you know we get those numbers man just just

[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:49.960]
absolutely outrageous what's going on and then all those stories the clearance told us and

[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:54.000]
did not tell you he'd be taken off again for a couple days to do basketball yeah you did did I tell

[00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:00.780]
you that you did that that's not changing nothing is changing just like Jack Webb used to say only

[00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:06.140]
the names have been changed to predict the guilty and that's exactly what we do here at QM the

[00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:12.160]
spaces keep changing but the plot continues to darken and thicken it's like that chocolate ganache

[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:16.640]
I was talking about it just keeps getting darker and thicker and darker and thicker you can go

[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:23.260]
like into an insulin coma just looking at it any idea what I'm talking about no me either does

[00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:26.580]
eyebrows have a hyphen or is it yeah why are you really putting eyebrows on there that's

[00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:31.560]
fucking your eyebrows but in other words you're saying you're saying that straight guys when they

[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:34.980]
go get a haircut they don't have the barber trim their eyebrows that's not what I'm saying at all

[00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:43.940]
what guys who pluck their eyebrows shape them sculpt them you know they're all seen uh then my

[00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:49.220]
not not nothing makes it great but in my case I have to I do that because I don't go to the

[00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:53.280]
barber anymore I shave my own head listen every once in a while I get this random gray eyebrow

[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:58.640]
I get like I get out on one I don't know why maybe I got a little blind in you I'm not gonna say

[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:04.000]
that we're talking about the guys that sculpt and shape their eyebrows oh that's awfully oh yeah

[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:12.100]
okay go put that on there how many QAM hello how many QAM hello how many QAM hello

[00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:18.720]
hey Neil yes sir I heard you talking about American History X the other day great movie great movie

[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:23.460]
indeed there's a couple other movies you should check out if you haven't where that Edward Norton

[00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:30.320]
has does the great performance and you want to one is called the score with a Robert Nero and

[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:34.980]
I think it was Marlon Brando's last film he did before he crows and the other is rounders

[00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:40.540]
that's what John the Tarot and John Nakavitch and Matt Damon

[00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:46.940]
rounders what's that about you keep hearing about rounders yeah I've heard it's sort of based around

[00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:55.020]
poker but like being a six-footer player yeah but it's more involved than just like you know

[00:51:55.020 --> 00:52:00.980]
a card game type type P L but it's sort of that's sort of what he does he gets out of prison and then

[00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:06.540]
you know Matt Damon we meet up with him again and they sort of used to be high stakes players and

[00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:10.320]
sort of play the field so then I don't want to stick with the score I'll check that one out first

[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:16.500]
okay okay thank you thank you thanks yeah anything into with cards puts me into a coma I don't

[00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:20.980]
care whether Hank believes that story or not I do and it may have been said partly in just and

[00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:26.560]
as an exaggeration ever but in other words and in other words their betting on games is the point

[00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:31.700]
whether it was a hundred grand or ten grand or whatever you know that's right or this is the

[00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:37.640]
point but then again Hank is the gambling analyst he's the specialist on that so and how would he

[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:44.060]
know about placing bets to Mafia connected people anyway in Jersey five six seven oh five sixty

[00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:47.940]
you think I probably know anything about that he's heard stuff about

[00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:53.820]
now well he knows any of those people and certainly we got a way to deal with Todd Dreck I think

[00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:59.280]
we probably got the final solution five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty in the Verizon

[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:07.580]
Singular wireless line deputy QAM hello deal yes sir how you doing all right all right I get

[00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:14.080]

was coming between Dick Cheney and his helpless prey the luck was 78 year old Texas lawyer Harry

[01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:31.500]
winning ten is intensive care after a heart attack with up to 200 pellets waddling his face in

[01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:37.160]

promised a winning to put himself in the wrong place at the wrong time but he was after all behind

[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:55.640]
vice not in front of him and a hundred of the trigger supposed to make sure he's got a clear shot

[01:03:55.640 --> 01:04:00.780]
wouldn't it be well classy for a shooter to express his to bitter contrition and humility instead

[01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:05.260]
the usual slimy has begun with a chain camp trying to protect the vice president by casting

[01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:10.180]
a veteran hunter is elmered dud scott McClendon told the White House press corps that Katherine

[01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:14.460]
Armstrong a lobbyist with government ties who owns the Texas ranch and whose mother Anne was

[01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:19.540]
on a halibutin board that hired mr. cheney as CE oh pointed out that the protocol was not

[01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:24.640]
followed by mr. wouldings and when it came to notify the others that he was there as the story

[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:28.640]
of the weekends bizarre hunting accident is wrenched out of the White House the picture isn't pretty

[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:33.680]
with american soldiers dying in Iraq five deferment Dick I had other priorities in the 60s

[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:38.360]
and military service cheney gets his macho kicks gunning down little birds in the occasional old man

[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:42.600]
while w rises bike blissfully oblivious to any collateral damage don't forget the mission is

[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:46.780]
a canned hunts that he engages in right shouldn't these guys work on weekends until we figure

[01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:51.480]
out how to fix a raccoon whirling's medic here in gas prices okay and hunts they make a hell of a

[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:57.060]
sauce not this version of the most dangerous game neatly follows the four step bush cheney cycle

[01:04:57.060 --> 01:05:02.460]
step one set out to pick off what you think is an easy target like quail this time or pen raised

[01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:08.000]
and knitted feson in the past or a certain sanctioned cage Iraqi dictator step two in the corrupt

[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.700]
company of lobbyist contractor friends botched things up ignore the peril at hand as with oh

[01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:18.020]
osama atorabora or Katrina or the rack occupation and with steely resolve indulge your raging

[01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:25.180]
incompetence oops step three stone wall resist giving congress information about 9-11 or Katrina

[01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:29.440]
don't tell the public how you're tapping phones at home setting up ghouls abroad and making

[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:33.800]
more energy policy and secret like if the taxpayers were pulling up for these weekend hunting

[01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:37.440]
trivia extraordinary news that a vice shot is hunting companion in the face and chest

[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:41.260]
Scott McFellon knew before yesterday's White House brefig at noon that mr. Wittington was

[01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:45.820]
but didn't help reporters he left that to corpus christy doctors who spun the heart attack as

[01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:52.340]
an inflammatory response to a metallic foreign BB step four admit no mistakes express sympathy blame

[01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:55.900]
the victim without leaving fingerprints by outsourcing the smeared the private sector

[01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:00.280]
tradlocked joke the meeting yesterday the mr. cheney was now the shooter in chief while

[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:05.620]
other at wax noted that quail was always a problem for the bushes that's what the capital cue that's

[01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:09.880]
here presidential staff members and lawmakers speculated yesterday by whether the shooter would

[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:14.480]
resign and make room for kandy if mr. wittington did not survive his death would trigger a more

[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:19.380]
thorough police investigation and probably a grand jury are you crazy one republican senator

[01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:24.140]
told reporter he'd never quit Aaron Burr presided over the senate after he killed Alexander Hamilton

[01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:29.220]
and dual the shooter achieved can't quit because he is the administration who'd even tell him to quit

[01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:33.880]
if necessary probably make the ability to take the fall despite efforts by mr. McFellon to joker

[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:38.900]
nerd reporters to get back to the pressing priorities of the american people the hunting debacle once

[01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:43.560]
more showed mr. cheney running the imperial show he didn't talk to the sheriff for 14 hours we

[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:47.800]
even called a president to notify him after the five fifty p.m. accident vice-left that to Andy

[01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:51.840]
car to call mr. bush at seven thirty to say that there been a hunting accident without mentioning

[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:56.100]
the vice was the gunman soon after that mr. roe called mr. bush back with that little detail

[01:06:56.560 --> 01:07:00.880]
a reporter surprised press mr. mary colon the vice president didn't call the president to tell him

[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:05.140]
he was the shooter usually when there's a white house cover up the president's in on it

[01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:09.360]
cute there's more you know it's short and sweet today you go honey

[01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:15.380]
so clearest is leaving for two or three days to go to another silly basketball game up in Boston

[01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:24.680]
oh boy that's all gonna change though you'll see oh oh god it's in the pain is so great

[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:28.420]
and you know what i tried to tell you and you all listen to me i better run to watch a couple more

[01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:33.440]
times than you have all your all your whipped up and food yeah i just because you guys don't speak

[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:38.160]
the same language that doesn't mean that you know that i'm wrong but what does that mean you can

[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:43.540]
let me just tell me this conversation that you had i go on and then you uh mean that you think

[01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:47.880]
that means something else oh i see i'm not even talking about that i'm not going to bring

[01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:53.520]
you talking about far so that's oh no i'm talking about everything uh and as far as that goes well

[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:58.680]
that all of that remains to be seen too what is the gase thing is so called straight guy can do

[01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:03.260]
kiss another guy hundred and eighty eight we're a thong at the beach one forty three oh

[01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:08.000]
kiss another guy just went to two hundred even that's a hundred that's a hundred pair of guys kissing

[01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:13.200]
we're a thong at the beach one forty three make it for turnity hazing one twenty eight to me i

[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:17.520]
just can't even imagine anything more faggy than that other than of course this oboe government

[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:21.920]
of stuff i think that it would be good day to play that uh that that hazing call that you took that

[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:27.100]
one time no okay guys with navel are all piercing sixty it's too long and it's ponderous and it's

[01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:33.320]
got to do with hockey well kind of very short shorts fifty eight that where uh fanny pack

[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:40.600]
flag bag forty six get a manicure slice pedicure forty three hold a small dog while driving forty

[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:46.440]
unless you're under seventeen listen to the aradius thirty eight just wear a sweater around your

[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:52.600]
neck or tywin around your neck tywin on thirty seven uh highlight your hair thirty four watch

[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:58.300]
bear ass mountain thirty three ass laughing twenty three four democrats twenty one use body wash

[01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:07.320]
seventeen wear pink shirts sixteen wear a thumb ring is uh fifteen guys who like cats fourteen

[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:14.320]
guys who like musicals fourteen watch soap operas twelve going to the gym nine going to

[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:19.600]
Michael Jackson concert nine right escuda reveta eight guys who like McCawley kalkin seven you

[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:25.380]
gotta be sulking wear a ladies watch so much in your body here six right attendant bike five

[01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:31.180]
wearing colored contact lenses tinted three wear green on thursday three don't do it tomorrow morning

[01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:35.760]
right now people be running around laughing their ass going you fair like that you won't hear what they're

[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:44.220]
doing wear bracelets three plucking your hair eyebrows to cry at a movie to find carpenter CDs one

[01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:48.300]
and watch figure skating just went on their none yet ten ninety seven by the bottom of the hour

[01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:53.740]
we're gonna have eleven hundred votes and then some are to impress uh media impressed i'm depressed

[01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:59.800]
so the score and rounders how did you see the one of them with uh Edward Norton i don't think i did

[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:04.380]
i'll tell you what you did to yesterday though you guys had some good food again from john the

[01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:09.020]
baker just we did delicious goody pivoting as fresh i know john the baker from uh because he's

[01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:14.180]
almost as old as i am he's been doing it in town for over thirty years now so it ever takes

[01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:16.520]
sides with anyone against the family again

[01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:23.920]
in theaters now when a stranger calls

[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:30.340]
hi this is Paul from surprise place center we have great news for you regarding the content

[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:35.580]
let's be Jill you were so thrilled to find your babysitter at the last minute

[01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:40.500]
this is great that i'm calling the guy in the entry form that you had filled out at

[01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:42.860]
keeps on calling your safe inside the house

[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:47.060]
why are you doing this and what do you want

[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:51.860]
love unfortunately i do have time again but we have the police

[01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:53.680]
stop calling me

[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:57.180]
Jill is the police which breaks the call it's coming from inside the house

[01:10:57.180 --> 01:10:59.860]
do you hear me coming from inside the house

[01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:04.980]
you guys have actually wanted to do one of our top four major prizes

[01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:05.460]
thank you

[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:11.340]
don't do it save your money bear ass mountain and when a stranger calls i just save you like

[01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:17.740]
12 bucks a piece oh that's what no no problem that was a safe bet i wasn't gonna do that

[01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:20.800]
my i'm not talking about you oh they just showed some pictures together oh my god

[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:24.980]
asked to ask i think that were you watching that uh what channel my own

[01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:30.740]
MSNBC is it the end of the uh i'm on uh spanish tv hintive they're having a uh little news

[01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:33.760]
update there oh not for me nice premiere is they saying they're worth

[01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:37.420]
pixelating in the greater checker publicly so that nice premiere

[01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:40.820]
anyway life is likely to have emerged in warm puddles of fresh water

[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:46.260]
you see this no study pours cold water on Darwin's theory of life

[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:51.440]
life is likely to have emerged in warm puddles of fresh water and not the piping hot volcanic

[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:55.120]
springs that have often been proposed as its source research is suggesting

[01:11:56.700 --> 01:12:00.000]
so in other words you came out of a puddle of water yeah i knew that

[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:05.240]
and experiment to recreate the conditions in which life began is revealed that the hot

[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:10.520]
hot acidic clay-filled waters that have had been proposed as prime candidates are probably

[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:15.520]
incapable of missing organic matter in the right way so forget about that volcano even though it

[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:20.700]
does have certain Freudian overtones to the idea that the origin of life might be traced

[01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:25.880]
upon zwarmed by volcanic heat or around underwater hydrothermal vents was first put forward by Charles

[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:30.640]
in the letter in 1871 and the theory became accepted as one of the most likely explanations

[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:36.500]
it suggested that a combination of organic compounds such as amino acids acidic waters rich

[01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:39.940]
and that's acidic waters rich in clay and heat could have led to the information of the

[01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:44.980]
complex molecules that kick started life i got news for you we got plenty of people in that

[01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:50.940]
building out of get kick started right now god well wouldn't be something if somebody could

[01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:55.520]
actually stand up and be a man and that's how the problem is opposed to like always a g it's like

[01:12:55.520 --> 01:13:00.100]
a little kid in school Johnny's picking at me to spit balls and stand up and be Johnny the

[01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:06.600]
beat the crap bottom okay be a man right right since you plan all these godfather quotes and by

[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:15.760]
the way don't ever take sides against the family again exactly a team led by David dream or a

[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:21.800]
deemer of the University of California at Santa Cruz has put this hypothesis to the test by

[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:26.860]
in hypothesis to the test by investigating volcanic springs of this sort in cancetta in

[01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:32.460]
Russia and not lashing in California he found the contrary to expectations these springs were

[01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:37.060]
poor environments for the formation of these molecules when organic material was added to the

[01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:40.600]
pools they clay particles attached themselves to it and prevented the chemical reaction that

[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:44.780]
could be important to the formation of life the findings which will be presented day at the

[01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:49.160]
world society conference in London so i'm sure that's already been done suggest that life is more

[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:55.080]
elected to emerge in shallow cooler pools of fresh water these would have been of neutral pH

[01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:59.480]
with less intense heat source and the water would have evaporated frequently concentrating organic

[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:04.680]
material it's about 140 years since Charles Darwin suggested the life of maybe

[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:09.220]
begun in a warm little pond professor deemer said we're now testing Darwin's idea but in hot

[01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:13.860]
little puddles associated with the volcanic regions of camcetta and mountain lashing the result

[01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:18.240]
of results are surprising in some ways disappointing it seems that hot acidic waters containing clay

[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:22.020]
do not provide the right conditions for chemicals to assemble themselves into pioneer organisms

[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:26.980]
we found that organic compounds such as amino acids in the basis of DNA which are the

[01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:30.680]
building blocks for life it came strongly help the surfaces of clay particles in the volcanic

[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:35.820]
pools in camcetta phosphate another essential ingredient for life also became help of the surface

[01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:41.040]
of the clay we saw the same thing in a boiling pool at Mount Lassen i wonder if i'll wait in

[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:46.500]
this life had any best in that boiling pool in our experiments the organic compounds became so

[01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:49.840]
strong in helping to clay particles that they could not have to go any further chemical reaction

[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:54.240]
in addition when we introduced soap like molecules into the pools they didn't form a membrane which

[01:14:54.240 --> 01:15:01.560]
would be quite a form cell so they are warm puddles okay that's it i'll take it have a few puddles

[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:05.100]
and make some babies in a warm puddle that's that's what we're like begin by the way something have

[01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:10.580]
we gotten a good series of pictures to post on the website with regards to this new story well i

[01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:15.160]
have passed along the link there to the story and the story does contain the pictures and i'm sure

[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:18.840]
that if people will click on the link when they get to that story they'll find the pictures

[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:24.740]
i was just wondering i'll compare what we've got to is it the raw story story no okay i don't believe

[01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:28.600]
so what is it do we know i don't think it's better for today it's the raw story story

[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:32.020]
a bokeh brine and just sent me a link to it it's got a whole bunch of graphic pictures there

[01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:35.040]
well how do you know that's the one that i got i don't know that's why i was asking

[01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:42.740]
oh man you really are in a porcupinew today you've got to get your tassels out i think i

[01:15:42.740 --> 01:15:46.280]
sure a little on the test these so he's going to bring me some antibiotics today since we don't

[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:49.860]
have our connective nobody's going to bring you no pills we don't got that your boyfriend no more

[01:15:49.860 --> 01:15:55.260]
my boyfriend my close personal buddy we don't got him no more call up Roy Black he probably

[01:15:55.260 --> 01:16:00.220]
knows Russia's phone number that those kind of pills yeah he gets your will month and get you like

[01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:08.500]
some real good oxygen stuff oh there's your labor man in the in the man and Susan Collins

[01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:13.580]
was on just before why is it that there's so many wineries in Connecticut and Maine thank god

[01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:18.500]
for Massachusetts man where you got the fire and brimstone guys like Ted Kennedy right our

[01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:24.660]
eight powder John Kerry i'm sorry nobody's perfect five six seven oh five sixty pound five

[01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:29.000]
sixty and leave Verizon singular wireless line thanks to Deb again wasn't Deb that uh yeah

[01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:35.480]
for tomorrow's uh pool oh yeah the best cartoon character of all time i got a really good

[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:39.440]
western pack there is probably not too all of you like you said he can paste in cotton chew and

[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:44.260]
yes he can you just stuff and regurgitate it i think we got him all on there although i don't think

[01:16:44.260 --> 01:16:50.500]
we got what what's what's that other cat which other one which one do you have isn't the cat or a duck

[01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:58.240]
no it's a duck how the black duck not Donald duck dathy oh is it dapy duck yeah that's the duck

[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:04.880]
i don't think dapy duck is on his list well don't do it is on it well just a minute let me take a

[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:10.620]
peek at it oh yeah he's on there like i said a dapy duck is on and by the way they came

[01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:15.900]
he's out after him by uh you know George messin that and i think everybody knows that but

[01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:19.960]
did we ought to repeat it again in fact all the all these like when he goes out duck hunting with

[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:23.800]
the judge and these are all what i call fission and barrel shooting expert expedition you look

[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:29.320]
really with the calls at that yeah it's all contrived is what it is right these are canned

[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:35.960]
hunting expeditions it's kind of like you can't miss no self-respecting child would engage in such a

[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:40.040]
thing he's not self-respecting if he had a self-respect he wouldn't be the butcher of washin

[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:43.220]
and i want to why don't you go to the supermarket and shoot into the meat counter and in addition

[01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:46.220]
to which he's got a bull-dike daughter so he's got a lot of issues to deal with and he's got to

[01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:50.680]
take out his frustration on some little bird you know and on some old cute from a Texas right

[01:17:51.180 --> 01:17:58.420]
70 QIM hello hello yes sir i have a one for deals call that should be number one okay

[01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:04.260]
but i probably a little too late but i got the best one never too late do you want to hear it now

[01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:12.800]
i'm listening drinking wine cooler is wrong okay is your i got one yes okay that's number one

[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:17.440]
i don't think you wanted to even sell wine coolers anymore yeah i guess i don't know you big

[01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:22.580]
no while there i think they went by the wayside very short version of what i submitted for the record

[01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:26.600]
that there's a Mickey cheered off heck of a job Mickey go away you're doing a good job that's your

[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:32.940]
responsibility guy oh boy i feel so safe not being in the states five six seven oh five sixty

[01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:39.260]
pound five sixty neighbor rising singular wireless line nobody QIM hello

[01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:46.700]
QIM hey good morning yep yes sir i might have a good room for the ball maybe and maybe not

[01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:50.860]
you know my sky thought he had number one but i don't think so i'll show it to you um

[01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:59.260]
two or more guys with a girl you know something could ever happen you know three

[01:18:59.260 --> 01:19:04.900]
sins yes three ways i'd treat them two guys or there are more with the girl yeah and um if you

[01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:08.700]
work if you ever notice not not that we've ever seen any of those movies where that might be going on

[01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:14.040]
but you'll notice that there are there are male parts that occasionally wind up very in close proximity

[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:20.740]
to each other yeah that's a that's a great thing right and you know i have um if George

[01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:27.320]
needs any opsy con i have the forties in the eighties just rubbing and no man and not

[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:32.240]
for the moxasillin or something and and i also have more thing while he pops this is

[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:35.160]
okay or he's gonna sell those over and we can all use those you know he's gonna go away and

[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:39.480]
you didn't hang up on him right so it was over here and we all can use the amorphine quick

[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:45.200]
lots in the needle we can all use a good shot of something in fact a tied wreck

[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:51.980]
you think i'm a good shot for him follow up to ten he's got right there time okay mix is five sixteen

[01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:56.920]
what's up with your god from a sport home

[01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:02.460]
joy the

[01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:08.760]
oh

[01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:12.360]
your friend the way will back you all the way

[01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:31.200]
when you think of all the benefits you're getting life will be sweeter when you pass your

[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:40.740]
and for the me and for the chat and always and for the head they say well it's not best

[01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:47.340]
sharpen your skill in the forest but we'll be there to defend your right to hold us

[01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:54.680]
come on and don't wait to say and you'll be proud to say you're a member of the M.R.A.

[01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:00.580]
wasn't 47 i wonder whether they're gonna have me doing some of those gun show us spots live

[01:21:00.580 --> 01:21:05.700]

nevertheless the story is interesting you might oh yeah there is a great website the story says

[01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:27.680]
serious radio's Alex Bennett just broke a rumor that the delay in reporting the news that

[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:31.820]
chanee shot an old man in the heart was due to an effort to hide or spend chanee's female companion

[01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:39.100]
Pamela willaford ambassador Switzerland and lictans theme was part of the humming extruder with

[01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:44.100]
chanee and wittington and according to willaford's account chanee and ambassador were sied by each

[01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:48.980]
when the shooting wouldington took place the vice president secret service detail had to decide

[01:21:48.980 --> 01:21:52.860]
what to do with willaford by way of perhaps covering up a relationship with chanee and

[01:21:52.860 --> 01:21:56.760]
thus the delay in reporting the news the rumor goes that lynchanee isn't happy with chanee's close

relationship with miss willaford not even like that Pamela willaford ambassador to Switzerland and

so they can see all they in fact talk about raw

[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:47.580]
it doesn't get much more than that speaking of raw

[01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:50.640]
i think i read stuff might find this funny or not

[01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:52.880]
maybe to look for that song that carpenter song

[01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:54.740]
we have sick carpenters

[01:34:56.020 --> 01:34:58.260]
right not an obscure song at all

[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:02.660]
yeah so we have six carpenter CDs and that's the

[01:35:02.660 --> 01:35:04.360]
whole album that you were talking about right

[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:06.460]
you have that too nothing none of them have that

[01:35:06.460 --> 01:35:08.640]
well i mean it's not like going to be like the death of

[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:10.020]

[01:35:10.020 --> 01:35:12.440]
most of our audience are dead somehow get through the day

[01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:16.880]
not hearing karen's dulcintones and that great guitar riff there at the end

[01:35:17.820 --> 01:35:19.680]
down out out you remember that yes i did

[01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:23.680]
hmm good stuff that's the song is kind of more

[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:25.440]
than depressing so let's just hear the end of the

[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:28.140]
other well in other words boka brine don't have it

[01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:30.320]

and go on line more but i don't have that there's old mickey chard off

[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.040]
first your dissadventure republican panel riffs Katrina

[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:45.740]
response the response of government at all levels of her to her king

[01:35:45.740 --> 01:35:48.980]
Katrina was dismal poorly planned and badly

[01:35:48.980 --> 01:35:51.180]
coordinated showing that more than four years

[01:35:51.180 --> 01:35:53.760]
acted nine eleven terror attacks america is still

[01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:56.940]
out ready for prime time a house report concludes

[01:35:57.580 --> 01:36:00.960]
we're not ready for prime time it remains difficult to

[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:02.500]
understand how government could respond so

[01:36:02.500 --> 01:36:05.140]
ineffectively the way disaster that was anticipated for

[01:36:05.140 --> 01:36:07.540]
years and for which specific dire warnings have

[01:36:07.540 --> 01:36:10.140]
initiated for days the crisis was not only

[01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:12.960]
predictable it was predicted the committee said in the report if nine

[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:15.580]
level was a failure of imagination then Katrina was a

[01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:17.720]
failure of initiative was a failure of leadership

[01:36:18.580 --> 01:36:21.540]
the findings of the house investigative committee are striking because

[01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:25.200]
the panel consisted of eleven republicans the house democrats boycott of

[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:27.980]
the committee after pushing unsuccessfully for an independent probe

[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:32.660]
the panel to co-man security mickey chard off the test for waiting

[01:36:32.660 --> 01:36:35.900]
until two days after the storm hit to activate a national response plan

[01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:39.260]
and for appointing a brownie mickey brown and director of female

[01:36:39.260 --> 01:36:41.240]
believe the federal response even though he wasn't

[01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:44.600]
trained to take on that responsibility the report also said

[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:47.460]
president boost did not receive adequate advice and counsel

[01:36:47.460 --> 01:36:50.380]
from disaster officials in other words it was a disaster

[01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:54.120]
the panel concluded that earlier presidential involvement matter we saw

[01:36:54.120 --> 01:36:56.660]
that a more effective response it was an accident a lot of people got

[01:36:56.660 --> 01:37:00.380]
heard the White House also failed to de-conflict

[01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:03.240]
varying damage assessments and discounted information that

[01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:05.080]
ultimately proved to be accurate the committee said

[01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:08.440]
the report that runs more than five hundred pages called a response to Katrina

[01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:12.420]
a national failure and advocate of the most solemn obligation to provide for

[01:37:12.420 --> 01:37:17.440]
the common welfare at every level individual corporate philanthropic and

[01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:21.560]
governmental we feel the need to challenge that was Katrina in this cautionary

[01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:25.200]
tale all the little pigs build houses of straw the report said

[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:27.820]

[01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:33.160]

[01:56:47.900 --> 01:56:53.260]
going today i'm very confused uh this story is the lead story on our website right now a story in

[01:56:53.260 --> 01:56:58.260]
tv station releases new obelgarib torture photos okay which that is the story i had sent you

[01:56:58.860 --> 01:57:01.360]
now is that is that what we're putting on there

[01:57:02.840 --> 01:57:08.820]
mom just put huh yeah i put it on there i mean just now yeah well you see if we're going to do

[01:57:08.820 --> 01:57:11.560]
that then they're going to have to click on and then they're going to have to click the link to

[01:57:11.560 --> 01:57:16.360]
the article and then they'll go right to the roster and then they'll see the pictures see what

[01:57:16.360 --> 01:57:20.780]
i'm saying i mean they can do that for them it's like a threesome that's what you asked me to do

[01:57:20.780 --> 01:57:28.240]
didn't you no we want the roster in there and it is the roster that that is the

[01:57:28.240 --> 01:57:32.420]
story but the point is that the pictures if you want to see them you have to make like two

[01:57:32.420 --> 01:57:38.160]
three clicks or two clicks in other words uh they're not going to do it but i was thinking as we

[01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:42.020]
put it right smack that right on there because most of our people are too lazy to do that oh i

[01:57:42.020 --> 01:57:46.740]
say most most people are too lazy to even pick their own nose see what i'm saying all right

[01:57:46.740 --> 01:57:50.360]
you know what i'll be doing with the pictures i beg your pardon just the pictures

[01:57:53.980 --> 01:57:57.720]

[01:58:39.380 --> 01:58:44.360]
survey conducted last Thursday through sunday last weekend said it was very likely or somewhat

trace percentage points shortly after nine eleven per president boy's lab but we've been a

[01:59:03.480 --> 01:59:07.700]
bit of a bit of a quote the pool americans appear to be split over the legality of the domestic

[01:59:07.700 --> 01:59:12.420]
eavesdropping program about 49% of the residents have responded said the president had definitely

[01:59:12.420 --> 01:59:18.180]
a probably broken law 47% that he probably were definitely had not and like four percent said what

[01:59:18.180 --> 01:59:23.560]
you what should be talking about there you go a lot of paranoid people out there worried that

[01:59:23.560 --> 01:59:27.840]
somebody's tapping their phone conversations and opening up their mail and reading their emails

[01:59:27.840 --> 01:59:31.860]
and all of these things okay that's right that's what those tapping sounds i didn't know what

[01:59:31.860 --> 01:59:37.660]

[01:59:58.820 --> 02:00:02.940]

[02:00:02.940 --> 02:00:06.500]
kiss my ass but when the study of anniversary thing coming up you think that at least there'd be

[02:00:06.500 --> 02:00:10.380]
a little bit respect for the way i feel about certain things and believe you me i didn't

[02:00:10.380 --> 02:00:14.980]
be around to bush on this one i'd later write out there in the strongest possible terms

[02:00:14.980 --> 02:00:20.800]
in a two-part email and got a very specific explicit response and then but it would but it's all

[02:00:20.800 --> 02:00:24.920]
it's like it's like those shmata heads over there man they're doing their daily prayers and

[02:00:24.920 --> 02:00:28.160]

now about the hockey hazing historic think that's even low death no it is not it's three and a half

[02:02:51.780 --> 02:02:58.440]
goes like this like this just before his sixteenth birthday he cried out for the junior c team in

[02:02:58.440 --> 02:03:03.580]
tillbury near chatham ontario well i grew up in tillbury and i played all my minor hockey there and

[02:03:03.580 --> 02:03:10.860]
you know i i would have liked to play my hometown so it was a good feeling he made the team

[02:03:10.860 --> 02:03:16.020]
the tillbury hawks but he soon discovered that he couldn't be considered a real hawk until he'd

[02:03:16.020 --> 02:03:21.180]
been through an initiation party i can remember the coach saying that well he's gonna get to know us

[02:03:21.180 --> 02:03:26.860]
better and you know we're gonna have some fun and you know it's i thought it just give good time i

[02:03:26.860 --> 02:03:34.040]
get to know more the players more better and you know you're you're fifteen yeah what is it what's

[02:03:34.040 --> 02:03:42.060]
a good time mean to the fifteen year well just to get around you know meet the players you know

[02:03:42.060 --> 02:03:50.440]
play cards or you know just stuff like that watch tv or something he said that they would they

[02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:57.600]
be staying there overnight because they they didn't want anybody driving home that was drinking and i

[02:03:58.100 --> 02:04:03.120]
you know the my kind of assumption both out was i thought i knew there was some older players

[02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:08.280]
there and i kind of figured that's sort of what it was about i didn't really give it a second thought

[02:04:08.280 --> 02:04:14.220]
i know when i came home with my wife we felt pretty good about it you know like it was a pretty

[02:04:14.220 --> 02:04:20.360]
reassuring meeting is my first experience ever drinking never had alcohol before but his first

[02:04:20.360 --> 02:04:28.700]
few drinks would leave a lasting impression they played this little uh game of uh the funnel game

[02:04:28.700 --> 02:04:34.320]
i think it was or you know the four beers in and you'd have to funnel it down your throat and

[02:04:34.880 --> 02:04:43.580]
i mean after that i was pretty pretty much wasted the party was here the home of a prominent doctor

[02:04:43.580 --> 02:04:49.620]
was one of the team owners scott was shocked by what went on more so because there were adults

[02:04:49.620 --> 02:04:56.080]
present well they brought two two boys and at once and and made them strip and then all the coaches

[02:04:56.080 --> 02:05:03.680]
and managers and i started air with the lot of action players and there are two beer cops lying

[02:05:04.460 --> 02:05:12.520]
and uh about probably ten ten fifteen feet away from them and they told us to do pushups

[02:05:13.160 --> 02:05:22.080]
with our uh general to go in the beer cup they kept and uh took a marshmallow i remember

[02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:29.200]
he had rubber gloves on and uh he inserted it into the the players rectum and the player would have

[02:05:29.200 --> 02:05:36.040]
to well squat over a cup and try and get it into that cup and if the player missed he got to eat it

[02:05:37.060 --> 02:05:44.520]
out in a room there was like a pocket with a string attached to it paying over a chair with two

[02:05:44.520 --> 02:05:49.960]
hockey sticks in between and uh they'd make the rookie tie the string there's penis and then

[02:05:49.960 --> 02:05:55.760]
all of well a lot of the coaches that shouldn't add it all throw pucks in a pale so this uh the pale

[02:05:55.760 --> 02:06:01.240]
was hanging on the end of the string yeah there's no pucks in the pale yeah

[02:06:01.240 --> 02:06:13.200]
a little weird yeah the worst part like what i saw was uh the string and they're sitting on uh

[02:06:13.200 --> 02:06:23.380]
one of the other rookie space and i that just is uh disgusting with nothing with nothing uh

[02:06:23.380 --> 02:06:29.700]
this is Mio Rogeri mixed is five sixty two a

[02:06:29.700 --> 02:06:30.560]

[02:06:47.140 --> 02:06:48.980]
You're like a young man again!

[02:06:51.340 --> 02:06:54.420]
Say you know how to handle that, right?

[02:06:54.900 --> 02:06:55.400]
Of course.

[02:06:55.400 --> 02:06:58.260]
And I tell you what, yeah.

[02:06:58.680 --> 02:06:59.820]
Let's do it up.

[02:07:00.380 --> 02:07:03.060]
And you walk that way.

[02:07:03.660 --> 02:07:06.800]
And we'll surround the Wastgoly Web.

[02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:07.720]

You know, maybe Herrick could get that face transplant.

[02:07:33.380 --> 02:07:33.740]
What do you think?

[02:07:34.100 --> 02:07:35.060]
He can afford it.

[02:07:35.460 --> 02:07:35.860]
There you go.

[02:07:36.940 --> 02:07:37.940]

And also, wow, what a pile of stuff he sent me.

[02:07:43.540 --> 02:07:44.340]
I gave him all this stuff.

[02:07:44.460 --> 02:07:46.880]
I must have been laying around down there because I see my hand writing on it.

[02:07:46.960 --> 02:07:48.100]
Jackie Wilson, Bobby Diren.

[02:07:48.400 --> 02:07:48.600]

Those are the discs that he made for you that I asked you about.

[02:07:52.060 --> 02:07:52.600]
Then I left there.

[02:07:52.920 --> 02:07:52.940]
Right.

[02:07:53.400 --> 02:07:54.960]

[02:08:10.680 --> 02:08:12.580]
I ain't here for you.

[02:08:13.080 --> 02:08:15.040]
I'm not enough people to live.

[02:08:19.480 --> 02:08:19.880]
Yeah.

[02:08:27.280 --> 02:08:30.900]
I would have thought that it would be a little thanks to whoever who is this Chuck.

[02:08:31.180 --> 02:08:31.840]
Is that what that says?

[02:08:32.420 --> 02:08:32.900]
I don't know.

[02:08:33.260 --> 02:08:36.060]
Yeah, Chuck, that's somebody CKW who gave it to me in our air checks.

[02:08:36.620 --> 02:08:36.800]
Yes.

[02:08:39.140 --> 02:08:42.700]
Ladies and gentlemen, you're listening to Duke Robert CK.

[02:08:43.020 --> 02:08:43.340]
The

[02:08:46.440 --> 02:08:47.280]
one-on-one

[02:08:47.280 --> 02:08:48.420]
That's a big eight.

[02:08:48.660 --> 02:08:50.900]
Glad it's not with the most out stuff.

[02:08:53.140 --> 02:08:57.020]
In fact, by Mike better get ready because there might be some good jingles on these.

[02:08:57.180 --> 02:08:57.520]
Look out there.

[02:08:58.100 --> 02:08:59.180]
Yeah, look out my mind.

[02:09:01.580 --> 02:09:05.200]
560, 7.0560, 0.560 and leave a rising signal to the right of the sign.

[02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:07.320]
The only good thing about today is Zip-Flaw and really fast.

[02:09:07.480 --> 02:09:10.120]
I don't know why because I'm ready to kill somebody, but it's Zip-Flaw and really good

[02:09:10.120 --> 02:09:10.540]
and fast.

[02:09:10.540 --> 02:09:12.460]
Yeah, just like I'm going to zip out of here.

[02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:14.700]
And that's a good thing about going down there to get the discs.

[02:09:15.300 --> 02:09:16.940]
Have you an old dress put on my shoes?

[02:09:17.800 --> 02:09:21.340]
Just so I'm ready to hop up out of here at 2 o'clock and see Jews guys tomorrow.

[02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:25.380]
Hey, well let me ask you, do you want me to take off that story and just put up a link

[02:09:25.380 --> 02:09:26.200]
to the raw story?

[02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:27.160]
Well, let me ask you this.

[02:09:27.260 --> 02:09:28.340]
Is it possible to have both?

[02:09:28.680 --> 02:09:29.380]
Yes, sure.

[02:09:29.680 --> 02:09:31.380]
Well, then why would you want to take it off of there?

[02:09:31.980 --> 02:09:33.720]
Like I said, I just want a link.

[02:09:34.900 --> 02:09:35.480]
We'll do both.

[02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:36.040]
Okay.

[02:09:36.040 --> 02:09:41.780]
I just, I don't understand why this is such a project, you know.

[02:09:42.080 --> 02:09:43.260]
You just, you got the man scared.

[02:09:43.460 --> 02:09:44.780]
He wants to make sure that he's doing the right thing.

[02:09:45.620 --> 02:09:47.260]
Oh, yeah, I got somebody scared.

[02:09:47.260 --> 02:09:47.820]
Yeah, right.

[02:09:48.040 --> 02:09:48.640]
Oh, yeah.

[02:09:48.940 --> 02:09:49.420]
Uh-huh.

[02:09:49.940 --> 02:09:50.260]
Right.

[02:09:50.900 --> 02:09:53.380]
Clarex got you all upset and now you're taking it out on poor Josh.

[02:09:55.500 --> 02:09:56.620]
Well, you're going to start with Terrence.

[02:09:56.620 --> 02:09:59.740]
You're going to start with Peter Mosturizi who's telling us before before they show this

[02:09:59.740 --> 02:10:00.080]
morning.

[02:10:02.800 --> 02:10:03.680]
I'm documenting it.

[02:10:03.680 --> 02:10:04.980]
Why should I not have shut you up?

[02:10:05.500 --> 02:10:05.880]
What?

[02:10:06.480 --> 02:10:06.860]
Yeah.

[02:10:07.380 --> 02:10:09.940]
I don't want to put your view it over here.

[02:10:09.940 --> 02:10:10.420]
Yeah, exactly.

[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:11.480]
That's good.

[02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:16.560]
You just wait, man.

[02:10:16.680 --> 02:10:17.900]
Your day is coming when you're like this.

[02:10:18.040 --> 02:10:18.400]
I know.

[02:10:19.400 --> 02:10:23.760]
The documentary on the perils of Runaway Capitalism that spotlights Walmart screened at the

[02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:25.620]
Berlin Film Festival of this past weekend.

[02:10:26.060 --> 02:10:28.900]
And interest among European distributors and TV network has been strong.

[02:10:29.880 --> 02:10:34.740]
The feature-like documentary focuses on working conditions at the US retail giant and argues

[02:10:34.740 --> 02:10:39.100]
that the company treats its employees shavily in pursuit of maximum profit.

[02:10:39.260 --> 02:10:39.600]
Absolutely.

[02:10:41.060 --> 02:10:45.400]
Walmart is the poster job for the worst and corporate behavior US director Robert Greenwald

[02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:49.520]
said in an interview after his film, Walmart, the high cost of low price, screened away

[02:10:49.520 --> 02:10:50.800]
large and appreciative audience.

[02:10:51.540 --> 02:10:55.200]
But it is not only Walmart, it is these issues that affect all of us around the world

[02:10:55.200 --> 02:10:55.760]
he be saying.

[02:10:56.520 --> 02:11:00.360]
Walmart based in Bentonville, Arkansas has criticized the film by saying it's not an accurate

[02:11:00.360 --> 02:11:01.240]
portrayal of the company.

[02:11:01.940 --> 02:11:04.140]
Let's be clear about Mr. Greenwald's intent.

[02:11:04.480 --> 02:11:08.380]
It is not to present an accurate portrayal of Walmart to retailers in a statement last year.

[02:11:08.640 --> 02:11:12.080]
It's a propaganda video, pure and simple, designed to advance a narrow, special interest

[02:11:12.080 --> 02:11:12.760]
agenda.

[02:11:13.340 --> 02:11:14.940]
It must be that homosexual agenda.

[02:11:16.820 --> 02:11:21.260]
Greenwald's film which has sold 110,000 DVDs since November and has been shown in a limited

[02:11:21.260 --> 02:11:25.780]
theatrical release in the USA was set to be...

[02:11:25.780 --> 02:11:26.340]
Yeah.

[02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:30.160]
Does that something they did in the other room there?

[02:11:30.940 --> 02:11:32.120]
I'm going to go check that out again.

[02:11:32.280 --> 02:11:33.300]
Green on a button, probably.

[02:11:34.280 --> 02:11:36.020]
Hey Neil, if you can hear us, we can't hear you.

[02:11:36.360 --> 02:11:36.840]
Check your buttons.

[02:11:37.760 --> 02:11:38.120]
In the meantime.

[02:11:59.540 --> 02:12:02.980]
It's hard to bear a store worker, John Fanzza and the firm, film.

[02:12:04.060 --> 02:12:07.360]
Greenwald reports that wages and property values fell when Walmart came to town.

[02:12:07.800 --> 02:12:11.900]
Images of boarded up shops accompanied by haunting Bruce Springsteen songs deliver a powerful

[02:12:11.900 --> 02:12:15.320]
message about the existence of capitalism, one that scares many Europeans.

[02:12:16.360 --> 02:12:21.220]
Walmart is sucking down standards around the world, including interviews with ex-Walmar

[02:12:21.220 --> 02:12:24.980]
man, he was in poise during detailing for three of the staff.

[02:12:26.060 --> 02:12:27.900]
Like I said, you better watch it, Mr.

[02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:30.120]
You're a cutting-in and out for what it's worth.

[02:12:30.460 --> 02:12:31.180]
What do you mean by that?

[02:12:31.300 --> 02:12:34.020]
Not only that, but apparently the audio going back to you was cutting-in and out too.

[02:12:34.380 --> 02:12:34.540]
No.

[02:12:35.760 --> 02:12:37.820]
But you hear me say, hey Neil, we can't hear you so...

[02:12:37.820 --> 02:12:38.680]
No, I did not hear that.

[02:12:38.780 --> 02:12:39.540]
Well, I must have cut out.

[02:12:40.500 --> 02:12:40.820]
So...

[02:12:40.820 --> 02:12:42.020]
Was that why you were playing the music?

[02:12:42.300 --> 02:12:42.620]
Exactly.

[02:12:42.980 --> 02:12:45.660]
Oh, I thought you were trying to hear that story for what it's worth.

[02:12:46.060 --> 02:12:47.580]
You didn't hear any of this story about the Walmart?

[02:12:48.180 --> 02:12:49.160]
We heard the beginning of it.

[02:12:49.500 --> 02:12:50.380]
I think we're good now.

[02:12:50.480 --> 02:12:51.200]
I don't know what was going on.

[02:12:51.280 --> 02:12:52.100]
The line was dropping.

[02:12:53.680 --> 02:12:57.180]
Probably a Todd Dreckage back there, stomping on the phone line in the back in the

[02:12:57.180 --> 02:12:58.740]
van the engineering room.

[02:12:59.160 --> 02:12:59.660]
I wouldn't know it.

[02:13:00.200 --> 02:13:01.780]
It's probably a pochkin around with crap.

[02:13:03.240 --> 02:13:04.840]
Then that's the kind of appreciation I get.

[02:13:04.960 --> 02:13:07.560]
As opposed to even thank you up yours, ain't that...

[02:13:07.560 --> 02:13:08.260]
No, nothing.

[02:13:08.620 --> 02:13:09.020]
Just nothing.

[02:13:10.740 --> 02:13:12.580]
Don't darken my door again Todd.

[02:13:12.760 --> 02:13:17.260]
I'm going to say to that no matter whose purse rings are apron strings or whose skirt

[02:13:17.260 --> 02:13:20.820]
you're hiding behind or pantaloons just do not darken my door again.

[02:13:21.260 --> 02:13:22.880]
You quizzling, you idiot, you...

[02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:23.280]
You're fair.

[02:13:23.420 --> 02:13:23.580]
Yeah.

[02:13:24.540 --> 02:13:26.600]
Because after all that's what WQM is all about.

[02:13:26.660 --> 02:13:28.440]
It used to be all about Greg, but now he's gone.

[02:13:28.580 --> 02:13:30.720]
All that shenanigans that was going off, that's all gone.

[02:13:31.100 --> 02:13:32.660]
At least, well, at least some of it.

[02:13:33.300 --> 02:13:34.500]
So now it's all about Todd.

[02:13:34.500 --> 02:13:38.000]
In fact, we're changing the call letters from WQM to WTOD.

[02:13:38.380 --> 02:13:38.920]
Todd Radio.

[02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:41.700]
Remember Bobbi Todd with the Pimpley Bies?

[02:13:42.240 --> 02:13:42.840]
See you in the back here.

[02:13:44.140 --> 02:13:47.160]
Steve Cowdell with the WTOD Act Jackpot with $108.

[02:13:47.700 --> 02:13:48.780]
That's right, give it away.

[02:13:49.320 --> 02:13:52.440]
By Dickie Borne and Scott Reagan, he is Wilbert Harrison.

[02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:54.180]
We just got through it here in Wilbert.

[02:13:54.180 --> 02:13:55.880]
I don't want to hear no Wilbert Harrison, okay?

[02:13:56.320 --> 02:13:57.760]
I mean, thanks for the thing, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:13:58.380 --> 02:13:58.700]
Love each.

[02:13:59.040 --> 02:13:59.760]
No, don't.

[02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:01.060]
See KLW.

[02:14:02.300 --> 02:14:02.900]
See.

[02:14:04.260 --> 02:14:04.860]
Who?

[02:14:05.260 --> 02:14:06.740]
Oh, Clark is a pig.

[02:14:07.080 --> 02:14:07.080]

[02:14:08.360 --> 02:14:10.000]
This is Todd Riverview here.

[02:14:10.340 --> 02:14:11.580]
It's one of Clark's Detroit.

[02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:12.340]
Are you ready?

[02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:13.060]
I guess not.

[02:14:13.500 --> 02:14:14.760]
I'm so good.

[02:14:15.380 --> 02:14:15.940]
It's red.

[02:14:16.340 --> 02:14:17.960]
You're on a cellarator Saturday night, you.

[02:14:18.260 --> 02:14:18.840]
You just got to go out.

[02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:19.700]
I'm a pig.

[02:14:20.220 --> 02:14:20.940]
I'm a pig.

[02:14:22.260 --> 02:14:23.480]
I'm a pig.

[02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:23.640]

[02:14:23.720 --> 02:14:24.420]
I'm on news.

[02:14:24.920 --> 02:14:26.300]
See KLW.

[02:14:26.300 --> 02:14:28.840]
The cigarette is not going to stop now.

[02:14:28.940 --> 02:14:30.320]
Two old trees.

[02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:33.200]
The KLW is like, you know, this is Dick Todd Riverview.

[02:14:33.700 --> 02:14:35.180]
I'm not playing your favorite song.

[02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:36.740]
I'm going to Saturday night, you look beautiful.

[02:14:37.240 --> 02:14:37.740]
It's winter.

[02:14:37.900 --> 02:14:38.440]
It's two five.

[02:14:38.440 --> 02:14:39.780]
It looks sick, sick, sick.

[02:14:40.180 --> 02:14:40.580]
Detroit.

[02:14:40.880 --> 02:14:42.460]
You're not eight, eight, eight, two, two.

[02:14:42.680 --> 02:14:44.540]
Who's solid gold about Patrick's butt?

[02:14:45.020 --> 02:14:46.180]
It's the day I'm out.

[02:14:46.300 --> 02:14:47.160]
What a talk-up, huh?

[02:14:47.360 --> 02:14:48.480]
I absolutely want to pee.

[02:14:48.600 --> 02:14:49.460]
Oh, I agree with that.

[02:14:49.740 --> 02:14:49.880]
Wow.

[02:14:49.960 --> 02:14:51.260]
By the way, when Zepho coming back.

[02:14:51.980 --> 02:14:53.760]
This is Neil Roger.

[02:14:55.080 --> 02:14:59.920]
Don't you just hate people that use snappy openers for their show segments?

[02:15:00.480 --> 02:15:02.640]
Like that one-to-two-hour.

[02:15:03.220 --> 02:15:04.500]
Hi, this is Clay Aiken.

[02:15:04.740 --> 02:15:07.660]
Thank you for making my new single, The Number One Song in America.

[02:15:11.620 --> 02:15:12.720]
Yeah, girls, listen.

[02:15:13.260 --> 02:15:15.840]
Yes, we all have our moments, our difficult times,

[02:15:16.060 --> 02:15:18.480]
when our little friend comes to visit.

[02:15:18.840 --> 02:15:19.640]
I know what you're thinking.

[02:15:19.940 --> 02:15:21.180]
Clay, is it true?

[02:15:21.620 --> 02:15:23.340]
Do you have menstrual cramps like us?

[02:15:23.340 --> 02:15:24.560]
Why, of course I do.

[02:15:24.920 --> 02:15:29.340]
And that's why the maker of America's favorite muscle relaxer and pain killer has asked me,

[02:15:29.620 --> 02:15:33.580]
America's favorite T-C, to endorse the all new American My Dog.

[02:15:35.540 --> 02:15:36.800]
American My Dog.

[02:15:37.100 --> 02:15:40.840]
For those times you feel bloated, you're cramping, and you feel just downright bitchy.

[02:15:41.020 --> 02:15:42.800]
You know, when you're well, you're Aiken.

[02:15:44.700 --> 02:15:50.340]
American My Dog endorsed by me, Clay Aiken, the guy gal who finished second to that no-town at Ruben's Stutter.

[02:15:50.340 --> 02:15:53.480]
And you know, I still can't believe you people voted him as your American Idol.

[02:15:53.660 --> 02:15:54.600]
I mean, I had no idea.

[02:15:54.840 --> 02:15:58.020]
There were so many fat loser people out there who could operate a damn phone.

[02:15:58.280 --> 02:15:58.540]
I mean, what?

[02:15:58.620 --> 02:16:00.480]
Did all of you call from the pay phone at the audience?

[02:16:00.600 --> 02:16:01.240]
You can eat buffet place?

[02:16:01.540 --> 02:16:02.100]
I mean, really.

[02:16:02.280 --> 02:16:03.260]
I had no idea what's going on.

[02:16:03.300 --> 02:16:04.260]
American My Dog.

[02:16:04.740 --> 02:16:09.040]
For those times when life seems a little unfair, you only as directed.

[02:16:09.500 --> 02:16:10.700]
Here's a mobile in Bokeh.

[02:16:10.800 --> 02:16:10.920]
Hello.

[02:16:11.140 --> 02:16:11.940]
Yeah, how you doing?

[02:16:12.080 --> 02:16:12.700]
I'm doing okay.

[02:16:13.040 --> 02:16:17.860]
Well, you know, I wanted to talk to you a little bit about this fraternity business that you mentioned.

[02:16:17.860 --> 02:16:23.500]
And they just wanted to ask, if you have any best friends and how long have you had those best friends for?

[02:16:23.900 --> 02:16:24.560]
Well, what does that mean?

[02:16:24.980 --> 02:16:25.720]
Well, it means...

[02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:26.620]
What does that have to do with this?

[02:16:26.940 --> 02:16:28.240]
It has to do with everybody.

[02:16:28.360 --> 02:16:29.060]
Everybody has best friends.

[02:16:29.260 --> 02:16:30.620]
I mean, if they have any friends at all, sure.

[02:16:30.780 --> 02:16:32.360]
It has to do with the fraternity.

[02:16:32.500 --> 02:16:37.960]
And not necessarily taking showers or all the other hazing and whatnot that goes on.

[02:16:38.060 --> 02:16:40.600]
But it has to do with hanging out with a bunch of guys.

[02:16:40.740 --> 02:16:42.620]
I have two best friends.

[02:16:42.800 --> 02:16:43.820]
One is straight, one is gay.

[02:16:43.960 --> 02:16:45.320]
I've never had sex with either one of them.

[02:16:45.380 --> 02:16:46.640]
I've never seen either one of them naked.

[02:16:46.640 --> 02:16:48.740]
And we're having any desire to do either one of the above.

[02:16:49.160 --> 02:16:49.420]
Okay.

[02:16:49.860 --> 02:16:51.160]
Don't take showers with them.

[02:16:51.260 --> 02:16:52.460]
Don't stat towels at them.

[02:16:52.920 --> 02:16:53.100]
All right.

[02:16:53.260 --> 02:16:56.340]
In the fraternity house, we don't socialize by...

[02:16:56.340 --> 02:16:57.040]
...shows together.

[02:16:57.060 --> 02:17:01.240]
If a guy takes a shower, and the other guy's got to go to class, he goes in the shower as well.

[02:17:01.360 --> 02:17:03.320]
It's not a question of socializing in the shower.

[02:17:03.360 --> 02:17:05.740]
Well, I'm not talking about socializing in the shower fraternities.

[02:17:05.740 --> 02:17:09.220]
We're talking about hazing and initiations of fraternities and group sex.

[02:17:09.640 --> 02:17:11.540]
I'll tell you about hazing and initiation.

[02:17:11.540 --> 02:17:17.060]
When you're in the age of adolescence, 18, 19, and you're trying to find yourself in college,

[02:17:17.200 --> 02:17:22.440]
whatever it may college may be, fraternities lend itself to putting a bunch of guys that are like you.

[02:17:22.680 --> 02:17:23.480]
Would I say like you?

[02:17:23.580 --> 02:17:25.680]
I mean, they like the same interest they play, but they sports.

[02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:31.920]
They're a group of guys together that automatically, for some reason, I can't explain why,

[02:17:32.100 --> 02:17:33.420]
become your good friends for life.

[02:17:33.800 --> 02:17:37.700]
Now, when you have a good friend, and like I mentioned to you, when you have a best friend,

[02:17:37.780 --> 02:17:41.180]
or someone who's a good friend of yours, you share experiences with them.

[02:17:41.180 --> 02:17:45.740]
And part of becoming an actual experience is, no, well, it could be two guys on a girl,

[02:17:45.900 --> 02:17:47.760]
it could be two girls on two guys.

[02:17:47.920 --> 02:17:52.220]
It could be, you know, in the bathroom, four guys taking showers with four girls.

[02:17:52.540 --> 02:17:55.080]
The experience, sexual or non-sexual, they're relevant.

[02:17:55.540 --> 02:17:57.800]
No, no, it's not. It's not irrelevant at all.

[02:17:58.080 --> 02:17:58.660]
Of course, it is not.

[02:17:58.660 --> 02:18:03.420]
No, it is not. When you're in a fraternity, your goals are to make friends.

[02:18:03.520 --> 02:18:05.180]
Because you have friends.

[02:18:05.480 --> 02:18:09.520]
Sure, because you have a best friend, or a bunch of good friends, doesn't mean a,

[02:18:09.520 --> 02:18:12.840]
that you take showers with them because you're going to be friends for a long time.

[02:18:13.280 --> 02:18:16.800]
And B certainly doesn't mean that you share sexual experiences with them.

[02:18:16.800 --> 02:18:18.920]
Or can I, you know, have a group sector with them?

[02:18:19.020 --> 02:18:23.760]
Do you, you know, some of the, I belong to a health club, and in the health club that I belong to,

[02:18:23.840 --> 02:18:26.180]
it's a completely heterosexual health club.

[02:18:26.300 --> 02:18:26.460]
Yeah.

[02:18:26.580 --> 02:18:29.880]
But the shower is a shower with, with six thoughts on it.

[02:18:29.960 --> 02:18:33.580]
Now, do you think that I'd become part of that health club so that I can work out with guys

[02:18:33.580 --> 02:18:34.460]
and then go take showers?

[02:18:34.560 --> 02:18:35.380]
I have no idea.

[02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:36.880]
You can answer that question.

[02:18:37.520 --> 02:18:37.720]
Okay.

[02:18:38.820 --> 02:18:42.140]
I will tell you this, there are plenty of guys who do, but that's beside the point.

[02:18:42.320 --> 02:18:43.120]
That's beside the point.

[02:18:43.240 --> 02:18:44.240]
Me personally, I do not.

[02:18:44.320 --> 02:18:48.240]
That's a bastion of homosexual activity, even health clubs.

[02:18:48.580 --> 02:18:50.600]
I do not go and join the fraternity.

[02:18:50.600 --> 02:18:51.540]
No, we believe you.

[02:18:51.620 --> 02:18:53.400]
Don't sound offensive, we believe you, yeah.

[02:18:53.540 --> 02:18:58.660]
The point of a fraternity and communal showers and group sex and whatnot is not a question of how much sex works.

[02:18:58.660 --> 02:18:59.940]
What is the point of group sex?

[02:19:00.260 --> 02:19:04.740]
The point of a fraternity and hazing and the point of becoming a full-time mother.

[02:19:05.220 --> 02:19:06.220]
What is the point of making the mother?

[02:19:06.220 --> 02:19:08.400]
What is the point of making the young kids good-naked?

[02:19:09.160 --> 02:19:10.700]
I'll tell you exactly what it is.

[02:19:10.800 --> 02:19:13.860]
I'll tell you, I'll give you a grace for more than a fraternity.

[02:19:13.860 --> 02:19:14.100]
Please.

[02:19:14.260 --> 02:19:14.580]
That's right.

[02:19:14.960 --> 02:19:22.120]
When you belong to a fraternity, and I'll say it again, you belong to a bunch of guys that are going to be your friends for life.

[02:19:22.800 --> 02:19:25.300]
So why does that require them getting naked for you?

[02:19:25.660 --> 02:19:26.100]
Let me finish.

[02:19:26.200 --> 02:19:31.180]
Part of the experience of having a best friend, whether it may be a best friend that you play soccer with,

[02:19:31.180 --> 02:19:33.820]
whether it may be a best friend that you are drinking with,

[02:19:34.080 --> 02:19:38.420]
if you share intimate moments, not sexual moments.

[02:19:39.140 --> 02:19:39.940]
That's sexual.

[02:19:40.140 --> 02:19:41.900]
When I think intimate, I don't mean sexual.

[02:19:42.360 --> 02:19:48.000]
I mean intimate in the sense that you will not share that kind of experience with anybody else who's not your friend.

[02:19:48.300 --> 02:19:52.420]
For example, this sounds so faggy to me that even I'm a biris for you, sir.

[02:19:52.640 --> 02:19:53.340]
You want to know what it is?

[02:19:53.340 --> 02:19:54.520]
Sounds very faggy to me.

[02:19:54.820 --> 02:19:57.640]
Running through the beach naked with a bunch of guys.

[02:19:57.640 --> 02:20:00.060]
You can't experience with anybody else.

[02:20:00.140 --> 02:20:02.480]
Not even your wife or your kids or any other friends that you make your friends.

[02:20:02.480 --> 02:20:03.320]
Why would you run?

[02:20:03.680 --> 02:20:04.360]
Why would you run?

[02:20:04.600 --> 02:20:04.600]

[02:20:04.720 --> 02:20:04.720]

[02:20:04.860 --> 02:20:06.400]
Because I'm a birch naked with a bunch of guys.

[02:20:06.620 --> 02:20:07.500]
Why do you want to do that?

[02:20:08.080 --> 02:20:08.360]
Hold on.

[02:20:08.740 --> 02:20:10.300]
Hazing is not a question of you wanting.

[02:20:10.440 --> 02:20:11.080]
You don't have a choice.

[02:20:11.420 --> 02:20:11.600]
Right.

[02:20:11.960 --> 02:20:15.200]
Because one day, and why do you want to force these kids to be naked?

[02:20:15.540 --> 02:20:19.660]
Why do they always have to take their clothes off my, my clouded friend?

[02:20:19.960 --> 02:20:22.320]
That hangs out at the showers at the gym.

[02:20:22.480 --> 02:20:24.180]
Why don't you tell me the real story here, pal?

[02:20:24.180 --> 02:20:28.320]
On an everyday experience, people do not have an opportunity to walk around naked.

[02:20:28.580 --> 02:20:29.500]
Nor do they speak to you.

[02:20:29.520 --> 02:20:32.140]
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop with the small screen.

[02:20:32.360 --> 02:20:33.780]
Stop with the theme and the steam bath.

[02:20:33.940 --> 02:20:34.120]
Okay.

[02:20:34.460 --> 02:20:36.060]
Let's get back to the meat of the matter.

[02:20:36.380 --> 02:20:38.700]
Tell me why you want to see it make these guys get naked.

[02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:39.480]
What is that all about?

[02:20:39.840 --> 02:20:41.440]
It's a matter of respect.

[02:20:41.980 --> 02:20:42.380]
It's a matter of respect.

[02:20:42.380 --> 02:20:43.160]
Respect for what?

[02:20:43.360 --> 02:20:46.180]
No, it's a matter of lack of respect for them by you.

[02:20:46.360 --> 02:20:48.040]
It's a matter of lack of respect.

[02:20:48.280 --> 02:20:51.860]
If I respect somebody, I'm not going to force them to degrade themselves

[02:20:51.860 --> 02:20:55.220]
and embarrass and humiliate themselves in order to be part of my club.

[02:20:55.700 --> 02:21:00.500]
If you're going to be part of a particular group of friends and guys, who says that?

[02:21:00.500 --> 02:21:02.360]
I want to tell you this.

[02:21:02.560 --> 02:21:03.880]
I want to tell you this, okay?

[02:21:04.200 --> 02:21:06.160]
Without any more discussion, it's very simple.

[02:21:06.260 --> 02:21:11.600]
A child could tell you if somebody demands that I get naked in order to be their friend, I'll pass.

[02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.080]
There's a good message for all your kids out there.

[02:21:14.340 --> 02:21:21.840]
If any other male, your age, older, whatever, if they demand that you take your clothes off and engage in some kind of naked hands,

[02:21:38.440 --> 02:21:45.020]
then be in Turkey and think of who they are and if they want

[02:21:45.020 --> 02:21:51.820]
to fight a hurricane on top of their sea,achleagating,makes a fight,

[02:21:51.820 --> 02:21:55.020]
7 and 10, Boston Good TV, or Boston Bad TV.

[02:21:55.620 --> 02:21:56.980]
I was speaking to your Vice President,

[02:21:57.160 --> 02:21:58.440]
all the way first there to take some calls.

[02:21:58.620 --> 02:21:59.240]
QAM, hello.

[02:22:00.140 --> 02:22:01.520]
Hi, yeah, how you doing?

[02:22:01.780 --> 02:22:04.300]
This guy's never going to admit that he's a classic queen.

[02:22:04.620 --> 02:22:05.740]
Yeah, that's for damn sure.

[02:22:06.100 --> 02:22:07.580]
Yes, yes, yes.

[02:22:08.280 --> 02:22:09.540]
I don't know what to say.

[02:22:09.780 --> 02:22:12.080]
His greatest experience is running naked on the beach

[02:22:12.080 --> 02:22:13.500]
with his fellow frat guys.

[02:22:13.500 --> 02:22:15.480]
Hi, thanks.

[02:22:15.780 --> 02:22:16.580]
You're all the time.

[02:22:19.160 --> 02:22:20.020]
All right, dear.

[02:22:20.120 --> 02:22:20.360]
Thank you.

[02:22:20.700 --> 02:22:21.100]
Okay.

[02:22:21.540 --> 02:22:21.720]
Wow.

[02:22:21.800 --> 02:22:22.940]
I guess that guy's taking it.

[02:22:23.120 --> 02:22:23.640]
Anyway, you can.

[02:22:23.800 --> 02:22:23.900]
What?

[02:22:24.180 --> 02:22:24.900]
Easy, I heard.

[02:22:25.360 --> 02:22:27.080]
Oh, WQYM, hello.

[02:22:28.120 --> 02:22:29.060]
Good afternoon, Neil.

[02:22:29.160 --> 02:22:29.680]
Yes, sir.

[02:22:29.780 --> 02:22:30.400]
I have a answer.

[02:22:31.840 --> 02:22:33.300]
Thank you for the fine entertainment.

[02:22:34.760 --> 02:22:37.640]
Listen, last week or so, you were on one of your balls.

[02:22:37.660 --> 02:22:40.460]
You had somebody that killed the most,

[02:22:40.800 --> 02:22:42.620]
something, something, and pushed the second.

[02:22:42.620 --> 02:22:44.700]
What was the title of that place?

[02:22:46.300 --> 02:22:48.480]
WQYM, did you like this like the most?

[02:22:49.940 --> 02:22:50.940]
Okay, thank you, sir.

[02:22:51.060 --> 02:22:51.520]
Yeah, good day.

[02:22:51.720 --> 02:22:52.080]
You're welcome.

[02:22:52.520 --> 02:22:52.880]
That's right.

[02:22:53.880 --> 02:22:55.380]
What was the title of that thing?

[02:22:57.760 --> 02:22:59.320]
Oh, God, heaven help us.

[02:23:00.320 --> 02:23:02.220]
I'm like, my mind is just swimming, you know?

[02:23:02.560 --> 02:23:03.480]
It's kind of murky here.

[02:23:03.700 --> 02:23:04.760]
I'll look kind of out of my old side.

[02:23:04.880 --> 02:23:06.280]
Let's give it another one in Toronto Weather Reports.

[02:23:06.620 --> 02:23:06.740]
Yeah.

[02:23:06.740 --> 02:23:08.080]
By the way, definitely me alone already.

[02:23:08.200 --> 02:23:08.520]
Will you please?

[02:23:09.840 --> 02:23:11.720]
How are we told him that Harold's story turns out

[02:23:11.720 --> 02:23:13.400]
to be another sliced job by that Mark Fisher?

[02:23:13.640 --> 02:23:14.860]
His ass is grass.

[02:23:15.780 --> 02:23:16.860]
He's a dead man.

[02:23:18.380 --> 02:23:19.380]
Oh, but I know wonder.

[02:23:19.500 --> 02:23:20.820]
You know what the temperature is here now?

[02:23:21.280 --> 02:23:22.260]
I don't know, 78.

[02:23:22.960 --> 02:23:22.960]

[02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:25.120]
Is that good or bad?

[02:23:25.120 --> 02:23:25.820]
40, freaking.

[02:23:25.980 --> 02:23:27.340]
That's the 15th of February.

[02:23:27.400 --> 02:23:28.300]
What are you talking about?

[02:23:28.760 --> 02:23:30.400]
The normal high is like 28.

[02:23:30.840 --> 02:23:31.120]
Okay.

[02:23:31.720 --> 02:23:32.660]
It's 45.

[02:23:32.940 --> 02:23:33.840]
It's not like sunny random.

[02:23:33.940 --> 02:23:35.900]
It was a little murky, but it's warm enough.

[02:23:35.980 --> 02:23:37.720]
You can like toast marshmallows on my...

[02:23:38.240 --> 02:23:38.580]
Welcome.

[02:23:38.780 --> 02:23:39.220]
That too.

[02:23:40.020 --> 02:23:40.660]
How do you like that?

[02:23:41.700 --> 02:23:42.220]
All right.

[02:23:42.460 --> 02:23:43.660]
40, freaking.

[02:23:44.220 --> 02:23:44.540]
Five.

[02:23:45.200 --> 02:23:46.900]
But there's no such thing as global warming.

[02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:47.760]
Just keep that in mind.

[02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:48.180]
I will.

[02:23:48.800 --> 02:23:50.960]
As a matter of fact, I was watching the weather last night,

[02:23:50.960 --> 02:23:52.060]
and they were showing that the...

[02:23:52.060 --> 02:23:53.640]
I don't know any that much about meteorology.

[02:23:53.800 --> 02:23:56.720]
I mean, but they were showing the...

[02:23:57.140 --> 02:23:59.620]
The weather, the currents from west to east.

[02:24:00.400 --> 02:24:01.400]
What do they call the thing?

[02:24:02.360 --> 02:24:02.840]
The jet stream.

[02:24:03.560 --> 02:24:04.440]
See, I had no nothing.

[02:24:04.880 --> 02:24:07.600]
The jet stream is like from straight from west to east right now,

[02:24:07.640 --> 02:24:10.280]
which is one of the reasons that the Arctic air isn't like dipping down.

[02:24:10.280 --> 02:24:11.420]
Not to get too complex.

[02:24:11.820 --> 02:24:11.960]
Right.

[02:24:12.020 --> 02:24:12.760]
Call it Miss Norcross.

[02:24:13.800 --> 02:24:17.320]
But in a sense, the projection of the rest of February is only got like two weeks to go.

[02:24:17.540 --> 02:24:18.680]
13 days, it's a short month.

[02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:22.400]
And then like the projections would begin a march, and their actors show pretty much

[02:24:22.400 --> 02:24:26.640]
a similar pattern west to east, which doesn't allow the cold Arctic air to come zooming down.

[02:24:27.520 --> 02:24:28.200]
How do you like that?

[02:24:28.900 --> 02:24:31.220]
Too much just past pretty much on winter this year here.

[02:24:31.880 --> 02:24:32.440]
Lucky you?

[02:24:32.840 --> 02:24:34.700]
Yeah, lucky you have a single global warming aid all that.

[02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:35.740]
No, that's true.

[02:24:36.100 --> 02:24:39.000]
And plus by the time that everybody is drowning, I'll be dead anyway.

[02:24:39.760 --> 02:24:40.800]
Dominic Q.A. and hello.

[02:24:42.300 --> 02:24:42.700]
Hello.

[02:24:43.320 --> 02:24:43.900]
Yes, sir.

[02:24:44.100 --> 02:24:44.560]
Hey, Neil.

[02:24:44.760 --> 02:24:48.240]
I was calling in regards to that initiation thing you guys were going over?

[02:24:48.580 --> 02:24:48.780]
Yes.

[02:24:49.200 --> 02:24:54.640]
I mean, what will happen to all that old-fashioned, you know, beat somebody over whatever, you know,

[02:24:54.680 --> 02:24:55.860]
that running around naked stuff?

[02:24:56.240 --> 02:24:57.560]
Yeah, that's for pansies, man.

[02:24:57.660 --> 02:24:58.060]
Yeah, that is.

[02:24:58.200 --> 02:24:59.040]
That's like gay stuff.

[02:24:59.040 --> 02:25:03.060]
The actual thing is to beat the crap out of these guys and make them bleed and stuff like that.

[02:25:03.360 --> 02:25:04.320]
Exactly, exactly.

[02:25:04.740 --> 02:25:04.740]

[02:25:04.740 --> 02:25:06.360]
Maybe break a couple of bones or something.

[02:25:06.360 --> 02:25:08.060]
Put them in a cache or a couple of bones, man.

[02:25:08.060 --> 02:25:08.940]
I'm not expecting that.

[02:25:08.960 --> 02:25:11.120]
Yeah, tied them to the football post or something and beat them up.

[02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:11.520]
There you go.

[02:25:12.380 --> 02:25:12.940]
That's it.

[02:25:12.960 --> 02:25:14.040]
Until they bleed to death.

[02:25:14.040 --> 02:25:17.440]
And from the uprights until their brain turns to jello, you got it.

[02:25:17.460 --> 02:25:17.840]
Exactly.

[02:25:18.080 --> 02:25:21.460]
Without that running around with underwear on the face.

[02:25:21.700 --> 02:25:22.140]
Yeah, man.

[02:25:22.320 --> 02:25:22.840]
Without underwear.

[02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:23.080]
Yeah.

[02:25:23.680 --> 02:25:24.480]
Exactly, exactly.

[02:25:24.480 --> 02:25:25.080]
That's fooling me.

[02:25:25.240 --> 02:25:26.680]
You're not fooling a hoolioc human.

[02:25:27.040 --> 02:25:27.440]
Never.

[02:25:27.960 --> 02:25:28.580]
All right, Neil.

[02:25:28.720 --> 02:25:29.220]
I'll go with it.

[02:25:29.300 --> 02:25:29.860]
Ask the K-A.

[02:25:32.300 --> 02:25:32.700]
56670560.

[02:25:33.500 --> 02:25:34.620]
They're not fooling him.

[02:25:34.620 --> 02:25:36.440]
And he ain't fooling us all about it.

[02:25:36.440 --> 02:25:37.500]
Nobody QAM, hello.

[02:25:38.220 --> 02:25:39.040]
Hey, Neil.

[02:25:39.480 --> 02:25:41.700]
That guy was too much.

[02:25:41.800 --> 02:25:42.560]
That you let him out.

[02:25:42.560 --> 02:25:43.040]
He was.

[02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:43.620]
He was.

[02:25:44.120 --> 02:25:45.040]
Who's radio?

[02:25:45.400 --> 02:25:46.180]
That was great radio.

[02:25:46.320 --> 02:25:46.940]
It was almost like radio.

[02:25:47.680 --> 02:25:47.820]
That was.

[02:25:48.440 --> 02:25:52.200]
Why is he going to kill K-A and all the other G-A.

[02:25:52.480 --> 02:25:54.040]
No, no, no, no, no.

[02:25:55.960 --> 02:25:59.980]
Joverization with the left bank and keys on the scat rig and showed tonight recorded backstage.

[02:26:00.160 --> 02:26:01.240]
Too much scat rigging.

[02:26:01.520 --> 02:26:02.360]
Where's Dick Burton?

[02:26:03.400 --> 02:26:03.880]
He's got a great, fantastic music.

[02:26:04.540 --> 02:26:04.540]

[02:26:07.080 --> 02:26:08.420]
Look at it.

[02:26:08.420 --> 02:26:09.360]
The scat rigging is fair.

[02:26:09.500 --> 02:26:11.200]
It's 7-0-4, D-B-D-K and I signed.

[02:26:11.380 --> 02:26:14.680]
I look cold for you tonight, along with the music and things of my gold.

[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:15.360]
Yeah, good.

[02:26:15.720 --> 02:26:17.960]
Is there anybody else on here who said freaking scat rigging our room?

[02:26:18.680 --> 02:26:19.040]
What's this?

[02:26:20.920 --> 02:26:23.260]
Oh, it's only for me.

[02:26:23.580 --> 02:26:27.580]
It's a bottom button leading to our shadows.

[02:26:29.240 --> 02:26:35.660]
Ladies and gentlemen, you're the thing about some of gold weekend.

[02:26:35.900 --> 02:26:39.260]
C-K-A-W-M-O-D-C.

[02:26:39.640 --> 02:26:40.060]
Oh, right.

[02:26:40.140 --> 02:26:41.100]
Kind of clock at a big eight.

[02:26:41.920 --> 02:26:42.980]
It's got a rigging I go to every day.

[02:26:42.980 --> 02:26:43.760]
More scat rigging.

[02:26:44.020 --> 02:26:45.340]
It's got a special scat rigging.

[02:26:47.520 --> 02:26:48.560]
Where's Jim Jeffries?

[02:26:48.560 --> 02:26:49.920]
How much now?

[02:26:50.920 --> 02:26:53.260]
Somebody will find a no-how.

[02:26:54.040 --> 02:26:56.740]
He's got a hard one after school.

[02:26:58.360 --> 02:27:02.520]
Somebody will find a no-how.

[02:27:03.660 --> 02:27:04.060]
Exactly.

[02:27:05.100 --> 02:27:06.720]
Where's Rodney the Rodney and J. Michael Wilson?

[02:27:06.860 --> 02:27:08.420]
Where's all the really great DJs?

[02:27:08.500 --> 02:27:09.820]
What's his name?

[02:27:10.020 --> 02:27:10.480]
What's his name?

[02:27:11.740 --> 02:27:13.440]
I don't know if you'd like to thank Chuck again.

[02:27:13.600 --> 02:27:14.500]
This is a pretty outlier.

[02:27:14.700 --> 02:27:16.420]
And of course, the quality of the two is pretty.

[02:27:16.860 --> 02:27:18.700]
I probably didn't point it out right off the radio.

[02:27:19.560 --> 02:27:21.280]
No, it didn't sound like he recorded it on the audio.

[02:27:21.460 --> 02:27:21.620]
It does.

[02:27:21.760 --> 02:27:23.180]
It sounds like he recorded it through a strainer.

[02:27:23.600 --> 02:27:24.560]
Sounds kind of like the QA M.

[02:27:24.640 --> 02:27:25.140]
So you can hold on.

[02:27:25.380 --> 02:27:25.580]
I'm going to mention it.

[02:27:26.620 --> 02:27:28.300]
I remember what I used to be in radio.

[02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:35.600]
This is Neil Rogers, introducing the QA M box office presented by Burger King.

[02:27:36.600 --> 02:27:37.720]
This is G.A.L.S.A.

[02:27:38.960 --> 02:27:44.240]
Every Tuesday, the QA M box office will open for your chance to win tickets to upcoming South Florida bands.

[02:27:44.240 --> 02:27:48.540]
Thank God the QA M box office on Sport Radio 560.

[02:27:48.560 --> 02:27:49.500]
It was a baby.

[02:27:49.620 --> 02:27:50.240]
QA M.

[02:27:50.880 --> 02:27:51.320]
Neil?

[02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:52.400]
God?

[02:27:54.720 --> 02:27:55.560]
Absolutely.

[02:28:05.440 --> 02:28:07.120]
Anybody here?

[02:28:08.020 --> 02:28:10.100]
Sing your favorite song.

[02:28:10.100 --> 02:28:16.660]
Here is our ancient student for Daran.

[02:28:17.220 --> 02:28:22.940]
He's through a lot of people, but he sometimes get caught.

[02:28:24.320 --> 02:28:27.620]
I've got it for writing Neil Khan.

[02:28:37.080 --> 02:28:39.640]
Anybody here?

[02:28:39.920 --> 02:28:42.480]
Sing good, fresh and dark.

[02:28:43.240 --> 02:28:47.780]
The people around their town.

[02:28:49.420 --> 02:28:55.480]
He's not just thinking they should be for his Daran.

[02:28:55.480 --> 02:28:59.920]
He's been a shower with his son.

[02:29:03.040 --> 02:29:09.700]
He first advised us what the White House is capable of.

[02:29:09.700 --> 02:29:16.920]
For it is Christian to know what's best for you and me.

[02:29:18.620 --> 02:29:20.980]
Averamon, that's great.

[02:29:22.040 --> 02:29:25.380]
He was in some people.

[02:29:26.640 --> 02:29:31.540]
In the word duty anybody here.

[02:29:31.980 --> 02:29:34.440]
Please say to Tom Delaney,

[02:29:35.800 --> 02:29:40.680]
Gordish Delphin, Cocktail Hoist.

[02:29:41.120 --> 02:29:41.580]
You heard?

[02:29:42.160 --> 02:29:46.840]
These kind of signs have been gone and can't be why.

[02:29:49.240 --> 02:29:51.600]
Averamon, doubt him and Tom.

[02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:56.780]
I'm looking and I'm trying to find job here.

[02:29:56.900 --> 02:29:58.040]
You put a nice convenient link.

[02:29:58.140 --> 02:30:00.300]
You just click it there and you go right to the raw story.

[02:30:03.920 --> 02:30:07.700]
However, I'll notice that whoever put these in here,

[02:30:07.820 --> 02:30:10.480]
or whoever released them.

[02:30:10.700 --> 02:30:13.140]
Because you really don't know where they originally put in the blackouts.

[02:30:14.760 --> 02:30:16.720]
They were looking too carefully.

[02:30:16.980 --> 02:30:18.340]
The second picture from the bottom.

[02:30:19.360 --> 02:30:21.380]
Were they having a pile of arachies there?

[02:30:24.100 --> 02:30:26.140]
I could be just my imagination.

[02:30:26.980 --> 02:30:28.120]
I'm not looking to see that.

[02:30:28.260 --> 02:30:32.180]
It looks to me like there are a couple of digits.

[02:30:33.400 --> 02:30:33.860]
See what I'm saying?

[02:30:36.200 --> 02:30:38.000]
You don't have to look too closely.

[02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:39.120]
I think it will pop right on.

[02:30:39.260 --> 02:30:43.740]
A couple of things that they missed.

[02:30:44.380 --> 02:30:46.860]
Those are feet.

[02:30:48.900 --> 02:30:49.060]
No.

[02:30:49.860 --> 02:30:52.280]
No, two of them are feet, but the one on the bottom middle.

[02:30:52.860 --> 02:30:53.480]
That ain't a foot.

[02:30:53.920 --> 02:30:56.680]
That might be 12 inches, but it ain't a foot.

[02:30:58.260 --> 02:30:59.060]
That's my point.

[02:31:00.820 --> 02:31:01.620]
Anyway, there you go.

[02:31:01.940 --> 02:31:04.380]
That will probably stimulate a lot of these closet queens.

[02:31:04.820 --> 02:31:06.500]
There's some crap guys can get.

[02:31:06.640 --> 02:31:09.540]
Maybe all that guy was running naked on the beach with his buddies there.

[02:31:09.820 --> 02:31:11.340]
The whole fraternity is probably checking those pictures.

[02:31:11.380 --> 02:31:12.060]
Maybe that's all this is.

[02:31:12.280 --> 02:31:14.240]
That could be it.

[02:31:14.340 --> 02:31:14.820]
There you go.

[02:31:15.660 --> 02:31:17.340]
If they want to get to micro-c,

[02:31:17.620 --> 02:31:20.960]
they can get old.

[02:31:21.100 --> 02:31:24.600]
They can join the elves and the American Legion and the BFW.

[02:31:25.200 --> 02:31:27.420]
They can go drink a lot of booze and play cards.

[02:31:28.580 --> 02:31:29.360]
Sit around with them.

[02:31:29.680 --> 02:31:30.780]
Silly has hats on.

[02:31:30.960 --> 02:31:31.900]
That's just a wonderful thing.

[02:31:34.180 --> 02:31:34.660]
56670560,

[02:31:34.900 --> 02:31:36.260]
Palm 560 and leave a ride.

[02:31:36.540 --> 02:31:38.700]
I'm starting to wonder who the real barbarians are.

[02:31:39.680 --> 02:31:41.200]
They never killed any of us.

[02:31:41.860 --> 02:31:43.120]
They never killed nobody.

[02:31:43.440 --> 02:31:46.180]
They never took any American right.

[02:31:46.700 --> 02:31:47.880]
They did all these things.

[02:31:48.940 --> 02:31:49.840]
All of these things.

[02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:51.100]
Right.

[02:31:51.260 --> 02:31:51.880]
They just started to wonder.

[02:31:53.140 --> 02:31:53.880]
WDQYM, hello.

[02:31:54.680 --> 02:31:58.540]
Neil, did you see the picture of this broad chain he was with?

[02:31:59.480 --> 02:32:01.020]
Where do we find that?

[02:32:01.020 --> 02:32:03.380]
Huffington Post has it.

[02:32:03.480 --> 02:32:03.780]
Do they?

[02:32:04.200 --> 02:32:06.460]
I use the word broad advisedly.

[02:32:07.780 --> 02:32:09.760]
She looks like a tranny to me.

[02:32:10.820 --> 02:32:13.920]
Monica is ten times more doable than this broad.

[02:32:14.260 --> 02:32:14.480]
Wow.

[02:32:14.780 --> 02:32:15.520]
That says it all.

[02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:17.340]
I guess there were actually two.

[02:32:17.480 --> 02:32:19.480]
There's a couple of stories on the Huffington Post.

[02:32:20.440 --> 02:32:24.420]
I guess there were two women on this little excursion.

[02:32:25.620 --> 02:32:28.240]
But the one who was supposedly with Cheney at the time,

[02:32:28.240 --> 02:32:29.360]
the other one was the car.

[02:32:30.040 --> 02:32:30.780]
It was like something.

[02:32:30.780 --> 02:32:33.180]
I guess just stating by just in case she was needed, right?

[02:32:33.660 --> 02:32:33.780]
Yeah.

[02:32:33.840 --> 02:32:38.120]
We check out the picture and we'll talk before you eat lunch.

[02:32:38.460 --> 02:32:39.180]
I'm on it right now.

[02:32:39.300 --> 02:32:39.980]
Okay. Thanks, Pallee.

[02:32:40.280 --> 02:32:40.640]
All right, miss.

[02:32:41.460 --> 02:32:41.680]
Okay.

[02:32:41.840 --> 02:32:42.580]
tension slared.

[02:32:42.760 --> 02:32:43.080]
Winehouse.

[02:32:43.200 --> 02:32:44.840]
Over Cheney shooting the Huffington Post.

[02:32:44.940 --> 02:32:45.680]
There is a big headline.

[02:32:46.600 --> 02:32:46.980]
I'm looking.

[02:32:47.960 --> 02:32:48.420]
Let's see.

[02:32:48.520 --> 02:32:50.280]
Probably got a click on that story, wouldn't you think?

[02:32:51.220 --> 02:32:52.060]
I'm pretty good at that.

[02:32:52.060 --> 02:32:52.660]
I can't find it.

[02:32:52.880 --> 02:32:53.900]
But I'm looking.

[02:32:54.660 --> 02:32:56.980]
I'm looking for that picture.

[02:32:57.500 --> 02:33:00.520]
No, I don't see it. I see the article about the guy with a heart attack. That's

[02:33:00.520 --> 02:33:04.700]
yet. That's old news, man. That's yesterday's news. Let me take a puke at it.

[02:33:05.840 --> 02:33:08.740]
What happens is, don't you know if her father was being taken to the hospital a bit more?

[02:33:10.100 --> 02:33:19.340]
That's got to cute. But I mean, but I don't see it to you. No. We needed more information

[02:33:19.340 --> 02:33:22.600]
from that guy. Yeah, I don't see at all. Maybe it was yesterday on the Huffington Post.

[02:33:24.240 --> 02:33:28.980]
Anyway, I'm sure inquiry minds out there will scour and come up. Come up with a picture of this

[02:33:28.980 --> 02:33:34.000]
a bitch. I mean, this fine lady. So that it kind of sounds like elements

[02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:37.940]
that you have to quit it all over again, you know. I mean, what would be the other reason why they want to

[02:33:37.940 --> 02:33:42.180]
cover it up? I mean, it's embarrassing, but don't bring your business nosey. Why do you hate America?

[02:33:42.600 --> 02:33:46.600]
Right. It's an accident, but nevertheless, if he's there with some broad that's not his wife on

[02:33:46.720 --> 02:33:51.520]
his hunting trips, which is probably most likely. You know, it's like Prince Philip in England,

[02:33:52.240 --> 02:33:55.500]
who's got some bimbo in every port. So they say, and then he want to come back to England.

[02:33:55.620 --> 02:33:59.860]
The Queen can't get about his bed. He's just a hornial coot. Hornial Nazi, I guess.

[02:34:00.840 --> 02:34:04.660]
5, 6, 7. Oh, I guess I don't know. He's not really one of them. Is he?

[02:34:06.340 --> 02:34:10.640]
Not that we really care about them. He's not. No. He's not one of the Batonburgs.

[02:34:11.360 --> 02:34:18.120]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Pop ward is another scandal brewing man. He's a big scandal coming with your vice president.

[02:34:18.700 --> 02:34:21.420]
And it's been a, there may be some shooting going on, but wasn't just with the gun.

[02:34:23.520 --> 02:34:27.680]
WDQ, why am I? Hello? Yeah, good afternoon, Uncle Neil. Yes, sir.

[02:34:28.080 --> 02:34:34.520]
I got, I got one for today's board, but I have to move over to you don't support it. I said, what about a guy who was a man crush?

[02:34:34.720 --> 02:34:39.260]
You know, like a man dog on Kirby's always talk about man crush? Yeah, I like Tom Brady, young.

[02:34:39.260 --> 02:34:45.840]
You're right. Our guy who was born. Our guy was clear and near polish.

[02:34:46.760 --> 02:34:52.140]
And I'm about a phone call earlier. I'm glad that phone call is made because I know my son is listening.

[02:34:52.320 --> 02:34:58.720]
I'm son. If you ever come home and send me you are going in a fraternity, I'm going to kick your ass.

[02:34:59.600 --> 02:35:05.060]
Excellent. Good job, pal. Okay. Okay. You got to send him bird hunting bird doggan.

[02:35:06.780 --> 02:35:12.000]
5670560, pond 560 and a Verizon singular wireless line. WDQ, why am hello?

[02:35:12.720 --> 02:35:18.280]
Who knew how you doing? Okay. Listen, I know I've come to the conclusion that we absolutely don't want.

[02:35:18.680 --> 02:35:25.720]
We can't handle the truth. When I see the way the story is being spun, I mean it's obvious that people, they want a fairy tale.

[02:35:25.900 --> 02:35:31.140]
I mean, if you had jokers off with the chini of first to shoot somebody and nobody would care, we'd allow for you.

[02:35:31.140 --> 02:35:39.460]
It's true. Nobody cares. And then they said that this trouble for the guy's heart and gave him a mild heart attack.

[02:35:39.640 --> 02:35:46.580]
I think Arlen, wait a minute. I think Arlen Spector is working on a deal where he's been at the same magic bullet that went through Kennedy and John Conley in 63.

[02:35:47.300 --> 02:35:54.820]
I think the bullet that Kennedy traveled to his brain. It was in Texas. You know, it's unbelievable.

[02:35:55.240 --> 02:35:58.360]
I think they're all drunk and having a Yahoo World tournament. They're trying to suffer.

[02:35:58.360 --> 02:36:03.060]
Are you mad? You got. And peach their ass right now. Okay. That's what I say.

[02:36:04.420 --> 02:36:08.060]
Although it looks to me like in soldiers over there, they have just a really gay old time.

[02:36:09.260 --> 02:36:16.500]
Yeah, well, those are. You look at that stuff and it's just so sick and I just can't imagine why the world hates America like you always do.

[02:36:16.880 --> 02:36:21.540]
And you just just boggling my mind. I'm going to imagine how straight people would concoct such scenarios.

[02:36:22.500 --> 02:36:29.160]
I see. And of course in the military is that don't ask don't tell. I guess not too many people are asking no more. Well, they don't have the question.

[02:36:29.360 --> 02:36:36.460]
Is your girlfriend there? Lindy Lindy Lindy England? How should you do it? She looks awfully much to me. I guess she was just doing everybody.

[02:36:36.640 --> 02:36:40.700]
You know, she can like equal opportunity sluts. She was spreading it around. Did she have a baby yet?

[02:36:41.180 --> 02:36:45.420]
Kind of spreading it around like we used to have in certain parts of our building there. You know what I mean?

[02:36:47.100 --> 02:36:54.920]
26 after one at QAM. This is Neil Rogers. This is 516.

[02:36:57.240 --> 02:36:58.620]
Absolutely want to put.

[02:37:00.880 --> 02:37:08.760]
Yeah, this is already pulling it here a little more on it. It is broadcast in the live from the Olympics here in the Torino.

[02:37:08.760 --> 02:37:24.520]
On the wide world of the Dolores turning me hit the elisper radius. I'll break it. Yes. I'll be interjecting a delightful mixture of humorous comments and music.

[02:37:24.800 --> 02:37:30.900]
Yeah, I can ask that finalists are at lightning up for the duty duration competition.

[02:37:30.900 --> 02:37:35.880]
When it gets done, boys, can wash his hands and wins a medal pretty exciting stuff over here.

[02:37:36.300 --> 02:37:41.900]
Torino and I once had a Ford Torino.

[02:37:44.060 --> 02:37:44.740]
Yeah.

[02:37:49.180 --> 02:37:58.820]
That's that. And Portley fellow is out already. Yes. I stand before you now and give that guy a number two.

[02:37:58.820 --> 02:38:07.080]
Or is it that you sit down for number one? I could never even pop. Now we go from the loop to the loop.

[02:38:07.780 --> 02:38:15.520]
Yeah, you get it. It's a clue. And what we have here from the lift to the right of your video screen is a bunch of men.

[02:38:15.700 --> 02:38:22.900]
It's like not the snow on top of each other. Yeah, it's how unexciting this is to why not like my show.

[02:38:22.900 --> 02:38:26.860]
Oh, what do you mean? This is having exciting.

[02:38:27.540 --> 02:38:35.480]
God, fine. I'm getting a check for this. As I said, this is so exciting. I think we should join in.

[02:38:35.900 --> 02:38:36.320]
Shall we?

[02:38:36.480 --> 02:38:38.820]
What is this? No one's talking about something like this?

[02:38:38.820 --> 02:38:39.320]
Yeah.

[02:38:44.820 --> 02:38:46.100]
Here drops the curve.

[02:38:47.960 --> 02:38:53.820]
Oh, I thought I was wearing the first.

[02:38:55.860 --> 02:38:59.320]
I'm flying.

[02:38:59.320 --> 02:38:59.320]

[02:39:06.140 --> 02:39:06.640]
132.

[02:39:06.760 --> 02:39:07.240]
132.

[02:39:07.420 --> 02:39:07.420]

[02:39:07.660 --> 02:39:07.660]

[02:39:28.800 --> 02:39:29.300]
132.

[02:39:29.300 --> 02:39:31.660]
I'm looking on you again. Okay. Kind of a coward too.

[02:39:33.180 --> 02:39:35.980]
Spineless yellow coward. Kind of fits right in there with the yellow.

[02:39:37.540 --> 02:39:41.360]
So there's a picture of this guy. I mean woman. Oh, it just wait. Good.

[02:39:41.920 --> 02:39:44.080]
One other was I got to see it. I could do it in the break. I guess.

[02:39:44.760 --> 02:39:47.260]
Well, this is a very important thing, man. See the little town.

[02:39:47.340 --> 02:39:48.480]
Go look. I just wanted to get that out there.

[02:39:50.280 --> 02:39:51.280]
Golden Township, Michigan.

[02:39:52.380 --> 02:39:53.760]
You better watch it, mister.

[02:39:55.220 --> 02:39:57.620]
A man with shot an injured one is hunting partner. Mr.

[02:39:57.700 --> 02:39:59.740]
His elbow for a squirrel authority said.

[02:40:00.480 --> 02:40:04.080]
You see he's picking on a four vice president. There's a lot of people out there with that eyesight.

[02:40:05.360 --> 02:40:07.660]
Michigan State Police said George Arthur Sikanga.

[02:40:08.120 --> 02:40:15.520]
Not Heisinga. Sikanga, 64 of Muskegon, was wounded Sunday morning in Golden Township in Michigan's west central lower Penicilla.

[02:40:16.520 --> 02:40:20.760]
Sikanga was wearing camouflage clothing, sifre and orange hat, which he had covered with a hood.

[02:40:20.760 --> 02:40:23.440]
After sitting down behind a tree, the Muskegon Chronicle says,

[02:40:23.840 --> 02:40:29.160]
his clothe elbow was all that was visible of him when his friend Gregory Scott Wood approached from behind the tree.

[02:40:29.460 --> 02:40:31.600]
He saw that orange stand by the bed. There you go.

[02:40:32.400 --> 02:40:36.680]
And fired his weapon with the letting's and daily news described as a 17 caliber rifle.

[02:40:37.840 --> 02:40:40.760]
Sikanga was transported to a local hospital where his treated and released.

[02:40:41.080 --> 02:40:42.220]
Police are investigating the shooting.

[02:40:43.960 --> 02:40:44.740]
You're like that.

[02:40:46.480 --> 02:40:49.620]
Alright. His left elbow was sticking out.

[02:40:50.120 --> 02:40:50.760]
17 caliber.

[02:40:52.420 --> 02:40:52.660]
Yeah.

[02:40:56.420 --> 02:40:59.260]
Say I want to say more, a lot of people look at them pictures on a website.

[02:40:59.860 --> 02:41:01.160]
I could barely get on that damn thing.

[02:41:02.160 --> 02:41:04.460]
So in other words, you emailed me that thing.

[02:41:04.540 --> 02:41:06.740]
You didn't want to fax me. The picture would probably be as good as that.

[02:41:06.760 --> 02:41:08.420]
Well, no, it wouldn't. It's a color picture. It's a very nice thing.

[02:41:08.420 --> 02:41:10.500]
Oh, it's in full color. No, it's just a...

[02:41:10.500 --> 02:41:11.760]
Open up the link and...

[02:41:12.660 --> 02:41:13.520]
I'll open it up.

[02:41:13.820 --> 02:41:13.820]

[02:41:13.820 --> 02:41:13.820]

[02:41:13.820 --> 02:41:13.820]

[02:41:15.400 --> 02:41:17.300]
Army accepts crime and recruits.

[02:41:18.840 --> 02:41:22.500]
Ready for this? That's how desperate they are to find anybody stupid enough to win this right now.

[02:41:23.920 --> 02:41:25.740]
Somebody who's like suicidal would be good.

[02:41:25.880 --> 02:41:26.000]
Sure.

[02:41:26.580 --> 02:41:28.280]
Struggling to boots and trance in wartime.

[02:41:28.360 --> 02:41:31.360]
The army has sharply increased the number of recruits who would normally be barred

[02:41:31.360 --> 02:41:34.580]
because of criminal misconduct or booze and legal drug problems.

[02:41:35.020 --> 02:41:39.480]
Once again, raising concerns that the army is lowering its standards to make its recruiting goals.

[02:41:39.480 --> 02:41:41.040]
This is in the Baltimore Sun.

[02:41:41.140 --> 02:41:42.960]
A lot of them proved the situation in the prisons over there.

[02:41:43.280 --> 02:41:43.460]
Right.

[02:41:44.280 --> 02:41:46.360]
Oh, yeah, they should have a really good time over there now.

[02:41:47.480 --> 02:41:50.460]
Last year, almost one in six army recruits had a problem in their background.

[02:41:50.820 --> 02:41:53.780]
They would have disqualified them for military service in order to accept them.

[02:41:54.100 --> 02:41:57.320]
The army granted specific exceptions known as recruiting waivers.

[02:41:58.220 --> 02:41:59.980]
Well, those are the people of the recruiting station.

[02:42:00.020 --> 02:42:02.460]
Everybody goes by the wave. Like with the limperist?

[02:42:03.280 --> 02:42:03.540]
Mm-hmm.

[02:42:04.340 --> 02:42:07.920]
Recruits with medical problems made up to the largest single category of those given waivers.

[02:42:07.920 --> 02:42:12.980]
However, the largest increase was among recruits with this to be either criminal conduct or drug and booze problems

[02:42:12.980 --> 02:42:15.280]
according to that are provided by the army.

[02:42:17.020 --> 02:42:17.880]
They like that.

[02:42:19.420 --> 02:42:22.900]
Despite the increase in the proportion of those accepted with problems in their background,

[02:42:22.900 --> 02:42:26.840]
in spite of all that, the army still failed to meet its recruiting target.

[02:42:29.020 --> 02:42:31.540]
74,000 recruits short last year.

[02:42:31.940 --> 02:42:32.640]
Well, there you go, Jai.

[02:42:32.640 --> 02:42:36.600]
Instead of worrying about Bob from Muthin, this one and that one all the other, you know,

[02:42:36.660 --> 02:42:37.960]
interesting stuff going on there.

[02:42:38.500 --> 02:42:41.200]
Now go on down and sign up, baby.

[02:42:42.060 --> 02:42:43.080]
That'll work really hard.

[02:42:43.400 --> 02:42:45.260]
In fact, you could be right up there on top of that pile.

[02:42:47.660 --> 02:42:49.040]
Maybe you'll go up to that pit.

[02:42:49.420 --> 02:42:50.760]
Maybe Dufford likes to volunteer.

[02:42:51.440 --> 02:42:53.100]
Look kind of like right up his alley to me.

[02:42:55.760 --> 02:42:59.440]
56670560, pound 560 on the Verizon and Singular Wireless Line.

[02:42:59.900 --> 02:43:00.560]
What a hoot.

[02:43:00.560 --> 02:43:02.060]
How many QIMs?

[02:43:02.200 --> 02:43:02.200]

[02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:04.480]
Yes, sir.

[02:43:04.900 --> 02:43:05.580]
Is this QIM?

[02:43:06.320 --> 02:43:07.060]
This is us.

[02:43:08.500 --> 02:43:11.360]
You guys, I just wanted to make a comment to Neil.

[02:43:11.880 --> 02:43:12.920]
Go right ahead, you're speaking to him.

[02:43:13.540 --> 02:43:14.880]
Oh, hey, yeah.

[02:43:15.220 --> 02:43:18.880]
Did anybody notice that that collar sounded a little bit like I were a winderman?

[02:43:21.040 --> 02:43:22.500]
Now they imagine it.

[02:43:22.500 --> 02:43:24.800]
And you notice we don't hear Iron no more.

[02:43:24.940 --> 02:43:26.120]
We got Pat Roddy in his place.

[02:43:27.040 --> 02:43:31.180]
And don't you think that the windman would love to run naked on the beach with Miami Heat?

[02:43:31.700 --> 02:43:33.800]
It wouldn't surprise me, especially with, yeah.

[02:43:34.440 --> 02:43:35.520]
Just just a comment.

[02:43:35.920 --> 02:43:38.740]
I heard that Iron's favorite song was hanged on your head Tom Dooley.

[02:43:39.640 --> 02:43:40.880]
I could be wrong about that.

[02:43:41.600 --> 02:43:44.020]
Yeah, that one picture, boy, they sure missed something pretty obvious.

[02:43:44.020 --> 02:43:45.840]
I mean, it kind of like popped right out front of me.

[02:43:45.960 --> 02:43:46.660]
You know, I looked at it.

[02:43:47.260 --> 02:43:48.360]
Even you noticed it.

[02:43:48.580 --> 02:43:48.800]
Uh-huh.

[02:43:49.340 --> 02:43:50.220]
I mean, I'm a luster guy.

[02:43:50.320 --> 02:43:51.820]
Now it's possible that guy's got three feet.

[02:43:53.300 --> 02:43:54.780]
It's possible, but not likely.

[02:43:54.780 --> 02:43:57.320]
Although I looked at it a couple of times, it only looks like one foot to me.

[02:43:57.660 --> 02:43:57.660]

[02:43:57.920 --> 02:43:59.480]
Actually, okay.

[02:43:59.660 --> 02:44:00.080]
Half a foot.

[02:44:00.220 --> 02:44:00.780]
Calm down.

[02:44:01.380 --> 02:44:02.100]
Restrain yourself.

[02:44:03.280 --> 02:44:03.780]
It's hard.

[02:44:04.280 --> 02:44:04.480]
Yeah.

[02:44:05.700 --> 02:44:07.380]
If he was tap messing with me.

[02:44:09.140 --> 02:44:12.160]
What is the gaiest thing is so called straight guy can do.

[02:44:12.920 --> 02:44:13.600]
We got how many votes?

[02:44:13.620 --> 02:44:14.220]
A lot of votes.

[02:44:15.600 --> 02:44:18.960]
1300 and almost 1400 during the show, baby.

[02:44:19.400 --> 02:44:20.560]
And not that we didn't have a head start.

[02:44:21.060 --> 02:44:22.700]
I think we're going to have a head start with a cartoon.

[02:44:22.700 --> 02:44:25.660]
Sarah's probably working feverishly on it with three pages of stuff.

[02:44:25.780 --> 02:44:26.240]
I've asked him.

[02:44:26.360 --> 02:44:27.940]
He's probably not too happy with me.

[02:44:28.360 --> 02:44:28.720]
Cartoon.

[02:44:29.440 --> 02:44:29.880]
What?

[02:44:30.200 --> 02:44:30.820]

[02:53:41.640 --> 02:53:41.640]

[02:53:41.640 --> 02:53:41.640]

[02:53:41.640 --> 02:53:41.640]

[02:53:41.640 --> 02:53:41.640]

[02:53:44.760 --> 02:53:44.760]

[02:53:44.760 --> 02:53:44.760]

[02:53:45.380 --> 02:53:46.040]
I don't see you liking that movie.

[02:53:46.100 --> 02:53:46.780]

I haven't seen it.

[02:54:26.400 --> 02:54:26.460]
I haven't seen it.

[02:54:26.460 --> 02:54:26.460]

[02:54:26.460 --> 02:54:26.460]

[02:54:26.460 --> 02:54:26.460]

[02:54:26.460 --> 02:54:26.480]
I haven't seen it.

[02:54:26.480 --> 02:54:26.480]

[02:54:26.480 --> 02:54:26.480]

[02:54:26.480 --> 02:54:26.480]

[02:54:26.480 --> 02:54:26.480]

[02:54:26.480 --> 02:54:26.480]

[02:54:26.480 --> 02:54:26.480]

I haven't seen it.

[02:54:45.760 --> 02:54:45.760]

[02:54:45.760 --> 02:54:45.760]

[02:54:45.760 --> 02:54:45.760]

[02:54:45.760 --> 02:54:45.760]

[02:54:45.760 --> 02:54:45.760]

[02:54:45.760 --> 02:54:45.760]

[02:54:45.760 --> 02:54:45.900]
I haven't seen it.

[02:54:45.900 --> 02:54:45.900]

[02:54:45.900 --> 02:54:46.480]
I haven't seen it.

[02:54:46.640 --> 02:54:47.500]
I haven't seen it.

[02:54:47.500 --> 02:54:48.140]
I haven't seen it.

[02:54:48.620 --> 02:54:49.320]
I haven't seen it.

[02:54:49.320 --> 02:54:49.860]
I haven't seen it.

[02:54:49.860 --> 02:54:50.700]
I haven't seen it.

[02:54:51.120 --> 02:54:52.140]
I haven't seen it.

[02:54:52.460 --> 02:54:53.600]
I haven't seen it.

[02:54:54.820 --> 02:54:55.940]
I haven't seen it.

[02:54:55.940 --> 02:54:56.580]
I haven't seen it.

[02:54:57.060 --> 02:54:59.640]
I haven't seen it.

[02:54:59.800 --> 02:55:01.720]
I haven't seen it.

[02:55:01.820 --> 02:55:03.260]
I haven't seen it.

[02:55:03.260 --> 02:55:07.320]
I haven't seen it.

[02:55:07.320 --> 02:55:07.960]
I haven't seen it.

[02:55:07.960 --> 02:55:09.200]
I haven't seen it.

[02:55:09.200 --> 02:55:10.800]
I haven't seen it.

[02:55:16.940 --> 02:55:22.200]
A fighting soldier told a lie.

[02:55:23.080 --> 02:55:27.940]
A never been between his thighs.

[02:55:29.080 --> 02:55:33.540]
I don't care what he might claim.

[02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:38.900]
I've never done a great variety.

[02:55:40.360 --> 02:55:44.860]
I hate to sound so cliche.

[02:55:45.880 --> 02:55:51.180]
I've never gone the back door way.

[02:55:51.800 --> 02:55:57.180]
Let me say men are good by faith.

[02:55:57.580 --> 02:56:02.660]
But I've never done a grimble ray.

[02:56:03.400 --> 02:56:04.260]
You've ferret.

[02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:08.680]
Yes, Clay, Ike and to I have.

[02:56:09.680 --> 02:56:14.860]
And I've never touched a military man town.

[02:56:15.320 --> 02:56:20.240]
Though I've used my trouser snake.

[02:56:21.120 --> 02:56:25.880]
I've never done a grimble ray.

[02:56:26.880 --> 02:56:31.960]
I swear I've never done a grimble ray.

[02:56:33.200 --> 02:56:33.680]
All right.

[02:56:34.240 --> 02:56:35.680]
Don't worry about green tomorrow, by the way.

[02:56:36.500 --> 02:56:37.040]
But, good idea.

[02:56:37.040 --> 02:56:40.600]
So, RJ Escal writes that you see this story and having them post-beacon plan?

[02:56:41.180 --> 02:56:41.680]
Which one?

[02:56:41.820 --> 02:56:42.140]
I read a copy.

[02:56:42.140 --> 02:56:43.920]
Can you check the real story emerges?

[02:56:44.360 --> 02:56:45.140]
I was looking at it.

[02:56:45.220 --> 02:56:45.260]
Yeah.

[02:56:45.480 --> 02:56:46.860]
The real story is emerging already.

[02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.560]
If you wanted to do a little digging, can you and winning ten went hunting with two women?

[02:56:49.560 --> 02:56:50.220]
Not their wives.

[02:56:50.220 --> 02:56:52.140]
There was some drinking, winning ten wound up shot.

[02:56:52.760 --> 02:56:53.980]
I don't have time to read the whole thing.

[02:56:54.360 --> 02:56:55.480]
I already sent it along.

[02:56:56.700 --> 02:56:58.680]
At Kat's and armthong, she was the broad necar.

[02:56:58.900 --> 02:57:01.280]
She said she saw can you security detail right in toward the scene.

[02:57:01.620 --> 02:57:05.640]
The first thing we crossed, my mind was she had a heart problem, she told the AP, meaning a can you of course.

[02:57:06.040 --> 02:57:07.620]
In other words, she didn't see the accident.

[02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:10.980]
Oliver statements were complete with colorful side bars about getting peppered pretty good.

[02:57:11.160 --> 02:57:13.420]
He had the false impression she was in eyewitness, she was not.

[02:57:13.980 --> 02:57:17.620]
And Dr. David Blanchard, who made the light of Woodington's injuries, come to find out.

[02:57:17.740 --> 02:57:22.160]
He's a vice chairperson of World Hope International, like Christian Evangelical Aid Group.

[02:57:23.740 --> 02:57:25.700]
So, Cheney was drinking, was Cheney drinking?

[02:57:25.900 --> 02:57:27.600]
Was there anything inappropriate about the hunting parties?

[02:57:28.020 --> 02:57:29.300]
A lot of good stuff in here, okay?

[02:57:29.900 --> 02:57:31.800]
Then, then, then, as the beat goes on.

[02:57:32.140 --> 02:57:34.540]
Nobody's coming up next to, scratch yourselves in.

[02:57:34.540 --> 02:57:35.400]
Bye, bye, bye!
