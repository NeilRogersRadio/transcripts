[00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:01.140]
Hi!

[00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:03.440]
It's a good toy!

[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.280]
I'm here in the old man, I'll tell you that. I finally figured out how you tell when you get old.

[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.860]
I have a lot of ways.

[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.420]
No, no, I got one way, the best.

[00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.400]
I'm experienced yesterday. It was freezing rain yesterday.

[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.200]
Yesterday was one of the few nasty days we've had here in a long time.

[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.400]
It's all gone today, but freezing rain.

[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.420]
So, oh, I don't know about 430. I decided to go to the drugstore and pick up a few things.

[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.800]
How come I'm hearing that echo in the back?

[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.440]
Echo!

[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.360]
But anyway, so I go across the street and I realize that season is really slippery.

[00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.500]
Every step you take, you like, slip and slide a little bit. Plus it's windy.

[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.620]
So you're like ice skating with no skates.

[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.580]
So I go and I get my stuff and I got about 5-6 items in a bag and I come out of there.

[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.980]
And while I was in there for 5 minutes, I guess the temperature must have dropped like about, you know, a little bit.

[00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.180]
To the point where everything was just frozen solid, like a sheet of ice.

[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.900]
So I come out and I get almost to the curb and all of a sudden I realize I'm like ice skating.

[00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.020]
I'm moving, the wind is blowing me around and so I made a bad mistake.

[00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.120]
Instead of just getting my bearings, I grabbed onto a pole.

[00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.540]
There was a pole, like a bus at the bus time.

[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.420]
I grabbed the pole and the pole was like a sheet of ice too.

[00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.040]
So that caused me to slip a little bit and boom, I go down on my knee.

[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.260]
You know, not like a bad fall.

[00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.360]
I go down. So about 3-4 items out of my bag go flying on a sidewalk.

[00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.060]
Well, I stood up and then I realized to try to bend down to pick up the items,

[00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.360]
the wind is blowing me and I'm thinking if I actually reach down to pick those up, I'm going to go flop on my face again.

[00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.520]
So here comes a guy with say about 70, very nice man, tagging guy looking guy.

[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.080]
And he comes by and he picks up the items and he hands into me, I open the bag and I said,

[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.520]
do you think very much? And he reaches out, this is it.

[00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.200]
He reaches out his hand for me to grab onto.

[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.020]
I'm already standing up, keeping my hand.

[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.900]
That's like he's lifting me up for him to help me across the street.

[00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.760]
I said, oh no, that's okay, thanks very much.

[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.220]
And I thought to myself, wouldn't that be something to be helped across the street by a 70-year-old man?

[00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.340]
Yeah, and I thought to myself, man am I older or what?

[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.320]
Absolutely.

[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.020]
You know, that's not just an age thing. I was never good at nice and slow.

[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.980]
Well, you know, the other thing that didn't make me feel so bad is as I'm standing there,

[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.760]
and he's picking up the items, there's two kids, two teenagers, and they're about a half of a block away.

[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.180]
And they're like, oh, and you hear all the noise and you look and one of them went slipping on his ass,

[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.060]
and the other one was like sliding, you know, a slide like he was on skates, but he wasn't.

[00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.520]
I mean, it was, I never experienced anything like that.

[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.560]
That's why I always hated that weather.

[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.840]
When you had ice and snow, and you're out there trying to negotiate that walking.

[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.240]
Always good for a flop, you know.

[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.980]
I remember one time, only once in my life, I think, I ever did that on the ice,

[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.700]
and I was walking down the front steps of my house to go to high school,

[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.740]
to walk through school, my arms full of my books, and zip there I went down the stairs,

[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.140]
and there were books going to fly in all the directions.

[00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.960]
There was a long time ago, about a hundred years ago.

[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.220]
That's the only other time I remember slipping on the ice.

[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.880]
This was impossible.

[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.320]
I mean, I'm watching the people out there, and everybody's like skidding,

[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.960]
and I had good walking shoes, you know, new balanced good shoes, but I don't know.

[00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.000]
But it's all gone now.

[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.000]
So there was a real lesson in life for it.

[00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.360]
You don't want to be helped across the street by an old guy.

[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.460]
It's older than you are.

[00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.540]
A very nice man, but he's, I was just thinking if we had ice and snow,

[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.060]
Florida, can you imagine that happening there?

[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.760]
How about people driving there?

[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.160]
Somebody would have probably come by and picked up the items in rain like that.

[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.640]

[00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.480]
Hey, our driving is no fun in that view.

[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.520]
Yeah, icy road.

[00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.860]
Yeah, well that's true.

[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.640]
In fact, they have what they call, well, you probably remember black ice.

[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.200]
Yeah.

[00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.480]
You know, when you can't see it, you don't know that it's there, but especially on the bridges.

[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.180]
You know, on the bridges.

[00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.780]
Stuff freezes up and you can't see it, because you get just the right temperature when it's raining.

[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.900]
When it's like right between rain and snow.

[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.820]
And you can't do anything about it either.

[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.580]
And I remember one time when we were driving back from some ski place up in Vermont,

[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.400]
going back in the city when I lived in New York and there were four of us in the car.

[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.640]
And we hit that black ice patch.

[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.260]
Yeah.

[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.940]
And we started a skid and the guy driving said, well, here comes the accident.

[00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.740]
And we just were going to have an accident.

[00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.120]
There was no way to stop it.

[00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.540]
Yeah.

[00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:00.140]
And we did.

[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.780]
We wound up bumping into a part of a toll.

[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.180]
Skidded right into it.

[00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.380]
I'm going to another brief great story.

[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.640]
It's a miracle I'm still alive.

[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.240]
This is speaking of the racetrack.

[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.580]
Many, many years ago, I've been in Detroit.

[00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.000]
I'm working in Kalamazoo, which is 150 miles from Detroit.

[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.380]
But what's that when you're going to the track?

[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.160]
You know, I used to go like five, six nights a week.

[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.460]
Sure.

[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.000]
So 300 miles around the trip.

[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.320]
But in those days, the speed limit was 70 or 75.

[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.460]
You could go 90 easy.

[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.140]
So I'm driving on the Interstate I-94 from Kalamazoo Detroit.

[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.180]
And I'm about two thirds of it away there and it starts raining like hell.

[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.740]
And I'm going pretty damn fast too, because you got a hot day at the Hazel Park.

[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.540]
It's going to be a lot of fun.

[00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.680]
I'm going to get a flat tire right there in the highway.

[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.640]
Well, you're going that fast in the rain.

[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.440]
You did.

[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.660]
And so now I basically I gave up because now I totally lose control of the car.

[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.720]
And this is like about, oh, I don't know, six o'clock in the afternoon.

[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.420]
It's like what's going to be rush hour.

[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.680]
And so I actually let go of the steering wheel because I couldn't steer the car anymore.

[00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.420]
And I went across the highway to my left and then back across to the right without hitting anybody.

[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.020]
A miracle.

[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.340]
And then off the off the shorter of the road, there was like one of those metal.

[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.960]
I don't know what to do.

[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.820]
We call those things.

[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.680]
The things that the side of the road like a guardrail.

[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:13.760]
Yeah, very good.

[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:14.500]
Like a guardrail.

[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:15.140]
Excellent.

[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.320]
What is more on I am?

[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.840]
Well, I had that old age episode.

[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.740]
And the guardrail stopped.

[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.100]
Boom, I just stopped right there.

[00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.640]
So somebody just pulled up and stopped.

[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.800]
Some goods and Mary said, boy, I wish you could have seen that.

[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.660]
It was the scariest thing ever saw in my life.

[00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:28.740]
I said, well, I was in the car.

[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.360]
So I kind of relate to it.

[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.800]
Were you driving a sports car then?

[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.100]
No, I was driving a white cutlass.

[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.700]
Not a sports car.

[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.060]

[00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.980]
Well, to make a long story short, I still made it.

[00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.480]
I still, yeah, I got it towed to a nearby garage.

[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.800]
And I called and got a red car.

[00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.060]
And I, well, wasn't that far from the airport?

[00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.460]
You know, the pre-metry airport.

[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.420]
And I got a red car and I made it to the track for post-time.

[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.100]
Let's hear it.

[00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.440]
That's the real degenerate.

[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.740]
Okay.

[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.200]
Now since you brought it up, I think I'll go gamble today.

[00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.900]
Oh, no charges against waiting his wife.

[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.740]
Yeah, I saw those charges against waiting in Mrs. Wayne.

[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.640]
Well, isn't that sweet?

[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.460]
I still say that they gambled their brains out.

[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.500]
And probably illegal too.

[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.180]
I have nothing wrong with gambling, as you know.

[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.380]
I don't hold a grudge against people that plunge their guts up.

[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.340]
But nevertheless, it's just, you know, it's all for a crap.

[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.800]
I guess the gambling is not illegal.

[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.280]
It's taking the bet that is.

[00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:20.000]
I see.

[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.540]
The bookmaking part is illegal.

[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.400]
But you can't prosecute the bettors.

[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.920]
The bettors are called as witnesses.

[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.780]
And I'm going to call up Mokzie Solomon.

[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:28.880]
See how he's doing.

[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.260]
The dead for a long time.

[00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.520]
Yeah, check him out.

[00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.400]
Well, see, the problem with him was, he was a good guy and he'd give people credit.

[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.200]
You know, he's just an old saffy, you know.

[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.660]
And get, uh, wind up getting, holding the bag, as they say.

[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.080]
Kind of like, you know, somebody else we never, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.800]
He's to hold the bag.

[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.600]
We're at least clippin' on the side of the chair.

[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.220]
Somebody was telling me a story about how they were in, uh, Omaha,

[00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.240]
for the college world series, and sunny, uh,

[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.560]
asked them if they wanted to go to the races and, uh,

[00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.780]
it wasn't like Sarbin, it was someplace else.

[00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.960]
Or no, a tour casino was a casino.

[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:00.560]
Really?

[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.500]
And, uh, I want to go play a few hands of Blackjack.

[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.860]
He says it's not too far from here.

[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.920]
Who is 200 miles away.

[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:07.880]
Of course.

[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.380]
The good drive and the drive, where is this place?

[00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:11.440]
No problem, I'm sure.

[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.300]
For a few hands of Blackjack.

[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.000]
Yeah, no problem.

[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.600]
That's a real degenerate for it.

[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.400]
That was sunny.

[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.620]
Well, see, in Kalamazoo, the great thing that we had going is that it was like midway

[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.000]
between Detroit and Chicago.

[00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.220]
So once in a while, if I was in a right mood, instead of going to Detroit,

[00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:28.760]
I had a couple of friends used to go with me.

[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.720]
When instead of going east, we'd go west, and we'd go to the sportsman's park,

[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.460]
or, um, Washington Park, or Washington Park in Chicago.

[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:34.840]
Yeah.

[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.760]
And stop in Grand Rapids.

[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.360]
They had, uh, Wind Shoe was restaurant.

[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.360]
They were one of my favorites.

[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.940]
And stop for dinner, and then go to the track in Chicago.

[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.760]
And did pretty well in those days.

[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.100]
Two of my side, you know, everybody, not everybody, but most people in life,

[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.640]
who are gambors, they have a period of time when it just,

[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:50.860]
everything goes right.

[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:51.860]
You can't do anything wrong.

[00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:56.120]
I remember one time I had 24 consecutive winning nights at Northfield Downs.

[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.420]
I've been on both sides of those things.

[00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:59.160]
Oh, well, yeah.

[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.160]
There's no question about it.

[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:00.940]
They make up for it.

[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.140]
It's like it would buy it.

[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:02.680]
It's the same thing.

[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.040]
You have a couple of good days, and then they get it back real fast.

[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.980]
But nothing that gambors are the most unthorned species there is.

[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:09.560]
That's correct.

[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.480]
You're right about that.

[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.520]
Absolutely correct, sir.

[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.480]
We just keep coming back to track.

[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.880]
They'll drive through a blizzard to get to a track.

[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.280]
Gambors are a lot like cats.

[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.980]
You can pick it up and throw it against the wall, and it comes back for more.

[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.480]
Just, uh, no way to say no.

[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:22.660]
It won't take no for answers.

[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.020]
That's right.

[00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.400]
Well, it's an over too much this weekend, kind of like, uh, you know,

[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.940]
I'm plunging my guts out.

[00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:30.060]
I'm plunging my guts out.

[00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:30.860]
I'm plunging my guts out.

[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:30.880]
I'm plunging my guts out.

[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:30.980]
I'm plunging my guts out.

[00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:31.120]
I'm plunging my guts out.

[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:31.120]

[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:31.120]

[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:31.120]

[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:31.120]

[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:31.120]

[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:31.120]

[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:31.120]

[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:31.120]

[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.300]
I haven't made a bet in a week.

[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:32.720]
I'm ready.

[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.220]
Well, that's right.

[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.300]
You got the hurricanes in Florida baseball game tomorrow.

[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:35.740]
That's the big one.

[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:36.760]
I won't be betting on that.

[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.180]
No, that would be a real sickle.

[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.960]
If you told me you were betting on that, I'd have you GA,

[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.780]
you'd have to drag your ass away.

[00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.100]
Or, nor will I bet on spring training baseball.

[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:44.900]
Oh, good.

[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.120]
I knew a guy.

[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:51.040]
He used to call me to ask me if I knew what the pitching rotation was going to be for the Orioles,

[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.640]
on a particular day, because he was betting exhibition baseball.

[00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:56.360]
That guy would end up.

[00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:58.820]
Well, he needs a little action.

[00:08:59.200 --> 00:08:59.920]
That's all it is.

[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.080]
Everybody could use a little action.

[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:01.400]
Yep.

[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.020]
Well, have a great weekend.

[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:03.580]
Hey, you too.

[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.660]
I'll see you Tuesday.

[00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.020]
I'm taking Monday off.

[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:07.020]
Don't take any wooden nickels.

[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:07.840]
OK.

[00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:08.600]
I'll be there.

[00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:09.240]
Be well.

[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.900]
Friday, you bastard.

[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:14.620]
Absolutely.

[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.380]
Oh, what's the problem, officer?

[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:21.500]
Deploy from the rear.

[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:29.200]
If you're caught driving without a seatbelt, you will be removed from your car and shot.

[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:34.680]
The police now have the authority to enforce seatbelt safety under the new Patriot Act 2.

[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.580]
The new law is in effect now.

[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.700]
So click it or be shot.

[00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.000]
Officers don't like doing this.

[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.800]
They are only following orders.

[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.840]
It's for your own protection in the never ending fight against terrorism.

[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.160]
Terrorists act such as mouth noise.

[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.320]
Herpes and fighting.

[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.200]
But be annoying to others.

[00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:58.320]
So under Patriot Act 2, eating will no longer be permitted in restaurants.

[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:03.180]
Anyone eating outside the designated eating area will also be shot.

[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.580]
It's the law.

[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.160]
We like saying that.

[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.240]
The law.

[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:11.420]
The law.

[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:12.280]
The law.

[00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.040]
The law.

[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:14.420]
The law.

[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:14.500]

[00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:15.200]
You said it.

[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:16.240]
I love that story.

[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:17.800]
I mean, I mean, it wasn't a great experience.

[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.140]
It's kind of a helpful feeling.

[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:23.600]
Try and like eat your bearings on a sheet of ice and you can't take a step, but spit it all around.

[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:28.340]
Getting an old man holding his hand or offering me to give me assistance to cross the street.

[00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:29.460]
Oh, I can't roll it.

[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:29.800]
I need it.

[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:30.500]
Wow.

[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.760]
That was really a wake up call.

[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.700]
And I know a lot of people are saying, well, you always used to make fun of the old people down here.

[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.900]
What are you saying now?

[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:39.200]
I know they're in a old code.

[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:40.380]
I got news for it.

[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:40.960]
It's not for them.

[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:41.680]
I'm still like a teenager.

[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:42.580]
No question.

[00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:43.980]
Did he get to be about 90?

[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.640]
Just about everybody's a hell of a lot older than you are.

[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:47.980]
You've got a walker yet, so.

[00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.180]
Not yet, Sonny.

[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:49.580]
No.

[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:50.500]
Especially the one.

[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.860]
I like the ones with little wheels on them.

[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:52.540]
Oh, those are the best.

[00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:53.520]
Well, what are those?

[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.700]
I don't understand what that is.

[00:10:54.860 --> 00:11:00.120]
I guess that's for people who don't have the strength to like, um, pick them up and get up like they could go.

[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.440]
And that's right.

[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.580]
You just screwed it along.

[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.420]
Oh, and I forgot to mention, oh, geez, what the hell is wrong?

[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:08.000]
We got all whipped up and that thing about the gambling and old people.

[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.660]
The marlins I want to talk to the Humphre about that.

[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:15.320]
Continuing to explore relocation of hell discussions with the top official from Oklahoma City.

[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.120]
But having decided what to make a visit there.

[00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.080]
Well, it's kind of hard to like make a move unless you're going to talk to some folks, you know.

[00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:28.400]
Oklahoma who attended Governor Mary Fowland City yesterday, she's spoken four times to Marlins Vice Chairman Joel Male about the team relocating.

[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.540]
And sent information about the market's demographic economic development.

[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.980]
She initiated the conversations by reading letter to Marlins president David Sampson last November.

[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:43.200]
Fowland said the Marlins requested information about a stadium financing plan, potential stadium sites, Oklahoma City's AAA baseball team,

[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.100]
their Red Hawks and the city's climate.

[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:50.340]
I've asked them several times to visit and they said after they receive the packet of information, it'll be considered.

[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:54.780]
Fowland said there's no planning place to help fund a stadium, but she and the governor are willing to consider it.

[00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.560]
Right. In other words, it's all pie in the sky.

[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:03.880]
What is this casino they keep showing on the certainly Nazi news network? Where is that? Is that in the galaxy? Oh, Harris.

[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:08.640]
Here in September. Taking a gamble on the return of gambling in the big easy.

[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.900]
Oh, it's in the Netherlands. I didn't realize they can handle it because you know, did you know that?

[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:13.800]
No, I didn't know.

[00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:17.700]
Well, how come I wouldn't talk to the hopper about that? I thought it was in the galaxy that we're showing us.

[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.600]
They got Harris into Orleans. Well, maybe there might be a reason to go there.

[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:25.060]
I'll tell you one thing. What won't be a lot of competition for the machines mine. You get a good machine.

[00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:32.220]
Of course, the other thing is they probably got them all set to pay out about 3% because they're not handling a whole lot of money at this time.

[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:41.600]
At 2.25 yesterday morning, bowling green police responded to a loud party at the Alpha Gamma Roe House at 1436 Chestnut.

[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:47.020]
I got to figure out where the hell this is. This Orlando during the investigation.

[00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.400]
No, this must be a, I don't know where the hell this is.

[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:54.280]
During the investigation of the agriculture fraternity, police discovered a goat in the basement.

[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.420]
It had no photo water with standing in its own urine and feces.

[00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:06.680]
They took the goat for the Humane Society and charged WKU freshman 19-year-old Trenton decoded Jackson of Henderson with secondary cruelty animals.

[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:10.040]
Where's Henderson? Is that in, I don't know why I had it.

[00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:17.160]
From WKO13, but I can't figure out on this where to hell what state or what the place is.

[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:23.280]
Very unusual. Anyway, Brian Peyton is the president of Western's Alpha Gamma Roe chapter.

[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:28.180]
He says the goat was brought in on a whim as a prank to make some pledges. They would have to have sex with it.

[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:32.520]
But Peyton says it wasn't a hazing related. No one was ever going to have sex with the goat. Right.

[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:37.740]
WKU's director of media relations at the university has notified the AGR's national offices

[00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.380]
to spend their chapter activities while they investigate.

[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:48.540]
See, there you go again. The fraternity craft we were talking about here states almost as having sex with the goat is almost as exhilarating as running naked on the beach with your frat bar, our buddies.

[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:54.020]
But not quite. This is what I'm not nearly right. What the, where is that WKU? Well, somebody read it.

[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.220]
Maybe it's Western Kentucky University. Does that sound logical?

[00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:58.540]
Okay. I'll buy it.

[00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:59.720]
I think it's got a shot. What are you saying?

[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.420]
From minutes after 10, let's take a look at that award-winning schedule.

[00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:07.120]
They we got GELDIETOON. Wow. That is a good way to squeak your way into the weekend.

[00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:14.600]
We got Mad Dog and Gatsby's and Davy at 4. Curtis Stevenson at 7, who is absolutely rock solid and then any K-10 o'clock tonight.

[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:19.340]
From minutes after 10, we got yesterday's pool 75. Oh, and you know what? I left off yesterday.

[00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:23.520]
I wonder what apologize were off the bat. Obvious ones. Well, there are a lot of somebody cartoons.

[00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:28.580]
Blondie and Dagwad. Oh, yeah. Isn't that bad? That'd be bad. And Andy Cat.

[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:32.560]
Right. I think well, was an Andy Cat mentioned or did I bring that?

[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:36.560]
No, he was a handicap. I see. But not Andy Cat. My favorite drunk and wife, Peter.

[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:41.580]
Right. There you go. Well, you're going to start with those drunk and Irishman comments again. We better move along.

[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:46.720]
I think it was British. Andy Cat? Yeah. No. Trust me. Andy Cat was British? Pretty sure.

[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.660]
We'll see. I learned something already. I think it was Irish.

[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:52.720]
When it comes to mattresses, there are a lot of gimmicks out there. The latest are so-called sleep numbers.

[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:58.540]
Otherwise known as air mattresses. They are called hot air mattresses because they're only warrantied in full for two years.

[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:03.960]
They squeak like hell. They pop just like that. They can lose their setting during the night and they cost you an arm and a leg.

[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:08.740]
If you really want a high quality brand name mattress, it'll give you a great night's sleep and will last for years and years.

I know some Irish, but I haven't had a Germany a lot and also an Amsterdam they start drinking about 9 out of the morning

[00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.630]
But then again, there's a probably the Brits in the Germans

[00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:11.870]
Oh, no, I mean the Dutch hate the Germans with such a passion. It's just it's really

[00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:18.570]
Estonishing the greatest I've told you this before the greatest insult because the languages sound very similar to the very guttural the greatest insult

[00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:22.190]
You can give to a Dutchman is to think that he's German. He'll give you a dick chain

[00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:26.970]
A lot of people are having a blast with that dick so to speak with that dick chanie

[00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:29.890]
I've got it down to a science now. I'm picking them off one by one every time

[00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:37.170]
So go on our website go on your Rogers dot com and keep yourself off the streets amused and have a great time little a bird shooting and

[00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:37.990]
Speaking of that

[00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:46.690]
Lafayette Colorado hours after laughing about vice president chanie's hunting missette Josh Kaiser was himself shot by a friend during a hunting expedition

[00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:49.070]
That'll teach him to laugh at our vice president won't it?

[00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:54.970]
The 21 year old Lafayette man was taken to the hospital Monday night after his girlfriend accidentally shot him while they were

[00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:59.570]
Trailing a raccoon that had been praying on chickens on his family's property. They were cool hunting

[00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:04.770]
I read that thing about the vice president said to myself. How can you shoot your friend with your gun and look what happened?

[00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:05.890]
He said on Tuesday

[00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:12.290]
Kaiser was crouched down look under a shed where he thought a wounded raccoon was hiding and a 17 year old girlfriend

[00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:16.530]
Accidentally shot him with a 22 caliber rifle police have identified her ass yet

[00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:18.090]
I like that

[00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:22.870]
We just an accident she came right up behind him and shot him and that dome

[00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:28.210]
Just an accident WQ a.m. Hello. Hey, me. Oh, how you doing there? Okay?

[00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:31.530]
The one I tried to get you yesterday that I couldn't make it the

[00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:37.690]
Park to know thinking of was a Mohammed cartoon. Oh, there you go. That's good. Yeah, now let's see if we can't get some

[00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:39.250]
I got a great story about that too

[00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:40.870]
Good segue

[00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:45.190]
Iranians love Danish pastries, but when they look for the flaky dessert at the bakery

[00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:48.110]
They now have to ask for roses of the prophet Mohammed

[00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:53.730]
This makes that whole thing about freedom fries pair one would significance those ragheads, man

[00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:56.890]
They got a sense of humor or what just amazing in other words

[00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:00.230]
They're pissed off, but not pissed off and I think you're about to give up their Danish pastries

[00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:05.730]
So instead of a before going them they're gonna call them something different roses of the prophet Mohammed

[00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:08.470]
Bakery's across the cathode where we're covering up their heads in fact

[00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:14.250]
We'll be great if we had that song airbree things coming up roses who did that Steve Lawrence and Eddie Gorm was it may?

[00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:17.470]
I think so bakeries across the capital were covering up there

[00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:19.370]
Oh, now you're not gonna have that in there. It's way better

[00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:24.890]
Whatever you got for Danish pastries Thursday after the confectioners union order the name change and retaliation for those

[00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:32.190]
caricatures of the Muslim prophet published in a Danish newspaper given the insults by Danish newspapers against the prophet as of now

[00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:36.570]
The name of Danish pastries will give way to rose of Mohammed pastries union instead its order

[00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:44.030]
God how stupid this is a punishment for those who started misusing freedom

[00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:48.390]
or expression to insult the sanctities of Islam said Ahmed Mahmoud Amamu

[00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:53.370]
Mammudi a cake shop owner in northern to ran one of the ran's most popular bakeries

[00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:58.810]
Danish pastries covered up the word Danish. That's the name of the place covered up the word Danish on its sign with a black banner

[00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:07.130]
Emplacened all who say in a reference to a martyred saint of Shiite Islam the vendors a traditional side of mourning the shop owner

[00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:10.930]
Declined a comet on Zartos street in central to Iran cake shop owner

[00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:15.290]
Mosque pedari didn't cover up the word Danish pastries on his menu, but put the new name next to it

[00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:19.950]
I did so just to inform my customers that rose of Mohammed is the new name for Danish pastries

[00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:24.270]
He said some customers took immediately the new name but others were less enthusiastic about the protest

[00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:29.830]
I just want to sweet pastries. I have nothing to do with the name homemaker Zorach Mosumi told the sales clerk taking order

[00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:31.810]
Just give me the Danish's and stuff the craft

[00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:34.390]
I said they like him. They want them and they don't give a crap

[00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:37.530]
You know so in other words their pissed off, but not that pissed off

[00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:39.710]
So the things that aren't made in

[00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:45.910]

Worst ending to Blair Witch Project wasn't even on there and you added on about I don't know 8 30

[00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:07.010]
8 o'clock 7 45

[00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:15.690]
Okay and it's gone from nowhere to number one 70 hands down man well it may not have been a good ending but at least it was consistent all the way through from when I hear

[00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:22.890]
Easy writer 66 I did see that but so long ago I forgot what about the bad ending war the world's 59 unacceptable

[00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:33.330]
Contact 54 AI artificial intelligence 48 vanilla sky 42 a apocalypse now 31 never got that far and never got close to the end of that

[00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:37.250]
Prandt of the aves 29 is that the part where writing McDowell comes out?

[00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:41.450]
Yeah, they might be talking about the most recent version. Yeah, I'm sure they are which is horrible

[00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:46.950]
I understand but that would have had nothing to do with writing McDowell saving private Ryan 28 to village 25

[00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:50.070]
Magnolia. Oh my god you people's man

[00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:56.530]
Magnolia 22 the abyss 17 Jacob's like see a lot of people don't like Magnolia for getting about the ending

[00:29:56.530 --> 00:30:03.930]
Our people that when they go to a movie they want they want a story that starts here and then's got a middle and there's like some tension

[00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:07.790]
There's some in the drama current and ends here and everybody's got a big smile on their face

[00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:13.570]
Like at the ending of improbable in heroes, you know imaginary hero right which the you know, it's a great movie

[00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:17.830]
But the ending is a little yeah a little severe but it's fine. It has a conclusion

[00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:24.030]
No, no complaints I got no complaints about right, but that's not how all good movies are or even most good movies are like that

[00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:30.110]
It's like for example American history actually does not have what you call the end goal, but man

[00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:34.710]
But it's you know, it's real crap the abyss 17 Jacobs ladder 13

[00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:42.130]
I did see that a very long time ago. I tried twice to watch that, but it's so long. I forget about the bad ending the birds 12

[00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:47.790]
Yeah, the birds well see now that movie is camp because the special effects are so bad

[00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:50.830]
You know, I could draw I could draw little pitches of birds and be a

[00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:55.610]
Dictaneous shot at least shot at better looking birds and nose didn't always hit him

[00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:59.250]
But and then the ending where they just kind of drive off and hear the birds are looking

[00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:01.090]
Oh, you know, it doesn't leave it to your imagination

[00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:05.510]
You wonder what what that'll happen after that, you know, maybe maybe that was like the beginning of the bird flu

[00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:11.570]
You think that could be never thought about it fight club 12 Donny Darko 12 good movie with a horrible ending

[00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:16.230]
I'm not well. I'm acceptable ending. Did you get through watching it or did you not waste your time?

[00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:21.090]
No, I watched it you watch the whole thing. I thought you said you don't watch the end. Oh, you know, you did watch the end

[00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:27.150]
Not good. Mulholland drive 11 talk about bizarre now. There's a movie that's all over the place

[00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:33.570]
Interesting but strange the natural 10 cold mountain nine Chinatown nine looking for mr. Goodbar nine

[00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:36.490]
Well, that's a bad candy bar. You ever have a mr. Goodbar?

[00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:40.370]
Hmm, I love mr. Goodbar. Let the one with the pirate here

[00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:47.370]
Your taste is in your taste, mr. I can't believe it. It's not a good candy bus toffee. What do you call it? Heath bar?

[00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:54.150]
No, and even even those Hershey bars with toffee hmm the anyway stop stop please

[00:31:54.910 --> 00:32:00.170]
The natural 10 cold my just got through in a fish called one to nine the game eight

[00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:02.830]
Another game that was wrong with Michael Douglas, right?

[00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:08.470]
I don't know. Yeah, that was where it's bad. No, it's not the movie is bad. No, it's not the ending is unacceptable

[00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:13.710]
It's a movie is not bad. Get out of here boy. You go eat your air mr. Goodbars

[00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:21.970]
Minority report eight crew is eight Superman two seven the color of money six LA confidential six LA story six boy

[00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:30.030]
A lot of bad endings in LA believe me blade runner five clue for platoon for the contender for 40 days and 49's four

[00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:34.570]
That's what Josh Hartons said the end of the tune was great. What are they talking about the ending?

[00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:42.390]
They didn't like I got most most I got a lot of these off list of bad endings on the internet and all of them had

[00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:46.490]
Explanations of why they hated but I wasn't gonna go through all of that

[00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:49.910]
I even ask you the same question where some of these don't make sense to me

[00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:55.490]
Well, I mean, I'm not I can't speak for other people's taste in a lot of movies that they're pissed off about I didn't see anyway

[00:32:55.490 --> 00:33:02.450]
So the hell of it to just on the list and listen to what some other people agree so they're getting votes the contender for 40 days and 49's four

[00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:09.250]
Just grab it already Josh not you but Josh Hartons just grab it and get it over with the big Lebowski for as good as it gets three

[00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:15.790]
Army of darkness three start us memories three pushing tin two. What the hell is that pushing tin?

[00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:20.570]
It's a air traffic controller movie. I think the close cages in it. Oh you can't cage

[00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:26.310]
God it sounds like something that Jackie Bales were the said pushing tin and Bosnia the heart rate kid to

[00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:31.570]
Four Jackie Bales. I wonder what ever happened to her murdered by death to 12 Angry Men 1 and Red River

[00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:35.090]
Don't have any other 733 vote. It was on somebody's list though red river

[00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:39.010]
12 Angry Men was a great movie but the ending they said that they didn't like for whatever reason and again

[00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:43.390]
I'm not gonna go back to the hole never stop that stuff to find out what why you know who

[00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:51.930]
Kill some good time. No, absolutely no. I got I got a huge pile here today. Maybe I could me got a big fat pile

[00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:54.310]
WQ I am hello

[00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:00.350]
Yes sir

[00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:01.510]
Neil Rogers

[00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:08.490]
This is a movie you keep talking about the motel movie right?

[00:34:08.490 --> 00:34:14.310]
One of the early Atlantic records. Yeah, I've seen that and if you like Layla

[00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:19.450]
I mean that's outstanding when the guy goes to Layla how he produced it. Yeah, that's I thought Layla

[00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:21.550]
American fat stomino

[00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:22.830]
There's a

[00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:29.210]
Cold the criminals with a guy that looks like he more either hot thing whatever that guy's aim is

[00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:33.210]
Looks just like him, but it's not him. Yeah, he looks like

[00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:37.210]
Which is the same movie in French. What is it?

[00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:38.350]
Nine Queens

[00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:40.870]
I know it nine Queens

[00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:46.710]
Clifters was some of that is that a good movie or just a bad ending?

[00:34:46.890 --> 00:34:49.930]
I'm standing and you gotta read the subtitles. You know, I can get by that

[00:34:49.930 --> 00:34:56.550]
No problem if I could handle it in the city of God. I can handle that and criminals is an American movie

[00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:58.690]
We make a bad I guess yeah

[00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:00.650]
I

[00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:02.630]
Know the Greg Reed gang

[00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:04.170]
I

[00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:10.870]
Know you want to leave me I'll tell you what if you have a watch standing in the shadows of motel go out and steal it today and watch it this weekend

[00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:14.750]
I just I just don't know what to say. I mean, I know a lot of people have gone out there and got it

[00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:19.050]
Thanks again to suds for the 4,000 time, but this is just it's like a part of my life

[00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:24.250]
It's more than just a movie. It's a part of my life, you know, I mean because it's motel and of course have a lived in Detroit

[00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:29.710]
Oh

[00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:36.510]
Anyway, go out and get it. I might just play the whole

[00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:37.450]
Joe Nazborn thing

[00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:39.810]
I it works me into a sweat when I listen to that thing

[00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:44.830]
I just can envision her singing it and real in a movie, you know, well play it and go get a towel and all those all those clips

[00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:49.550]
Of course, I guess they're from that concert that they had and I still don't understand what they don't go out touring

[00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:54.450]
And why they don't make a mold for it. They're just not as a party with Joe Nazborn and then just the the band

[00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:58.050]
And I don't know who they're using his vocal. Yeah, but why don't they take those vocalists that they had in there

[00:35:58.050 --> 00:36:04.250]
They're also great except of course for track icon except for her well because they're big names and have careers and what's the other the other chick

[00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:10.450]
That was in her whose name I can't she got all all consonants in her name. She needs a vowel movement Michelle

[00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:18.170]
The one that they use good head right Michelle in DG in jellicol or something like that. Is that how you say archipelago?

[00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:28.550]
It's still in DG O C L L O N X L L S M F T that's right. He's flying tobacco. Michelle mixell clicks it. L S M F T in a lucky strike means flying to

[00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:31.050]
Vanco. Let's start doing some cigarette spots.

[00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:41.670]

What time is the food show on them?

[00:52:21.110 --> 00:52:22.630]
I don't know, not soon enough for us

[00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:24.810]
I think it's probably going to be slobbing both you all over the mics

[00:52:24.810 --> 00:52:27.270]
Eating those fluffy, constant suts

[00:52:27.790 --> 00:52:28.950]
Sounds awful good to me

[00:52:29.590 --> 00:52:30.230]
WDQYM Hello

[00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:31.430]
Hello, Neil

[00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:32.350]
Yes, sir

[00:52:32.350 --> 00:52:33.190]
How you doing?

[00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:39.230]
Good. I'm wondering if you've had a chance to check out Mr. Lasseter's blog in the last week

[00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:43.070]
I just, you must be psychic because I just exchanged emails with him in the last day

[00:52:43.070 --> 00:52:44.630]
And then I got a response today

[00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:46.710]
He's not doing well, which I'm very sad to see

[00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:50.750]
Very sad and it also, you know, I can't put myself in his position

[00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:53.230]
But he sounds like he's quite down and it's unfortunate

[00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:57.550]
All right, but I can easily understand why he's quite down

[00:52:57.550 --> 00:53:00.650]
But he can reassess whether he wants to do the dialysis or whatever

[00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:01.770]
And it's up to him

[00:53:02.190 --> 00:53:03.970]
Absolutely, well I was very sad to see it

[00:53:03.970 --> 00:53:08.630]
And I'm kind of glad that you guys had a chat on the air a few weeks ago

[00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:11.890]
It was nice to hear, but I do wish him well, he's a good guy

[00:53:11.890 --> 00:53:13.270]
I agree, okay, thanks, pal

[00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:17.810]
Bye, bro. Yeah, I just got a nice response to, I mean, email them last night and then I got a response this morning

[00:53:17.810 --> 00:53:20.330]
Which is nice when people respond to your emails, you know that?

[00:53:20.570 --> 00:53:20.930]
Do I do?

[00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:24.170]
5670560, pound 560

[00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:27.110]
And again, like I admitted to him in my email last night

[00:53:27.110 --> 00:53:30.690]
You know, when I first, remember I first found out that he had all the health problems from the diabetes

[00:53:31.150 --> 00:53:33.550]
You know, you get on the air and you talk like, yeah, we talk

[00:53:33.550 --> 00:53:36.330]
Anybody can talk, but it means, but it means everybody talks

[00:53:36.330 --> 00:53:37.910]
Anybody can talk a good game

[00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:39.810]
It's another thing to practice what you preach

[00:53:39.810 --> 00:53:48.050]
And it's another thing to break life long, bad eating habits or smoking habits or drinking habits or gambling habits or all of these things

[00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:51.810]
So I told him I said, you know, I've been doing the best I can

[00:53:51.810 --> 00:53:54.210]
They lose a couple of pounds, but every now and then I stole it, you know

[00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:57.030]
Because I don't care what anybody says, you can argue all you want

[00:53:57.030 --> 00:54:03.190]
To me, sugar and you find carbohydrates are just as addictive as any drug ever known to a man and woman and child

[00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:04.030]
No question

[00:54:04.030 --> 00:54:05.470]
I mean, it's just addictive

[00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:09.550]
And at whole, the proof is in those pringles spots, you can't eat only one

[00:54:09.550 --> 00:54:17.050]
And that's the idea because they're loaded with chemicals and with stuff that do a tap-drag tap dance on your taste buds to make you want to eat more

[00:54:17.050 --> 00:54:18.830]
So you took, right? If you don't eat any, you're okay

[00:54:18.830 --> 00:54:21.470]
But once you eat the first one, you're screwed, you're going to eat the whole box

[00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:22.230]
By the way, it lays

[00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:22.850]
What?

[00:54:23.290 --> 00:54:24.210]
You can't eat the only one?

[00:54:24.370 --> 00:54:25.090]
I thought it was pringles

[00:54:25.090 --> 00:54:25.590]
It's not a slice

[00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:27.590]
Pringles is once you pop, you can't stop

[00:54:27.590 --> 00:54:29.550]
Yeah, but that's a sexual fact

[00:54:30.070 --> 00:54:33.410]
And just to prove them wrong, the last time I encountered a bag of Lays potato chips

[00:54:33.850 --> 00:54:35.170]
I mean, I haven't had another one

[00:54:35.170 --> 00:54:36.570]
But I don't even like Lays potato chips

[00:54:36.570 --> 00:54:37.030]
I'm serious

[00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:43.090]
In fact, I don't like potato chips in the first place, but in spite of that, if I got one of those tube

[00:54:43.090 --> 00:54:47.050]
A tube of pringles, I would eat probably the whole thing

[00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:48.750]
And you can't say you don't like them?

[00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:49.870]
Pringles, I said

[00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:51.490]
Yeah, I like pringles

[00:54:51.490 --> 00:54:52.490]
No, you don't understand

[00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:57.090]
And I mean, I don't like potato chips, but it's not something I would never go out and buy them

[00:54:57.090 --> 00:54:58.130]
That's what I mean

[00:54:58.130 --> 00:54:59.790]
In other words, it's not like bread

[00:54:59.790 --> 00:55:03.970]
I don't really care that much for bread if I never had it again, but if I go into a good restaurant

[00:55:03.970 --> 00:55:07.110]
Like at Ruth Chris or one of those places, they bring you a bunch of warm bread

[00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:08.570]
With garlic butter

[00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:10.570]
I'm gonna have the bread, you know?

[00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:10.810]
Yeah

[00:55:11.170 --> 00:55:12.650]
Right, here you go

[00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:16.510]
A little less than good garlic rolls like John and Baker's bringing you guys a little while

[00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:18.130]
For your father, for your father

[00:55:18.130 --> 00:55:18.670]
No, for me

[00:55:19.350 --> 00:55:20.650]
Thanks, but no thanks

[00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:25.610]
That's Chicago's answer to the invitation to submit a bid to host the 2008 Republican National Convention

[00:55:25.610 --> 00:55:29.530]
They already had that problem with Nazis in Illinois and Chicago was severed with Skokie

[00:55:29.530 --> 00:55:30.530]
Remember that a few years ago?

[00:55:30.690 --> 00:55:31.030]
Mm-hmm

[00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:34.130]
So they said, well, we had enough Nazis in Illinois already go someplace else

[00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:37.570]
You Republican National Committee said yesterday, Chicago went 30 other cities

[00:55:37.570 --> 00:55:38.510]
Not 30, man

[00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:42.390]
We're selected to submit a bid explaining why they'd be a good choice to host the 2008 Convention

[00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:45.810]
But a spokesman for Mayor Dick Daily said, city hall ain't interested

[00:55:45.810 --> 00:55:51.690]
Jackie Hurd said, city officials are more focused on whether the pursuer campaign was the 2016 summer Olympics

[00:55:51.690 --> 00:55:54.430]
Chicago hosted the Democratic National Convention 96

[00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:56.130]
But there you go

[00:55:56.130 --> 00:56:01.650]
No thanks to the Republicans, the American Nazi Party formerly known as the Republican Party

[00:56:02.890 --> 00:56:05.650]
56670560, pound 560, they've arrived in Singular Wireless Line

[00:56:05.650 --> 00:56:08.270]
The worst movie ending you've ever seen

[00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:11.290]
You know, then, and to me, it's just, it's deflating

[00:56:11.290 --> 00:56:15.690]
You spend an hour and a half, two hours, maybe even two and a half or more, hours of your time

[00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:17.310]
Especially you think, huh?

[00:56:17.550 --> 00:56:20.030]
If you actually bought a ticket, you know, and drove all the way out there

[00:56:20.030 --> 00:56:21.270]
That's even worse, or a $20

[00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:25.430]
Even worse than that, if you went out and you spent like 20, 30 bucks for the DVD

[00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:29.970]
You know, that American History X, that wasn't a two for $30 a bid in 50 bucks

[00:56:29.970 --> 00:56:31.250]
Yeah, unbelievable

[00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:31.970]
Oh yeah

[00:56:31.970 --> 00:56:36.710]
We got these HMV, I don't think that's in, you've gotten the States to the HMV record source

[00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:38.270]

Well, I want it

[00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:45.850]
But they got it

[00:56:45.850 --> 00:56:47.950]
Oh, and I still got to get you a La Cajafol

[00:56:48.310 --> 00:56:51.590]
Oh, you know what that was on the other day, but it was the wrong version

[00:56:51.590 --> 00:56:54.610]
Oh, the new one, that was, that was, that was how to be shot for the,

[00:56:54.650 --> 00:56:58.610]
Another movie that did not need to be remade, that somebody had to be murdered for doing that

[00:56:58.610 --> 00:57:01.590]
The original you, they get a lot of laughs out of it, trust me when I tell you

[00:57:01.590 --> 00:57:02.070]
I trust you

[00:57:02.070 --> 00:57:05.150]
Especially the scene where he's dressing up like, like mommy

[00:57:07.610 --> 00:57:07.930]
Oh

[00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:13.950]
And where he's eating, where the, I can't go in there, eating the soup and it's got the pictures of the young boys

[00:57:13.950 --> 00:57:19.950]
Frollicking as he said at the young children frollicking no girls, but in the soupables that you know those queens

[00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:21.790]

And I'll give you a round of shots

[00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:50.310]
And of course they didn't even ask to take breathalyzer test because what would have been employed like the next morning right by the gun cagey

[00:59:50.310 --> 00:59:51.250]
Huh? Right?

[00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:52.090]
What would have been employed?

[00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:56.790]
Couple of old geese go bird hunting in the shooting fishing in barrel with a couple of chicks that aren't their wives

[00:59:57.650 --> 01:00:00.570]
And you know had a little bit snuckered in the afternoon

[01:00:00.570 --> 01:00:04.530]
In fact the only thing that Woodington said is that there was no drinking during the hunting

[01:00:04.530 --> 01:00:06.330]
Well what about before the hunting?

[01:00:06.530 --> 01:00:09.410]
You know how about in the car on the way up to the...

[01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:10.070]
There you go

[01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:11.710]
That's exactly correct

[01:00:11.710 --> 01:00:15.290]
So they got a little sloshed and were like staggering around there and about bang

[01:00:15.290 --> 01:00:17.430]
Yeah, Taney saw something move

[01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.890]

[01:00:24.070 --> 01:00:26.390]

I'll tell you one thing, you have to be straight as an arrow when you watch that movie

[01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:10.710]
You have to be very alert, no drugs because or maybe just the opposite

[01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:14.950]
Maybe you have to be on a lot of drugs because it's very hard to follow

[01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:48.910]
Don N4 Lauderdale says, Pushing 10 if anybody cares they're John Q Second Billy Bob Thornton

[01:02:48.910 --> 01:02:53.110]
It was about air traffic controllers but I can't tell you about the ending I never made it halfway through

[01:02:53.110 --> 01:02:54.890]
Oh that good huh?

[01:02:55.010 --> 01:02:58.370]
I did sit through a snatch last night on Georgia's My Sun's Recommendation

[01:02:58.370 --> 01:03:00.610]
It was pretty good, now I was glad I watched it till the end

[01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:03.390]
Did I watch it? I know I got it in the other room, did I watch it?

[01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:05.650]
You didn't you didn't you would have said so

[01:03:05.650 --> 01:03:07.190]
No, you didn't even tell me about it

[01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.350]
You didn't even tell me about it

[01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:11.590]
It's a combination of oceans 11 pulp fiction and Hannibal with a touch of a touch of fight club

[01:03:11.590 --> 01:03:15.170]
That's a good good work and then keep the spirit of Moe alive, chomp chomp

[01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:16.050]
It's just down the floor

[01:03:16.050 --> 01:03:17.570]
Yeah there you go, there's a story

[01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:19.670]
Keep in his spirit alive, okay?

[01:03:19.890 --> 01:03:22.070]
You don't even know me that you bought that movie?

[01:03:22.690 --> 01:03:23.130]
I beg your pardon?

[01:03:23.450 --> 01:03:24.630]
Snatch, you didn't tell me you bought that?

[01:03:24.890 --> 01:03:26.670]
I got it, so I've had that for a long time

[01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:26.870]
Really?

[01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:29.690]
A long time, I've got some of the few movies in there, I bought

[01:03:29.690 --> 01:03:31.190]
What's about Tony gave it a try?

[01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:34.130]
In fact let me go, I'm gonna grab a movie right now, play a little thing

[01:03:34.130 --> 01:03:37.730]
Because I wanted to tell you, it looked, I was in buying stuff the other day

[01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:40.610]
And I don't know about you, well you're a shlupper so you can't afford to do it right?

[01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:44.390]
If I see something that looks interesting to me, I'll just grab that and put it in my pile

[01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:45.450]
And I'll buy that too

[01:03:45.450 --> 01:03:46.150]
Yeah, it must be nice

[01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:48.590]
So, it's a play a little like Ditty or something

[01:03:51.610 --> 01:03:53.450]
And I'll get tired of this, because I had to Ditty

[01:03:55.530 --> 01:03:56.690]
It's Ditty Gritty

[01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:59.450]
Now that you mention it, there's Ditty

[01:04:01.830 --> 01:04:04.950]
You got your jugg, you got your moot head, you got your air

[01:04:06.730 --> 01:04:07.870]
It's called Say Nothing

[01:04:08.330 --> 01:04:08.710]
Okay?

[01:04:09.170 --> 01:04:12.130]
With William Baldwin, Natasha Kinsky and Hart-Bockner

[01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:15.250]
And on the back it says, obsession can't keep quiet

[01:04:15.250 --> 01:04:20.510]
Grace Natasha Kinsky is a beautiful ice model whose merit suffers from a husband, Matt, Hart-Bockner

[01:04:20.510 --> 01:04:21.890]
loses a job and turns to drink

[01:04:21.890 --> 01:04:25.790]
Alone on a chance weekend away, she meets a mysterious stranger William Baldwin

[01:04:25.790 --> 01:04:27.730]
And in a moment a weakness he seduces her

[01:04:28.110 --> 01:04:30.610]
On a return home, Matt has a new job, everything seems gritty

[01:04:30.610 --> 01:04:33.610]
And she suppresses her girl, the size of the best to say nothing, that's the name of the movie

[01:04:34.130 --> 01:04:37.590]
But the passionate stranger has no intention of being forgotten, hillist, for everything that gets in his way

[01:04:37.590 --> 01:04:39.490]
And she's not the target of his danger of obsession

[01:04:39.490 --> 01:04:44.370]
Sounds like fatal attraction, or it sounds like they missed the format, one of those jilted, you know what I'm saying?

[01:04:44.570 --> 01:04:47.350]
By the way, now that you got the movie with her name on it written in front of you

[01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:51.670]
Please sound it out, because I think I've been mispronouncing it my whole life

[01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:52.690]
Natasha Kinsky?

[01:04:52.930 --> 01:04:55.450]
Well I've always said Natasha, but apparently it's Nastasia

[01:04:56.090 --> 01:04:58.190]
Oh you're right, I didn't look at that close to him

[01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:58.950]
All my life

[01:04:58.950 --> 01:05:01.990]
Yeah, it's got an S, Nastasia, yeah Kinsky

[01:05:02.690 --> 01:05:04.790]
And Natasha wouldn't be with the J anyway

[01:05:04.790 --> 01:05:05.090]
Right

[01:05:05.090 --> 01:05:08.010]
Well Josh knows that, he knows his Natasha's

[01:05:08.010 --> 01:05:09.790]
Yes he does, and his name is Russian Chicks

[01:05:11.010 --> 01:05:15.870]
Nastasia, Nastasia, whatever name is Kinsky, but anyway, so I looked it up after I brought it home, I haven't watched it yet

[01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:21.030]
And I'm a little bit of a leery of watching because I looked it up on the IMDB, 5.1 stars

[01:05:21.030 --> 01:05:27.950]
I mean, it's got to be pretty weak, and you know they're all saying, well you've seen fatal attraction, you've seen it's the same old, you know

[01:05:27.950 --> 01:05:30.310]
But it looks like a pretty good cast, right?

[01:05:30.970 --> 01:05:32.610]
Right? You don't think so, huh?

[01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:34.010]
I don't know, it looks interesting

[01:05:34.610 --> 01:05:39.490]
Well maybe somebody in the audience knows what I was doing, saying nothing, and I would have to waste my time watching it

[01:05:39.490 --> 01:05:44.830]
How long is it by the way? So, hour and 34 minutes, and obviously to me that's fine, hour and a half

[01:05:45.850 --> 01:05:49.290]
That's just fine, and I will say this because I also brought this in the same time

[01:05:49.290 --> 01:05:52.830]
A hundred eleven minutes is what, hour and fifty-one, and almost two hours, imaginary heroes

[01:05:52.830 --> 01:05:58.450]
And yet the last time I watched it when I went out and bought this disc, I bought it at IMDB and I watched it again

[01:05:58.450 --> 01:06:01.350]
And it seemed like about 20 minutes, that's how much I enjoyed that movie

[01:06:01.350 --> 01:06:04.170]
It does it right on by, I just like it

[01:06:06.350 --> 01:06:11.170]
56670560, pound 560 on the Virginia and the Alaska wireless line

[01:06:11.170 --> 01:06:14.750]
There is a Santa Claus Virginia, there is no God, but there is a Sandy Claus

[01:06:15.350 --> 01:06:17.130]
Just talk on his beard, he'll scream like hell

[01:06:17.130 --> 01:06:18.670]
Somebody QYM, hello?

[01:06:19.090 --> 01:06:19.550]
Hey, Neil

[01:06:19.550 --> 01:06:20.710]
Yes, ma'am

[01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:22.730]
I wanted to add one to your poll if I'm named

[01:06:22.730 --> 01:06:23.310]
Okay

[01:06:24.350 --> 01:06:24.750]
Unsafeful

[01:06:25.170 --> 01:06:25.570]
Okay

[01:06:26.530 --> 01:06:28.810]
You've probably never seen it for the Richard Gears in it

[01:06:28.810 --> 01:06:30.590]
Oh my God, thank God I didn't see that

[01:06:30.590 --> 01:06:35.690]
The guy in lane is in it and it's the most unsatisfying ending ever

[01:06:35.690 --> 01:06:36.250]
Okay

[01:06:36.250 --> 01:06:39.990]
You know, it can be riveting it some, George, did you ever see that movie?

[01:06:40.270 --> 01:06:40.690]
I don't know

[01:06:40.690 --> 01:06:42.110]
Oh, okay

[01:06:43.030 --> 01:06:43.630]
Another movie

[01:06:43.630 --> 01:06:45.970]
The Richard Gears in it is so it's unlikely, you're probably not

[01:06:45.970 --> 01:06:51.150]
Yeah, I think you only saw the primal fear with him, but I've never seen that one

[01:06:51.150 --> 01:06:52.570]
Okay, thanks

[01:06:52.570 --> 01:06:53.670]
Thanks, have a great weekend

[01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:54.190]
You too

[01:06:54.810 --> 01:06:56.830]
Okay, you see you didn't see say nothing or she would have said something

[01:06:56.830 --> 01:06:58.210]
I've mentioned nobody's seen it

[01:06:58.210 --> 01:07:03.730]
So I guess I'll just one of these very, it says being faithful can be unfaithful can be deadly or whatever it says

[01:07:03.730 --> 01:07:05.090]
It probably sucks

[01:07:05.090 --> 01:07:09.910]
I know, it just looked interesting, you know, I just thought you were reading the blurb on it and that's so William Baldwin was in it

[01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:12.710]
I thought that's probably pretty interesting, you never know until you watch it

[01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:13.550]
That's for sure

[01:07:13.550 --> 01:07:15.750]
In other words, why read those reviews and pay attention

[01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:19.430]
Just like City of God, I enjoyed it very much and read it, I finally did watch it

[01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:23.410]
I give it like a good seven and a half star

[01:07:23.410 --> 01:07:26.290]
A thumb and a half up

[01:07:26.290 --> 01:07:29.230]
Well, that Roger Ebert, he's always stuck in a thumb somewhere

[01:07:29.230 --> 01:07:30.990]
A rectum and usually somebody else from this room

[01:07:30.990 --> 01:07:31.890]
A straight guy on that show

[01:07:31.890 --> 01:07:32.770]
Oh God

[01:07:33.290 --> 01:07:36.050]
Yeah, sure Mr. Jean, that goes to show you there's no God

[01:07:36.050 --> 01:07:38.130]
What was the guy's name, Jean Asiskel?

[01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.650]
Yes

[01:07:38.650 --> 01:07:40.670]
He's dead and he had a Roger East

[01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:42.310]
And he was a good guy

[01:07:42.870 --> 01:07:48.610]
And Roger Ebert, just like what, with the last thing we use another mincing queen movie, Critical, okay, give me a break

[01:07:48.610 --> 01:07:52.210]
And then remember who married that black chick for about ten minutes, so for tax purposes

[01:07:52.210 --> 01:07:54.610]
You don't have a crap like that, that scam he had going

[01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:56.610]
Hey Roger, you ain't fooling nobody

[01:07:56.610 --> 01:07:59.330]
In fact, I would be surprised if he's in there with Tom and the John Revolver

[01:07:59.330 --> 01:08:01.630]
This is Neil Roger

[01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:02.310]
You failed

[01:08:02.310 --> 01:08:06.230]
This is 516-Q-A-Z

[01:08:06.890 --> 01:08:07.970]
How far is Falcon?

[01:08:08.430 --> 01:08:09.770]
In theaters now

[01:08:09.770 --> 01:08:11.610]
When a stranger calls

[01:08:13.550 --> 01:08:14.030]
Hello?

[01:08:14.330 --> 01:08:16.190]
Hi, this is Paul from Surprise, Mike Sutter

[01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:19.070]
We have great news for you regarding the content, Andrew

[01:08:19.990 --> 01:08:23.810]
You must be Jill, we were so thrilled to find a baby Sutter at the last minute

[01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:25.310]
That's Paul?

[01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:28.770]
This is Rachel and I'm calling you calling me, actually it's one that you had spelled out at

[01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:31.090]
Keeps I'm calling you safe inside the house

[01:08:32.730 --> 01:08:33.990]
Why are you doing this?

[01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:35.290]
Now what do you want?

[01:08:37.410 --> 01:08:40.150]
Unfortunately, it's time again that we have to finish

[01:08:40.150 --> 01:08:41.890]
Stop calling me

[01:08:41.890 --> 01:08:45.350]
Jill is the police, we traced the call, it's coming from inside the house

[01:08:45.350 --> 01:08:46.090]
Hear me?

[01:08:46.350 --> 01:08:47.930]
She's coming from inside the house

[01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:53.210]
This guy's actually one of our top four major prizes

[01:08:54.170 --> 01:08:55.450]
Who is it?

[01:08:57.670 --> 01:08:59.730]
Oh, yeah, the promo they're sure when I call

[01:09:00.230 --> 01:09:01.730]
It's coming from inside the house

[01:09:01.730 --> 01:09:05.030]
So, my father goes to you and they already tip you off the whole story

[01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:07.210]
Plus, the remake is really bad out here

[01:09:07.210 --> 01:09:09.410]
You want to see the movie Go Get The Original One

[01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:11.450]
When a stranger calls with Charles Durning, you'll love it

[01:09:11.450 --> 01:09:12.770]
It's very good, I give it like eight stars

[01:09:12.770 --> 01:09:16.350]
Now, I think it's bad news for me on say nothing with William Baldwin

[01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:20.250]
Because I just looked at the first review here on IMDB

[01:09:20.250 --> 01:09:22.350]
from Table Addict from the USA

[01:09:22.350 --> 01:09:24.930]
Two out of ten stars, he says E-Gads

[01:09:24.930 --> 01:09:25.730]
E-Gads

[01:09:26.310 --> 01:09:28.750]
I used to think Keanu Reeves was the worst actor in Hollywood

[01:09:28.750 --> 01:09:31.790]
I'm not so sure anymore, Willi Gius Keanu, some stiff competition

[01:09:31.790 --> 01:09:34.590]
with his on made of plaster performance in this movie

[01:09:34.590 --> 01:09:36.950]
Combined that with the fact that he's almost no plot

[01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:38.490]
And on a single likable character

[01:09:38.490 --> 01:09:40.250]
And it's pretty hard to recommend this turkey

[01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:43.310]
Natasha, he writes, not Nastasia, he writes Natasha

[01:09:43.310 --> 01:09:44.750]
Say most people love him

[01:09:44.750 --> 01:09:48.070]
Try your best, but even Julia Roberts couldn't say this flick from obscurity

[01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:50.750]
Avoid it unless it's really late and there's nothing else on

[01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:52.890]
Oh heck, in that case, just read a book

[01:09:52.890 --> 01:09:55.770]
Wow, I can't be more condemning and damning that

[01:09:55.770 --> 01:09:59.070]
And here I got a bitch who has spent 15 bucks maybe more than that

[01:09:59.070 --> 01:10:00.010]
But third man

[01:10:00.010 --> 01:10:02.470]
For this piece of garbage and say nothing I guess

[01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:05.390]
Well, put it in your survival kit and use it to signal planes

[01:10:06.170 --> 01:10:07.750]
There you go, you could spend it on an island

[01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:10.130]
Okay, and just let it across the ice yesterday before Melton

[01:10:10.130 --> 01:10:12.470]
Join George's through our afternoon from 1 to 3pm

[01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:15.350]
Advanced pro shops off I-95 in River Road in Daniel

[01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:16.350]
One to three tomorrow afternoon

[01:10:16.350 --> 01:10:18.110]
And George is so anxious to see everybody

[01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:19.290]
So we get some more of these deals

[01:10:19.290 --> 01:10:21.550]
That he's even welcoming the guy with a funny character

[01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:26.170]
Guy with the eyes, Jack with the hands, that guy with the agupi hand

[01:10:26.170 --> 01:10:27.990]
The firemen were juggling chainsaws

[01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:29.630]
Stop by this filthy opportunity

[01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:31.530]
I'm going to chance to win some really crappy free prizes

[01:10:31.530 --> 01:10:33.210]
The ones that didn't get auctioned off on eBay

[01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:37.150]
5,670, 560, pound 560

[01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:39.010]
And they've rising in singular wireless lines

[01:10:39.010 --> 01:10:40.390]
And sure got quiet on that island, you know?

[01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:41.850]
All much of this info must be over here though

[01:10:41.850 --> 01:10:42.450]
It's just whiter

[01:10:42.450 --> 01:10:46.190]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:48.610]
823 vote

[01:10:48.610 --> 01:10:50.510]
We're going to make it to a thousand, although not...

[01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:51.170]
Not spectacular

[01:10:51.170 --> 01:10:53.650]
Probably because I need to take a lot more calls, get more movies on it

[01:10:53.650 --> 01:10:55.270]
Well, I got too much stuff here right now

[01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:58.790]
Law enforcement officers harvested a dubious record last year

[01:10:58.790 --> 01:11:00.730]
Enough marijuana plants to rank the illegal weed

[01:11:00.730 --> 01:11:03.070]
Is Washington states number eight agricultural commodity

[01:11:03.070 --> 01:11:04.970]
Eging out sweet cherries in value

[01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:06.230]
OOOOOO

[01:11:06.230 --> 01:11:09.630]
The 135,000 plus marijuana plant seized in 2005

[01:11:09.630 --> 01:11:11.670]
Or estimated to be worked to 170 million bucks

[01:11:11.670 --> 01:11:13.870]
A record amount that places the crop among the states

[01:11:13.870 --> 01:11:15.230]
Top 10 agricultural commodities

[01:11:15.230 --> 01:11:17.610]
Based on the most recent statistics available

[01:11:17.610 --> 01:11:20.270]
And I'm sure that the chief timonies son is very proud too

[01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:23.310]
We're struck by the amount of work they put into it said rich Wiley

[01:11:23.310 --> 01:11:24.930]
I wonder if he's kind of Wiley Coyote

[01:11:24.930 --> 01:11:27.110]
Who is the Washington state patrol narcotics program

[01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:28.050]
He's an ARC

[01:11:28.050 --> 01:11:31.030]
Just like they've hit in imaginary heroes, an ARC

[01:11:31.570 --> 01:11:33.450]
It... ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[01:11:33.450 --> 01:11:36.090]
That scene was great once you won't see it

[01:11:36.090 --> 01:11:36.730]
But he's...

[01:11:36.730 --> 01:11:37.930]
Sigurani Weaver is the best

[01:11:37.930 --> 01:11:41.310]
It's very labor-intensive. They offer run individual drip lines to each plant

[01:11:41.310 --> 01:11:42.730]
They're out there fertilizing them

[01:11:43.330 --> 01:11:44.030]
There you go

[01:11:44.030 --> 01:11:46.710]
A single tank can produce as much as a pound of processed marijuana

[01:11:46.710 --> 01:11:48.930]
Worth an estimated two grand, he'd be saying

[01:11:50.150 --> 01:11:51.730]
So go out to Washington state

[01:11:51.730 --> 01:11:54.530]
And then you can go up to... you can go right up the Hershey highway

[01:11:54.530 --> 01:11:57.470]
To Vancouver, into BC and smoke it there

[01:11:57.470 --> 01:11:58.530]
Right out in public

[01:11:59.070 --> 01:12:02.490]
Dog Thompson, your buddy at the Iran, at the Acapital Hill Blue

[01:12:03.150 --> 01:12:05.350]
Says those bagpipes you hear playing in the background

[01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:08.630]
Provide a much-needed funeral dirage for a freedom which died this week

[01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:10.550]
At the hands of the United States Congress

[01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:13.430]
Freedom has been on its deathbed for about five years now

[01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:16.230]
Mortally wounded and post-9-11 of frenzy that put political

[01:12:16.230 --> 01:12:18.930]
Expeediency above the Constitution and gave paranoid

[01:12:18.930 --> 01:12:22.190]
A supremacy over what used to be guarantees of individual rights for all Americans

[01:12:23.030 --> 01:12:24.570]
Freedom went on the endangered species

[01:12:24.570 --> 01:12:28.350]
Less than the hours following the 9-11 attacks when President Bush turned to attorney General John Ascroff

[01:12:29.010 --> 01:12:31.650]
And said, John, take whatever steps you feel are necessary

[01:12:31.650 --> 01:12:34.610]
To make sure something like this never ever happens again

[01:12:35.150 --> 01:12:40.090]
Turning a zealot like Ascroff, loose on the Constitution, is like giving Bill Clinton the keys to a sorority house

[01:12:40.090 --> 01:12:43.110]
Someone is going to get screwed big time, in this case it was collectively

[01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:45.710]
The whole concept of freedom and individual rights in this country

[01:12:46.190 --> 01:12:50.030]
Ascroff crafted his personal vision of a new America, one ruled by a police state

[01:12:50.030 --> 01:12:53.590]
Reported in ways of a territory in government and called it the USA Patriot Act

[01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:57.170]
It sales through a shell-shot Congress like a fraternity on a panty raid

[01:12:57.170 --> 01:13:00.830]
And gave Bush his gang of thugs all he needed to create a new American Gestapo

[01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:04.930]
Detaining this nation's citizens without due course, spying on Americans without warrants

[01:13:04.930 --> 01:13:06.970]
And setting the country on a headlong rush to ruin

[01:13:06.970 --> 01:13:11.690]
The abuses of the Patriot Act proved so unerased that even fair-brand conservatives like Bob Barr

[01:13:11.690 --> 01:13:15.590]
Joined forces with uber liberals like ACLU to affight it

[01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:20.770]
Late last year, spurred by anger over Bush's admission that he authorized the warrantless spying on Americans by the NSA

[01:13:20.770 --> 01:13:24.070]
The Patriot Act appeared to face serious opposition when it came up for renewal

[01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:29.230]
Congress twice granted temporary extensions and promised to add new language to protect the civil liberties of Americans

[01:13:29.230 --> 01:13:35.110]
But as happens all too often in Washington, these promises vanished into thin air as the Patriot Act this week

[01:13:36.050 --> 01:13:40.710]
Cleared hurdle after hurdle and heads for permanent renewal when the goons who call themselves our elected representatives

[01:13:40.710 --> 01:13:42.470]
Returned from the president's day recess

[01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:49.130]
In the end, in the end, the White House negotiated a set of meaningless changes with a handful of Republicans

[01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:53.070]
And the so-called compromise sailed to the Senate Thursday on vote of 96 to 3

[01:13:53.070 --> 01:13:58.090]
Even worse, the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee successfully blocked attempts to open an inquiry

[01:13:58.090 --> 01:14:00.650]
into Bush's use of the NSA to spy on all Americans

[01:14:00.650 --> 01:14:03.130]
Not that Democrats did that much to stop it

[01:14:03.130 --> 01:14:08.430]
Even those who spoke out about Bush's spying on Americans said they supported the cons that put only a post how the president went about it

[01:14:08.430 --> 01:14:12.030]
As long as he got warrants, they said they didn't really care who the NSA snooped on

[01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:16.750]
And a bunch of Democrats joined Republicans yesterday to keep rights-rapping USA-Pingradect law of the land

[01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:24.570]
Which means virtually no one, Democrat or Republican, conservative or liberal, left or right can claim the high rule when it comes to destroying freedom in the USA

[01:14:24.570 --> 01:14:31.190]
Only Senate or Russ Fine Gold, Democrat or Wisconsin, seems to realize the dangers of the act, continuing to fight and save the law even as amended

[01:14:31.190 --> 01:14:37.510]
Allows the government-fishing expeditions and out-right-allows the government-fishing expeditions had an outright assault on the Constitution

[01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:41.110]
For the most part, the rest of Congress sold out the people elected into office

[01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:46.390]
All Americans who depend on Congress to serve as a check-in balance on the excesses of the White House and the Constitution of the USA

[01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:53.810]
Yes, Freedom did die this week and just about every one of the bishops and bachelors of serving Congress should take a long hard look at the blood on their hands

[01:14:53.810 --> 01:14:59.430]
They stand guilty of high crimes and treason against the U.S. of A. Their trade isn't should be treated as such

[01:14:59.430 --> 01:15:00.690]
Let's send him all the...

[01:15:00.690 --> 01:15:02.850]
Abu Gharr... Ravel K. for this, banking anyway

[01:15:02.850 --> 01:15:03.710]
I'll grab the bus

[01:15:03.710 --> 01:15:08.830]
Got those pictures on our website if you want to really get grossed out if you want to see a bunch of naked and blot it up by Iraqis

[01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:11.570]
And then you want to see the guy with that third foot, that's kind of cute

[01:15:11.570 --> 01:15:15.370]
But I think most of the weekend you'll be spending time to go and duck hunting with a vice president

[01:15:15.370 --> 01:15:19.330]
You want to have to shoot a little bird in the brush

[01:15:19.330 --> 01:15:24.810]
Can't stop that once you get on that thing man, you just can't stop because you can keep picking them off one by one just a beautiful thing

[01:15:26.090 --> 01:15:30.590]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 and leave a rising singular wireless line

[01:15:30.590 --> 01:15:33.350]
Giole the atubis afternoon, wow wow wow wow wow

[01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:34.670]
What can you say about that?

[01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:37.690]
Mad Dog at gaspies and Davy, credit 7 to 10, 80k

[01:15:37.690 --> 01:15:39.470]
10 o'clock tonight, bet on it

[01:15:40.210 --> 01:15:40.930]
WQAM, hello

[01:15:43.190 --> 01:15:43.550]
QAM

[01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:45.930]
Sounds like they're going to be a very short call

[01:15:45.930 --> 01:15:47.490]
It sounds like what's your wipers?

[01:15:47.730 --> 01:15:49.890]
Yeah, it does, sounds like Paul Winshel wipers

[01:15:49.890 --> 01:15:54.730]
Look at that phone man, dead is a door nail, not a single call and that's because they've been bap bapai

[01:15:54.730 --> 01:15:57.030]
Anyone, I still got to do a lot more bap bapai all day

[01:15:57.030 --> 01:15:59.070]
Got a lot of bap bapai to do today

[01:15:59.650 --> 01:16:02.070]
A man on a mission like Howard Beale, I'm saying

[01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:04.330]
A man on a mission

[01:16:04.330 --> 01:16:06.390]
So let's go fishing, all right

[01:16:07.370 --> 01:16:08.130]
WQAM, hello

[01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:15.910]
Hey Neil, I was listening the other day you had a Yiddish lesson on about the roots of the word Fagalong

[01:16:15.910 --> 01:16:18.730]
That's what the chain is buddy, we're hunting, Fagalong

[01:16:21.230 --> 01:16:23.510]
Wow, I'll put that in my pocket to allow later

[01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:26.230]
Well let's get child I'll come and see if he can decode that one

[01:16:26.230 --> 01:16:28.730]
This is Neil Rogers

[01:16:28.730 --> 01:16:32.890]
Oh, this is 5.62 AF

[01:16:34.710 --> 01:16:36.550]
Friday you bastard

[01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:46.790]
And now another verse of celebrity poetry

[01:16:47.690 --> 01:16:52.590]
Here's a tale of lunacy backed by Scientology

[01:16:52.590 --> 01:16:58.890]
No brain cells left in Tom Cruise cupboard for they were stolen by Elron Hubbard

[01:16:58.890 --> 01:17:03.970]
When Tom speaks his mouth it forms affirming his love for Katie Holmes

[01:17:03.970 --> 01:17:07.810]
Up on the couch he jumps with B he thinks he's saying remarkably

[01:17:07.810 --> 01:17:12.590]
His mind looks like a red-war mural prohibiting Katie and epidural

[01:17:12.590 --> 01:17:16.810]
He says others don't use their brain when it's Tom himself who is insane

[01:17:16.810 --> 01:17:21.510]
He calls Matt Lauer cold and glib when it's he who needs a dribble bib

[01:17:21.510 --> 01:17:26.990]
His lady friend smiles her clueless smile she's no smother than bathroom tile

[01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:31.690]
Her eyes too close to teeth as few perhaps she has the avian flu

[01:17:31.690 --> 01:17:35.530]
Feel free if you must to disagree with the teachings of Scientology

[01:17:35.530 --> 01:17:40.490]
But on this my friend we can find common ground their level of brain damage is profound

[01:17:40.490 --> 01:17:46.370]
The facts are strange the future shady for crazy Tom and fiance Katie

[01:17:46.370 --> 01:17:51.870]
This has been another verse of celebrity poetry

[01:17:51.870 --> 01:17:55.690]
I don't know if you saw yesterday but both CNN and headline news they're appendage

[01:17:56.290 --> 01:18:01.090]
They both had a story about that right magazine story that Tom and Katie have split up

[01:18:01.090 --> 01:18:05.610]
About the vehement to mouse and guess what clip they showed on that story from South Park

[01:18:05.610 --> 01:18:09.250]
Oh did they? Oh yes in the closet clip or the other?

[01:18:09.290 --> 01:18:09.870]
That is correct

[01:18:11.330 --> 01:18:14.310]
And I just peed my pants out of so hard it was great

[01:18:15.090 --> 01:18:19.170]
Even the certainly nasty news network and they said all Tom's having some tough times these days

[01:18:19.170 --> 01:18:21.630]
Because everybody knows you're fairy

[01:18:21.630 --> 01:18:23.710]
You're in a closet Tom come on please

[01:18:23.710 --> 01:18:27.050]
Joe Bell puts out a couple of members first of all office hours

[01:18:27.050 --> 01:18:29.650]
Look at that 830 to 530 starting Tuesday the 20th

[01:18:29.650 --> 01:18:35.410]
That's good get some people in there and the status you know the more slack at all you like this is like in crap that goes on air

[01:18:35.410 --> 01:18:40.170]
And number two Ray Perry has rejoined WQM is sports sales manager

[01:18:40.170 --> 01:18:45.550]
He's got a total of 85 years with QM before leaving it years in before getting screwed over

[01:18:45.550 --> 01:18:49.530]
We'll be working with Chris Jones to assure we achieve WQM revenue goals

[01:18:49.530 --> 01:18:52.950]
In his position real be our primary contact with the sports teams

[01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:55.590]
He'll be in charge of our network's condition supervising the sports sellers

[01:18:55.590 --> 01:19:02.050]
We'll be selling key accounts himself Ray and his wife Rose and their 70 year old son Daniel reside in Plurid plantation

[01:19:02.050 --> 01:19:03.530]
Welcome them back to the QM family

[01:19:03.530 --> 01:19:07.070]
Well that's so he's a good guy Ray Perry and really know he does anyway he's a good guy

[01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:14.670]
Well he will be now but it's got a 70 year old son that that kind of takes me I know it's very fashionable now for old cockers to be having babies like Larry King

[01:19:14.670 --> 01:19:17.910]
Yeah and like Tony Randall did before he finally went to his dirt nap

[01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:21.390]
But Ray Perry just turned 85 and he got a 70 year old son let's hear it for Ray

[01:19:21.850 --> 01:19:28.990]
So it's not a bad idea we like Ray a lot he's a good guy and make sure I get those Panther tickets or whatever it is

[01:19:28.990 --> 01:19:31.710]
Yeah they're already asking for money by the way the Panthers do you know that?

[01:19:32.010 --> 01:19:32.670]
No I didn't

[01:19:32.670 --> 01:19:37.610]
Just got that we knew a notice for 2006 and 2007 for next season in the mail

[01:19:37.610 --> 01:19:40.470]
Oh yeah send us some money and we'll give it like 7,500 free tickets

[01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:45.370]
And we'll give you like a whole carton of condoms and a bunch of toothpaste and body wash

[01:19:45.370 --> 01:19:48.170]
Oh I got myself two new flavors yesterday three

[01:19:48.170 --> 01:19:48.910]
Really?

[01:19:48.910 --> 01:19:53.630]
Well that's remember I told him I started going to the drugstore and my sack fell when I slipped on the ice

[01:19:54.350 --> 01:20:00.130]
And I got let's see possessed has got a new one it's called Tangerine or Tango or some crap life

[01:20:00.130 --> 01:20:05.170]
That is really neat stuff all the one I opened it to smell and get the aroma of it I was in the shower

[01:20:05.170 --> 01:20:09.510]
And I farted real bad and so I'm like well I messed everything up you know

[01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:12.650]
So I had to close the container real fast because I want to miss anything good

[01:20:12.650 --> 01:20:16.450]
And then the other two are acts let me ask you if you check those out yeah

[01:20:16.450 --> 01:20:21.090]
I've seen the axes I've used them yeah but these are new ones these aren't in that black container these

[01:20:21.090 --> 01:20:22.990]
There's a green one and there's a blue one

[01:20:22.990 --> 01:20:23.510]
Yeah

[01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:28.830]
In other words they're transparent bottles and the other ones probably the ones you use is in a black bottle

[01:20:28.830 --> 01:20:32.410]
Yeah I go to the ones where the nozzles are kind of angled like a

[01:20:32.890 --> 01:20:36.470]
I've seen a few angled nozzles yeah so I'm thinking yeah they are

[01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:38.590]
That's the part of the investment they have angled nozzles

[01:20:38.590 --> 01:20:41.070]
Quite a bold cleaner there's another product that's what they're in there with me

[01:20:41.810 --> 01:20:44.790]
Anyway acts and they're pretty good I kind of sniffed them both

[01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:48.850]
Jason Leopold writes truth out dot org

[01:20:48.850 --> 01:20:53.570]
Gonzalez with holding claim emails why I got so much stuff that I feel very compelled

[01:20:53.570 --> 01:20:56.510]
Not as not as entertaining as that last caller but pretty good

[01:20:56.510 --> 01:21:04.290]
Sources close the investigation to Lincoln covert CIA agent Valerie Plain Wilson revealed this week that Attorney General Alberto V05 Gonzalez has not turned over

[01:21:04.290 --> 01:21:09.790]
Has not turned over emails to these special prosecutors or office they may incriminate Vice President Dick Cheney and Zayds

[01:21:09.930 --> 01:21:15.330]
Another White House officials who allegedly played an active role in unmasking claims Wilson identity to reporters

[01:21:15.330 --> 01:21:21.690]
Plain Wilson more over these sources said that in early 2004 Cheney was interviewed by federal prosecutors investigating the Plain Wilson leak

[01:21:21.690 --> 01:21:26.970]
And testified that neither he nor any of his senior agents were involved in unmasking her under cover CIA status to reporters

[01:21:26.970 --> 01:21:34.850]
And that no one in the Vice President's office had attempted to discredit her husband of vocal critic of the administration's peor iracking intelligence in other words smear and smear

[01:21:34.850 --> 01:21:39.130]
Cheney did not testify under author under penalty of purgey when he was interviewed by federal prosecutors

[01:21:39.130 --> 01:21:45.250]
The emails Gonzalez is sent to be withholding contained references to Valerie Plain Wilson's identity and CIA status

[01:21:45.250 --> 01:21:50.010]
And developments related to the inability to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq more over

[01:21:50.010 --> 01:21:57.510]
However according to sources the emails contained suggestions by the officials now the White House should respond to what it believed were increasingly destructive comments

[01:21:57.510 --> 01:22:03.550]
The Joseph Wilson they've been making about the administration's pre-war Iraq intelligence smear and smear

[01:22:03.550 --> 01:22:09.670]
I mean why does it have to have all these committees? I mean anybody with an IQ over four can see what that was going on

[01:22:09.670 --> 01:22:14.590]
Yes, well the committee has a national security or the safety of the CIA people write this other crap

[01:22:14.590 --> 01:22:18.370]
It's all smear and smear man just like Nixon with the enemies with the same craft

[01:22:18.370 --> 01:22:24.670]
We're gonna smear him and smear him and if we have to out her in the meantime that's the way to work and to score you know that would be

[01:22:24.670 --> 01:22:31.870]

[01:22:38.250 --> 01:22:45.890]
The truck driver said fat doing part to increase quarter for ad spending the countered Stern's January debut on rival series

[01:22:46.490 --> 01:22:54.130]
XM's quarter for net loss rose from 190 190 million a year ago to 270 million in fact the increased spending

[01:22:54.130 --> 01:23:01.730]
Drill of XM subscriber acquisition cost from 64 bucks a customer in quarter for 2004 to 89 dollars in quarter for 2005

[01:23:01.730 --> 01:23:06.890]
However, their CEO Hugh Panero said during yesterday morning earnings conference called the company maintained

[01:23:07.870 --> 01:23:12.970]

[01:23:21.370 --> 01:23:28.850]
Warnings about the company spending are going on heard given current course and speed there is in my view a significant chance of a crisis on the horizon

[01:23:28.850 --> 01:23:36.170]
Robert said this is that xm even absent of crisis. I believe that xm will inevitably service your holders poorly without major changes now

[01:23:36.830 --> 01:23:40.910]
I've been troubled about the current direction the company don't believe that it's in the best interest of the company shareholders

[01:23:40.910 --> 01:23:47.970]
I've made my an an utilization of observation zone and increasingly vociferous mannered the board and a number of senior managers of the company

[01:23:47.970 --> 01:23:53.590]
I'm not having any useful effect and I care too much and believe my own views too much to just go along for the ride

[01:23:53.590 --> 01:24:00.470]
He's out I like that Roberts is also the chairman of data management from telefia or telefia

[01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:05.610]
So there you go he's out there. I said screw on me said they want to send me to spend a money like my conciders

[01:24:05.610 --> 01:24:07.970]
Stern is not going to block off and etsy into them

So if you want to hear Oprah by all means and if you drive a big Mac a big Mac and a big truck go out there and get that

Oh, there's another story about the missing whip it you know people are dying like with lies in Iraq and we got all these abuse stories

And the constitution been shredded like a piece of Swiss cheese and they're worried about a lost whip it at the airport there in New York

[01:24:24.490 --> 01:24:28.230]
They got a big search. Oh, they called off the search for the poor little doggy

[01:24:28.230 --> 01:24:29.890]
What was she doing 25?

[01:24:30.130 --> 01:24:35.870]
Well, I don't know. Whipits are known for their speed. Vivi apparently panicked and though one way

[01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:39.950]
I should be fine. Maybe she'll find a good home where they won't like use her like some kind of a

[01:24:39.950 --> 01:24:41.810]

To decide whether to accept the five-year prison sentence or risk life behind bars if convicted of having sex with an 11-year-old student

[01:24:56.230 --> 01:24:57.890]
How come we haven't heard this story before?

[01:24:58.430 --> 01:24:59.870]

[01:24:59.870 --> 01:25:02.810]
When you were reading all the stories? Right. Yeah, no.

[01:25:02.810 --> 01:25:11.270]
And he heard yesterday circuit judge Lucy Chernobyl Brown asked prosecutor Jennifer million to disclose the plea offer which includes 10 years of sex offender probation after prison

[01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:19.750]
Five years that would require Flanagan 51 to adhere to a curfew submit to warrantless searches and for better for being within a thousand feet of a school day care center

[01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:26.830]
Or anywhere the children are known to congregate. She would also be a registered sex offender. The plea offer received the blessing of the lives victim and his family million said

[01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:35.770]
If convicted as charged of capital sexual battery Flanagan faces a mandatory life sentence for attorney Ken Rohn can be reached by phone for comments is this come

The son settled is not identified. Legs victims of sex abuse that says here the boy in his siblings offense

Then I did Flanagan's book a home where much of the sex took place according to court documents 11 years old

[01:25:52.050 --> 01:25:58.470]
It's not a second middle school at least the child is testified that a sexual encounter is occurred in Flanagan's classroom a

Lantana Park in Orlando Hotel room and in the teachers van in a several air patrol parking lot the boy told authorities that he

Inflanting in kiss to her orifice and a storage room at the Boyton Beach School

[01:26:07.810 --> 01:26:15.070]
He also claimed that Flanagan's husband Douglas Depew witnessed the alleged sex including sharing a bed with the two of them that ignored it

[01:26:15.070 --> 01:26:19.250]
Depew is denied having any knowledge of his wife's purported involvement with the boy last summer

[01:26:19.250 --> 01:26:26.470]
Depew's insurance company state farm settled a one and a half million dollar claim brought by the child and his father was also admitted having a sexual relationship with Flanagan

[01:26:27.250 --> 01:26:27.690]

Law suits against the Palm Beach County School Board and the Civil Air Patrol are pending

[01:26:44.250 --> 01:26:50.730]
The plea offer according to the prosecutor was extended an effort to protect the victim as much as possible her gender makes absolutely no difference whatsoever

[01:26:51.250 --> 01:26:52.070]

[01:40:05.130 --> 01:40:14.250]
unnoticed like an art it's all about egg-biting and you die of disease they throw the body in the sea

[01:41:09.350 --> 01:41:13.950]
absolutely not watch like broke ass mountain for example and speaking of that yeah little

[01:41:13.950 --> 01:41:19.170]
this harmony going on there does there see I want to preface this by saying all this and I

[01:41:19.170 --> 01:41:23.210]
granted I only watched half the movie but all this big simmiss about Heath Ledger and his great

[01:41:23.210 --> 01:41:27.190]
acting well let me tell you this he may be a great actor but it sure wasn't because of anything

[01:41:27.190 --> 01:41:32.430]
he didn't that movie because he was he was as wooden as a totem pole I mean he was just

[01:41:32.430 --> 01:41:37.090]
you know down an expression was it into the role that you're about to do a little bit you know

[01:41:37.830 --> 01:41:43.350]

[01:42:39.330 --> 01:42:43.190]
about the pizza you know you know how it is when you tangle with sausage Heath Ledger surprised

[01:42:43.190 --> 01:42:47.070]
the packed Berlin film festival news conference went to that when he remarked that he believes George

[01:42:47.070 --> 01:42:52.410]
Clooney deserves the best supporting actor Oscar this year for his performance in Seriana I'll get

[01:42:52.410 --> 01:42:56.870]
back to you Seriana Jake Hillenall who appeared in Prokback Mountain with Ledger who himself was

[01:42:56.870 --> 01:43:01.870]
nominated for best actor Oscar is also one of the best supporting actor nominees Ledger's remark

[01:43:01.870 --> 01:43:05.410]
came after reporter no to that Clooney had told an earlier news conference at the festival

[01:43:05.410 --> 01:43:09.530]
that he didn't expect to win any of the three categories for which he been nominated he's also

[01:43:09.530 --> 01:43:14.050]
nominated for director and screenplay categories for good night and good luck adding there's been a

[01:43:14.050 --> 01:43:18.750]
lot of uh broke back mountain stuff whatever that means Ledger appearing at the festival to promote

[01:43:18.750 --> 01:43:23.470]
his latest film the Australian produced candy expressed a life that he'd been able to make five

[01:43:23.470 --> 01:43:27.970]
films back to back over the past year and credited director Terry Killian for showcasing his

[01:43:27.970 --> 01:43:32.490]
talents in the brother grim thereby opening up more interesting choices for him he said he found

[01:43:32.490 --> 01:43:36.830]
that working on Australia on candy incredibly liberate it was incredibly liberating in the sense

[01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:40.950]
of it the first film I've done to use my own accent in about eight years he said one one reporter asked

[01:43:40.950 --> 01:43:44.830]
what the difference was for him to be making love to a woman in one film and woman in another he

[01:43:44.830 --> 01:43:52.230]
replied the stubble to which we were told what is that yeah the stubble well he didn't say

[01:43:52.230 --> 01:43:55.590]
where the stubble was you know I say not the first thing how do you like that so he's given a little

[01:43:55.590 --> 01:44:01.370]
stucco to Jake Gillianoff I guess he's probably PO you know and I really don't know which one killed

[01:44:01.370 --> 01:44:05.010]
which one film the movie so maybe that has something to do with it one of them killed the other one

[01:44:05.010 --> 01:44:09.710]
right and if you think I'm ever gonna watch you into that movie man it would take a lot of cash

[01:44:09.710 --> 01:44:14.330]
I'd rather watch say nothing even even it's got like even if it owes two stars I think that's

[01:44:14.330 --> 01:44:18.970]
the only way you're gonna find out what what's all about oh yeah because you listen to other people

[01:49:18.110 --> 01:49:26.810]
you know the young man and that whole killer he's cool in his heels baby

[01:49:28.290 --> 01:49:32.350]

[01:49:35.370 --> 01:49:40.550]
hey keep going these are great oh they are I'm gonna take about 4,000 I'm I may just hold off my

[01:49:40.550 --> 01:49:45.470]
pole although I got a really good article by Eric Ultraman called the gas bag gap oh it's good

[01:49:45.470 --> 01:49:49.150]
those sound effects are there documents your Maryland to hell election and primary on

[01:49:49.150 --> 01:49:54.150]
I'm certified illegal die-bold hooding machines I just I got so much good stuff but you're right the

[01:49:54.150 --> 01:49:57.810]
calls are ready and that's the meat and potatoes man the bread and butter that's the head cheese

[01:49:57.810 --> 01:50:03.530]
this is Neil Roger and it's Miller this is five six oh like me

[01:50:05.870 --> 01:50:07.790]
Friday you bastard

[01:50:07.790 --> 01:50:15.030]
and now the show that's the antidote to those liberal media distortions of our government

[01:50:15.470 --> 01:50:22.470]
it's the West Texas wing my fellow Americans I come before you tonight to explain why it's okay

[01:50:22.470 --> 01:50:29.430]
for me to easy drop on your telephone conversations you see I only listen to the calls of suspected

[01:50:29.430 --> 01:50:35.370]
outkiter terrorists I'd never listen to the calls of good honest godfair and patriotic Americans

[01:50:35.370 --> 01:50:41.410]
oh oh by the way if Betty Dubois from Pueblo Colorado is watching tonight your husband's cheating on

[01:50:41.410 --> 01:50:45.870]
you with your sister and that nice guy who just moved in across the street he ain't divorced

[01:50:45.870 --> 01:50:51.190]
he's gay but but there's nothing wrong with that you know unless he's a cowboy come back next time

[01:50:51.190 --> 01:50:57.150]
for a fair imbalance compassionally conservative view of our government and action only on

[01:50:57.150 --> 01:51:04.410]
the West Texas wing 1233 27 to 1 a.m. US history judge Marsha Cook refused to set bond today a bond

[01:51:04.410 --> 01:51:09.710]
today for accused terrorists Jose Padilla who used to be Jose Padilla but now he's Jose Padilla

[01:51:10.350 --> 01:51:13.550]
Padilla's lawyers had challenges pre-trial detention and requested that the alleged

[01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:17.110]
jail cutoff would be allowed to stay as mothers Rauer County condo

[01:51:17.810 --> 01:51:22.750]
under 24 hour house arrest cubic defender Michael Caruso argued that Padilla never trained in

[01:51:22.750 --> 01:51:26.670]
any terrorist training camp as the government has alleged and he's not a danger of the community

[01:51:26.670 --> 01:51:30.530]
moreover Padilla's defenceless said the federal magistrate ordered pre-trial detention

[01:51:30.530 --> 01:51:34.350]
should have considered Padilla's three and a half year detention military custody is an enemy

[01:51:34.890 --> 01:51:39.010]
combatant but a beat but a boop but a bomb trial the schedule will begin early September for Padilla

[01:51:39.010 --> 01:51:44.790]
who was charged along with four other men as being a dirty bomb uh slimeball I'ma said deba

[01:51:44.790 --> 01:51:56.910]
can't say deba it's in deba we can't say deba that's what most do do do do do do do do do do do

[01:51:56.910 --> 01:52:01.870]
I am a psych man to do that Eric Alderman writes mainstream reporters tend to see both liberal and

[01:52:01.870 --> 01:52:05.890]
right wing critics as a bunch of winters who just don't get it and in many cases they're right

[01:52:05.890 --> 01:52:10.710]
but being mainstream reporters they tend to believe nay know that they're always right in fact journalism

[01:52:10.710 --> 01:52:15.030]
is just about the only field whose practitioners routinely justify themselves on the basis of the

[01:52:15.030 --> 01:52:19.710]
fact that they receive criticism from both sides the possibility that they might be screwing up in two

[01:52:19.710 --> 01:52:24.550]
or more ways simultaneously appears to be beyond their imaginative capabilities during the past

[01:52:24.550 --> 01:52:28.730]
generation these same mainstream journalists have lurched to the right thanks in large measure

[01:52:28.730 --> 01:52:32.970]
to an extremely well-funded well organized and well disciplined conservative political assault

[01:52:32.970 --> 01:52:37.450]
compromising essentially two tactics a willingness and ability to make life miserable for those who

[01:52:37.450 --> 01:52:41.830]
don't go along and a determination to shape the zeitgeist in such a way that those who do go along

[01:52:41.830 --> 01:52:45.650]
may not even know that they're doing it in other words what Tony Siprano cannot accomplish

[01:52:45.650 --> 01:52:50.330]
leave to Antonio Gramsci while most fair minded observers ought to agree with the above especially

[01:52:50.330 --> 01:52:55.550]
in lot of the rise of the far right media empire of Rupert rush or Riley talk radio etc it's still

[01:52:55.550 --> 01:53:00.210]
pretty difficult to prove most academic studies of media content are compromised because even with

[01:53:00.210 --> 01:53:04.850]
the best intentions it's impossible to control for independent political variables as as for the

[01:53:04.850 --> 01:53:09.150]
decades old studies purporting the show that reporters vote democratic when not by us in the first

[01:53:09.150 --> 01:53:13.010]
place they tell us nothing about the content of the news a number of Rupert Murdoch's top of the

[01:53:13.010 --> 01:53:17.330]
tenants came to be liberal democrats a lot that matters and remember this study does not include

[01:53:18.490 --> 01:53:23.490]
fox covered all this is reason to welcome the new study by david brox media matters for america

[01:53:23.490 --> 01:53:29.510]
hey david do fairy titled if it's Sunday it's conservative mma conducted a content analysis of

[01:53:29.510 --> 01:53:34.570]
ABC's this week with jord step on top of us CBS's face the nation with okey dokey and NBC's

[01:53:34.570 --> 01:53:40.110]
eat the press with a red face to goofball tim rusher classifying each one of the nearly 7000 guests

[01:53:40.110 --> 01:53:45.410]
from bill Clinton's second term George w wishes first term and 2005 is either democrat republican

[01:53:45.410 --> 01:53:49.870]
conservative progressive or neutral it's key finding the balance between democrats sliced

[01:53:49.870 --> 01:53:53.970]
progressives and republican slash conservatives was roughly equal during Clinton's second term

[01:53:53.970 --> 01:53:59.050]
with a slight edge toward republican slash conservatives 52% of the ideological identifiable

[01:53:59.050 --> 01:54:04.450]
guess were from the right 48% from the left but in bush's first term republican slash conservatives

[01:54:04.450 --> 01:54:10.390]
held a dramatic advantage outnumbering democrats sliced progressive 58 to 42% in 2005 the figures

[01:54:10.390 --> 01:54:16.570]
went identical 58 to 42% for the Nazis in addition more panels tilted right a number of republican

[01:54:16.570 --> 01:54:20.190]
a greater number of republican conservatives and democrat progressive been tilted led for every

[01:54:20.190 --> 01:54:25.030]
single year of the study in some years the gap was as high as four to one more over congressional

[01:54:25.030 --> 01:54:29.210]
opponents of the rack war were all but banished from the sunday shows especially in the period

[01:54:29.210 --> 01:54:33.270]
just before was launched when supposed people for the shows were contacted to explain this to

[01:54:33.270 --> 01:54:37.570]
the disparity they claimed that they go where the action is and today the action is republican

[01:54:37.570 --> 01:54:41.490]
slash conservative which should be noted that face the nation was considerably fair than meet the

[01:54:41.490 --> 01:54:46.970]
press or this week but of course were that true then the Clinton years would have been just

[01:54:46.970 --> 01:54:50.770]
until the favored democrat progressives as the bush years have been toward republican conservatives

[01:54:50.770 --> 01:54:54.870]
but of course they're not even close think about it the show is still empowered to engage in a

[01:54:54.870 --> 01:54:58.870]
devastating discussion with the panel of mostly right wing politicians followed by a journalist

[01:54:58.870 --> 01:55:03.070]
panel which conservatives are paired almost exclusively with down the middle reporters rather than

[01:55:03.070 --> 01:55:07.230]
a writer or thinker who might credibly represent the liberal side every week a politically newter

[01:55:07.230 --> 01:55:11.670]
jord step on top of a six the wisdom of the deeply right wing jorge will and the neutral though

[01:55:11.670 --> 01:55:16.530]
personally conservative for reads a carrier with no balance whatsoever sandalos in a liberal

[01:55:16.530 --> 01:55:19.850]
who previously was accepted as rule though no liberal i know would have picked him to represent

[01:55:19.850 --> 01:55:24.330]
our side the guest list for the far more influential meet the press tells a similar story

[01:55:24.330 --> 01:55:29.010]
why ask the ma studies author paul walden with the producers of the shows believe that a William

[01:55:29.010 --> 01:55:35.530]
sapphire 56 appearances since 97 or Bob Novak 37 appearances is somehow balanced by Gwen i feel

[01:55:35.530 --> 01:55:40.990]
with 27 or Dan vaults with 22 what's more despite having been produced by liberal think tank the

[01:55:40.990 --> 01:55:45.250]
studies grading of the guests where the rubber hits the road is extremely generous to the right

[01:55:45.250 --> 01:55:49.230]
wing side and therefore precludes any credible complaints that it's a product of liberal bias

[01:55:49.230 --> 01:55:54.170]
for instance liberal hater joe cline together with war supporters peter binaid and jorge packer

[01:55:54.170 --> 01:55:58.790]
coated progressive and koki robertson david broder who openly detest both fit and and gore

[01:55:58.790 --> 01:56:03.290]
while frequently apologizing for boy together with former ge chairman jack welch and missus

[01:56:03.290 --> 01:56:08.030]
alan greenspan and via michael were classified as neutral remember how quickly michael how quick

[01:56:08.030 --> 01:56:11.770]
michael was during the two thousand four debates recused carry of demagoguery for during the

[01:56:11.770 --> 01:56:16.270]
criticized her husband alan greenspan indeed as far as critical commentary goes with the occasional

[01:56:16.270 --> 01:56:21.150]
exception of ej deon there's not a single on apologetic liberal on any of these shows save for

[01:56:21.150 --> 01:56:25.670]
us and annual appearance as a kind of anthropological curiosity tune into every show every week

[01:56:25.670 --> 01:56:30.050]
for a year in your unlikely to see frank rich paul kerman rich rich hurtsberg herald mire center

[01:56:30.050 --> 01:56:34.390]
anyone associated with the nation the american prospect of watching monthly new york review of books

[01:56:34.390 --> 01:56:39.050]
salon in these times mother jones or even the liberal remnant inside the new republic when you

[01:56:39.050 --> 01:56:42.790]
think about it say tribute to the american people that the remain as receptive to liberal arguments

[01:56:42.790 --> 01:56:47.650]
as they do given how infrequently they hear any of them how do you like that that's what arick alderman

[01:56:47.650 --> 01:56:53.530]

[01:58:11.490 --> 01:58:12.110]

[01:58:20.710 --> 01:58:26.230]
who smells it there this has always been my style

[01:58:26.230 --> 01:58:26.830]
excellent

[01:58:26.830 --> 01:58:30.710]
me

[01:58:56.230 --> 01:58:58.790]
The sweet smell of my food

[01:58:59.430 --> 01:59:02.870]
You don't like what you're telling me

[01:59:02.870 --> 01:59:05.530]
But it's sweet to me

[01:59:06.070 --> 01:59:07.510]
The sin to my father

[01:59:09.430 --> 01:59:15.290]
And he was an empty day

[01:59:20.770 --> 01:59:23.470]
Oh speaking of that

[01:59:24.090 --> 01:59:27.670]
Last week I'm sitting in Woodbuy and there was a young lady who sat down next to me

[01:59:27.670 --> 01:59:30.370]
I swear to you some I don't know where she is from

[01:59:30.370 --> 01:59:32.190]
You've voiced me not some Asian bitch

[01:59:32.190 --> 01:59:35.590]
She sat down next to me and I swear to you far would be an understatement

[01:59:35.590 --> 01:59:37.610]
I think it may have been a lot more serious than that

[01:59:37.610 --> 01:59:41.190]
And just and I sat there I thought for sure I was going to swoon

[01:59:41.190 --> 01:59:43.390]
I mean it's and it just kept getting more and more intense

[01:59:43.390 --> 01:59:47.170]
And usually if you just hold your breath and I put your head off to the side

[01:59:47.170 --> 01:59:50.230]
It'll dissipate after a few seconds and you'll oh thank god

[01:59:50.230 --> 01:59:56.110]
This just kept getting more and more intense which indicates to me that it may have been a little more serious than just a little

[01:59:56.110 --> 01:59:57.850]
Gantt maybe it's a blessing to you

[01:59:57.850 --> 01:59:59.910]
Perhaps a little Hershey Kins back there

[02:00:05.690 --> 02:00:06.730]
Maybe a rosebud

[02:00:07.350 --> 02:00:09.130]
And this guy likes to miss a good bar

[02:00:09.130 --> 02:00:09.490]
Okay

[02:00:09.970 --> 02:00:10.870]
Maybe that's the one

[02:00:10.870 --> 02:00:13.670]
I think you want to see Mr. Goodwrench

[02:00:15.490 --> 02:00:18.250]
Anyway Tracy in Kendall says this is a sad facts

[02:00:18.250 --> 02:00:21.530]
One question about the pull is the worst ending the same as the saddest

[02:00:21.530 --> 02:00:22.410]
No not really

[02:00:22.410 --> 02:00:26.510]
Because if we would have said the saddest in American history

[02:00:26.510 --> 02:00:27.690]
X would have been on there right

[02:00:27.690 --> 02:00:29.330]
Right that was the person

[02:00:29.330 --> 02:00:30.210]
That's the first one

[02:00:30.210 --> 02:00:32.550]
So I have a couple of nominations long lines of million dollar baby

[02:00:32.550 --> 02:00:34.490]
Which I want to because you were George revealed ending

[02:00:34.490 --> 02:00:35.630]
Must have enjoyed that and see it

[02:00:35.630 --> 02:00:37.950]
My nominations are the House of Sand and Fog

[02:00:37.950 --> 02:00:39.810]
Right very much along those lines

[02:00:39.810 --> 02:00:41.390]
Along with Sad or Bad

[02:00:41.390 --> 02:00:43.130]
Sad and pointless

[02:00:43.130 --> 02:00:45.050]
Like why are you getting me involved with all these characters' lives

[02:00:45.050 --> 02:00:45.750]
Just a rip mic

[02:00:45.750 --> 02:00:47.870]
The sun gets inadvertently shot by the pull

[02:00:47.870 --> 02:00:48.910]
East the parents kill themselves

[02:00:48.910 --> 02:00:50.390]
And yet her colleague goes to jail

[02:00:50.390 --> 02:00:51.090]
And for rent

[02:00:51.090 --> 02:00:53.450]
With its ending full of addiction and death from AIDS

[02:00:53.450 --> 02:00:55.970]
Both let me literally depress for hours afterward

[02:00:55.970 --> 02:00:56.930]
Rent is it right

[02:00:56.930 --> 02:00:58.070]
Everybody has AIDS

[02:00:58.070 --> 02:00:59.550]
Yeah yeah yeah

[02:00:59.550 --> 02:01:00.370]
Tracy said

[02:01:00.370 --> 02:01:02.190]
Not to get sad face you says

[02:01:02.190 --> 02:01:04.330]
But I'm one lady listening with things you and George are the greatest

[02:01:04.330 --> 02:01:05.930]
I appreciate how you keep me informed and entertain

[02:01:05.930 --> 02:01:09.090]
Last week it was time to put my 15 and a half year old golden retriever

[02:01:09.090 --> 02:01:09.890]
Hobbs to sleep

[02:01:09.890 --> 02:01:11.850]
And listening to you help keep my spirits up

[02:01:11.850 --> 02:01:13.550]
And even life on such a mild calling day thanks

[02:01:13.550 --> 02:01:16.230]
Very sorry Tracy because there ain't nothing like a golden retriever there

[02:01:16.230 --> 02:01:18.270]
Better than most human beings I've met my life

[02:01:18.270 --> 02:01:18.890]
Yeah trust me

[02:01:18.890 --> 02:01:20.030]
So I'm sorry about that

[02:01:20.030 --> 02:01:21.870]
But the thing that is got to get you a new one right away

[02:01:23.430 --> 02:01:24.070]
I'm not there

[02:01:24.070 --> 02:01:25.090]
If I could have

[02:01:25.090 --> 02:01:25.990]
Well I wouldn't want it

[02:01:26.370 --> 02:01:27.510]
It's too much responsibility

[02:01:27.510 --> 02:01:29.750]
Especially for an old man like me that keeps falling down

[02:01:29.750 --> 02:01:30.090]
You know

[02:01:30.090 --> 02:01:30.670]
But

[02:01:31.410 --> 02:01:32.570]
If I could have pets

[02:01:32.570 --> 02:01:33.530]
You know I'd probably give me a dog

[02:01:33.530 --> 02:01:34.830]
A little dog

[02:01:34.830 --> 02:01:36.650]
Like another minpin like tiny

[02:01:36.650 --> 02:01:37.110]
Not effect

[02:01:37.110 --> 02:01:38.570]
Why don't you get yourself a dog sled

[02:01:38.570 --> 02:01:39.810]
And you want it to worry about falling down

[02:01:39.810 --> 02:01:40.550]
That's a good idea

[02:01:40.550 --> 02:01:41.290]
You know seriously

[02:01:41.290 --> 02:01:42.790]
That's the first time in my life

[02:01:42.790 --> 02:01:44.790]
I'm a hundred years old and that's the first time I've ever been

[02:01:45.470 --> 02:01:47.010]
Outdoors where you couldn't walk

[02:01:47.010 --> 02:01:48.010]
I mean I'm not joking

[02:01:48.010 --> 02:01:48.290]
Oh you

[02:01:48.290 --> 02:01:49.310]
They're got that

[02:01:49.310 --> 02:01:49.990]
The ice was like

[02:01:49.990 --> 02:01:50.810]
Uh huh

[02:01:50.810 --> 02:01:52.110]
Like flickering and snot

[02:01:52.110 --> 02:01:53.470]
Yeah exactly

[02:01:53.470 --> 02:01:53.870]
Yeah

[02:01:53.870 --> 02:01:54.730]
Look at that snot

[02:01:54.730 --> 02:01:56.270]
It's not a sidewall but it's not

[02:01:56.270 --> 02:01:56.990]
Frequently yeah

[02:01:56.990 --> 02:01:58.550]
Good God it was banned

[02:01:58.550 --> 02:02:00.250]
And the old man extends this hand

[02:02:00.250 --> 02:02:01.130]
And we could take my hand

[02:02:01.130 --> 02:02:01.730]
I don't know

[02:02:01.730 --> 02:02:03.290]
I don't want to take your hand pal

[02:02:03.290 --> 02:02:04.110]
They get

[02:02:06.370 --> 02:02:08.490]
But isn't that typical of these people

[02:02:08.490 --> 02:02:09.370]
It's just being a nice guy

[02:02:09.370 --> 02:02:10.090]
It picks up the items

[02:02:10.090 --> 02:02:11.010]
I fell out of my bag

[02:02:11.010 --> 02:02:11.890]
I opened up the sack

[02:02:11.890 --> 02:02:12.830]
He put them back in the very

[02:02:12.830 --> 02:02:14.810]
And I was wondering to myself

[02:02:14.810 --> 02:02:16.310]
How come this old guy is standing

[02:02:16.310 --> 02:02:16.630]
You know

[02:02:16.630 --> 02:02:17.830]
How come he's moving around

[02:02:17.830 --> 02:02:18.750]
And he's not flopping down

[02:02:18.750 --> 02:02:20.070]
Maybe he had gulashes on or something

[02:02:20.070 --> 02:02:21.390]
He probably has some grippy shoes

[02:02:21.390 --> 02:02:22.350]
There you go

[02:02:22.350 --> 02:02:24.090]
W-A-M had a maybe teeth

[02:02:24.090 --> 02:02:25.010]
Q-A-M hello

[02:02:25.010 --> 02:02:26.090]
Hello, Neil, how are you

[02:02:26.090 --> 02:02:26.590]
Good

[02:02:26.590 --> 02:02:28.090]
You're doing a good job today pal

[02:02:28.090 --> 02:02:29.850]
I'm always doing a good job sir

[02:02:29.850 --> 02:02:30.250]
I'm sure

[02:02:30.250 --> 02:02:31.250]
Just asking how

[02:02:31.670 --> 02:02:32.990]
The biggest heartbreaker

[02:02:32.990 --> 02:02:34.610]
The ending of the movie is a terminal

[02:02:34.610 --> 02:02:36.990]
I just thought that he was going to get the woman

[02:02:36.990 --> 02:02:39.090]
And I just thought it was going to be beautiful

[02:02:39.090 --> 02:02:40.210]
But it was that one

[02:02:40.210 --> 02:02:40.870]
Yeah

[02:02:40.870 --> 02:02:42.250]
You know Tom Hanks

[02:02:42.250 --> 02:02:44.370]
No, I wouldn't see a Tom Hanks movie if you'd been

[02:02:44.370 --> 02:02:46.750]
I got a tragic beginning when I started

[02:02:46.750 --> 02:02:47.910]
And I thought it was Tom Hanks

[02:02:47.910 --> 02:02:48.450]
Oh yeah

[02:02:48.450 --> 02:02:49.750]
That always ended for me

[02:02:49.750 --> 02:02:51.570]
And then for all you football fans

[02:02:51.570 --> 02:02:52.410]
Friday night lights

[02:02:52.410 --> 02:02:53.390]
Just a terrible ending

[02:02:53.390 --> 02:02:53.990]
Okay

[02:02:53.990 --> 02:02:55.130]
Or just a terrible

[02:02:55.130 --> 02:02:56.410]
Okay, thanks paly

[02:02:56.410 --> 02:02:57.030]
Thanks Neil

[02:02:57.630 --> 02:02:58.530]
What do you mean just terrible?

[02:02:58.610 --> 02:02:59.450]
You saw a football movie

[02:02:59.450 --> 02:03:00.890]
I saw a football movie

[02:03:00.890 --> 02:03:01.410]
Oh no

[02:03:01.410 --> 02:03:01.890]
And it sucked

[02:03:01.890 --> 02:03:02.230]
Why

[02:03:02.230 --> 02:03:03.270]
It was armed

[02:03:03.270 --> 02:03:05.350]
I mean you're a guy that won't watch a football game

[02:03:05.350 --> 02:03:06.370]
Why would you watch a football game

[02:03:06.370 --> 02:03:07.650]
I don't want to lose my games

[02:03:07.650 --> 02:03:08.730]
But I will watch movies

[02:03:08.730 --> 02:03:09.450]
You see

[02:03:09.450 --> 02:03:11.730]
About people playing games

[02:03:11.730 --> 02:03:13.350]
And that's the important part of the movie

[02:03:13.350 --> 02:03:14.030]
You want to take golf

[02:03:14.030 --> 02:03:15.310]
But maybe you watch golf on TV

[02:03:15.310 --> 02:03:16.350]
Now you're going to finally admit

[02:03:16.350 --> 02:03:17.650]
You have the closet on that

[02:03:17.650 --> 02:03:18.170]
No

[02:03:18.170 --> 02:03:18.710]
No

[02:03:18.710 --> 02:03:18.910]
No

[02:03:18.910 --> 02:03:19.590]
It's a movie

[02:03:19.590 --> 02:03:20.290]
You understand it

[02:03:20.290 --> 02:03:20.710]
It's a movie

[02:03:20.710 --> 02:03:22.030]
And the fourth part of the club

[02:03:22.030 --> 02:03:23.250]
The club is the jack Nicholas story

[02:03:23.250 --> 02:03:23.930]
You'll go and see that

[02:03:23.930 --> 02:03:24.770]
The time you go to the store

[02:03:24.770 --> 02:03:25.590]
I'm going to get

[02:03:25.590 --> 02:03:26.370]
A movie about golf

[02:03:26.370 --> 02:03:26.590]
Right

[02:03:26.590 --> 02:03:28.610]
I'm going to camp out to get the tickets for it

[02:03:28.610 --> 02:03:28.910]
Right

[02:03:28.910 --> 02:03:30.290]
I'm going to tell the people

[02:03:30.290 --> 02:03:31.350]
You know what I'm going to see that

[02:03:31.350 --> 02:03:32.870]
What about the Eddie Koalor story

[02:03:32.870 --> 02:03:33.310]
By the way

[02:03:33.310 --> 02:03:34.390]
The movie Friday night lights

[02:03:34.390 --> 02:03:35.230]
What about the Volmar story

[02:03:35.230 --> 02:03:35.630]
What about

[02:03:35.630 --> 02:03:37.270]
I can go see the Bob Volmar story

[02:03:38.410 --> 02:03:39.910]
Bob Volmar was a driver at

[02:03:39.910 --> 02:03:41.830]
The Potato Downs in Buffalo, Raceway

[02:03:41.830 --> 02:03:43.810]
Dick Fienberg will tell you all about Bob Volmar

[02:03:44.810 --> 02:03:46.210]
He'd open up about 15 lights

[02:03:46.210 --> 02:03:47.170]
Leading the backstretch

[02:03:47.170 --> 02:03:48.270]
And in the stretch

[02:03:48.270 --> 02:03:50.230]
They'd have to bring out a tank of oxygen

[02:03:50.230 --> 02:03:51.670]
For the horse and the driver

[02:03:53.090 --> 02:03:54.670]
That's called puking in the stretch

[02:03:54.670 --> 02:03:55.730]
What is that that you're playing

[02:03:55.730 --> 02:03:57.170]
It sounds like once upon a time in America

[02:03:57.170 --> 02:03:58.850]
Close, it's Andy in pipe music

[02:03:58.850 --> 02:04:00.410]
But that's made by Andy

[02:04:00.410 --> 02:04:01.470]
I'm never the scene

[02:04:01.470 --> 02:04:01.810]
Yes

[02:04:02.310 --> 02:04:03.810]
It was an opium trip

[02:04:03.810 --> 02:04:05.270]
You just wasted four and a half hours

[02:04:05.270 --> 02:04:06.670]
If you watch the unexpergated version

[02:04:06.670 --> 02:04:08.070]
Once upon a time in America

[02:04:08.070 --> 02:04:08.910]
It's a great movie though

[02:04:08.910 --> 02:04:09.370]
Noodles

[02:04:09.370 --> 02:04:10.530]
It's a great movie

[02:04:10.530 --> 02:04:11.010]
That really

[02:04:11.010 --> 02:04:12.050]
Every time I think of noodles

[02:04:12.050 --> 02:04:13.210]
It's a long movie

[02:04:13.210 --> 02:04:14.950]
You don't think it's a great movie

[02:04:14.950 --> 02:04:15.870]
No I thought it was adequate

[02:04:15.870 --> 02:04:16.830]
But it's just way too long

[02:04:16.830 --> 02:04:17.870]
Oh my god

[02:04:17.870 --> 02:04:19.050]
Addiquit my ass

[02:04:19.590 --> 02:04:20.410]
That's not what I heard

[02:04:20.410 --> 02:04:21.550]
No you're confusing it with

[02:04:21.550 --> 02:04:23.050]
That one with Dale Puccino

[02:04:23.050 --> 02:04:23.770]
Dog Day F Newy

[02:04:23.770 --> 02:04:24.310]
It's Addiquit

[02:04:24.970 --> 02:04:26.190]
He said way with the Hanky

[02:04:26.190 --> 02:04:26.850]
Addiquit

[02:04:26.850 --> 02:04:27.110]
Everything

[02:04:27.110 --> 02:04:28.230]
It took me three tries

[02:04:28.230 --> 02:04:29.770]
To get through the long version of it

[02:04:29.770 --> 02:04:30.610]
And then he said

[02:04:30.610 --> 02:04:32.030]
I'm dying on my face

[02:04:32.030 --> 02:04:32.690]
So now two

[02:04:32.690 --> 02:04:33.770]
That's what I went

[02:04:33.770 --> 02:04:34.890]
That's what I had to endure

[02:04:34.890 --> 02:04:36.610]
Is it because it's to that

[02:04:36.610 --> 02:04:37.150]
To get through

[02:04:37.150 --> 02:04:39.330]
And as you didn't like when James Woods got ground up

[02:04:39.330 --> 02:04:40.490]
In the garbage truck at the end

[02:04:40.490 --> 02:04:41.970]
There were a lot of things I liked about the movie

[02:04:41.970 --> 02:04:42.610]
All the way through

[02:04:42.610 --> 02:04:43.270]
But as a whole

[02:04:43.270 --> 02:04:45.450]
I didn't like the thing where he calls him

[02:04:45.450 --> 02:04:46.290]
You know he missed your

[02:04:46.290 --> 02:04:46.910]
You know

[02:04:46.910 --> 02:04:46.910]

[02:04:46.910 --> 02:04:49.050]
But because he's a big politician now

[02:04:49.050 --> 02:04:51.190]
And he like pretending that they don't know each other

[02:04:51.190 --> 02:04:52.030]
Well what's that

[02:04:52.030 --> 02:04:52.950]
Well what is that

[02:04:52.950 --> 02:04:54.250]
There were a lot of good things about the movie

[02:04:54.250 --> 02:04:55.510]
But overall it was overblown

[02:04:55.510 --> 02:04:57.670]
In addition to which when you told me that James Woods

[02:04:57.670 --> 02:04:59.730]
Was Jewish after his poor performance in her

[02:04:59.730 --> 02:05:00.910]
But that Puccino took us

[02:05:00.910 --> 02:05:03.650]
Well what kind of a Jews is Puccino took us

[02:05:03.650 --> 02:05:05.030]
I don't know maybe Jesus really

[02:05:05.030 --> 02:05:06.390]
Well I explains it

[02:05:06.390 --> 02:05:07.370]
WDQYM hello

[02:05:07.370 --> 02:05:08.710]
Hello Neil how are you

[02:05:08.710 --> 02:05:09.390]
Pretty good

[02:05:09.390 --> 02:05:11.730]
Do you have anyone tell you about saying anything yet?

[02:05:12.130 --> 02:05:12.970]
No please do

[02:05:12.970 --> 02:05:14.050]
What do you want to know

[02:05:14.050 --> 02:05:15.750]
Well how is it? You saw say nothing

[02:05:15.750 --> 02:05:17.210]
Oh yeah say anything

[02:05:17.210 --> 02:05:17.790]
That's what

[02:05:18.910 --> 02:05:20.510]
Well what do you want to know about it?

[02:05:20.650 --> 02:05:21.530]
It does have a sad ending

[02:05:21.530 --> 02:05:23.390]
No I'm not talking about that

[02:05:23.390 --> 02:05:25.350]
I just bought the movie because it looked good

[02:05:25.350 --> 02:05:27.110]
I was in the videos of the story you know

[02:05:27.110 --> 02:05:28.970]
And I bought it and then I read the reviews

[02:05:28.970 --> 02:05:30.850]
The reviews all absolutely say it sucks

[02:05:30.850 --> 02:05:32.870]
So I'm just curious is it worth watching or not

[02:05:33.290 --> 02:05:34.810]
Well that depends on you

[02:05:34.810 --> 02:05:37.570]
I mean it's about a couple

[02:05:37.570 --> 02:05:38.430]
And stuff like that

[02:05:38.430 --> 02:05:39.410]
I don't want to ruin it for you

[02:05:39.410 --> 02:05:40.590]
Well I was going to scale up 10

[02:05:40.590 --> 02:05:41.790]
How many stars would you give it?

[02:05:42.230 --> 02:05:44.850]
I would say probably a five or six at most

[02:05:44.850 --> 02:05:46.110]
I'll give it a shot

[02:05:47.150 --> 02:05:49.010]
My containing was sale give it a shot

[02:05:49.010 --> 02:05:52.730]
By the way the last American Virgin does have a very very sad ending

[02:05:52.730 --> 02:05:53.350]
Okay

[02:05:53.350 --> 02:05:56.550]
But it also has a lot of great music in the late 70s and 80s

[02:05:56.550 --> 02:05:57.610]
And George was right

[02:05:57.610 --> 02:05:59.710]
The guy did Hawk the stereo

[02:05:59.710 --> 02:06:01.230]

[02:06:01.230 --> 02:06:03.370]
Yeah I like George Borschted in Texas

[02:06:03.370 --> 02:06:04.130]
What's wrong with that?

[02:06:04.330 --> 02:06:05.230]
Okay thanks a lot Pally

[02:06:05.230 --> 02:06:06.490]

[02:06:07.030 --> 02:06:08.190]

[02:06:12.370 --> 02:06:14.970]
Maybe hucked the loose W people really cracked me up

[02:06:14.970 --> 02:06:17.430]
That goes to show you when you eat too much kosher

[02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:17.810]
You know

[02:06:17.810 --> 02:06:20.050]
Little kosher is okay a little bit of deli is good

[02:06:20.050 --> 02:06:22.750]
But too much kosher you'll be doing oil or clogs

[02:06:22.750 --> 02:06:23.490]
All over your life

[02:06:23.490 --> 02:06:26.090]
You'll be doing quintupled bypass pretty soon

[02:06:26.090 --> 02:06:27.610]
Especially on those cheese blunts

[02:06:27.610 --> 02:06:28.610]
Man I sure love those

[02:06:28.610 --> 02:06:29.490]
Oh god

[02:06:29.490 --> 02:06:30.770]
Do you ever have cheese blunts?

[02:06:31.070 --> 02:06:31.490]
Of course

[02:06:31.490 --> 02:06:32.210]

What do you mean of course

[02:06:32.950 --> 02:06:35.490]
Do you remember the villa deli used to bring out this?

[02:06:35.490 --> 02:06:36.050]
Oh boy

[02:06:36.050 --> 02:06:36.730]
That's brilliant

[02:06:36.730 --> 02:06:37.770]
Never be the same man

[02:06:37.770 --> 02:06:41.650]
It's the villa deli closed life will never ever be the same

[02:06:42.210 --> 02:06:43.250]

[02:06:47.730 --> 02:06:48.670]
The system believe it

[02:06:48.670 --> 02:06:49.730]
That German food sure is good

[02:06:50.350 --> 02:06:51.310]

[02:06:51.310 --> 02:06:52.550]

How you doing?

[02:07:07.650 --> 02:07:07.790]
Okay

[02:07:07.790 --> 02:07:10.830]
I was kind of disappointed I didn't see my favorite character yesterday

[02:07:10.830 --> 02:07:11.590]
Who's that?

[02:07:11.850 --> 02:07:12.270]
Well Hamlet

[02:07:12.270 --> 02:07:13.650]
Yeah we already had that one

[02:07:13.650 --> 02:07:14.570]
So we already tried that

[02:07:17.530 --> 02:07:17.890]
5670560

[02:07:17.890 --> 02:07:18.910]
I told you we take a lot of calls

[02:07:18.910 --> 02:07:20.630]
Maybe we'll get a good one between now and two o'clock

[02:07:20.630 --> 02:07:21.690]
You you press me on it

[02:07:21.690 --> 02:07:23.670]
You said take 50 maybe a hundred thousand

[02:07:23.670 --> 02:07:24.430]
Or maybe just

[02:07:24.430 --> 02:07:25.470]
30,000

[02:07:25.470 --> 02:07:26.190]
30,000

[02:07:26.190 --> 02:07:28.150]
I don't see a whole lot of them coming in though right now

[02:07:28.150 --> 02:07:31.170]
I know that we're trying to like extend a hand of friendship to this floor to crowd

[02:07:32.030 --> 02:07:33.730]
It's like that even on the Friday man

[02:07:33.730 --> 02:07:37.690]
Sunny shining here all that ice is melted away to now to not a flake us

[02:07:37.690 --> 02:07:40.430]
No, it looks like the middle of summertime until you walk outside of course

[02:07:40.430 --> 02:07:42.510]
Wonder what the temperature is right now. I'm sure that

[02:07:42.510 --> 02:07:44.630]
Castor Nova is taking notes on the Toronto weather

[02:07:44.630 --> 02:07:48.370]
Let me take a peek at sunny. It's beautiful. It's minus five. What is that about 26?

[02:07:48.510 --> 02:07:51.610]
I would say that would be my guess. I'm not too good at it minus stuff

[02:07:51.610 --> 02:07:52.630]
I know all the plus numbers

[02:07:52.630 --> 02:07:53.270]
Yeah

[02:07:53.270 --> 02:07:55.110]
Again to minus 20 is like 28

[02:07:55.110 --> 02:07:56.970]
That's even be like 24 or something like that

[02:07:56.970 --> 02:07:59.930]
And windy so it feels like yeah about 10 below zero

[02:07:59.930 --> 02:08:02.830]
But other than that looks really good. Nobody Q a m. Hello

[02:08:02.830 --> 02:08:04.390]
Hello. Yes sir

[02:08:05.710 --> 02:08:06.510]
Yeah, yep

[02:08:06.510 --> 02:08:08.150]
The worst ending ever

[02:08:08.730 --> 02:08:09.970]
The Truman show

[02:08:10.750 --> 02:08:11.150]
Okay

[02:08:11.970 --> 02:08:14.670]
Harris's character should have had the sap killed off

[02:08:14.670 --> 02:08:18.550]
Okay, thanks. That sounds like a Jim Kiri movie to me. It is that it works

[02:08:18.550 --> 02:08:22.390]
I know whatever I know what it is and the same thing he's happening over and over and over

[02:08:22.390 --> 02:08:25.710]
And I never saw it. You want to know why? Because just like we feel about

[02:08:27.110 --> 02:08:30.450]
Tom Hanks actually about Jim Kiri. Well, maybe not exactly the same

[02:08:30.450 --> 02:08:33.550]
No because once upon a time I actually liked Jim Kiri a little bit

[02:08:33.550 --> 02:08:38.170]
I used to like Tom Hanks. That was a long time ago. I liked him in the fish called Wanda

[02:08:38.170 --> 02:08:42.670]
That wasn't the movie. It was in the whatever it was with the the mermaid splash splash

[02:08:43.210 --> 02:08:47.970]
Well, that's pretty complicated. Splash. Who was in that who played the mermaid? Darryl Hanna. Where Darryl Hanna?

[02:08:48.050 --> 02:08:53.050]
There you go. What's he from a Hanna Barbarra? No. Anyway, she was that was pretty good. It was cute

[02:08:53.050 --> 02:08:56.210]
It wasn't a good movie but it was cute, you know, and she was in there and I'm sure you like that

[02:08:56.210 --> 02:09:00.290]
But that was it and after that he shouldn't just gone away, you know, just like Greg Reed

[02:09:00.290 --> 02:09:04.270]
Okay, you did your damage now pack up your goodies and go away clean

[02:09:04.270 --> 02:09:10.850]
As this is Neil Rogers. So out of there, this is 516-2-8-8

[02:09:19.970 --> 02:09:23.810]
They're that that they prompt him and they prompt him up against the wall and the last thing he said was

[02:09:31.750 --> 02:09:32.470]
Oh

[02:09:32.470 --> 02:09:37.370]
Here's another thing you can't refuse. It's the Neil Rogers one to two

[02:09:39.030 --> 02:09:40.710]
It seems to go

[02:09:41.550 --> 02:09:42.810]
Take the can only

[02:09:45.690 --> 02:09:51.690]
Mr. Gonzalez is the true that you as White House counsel wrote the memo which basically

[02:09:51.690 --> 02:09:57.090]
Okay is the use of non-traditional interrogation of combatants a K.A.

[02:09:57.310 --> 02:10:01.370]
Torture to gather information. Oh, that is not correct, Senator. Uh, Mr. Gonzalez

[02:10:01.370 --> 02:10:04.510]
Would you like a minute to think about that answer? No, Senator.

[02:10:06.370 --> 02:10:09.870]
Okay one more time Mr. Gonzalez. I never

[02:10:12.090 --> 02:10:18.190]
Now before I release the dog Mr. Gonzalez may I suggest if you like your family jewels in one piece

[02:10:26.170 --> 02:10:26.530]
Okay

[02:10:26.530 --> 02:10:31.770]
Okay now let's move on to your stand on Roe v. Ways. Can I have to jump a cable smooth to their lower please?

[02:10:32.070 --> 02:10:35.690]
Yeah right down to everybody is third foot two minutes after one here's the fact

[02:10:35.690 --> 02:10:39.470]
It's just how about swimming green for your movie pool what do you say I've started a long time ago

[02:10:40.310 --> 02:10:44.350]
We'll put it on there just to edify them. I mean it was just we've got the way through but whatever

[02:10:45.550 --> 02:10:46.990]

White House ordered a release five papers. Yeah, I do want to take a lot of calls

[02:10:58.570 --> 02:11:00.350]
But quite frankly they're very weak anyway

[02:11:00.350 --> 02:11:05.510]
federal judge ordered the Bush administration yesterday to release documents about its warrantless surveillance program or

[02:11:06.030 --> 02:11:11.530]
Spell out what it is withholding a setback to efforts to keep the program totally under wraps at the same time

[02:11:11.530 --> 02:11:14.930]
The Republican chairman of the Senate and Subges Committee said he had worked out in agreement with the White House

[02:11:40.550 --> 02:11:42.190]
I forgot was that just a crank?

[02:11:42.190 --> 02:11:48.090]
Was that like some serious guy? How can I try to talk about Panama city with those beautiful white beaches and all those

[02:11:48.690 --> 02:11:49.670]
busloads of glam

[02:11:50.230 --> 02:11:57.910]
A 14-year-old boy who died while being restrained at a military style boop camp suffered from sickle cell trait natural complications of which caused the teens death

Will requested the US Justice Department investigate whether Martin Lee Anderson civil rights were violated by the use of excessive force

complication of a sickle cell trait the end of it

[02:12:39.430 --> 02:12:44.350]

Unfatel one 12 angry men won red river one zero for throwing them green Friday night lights the red violin

[02:15:58.230 --> 02:16:01.930]
I thought the red violin already had one before now and I think somebody took the vote away

[02:16:01.930 --> 02:16:07.350]
Maybe it's on toy I'm a star good ship I'm a star none living down LA has gotten a thousand six votes. Okay

Don't think wow that was an interesting way to call into I think I think somebody plucked that phone line right

[02:16:44.850 --> 02:16:50.290]

[02:17:06.410 --> 02:17:12.190]
Recommending to not see broke back. I almost saw it. I don't know. Don't do it man. Don't talk about not going to

[02:17:12.190 --> 02:17:19.790]
And want to bring up I'm sure you heard the hermaphrodite polar bears that are from the pollution. Have you heard about them? No

[02:17:19.790 --> 02:17:23.370]
Okay, well up in the Arctic the polar bears have

[02:17:24.490 --> 02:17:27.870]
mutated and a lot of them become hermaphrodites because of the

[02:17:27.870 --> 02:17:28.910]
air pollution

[02:17:29.630 --> 02:17:35.050]
flying up there and then falling in rainwater into the food source and then they eat it and they become poison

[02:17:35.450 --> 02:17:37.270]
We're murdering everything up in the Arctic

[02:17:38.430 --> 02:17:40.850]
The glaciers are melting a twice the

[02:17:40.850 --> 02:17:47.090]
My pile whose matter-fac Greenland's the glaciers I got to sit right on my fist. Yeah, and

[02:17:47.910 --> 02:17:49.990]
Basically we're destroying the planet fine

[02:17:49.990 --> 02:17:54.430]
Wouldn't it be great if it would be selective in its retribution because you know

[02:17:54.430 --> 02:17:56.230]
We're getting killed by global warming and

[02:17:56.810 --> 02:17:58.870]
Cal and crazy bird and all this both

[02:17:59.470 --> 02:18:01.010]
Wouldn't be great if it just

[02:18:01.710 --> 02:18:05.770]
Unloaded on all the bastards that are actually doing the damage and the people in power

[02:18:05.770 --> 02:18:09.790]
Well, the repair is serious. Well, it's fine. Just keep that in mind. He works in mysterious ways

[02:18:09.790 --> 02:18:15.110]
Just one thing conservation dot org the conservation international you could donate to that

[02:18:15.110 --> 02:18:19.390]
I think they do good stuff for the environment. I'm pretty sure they're a solid organization

[02:18:19.390 --> 02:18:24.070]
They work with big corporations to get them to do good stuff instead of screwing everything up

[02:18:24.070 --> 02:18:26.890]
So you might want to link it on your website. I want to check it out

[02:18:26.890 --> 02:18:30.390]
But I figured I'd give you the heads up on that. Okay. Thanks. Thanks. Okay

[02:18:30.990 --> 02:18:33.750]
Hulgettry for Jesus, baby because they destroyed a planet

[02:18:34.210 --> 02:18:40.170]
Greenlands later glaciers are dumping more than twice as much ice in the land. Do you see the store in the news on this last night? No, scary

[02:18:40.170 --> 02:18:44.150]
Ah, they're dumping more than twice as much ice into the Atlantic now as 10 years ago

[02:18:44.150 --> 02:18:48.070]
Because glaciers are sliding off the land more quickly researchers said yesterday

[02:18:48.070 --> 02:18:55.110]
This could mean oceans will rise even faster than forecast and rising surface air temperatures appear to be the blame the researchers

[02:18:55.110 --> 02:18:57.570]
Reported today's issue of the journal science

[02:18:57.570 --> 02:19:03.510]
glaciers around the world are disappearing fast several researchers told a meeting of the American Association for the advancement of science

[02:19:03.510 --> 02:19:07.610]
Greenland is probably going to contribute more and faster to see level rise than predicted

[02:19:07.610 --> 02:19:12.110]
Eric Rigno of NASA's yet proportional lab at the California Institute Technology told news conference

[02:19:12.110 --> 02:19:18.810]
Between 96 and 2006 the amount of water lost from Greenlands ice sheet has more than doubled from 90 cubic kilometers

[02:19:18.810 --> 02:19:26.390]
Our kilometers to 220 cubic kilometers a year one cubic kilometers the amount of water LA uses in the year 200 cubic kilometers

[02:19:26.390 --> 02:19:34.330]
Of water is a lot of fresh water Rigno said other experts agreed this could mean that scientists have underestimated how much the sea level rise in the future is the planet warms

[02:19:34.330 --> 02:19:43.070]
At 1.7 million square kilometers at 656,000 square miles up to three kilometers nearly two miles thick and little smaller than Mexico

[02:19:43.070 --> 02:19:48.070]
The Greenland ice sheet would raise global level sea level by about 22 feet if it's not completely

[02:19:48.070 --> 02:19:49.890]
22 feet in other words

[02:19:49.890 --> 02:19:51.150]
Bye-bye Florida

[02:19:51.910 --> 02:19:54.050]
Forget about New Orleans bye-bye Florida

[02:19:54.670 --> 02:19:59.750]
And of course bye-bye Amsterdam and bye-bye a lot of places, you know, right in the York L.A.C

[02:20:00.270 --> 02:20:03.990]
There you go the state of Nantes, Florida is causing the rising air temperatures in Greenland

[02:20:03.990 --> 02:20:10.130]
But most scientists agree that human activity notably the burning of fossil fuels is playing an important role in global warming

[02:20:10.690 --> 02:20:13.210]
Is it the right doubt is if there has to be debate on this

[02:20:13.210 --> 02:20:17.950]
They've calculated that Greenland contributes about two hundreds of an inch that's half a millimeter

[02:20:17.950 --> 02:20:24.210]
A silly little millimeter to the annual one-tenth of an inch rising global sea levels since 96 southeast Greenlands

[02:20:24.210 --> 02:20:29.230]
Outlet glaciers have been flowing more quickly and since 2000 glaciers far the north have also sped up

[02:20:29.230 --> 02:20:33.010]
And then of course someday somebody will write a story about how God got angry again

[02:20:33.010 --> 02:20:38.390]
And we had the big flood everybody drown. Hey, Noah get the arc ready. Okay, maybe get a hammer and some nails

[02:20:39.050 --> 02:20:44.130]
And start grabbing you know a pair of zebras and a pair of hippopotamai and you know

[02:20:44.570 --> 02:20:48.530]
pair of this and a pair of that and don't pick Tom Cruise on there either if you want to like

[02:20:48.970 --> 02:20:53.750]
Perpetuate the human race. They sure you get a pair of keats. Yeah a pair of what? Oh keats

[02:20:53.750 --> 02:20:57.210]
I thought you said with a tea. Let's take keats with a tea pair of those a good two

[02:20:57.630 --> 02:21:01.790]
Yeah, always have one of those on there too kind of like stimulate a little bit reproduction something

[02:21:02.490 --> 02:21:04.290]
Very very sad nobody cares

[02:21:04.290 --> 02:21:09.010]
They talk about you will give ins and tree huggers and bark bark eaters and all this other crap

[02:21:09.570 --> 02:21:10.550]
I see I'm just like this

[02:21:10.550 --> 02:21:13.170]
Chaining guy there is bark is worse than is

[02:21:13.170 --> 02:21:13.750]
God

[02:21:15.570 --> 02:21:17.710]
Oh this old Harry still

Come on Harry tell us the truth

[02:21:29.570 --> 02:21:32.050]
I mean, there's about as much chance to get in the truth out of that story

[02:21:32.050 --> 02:21:38.510]
Just like a yo Kennedy came back after chape aquatic the next day and decided to show up at the police station and make up his own story

[02:21:38.510 --> 02:21:39.810]
Well, that's what's going on here

[02:21:40.470 --> 02:21:45.070]
No one will ever know the amount of carousing and boozing and smoozing and cruising and losing

[02:21:45.590 --> 02:21:48.630]

This is me a Roger

[02:22:52.450 --> 02:22:53.330]
This is

[02:22:56.770 --> 02:22:59.390]
Pericolves the watch boobs and butts and boi

[02:23:07.170 --> 02:23:12.610]
I'm driving all day long and sometimes it's all the world

[02:23:17.110 --> 02:23:18.910]
Like a

[02:23:19.650 --> 02:23:21.410]
You know

[02:23:32.390 --> 02:23:48.690]
vä

[02:23:48.690 --> 02:23:48.690]

[02:23:45.350 --> 02:23:47.390]
But

[02:23:49.310 --> 02:23:54.670]
There's a reason why chucks don't cover the dare we hear.

[02:23:55.630 --> 02:23:59.110]
I'm a home on the rain just where.

[02:24:00.710 --> 02:24:03.030]
Like a perfect house.

[02:24:03.490 --> 02:24:07.070]
Oh, speaking of that story, about that kid that died in Panama City.

[02:24:07.830 --> 02:24:11.030]
Authorities raised a videotape today showing guards restraining a boy

[02:24:11.030 --> 02:24:13.710]
to juvenile detention bootcamp just hours before he died.

[02:24:14.130 --> 02:24:17.390]
The parents of 14-year-old Martin Leanderson believed the footage

[02:24:17.390 --> 02:24:21.490]
from a bootcamp security camera will show that guards beat their son to death.

[02:24:22.310 --> 02:24:26.230]
They were viewing the one hour 20-minute tape at their lawyer's office in Tallahassee

[02:24:26.230 --> 02:24:28.030]
as the FDLE made it cubic.

[02:24:28.310 --> 02:24:29.890]
How do you like that? There's a love tape for it.

[02:24:30.150 --> 02:24:30.750]
And there's that chaining.

[02:24:30.870 --> 02:24:32.010]
There's another very prominent building.

[02:24:33.230 --> 02:24:34.970]
God. Oh, and there we go again.

[02:24:35.050 --> 02:24:36.310]
The shooting was the worst day of my life.

[02:24:36.410 --> 02:24:37.750]
I quote, I had a very long weekend.

[02:24:38.170 --> 02:24:39.610]
Thankfully, Harry's on the man.

[02:24:39.930 --> 02:24:41.490]
They didn't catch us with the brawds.

[02:24:41.710 --> 02:24:45.350]
I didn't do the breathalyzer because we made him a staldermil next day.

[02:24:45.350 --> 02:24:48.690]
Get out of here. You lion sack of garbage, you man.

[02:24:49.390 --> 02:24:51.290]
I'll never forget as long as I lived there.

[02:24:51.310 --> 02:24:53.950]
I wasted all that time before in 2000.

[02:24:54.830 --> 02:24:58.570]
I read pages and pages of that book about this guy a thousand times worse than bush.

[02:24:59.030 --> 02:25:01.210]
This is the evil doer right here.

[02:25:01.530 --> 02:25:03.170]
The other one's just a knitwit.

[02:25:03.270 --> 02:25:04.750]
He's just along for the ride on his name.

[02:25:05.750 --> 02:25:06.910]
There you go.

[02:25:07.030 --> 02:25:09.650]
And of course, you know where this is, no, it's just in Cheyenne, Wyoming.

[02:25:09.870 --> 02:25:12.250]
Right. That's in his hood where he'll feel safe.

[02:25:14.470 --> 02:25:16.010]
56670560.560 in the Verizon.

[02:25:16.190 --> 02:25:16.790]
See, look, they got it.

[02:25:16.830 --> 02:25:21.630]
So yesterday those 39% of America who just refused, don't confuse them with the truth, you know.

[02:25:22.070 --> 02:25:28.390]
Nasty, bigoted, right winged, obnoxious, Bible, Fump, and hypocritical, closet, queen, bastards.

[02:25:28.910 --> 02:25:30.770]
Whatever the hell they are. They all got their thing.

[02:25:31.730 --> 02:25:32.550]
WDQA Am hello.

[02:25:33.150 --> 02:25:35.710]
Oh, God. Yes, sir. How you doing? Great.

[02:25:36.170 --> 02:25:40.730]
I am really appreciate the Eric Altraman article that was terrific stuff.

[02:25:40.730 --> 02:25:41.430]
It was good.

[02:25:41.730 --> 02:25:46.430]
I got to tell you in the next six months with the 2006 election coming up, it's

[02:25:46.430 --> 02:25:49.450]
we're going to hear all these stories about how China is building up their military.

[02:25:50.010 --> 02:25:52.590]
And I ran, building up their new...

[02:25:52.590 --> 02:25:54.470]
I say, let's bomb everybody.

[02:25:55.130 --> 02:25:55.950]
Oh, you know.

[02:25:56.490 --> 02:25:57.790]
I got one question for you.

[02:25:58.310 --> 02:25:59.830]
And I think you mentioned the talk about it.

[02:26:00.090 --> 02:26:05.590]
Did you hear the story that he was with, that Cheyenne was with this ambassahor or something?

[02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:10.210]
Old bag, yeah. She looks like Harry Wittington. She looks just like the guy he shot.

[02:26:10.790 --> 02:26:14.830]
Yeah, well, I sent a state department an email on that so they could verify the whereabouts

[02:26:14.830 --> 02:26:16.490]
as one of their ambassahors.

[02:26:17.290 --> 02:26:18.770]
I haven't got a reply yet.

[02:26:19.070 --> 02:26:20.950]
Yeah, I guess I'm going to be registered soon.

[02:26:21.450 --> 02:26:22.650]
Yeah, I know it, bro.

[02:26:22.750 --> 02:26:24.930]
And they probably have, listen on this call right now.

[02:26:26.490 --> 02:26:27.470]
I guess we'll see.

[02:26:27.750 --> 02:26:27.990]
Thank you.

[02:26:28.110 --> 02:26:29.090]
Don't answer the door.

[02:26:30.530 --> 02:26:32.390]
In fact, if I was him, I'd be packing a piece.

[02:26:33.490 --> 02:26:34.170]
Piece of what?

[02:26:34.430 --> 02:26:35.550]
And look at that bitch, Kira Phillips.

[02:26:35.770 --> 02:26:37.130]
Seriously, her and Tina Bash.

[02:26:37.170 --> 02:26:40.390]
I don't know which one I'd like to bash their brains in if I could find them. Probably in their ass.

[02:26:41.150 --> 02:26:42.350]
Oh, I can't see it. Thank goodness.

[02:26:42.810 --> 02:26:44.390]
Why don't you check out one thing?

[02:26:44.490 --> 02:26:47.090]
I don't want to hang out there or other side and Dick Taney on the other.

[02:26:47.210 --> 02:26:48.410]
I got a baby bitch fest.

[02:26:48.610 --> 02:26:49.790]
I couldn't prove it to them on the side.

[02:26:50.770 --> 02:26:51.970]
And I mean, I did it on the other side.

[02:26:52.170 --> 02:26:56.230]
What he's doing is he comes out of a hospital, a little dog in a pony show, another photo off.

[02:26:56.430 --> 02:26:57.650]
He's showing that he's still alive.

[02:26:57.790 --> 02:26:59.390]
And there's Taney on the other side.

[02:26:59.390 --> 02:27:02.430]
And I'm going to try to do a little damage control here.

[02:27:02.650 --> 02:27:03.610]
A lot of damage control.

[02:27:04.290 --> 02:27:05.370]
And now we get rid of them off the screen.

[02:27:05.470 --> 02:27:06.350]
Now we have to look at this bitch.

[02:27:06.530 --> 02:27:10.270]
Oh, seriously, she makes Eva Brown look like a good Samirin.

[02:27:10.690 --> 02:27:11.130]
Kira Phillips.

[02:27:11.670 --> 02:27:16.190]
Oh, I bridge painted her dangles from the Jamie Bridge in St. Louis, Missouri, just in the CNN.

[02:27:16.590 --> 02:27:17.790]
And also another dog got lost.

[02:27:18.270 --> 02:27:18.510]
Really?

[02:27:22.950 --> 02:27:24.430]
Oh, my God.

[02:27:24.430 --> 02:27:29.250]
Now, here's some good news for the wife of Dolphin's lineman will not press charges in that domestic violence case.

[02:27:29.430 --> 02:27:30.490]
Gotta get the correct update.

[02:27:30.850 --> 02:27:31.030]
Okay.

[02:27:32.210 --> 02:27:33.010]
Damian McIntosh.

[02:27:33.330 --> 02:27:35.790]
I'm sure he's one of Josh's favorite football players.

[02:27:36.290 --> 02:27:36.430]
Yeah.

[02:27:36.930 --> 02:27:41.150]
The Dolphin's offensive lineman was arrested at his debut home yesterday when they charged with domestic violence.

[02:27:41.230 --> 02:27:45.530]
For literally knocking his wife to the floor was released from jail today and his own reconnaissance is there.

[02:27:45.530 --> 02:27:46.090]
That's today.

[02:27:46.590 --> 02:27:51.150]
Or I mean, yesterday, McIntosh 28 told officers he and his wife were arguing and he pushed her to the floor.

[02:27:51.150 --> 02:27:57.510]
According to a police report filed after his arrest, 1041 Wednesday morning, McIntosh told police his wife hit her head pretty hard.

[02:27:58.570 --> 02:28:04.910]
His wife, precious to Thomas McIntosh, was taken to Cleveland, clinic in Western, released the same day.

[02:28:05.250 --> 02:28:07.070]
Precious to Thomas McIntosh.

[02:28:07.310 --> 02:28:07.610]
Uh-huh.

[02:28:08.230 --> 02:28:10.030]
I wonder if she's keen to fancy on passions.

[02:28:10.370 --> 02:28:11.030]
Precious fancy.

[02:28:11.470 --> 02:28:11.850]
I'm Thursday.

[02:28:12.050 --> 02:28:14.070]
Precious McIntosh said he wouldn't press no charges.

[02:28:14.570 --> 02:28:15.670]
But I mean, put a book around itself.

[02:28:15.670 --> 02:28:24.310]
And I do like to part about how when they got there after she called from the back room, McIntosh led them to the bathroom where his wife was unre-sposited with a face down on the floor.

[02:28:24.570 --> 02:28:25.770]
No charges be a lead.

[02:28:26.250 --> 02:28:26.290]
Okay.

[02:28:27.330 --> 02:28:27.810]
WDQYM.

[02:28:27.870 --> 02:28:28.030]
Hello.

[02:28:28.750 --> 02:28:29.230]
Bill.

[02:28:29.850 --> 02:28:29.930]
Yeah.

[02:28:30.690 --> 02:28:33.690]
Hey, I just want to let you know Jimmy Hopper.

[02:28:34.090 --> 02:28:41.150]
The mock is red in Bluefield Township, Maple and Calligraph.

[02:28:41.150 --> 02:28:41.770]
Yeah.

[02:28:41.770 --> 02:28:45.010]
And then last night I made a Rio accident.

[02:28:45.790 --> 02:28:46.830]
790s of ticket.

[02:28:47.190 --> 02:28:48.790]
Yes, 790s of ticket.

[02:28:49.230 --> 02:28:57.390]
Was broadcast in Olympic hockey game, US versus Latia at 12 midnight last night.

[02:28:57.610 --> 02:28:57.870]
Wow.

[02:28:58.250 --> 02:28:59.690]
That's how you get good ratings.

[02:29:00.950 --> 02:29:02.550]
I don't do it every time.

[02:29:03.010 --> 02:29:04.910]
Man, that US live field game.

[02:29:05.730 --> 02:29:08.070]
Well, I would say if I don't know, I stayed up.

[02:29:08.690 --> 02:29:12.010]
Uh-oh, four workers run a bridge when a scaffold broke there in San Luis.

[02:29:12.210 --> 02:29:12.870]
Okay, it's big news.

[02:29:13.010 --> 02:29:13.790]
Let's hop right on it.

[02:29:13.830 --> 02:29:15.150]
Everybody start running around and circle.

[02:29:15.330 --> 02:29:15.670]
Don't forget.

[02:29:16.010 --> 02:29:18.490]
When in question or in doubt, run in circle, scream and shout.

[02:29:18.970 --> 02:29:20.270]
And should I say, don't want to get money?

[02:29:20.410 --> 02:29:22.310]
Don't, please don't go see that broadcast mountain.

[02:29:22.630 --> 02:29:23.090]
Don't rent it.

[02:29:23.330 --> 02:29:23.850]
Don't buy it.

[02:29:23.910 --> 02:29:24.430]
Don't watch it.

[02:29:24.730 --> 02:29:27.210]
And it's, and it's got, it really has nothing to do with that.

[02:29:27.330 --> 02:29:27.890]
That part of it.

[02:29:28.110 --> 02:29:29.350]
That's the least of the problems.

[02:29:29.950 --> 02:29:33.050]
The most of the problem is, ponderous and it is slow.

[02:29:33.290 --> 02:29:34.090]
And it don't go anywhere.

[02:29:34.210 --> 02:29:37.010]
The acting is as dull as a 40-year-old razor blade.

[02:29:37.010 --> 02:29:39.110]
Okay, it is just bad.

[02:29:39.330 --> 02:29:42.590]
I mean, let's, you know, we get excited about watching about the sheep running up and down the mountain.

[02:29:42.630 --> 02:29:43.690]
And the dog, the sheep dog.

[02:29:43.830 --> 02:29:45.930]
If that turns you on, man, you'll love it.

[02:29:46.030 --> 02:29:46.830]
If that's your cup of tea.

[02:29:48.010 --> 02:29:49.430]
Otherwise, forget about it.

[02:29:49.790 --> 02:29:50.730]
W.A.K.Y.M. Hello.

[02:29:51.090 --> 02:29:51.690]
Hey, Neil.

[02:29:51.890 --> 02:29:54.010]
I just got an update on Dick Cheney.

[02:29:54.870 --> 02:29:55.190]
Yeah.

[02:29:55.570 --> 02:29:57.010]
Yeah, he suffers from TCB.

[02:29:58.110 --> 02:29:58.350]
Yeah.

[02:29:58.510 --> 02:29:59.470]
Typical crack of behavior.

[02:29:59.870 --> 02:30:00.450]
Okay, excellent.

[02:30:00.930 --> 02:30:01.770]
What do we hear at that?

[02:30:02.350 --> 02:30:02.530]
Wow.

[02:30:03.330 --> 02:30:04.750]
Yeah, you're the one, man.

[02:30:05.010 --> 02:30:06.290]
I'm the one who said you're the one.

[02:30:06.290 --> 02:30:08.870]
You said, take us in and these calls are going to be fabulous.

[02:30:08.870 --> 02:30:09.630]
And you're right there.

[02:30:10.170 --> 02:30:10.450]
They are.

[02:30:10.530 --> 02:30:11.530]
I wouldn't say fabulous.

[02:30:11.530 --> 02:30:12.570]
I'd say there is special.

[02:30:13.010 --> 02:30:14.990]
Each one is special and so on right.

[02:30:15.330 --> 02:30:19.350]
You wish you could put like a little package and put like a little ribbon on it.

[02:30:19.590 --> 02:30:20.390]
Welcome back, Ray Perry.

[02:30:20.570 --> 02:30:21.670]
By the way, thanks, Ray Perry.

[02:30:21.890 --> 02:30:22.630]
Back is a good guy.

[02:30:22.810 --> 02:30:25.410]
We have no idea what he used to do, but now he's actually going to do a little bit of work.

[02:30:26.170 --> 02:30:27.850]
This is Neil Wright.

[02:30:28.490 --> 02:30:32.130]
How this is 5.60 Q.A.K.

[02:30:33.510 --> 02:30:34.230]
A consultant?

[02:30:35.570 --> 02:30:36.370]
Yeah.

[02:30:39.270 --> 02:30:40.070]
Absolutely.

[02:30:40.630 --> 02:30:45.110]
I like to go fishing inside the shower store.

[02:30:45.710 --> 02:30:47.870]
Slipside and I go fishing.

[02:30:48.470 --> 02:30:50.470]
And slapper off the wall.

[02:30:51.030 --> 02:30:55.670]
I've been going over for quite a few days at my place.

[02:30:56.570 --> 02:31:01.190]
But I must do small, tiny things all the way here.

[02:31:01.590 --> 02:31:02.950]
Boy, you're just on my list.

[02:31:02.950 --> 02:31:06.990]
Where they could shower, where it's going, far away.

[02:31:07.450 --> 02:31:08.910]
I like to go to the shower.

[02:31:09.910 --> 02:31:12.350]
And square, square, and square.

[02:31:12.790 --> 02:31:14.430]
Making a go to the shower.

[02:31:15.370 --> 02:31:17.110]
I like to go to the shower.

[02:31:23.650 --> 02:31:28.530]
I used to drink a damn beer before I start to scrub.

[02:31:29.190 --> 02:31:33.610]
I used to rub my wee wee with a pair of blue products.

[02:31:34.350 --> 02:31:38.830]
When we look at the clothes, they feel so wet and warm.

[02:31:39.490 --> 02:31:41.530]
I used to see these as a street.

[02:31:41.810 --> 02:31:46.870]
When I came myself in my own order, you can act as I just started.

[02:31:47.190 --> 02:31:50.570]
When I came to a shower, I started to play.

[02:31:50.970 --> 02:31:52.590]
I like to go to the shower.

[02:32:00.630 --> 02:32:03.950]
I don't want to say that these appearances, these speeches are contrived.

[02:32:03.970 --> 02:32:06.410]
But there was Chinese speaking in China and my woman in his own place.

[02:32:06.810 --> 02:32:08.550]
And look where your president is speaking right now.

[02:32:08.710 --> 02:32:11.050]
In Tampa, Florida, with a group of steppered wives.

[02:32:11.430 --> 02:32:13.410]
And you notice everything he says, they're all like nodding,

[02:32:13.530 --> 02:32:14.970]
just like the steppered wives and guys.

[02:32:16.050 --> 02:32:19.430]
To enable us exactly in Tampa, no less.

[02:32:19.430 --> 02:32:23.990]
And you can be sure that they were all like cherry picked and brought in by invitation only.

[02:32:24.390 --> 02:32:25.990]
And Frist and whatever else.

[02:32:26.570 --> 02:32:28.970]
Okay, moving with the worst ending, here's the top by handful.

[02:32:29.390 --> 02:32:30.150]
Do you want a small handful?

[02:32:30.550 --> 02:32:34.570]
The blabbered project 99 that was George's pick was nowhere this morning.

[02:32:34.910 --> 02:32:35.870]
And now it's on top.

[02:32:36.210 --> 02:32:38.030]
Easy writer 88, given it a little run there.

[02:32:38.370 --> 02:32:40.670]
War the world's 87, we got a good battle going on, man.

[02:32:41.150 --> 02:32:47.350]
Contact 71, AI, artificial intelligence 64, and vanilla sky rhymes with AI 57.

[02:32:47.790 --> 02:32:48.890]
Apocalypse now 43.

[02:32:49.350 --> 02:32:50.590]
I hate this pool 42.

[02:32:50.950 --> 02:32:52.250]
I know it by the way, only S31.

[02:32:52.470 --> 02:32:54.190]
Okay, so that's where we are right now.

[02:32:54.410 --> 02:32:55.390]
I think it's a good pull.

[02:32:55.490 --> 02:32:56.670]
East the J didn't fasten it.

[02:32:56.670 --> 02:32:58.990]
It is pulled really sucks today like yesterday.

[02:32:59.370 --> 02:33:01.050]
What was wrong with that cartoon pulled yesterday?

[02:33:01.490 --> 02:33:02.010]
Nothing at all.

[02:33:02.210 --> 02:33:04.930]
The only thing was wrong with it was I take full responsibility.

[02:33:04.930 --> 02:33:08.850]
We left off Andy Camp, but especially Blondie and Dagwood, my gut.

[02:33:09.490 --> 02:33:11.050]
My whole childhood.

[02:33:11.390 --> 02:33:14.930]
From the time I was like old enough to look at the funny paper like in the Godfather.

[02:33:14.930 --> 02:33:17.670]
Two about 50, you know, when I was no longer a child.

[02:33:18.050 --> 02:33:22.430]
Every time you open up with the comic section at the bottom of the front page would be Blondie.

[02:33:22.870 --> 02:33:23.790]
Right? Right?

[02:33:24.170 --> 02:33:24.690]
Wasn't it always?

[02:33:25.150 --> 02:33:25.570]
Maybe not.

[02:33:25.790 --> 02:33:30.590]
Maybe not every newspaper editor, but sure and a Rochester Democrat and Chronicle.

[02:33:30.910 --> 02:33:34.030]
Which we didn't get the Times Union because that's a bunch of Republicans, okay?

[02:33:34.710 --> 02:33:36.290]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:33:37.390 --> 02:33:38.210]
Find a wheel.

[02:33:38.570 --> 02:33:39.370]
That's what that sounds like.

[02:33:39.570 --> 02:33:39.950]
Oh, is that?

[02:33:40.030 --> 02:33:40.390]
It's not.

[02:33:40.770 --> 02:33:41.770]
It's Blondie, baby.

[02:33:42.270 --> 02:33:42.410]
Oh.

[02:33:43.610 --> 02:33:46.250]
Oh, Blondie, oh, no.

[02:33:46.630 --> 02:33:47.790]
Well, you brought it up.

[02:33:47.990 --> 02:33:49.450]
I wasn't bringing up them, okay?

[02:33:49.590 --> 02:33:51.290]
Just, okay, that's Blondie.

[02:33:51.890 --> 02:33:55.250]
Now, I guess that's where that thing came from, the Dagwood sandwich.

[02:33:56.050 --> 02:33:56.410]
Yes.

[02:33:56.890 --> 02:33:57.530]
I know that.

[02:33:57.730 --> 02:33:58.750]
I'm just saying, just don't.

[02:33:58.870 --> 02:34:00.590]
I mean, because you were eating at the sloppy sausage.

[02:34:00.950 --> 02:34:02.930]
No, I had all that good stuff from Dr. On the Baker.

[02:34:03.230 --> 02:34:05.410]
Like I said, baked ziti made it in their vest.

[02:34:06.030 --> 02:34:07.210]
And Josh was eating the same, huh?

[02:34:07.530 --> 02:34:10.310]
Yes, I don't understand why you guys don't get different stuff and like mix and match.

[02:34:10.490 --> 02:34:10.870]
You know, it's sweet.

[02:34:12.950 --> 02:34:14.210]
The flour is like mustard

[02:34:17.170 --> 02:34:17.910]
or salt.

[02:34:19.030 --> 02:34:19.430]
When it's sweet.

[02:34:19.430 --> 02:34:30.550]
I mean, it's, like, the soft industry.

[02:34:34.550 --> 02:34:39.470]
Like vaisager though, you know, rich folks like beginning to make the building safe and

[02:34:39.470 --> 02:34:39.470]

[02:34:39.470 --> 02:34:39.550]
Yeah, but, you know, I wanted to admire you guys because I could add that trainers would

[02:34:39.550 --> 02:34:39.550]

[02:34:39.550 --> 02:34:40.850]
Right I just want to have them as toothbrushes and that kind of example or like one of

[02:34:40.850 --> 02:34:46.330]
and then the other guy went in the middle he goes to the parenthouse and he can

[02:34:46.330 --> 02:34:54.090]
smell a big shirt so stupid oh my god he's definitely sure oh my god

gay bashing yeah well I see that's the interesting part of it is because

Neil yes sir somebody better be telling that Danian Mackintosh he better not

[02:37:06.890 --> 02:37:09.570]
her questions she puts the lotion in the basket

[02:37:12.410 --> 02:37:16.670]
all right see you're right to call her fabulous today what's not to like man

[02:37:17.210 --> 02:37:20.370]

[02:37:24.290 --> 02:37:27.990]
the calls today I don't you you're not very observant are you I'm actually Josh

[02:37:27.990 --> 02:37:32.370]
knows yeah I know it's already 20 till two I don't want to like you remember that show press

[02:37:32.370 --> 02:37:37.430]
your luck I don't want to do it I mean there was one little very short you know very

[02:37:37.430 --> 02:37:41.810]
brief but other than that maybe they're busy they like a pluck and chickens or something oh

[02:37:41.810 --> 02:37:47.510]
speaking of that where's that story Europe puts poultry indoors everybody listen bring your

[02:37:47.510 --> 02:37:52.910]
bird inside okay Europe puts poultry indoors is bird flu cases multiply you know this

[02:37:52.910 --> 02:37:57.030]
this really cracks me up the the way that they're getting us just everybody hysterical about this

[02:37:57.030 --> 02:38:00.970]
I guess they want to sell a lot of that time off lure or something even though it doesn't work right

[02:38:00.970 --> 02:38:04.870]
Europe threw up protective zones to keep the ever expanding bird flu from spreading the humans

[02:38:04.870 --> 02:38:09.550]
and devastating the continent's poultry industry even as researchers warned a future pandemic could

[02:38:09.550 --> 02:38:15.870]
kill a hundred and forty two million people worldwide a future pandemic could kill or not Romania

[02:38:15.870 --> 02:38:20.690]
was deemed especially at risk of human infection the WHO announced today with bird flu reported at

[02:38:20.690 --> 02:38:26.110]
thirty one separate sites Romania runs the risk of human contamination any moment a WHO expert

[02:38:26.110 --> 02:38:30.610]
Guinalr Rodier said at the end of a four day inspection tour but even though it says runs the

[02:38:30.610 --> 02:38:36.770]
risk of human contamination that still doesn't say or even imply human to human contamination follow

[02:38:36.770 --> 02:38:41.770]
that okay and I mean they're not even putting that in the stories anymore have we read about one

[02:38:41.770 --> 02:38:48.570]
person yet one who's contact contracted from another person one talk to it can talk to it can

[02:38:48.570 --> 02:38:53.070]

being I'm not a fool it is a new Roger and don't pull it this is part of 16 QA

[02:39:09.530 --> 02:39:11.290]
a heart or a liver oh

[02:39:11.290 --> 02:39:14.790]

tell me where it's fading until I spend some afternoon's recording some old foggy tunes I never

[02:39:28.550 --> 02:39:36.030]
dreamed that any of this crap would sell it all when I was done but I did view the number one

[02:39:36.030 --> 02:39:42.110]
can't keep it stocked on shelves so it's just pouring it out that damn thing is selling like

[02:39:42.110 --> 02:39:45.850]

now we got the things we first we had the beef and we had the the beef and now we got

[02:40:14.310 --> 02:40:19.290]
the wing air mongering rungsville talking about damn sure and stuff like that

[02:40:19.290 --> 02:40:23.210]
see this is the way they do it I just fill up the air waves with nothing but non-stop propaganda man

[02:40:23.210 --> 02:40:27.870]
right Hitler and Joseph Gerbels and Hermann Gehring and Rudolph Hess and it'll be proud

[02:40:27.870 --> 02:40:32.810]
a media blitz and Dr. Mengele he could have the the doctor show under he can replace Sir Jay Gupta

[02:40:57.370 --> 02:41:02.570]
the end of that today what a bahaya that you see you it must have been your psychic power because

[02:41:02.570 --> 02:41:08.250]
that's the end for the calls fact I'm shutting this baby up I just said to monitor on and that

[02:41:08.250 --> 02:41:12.650]
will you not tempted you know that's right good plan no seriously what's already 147 we got

[02:41:13.150 --> 02:41:18.010]
gildy stand and by we'll save all the good calls for gildy there you go you can call gildy and

[02:41:18.010 --> 02:41:22.350]
gargle the him all you want he'll he'll he'll be here that's it the Maryland State Board of

[02:41:22.350 --> 02:41:27.070]
elections allowed die-bowl election systems to operate its touchscreen voting machines during

[02:41:27.070 --> 02:41:32.470]
the state's 2002 gubernatorial election and the 2004 presidential primaries before the state

[02:41:32.470 --> 02:41:37.010]
agency actually certified the controversial machines according to recently disclosed documents

[02:41:37.010 --> 02:41:41.790]
and come to find out they weren't good machines mine that is a violation of state law according to

[02:41:41.790 --> 02:41:46.990]
the shady I wonder she's kind of slim shady executive director of trueboat MD dot org an election

[02:41:46.990 --> 02:41:52.190]
integrity group election integrity is not like an oxy moron what is Barbara star she's a guy to

[02:41:52.830 --> 02:41:58.730]
one quote that say so I'm saying it's a guy shade shade whatever name is discovered the

[02:41:58.730 --> 02:42:02.230]
document among thousands of others she recently acquired through a lawsuit filed against the

[02:42:02.230 --> 02:42:06.490]
Maryland state board of elections in 2004 after almost two years of public records of request

[02:42:06.490 --> 02:42:12.190]
and attorney wrangling she we see four boxes filled with email conversations faxes and contracts

[02:42:12.190 --> 02:42:18.570]
between the elections officials and die bold the anxious die bold well I got to play that so far

[02:42:18.570 --> 02:42:22.510]
we've only gone through one box and have just started the second box she said Wednesday we've

[02:42:22.510 --> 02:42:27.610]
specifized much more meanwhile republican uh governor Maryland Robert early junior delivered a

[02:42:27.610 --> 02:42:32.010]
scathing letter to the state board of elections Wednesday lashing out of the agency for

[02:42:32.010 --> 02:42:36.390]
intended to use die bold systems for the upcoming 2006 election while Californian Pennsylvania

[02:42:36.390 --> 02:42:41.250]
either desertified or refused to certify the voting systems which recent studies show can

[02:42:41.250 --> 02:42:47.070]
easily be hacked to manipulate votes that that that I no longer have confidence in the state

[02:42:47.070 --> 02:42:51.810]
board election they conduct fair and accurate elections in 2006 the republican governor stated in

[02:42:51.810 --> 02:42:57.110]
a four page letter how do you like that the republican governor of Maryland no longer has confidence

[02:43:20.170 --> 02:43:23.610]
in die bold because the fix is in

[02:43:58.070 --> 02:44:07.990]
just

[02:44:24.390 --> 02:44:29.410]
I'm thinking of Captain Harris. What was the vision Tommy's planning of her, uh, Theresa

[02:44:29.410 --> 02:44:36.050]
Newer? Theresa Lapur would those, uh, butterfly ballots, although butterflies are free. I think

[02:44:36.050 --> 02:44:40.990]
people ought to give a Theresa maybe a butterfly kiss right on the, uh, on the ass. You stop and

[02:44:40.990 --> 02:44:43.650]
you think back to all that and then of course those maniacs from out of state who got

[02:44:43.650 --> 02:44:47.470]
sent in. What else then? What else in? Dave County pounding the doors down because they wanted

[02:44:47.470 --> 02:44:51.670]
to make sure the fix was in and it was two fixed presidential elections in the world. Confidence

[02:44:51.670 --> 02:44:57.030]
is low for the outcome of the, uh, midterm elections this fall. In fact, I got news for it because

[02:44:57.030 --> 02:45:01.350]
of these special powers that, uh, your president and vice president keep, uh, asserting that they've got.

[02:45:01.490 --> 02:45:05.110]
I think they might just decide to call them off altogether. Wouldn't surprise them. We've got

[02:45:05.110 --> 02:45:11.590]
an important fish to fry. We got to attack Iran and China and Syria, Canada. Jesse Jashin and

[02:45:11.590 --> 02:45:16.730]
Condo Leisure Rice get the top support among Blacksassed and Indonesians. Most important Black leader,

[02:45:17.010 --> 02:45:22.690]
according to an AP AOL Black voices pool next come Roland Cole and sell out Powell and Barack Obama.

[02:45:23.270 --> 02:45:27.250]
Many Blacks question whether any one person can wear leadership mantle for such a large and diverse

[02:45:27.250 --> 02:45:30.510]
group of people. Even Mickey Mantle couldn't wear it. That's why Willie Mays had to come along.

[02:45:31.010 --> 02:45:33.850]
At the same time, two thirds of the polls that leaders in their communities were effective

[02:45:33.850 --> 02:45:38.150]
representatives of their interests. When Blacks were asked to come up with the one person they

[02:45:38.150 --> 02:45:44.630]
considered the most important Black leader, 15% chose Jesse Jashin. Nobody picked Reggie Jashin or Michael

[02:45:44.630 --> 02:45:49.630]
Jashin. Who did mold a civil rights activist who ran from president in the 80s, uh, Jackson? Well,

[02:45:49.730 --> 02:45:54.830]
like we need to find out who wrote this APU idiot. While 11% picked Condo Leisure,

[02:45:55.210 --> 02:46:00.570]
8% Colin Roland sell out Powell with his vile comments and 6% named Barack Obama Freshman

[02:46:00.570 --> 02:46:04.130]
Democratic Center for Illinois. About a third decline of all interior name like we don't know.

[02:46:04.650 --> 02:46:08.730]
Less than one in five of those pulled only 18% said the current Black leadership's doing a very

[02:46:08.730 --> 02:46:13.170]
effective job. A representative Black community. They are absolutely correct. I'm kind of dissolution

[02:46:13.170 --> 02:46:17.730]
said, retiree John Manning who says the leadership is somewhat effective somewhat. The

[02:46:17.730 --> 02:46:21.090]
Democrat from Port Charlotte Florida added they seem to be going in different directions.

[02:46:21.450 --> 02:46:25.390]
There doesn't seem to be a cohesiveness and that's because they're all busy grand standing. Wait

[02:46:25.390 --> 02:46:29.050]
to hear your well-scottes and votes. You're going to pee in your pants. You're going to have a

[02:46:29.050 --> 02:46:34.610]
wet spot on it's here where Randy left that stain. Nation of Islam Minister Louis Farrakhan got

[02:46:34.610 --> 02:46:42.170]
4% talk to Oprah Winfrey got 3% King who was killed Martin Luther King's union 68% got 3%

[02:46:42.170 --> 02:46:47.070]
I don't understand. He's dead. Still dead. And former Democratic presidential candidate L Sharpton got

[02:46:47.070 --> 02:46:54.710]
2% 14% picked somebody else. 3% said Oprah Winfrey is the most important Black leader in America

[02:46:54.710 --> 02:47:03.550]
today. I can't even what they probably already read that book. This is Neil Rogers. This is 5.62.8.

[02:47:04.810 --> 02:47:06.410]
Neil God.

[02:47:13.010 --> 02:47:18.590]
All right. Don't lie. All the Harper.

[02:47:22.570 --> 02:47:24.610]
Oh

[02:47:24.610 --> 02:47:25.450]
Red.

[02:47:25.450 --> 02:47:27.510]
I don't know how to talk about that.

[02:47:28.370 --> 02:47:30.010]
That pre-tarded damn witch.

[02:47:30.350 --> 02:47:30.790]
Absolutely.

[02:47:31.510 --> 02:47:32.950]
You don't have a talk about that.

[02:47:33.250 --> 02:47:34.990]
Oh, you're not TV.

[02:47:36.210 --> 02:47:38.690]
He's President of the fucker.

[02:47:39.190 --> 02:47:42.930]
Republican muscle is in our table.

[02:47:43.290 --> 02:47:43.950]
It is.

[02:47:44.290 --> 02:47:48.630]
I don't know why they want this young,

[02:47:48.930 --> 02:47:52.930]
but no, he's the only person who's left for you.

[02:47:52.930 --> 02:47:53.610]
Rectum.

[02:47:53.790 --> 02:47:55.650]
President of the fucker.

[02:47:56.390 --> 02:47:57.190]
Republican.

[02:47:58.390 --> 02:47:59.190]
Republican.

[02:47:59.910 --> 02:48:02.530]
Oh, what I get to,

[02:48:03.310 --> 02:48:04.950]
the vote goes wrong.

[02:48:05.930 --> 02:48:09.810]
And get to we go vote it wrong.

[02:48:12.950 --> 02:48:14.790]
Did you want this?

[02:48:16.310 --> 02:48:17.250]
Don't know, no.

[02:48:17.750 --> 02:48:20.490]
It's rummaging stupidity.

[02:48:21.530 --> 02:48:22.910]
Don't know, no.

[02:48:23.230 --> 02:48:26.170]
Oh man, this drunk in rich kid.

[02:48:27.190 --> 02:48:28.450]
Don't know, no.

[02:48:28.650 --> 02:48:29.450]
He's even.

[02:48:30.230 --> 02:48:31.370]
