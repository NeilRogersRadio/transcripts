[00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.440]
The music expressed on the previous program is by the way did the cast of the Incadensis for you, but in it you jacked it.

[00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.420]
It's the best of a thorough state in this.

[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.420]
It's for the radio, but it's for the radio.

[00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.480]
Kenny and Fort Lauderdale might have, and take a fast, by the way, if people are starting to rock.

[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.940]
It's Friday, you play a series.

[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:56.620]
In Miami, Florida, here's what's happening today, just for you.

[00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:05.940]
As your community-minded station, 560 WQA up, want you to know what's happening all week long, right here in Miami.

[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:17.420]
Starting this Saturday, the retard parade sponsored and led by the Miami City Commissioners, then become a sacrifice at Kayaocho, as angry Cubans offer you what the Tupa Hobra.

[00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:27.480]
The Lapitha homeless tour featuring misery, starvation and other maladies under the 395 overpass, plus it's leave at 9 a.m. from the Burdad section of Liberty City.

[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:37.200]
Don't miss the Miami-Date Police Bravo Festival and the grand opening of the new smash-addict methadone centers, all this and more in the bedroom countable world.

[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.980]
It's great to be in Miami.

[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.880]
Better for you than me. It's a 10-1-560 WQA. They're at the end of the big O for the Humper Show.

[00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.940]
We had one of the great misfits of all time. The guy with the eyes, your body and your appearances.

[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.340]
I sent Josh in there to tell them it was too late.

[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.240]
Gournish Telfan.

[00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.020]
See, that's one thing about the board ops like Gryper, you know. They just, they don't know anybody. And that's, of course, they're all sports and nerds.

[00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.840]
Here's a rule of thumb to tell if it's one of our retard chronics. If they mention your name.

[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.980]
Right. That's generally a pretty good hint.

[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.100]
Yeah. Cause like regular ordinary normal people aren't going to be calling.

[00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.960]
Or you're going to be doing a crossover with a nailer like, hey, yeah, that's a...

[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.660]
But obsessed, you know, obsessed because...

[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.120]
I have no idea.

[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.560]
...and they could cast it, he turned them down, I guess.

[00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.680]
Keep listening, Parkford Redgar family records, Kenny.

[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.520]
See, and you know what I was just thinking about? Because I don't think about those people often, thank goodness.

[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.480]
But how old are some of these people got a V-Buy?

[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.740]
And are like in their 40s maybe pushing 50s some of them, you know. Some of the people with the LLT and the Red Breath.

[00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.660]
And...

[00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.680]
It's still the same. Nothing has changed.

[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.420]
Ah, lots of the time.

[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.640]
The little fraternity, they still have the regular meetings, you know. They sit around the smoking...

[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.060]
...camel.

[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:48.260]
Camel.

[00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.140]
Oh, not what you're thinking.

[00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.880]
They're not a peal.

[00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.140]
No.

[00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.400]
They kind of poured the good stuff.

[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.640]
Oh, yeah. Even Sigourney Weaver's got better stuff than they got.

[00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.240]
Oh, you better not play that, you might get somebody aroused out there. Hey Kenny.

[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.560]
OK, that's not...

[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.780]
Don't play David Cassie underneath the bad music from the bad news.

[00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.700]
An explosion rocked a Shiite mosque in Northern Baghdad after religious services today.

[00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.640]
Kill your lease 43, wounding another 138.

[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.700]
Oh, brother, it sounds pretty bad.

[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.680]
Oh my God.

[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.100]
Major Fala Al-Mohamadawi. That's his name.

[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.480]
So dozens were wounded and the blasts, he said the occasionally toll was based on reports from three hospitals.

[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.600]
43 day and 138 at least wounded. They're still counting bodies and body parts.

[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.160]
Everything is just fine over there.

[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.900]
Really well, it's really going swimmingly well.

[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.420]
Anyway, we're not going to get too newsy anymore after yesterday.

[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.540]
We had so many great calls including that lady that called 400 times.

[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.040]
Then I find out from Josh that she called her front or office. She called the front desk.

[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.420]
And what did she want? She wanted the email.

[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.140]
Even though George already got one from her.

[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.400]
Right. She already had email, George, but she called out there to bug them too.

[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.680]
So like I said, most women are curfews and just annoying.

[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.080]
Well, she was bugging, you know, K-carlo.

[00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.340]
So, hey, you know, like I said, good job.

[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.400]
He deserves to be bugged.

[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.000]
Oh, I got a one for that.

[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.040]
I know, you know what time you got food there already?

[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.860]
I was just on the bagel showed up magically.

[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.000]
Oh no, that's bad stuff for you.

[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.560]
The east in there you're going to have a headache.

[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.840]
Your head's going to be throbbing.

[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.720]
You're going to have a Houston texture.

[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.020]
You're going to feel like the quarterback of Notre Dame.

[00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.780]
There's just a Todd Mabertill that chile from Howie's got to meet the quarterback in Notre Dame myself.

[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.620]
But anyway, of all the things that he'll talk about, which is the most interesting to you.

[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.560]
That was our poll yesterday.

[00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.020]
Our interesting poll.

[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.240]
I'll not as interesting as any Sochin and those shows on Socks.

[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.380]
I remember he used to say I'm a very interesting guy.

[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.760]
1235 votes.

[00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:40.740]
Politics 572.

[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.160]
Bush bashing like that guy tried to do yesterday at that Trumped up appearance.

[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.560]
The guy, but it would have opened a crowd as booing.

[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.660]
Oh, Bush is pretending to be Oh no.

[00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:50.400]
Let him speak.

[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.920]
Let him speak.

[00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.240]
And then of course he only responded to one thing and gave exactly the answer you'd expect.

[00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.020]
Everything is for our safety, you know, safety of the American people.

[00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.900]
And they're all cheering.

[00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.740]
Hey, don't slam it over on us and I was the end of that.

[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.240]
And then you failed to point out that he didn't respond to any of the other things that the guy brought up.

[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.040]
But that's okay.

[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.480]
Just like Scott Mausel-Brien this morning trying to cover up after Bill Schneider.

[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.880]
Talk about the leaker and chief and all this other stuff.

[00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.660]
It's just a garnish dolphin, man.

[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.580]
They're all there.

[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.420]
They're all on the take.

[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.280]
They're all on the payroll.

[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.120]
Anyway, all the things I talk about which is the most interesting.

[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.720]
You politics 572.

[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.880]
Inside radio stuff 163.

[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:23.500]
Religion 131.

[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:24.900]
How about that Judas, huh?

[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.600]
Good guy.

[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:26.740]
Thought he was a bad guy.

[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.600]
Now he's a good guy.

[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.500]
It's the home of the good guys W ABC.

[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.120]
Or was that WMCA, I think?

[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:32.140]
I don't know.

[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.300]
I hate this poll.

[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.980]
I didn't know it was WMCA with Joe.

[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.700]
What was the name?

[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:37.500]
Not Joe, Brian.

[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.540]
Whatever his name was.

[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:39.660]
Jewish stuff 56 like.

[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.400]
Oh!

[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.680]
Paisach coming up.

[00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.660]
And by the way, you'll be interested in know that in Chinese, the opposite of delicious

[00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:45.980]
is halosius.

[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.880]
Add that to your vocabulary.

[00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.000]
You've already got it there.

[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.040]
Halosius.

[00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.220]
Food slash restaurants 49.

[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.600]
Probably like those bagels are reading.

[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.120]
Gay stuff 45.

[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.000]
Oh, this audience just thrives on.

[00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.920]
Especially the guy with the eyes.

[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.140]
Taki 41.

[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.400]
Slots and gambling 25.

[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.820]
Get a good machine.

[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.760]
That's my best advice.

[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.780]
Find a good machine.

[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.240]
And if somebody else is playing it, just knock their ass off it on the floor.

[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.080]
So excuse me.

[00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.320]
And then just sit right down.

[00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.240]
Amsterdam 21.

[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:12.980]
Used to be a very exciting place.

[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.500]
Now there's too many Dutch people there.

[00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:15.500]
The track 12.

[00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.200]
Now forget that.

[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.020]
That guy that called about Geltstein yesterday, he had to be from across the street.

[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:19.700]
Had to be.

[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.500]
Nobody wants to hear about the race track.

[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.180]
Tell Hank that when he comes back from the Woodman World on Monday.

[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.940]
Nobody wants to hear about horse racing.

[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.100]
Immigration 11.

[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.540]
Except a bunch of old guys that stand out near the track kicking the tickets around.

[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.880]
Health problems 8.

[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.140]
The stock market 7 and diet talk is deadliest 5.

[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.560]
They don't want to hear no diet talk.

[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.960]
They want to mind your mind, man.

[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.040]
Maybe that's why they didn't that toss the thing.

[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:40.880]
They didn't go over so big.

[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:41.140]
Yeah.

[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.380]
That I thought was a great discovery.

[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.680]
And that you're reading and I'm eating and beef is eating.

[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.620]
And a couple of others.

[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.040]
But they go over because they don't want to stay alive.

[00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.500]
They'd rather just pick out and croak.

[00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.840]
And in a lot of cases, that's not such a bad idea.

[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.320]
Here's today's poll question.

[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:58.180]
Of course, this is what everybody, isn't this what you're thinking about 24-7 now?

[00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.080]
What Judas?

[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.240]
No, Katie Kirk.

[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:00.780]
Forget about Judas.

[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.640]
He was small.

[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.060]
He ain't going to be doing the CBS even he knew.

[00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.180]
Now I will say this.

[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.200]
If they could bring Judas back to do the CBS even he'd beat the pants off of Katie Kirk.

[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.320]
Look, and maybe this will be the show for Judas.

[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.460]
Have all the things that they're throwing at us on the news.

[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.100]
Well, CBS even he knows with Judas is scary.

[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.180]
Or why can't you see it now?

[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.860]
Look at all the swirled their fitness.

[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.360]
Katie Kirk, this this Faggot prostitute Judas.

[00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.720]
This is CBS.

[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:27.520]
Yeah.

[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.540]
Is there any real good about what's her name is making a comeback now over there in Aruba?

[00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:32.860]
Oh, what they found her?

[00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:33.980]
I don't know.

[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:34.960]
That chickener-looking body.

[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:35.520]
That chickener-rooba?

[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.140]
It's tasty.

[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.000]
Chicken and aruba.

[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:38.860]
894 votes.

[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.860]
Yeah, maybe that's where Hannibal Lecter was calling from.

[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.040]

[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.780]
Look, it looked like it could have been aruba, didn't it?

[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.220]
It's a dish you make with yellow rice.

[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:44.500]
I know.

[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.540]
No, but seriously, listen, remember when he made that last call?

[00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:46.980]
That's right.

[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.180]
I could have been there.

[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.420]
We saw the other one.

[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.280]
Maybe that's the friend who was having the other one in it because it was so bad.

[00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.240]
I remember there were the airplane the way he was feeding the little kid brains.

[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:56.260]
No, seriously.

[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:57.400]
The sequel.

[00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:58.360]
How did he end?

[00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.660]
He was on an airplane and a little kid?

[00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:01.280]
Hannibal.

[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.520]
He was feeding him brains?

[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.160]
Little kid.

[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.920]
It didn't like the airplane food.

[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.960]
Hannibal said, you have very good taste here, have some of this, and opened up a little

[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.980]
Tupperware bowl where he had some brains in there.

[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:11.740]
Ooh, nice.

[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.680]
He didn't eat it to this little kid.

[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.420]
Should have fed that to the president.

[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.540]
Well, you watch Katie Curric on a CBS evening news.

[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.620]
That's the leaker-in-chief by the way, the president.

[00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.140]
894 votes already.

[00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:23.060]
Our goal is a thousand.

[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.520]
Once we get that, we're going home.

[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.180]
Don't watch Network News 286.

[00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:27.900]
286.

[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.760]
32% of this audience don't watch Network News.

[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.380]
How dare you, now!

[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:34.500]
I don't blame you.

[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:35.440]
Waste of time.

[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:36.160]
Oh, look at that.

[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:36.980]
There's Mrs. Limbaugh.

[00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:37.560]
Give me some coke.

[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:38.820]
Give me some coke.

[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.460]
She pushes her hair back and, oh, come on.

[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.520]
Stop already.

[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:42.900]
Will you?

[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.300]
Stop with a crap.

[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.660]
Katie Curric blows 225.

[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.200]
You said that.

[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:47.860]
That was my vote.

[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.900]
I wouldn't watch her if you paid me by the millisecond if there was like a meter running

[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.000]
with like dollar signs.

[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:53.860]
I wouldn't watch it.

[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.200]
Don't watch CBS now.

[00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.000]
I won't watch her either.

[00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:56.740]
207.

[00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.060]
I used to before, a funny, dah-di-oki doki.

[00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.580]
Oh, there's your buddy, Ludab.

[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.020]
He's broken.

[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:01.600]
Borders.

[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.600]
Send a show down the end of Steve-o.

[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.520]
Talk about a one-note Charlie, man.

[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.680]
Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap.

[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:07.180]
God.

[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.700]
I think they adrained some of the air out of his cheeks.

[00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:11.260]
Watch others now.

[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.540]
But we'll watch her 60.

[00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:13.240]
Do you believe that?

[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.240]
60 people say they watch other newscasts now, but they'll watch Katie.

[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:16.800]
60.

[00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:17.300]
Okay.

[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.680]
I hate this full of 57.

[00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.700]
Watch CBS now, and we'll watch her.

[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:21.720]
I'll continue 55.

[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.600]
She looks a little bit like Bob Sheeper.

[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.020]
And watch CBS now, but won't watch her only 7.

[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:27.500]
We put that on late, but still only.

[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.500]
Solemnites yet, they're not too good out of 902.

[00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:30.920]
Not too great.

[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.080]
The guy with the eyes.

[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.020]
Well, that just didn't great to see where they-

[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.000]
Where do you think they want to be?

[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:36.880]
Listen to me.

[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.600]
Where are the only ones that know anything about talk radio?

[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:40.940]
See, that's the problem.

[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.380]
Sports talk is not talk radio.

[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:42.860]
Right.

[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.560]
That's why the boardoffs during those sports shows never seem to know the voices.

[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.880]
That's why the same people are on over.

[00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:50.760]
I mean, our show, of course, we let-

[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.360]
You can't come more than 30 times a day.

[00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:53.360]
Well, it's a good thing that the whole-

[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.640]
Like that woman yesterday.

[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:55.920]
Yeah, it's a good thing the whole-

[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:56.280]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.080]
Well, you expect-

[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:57.080]

[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:57.980]
That way to be an all fairness.

[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.620]
You expect the big ol' who's on from 5 to 7 in the morning.

[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.400]
Even the guy with the eyes is not trawling at that hour.

[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.860]
The big ol' who claims to be-

[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:05.940]
He listened to you since high school.

[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.140]
I should know who the chronics are.

[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:07.940]
No, he-

[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:08.460]
Come on.

[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.240]
That's-

[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.280]
That's ridiculous.

[00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.100]
That's way above and beyond.

[00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.680]
When you're as chronic as I am.

[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.120]
These-

[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.060]
No, these people haven't been traumatized by the-

[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.780]
This group of misfits like we have.

[00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:20.100]
Yeah, they have.

[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:20.780]
They just never noticed.

[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:21.400]
Oh.

[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:25.420]
I was gonna say-

[00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:48.540]
Yeah.

[00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.860]
I bet you that Kenny would like somebody to throw him a banana.

[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:53.020]
Wouldn't surprise me.

[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.700]
I know somebody who might-

[00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:04.480]
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-

[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.700]
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-

[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:06.760]
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-

[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:06.760]

[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:06.760]

[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:06.860]
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-

[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:07.600]
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-

[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:07.640]
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-

[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:07.780]
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-

[00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:07.780]

[00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:07.800]
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-

[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.260]
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-

[00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.080]
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-

[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:10.820]
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-

[00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:11.560]
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-

[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.300]
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-

[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.240]
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-

[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.480]
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-

[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:19.700]
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-

[00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:24.680]
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-

[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.040]
Conflicting Panther playoff games against the Marlins?

[00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.060]
No, we won't.

[00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:28.880]
Because it won't be any.

[00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.560]
Yeah, the Tampa Bay Lightweight stay one last night in the shootout.

[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:33.800]
Was the shootout over time.

[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.020]
It was the shootout against Atlanta.

[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.100]
So Atlanta got another point, but Tampa got two more.

[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.480]
So the Panthers are now-

[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.400]
It's not official, but it's as close to official.

[00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.520]
I mean, they're behind everybody now, even behind the Leafs.

[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.280]
The Make Believes got like 80, and Atlanta 81,

[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.580]
and the Panthers with 77.

[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:47.720]
It's not going to-

[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.400]
Not going to cut it.

[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.000]
No chance.

[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.020]
So when you hear those promos and those rejoins

[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.620]
that they're about, hey, the final four games, they're out for good of them.

[00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.500]
I mean, go and see them if you want, but tell me what you want to get in for free.

[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.220]
They'll let you in.

[00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:00.300]
Because if they can count you for the attendance, they'll even let you in for free, I think.

[00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:02.220]
Oh, yeah, bring a whole bunch of your friends too.

[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:03.680]
We'll put that in the attendance numbers.

[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.480]
Makes Alan Cohen feel like a real success.

[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.720]
Gjaldi is the center two to four.

[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.160]
He'll be us back in it.

[00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.680]
Mad Dog get Augusta at the Masters with Curtis.

[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.420]
I don't understand that.

[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:14.820]
In other words, he's going to be doing the-

[00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:18.580]
From four to six for a 40, and Curtis will be also with the Bank and the Center.

[00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:19.620]
Is that what that is?

[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.080]
You're asking someone?

[00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:22.120]
I'm asking Josh.

[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:22.680]
I'm asking Josh.

[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:23.500]
Yeah, that's what that is.

[00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:24.420]
You're asking me.

[00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:25.380]
God, I'm asking you.

[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:26.280]
Excuse me.

[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.060]
Don't get all testing.

[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:27.620]
I just-

[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:32.040]
I just want to go to our hernia now with Norma Kent to work on your new deal now to get a little security.

[00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:34.140]
You know, so you're going to have to have quite some hours.

[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:34.600]
I don't know.

[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.540]
That was a hit for Josh to answer, because I knew you were talking to me.

[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.780]
Oh, well, yeah, that's the-

[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:38.900]
Right.

[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:39.620]
Well, he's-

[00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:41.420]
He wants to get paid by the word now.

[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.720]
He's playing hardball.

[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:43.480]
Keep it tallie.

[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:44.480]
He's playing hard to get.

[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:45.200]
That's what I said.

[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:46.020]
That's what Dustin.

[00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:47.000]
Playing hard to get.

[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.180]
Then we got Marlon's on decades, X-40 on Q-I-M, and then Marlon's at the Mets at 710.

[00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.100]
What a strange time to start a game at 710.

[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.580]
Leave it to the Mets, Mets suck.

[00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:01.000]
And then the Panther preview was over on 1360 at 7 and Panther is in Penguins at, uh, uh, whatever.

[00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.020]
I'm- I'm K-E-T at 730.

[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.600]
And any K from Vegas follows all of these things.

[00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:06.320]
All of these things.

[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:07.960]
Any K plunge in his guts out in Vegas.

[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.920]
Well, if there's one thing I can't stand, this guy's who games-

[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.020]
This is Neil Rogers.

[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.500]
This is 516 Q-A-M.

[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.680]
And then Mike Blow.

[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.760]
Chris is dead?

[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.640]
He's a J-J-J.

[00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:26.680]
No, Charlie.

[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:27.860]
Did he relate it?

[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:28.600]
That's his brother.

[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:29.380]
Good brother.

[00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:33.340]
I know, Todd Steg is a J-Republican.

[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.580]
No such thing as a J-R-E-T.

[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.640]
That Charlie Chris is not gay?

[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.080]
That's Finisher Cooling.

[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.820]
He's running for governor.

[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.100]
Governor of law.

[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.040]
The lever chaps clothes.

[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.000]
No, no. He lasts for a while.

[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.560]
Jesus Christ, we're jobless.

[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.860]
This message paid for by Chris James with D-Grip Public and Todd's office.

[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.020]
And maybe Mark Follick can sit right up there in the throw next to it, Charlie.

[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.520]
He wins the election, but I doubt it.

[00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.580]
Uh, 1016 at 560 W.Q.

[00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:00.720]
I'm happy Friday to you.

[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.280]
And just a couple of things before we dive into a bunch of call.

[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.720]
Well, wait a minute. Maybe we'll take one.

[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:06.700]
Maybe it's the comedy eyes.

[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.420]
What do you think? Oh, if we're lucky.

[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:09.880]
W.Q.A.M. Hello.

[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.120]
Governor of law.

[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:12.660]
The lever chaps.

[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:13.760]
Q.I.M.

[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.540]
Yes, good morning.

[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:16.380]
Yes, sir.

[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.080]
Can you do something on Chronic Friday?

[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.220]
Oh, no. Not for not with you.

[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.440]
It can be all Chronic. That's Friday. How's that?

[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:23.940]
Was that good or what?

[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:25.580]
And you notice how he like-

[00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:27.220]
He was cupping me from-

[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:27.320]
Yeah.

[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.060]
With a noise-woody. He was like this.

[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:31.860]
Right. Cup this. I hear his cup run up over.

[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.060]
567. Let's have-

[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:34.440]
I like that. All Chronic Friday.

[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.760]
In fact, we're going to kill him all today right here on the year.

[00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:38.360]
Oh, God. I'd pay money for that.

[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.020]
Hmm. Take- take up a collection for that.

[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.020]
567-0560.

[00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:46.460]
Pound 560 in the Verizon singular wireless lines.

[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.320]
Your choice for two to four now.

[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.140]
We've had this embarrassment going on for months.

[00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:51.760]
When did most finally get-

[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.420]
Uh, asked to say goodbye.

[00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:54.920]
Was it like in March?

[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.020]
Get out of here.

[00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:57.460]
March is contracted in March.

[00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:00.020]
That's crazy. Back in the end of January, I believe.

[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:01.800]
Okay. And here it's the-

[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.680]
Today's the 6th-7th of April.

[00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:05.500]
Ciette. They are real.

[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.680]
And we're still a pochkin around.

[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:09.600]
It's gildy. It's Curtis. It's this one.

[00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:10.280]
It's that one. Come on.

[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.740]
Let's find out who the audience would like to have in there from two to four.

[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.800]
Maybe we'll stick George in there from two to four.

[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:15.700]
George and-

[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:16.440]
George.

[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:17.440]
One.

[00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.280]
For next to 15 bucks a week.

[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:20.260]
Yeah, a bargain.

[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.460]
And I might even pay on time, but I doubt it.

[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:23.460]
WQAM. Hello.

[00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.060]
Hi, Neil. How's your knee doing there, buddy?

[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:27.660]
It's beautiful. It's-

[00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.180]
I look it.

[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.400]
Hey, you know, yeah, think about it. WQAM. Hello.

[00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:34.760]
The priest said get on your knees and play.

[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.360]
Yeah, I've just got through it. It's in-

[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.360]
It's Friday's knee show.

[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:39.960]
I don't know how is my knee doing.

[00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:40.760]
It's scabby.

[00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:41.060]

[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.620]
Sorry, I have the bandage off there. Healed up real good.

[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:44.660]
Got any pus to squeeze?

[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.120]
No, I don't have no pus.

[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.640]
No, that's on the phone. Just squeeze the pus out of the door.

[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:50.840]
See? WQAM. Hello.

[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:52.260]
I want scum for help.

[00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:54.740]
And the little little little little little little.

[00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.800]
Oh, that's over there.

[00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:58.040]
Sure some-

[00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.660]
Sure some of those brains to that guy sounds like he can use it.

[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:02.380]
For a little knee, zerid.

[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:03.620]
Man, that was good.

[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.160]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.

[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.360]
Let me take a look at my knee.

[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.000]
Oh, it's just like a little red mark there.

[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.080]
It looks like nothing ever happened.

[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:10.760]
I think-

[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:11.780]
Oh, I think it's bleeding again.

[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.180]
Dominic QAM. Hello.

[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.380]
Hi, Neil. How are you?

[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:16.000]
Great.

[00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:19.280]
First of all, let me tell you, 80 curd makes me nauseous.

[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:19.600]
Yeah.

[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:24.460]
Second of all, I'm the guy who called with Van is almost correct.

[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.700]
He's unfortunately she had a birthday since I first heard of him.

[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.120]
Yeah, don't give me this 48 crap.

[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.100]
She's 40, and it looks a day over 70.

[00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:35.160]
Well, anyway, I just called to re-interrate that.

[00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:36.880]
No, we already got it.

[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.520]
Okay, thanks very much for pointing out that I made a bad mistake.

[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.580]
And we appreciate that, but don't paint yourself in the back too hard, okay?

[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:43.860]
Great. I wouldn't say it was a bad mistake.

[00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:46.000]
I don't think if you want that on your tombstone,

[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.600]
that this is what you're known for in your lifetime,

[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.020]
the fact that you got Van is age almost right, you know?

[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.200]
That's true. However, Jonathan is that she's Miami.

[00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:54.300]
What is it?

[00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:55.620]
She's from Miami.

[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.520]
Yeah. Well, I told you there's a reason we can't stand her.

[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.220]
Now, she's just there, you know.

[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.540]
She could be there or not.

[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:04.060]
They could just automatically do the letters which they do anyway.

[00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:04.860]
Just press a button.

[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:06.780]
So it really isn't relevant to anything.

[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:09.260]
She's just there except for the guys who think,

[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:11.780]
she's hot, just like Jackie Johnson.

[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:13.800]
There's a female. She's on TV.

[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.640]
It's just like you're always saying about, you know,

[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:16.540]
because they're on television.

[00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:18.100]
Right. That's it. It's all it takes.

[00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:20.680]
It's like Howard Ville. Cause you're on television, dummy.

[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.700]
So therefore if she's on TV or in the movies, she's hot.

[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:27.300]
And I'm gagging on. See, that is punishing me.

[00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:28.580]
I think it's due to this is scary.

[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:29.820]
It's going to get me for that.

[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:30.940]
Due to this is carrot.

[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.300]
Due to this is carrot.

[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.360]
And not the course Kenny's banana.

[00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:36.120]
WDQAM. Hello.

[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:37.340]
QAM.

[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:38.580]
Hey, Neil. How you doing?

[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:39.140]
Okay.

[00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:42.180]
You know, George was talking about the soft news on television.

[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.960]
Listen, I don't know what I do without Ben Ferrara

[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.620]
on Channel 10 in the morning to flip in her hair back,

[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.920]
tell her me how traffic's on build on the farm.

[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.340]
And it rained last night so the streets are going to be wet.

[00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:55.800]
I mean, without her, you know, I don't know why I'm doing that.

[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.000]
Yeah, life would be in keeping.

[00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:58.100]
It's my board on it.

[00:17:58.300 --> 00:17:58.480]
Mm-hmm.

[00:17:58.680 --> 00:17:59.640]
She's got high breasts.

[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:00.420]
Really?

[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:01.200]
They said that.

[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.360]
She's got Jeff Hyggress is what I'm hearing.

[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:04.080]
Oh.

[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:05.080]
Hey, QAM. Hello.

[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.040]
Hey, you.

[00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:07.060]
Who are you?

[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:07.680]
Okay.

[00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.140]
Hey, Lutton. Can we talk in impeachment?

[00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:11.640]
Yeah. Go right ahead.

[00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:12.100]
Please.

[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:13.960]
Say all you love. So somebody hears you.

[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.340]
Well, listen, this is what I'm thinking.

[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:17.080]
What's the point of impeaching a president?

[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.680]
You have to impeach an administration.

[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:19.240]
Yeah.

[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:20.900]
So you get rid of Bush.

[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:21.960]
You put Chani up there.

[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:22.820]
You get rid of Chani.

[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.380]
Then you get the guy that wants to speak or frisk.

[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:26.080]
You get rid of him.

[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.380]
Who the heck is going to run this car?

[00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.140]
You don't get frisk.

[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.260]
You get the, you don't get the sentiment.

[00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:30.900]
You're really going to get the house, uh,

[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.740]
major, you get that fat, uh, what's his name?

[00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:33.260]

[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.340]
Then he has to. Yeah.

[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:38.300]
All right. So this is the game when we win, send it back in November.

[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.920]
Well, why we get the death, the, well, me, me.

[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.340]
I'm personally going to work on it.

[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:42.520]
Yeah.

[00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:45.220]
And then, uh, with gets the guy from Nevada,

[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:46.000]
what's his name?

[00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:46.640]
Harry Reid.

[00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:47.000]
He's coming.

[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:47.600]
Harry and I will.

[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:48.140]
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

[00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:49.680]
He's about as powerful as Greg Reid.

[00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:50.920]
Okay. You keep working on a pal.

[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:51.740]
Let us know when you're done.

[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:52.120]
It's boring.

[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:53.860]
He's got a game plan.

[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:54.940]
Plan.

[00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:56.260]
Something like that.

[00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:57.920]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.080]
I'd rather hear from the guy with the eyes to be honest with him.

[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.960]
He's, uh, totally joking.

[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:03.780]
It's just a joke.

[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.900]
Yeah. Let me ask you how long you think he'd be on a year.

[00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:07.540]
How long do you think I'm going to show you on a year?

[00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:08.080]
Two years.

[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:08.320]
Two years.

[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:11.760]
Can you start it screaming, which would be in the second syllable in the upper three?

[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.600]
But you're picking on the big O for not knowing that.

[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.320]
That's terrible.

[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:20.960]
Well, he just got done saying that he's been listening to you for a hundred years.

[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.400]
No, no, he said that afterward.

[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:23.220]
He said that afterward.

[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:23.360]

[00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:24.240]
Don't you understand?

[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.420]
He probably wants that two to four slot.

[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:29.900]
So he wants me to go to bad form.

[00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:31.120]
And I got nothing against him.

[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:31.800]
I think he's okay.

[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:32.880]
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

[00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:35.280]
But then again, when it comes to sports, who cares anyway?

[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.880]
It might be more interesting if he didn't know what he was talking about.

[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.340]
At least in his room for controversy.

[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.200]
Oh, there's Ted Kennedy and John McCain.

[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:42.280]
I think they're going to do something.

[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:42.860]
Look at that.

[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.140]
And my team is so...

[00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:47.000]
So immigration compromised stalls in the Senate.

[00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:48.400]
I was just going to do that next.

[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:49.220]
No, I don't have fights.

[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:50.820]
And I'd over, we're going to recess.

[00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:52.960]
They're going to recess for a couple of weeks.

[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.020]
And then they're going to come back.

[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:58.300]
But I'm even a bit of a bit of up in two weeks after he's Easter and a face off recess.

[00:19:58.620 --> 00:19:59.980]
We believe we have the votes.

[00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:00.940]
Look at Ted.

[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:02.860]
Ted looks like he's going to take a nap standing up.

[00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:03.300]
Look at that.

[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.140]
He's got his head on John McCain's shoulder.

[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.340]
That's the way that he's going to get some functions.

[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:08.020]
You see that?

[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:08.660]
We should have last.

[00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:11.220]
I think he was holding himself up on McCain's shoulder.

[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.140]
He had lost about 100 pounds.

[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:15.000]
He's got a tea bag in him with this chin.

[00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:15.620]
Yeah.

[00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:16.720]
He kind of looks like a tea bag.

[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:21.380]
Colleges for all of their efforts on behalf of this worthy cause.

[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.740]
The issue is not over, but Ted says...

[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:27.560]
So first of all, I want to thank Senator McCain and...

[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:27.940]
Thank God.

[00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.640]
...of our colleagues, Republicans and Democrats of life.

[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:31.620]
Yeah, why do you screw it up?

[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:34.400]
The immigration bill, the big breakthrough is stalling.

[00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.580]
Now we have two week recess and they'll think about it.

[00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:37.260]
But it'll be pitiful.

[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.780]
They'll start counting Mexican heads and who's going to vote for this one and all this other.

[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:44.600]
Maybe they can give out some green cards and voting registration cards and some

[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.800]
die-bold computer information.

[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.100]
Don't forget the ratings diary.

[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:50.320]
And some ratings diary.

[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:51.080]
Still, that would be good.

[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.160]
Of course, we won't get any of those.

[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.400]
They'll all be voting for Radio Swabby cause now even in Mexicans are Colombians.

[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:57.640]
They're listening to Radio Catacole.

[00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:58.540]
Got a cool?

[00:20:58.840 --> 00:20:59.600]
Yeah, do have a cool.

[00:20:59.640 --> 00:20:59.840]
Thank you.

[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:00.340]
I'm John Blasper.

[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:01.720]
WKYM, hello.

[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:02.860]
Can we start now?

[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:03.820]
Can we start now?

[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:03.840]
Can we start now?

[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:04.240]
Sure.

[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.080]
What are you doing there?

[00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:06.940]
Excellent.

[00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:12.220]
The program through Radio Voice again and I appreciate you talking about my stock program.

[00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:13.580]
People are still talking about that.

[00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:14.420]
Who are you so-ching?

[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:15.540]
Oh my God.

[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:16.880]
How's everything?

[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.400]
Oh, jeez, you've got to be kidding me.

[00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.560]
Okay, so all you got to do is mention the name and there they are.

[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.140]
I've just popped right out of the list.

[00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:24.940]
I've got to do it up on Radio by the way.

[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.700]
I wanted to politics, believe it or not.

[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:27.540]
Politics.

[00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:29.720]
And now I've elected official.

[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:31.260]
Where's that?

[00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:33.620]
A new town called Coffin Bay.

[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:34.360]
Yeah.

[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.380]
I knew you'd make it big in a town that hasn't been invented yet.

[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:40.820]
See, they were ahead of your time.

[00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:42.560]
They just hadn't invented a place for you yet.

[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:43.500]
I can't have that.

[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.080]
I can't have tried everything.

[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:46.580]
They're going through a stocks journey.

[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:47.040]
It's good here.

[00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:47.400]
You okay?

[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:47.960]
Everything all right?

[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:49.160]
Yeah, everything's fine.

[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:52.000]
I guess just listen to everyone for a while.

[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:53.120]
I just wanted to say hi.

[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.940]
I wanted to wish you happy birthday.

[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.060]
Months and months to go.

[00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:58.040]
But I wasn't able to get to it, but I'll do it now.

[00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:00.440]
Well, happy birthday to you too whenever it is.

[00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:01.540]
Yeah, that's great.

[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:02.100]
Good process.

[00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:02.640]
See you early.

[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:03.280]
Take care of yourself.

[00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:05.480]
Go find us, socks, scroller form, a good guy or an associate.

[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.260]
Now, Ernie was a guest of mine back in the days when I did all that embarrassing radio,

[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.380]
even more embarrassing than QAM, which is saying a lot.

[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:14.540]
With all those guests, then Ernie used to come on and do biorathems.

[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:15.580]
He was his business.

[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:18.660]
He was peddling like electronic stuff and had those little biorathem calculators.

[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:19.200]
Okay.

[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:23.860]
And that was good, except for the fact that as soon as somebody would call in and Ernie would like to do,

[00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.040]
but to be able to do the little calculation there and all that.

[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.660]
Well, today your biorathem is a stink and don't go out of the house.

[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:30.920]
You're going to get run over by a truck or whatever it was.

[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.420]
And then of course, it's just like with psychics on here.

[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:37.980]
The phones go crazy, but as soon as somebody calls and hears their own personal, whatever it is,

[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:39.300]
at that point, they're gone.

[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:41.800]
Because who the hell cares about anybody else's deal, you know?

[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:42.080]
Right.

[00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:43.060]
We don't care about them.

[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:43.920]
We care about us.

[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.200]
So as far as listening to somebody else, we don't want to.

[00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:49.880]
But Ernie and of course, then I put them on the year to fill in,

[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.220]
which I think responsibility for that.

[00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:53.560]
I got them on here on weekends to do something to fill in.

[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.520]
Oh, and happy paysoft by the way Ernie too.

[00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:57.040]
Some was like a tennis player.

[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.340]
I forgot to ask them about his son.

[00:22:58.660 --> 00:22:59.280]
Probably this as well.

[00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:00.880]
26 past 10.

[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:01.680]
Look at that.

[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:02.720]
They're all lined up there.

[00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:03.360]
Who the hell we got?

[00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:04.660]
We had Ted Kennedy and McCain.

[00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:06.460]
Who's this and what they got on there?

[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:07.360]
This and the shot.

[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.220]
So that means they will go to the break to the Eastern Path over the back.

[00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:10.820]
They're going to the break.

[00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:11.900]
You ought to go to the break too, honey.

[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:12.320]
We are.

[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:14.340]
This is Neil.

[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.380]
Your rush of good kick to rush right on the back.

[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:17.120]
So we've faced.

[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.200]
5, 16, 18, 18.

[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.580]
You're well-steered.

[00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:25.780]
The most controversial movie of our turn,

[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:28.520]
Martin Sporceses, the last temptation of Christ,

[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:31.360]
recently became available for home viewing on cassette.

[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.480]
Religious groups, lifted the release of the film theatrically,

[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:37.060]
became outraged on the event of its home distribution.

[00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:39.480]
And so, for your spiritual edification,

[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.320]
and for those who don't have these serons on a Chrysler movie ticket,

[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.280]
we are proud to present, live,

[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.800]
part one, the radio version of Martin Sporceses,

[00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:49.620]
the last temptation of Christ.

[00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.560]
Oh, ah, hey, what?

[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:53.080]
What?

[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:54.420]
Want to buy a half-starrier?

[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.760]
Ah, ah, gee, I better not.

[00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:57.540]
Okay.

[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.880]
And so, the controversy continued.

[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:04.620]
Two days tomorrow from Martin Sporceses,

[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.920]
the second-blast temptation of Christ.

[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:07.560]
So, guess what?

[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.760]
We thought that Judas is scary.

[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:09.460]
It was a bad guy.

[00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:10.440]
Now, he's a good guy.

[00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:13.280]
Just like Galileo, we thought he was a little bit like that.

[00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:14.560]
Now, we apologize.

[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.120]
He was, he had a stomach on it.

[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:18.260]
977 votes already.

[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:18.860]
Aren't you impressed?

[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:21.220]
It's not even, I will have our thousand before 11 o'clock,

[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.780]
long before 11 o'clock.

[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:23.540]
Aren't you excited?

[00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:24.860]
You want to write this in your memoirs?

[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:28.540]
Ah, this in 40 cents, I'll buy about a half a cup of coffee at Starbucks.

[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.060]
A coffee late day.

[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:33.720]
I just, that whole coffee thing sounds awfully good to me.

[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:35.820]
979 votes.

[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.320]
What do you watch Katie Kuerk?

[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.560]
I mean, this is supposed to be bigger than God and Judas is scary at put together.

[00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:42.820]
What do you watch Katie on the CBS evening news?

[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:46.920]
Like Andy really said, he doesn't know anybody at CBS that he's coming here.

[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:49.580]
He likes it personally, but you know, forget about it.

[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000]
980, like I said.

[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:53.280]
Don't watch network news, 314.

[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.640]
32% of this audience, even this newsy audience,

[00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:00.340]
even this audience has been putting up with all these news stories that you forced me to read.

[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:02.240]
And that's going to come to a screeching halt.

[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.420]
Just like I used to do it, we don't want to hear one there, a couple.

[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:06.000]
That's it.

[00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:08.300]
Who wants here some fat, like Tom Jiccher wrote,

[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:11.020]
who wants to hear some fat old faggot sitting in his underwear in Toronto,

[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:13.080]
reading stories out of the newspaper on the radio?

[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:14.020]
What kind of a show is that?

[00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:15.900]
How much entertainment value is there in that?

[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:21.580]
It's supposed to talk about something important like sports and shack and shack and shack.

[00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:23.560]
And oh, and that too well.

[00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:24.620]
That goes without saying.

[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.300]
Oh, in other words, you hear that Josh?

[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:27.380]
Mark it down the time.

[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:28.440]
He's poo-pooing the calls.

[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:29.480]
Cock-a-kaw.

[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.520]
Already, already we had Ernie Sochin on there.

[00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:33.960]
It's only 1032 for Craig.

[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:34.780]
Well, that was a rare treat.

[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:36.420]
That was a rare treat.

[00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:37.460]
I told Josh that he had moody.

[00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:39.060]
He had woody on it.

[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.900]
And the big go-head, the guy with the eyes.

[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:42.460]
Right.

[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.080]
It's going to be hard to top that.

[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.760]
Maybe my spindle will call in today.

[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:46.580]
You never know.

[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.300]
Maybe Stanley J. Cohen will call in.

[00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:50.480]
Or Dave Ryder.

[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.500]
I wonder if some of these people are still alive.

[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:53.800]
Dave Ryder.

[00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:55.340]
I wonder if he was kind of CC Ryder.

[00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:56.120]
He's a pretty good guy.

[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.420]
He hired me at WINZ.

[00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:59.480]
And then right after that, he got canned.

[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:00.640]
Is there a side of this fella?

[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:01.400]
Who?

[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.260]
There's that of this.

[00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:03.620]
Or a spider, man.

[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:04.500]
I don't know if he's still around.

[00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:06.060]
Hopefully he's asleep through the fishes.

[00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:07.180]
God.

[00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:09.060]
Just stop and think about all the...

[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:11.060]
Oh, brother, was that a station or what?

[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.240]
No, and seriously, that was the station

[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.360]
for the radio groupies, for the talk show groupies.

[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:16.360]
The light bulb.

[00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:18.680]
With Norma Kent and Mr. Ego.

[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.200]
And Craig Worthing, who kept getting screwed over bad there

[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.160]
and shoved on late at night.

[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.180]
And Rick Spider-Man.

[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:24.440]
And Joyce Kaufman.

[00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:26.360]
And then a whole succession of people didn't belong in here.

[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:27.620]
Not to mention Mark Shimbomb.

[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:28.580]
He remember he called in.

[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:29.480]
Oh, yeah.

[00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:30.480]
That was kind of a person.

[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.120]
It's a who you.

[00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:33.420]
It was he who also was to know who he is,

[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:34.620]
which is kind of embarrassing.

[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:36.860]
I think there's more people in this audience

[00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:38.840]
know who he already so-tune was than Mark Shimbomb.

[00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:41.320]
Not that you're a bad guy, Mark, but don't call me again.

[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:42.180]
Oh, let's see.

[00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:44.240]
Will you watch Katie Couric on the CBS evening news?

[00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:46.080]
Don't watch Network News 315.

[00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:48.400]
Katie Couric blows 251.

[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.040]
That was my vote and I second that emotion.

[00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:50.980]
She sucks.

[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:52.740]
Don't watch CBS now.

[00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:53.680]
Won't watch her either.

[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:54.740]
225.

[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:55.940]
I hate this poll.

[00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:56.600]
64.

[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.580]
Watch other Network News now.

[00:26:58.820 --> 00:26:59.540]
But we'll watch her.

[00:26:59.640 --> 00:26:59.940]
62.

[00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:00.840]
All right.

[00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:01.580]
Let's move on.

[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.420]
Slyther yourself on the Ashley Heart.

[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:03.880]
You idiot.

[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:05.040]
Watch CBS now.

[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:06.020]
And we'll continue watching.

[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:06.500]
We'll watch her.

[00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:06.820]
61.

[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:08.140]

[00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:02.460]

[00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:03.520]
I checked the hare fina,

[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:03.520]

[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:03.520]

[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:03.520]

[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:03.540]
but it's hard

[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:03.540]

[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:06.560]
You have to have a basket first 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:08.700]
Oh, but you know what time of year it is though, don't you?

[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:10.060]
It's Easter basket time.

[00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:14.300]
Now there is such a thing that I just dream it or what is in an Easter basket?

[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:19.640]
Easter eggs, candy, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate bunnies.

[00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:20.740]
Chocolate little bunnies.

[00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:23.500]
Well, let me ask you, what is the bunny have to do with Easter?

[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:24.640]
We went over this.

[00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:25.740]
It's a symbol of fertility.

[00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:27.360]
It's a pagan symbol of fertility.

[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:28.320]
It's a Pagan.

[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:28.480]

[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:29.800]
It used to play shortstop for the parents.

[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:32.840]
The Christians in order to stop the pagans in.

[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:36.940]
Decorated all of their holidays with pagan trappings to kind of draw that in.

[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:39.720]
And the bunny and the eggs are symbol of fertility.

[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:40.900]
Well, isn't that sweet?

[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:42.020]
Having nothing to do with yush.

[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:44.820]
In other words, making babies like rabbits, which I've always said.

[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:45.260]
That's right.

[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:46.800]
Or my rats and eggs.

[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:47.880]
Do I have to explain that?

[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:48.360]
No.

[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.020]
Hey Neil, how you doing buddy?

[00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:51.880]
All right, pal.

[00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:54.680]
And you, up, up and only we're missing you.

[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:56.780]
Oh yeah, oh there's another re-tard.

[00:40:57.140 --> 00:41:02.880]
5.670560 and the reason I'm for you too is Bernie gets to say, and another one north to charge.

[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:04.080]
They're not missing you.

[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:04.660]
I'll tell you that.

[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:07.280]
That's what a Dick Feinberg told me if we ever see that guy again.

[00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:07.860]
But I've been.

[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:09.480]
WCWAM hello.

[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:12.340]
Hey, Q. Yes sir.

[00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:14.380]
We revolutionized radio and stuff.

[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:19.680]
What's the story with him lately where he fades off of the year?

[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:20.080]
That's me.

[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:22.040]
Oh, and that's you popping him down.

[00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:23.040]
I just got a fade amount.

[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:27.500]
I thought maybe he was like losing contact with the holes in the phone.

[00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:30.400]
I was thinking their cell phone doesn't get a full charge going.

[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:31.820]
Yeah, that maybe that's the second.

[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:33.620]
Or maybe it's the holes in the head that he's speaking through.

[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:34.160]
I'm not really sure.

[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.780]
But Josh is like, it went into he just pots you out.

[00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:37.660]
Is what it is.

[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:39.900]
It's subconsciousness from what I can see.

[00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:40.220]
He just.

[00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:41.040]
Double the way in.

[00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:41.280]
Hello.

[00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:42.300]
Neil?

[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:43.280]
Yes sir.

[00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:45.100]
Uh, do you know what is the joke?

[00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:46.320]
Try to keep it clean.

[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:48.160]
Do you know what Easter brought me?

[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:49.460]
Okay, we don't do Joe County show.

[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:49.840]
Okay, sir.

[00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:52.280]
Call the Ted Mackinac Foundation for the amateur hour.

[00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:53.300]
What was that?

[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:54.160]
Pathetic or what?

[00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:56.740]
See, I told you, open these phones wide up, baby.

[00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:58.060]
Put it on full throttle.

[00:41:58.280 --> 00:41:58.620]
Yeah.

[00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:00.440]
This business in here all the way.

[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:02.340]
I do have this very important to the media.

[00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:05.520]
Not although a representative Jane Harmon, Democratic California,

[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:08.720]
American Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee has called your

[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:09.960]
presently leaker in chief.

[00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:13.660]
She says if this disclosure is true, my scooter Libby, that is it's

[00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:14.120]
breathtaking.

[00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:18.540]
The leaker in chief, he's the leaker and an ad na ha that come that the story will be

[00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:19.000]
under tomorrow.

[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:20.800]
I thought Josh gets with it.

[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:23.120]
He calls, he says, Bush takes a leak.

[00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:24.540]
That's a headline on this story.

[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:25.600]
Oh, Joyce, I'm sorry.

[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:27.220]
We can Bush takes a leak.

[00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:31.420]
A British judge has rejected claims that US author Dan Brown plagiarized the work of two

[00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:33.580]
historians and his best selling out of the Da Vinci code.

[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:36.300]
He's rejected it when in doubt he threw the charges out.

[00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:41.620]
He's rejected the copyright infringement claim by Michael Beijon and Richard Lee,

[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:46.240]
whoever they are, who said that Brown blockbuster appropriated the Brown blockbuster

[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:50.200]
appropriated the architecture of the 82 book Holy Blood Holy Grail and now they're saying

[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:51.020]
holy moly.

[00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:53.400]
And I'll tell you what else they're going to be saying really soon.

[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:54.300]
Oh, wow.

[00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:57.740]
Today's verdict shows that this claim was utterly without merit.

[00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:00.820]
I'm still astonished at these two authors chose to file a suit at all, Brown's

[00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:02.060]
entertainment, according to the AMP.

[00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:03.260]
So that's it.

[00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:06.260]
They threw out that lawsuit and go out there and buy the Da Vinci code about a beat,

[00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:06.920]
but it moved, put it up.

[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:08.200]
And you decide, is it you?

[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:08.720]
This is scary.

[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:09.520]
It was in Jesus.

[00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:11.140]
Was it Mark Anthony?

[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:12.460]
Was it Anthony?

[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:13.160]
What's his name?

[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:13.660]
It can't sing.

[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:14.160]
What is it?

[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:14.660]
Mark Anthony.

[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:15.220]
Right.

[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:16.700]
Couldn't this thing as well as a paper sack?

[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:17.500]
Oh, look at that.

[00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:21.380]
Schlazer accused of cutting off the arms of, there's a story sitting around CNN.

[00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:25.020]
Found Dina Swasser holding a bloody...

[00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:25.760]
Look at this guy.

[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:27.600]
I mean, is this the way you do the newscast?

[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.500]
I don't know what this guy's name is.

[00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:29.780]
Okay.

[00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:30.720]
And if I say something, it'll be...

[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:31.920]
You always think we put it back on there.

[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:34.420]
Oh, it'll be the conservative and very grateful thing.

[00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:35.600]
He's terrible.

[00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:37.540]
He is just awful this guy.

[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:40.900]
He's another one that was hyperventilating about that just in a very vivid air.

[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.100]
Oh, can you believe that?

[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:43.320]
Yeah, I believe it.

[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.660]
Yeah, that they're a little faggot horse.

[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:45.700]
Right, that's right.

[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:46.100]
Well, how'd I talk about that?

[00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:46.880]
5-6, 7-8.

[00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:49.980]
You know, when you offer to go online, make it and do sexual things.

[00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:51.480]
There'll be a whole bunch of people out there.

[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:52.360]
Oh, yeah, how much you want.

[00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:53.820]
You know, make no mistake about it.

[00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:56.180]
The world is full of loony tunes.

[00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:59.500]
And believe me, you're here in the monitor showing you're going to hear a lot more of them in weeks to come.

[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:03.880]
We're going to get those numbers back up there because the rest of the stations in the Cranperman, we're in the tank.

[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:05.480]
QA and that's our motto now.

[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:08.220]
In fact, we're going to have a new Billboard campaign coming up.

[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:09.980]
It just shows the tank of a toilet bowl.

[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:11.580]
Not the seat. That would be tacky.

[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:12.400]
You know, just a tank.

[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:14.120]
And the caption...

[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:15.240]
It could be a variety of captions like,

[00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:17.700]
tanks a lot for putting us at the bottom or something like that.

[00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:19.120]
You know, or we're in the tank.

[00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:19.860]
I still like that.

[00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:23.260]
But of course, have no fear because Joe Bell is off the Naples now.

[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:24.800]
They're putting their heads together over there.

[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:27.300]
About to be put about there having big powwows.

[00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:28.720]
He's taking care of George.

[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:30.020]
He's taking care of Josh.

[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:32.440]
And you know, he's making up stories.

[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:33.620]
There's all kinds of stories.

[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:34.920]
He's schmoozing.

[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:37.060]
I guarantee he's doing a lot of back slapping over there.

[00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:37.880]
QA and hello.

[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:38.900]
Hey, no, how you doing?

[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:39.560]
Pretty good.

[00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:40.380]
Hey, no, no.

[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:43.280]
Yesterday on CNN, I heard the Congresswoman, I guess,

[00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:45.480]
and she's from California that called the president, Leaker and Chief.

[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:47.320]
That's why I just said Jane Harmon, yes.

[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:51.220]
Right. I have a problem with that because it's like, is this...

[00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:55.420]
It's like they're trying to say like little slick things or little wise cracks about it.

[00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:56.900]
But this is a very serious situation.

[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:59.680]
And it's like, would that be where that revelation coming out in the...

[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:04.920]
I don't see the little crashes doing themselves any justice by kind of making it a little

[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:05.800]
wise cracks about it.

[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:09.220]
I think they should have been out there raising hair like I saw on Schumer doing a little bit.

[00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:09.980]
Yeah.

[00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:12.040]
I think it's a very serious situation.

[00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:13.220]
And I think...

[00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:16.380]
That's what we need to go for justice, man.

[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:17.200]
Don Corleyon.

[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:18.780]
It's just sad and it's crazy.

[00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:20.620]
It's just frustrating that you see this...

[00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:22.480]
You know, it's good that these things are coming out for...

[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:25.920]
One thing about the Democrats, man, they may not be good, but at least they're consistent, okay?

[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:26.120]
Yeah.

[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:26.620]
Var.

[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:27.720]
No pun.

[00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:28.740]
We have, but wait a minute.

[00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:30.860]
Let me tell you who's going to be opening up a big mouth.

[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:33.480]
There's the people, how are you, Dean, man?

[00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:34.440]
One thing that everyone's keeping...

[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:35.160]
One thing that they...

[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:37.160]
Once they turn him loose, man, look at her.

[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:38.080]
Yeah.

[00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:40.760]
But just to finish it, I'm just...

[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:46.520]
It's very frustrating, but it's good to see that these guys are not going to be able to just hide behind.

[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:48.020]
I do all this dirt in the high-to-hand.

[00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:49.640]
You know, throw rocks in the high-to-hand.

[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:50.440]
These are a lot of stuff.

[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:50.740]
I don't know.

[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:51.640]
I wish they never met Skit.

[00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:56.180]
They were going to try to put Scooter back on the Scooter and send his ass out into Uranus.

[00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:58.600]
I'm sending Frisk General, Crystal Frisnesia.

[00:45:58.860 --> 00:45:59.640]
There you go, me too.

[00:45:59.760 --> 00:45:59.980]
All right.

[00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:00.760]
Yeah, you're taking it easy, man.

[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:03.800]
Send him some flowers for St. Paddy's days.

[00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:04.180]
A little bit late.

[00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:04.820]
Send him some...

[00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:05.940]
One of the four leaf flowers.

[00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:07.500]
Or maybe you just send him some booze.

[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:08.680]
You get Irishman, right?

[00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:12.160]
I thought Ted Kennedy was going to like fall over right on McCain's shoulder there.

[00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:13.440]
And you, it was incredible.

[00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:14.280]
It was pretty cute.

[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:16.220]
I think those two got something going there.

[00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:19.320]
Maybe that's why McCain's cheek is all puffed up like that.

[00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:20.540]
And my Ted looks like...

[00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:22.600]
Maybe they're like exchanging oxygen or something.

[00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:28.260]
Because it looked like Ted, like they just sucked the oxygen out of his face

[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:30.240]
and then all went into that cheek of McCain.

[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:32.420]
Just remember what I told you about John McCain, okay?

[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:33.860]
Don't get BS by that clown.

[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:35.120]
This is this.

[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:35.940]
Funny and lonely.

[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:37.480]
And Tina's butter and jelly.

[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:40.080]
This is by 16 KF.

[00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:44.880]
This is the Neil Roger show.

[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:47.620]
This is your brain.

[00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:49.140]
Go, go, go, go.

[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:49.720]
Go, go, go.

[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:50.560]
Any question?

[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:52.960]
I've been everywhere, man.

[00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:55.100]
I've been everywhere, man.

[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:57.220]
That's what I had my share, man.

[00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:58.800]
I've been everywhere.

[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:03.720]
I've been a Reno Scargo's Parko, Minnesota Buffalo's Toronto,

[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:05.460]
Wednesdays, Thursdays, Northern Wichita,

[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:06.460]
No more coffee.

[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:08.960]
Homegrown with that, a pound of my mat of a lot.

[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:36.440]
We're gonna shout Carolina and Oklahoma and Arizona

[00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:42.120]
We're gonna shout Carolina and Michigan

[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:44.220]
And Lake Devon Lake, traitor Lake East Lake

[00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:46.200]
I'm in a great way, man

[00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:48.420]
I'm in a great way, man

[00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:50.620]
I'm in a great way, man

[00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:52.720]
I'm in a great way, man

[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.520]
And then we're gonna watch it in East China

[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:55.520]
Take back the workouts

[00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:56.620]
Yeah!

[00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:58.100]
Come get him, boy

[00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:00.520]
He was on the boat from a full-foot screen together

[00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:01.740]
in the situational room

[00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:03.180]
and he just really ripped an ass

[00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:04.820]
and we'll come back back back back

[00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:06.180]
but the government are dean

[00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:08.320]
and he just ripped an ass again

[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:09.300]
and just kept the bop-up

[00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:09.960]
and he had the...

[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:11.240]
We all had that same look of

[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:12.980]
like what do I do now on this face, you know?

[00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:14.300]
In a situation room

[00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:16.480]
What a wimp, what a worst, man

[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:19.340]
I guarantee you he hasn't got any unit

[00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:20.820]
He don't have the mail, remember

[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:21.500]
I guarantee you that

[00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:22.180]
We'll flip-scree

[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:24.940]
Okay, I'm gonna change the pool at the noon

[00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:27.080]
because the one from today stays up all weekend

[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:28.940]
and we already know about this Katie Kirk thing

[00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:30.080]
It's boring, you know?

[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:31.480]
So I'll try it in the morning

[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:34.320]
More of these traction, more stuff and nonsense

[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:35.420]
Yeah, that's right

[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:36.840]
Who cares whether it's Katie Kirk

[00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:37.960]
reading off the teleprompter

[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:39.760]
or old 85,000-year-old

[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:40.940]
but a funny idea about you

[00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:41.900]
What do you mean by that?

[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:42.160]
What do you mean by that?

[00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:44.620]
I mean Elizabeth Vargas is just fine there

[00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:46.080]
She... you know, she looks okay

[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:47.340]
and she reads fairly well

[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:47.840]
She don't...

[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:49.340]
She don't fumble like Lou Dobbs

[00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:51.420]
Fumpy and bumble and stumble and bumble

[00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:53.720]
and that should be kind of a prerequisite

[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:55.200]
for doing anchor news now

[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:55.980]
as being able to read

[00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:57.500]
Being able to read the teleprompter

[00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:58.360]
That would help

[00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:00.240]
Here's the new pool for noon to two

[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:00.700]
Got it?

[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:02.920]
I'm writing it down, I'll fix it there

[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:04.400]
because I'm on top of things today, man

[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.060]
You're under a lot of pressure and stress

[00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:07.860]
I'll do you got a nice vacation next week

[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:09.080]
with a fan of it

[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:11.280]
It might be nice if I can get a hold of somebody up in the hill

[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:12.220]
so I don't have to go up there

[00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:13.580]
No, you got to go all the way up to North Carolina

[00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:14.920]
Right, I'm going to see you guys get away

[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:15.100]
I'm going to see you guys get away

[00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:15.300]
It's going to get away

[00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:15.900]
It's going to get away

[00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:15.960]
It's going to get away

[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:17.160]
Thanks for leaving the heater on, Ma

[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:18.320]
Ma, well don't let that...

[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:20.440]
That'll teach you to let Ma go up there, okay?

[00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:22.780]
You know, you talk a good game all this hatred

[00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:24.240]
You get a miserable old bitch

[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:25.480]
but you let her go up there

[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:27.580]
Let her go up there

[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:29.160]
I would change the locks and the bagels

[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:29.900]
How do you like that?

[00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:30.480]
That's a good idea

[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:31.740]
Yeah, change the locks

[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:33.140]
When that bitch goes all the way up there

[00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:34.280]
Oh, guess what Ma, sorry

[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:35.480]
It's a lockout

[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:36.900]
It's a lockout Ma

[00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:38.040]
And she would say

[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:39.100]
Thank you very much

[00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:39.900]
And you'd say your mama

[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:40.940]
All right, here's the poll

[00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:42.880]
And listen, we all got our issues, okay?

[00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:43.580]
Yeah

[00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:44.960]
Who should get...

[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:46.620]
Well, my mother ain't going to bother me anymore

[00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:47.580]
That's all I can tell you

[00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:49.200]
She's not going to nag, she's not going to confess

[00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:51.640]
I wouldn't surprise me if I start having dreams

[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:52.480]
Nails

[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:53.380]
Oh, brother

[00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:55.040]
I told you that one day I'm on vacation

[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:56.720]
My vacation started on a Friday

[00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:59.040]
And it got to be like 10-0-2

[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:00.880]
10-0-2 on a Friday morning

[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:03.160]
I'm in bed, I'm resting, I'm sleeping late

[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:05.020]
Okay, I'm enjoying the first day of vacation

[00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:05.880]
Well deserved

[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:07.020]
And the phone rings

[00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:08.120]
And I run out of the...

[00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:09.360]
Because I don't have any phone in my bedroom

[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:11.400]
And I run out of the other room and I pick up the phone

[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:13.200]
Nails, what's wrong?

[00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:15.340]
And I said, I'm on vacation

[00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:16.120]
Bitch

[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:17.460]
I didn't say bitch

[00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:17.940]
But I was sure

[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:18.220]
Oh

[00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:20.520]
Okay, here's the poll new to two

[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:22.800]
Who should get the permanent 2-4 slot on QAM?

[00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:23.580]
What's your thing?

[00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:25.380]
I mean, we might as well take care of this on this show

[00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:27.420]
Because management's here don't seem inclined to do anything

[00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:29.360]
They're like paralyzed

[00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:31.100]
Emotionally and mentally

[00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:33.620]
And spiritually, they're spiritually paralyzed

[00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:35.260]
That's the problem with this crowd we got now

[00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:36.420]
I got your manage

[00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:37.700]
Gildi

[00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:39.440]
I'm going to write these down as I'm saying them

[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:39.860]
Curtis

[00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:41.240]
The big O

[00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:43.660]
He was sucking up to me this morning so I better put him on

[00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:46.460]
Remember that about how he's been listening since he was a child

[00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:46.740]
Right

[00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:48.880]
I think what he was trying to say is that I'm old but he's right

[00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:49.880]
Who else?

[00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:51.340]
Kimba

[00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:52.400]
Kimbo camper

[00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:53.240]
God forbid

[00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:54.460]
Oh my God

[00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:56.220]
I like him a lot but God he's so boring

[00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:57.880]
Who else we got around?

[00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:59.300]
Oh, Lenny Martez

[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:00.640]
Len Martez

[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:01.420]
The Crow

[00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:03.780]
Experienced or winning is all about that

[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:05.240]
The Crow

[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:07.520]
Show, the Crow Show, the bow show

[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:09.040]
Showing off, the bow show

[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:11.740]
What about bring back Moe?

[00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:12.440]
I'm putting that on there

[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:13.720]
Bring back Moe

[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:13.860]
Huh?

[00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:16.520]
I mean, he ain't coming back but bring back Moe

[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:17.580]
You never know Moe

[00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:18.800]
Maybe he's got some more naked pictures

[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:19.300]
I don't know

[00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:20.820]
You bring back Moe?

[00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:21.640]
Oh my leave it on

[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:22.700]
I heard a start from the beginning

[00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:23.880]
Joe and Joe Zagaki

[00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:25.780]
Joe Zagaki by Cracky

[00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:29.200]
He could crack a point to share on the bottom side of it

[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:31.000]
So that's what I'm going to face that there

[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.260]
And we'll put that up for the weekend

[00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:33.420]
Maybe they got some other suggestions

[00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:34.440]
How about Ernie Sochin?

[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:35.300]
Let's put him on there

[00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:37.500]
Ernie Sochin could do some biorathems

[00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:38.840]
Maybe do a show on socks

[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:39.540]
Huh?

[00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:40.600]
You never know

[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:41.600]
How about Reverend Jones?

[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:43.100]
I'll tell you one thing

[00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:44.120]
If we're getting more for this show

[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:45.280]
I vote for it

[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:46.180]
It won't

[00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:46.780]
It won't

[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:50.500]
Oh, she invited him to your house to do the show with you

[00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:51.640]
No, you try that

[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:51.880]
No

[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:53.780]
Fighters, you have no command to be

[00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:54.000]
I'm sorry Reverend

[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.640]
Tom 560 on the...

[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:56.560]
Yeah, we got something for it

[00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:57.560]
You left your charge

[00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:59.320]
On the Verizon Singular Wireless Lines

[00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:00.880]
It's all a call of pride, man

[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:02.480]
The leak you're in chief, my ass

[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:08.320]
O'Lean Galexpert said the president of Bush had the unquestionable authority to approve the disclosure of sequenced CIA information reporters

[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:10.840]
But, but, added the leak was highly unusual

[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:13.980]
And amounted to using sensitive intelligence data for political gain

[00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:15.940]
And I'd like this to be something surprise, you know

[00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:17.340]
The old smear and shmere

[00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:18.340]
It's all I know how to do

[00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:19.620]
Smear and shmere

[00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:21.940]
Whether it was Paulo Neal or Richard Clark

[00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:25.600]
Or Joe Wilson, no matter who it is, smear and shmere

[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:27.640]
Across us, we're going to shmere your ass

[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:28.340]
How do you like that?

[00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:30.280]
So this is like something surprise, you know

[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:31.900]
W.A.Q.Y.M. Hello

[00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:33.660]
It's the Carl Rove FN Way

[00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:34.380]
Q.A.M.

[00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:35.880]
Not there, that line one

[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:37.900]
And there's actually the contact was made

[00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:38.320]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:40.400]
In other words, it wasn't the usual line one, it's a shame

[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:41.720]
W.A.Q.Y.M. Hello

[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:43.800]
Q.A.M. Ola

[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:45.480]
Q.A.M.

[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:48.940]
Hey, is this new or...

[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:50.980]
Who's this?

[00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:54.140]
This is Mike from Boca

[00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:56.340]
Oh, let's go to Mike and Boca, how you doing Mike?

[00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:57.460]
Yeah, how's it going?

[00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:03.080]
I was just looking at the Q.A.M. website last night

[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:04.320]
Nettel, did you pick yours?

[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:05.500]
Yeah, we sure are, Glee

[00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:06.280]
And I...

[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:08.060]
I didn't know you were a profile

[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:11.380]
They put your salary, I was wondering what the deal was

[00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:14.760]
No, they didn't put my salary, I'm sorry, I hate to break the news, you didn't put my salary

[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:19.080]
Well, I mean they said that you make one point whatever a million a year

[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:20.160]
Not that another thing

[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:23.020]
I was wondering why would they do that?

[00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:25.860]
You were calling for a loan, is that it? Call friendly Bob

[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:28.580]
No, I'm wondering why would they do that?

[00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:31.500]
Why would they put your salary on there?

[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:34.780]
I don't think that my salary is on there to be honest with you if it is

[00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:35.700]
I mean you're a profile

[00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:37.640]
I'm in the Q.A.M. website

[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:40.840]
Yeah, because we want to rub your nose in it, that's why

[00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:43.300]
All right, I was...

[00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:44.260]
Go rub your nose in it

[00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:46.600]
5, 6, 7, what is he talking about?

[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:48.160]
I didn't hear a word about that

[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:49.460]
Is that on the Q.A.M. website?

[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.420]
I'm just touching it in right now, you don't have to play no music, I'm right here

[00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:58.260]
Okay, let's see, our hosts

[00:53:58.260 --> 00:53:59.800]
Okay, our hosts

[00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:03.980]
You're right, oh that's the Harold article, you see this is a moron

[00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:07.940]
That's an idiot, check out the Harold article and we're going to help you check it out

[00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:10.540]
I'm trying to click on it, but the Harold article is on it, I guess, huh?

[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:14.140]
Click here, and there's the Kevin Baxter article and it says right there

[00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:16.500]
You know, that's the article from my 30th anniversary, okay?

[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:19.900]
Kevin Baxter wrote that, Q.A.M. didn't put it on here, you moron

[00:54:20.420 --> 00:54:23.980]
Jesus, God, I mean if stupidity were like worth of billions, you'd be rich

[00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:25.940]
You could buy the whole universe, man

[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:29.260]
It says right on there what it is, it's the Kevin Baxter article

[00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:32.040]
It says, link to the Harold article, let's go, I mean, how come the hell did he put that?

[00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:35.680]
Because Kevin knows you, that's all, plus he's got to figure a little bit low anyway

[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:39.140]
If I was only making that much, I couldn't afford to support the whole universe, okay?

[00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:43.300]
Kevin, you idiot, you quizzling, but then against the Harold, expect them to get it right?

[00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:44.720]
No, no

[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:49.140]
Anyway, George will give you a loan, and then we checked it out today, Josh, George is the one with the big Baxter

[00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:51.380]
That's right, we learned it from each other

[00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:53.120]
Between you and me together, we came up with a star box

[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:57.000]
That I've made a couple of stops after work, George has got the big big bucks

[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.820]
He's got a load folder in his pants

[00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:02.080]
Yeah, and some money too

[00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:04.720]
Oh, God, load you some money

[00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:08.140]
595 volts, we're gonna have 1100 before the next break on that pool

[00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:11.320]
Man, we are kicking some serious big fat smelly ass today

[00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:15.160]
And I knew it, I could feel it when I got up this morning, I thought, oh, isn't it 140 yet?

[00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:17.100]
Is that what we were saying for a long time?

[00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:20.180]
George and I were commiserating me for this show, isn't it 155 yet?

[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:23.720]
Christ, I mean, Judas, somebody QAM, hello?

[00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:28.300]
So you see, if somebody calls you a Judas, now that's a compliment

[00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:32.180]
It used to be a real shot, you know, like a backstabber, and the big nose, Judas

[00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:36.540]
Yeah, right, Judas, Judas, somebody QAM, hello?

[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:39.380]
Oh, is this Mike and Bunkan, is this loan departed?

[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:42.740]
Yeah, I get loan from Mike

[00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:43.860]
How much you want?

[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:45.700]
Oh, I don't know, 5 bucks

[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:49.900]
Oh, 5 bucks, well, put a few zeros on him, and no sweat, he's got the big bucks Mike

[00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:53.200]
In Bokershmuck, no brains, just bucks, God

[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:54.840]
How come they had a faffada?

[00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:58.220]
Don't ask me, I didn't tell him to put it in there, you just make it up, okay?

[00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:01.600]
They feel like they know something, you know, by putting crap like they're in there

[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:04.340]
Nobody's business whether they're making 50 bucks or 50 million dollars

[00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:07.820]
Okay, believe me, talking to the people in this bowzo town for 30 years

[00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:11.740]
Whatever I'm making, it ain't enough, trust me when I tell you, and even close to enough

[00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:15.960]
In fact, when Joel Belga is back from over on a West Coast, I got some real interesting news for him

[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:18.780]
Crank that number up, then I'll take care of you guys, okay?

[00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:22.420]
I'll take good care of my people, just like chicken neck there, don't let him down, do I?

[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:25.880]
Take care of his pathetic little ass, and what's he gonna do once I'm not here, no more?

[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:29.040]
See, I keep asking that because you know as well as I do, he's in denial

[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:35.280]
Oh, jeez, yeah, well, this is a guy, this is a guy who was permanently suicidal before he started making a couple of bucks

[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:43.220]
And now, you know, now that he's got this house, don't buy a house, I told you that if you're in any way connected with this radio business, don't buy a house

[00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:47.180]
That's my best piece of advice for you, okay? Like somebody once said, don't buy a house

[00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:49.240]
Amen, who the hell was that by the way?

[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:50.480]
What's some collar, wasn't it?

[00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:53.540]
Yes, yes, I think what we ought to do, maybe I'll do it today

[00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:57.080]
Is go through this thing, maybe they just aren't that many of mine, I don't know

[00:56:57.080 --> 00:57:00.560]
Because there's just too much other stuff, you know what I mean? To find those?

[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:02.640]
What is this?

[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:03.180]
What is this?

[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:05.640]
I'm a priest, I'm a priest, I'm a priest

[00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:09.740]
Who is it? What's going on? I'm a priest!

[00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:11.160]
What's going on?

[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:12.460]
What's going on?

[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.040]
What's going on?

[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:16.360]
What's going on?

[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:17.680]
What's going on?

[00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:22.980]
Well, that's our new format for money, I guess I wasn't supposed to play that yet

[00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:25.700]
It wasn't surprised me, that's the only way we're going to get any numbers again

[00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:28.920]
And then in this market, man, nobody's speaking English, it is really scary

[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:31.940]
That last trend, how the hell did we do any good in that thing, huh?

[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:32.980]
Holy moly!

[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:35.840]
Talk about heavy duty, Espan, you know, that thing was like...

[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:39.260]
You were thought that that was the arbitrage from Havana, wouldn't you?

[00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:43.240]
You were the only one from Aliens home town, which you never know what that was, I keep asking you that

[00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:46.220]
And you don't know what it is, Mr. Ashkamygay, what?

[00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:48.180]
What, where does he live?

[00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:53.360]
Aliens, Cuba, no, no, I'm talking about, I want really onto zip code

[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:57.640]
I don't keep track, I do know he stole my birthday and on the baby Jesus

[00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:01.620]
No, I think you're more like Judas, I think you talk behind my back

[00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:07.420]
Yeah, 12 minutes after you're 11, I say you keep a crappy company, that's what I say

[00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:12.880]
Oh yeah, here we go, here we go, starting all over again, let's go right at it

[00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:14.280]
Before your vacation, okay?

[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:16.860]
Let's get into a big knockout on Dragout Brawl on the air

[00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:18.780]
About who I keep company with

[00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:21.400]
I keep company with good people, that's why I'm far from down there

[00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:23.700]
So I'm not keeping company with any of the people you're thinking about

[00:58:24.140 --> 00:58:24.900]
How do you like that?

[00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:25.720]
That's a good play

[00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:28.180]
A couple of more coming here next week, briefly

[00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:31.820]
Hey, here's a silly question, if you tried the pizza and pasta, John and Bakers

[00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:36.280]
Well, certainly George and Josh have, in fact, they got John and Bakers food coming out of their body parts

[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:40.600]
And they still can't get enough, because John and Bakers is the best Italian restaurant

[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:44.180]
This side of the university drive and now two great locations for you

[00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:48.320]
Brand new in the Sterling Town center on Sterling Road, just west of Pine Island, road and Cooper City

[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:52.200]
And the classic John and Bakers in Pember Pines, just west of Flamingo

[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:56.400]
And the home depot center on Pine's Boulevard, they call it that because they carry Coca-Cola classic

[00:58:56.400 --> 00:59:00.800]
And let me tell you the food is absolutely great, huge forces of your favorite home style Italian Delights

[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:05.120]
Plus, with John and Bakers lower, low prices, you can take the whole family there for lunch and dinner

[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:08.480]
Even Josh and I could afford to go there today and stay well within your budget

[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:11.220]
It doesn't cost you a fortune to go have a great meal at John and Bakers

[00:59:11.220 --> 00:59:14.760]
And when you go there, just mention to your wife, just give you a free half dozen of John and Bakers

[00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:18.520]
World Famous Garlic Rules, you won't believe how big and how good and juicy they are

[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:22.860]
Take out or dine in tonight, for take out in Pember Pines calls around the Baker at 9.5.4

[00:59:22.860 --> 00:59:28.580]
4.3.143.15 and by the way they don't use industrial style sauce out of a can

[00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:33.040]
So you're not going to be on the can all day when you eat there, the food is fantastic and good for you too

[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:39.020]
In Pember Pines call 9.5.4, 4.3.143.15 or in Cooper City call 9.5.4

[00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:41.480]
2.5.2.0.09.1

[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:44.820]
9.5.4.25.2.0.09.1 in Cooper City

[00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:49.440]
The best pizza in town pasta, beer chicken, sausage and peppers and all your favorite subs

[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:52.740]
Man, it doesn't get any better than John the Baker, the best in town

[00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:55.140]
This is Neil Rogers

[00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:59.180]
This is 5.62.8

[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:03.360]
Friday you best

[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:11.300]
Donald, I understand that Melania's breastfeeding and her breasts are huge

[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:14.420]
Yes, bigger, better, stronger, more beautiful

[01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:15.500]
You gotta be thrilled

[01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.920]
I am, they're both very, very fascinating

[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:20.060]
I have a good relationship with Melania

[01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:21.400]
And we have a lot of fun

[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:23.800]
It sounds like it, Melania, your thoughts?

[01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:25.620]
I'm supposed to be here

[01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:27.720]
Okay, she's having fun

[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:30.000]
And so my friend, I can imagine

[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.160]
Are you in prison?

[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:34.040]
Okay, I get the idea

[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:36.160]
I don't know

[01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:40.380]
Melania, is it any fun for you?

[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:41.700]
I don't think so

[01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:43.260]
It's all I can say

[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:45.960]
Okay, I'm a little off my ear

[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:47.780]
Because I'm faxing that the second-folder

[01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:50.420]
Can you hear it dialing in the background in my fax machine?

[01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:52.480]
My fax machine works by the way

[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:53.700]
Or is this sometimes?

[01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:55.760]
Yeah, when they paid the bill, you mean long distance

[01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:58.360]
Okay, said anybody was out the middle of the week

[01:00:58.360 --> 01:00:59.600]
You missed them really excited there

[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.860]
Because the beastly's hadn't paid the long distance phone bill

[01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:04.260]
As a result, no phone in the company would dial long distance

[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:08.160]
And of course, maybe that's why they couldn't make payroll on time on the 5th too

[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:10.260]
5.670560, I'm down

[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:12.320]
And I think it's going to go through and if I hear that beat

[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.240]
If I hear like

[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:15.920]
You'll hear it one moment please

[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:17.860]
Come on, you can do it

[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:20.660]
Now, there it is

[01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:23.940]
That means it's an Eric's hands right now in the new poll too

[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:25.060]
Pulls an Eric's hands

[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:27.280]
1113 on this Katie Kirk thing

[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.380]
Would you watch Katie Kirk on a CBS evening news?

[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:30.800]
Because this is going off of there at noon

[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:33.220]
At noon we switch Eric, so hop on it

[01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:35.500]
Well, the other one's, you know, not that much work

[01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:36.880]
Will you watch here that bitch?

[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:38.640]
Don't watch evening news, network news 350

[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:40.860]
31.5% don't watch anyhow

[01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:43.200]
Katie Kirk blows 282

[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.400]
Don't sound too promising

[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.600]
Less, don't watch CBS news now

[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:48.420]
And we'll watch here either 252

[01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:50.580]
But you put those first three together, it's overwhelming

[01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:53.040]
Isn't it? You put those three cameras together

[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:55.060]
Got like 70-some-up percent

[01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:57.500]
Watch others now, but we'll watch here at 75

[01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:58.460]
They've given us a shot

[01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:01.360]
Watch CBS now and we'll continue, we'll watch here at 70

[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:03.640]
I hate this poll at 69

[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:06.080]
Watch CBS now but we'll not watch here at 15

[01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:08.380]
In other words, I think what they're saying is that

[01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:10.500]
The other ones, what they're saying is

[01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:12.140]
Could she be any worse than Bob Sheeper

[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:14.000]
At least she's a little easier on the eyes

[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.100]
And she's under the age of 100

[01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:16.640]
She just turned 64

[01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:19.620]
How do you like that guy with the advantage age thing

[01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:21.440]
Calling back again today? You know, it's just

[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:22.840]
I have no life

[01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:25.920]
It's just so plain for an innocent bystander

[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.460]
A child out there when I hear you people

[01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:30.540]
They have today trying to get a vicarious life

[01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:31.860]
You're calling this radio show

[01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:33.520]
Come on, you got to have something to be proud of

[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:34.840]
It's so sad

[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:37.280]
He was right, he was wrong, he was too quiet

[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:39.580]
He wasn't right either, he was also wrong

[01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:40.360]
I was right, he missed

[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:43.740]
He had misinformation and she still got skanky nasty

[01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:44.780]
100-year-old-looking feet

[01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:45.660]
Vanna

[01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:47.580]
You don't ever notice her feet, but nobody make it a part

[01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:50.200]
Well, she was under with their feet, they've been under the last week

[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:51.800]
See if you watch the show as close as I do

[01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:53.640]
Deputy QAM, hello

[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:55.060]
Yes, sir

[01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:57.020]
Of course God didn't create you

[01:02:57.020 --> 01:02:59.020]
Two parts collided in the big thing

[01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:01.060]
Yeah, huh, huh, Deputy QAM, hello

[01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:02.140]
Hi, Neil

[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:05.140]
I think that's a solution for your two to four hour

[01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:08.740]
Yeah, you set up a race in the cage fight to the death

[01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:11.240]
Between Len Martez and the crew

[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:14.920]
5-670560, 0.56 in the residence of Cedar Marbara

[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:16.720]
By the way, say how did you all find the workforce too?

[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:17.780]
You have been kissed on the cheek

[01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:20.420]
WDQAM, hello

[01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:21.580]
I know you need to talk

[01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:23.100]
Deputy QAM, hello

[01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:25.820]
It puts the basket in the lotion

[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:27.520]
WDQAM, hello

[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:28.980]
Hey George, yes

[01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:32.180]
Where's your house and the rest of your life? I'm going to make a mistake out there to heat off for you

[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:32.880]
What?

[01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:35.660]
Where's your house and the rest of your life? I'm going to read it here

[01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:39.220]
Right in between Sparta and West Jefferson, 4 miles south and out of Wilson

[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:41.540]
You know, I'm not West by Cherokee

[01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:43.880]
It's up in the other end of the park

[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:47.960]
Yeah, like you're going to give your address to the house up there to these people, but you know there won't be there no more

[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:50.300]
They've got no address, we just got directions up there

[01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:51.060]
There you go

[01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:53.080]
Just send him the key, he'll take good care of it

[01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:57.120]
We don't want to hear about it, I don't want to know

[01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:00.460]
I don't want to care, I don't want to hear about North Carolina, South Carolina

[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:03.240]
Nothing to be thinking about, I don't want to care about it

[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:04.580]
That's the way I feel about that

[01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:06.920]
Send West's name back there to WDQAM

[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:08.380]
This log is an embarrassment

[01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:10.700]
This log is an embarrassment

[01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:15.040]
Even like Moon Trine could put together a better log than this Chris, this is humiliated

[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:17.420]
But we got some real heavy hitters coming in the out bed

[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:21.620]
The beast and fat boy, those are the heavy hitters he was talking about

[01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:22.980]
Then you look for the iron gate

[01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:24.280]
Somebody QAM, hello

[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:25.440]
Neil, can I ask you something?

[01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:26.100]
No

[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:28.240]
Why does everybody always try my rap?

[01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:32.620]
Talking about my music when there's a crap like Kid Spoddowby, Durand DeWand

[01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:34.480]
Little Span Dex, there we thing happen

[01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:37.360]
Oh man, I need a closure on that rat

[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:38.560]
Not closed it

[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:41.820]
Somebody QAM, hello as enclosure, you have QAM, hello

[01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:43.720]
Hey Neil, yes sir

[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:48.980]
You know, it's really, really sucks man, the fact that in the toilet of your career you got this choice

[01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:50.340]
And you have to stop the troughs around your neck

[01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:53.040]
Yeah, and I'll go on like your clown

[01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:54.780]
And I'll tell you why

[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:58.160]
George Polly saw the family guy last weekend

[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:02.720]
They had like one minute of fat guys graduating on prime time

[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:04.980]
I mean different fart noises

[01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:05.540]
Sure

[01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:10.280]
You can't even put a drop in because this lady doesn't even know the fur on rules

[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:12.840]
And that sucks man, it's terrible

[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:14.000]
Because I'm looking at you forever

[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.160]
And you know, you're still entertaining but man, they take away a lot of your weapons you know?

[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:23.620]
That's right, well yeah, like Joe Bell said, how the hell can we expect you to do a show with your handside behind your back?

[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:26.180]
And of course my response to that is well, but don't expect much

[01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:28.720]
He's the one that said it, he's the new general man, man

[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:29.640]
He's over there in April's end

[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:32.180]
And I'm sure he's really fighting tooth and nail for us this weekend

[01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:33.680]
Not, not

[01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:36.640]
Well corporate says this, and George said that

[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:41.000]
Yeah, I have never seen such a wink in my life man or whatever she says he just bends right over

[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.060]
He just caves right in like a noodle spaghetti, you know that blood you get in your mouth

[01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:47.560]
Corporate, huh?

[01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:49.080]
Yes, well incorporate your eyes

[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:51.300]
That's what I have to say to them, corporate my ass

[01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:53.360]
And I can totally love her move and enjoy

[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:57.160]
And all the beeslees and anybody who ever like entered that building over there

[01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:01.060]
Man, oh there's the guy from Hollywood, Blood Holy Grail lost the Michael Beijing

[01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:02.640]
He lost his life

[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:04.860]
He's a good old and savour of the publisher

[01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:08.960]
He lost, you could be on the hook now for millions of dollars in legal fees

[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:10.720]
Are you sorry, you brought the case

[01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.280]
I'm not sorry I brought the case, it was a

[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:16.020]
We felt that we had created intellectual property

[01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:17.960]
Another constipated Brit no wonder

[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:21.680]
So his ass just based on the way he's talking, wouldn't you?

[01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:23.720]
Oh, he's also author of the Jesus papers

[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:25.660]
Yeah, he was a role in them

[01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:28.500]
In fact, I think both of these guys have been smoking them

[01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:29.660]
The Jesus papers my ass

[01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:32.360]
When you go into 7-11 just say can I get some Jesus papers

[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:35.480]
And then I want some of that good stuff like Sigourney Weaver wants

[01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:37.260]
I wonder Harris got the new podium

[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:39.760]
Let's see, oh yeah, you're something

[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:42.320]
I bet you within just seconds he put that up there

[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:44.000]
Because I am so psychic, it's scary

[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.620]
In fact, Monday we're going to be doing the Elijah's Psychic Show

[01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:47.840]
Calling for your own psychic being

[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:48.840]
Cost you 100 bucks though

[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:50.800]
Mike and Bokka will take care of the charges

[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:53.380]
In fact, we're going to get his credit card and just charge everybody

[01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:55.620]
Everybody's call on Monday and his credit card

[01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:58.460]
He's the big shooter up there, it's worried so much about how much I'm making

[01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:01.240]
Schmuck, I think we ought to change it right now, don't you?

[01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:03.140]
This Katie Curry pool I find very boring

[01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:04.800]
Yeah, I agree, I hate this boring

[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:07.020]
You know what, you know what's boring sports talk is boring

[01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:10.060]
Did that take you a long time ago that the day would come when all of it

[01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:13.080]
It's just not the one of those things that will run its course

[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:16.040]
You know, just like all the different music formats that come they go

[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:17.660]
Like that party radio, remember that?

[01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:19.540]
Yeah, I mean, did not tell you?

[01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:23.000]
I was the first one to tell you that this is going to last about six months

[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.460]
That's my opinion, that's my opinion

[01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:25.540]
This is the double 10

[01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:31.900]
The weakest excuse for a format to play in derude and what ever the other one was over again, huh?

[01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:32.760]
Safry do it

[01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:35.060]
Yeah, Safry do it in derude over and over again

[01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:37.320]
And I've got them both here by the way, I wouldn't play them

[01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:38.740]
That's my opinion, I'm like this

[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:39.720]
I mean, that's crap radio

[01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:41.220]
That's my opinion, I'm like this

[01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:42.780]
Have another drink Mike, man

[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:44.880]
WC feels in him, same guy

[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:45.980]
Okay, let's see

[01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:48.160]
Just put it out to find a result of this

[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:50.400]
That means I can switch the pool, isn't it tremendous power?

[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:51.380]
Don't you love when you do this?

[01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:51.940]
Mm-hmm

[01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:53.780]
And you click that thing and you're powerful

[01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:57.500]
Oh yeah, especially like the other night when Eric got refused to change it

[01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:59.180]
Do we ever find out what that was all about?

[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:01.800]
It's sick, like me

[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:04.280]
No, he's been sick all week

[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:06.220]
Oh, week, he's been sick all week

[01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:08.620]
Every time I turn around you tell me Eric is sick

[01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:09.200]
What's the hell we go?

[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:10.300]
We can't afford to lose him

[01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:12.400]
God, if we lose Eric, what do you guys think?

[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:12.960]
Whoa

[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:15.680]
Then we have to fall back on Josh for our computer stuff

[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:16.920]
He didn't know his answer from his elbow

[01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:19.040]
That's my opinion, I'm like Disney

[01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:21.260]
Anyway, it's just a joke, just relax Josh

[01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:23.400]
We know that you're really a stuute

[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:24.060]
Thank you

[01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:25.360]
I'm voting for Mad Dog

[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:27.160]
Mad Dog needs to be on a two o'clock

[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:29.720]
Oh, I would have voted for Ernie Sochino, but it's too late now

[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:31.060]
Too late to turn back now

[01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:33.200]
In fact, we got some votes on there already

[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.500]
I just changed it, and this audience is in a frenzy

[01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:37.980]
Man, it's two letting Martez won the big O-1

[01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:39.060]
The first four votes

[01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:40.620]
The big rock solid

[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:40.980]
Oh!

[01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:43.500]
Well, he was sure kissing my ass this morning

[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:45.300]
Have you do the effort he took that stupid call?

[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:49.460]
After, I wouldn't be surprised if Greeper probably called up the guy with the eyes at home

[01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:50.320]
He's probably got his number

[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:52.280]
Because it seems like Greeper would be part of that group

[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:53.860]
Oh, no, I take that back

[01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:55.600]
Because those people actually are groupies of mine

[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:57.640]
As opposed to Greeper or hates me in this show

[01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:59.900]
Anybody in the left of a till of the hundredth grade poison

[01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:00.220]
Yeah

[01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:02.680]
But he's still probably called him up at home and set it up

[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:04.720]
Turn him loose on the big O

[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:05.780]
All this crap

[01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:09.320]
All Robert Greeper, and you know what I love about the sports shows at the end of the show

[01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:10.620]
And they all do it

[01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:11.720]
I don't know if Hank does it

[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:14.280]
Not in things that we didn't have time to do it because he's doing a crossover with me

[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:15.480]
We're doing our cross-dress routine

[01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:18.720]
But they all have to thank who's behind the glass

[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:19.760]
Who cares?

[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:21.600]
The audience doesn't care who's sitting back there

[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:23.160]
Like I got to like go in the hall

[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:24.840]
Josh Cordis is after controls

[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:27.400]
And George Rodriguez is in the room there sitting there up

[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:28.280]
To smoke at a fat one

[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:29.440]
Who cares, you know?

[01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:31.840]
This station does so many stupid things, man

[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:34.080]
Let me give me a charge in there for about a week

[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:34.760]
That's all I want

[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:36.960]
Just put me in charge for a week I'll actually come back down there

[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:38.720]
Man, you'll see some heads roll around

[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:39.840]
Looks like a bowling alley

[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:42.900]
You'll see some heads roll out that door like crazy

[01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:44.980]
Just a head part like in Saudi Arabia

[01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:46.300]
God, would you love that?

[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:47.660]
Oh, don't get me started

[01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:48.260]
Don't get me started

[01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:49.800]
I would clean that place out

[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:52.760]
And Robert Greeper, he'd be one of the first ones out that door

[01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:53.740]
Him and his head

[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:55.800]
Yeah

[01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:57.900]
Come on up there all stand tuned for the release

[01:09:57.900 --> 01:09:58.560]
Yeah, I do

[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:01.180]
Oh, I found it too late

[01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:02.600]
Just give me the old row of flush

[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:05.600]
Okay, here's the final total on the Yachati Kurek thing

[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:08.220]
She makes me gag this whole thing, you know?

[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:10.260]
This is the ultimate

[01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:11.460]
This is where they've come out

[01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:14.720]
I don't understand why they don't have what's your name from entertainment tonight or inside addition

[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:15.220]
What's your name?

[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:17.380]
She was on yesterday punctuating about

[01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:18.640]
Like, Lisa

[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:20.300]
Lisa given this

[01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:21.460]
One of those, you know

[01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:22.240]
Very heart-man

[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:25.180]
I rather have Mary Hartman doing the news

[01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:26.620]
At least she'd put a few yucks in it

[01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:28.420]
And Pat O'Brien, at least he's good for some laughs

[01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:29.480]
Yeah, right

[01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:32.440]
He could be like drinking right on the air there

[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:33.900]
Be less of that on WKRP

[01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:36.520]
Have another belt pat, actin', have another pop

[01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:38.980]
When you watch Kady Kurek on CBSAV News

[01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:41.000]
Final total of 139 votes

[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.240]
And we cut this baby off at 1125

[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:44.080]
Aren't you excited?

[01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:45.660]
Don't watch Network News

[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:48.600]
359, 31.5% of this is stoop crowd

[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:50.260]
Even though the show has been very newsy

[01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:51.740]
Too newsy if you asked me

[01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:52.900]
Like I think I would my paycheck

[01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:54.160]
He's no see, we're newsy

[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:56.240]
Too nosy, mind your own business, okay?

[01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:58.160]
Kady Kurek blows 289

[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:00.480]
Don't watch CBS now, won't watch her either

[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:04.060]
257, 2 Okie-Doki, Okie-Fonoki

[01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:05.220]
I almost said something else

[01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:06.680]
Watch other shows now

[01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:09.980]
We'll watch her, those 78 are gonna give her a trial

[01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:10.800]
A trial balloon

[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:13.300]
Watch CBS now, we'll watch her, 71

[01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:15.040]
I hate this poll, 69

[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:18.200]
Watch CBS now, but won't watch that bitch, 16

[01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:20.820]
Kady Kurek, final, final tally

[01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:21.820]
Write that down

[01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:23.200]
Gonna be a big quiz on Monday

[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:25.400]
Dude, this is scary, it's gonna be asking all the questions

[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:27.240]
I'm kind of scared just thinking about it

[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:27.940]
Not a joke

[01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:32.540]
By the way, this new deal now is dated around 300 or 400 AD

[01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:34.100]
300 or 400 AD

[01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:36.660]
A hundred years span there

[01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:40.640]
Yeah, and of course this is long after Jesus and Paul and Saul

[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:42.400]
And all of those other goons were long gone

[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:44.800]
But nevertheless, not to mention Judas himself

[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:46.460]
You think there wasn't Judas's scary?

[01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:47.080]
No

[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:49.660]
I like Julius Caesar, we know there was one of those

[01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:50.120]
That's right

[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:51.920]
How about Orange Julius?

[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:53.680]
Oh yeah, I've had one in my hands

[01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:55.080]
Man, I haven't had one of those

[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:57.500]
There's a big orange Julius stand in the Eden Center, huh?

[01:11:57.660 --> 01:11:58.540]
Dude, you're too young

[01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:01.920]
There's a big good orange Julius stand, I like the strawberry stuff

[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:04.060]
Or like what's his name says the Galilee Eyes?

[01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:05.320]
Maybe he likes the banana one

[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:08.300]
With lightning, quick speeds, the latest features and security

[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:11.180]
Comcast high speed internet leaves DSL in the dust

And today you can get on board for just 9.95 a month for two months

Comcast high speed internet is up to four times faster than DSL15

[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:22.640]
And up to 100 times faster than dialup

[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:26.040]
With your downloading music, watching streaming video, playing online games

[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:27.840]
Or maybe just surfing your favorite sites

[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:31.180]
Comcast reliable fast connection means you'll be flying through the internet

[01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:33.600]

You get instant access to free features like the fan

[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:38.560]
Video mail, Comcast raps the radio plus

And up to seven personal email accounts just to name a few

[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:45.020]

So you can be assured that your internet experience is always safe and secure

[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:48.960]

Sign up for Comcast high speed internet today for just 9.95 a month for two months

You wonder how you ever managed to get along without it

[01:12:57.420 --> 01:13:02.100]
Indeed call 305 Comcast or in 954 Comcast

[01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:09.420]
This is new running, what solid this is 5.62 AF

[01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:11.620]
God

[01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:21.420]
Who's the science of this that turned out to be a hypocrite?

[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:22.900]
Stop!

[01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:25.220]
You're dead now

[01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:29.780]
Who will be the dude that gets mad when they put down some food?

[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:31.020]
Stop!

[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:33.340]
Can you think it?

[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:37.480]
Who's the cat that's making fun of every other religion?

[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:39.160]
Stop!

[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:41.060]
Not at all

[01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:44.800]
This issue is one brainwash mother

[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:45.580]
Shit, John!

[01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:47.160]
I've heard of a chef

[01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:51.580]
He's a two-day blowhard

[01:13:51.580 --> 01:13:55.380]
But no one understands him but all unhovers

[01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:56.040]
Dance!

[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:12.080]
Excuse me but I do believe that's a act

[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:17.260]
One of the best parts about that episode is that they keep talking about the various assamine beliefs of the Scientologist

[01:14:17.260 --> 01:14:20.620]
And at the bottom of the screen they keep putting on their surprise

[01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:21.700]
That's what they really believe

[01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:26.140]
They really believe this crap

[01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:28.940]
48 votes on our new poll so far

[01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:32.780]
Who should get the permanent 24-hour slot at QAM?

[01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:33.480]
Two to four

[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:35.580]
We also have that I hate this poll

[01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:37.040]
And I won't listen anyway

[01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:38.440]
That'll boost those numbers

[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:39.020]
You'll see

[01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:41.100]
We'll boost them just zooming up there

[01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:41.720]
We got it?

[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:43.780]
I hate this poll and won't listen anyway

[01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:44.880]
Gym Manage 18

[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:46.440]
The Big O8

[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:47.580]
Bring back Mo7

[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:49.020]
Curtis 5

[01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:50.420]
Reverend Jones has got 3

[01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:51.560]
The Crow 2

[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:52.880]
Lany Martez has got a pair

[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:54.060]
Geldy's got a pair

[01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:55.140]
But you never know what that voice

[01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:56.260]
Joe's a ganky one

[01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:58.880]
And Ernie Soch and Kim Bo-camper so far I've got the big

[01:14:59.540 --> 01:14:59.980]
OOOH

[01:14:59.980 --> 01:14:59.980]

[01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:02.920]
Even though Ernie called in this morning to promote his career

[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:04.940]
Can we add some of the choices over there?

[01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:05.540]
Yeah, I like

[01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:06.140]
I don't care

[01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:09.240]
Well, wouldn't that be like I won't listen anyway?

[01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:11.300]
What would be the other reason you wouldn't care?

[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:12.940]
I mean, I don't care it's fine

[01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:13.780]
A lot of the time

[01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:15.320]
I don't talk that on there anyway

[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:17.580]
But we just put I won't listen anyway

[01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:18.760]
Oh, I missed it

[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:22.180]
Doesn't that is not synonymous with I don't care what would be the other reason you wouldn't care?

[01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:24.200]
If you were going to listen, do you understand?

[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:25.960]
Well, we have a vested interest

[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:27.760]
Go ahead, put it on there

[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:29.360]
Whatever I'm not going to do

[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:32.280]
I think we touched all the bases, okay?

[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:35.080]
Just like the Marlins will in New York against the Mets tonight

[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:38.380]
Wow, on AM560 maybe on QAA

[01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:41.660]
We got the Panther PENGWGAM on 1360 on the CAT

[01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:44.660]
Boy, it goes to show you what we think about those Panthers, man

[01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:45.580]
Of course they're done anyway

[01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:46.780]
Stick a fork in them

[01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:48.480]
Come to QAAM, hello

[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:49.840]
Neil

[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:50.700]
Yes, sir

[01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:51.660]
Good morning, sir

[01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:52.260]
Where is Neil?

[01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:54.280]
That's his phone from Fallout 8

[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:54.840]
Hey, Tony

[01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:58.420]
I was first of all, I moved down here from Chicago

[01:15:58.420 --> 01:15:59.300]
I was down

[01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:00.600]
I moved, Tony, bad move

[01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:03.460]
I was in public, you know, good old public, right?

[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:04.860]
Yeah, good old public

[01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:07.180]
Well, you're not going to like it after this

[01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:07.900]
I have a senior friend

[01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:09.060]
I will like it, a lot

[01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:11.900]
567, go back to Chicago, we'll go to Piggly Wiggly, okay?

[01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:13.840]
Go somewhere else, we like publics a lot on this show

[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:18.240]
567-0560, pound 560 on the Verizon and Singular Wireless Lines

[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:19.680]
Another call from across the street

[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:21.180]
You think we're desperate, man?

[01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:22.440]
You got to see their log

[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:23.800]
They're burning it in the fireplace

[01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:25.640]
Somebody QAAM, hello

[01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:28.180]
That Josh is a Wask-going rabbit

[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:30.460]
Yeah, WQ-YM, hello

[01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:31.260]
Hey, how are you, Neil?

[01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:31.780]
Okay

[01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:34.040]
I got a couple for your poll, if you don't mind

[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:34.980]
Go right ahead

[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:36.820]
Is George's name on there?

[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:39.680]
George Rodriguez will be excellent choice, two to four, okay?

[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:41.640]
Okay, and how about the stud?

[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:42.480]
How about him?

[01:16:42.740 --> 01:16:43.240]
He'll be our...

[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:45.640]
That's cool, man, let's get him on here, I have no problem with that

[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:47.420]
And by the way, thank you for the...

[01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:49.300]
You have a board show, that's all I'm always in to put him on

[01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:49.840]
I beg your pardon?

[01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:53.200]
By the way, thank you for the pasta, public hazard

[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:55.900]
And also they've had it on sale for a while, it's very good

[01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:58.860]
Good, excellent, okay, go grab a whole bunch, hop it up

[01:16:58.860 --> 01:17:00.920]
Get a chest in time for Paisach and Easter

[01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:02.860]
And don't buy that Easter candy, man

[01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:04.700]
Wait till after Easter, because then they...

[01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:07.760]
All the... especially the drugstores, Walgreens, CVS

[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:10.580]
After Easter, they cut the price down, they practically give it away

[01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:12.980]
Because they've got... so they're just tons and tons of Easter candy

[01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:14.720]
All those marshmallow eggs, you know?

[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:16.300]
You know what I'm talking about?

[01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:16.880]
Right

[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:19.500]
Walgreens are famous for that, after that...

[01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:23.080]
As soon as Easter is over, man, and they just cut that down like for a dime

[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:25.980]
You can get enough candy like kill yourself with, and it's suicides

[01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:26.920]
Especially the peeps

[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:28.960]
I don't like the chocolate peeps

[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:31.000]
No, the marshmallow cover with the yellow sugar

[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.240]
Yeah, I know, they're called peeps, I know

[01:17:32.620 --> 01:17:34.600]
I've had a pee, oh yeah, I know what you're talking about

[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:36.720]
Yeah, I haven't had those in a long time, bastard

[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:37.280]
Cotty

[01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:39.060]
I'd rather have my Murray James, though

[01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:41.680]
I'd rather say a way that plays for some still candy

[01:17:42.580 --> 01:17:44.820]
Yeah, see they got... see it says right on the website

[01:17:44.820 --> 01:17:46.600]
They got candies from the 50s and 60s

[01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:49.000]
That doesn't mean when they were popular, it means when they were manufactured

[01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:52.660]
So they were a little stale, according to our friend Sean with a poll

[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:55.360]
76 votes on there, man, it's 21

[01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:57.500]
Who should get the permanent 2-4 slot on Cume

[01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:00.580]
If these people ever get off their ass, if they ever get off the dime

[01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:03.700]
Good God, it's time to get off the dime

[01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:07.040]
Bring back Moe has got it doesn't look at that, bring back Moe

[01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:10.160]
Don't know what you got, tell you lose it, that's what Ralph Donner said

[01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:12.900]
The big O has got 10, Curtis 10

[01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:14.540]
Reverend Jones has got 6

[01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:17.260]
I won't listen anyway for, Geltie's got 4

[01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:19.460]
See he's not doing all that great and we've got him on almost every day

[01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:21.440]
Because he and the clearance are doing something

[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:24.880]
The Crow has got 3, Lenny Martens has got a pair of Kimba Volkamp

[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:25.700]
We'll finally get 2

[01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:29.560]
George has got 1, Joseph Gackie's got 1, you're Tawai Joseph Gackie

[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:30.940]
Hey, we can do a show together

[01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:32.500]
Isn't that a feather in your cap?

[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:33.540]
I read it down

[01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:36.520]
And let's see, Suds Pullman got 1

[01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:40.860]
I hate this poll and there's any socion of both got the big 1 and the first 82 votes

[01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:42.060]
Curtis is just a little snapshot

[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:44.020]
That's a little snapshot, you understand

[01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:46.920]
Speaking of snapshots, the latest poll is looking really bad

[01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:49.440]
For the leaker in chief

[01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:53.300]
President Bush is approval ratings hit a series of new lows in an AP if so

[01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:57.260]
It's poll that also shows Republicans are renting their advantage on national security

[01:18:57.260 --> 01:19:00.080]
Green election you're news for party struggling to stay in part

[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:03.240]
You're struggling, you're struggling, where's the struggling lady where we need her

[01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:04.300]
Remember the struggling lady?

[01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:05.920]
Oh yeah, struggling

[01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:10.520]
Democratic leaders predicted that they'll seize control or want or vote chambers of Congress in November

[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:12.380]
Republicans said they feared the worst

[01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:15.540]
Unless they political landscape quickly changes

[01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:17.720]
Like maybe another terrorist attack would be good for them

[01:19:18.580 --> 01:19:20.440]
Remember how the first one was for them politically?

[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:22.160]
You ain't saying nothing yet

[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:27.300]
Just 36% of the public approves of Bush's job performance is lowest ever rating in AP if so is pulling

[01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:29.800]
I think it's time for another emergency meeting of the car law group

[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:33.820]
The Bush and Bin Laden's better get together again real fast if they want to hang on to power

[01:19:33.820 --> 01:19:39.940]
By contrast, the president's job of approval rating was 47% among likely voters just before election day 2004

[01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:46.180]
And I'm whopping 64% of my registered voters in October 2002 and I was down to 36% in this poll

[01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:51.200]
If that is Bush's numbers maybe Congress is our worst just 30%

[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:52.320]
About 30, man!

[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:56.600]
Of the public approves of the GOP led Congress job performance and Republicans seem to be shouldersing the blame

[01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:58.260]
These numbers are scary

[01:19:58.260 --> 01:20:02.600]
We've lost every advantage we ever had, GOP pollster Tony Fabrizio said

[01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:04.280]
Fabrizio, prepare the machina

[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:08.560]
The good news is Democrats don't have much of a plan, the bad news is they may not need one

[01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:26.960]
I'm saying like Santina said, I wonder how you come up with those things so fast other than you

[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:27.380]
Like that

[01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:29.140]
The things you put your brains all over your nice side for

[01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:30.580]
Or then the full one

[01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:31.220]
What are you going to do?

[01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:32.340]
Nice college, boy

[01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:34.680]
They want to get mixed up in a family business

[01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:37.900]
Now you want to go down a police station, because it's like you're in a face a little bit

[01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:40.520]
What do you think is the army where you shoot them a mile away?

[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:41.900]
You got to get a post like this

[01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:44.380]
The big your blood that brains all over your nice side will leave soon

[01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:45.440]
Come in!

[01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:47.060]
You're taking us very close

[01:20:49.580 --> 01:20:51.420]
You know why we love that movie so much?

[01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:52.820]
Because most other ones suck, yeah?

[01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:57.120]
Because it's so great and most everything else pales in a win significance of period to it

[01:20:57.680 --> 01:20:59.140]
Look at this, Jesus and Judas

[01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:00.560]
I actually say about Judas

[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:03.480]
Oh every time I see her on her I say Jesus Christ, are you on again?

[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:05.760]
That misses Limbaugh, I know she's your favorite

[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:08.160]

At the Honey Junior

[01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:15.520]
We're at the way to go, Kristin, Kristin

That's what I'm going to shoot

[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:42.860]
High fudge, high fudge, high fudge, we're at the speed

[01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:44.880]
I think I just figured out the sort of Judas thing

[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:46.160]
Leave it to me

[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:52.160]
In his grand jury test in the morning, we're really called President Bush, a Judas

[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.580]
You see? That means there's a good guy

[01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:56.900]
So now, of course, we have to turn all the history around

[01:24:56.900 --> 01:24:59.800]
And we just, and just after we said that we discovered these tablets, man

[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:02.720]
And we said, take two and call us in the morning with another fairy tale

[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:03.980]
With some more bubble miceys

[01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:06.980]
And so now, Judas, who used to be the bad guy, now he's a good guy

[01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:10.740]
Kathy Lee, Gifford, on Larry King, oh my god, I'll be sure to avoid that

[01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:14.160]
Like the plague, like my TV's got very bubonic, very, very

[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:19.440]
At least two, and I, the story changed, by the way, this is a bad news from Iraq, we got worse news

[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:20.300]
Oh no

[01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:21.180]
No, yeah

[01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:26.980]
At least two suicide attackers wearing women's cloaks, blew themselves up today in a Shi'ai Mosque in northern Baghdad

[01:25:26.980 --> 01:25:31.040]
Killing at least 52, was 43 before it announced up to 52, at least 52

[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:32.860]
And they're still trying to put body parts together

[01:25:32.860 --> 01:25:34.680]
And they're wounding more than 160

[01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:37.400]
Second major attack against Shi'ai targets in as many days

[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:40.060]
CBS News correspondent Kimberly Dozier be saying

[01:25:40.060 --> 01:25:45.360]
The violence came as US ambassador, Zalme Khalilah, whatever his name is,

[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:48.180]
Warded that Iraq faces the possibility of sectarian civil war

[01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:50.820]
If efforts to build a national unity government do not succeed

[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:52.680]
Isn't that great?

[01:25:54.220 --> 01:25:57.240]
We don't need George Vorson, we need to be able to link him for the civil war, right?

[01:25:57.780 --> 01:25:59.060]
Honest Abe, honestly

[01:25:59.940 --> 01:26:03.540]
567, we're taking a million calls today, man, and having a hell of a good time doing it

[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:06.060]
Let's take a look at that poll, this is a movie in Portante poll

[01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:08.820]
Because maybe we got a shot of picking somebody out, okay?

[01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:13.280]
Because they sure don't, 124 votes, who should get the permanent 2-4 slot on QAM?

[01:26:13.660 --> 01:26:17.500]
Jim Manditch, 29, bring back Moe, 16, that is shocking

[01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:18.300]
Don't talk, don't talk

[01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:20.580]
I didn't realize he had that many relatives in town

[01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:25.300]
Sats coolman's got a dozen, boy, he's zooming toward the top, he's side with Curtis, they both got a dozen

[01:26:25.300 --> 01:26:28.960]
We all love Sats, what are you eating now? Don't tell me lunch from how he's got there?

[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:29.360]
That's right

[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:30.920]
You're not eating a chili, are you?

[01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:31.660]
You know it

[01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:34.820]
Oh, please tell me you're not eating no chili, oh I'm eating some chili

[01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:39.220]
So maybe guys should get some practice for next week when you're on vacation because I can see you won't be coming back anytime soon

[01:26:39.220 --> 01:26:40.720]
Well I mean a chili too

[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:44.280]
No, well just like I said, I want to be alone

[01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:47.360]
And I think I'll get my wish

[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:50.640]
Going to be a little crowded with the two of you both in their fightin' for that one stall

[01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:54.060]
Maybe you can find the twin hole around the backyard

[01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:56.140]
Yeah, I can use the other one

[01:26:56.140 --> 01:26:57.040]
The other guy's got a twin hole

[01:26:57.040 --> 01:26:59.000]
Josh can use the tall stall, he's a tall boy

[01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:03.620]
I use that stall, I like that one so I had to cover that guard

[01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:04.620]
It's comfortable man

[01:27:04.620 --> 01:27:07.260]
The bars are good especially if you have any growth in the room

[01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:10.320]
Who should get the permanent 2-4 slot on QAM?

[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:13.460]
Man, I wouldn't let me have all see interrupted me here

[01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:17.480]
Man, it's 29, sud 16, bring back most 16, Curtis 13

[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:19.800]
I won't listen anyway 11, the big ole 11

[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:22.120]
Who is kissing around heavy duty this morning

[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:23.600]
Reverend Jones has got 10

[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:26.940]
George has got 6, well you're moving into Reverend Jones territory now

[01:27:26.940 --> 01:27:27.540]
Oh gee

[01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:29.500]
The Crow 5, Gildy 5

[01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:32.420]
See, wait, this is right there, I lay it right there for you

[01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:36.000]
Gildy, who's on again today and I'm all freaking week long

[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.180]
And of course with a season ending very very soon for the Panthers

[01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:41.680]
I mean he's gonna be available a lot in the summertime

[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:44.540]
Oh my god, thank god I won't be around that much

[01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:46.940]
Oh geez, Gildy's got 5

[01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:50.420]
Vote camper 3, Joseph Gackie 2, Lenny Martez 2, Ernie Sochen 1

[01:27:50.420 --> 01:27:52.740]
I hate this poll, don't have any, see they like this one

[01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:56.560]
This is the kind of craft that they would like to sink their teeth into

[01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:58.660]
Although it finally got a vote, long with Ernie Sochen

[01:27:58.660 --> 01:27:59.840]
They want a few left out

[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:02.680]
This, this is the kind of garbage they want to sink their teeth into

[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:04.940]
Makes them feel like they got something to say about some

[01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:08.200]
You know, which they don't need it a week but nevertheless

[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:11.360]
Oh, I do have one story, can I do this one?

[01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:12.240]
Do it

[01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:16.400]
After the 2004 presidential election, Kaihoga County election workers in Ohio

[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:20.100]
was secretly scurried rules designed to make sure that all votes were counted correctly

[01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:21.900]
A special prosecutor's charging now

[01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:23.980]
While there was no evidence of vote for out yet

[01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:28.740]
The prosecutor said their efforts were aimed at avoiding inexpensive and very public hand-recount of all votes cast

[01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:31.380]
Three top county elections officials have been indicted

[01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:35.300]
And Ernie County, that's the Ohio Ernie County prosecutor Kevin Baxter

[01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:38.480]
Kevin Baxter, who wrote that article says more indictments are possible

[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:45.280]
Michael Vu, executive director of the Kaihoga County elections board, said workers followed procedures that have been in place for 23 years

[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:48.500]
He said board employees had no objection to doing an exhaustive hand count if needed

[01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:50.440]
Meaning they had no motive to break the law

[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:54.080]
Internet bloggers have cried foul since 2004 about election results in Ohio

[01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:56.040]
One of the key states that decided the election

[01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:59.640]
They've been tracking Baxter's investigation with online post about the indictments

[01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:03.560]
Baxter's prosecution said as I know Ohio's safeguards for ensuring that every vote is counted

[01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:07.920]
Baxter charges that Kaihoga election worker is mindful of the month long Florida recount in 2000

[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:12.680]
Not only ignored the safeguards but worked to defeat them during Ohio's 2004 recount

[01:29:13.380 --> 01:29:16.800]
Candidates for president from the Green and Libertarian parties requested the Ohio recount

[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:19.040]
Obviously not the Democrats because there are a bunch of whooses

[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:21.760]
State laws and regulations specify how a recount works

[01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:28.920]
Election workers in each county are supposed to count 3% of the ballots by handed by machine randomly choosing precincts for that count

[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:33.620]
If the hand in machine counts match the other 97% of votes are recounted by machine

[01:29:33.620 --> 01:29:35.960]
If the numbers don't match workers repeat the effort

[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:42.980]
If they still don't match exactly the workers must complete the recount by hand a tedious process that could take police and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars

[01:29:42.980 --> 01:29:46.560]
But the fix was in it the Kaihoga election board Baxter says

[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:47.700]
The fix was in

[01:29:48.660 --> 01:29:49.620]
Got it?

[01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:55.900]
They may not be real good at governing but they sure are good at two things stealing elections and smearing and smearing

[01:29:55.900 --> 01:29:57.340]
It's the Carl Roe vFn way

[01:29:57.720 --> 01:29:59.160]
Well I'll tell you one thing by Monday

[01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:02.180]
Oh that's where you'll be on vacation anyway but you'll be looking at this over the weekend

[01:30:02.180 --> 01:30:03.100]
Who me?

[01:30:03.460 --> 01:30:05.940]
Yeah you'll be checking this pull out it'll be an ego unlikely

[01:30:06.620 --> 01:30:09.480]
Yeah you will look at that you're all you're almost up to I will listen anyway

[01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:11.420]
Other times you put me on there I've never voted for myself

[01:30:11.420 --> 01:30:14.180]
You've almost I didn't vote for you that's because you weren't on there yet

[01:30:14.180 --> 01:30:17.220]
Plus you're not doing how now can you do to to for anyway

[01:30:17.220 --> 01:30:18.620]
What kind of crap is that?

[01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:22.520]
The kid it's moot and they're not going to hire suds and they're not going to put on a non sports show this is all moot

[01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:24.180]
This is just a you know my story

[01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:27.180]
It's an exercise right it's an exercise in fruitility

[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:30.200]
WQ I am pull line hello

[01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:31.020]

Yeah exactly Gators my ass

[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:45.920]
Watch out Yahoo's

[01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:46.720]
Was he on the team?

[01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:48.640]
Did he have someone here with that on the team?

[01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:52.460]
He probably don't even go there either he probably never went there he probably never been in games who in his life

[01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:55.740]
Oh he's just another front running punk is what he is okay with no light

[01:30:55.740 --> 01:30:58.220]

[01:30:58.220 --> 01:30:59.060]
I have no light yeah

[01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:00.640]
He was trying to say that he was screaming it

[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:01.240]
I have no light

[01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:03.080]
He had a lot to do with the pal maybe he was just screaming

[01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:03.300]
Hey

[01:31:04.060 --> 01:31:05.020]
WQ I am hello

[01:31:05.020 --> 01:31:06.260]
Hey Neil how you doing?

[01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:06.880]
Pretty good

[01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:10.640]
Just sitting here to gas station filling up my car and I like to thank President Bush

[01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:12.520]
That was $3.99 to Gallon

[01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:13.120]
All right

[01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:14.260]
It's going up

[01:31:14.260 --> 01:31:16.500]
On this summer man you ain't seeing nothing yet

[01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:17.940]
Oh great thanks a lot

[01:31:17.940 --> 01:31:20.280]
You're gonna give a second mortgage man you'll lead it

[01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:21.400]
All right you have a big day

[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:21.740]
Bye bye

[01:31:21.740 --> 01:31:22.800]
I do like that

[01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:24.420]
Yeah thanks for him for rinding us

[01:31:24.420 --> 01:31:26.900]
Thank you Mr. President for those low gas prices

[01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:29.200]
You and your rag head friends over there in Saudi Arabia

[01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:33.340]
Let me say it again you know you believe whatever you want all united people out there

[01:31:33.340 --> 01:31:35.560]
The Bushes and the Saudis man

[01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:38.420]
They are as there is tight as a snare drum

[01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:40.360]
There is tight as the cheeks of a witch's

[01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:41.680]
That's how tight they are

[01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:46.620]
So you can you know you can confabulate all you want all kinds of cockam maybe ideas in your head

[01:31:46.620 --> 01:31:49.640]
The fact of the matter is that the world is being raped at it okay

[01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:52.840]
But and he can come on there talking about alternative sources of energy

[01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:56.420]
And do that smoking chip routine in his the fact of the matter is man

[01:31:56.420 --> 01:32:00.080]
The gang rape is a real laugh to these people because that's what's going on

[01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:04.120]
And of course then we just have on there the other day about the record profits these people are making

[01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:06.040]
But their deposits still are good enough man

[01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:07.020]
Not good enough

[01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:11.540]
You're never going to satisfy exon and mobile and unicale all these other people

[01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:15.200]
And of course when it comes to unicale I wonder how homicarsize doing over in Afghanistan

[01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:20.140]
You know homicarsize who of a mousher of says hasn't got a clue what's going on in his own country

[01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:23.680]
That's what your buddy Mousher of said last week

[01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:27.020]
He said homicarsize don't have no idea what's going on in Afghanistan

[01:32:27.560 --> 01:32:28.260]
That's what he said

[01:32:28.260 --> 01:32:31.780]
See if they would stop beating so much deli there if they would sub-trend imitate the Jews

[01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:34.000]
They may hate the Jews but they keep eating all that deli

[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.900]
That's why they're like that all the time

[01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:39.800]
In fact his network carsize say he said the food in Afghanistan is haloscious

[01:32:40.260 --> 01:32:43.180]
Which ought to be in your lexicon by now I give you that to begin to show this more

[01:32:43.180 --> 01:32:44.960]
In top of the show we give you haloscious

[01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:47.400]
The opposite of deli is haloscious

[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:50.880]
And if you have a mewats you don't like you might want to say it correctly in Russian

[01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:52.200]
Spault near haloscious

[01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:53.020]
Got it?

[01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:53.680]
Got it

[01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:57.720]
All right, I hope you take your oats on this because old chicken and he sure does some damn good dish

[01:32:57.720 --> 01:32:59.800]
Because it's very embarrassing the bad stuff too

[01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:02.060]
I don't want to correct them on it because it's funny when it's delicious

[01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:03.340]
It does say they would say that it's bad

[01:33:03.340 --> 01:33:03.480]
Right

[01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:05.020]
Kind of like butchered ferritail

[01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:07.680]
Let's talk about the Rocky and Bullwinkle what are you saying?

[01:33:07.820 --> 01:33:08.560]
Now now we're talking

[01:33:09.180 --> 01:33:14.020]
I mean South Park is great and the daily show is wonderful because it's scripted and he's not funny at all

[01:33:14.020 --> 01:33:15.900]
But the show is scripted and he reads it well

[01:33:16.340 --> 01:33:19.260]
But I think now is the time for fractured ferritails coming back to it

[01:33:19.260 --> 01:33:21.580]
Let's dig up the Hans Connryne and whatever it holds on

[01:33:21.580 --> 01:33:22.080]
Hans Connryne

[01:33:22.460 --> 01:33:24.480]
He's taking a lot of ginger speaking for it

[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:25.040]

[01:33:25.660 --> 01:33:26.000]
What?

[01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:26.900]
Ah!

[01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:28.300]
Oh!

[01:33:28.580 --> 01:33:28.680]
Oh!

[01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:29.020]

[01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:33.220]
It's supposed to be the Bullwinkle show tape

[01:33:33.220 --> 01:33:35.260]
Got the wrong script from the telephopsy

[01:33:35.260 --> 01:33:37.160]
I think you know it's not the same

[01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:38.420]
He's a hunky binky report

[01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:41.140]
No, no, the Bullwinkle show

[01:33:41.900 --> 01:33:45.140]
And I am your booster of ceremonies for the next half hour

[01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:46.960]
Bullwinkle, he's still

[01:33:48.140 --> 01:33:49.300]
I've never heard this before

[01:33:49.300 --> 01:33:55.040]
I mean, whatever show has the host who sings dances, recites poetry

[01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:56.520]
And has athletes

[01:33:57.240 --> 01:33:59.040]
on this network anyway

[01:33:59.620 --> 01:34:03.800]
I suppose you're wondering why I called you all here this evening

[01:34:04.940 --> 01:34:09.500]
Well, this is why it's the Bullwinkle show

[01:34:12.180 --> 01:34:12.660]
Wow

[01:34:12.660 --> 01:34:15.300]
Yeah, that was worth the price of admission

[01:34:16.180 --> 01:34:17.520]
Okay, that's it

[01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:19.740]
One of my all-time favorites

[01:34:19.740 --> 01:34:24.840]
I think maybe over the weekend I'm going to watch all those bullwinkle DVDs that chicken X and me

[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:25.460]
I would

[01:34:25.460 --> 01:34:26.520]
They're great

[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:27.920]
I'm going to chuckle on my face

[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:31.220]
Get ready for a long week next week with no George Manelbee, just me and Josh

[01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:35.060]
Josh is going to, he's going to unload all next week when he really thinks about this place

[01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:51.720]
This is New Roger! Oh, oh, this is 5.62 am

[01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:57.800]
This is Mark Morgan is the 12-1 hour on QAM

[01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:10.140]
George Forsky saying, don't even prove they knew as part of the troll

[01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:15.500]
But such a distinct show, 10 million folks knocking from Mexico

[01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:27.440]
They're hiding in the trees when they're caught the feds just as they're free

[01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:33.460]
They get paid, got these, the 30 cents from all your neighbors' lawn

[01:36:35.220 --> 01:36:44.180]
Your name is a grown, your neighbor, our borders have more holes than a cloud of graces

[01:36:44.180 --> 01:36:49.960]
Looks like we'll be cooking up more hot tomahe

[01:36:49.960 --> 01:37:00.380]
Sometimes I wish I had a fence around me, but I need a maze from my home

[01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:06.220]
When I get used to getting another body advantage and my 74-744 did the number keeps rising and rising

[01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:07.840]
Other than that, oh, we're fine!

[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:09.640]
They're going hunky-dory over there in Iraq

[01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:11.500]
What do they do? Like a digs-all puzzle thing?

[01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:17.220]
Speaking of the immigration thing in that bit we just played, which is an old one that they resurrected because they never straighten out the immigration problem

[01:37:17.220 --> 01:37:18.420]
So that bit is always good

[01:37:18.420 --> 01:37:27.220]
The Senate side tracks we'd be immigration legislation today, leaving in doubt prospects for passing a bill offering the hope of citizenship to millions of men, women and children living in the US illegally

[01:37:27.900 --> 01:37:34.800]
Illegally, law-breakers, people who came in illegally, not people who waited online like real immigrants, but illegal arrests breaking the law

[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:38.580]
A carefully crafted compromise that supporters had claimed could win an overwhelming majority

[01:37:38.580 --> 01:37:39.960]
Remember how breathless they were yesterday?

[01:37:40.260 --> 01:37:41.620]
Oh, they come up with a straight kayak

[01:37:42.220 --> 01:37:46.340]
Received only 38 of the 60 votes needed to protect it from weakening amendments by opponents

[01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:52.740]
Republicans were united in the 38 to 60 parliamentary vote, but Democrats who have insisted on no amendments, lost six votes from their members

[01:37:52.740 --> 01:37:55.960]
Six of their Democrats lost their members, and you can tell that

[01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:57.700]
What if Hillary lost her member yet?

[01:37:58.180 --> 01:38:01.680]
You know, they keep talking like she's a sure thing and, oh, I know

[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:06.260]
The new party, the new party, they bought off, did the decoy party, did they play it?

[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:07.620]
Talk about a death wish

[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:10.900]
That's what the D stands for a Democratic party, death wish

[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:11.880]
God

[01:38:12.700 --> 01:38:16.080]
Anyway, let's move along, Kayddo, no need getting depressed, not much we can do about that

[01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:20.880]
Okay, a lot of problems out there, we're sure not going to solve them on some stupid as show on a sports talk radio show

[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:23.280]
I mean, sports talk radio station, excuse me

[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:27.120]
I bet you we got almost 200 votes on the new pool, what time we put this up, 1125?

[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:28.320]
If I'm not mistaken?

[01:38:29.140 --> 01:38:29.480]
1.99?

[01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:30.780]
1.99?

[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:31.940]
Aren't you excited?

[01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:36.000]
And you have passed, you're making a move, mister, you're in the third place

[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.600]
Oh, I'm having for the big time now

[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:38.580]
You're tied with mo!

[01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:42.720]
I think there's something symbolic to be said about it

[01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:44.520]
I would have done a show with him if no one else would have

[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:45.960]
Nobody else would have

[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:47.000]
It would have been a pit

[01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:48.340]
You would have been good all right

[01:38:48.340 --> 01:38:50.460]
You would have been the champion in the shins under the table, I'm sure

[01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:51.660]
That's a slot fight before

[01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:54.120]
And Yanke is a piece, Yanke that muskrat

[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:58.540]
How about you if I, now, see, count your votes ahead of time

[01:38:58.540 --> 01:39:00.340]
Like, die bowl of man, just like Bush and Ohio

[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:02.460]
200, right on the money man

[01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:05.780]
Ernie Sochens got one for two to four Lane Martes, three, Jersey Gaki, three

[01:39:05.780 --> 01:39:08.280]
I hate this poll for the crow's got six, the crow

[01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:10.440]
When's the crow on today, is Yanke today? No

[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:13.740]
I'll come on to me, we'd rather have mad dog and Curtis on than the crow

[01:39:13.740 --> 01:39:14.760]
What's wrong with us?

[01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:17.480]
Bo Campers 7, Gildi 8, Reverend Jones 11

[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:19.540]
Even Reverend Jones has got more than Gildi

[01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:22.520]
We got Gildi on every day, you whizzling clearance, you idiot

[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:24.040]
Let's see, what does that tell you?

[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:25.080]
Listen to me

[01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:29.380]
These people don't get who did mo for amusement on this station

[01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:30.920]
Reverend Jones or Gildi, okay?

[01:39:31.420 --> 01:39:34.240]
Ernie, is there any, I mean, you know, we put that Gildi on

[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:36.660]
They get like 90 shares, this is a mafia

[01:39:36.660 --> 01:39:37.360]
All right?

[01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:38.440]
Remember when I talked about that?

[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:41.600]
About how they could put Bo Campers on doing the mo in Gildi show

[01:39:42.180 --> 01:39:45.300]
Gildi 8, Reverend Jones 11, the big old 15, Curtis 17

[01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:47.480]
They don't want Gildi enough with Gildi already, okay?

[01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:50.060]
Enough of this squeaking, I won't listen anyway, teen

[01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:53.920]
Bring back mo 19, George Rodriguez 19, you've moved from nowhere

[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:56.180]
From Oblivion into a tie with a mo in my eye

[01:39:56.180 --> 01:39:57.960]
I got 20 so though, you must have not reached that

[01:39:57.960 --> 01:39:59.740]
Oh yeah, well let me refresh it

[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:02.260]
No, I still got, let's see

[01:40:02.260 --> 01:40:03.700]
No, you got 23 now?

[01:40:03.700 --> 01:40:04.180]
Oh geez

[01:40:04.700 --> 01:40:06.620]
You've moved ahead of bring back mo and I won't listen anyway

[01:40:06.620 --> 01:40:09.720]
George 23, mad dog 35 and suds has got 36

[01:40:10.100 --> 01:40:12.440]
suds away and they won't hire him anyway because he doesn't do a sports show

[01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:14.080]
That's right, plus he doesn't work alone anyway

[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:14.960]
That's right

[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:17.220]
I mean, I love suds but the idea of him being out from two to four

[01:40:17.220 --> 01:40:18.860]
It's just ludicrous, you know what I'm saying?

[01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:19.800]
Okay

[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:25.000]
I'm just telling you, I'd rather go ahead and suds farth and most people talk

[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:25.680]
Really?

[01:40:25.940 --> 01:40:26.100]
Yeah

[01:40:26.100 --> 01:40:27.540]
Oh, you've never heard him farth, have you?

[01:40:27.940 --> 01:40:28.920]
I don't want to hear him farth

[01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:30.000]
I don't want to hear him in the lobby

[01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:32.540]
I don't want to hear Joyce Farth, it's like a beatbox

[01:40:32.540 --> 01:40:34.800]
I want to hear the sounded Joyce's gurgle, the gurgle

[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:35.960]
I want to hear the sound of the rly breath

[01:40:36.460 --> 01:40:37.800]
That's what I want to hear, that's it

[01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:39.980]
I want to hear the last gurgle from her burgl

[01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:42.580]
The last, the death rattle from Joyce

[01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:44.700]
Oh man, I would have a party in my pants

[01:40:44.700 --> 01:40:47.140]
Oh, by the way, I forgot to mention this long ago today

[01:40:47.140 --> 01:40:48.300]
I apologize profusely

[01:40:48.300 --> 01:40:49.960]
Because I don't want to be too nosy but

[01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:52.980]
And nobody cares about this except inside radio people, you know?

[01:40:53.420 --> 01:40:53.780]
You know what I mean?

[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:54.300]
Absolutely

[01:40:55.160 --> 01:40:55.920]
Michael Crushham

[01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:58.220]
If you can't beat him, Crushham

[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:01.060]
Michael Crushham has been officially given managerial duties

[01:41:01.060 --> 01:41:03.180]
For all of Chief Channel's radio station in South Florida

[01:41:03.180 --> 01:41:04.040]
Queer Channel

[01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:07.660]
Crushham has been serving as interim RVP market manager for the stations

[01:41:07.660 --> 01:41:10.520]
Since the departure of 30 year veteran

[01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:14.540]
David Ross, a real a-hole if there ever was one

[01:41:14.540 --> 01:41:17.620]
Crushham was previously director sales for the company's Miami Cluster

[01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:22.040]
And there's new world reports to queer channel SVP Tom Sherwood

[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:25.940]
They got more titles, PVP and RVP and PVCP and PCB

[01:41:25.940 --> 01:41:29.300]
As RVP, sliced market manager for all South Florida

[01:41:29.300 --> 01:41:32.460]
Crushham will oversee queer channel's radio stations in Miami for Lauderdale Hollywood

[01:41:32.460 --> 01:41:36.060]
West Palm Beach, Boca for peer-stored rural beach and a Florida Keys market

[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:40.560]
Crushham is a 35 year broadcast veteran who sells salesman and positions

[01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:45.800]
At stations and number of markets are building Houston, Pittsburgh, Austin, Nashville, Louisville and Tulsa

[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:47.000]
And isn't it interesting?

[01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:50.640]
24 hours from Tulsa, Gene Pinty just died a couple days ago

[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:52.000]
You see the way these things were?

[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:54.820]
I think Michael Crushham

[01:41:55.500 --> 01:41:58.300]
Kind of mysterious, he didn't wake up the next day, 65 years old

[01:41:58.300 --> 01:42:00.540]
And the Pinty helped him in concerts, feeling pretty good?

[01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:02.960]
He doesn't wake up the next day because I saw Michael Crushham

[01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:05.520]
I'm going to testify, man, I'm going to be like Scooter Libby

[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:09.660]
I'm going to hop on my scooter and go to DC red and testify against Michael's Crushham

[01:42:10.020 --> 01:42:11.720]
A queer channel in Miami, you know?

[01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:14.000]
What a bunch of grave robbers, what a bunch of lunatics

[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.720]
Pete Rogers perfect for them, the assassinat

[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:21.720]
Let's put him on from 2 to 4 to tell some real real life stories of how many lives and careers he's destroyed

[01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:24.160]
Let's put him on, be captivating radio

[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:26.780]
I mean, that's a sport for him, it's a sport

[01:42:26.780 --> 01:42:29.220]
5, 6, 7, let's get these phones cranked again, man

[01:42:29.220 --> 01:42:30.260]
Otherwise, I'm going home

[01:42:30.260 --> 01:42:32.280]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60

[01:42:32.860 --> 01:42:35.280]
pound 5, 60, and you've arrived in a singular wireless line

[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:38.040]
And, oh look at this, last day of the campaign in Italy

[01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:40.820]
Is that where this thing is? I'm sure that, because, huh?

[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:41.980]
Yeah, the Italian election

[01:42:41.980 --> 01:42:44.240]
And Burlesconi's giving him that, what do you say?

[01:42:44.340 --> 01:42:46.120]
I can't say the word on the ear, we don't say it

[01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:48.660]
It's that French thing, it's the buff on due

[01:42:48.660 --> 01:42:52.140]
No, no, it wasn't the fondue, that was your confusing him with the Scalia

[01:42:52.140 --> 01:42:53.400]
Oh, that's right, you're right

[01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:56.940]
No, no, he was doing the one with the D head deal

[01:42:57.420 --> 01:42:58.460]
That's right, right

[01:42:58.460 --> 01:43:00.400]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60

[01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:02.040]
WQIN, hello

[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:04.880]
QIN? Canada

[01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:06.000]
I beg your pardon?

[01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:07.860]
Illegal alien Canada

[01:43:07.860 --> 01:43:10.940]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[01:43:10.940 --> 01:43:14.000]
I got news for you, you're an illegal alien no matter where you are

[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:15.000]
Even if you're on Uranus

[01:43:15.780 --> 01:43:16.620]
WQIN, hello

[01:43:16.620 --> 01:43:17.620]
Hey Neil, how you doing?

[01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:18.300]
Pretty good

[01:43:18.300 --> 01:43:19.980]
How about solving two problems?

[01:43:20.300 --> 01:43:22.580]
Why don't you put chicken neck on from 2 to 4

[01:43:22.580 --> 01:43:23.560]
That way we'll get a paycheck

[01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:25.700]
Yeah, that's a good idea, get him off my back

[01:43:25.700 --> 01:43:29.060]
No more Paul Harvey bits, no one's coming in?

[01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:29.760]
No

[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:31.220]
No, I like this

[01:43:31.220 --> 01:43:34.820]
Well, I'm happy for you, okay, we'll pass that along to the powers that be

[01:43:35.340 --> 01:43:37.460]
Every time he calls you once you're a Paul Harvey bit

[01:43:37.460 --> 01:43:40.000]
I mean some of them are kind of amusing, they're okay

[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.760]
Right, they're not exactly my favorite rights, but they're all right

[01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:45.040]
But let me see if I can find one that's really a hoot

[01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:46.360]
Do you think there's one that's really good?

[01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:49.820]
Uh, let's see

[01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:52.500]
Good morning, Americans, it's Paul

[01:43:52.500 --> 01:43:54.660]
Paul Harvey, stand by for news

[01:43:54.660 --> 01:44:00.060]
A couple had two little boys, Johnny and Jimmy, ages 8 and 10, who were

[01:44:00.060 --> 01:44:01.820]
excessively mischievous

[01:44:02.500 --> 01:44:05.640]
The two were always getting into trouble and their parents could be

[01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:10.380]
confident that if any mischief occurred in their town, Johnny and Jimmy were

[01:44:10.380 --> 01:44:12.820]
involved in some capacity

[01:44:12.820 --> 01:44:16.480]
Their parents were at their wit's end as to what to do about their son's

[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:16.960]
behavior

[01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:21.920]
So they heard that a clergyman in town had been successful in

[01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:26.720]
disciplining children in the past, so they contacted him and he agreed to

[01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:27.780]
give it his best shot

[01:44:27.780 --> 01:44:33.240]
He asked to see the boys individually, so Johnny the eight-year-old was

[01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:37.580]
sent to meet first with the clergyman, who sat Johnny down and asked

[01:44:37.580 --> 01:44:38.980]
him sternly where is God?

[01:44:39.780 --> 01:44:44.000]
Johnny made no response, so the clergyman repeated the question in an even

[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.640]
stoner tone, where is God?

[01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:50.740]
Johnny again made no attempt to answer the clergyman raised his voice,

[01:44:50.740 --> 01:44:54.460]
even more and shook his finger in the voice face, where is God?

[01:44:55.520 --> 01:44:59.320]
And at that, Johnny bolted from the room, ran directly home and slammed

[01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:00.380]
himself in the closet

[01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:04.300]
His brother, Jimmy, followed him into the closet and said, well what happened?

[01:45:04.780 --> 01:45:08.620]
Johnny said, we're in big trouble this time, Jimmy God is missing and they think

[01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:10.220]
we did it, Paul Harvey

[01:45:10.740 --> 01:45:14.220]
Good day, good day, sir, it was kind of cute, he liked that

[01:45:14.740 --> 01:45:16.340]
Thank you, after it was fine, alright

[01:45:16.340 --> 01:45:17.300]
Somebody QAM, hello

[01:45:18.380 --> 01:45:20.880]
I got a suggestion for the 2 to 4 hour

[01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:22.680]
How about all mobs?

[01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:24.540]
Mobs?

[01:45:24.940 --> 01:45:29.880]
Yeah, all mobs, all the time and all the pieces

[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:34.420]
Mobs, and then what's that guy's name that you went to see?

[01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:36.640]
You who has shy fits, so whatever, right?

[01:45:37.460 --> 01:45:39.840]
Yeah, who's a shy fit, plays the violin from 2 to 4?

[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:42.760]
I guarantee you could break a one share, that's what we had last two trends

[01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:45.660]
with Mowazan, all this crap about brain mobs back

[01:45:45.660 --> 01:45:48.380]
If you liked mobs, how come you didn't put it on when he was on it?

[01:45:48.500 --> 01:45:49.380]
How come you didn't write it down?

[01:45:52.500 --> 01:45:53.880]
That's the thing that I don't understand

[01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:56.420]
If you liked him a lot, how come he didn't write it down?

[01:45:56.500 --> 01:45:57.540]
He was good for a few yucks

[01:45:57.540 --> 01:45:58.980]
Don't even add

[01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:00.440]
W-Q-A-M, hello

[01:46:01.820 --> 01:46:03.040]
Q-A-M, hello

[01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:05.600]
Wink and suds, 2 to 4

[01:46:08.100 --> 01:46:09.100]
That's why I like him

[01:46:09.100 --> 01:46:10.840]
Yeah, that was Gilbert, we should put him in

[01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:12.080]
No, that was not, it was

[01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:13.700]
It was, it was, get out of here

[01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:17.040]
It was, I thought it was somebody doing a blind mic

[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:20.300]
That was Gilbert, Wink and suds, 2 to 4

[01:46:20.300 --> 01:46:22.160]
Yeah, they would talk to you, Rick would talk to you

[01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:23.120]
He talked to all the losers

[01:46:23.740 --> 01:46:24.820]
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[01:46:24.820 --> 01:46:27.340]
And of course there was Alex Venet, he thought he was going to make...

[01:46:27.340 --> 01:46:30.700]
You know, you could roll Rick anything like, hey, you know, go bird's eyes

[01:46:30.700 --> 01:46:31.460]
You know, of course, hard ass

[01:46:31.460 --> 01:46:32.860]
Hard ass red-knit

[01:46:32.860 --> 01:46:34.060]
That's a stock market thing, it's boring

[01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:37.120]
No, you couldn't tell me anything because he was a legend in his own mind

[01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:38.820]
That's why he's out in Moan Long Hospital

[01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:40.220]
Who were you, and Gary

[01:46:40.220 --> 01:46:41.560]
I remember how both were brought used to Moan his lungs

[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:43.220]
I think he's Moan Booker's lungs long now

[01:46:43.220 --> 01:46:44.940]
He would wear his lungs well, he did it too

[01:46:44.940 --> 01:46:45.520]
Really?

[01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:48.820]
You know, and again, but that was the same story

[01:46:48.820 --> 01:46:50.540]
You know, some people were good in the afternoon

[01:46:50.540 --> 01:46:52.740]
Like Hank and Rick and suds

[01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:53.820]
And then they put him out in the morning

[01:46:53.820 --> 01:46:55.380]
And everybody was going well like

[01:46:56.160 --> 01:46:56.480]
What?

[01:46:57.040 --> 01:46:57.800]
What would you do that?

[01:46:58.240 --> 01:46:58.880]
Why would you do that?

[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:00.100]
Some people are afternoon people

[01:47:00.100 --> 01:47:01.680]
And they do very, very well, they belong there

[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:02.760]
And then they put him in the morning

[01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:03.940]
And like, give my handy craft

[01:47:03.940 --> 01:47:05.600]
And like, oh, is he, how come he's not doing great?

[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:06.780]
Right? Sorry?

[01:47:06.780 --> 01:47:09.160]
I mean, you know exactly what I'm talking about

[01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:10.120]
I'm talking about, I don't know, I'm still like

[01:47:10.120 --> 01:47:11.600]
You're doing your little tap dance now

[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:13.140]
Just going to hear the communication next week

[01:47:13.140 --> 01:47:14.820]
You're thinking the sides of the sand

[01:47:14.820 --> 01:47:16.940]
So that's where the Rick and suds days before and after

[01:47:16.940 --> 01:47:17.920]
And the same thing here

[01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:18.520]
Right

[01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:20.780]
That's the Pete Bulger School of Programming

[01:47:20.780 --> 01:47:21.600]
Just shut the deck

[01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:23.180]
Keep shuffling the deck, that's right

[01:47:23.180 --> 01:47:24.960]
Shuffle the deck, shuffle the deck, shuffle the deck

[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:27.340]
And keep hoping that there's something lands right, you know?

[01:47:27.620 --> 01:47:28.720]
No, never mind, you have a following

[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:31.960]
That's what he specializes in when he had the light bulb under his tutelage there

[01:47:31.960 --> 01:47:33.960]
For a little while, Pete Bulger was under his tutelage

[01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:36.020]
And believe me, from what I heard about his tutelage

[01:47:36.020 --> 01:47:37.120]
Nobody would want to be under that

[01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:38.980]
Like being under a dark cloud

[01:47:39.340 --> 01:47:39.700]
God

[01:47:39.700 --> 01:47:42.380]
And he just kept shuffling him around and shuffling him around

[01:47:42.380 --> 01:47:44.960]
Oh yeah, let's put, you know, uh, what's your name?

[01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:46.580]
Joyce Kaufman on in the afternoon

[01:47:46.580 --> 01:47:47.880]
Let's put her on in the morning now

[01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:49.480]
Let's put normal back on here

[01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:51.520]
I mean, anybody would put normal on here in the first place

[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:52.380]
Needs mental health

[01:47:52.380 --> 01:47:53.400]
Get with it normal

[01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:55.180]
Okay, get that joebell straightened out

[01:47:55.180 --> 01:47:58.000]
Get some of this stuff done and quit talking a good game

[01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:27.980]
Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap

[01:48:57.980 --> 01:49:27.980]

[01:49:27.980 --> 01:49:36.800]
There are some sunrise, sunny-house 괜찮 colors, задач we call 9-5-4, 572-32, the world planting,

You can throw in Texas too.

[01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:10.520]
You can't use the game, waiting, not breathing more on their afraid of attacks.

[01:50:11.380 --> 01:50:13.660]
But Mexico is not salty facts.

[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:19.560]
No bombing beaters, but they might instead throw dirty sneakers at your head.

[01:50:20.180 --> 01:50:22.640]
Watch your head crash, your head crash, they're a punk.

[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:24.260]
Just call them a punk.

[01:50:24.260 --> 01:50:27.640]
Just, they only threat that I can see.

[01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:31.200]
We got real crap, blim, serious crap, blim.

[01:50:32.260 --> 01:50:33.980]
But no one takes that through the streets.

[01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:37.240]
You give me Agenda Loot app.

[01:50:38.180 --> 01:50:40.460]
You give me Agenda Loot app.

[01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:45.320]
Side out your life with your reports on unemployed people, right folks.

[01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:47.440]
Get that good talking bad China.

[01:50:48.180 --> 01:50:51.680]
Nobody could have done a fine job or two fine moves.

[01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:54.360]
Who are you? Who buy? Who's sky?

[01:50:56.480 --> 01:51:00.260]
Who are you? Who buy? Who do you do?

[01:51:00.580 --> 01:51:00.820]
Who buy?

[01:51:01.900 --> 01:51:07.260]
Come 18 at 560 speaking of ease that come up a two again, like it or not from the Bank of Lines Senate.

[01:51:07.260 --> 01:51:10.160]
I don't really know because he's only got, he's only got knee-in votes.

[01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:12.280]
And probably most of those are Robert Greeper.

[01:51:12.660 --> 01:51:16.640]
Anytime you see the number, you know Robert Greeper's fine finger is in it.

[01:51:16.860 --> 01:51:18.060]
You know what I'm saying? Deep in it.

[01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:20.180]
Wait until you hear this story.

[01:51:20.280 --> 01:51:21.520]
This is his story.

[01:51:21.700 --> 01:51:23.760]
I'm going to do the story.

[01:51:24.920 --> 01:51:25.660]
What's his facts?

[01:51:26.080 --> 01:51:28.680]
He's going to grind some of the Brandy's tech from Monday.

[01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:29.560]
He's going to grind.

[01:51:30.520 --> 01:51:31.480]
He's on top of it.

[01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:33.300]
He's doing his job because he's a real sales guy.

[01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:34.920]
Other than that, we ain't got much.

[01:51:35.320 --> 01:51:35.980]
We got Todd Dreck.

[01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:40.940]
And we got Hot Shot Brett from New York.

[01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:42.900]
From somewhere from Hungary.

[01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:46.560]
Tacoma Washington is just talking about taking a bite out of crime.

[01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:49.360]
Government lawyers tried to confiscate the gold truth caps,

[01:51:49.540 --> 01:51:52.620]
known as grills from the mouths of two men facing drug charges,

[01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:55.020]
saying that dental work qualified as seasonal assets.

[01:51:55.640 --> 01:51:57.580]
They had them in a vehicle headed to a dental clinic

[01:51:57.580 --> 01:52:00.660]
by the time the fence attorney is persuaded to judge the healthy procedure.

[01:52:01.100 --> 01:52:03.320]
They were going to yank the gold truth caps out of their mouth.

[01:52:03.580 --> 01:52:03.900]
The grills?

[01:52:04.340 --> 01:52:04.980]
Yeah, the grills.

[01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:08.040]
I've been doing this for over 30 years.

[01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:10.420]
And I've never heard of anything like this.

[01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:12.620]
Richard J. Trouberman, a past president of Washington

[01:52:12.620 --> 01:52:14.380]
Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.

[01:52:14.380 --> 01:52:17.940]
It sounds like Nazi Germany, when they were removing the gold teeth from the bodies,

[01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:19.580]
released then they waited until they were dead.

[01:52:21.100 --> 01:52:21.900]
Good point.

[01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:23.680]
Oh, you can't take my grill.

[01:52:24.380 --> 01:52:25.320]
The prosecutor said,

[01:52:25.860 --> 01:52:26.000]
Why?

[01:52:26.340 --> 01:52:28.320]
Think I'm chilling while your phone going from a grill in?

[01:52:28.720 --> 01:52:28.900]
Yeah.

[01:52:29.300 --> 01:52:30.220]
Let's do a little drill in.

[01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:30.680]
What do you say?

[01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:34.240]
Prosecutors had a warrant to seize the gold dental work for the documents

[01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:35.420]
and lawyers involved in the case.

[01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:37.940]
But they eventually abandoned the efforts, say they mistakenly thought

[01:52:37.940 --> 01:52:39.240]
the grills were removable.

[01:52:39.660 --> 01:52:41.840]
They were like a plate, like my used to have.

[01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:42.260]
Right.

[01:52:42.660 --> 01:52:45.260]
Customized tooth caps popularized by rappers, such as Nelly,

[01:52:45.740 --> 01:52:49.800]
are made of precious metals and jewels and cost $1,000 for a full set.

[01:52:50.140 --> 01:52:53.500]
Some can be snapped out of the teeth, while others are permanently bonded out of the teeth.

[01:52:54.020 --> 01:52:56.060]
Flennard, teen eel junior, old flennard.

[01:52:56.260 --> 01:52:56.780]
Hey, Flennie.

[01:52:57.260 --> 01:53:00.020]
And Donald Jamar Lewis, both at primarily bonded grills.

[01:53:00.520 --> 01:53:03.560]
Neil and Lewis, both charged with several drug and weapons violations were taken to.

[01:53:03.640 --> 01:53:06.300]
They, from the federal defense incident in the US Marshal's Orifice,

[01:53:06.700 --> 01:53:08.740]
whether or told the government had a warrant to seize their grills.

[01:53:09.340 --> 01:53:11.720]
Oh, God, I wonder if you can make a good burger on those.

[01:53:11.720 --> 01:53:15.580]
They called their lawyers as they were about to be taken to a dentist at Miriam Schwartz,

[01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:17.680]
Neil's Public Defender, Miriam Schwartz.

[01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:22.820]
A permanent stay at the seizure order was that day by US-Magestor AJ Kelly Arnold.

[01:53:23.340 --> 01:53:24.720]
Was that day at Megazins?

[01:53:25.060 --> 01:53:27.220]
Acid forfeiture is a fairly routine procedure,

[01:53:27.580 --> 01:53:30.300]
and our attorney is running the impression that these snapped out like a retainer.

[01:53:30.580 --> 01:53:34.820]
The defense force criticized what they said was a clandestine attempt to have the grills removed.

[01:53:35.260 --> 01:53:37.220]
It would be a thrill to yank out your grill.

[01:53:37.860 --> 01:53:40.500]
It's shocking that this kind of action by the federal government could be sought

[01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:43.780]
in a complex and secret without anyone being notified by the federal government,

[01:53:43.880 --> 01:53:46.800]
say, said Xenon Peter Olberts, who represents Lewis,

[01:53:47.080 --> 01:53:49.660]
reminds me of the secret detentions in those terrorist cases.

[01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:52.140]
They're going to pull out your, they're going to yank out your grill, okay?

[01:53:52.440 --> 01:53:54.480]
That's what this Nazi government of ours is doing now.

[01:53:54.860 --> 01:53:56.780]
They're going to get a real thrill by yanking out your grill.

[01:53:57.220 --> 01:53:58.940]
So cut the crap. Sounds kind of...

[01:53:58.940 --> 01:53:59.260]
You guys!

[01:53:59.500 --> 01:53:59.780]
...to me.

[01:54:01.540 --> 01:54:02.520]
I don't know what to do.

[01:54:02.640 --> 01:54:03.440]
No, get rid of him.

[01:54:04.300 --> 01:54:05.360]
263 votes on a pool.

[01:54:05.540 --> 01:54:06.880]
Boy, that's in less than an hour.

[01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:08.600]
This is almost like old time.

[01:54:08.700 --> 01:54:09.860]
Can we do this for old time's sake?

[01:54:09.860 --> 01:54:11.020]
See, I told you, man.

[01:54:11.380 --> 01:54:12.540]
We got to like, start...

[01:54:12.540 --> 01:54:14.120]
We can't worry about the other 20 hours.

[01:54:14.200 --> 01:54:16.580]
I said that a few days ago, and then I thought, like, I shouldn't have said that.

[01:54:16.660 --> 01:54:17.220]
I shouldn't have said it.

[01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:18.080]
I know it's hard.

[01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:18.940]
That would be a way.

[01:54:19.020 --> 01:54:21.300]
You know, we like to be a team player no matter what stage it is,

[01:54:21.340 --> 01:54:23.060]
and the occasion to get queues to well, you know,

[01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:24.560]
near what everybody by which is crap.

[01:54:24.740 --> 01:54:26.880]
You know, nobody promotes the other shows more than I do.

[01:54:27.060 --> 01:54:30.580]
But, but, you know, we got to start taking care of business here from Tentative 2,

[01:54:30.620 --> 01:54:33.900]
because the rest of this thing is crumbling like a smashed grill.

[01:54:34.860 --> 01:54:35.500]
Yeah, ain't good.

[01:54:35.680 --> 01:54:37.840]
Crumbling like that tooth of mine last a couple weeks ago.

[01:54:37.900 --> 01:54:38.160]
Remember that?

[01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:38.640]
That's right.

[01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:41.200]
That you get some grilling when you went in there?

[01:54:41.580 --> 01:54:42.240]
Oh, no.

[01:54:42.740 --> 01:54:44.380]
Ice Raid South Florida head shops.

[01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:45.040]
Uh-oh.

[01:54:45.440 --> 01:54:49.160]
You would think that a Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement Ice

[01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:53.280]
Division, formerly INS, would be busy fighting terrorism and securing the borders,

[01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:54.820]
but you'd be wrong.

[01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:58.180]
According, this is from a website called StopTheDrugWord.org.

[01:54:58.740 --> 01:55:02.600]
According to Ice, at least part of its mission is to keep America bomb-free.

[01:55:02.780 --> 01:55:03.360]
You hear that, George?

[01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:04.240]
Bomb-free.

[01:55:04.860 --> 01:55:06.140]
It's the bomb show.

[01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:07.160]
Free bugs?

[01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:11.500]
Some of its special agents spent last Friday serving federal search and seizure warrants

[01:55:11.500 --> 01:55:14.400]
against five South Florida head shops all in the Gables area.

[01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:18.740]
In the Moral Gables area, the range resulted in the seizure of 5,500 drug-perfinated items

[01:55:18.740 --> 01:55:21.080]
worth more than 250 grand ice reports.

[01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:22.540]
What if they got any grilles?

[01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:25.340]
The raiders didn't limit themselves to pipes and bongs, however.

[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:29.940]
They also seized rolling papers and stash containers designed to look like commercial products

[01:55:29.940 --> 01:55:33.340]
such as women's lipstick, chews and pages.

[01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:34.340]
Rolling papers?

[01:55:34.540 --> 01:55:36.280]
So what are we going to start writing the circle K?

[01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:37.560]
They're next up a little farther.

[01:55:37.700 --> 01:55:37.940]
Monday?

[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:39.660]
They got the good stuff out here.

[01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:44.480]
These shops sell a dangerous lie about drugs and drug use.

[01:55:44.660 --> 01:55:49.400]
They say, Jesus, Tories, oh Jesus Christ, specially did in charge of ice in Miami.

[01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:51.700]
It's obvious they want people to think it's okay to take drugs.

[01:55:51.980 --> 01:55:53.240]
This is simply unacceptable.

[01:55:53.800 --> 01:55:54.080]
Unacceptible.

[01:55:54.340 --> 01:55:54.720]
Unacceptible.

[01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:55.700]
To take drugs.

[01:55:56.180 --> 01:55:58.020]
Did you know that when you're smoking a fat one you're taking drugs?

[01:55:58.200 --> 01:55:58.680]
I didn't know that.

[01:55:59.660 --> 01:56:02.500]
Under federal law, speaking of smoking by the way, when the hell are cigars getting here?

[01:56:02.540 --> 01:56:03.860]
I'm getting really pissed off at it.

[01:56:12.900 --> 01:56:14.100]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:56:14.540 --> 01:56:14.940]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:56:14.940 --> 01:56:14.940]

[01:56:14.940 --> 01:56:14.940]

[01:56:14.940 --> 01:56:15.500]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:56:15.740 --> 01:56:16.160]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:16.980]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:56:16.980 --> 01:56:17.440]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:56:17.440 --> 01:56:17.440]

[01:56:17.440 --> 01:56:17.440]

[01:56:17.440 --> 01:56:17.940]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:56:17.940 --> 01:56:18.000]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:18.360]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:18.620]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:56:18.620 --> 01:56:18.860]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:56:20.700 --> 01:56:21.100]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:22.520]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:24.800]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:25.380]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:56:25.380 --> 01:56:28.100]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:56:31.120 --> 01:56:32.600]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:56:33.060 --> 01:56:33.840]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:45.000]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:45.200]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:56:45.200 --> 01:56:45.200]

[01:56:45.200 --> 01:56:45.200]

[01:56:45.200 --> 01:56:45.220]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:45.800]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:46.340]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:56:46.380 --> 01:56:47.380]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:56:47.380 --> 01:56:47.380]

[01:56:47.380 --> 01:56:47.940]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:56:47.940 --> 01:56:49.140]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:56:49.140 --> 01:56:49.940]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:56:49.940 --> 01:56:49.980]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:56:49.980 --> 01:56:51.000]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:56:51.140 --> 01:56:51.900]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:56:51.900 --> 01:56:52.080]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:56:52.100 --> 01:56:53.900]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:56:55.020 --> 01:56:55.320]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:56:55.320 --> 01:56:56.360]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:57:10.260 --> 01:57:10.260]

[01:57:10.260 --> 01:57:10.260]

[01:57:10.260 --> 01:57:10.260]

[01:57:10.260 --> 01:57:10.260]

[01:57:10.260 --> 01:57:10.260]

I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:18.180]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:19.040]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:20.380]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:57:20.980 --> 01:57:23.900]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:27.840]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:33.740]
I'm getting pissed off at it.

[01:57:33.740 --> 01:57:34.300]
Yeah.

[01:57:34.420 --> 01:57:35.280]
Matt Nice.

[01:57:35.400 --> 01:57:35.740]
Yeah.

[01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:35.760]

[01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:35.760]

[01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:36.860]
I'm actually going to go ahead.

[01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:37.720]
I'm actually going to go ahead.

[01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:37.940]
I'm actually going to go ahead.

[01:57:37.940 --> 01:57:38.900]
I'm actually going to go ahead.

[01:57:38.900 --> 01:57:39.040]
I'm actually going to go ahead.

[01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:39.660]
I'm actually going to go ahead.

[01:57:39.660 --> 01:57:40.260]
I'm actually going to go ahead.

[01:57:40.260 --> 01:57:40.880]
I'm actually going to go ahead.

[01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:41.200]
I'm actually going to go ahead.

[01:57:41.200 --> 01:57:42.000]

I'm actually going to go ahead.

[01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:45.380]
I'm actually going to go ahead.

[01:57:46.180 --> 01:57:47.300]
I'm actually going to go ahead.

[01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:48.860]
I'm actually going to go ahead.

[01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:51.740]
I'm actually going to go ahead.

[01:57:52.220 --> 01:57:55.140]
I'm actually going to go ahead.

[01:57:55.680 --> 01:58:00.920]
I'm actually going to go ahead.

[01:58:01.460 --> 01:58:03.720]
I'm actually going to go ahead.

[01:58:03.740 --> 01:58:04.760]
Curtis 22.

[01:58:05.080 --> 01:58:05.660]
The big O.

[01:58:06.120 --> 01:58:06.560]
19.

[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:08.100]
I bet you those bring back moat.

[01:58:08.180 --> 01:58:09.040]
That's probably from across the street.

[01:58:09.040 --> 01:58:09.040]

[01:58:09.040 --> 01:58:09.200]
That's probably from across the street.

[01:58:09.720 --> 01:58:10.480]
I bet you those bring back moat.

[01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:10.480]

[01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:10.480]

[01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:10.480]

[01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:10.480]

[01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:10.480]

[01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:10.480]

[01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:11.000]
I bet you those bring back moat.

[01:58:11.020 --> 01:58:13.500]
I bet you those bring back moat.

[01:58:13.500 --> 01:58:14.140]
I bet you those bring back moat.

I bet you those bring back moat.

[01:59:03.640 --> 01:59:05.820]
We'll drive you to madness.

[01:59:05.820 --> 01:59:05.820]

[01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:10.480]
It will make you pluck out your eyeballs just to see what's under the dresser.

[01:59:11.060 --> 01:59:11.160]
It will make you pluck out your eyeballs just to see what's under the dresser.

[01:59:11.160 --> 01:59:13.400]
The world as you know it will cease to exist.

[01:59:13.400 --> 01:59:13.520]
The world as you know it will cease to exist.

[01:59:13.880 --> 01:59:13.880]

[01:59:13.900 --> 01:59:15.520]
You will enter alternate realities like being trampled to death by fat and furious Jamaican women.

[01:59:15.520 --> 01:59:19.740]
You will enter alternate realities like being trampled to death by fat and furious Jamaican women.

[01:59:20.400 --> 01:59:26.040]
In fact, some of the study studies have shown that Mariana causes polio and will make your balls

[01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:28.900]
and will make your balls drivel up into tiny little beebeams.

[01:59:29.360 --> 01:59:31.780]
In fact, some of the studies have shown that Mariana causes polio and will make your balls drivel up into tiny little beebeams.

[01:59:31.780 --> 01:59:33.640]
We gotta believe this.

[01:59:33.940 --> 01:59:35.660]
We have to say things like that.

[01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:37.500]
Opened up sexy bad too.

[01:59:37.700 --> 01:59:40.260]
This was a trade war by the partners against pun in America.

[01:59:50.540 --> 01:59:51.280]
That's not mine!

[01:59:51.560 --> 01:59:52.140]
Are you sure?

[01:59:52.860 --> 01:59:54.880]
When you just won't be giving to you, you can really get it.

[01:59:54.880 --> 01:59:55.600]
You will be fine.

[01:59:55.640 --> 01:59:56.660]
Fine, fine, fine.

[01:59:57.020 --> 01:59:58.400]
When you just sing it, it's on you.

[01:59:58.540 --> 01:59:59.220]
You'll smoke it in the ball.

[02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:26.660]
интерlude will come at five dua fai fai ten只

[02:00:26.660 --> 02:00:30.680]
It's so dark and blue, it's coming by by by by by

[02:00:30.680 --> 02:00:34.820]
Let's go, let's go survive Let's go survive

[02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:39.260]
Let's go survive Let's go survive

[02:00:39.260 --> 02:00:44.300]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, let's go survive Let's go

[02:00:58.860 --> 02:00:59.560]
Everybody's solo!

[02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:20.800]
Well, they're supposed to be some words here, but I forgot because I spoke to you word by

[02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:24.720]
I went to Laos, Blues and everybody out there was multiplied

[02:01:31.660 --> 02:01:32.300]
Oh!

[02:01:33.540 --> 02:01:34.860]
Oh, those are going

[02:01:34.860 --> 02:01:38.860]
Let's go survive

[02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:55.920]
About 33 a.k.w. I want to know though you should feel real safe over the weekend

[02:01:55.920 --> 02:01:59.100]
This drill reassuring, even though it's a Brit story from London

[02:01:59.100 --> 02:02:03.360]
British anti-terrorism detectives has scored a demand from a plane after a taxi driver

[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:08.760]
earlier becomes suspicious when he started singing along to a track by punk band the clash

[02:02:08.760 --> 02:02:10.180]
For the other one

[02:02:10.180 --> 02:02:12.780]
When they make you suspicious, well which track was it no later?

[02:02:12.880 --> 02:02:14.020]
Well, we'll get to that, just relax

[02:02:14.620 --> 02:02:18.260]
Detectives halted the London bomb flight at Durham T's Valley Airport in Northern England

[02:02:18.260 --> 02:02:23.280]
And Haraj Man, who arrived, sounds like one of them, Shmata Head, 24 was taken off the plane

[02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:25.880]
The taxi driver become worried on the way to the airport because

[02:02:25.880 --> 02:02:31.440]
Man had been singing along to the clashes 1979 anthem London Calling, which features the lyrics

[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:36.700]
Now war is declared and battle come down while other lines warn of a meltdown expected

[02:02:36.700 --> 02:02:40.360]
Man told British newspapers the taxi had been fitted with a music system

[02:02:40.360 --> 02:02:43.460]
Wish a lot of him to plug in his MP3 player and he had been playing the clash

[02:02:43.900 --> 02:02:45.820]
Prokoharam led Zeppelin and the Beatles to the driver

[02:02:45.820 --> 02:02:50.480]
He didn't like Led Zeppelin to the clash but I don't think there was any need to tell a police man told the Daily Mirror

[02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:54.440]
A Durham police spokesman said Man had been released after questioning but had missed his flight

[02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:59.220]
The report was made with the best of intentions and we wouldn't want to discourage people from contacting us with

[02:03:00.860 --> 02:03:06.060]
So if you're going to listen to the clash, London Calling, they're going to like call your ass and give it a good grilling

[02:03:06.060 --> 02:03:08.260]
And then steal your grill, I like that

[02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:14.600]
56670560, let's do another sweep, another phone call sweep here, a thousand in a row, okay?

[02:03:14.980 --> 02:03:18.640]
50,000 calls in a row, we got Geltie from the entrance center with 2 this afternoon

[02:03:18.640 --> 02:03:23.460]
Because the Panthers are playing Sid Crosby in the penguins tonight, and that promo, Sid Crosby

[02:03:23.460 --> 02:03:28.580]
If you're going to do promo for the Panthers, at least get it right, nobody calls him Sid

[02:03:28.580 --> 02:03:32.080]
Sid the kid maybe, but not Sid, Sid me, okay? Sid me

[02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:35.260]

Good afternoon, when is Todd today, Sid me go?

[02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:06.080]
Hey, I'm just on, thank you for the Dreamfields' pasta, I had my fiancee get some, the first week you had mentioned it

[02:04:06.080 --> 02:04:08.800]
Yeah, and I actually have a lot of fun

[02:04:08.800 --> 02:04:14.020]
Believe her not, and actually my blood pressure has gone down too, I have no hypertension and things

[02:04:14.020 --> 02:04:17.660]
It's fine, I think you're a hemorrhage too if you put it into my place

[02:04:17.660 --> 02:04:19.960]
I can never hold it good, my boyfriend never heard anything

[02:04:19.960 --> 02:04:21.660]
I go sit on a box right now, thanks

[02:04:23.140 --> 02:04:26.140]
56670560, pound 5C, it's either feast or famine, you know what I mean?

[02:04:26.500 --> 02:04:29.620]
First they were saying nothing about it, and now we're getting like so many calls, it sounds like a setup

[02:04:29.620 --> 02:04:32.460]
It's starting to start to hurt a little fishy to me, you know

[02:04:32.460 --> 02:04:35.320]
Well fishy though, was that awful and nasty stuff, what was that call?

[02:04:35.740 --> 02:04:37.600]
Oh, sure, it's hockey me, it's hockey

[02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:42.460]
Oh, don't ever tell anybody I had talked about that stuff, God that was bad

[02:04:42.460 --> 02:04:48.140]
It was like a poop away, it was just like sneaker laces, not true laces but sneaker laces, you know white

[02:04:48.140 --> 02:04:50.660]
Uh-huh, real bad

[02:04:50.660 --> 02:04:55.260]
Oh, look at this chronic, chronic rust, the chronic encoco, see I told you this chronic

[02:04:55.260 --> 02:05:00.900]
I'm going pulled, being conducted by AOL today, which party would you prefer to control Congress?

[02:05:01.360 --> 02:05:05.460]
So far, 129, almost 130,000 votes, 101,000 votes,

[02:05:06.260 --> 02:05:17.580]
Democrats 66% Republicans, 26% other 9% says, wow have a fine weekend, T.C. chronic encoco, well you know that's great but today is only the 7th of April, elections on November 7th or other, 1st week in November

[02:05:17.580 --> 02:05:25.840]
And knowing that Democrat party as well as I do, and also knowing that Republicans and all these shenanigans they can pull, like maybe another terrorist attack or something convenient like that

[02:05:26.360 --> 02:05:34.260]
It wouldn't surprise me to see that Democrats say, that's their speciality man, yanking defeat from the draws of victory, they can do it like nobody else

[02:05:34.260 --> 02:05:39.040]
You'll see, I hope I'm wrong but don't start counting votes yet, unless you got the right machine

[02:05:39.040 --> 02:05:43.500]
Somebody QAM, hello, and we know the Republicans have the right machines man

[02:05:43.500 --> 02:05:48.920]
Somebody QAM, hello, not there, boy this is a real sad turn of events, you know what, it's all your fault Russ

[02:05:48.920 --> 02:05:52.680]
Somebody QAM, hello, QAM

[02:05:52.680 --> 02:05:57.900]
Hey, Neil, yes sir, who still use rolling papers, haven't they heard of Blanc?

[02:05:59.060 --> 02:06:01.340]
Still use Blanc, there's a bastard roll you weed in today

[02:06:01.900 --> 02:06:02.760]
Yeah, can we know?

[02:06:02.960 --> 02:06:05.220]
All right then, shall we get rid of the roll, it won't get full

[02:06:05.220 --> 02:06:08.340]
Okay, get rid of the paper man, that's not easy to do

[02:06:08.900 --> 02:06:11.680]
Yeah, so you have to have a certain technique, Sigourney weaver will show how to do it

[02:06:12.080 --> 02:06:14.340]
She didn't have to have to practice and she did it pretty good

[02:06:14.340 --> 02:06:17.540]
Well they got machines for that, they got a good machine to do that now

[02:06:17.540 --> 02:06:19.540]
Where, where those places that are getting busted

[02:06:19.540 --> 02:06:21.100]
Oh, yeah all of them headshots

[02:06:21.740 --> 02:06:25.640]
I don't know, they got headshots here, I don't see anybody rating or putting them out of business

[02:06:25.640 --> 02:06:27.600]
I just, that's amazing to me, it's just, no it's not

[02:06:27.600 --> 02:06:28.640]
It's par for the course

[02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.180]
Thank God they don't got no other places at Amsterdam

[02:06:31.180 --> 02:06:35.060]
Where you guys are going to be traveling off to with all that money that you're going to be getting back and expated

[02:06:35.060 --> 02:06:39.040]
Oh yeah, they're going to put a little, when Joe Bell comes back from the West Coast

[02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:40.420]
He's going to have a big stack of cash

[02:06:40.420 --> 02:06:43.380]
Just like Sandy Claus, because that's what he wants to be anyway, you know

[02:06:43.380 --> 02:06:47.640]
He wants to be the good humor man, he's going to be rolling or handing out hundreds here, thousands there

[02:06:47.640 --> 02:06:50.400]
Wait till he gives you that billion dollar bill, that's going to be a real hoot

[02:06:50.400 --> 02:06:52.360]
You know that purple one would Joyce's picture on it

[02:06:53.040 --> 02:06:54.900]
Actually it's Joyce's ass on it

[02:06:55.300 --> 02:06:56.360]
Dominic Q-A-M, hello

[02:06:57.200 --> 02:06:58.200]
Q-A-M, hello

[02:06:59.020 --> 02:07:00.520]
Q-A-M

[02:07:00.940 --> 02:07:02.540]
Speak to him

[02:07:02.540 --> 02:07:02.980]
Speaking

[02:07:02.980 --> 02:07:08.760]
Yeah, I was looking all over the internet for finding where the Getschke ward or the origin of it

[02:07:08.760 --> 02:07:10.720]
I can't get anything, can you help me with it?

[02:07:10.840 --> 02:07:11.440]
Where what is?

[02:07:11.820 --> 02:07:14.920]
Getschke, I love the ward that you keep viewing but I can't find it

[02:07:14.920 --> 02:07:18.800]
Oh you're looking for Getschke, he's just going to the Evadec in you'll find thousands of them

[02:07:18.800 --> 02:07:21.420]
Or just go to South Beach, you'll find them all over there

[02:07:21.420 --> 02:07:24.780]
Not South Beach, I mean whatever the North Beach, whatever that is

[02:07:24.780 --> 02:07:29.140]
It was the way Arthur Godfrey Road where that virulent anti-Semite used to hang out

[02:07:29.140 --> 02:07:33.660]
And you'll see all of them Getschke's, in fact, wait till about June or July, what it gets to be about 140 degrees in the shade

[02:07:34.040 --> 02:07:38.840]
And they all got the big hats and really heavy coats on and the outfits and the beards out of their knee

[02:07:38.840 --> 02:07:43.680]
Well I tell you one thing, if they ever skinned any they don't have to worry about all they got to do is put their stick their beard on it

[02:07:43.680 --> 02:07:44.920]
Soak up all of that blood

[02:07:46.100 --> 02:07:46.420]
Getschke

[02:07:46.420 --> 02:07:49.980]
And of course when I was talking about the Haseedum, I mean they're good post-toothed children

[02:07:49.980 --> 02:07:55.220]
But just take a look at all the guys roll around on those magic carpets with their rectum up high in the air

[02:07:55.220 --> 02:07:57.740]
So what's the difference between a Getschke and a Shmendrick?

[02:07:58.640 --> 02:08:01.300]
There's no relationship with Shmendrick, he's just like a Shmuck

[02:08:01.300 --> 02:08:03.160]
What Shmendrick got to do with Getschke?

[02:08:03.480 --> 02:08:03.940]
Of course, why?

[02:08:04.080 --> 02:08:04.080]

[02:08:05.480 --> 02:08:06.480]
That's one of the askin'

[02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:08.820]
Well I wish Mendrick has gotten out of religious thing

[02:08:08.820 --> 02:08:11.240]
I don't know Getschke, his first name is Haim

[02:08:11.240 --> 02:08:14.120]
There's always Haim Shmendrick who is like a specific Getschke

[02:08:14.120 --> 02:08:14.560]
Okay

[02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:18.700]
I tell you one thing, if I see a bunch of Muslims with their ass open to hear their words awfully

[02:08:18.700 --> 02:08:22.260]
I could be wrong with this is meal wrong

[02:08:22.260 --> 02:08:23.600]
Are they arguing on this carpets?

[02:08:23.740 --> 02:08:26.380]
This is 5.62.8

[02:08:26.380 --> 02:08:30.120]
And up with the Panthers already

[02:08:30.720 --> 02:08:34.800]
When the hell knows the baseball season begin anyway, huh?

[02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:47.120]
Jumpin' on cowsheets

[02:08:47.700 --> 02:08:50.260]
He's mayor of the crowd cheer

[02:08:52.200 --> 02:08:55.600]
Zoggin' a foul scienceology

[02:09:00.120 --> 02:09:01.420]
He's very in cave

[02:09:03.260 --> 02:09:06.080]
Who will they show their age?

[02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:11.160]
Who are they new blood by our team?

[02:09:15.020 --> 02:09:19.520]
Tom Cruise has got to be the king of holy milk

[02:09:22.260 --> 02:09:26.460]
When he talks now, do you expect us to fall?

[02:09:28.560 --> 02:09:30.080]
Thank you

[02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:35.620]
The Tom Cruise should go in front of the body

[02:09:35.620 --> 02:09:41.800]
Because his mind has turned into purple clothes

[02:09:45.140 --> 02:09:47.980]
They lost in a black hole

[02:09:49.120 --> 02:09:51.920]
Since he's split with the cold

[02:09:53.420 --> 02:09:57.460]
He's getting crazier by the day

[02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:03.060]
His an empty cover

[02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:07.160]
Since cellar on hover

[02:10:08.680 --> 02:10:12.580]
Should go a blow, act just brain cells away

[02:10:16.400 --> 02:10:21.180]
Tom Cruise has got to be the king of holy milk

[02:10:23.580 --> 02:10:28.220]
When for sex he's straight to the cycle war

[02:10:28.220 --> 02:10:29.320]
Absolutely

[02:10:30.440 --> 02:10:31.220]
Super

[02:10:31.220 --> 02:10:37.720]
He makes stupid claims and calls bad law or bad name

[02:10:37.720 --> 02:10:39.200]
And I know

[02:10:40.980 --> 02:10:44.520]
He's simply out of his door to find a thing

[02:10:44.520 --> 02:10:48.800]
Young denial of being clinically out of his door

[02:10:48.800 --> 02:10:51.200]
So I call it as looking for guest seasons for our new episode

[02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:53.600]
My website is called bubbygram.com

[02:10:54.220 --> 02:10:54.860]
Yiddish glossary

[02:10:54.860 --> 02:10:57.040]
I haven't found Gesheek for the time being

[02:10:57.040 --> 02:10:58.940]
There's only about 7,000 pages on this again

[02:10:58.940 --> 02:10:59.200]
Right?

[02:10:59.460 --> 02:11:00.220]
The highest spelled one

[02:11:00.220 --> 02:11:01.120]
How do you spell one?

[02:11:01.300 --> 02:11:01.740]
Getski

[02:11:01.740 --> 02:11:05.980]
I don't even know if that's how you spell it

[02:11:05.980 --> 02:11:06.340]
I don't know

[02:11:06.340 --> 02:11:08.940]
And most of the Yiddish words you never see in print

[02:11:08.940 --> 02:11:12.300]
Anyway, it says Yiddish arose around a thousand years ago from middle-high German

[02:11:12.300 --> 02:11:14.500]
And spreads throughout the ghettos of central eastern Europe

[02:11:14.500 --> 02:11:17.100]
Barrowing words in the countries in which the Jews lived

[02:11:17.100 --> 02:11:20.360]
Thus it incorporates words from Hebrew, Russian, Polish, other Slavic languages

[02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:22.380]
Romance languages and later English

[02:11:22.380 --> 02:11:25.960]
Before WWII Yiddish was spoken by more than 11 million people

[02:11:25.960 --> 02:11:28.320]
Today it's spoken by perhaps a tenth that many

[02:11:28.320 --> 02:11:31.020]
Many assimilated Ashkenazi American Jews

[02:11:31.020 --> 02:11:33.880]
Whose grandparents or great-grandparents only spoke Yiddish

[02:11:33.880 --> 02:11:36.620]
Or who spoke as their first language, barely know any words at all

[02:11:36.620 --> 02:11:38.720]
This is a shanda, a shame, a pity

[02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:41.540]
Many Yiddish words have entered the American English lexicon

[02:11:41.540 --> 02:11:45.180]
You'll find Maven, expert and Ghana thief in most dictionaries

[02:11:45.180 --> 02:11:48.360]
Words such as Schlepp, Schmachter, Naish, or regularly used in film

[02:11:48.360 --> 02:11:50.760]
On TV and books and magazines without translation

[02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:55.060]
The addition of Orion being with S.H.M. to donate something of little consequence

[02:11:55.060 --> 02:11:57.460]
Hospital, Schmospital, so long as you're healthy

[02:11:57.460 --> 02:12:00.700]
Is purely a English construct

[02:12:01.580 --> 02:12:06.020]
It's got examples of syntax that Jews use like smart, he isn't

[02:12:06.020 --> 02:12:09.820]
Sarcasm through innocuous diction, he only tried to shoot himself

[02:12:09.820 --> 02:12:12.780]
Scorns to reverse word order, already you're discouraged?

[02:12:14.940 --> 02:12:17.940]
Fearful cursive sanctioned by nominal cancellation

[02:12:17.940 --> 02:12:21.580]
May all your teeth fall out except one so you've never too late got forbid

[02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:24.420]
And then it goes to tell you how to pronounce CH

[02:12:24.820 --> 02:12:26.780]
As if you're cleaning from your throat

[02:12:27.320 --> 02:12:31.000]
As if your R is gently rolled as in a single R in Spanish or French

[02:12:31.860 --> 02:12:34.040]
Now let's see, I'm looking, we're never going to find

[02:12:34.040 --> 02:12:36.920]
Oh, I see these are alphabetical order, maybe I could have found Getski

[02:12:36.920 --> 02:12:39.340]
I'm going to have to go back to this, excuse me, I didn't realize

[02:12:39.340 --> 02:12:40.100]
Does it have Schmachter?

[02:12:40.580 --> 02:12:43.520]
Well, if I'm not to the G's yet, how can I be to the S's?

[02:12:43.580 --> 02:12:44.560]
I'm going to check the G's

[02:12:45.080 --> 02:12:47.300]
Yeah, it's got holy cheeses

[02:12:47.300 --> 02:12:50.320]
You have to eat a lot of cheeses to get enough flim in your throat

[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.140]
Alavai, or Abiga Zunz, as long as you're healthy

[02:12:53.140 --> 02:12:57.380]
Hospital, hospital, Abiga Zunz, Alavai, it's your only happen may have come to pass

[02:12:57.380 --> 02:12:59.920]
Alta Kaker, oh that's just our Florida thing

[02:12:59.920 --> 02:13:06.060]
Oi, literally an old, an old Schmitt, or as we say in English in old part

[02:13:06.060 --> 02:13:07.760]
Sometimes simply called AK

[02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:12.900]
Years ago my mother was trying to convince my then eight-year-old nephew that they actually knew quite a bit more yetiest and he realized

[02:13:12.900 --> 02:13:17.180]
For instance, you know what, another Kaker, she said knowing he'd used the word around him often

[02:13:17.180 --> 02:13:20.240]
Is face lit up, yes I know that one, it means a slow driver, he said

[02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:27.520]
Ghanif, literally America, oh America Ghanif, literally America the thief, which has both positive and negative connotations, Ghanif his thief

[02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:29.820]
Oh, there's words on here I never heard of

[02:13:29.820 --> 02:13:31.320]
Well, let's go, lay a load on it

[02:13:31.320 --> 02:13:33.700]
Oh, I know, I did this skull strange, Bala Busta, I see

[02:13:33.700 --> 02:13:37.420]
And if he didn't organize, I'm going to make a homemaker that Donna Reed was some Bala Busta

[02:13:37.420 --> 02:13:42.700]
I just, Beria, a Beria is a regular Martha Stewart, a homemaker who puts the rest of us to shame

[02:13:43.420 --> 02:13:47.000]
Byshert means its destiny was meant to be, fated to be, it's Byshert

[02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:54.000]
Bissle, give me a Bissolox on my bagel, would you darling? Bissle is like, oh, little is even like a little less than a Biss a little bit

[02:13:54.560 --> 02:13:59.060]
Breath, oh yeah, breath is a gag to vomit

[02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:01.120]
Braca, a prayer

[02:14:01.120 --> 02:14:01.600]
Right

[02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:05.980]
This is the first time in my life, I'm a hundred years old and I've never seen most of these in print

[02:14:05.980 --> 02:14:07.000]
Bubble Miser

[02:14:08.560 --> 02:14:11.840]
Literally a gram, sir, if you want to understand this show, you better go to this website

[02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:15.160]
boobygram.com slides you in the other's glossary, why?

[02:14:15.620 --> 02:14:18.360]
Now this is a better company, but listen to this show, bubble Miser

[02:14:18.800 --> 02:14:22.540]
Literally a grandmother's story, old wives tale, such as you better stop making that face

[02:14:22.540 --> 02:14:27.660]
I know a girl whose face froze like that, basically a story of dubious truth like the Bible for example

[02:14:27.660 --> 02:14:31.440]
Bubbala, an affection way of referring to someone much like darling or sweetheart, Bubbala

[02:14:31.440 --> 02:14:34.660]
Bubbie, grandmother, like Abuela

[02:14:35.240 --> 02:14:38.640]
Bubbcus, literally beans like what you guys are getting paid, colloquial nothing

[02:14:38.640 --> 02:14:40.500]
You're gonna assume you know what you're gonna get, Bubbcus

[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:47.340]
Yeah, oh hi, my uncle, I can't believe it, but say this in print, this is the best, a regular guy, nobody special any time to cure

[02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:48.980]
I do think too

[02:14:48.980 --> 02:14:52.140]
Hi, my uncle, yeah, that's right, I think he's the new sales manager

[02:14:52.140 --> 02:14:53.060]
Yeah, let's grill

[02:14:53.480 --> 02:14:57.380]
Oh, hi, a nasty shrewish, somewhat psychotic woman

[02:14:58.040 --> 02:15:03.180]
Woman, proud of all our prism anger, basically a bitch, are we a hi, hi, hi, hi, holla

[02:15:03.180 --> 02:15:05.820]
Oh yeah, of course you can't even know how to pay, pay, pay, pay, so

[02:15:05.820 --> 02:15:07.200]
Yeah, let's see

[02:15:07.200 --> 02:15:10.200]
Oh, here you go, I do and I tell you this one, how luscious

[02:15:10.200 --> 02:15:10.960]
There you go

[02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:16.460]
Or feeding your sickness, also nausea and you see that dress you was wearing, it was positively how luscious

[02:15:16.460 --> 02:15:18.900]
Or like bad food, it could taste how luscious

[02:15:18.900 --> 02:15:20.380]
Wow, this is beautiful

[02:15:21.780 --> 02:15:23.660]
Hazard, think fall boy, like a snore

[02:15:23.660 --> 02:15:25.360]
No, not at all

[02:15:25.700 --> 02:15:29.520]
Hazard, a pig or anyone who behaves like one, either in their eating financial or personal grooming him

[02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:31.840]
Oh yeah, what a hazard, I don't think he's paid them a week

[02:15:31.840 --> 02:15:36.720]
No wonder that hazard went out of business, he kicked all the profits and paid his employees' bookus

[02:15:37.340 --> 02:15:37.980]
Wow, China

[02:15:39.040 --> 02:15:42.600]
Yeah, I'm going to have to start printing more pages

[02:15:43.080 --> 02:15:44.700]
You know, this is getting me in the mood for it

[02:15:44.700 --> 02:15:45.140]
What's that?

[02:15:45.300 --> 02:15:46.260]
Yeah, who fights it?

[02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:49.300]
Oh, coming up soon

[02:15:49.900 --> 02:15:52.360]
Sidirio, I'm going to have to print out the rest of this next 400 pages

[02:15:52.360 --> 02:15:53.380]
Now what was that looking for?

[02:15:53.600 --> 02:15:54.180]
Oh, Getskies

[02:15:54.180 --> 02:15:55.540]
Yes, I can find that

[02:15:55.540 --> 02:15:57.620]
Oh, he worked at those Indian dollars

[02:15:57.620 --> 02:15:58.600]
That would be a Mahaya

[02:15:58.600 --> 02:16:00.180]
That would be a real Mahaya

[02:16:00.860 --> 02:16:02.860]
567 here on All Jew Radio

[02:16:02.860 --> 02:16:04.380]
W-J-A-M

[02:16:04.380 --> 02:16:05.360]
Jam on it

[02:16:05.360 --> 02:16:06.540]
W-Q-A-M

[02:16:06.540 --> 02:16:07.460]
Hello, not there

[02:16:07.460 --> 02:16:10.160]
Sidir, Vizier here and all the other shores and they don't have time to hang on

[02:16:10.160 --> 02:16:11.160]
How dare you?

[02:16:12.280 --> 02:16:15.340]
567-0560, pound 567, they've arrived in Singular, where are the signs?

[02:16:15.580 --> 02:16:18.020]
We got Geldia too in spite of property of demand

[02:16:18.020 --> 02:16:19.400]
W-Q-A-M, hello

[02:16:19.980 --> 02:16:21.480]
Nelson, Roger Solomon, please

[02:16:21.480 --> 02:16:23.420]
Speaking, I'm from Solomon here

[02:16:24.260 --> 02:16:26.160]
Listen, I'm going to speak from highly of it

[02:16:26.160 --> 02:16:29.040]
Check it out, I use Nia dish all the time, I use smear

[02:16:29.780 --> 02:16:32.080]
And I use Getskie and I use

[02:16:32.520 --> 02:16:32.900]
Excellent

[02:16:33.380 --> 02:16:34.180]
Manch and all that

[02:16:34.180 --> 02:16:36.600]
But one thing is the Getskie, I think it's spelled

[02:16:37.640 --> 02:16:39.440]
At the end, SKT

[02:16:39.440 --> 02:16:41.140]
Because I think I've seen it somewhere before

[02:16:41.140 --> 02:16:42.940]
So we've actually seen a Getskie?

[02:16:42.940 --> 02:16:44.900]
Well, I've actually seen it spelled somewhere

[02:16:44.900 --> 02:16:48.660]
And now there's a super-tru movie coming out too, I don't know the name of it

[02:16:48.660 --> 02:16:49.860]
But it's coming out soon

[02:16:50.460 --> 02:16:50.840]
Also

[02:16:50.840 --> 02:16:52.260]
Okay, thanks for having me

[02:16:52.260 --> 02:16:53.300]
I'll be with you as family, alright, now I love you

[02:16:53.300 --> 02:16:53.820]
I'll be with you as well

[02:16:53.820 --> 02:16:57.280]
Okay, let's see, let me look to see if I can find that website

[02:16:57.280 --> 02:16:58.420]
I just had it on here

[02:17:00.040 --> 02:17:02.320]
Do you know what I hate when you have to do that and start all over again?

[02:17:02.480 --> 02:17:02.640]
I do

[02:17:03.180 --> 02:17:07.300]
I even googled the Getskie in the other side, I couldn't find it, I probably spelled it wrong

[02:17:07.300 --> 02:17:08.740]
To open another window instead

[02:17:09.280 --> 02:17:11.980]
No, I'm just going to go back to this thing after the break

[02:17:11.980 --> 02:17:16.220]
560, 560, 0560, you notice that there's no Christian language

[02:17:16.220 --> 02:17:17.200]
Isn't that interesting?

[02:17:17.660 --> 02:17:18.200]
What are you talking about?

[02:17:18.620 --> 02:17:19.660]
Well, what's the Christian language?

[02:17:20.020 --> 02:17:21.660]
American English, I'll have you know

[02:17:21.660 --> 02:17:22.880]
Is the Christian language?

[02:17:23.060 --> 02:17:23.660]
You boy, yeah

[02:17:23.660 --> 02:17:24.600]
Since when?

[02:17:25.100 --> 02:17:26.220]
Since we said so

[02:17:26.740 --> 02:17:29.500]
How I see since Bush got stolen, we're going to convert the world

[02:17:29.500 --> 02:17:31.040]
Excuse me, make them speak Christian

[02:17:31.040 --> 02:17:32.100]
Coming to the QAM, hello

[02:17:32.860 --> 02:17:33.260]
Neil

[02:17:33.260 --> 02:17:34.260]
Yes sir

[02:17:36.120 --> 02:17:38.260]
I have it on my bookshelf and it's on the call

[02:17:38.980 --> 02:17:42.280]
Horacea Yiddish, just thinking that might be a good reference for you

[02:17:42.280 --> 02:17:44.080]
You buy that and tell me the bookshelf

[02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:46.180]
So the other thing is that shit craws me thing

[02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:51.940]
It's almost as good as the rea commercial I heard from the organization last week

[02:17:51.940 --> 02:17:53.500]
To come see Mario Lemieux

[02:17:54.020 --> 02:17:56.100]
Oh yeah, he's a premarital well-deez then

[02:17:56.100 --> 02:17:56.880]
I take nothing

[02:17:57.760 --> 02:17:58.960]
He's not getting any penalties

[02:17:59.400 --> 02:18:02.980]
I'm going to see Sid tonight, but I guess I'm not going to see him on the radio

[02:18:02.980 --> 02:18:04.260]
I mean, that's unbelievable

[02:18:04.260 --> 02:18:06.240]
Help me around, help me up there in the press box

[02:18:06.240 --> 02:18:07.300]
I see him a big way for me

[02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:08.780]
Thanks, pal

[02:18:09.160 --> 02:18:14.020]
Yeah, Mario retired for the 40th time just in case the Panther organization who ever does those promos

[02:18:14.020 --> 02:18:16.460]
Is up to the snuff, is up to whatever

[02:18:16.840 --> 02:18:19.880]
So these are like in alphabetical order now, how am I going to do this?

[02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:21.980]
How the hell does this thing work? I'm back on it

[02:18:22.900 --> 02:18:24.120]
Well, I'm up to the R's

[02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:27.080]
Oh, I can't screw us all on one page then goodness, okay?

[02:18:27.360 --> 02:18:28.860]
All on one page at least online

[02:18:28.860 --> 02:18:30.620]
You know what I mean? You can scroll all the way down

[02:18:30.620 --> 02:18:34.540]
Now let's see, uh, gutten you, OEV, gutten you

[02:18:34.540 --> 02:18:36.700]
Means like good heavens my goodness, Ghana

[02:18:36.700 --> 02:18:38.240]
That's what we're going to do with the night

[02:18:38.240 --> 02:18:42.120]
Got his long johns, this doesn't, I don't think this has got no getchkey

[02:18:42.120 --> 02:18:44.440]
Uh oh, maybe it does, I'll find it

[02:18:44.440 --> 02:18:46.780]
Geshry, give out a good Geshry a screen

[02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:51.680]
Now give a kick, literally give a look, give a kick, glick

[02:18:51.680 --> 02:18:53.260]
Glitch, there's no getchkey in here

[02:18:53.260 --> 02:18:54.460]
Oh, bro, that's bad

[02:18:54.460 --> 02:18:56.020]
He's been leading us down the path

[02:18:58.300 --> 02:19:00.220]
Oh, here's one, give us an affinium

[02:19:00.220 --> 02:19:01.920]
Literally give a dump in the ocean

[02:19:01.920 --> 02:19:03.520]
That's right, I'm just telling Miguel about that

[02:19:03.520 --> 02:19:06.000]
That's my favorite, get cocken off a neon, that's my favorite one

[02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:07.740]
Don't let the joys hear it

[02:19:07.740 --> 02:19:10.420]
Gelt, hey joys, get your oven up a minute

[02:19:10.420 --> 02:19:11.880]
You know, get your oven up a minute, get your oven up already

[02:19:11.880 --> 02:19:15.460]
You're shry, uh, now there's no getchkey on here

[02:19:15.460 --> 02:19:17.820]
What was the other one you wanted with an S, OEV, Schmendrick?

[02:19:18.180 --> 02:19:19.080]
Yes, okay

[02:19:19.080 --> 02:19:25.380]
Now some of these words, uh, I don't want to say that anybody in my family ever made these up

[02:19:25.380 --> 02:19:28.300]
But I think in all Jewish families there were people that made words up

[02:19:28.300 --> 02:19:30.440]
Uh, let's see, here's Lemiel

[02:19:30.440 --> 02:19:32.580]
Yeah, that's too open as Lemiel

[02:19:33.060 --> 02:19:33.500]
Lemiel?

[02:19:33.840 --> 02:19:36.600]
Lemiel, Charlie the guy with the rain cloud always over his head

[02:19:36.600 --> 02:19:38.160]
When the Lemiel spills his soup

[02:19:38.160 --> 02:19:39.100]
I thought that was a slut

[02:19:39.640 --> 02:19:43.080]
When the Lemiel spills his soup, it's the Lemiel spills it on

[02:19:43.080 --> 02:19:44.800]
I heard that, perfect, that's the thing

[02:19:44.800 --> 02:19:45.680]
What am I looking for?

[02:19:46.100 --> 02:19:46.420]
Schmendrick

[02:19:46.420 --> 02:19:47.660]
There's no Schmendrick

[02:19:47.660 --> 02:19:49.300]
Oh, there's Schmaltz

[02:19:49.300 --> 02:19:49.680]
Right?

[02:19:50.240 --> 02:19:50.860]
There's Schmata

[02:19:50.860 --> 02:19:51.620]
Okay

[02:19:52.300 --> 02:19:56.840]
There's Schmeckle, oh, I can't say that, sorry, joys, that means a little, uh, a little member

[02:19:56.840 --> 02:19:57.860]
Oh, here's Schmendrick

[02:19:57.860 --> 02:19:58.420]
Oh, here's Schmendrick

[02:19:58.980 --> 02:20:03.220]
Schmendrick, a pathetic loser, hapless soul, an inept, nimp, nimp, poup, a Schlemiel

[02:20:03.220 --> 02:20:06.500]
We do have a lot of, uh, words for such people

[02:20:06.500 --> 02:20:10.380]
Think of Jerry Lewis doing his lady bit, and you think of Schmendrick?

[02:20:10.620 --> 02:20:10.920]
It says

[02:20:10.920 --> 02:20:12.400]
All right, got it

[02:20:12.840 --> 02:20:15.460]
I've always told you that, Schmendrick and Schlemiel are basically the same

[02:20:15.460 --> 02:20:20.660]
All love goings been changed, like they're in the, uh, SCH is a Schlob, the protected Yiddloch

[02:20:20.660 --> 02:20:26.040]
Okay, listen, 1257 speaking of idiots, then being debated, uh, in the Senate this week

[02:20:26.040 --> 02:20:29.340]
But it would be, but it would be, uh, here's Schmata, and he's out by the way

[02:20:29.340 --> 02:20:31.600]
This is the new Rogers

[02:20:32.660 --> 02:20:35.440]
This is 5'16", QA

[02:20:39.060 --> 02:20:39.940]
It's Stavantutuawe

[02:20:39.940 --> 02:20:40.980]
Hi, V

[02:20:51.960 --> 02:20:54.620]
I'm Schlob, the digital agent, a transformation at Delhi

[02:20:54.620 --> 02:20:59.800]
With my wife and her companions and prince, master, valet, they were stuck at 17 and we had 20-80

[02:20:59.800 --> 02:21:02.440]
I went to Shabaranda, let the baby call, make it away

[02:21:02.440 --> 02:21:07.140]
She handed me the coupons and my beating glasses, I had to remind her where her master is

[02:21:07.140 --> 02:21:12.760]
If it's hanging over the candle, the Mercedes salad, hiding at a door like a mini-hats in the name

[02:21:12.760 --> 02:21:17.540]
She said, well, that's an amazing shit, I be like you, I'm standing here all day, I might think I'm fine

[02:21:17.540 --> 02:21:23.040]
I better get the hall as I record the relay, but say these on your cuney, do I leave my stuff in?

[02:21:23.040 --> 02:21:28.480]
At the ladies of the big and shuffled ginseng, and the big bad little on the hub of a dredd

[02:21:28.480 --> 02:21:34.400]
I only hope that this rate trades, 19 boys, dry face cream makes me scratch, scratch your hoist

[02:21:35.640 --> 02:21:40.860]
I drug my teeth as well to show them the meaning, yeah, we'd better leave before my gun start beating

[02:21:40.860 --> 02:21:45.520]
My wife's in poising on a marriage occasion, and just brought out a train of macaroni and cheese

[02:21:46.040 --> 02:21:51.320]
I said I should be a virus, better pulling apart, they should only expect no one from a died-to-wearing pod

[02:21:51.320 --> 02:21:57.060]
And I might end up a thicc on a fair light beer, as you can go right now, just living here

[02:21:58.760 --> 02:22:04.140]
We know she's a decarbon, she's a dinner full of knowledge, for me to back down in a new picture cup of Irish

[02:22:04.140 --> 02:22:09.160]
She said, my kids, you show me a new place, you snort, I said, try the kitchen and learn how to cook

[02:22:09.160 --> 02:22:13.760]
Not that I should replace, I had enough milk to take home a doggy-bag of triceps

[02:22:20.720 --> 02:22:27.200]
I'm going to go see him again, if he ever gets 60 votes on the poll so far, who should get the permit in two to four thought on a queue

[02:22:27.200 --> 02:22:31.660]
And we write this poll is absolutely pointless, but it kills him good time, and it's better than the Katie Couricraft

[02:22:31.660 --> 02:22:33.740]
I hated that poll, nobody cares about that

[02:22:33.740 --> 02:22:37.600]
Suds call him in 68, he demanded 68, it's a flat footed even in the town

[02:22:37.600 --> 02:22:40.120]
I got 70 to 68, managed in the lead

[02:22:40.120 --> 02:22:41.940]
Oh, well I better refresh then, huh?

[02:22:42.480 --> 02:22:47.520]
Oh yeah, man, it's 7 in a sud 68, that's very rare that you were ahead of me, because your computer's so slow

[02:22:47.520 --> 02:22:48.240]
You're right about that

[02:22:48.240 --> 02:22:55.720]
Poor he's got 45, I won't listen anyway 36, bring back Moe, 31, Curtis 31, the big O, rhymes with Moe, 23

[02:22:55.720 --> 02:23:01.700]
Reverend Jones has got 12, kid Bo Camp or 11, I hit this full nine, the Crow nine, even the Crow is tied with Gellie

[02:23:01.700 --> 02:23:03.940]
Who's slipping down several notches, he's got only nine

[02:23:04.400 --> 02:23:06.620]
He's like the Panthers, he's dropping out a few notches

[02:23:06.620 --> 02:23:11.320]
Joe Zagaki five, Ernie Sociens three, and Lenny Martensweath three, out of 365

[02:23:12.200 --> 02:23:16.780]
This is our second poll, if you missed the Katie Couric poll, they said, we don't want it

[02:23:18.320 --> 02:23:21.480]
5670560, let's get about 45,000 calls in between now and two o'clock

[02:23:21.480 --> 02:23:25.060]
We've reverted it back to that phone baby, we're gonna lean on it and have you the rest of this year

[02:23:25.060 --> 02:23:26.500]
We're leaning on it, aren't we?

[02:23:26.820 --> 02:23:29.440]
And let's hope that the bees these pay the bills so they don't disconnect the phone

[02:23:30.040 --> 02:23:31.080]
Nobody QAAM, hello?

[02:23:31.640 --> 02:23:32.280]
Start near

[02:23:32.280 --> 02:23:33.240]
Yes sir

[02:23:34.060 --> 02:23:37.740]
About those blinds man, I'd rather he just turn to record this one or one of them

[02:23:37.740 --> 02:23:44.460]
Okay, well we'll send you right over 56670560, pound 560 in the Verizon singular wireless line

[02:23:44.460 --> 02:23:45.760]
I guess it must be a lunchtime, huh?

[02:23:46.240 --> 02:23:46.680]
Special

[02:23:47.400 --> 02:23:48.140]
WQAAM, hello?

[02:23:48.720 --> 02:23:53.260]
Hey Neil, this is the grocery store the other day, and how much fruit can you fit in a can?

[02:23:55.260 --> 02:23:55.700]
And...

[02:23:58.800 --> 02:23:59.600]
So much

[02:23:59.600 --> 02:24:01.520]
But turn it man

[02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:03.420]
Deputy QAAM, hello?

[02:24:03.500 --> 02:24:11.900]
Hey Neil, on Tuesday you said melodramatic, but does not make you a hypocrite because you always know dramatic about the radio station

[02:24:12.560 --> 02:24:16.800]
What are you talking about? So what language are you speaking? I said, who is melodramatic?

[02:24:17.100 --> 02:24:22.620]
You, I don't know who you're talking about being melodramatic, but you always know dramatic about the radio station

[02:24:22.620 --> 02:24:23.300]
No, I'm not

[02:24:23.300 --> 02:24:27.920]
Yes, you were just honest about it, I'm not the least that mellow, maybe dramatic but not mellow

[02:24:27.920 --> 02:24:30.980]
No, you're lying man, you complain all the time

[02:24:30.980 --> 02:24:32.620]
Yeah, well don't listen in

[02:24:33.180 --> 02:24:35.780]
But, don't listen, he already started

[02:24:35.780 --> 02:24:37.940]
Yeah, you can't stop, can you?

[02:24:37.940 --> 02:24:38.500]
Why not?

[02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:39.800]
Can't stop

[02:24:39.800 --> 02:24:41.800]
Who said anything about stop?

[02:24:42.320 --> 02:24:43.420]
No, I did, go away

[02:24:44.580 --> 02:24:49.360]
56670560 by the way you're going to be deported once we pass that bill, illegal man, alien, I can tell

[02:24:49.360 --> 02:24:52.920]
I don't know where you're from, I think hunger, but you're going to get deported, hypocrite

[02:24:54.160 --> 02:24:59.040]
5667 melodramatic, maybe we were talking about Lou Dobbs over the top I said, who now what's that talking about?

[02:24:59.340 --> 02:25:03.760]
I just, you know what I was talking about, hypocrite, WMQA, I'm hello

[02:25:04.580 --> 02:25:09.880]
Neil, the other day you said something so true that people, either way you go, the other guy said I was so crap

[02:25:09.880 --> 02:25:11.280]
Well, okay, great, and they love it

[02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:11.840]
What was it?

[02:25:12.380 --> 02:25:13.900]
It's so true about everything

[02:25:13.900 --> 02:25:15.100]
Who loves what?

[02:25:15.560 --> 02:25:20.280]
The people that are getting raped by the government, the gas, the gas oil companies

[02:25:20.280 --> 02:25:23.280]
We all are Americans, we all are Americans, we all are Americans

[02:25:23.980 --> 02:25:27.320]
Tell me how to bend over and when I should do it again

[02:25:27.320 --> 02:25:34.260]
That's all right, and if you put an idea for the police how high those gas gets before people really come out to the streets and complain

[02:25:34.260 --> 02:25:35.380]
I would say

[02:25:35.380 --> 02:25:38.760]
But third man, I get more realistic number

[02:25:38.760 --> 02:25:43.160]
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, don't be a schminderick

[02:25:43.160 --> 02:25:43.520]
No, no

[02:25:44.880 --> 02:25:47.640]
56670560, even the glamour speaking the edition Florida

[02:25:47.640 --> 02:25:51.240]
Now one thing about New York, and you've been in New York City both of you

[02:25:52.020 --> 02:25:53.920]
You've been to Josh Wright, many of you have

[02:25:54.420 --> 02:25:56.780]
Even the glamour in New York speak a lot of you

[02:25:56.780 --> 02:25:58.580]
And that's because there's 3 million Jews there

[02:25:59.040 --> 02:26:02.080]
So if it's like anything else, it's like you notice all the anglos and stuff

[02:26:02.080 --> 02:26:05.360]
Or to speak a lot of Spanish expressions, certain ones

[02:26:05.360 --> 02:26:06.620]
Not certain expressions

[02:26:06.620 --> 02:26:08.200]
And then that was saying that search answer

[02:26:08.200 --> 02:26:08.860]
Like what?

[02:26:09.480 --> 02:26:10.060]
Give me one

[02:26:10.060 --> 02:26:11.720]
Oh, nothing we could say in the air

[02:26:11.720 --> 02:26:12.160]
Oh

[02:26:12.160 --> 02:26:17.580]
But I'm a seriously New York, it's very seldom you can find a Gentile who doesn't understand a lot of you

[02:26:17.580 --> 02:26:19.280]
They've been this because they're surrounded by it

[02:26:19.280 --> 02:26:20.520]
Wouldn't you think that worked?

[02:26:21.100 --> 02:26:21.580]
I'd have heard it

[02:26:22.280 --> 02:26:24.340]
You're crazy man, you're out of your mind

[02:26:24.340 --> 02:26:29.700]
I was going to get in rabbit room on the news that time and it was a fags invaded the studio at CBS and he said the Cosa hoist

[02:26:29.700 --> 02:26:30.300]
Oh yeah

[02:26:30.300 --> 02:26:32.620]
They did right there on the desk, it was pretty embarrassing

[02:26:32.620 --> 02:26:35.400]
You know what Dan used to say, half a loaf is better than

[02:26:35.400 --> 02:26:36.860]
Somebody go away and hello

[02:26:37.360 --> 02:26:39.840]
What do you think about the passing of Jackie McQueen?

[02:26:40.960 --> 02:26:42.000]
Jackie McQueen?

[02:26:42.380 --> 02:26:44.000]
Yeah, the great Jackie McQueen

[02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:45.240]
Who they miss?

[02:26:45.400 --> 02:26:47.480]
They miss the octopus, played with Miles Davis, Charlie Clark

[02:26:47.480 --> 02:26:49.180]
Never heard of Jackie McQueen

[02:26:49.840 --> 02:26:53.640]
Well, you should pay attention to talking about those happy crunners you're selling to

[02:26:53.640 --> 02:26:55.120]
Yeah, such as

[02:26:55.120 --> 02:26:58.160]
Were you talking about Whitney and then the same week from McQueen?

[02:26:58.280 --> 02:27:00.840]
Gene Pitney and Jim Sandhoo, Snapping McQueen?

[02:27:01.780 --> 02:27:02.200]
Who's that?

[02:27:02.380 --> 02:27:04.560]
I hear you, I don't know Snapping McQueen

[02:27:04.560 --> 02:27:06.660]
He's comparing Gene Pitney to this man

[02:27:06.660 --> 02:27:08.520]
You better get your musical taste and order

[02:27:08.520 --> 02:27:10.400]
Okay, there's a Schmendrick for you

[02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:12.300]
There's a Shlamy, Loonish, Lamaazal

[02:27:12.300 --> 02:27:15.640]
He was born under a dark cloud under a bad sign

[02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:19.220]
The troupe of Cobbett is going to come and just nail your ass right to the wall

[02:27:19.220 --> 02:27:19.920]
How do you like that?

[02:27:20.020 --> 02:27:21.280]
Just like a human mazzusa

[02:27:21.280 --> 02:27:23.420]
We're going to nail you to my neighbor's doorframe

[02:27:23.960 --> 02:27:24.280]
Lunatic

[02:27:24.740 --> 02:27:26.620]
Five-six and see I ain't sure how to call his man

[02:27:26.620 --> 02:27:28.100]
It's so much better than all this other stuff

[02:27:28.100 --> 02:27:29.140]
The other stuff is like work

[02:27:29.620 --> 02:27:30.120]
You know?

[02:27:30.260 --> 02:27:31.060]
No, I know, that's why

[02:27:31.060 --> 02:27:31.960]
Can I be spotted there?

[02:27:32.080 --> 02:27:32.840]
I don't want to

[02:27:32.840 --> 02:27:34.080]
I don't want to do that

[02:27:34.080 --> 02:27:35.940]
Just want to sit and take a bunch of idiotic calls

[02:27:35.940 --> 02:27:39.860]
But if the Yankees can win the penitent, do you think the blue jays are going to be a feel of good news

[02:27:39.860 --> 02:27:42.300]
That great new, a referver stadium, but there you have right

[02:27:42.300 --> 02:27:43.320]
The Roger Center

[02:27:43.320 --> 02:27:45.260]
Come to town they name the stadium after me

[02:27:45.260 --> 02:27:46.120]
Damn, God

[02:27:46.120 --> 02:27:46.940]
How you like that?

[02:27:47.320 --> 02:27:47.880]
Lighty white at the

[02:27:47.880 --> 02:27:49.100]
W-Modicone

[02:27:49.100 --> 02:27:50.140]
W-Q-A-M, hello

[02:27:50.140 --> 02:27:50.960]
Are there needle?

[02:27:51.300 --> 02:27:51.800]
Yes sir

[02:27:51.800 --> 02:27:53.180]
Yeah, I got a question for you

[02:27:53.780 --> 02:27:54.920]
What, what are you doing?

[02:27:55.460 --> 02:27:57.180]
Get out with a nonsense, okay?

[02:27:57.420 --> 02:27:58.980]
In your case, just look in the mirror

[02:27:58.980 --> 02:28:00.660]
Okay, that's an answer to the question in your case

[02:28:00.660 --> 02:28:01.680]
What an idiot

[02:28:01.680 --> 02:28:03.500]
Five-six, seven, oh five, sixty

[02:28:03.920 --> 02:28:04.800]
Count five, sixty

[02:28:04.800 --> 02:28:08.100]
In fact, there are a lot of people out there who would say you're the post-to-child

[02:28:08.560 --> 02:28:09.640]
W-Q-A-M, hello

[02:28:10.080 --> 02:28:10.720]
Yes sir

[02:28:10.720 --> 02:28:12.740]
I always see Anglos using the phrase

[02:28:12.740 --> 02:28:13.540]
Lighty-Cone

[02:28:13.540 --> 02:28:14.960]
Yeah, it's out of Florida

[02:28:14.960 --> 02:28:16.340]
No, that's because they listen to the show

[02:28:16.820 --> 02:28:17.520]
Oh, okay

[02:28:17.520 --> 02:28:19.420]
And they hear punks like you are using it

[02:28:20.200 --> 02:28:20.520]
Yeah

[02:28:20.520 --> 02:28:21.740]
Or maybe they're just

[02:28:21.740 --> 02:28:22.700]
Maybe that's it

[02:28:22.700 --> 02:28:25.940]
Five-six, seven, oh five, sixty, see what I mean by one track mind, that's it

[02:28:25.940 --> 02:28:26.540]
That's your people

[02:28:26.540 --> 02:28:27.420]
That's all they know from

[02:28:27.420 --> 02:28:29.920]
It's my bone, bull, and that's pretty much an alienito

[02:28:29.920 --> 02:28:31.900]
Alienito, come and come and eat that, come and eat that

[02:28:32.960 --> 02:28:34.540]
There's the top four right there I think

[02:28:34.540 --> 02:28:35.880]
I think I just touched all the bases

[02:28:35.880 --> 02:28:37.660]
From first base all the way to home plate

[02:28:38.020 --> 02:28:40.660]
Just circle the bases and touch the home

[02:28:40.660 --> 02:28:42.180]
All you ask for is to touch it at home

[02:28:42.180 --> 02:28:43.340]
How many hosts we got?

[02:28:43.380 --> 02:28:44.220]
And then we have 400 yet?

[02:28:44.880 --> 02:28:47.220]
393, we're closing it on 400 on the new pool

[02:28:47.220 --> 02:28:49.180]
Boy, we have to do this a lot more

[02:28:49.180 --> 02:28:51.500]
Because when we move the first pool on it gets really stale

[02:28:51.500 --> 02:28:52.820]
And I don't know why that, but this is Eric

[02:28:52.820 --> 02:28:55.040]
You know, a little less time to eat

[02:28:55.460 --> 02:28:57.900]
Although he got, he whipped this baby on there in a heartbeat

[02:28:57.900 --> 02:28:59.400]
Boy, he got to it real fast

[02:28:59.400 --> 02:29:01.120]
See, one thing about Eric, as you well know

[02:29:01.120 --> 02:29:02.440]
If you like, rip him just a little bit

[02:29:02.440 --> 02:29:03.980]
All of a sudden he hops too

[02:29:03.980 --> 02:29:04.980]
Remember hops, sir?

[02:29:05.540 --> 02:29:05.900]
Yes, I do

[02:29:05.900 --> 02:29:08.200]
Well, Eric, he eats a lot in the hops too

[02:29:08.200 --> 02:29:08.720]
Does he say?

[02:29:09.100 --> 02:29:09.840]
I don't know yet

[02:29:09.840 --> 02:29:10.800]
Maybe like, yeah, who fights?

[02:29:10.900 --> 02:29:11.300]
I fight you

[02:29:11.740 --> 02:29:13.120]
Gotta be careful with that one

[02:29:13.120 --> 02:29:13.520]
Right, ho

[02:29:14.260 --> 02:29:14.820]
WQIAM, hello

[02:29:14.820 --> 02:29:16.480]
Could I be a magician, please?

[02:29:16.680 --> 02:29:18.520]
Yeah, you sure could, WQIAM, hello

[02:29:19.980 --> 02:29:20.620]
Alien America

[02:29:22.940 --> 02:29:23.580]
Fielangamapar Suratila

[02:29:38.940 --> 02:29:53.560]
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[02:29:55.940 --> 02:29:57.780]
We'd like to ride you up there Qainem. Hello

[02:30:02.840 --> 02:30:07.940]
See I never knew what was happening before, but now I know I'm enjoying it even more WK pa m hello

[02:30:07.940 --> 02:30:10.080]
Hey Niel, I don't know about the slot of you

[02:30:10.080 --> 02:30:14.220]
But they're the only ways that gonna make money when you retire is to put on the net $0.00

[02:30:14.220 --> 02:30:14.620]
It really?

[02:30:16.640 --> 02:30:16.960]
processing

[02:30:17.320 --> 02:30:20.380]
Okay, I'll ask him when the joke comes back from the West Coast

[02:30:20.380 --> 02:30:21.620]
They donít play no tapes

[02:30:21.620 --> 02:30:26.560]
Those tapes were so bad. I especially like the one about Alien and the Pope that was my favorite. They still play that.

[02:30:27.020 --> 02:30:30.520]
And of course that check better show up on Monday on the 10th.

[02:30:30.840 --> 02:30:38.120]
And his clearance assures me that it will because if not and you're going to be on vacation, it's going to either be Alien and the Pope or Josh doing a show solo.

[02:30:38.500 --> 02:30:40.880]
You've heard of Napoleon's solo. It's going to be Josh solo.

[02:30:41.180 --> 02:30:42.640]
It'll be Josh. You're going to do a show, aren't you?

[02:30:43.020 --> 02:30:45.100]
Four hours. Oh, four hours. It's a long time.

[02:30:45.300 --> 02:30:46.960]
It'll be a lot of music in four hours. Say yeah.

[02:30:46.980 --> 02:30:47.740]
Good on you. Oh, sure.

[02:30:48.180 --> 02:30:50.300]
What? No, I'm talking about all phone calls.

[02:30:50.300 --> 02:30:55.340]
Oh, yeah. You got a lot of calls. You got a lot of friends out there and ready to land. I think we have one call before.

[02:30:55.680 --> 02:30:58.700]
You seen that picture and he's ready to rock and roll. Oh, yeah.

[02:30:58.960 --> 02:30:59.660]
He'll be calling a lot.

[02:31:00.280 --> 02:31:03.660]
406 votes on the pool. Who should get the permanent two to four spot on the quim?

[02:31:03.960 --> 02:31:06.900]
Magog 75, Sud 74. We got a real battle going on there.

[02:31:07.320 --> 02:31:09.380]
What's the point? Did we look up Gornish, Telfin?

[02:31:09.760 --> 02:31:13.800]
George Rodriguez 54. I won't listen anyway. 42. Bring back Moe with 37.

[02:31:14.200 --> 02:31:17.860]
Rams with no chance. Curtis 33. The big old 26.

[02:31:17.860 --> 02:31:20.800]
Reverend Jones 12. Bring him on here so we can kill him and his boyfriend.

[02:31:21.260 --> 02:31:24.240]
Kim Bocamp or 12. Gelly's got 11. He's really moving up now.

[02:31:24.460 --> 02:31:26.360]
He was stuck on Yine for the longest time.

[02:31:26.540 --> 02:31:28.940]
You know what? Now Gelly has moved barely ahead of the crew.

[02:31:29.240 --> 02:31:30.480]
Gelly would live in the crew with 10.

[02:31:31.160 --> 02:31:31.880]
Kennis Masamacho.

[02:31:32.420 --> 02:31:33.540]
I hate this pool nine.

[02:31:34.020 --> 02:31:36.700]
Joseph Gaki five. Ernie Soach and three and Lini Martez.

[02:31:37.320 --> 02:31:39.440]
Sultimentate trace. See there you go. What I eat is she again?

[02:31:40.280 --> 02:31:42.760]
There's that Scott McCullough, but a beep but a move touches on.

[02:31:42.960 --> 02:31:44.900]
Now, touch this. 12 minutes after one.

[02:31:44.900 --> 02:31:47.180]
Oh my God. Gelly from the Bank Atlantic Yanta Center.

[02:31:47.180 --> 02:31:49.380]
We're to a clock. Well, we're sure we're working on pregame.

[02:31:49.500 --> 02:31:52.360]
I don't understand it. And then Mad Dogs at the Masters.

[02:31:52.360 --> 02:31:55.160]
Now, I've got it for and Curtis is at the Yanta Center along with it.

[02:31:55.300 --> 02:31:58.320]
I guess they're going to be confagulating back and forth side by each, right?

[02:31:58.620 --> 02:31:58.820]
Right.

[02:31:59.260 --> 02:32:03.440]
Now, soon because we got the baseball game on QAIM and a hockey game on 1360.

[02:32:03.440 --> 02:32:07.020]
And we're like, who's on first? And any Kien Vegas playing his brains out.

[02:32:07.300 --> 02:32:08.240]
Follows all of those.

[02:32:09.320 --> 02:32:12.780]
Speaking of things, if you have termites in your home or maybe you think you have them,

[02:32:12.780 --> 02:32:16.020]

[02:32:32.400 --> 02:32:34.900]
Of course, when you put that tent up, everybody in the hood is looking and saying,

[02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:36.680]
oh my God, can you imagine what's going on in there?

[02:34:28.900 --> 02:34:34.660]
The reasons why 24 rules and the soprano sucks first.

[02:34:35.100 --> 02:34:37.560]
Jack Bauer incriminates and interrogates witnesses.

[02:34:37.960 --> 02:34:40.020]
This is the last question you've got to talk to me about grandad.

[02:34:40.160 --> 02:34:43.180]
While Tony soprano eats Chinese food with his wife.

[02:34:43.340 --> 02:34:48.100]
I don't know about you, but ever since we found this place I catch myself panting with my fingers.

[02:34:48.700 --> 02:34:50.780]
Me too. Sometimes you're set.

[02:34:51.160 --> 02:34:54.200]
Jack Bauer abducts witnesses and threatens to kill them.

[02:34:54.460 --> 02:34:57.000]
Make a sound and I will throw your brains out all over the windshield.

[02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.600]
Wow, Vito talks about his workout routine.

[02:34:59.940 --> 02:35:01.400]
Five minutes and no incline.

[02:35:01.980 --> 02:35:04.720]
Then I switch to full uphill for my cardio.

[02:35:04.940 --> 02:35:09.120]
Jack Bauer worries about the most important vehicle in the United States.

[02:35:09.300 --> 02:35:10.320]
What's the airport for Japan?

[02:35:11.460 --> 02:35:12.940]
What's the airport for Japan?

[02:35:13.220 --> 02:35:15.840]
While the sopranos shills the Porsche Cayenne.

[02:35:16.200 --> 02:35:17.260]
Is this the new Porsche?

[02:35:17.820 --> 02:35:20.860]
Cayenne Turbo. I got the 4.5-0.8.

[02:35:21.140 --> 02:35:22.740]
Look at your about the color-soy ticket shot.

[02:35:22.740 --> 02:35:25.520]
How many I love it? It's gorgeous.

[02:35:26.060 --> 02:35:26.820]
What a car!

[02:35:27.380 --> 02:35:28.800]
Jack Bauer gets pissed.

[02:35:29.020 --> 02:35:29.440]
Damn it!

[02:35:29.800 --> 02:35:32.260]
While Tony soprano goes to his shrink.

[02:35:32.500 --> 02:35:34.620]
You try to smother your mother with a pillow.

[02:35:34.980 --> 02:35:38.340]
I'd grab the pillow, but just to keep my hands occupied.

[02:35:38.660 --> 02:35:46.140]
And these are just a few of the reasons why 24 rules and the sopranos sucks at least lately.

[02:35:46.760 --> 02:35:48.840]
Well, look at this. Here's a thing on his booby-gram.

[02:35:48.940 --> 02:35:50.660]
I just discovered I was poxicking around with it.

[02:35:50.800 --> 02:35:51.400]
Oh, there's another one.

[02:35:52.020 --> 02:35:55.000]
Click here to open the entire dictionary sorted by English.

[02:35:55.420 --> 02:35:56.660]
So that's what I wanted to do.

[02:35:57.340 --> 02:35:58.060]
Now listen to me.

[02:35:58.540 --> 02:35:59.840]
Go to this side and you click it.

[02:35:59.920 --> 02:36:01.400]
Oh, there's the Torah.

[02:36:01.920 --> 02:36:02.320]
Cayenne Hora.

[02:36:02.900 --> 02:36:04.020]
Sorted by Yiddish.

[02:36:04.260 --> 02:36:05.400]
Okay. So here's the whole...

[02:36:06.240 --> 02:36:08.040]
Oh my god, this is incredible.

[02:36:08.520 --> 02:36:09.500]
So what was I looking for?

[02:36:09.620 --> 02:36:09.960]
Getski.

[02:36:12.400 --> 02:36:12.760]
Brother.

[02:36:13.420 --> 02:36:13.920]
Oh, I see.

[02:36:14.160 --> 02:36:15.200]
Oh, that's it. It's too complicated.

[02:36:15.200 --> 02:36:16.820]
But I'll find it. Trust me. I'll find it.

[02:36:17.100 --> 02:36:18.560]
And then when we find it, what do I get to do with it?

[02:36:19.140 --> 02:36:21.180]
I think the Getski's all need to be sent in outer space.

[02:36:21.180 --> 02:36:21.940]
In the Uranus.

[02:36:22.300 --> 02:36:23.400]
118 and 560.

[02:36:23.540 --> 02:36:27.820]
WDQ, by the way, there's Scott McCullen trying to lie his way through this thing about the new leaker-in-chief.

[02:36:28.240 --> 02:36:30.280]
But it moved, but it moved, but it popped while they were on-classified.

[02:36:30.620 --> 02:36:32.100]
Yeah, well, he's the one I made him on-classified.

[02:36:32.420 --> 02:36:34.260]
He declassified so we could smear and smear.

[02:36:34.600 --> 02:36:37.080]
See, the hell with national security, let's just smear and smear.

[02:36:37.360 --> 02:36:40.400]
Anybody who out dares, who has the audacity,

[02:36:40.680 --> 02:36:43.880]
and Stern would say, how dare you to question their veracity.

[02:36:44.600 --> 02:36:45.480]
Somebody QYM, hello?

[02:36:46.320 --> 02:36:47.200]
Daniel, how's it going?

[02:36:47.640 --> 02:36:47.960]
All right.

[02:36:48.360 --> 02:36:49.940]
I got a radio question for you.

[02:36:49.940 --> 02:36:53.340]
I think it'd be the best to pull the rod when the original show blows.

[02:36:53.860 --> 02:36:54.340]
Good point.

[02:36:54.580 --> 02:36:55.420]
Okay, why they on vacation?

[02:36:56.400 --> 02:36:58.920]
He's always sick that line, even that line, you know,

[02:36:59.200 --> 02:37:00.500]
lately as a duplicator.

[02:37:00.960 --> 02:37:01.280]
No, okay.

[02:37:02.800 --> 02:37:05.960]
5667-0560, 0.560 in the Verizon and Singular wireless line.

[02:37:06.120 --> 02:37:07.360]
Anybody care about pulling an old rod?

[02:37:07.460 --> 02:37:08.220]
No, not really.

[02:37:08.840 --> 02:37:09.780]
WDQ, by M, hello?

[02:37:10.280 --> 02:37:11.060]
I'll go near a hello.

[02:37:11.300 --> 02:37:11.880]
Yes, sir.

[02:37:12.200 --> 02:37:12.980]
How are you, sir?

[02:37:13.060 --> 02:37:13.360]
Excellent.

[02:37:13.900 --> 02:37:14.360]
I'm glad.

[02:37:15.040 --> 02:37:15.700]
Happy New Year.

[02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:16.520]
Happy New Year.

[02:37:16.520 --> 02:37:17.360]
Hey, sir.

[02:37:17.360 --> 02:37:17.600]
Hello.

[02:37:17.980 --> 02:37:20.400]
Wilson, George, you'll definitely appreciate this one.

[02:37:20.940 --> 02:37:22.280]
Neil, you have to hear this, no wife.

[02:37:22.540 --> 02:37:23.600]
Just put a recon in your voice.

[02:37:23.720 --> 02:37:26.140]
My favorite, the English word is Gakas.

[02:37:27.100 --> 02:37:29.520]
And with that being said, with the pro-politics,

[02:37:30.260 --> 02:37:32.680]
our government and Joker, a president for a call on that,

[02:37:33.320 --> 02:37:38.000]
and seems like the Joker management and your operation over there,

[02:37:38.640 --> 02:37:41.480]
those who show you ails coming all shapes, sizes, and colors.

[02:37:41.760 --> 02:37:42.520]
And they're all for me.

[02:37:45.400 --> 02:37:46.280]
That was great.

[02:37:46.500 --> 02:37:48.860]
It was doing very poorly until you got right to the end of the word.

[02:37:48.860 --> 02:37:49.740]
Is that word he threw out there?

[02:37:50.020 --> 02:37:50.840]
I have no idea.

[02:37:51.060 --> 02:37:51.360]
Knockers?

[02:37:51.680 --> 02:37:52.680]
No, and I know knockers.

[02:37:53.340 --> 02:37:53.660]
Knockers?

[02:37:54.040 --> 02:37:55.120]
Yeah, knockers, I think.

[02:37:55.760 --> 02:37:57.340]
Which is like Polish knock-wurst.

[02:37:57.520 --> 02:37:58.360]
I don't like knock-wurst.

[02:37:58.460 --> 02:37:59.600]
I don't like bakwurst or knock-wurst.

[02:37:59.720 --> 02:38:00.400]
Brawurst, I love.

[02:38:00.760 --> 02:38:01.680]
Knock-wurst, I can live without.

[02:38:02.080 --> 02:38:03.280]
You better learn your German sausage.

[02:38:03.460 --> 02:38:04.240]
What about liverwurst?

[02:38:04.420 --> 02:38:05.740]
What about liverwurst?

[02:38:06.100 --> 02:38:08.300]
Ooh, you don't eat that to you.

[02:38:08.420 --> 02:38:08.600]
I hope.

[02:38:09.080 --> 02:38:09.580]
Well, think I do.

[02:38:09.860 --> 02:38:10.860]
It's like eating chicken livers.

[02:38:11.080 --> 02:38:11.400]
Oh, man.

[02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:29.360]
I don't know.

[02:38:29.380 --> 02:38:29.380]

[02:38:29.400 --> 02:38:29.420]
I don't know.

[02:38:29.420 --> 02:38:29.420]

[02:38:29.420 --> 02:38:29.420]

[02:38:29.420 --> 02:38:29.420]

[02:38:29.420 --> 02:38:29.420]

[02:38:29.420 --> 02:38:29.420]

[02:38:29.420 --> 02:38:29.720]
I don't know.

[02:38:30.240 --> 02:38:31.240]
I don't know.

[02:38:31.240 --> 02:38:31.280]
I don't know.

[02:38:31.280 --> 02:38:31.280]

[02:38:31.280 --> 02:38:31.300]
I don't know.

[02:38:31.300 --> 02:38:31.300]

[02:38:31.300 --> 02:38:31.520]
I don't know.

[02:38:32.080 --> 02:38:32.860]
I don't know.

[02:38:32.860 --> 02:38:32.860]

[02:38:32.860 --> 02:38:33.580]
I don't know.

[02:38:35.060 --> 02:38:35.540]
I don't know.

[02:38:35.540 --> 02:38:36.760]
I don't know.

[02:38:36.860 --> 02:38:37.240]
I don't know.

[02:38:37.240 --> 02:38:37.240]

[02:38:37.240 --> 02:38:37.240]

[02:38:37.240 --> 02:38:37.460]
I don't know.

[02:38:37.460 --> 02:38:37.860]
I don't know.

[02:38:37.860 --> 02:38:38.600]
I don't know.

[02:38:38.720 --> 02:38:40.800]
I don't know.

[02:38:40.940 --> 02:38:40.940]

[02:38:40.940 --> 02:38:41.380]
I don't know.

[02:38:47.020 --> 02:38:57.240]
I don't know.

[02:38:58.900 --> 02:38:59.560]
I don't know.

[02:38:59.880 --> 02:39:00.280]
I don't know.

[02:39:00.660 --> 02:39:00.660]

[02:39:00.740 --> 02:39:01.100]
I don't know.

[02:39:01.100 --> 02:39:01.800]
I don't know.

[02:39:02.220 --> 02:39:03.440]
I don't know.

[02:39:03.820 --> 02:39:04.240]
I don't know.

[02:39:04.580 --> 02:39:05.560]
I don't know.

[02:39:05.560 --> 02:39:06.520]
I don't know.

[02:39:06.920 --> 02:39:06.980]
I don't know.

[02:39:06.980 --> 02:39:08.140]
I don't know.

[02:39:08.200 --> 02:39:08.360]
I don't know.

[02:39:08.360 --> 02:39:08.600]
I don't know.

[02:39:08.600 --> 02:39:08.600]

[02:39:08.600 --> 02:39:08.600]

[02:39:08.600 --> 02:39:08.600]

[02:39:08.600 --> 02:39:08.840]
I don't know.

[02:39:08.840 --> 02:39:08.840]

[02:39:08.840 --> 02:39:08.840]

[02:39:08.840 --> 02:39:08.840]

[02:39:08.840 --> 02:39:08.840]

[02:39:08.840 --> 02:39:08.840]

[02:39:08.840 --> 02:39:08.840]

[02:39:08.840 --> 02:39:08.840]

[02:39:08.840 --> 02:39:09.500]
I don't know.

[02:39:09.500 --> 02:39:09.860]
I don't know.

[02:39:09.860 --> 02:39:11.100]
I don't know.

[02:39:11.100 --> 02:39:11.360]
I don't know.

[02:39:11.360 --> 02:39:14.500]
But I think about the macaroni and cheese and cheese on Friday, that somebody asked about

[02:39:14.500 --> 02:39:15.460]
was yesterday or Wednesday.

[02:39:15.860 --> 02:39:15.940]
Right.

[02:39:16.040 --> 02:39:16.860]
And we were talking about that.

[02:39:16.880 --> 02:39:17.020]
Right.

[02:39:17.520 --> 02:39:20.140]
And of course I looked it up and then we all said the same thing.

[02:39:20.140 --> 02:39:22.640]
They just changed it as they go along and they make it up as they go along.

[02:39:22.740 --> 02:39:23.960]
And the same thing with this now.

[02:39:24.560 --> 02:39:26.500]
All these years, man, with our Judas is scary.

[02:39:26.640 --> 02:39:27.480]
He was the turncoat.

[02:39:27.560 --> 02:39:28.700]
He was the backstabber.

[02:39:29.040 --> 02:39:32.200]
He was kind of like the Mohawar David of ancient times.

[02:39:32.460 --> 02:39:33.160]
Now coming to fight on.

[02:39:33.220 --> 02:39:33.900]
He was a good guy.

[02:39:33.920 --> 02:39:37.580]
He was just kind of letting the heaven hand, you know, for Jesus.

[02:39:38.080 --> 02:39:41.120]
I mean, Jesus could have gone and turned himself in and said, Here, nail me up there.

[02:39:41.120 --> 02:39:42.060]
So we can get this thing over.

[02:39:42.200 --> 02:39:44.640]
We're going to get me out of this awful body and he's damned sandals.

[02:39:44.940 --> 02:39:45.640]
But no, he didn't do that.

[02:39:45.740 --> 02:39:47.400]
He had to have somebody, he had to have an enabler.

[02:39:47.680 --> 02:39:48.880]
Somebody who could be a hated.

[02:39:49.180 --> 02:39:50.340]
And he had a quarter of this deal.

[02:39:50.340 --> 02:39:55.780]
And I told him that for generations to come, he'll be despised and reviled until they find this particular tablet.

[02:39:56.020 --> 02:39:56.500]
I told him what a good deal.

[02:39:56.980 --> 02:39:58.100]
And Meg green found that tablet.

[02:39:58.100 --> 02:40:01.160]
And every time she says, Oh, we kept falling out just like that change.

[02:40:01.680 --> 02:40:02.320]
Meg green on money.

[02:40:02.420 --> 02:40:03.380]
Do we still have that?

[02:40:03.900 --> 02:40:05.620]
I think I have it on a cart over here.

[02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:06.580]
Get out of here.

[02:40:06.880 --> 02:40:07.080]
All right.

[02:40:07.600 --> 02:40:08.180]
Do you really?

[02:40:08.380 --> 02:40:09.440]
Well, I don't want you to play it.

[02:40:09.480 --> 02:40:10.080]
It's disgusting.

[02:40:10.520 --> 02:40:13.620]
Meg keeps standing up and every time she falls, she stands up.

[02:40:13.700 --> 02:40:14.920]
All the change keeps falling out.

[02:40:15.720 --> 02:40:17.460]
Although we do have, tell you one thing we have about Meg.

[02:40:17.680 --> 02:40:19.620]
Don't don't even waste your time looking for it.

[02:40:19.720 --> 02:40:20.060]
Too late.

[02:40:20.480 --> 02:40:20.700]
Huh?

[02:40:21.020 --> 02:40:21.280]
Hello.

[02:40:21.860 --> 02:40:23.860]
Randy, I don't hate you at all.

[02:40:24.320 --> 02:40:24.720]
Congratulations.

[02:40:25.340 --> 02:40:26.660]
Get out of here, Meg.

[02:40:27.160 --> 02:40:30.080]
You want to know something truthfully, I'm happy for you.

[02:40:30.160 --> 02:40:31.500]
Why are you happy for me?

[02:40:31.720 --> 02:40:33.720]
Because I am going to my boat.

[02:40:33.920 --> 02:40:35.140]
We're going out for a cruise.

[02:40:35.360 --> 02:40:36.820]
I'm having for the four and a half years.

[02:40:36.840 --> 02:40:38.360]
My first weekend's off.

[02:40:38.360 --> 02:40:40.040]
I'm promoting my video.

[02:40:40.160 --> 02:40:41.160]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[02:40:41.160 --> 02:40:43.120]
I figured it was some kind of promotion thing.

[02:40:43.240 --> 02:40:44.220]
No, no, no, not at all.

[02:40:44.320 --> 02:40:46.820]
I'm just saying that I welcome you to the station.

[02:40:47.040 --> 02:40:48.100]
Honestly, God, I do.

[02:40:48.240 --> 02:40:48.640]
Really?

[02:40:48.940 --> 02:40:49.440]
Trust me.

[02:40:49.680 --> 02:40:50.280]
I'm not lying.

[02:40:50.500 --> 02:40:52.260]
I call to congratulate you.

[02:40:52.320 --> 02:40:56.000]
Well, Meg, I just, can I just ask you one-lousy question there?

[02:40:56.460 --> 02:40:57.740]
Why on your last show?

[02:40:57.920 --> 02:41:01.540]
Did you say I didn't have a chance in hell of doing anything over here at WIID?

[02:41:01.740 --> 02:41:02.480]
I made a mistake.

[02:41:02.700 --> 02:41:03.380]
I made a bad call.

[02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:05.100]
So you have something to do.

[02:41:05.280 --> 02:41:06.480]
And I think you're fun.

[02:41:06.480 --> 02:41:10.180]
And I think it's perfectly okay to have, relax and have fun on a weekend.

[02:41:10.380 --> 02:41:12.120]
Honestly, God, I need it too.

[02:41:12.320 --> 02:41:12.520]
Yeah.

[02:41:12.640 --> 02:41:14.900]
And I'm enjoying listening to you.

[02:41:15.080 --> 02:41:16.200]
And it's no full.

[02:41:17.020 --> 02:41:18.440]
Now, have a good day.

[02:41:18.680 --> 02:41:18.700]
Have a good day.

[02:41:18.700 --> 02:41:19.060]
See you.

[02:41:19.320 --> 02:41:20.560]
Don't believe the word of it, man.

[02:41:20.700 --> 02:41:22.660]
Stay here and trash me for an all afternoon.

[02:41:23.440 --> 02:41:24.200]
A whole afternoon.

[02:41:24.340 --> 02:41:26.000]
Stay here and say I didn't have a chance in hell.

[02:41:26.160 --> 02:41:26.740]
I had no talent.

[02:41:26.840 --> 02:41:27.980]
What the hell was I doing here?

[02:41:28.280 --> 02:41:29.600]
Boy, Gary made a big mistake.

[02:41:29.960 --> 02:41:32.360]
Now she wants to promote something at our tailgate party.

[02:41:32.360 --> 02:41:33.520]
So she's going to kiss a little butt.

[02:41:34.080 --> 02:41:34.720]
Back to him.

[02:41:34.880 --> 02:41:35.300]
There you go.

[02:41:35.420 --> 02:41:37.820]
I never done it my life.

[02:41:39.120 --> 02:41:40.020]
That's all I got for you.

[02:41:40.460 --> 02:41:40.960]
That's all we got.

[02:41:41.120 --> 02:41:41.400]
That's enough.

[02:41:41.560 --> 02:41:42.400]
That's enough, Meg Green.

[02:41:42.660 --> 02:41:44.320]
Nobody knows from this Meg Green at this point.

[02:41:44.640 --> 02:41:44.640]

[02:41:44.840 --> 02:41:45.860]
I drove by your office yesterday.

[02:41:46.220 --> 02:41:46.680]
In fact, huh?

[02:41:46.920 --> 02:41:47.940]
I drove by your office yesterday.

[02:41:48.260 --> 02:41:48.760]
Her orifice?

[02:41:49.020 --> 02:41:49.480]
Yes, I did.

[02:41:49.720 --> 02:41:50.440]
Where is her orifice?

[02:41:50.880 --> 02:41:51.920]
She's got a big one right over here.

[02:41:51.960 --> 02:41:52.320]
I was very.

[02:41:53.340 --> 02:41:54.580]
Yeah, I heard she's got a big one.

[02:41:54.820 --> 02:41:55.320]
Oh, she was.

[02:41:55.540 --> 02:41:57.140]
I'll tell you who was very popular in those days.

[02:41:57.140 --> 02:41:58.900]
And I would do is the plant guy on Sunday morning.

[02:41:59.280 --> 02:42:00.180]
He was actually.

[02:42:00.300 --> 02:42:01.620]
I'm not joking about that either.

[02:42:01.820 --> 02:42:03.500]
I mean, you know that the audience probably thought

[02:42:03.500 --> 02:42:04.140]
that's something since the joke.

[02:42:04.300 --> 02:42:05.240]
You could even open wide.

[02:42:05.620 --> 02:42:06.140]
What was his name?

[02:42:06.440 --> 02:42:06.940]
Chris Rollins.

[02:42:07.200 --> 02:42:08.520]
Chris Rollins, man, the plant guy,

[02:42:08.560 --> 02:42:09.840]
it affords you to ring off the hook.

[02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:10.600]
That was the other day.

[02:42:10.720 --> 02:42:11.260]
Brother to Henry Rollins.

[02:42:11.440 --> 02:42:12.640]
Those phones were some moken.

[02:42:13.140 --> 02:42:14.560]
And so are more of his colors, I think.

[02:42:15.020 --> 02:42:15.740]
You know that's the kind of,

[02:42:15.740 --> 02:42:17.200]
that's the kind of gardening they were talking about.

[02:42:17.420 --> 02:42:17.580]
That's right.

[02:42:17.960 --> 02:42:18.700]
70 QAM.

[02:42:18.900 --> 02:42:19.480]
QAM, hello.

[02:42:19.880 --> 02:42:20.100]
Neil.

[02:42:20.580 --> 02:42:20.960]
Yes, sir.

[02:42:21.320 --> 02:42:22.960]
Just wanted to get George a chronic home.

[02:42:25.120 --> 02:42:25.640]
How good?

[02:42:25.960 --> 02:42:26.940]
70 QAM, hello.

[02:42:27.740 --> 02:42:28.700]
Neil, how's it going?

[02:42:28.860 --> 02:42:29.860]
I'm a former Catholic.

[02:42:30.400 --> 02:42:30.620]
Yeah.

[02:42:30.980 --> 02:42:31.340]
Congratulations.

[02:42:31.880 --> 02:42:34.640]
I want to go see my money last night so I can front her

[02:42:34.640 --> 02:42:35.700]
with an affinuous thing.

[02:42:35.780 --> 02:42:38.460]
I was like, why did you make me eat that crap every Friday and Wednesday?

[02:42:39.200 --> 02:42:40.900]
You're really going to tell her the answer, but you know what she said?

[02:42:40.940 --> 02:42:42.220]
It was good for the fishing industry.

[02:42:42.700 --> 02:42:43.300]
Yeah, that's true.

[02:42:43.380 --> 02:42:43.920]
That's a good point.

[02:42:44.200 --> 02:42:44.800]
I mean, that's it.

[02:42:44.940 --> 02:42:46.260]
I mean, she really couldn't say anything.

[02:42:46.280 --> 02:42:49.300]
That's what I sewer asked because you probably got like mercury in your system now from eating

[02:42:49.300 --> 02:42:50.320]
all that fish toys a week.

[02:42:50.400 --> 02:42:52.540]
So I sewer asked her for parental malpractice.

[02:42:52.780 --> 02:42:57.040]
And when he had something else too, I was trying to contact my old buddies being an internet.

[02:42:57.380 --> 02:43:00.440]
I grew up in New York and I ran into one guy and I said, hey, how you been?

[02:43:00.440 --> 02:43:01.860]
He was like, I don't want to talk to you.

[02:43:01.960 --> 02:43:02.920]
He brings up bad memories.

[02:43:03.160 --> 02:43:04.160]
I'm like, what are you talking about?

[02:43:04.340 --> 02:43:04.880]
Can we get home?

[02:43:05.020 --> 02:43:05.680]
We played ball.

[02:43:06.060 --> 02:43:07.100]
And then I put it together.

[02:43:07.200 --> 02:43:08.100]
He was an altar boy.

[02:43:08.460 --> 02:43:08.960]
Uh-huh.

[02:43:09.460 --> 02:43:10.580]
And that's what's bad to me.

[02:43:10.620 --> 02:43:11.380]
He didn't want to say it.

[02:43:11.440 --> 02:43:13.320]
But the Eminence Reeve brothers boy, I'll tell you.

[02:43:13.380 --> 02:43:14.420]
They were in the rectory.

[02:43:14.800 --> 02:43:14.800]

[02:43:15.740 --> 02:43:19.220]
I'm a Catholic.

[02:43:19.840 --> 02:43:20.580]
I'm not a Catholic.

[02:43:20.860 --> 02:43:21.080]
Bye.

[02:43:21.480 --> 02:43:21.660]
Bye.

[02:43:24.340 --> 02:43:25.460]
Well, maybe he was ugly.

[02:43:25.620 --> 02:43:25.940]
I never know.

[02:43:26.880 --> 02:43:27.340]
26th after one.

[02:43:27.380 --> 02:43:28.400]
I guess that's the barometer.

[02:43:28.580 --> 02:43:28.740]
Okay.

[02:43:28.880 --> 02:43:30.420]
Either that's the father had very bad eyes.

[02:43:30.420 --> 02:43:30.420]

[02:43:30.420 --> 02:43:30.420]

[02:43:30.420 --> 02:43:30.420]

[02:43:30.420 --> 02:43:34.040]
I said, maybe if you were ugly when you were an altar boy, they didn't touch your goods.

[02:43:34.900 --> 02:43:35.740]
Or your bads.

[02:43:35.980 --> 02:43:36.820]
Or maybe they were just busy.

[02:43:36.960 --> 02:43:38.260]
Maybe they had so many others lined up.

[02:43:38.420 --> 02:43:40.560]
You just were small potatoes, so to speak.

[02:43:41.160 --> 02:43:41.720]
26th after one.

[02:43:41.840 --> 02:43:45.920]
Of course, we know there's isolated incidents because anybody with a half of brain knows for sure.

[02:43:46.080 --> 02:43:47.460]
There's no sight in the church.

[02:43:47.720 --> 02:43:47.820]
Right.

[02:43:48.500 --> 02:43:53.880]
Being outdoors and soft-floated means you really need some comfortable shoes because you do a lot of walking and waltz and around.

[02:43:54.140 --> 02:43:55.100]
Do you do any waltz and around?

[02:43:55.280 --> 02:43:55.540]
Oh yeah.

[02:43:55.540 --> 02:43:56.460]
Just a slip.

[02:43:56.860 --> 02:44:00.360]
So the only place to go is Brandy shoes and pomelo beads to take the best carry your feet.

[02:44:00.820 --> 02:44:05.680]
Brandy's carry his major brands like Floresheim, Echoma Fisto, Rockport, Hush Puffies, New Balance.

[02:44:05.860 --> 02:44:06.400]
Those are my favorites.

[02:44:06.560 --> 02:44:07.280]
I love New Balance shoes.

[02:44:07.640 --> 02:44:09.680]
And tons of other name brands and all sizes for men and women.

[02:44:09.680 --> 02:44:12.540]
They even carry wide wits and hard to find sizes.

[02:44:13.020 --> 02:44:16.120]
Brandy shoes is the largest independent shoe retailer in all of South Florida.

[02:44:16.500 --> 02:44:23.000]
And when you go in there and you see the selection in Brandy, you'll understand why I've been telling you Brandy's is the best for years and years for a veritable lifetime.

[02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:24.520]
Go see our good buddy Arnie.

[02:44:24.660 --> 02:44:26.820]
He'll make sure you get the right to getting shoes for your feet at Brandy's.

[02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:30.100]
Not like those department stores where you wait for a lifetime to get weighted on.

[02:44:30.460 --> 02:44:34.500]
And then finally, whichever style you pick out, whichever one suits your fancy, forget about it.

[02:44:34.540 --> 02:44:35.420]
They don't have it in your size.

[02:44:35.720 --> 02:44:39.940]
You know they're going to have it for you at Brandy's because the only thing they do do at Brandy's is shoes.

[02:44:40.300 --> 02:44:42.400]
So you never have to worry about size, selection, and service.

[02:44:42.720 --> 02:44:43.720]
You want it? They got it.

[02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:48.700]
Brandy shoes are 1290 North Federal Highway and pomelo beads between Atlantic and Coppots on each side.

[02:44:48.960 --> 02:44:49.600]
You can't miss it.

[02:44:49.600 --> 02:44:54.540]
Brandy's open every day of the week, open Mondays, who Saturday till 9 and Sundays until 5 in the PM.

[02:44:54.960 --> 02:44:57.740]
And this week is a great time to buy SAS shoes at Brandy's.

[02:44:57.860 --> 02:45:00.480]
Save 20 to 40 bucks to appear on all great men's and women's styles.

[02:45:00.480 --> 02:45:03.720]
So be sure to get your ass into Brandy's this week or you can do your shoe shopping.

[02:45:03.940 --> 02:45:07.600]
Sit in there on your fat pimpley ass. Just go online at brandy's shoes.com.

[02:45:08.840 --> 02:45:14.500]
This is a new Roger. What's solid? This is 516 QA.

[02:45:16.440 --> 02:45:18.480]
For the flagship stage, big guy.

[02:45:18.480 --> 02:45:20.080]
You hate your butt and thighs.

[02:45:20.280 --> 02:45:22.760]
Yeah. And that dimension is skinny arms.

[02:45:22.920 --> 02:45:25.080]
So why should Lindsay Lohan and Nicole Richie have all the fun?

[02:45:25.320 --> 02:45:26.380]
What do you mean all the fun?

[02:45:26.700 --> 02:45:29.800]
Well over the years straight women have been glorified for being anorexicly skinny.

[02:45:30.120 --> 02:45:32.480]
Thanks to Dennis Quay, we now have something called Manorexia.

[02:45:33.240 --> 02:45:37.400]
And that's right guys. Now we could be skinny. I'm talking Somalia's skinny.

[02:45:37.600 --> 02:45:39.000]
So how do I become Manorexia?

[02:45:39.120 --> 02:45:41.040]
All you have to do is do a bunch of pumpkin starters.

[02:45:41.360 --> 02:45:43.800]
But what about this hot belly I'm getting from the starvation?

[02:45:44.220 --> 02:45:46.740]
My full-faction bitch. It's cool to be skinny.

[02:45:46.740 --> 02:45:48.360]
No, you can hit this eight-baller what?

[02:45:49.760 --> 02:45:51.620]
Cool. I can see my whole spine.

[02:45:52.040 --> 02:45:52.680]
Dennis, right here.

[02:45:52.960 --> 02:45:55.740]
Making even the straightest guy looks like a gay 12-year-old boy.

[02:45:56.560 --> 02:45:59.540]
135, 60, 70, QAM. We have 451 votes.

[02:45:59.620 --> 02:46:01.720]
We'll get to that 500 by the top of the RR.

[02:46:01.960 --> 02:46:03.460]
Josh is the whole show alone next week.

[02:46:03.640 --> 02:46:07.040]
Are we back here just like a little chocolate or something? What's wrong with that?

[02:46:07.720 --> 02:46:09.680]
More like a go-ah. I was laughing at that bit.

[02:46:10.020 --> 02:46:13.760]
I knew it couldn't be what I just said because I'm sure that with that big raise

[02:46:13.760 --> 02:46:18.240]
that Joe was working up for you over there. I can't even say it.

[02:46:19.080 --> 02:46:20.980]
452, you see that? They're pouring in by the ones.

[02:46:21.100 --> 02:46:22.340]
They want to come to your side.

[02:46:22.480 --> 02:46:25.800]
By the way, before we get out of here today, I want to thank the guy that arranged

[02:46:25.800 --> 02:46:28.560]
for the delivery of the communion wafers that I've been harping about so long.

[02:46:28.920 --> 02:46:29.140]
Yeah.

[02:46:30.040 --> 02:46:31.520]
Realized Eucharist will be doing communion.

[02:46:31.900 --> 02:46:32.360]
All right.

[02:46:32.780 --> 02:46:34.500]
Coming soon to a good building.

[02:46:34.740 --> 02:46:34.740]

[02:46:34.740 --> 02:46:36.040]
And for Neil soon.

[02:46:36.420 --> 02:46:36.580]
Good.

[02:46:36.860 --> 02:46:36.980]
Show.

[02:46:37.420 --> 02:46:38.020]
Whatever you just said.

[02:46:39.280 --> 02:46:39.600]
5670560.

[02:46:39.600 --> 02:46:43.400]
I'm going to see you in the town five 60th of their trief on the Verizon Singular wireless lines.

[02:46:43.740 --> 02:46:44.760]
W.A.N. Hello.

[02:46:44.940 --> 02:46:45.640]
Made from Jesus.

[02:46:46.400 --> 02:46:47.000]
So Neil.

[02:46:47.420 --> 02:46:47.740]
Yes, sir.

[02:46:47.980 --> 02:46:48.480]
What's going on?

[02:46:48.760 --> 02:46:49.240]
How you doing?

[02:46:49.560 --> 02:46:49.880]
I'm all right.

[02:46:50.300 --> 02:46:50.460]
Yeah.

[02:46:50.700 --> 02:46:51.900]
We're starting to deal with your dad.

[02:46:52.200 --> 02:46:53.620]
How you start that thing's about to.

[02:46:54.080 --> 02:46:54.880]
You got a penniless?

[02:46:55.320 --> 02:46:56.120]
How about your pardon?

[02:46:56.520 --> 02:46:57.480]
Well, what happened with your dad?

[02:46:57.600 --> 02:46:58.060]
He's dead.

[02:46:58.500 --> 02:46:58.640]
How?

[02:46:59.300 --> 02:46:59.660]
penniless?

[02:46:59.880 --> 02:47:00.580]
You got broke, right?

[02:47:00.900 --> 02:47:02.120]
You're asking me how to hold a vinyl?

[02:47:02.580 --> 02:47:04.240]
You were writing a book?

[02:47:04.680 --> 02:47:05.960]
No, but he was kind of funny that way.

[02:47:06.060 --> 02:47:06.700]
You said it last week.

[02:47:06.700 --> 02:47:07.540]
I'm asking you.

[02:47:07.680 --> 02:47:10.300]
Can you, is speaking of penniless, can you afford like a real phone or you're like at a

[02:47:10.300 --> 02:47:10.960]
sock over it?

[02:47:11.040 --> 02:47:11.860]
Do you have a sock on it now?

[02:47:12.080 --> 02:47:12.800]
No, I got a phone.

[02:47:12.800 --> 02:47:13.420]
About on the phone.

[02:47:13.680 --> 02:47:14.640]
Early search and sock.

[02:47:15.040 --> 02:47:15.180]
Yeah.

[02:47:15.560 --> 02:47:17.420]
Oh, he found the sock that Ernie lost no doubt.

[02:47:17.660 --> 02:47:18.380]
What's so will you dead?

[02:47:18.560 --> 02:47:19.840]
And they mind your own business, okay?

[02:47:20.080 --> 02:47:20.820]
It's a radio show.

[02:47:21.320 --> 02:47:22.200]
What about your dad?

[02:47:22.380 --> 02:47:22.980]
What about your mama?

[02:47:23.260 --> 02:47:24.180]
Okay, that's what I was going to do.

[02:47:24.420 --> 02:47:25.040]
Okay, your mama.

[02:47:25.880 --> 02:47:27.540]
567, speaking of sewing socks and hell.

[02:47:27.860 --> 02:47:29.780]
And pound 56705, Verizon Singular wireless.

[02:47:30.080 --> 02:47:33.520]
See the little Julio's man is sitting around the Christmas tree, around the mulberry

[02:47:33.520 --> 02:47:35.440]
bush, and they're trying to come up with some new ideas.

[02:47:35.920 --> 02:47:39.460]
Of course, basically it's a same old stale crap again.

[02:47:39.700 --> 02:47:41.400]
You know what, let's face it, you guys are out of material.

[02:47:41.740 --> 02:47:44.540]
Since that last great letter that we put up there on the wall on the bulletin board,

[02:47:44.540 --> 02:47:46.120]
which I'm not sure which one it was.

[02:47:46.800 --> 02:47:50.280]
Which one of the first, the first one was the PD Lenny one about the fat-filled sandwiches,

[02:47:50.680 --> 02:47:51.700]
then there was another good one too.

[02:47:52.100 --> 02:47:55.220]
And then the best part of that is that Scrooan got all whipped out and they should probably

[02:47:55.220 --> 02:47:55.660]
know that.

[02:47:56.040 --> 02:47:57.920]
They look at them all in the mood for each other.

[02:47:58.320 --> 02:48:00.080]
Oh yeah, she was conducting an inquisition.

[02:48:00.200 --> 02:48:02.740]
Of course, the QM over there has even a lot of inquisitions.

[02:48:02.740 --> 02:48:05.580]
Even Turkey, my 100% up, my quick goes on there.

[02:48:06.200 --> 02:48:10.160]
Every time somebody would like fart the wrong flavor, every time somebody would get like

[02:48:10.160 --> 02:48:12.040]
a letter in the mail, there's an inquisition.

[02:48:12.160 --> 02:48:13.320]
We want to know who the mul is.

[02:48:13.540 --> 02:48:16.240]
And you know the interesting part of it, Greg reading George W. Bush.

[02:48:16.700 --> 02:48:17.980]
See the similarities now?

[02:48:18.160 --> 02:48:18.960]
The leaker.

[02:48:19.260 --> 02:48:19.940]
Yeah, the leaker.

[02:48:20.040 --> 02:48:21.460]
He always won't run around who's the mul.

[02:48:21.800 --> 02:48:23.780]
Well guess what, just like Bush want to know about the leaks.

[02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:26.320]
Well he's the leaker and Greg was the mul.

[02:48:26.760 --> 02:48:27.840]
Mulie, mulie, mulie.

[02:48:27.880 --> 02:48:28.420]
Yeah, exactly.

[02:48:28.860 --> 02:48:30.140]
Mulie, mulie, mulie.

[02:48:31.480 --> 02:48:32.080]
WQYM, hello.

[02:48:33.100 --> 02:48:38.080]
Yes, I think we should give Bob Sheeper the true to four slot.

[02:48:38.500 --> 02:48:40.200]
Yeah, I didn't know that much these days.

[02:48:40.280 --> 02:48:44.020]
Well, my dog and maybe with 10 crore for a month.

[02:48:44.700 --> 02:48:45.320]
There you go.

[02:48:45.520 --> 02:48:47.120]
Okay, we have two old guys talking again.

[02:48:47.180 --> 02:48:48.300]
We've got two old guys at 10.

[02:48:48.660 --> 02:48:49.940]
We have two ancient guys at two.

[02:48:50.060 --> 02:48:50.900]
Me and the old Bobby.

[02:48:51.280 --> 02:48:52.100]
Hey Bobby, how's things?

[02:48:52.160 --> 02:48:52.620]
Okie-dokie?

[02:48:53.420 --> 02:48:55.760]
You know, this business about their numbers went up when he went on.

[02:48:56.140 --> 02:48:56.860]
I'm sorry.

[02:48:56.860 --> 02:49:02.640]
Maybe they're, you know, 89 plus number, you know, like from 89 years of age to death.

[02:49:03.040 --> 02:49:06.420]
There's no way that anybody under 100 is going to watch Bob Sheeper doing that news.

[02:49:06.580 --> 02:49:08.400]
I mean, he's just a fossil.

[02:49:09.460 --> 02:49:10.100]
WQYM, hello.

[02:49:11.420 --> 02:49:11.820]
Neo.

[02:49:12.320 --> 02:49:12.700]
Yes, sir.

[02:49:13.140 --> 02:49:13.540]
Friday.

[02:49:14.140 --> 02:49:17.420]
First of all, nobody's in the feet too mad from two to four.

[02:49:17.620 --> 02:49:19.260]
That's kind of the best idea.

[02:49:19.260 --> 02:49:19.260]

[02:49:19.520 --> 02:49:20.660]
That's the best idea, right?

[02:49:20.920 --> 02:49:25.100]
And on the back of the way first, when it says the gradient, does it just say G-sys bottle?

[02:49:25.480 --> 02:49:25.720]
Yes.

[02:49:26.280 --> 02:49:27.160]
Body of Christ.

[02:49:27.460 --> 02:49:29.260]
Body of Christ, it says under B.O.C.

[02:49:29.600 --> 02:49:30.000]
Body of Christ.

[02:49:30.100 --> 02:49:31.600]
Deadly sliced body of Christ.

[02:49:31.840 --> 02:49:32.540]
Oh, I like that.

[02:49:33.120 --> 02:49:34.200]
Quit making on our boy.

[02:49:35.200 --> 02:49:35.560]
5670560.

[02:49:35.720 --> 02:49:36.080]
There's that film.

[02:49:36.180 --> 02:49:38.300]
I mean, I heard he's got his own TV show now.

[02:49:38.780 --> 02:49:39.400]
On NBC.

[02:49:40.340 --> 02:49:41.800]
That guy, that guy yesterday, man.

[02:49:42.080 --> 02:49:43.460]
You people just kill me.

[02:49:43.580 --> 02:49:44.640]
It's just hysterical.

[02:49:45.060 --> 02:49:47.020]
They all got an angle.

[02:49:47.320 --> 02:49:49.540]
If I call up and say, real fast, like, who would care?

[02:49:49.740 --> 02:49:50.280]
Who would care?

[02:49:50.460 --> 02:49:52.260]
You know, I gave the whole story about it the day before.

[02:49:52.840 --> 02:49:55.000]
I was going to say, so TV show, I said, like, real fast, you know?

[02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.700]
That's why I read the story about how bad it was the day before.

[02:49:58.020 --> 02:49:59.460]
Very slowly and deliberately.

[02:49:59.880 --> 02:50:02.000]
In fact, if you're real talk real, I saw, I read it again.

[02:50:02.740 --> 02:50:03.500]
I still have it.

[02:50:03.700 --> 02:50:04.100]
Well, good.

[02:50:04.260 --> 02:50:05.260]
We'll read it on Monday again.

[02:50:05.280 --> 02:50:06.160]
I hear him keeping it handy.

[02:50:06.680 --> 02:50:10.160]
Tell me, do you know how you doing?

[02:50:10.480 --> 02:50:11.940]
I don't know who I would put.

[02:50:12.060 --> 02:50:15.940]
If you could resurrect anyone, I'll put Tiny up there, because I'd love to hear Tiny do a show.

[02:50:16.240 --> 02:50:18.300]
You know, probably be where we got now.

[02:50:18.780 --> 02:50:19.060]
Same thing.

[02:50:19.140 --> 02:50:20.640]
Talked in the same register as Gildi.

[02:50:21.120 --> 02:50:21.820]
Same as Squeak.

[02:50:22.220 --> 02:50:22.880]
That's another thing.

[02:50:22.880 --> 02:50:24.880]
You know, all these people are so concerned with Tiny, you know?

[02:50:25.240 --> 02:50:25.600]
I understand.

[02:50:25.780 --> 02:50:26.480]
I can relate to that.

[02:50:27.040 --> 02:50:27.940]
W-E-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:50:29.160 --> 02:50:29.620]
I know.

[02:50:29.740 --> 02:50:31.120]
I had to go to work at two-a-M.

[02:50:31.120 --> 02:50:31.660]
Okay, go ahead.

[02:50:31.700 --> 02:50:32.080]
I see that.

[02:50:32.200 --> 02:50:32.780]
Touch it, Agonda.

[02:50:32.980 --> 02:50:33.440]
Real quick.

[02:50:33.640 --> 02:50:34.020]
My bad.

[02:50:34.520 --> 02:50:35.040]
You know, you're bad.

[02:50:35.120 --> 02:50:35.720]
It was really important.

[02:50:36.460 --> 02:50:36.900]
I'm bad.

[02:50:37.060 --> 02:50:37.600]
How about the pot?

[02:50:38.100 --> 02:50:38.920]
Third was smoking it.

[02:50:39.260 --> 02:50:40.120]
W-E-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:50:41.740 --> 02:50:42.620]
Q-A-M, hello.

[02:50:43.760 --> 02:50:44.080]
Narcline.

[02:50:44.800 --> 02:50:45.660]
W-E-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:50:46.900 --> 02:50:48.060]
Can we do three in a row here?

[02:50:48.380 --> 02:50:49.080]
I think we got a shot.

[02:50:50.820 --> 02:50:51.540]
Q-A-M.

[02:50:51.880 --> 02:50:52.900]
Yeah, Neil Rogers.

[02:50:53.240 --> 02:50:53.600]
Yes, sir.

[02:50:53.800 --> 02:50:54.300]
Thank you, boys.

[02:50:55.200 --> 02:50:55.720]
You're welcome.

[02:50:55.960 --> 02:50:56.520]
Your mama.

[02:50:57.320 --> 02:50:58.240]
So, Saks and Hill.

[02:50:58.780 --> 02:51:01.300]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60.

[02:51:01.560 --> 02:51:03.340]
See, now the audience doesn't know what to do, see?

[02:51:03.820 --> 02:51:05.600]
Because we were like, taking care of...

[02:51:05.600 --> 02:51:06.280]
No, no, no, no, no.

[02:51:06.320 --> 02:51:06.820]
You don't understand.

[02:51:06.980 --> 02:51:07.780]
I'm not talking about that.

[02:51:07.960 --> 02:51:09.180]
Not that they ever had any material.

[02:51:09.260 --> 02:51:12.060]
But I'm just saying, now they don't want to scream or peel like banana.

[02:51:12.840 --> 02:51:15.880]
Remember that guy with the eyes was talking about the banana that he was listening for?

[02:51:16.160 --> 02:51:16.740]
Well, here's the deal.

[02:51:16.880 --> 02:51:17.380]
They don't know what to do.

[02:51:17.440 --> 02:51:19.000]
Because now we're taking a million calls on the show.

[02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:22.400]
Whereas we'd watered it down to just a few here, a couple over there.

[02:51:22.720 --> 02:51:24.600]
And now they're under pressure.

[02:51:25.060 --> 02:51:27.360]
Like Maria Bartoromo would say, they're coming under pressure.

[02:51:27.840 --> 02:51:28.560]
You know how she says that?

[02:51:28.980 --> 02:51:29.120]
Yeah.

[02:51:29.500 --> 02:51:31.540]
Man, she's got bags under those eyes.

[02:51:31.760 --> 02:51:35.380]
Or even people that take like their whole other possessions on the plane.

[02:51:35.780 --> 02:51:37.260]
Never carry bags that size.

[02:51:37.540 --> 02:51:38.060]
Just unreal.

[02:51:38.880 --> 02:51:39.680]
Q-A-M, hello.

[02:51:40.020 --> 02:51:40.740]
Are we on the radio?

[02:51:41.300 --> 02:51:42.280]
Q-A-M, hello.

[02:51:43.320 --> 02:51:44.860]
Neil, this one guy I think you were left off.

[02:51:45.280 --> 02:51:45.440]
Yes?

[02:51:46.360 --> 02:51:47.680]
What did I ever do to you guys?

[02:51:47.680 --> 02:51:48.440]
Now.

[02:51:48.700 --> 02:51:50.060]
What did I ever do?

[02:51:50.060 --> 02:51:50.180]
No.

[02:51:50.500 --> 02:51:51.460]
What did I ever do?

[02:51:51.460 --> 02:51:51.700]
Foring.

[02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:52.900]
What did I ever do?

[02:51:53.040 --> 02:51:53.460]
Comotose.

[02:51:53.740 --> 02:51:54.440]
What did I ever do?

[02:51:54.440 --> 02:51:55.400]
Suicide inducing.

[02:51:56.020 --> 02:51:57.660]
At least you didn't call line I'm this time.

[02:51:57.780 --> 02:51:58.320]
That's the first though.

[02:51:58.420 --> 02:51:59.060]
Q-A-M, hello.

[02:51:59.440 --> 02:51:59.980]
Oh, god.

[02:52:00.040 --> 02:52:01.240]
You sound so stupid.

[02:52:01.420 --> 02:52:02.900]
I hate to talk to you.

[02:52:04.800 --> 02:52:07.300]
Oh, and you know we can't even play that anymore either.

[02:52:07.560 --> 02:52:08.720]
Is it's got, huh?

[02:52:09.100 --> 02:52:09.460]
Uh-huh.

[02:52:09.620 --> 02:52:11.140]
It's got the VB in there.

[02:52:11.660 --> 02:52:17.440]
If you missed the Neil Rogers show yesterday on 610WIOD, you missed this.

[02:52:17.840 --> 02:52:19.020]
Is this the bird?

[02:52:19.300 --> 02:52:19.620]
Yeah.

[02:52:19.760 --> 02:52:20.640]
Bird, how you doing?

[02:52:20.680 --> 02:52:22.160]
You'll see, but that wasn't even the right guy.

[02:52:22.540 --> 02:52:25.320]
That's just a bird inquisitor, a bird-agitator, Jr.

[02:52:25.840 --> 02:52:26.380]
Another wannabe.

[02:52:26.840 --> 02:52:27.680]
You'll never make it, pal.

[02:52:28.260 --> 02:52:29.180]
WQ-A-M, hello.

[02:52:29.880 --> 02:52:31.100]
Is this Neil Beowelper?

[02:52:31.700 --> 02:52:32.020]
Speaking.

[02:52:32.500 --> 02:52:32.860]
How are you?

[02:52:33.300 --> 02:52:34.600]
Can I hear a little Dwayne Stump?

[02:52:35.780 --> 02:52:36.260]
Dwayne, yeah.

[02:52:36.340 --> 02:52:37.300]
I think he already got it.

[02:52:37.860 --> 02:52:38.940]
He wants a Dwayne Stump.

[02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:43.340]
567-0560, 05-60, and the Verizon Singular wireless line.

[02:52:43.460 --> 02:52:43.740]
Guess what?

[02:52:43.840 --> 02:52:44.300]
He can read.

[02:52:44.300 --> 02:52:44.920]
Not exciting?

[02:52:45.640 --> 02:52:46.520]
WQ-A-M, hello.

[02:52:47.120 --> 02:52:49.700]
He puts Matt Sundin in the basket.

[02:52:50.080 --> 02:52:51.380]
Yeah, well, that's a good place for him, okay?

[02:52:51.460 --> 02:52:53.080]
Because he sure can't put the biscuit in the basket.

[02:52:53.440 --> 02:52:54.640]
Nice going on on a shootout, Pat.

[02:52:55.020 --> 02:52:56.460]
Just put the three same guys under.

[02:52:56.600 --> 02:52:57.160]
They can't do it.

[02:52:57.400 --> 02:52:57.880]
Every game.

[02:52:58.060 --> 02:52:58.860]
Over and over again.

[02:52:59.140 --> 02:53:00.620]
They may not be good, at least they're consistent.

[02:53:01.160 --> 02:53:03.220]
The old Mighty Quinn, I think he won't see him no more.

[02:53:03.880 --> 02:53:04.820]
WQ-A-M, hello.

[02:53:05.380 --> 02:53:05.560]
Hello?

[02:53:06.140 --> 02:53:06.500]
Yes, sir.

[02:53:07.600 --> 02:53:08.660]
Is this WID?

[02:53:08.960 --> 02:53:10.940]
W-I-W-I-D hockey talk, yes.

[02:53:11.420 --> 02:53:11.920]
Oh, okay.

[02:53:12.400 --> 02:53:12.940]
Who you calling?

[02:53:13.760 --> 02:53:14.160]
Yeah.

[02:53:14.840 --> 02:53:15.940]
Why are you asking this is WID?

[02:53:16.920 --> 02:53:17.940]
When's the last time we were on WID?

[02:53:18.640 --> 02:53:19.340]
About 100 years ago?

[02:53:20.640 --> 02:53:21.040]
Nine.

[02:53:21.500 --> 02:53:21.780]
Really?

[02:53:22.100 --> 02:53:23.700]
You're not counting the seven months I got paid off.

[02:53:23.900 --> 02:53:24.880]
Yeah, we're going to do it for you, sir.

[02:53:25.300 --> 02:53:25.540]
Hello.

[02:53:26.140 --> 02:53:26.520]
Hello.

[02:53:26.960 --> 02:53:27.200]
Hello.

[02:53:27.660 --> 02:53:28.540]
WQ-A-M.

[02:53:28.860 --> 02:53:30.480]
Is everything going to go to motion?

[02:53:30.680 --> 02:53:31.720]
Motion, motion, motion.

[02:53:31.960 --> 02:53:32.640]
Fight of motion.

[02:53:33.140 --> 02:53:33.340]
Oh.

[02:53:35.240 --> 02:53:35.640]
Oh.

[02:53:36.080 --> 02:53:38.140]
Oh, and I think he just answered his own question.

[02:53:38.560 --> 02:53:39.420]
Too many goi-a, man.

[02:53:40.080 --> 02:53:41.000]
WQ-A-M, hello.

[02:53:41.600 --> 02:53:42.920]
Yeah, Matt's talking the up to you.

[02:53:42.920 --> 02:53:43.960]
I'm just looking at the motion, and Rick and Sudden.

[02:53:43.960 --> 02:53:44.820]
It's a no-brainer.

[02:53:44.980 --> 02:53:45.580]
You'll be great.

[02:53:46.100 --> 02:53:47.500]
Oh, everybody wants that.

[02:53:47.620 --> 02:53:48.280]
What's the problem?

[02:53:48.740 --> 02:53:48.880]
Yeah.

[02:53:56.420 --> 02:53:58.460]
Let's take a look at how that pull is shaping up, baby.

[02:53:58.780 --> 02:53:59.740]
Shape up or shape out.

[02:53:59.900 --> 02:54:00.860]
When it does, shape it out.

[02:54:01.320 --> 02:54:03.560]
See, I told you, it put a good smile on your face with these

[02:54:03.560 --> 02:54:03.940]
embassies.

[02:54:04.040 --> 02:54:06.180]
I mean, with these great calls, 473 votes.

[02:54:06.600 --> 02:54:08.660]
Who should get the permanent two-to-fourth slot of Q-A-M?

[02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:10.560]
Suds Coulman 85, a mad dog 85.

[02:54:10.820 --> 02:54:11.620]
They came make up their mind.

[02:54:12.360 --> 02:54:13.500]
Suds Coulman ain't going to be on the beat.

[02:54:13.540 --> 02:54:15.340]
You know, he boxed himself into a corner.

[02:54:15.560 --> 02:54:18.100]
Because every time Rick would be in a sicker or something like that,

[02:54:18.620 --> 02:54:21.080]
you don't have to go to church to pray extra to be forgiven.

[02:54:21.980 --> 02:54:22.840]
Suds would go home.

[02:54:22.940 --> 02:54:23.820]
They'd slap a tape on him.

[02:54:23.880 --> 02:54:26.460]
He would go home under the guise that he can't do a show by himself.

[02:54:26.820 --> 02:54:27.180]
Remember that?

[02:54:27.400 --> 02:54:27.560]
Right.

[02:54:28.460 --> 02:54:31.240]
So where is the logic that he's going to carry a two-hour show by himself?

[02:54:31.520 --> 02:54:32.680]
Because he doesn't think he can do it.

[02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:34.000]
And maybe he's right, I don't know.

[02:54:34.300 --> 02:54:36.960]
I mean, he's fine going in there and even lunch with you on Fridays.

[02:54:37.760 --> 02:54:40.160]
Now, when he comes in, do you have to guys have macaroni and cheese?

[02:54:40.680 --> 02:54:41.120]
We have it.

[02:54:41.120 --> 02:54:43.100]
Nice again for that music, by the way, Suds.

[02:54:43.220 --> 02:54:46.880]
Thanks for the change in my life, standing in the shadows of Motom.

[02:54:47.060 --> 02:54:47.780]
That's the goal.

[02:54:48.120 --> 02:54:51.180]
You'll be getting a book in the next diplomatic pouch that he gave me

[02:54:51.180 --> 02:54:52.180]
to give the book and to give it to you.

[02:54:52.260 --> 02:54:53.080]
A book of what?

[02:54:53.200 --> 02:54:53.520]
That book?

[02:54:53.660 --> 02:54:56.980]
A Robert Ingersoll book, you know, the famous atheist from the 1800s?

[02:54:57.120 --> 02:54:57.400]
Yes.

[02:54:57.860 --> 02:54:58.300]
Good stuff.

[02:54:58.460 --> 02:54:58.780]
Famous stuff.

[02:54:58.780 --> 02:55:00.080]
Oh, there's nothing we know, Ayn Rand.

[02:55:00.600 --> 02:55:01.160]
Oh, I hate her.

[02:55:01.520 --> 02:55:01.960]
I'm Rand.

[02:55:02.180 --> 02:55:03.020]
Suddoran Electro-Bitt.

[02:55:03.020 --> 02:55:04.180]
I'm Farcarcher Claimicite.

[02:55:04.620 --> 02:55:06.460]
Suds Coulman 85, a mad dog 85.

[02:55:06.920 --> 02:55:07.180]
Moishi.

[02:55:07.180 --> 02:55:09.160]
Who drew a Moishi Rodriguez got 68.

[02:55:09.700 --> 02:55:10.840]
I won't listen anyway, 57.

[02:55:10.960 --> 02:55:12.120]
No matter what you put on, we won't listen.

[02:55:12.320 --> 02:55:12.560]
Yeah.

[02:55:12.940 --> 02:55:14.640]
Curtis 38, bring back Moe 37.

[02:55:15.040 --> 02:55:16.080]
The big O 28.

[02:55:16.440 --> 02:55:18.620]
Reverend Jones 18, Kim O'Campre 14.

[02:55:19.040 --> 02:55:19.720]
The Crow 13.

[02:55:20.260 --> 02:55:21.940]
Gieldi, Sultimaente Dosey.

[02:55:22.120 --> 02:55:23.340]
They can always take him in small doses.

[02:55:23.900 --> 02:55:25.020]
I hate this pool 9.

[02:55:25.220 --> 02:55:26.060]
Joe Zagaki 5.

[02:55:26.340 --> 02:55:29.600]
Ernie Sochens got three pair and Lany Martez Sultimaente Trace.

[02:55:30.020 --> 02:55:32.100]
This is Neil Rogers.

[02:55:33.220 --> 02:55:35.900]
This is 516-2-A.

[02:55:38.580 --> 02:55:40.020]
The Yubeskies.

[02:55:45.160 --> 02:55:47.200]
It's 30 a day plus gas.

[02:55:47.640 --> 02:55:49.400]
Well, I ran in Lincoln.

[02:55:50.280 --> 02:55:53.020]
Gashartcran and I drove up in the hill.

[02:55:53.120 --> 02:55:56.740]
You want me in shirts and recall how it happened.

[02:55:57.140 --> 02:56:00.560]
Well, it still gives me change.

[02:56:01.060 --> 02:56:02.160]
What a weirdo.

[02:56:02.420 --> 02:56:05.220]
Followed my map of star house sales.

[02:56:05.220 --> 02:56:07.920]
And one shot to see.

[02:56:09.280 --> 02:56:15.040]
Sitting on her front porch was Angelina Jolie.

[02:56:16.620 --> 02:56:18.200]
Yeah, no, no, no.

[02:56:18.580 --> 02:56:21.220]
I walked up like I knew her.

[02:56:21.440 --> 02:56:22.300]
Hey, do I know you?

[02:56:22.340 --> 02:56:24.180]
When I saw her hesitate.

[02:56:24.780 --> 02:56:25.040]
Yeah.

[02:56:25.320 --> 02:56:29.820]
But the core of porn started working and for her.

[02:56:30.120 --> 02:56:31.740]
It was too late.

[02:56:33.120 --> 02:56:39.860]
But her in my car and rolled the windows down.

[02:56:40.460 --> 02:56:46.880]
Now she washed my queen and I made her crown.

[02:56:48.060 --> 02:56:50.200]
But this is a crown of me.

[02:56:50.240 --> 02:56:55.440]
And I've got Angelina Jolie in my basement.

[02:56:57.760 --> 02:57:00.920]
And I think I'll keep her there with me.

[02:57:00.920 --> 02:57:01.420]
Hello.

[02:57:01.920 --> 02:57:03.520]
And charge her ring.

[02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:04.640]
I can't ring.

[02:57:04.840 --> 02:57:06.220]
Well, I hope she don't mind.

[02:57:06.800 --> 02:57:10.420]
I hope that you'll find that she likes the cement.

[02:57:11.400 --> 02:57:12.920]
I'll spend the time in the front.

[02:57:13.220 --> 02:57:19.440]
How wonderful life is with Angelina Jolie in my basement.

[02:57:21.240 --> 02:57:21.980]
Wait for me.

[02:57:22.200 --> 02:57:23.180]
I want to get...

[02:57:23.180 --> 02:57:26.640]
Watch your dramatic, pull her in my neck.

[02:57:26.860 --> 02:57:29.160]
But I bet you'd give your last set.

[02:57:30.200 --> 02:57:31.240]
Hello, babe.

[02:57:31.640 --> 02:57:37.940]
To heaven, Angelina Jolie locked down in your basement.

[02:57:40.280 --> 02:57:41.480]
I'll tell her my dog.

[02:57:41.740 --> 02:57:42.220]
I'll tell her.

[02:57:42.600 --> 02:57:43.340]
Don't her precious.

[02:57:43.480 --> 02:57:44.700]
I'll hurt your dog, mister.

[02:57:44.920 --> 02:57:46.500]
I'm gonna punch the dog in the basket.

[02:57:46.880 --> 02:57:48.100]
146.4102.

[02:57:48.220 --> 02:57:50.240]
So it's amazing what's on this website.

[02:57:50.920 --> 02:57:53.700]
Bangitout.com, the Jewish caption contest.

[02:57:53.900 --> 02:57:55.500]
And the reason I couldn't find Getski is because,

[02:57:55.660 --> 02:57:58.060]
again, it has to do with the pronunciation with dialect,

[02:57:58.760 --> 02:58:01.220]
and Getski, Shmata and Shmati, that kind of thing.

[02:58:01.240 --> 02:58:01.780]
Yalika, Yalika.

[02:58:01.780 --> 02:58:04.780]
If you look up Getska, that's right. Getska, you'll find it.

[02:58:04.960 --> 02:58:05.140]
I.

[02:58:05.160 --> 02:58:05.500]
Getska.

[02:58:05.740 --> 02:58:06.500]
Getska and Kishki.

[02:58:06.500 --> 02:58:08.300]
Well, play the Getska on us.

[02:58:08.620 --> 02:58:10.540]
So anyway, well, that doesn't really have a definition,

[02:58:10.680 --> 02:58:11.300]
but it's got a pitch.

[02:58:11.640 --> 02:58:15.840]
It's got a contest for a caption for this picture,

[02:58:15.960 --> 02:58:18.400]
and it shows that Orthodox Jew with the past and the hand

[02:58:18.400 --> 02:58:20.540]
and the holding you facing a snowman.

[02:58:21.200 --> 02:58:22.420]
Snowman's got a carrot in its mouth,

[02:58:22.560 --> 02:58:25.840]
and it's got one of those hats that the Hussein wear on the

[02:58:25.840 --> 02:58:26.980]
top of the snowman's head.

[02:58:26.980 --> 02:58:28.360]
Would like the fur hockey puck.

[02:58:28.880 --> 02:58:30.680]
And here are some of the contest entries,

[02:58:30.900 --> 02:58:32.640]
one from Robert Besser in Boka.

[02:58:33.340 --> 02:58:36.640]
But now here's one from Shmi Unger in Borough Park.

[02:58:36.960 --> 02:58:38.760]
Yankele is convinced there's something obvious attractive

[02:58:38.760 --> 02:58:40.320]
about this particular Getska.

[02:58:41.880 --> 02:58:42.760]
There you go.

[02:58:43.240 --> 02:58:44.620]
Oh, this stuff is incredible.

[02:58:44.940 --> 02:58:45.980]
Here's something about a bris...

[02:58:46.620 --> 02:58:48.260]
Boy, my God.

[02:58:48.520 --> 02:58:49.900]
Oh, Shalomist, there's snowmensch.

[02:58:50.220 --> 02:58:50.900]
Wanna trade hats?

[02:58:51.600 --> 02:58:52.560]
Oh, you've raised me.

[02:58:52.800 --> 02:58:53.320]
Holy cow.

[02:58:53.720 --> 02:58:54.500]
So anyway, there you go.

[02:58:54.600 --> 02:58:55.860]
It's just open up a whole new avenue.

[02:58:55.860 --> 02:58:57.120]
And where did that all come from?

[02:58:57.340 --> 02:58:58.620]
That came from the guy I don't know where he could

[02:58:58.620 --> 02:58:59.920]
define the definition of Getska.

[02:59:00.240 --> 02:59:01.080]
Just Google it, baby.

[02:59:01.580 --> 02:59:02.940]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:59:03.180 --> 02:59:04.240]
Oh, tornado on the ground.

[02:59:04.360 --> 02:59:05.660]
30 miles west of Nashville, Tennessee.

[02:59:05.960 --> 02:59:06.900]
It's not a way to Nashville,

[02:59:06.920 --> 02:59:09.120]
because God's really peered at all in Miyahu's,

[02:59:09.180 --> 02:59:09.880]
all in crackers,

[02:59:10.280 --> 02:59:11.160]
for all in foreign,

[02:59:11.260 --> 02:59:13.000]
in the illegal, uh, appropriate,

[02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:14.020]
and whatever they're doing there.

[02:59:14.320 --> 02:59:15.780]
And for closing all the delis up there,

[02:59:15.820 --> 02:59:17.440]
to an Nashville. God's peered about that.

[02:59:18.280 --> 02:59:19.040]
WDQA, Ann, hello.

[02:59:19.740 --> 02:59:20.100]
Neil.

[02:59:20.540 --> 02:59:20.900]
Yes, sir.

[02:59:21.220 --> 02:59:21.720]
How are you?

[02:59:22.020 --> 02:59:22.380]
Excellent.

[02:59:23.640 --> 02:59:25.080]
In a happy face, all by the way.

[02:59:25.080 --> 02:59:26.440]
Coming back to you, back to you.

[02:59:26.600 --> 02:59:27.860]
Uh, I have a shimmy request,

[02:59:28.180 --> 02:59:29.920]
including with the theme today, if that's okay.

[02:59:30.220 --> 02:59:30.420]
Yes?

[02:59:30.900 --> 02:59:32.520]
Uh, that'll, my name is Hi.

[02:59:33.420 --> 02:59:34.560]
Oh, my name is Hi.

[02:59:35.120 --> 02:59:35.780]
My name is Hi.

[02:59:36.140 --> 02:59:37.240]
Oh, I got it.

[02:59:37.440 --> 02:59:38.980]
And in closing, then I get some

[02:59:38.980 --> 02:59:39.900]
copy on the shmackle.

[02:59:39.940 --> 02:59:40.660]
That's three legs.

[02:59:41.020 --> 02:59:41.440]
See you.

[02:59:41.740 --> 02:59:42.900]
See I was already pointed at.

[02:59:42.980 --> 02:59:44.080]
Now he got me knackered down.

[02:59:44.360 --> 02:59:44.360]

[02:59:44.420 --> 02:59:45.380]
That's all over it, huh?

[02:59:45.520 --> 02:59:46.620]
Why are you, because he stepped on it.

[02:59:46.800 --> 02:59:48.180]
I drive a mercury.

[02:59:48.900 --> 02:59:50.260]
That's three lanes wide.

[02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:51.400]
Oi!

[02:59:52.620 --> 02:59:54.560]
I can't see over the hill.

[02:59:54.560 --> 02:59:56.320]
Because I'm three-foot-five.

[02:59:57.140 --> 02:59:58.280]
Uh, uh, uh.

[02:59:58.280 --> 03:00:00.000]
Have a drink of oxygen.

[03:00:00.820 --> 03:00:01.980]
To keep me alive.

[03:00:02.760 --> 03:00:03.320]
Oi!

[03:00:03.980 --> 03:00:04.820]
My name is Hi.

[03:00:05.320 --> 03:00:06.280]
My name is Hi.

[03:00:06.820 --> 03:00:07.780]
My name is Hi.

[03:00:09.360 --> 03:00:11.760]
Gotta go find for some sweet juice.

[03:00:12.240 --> 03:00:13.180]
So I bought five.

[03:00:15.220 --> 03:00:18.940]
When the passion told me it was only for the larger size.

[03:00:20.680 --> 03:00:22.940]
I bought the thing and discussed.

[03:00:22.940 --> 03:00:25.380]
After farting in line.

[03:00:25.660 --> 03:00:25.900]
Yeah!

[03:00:26.340 --> 03:00:27.200]
Because my name is Hi.

[03:00:27.540 --> 03:00:28.560]
My name is Hi.

[03:00:29.160 --> 03:00:30.200]
My name is Hi.

[03:00:32.280 --> 03:00:35.780]
Make sure to always be boy for dinner at five.

[03:00:37.560 --> 03:00:40.080]
The soup was cold to dark the browns

[03:00:40.080 --> 03:00:41.420]
all they had was lime.

[03:00:42.680 --> 03:00:43.200]
Yeah!

[03:00:43.720 --> 03:00:45.720]
Love and they had the meat that check.

[03:00:46.400 --> 03:00:47.480]
I left them a dime.

[03:00:48.700 --> 03:00:50.000]
Because my name is Hi.

[03:00:50.500 --> 03:00:51.400]
My name is Hi.

[03:00:55.300 --> 03:00:58.940]
My condo sets the rules that I live by.

[03:01:00.780 --> 03:01:02.400]
No younger than 92.

[03:01:03.780 --> 03:01:04.400]
But still alive.

[03:01:06.420 --> 03:01:08.620]
No goal reason, the fool.

[03:01:08.980 --> 03:01:10.260]
But type as a fine.

[03:01:11.440 --> 03:01:12.780]
My name is Hi.

[03:01:13.120 --> 03:01:14.220]
My name is Hi.

[03:01:14.640 --> 03:01:15.860]
My name is Hi.

[03:01:16.300 --> 03:01:17.160]
Hi, Italian!

[03:01:17.900 --> 03:01:18.900]
150-10-2, Bano.

[03:01:19.060 --> 03:01:20.320]
Man, this thing is flown by today.

[03:01:20.320 --> 03:01:21.660]
You know what I mean?

[03:01:21.660 --> 03:01:24.100]
Now when you go into a good deli, you have to get a Dr. Browns.

[03:01:24.100 --> 03:01:26.940]
Dr. Browns black cherry soda with your own sandwich.

[03:01:27.300 --> 03:01:27.440]
What?

[03:01:27.660 --> 03:01:28.420]
The light black cherry.

[03:01:28.800 --> 03:01:29.380]
Oh, come on.

[03:01:29.420 --> 03:01:29.860]
That's what you had.

[03:01:29.920 --> 03:01:31.020]
They also make it in diet.

[03:01:31.220 --> 03:01:31.900]
You can have it in a diet.

[03:01:32.340 --> 03:01:34.460]
Not all types of Dr. Pepper, all that black cherry.

[03:01:34.740 --> 03:01:35.660]
Get out of here.

[03:01:35.840 --> 03:01:37.900]
Dr. Browns, do you remember Dr. Browns?

[03:01:38.060 --> 03:01:39.640]
Dr. Browns root beer, cream soda.

[03:01:40.040 --> 03:01:41.660]
Oh, like I said, they're making it into a flavor.

[03:01:41.860 --> 03:01:42.020]
It is.

[03:01:42.040 --> 03:01:43.080]
I'm just using it as an example.

[03:01:43.280 --> 03:01:44.140]
Or this is my favorite right.

[03:01:44.280 --> 03:01:45.500]
That Dr. Browns.

[03:01:45.540 --> 03:01:47.060]
Well, you have the all the root beer.

[03:01:47.360 --> 03:01:47.620]
All right.

[03:01:47.820 --> 03:01:48.700]
And I'll have the black cherry.

[03:01:49.140 --> 03:01:50.780]
We got our 500 vote.

[03:01:50.920 --> 03:01:51.700]
We got 504.

[03:01:52.120 --> 03:01:54.480]
We got 504 vote on our second poll of the day.

[03:01:54.600 --> 03:01:56.640]
We had over 1100 in the first one about Katie Court.

[03:01:57.100 --> 03:01:59.000]
And the general reaction was, fat.

[03:01:59.300 --> 03:02:00.780]
Even the guy I know who that means fat.

[03:02:01.880 --> 03:02:03.920]
That's what we got that in the Netherlands.

[03:02:03.920 --> 03:02:04.980]
I got familiar with that.

[03:02:05.140 --> 03:02:05.520]
Fah soap.

[03:02:05.660 --> 03:02:05.900]
F A.

[03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:07.220]
I don't know where that's not made in the Netherlands.

[03:02:07.420 --> 03:02:08.880]
I don't even make soap there because they don't use it.

[03:02:09.260 --> 03:02:09.440]
Fah.

[03:02:09.740 --> 03:02:10.060]
For your fa.

[03:02:10.300 --> 03:02:12.380]
But for the Arabs, it's fat.

[03:02:13.120 --> 03:02:14.820]
I don't think the air, well, I shouldn't say that.

[03:02:15.100 --> 03:02:17.200]
I was going to make some comment about the Saudis using soap.

[03:02:17.480 --> 03:02:18.060]
That would be bad.

[03:02:18.060 --> 03:02:20.020]
But even if they did, it would have made any difference.

[03:02:20.220 --> 03:02:20.660]
That's me.

[03:02:20.800 --> 03:02:21.540]
It's like the Haseen.

[03:02:21.540 --> 03:02:22.500]
It would have made any difference.

[03:02:22.780 --> 03:02:24.540]
Don't drop the body wash, whatever you do.

[03:02:25.020 --> 03:02:26.800]
Now, you notice slowly, but surely they're coming around.

[03:02:27.080 --> 03:02:29.640]
I'm looking at the last break in this hour in the show today.

[03:02:30.280 --> 03:02:34.740]
And I'm thinking to myself, oh speaking of Yiddish words and all of a sudden crap we've been talking about.

[03:02:34.960 --> 03:02:36.220]
I just, I don't get it.

[03:02:36.440 --> 03:02:40.880]
Hey, Chris, I know you're talking good game there with that top Carolina North Carolina draw, whatever it is.

[03:02:41.080 --> 03:02:42.380]
But you guys back there, man.

[03:02:43.080 --> 03:02:44.880]
You need to get with you, put Brown, baby.

[03:02:44.880 --> 03:02:47.760]
You got to get your, get your house and odor.

[03:02:48.040 --> 03:02:49.700]
It's not just the last, look at the whole last page.

[03:02:50.040 --> 03:02:52.100]
I mean, oh, I know you don't have to tell me that.

[03:02:53.160 --> 03:02:53.860]
I know that.

[03:02:54.140 --> 03:02:55.960]
There wasn't been one, well, yeah, there was one.

[03:02:56.020 --> 03:02:59.980]
Of course, I was a trade-out, the third break in the, every other break in this hour was like two minutes or less.

[03:03:00.520 --> 03:03:01.440]
And that's because I filled it.

[03:03:01.600 --> 03:03:03.680]
It's, it's really, you know, the fill in.

[03:03:04.760 --> 03:03:05.400]
Pretty embarrassing.

[03:03:06.400 --> 03:03:08.560]
This is Joe Bell and his new way, G-Man.

[03:03:08.660 --> 03:03:09.120]
He's all excited.

[03:03:09.280 --> 03:03:12.060]
He's bringing a heavyweight in and he's got a couple of real heavyweights coming in.

[03:03:12.060 --> 03:03:16.300]
And by the way, if there's any people who audition for a job in sales at QM today, forget about it.

[03:03:16.360 --> 03:03:17.620]
That's my best suggestion to you, okay?

[03:03:17.960 --> 03:03:18.520]
Forget about it.

[03:03:18.780 --> 03:03:20.720]
I mean, it's like buying a ticket on the Titanic.

[03:03:20.860 --> 03:03:21.680]
Look, God about it.

[03:03:21.740 --> 03:03:23.280]
Right now, what anybody would have brained do that.

[03:03:24.100 --> 03:03:25.700]
This is me, Rod.

[03:03:25.860 --> 03:03:26.900]
Look before, goodness, baby.

[03:03:27.100 --> 03:03:29.980]
This is 516 QAS.

[03:03:33.280 --> 03:03:35.920]
George, we're radio is one of the Q's world.

[03:03:36.540 --> 03:03:36.920]
QAS.

[03:03:37.520 --> 03:03:38.140]
Thank you, Boomer.

[03:03:39.860 --> 03:03:40.300]
Oh!

[03:03:42.300 --> 03:03:43.460]
Don't it. I told you.

[03:03:43.580 --> 03:03:45.060]
Don't bother me while I'm in here.

[03:03:45.260 --> 03:03:45.620]
I, sir.

[03:03:46.460 --> 03:03:46.900]
Hello?

[03:03:47.180 --> 03:03:48.360]
It's Mickey Mouse.

[03:03:48.980 --> 03:03:50.800]
Oh, Mr. Mouse. Good morning.

[03:03:50.920 --> 03:03:51.560]
How are you?

[03:03:51.720 --> 03:03:54.400]
What the hell are you doing to me?

[03:03:55.400 --> 03:03:56.160]
Nothing, sir.

[03:03:56.340 --> 03:03:57.820]
You're freaking killing me.

[03:03:58.040 --> 03:03:58.560]
No, not.

[03:03:58.800 --> 03:04:01.220]
I know, David Kelly called me every three minutes.

[03:04:01.900 --> 03:04:03.640]
Why did we move the process?

[03:04:04.060 --> 03:04:05.640]
Sir, you told me to move the process.

[03:04:05.660 --> 03:04:06.640]
I didn't tell you.

[03:04:06.640 --> 03:04:08.360]
You must have misunderstood me.

[03:04:08.620 --> 03:04:11.480]
No, sir. You said move the practice to Monday.

[03:04:11.540 --> 03:04:13.160]
Hey, hey, listen, butt wipe.

[03:04:13.660 --> 03:04:14.180]
I'm the boss.

[03:04:14.640 --> 03:04:15.400]
I make the decisions.

[03:04:15.420 --> 03:04:16.700]
You take the heat.

[03:04:16.900 --> 03:04:17.060]
Right.

[03:04:17.400 --> 03:04:18.760]
You'll move the practice.

[03:04:19.260 --> 03:04:21.180]
How are we doing with it anyway?

[03:04:21.320 --> 03:04:22.700]
I am mad.

[03:04:22.840 --> 03:04:23.600]
Hold on.

[03:04:23.700 --> 03:04:24.320]
What do I mean?

[03:04:24.640 --> 03:04:25.120]
Remaz.

[03:04:25.840 --> 03:04:26.600]
Yeah, boss.

[03:04:26.980 --> 03:04:28.800]
Shut the hell up.

[03:04:29.100 --> 03:04:30.480]
I'm on the phone, Remaz.

[03:04:30.740 --> 03:04:31.200]
Hi, sir.

[03:04:31.560 --> 03:04:32.940]
Yes, sir. What was your question?

[03:04:33.220 --> 03:04:34.120]
I'm killing you.

[03:04:34.120 --> 03:04:40.260]
I'm going crazy over here between David Kelly and now Michael Jackson called me every three minutes.

[03:04:40.300 --> 03:04:42.560]
I'm going to go out of my freaking mind.

[03:04:43.440 --> 03:04:44.500]
Hold on.

[03:04:45.160 --> 03:04:45.480]
Remaz.

[03:04:46.180 --> 03:04:47.340]
Get in, you boss.

[03:04:47.900 --> 03:04:48.620]
Stop it, Remaz.

[03:04:49.440 --> 03:04:50.780]
I'm sorry, boss.

[03:04:51.220 --> 03:04:52.700]
Stop the phone, Remaz.

[03:04:53.660 --> 03:04:54.260]
Remaz.

[03:04:55.000 --> 03:04:56.860]
It's one thing in my hand, Remaz.

[03:04:57.140 --> 03:04:58.340]
That's your penis, boss.

[03:04:58.540 --> 03:04:59.920]
My other hand, Remaz.

[03:05:00.800 --> 03:05:02.100]
That's the phone, boss.

[03:05:02.100 --> 03:05:04.760]
Right, I can't hear anything, Remaz.

[03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:06.320]
Stop sawing the floor.

[03:05:06.600 --> 03:05:06.880]
Sorry.

[03:05:07.220 --> 03:05:07.640]
Hi, sir.

[03:05:08.240 --> 03:05:10.560]
Sir, the moves are working out very well.

[03:05:10.900 --> 03:05:13.280]
The practice is fourth and it's time for me to...

[03:05:13.280 --> 03:05:13.420]
What the fuck?

[03:05:13.760 --> 03:05:16.840]
It's time for me to even beat him to WB?

[03:05:17.240 --> 03:05:17.700]
Barely.

[03:05:17.980 --> 03:05:19.080]
Oh my god.

[03:05:19.640 --> 03:05:21.380]
Michael Jackson was a rating success.

[03:05:22.080 --> 03:05:22.440]
Of course.

[03:05:22.940 --> 03:05:24.060]
Hold on a second.

[03:05:25.060 --> 03:05:25.580]
Remaz.

[03:05:26.200 --> 03:05:26.880]
It's the book.

[03:05:28.260 --> 03:05:32.060]
What the hell are you doing with a harmonica, Remaz?

[03:05:32.940 --> 03:05:34.000]
Don't play, Remaz.

[03:05:34.260 --> 03:05:35.940]
I'll jam that thing down your throat.

[03:05:36.700 --> 03:05:38.420]
And give that blue bird away from me.

[03:05:38.660 --> 03:05:39.740]
Oh, come on, Remaz.

[03:05:40.580 --> 03:05:41.460]
I'm allergic.

[03:05:41.960 --> 03:05:42.760]
I, sir.

[03:05:43.140 --> 03:05:45.640]
Sir, over 25 million people saw...

[03:05:45.640 --> 03:05:46.320]
Shut up,izer.

[03:05:46.940 --> 03:05:47.140]
Listen.

[03:05:47.500 --> 03:05:47.620]
Yeah.

[03:05:47.880 --> 03:05:49.240]
You see me what I'm doing here?

[03:05:49.980 --> 03:05:50.980]
Sir, you're on the phone.

[03:05:51.360 --> 03:05:52.740]
I know I'm on the phone.

[03:05:52.920 --> 03:05:53.920]
Do you see what I'm doing?

[03:05:54.580 --> 03:05:56.820]
You're the human imagination for crying out loud.

[03:05:57.440 --> 03:05:59.160]
I'm moving my hands up and down.

[03:05:59.340 --> 03:05:59.840]
Slide to side.

[03:06:00.120 --> 03:06:00.960]
I'm the puppet master.

[03:06:00.960 --> 03:06:02.280]
I say it.

[03:06:02.360 --> 03:06:03.140]
You do it.

[03:06:03.340 --> 03:06:07.400]
Now Fox is going to air all the stuff that you cut out of the Michael Jackson interview.

[03:06:07.740 --> 03:06:11.200]
But, sir, you told me to edit out all that stuff to make him work.

[03:06:11.220 --> 03:06:12.480]
That's it, that's it, that's it.

[03:06:12.780 --> 03:06:13.480]
Puppet master.

[03:06:14.200 --> 03:06:14.500]
Me.

[03:06:16.480 --> 03:06:16.920]
He...

[03:06:16.920 --> 03:06:17.300]
Oh.

[03:06:19.500 --> 03:06:19.940]
Remaz.

[03:06:22.260 --> 03:06:22.700]
Remaz.

[03:06:22.920 --> 03:06:23.720]
Yes, he able.

[03:06:24.060 --> 03:06:25.740]
What the hell are you doing now?

[03:06:26.240 --> 03:06:27.160]
Listen to the flow, folks.

[03:06:27.360 --> 03:06:29.080]
It's nothing wrong with the floor, Remaz.

[03:06:29.260 --> 03:06:30.200]
What's this in my ear?

[03:06:30.540 --> 03:06:30.940]
That's your...

[03:06:30.940 --> 03:06:30.940]

[03:06:30.940 --> 03:06:30.940]

[03:06:30.940 --> 03:06:30.940]

[03:06:30.940 --> 03:06:30.940]

[03:06:30.940 --> 03:06:33.420]
Oh, Pete is both my other ear, Remaz.

[03:06:33.720 --> 03:06:35.320]
Oh, that's the phone, boss.

[03:06:35.320 --> 03:06:36.500]
That's the phone, Remaz.

[03:06:36.680 --> 03:06:37.020]
Get out.

[03:06:37.320 --> 03:06:38.240]
Get over to work.

[03:06:38.440 --> 03:06:38.940]
Get off.

[03:06:39.420 --> 03:06:40.060]
I, sir.

[03:06:40.280 --> 03:06:40.640]
Yes, sir.

[03:06:40.780 --> 03:06:41.220]
Killin' me.

[03:06:42.080 --> 03:06:42.800]
Killin' me.

[03:06:43.020 --> 03:06:43.800]
I'm sorry, sir.

[03:06:44.060 --> 03:06:44.880]
Killin' me.

[03:06:45.300 --> 03:06:45.620]
Sorry.

[03:06:45.960 --> 03:06:47.020]
Killin' me softly.

[03:06:48.140 --> 03:06:51.920]
Hey, listen, I was like a special bonus today because it's been such a great show, don't you think?

[03:06:52.280 --> 03:06:52.600]
It hasn't.

[03:06:52.860 --> 03:06:53.780]
It hasn't been fan...

[03:06:53.780 --> 03:06:54.740]
Fan tabulous.

[03:06:55.100 --> 03:06:56.120]
Especially the guy with the...

[03:06:56.120 --> 03:06:56.740]
Getski.

[03:06:57.420 --> 03:06:58.060]
Okay, let's see.

[03:06:58.120 --> 03:06:59.220]
Here's the final totals.

[03:06:59.620 --> 03:07:03.680]
Here's our totals from what that was her name, that little mix of the used to work at Iondi.

[03:07:03.940 --> 03:07:04.260]
Halcyon.

[03:07:04.340 --> 03:07:04.620]
Halcyon, how could you do that?

[03:07:04.740 --> 03:07:05.320]
Halcyon, Frigga.

[03:07:05.320 --> 03:07:06.080]
Those were the Halcyon.

[03:07:06.200 --> 03:07:08.500]
Those were the salad days, baby.

[03:07:08.960 --> 03:07:12.120]
That's when Marshaler used to bring the shallots with all the marshmallows and the fruit.

[03:07:12.460 --> 03:07:13.260]
Yes, the Enbrote Day.

[03:07:13.400 --> 03:07:13.640]
And the baby.

[03:07:15.800 --> 03:07:16.400]
525 volts.

[03:07:16.520 --> 03:07:17.920]
We're trying to figure this thing out here, man.

[03:07:17.960 --> 03:07:18.660]
We can't figure it out.

[03:07:18.780 --> 03:07:24.800]
Even Josh Cortis, who were nearly just a mild-mannered mind-to-zone binist, even he was shocked and dismayed by the...

[03:07:24.800 --> 03:07:28.320]
Not by the hour itself, not by the programming, but by the spot load.

[03:07:30.180 --> 03:07:31.740]
I couldn't believe it.

[03:07:31.740 --> 03:07:32.800]
I mean, that was just scary.

[03:07:33.820 --> 03:07:38.600]
But then again, these guys, once they get their feet wet, once they take off their goulashes and get their feet wet,

[03:07:38.700 --> 03:07:40.960]
then we really will love you in deep crap.

[03:07:41.400 --> 03:07:43.900]
Who should get the permanent 2-4 pm slot, I can't wait.

[03:07:44.060 --> 03:07:46.480]
Because now we've got this revolving thing we keep putting Gildi.

[03:07:46.720 --> 03:07:49.040]
Gildi's on again today, standing by the Iyenta Center.

[03:07:49.400 --> 03:07:51.680]
Oh my god, with all the respect, Gildi.

[03:07:52.160 --> 03:07:53.860]
And then of course the Panthers, they're done.

[03:07:54.020 --> 03:07:54.840]
Don't believe those promos.

[03:07:55.000 --> 03:07:56.380]
It's Sidney Crosby, by the way.

[03:07:56.480 --> 03:07:59.360]
There are people who prefer to win Sid the Kid, okay?

[03:07:59.620 --> 03:08:04.400]
But not Sid. Nobody calls him Sid, except in that stupid promo, which is another reason that nobody shows up.

[03:08:04.840 --> 03:08:06.660]
I'll tell you one thing, at least Bruins Game last night.

[03:08:06.660 --> 03:08:12.000]
There must have been at least 60 people at that game, and if I show thousands of people, this guy's as empty yellow seats.

[03:08:12.400 --> 03:08:15.400]
Always a good idea in the arena where you don't draw well to have yellow seats.

[03:08:15.960 --> 03:08:19.820]
Who should get the permanent 2-4 slot on QAIM when we finally make up our mind?

[03:08:19.820 --> 03:08:22.000]
You remember that song by Love and Spoonful and John Sebastian?

[03:08:22.380 --> 03:08:23.860]
Did you ever have to make up your mind?

[03:08:23.900 --> 03:08:24.740]
I bet you got that in there.

[03:08:24.740 --> 03:08:26.560]
I do, but I had to try to find out.

[03:08:26.800 --> 03:08:27.520]
I already should have done that.

[03:08:27.660 --> 03:08:30.380]
Oh geez, just like the phone thing I shut down up on there too.

[03:08:30.600 --> 03:08:32.280]
Because I could have squeezed another quick call or two.

[03:08:32.720 --> 03:08:33.780]
Suds call him in 99.

[03:08:34.480 --> 03:08:35.240]
You ready for that?

[03:08:35.520 --> 03:08:36.200]
Not gonna happen.

[03:08:36.620 --> 03:08:37.620]
Great guy, we love him.

[03:08:37.960 --> 03:08:38.680]
Mad Dog 93.

[03:08:39.340 --> 03:08:39.820]
Pretty tight.

[03:08:40.100 --> 03:08:41.180]
Out of 500 and some odd.

[03:08:41.460 --> 03:08:44.860]
If you're a drug addict, you get 74, you're moving up, you're sliding up there, ever so, you know.

[03:08:45.100 --> 03:08:46.160]
Holy but surely out.

[03:08:46.580 --> 03:08:47.320]
Yeah, look out now.

[03:08:47.520 --> 03:08:48.120]
My, my, my.

[03:08:48.120 --> 03:08:49.420]
Was that really Gilbert?

[03:08:49.860 --> 03:08:49.980]
Yes.

[03:08:50.420 --> 03:08:51.200]
Oh god.

[03:08:51.460 --> 03:08:52.580]
I won't listen anyway 62.

[03:08:53.080 --> 03:08:53.860]
Kurt, how about Gilbert?

[03:08:54.180 --> 03:08:55.020]
Let's put Gilbert on there.

[03:08:55.080 --> 03:08:55.780]
Come on.

[03:08:56.700 --> 03:08:58.100]
He could sure do better than Mo did.

[03:08:58.420 --> 03:08:59.140]
Kurt is 45.

[03:08:59.320 --> 03:09:00.000]
Bring back more 39.

[03:09:00.200 --> 03:09:00.900]
The big old 29.

[03:09:01.280 --> 03:09:02.240]
Kimba Volkamp are 19.

[03:09:02.580 --> 03:09:03.400]
Reverend Jones 16.

[03:09:03.800 --> 03:09:05.560]
Giali Solomon take Caterseh man 14.

[03:09:06.000 --> 03:09:06.840]
Not too strong Giali.

[03:09:07.080 --> 03:09:07.700]
The Crow 13.

[03:09:07.720 --> 03:09:08.600]
I hit this full nine.

[03:09:08.740 --> 03:09:10.160]
Joe Zagaki ate Ernie Sochin for.

[03:09:10.520 --> 03:09:12.660]
And Lenny Martez still stuck on three.

[03:09:12.700 --> 03:09:13.440]
Bye, bye, bye.
