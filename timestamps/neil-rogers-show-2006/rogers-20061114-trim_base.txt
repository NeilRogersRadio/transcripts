[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500]
Yeah, well, he's not very good. He sucks. He has nothing to the telecast nothing zero

[00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.660]
Let's have 40 people in the booth. What do you say? That was really good early in the game when they had the a mask

[00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.260]
Cargoyeon or whoever the hell I was

[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.340]
They're like they have all jammed in their squeeze into the booth

[00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.380]
Papa and Joe Joe a thysman. I don't give a crap if he's the driving race cars

[00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.620]
I wish you would drive into the wall and kill himself. Yeah, shut him up already. I need to shut him up. Please Jesus

[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.940]
He's just out of control. He thinks the whole telecast we tune in to see about him

[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.560]
Not the game, you know, although quite frankly

[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.680]
Walden Merck Arkansas Randy Wooten figured he'd get at least one vote in his bid for mayor of this town of 80 people even was just his own vote

[00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.960]
He did not now

[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.280]
He has to decide whether to file a formal protest Wooten got the news from his wife Roxanne and went to city hall on Wednesday to see the election results

[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.720]
If he saw my name with zero votes next to which he came home asked me if I voted for myself or not

[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.620]
I said I did said Wooten's owner of a local bar

[00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.940]
However, points of County results before to Wednesday showing incumbent away to mage wood with 18 votes

[00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.800]
Challenger Ronnie Chapman with 18 votes and Wooten with the big oh zero

[00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.060]
I had at least eight or nine people that said they voted for me. So something's wrong with this picture Wooten said

[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.460]
Points said County Election Commissioner John away pain John away

[00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.940]
Said the issue of been discussed the no action taking it. It's our understanding from talking with the Secretary of State's office

[00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.900]
That a quarter to would have to be obtained or to open the machine and check the total

[00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.560]
She said the votes were cast on electronic voting machine, but paper ballots were available

[00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.160]
How do you like that he voted for himself and eight or nine of his buddies voted for him and he got a big nothing

[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.040]
Zip it. He do not not that there's any hanky spanking goes out with election with machines stuff like that right

[00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.600]
Well, we're back up on our first we're streaming it again

[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.660]
We apologize to that if you just tuned it online. We're sorry all the tenia. We said we'll be sorry and

[00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:57.320]

[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.620]
Kenny and Vomorning show until it goes off the year in a few weeks

[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.460]
Here's the yesterday's poll result. What's your take on these poll? I mean they're doing everything they can to sabotage them

[00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.220]
There's sandbagging. I mean as Kenny we do that stupid or what seems like a decent guy

[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.700]
But he must be stupid. Seems like a very nice guy. Maybe he's been in radio too long and effective his brain

[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.920]
I

[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.000]
Mean they're just leading him down to garden path although he does sound very intuitive

[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.520]
Must be a good actor because he sends very enthusiastic about all Drew Rosenhouse. He's a monster. He's a jackass

[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.380]
1436 votes. What's your take on these polls we asked yesterday?

[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.300]
They're fine and that commits to me. We just continue plowing right ahead. I'm running upward to inward outward in and out

[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.100]
1075 votes for their fine almost 75%

[00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.520]
Once a week is good on the poll 155. That's what George and I think once a week. What's a month? Sure? What's a year?

[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:55.240]
I hate this poll 78 only 5.4 percent. That's not bad the polls suck. They suck 66 year rid of the 62 not the really big

[00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.360]
Negatory when you got 75% say they're fine. What's the big cynus already huh? They don't even know what that mean

[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.000]
What's the stimulus with the polls?

[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.000]
What is your girlfriend Hillary again?

[00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.800]

[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.840]
Let me know when your sales manager comes in response to that question. Okay. He he just stone walls. He's an evil doer

[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.300]
Just like Josh just said that nothing could be fired and lose to Carolina and they did last night his bucks and the this guy's a loser from Carolina

[00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.140]
172 votes who's the biggest pony of them all and by the way Joe Bell we don't do any best of meal tapes okay

[00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.420]
You know mark fully who does mark fully?

[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.460]
We got bigger face to fry. We got a gay government. We're like a Charlie Christ with limperist

So anyway, that's our poll for today and like it or not and we're screaming everything's fine

I mean, Bo we are with knows a good guy. We like him a lot. All of these in dollars. He's a good guy

[00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:27.160]
He's you know, he's obviously helping twist the arms because he's part of that sports fraternity if not a sports show

[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.120]
There wouldn't be much point heaven him on there with there

[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:38.080]
Anyway, oh, I'm not talking to myself. I don't know an honest response from you because you talk up a storm before the show off the year

[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.060]

[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:52.280]

[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.660]
They got mad about died and died anyway

[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:09.900]
How about that rich? You know that was your job. No, I was already done done talking to people about their weight by that

[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:11.940]
Yeah, I tried with him to it

[00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:16.000]
It's nice to at the track. I tell him we don't want any rules on the table because you know

[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.700]
I get there early and they just get mad at you and residing tell them to take the rules off

[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:25.780]
And then he would reach back and take the up he would take the thing of rules off the table behind us before the other people would show up

[00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:31.380]
And he started shoveling down. I'm sure you reached for rules all the time now, but you don't have far to reach

[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.960]
CNN is reporting that Senator Mel Martinez one of the most

[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:42.460]
Unconscious subhuman pieces of terror to ever dropped on the earth has been picked by President Bush to handle Republican National Committee

[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.440]
Martinez a Cuban-born Senator elected in 2004's ace

[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:50.040]
He is staunchly conservative on most social issues to say the least

[00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:57.100]
The Senator has been the target of an FEC investigation in the under reporting a campaign that by half a million dollars and another FEC

[00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.700]
Complaint regarding a proper solicitation of corporate donations

[00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:05.380]
That's your senator Mel Martinez who named ends in a Z and it's the only reason he got elected is because he's a bigot in his name

[00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:12.820]
Ends in a Z his chief legal counsel resigned early last year after became known that Martinez was responsible for the Terry Shabo talking points

[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:18.780]
Circulated among Republicans all at Simmons about Terry Andrew shoe that was him behind all that crap and of course

[00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:19.940]
What can I say?

[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:22.440]
Love another 29 votes on the pool

[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:30.280]
We got the 760 friends in my space on our my space page

[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:34.780]
Mm-hmm, which Josh is for an ancient out of touch bang like me is pretty good. That is good

[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:38.340]
The online social networking phenomenon my space has come under fire

[00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:43.180]
For allowing death row inmates to maintain personal profiles on the hugely popular site

[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.620]
At least 30

[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:52.040]
There's a waiting execution in Texas have pages on my space which is used by millions of teenagers around the world of socialize

[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:57.960]
Make friends are a 760 people are not teenagers. I don't think I don't know if any of them are I haven't checked all those things out

[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.580]
I don't think they are some of them are they?

[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.700]
We have teenagers listening to this show. Yes, you do well

[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:07.560]
They must be interested in what's going on in the world or maybe they just have very six cents a humor both

[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:13.180]
Both of the above sure groups working with crime victims have demanded that the website my space

[00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:17.500]
Which is owned by Rupert Murdoch's news corporation removes these prisoners?

[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:24.120]
The profiles list the inmates hobbies and personalities and some include blogs in which prisoners relate today

[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:28.740]
They doings on death row their favorite music and films even the crimes that were convicted of

[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:34.300]
As prisoners are not allowed internet access the profiles are created managed for them by friends and relatives

[00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.720]
We see prisoners updates in the form of letters

[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:42.360]
I think you ought to draw the line somewhere as an NDK hand director of an office at works with crime victims

[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:49.140]
He has written to my space asking the site to reconsider having pages created and maintained for convicted criminals especially murderers

[00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:50.800]
You know somewhere out there in the city

[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:53.300]
There's a murderer on the loose

[00:15:55.540 --> 00:16:00.200]
Do the right thing turn yourselves in right now do it

[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:06.700]
Is it within your policy to allow that I just I'm sorry. I just I can't have a break

[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:11.700]
Down from that show I'm just I'm gonna have a nervous breakdown. It's a good thing we're not playing those long-ponderous promos anymore

[00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.920]
You know no more promos for the home. Oh

[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:19.640]
Is it within your policy to rely the glorification of killers by giving them a platform to influence young minds mr

[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:25.220]
Can wrote are the specific guidelines within my space they would prohibit giving convicted felons a platform for all the world

[00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.520]
Let's see question mark. Uh-huh

[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:33.020]
My space has yet to be spined was request the profiles are similar to other pages on the site containing photos

[00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:37.560]
Many showing the inmates in their prison uniforms and messages from their my space friends

[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:42.260]
One inmate Randy Halperin 29 who was involved in the death of a police officer rights

[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:47.920]
I think I'm a pretty funny guy. I have a wax sense of humor. I can be a big kid at heart. I'm a hopeless and I mean hopeless

[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:51.100]
Romantic he said yeah, he's hopeless

[00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:53.880]
Somewhere out there. There's a you know

[00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:56.460]
Hopeless murderer on the loose

[00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:59.000]
Somewhere out there somebody knows something

[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.300]
I'll I will say this if they went to you in or they do go to you and they don't know much

[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:07.960]
If that's where they get into education and I use the term very loosely. They don't know too much believe me when I tell you

[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.620]
You believe me no you can't spell scum without you in

[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.380]
That's how much a lady boy. She's got a real sense of humor

[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:21.300]

[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:47.720]

[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:51.800]

The only if they heard me read that story yesterday about his big crack problem and spent a two grand a month on crack cocaine

[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:29.420]
While he's a chance to ask anybody else about doing drugs and this and that all the people that tell you don't do this and don't do that

[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:34.020]
You want to know why cuz they're doing it. That's right. It's just like the Catholic church all this business about the

[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:38.700]
Gate pride parade and which they canceled by the way as you're roostle and did they they don't want you messing with those

[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.160]
Fags because they they want the dibs

[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.580]
Expressing the good looking ones like the switch guard guard the bounty 130

[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:50.780]
I hit this pool only 28 2.4% and Nancy Grace we put her on there and Nancy so far has got the

[00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:54.540]
And richly deserves the biggest name so best talent

[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.200]
For 205 60

For David's a bitch

[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.080]
Oh

[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:22.140]
You can mention you can drop it you can squeeze it you can fly by that the pot

[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:27.300]
You can throw it you can throw it you can even roll it and the pot

[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.400]
You can really come to a struggle you can come and at the pot

[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.180]
Let's go to the pot

[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:43.980]
There's go to the pot

[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.980]
But you can take a tampon people push the chill stuff down at the pot

[00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:58.160]
And you can jump your go and when they're getting off it's down in the pot

[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:03.240]
You can lose the evidence when the cops are breaking in that at the pot

[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:04.460]
Where

[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.640]
There go to the pot

[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:16.240]
Ah

[00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:27.220]
Let's get on the end of this team

[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.080]
1032 28 to a load of 560 WQM happy Tuesday

[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:38.580]
Tuesday to you I think you know we took this pool once before but they hadn't really been on that line

[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:42.480]
Wasn't fear the Kenny and both take a you know survey on the morning show how the audience likes it

[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.240]
Okay, now they've been on for a while

[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:50.060]
And I'm thinking maybe for tomorrow we'll take a poll and ask him what their take is on the Kenny and Bull morning show with just one choice

[00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:51.680]
Way too much sports

[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.500]
I'm just thinking out loud. I'm not gonna do that

[00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:57.360]
Just something for me to think about

[00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:03.720]
Because I get angry about it. I just to get angry or angry or more and more epistop but nevertheless

[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:05.420]
We're doing okay

[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:13.000]
Yeah immigrants arrested in the US may be held indefinitely on suspicion of terrorism and may not challenge their imprisonment and civilian courts

[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.200]
The Bush administration city as they opening a new legal fund to the fight over the rights of detainees

[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.100]
Which of course the Bush people so they don't have any

[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.120]
They ain't got no rights

[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:25.820]
In court documents filed with a fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia

[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:30.620]
The Justice Department said a new anti-terrorism lobbying used to hold detainees and getmo

[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:37.440]
Also applies to foreigners captured and held in the US like you know if they just have to get off a plane from like Amsterdam or somewhere like that. Yeah like

[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:45.020]
Ali salak halal marri a citizen of gutter was arrested in 2000 more while studying in the USA

[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:52.260]
He's been labeled as an enemy combatant a designation that under the law signed last month strips foreigners of the right to challenge their detention in a federal courts

[00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:55.740]
That law is being used to argue that the getmo cases

[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:59.800]
But al-Mari represents the first detainee inside the U.S. to come under the new law

[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:07.460]
Aliens normally have the right to contest their imprisonment sets us when they're arrested on immigration violations or for other crimes like Georgia is going to be very soon

[00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:08.840]
Right for being in legal alien

[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:15.980]
It's pretty stunning that any alien living in the U.S. can be denied this rights of Jonathan Hoffitz and attorney for al-Mari

[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:21.920]
It means any non-citizen in there are millions of them can be wished off at night and be put in detention just kind of like disappear, you know

[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.740]
This vanish in the thin air

[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:32.680]
The new law says the enemy combatants will be tried before military commissions not a civilian judge or jury and establishes different rules of evidence in the cases

[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:36.960]
It also prohibits detainees from challenging their detention in civilian court

[00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:43.560]
In a separate court farming in Washington yesterday the justice department defended their law as constitutional and necessary

[00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:50.020]
That's that Nazi that little Alberto v. O five Gonzalez. He's probably doing something with the malmartinus

[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:55.260]
The government attorney said foreign fighter. You know what I mean by doing something no what yeah

[00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:59.840]
Yes, in detail government attorney said foreign fighters arrested as part of an overseas military action

[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:03.180]
They have no constitutional rights and are being afforded more legal rights than ever

[00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:08.520]
In its short farming in the al-Mari case the justice department doesn't mention that al-Mari is being held

[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:14.280]
The military prison in South Carolina a fact that as attorney say affords in the same rights as anybody else being held in the U.S.

[00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:22.640]
The justice department noted only that the new law applies to all enemy combatants regardless of the location of the detention the Bush administration maintains

[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:29.820]
That al-Mari is now kind of sleeper agent the defense department already review of al-Mari status and enemy combatant

[00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:36.200]
To be conducted if as requested the case is thrown out of court. Oh boy. He's a sleeper agent. Maybe he's a sleeper

[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:41.040]
Wonder for the alin was about that wasn't that his movie sleepers? Yes, it was

[00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:46.140]
It's too everybody for papers though. It was funny. Yeah, one of his two funny movies if you ask me

[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:51.140]
Now can you believe that he did the mass point? I do believe it

[00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:57.120]
He's been guilty of making good movies in the past despite the fact that he makes our isn't gonna be all yeah, yeah, he's a nebitch

[00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:04.140]
1177 or there's your anti-Samanthusism acting up again. That's what it is. He's done. He was like some

[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.040]
atheist. Oh, by the way

[00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:12.300]
Ising thing they had there on city confidential about Madeline O'Hare and her retarded son. They're all still dead by the way

[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.660]
Like I'm all on well. I used to have her on a lot

[00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:19.380]
Back in the back of the day. I wish you didn't even know that. Did you yeah, you told me

[00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:24.960]
Had her on a show actually in the studio. We had like a widen the seat a little bit boy. She was a big big old lady

[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:30.660]
She had the big pair out to do that now. What's your thinking of either? What am I thinking? She had big balls. I know

[00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:33.580]
She would read and of course on the phone

[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.740]
Here's a little piece of interesting trivia which I'm sure he didn't know

[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:40.220]
The day I decided never to have any more guests on a show

[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:44.280]
It was a Saturday morning. That's right. I was working Monday through Saturday

[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.200]
And Saturday I was doing mid-days at INZ 10 to 2 and then Saturday morning. I do like after you win

[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.500]
But early. I don't know when maybe we were sent to

[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:58.920]
And she was supposed to be my guest on the phone on that Saturday whenever the hell was probably 87 86 and like that

[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.680]
And uh, I got an inspiration

[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:05.700]
I thought you know, I've talked to her 80 million times already and she's great. She was a great guest. You know for the big mouth

[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:11.940]
But uh, well, what's the point? You know guest as it's narrow casting again just like this thing with your rosin house

[00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:14.200]
It just makes me it may very angry, you know

[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.620]
Makes me very very angry

[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.360]
Because nobody will listen to me. What the hell could I possibly know?

[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:26.460]
Narrow casting today. We're gonna talk about baseball cards anybody out there doesn't care about baseball cards

[00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:30.080]
Hey, we'll see tomorrow. Maybe hopefully you'll come back. Can I like that? Like that?

[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:34.420]
Mm-hmm. Remember Mr. Ego used to do those shows on baseball cards because he had his uh

[00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:37.080]
Crap going in fact, I remember one day he came to work late

[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:42.180]
Because he had a flat tar on his way back from the baseball card show. Remember that at IOD? No

[00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:48.400]
Now you weren't wasn't he doing afternoons when you were on or weren't working out? Yeah, he was but uh, I was a rover

[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:53.740]
So I was not necessarily working on that show, you know, you're right roving over night weekends that kind of

[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:57.560]
For people while one day he didn't happen to show up a little bit late

[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:02.280]
Because he had a flat tire coming of course he could have been coming from home

[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:05.220]
I had a flat tire, but he was coming from some baseball cards show

[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:07.740]
You know when you're working at two o'clock in the afternoon

[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:11.000]
That's not a good time to be shown up late. I can understand if you're doing a morning show

[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.920]
You know you need to be in there like at 5 30 in the morning and you'll restleep. I can understand that

[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:20.520]
Or if you're gonna be doing a show that starts at 10 o'clock in the morning like Marvin raw man couldn't show up on time

[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:23.640]

After feathers suggested that he cover the controversial stickers. He recalled he went ballistic

[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:06.780]
He got in my face and started calling me a baby killer and said if I wanted to bumper stickers covered cover them myself

[00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:11.200]
Cover them with my correct. Oh man. Ask maybe it doesn't say that but I'm thinking that's what he's thinking

[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:16.080]
I asked whether we call feathers of baby killer Kordosky replied of course he is a baby killer

[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:17.540]
That's my first amendment right

[00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:20.300]
He maintained that feathers should not have asked him to move his car

[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:24.700]
I didn't know when he refused to cover the stickers on the car with the flat tire. She started screaming

According to feathers Kordosky asked for her name and occupation and called her stupid

[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:37.900]
I never screamed. I told him this was an inappropriate conversation to have at the polling place

He told me to go to hell she told roster it sounds like one of good religion's fundamentalist Christians doesn't it go to a full of

I replied that he was obviously not a religious man since he told me to go to hell

[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:51.560]
He reported I should burn in hell and get off his property immediately go that I was trespassing

[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:54.280]
At that point he shoved me pushing me backwards

[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:58.580]
After she insisted she had a right to vote in the polling place Kordosky told her she couldn't enter his home

[00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:00.580]
And then he would let me vote outside she added

[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:03.380]
Kordosky denies pushing or touching feathers

[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:07.000]
He also denies that he tried to prevent her from entering the polling place

[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.160]
I didn't spend eight years at the University of California in the medical dental biological field

[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:14.780]
It'd be an idiot if the my age of 74 said Kordosky a retired dentist

[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:17.440]
He likes drilling them

[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:22.500]
But Robert Edo a holder who witnessed the loud verbal exchange confirmed that Kordosky initially refused to allow for this to vote

[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:25.420]
He told her to leave that's what I thought was appalling in fact

[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:27.640]
He pointed her and said you can't come into my house

[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:31.680]
Then he pointed to people behind her and said you people can come in and she can

[00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:38.400]
Kordosky got in her face and told feathers you can go to hell recalled either way Republican ones are real estate development company

[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:46.240]
A third generation Japanese American whose father was a war hero during WW2 Edo said he respected feathers for speaking out

[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.520]
I wonder he's kind of judge Edo

[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:52.240]
He respected feathers for speaking out about something that I think is not legal

[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:54.260]
Regardless of one's personal views on abortion

[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:56.460]
Edo didn't recall seeing Kordosky push feathers

[00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:59.820]
Asked if he would have felt intimidated by Kordosky's behavior high ever he said

[00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:01.240]
Abso absolutely

[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:07.700]
Under California election code intimidation of voters is a pony both Kordosky and feathers

[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:11.200]
Recall that a line of approximately a dozen voters waiting outside to pull witness the

[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:13.840]
Audrication that the pulling place opened 10 to 15 minutes late

[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:19.200]
During this whole time no one had come to my defense and a few people in line started heckling me as well said feathers

[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:23.200]
Who called the register of voters or kiss on her cell phone they told me to call a police

[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:26.860]
Then a gentleman further behind me spoke up and said I had to write to vote

[00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:30.040]
That was them white and one it is it was whatever color he was

[00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:36.100]
Edo urged that the pulling place be opened inside both Edo and feathers noted that at least one voting machine was positioned

[00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.120]
So that the voters privacy was not protected from onlookers

[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:43.380]
I would have felt uncomfortable city. Do it's like going into a bathroom that doesn't have any stalls

[00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:44.980]
Why haven't some of those?

[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:50.560]
Lindemiller at the registrar's office declined to provide names of other voters

[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:54.680]
It's kind of hard to build glory holes though. No, I know what you do then

[00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:56.940]
Whatever you can

[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:03.740]
Fathers had planned to ask for a paper ballot because she mistrusted the dive old electronic voting machines

[00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:07.240]
But she noted since I was afraid that kredoski would disturb my paper ballot

[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:13.360]
I opted to use a touchscreen machine. She touched it one of the approximately five touch screens broke down when the first voter was using it

[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:17.800]
None of the machines had privacy screens. We're like sitting in going into a bathroom. We didn't have any stalls

[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:24.220]
I'd like to have a batter with those stalls there at QIM. Oh my god. So thank you. Don't go grow out

[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:30.100]
If it don't splatter what's the matter? That's what fat for you to say

[00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:33.360]
Oh my god. What a what a place

[00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:39.680]
What a place and so Joe Bell says hey next time you come in a town you're gonna combine see us and uh, you know like that

[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:41.460]
12

[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:45.720]
130 votes 12 30 that's the W. What is it? Which one was that?

[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.120]
Called her that was evident JNO in West Palm

[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:51.800]
Was 12 30 of course now the chief channel has moved them all over the world

[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:55.240]
We got JNO and JNA and JNU and J.E.W. and whatever

[00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:00.160]
Jewelry so I have no idea but that's what that was 12 30 was W to JNO

[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.040]
not great

[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:06.500]
Okay, and at nighttime our signal was so good that you could almost hear it all the way across the lake right across the street

[00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:07.180]
So

[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:16.440]
This is the new Roger show

[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:19.160]
This is your brain

[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:22.100]
Any questions?

[00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:36.040]
I am here she she she has no idea where together

[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:42.780]
I see clear through to where me I see a vice

[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.160]
I'm flying

[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:49.080]
Sitting on a milk craze

[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.320]
I'm in that the first time comes

[00:40:55.380 --> 00:41:01.500]
Maybe she's a part me taking off the garments that I've been up ahead of life to money is down

[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:07.720]
I am a freshman and I'm a dress man

[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.480]
They are enormous

[00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:12.540]
A rattle case

[00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:19.920]
Waiting for my thing to harden looking for job bus

[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:25.520]
If a prize on charity for a bizarre before sucks you rain

[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:31.820]
I am a freshman take off your dress man

[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:36.540]
They are enormous look at the blue look at the blue

[00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:44.300]
And sexy take it while the frowns is don't you think the struggle looks for you

[00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:50.540]
See how they hear like your bags of leaves with twisted eyes

[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:53.060]
I'm rising

[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:56.820]
That's sugar since you're all dressed

[00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:00.780]
Jammy ever say for high

[00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:04.100]
You know

[00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:07.560]
She will be approaching I'm about to see it the Roger

[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:10.800]
Such a

[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.620]
I am a

[00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:14.900]
Just man

[00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:17.620]
I need a full rush

[00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:21.340]
I don't understand a word in that video

[00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:25.500]
You know let it go to what that's probably just as one

[00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:28.560]
Love it 0-2 at 560 WQ I'm happy Tuesday to you

[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:33.900]
We got mad dog at two then that power hour then the Humper five to seven hurricane warm up. We got hurricane basketball

[00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:37.800]
Now was that came a home game or is that an Alcorn state?

[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:40.860]
I know if you put a gun to my head I couldn't anywhere Alcorn state is

[00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:45.100]
I may have heard of it but where is Alcorn state, John? I don't know

[00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:48.740]
I would get shot in the head too but if you put it into my head you couldn't make me care

[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:51.920]
Alcorn state

[00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:54.880]
I'm good with it

[00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.360]
It's outside warm in Mississippi

[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:01.120]
Oh

[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:04.560]
And it's a treat to beat your feet on the Mississippi mud

[00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:10.800]
That's what Karen said that's when you think he did me off to is it a home game or what we don't know

[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:14.180]
And we don't care do you think anybody else cares? I'll tell you one thing

[00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:16.540]
You can't complain about the crowd if the uh

[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:20.520]
Panthers capitals crap on game last night which the panthers lost by the way 4-1

[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:23.460]
You can't complain about that crowd because it wasn't any or nobody there

[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:27.460]
I saw a little bit of that game. I was enough to make you a grown man cry

[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:33.440]
Want to sit down and put your head in your hand and just cry like an epitome just play was nobody's doing put in his head in his hands and crying

[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:39.160]
Oh, here's the now this is the article I wanted this is it

[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:43.180]
And why did I why do you let me be that other one of the bastard?

[00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:46.680]
You are James Carroll and the Boston Globe

[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:52.220]
War religion and gay rights it was out our websites and maybe five or ten year reddit already but probably not

[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:57.400]
He says in Jerusalem Muslims in juzufam common cause attacking gay people

[00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:01.240]
A gay pride parade was scheduled for friday in Palestinian areas

[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:05.560]
Muslim leaders vigorously condemned homosexuality as criminal and in ultra-orthodox

[00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:10.200]
neighborhoods Jewish demonstrator stage raucous protest raucous

[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:16.260]
As the result organizes cancel the parade one of them said now we're being dragged back into the dark world of religion

[00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:22.000]
Like I just read only moments ago in US elections last week while a wave of change was reversing the nation's conservative direction

[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.980]
A counterwave press admit to attack gays

[00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:29.660]
On the ballot in eight states were amendments to finding marriages between a man and a woman a direct

[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:34.040]
Compniation of the right of homosexual couples to marry instead of those states the amendment passed

[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:41.520]
One of those was Colorado where a leader of the anti-game marriage movement pastor Ted Hagrid you fairy had the week before been forced out of his position

[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:45.700]
Instead of new life friction color or springs because of an alleged relationship with a male prostitute

[00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:50.060]
Who an apostatuta in his resignation letter Hagrid confessed

[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:51.500]
I'm a deceiver and a liar

[00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:56.200]
There's a part of my life that is so repulsed in the dark that have been worrying against it all my adult life

[00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:59.160]
Don't listen to a story about a preacher named

[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:06.520]
In Massachusetts at last week's constitutional convention they come almost four Catholic bishops took a rare political initiative calling on Catholics to

[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:10.140]
Prejuder pressure legislators to support an anti-game marriage amendment here

[00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:13.040]
The convention recess without taking action

[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:19.740]
But the bishops had demonstrated the absolute priority of rolling back the rights of gays to marry when public crises are defined by an immoral american war

[00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:21.980]
Universal cuts and social services

[00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:28.320]
Violence among young people resurgent nuclear arsenals rising global inequity on president and jeopardy of the earth itself

[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:31.020]
Why are the bishops obsessed with this particular question

[00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:37.360]
Same sexy radical up is not the issue humans including Catholic bishops have longer accommodated it

[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.580]
But that accommodation assumes denial and shame

[00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:44.480]
When phrase demonstrators in the streets across cultures and what shows up in the west's values politics

[00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:51.520]
Mobilizing bishops is the movement to bring homosexuality out of the dark when gay people openly assert their identities as such whether through

[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:53.900]
Parades or through the demand for full and equal social recognition

[00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:56.220]
Reactionaries can't stand it why

[00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:59.040]
Two answers one personal and one political

[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:04.980]
The open affirmation of gay identity can pose a mortal threat to people whose own sexual identity is insecure

[00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:07.420]
The Hagridster is a cautionary tale

[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:13.520]
As it happens I was present last year to hear pastor Ted preach a sermon at his mega church and an included a

[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:17.420]
Aggressive attack on homosexuals that was as venomous as it was gratuitous

[00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:19.460]
He included gay sex with bestiality

[00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:25.620]
Even at the time I wondered about the dark energy of his hatred that is revealed now itself hatred comes in no surprise

[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:30.100]
One need and draw a direct line from Hygrids behavior to the private morality of Catholic bishops

[00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:33.900]
The sense that the church's own deepening insecurity in all matters of sexuality

[00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:38.040]
Especially those surfaced by the still unresolved prices of priestly sexual abuse and children

[00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:42.320]
Informs its exceptional opposition to gay rights and so in Jerusalem

[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:49.680]
The insecurities of the male establishment so dominance over women is threatened readily explored and content for any expression of gay pride

[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.000]
patriarchy is an issue

[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:56.640]
There's a deflection here in that point to the political use of gay bashing at the end of the Cold War when the Pentagon

[00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:03.580]
Defined itself as the world's largest closet by decreeing don't ask don't tell the issue of gay's in the military was being used to deflect attention

[00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:10.120]
From the military's real problem how to maintain Cold War levels of spending and a Cold War nuclear arsenal without a Cold War enemy

[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:15.540]
The real don't ask don't tell was don't ask us about our budgets and nukes and we won't tell you about the future wars

[00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:21.740]
They'll enable all of the sturm and drang about gazing the military deflected American attention from the real issue of the moment and it worked

[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:24.400]
the American Cold War ethos is still with us

[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:31.760]
The human race is undergoing a massive cultural mutation the meaning of sexuality is being transformed as biology revolutionizes reproduction

[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:34.380]
Women are demanding equality across the globe

[00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:38.500]
Men are being forced to reimagine their famed familiar and the social roles

[00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:45.260]
Gaze and lesbians are at the center of these changes. The refusal to be silent and invisible is one of the era's great resources a

[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:48.200]
Magnificent sign of hope he writes. How you like that?

[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:50.880]
If you grow up there's some hope

[00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:56.200]
There may be some people just hope to grow. I'm saying don't be a dope hope to grow

[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:03.240]
The man wants dubbed America's mayor when he just leaves me limp. Yeah

[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:06.960]
So I spend so much time limp there a lot of people leave me limp. Who?

[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:14.400]
Rudy Giuliani Rudy has taken the first effort becoming America's next president on any chances he's got let me take you the answer

[00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:21.800]
Former New York City MNS because he's got no chance to getting the Republican nomination no chance at all

[00:48:23.370 --> 00:48:29.090]
Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani Republican moderates he'd near mythic popularity for his hand to get the 9-11 tanks

[00:48:29.090 --> 00:48:36.350]
All nearly all of it based on BS file papers Friday in New York to create the Rudy Giuliani presidential explorer tour committee ink

[00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:39.290]
A copy of the document was attained by associated press

[00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:44.330]
Creating an explorer to a committee doesn't automatically make him a declared candidate

[00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:46.330]
But it does mean he intends to travel the country

[00:48:46.330 --> 00:48:49.490]
Gaging support and preparing for a White House bid

[00:48:50.070 --> 00:48:53.510]
Mara Giuliani has made a decision yet Giuliani and a spokeswoman sonny

[00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:56.870]
Min delson the statement last night with the finding of this document

[00:48:56.870 --> 00:49:02.030]
We've taken the necessary legal steps so an organization can be put into place and money can be raised to explore a possible

[00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:04.070]
presidential run in 2008

[00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:09.830]
The GOP field is expected to grow with other presidential hopefuls of course John McCain of Arizona and

[00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:14.310]
Massachusetts government Romney Senator Bill Fist that anxious crook from Tennessee

[00:49:14.310 --> 00:49:19.410]
Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and New York governor George Pataki has got a personality like a dead

[00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:19.770]
man

[00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:23.510]
Kind of like Greg Reed dead man in a suit, you know what I'm saying?

[00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:27.410]

And like it bone right off the air

[00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:41.030]
From 180 five votes on the pole. We're gonna have 1300 votes on the area in two shakes of a lambs ass

[00:54:41.550 --> 00:54:43.090]
So anyway lucky numbers slavin

[00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:48.150]
Must be pretty damn good 7.7 out of 10. I am the big one. Say high number

[00:54:48.970 --> 00:54:52.310]
Select fun and very entertaining the only thing I'm looking at the people who are in it

[00:54:53.810 --> 00:54:57.110]
Sleven the start of movie is Josh Hartnett who leaves me very limp

[00:54:57.950 --> 00:54:58.970]
Bruce Willis

[00:54:59.770 --> 00:55:03.990]
Lucy Lou Morgan Freeman Ben Kingsley plays the rabbi

[00:55:05.170 --> 00:55:08.330]
Michael Rubinfield plays Yitzhawk. Oh boy

[00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:15.050]
Plot outline occasion mistaken identity lands slavin Josh Hartnett in the middle of a war being plotted by two of the cities most rival crime bosses

[00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:17.810]
The rabbi Ben Kingsley and the boss Morgan Freeman

[00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:20.870]
Slavin is under constant surveillance by relentless detective

[00:55:21.570 --> 00:55:27.690]
Burkowski Stanley Tucci as well as the infamous assassin good cat played by the umptuous Bruce Willis and finds himself having to

[00:55:27.690 --> 00:55:29.910]
Hatch his own ingenious plot to get them before they give him

[00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:35.970]
But to be pitiful select fun and very entertaining a first review on here 10 out of 10. How do you like that? Wow

[00:55:37.170 --> 00:55:37.970]
heavy duty

[00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:44.810]
trivia Josh Hartnett lived with director Paul McGougan and his girlfriend in New York while the script was being written

[00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:47.590]
McGougan the city thought of having a son and were a towel

[00:55:47.590 --> 00:55:54.210]
A lot of the time because he saw Hartnett and once so often more so than the vulnerable quality to him. I see any can you practically?

[00:55:58.310 --> 00:56:03.730]
So anyway, there is a what that's all about looking at number seven good movie bad bad titles stupid

[00:56:04.350 --> 00:56:05.550]
sudden my ass

[00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:07.970]
Club 90 on the pool

[00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:13.130]
Oil consuming giants the US in China along with oil producing

[00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:14.990]
Behemoth Saudi Arabia

[00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:22.050]
Rank them on the world's worst countries dealing with climate change and new reports is all these reports so many reports in so little time you know

[00:56:23.850 --> 00:56:29.650]
They're dependent on fossil fuels coupled with some sea short-setted energy policies earned them the dubious distinction

[00:56:30.330 --> 00:56:36.050]
Of placing at-bearing near the bottom of a survey of 56 industrialized or industrializing nations it said

[00:56:36.650 --> 00:56:42.650]
The US the world's leading polluter rank 53rd in the annual study by German watch a German environmental group released

[00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:45.030]
On the sidelines of Ewan climate change conference

[00:56:45.610 --> 00:56:50.830]
Saudi Arabia placed dead last while China fell from 29 on last year's list to 54th

[00:56:50.830 --> 00:56:55.250]
According to survey based on the valuation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate policies

[00:56:55.250 --> 00:56:59.670]
The US is refused to accept mandatory cuts of the emissions blamed for the earth's rising temperatures

[00:56:59.670 --> 00:57:03.670]
And is consistently rated poorly on environmental policy matters according to the group

[00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:09.770]
Because it's bad for big business anything that's bad for big business the US don't want no part of screw you guys

[00:57:10.730 --> 00:57:15.830]
Saudi Arabia meanwhile was chided for its poor national and international climate policy and energy inefficiency

[00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:20.130]
Experts suggest that China the world's number two polluter

[00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:28.250]
Tumbled so significantly because of its growing dependence on carbon intensive electricity generation the fuel is exploding economy

[00:57:29.590 --> 00:57:35.970]
At the upper end of the scale seven European countries led by Sweden, Britain, Denmark respectively and trio of developing economies

[00:57:35.970 --> 00:57:38.930]
Argentina, Braithville and India were deemed among the top 10

[00:57:40.110 --> 00:57:44.390]
Others in the top 10 were Malta, Germany, Hungary and Switzerland, Shvice

[00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:50.670]
While France ranked number 12 leading the other group to call for Europe to take the lead and go blow efforts to combat climate change

[00:57:51.790 --> 00:57:55.670]
It is clear from the study of coalition of European countries and some of the large developing countries

[00:57:55.670 --> 00:58:01.830]
Knows what leading environmental policy should take the helm of a coalition to build our future climate regime on German watch policy director

[00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:03.650]
Christopher Boles said

[00:58:05.090 --> 00:58:11.070]
VALS how would you say it balls sure at the same time he lamented that even the effort of the top scores went on up to effectively

[00:58:11.070 --> 00:58:17.130]
Curbin reversed old the warming there is no winner balls said leader sweeten is the only one-eyed king among the blind

[00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:24.590]
So one-eyed snake the study looked at greenhouse gas emissions over the past year over the past five years and environmental climate policies

[00:58:24.590 --> 00:58:31.110]
Only countries that released more than one percent share of all greenhouse gas emissions and rapidly developing economies are targeted by the evaluation

[00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:33.270]
So US near the bottom

[00:58:34.530 --> 00:58:35.990]
Sweden at the top

[00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:38.930]
Now let's see what was the movie I watched last night?

[00:58:39.050 --> 00:58:43.290]
It wasn't a movie was a story about the true story it wasn't movie. That's a bad movie

[00:58:44.330 --> 00:58:46.310]
Return of what then was it?

[00:58:47.110 --> 00:58:47.810]
Dracula? No

[00:58:50.290 --> 00:58:51.430]
I'll tell you

[00:58:52.410 --> 00:58:53.590]
One more please

[00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:59.590]
I get it

[00:59:02.450 --> 00:59:06.470]
The return of Alex Kelly. He was a

[00:59:07.130 --> 00:59:13.210]
Ray Pist and Connecticut. Oh, it's a true story they brought him back you rate two chicks and a very wealthy family

[00:59:13.210 --> 00:59:17.710]
And of course they sent him over to where Europe to first to Switzerland and then to Sweden where he met some hot

[00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:19.490]
She wasn't really very hot in the movie anyway

[00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:25.570]
met some blonde chick and then finally the FBI tracking down they brought him back to go on trial and yada yada

[00:59:25.570 --> 00:59:26.650]
is it was

[00:59:27.170 --> 00:59:27.870]
poorly done

[00:59:30.370 --> 00:59:30.830]
I

[00:59:30.830 --> 00:59:36.690]
Mean it's a good story it's a compelling story, but weekly then movie you don't need to see it return of Alex Kelly all right

[00:59:39.150 --> 00:59:44.090]
Senator julieberman of Connecticut said yesterday that he will caucus would say the Democrats in the new Congress but

[00:59:44.930 --> 00:59:49.250]
He would not rule out switching to Republican caucus if he starts feeling uncomfortable among Democrats

[00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:50.990]
How do you like that turncoat bastard

[00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:51.670]
Oh

[00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:54.550]
Mumbling turncoat

[00:59:55.550 --> 01:00:00.090]
Liberman and Democrat who won elections independent also said he wants to be called an independent Democrat

[01:00:00.090 --> 01:00:05.110]
I got other things to call him like smuggagish lamio shlamazal now. He's got mazel all right

[01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:07.570]
Shwindrick a

[01:00:07.570 --> 01:00:11.910]
Strong backer the Iraq war Liberman was returned to office on election day with strong COP support

[01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:15.390]
He ran his independent after he lost the Democratic Premon Augustine edalamon

[01:00:15.850 --> 01:00:19.430]
What if net is uh is kind to uh you were supposed to look at obvious today?

[01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:22.530]
Lamont crants in the shadow who they have Lamont

[01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:28.190]
He said on yesterday's which I turned it off as soon as I saw him on there that never sure I turned it right off

[01:00:28.190 --> 01:00:29.090]
He was under the press

[01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:31.490]
That he will begin his new term as the Democrat

[01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:35.430]
Because it would make him part of the congressional leadership

[01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:40.170]
The senator is in line to become chairman of the Homeland Security and governmental affairs committee oive

[01:00:41.130 --> 01:00:45.290]
I'm going to caucus with the Democrats both because it's good for my constituents in Connecticut

[01:00:45.290 --> 01:00:49.570]
It would be nice to me he is such a worthy wimpy piece of cured man

[01:00:49.570 --> 01:00:54.130]
He said that because voters returning to capitol hills and independent. I'm now an independent Democrat

[01:00:54.130 --> 01:00:55.510]
Capital i capital D

[01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:59.910]
matter of fact the secretary of the senate called my office and asked how do you want to be identified

[01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:02.750]
And he said how about just schmuck would be good

[01:01:04.110 --> 01:01:07.890]
With many senate democrats having campaign to raise money for Lamont as the party's nominee

[01:01:07.890 --> 01:01:10.710]
Liberman announced it might be a little awkward for him back in Washington

[01:01:11.370 --> 01:01:13.110]
Especially if they start feeding him trief

[01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:18.830]
They played by the traditional partisan political playbook and I can't say I enjoyed it but we're all grown up

[01:01:18.830 --> 01:01:21.970]
We've got a job to do and we're going to do my best to get that job done. He said

[01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:28.770]
Democrats will hold a 51 to 49 inch in the Senate so Liberman the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2000 could find himself

[01:01:28.770 --> 01:01:29.870]
courted by the Republicans

[01:01:30.930 --> 01:01:36.130]
He was asked about the possibility that it might switch caucuses if he became uncomfortable as Democrats start to enforce party discipline

[01:01:36.130 --> 01:01:40.590]
Especially if the GOP offered to keep him as a committee chairman and respect his seniority

[01:01:41.250 --> 01:01:43.410]
I'm not ruling it out but I hope I don't get to that point

[01:01:43.410 --> 01:01:46.130]
I must say with all respect that the republicans have supported me in Connecticut

[01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:49.110]
Nobody ever said we're doing this because we want you to switch over

[01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:54.890]
Switch over to the human race in his case. I don't think he's capable of doing that

Oh the system can't display high definition video and its storage and processing power are limited compared with the ps3 and xbox 360 but

[01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:46.730]
Nintendo is hoping the system's innovative wireless controller which tracks movements to mimic a football pass or the swing of a golf club will attract new consumers in their 20s and 30s

But Brandon was quick to wed. I don't want to even think about waiting a couple of months

[01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:46.390]
Amen, we've all had those moments, you know, you look at something you want and you're thinking I don't even want to think about waiting a couple of months

[01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:48.470]
Hmm

[01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:54.690]
And we all had those thoughts all the time just this morning really

[01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:56.710]

We thought he always had his blood in his mouth

[01:11:33.710 --> 01:11:37.190]
They please be a Clinton about it all the time

[01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:41.030]
They call it woman, I think no right slime

[01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:44.630]
But do we say she's going all around my desk?

[01:11:45.450 --> 01:11:48.730]
That's why we should turn the dishes a mess

[01:11:48.730 --> 01:11:52.930]
Who would have thought we would have thought that

[01:11:53.950 --> 01:11:55.210]
Alright, here we go on the desk

[01:11:56.690 --> 01:12:01.050]
Oh, Mr. Speaker

[01:12:01.050 --> 01:12:04.070]
Mr. Speaker, the committee would like to know

[01:12:04.670 --> 01:12:07.210]

I'll see

[01:12:10.590 --> 01:12:11.830]

Sure, you can't hear up and maybe watch us act

[01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:30.130]
A free hundred public and an auto

[01:12:31.050 --> 01:12:34.450]
A committee, maybe can I give you the phone

[01:12:34.450 --> 01:12:39.110]
Who would have thought we would have thought that

[01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:42.530]
Remember, maybe it meets the Jewish singer of the house

[01:12:43.530 --> 01:13:05.070]
What

[01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:13.910]
Number 45 at 560 WQM, happy to do the interesting feature they got in the Palm Beach Post

[01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:14.550]
of all places.

[01:13:14.910 --> 01:13:16.850]
Is that surprising that they have anything interesting?

[01:13:17.850 --> 01:13:18.150]
I suppose.

[01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:19.410]
I mean real interesting.

[01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:23.110]
I mean like mildly, it's called the blog squad.

[01:13:25.210 --> 01:13:28.950]
And it says a Brooklyn pizza from Donald O's, forget about it is what it says.

[01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:31.650]
Now who wrote this?

[01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:33.610]
Who's blog is this from?

[01:13:33.610 --> 01:13:34.630]
See, I don't know.

[01:13:35.650 --> 01:13:36.450]
I can't tell.

[01:13:36.810 --> 01:13:37.730]
Does it really make a difference?

[01:13:37.890 --> 01:13:38.370]
No, we don't care.

[01:13:38.910 --> 01:13:42.490]
It just says when I bid in to Domino's latest innovation in pizza, the Brooklyn style

[01:13:42.490 --> 01:13:46.230]
pie, I couldn't help but address the slice in my hands with a play on a famous political

[01:13:46.230 --> 01:13:46.530]
remark.

[01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:48.430]
I know, New York pizza.

[01:13:48.450 --> 01:13:50.410]
I said in Domino's, you know New York pizza.

[01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:54.650]
It's true, there's nothing vaguely New York is about the Domino's pie.

[01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:57.990]
And by the way, since when is there a distinction between New York and Brooklyn pizza?

[01:13:58.290 --> 01:14:00.490]
The most big apple natives like myself, they're one on the same.

[01:14:00.710 --> 01:14:01.230]
That is correct.

[01:14:01.950 --> 01:14:03.310]
I never heard of Brooklyn pizza, do you?

[01:14:03.890 --> 01:14:06.690]
No, but I had some of that product that they're advertising now.

[01:14:07.190 --> 01:14:09.210]
And worst pizza ever.

[01:14:10.250 --> 01:14:11.050]
Yeah, ever.

[01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:15.490]
I was curious to give Domino's a chance because of all the hype about the pie it says.

[01:14:15.690 --> 01:14:19.450]
After I read the recent New York Times story about the change in new pie, I became more

[01:14:19.450 --> 01:14:19.830]
curious.

[01:14:20.270 --> 01:14:22.470]
The time so quickly this missed that I had a taste of it for myself.

[01:14:22.810 --> 01:14:25.550]
Was the times right or was this just New York snobbery and it's worse?

[01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:29.950]
Anybody with a brain knows that the best pizza in North America is in New York, in North

[01:14:29.950 --> 01:14:32.910]
America, not in the world, not like a Nidalee baby.

[01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:36.210]
I don't know, Chicago has pretty good pizza.

[01:14:38.250 --> 01:14:39.290]
Let me say it again.

[01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:44.810]
If you like to fix Chicago style pizza, which I do, only one slice weighs about seven pounds.

[01:14:45.010 --> 01:14:46.570]
Yeah, that's the problem.

[01:14:46.670 --> 01:14:51.270]
You don't eat New York style pizza with a fork unless you're a kind of a whooist, some

[01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:54.070]
kind of a guy we had to story about today, some kind of a pussie.

[01:14:55.770 --> 01:14:59.870]
Anyway, the times as right it says, Domino's pie, I tried both the sausage and pepper

[01:14:59.870 --> 01:15:04.330]
only versions, $30 would tax and tip for two standard size pies delivered to my home.

[01:15:04.610 --> 01:15:05.230]
Third man.

[01:15:05.490 --> 01:15:06.750]
Had the crust wrong for starters.

[01:15:07.450 --> 01:15:12.330]
In an effort to replicate the foldable New York crust, the chain is overcomensated and

[01:15:12.330 --> 01:15:14.710]
may have pie that borders texture wise on the floppy.

[01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:17.850]
Maybe you can stick it in your computer and your floppy disk.

[01:15:19.370 --> 01:15:22.210]
New York slices that designated a fit in the hand, but they are designed to droop.

[01:15:22.510 --> 01:15:25.250]
Oh yeah, they shouldn't droop when you put in your hand and the pie either.

[01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:27.090]
It says but it gets worse.

[01:15:27.490 --> 01:15:30.830]
The cheese on the earth pies, most of them mozzarella, has a certain subtle flavor and

[01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:31.330]
pliability.

[01:15:31.450 --> 01:15:35.450]
With a domino pie, all you taste is salt and the cheese is melt into the gooey strands

[01:15:35.450 --> 01:15:36.490]
I remember from my childhood.

[01:15:37.170 --> 01:15:38.530]
Oh, it's got a melt into gooey strands.

[01:15:39.550 --> 01:15:40.930]
See here we go with the food again.

[01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:42.130]
Now what attracted me to this?

[01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:42.790]
I don't eat much.

[01:15:42.890 --> 01:15:44.190]
I'm just bad for my blood.

[01:15:44.410 --> 01:15:46.030]
You're like a domino so you want it ripped and which is fine.

[01:15:46.290 --> 01:15:47.470]
Why did you say that?

[01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:48.230]
Because it's true.

[01:15:48.590 --> 01:15:48.730]
Oh.

[01:15:49.310 --> 01:15:50.930]
It says but the complaints don't stop there.

[01:15:51.090 --> 01:15:54.050]
How about an insipid tomato sauce with no hint of sweet fried tomatoes?

[01:15:54.490 --> 01:15:56.670]
Or toppings that border on the cartonish?

[01:15:57.090 --> 01:16:01.630]
The sausage is more like pork lumps, oddly misshapen and thoroughly unaffetizing.

[01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:05.670]
The time and story note of the domino has already faced some controversy with its commercials

[01:16:05.670 --> 01:16:08.690]
for the pie, which play up every New York stereotype you can imagine.

[01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:11.090]
I wouldn't mind that so much if the pie was halfway decent.

[01:16:11.290 --> 01:16:12.990]
It says, trust me, it's not.

[01:16:13.530 --> 01:16:15.190]
You think it's pizza but it's not.

[01:16:16.210 --> 01:16:18.850]
I could have written a much shorter and better review.

[01:16:19.170 --> 01:16:20.290]
Well, do you want to hear some of the comments?

[01:16:20.690 --> 01:16:20.890]
Okay.

[01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:22.510]
Here's one by Dan.

[01:16:22.510 --> 01:16:24.350]
He says, I tried the domino's Brooklyn style pizza.

[01:16:24.530 --> 01:16:27.970]
It's not bad for domino's because domino's has to be the worst franchise pizza around.

[01:16:28.410 --> 01:16:29.890]
Anyway, you have to go up North to give good pizza.

[01:16:30.030 --> 01:16:31.070]
Anyways, not just New York either.

[01:16:31.170 --> 01:16:34.710]
The Midwest is good tasting pizza also, which Josh has told us about that Chicago style.

[01:16:36.750 --> 01:16:40.090]
I still did like even though it's been out of business for a long time, shakies.

[01:16:40.170 --> 01:16:40.890]
I know that book.

[01:16:41.190 --> 01:16:45.270]
There was a shakies in Tampa on Dale Maybury and there was a shakies in Kalamazoo.

[01:16:46.370 --> 01:16:47.090]
Don't remember shakies?

[01:16:47.530 --> 01:16:47.730]
Nope.

[01:16:48.170 --> 01:16:49.730]
Little on the salty side but it's pretty good.

[01:16:50.550 --> 01:16:51.570]
Here's one by Fred.

[01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:54.310]
It says the best pizza is the new chain in town, Vocheli.

[01:16:54.510 --> 01:16:55.530]
It's real close to New York pizza.

[01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:57.370]
Vocheli for the Palm Beach crowd.

[01:16:57.510 --> 01:16:58.930]
I don't think we have any Vocheli in date of rod.

[01:16:59.050 --> 01:16:59.370]
Never heard of it.

[01:16:59.490 --> 01:16:59.650]
Did you?

[01:16:59.970 --> 01:17:00.070]
No.

[01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:00.170]
No.

[01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:06.010]
Here's one that says, I'm on vacation in Nashville with a cup of New York pizza craving

[01:17:06.010 --> 01:17:07.150]
also went to a pizza hub.

[01:17:07.470 --> 01:17:09.370]
Requested a small cheese pizza with crisp crust.

[01:17:10.050 --> 01:17:11.150]
It ain't like New York out here either.

[01:17:11.170 --> 01:17:12.630]
What happened to the olive oil grouping everywhere?

[01:17:13.250 --> 01:17:17.170]
Well, first of all, these people are alluding themselves, aren't they?

[01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:18.390]
They're alluding and deluding.

[01:17:19.010 --> 01:17:20.050]
They're doing delabit.

[01:17:21.450 --> 01:17:24.210]
Here's one that says any pie you get down this part of the country only close to what

[01:17:24.210 --> 01:17:27.630]
real pies are up north in the York and Chicago pizza because the water down here is not

[01:17:27.630 --> 01:17:28.690]
the same as the water up north.

[01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:32.990]
From biscuits to bagels to delicate French pastries, the water here sucks for bread period.

[01:17:33.390 --> 01:17:36.590]
As far as the other ingredients are named on the two pies, what do you expect from Domino's

[01:17:36.590 --> 01:17:36.870]
anyway?

[01:17:37.310 --> 01:17:37.310]

[01:17:38.490 --> 01:17:39.430]
Well, sarcasm there.

[01:17:39.670 --> 01:17:40.290]
Or the caustic.

[01:17:41.630 --> 01:17:44.690]
Here's one that says, okay, pizza experts, the real deal down here in South Florida

[01:17:44.690 --> 01:17:46.990]
when it comes to pizza is past squalies and cruel springs.

[01:17:47.470 --> 01:17:51.170]
A drive I know will not a field of cruel springs, but your taste buds will thank you.

[01:17:51.210 --> 01:17:52.290]
Are you familiar with past squalies?

[01:17:52.410 --> 01:17:53.610]
How do you wish having lived in cruel springs?

[01:17:53.610 --> 01:17:54.450]
Yes, it's excellent.

[01:17:55.230 --> 01:17:57.950]
Clean, no less than the bottom of the crust, cheese and soft to die for.

[01:17:58.230 --> 01:17:59.050]
A perfect pie.

[01:17:59.450 --> 01:17:59.630]
Hmm.

[01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:01.150]
There's nothing like a perfect pie.

[01:18:01.390 --> 01:18:01.910]
That's what I always said.

[01:18:02.510 --> 01:18:04.230]
Oh, I do like it if it's key lime pie.

[01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:07.290]
I say it's no pizza pie and cruel springs, but I give it a second.

[01:18:07.610 --> 01:18:08.210]
Second place.

[01:18:08.410 --> 01:18:08.970]
Pizza time?

[01:18:09.130 --> 01:18:09.430]
That's right.

[01:18:10.830 --> 01:18:11.270]
Time's up.

[01:18:11.430 --> 01:18:12.430]
And buy men from Italy.

[01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:16.790]
How come no one remembers the Italian name for pizza at La Beats?

[01:18:16.890 --> 01:18:20.230]
It says, only those who know that, what we have with pizza, there's probably some dirty

[01:18:20.230 --> 01:18:20.950]
word out of it.

[01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:21.490]
Hmm.

[01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:23.170]
Then here's one that says, Dalano is stocks.

[01:18:23.170 --> 01:18:25.610]
All they had was cut the size of it, bigger and used larger topics.

[01:18:25.830 --> 01:18:27.850]
In fact, you shouldn't be eating pizzas especially.

[01:18:28.390 --> 01:18:31.670]
And that's where I stopped the pruning style, especially, I don't know.

[01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:36.690]
See, compared to their regular pizza, which I consider to just be a dust free and edible,

[01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:37.330]
you know, edible.

[01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:40.870]
I consider it edible, as opposed to some other chains that I don't want to mention.

[01:18:41.810 --> 01:18:43.530]
There's a chain here called pizza pizza.

[01:18:43.670 --> 01:18:46.750]
It is so bad, it makes Dalano seem like a chef to be on.

[01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:52.030]
Anyway, this Brooklyn thing, a worse piece of slop that worse than the chicken.

[01:18:52.030 --> 01:18:54.030]
I do not think Dalano is working on a style pizza.

[01:18:54.490 --> 01:18:56.530]
I guess that could be advertising on the show then pretty soon.

[01:18:56.670 --> 01:18:57.710]
It's worse than the chicken.

[01:18:57.730 --> 01:18:58.790]
By the way, it's not growing something.

[01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:59.950]
I don't think that's the other one.

[01:19:00.150 --> 01:19:01.150]
That's what you know what it is.

[01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:02.310]
And they want to clock our cross.

[01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:03.050]
Oh, okay.

[01:19:03.490 --> 01:19:04.590]
Well, no, he's not responding.

[01:19:04.590 --> 01:19:06.770]
And I'm sure there's no reason for me to be doing that.

[01:19:06.850 --> 01:19:07.890]
I just don't do that.

[01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:12.570]
See, this guy thinks if he just ignores, I'll do whatever the hell they put on the log.

[01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:15.070]
And then I'll just, you know, they just fake their way through.

[01:19:15.450 --> 01:19:16.290]
You're a faker, baby.

[01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:18.730]
Dick Nixon was a quaker and you're a faker.

[01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:23.130]
And I'd like to have that shaker at the shakies.

[01:19:25.570 --> 01:19:28.910]
You know how they have in some places like in a good Italian restaurant, they have shakers

[01:19:28.910 --> 01:19:33.930]
would like, not just Parmesan cheese, or somebody I know would say Parmesan, but also

[01:19:33.930 --> 01:19:35.550]
would like, what do you call it?

[01:19:36.050 --> 01:19:36.590]
What do you call it?

[01:19:37.150 --> 01:19:38.370]
You know what I'm talking about?

[01:19:38.810 --> 01:19:40.570]
About those pepper things?

[01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:43.230]
Yeah, those pepper things like grated peppers, you know.

[01:19:44.730 --> 01:19:46.290]
See, at least he knows what I'm talking about.

[01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:48.550]
George who pretends to be a pizza kind of swir.

[01:19:48.890 --> 01:19:49.210]
I do.

[01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:52.730]
No, that's what you're, you're, you're ripping out of this pizza.

[01:19:52.730 --> 01:19:52.870]
What's that?

[01:19:53.290 --> 01:19:53.970]
Go ahead.

[01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:54.750]
Well, what is it?

[01:19:55.150 --> 01:19:59.950]
It's the worst piece of slop worse than any frozen pizza you could get if it was rotten.

[01:20:00.110 --> 01:20:00.590]
How about to know?

[01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:01.910]
It's better.

[01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:03.070]
Totino's is better.

[01:20:03.250 --> 01:20:03.990]
Tombstone is better.

[01:20:05.550 --> 01:20:08.250]
They're not even using their regular pedestrian ingredients.

[01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:11.050]
They're using some indoneasy and imported slop crap.

[01:20:11.570 --> 01:20:13.910]
It's wet, it's greasy, it's slimy, it tastes like crap.

[01:20:14.130 --> 01:20:14.750]
Other than that, it's great.

[01:20:16.330 --> 01:20:18.070]
But the obvious question is how do you like it?

[01:20:18.590 --> 01:20:19.210]
Oh, I like it a lot.

[01:20:19.230 --> 01:20:21.030]
13, I written 60, if you've also had a poll.

[01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:27.110]
The biggest pony of them all, Nancy graces only got five and Julie Broomins already got

[01:20:27.110 --> 01:20:27.470]
her tied.

[01:20:27.810 --> 01:20:28.710]
How do you like that, Nancy?

[01:20:29.070 --> 01:20:29.290]
Framed.

[01:20:29.890 --> 01:20:30.970]
He's already got her tied.

[01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:31.770]
And not.

[01:20:33.390 --> 01:20:36.670]
The 71-year-old pilot, remember we had that story yesterday about the guy who crashed

[01:20:36.670 --> 01:20:38.310]
is a plane in the middle of your life.

[01:20:39.750 --> 01:20:43.530]
See in South Florida, it's not just ancient drivers who are driving automobiles who are

[01:20:43.530 --> 01:20:46.030]
threat to your very existence, it's ancient pilots.

[01:20:47.110 --> 01:20:50.490]
The 71-year-old pilot who crashed at single ends and claimed that the art of a home near

[01:20:50.490 --> 01:20:54.870]
Lantern here for yesterday morning apparently had no valid pilots license federal authorities

[01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:55.270]
said.

[01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:56.270]
A Toshada.

[01:20:57.150 --> 01:21:01.430]
The FAA is investigating Allen Schultz's license which appears not to be current.

[01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:06.230]
As it's ascended over a residential neighborhood southeast of the airport, the plane snaps several

[01:21:06.230 --> 01:21:07.990]
utility lines, slowing its impact.

[01:21:08.130 --> 01:21:10.170]
The crash at 1102 yesterday morning.

[01:21:11.970 --> 01:21:15.810]
The power lines saved me and saved him too, said Chris G.S. owner of the property at

[01:21:15.810 --> 01:21:16.970]
60-21 Pine Drive.

[01:21:17.370 --> 01:21:19.790]
South of Lentana Road that turned into an emergency landing strip.

[01:21:20.530 --> 01:21:22.870]
The plane came to rest against G.S. Ford Taurus.

[01:21:23.430 --> 01:21:28.030]
O.G.S. Taurus, which sustained only minor damage, I wonder if the Taurus had any Taurus.

[01:21:28.970 --> 01:21:31.990]
The fuselage appeared in tact but the wings were shredded almost sheared off.

[01:21:32.610 --> 01:21:34.090]
No one on the ground was injured, thanks God.

[01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:38.070]
Shultz of Palm Beach Gardens was bleeding from a cut on his nose but refused treatment

[01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:38.550]
of the scene.

[01:21:39.710 --> 01:21:43.330]
I'm doing okay, Schultz told reporters he left the crash site with a friend, he declined

[01:21:43.330 --> 01:21:44.190]
to comment further.

[01:21:44.690 --> 01:21:49.790]
The NTSB and the FAA, which enforces pilot licensing regulations and plane registrations, are

[01:21:49.870 --> 01:21:51.790]
resting in the crash agency officials to be seen.

[01:21:52.710 --> 01:21:57.670]
Throne said Schultz applied for a primary registration in June 2004 but the application

[01:21:57.670 --> 01:21:58.470]
is still pending.

[01:21:58.830 --> 01:21:59.930]
It's still pending, baby.

[01:22:00.350 --> 01:22:02.690]
The plane is bending because the application is still pending.

[01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:06.870]
If he renewed his license within the past few days, that wouldn't show up in his record

[01:22:06.870 --> 01:22:07.330]
she said.

[01:22:07.730 --> 01:22:10.290]
Questions about Schultz's license came up after he left the crash scene.

[01:22:11.650 --> 01:22:14.450]
Cracks knocked out, powered of 46 homes until late yesterday afternoon.

[01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:17.810]
Florida Punderland Loot Pants today to replace a pole down by the plane.

[01:22:17.810 --> 01:22:20.530]
In addition, G.S. and his wife Stephanie were at home when they heard loud noise.

[01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:22.410]
I thought it was an earthquake, G.S. said.

[01:22:22.650 --> 01:22:24.070]
I went out and he was already out of the plane.

[01:22:24.450 --> 01:22:25.330]
I told him to sit down.

[01:22:25.690 --> 01:22:26.890]
Power lines were all around the plane.

[01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:27.810]
I didn't know if they were hot.

[01:22:29.350 --> 01:22:30.910]
Christine Assetton looks next to the G.S.

[01:22:31.470 --> 01:22:34.990]
The plane stripped off the top of a roof in chimney and a wheel from the plane ended up

[01:22:34.990 --> 01:22:37.190]
in her basement on top of her Christmas ornament, she said.

[01:22:37.930 --> 01:22:38.730]
Oh, G.S.

[01:22:39.090 --> 01:22:41.530]
When it hit my bedstroke, Assetton said this is crazy.

[01:22:41.610 --> 01:22:42.230]
It's my day off.

[01:22:42.510 --> 01:22:43.830]
I'm supposed to be sleeping all day.

[01:22:45.070 --> 01:22:48.130]
Neighbors Laura and Travis Turquins had claimed to fly solo as they approached the

[01:22:48.130 --> 01:22:51.370]
antenna airport that their bedshakes, they for some of their incidents will continue.

[01:22:52.290 --> 01:22:54.110]
Well, it's about time something made their bedshake.

[01:22:54.410 --> 01:22:55.130]
Just a joke, Laura.

[01:22:56.290 --> 01:23:00.270]
On January 22nd, 2004, a small plane crashed and burst into flames in the front yard of

[01:23:00.270 --> 01:23:05.150]
a home on Crest Drive, North Atlanta road, the 79-year-old pilot and his daughter died.

[01:23:05.490 --> 01:23:08.410]
No one on the ground was hurt in that crash, but about 1,300 homes lost power.

[01:23:08.730 --> 01:23:10.070]
The 79-year-old pilot.

[01:23:12.050 --> 01:23:15.810]
Since 1982, nine people have died in five aircraft crashes in the Lantern area, according

[01:23:15.810 --> 01:23:18.590]
to the MTSP, I wonder how many times it almost happened.

[01:23:18.730 --> 01:23:20.530]
Travis Turquins said the threat is there.

[01:23:20.890 --> 01:23:21.850]
It's not a good place to live.

[01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:25.210]
Right by the airport, they're coming down mighty low.

[01:23:25.970 --> 01:23:28.970]
Of course, they're 110 years old and they're visionate real good.

[01:23:29.550 --> 01:23:33.450]
And the reflexes, all of these things and stuff like that.

[01:23:34.290 --> 01:23:34.890]
Minor details.

[01:23:35.730 --> 01:23:36.850]
So I'm really disappointed.

[01:23:36.850 --> 01:23:39.970]
I thought maybe I'd come on down the order one of them Brooklyn Domino Pizza.

[01:23:40.050 --> 01:23:40.670]
Sure you did.

[01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:42.150]
You believe me?

[01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:42.470]
No.

[01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:46.170]
Or come down for that Christmas party, the big holiday party, the Christmas Chanooka,

[01:23:46.470 --> 01:23:50.930]
a quans of party, whatever it is we're having at that place that I'm not telling the

[01:23:50.930 --> 01:23:54.730]
audience because then they'll all show up there on December 4th at 6 p.m.

[01:23:55.330 --> 01:23:57.570]
Show for cocktails, okay, and see if anybody lets you in.

[01:23:59.270 --> 01:24:02.190]
Just pick a place and see if you think that's where it's going to be.

[01:24:03.530 --> 01:24:05.550]
And show up and say, hey, there's a Joe Bell.

[01:24:05.550 --> 01:24:07.250]
And there's a clearance over there.

[01:24:07.690 --> 01:24:08.690]
I'll pass that in the corner.

[01:24:09.390 --> 01:24:11.070]
And there's a Rose in the horse.

[01:24:11.950 --> 01:24:13.290]
Speaking of horses, ours.

[01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:20.950]
I'm going to cry for hours about that announcement by the Aachen.

[01:24:21.410 --> 01:24:22.490]
This is Mark Morgan.

[01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:25.670]
It's the 12 to 1 hour on Q8M.

[01:24:30.170 --> 01:24:35.390]
She only was 7th when she ordered in.

[01:24:35.690 --> 01:24:45.850]
On through two more coverage for CNN ignoring the weather and storms to avoid her white trash

[01:24:45.850 --> 01:24:49.330]
which mother said she died with joy.

[01:24:49.850 --> 01:24:51.710]
I'm dying on my hands.

[01:25:00.490 --> 01:25:21.630]

[01:25:21.630 --> 01:25:51.610]

[01:39:58.090 --> 01:40:03.110]
Scheller also resigned from his position at the James A. Haley VA Medical Center.

[01:40:08.150 --> 01:40:15.310]
Scheller knowingly possessed images and pictures of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct, according to an indictment released last week.

[01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:41.030]
