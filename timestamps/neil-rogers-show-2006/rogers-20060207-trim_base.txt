[00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:14.880]
On the next Oprah, you'll be shocked. You'll be amazed. You'll be talking about it for the next however long until she shocks you again. Oprah makes your wildest dreams come true.

[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:25.420]
Today, everyone in the studio audience, all 276 members get a brand new liver.

[00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.880]
Everybody gets a liver, and the body gets better.

[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:37.600]
Then, tomorrow, all 276 studio audience members get a brand new uvula.

[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.140]
Everybody gets a brand new uvula. Everybody gets a brand new uvula.

[00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.900]
The next day, all 276 members of the studio audience get a three-foot helper monkey.

[00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.240]
Everybody gets a brain-footed helper monkey. Everybody gets a brain-footed helper monkey.

[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.800]
The next day, all 276 audience members get a new prosthetic arm.

[00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.200]
Everybody gets a breasted arm. Everybody gets a breasted baby.

[00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.100]
Oprah giving away great stuff she didn't have to pay for. Even though she could easily afford to.

[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.700]
And next season, everybody in the studio audience gets a dead man.

[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.120]
Everybody gets a brain-footed helper monkey.

[00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.020]
Okay, 10-1, man. I am so tired of that bitch. I just can't stand it.

[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.420]
If I never saw her again, it would be way too soon.

[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.480]
Well, guess what? You're gonna see her again and again.

[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.260]
Oh, I don't wanna see her. You can't help it.

[00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.920]
I don't wanna see her in your pop-up toast.

[00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.420]
Oh, geez. I thought she was kinda like on your recto myself.

[00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.580]
Oh, that would be too low to carry around.

[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.060]
More good news from Iraq, not all of 13 dead in Afghanistan, other suicide bombing attack.

[00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.460]
The Taliban, who I thought weren't they supposed to be all done?

[00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.220]
They all moped up, done. They got the bomb.

[00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.420]
Did we wipe them in? Or the world?

[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.340]
I guess not. They're like all back with the vengeance.

[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.020]
They're growing in my puppies and they're like killing people.

[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.920]
And they've picked up on the suicide bomb thing.

[00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.620]
So they're just, you know, they're there.

[00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.620]
Did a hell of a job. Heck, I'm a job, Bob Brownie.

[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.440]
In Afghanistan and in Iraq, authorities say two bombs exploded just minutes apart

[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.280]
near a central Baghdad square today killing at least seven people.

[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.660]
And separately in Western Iraq, four more US Marines died in explosions there.

[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.000]
And the number, we're actually approaching that 3,000 number.

[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.380]
Won't that be the number when the public finally gets to all bend out of shape and aid?

[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.400]
Oh, marching in the streets and demonstrating and carrying on screaming and yelling like those people in Pittsburgh to the yesterday?

[00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.320]
Won't that be happening? Sure. What?

[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.260]
Yeah. No. Well, no.

[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.440]
American public are passive. They're beaten like like Diana said in network. Remember that?

[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.200]
Mm-hmm.

[00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.900]
She said they're shot up and F themselves limp and they're just giving up.

[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.540]
Remember that?

[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.660]
Yep. I mentioned Josh remembers that.

[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.580]
I bet she was even awake for that part of the movie.

[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.860]
No, I think I missed that part.

[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.220]
No.

[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.340]
Oh.

[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.160]
Watched in what is it again?

[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.900]
I love that movie. I just can't think of an input.

[00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.120]
Imaginary hero.

[00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.700]
Imaginary hero is again last night.

[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.700]
Sigourney Weaver and Emil Hirscher both so good and Jeff Daniels too.

[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:05.100]
Hello.

[00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.020]
I mean, you know, his character is very negative.

[00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.240]
He plays him perfectly.

[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.300]
Yeah, very zombie.

[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.580]
Yeah, I'm holding it.

[00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.600]
It's just a great movie.

[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.880]
In fact, we have to do that pull some time.

[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.560]
I was thinking about doing that today, but I'm not.

[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.500]
What?

[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.400]
No, no, seriously, movie.

[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.480]
Other than a godfather, which I'm so say, we love the godfather,

[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.280]
but it's so obvious.

[00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.160]
It's like a pool today.

[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.460]
I don't even know why I put Hitler on there because we knew he'd win.

[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.780]
Sure.

[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.360]
I should have said other than...

[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.500]
Hitler.

[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.300]
Hitler.

[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.020]
But that's okay because the race today is for a second place.

[00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.240]
But what movie could you just watch over and over again?

[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.120]
I never get tired of watching.

[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.580]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.140]
There are gotta be movies like that.

[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.920]
Imaginary hero is for me.

[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.660]
Uh-huh.

[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.840]
I just love that movie.

[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.960]
You don't?

[00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.440]
No, that's a very good movie.

[00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.860]
I can watch it again.

[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:50.720]
You would watch it again, though.

[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:51.660]
Watch the little piece of it, sure.

[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.060]
I did, actually.

[00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.200]
Well, there's Jesse Jackson looking there.

[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.960]
Look, what is that?

[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.380]
What kind of hat is that?

[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.420]
Oh, let me change it.

[00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.320]
Look at that.

[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.300]
What kind of hat is Jesse wearing that?

[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.440]
It looks like a gangster called a fedora, son.

[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.580]
Get out of here.

[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.640]
Well, don't, uh, gangsters, and they wear fedoras.

[00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.500]
Edward G. Robinson, I was the war fedora.

[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.080]
You took it right.

[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:10.140]
Oh.

[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.820]
Look at that.

[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.260]
There's Jesse with a fedora.

[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.620]
Well.

[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.820]
And then, of course, Oprah was there grandstanding at the funeral.

[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.720]
Yesterday, and they're making her big speech.

[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.740]
And, uh, geez.

[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.900]
Maybe she was also an autograph and copies of that book, you think?

[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.860]
Yeah.

[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.520]
I mean, a little...

[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.920]
What about the rubber band?

[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.700]
A little...

[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.820]
Right.

[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.060]
Anyway, here's our poll from yesterday.

[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.180]
Which of these best describes you?

[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.620]
1584 votes.

[00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.820]
Average 411.

[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.520]
Which, I guess, you would think average would be the right answer, right?

[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.540]
Like this call is probably average for us.

[00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.140]
Q-A-M.

[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:42.200]
Hello?

[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.180]
Hey, that's Edna.

[00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.960]
Yeah.

[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.980]
Wow.

[00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:45.740]
What about heat?

[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.680]
What about heat?

[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.820]
You know?

[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.360]
No.

[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.520]
For like a good movie, you know, then you can watch a good movie.

[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.040]
Not here.

[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.140]
Which of these best describes you?

[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.220]
Average 411.

[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.840]
Did I say we're doing that today?

[00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.800]
No.

[00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.640]
But it'll give us something to crawl in about.

[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.800]
In fact, we could formulate that list for another day.

[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.000]
That's a great idea.

[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.000]
Because a lot of them.

[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.680]
What?

[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.740]
We've done that before.

[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.440]
We have?

[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.340]
Maybe not this far ahead.

[00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.940]
No.

[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.240]
When you're going to be investigated by both.

[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.640]
When it's like in the middle of May, right?

[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.260]
Not necessarily this year.

[00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.720]
Yeah.

[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.360]
But that is a good, I mean, there are all of those kind of movies.

[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.180]
And not necessarily real famous movies.

[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.680]
Like, I mean, imaginary heroes isn't exactly one of the movies.

[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.040]
Although it didn't get like several stars, hundred stars.

[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.200]
Just, I don't know, just something in that.

[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.180]
Really hard to describe it.

[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.780]
It's not all just Emil Hershey.

[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.920]
They're all always sure we'd like to hang out with him.

[00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.860]
Average 411.

[00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.000]
I have no life 247.

[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.640]
I have no idea.

[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.240]
I know, believe me.

[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.820]
We've talked to many of you and trust me.

[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.020]
The evidence is overwhelming.

[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.380]
Hot stud, 121.

[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.780]
Ha, ha, ha, yeah.

[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.100]
Uh-huh.

[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.160]
Those are people living homes that don't have writers.

[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:54.880]
And half the Julio is voted for that.

[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.640]
Right.

[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:56.140]
Oh, yeah.

[00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.960]
Well, if you were enough jewelry, man.

[00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.600]
That's right.

[00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:59.240]
You're a studly.

[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.480]
Fat slug.

[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.180]
All that bling.

[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.300]
Fat slug.

[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.340]
Just make sure you're bling diving into shots.

[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.060]
Fat slug 93.

[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.900]
Because if you don't got a thing, at least get some bling.

[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:10.620]
Lazy turd 81.

[00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.500]
I'm a fat Jew 74.

[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:14.580]
Julio 68.

[00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:15.060]
Incredible.

[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.620]
Computer nerd 64.

[00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:17.940]
Narotic 55.

[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.080]
We've talked to all of them.

[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.840]
Redneck 47.

[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.360]
Old troll 43.

[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.380]
Anel.

[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.240]
Brackdom 39.

[00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.880]
Racist 38.

[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.860]
Vanilla 32.

[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.800]
Young punk 32.

[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.240]
Closet case 26.

[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.900]
You're fairly.

[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:31.680]
Chocolate.

[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:32.140]
Chocolate.

[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.400]
See, I can't say it the way that Ray Nagan says it.

[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.420]
He says it in English, man.

[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:36.960]
Maybe he could have loathe with O'Proceed.

[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.300]
There goes with that racial thing again.

[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.780]
I don't think he'd have one of them as black.

[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.740]
So it's not a racial thing.

[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.020]
They're chocolate 25.

[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:44.580]
Wallflower 20.

[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:46.620]
Hateful bitch 19.

[00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:47.740]
George knows some of you.

[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.260]
Screaming queen 18.

[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.160]
I know some of them.

[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.300]
Angry Muslim 13.

[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:52.800]
How do you like that?

[00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:53.740]
Oh my god.

[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.180]
Wow.

[00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:55.300]
Oh, we better watch it.

[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.260]
Better not throw in the controversial cartoons.

[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.140]
In fact, remember Jack Waltskin, a godfather,

[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.540]
keeps saying cartoon, cartoon.

[00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.420]
He knew he was psychic.

[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:04.560]
Cartoon.

[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:05.660]
I just can't get.

[00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.240]
Jesse looks just sillier than usual later.

[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:08.380]
Really?

[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:09.720]
I'm seeing it.

[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.440]
Yeah, he looks like a chocolate gangster.

[00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.120]
Man, maybe he's in charge of the Harlem or something.

[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.240]
I may be bubble put him in charge of all the numbers racket in Harlem.

[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.440]
Mocha 10.

[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.100]
Money grabbing bitch five.

[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.540]
And gothic, celimente trace.

[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:24.140]
Only three.

[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:25.580]
Gothic.

[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:27.560]
Yeah.

[00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:30.300]
Okay.

[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:31.360]
Whatever you say.

[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.680]
Well, they're on the dark side.

[00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.380]
You know, they watch reruns of what that was that show?

[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:36.200]
Dark shadows.

[00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:37.120]
Okay.

[00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:37.460]
Right.

[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.700]
But Barnaby, Barnaby, so what are the hell is that Barnaby Schwartz?

[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:42.700]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:44.160]
Neil.

[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:45.740]
I can just hear Bill Ross now.

[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.380]
Barnaby Schwartz always gets his man.

[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:47.680]
Yes.

[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:49.740]
You forgot one on your pole.

[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.580]
One on what pole, which?

[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:52.980]
One for Jack.

[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:53.500]
O.J.

[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:53.720]
Princeton.

[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:55.940]
Oh, well, exactly.

[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:56.460]
Good choice.

[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:56.940]
Thank you.

[00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.360]
And I've been a gut to that yet.

[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:00.280]
Very good.

[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.120]
Who is the most despicable murderer of all time?

[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:04.560]
He's right.

[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:04.960]
O.J.

[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.320]
How can we leave O.J. off?

[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.180]
Out of sight out of mind.

[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.320]
He's probably quite legally.

[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:10.940]
579 votes.

[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.780]
He's probably coming up with new scams to steal satellite signals and stuff.

[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:15.220]
He had to make quite on 790.

[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.860]
Oh, is he on there again?

[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.500]
Or is that just one on the hard deal?

[00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.140]
No, he made it.

[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:21.720]
I'll take it one thing.

[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.740]
I think a lot of people like have a one shot deal with O.J.

[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.000]
with him being on the receiving end.

[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.400]
Yeah, that's going to put them over the top.

[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.580]
I mean, you know, when you get down to the bastard and O.J.

[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.120]
and Stu Vazza together, how can we compete with that?

[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:34.560]
My God.

[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:35.800]
He's going to slay us.

[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.100]
Hitler 247, which obviously, I mean, you knew he'd win, but the race, the interesting race,

[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.220]
is for a second place and turn and for it.

[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:49.120]
George W. Bush is a very strong second out, 135, the butcher of Washington, Stalin 45,

[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.800]
the 911 Saudi hijackers, 43.

[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:58.120]
Now you know what I put, Saudi hijackers, because 15 of them were the Saudis hit us and so we attacked the Taliban.

[00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.560]
Didn't do very well and so that we attacked Iraq, the Iraq attack.

[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.460]
Susan Smith 28th had bitch and she's still alive.

[00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:10.160]
Or her neighbors didn't want to put her to death because they were, yeah, right.

[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:11.520]
Bitch.

[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:13.460]
God almighty.

[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.060]
Osama bin Laden only 26.

[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:16.940]
He's small potatoes.

[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.660]
And you remember what Bush would say?

[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.040]
Oh, I don't think about him much anymore.

[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.380]
And all of a sudden, the state of the union, he's like a resurrecting Osama.

[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.200]
Oh, those misrepresentative.

[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.140]
Always good when times get tough, man.

[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.920]
Always bring and schlep out Osama's image once again.

[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:33.780]
And we all get those audio tapes and the video tapes with I'm in the prime in Al Zawak.

[00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:34.280]
You're a Harry.

[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.380]
Andrew 817, she's in the nut house now.

[00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:40.240]
She ought to be pushing up daisies.

[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.700]
Tim McVeigh, he is pushing up pansies.

[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.480]
He's got 16.

[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:44.980]
Chuck Manson 8.

[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.280]
The old Charlie Manson.

[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.020]
Todd Pot 7.

[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.500]
George liked it because it had anything with pot.

[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:54.360]
Ted Bundy 7, Lee Harvey Oswald 5.

[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.400]
He was just a Patsy.

[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.160]
Jack Ruby 2.

[00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.760]
James Earl Ray 1.

[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.240]
James Earl Jones don't have any yet.

[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.520]
David Brickowitz, the son of Sam, had won.

[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.520]
Lea Pulled in Loeb 1.

[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:06.880]
I can't believe anybody.

[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.220]
That's probably Sean because he had it on his pull.

[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.080]
But he sent me this idea.

[00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.940]
Remember they committed the perfect crime or they thought they did it anyway.

[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:15.940]
Who was in that movie?

[00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.180]
I think what's his name?

[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:18.660]
Oh, that guy.

[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:19.380]
Huh?

[00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:20.420]
I don't know.

[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:22.340]
Remember that movie?

[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:22.700]
Nope.

[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.040]
What that was in the movie?

[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:24.980]
Lea Pulled in Loeb.

[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:25.360]
Don't know.

[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:25.840]
I don't know.

[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:26.060]
Leab.

[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.700]
Dean Stockwell was in that movie.

[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.120]
No relation to John Stockwell.

[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.020]
OJ Simpson just went on.

[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.580]
Gary Gilmore don't have any in the Sir Hanser Hand.

[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.060]
Don't have any out of 602.

[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.520]
Do you think these people even know who to hell Sir Hanser Hand is?

[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.120]
Another Patsy, by the way, right?

[00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:43.260]
He was hypnotized.

[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.840]
Just asked Dorothy Krakow and she'd tell you.

[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:46.620]
What?

[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:47.940]
No, he was.

[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:48.680]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.480]
Let me ask you something.

[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.820]
How can there all embolets in the pantry there in the LA in the hotel?

[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.060]
What is that?

[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:55.880]
More than the gun health.

[00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:56.920]
Where did they come from?

[00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:57.860]
Like, was it magnetic?

[00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:58.180]
Oh, no.

[00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:58.800]
I'm not saying.

[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.680]
I'm not doubting that there was more than one person involved, but the whole hit knows that.

[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:03.460]
No, he didn't have them.

[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:03.980]
Give me a break.

[00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:04.640]
You don't.

[00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:05.400]
I don't know for nothing.

[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:06.960]
Are you picking on the A-Rabs again?

[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.980]
Well, you know, I'm going to tell you we already got 13 angry Muslims out there.

[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:12.400]
They're going to come and pick your ass.

[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:19.120]
They're going to, you're going to meet those seven virgins real quick, which I'm sure in your case probably be a blessing.

[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.740]
12 minutes after 10 at 5.

[00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:22.100]
60.

[00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:25.080]
So that's the, yeah, let's, let's build like a whole bunch of different polls today.

[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.060]
I don't know.

[00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:26.500]
I don't know.

[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.220]
And what was that other one I had?

[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:30.060]
What radio showed you?

[00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:31.900]
Listen to it in the morning before 10th.

[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:37.140]
The reason I'm doing that is because now we got Howard's on serious and then Howard the pirate people listening on pirate online.

[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:38.720]
See what I'm saying?

[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.260]
Very much unlike the last time we did that.

[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.500]
And then of course there's Hank, who's on sometimes.

[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.620]
Hey, when it comes to mattresses, there are a lot of gimmicks.

Otherwise known as air mattresses.

[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.160]
Full of hot air.

[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.060]
They're warrantied for only two years.

[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.260]
They squeak, they pop.

[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.220]
Just like that, they can lose their setting during the night.

[00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:58.980]
And they cost you an arm and four legs.

This is 5-60-Q-A-L.

[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:07.480]
Only in the Banana Republic, baby. Only in Miami.

[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.260]
From the maker's report back, Matt, it comes an epic tale of forbidden love on the other side of the valley.

[00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.320]
In Rainbow Reservation.

[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:20.780]
Why you cry, fly, dove?

[00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:25.120]

Rising long-horned Ben Friends since childhood.

It's how you look at me.

[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.840]
How you look at you.

[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:40.260]
The purple feather, broken snuff, the TV decoration, and those long-trip over-mounted...

[00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:46.480]
...spurious, de-prayery like never before, as two Indian friends from rival tribes, the Jack-A-Guy and Lock-A-Jaw Tri.

[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.860]
Spend nights alone in the wilderness.

[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:54.120]
In a TV, eliminated by the flickering campfire and serenaded by the sounds of nature.

[00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:56.960]
Oh, long-horned, oh brown eyes!

[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.040]
Oh, good grief.

[00:13:58.500 --> 00:13:59.700]
I can't milk for you.

[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.340]
Movie critic, rest-read, raise.

[00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:03.340]
Who is that, Jave? Who is your cape?

[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.800]
Rainbow Reservation.

[00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:09.380]
Coming soon to a theater near you.

[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:12.720]
Take a few, if you could, fires at three more or churches in Western Alabama.

[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.060]
I think maybe some angry ragheads done it, don't you?

[00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:16.380]
Yeah, let's say it's that.

[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.620]
Well, you know, the interesting part of that, and I'll get to that in a minute,

[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.580]
because they're just going to be an achievement about that in the various parts of the world,

[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:23.480]
including now Afghanistan.

[00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:26.620]
But it was like a small newspaper.

[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:30.620]
It was like a major Danish newspaper, like a small, like the weekly reader or something.

[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:31.720]
Nobody ever heard of it before.

[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:32.480]
Yeah, like the flyer.

[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.040]
Right, kind of like that.

[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:37.980]
At any rate, oh Diana Crash caused by laser beam.

[00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:39.760]
Here's some more fantastic stuff.

[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.480]
Listen to me, I love this story.

[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.100]
Just calm down.

[00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:46.240]
Well, the guy hypnotized who was the fire in the laser beam.

[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.420]
Yeah, it was a sure hand.

[00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:48.740]
Sure, sure, sure.

[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:49.060]
Sure hand.

[00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:50.340]
It was all sure hand.

[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.980]
The crash that killed Diana, princes of Wales and her lover Doty Foyad.

[00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.260]
See, here's some more ragheads involved in this.

[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.600]
It was caused by a laser beam being flashed in the eyes of their driver.

[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.400]
It's been claimed.

[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:05.480]
It's been claimed that the Virgin Mary's on a Toteinus pizza and the Rosa Lopez house too.

[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.180]
and a lot of people are showing up to see it.

[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.560]
New witnesses, in fact, what is it?

[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.620]
It's the seventh, don't forget a week from yesterday.

[00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:14.420]
Next Monday is the 13th Goat of Rose House in Hollywood

[00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.020]
and see the Virgin Mary on a grilled cheese sandwich.

[00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:21.320]
Just for variety, you don't want to get stale.

[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.100]
I say, let's see, what is this?

[00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:25.300]
We got 16 different poles going on.

[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.680]
Now this waxes the gay guy who ate all of it.

[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.640]
No, and Michigan there would say he's talking about Jeffy Dahmer.

[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.660]
Yeah, he's got it on it.

[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:33.880]
Oh, I see.

[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.220]
Jeffy Dahmer, and then what about what's his name?

[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.500]
The, uh, in Illinois.

[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:40.400]
What's his name?

[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:41.420]
How could I not remember?

[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.400]
John Wayne Gacy.

[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.260]
Oh, yeah, the clowns, everyone loves the clown.

[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.400]
Everybody loves the clown.

[00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:47.600]
That's what Gary Lewis says when he was still speaking.

[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.580]
And I got news for you.

[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.660]
If your father was here, we lose you'd quit talking to.

[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:52.020]
I know.

[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.520]
But it gave me, you'd claim up.

[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.000]
Lady, yeah.

[00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:59.420]
Anyway, new witnesses of total British detectives leading a fresh out.

[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:00.720]
We're getting these on there, by the way, then.

[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:01.020]
Yeah.

[00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:01.540]
Or we're just talking.

[00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:02.400]
Yes.

[00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:06.620]
Leading a fresh inquiry to the fatal August 97 accident they saw a motorcyclist

[00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:09.920]
point the laser into the eyes of the chauffeur on recall who was a little.

[00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:15.100]
52 causing the Mercedes to crash inside the Palm de la la whatever tunnel in Paris.

[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.060]
One witness said he saw an enormous radar like flash of light.

[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.040]
Report, UK newspaper that Ali expressed.

[00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:28.020]
The new evidence supports the arrest of Diana Alphayed and Paul were assassinated by the British

[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:31.960]
Secret Service on behalf of the UK world family who are a bunch of Nazis anyway.

[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.780]
So I should have surprised anybody the Nazis like to kill people.

[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:38.800]
The laser plot came to light as French medics from the hospital where the princess died claims

[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.580]
she was pregnant at the time of the crash.

[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:46.940]
Conspiracy theorist and cis Diana and her lover were killed to avoid the royal family's embarrassment having a child by a Muslim.

[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:53.380]
Alphayet's father, Tycoon, Mohamed Alphayet has always maintained the crash was not an accident.

[00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:56.960]
The investigation is being led by former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Lord Stevens.

[00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.260]
Yadi, Yadi, Yadi is expected to lie to the next year.

[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:00.920]
What are you going?

[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:02.160]
What the fact you had died?

[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.760]
I have no idea in this country.

[00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.780]
Well, in your country here is here they are still like, you know, they can't cut the umbilical cord.

[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:12.020]
They still got the queen on the $20 bill and they still got the, oh God.

[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:14.200]
I forget what they call her.

[00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:19.140]
They got some bitch that's like the representative of the queen who got like a some figurehead title.

[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:20.260]
I can't think of what they call her here.

[00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:21.820]
I call her just a silly as bitch.

[00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:28.200]
Manacuse, this is just a little update on yesterday before we get to fill up these other 15 polls.

[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.120]
I think I'm on a something day. This is good.

[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:32.400]

[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.600]
And then when Elise expected, then we didn't spring one of them polls on our website.

[00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:36.240]
See, yeah.

[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.240]
Manacused in car lot fire resigns from North Miami Beach job.

[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.640]
Well, I guess that was the right thing to do.

[00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:44.220]
Sure.

[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:51.380]
Gerald Giorgetis accused of torching an North Miami Day dealership Saturday because of a dispute over a new car he had purchased.

[00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:54.480]
Resigned yesterday from his job with the city of North Miami Beach.

[00:17:55.500 --> 00:18:00.140]
Giorgetis 56 had managed to book the accident of the city's jewels lit in performing our speed for the last four years.

[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:04.700]
North Miami Beach Mayor Raymond Merrin said Giorgetis handed in his resignation yesterday morning.

[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:09.240]
On Saturday, Giorgetis walked in the metro forward at 900 northwest 7th Avenue.

[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.900]
Upset over the deal he had made for a new Ford escape he was told he couldn't change it.

[00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:17.000]
Giorgetis then got into the car and topped the new car through the showroom glass.

[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.460]
Now sit with a flammable liquid and set it on fire.

[00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:23.020]
Damaging the dealership in as many as a dozen more cars on display.

[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:28.040]
Giorgetis was arrested and charged with first to be arson criminal misstiff and released on $15.00.

[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:31.240]
And the city of North Miami Beach said goodbye and said okay.

[00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:32.880]
Good idea.

[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.180]
Oh, give him more time to go and take out.

[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.420]
He needs to take those anger management classes.

[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:40.480]
Right?

[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:41.360]
Absolutely.

[00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:41.920]
Right now.

[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.200]
I mean, did you say, what's going on?

[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.360]
Now do we get the John Wayne Gacy and Jeffrey Dahmer?

[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.180]
How is so easy to forget there's so many.

[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.340]
What about what the Richard's spec?

[00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:52.560]
What about it?

[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.780]
Not spec spec.

[00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.320]
But do you remember he was called all those nurses in Chicago?

[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:56.700]
Right.

[00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:00.380]
Something about Illinois and then when Wisconsin at whole, that whole area.

[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:01.480]
I don't know how to know.

[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:02.020]
I don't know if you forgot.

[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.480]
Remember we saw the video of him in prison years later.

[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:08.720]
He had grown some boobs and he was doing cocaine off of black men's thighs.

[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:09.540]
Really?

[00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:09.920]
Yeah.

[00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:11.000]
Or that he'd spec?

[00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:11.960]
That's him.

[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:12.980]
I'll be damned.

[00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.460]
He took hormones while he was in prison to grow some boobs.

[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:16.140]
Yeah.

[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.560]
And it only worked.

[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:17.820]

[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.220]
Yeah, it probably made him pretty popular in there.

[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:21.080]
I would imagine.

[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.000]
649 votes.

[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.040]
I already did that pool thing.

[00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:24.540]
So let's see.

[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.540]
Can we, you know, we also got the one for tomorrow.

[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:30.620]
This is great.

[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.320]
Man, we just fell into a bucket of stuff.

[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:33.760]
You know what?

[00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:38.360]
So in other words, if the first five polls don't appear to you, then certainly one of the polls will do it.

[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:41.760]
Where he goes when those stupid polls again, that's all he'd I have right.

[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.020]
Too bad.

[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:43.760]
You love it.

[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.300]
All these belly achres.

[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.560]
Oh, gee, not another.

[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.340]
Now he's doing like six in a time.

[00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.460]
I wouldn't mind doing six in a time when he came right down to it.

[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.520]
X-President Carter says, he's dropping illegal.

[00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:00.480]
Even though, of course, yesterday we had the Irving, Lachez Jr. of Alberto Vio.

[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:03.420]
Five Gonzalez Schwartz lying to his teeth.

[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.040]
I like the fact that you'll buy him, basically, call him a liar.

[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:06.740]
That was good.

[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:07.400]
Nice going, Joe.

[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.720]
Actually, I heard that clip this morning.

[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:08.940]
Yeah.

[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.980]
Every once in a while, Joe butchers up a little bit.

[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.240]
Then he reverts back to being the worst again.

[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:19.720]
But he called him basically a liar, which we need a lot more of that.

[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.840]
We need to know, there's too much bad crap going on right now.

[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:27.580]
And it's about time that Americans in the Congress started acting a lot more like the Canadian and British parliaments.

[00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:28.960]
You know what it starts screaming at each other?

[00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.520]
You heard, I played some clips from the House of Commons.

[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:32.100]
That's great.

[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:32.840]
It's pretty common.

[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.020]
And they're fangin' on the desk.

[00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:35.540]
They're screaming.

[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:36.780]
You can barely hear the speaker.

[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.520]
The British, especially, would have to like all shouting each other down.

[00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:40.220]
It's great.

[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.780]
And the occasional brawl wouldn't be bad.

[00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.200]
Maybe John McCain and Barack Obama are going to get into it.

[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.720]
Now that they were exchanging hostile glances and letters.

[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:53.360]
Former President Jimmy Carter criticized the Bush administration's domestic eavesdropping program yesterday

[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.700]
and said he believes the president has broken the law,

[00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.160]
just like his brother broke it when he was peeing on the side of buildings.

[00:20:59.180 --> 00:20:59.740]
Remember that?

[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:00.900]
He's too much Billy Beer.

[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.460]
I don't think it was legal.

[00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:03.900]
Sure it is.

[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.480]
Under the Bush administration, there's been a disgraceful and illegal decision, Jimmy,

[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:11.220]
said we're not going to let the judges of the Congress or anyone else know that we're spying on the American people,

[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.020]
Carter, to reporters.

[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.980]
And no one knows how many Americans have had their privacy violent under the secret act.

[00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:16.720]
How many million?

[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:17.700]
About 30 million.

[00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:19.260]
We just got the answer right there.

[00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:21.320]
And they may be spying on you right now.

[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.800]
They may be monitoring your calls to your book, to your whorehouse, whatever it might be.

[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.880]
Carter made the remarks at a union hall near Las Vegas,

[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.900]
where his oldest son, Jack Carter, announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate.

[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:37.060]
The former president also rebuked Attorney General Alberto Vio5 Gonzalez for telling Congress

[00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:39.880]
that the spying program is authorized under article 2 of the Constitution

[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:44.720]
and doesn't violate the 78 foreign intelligence surveillance act pastoring Carter's arraying.

[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:48.580]
Gonzalez made the assertions and testimony before the Senate judiciary committee.

[00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:52.740]
It's a ridiculous argument, not only bad, it's ridiculous, said Jimmy,

[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.720]
and a person in his position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.

[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:59.180]
Obviously, the Attorney General has said it's all right to torture prisoners and so forth.

[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.180]
He's going to support the person to put him into orifice,

[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.040]
but he's a very partisan attorney general.

[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:04.800]
There's no doubt that he would say that, Carter said.

[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.980]
I hope eventually the case will go to the Supreme Court.

[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:11.540]
I have no doubt that when it's over, the Supreme Court ruled that voices violated the law,

[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:13.320]
even with the Nazis they got on there now.

[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.140]
The former president said he would testify before the Judiciary Committee have asked,

[00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:20.520]
if my voice is important to the point of the intent of the law that was passed when I was president,

[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:24.000]
I know all about that because it was one of the most important decisions I had to make.

[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.580]
Those move on.org spots are great.

[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:29.660]
Have you seen when you got Nixon and Bush more forget about each other?

[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:29.960]
No.

[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.780]
They're running them all over the place and they're great.

[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.060]
Then of course they had once here, why can't Kira Phillips mend it?

[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.940]
There's another one. She needs to be taken out.

[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:46.200]
Kira Phillips, Dana Bash, Wolf Blitzkrieg, Lou Dodds, they got a whole lineup of Nazis,

[00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:50.280]
card-carrying, full-fledged Nazis, they're running, certainly Nazi news network.

[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:54.740]
Man, and she's on there and they played the clip and then she's critiquing well,

[00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:56.420]
but I mean, it would be an all of a sudden crap.

[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.460]
And like I told you, there's Dick Durbin the other day, well, I wouldn't,

[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.540]
I think it's an inappropriate comparing him to Richard Nixon.

[00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:04.420]
Why the hell is that? Maybe how about to Adolf Hitler?

[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.020]
How about like Morphine, him back and forth with Hitler would be better.

[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:08.060]
With or without the must-have.

[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:08.360]
All right.

[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.260]
Let's see, murderers for the list. Jim Jones, the cool-aid man, I tell you, Richard Spectin,

[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.380]
I just say that very good, Riley.

[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:19.860]
This is Riley who's been way for a little bit, but came back with a vent.

[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:22.600]
Kind of like Rick Riley, he's been away for a long time and people are saying, well,

[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:24.120]
what do we feel so good?

[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:31.200]
Although, Fair Value was, uh, so, Fair Value wanted to down on whatever it was.

[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:35.860]
Jim Jones, the Menenda's brothers, Eric and there was the other one.

[00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:37.460]
And Lyle, over a good.

[00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:42.780]
Lyle, he was kind of Lyle, I love it because he did love it.

[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.900]
Are you brightening these down or not?

[00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:47.640]
Yeah, we're getting the Richard Ramirez, the Night Stalker,

[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.240]
although we did like that show a lot the Night Stalker.

[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.440]
What that was the guy who was on that show, you'll never think of it.

[00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:53.320]
Derrame Gabbon!

[00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:54.180]
Huh?

[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:55.600]
Derrame Gabbon!

[00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:57.000]
Oh, Derrame Gabbon, very good.

[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.040]
Boy, that's shocking.

[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.820]
I was walking the facts over to Josh so that he wouldn't have to worry about it.

[00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:05.160]
John Wayne Gacy, the killer clown, everybody loves the clown and he loved Alan Yolanda.

[00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.640]
The ones who were like hanging out under his house for a few.

[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:08.420]
He liked to eat them too.

[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.060]
The BTK killer, Dennis Raider, we'll put him on here, but I still say, you know,

[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:15.700]
we know the Oakland Raiders, we don't know too much about the BTK killer except,

[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.340]
well, we know where they make that sandwich.

[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:23.560]
It's God Peterson, but he didn't, I don't think so, huh?

[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:24.720]
No.

[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:29.620]
I mean, how do you compare somebody like that who would kind of convicted a killing one person

[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:31.180]
for all these other mass murderers?

[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.600]
I'm sorry, you know, two people, you're not, you're not in that fetus.

[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:34.020]
No.

[00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:35.960]
And Richard Speck.

[00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:41.540]
A lot of murderers out there, a lot of killing, the killing feels, a lot of people killing.

[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:45.240]
Although Bush seems to be in a very solid spot there and second way ahead of Stalin.

[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.000]
Stalin even would kill millions of people.

[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:47.840]
He was small potatoes.

[00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:51.240]
Because we expected him to, you know, because he was a county pincol bad guy.

[00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.280]
Bush was this compassionate conservative Yahoo from Texas.

[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.000]
Who's going to bring decency back in?

[00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:58.500]
In the meantime, he's like a dictator now.

[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:02.320]
He's just making it up as he goes along and all these people are dying for more American soldiers today.

[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:05.260]
And no end in sight, they got chaos and bloodshed violence.

[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:09.200]
And even Christiana Mampur was another shield for the government, for the Pope,

[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:10.520]
for anybody she can shield for.

[00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:12.620]
Even she said, it's madness over there.

[00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:15.180]
It's chaos and the thing is a nightmare is what she said.

[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:16.540]
How do you like that?

[00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:17.180]
Adult?

[00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:19.820]
I'll tell you what you will like in that's terrorist-day chaos.

[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.360]
Whether or not you live near downtown Fort Lauderdale, it's worth those if and on over there.

[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:25.420]
Because terrorist-day-con-labsor house is sensational.

[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.880]
We're talking about not just some kind of a dive, but a really fantastic restaurant on the 17th Street Causeway.

[00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:32.020]
You'll find terrorists.

[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:34.560]
She's there almost every any given night greeting guests that are new.

[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.020]
200 seat restaurant lounge.

[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:40.340]
Probably bringing East Coast residents to the same fantastic, unique terror dining experience

[00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:43.960]
that earned her Marco Island restaurant near perfect marks in his against her way.

[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:47.760]
And a wine spectator award of excellence, wine list, now boasting over 380 selections

[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.060]
from the world's greatest wine regions.

[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:52.940]
The main attraction, though, is you'd expect that terrorist-day-con-labsor house is just what it tells.

[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:53.860]
Just stake in lobster.

[00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:56.440]
Juicy, delicious, they do a fine job with a lot of other things.

[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:56.960]
Two-luck there.

[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.840]
Konyak, confused lobster, bisque.

[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:00.480]
The mom's classic crab cakes.

[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.460]
A great selection of fresh seafood and chops.

[00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:04.320]
A lot of people refer to terraces.

[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:06.380]
The Peter Luger of the South, that's just how good it is.

[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.900]
Saucin and dressings are made fresh in-house every day.

[00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:13.940]
And hand-selected dry-age short loins are used to prepare their signature porterhouse for 1, 2, 3, and 4.

[00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:17.160]
Served cut away from the bone on a sizzling platter at melts in your mouth.

[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:20.820]
Sweet and tender is the only way to describe terrorist-day-six found made lobster collection.

[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:26.220]
They're prepared anyway like a machine, broth, stuff, or lump crab meat or for the, with a filet for the ultimate surf and turf.

[00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:29.940]
And having stone crab season, terrorists quickly becoming these stone crab-house two.

[00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:32.980]
You don't have to fight the traffic and date counter to get those jumbo-as-sweeties.

[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.340]
Make sure to reserve them advanced because they go really fast.

[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:38.820]
Don't miss terraces. Happy hour every Monday through Friday, 2 for 1 specialty drinks.

[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:42.880]
Or their complimentary wine tasting or beef Thursday, 530 to 730 when you stick around for dinner.

[00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:44.880]
It's a fantastic place you're going to love it.

[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:53.200]
Terror steak and lobster house, 1430 southeast, 17th street cause wind for a lottery deal for reservations called 954-765-6202.

[00:26:54.280 --> 00:27:00.080]
954-765-6202 or check them out on the website, terracetakeandlobsterhouse.com.

[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:06.400]
This is Neil Rogers. This is 516 QA.

[00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:10.700]
Average Joe.

[00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:14.440]
Signing on a crumple show.

[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:21.360]
Got a jug up on my toe. And have these guys.

[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:24.280]
Let me in your favorite place.

[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:27.720]
I have read an operator.

[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:34.300]
On today I've ordered extra cherry ice for that day.

[00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:38.680]
Get them fitted for my wings.

[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:42.320]
And you have to learn to sing.

[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.160]
Pour the heart from every chain.

[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:50.720]
And now runs guys.

[00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:54.880]
Speaking of Heaven's Gate, who was that one?

[00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:58.280]
Everybody like sliced off their privates?

[00:27:59.080 --> 00:27:59.520]
I beg your pardon.

[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:00.200]
Oh go.

[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:02.620]
Oh that's right.

[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:03.300]
Was that his name?

[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.900]
That was his fake name.

[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:06.580]
His real name was, I don't know.

[00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:08.280]
Was it Bill Smith or something?

[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:09.280]
Bill Smith.

[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:10.040]
I don't know.

[00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:11.780]
Boy, I still have in like him a lot on the ear.

[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:12.700]
I thought he was terminal.

[00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:13.620]
Doe.

[00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:15.100]
No wonder he was a killing people.

[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:18.200]
John Mahamad, the DC Snackresser, the piece says.

[00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:19.520]
And in fact, let's get him on the right away.

[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.180]
John Mahamad.

[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:23.420]
Although, I don't know if we want to be picking on something I call Mahamad now.

[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:23.660]
You know.

[00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.440]
We don't want to be ragging on Mahamad.

[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.580]
Is that like Macat and Macat on Jesus?

[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:29.560]
Ragging on Mahamad.

[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:31.020]
Okay.

[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.040]
516, and I'll see.

[00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:34.220]
Here's the pull we're going to be doing tomorrow.

[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:41.220]
Oh, I think I'm getting sadistic in my old age.

[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:42.660]
In your old age?

[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:43.240]
Yeah.

[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.660]
Well, I'm tired of being a massacre, so I'm kind of like turning it around.

[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:46.860]
Marshall Apple White.

[00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:47.860]
Yeah.

[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:49.740]
But we never, who would have ever thought of that?

[00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:51.380]
Not me.

[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:51.640]
Right?

[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:52.940]
Not any of us.

[00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:53.800]
I bet you John.

[00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:54.980]
John's probably new with them.

[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.600]
We are from every escape.

[00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:00.860]
Tilt away the silvers, we are black.

[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.280]
Tilt off your nuts.

[00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:04.580]
And the rain's towards toe with that pulsar.

[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:05.460]
There you go.

[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.580]
I can't say cut off your nuts though.

[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.380]
Which of today's pop singers or groups is the worst?

[00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:12.620]
We did this quite a while ago, a long time ago.

[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:15.720]
In fact, I'm sure how long ago was it when the Backstreet boys

[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.720]
and then stink all them boy bands in this, these child, that crap.

[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.380]
Which of today's one of them?

[00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:24.240]
Well, we don't know too many of today's singers or groups because we're not

[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:24.720]
hip-hop.

[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:25.020]
I know.

[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:27.360]
The top 40, not that power 96 stuff.

[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:31.320]
Although we could get a consultant from over there to, you know, Keith White,

[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:31.600]
a loop.

[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:32.840]
A consultant?

[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.280]
I'm winking when I'm saying that.

[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:35.940]
I see.

[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.100]
I don't know that we have a power 96 consultant.

[00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:39.940]
You call that a consultant?

[00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:42.940]
I thought he claimed his desk out and took all the pictures off the wall.

[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.280]
But Josh was telling me the other day.

[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:46.620]
By the way, just so you know, we have two power 96 consultants.

[00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:48.780]
We got a 10 last count, right?

[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:51.120]
Some of the guy with the ponytail, I don't know his name.

[00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:53.920]
Well, that's three then because they're also Greg.

[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:55.640]
Right?

[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:59.940]
We got three consultants over there and they still can't find an audience at any rate.

[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.560]
Which of today's pop singers or groups is the worst?

[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:07.240]
We got from the originalist Puff Daddy, M&M, Gloria Stefan, Brittany Spears,

[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:11.640]
Ricky Martin, who's the latest hit Golden Showers, is zooming to the top.

[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:16.460]
Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, old JLo, and Rick A. Glacias, which I take personal

[00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:17.080]
upfront to that.

[00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:18.280]
Mark A.

[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:20.220]
I don't know that you wouldn't see us out of a paper sack.

[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:25.620]
Madonna, Christina Aguilar, Jamie Foss, we've added, Mary J. Blige, Kelly Clarkson.

[00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:30.640]
I mean, in fact, the Kelly Clarkson's got a song on the top on Billboard Top 100.

[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:34.700]
And Ashley Simpson, who's also in the top 30.

[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:36.720]
And Buster Rhymes.

[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.080]
The reason we're putting Buster Rhymes is because it's a good time.

[00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:43.240]
Because his bling manager, I thought it was shot and killed the other day, Buster Rhymes.

[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:47.640]
And I have no idea if I ever heard of something about Buster Rhymes or if I've seen any of the videos.

[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.320]
Because quite frankly, I don't want to sound like, you know, Buster Rhymes is just fine.

[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:52.380]
Is he really?

[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:52.660]
Yeah.

[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:53.640]
Well, we put him on there anyway.

[00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:58.180]
Robert Blake Foss for bankruptcy.

[00:30:58.500 --> 00:30:59.780]
Boy, it's just like OG all over again.

[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:01.100]
Only in this case, the bitch had a coming.

[00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:02.400]
That's the only difference I see.

[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:03.640]
Right?

[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:04.300]
Right?

[00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:06.180]
Because we all believe that they both done it.

[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:07.940]
But in this case, you know, Bobby Blake got off.

[00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:08.680]
We say, I'll ride.

[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:09.340]
You go, Bobby.

[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:10.420]
All right.

[00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:18.580]
Robert Blake has filed for bankruptcy two and a half months after a civil court jury found he intentionally caused his wife's death and awarded her children 30 million.

[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:20.200]
But 30 million damages.

[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:21.620]
She ain't got to get 30 cents.

[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.560]
Blake was acquitted and marched and criminal court of murdering Bonnie Lee Bayclay.

[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:28.280]
And like we said, she had to come a nice trailer, by the way, Bonnie.

[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:33.960]
And Friday's filing, he listed his big, I tell you, Sigourney Weaver, we're so good in that movie.

[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:34.600]
That's what he was.

[00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:34.760]
It was scary.

[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:37.100]
And see, he was lucky.

[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:41.140]
Because he had a real cool mom who was, you know, again, living a little bit in the past in the 60s.

[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.640]
But that was better than the alternative.

[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.560]
Being like daddy who wasn't living at all.

[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.800]
Who was like Gary, you know, well, the wife was an adulteress.

[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:47.140]
What do you want?

[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:48.640]
Had to raise somebody else.

[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.840]
Like I said, she was living in the 60s again.

[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.120]
Got to raise somebody else's.

[00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:53.040]
Look at it for the good stuff.

[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.040]
Well, she wasn't just that poxy who was looking for.

[00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:56.480]
She was looking for the good stuff.

[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.400]
Obviously he wasn't that a good man.

[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.500]
He wasn't even given the bad stuff.

[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:02.200]
It's a good movie.

[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:05.980]
In the Friday's filing, he listed his biggest liabilities.

[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.300]
That's Bobby Blake as the $30 million judgment.

[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:15.440]
A federal tax bill of 1.2 million and a $334,000 state tax assessment, California.

[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:19.240]
The filing says he has assets of $101,500,000.

[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:20.360]
Well, that's not good math.

[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.700]
Blake's civil attorney said he believes the former tough guy actor is broke.

[00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:26.640]
Otherwise, I wouldn't have written off 200 grand in fees, he said.

[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.460]
The attorney said he can't because he will fees a 250 grand plus cost.

[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:34.720]
The former broadest star's bankruptcy filing indicates he owes the attorney a grand.

[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:36.940]
But Eric Dubin, the attorney represented Blake,

[00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:39.960]
the family of the civil trial, questioned whether Blake is financially destitute.

[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:45.320]
The concept of robber Blake doing everything he had to avoid paying was highly anticipated Dubin said and we're ready for it.

[00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:49.700]
He said Blake's soul, two homes in recent years, he declined to say what he thinks Blake is worth.

[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:52.640]
But said the actor spread his assets around the numerous corporations.

[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:56.800]
He spread it around, you know, kind of like what's your name?

[00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:57.960]
We use the spread it around.

[00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:59.620]
Bonnie Lee, she's spread it around too.

[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:04.640]
Private investigators scout Ross Welp with Blake's criminal offensive, Blake lives off his pension.

[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:06.640]
He's just a retired investor living out of pension.

[00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:08.560]
He can't even afford that cockatoo no more.

[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:14.200]
So let's see, we got the poll on the murderers, we got singers who are just killing us.

[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:17.500]
We got movies that you can watch the Zidian Times like Heat and Imaginary Heroes.

[00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:18.780]
You think they were serious about Heat?

[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:21.660]
Yeah, a lot of people want you to see that movie. Go ahead.

[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:23.140]
They want me to see it?

[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:24.600]
Oh, no, I owe it.

[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:24.920]
I owe it.

[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:25.820]
You hate a VHS.

[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:28.360]
No, it's fine, but it's not to your style. It's a shoot them up.

[00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:30.380]
Oh, well, nothing wrong with shoot them up.

[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.160]
It's just not whatever.

[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:33.780]
I'll send you to VHS if you want.

[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:36.740]
In fact, they're working for a dream. That was a shoot they were shooting up.

[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:37.240]
Yeah.

[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:38.360]
No, you mentioned it.

[00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:41.240]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8.

[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:43.720]
Yeah. Well, it's kind of asked if he asked me.

[00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:47.040]
Town 5, 6, the only Verizon singer, Wakerless Line.

[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:51.020]
Now, let's see, I keep proud to remember because it doesn't make any difference

[00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:53.200]
because Josh just tasted the movie. It's so marginal anyway.

[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.440]
Now, did you see Requiem for a Dream?

[00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:55.400]
It was a great movie.

[00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:56.440]
Oh, thank God.

[00:33:56.600 --> 00:34:00.440]
Boy, if you did knock that movie, Georgia would have come flying through that window

[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.400]
and just kicked your ass.

[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:02.760]
Listen, I don't know what it has to be.

[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:03.200]
Somebody to do that.

[00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:06.060]
Josh has taken fighting lessons, so I would have to hire somebody to do that.

[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:06.980]
You're taking karate lessons?

[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:08.200]
Fighting. I didn't say karate.

[00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.040]
What do you mean fighting lessons? What is that?

[00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:12.260]
What is fighting lessons?

[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:15.280]
You know, fighting when people hit each other in the face with their fists and whatnot.

[00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:17.080]
But I never heard of that expression before.

[00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:17.980]
Fighting lessons?

[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:22.160]
It's like the whole shabang you learn all different things.

[00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:26.180]
But by the way, I don't watch, you know, I got good taste in movies.

[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.340]
But now that you don't have to face the music anymore,

[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:29.940]
whether you have to do that or chew a little bit late,

[00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:31.420]
for what?

[00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:31.940]
Right, you're right.

[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:32.340]
I should have said that.

[00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:34.200]
Just in case Mo comes back and makes Josh.

[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:35.080]
I'll be ready to face him.

[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:35.840]
I'll be ready to face him.

[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.420]
I'll give him a karate chop and he'll be old.

[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:38.580]
A rectum hairpiece.

[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:38.860]
A chop.

[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:39.800]
Yeah.

[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:41.540]
All for him.

[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.000]
He's speaking of bad hair pieces.

[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:47.700]
If you guys have a hair loss problem if you're currently wearing a hair system,

[00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:49.120]
you must listen to this right now.

[00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:52.320]
Charles Alfieur has been supplying and designing hair systems for showbiz people,

[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:56.820]
politicians, big shots, and little shots every day guys like you for over 40 years now,

[00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:57.760]
40 years.

[00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:00.340]
Now most people say you can always spot a hair system.

[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:02.400]
The answer to that is the good ones you'll never spot.

[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:04.300]
The bad ones forget about those.

[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:06.560]
The muskrat sliding down the side of your head.

[00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:12.140]
Who was the guy we saw in TV that one day and it looked like the thing was flopping off the side of his head,

[00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:12.520]
remember that?

[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:13.520]
Jack Horkheimer.

[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.640]
Oh, Miss Horkheimer, that's right.

[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:16.580]
Very good memory.

[00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:19.800]
Miss Horkheimer, she had a rama's grads looking down the side of her head.

[00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:23.120]

And he'll sit your ass down and show you actually how much better and younger he can make you look.

There's nothing like it.

[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:08.940]
So forget about the dangerous pills.

[00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:20.660]
Those awful looking muskrats call today toll-free 1-800-321-2413 and look like a mentioned one-800-321-2413 around the wicked web Charles Alphiere.com.

This is Neil Rogers.

[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:27.120]
This is 516-2-8.

[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:31.820]
Neil God, oh!

[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:37.440]
Where the bag is to friend.

[00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:49.460]
Hey, don't, hey, don't ride like gum and I want the bone.

[00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:53.840]
Chocolate pudding, but got pills.

[00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:57.600]
Oh, I like gum and we want the bone.

[00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:01.580]
Suicide month, it can kill.

[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:05.860]
I like gum and we want the bone.

[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:09.960]
Hey, Mr. Coral, tell me you have the body.

[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:13.560]
Oh, I like gum and we want the bone.

[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:17.460]
He said, hey, Mr. Coral, tell me you have the body.

[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:21.880]
I like gum and we want the bone.

[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:26.380]
Six months after the month, eight months a day.

[00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:29.620]
I like gum and we want the bone.

[00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:34.280]
Six months after the month, eight months a day.

[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:37.840]
I like gum and we want the bone.

[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:43.920]
Hey, Mr. Coral, take this man.

[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:46.160]
I like them and they want to go home.

[00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:46.840]
Hey!

[00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:50.560]
Me, sir, hey, me, sir, hey, me, sir.

[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:53.500]
I like them and they want to go.

[00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:58.020]
A beautiful bunch of purple shouts.

[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:02.340]
I like them and they want to go home.

[00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:05.920]
See, that's the risk in the clouds.

[00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:10.400]
I like them and they want to go home.

[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:14.020]
Sixth man, seventh man, eightth man, sir.

[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:18.420]
I like them and they want to go home.

[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:22.060]
Sixth man, seventh man, eightth man, sir.

[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:26.640]
I like them and they want to go home.

[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:32.480]
Hey! Me, sir, hey, me, sir, hey, me, sir.

[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:39.760]
Right, light on, man, I want to go home.

[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:41.640]
I think he was just hypnotized.

[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:42.420]
Now, what that was his name?

[00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:45.200]
Because I noticed he's the one conspicuously missing from our pool today.

[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:49.340]
Go? Go. Marshall Apple White.

[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:50.960]
I don't see him on there.

[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.100]
Oh, maybe you. Marshall Apple White.

[00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:54.520]
And in parentheses, you put go.

[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:56.860]
Or just home or Simpson.

[00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:59.200]
I was reading that when I looked it up to find his name,

[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.640]
there was this whole big thing on it apparently.

[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:01.920]
He was another closet case.

[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:03.920]
No, that issue.

[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:05.480]
Maybe that's what he was.

[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:07.480]
So involved with everybody's like privates.

[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:10.040]
Some people are concerned with sergeants in general.

[00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:11.760]
He was concerned more like with privates.

[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:14.360]
So there you go.

[00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:17.400]
He'll go on to eventually as soon as the Josh gets around to it.

[00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:18.740]
No food yet today though.

[00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:20.200]
That's probably why he's a little off his feet.

[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:22.620]
That's a good point, which should get something.

[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.440]
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60.

[00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:26.080]
So let's see, we got the mass murders.

[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:29.180]
We got bad singers who are killing us with their awful attempts to sing.

[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:31.600]
We got the movies that you could watch as Igan times.

[00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:34.420]
And what radio show do you listen to with the morning before 10?

[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:36.540]
All right.

[00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:38.900]
Well, you talk about keeping them off balance.

[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:41.320]
Right? Absolutely.

[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:43.440]
So you can be a slip with him for any of those.

[00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:47.500]
In fact, I think by the middle of the slide,

[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:48.820]
time goes for my summer schedule.

[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:50.780]
I have like a poll's all set up for the next three years.

[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:51.700]
That's a good idea.

[00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:53.160]
Talk about being an optimist.

[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:55.740]
Find a way to welcome our new sales manager to QYM.

[00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:56.780]
His name is Chris Jones.

[00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:58.360]
Sounds like a real boy.

[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:02.480]
I mean, Chris Jones, who has worked with Joe Bell for 20 years now.

[00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:06.680]
And he's coming to us from Raleigh, North Carolina,

[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:12.180]
from Ad Street, and Raleigh, they make fun of the people that live where our property is.

[00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:15.100]
Wow. He was a station manager for Clear Channel Raleigh.

[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:15.880]
Oh boy.

[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:18.020]
Here's a guy coming from Team Channel. He's probably a spy.

[00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:19.820]
But anyway, he's good buddies with Joe Bell.

[00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:22.560]
And he's certainly a human, even though he's not even here yet.

[00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:24.600]
At least not full time, a big improvement over what he's, well,

[00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:25.620]
we don't want to go into that.

[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:25.860]
Do we?

[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:27.380]
Like I said, he's a big,

[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:29.220]
company QYM. Hello.

[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:30.680]
Hi there.

[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:31.540]
Yes sir.

[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:33.180]
Just, just most of California.

[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:34.280]
I love this.

[00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:35.080]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:35.940]
Likely story, huh?

[00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:37.160]
Go back.

[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:38.860]
Reverend death.

[00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:40.660]
Company QYM. Hello.

[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:43.280]
QYM.

[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:45.760]
I told you.

[00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:47.340]
Hello.

[00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:48.640]
Oh, I like that.

[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:49.960]
Man, that was good. Let's get that line.

[00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:51.560]
Let's keep that line hooked up all day.

[00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:55.040]
5, 6, 7, we got 15 different polls going on here.

[00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:55.980]
We still got no calls.

[00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.760]
This is just like yesterday all over again.

[00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:00.940]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:03.960]
Tom 5, 60 in the Verizon singular wireless lines.

[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:06.960]
I don't think we're going to make it to that march first at 30th anniversary.

[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:08.980]
I think we're out of business now.

[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:11.140]
I think we like shut our bolt, if I can say that.

[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:11.820]
Like the lightning.

[00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:12.740]
We shut our bolts.

[00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:14.300]
Thanks for waiting.

[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:17.840]
With that big pull and we just exhausted all the energy from this massive audience.

[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:20.180]
And they gave it that one last run and it was it.

[00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:21.780]
That was the end.

[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:24.160]
WQA and echo line. Hello.

[00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:25.320]
I ain't neil.

[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:26.040]
Yes, sir.

[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:26.820]
Are you door.

[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:27.560]
Okay.

[00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:29.860]
I got some good news about all day.

[00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:31.420]
It wasn't all day.

[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:32.520]
You okay, great.

[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:34.420]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:38.720]
I thought this was going over like a halivine man hat and you know what?

[00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:40.060]
Not happening.

[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:42.060]
Boy, oh boy.

[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:43.120]
There must be something going on.

[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:43.900]
You know what I'm telling you about.

[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:46.860]
Like is the transfer directly in the on position where we're conserving energy.

[00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:47.300]
So we're going to do that.

[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:50.300]
Nobody is a senator being in the contrarian.

[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:51.540]
WQA and hello.

[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:52.580]
Hi, Neil.

[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:53.180]
Yep.

[00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:54.280]
First day going.

[00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:54.980]
Okay.

[00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:56.020]
Alrighty.

[00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:58.680]
I just want to ask one thing about that.

[00:41:58.860 --> 00:41:59.280]
Super bowl.

[00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:00.240]
Yeah, okay.

[00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:00.800]
Well, go ahead.

[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:01.980]
That's somebody that cares about it.

[00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:03.820]
5, 6, 7, we're setting.

[00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:05.140]
We have 15 different pulls.

[00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:07.100]
Now we can't get a selection for any of them.

[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:07.440]
That's good.

[00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:08.060]
I'll tell you.

[00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:09.800]
Let's come up with about 20 or 30 more.

[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:11.520]
Okay.

[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:12.080]
All right.

[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:14.420]
And just by accident, whatever they say, there will be a slot for it.

[00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:15.780]
I want one of them.

[00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:17.140]
What do you hate me?

[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:17.360]

[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:19.300]
What up?

[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:22.880]
WQA, M-L-O.

[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:24.980]
I'm Neil Charlene from the back.

[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:26.000]
Oh, I Charlene.

[00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:26.280]
Great.

[00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:27.680]
WQA, M-L-O.

[00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:29.040]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:29.660]
Okay.

[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:32.100]
My movie you can watch over and over again.

[00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:33.100]
I'm being serious, too.

[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:36.000]
It's released in 39 of landmark here for films.

[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:37.080]
The Wizard of Oz.

[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:39.600]
Wizard of Oz you can watch over and over again?

[00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:40.360]
Absolutely.

[00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:41.920]
I don't want to go to Kansas.

[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:42.600]
Absolutely.

[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:45.920]
Okay, that's Wizard of Oz.

[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:47.680]
I guess that tells us a lot about him.

[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:49.120]
In other words, I have no life.

[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:49.400]
Wow.

[00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:52.020]
Would you ever want to consider watching that again?

[00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:53.780]
I'm not just seeing it like 20 times already.

[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:54.400]
I think I'm done.

[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:56.840]
But I'm just saying, would you ever consider watching it again?

[00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:59.480]
I mean, can you ever imagine you're like, you would have children.

[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:01.460]
No, I'm talking about you.

[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:02.300]
Forget about children.

[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:03.660]
Oh, I got my own watch.

[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:04.720]
I'm like, what's on your mind?

[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:06.440]
When you select that one and sit there and watch it like,

[00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:10.440]
day after day after day after day because you're so smitten with it.

[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:12.200]
See, I don't think he understands the question.

[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:14.260]
I'll wait for the remake which ought to be coming out of you.

[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:15.280]
That ought to be fantastic.

[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:16.680]
It lies in an LA.

[00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:17.800]
Yeah, I'll watch the Wiz.

[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:20.400]
She's the only one that could find his neurotic as her mother.

[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:22.400]
WDQ-I-M, hello.

[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:23.780]
Good morning, Neil.

[00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:24.520]
Uh-huh.

[00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:28.900]
On your poll, I would say, before 10 o'clock, I listen to Bob and Tom.

[00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:29.940]
Okay.

[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:31.260]
And I go right to you.

[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:35.600]
And as far as the movie that I can watch all the time is Joe Dirt.

[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:37.620]
Joe Dirt?

[00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:38.360]
Yeah, man.

[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:39.300]
Hey, let me show Neil.

[00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:39.900]
How's it going?

[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:39.980]
Hi.

[00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:40.540]
Hi.

[00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:41.340]
Joe Dirt.

[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:42.440]
You see that?

[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:44.100]
No, and I won't see it.

[00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:44.300]
Why?

[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:46.240]
Who's David Spade movie?

[00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:47.640]
Oh, David Spade.

[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:49.560]
How about a David Soul movie?

[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:50.720]
Don't give up on it.

[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:51.240]
How many say?

[00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:52.500]
I already gave up on it.

[00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:53.320]
David Spade.

[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:54.980]
Can't stand David Spade.

[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:55.520]
I can't stand David Spade.

[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.500]
I don't know anybody who likes David Spade movie.

[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:58.760]
Anybody likes David Spade movie?

[00:43:58.760 --> 00:43:59.600]
No, I can't stand him.

[00:43:59.700 --> 00:43:59.900]
I don't know.

[00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:00.380]
He's got it.

[00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:00.940]
He must be.

[00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:02.300]
There's something going on there.

[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.800]
I think Mama should have been Spade.

[00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:05.260]
Yeah.

[00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:06.900]
WDQ-I-M, hello.

[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:07.880]
Hey, let me show Neil.

[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:08.640]
Let me show you.

[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:08.640]

[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:08.640]

[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:09.260]
This is Neil.

[00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:09.260]

[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:11.000]
Yeah.

[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:13.200]
Yeah.

[00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:16.160]
Are you OK?

[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:17.880]
How about blazing shadows?

[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:19.340]
Don't give up on it.

[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:20.160]
How about it?

[00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:22.420]
That's good on the point.

[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:23.780]
OK, it's great.

[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:24.120]
OK.

[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:24.920]
Oh, my God.

[00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:26.920]
Good thing he finished speaking right there,

[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:28.120]
because I don't think he's going to be with us

[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:28.640]
too much longer.

[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:29.440]
Blazing shadows.

[00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:31.860]
God almighty.

[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:32.420]
Whew.

[00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:33.060]
That's OK.

[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:35.400]
You can be from 9 to 90 on.

[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:37.420]
and it shouldn't be from five to 500, we don't care.

[00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:38.760]
If you got something to say,

[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:39.920]
or even if you don't have something to say,

[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.400]
we invite you to call into the not say.

[00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:42.240]
Make heavens up the state.

[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:42.800]
They don't want to hear.

[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.300]
Okay, let me get to the important stuff.

[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:45.900]
Well, while these people are waiting to figure out,

[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.200]
it's here, they don't get it now.

[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:47.840]
They don't understand.

[00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:49.240]
It's like, huh?

[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:50.600]
Well, what are we supposed to do now?

[00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:52.500]
Whatever you like, whatever you like.

[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.800]
We're here to entertain, to amuse, to kill four hours.

[00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:57.180]
You wanna kill some good time?

[00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:59.460]
Let's play the bird stender 15 times, there you go.

[00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:00.460]
Those were good yesterday.

[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:01.500]
They were killing all right.

[00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:03.820]
They were killing us and themselves.

[00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:06.380]
In fact, hopefully, maybe they finished the job.

[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:08.720]
Curtis Stevens, and again, today,

[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:10.440]
for the second day of the world, maybe that's a trend.

[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:13.380]
Including Jacques Martin at three o'clock.

[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:15.180]
That'll be a two-to-four.

[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:17.720]
Froggy, Jacques Martin, Panthers, coach,

[00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:18.280]
any interest?

[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:18.640]
None.

[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:20.480]
Mad dogs, you're mad at four to seven,

[00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:21.840]
three solid hours, no interruptions.

[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:23.200]
Oh, now look at that.

[00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:25.100]
Says four to seven mandates, and then six to thirty

[00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:25.740]
Panthers preview.

[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:28.720]
This clearance man, this kid calls me again yesterday.

[00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:29.860]
At four, 15 in the afternoon,

[00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:31.820]
I'm sitting there, my own business watching TV,

[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.520]
and the phone rings, it's clearance again.

[00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:36.220]
Totally unnecessary call.

[00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:37.820]
Totally unnecessary.

[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:39.500]
If I wanted to repeat something in a message

[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:41.640]
that never got through before the Joe or anybody else,

[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.460]
wouldn't that like send a follow-up email?

[00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:45.220]
No.

[00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:47.720]
Or call somebody and say something,

[00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:48.340]
Yamama?

[00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:51.160]
But no, God, keep that phone ringing.

[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:53.340]
You gotta keep nudging and nudging and nudging.

[00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:54.940]
That's why people are beginning to hate you

[00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:56.860]
like poison clearance, because you're a nudge.

[00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:57.780]
Nudge.

[00:45:57.860 --> 00:45:59.160]
Nudge, Nudge, Nudge, Nudge.

[00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:01.680]
Anyway, man, dog four to six thirty,

[00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:03.140]
our apologize for clearance is bad.

[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:04.800]
Six thirty is Panthers preview,

[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.440]
probably with Jesse Agler or somebody.

[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:08.420]
And seven o'clock it's the Panthers

[00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:10.080]
at the Washington Caps, ought to be a gimme.

[00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:12.540]
They're crushing about Alexander Ovechkin,

[00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:14.800]
but nevertheless, and Eddie Kay follows the hockey game.

[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:15.880]
That's our award winning lineup.

[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:17.560]
Dary to try to match it.

[00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:18.220]
How do you like the error?

[00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:19.420]
Say they might put the juice on.

[00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:21.760]
I think the OJ Simpson show would be really good.

[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:24.100]
How about having a mom like about six, seven hours a day?

[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:25.100]
Murder tips?

[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:26.820]
How to sharpen a knife?

[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:28.960]
You think my hammer gets people wild.

[00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:33.820]

or just serving your favorite sights.

[00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:56.900]
And we know what those probably are.

[00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:58.860]

In date call 305 Comcast, and of course in 9.5 for Comcast.

[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:34.140]
This is Neil Rogers.

[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.040]
This is 5.16 QA.

[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:41.760]
This is the Neil Rogers show.

[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:44.500]
This is your brain.

[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:47.460]
Any questions?

[00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:49.940]
No.

[00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:00.840]
Yes, there's no use in hanging around.

[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:05.800]
Since everybody puts it out,

[00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:10.200]
because everybody in my school

[00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:15.160]
always tries to play me for the cool.

[00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:21.420]
That's just you, you're a few so matter what I try to do.

[00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:26.360]
Next time that I go to school, I'm shooting you.

[00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:30.880]
They call me names and say I blow round.

[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:35.580]
Now I'm the president's dealing with war.

[00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:40.120]
I'll get my daddies there one day.

[00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:45.000]
Then I'm gonna blow them all away.

[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:51.240]
You think I'd use your own names for matter what I try to do?

[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:56.200]
Next time that I go to school, I'm shooting you.

[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:06.660]
I can't get used to your own names for matter what I try to do.

[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:11.700]
Next time that I go to school, I'm shooting you.

[00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:12.940]
Alright.

[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:17.280]
What about the keyboard and Harris?

[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:19.640]
Was it a die-bow for the voting machine?

[00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:21.440]
The keyboard and Harris from Columbine?

[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:22.940]
That's right.

[00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:25.080]
What do you mean by that's right?

[00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:28.920]
Well, the keyboard and Harris are thinking like a Gilbert and Harris.

[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:31.220]
Are you thinking about Harris and Harris?

[00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:32.880]
Are you into chicken egg man?

[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:33.880]
I think I got a lot in common.

[00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:36.720]
What were you thinking?

[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:42.080]
Like Gilbert and Sullivan, like some sort of a Broadway composer.

[00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:44.840]
People that are in the air.

[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:48.020]
How many times do Gilbert and Ed Solomon have?

[00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:55.840]
Oh, the only reason that's funny is because my grandmother used to call Ed Sullivan Ed Solomon.

[00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:57.600]
Everybody in her was Jewish.

[00:49:58.700 --> 00:49:59.880]
Everybody saw it anyway.

[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:01.740]
Gilbert and Ed Solomon.

[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:04.340]
That's both equally impressive.

[00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:08.300]
My cousin Vinnie says a female listener for the poll on the movies.

[00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:11.960]
And also before he attends, he listens to Magic 102.7.

[00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:14.340]
Also, I put Ryan and Paul on their outer side out of mind.

[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:17.060]
But here's the list I got for that so far.

[00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:19.080]
How about I give you all the 20 different lists I got?

[00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:21.940]
How did I do this?

[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:22.340]
I don't know.

[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:24.420]
Because I wasn't really decided what I was going to do for tomorrow.

[00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:27.680]
So we're just, who knows when we'll do these?

[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:30.000]
Where's Peter there?

[00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:30.680]
Right here.

[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:33.780]
Radio show you listen to before 10 in the morning.

[00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:34.140]
None.

[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:35.220]
Hank.

[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:36.060]
Joe Rose.

[00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:36.760]
NPR.

[00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:38.260]
Howard Stern on Sirius.

[00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:40.220]
Howard Stern pirated like on the Internet.

[00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:42.880]
Y100, power 96, Bob and Tom.

[00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:44.500]
Error America, which I don't know who's on.

[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:44.920]
I don't care.

[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:46.460]
WYOD in the same thing.

[00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:49.880]
Magic 102.7 and Ron and Paul on not so big no-mo.

[00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:51.500]
Oh.

[00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:57.300]
The United Nations evacuated staff and NATO peacekeepers rushed reinforcements to an

[00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:58.960]
Northwest Afghan town.

[00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:03.380]
After deadly fighting erupted during a protest against cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad

[00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:08.860]
officials that this is so assinine and the fact that anybody in the media could possibly justify this.

[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:10.680]
Well, there were very insensitive.

[00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:13.180]
They were right, Yamama, okay, insensitive my ass.

[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:14.560]
So, life.

[00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:17.020]
This business of responding every time you send it, you don't like something.

[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:20.440]
You can get pissed off or you feel you've been offended with all the issues for violence.

[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:25.180]
And if you saw, I need to footage yesterday from Lebanon and some of the stuff from Syria.

[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:28.160]
It's just an excuse to go in a street and act like an allunite.

[00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:29.120]
All the kids are laughing.

[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:32.400]
You know, it's like a big street party is what it is.

[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:33.640]
In fact, one kid was young.

[00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:34.460]
Hardy.

[00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:37.460]
Yeah.

[00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:39.260]
Like most of the time when anybody writes.

[00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:40.180]
Yeah.

[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:41.680]
It's all a big party for the punks.

[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:43.020]
Party for the punks.

[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:47.680]
And while we're at it, we'll kill a few people and burn a few buildings down and have ourselves a gay old time.

[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:49.500]
Yeah, get out of here with this crap.

[00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:53.680]
At least one person was killed and dozens injured in latest Afghan violence,

[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:58.800]
which came as angry protests spread across Asia and has denmarkered the citizens' elite in Indonesia.

[00:51:59.300 --> 00:51:59.860]
Get out of there.

[00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:04.400]
You know, those angry, those great Danes always been considered so dangerous.

[00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:08.200]
The cartoons first appeared in a small Danish newspaper.

[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:12.040]
Remember, printed in several other papers in Europe, Asia, the USA, and the Middle East.

[00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:13.760]
Islam forbid the depictions of one hand.

[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:14.780]
Well, you know, that's up to them.

[00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:15.120]
Fine.

[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:16.260]
You do whatever you want to do.

[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:20.840]
And as far as the rest of us will do whatever we want to do, that's the way the world works, the real world.

[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:28.240]
Tuesday's writing in a remote town of Mamanah was one of about a half a dozen flashpoints that erupted across Afghanistan.

[00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:33.180]
Protesters earned with assault rifles and grenades attacked the NATO base in Mennama,

[00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:35.220]
whatever it is, burning an armored vehicle.

[00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:36.540]
You went carrying guard posts.

[00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:39.300]
A doctorate made Mamanah hospital told AP.

[00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:41.680]
He said one protestor was shot dead and six others wounded.

[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:46.020]
While some 50 others were hurt by tear gas, the peacekeepers used to disperse the demonstrators.

[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:49.320]
We're just quoted in Afghan security officials saying it's four people were dead.

[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:51.340]
18 were murdered in the fighting over a cartoon.

[00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:55.580]
Every time you're going to like, you know, get us pissed off, we're going to kill.

[00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:56.340]
Ah, never, never, never, never.

[00:52:56.340 --> 00:53:00.300]
You like this, and they can't figure out how come the world is like, got what they call this Islamophobia, you know.

[00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:00.640]
Right.

[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:05.660]
Like I said, let's get all the angry Jews and all the angry Arabs together there in the Gaza.

[00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:09.680]
We're going to have to get together in Manhattan, in some Delhi somewhere at Louis and in France.

[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:11.160]
And go ahead and have a good time.

[00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:11.740]
Kill each other.

[00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:12.640]
I believe there is a Islam.

[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.560]
Until there's nobody that wants to kill anybody.

[00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:15.320]
Right. Exactly.

[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:17.180]
Just have a shootout.

[00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:23.380]
You know, the Israelis got the nuclear weapons that they got all the musis and the Palestinians got their rocks.

[00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:25.020]
And I say, nice fair fight.

[00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:27.060]
Just kill each other and leave us alone.

[00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:31.440]
And to show you what a bunch of hypocrites these people are,

[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:36.500]
Iran's largest selling newspaper announced that it's holding a contest on cartoons of the Holocaust

[00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:40.500]
and respond to the publishing of that caricature of Prophet Muhammad.

[00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:41.440]
Yeah, that'll learn of.

[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:42.040]
Yeah.

[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:47.680]
It'll be an international cartoon contest about the Holocaust that ferried more tazabi,

[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:52.880]
the graphic editor for Hamshahiri newspaper, which is published by Turan's conservative municipality.

[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:57.140]
He said the plan was to turn the tables on the assertion that newspapers can print offensive material

[00:53:57.140 --> 00:53:58.400]
and the name of freedom or expression.

[00:53:58.760 --> 00:53:59.900]
You know what? Let him go ahead and print it.

[00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:02.080]
They've been printing this stuff for years anyway.

[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:08.780]
The western papers printed these sacrilegious cartoons on the pretext of freedom or expression.

[00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:14.300]
So let's see if they mean what they say and also print these Holocaust cartoons, he said.

[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:19.160]
Iran's fiercely anti-Israeli regime is the part of a so-called Holocaust revisionist historians

[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:22.500]
who maintain the systematic slaughter by Nazis of mainland Europe's Jews,

[00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:26.000]
as well as other groups who are in WW2s, and they've been invented or exaggerated.

[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:29.000]
Like that, another having a...

[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:30.700]
We're going to...

[00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:32.920]
You are obnoxious, so we're going to out-obnoxious you.

[00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:34.180]
And believe me, I think they win.

[00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:35.460]
I got a great...

[00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:38.160]
I told you this by Christopher Hitchens, one of my least favorite people.

[00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:39.660]
That's what makes it more meaningful.

[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:44.300]
The case for mocking religion by Christopher Hitchens and slate.com.

[00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:48.280]
Let's see, since no one's helping with your murder, I'll pull up the bronies back again.

[00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:50.960]
Jesus, Kate Christ, man, get a life where you're pleased.

[00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:51.760]
I have no life.

[00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:53.600]
Andriyates, that would be timely.

[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:54.740]
I think she's on there, though, isn't she?

[00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:55.340]
I thought so.

[00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:57.220]
Yeah, she just got sent to the nut house.

[00:54:57.380 --> 00:54:57.800]
She's on there.

[00:54:57.960 --> 00:54:59.160]
You better get with it, Riley.

[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:00.400]
Where is she?

[00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:03.740]
Yeah, she's got 21 votes.

[00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:04.500]
She's way up there.

[00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:05.000]
Mm-hmm.

[00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:06.660]
Who's Charles N.G.?

[00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:06.940]
Charles N.

[00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:08.460]
Charles N. He's the...

[00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:11.180]
I guess one of those Vietnamese is that name.

[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:12.240]
They...

[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:15.400]
Him and the buddy kidnapped and tortured a whole bunch of people today.

[00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:15.700]
Yeah.

[00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:17.400]
Suckfully assaulted them, killed them.

[00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:18.840]
Babies, women, things like that.

[00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:19.740]
Well, I didn't put all these on.

[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:21.280]
I Albert J. Salvathe Bossen's Stranger.

[00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:24.540]
Ed Gain is a Gainer.

[00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:26.520]
He was Ed Gain, was at the Green River Killer.

[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:28.080]
I get those all.

[00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:29.540]
No, Ed Gain was the guy that...

[00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:31.040]
You know, that was the...

[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:31.320]
We're right.

[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:32.220]
We have right.

[00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:33.240]
We've ridden a lot of faith.

[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:33.760]
Right.

[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:36.160]
Joseph Mangala.

[00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:38.580]
Yeah, I mean, he was just patching around.

[00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:39.220]
That's right.

[00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:41.080]
He was just conducting experiments.

[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:42.200]
Well, you can put all these on there.

[00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:42.820]
I lean war knows.

[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:44.680]
Charles Whitman, the sniper at the Texas University,

[00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:46.260]
who was up there in a watchtower.

[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:47.520]
With the doors.

[00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:48.380]
I can't watch this.

[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:52.020]
Okay, so anyway, here's this article by Christopher Hitchens on Slate,

[00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:53.680]
who is anything but a...

[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:54.760]
Kami Pincro Liberal.

[00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:59.800]
As well as being a small masterpiece of inarticulously and self-advocation,

[00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:02.560]
whatever that means, these statements from the State Department about this week's

[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:06.580]
International Muslim Program against the Free Press was also accidentally accurate.

[00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:10.180]
Anti-Muslim images are as unacceptable as anti-Semitic images,

[00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:12.740]
as anti-Christian images, or any other religious belief.

[00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:16.020]
Thus, the Hanvelishan McCormick reading painfully, slowly,

[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:18.100]
from what was reported as a prepared government statement.

[00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:21.360]
How appalling for the country of the First Amendment to be represented

[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:22.520]
by such an administration.

[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:24.020]
What does he mean unacceptable?

[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:25.320]
That it should be forbidden?

[00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:29.500]
And how abysmal that a spokesman can't distinguish between criticism of a

[00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:31.280]
belief system and slander against the people?

[00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:34.540]
However, the illiterate McCormick is right in unintentionally comparing racist

[00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:35.360]
levels to religious faiths.

[00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:39.700]
Many people appointed out that the Arab and Muslim press is reprieved with anti-Jewish

[00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:42.320]
caricature, often of the most lurid and hateful kind.

[00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:44.900]
In one way, the comparison is hopelessly inexact.

[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:48.220]
These foul items, mostly apparent countries, were the state decides what is

[00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:49.200]
published abroad cast.

[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:52.320]
However, when Muslims republished the protocols of the elders of Zion,

[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:55.440]
or perpetuate the story of Jewish blood-sacrificed Passover,

[00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:58.160]
they're recycling the fantasies of the Russian Orthodox Christian

[00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:01.960]
secret police, and centuries of Roman Catholic and Lutheran propaganda.

[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:06.520]
And when an Israeli politician refers to Palestinians as snakes or pigs or monkeys,

[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.760]
it is near to a certain that he'll be a rabbi, most usually a rabbi,

[00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:12.540]
auvadi, a yosef, or either of the disgraced Shost party,

[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:14.640]
and will cite Talmudic authority for his racism.

[00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:18.520]
For most of human history, religion and bigotry have been two sides of the same coin

[00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:19.600]
and it still shows.

[00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:23.320]
There are four, there's a strong case for saying that the Danish newspaper,

[00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:27.500]
Islands Posten, and those who've reprinted its efforts out of solidarity,

[00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:31.500]
are affirming the right to criticize not merely Islam, but religion in general.

[00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:35.260]
And the Bush administration has no business at all expressing an opinion on that.

[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:39.340]
If it is to say anything, it's constitutionally obliged to uphold the right and no more.

[00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:42.560]
You can be sure that the relevant European newspapers have also printed their

[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:46.500]
share of cartoons, making fun of nuns and popes, and Messianic is really settlers,

[00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:48.140]
and taunting childraping priests.

[00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:51.720]
There was a time when this would not have been possible, but those tabloos have been broken.

[00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:53.640]
Which is what tabloos are for.

[00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:58.900]
Islam makes very large claims for itself, and its authors are prejudiced against representing the human form at all.

[00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:03.440]
The prohibition on picturing the prophet, who was only another male mammal, is apparently absolute.

[00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:07.560]
So is the prohibition on pork or alcohol or in some Muslim societies, music or dancing.

[00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:10.940]
Very well then, let a good Muslim of Stain rigorously from all of these.

[00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:15.060]
But if he claims the right to make me abstain as well, he offers the clearest possible warning

[00:58:15.060 --> 00:58:16.460]
to prove of an aggressive intent.

[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:20.380]
This current uneasy coexistence is only an interlude, he seems to say.

[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:25.180]
For the moment all I can do is claim to possess absolute truth and demand absolute immunity from criticism.

[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:27.940]
But in the future you'll do what I say and you'll do it on pain of death.

[00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:33.920]
I refuse to be spoken to in that tone of voice, which is it happens I chance to find offensive.

[00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:36.540]
By the way, hasn't the word offensive become really offensive lately?

[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:40.940]
The innate human revulsion against this creation is much older than any monotheism.

[00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:43.540]
It's most powerful expression is antigony of suffocates.

[00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:49.380]
It belongs to civilization. I'm not asking for the right to slaughter a pig in a synagogue or mosque or relieve myself on a holy book.

[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:53.700]
But I will not be told I can't eat pork and I'll not respect those who burn books out of regular basis.

[00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:59.240]
I, too, have strong convictions and beliefs and value the enlightenment above any preserver or sacred fetish object.

[00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:08.340]
It's rewarding to me to breed the same ear as waths from the exhalations of the mud-landrasses or the reeking fumes of the suicide murders of the sermons of Billy Graham and Joseph Ratzinger.

[00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:26.100]
But the same principles of mine also prevent me from reeking random violence on the nearest church or kidnapping a Muslim at random and holding a mahasjid or violating diplomatic immunity by attacking the embassy of the envoys of even the most difficult, despotic Islamic state or making a moronic special in my self threatening blood and fire to far away individuals who may have hurt my feelings.

[00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:35.280]
The baby is rumour-fueled tantrums that erupt all the time, especially in the Islamic world, show yet again that faith belongs to the sport and selfish childhood of our species.

[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:47.500]
As it happens, the cartoons themselves are not very brilliant or very modern either, but if Muslims don't want the alleged profit identified with barbaric acts or adolescent fantasies, they should say publicly that random murder for virgins is not in their religion.

[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:57.600]
And here one runs up against a curious reluctance. In fact, so many Muslim leaders can't even seem to condemn the blowing up of Shi'ed mosque and funeral possessions which even I would describe as sacrilege.

[00:59:57.600 --> 01:00:09.660]
Of course there are many millions of Muslims who do worry about this, and another reason for condemning the idiots at foggy bottom is their assumption dangerous in many ways that the first lynch mob on the scene is actually the genuine voice of the people, there's an insult to Islam if you like.

[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:17.020]
The question of offensiveness is easy to decide, first to pose that we all agree to comport ourselves in order to avoid offending the believers.

[01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:26.420]
How could we ever be sure that we had taken enough precautions? On Saturday, I appeared on CNN which was so terrified of reprisal that it pixelated the very cartoons that its viewers needed to see.

[01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:33.080]
And this ignoble fear in Atlanta, Georgia arose because an illustration of the small Scandinavian newspaper of which nobody had ever heard before.

[01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:37.580]
It is not clear then that those who are determined to be offended will discover a provocation somewhere.

[01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:41.920]
We can't possibly adjust enough to please the fanatics and it's degrading to make the attempt.

[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:48.280]
Second and important enough to be insisted upon can the discussion be carried down without threat of violence or the automatic resort to it?

[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:58.800]
When Salman Rushdie published the Satanic verses in 88, he did so in the hope of forwarding a discussion that was already opening in the Muslim world between extreme, Quranic literalists and those who hoped that text could somehow be interpreted.

[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:10.420]
We know that his own reward was and we sometimes forget that the fatwo was directed not just against sin but against all those involved in its publication which led to the murder of the books Japanese translator and the near deaths of another translator and one publisher.

[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:24.180]
I went on crossfire at one point to debate some spokesman for outrage faith and said that we on our side would happily debate the propriety of using holy writ for literary and artistic purposes but that we would not exchange a word until the person on the other side of the podium had put away as gun.

[01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:32.400]
The menacing Muslim big mouth on the other side refused to force where a state sponsored subordinate of assassination and was of course backed up by the Catholic bigot Pat Buchanan.

[01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:44.440]
The same point holds for international relations there can be no negotiation under the restaurant of the threat of black male and assassination and civil society means that free expression triumphs the emotions of anyone to him free expression might be inconvenient.

[01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:52.320]
It's depressing that have to restate those obvious precepts and it's positively outrageous that the administration should have discarded them at the very first sign of a fight.

[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:57.680]
How do you like that? You go ahead. I just might read that again for tour clause.

[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:03.920]
This is Neil Rogers. This is 5.16.28.

[01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:31.020]
All right.

[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:40.300]
Well I was a Christian soldier of God.

[01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:48.980]
All that time I followed every word of the scriptures.

[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:51.280]
You fairy.

[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:58.000]
It's the power of God living on the winning of my team weight.

[01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:05.000]
Except in 9 to 11 when he must have been gone on a custom holiday.

[01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:12.380]
Take your God and shove it into the name of the corner where you can get no more.

[01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:20.440]
Well the year all right if you're with us because everybody else is wrong.

[01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:24.560]
I'm getting tired of watching people die.

[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:27.300]
The name of it is in the Lord.

[01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:42.000]
Take your God and shove it into the name of it.

[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:47.740]
11.19 at 5.60 WQA. It reminds me of the concept of freedom of speech in the county.

[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:51.600]
You can say whatever you want as long as I don't have an offended by it.

[01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:52.300]
Right.

[01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:59.380]
This idea that people are offended is fine.

[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:02.060]
That's what we have to have freedom of speech.

[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:09.880]
If we all just made nice isn't it a lovely day and whatever you believe whatever you're doing is wonderful.

[01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:13.420]
Anyway here's a fan's it says Jack the Ripper.

[01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:20.180]
And also a very tiny print of says Lizzie Borden and General Sherman and Lieutenant William Kelly of Me,

[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:21.220]
I am an Instagram fan.

[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:25.840]
That's also from Riley but he's not sounding his name because you're Ripley.

[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:27.860]
It's from who? Riley.

[01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:28.880]
Oh Riley.

[01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:31.560]
Oh it's got the same number on there on the header.

[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:33.720]
I'll tell you Riley.

[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:37.220]
The first one is really the distressing and heartbreaking.

[01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:41.820]
See he doesn't want to contribute to the show he wants to do the show.

[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:43.120]
That's the difference.

[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.460]
Let's see here's another fact.

[01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:49.780]
It was reported day on NPR that the political cartoons were originally published four months ago.

[01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:52.760]
Certain clerics asked for a meeting at the time of the newspaper publisher.

[01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:54.920]
This request was either denied or ignored.

[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:59.680]
Then the clerics started circulating cartoons around the Islamic world and the hottest of the hotpads in particular.

[01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:02.280]
They wouldn't have been seen if those clerics hadn't sent them around.

[01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:04.780]
In other words, they were fanning the flames literally.

[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:05.260]
Right.

[01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:08.880]
Fuelling the fire of hysteria, whipping up the masses into a frenzy.

[01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:10.340]
Schmitt the stirbers.

[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:16.080]
And along with the published cartoons, they circulated other cartoons that were never published anywhere and whose origins may be suspect.

[01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:17.620]
In other words, possibly fabricated.

[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:22.520]
In other words, they made them up themselves just to be more incendiary and get everybody whipped up into a freaking frenzy.

[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:26.600]
Therefore all of these riots, all of those violence, could actually be considered as created by,

[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:31.000]
implemented by, incited by, with intent to incite by, the very clerics who were so offended originally.

[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:35.040]
But you won't hear about that in the regular press or from the Islamic commentators either of course.

[01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:35.780]
Well, there you go.

[01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:39.400]
Because our regular press, so called, is irregular, man.

[01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:40.780]
They haven't had a good beer in 10 years.

[01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:41.840]
You see, moved dogs lately?

[01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:43.860]
That lately, I just won good bowel movement.

[01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:47.420]
And the world would be a better place in which to live, even with all those illegal aliens.

[01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:51.600]
Well, he is just, man, just obnoxious.

[01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:53.720]
Talk about a brownie hound.

[01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:57.360]
56670560.

[01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:59.040]
We got 15 different polls going here.

[01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:02.600]
Which everyone suits your fancy or maybe you got an idea for another pool or whatever you want.

[01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:03.200]
You know?

[01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:04.520]
Sure.

[01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:07.140]
We got them all on the ropes today.

[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:09.260]
They didn't know whether the screen or PL16 bananas.

[01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:11.860]
WQAM, hello.

[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:15.120]
QAM.

[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:18.680]
Oh, I mean, WQAM, hello.

[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:19.840]
Good morning, Nails.

[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.400]
Do you have a man to none you list?

[01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:22.640]
Yes, we do.

[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:23.920]
Okay, the mirror man.

[01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:24.380]
The mirror man.

[01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:24.740]
Yes.

[01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:27.880]
56670560.

[01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:29.140]
Now, let's see.

[01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:31.720]
For now, maybe Marilyn Manson, he means for the music list.

[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:33.560]
Okay.

[01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:34.600]
Put him on the phone.

[01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:35.680]
No, no.

[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:35.900]
No, no.

[01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:36.840]
No, no.

[01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:38.480]
No, no.

[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:39.460]
No, no.

[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:39.500]

[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:39.500]

[01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:39.540]

[01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:39.540]

[01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:41.140]
No, no.

[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:43.760]
No, no.

[01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:46.880]
Okay, nice talking to you, too.

[01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:47.480]
What is this week?

[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:49.380]
This is really incredibly week today.

[01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:50.200]
You're just like yesterday.

[01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:53.660]
I'm telling you, I think I should take like about a six month vacation.

[01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:54.900]
I don't know my 30th anniversary.

[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:56.500]
I don't think that's the least I can do for you.

[01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:58.240]
You would have a blast, in fact.

[01:06:58.380 --> 01:06:59.280]
You can pick it up right now.

[01:06:59.380 --> 01:06:59.720]
Here's George.

[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:03.160]
WQAM, hello.

[01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:03.900]
Hey, I'm Julia.

[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:04.300]
How are you doing?

[01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:04.800]
Okay.

[01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:05.760]
Two quick things.

[01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:07.620]
Finish it.

[01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:14.380]
She did better when she's spinning on the roadside by herself, like the guy in front of the tank.

[01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:19.300]
She's on the left wing with a foot too far left now.

[01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:20.040]
I'm going to shove it.

[01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:22.900]
So I just can't give her any credit.

[01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:24.500]
Well, I guess you're opinion, okay, whatever.

[01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:25.780]
Yeah, true.

[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:27.140]
I have a question.

[01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:32.200]
The jerk that did all the damage in the barn, Rhode Island or wherever.

[01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:39.380]
Would you rather have had him killed or seriously messed up an instanding trial and going from there?

[01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:43.400]
Well, I have rather had him killed.

[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:44.240]
What does that mean?

[01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:48.120]
In other words, the outcome that happened, where they killed him.

[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:48.960]
Yeah.

[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:51.080]
Is that unacceptable to you?

[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:51.820]
Would you rather have?

[01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:53.280]
Well, I think he's acceptable to another guy.

[01:07:53.420 --> 01:07:54.840]
I'm the arbiter of what you have.

[01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:56.520]
I think it's great.

[01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:57.640]
I think it's sensational.

[01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:01.540]
You would want to be had him stay in trial, poor.

[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:02.280]
No, absolutely.

[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:04.660]
Well, why should he have to stay in trial?

[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:07.260]
He started when they found him in Arkansas.

[01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:08.720]
He started firing at the police.

[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:10.140]
He was like trying to keep him.

[01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:11.420]
I'm not depending on him.

[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:14.520]
This guy, the guy up there, works up for the incident.

[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:16.140]
The police that they'd rather have seen him.

[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:17.160]
That's tough.

[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:19.420]
I'm real happy that he's a...

[01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:21.980]
He can't get much more messed up than the condition he's in, okay?

[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:24.280]
That's bizarre.

[01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:25.420]
I don't get that.

[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:29.380]
I guess next time they'll have to call me for approval.

[01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:30.840]
I'll give my bat line number.

[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:31.440]
Sure.

[01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:33.580]
Next time they find some slime ball like that.

[01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:36.160]
Call me up and I'll let you know whether we should like, you know,

[01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:37.320]
put them out of...

[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:39.900]
Put the world out of its misery or just, you know, mess them up.

[01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:41.340]
They could buzz your blackberry with it.

[01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:41.800]
There you go.

[01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:43.460]
I guess he was thinking like a thing.

[01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:46.060]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:47.460]
They're coming to pick me away.

[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:48.660]
Good, I hope so.

[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:50.300]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:51.860]
Neil.

[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:52.640]
Yes.

[01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:53.980]
Okay.

[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:57.140]
I used to listen to Howard in the morning,

[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.600]
but he got totally pundit towards the end,

[01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:02.060]
so I listened to Paul and Ron.

[01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:03.680]
I like that.

[01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:04.320]
You don't like them?

[01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:06.260]
I love them, man.

[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:07.180]
I think they're great.

[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:09.560]
Okay.

[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:10.760]
And as far as the movie,

[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:12.060]
now I think there is...

[01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:14.040]
No, do you like them or not?

[01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:15.760]
Do I like who?

[01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:17.040]
The power of mine.

[01:09:17.180 --> 01:09:17.960]
I don't listen to them.

[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:19.120]
I'm not there anyway,

[01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:20.140]
so how can I listen to them?

[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:20.880]
And even if I were there,

[01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:22.120]
I wouldn't listen if you paid me by the man.

[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:22.660]
I'm not...

[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:24.300]
See, you're like the last guy.

[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:25.240]
What do I like?

[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:26.280]
Forget about what I like.

[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:27.420]
Where I see what you like.

[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:28.320]
I pay okay.

[01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:28.540]

[01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:29.040]
You're a painter.

[01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:30.640]
There's nothing to be based on what I like.

[01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:31.820]
Don't be a butlicker.

[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:34.140]
I just like to hear what you're saying.

[01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:34.700]
And this is...

[01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:35.940]
Forget about my thing.

[01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:37.500]
Okay. There's nothing much to worry about.

[01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:38.760]
Okay. And what was the one for the movie?

[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:40.520]
Now, believe it or not,

[01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:42.080]
this is a classic for me.

[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:44.260]
And I can watch it a million times

[01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:45.860]
and laugh hysterically.

[01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:47.760]
Playing trains and automobiles.

[01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:51.360]
Yeah.

[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:51.800]
Come on.

[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:52.640]
Yeah.

[01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:53.740]
What do you think?

[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:54.700]
Well, that was your dream,

[01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:55.340]
made that not me.

[01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:57.280]
I never seen that piece of crap in that movie.

[01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:58.240]
Are you kidding me?

[01:09:58.380 --> 01:09:59.360]
It's a classic.

[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:01.540]
You can laugh 100 times every time.

[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:03.760]
It was okay.

[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:04.240]
You don't have once.

[01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:05.040]
Yeah.

[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:06.440]
No, it's...

[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:07.400]
I don't know what it is.

[01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:09.500]
Sometimes movies you have to see a couple times before.

[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:11.260]
You can really get into it.

[01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:13.380]
Like, I've actually seen a movie falling asleep.

[01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:14.260]
And then it's...

[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:16.580]
Why, it's the second time, and I love it.

[01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:18.380]
And then the more I watch it, the more I like it.

[01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:18.880]
I don't know why.

[01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:19.120]
Right.

[01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:20.660]
I think I don't know what I'm gonna do.

[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:22.980]
And then Josh is gonna watch the network again.

[01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:23.840]
About four or five times.

[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:24.400]
Maybe he'll like it.

[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:24.900]
He'll like it.

[01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:25.500]
Right.

[01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:26.700]
That's a good idea.

[01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:27.880]
It doesn't know if you hate like poison.

[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:28.600]
Keep watching it.

[01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:30.300]
And after about 15, 20 a time,

[01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:31.400]
you'll start liking it a little bit.

[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:32.800]
And you'll start like...

[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:33.840]
Milding the dialogue.

[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:34.760]
You know it by heart.

[01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:36.280]
Card two.

[01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:37.100]
Card two.

[01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:39.100]
I'm not gonna erase it.

[01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:39.300]

[01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:41.300]
Yeah, good to see you.

[01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:41.620]
Not now.

[01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:44.980]
Maybe Jack Walts was like a little on the psychic side.

[01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:47.560]
26 past 11.

[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:48.520]
We got Kurdish today.

[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:50.100]
And then of course, I got shot at Martin Jo.

[01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:51.160]
That's a guaranteed tune.

[01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:53.640]
This is Mild Roger.

[01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:57.600]
This is 5.62.8.

[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:01.500]
Kill Nicole.

[01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:02.660]
Well, congratulations.

[01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:03.440]
Get a life.

[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:07.920]
One step closer to being a bad guy.

[01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:10.280]
Maddox and babies are on our own now, have his name.

[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.960]
But is it the first step to miss when this is Smith?

[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:14.620]
Becoming Mr. and Mrs. P.

[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:16.100]
How long will it take?

[01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:20.040]
Till we get a break.

[01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:20.960]
You get break.

[01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:25.320]
From the coverage of Brad and the mother to be.

[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:26.580]
They're too new.

[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:29.860]
Good, didn't Hollywood even before Brad and she had their baby.

[01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:31.440]
No other story.

[01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:35.440]
Get the real boring.

[01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:37.060]
I'm just bored today.

[01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:39.920]
I've heard a lot of this fair.

[01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:40.840]
How about you?

[01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:41.780]
Italy is clear.

[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:42.380]
It's not easy.

[01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:43.740]
The hardest people may for now.

[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:45.100]
Especially to eat.

[01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:45.460]
Yeah.

[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:49.020]
Say that Hollywood is fragile enough.

[01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:52.400]
A lot of people have just big grants at the age range.

[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:56.320]
Who is the Brad and Angelina of a soul?

[01:11:56.780 --> 01:12:00.360]
But our Mr. and Mrs. Smith already living happily ever after.

[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:02.340]
They have to be after baby.

[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:05.280]
Their faces go through.

[01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:07.880]
We're E.M.I.N.O.

[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.400]
To the floor.

[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:11.720]
We have to have Lloyd's ball.

[01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:13.980]
But we've got more Brad and Angelina dish.

[01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:16.160]
Brad, what's your ambassador kind of now?

[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:16.960]
I was a little pile.

[01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:18.280]
I was always fast.

[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:18.940]
Really?

[01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:19.780]
Fascinating.

[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:20.720]
I'll tell you one thing.

[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:25.180]
Anybody that's on those shows, talk about this, all this Muslim, this history, that's going on.

[01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:28.860]
Anybody that's on those entertainment tonight, an inside division, an outside division,

[01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:32.560]
and Hollywood inside or all of this stuff, they all ought to be around it up.

[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:33.580]
And then what?

[01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:34.420]
I don't know.

[01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:34.960]
You figured it out.

[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:36.760]
Ask that guy to call me a couple of calls ago.

[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:38.900]
Get him to call me on the bat line.

[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:39.680]
I'll give you my verdict.

[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:46.120]
The celebrity phenomenon dubbed Brand Angelina has triggered immediate fever surrounding Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.

[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:49.100]
That some observers say has reached the point of insanity.

[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:49.620]
Absolutely.

[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:54.620]
Far overshadowing the hoopla that attended such make-believe couples as Benefer and Tomcat.

[01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:56.900]
You know, Ben Affleck and Tom Cruise.

[01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:57.680]
You're fairy.

[01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:02.900]
The tourist confirmation last month that Jolie was pregnant by her co-star Pitt was proofed

[01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:05.340]
to the media of a love affair that either stars publicly acknowledged.

[01:13:05.620 --> 01:13:07.780]
Well, either they're made with his immaculate contraception, you think?

[01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:09.160]
Oh, yeah.

[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:09.860]
It was immaculate.

[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:14.440]
Depending on which TV show you'll listen to or which celebrity magazine or gossip calm you read,

[01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:19.420]
Jolie is expecting a girl, no, a boy, no twins, the pair of plans of Valentine's Day wedding in Malibu,

[01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:23.720]
or possibly a George Clooney's Italian villa, unless they've already married in a secret Buddhist ceremony.

[01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:28.320]
They're also reported to have hired British celebrity chief Jamie Oliver to do the catering.

[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:32.720]
Landonis has been guy richy to be the best man and a commission in a Italian jeweler to come up with a ring.

[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.140]
Or does the self-reasquer winning actress or possibly Pitt have cool feet about time that ought,

[01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:43.220]
whoever said that marriage was imminent anyway, and his brad's ex-wife Jennifer Aniston devastated her happily moving on.

[01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:47.620]
Jolie, twice married and Pitt, who's divorced last year from popular friend star Aniston,

[01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:51.960]
has spiced up the story having remained tight-lived merely fueling the speculation.

[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:52.800]
He's tight-lived.

[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:54.460]
What's the new fall?

[01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:57.140]
We're not talking about it.

[01:13:57.220 --> 01:13:58.080]
We don't want any more stories.

[01:13:58.240 --> 01:13:59.440]
We just want people to leave them alone.

[01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:02.540]
Pitt's publicist Cindy Guagenti told Reuters.

[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:06.620]
Guagenti said there was no truth to her in broad and imminent sadness wedding outing cryptically.

[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:07.540]
They're not getting married.

[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:08.920]
I don't want to story about them getting married.

[01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:10.480]
I think you guys should just drop the whole thing.

[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:13.660]
Some hope it says there isn't even a branchaleted.net website.

[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:22.620]
There's always been a certain fascination with celebrity, but today's proliferation of outlets has seemed to be competing for the same photos and stories that reach the point that seemed insane.

[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:27.140]
Said PR consultant Ken Sunshine, whose clients include several celebrities.

[01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:28.320]
Ken Sunshine.

[01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:29.720]
Any relation?

[01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:30.760]
Yeah.

[01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:43.480]
Every time magazine is acknowledged the deafening noise carrying the deeply satirical cartoon last week that featured the Jolie pregnancy news and wedding rumors as new methods of torture for prisoners of war.

[01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:45.820]
Even beats those Celine Dion records.

[01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:56.380]
Robert Thompson, director of the Center for the Study of Popular Television, said the coupling of a list stars like Pitt and Jolie, or years gone by, Liz Taylor and Richard Burton, was a paparazzi's dream come true.

[01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:02.440]
Now most of these people don't know the difference between a paparazzi and a present event.

[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:06.340]
See there you go again with that Godfather crap, not a present event.

[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:13.280]
As silly as it sounds, the new tendency to make up single names for two people like Benefer and Tom Kat is an insightful idea.

[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:16.480]
Brangelina has more cultural equity than their two star parts.

[01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:19.640]
You get interested in this one he wants to run out of his fiasmosis.

[01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:20.800]
They said, I don't think so.

[01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:21.480]
Are you interested?

[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:21.980]
No.

[01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:24.920]
Sunshine said none of us care.

[01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:28.660]
At all, not even a little teeny tiny bit.

[01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:34.140]
Mostly desperate housewives with no life where tired of watching Oprah with phoning authors on.

[01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:35.280]
They got to do something.

[01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:41.300]
Five six seven oh five sixty we're building about 15 different polls here today including old totem.

[01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.100]
Let's go to totem pool. What do you say?

[01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:44.900]
You build it and I'll totem.

[01:15:45.260 --> 01:15:45.480]
Yeah.

[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:46.760]
You float them?

[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:51.180]
524 votes on the pool.

[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:53.280]
Who is the most despicable murder of all time?

[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:54.500]
Hitler we knew would win.

[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:55.600]
371.

[01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:59.380]
Heck of a launch there, so a fraction plate.

[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:04.840]
George W. Bush 22 the butcher of Washington doing a very commendable job on his own.

[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:10.460]
Stalin 71 911 Saudi hijackers 62 we left the four Egyptians off.

[01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:15.300]
Susan Smith 39 or some of it live in 31 we don't think about him much anymore.

[01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:17.480]
Unless it's the state of union.

[01:16:18.180 --> 01:16:21.040]
Oh there's Barack Obama and John McCain with his big cheek.

[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:22.920]
I'm going to be finished.

[01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:26.220]
Yeah but it would be okay you lost both of them.

[01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:31.960]
10th grade 27 and re-8th 22 OJ 17 we hate you OJ go steal some more satellite signals.

[01:16:32.820 --> 01:16:36.560]
Paul pot 16 Jeffrey Dahmer O Jeff Dahmer excuse me eight.

[01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:41.580]
Yeah but he I think he's hanging out with father Gagan these days.

[01:16:41.940 --> 01:16:42.300]
Yeah.

[01:19:29.780 --> 01:19:35.720]
Well didn't kill anybody probably but who just had one on my mind and just looked away.

[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:37.680]
Damn it.

[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:38.320]
They have it.

[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:38.580]

You want to put him on there?

[01:19:58.060 --> 01:19:58.860]
We'll put them on there.

[01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:02.720]
I think they got to kill more than one person to be qualified for this list so don't put him on there please.

[01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:04.980]
What he put him on there already.

[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:06.280]
No I think we caught him in town.

[01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:07.260]
Don't do it.

[01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:12.320]
Don't do it man you're a young man you got your whole life ahead of you.

[01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:15.840]
Remember that take me to the foot of the George Washington Bridge but that's right you hated that movie I'm sorry.

[01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:16.460]
Sorry.

[01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:23.760]
Now see ordinarily I could put that movie on there and at least about one I could watch this engine times and I have seen him many many times but it's not it's just not the same color.

[01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:28.100]
And you're going to say to me imaginary heroes I don't even know what movie that work.

[01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:30.680]
That was the take take me to the George Washington Bridge.

[01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:35.760]
Yeah I don't remember in the very beginning of the movie during the bar William Holden and Peter Fransley were in the bar and are getting drunk.

[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:42.200]
Right and then they're standing outside afterwards in fact later in the movie he tells the same story again they're all gathered around in the newsroom.

[01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:48.840]
Howard Beale just got yanked off the air and they just had the big meeting you know all the big haunchers about whether to put it back on the air or not.

[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:55.500]
And Nelson stands up well the New York Times is going to be out right and then Robert Dubell says the New York Times doesn't advertise on this network.

[01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:58.580]
Sit down Nelson your outrageous duly noted remember that I do.

[01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:07.100]
Boy I know the I know the dialogue man word for word but they don't remember the drugs standing outside the bar.

[01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:08.460]
I have to go with some other movie.

[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:14.760]
Not that I can Disney right off the air get a 90 share easy talk about the suicide of the week terrorists of the week remember.

[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:22.020]
Yep and they're standing outside he tells the story about giving a used post to do a remote broadcast at the foot of the George Washington bridge.

[01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:30.920]
That's right and he gets in the cab and says hey cabby take me to the foot of the George Washington bridge and the cab driver looks at him and says oh hey pal you're a young guy you got your whole life I had to get don't do it.

[01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:34.000]
Wow you had to be there you remember that don't you.

[01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:41.040]
How about you even Josh remembers that scene I do well wasn't like a wedding proposal or anything I just said you probably remember the scene.

[01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:44.960]
That's apart from God from a network he liked and from Godfather too.

[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:48.440]
That I liked you didn't like that scene in the beginning.

[01:21:48.860 --> 01:21:51.600]
I don't like anything about why you didn't like the movie okay.

[01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:56.860]
Hey look I told you the message was the only part you like was when fade that way was mounting William Holman hold him that part you like.

[01:21:56.980 --> 01:21:58.360]
Yeah something about a 30 share there.

[01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:01.100]
No we said 30 share.

[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:03.700]
What ever he said.

[01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:09.420]
Just not your kind of movie okay just didn't have enough I don't know what your kind of movie is I don't know.

[01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:15.180]
Just want to keep me awake that's okay I'll take a one thing don't give him my imaginary heroes you won't like that he'll say that that's like a fact movie or something.

[01:22:15.740 --> 01:22:17.900]
No you know he wouldn't like it he won't like it.

[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:22.260]
I could watch that movie every day it just it rings several bells with me of course you know.

[01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:24.000]
Yeah exactly.

[01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:33.500]
In fact I admit this to you last night but as well I already was on the cable no listen and my TV my cable you can if you're watching a show on a channel.

[01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:40.760]
It's like it's not recording it unless you said it to record but you can like rewind you know I'm saying right like a Tivo kind of it right right.

[01:22:40.940 --> 01:22:45.760]
And the scene there toward the end of the movie after he plays the piano we several of the grad high school graduation.

[01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:53.360]
And they're sitting on the bench and he's talking about the fact he let his brother commit suicide which I'm not giving anything away because that's in the very beginning of the movie we know the brother commit suicide.

[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:57.820]
And his boyfriend I mean his step his half brother.

[01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:05.520]
What and now you are giving away what their business is to make it to guys whether they're related not is that like a dollar.

[01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:08.940]
It's like the brothers never give it around with each other like cousin or stuff like that.

[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:11.900]
I mean it's already icky enough that they're gay it really doesn't matter that they're kin.

[01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:16.720]
I see anyway and he says to a model not everybody can be heroes.

[01:23:18.220 --> 01:23:24.680]
Right right can be a hero and he says and he says yeah I guess you're right and he reaches over puts his hand out of shoulder.

[01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:33.180]
Okay now I will admit here that I watched that three times when I saw because there's a message there okay it's very quick and very subtle that's how much it took.

[01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:36.320]
Three yeah now three seconds that was enough for me.

[01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:43.800]
So and see there now guarantee that Josh won't watch that movie now which is unfortunate because it's really good what there's nothing.

[01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:52.200]
So he thinks it's not that's not that's not what the movie's about okay no it's not you are so insecure man forgot it's that got his Russian Natasha girlfriend there like

[01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:54.820]
do and hanky banky 15 20 times a day.

[01:23:56.880 --> 01:24:05.320]
Yeah but it's not with guys well what's the difference is to make are they doing anything that's right there is that one that very very lengthy kiss.

[01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:08.460]
Instead of rewinding three times I'll fast forward.

[01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:11.520]
Yeah you know what we'll start editing movies you know for people.

[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:14.480]
Yeah for people to get really uptight about like a little kiss.

[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:19.320]
I guess you're not going to be out and you know I'll watch that now that I know that there's nudity in it that what they have.

[01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:20.460]
Halfway in the show.

[01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:24.760]
Let's see if Josh will watch that because there's some heavy-duty female nudity in their boobies baby huh.

[01:24:24.980 --> 01:24:27.640]
Yeah but then they can just fast forward to all that the Fagory in there.

[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:30.060]
This is Neil Roger.

[01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:31.660]
There were the Rough Riders.

[01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:32.940]
He's 560.

[01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:33.640]
Let go.

[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:38.380]
The Roger's got it.

[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:50.140]
The Role from their tag now come to have hope chat to chat.

[01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:58.040]
There's not much strange about them outside their garden strats.

[01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:02.180]
Way back then in the Christian West.

[01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:09.600]
Red beds were day-to-day with man's legs wrapped around them.

[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:12.020]
Hey we're with Cowboys right.

[01:25:13.340 --> 01:25:21.680]
We're with the bullets fired from the gun state shoot with double-fisted fun.

[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:29.280]
There's another big Cowboys shoot John Wayne was Mary Young.

[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:33.540]
His name was Mary Young.

[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:41.260]
Hey Role from their tag now come to bring me Cowboy guys.

[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:51.640]
On Saturday come Mountain with some help from Asteroid.

[01:25:55.740 --> 01:26:00.520]
That's another reason Josh would like impossible heroes.

[01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:03.540]
Is that imaginary?

[01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:06.360]
Is because nobody dies in the end.

[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.040]
What the hell does that matter?

[01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:11.480]
Well like Donnie Darko you're like a lot because he died in the end.

[01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:13.320]
You're just setting up a joke there Josh.

[01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:14.600]
Yeah I see.

[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:18.900]
And anyway and I was very pleased the reason I rewinded it three times.

[01:26:18.900 --> 01:26:21.660]
I want to make sure that when he put his hand on the shoulder was like a masculine.

[01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:24.400]
Like it was a good solid squeeze.

[01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:27.060]
As opposed to what I'm talking about.

[01:26:28.340 --> 01:26:32.040]
Well he did seem a little the more you watched that kid it kind of like switch your he seemed to be.

[01:26:32.260 --> 01:26:34.040]
I'll be able to work up that next morning.

[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:34.540]
I beg your pardon?

[01:26:34.740 --> 01:26:35.420]
I'll not but you are.

[01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:35.800]
Yeah right.

[01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:38.220]
Yeah it makes sense you are.

[01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:39.260]
But I'm definitely not.

[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:40.520]
And then I'm right.

[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:43.500]
Yeah I've heard that one before.

[01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:48.900]
I'm sure the widow of Dr. Rankins donate $16,000 to students who refuse to sell candy.

[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:50.160]
Let's hear it for those kids.

[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:55.540]
Okay they know John Jaros thank God who sent that stupid milk bar up here a couple weeks ago and then you're killed me.

[01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:58.000]
And my blood sugar up to 325 in the middle of the show.

[01:26:58.260 --> 01:27:00.860]
I hope he's embarrassed and he really didn't degrade what an idiot he is.

[01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:03.240]
And stop using as an excuse.

[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:04.840]
I'll try to do something nice.

[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:05.580]
No you're not.

[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:07.720]
You're in denial.

[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:09.700]
Typical Nazi move man.

[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:10.900]
We're trying to do something nice for you.

[01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:11.120]
Okay.

[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:13.660]
Who wouldn't pass up an ice free shower right?

[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:15.700]
Depend on who it's with.

[01:27:16.300 --> 01:27:19.480]
The widow of the man who created the how about Emil Hirsch?

[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:21.220]
You can take my turn.

[01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:21.940]
Okay.

[01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:30.160]
The widow of the man who created the Atkins dot is promised a $16,000 check to afford a lot of elementary school ensuring students are refused to sell on a healthy snacks.

[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:33.300]
As a fundraiser can still take their field trip to Washington DC.

[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:35.400]
You go lady whatever her name is.

[01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:36.060]
Veronica.

[01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:41.380]
After running the important selection site and eating healthy in a country wellness program,

[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:46.300]
county wellness program students in Northside Elementary refused to sell candy to raise the field trip money.

[01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:48.140]
A decision that scartered national attention.

[01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:51.100]
This of course is in Florida.

[01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:55.500]
Veronica Atkins whose late husband Dr. Bob Atkins my close personal friend.

[01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:58.220]
Remember that wonderful appearance were you there that day at the end?

[01:27:58.260 --> 01:27:59.220]
I was there on their voices.

[01:27:59.220 --> 01:27:59.740]
Is he in?

[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:00.100]

[01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:01.200]
I was there.

[01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:02.180]
It's always the guy with the eyes.

[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:04.760]
Oh well nothing's perfect.

[01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:10.580]
Whose husband Dr. Bob Atkins started the country's low carb craze which is vanished by the way.

[01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:14.300]
And that's a shame too because it really is great even if you don't lose any weight on it.

[01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:16.140]
It's very good for your blood lipids.

[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:23.240]
Found out about the students refusal and intends to dip into proceeds of the foundation which promotes her omission to combat type 2 diabetes.

[01:28:24.060 --> 01:28:28.580]
I was so proud when the children said you're telling us not to go out and eat sugar and then you ask us to sell it.

[01:28:28.660 --> 01:28:30.180]
Atkins said money from her home in West Palm.

[01:28:30.540 --> 01:28:32.940]
I said no way am I going to let them down now let them go on the field trip.

[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:43.140]
Atkins 68 and her trust the Clive Mets of Aventura planted had a had a check tomorrow morning to Northside Principal Michelle Valbrune Pope.

[01:28:43.980 --> 01:28:49.940]
Veronica atkins sold Atkins nutritional after husband of the company's founder died in April 2003 after he had a bad fall on a sidewalk.

[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:51.720]
Marks where you walk in Bobby.

[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:53.240]
Oh there he goes.

[01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:54.300]
It is hate.

[01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:59.300]
Veronica atkins donation make the Washington DC trip possible for 36 fifth graders.

[01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:04.840]
If the school receives more money more fifth graders who hadn't tied the ticket to the field trip maybe over to Georgia donate a few grand.

[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:09.380]
The school still needs to raise about 8 grand to send the fourth graders on the telehazzy field trip.

[01:29:09.700 --> 01:29:11.660]
Teacher Monique Managat said.

[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:23.080]
Atkins largest wasn't the only donation of the school since last Friday the school has received about 100 emails from Uganda the Chicago dozens of phone calls and personal trust including one from for 6 grand from anonymous donor.

[01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:27.900]
Because they refuse to sell chocolate door to door because it's bad for you.

[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:37.780]
Those who let them go sell solve okay that's bad for your blood pressure too but you know Morton Salt like when I was in school don't ask me why we sold that I have no idea because that's the told us to that's kind of strange.

[01:29:38.140 --> 01:29:47.580]
What selling salt I had eyes yeah Morton salt box of salt but somebody I don't know why when you're in school you do whatever they tell you to okay.

[01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:52.600]
Apparently like so many this kid said we're not going to do it give them some credit okay give them some props.

[01:29:53.900 --> 01:30:07.120]
Yo those who didn't offer money shared ideas man again since you see several fundraising opportunities from selling Ava to an idea from a Melbourne man who offered to pedal so made barbecue sauce for the cause that's probably give you bad Roy's man homemade barbecue sauce my ass.

[01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:11.680]
The children are amazed they're like really really people from all over the country are helping us.

[01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:14.840]
All right for an ice ice gone kids.

[01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:24.340]
In fact some of the classmates are excited about the media attention that we see since Friday a woman a little girl to her name is what's definitely August.

[01:30:25.540 --> 01:30:33.400]
Give an interview to a New York City radio station the school is president from CNN and a phone call from the Tony Danza showed us we've proven enough it nothing is perfect.

[01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:44.300]
Once you made the Tony Danza show that tells you don't do it again five six seven oh five six we got 16 different polls were building they were building him okay for future use.

[01:30:47.260 --> 01:30:53.400]

[01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:11.820]
Yes sir

[01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:14.080]
Q.A.M.?

[01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:14.780]
Q.A.M.?

[01:39:14.780 --> 01:39:15.160]
Q.A.M.? Yes

[01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:19.040]
Oh, that's a night down the hill, it's got the Rick Sanchez on the pole

[01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:22.360]
Yeah, I had a little bit of it

[01:39:23.140 --> 01:39:27.020]
That was funny, he mentioned it because I actually saw Rick and he said he had an accident last night

[01:39:27.020 --> 01:39:28.900]
And that's why I changed the channel real fast

[01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:34.120]
I'm certainly not seeing news network and I flipped around on the channel that's when I thought imaginary heroes again

[01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:36.360]
Not everybody can be a hero

[01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:39.360]
Right

[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:42.500]
Now maybe you can explain something to me, do my best

[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:46.660]
Because I watched it movie 3-2 and a half times now, but I watched it

[01:39:46.660 --> 01:39:50.840]
And he's got all these scars from being beaten all the time

[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:52.840]
Now we know that in the school, huh?

[01:39:53.180 --> 01:39:54.060]
Bruises and what not, right?

[01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:55.680]
Bruises and scars and marks

[01:39:55.680 --> 01:39:57.640]
Kid in school was beaten on him

[01:39:57.640 --> 01:39:58.020]
Right

[01:39:58.020 --> 01:39:59.320]
And the brother too

[01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:00.100]
Right

[01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:06.360]
Remember when the brother says did I, we walked away and he's got his shorts on and he like pulls them down a little bit

[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:08.920]
Not too far now, uh, amel

[01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:14.280]
And to cover up the bruises and the brother says did I do that? And he nods like yeah

[01:40:14.740 --> 01:40:16.040]
He's getting beaten up by everybody

[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:16.680]
That's right

[01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:19.040]
Well he's a little faggot, you know, that's what happens

[01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:21.380]
Get outta here, when that white...

[01:40:21.380 --> 01:40:22.520]
How would you say that?

[01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:24.640]
You don't have like a little faggot in that movie?

[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:25.680]
Doesn't?

[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:26.560]
Get outta here

[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:28.180]
When I chicken in his mouth it looked awfully gay

[01:40:28.180 --> 01:40:29.420]
That's the wrong movie

[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:32.360]
Jesus Christ

[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:33.960]
He's getting out of my head there

[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:36.600]
Yeah, well you, you that movie did job, you know what I'm saying?

[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:37.240]
Oh yeah

[01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:39.040]
Yeah, he'll just leave the planet

[01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:41.260]
He'll just go into orbit

[01:40:42.260 --> 01:40:43.380]
He's not ready for that one

[01:40:43.380 --> 01:40:48.500]
No, no, seriously, he just, he's, when the story of what you tell me is brother beat him up because he was a little faggot?

[01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:49.380]
Exactly

[01:40:49.380 --> 01:40:52.600]
No, his brother was a little brother, and it was under a lot of pressure

[01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:54.400]
And daddy was a crazy person

[01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:56.920]
And he had a wind him swimming medals in the Audi Audi Audi

[01:40:56.920 --> 01:41:01.800]
And his brother obviously had some issues and everybody in the band was on every kind of drug they could find

[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:06.340]
The brother was a little wimp and, and I think the brother knew they, at least they implied

[01:41:06.340 --> 01:41:10.640]
That the brother knew that he was the child of another father

[01:41:11.420 --> 01:41:13.020]
Yeah, no they didn't imply that

[01:41:13.020 --> 01:41:14.860]
Of course he knew it, they all know it as they told it

[01:41:14.860 --> 01:41:17.120]
And he's the redhead, it's the child that, it's something he didn't have red hair

[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:18.480]
Well, thank God for that

[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:21.060]
I wouldn't know, I never would have wanted to watch it the first time

[01:41:23.220 --> 01:41:25.520]

[01:41:35.300 --> 01:41:38.000]
Hey Neil, I was one for the part, the couple for the tall

[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:39.360]
Which pull is that?

[01:41:39.740 --> 01:41:40.660]
The one for the movie

[01:41:40.660 --> 01:41:41.480]
Okay

[01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:45.420]
Yeah, the funny one is Harold and Kumar is eventually a white castle

[01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:46.880]
What?

[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:51.080]
Harold and Kumar is eventually a white castle

[01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:51.920]
Yeah

[01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:55.420]
And one, even though he doesn't admit he's gay

[01:41:55.420 --> 01:41:59.220]
And I don't know if you like him, but in my nori report was

[01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:03.060]
What's the value you think is gay and we all think he's gay?

[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:04.000]
Tom Cruise

[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.660]
Oh, that Tom Cruise, you're failing, oh

[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:08.960]
Okay, pal

[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:12.480]
If he comes in at a time, we'll get a lot more people to actually like the guy

[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:13.920]
Okay, thanks pal

[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:16.720]
When I was he trying to say that Tom Cruise is gay?

[01:42:17.260 --> 01:42:17.620]
You're gay

[01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:18.320]
Oh, no

[01:42:19.460 --> 01:42:22.700]
He's in the closet with a lot of company John Provolta's in there too

[01:42:22.700 --> 01:42:23.280]
Right?

[01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:25.360]
Not to mention our car

[01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:26.320]
What is going on?

[01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:27.360]
I'm pretty calm in the closet

[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:28.020]
Yeah

[01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:31.640]
Oh, man

[01:42:32.380 --> 01:42:33.340]
That was great

[01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:35.200]
Anybody missed out this out park episode?

[01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:36.460]
I'm so glad you sent that to me

[01:42:36.460 --> 01:42:37.820]
I'm really glad to hear that

[01:42:37.820 --> 01:42:40.000]
The explanation of Scientology, which a lot of people don't know

[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:40.620]
Right

[01:42:40.620 --> 01:42:41.600]
Yeah, that was that

[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:43.180]
And if they kept putting on the screen

[01:42:43.180 --> 01:42:45.160]
And this is what scientists tell us

[01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:46.620]
I don't believe it actually I believe it

[01:42:46.620 --> 01:42:49.600]
Because who the hell would believe it, unless you're like, you don't like that

[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:50.220]
Exactly

[01:42:50.220 --> 01:42:51.500]
It was a spaceship

[01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:52.260]
Oh, I'm sorry

[01:42:53.340 --> 01:42:54.720]
Yeah, he's out of this world, alright?

[01:42:54.780 --> 01:42:57.500]
That Tom Cruise is just cruise out out Tom, you're not fooling nobody

[01:42:57.500 --> 01:42:58.240]
You're fair, man

[01:42:58.240 --> 01:42:59.380]
Got it

[01:42:59.380 --> 01:43:00.800]
Somebody QAM, hello

[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:01.880]
Hello, Nia

[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:02.620]
Yes, sir

[01:43:02.620 --> 01:43:04.240]
I got one for your movie, Paul

[01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:04.900]
Okay

[01:43:05.380 --> 01:43:06.920]
Let's try reservoir dog

[01:43:07.820 --> 01:43:09.320]
Turns keep telling me don't see that

[01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:13.060]
I don't think you'd like it, but why don't you watch it and let me know if I'm right

[01:43:13.580 --> 01:43:13.940]
Okay

[01:43:14.580 --> 01:43:16.360]
Are you the better, Ishmael, one of the two

[01:43:16.900 --> 01:43:17.720]
Okay, thanks, pal

[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:19.620]
Ishmael, never saw Ishmael

[01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:22.560]
Reservoir, dogs

[01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:25.660]
Is that like Cobb's Hill and Rochester's at a reservoir?

[01:43:26.760 --> 01:43:28.260]
5'6'7'05'60

[01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:31.040]
The lilac fainted out yet, but the sun is shining

[01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:33.940]
We had a little bit of snow overnight and it's already gone, is your Toronto weather report?

[01:43:34.660 --> 01:43:38.080]
No snow, had some snow overnight, a little bit maybe a half an inch on gone

[01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:39.280]
Aren't you excited?

[01:43:39.660 --> 01:43:39.780]
No

[01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:41.040]
Aren't you happy for me?

[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:43.040]
No snow, it's already the February the 7th

[01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:46.720]
There's no such thing as global warming, although it is like in the 20s

[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:48.860]
Which little not too on the Toasty side, you got rid of that

[01:43:48.860 --> 01:43:50.020]
Yeah, that's cool, that's nice

[01:43:50.020 --> 01:43:51.100]
Was it really nice?

[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:51.960]
Yeah, I hope it went to the top

[01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:52.340]
Or baby

[01:43:53.820 --> 01:43:54.780]
Somebody QAM, hello

[01:43:55.860 --> 01:43:57.980]
Yeah, I got one for the worst murder list

[01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:01.000]
It's the worst murder, okay?

[01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:04.440]
It's all relative, how about Harry Truman?

[01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:08.660]
He killed a lot of people's men with an abamba, two bombas

[01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:11.680]
Okay, Nagasaki and Hiroshima, baby, Harry Truman

[01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:16.720]
But it says the most despicable murder, and I guess if you took the bullet in Japan, they'd probably say good old Harry

[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:18.000]
Wouldn't they?

[01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:19.560]
A record, Harry Truman

[01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:20.800]
Probably didn't count into that

[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:21.500]
No

[01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:27.120]
In fact, maybe that woman from France, maybe she actually didn't have the operation, maybe she just...

[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:28.120]
Oh, I can't believe it

[01:44:28.860 --> 01:44:28.860]

[01:44:29.140 --> 01:44:30.840]
I don't want to see her, I mean rule, man

[01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:31.820]
I don't want to see her

[01:44:31.820 --> 01:44:33.320]
I mean rule, I'm not, oh I see

[01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:34.340]
Never the last

[01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:38.620]
I see, I realized that it was miraculous that they gave her a face, and that was like...

[01:44:38.620 --> 01:44:43.420]
You know, speaking in French, but I got a little French, I just...

[01:44:43.420 --> 01:44:44.800]
I can't handle a French, I'm sorry

[01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:48.980]
You know something, that's not a bad idea, faceless French

[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:54.240]
We can be improving in Montreal, it's like that, big improvement Harry

[01:44:54.820 --> 01:45:00.900]
I'll get you outside of Quebec that most of the Canadians would be very happy, they would be very happy for that right away, faceless frogs

[01:45:00.900 --> 01:45:04.600]
Oh, speaking of that, don't forget Jacques Martel, be honest with Curtis to the three

[01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:08.020]
Mark that down in New County, you don't want to be listening then

[01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:11.860]
I'm sure you won't be, does that mean QAM, hello?

[01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:12.680]
Hey Neil

[01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:13.480]
Yes sir

[01:45:14.420 --> 01:45:17.200]
You know, Godfather's the obvious one, but I found my first one

[01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:19.820]
That's why I said the other than the Godfather, that's where I said beside

[01:45:19.820 --> 01:45:24.380]
Right, Fargo, every time Fargo doesn't matter what part of that movie is

[01:45:25.540 --> 01:45:27.480]
I can't believe it, I agree

[01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:31.100]
I want to say one other thing, I think you're right

[01:45:31.100 --> 01:45:32.320]
Can I just say one thing?

[01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:33.960]
Oh yes sir

[01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:36.820]
Oh, he's a little guy, I can't even look at him

[01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:43.280]
And QAM blew it by not putting Bob and Tom on instead of messing with Howard, that would have been perfect

[01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:46.680]
Yeah, that's right, I kept telling him that, and whatever I tell him they do the opposite

[01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:50.340]
If they put him on, Mad Dog will still be on after me and Hank would be in the afternoon

[01:45:50.340 --> 01:45:51.960]
And everything would be great, we'd be kicking ass

[01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:55.620]
But they still haven't got a morning show now because they don't know where they won't listen to anybody

[01:45:56.140 --> 01:45:58.820]
And you want to know why they don't want to put them on because they don't do sports

[01:45:58.820 --> 01:46:02.240]
You know, Howard doesn't do sports either, but they put him on and practically lost the license

[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:03.900]
Bob and Tom would loosen their license

[01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:08.440]
And Bob and Tom still do sports, kind of the national level now and then

[01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:13.960]
And it's a shame because I get Bob and Tom like north of commercial on a good day

[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:14.540]
Right

[01:46:14.540 --> 01:46:19.520]
But it's like it's missing me, I mean, they'd be a great market down there, you know

[01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:21.840]
Anyway, have a great day, Bob

[01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:24.160]
Makes too much sense for us, Pally, have a great life

[01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:28.120]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, the pound 5, 6, the Verizon, Singular Wireless Line

[01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:33.200]
We pull up the old Ying Yang, which of today's pop singers or groups is the worst

[01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:35.520]
I'm putting that one, we're not going to much response on that

[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:38.260]
And you want to know why? What is our audience know about today's pop singers?

[01:46:39.260 --> 01:46:39.560]
Right?

[01:46:40.940 --> 01:46:42.800]
Right, what goes this pop today, right?

[01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:48.220]
That's what I'm talking about about, you know, Buster Rhymes and Buster Move and Buster's

[01:46:48.220 --> 01:46:50.000]
Bling Man and all this other crap

[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:50.440]
Buster

[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:54.540]
The East Coast rappers and the West Coast rappers and the Candy rappers and all this other garbage

[01:46:54.540 --> 01:46:56.240]
Let's play that Candy Rapper song

[01:46:56.800 --> 01:46:57.560]
Alright, I'll cute right up

[01:46:57.560 --> 01:47:01.640]
Okay, but the one about the movies, and again I could watch the imaginary here

[01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:03.100]
Is every day and you're going to say, well that's because

[01:47:03.100 --> 01:47:07.700]
No, that's, I just like the whole story, I just think it's very emotional

[01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:08.780]
You know?

[01:47:09.060 --> 01:47:09.160]
Yeah

[01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:09.980]
No, it's a good movie

[01:47:09.980 --> 01:47:11.100]
It's a great movie

[01:47:11.980 --> 01:47:13.980]
And the acting in there, I'm telling you she is

[01:47:13.980 --> 01:47:17.660]
Because I'm trying to think of another movie I saw Stagorny Weaver and B.S.I.E. Aliens

[01:47:17.660 --> 01:47:19.040]
Did you see Aliens?

[01:47:19.540 --> 01:47:20.260]
Yes, of course

[01:47:20.260 --> 01:47:22.780]
In fact, I saw it in the theater when it first came out

[01:47:22.780 --> 01:47:27.720]
I thought it was very, very tense, death and the maiden

[01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:30.800]
Yeah, where she just did a phenomenal job all the way through

[01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:35.640]
And she sure as well did a phenomenal job in this movie, she was just, she was great

[01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:39.500]
And in the honest, there's something interesting in that last scene

[01:47:39.500 --> 01:47:42.600]
I know you're going to say he's reading all this facts up in it again

[01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:45.960]
As they're walking home from the graduation ceremony where he just played

[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:47.020]
He'd think of on the piano

[01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:50.760]
And his next door neighbor, his buddy, I put his hand on the shoulder and said

[01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:52.420]
Oh, let's go, I need something

[01:47:52.780 --> 01:47:55.700]
And they're going off to lunch and you'll notice in the back of the group

[01:47:55.700 --> 01:47:58.740]
There is Vern and the sister, okay?

[01:47:59.900 --> 01:48:00.260]
Right?

[01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:04.940]
Remember Vern left some of the sister, Vern, they were like, poor desperate Vern, they wanted to kill himself

[01:48:04.940 --> 01:48:05.380]
Right

[01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:11.520]
And then you see the next door neighbors that she had the big ral with

[01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:17.840]
And then there's Emil Hirsch and the guy and then there's Mommy and Daddy

[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:18.560]
See what I'm saying?

[01:48:18.620 --> 01:48:18.760]
Right

[01:48:19.180 --> 01:48:19.540]
Yeah

[01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:23.440]
Everybody said there was a led's girlfriend, I don't love you when he ran out of there

[01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:26.180]
I don't think it was just the bruises that...

[01:48:26.180 --> 01:48:27.180]
No, no, no, no

[01:48:27.180 --> 01:48:28.840]
I think there was more to it than that, I agree

[01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:30.320]
1213

[01:48:32.500 --> 01:48:35.420]
In fact, maybe he thought that she had like an ugly bruise

[01:48:35.420 --> 01:48:37.160]
Well, she's not but he is

[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:37.580]
I see

[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:42.340]
When it comes to mattresses, there are a lot of gimmicks, the latest are sleep numbers

[01:48:42.340 --> 01:48:44.040]
Otherwise known as air mattresses

[01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:47.700]
They're only a warrantied and full for two years, they squeak, they pop

[01:48:47.700 --> 01:48:50.280]
They can lose their setting during the night and they cost a fortune

[01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:53.840]
If you want a high quality brand name mattress that lasts for years and years in color

[01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:56.200]
We've got friends that dial a mattress and one 800 mattress

[01:48:56.680 --> 01:49:01.280]
When you call that number, you'll get no run-arounds, no showroom, shenanigans, just factory-direct prices

[01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:03.180]
On the best brands you know trust and love

[01:49:03.180 --> 01:49:07.900]
When you call one 800 mattress, you'll choose and pull it as biggest inventory of the biggest name

[01:49:07.900 --> 01:49:11.600]
See these, sir, the Simmons, King Coil, Temporate, Exturge and Foster, hew it

[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:16.140]
Already for same data-liberate prices that are lower, much lower than the so-called big name chores

[01:49:16.140 --> 01:49:17.940]
stores even during their big sales

[01:49:17.940 --> 01:49:21.380]
Call one 800 mattress, you can have the bed you want to live at the date and time you want it

[01:49:21.380 --> 01:49:25.300]

1-800-MATTRES, leave off that last S because of course it stands for Savings

[01:49:39.500 --> 01:49:41.960]
This is Neel Roger

[01:49:43.060 --> 01:49:46.380]
This is 5-16-Q-A-S

[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:50.820]
The little currently worse than Neel Roger

[01:49:50.820 --> 01:49:52.200]
Are you ready to order, sir?

[01:49:52.340 --> 01:49:53.300]
Yes, I'll have the...

[01:49:53.500 --> 01:49:55.340]
Q-Q-Q

[01:49:55.340 --> 01:50:00.980]
This man suffers from a rare form of Tourette syndrome called G-rated Tourette

[01:50:00.980 --> 01:50:05.000]
That comes with a vegetable, all try the...

[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.220]
Car-the-car-the-car-the-characteritum

[01:50:07.220 --> 01:50:12.300]
Symptoms of G-rated Tourette syndrome include uncontrollable outbursts of euphemisms

[01:50:12.300 --> 01:50:14.020]
And for an appetizer?

[01:50:14.660 --> 01:50:18.080]
Shucks, Shucks, Shucks, Shrimp puppet

[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:22.220]
Unfortunately, there is no cure for G-rated Tourette's

[01:50:22.220 --> 01:50:24.280]
Would you care for Sally?

[01:50:24.420 --> 01:50:26.600]
Yes, the Pek, Pek, Pek, Pek

[01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:27.080]
Well, Sally.

[01:50:27.180 --> 01:50:27.960]
Oh, wait, you know what?

[01:50:28.180 --> 01:50:31.960]
Make that a valley, valley, valley, valley, floating, floating, standing on the floor

[01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:35.840]
Ok, that's one yet dark, that's the red, that's the red...

[01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:36.820]
Great drought

[01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:41.780]
The good news is G-rated Tourette's isn't as offensive as other forms of Tourette's

[01:50:41.780 --> 01:50:44.220]
The bad news is it's a lot more annoying

[01:50:44.220 --> 01:50:45.600]
And for dessert...

[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:46.800]
Oh, I'll have the...

[01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:48.180]
Fudge, fudge, fudge

[01:50:49.900 --> 01:50:52.080]
I'm 18 at 560, I'll bet he will.

[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:54.020]
And anyway, here's the fact that I've only

[01:50:54.020 --> 01:50:56.760]
his other page coming, but he never said it.

[01:50:57.340 --> 01:50:58.860]
Though, wait a minute, I think it's coming right now.

[01:50:59.000 --> 01:50:59.820]
Is that the other page of this?

[01:51:00.140 --> 01:51:01.180]
You're getting something that ain't for me.

[01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:03.320]
Here are the onlistables in order for Morse

[01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:03.800]
to not to work.

[01:51:03.980 --> 01:51:05.320]
I'm getting something that's not from you.

[01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:07.120]
Come on.

[01:51:07.660 --> 01:51:09.020]
Maybe it's one of them ads, one of them,

[01:51:09.020 --> 01:51:10.400]
a fax machine, machine ads.

[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:12.920]
Let's see what it is.

[01:51:13.580 --> 01:51:14.160]
Oh, it's from you.

[01:51:14.260 --> 01:51:16.860]
It's just for the movie pool and a great escape

[01:51:16.860 --> 01:51:17.500]
in the natural.

[01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:18.900]
You didn't tell me that?

[01:51:19.140 --> 01:51:19.300]
Yeah.

[01:51:20.020 --> 01:51:21.380]
Well, what does that mean?

[01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:22.640]
Where are you getting a second page from?

[01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:23.940]
No, no, from the other one.

[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:24.800]
I'm going to fill line up.

[01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:25.660]
I'm going to propose line up.

[01:51:25.940 --> 01:51:26.320]
Oh, I see.

[01:51:26.360 --> 01:51:28.300]
And at the end of it, it says, here are the onlistables

[01:51:28.300 --> 01:51:29.680]
in order for Morse to not to work.

[01:51:29.780 --> 01:51:30.280]
And that's all you got.

[01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:30.740]
Oh, yeah, that's it.

[01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:31.300]
That's all you got.

[01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:35.080]
Well, he got so whipped up by into a frenzy

[01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:36.220]
that he forgot a second page.

[01:51:36.500 --> 01:51:38.940]
And of course, it says from PES, I think you left the T off

[01:51:38.940 --> 01:51:39.360]
at the end.

[01:51:40.100 --> 01:51:42.800]
The natural, oh, that's not that awful of baseball movie,

[01:51:42.860 --> 01:51:43.100]
is it?

[01:51:43.180 --> 01:51:43.980]
With Robert Redford, yeah.

[01:51:43.980 --> 01:51:46.520]
Oh, well, why you didn't watch that, did you?

[01:51:46.700 --> 01:51:47.100]
I did.

[01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:48.080]
Oh.

[01:51:48.380 --> 01:51:48.900]
And it was good.

[01:51:49.320 --> 01:51:50.100]
And it was OK.

[01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:52.140]
First sports movie.

[01:51:52.280 --> 01:51:54.900]
That's a movie that you would like to play over and over and over again.

[01:51:55.080 --> 01:51:56.020]
I was, no, I would not.

[01:51:56.440 --> 01:51:57.160]
Oh, my God.

[01:51:57.320 --> 01:52:00.060]
I said it was a first sports movie.

[01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:00.780]
It's really bad.

[01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:01.500]
Right.

[01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:03.800]
Now, what about was the one who's the kid that was in the great

[01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:06.660]
Santini with Robert DuVon, and Blood Danner?

[01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:07.480]
You know, he played the son.

[01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:10.160]
You know what I'm talking about?

[01:52:10.200 --> 01:52:11.220]
Yeah, but I'll never take it.

[01:52:11.300 --> 01:52:12.400]
And he played a pitcher in Atlanta.

[01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:15.960]
Brayden's pitcher in some sports movie, and he was married to this hot chick.

[01:52:16.300 --> 01:52:18.180]
And they got divorced, and they did this.

[01:52:18.440 --> 01:52:18.840]
And remember that?

[01:52:19.260 --> 01:52:20.680]
I bet you just saw that movie.

[01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:22.600]
Not by that description.

[01:52:22.780 --> 01:52:23.600]
Can't, doesn't ring a bell.

[01:52:23.700 --> 01:52:24.760]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[01:52:24.780 --> 01:52:25.340]
You see that?

[01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:30.140]
So that most sports movies are crap other than Brian's song.

[01:52:30.680 --> 01:52:31.560]
Now, that wasn't really a movie.

[01:52:31.900 --> 01:52:33.440]
Now, originally, that was a TV movie, right?

[01:52:34.460 --> 01:52:34.880]
That's right.

[01:52:35.540 --> 01:52:38.180]
Brian's song with James Conn.

[01:52:38.540 --> 01:52:40.920]
So let me put up a great 10th, he needs to figure out who that kid is.

[01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:41.400]
Look at it up.

[01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:43.500]
His name is Michael O'Keefe.

[01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:44.820]
Michael O'Keefe, that's Elaine.

[01:52:45.380 --> 01:52:45.380]

[01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:47.400]
Well, look at that and do Michael O'Keefe.

[01:52:47.540 --> 01:52:49.440]
Well, don't think you'll get, I mean, why?

[01:52:49.820 --> 01:52:50.440]
I'm triangulating.

[01:52:50.840 --> 01:52:52.780]
Well, now that wasn't what we would think of the tumor.

[01:52:53.340 --> 01:52:54.620]
Tumor is in trouble.

[01:52:54.940 --> 01:52:55.240]
Remember that?

[01:52:55.460 --> 01:52:55.660]
No.

[01:52:56.240 --> 01:52:58.920]
Yeah, you do the black kid with a, you know, that molasses.

[01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:00.580]
He had the molasses on it, wagon.

[01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:02.860]
And again, those red necks were beaten up.

[01:53:03.100 --> 01:53:04.540]
I bet it's you make me sick.

[01:53:04.660 --> 01:53:05.640]
Don't you remember that red necks?

[01:53:05.940 --> 01:53:06.140]
OK.

[01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:08.760]
You remember that from the great Santini?

[01:53:09.100 --> 01:53:09.660]
Yeah, I remember it.

[01:53:09.740 --> 01:53:09.980]
I'm sorry.

[01:53:10.100 --> 01:53:10.540]
I remember it.

[01:53:10.540 --> 01:53:11.300]
He's the same time here.

[01:53:11.380 --> 01:53:14.160]
His buddy's name was Tumor.

[01:53:14.200 --> 01:53:15.140]
Hey, he was in Cady Shack.

[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:16.640]
Cady Shack?

[01:53:16.780 --> 01:53:16.940]
Yeah.

[01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:17.920]
Michael O'Keefe.

[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:18.760]
He's a pretty good actor.

[01:53:20.040 --> 01:53:21.480]
Well, that's not the movie I'm talking about.

[01:53:21.640 --> 01:53:23.260]
What's the middle of going through the list of it here?

[01:53:23.340 --> 01:53:25.220]
Well, he should have harvested his own gray lady down.

[01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:27.100]
Cady Shack is a sluggish wife.

[01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:27.740]
There it is.

[01:53:28.420 --> 01:53:30.040]
That's what it was called, the sluggish wife.

[01:53:30.460 --> 01:53:31.340]
It's a baseball movie.

[01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:32.840]
It's a Neil Findham's.

[01:53:32.920 --> 01:53:33.640]
I've never heard of it.

[01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:34.380]
I'll be there.

[01:53:34.520 --> 01:53:35.340]
Well, you don't want to see it.

[01:53:35.340 --> 01:53:35.720]
Believe me.

[01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:37.280]
Trust me.

[01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:39.520]
There's too many bad sports movies.

[01:53:39.520 --> 01:53:42.180]
They name me a really good sports movie, other than Brian's song.

[01:53:43.300 --> 01:53:44.820]
Which really wasn't that good of a movie.

[01:53:44.980 --> 01:53:45.940]
It was a tear-jerker book.

[01:53:46.240 --> 01:53:47.580]
What was a great sports movie?

[01:53:47.800 --> 01:53:48.180]
I do it.

[01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:48.360]

[01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:48.520]
I do it.

[01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:48.620]
I do it.

[01:53:48.620 --> 01:53:48.800]
I do it.

[01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:48.800]

[01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:48.800]

[01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:49.340]
I do it.

[01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:49.340]

[01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:49.400]
I do it.

[01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:49.400]

[01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:49.400]

[01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:49.400]

[01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:49.400]

[01:53:49.460 --> 01:53:49.460]

[01:53:49.460 --> 01:53:49.460]

[01:53:49.460 --> 01:53:49.460]

[01:53:49.920 --> 01:53:50.600]
I do it.

[01:53:50.780 --> 01:53:51.460]
I do it.

[01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:53.420]
I do it.

[01:53:53.900 --> 01:54:08.680]
I do it.

[01:54:09.620 --> 01:54:10.940]
That was a Rocky Maristory?

[01:54:11.240 --> 01:54:11.420]
Yeah.

[01:54:12.020 --> 01:54:13.000]
Mostly I just guessed.

[01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:15.860]
What about Rocky?

[01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:17.180]
Rocky.

[01:54:17.400 --> 01:54:18.120]
I like the Rockies.

[01:54:18.700 --> 01:54:19.060]
Oh!

[01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:20.960]
Well, I've never been out there.

[01:54:21.860 --> 01:54:22.160]
They're nice.

[01:54:23.760 --> 01:54:24.940]
Do you like the Rockies?

[01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:27.300]
That's because you like Burgess Meredith, because he was in Batman.

[01:54:28.240 --> 01:54:28.900]
That's a very good idea.

[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:32.180]
Okay, the greatest kpop in actually like Burgess Meredith on the show.

[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:33.640]
And he's dead, but that's too bad.

[01:54:34.340 --> 01:54:35.920]
So anyway, I want to read this other thing.

[01:54:36.020 --> 01:54:36.600]
I'll get to it.

[01:54:36.980 --> 01:54:37.680]
About the lineup.

[01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:39.040]
WQAM, hello.

[01:54:39.580 --> 01:54:39.900]
Okay.

[01:54:40.700 --> 01:54:41.340]
WQAM, hola.

[01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:44.000]
Hello?

[01:54:45.140 --> 01:54:46.400]
Sound like he was in the middle of lunch.

[01:54:46.580 --> 01:54:47.560]
You know food yet for you guys?

[01:54:48.060 --> 01:54:49.900]
No, they were skipping lunch today.

[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:53.520]
Well, after John and Baker yesterday and 4,000 pounds of food, you probably have like a

[01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:54.880]
a need.

[01:54:55.220 --> 01:54:56.020]
Yeah, I'm going to sit and poop it.

[01:54:56.940 --> 01:54:57.540]
WQAM, hello.

[01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:01.760]
WQAM, hello.

[01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:01.920]
WQAM, hello.

[01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:02.920]
Hello, Neil.

[01:55:03.460 --> 01:55:03.720]
Yes, sir.

[01:55:04.060 --> 01:55:06.920]
Uh, food, I'd like to watch it all the time around here.

[01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:07.140]
Sure.

[01:55:08.340 --> 01:55:08.700]
Rounders?

[01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:09.980]
Yeah, the poker movies.

[01:55:10.140 --> 01:55:10.840]
That's the bad thing.

[01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:13.480]
Sounds like that period of promo song, okay?

[01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:15.520]
That day in the midward, no, I didn't know.

[01:55:15.620 --> 01:55:18.280]
Holiday time, I always have to see Christmas vacation.

[01:55:19.160 --> 01:55:20.080]
Okay, thanks, Malik.

[01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:20.580]
All right.

[01:55:20.860 --> 01:55:22.660]
Oh, rounders, round and time to win.

[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:25.140]
Rounder, wee, round it goes round and...

[01:55:25.740 --> 01:55:27.160]
I could have sang that song just that.

[01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:27.600]
Yeah, you should have.

[01:55:27.980 --> 01:55:28.120]
Yeah.

[01:55:28.820 --> 01:55:30.520]
But then again, I wasn't some, um, Barbara.

[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:33.340]
Some Guinea Barbara from Orbit Hillies from.

[01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:34.020]
Where was he from?

[01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:36.500]
He's dead by the way, and Bud Davey still pissed off about it.

[01:55:37.960 --> 01:55:39.880]
Fies, maybe Bud Davey's dead too.

[01:55:40.260 --> 01:55:41.080]
I'm trying to think.

[01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:42.760]
Didn't we have a thing where Bud dead baby's died?

[01:55:43.660 --> 01:55:45.360]
Yeah, they called the pretenders not true, I think.

[01:55:46.500 --> 01:55:47.340]
I don't know.

[01:55:47.500 --> 01:55:47.580]
I don't know, man.

[01:55:47.900 --> 01:55:48.000]
Whatever.

[01:55:48.340 --> 01:55:48.660]
I don't remember.

[01:55:49.060 --> 01:55:53.740]
The fact is FYI, Joe Rose has been really bashing 790's management.

[01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:58.060]
And anyone can, uh, he can't last few days.

[01:55:58.200 --> 01:55:59.260]
He wants to out over there as well.

[01:55:59.320 --> 01:56:00.840]
I'm hearing he hates them like poison.

[01:56:01.020 --> 01:56:02.940]
He's embarrassing, humiliated to be on over there.

[01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:05.260]
I think he would love to get fired.

[01:56:05.260 --> 01:56:08.480]
So QM could woo him back now that there's a new program, dude.

[01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:10.880]
There, no, it's not a new pro.

[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:11.640]
We got a new GM.

[01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:12.880]
Forget about the program, dude.

[01:56:12.920 --> 01:56:13.440]
He's close.

[01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:15.640]
He called me yesterday and said, but don't remember like that.

[01:56:15.820 --> 01:56:16.780]
Just leave me alone, Claire.

[01:56:16.900 --> 01:56:17.180]
It's okay.

[01:56:17.540 --> 01:56:18.680]
Don't bother me, no more.

[01:56:19.300 --> 01:56:20.480]
Don't bother me, no more.

[01:56:21.060 --> 01:56:22.860]
Oh, and he did thank me after I embarrassed him.

[01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:25.260]
It would thank me for, uh, beating the station out of that pool

[01:56:25.260 --> 01:56:28.040]
and making this look like, uh, fantastic and making them look stupid

[01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:28.700]
across the street.

[01:56:29.500 --> 01:56:30.800]
Very sincere, by the way.

[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:31.220]
Oh, no.

[01:56:31.220 --> 01:56:32.000]
I don't know what I was talking about.

[01:56:32.540 --> 01:56:32.800]
What?

[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:38.040]
That being said, here would be a perfect lineup for QM says PEST.

[01:56:39.180 --> 01:56:40.140]
Five to seven a.m.

[01:56:40.300 --> 01:56:42.660]
The big O is tolerable at that time slot.

[01:56:42.820 --> 01:56:44.300]
In other words, this guy gets up around seven, 10.

[01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:45.880]
Seven to 10 a.m.

[01:56:45.980 --> 01:56:46.660]
Jero's available.

[01:56:46.660 --> 01:56:47.720]
If not, keep the fat guy.

[01:56:48.340 --> 01:56:50.000]
This is a switch to hang during Joe's commercials.

[01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:51.340]
Oh, well, thank you so much.

[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:52.240]
Ten to two.

[01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:53.720]
The gorilla, of course, with the sidekicks.

[01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:56.140]
George, the other guy who works with you is two vanilla for me.

[01:56:58.720 --> 01:56:59.720]
Would that mean Josh?

[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:00.560]
Yeah.

[01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:02.820]
I'll work on, uh, what a coming chocolate.

[01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:04.220]
Yeah, he had the chocolate ass.

[01:57:04.500 --> 01:57:06.080]
I just haven't seen that side of it.

[01:57:10.940 --> 01:57:13.200]
George, at least, stimulates the mind as clever at times.

[01:57:13.300 --> 01:57:15.180]
Well, not at this particular time.

[01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:17.640]
George, it's weird, but before all the senses could be,

[01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:20.200]
as I could listen to your whole show, but when you were fourth by going

[01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:22.100]
to stop on a change, I think you got a lot better.

[01:57:22.340 --> 01:57:24.260]
It would be a step or a leg on filth for entertainment.

[01:57:24.420 --> 01:57:25.680]
I think that really was a positive.

[01:57:25.820 --> 01:57:26.580]
I still let it fill.

[01:57:27.060 --> 01:57:30.320]
Two to four has to be courteous because Bow is too blind at this time.

[01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:31.680]
I think he left off at any time.

[01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:34.120]
Four to seven p.m. no brainer, mad perro.

[01:57:34.700 --> 01:57:35.760]
Is that how you see dog?

[01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:36.620]
Perro.

[01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:37.560]
Very good.

[01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:38.320]
Yeah, perro.

[01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:38.920]
Perro.

[01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:39.400]
That's right.

[01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:40.120]
Perro.

[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:40.740]
You got to roll it.

[01:57:41.480 --> 01:57:42.380]
You don't roll it.

[01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:43.040]
You're saying butt.

[01:57:43.880 --> 01:57:44.760]
Well, the mad butt.

[01:57:45.420 --> 01:57:47.980]
Seven p.m. to let ever put Bow or anybody because I don't listen past it.

[01:57:48.120 --> 01:57:51.040]
And of course, uh, uh, and then says here, the unlisted bulls in order from

[01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:52.400]
worse is not worse than he never said it.

[01:57:52.700 --> 01:57:53.640]
You said he get to me now?

[01:57:54.100 --> 01:57:54.220]
No.

[01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:59.080]
Oh, Riley, I'm sorry.

[01:57:59.740 --> 01:58:00.580]
Now, that's it.

[01:58:00.700 --> 01:58:01.200]
You're not right.

[01:58:02.100 --> 01:58:04.720]
You're, you know, mean well, but you know, he wants to do the whole show.

[01:58:04.820 --> 01:58:05.880]
He just wants to take the show over.

[01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:10.440]
And again, the question is, other than Godfather, a movie you could watch is at

[01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:10.800]
the end time.

[01:58:11.140 --> 01:58:12.180]
Not a list of movies.

[01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:16.280]
Not the 50,000 movies that since you have no life, you're going to sit and watch them all over

[01:58:16.280 --> 01:58:16.600]
over again.

[01:58:16.860 --> 01:58:18.320]
All I did was imaginary heroes.

[01:58:18.420 --> 01:58:20.340]
That's the only one I put on there because I'm smitten with it.

[01:58:21.200 --> 01:58:21.520]
Okay.

[01:58:22.140 --> 01:58:24.640]
And just because you think, Amy will hurt you some little pansy.

[01:58:25.580 --> 01:58:26.860]
You don't look like a pansy.

[01:58:26.860 --> 01:58:28.280]
I don't know.

[01:58:29.260 --> 01:58:30.140]
Kind of.

[01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:30.480]
Yeah.

[01:58:30.600 --> 01:58:35.260]
Well, you really think he looks like a pansy, Amy will hurt you.

[01:58:35.260 --> 01:58:36.080]
Are you kidding me?

[01:58:36.680 --> 01:58:39.460]
If he wouldn't have been in those two movies, I know you know those rules.

[01:58:39.680 --> 01:58:43.820]
Hurty boys, but sometimes I wouldn't say he's a pretty boy.

[01:58:43.820 --> 01:58:44.520]
That's the point.

[01:58:44.640 --> 01:58:45.780]
He's a poofed up.

[01:58:45.880 --> 01:58:46.500]
Man, he's a.

[01:58:48.460 --> 01:58:53.620]
He's a scrunchie.

[01:58:53.620 --> 01:58:54.440]
I see.

[01:58:57.680 --> 01:58:58.540]
Oh, no.

[01:58:59.060 --> 01:59:01.220]
What kind of body wash is he using these days?

[01:59:01.740 --> 01:59:02.180]
Lylac.

[01:59:03.340 --> 01:59:03.780]
Lylac?

[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:04.280]
Yeah.

[01:59:04.740 --> 01:59:05.520]
For the squeezed.

[01:59:06.540 --> 01:59:07.360]
But not with his hands.

[01:59:07.920 --> 01:59:08.460]
20 cents.

[01:59:11.120 --> 01:59:12.200]
Maybe his neighbor.

[01:59:13.140 --> 01:59:14.740]
27 after 1 a.m.

[01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:17.320]
Okay, the ice Valentine's Day is next to the day.

I thought of always be with you.

[02:01:14.520 --> 02:01:16.900]
To stay away from the simple things that you do.

[02:01:16.900 --> 02:01:16.900]

[02:01:16.900 --> 02:01:16.900]

[02:01:16.900 --> 02:01:16.900]

[02:01:16.900 --> 02:01:16.900]

[02:01:17.900 --> 02:01:20.100]
I'm sorry but I shouldn't see no signs.

[02:01:20.460 --> 02:01:23.020]
No sense of a friend of mine.

[02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:25.980]
You got to fake it now I've got to do.

[02:01:26.260 --> 02:01:29.300]
So people wear it from a simple things to wear.

[02:01:30.580 --> 02:01:32.760]
Keep away from that girl.

[02:01:33.540 --> 02:01:35.960]
Hope no one's telling me what to do now.

[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:38.560]
Keep away from you.

[02:01:40.740 --> 02:01:42.780]
She likes to sleep around.

[02:01:58.780 --> 02:02:06.300]
Hold me...

[02:02:06.300 --> 02:02:08.840]
Open your seat!

[02:02:09.060 --> 02:02:09.900]
Okay.

[02:02:09.900 --> 02:02:15.200]
I don't talk to a wissig any hates like poison you know what too bad right right he's

[02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:19.500]
small potatoes he'll be dead someday so here's this facts again it's a follow up I don't

[02:02:19.500 --> 02:02:22.500]
know why am I wasting so much time on this because to be honest with you I look at the

[02:02:22.500 --> 02:02:26.020]
header and it looks suspiciously like our friend Mark but I guess not and then Mark will

[02:02:26.020 --> 02:02:31.800]
probably facts and say it wasn't me only probably because it's from the OPS but I think he

[02:02:31.800 --> 02:02:36.840]
means PST so some guys just learning oh sorry learning this new fangled facts from left

[02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:42.500]
to oh that must not be Mark because he knows his faxes here are the unlistables in order

[02:02:42.500 --> 02:02:49.840]
from worst as to not the worst gildy worst he says like listening to what nails on a chalkboard

[02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:56.780]
I can't imagine why he would say that uh civic hit Rosenberg depot love bastard and the booster

[02:02:57.400 --> 02:03:01.240]
says all these guys suck but gildy's like listen nails on a chalkboard that's creepy

[02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:07.580]

[02:04:22.040 --> 02:04:25.320]

you got tired of the act right why nice Steve Martin same thing like Jim Kerry who was very

[02:04:30.540 --> 02:04:34.920]
funny for about three minutes until he made all the facial expressions he knows how to do and then

[02:04:34.920 --> 02:04:41.380]
that was the end of it good Canadian boy by the way Jim Kerry so I can say for him okay let's see

[02:04:41.380 --> 02:04:46.800]

[02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:06.760]
thought I did and I did see and I don't know if Josh will agree or disagree with this I thought

[02:05:06.760 --> 02:05:13.640]

[02:05:13.640 --> 02:05:19.440]
reservoir dogs well don't be so vanilla about it now right my bad well whatever if you didn't like

[02:05:23.240 --> 02:05:29.380]

[02:17:50.840 --> 02:17:53.920]
corporation for public broadcasting will be cut by fifty three and a half

[02:17:53.920 --> 02:17:57.480]
million next year and fifty million moe in two thousand eight no mo

[02:17:58.420 --> 02:18:01.380]
those cuts don't reflect others made in funding at the education and commerce

[02:18:01.380 --> 02:18:04.160]
departments and the elimination of specific programs for digital tv

[02:18:04.160 --> 02:18:07.840]
conversion and satellite delivery system public broadcasting officials that

[02:18:07.840 --> 02:18:11.120]
made the entire budget caught a cuts run a hundred and fifty seven million

[02:18:11.120 --> 02:18:12.120]
over the two year period

[02:18:12.840 --> 02:18:16.080]
oscar the grouch has been friendled in the sesame street characters and

[02:18:16.080 --> 02:18:19.040]
president bush who is chosen to make huge cuts to children's tv

[02:18:19.040 --> 02:18:21.840]
programs said representative Edward Markey of Massachusetts

[02:18:22.860 --> 02:18:26.000]
in a world of fast and furious tv with ratings driven content

[02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:29.240]
the public broadcasting system represents the last stronghold of quality

[02:18:29.240 --> 02:18:32.740]
child-oriented programming we owe this to america's children he said

[02:18:33.300 --> 02:18:36.340]
the constant public broadcasting are part of an attempt by the white house to

[02:18:36.340 --> 02:18:39.540]
reduce the country's red ink oh yeah as the administration seeks more money

[02:18:39.540 --> 02:18:42.200]
for the military and seeks to make bush's first-term tax cuts

[02:18:42.200 --> 02:18:46.460]
permit for the rich i mean you stop and think about this you want to swoon

[02:18:47.120 --> 02:18:50.560]
can't afford the you know the rich to be paying more taxes no more but we

[02:18:50.560 --> 02:18:53.380]
got a cut money from a pbs because there's a bunch of liberal bastards

[02:18:54.320 --> 02:18:58.120]
attempts by conservative republicans to cut see a corporation for public

[02:18:58.120 --> 02:19:01.480]
broadcasting funds are nothing new many conservatives view the public broadcasting

[02:19:01.480 --> 02:19:05.420]
as a bastion of liberalism while there've been attempts to make cuts the

[02:19:05.420 --> 02:19:08.980]
service has wide support in congress from republicans and democrats who like

[02:19:08.980 --> 02:19:11.780]
its dedication to public affairs and educational programming

[02:19:13.060 --> 02:19:16.100]
last year an overwhelming majority in congress voted to be store cuts

[02:19:16.100 --> 02:19:19.600]
proposed by the administration this year those cuts go even deeper and could

[02:19:19.600 --> 02:19:22.680]
be more difficult to win the fight in congress had john loss in president and

[02:19:22.680 --> 02:19:25.560]
c-e of the association of pv television stations

[02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.920]
we've dealt with cuts in this white house every year but these are the deep

[02:19:28.920 --> 02:19:32.900]
as these ever presented lost and said we see a clear and present danger here

[02:19:33.360 --> 02:19:36.480]
it took an advertising campaign from public tv to mobilize the services

[02:19:36.480 --> 02:19:39.240]
supporters something that might not be as effective the second time around

[02:19:39.240 --> 02:19:42.400]
he said this is a tough environment of washing right now we're competing with

[02:19:42.400 --> 02:19:45.920]
other priorities lost and said if you don't make your case you lose we won

[02:19:45.920 --> 02:19:48.620]
last year but only after we asked the station to go on the internet communities

[02:19:48.620 --> 02:19:51.660]
what was happening it's an effort we won't for a close but if you do that every

[02:19:51.660 --> 02:19:54.700]
year it loses its effectiveness we're going to try to win this one on the ground

[02:19:55.340 --> 02:19:59.400]

[02:29:03.040 --> 02:29:03.680]
Fargo

[02:29:04.620 --> 02:29:05.560]
I got Fargo

[02:29:05.560 --> 02:29:07.140]
All send your imaginary heroes back

[02:29:07.140 --> 02:29:07.960]
I can make a copy

[02:29:07.960 --> 02:29:09.620]
Keep my copy and send you the original

[02:29:09.620 --> 02:29:11.100]
What do you mean send it to me back?

[02:29:11.100 --> 02:29:11.900]
I never send it to you

[02:29:11.900 --> 02:29:13.480]
I had Amazon.com send it to you

[02:29:13.480 --> 02:29:14.040]
Well that's what I mean

[02:29:14.040 --> 02:29:14.720]
Oh

[02:29:15.180 --> 02:29:15.580]
Okay

[02:29:16.340 --> 02:29:17.560]
I'd like to have my own copy

[02:29:17.560 --> 02:29:19.800]
So it's like real nice and crisp and clear you know

[02:29:19.800 --> 02:29:20.340]
That's right

[02:29:21.380 --> 02:29:22.680]
The crisp and queer

[02:29:22.680 --> 02:29:23.940]
Why do you say such crap?

[02:29:23.940 --> 02:29:26.120]
You know, you would know Emil Hersh from Sunnyhurst

[02:29:26.120 --> 02:29:28.680]
I saw that much boy at least as much of a design

[02:29:28.680 --> 02:29:29.560]
Well that's a movie

[02:29:29.560 --> 02:29:30.460]
It's just a movie

[02:29:30.460 --> 02:29:31.480]
It's because he was...

[02:29:31.480 --> 02:29:32.680]
I don't know anything about him personally

[02:29:32.680 --> 02:29:33.580]
Well there you go

[02:29:33.580 --> 02:29:35.800]
Maybe he's getting more ass than you'll ever get

[02:29:35.800 --> 02:29:36.760]
Well, I'm sorry

[02:29:36.760 --> 02:29:37.580]
I'm sorry, okay

[02:29:37.580 --> 02:29:38.800]
Moving along

[02:29:39.460 --> 02:29:39.900]
Hahaha

[02:29:40.800 --> 02:29:41.240]
Oh

[02:29:42.620 --> 02:29:44.080]
I sure fell into that one

[02:29:44.860 --> 02:29:46.320]
Oops, wouldn't be the first part

[02:29:46.320 --> 02:29:48.880]
Heat, Wizard of Oz, Joe Dirt

[02:29:49.340 --> 02:29:51.040]
Blazing Saddles, my cousin Vinnie

[02:29:51.040 --> 02:29:52.620]
I mean, I'm reading this list and out

[02:29:52.620 --> 02:29:53.640]
You know, to reach his own

[02:29:53.640 --> 02:29:54.540]
We're asking your opinion

[02:29:55.280 --> 02:29:56.720]
Plains, trains and automobiles

[02:29:56.720 --> 02:29:59.260]
Well that's Steve Schmach-Mendrick

[02:29:59.880 --> 02:30:00.880]
Steve Martin, John Gaffer

[02:30:00.880 --> 02:30:01.160]
Martin?

[02:30:01.160 --> 02:30:01.620]
Yeah

[02:30:02.160 --> 02:30:02.900]
I saw it

[02:30:02.900 --> 02:30:03.620]
Yeah, I saw it

[02:30:03.620 --> 02:30:04.120]
That was okay

[02:30:04.120 --> 02:30:05.560]
West Side Story

[02:30:06.160 --> 02:30:06.520]
Minority Report

[02:30:07.160 --> 02:30:07.740]
Reservoir Dogs

[02:30:07.740 --> 02:30:09.740]
Or that Reserveer Dogs

[02:30:09.740 --> 02:30:10.580]
The Great Escape

[02:30:10.580 --> 02:30:11.220]
The Natural

[02:30:11.220 --> 02:30:12.700]
Oh Robert Redford Movie

[02:30:14.020 --> 02:30:15.160]
Rounders, Letter Ride

[02:30:15.160 --> 02:30:16.500]
Pulp Fiction or Roger Rabbit

[02:30:17.180 --> 02:30:19.460]
That was the guy's name at Passion Roger

[02:30:20.160 --> 02:30:20.420]
Roger?

[02:30:20.980 --> 02:30:21.540]
Yeah

[02:30:22.160 --> 02:30:23.220]
Remember that?

[02:30:23.440 --> 02:30:23.840]
Yes

[02:30:23.840 --> 02:30:25.440]
I'll think of his last name

[02:30:25.440 --> 02:30:26.540]
Evil, Evil One

[02:30:26.540 --> 02:30:27.980]
Who was always going to email me this

[02:30:27.980 --> 02:30:29.160]
And email me

[02:30:29.160 --> 02:30:30.420]
I'll email you a mom, okay Roger?

[02:30:30.680 --> 02:30:31.240]
Whatever his name was

[02:30:31.240 --> 02:30:31.920]
You know who I mean?

[02:30:32.140 --> 02:30:32.820]
Not Roger Dirt

[02:30:34.340 --> 02:30:34.740]
Not Roger Dirt

[02:30:34.740 --> 02:30:35.580]
God, Evil, Evil Do

[02:30:35.580 --> 02:30:37.540]
Another one, Incorporate to Jackass

[02:30:38.160 --> 02:30:40.400]
Is Tyden Hollywood, Chronic

[02:30:40.400 --> 02:30:42.120]
Kevin Hurn from Tyden Long Time, okay?

[02:30:42.840 --> 02:30:44.380]
Aaron Miracca is currently running

[02:30:44.380 --> 02:30:47.140]
Al Franken and Jim Rohn simultaneously

[02:30:47.560 --> 02:30:50.460]
And nobody is picking up the data-broward numbers for INZ

[02:30:51.060 --> 02:30:52.800]
Is this clear channel trying to get a new format?

[02:30:54.220 --> 02:30:56.260]
They still suck and so does what I love to do

[02:30:56.260 --> 02:30:56.900]
It's just Tyden

[02:30:56.900 --> 02:30:58.680]
Let me see if I can read that again

[02:30:58.680 --> 02:31:02.780]
Aaron Miracca is currently running Al Franken and Jim Rohn simultaneously

[02:31:03.600 --> 02:31:06.740]
And nobody is picking up the data-broward numbers for our WINZ

[02:31:07.980 --> 02:31:09.160]
What does that mean?

[02:31:09.460 --> 02:31:10.440]
I don't understand what that means

[02:31:11.240 --> 02:31:11.840]
What part?

[02:31:12.240 --> 02:31:14.920]
Oh, in other words, I guess what he's saying is they're calling in

[02:31:14.920 --> 02:31:16.900]
Well, what are you doing listening over there anyway, Todd?

[02:31:17.600 --> 02:31:17.700]
Huh?

[02:31:18.040 --> 02:31:18.140]
Huh?

[02:31:20.300 --> 02:31:21.700]
Call them and they're trying to help them out

[02:31:21.700 --> 02:31:22.880]
Don't call, let them continue

[02:31:22.880 --> 02:31:25.640]
Maybe they're trying to let us think they can combine those two shows

[02:31:25.640 --> 02:31:27.020]
They can get a number and get about a three

[02:31:27.020 --> 02:31:27.980]
Yeah, double the chance

[02:31:27.980 --> 02:31:30.640]
Al Franken get about a point nine and Roman get about a one-one

[02:31:30.640 --> 02:31:31.920]
Like I said, get a two

[02:31:32.920 --> 02:31:33.720]
What's it to you?

[02:31:35.180 --> 02:31:35.580]
5670560

[02:31:35.580 --> 02:31:38.680]
I guarantee you Al Franken don't take stupid polls on his show

[02:31:38.680 --> 02:31:40.200]
And he sure as hell don't have no audience here

[02:31:40.960 --> 02:31:42.020]
Dominic QA and hello

[02:31:42.020 --> 02:31:43.440]
Hey, Neil, how are you?

[02:31:43.580 --> 02:31:43.900]
All right

[02:31:43.900 --> 02:31:46.100]
Got a couple for the two different polls

[02:31:46.100 --> 02:31:46.740]
Yep

[02:31:46.740 --> 02:31:48.080]
One is Spartacus

[02:31:48.080 --> 02:31:48.860]
Okay

[02:31:48.860 --> 02:31:50.020]
And the Spartacus

[02:31:50.660 --> 02:31:53.300]
With Tony Curtis and the Spartacus

[02:31:53.300 --> 02:31:55.240]
Yeah, I am Spartacus

[02:31:55.240 --> 02:31:58.160]
And the other would be Ariel Sharon for the murder

[02:31:58.600 --> 02:31:59.680]
Oh, good choice

[02:31:59.680 --> 02:32:01.540]
And by the way, how's he doing lately?

[02:32:02.140 --> 02:32:02.780]
He's a vegetable

[02:32:04.040 --> 02:32:06.040]
I hope it's kosher, okay, thanks

[02:32:06.040 --> 02:32:06.720]
Okay, bye

[02:32:07.180 --> 02:32:09.120]
Are they not in kosher vegetables?

[02:32:10.260 --> 02:32:11.500]
I don't think so

[02:32:11.500 --> 02:32:11.780]
Okay

[02:32:14.460 --> 02:32:14.900]
Trifestible?

[02:32:15.080 --> 02:32:15.800]
Yeah, Rootabega

[02:32:16.300 --> 02:32:16.960]
I don't know

[02:32:16.960 --> 02:32:20.720]
I don't know, I know that Borst is good with horse radish on it

[02:32:20.720 --> 02:32:21.940]
Ooh, you ever eat Borst?

[02:32:22.100 --> 02:32:22.900]
You ever eat horse radish?

[02:32:23.280 --> 02:32:25.400]
Actually, it's kosher, the worst radish on Gafilta fish

[02:32:25.400 --> 02:32:28.020]
And don't be telling Josh not to eat Gafilta fish

[02:32:28.020 --> 02:32:30.280]
Although it's really, you like to show it's kind of tasteless

[02:32:31.080 --> 02:32:31.960]
But what I told you

[02:32:31.960 --> 02:32:36.580]
Look at Ariel Sharon on there, but is it interesting that we hear absolutely nothing?

[02:32:37.280 --> 02:32:37.640]
Zero!

[02:32:38.260 --> 02:32:38.620]
Nothing!

[02:32:39.260 --> 02:32:42.860]
This guy could have been dead for the last month, for all we know, and possibly, you know

[02:32:44.320 --> 02:32:45.420]
How do you like that?

[02:32:48.060 --> 02:32:49.940]
I mean, talk about conspicuous bias

[02:32:49.940 --> 02:32:52.380]
Absence is a little bit, does this strike you a little bit strange?

[02:32:52.880 --> 02:32:56.660]
And on the first, the first few days thereafter, the second massive stroke

[02:32:56.660 --> 02:32:59.580]
We're hearing about a beep, but just like, yes, I'm a fart

[02:33:00.720 --> 02:33:04.400]
We weren't hearing anything at all, he was dead, he wasn't dead, all kinds of...

[02:33:04.400 --> 02:33:07.160]
Oh, completely reports, all kinds of stories out there on the street

[02:33:08.620 --> 02:33:11.100]
And Clements, and the son he was saying, who said that?

[02:33:11.240 --> 02:33:12.860]
If we lose the old man, who said that?

[02:33:12.940 --> 02:33:14.140]
Or that was Robert Dubal?

[02:33:14.640 --> 02:33:14.760]
Yeah

[02:33:14.760 --> 02:33:15.120]
Yeah

[02:33:15.120 --> 02:33:18.940]
So that, if we lose the old man, that's what George is saying to Josh all the time

[02:33:18.940 --> 02:33:20.640]
We lose the old man, or an employee

[02:33:21.080 --> 02:33:23.900]
Yeah, no, you're... what are you talking about? Joe Bell loves you

[02:33:23.900 --> 02:33:25.300]
He says you're adequate

[02:33:26.060 --> 02:33:27.300]
Well, I'll take it

[02:33:27.940 --> 02:33:29.520]
Which is an improvement over the previous stuff up

[02:33:29.520 --> 02:33:33.200]
The previous guy said you were unadequated, which isn't even the right grammar

[02:33:34.400 --> 02:33:35.200]
WQAM, hello

[02:33:35.720 --> 02:33:36.420]
Hi, Neil

[02:33:36.420 --> 02:33:37.480]
Yes, ma'am

[02:33:37.480 --> 02:33:39.880]
Listen, did you hear the Don Stewart died?

[02:33:40.720 --> 02:33:40.940]
Who?

[02:33:41.320 --> 02:33:43.120]
Don Stewart, he played my power

[02:33:43.120 --> 02:33:45.140]
Don Stewart, oh Don Stewart

[02:33:45.140 --> 02:33:45.940]
Yeah, Don Stewart

[02:33:45.940 --> 02:33:47.720]
I played my dance Stewart, dance it

[02:33:47.720 --> 02:33:48.760]
Oh, we're fine

[02:33:48.760 --> 02:33:51.140]
Wow, isn't that a shame, you know, he's only 110 years old

[02:33:51.140 --> 02:33:54.620]
Maybe that's why he wasn't into power picnic this summer

[02:33:55.420 --> 02:33:56.460]
That's a bummer

[02:33:56.460 --> 02:33:56.760]
Yeah

[02:33:57.260 --> 02:33:58.720]
And whatever happened to fill up

[02:33:58.720 --> 02:34:02.300]
Whatever happened to fill up that was supposed to be still live, was supposed to forget about it, huh?

[02:34:02.500 --> 02:34:04.000]
He refused to come back on the show

[02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:05.080]
Was that what it was?

[02:34:05.280 --> 02:34:05.380]
Yeah

[02:34:05.800 --> 02:34:07.000]
Well, are you kidding me?

[02:34:07.120 --> 02:34:07.420]
He got it right

[02:34:07.420 --> 02:34:12.300]
So in other words, they give us this funny storyline, and they set up this whole funny marriage between Beth and Alan

[02:34:12.300 --> 02:34:16.600]
Based on Philip is going to get through on it, and all of a sudden he is going back on the show, we'll screw him

[02:34:16.600 --> 02:34:20.260]
Right, they thought they'd bring him back, but he refused to come back

[02:34:20.260 --> 02:34:23.580]
Look like he had the skin pulled over him, the bones on his face, he was so gone

[02:34:23.580 --> 02:34:24.260]
Okay, thanks

[02:34:24.260 --> 02:34:24.840]
All right, bye

[02:34:24.840 --> 02:34:25.660]
Thanks for the bad news

[02:34:25.660 --> 02:34:28.600]
Don Stewart is dead, he played my power in a guiding life for him to the years

[02:34:28.600 --> 02:34:30.800]
And every year he'd come back on the show for like one day

[02:34:30.800 --> 02:34:34.520]
Christmas time, you know, maybe Papa Bauer and Bert Bauer coming back too

[02:34:35.840 --> 02:34:36.880]
Remember all the powers?

[02:34:37.200 --> 02:34:38.320]
Hank Bauer, Johnny Bauer?

[02:34:39.220 --> 02:34:41.980]
Steve Garner's Sauer, Stephen Bauer and Michelle Bauer from the movie

[02:34:41.980 --> 02:34:46.560]
Yes, Stephen Bauer, my buddy, what was the movie? He was in my tour today, he was a...what was that movie?

[02:34:46.780 --> 02:34:48.480]
Oh, that's the one he just saw, isn't it?

[02:34:48.860 --> 02:34:49.720]
What was he in sleepers?

[02:34:51.400 --> 02:34:51.900]
Which one?

[02:34:52.420 --> 02:34:54.920]
The one that he just saw with Edward Norton, the one I just sent you

[02:34:54.920 --> 02:34:56.120]
Oh, he wasn't that

[02:34:57.020 --> 02:34:58.040]
Yeah, he was a good actor

[02:34:58.580 --> 02:35:01.040]
Right, he was kind of like his small time principal, a friend of mine

[02:35:01.040 --> 02:35:03.280]
He was a primal fear, he was in there, Stephen Bauer

[02:35:03.280 --> 02:35:06.480]
He's got, he's a pretty good actor, he's got a lot to cry about him, but he's a good actor

[02:35:06.900 --> 02:35:09.060]
He's had his issues, but then again, who hasn't?

[02:35:09.580 --> 02:35:12.760]
Let's see, Dumb and Dumber and Jurassic Park and Jaws

[02:35:12.760 --> 02:35:17.400]
There's just too many movies on here, so I'm just going to show the whole thing away from iodine

[02:35:18.360 --> 02:35:22.340]
No, that's seriously, give us one, maybe I'll get you to catch a little slack,

[02:35:22.500 --> 02:35:26.440]
Roberta Flack can give you two, but not a list of every movie that was ever made

[02:35:27.560 --> 02:35:30.160]
Jesus Christ, I'm sorry, I just don't buy that

[02:35:30.160 --> 02:35:33.120]
There just aren't that many movies that I want to say, I mean, there are a few

[02:35:33.740 --> 02:35:36.900]
But over and over, I don't think they understand the magnitude of this

[02:35:37.460 --> 02:35:40.500]
Like if imaginary heroes was on every night, I'd watch it every day

[02:35:41.260 --> 02:35:43.760]
For a while, and of course, I'd start puking from it

[02:35:43.760 --> 02:35:44.760]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:35:45.220 --> 02:35:48.240]
Yeah, well, you didn't like it quite that much, no that quite

[02:35:48.240 --> 02:35:52.920]
But I just, I don't know, I just thought it was, and you're always, like I said,

[02:35:52.980 --> 02:35:57.760]
you're always complaining about Lausie endings, and had a granted, it was a therapy ending, but an end read, okay?

[02:35:58.060 --> 02:36:00.780]
Because they're not at last, but there are other questions that we have

[02:36:00.780 --> 02:36:03.840]
They're at least an I'm thinking about, like maybe what happened after that, you know?

[02:36:03.840 --> 02:36:06.540]
Well, that's not so much of a question, is you just wanted to keep going

[02:36:07.020 --> 02:36:09.060]
Yeah, I sure do, I want to see what's going on

[02:36:09.060 --> 02:36:09.960]
Where it goes, yeah

[02:36:09.960 --> 02:36:13.440]
Yeah, I know exactly where that one's going, where it's ending up

[02:36:13.440 --> 02:36:14.540]
Ha ha ha

[02:36:15.240 --> 02:36:18.840]
12 minutes after one, hey, listen, you're the guy that sent me a bear-back cowboy

[02:36:18.840 --> 02:36:21.220]
I'm not sure I can't wait talking to him in a day

[02:36:21.660 --> 02:36:23.100]
I don't know if I want to watch that

[02:36:23.100 --> 02:36:24.340]
Oh, you have to, you have to

[02:36:24.340 --> 02:36:28.440]
For the sake of the guy who was in Donnie Dark when he died in the end, so to speak

[02:36:28.860 --> 02:36:32.000]
But it's well, maybe I'll send you Donnie Dark, will I? God, did you want it?

[02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:36.860]
Yeah, I'll ship it out to you, I got it right in the other room I've seen it, it's a very good movie

[02:36:37.380 --> 02:36:40.760]
Just because Josh has all been out of shape that he ruined the ending for everybody he dies

[02:36:41.680 --> 02:36:45.580]
I mean, isn't that what the whole movie is leading up to anyway, that he's supposed to die?

[02:36:45.760 --> 02:36:47.120]
I don't care that you ruined it anyway

[02:36:47.120 --> 02:36:47.380]
Not really

[02:36:47.980 --> 02:36:49.080]
It's not? No

[02:36:49.420 --> 02:36:50.860]
Well, he keeps thinking that though

[02:36:51.840 --> 02:36:53.280]
We don't want to let him down

[02:36:54.440 --> 02:36:59.340]
And in Jake Killinghall's case, maybe he should have died before he got to, you know, before he was kind of bottomed out

[02:36:59.340 --> 02:37:00.240]
If you point that expression

[02:37:00.760 --> 02:37:01.320]
Right, Tom

[02:37:02.240 --> 02:37:06.420]
That's what the George told me, and that coin is supposed to see he's ledger to me

[02:37:06.420 --> 02:37:10.660]
I still say I don't get it, I don't know what the deal is, I'm sure he's a good actor

[02:37:10.660 --> 02:37:12.240]
That what did I see him in, I saw him in somewhere

[02:37:13.060 --> 02:37:13.840]
What was he in?

[02:37:14.200 --> 02:37:15.640]
Oh, Monster's ball ball

[02:37:15.640 --> 02:37:17.320]
Yeah, he was fine in that movie

[02:37:17.320 --> 02:37:21.560]
He was fine, I mean, he didn't have like the major role in that movie, but he was fine, he did okay

[02:37:22.060 --> 02:37:26.800]
But that's what he impresses me as he's like not like a great leading actor

[02:37:26.800 --> 02:37:28.980]
And they're making such a big fuss about him

[02:37:28.980 --> 02:37:33.180]
That's the tale of there's a, we need great dearth of, you know, you got your Jude Law

[02:37:34.760 --> 02:37:38.840]
And who else? I mean, you know, Matt Damon, hey Matt, you're fair

[02:37:38.840 --> 02:37:40.840]
And what else?

[02:37:42.280 --> 02:37:43.080]
Great things

[02:37:43.860 --> 02:37:45.320]
Like I said, rest my case

[02:37:45.320 --> 02:37:47.500]
Do not, I beg you

[02:37:47.500 --> 02:37:51.000]
Do not see, I mean, that movie got so much hype and it got all the awards

[02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:54.400]
The constant gardener, you'll have a constant adjunct on your puppet

[02:37:54.400 --> 02:37:55.780]
Really, when you see that, I'll pass

[02:37:56.400 --> 02:37:59.980]
El Paso, believe me, he is just so boring

[02:38:00.980 --> 02:38:05.500]

This is Neil Rogers, next is 5.69 A.S

[02:39:18.620 --> 02:39:21.480]
George Bush doesn't care about black people

[02:39:21.480 --> 02:39:22.940]
Don't you do it?

[02:39:23.580 --> 02:39:29.420]
If anybody has a opinion, they're sending from our way

[02:39:30.540 --> 02:39:37.220]
We'll pay your name into the system, and enemy of the state

[02:39:38.200 --> 02:39:44.580]
Don't even bother to question, just follow what you say

[02:39:46.720 --> 02:39:59.640]
Everybody's sending flags, access to SD, in the active Adrian, they're washing all of you

[02:40:01.480 --> 02:40:08.640]
Everyone's a citizen, so why should you do this?

[02:40:09.200 --> 02:40:13.800]
This is deportation, and are you right?

[02:40:14.400 --> 02:40:22.000]
Let's move this, in whose fatherlandation, access USA

[02:40:23.420 --> 02:40:29.920]
Yes, I'd hate those Jews, and Clinton's Ibaros Jews

[02:40:31.240 --> 02:40:37.740]
Believe everything we can, and the state run news

[02:40:39.340 --> 02:40:44.760]
Bloodworn for torment, fill up your heads today

[02:40:46.160 --> 02:40:52.160]
A roof and chainy bush venue, access USA

[02:40:53.980 --> 02:41:00.380]
We don't like to see our job flow, but by the time of his war

[02:41:01.340 --> 02:41:08.660]
We're fascinated by jail, no reason or stupid war

[02:41:09.320 --> 02:41:15.300]
All the war is crazy, the tax of American way

[02:41:17.780 --> 02:41:22.380]
Everybody's turning five years, like a USA

[02:41:24.360 --> 02:41:28.620]
One 19 a.Q.A.M. I don't know why he's sending to those iodine factors

[02:41:28.620 --> 02:41:30.440]
From wherever that person is named iodine

[02:41:30.440 --> 02:41:30.920]
Yeah

[02:41:30.920 --> 02:41:33.580]
Because it burns man, burns my ass

[02:41:33.580 --> 02:41:34.660]
That says Indy

[02:41:35.160 --> 02:41:39.200]
Well, whatever the hell it says, I don't know what it says, but you know, they keep adding to the list

[02:41:39.200 --> 02:41:42.820]
Here's another iodine, whatever, I'm dying from that

[02:41:43.180 --> 02:41:44.380]
I'm dying over here

[02:41:44.380 --> 02:41:49.760]
I'm writing a more pictures show for the poor, and I see that's right up the alley, because there are a lot of people because it's a cult classic

[02:41:49.760 --> 02:41:51.980]
Well, it's a thing to do, not a thing to watch

[02:41:52.940 --> 02:41:55.780]
And well, I may be the throught to make this a TV screen, how do you know?

[02:41:56.500 --> 02:41:57.800]
You don't watch it on TV

[02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.760]
You can, but that's not how it's done

[02:42:02.760 --> 02:42:04.100]
It's not part of the routine

[02:42:04.760 --> 02:42:07.640]
You gotta go there, no friend, lice in your hair

[02:42:07.640 --> 02:42:09.900]
Dutch Prime Minister calls for global calm

[02:42:10.980 --> 02:42:13.580]
Did I say ducts or Danish? Did I say Dutch?

[02:42:13.940 --> 02:42:14.500]
Did you say Dutch?

[02:42:14.960 --> 02:42:16.940]
No, men, Danish, same difference, not

[02:42:17.560 --> 02:42:22.800]
Denmark's Prime Minister on Tuesday called protest over drawings that they profit my hammered a global crisis and appeal for calm

[02:42:22.800 --> 02:42:24.760]
Calm down, you maniacs

[02:42:25.980 --> 02:42:29.440]
We're now facing a growing global crisis under his foot, Rosmussen said

[02:42:29.440 --> 02:42:31.660]
It found something else than drawings in Jalens Posten

[02:42:32.200 --> 02:42:37.760]
The Jalens Posten, a Danish newspaper, first published a drawings that has sparked violent protest in Muslim countries worldwide

[02:42:37.760 --> 02:42:39.860]
They've since been reprinted and medi-round the world

[02:42:40.440 --> 02:42:43.600]
And the Muslims are just rattling their spears and yanking their burkas

[02:42:45.420 --> 02:42:49.440]
Demonstrators in Afghanistan today clax with NATO forces and three protestors were killed

[02:42:49.440 --> 02:42:53.720]
Now it's become an international political matter, he said, I urge common steadiness

[02:42:54.640 --> 02:42:59.720]
Outrage Muslim demonstrators who said, fairly Danish embassies in Syria and Lebanon have held chaotic protests elsewhere

[02:43:00.240 --> 02:43:05.040]
The demand of the Danish government of Pologize for the cartoon, which Ireland's Posten printed way back in September

[02:43:05.040 --> 02:43:08.760]
This is the middle of February already and it just got around to stirring everybody up

[02:43:09.660 --> 02:43:15.760]
But if all Rosmussen statements indicated that Denmark is not contemplating changing, it's strategy for responding to these spiraling tensions

[02:43:15.760 --> 02:43:21.400]
Rosmussen insisted that Denmark's press freedom culture means the government cannot apologize for what an independent newspaper does

[02:43:22.380 --> 02:43:28.960]
In other words, they don't have government-controlled newspapers, unlike in the USA, government-controlled media

[02:43:29.940 --> 02:43:36.120]
The newspapers apologize for any offense caused to Muslims but as defendants printing of the drawings as legitimate exercise and freedom of expression

[02:43:36.120 --> 02:43:41.140]
The drawings, including one depicting the proper wearing of turban-shaped as a bomb, have touched Iran nerve in part

[02:43:41.140 --> 02:43:46.040]
Because Islam has interpreted it forbid any illustrations of the Prophet Muhammad for freedom to lead to idolatry

[02:43:46.620 --> 02:43:47.740]
Or is that adultery?

[02:43:48.200 --> 02:43:53.460]
We appeal the Muslims around the world to look beyond the headlines of the rhetoric for Mr. Per Stigmour

[02:43:53.460 --> 02:43:55.120]
who said alongside Fog Rosmussen

[02:43:55.920 --> 02:44:01.880]
Earlier the Foreign Ministry said the Danish embassy in Jakarta didn't need to be temporarily closed because it appears it would be storm-dited

[02:44:02.660 --> 02:44:06.020]
Niels Erich Anderson, I wonder if he's going to hand Christian Anderson, you think?

[02:44:06.860 --> 02:44:07.500]
I'll put it

[02:44:07.500 --> 02:44:09.740]
Denmark's ambassador, hands down, he gets the job

[02:44:09.740 --> 02:44:16.080]
Denmark's ambassador, Indonesia said Muslims were starting to need to have been burning Danish flags and effigies at Fog Rosmussen

[02:44:16.620 --> 02:44:17.580]
How do you like that?

[02:44:18.020 --> 02:44:20.580]
Talk about making a big simous about nothing

[02:44:21.740 --> 02:44:24.660]
Partunes came out in September that makes it even more ludicrous

[02:44:24.660 --> 02:44:27.740]
You know, I read that, remind me to read it again tomorrow

[02:44:29.320 --> 02:44:31.060]
That's what the best things I've ever read in my life

[02:44:31.060 --> 02:44:33.780]
And if you had told me I would be reading the Christian or Hitchens call, huh?

[02:44:34.420 --> 02:44:34.960]
You'd be both

[02:44:34.960 --> 02:44:40.800]
The case for mocking religion, I just emailed it to Erich, to a Joshua, both

[02:44:42.180 --> 02:44:47.420]
We ought to put that on here, keep it on here because, boy, there's for all of his other failings, I believe he's got many of them

[02:44:47.420 --> 02:44:48.920]
He makes me want to borrow most of the time

[02:44:48.920 --> 02:44:52.120]
But boy, you talk about somebody who came out and told it exactly like it is

[02:44:53.580 --> 02:44:58.460]
All you, haven't I told you that's what the world is all about today? It's religious phonetics against the rest of us

[02:44:58.460 --> 02:45:00.440]
Leave us alone, they won't do it

[02:45:01.380 --> 02:45:04.020]
They're just dragging us down to the gutter of stupidity with them

[02:45:04.020 --> 02:45:08.560]
While of course a whole bunch of other lunatics are busy trying to squeeze every dime I can out of our ass

[02:45:09.840 --> 02:45:12.600]
But we're going to be exploring those alternative forms of energy

[02:45:12.600 --> 02:45:15.860]
And we're going to begin away from that dependence on Middle Eastern oil

[02:45:15.860 --> 02:45:17.880]
Right, right

[02:45:18.480 --> 02:45:19.960]
Who the hell are you kidding?

[02:45:21.680 --> 02:45:23.840]
Band-Afford easy-ex so there'll be sold in stores

[02:45:25.620 --> 02:45:29.020]
A new soda promising to sexually arise the person drinking it

[02:45:29.020 --> 02:45:31.480]
Will soon be available in stores nationwide

[02:45:32.980 --> 02:45:37.800]
The drink called Turnon is made with Guarana, Jinsing and Caffeine

[02:45:37.800 --> 02:45:41.780]
The soda was banned in France and Denmark see what a bunch of trouble makers there

[02:45:41.780 --> 02:45:44.500]
But makers insisted safe and worse isn't an afford easy act

[02:45:45.300 --> 02:45:47.800]
People who have tested the soda said it tastes like cherry soda

[02:45:49.300 --> 02:45:51.720]
Mmm, see a little something the subliminal there?

[02:45:52.040 --> 02:45:52.380]
I get it

[02:45:52.380 --> 02:45:55.860]
We watched the film and then afterward I felt like my senses were more like Turnon

[02:45:55.860 --> 02:45:58.840]
I looked at the feel more, I felt more on my skin at the tester said

[02:45:58.840 --> 02:46:01.960]
Maybe they got an ass, maybe they got like rats or skates

[02:46:01.960 --> 02:46:03.420]
That could be it

[02:46:03.840 --> 02:46:06.100]
Doctors have already warned that the drink is not for everybody

[02:46:06.100 --> 02:46:10.940]
Children pregnant women and people with high blood pressure and diabetes should avoid the drink quarterly for it

[02:46:10.940 --> 02:46:11.900]
It's probably over to its sugar

[02:46:12.600 --> 02:46:15.540]
A warning label on the can claims this beverage will arouse you

[02:46:16.400 --> 02:46:18.800]
I think Tom Cruise has the same warning label on his can

[02:46:20.040 --> 02:46:22.140]
Turnon is sold online for three and a half bucks a can

[02:46:22.140 --> 02:46:23.260]
Will soon be available in stores

[02:46:23.260 --> 02:46:24.180]
Got the idea

[02:46:24.180 --> 02:46:26.000]
I don't like that Turnon be watching for it

[02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:29.180]
Just like that Jolt soda you know that they make the Rochester right across the lake

[02:46:29.180 --> 02:46:30.020]
That's the thing

[02:46:30.800 --> 02:46:32.700]
That's the stuff that the suds was drinking wasn't it?

[02:46:32.740 --> 02:46:32.940]
Mmm-hmm

[02:46:32.940 --> 02:46:33.480]
By the gallon

[02:46:33.480 --> 02:46:33.820]
Sure

[02:46:33.820 --> 02:46:35.700]
I wonder he's always whipped up

[02:46:35.700 --> 02:46:37.320]
W.A.C.Y.N. Hello

[02:46:38.360 --> 02:46:39.960]
Q.A.M. Yes

[02:46:39.960 --> 02:46:40.460]
Yeah

[02:46:40.460 --> 02:46:42.940]
Hey, don't watch Resort Dog

[02:46:42.940 --> 02:46:45.200]
It was okay, you're not going to like it

[02:46:45.200 --> 02:46:47.280]
That's what George keeps telling me I would hate it

[02:46:47.280 --> 02:46:50.940]
Yeah, if I'd ever saw it, it would have been a little bit guilty

[02:46:50.940 --> 02:46:51.540]
Okay

[02:46:51.540 --> 02:46:56.280]
Is it ironic that the people who are who was responsible for 9-11

[02:46:56.280 --> 02:46:57.940]
Which is the Bush administration

[02:46:57.940 --> 02:46:59.620]
Perhaps they're really doing nothing

[02:47:00.160 --> 02:47:02.260]
When they had warnings that we were going to get attacked

[02:47:02.260 --> 02:47:05.880]
Who's questioning these hatreds and who love that average American citizens

[02:47:05.880 --> 02:47:10.940]
And isn't it really interesting since they've told us about the Great War on terror that they're fighting

[02:47:10.940 --> 02:47:13.400]
That all these drag hits from who bombed the U.S.S. School

[02:47:13.400 --> 02:47:16.120]
Just escaped in Yemen the other day, how do you like that?

[02:47:16.520 --> 02:47:18.480]
So they're going to have a bunch of al-Kaeda in the world

[02:47:18.480 --> 02:47:19.620]
Yeah, yeah

[02:47:20.440 --> 02:47:20.440]

[02:47:20.440 --> 02:47:22.280]
How did they let them out? How come they're still alive

[02:47:22.280 --> 02:47:25.400]
And they're going to a great job of protecting us against these slime balls in the world

[02:47:25.400 --> 02:47:28.480]
And they can't even keep them behind bars for quite for Yarsby's sake

[02:47:28.480 --> 02:47:30.540]
Yeah, because they're all in it

[02:47:30.540 --> 02:47:31.280]
Okay

[02:47:31.280 --> 02:47:32.780]
They're all in bed together, baby

[02:47:32.780 --> 02:47:36.000]
It's one, they're like, I told you, like Josh's favorite movie

[02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:37.860]
The world is a business Mr. Beale

[02:47:39.360 --> 02:47:42.440]
Everybody should be forced to watch that scene including Josh Kordes

[02:47:42.440 --> 02:47:44.600]
Who just don't even understand what that seems all about

[02:47:44.600 --> 02:47:46.160]
When you're making the kind of money he has

[02:47:46.160 --> 02:47:48.580]
When he's starting into finance that's beyond his scope

[02:47:49.360 --> 02:47:51.220]
He can't even afford a bottle of scope

[02:47:52.340 --> 02:47:54.640]
Try that orange-listering man's good stuff

[02:47:54.640 --> 02:47:56.080]
You tell me you're using it?

[02:47:56.300 --> 02:47:57.020]
Yeah, that's Henry

[02:47:57.020 --> 02:47:59.900]
Boy, that's the tangerine for a real queen man

[02:47:59.900 --> 02:48:00.980]
That is the best I've seen

[02:48:00.980 --> 02:48:04.460]
Oh man, it's a little on the mean side but leave it to listerine

[02:48:04.460 --> 02:48:07.460]
No seriously, you can't switch it around and you're about too long

[02:48:09.040 --> 02:48:09.660]
Can you?

[02:48:10.040 --> 02:48:11.460]
Yeah, I can't, I'm used to it

[02:48:11.460 --> 02:48:12.040]
Really?

[02:48:12.440 --> 02:48:12.740]
Yeah

[02:48:12.740 --> 02:48:14.160]
He's an excellent swine

[02:48:14.160 --> 02:48:17.480]
Boy, I'll tell you I can get Jewish just wild now

[02:48:17.480 --> 02:48:18.140]
But I'll pass

[02:48:18.140 --> 02:48:19.100]
Don't do it

[02:48:19.100 --> 02:48:20.120]
And Josh

[02:48:21.220 --> 02:48:22.080]
27 way

[02:48:22.600 --> 02:48:23.500]
Oh, I will

[02:48:24.260 --> 02:48:26.320]
27 after 1 to 560 WNK

[02:48:26.320 --> 02:48:29.060]
Curtis for the slot, for the most slot

[02:48:30.280 --> 02:48:31.240]
Between two and four

[02:48:31.240 --> 02:48:33.620]
And Jacques Martin, the coach of your Florida Panthers,

[02:48:34.020 --> 02:48:35.900]
That's three o'clock because it goes with the territory

[02:48:35.900 --> 02:48:37.020]
We have to give him some time

[02:48:37.020 --> 02:48:40.580]
And you know, and they got, the Panthers got some inventory

[02:48:40.580 --> 02:48:42.680]
Remember the day that Muff told us that they got some inventory?

[02:48:43.660 --> 02:48:44.020]
Yeah

[02:48:44.020 --> 02:48:46.760]
You know, when we start selling some real spots on the station

[02:48:46.760 --> 02:48:47.860]
Then it'll be really exciting

[02:48:47.860 --> 02:48:50.240]
If you're going to did a good job, if you're underpaid,

[02:48:50.240 --> 02:48:52.480]

[02:48:53.980 --> 02:48:56.520]

1-866 fast train

[02:49:45.680 --> 02:49:47.500]
This is Neil Rogers

[02:49:47.500 --> 02:49:51.620]
Oh, this is 5.62 AF

[02:49:55.760 --> 02:49:57.080]
Live in Chicago

[02:49:58.660 --> 02:49:59.140]
Oprah

[02:50:00.040 --> 02:50:03.000]
I've been in television since I was 19 years old

[02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.880]
And I have never been in this position

[02:50:05.880 --> 02:50:06.440]
I feel good

[02:50:06.440 --> 02:50:07.880]
As you may have heard

[02:50:08.400 --> 02:50:09.800]
Excuse me, hello Oprah?

[02:50:10.060 --> 02:50:10.180]
Yes

[02:50:10.180 --> 02:50:12.960]
Yeah, this is Steadman. I'm calling it on your show

[02:50:12.960 --> 02:50:14.060]
From New York

[02:50:14.060 --> 02:50:17.360]
And I wanted to tell you that I've lied to you too

[02:50:17.360 --> 02:50:19.740]
I know we've been together for several years

[02:50:19.740 --> 02:50:22.280]
But I'm actually married to somebody else

[02:50:22.280 --> 02:50:22.740]
Oh no

[02:50:22.740 --> 02:50:23.660]
I'm really sorry

[02:50:23.660 --> 02:50:24.000]
But

[02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:25.260]
I gotta go

[02:50:25.260 --> 02:50:27.300]
Oh my god, Oprah

[02:50:27.300 --> 02:50:28.800]
I lied to you

[02:50:28.800 --> 02:50:29.720]
Unbelievable

[02:50:29.720 --> 02:50:30.440]
I know

[02:50:30.440 --> 02:50:33.680]
Of all people you think you could trust your gynecologist

[02:50:33.680 --> 02:50:35.100]
Why would you lie?

[02:50:35.600 --> 02:50:37.000]
Oprah, you're a man

[02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:37.740]
Oh no

[02:50:37.740 --> 02:50:38.700]
I'm so sorry

[02:50:39.260 --> 02:50:41.600]
Oh, and you should kick your prostate check now

[02:50:41.600 --> 02:50:42.180]
We'll write that

[02:50:42.700 --> 02:50:45.600]
And the history of human race never has any creature

[02:50:46.420 --> 02:50:48.100]
Male, female or indifferent

[02:50:48.700 --> 02:50:50.680]
Made more money with less talent than that bitch

[02:50:50.680 --> 02:50:53.140]
It just, yeah, grinds my ass

[02:50:53.920 --> 02:50:55.080]
I don't really like anybody

[02:50:55.080 --> 02:50:57.660]
Even Bill Gates, Donald Trump, people that we know

[02:50:58.180 --> 02:50:58.620]
Steinbrenner

[02:50:58.620 --> 02:51:00.960]
I don't be grudged, you know, I mean I like some of those people

[02:51:00.960 --> 02:51:02.360]
But, yeah, they made the money

[02:51:02.880 --> 02:51:04.360]
Ted Turner, whatever

[02:51:04.360 --> 02:51:06.620]
But in her case, I'm like an exception

[02:51:06.620 --> 02:51:09.160]
Because she thinks her stuff don't stink, man

[02:51:09.160 --> 02:51:11.040]
And the woman that she's got brainwashed

[02:51:11.580 --> 02:51:13.360]
That's not, the mother was like a mother religion

[02:51:14.840 --> 02:51:16.940]
See, let me just say this about the Muslims

[02:51:16.940 --> 02:51:19.240]
What they've done is they've taken the Catholics

[02:51:19.240 --> 02:51:20.760]
And they've multiplied times a hundred

[02:51:20.760 --> 02:51:22.620]
In other words, they've done a much better job

[02:51:23.340 --> 02:51:24.600]
Of brainwashing their people

[02:51:25.360 --> 02:51:28.200]
And the reason they can do it is because the Saudi invented

[02:51:28.200 --> 02:51:30.620]
And then Paki continued

[02:51:31.920 --> 02:51:33.600]
Madrasa business where they take the end

[02:51:33.600 --> 02:51:35.880]
And you see them, you see the eclipse of the kids in their schools

[02:51:35.880 --> 02:51:37.260]
And they're sitting in their dovetrain

[02:51:37.260 --> 02:51:38.220]
But it'd be pitiful

[02:51:38.220 --> 02:51:39.720]
And that's all they learn

[02:51:39.720 --> 02:51:40.640]
That's all they learn

[02:51:40.640 --> 02:51:41.740]
It's religious for that

[02:51:41.740 --> 02:51:42.940]
It's when we hate the Jews

[02:51:42.940 --> 02:51:44.900]
And anybody west of India

[02:51:44.900 --> 02:51:46.340]
And that we don't like them either

[02:51:46.960 --> 02:51:48.380]
And it's insanity

[02:51:49.600 --> 02:51:49.960]
Madness

[02:51:50.760 --> 02:51:51.120]
Brainwashing

[02:51:51.120 --> 02:51:52.000]
And brainwashing

[02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:53.480]
And these people are just full of hate

[02:51:55.160 --> 02:51:57.320]
And just like in the God of them, remember we said they hit us?

[02:51:57.440 --> 02:51:58.000]
We got to hit them back?

[02:51:58.220 --> 02:51:59.680]
I said before they get us, we got to get them

[02:51:59.680 --> 02:52:00.100]
That's all

[02:52:00.840 --> 02:52:01.660]
That's what I'm picking

[02:52:02.740 --> 02:52:04.720]
First, very true, when we needed them

[02:52:04.720 --> 02:52:07.320]
So they're all this pussy footing around and I rack

[02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:09.980]
People of Iraq are not the enemy, okay?

[02:52:10.360 --> 02:52:13.320]
Although they're still there now, thanks to us, thanks to your president

[02:52:13.760 --> 02:52:15.300]
So hotbed for lunatics

[02:52:15.300 --> 02:52:18.600]
Just exactly like it was predicted in the Democrats about Alzheimer's

[02:52:18.600 --> 02:52:20.640]
They got CA, can be those timers

[02:52:21.280 --> 02:52:23.800]
And they went around and went and went and went

[02:52:23.800 --> 02:52:24.660]
And it's pathetic

[02:52:24.660 --> 02:52:27.620]
Even on the right-wing websites they're talking about how pathetic it is

[02:52:27.620 --> 02:52:29.160]
Like on this wiretapping business

[02:52:29.980 --> 02:52:31.980]
And a couple, you know, there were a few people yesterday

[02:52:31.980 --> 02:52:35.040]
Like they're digging at the Hurray Village, Asia, Jr., there

[02:52:35.040 --> 02:52:36.280]
Alberto V. O. V. O. 5

[02:52:36.280 --> 02:52:38.200]
But I mean, and then what?

[02:52:39.160 --> 02:52:40.860]
Then what? What happens afterwards?

[02:52:41.420 --> 02:52:43.520]
All the hearings, all the committees, all the time

[02:52:43.520 --> 02:52:45.080]
It just like the 9-11 commission

[02:52:45.080 --> 02:52:50.420]
And every time we turn around, the New Orleans commission, the Katrina commission, the chocolate commission

[02:52:51.400 --> 02:52:53.260]
And yeah, after this is all done, what happens?

[02:52:53.400 --> 02:52:53.960]
Anything? No

[02:52:55.440 --> 02:52:56.980]
And then we move on to some other crap

[02:52:56.980 --> 02:53:00.060]
Like his business with the taking more funding away from PBS

[02:53:01.460 --> 02:53:05.480]
They won't be happy until we have the Heinrich Himmler Hour in Pat Robertson

[02:53:05.480 --> 02:53:07.680]
Are the only shows we can watch 24-7

[02:53:07.680 --> 02:53:11.060]
With an occasion with a daily guest appearance, a photo op by your...

[02:53:11.680 --> 02:53:12.180]
A viewer

[02:53:13.320 --> 02:53:15.320]
There ought to be a major viewer about it, you know?

[02:53:16.200 --> 02:53:16.980]
And there's not

[02:53:16.980 --> 02:53:20.120]
But how about those theaters? We won the Super Bowl, there you go

[02:53:22.160 --> 02:53:24.540]
Who is the most despicable murder of all time?

[02:53:24.780 --> 02:53:28.420]
We got 1,1224 votes. Aren't you amazed at that?

[02:53:28.420 --> 02:53:29.180]
Amazing

[02:53:29.180 --> 02:53:31.580]
Just kind of slid right in there, we slud

[02:53:31.580 --> 02:53:33.740]
Like Disney would say we slud at a third

[02:53:35.560 --> 02:53:37.120]
Hitler 474, no doubt

[02:53:37.120 --> 02:53:38.880]
Well, maybe there is some doubt

[02:53:39.420 --> 02:53:40.900]
Because Bush ain't just getting started now

[02:53:41.600 --> 02:53:46.940]
George W. 299, a very respectable, I would say even Brock Sallie

[02:53:46.940 --> 02:53:47.780]
Second showing

[02:53:48.700 --> 02:53:52.080]
Stalin 97, 9-11 Saudi hijackers 82

[02:53:53.440 --> 02:53:56.440]
Susan Smith 46, Osama bin Laden 41

[02:53:56.440 --> 02:54:00.320]
Paul Pot 31 who don't have a pot to a kiss in now

[02:54:00.320 --> 02:54:02.420]
O.J. and Tim McVeigh of each guy

[02:54:02.420 --> 02:54:03.640]
About 30 men

[02:54:03.640 --> 02:54:05.040]
And Reheat 25

[02:54:05.040 --> 02:54:09.720]
Jeffrey Dahmer 9, Lee Harvey Oswald 9, Chuck Manson 8, Ted Bundy 8

[02:54:10.440 --> 02:54:12.220]
Joseph Mangala 6

[02:54:12.220 --> 02:54:16.260]
Jim Jones 4, John Wayne Gacy 4, Harry Truman 3

[02:54:16.260 --> 02:54:20.260]
Jack the Ripper 3, Jack Ruby 3, who's head of William Callie 2

[02:54:20.260 --> 02:54:22.040]
Dorothy Kaleve Gallant, and make a list

[02:54:22.540 --> 02:54:26.040]
Dennis Raider 2, Leopold and Leib Lob 2, Lobb

[02:54:26.980 --> 02:54:27.620]
As an ear

[02:54:29.580 --> 02:54:31.840]
Ear Lobb, oh look how he spelled Ariel Sharon

[02:54:32.520 --> 02:54:33.700]
Like a TV Ariel

[02:54:34.960 --> 02:54:38.200]
Well, when you're dead it doesn't make any difference how they spell your name

[02:54:38.200 --> 02:54:40.840]
I don't know if he's dead or alive and we get nothing

[02:54:41.520 --> 02:54:43.000]
It's one of the great mysteries of all time

[02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.640]
And with all the respect of Corrota Scott King

[02:54:46.220 --> 02:54:49.480]
This funeral, this has been going on for two solid days now

[02:54:49.480 --> 02:54:50.840]
There must be nothing else going on in the world

[02:54:50.840 --> 02:54:52.520]
You know, like those four dead soldiers in Iraq

[02:54:53.180 --> 02:54:54.660]
They sure killed a lot of good times

[02:54:54.660 --> 02:54:56.820]
They don't have to give us the kids the real bad news

[02:54:56.820 --> 02:54:57.760]
There you got it

[02:54:57.760 --> 02:54:58.200]
Yeah

[02:54:58.840 --> 02:55:00.480]
One for General Sherman Charles Whitman

[02:55:00.480 --> 02:55:02.000]
What about Walt Whitman?

[02:55:02.560 --> 02:55:07.220]
Eric Harrison Dylan Teebold, Eric Laumannindas, James Earl Ray and David Berkowitz

[02:55:07.220 --> 02:55:09.780]
Each had a single only one for the son of Sam

[02:55:09.780 --> 02:55:11.200]
Wonder where that is?

[02:55:11.440 --> 02:55:13.960]
None for Lizzie Borden with her 40 Wax

[02:55:13.960 --> 02:55:18.200]
Charles Eng, Eileen Warnos, Albert DeSalvo, the Boston Stranger

[02:55:19.200 --> 02:55:21.940]
Edgene Marshall Laffelwhite, John Muhammad

[02:55:22.640 --> 02:55:26.800]
Richard Ramirez, Richard Speck, Gary Gilmore and Sir Hans Surhan

[02:55:26.800 --> 02:55:30.520]
Who's still trying to get out of that Tacoma none, 1230

[02:55:30.520 --> 02:55:32.380]
1230, like WJNOS Palm

[02:55:33.460 --> 02:55:38.040]
1975, I was WJNOS, by the way I'm getting a call today after the show from your buddy

[02:55:38.800 --> 02:55:40.740]
My brother and bastard, the hero

[02:55:41.720 --> 02:55:45.120]
Well my 30th anniversary in the market is coming up like in 21 days

[02:55:45.120 --> 02:55:48.740]
22 whatever the hell is, it's a short month, 28 days is February and March nobody cares

[02:55:49.100 --> 02:55:52.180]
And March 1st, aren't you excited about it?

[02:55:52.460 --> 02:55:53.000]
Thrilled the death

[02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:53.680]
I'm not

[02:55:55.120 --> 02:55:55.440]
30

[02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:56.840]
30, man

[02:55:56.840 --> 02:55:59.440]
In fact that's what the headline of the story should be, not that he writes the headline

[02:55:59.440 --> 02:56:01.960]
Or that I should be telling the hero what to write about 30, man

[02:56:01.960 --> 02:56:02.700]
Wouldn't that be great headline?

[02:56:03.240 --> 02:56:06.920]
That what a son several of course hasn't discovered it because little time he took his busy getting wind and dines

[02:56:06.920 --> 02:56:07.880]
Till I'm sure on the West Coast

[02:56:07.880 --> 02:56:11.560]
And even if he weren't you don't think the son several or anything about it anymore do you?

[02:56:11.700 --> 02:56:13.240]
No, no, no how about them

[02:56:13.240 --> 02:56:19.060]
So leave it to our close personal friends, I guess Kevin Baxton is about the only person that the hero that isn't in the pocket of the people across the street

[02:56:20.160 --> 02:56:24.960]
So if he writes you know we're in a nice piece or even a not so nice piece about my 30 years on the earth so I'm fluttered

[02:56:24.960 --> 02:56:26.880]
That'll be like a little something you know, a little something something

[02:56:28.080 --> 02:56:30.580]
Which is sure more than the more assistance than we got from inside

[02:56:30.580 --> 02:56:31.820]
We don't want to have it

[02:56:31.820 --> 02:56:34.340]
But Clarence acknowledged yesterday when I forced him to do it

[02:56:35.760 --> 02:56:42.660]
Like I said Clarence if I want you to know something if I want your build and I'll be more than happy to email you to call you to leave you a massage to do something

[02:56:42.660 --> 02:56:45.240]
Don't bother me don't bug me okay?

[02:56:45.900 --> 02:56:48.560]
Even if you want to talk to me because I don't want to

[02:56:49.660 --> 02:56:51.720]
You think you've got the message?

[02:56:52.040 --> 02:56:53.960]
No, I don't want to

[02:56:54.560 --> 02:56:58.760]
Scientists tell discovery of hundreds of new species and wrote new guinea you see this story?

[02:56:59.120 --> 02:57:00.400]
No, oh this is exciting

[02:57:00.400 --> 02:57:01.660]
All right, laid out

[02:57:01.660 --> 02:57:06.400]
So if you let me forget to read that Christopher Hitchens story again tomorrow

[02:57:06.400 --> 02:57:08.480]
I won't I thought you were going to read it again today

[02:57:08.920 --> 02:57:09.360]
Tomorrow

[02:57:09.360 --> 02:57:10.060]
All right

[02:57:10.920 --> 02:57:14.140]
No, I want to take my time. I want to read a nice and slowly. I want to like

[02:57:15.220 --> 02:57:17.920]
Annunciate and elaborate and emancipate and

[02:57:19.320 --> 02:57:25.940]
Irraculate and astonishing mist shrouded lost world of previously unknown and rare animals and plants high in the mountain rainforest of new guinea

[02:57:27.940 --> 02:57:30.900]
Can we can we say that I'm not really sure we can even say that anymore

[02:57:30.900 --> 02:57:35.220]
No, we can't say how about old guinea can we say about old guinea do what?

[02:57:36.660 --> 02:57:37.060]
Oh

[02:57:37.960 --> 02:57:39.480]
I can't find that thing

[02:57:40.340 --> 02:57:46.000]
Where's that thing where he says I don't care. Oh, I say here it is where he says I don't care how many day go guinea what?

[02:57:46.300 --> 02:57:47.760]
Grispo, gumbas come out of nowhere

[02:57:48.340 --> 02:57:55.680]
Among the new species of birds frogs butterflies and palms discovered in the expedition through the pristine environment untouched by man

[02:57:55.680 --> 02:58:01.320]
Was this spectacular burlapch six-wire bird of paradise? Oh the bird of paradise

[02:58:01.320 --> 02:58:03.740]
Maybe moping over there and find paradise for real

[02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:09.340]
The scientists are the first outsiders to see it. They can only reach the remote mountain nearby helicopter

[02:58:09.340 --> 02:58:14.820]
Which they described as a kin to finding a garden of Eden most of us are looking for a garden of Eden

[02:58:14.820 --> 02:58:16.480]
They're finding your garden of Eden

[02:58:17.380 --> 02:58:19.320]
Don't eat that fruit, man

[02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:23.400]
What I just reached, Eve is reaching for it right now. I think she's going to eat it

[02:58:24.440 --> 02:58:28.780]
In a jungle camp site surrounded by giant flowers unknown plants the researchers watch rare

[02:58:28.780 --> 02:58:35.220]
Bauer birds see what we're just talking about Mike Bauer and Papa Bauer and all their mother Bauer's Johnny Bauer

[02:58:35.220 --> 02:58:39.000]
They watch rare Bauer birds perform elaborate courtship rituals

[02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:47.780]
These surrounding forest was full of strange mammals such as tree kangaroos and spiny antiders which appeared totally unafraid suggesting no previous contact with humans

[02:58:47.780 --> 02:58:53.080]
Yeah, because if they had previous comment they'd run like a contact they'd run like hell

[02:58:53.080 --> 02:58:54.560]
That's funny

[02:58:55.740 --> 02:59:00.960]
Bruce Bealer of the emerging group conservation international who led the month long expedition last November to Simmer said

[02:59:00.960 --> 02:59:03.760]
It is as close to the garden of Eden as you're going to find on earth

[02:59:03.760 --> 02:59:10.200]
We found dozens if not hundreds of new species and what is probably the most pristine ecosystem in the whole Asian Pacific region

[02:59:10.200 --> 02:59:13.740]
Oh wait till the bush people find out about that. How many days before they destroy that?

[02:59:13.760 --> 02:59:14.720]
About 30, man

[02:59:14.720 --> 02:59:18.500]
There were so many new things it was almost overwhelming. Can you believe it?

[02:59:18.540 --> 02:59:19.220]
All of these things

[02:59:19.220 --> 02:59:22.620]
And we've only scratched the surface of what's there the scientists hope to return this year

[02:59:23.160 --> 02:59:27.800]
The area about 300,000 hectares I have no idea how many acres that is the end of the hectares

[02:59:27.800 --> 02:59:31.880]
No, I think they mean acres when they say them or no no they don't mean that

[02:59:31.880 --> 02:59:32.600]
All the night

[02:59:32.600 --> 02:59:36.620]
Hectares and acres I don't think are the same. What do you mean they mean? This is in the Brit

[02:59:36.620 --> 02:59:46.540]
This is that British independent. Okay. Exactly. Well lies in the upper slopes of the phogeumountans in the Eastern most and least explored province of Western New Guinea which is part of Indonesia

[02:59:47.340 --> 02:59:54.940]
The discoveries by the team from conservation international and the Indonesian suitah sciences will enhance the island's reputation as one of the most biodiverse on earth

[02:59:54.940 --> 03:00:00.400]
The mountainous terrain has caused hundreds of distinct species to evolve often specific to small areas

[03:00:00.400 --> 03:00:02.440]
To evolve sounds like that comedy plot again

[03:00:02.440 --> 03:00:05.520]
Go tell us Jack S's and Kansas about that no

[03:00:06.280 --> 03:00:07.520]
Evolution my ass

[03:00:08.260 --> 03:00:08.780]
Wow

[03:00:09.540 --> 03:00:13.500]
And then it's got a list here. Did I I think I have sympathy to the nightmare?

[03:00:13.500 --> 03:00:15.040]
Yeah, do we have it on our website?

[03:00:16.660 --> 03:00:22.740]
Josh pretty sure to send us out this whole discovery I'm sure I did because then it's got a list of all the new things they found birds

[03:00:22.740 --> 03:00:29.820]
The red faced waddled honey eater. I got a red faced model and the breeding grounds of two birds have almost mythical status

[03:00:29.820 --> 03:00:35.160]
They go in front of our bird and burlipsha six wire bird are paradise long to believe the disappeared

[03:00:36.160 --> 03:00:41.320]
40 species of males, mammals including six species of free kangaroos

[03:00:41.320 --> 03:00:44.160]
The rare and almost unknown long-veaked

[03:00:44.740 --> 03:00:47.000]
Akitna or Spiny antider

[03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:53.520]
Okay, wow all kinds of plants butterflies frogs

[03:00:53.520 --> 03:00:56.000]
I don't forget Jack Martana three

[03:00:56.000 --> 03:00:58.520]
This is Neil Rogers

[03:00:59.160 --> 03:01:02.580]
This is 5.62.8

[03:01:04.340 --> 03:01:07.720]
You do not belong here damn craggy it go smoke your crack, please

[03:01:09.160 --> 03:01:13.060]
Yes, you've heard about the place of Jesus on a piece of toast

[03:01:13.060 --> 03:01:16.600]
The place on a bagel even on a potato chip

[03:01:16.600 --> 03:01:22.020]
Now you can eat like the kegakangs with a new god of pockets

[03:01:22.020 --> 03:01:29.200]
A little round taste treats with a plaky crusts and the place of god or maybe with an else in owner

[03:01:29.200 --> 03:01:35.600]
Just lay your hands on the vent pop them into toe-dove and in just minutes they are hunt as hand

[03:01:36.760 --> 03:01:38.780]
You can have them for breakfast

[03:01:38.780 --> 03:01:42.960]
Yes, hasn't for communion or a habbitly midnight snack

[03:01:42.960 --> 03:01:48.200]
Also available in kosher when you smell the burning bush you know they're ready

[03:01:48.200 --> 03:01:52.240]
Go on the pockets from the makers of Mohammed Bites

[03:01:52.240 --> 03:01:56.060]
Right next to the pie, I love mode in the freezer section

[03:01:56.060 --> 03:02:01.020]
Tell me 146.14 go to their tent Kennedy also this funeral is going on forever

[03:02:01.020 --> 03:02:05.080]
I'm going to be a bit of a bit of a bit about he should attended plenty of those

[03:02:06.920 --> 03:02:07.640]
Yeah, yeah

[03:02:07.640 --> 03:02:16.340]
In fact right in the middle of this eulogy what he ought to do is just throw the script away and start writing and screaming about the an Nazis have taken over the country and stolen two elections

[03:02:16.340 --> 03:02:18.260]
How fast is he going to be off the air?

[03:02:18.880 --> 03:02:20.960]
Remember when they came in there and dragged Howard Beale off the set?

[03:02:21.880 --> 03:02:22.240]
Right

[03:02:22.240 --> 03:02:26.100]
Now let's see how old a 2035 is what?

[03:02:26.760 --> 03:02:27.960]
How many years from now?

[03:02:28.160 --> 03:02:29.160]
About 30, man

[03:02:29.160 --> 03:02:31.860]
29 years from now now I'm going to be a push of daisies

[03:02:31.860 --> 03:02:34.500]
And George you'll be around maybe

[03:02:35.200 --> 03:02:35.640]
possible

[03:02:36.380 --> 03:02:40.640]
John will definitely be around unless he keeps eating all that bad stuff

[03:02:40.640 --> 03:02:44.180]
Come on, get some undervenues for you

[03:02:44.180 --> 03:02:48.960]
A Russian astronomers predicted the earth will experience a mini ice age in the middle of the century

[03:02:48.960 --> 03:02:50.720]
caused by low solar activity

[03:02:50.720 --> 03:02:53.260]
In fact, he hear a voice from the sun that's saying

[03:02:53.260 --> 03:02:54.800]
I'm dying over here

[03:02:54.800 --> 03:03:00.080]
Kabiu-Bulow-Azumatov of the pole-Torbo-Azumatov

[03:03:00.080 --> 03:03:01.200]
Well, who is some Russian guy?

[03:03:01.820 --> 03:03:03.980]
In St. Petersburg that's not Florida, that's Russia

[03:03:03.980 --> 03:03:07.360]
Said yesterday that temperatures will begin falling six or seven years from now

[03:03:07.360 --> 03:03:11.800]
When global warming caused by increased solar activity in the 20th century reaches its peak

[03:03:12.880 --> 03:03:17.000]
The coldest period will occur 15 to 20 years after a major solar output decline

[03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:19.560]
between 2035 and 2045

[03:03:19.560 --> 03:03:23.280]
Why see? Well, I might really be sure if it means it's 15 to 20 years after that?

[03:03:23.360 --> 03:03:23.800]
Yeah, I guess

[03:03:23.800 --> 03:03:25.180]
See, might be safe

[03:03:25.180 --> 03:03:25.860]
2050?

[03:03:27.260 --> 03:03:28.720]
That's 44 years away

[03:03:28.720 --> 03:03:30.140]
Josh will probably be around

[03:03:31.220 --> 03:03:31.660]
Yeah?

[03:03:31.780 --> 03:03:32.540]
Be an old man

[03:03:32.540 --> 03:03:35.980]
Unless he winds up over the back case of some of that sexually transmitted

[03:03:35.980 --> 03:03:39.300]
The dramatic changes in the earth's surface temperatures are an ordinary phenomenon

[03:03:39.300 --> 03:03:40.440]
Not an anomaly, he said

[03:03:40.440 --> 03:03:44.040]
And result from variations in the sun's energy output and ultraviolet radiation

[03:03:44.040 --> 03:03:49.340]
The northern hemisphere is most recent cooled on period occurred between 1645 and 1705

[03:03:49.340 --> 03:03:54.120]
The resulting period known as the little ice age left canals in the Netherlands frozen solid

[03:03:54.120 --> 03:03:57.380]
And forced people in Greenland to abandon their houses to glaciers

[03:03:57.380 --> 03:03:58.340]
They're like that

[03:03:59.040 --> 03:04:01.360]
So those canals in Netherlands will be frozen solid brown

[03:04:02.100 --> 03:04:03.400]
Heck of a job, Brownie

[03:04:03.900 --> 03:04:07.480]
So that means they're going to have to smoke all that much more dope just to stay warm over there

[03:04:07.480 --> 03:04:09.760]
And the coffee house is on fire as of it

[03:04:10.540 --> 03:04:12.880]
Well, they can roll them up in them Danish newspapers

[03:04:14.920 --> 03:04:15.280]
56670560

[03:04:15.280 --> 03:04:18.860]
Town, let's get some more movies for this show. Oh, you know, we're not going on till tonight

[03:04:18.860 --> 03:04:23.420]
So tomorrow I have plenty of time to add more other than Godfather a movie you could watch as it in times

[03:04:24.540 --> 03:04:25.140]
Got it?

[03:04:25.480 --> 03:04:25.880]
Got it

[03:04:27.100 --> 03:04:27.760]
WQAM, hello

[03:04:29.180 --> 03:04:30.980]
Okay, well, they're thinking about it

[03:04:31.460 --> 03:04:32.120]
WQAM, hello

[03:04:32.680 --> 03:04:33.700]
And they're thinking about it

[03:04:33.700 --> 03:04:35.340]
So it's my bag because I've been blah blah blah blah

[03:04:35.340 --> 03:04:37.460]
How come those lines are still ringing? You see what I'm saying?

[03:04:38.200 --> 03:04:39.120]
They're just played with this

[03:04:39.120 --> 03:04:39.860]
Who on the usual?

[03:04:41.440 --> 03:04:41.800]
56670560

[03:04:43.740 --> 03:04:44.460]
Town 5665605

[03:04:44.460 --> 03:04:44.940]
It's a popular line

[03:04:44.940 --> 03:04:46.960]
It would be a shame if we ran out of here at two o'clock

[03:04:46.960 --> 03:04:49.360]
And your very favorite was on the list when that would be bad

[03:04:49.860 --> 03:04:50.680]
That would be a shame

[03:04:50.680 --> 03:04:52.020]
I mean, do you guys give us one or not?

[03:04:53.040 --> 03:04:54.260]
I can if you like

[03:04:54.800 --> 03:04:55.580]
Well, go right in there

[03:04:55.580 --> 03:04:57.420]
No, don't see Opie Vanilla like that like that

[03:04:57.420 --> 03:04:59.400]
Thanks, say don't be vanilla just jump right in there

[03:04:59.400 --> 03:05:00.040]
Sin City

[03:05:00.700 --> 03:05:01.420]
Sin City

[03:05:01.420 --> 03:05:02.340]
Never seen it

[03:05:03.060 --> 03:05:03.960]
You wouldn't like it

[03:05:03.960 --> 03:05:04.720]
No, you wouldn't

[03:05:04.720 --> 03:05:05.880]
I would like it?

[03:05:06.060 --> 03:05:06.620]
No, you wouldn't

[03:05:06.620 --> 03:05:09.020]
No, I would not like it. Why is that too much violence?

[03:05:09.020 --> 03:05:11.820]
Well, I could name any one of the stars that are in it

[03:05:11.820 --> 03:05:14.140]
Oh, okay running, I'll take your word for it

[03:05:14.140 --> 03:05:15.860]
Stephanie, Stephanie, come on

[03:05:15.860 --> 03:05:16.180]
Stephanie, come on

[03:05:16.180 --> 03:05:16.520]
Hello

[03:05:17.420 --> 03:05:17.900]
Yes

[03:05:18.420 --> 03:05:20.100]
I wanted to talk to Neil Rogers

[03:05:20.100 --> 03:05:21.240]
You're speaking to him

[03:05:21.740 --> 03:05:24.960]
I just want to tell you how I enjoy your show

[03:05:24.960 --> 03:05:26.920]
I've listened for many years

[03:05:26.920 --> 03:05:29.580]
You start my day off with a laugh

[03:05:29.580 --> 03:05:30.980]
I love your sense of humor

[03:05:30.980 --> 03:05:33.880]
And when you're serious

[03:05:33.880 --> 03:05:36.600]
You are right on the target

[03:05:36.600 --> 03:05:37.720]
That's what I always tell him

[03:05:37.720 --> 03:05:38.420]
Well, thank you very much

[03:05:38.420 --> 03:05:39.740]
And I just wanted to tell you that

[03:05:39.740 --> 03:05:42.320]
Because I've been trying to call you for a long, long time

[03:05:42.840 --> 03:05:44.280]
And I'm glad I got you today

[03:05:44.280 --> 03:05:45.140]
Better late than ever

[03:05:45.140 --> 03:05:45.760]
Thanks a lot, sweetheart

[03:05:45.760 --> 03:05:46.980]
Okay, thank you

[03:05:46.980 --> 03:05:47.980]
I see there's a nice lady

[03:05:47.980 --> 03:05:49.560]
How do you like that? We had a lady

[03:05:49.560 --> 03:05:51.360]
She was so nice, that's great

[03:05:51.360 --> 03:05:52.400]
She was nice

[03:05:52.400 --> 03:05:54.160]
She was nice, she really met it

[03:05:54.160 --> 03:05:56.560]
I mean, you know, our near later on like that kissy kissy stuff

[03:05:56.560 --> 03:05:57.280]
That was this way

[03:05:57.280 --> 03:05:58.560]
You know, that was a lot of things

[03:05:58.560 --> 03:06:00.160]
You know, it's kissy kissy because then they're like

[03:06:00.160 --> 03:06:00.680]
Yeah

[03:06:01.660 --> 03:06:02.520]
You know what I'm saying?

[03:06:02.660 --> 03:06:02.880]
I did

[03:06:02.880 --> 03:06:04.180]
Not good for their image

[03:06:04.660 --> 03:06:05.800]
W-A-M, hello

[03:06:06.560 --> 03:06:07.980]
How about get shorty

[03:06:08.640 --> 03:06:09.800]
How about it?

[03:06:09.880 --> 03:06:11.160]
Or if you want it twice?

[03:06:12.700 --> 03:06:14.380]
I ain't never seen it first time, so I don't know

[03:06:14.380 --> 03:06:15.340]
Would you watch it twice?

[03:06:15.880 --> 03:06:17.160]
Yeah, it's really good

[03:06:17.160 --> 03:06:17.560]
Okay

[03:06:17.560 --> 03:06:19.160]
Remember that sound like it?

[03:06:19.320 --> 03:06:20.420]
That's W-A-M, hello

[03:06:21.360 --> 03:06:26.580]
Hey, may I be the first to congratulate you for 30 years of being on the radio?

[03:06:26.960 --> 03:06:28.680]
Thank you so much

[03:06:28.680 --> 03:06:30.020]
That's quite a milestone

[03:06:30.020 --> 03:06:32.040]
I mean, to do 30 years of anything

[03:06:32.040 --> 03:06:33.200]
Much less radio

[03:06:33.620 --> 03:06:36.120]
Especially in this town, man, this heartless, hateful town

[03:06:37.160 --> 03:06:39.560]
Well, my, my, my, my, my, my,

[03:06:39.560 --> 03:06:41.440]
In my addition to the movie thing is I don't know why

[03:06:41.440 --> 03:06:45.500]
It's so damn stupid, but every time I'm channel surfing, and it comes on

[03:06:45.500 --> 03:06:47.780]
I just have to watch it, is that the

[03:06:48.620 --> 03:06:50.620]
National Ampoule indication with Chevy Chase

[03:06:51.200 --> 03:06:51.560]
Okay

[03:06:52.620 --> 03:06:53.080]
That's right

[03:06:53.080 --> 03:06:56.440]
I would agree with you, I watched it several times on TV

[03:06:56.440 --> 03:06:59.420]
I would never go on buy it or anything, but you know, when it comes on, I watch it

[03:06:59.420 --> 03:06:59.940]
Exactly

[03:07:00.400 --> 03:07:01.300]
Okay, thanks, Sally

[03:07:01.300 --> 03:07:01.900]
Okay

[03:07:02.240 --> 03:07:05.300]
Now, there's a whole series of those, what do we, what do we, national Ampoule indication?

[03:07:05.960 --> 03:07:06.360]
What do we say?

[03:07:06.580 --> 03:07:07.420]
That's it, vacation

[03:07:07.420 --> 03:07:08.020]
Okay

[03:07:09.100 --> 03:07:11.740]
Because I know the one he's talking about is very funny, it's hysterical

[03:07:11.740 --> 03:07:13.480]
In fact, that was when Chevy Chase was funny

[03:07:14.440 --> 03:07:15.200]
Remember the last days?

[03:07:15.360 --> 03:07:16.140]
That's the one on time ago

[03:07:16.140 --> 03:07:16.580]
Yeah

[03:07:17.620 --> 03:07:18.700]
W-A-M, hello

[03:07:20.660 --> 03:07:21.640]
Q-A-M

[03:07:21.980 --> 03:07:22.700]
Neil, how are you?

[03:07:23.100 --> 03:07:23.380]
Great

[03:07:23.880 --> 03:07:25.000]
There's a couple of things

[03:07:25.560 --> 03:07:27.160]
For the movie, I don't know if you have it

[03:07:27.160 --> 03:07:29.160]
I just want to look at it and go in very, very clean rock

[03:07:30.280 --> 03:07:32.340]
Yeah, I don't know if I love it

[03:07:32.340 --> 03:07:33.600]
I wish it was that far

[03:07:34.380 --> 03:07:35.340]
Yeah, I can't

[03:07:35.340 --> 03:07:37.940]
If you can watch that, maybe not every day, but I could sure watch it a lot

[03:07:37.940 --> 03:07:40.820]
Neil, I would, I, one thing yesterday was the hearing

[03:07:40.820 --> 03:07:47.000]
Did you see the things you can use, so they can't, wouldn't swear in, and Gonzalez was a he-my-glie

[03:07:47.000 --> 03:07:49.280]
So then they would have to cross the queue to you

[03:07:49.280 --> 03:07:51.000]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, yeah

[03:07:51.000 --> 03:07:52.380]
I was busy with this

[03:07:52.380 --> 03:07:56.840]
Yeah, a lot of the mobsters are going to start taking the same, same, same cramp

[03:07:56.840 --> 03:08:00.040]
It is incredible, Neil, I don't know how to question, now maybe you'd like to answer

[03:08:00.540 --> 03:08:04.080]
There is, my brother just got a quarterback like you do, and I know he's on those cars

[03:08:04.080 --> 03:08:08.280]
But what I understand is, what are the things you can afford them? Why do you buy two?

[03:08:09.540 --> 03:08:10.520]
Always good to have a spare

[03:08:10.960 --> 03:08:12.680]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, okay

[03:08:12.680 --> 03:08:15.100]
There are a lot of things in life like that

[03:08:15.100 --> 03:08:17.440]
Always good to have a spare just in case the first one cramps out

[03:08:17.440 --> 03:08:18.500]
Or the other stuff

[03:08:18.500 --> 03:08:19.580]
I feel you know, I love it

[03:08:19.580 --> 03:08:20.420]
Thanks, Bill, okay

[03:08:20.420 --> 03:08:23.500]
Thank you very much, I've been listening to you for eight years, you were just great

[03:08:23.500 --> 03:08:24.700]
Yes, I am, thanks, Bill

[03:08:24.700 --> 03:08:25.580]
Thank you

[03:08:26.060 --> 03:08:31.520]
Okay, but they're sure, Kissy Kissy, they're which is great, we like that between now and the first and the first and the second of March you go,

[03:08:31.660 --> 03:08:34.120]
I like that, yeah, or you can do it anyway

[03:08:34.120 --> 03:08:35.320]
Ted Kennedy says

[03:08:36.580 --> 03:08:37.220]
Together again

[03:08:37.540 --> 03:08:38.700]
There you go, all right

[03:08:39.140 --> 03:08:42.060]
Together again, sounds like the supreme, so somebody will be together again

[03:08:42.600 --> 03:08:46.560]
The supreme, oh, speaking of the supreme, how's that, the Nazi Sam I leader doing?

[03:08:47.620 --> 03:08:52.920]
We got 1261 votes on a pool that they were going to be close to 1300 today

[03:08:52.920 --> 03:08:56.240]
Without even a whimper, without saying like, aren't you shocked?

[03:08:57.280 --> 03:09:00.220]
Yeah, I bet you're down town Allen Brown is foaming at them off

[03:09:00.220 --> 03:09:01.000]
And you want to know why?

[03:09:01.120 --> 03:09:03.180]
Because the handwritten, even Daniel can read it

[03:09:03.180 --> 03:09:04.680]
The handwriting is on the wall

[03:09:04.680 --> 03:09:05.740]
Remember Daniel?

[03:09:06.440 --> 03:09:07.120]
And the line's done

[03:09:08.140 --> 03:09:09.600]
Don't you remember the handwriting on the wall?

[03:09:10.080 --> 03:09:11.440]
Yeah, that was the only thing that I was going to do

[03:09:11.920 --> 03:09:13.940]
And Jonah was in hell of a whale

[03:09:15.080 --> 03:09:18.160]
All these fairy tales, all these bubble-myses, all the silliness

[03:09:18.160 --> 03:09:20.580]
And in the beginning, God said, let there be light

[03:09:20.580 --> 03:09:24.440]
And let there be light, and let there be a tiny source, all this other crap

[03:09:24.440 --> 03:09:26.280]
Well, I stand in innovation for Ted Kennedy

[03:09:26.280 --> 03:09:29.620]
There you go, you go, Ted, and so what if that bitch drowned? Who cares?

[03:09:29.800 --> 03:09:31.360]
Where did you learn your trade, you idiot?

[03:09:31.820 --> 03:09:35.340]
Whoever told you that you could work with men? What's your hired for?

[03:09:35.920 --> 03:09:38.620]
Is to help us? Does that seem clear to you?

[03:09:38.960 --> 03:09:42.700]
To help us? To help men who are going out there?

[03:09:42.960 --> 03:09:44.660]
To try to earn a living?

[03:09:45.160 --> 03:09:47.100]
Your company man? You're fairy

[03:09:47.100 --> 03:09:49.720]
This is Neil Rogers

[03:09:50.520 --> 03:09:53.740]
This is 5162A.

[03:09:56.040 --> 03:09:58.880]
The longest read joins on his day of rock dance

[03:09:58.880 --> 03:10:00.400]
A nice song, Clarence, you idiot

[03:10:01.980 --> 03:10:05.440]
So it problems us to court as if it go like 5 seconds over

[03:10:05.440 --> 03:10:06.960]
10, 15

[03:10:06.960 --> 03:10:10.340]
I was sleeping in the park

[03:10:10.340 --> 03:10:13.400]
Just trying to take a scene

[03:10:13.400 --> 03:10:17.000]
You're fairy, knock a bubble in the dark

[03:10:17.000 --> 03:10:20.260]
It left me black and blue

[03:10:20.260 --> 03:10:26.780]
I'm hurt so bad I'm coughing up blood

[03:10:27.400 --> 03:10:33.420]
Why was I beaten by teenagers with clothes?

[03:10:33.580 --> 03:10:34.680]
I'm dying of hair

[03:10:34.680 --> 03:10:40.860]
Why this happened? I took the clothes to the head

[03:10:40.860 --> 03:10:43.760]
They took off, they were laughing

[03:10:44.860 --> 03:10:46.960]
They left me here for dead

[03:10:47.860 --> 03:10:53.340]
I've got an ass, but they high on drugs

[03:10:54.860 --> 03:11:00.360]
Why was I beaten by teenagers with clothes?

[03:11:01.200 --> 03:11:03.240]
I'm lying here

[03:11:03.860 --> 03:11:07.300]
Can't hardly move

[03:11:08.300 --> 03:11:13.120]
They took those baseball bats and swung them like they grew

[03:11:14.100 --> 03:11:17.240]
Why to ask the parents why?

[03:11:18.260 --> 03:11:20.620]
They raised their kids this way

[03:11:21.300 --> 03:11:24.460]
Lots and lots of prison time

[03:11:24.460 --> 03:11:27.360]
They'll be the price they pay

[03:11:28.300 --> 03:11:33.440]
Put them in jail with all those other dust

[03:11:34.440 --> 03:11:40.340]
