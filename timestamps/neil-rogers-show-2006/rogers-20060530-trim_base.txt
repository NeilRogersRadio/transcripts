America the people who watch the news even the young people which are none of

[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.920]
them what said news anyway but assuming that they did they watch their news from

[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.880]
an older person someone they can trust they don't realize that we're

[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.500]
Walter Krontite went on here he was a young guy people like Ralph Redneck people

[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.920]
watched him for 30 years on here he didn't start out as a daughtering old fart

[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.120]
you know just like us when we went on here we didn't start out as 80-year-old

[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.920]
old fart so with a walker in a colostomy bag right right and people grow up with

[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.060]
him and he stick with it because people like consistency which this day

[00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.580]
they trust you that's right they like Krontite hotly and prickly they start out

[00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.880]
they were young guys and people watched him for 20 years and then we would

[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.480]
news people build a trust for right and then they're talking about Bob Sheeper

[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.900]
while CBS's numbers are what are they talking about man have you ever watched

[00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.920]
him my god he's got I think he's got Andy Rooney's eyebrows grown out of his

[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.640]
hair out of his ears man well talk about an old toad people don't want to watch

[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.880]
grandpa fumbling his way through the news and to say a hokey okey dokey things

[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.740]
on here nobody wants to see that but nevertheless I'm gonna stick with the

[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.860]
Brian Williams even though I can't stand looking at him he's bizarre it's got

[00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.600]
like two sets of bottom teeth in his head is like he look he looks like he was in

[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.420]
that movie the what the hell is that movie about the spaceship landing oh so

[00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.040]
many of them yeah it's something of a third kind or whatever yeah no they

[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.720]
close encounters no that was that movie with that Richard dry face that was about

[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.240]
spaceship landing the I know can't stand him either go back in the yard and

[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.820]
keep digging Richard and dig a deep hole and jump into it so if I was to make up a

[00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.040]
list of people I don't want to hear about any more Ricky would be right there

[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.180]
really who cares well here'll be back though he'll be back at the I don't care

[00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.900]
only here for one year you know it could as if there was any doubt the Canadian

[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.260]
football league is a joke the fact that they don't recognize they don't respect

[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.460]
the the rules of the NFL players that are barred or suspended they don't

[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.840]
recognize that so they can play the CFL it's a joke it makes a mockery of it so

[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.280]
you can have the worst slime ball in the world and as long as they can

[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.060]
hopefully draw a few extra asses in the seats that's what they'll do and by

[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.540]
the way speaking of asses in the seats they announced 7,683 yesterday for the

[00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:30.160]
Giants at PP Park Norma can't call me from the ballpark and you he said there

[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.220]
were more people in the right field stands than were behind home plane there

[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.640]
were like 3,000 people there there was a lot yeah I was there and the fact is

[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.100]
that he had some nerve to hit that home run on Sunday so it took whatever

[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.900]
significance there might have been about him being in town away so who cared you

[00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.680]
know I thought it was great good nice going very you jackass now I like him

[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.800]
just for that boy you I'm telling you that David Samson's got a good point man

[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.220]
you're responsible for the fact that failure of this franchise yeah right not

[00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.460]
the fact they got a bunch of little leaders out there has nothing to do with

[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:07.100]
David's your fault yeah Hank destroyed I can just see the headline now Hank

[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.280]
chases Marlon Zadamani that'll be the headliner buries column yeah I cut the

[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.400]
payroll down to 14 million well pass over where they're going today they leave

[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.640]

[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:56.840]
Princeton really I got a Richie Hebner home run against and you know you know who

[00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:01.620]
the right fielder was for the Giants that day very bomb Bob Bobby bonds now

[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:07.080]
there was a player Bobby bonds he was in right field I believe so and you know

[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.620]
they showed the picture of Barry Bond the stuff Bobby bonds played center but

[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:13.440]
well whatever the hell wherever he was maybe was in right center field of

[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.880]
home run but anyway they showed the picture of Barry when he was with the pirates

[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.600]
in Toronto starting to wait about 150 pounds and he was like a scrawny kid he was

[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.640]
like skinny I just can't imagine how it maybe he just ate a lot of pasta or

[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:30.340]
something in fact it said Ricky Williams was easy eating pasta and I forgot I

[00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:33.320]
threw that article away that it just was reading you pasta and some kind of

[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:39.260]
beans he doesn't get the test it up there either but the NFL will still test them

[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:43.560]
yeah ten times a month that would be out of a system by the time he gets back

[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.940]
down there one up ten times a month he still has to go for test oh why does he

[00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:51.220]
really yeah ten times a month it's once every three days whatever if my math is

[00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:55.680]
correct boy how's he gonna avoid that what could read up here boy boy you can

[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.920]
smell it on the street corners here well I think I smell some right now

[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:06.680]
no that's bad at the little of contact highs yeah well he's gonna be busy

[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:10.820]

[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.300]
Charlie good God all on the bandwagon man it's what they wait for is what what

[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:39.140]
bandwagon can we jump on this week they're hungry for a championship here oh

[00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:44.200]
yeah and I'm gonna tell you front running phonies in fact they had not the last

[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:49.000]
game but the game before that in Carolina they had chunks of empty seats that

[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.180]
that's your front running phonies in Raleigh North Carolina those people would

[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:56.300]
know a hockey puck from their ass and then all of a sudden we love the hurricane

[00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:00.200]
yeah all out of the crap what a phony bunch of balloon and when they show the

[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:04.700]
crowd there in North Carolina man those people you talk about mugwomps they

[00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:10.240]
look like distant presence of the banjo boys the beeslies wow strange you ever

[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:15.160]
see them people in the Joe Bells from Joe Bells from where he worked in Raleigh

[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:19.400]
yeah well figures I thought that was Chris Jones it worked in Raleigh and two both

[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.120]
oh they worked together there so in other words he brought his buddy down there

[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:27.620]
with him that's what it's all about I see that's what people in well everywhere

[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.640]
in every business that's what they tend to do they comfort zone you know they

[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.860]
bring their own little personal mafia along with them hey it's like

[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:38.680]
Facebook managers yeah they bring their whole sport hockey the same thing

[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.860]
so bring all their buddies with them no one to get canned and they all pretty

[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:45.900]
much get canned at the same time right but there's a reason for any know what I

[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:50.600]
survive I think the reason in business is the same as it is in sports yeah they

[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.040]
want somebody to watch their back is that what it is yeah or is it just

[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.840]
insecurity the fact that they realize that they're inept and incompetent

[00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:01.600]

[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.620]
the managers job and Cleveland they would not allow him to hire his own coach

[00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.640]
or his own coaches well they throw they were free to bring a bunch of black

[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.620]
folks in there well he wanted one guy just so he just wanted to hire one coach

[00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:16.860]

lead singer on most of those songs were you worth that I'm sure you say it well

[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:43.420]

[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:47.400]
came along solid and let you guys out a couple hours early that's only reason we agreed to

[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.680]
it and your general manager by the way had no idea that that was going on yesterday

[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:53.800]
that's how out of touch he is he's worried about important things like

[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.680]
Clarence's wardrobe things like that what is the measure of man you asked

[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:03.260]

[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:11.980]
show and on a holiday I'm not knocking the number of votes I just when we give the

[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:16.580]
result we always give the number okay put it in perspective now we have 589

[00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:20.900]
today and of course all we started this one last night so I got a not that early

[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:25.780]
though I think about 10 590 590 I thought it was 560 well we're all over the

[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:31.020]
place some days we splatter some days were like 540 540 we're all around that's

[00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:34.260]
what we have to do to start over modulating pump out about 100,000 watts like

[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:40.800]
what's the measure of man how honorable he is 404 well that's craft yeah that

[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:44.540]
was an out I thought I put that on like at the end I'm a much here right away and

[00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:49.320]
that's because they're most of the audiences dishonorable may lie right I hate this

[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:54.200]
pull lady for how much money he makes 31 that's a good choice mm-hmm how long

[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:58.460]

[00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:02.600]
you when you hold your parts in too long you want up dying that's right like

[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:06.320]
Morris Gibb so I think we have a suit choice just based on that she's

[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:09.180]

[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:27.960]

[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:33.080]
all the time. Some of it might get away from our family. Just a single crap. I mean, who

[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:38.240]
now wants to hear the same stuff 24-7, you know, over and over. It'll be one thing if it was really

[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:42.560]
funny and entertaining the first time, you know, and at Series Next M stuff, how are they doing?

[00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:48.520]
Really good? No. No. In the tank, in the toilet, just like Herbie. 625 votes on the pool today.

[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:56.580]
What's your take on Barry Barnes? But at your risk time, Lee, isn't it? I bet you know what

[00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:02.360]
did you vote for that? I did, yeah. Yeah, idiot. What's your take on Barry Barnes? Without Roy, it's just

[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:07.480]
another joke that's all he is 182. That's leading the way. He couldn't lick the babe's jock,

[00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:13.600]
116, and that was my vote. Babe Ruth, my ass. His stats are bogus one-away. See, a lot of these are

[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:18.220]
true. He's good, not great 54. And like the Humper, and I pointed out when he was with the Pirates,

[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:22.300]
he was a string bean. He weighed 150 pounds. And all of a sudden, he like blew up like somebody put

[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:26.440]
that old bicycle pump deep inside his recto, a little up like a balloon. Couldn't have been those

[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:33.140]
Royads could it. I hate baseball 52. He's the greatest 46 quizzlings like Josh,

[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:37.220]
punks who haven't been around long enough to see great ball players. Guys who didn't see Mickey

[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:42.880]
Maddler, Willie Mays, or really great ball players play. I hate him, Roger Merris. I hate him 35. I

[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:47.840]
hate this pool 33. 628 votes. And he liked that. We got 620. And I think we might make that

[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:51.740]
thousand again today. What do you think? You know it's right after a holiday weekend. Wouldn't that be a

[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:56.300]
real feather in our craft? That'd be something. So anyway, I made that call on Friday to Joe

[00:29:56.300 --> 00:30:00.840]
Bell for about 45-50 minutes. I will not be making that mistake again. I couldn't remember my dogs.

[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:05.900]
I remember your dogs, both of them. I could have talked to them and had a more productive. In

[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:09.380]
fact, I wish tell they were still around because I would come right down there and talk to them for

[00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:14.560]
45-50 minutes and then put them back in the urn or something. A more productive time. Just like

[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:21.600]
farting into a cyclone, just ridiculous. A rack violence thing 50 lives. Let's get that stuff out

[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:25.420]
of the way real fast, although there's not a lot of it. At least 50 people by the idea, I think it

[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:30.440]
was 51. In a series of bombings and ambushes in Iraq, among the dead were two members of a CBS

[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:34.960]
news crew were killed with a bomb rip through the US military convoy and sent for Baghdad. One US

[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:39.860]
soldier and Iraqi translator also died in that attack. CBS correspondent Kimberly Dozier was

[00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:43.480]
seriously injured, but I see their sentence more and she'll be okay. My question is, what are

[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:49.200]
these people doing there? Oh, they're brave and heroic. Is that what it is? What are they doing there?

[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:53.560]
Making money for the network that they work for. In addition, well, we don't see you very much

[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.740]
live stuff from there, considering they got the satellites there and they got all these

[00:30:56.740 --> 00:31:02.060]
correspondence there in Yadiani. We see very little of the murder and bloodshed. We see a

[00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:06.760]
couple of quick clips here and there and then it comes out of your files. There you go. That's

[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:10.560]
very well put. We see only what you're supposed to see and probably more than they want.

[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:17.720]
Anyway, we got... Oh, and look at this. Boych planted fake news stories on American TV. You can't believe

[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:23.060]
that, can you? No, I don't. Federal authorities are actively investigating dozens of American

[00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:28.080]
television stations for broadcasting items produced by the Bush administration and by major

[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:32.960]
corporations and passing them off as normal news. Some of the fake news statements talked of

[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:37.760]
success in the war in Iraq and promoted with companies' products. Investigators from the FCC are

[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.980]
seeking... That's what you ought to be doing at the FCC instead of worried about who's saying

[00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:45.400]
crap on the air and who's saying, me or you're on the Spanish language stations, you ought to be

[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:50.940]
worrying more about what this kind of stuff. Sickening information about stations across the country after

[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:55.480]
you're produced by a campaign group detailed, the extraordinary instead of these as such items.

[00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:01.480]
Brainwashing, man. Hitler would be very proud. And I keep thinking back to that horrible thing

[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:07.040]
last year that annual fart fest, that joke fest that they have, everything's a big joke.

[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:11.420]
You know, the one at Steven Colbert, where I got all the headlines about this year.

[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:16.320]
Did they press dinner? The White House correspondent. Right. Press sucked fest.

[00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:19.460]
Right, that's right. Where they all sit around. Oh, we're so sorry.

[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:22.680]
Just like they do at Rumsfeld's for a news conference, this is the same thing.

[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.740]
Like everything's a big joke. And Bush did that thing about, oh no, no weapons over here,

[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:30.640]
no weapons over there, and all these all these parents and wives and kids and families,

[00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:35.020]
of all on friends of all these soldiers who were either dead or came back like with body parts

[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:38.740]
missing. I wonder how funny they thought it was. I keep thinking about that and it just

[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:42.840]
infuriates the living crap out of me. In fact, speaking of crap, I could have spent that 45,

[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:47.180]
50 minutes on Friday on the throne and had a much more productive and healthful experience

[00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:51.900]
than talk of your leader, man, your fearless leader. You are listened to the wrong people in that

[00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:57.120]
building, Mr. Bell. You got no clue. You have been there for six months and you haven't got a clue

[00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:01.500]
what's going on in that joint. And you think I give a crap about whether the water Nazis last

[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:07.220]
day is today. How the hell does she impact my life or Georgia's life or Josh Cordis's life?

[00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:12.060]
How much impact does she have on you guys' lives? Not? Josh? Not too much.

[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.880]
Do it even see her other than when she's lurking out in the hallway with her ear to the door?

[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:22.460]
Well, which makes changes on the log. Yeah. Don't mess with my log. Who cares? I think we

[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:26.880]
ought to ask you an option or ask off on eBay. The report by the non-profit group center for

[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:31.820]
media and democracy found that over a 10-month period, at least 77 television stations were making

[00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:38.220]
use of the fake news broadcast known as VNR's video news releases. No one, not one of them,

[00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:42.140]
told viewers who had produced the items. Not a single one of their stations. We know we only had

[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:53.660]
partial access to these VNR's yet we found 77 stations using them said Diana Farseta, one of the

[00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:57.560]
groups researchers. I would say it's pretty extraordinary. The picture we found was much worse than

[00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:01.640]
expected going into the investigation and just how widely these could play out frequently these

[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:07.360]
pre-packaged segments are put on the ear. Look at news you get propaganda just like in Nazi Germany,

[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:14.980]
man, just like in the Soviet Union. They'd be really proud. Let's see what does this say? Subject,

[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:20.680]
it's a facts. WQAM and the jumbo tron of the heat game last night. This is from KPM Coral

[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:25.860]
Gables. It says seen on the center court jumbo tron display and the ribbon tron, the long and

[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:31.840]
narrow-cover display that circles India. We know it is 560 WQAM weekdays, Hank Goldberg 7-10A

[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:36.100]
in German score to 7PM. Not no mention of anyone else or anything else. Well, what do you expect?

[00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:39.880]
At the heat game, this is in the sports show. You think any of those people listen to this show?

[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.540]
No. Other than Pat Riley nobody. And now it's a sure but they won't.

[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:48.800]
Well, and that's for damn sure. Why would they want to give me any publicity at the heat game?

[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:54.040]
I mean, I don't want any part of that crap. PS, it says, did you catch Rock and Wool and Vaders,

[00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:58.620]
the AM radio DJs on Discovery Times, Anteloy did not. Excellent documentary at the beginning on

[00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:03.640]
Rock on the radio. Well, I'll be sure and take a peek at that. I'll be scouring for it. I like that kind

[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:09.740]
of stuff. Just like I like that Alan Fried thing. 647 votes on the pool and most of the people say

[00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:13.400]
are very sucks. That's basically, you know, the sum it up when I go through the whole thing.

[00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:19.220]
That's the bottom line. Except people like Josh who just don't understand what great baseball players

[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:23.400]
are all about. During the year before we had 400 teams or people like you who don't understand

[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:27.980]
what he's done. I don't really care what he's done. Okay, because it's all tainted. It's all tainted.

[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:32.460]
Just like Mark McWire was tainted and just like Sammy so so was tainted. And all these other

[00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:37.400]
guys, a lot of us underhidden like 4000 home runs a year. Wow. In fact, I'm going to call up the

[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:41.480]
Haitian Embassy. I'm going to complain about the Minding of those damn baseballs too tight like

[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:46.360]
golf balls 1042 at 560. But you're going to of course out and care about baseball anyway. So what

[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:50.300]
am I getting all whipped up about? Do I watch baseball? Do I care about it? Do I go to a Blue Jays

[00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:56.100]
game? Not on a bet. Not if you paid me by the pitch. No chance. Oh my god. Talk about coma

[00:35:56.100 --> 00:36:00.560]
inducing even more coma inducing than the Stugatio. I wonder if for Clarence is still looking

[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:05.560]
at the Stugatio. I think so. I'll go out. That would have been a good point to fire his ass.

[00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:09.560]
You know, the summer season is fast approaching and that means it must be close to Father's Day.

[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:14.660]
In fact, Father's Day is coming up on Sunday June 18th. That's what is it? Less than a

[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:19.380]
month, a couple weeks away. We all know what to add like to do on their big day. Eat. It's time

[00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:22.920]
to call the melting pot. Make your reservations for Father's Day. Well, what a treat this will

[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:26.940]
be for Dad. The melting pot is a fondue restaurant. In addition to their famous cheese and chocolates,

[00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:31.700]
they serve up some serious meats and fish for hungry dads like yours. You're a dad hungry?

[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:37.560]
Okay. Or mine? Hardy entourage from a center cut filet minuanda black and trim from teriyaki,

[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:42.160]
sirloin, pork lobster and lots more. The melting pot definitely serves serious food for

[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:46.500]
serious appetites and if you ever serious dad, which I did not, believe me, who loved the melting

[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:50.740]
pot. Take it from me. Nobody leaves the pot hungry. They haven't award-winning mindless to boot.

[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:54.760]
And don't forget the melting pot's famous desserts to guarantee to put it be small on dad's

[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:58.460]
course. So might that call today invite dad to different something different and delicious,

[00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:03.360]
a real treat at the melting pot restaurant near you. A full four-course gift for Dad right from

[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:08.520]
you. And be sure and tell him that cranky old meal sent your box. This is a meal of all

[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:17.440]
here sent to the five. This is 5.69 am. Case in you're on 2am. We don't have any national guards

[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:21.260]
there because they're all fighting a war in Iraq right now. Not the National Guard.

[00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:26.340]
Not the National Guard. There's no National Guard. No.

[00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:26.540]
I'll go.

[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:44.020]
Taylor is the champion. My friend. Now he'll keep on singing my crew band.

[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:47.080]
We're at 6606. It goes on to 4. I think it's an almond.

[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:57.700]
Taylor is the champion. Hicks will be touring. Second place will have a room.

[00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:04.360]
The Taylor is the champion. All by dawn.

[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:08.420]
Hey, by the way, I got one word for him. You know what it is?

[00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:14.120]
Fading. Yeah. Saw him over the weekend. You can't have hooded. Oh yeah. Oh my god. What a

[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:20.680]
10.47 and 5.60 WTQ. I am. You're fair. And speaking of 6.66, I might as well move this up to

[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:24.200]
the top of my piles because I don't think we're going to get any calls today. It's today after

[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:28.160]
the holiday. You know, people are busy putting their get sobering up putting their lives back

[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:32.820]
together again. See that's one thing about Memorial Day like the 4th of July and like Labor Day.

[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:37.340]
And is there any other ones that just excuse for outdoor barbecues and getting just absolutely

[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:42.480]
plastered right? Right. I mean, you know, the significance of them and pretty much it's been lost.

[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:48.620]
Those are especially. Do I leave anyone out? St. Patties. More just getting wasted than barbecuing,

[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:52.540]
but that's right. In other words, you tell me that the hours need me excused to get drunk.

[00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:56.800]
No, but if they do have an excuse, then they get extra drunk. Then they really go nuts.

[00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:00.920]
Says the man of the green Irish shirt in the other room there. Would the clamor always

[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:04.440]
wear a green shirt on the shirt? I'm not going to lie to you. Don't let dust you that.

[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:09.160]
And don't wear it on Thursday. Would the clamor overligious Thurlothi De Vinci code barely

[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:15.880]
fading a major Hollywood studio is mining the same vein with a Satanic 666 marketing campaign

[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:21.360]
for its new horror film. And it's I underlined the word new. Here's another movie just like the

[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:25.000]
House of Wax was that remake? I haven't watched it. It's making a rounds on my cable now.

[00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:31.100]
That'll bother. It has no stars. It doesn't have like one star half a star. It has no stars.

[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:35.680]
I don't think it has a moon either for that. Well, I'm embarrassed to say that I saw it and

[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:39.780]
it's not a good movie, but it's worth seeing just to see how Paris Hilton dies.

[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:45.780]
Oh, I'd like to see that. It's a good one in real life. But seriously, the original House of

[00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:49.640]
Wax, that's in 3D. I don't know. You probably can't get that on DVD because you have to have

[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:54.360]
those 3D glasses to watch it. Why did they do away with that? Was it just too expensive to

[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:58.960]
glasses? It comes back periodically. It's a novelty thing. And yeah, it's a it's a big logistic

[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:03.540]
pain in the ass, I guess, for the theaters to that was fun though. I agree. I remember that one

[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:07.160]
movie I think was called The Maze where they had these giant frogs jumping out of this

[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:12.340]
building. I said, man, that was scary. Yeah. That's like Frankenstein movie in 3D. And then they

[00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:18.600]
sent them all back to Montreal. Anyway, the Omen. Now the original Omen, let's see, that was the one

[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:23.420]
with Gregory Pector. What was the other one after the Omen or the Omen 2 with the, right? They had

[00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:28.540]
like three I think in total. Did they? They were. The original Omen was Gregory Pector. And what was

[00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:36.480]
who else was in it? Oh, look it up. Look it up. I want to say, I don't know. I know who it is.

[00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:40.820]
It's on the tip of my tongue. Who the name was? She's when you see you're going to be embarrassed.

[00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:45.040]
I don't think the Omen remake of the 76 horror classic is the kind of film that routinely makes

[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:49.020]
it big at the box office, appealing to the cut of demographic of young and predominantly male

[00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:56.200]
thrill figures like Josh Cortes. Did you see the original Omen? No. You never saw the Omen? I don't

[00:40:56.200 --> 00:41:00.120]
think so. Jesus, now did you get your rear window? Yes, I did. What about the movie?

[00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:06.540]
Leeremic. Leeremic by the way. Leeremic, I know it. I told you. We're sad. Did you see

[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:12.480]
your window yet? No, I haven't seen any of the DVDs. Standing in the shadows of Motown? Not yet,

[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:17.240]
very soon. Sometimes you're a liar, man. You've got like a promise pile of money. I told you,

[00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:26.180]
I'm running behind. I got to watch some of these. Yeah, but only I saw the stories on Sunday. You

[00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:29.700]
know the stories anyway. Who the hell is going to read them? In fact, just out of curiosity,

[00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:34.540]
let's see if anybody read the stories that you post it on Sunday. That's not. That's not.

[00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:38.820]
What do you mean? That's not. It'll make you feel good if somebody did. If this

[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:43.840]
dance page ever comes up again, which is for the moment, it seems to be like in Limbaugh.

[00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:47.960]
What's that all about? Don't tell me. Just when Eric fixed it this morning, we had a

[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:53.260]
little bit of a problem on here. Now it's in Limbaugh again. Geez, I can't deal with it. Let me go

[00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:58.240]
to Firefox and try that. I think you're right. I think the Omen has got something to do with

[00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:03.380]
the Internet Explorer. There's no doubt. It's Microsoft, man. That's made by the devil. That's

[00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:08.040]
VGates. He is the devil. Oh, see? On here, it comes up just fine. Right away. Now, let's see. It

[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:12.380]
would have been the 28th was Sunday, right? 200 and some people saw the Hell and Thomas on

[00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:17.160]
RoodeQuest in Fox News and Tony Snow. And we had, let's see, huh? And we're going to have

[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:21.060]
several others. They're going to have 100 and more reads on Sunday in the middle of Memorial Day,

[00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:24.900]
Holy Weekend. I wouldn't feel too shabby about that. Mr. was wrong with that. That's right.

[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:29.660]
And it probably would have had like 400 reads if you'd put it on there. Well, before everybody was

[00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:33.740]
half asleep, they're already in the bag by the time you put it on there. But don't feel bad about

[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:37.020]
it because you know, only an old bastard like me would have been. Jesus told me to put them up.

[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:44.060]
Did he? Yeah. Well, he lied a lot. Jesus Christ. 20th Century Foxes banked the Omen on a

[00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:48.780]
promotional campaign based on 666. The number of, so that's how many listings we got left,

[00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:54.360]
we got 694 votes on a poll. So some of you voted more than once. The number associated with

[00:42:54.360 --> 00:43:00.700]
Satan based on Revelation last book in the Bible, oh, 666, the anti crisis here. What are you going

[00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:06.480]
to do about it? You ferry. Even the films worldwide, they view us at for June 6, 2006, or oh,

[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:14.260]
606, oh, 6, which the studio conveniently assured into 666 and the films logo. And Christian culture,

[00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:18.480]
the number 666, is that before after they wrapped that thing around their way since start

[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:24.000]
flagulating themselves? I'm sure. I just hope that. Opus day. I wonder if Opus day is kind of like

[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:30.100]
Susan day. The number 666 is the symbol of the devil is related by Revelation 13, 18. This calls

[00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:33.740]
for wisdom. If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast for its mans.

[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:40.240]
Its mans number is number 666. The Omen is a story of the father who realizes it adopted infant

[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:47.560]
son Danian, who has a 666 birthmark on his skull as reincarnation of Satan. Oh my god. A

[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:53.460]
maelstrom of death surrounds the way a maelstrom. Oh, that's a lot. The prophecy is clear. The

[00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:58.720]
signs unmistakable. Armageddon is upon us. I wonder if maybe they ought to check on George Bush's

[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:03.520]
forehead. I will say this. The kid in the movie was a lot smarter than George Bush. The use of

[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:07.960]
a satanic promotional campaign comes at a sensitive time after this month's release of the Da Vinci

[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:12.300]
Code for a book done outcry from religious groups protesting the film's car. I'm so sick and

[00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:17.120]
tired of religious group protesting this protest. Don't protest your ass. Protest Joe Bell.

[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:23.240]
Protest the watermelts you get out of our face. God. Normally a market is going to be very weary

[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:28.580]
about using the devil said Robert Thompson, professor of TV at Syracuse University. But 666 is

[00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:31.640]
really merged into popular culture. It's a funny thing you bring up when you're talking about

[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:37.160]
a kid misbehaving in a playground. You say I'll bet this one's got 666 on his skull.

[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:41.540]
But Ted Bayer, president of movie guide, a conservative Christian publication won the

[00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:46.320]
marketing could backfire. Anytime you're overemphasized that he monic in the satanic you're feeding

[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:51.120]
the lesser-insing instincts of people who are susceptible, he said. The marketing could be the

[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:57.080]
biggest drawback of the movie he also said. I like that. That the power of Christ can tell you.

[00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:03.220]
The power of Christ can tell you. The power of Christ can tell you.

[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:08.720]
Yeah, I agree. So there you go. The almonds coming out here is how it would miss that if I were you.

[00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:12.300]
Go on and get the original one with the Lee Rimmick and Gregory Peck.

[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:17.120]
Not too much of Max von Sider. Wasn't he, uh, no father? He was him? I don't know. I'm looking.

[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:19.880]
He wasn't in there. What was the old guy that he played in there?

[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.400]
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm thinking of the officer. Sorry.

[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:25.440]
Different devil movie. You're thinking of the exorcist like that's a bullet in that

[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:30.520]
Max von Sider was father Miran. Come on, Mr. you must have had some bad, bad drugs over the

[00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:34.780]
holiday weekend. It's all I can tell you. You never let the big, oh rock solid.

[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:40.460]
No, no, kept your ass off the streets. Wasn't Max von Sider when the exorcist, no.

[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:44.420]
And Linda Blair wasn't either by the way. Now let's see. The guy that played father,

[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:48.880]
Keras, he's dead. Yes. And there's no way we're going to ever think of what his name was.

[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:53.840]
He better Google it. He's dead. All the acting in that movie was great. That was just,

[00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:56.620]
and you're telling me it's a comedy. You're telling me, ah, it is.

[00:45:56.620 --> 00:46:00.760]
I understand what you're talking about. But it was still well made. It was still well done.

[00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:04.660]
There's no doubt. Especially the Spanish one where she was going down the stairs

[00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:08.460]
backward where the head spinning all around. That was good. And then the one where she was doing

[00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:15.960]
the crucifix deal saying let's use a joy. That was good. 702 votes on the poll.

[00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:22.540]
What you take on Barry Barnes who had the unmitigated gall to his 750th career home run at

[00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:26.580]
home in San Francisco and at goofball at Fonda ball. You see that? I'm sure you all did.

[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:32.400]
Yes, I did. The goofy guy. Oh, I got the ball. It's going to be worth a lot of my millions.

[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:36.540]
Yeah. Not pathetic. By the way, Jason Miller and I'll never. Jason Miller, he's dead.

[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:41.240]
Never going to remember that. No. Well, let's keep it in the next time. Do a word association.

[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:46.620]
Think of David Miller, the harness driver at the moment. Oh, yeah. That'll be easy. Or Del Miller,

[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:51.560]
the great harness driver, dead. See a lot of dead millers. You know that? I sure hope George

[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:55.280]
Miller is one of them. I remember George Miller from the dolphins cove health food store in the

[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:59.540]
Gables. He used to be a guest in my show. No, I couldn't. They want to use to put those boring. He's

[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:02.940]
a good guy. George. I wonder what happened. He got out of the he got out of the retail because the

[00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:07.460]
demographic and the Gables started changing desperately. No, speaking of English, IE. And he

[00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:13.140]
went into the like police work or something. 1057 at 560 Q and we got the Geltie show like

[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:17.960]
people sat in on. What did I just do there? Oh, look at that. You got me so excited again about

[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:21.740]
the old man. I've punched it down around the audition line again. I'm sorry. Go check. He

[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:38.960]
will not happen. This is the Neil Roger show. This is your brain. Any questions?

[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:47.180]
Last time we got the guy's way. Now we've got one for the girls. That's right. We're going to get

[00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:51.980]
you pregnant. A regular. But in the evening of the you'll be the official mother of a morning

[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:58.400]
show when our morning guy knocks you up. Just be listening and be the third color. When you hear this

[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:06.120]
tower, we put on a long record and send the morning guy over to your place to make that two back

[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:11.740]
beats. Should the morning guy be unable to perform due to chronic impetus or infertility,

[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:15.580]
the overnight guy who desperately wants his job will perform in his place. In that event,

[00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:18.440]
this station makes no guarantees about eye color, fair color, IQ,

[00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:21.740]
hunts or additional limbs. Have the morning guys love the child.

[00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:26.700]
I'm a station creating a new generation of listeners. People must be so weird. It's $11.02 at 560,

[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:33.520]
or at $483,000 in small bills in my freezer. 718 votes. What's your take on very bonds? Without

[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:41.100]
Roy's, he's just another joke. Just another dumb joke with a really bad altitude. 205. He couldn't

[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:47.900]
lick the baby's jock 135 even if he wanted to. His stance are bogus 124. See, all those top three are

[00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:53.600]
like, he's good, not great, 64. I'll even give you that one. I hate baseball 58. Well, shame on you,

[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:58.700]
so do I. He's the greatest 51. Josh Cordis breathlessly. He was there to see very yesterday.

[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:04.600]
Now, were you rooting for the giants? No. Well, why not? That's your boy. I'm not a giants fan.

[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:09.200]
I'm a Marlin fan. You're a very bonds fan. Yes, I am. Well, how can you root against the giants

[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:12.700]
if you're a very bonds fan? You just can't make up your mind. You're all over the place.

[00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:18.280]
I hate him 42 and I hate this pool. Only 38. They like this pool. And you want to know why? Because

[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:23.900]
it's got a lot of hate in it. Like that. That's why we ought to bring back the excesses. Let's have,

[00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:28.440]
that's how we can make some serious money. Let's run out about 100 theaters, all of a self-food and

[00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:34.400]
re-show the excesses to mid-end times. Right. And just show her a pink and up that pea soup. Oh, yeah.

[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:40.740]
Are you eating now or something? Sounds to me. I was. Just what was that? What was that? That pea soup?

[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:43.700]
You were eating, huh? Oh, I was. Say it which? From Howie's. Yes.

[00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:47.040]
Talk about it here, Josh. Oh, I finished mine real quick.

[00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:54.200]
Well, wait till you hear this story. This is so typical of Florida. Anybody over here? A Waldo,

[00:49:54.320 --> 00:50:03.700]
Florida? Waldo? Yeah. No. It must be up north because this is from NBC 12 and ABC 12. I don't

[00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:08.180]
understand that. Yeah. Well, everything is north of here. Jacksonville. But I'm just saying, Jacksonville.

[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:14.180]
Waldo, Florida, Detective States and Active Local Terrorism and Adult Bookstore is cleaning up after

[00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:18.680]
a chemical attack by a homemade device that investigators are calling a weapon of matter destruction.

[00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:21.780]
That's where they are, W. Should we look it over here at the Adult Bookstore?

[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:23.980]
You're right. We're in the middle of the room. We're in the middle of the room. Right.

[00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:30.960]
Can here's a picture of the sign? Cafe Riscay Adult Supercenter. Oh, that's the place where

[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:34.620]
there's a million billboards when you go up the highway, just like one every mile for that.

[00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:40.300]
There's the highway? Yeah. For Cafe Riscay? Mm-hmm. Wow. In Waldo, people have held prayer

[00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:45.720]
vigils and protests aimed at an Adult Bookstore along US 301 trying to keep the cafe Riscay from

[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:49.960]
opening its doors on time. Well, that must be why they're all the billboards because they're trying

[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:54.780]
to open, trying. Mm-hmm. Those efforts have all failed. So investigators say it looks like someone

[00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:59.460]
has turned to what they're calling a clear-active terrorism to keep the store's owners from opening up shop.

[00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:06.600]
Oh, Florida, man. What a place. What am I told you for like 30 years now about Florida?

[00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:10.200]
It's the deep south. You know, you can try to pretend well. We're not different. We're not

[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:15.780]
like Mississippi and Alabama and Louisiana. Right. There we are. Rednecks, man. Rednecks, crackers,

[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:21.160]
Bible thumpers. The device discovered Sunday morning was made of two gallon-sized sport drink

[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:26.500]
jugs connected by Hoses. It's another Hose job. Someone said it on top of the store is a window

[00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:31.300]
air conditioning unit. Detectives say that person ends strong one hose from a water spigot on the

[00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:35.380]
outside of the building and pushed another hose into the building through a gap of the air conditioner.

[00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:41.320]
They stuck in the old tube. That water hose would churn it, mix it up in the gallon jug, and then

[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:44.940]
enter into the building. So the last of a county share sergeant Keith Falk. I guess that's where

[00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:50.260]
must be in Latchival County. Where's that? Up Yonder. Is that up by Duval County? Must be, I guess.

[00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:55.000]
A Florida place. Investigators say one of the jugs had a harmful substance inside that float in the

[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:59.540]
store along with the water. A harmful substance. And I guarantee it probably won't be the last harmful

[00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:03.300]
substance in Antibulline. We haven't identified it was actually in the bottle and the system

[00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:07.300]
that delivered it in the building. We do know that it was cost to kill was corrosive. It had a high

[00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:12.260]
pH level Falk said. Investigators say the state affirmative environment, a protection test, the

[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:17.200]
contraption in slabs today, the finger out exactly what was inside. What's big of that? It's

[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:23.020]
speaking of obnoxious and corrosive. There's Dana Bansch. Oh god. Taking, let's get very

[00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:27.180]
bronze to see if he can swing the bat at her head. Yeah, Basha. And smash it like a pumpkin

[00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:32.740]
and a Halloween time. Oh, brother. The old shrunk. Didn't you look like she's got a shrunken head

[00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:37.860]
seriously? It's the bottom half of it is shrunken more than the top half. Wow. Strange. Yeah.

[00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:43.020]
Homemade but highly effective. The device had the hazmat teams in full year Sunday morning. By

[00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:47.900]
yesterday, clean up teams had stripped the room bare. Everything that was inside is now outside.

[00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:52.760]
The contaminated trash filled two dumpsters high above the dumpsters a security camera is

[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:56.800]
strapped to the pool. Investigators say it was rolling Saturday when the device was planted. We do

[00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:00.480]
have some very good leads. We have some people are interested in what probably some good people

[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:05.800]
of God, some good Christians know that nobody was hurt by the chemical investigators say cleaning

[00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:11.160]
the up cost more than 15 grand as that's the hazmat bill of around 15 grand. And you see it's

[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:16.460]
been a costly event. You had 15 and 15. What do you got? Right. WDQAM. Hello.

[00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:21.540]
Hello. Yes, sir. Hey, I heard a nasty rumor the other day. This is only this true. Are you gay?

[00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:26.520]
The scale was small only one room was ruined but you can't say the punishment will be much more

[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:31.100]
substantial. Under state law by the book deputy say the device is a weapon of mass destruction.

[00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:35.060]
They're looking at hundreds of thousands of dollars and fines and how many years in jail?

[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:40.040]
But third, man. Folks said you try to hurt people. You try to change their ideas or instill fear and

[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:44.400]
that's exactly what the terrorists do. So this person is a local, yokeal terrorist is what they

[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:49.300]
be saying. WDQAM. Hello. Hey, how you doing there, Pally. Okay. A couple of things. Well,

[00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:56.520]
those about 45 miles north of Gameville, Florida would have trained. Wow. All right. Also, I just

[00:53:56.520 --> 00:54:01.700]
drove back from Atlanta and I've never seen more business trucks with a little fish on the back.

[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:09.440]
Like, like, like, it's like, it's like, it must be a club. Really must be a club. It is.

[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:15.060]
Here in the club. Gate club. Okay. What did you just say? I have no idea what he said.

[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:22.440]
That's what he said. That's a gate club. You moron. Right. Well, that's what all religions are anyway.

[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:27.460]
They're all in there. It's like a holy roar. That's a good example of it. Yeah.

[00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:30.940]
They're rolling it and they're smoking it and they're rolling on each other. I wonder if they didn't

[00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:38.260]
that church. Oh, man. I just, although I got to say the thing with Opus Day that I saw last

[00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:42.920]
day, that sent me to a new level of, uh, discussed and contempt. That's how they know that they're more

[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:47.760]
pious than the rest of us. Oh, is that it? Because they can feel their love. How about some punky

[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:53.020]
pious? Mm. What's your take on very bond? 727 votes. I'm not going to read the result again.

[00:54:53.080 --> 00:55:00.200]
They hate him. Let's see. He's the greatest 51 51. He's the greatest. And that includes Joshua. How

[00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:03.420]
many times you're all 52 now? How many times you vote about 20? How I just want, buddy?

[00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:08.700]
About 30. That's what I'm thinking. Most of those year voted. How many Q.A.M. Hello?

[00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:14.880]
They knew. Yes, sir. Um, the other day you said a mention Canada and I was wondering, uh,

[00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:21.080]
since we were in Canada, uh, doesn't that make you coward? You're running away from your problem?

[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:24.700]
Yeah, right. Uh, yeah. I'm, I'm eligible to be drafted. I know there wasn't a

[00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:28.180]
one. 63 years old, right? Too bad. Talked over him. Q.A.M. Hello?

[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:33.980]
Hey, Leo. Yes, sir. Hey, Leo. Uh, 30 bond that never failed the drug test. Do you know that?

[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:41.080]
Do you know that? Someone has that proof. He's never failed the drug test. Uh, that group was

[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:45.320]
at Drunken Roses faster. The only way to get one is to get one. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. I hope you

[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:47.900]
don't very have a great life together. Okay. You're going to be the top of the bottom.

[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:54.540]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. I never failed the drug test. Uh, huh? And I either. Huh? Me either.

[00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:58.160]
Yeah, there you go. That must have proved that George don't do any drugs. He never failed the drug test.

[00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:02.360]
Right. Taking two of them. No. A drug test. Neither of what's his name in the clockwork orange.

[00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:07.080]
Alex never failed. What? Never failed the drug test. Uh, that's funny because we're watching a

[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:10.840]
mortal beloved over the weekend. Well, I'll be in the movie by the way. Dominic Q.A.M. Hello?

[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:18.860]
Hey, yes, sir. Uh, I think it's time to back off very much. You know, maybe reassess your take on that.

[00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:23.040]
Yeah. Reassess your take on ever calling this again. That's my suggestion. Our pinkies got his hand on

[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:26.740]
his pants. It sounded like it's an armidlil. He was thinking of that baby route.

[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:32.680]
Maybe he was tapping it. Dominic, a phone line at his Q.A.M. Hello.

[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:36.200]
I thanks for that recommendation on that ministry.

[00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:42.960]
Um, music, uh, then any type of stuff. Oh, I think you got it. I forgot to get it. I forgot to

[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:47.180]
pick it up. I forgot to. It was a call. I could take the credit for it. It's a caller promoted.

[00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:52.980]
Like, okay, welcome. Okay, let's go out and get ministry. Okay, let's minister to, uh, let's

[00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:57.060]
point that thing around our waist with all of them sharp hooks in it. Them fish hooks and treble hooks

[00:56:57.060 --> 00:57:00.900]
in there and tied up with the pitch. And then we'll get the kisses and the tefilon. They'll

[00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:05.280]
lay some tefilon too. Then we'll do like those Eastern Asian religions. Can you imagine?

[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:10.500]
With the super lesions. We'll start whipping and flage-lating, man. Think about it. You get the, uh,

[00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:14.800]
the doors to show it. Then all these religions, it's the same thing. It's like an S&M game.

[00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:20.320]
Absolutely. How much pain can you endure to, you know, like, like Jesus is suffering or to show

[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:24.360]
God how worthy you are of whatever it is. You know, well, you know, God wants you to suffer because

[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:29.120]
He's a God of love that for him. Yeah. He's right. He's a loving God. And that's why he gets pissed off

[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:34.020]
and he's also a perfect God that gets pissed off and his wrath waxes hot and he's got the locusts

[00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:38.220]
and he's got the floods and if that don't work, he's got some other kind of crap up his sleeve.

[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:43.480]
Loyal, man. Like, what do you think? I wonder if it's an icy sleeve of God's icy shoes.

[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:48.200]
Sure. It's like he hot. Where you're going and me and all of us and guaranteed, Josh Cordis,

[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:51.880]
oh, brother, here he'll be sitting there at the table waiting for us. I'd see the other way around.

[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.320]
We've got regular labor. That's right. You never know, though. Take me to see.

[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:58.160]
Something could walk outside and get hit by a Mack truck any second now.

[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:03.920]
12 minutes past 11, maybe like one of our management people get hit by a Mack truck. All the

[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:07.600]
white, you know, the old saying that fits in for that where there's no sense, there's no feeling.

[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:12.980]
Seriously, I'm not joking about this. The conversation that I had with your fearless leader on

[00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:18.540]
Friday, I could have been, I'm looking at like this speaker, this JBL speaker that's sitting here,

[00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:23.820]
there's two big ones. I could sit here and talk to the speaker and have a more coherent,

[00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:27.880]
kind, meaningful conversation that what I had on the phone. I wasted all that time out of my life.

[00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:32.700]
I could have been having a really heavy duty ball moment. Something really productive.

[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:39.280]
And instead, hey, hurry, hey, hey, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho,

[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:43.560]
Just just a cheerleader. I'm always very nervous about guys who are here. They're like,

[00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:49.160]
a lot of front-line George Bush and George W. There's a good example for you.

[00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:55.580]
Like that. Like the religionists. Just remember that. All you kids out there, they're out of school now.

[00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:59.720]
The religious people are the crazy people. Stay away from them. And sure as hell, stay away from those

[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:04.720]
priestesses. Oh my god. Stay away from any guy that wears a dress. That's good.

[00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:07.920]
That Pope was an Auschwitz over the weekend. That boy, he sure fit in good there.

[00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:11.820]
Didn't he look good there? Oh yeah, perfect. He fell right at home. Would it look better in one of those

[00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:18.080]
ovens? Oh man. He said, he loved it. He said it was a gas. He could say 48 rhymes with ass.

[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:21.760]
Back home, which is what they specialize in. Boy, M. Swish guard, man. He sure are pretty.

[00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:24.600]
Now they're still giving us that thing. We're starting to do this spot now.

[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:27.760]
No, what? Oh, that's right. We got to talk about your scene. How much do you talk about the

[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:31.460]
yesterday? Briefly. Everything was brief. Yes. Well, we'll get a, well, I'm sure Justin

[00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:34.520]
watched it. Not again. Oh, that's where he sought the first.

[00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:38.440]
Oh, yeah. Already had sought. Josh is the one that sought and loved it. You're the one that we finally

[00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:42.080]
got him. I'm sorry, but I'm with it. What does that mean? You can call me and call up the third.

[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:46.960]
And you, Monati and all this other goy. I'm a lot of goy. I mean, I think 14 past 11 at 5,

[00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:51.220]
60 WQM. If you think you might have termites in your home, guess what? Right now that as we

[00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:54.800]
were speaking, it's the beginning of termite season. This is when they start chewing your house to bits.

[00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:59.880]
So call ridded pest control today for a free termite inspection and do it now. Why you still

[00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:04.340]
got a house in one piece? Ridded pest control uses an amazing orange oil treatment that kills

[01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:09.660]
termites and their termite eggs 100% on contact. They're gone faster than you can say. Joe

[01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:13.620]
Bells are lunatic. If you have termites, it's the best possible way to get rid of them. You don't

[01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:17.600]
have to tense your home and make your whole neighborhood into a big circus. You don't have to worry

[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:21.900]
about poison, it's gas, no moving out or staying in hotels or motels. No worry about food or pets

[01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:26.120]
in your health because that ridded pest control, they treat your home with this amazing orange oil.

[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:28.940]
And you don't have to leave it all. In fact, when they don't treating your property,

[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:32.720]
the only thing left behind is the clean set of oranges for just a few days. You'll be on the

[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:36.540]
ceiling sniffing all over the place. That's how good it's going to smell. It's true if you have

[01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:39.740]
a termite problem call ridded pest control right now. I'm fine. I'm about to say this amazing

[01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:45.600]
orange oil treatment that kills termites and their eggs 100% on contact. No tending, no kidding.

[01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:49.580]
Call right now for free inspection. There's no obligation. Now is the smart time to call

[01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:57.440]
1-800-447-4348. That's 1-800-447-4348. Be sure and tell me the Todd Dreck to

[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:03.180]
order to call ridded pest control 1-800-447-43-48.

[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:09.920]
This is Neil Rogers. What's all it? This is 5.69 am.

[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:16.020]
West, if you can't tell the difference between me and Ron Jeremy, you should try girls.

[01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:17.600]
Who sounds like the moral?

[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.020]
I guess it's not. Every time you see me, it's the way God wants it to be.

[01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:27.260]
He wants to take a city and cover it to sleep. Renaming can.

[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:31.260]
Renaming can? Renaming can.

[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:37.820]
Renaming can cause he wants to make you or leave peace.

[01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:41.860]
And I don't care what people are saying. Just like Jesse Jackson.

[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:45.100]
We are black people. His comments are bizarre.

[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:50.340]
Surely God is there. He compares the moccasue a willy on the fog.

[01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:57.480]
Chalking in. Yes, Renaming can.

[01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:02.160]
Renaming can cause he wants to make you or leave peace.

[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:02.600]
Yes.

[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:10.420]
His job was to come together. His job was to rebuild a New Orleans.

[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:15.200]
The one that should be uptown or wherever they are.

[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.000]
This city will be chocolate. A chocolate New Orleans.

[01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:27.160]
He never takes the blame. For anything that's chocolate at the end of the day.

[01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:31.820]
That's chocolate and some coffee and a cup of warm cold air. Renaming can.

[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:42.160]
Renaming can. No, I can't. Renaming can cause he wants to make you or leave peace.

[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:46.100]
You can't have New Orleans. No, I'm the way.

[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:47.780]
It wasn't made to the wall.

[01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:51.940]
Twenty past eleven. That's why he got reelected last weekend is because he's a real moron.

[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:54.760]
You know, and that's they like that. And what have I always told you about New Orleans?

[01:02:55.640 --> 01:03:00.260]
Slimey place. Man, it is dumber than sawdust. Dumber than a box of turds.

[01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:04.620]
That's how a dumb man. And then the average IQ is like a minus in front of it in New Orleans.

[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:07.500]
That's why Renaming got in again. Because he's a noggin head.

[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:12.120]
Indian. Seven hour sixty three votes. Our goal is twelve thousand of a before two o'clock.

[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:16.080]
Before a girl becomes young. And makes those piercing sounds. So you watch

[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:19.120]
you're illuminating angels and demons on an A and E Saturday morning and.

[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:24.020]
That's great. I told you before the show. I knew a lot about the Catholic Church's dark history

[01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:28.720]
from from before. But I didn't know about all that illuminati in the Templar.

[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:31.960]
That's a nice Templar. Yeah. What a what a bunch. What a fun.

[01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:34.420]
Oh, we're on a temple. He used to run the Mason's raceway.

[01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:37.780]
How do you get into that? I figure you know if they're going to be taken over the world

[01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:40.940]
and all that stuff, it's probably a good idea to get in with them.

[01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:44.880]
Yeah. How do you do the city? How do you fly? And you got to rub the whole thing.

[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:49.560]
As long as there's not too much factory. Oh, there's a lot about those secret societies.

[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:53.300]
It just seems to be. I got to get that. By Jim Mars ruled by secrecy.

[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:56.900]
Is it about factory? No, no. It's about the angels and demons.

[01:03:57.060 --> 01:04:00.000]
Oh, all right. Ruled by secrecy. You know, it's a member. Jim Mars was on it.

[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.840]
I don't think you watched it either. I did so. He was the guy with a hat that was on there.

[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:08.060]
Oh, that guy. What are you laughing at? That'd be confused with the guy with the long hair.

[01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:11.220]
No, you know the one I'm talking about. Yes, I did. Come on.

[01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:14.520]
He had a lot of things to do. Anyway, he writes all these conspiracy books.

[01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:18.240]
So I don't know whether he's just a crazy person, but he's not as crazy as them religious people.

[01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:22.260]
Like that. And let me tell you all you kids are out of school now.

[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:25.160]
If any religious like the Watchtower people come knocking on your door,

[01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:28.360]
right? Well, you're home from a school trying to pet a piece of religious crap.

[01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:32.140]
Just go out of the drawer where Danny keeps his gun and pull their crap away.

[01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:34.720]
Okay, now don't do it to the Mormons though because I like Johnny Osmond.

[01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:38.880]
Plus a lot of them look pretty good. I've done Maria Osmond's on this campaign to clean it.

[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:42.700]
Yeah, like I said, unbelievable. Look then have it too.

[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:45.380]
Because now we got that new lawn floater, you're a October.

[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:49.160]
And if somebody represents a threat to you, you just pull out a piece

[01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:51.220]
and blow that crap away. That's a way to do it.

[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:54.160]
And not only will you get off easy, you get off scot free,

[01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:56.880]
but also you get like a purple medal in a gold jelly bean. That's right.

[01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:00.120]
What I'm hearing. I was speaking of bozoes. There's your buddy.

[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:03.420]
The United States stands ready to help. Oh my God.

[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:06.440]
So, I'm a drummer like I said in a box of horse turds.

[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:09.900]
Look at this. Downloads of net porn had record high.

[01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:12.140]
We were going to take some of these calls though because it's a day after the

[01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:13.700]
holiday. I'm going to start downloading some porn.

[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:16.600]
You take any calls yesterday? I took a few.

[01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:19.260]
They were damn few to take and what?

[01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:22.980]
You know, like three WQAM. Hello.

[01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:25.360]
Yes, Neil. Yes, sir.

[01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:29.460]
I had a great weekend. There was Jewish heritage.

[01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:32.580]
I would get at the Dalfen Stadium.

[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:35.200]
Oh, what does that mean? Jewish heritage?

[01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:36.620]
What does that mean?

[01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:39.300]
Well, that's the state is. It was an Israeli American.

[01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:42.020]
Well, they have about old Jews from sunrise lakes there.

[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:42.840]
Well, what does that mean?

[01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:43.940]
I wish they were.

[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.060]
And what is it? What is it?

[01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:46.360]
What is it really? You have to do with Jewish.

[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:47.640]
Is really going to do with Jewish?

[01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:49.300]
Well, there was called Jewish heritage.

[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:50.620]
We can do two AMs there.

[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:51.380]
It was out there.

[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:53.200]
Yeah, nobody in it.

[01:05:53.780 --> 01:05:55.920]
Well, because they only did go to work on the weekend.

[01:05:56.520 --> 01:06:00.240]
Well, I was trying to break into the van to get some, you know,

[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:02.540]
powerful area, but nobody was around.

[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:04.780]
We don't have anything in there. We auctioned it all off on eBay.

[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:07.040]
But anyway, happy some historic story to you.

[01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:10.360]
5670560 Jewish heritage weekend.

[01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:12.820]
My ass. Maybe that's why I buried Bonz here up yesterday.

[01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:13.660]
And he Jewish?

[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:15.520]
328 and hello.

[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:16.600]
Hey, Neil.

[01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:17.480]
Yes, sir.

[01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:19.040]
I didn't get a chance.

[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:22.420]
I think last week you were talking about old Kenny Ray and Jeff

[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:28.000]
what do you want to bet that he's going to get pardoned by George

[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:28.960]
No chance.

[01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:31.180]
Bush don't even remember who the hell that is anymore.

[01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:34.700]
Oh, man. They're doing Clinton all that hard for pardoning that guy.

[01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:35.760]
I mean, Mark Richards.

[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:38.700]
They write and write fully so by the way, rightfully so.

[01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:39.600]
I'm doing a grand.

[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:40.960]
But there's that thing.

[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:43.580]
He's not going to pardon Kenny Ray or Jeff's killing.

[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:44.420]
Okay, trust me.

[01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:46.380]
And if they did that, then the Republicans,

[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:49.100]
congressional Republicans would lynch his ass.

[01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:49.480]
Okay.

[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:50.620]
Get out of here.

[01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:53.460]
See, this is what what are we dealing with here, man?

[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:53.960]
America.

[01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:55.380]
What are we dealing with there?

[01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:57.960]
We're talking about illuminating angels and demons.

[01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:02.060]
You know the stuff I'd never got one call or one facts from anybody who said,

[01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:03.840]
oh gee, thanks for turning us out of that.

[01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:06.340]
I showed that was really interesting and we wanted to know.

[01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:06.940]
Not one.

[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:09.200]
This audience don't watch A&E.

[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:09.940]
They're busy with that.

[01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:10.600]
American.

[01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:11.800]
I mean, watch A&I.

[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:12.580]
American Idol.

[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:14.660]
With that silver here.

[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:15.800]
That's screaming around there.

[01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:19.160]
Playing in that silver flaming screamer.

[01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:20.200]
My God.

[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:24.320]
And from what you told me, couldn't see his wet about out of a paper cup.

[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:25.760]
He sings like he dances.

[01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:26.520]
Terrible.

[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:27.060]
Oh, no.

[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:28.520]
He sings any dances?

[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:29.020]
Oh, yeah.

[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:29.800]
Wow.

[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:31.120]
That's great.

[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:32.300]
What's his name again?

[01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:33.260]
Oh, no.

[01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:34.860]
He's got a hammer, hex.

[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:35.820]
You better get a tanner.

[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:36.400]
You're fair.

[01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:37.480]
We got a bit about him, yeah.

[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:38.160]
I bet you.

[01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:41.480]
He's in the same closet with Tom Cruise and John Reholtto and still won't come out.

[01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:42.340]
You're not a thug.

[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.880]
I'm going to watch that again this week.

[01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:47.740]
I'm so glad you sent me that.

[01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:48.680]
It's a keeper.

[01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:50.920]
Oh, it's the open one.

[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:52.460]
The open one you build up too much.

[01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:55.080]
You know, once again, let's build up this time.

[01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:56.320]
Pretend I built it up.

[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:57.780]
I would never watch that one again.

[01:07:58.380 --> 01:07:59.160]
He's got a.

[01:07:59.200 --> 01:07:59.620]
He's got a.

[01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:01.460]
A couple of body parts.

[01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:02.320]
Well, good for her.

[01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:02.600]
Okay.

[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:03.480]
He's probably looking tall.

[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:05.360]
Then I always said if she talked out of her ass anyway.

[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:06.180]
You did.

[01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:07.200]
I always told you.

[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:08.080]
That's where they got it from.

[01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:09.180]
Crazy ass bitch.

[01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:10.420]
I'll for a set.

[01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:11.440]
Even my mother used to.

[01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:14.040]
Oh boy.

[01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:15.540]
Isn't that sad?

[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:18.580]
That's what happens when you got too much time on your hands and look at out of the house

[01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:18.980]
too much.

[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:21.260]
Like you said, shut in housewives.

[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:22.840]
Shut in fat house shuttons.

[01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:23.380]
Yeah, right.

[01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:24.380]
Fat shuttons.

[01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:26.160]
There must be about how many million.

[01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:28.880]
30 million fat shuttons in America.

[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:30.060]
They're all watching Oprah.

[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:34.740]
When I see that all the rappers now are coming on on her ass.

[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:35.240]
You see that?

[01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:37.260]
Who is the last one that's a rip in a renance?

[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:38.080]
No, I don't know.

[01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:38.940]
Fitty cent.

[01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:39.520]
Good.

They're all over her like stink on Joe, man.

[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:43.380]
Better watch out for Fitty.

[01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:45.720]
You know, dude, and she won't invite him on a show.

[01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:47.020]
Right, right, right.

[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:48.840]

27 past 11 a.k.u.

[01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:53.380]
I mean, sometimes it's the things you can't see that hurt you that are dangerous

[01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:53.840]
for you.

[01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:55.540]
Notice, by the way, I got rid of my crud.

[01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:56.320]
I noticed that.

[01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:58.600]
I had a good cleansing experience at Woodline yesterday.

[01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:01.140]
I got rid of most of the money I won Saturday too, but that's okay.

[01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:02.540]
Bad machines, man.

[01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:03.360]

I don't idea what I was about to see.

[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:15.400]
They were speaking in tongue.

[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.380]
I don't know if they were in Bracey or in the church.

[01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:29.540]
I thought I'd come to the beach.

[01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:34.740]
There's a curse around whatever I do, ill forgive me.

[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:36.940]
Oh, God, I speak in tongue.

[01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:40.000]
That makes me a believer.

[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:43.220]
And look at his phone.

[01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:47.500]
And round the time out.

[01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:50.000]
That makes me a believer.

[01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:07.420]
And look at his phone.

[01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:08.360]
And look at his phone.

[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:08.440]

[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:08.440]

[01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:09.980]
And look at his phone.

[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:32.740]
And look at his phone.

[01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:33.120]
And look at his phone.

[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:33.120]

[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:33.120]

[01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:33.180]

[01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:39.020]
And look at his phone.

[01:12:47.420 --> 01:13:00.980]
I didn't take a stand because I was relaxed.

[01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:29.080]
S 클리어 스피� Shaikh

[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:33.080]
to be the Christian state. How about like Massachusetts for all the atheist

[01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:37.320]
diagnostics? Why Massachusetts? Because I'm just thinking of a place where there's

[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:40.000]
like already a lot of liberal people, although they got that heavy Catholic

[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.060]
food in Boston, we're just half a cent all of them Catholics back to England.

[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:47.000]
I think it a little bigger, something a little bit more real estate like where?

[01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:51.080]
Like Washington State or Oregon since we were just having that. Oh geez, it rains

[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:53.960]
all the time there, although the weather Massachusetts ain't too good. That makes it

[01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:59.300]
lush and dust free. It makes it for lush. Yeah, believe that. You and that

[01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:02.660]
Northwest, man. I don't want to love the Northwest. I've always constant. Never

[01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:07.280]
been there. To the truth. I get to try to think of a place where we don't already

[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:10.820]
have like so many Bible thumbpresses. Right. Like the Northwest. So it has to be

[01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:17.300]
outside of the US. How about Hawaii? Okay. Oh yeah. No more religion in Hawaii.

[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:21.360]
That's what I say. Religion could be like surfing, surfing and food and getting

[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:25.320]
lead. I think that's really what's all about already. Right. It's been a long

[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:29.540]
lead. Downloads of MedPoor and Record High. Record numbers of people are downloading

[01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:32.800]
pornography from the internet. A survey revealed yesterday is that that's some big

[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:37.600]
surprise. Oh, don't tell Maria. She is pissed off and fired up, man. She wants to

[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:41.800]
like attack the internet. Just cause her daughters are a couple of preverts. And

[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:45.020]
campaigners fear that as computer porn becomes more widespread, it'll give more

[01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:48.560]
men unrealistic expectations of their love lives and threatened couples

[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:52.500]
relationships. I don't understand what one has to do with the other, but nevertheless.

[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.420]
It's part of the whole making a case against porn that the church is of always

[01:14:56.420 --> 01:15:00.240]
Oh, there's a lot more of that. More than a month. There are also concerns that

[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:02.840]
the growing number of people hooked on adult sites will fuel the man for

[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:06.320]
illegal material such as child abuse. That's another myth that they like to

[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:10.160]
promote. More than nine million men, almost 40% of the adult male population

[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:13.560]
logged on to sex websites last year more than four times as many as the

[01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:17.300]
estimated two million in 2000. What most of those men were trying to say is I have

[01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:20.900]
no life. The number of women downloading internet porn sort 30%

[01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:25.340]
about a man to 1.4 million. You go girls for and including in that

[01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:29.620]
thing, even counting Maria's men's daughters. Catching up to do 40% of couples

[01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:32.480]
having problems with their relationships say internet porn is at least partly

[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:36.060]
to blame. Perfect. I know George says that. Yeah, yeah.

[01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:39.460]
And actually, George said his wife is all to blame. Relationship experts

[01:15:39.460 --> 01:15:42.300]
said women have to compete with perfect models online, which could lead to

[01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:45.240]
exploiting the people unable to hold on normal relationships.

[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:48.060]
How come they don't look like her? How come they don't look like him?

[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:52.580]
Er. How can't we look like it? Christine Lacey, a senior counselor with

[01:15:52.580 --> 01:15:56.520]
relationship advice service relate said on the internet, there are no bounds.

[01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:59.880]
You can look at the most perfect bodies doing the most unusual sex practices

[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:03.600]
and having sex whenever you want to watch. And of course, everybody is thinking

[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:07.860]
all right. Why do you need to go online for that? You don't.

[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:11.120]
I don't say it. He's in the T cable channels and the

[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:13.520]
D.B.D.s and the D.B.D.s and the D.B.D.s and the D.B.D.s and the D.B.D.s and the

[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:15.580]
T cable channels. I guess something new that go under the video.

[01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:18.160]
That's strictly the purview of the internet.

[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:22.820]
Bits clubs. Yeah, there you go. And in the place up there in Waldo, in the

[01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:27.100]
size parlour, the local emers ugly. What normal woman can compete with that?

[01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:30.080]
If people are watching this sort of thing all the time with that contact,

[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:35.100]
whether the people can normalize it. Clinical psychologists know

[01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:38.700]
that they're Oliver Sumpton said, well, I can't read that last name.

[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:42.780]
If a man looks at a lot of porn oil, which women are essentially slaves,

[01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:45.160]
it interferes with their ability to stay in a real relationship.

[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:48.020]
Well, not if they got some good whips and chains like Josh's got.

[01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:51.000]
That's right. The cable. What do you laugh at about it?

[01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:53.700]
You told me that you tie her up by doing that instrument thing and put her in

[01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:55.720]
chains and tie her up on a wall. That's very big.

[01:16:56.060 --> 01:16:58.480]
Red rubber ball. And put that red rubber ball. A joyous was kind of

[01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:01.340]
enough to send via an or mouth. Careful, though, because you never know where

[01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:04.400]
a joy is headed. The finding, be sure and wash it off. The finding is

[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:07.260]
made of what has thought to be the first definitive study of internet pornography

[01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:11.060]
for the independent of Britain on Sunday by analyst Nielsen Net ratings.

[01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:15.380]
The research found that men and women who visited such sites spend 40 minutes

[01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:19.900]
and average each month, each month looking at images, while 40 minutes each month,

[01:17:20.380 --> 01:17:21.960]
that's like about what, 11 minutes a day?

[01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:25.220]
That's nothing. Why? I said, that's nothing.

[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:28.940]
One in four minutes, 25 to 49, about two in half minute viewed online,

[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:31.740]
hardcore images in the past month alone. One in four.

[01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:35.540]
I think it's more like five in four. That's 1.3 minutes a day.

[01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:39.380]
Oh, and the explosion of internet pornography, you know, it's 11 minutes.

[01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:42.620]
Oh, I read everything. And the explosion of internet porn is also resulted

[01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:45.540]
more than half of all know you're right. You're right. 1.3 is correct.

[01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:48.920]
Resulted more than half of all children viewing adult images while looking for

[01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:52.060]
something else. Liberal Democrat health spokesman Sandra Gidley,

[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:54.880]
this is in Britain, said she was alarmed by the material available, and especially

[01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:57.800]
how easy it is for children to be exposed to. Oh, yeah, here we go with the children.

[01:17:57.860 --> 01:18:01.500]
I think much more dangerous for the British is to be exposed to that royal family man.

[01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:05.660]
They're all a bunch of preverts, including that, including that Prince Charlie there

[01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:08.960]
who was buggering one of his butlers there and all of a sudden they covered that

[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:12.200]
syrup realized they paint some people off and shut them up real fast on that.

[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:16.600]
Just like that whole Diana business man. After we're finished with that

[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:19.740]
eliminating angels and demons and seeing about the homens and the corruption

[01:18:19.740 --> 01:18:23.020]
in the Catholic Church, let's do the next expose. Let's make a movie out of that,

[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:26.840]
or the royals by Kitty Kelly. Right. And see we just walk kind of out.

[01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:30.000]
There's Barbara breaking down again in the preckness as if we need to see that again.

[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.420]
What? Why do we need to see this again? What? Who did whole?

[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:37.240]
Because it's sick to make a sick to our stomach, okay?

[01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:41.600]
Including this guy there on CNN. I can't deal with him. What's his name? Tony Setterna.

[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:45.040]
This is a live mocha guy. Doctor Liberty. What a jackass. He doesn't even

[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:48.760]
read the news. He just editorializes. Everything's like a big comedian.

[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:52.560]
Things he's doing sit down comedy. They got the most anxious people on that

[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:55.200]
network, including that fat face to hero. You're as blue dogs.

[01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:57.520]
Man, I hope you're looking at him legal alien.

[01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:02.060]
Would that be the rag his fan asked across the Mexican border make tacos out of him?

[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:04.540]
802 votes on the pool. Let's see. Is it enough?

[01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:08.400]
Very friendly and very cooperative. He does pretty much anything.

[01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:11.660]
He's doing fine. Bravo. Just calm down. He's doing okay.

[01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:14.680]
802 votes. What's your take on Barry bonds?

[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:17.860]
A Barry. Take a big fat one. That's our take on you.

[01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:20.580]
Barry and the lighted up. Oh, that's where he waiting. I get him confused.

[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:23.880]
See Barry ain't into that smoking at wicked weed like you guys.

[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:26.280]
He's more into that the Schmier and Beckham.

[01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:28.500]
He's like a cream. He likes to. He loves it. Needles.

[01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:32.680]
I says here without Roy. It's very just another jock 227.

[01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:36.980]
He couldn't lick the baby's jock 153. Lot of jocks in here.

[01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:40.020]
His stats are bogus 139. There's no doubt about that.

[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:44.080]
Totally bogus drug induced piece of turd. We hate you Barry.

[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:45.900]
I hope you're listening right now. I'm sure you're not.

[01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:49.160]
Maybe you're listening to Stan Major. He's still alive by the way.

[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:51.640]
Has my two grand ought to be about 10 million by now Stan.

[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:55.260]
Cop it up. Wasn't that what he was always doing? Coping a big one up.

[01:19:55.900 --> 01:19:59.740]
I hate baseball 70. He's good. Not great that very 68.

[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:04.800]
Very of course rhymes with you're very. He's the greatest 56 as in queue 56.

[01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:09.080]
I hate him 45 and I hate this poll only 44 out of 80 to this.

[01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:12.500]
They like to pull today on Barry bonds because it's timely. It's right on target.

[01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:15.540]
He's in town. Don't forget we got that big Marlon game tonight.

[01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:17.380]
Any interest? There'll be a few people there.

[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:20.260]
And by the way, didn't normal can't say a couple of weeks ago.

[01:20:20.260 --> 01:20:22.660]
He wasn't going any more Marlon games because they're non-copus.

[01:20:22.780 --> 01:20:24.160]
We miss or something like that. Did he say that?

[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:26.440]
They can't compete. He's not going any more. Did he say that?

[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:27.600]
Thanks for what I heard you say.

[01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:29.700]
I reported that right here on this very important radio show.

[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:32.340]
And again full of craft man.

[01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:34.980]
Calls me from the ball game last night.

[01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:35.220]
Right.

[01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:40.580]
All I did was copy a mis-insipid idiotic email that I received from Joe Bell about the water Nazi.

[01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:43.920]
Which I thought I would share with my erstwhile age of the tourney and faggot.

[01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:46.700]
And he has to call me from the ballpark so I can hear all the sound.

[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:49.140]
And I care. I have to stop. He has to.

[01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:50.680]
I could hear the vendor. There was no crowd.

[01:20:51.020 --> 01:20:52.960]
He said that's why I can hear everybody because there's nobody here.

[01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:55.480]
Josh was there though. Were we in the press box?

[01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:56.340]
No, I wasn't.

[01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:57.760]
You were not? No, I wasn't.

[01:20:57.800 --> 01:21:02.200]
Probably they don't even let you enter anymore after the terrible things you said about Dave Van Boring and Rossia Foxy.

[01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:05.480]
After you talked about Dave Van Boring's bad hair piece.

[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:07.940]
This is Neil Rogers.

[01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:13.720]
This is 516-Q-A-M-A-M-A.

[01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:15.420]
Oh, the crap you can unwrap.

[01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:17.180]
All the slime all the time.

[01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:21.220]
Hey, Corrupt. By the way, I've been giving it some stuff.

[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:23.740]
Oh, what do you think it is?

[01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:27.940]
I know that me and you can do much better.

[01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:29.340]
Go in six to ten.

[01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:30.800]
And not in five.

[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:33.140]
A Gentile in the cranky do.

[01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:37.120]
I think we might be happy to get there.

[01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:42.380]
I think you really got out of your mind.

[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:46.200]
You got a happy, really bad strap on to sight.

[01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:48.500]
No chance I'll always show a joke.

[01:21:48.980 --> 01:21:52.020]
I'd rather die with the crappy together.

[01:21:54.580 --> 01:21:59.480]
Why, I'll help you know that I'm a big fucking Jew.

[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.200]
A Brooklyn high tall.

[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.860]
I've been wasted by everybody but you.

[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:09.040]
You're not my type.

[01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:12.660]
Me and Malt did that with love.

[01:22:12.660 --> 01:22:16.540]
No way that if we had a fight that you'd survive.

[01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:18.800]
Good one and here a Gentile.

[01:22:19.420 --> 01:22:20.320]
And for she might.

[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:22.100]
That's happy together.

[01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:27.680]
Oh, the door is door is door is door.

[01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:29.680]
Oh, the door is door is door.

[01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:31.480]
Oh, the door is door.

[01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:35.360]
Oh, the door is door is door.

[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:37.200]
Oh, the door is door.

[01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:39.240]
Oh, the door is door.

[01:22:41.220 --> 01:22:47.000]
But you and me for me is much better than 10 to 5.

[01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:50.680]
It's only right that I should get for sleep tonight.

[01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:54.580]
I think we might be happy to get there.

[01:22:56.420 --> 01:22:58.400]
Happy to get there.

[01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:02.500]
What can we be happy for?

[01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:05.040]
Oh, the door is door.

[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:10.660]
Oh, the door is door.

[01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:14.280]
Oh, the door is door.

[01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:39.540]
I better listen to that again.

[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:42.400]
It sounded to me like a little bit too tight, didn't it?

[01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:43.040]
What do you mean?

[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:43.800]
Listen.

[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:44.880]
Go on note down.

[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:45.580]
Yeah, let's stop.

[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:46.300]
Do that over here.

[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:48.240]
Okay, Mark, let's have something to do.

[01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:51.660]
Instead of going out and buying that book, thank you Liz for faxing this in.

[01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:57.640]
She says, I have read the book ruled by Secretly by Jim Mars, and my most of the book is

[01:23:57.640 --> 01:23:59.120]
very interesting and probably accurate.

[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:02.040]
It loses some credibility the last couple of chapters.

[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:07.140]
The author starts to write about the hidden history and origin of mankind, melding in his

[01:24:07.140 --> 01:24:12.260]
theories about reptilian flesh eating aliens and other created human beings as a slave race.

[01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:13.960]
I can send George the book if you like.

[01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:14.560]
You want the book?

[01:24:14.900 --> 01:24:15.220]
Yeah.

[01:24:15.660 --> 01:24:17.660]
Now yeah, go ahead and set it to George and keep it.

[01:24:17.700 --> 01:24:18.080]
I don't want it.

[01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:18.740]
I'm not going to read it.

[01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:19.900]
Thanks for saving me the money Liz.

[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:22.540]
I could give it to some poor homeless people on the streets.

[01:24:22.980 --> 01:24:25.180]
Spare some change, Mr. Havanai's day, eh?

[01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:26.560]
I could give it to some of them instead.

[01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:29.460]
We'll just take it out to Woodbine and lose it in about 10 seconds to come home again.

[01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:30.480]
Wow.

[01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:32.440]
Yeah, he's a little, you know.

[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:38.120]
He's interesting, but again, people I think everything in the world is a conspiracy and

[01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:40.960]
then this stuff about reptilian flesh eating.

[01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:44.100]
There's even worse than the Scientologist, I would say.

[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:45.800]
What do you say?

[01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:46.420]
I would.

[01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:48.560]
If there's any such thing as worse than them.

[01:24:49.180 --> 01:24:50.500]
Oh, and by the way, you got to correct something.

[01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:54.260]
The guy that called in last week or the week before about that story about the dress code

[01:24:54.260 --> 01:24:55.420]
in Iran, right?

[01:24:56.140 --> 01:24:57.860]
Gary Loop encounter punch rights.

[01:24:58.820 --> 01:25:02.300]
Now that I took it to the national post as a crappy newspaper tonight, right, Wing Piece

[01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:02.720]
of Garbage.

[01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:03.180]
That's right.

[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:07.880]
Now that Canada's national post has apologized for the misinformation article about Iran

[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:12.060]
and published on its front page last Friday, once it inquires to how this happened in the

[01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:16.040]
first place, the post had reported that on May 15, the Iranian parliament had passed

[01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:19.220]
the law establishing separate dress codes for religious minorities.

[01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:24.120]
Christians, Jews and zero asterians will have to adopt the stink color schemes to make

[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:25.380]
them identifiable in public.

[01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:29.720]
The new codes would enable Muslims to easily recognize non-Muslims so that they can

[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:33.280]
avoid shaking hands with them by mistake, thus becoming unclean.

[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:34.540]
This was absurd.

[01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:40.580]
The one Jewish member of the 190 member Iranian Majli, more esotama, among others refuted

[01:25:40.580 --> 01:25:42.780]
and noting the Iranians would never put up with such a law.

[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:46.460]
He added our enemy seek to create tension among religious minorities, what such news,

[01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:48.700]
and to exploit the situation of their benefit.

[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:53.540]
The legislature must surely count Iranian-American journalists on me or Tahiri author of the

[01:25:53.540 --> 01:25:57.220]
nonsense among these enemies, but what led to here to produce a sensationalistic piece

[01:25:57.220 --> 01:26:01.280]
drawing immediate damning comment from Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, US State Department

[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:05.240]
spokesman Sean McCormick, and Rabbi Marvin Hyer, Dean of the Simon Viesenthal Center

[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:05.840]
in Los Angeles.

[01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:10.420]
Tahiri is after all a matter of apparently impeccable journalistic credentials.

[01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:12.220]
You'll get joist.

[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:15.680]
He's been in the Middle East editor for London Sunday Times written for the telegraph,

[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:18.180]
their speagold, developed, and all these others.

[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:19.040]
Or your belt?

[01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:21.980]
He regularly comments El Mundo on CNN.

[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:25.860]
Quite a range of editors consider him competent, so I think it's unlikely as he's resulted

[01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:27.860]
from mere journalistic sloppiness.

[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:34.340]
Tahiri was also between 72 and 79 executive editor and chief up K-Han Iran's main daily

[01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:36.120]
newspaper, one of the Shah's regime.

[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:39.720]
Remember the Shah with his evaka used to torture people by yankin out their fingernails?

[01:26:40.140 --> 01:26:44.680]
He contributes to the Neocon National Review, and his speaking engagements are handled

[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:48.020]
by the Warm Mungering Neocon Venador Associates PR firm.

[01:26:48.340 --> 01:26:51.700]
He and these colleagues have repeatedly urged the US detective producer regime change

[01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:52.120]
in Iran.

[01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:56.140]
The Neocons, of course, have shown themselves more than willing to empty to employ the seat

[01:26:56.140 --> 01:26:57.620]
and building the case for military action.

[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:00.300]
It's part of their Straussian-Motus Apparandai.

[01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:04.040]
However, much of their intelligence about a rack disseminates through Douglas Pights office

[01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:08.020]
and special plans and media of sick offense like Judith Miller has been discredited.

[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:11.500]
They're plotting on with their strategy of vilifying yet another regime to build popular

[01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:12.660]
support for its overthrow.

[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:14.060]
And it goes on.

[01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:15.180]
It's on our website, by the way.

[01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:20.000]
The Jewish representative in the Iranian parliament who's been outspoken before is surely

[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.360]
on target when he suggests that some seek to exploit the situation of their benefit.

[01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:28.400]
They do so by exploiting ignorance, prejudice, fear, and gullibility.

[01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:32.740]
They sure now so much this information one has the sinking sense that however one tries

[01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:35.480]
to expose it, their plans in the short term will prevail.

[01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:40.520]
But those paying attention have to try and keep raising the slogan, stop the attack on

[01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:42.940]
Iran as fast as I can.

[01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:45.200]
824 votes.

[01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:47.040]
We don't even have to think about that thousand of you doing.

[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:47.720]
No.

[01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:49.260]
Not even some we got to worry about.

[01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:49.780]
Well, good.

[01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:50.900]
That's great.

[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:52.420]
We got so many other things to worry about.

[01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:55.700]
Although, have no fear because it's the water Nazis last day today.

[01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:59.620]
And that should take care of all our programming problems, all of our sales issues.

[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:03.960]
So you tell me that this guy came from North Carolina with a banjo on his knee and brought

[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:05.720]
Chris Jones along with him, right?

[01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:10.660]
Which is why our copy of Stabila in last year's Wonder Bread, which is why we had two of

[01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:14.940]
those feedback sheets of man and we had been feeding back since I'll give you some feedback.

[01:28:15.380 --> 01:28:15.760]
How's that?

[01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:17.200]
There's some feedbacks.

[01:28:17.460 --> 01:28:18.020]
Yeah, well, there you go.

[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:18.740]
You want to feed back?

[01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:19.240]
You got it.

[01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:20.740]
That's the only feedback we're going to get.

[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:25.460]
These guys talking again, I don't think they've ever really even been in a real radio station.

[01:28:25.780 --> 01:28:26.000]
You think?

[01:28:26.380 --> 01:28:26.780]
I don't know.

[01:28:27.180 --> 01:28:27.560]
My doubt.

[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:28.300]
Joyce hasn't.

[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:29.220]
Here's something.

[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:30.020]
Let me tell you again.

[01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:35.260]
If you sent Joyce 400 radios, she wouldn't even know where to start sticking them, okay?

[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:35.760]
Back to him.

[01:28:35.860 --> 01:28:36.880]
Much less worried to turn them on.

[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:37.800]
They'll draw her in that.

[01:28:38.340 --> 01:28:38.520]
Yeah.

[01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:39.040]
Okay.

[01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:41.280]
Yeah, here she's got a big crack problem.

[01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:41.820]
That's what I heard.

[01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:42.540]
This ended up.

[01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:43.800]
WDQYM.

[01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:44.060]
Hello.

[01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:45.880]
WDQYM.

[01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:46.120]
Hello.

[01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:48.200]
Hey, how you doing?

[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:48.880]
Okay.

[01:28:49.620 --> 01:28:50.340]
Any words?

[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:50.840]
No.

[01:28:50.940 --> 01:28:51.860]
I'm not that noise.

[01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:52.420]
Oh, yeah.

[01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:53.180]
We know who it is.

[01:28:53.540 --> 01:28:53.940]
WDQYM.

[01:28:54.020 --> 01:28:54.180]
Hello.

[01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:55.600]
You know something.

[01:28:55.940 --> 01:28:56.420]
It's a Neil.

[01:28:56.620 --> 01:28:58.440]
Sounded like he had his instrument vibrating there.

[01:28:58.500 --> 01:28:58.680]
Yes.

[01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:02.280]
There's a show named HBO called Back to VR.

[01:29:02.860 --> 01:29:03.680]
It's really good.

[01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:05.960]
He shows how our kids are being blown to pieces.

[01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:06.980]
Being butchered.

[01:29:07.060 --> 01:29:08.260]
The word you're looking for is butchered.

[01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:08.780]
Yeah.

[01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:10.940]
But it's really good, man.

[01:29:11.300 --> 01:29:11.760]
It's really good.

[01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:13.460]
I think you got a strong stomach.

[01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:14.120]
Okay, thanks.

[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:17.120]
Right after you watch faces of death, parts 1 through 100, you can watch that.

[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:21.800]
Yeah, Americans, all these innocent people being butchered and of course Afghanistan, they're

[01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:26.500]
pissed off at us because while those Humvees have a little bit of a mistake there, a little accident,

[01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:29.360]
climbed into a crowd, killing innocent people.

[01:29:29.460 --> 01:29:29.580]
Yes.

[01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:31.660]
And the Afghans are over-tracking.

[01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:33.980]
They're like going nuts because they've had enough already.

[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:36.860]
And the meantime, guess who's in should really, really run into the country.

[01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:38.340]
Enough, that's snooge from Unicale.

[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:39.780]
I'm the Hamid Karzai.

[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:41.840]
But the warlords are back at it again.

[01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:43.120]
Going eye-poppy.

[01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:44.120]
That's the number one export.

[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:45.760]
That's the big thing.

[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:47.200]
It keeps the country going again.

[01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:49.720]
And Afghanistan, what you think is going to get thought deep.

[01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:52.340]
And of course the Taliban, who we heard, were like long gone.

[01:29:52.340 --> 01:29:53.220]
And we took care of them.

[01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:54.760]
We got even what at the hour right.

[01:29:55.220 --> 01:29:57.540]
Now they're back in the mix, as they say, in the mix.

[01:29:57.680 --> 01:29:59.080]
Don't you love that expression in the mix?

[01:29:59.560 --> 01:29:59.560]

[01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:01.000]
Like you're making a cake or something.

[01:30:01.100 --> 01:30:02.060]
What do the Irish have to do with it?

[01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:04.140]
They're mixing it and then they're drinking it.

[01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:05.980]
Remember Tom Mix?

[01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:06.700]
Of course not.

[01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:07.520]
The cowboy.

[01:30:07.660 --> 01:30:08.480]
Cowboy Tom Mix.

[01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:11.940]
Now if you don't get to remember Tom Mix, it's gonna be telling me you remember...

[01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:13.460]
It's from those old movie told we were in here.

[01:30:13.460 --> 01:30:14.560]
What was the guy's name?

[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:15.560]
Not Bret Hart.

[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:15.960]
I remember.

[01:30:16.060 --> 01:30:16.460]
I was ready, Arnold.

[01:30:17.020 --> 01:30:18.640]
And he was Gene Autry.

[01:30:18.820 --> 01:30:19.100]
He's dead.

[01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:20.160]
Where Roger's?

[01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:20.560]
He's dead.

[01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:21.200]
Day 11.

[01:30:21.380 --> 01:30:21.960]
She's dead.

[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:23.460]
How about you even trigger his dead?

[01:30:24.060 --> 01:30:24.320]
God.

[01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:25.700]
And what about the lone stranger?

[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:26.260]
Is he dead?

[01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:27.340]
I'm sure he is.

[01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:28.440]
And what about Tonto?

[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:29.980]
He's probably at the Seminoles.

[01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:30.520]
Oh no.

[01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:31.640]
Playing him phony.

[01:30:31.740 --> 01:30:32.920]
There's airsoft slot machines.

[01:30:33.620 --> 01:30:34.820]
There's bad machines, man.

[01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:36.380]
Probably playing bingo with it.

[01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:37.260]
You know something?

[01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:39.840]
How many people have tried to explain that to me?

[01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:40.640]
How does things work?

[01:30:41.020 --> 01:30:41.480]
About 30.

[01:30:41.980 --> 01:30:43.040]
And I still don't get it.

[01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:44.540]
It's probably just as well.

[01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:45.800]
Oh, I wouldn't go there.

[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:47.540]
There's no chance to be going there.

[01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:50.340]
But now that I'm here, it's going to be after Labor Day

[01:30:50.340 --> 01:30:51.500]
when Gulfstream gets going.

[01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:53.160]
And Daniel Highlight is like...

[01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:54.240]
But it will be.

[01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:56.240]
And Pompatos is early next year for the slots.

[01:30:56.620 --> 01:30:57.400]
Early next year.

[01:30:58.140 --> 01:30:58.540]
2007.

[01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:02.140]
Who the hell can wait that long when you're waiting for a good machine, man?

[01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:03.000]
That's bad.

[01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:06.880]
This is the worst story in history.

[01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:11.480]
If you take the number of Americans who came home and bought the bags in Vietnam,

[01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:15.800]
and then add 25 of them, you got almost 60,000 dead bodies.

[01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:17.420]
Two wars.

[01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:19.160]
Two, and of course this isn't a war.

[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:19.740]
It's an occupation.

[01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:20.700]
What's going on right now?

[01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:22.000]
The KB-3 President World War.

[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:23.300]
We're not a war with Iraq.

[01:31:23.540 --> 01:31:24.340]
They didn't attack us.

[01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:27.000]
We're not fighting the Iraqi army.

[01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:28.600]
We invaded the country.

[01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:30.520]
We're occupying it and people are pissed off.

[01:31:31.020 --> 01:31:32.660]
And we're butchering all kinds of innocent people.

[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:33.400]
We'll get to that.

[01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:35.140]
You see this there about Henry Kissinger?

[01:31:35.700 --> 01:31:35.920]
No.

[01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:37.440]
Former, you didn't see this?

[01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:40.060]
Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.

[01:31:40.060 --> 01:31:45.580]
You're quietly acknowledged in China in 1972 that Washington could accept the communist takeover of South Vietnam

[01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:51.600]
if that evolved after withdrawal of US troops, even as the war to drive back the communist drag down with mounting deaths.

[01:31:52.020 --> 01:31:52.880]
No, it did not take that story.

[01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:56.520]
The late US President Richard Nixon's envoy told Chinese parents to join life.

[01:31:56.720 --> 01:32:02.320]
If we can live with a communist government in China, we ought to be able to accept one in Indochina.

[01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:06.520]
Kissinger's blunt remarks surfaced in a collection of papers from his years of diplomacy.

[01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:07.940]
We used that term loosely.

[01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:17.960]
Released Friday by George Washington University's National Security Archive, a collection was gathered from documents available to US government's national archives and obtained to the research groups declassification requests.

[01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:22.200]
Kissinger's comments appeared on the decency of the decency of the international press.

[01:32:23.700 --> 01:32:26.500]
The US was prepared to see communist takeover of Saigon.

[01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:30.220]
As long as it happened, after US troops departure to save face.

[01:32:32.140 --> 01:32:38.580]
After 57,000 kids came home in body bags and a war that nobody still has any idea what was really thought.

[01:32:38.580 --> 01:32:41.080]
And now we've got 2500 dead Americans over there.

[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:47.580]
Plus thousands and thousands and thousands of people would like missing limbs and eyes and all of these things.

[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:54.220]
Not to mention the tens and tens of thousands, probably over 100,000 dead Iraqis, which we still can understand where is the candy or the flowers.

[01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:56.680]
This is Neil Rogers.

[01:32:57.620 --> 01:33:00.660]
This is 5.62.8.

[01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:03.740]
This is Dick Jamie.

[01:33:04.020 --> 01:33:08.740]
I like to relax by having Mary Magdal and massage my balls while listening to the Neil Rogers 12th of 1 hour movie.

[01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:35.140]
It was an hit 37 years ago when women in the scene used to say,

[01:33:37.060 --> 01:33:39.440]
another Kennedy avoids a bus stop.

[01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:43.700]
Which side can you bus stop?

[01:33:44.180 --> 01:33:46.300]
Through an ambient down, many hit the town.

[01:33:46.580 --> 01:33:48.100]
Kennedy avoids a bus stop.

[01:33:48.620 --> 01:33:50.480]
Cox, I'm gonna drive your home.

[01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:52.380]
Another Kennedy avoids a bus stop.

[01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:56.660]
I am a trover.

[01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:03.080]
I saw the Ethel Kennedy on bio the other day.

[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:04.360]
Fabricity channel.

[01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:05.440]
Ethel Kennedy.

[01:34:06.380 --> 01:34:07.340]
Ethel M.

[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:09.560]
Who makes the chocolates in Vegas?

[01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:10.640]
You know Ethel Mertz.

[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:11.640]
Ethel Merman.

[01:34:12.420 --> 01:34:13.060]
Ethel Kennedy.

[01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:14.360]
Bobby Kennedy is widow.

[01:34:14.540 --> 01:34:15.400]
Remember Ethel Kennedy?

[01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:17.460]
What kind of plan are you living on, man?

[01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:19.440]
You know Ethel Kennedy?

[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:19.920]
No.

[01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:21.120]
Get out of here.

[01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:22.260]
You're so full of crap.

[01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:25.220]
I'm not even Josh knows who Ethel Kennedy is.

[01:34:25.420 --> 01:34:25.580]
Who?

[01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:31.680]
Anyway, it strikes me after having seen this long, arduous thing.

[01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:34.480]
I mean, it's generally speaking to Kennedy

[01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:36.360]
is a bunch of drunks and drug addicts.

[01:34:36.460 --> 01:34:37.820]
Not all of them, of course, but most.

[01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:39.000]
When you agree with that?

[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:40.000]
Okay.

[01:34:40.580 --> 01:34:42.960]
Maybe it's because that, you know, daddy was a bootleger.

[01:34:43.060 --> 01:34:45.160]
And of course, grandpa, although they say,

[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:45.940]
oh, that isn't true.

[01:34:46.100 --> 01:34:46.380]
Okay.

[01:34:46.820 --> 01:34:49.000]
And not only that, but I also a Nazi sympathizer.

[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:49.900]
Mm-hmm.

[01:34:50.340 --> 01:34:52.420]
Not that I don't love Ted Kennedy or JFK.

[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:54.360]
He was no George W.

[01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:55.640]
But then again, who is, you know?

[01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:58.500]
Although you can't say that in South Florida because then you get that,

[01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:02.980]
that crowd that hysterical, oh, bam, pigs, come out, come out, Kennedy.

[01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:05.700]
Yeah.

[01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:07.220]
I think that's your pig right over here.

[01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:07.620]
It's roasting.

[01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:10.660]
In fact, the pig is on the spit from yesterday's big barbecue.

[01:35:10.900 --> 01:35:12.780]
And it's still got that big red rubber ball in the mouth.

[01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:14.220]
The one that Joyce used to use.

[01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:18.560]
The road crash that triggered deadly anti-American riding in Kabul occurred

[01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:22.080]
because a military truck lost its brakes coming down the hill and

[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:23.180]
plugged into a line of cars.

[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:26.180]
The US military said today, this is today's excuse, couldn't afford a

[01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:29.920]
brake job chanting death to America riders on Monday,

[01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:33.160]
stolen the US convoy involved in the accident, then headed to the

[01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:36.100]
center of Kabul, ransacking offices of international aid groups and

[01:35:36.100 --> 01:35:39.000]
searching for foreigners, smoke billed from burning buildings.

[01:35:39.380 --> 01:35:41.080]
Death to America, we hate you.

[01:35:41.220 --> 01:35:41.640]
They were screaming.

[01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:42.400]
Did you see those clips?

[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:43.000]
No.

[01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:45.040]
If you would have been watching, what's his name?

[01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:45.480]
They're on ABC.

[01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:47.280]
I can't even think of what his name is anymore.

[01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:49.420]
The guy from Good Morning America.

[01:35:49.820 --> 01:35:51.500]
Oh, Charlie Gibbon.

[01:35:51.580 --> 01:35:52.740]
Charlie Gibbon, he gives him.

[01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:54.280]
He is so boring.

[01:35:54.660 --> 01:35:59.800]
I'm telling you, he's like David Hartman on two cups of coffee.

[01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:00.820]
How do you caffeinated?

[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:02.640]
That's a good melody.

[01:36:03.020 --> 01:36:03.260]
Yeah.

[01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:06.700]
He's just a couple of steps less coma-inducing than David Hartman.

[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:10.880]
ABC has always found the blandest, the most boring, just like that

[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:12.640]
George Step on Top of Us on this week.

[01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:15.020]
You know, just because David Brinkley's dead.

[01:36:15.020 --> 01:36:17.940]
You know, when they took David off the air that was before he had that fire in the house.

[01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:18.960]
Remember that it was kind of sad.

[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:23.140]
When David's eyeballs kept popping out of his sock and during the show and falling on his cheek,

[01:36:23.260 --> 01:36:25.640]
that's when they decided he was just old enough to get him off the air already.

[01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:29.960]
Not to mention, of course, the fact that he was showing for that what's that company that makes the

[01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:32.040]
agricultural stuff.

[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:33.440]
And that was that crap all over the place.

[01:36:33.740 --> 01:36:33.740]

[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:34.320]
No.

[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:38.040]
Next, you're going to be saying that the guy with a hair who's also dead.

[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:39.400]
Herbal, herbal life.

[01:36:39.740 --> 01:36:39.940]
No.

[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:41.360]
Anywhere I'll think of it.

[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:43.640]
The death toll from the unrest rose to 11.

[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:47.340]
Most of them from gunshot wounds according to three city hospitals, more than 100 people wounded.

[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:49.980]
This is in Kabul where everything is under control.

[01:36:50.020 --> 01:36:56.140]
Not where that pimped that stooge, homid carzyze supposedly in charge, where that schmata that he wears.

[01:36:56.460 --> 01:36:59.220]
And that thing he wears on his head to me looks like a whoside chaco.

[01:37:00.020 --> 01:37:02.400]
Maybe he really knew the great Ahmed Khan.

[01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:04.800]
What is this thing that you just fashed me?

[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:07.080]
Oh, Max Schumacher, this is from network.

[01:37:07.420 --> 01:37:08.940]
Well, but I read it, Josh, look at him said.

[01:37:08.940 --> 01:37:12.300]
There's a comparing network to us some recent news stories.

[01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:13.000]
It's not a cute.

[01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:15.020]
Oh, Max Schumacher.

[01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:21.720]
We could make a series of it, suicide of the week, all hell, why limit ourselves execution of the week, how our deal terrorist of the week.

[01:37:22.100 --> 01:37:24.340]
I love that scene where they're just pie-eyed during the bar.

[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:26.300]
Schumacher, I love it.

[01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:34.300]
Suicide, assassinations, mad bombers, mafia hitmen, automobile smash ups, the death hour, a great Sunday night show for the whole family.

[01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:41.520]
From a press release announcing A&E's pilot episode of Two Reality shows about the most feared topic of all, the end of a human life.

[01:37:41.980 --> 01:37:46.700]
A&E isn't development with two distinct programs that deal with the overreaching themes of death and dying.

[01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:48.760]
Last request in six months.

[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:54.640]
A&E's spokesman Daniel Silberman, these shows are still just pilots, but both of them are celebrations of life.

[01:37:54.940 --> 01:37:57.180]
Neither of them are exploited. They are very serious programs.

[01:37:57.480 --> 01:38:00.080]
Yeah, the death of the awake, yeah, Max Schumacher had it right.

[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:06.220]
One of the great movies of all time, and anybody who tells me that they didn't like it if he'll sleep during the movie, is just a turd.

[01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:09.360]
Okay, with all due respect, or at least the commie.

[01:38:09.820 --> 01:38:10.840]
No, just a turd.

[01:38:11.300 --> 01:38:14.080]
How could anybody not know that that's one of the most especially?

[01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:18.000]
I'm especially mad at hell, and I don't think it's anything wrong.

[01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:26.660]
Which is what we were, especially in South Florida where we threw up watching Channel 7 so many times, where we've seen the circus that they've taken what it's supposed to be news.

[01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:29.620]
In fact, one of the stories I got here, where the hell is it?

[01:38:30.580 --> 01:38:34.040]
You know, my pile, I got a big pile, I got a big pile every day, and I got real piles.

[01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:37.800]
Iraq Veterans wonder about a public obsessed by American Idol.

[01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:40.040]
Oh, amen, amen, sister.

[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:41.200]
Hallelujah.

[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:43.980]
American Idol, my ass.

[01:38:44.820 --> 01:38:45.460]
858 votes.

[01:38:45.620 --> 01:38:49.620]
I guess I better keep banging on it, because if we don't get to the thousand, I'm going to be really pissed off.

[01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:50.340]
It'll be my fault.

[01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:52.380]
I always blame Josh for not leaning on it.

[01:38:52.740 --> 01:38:52.960]
Hhh!

[01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:54.440]
Duff told me the same thing.

[01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:58.300]
858 votes on the very bonds, Paul. It's kind of a limited thing, you know.

[01:38:58.420 --> 01:39:02.420]
Although, only a 48-year hit this poll. That's pretty low number. It's on the bottom.

[01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:04.560]
It's like that trowel on the bottom, yogurt.

[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:07.740]
It's haven't played that in a long time, you know what?

[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:09.000]
Trowel on the bottom.

[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:14.360]
Tired of the same old flavors of yogurt, cherry, strawberry, banana, peach, blueberry.

[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:20.160]
Well, look out, taste buds. Prepare yourself palette for crudeson's Trowel on the bottom yogurt.

[01:39:20.300 --> 01:39:23.360]
Trowel on the bottom, fresh water. Trowel on the bottom.

[01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:30.300]
Trowel on the bottom. Trowel on the bottom. Trowel on the bottom. Trowel on the bottom. Trowel on the bottom.

[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:53.280]
Trowel on the bottom. Trowel on the bottom. Trowel on the bottom. Trowel on the bottom. Trowel on the bottom.

[01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:21.180]
Trowel on the bottom. Trowel on the bottom. Trowel on the bottom. Trowel on the bottom.

[01:40:21.180 --> 01:40:21.380]
Trowel on the bottom. Trowel on the bottom. Trowel on the bottom. Trowel on the bottom. Trowel on the bottom.

[01:40:21.380 --> 01:40:23.260]
Trowel on the bottom. Trowel on the bottom. Trowel on the bottom. Trowel on the bottom. Trowel on the bottom.

[01:40:23.260 --> 01:40:28.240]
No, we couldn't find his number. No. Wait until you hear this, the column.

[01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:33.080]
Peter Curth, who has his own website, PeterCurth.com. Is that the food guy? No.

[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:37.420]
George and Tony Sidner and Trey K.I.L.L.I.N.G.

[01:40:38.020 --> 01:40:42.280]
Did you like the headline? That's cute. You can imagine the depth of my emotion.

[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:47.100]
I'm sure when I read about the joint press conference given to Washington last week by a fearless viewer, George W. Bush,

[01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:52.600]
and his chief ally and co-conspirator in the warrant terror, British Prime Minister, and Quiky and Quisely and Tony Blair.

[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:55.800]
Fearless, fearless and Quiky and Quisely. Oh, you've got to love this.

[01:40:56.300 --> 01:41:00.600]
Blair wasn't watched in for what he called talks with the President. Imagine how much fun those must be.

[01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:04.800]
And after we're facing reporters who appeared dismayed in tongue-tied for the New York Times.

[01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:09.840]
But why wouldn't he? Thanks largely to the ongoing starter in Iraq, bushes sagging approval ratings,

[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:14.100]
or Blair's sagging approval ratings among British voters are even more awful than bushes are here.

[01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:19.880]
Which is to say, in Britspeak, they're very awful indeed and our own lingo that they're lousy. They stink.

[01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:23.140]
Bush's favorable ratings are now in the 30% range.

[01:41:23.180 --> 01:41:24.000]
Not 30, man.

[01:41:24.140 --> 01:41:32.380]
Blair's clocking at a mere 26%. If I may lapse for a moment in a TV vernacular and language of advertisements aimed at teenage boys, these numbers really suck.

[01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:38.200]
US political commentators repeatedly voiced wonder at a world leader with worse ratings than George Bush said the Guardian of London.

[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:45.060]
The Guardian further observed that for once Bush had to come to the Prime Minister's verbal rescue in the face of the skepticism of the British press corps,

[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:50.200]
it as much as Blair looked very weary and under pressure, and as if he would have preferred to be someplace else.

[01:41:50.780 --> 01:41:57.460]
The British have long been mystified by the tenacity with which Blair clings to a special relationship with a dunder-headed mass killer like Bush.

[01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:05.840]
But unlike the American counterpart last week, the British media generally refrain from faunting swooning and carrying on about these subdued repentant almos remorseful atmosphere

[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:08.900]
and watched in the latest Bush and Blair dog in Pony show.

[01:42:09.340 --> 01:42:14.300]
By the way, that whole thing was orchestrated and written ahead of time that whole remorseful, that whole big argument.

[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:17.320]
I read that story. Yeah, on our website. Yes, I did.

[01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:23.540]
The news conference in the formal setting in the Eastern was notable for the contrite tone of both leaders, the triumph of fame with Duce Illumny,

[01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:30.280]
and in that unusual admission of a personal mistake, Mr. Bush said he regretted challenging insurgents that a man could bring it on in 2003,

[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:33.700]
and said the same about her statement that he wanted or some of it a lot in debt or alive.

[01:42:33.700 --> 01:42:39.460]
To the amazement of the American press, double confess that this was the kind of tough talk, you know, that sent a wrong message to people.

[01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:44.160]
I learned some lessons about expressing myself, maybe a little more sophisticated manner, said your president.

[01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:50.560]
Abu Gharr, right here like that. Right. So sophisticated as Bush become expressing himself, when asked what he'd miss about Tony Blair,

[01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:54.720]
when the British people finally given the boot he answered, I'll miss those red ties. That's what almos.

[01:42:55.300 --> 01:43:01.080]
As the Guardian noted, this was on par with Bush's first record of comment about Blair when the minute camp David had an assignment in February 2001,

[01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:06.840]
and Bush was pressed to explain what he thought they might have in common. Well, he said we both use Kulge toothpaste.

[01:43:07.380 --> 01:43:14.280]
Ha ha, what a card our president is. CBS News marveled at Bush's unusual burst of candor when he mentioned the torture of prisoners at Baghdad.

[01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:18.460]
Abu Gharr, prison as the America is military, a big is military mistake in Iraq.

[01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:27.220]
ABC declared that some of the bull talk we once heard is gone, but neither Bush norbler gave the slightest sound the intent to change the immutual assured course of destruction in Iraq and across the Middle East.

[01:43:27.220 --> 01:43:34.860]
On the contrary, after lauding Blair as a man of resolve and vision encouraged Bush made a point in saying that sophisticated and the way he has,

[01:43:35.220 --> 01:43:39.720]
the amazing things about dealing with Prime Minister Blair is he never wants to be said to be on the phone.

[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:45.600]
We better change our tactics because of the political opinions, you know. Yeah George, we know that you're a liar in a fraud,

[01:43:45.740 --> 01:43:52.160]
but on a legitimate leg to stand on in the Iraq fiasco. And the only reason you try to now blare on Thursday is because he's still popular in the West and you aren't.

[01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:58.480]
In other words, because the pulls you pretended to stay in our down, down, down Americans are always impressed by British accent.

[01:43:58.820 --> 01:44:04.700]
He's like detecting some kind of gravity and if that's missing saying the phony twang of a Connecticut Yankee from Crawford, Texas.

[01:44:05.100 --> 01:44:07.840]
And you need Tony Blair's endorsement right now in order to continue the killing.

[01:44:08.260 --> 01:44:15.500]
What blare gets out of it, I can't say certainly not increased popularity in his own country where your press conference had to be televised in the middle of the night on cable no less,

[01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:21.380]
to minimize the political fallout. But I noticed George again that after you sang blare's praises then offered to buy him dinner.

[01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:26.560]
Ha ha again. He didn't return the compliment. Maybe none of this would bother me so much of work for Memorial Day weekend.

[01:44:26.740 --> 01:44:30.600]
And I hadn't seen the faces of nine dead vermoners staring out on the front page on Sunday's local daily.

[01:44:31.140 --> 01:44:34.760]
Nine vermoners you're killing in the last year in the service of your ego and your folly.

[01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:39.660]
No question that the Iraq war has, you know, created a sense of consternation here in America you remarked.

[01:44:39.660 --> 01:44:45.060]
I mean when you turn on your TV screen and see innocent people die day in and day out it affects the mentality of our country.

[01:44:45.260 --> 01:44:49.060]
I can understand why the American people are troubled by the war in Iraq. I understand that.

[01:44:49.300 --> 01:44:51.500]
But you don't George, you don't and you never will.

[01:44:52.060 --> 01:44:56.840]
It's kind of like the end of my conversation with Clara Bell on Friday. We said, oh yeah, I understand.

[01:44:57.080 --> 01:45:02.940]
I said, you don't Joe and you never will. You know what I was when I said that absolutely correct. Amen.

[01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:03.720]
Absolutely.

[01:45:05.060 --> 01:45:08.920]
875 on a pole where inching or crawling our way toward that thousand votes by two o'clock.

[01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:15.940]
We're going to do it. If it's the last and thing we do, we got to me. This is not a, this is a no brainer, right? Oh yeah.

[01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:21.480]
Easy. It's like taking an extra step off the top of the Empire State Building say oops and have it along.

[01:45:21.740 --> 01:45:26.600]
No brainer. It's kind of like Eric Clapton's kid flying out the window and we thought it was Superman.

[01:45:27.380 --> 01:45:32.280]
1213 at 560 WDQM being outdoors a lot in South Florida means you really need some comfortable shoes.

[01:45:32.500 --> 01:45:39.900]
So the only place to take your tutsis is brandy shoes and pumpy no beach. Brandy's carries all your major top brands like four shine.

[01:45:40.140 --> 01:45:44.960]
Echo, my fistill rock for hush puppies, new balance, tons of other name brands and all sizes for men and women.

[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:52.040]
And they even carry wide wits and hard to find sizes. If you have really bizarre feet, I was going to say, effed up feet that would be bad.

[01:45:52.040 --> 01:45:55.880]
It'll set up brandy shoes is the largest independent shoe retailer in all South Florida.

[01:45:56.020 --> 01:46:00.260]
When you see the fabulous selection of value, you always get a brandy's to see why I've been telling you for years.

[01:46:00.260 --> 01:46:03.120]
This is the place to take your feet. Go see our good buddy Arnie.

[01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:07.960]
He'll make sure he gets ready for the right fitting shoes for your feet at the right price every time.

[01:46:08.340 --> 01:46:12.620]
And I like those department stores where you have to wait for everybody to get weighted on and then whatever style you pick out.

[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:18.560]
Oh, sorry, I don't have that in your size. You know they got to wait for you at Brandy's because the only thing they do at Brandy's is shoes.

[01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:22.420]
So you don't have to worry about size selection service or those unbeatable prices.

[01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:27.980]
Brandy's shoes you'll find them at 1290 North Federal Highway in Poppano Beach between Atlantic and Copaz on the East Side.

[01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:57.000]
This is the new Roger is a local board. This is 5.60 QA.

[01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:01.460]

Cratch off Saturdays. The mullet will be handing us scratch off cards at every Saturday home game for your chance to win.

[01:47:07.540 --> 01:47:13.000]
In Atlantic's opening day 276 Lannogarde autograph by Juve Charity.

There are 100 InstaWare so keep listening to QA.M. for your chance to win Marles' tickets and scratch off cards.

[01:47:19.380 --> 01:47:25.820]
One InstaWare could be used scratch off Saturdays from the Marles at 5.60 QA.M.

[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:27.460]
Here's for the grandma.

[01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:35.560]
She has got militant. She has put on a veil and slapped on some explosives and is looking for someplace to detonate it.

[01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:37.580]
But tell toys. It refuses to use.

[01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:42.160]
Jehard Barbie. Jehard Barbie comes with her own toy or the pickup truck.

[01:47:42.260 --> 01:47:44.060]
Which she is not allowed to be driving.

[01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:49.240]
Several traditional burgers and the plans to blow up an embassy or artboard market.

[01:47:49.900 --> 01:47:55.440]
You are making the choice. Jehard Barbie comes to believe with detonating device they may or may not work.

[01:47:55.660 --> 01:48:00.200]
Just like that or anyone. So get Jehard Barbie today and start planning your own Jehard.

[01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:06.040]
Jehard Barbie. I'm sailant all bagged back toy stores now. Just in time for the infidel holiday season.

[01:48:06.940 --> 01:48:11.440]
From 19 at 5.60 WQM we got that 8th London or the world.

[01:48:11.620 --> 01:48:16.800]
Geldig Yeldstein at 2 o'clock this afternoon and you're probably wondering what's the, why is he the wonder?

[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:18.520]
Because we all wonder how he can be on the air.

[01:48:19.100 --> 01:48:23.760]
May a dog at 4 and in a Marlon crap Marlon's in the Giants and Eddie K. follows the baseball game.

[01:48:24.220 --> 01:48:26.600]
Memorial day. Holiday. All the kids are out of school.

[01:48:27.180 --> 01:48:29.280]
Couldn't have been more than 110 degrees in the shade.

[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:34.700]
7,683 announced. Very bonds just a break in Babe Ruth 714 on Sunday.

[01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:41.180]
Fresh off of that coming into town with all the big hoopla on celebration and we get about 2000 people out there at the ballpark.

[01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:43.520]
And they want us to build a stadium. Hey David.

[01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:48.280]
That's what I say to you. And all the idiots in the newspapers like Red Code Text and all that one.

[01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:54.000]
Oh, we got to build a Marlon's in the stadium. Right. Sure. Sure work in Pittsburgh, didn't it?

[01:48:54.380 --> 01:48:57.700]
Look at all the extra money they made. So they put together a hell of a contending team.

[01:48:57.700 --> 01:49:00.900]
Right. Only the Marlins in the National League have a worst record than the Pirates.

[01:49:01.140 --> 01:49:06.340]
They don't draw flies. Even if they had gigantic manure piles all over the field, they couldn't draw flies to it.

[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:10.660]
Am I right, Josh? You are right. They got a new stadium. How they doing?

[01:49:11.180 --> 01:49:15.820]
El Stinco. Marie Coco. I wonder if she's kind of James Coco. Hey Jimmy.

[01:49:16.060 --> 01:49:18.280]
You're fairy. Now she's a communist for the Washington Post.

[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:23.040]
She says Iraq veterans wonder about a public obsessed by American idol.

[01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:28.540]
For Jeremy Brusar, there was the drama of sexual assault allegations against NBA star Kobe Bryant.

[01:49:29.100 --> 01:49:35.880]
And the buzz over the TV series Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. For rich Murphy, it was the media's fixation with Britney Spears and Michael Jackson.

[01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:39.440]
And the enduring annoyance of the American public's obsession with American idol.

[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:45.240]
When Paul Reikoff returned from battle in Iraq, he discovered a citizenry uninterested in debating the correctness of the conflict.

[01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:51.660]
Or even how its course affected those who put their lives online. And steady found that people were obsessed with Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction.

[01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:56.000]
Now it's Brangelina and a horse with a broken legs is right.

[01:49:56.160 --> 01:50:02.500]
Who upstarted Iraq and Afghanistan veterans of America, which calls itself the largest veterans group for those who served in America's latest work.

[01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:07.220]
This is the most important story of your life. This is where it's at.

[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:14.820]
This horse with a broken leg is driving me crazy. Right, coughs and an interview with her in the injured Kentucky beer me winner Barbara.

[01:50:14.820 --> 01:50:20.280]
You come back from a war zone and this is what you see over and over and over again.

[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:26.180]
See what I'm saying? This is where it's at. The media and an all-too-willing American public.

[01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:31.380]
And I don't forget to chicken a Rubberman. Oh, yeah, my favorite dish. Don't forget about that bitch. It's better than paella.

[01:50:31.700 --> 01:50:35.940]
She's like to look up for us. She slips with her fishes. I didn't know there was fish in that dish, too.

[01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:43.840]
If there's a point of disagreement among America's newest veterans, it seems to be that Americans at large are detached and disconnected from the very idea that the nation is at war.

[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:51.380]
True support for the Iraq conflict has ev'ed as the war has gone from being seen as a triumph of shock and awe to a terrifying descendant of civil mayhem.

[01:50:51.820 --> 01:50:59.980]
Mayhem murdered in bloodshed. True, there are those who fiercely debate whether you as troops should be pulled out immediately, should be drawn down on by the way they just sent 1500 more troops.

[01:51:00.420 --> 01:51:03.560]
They're not drawing down anything. Just in 1500 more because it's chaos.

[01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:04.620]
Fresh meat.

[01:51:05.220 --> 01:51:08.960]
Should be drawn down according to a timetable or rather the military commitment should be open-ended.

[01:51:08.960 --> 01:51:12.400]
But these conversations seem to echo only in certain corners of society.

[01:51:12.820 --> 01:51:18.300]
No more than a million servicemen and women have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan since these military operations began in 2001.

[01:51:18.740 --> 01:51:22.100]
The all-volunteer military means that few Americans actually know someone who has served.

[01:51:22.460 --> 01:51:27.440]
It is profoundly unlike World War II when a generation of youth saw action or play the role in the war effort.

[01:51:27.700 --> 01:51:36.940]
Who could not be less likely at norm when the drag filled these seemingly endless need for fresh soldiers and filled the streets at home with protesters and filled the body bags with 57,000 dead Americans.

[01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:42.860]
Henry Kissinger said, well, if we could have got it, that article just makes me sick.

[01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:46.120]
How come he's not on death row? That Nazi bastard.

[01:51:46.860 --> 01:51:49.860]
Most people in America don't know anyone who's fought in Iraq said, right, Kup?

[01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:53.520]
It's like a TV show they watched and they switch back to desperate housewives.

[01:51:54.080 --> 01:52:02.260]
Roussard, now I am Howard University law student, told me, suppose that this on the attachment is better than what his father endured when he arrived at the Seattle Airport first from a service in Vietnam.

[01:52:02.260 --> 01:52:05.760]
This guy runs up to him and spits in his face in the house, baby killer.

[01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:11.920]
His own homecoming in late 2003 before would become clear that the Iraq conflict was turning into a drone out of the guerrilla war.

[01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:17.180]
Was marked instead by a pro-fuckery expression of thank you for your service and few questions about the war itself.

[01:52:17.700 --> 01:52:23.420]
To me, I had a hard time adjusting because people didn't want to talk to me about the war. They wanted to talk about Kobe Bryant, Roussard said.

[01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:29.680]
The public disengagement worries these veterans not so much because they agree on what should be done in Iraq now.

[01:52:29.860 --> 01:52:32.260]
They don't, but because the nation seems not to notice them.

[01:52:32.620 --> 01:52:35.820]
The Veterans Administration is grossly underfunded according to most independent estimates.

[01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:39.740]
It is hard-pressed to meet even the needs of aging WW2 and Vietnam veterans.

[01:52:40.140 --> 01:52:45.060]
Today's all-volunteer military often drives recruits among those with few opportunities for education and economic advancement.

[01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:48.560]
And many veterans are discharged without the skills needed for civilian employment.

[01:52:49.100 --> 01:52:52.480]
Mental health problems are being documented among returning troops at an alarming rate.

[01:52:52.480 --> 01:52:57.860]
Estimates of the number of returning Iraq and Afghan vets who are already in the homeless range from two to four hundred.

[01:52:58.360 --> 01:53:01.420]
According to Cheryl Beversdorf, for the national coalition for homeless veterans.

[01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:05.060]
But she cautioned the numbers likely to grow over time as it did for Vietnam veterans.

[01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:07.680]
Whose long-term adjustment problems weren't immediately apparent.

[01:53:08.180 --> 01:53:12.900]
Vietnam vets took eight to twelve years before they really became what we call hardcore homeless, she says.

[01:53:13.560 --> 01:53:20.600]
Memorial Day came with most Americans more eager for picnics in department store sales than for patriotic parades and an irreversible cultural drift.

[01:53:21.080 --> 01:53:26.120]
Murphy returned from Iraq in August 2004 and said he probably spent spend the day with baseball and burgers.

[01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:28.020]
I'm not a big flag waiver, he said.

[01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:33.980]
In truth, there are already enough cars with flag decals and yellow ribbon magnets, boasting support for troops.

[01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:39.160]
It's past time to abandon the easy symbol for the hard work of civic engagement, she says.

[01:53:39.440 --> 01:53:42.580]
Nice going where you go girl, although you're farting into a wind storm honey.

[01:53:43.560 --> 01:53:48.400]
You're farting into a big wild cyclone, into a tsunami mommy, silently at hope.

[01:53:48.900 --> 01:53:55.340]
Now loud and clear, loud enough so that joy is over there and now Fort Myers can hear it and Naples, whoever she's hanging it up, that bitch.

[01:53:55.960 --> 01:53:58.860]
The one that's determined to help make sure that they show fails.

[01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:06.700]
It's really something when you got the corporate legal and the program director both doing whatever they can to their power to try to throw a monkey wrench into works.

[01:54:07.100 --> 01:54:11.940]
And by the way, the next time you let that jackass come in there in the morning, I'm going to get up and walk out and I'm not coming back.

[01:54:12.660 --> 01:54:14.140]
Alright, I'll lock the door.

[01:54:14.140 --> 01:54:17.520]
No, I'm just telling you, you saw him coming in there this morning.

[01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:18.540]
What did I tell you about him?

[01:54:18.760 --> 01:54:23.460]
I know what you said, but you know what I want to be in the say, I don't want to be in the presence of that creature.

[01:54:23.560 --> 01:54:41.680]
Okay, that sports nerd who lies and makes up stories about how you're a liar and you make up stories about how the board and the whole studio keeps getting discombobulated every time they put one of their stupid ass ball games on 1360 every time they farm it out and they put those goop balls in there turning everything into non-workable mode so that

[01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:44.540]
you can make sure when you come in the next morning, nothing works for half an hour.

[01:54:45.240 --> 01:54:50.900]
If we like some coming to your home and like taking apart all the parts of the house and then every day you have to put it back together again.

[01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:53.740]
After I'll start to get a little bit ponderous, okay?

[01:54:54.460 --> 01:54:56.040]
But you just make those things up to your...

[01:54:56.040 --> 01:54:56.600]
I know, I know.

[01:54:56.920 --> 01:55:01.880]
Just like Tommy just put it up that he didn't have nothing to do that day that he volunteered to come in and help us out when you were out sick.

[01:55:02.340 --> 01:55:04.420]
And I was out sick and everybody was sick as a dog.

[01:55:04.420 --> 01:55:08.760]
You know something? And yet in spite of that, not to pet ourselves on the back, but I'll do it anyway.

[01:55:09.060 --> 01:55:10.820]
In spite of that, we got a show on the year of E.D.A.

[01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:11.940]
Okay, and a pretty damn good one.

[01:55:12.180 --> 01:55:12.980]
We did just fine.

[01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:14.980]
Just ask John, he'll tell you.

[01:55:15.400 --> 01:55:17.720]
He was rescuing off during those shows all the one day he did.

[01:55:18.060 --> 01:55:18.440]
Right, right.

[01:55:19.060 --> 01:55:21.280]
No, because his brother was like killing people or something.

[01:55:21.620 --> 01:55:23.660]
Whatever happened with that, I don't want to talk about that.

[01:55:23.980 --> 01:55:25.080]
I don't think we want to talk about that.

[01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:26.800]
I mean, but it was okay, right?

[01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:28.160]
It's okay now.

[01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:29.420]
You're talking about...

[01:55:30.020 --> 01:55:31.280]
What do you mean, what am I talking about?

[01:55:31.420 --> 01:55:33.720]
Why don't we just pretend it's another story that I made up?

[01:55:33.720 --> 01:55:35.240]
Oh, yeah, that's right.

[01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:40.000]
There goes George again.

[01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:41.000]
I love this.

[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:42.380]
Why are you two Roger?

[01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:43.160]
Double maker.

[01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:43.920]
That's right.

[01:55:44.260 --> 01:55:45.200]
He's 560.

[01:55:45.260 --> 01:55:45.780]
I'll put it away.

[01:55:48.300 --> 01:55:48.700]
Yeah.

[01:55:48.980 --> 01:55:49.460]
One moment please.

[01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:50.380]
Uh-oh.

[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:51.300]
One other moment please.

[01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:52.040]
I'm glad I did.

A weird unbox.

[01:56:11.220 --> 01:56:13.900]
It's the long awaited conclusion of American Idol.

[01:56:14.180 --> 01:56:16.820]
George Bush versus Dick Cheney.

[01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:19.060]
I ought to be singing on American Idol.

[01:56:20.540 --> 01:56:22.740]
This guy is called the Kurt and Chuck, my friend.

[01:56:23.680 --> 01:56:25.300]
We move side with the players.

[01:56:25.840 --> 01:56:26.460]
Come on in and back.

[01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:28.340]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, generation.

[01:56:29.540 --> 01:56:31.840]
Before we grow old, talking about...

[01:56:32.940 --> 01:56:38.980]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

[01:56:38.980 --> 01:56:39.360]
Here we go.

[01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:40.020]
What do you think of me?

[01:56:40.300 --> 01:56:42.080]
You're the worst guitar in the world.

[01:56:42.300 --> 01:56:44.320]
But I'm the Decider and I decide what is best.

[01:56:44.540 --> 01:56:46.380]
I have the executioner and the conclusion

[01:56:46.380 --> 01:56:48.920]
of American Idol's tonight on Fox.

[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:06.200]
I'm going to tear it into a million pieces. I can't wait. Let's see how many pages here one two three

[01:57:06.940 --> 01:57:12.700]
Quattro is in Susie Quattro. You want to hear the headline? All right. Stractor's self in real tight

[01:57:12.700 --> 01:57:15.320]
I don't think I have stories about George's brother, but all right

Holloway case a mystery after a year of catch and release

[01:57:19.380 --> 01:57:21.880]
And it's got a picture of Natalie Holloway right here

[01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:27.320]
And you know, I would say how I would describe her in one word. Meas. That's the word excellent. Meas kite

[01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:33.480]
A year has passed since Natalie and Holloway accompanied by three young men walk out of a nightclub at a rubah into oblivion a rubah

[01:57:33.480 --> 01:57:34.480]
Which rhymes with chew?

[01:57:35.140 --> 01:57:37.000]
And it goes down, but it would put about

[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:41.720]
Bapapapa. And so this means read across me will be breathless although it's kind of hard to tell when she's breathless

[01:57:43.040 --> 01:57:47.600]
She's always she just can't speak she'll be all over this like stink on

[01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:55.560]
Greg and it goes on and on and there the whole story again and her mother and your mama and this one

[01:57:55.560 --> 01:58:02.980]
Oh my god Natalie Holloway my S just like that's the right this red man. That's the most important thing in history right there

[01:58:04.180 --> 01:58:11.440]
There isn't one person who signed up who volunteered to be an emulitary who wanted to be used as as human carnage

[01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:13.540]
It didn't

[01:58:13.540 --> 01:58:19.220]
No, they did not hold it what they signed up. That's exactly what they're being used for human for your father for your father

[01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:23.140]
924 votes on a poll we're gonna make that thousand easy maybe this hour

You know how the calls come like in little bunches here in there like I like that

[01:58:26.660 --> 01:58:32.780]
It's a bit of a new format, huh like in little spurts. Yeah, you guys can relate to that little spurts especially

[01:58:33.860 --> 01:58:38.020]

I was gonna go and get that book but I'm not now that was I mean

[01:58:41.320 --> 01:58:46.180]
See this is the problem. It's like Natalie no hair, you know before she got chopped up in little pieces

[01:58:46.180 --> 01:58:48.760]
I had around my show. I don't know Zidian times

[01:58:48.760 --> 01:58:54.360]
But third man and the problem with her that if she was just as ridiculous as the religion is that she was ripping an ass

[01:58:54.360 --> 01:58:58.600]
I mean everything she said was true, but she was just such a an outrageous person, you know

[01:58:59.340 --> 01:59:01.880]
Not to mention facts. You made me look like a midget

[01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:02.960]
Logic

[01:59:03.380 --> 01:59:05.220]
Yeah, like my grandma used to say I'm midget

[01:59:06.740 --> 01:59:14.120]
That's what she said. Okay. It's like pop-eye. I'm midget. Okay. Okay. Chris says to get more information on the bad ministry

[01:59:44.120 --> 01:59:46.520]
I see mercy

[01:59:46.520 --> 01:59:49.340]

[02:00:57.900 --> 02:01:02.340]
They're all the sellouts were in suits, you know, that's right responsible for all this

[02:01:03.520 --> 02:01:08.860]
That's absolutely correct sir. They've all become establishment shields is what they have they were indifferent

[02:01:08.860 --> 02:01:13.060]
They're worried about they're more worried about who's gonna be on good morning American who's gonna be doing the news on ABC

[02:01:13.060 --> 02:01:18.880]
And just like that things said who's gonna win on American Idol and how much pleasure they're gonna see on desperate housewives

yes

[02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:17.020]
more than see this is what this is what's going on remember what i told you

[02:12:17.020 --> 02:12:19.220]
whatever your government tells you it's a lie

[02:12:19.220 --> 02:12:20.880]
that they tell you it's to date

[02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:22.220]
look at the calendar again

[02:12:22.220 --> 02:12:26.440]
just like our management whatever they tell you about a beep but a book but

[02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:29.120]
about although our management don't know enough about the business to tell you

[02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:30.060]
make up any stories

[02:12:30.460 --> 02:12:32.980]
when i'm in the middle of that conversation in our art

[02:12:32.980 --> 02:12:35.640]
uh... i just can't even describe it to you

[02:12:35.640 --> 02:12:37.140]
how frustrating it is

[02:12:37.140 --> 02:12:40.500]
in our new general man who's been there now a half a year and he says

[02:12:40.500 --> 02:12:44.120]
all we got a plan we got a plan but let me ask you this i don't you don't want

[02:12:44.120 --> 02:12:46.160]
to get involved in programming what would you do

[02:12:46.680 --> 02:12:50.300]
this is the same thing you asked me back in january her favorite when it was

[02:12:50.300 --> 02:12:51.460]
what would i do

[02:12:51.460 --> 02:12:52.720]
so what would you

[02:12:53.440 --> 02:12:54.600]
blow the place up

[02:12:54.600 --> 02:12:57.800]
let you guys get out of it you advance warning but all the people i like out

[02:12:57.800 --> 02:12:59.400]
of there and then just blow it up

[02:13:00.900 --> 02:13:01.340]
yeah

[02:13:02.520 --> 02:13:05.580]
just forget about it you know what i would do i pay everybody off

[02:13:06.340 --> 02:13:08.720]
everybody under contract i pay them off full amount

[02:13:08.720 --> 02:13:11.480]
and then extra ten percent just for aggravation sake

[02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:15.420]
just for destroying our livelihoods in our careers in our reputations in

[02:13:15.420 --> 02:13:16.020]
our credibility

[02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:20.060]
and then i would then i would like to just put on her gary and mizurka's

[02:13:20.060 --> 02:13:20.640]
right

[02:13:21.240 --> 02:13:23.380]
only a jerk i don't like a good mizurka

[02:13:24.220 --> 02:13:28.600]
more than a half century after hostilities and in korea a document from the

[02:13:28.600 --> 02:13:30.300]
worst chaotic early days is come to light

[02:13:30.300 --> 02:13:33.560]
a letter from the u.s. ambassador to the soul and for me the state department

[02:13:33.560 --> 02:13:37.020]
that american soldiers would shoot refugees approaching their lines

[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:41.480]
the letter dated the army's mass killing a south Korean refugees at no gun

[02:13:41.480 --> 02:13:45.240]
re in nineteen fifty is the strongest indication yet that such a policy

[02:13:45.240 --> 02:13:48.620]
existed for all u.s. forces in korea and the first evidence that the

[02:13:48.620 --> 02:13:50.540]
policy was known to upper ranks of the u.s. government

[02:13:50.540 --> 02:13:52.240]
you know i give them hell harry

[02:13:53.080 --> 02:13:57.080]
if refugees do appear from north of u.s. lines they'll receive warning shots

[02:13:57.080 --> 02:14:00.060]
and if they then persistent advancing they will be shot

[02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:03.680]
wrote ambassador john jay moochio and his message to assistant secretary

[02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:04.680]
state dean rusk

[02:14:04.680 --> 02:14:07.820]
letter reported on the system made a high level meeting in south korea july

[02:14:07.820 --> 02:14:11.300]
twenty-fifth nineteen fifty the night before the seven u.s. cavalry regimen

[02:14:11.300 --> 02:14:14.920]
shot the refugees at no gun re estimates very on the number of dead in

[02:14:14.920 --> 02:14:18.440]
over in american soldiers estimated they have forage from under a hundred

[02:14:18.440 --> 02:14:21.840]
to hundreds dead korea and survivors say about four hundred mostly women and

[02:14:21.840 --> 02:14:24.820]
children were killed at the village of hundred miles southeast of soul the

[02:14:24.820 --> 02:14:28.020]
south korean capital hundreds more refugees were killed in later similar

[02:14:28.020 --> 02:14:31.740]
episodes the no gun re killings were documented in a period surprised when he

[02:14:31.740 --> 02:14:34.720]
story by the ap in nineteen ninety nine which prompted a sixteen month

[02:14:34.720 --> 02:14:35.600]
pentagon inquiry

[02:14:36.160 --> 02:14:39.380]
the pentagon concluded that the no-go-round reshootings which lasted three days

[02:14:39.380 --> 02:14:43.480]
were an unfortunate tragedy not delivered killing it suggested that panicky

[02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:46.860]
soldiers acting without orders open fire because they fear that an approaching

[02:14:46.860 --> 02:14:50.560]
line of families baggage and farm animals concealed enemy troops

[02:14:51.080 --> 02:14:54.180]
but moochio's letter indicates the action of the seven cavalry were consistent

[02:14:54.180 --> 02:14:58.600]
with policy adopted because of concern that north koreans would infiltrate via

[02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:01.960]
refugee columns and it's subsequent months u.s. commanders repeatedly ordered

[02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:05.840]
refugees shot documents prove how do you like that when it out

[02:15:08.680 --> 02:15:12.260]
how's that sound probably don't look like it's like during the mario bolif

[02:15:12.260 --> 02:15:15.740]
like when all of the delas are criminals and mental patients he sent in here

[02:15:15.740 --> 02:15:17.920]
with all the other family members you know how would that have been

[02:15:18.400 --> 02:15:21.320]
Bobby Graham would have said when it out take them out how would that have gone

[02:15:21.320 --> 02:15:23.460]

[02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:01.640]
Weed.

[02:27:01.740 --> 02:27:01.920]
Hey.

[02:27:02.180 --> 02:27:02.380]
Hello.

[02:27:02.580 --> 02:27:02.940]
Hello from the Weed.

[02:27:02.960 --> 02:27:03.120]
Yes.

[02:27:03.640 --> 02:27:03.840]
Neil.

[02:27:04.380 --> 02:27:04.480]
Yeah.

[02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:06.380]
I heard you talk about Richie Habner.

[02:27:07.280 --> 02:27:07.720]
Yes.

[02:27:07.940 --> 02:27:10.340]
I was in the Marines with him for a while.

[02:27:10.900 --> 02:27:11.940]
He was really a grave digger.

[02:27:12.380 --> 02:27:12.600]
Yeah.

[02:27:12.880 --> 02:27:13.640]
He was a good dude.

[02:27:13.800 --> 02:27:15.000]
He had been Bob Moose.

[02:27:15.100 --> 02:27:15.700]
Remember Bob Moose?

[02:27:15.700 --> 02:27:16.240]
Bob Moose.

[02:27:16.240 --> 02:27:17.260]
Now Bob Moose is dead.

[02:27:17.500 --> 02:27:17.660]
Yeah.

[02:27:17.740 --> 02:27:19.580]
He got killed in the automobile accident.

[02:27:19.780 --> 02:27:19.880]
Yeah.

[02:27:19.940 --> 02:27:21.880]
The funny thing is something happened about Moose.

[02:27:21.880 --> 02:27:23.720]
He almost got killed one time.

[02:27:23.720 --> 02:27:25.280]
And then he had an accident and he won.

[02:27:25.380 --> 02:27:26.880]
I guess it was his time, man.

[02:27:26.880 --> 02:27:27.300]
Oh, man.

[02:27:27.300 --> 02:27:27.940]
He was crazy.

[02:27:27.980 --> 02:27:29.440]
I'll tell you about Richie Habner.

[02:27:29.620 --> 02:27:30.720]
He was a really good dude, man.

[02:27:30.820 --> 02:27:31.620]
He was a good ball player.

[02:27:32.200 --> 02:27:32.880]
He's saying it was.

[02:27:33.080 --> 02:27:33.640]
He's not dead.

[02:27:33.780 --> 02:27:36.560]
No, I think he was in coaching for a while.

[02:27:36.600 --> 02:27:38.320]
He was coaching in the minors and stuff.

[02:27:39.160 --> 02:27:41.240]
But he played for Pittsburgh for a long time.

[02:27:41.360 --> 02:27:41.580]
Oh, yeah.

[02:27:41.660 --> 02:27:42.500]
The third base, I know.

[02:27:42.560 --> 02:27:43.680]
It was really good pirate teams.

[02:27:43.880 --> 02:27:44.060]
Yep.

[02:27:44.360 --> 02:27:45.000]
Yep, sure was.

[02:27:45.380 --> 02:27:46.120]
Okay, thanks, Pallee.

[02:27:46.220 --> 02:27:46.440]
Alrighty.

[02:27:46.920 --> 02:27:47.460]
See how to write.

[02:27:47.780 --> 02:27:48.580]
See how to buy prints.

[02:27:48.700 --> 02:27:49.280]
He's dead too.

[02:27:49.760 --> 02:27:50.160]
What a shame.

[02:27:50.720 --> 02:27:52.080]
How come I don't have that clip in here?

[02:27:52.080 --> 02:27:52.320]
I know.

[02:27:52.420 --> 02:27:52.960]
I've played it.

[02:27:53.060 --> 02:27:54.020]
You've got it in there.

[02:27:54.140 --> 02:27:55.100]
I just don't have it here.

[02:27:55.580 --> 02:27:56.700]
And you just can't look.

[02:27:57.280 --> 02:27:58.580]
You looked and looked under what?

[02:27:58.780 --> 02:27:59.060]
I know.

[02:27:59.240 --> 02:28:00.840]
I've played it on that DCS, man.

[02:28:01.500 --> 02:28:03.340]
Or maybe I've played it off the damn room, huh?

[02:28:04.180 --> 02:28:05.760]
No, it's not under Bob and Thunder Prince.

[02:28:06.040 --> 02:28:07.500]
Maybe it's under baseball.

[02:28:07.500 --> 02:28:07.940]
It's not under baseball.

[02:28:08.080 --> 02:28:08.680]
It's under baseball.

[02:28:08.880 --> 02:28:09.720]
It's under baseball fever.

[02:28:10.240 --> 02:28:11.040]
Baseball violence.

[02:28:11.440 --> 02:28:12.280]
What the hell is that?

[02:28:12.640 --> 02:28:16.760]
We'll be drinking every hit in the air.

[02:28:17.340 --> 02:28:18.300]
We'll be drinking.

[02:28:20.360 --> 02:28:21.700]
I knock one down.

[02:28:21.880 --> 02:28:23.020]
It's a bad two again.

[02:28:23.400 --> 02:28:24.220]
We're the big ones.

[02:28:24.640 --> 02:28:26.180]
Down, I scream and shout.

[02:28:26.580 --> 02:28:27.660]
We said drink again.

[02:28:27.940 --> 02:28:29.460]
They never got a strike without.

[02:28:29.820 --> 02:28:31.000]
Now it's both counts.

[02:28:31.420 --> 02:28:32.300]
So I drink again.

[02:28:32.800 --> 02:28:34.860]
I'm better not throw them out on a dark lake.

[02:28:35.020 --> 02:28:35.500]
Throw it up.

[02:28:35.940 --> 02:28:36.960]
I think I went to hell.

[02:28:37.320 --> 02:28:38.920]
I better go and bring the shout out.

[02:28:38.980 --> 02:28:40.920]
I bet you got it on a cart down there on the floor.

[02:28:41.020 --> 02:28:41.800]
You got it on the cart.

[02:28:42.240 --> 02:28:43.480]
Bob Prince, it says on it.

[02:28:44.160 --> 02:28:46.300]
One of the interesting things is that I know he says,

[02:28:46.460 --> 02:28:48.200]
Gorkat, three, three in the bottom of the seven.

[02:28:48.280 --> 02:28:48.280]

[02:28:48.280 --> 02:28:48.280]

[02:28:48.280 --> 02:28:48.280]

[02:28:48.280 --> 02:28:48.280]

[02:28:48.900 --> 02:28:50.560]
One ball and one strike.

[02:28:51.580 --> 02:28:53.660]
Who's going to be lined up in the one one pitch?

[02:28:54.940 --> 02:28:56.780]
Come on, Jim and James are right here.

[02:28:57.320 --> 02:28:58.700]
Gorkat, kiss and goodbye.

[02:29:02.420 --> 02:29:03.080]
That's not good.

[02:29:05.100 --> 02:29:07.500]
Oh, maybe he gets that baby out of sight.

[02:29:07.880 --> 02:29:08.760]
He's cremated it.

[02:29:09.420 --> 02:29:10.920]
Are there more than one cut on this cart?

[02:29:10.920 --> 02:29:12.440]
I don't think so.

[02:29:12.720 --> 02:29:14.340]
Because this just says Bob Prince on this cart.

[02:29:14.820 --> 02:29:18.240]
When I was it, I was like,

[02:29:18.240 --> 02:29:18.900]
Are you important?

[02:29:19.400 --> 02:29:21.180]
When the cart recues, let's see what comes out.

[02:29:21.640 --> 02:29:23.020]
I mean, he was no Dave Ann Boring.

[02:29:23.520 --> 02:29:25.240]
See, this is what I'm trying to tell you, Josh.

[02:29:25.240 --> 02:29:26.180]
You all listen to me.

[02:29:27.400 --> 02:29:29.220]
Gorkat, three, three in the bottom of the seven.

[02:29:29.460 --> 02:29:30.260]
The same thing with you.

[02:29:31.140 --> 02:29:33.560]
But I mean, just about every team had like

[02:29:33.560 --> 02:29:34.900]
legendary broadcasters.

[02:29:35.460 --> 02:29:37.780]
There was Jack Quinlan and Harry Carey with the Cubs

[02:29:37.780 --> 02:29:40.580]
and all these great, fantastic and Mel Allen,

[02:29:40.820 --> 02:29:44.340]
Red Barber and Jim Woods with the Yankees.

[02:29:44.720 --> 02:29:47.040]
And Jim was worked with Kurt Gaudy and Boston.

[02:29:47.440 --> 02:29:48.720]
And then Harry and St. Louis.

[02:29:49.380 --> 02:29:51.920]
Great, great sports casters and the Bob Prince

[02:29:51.920 --> 02:29:52.780]
and all these other people.

[02:29:52.860 --> 02:29:53.960]
And now, well, what do we got now?

[02:29:54.400 --> 02:29:55.620]
I don't even know who these people are.

[02:29:55.760 --> 02:29:57.700]
And then you tell me about Joe Buck being a great baseball

[02:29:57.700 --> 02:29:58.080]
announcer.

[02:29:58.920 --> 02:29:59.420]
He's good.

[02:29:59.580 --> 02:29:59.860]
What did you say?

[02:30:00.020 --> 02:30:00.520]
Yeah, he's good.

[02:30:01.260 --> 02:30:02.940]
Great. He's very good.

[02:30:04.220 --> 02:30:05.920]
I wouldn't put him in the great category.

[02:30:06.480 --> 02:30:07.800]
Now, he's no Harry Carey.

[02:30:08.240 --> 02:30:09.460]
No. Who is, though?

[02:30:09.820 --> 02:30:10.620]
He's no Bob Prince.

[02:30:11.220 --> 02:30:13.100]
He's no Mel Allen, right?

[02:30:13.820 --> 02:30:14.080]
Okay.

[02:30:14.640 --> 02:30:15.640]
He's no Ish Kavibble.

[02:30:15.640 --> 02:30:16.840]
He's no Dave Van Boring.

[02:30:17.340 --> 02:30:19.640]
Now, you've got to admit that Joe Buck's better than Dave Van Boring.

[02:30:20.960 --> 02:30:22.020]
Well, it's different.

[02:30:22.260 --> 02:30:23.300]
You know, it's radio and TV.

[02:30:23.500 --> 02:30:23.960]
Totally different.

[02:30:25.840 --> 02:30:27.740]
Oh, well, actually, we spotted that time.

[02:30:27.740 --> 02:30:28.940]
I'm pretty proud of you.

[02:30:29.180 --> 02:30:30.060]
You actually made a response.

[02:30:30.380 --> 02:30:30.860]
People attend.

[02:30:31.740 --> 02:30:32.100]
But...

[02:30:32.100 --> 02:30:32.800]
2001 Vogue.

[02:30:33.280 --> 02:30:34.460]
What do I tell you, man?

[02:30:34.620 --> 02:30:36.020]
Just like driving over the edge of a cliff.

[02:30:36.380 --> 02:30:38.060]
Just like Kathy Bates in Missouri.

[02:30:38.940 --> 02:30:40.340]
I forget the beginning of the movie.

[02:30:40.440 --> 02:30:41.120]
He did drive all.

[02:30:41.200 --> 02:30:42.500]
He ran off the road or something.

[02:30:42.720 --> 02:30:42.860]
Right.

[02:30:43.440 --> 02:30:44.320]
And she went and found him.

[02:30:44.400 --> 02:30:45.140]
She rescued him right.

[02:30:45.140 --> 02:30:47.040]
And realized there was him and he was...

[02:30:47.040 --> 02:30:48.100]
She was his biggest fan.

[02:30:48.280 --> 02:30:48.580]
That's right.

[02:30:48.740 --> 02:30:49.080]
The biggest.

[02:30:49.780 --> 02:30:50.440]
And Radist.

[02:30:51.680 --> 02:30:53.280]
He had a little bit of a kneecap problem.

[02:30:53.380 --> 02:30:54.320]
And I'm going to be James Conn.

[02:30:54.420 --> 02:30:55.580]
Well, this wasn't a kneecap.

[02:30:55.780 --> 02:30:57.000]
It was his ankles.

[02:30:57.480 --> 02:30:57.900]
And in the book.

[02:30:58.360 --> 02:30:58.680]
No, no.

[02:30:58.800 --> 02:30:59.600]
It was not his ankles.

[02:30:59.760 --> 02:31:00.740]
Didn't she like to do his knees?

[02:31:01.200 --> 02:31:02.480]
It was the...

[02:31:02.480 --> 02:31:05.180]
She tied a board between his feet.

[02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:09.040]
And knocked his feet sideways and inward towards each other.

[02:31:09.060 --> 02:31:09.240]
Ooh.

[02:31:09.380 --> 02:31:10.340]
That was a broken ankle.

[02:31:10.480 --> 02:31:13.180]
But in the book, I understand she cut his feet off.

[02:31:13.740 --> 02:31:13.960]
Oh!

[02:31:14.360 --> 02:31:14.680]
Yeah.

[02:31:15.120 --> 02:31:18.380]
Well, if that's the case, then how do you do all the other things that we some do in the movie?

[02:31:18.540 --> 02:31:19.800]
I guess he doesn't crawl around.

[02:31:20.120 --> 02:31:20.720]
Did he really?

[02:31:21.140 --> 02:31:22.240]
In a lot of pain, I would think.

[02:31:22.440 --> 02:31:22.820]
See now that.

[02:31:23.020 --> 02:31:23.600]
That's just ridiculous.

[02:31:24.640 --> 02:31:27.120]
How would he survive if he tapped his feet off?

[02:31:27.380 --> 02:31:30.220]
Well, you know, he'd tie them off so that you don't bleed.

[02:31:30.900 --> 02:31:31.980]
And then he'd chop them off.

[02:31:32.680 --> 02:31:33.540]
Sounds like a book.

[02:31:34.140 --> 02:31:35.620]
Sounds to me like a voice of experience.

[02:31:35.760 --> 02:31:37.740]
Either that or somebody who's been studying up on this stuff.

[02:31:38.120 --> 02:31:39.540]
I'd be very careful, Crystal.

[02:31:40.260 --> 02:31:40.880]
I got plans.

[02:31:44.580 --> 02:31:45.980]
So I think I can cut her feet off.

[02:31:46.240 --> 02:31:49.480]
So I think what you're trying to say is when she cuts you off this when you're cutting her off.

[02:31:49.620 --> 02:31:50.500]
Well, I'm not going to cut her feet off.

[02:31:50.580 --> 02:31:51.280]
How's she going to...

[02:31:51.280 --> 02:31:52.480]
Just walk away.

[02:31:52.800 --> 02:31:53.300]
Nice to meet you.

[02:31:53.760 --> 02:31:58.680]
Hey, if you think you have termites in your home, call our friends at Riddett Pest Control today for a free termite inspection.

[02:31:59.100 --> 02:32:01.240]
Tell them that Todd Dreck is just an absolute idiot.

[02:32:01.740 --> 02:32:05.720]
Riddett Pest Control uses an amazing orange or a treatment that kills termites and termites.

[02:32:06.180 --> 02:32:07.280]
100% on contact.

[02:32:07.280 --> 02:32:08.800]
They are gone faster than you can say.

[02:32:09.160 --> 02:32:10.340]
Todd Dreck get lost.

[02:32:10.940 --> 02:32:13.180]
If you have termites, it's the best possible way to get rid of them.

[02:32:13.260 --> 02:32:15.000]
And you don't have to tempt your house either.

[02:32:15.320 --> 02:32:18.180]
Most of the companies may not want to come and put that big circus stand on your home.

[02:32:18.500 --> 02:32:19.840]
That's only good in Joe Bell's neighborhood.

[02:32:20.280 --> 02:32:23.700]
You don't have to worry about poisonous gas, no moving out or staying in hotels or motels.

[02:32:24.120 --> 02:32:28.360]
No worry about food or pets in your health because at Riddett Pest Control, they come to your house

[02:32:28.360 --> 02:32:30.060]
and they treat it with this amazing orange oil.

[02:32:30.360 --> 02:32:31.200]
You don't have to leave it all.

[02:32:31.520 --> 02:32:36.220]
In fact, when they're done treating your property, they're only going to have to leave it behind as a clean set of oranges for just a few days.

[02:32:36.220 --> 02:32:39.460]
It's true if you have a termite problem called Riddett Pest Control right now

[02:32:39.460 --> 02:32:43.140]
and ask about their amazing orange oil treatment that kills termites and their eggs.

[02:32:43.500 --> 02:32:44.580]
100% on contact.

[02:32:44.920 --> 02:32:47.220]
No tending, no BS, no ripoffs, no kidding.

[02:32:47.660 --> 02:32:48.900]
Call right now for free inspection.

[02:32:49.040 --> 02:32:51.380]
There is absolutely no obligation to keep in mind again.

[02:32:51.620 --> 02:32:55.420]
It's the beginning of hurricane season and termite season that go hand in gland.

[02:32:55.880 --> 02:33:00.380]
For a free no obligation inspection, call Riddett at 1-800-447-4348.

[02:33:00.680 --> 02:33:03.180]
That's 1-800-447-4348.

[02:33:03.480 --> 02:33:04.800]
Be sure and mention Todd Dreck's name.

[02:33:04.800 --> 02:33:05.740]
And give him a good chuckle.

[02:33:06.020 --> 02:33:06.700]
And they'll say who?

[02:33:07.220 --> 02:33:10.460]
1-800-447-4348.

[02:33:10.740 --> 02:33:13.000]
This is Neil Rogers.

[02:33:14.020 --> 02:33:17.620]
This is 5.16QA Waxop.

[02:33:18.880 --> 02:33:21.580]
Joseph Dew to preach this Mr. Bill.

[02:33:21.880 --> 02:33:22.400]
Why me?

[02:33:22.760 --> 02:33:24.560]
Because you're on television dummy.

[02:33:25.780 --> 02:33:32.580]
In theaters now, from the director of the Da Vinci Code, it's the Bush Code.

[02:33:32.580 --> 02:33:35.140]
He sent messages to him.

[02:33:35.560 --> 02:33:40.540]
There's an ingenious code blocked into President Bush's rambling speeches.

[02:33:40.600 --> 02:33:42.260]
Our children are in.

[02:33:43.240 --> 02:33:47.380]
When this I've heard, who will we once shame on you?

[02:33:48.020 --> 02:33:49.240]
We can't get through it again.

[02:33:49.480 --> 02:33:52.460]
Reveals a message that actually makes sense.

[02:33:52.740 --> 02:33:53.860]
I have to listen to mustard drink.

[02:33:55.020 --> 02:33:56.200]
Fear of jagged angl.

[02:33:56.280 --> 02:33:57.940]
And absolute nonsense.

[02:33:58.980 --> 02:34:00.260]
That is a problem.

[02:34:00.260 --> 02:34:01.540]
The Bush Code.

[02:34:01.620 --> 02:34:04.080]
It was the biggest coveroff in human history.

[02:34:04.380 --> 02:34:05.900]
I'm here to discuss our strategy.

[02:34:06.440 --> 02:34:09.420]
Without knowing the facts, then again, I don't have a lot of intelligence.

[02:34:10.620 --> 02:34:15.980]
Speaking of illuminating angel and demons, how do you like to think about Pope Pius XI and the Concordant in Italy?

[02:34:15.980 --> 02:34:16.500]
Oh, yeah.

[02:34:17.260 --> 02:34:21.900]
Hitler and Muslim and then when he changed his mind and said, hey, this isn't such a good idea.

[02:34:21.900 --> 02:34:23.200]
All these innocent people are dying.

[02:34:23.580 --> 02:34:24.240]
He died.

[02:34:24.700 --> 02:34:25.020]
Or, huh?

[02:34:25.240 --> 02:34:27.200]
Another one of them, Dr. Cups of T.

[02:34:27.620 --> 02:34:28.720]
That's so popular today.

[02:34:28.720 --> 02:34:29.920]
And there are those coincidental deaths.

[02:34:30.360 --> 02:34:33.480]
How's it like that history of the, uh, the Pops?

[02:34:33.940 --> 02:34:34.280]
Oh, yeah.

[02:34:34.500 --> 02:34:36.280]
Well, we knew there were much scoundrels anyway.

[02:34:37.480 --> 02:34:43.040]
And they're wealth and, uh, and the archives and how you can't go in there without, you know, the armed guards watching you.

[02:34:43.280 --> 02:34:44.760]
You know, 50 miles of books and I was really interested.

[02:34:44.900 --> 02:34:50.680]
And you can only, uh, get the one piece of material that you asked for and you can only take a pencil in with you and all that crap.

[02:34:51.240 --> 02:34:54.540]
You know, there will be a day we won't live long enough to see it when all that's going to come down.

[02:34:54.800 --> 02:34:55.020]
Right.

[02:34:55.500 --> 02:34:57.820]
How about all the porn on the hand there is a bad idea to do that?

[02:34:57.820 --> 02:34:58.740]
Yeah, you know it.

[02:34:58.760 --> 02:35:00.820]
Maybe they let the Swiss guard watch it to get them around.

[02:35:01.060 --> 02:35:01.600]
You know, they do.

[02:35:02.120 --> 02:35:06.780]
Here's the facts from, uh, Amy, a white female listener under 35 from New York.

[02:35:06.900 --> 02:35:07.160]
Oh!

[02:35:07.460 --> 02:35:10.320]
Who can't wait for 230 months to Friday to download and show under iPod.

[02:35:10.580 --> 02:35:11.000]
Thanks, Amy.

[02:35:11.880 --> 02:35:12.720]
She says, you are the greatest.

[02:35:12.840 --> 02:35:13.340]
Yes, I am.

[02:35:13.440 --> 02:35:14.740]
I get all my news from your show and website.

[02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:18.020]
And she says, uh, P.S. Vons blows.

[02:35:18.200 --> 02:35:18.760]
That's correct.

[02:35:18.900 --> 02:35:19.860]
And say how to Josh and George.

[02:35:20.080 --> 02:35:20.760]
Hi, Josh and George.

[02:35:21.080 --> 02:35:21.560]
Thurs and Josh.

[02:35:21.700 --> 02:35:22.720]
I'll tell Josh when he gets back.

[02:35:23.020 --> 02:35:23.720]
Oh, where do you go?

[02:35:23.960 --> 02:35:24.520]
I'm out of juice.

[02:35:24.740 --> 02:35:25.320]
I think so.

[02:35:25.320 --> 02:35:26.200]
Oh, no.

[02:35:26.420 --> 02:35:28.920]
From that lunch again, man, you guys keep eating while the show is on.

[02:35:29.020 --> 02:35:30.040]
It's AC Ducey Trace.

[02:35:30.120 --> 02:35:30.440]
Hi, Keith.

[02:35:30.500 --> 02:35:32.200]
Welcome to Swipe Off his brow and his lip.

[02:35:32.300 --> 02:35:33.320]
I'm glad that's all he's wiping.

[02:35:33.620 --> 02:35:33.720]
Woo.

[02:35:34.800 --> 02:35:35.920]
I think you were right.

[02:35:36.120 --> 02:35:36.500]
You guessed right.

[02:35:37.180 --> 02:35:37.900]
A douce.

[02:35:38.220 --> 02:35:39.260]
I heard, man, you know.

[02:35:39.660 --> 02:35:40.080]
I know.

[02:35:40.260 --> 02:35:40.660]
I know.

[02:35:40.660 --> 02:35:40.700]
Yeah.

[02:35:40.960 --> 02:35:41.740]
You don't want to rush that paper.

[02:35:41.740 --> 02:35:42.980]
Oh, I'm comfortable right now.

[02:35:43.080 --> 02:35:43.980]
No, never catch up to me.

[02:35:44.140 --> 02:35:45.680]
Well, you go back and finish the job.

[02:35:45.860 --> 02:35:49.320]
You know, there's nothing worse than like, uh, cutting off in mid-

[02:35:49.320 --> 02:35:50.460]
Well, too late now, you know.

[02:35:50.580 --> 02:35:51.780]
I have a moist heartlet for you.

[02:35:51.900 --> 02:35:52.340]
You can take that paper.

[02:35:52.440 --> 02:35:53.120]
Too late now.

[02:35:53.120 --> 02:35:54.280]
You know, he's probably got a load in his pants.

[02:35:54.460 --> 02:35:54.820]
That's right.

[02:35:56.460 --> 02:35:58.000]
Just don't get downwind.

[02:35:58.960 --> 02:36:00.120]
Like some of the people are woodbite.

[02:36:00.220 --> 02:36:00.840]
I guarantee you that.

[02:36:00.940 --> 02:36:04.480]
In fact, there was one of the lady regulars there yesterday.

[02:36:04.720 --> 02:36:07.200]
She said to me, I think that one guy's got a load in his pants.

[02:36:07.400 --> 02:36:08.980]
I mean, oh, she was like swooning.

[02:36:09.320 --> 02:36:12.800]
And all of a sudden, just as she said it, I got to just, it just reached my nasal

[02:36:12.800 --> 02:36:13.120]
pass.

[02:36:13.220 --> 02:36:14.580]
Oh, my God.

[02:36:15.080 --> 02:36:15.300]
Woo.

[02:36:16.400 --> 02:36:17.040]
Holy moly.

[02:36:17.180 --> 02:36:18.100]
How do you smell like that?

[02:36:18.920 --> 02:36:19.740]
Thousand nine votes.

[02:36:19.860 --> 02:36:21.200]
Now, here's a little more on that thing.

[02:36:21.200 --> 02:36:22.360]
It's from our website.

[02:36:23.240 --> 02:36:26.160]
Bush's candor was scripted response to a planted question.

[02:36:26.540 --> 02:36:29.280]
Not that they tried to, like, pull the wool over your eyes, the woolly bully.

[02:36:29.760 --> 02:36:33.560]
Not that they tried to put on this dog and pony show and brainwash the public and lie.

[02:36:33.900 --> 02:36:34.680]
That's their specialty.

[02:36:34.880 --> 02:36:36.660]
Maybe we ought to put Greg Reed in the cabinet, man.

[02:36:36.980 --> 02:36:37.880]
He was pretty good at lying.

[02:36:40.140 --> 02:36:40.540]
Yeah.

[02:36:41.460 --> 02:36:45.240]
President Bush is highly publicized that mission of regrets and moment of candor during

[02:36:45.240 --> 02:36:46.340]
that joint press conference.

[02:36:46.720 --> 02:36:47.760]
They were smoking it all, right?

[02:36:47.840 --> 02:36:50.700]
That's why it's a joint press conference with British Prime Minister Tony Blair this

[02:36:50.700 --> 02:36:55.420]
past week was actually a scripted response to a planted question with a British journalist.

[02:36:56.240 --> 02:36:59.860]
Capital Hill blew his learn that the question was among a list of proposed questions given

[02:36:59.860 --> 02:37:01.180]
a British report is by Blair.

[02:37:01.920 --> 02:37:05.400]
And at both the British Prime Minister and President Bush knew the question was coming and had

[02:37:05.400 --> 02:37:06.460]
prepared responses.

[02:37:07.460 --> 02:37:10.940]
Newsweek correspondent Richard Wolf says it was obvious to the press to assemble for the

[02:37:10.940 --> 02:37:14.120]
press conference that Bush knew the question was coming and had a response ready.

[02:37:14.560 --> 02:37:15.900]
Of course, it was very rehearsed.

[02:37:15.920 --> 02:37:19.880]
Everything from the mannerisms you saw, the upwards glance up at the ceiling for inspiration

[02:37:19.880 --> 02:37:23.920]
Wolf says and for me, the big giveaway was that at the end of the answer, I don't know

[02:37:23.920 --> 02:37:27.460]
if you could see it on camera, but the president flashed a big grin to those of us sitting

[02:37:27.460 --> 02:37:28.160]
in the front rows.

[02:37:28.700 --> 02:37:31.280]
It didn't seem that it was quite as contrite as his performance.

[02:37:32.760 --> 02:37:36.480]
According to multiple sources, Blair planted the question with the British report as leaving

[02:37:36.480 --> 02:37:38.260]
England and informed the White House.

[02:37:38.660 --> 02:37:42.560]
Both Blair and Bush had scripted responses to the question and it was predetermined that

[02:37:42.560 --> 02:37:44.760]
the question would be recognized so we could ask the question.

[02:37:45.040 --> 02:37:48.400]
It was a set up from start to finish as a member of the press crew that covers Blair

[02:37:48.400 --> 02:37:49.220]
on a regular basis.

[02:37:49.740 --> 02:37:52.640]
We knew the question was coming and we knew Blair had a response ready.

[02:37:52.940 --> 02:37:55.800]
As for Bush, we didn't know if he had been brief or we suspected he had.

[02:37:56.160 --> 02:37:59.660]
Two sources within the White House confirmed Bush knew the question was coming and was

[02:37:59.660 --> 02:38:01.060]
ready with this scripted response.

[02:38:01.720 --> 02:38:05.280]
Blair said to tell with his comment in the closing moments, you guys come on.

[02:38:05.380 --> 02:38:08.280]
I want you to, the British delegation, ask a few serious questions.

[02:38:08.720 --> 02:38:10.280]
The set up came in the second question.

[02:38:10.640 --> 02:38:13.280]
Mr. President, you spoke about missteps and mistakes in Iraq.

[02:38:13.640 --> 02:38:16.500]
Could I ask both of you which missteps and mistakes of your own, you must regret?

[02:38:16.940 --> 02:38:17.620]
Regret, regret.

[02:38:17.920 --> 02:38:18.680]
Bush was ready.

[02:38:19.120 --> 02:38:22.720]
Sounds like kind of familiar refrain here saying bring it on kind of tough talk, you know,

[02:38:22.800 --> 02:38:24.060]
that he sent the wrong signal to people.

[02:38:24.540 --> 02:38:27.820]
I learned some lessons about expressing myself maybe a little more sophisticated manner.

[02:38:28.020 --> 02:38:29.820]
You know, wanted to do to rely that kind of talk.

[02:38:30.260 --> 02:38:33.320]
I think in certain parts of the world, I was misinterpreted and so I learned from that.

[02:38:33.660 --> 02:38:36.800]
And I think the biggest mistake that's happened so far, at least in our country's involvement

[02:38:36.800 --> 02:38:40.760]
in Iraq is Abu Gharr, we've been paying for that for a long period of time.

[02:38:41.060 --> 02:38:44.680]
And it's unlike Iraq, however, under Sodom, the people who committed those acts were brought

[02:38:44.680 --> 02:38:47.440]
up to justice, they've been given a fair trial and tried and convicted.

[02:38:47.940 --> 02:38:52.160]
Wolf said Bush has to go the regret route because his other tried phrases just don't work

[02:38:52.160 --> 02:38:52.600]
anymore.

[02:38:53.120 --> 02:38:56.940]
I don't think those cliches actually work so much anymore, he says.

[02:38:58.440 --> 02:39:03.300]
All the cliches, all the tried bull crap all the time, kind of like talking to our management.

[02:39:03.980 --> 02:39:05.440]
Tried cliches, tried bull crap.

[02:39:06.280 --> 02:39:08.220]
But today's the water, not his last day.

[02:39:08.980 --> 02:39:12.180]
Let's see if I get a response to any of my outbursts this morning, huh?

[02:39:12.740 --> 02:39:15.260]
I'm not, you know something I'm all done talking to those people.

[02:39:15.500 --> 02:39:16.360]
Let them talk to Norma.

[02:39:16.560 --> 02:39:17.220]
Let them talk to you.

[02:39:17.540 --> 02:39:20.640]
Oh, here's two massages, neither one of them from anybody there.

[02:39:21.100 --> 02:39:21.340]
Spain.

[02:39:21.860 --> 02:39:27.640]
No, it's just a new stuff, you know, move on.org and some other thing, Tom Payne.

[02:39:28.080 --> 02:39:28.780]
Stuff like that.

[02:39:29.040 --> 02:39:32.120]
Stuff that's going on in the world as opposed to the nothingness that's going on there,

[02:39:32.120 --> 02:39:33.400]
but they got some plans, baby.

[02:39:33.600 --> 02:39:37.000]
We got some plans, like we never used to say, we got package plans.

[02:39:37.220 --> 02:39:37.700]
Evil plans?

[02:39:38.200 --> 02:39:38.980]
Well, I sure miss him.

[02:39:39.080 --> 02:39:40.760]
I sure miss all the good radio people, man.

[02:39:41.040 --> 02:39:41.440]
They're all dead.

[02:39:41.440 --> 02:39:42.960]
At least most of them.

[02:39:43.040 --> 02:39:43.200]
Yeah.

[02:39:43.480 --> 02:39:44.040]
Squirt word.

[02:39:44.280 --> 02:39:46.460]
I'm just telling you right now, most of the real radio people.

[02:39:46.620 --> 02:39:49.520]
Of course, we miss suds too, but you'll, you know, let's see, when are you going to have

[02:39:49.520 --> 02:39:50.920]
mine this summer all the time on Fridays?

[02:39:51.340 --> 02:39:52.580]
As much as possible.

[02:39:52.900 --> 02:39:56.020]
He needs a busy man, you know, as much as Rams and Crutch.

[02:39:56.200 --> 02:39:57.080]
Busy doing what?

[02:39:57.560 --> 02:39:58.480]
Oh, who knows?

[02:39:58.900 --> 02:39:59.660]
Get out of here.

[02:39:59.680 --> 02:40:02.000]
What if my wife worked and I had my days free?

[02:40:02.240 --> 02:40:02.980]
I'd be busy too.

[02:40:03.220 --> 02:40:04.760]
Yeah, well, I don't think he's busy doing that.

[02:40:05.080 --> 02:40:05.440]
How do you know?

[02:40:05.900 --> 02:40:06.720]
Well, I don't.

[02:40:06.740 --> 02:40:07.600]
Stay's young somehow.

[02:40:08.040 --> 02:40:08.220]
Yeah.

[02:40:08.660 --> 02:40:10.540]
He was hanging out with Rick's cheerleading wife.

[02:40:10.540 --> 02:40:10.980]
I don't know.

[02:40:11.120 --> 02:40:12.280]
You know, he's only two years younger than you.

[02:40:13.060 --> 02:40:16.560]
And when your pride is, he sure looks like 15 years younger than me.

[02:40:16.740 --> 02:40:18.860]
It's a work for the gray hair, which isn't that what you're trying to say?

[02:40:19.220 --> 02:40:20.680]
Yeah, he looks like he does.

[02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:21.260]
He does.

[02:40:21.260 --> 02:40:21.340]
He does.

[02:40:21.540 --> 02:40:24.220]
I look like an old toad, but I'd say he'll want to get old with no 63.

[02:40:24.620 --> 02:40:25.640]
No, he'll be there over 62.

[02:40:26.260 --> 02:40:27.380]
You look, you look normal.

[02:40:27.740 --> 02:40:28.680]
50-ish, right?

[02:40:29.140 --> 02:40:30.160]
I could pass for like 56.

[02:40:30.540 --> 02:40:30.940]
Yes, you could.

[02:40:31.500 --> 02:40:31.640]
Yeah.

[02:40:32.140 --> 02:40:32.900]
Well, how do you know?

[02:40:33.020 --> 02:40:34.440]
You haven't seen me in a long time.

[02:40:34.780 --> 02:40:35.680]
I guess five.

[02:40:36.080 --> 02:40:36.560]
I guess five.

[02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:37.400]
I like my skin.

[02:40:37.660 --> 02:40:40.160]
And now I like redo it every, every second day.

[02:40:40.160 --> 02:40:42.420]
I don't let it even grow like a little bit every two days.

[02:40:42.740 --> 02:40:44.540]
I like to skin him few, right?

[02:40:45.040 --> 02:40:45.460]
Do you like to do?

[02:40:45.640 --> 02:40:46.280]
Do you like to rub it?

[02:40:46.400 --> 02:40:47.300]
And you go like my own hair.

[02:40:47.380 --> 02:40:47.780]
I don't hate to rub it.

[02:40:50.280 --> 02:40:52.000]
I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to record.

[02:40:52.160 --> 02:40:55.880]
I'm going to PVR that, you know, you know that Josh Cortis don't have PVR?

[02:40:56.260 --> 02:40:56.780]
I don't either.

[02:40:56.940 --> 02:40:58.440]
You write PVR.

[02:40:58.760 --> 02:41:00.160]
Well, on your thing, it's DVR.

[02:41:00.220 --> 02:41:01.120]
My, what the hell is this?

[02:41:01.320 --> 02:41:02.260]
I don't know what DVR is.

[02:41:02.700 --> 02:41:02.700]

[02:41:02.840 --> 02:41:02.960]
What?

[02:41:03.220 --> 02:41:03.920]
We're not Canadians.

[02:41:04.200 --> 02:41:06.580]
I have a DVD that can recordable DVD player.

[02:41:06.700 --> 02:41:07.460]
Well, there you go.

[02:41:07.760 --> 02:41:09.040]
But Josh doesn't have that.

[02:41:09.120 --> 02:41:09.520]
You don't have it.

[02:41:09.520 --> 02:41:12.600]
He doesn't even have a VCR anymore because they went out with Nicaris.

[02:41:12.760 --> 02:41:13.580]
So I have a VCR.

[02:41:13.580 --> 02:41:14.820]
I've got to give him a VCR for anything.

[02:41:15.040 --> 02:41:15.940]
So you can watch Gone With The Wind.

[02:41:16.020 --> 02:41:17.920]
Buy him a VCR for Christ's sake.

[02:41:18.140 --> 02:41:19.140]
See, I got a hand me down.

[02:41:19.200 --> 02:41:19.460]
He can have.

[02:41:19.800 --> 02:41:20.500]
Well, good, good.

[02:41:20.940 --> 02:41:22.560]
Did they make cleaning tapes for those things anymore?

[02:41:23.400 --> 02:41:24.360]
Why, you got dirty heads?

[02:41:24.720 --> 02:41:25.560]
That's got to be it's old.

[02:41:26.060 --> 02:41:28.880]
Just like QA and Man, you ever go in there and take a look talk about dirty heads?

[02:41:28.880 --> 02:41:30.660]
You should have seen the bathroom on Memorial Day, man.

[02:41:30.740 --> 02:41:31.540]
It was memorialable.

[02:41:32.020 --> 02:41:34.700]
There must have been a party over here this weekend that we weren't invited to.

[02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.720]
Or maybe a fat boy had a little problem.

[02:41:37.720 --> 02:41:41.740]
When we the first time, 28 past 1, a QA of here, cigar smoke, we're allowed to kick back

[02:41:41.740 --> 02:41:43.100]
with a good premium Stogi.

[02:41:43.640 --> 02:41:46.080]
Then Behia cigars, Vitone, where Hania is for you.

[02:41:46.480 --> 02:41:47.420]
He's hard to find cigars.

[02:41:47.440 --> 02:41:50.240]
I made with first grade tobacco process, aged up to 10 years.

[02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:55.100]
Behia is a real boutique cigar maker, specializing in small bites, hard to find tobacco.

[02:41:55.560 --> 02:42:00.100]
Behia gold, a flagship line gets a 91 rating by cigar, 15 out of cigar and cider, and

[02:42:00.100 --> 02:42:01.740]
9.1 by Schmok Magazine.

[02:42:02.340 --> 02:42:06.560]
This rich flavored well-balanced, full-bodied Nicaraguan cigars, got earthy hints of dark

[02:42:06.560 --> 02:42:09.300]
roast coffee, chocolate, spicy pepper flavors.

[02:42:09.640 --> 02:42:11.520]
Let's stand on a rain-naked until him were the cigars.

[02:42:11.680 --> 02:42:14.600]
Also tried to be here to say of the hottest release of cigar in the last 10 months.

[02:42:14.880 --> 02:42:18.980]
The decai gets a high rating of 91 by cigar, fishing out of cigar and cider.

[02:42:19.340 --> 02:42:23.260]
It's a big, powerful cigar, even fidelwood like this, with complex notes of leather, earth,

[02:42:23.280 --> 02:42:23.620]
and pepper.

[02:42:23.980 --> 02:42:26.800]
The finish is long and full-bodied with additional spicy note of charred wood.

[02:42:27.120 --> 02:42:31.200]
And if you want to save 40% off on all your Behia cigars, when you call us toll free number,

[02:42:31.340 --> 02:42:33.820]
tell them that old Neil Rogers, don't be ashamed.

[02:42:34.160 --> 02:42:34.840]
Don't be too embarrassed.

[02:42:34.840 --> 02:42:37.140]
Tell Neil for the decai will save 40%.

[02:42:37.140 --> 02:42:39.000]
1 835 a year.

[02:42:39.260 --> 02:42:41.840]
That's 1 800-35 BAHIA.

[02:42:43.380 --> 02:42:45.440]
This is Neil Rogers.

[02:42:46.360 --> 02:42:49.000]
This is 516-QAZ.

[02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:52.520]
Neil.

[02:42:54.960 --> 02:42:58.080]
I've been to Iraq nine times in the last three years.

[02:42:58.320 --> 02:42:59.420]
I've seen bombs and blood.

[02:42:59.420 --> 02:43:01.020]
I've seen death and democracy.

[02:43:01.520 --> 02:43:02.160]
I've seen a lot.

[02:43:02.520 --> 02:43:03.560]
But what have I heard?

[02:43:03.560 --> 02:43:04.540]
That's easy.

[02:43:04.820 --> 02:43:05.720]
Lionel Ritchie.

[02:43:05.940 --> 02:43:08.340]
Well, my friends, the time has come.

[02:43:09.840 --> 02:43:12.380]
There is a root blow up someone.

[02:43:14.320 --> 02:43:17.080]
You don't need to shoot any gun.

[02:43:18.760 --> 02:43:20.740]
Get up there and plant bombs.

[02:43:21.040 --> 02:43:22.180]
I've got plant bombs, plant bombs.

[02:43:23.140 --> 02:43:25.960]
I have the mind that they're in the street.

[02:43:27.460 --> 02:43:30.200]
If they do watch it, they put their feet.

[02:43:30.200 --> 02:43:35.620]
We're going to party while we dig and have those experiences.

[02:43:36.340 --> 02:43:39.320]
And listen to those lion nails too.

[02:43:40.220 --> 02:43:43.860]
All night, all night, all night.

[02:43:44.200 --> 02:43:48.220]
All night, all night, all night.

[02:43:48.220 --> 02:43:52.520]
All night, all night, all night.

[02:43:52.920 --> 02:43:58.060]
We're all night, all night, all night.

[02:43:58.060 --> 02:43:59.860]
We'll get the enemy.

[02:44:00.680 --> 02:44:03.660]
I can't do that, I don't mention all my bombs.

[02:44:03.920 --> 02:44:06.940]
All night, all night, all night.

[02:44:07.280 --> 02:44:08.960]
We'll do it, sleep with me.

[02:44:09.660 --> 02:44:11.140]
I'd bomb them if they'd stand.

[02:44:11.480 --> 02:44:13.380]
We'll stop all night.

[02:44:14.820 --> 02:44:15.840]
All night, all night.

[02:44:15.900 --> 02:44:22.040]
In a country torn apart by sectarian divisions, the one thing soon is that should I share

[02:44:22.040 --> 02:44:25.720]
is a complete and utter devotion to Lionel Ritchie.

[02:44:25.720 --> 02:44:29.000]
They are a united Legion for Lionel.

[02:44:29.100 --> 02:44:30.340]
What are you going to do about it?

[02:44:30.500 --> 02:44:31.020]
You fairy.

[02:44:31.260 --> 02:44:34.720]
135, 25, go to, we got a 133 votes on a pool man.

[02:44:34.720 --> 02:44:40.040]
Everything is just going swimmingly well until two and when that comes along, all week long.

[02:44:40.280 --> 02:44:40.880]
Oh God.

[02:44:41.620 --> 02:44:45.060]
Thank God for that big Orlando rumor yesterday, a candle Toyota, you know what?

[02:44:45.380 --> 02:44:46.420]
Yeah, that's what I said.

[02:44:46.760 --> 02:44:47.620]
Thank the Lord for that.

[02:44:48.140 --> 02:44:49.100]
In fact, you know who you can thank?

[02:44:49.300 --> 02:44:50.620]
Damn, yeah, that one.

[02:44:51.200 --> 02:44:52.340]
I think I made the right choice.

[02:44:52.340 --> 02:44:53.700]
We both agree.

[02:44:54.140 --> 02:44:54.420]
Over here.

[02:44:54.540 --> 02:44:57.840]
Both of you had a productive two hours, at least more productive than sitting there on Memorial Day,

[02:44:58.260 --> 02:45:00.260]
trying to do a show on a holiday when there ain't nobody.

[02:45:00.700 --> 02:45:04.880]
I mean, only the most lifeless of the Desperadois would be around on Memorial Day.

[02:45:05.160 --> 02:45:07.360]
When you agree, everybody was out at the beach.

[02:45:07.880 --> 02:45:12.720]
Tobacco, deadly in any form or disguise, is the slogan of the World Health Organization's number one to,

[02:45:13.700 --> 02:45:16.040]
let me try it again, World No Tobacco Day tomorrow.

[02:45:16.540 --> 02:45:16.720]
Tomorrow.

[02:45:17.160 --> 02:45:17.800]
The claim is false.

[02:45:18.080 --> 02:45:19.040]
Tobacco is not deadly.

[02:45:19.380 --> 02:45:20.360]
The harm is in the smoke.

[02:45:20.360 --> 02:45:26.960]
A policy that confuses innocuous tobacco with harmful smoke is responsible for millions of avoidable deaths each year worldwide.

[02:45:27.300 --> 02:45:28.580]
This is in the Washington Post.

[02:45:28.960 --> 02:45:32.520]
Cigarette smoke is a deadly delivery device for a benign but habit-forming product.

[02:45:32.860 --> 02:45:33.340]
Nicotine.

[02:45:33.900 --> 02:45:36.500]
Nicotine isn't especially dangerous about like caffeine.

[02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:38.240]
Good policy toward tobacco.

[02:45:38.700 --> 02:45:44.060]
Use would reduce the grave harm of smoke by replacing cigarettes with non-smoked forms of nicotine for the addicts.

[02:45:44.220 --> 02:45:48.900]
They might use nicotine safely forever, if harmless delivery system were widely available.

[02:45:48.900 --> 02:45:58.640]
Instead, nicotine abstinence is the policy maker's only approach to tobacco like other abstinence campaigns, alcohol, prohibition, sexual abstinence before marriage, just saying no to drugs.

[02:45:58.940 --> 02:46:01.580]
This one is both more realistic and ineffective like all the other ones.

[02:46:02.040 --> 02:46:05.160]
The human cost of the nicotine abstinence policy is doleful.

[02:46:05.640 --> 02:46:11.300]
More than 430,000 U.S. deaths each year, one out of every five can be attributed to smoking.

[02:46:11.900 --> 02:46:15.620]
This is 10 times our death rate from car crashes, 30 times,

[02:46:15.620 --> 02:46:16.580]
and about 30,000.

[02:46:16.640 --> 02:46:21.620]
The rate from AIDS, and unprecedented toll, that's a testament to the inadequacy of 40 years of quit smoking policy.

[02:46:22.020 --> 02:46:25.100]
The Surgeon General reported smoking to be a health hazard back in 1964,

[02:46:25.720 --> 02:46:31.400]
but the net effect of smoking cessation messages since then is that between 4 and 5% of smokers put each year.

[02:46:31.920 --> 02:46:35.840]
Of the approximately 14 million Americans who tried to quit smoking year, but you're only two million succeed.

[02:46:36.420 --> 02:46:42.960]
That paid their leaves 45 to 60 million Americans smokers, more than a fifth of American adults, most of them smoke regularly, like George.

[02:46:42.980 --> 02:46:43.900]
He just knows most cigarettes.

[02:46:44.260 --> 02:46:44.500]
Great.

[02:46:44.500 --> 02:46:46.580]
Another million and so start smoking each year.

[02:46:46.700 --> 02:46:50.800]
In fact, all of the Americans alive today who ever smoke regularly happen and are still smoking now.

[02:46:51.440 --> 02:46:54.320]
Obviously, nicotine uses a popular intonation habit.

[02:46:54.780 --> 02:46:57.260]
Equally, obviously, tobacco policy is a failure.

[02:46:57.780 --> 02:47:02.060]
Surveys show that a majority of current smokers were like good alternatives to smoking, using ways of getting nicotine,

[02:47:02.440 --> 02:47:06.860]
but we won't tell nicotine uses that there are safe ways to continue to do the legal drug that they crave.

[02:47:07.320 --> 02:47:10.120]
Apparently our policy makers read to see these people get sick and die.

[02:47:10.480 --> 02:47:10.840]
That's right.

[02:47:11.340 --> 02:47:13.220]
Alternative nicotine delivery could be easy.

[02:47:13.500 --> 02:47:15.780]
Nicotine replacement therapy could work long term.

[02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:18.220]
Common, the packs are already available, but not to everyone.

[02:47:18.440 --> 02:47:19.300]
What the ISIS leave.

[02:47:19.900 --> 02:47:24.920]
Also, they are still approved only for short term use and can deliver only small doses inadequate for heavy users.

[02:47:25.440 --> 02:47:26.600]
Smokless tobacco would work.

[02:47:26.760 --> 02:47:28.040]
It comes in several forms.

[02:47:28.040 --> 02:47:34.740]
One is two in tobacco made famous by cowboys and ball players, but other forms are handier, less messy and far less dangerous than smoking.

[02:47:35.260 --> 02:47:39.620]
I thought people get lip cancer and mouth and all kinds of other answers from, huh?

[02:47:39.620 --> 02:47:42.620]
They add all kinds of evil poisons and those things.

[02:47:42.800 --> 02:47:43.320]
So I see.

[02:47:43.820 --> 02:47:49.840]
You have health officials label smokless tobacco as not a safe alternative to smoking, despite much evidence that it is quite safe.

[02:47:50.020 --> 02:47:51.460]
Oh, that is not so scuttle, I cramp it.

[02:47:51.800 --> 02:47:58.760]
Indeed, current policy is so what nicotine actually said, officials rely to discourage widespread use of smokless tobacco as a way of delivering the drug.

[02:47:59.160 --> 02:48:01.160]
Just to put a pinch between your cheek and gum.

[02:48:01.360 --> 02:48:02.800]
You have prepared to be satisfied.

[02:48:04.140 --> 02:48:12.640]
As Carl Phillips and epidemiologist at the University of Alberta has shown evidence points to a low risk of health hazards, stemming from smokeless tobacco use.

[02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:16.080]
That includes virtually no evidence of risk of oral cancer.

[02:48:16.560 --> 02:48:22.440]
Phillips calculations show that total mortality from smokless is about one hundredth of that from smoking, one hundredth.

[02:48:22.820 --> 02:48:24.800]
And then there's what many smokers nowadays really do.

[02:48:25.160 --> 02:48:29.440]
Mixed periods of abstinence encouraged by smoke free workplaces and restaurants with periods of light smoking.

[02:48:29.440 --> 02:48:41.220]
Mixing light of occasional smoking with other nicotine delivered products might even be safer, but it can't be studied as impossible alternative because current funding goes on into research and how to quit smoking, not finding a safe level of smoking.

[02:48:41.580 --> 02:48:53.680]
How shameful that the US is wanting to allow almost half a million Americans to die each year and that the WHO is prepared to allow up to five million annual deaths worldwide, all because of a delivery device cigarette smoke whose hazards are well known and largely avoidable.

[02:48:53.880 --> 02:48:56.280]
I never heard of anybody who died from second hand chaw.

[02:48:56.840 --> 02:48:58.580]
No, when you would let their spit in your face, no.

[02:48:58.580 --> 02:48:59.440]
Not that's true.

[02:48:59.780 --> 02:49:02.500]
We're in the usually progressive public health establishment on us.

[02:49:02.780 --> 02:49:05.620]
We are generally not giving it a telling people stop doing what you're doing.

[02:49:05.960 --> 02:49:14.140]
We prefer health promotion in a form of seatbelts, motorcycle helmets, condoms, syringes change, ingredient labels and warning labels, rather than forcing people to quit their habits.

[02:49:14.600 --> 02:49:18.860]
But with tobacco we've jettisoned our tolerance and throw all our support to nicotine abstinence.

[02:49:19.200 --> 02:49:22.640]
We can't ignore tobacco when it's one deadly disguise cigarette smoke.

[02:49:23.060 --> 02:49:26.900]
Neither should we ignore a deadly nicotine abstinence crusade disguised as tobacco control.

[02:49:26.900 --> 02:49:29.460]
It's that smoke man, second hand smoke.

[02:49:29.880 --> 02:49:33.000]
And guess what happens in Ontario on Thursday?

[02:49:33.680 --> 02:49:35.020]
I don't know, it's a big smoke out smoke.

[02:49:35.280 --> 02:49:36.460]
No, it's a draw.

[02:49:37.220 --> 02:49:39.180]
No more than smokeers, it falls you in Niagara.

[02:49:39.780 --> 02:49:42.320]
All indoor businesses, man, no moss, no more smoking.

[02:49:42.860 --> 02:49:43.880]
I like it.

[02:49:44.420 --> 02:49:50.140]
I just don't, I've never been one of those militant anti-smokers because they used to smoke a long long go when I was in college.

[02:49:50.500 --> 02:49:50.620]
Right?

[02:49:50.620 --> 02:49:57.840]
But it just, by the same token when you haven't smoked it a long time and when you're around people like you blow in your face, it's very annoying.

[02:49:58.120 --> 02:49:59.960]
By the same token? You can't talk on the smoking?

[02:50:00.580 --> 02:50:02.840]
I'm just telling you, I'm not talking about that kind of smoke.

[02:50:03.460 --> 02:50:07.540]
No, no, in a casino situation it can be downright oppressive depending on how many people are in a casino.

[02:50:07.820 --> 02:50:10.760]
Yes, and they always are dangling that baguette from their fingers in such a way.

[02:50:10.780 --> 02:50:15.480]
It's almost like they're looking out of the corner, they're at the angle to make sure it's all whopping right up in your push, you know?

[02:50:15.640 --> 02:50:19.620]
And you always have the bad luck of being right in the spot where the smoke is billowing so it goes right in your eye.

[02:50:19.620 --> 02:50:24.300]
Right, that's right in your eyes are cheering up and then when you hit the jackpot you can't even see the machine mine.

[02:50:24.320 --> 02:50:26.500]
You just hit a belgowaw, the wall, what happened?

[02:50:27.540 --> 02:50:28.900]
Yeah, hopefully, I don't think so.

[02:50:29.600 --> 02:50:33.960]
1041 votes on the Berry Bonds poll, Berry Day hates you man, they wish you would die.

[02:50:34.440 --> 02:50:37.060]
They wish that you'd get a tumor the size of your fat ass.

[02:50:37.480 --> 02:50:43.120]
What's your take on Berry Bonds, a 1041 votes without the Royads just another jock, 295.

[02:50:43.460 --> 02:50:44.520]
Just another jock.

[02:50:44.920 --> 02:50:46.800]
He couldn't lick the babes jock, 197.

[02:50:46.800 --> 02:50:49.240]
His stats are bogus 179.

[02:50:49.560 --> 02:50:50.480]
I hate baseball 97.

[02:50:51.080 --> 02:50:54.400]
He's good, not great, 88. He's okay. Never stole a freight train.

[02:50:54.720 --> 02:50:57.780]
And never, never got the failed the drug test, that guy was great.

[02:50:58.200 --> 02:51:00.900]
He's the greatest 68, jackpot at 20 times.

[02:51:01.500 --> 02:51:04.220]
I hate him 60 and I hate this pool only 57.

They like the Berry Bonds poll man.

[02:51:06.420 --> 02:51:07.440]

[02:52:31.420 --> 02:52:31.940]
This is Neo Roger.

[02:52:31.940 --> 02:52:31.940]

This is 5.62.

[02:53:15.320 --> 02:53:32.840]
Oh, that's probably forgetting something which was flawed?

[02:53:32.840 --> 02:53:32.840]

[02:53:32.840 --> 02:53:38.120]
And if I rose to, oh believe everything we can

That has to say

[02:53:58.440 --> 02:54:01.500]
We don't mind to see our God's role

[02:54:01.500 --> 02:54:04.520]
A by the time of these wolves

[02:54:05.640 --> 02:54:08.580]
We're fascinated by jail

[02:54:08.580 --> 02:54:09.940]
Welcome

[02:54:10.500 --> 02:54:13.060]
We're not stupid wolves

[02:54:13.060 --> 02:54:16.240]
All the hour is crazy

[02:54:16.240 --> 02:54:19.500]
The past has arid his way

[02:54:21.840 --> 02:54:23.340]
Everybody's turning back

[02:54:23.340 --> 02:54:26.760]
Yes, that's us USA

[02:54:26.760 --> 02:54:28.660]
What has that had to do with Taylor Hitch?

[02:54:28.800 --> 02:54:30.180]
An American idol, hey Taylor!

[02:54:31.080 --> 02:54:31.520]
BAAAMING!

[02:54:31.800 --> 02:54:32.480]
You're fairing!

[02:54:32.760 --> 02:54:34.860]
149, 112, we got GELDI coming up

[02:54:34.860 --> 02:54:38.240]
A man, this should tell you what women do to men

[02:54:38.240 --> 02:54:40.320]
This story epitomizes what it does

[02:54:40.320 --> 02:54:41.660]
And also about those cruises

[02:54:42.180 --> 02:54:44.200]
What I tell you when you're out there in the middle of the water

[02:54:44.200 --> 02:54:45.200]
And nowhere to go?

[02:54:45.620 --> 02:54:48.020]
A man returning from the British Virgin Islands

[02:54:48.020 --> 02:54:49.340]
on a cruise ship with his family

[02:54:49.340 --> 02:54:51.960]
Through himself into the Atlantic Ocean after arguing with his wife

[02:54:51.960 --> 02:54:54.540]
And couldn't be found despite a Coast Guard search

[02:54:55.180 --> 02:54:56.380]
Carnival cruise line said in a statement

[02:54:56.380 --> 02:54:58.400]
that his carnival legend vessel was on route from

[02:54:58.820 --> 02:55:00.640]
Tortola just after 1 a.m. Saturday

[02:55:00.640 --> 02:55:02.840]
When the passenger was seen jumping overboard

[02:55:03.260 --> 02:55:04.460]
That's a woman oldudia

[02:55:05.160 --> 02:55:06.000]
Yeah, that's right

[02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:07.180]
I know it's right

[02:55:07.180 --> 02:55:09.140]
The Coast, that's why they got all these widows

[02:55:09.140 --> 02:55:10.360]
And very few widowers man

[02:55:10.360 --> 02:55:11.540]
A woman looked to be like 90

[02:55:11.540 --> 02:55:13.140]
And the guys at 60 they croaked

[02:55:13.140 --> 02:55:15.520]
From the stress, from the agra, from the agita

[02:55:15.520 --> 02:55:19.120]
From the nudging, the kvitching, the nagging

[02:55:19.120 --> 02:55:21.940]
The Coast Guard said a C-130 airplane crew

[02:55:21.940 --> 02:55:23.440]
It's a helplot for the man

[02:55:23.440 --> 02:55:25.280]
But after 12 hours without fighting

[02:55:25.280 --> 02:55:26.920]
And they sent the cruise ship on its way to New York

[02:55:26.920 --> 02:55:28.520]
Where it talked last night or Sunday night

[02:55:28.520 --> 02:55:30.120]
The passenger said they were told the man

[02:55:30.120 --> 02:55:32.420]
A father of a young child had argued with his wife

[02:55:32.420 --> 02:55:34.920]
And his cabin before jumping over the balcony

[02:55:34.920 --> 02:55:37.980]
They said a collar bravo, bravo used to alert crew members

[02:55:37.980 --> 02:55:40.320]
To a serious incident, was heard over the ship's announcements

[02:55:40.320 --> 02:55:42.500]
Maybe they were just complimenting him on his dive

[02:55:42.500 --> 02:55:43.040]
That's right

[02:55:43.720 --> 02:55:44.540]
Eight point nine

[02:55:44.540 --> 02:55:46.420]
Right, even though 9.6

[02:55:46.420 --> 02:55:47.880]
Even though we decided to do that

[02:55:47.880 --> 02:55:49.080]
It was still upsetting for his family

[02:55:49.080 --> 02:55:49.960]
Everybody else on board

[02:55:49.960 --> 02:55:50.300]
No

[02:55:50.300 --> 02:55:50.540]
Oh

[02:55:51.420 --> 02:55:51.900]
Oh

[02:55:53.360 --> 02:55:55.480]
You people I know is crew ships man

[02:55:55.480 --> 02:55:57.720]
A sucker is born every minute I keep telling you

[02:55:57.720 --> 02:55:58.520]
God

[02:55:58.520 --> 02:56:00.640]
Speaking of a sucker born every minute getting

[02:56:00.640 --> 02:56:02.020]
Is wasting a lot of money

[02:56:02.020 --> 02:56:04.980]
I don't want to say I told you so but you know what

[02:56:04.980 --> 02:56:05.880]
Did you tell us so?

[02:56:06.200 --> 02:56:06.460]
Yes

[02:56:06.460 --> 02:56:08.440]
No for a township me to him

[02:56:08.440 --> 02:56:12.520]
The FBI is ending its two research of a suburban Detroit horse farm

[02:56:12.520 --> 02:56:15.140]
After finding no trace of Jimmy Hoffa's remains

[02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:16.840]
Open county

[02:56:16.840 --> 02:56:18.760]
Well maybe if he just got a rather one there

[02:56:18.760 --> 02:56:22.340]
He could open up out components vault again and find that empty wine bottle

[02:56:22.780 --> 02:56:27.100]
Open county prosecutor David Garcia, Dorsaka, whatever his name is, told the A&P

[02:56:27.100 --> 02:56:31.240]
He was informed by Bloomfield Township police that the search was ending without any remains found

[02:56:31.240 --> 02:56:33.360]
At the hidden dreams farm in Milford Township

[02:56:33.360 --> 02:56:35.400]
I could have told him that for a very small fee

[02:56:35.400 --> 02:56:36.440]
Just a few more

[02:56:36.440 --> 02:56:37.140]
Small, okay

[02:56:37.140 --> 02:56:37.920]
Oh I don't know

[02:56:37.920 --> 02:56:39.500]
You just cost for $6,000

[02:56:39.500 --> 02:56:40.480]
And I want that

[02:56:40.480 --> 02:56:41.820]
Oh I didn't know more to it

[02:56:41.820 --> 02:56:43.160]
I think there's more to it

[02:56:43.160 --> 02:56:43.880]
There's another kind of

[02:56:43.880 --> 02:56:45.900]
$1,000 and one kind of

[02:56:45.900 --> 02:56:46.640]
Yeah I know that

[02:56:46.640 --> 02:56:50.660]
FBI spokeswoman Dawn Clayton didn't immediately return to call from the A.P.C.

[02:56:50.760 --> 02:56:51.060]
Can come

[02:56:51.060 --> 02:56:52.000]
Let's do embarrassing

[02:56:52.640 --> 02:56:57.520]
Hoffa disappeared in July 1975 from a Detroit area restaurant about 20 miles from hidden dreams farm

[02:56:57.520 --> 02:56:59.800]
Land once owned by Hoppy Associates

[02:56:59.800 --> 02:57:00.880]
Rolled McMaster

[02:57:01.400 --> 02:57:02.240]
His attorney

[02:57:02.800 --> 02:57:06.300]
McMaster's attorney said he wasn't surprised the search was wrapping up with the mystery still unsolved

[02:57:06.300 --> 02:57:08.920]
We never expected there was anything there he said

[02:57:08.920 --> 02:57:12.280]
Adding that the FBI felt like pressure to respond to the tip

[02:57:12.280 --> 02:57:14.160]
Lest it seem it wasn't trying to solve the case

[02:57:15.500 --> 02:57:17.460]
First of all what if they do solve the case

[02:57:17.460 --> 02:57:20.940]
Yeah I mean this isn't exactly like Elvis where there are people running around

[02:57:20.940 --> 02:57:22.060]
Oh Jimmy Hoffa is still alive

[02:57:22.060 --> 02:57:24.440]
I saw him having a cup of coffee at Starbucks

[02:57:24.940 --> 02:57:26.740]
Nobody says Jimmy Hoffa is still alive

[02:57:26.740 --> 02:57:28.460]
He sleeps with a fish is okay

[02:57:28.940 --> 02:57:30.280]
Just like Luca Brasi

[02:57:30.720 --> 02:57:31.200]
That's right

[02:57:31.200 --> 02:57:34.060]
He sleeps with a mod killed him right like we don't know that

[02:57:34.060 --> 02:57:35.200]
Brasi sleeps with a fish

[02:57:35.200 --> 02:57:37.860]
Well he was on his way to meet with two mobsters who are crying out loud

[02:57:37.860 --> 02:57:39.620]
Didn't you see the movie with the...

[02:57:39.620 --> 02:57:39.900]
That's right

[02:57:40.320 --> 02:57:41.760]
It's Danny Navito is in the movie

[02:57:41.760 --> 02:57:42.240]
That is correct

[02:57:42.240 --> 02:57:44.140]
Right who do I always say is in it

[02:57:44.140 --> 02:57:44.800]
Ojo Peci

[02:57:45.340 --> 02:57:46.240]
And Jack Nicholson

[02:57:46.980 --> 02:57:48.520]
Jack Nicholson is in the Hoffa movie

[02:57:48.520 --> 02:57:49.560]
Wasn't he Hoffa?

[02:57:49.800 --> 02:57:50.240]
That's correct

[02:57:50.240 --> 02:57:51.600]
Now that you mentioned it

[02:57:51.600 --> 02:57:54.360]
Well I had a... I kind of soured on him after the shiny

[02:57:55.140 --> 02:57:55.540]
The...

[02:57:55.540 --> 02:57:58.120]
Yeah that was the only highlight of the whole movie

[02:57:58.120 --> 02:57:59.000]
That was the only good part

[02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:00.600]
That's it the big chase scene there

[02:58:00.600 --> 02:58:03.460]
No the big chase into that maze of...

[02:58:03.460 --> 02:58:04.300]
It was pretty amazing

[02:58:04.780 --> 02:58:05.300]
What's that?

[02:58:05.360 --> 02:58:07.560]
Through the house and everything with the axe and...

[02:58:07.560 --> 02:58:07.960]
Oh yeah

[02:58:07.960 --> 02:58:11.800]
And then there's also the chase scene at the end where in the snow where he's chasing the three of you

[02:58:11.800 --> 02:58:13.500]
That was a great big build up to nothing boy

[02:58:13.500 --> 02:58:14.880]
He flew that whole way

[02:58:14.880 --> 02:58:16.960]
He was gonna save them and you know...

[02:58:16.960 --> 02:58:17.540]
He's dead

[02:58:17.540 --> 02:58:18.900]
He died pretty quick in there

[02:58:18.900 --> 02:58:19.340]
That's right

[02:58:19.340 --> 02:58:20.780]
He's dead man

[02:58:21.920 --> 02:58:23.920]
Can we even say that anymore?

[02:58:24.120 --> 02:58:24.760]
Not anymore

[02:58:24.760 --> 02:58:25.220]
Oh

[02:58:26.560 --> 02:58:27.640]
Just like Joyce

[02:58:27.640 --> 02:58:29.920]
What channel he was watching when he was a...

[02:58:29.920 --> 02:58:31.600]
You know on his little vacation there?

[02:58:32.580 --> 02:58:33.480]
Yeah that's right

[02:58:33.480 --> 02:58:35.320]
Watching Glenn Rinker and Ann Bishop

[02:58:35.320 --> 02:58:37.520]
And the channel thing is the other thing in the theater

[02:58:37.520 --> 02:58:39.720]
Because originally started moving the theater in the downer

[02:58:39.720 --> 02:58:41.160]
And the crowd went on a...

[02:58:41.660 --> 02:58:42.480]
Gushry when a...

[02:58:42.480 --> 02:58:43.940]
Oh channel 10 with his news

[02:58:43.940 --> 02:58:46.060]
Well that's because they saw him in Bishop so they screeched

[02:58:46.060 --> 02:58:46.860]
I'd scream

[02:58:48.380 --> 02:58:50.700]
I wonder if Sandy Payton ever brought her body back

[02:58:51.460 --> 02:58:52.720]

And look at you go

[03:02:09.060 --> 03:02:10.800]

I can't confirm her

[03:02:27.560 --> 03:02:29.860]

[03:02:29.860 --> 03:02:31.440]

[03:02:36.640 --> 03:02:38.840]
He's gonna jump in jazz

[03:02:38.840 --> 03:02:40.000]
Now you see

[03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:42.580]
Do what the day is before we can paint

[03:02:42.580 --> 03:02:44.820]
A paid pilot keeps

[03:02:44.820 --> 03:02:46.180]
For the white house

[03:02:46.180 --> 03:02:47.720]
Grimming on designer wall

[03:02:47.720 --> 03:02:48.480]

[03:02:59.780 --> 03:03:00.060]
No

[03:03:00.060 --> 03:03:02.100]
You ain't got no clever lividies

[03:03:02.100 --> 03:03:03.140]

I don't want to talk to Farbeys

[03:03:12.600 --> 03:03:13.360]
Bye, bye, bye
