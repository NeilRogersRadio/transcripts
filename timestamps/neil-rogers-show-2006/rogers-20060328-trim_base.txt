[00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.860]
All right, 958 on sports radio, 560 QAM.

[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.920]
Or should say 560 as we go to Neal now.

[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.640]
It was somewhere in a while.

[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.420]
Well, but if you just say 560, what does that mean?

[00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.400]
The most important part of the day, the real 560.

[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.400]
Non-sports.

[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.340]
Oh. So how many hockey clubs you get this morning?

[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:21.820]
None.

[00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.360]
No.

[00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.460]
And I brought it up.

[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:24.740]
Six and a roll, man.

[00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:25.600]
They win every game.

[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.840]
They find the way to the bar and fill the run.

[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.240]
And they already came out.

[00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.360]
No, they rented a heap.

[00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.440]
That's what they care about.

[00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.100]
Get out of here.

[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.720]
If there wasn't any heated all, they still wouldn't care.

[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.540]
That's not so.

[00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.380]
Okay.

[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.360]
Yeah, it's just not.

[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.540]
They just don't care.

[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.440]
They care about the heat, believe me.

[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.860]
Okay.

[00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.200]
They care about it.

[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.380]
Yeah.

[00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.860]
But he's part of the heat.

[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.340]
Well, how come they don't care about...

[00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.960]
Guilty.

[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.260]
He does the Panther games.

[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.560]
Do you care about him?

[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.220]
About who?

[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.540]
Guilty?

[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.860]
Yeah.

[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.720]
He's okay.

[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.120]
He's no mole.

[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.380]
What the hell?

[00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.840]
He's probably guilty.

[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.080]
You got a problem with him now?

[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.360]
No.

[00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.100]
I got a problem with the New Sales Manager.

[00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.120]
He's...

[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.380]
What was the other guy you called him?

[00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.940]
He's Stiffy?

[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.400]
Yeah.

[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.400]
This is Stiffy with the Southern Droll.

[00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.260]
The...

[00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.120]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.400]
That's the only change of the accent.

[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.880]
I'm hearing that nasty echo again.

[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.880]
Air every day for like...

[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.240]
This is the second or third week in a row.

[00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.500]
Air every stinking day.

[00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:12.260]
Echo.

[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.720]
Echo.

[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.060]
Echo.

[00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.280]
Let's crack it up real loud.

[00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:15.900]
Oh, now I hear it.

[00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.260]
Huh?

[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.580]
Well, yeah, you hear it now because I got to my...

[00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.160]
I made it.

[00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.900]
I created it.

[00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.580]
So what's going on with you today?

[00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.320]
Marlins, baby.

[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.580]
We love those Marlins.

[00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.900]
They're really great.

[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.940]
1250 Marlins.

[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.680]
I'll deck them Marlins in the Metting Jupiter.

[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.420]
Oh, yeah.

[00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.340]
Early day, that means off the woodbind plunging my guts out.

[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.340]
So while I've been on the area, I noticed that there is a resignation in the White House.

[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.860]
Yeah, Andy Card, big deal.

[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.300]
Oh.

[00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.900]
Yeah, Bush is shuffling the deck and this card fell out.

[00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.940]
Very good.

[00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.340]
Andy Card, and that cute...

[00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.800]
Yeah, like it's a big deal.

[00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:47.940]
Like it's going to make a big difference.

[00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.760]
Nobody cares.

[00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.780]
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.960]
Yeah, I'm going to tell you seriously.

[00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.820]
Troist Radford, I very seldom get as angry as...

[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.520]
Yeah, you know, the sales department pisses us all off because they're incompetent.

[00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.920]
They're idiots.

[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.540]
But I may just have to hire a hitman to take care of this guy.

[00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.500]
He's just...

[00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.260]
Everything that I've worked for 30 years, I think it's very appropriate that it's right on the heels of this 30th anniversary.

[00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.480]
Every single thing that I've worked to a build for 30 years, they're dismantling it right now.

[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.040]
So I've taken down the Berlin Wall.

[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.380]
That's what they're doing to me.

[00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.400]
But again, take them out into the bank.

[00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.300]
Then I got my tax returns for my tax guy yesterday.

[00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.920]
Yeah.

[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.480]
Got a FedEx package.

[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.540]
Got a huge, the biggest refund ever coming in my life.

[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.320]
Huge.

[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.760]
Kind of like winning the Progressive Jackpot at Woodbind.

[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.280]
So I feel pretty good about that.

[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.760]
That's good.

[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.860]
Now you'll have extra money for that.

[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.100]
Give me some good plunging money for the summertime for that tough summer schedule.

[00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.420]
Those two at two weeks.

[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.640]
You know, the football players get those two at A's.

[00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.640]
I got those two at weeks.

[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:40.900]
Do you have a plan yet?

[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.680]
What do you mean?

[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:42.460]
Where are you going to go?

[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.140]
What do you mean where I'm going to go?

[00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.320]
I'm not going, what does that mean?

[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.000]
Where I'm going to go?

[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.500]
You've got someplace in the summer.

[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.540]
Oh, I'm going to Berlin.

[00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.040]
Oh, thank you very much.

[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.320]
Yeah.

[00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.500]
Well, we got the World Cup.

[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.900]
Ah, you like Berlin now.

[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.880]
I love Berlin.

[00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.400]
What do you mean I like Berlin now?

[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.560]
I've been going there for years.

[00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.560]
But you know, you like, you've talked about going to Italy.

[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.180]
You've talked, of course, about Amsterdam.

[00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.820]
But Berlin seems to have replaced those places.

[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.980]
Berlin, Cologne.

[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.700]
I love Germany.

[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.400]
I don't like Frankfurt or Hamburg so much, especially Frankfurt.

[00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.080]
That was horrible.

[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.960]
I had the best time of my life in Berlin.

[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.720]
Yeah, and what's not to like, man?

[00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:14.520]
It's a great place.

[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.520]
And it's just a wonderful city.

[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.860]
Yep.

[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.020]
Well, that's a course that we bombed it into the Stone Age in the world.

[00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.200]
And it was a great place for us.

[00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.560]
So they had to rebuild all those things.

[00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.840]
So it's beautiful and modern and just great.

[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.740]
It's very nice.

[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.240]
Anybody on any, anybody under the age of 40 is great.

[00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.800]
The old people are still like goose stepping.

[00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.100]
You know, they're still, they can just tell.

[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.860]
You get that feeling.

[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.580]
They're still all goose stepping a little bit.

[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.600]
Yep.

[00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.160]
Okay, what I'm saying.

[00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.840]
Kind of like the US government.

[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.340]
Goose stepping.

[00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.680]
I don't know if I ever told you this in up.

[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.120]
And when I went there years ago with the doffens,

[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.720]
they had a preseason game there.

[00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.140]
And I was working for a channel four at TVJ.

[00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:54.300]
And I did a feature on a guy who had been watching the he watched the wall come down

[00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:01.560]
He was a New York advertising executive and he moved to Germany and opened a chain of hot dogs stands in Eastern zone

[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.500]
Because they didn't have hot dogs in Germany. They have worst right other well every street corner is another

[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.260]
Brot worst store. Yeah, but worst. Yeah, well I love those bratwurst man

[00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.160]
There's nothing like it. You can't get I don't care where you go. You cannot get the bratwurst like in Berlin

[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:24.640]
That's right, but he brought high grades over there and he was very successful and he got the t-shirt concession at checkpoint Charlie

[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.580]
In fact, there's one place where I go. It's right next to a big supermarket where they have

[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.580]
Curry worst which is you know, and they what they do is they slice up the bratwurst and then they put

[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.940]
Curry stuff in with an I don't want any part of the salt and they get very insulted if you tell me you want

[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.480]
Brotwurst. Oh, man. No, I have brought was just a curry worst

[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:46.060]
So what you do is you say curry worst without the curry. Curry worst with mustard. Yeah, instead of the curry because I hate curry

[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.500]
Oh

[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.860]
Cabbage is not bad. Yeah, they'll keep you regular. Yes

[00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.880]
The food there actually is going

[00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:00.260]
That's amazing. It's just amazing to me that Germany and Netherlands are like side by each the right next to each other

[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.500]
Mm-hmm, and yet Germany's got such tremendous food and

[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.300]
Well, I mean the food in Holland is just the worst I've ever had in my life the world's worst

[00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.740]
Horrible you have to really search to find an edible meal. I'm not just talking about good

[00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.900]
I'm talking about edible even Mickey D's looks good even with a rat running around it there under the fryer deep fryer

[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.380]
Oh, God. Yeah, there's the same rat. It's like a pet I think

[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.380]
On the dam rack he runs around under the deep fryer just to make you feel at home

[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.080]
I guess and then right next to that is killer flu chicken

[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.900]
That great the way that American enterprises poisoning the whole world is good. We're killing everybody

[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.520]
This is kind of a silent warfare

[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.480]
It may take a while. We're going to eliminate them by attrition

[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.740]
Power lack of nutrition. Yeah, kind of like a few M sales department

[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.440]
I'm gonna tell you this new guy man. He came in here on Friday and he's he's buried himself with me

[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:55.020]
You know, he very loud and very full of crap, you know I guarantee you the Troy Stratford look me right in the eye

[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.300]
He told me yeah

[00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.780]
Yeah, he told you the same crap that he tells everybody okay, and you're buying it. That's the sad part Chris

[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.000]
Well, this is no regime, you know, oh and you're part you all you guys

[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.160]
Because you're there and I'm not thank God the sun is shining here. It's in the fifties every day

[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.120]
It's like spring for real now. It's beautiful

[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.480]
But you're there and all this Joel Bell and this new regime and everybody's gonna be a song dance

[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:21.380]
It's gonna be so great these people are like shoeless and clueless men. They're like the homeless. They're shoeless and clueless

[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:27.000]
I just I never see anything like it not that I care you understand just passing it along the audience likes it

[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.740]
Just unbelievable

[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.860]
Got called me yesterday said I won a gas and a contest words

[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:39.140]
Where do I find a radio station? It's just come to the corner of ives derri in 441 and look for the building where they're waving the white flags off

[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.780]
Surrender out the window that's us our windows don't open well

[00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.980]
Maybe they do now maybe some people have punched some holes in the wall

Well, Vegas today Beverly Hills tomorrow tired of a truck and drag her ass out there

Stiffy junior

[00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.180]
Stiffy with a draw. My god

[00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:07.040]
See when I went to school. We got the ballgame at 1250 today. Yeah. What are you complaining about you got to work an hour and a half and you're out

[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.960]
So in that hour we're ordinarily you'd have three breaks because you know, you're gonna be one short

[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:16.980]
Yeah, at least we are we do four breaks. So there's two breaks there could be a third one, but there just is many

[00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:21.480]
So I'm assuming if there aren't any spots or they just another oversight by a somebody who's leaving for the

[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.320]
I'm team time in a row. They're just they're oblivious man

[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:29.660]
Most people would would give and they give their left arm to have the kind of money in sitting in a

[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:35.020]
Tax exempt say account in a bank that slips through the hands of these people in a year

[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.360]

I've got my kit already to go just see the steam coming out of your heels as you take off you bet

[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:16.300]

But man, I still think Jerry Jones is crazy the boys are back to clown the boys are going down

[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.640]
I said the boys are back to clown

[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.180]
There's no

[00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:19.260]
You know that jerk who used to dance a lot every time it got the end over the sharpening in his socks

[00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:23.760]
And man he thought he was cool, but he was really not what a joke that's ever wrong

[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.220]
And that time at the Cowboys place

[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.520]

[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:44.100]
I said the boys are back to clown

[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.900]
There's no reason down the sound

[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.800]
That's it. She knows been hanging around

[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.900]
This is the only thing I know

[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:55.900]
The boys are back to clown

[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.620]
That boys were going down

[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.560]

[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.400]
Still, George is about 826 this morning last time I checked well

[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.800]
attitude that don't mean he's not a good ball player

[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:16.800]

It had its moment US Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia startled reporters in Boston just minutes after attending a mass

[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:38.440]
Sunday by flipping a middle finger to his critics

[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:39.720]
This is the

[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:44.640]
holier than now Antonin Scalia all of he does go duck hunting with a vice president

[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:50.740]
A Boston hailed reporter asked a 70 year old conservative Roman Catholic have he faced as much questioning over

[00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:53.700]
impartiality when it comes to issues separating church and state

[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:59.000]
You know what I say to those people Scalia replied making me obscene gesture and explaining that Sicilian

[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.720]
I didn't know that did you know that thought the Sicilian salute was with the

Well, maybe he was doing this is so you know when he was given the he was given the one finger salute

[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:11.480]
Okay, that's one of your head when the high court was caught making the gesture by a photographer

Oh, yeah, I'm sure we'll see that real soon. Don't publish that Scalia told a photographer

[00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:31.460]
I'm sure they'll go right along with that he was attending a special mass felores and politicians at the cathedral the holy cross

[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.140]
The interest and no Hank always says oh there cooked up about the heat

[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:05.320]
I think Josh would agree with me and well, even if you don't agree because I've ever been around too long

[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:08.840]
Even when there was no heat even when nobody gave a crap about the heat

[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.400]
He'd even want to heat absolutely stunk

[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:13.820]
The interest in the panthers on a scale of zero is minus infinity

[00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:15.800]
So they could be like every game the rest of the season

[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:19.760]
They could go ahead and of course if they get the playoffs and then continue winning then you'll see

[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:23.600]
Then just like that one magical year. We love the panther

[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:29.300]
I've got one have to bring Joe Lin back to town from Tennessee and she'll be singing and they'll be a winging and oh boy

[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:33.300]
That panbagging will be like knocking each other off. They'll be jumping on there so fast

[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:38.000]
Just like the old Mary go round you ever see Mary go round. Yeah, that's what I bet you do

[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.520]
We got 955 on that pool already effects. Look at us

[00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:44.360]

[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.480]
963. It's not even love at the clock yet

[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:50.740]
See so the audience is also accelerating their response because they know it we're in a big hurry today

[00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:55.980]
Just like Troy Stratford ought to be in a big hurry to hit that door and don't come back in but he is just you know something

[00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:59.940]
I think what we all ought to do everybody on the station. Let's give him all of our spots

[00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:02.740]
You know I'm saying yeah got what right here so by the end

[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:08.080]

[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.260]

I like the snores that say my bad, clumsy pain

[00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:47.680]
Was for real for real right he fell asleep on the air and

[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:52.880]
Which is easy to do when you're talking sports hey 1046 14 before 11 o'clock talk a lot faster

[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:57.360]
We got the Marlon game in less than in two hours and what four minutes nothing we're counting holy crap

[00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:03.240]
So guess what I did during that break not a douce no no nothing like that. Oh not yet right right there in the chair

[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:05.000]
Ordered a case of that pasta

[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.540]
I get you dream George got on there and order the dream fields pasta believe you me you'll love it

[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:15.460]
It's it tastes exactly like right like good quality regular pasta. That's all I need to know and

[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:20.660]
You know just don't go crazy. I mean all over your case you don't have to worry right now about carbs stuff like that

[00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:27.420]
But it's good for you do you yeah got an issue no do you have an issue what do you do a new study from Jacobs media

[00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:35.060]
Asked over 25,000 respondents from over 75 rock formatted radio stations about the response to Howard Stern's jump to serious

[00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:40.780]
And they said are you cereal the result show that Stern's move the winemain. Uh oh no no

[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:46.280]
They don't want to be like driven snout now. I know what I'm trying to read. Yes somebody might say

[00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:52.340]
It's uh you think it might be okay, but it's not the result show that Stern's move has indeed helped the satcaster

[00:35:52.340 --> 00:36:01.440]
Patrice or pasty subscriber rate of xm among rock fans. Hi ever roughly 70% of Stern's regular listeners say they have not followed him and stuck with commercial radio morning shows

[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:09.020]
The study shows that the popularity of series and xm basically are dead even each with six percent of those who say they're likely to subscribe this year

[00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:14.480]
Series does rank ahead of xm. All the xm's got 80 billion channels on arrow nose picking channels

[00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:19.540]
Unsurprisingly Stern is the key factor in serious subscriptions decided by a third of respondents

[00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:25.200]
However the study also shows that Stern fans who plan on switching to serious most of them already have done so

[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:29.680]
Most of his fan survey who were following him to series have already signed up for the smaller percent same

[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:34.340]
They'll buy serious later in the year looking just at markets where Stern was on the year in 2005

[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:40.120]
A fifth of those survey to consider themselves regular listeners to show have already subscribed to series with one and ten

[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:41.520]
Indicating they plan to do so

[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:42.760]
According to a Jacob study

[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:48.420]
This is a strong indicator that for commercial radio broadcasters and former Stern markets the worst is over

[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:53.460]
However the majority of Stern's formula to regular listeners have just stayed with the rest of your radio morning shows in their market

[00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:58.400]
So once the ratings come out many morning shows should expect growth in their audience faces in Stern's absence

[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:02.640]
On average defections to serious for no greater among listeners of former Stern stations

[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:06.900]
However some former Stern stations were able to retain a much higher percentage of his audience for his replacements

[00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:09.220]
In other cases defections were quite higher than average

[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:13.740]
It's got charts and graphs and but it'd be but it'd be but about the this station in that market

[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:19.420]
46% of regular Stern listeners have stayed with the station's new morning show whatever you know they replaced him with

[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:24.040]
Three of Stern's former competitors are their morning shows attract almost six of every ten of his ex-lushners

[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:30.260]
Acquited Jacob's this could indicate that the upcoming round of arbitrarian ratings will show some very impressive growth among morning shows in recent months

[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.240]
So they're kind of like flattened out

[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:38.220]
The big semester we're all going out of business big see if we have problems here at QA and it's not got under new with XM and serious

[00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:43.900]
That's it right now even with that stiff competition from far out how can we compete with far out? You know what I'm saying right

[00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:49.860]
We'll do our best country radio speaking of that may be ready to make nice with the DC chicks

[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:55.820]
The grudge dates back to 2003 with many countries stations stop playing the popular trio after leasing your Natalie means

[00:37:55.820 --> 00:38:01.000]
Criticized present and push ripped him a fat ass nice going you go Natalie. We love the DC chicks

[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.600]
In fact, George says we love chicks with hits. Yeah those two

[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:10.020]
But the chicks new single not ready to make nice is now in rotation in several major markets pushing it's an pushing it's a number

[00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:14.380]
36 on billboards company sales charts after its first awake of air play other stations

[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:18.460]
Hi, I've ever been slower to embrace it. I think a lot of people are in kind of a wait and see modes had weighed

[00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:22.680]
Jess and director billboards country charts the next couple weeks are gonna really tell the tale

[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:26.800]

[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:30.840]
And that he was from their former other homestay the Texas back in the U.S

[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:35.980]
The music was boy-cutted and the chicks said they received death threats leading them to install mentally textures at their shows

[00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.780]
See you can't criticize this president you get death threats

[00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:42.980]
mains later since she regretted the phrasing of her remark or remained passionately against the war

[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:49.100]
In January she told entertainment weekly magazine that she was disappointed with country music and that she's pretty much done with the genre

[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:53.920]
Well good about time he came under the human race. Okay. It's that that knows pick-and-c country crap

[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:58.100]
God is that horrible stuff. The only worse than country crap is rap crap

[00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:02.080]
In stores made 23rd the new album taking the long ways produced by Rick Rubin

[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:05.880]
Primarily a rock and rap producer also crafted Johnny Cash's last albums

[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:12.440]
The record has been described as more rock-oriented featuring musicians from the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Tom Petty's band the heartbreakers

[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:17.680]

Police were responding to a call after traffic was blocked at 251 in the morning outside the snatch rock and roll bar and lounge

[00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:18.480]

As played the last two seasons with a Philadelphia Eagles he played in 16 games last season recording 70 tackles and one

Interception originally drafted out of Michigan by the Giants where he played for a season

[00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:47.280]
See that explains that he's from Michigan. That's why he just don't obey the law and he just out there dancing in the street

[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.820]
Lesson kind of a jackass

What solid is your brain?

[00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:14.660]

[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:16.340]

[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:31.940]
Well he's older than 30 and all of his parts are so my quality says so

[00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:33.260]
Call it quiz

[00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:35.940]
He's been there for a while

[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:38.420]
All his clothes on a sky

[00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:41.940]
He's got gray hair under his armpits

[00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:45.540]
All my 60 minutes is sad

[00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:47.860]
They're losing their granddad

[00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:51.400]
But like Wallace says it's time he goes

[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:54.880]
Cause it's here in Chatham

[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:56.820]
He's cleaned the lot

[00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:00.460]
He's got something in out of his nose

[00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:08.260]
And he wears glasses when windshield wipers are underneath his room

[00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:14.000]
He's got tight fur, he's got cataracts

[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.980]
Have a few hard times

[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:24.080]
He's got livers but say they just did his truth

[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:28.520]
He has enough time making food

[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:31.080]
We've ever gone mad

[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:34.500]
It's here like Wallace

[00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:42.580]
So I've said about 100 natural woods when he's been there snapping luricking suspenders

[00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:43.820]
And squeezing lurries bag

[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:44.540]
That was pretty good

[00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:48.640]
And his bizarre Martian son Chris Wallace was on her too from Fox News

[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:49.480]
That was okay

[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:51.760]
Christian Convert vanishes after release

[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:54.540]
I can't imagine why he made a quick b-line

[00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:55.580]
Still far to his head

[00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:57.260]

[00:45:57.260 --> 00:46:01.140]

[00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:04.520]
An Afghan man would face the death penalty for converting from Islam to Christianity

[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:09.160]
Quickly vanished today after he was released from prison

[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:12.160]
Apparently out of fear for his life with Muslim prayer still demanding his death

[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:13.400]
They're hot on his twale

[00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:19.200]
Italy's foreign minister Gianfranco Fini said he would ask his government to grant Abdul-Rashman asylum

[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:21.780]
Fini was among the first to speak out in the man's behalf

[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:23.720]
He can hide in the Colosseum where he'll be safe

[00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:25.140]
Or maybe it lilies in the Bronx

[00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:28.000]

[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:28.440]

[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:31.020]
Remember life in Luigi with Jake Hill Nash? No you don't

[00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:43.140]
Oh well it never went through

[00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:45.140]
I know it went through but that don't mean she got it

[00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:46.420]

Double check it triple check it quite I don't want to excuse this come April 25

[00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:53.260]
I don't want to get a check from like about 16 cent

[00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:54.740]
Because that's about what it'll be

[00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:56.920]
Based on the way things are going when that sales department

[00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:58.080]

[00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:06.900]
Rothman 41 was released from the high security polotersky prison on the outskirts of Kabul

[00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:08.720]

Mohamed Sanwara Danish told his subject at press Danish

[00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:17.460]
Wow man you thought he'd have changed his name after those cartoons right now that's been this

[00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:21.920]
We released him last night because the prosecutors told us to we said his family was there when it was freed

[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:25.960]
I'm aware he was taken somewhere where he'll be safe far away

[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:31.060]
Deputy Attorney General Mohamed Ishak Aloko said the prize is there anybody over there not name Mohamed

[00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:37.060]
Anybody said prosecutors had issued a letter calling for washmans for these because he was mentally unfit to stand trial

[00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:41.520]
He also said he didn't know where washman had gone after being released but they sure like to find him for a little chat

[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:44.200]
He said Rothman maybe sent overseas for medical treatment

[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:49.140]
On Monday hundreds of clerics students and others chanting death to Christians

[00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:54.600]
March through the northern afghan city of Mazir Aisha reef to protest the court decision sunny to dismiss the case

[00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:58.380]
Several Muslim clerics straight into its side afghans to kill Rothman if he's freed

[00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:01.740]
Saying that he is clearly guilty of apostasy and deserves to die

[00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:04.300]
Several Muslim clerics keeping that in mind

[00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:08.820]
Abdul Rothman must be killed Islam demands it said senior cleric Faiz Muhammad

[00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:14.620]
There's another one from the nearby northern city of Kanduz the Christian foreigners occupying Afghanistan are attacking our religion

[00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:18.920]
Oh, it's the religion is again they're all killing each other how unusual how unique

[00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:25.140]
Rothman was arrested last month after police discovering with a Bible a Christian Bible no less during custody dispute over two daughters

[00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:29.620]
It was put on trial last weekend for converting 16 years ago I thought it was 14 years ago

[00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:35.060]
Well a long time ago while he was a medical aid worker for an international Christian group helping Afghan refugees in Pakistan

[00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:41.060]
That'll treat teach you goi and stay in hell out of there for Christ's sakes he faced the death penalty under afghanistan's Islamic laws

[00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:49.200]
The case had often outcry in the US and other nations that helped out the hardline Taliban in late 2001 and provided military support for Afghan president Karzai

[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:51.380]
Who's probably still on the board over a unicale

[00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:54.680]
President Bush others had insisted Afghanistan protect personal beliefs

[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:59.060]
U.N. spokesman Aadman Edwards had rockman announced for asylum outside afghanistan

[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:05.200]
Femiy the Italian foreign minister was also deputy premier will seek permission to grab Rothman asylum at a cabinet meeting tomorrow

[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:11.420]
Femiy at earlier express at least indignation over the case even the pope appealed to Karzai for to protect the Rothman

[00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:18.920]
Right protect the Rothman baby that's where it's at the Rothman they didn't respond to the Pope's you know request

[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:37.880]
it a long distance sniff it's remarkable how Scarlett Johansson has caught the attention of our readers at Scott Gremlin the magazine US editor in chief

[00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:44.960]
her self-revoisin striking beauty certainly have a lot to do with that but she does have but so does the confidence she exudes she's

[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:49.920]
exuding it and extruding it she seems to be one of those women would be equally at ease on the red carpet as

12 minutes past 11 a q and we got the marlins on deck marlins and the mits 105 man lot of interest in our part

[00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:26.080]
good

[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:26.600]

[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:26.900]
the

[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:32.300]
things that I hope were not

[00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:33.440]
true

[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:35.180]
close the door and

[00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:36.680]
love it real tight

[00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:46.860]
make sure my best work in for the night didn't really know what else I could do even broke out the

[00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:52.860]
glitch

[00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:53.680]
thank my

[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:54.240]
full

[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:54.240]

[00:56:54.240 --> 00:57:00.300]
that

[00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:09.900]
he

[00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:12.500]
I was turning through when the world gets raw

[00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:17.180]
I don't know what to do, please don't ignore how to be

[00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:21.560]
I hope he didn't get thrown for the time

[00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:28.740]
That sure was it could be, but just in case I'm growing up I'm all free

[00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:32.040]
I hope it's not as bad as I think

[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:37.080]
It might be called the CDC

[00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:44.600]
1117 at 560 WDQ I'm happy to see you today

[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:46.820]
We should put Randy Johnson on the pool, you know what?

[00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:47.260]
Okay

[00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:48.420]
Do you think so, Josh?

[00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:49.640]
I guess so

[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:52.000]
I think we were getting news today about Randy last year

[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.140]
His secret love child

[00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:55.280]
Didn't see the story about his secret love child?

[00:57:55.660 --> 00:57:56.040]
I did not

[00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:57.700]
Oh, well we got that. It's coming

[00:57:57.700 --> 00:57:58.820]
We got to say that in a secret anymore

[00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:00.920]
Randy Johnson, no it ain't

[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:02.680]
Most she's how old is she? She's a 16

[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:06.100]
So it's an old story, but it's just making breaking news

[00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:06.980]
Breaking news

[00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:09.000]
How's Angela Ray doing? She's still an idiot?

[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:09.480]
Yeah

[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.740]
It saves one of those rhetorical questions

[00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:14.000]
It's like our sales department, are they still incompetent?

[00:58:14.060 --> 00:58:14.200]
Yeah

[00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:16.240]
New sales guy still got that sudden draw

[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:16.760]
Yeah

[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:18.620]
He looked me right now

[00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:19.880]
He looked me right now

[00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:21.220]
And said, yeah well guess what?

[00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:22.900]
He gave you a pile of crap, okay Chris?

[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:26.080]
He'll start to recognize the smell

[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:28.580]
The various crap and words coming from

[00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:29.380]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:30.000]
What he said

[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:30.760]
Oh

[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:34.860]
Doug Thompson writes, the continued madness of King George

[00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:37.640]
This is Capitol Hill Blue, your very favorite website

[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:39.280]
If you turn you around on that

[00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:47.980]
With all the public fear over his use of the National Security Agency to spy on Americans and the near mutiny and the Republican Party over his high handed approach to the presidency

[00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:51.240]
You think George W. Bush might have learned a thing or two about the dangers of arrogance

[00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:58.620]
Now, not our despot in Chief King W. When he signed the extension of the USA Patriot Act in the law he added his own addendum to the law that says

[00:58:58.620 --> 00:59:05.280]
He doesn't have to tell time was a damn thing about what he and his dorm troopers are up to when it comes to abusing the expanded police powers and including the bill

[00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:12.620]
After the public ceremony Bush issued a signing statement that reiterated an impact Bush's belief that the Constitution is just a gd piece of paper

[00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:18.140]
He doesn't feel constrained by a law or obligated by provisions of the act that require a uniform congress in a timely manner

[00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:23.840]
I'm just what the FBI and other parts of his American Gestapo were up to when it comes to snooping into the private lives of Americans

[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:29.680]
The executive branch will construe the provisions I call for furnishing information to entities outside the executive branch

[00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:36.800]
In a matter of consistent with the president's constitutional authority to supervise the unitary executive branch and withhold information from Congress and of course the public

[00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:48.240]
Bush said Bush says he'll withhold information if he and only he decides disclosure would impair foreign relations, national security, the deliberative process of the executive or the performance of the executive's constitutional duties

[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:54.520]
The president's latest display of I am above the law arrogance might have gone unnoticed because most of the media concentrate on the public

[00:59:54.520 --> 01:00:00.920]
Trump and circumcised that ignored the real story Charlie Savage of the Boston Globe was one of the few who reported on the signing statement

[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:10.580]
Yet Savage's story fell off the media landscape with a resounding thud as the rest of the mainstream was apparently cow-toed by Bush's threats to all reporters and editors in front of grand juries if they dear

[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:18.240]
Right about his abuse of the Constitution and the use of US spy agencies to snoop on Americans stuck with reporting on the president's latest road show to sell the failed Iraq war

[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:25.700]
Frankly, I'm surprised that political scientist George Harley who worked in the Nixon and Reagan White Houses I thought the story would have legs and get much more attention

[01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:31.900]
After all the debate in Congress over the need for the president to keep them in the loop he simply signs away one of the key provisions of the revised act

[01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:38.420]
The revised USA Ppud Act emerged from Congress of the number of oversight provisions requiring the president to report to the Hill on a strict timetable

[01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:44.920]
One of those provisions said the White House had to tell Congress just how the FBI used the expanded wiretapping surveillance powers granted under the act

[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:50.160]
Some in Congress like Senator Patrick Leahy are pissed off his health at the president's claim that he's above the law

[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:55.820]
The president's signing statements are not the law and Congress should not allow them to be the last word Leahy said in a statement issued by the Orifice

[01:00:55.820 --> 01:01:02.480]
The president's constitutional duty is to faithfully execute the laws is written by the Congress not to cherry pick the laws he decides he wants to follow

[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:06.280]
It is our duty to ensure by means of congressional oversight that he does so

[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:13.860]
Constitution law professors say Bush could be bluffing but history shows that Bush bluffs first and then goes ahead and does what he wants if nobody calls the bluff

[01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:17.880]
David Golov a New York University law professor and expert on presidential power

[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:25.640]
She was told a Boston Globe that Bush's actions display a mind-bogglingly expansive conception of his power and the White House's blatant disregard for the role of Congress

[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:31.280]
On the one hand they deny that Congress even has the authority to pass laws on these subjects like torture and eavesdropping

[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:35.980]
In addition to that they say Congress is not even in television information about anything to do with the war on terrorism

[01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:42.740]
Golov said Bush's actions are just another example of a madman who appears determined to destroy the Constitution and a country called America

[01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:50.380]
Unfortunately this madman will continue to wreak havoc until somebody puts a stop to his insanity since dark times stop the insanity

[01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:52.060]
Is never what your name said?

[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:52.660]
Susan powder?

[01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:53.680]
Who was it?

[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:54.440]
Susan powder

[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:56.600]
Oh Susan powder I forgot all about that bitch

[01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:57.220]
Oh yeah

[01:01:57.220 --> 01:02:01.340]
You'll be happy to know she's got dreadlocks now and big old tattoo under chest

[01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:02.300]
Oh no

[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:03.960]
What a guy

[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:04.460]
Yeah

[01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:05.600]
Holy moly

[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:06.840]
Look at that phone man

[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:09.820]
I thought we'd interspersed here a little bit we only got an hour and a half to go

[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:34.540]
I guess we won't

[01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:37.480]
I think to save some money for the company might as well take the phone out

[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:38.240]
Oh please

[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:40.660]
I mean oh that would be wrong

[01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:41.860]
That would please you

[01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:44.860]

There's a guy that's a guy in the draft his name is the brickishaw

[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:35.120]
And he actually has a process

[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:35.560]
Yeah I know that

[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:37.820]
Right I know the brickishaw

[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:40.940]
Maybe he was the

Maybe he was the Hansing in the street

[01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:44.800]

Anyways how come you guys have a sponsor now that of this?

Do you know that we took good care? I wouldn't notice that if not for you

[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:17.500]
How do I did that get my facts?

[01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:18.380]
I didn't check it

[01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:22.200]
Don't don't wait because we're gonna be out of here before you can say it's your bribble man

Hello Neil yes sir. Yes sir how about putting a mic Schmidt?

[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:49.460]
Old news small potatoes mic Schmidt only the Philly fans hated him nobody nobody cares about that right Josh?

[01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:51.520]
Why did the Philly fans hate him? He was awesome

[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:56.420]
The big the hit everybody because he struck out a few times who don't know is made a couple of errors a third base

[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:10.720]

[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:39.740]
Least madness and March at beach Ford means you got to be mad enough to take advantage of rebates and discounts

[01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:44.520]
About the 10 grand on all new and used vehicles if you're not in the market for a new car

[01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:49.380]
But no somebody who was sent them into beach Ford because if they take delivery this month beach Ford will send you 200 bucks

[01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:55.580]
And that money comes from their advertising budget. They will absolutely not tack it under your friends price and piss him off or her or it

[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:25.940]
He was driving home from dinner when a DeCalb County police officer pulled her over at least initially

[01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:29.240]
I was just surprised because I had done anything wrong. She's it when he approached the car

[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:33.720]
He had his hand on his weapon and I was in my nurses uniform with a stethoscope around my neck

[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:38.680]
Sounds like something from crash. Mm-hmm. He asked for my license and then said any idea why I stopped you

[01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:41.300]
I said no you have a lured decal on your car

[01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:45.960]
He said Greer said she immediately thought that one of her kids had put something nasty on her bumper as a joke

[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:48.880]
Then he mentioned the bush thicker she said the one that says I'm tired of all the

B-U-S-H-I-T the story first reported by Joe Johnson to the Athens banner hero that says remember Joe Johnson

[01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:55.880]
I was talking about him just the other day. Yes

[01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:01.240]
Greer said she told the officer it wasn't lured and that it was clearly a political statement when he insisted it was lured

[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:05.300]
She said I'm not going to discuss this any further just give me the ticket which he did under offense

[01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:09.800]
It said lured decals the tickets for a hundred bucks Greer has no intention of paying it

[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:12.260]
I'm so appalled that the officers attempt to squash my freedom of speech

[01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:17.240]
He told the banner hurled elaborating to the progressive rear says people are wrong to view this in a partisan way

[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:21.400]
I'm not just it's not just a Democrat Republican issue. She says y'all need to get beyond that

[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:25.220]
It's my right to speak in yours y'all need to get beyond that she said y'all

[01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:31.100]
Jerry Weber the legal director of the ACLU of Georgia's representing Greer the indicators are that the officer didn't like her

[01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:37.200]
Views of president Bush and that was the motivating factor he says Weber says the ticketing was clearly ill legal and totally

[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:44.180]
Acceptable they labeled unacceptable. He says the Georgia Supreme Court struck down the Lut bumper sticker statute way back in 1991

[01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:47.640]
In a case involving a defendant who had a Schmidt happens bumper sticker

[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:51.820]
They shouldn't keep happening 15 years later he says after the criminal cases over

[01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:56.900]
Weber says he and Greer may file a civil rights claim good. Sue their ass billions of dollars. Okay bring that

[01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:58.160]

We won't don't comment other officers ticket set officer Herschel's grand gen who handles media affairs

The officer is making his decision on the street that's going through legal channels now

[01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:14.820]
By the way, this is in the first time someone in Greer's family's gotten trouble over a bumper sticker last year or 20 year old

[01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:21.140]
Sun was pulled over in Athens, Georgia for having a bumper sticker that said oh, no, I can't read that don't do it

She says the police officer told her stun if you don't remove the bumper sticker

[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:45.800]
I'm taking you to jail so he removed it. He thought it was kind of funny

[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:51.260]
She says though she told him she'd rather hand go to jail and take her bumper sticker off Greer has a court date of April 18

[01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:54.980]
How do you like that? That's a good one

[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:58.680]
Between her lies and now she is with child and her names and

[01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:04.400]
This exit that hotel

[01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:07.280]
They

[01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:43.860]
Oh

[01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:45.760]
Oh

[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:46.220]
Д

[01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:47.980]
Never

[01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:56.540]
Oh, right has got my new friend

[01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:01.700]
It's nearly my fault since she's been out by the assortment

[01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:06.940]
That only two raiders this world wide are holding

[01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:12.820]
Old Brad doesn't mind the baby, looks a bit jinnies

[01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:18.260]
It's like joining the U.N. World of End with that Selena Jolie

[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:21.860]
The world where kids I sold them to the lady in Costa Rica

[01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:23.980]
So I said how much you liked them?

[01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:25.360]
We have buffaloes and kids

[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.700]
When you get a run cycle of Nordic swimsuits

[01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:30.700]
Our kids are really track and are you ready to?

[01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:31.700]
Yes!

[01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:34.880]
Yeah, what if they're gonna have crater phase like daddy?

[01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:36.080]
I hope they wear a lot of makeup

[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:41.540]
Levent 48, yes that's proof right there that not everything in life is as it appears to be, you know?

[01:19:41.660 --> 01:19:41.820]
Right

[01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:43.800]
Which we already know that, especially here

[01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:44.740]
But it's like a close-up

[01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:46.880]
Randy Beans Ma of Love Child

[01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:52.000]
Yankee Ace Sui X Gallup Pal over payments for girl 16

[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.620]
This is in the New York Daily News

[01:19:53.620 --> 01:19:55.920]
Randy Johnson, did we put him on air or not?

[01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:56.780]
Yeah, we put him on air

[01:19:56.780 --> 01:19:59.980]
And he's got one vote probably her, probably the daughter

[01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:02.280]
Randy Johnson has a secret love child

[01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:05.020]
Well, if it's good enough for Jesse Jackson, well, you're good enough for Randy, huh?

[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:09.000]
And the Yankee superstar is playing a hard ball with the girls' mom was revealed yesterday

[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.540]
The famous heroine left you make 16 million a year as Sui X's girlfriend Laura Rozel

[01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:16.620]
for less than 100 grand in child care payments for their daughter Heather

[01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:20.460]
Now 16, according to Corvip papers revealed by the smoking gun website

[01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:24.100]
Oh, really, Roberto Rozel or as a Laurel's mother told that he tried New Year's Day

[01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:25.720]
But told the lawsuit, that sounds like Randy

[01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:28.400]
In fact, the original headline on this story was

[01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:31.180]
Big Unit has a small unit

[01:20:31.180 --> 01:20:31.760]
Really?

[01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:33.040]
Yes, that's cute

[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:37.780]
The striking troll athletic looking teen refused to talk when she came to the door of her family's home

[01:20:37.780 --> 01:20:40.060]
Overlooking a picturesque bay in Washington State

[01:20:40.060 --> 01:20:43.540]
The big unit yesterday admitted fathering the childering in a fair when he was a

[01:20:43.540 --> 01:20:46.360]
Lanky rookie with an asked the fast ball in a bright future

[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:50.460]
But Johnson insisted he's always tried to do right by the girl despite his mind dispute with her mama

[01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:54.780]
I do acknowledge I have a daughter from a previous relationship which ended years before my marriage

[01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:56.060]
Johnson for a two-zennestayman

[01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:59.400]
I fully financially supported her and have made every effort to protect her privacy

[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:03.060]
Laura Rozel, 46, is working at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab in Northern California

[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:07.460]
When she started going out with Johnson, a Californian that made it in late 88

[01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:11.120]
She broke up with the future super star midway through a pregnancy and called a daughter

[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:15.300]
His dark little secret in an interview with the smoking gun, his little dark secret

[01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:16.200]
What do you mean?

[01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:19.760]
I'm saying that a little bit on the way up there, we don't have no picture

[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:20.080]
No

[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:25.420]
Rozel said Johnson only saw the girl one soon after her birth and said that he never made any effort to be involved in her life

[01:21:25.420 --> 01:21:28.960]
Nope, nothing ever she told her wife someone asked about Johnson's relationship to the girl

[01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:33.320]
Court papers reveal that Johnson first agreed in 1997 to pay five grand a month in child support for

[01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:37.560]
Heather Rozel, plus another 750 bucks in monthly daycare expenses

[01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:44.020]
Laura Rozel claimed things turned sour last year when she asked the all started by Heather Recarr and put the bill for community college classes

[01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:47.100]
He fired back with illegal equivalent of a high-hard fastball

[01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:50.680]
The man named that she retired about 71 grand in daycare payments

[01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:55.080]
Plus 26 grand in interest because the teen was too old to be in daycare legal paper show

[01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:57.780]
Yeah, I don't think when you're 16 you go to daycare, do you?

[01:21:58.100 --> 01:21:58.100]

[01:21:58.100 --> 01:22:03.320]
My daughter was 16 hasn't been in daycare for at least five years Johnson said legal after they've filed paperwork third

[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:07.720]
Rozel should not have received a windfall for expenses that she didn't incur you go unit

[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:16.100]
Johnson known for intimidating opposing her with his icy stare and a hundred mile hour fastball became a board again Christian in 1992 after the death of his father

[01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:19.120]
He married his wife Lisa soon after with the couples got four children

[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:24.220]
The sometimes ornery six foot ten hurler got off to a bad start with the New York media last year

[01:22:24.220 --> 01:22:27.780]
When he grappled with the photographer in the TV cameraman after signing with the bombers

[01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:35.960]
Observers will be funneled at Johnson with foul lawsuit over what amounts to chum change for the millionaire all while risking a wanted publicity on intensely private matter

[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:40.640]
He had an uneven season last year but is the ace of the bomber staff penciled in the start opening day

[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:43.900]
Well, he's the ace of their staff maybe they'll have a bad year with only hope and pray

[01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:47.420]
Oh God, the Yankees

[01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:51.540]
Oh man, oh Larry bird, okay, let's get him on there right away

[01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:52.740]
Got him on her yet?

[01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:53.500]
He's out there

[01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:58.980]
Facts is not only is Larry bird any literate racist but he's also a deadbeat dead he needs to be on today's pool

[01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:06.540]
Also, even if he wasn't a little bit or it wasn't a racist white guys who played basketball are like black Republicans, gay Republicans, female Republicans, Jewish Republicans, etc.

[01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:09.120]
Complete any jackballs who should be taken out in a shot

[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:11.280]
Wow, there's no need for them on this earth

[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:18.500]
Well, what about the y'all and the Chinese guy for Houston? What's his name? Y'all mean? Y'all? Y'all? Y'all? Y'all come back?

[01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:23.260]
So yeah, Larry bird, I hate him, I want to smash his face and it says I feel better not have a great effing day

[01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:24.980]
Ha ha ha ha, right!

[01:23:25.260 --> 01:23:26.420]
Get it out of your chest

[01:23:26.420 --> 01:23:30.260]
That's the idea with these poles baby, get it out of your system, turn it loose

[01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:35.560]
Like what's your name used to say, Sammy Smith, he's dead now and that song helped me make it through the night, turn it loose

[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:39.140]
That's that culture thing, you know, turn it loose and uh oh God

[01:23:39.140 --> 01:23:41.580]
Jerry Wittsner, he's been dead a long time, you know what?

[01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:43.840]
So many dead radio people and so little time

[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:46.680]
We got almost 1200 votes can you believe it's 1185

[01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:51.680]
That is sensational, Larry Burgess went on her, he and Charles Barkley will have any of it

[01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:55.820]
Oh and there she has Sammy Smith, she still, you can out the hits

[01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:57.140]
Help me

[01:23:57.140 --> 01:23:59.300]
Make the rhythm from my

[01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:00.900]
Make it through the witch me show

[01:24:00.900 --> 01:24:03.100]
Hi Jared, it's Chubby Check them in

[01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:04.240]
Make it loose

[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:06.920]
Now do you ever hear that show, do you ever hear it Wittsner?

[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:08.420]
No, I never had that

[01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:10.500]
I remember the Witts' news days as before your time

[01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:11.180]
Oh, sorry

[01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:13.700]
It wasn't a talk radio in those days or in these days

[01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:15.340]
Good choice, me either

[01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:17.620]
Help me make it, oh boy that was something

[01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:20.640]
He had like a one book, he had a 33 share during Wittsner

[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:22.380]
What does that tell you about the old parts?

[01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:25.520]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, run to a lot of pressure here man

[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:27.120]
We got less than an hour before that pregame

[01:24:27.580 --> 01:24:29.180]
57 minutes but who's counting right?

[01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:31.240]
But we just weaned a few of these very important calls

[01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:33.040]
Although I don't want to put any more names on this list

[01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:37.980]
We got almost 1200 votes already, that indicates to me we got more than enough idiots on there for you to hate

[01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:40.440]
We don't need any more hate targets right?

[01:24:40.940 --> 01:24:42.540]
God, I got one no for you

[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:45.320]
No I am serious, Jim Brown

[01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:49.780]
White feeding, girlfriend beating, even as grub maybe with the greatest football player to ever live

[01:24:49.780 --> 01:24:52.780]
Certainly one of the top 10 Jim Brown Cleveland Browns

[01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:53.640]
He's four judges time

[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:55.080]
You sure know Jim Brown though right?

[01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:55.840]
For movies

[01:24:55.840 --> 01:25:00.060]
Yeah, well it wasn't movies, he was in all of them disaster movies with OJ like Earthquake

[01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:01.000]
But what was he in?

[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:02.280]
I don't know, he did a bunch

[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:03.180]
But those right?

[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:03.620]
Right

[01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:06.560]
Bad, bad actor and bad, bad with the women man

[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:07.900]
He had a few women problems

[01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:09.300]
Jim Brown, get him on there

[01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:12.080]
Great, great football, maybe my favorite football player of all time

[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:13.040]
Those were the days man

[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:15.620]
Those were the days, next time Brady of course

[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:17.380]
WQAM, hello

Yes sir, here's our cluster of calls for this hour, yes

[01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:35.880]
Okay

[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:36.980]
Can I pull one on the phone?

[01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:39.640]
No, okay, that's our cluster of calls for this hour

[01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:40.900]
That's my new format

[01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:41.920]
Tom's there

[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:43.160]
No, I'm serious

[01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:45.140]
I'll give it a shot now and it's different

[01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:48.800]
Anybody with something to say and you know it doesn't, as you know it doesn't take that many

[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:50.040]
To find out if there is or not

[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:51.780]
Well, you're on sand

[01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:54.120]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:55.300]
That's like pebbin' for boys

[01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:58.000]
Like that, and they're not so I'm moving right along

[01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:59.900]
Bub, blue, bubble, bubble, bubble

[01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:00.940]
And I do it right, come on

[01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:02.740]
You're sitting a bad example

[01:26:04.300 --> 01:26:05.000]
That's better

[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.560]
Now we can do it

[01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:09.460]
Listen, I thought we could play that four hours a day

[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:12.540]
You get a 15-share

[01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:14.060]
Let's try the next rating boy

[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:15.100]

[01:26:17.980 --> 01:26:21.780]
Bub, blue, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble

And everybody is telling me to do that

[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:26.020]
They are

[01:26:26.020 --> 01:26:28.440]
You can do that and you got nothing else going on

[01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:31.240]
Bub, blue, bubble, bubble, right

[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:32.880]
I think it's an end format

[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:34.760]
We can package it and sell it

[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:36.040]
So to cheap channel

[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:39.400]
They'll have like 75 bubble stations on the air before you know it

[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:41.420]
It's a new radio format

[01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:42.880]
Bob Bluth for 2006.

[01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:44.660]
They all not.

[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:46.120]
Beats the crap they're putting on here.

[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:49.360]
11.56, we got Mad Dog after the ballgame,

[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:51.280]

[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:53.060]
because Mad Dog would like to have your accompany.

[01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:55.360]
And then, of course, let him our test 7-10, that speaks for itself.

[01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:57.060]
How'd you like to follow that, Curtis?

[01:26:57.220 --> 01:26:59.760]
Even said, well, you will, like old fingers 10 o'clock to do for Eddie Kay.

[01:27:00.220 --> 01:27:00.660]
Poor Curtis.

[01:27:01.060 --> 01:27:01.920]
Why'd he give him an eyeball?

[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:03.140]
You know, at least he's on the air anyway.

[01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:05.240]
They don't like him because he's not an old Jew.

[01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:07.320]
You know, being outdoors a lot in South Florida

[01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:08.580]
really needs comfortable shoes.

[01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:10.640]
The only place you ought to be thinking and dragging your feet

[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:12.780]
is Brandy Shoes in Pompano Beach.

[01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:14.640]
Brandy's carries major brands like Floreshime,

[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:17.140]
Echo, Mephisto, Rockport, Harsport,

[01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:19.080]
New Balance, and Tons of other name, brand shoes,

[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:20.740]
in all sizes for men and women.

[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:22.960]
And they even carry wide wits and hard to find sizes

[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:23.920]
if you got like funky feet.

[01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:26.460]
Brandy Shoes is the largest independent shoe retailer

[01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:27.400]

[01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:29.300]
And when you go there and you see the selection value

[01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:32.200]
you get at Brandy's, you'll see what I've been raven about them for years.

[01:27:32.660 --> 01:27:33.740]
Go see my good friend Arnie.

[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:35.120]
He'll make sure you get the right fitting shoes

[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:36.460]
at the right price every time.

[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.520]
Brandy's isn't like those department stores

[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:40.380]
where you wander around waiting desperately

[01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:42.980]
to get service, then they tell you after all of that time,

[01:27:43.260 --> 01:27:45.040]
oh you like that style, we don't have it in your size.

[01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:46.960]
The only thing they do at Brandy's is shoes,

[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:48.140]
so they know it inside and out.

[01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:50.980]
You never have to worry about size, selection, or service, or price.

[01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:53.200]
Brandy Shoes will find them at 12.90,

[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:56.080]

[01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:13.300]
or do it on their website at Brandy's Shoes.com.

[01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:15.720]
This is Neil Rogers.

[01:28:16.780 --> 01:28:20.200]
This is 5.69 A.M.

[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:25.800]
This is Mark Morgan, it's the 12 to 1 hour on Q8M.

[01:28:56.500 --> 01:29:00.980]
So what's too crazy about the IRS man?

[01:29:04.580 --> 01:29:07.880]
Not good, that's bad.

[01:29:08.380 --> 01:29:11.020]
The cheating laughing when you think of him.

[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:15.240]
It's not not like you have names.

[01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:18.920]
They're at the door door, let the party heard me.

[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:22.900]
They come running different classes, you can't.

[01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:26.600]
No one's too crazy about the IRS man.

[01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:29.620]
So I'm going to put it 5.60, that way the Q8M is a short hour.

[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:32.240]
We got 48 minutes to go, get that timer clicking, baby.

[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:33.840]
Get it clicking, click on it.

[01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:35.520]
Because we got the pre-game show at 12.50.

[01:29:35.900 --> 01:29:39.140]
Marlins in the message 105 from Jupiter, they're out of this world.

[01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:40.160]
How about those panthers?

[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:43.040]
Oh, that was something I just think, did you get one call about

[01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:44.800]
the panthers this morning, not a one?

[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:47.520]
I mean, I understand this is very little interest,

[01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:48.500]
but they won 60 in a row.

[01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:50.840]
They actually got a shot at a playoff, so it's like a miracle.

[01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:54.140]
A month ago, people would like to laugh you off the street.

[01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:58.080]
Not one, Hank says, oh, they care about the heat.

[01:29:58.780 --> 01:30:00.700]
Oh, Dion Sanders, excellent choice.

[01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:02.320]
That is a fabulous choice.

[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:03.180]
Do you think?

[01:30:03.460 --> 01:30:05.100]
I got that one, Dion, so I can't play.

[01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:05.860]
Right?

[01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:07.380]
We got the one that you can't play.

[01:30:07.420 --> 01:30:08.060]
Must be the money.

[01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:12.120]
Oh, yeah, he gives me the shiflkeys.

[01:30:12.580 --> 01:30:14.720]
Oh, Dion Sanders, talk about it.

[01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:15.880]
It's tough out there for a pimpt.

[01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:19.680]
He got the money of an athlete and the address is like a pimpt.

[01:30:20.020 --> 01:30:21.020]
Boy, he is something.

[01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:22.500]
Dion Sanders, got that neon, Dion?

[01:30:22.940 --> 01:30:23.120]
Yeah.

[01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:23.660]
Good.

[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:24.900]
Now, how's Dad doing?

[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:25.700]
Did she get my F thing?

[01:30:25.860 --> 01:30:26.220]
Yes, she did.

[01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:26.740]
Good.

[01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:29.560]
Okay, just double-checking, because I don't want it to rush off to lunch

[01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:30.320]
and then fight out tomorrow.

[01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:31.300]
Oh, guess what?

[01:30:31.420 --> 01:30:33.120]
I think God jammed into the machine, man.

[01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:34.340]
And they never got it.

[01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:35.300]
Yeah, right.

[01:30:35.620 --> 01:30:36.660]
I always got some story.

[01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:38.040]
And how come they want that today?

[01:30:38.180 --> 01:30:40.180]
They's only the 28th of March last time I checked.

[01:30:40.540 --> 01:30:42.180]
We got three days left in the month after this.

[01:30:42.220 --> 01:30:43.440]
Or do we all get the rest of the week off?

[01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:45.540]
I'll tell you what, in the way this place is going,

[01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:47.240]
we all ought to take the rest of the week off.

[01:30:47.300 --> 01:30:48.240]
What difference is it going to make?

[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:49.480]
Boy, you talk about floating.

[01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:50.500]
My God.

[01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:52.040]
They knew Ray Jean we got here.

[01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:53.040]
They just floating their way through.

[01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:55.180]
And did you ever see Troy Stradford today?

[01:30:56.080 --> 01:30:56.460]
Thinking.

[01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:58.500]
Yeah, did you ever see Chris Jones?

[01:30:58.980 --> 01:31:01.580]
Did we ever get like a follow-up on a conversation from last Friday?

[01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:04.560]
And here's one of the really good you split in your size laughing.

[01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:07.200]
How long before you think we get those client feedback sheets?

[01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:08.380]
Oh, my God.

[01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:09.520]
What a sense of humor this face.

[01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:10.620]
Still hasn't lost it, God.

[01:31:11.020 --> 01:31:12.100]
He's a hundred years old.

[01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:15.780]
And he's still got it.

[01:31:16.100 --> 01:31:16.560]
Just kidding.

This is 5.62-A-MATTRES.

[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:21.480]
The Unlittle Curry Newers, the Neel Rogers.

[01:39:26.380 --> 01:39:27.600]
Oh, yeah.

[01:39:29.860 --> 01:39:30.000]
Oh, yeah.

[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:34.460]
This got head up on.

[01:39:35.740 --> 01:39:39.940]
And took a hit in Woody, act like Cheech and Chong.

[01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:45.500]
And get some munchies and make roundly stills with hats.

[01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:50.880]
And Woody's share it with Jesus and the saints.

[01:39:51.420 --> 01:39:53.580]
Those highest hotheads.

[01:39:54.140 --> 01:39:55.960]
And yeah, yeah.

[01:39:56.760 --> 01:40:01.320]
Hot is grace and yeah, yeah.

[01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:06.540]
Hot is good and yeah, yeah.

[01:40:06.540 --> 01:40:09.260]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[01:40:09.420 --> 01:40:12.360]
Hot is God's most cannabis.

[01:40:14.740 --> 01:40:18.880]
Logan's heart's like one of us.

[01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:23.460]
Get in high on the back of the bar.

[01:40:23.980 --> 01:40:29.000]
You're feeling loads of spitting soar.

[01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:32.140]
All the greyhound must do roll.

[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:33.820]
Oh, my God.

[01:40:33.820 --> 01:40:37.180]
Look at some bad looking old roll.

[01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:43.820]
So shall I pull down back to take home?

[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.860]
No good fate for Marley on his throne.

[01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:58.620]
No fun in heaven, let's go.

[01:40:59.520 --> 01:40:59.800]
Look at that.

[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:01.040]
We got 240 votes.

[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:04.140]
I think 1240 was WGBA in Geneva, New York, I do believe.

[01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:05.860]
I never worked there, but young Neil did.

[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:07.740]
I think I did like that.

[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:10.000]
And yes, we don't have any.

[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.200]
Jim Brown, Larry, Bird and Charles Berkeley don't have any.

[01:41:12.420 --> 01:41:13.540]
Oh, how fast they forget.

[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:14.560]
What's the end of that?

[01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:17.860]
The only on the on's got, uh, what was he?

[01:41:17.980 --> 01:41:19.080]
We can put him on here.

[01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:21.460]
Sure, we always got three already.

[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:24.020]
We realize how fast he's moving on up.

[01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:25.500]
So to put him on there a long time ago.

[01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:26.780]
Nice suit by the way, Dion.

[01:41:27.260 --> 01:41:28.200]
Rod Roddy would be proud.

[01:41:28.580 --> 01:41:29.580]
Now you talk about a nerd.

[01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:32.120]
There is a kid with also the name of Skylar Bartels.

[01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:33.940]
He's from Harvard, Nebraska.

[01:41:34.940 --> 01:41:38.720]
Oh, anyway, and I was just telling you about seeing Dress Decre last night with Angie Dickinson.

[01:41:38.900 --> 01:41:40.880]
We know the kid that played her son that was in Christine.

[01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:42.960]
That nerdy looking kid with the goofy glasses.

[01:41:43.460 --> 01:41:43.660]
Yeah.

[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:45.080]
Well, that's what this kid looks like.

[01:41:45.540 --> 01:41:46.660]
Now why is this kid important?

[01:41:46.740 --> 01:41:52.940]
Because he spent his spring break, not at Daytona, not in Cocoa Beach, not in Nolines, uh, at Walmart.

[01:41:53.380 --> 01:41:54.140]
Do you see this story?

[01:41:54.140 --> 01:41:54.720]
No.

[01:41:54.980 --> 01:41:56.980]
I think what he's really trying to tell the world is...

[01:41:56.980 --> 01:41:57.600]
I have no life.

[01:41:58.100 --> 01:42:00.160]
Skylar Bartels kept looking over his shoulder.

[01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:03.460]
It's a habit he picked up living at the Windsor Heights Walmart for three days.

[01:42:03.940 --> 01:42:08.440]
Living there, eating, sleeping, checking out the DVDs, never leaving.

[01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:11.620]
The plan was to spend his entire spring break there under the radar.

[01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:13.260]
Some kids go to Cancun.

[01:42:13.700 --> 01:42:20.280]
Skylar Bartels, a Drake University sophomore from Harvard, Nebraska, and looking every bit of it, went to the Garden and patio department.

[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:27.800]
The real experiment had been over for a few days, but Bartels was still in great experiment mode, as we sat in the booth in the subway sandwich shop through the front of the store.

[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:28.260]
Haha.

[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:29.000]
Oh, oh.

[01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:31.280]
He glances at the friendly white-haired Walmart greeters.

[01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:32.880]
Were they onto him?

[01:42:33.020 --> 01:42:33.600]
Were they staring?

[01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:36.160]
Bartels were still suffering from greeter phobia.

[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:38.520]
He was never out to get Walmart, he explained.

[01:42:38.660 --> 01:42:39.800]
This wasn't supposed to be an expose.

[01:42:40.260 --> 01:42:45.620]
He didn't burst through the door, stewing about low wages for working conditions, or the way the big chain chews up mom and pop stories.

[01:42:45.620 --> 01:42:50.460]
This was part sociology experiment, part school project, part professional neurod I think.

[01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:51.940]
Bartels is a writing major.

[01:42:52.260 --> 01:42:56.400]
Maybe he put it all down on paper and pick up an independent study quitted, or even sell it to somebody someday.

[01:42:56.760 --> 01:43:01.060]
Maybe he moved to another Walmart and produced a documentary, like the guy who weighed nothing but McDonald's for a month.

[01:43:01.220 --> 01:43:01.520]
They did it.

[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:03.520]
Bartels got the idea from a commercial.

[01:43:03.900 --> 01:43:07.700]
Was it true that those happy, shiny people were telling him, always low prices?

[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:08.280]
Always?

[01:43:08.820 --> 01:43:12.020]
Could the biggest, most successful discount store in the world really meet his every need?

[01:43:12.340 --> 01:43:13.200]
24 hours a day?

[01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:14.880]
That's what the TV spots were telling him.

[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:17.420]
That was the goal, he said, to buy everything I needed at Walmart.

[01:43:17.980 --> 01:43:20.180]
There's a picture of him with sister Mary Sue a nun.

[01:43:20.780 --> 01:43:22.140]
And you know something hard to tell him apart.

[01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:25.360]
His father told him to go for it, offered to bankroll the project.

[01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:28.800]
On Sunday his girlfriend dropped him off at the front door and drove away.

[01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:29.580]
The game was on.

[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:31.480]
He didn't tell Walmart what he was doing.

[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:32.360]
It's probably a good thing.

[01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:34.980]
We weren't aware of this, so corporate spokesperson, when she earned a webber.

[01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:36.300]
But it's not something we condone.

[01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:37.760]
We're a retailer, not a hotel.

[01:43:39.220 --> 01:43:39.580]
Really?

[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:40.980]
You know something?

[01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:42.000]
Probably give him an idea.

[01:43:42.260 --> 01:43:42.860]
Walmart hotel.

[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:43.100]
Yeah.

[01:43:43.100 --> 01:43:44.100]
That was a good idea.

[01:43:44.260 --> 01:43:45.860]
I think everybody could go crash at Walmart.

[01:43:46.260 --> 01:43:52.160]
A great law professor gave Martel some advice to store his private property if they ask you to leave, go quickly and quietly.

[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:55.260]
Martel's walked into the big box wearing jeans and white t-shirt.

[01:43:55.640 --> 01:44:00.780]
He had a cell phone in case of emergency, his heart medicine, his bank card, two forms of ID and nothing else.

[01:44:01.100 --> 01:44:04.540]
He spent the first afternoon watching chicken little, the animated Disney film.

[01:44:04.780 --> 01:44:05.420]
He watched it all.

[01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:06.680]
The deleted scenes interview is out.

[01:44:06.740 --> 01:44:07.320]
It takes everything.

[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:09.420]
They headed on a continuous loop the whole time.

[01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:09.840]
I was there.

[01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:12.800]
He said, I passed through the department and said, oh, it's about halfway through.

[01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:13.480]
I like this part.

[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:14.400]
I think I'll watch it again.

[01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:15.620]
Oh, brother.

[01:44:15.820 --> 01:44:16.500]
I have no life.

[01:44:16.820 --> 01:44:19.200]
Martel's decided not to buy anything he couldn't carry around the store.

[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:26.960]
He ended up with a jacket for storage space, a notepad, some pencils, an electronic voice recorder, a free pack of underwear, a coma toothbrush, and some toothpaste.

[01:44:27.620 --> 01:44:30.560]
He lived off energy drinks, donuts, yogurt, and subway sandwiches.

[01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:33.100]
He figured he slept four hours at the 41 in captivity.

[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:39.820]
He caught a few minutes whenever he could, and a subway booth or restroom stall, which isn't recommended, especially with the night stockers bursting in every five minutes.

[01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:41.240]
Night stockers.

[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:41.900]
Remember that show?

[01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:42.760]
It's a duke.

[01:44:42.980 --> 01:44:46.620]
I got to the point he said where I was indebted falling asleep on the toilet seat, which sounds kind of weird.

[01:44:46.900 --> 01:44:48.820]
Oh, maybe that's what happened in yesterday, the U.

[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:50.860]
Maybe the sales holes fell asleep on the seat.

[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:51.620]
They're sleeping at the switch.

[01:44:51.620 --> 01:44:52.720]
Maybe they're asleep on the seat.

[01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:54.080]
Well, I beat them to it this time.

[01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:55.080]
Well, thank god.

[01:44:55.180 --> 01:44:56.200]
You're learning your lesson, man.

[01:44:56.420 --> 01:44:57.820]
Get in there early, early and often.

[01:44:58.340 --> 01:45:01.200]
The best place for dosing was lawn and garden where the lights weren't so bright.

[01:45:01.540 --> 01:45:03.280]
Nobody worked there between two and four in the morning.

[01:45:03.660 --> 01:45:06.360]
Martel's found a lawn chair kicked back and wondered how life could be better.

[01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:10.460]
Life would be perfectly discovered without the worker who showed up before dawn to stock plants.

[01:45:10.820 --> 01:45:13.440]
Martel's hopped up and pretended to be looking for home patio furniture.

[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:15.880]
That wonderful A&M shift was at 80 low points.

[01:45:16.020 --> 01:45:16.780]
Someway was closed.

[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:21.740]
Martel's was off in the only Walmart shopper, which made it harder to blend into cosmetics and sporting goods.

[01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:24.080]
Oh, and it goes on and on.

[01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:29.720]
He was sitting on a floor reading a magazine at 3 a.m. when a man shooting from the cold walked in, bought an atlas and left.

[01:45:30.060 --> 01:45:33.760]
You'd see a lot of people reading to Martel said, Cosmopolitan was a huge favorite.

[01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:37.840]
But nobody ever checked the magazine section and never saw anybody stalking books or magazines.

[01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:42.560]
He found it strange the way the same two guys kept showing up in the middle of the night to buy movies.

[01:45:42.780 --> 01:45:44.600]
They looked like the devil's reject kind of guys.

[01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:47.720]
He said, but they ended up buying stuff like Charlie and the chocolate factory.

[01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:48.480]
Uh-huh.

[01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:52.000]
Like I said, the message is...

[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:52.600]
I have no idea.

[01:45:52.660 --> 01:45:54.020]
And I'm going to be able to relate to that.

[01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:54.820]
Believe you me.

[01:45:54.900 --> 01:45:56.940]
We've talked to many of you and there is no doubt.

[01:45:57.880 --> 01:46:00.600]
5.6.7.1. I'm not giving the phone number out. I got no time for any call.

[01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:02.360]
Do I? Well, I got a call.

[01:46:02.700 --> 01:46:03.500]
WDQ-A-M, hello.

[01:46:04.420 --> 01:46:09.320]
See, and that's because there's no third break this hour, which there would be if we had any spots or if anybody knew how to do the log.

[01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:13.380]
Or if the sales department was like on top of these things, there's more money. This hour is evidence.

[01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:17.080]
Okay. Make a copy of this log. We'll produce it as evidence in court.

[01:46:17.700 --> 01:46:19.760]
Peeing it away. WDQ-A-M, hello.

[01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:24.180]
Maybe they wouldn't have to borrow money to buy the radio stations if they weren't peeing all the money away down the toilet.

[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:25.840]
WDQ-A-M, hello.

[01:46:26.220 --> 01:46:26.880]
Hey, me, how may I do it?

[01:46:27.140 --> 01:46:27.400]
Okay.

[01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:31.700]
I do have one good thing. Actually, I mean, I know I always take the beesleafs and everything like that.

[01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:34.160]
But they actually just open smart over here on the West Coast.

[01:46:34.460 --> 01:46:38.520]
You heard they got rid of that idiot Liz Wilde. They fired her ass again.

[01:46:38.980 --> 01:46:39.560]
Yeah, big news.

[01:46:39.940 --> 01:46:43.760]
Yeah, well, that's good news. That's good news. Maybe they'll actually get... maybe they'll put you on over here now.

[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:44.380]
Yeah, right.

[01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:45.380]
Yeah, okay.

[01:46:45.540 --> 01:46:46.260]
Give it.

[01:46:46.580 --> 01:46:48.180]
Top of a couple more of those, whatever you're taking.

[01:46:48.700 --> 01:46:48.960]
Wow.

[01:46:49.340 --> 01:46:50.860]
5.6.7.0.5.60.

[01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:55.500]
They've arrived in Singular, wireless lines. What's upon the time we were on over there?

[01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:57.060]
Remember those glorious days in Fort Myers?

[01:46:57.180 --> 01:46:57.700]
Oh, yeah.

[01:46:57.700 --> 01:46:58.680]
The salad days.

[01:46:58.860 --> 01:47:00.840]
Woo! We did. We have an audience over there?

[01:47:01.020 --> 01:47:01.160]
No.

[01:47:01.260 --> 01:47:04.580]
Or what? My God. We were kicking big fat smelly ass.

[01:47:05.780 --> 01:47:06.780]
WDQ-A-M, hello.

[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:07.280]
Money.

[01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:08.920]
WDQ-A-M, hello.

[01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:09.840]
Who's Q-A-M?

[01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:10.560]
Hello.

[01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:11.580]
Hello.

[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:12.600]
Yeah, hello.

[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:13.200]
Yes.

[01:47:13.780 --> 01:47:16.580]
I, in the middle of the street, go...

[01:47:16.580 --> 01:47:17.920]
WDQ-A-M, hello.

[01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:20.340]
I made number one. That's unbelievable.

[01:47:21.420 --> 01:47:22.320]
WDQ-A-M, hello.

[01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:23.520]
Hey, Neil.

[01:47:24.020 --> 01:47:24.320]
Yes, sir.

[01:47:24.900 --> 01:47:30.480]
Hey, does Q-A-M get a massive power surge when they put a Marla's game on and everyone turns the radio off?

[01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:34.140]
Yeah. Yeah, we've been able to run energy there. We've cut down our FP and O bill.

[01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:34.980]
Excellent.

[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:35.880]
Thank you.

[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:37.100]
Okay. No problem.

[01:47:37.580 --> 01:47:40.340]
Hey, how about those Hurricane basketball games we had a couple weeks ago?

[01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:43.000]
Those are really big ratings, they're killer. I mean, they're grabbers.

[01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:44.060]
They were grabbing it.

[01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:44.820]
Couldn't you hear them?

[01:47:44.820 --> 01:47:45.540]
I heard them.

[01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:46.640]
They're from the Tourland Tourland Seed.

[01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:47.260]
Wow.

[01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:50.360]
Gwen, Mikkelson writes in the center, you're right, no more causes. Sorry.

[01:47:50.380 --> 01:47:51.060]
I told you I didn't have time.

[01:47:51.140 --> 01:47:52.040]
And you're like, oh, yeah, you're good.

[01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:52.640]
No, I don't.

[01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:53.120]
I don't have time.

[01:47:53.340 --> 01:47:56.500]
We only got 25 minutes, Mr. Plus, we got a lot of exit music, man.

[01:47:57.240 --> 01:47:59.200]
Yeah, that's certainly the volume of the time.

[01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:00.020]
Not bad.

[01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:00.980]
Yeah, yeah.

[01:48:01.620 --> 01:48:02.700]
It's the funs, brothers.

[01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:06.400]
Roll band, right?

[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:14.480]
Nice.

[01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:17.640]
I can put that like I could loop it, you know, and play that for like 25 minutes.

[01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:18.800]
It's a possibility.

[01:48:19.180 --> 01:48:22.880]
All we could alternate it, we could loop that, and then we could like, express it with...

[01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:34.720]
I'm thinking that's a format.

[01:48:34.980 --> 01:48:35.540]
I don't know about you.

[01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:40.100]
No, I'm thinking we break that down and sample it and make a song out of it.

[01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:40.580]
Yeah.

[01:48:41.100 --> 01:48:42.880]
Just as long as we put on endless loop.

[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:43.200]
Right.

[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:46.520]
Something for you to think about since you want to play a lot of music this summer when

[01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:47.440]
you shut the phone off.

[01:48:47.860 --> 01:48:50.100]
The American people share the blame for the war in Iraq.

[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:53.680]
That was one of the messages during the Iraqi women speak out to an anti-war event that

[01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:56.840]
drew hundreds of attendees to the veterans memorial building in Santa Cruz.

[01:48:57.380 --> 01:49:00.260]
When you look at the lead up to the war in Iraq, I blame President Bush.

[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:00.960]
I blame Congress.

[01:49:01.140 --> 01:49:04.860]
I blame the media, said Scott Ritter, former Marine, former UN Chief weapons inspector for

[01:49:04.860 --> 01:49:09.360]
Iraq, and contributed to the book Neocon again, a compilation of condemnations of the Iraq

[01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:09.660]
war.

[01:49:09.940 --> 01:49:12.400]
But I'm not cutting any slack for the American people, he said.

[01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:14.460]
Americans, he said, have grown accustomed to lifestyle.

[01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:15.400]
They cannot sustain.

[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:19.600]
Many Americans have failed to engage, he said, making the American government more of an

[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:21.360]
oligarchy than a representative democracy.

[01:49:21.740 --> 01:49:22.760]
As a nation, we are mute.

[01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:24.060]
We are silent, Ritter-funded.

[01:49:24.300 --> 01:49:26.380]
And he is absolutely correct, sir.

[01:49:26.580 --> 01:49:30.200]
The event was part of a tour organized by San Francisco International Human Rights Organization

[01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:34.160]
Global Exchange that sent a Iraqi women to speaking engagements across the country,

[01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:36.860]
talk about their experiences and the U.S. invasion.

[01:49:36.860 --> 01:49:42.380]
But the Iraqi women scheduled to speak and be sent to Cruz event, Faiz al-Arajee, couldn't

[01:49:42.380 --> 01:49:43.560]
make it because of exhaustion.

[01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:47.580]
For a Iraqi women are participating in the project, speaking at events colleges, houses

[01:49:47.580 --> 01:49:51.040]
of worship and other places, giving local newspaper interviews and speaking on radio

[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:51.840]
shows.

[01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:55.800]
Al-Arajee said Benjamin has been mostly centered, and initially conservative parts of the

[01:49:55.800 --> 01:49:56.100]
country.

[01:49:56.400 --> 01:49:59.500]
We found that people are hungry for information no matter where they are, said Benjamin.

[01:49:59.980 --> 01:50:03.660]
Al-Arajee said Benjamin maintains that Iraqis are capable of stopping civil war if the

[01:50:03.660 --> 01:50:04.660]
U.S. troops would just leave.

[01:50:04.660 --> 01:50:08.480]
Others say they may hope that their children will come home alive from school each day.

[01:50:08.820 --> 01:50:12.160]
Such information was one of the things that Jay Johnson and Santa Cruz came to hear.

[01:50:12.460 --> 01:50:14.840]
I am interested in the war when I learned more information I can get about it.

[01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:18.820]
He said especially the women's issues, that search for information also drew Dina Scopat,

[01:50:18.820 --> 01:50:20.260]
a Scopatoni of Aptos.

[01:50:20.840 --> 01:50:23.660]
I am waiting to find out the truth, I guess, or a little bit more of a Chibi San.

[01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:27.720]
Also speaking at the event was Reyna Governe, a former U.S. Army captain who put a lot of

[01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:30.600]
his articles on our website, Reyna Governe, and a former CIA analyst.

[01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:34.240]
We have a detailed, not present, Bush-eyed, stepped-led Geneva conventions leading to

[01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:36.220]
our publicly acknowledged policy of torturing people.

[01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:39.640]
We have all heard it was a couple of bad apples at the bottom, but I have documentation

[01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:42.960]
that it was bad apples at the top of the barrel, said the government, producing a memorandum

[01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:47.140]
signed by President Bush that required that the detainees be treated humanely and to

[01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:50.360]
the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity in a matter of consistent

[01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:51.520]
with the principles of Geneva.

[01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:54.000]
That is a loophole you can grab a MAC truck through, we have a set.

[01:50:54.380 --> 01:50:57.620]
To extend appropriate and consistent with military necessity, my ass.

[01:50:57.620 --> 01:51:02.060]
The organizers urged attendees to act by sending a postcard representative Sam Far,

[01:51:02.300 --> 01:51:06.660]
Democrat of Carmel, urging him to cut off funds for the war by sending Massachusetts representative

[01:51:06.660 --> 01:51:09.440]
James Pima Governe's and the War and Iraq Act of 2005.

[01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:10.580]
You going to sign it?

[01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:11.460]
You sign it?

[01:51:11.740 --> 01:51:12.460]
We have a portrait.

[01:51:12.700 --> 01:51:14.660]
You're asked so fast, even Lou Dobzoy applauding.

[01:51:14.880 --> 01:51:16.580]
Between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada.

[01:51:16.700 --> 01:51:17.340]
Oh, God.

[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:19.140]
I mean, talk about a one-note show.

[01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:22.120]
He had granted two or three weeks, all of a sudden he got religion, he became very

[01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:26.600]
elucid, he was on target and the thing with the apports and Dubai and Dubi Dubi Dubi

[01:51:26.600 --> 01:51:27.980]
and now he's right back to where he was there.

[01:51:28.040 --> 01:51:28.740]
Just obsessed.

[01:51:29.400 --> 01:51:33.380]
Not that he's not right, but I mean, Jesus, kind of like a Emmy shaper.

[01:51:33.540 --> 01:51:34.040]
It was Cuban.

[01:51:34.340 --> 01:51:34.920]
It was Cuban.

[01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:36.020]
Oh, that whole deal again.

[01:51:36.340 --> 01:51:37.220]
Oh, God.

[01:51:37.460 --> 01:51:38.080]
Give me a break.

[01:51:38.580 --> 01:51:40.760]
They're not so magnificent obsession, but anyway, he's your guy.

[01:51:40.860 --> 01:51:41.460]
You know, Lou Dobz.

[01:51:41.820 --> 01:51:42.580]
Okay, big fan.

[01:51:42.980 --> 01:51:45.280]
I'll take what's his name, I'll take Doug Thompson.

[01:51:45.500 --> 01:51:46.220]
You have Lou Dobz.

[01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:48.200]
As far as my media hero.

[01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:48.860]
Okay.

[01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:49.620]
Is that okay?

[01:51:49.940 --> 01:51:52.520]
Well, until Doug Thompson gets a TV show, when does that start?

[01:51:53.120 --> 01:51:56.600]
1200 and it starts when they find some network that would put him on, which ain't any of the

[01:51:56.600 --> 01:51:58.260]
big three or the talking hit one.

[01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:00.200]
I'll tell you one thing, he's right in the arena of Reda Cosby.

[01:52:00.700 --> 01:52:04.900]
You know, if MSNBC wonders why nobody watches their network, take a look at who they got

[01:52:04.900 --> 01:52:05.120]
on.

[01:52:05.180 --> 01:52:08.980]
Other than what's his name, Keith Oldman, oh, there's a Casper Winnieburger.

[01:52:09.180 --> 01:52:09.500]
1987.

[01:52:09.780 --> 01:52:10.420]
Look at that.

[01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:12.720]
That was 99 and he looked 100 years old.

[01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:13.200]
He was 88.

[01:52:13.400 --> 01:52:14.260]
That's definitely old enough.

[01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:15.080]
Don't you think?

[01:52:15.540 --> 01:52:15.940]
Got the one.

[01:52:15.940 --> 01:52:16.960]
That's for Winnieburg, who was 88.

[01:52:17.180 --> 01:52:18.160]
That's what I just said, bitch.

[01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:22.500]
Well, that's Mrs. Limbaugh.

[01:52:22.500 --> 01:52:24.840]
You get Brown, Larry Burton, Charles Berkeley, he's still got the big zero.

[01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:26.520]
You don't think she's cute, Darren Kagan?

[01:52:26.660 --> 01:52:28.180]
Just for a moment, forget about that.

[01:52:28.380 --> 01:52:28.760]
Oh, sorry, she's cute.

[01:52:29.380 --> 01:52:29.740]
No.

[01:52:30.540 --> 01:52:30.540]

[01:52:30.920 --> 01:52:31.020]
No.

[01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:33.160]
Josh, you think she's kind of cutesy?

[01:52:33.740 --> 01:52:33.880]
No.

[01:52:35.960 --> 01:52:37.260]
You know you're lying.

[01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:43.100]
If she was married to say like Lou Dobbs, you say she's hotter than a firecracker, how

[01:52:43.100 --> 01:52:44.180]
do they in the face of the sun?

[01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:45.040]
No, I'm good.

[01:52:45.460 --> 01:52:46.820]
No, I'm not talking about you and I'm talking about you.

[01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:50.940]
You don't even know Lou Dobbs from Lou Groza.

[01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:52.160]
Who's the name?

[01:52:52.660 --> 01:52:53.300]
Who's the toe?

[01:52:53.540 --> 01:52:54.380]
Who's the toe, Groza?

[01:52:55.060 --> 01:52:56.820]
Cleveland Brown's great play skicker, baby.

[01:52:57.080 --> 01:52:58.680]
You better start learning your football, Mr.

[01:52:58.780 --> 01:53:02.060]
if you're going to be a professional jockmeister, if you're going to be a part of Clemens's

[01:53:02.060 --> 01:53:02.700]
triumvirate.

[01:53:03.220 --> 01:53:06.520]
If you're going to crack that crowd, you're going to crack the crack crowd or what?

[01:53:06.920 --> 01:53:07.560]
I'm working on it.

[01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:12.400]
Yeah, you better start sniffing jockstrap all day 24-7 and then you can get into a

[01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:13.960]
recurrence in the beast and little Robert.

[01:53:14.300 --> 01:53:17.700]
And I got news for her when Robert sniffs a jockstrap and has a different connotation.

[01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:18.420]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:53:18.620 --> 01:53:19.040]
You're fair.

[01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:19.360]
Yeah.

[01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:20.300]
That's what I'm thinking.

[01:53:21.220 --> 01:53:24.120]
1231, we got Marlon's baseball in just 19 minutes.

[01:53:24.120 --> 01:53:26.380]
You'll be able to hear the sound of those radios clicking on.

[01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:27.660]
Is this game on TV, by the way?

[01:53:28.060 --> 01:53:30.300]
They don't put the great-proof league games under.

[01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:30.840]
They do.

[01:53:30.980 --> 01:53:32.240]
They do, I'm like, fuck you up.

[01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:33.380]
But this one I don't think is.

[01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:35.120]
Well, I don't want to think about it.

[01:53:35.220 --> 01:53:35.980]
I want to know it.

[01:53:36.140 --> 01:53:36.380]
Okay?

[01:53:36.660 --> 01:53:39.000]
So I'm going to like check the Sun Sentinel right here.

[01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:40.660]
I would check the hero, but I don't believe them.

[01:53:41.100 --> 01:53:43.600]
All of the Sun Settle that's a TV thing, it might be Tommy Jicke.

[01:53:43.860 --> 01:53:45.300]
Well, I'm sure he's got nothing.

[01:53:45.380 --> 01:53:46.200]
He's got to do with sports.

[01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:47.080]
Sports.

[01:53:47.240 --> 01:53:47.920]
That's out of his league.

[01:53:47.920 --> 01:53:49.840]
Let's see the Florida Marlins.

[01:53:50.680 --> 01:53:53.280]
Are they, how they doing this spring with their little league team?

[01:53:53.820 --> 01:53:55.840]
Well, first place, but, you know, are they really?

[01:53:56.220 --> 01:53:58.000]
Well, yeah, but, you know, spring doesn't mean anything.

[01:53:58.200 --> 01:54:00.400]
Oh, they got a guy named Abercrombie.

[01:54:00.720 --> 01:54:01.720]
Reggie, that was a horse.

[01:54:02.180 --> 01:54:03.060]
Reggie Abercrombie.

[01:54:03.220 --> 01:54:04.820]
He went over two against the Urels on Monday.

[01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:08.640]
Drops his grave-foot league average 14 points, but he's still hitting 382.

[01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:10.200]
He's kicking fat ass, baby.

[01:54:10.660 --> 01:54:10.980]
Wow.

[01:54:11.860 --> 01:54:12.220]
382.

[01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:12.960]
What's wrong with that?

[01:54:13.340 --> 01:54:16.820]
So where's the thing on here about the schedule, about who's on first and when the game

[01:54:16.820 --> 01:54:17.900]
and you know, there's no way.

[01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:19.940]
This, this website really blows, man.

[01:54:20.300 --> 01:54:21.140]
This is so bad.

[01:54:21.580 --> 01:54:23.580]
Wouldn't it be nice to know if this game was on TV or something?

[01:54:23.980 --> 01:54:27.880]
Let's see, Marlins, where's the sports on TV thing?

[01:54:28.220 --> 01:54:28.740]
Where's something?

[01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:30.080]
What are these papers, blow?

[01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:33.460]
28 to 1, a QAM, 1250 to Marlins on deck.

[01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:36.540]
It will be playing some of that really great punk brothers music band with...

[01:54:37.100 --> 01:54:38.200]
I see no, Reggie Abercrombie.

[01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:39.100]
I see no, Reggie Abercrombie.

[01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:39.500]
I see no, Reggie Abercrombie.

[01:54:39.500 --> 01:54:39.500]

[01:54:39.940 --> 01:54:41.860]
Roll band, I...

[01:54:41.860 --> 01:54:42.740]
Roll band.

[01:54:43.020 --> 01:54:44.440]
I can't say a guy's no more, of course.

[01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:45.720]
Hey, y'all know this name.

[01:54:45.720 --> 01:54:46.800]
We can say dry concepts.

[01:54:46.940 --> 01:54:49.880]
I've been using them in my homes for 21 amazing years now.

[01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:53.180]
They are the best carpet cleaning company in the world before you go out and spend thousands

[01:54:53.180 --> 01:54:54.220]
of you replace your carpets.

[01:54:54.560 --> 01:54:57.560]
Give dry concepts a call because when they get done it looks like they had brand new

[01:54:57.560 --> 01:54:59.020]
lead right on your floor.

[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:00.480]
They'll bring your carpets back to life.

[01:55:00.580 --> 01:55:01.740]
They'll leave them vibrant in color.

[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:04.540]
Soft at the touch, stain free and looking just like brand new.

[01:55:04.900 --> 01:55:06.660]
Dry concepts is the only company I've been using.

[01:55:06.900 --> 01:55:09.540]
21 long, excruciating years in a variety of homes.

[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:12.160]
They were just in my house a couple weeks ago and the only company you ought to trust

[01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:12.480]
too.

[01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:16.160]

[01:55:20.740 --> 01:55:22.040]
leather furniture and lots more.

[01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:25.140]
And without a doubt one of the best things you can do for that Oriental or Area or Magic

[01:55:25.140 --> 01:55:27.700]
Flying Carpet Rug is to use a quality underlayment.

[01:55:27.820 --> 01:55:29.880]
It's essential for extending life and beauty of that area.

[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:33.020]
Rug and provides critical cushioning and prevents getting on hard floors too.

[01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:37.360]

All of these things, carpet cleaning, water damage restoration, pet odor treatments, mattress

[01:55:49.940 --> 01:55:50.880]
cleaning and lots more.

[01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:52.300]
Call the best and trust the best.

[01:55:52.540 --> 01:55:53.640]
Dry concepts like I do.

[01:55:53.820 --> 01:55:55.780]
Indeed, right under the palm beaches, it's a toll free call.

[01:55:56.260 --> 01:55:58.560]
1-800-248-5071.

[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:03.900]
That's 1-800-248-5071 around the web, dryconcepts.com.

[01:56:03.900 --> 01:56:06.340]
This is Neil Rogers.

[01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:11.020]
This is 5.62-8-10.

[01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:12.940]
And, kid, God.

[01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:20.620]
If anybody has a opinion, you fell dissenting from our way.

[01:56:22.060 --> 01:56:25.340]
We'll place your name into the sea, stop.

[01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:28.300]
I've had a meh of the stage.

[01:56:29.480 --> 01:56:32.900]
Don't even have a hook, where's God?

[01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:35.520]
Just follow, don't say.

[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.420]
Everybody's standing by here.

[01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:42.780]
That's a USA.

[01:56:45.220 --> 01:56:50.620]
In the act of victory in love, you're watching all of you.

[01:56:52.820 --> 01:56:55.140]
Everyone does a prescription.

[01:56:55.140 --> 01:56:59.220]
So what would you do?

[01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:02.700]
This is a restoration.

[01:57:03.900 --> 01:57:05.480]
And all you might lose.

[01:57:07.620 --> 01:57:13.060]
In bush other landation, that's a USA.

[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:17.220]
You gotta hate those two.

[01:57:18.780 --> 01:57:20.960]
And sentence them all those two.

[01:57:22.740 --> 01:57:26.440]
Believe everything we tell you.

[01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:28.360]
Understand, run, you.

[01:57:30.620 --> 01:57:33.320]
Blood war for corporate.

[01:57:34.260 --> 01:57:36.380]
Build up your escalator.

[01:57:38.060 --> 01:57:40.420]
A roof and chainy bush venue.

[01:57:41.780 --> 01:57:43.220]
That's a USA.

[01:57:45.180 --> 01:57:48.500]
Oh, we don't mind to see our jobs grow.

[01:57:48.500 --> 01:57:51.440]
A brother's time of his war.

[01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:55.300]
We're fascinated by jail.

[01:57:56.920 --> 01:57:58.820]
Don't be so stupid, war.

[01:58:00.260 --> 01:58:03.080]
All the hour is crazy.

[01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:06.240]
The facts are parroted with.

[01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:10.180]
Everybody's turning back.

[01:58:11.800 --> 01:58:13.220]
That's a USA.

[01:58:13.220 --> 01:58:13.680]
USA.

[01:58:15.800 --> 01:58:20.140]
I'm a crazy.

[01:58:21.580 --> 01:58:22.720]
I'm a crazy.

[01:58:23.460 --> 01:58:25.520]
I'm a crazy.

[01:58:25.520 --> 01:58:26.840]
I'm a crazy.

[01:58:29.180 --> 01:58:32.320]
I'm a crazy.

[01:58:38.020 --> 01:58:50.680]
I'm a crazy.

[01:58:52.800 --> 01:58:55.080]
I'm a crazy.

[01:58:56.460 --> 01:58:58.860]
I'm a crazy.

[01:58:58.860 --> 01:59:02.300]
I'm a crazy.

[01:59:13.960 --> 01:59:21.800]
I'm a little bit more

[01:59:21.800 --> 01:59:23.240]
I'm a little bit more

[01:59:23.240 --> 01:59:23.520]
I'm a little bit more

[01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:24.720]
I'm a little bit more

[01:59:28.560 --> 01:59:31.680]
I'm a little bit more

[01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:31.700]
I'm a little bit more

[01:59:31.700 --> 01:59:31.740]
I'm a little bit more

[01:59:31.740 --> 01:59:32.160]
I'm a little bit more

[01:59:32.160 --> 01:59:32.160]

[01:59:32.160 --> 01:59:32.160]

[01:59:32.160 --> 01:59:32.160]

[01:59:32.160 --> 01:59:32.160]

[01:59:32.160 --> 01:59:32.160]

[01:59:32.160 --> 01:59:32.240]
I'm a little bit more

[01:59:32.720 --> 01:59:37.460]
I'm a little bit more

[01:59:37.460 --> 01:59:38.260]
I'm a little bit more

[01:59:38.260 --> 01:59:40.420]
I'm a little bit more

[01:59:40.420 --> 01:59:40.840]
I'm a little bit more

[01:59:40.840 --> 01:59:40.840]

[01:59:41.460 --> 01:59:43.000]
Excellent! I said it's number one, two bullets

[01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.520]
That is both between the ears

[01:59:45.520 --> 01:59:47.800]
Okay, I just said it's in there to watch out

[01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:49.040]
A little story for tomorrow

[01:59:49.040 --> 01:59:52.140]
Okay, what all time athletes do just like most of them are full today?

[01:59:52.840 --> 01:59:54.920]
100 E3 votes, that is a shocking number

[01:59:54.920 --> 01:59:55.840]
You know, when you come right down to it

[01:59:55.840 --> 01:59:57.320]
I think that's a little audience, wouldn't you?

[01:59:57.700 --> 01:59:58.060]
Must be!

[01:59:58.060 --> 01:59:58.980]
12 E3

[02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.480]
4J, 437, man, they hate you like poison effect

[02:00:02.480 --> 02:00:05.020]
We probably should have an honor with this play like an OJ or something

[02:00:05.020 --> 02:00:06.520]
We haven't played in a long time

[02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:08.460]
Like maybe, I don't know

[02:00:08.460 --> 02:00:09.360]
We'll come up with one

[02:00:10.060 --> 02:00:11.940]
437, very bonds 191

[02:00:11.940 --> 02:00:14.160]
A very respectable second but a distance second

[02:00:14.160 --> 02:00:14.900]
I'm in the same league

[02:00:14.900 --> 02:00:17.680]
I hate sports 73, my Tyson 60

[02:00:17.680 --> 02:00:18.620]
Oh before I continue

[02:00:18.620 --> 02:00:20.980]
So Georgia had an order of the Dreamfields pasta

[02:00:20.980 --> 02:00:22.120]
Yeah, in line, right?

[02:00:22.460 --> 02:00:23.660]
I did a completely different order

[02:00:23.660 --> 02:00:26.520]
It was because the public's the shelf is empty where it was

[02:00:26.520 --> 02:00:30.340]
Now, have we had since I've been raving about it for two weeks and I love it every day almost

[02:00:30.340 --> 02:00:31.860]
There are three times a week anyway

[02:00:31.860 --> 02:00:34.560]
Have we had one person's facts or call and say

[02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:38.600]
You know, when I tried that and my blood sugar went skyrocketing or was very good or anything?

[02:00:38.920 --> 02:00:40.460]
No, or die, no, no it's not

[02:00:40.460 --> 02:00:42.020]
No, maybe they're all dead

[02:00:42.020 --> 02:00:43.700]
No, because they're much ingrates

[02:00:43.700 --> 02:00:46.160]
I mean, you know, would they have ever found out about it if it wasn't for

[02:00:46.160 --> 02:00:46.840]
They'll come!

[02:00:47.340 --> 02:00:50.660]
And I was just by the luck of their all that I found it online just to blind luck

[02:00:50.660 --> 02:00:52.780]
But man, we turned down to something really great

[02:00:52.780 --> 02:00:56.640]
And you're buying it up like a hotcakes there at the public's as they can't even keep it in stock

[02:00:56.640 --> 02:00:58.560]
And Georgia has to order it online

[02:00:58.560 --> 02:01:00.460]
But we hear nothing as usual

[02:01:00.460 --> 02:01:06.980]
Terrell Owens, they hate 58, Kobe Bryant 57, I hate this pole 57, P Rose 46, Jose Conzaco 38

[02:01:15.380 --> 02:01:21.700]
Roger Clemens 14, Mark McWire 14, Ron Arthest 13, Kurt Warner 13, speaking of having got a prayer

[02:01:21.700 --> 02:01:25.380]
Keeshawn Johnson, what kind of a name is that? 11, it's a bad name

[02:01:25.380 --> 02:01:29.640]

Then I jumped over the wall and then I thought they don't stop

[02:02:26.460 --> 02:02:32.020]
You told me that I've jumped up, see your hair still, I lost a round some more

[02:02:32.020 --> 02:02:48.080]
And I suspected something funny when I found a bloody glove, a bloody glove

[02:02:49.340 --> 02:02:54.160]
Next thing we knew, AJ went on a low speed, from the right

[02:02:54.920 --> 02:02:59.840]
Now he's in an L.A. jail charge for double on the side

[02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:06.620]
And I believe it's the first degree murder easy to yell, it's because

[02:03:10.340 --> 02:03:16.160]
I'm a bloody clown, I'm a sign of it

[02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:24.660]
Okay, okay, okay, okay, you can't be cool, you can't be cool

[02:03:24.660 --> 02:03:32.920]

An appealing place.

[02:05:47.780 --> 02:05:49.620]
So, who are you?

[02:06:00.420 --> 02:06:01.980]

[02:06:05.280 --> 02:06:11.700]
You know what they use it means, Doug, you can smell the baseball gloves.

You can smell the docks, can't you?

[02:06:15.560 --> 02:06:16.620]
It's not the leather gloves.

[02:06:18.720 --> 02:06:19.720]
Take those no-dos.

[02:06:19.920 --> 02:06:20.980]

Lady Marta is in 7 children.

[02:06:44.520 --> 02:06:46.580]
We have lost our sense of humor in the face of adversity.

[02:06:46.580 --> 02:06:47.960]
We still can chuck a little bit.

[02:07:00.500 --> 02:07:01.580]
Take off those gloves.

[02:07:12.980 --> 02:07:14.460]
It's time to get an eye.

[02:07:14.460 --> 02:07:21.460]
Look at that.

[02:07:24.640 --> 02:07:25.840]
