[00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.400]
The thing I've seen in 30 years.

[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.160]
So I figured that the crossover is longer than your show today.

[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.700]
Alright, that's my idea.

[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.480]
I love those kings, baby.

[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.060]
How to go Wednesday?

[00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:19.800]
100 Waco wins.

[00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.080]
Oh, the dentist.

[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.340]
That's right, you weren't there yesterday.

[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.060]
It was painless, I got a great dentist.

[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.020]
He's fantastic.

[00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.120]
Even when I give you the anesthetic and I give you that long needle, you know.

[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.460]
Yeah.

[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.460]
Usually it pinches.

[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.860]
They hold your lip and they kind of shake it.

[00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.500]
He didn't do any of that nor did I feel anything.

[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.200]
There was no pain.

[00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.880]
The only thing is I had my head, I was laying in the prone position for an hour and 20 minutes with my mouth jammed wide open.

[00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.320]
They put that red rubber ball in your mouth like the one that Joyce's got stuck in her mouth during those SNM sessions.

[00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.060]
And that's the only thing you keep thinking to yourself.

[00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.660]
This will end sometime, won't it?

[00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.780]
You know, but the guy did a phenomenal job.

[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.400]
Man.

[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.480]
And then I found out afterward because he's got like the first part is the drilling with like the small drill, you know.

[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.620]
And then they get out the pneumatic drill and they're like, and your whole head is like vibrating.

[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.020]
And then I realized they stick pins in there.

[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.920]
You know, like when the tooth is gone, they get rid of the shell of it and they stick little pins.

[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.880]
They stick them up into your gum and then they build the tooth around it.

[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.920]
You know that?

[00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.520]
No.

[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.500]
Oh, the stuff they can do now is amazing.

[00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.720]
All you people out there that are terrified of the dentist don't be anymore.

[00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.560]
If you get a good dentist, it's painless now.

[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.420]
I have no pain.

[00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.960]
My root canal guy, no pain lane.

[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.480]
Yeah, he's terrific.

[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.780]
Seek him to night train lane?

[00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.260]
No.

[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.300]
How about Lois lane?

[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.720]
No.

[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.880]
Or Diane lane.

[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.420]
Oh.

[00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:46.040]
I wish all the Marlins rights fees very rights about your buddy, very if they're hailed, which show we hate very jackass like poison and the newspaper.

[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.380]
Although, you know, Miguel sent me the thing that he did on me, that piece they did on my 30th anniversary.

[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.260]
That was pretty nice.

[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.780]
Thanks Kevin, back to your thanks to the photographer lady.

[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.420]
That was good.

[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.940]
Yeah.

[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.960]
That was really nice piece for a change as opposed to the dual hatchet show.

[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.140]
And sure a lot nicer than your buddy Tom Dickad did, which was nothing, just shine me, you know.

[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.100]
That's okay Tom.

[00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.260]
We understand what it's all about.

[00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.600]
Just a petty little puss.

[00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.360]
And your buddy, Sarny, that old turd, he doesn't write anything about.

[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.940]
Oh, 760 in Palm Beach is going to be having Joe Girardi on.

[00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.800]
Wow, what we do, you know.

[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.840]
Anyway, so very jackass, I'm sure you read this about the fire sale by the Marlins and about the QM asking for a rights fee reduction.

[00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.020]
But the Marlins have bought, we're paying three and a half million a year for the rights for the Marlins.

[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.740]
Yeah, I thought it was three, but that's okay.

[00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.680]
Well, very says three and a half and you'll think you know.

[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.000]
Yeah.

[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.300]
And general manager Joe Bell declined to discuss the rights fees. He said it's too early to tell how the station's ad revenue will be affected.

[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.740]
But my guess is there'll be some impact he said if they put like a little league team out there.

[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.300]
You know, there's seven and only seven one and one in exhibitions.

[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.200]
No, that means a lot.

[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.060]
I'll tell you one thing about four seconds of hockey talk.

[00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.900]
The Panther Shocked the Craft Potty.

[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.860]
I mean, man, it was a great move.

[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.240]
Yep.

[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.040]
A ballsy move they put out the books to recite Oli-Okanah.

[00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.540]
I agree.

[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.120]
The only problem is now they got to have a team to play around them.

[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.180]
Yeah, I mean, that would be good.

[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.540]
But at least they've made a mistake.

[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.960]
They've made a mistake.

[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:12.000]
Now if they'd stopped lying about the attendance, you know, Wednesday night they kicked out of his ass right there in the arena, which is unusual.

[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.800]
A lot was damn good.

[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.540]
But there was nobody there.

[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.720]
I watched parts of that on TV.

[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.060]
I mean, nobody there.

[00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.480]
And they put down 15,192 for the attendance.

[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.500]
Is it the paper yesterday?

[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:21.520]
Come on.

[00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:22.620]
Get serious.

[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.240]
Your buddy Alan Cohn, man, you know, they say about figures lie or lies.

[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.780]
Is there something I've been able to do with that?

[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.220]
Huh?

[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.820]
He doesn't bother with that stuff.

[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.880]
You get out of here.

[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.400]
He doesn't.

[00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.000]
Well, whoever the hell is doing it, he's not fooling anybody.

[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.360]
I'm sure they're making a lot of money for those empty seats.

[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.400]
Plus, of course, all those freebies they keep giving away.

[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.420]
If you had any idea as a seasoned ticket holder, how many emails I keep getting from them and things in the mail,

[00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.340]
oh, if you just, well, renew right now, we'll give you like 40 free tickets again.

[00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.940]
And we'll give you like, you know, a date with Enrique Glacier.

[00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.840]
So whatever you want, you know, come on.

[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.040]
Oh, wait.

[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.880]
We wouldn't go to see that garbage if you paid me.

[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.600]
Of course, my team really did a good extra thing.

[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.380]
Nothing.

[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.720]
They got old Luke Richardson and all the hack.

[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.620]
They got rid of one old hack and they got another one.

[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.140]
They did nothing.

[00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.260]
Just amazing.

[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.740]
See, when you have a franchise in the city that's going to fill the place every game in a matter of what you do,

[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.320]
and you have standing remote at every game, it doesn't make any difference and they can get away with that.

[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.520]
So the teachers union here that owns the team, all they care about is the bottom line.

[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.460]
Everyone by the teachers union up there?

[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.720]
Yes.

[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.480]
That's correct.

[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.280]
Maple Leaf Sports Entertainment, which also, of course, owns the Arcana design.

[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.500]
But they don't teach us pretty well.

[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.460]
The Raptors, you know, now I don't think they pay them all that well.

[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.960]
It's where I always go on strike here.

[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.360]
And a good day at Woodbine yesterday.

[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.820]
I had a very funny experience.

[00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.400]
Yeah.

[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.340]
It was a bitch.

[00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.380]
I hate to use that term, but she was there that they be.

[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.640]
She's always there now.

[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.680]
She wants up front the Wheel of Fortune to tie up the first two machines.

[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.740]
Number one and number two.

[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.140]
I'd like to do a number one and a number two right on her head.

[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.820]
Anyway, so she's there going there yesterday and there she is.

[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.840]
Got one and two.

[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:51.460]
So I go down.

[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.300]
There's finally a machine open number five.

[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.880]
I can start putting a hundred bucks just to me.

[00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.760]
Oh, no, I'm going to get off number one.

[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.780]
I know you like this machine.

[00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:58.440]
You can have it.

[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.320]
My favorite machine, because I'm a massacre.

[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.020]
It's like she is.

[00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.380]
And she's losing her ass on both machines.

[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.700]
She's losing and losing.

[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.940]
Oh, I put eight hundred in that one and I put another five hundred to me anyway.

[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.460]
And that's why she's given it to me because it's dead as a door now, you know.

[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.420]
So I sit down.

[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.040]
I put a couple hundred bucks in and that machine was as cold man as a block of ice.

[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.500]
Nothing.

[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:17.880]
Maybe a cherry, you know.

[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.720]
Then I put the third hundred and boom.

[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:20.840]
There's four hundred on the line.

[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.600]
Well, all of a sudden this very friendly phony lady.

[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:24.440]
Oh, my God.

[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.120]
You see that?

[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.900]
And she's talking to whoever sitting to her right, which kept changing.

[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.520]
You know, people would come and go and no matter who was sitting there.

[00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.900]
Oh, look at how lucky he is.

[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.720]
I got four hundred three times on the line.

[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.400]
I got three spends for two fifty.

[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.900]
And every time I get something, she was having a nervous breakdown.

[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.820]
Oh, my God.

[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.920]
Oh, you're so lucky.

[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.180]

[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:41.700]
Make a long story short.

[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.740]
I had a pretty good day.

[00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.900]
I won a few bucks and she left before I did and lost her ass to which I say,

[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.460]
yeah, self is nasty, hateful bitch.

[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.440]
Hey, like you'll hit something and there's these old people there.

[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.460]
These old Russian women, especially.

[00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.840]
And if you hit something, you're sitting waiting to get paid a jackpot like two grand or whatever.

[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.980]
Oh, you're so lucky.

[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.840]
You're so lucky.

[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.940]
In the meantime, even losing, you know, pouring your ass through that place for months now.

[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.100]
Oh, you're so lucky.

[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.140]
And you just want to get up and push them right in the mouth.

[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.700]
Meanwhile, remember the other day you were talking about the slots down here and when they're going to happen.

[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:14.860]
Yeah, I thought you were lying.

[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.000]
What's going on with the Indian casino?

[00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.060]
The Indian powwow.

[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.860]
How deep would they do with that latest Indian deal?

[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.740]
There was a...

[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.440]
There was a...

[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.620]
There was a story the next day in the sunset all about...

[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.500]
I'm sure with no coincidence.

[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.680]
No, it was about...

[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.320]
Or maybe it was that day and I hadn't seen it yet.

[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.460]
But it was about how the Indians have applied.

[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:39.720]
But there's...

[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:45.460]
I guess Broward County has been stalling getting or had for some whatever reason.

[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.040]
This hasn't gotten around and dealing with this and that's what is holding it up.

[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.000]
What is dealing with what?

[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.860]
What does Broward County have to do with the Indians?

[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:52.880]
That's where they are.

[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.440]
No, no, no, it's got nothing to do with it.

[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:54.980]
But the state...

[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.000]
It's the state that regulates it.

[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.480]
I know, but Broward has to do something.

[00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.340]
I forget what it was.

[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.140]
I don't remember all the details of the story.

[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.100]
Yeah, but they said that that's the hang-up right now for all of it.

[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:05.560]
Well, good.

[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.220]
So I hope the paramutrials read them to the punch on this.

[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.880]
Who the hell wants to give the Indians the money?

[00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.580]
When you much rather give it to the paramutrials, they need it.

[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.780]
They can't even sell those cancer sticks like the Indians are doing.

[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.240]
Very unfortunate.

[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.500]
Like everything else that happens in Florida, not fast, not slow, just half fast.

[00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:21.780]
Yep.

[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:22.440]
Pathetic.

[00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:26.780]
So I find out that the Cains were down 13 points at one point in the first half yesterday.

[00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.500]
Well, that's a good thing I didn't know about that.

[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.720]
No, I'm not there.

[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.880]
I would buy it in Georgia where somebody there was supposed to email me with a score.

[00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.060]
So I would at least know what I had prepared to do a four-hour show to there.

[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:38.220]
Just another hour and a half.

[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:40.080]
And nobody has sent me the message.

[00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:41.900]
So see you really need to get a blackberry.

[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.600]
I know you're very anti-internet and all that stuff, but you'd love it.

[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.440]
Being the plunger that you are, you can go online and get all the scores of every game.

[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.960]
Oh, I get the scores on my phone.

[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.080]
Oh, on your phone, okay.

[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:51.340]
Yeah.

[00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:52.440]
So that's what I did.

[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.520]
I went on the internet and I checked your favorite newspaper.

[00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.740]
I checked the Harold website and there was the final score.

[00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.940]
A 66 for Miami and Clemson 63.

[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.120]
And I said, yeah, now we're talking.

[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:05.680]
The only problem with these hour and a half shows is, boy, you could be used to this real easy.

[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:06.200]
Yeah.

[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:08.140]
Yeah.

[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:09.260]
I'm sure.

[00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:10.620]
Oh, yeah, hour and a half.

[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.000]
I think that's about right.

[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.360]
I can't get a couple of those following a late baseball game.

[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:14.560]

[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.920]
Don't you think that's the way it ought to be?

[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.380]
Four hours, three hours, too long.

[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.460]
Hour and a half man could be dynamite every day.

[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:19.960]
I like it.

[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.240]
And then I looked at the schedule next week and Wednesday at 12.50.

[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:24.300]
It's another Marlon game.

[00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:25.380]
Oh, love those.

[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:26.300]
Canes and Os Marlins.

[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:27.620]
Please don't leave Marlins.

[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.280]
Please don't go.

[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.280]
Yeah, that story about them going to San Antonio or what?

[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:32.940]
Yeah, I know.

[00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:33.540]
The joke.

[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.280]
Well, but it's the same thing every time.

[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.240]
It's always the same.

[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:38.200]
And we go through all of these.

[00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.600]
Like I said yesterday, quit threatening to leave already.

[00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:41.980]
If you're going to leave, bye-bye.

[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:42.760]
Have a great life.

[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.260]
We'll pack you a couple of subs and we just get out of here already.

[00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.140]
I don't think there's a chance they can go there.

[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:47.580]
No.

[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:51.500]
First of all, all of a sudden the price of a wallpark is 300 million.

[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.340]
Not only that, but the voters aren't going to approve it in San Antonio or what?

[00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:55.920]
I don't know any of that.

[00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:56.720]
They're going to win.

[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.100]
And they're going to insist on local partnership.

[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.660]
And they're the 38th ranked market in the country.

[00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.740]
Like I said yesterday, about the Skydome.

[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.120]
I was coming home from a woodbine in the cab driver.

[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.240]
It was telling me about the city.

[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:11.040]
I guess the city.

[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:14.300]
The taxpayers paid the bill on it in the first place.

[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:14.540]
Yeah.

[00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.560]
I forget how many hundred millions of cars to build a Skydome and then turn it into a white elephant.

[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.900]
And they couldn't give it away.

[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.440]
So finally, Rogers Cable bought it for $25 million.

[00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:29.840]
So when you parlay something that the taxpayers have spent hundreds of millions into a $25 million boom dial.

[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.700]
And then you name it the Rogers Center.

[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:32.960]
I mean, as much as I appreciate.

[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:33.200]
Yeah.

[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.160]
Why couldn't they just call it the Rogers Skydome?

[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.520]
That's one of the best names of a building anywhere in the world, the Skydome, right?

[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:39.200]
Yeah.

[00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.740]
Rogers Center, my ass.

[00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:41.620]
God.

[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:42.600]
You know what I mean?

[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.800]
That's where it's at.

[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.960]
The stadium in Washington, I was going to talk about.

[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.040]
I was going to, they budgeted it $600 million.

[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:48.440]
Right.

[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:51.320]
I think that's what it cost to build a Skydome with $600 million.

[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:56.700]
San Francisco, which was built five years ago with a ballpark there without a roof, cost $400 million.

[00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:57.100]
Yeah.

[00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.420]
So how can they build a roof for $300 million?

[00:09:59.500 --> 00:09:59.920]
They can't.

[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:01.040]
And it's very important.

[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:07.660]
Anyway, between the writer, of course, says, well, they say, real construction costs are less in Texas.

[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:08.400]
Yeah.

[00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:09.560]
That much less?

[00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:10.200]
Sure.

[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.940]
They bring in all their cheap help from across the border.

[00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.920]
In fact, Bush has built a special tunnel.

[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:20.800]
You know how they keep showing all these tunnels they got a special tunnel in there to bring it all to the league of the great pickers from Mexico.

[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.200]
Well, it's time for you to go.

[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.660]
Oh, it's been a long time ago since it's all the time.

[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:27.540]
But we don't have time to mess around today.

[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:29.900]
What are you laughing about?

[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:30.280]
You.

[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.540]
You got the life today.

[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.700]
I do have the life.

[00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:33.800]
Make no mistake about it.

[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.400]
I would never deny that.

[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.120]
Got to talk real fast today.

[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.280]
Well, it's not a great day.

[00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:39.360]
You're doing a good weekend.

[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:43.100]
Great weekend in the happy forum and the happy St. Paddy's day.

[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.080]
Best to you too.

[00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:44.980]
All of these things.

[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:45.740]
All of these things.

[00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:46.200]
See it.

[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:49.280]
Top of the cheek and how we see the past fires so good.

[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:50.680]
He's jumping right in front of the rim.

[00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:52.740]
Why don't he quickly hit Robby?

[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.780]
Rising and slam dunk with the left hand.

[00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:56.400]
A monster slam.

[00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:58.760]
A one handed.

[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.960]
Left hand slam by Rob Heights.

[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.860]
Tonight on the Islamic cartoon network, it's Elmer Fudge of Mentally.

[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:12.140]
Very, very quiet.

[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.380]
I'm issuing a far-tower.

[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.980]
Now, you've seen J. Z.

[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.360]
Perform on the Grammys with Paul McCartney.

[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.480]
Get straight on yesterday.

[00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.480]
And now, the whole becomes out of retirement.

[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.060]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.160]
To do it with all the legend.

[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:34.720]

[00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:35.900]

[00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:37.160]
Oh.

[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:37.160]

[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:38.760]
Oh.

[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.000]
Oh.

[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:41.000]

[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:41.480]
J. Z.

[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:43.180]
Oh.

[00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:43.920]
Oh.

[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:45.120]
Oh.

[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:45.820]
Oh.

[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:46.940]
Oh.

[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.560]
You've never heard more beautiful to Weston D.

[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:51.020]
Yeah.

[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:51.620]
Yeah.

[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:52.500]
Yeah.

[00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:52.840]
Yeah.

[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:53.520]
Yeah.

[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:55.880]
J. Z.

[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.460]
Do wedding with the legend.

[00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.020]
Yeah, why is hot, y'all?

[00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.720]
Well, all due respect to my good friend, Steven Tyler.

[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.480]
Have you noticed that over the years, he's looking more and more like a woman?

[00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:05.460]
Over the years?

[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:06.780]
Yeah, more and more.

[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.480]
I'm not saying he never goes into first place, but more and more like a woman.

[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.720]
No, I hadn't noticed it.

[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.120]
No lady with big loose lips.

[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:12.840]
I just...

[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:13.220]
Oh, there's an empty tent.

[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.400]
Oh, interrupt now.

[00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:15.900]
Sorry, I'm going to have to ask you around.

[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:16.120]
Okay.

[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.520]
Man, we got a like a fool steam ahead.

[00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:20.320]
Love those canes, man.

[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.080]
Oh, god, they came through in fine four minutes today.

[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.020]
They will get their ass kicked today by the Humper's team Duke.

[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.400]
Love them, uh, 30.

[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.660]
We got the Hurricane Warmup and we got UM in Duke from the ACC tournament in the Greensboro,

[00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:32.440]
North Carolina.

[00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:33.980]
Why do I always want to say South Carolina?

[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:34.780]
I don't know.

[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.520]
And nothing could be fired than the State of Carolina.

[00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:42.220]
UM, a duke at noon, and so we'll be out here at 11.30, to which we say,

[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:42.880]
All right.

[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.060]
If you're starving for a really great meal at a really tiny price,

[00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:50.120]
John, the Baker is the place for you two locations on Pine's Boulevard in the Home Depot,

[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.780]

[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.540]
at the Sterling Town Center, Sterling and Pine Island in prestigious Cooper City.

[00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:00.200]
All kinds of fantastic Italian homemade goodies, everything is fresh and delicious.

[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.240]
They give you big fat portions at teeny tiny prices.

[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:07.820]
Sausage and peppers, chicken parmesan, baked ziti lasagna, zidians, the things to choose from,

[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.440]
and don't forget John the Baker's world famous garlic rolls,

[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:13.100]
just juicy and dripping with garlic in as big as your head.

[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.640]
And, George and Josh should try to about everything on a menu from that fantastic,

[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.540]
sloppy sausage sub to get all spaghetti and meat balls,

[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.440]
and they are rave about them all and you will too.

[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:24.360]
And don't forget, some of the best pizza you've ever had as well.

[00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:26.420]
Bring the whole family or call a head for takeout,

[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:31.260]
and Pembroke Pines called John the Baker at 954-431-43515,

[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:35.620]
or a Cooper City at 954-252-0091.

[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.120]
Always like I said, huge portions and always the best and freshest Italian food in town.

[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.780]
It doesn't get no better than John the Baker.

[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.020]
This is the new Roger's.

[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.400]
This is 5.62-8.

[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.060]
Take off those checkered pants.

[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:23.460]
What the hell did we do?

[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.300]
Do keep this wider we are hanging.

[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.320]
That's who George is.

[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:34.180]
Oh, she's a boolean.

[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:35.320]
Oh, she's a boolean.

[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.240]
Give it a good stir right to do it.

[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.220]
Oh, she's a boolean.

[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:40.820]
Oh, she's a boolean.

[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.520]
A precious boolean.

[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.080]
Sears on us, I believe,

[00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:51.080]
through a home to where he is.

[00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.220]
Stop, we don't dispatch it.

[00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:57.140]
But she must not say.

[00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.240]
Oh, she's a boolean.

[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.000]
Oh, she's a boolean.

[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.340]
I hope you believe you.

[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:04.980]
Throw away your weight, baby.

[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:07.400]
Oh, she's a boolean.

[00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:09.280]
A precious boolean.

[00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:11.960]
What you have, what you have, what you have, what you have, what you have.

[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.660]
Oh, she's a boolean.

[00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:16.180]
Oh, she's a boolean.

[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:20.200]
That's great of a lot of people.

[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:21.740]
It's a 10-18.

[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.280]
That's great.

[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:24.980]
That's great.

[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.780]
Mass graves of a lot of people.

[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.400]
That's exactly what he specializes in.

[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:29.300]
Doing a heck of a job.

[00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:32.420]
What college university despised the most?

[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.260]
That was our poor yesterday.

[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.560]
We love hurricanes now.

[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:35.780]
God, we love it.

[00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:37.300]
1588 votes.

[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:38.760]
Notre Dame 364.

[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:39.880]
Was there any doubt about it?

[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:40.180]
No.

[00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.020]
This spies Notre Dame.

[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.040]
Touchdown Jesus, my ass.

[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.000]
5 Jones University 224.

[00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:47.160]
It's a good thing you came up with that.

[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:47.660]
Yeah.

[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.560]
I would have had something to vote for that.

[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.040]
University of Miami 202.

[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.360]
They probably would have done better, but winning that game for us yesterday.

[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.020]
They made people a little bit more Gentile toward them.

[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.860]
Gators UF 172, Gatorhater.

[00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:02.400]
So UFM did better than Gators or FSU, which was next with 125.

[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.200]
I hate this poll 117.

[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.460]
Always does well.

[00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:06.900]
None 95.

[00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:07.780]
Don't hate anybody.

[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:08.680]
Well, boring.

[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.080]
Oral Roberts 73.

[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:11.360]
Ohio State 63.

[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:12.680]
Liberty of Baptist College 34.

[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:14.300]
Jerry Falball.

[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:15.500]
Yale 24.

[00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:16.860]
Michigan 20.

[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:17.320]
Oh.

[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:18.700]
Harvard 18.

[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.520]
Duke 14.

[00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:20.420]
Texas 13.

[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:21.440]
USC 11.

[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:22.800]
Michigan State only 7.

[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:23.940]
What's not to like?

[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.480]
UCLA 6 and Penn State only 6.

[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:30.580]
I would have thought Penn State would have done better just because of Joe Pa and those crappy uniform.

[00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.100]
Well, can you think?

[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:32.920]
Yeah.

[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.800]
I mean, my only one that hates him like poison thinks that he's just a cranky old man who's way out of control.

[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.820]
I mean, I don't hate him, but he's definitely a cranky old man who's at a control.

[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.600]
Well, at least just like him a little bit.

[00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:44.560]
Anyway, how about that port steal?

[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:45.300]
All right.

[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:49.860]
And George now has become a, I think you're involved in new religion now.

[00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:50.200]
Right.

[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.180]
The Dobsian religion.

[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:52.740]
Lou does.

[00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:54.300]
I turned out to Lou Dobson.

[00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:55.580]
Now George doesn't miss it every night.

[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:56.440]
Got to bid.

[00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:00.100]
So the thing is, you don't realize the transformation that took place on that.

[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:01.300]
I don't know him for anybody.

[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:06.900]
A lightning bolt came from up above and something turned this formerly administration-looking jackass,

[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:10.760]
who was just another toad on the TV, into like a hell razor.

[00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:16.640]
You know, the Arab Emirates own DP World, say, yesterday it would transfer its operations of American ports to a US entity.

[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:21.820]
After congressional leaders reportedly told your president that the firms take over, you know, was essentially dead.

[00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:22.740]
I'm Capitol Hill.

[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:29.240]
Do, do, because of the strong relationship between the United Arab Emirates and the United States had to preserve that relationship,

[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:34.140]
DP World will transfer fully the US operations of PNO or that P.U.

[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:40.780]
PNO operations are with America to a United States entity, Edward Bilky, the P. World's the Chief Operating Officer of the Senate statement.

[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:44.180]
The announcement didn't specify, though, which US company would be involved.

[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:49.340]
So before we get too excited, there are people like, yeah, hold on a second.

[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.360]
Okay, that's enough.

[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:54.440]
Oh, that was special.

[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.520]
Before we get too carried away, but at least some good was accomplished.

[00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:02.160]
Finally, we want the era of the CCADO stop now.

[00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:03.260]
Howard Bil will be proud.

[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:05.900]
And Josh is saying, Howard Bil, who's that?

[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.060]
Here's today's poll, and we need a lot of help on this.

[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.700]
Although, I don't know, maybe they don't have any.

[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:14.180]
A TV show pastor present that you love will never admit to it.

[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.080]
What do we got so far? Already 470 votes. It's kind of weak.

[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.480]
He haused 64. I hate this poll.

[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.920]
We'll be number one in 47. I forgot about that.

[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.100]
Had George at it this morning already is zooming up there.

[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.720]
They hate everything. Everything everybody.

[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.360]
This is South Florida, F and away.

[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:28.120]
BAM!

[00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:30.580]
Batman, 38.

[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.280]
It's about Bil. Let's go.

[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:32.860]
Okay.

[00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.520]
Andy Griffiths, 036.

[00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:38.160]
Flipper, 34.

[00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:40.120]
Well, I'd be ashamed to be a bit of an active.

[00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:41.100]
You've enjoyed Joe.

[00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:42.120]
But I voted for it.

[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:43.740]
But he watches for different reasons than I do.

[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.220]
Hey, Luke. Is that a flu?

[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.200]
Say, call him triple, triple.

[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:51.180]
Breedy, bunch 33.

[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:53.700]
Any soap opera 28 like guiding light?

[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.000]
Boy, they screw that thing up.

[00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.360]
Of the real world, 26.

[00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:58.240]
Gomer's piles, 26.

[00:18:58.580 --> 00:18:59.520]
You think Gomer has piles?

[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:00.440]
Probably no.

[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:01.940]
Partridge family, 19.

[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.080]
Desperate housewives, 18.

[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:04.820]
That's the one with Miguel on it.

[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:05.200]
Yeah.

[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:06.380]
Quiris folk, 13.

[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:07.620]
Joe, millionaire, 12.

[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:08.880]
Party of five, nine.

[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:09.800]
Speaking of...

[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:10.660]
Speaking of gay.

[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:11.820]
What the hell was that kid's name?

[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:12.580]
Scott Wolfe.

[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.060]
Was that it?

[00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:13.860]
Gaskin' me.

[00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:15.220]
Party of five, that's screamer.

[00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:20.340]
Dr. Phil9, Twin Peaks 8, LN8, Oprah 7, dark shadow 6

[00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:22.300]
with Barnabas shorts, whatever his name was.

[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:22.680]
Remember that?

[00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:23.140]
No.

[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:24.100]
Yeah, you do.

[00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:27.500]
You admitted he watched that show and it...

[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:28.360]
I didn't make it through once.

[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.260]
Well, all I remember about his name was Barnabas.

[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.520]
Are you hot, 6?

[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:32.920]
That was a good show and they took it off.

[00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:33.920]
I have no idea why.

[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:34.460]
Lorenzo.

[00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:36.440]
So what's that guy to do with it?

[00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:39.800]
He was using the laser and that was a copy of what Howard was doing

[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.380]
and Howard was threatening to sue them.

[00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:43.040]
And the networks that audit it worth it

[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.640]
doesn't have that good ratings anyway and they just dropped it.

[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.080]
But they had some pretty hot people on there.

[00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:47.500]
Yeah, they did.

[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.000]
Well, I'm on it back.

[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.200]
The apprentice 6, the Arrhyde Factor 5, wrote rules for.

[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.700]
Speaking of shows, there was some pretty hot people on it

[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:58.260]
and making the band for and the read across, be sure, only four.

[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.500]
Well, that's not because people are ashamed to admit it does

[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:01.700]
because nobody would watch it.

[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:02.280]
When you think?

[00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:02.740]
Right.

[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:04.420]
That's what I'm thinking right now.

[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.420]
Yeah, let's have another lost co-ed.

[00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:07.360]
They're there.

[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:10.920]
Oh, I just keep doing what I want to talk about it.

[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.820]
14,495 for a band and pet rescue.

[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.420]
That's a pretty weak total of yes, me.

[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.220]
Yesterday we came up with 100 bucks at that fandom location

[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:19.740]
and we got two more ones for you today.

[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.320]
Let's look at the scheduler.

[00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:24.920]
Curtis 2-4, mad dog at Coneines, Grille, 4-7.

[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:26.560]
Panther, PV with 7 o'clock.

[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.540]
Nice going every side and Oli-Yokin and man,

[00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.200]
they find that it's something that's with some balls.

[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:32.620]
Now you just need a few more guys like 10.

[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.360]
Panther's in Carolina, Hurricanes 7-30 tonight

[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.060]
and it decay after the hockey game.

[00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:38.640]
Any interest in that NHL draft?

[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:38.920]
Oh.

[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:43.260]
So 4-7 during the mad dog show Josh Cortis will be there at Coneines.

[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.020]
Grille 51-81 Sheridan Street in Hollywood

[00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:47.180]
and he promises to raise for at least 100 bucks.

[00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:48.300]
No.

[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:49.740]
Yeah, sure.

[00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:50.500]
I brought it.

[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.440]
If I would have said 500 or something would have been ridiculous,

[00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:54.760]
100 bucks you can do that.

[00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:55.580]
I hope so.

[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.040]
If I had a red bandage up for a few bucks, he can afford it.

[00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:58.720]
Believe me.

[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.260]
And tomorrow from 3-5, even on a Saturday,

[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.420]
little George has to work because he's got mouth to feed.

[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:04.280]
Oh, yeah.

[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:04.680]
Dick was.

[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:05.560]
And he's got that.

[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:09.400]
Well, George had often stayed in for the Maroonie auto 10 sale 3-5.

[00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.980]
And of course, the CDs and commemorative T-shirts 20 bucks a piece

[00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:13.660]
have benefited band and pair of asking for a lot of deal.

[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.840]
And Miguel sent me a nice package yesterday.

[00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:18.040]
Wasn't the one I was hoping for, but it was okay.

[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.580]
And had the T-shirt in it and the CD and also that hero article

[00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.320]
like I told the hamper, that was nice piece.

[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.640]
Thanks Kevin Baxter and the photographer lady.

[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.520]
I wish I knew her name, which I don't, but she was very nice.

[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:31.840]
So for once in my life, the hero treats me with respect, you know?

[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.900]
Although Ellie Brecker did a nice piece too on the 25th, I believe.

[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:35.380]
Remember that?

[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:35.920]
Go to Ellie.

[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:36.380]
Sure.

[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.180]
Oh, he's me, Brecker.

[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:39.720]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:40.800]
Hello, I was on the prairie.

[00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:42.820]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:44.420]
NHL drafts today.

[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:46.080]
I beg your pardon?

[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.780]
Are they NHL drafts?

[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:50.200]
Through the papers you're going to get in the 700th round.

[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:51.960]
Oh, stay tuned, you'll find out.

[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.100]
The oldie will tell you.

[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:54.200]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:55.500]
Q-A-M.

[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.500]
And that guy there guys making a joke about the NHL draft,

[00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:01.480]
which was yesterday and more on, but the NFL drafts is like a,

[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.140]
it's not a show on this station or I'm sure across the street.

[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:04.880]
It's like a digital show.

[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:04.880]

[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:05.920]
It's a disease, it's a mental illness.

[00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:07.020]
It's a sentence.

[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.720]
And we have to have B-No on there and we have to have all the other mavenes,

[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:15.320]
the experts, prognosticating and proliferating the airwaves with their swill.

[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:18.760]
But I'm going to put them up and that's 10-year-old kid in Oklahoma, man.

[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:22.800]
He's going to be a number one quarterback and he's going to get drafted in the first round by, yeah, right.

[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.880]
But so you may call it all you wanted, the NHL draft, which was overkill and here,

[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:27.860]
like you wouldn't believe yesterday.

[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.440]
I mean, just like I'm disease, but an American disease is the NFL draft.

[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:32.680]
It's a disease.

[00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:33.880]
It's a figure of disease.

[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.120]
It's in the supplemental.

[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.220]
26 past 10 at 560 WQM.

[00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:39.440]
Beach Ford has gone mad.

[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.580]
They don't have a disease, but it's madness in March all this month at Beach Ford.

[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:45.140]
They just missed breaking their all-time record last month,

[00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:46.620]
so they're going to do it this month and why not?

[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:47.460]
What's not to like?

[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:51.840]
Because right now extended camp Ford 150s, there was lowest 249 bucks a month,

[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:54.280]
would 995 bucks down?

[00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:55.900]
Let me start over again.

[00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:56.400]
Okay.

[00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:58.560]
What?

[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:00.140]
Why do you think what I said?

[00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:00.640]
Yeah, I did.

[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.180]
That was great.

[00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:02.700]
Beach Ford has gone mad.

[00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:04.220]
Well, that's what I'd like to do at times.

[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.200]
It's madness in March all this month at Beach Ford.

[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:09.280]
They just missed breaking their record last month and they're going to break it this month.

[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.400]
Right now extended camp Ford 150s.

[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:12.240]
Let's see if I can do it again.

[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:18.280]
Our lowest 249 bucks a month, with 995 bucks down plus fees for the pro-quredit and a 39-month lease.

[00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:19.300]
First of all, I didn't say bucks.

[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:19.600]
Sorry.

[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:24.360]
Magnus in March at Beach Ford means you must be mad if you don't take advantage of rebates and discounts

[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:28.420]
of up to 10 grand and all new and used vehicles if you're not in the market for a new car,

[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.720]
but know somebody who is send their action to Beach Ford.

[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:34.760]
Because if they take delivery and March Beach Ford will send you $200 in cash.

[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:37.020]
And that money comes from the advertising budget.

[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.840]
They won't check up the price $200 for your friend and screw him.

[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:41.480]
Don't miss out on this one of your event.

[00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:46.320]
Beach Ford's madness in March extended camp Ford 150s low as 249 bucks a month,

[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:51.180]
discounts and rebates up to $10,000 and $200 in cash just for sending via friend.

[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:56.260]
Hurray and Beach Ford is just two miles east of the Golden Glades on 163rd Street, West Exit Highway.

[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.580]
You'll love your Beach Ford experience.

[00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:01.100]
This is Neil Rogers.

[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:04.900]
This is 560 QA.

[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:05.820]
Oh my god.

[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.240]
Were you grudged back in?

[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.980]
Don't let it dump, don't let it dump, don't let it dump,

[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:12.620]
the why why why did I die?

[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.860]
I die part of the city card.

[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:18.640]
Turn the door, turn the door, turn the door.

[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:25.000]
Turn the door, turn the door, turn the door, turn the door.

[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.180]
Turn the door, turn the door, turn the door, turn the door.

[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.100]
Turn the door, turn the door, turn the door.

[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:34.040]
Turn the door, turn the door, turn the door.

[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:34.120]
Turn the door, turn the door, turn the door.

[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:34.120]

[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:34.900]
Turn the door, turn the door, turn the door.

[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:38.600]
Turn the door, turn the door, turn the door.

[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.180]
Turn the door, turn the door, turn the door.

[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.120]
Turn the door, turn the door, turn the door.

[00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:43.940]
Turn the door, turn the door, turn the door.

[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:47.080]
Turn the door, turn the door, turn the door.

[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.620]
Turn the door, turn the door, turn the door.

[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:58.240]
Turn the door, turn the door, turn 물어� chants.

[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:13.620]
Sept 20th Generalwoman His Exhausted New Report

[00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:15.660]
his mouth with a speech defect on top of it.

[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:16.120]
And loudly.

[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.560]
A new report advanced to raw story yesterday

[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.680]
suggested Chris Matthews, the star of MSNBC's daily talk

[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:25.000]
of Tured Hardball, has accepted healthy speaking fees

[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.140]
from an array of conservative trade associations.

[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.640]
Seeks try so hard like present himself

[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:32.780]
as a moderate like that fat-faced pasty Irishman Tim

[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:34.060]
Russell on eat the press.

[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:35.600]
And the fact of him is that they both

[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.280]
have been bought and paid for by the right wing.

[00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:40.280]
Matthews is given speeches to release

[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.980]
10 major conservative trade associations since 2001.

[00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:46.460]
The reports author Dave Johnson, who blogs at seeing the forest

[00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:48.660]
and is now a fellow with a progressive commonwealth institute,

[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:51.340]
could find no records indicating that Matthews had ever spoken

[00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:53.400]
before any democratic leading organizations.

[00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:56.100]
The report is not a product of the commonwealth institute.

[00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:58.700]
Why is Matthews speaking at so many events

[00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:00.320]
with a public and associated trade organization,

[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.280]
Johnson asked, what is NBC policy on speaking engagements?

[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.040]
And why does NBC keep it hidden?

[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.700]
Are these trade associations paying

[00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.000]
Matthews to purchase influence?

[00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:10.340]
Matthews is listed as speaking bureau

[00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:11.600]
in order to command healthy fees,

[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:12.500]
while it can't be proven

[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:14.160]
where the Matthews has taken money from the groups.

[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:17.340]
Speaking fees are a regular practice for large trade organizations

[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:20.160]
who invite big name media stars to speak to their memberships.

[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.320]
Such fees typically run on the five-figure range

[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.400]
and occasionally exceed $50,000 per engagement.

[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:27.320]
And then the stories on our website,

[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.360]
and you can click on the link and show the whole report.

[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.600]
And all these people that are buying and paying

[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:34.400]
for a talk out of the side of his mouth, Chris Matthews,

[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.020]
Jack Asks.

[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:36.100]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:36.760]
Hey, Neil.

[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:37.400]
Yes, sir.

[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.420]
Hey, how's the weather in Toronto towards the end of April?

[00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:42.220]
Does that going to be up that area?

[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:43.700]
Ah, Cloudy and Murphy.

[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:45.120]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:45.760]
Well.

[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:46.380]
Yes.

[00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:49.640]
QYM, weather central.

[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:51.180]
Hello.

[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:52.840]
QYM.

[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.360]
Yeah, this is Jeff and Miami.

[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.280]
I speak to Neil.

[00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:55.940]
Okay.

[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:57.380]
Let's go to Jeff and Miami.

[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:57.760]
Hello.

[00:26:58.460 --> 00:26:59.360]
Hello, this is Jeff.

[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:00.400]
Hello, Jeff.

[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:01.280]
Yes, it is.

[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:01.980]
What do you got?

[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:04.660]
Hey, I just want to speak to him real quick

[00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:05.820]
about the forecast.

[00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:07.320]
About what?

[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:08.700]
About the forecast.

[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:09.740]
I went through the tricky word.

[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:10.700]
But they went in the trash can.

[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:13.740]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:14.380]
Neil.

[00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:15.040]
Yes, sir.

[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.840]
Fine, you missed that show.

[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:17.440]
I'm too hot.

[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.040]
I was on a runner up on that show.

[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:19.740]
Very hot.

[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:20.140]
Yeah.

[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.220]
WDQYM, that's why it's off to you here.

[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:24.780]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:25.940]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:26.500]
Okay.

[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:28.800]
Now, one, thanks for your recommendation

[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.060]
of American History Up.

[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.220]
So watch that last night.

[00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:31.700]
Absolutely.

[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:32.300]
Really good movie.

[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:33.780]
Yeah, that's a great fantastic.

[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.180]
Thank you very much.

[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:35.900]
You're welcome.

[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:36.180]
Thank you.

[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:38.620]
5.6.7, I guess nobody's going to add to this pool.

[00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.520]
And if that's the case, it's fine with me,

[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.520]
because we only got like 55 minutes.

[00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:43.100]
That's right.

[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.080]
A TV show past your present that you loved

[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:45.840]
but would never admit it.

[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:46.880]
I guess they just don't want to admit it.

[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.060]
Somebody might recognize their voice.

[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:49.800]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.560]
Can I sniff your car, Neil?

[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:52.300]
Cool.

[00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:54.120]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:55.740]
Oh, Neil.

[00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:56.600]
Yes, sir.

[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.220]
Goodbye, do bye.

[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:00.640]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:02.040]
Marie, go.

[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:03.880]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:05.920]
Hey, Neil, how about the old, golden girls?

[00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:07.740]
Got to start getting to you with a riot, man.

[00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:09.460]
OK, golden girls, that's a good one.

[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.380]
Who the hell would watch that?

[00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:12.920]
Only some old gay toad.

[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:13.580]
Wouldn't you think?

[00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:15.560]
Indeed, the old and the old.

[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:16.040]
So there you go.

[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.640]
Now we think about 20, and there was one here

[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:18.420]
actually had a suggestion.

[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:19.600]
So that's not bad.

[00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:20.620]
There's a little lesson for it.

[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:21.160]
How to do this.

[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:23.920]
Take about 6,000 calls, and you'll get, I would say,

[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:24.920]
about 30 minutes.

[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:26.000]
That actually makes some sense.

[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.820]
And then the other ones are very amusing and entertaining,

[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:28.300]
they think.

[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.540]
Underline net part, they think.

[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:33.360]
Oh, yeah, you're a wee-aw-patter.

[00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:35.820]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:39.760]
It's all as good as Sid Rosenstein calling up Ronnie Bennington.

[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:40.260]
Yes, sir.

[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:41.940]
How about the Walton?

[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.260]
They can't say I love this, but I like watching that, too.

[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.040]
For what?

[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:46.040]
Wouldn't you like John Boy?

[00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:47.000]
The Walton.

[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:47.840]
I don't know.

[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:50.620]
Just for this whole, uh, whole ambiance here.

[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:52.900]
It was real, real heinous, as they are going to say heinous.

[00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:54.280]
OK, the Walton's is good.

[00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:55.100]
We'll put it up.

[00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:56.220]
John Boy, I forgot that thing.

[00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:57.780]
Richard Thomas was, that is me.

[00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:58.140]
That's right.

[00:28:58.300 --> 00:28:59.980]
No, it's still there, and it's getting bigger every day.

[00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:01.960]
Got that big mole of the size of a baseball.

[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:03.140]
Got it's on zip code now.

[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:04.780]
WDQYM, it's on zip.

[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:06.380]
Yeah, huh.

[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.340]
He needs to be shot.

[00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:09.820]
I want you to take care of this over the weekend.

[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:11.420]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:12.940]
Hey, Neil, how are you doing today?

[00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:13.420]
OK.

[00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:17.400]
Hey, do you still have that beautiful Samsung, uh, DLBHV TV?

[00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:18.200]
Yes, I do.

[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:21.900]
What's your service that you're using, your HD service?

[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:22.980]
A bigger pardon?

[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.600]
What's your HD service you're using?

[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:26.660]
You're using direct TV?

[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:27.500]
What are you using?

[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.320]
It comes from my cable, my digital cable.

[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:32.900]
Well, you got like Comcast, something like that.

[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.040]
Something like that, yeah.

[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:35.680]
Oh, how many channels you got?

[00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:36.480]
About 50.

[00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:37.460]
HD?

[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:38.020]
50?

[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:39.400]
No, I think 25.

[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:40.240]
About 25.

[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:41.680]
About 30, I think.

[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:42.780]
About 30, man.

[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:45.680]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.060]
Hey, get that man down the homestead now.

[00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:52.240]
I guess he doesn't have Roger's digital cable like I do, so he's missing out.

[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:53.640]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:54.700]
Chilton, Neil.

[00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:55.460]
Yes, sir.

[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:57.680]
Uh, time tunnel.

[00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:58.620]
Great show.

[00:29:58.940 --> 00:29:59.900]
The time tunnel.

[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:00.680]
Uh-huh.

[00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:01.460]
Would James Dieren?

[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:02.340]
There you go.

[00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:03.140]
OK, thanks.

[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:04.100]
Remember that show?

[00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:06.200]
That was 100 years ago, but this guy must be old like me.

[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.140]
Why is that embarrassing?

[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:07.840]
That was a good show.

[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.280]
Well, I mean, cheesy, but what was good about it?

[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.940]
Yeah, it was good because it was cheesy.

[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:12.400]
It was great.

[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:13.380]
Let's all go to camp.

[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:16.420]
I know somebody like to set us all to camp relatively early in my presence.

[00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:16.960]
Yeah.

[00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:20.220]
Oh, oh, oh.

[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:24.520]
And speaking of Bozo, Bush's approval ratings fall to a new low.

[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:28.700]
Just when you can't think that when you think they can't get no lower, how low can

[00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:29.160]
they go?

[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:29.200]
No.

[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:34.080]
More and more people, especially Republicans, disapprove of a, uh, Bush, myster's performance,

[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:38.280]
question his character and no longer consider him a strong leader against terrorism, according

[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:42.980]
to the brand new AP Ipsos poll documenting one of the bleakest points of his own presidency.

[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.400]
That get a weapon of mass destruction.

[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:47.380]
No, he sure is.

[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:52.820]
Nearly four out of five Americans, including 70% of Republicans believe civil war will

[00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:54.420]
break out in Iraq if it hasn't already.

[00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:57.060]
The bloody hotspot upon which Bush has taken his presidency.

[00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:01.740]
Nearly 70% of all people in the U.S. say the U.S. is on the wrong track.

[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:03.620]
A six point jumps in just last month.

[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:06.920]
70% nearly say we're on the wrong track.

[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:08.180]
We're at Belmont.

[00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:09.140]
We should be at Aqueduct.

[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.440]
Belmont's closed right now.

[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:12.040]
I'm not happy with how to amward.

[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:15.220]
Hazel Park, we should be at Northville, watching Brad Cramer and his town routine.

[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.200]
I'm not happy with how things are going.

[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:21.480]
Said Margaret Campanelia, a referee in Norwich, Connecticut, Norwich, who said she tends

[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.140]
to vote Republican.

[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:25.520]
I'm especially not happy with Iraq, not happy with how things work with Katrina.

[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:30.700]
Republican Party leader said the survey explains why GOP lawmakers are rushing to distance

[00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:35.400]
themselves from Bush on a range of issues, for security that good-by-do-by deal, immigration,

[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.500]
spending, warrantless eavesdropping, and trade.

[00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:39.960]
For example, all of these things.

[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:43.600]
The positioning is most intense among Republicans facing election this November.

[00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:44.300]
What a surprise.

[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:49.500]
And those considering presidential campaigns in 2008, even the obnoxious ultra-right wing

[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:53.840]
fanatic maniac, Senator Sam Brown back of Kansas, a potential presidential candidate

[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:57.760]
God forbid says, you're in the position of this cycle now that is difficult anyway,

[00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:01.860]
and second off to your term elections, there gets to be this familiarity factor.

[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.660]
You have to admit you were familiar with it, and we're familiar with you too, San,

[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:05.080]
go away.

[00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:06.020]
You fascist.

[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:09.880]
The polls suggest that most Americans wonder whether Bush is up to the job.

[00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:13.960]
The survey conducted Monday through Wednesday of this week of a thousand people found that

[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:18.700]
just 37% of his overall performance sets the lowest of his presidency in this particular

[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:18.980]
poll.

[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.300]
I think the lowest number we've seen all together last week was like 34.

[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:22.980]
Am I correct?

[00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:23.520]
Yes, right.

[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:29.400]
Bush's job of provowating among Republicans plummeted from 82% in February to 74%.

[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:34.680]
A dangerous sign in the midterm election year when parties rely on enthusiasm from their

[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:38.080]
most loyal voters, the biggest losses were among white males.

[00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:38.760]
Well, good.

[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:40.220]
It's about time they started catching on.

[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:45.300]
By a 47 to 36 margin, people favor Democrats over Republicans when asked who should control

[00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:45.720]
Congress.

[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:47.080]
There you go.

[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.880]
Those wonderful, spineless Democrats.

[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.040]
They're really doing it, baby.

[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:50.580]
Not.

[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:54.780]
Speaking of doing it, let's get with that band of pet rescue campaign.

[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:57.700]
We're going to, because if we can raise some serious cash for them, then I'll take that

[00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:59.020]
story that you were telling me.

[00:32:59.140 --> 00:32:59.500]
All right.

[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:01.120]
These Neil Rogers.

[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:02.540]
This.

[00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:03.660]
We're going to have something to do with them.

[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:04.300]
We're going to be going to shiny.

[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:04.800]
Yeah.

[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:10.140]
That shows real girls crushing their goods during spring break week in Florida.

[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:12.000]
What about the hotties?

[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:13.720]
Who spent the whole year in Florida?

[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.700]
Now they've got their own video.

[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:18.240]
It's Golden Girls Gone Wild.

[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:18.920]
Who's here?

[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:20.500]
Why it's all your favorite golden.

[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:24.140]
Golden Girls, Dorothy Rose, Bletch and they always said, I'm just so pleased.

[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.960]
I share the treatment with them that I trashed.

[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:31.180]
Well, you won't have to think because Golden Girls Gone Wild is two full hours of these

[00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:34.400]
ravenous retirees going loads of rickless cans.

[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:37.740]
I am the most attractive and available woman in all of my am.

[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:39.220]
Golden Girls Gone Wild.

[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:43.040]
These hotties, what hot flashes are going topless every chance they get.

[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:44.940]
Except when they're always ready to slay us.

[00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:46.960]
Yeah, I'm going to be even open my grounds again.

[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.160]
It doesn't get any sexier than this.

[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.660]
But they'll take our word for it.

[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:53.520]
Listen to what the golden girls are saying about each other.

[00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:56.400]
She looks like they've been going to Golden Girls Gone Wild.

[00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:59.080]
What's it just one time and you'll agree?

[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:01.660]
That's a dark day in the history of mankind.

[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.260]
Golden Girls Gone Wild.

[00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:03.720]
Golden.

[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:06.200]
M46 at 560 W.Q.

[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:10.460]
I got a great column again by Doug Thompson, Capitol Hill Blue, going for a nurse in a minute.

[00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:10.960]
All right.

[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:15.260]
The first, the chief of an Indian tribe represented by the lobbyist at Cape Rommoth was admitted

[00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:17.340]
to a meeting with President Bush in 2001.

[00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:22.840]
Just days after the tribe paid a prominent conservative lobbying group $25,000 at Mr.

[00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:24.820]
Abramoth's direction, according to documents and interviews.

[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:29.340]
The payment was made to Americans for tax reform a group run by Grover Norquist, one of

[00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:32.220]
the Republican Party's most influential policy strategist.

[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:35.300]
Mr. Norquist was a credit long time associate at Mr. Abramoth.

[00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:40.060]
Mr. Norquist attended the meeting along with Mr. Abramoth and the tribal leader, Raul Garza

[00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:41.960]
of the Kikapoo, traditional tribal Texas.

[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:43.520]
They got great joy, Jews.

[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:44.400]
Oh, yeah.

[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:48.120]
It is not clear what role if any Mr. Norquist played in getting chief Garza into the meeting,

[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:51.900]
and there's no suggestion that the White House was aware of the $25,000 payment right.

[00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:56.520]
But the transaction adds new details to what is known about Mr. Abramoth and how he used

[00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:00.080]
his links to well-connected conservatives to establish himself among his lobbying clients

[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:03.140]
as having access to the highest levels of power in Washington.

[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:05.300]
Mr. Abramoth has pleaded guilty and we know.

[00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:08.880]
This is just a teeny tiny little tip of the iceberg, man.

[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:13.820]
It's going to be like the polar ice caps melting and just flooding the entire globe before

[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:15.760]
that actually happens in a couple of weeks.

[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:16.200]
Oh, that's over.

[00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:16.980]
Right.

[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.500]
Doug Thompson says we don't burn our sources.

[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:23.880]
One of the questions frequently raised by critics of this website is how can you guys

[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.880]
have sources of the mainstream media doesn't have?

[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:26.760]
Good question.

[00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:29.260]
We often quote confidential sources on our stories.

[00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:32.440]
We have a choice of depending on such sources or not publish human story.

[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.160]
If I'm satisfied the sources of the record, I go with a story.

[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:36.680]
It's a question of trust.

[00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:40.160]
And during my 23 years in Washington is both a journalist and a political operative.

[00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:43.440]
I built up an network of sources I trust and who trust me to protect their identity

[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.720]
and not put them in harm's way.

[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.280]
More than 40 years in journalism taught me to protect such sources at all cost.

[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:52.460]
Many of those same sources don't trust the so-called mainstream media outlets because

[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:56.080]
they've been burned by journalists who put the story ahead of protecting those who provide

[00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:56.840]
them with the information.

[00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:01.220]
Even worse, the mainstreamers can be downright sloppy when it comes to protecting those

[00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:03.000]
who have such information.

[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:07.100]
On Monday I outlined how the Bush administration has launched an all-out war on the press,

[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:12.240]
directing Attorney General Alberto Vio-5 Gonzalez to go after reporters with subpoenas, wire

[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:15.960]
taps, monitoring emails and surveillance to try to stop leaks about the many questionable

[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.080]
activities of the White House.

[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:21.340]
I learned about the efforts because the FBI made the incredibly stupid mistake of setting

[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:25.100]
one of their national security letters to a company I own demanding information on one

[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:26.060]
of its clients, me.

[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:30.280]
Then I confirmed the story with my administration sources and ran with it on Monday, knowing

[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:33.140]
that even acknowledging receipt of a national security letter could lead to trouble.

[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:35.920]
Letter was withdrawn after my attorney negotiated deal.

[00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:40.020]
On Tuesday an email arrived from Dan Egan, just a department correspondence for the Washington

[00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:43.000]
Post, Dan wanted a copy of the letter and more information on the story.

[00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:43.800]
That's right.

[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:46.920]
I read a story about how the Bush administration is monitoring the email of journalists

[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:50.960]
and a journalist fires off an email asking me to violate the USA Patriot Act and risked

[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:54.420]
certain jail time by providing him with a copy of a letter not even supposed to admit

[00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:54.860]
I have.

[00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:55.980]
In fact, I don't have it.

[00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:56.460]
I never did.

[00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:00.780]
The FBI sent the letter to my web hosting company offices, which are 300 miles away from

[00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:01.480]
my home in studio.

[00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:05.160]
It my instructions that went from employee who received it straight to my attorney and

[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.260]
he dealt directly with the Feds.

[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:09.880]
I never saw the letter, do not know what happened to it, I'm not privy to details of

[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:10.280]
what it said.

[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:11.100]
I don't want to know.

[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:13.360]
That's why I'm still sitting here not on my way to Gitmo.

[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:17.720]
Then I checked my voice mail to find a call from Robert O. Harrow, Jr., another post reporter

[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.580]
wanting information on my sources.

[00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:20.180]
Wow.

[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:23.320]
I read a story about how the Bush administration is monitoring phone calls and reporters

[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:26.460]
and a reporter calls me on the phone to get information on my confidential sources.

[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:27.880]
Anybody see a pattern here?

[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:32.040]
Next I get both a phone call and an email from David Armstrong of the National Security

[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:36.160]
News Service saying he's working with 60 minutes on the story about domestic spying by

[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:36.680]
the NSA.

[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:38.320]
He wants to info on my sources.

[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:42.860]
Let's see, a reporter uses both the telephone and email to request the names of confidential

[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:47.860]
sources on a story about how the NSA monitors telephone email use of you guessed it reporters.

[00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:51.940]
Sorry guys, I'm not about to burn my sources when you take so little precautions seeking

[00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:55.600]
information from me besides I wouldn't help 60 minutes if they were the only news outlet

[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:56.800]
left on the face of the planet.

[00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:01.860]
In 1981 I served on a panel discussion with Fred Graham, then legal correspondent for CVS

[00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:02.120]
News.

[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:06.040]
During a break I told him about a paper I once worked for, the Alton Telegraph in Illinois,

[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:09.000]
which had lost a landmark liable suit for something they never published.

[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:11.400]
I thought it might make a good story about injustice.

[00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:15.640]
Instead Graham turned the story over to Morley, Safer and 60 minutes and they put together

[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:19.320]
a hatched job on the newspaper and told the story from a trial or his point of view.

[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:23.240]
Instead of defending freedom of the press, Safer and his crew sensationalized the story

[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:23.680]
for ratings.

[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:28.120]
Some years later we learn again just how 60 minutes and CVS News hangs people off to

[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:28.400]
dry.

[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:32.940]
Jeffrey Wigan, the fired corporate vice president for Brown and Williamson tobacco company,

[00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:36.020]
blew the whistle on the company's campaign to hide the two dangers of nicotine.

[00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:40.100]
But 60 minutes and microwallers caved into corporate pressure and shoved the story after

[00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:41.240]
remaining Wigan's identity.

[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:43.780]
His reputation was ruined by the network's incompetence.

[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:47.740]
Given such track records, why should anyone, any source trust the mainstreamers?

[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:51.980]
The Washington Post sends an unsecure email openly asking me to violate federal law by

[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:55.200]
turning over a classified document and I'm supposed to believe they'll protect sources

[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.220]
that I've cultivated and protected for more than two decades.

[00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:01.480]
When Mark felt the number two man in the FBI served as post reporter, Bob Woodward's

[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:05.540]
primary source on Watergate insisted that Woodward avoid contact by telephone and divide

[00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:09.400]
the scheme of planted messages in the newspaper, left the Woodward's door and meetings in an

[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:10.660]
underground garage in Arlington.

[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:14.280]
Felt in the using the phone or other standard communications means of the time would

[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:17.160]
lead the security of Cessnaix and White House right through his door.

[00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:19.980]
Felt's identity remained a secret for 31 years.

[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:23.380]
My sources know better than to use phone lines and email to contact me.

[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:26.360]
We've worked out elaborate, always changing methods for sharing information.

[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:29.540]
I'm not about to risk the confidentiality with the reporters who are less careful.

[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:33.200]
I've been hauled in front of grand juries by overzealous prosecutors who wanted names

[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:33.600]
and sources.

[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:34.620]
They didn't get them.

[00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:38.740]
As a journalist, I was trained to develop my own network of sources, not call other reporters

[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:39.820]
and ask them to give up theirs.

[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.700]
Maybe I'm too old-fashioned for these pop culture journalism.

[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:46.000]
Maybe it's out of style for reporters to do their own legwork and research instead of

[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.060]
depending on Google and others to do it for them.

[00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:51.600]
Maybe I'm just too old to change and too damn suspicious to get trapped by youngsters.

[00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:53.560]
My mama drowned the dumb ones.

[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:56.380]
I love that.

[00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:59.300]
My mama drowned the dumb ones.

[00:39:59.520 --> 00:39:59.760]
Beauty.

[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:01.080]
Does he grade or what?

[00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:02.960]
He didn't even like that website once upon a time.

[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:04.320]
Pretty keep saying that.

[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.240]
I don't know, just for help.

[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:06.080]
Regulations.

[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:07.840]
Here's our poll so far.

[00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:11.040]
A TV show passed a present that you loved but would never admit to it.

[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:12.600]
555 votes.

[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:13.440]
But look at that.

[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:13.920]
Look at that.

[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:15.080]
Number 555.

[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:15.880]
That's almost.

[00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:17.120]
He hauls 76.

[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:18.620]
I hate this poll 71.

[00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:19.940]
I told you, go right to the top.

[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:20.940]
We're the labor.

[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:23.800]
A Batman 47.

[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:24.920]
Andy Griffins, your 40.

[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.120]
Flip her 35.

[00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:27.600]
Flip your magic triangle, Sandy.

[00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:29.600]
But a Brady runs 34.

[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:30.740]
In the real world, 29.

[00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:32.040]
Any soap opera, 29.

[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.580]
Gomer Piles, 29.

[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.320]
The Partridge family, 24.

[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:37.460]
I wonder if the guy with the eyes voted yet.

[00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:39.520]
Best for the Housewives, 22.

[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:41.060]
Joe McGinnor, 16.

[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:42.440]
Quiris Fulk, 15.

[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:43.400]
Like David Cassidy.

[00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:44.620]
Party of 5, 10.

[00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:45.540]
Like Scott Wolf.

[00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:46.760]
Dr. Phil, 10.

[00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:48.000]
Oh, God, the way he had him.

[00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:48.760]
Twin Peaks, 9.

[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:50.040]
The Arrally Factor, 9.

[00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:50.900]
I sure wouldn't admit that.

[00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:51.840]
And I don't watch it.

[00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:54.860]
And, man, you know, one thing that nobody wants to comment about,

[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:59.520]
and even a little Tommy Jekka has written is the fact that he still got shares in the

[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:01.340]
Vagan Broward on his radio show, O'Reilly.

[00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:02.720]
He is the no factor.

[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:05.660]
LN8, Garcetto 7, Oprah 7.

[00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:06.780]
Are you hot six?

[00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:09.760]
No wonder it went off after we found out who was the second.

[00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:13.580]
The apprentice six, Goldie Girls 4, Roll Rules 4, making the band four.

[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:16.540]
That was like a O-town and no town and Motown.

[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:17.400]
Remember O-town?

[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:18.960]
Yeah, I'll try to forget.

[00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:19.920]
How many minutes were there around?

[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:23.940]
The Areated Crosby Show 4, in Time Tumlin, they wouldn't have gotten any yet.

[00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:25.420]
So you guys have called them in.

[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:26.600]
You better hop on it.

[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:28.340]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:30.140]
36 minutes away.

[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:30.760]
But who's counting?

[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:31.300]
We're counting.

[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:32.700]
36 minutes away from that.

[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:34.200]
Who we came, free game show with the beast.

[00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:34.940]
All right.

[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:36.460]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:38.580]
Hey, can I put my favorite show on the pole?

[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:39.280]
Yes, sir.

[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:40.960]
Your favorite show, that's the go ahead.

[00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:41.800]
Bonanza.

[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:43.480]
Yeah, why wouldn't you want to admit that?

[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:44.380]
I know.

[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:45.000]
Got a gay.

[00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:47.320]
Good, yeah, what's kind of gay with that hot sing?

[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:49.960]
Put it on there.

[00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:50.520]
Bonanza.

[00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:52.140]
It's the best these guys can do.

[00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:53.340]
OK, we're all kind of gay.

[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:53.700]
Yeah.

[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:56.860]
I think Lauren Green was doing something with Alpo.

[00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:58.720]
Can you picture that?

[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:00.120]
I want to learn that too.

[00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:02.120]
Talk about going to the dogs.

[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.460]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:04.960]
Yeah, hi.

[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:05.860]
I got one for you.

[00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:08.960]
How about my favorite Martian, but I want to admit to it.

[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:09.320]
OK.

[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:10.680]

[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:13.000]
Ha, ha, ha.

[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:14.560]
Ha, ha, ha.

[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:15.960]
Yeah, that was kind of gay.

[00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:16.820]
Yeah, if you ask me.

[00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:18.140]
Those two guys living together.

[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:18.760]
That's right.

[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:19.620]
Well, it was his uncle.

[00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:20.560]
Well, they always say that.

[00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:20.740]
Right.

[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.160]
And this is Kiss and Cousin and Riz Uncle.

[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:23.240]
They're both dead now.

[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:24.740]
And Ted, I kept coming out of his head.

[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:25.400]
They're both dead.

[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:27.420]
Ray Walson was Uncle Whatever's name.

[00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:28.740]
Was Uncle Martian Martin?

[00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:30.580]
And who's the other guy, Bill Bixby?

[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:30.900]
Right.

[00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:32.300]
Who was also the incredible Hulk.

[00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:32.840]
That is correct.

[00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:33.880]
Well, what a shame.

[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:35.660]
You know, the good people, they die.

[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:36.960]
That's why I'm going to look to 100,

[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:39.460]
because I'm a miserable bastard, but that's hard to do.

[00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:39.820]
Good people.

[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:40.480]
That's not very young.

[00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:42.860]
I guess we didn't have to worry about that at 2 a.m.

[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:44.640]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.480]
Oh, now we got to recognize people.

[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:47.740]
There I can't think of any at the moment.

[00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:48.980]
We got some real fine people.

[00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:53.100]
Like Joe Bell, he's a great land-handed, grandstanded guy.

[00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:56.380]
And of course, then there's always Jim Sarni at the Sun

[00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:58.520]
Sentinel who can't write any article without mentioning

[00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:01.020]
that 760 ESPN radio and Palm Beach.

[00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:03.020]
That nobody listens to Jim.

[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:03.820]
I'm awfully sorry.

[00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:04.640]
And Evan Cohen.

[00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:06.320]
Oh, and by the way, his brother, Marty Cohen,

[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:07.780]
is going to be on, I think, doing 2 to 4.

[00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:09.700]
Let me look at that schedule next we can see.

[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:11.380]
We got that straight down there.

[00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:11.820]
Yeah.

[00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:15.240]
Bow and bow and gully and, oh boy.

[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:17.300]
Talk about dragging your feet, Joe.

[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:19.260]
That 2 to 4, Moe slot.

[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:20.580]
I say bring Moe back.

[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:22.580]
I've used it for a couple of the ups in a point one

[00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:24.180]
share or whatever it was, from 1.0.

[00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:24.860]
Absolutely.

[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:25.600]
Yeah.

[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:27.580]
I don't see nothing funny about what's

[00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:28.920]
going on between 2 and 4 right now.

[00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:30.460]
I think it's at any rate.

[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:32.300]
Just keep your opinions to yourself, smart ass.

[00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:32.660]
OK.

[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:35.700]
When you're shopping for shoes, what name immediately?

[00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:37.520]
Top's right in your brain, Brandy's.

[00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:38.580]
Of course, because I've been sticking

[00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:39.920]

Forrest Shime.

[00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:50.840]
Echo.

The pros at Brandy's even specialized in wide wits as well,

[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:04.920]
if he got those big fat feet.

[00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:08.080]
Or he just an old codger like me, because your feet get wider

[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:11.320]
and wider, like an any circuiting web when he gets to be real old.

[00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:13.880]
Brandy's worth a trip to New Just about anywhere in town.

[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:16.080]

[00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:40.300]
No.

[00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:48.660]
No.

[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:13.600]
Who could do it today?

[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:15.960]
Exactly. I couldn't say about it myself.

[00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:19.820]
Level 03 at 560 WQM were just 27 minutes away from the pre-game.

[00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:23.980]
The Hurricane pre-game warm-up show in the hurricanes in Duke at noon.

[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:26.640]
The ACC attorney in Greensboro, North Carolina.

[00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:28.280]
Wait till you hear this story.

[00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:31.800]
Doctor for Cuban World Baseball Classic is the son of somebody very famous.

[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:32.820]
Guess who the son of you is.

[00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:33.340]
The bells?

[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:34.300]
There you go.

[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:34.740]
All right.

[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:39.000]
The Doctor for Cuba's World Baseball Classic squad is no ordinary team physician.

[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:41.520]
Before last night, 11 to 2 victory over the Netherlands.

[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:47.980]
There was Antonio Castro Soder de Valier, 37 signing baseballs in team Cuba Caps for

[00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:50.760]
fans at Hiram, Bithor and Stadium in San Juan.

[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:54.620]
After Cuba's designated hitter slam to two and a home on the fourth inning, there was

[00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:57.700]
Castro with the rest of the team outside the heavily guarded dugout to congratulate

[00:46:57.700 --> 00:46:58.880]
Yuan De Garoble.

[00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:02.800]
This team physician was a former third baseman at the University of Habana.

[00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:05.680]
A decent player according to a big league scout who was coached.

[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:09.600]
He's also the son of team Cuba's most prominent fan, President Fidel Castro.

[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:10.080]
He's great.

[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:11.520]
You like them apples, huh?

[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.420]
I bet you a lot of people in a little of Antarctica would be doing a green apple

[00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:15.840]
crick-stuff when they find out about that.

[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:18.640]
Not many team doctors are seen signing autographs.

[00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:20.820]
Catcher was told on the field while the team warmed up nearby.

[00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:21.940]
He just chuckled.

[00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:25.880]
On the doctor for an Olympic championship team, he said, I guess that makes me famous.

[00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:30.580]
The Cuban's winners of the 2004 Olympic gold medal in 2005 World Cup play Puerto Rico

[00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:34.420]
tonight in a highly talented contest between pool seas only on the field of teams.

[00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:35.540]
But I'll be put to boot for the ball.

[00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:37.640]
Is that he is Fidel, the team doctor?

[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:40.000]
I trust that guy or what?

[00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:41.360]
No, I'm like I did run.

[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:43.460]
Nobody's slipping in their oval team.

[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:44.880]
I'll trust the doctor to speak, A.

[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:45.000]
What?

[00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:52.480]
New York Times today says Abrum office spending has been detailed $20,000 for a car monitor.

[00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:56.440]
When the money was rolling in, Jack Abrum office certainly knew how to spend it.

[00:47:56.560 --> 00:48:00.560]
During his hideous want to watch since top lobbyists, Abrum off-rate $1,000,000 and faded

[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.960]
a lot of make his momentaries at his pencil in the evidence restaurant.

[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:09.300]
But one of his most conspicuous indulgences was his fully loaded 2002 BMW The New York Times

[00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:10.100]

[00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:16.680]

[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:20.920]
office for Abrum off who had one time imploded driver for it so it could indulge in heavy workload.

[00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:26.100]
Invoices offer a look inside the tinted windows, a $450 edition that was the cheapest part

[00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:26.540]
of the job.

[00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:32.600]
He spent 20 grand for a custom built 15.2 inch wide screen and manual foot down video

[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:32.920]
monitor.

[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:37.480]

For $7,390 more he added a hands-free cell phone system with a special 910 amplifier

[00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:48.500]
to boost the signal and a docking station where his laptop built into the back of the

[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:49.100]
right front seat.

[00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:52.180]
He also paid $6,500 for seat back tables.

[00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:54.260]
All right.

[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:57.800]
He knew how to live it up baby and he's never going to live it down.

[00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:01.140]
Oh, you just wait the list of keeps coming out.

[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:03.600]
He just seemed a little teeny tiny trickle.

[00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:08.240]
Speaking of trickling, maybe from drinking too much of that Jesus juice, Michael Jackson

[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:10.520]
find over Neverland labor miscues.

[00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:14.920]
Soared on the news, California officials have found Michael Jackson nearly 170 grand

[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:19.580]
ordered employees at the pop stars Neverland Ranch to stop working after finding that

[00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:23.500]
employees had been paid since December and the ranch's workers compensation coverage

[00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:24.420]
had been allowed to lapse.

[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.560]
That sounds like the way to beastly do business.

[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:32.160]
On Thursday yesterday, the California Department of Industrial Relations left the stop order

[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:35.560]
on Neverland, which provokes employees from going back to work until workers, companies

[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:39.440]
restored and also find Jackson 69,000 for the laughs.

[00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:43.200]
On Tuesday, the same agency said, learning to manage the tax and pay employees at least

[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:48.280]
36,000 back wages by next week, as well as a fine of more than $100,000 of payment to

[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:48.720]
pay wages.

[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:49.740]
Oh, we're fine.

[00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:53.160]
The back wages and penalties aren't paid by March 14th, the Department will pursue appropriate

[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:53.760]
legal action.

[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:55.600]
Jackson, the course hasn't been living in Neverland.

[00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:58.040]
We spent months early after he was acquitted on child model station charges.

[00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:02.700]
He relocated to Bahrain, a small nation in the Persian Gulf and is slumping around in

[00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:05.680]
his burqa, looking fashionably gay.

[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:07.240]
And also using the ladies' room.

[00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:08.380]
Did we ever have that story on?

[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:08.980]
I don't think so.

[00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:10.940]
There was a story about how he was using the ladies' room.

[00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:11.500]
Right.

[00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:12.340]
I heard it.

[00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:13.120]
I don't know if he was his burqa.

[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:15.820]
If you had a burqa on, I guess you don't go into men's room.

[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.200]
You'll get shot at, I don't know.

[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:20.660]
He says, courtship of Eddie's father, but don't tell anybody I liked it.

[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:21.840]
All right.

[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:23.620]
Father, wasn't that also Bill Bispy as it was?

[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:25.240]
I'm sure you planted the seed.

[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:25.900]
I see.

[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:26.660]
Seed.

[00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:30.260]
Brian and Pompato Bicez, American Idol.

[00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:31.160]
Are we spelled wrong?

[00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:32.380]
Well, that's Josh for you.

[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:33.840]
Let's see how he spelled Martian.

[00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:37.980]
Oh, no.

[00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:38.940]
Woo.

[00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:40.480]
American Idol, you got it.

[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:41.160]
We got it.

[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:42.360]
I think he can have it.

[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:43.620]
Now it's not spelled IDLE.

[00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:46.820]
Look how Josh courtes spelled Martian.

[00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:49.840]
M-A-R-S-H-I-N.

[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.640]
Isn't that what you do when you go out and hunt in the marsh?

[00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:53.220]
That's right.

[00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:54.120]
It's Martian.

[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:55.940]
I'm going to stop it really.

[00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:00.300]
I'm going to stop it in the marsh.

[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:03.420]
I'm sure Eric will correct that to cover up the embarrassment factor.

[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:08.580]
Speaking of Josh, he's going to be with the mad dog today, 4-7 at Konains Grill, 51-81

[00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:09.380]
Sheridan Street in Hollywood.

[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:13.200]
4-7 Josh will have a merchandise there and he's got to raise 200 bucks for us today.

[00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:14.180]
Right?

[00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:14.760]
That's right.

[00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:16.040]
All you need is to come out.

[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:16.580]
Right.

[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:18.040]
All you Martians, that's right.

[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:21.360]
In fact, maybe 7 of Martians that were stuck in most pants, maybe they'll show up.

[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:22.680]
And Eltonates and Cash.

[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:27.120]
And then George tomorrow, 3-5 PM with Dolphin Stadium for the Maroonie Auto Ten Sale,

[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:28.080]
3-5 Marathon.

[00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:31.040]
With our CDs, we're going to have T-shirts, 20 bucks of peace.

[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:31.360]
Come on.

[00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:32.260]
Cut loose with some cash.

[00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:36.940]
We get almost 15 grand, but boy, this thing is slowed down to a crawl to like a teeny-tiny

[00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:37.320]
crawl.

[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:39.980]
It's 11.09 a.k.w. and we only got 21 minutes.

[00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:41.080]
We've got to talk real fast.

[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:43.340]
Beach Ford has gone mad, since in case you missed it.

[00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:45.620]
It's madness in March all this month at Beach Ford.

[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:48.740]
They dismissed having a record month last month so they planned a break that record this

[00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:49.060]
month.

[00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:53.820]
Right now, extended cam Ford 150s are as low as $249 a month.

[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:55.140]
So I said dollars at time.

[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:58.860]
With $995 down plus fees for the poor credit and through nine month lease.

[00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:00.860]
So if you say bucks, you can get in big trouble.

[00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:04.680]
Magnus in March at Beach Ford means you must be mad if you don't take advantage of rebates

[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:08.420]
and discounts of up to $10,000 on all new and used vehicles.

[00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:11.700]
If you're not in the market for a new car being or somebody who is, be sure and send

[00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:14.480]
their ass in to Beach Ford because if they take the liberty this month during March,

[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:16.960]
Beach Ford will hand you over to a hundred bucks in cash.

[00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:20.260]
And when it comes from Beach Ford's advertising budget, so won't you check up your friends

[00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:22.100]
price back a couple hundred bucks at all.

[00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:23.600]
Don't miss out on this once a year of ed.

[00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:24.140]
It's Beach Ford.

[00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:26.060]
Madness in March going on right now.

[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:30.360]
Extended cam Ford F-150s is lowest $249 a month.

[00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:35.820]
This case and counts and rebates up to $10 grand and $200 just for referring to a friend.

[00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:36.740]
What's not to like?

[00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:41.240]
Hurry on in Beach Ford and you'll find two miles east of the Golden Glades on 163rd Street

[00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:42.180]
at West Dixie Highway.

[00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:44.600]
Guarantea, I'll bet you Maddie Bell's life on it.

[00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:46.420]
You will love your Beach Ford experience.

[00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:48.940]
This is Neil Rogers.

[00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:52.820]
This is 5.16 QA.

[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:55.860]
5.25.

[00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:58.740]
You should be called to invite.

[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:02.120]
5.25.

[00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:05.400]
You should invite to win the debt of a sky.

[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:11.660]
Oh yes, who may invest but who to have his way?

[00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:13.440]
Who will you invite?

[00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:14.900]
Who will you make?

[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:16.220]
Who died?

[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:20.860]
Who will be pretty mad?

[00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:24.240]
What's the good old time?

[00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:29.680]
With the bush-dryer, travelling home?

[00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:39.660]
I ask you what would be safer than an unletch-rainer with a suitcase.

[00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:42.060]
I am a Ford.

[00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:48.140]
You will fight to fight for the future.

[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:50.420]
You will start for a Ford.

[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:56.880]
And when you die, get a free pass of Ford.

[00:53:57.740 --> 00:53:58.340]
You die.

[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:01.580]
You don't get to have a single farm.

[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:07.500]
Next Lord, or Dubai, we will make new guys.

[00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:14.680]
Thank you for your money, never.

[00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:21.660]
Where we now control all the other highs.

[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:28.600]
Cash, whatever we were given to the hearts of two hate women.

[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:33.240]
A fair share of these guys.

[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:36.040]
Do do do do do do do do do do do do.

[00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:41.160]
We'll change your time, cash, and all the green hearts.

[00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:46.940]
You'll buy the hearts of the old days.

[00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:51.600]
They do do for the future.

[00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:57.140]
But we won't let you know to fight who you will make.

[00:54:57.780 --> 00:54:59.240]
You can't-

[00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:01.320]
I'm dying over here.

[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:02.720]
Let's listen to better talk fast.

[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:03.760]
We only got 14 minutes.

[00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:06.980]
TV show pastor present you love but would never admit to it.

[00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:09.660]
I hate this pull 94.

[00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:10.900]
Pull it away.

[00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:11.540]
We hate it.

[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:12.680]
We hate you too.

[00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:16.940]
He-ha 82, Batman 48, and your Griffiths show 42.

[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:19.420]
Flipper 37, Flipper.

[00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:20.660]
Flip it again, Sandy.

[00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:21.140]
Come on.

[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:25.020]
Greaty bunch 36, any soap opera 33, the real world 31,

[00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:28.660]
Gomers Piles 31, the cartridge family 25 with any Bonanoushi.

[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:32.280]
This but housewives 22, queer as folk 16,

[00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:36.820]
dual millionaire 16, Gourmet girls 14, party of 5, 12, Dr. Phil 12,

[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:40.540]
Quint Peaks 10, the Arighty Factor 9, Ellen 9,

[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:44.580]
Dark Shadow 7, the apprentice 7, Oprah 7, are you hot six?

[00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:49.080]
Read a crossby show 5, Road Rules 4, making the band 4, my favorite Martian.

[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:49.840]
Spelled right.

[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:51.840]
Thank you, Eric, for bailing out the goofball.

[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:54.040]
My favorite Martian won, but Anza won, time 101,

[00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:57.460]
and the Walton so far has got the big, oh, because the John Boy is it.

[00:55:58.260 --> 00:55:58.980]
What are the big moles?

[00:55:59.200 --> 00:55:59.660]
Do you think it now?

[00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:02.180]
Who had the biggest mole, Peggy Lee and Riki or a John Boy?

[00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:04.000]
Oh, and Riki, before he had it, tell you.

[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:05.260]
The biggest mole, right?

[00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:07.400]
It's not what Greg Read was always running around, who's the mole?

[00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:09.460]
And then come to find out who's him.

[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:12.340]
He was the one feeding Barry Jackass all the information all the time.

[00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:13.300]
The inside poop.

[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:14.420]
He had mole and oma.

[00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:15.000]
Yeah.

[00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:17.660]
The US military will close Abu Gharr,

[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:22.400]
prison probably within three months, and transfer some 4,500 sluppers to other jails in Iraq.

[00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:25.600]
A military spokesman said yesterday, the prison in Western Baghdad,

[00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:29.440]
was a torture set of what Anza was saying before photographs of American soldiers

[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:34.700]
abusing Iraqis there in 2003, gave it a new notoriety, and made it a touchstone for the Arab street.

[00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:39.340]
We will transfer operations from Abu Gharr, to the new camp, Kropper.

[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:43.160]
Is that spelled with an O or an A?

[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:44.040]
Camp Kropper.

[00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:48.480]
Once constraints completed there, Lieutenant Colonel Kierkeven Curry told reporters.

[00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:50.140]
Kid Curry.

[00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:51.680]
Well, he got to do something nowadays.

[00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:53.360]
He sure made it over there at 0.96.

[00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:56.320]
Had a big flush there at the QA man.

[00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:57.520]
Beesley's had a big flush.

[00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:01.400]
Oh, and speaking of flush, a Georgia man has filed a lawsuit against Wal-Martin,

[00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:06.020]
federal district court in Atlanta, in a fight over his t-shirts that compare the retailer's business

[00:57:06.020 --> 00:57:07.600]
to the Holocaust.

[00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:10.520]
Charles Smith has been marketing shirts that read,

[00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:13.100]
I, Hart, Walla Cost t-shirts.

[00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:14.040]
Okay.

[00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:14.300]
Thank you.

[00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:15.780]
I love Walla Cost.

[00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:19.200]
Wal-Mart filed a season to assist or an attempt to make him stop printing the shirts.

[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:22.100]
The company said Smith is engaging in trademark infringement.

[00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:25.540]
It is threatened to sue Smith that he continues to display the logos on his website

[00:57:25.540 --> 00:57:26.900]
and to print them on his products.

[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:29.860]
Well, I didn't realize that they had a Walla Cost spin-off.

[00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:32.600]
Before the eight-year-old Smith is a computer repairman,

[00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:36.480]
said he has no deep connection to the company, but he claims using the logos as a free speech issue.

[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:38.260]
I remember only used to have that in America.

[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:39.040]
Do you?

[00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:40.740]
Smith said he came up with his long time ago.

[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:44.160]
He came up with his anti-Wall-Mart logo after conversations with a customer and employee

[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:46.720]
both had bad experiences with Walmart.

[00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:51.740]
He designed his first logo in July, one shirt with Walla Cost printed above an eagle in the smiley face

[00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:54.500]
sold on November 16th and it had smith $5.10.

[00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:55.920]
It's not like how we're doing.

[00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:59.220]
He said if the court sides with him had used any profits to pay his legal fees

[00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:00.820]
and for continued production of the products.

[00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:05.440]
Walmart spokeswoman Sarah Clark said Smith is infringing on the company's trademark,

[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:10.060]
also making an offensive association between Walmart and one of the greatest tragedies of the past century.

[00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:11.920]
You go, baby, whatever his name is.

[00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:12.700]
What's his name?

[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:13.500]
Charlie.

[00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:14.400]
You go Chuck.

[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:18.960]
Now I found a product and I wouldn't say I found a product, I found the story about it.

[00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:20.900]
And you seem to be aware of it, which rocks me.

[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:22.300]
And this Shira Taki.

[00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:24.900]
Yeah, well, I have this Japanese connection, you know.

[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:25.860]
Well, that's right.

[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.820]
Your daughter probably brought home a pound of Shira Taki which I'm going to have had,

[00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:29.580]
but she didn't.

[00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:31.520]
From Nagasaki Shira home Shira Taki.

[00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:32.680]
She brought a whole lot of debt.

[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:37.040]
Oh, when Mark Olmira and his wife quit smoking last year,

[00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:38.680]
he experienced an all-too-common problem,

[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:40.520]
he gained weight 35 pounds to be exact.

[00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:44.080]
And so Olmira, a 46-year-old computer programmer, and his wife Char,

[00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:47.300]
found to get back in shape by following the Weight Watchers plan.

[00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:50.600]
But there was a rink of the Olmira's who live in a small village called Lake Inhales, Illinois,

[00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:55.140]
adored pasta and sat down to big bowls of spaghetti two or three nights a week.

[00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:59.260]
But the high carb calorie dense food was off limits to the Olmira's if they wanted to shed pounds.

[00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:00.340]
Oh, what a shame.

[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:04.300]
Now, here's the exciting news for me, a pasta lover who can't eat any of this.

[00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:05.740]
It's my favorite food in the world, man.

[00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:06.540]
Can't eat it.

[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:10.200]
So when Mark Olmira discovered a milky white gelatinous Japanese noodle

[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:13.900]
with only 20 calories of serving called Shira Taki who was thrilled,

[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:17.620]
got a great line I could use in this story, but I guess I better not get joist.

[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:18.020]
Right.

[00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:20.040]
Olmira has to do that last paragraph.

[00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:23.720]
Olmira was browsing through your diet magazine when he read that Shira Taki made

[00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:26.280]
from a Yam-like Japanese root called Kaniyaku.

[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:28.240]
It's something of a miracle food.

[00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:29.140]
It's a miracle.

[00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:30.040]
Oh, my God.

[00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:30.760]
I don't like that.

[00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:33.120]
Shira Taki has no fat and few carbs.

[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:38.560]
It's got like, I looked on one of the brands on the internet and it had like three grams of

[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:38.740]
carbon.

[00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:41.680]
If I could, it's got zero usable carbs or what are net carbs.

[00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:46.700]
And a mere 20 calories of serving compared with an average of 200 for a fetishini or ziti.

[00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:49.600]
To the Olmira is the pale chewy noodle with a diet as holy grail.

[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:51.680]
See, now you can get some of that low carb pasta sauce.

[00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:55.680]
And you should mirror a bunch of this stuff and like putting on meatballs and your sausages

[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:56.840]
and a little bit of wine.

[00:59:56.840 --> 01:00:00.840]
We both just got a big grin in our faces with the first mob full Marko Miro recalls.

[01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:02.400]
That's of this stuff.

[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:05.720]
Now they count themselves among a growing group of Shira Taki obsessed dieters.

[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:07.240]
I think we got something here.

[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:08.060]
I think we're onto it.

[01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:10.460]
Shira Taki, the longest staple in Japan has become.

[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:12.900]
You'll see too many fat Japanese except those sumo guys.

[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:13.420]
That's right.

[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:15.340]
They have to go to efforts for that.

[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:17.160]
Phone a 5D diet food craze in the U.S.

[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:20.780]
The noodles are sold in large supermarket chains like whole food markets as well as in small.

[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:23.120]
Specialized health food stores across the country.

[01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:25.200]
Recently, publics is required about carrying it.

[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:27.280]
Oh, please throw you a fat folks.

[01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:30.780]
I'll have no trouble finding it here because there's a Japanese and Chinese.

[01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:33.500]
There's an Asian supermarket in every other street corner.

[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:39.360]
A coin of manufacturer is rising Shira Taki sales are linked to dieters incorporating the low-cal noodles and the weight loss plans.

[01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:43.140]
The leading U.S. manufacturer, House Foods American Corp and Garden Grove, California,

[01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:46.360]
which holds and has sold Shira Taki since September 2002.

[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:49.020]
Says sales are attracted more than triple from last year.

[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:53.500]
The house foods brands also been in top several Amazon.com's gourmet food selection,

[01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:58.680]
where it's listed as Fedachini-shaped tofu because the brand incorporates a blend of tofu and kaniyaku.

[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:01.000]
How do you like that? In fact, they're having a hard time.

[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:01.480]
I don't know yet.

[01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:01.920]
Oh, you've been up with it.

[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:02.960]
That's sensational.

[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:06.240]
So if you want to lose some weight, Shira Taki is the waiter, I guess.

[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:07.180]
I'm going to get some.

[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:08.520]

This is Neil Rogers.

[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:16.340]
This is 516 QAAC.

[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:20.420]
That's it. It's all they wrote.

[01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:26.160]
They will get the rest kicked by juice today, but thanks very, very much to them for winning yesterday,

All right.

[01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:31.280]
I'm going to smear it.

Let me know how it goes.

[01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:33.860]
Huh?

Let me know how it tastes.

It's tasteless like this show.

[01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:39.460]
Yeah, let's get it said.

[01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:40.280]
