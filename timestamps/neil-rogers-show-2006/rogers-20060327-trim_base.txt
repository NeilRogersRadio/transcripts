[00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.500]
Tommy Tommy whose voice we just heard Tommy you know production time. Oh yeah he

[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:15.320]
farted who farted that shot. So for our poll today might get your input since

[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.460]
you're the maven when there's that echo again boy this is getting really

[00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.400]
over that's thinking as echo anyway who is the greatest baseball player of all

[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.560]
time the reason I took the poll is because Josh Cordis continues to insist that

[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.760]
very bonds is the greatest player of all time which I find most amusing and so

[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.360]
much of the audience so far we got about almost 500 votes and he's near the

[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.200]
bottom I thought Willie Mays was the best player I saw well so far he's

[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.800]
through we got Babe Ruth actually second I never saw Babe Ruth yeah you did as a

[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.400]
child no never saw him come over Babe Ruth 1948 when he had the lung cancer oh

[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.760]
yeah but he wasn't playing then no he wasn't playing too well yeah that's

[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.900]
another point how can how can punks you don't even know who these other people are

[00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.140]
can they make a judgment I saw Ty Cobb I saw Christy Matyson where in my

[00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.720]
dreams yeah Ted Williams Hank Aaron Mickey Mandel Pete Rose Joe Demazio they're

[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.680]
all above very bonds Lou Gehrig is below him which I find very demeaning and

[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.440]
that's because they don't know Lou Gehrig well Lou Gehrig probably wasn't as

[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.400]
great an all-around player as bonds hmm bonds was a terrific field at two when

[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.780]
he was high-carb is a balloon and Roberto Clemente we just put on there he was

[00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.300]
great but I think it was yeah for bro Clemente was great yes he was he was

[00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.160]
he was a brideweezer but he was pretty good you used to follow the pirates

[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.440]
in you very religiously yeah Vernon Law the Deacon oh yeah Freddie Green

[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.920]
Elroy face Maz Dick Stewart Dr. Strange Glove Rocky Nelson Smokey Burgess

[00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.600]
Geosom Moli Bob Skinner Bill Hurden I mean keep going I could go with

[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.420]
and call the great Kent the Colvey's good big grote Don Hogue they don't how

[00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.980]

[00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.900]
really nasty it was money anything for a buck that's right anything for a

[00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.140]
buck you got that right now spirit no spirit no team spirit Rob Ross

[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.960]
this boom Bob now this crap about George Mason who cares I think it's great what

[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.220]
is George Mason anyway what is that what is it when I worked in Albee in

[00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.780]
Michigan W.A.L.M. in 1966 five my program director his real name was

[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.220]
Derwood Karin but is on the your name was George Paul Mason I worked for a guy

[00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.120]
named Glenn Mason that's about as far from Derwood Karin George Paul Mason and

[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.320]
the most the most he was a big fat old guy what a typical radio drift your kind

[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.760]
of guy you know and the thing I remember most is one day I'm playing the news

[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.720]
open and all of a sudden Derwood used to do the news he comes waddling down

[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.920]
the stairs and he had just been taking a big doose and the pulling his pants up

[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.700]
as he's coming down the stairs they go in and do the news it was he had a

[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.500]
seat to believe it I just did not have seen it yeah you're right nice pretty

[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.780]

my weekend was okay my was awful was it really well I was in far and I didn't

[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.520]
go gamble any money away I would I wouldn't gamble even believe it or not I

[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.640]
was in Florence Kentucky and I did the you know Lane's oh yeah like you you

[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.760]
get you when you open up the book in the hotel and it has a list of houses of

[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.500]
worship yeah and none of them have a bet something before it right yeah you know

[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:42.180]
you're in hostile territories I bet you didn't have a list of delis on it no no

[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.900]
but it wasn't just that it was I did the lanes and stakes and it was so cold

[00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.820]
there and snowy and just snowy yeah yeah in Florence Kentucky we haven't had a

[00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.100]
snow here in ages in fact this way spring is here double digits everything was

[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.140]
snow and the worst part not so much when you're doing the show but when you're

[00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.980]
out there rehearsing and you're standing around that's the worst fan I saw

[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.680]
yeah at least when you're doing the show it takes your mind off how cold you are

[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.200]
but anyway it's over with no that's good you won't have to be going back to

on the racing network and there's racing from Dubai was the yesterday Saturday

[00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.820]
Saturday Saturday morning I thought to myself what I'm ragheads man maybe it

[00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.740]
makes me very angry because they take it over basically the whole third

[00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.620]
but of course industry as you know because they got all the all the top

[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.640]
forces because they got the money our money yeah I didn't ran it ran me like

[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.940]
when we were fighting the Gulf War one I didn't go to that event all those big

[00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.700]
hot shots from Kuwait you know while we are our people over there fighting

[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.800]
leave the way I just having a good party today's herald editorial page

[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.760]
ragheads yes had letters to the editor written by four women and they sounded

[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.600]
identical like they were out of the same click you know that a Robert

[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.320]
Greeper goes throughout all the letters probably in a spare time like the

[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.860]
weapons of mass destruction disruption we keep saying that there were none but

[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.680]
they really were and that Saddam hid them in some place yeah well no you're

[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.100]
right Robert Greeper would have written that because he is a weapon of mass

[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.320]
destruction him and that entire programming department I'm telling you every

[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.300]
letter was written by the same person I'm sure of it right now what people

[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:06.100]
was this in today's heralded by the way your boy we had some mistakes in

[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:11.600]
his story about the marons my boy what was that a Barry oh Barry Jackass and

[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.380]
what would that would be a first he made a mistake made a couple like what

[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.280]
what we're gonna hear a little bit are you gonna get the choice again oh well

[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.880]
I'll take my chances and get them all from the beast that we're not supposed to

[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.960]
talk about the here I checked on that we're okay with that I see that was the

[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.040]
old sales manager put that out there because he thought they were gonna

[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.860]
advertise yeah they do advertise and it's a making a difference yeah a lot of

[00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.600]
tradeouts on here nice job there Chris he's doing it this new sales guy man he

[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:45.020]
is the best but anyway he wrote that the county was not going to was not gonna

[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.040]
put a ballot initiative out there for a stadium well if they got wrong about

[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.480]
that they're gonna be crazy to do that what's the difference if people vote don't

[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.800]
vote for it it's over with anyway yeah but anyway they are considering it the

[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.040]
second thing that he had there he wrote about how Major League Baseball could

[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.460]
have stepped up and contributed money to their stadium effort down here when

[00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.760]
they were so when they were only 30 or 40 million dollars apart you know what

[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.420]
he forgot Major League Baseball already gave him 30 million dollars when they

[00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:17.280]

same company that can't pay their bills on time and don't want to give a

[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:36.100]
race to a Josh Cortes or give Georgia new contract but they could go on borrow

[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:41.340]
17 million so they could buy KDWN news and talk in Las Vegas they already have

[00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:44.760]

other than that the racing is great they uh oh they that's why I was in that's

[00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:42.540]

[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:50.080]
tear-away park yeah he's a tracking answer I know he's the worst the worst in the

[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.200]
world I keep bringing that up only because I just can't believe that he can

[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.880]
keep a job anywhere just or horrendous I don't want to hear he's a nice guy

[00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.760]
he's just horrendous he's a very nice guy he's a terrible terrible I don't

[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:05.520]
disagree with you but he is the world's worst and he just an embarrassment he's

[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.060]
like a county fairer race announcer from the old harness tracks and a little

[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:14.800]
like in Sturgis Michigan someplace like that and there they go okay

[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:15.720]

they won last night that they're throw throw throw in them tell so if they're

[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.920]
not going to make it how are the Panthers who are now a point behind the

[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.060]

[00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:06.560]

anybody sing my dream yet

[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:15.980]
Autumn

[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:42.560]
Who's the scienceologist that turned out to be a hypocrite?

[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:44.240]
Stop!

[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:45.560]
Everything!

[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:51.020]
Who is the dude that gets nibbled and they put down some food?

[00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:52.380]
Stop!

[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:54.600]
Can you do it?

[00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:58.680]
Who's the cat that's making fun of every other religion?

[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:00.520]
Stop!

[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.500]
Not only.

[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.860]
This issue is one brainwash mother.

[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.120]
Shit, I'm not.

[00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:08.420]
I'm not about to share.

[00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:09.900]
Then we can do it.

[00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:12.920]
These are two things go hard.

[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.560]
But no one understands him, but I run hovers.

[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:17.320]
Yes.

[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.120]
He's doing an infomercial.

[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:28.880]
He's doing an infomercial.

[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:29.880]
I saw a hit to the 70s.

[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:34.100]
I saw it last night on the gambling channel.

[00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:37.080]
He's doing an infomercial.

[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.940]
That's how much of a sell-out he is.

[00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:39.860]
That's the case.

[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.840]
I'll screw him and Joyce.

[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.340]
Did you see that episode?

[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:44.440]
They played it over the weekend.

[00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:45.680]
A couple of times.

[00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:46.140]
What do you mean?

[00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:46.800]
I see it.

[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:47.840]
What did they kill them on?

[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:48.440]
Oh no.

[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.300]
It's one to see.

[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:51.180]
I'll be damned.

[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.900]
How many times have you been waiting for the re-run of the Out of the Closet?

[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:54.300]
You're free.

[00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:55.460]
I'm waiting for that.

[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:55.940]
Hold your breath.

[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:56.300]
I won it.

[00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:57.700]
10-13.

[00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:58.980]
Speaking of Closet case.

[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.440]
The American Revolution.

[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:01.920]
Oh, the American Revolution.

[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.340]
Here come the Indians are coming.

[00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:04.660]
And the British are coming.

[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:06.680]
You all know the name Dry Concepts.

[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.000]
I'm sure because I've been talking about them for over 21 years.

[00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:10.480]
That's how many years I've used them in my home.

[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.760]
In fact, they were in my house two weeks ago today.

[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.080]
And made my carpets look just like brand spanking.

[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.300]
And it's just like they'll do for you.

[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:20.060]
Before you go out and spend thousands of dollars to replace your carpeting no matter how hopeless

[00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:21.020]
they may look right now.

[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:22.540]
Give Dry Concepts a call.

[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.020]
Tell Troy Stratford sent you by.

[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.800]
They will absolutely pee in their pants laughing.

[00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:28.440]
And let Dry Concepts bring your carpets back to life.

[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.420]
When they finish with their fabulous job, they leave your carpets vibrant in color,

[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:33.660]
soft to the touch and stain-free.

[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.400]
Dry Concepts is the only company that I trust the only one you ought to be trusting too.

[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.200]
And just in case you weren't aware of it, I'm only going to do carpet cleaning.

[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:46.500]
And we also specialize in drapery cleaning, a polyestery cleaning, deep cleaning of your expensive leather furniture and much more too.

[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.340]
All of these...

[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:48.600]
Are you putting leather chairs?

[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:49.580]
Yes.

[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:50.780]
They might not have to.

[00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:54.760]
And that's right, they might have to clean the chair and their red token is asked out of the tea room

[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.080]
and let your children go in there and do an ace doose in a trace.

[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.200]
And pretty soon it's going to be a cattorce if you don't cut the crap.

[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:05.200]
I mean, without a doubt, one of the best things you can do for your Oriental or Aria Rugs is use a quality underlayment.

[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.120]
Maybe that's what you need is an underlayment right now.

[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.920]
Like a flying carpet underneath you or just in case.

[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:11.900]
Shower carpet.

[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:18.540]
It's essential for a stentied life and beauty of your Aria Rugs and a quality underlayment provides critical cushioning and prevents skidding and hard floors.

[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:21.080]
Oh yeah, you might skid right down the hallway right to the tea room.

[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:26.580]
During this month, during March, kid 15% in savings on all underlayment padding from drapery concepts.

[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.040]
As you know by now, I hope.

[00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:34.340]
Always professional, always on time and always give you a written guaranteed price upfront before they do their fabulous unbeatable job.

[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:39.960]
Carp reclaining water damage restoration petal or treatments, mattress cleanly gets sicker by those dust mites and lots more.

[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.460]
Call the best and trust the best.

[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.920]
Dry concepts call them tool free.

[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:49.440]
And they brought the Palm Beaches and tell them that twice strat for a toy did you call 1-800-248-5071.

[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:54.340]
That's 1-800-248-5071 around the web, dryconcepts.com.

[00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.320]
This is Neal Rogers.

[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.480]
This is 560-Q-A-B.

[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.240]
Neal Rogers.

[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:08.260]
Hey, hey, it's bad. I'm murder.

[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:15.680]
This is Bill Kiles becoming an actual music and fun, and fire operas gonna be wearing girls clothes before it's all done.

[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.360]
Hey, the fiber, Alberta.

[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.480]
Wilder, are you but wearing up a dress?

[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.320]
It worked for my Lawrence and Tyler Perry, so I'm gonna dress the same way.

[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:28.520]
Hey, hey, hey.

[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.440]
Hey, look, here comes Weird Harry.

[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.460]
Why are you calling me with that, Albert?

[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.660]
You don't want wearing high heels, and you got right, Luffy.

[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:39.280]
That's right, that Albert is like school on Thanksgiving.

[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:40.620]
School on Thanksgiving?

[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.060]
Uh-huh, no class.

[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:45.800]
World is what we learned today.

[00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:50.240]
You see, if you are an African-American comedian,

[00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:52.460]
and you want a number one movie,

[00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:54.660]
you've got to press up like a woman.

[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.880]
And that's the real drag.

[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:57.720]

[00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.020]
It's an 19 at 560 WQM.

[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.620]
He's a real laprime, ain't he, huh?

[00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:02.960]
No.

[00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.180]
So, I just heard to make it back or what?

[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:07.100]
Make it back?

[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:07.980]
No, I never got into.

[00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:10.580]
I went in there during the break, and they had reloaded.

[00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:11.840]
Like, there's a whole new crowd in there.

[00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:12.240]
Reloaded?

[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:13.700]
Apparently, a line hit point.

[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:14.160]
No, a couple of round words.

[00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:15.020]
A little bit.

[00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:17.920]
Apparently, a line hit point, because Brett took forever to get out of there.

[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:21.380]
So, unlike number 42 now in the building, waiting to get in there.

[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.060]
George is going to take a number 42.

[00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:25.740]
That's how much I can't wait, too.

[00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:27.260]
I can't wait to see exactly what that consists of.

[00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:27.900]
Good Lord.

[00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:30.720]
I think I'm going to run down these little, these bad bits.

[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:33.040]
Pimp.

[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:42.200]
I guess it makes it funnier the fact that they're supposed to be sound bad, and the drop-ins

[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:42.540]
are like,

[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:46.800]
Pimp.

[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:49.240]
Pimp.

[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:49.740]

[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:50.560]
Pimp.

[00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:51.380]
Pimp.

[00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:57.240]
Oh, it's tough off there.

[00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:57.880]
It's tough off there for a Pimp.

[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.000]
Pimp.

[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:09.000]
Oh, man, those are great edits, anything?

[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:13.940]
Pimp.

[00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:22.160]
Those are like the quick edits we have to do with the buttons on the board.

[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.340]
You know, the joy set it's?

[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:30.000]
Pimp.

[00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:40.700]
Oh, could he build out an ounce of sound or what?

[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.160]
They're wringled.

[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:45.640]
Pimp.

[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.360]
You know what I mean?

[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.540]
Let me play that again.

[00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:48.940]
You know what I mean?

[00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:49.960]
It's the S from Star.

[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:53.780]
They did these purposely, so sloppy that it's.

[00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:57.100]
Pimp.

[00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.200]
Oh, my kind of edits.

[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:01.360]
Here you go, Joyce.

[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.140]
Take those and shove more to Mundo and show him.

[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:04.840]
Maybe they'll send her fat ass off the Vegas.

[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.600]
They lose her in the mountains somewhere.

[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:09.180]
21 past 10 at 5.60 WQM.

[00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.020]
Happy Monday to you.

[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:11.560]
Curtis Stevenson at 2 today.

[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:12.280]
There you go.

[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:13.400]
That makes some sense.

[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:15.800]
That's why he won't be back on tomorrow, because we got a ball game.

[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.860]
Mad Dog at the Triple A arena.

[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:19.400]
Now, what's that all about?

[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.520]
Are they he got a big game tonight or something, Josh?

[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:22.940]
Oh, they're all big games.

[00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:24.540]
Oh, they're all big guys.

[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:27.640]
Well, including four to six 30.

[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:30.160]
It's Mad Dog at the Mickey Eris in Yinter Arena.

[00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:31.720]
Panther preview six 30.

[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:34.520]
They're on the road to play the Bruins at the Fleet Enema Center,

[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.620]
seven o'clock in Jesse Agward, ten o'clock for nine for Eddie Kay.

[00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:38.880]
Well, look at this schedule.

[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.660]

I got it in my pile somewhere.

[00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:40.700]
That was the one constant is the Bush twins are third.

David Lohan, 16.

[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.400]
Very bombed.

[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:41.980]
Very bombed.

[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:44.420]
What's going on?

[00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:45.980]
With very bombed.

[00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:50.480]
From sports, he was treated right to the devil.

[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.220]
Well, everybody saying I take roads.

[00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:58.500]
You know, you just inspired me before you're coming about how everybody hates him, which is true.

[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:02.060]
But for a pool of water, I'm going to push tomorrow's pool back to a Wednesday.

[00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:02.860]
Yeah.

[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:04.400]
I'm pushing things back.

[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:05.320]
I'm talking about Josh, not you.

[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:05.680]
Okay.

[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.020]
I'm pushing some things back, until tomorrow.

[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:07.100]
Okay.

[00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:09.580]
So you're pushing them back in the next week.

[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:10.880]
Wow.

[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.600]
You sure going to have a whole inventory of stocked up there.

[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.040]
Take a keep busy.

[00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:16.020]
A lot of material.

[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.040]
Wow.

[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:18.600]
In other words, you went back in there again.

[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:19.500]
Is that what you told me?

[00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:22.180]
I went back and somebody's some different person.

[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.140]
Is there the same person?

[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:23.860]
Is all like...

[00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:24.900]
What's going on there?

[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.220]
What is going on in here?

[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:26.480]

[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:29.400]
This is one of the great scandals of all time.

[00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:31.860]
They're all lined up at the tea room and they're all on the throne.

[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:32.680]
No, I've got to say this.

[00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:35.580]
The handy crapper is open, but I can't use that one because...

[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:36.320]
Oh, I like that one.

[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:39.420]
It's big in the bars, which is nice, but the seat sits too high.

[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.580]
Oh, that's right.

[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.180]
A little midget like you can.

[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.140]
You need to look like a step lighter to climb up on it.

[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.100]
I need to firm foothold.

[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.660]
I can't go over my feet or dangling.

[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.600]
Oh, well maybe somebody just holds you up above the right spot.

[00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:53.400]
Maybe I'll take a stool with me.

[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:54.660]
No, anyway, Josh inspired me.

[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:55.960]
Don't you think that's a good pull?

[00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:56.980]
Who's the most hated at?

[00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:57.900]
And who's your most...

[00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:59.020]
What athlete do you hate the most?

[00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:00.420]
Josh, you think that's good?

[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.540]
He will win.

[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:02.320]
Very bonds?

[00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:02.880]
Yes.

[00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:03.960]
More than OJ?

[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:04.940]
Oh, I don't know.

[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:06.100]
That's a problem.

[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.920]
See, in other words, I wouldn't do the pull if it just to make great bonds look bad,

[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.240]
which he does a good job of themself.

[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:13.380]
But OJ, you think he can beat?

[00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:14.320]
I think he can beat Rose?

[00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:15.880]
No, he won't be.

[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:16.260]
He won't be.

[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:16.860]
He won't be.

[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.700]
Maybe Pete Rose will give him a run for the money.

[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.020]
Yeah.

[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:20.020]
Well, we'll do that tomorrow.

[00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:21.300]
I like that pull.

[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.680]
Okay, anyway, the greatest baseball tire of all time.

[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:24.420]
That's the one for today.

[00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:25.540]
Let's stick to the day first.

[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:27.020]
Okay, let's not get too far ahead.

[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:30.320]
Although George has been making a run to the head and they're doing much good.

[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:32.060]
644 votes.

[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:33.200]
Babe Ruth 130.

[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:33.860]
That was my vote.

[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:36.560]
That's what I told you on Friday before we took any of vote.

[00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:37.340]
Baby Ruth.

[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.280]
Great pitcher, great hitter, great starter.

[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.700]
Not the fastest of foot.

[00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:44.380]
But nevertheless, and I was back in the day of the dead ball.

[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:48.920]
I suppose the live ball, all this water down expansion, all these girls teams.

[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:49.900]
Babe Ruth 130.

[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:51.060]
I hate baseball 105.

[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:51.780]
Yeah, we figured.

[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:52.900]
Willie May is 82.

[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:53.840]
Say, hey, Willie.

[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:54.920]
I hate this pull.

[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:55.460]
69.

[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:56.220]
We hate.

[00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:57.680]
Ted Williams 58.

[00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:59.080]
The splendid splitter.

[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.380]
Hank Aaron 47.

[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.180]
Hammer and Hank.

[00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:03.040]
Mickey Maddle 36.

[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:05.720]
PD Rose got 30, man.

[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:08.020]
$30 bills stacked up on the table.

[00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:10.180]
They're at the track and they'll all be gone in about a half an hour.

[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:11.580]
Very bonds 26.

[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:12.860]
So he's in.

[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:13.300]
Let's see.

[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:18.000]
If you take off the eight, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, seven place.

[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:19.280]
Do it a magic or 24.

[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:20.200]
Just too behind.

[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.220]
But very bonds never had Marilyn Monroe.

[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:26.320]
Lou Gehrig 16, Thai Cobb 14, and Roberto Clemente 9.

[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.460]
I mean, the fact Thai Cobb's only got 14.

[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:30.860]
That's a time timeline thing.

[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.160]
See what I'm saying?

[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:33.040]
Yes.

[00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:35.080]
Most people don't know from Thai Cobb.

[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:36.520]
There would no Thai Cobb and Kornama.

[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:38.780]
It's just a whole from Eddie Cobb.

[00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:39.580]
What do you mean?

[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:41.260]
I'm saying, right, that's where we are right now.

[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:42.900]
And you're not doing so great, you're guy.

[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:45.580]
I didn't expect you to buy that book yet.

[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.640]
What are you shmerkling about?

[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.220]
You're waiting for me to send it to you, aren't you?

[00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:50.320]
Why would I buy that book?

[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:54.000]
Because you're a big fan of very bonds and you know, if you had open mind.

[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.460]
If you want to hear the truth, if you want to hear the truth,

[00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:57.760]
they'll set you free.

[00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:58.200]
Who came?

[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.320]
My Georgia's waiting for the truth to send him free.

[00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:01.320]
It doesn't matter.

[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:05.660]
The truth being that somebody finally vacated the tea room near me has got the green one.

[00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:08.160]
You're going to have to send a scout before I bother walking over there.

[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:08.920]
I cannot believe.

[00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:11.340]
This has been going on for an hour now.

[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:11.780]
Right.

[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:15.940]
That poor little Georgia's just been trying to make it for a couple of pounds lighter.

[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.040]
There's no light in there.

[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:20.100]
So, you know, like in the old building, in the old radio station,

[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.400]
you could be people who would sit in there and be all be all be all be.

[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:22.700]
What do you mean by that?

[00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:23.440]
You mean, IOD?

[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:25.740]
You mean, you could be places you've been before have good lighting in the toilet.

[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:26.720]
Like in a real radio studio.

[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.100]
So, people sit and read all day.

[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:32.880]
Do you know that at INZ, Slice Zeta, some of us, some of us hot shots like me,

[00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:34.620]
we used to get to use the executive tea room.

[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:38.540]
Ooh, which was right adjacent to the big, little mangoes orfers.

[00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:38.580]

[00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:41.220]
That's the one where that's snake on the floor.

[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:41.960]
Okay.

[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:43.820]
A little, a small, little snake.

[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:44.780]
Hey, listen.

[00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:46.060]
How about joking?

[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:48.760]
I'll brave a python or a terrestrial or anything.

[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:49.560]
Well, what do you think, Rayan?

[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.900]
Like, look at that snake I'm sitting there on the throne.

[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:54.580]
I see this thing and it's a very, very small terrestrial by the way.

[00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:55.920]
I thought, oh, it's getting a little crowded in here.

[00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:57.740]
I think I'll evacuate.

[00:31:58.420 --> 00:31:58.600]
A way.

[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:02.300]
New York Times obtained secret memo of Bush and Blair meeting me for our rack war.

[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:05.340]
Oh, we should take a call or two before we start heading into my big pile.

[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:09.360]
Then we got that Beasley story about the Beasley's who can't afford to give you guys an extra dime,

[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:12.960]
but they can afford to borrow 17 million to go and buy another radio station.

[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:15.460]
What about your clowns you people are over there, man?

[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:16.400]
Clowns.

[00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:17.360]
But they keep paying me.

[00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:18.080]
That's all I care about.

[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:19.480]
W.A.M. Hello.

[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:20.240]
I get work.

[00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:20.980]
Yeah.

[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:22.840]
Oh, he should be under, though, shouldn't he?

[00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:24.280]
As much as I hate golf.

[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:25.420]
I mean, that's a game.

[00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:26.100]
It's not a sport.

[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.000]
But let's put them on their Tiger Woods, right?

[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:28.660]
Right.

[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:29.940]
Even a whistichoman.

[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:31.720]
W.A.M. Hello.

[00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:32.980]
Q.A.M.

[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.980]
Hey, put this Pope robot on the list.

[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:36.940]
Put it on my ass.

[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:37.680]
Get out of here.

[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.900]
Probably got a Biff Poke Robo blow up doll.

[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:41.540]
I did like him a lot though.

[00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:47.620]
The New York Times reports that a secret memo from January 2003 reveals the President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair.

[00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:51.320]
Agreed to invade Iraq even without you and backing Ross story has learned.

[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:52.840]
There's that Ross story again, man.

[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:55.480]
The article written by Don Van Natt, a junior.

[00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:57.660]
I wonder if he's kind of Don Irvine, junior.

[00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:03.440]
Addresses of the January 31st, 2003 memorandum, which is linked to British author and reference in February of this year.

[00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:08.000]
The New York Times was able to obtain a copy of the secret memo and confirms most of the reports.

[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:13.160]
Two senior British officials confirm the authenticity of the memo, but declined to talk further about it.

[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:18.560]
Sighting Brian's official Britain's official secret act, which makes it illegal for the violence classified information.

[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.200]
I was thinking of Brian Siria, I'm sorry.

[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:31.720]
Van Natt's article contains many quotations from the memo that haven't been previously disclosed and refers to it as striking in its character's characterization of Frank almost casual conversation by Bush and Blair about the most serious subjects.

[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:38.760]
Bush expected Iraq's army to fold very quickly and also told the Prime Minister that he thought the Republican Guard would be decimated by the bombing.

[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:44.840]
As for the future government of Iraq, people would find it very odd if we handed over to another dictator Blair as quoted as saying.

[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:51.940]
According to an article on the memo published by the Guardian in February, Mr. Bush made it clear the US intended to invade whether or not there was a second UN resolution,

[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:56.620]
and even if UN inspectors found no evidence of a band of Iraqi weapons program.

[00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:01.660]
The diplomatic strategy had to be arranged around the military planning regarding a report on the Bush-Tool Blair.

[00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:04.820]
The diplomatic strategy had to be arranged around the military planning.

[00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:07.140]
The Prime Minister of said to have raised no objection.

[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:13.260]
He's quoted as saying he was solidly with the President ready to do whatever it took to disarm old Sodom and Gomorrah.

[00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:24.800]
The memo also said to reveal that President Bush suggested flying YouTuber commissons aircraft planes with fighter cover over Iraq, painted in new and colors in order to provoke Saddam to shoot on them, therefore putting Iraq in breach of UN resolutions.

[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:33.900]
The memo was first obtained by Philip Sands, a professor of international law at a British University, and probably a distant relative of Tommy Sands, who had a teenage crush.

[00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:35.740]
I like that.

[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:39.640]
The evidence is all there, but don't confuse the public with the facts.

[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:43.360]
Remember Tommy Sands' capital records, teenage crush? How about orange crush?

[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:44.880]
They still make that, don't they?

[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:46.920]
I think so, and it's a lot of places.

[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:48.060]
Orange crush?

[00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:51.060]
I mean, I think they make sugar-free dammit.

[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.860]
They do make sugar-free Dr. Pepper, but not can't feed free.

[00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:55.040]
I do like Dr. Pepper.

[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:56.120]
I think they make sugar-free crush.

[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:56.900]
They do?

[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:57.660]
I think so.

[00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:59.760]
Well, I'll be damned. I'm going to go out and scout for it today.

[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:02.880]
You haven't got your pasta yet.

[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:03.680]
No, I haven't.

[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.600]
I'm trying to turn my life around.

[00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:08.860]
It has turned my big fat ass around.

[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:09.600]
Wow.

[00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:10.720]
It's right there.

[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:12.160]
Dreamfield's low-car pasta.

[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:14.320]
It's right above O.J. and the O.D.

[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:14.440]
The O.D.

[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:16.220]
I'm going to do it.

[00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:17.240]
You should do it.

[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:18.540]
It's no different.

[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:28.620]
I mean, it's exactly the same.

[00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:29.620]
I mean, look who you are.

[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.040]
I got no complaints from you guys.

[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:32.760]
I got no complaints from you guys.

[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:32.760]

[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:32.760]

[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:32.760]

[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:33.220]
I got no complaints from you guys.

[00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:34.560]
I got no complaints from you guys.

[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:35.240]
I got no complaints from you guys.

[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.180]
I got no complaints from you guys.

[00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:38.300]
I got no complaints from you guys.

[00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:40.380]
I got no complaints from you guys.

[00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:40.980]
I got no complaints from you guys.

[00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:47.160]
I got no complaints from you guys.

[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:54.160]
I got no complaints from you guys.

[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:55.580]
I got no complaints from you guys.

[00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:55.920]
I got no complaints from you guys.

[00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:56.960]
I got no complaints from you guys.

[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:56.960]

[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:56.960]

[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:56.960]

[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.600]
I got no complaints from you guys.

[00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:04.220]
You've been awake for 10 minutes and already you put fake vomit in the sink.

[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:07.800]
Fill the sugar bowl with salt, put plastic wrap over the toilet,

[00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:10.420]
and bake doggy-do on the doorstep.

[00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:17.980]
You arrive first at the office, unblogged everyone's computer monitor

[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:23.620]
and distribute a fake memo about switching from casual Fridays to bikini Fridays.

[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:29.400]
And don't forget your fart machine.

[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:32.620]
You found a good one with a motion sensor...

[00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:35.760]
So the next time you thank you, I can escape him.

[00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:40.920]
What do you, you, you, that superg路, with my microphone?

[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:45.860]
When I get on the step, I'm gonna hurt you down like a dog Mr. Overzealous.

[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:49.000]
To go to the jumper, a real American hero.

[00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:52.520]
Mr. Overzealous, panic, go go go.

[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:54.020]
I don't know how, anyone?

[00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:56.180]
Somebody help me please.

[00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:58.580]
I mean, that's why Brett was in the team room so long.

[00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:00.660]
He's putting the SRAN rap over the toilet seat.

[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.240]
Well, now George isn't trouble because he's in there.

[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:03.100]
All right.

[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:05.200]
Well, maybe he bring back AS Pesseman.

[00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:08.080]
It's 10.45 at 5.60 p.m.

[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:08.920]
WQAM.

[00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:11.120]
So here's the deal for $17 million.

[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:14.560]
Visley Broadcast Group has acquired news talk, KDWN,

[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:16.840]
from independent Broadcaster Radion of Adacorp.

[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.960]
The deal gives Visley its first A.M. in Vegas.

[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:21.180]
And it's fourth station in market number two,

[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:23.600]
32, one of the nation's fastest growing markets.

[00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:25.160]
Oh, Vegas.

[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.000]
Visley intends to fund the purchase of KDWN

[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.580]
with borrowings under its existing credit facility.

[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:31.860]
Oh, God.

[00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:34.740]
This acquisition broadens our presence in the fast growing

[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:38.160]
Las Vegas market and is consistent with our long-term strategy

[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:40.920]
to develop our clusters to their fullest potential.

[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.960]
Visley Chairman and CEO George Visley said,

[00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:44.540]
oh yeah, you're developing my cluster.

[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:45.880]
I've said it that. It's called Roids.

[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:49.940]
The addition of KDWN improves an already great cluster

[00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:53.940]
creating additional economies of scale while enabling us to provide more choices for our listeners

[00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:56.520]
and any more robust platform for our advertisers.

[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:57.520]
Wow.

[00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:00.280]
I expect to close early in quarter three this year.

[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.540]
So by the fall we ought to be in Vegas.

[00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:03.460]
All right.

[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:05.240]
Isn't that the big improvement for you guys?

[00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:05.980]
Yeah, what?

[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:08.720]
And with the big money Josh is making from that new deal.

[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:11.440]
So how was it in there?

[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.260]
I'm actually the only one who can put you in a coma.

[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:14.540]
Oh, yes!

[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:15.500]
Wow.

[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:16.700]
I didn't care.

[00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:17.580]
I didn't care.

[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.040]
Well, I would imagine at this point you wouldn't care.

[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:21.840]
I feel like it was right a mile.

[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:23.640]
So the coast was finally clear.

[00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:23.800]
Woo!

[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:26.760]
The coast was there in the highest.

[00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:29.800]
And hour and a half of squeezing for good reason.

[00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:33.520]
Oh, I forgot to mention right after that we usually do the dead celebrities red to beginning,

[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:34.880]
but who the hell knows Buck Owens.

[00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:37.780]
Buck Owens co-host of televisions Heha.

[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:38.540]
Right.

[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:42.180]
And who shaped the side of country music with hits like Act Naturally is died.

[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:43.000]
He was 76.

[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:45.820]
He had more than 20 number one record.

[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:46.500]
Did you know that?

[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:47.180]
No.

[00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:49.540]
But I'm sure that must be on the country chart.

[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:50.180]
Not like.

[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:50.640]
Yeah.

[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:53.220]
The cause of death wasn't immediately known Owens in the ground.

[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:53.980]
Stroke cancer.

[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:56.720]
Surgery in 93 was hospitalized with pneumonia in 97.

[00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:58.160]
It sounds to me like a smoker.

[00:38:58.280 --> 00:38:59.220]
I couldn't be wrong about that.

[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:00.500]
Sounds like a big smoker.

[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:01.460]
Probably.

[00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:06.500]
The real Heha anything that I have in here says.

[00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:07.120]
What is that?

[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:09.060]
The Heha Gospel quartet.

[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:11.020]
Oh, singing.

[00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:11.920]
Wait a little longer.

[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:12.800]
Please be.

[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:14.620]
Oh yeah, wait a little longer please.

[00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:15.380]
Oh, it's speaking.

[00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:16.420]
But I was thinking of the 40.

[00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:17.040]
Jesus.

[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:22.860]
Let me just make a little a center message along here on the air to my neighbor who keeps,

[00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:24.060]
you know, Jesus.

[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:26.220]
There are no Jesus Christers in my house.

[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.060]
Okay, present past or future.

[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.280]
And they're not going to be.

[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:32.760]
So stop leaving religious books on my doorstep.

[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:33.960]
I'm going to tell you seriously.

[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:37.740]
This is what people, this is what pisses people off about the religious nuts.

[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:38.240]
That's right.

[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:39.740]
You just can't leave other people alone.

[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.440]
You want to believe any crappy one.

[00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:43.940]
You want to put up that he has risen flag every other day.

[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:46.420]
Every other sookists, whatever you want, fine.

[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:48.840]
But leave in religious books on my doorstep.

[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:49.740]
They're get away.

[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:50.760]
Go away.

[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:53.100]
Can I have your answer arrested for trespassing?

[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:54.340]
You crazy people.

[00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:58.740]
Anyway, Bucco and Square was one of the most phenomenal in country music with a string of more than 20.

[00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:01.580]
Number one records most released in the mid 60s and mid 70s.

[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:02.460]
Well, I got to look that up.

[00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:02.980]
Right.

[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:07.620]
Well, I'm sure that means number one in the country charts, not in the pop charts.

[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:10.180]
There's no way in the country charts have courses.

[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:10.700]
Course.

[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:11.440]
Of course.

[00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:13.840]
But there's Roy Orbison, nice shades.

[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:15.720]
And the Osman.

[00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:17.680]
So there's Regio and the Manhattan spiritual.

[00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:18.700]
Well, I bet you don't have that.

[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:19.480]
That was a good song.

[00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:20.740]
Two, it's two, 58.

[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:21.700]
Regio and.

[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:22.240]
Sorry, no.

[00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:22.740]
In instrumental.

[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:23.720]
No, no, no.

[00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:24.600]
Great record.

[00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:25.740]
Who am I looking for?

[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:26.880]
Oh, Bucco ones.

[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:28.000]
Oh, it's a matter of fact.

[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:29.820]
He never had anything on the pop charts.

[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:30.840]
He had won the song.

[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:33.180]
It was number 25 in 1965.

[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:34.820]
We got a Tiger by the tail.

[00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:36.240]
Bobbi was number one country.

[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:36.920]
It's for five weeks.

[00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:37.260]
See?

[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:39.340]
All of his big hits were in country music.

[00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:41.020]
No, it's picking redneck charts.

[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:43.040]
Yeah, nothing comes up on my computer.

[00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:44.040]
Yeah, of course.

[00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:44.360]
Hop.

[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:45.900]
Strictly crap.

[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:49.920]
His hits were recorded with a hockey-talk twang that came to be known throughout California.

[00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:54.060]
The Bacus Field Sound, named for a town 100 miles north of LA, that owns called home.

[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:55.280]
The Bacus Field Sound.

[00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:56.140]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:59.840]
I think the reason it was so well known and respected by younger generation of country musicians,

[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:03.280]
because he was an innovator and a rebel, said whoever this is.

[00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:06.560]
Somebody, Jim Shaw, who played keyboards in Owens band.

[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:07.500]
The Bucca Rooz.

[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:09.480]
Oh, that's where I was Buccoons in the Bucca Rooz.

[00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:13.040]
He did it out of the Nashville establishment, had a raw edge.

[00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:14.320]
Oh, God.

[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:16.560]
Buccoons is dead and believe me, none too soon.

[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:17.040]
Who cares?

[00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:19.780]
Oh, and how about that guy that got co-bound there at Homestead this weekend?

[00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:20.280]
You see that?

[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:20.840]
Yes, I did.

[00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:23.180]
Well, that is what it's all about, isn't it?

[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:23.740]
Yes, it is.

[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:25.560]
Although it's going as round and round.

[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:26.800]
He had as fast as they can.

[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:27.760]
No, it's proud to see you.

[00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:28.460]
Fire-recrapt.

[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:29.560]
It was a proud who was the only impractist.

[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:30.860]
I know that.

[00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:32.280]
He had the decency to wait for that round.

[00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:35.040]
He was trying to run.

[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:54.580]
He was trying to run.

[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:55.380]
He was trying to run.

[00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:55.380]

[00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:55.380]

[00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:55.380]

[00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:55.380]

[00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:55.380]

[00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:55.400]
He was trying to run.

[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:55.400]

[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:55.400]

[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:55.400]

[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:55.400]

[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:55.400]

[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:55.400]

[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:55.400]

[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:55.400]

[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:55.400]

[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:55.400]

[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:55.400]

[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:55.400]

[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:55.400]

[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:55.940]
He was trying to run.

[00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:57.280]

Is this the Hail Dodger fought?

[00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:03.500]
Is this the Hail Dodger fight?

[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:04.420]
Is this the Hail Dodger fought?

[00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:04.420]

[00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:04.420]

[00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:04.420]

[00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:10.320]
Who has to go to work every day?

[00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:17.380]
She said, is desk making clothes for Kathie Lee?

[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:22.360]
Loves the work but doesn't love the pain

[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:28.540]
They are the kids who make the clothing

[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:34.820]
They are the ones who make the bucket days of week-home planning

[00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:38.740]
It's just clothes and making

[00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:47.720]
The kind you love to buy is sure they make a bucket day with Kathie Lee

[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:53.220]
And there's everything so on, by the way, all this hoopla on all this carrying on around the country

[00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:57.140]
Many people were protesting against the illegal war in Iraq and all these dead people

[00:48:57.140 --> 00:48:59.180]
Then I'd say, hey, you go for it

[00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:01.640]
But all these people that are running around carrying on

[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:03.680]
All they're doing is saying, hey, we're breaking the law

[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:05.100]
We're legally, we want to be legal

[00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:08.060]
We want you to change the law so that illegal aliens can become...

[00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:09.060]
That's what it's really all about

[00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:10.720]
That's re-warred lawbreakers

[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:14.420]
That's right, let's re-warred people for like digging those tunnels and coming through your legal

[00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:17.420]
So that all your big business can have a bunch of cheap labor

[00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:20.640]
And maybe Americans would do those jobs if they offered them a decent wage

[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:23.440]
Maybe the Haitians would do it

[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:24.200]
There you go

[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:26.000]
I just said that for that kind of Haitian invasion

[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.360]
I had a Haitian fix a flat tire over the weekend

[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:30.900]
Nothing wrong with the Haitians, man

[00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:34.060]
They saw them baseballs real tight so very bonds could hit some home runs

[00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:36.080]
I'd tell you what he told me but we'd have to dump it

[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:36.960]
Oh, really?

[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:37.460]
Yeah

[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:39.400]
You don't have to do it like a blood clot?

[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:42.180]
No, I'm not that said you're making thing, I'm sorry

[00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:42.600]
That's right

[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:43.800]
Well, some kind of a clot

[00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:45.980]
Anyway, just look up, Ma, were you shut up?

[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:48.620]
Ma, did you know that Ma's makes...

[00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:50.120]
Well, we knew three must-goot tears, right?

[00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:50.620]

[00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:55.240]
You know that Ma... See, Ma's was the family that invented this stuff that's killing us

[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:58.020]
They killed people for years with their addictive candy

[00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:00.500]
M&Ms, did you know that Ma's made M&Ms?

[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:01.620]
No, I didn't

[00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:03.040]
God, a wheeler needs some crap today

[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:05.500]
Man, you kids out there, this is as educational as it gets

[00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:08.500]
You learn more on this show in a half an hour than you were in school in 15 years

[00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:08.800]
What?

[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:09.780]
I belched

[00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:12.460]
Oh, here they got a nicer website

[00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:16.480]
Today Ma's is an 18, they ought to have, it's an $18 billion business

[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:21.660]
Oh, and speaking of that, our total on our fundraiser, $220,755

[00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:24.380]
Ooh, wait, man, it's just pouring in by the dollar

[00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:25.480]
I don't care

[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:26.040]
Good

[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:29.840]
Perhaps more surprisingly, unusual for business of our size, we're still privately owned

[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:32.940]
making us one of the largest small family businesses in the world that says here

[00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:35.580]
And it goes on and on and on

[00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:38.800]
And it's got a picture of... I can't tell what that other thing is

[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:40.380]
It's got a three must-goot tears bar

[00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:42.920]
And I don't like three must-goot tears, kind of like mooshy

[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:44.540]
You know, not like mooshy candy

[00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:46.300]
True, yeah, exactly, it's all with mooshy

[00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:47.660]
You don't have anything exciting in it

[00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:47.980]
That's right

[00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:51.340]
As opposed to a Mars bar, now Mars bars when you put them in a freezer

[00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:54.780]
Ooh, they got the shredded coconut, and I'm like crazy about that

[00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:55.260]
Shredded coconut?

[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:56.560]
Don't think? Mars bars?

[00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:58.740]
I don't like shredded, that shredded coconut

[00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:00.780]
No, that's almond joy here

[00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:03.220]
You better get with it, Mr. You don't need any meaty bars

[00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:05.240]
I'm going to tell you the Mars dinners

[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:06.980]
I think they're going to call in here pretty soon

[00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:08.360]
I want a second opinion

[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:10.420]
What? I think they both have shredded coconut

[00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:11.260]
Let me say it again

[00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:13.180]
Mars bars doesn't have any coconut

[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:15.140]
I'll tell you what, during the next break

[00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:17.500]
I'll go across to the convenience store and I'll get one

[00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:18.900]
Okay, that's good

[00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:20.860]
I won't eat it, I don't want it

[00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:21.700]
I don't want it

[00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:24.280]
No, I don't want no candy bars

[00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:28.400]
Here's a very amusing, this fact is very funny

[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:30.380]
And you want to know why, look at the header on it

[00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:30.780]
Yeah, I know

[00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:33.620]
Oh, it says Neil, although I know this is a chronic regular

[00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:35.760]
So it's obviously a fake header, the whole thing is fake

[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:38.320]
Although there's no doubt that Barnes is a Hall of Fame player

[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:40.700]
Probably 200 of his home runs are tainted right now

[00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:43.880]
Chances are he would have done 500-500 for a career

[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:46.420]
Great stats, but certainly not nearly the best ever

[00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:49.280]
Certainly Willie May is my vote was truly the greatest player

[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:52.000]
No, I wouldn't say certainly, but they're your entire, that opinion

[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.460]
And Babe Ruth had more home runs than entire teams during the dead ball

[00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:56.040]
Or a butt

[00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:58.560]
Never faced blacks or his spanish, Babe Ruth

[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:00.400]
And then the header says the Vesquez family

[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:01.680]
Well, how's Hasinto doing?

[00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:04.220]
Still having trouble finding the finish line?

[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:07.300]
Hasinto Vesquez my ass?

[00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:07.760]
God

[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:10.860]
Now here's the, what is this thing? I'm supposed to be able to read this

[00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:12.200]
This is a good, lucky, lucky, lucky

[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:13.240]
How are we good in this commentary?

[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:14.120]
Like I want to see?

[00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:14.740]
Just throw it away

[00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:16.320]
Yeah, I'm going to throw it away

[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:17.780]
Officials here, Robert Gack there

[00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:20.760]
We were, we were, I've talked about this a long time ago

[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:21.720]
This is old news

[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:25.200]
This is old news about the way the state of Florida is punishing this guy

[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:28.700]
For trying to, you know, get the voting machine straight now, Ma'am

[00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:29.440]
I am Sancio

[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:31.080]
How many stories did I have about this?

[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:32.040]
About third matter

[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:33.720]
You know, sending me this ancient crap

[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:35.540]
You people need to get with it

[00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:37.720]
You're interesting and he might have some ancient crap

[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:38.520]
Not anymore, man

[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:39.840]
No, thank God

[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:40.140]
Whoo

[00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:42.600]
From the Paleolithic age

[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:43.140]
Wow

[00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:45.600]
I just buy that shocking to me

[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:47.460]
Because knowing the lay of the land there

[00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:48.560]
And of course to show you

[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:54.300]
Maybe they're starting to lay down some real serious threats when that sales core, you know?

[00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:55.940]
That could be, it was right after that sales meeting

[00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:58.000]
Good, that's it, and they're all in there

[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.220]
And believe you me, those guys ought to be doing a green apple quick step right out the door

[00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:04.140]
Twice strapped from near the front of the list by the way

[00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:07.300]
Here's a guy inherited a bunch of accounts that have had on the year for years

[00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:10.600]
And he is working selectively one by one to destroy them

[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:14.800]
And as far as service and account and copy, forget about not in his lingo

[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:16.080]
It's not in his lexicon

[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:17.760]
Is nobody's driving lexicon?

[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:22.540]
Oh, I don't forget if you drive a lexicon, you can park free at the Panthers starting July 1st at the Amacarina

[00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:24.240]
But if you don't, it's going to cost you $100

[00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:28.120]
The greatest baseball player of all time, we've got almost 800 votes already

[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:30.080]
This one is turning their fancy shmancy

[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:34.040]
How do you like that, Josh? We got the 758

[00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:37.200]
I bet you got very bonds that are bad in the 758

[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:39.160]
Babe Ruth 157

[00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:42.340]
Now have you ever seen like Clipskillm clips of Babe Ruth?

[00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:43.280]
Yeah, I was in

[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:45.020]
A little bit tight and well aware of Babe Ruth

[00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:47.420]
Actually, I don't know, he might have been tall, but he was a tub

[00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:49.080]
He was tubby, yeah, he was fat

[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:49.660]
Yes, you are

[00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:54.020]
He looked about as much like an athlete as a baseball player, Mickey Lola, you know, fat

[00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:56.720]
He could play some, his fair share of positions though

[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:59.160]
Couldn't run, but why do you keep saying that?

[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:01.220]
He played, he was a pitcher and he played right field

[00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:03.700]
I don't know, any other position the ever player than maybe prone

[00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:05.440]
We might have played first, like, okay

[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:06.560]
No, I don't think so

[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:07.860]
I can't believe he played first place

[00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:08.980]
He did with who?

[00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:11.300]
I said he might have, a little bit

[00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:12.540]
I can play first place

[00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:14.940]
You know, you're starting to really frost my ass

[00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:16.340]
Lightly frosted

[00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:19.560]
And I'm not that think of a Babe Ruth fan, it's not like I was alive

[00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:21.500]
You know, I'm even as anxious as I am, just a minute

[00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:23.660]
I'm Googling, man, I'm Googling over here

[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:25.180]
Oh, yeah, don't worry

[00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:27.080]
Baby Ruth, here we go

[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:30.040]
Let's see, the official Babe Ruth website, how do you like that?

[00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:31.520]
Yeah, he did play first place also

[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:32.540]
He did? Yeah

[00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:35.720]
Well, I mean, all these guys when they get to the end of the career when they're totally immobile

[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:39.360]
But he was never very immobile in the first place, they put him like a statue on first place

[00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:40.580]
No, I mean, like in the middle

[00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:42.960]
Kind of like where a mousse scour used to be

[00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:45.100]
In Johnny May, you know, like 13 games

[00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:45.920]
How about Johnny Mays?

[00:54:45.940 --> 00:54:48.000]
Was he Chapliber or was Robert Johnny Mays?

[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:49.420]
Are you anti-Samanthic or something?

[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:52.480]
And what about Al Rosen speaking to Jewish ball players in Hank Greenberg?

[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:55.340]
And Bugsy Solomon

[00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:56.520]
Who? I don't know

[00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:00.240]
769 votes on there, and Barry Barnes is still sucking wind

[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:02.680]
In fact, Pete Rose passed him, Joe Demagio passed him

[00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:03.940]
Look at Jolton Joe's got

[00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:08.240]
I mentioned Marilyn Monroe's name, Jolton Joe got some more admiration there

[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:09.540]
Oh, Jolton Joe

[00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:11.220]
Oh, we know it's not a crowd, it's listening to the crowd

[00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:12.740]
Good, God, what does that mean?

[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:13.900]
It's another two-league-old party

[00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:14.480]
To get the flow to this end today

[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:16.120]
I see, only old people

[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:19.560]
Okay, let's take a poll if you're under the age of Florida, how's that?

[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:46.700]
First of all, how to, like a 20-year-old guy

[00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:48.300]
What does he know about great baseball players?

[00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:55.580]
What does that mean?

[00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:05.080]
What does that mean?

[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:05.100]

[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:05.100]

[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:05.100]

[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:05.100]

[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:05.100]

[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:05.100]

[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:05.100]

[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:05.100]

[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:05.100]

[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:05.100]

[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:05.100]

[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:05.100]

[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:05.100]

[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:05.100]

[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:05.100]

[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:05.100]

[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:05.100]

[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:05.300]
What does that mean?

[00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:05.300]

[00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:05.300]

[00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:05.500]
What does that mean?

[00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:06.000]
What does that mean?

[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:06.340]
What does that mean?

[00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:08.400]
What does that mean?

[00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:09.420]
What does that mean?

[00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:11.360]
What does that mean?

[00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:18.280]
What does that mean?

[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:20.180]
He kept teasing before commercials

[00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:22.500]
He was going to talk about the situation with my buddy Neil

[00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:24.000]
And he still is my buddy

[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:27.720]
He said he ran something on your 20th and 25th anniversary

[00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:28.940]
And there's nothing left to say

[00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:33.160]
And then an anniversary is not an entitlement to get you name in the newspaper

[00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:35.500]
Oh, I see, I guess the Harold must not feel that way

[00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:37.400]
Not an entitlement to get you name in the paper?

[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:38.820]
Well, what is that?

[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:43.380]
So in other words, he had to put it all up after he wrote the big pieces on the 20th and 25th anniversary

[00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:45.340]
I see, that's it

[00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:46.560]
Well, you know, it's for you Tom

[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:49.860]
He also said it gals me that Neil says I get paid to do this show

[00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:52.440]
I don't care whether I don't give a crap what you get paid or not

[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:55.340]
As if anyone would pay to put a monster's the factor but I digress

[00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:57.380]
He says that would be a conflict of interest

[00:56:57.380 --> 00:57:00.860]
They never take money even when he does other radio shows on other stations

[00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:03.480]
And it isn't right about any cave because they, um, what?

[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:04.880]
They shower together

[00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:11.120]
He also said to ask you if you once said that reading on the air was boring

[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:12.320]
And that polls were weak

[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:13.260]
Mike and Mel Boy

[00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:15.780]
Yeah, reading on the air is boring on us on the one it's doing it

[00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:17.320]
And polls are weak and less word on ones are doing

[00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:18.260]
I like that Tom

[00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:19.020]
I got news for you

[00:57:19.020 --> 00:57:20.540]
There's more entertainment in the first five minutes

[00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:22.780]
And just during the crossover with Hank every day

[00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:25.320]
There's more entertainment than any 400-year comms put together

[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:25.940]
How do you like that?

[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:26.940]
Speak it a week

[00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:28.520]
Speaking of boring

[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:31.680]
Just just Google Tom Jic on a SunCentral thing

[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:34.200]
There, you just go on a SunCentral website and Google Tom Jic and

[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:38.700]
And look at the last 50 comms and see if everyone is in another puff piece

[00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:42.820]
Another one of our standard puff pieces about some stupid ass network TV show

[00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:45.000]
All the same, not one line

[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:48.700]
Forget about me, how about the other people that worked their ass off in his business for years and years?

[00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:51.160]
Nothing, Zipety Duda, Tommy

[00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:53.440]
To matter of fact, I'm going to place something on or him

[00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:59.500]
Oh, I'm dreaming of a...

[00:57:59.500 --> 00:57:59.980]
You know?

[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:01.360]
Yeah

[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:05.440]
See, there's more humor in there than any of Tom Jic's 4000 comms put together

[00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:06.920]
Plus their Q and A on Sunday

[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:11.260]
We finally had to admit that he got the information wrong about Greg butel last Sunday

[00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:15.120]
And about the fact that he got an email from Greg and he's not an Alabama

[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:19.640]
Or he's still an Alabama, what a banjo on his knee and he's also on 640, whatever that is

[00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:21.520]
Oh God, just unbelievable

[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:26.020]
It's one o'clock in the morning when there's nobody awake and he's on you ripping me and I go ahead and Tom have a good time

[00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:27.760]
I'll take my paycheck, no problem

[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:30.740]
You take yours and he still has a fine looking sun

[00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:34.780]
Evangelical teens rally in San Francisco speaking of young people

[00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:37.120]
More than this is so, this is pathetic

[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:40.960]
I'm going to save it for after the break because it's long and I want to interrupt it

[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:44.340]
To tell you what's going on, it's a goi shavelt, isn't that what they say in China?

[00:58:44.380 --> 00:58:46.000]
It's a goi shavelt, I think that's what they say

[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.200]
And they know they're going over there, believe you me

[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:55.640]
I still don't understand how people who are biologically constructed the way the Chinese are have made a billion people

[00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:58.720]
That has to be probably the greatest miracle in the history of human race

[00:58:58.720 --> 00:58:59.960]
The quantity, not quality

[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:03.080]
Now, I'm just telling you, I just don't know how they do it

[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:04.560]
I mean, I think you've got a general idea

[00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:06.980]
This is Neil Rogers

[00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:11.540]
This is 560 QA4

[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:18.160]
It's Hurricane Hotline 1397 from 40 Costa Rica in South Miami

[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:23.300]
Top college hoops with head coach Frank Hayte here on 560 QA-M

[00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:28.940]
Neil, God, Darren Stone is back in basic instinct too

[00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:31.580]
Damn, we're going to take you down to our request

[00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:34.980]
Not now, dear, Matt locks about to come on

[00:59:34.980 --> 00:59:39.760]
She's getting older and she's still up to her old tricks

[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:45.580]
As a request, remember, like you mind if I uncrossed my legs first

[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:47.700]
Frankly, ma'am, yes

[00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:50.340]
Just give me a second

[00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:55.680]
Oh, my heart's the greatest, is asking us to present you up, please

[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:57.560]
I think my knees are not here

[00:59:57.560 --> 00:59:58.160]
Oh, thank God

[00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:00.380]
Does anyone have any bangie?

[01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:02.180]
Basic instinct too

[01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:06.000]
Hot, the sequel with a few new raincoals

[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.940]
I see what's wrong

[01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:12.120]
I need to unsrap my money, a trust first

[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:15.300]
But now, oh wow

[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.120]
There's some more of that great filler material that we play

[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:20.240]
I have to break just as Tom calls it

[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:21.040]
To fill in Indian

[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:25.740]
1160 and 560 WDQM, I got news for he, no sherry woods, he ain't rolling the Thornton

[01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:27.580]
That's for damn sure, he is what he is

[01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:29.560]
Oh, and by the way, more good news from Iraq

[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:32.360]
I don't think we got this in the first bulletin

[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:33.480]
At least 30 people

[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:34.500]
About 30 men

[01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:36.520]
More killed and more than 30 others wounded today

[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:40.080]
By a suicide bomber outside of Northern Iraq recruitment center for security forces

[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:43.360]
However, the Iraqi Ministry of Defense said 40 people were dead

[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:45.520]
So, you know, 30, 40, who's counting?

[01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:47.560]
It's unclear who might have suffered casualties

[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:52.000]
But US military spokesmen said no Americans were injured, thanks God

[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:56.640]
That's what it says right there in the CNN story, thanks God, in parentheses

[01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:59.760]
Here's that story again about them evangelical teens

[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:02.680]
What is wrong with you people? Are you crazy or what?

[01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:03.860]
Oh God

[01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:08.640]
More than 25,000 evangelical Christian youth slanted Friday in San Francisco

[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:14.160]
For a two-day rally at AT&T Park against the virtue terrorism of popular culture

[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:17.620]
And they were greeted by an official city condemnation in a clutch of protesters

[01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:20.880]
Who said they were a vending man to a fascist mega-pepper alley

[01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:24.700]
A fascist mega-pepper alley

[01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:25.620]
You know it

[01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:27.820]
Sounds like a cabinet meeting in the White House

[01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:33.980]
Vattle cry for a generation led by a 44-year-old concord native Ronald Lewis who wants God's instruction book

[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:37.220]
To guide young people away from the corrupting influence of popular culture

[01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:40.520]
Lewis whose teen-manual organization is based in Texas

[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:43.400]
Kicked off a three-day reverse rebellion to a Friday night

[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:47.820]
And tended to counter a popular culture that he says glamorizes violence and sex

[01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:53.260]
The $55 advance ticket for two days of musical performances and speeches were sold out

[01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:55.900]
But walk-up admission was available for $199 bucks

[01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:56.880]
What a bargoon

[01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:01.000]
While those kids were there busy in San Francisco, and if Park George was smoking it

[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.740]
Watching some getcha there at the where was it the macarena?

[01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:05.500]
A pulpit O B champ theater

[01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:09.960]
What was that? Some Hacita rock star?

[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.540]
Even bother, you know, you checked out musically a long time ago, maybe 20 years or something

[01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:14.900]
Yeah, oh I see

[01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:16.040]
It's good, what's your guy's name?

[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:16.940]
Matis Yahoo

[01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:18.260]
Now do you know who that is?

[01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:18.660]
YAHU?

[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:20.320]
Matis YAHU

[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:21.080]
YAHU?

[01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:21.800]
That's right

[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:23.720]
Whoever heard of a Jew named Yahoo

[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:24.560]
Everybody

[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:26.460]
I've heard of BB Netanyahu

[01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:27.240]
There you go

[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:29.600]
And by the way, how's everybody all Shirondo?

[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:30.420]
Let's see him no more

[01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:32.420]
I want to talk about the concert though I gotta say

[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:33.600]
He was marching

[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:35.480]
He was sitting in the first three rows

[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:36.500]
He was marching with Moishi

[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:39.340]
After stops and detroit in Philadelphia in the next few weeks

[01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:43.120]
Lewis wants to unleash a blitz, a blitz of youth pastries and the communities

[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:46.140]
And he said to everything for more for the homeless to find new ways to bring others to Christ

[01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:49.080]
He challenged youth leaders to double their size of the groups next year

[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:53.260]
And let me say it again if my neighbors leave any more Jesus books in my doorstep

[01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:55.680]
Anyplace else, I'm gonna stick them right up their ass

[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:57.120]
God, what a bunch of maniacs

[01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:01.440]
I mean this is what it's all about, they just won't leave you alone

[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:02.520]
They just won't stop

[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:03.920]
You'll thank them from heaven

[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:05.500]
Maybe I need to put up a banner there

[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.380]
Jesus isn't welcome here, okay?

[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:09.420]
Go bother somebody else with your crap

[01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:13.100]
There you go

[01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:14.460]
And then

[01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:17.940]
The loose plans to return to San Francisco next year to chart the progress they're making

[01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:19.540]
Oh yeah, that's a good place for it

[01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:24.960]
That's bad news to Assemblyman Mark Lino, Democrat of San Francisco who told counter protestors at City Hall on Friday

[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:27.200]
There while such fundamentalists may be smaller number

[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:30.300]
They're loud, they're obnoxious, they're disgusting, they should get out of San Francisco

[01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:31.200]
And I would say he is

[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.920]
Absolutely correct sir

[01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:34.920]
Loose didn't flinch in the face of the counter protest

[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:39.300]
The author hosted the acquire the fire TV cable TV program, acquire the fire

[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:47.040]
And a president push a party to a federal anti-dragabuse commission wants teens to find Bible based solutions for the spread of sexually transmitted disease

[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:49.460]
Teen pregnancy drug abuse and suicide

[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:54.540]
That's right, in other words the messages go screw your brains out and then pray like hell to God that you don't catch anything

[01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:55.320]
And that the way it works?

[01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:56.140]
That's the way it works

[01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:56.620]
Yeah

[01:03:57.300 --> 01:04:00.080]
Bible based solution, pray a lot, put your hands together and pray

[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:04.480]
Now Ruchatah said once and then he'd do a couple of brahues there on that concert

[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:06.300]
No, he sings them though

[01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:06.700]
No

[01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:13.700]
The villains loose said range from the promiscuity and sexualization of young people on MTV and the popular online meeting hub MySpace.com

[01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:18.980]
To a corporate culture that spends millions trying to woo the under 21 crowd

[01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:19.820]
Woo and a womb

[01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:24.320]
Battle cry will try to bring them back to God through two days of religious rockers

[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:28.000]
Speakers and the debut of what loose called a Christian alternative for MySpace.com

[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.880]
This is more than a spiritual war loose said it's a culture war

[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:34.780]
Military metaphor is about to lose the description of the struggle

[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:37.800]
He tells young people how an enemy has launched a brutal attack on them

[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:40.880]
At a pre-battle cry rally Friday afternoon in the stiffness city hall

[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:44.120]
Loose told his mostly teenage audience that terrorists of a different kind

[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:47.640]
Advertisers were targeting them that they were caught in the middle of the battle

[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:50.760]
Are you ready to go to battle for your generation? He asked the young people to roar

[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:51.640]
Yes

[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:55.780]
And some way triangular red flag thrown from long media evil looking poles

[01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:59.680]
Oh God there's nothing like a long media evil looking pole

Make Tom Jokka happy.

[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:40.920]
I do want to understand the thing with Tom and me.

[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:42.400]
It's not personal, it's business.

[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:43.640]
I like Tom.

[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:44.600]
Tom's OK personally.

[01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:46.140]
I've had some nice lunches with him.

[01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:47.440]
He's not a bad guy, right?

[01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:48.780]
He's a little step on.

[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:49.760]
He's even shorter than you are.

[01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:51.140]

[01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:52.280]
About two feet tall.

[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:53.560]
No, that's not personal.

[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:54.560]
It's strictly business, Tom.

[01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:55.920]
Don't see.

[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:56.900]
You notice he said that.

[01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:57.920]
I'd look forward to that spy report.

[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:00.020]
I'm surprised we don't have a whole bunch of spy reports.

[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:00.820]
Aren't you?

[01:12:01.340 --> 01:12:01.640]
Absolutely.

[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:03.400]
I think that everybody in town would have been up 1 o'clock.

[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:04.700]
I wonder what he was talking about.

[01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:05.340]
I'm looking for an indication.

[01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:05.860]
That's right.

[01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:06.580]

And making and taking notes to make sure they got all the info right.

[01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:15.060]
5, 6, 7, 0, 0, 5, 60, and pound 5, 60 in the right and singular wireless line.

[01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:16.580]

[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:17.380]
Trust me.

[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:18.080]
I want a second opinion.

[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:19.000]
I know my candy, Mr.

[01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:20.420]
You're going to send me what?

[01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:21.060]
Mars bar?

[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:22.580]
No, I said I want a second opinion.

[01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:22.980]
No.

[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:24.000]
WDQ, I am.

[01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:24.220]
Hello.

[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:25.220]
Hey, Neil.

[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:25.940]
Yes, sir.

[01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:26.740]
You're too, George.

[01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:27.120]
How are you doing?

[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:27.720]
Yo, yo.

[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:33.160]
A few weeks ago, I was flipping the channels on my TV and I came across Benny Hinn.

[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:34.420]
I'm sorry.

[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:35.440]

[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:36.360]
My wife was sitting there.

[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:36.720]
How's the baby?

[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:37.380]
I'm lucky day.

[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:38.660]
Yeah, my wife was sitting there.

[01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:40.400]
When I left it on, I had about 5 minutes.

[01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:40.940]
She turned me.

[01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:41.760]
So this is a joke.

[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.340]
And I thought, this is their dead serious.

[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:46.780]
Yeah, it's a big task for you, Gil, who's what it is.

[01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:48.860]
And she just, she couldn't believe it.

[01:12:48.940 --> 01:12:52.020]
She's, I said, this is, this is what's running the country now.

[01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:53.580]
No, no, that's what's wrong with the world.

[01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:55.420]
It's been on the world ever since the beginning of time.

[01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:56.760]
That's the world for you.

[01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:57.480]
And I love it.

[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:00.000]
The air in the sea when he brings the people out and he touches them and they fall.

[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:01.420]
They all, they all, they all that.

[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:02.600]
They all fall right to the floor.

[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:03.160]
Yeah, of course.

[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:07.860]
And it's, oh, well, I just wanted to throw that in.

[01:13:08.020 --> 01:13:09.620]
Well, thank God you've been healed my son.

[01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:10.740]
God, but I'll pray for you.

[01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:11.360]
Is George there?

[01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:11.940]
He's there.

[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:12.000]

[01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:12.300]
I left.

[01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:14.000]
George, I like the view from in dead.

[01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:14.720]
I thought it was great.

[01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:15.300]
Okay.

[01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:17.260]
Had a few plot holes in it, but I ain't going to go.

[01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:17.860]
I ain't going to go.

[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:18.000]

[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:18.240]

[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:19.020]
I'll tell you that.

[01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:19.300]
I'll tell you that.

[01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:21.720]
I'll tell you that.

[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:25.040]
Benny, you ain't lived until you seen Benny Hinn.

[01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:29.720]
In fact, I'd rather see Benny Hinn than go to Benny Hanon having to throw some of them knives at me.

[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:30.960]
Like going to OJ's house.

[01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:33.580]
5, 6, 7, that will be interesting.

[01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:39.340]
I wanted to see whether the least popular athlete would be, I don't think very bonds even give OJ a run for the money.

[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:39.800]
Do you, George?

[01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:40.160]
No.

[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:41.160]
Not even close.

[01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:43.000]
OJ will be tripled digits in the world.

[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:43.840]
Not even close.

[01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:46.040]
OJ, OJ by himself, I have like 25.

[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:49.660]
That matter of fact, if you really want to be scientific, you should just leave OJ out of there.

[01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:50.200]
No.

[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:51.560]
No, no.

[01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:54.000]
No, see what you want to do is make Barry Barnes a winner.

[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.320]
So just leave OJ and say, see, yeah, you.

[01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:57.340]
I don't even know who that is.

[01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:01.760]
You wouldn't know Barry Barnes from Gary U.S. bonds, okay?

[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:03.360]
For James Bond's rights.

[01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:04.820]
W.C.Y. and Hello.

[01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:07.500]
Yes, sir.

[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:08.400]
Dale.

[01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:09.040]
Yeah.

[01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:10.380]
What's wrong with him?

[01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:11.460]
How are you doing?

[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:14.080]
Listen, I got a 4L sky report.

[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:14.800]
Yeah.

[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:15.700]
I don't know.

[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:17.120]
Are you still hanging out with him?

[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:18.140]
I mean, something with him himself.

[01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:19.440]
I never hung out already.

[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:20.180]
I'm not going to be able to do it.

[01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:20.180]

[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:25.920]
I'm not going to be able to do it.

[01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:24.420]
I forgot what the name of the book is, but some guy was involved in his quote and quote and quote.

[01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:28.620]
And he says, that guy is a money loving greedy S.O.B.

[01:17:28.740 --> 01:17:29.160]
You know what I mean?

[01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:31.040]
He has all he cares about.

[01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:31.620]
Of course.

[01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:33.280]
It's all he cares about.

[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:33.880]
You can tell.

[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:37.760]
He's dying in his rings and his bracelets and the Rolex watches.

[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:41.240]
Well, that's why he's always smiling though because he's business is good.

[01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:41.920]
Exactly.

[01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:42.900]
And I have a request.

[01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:44.560]
Anything from Paul Harvey, Neil.

[01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:45.280]
Okay, sir.

[01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:45.940]
Thank you, sir.

[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:46.480]
See you.

[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:48.060]
Yeah, for real.

[01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:49.360]
I mean, it's not, again, not personal.

[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:50.940]
I don't even know him that well.

[01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:53.980]
I mean, he's one of those people you couldn't get him to stand still long enough to like having

[01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:55.900]
an intelligent conversation or even a stupid conversation.

[01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:58.900]
I mean, he was exactly the same off the earth.

[01:17:59.000 --> 01:17:59.680]
He is on the earth.

[01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:00.240]
No difference.

[01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:02.780]
And the thing that really gets me is like the beast.

[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:03.880]
Who's the other one?

[01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:05.380]
They go when he was in Atlanta.

[01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:08.960]
Well, the beast was Atlanta for some ballgame and they stopped by and hung out with

[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:09.300]
for real.

[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:10.300]
Well, what's that all about?

[01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:13.520]
Wasn't for all the one that was always talking about how he wanted him off of his show

[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:15.300]
and he was the one that just like with Moe.

[01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:16.040]
You know, it was the same thing.

[01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:19.540]
Oh, every, every problem he had, every failure was because of the beast and get him out.

[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:21.060]
Wasn't that the right just dreaming that?

[01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:21.680]
I don't know.

[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:22.660]
I don't remember that.

[01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:24.840]
What have anything to do with drugs, would it?

[01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:26.080]
Oh, here's what it says.

[01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:28.480]
Morris bars do not have shredded corbohogat that's straightened out.

[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:29.000]
It's my own.

[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:30.280]
It's my own baby.

[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:31.920]
Big heaving mounds.

[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:35.360]
On that note, how about a future poll for what you're all time favorite candy bars?

[01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:36.260]
How much they're living?

[01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:37.260]
How we've done?

[01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:39.140]
Yeah.

[01:18:39.460 --> 01:18:40.540]
Now, there is something.

[01:18:40.660 --> 01:18:42.060]
Okay, see Tom, little Tommy.

[01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:43.640]
It's not just that polls are boring.

[01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:44.800]
It all depends on what they're all about.

[01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:46.160]
But what a guy goes on to hear.

[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:47.880]
It says, anybody got a new watch?

[01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:49.420]
Anybody buy an interesting watch?

[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:51.260]
Or how about that Milky Way dark?

[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:53.320]
Let's talk about that for three hours.

[01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:55.760]
This is the new Roger.

[01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:58.760]
God, talk about coma inducing.

[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:03.840]
Give me, but I do believe that's just S.

[01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:04.980]
Good morning, Americans.

[01:19:05.260 --> 01:19:06.180]
It's Paul Harvey.

[01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:07.920]
Stand by for news.

[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:11.060]
Bill and his wife Buffy were sitting in church.

[01:19:11.340 --> 01:19:13.180]
Bill sleeping, Buffy, nitting.

[01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:16.360]
The priest asked who created the earth and man.

[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:20.500]
A Buffy poked Bill with her knitting needle and Bill screamed God.

[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:23.320]
The priest looked at him and said, that's right.

[01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:25.640]
Then he asked, who is God's son?

[01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:28.620]
Once more, Buffy poked her husband.

[01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:32.100]
Then Bill, with her needle, he screamed Jesus again.

[01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:33.240]
The priest said correct.

[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:38.220]
Finally, the priest asked, what did he say to Adam when she didn't want anymore children?

[01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:42.280]
Well, Buffy poked her husband Bill again, but this time he screamed,

[01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:45.120]
poked me with that thing one more time and I'm going to rip it off.

[01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:46.880]
The priest said that's right.

[01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:47.960]
Paul Harvey.

[01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:48.720]
Good day.

[01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:49.460]
Good day.

[01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:52.240]
11.45, boy. It's a good thing we don't hear from him much anymore.

[01:19:52.460 --> 01:19:52.680]
You know what?

[01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:54.400]
You'd probably be our committance sausages.

[01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:56.000]
Paul, are you kidding?

[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.280]
He's felt the middle of the pack with this crowd we have.

[01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:00.140]
That's right. He's one of our better colors.

[01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:01.700]
Hey, little Tommy, there's a...

[01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:02.800]
That's not an invitation though.

[01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:03.660]
That's not an invitation.

[01:20:04.260 --> 01:20:05.160]
He'll be on there.

[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:08.980]
ACLU AIDS pastor called in gay sexting.

[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:11.280]
Oh, this must be a mistake. More proper gander.

[01:20:11.780 --> 01:20:15.320]
The American Civil liberties unit is championing the cause of a Southern Baptist minister,

[01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:20.800]
arrested noctua homocity for inviting a male undercover officer to join him in his hotel room for oral sex.

[01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:23.720]
Maybe he was going to go to oral Roberts University.

[01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:24.460]
That could be.

[01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:29.460]
The Reverend Lonnie Luke Latham 60 was charged with a single Mr. Meenor kind of ludeness last month

[01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:32.140]
after propositioning an officer in a hotel parking lot.

[01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:38.700]
Latham had been a public opponent of the same sex marriage and urged gay men and lesbians to change their sexual orientation with the help of Jesus Christ.

[01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:39.840]
Oh, yeah.

[01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:44.320]
Although Latham has pleaded not guilty and insisting that he was attempting to minister to the undercover policeman,

[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.480]
he was just going to minister to him.

[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:48.400]
He was going to give him an oral presentation.

[01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:49.540]
He was going to administer.

[01:20:49.540 --> 01:20:53.540]
He also filed a motion last week to dismiss the case based on constitutional arguments.

[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:56.600]
And a separate friend of the court briefed the same day.

[01:20:56.700 --> 01:21:04.400]
The ACLU argued that Oklahoma's ludeness statue is overly broad and complicit with the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling striking Sodomy laws in Lawrence, versus Texas.

[01:21:05.140 --> 01:21:12.440]
In that case, the High Court extended the right to privacy to encompass private, consensual, and non-commercial adult sex, including homosexual sex.

[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:17.540]
The Oklahoma ludeness statue didn't turn out laws, the giving or receiving of the body for indiscriminate sexual intercourse,

[01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:24.780]
filatio-cutdling, masturbation, anal intercourse, or lascivious lustful or all-ascension conduct with any person not his or her spouse.

[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:25.960]
Good God, what a catalog.

[01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:27.480]
Sure is, it covers a lot.

[01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:29.320]
So there you go.

[01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:38.340]
Of course, to show you all you closet, closet queens out there, all you closet pastors, especially you saw the backties, don't be going in pedaling or buying wears in Oklahoma.

[01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:43.600]
Here comes Farma Height 9-11, controversial filmmaker Michael Moore is targeting the drug companies.

[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:50.780]
Send me your healthcare stories, reads the appeal, the stark request, heads a letter from Michael Moore, the controversial filmmaker published on his website last month,

[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:56.360]
which asks for real life examples of people's bad experiences of hospitals, insurance companies, and drug makers.

[01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:59.080]
Sounds to me like kind of a remake of hospital with George C. Scott.

[01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:01.440]
Yeah, except this one ain't going to be a drama.

[01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:02.880]
No, it's going to be a tragedy.

[01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:05.740]
Right, well, I'm the medical care and the murder of his a tragedy.

[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:10.240]
Renowned for his documentary, Farma Height 9-11, which he took on the Bush administration of the Warnarack.

[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:18.080]
Moore's latest target is the healthcare industry and long overdue work on the film, which is called SICO, has been in progress since 2004,

[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:23.280]
and it's finally expected to be premier later this year, but already speculation about his content has split the industry on the offensive.

[01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:26.460]
They're pretty offensive, all right, because most of you doctors are butchers.

[01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:28.400]
Well, let me give you an educated guess.

[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:29.940]
You couldn't diagnose a hangmail.

[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:34.800]
If executives at healthcare companies where they might come off badly in the film, Moore's letter leaves little doubt.

[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:40.340]
Have you ever found yourself getting ready to file for bankruptcy because you can't pay your kids' hospital bill, and then you say to yourself,

[01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:42.660]
boy, I sure would like to be in Michael Moore's healthcare movie?

[01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:50.340]
Moore says he'll read every letter if you've been abused in any way by this sick greedy, grubby system, and it's caused you where your loved one's great sorrow and pain.

[01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:51.140]
Let me know what he says.

[01:22:51.660 --> 01:22:57.860]
Exactly as in the West of the fourth coming film is a cause for concern, but most are resigned to the fact that Moore is unlikely to take a balanced approach.

[01:22:58.280 --> 01:22:58.840]
Oh, geez.

[01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:08.120]
The film is a concern, but Michael Moore has very little credibility with mainstream Americans as Ken Johnson, the senior vice president of the trade group pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of America.

[01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:13.720]
For every horror story, Michael Moore produces, we can produce a thousand success stories, but he's not interested in them.

[01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:17.140]
Nevertheless, however, it's just not Moore's on the attack.

[01:23:17.420 --> 01:23:24.160]
Other films such as The Constant Gardener, all what a piece of garbage based on the novel by John LaCarrie about the corruption in the industry in Africa,

[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:32.480]
which one, Britain's Rachel Weiss and Oscar is best supporting actress last month, and the book Hardsell, the evolution of a Viagra salesman by a former Pfizer employee,

[01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:34.340]
who only edited the industry's woes.

[01:23:34.580 --> 01:23:37.280]
Woe is me, Melvin's Woe, with Joe Mars Jr.

[01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:45.840]
Actual drug scandal, such as withdrawal by Merck of Viox, its pain reliever two years ago, after concerns about side effects on which has triggered widespread litigation against the company,

[01:23:46.220 --> 01:23:47.880]
haven't helped the industry's relations with the public.

[01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:54.320]
Most executives start to think that Tracer Edford's on the payroll across the street, just odd, I mean, the middle of this story.

[01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:59.540]
Most executives privately admit that industry still has problems communicating what it does, that it's not just playing greedy.

[01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:08.760]
According to Johnson, unrelated to Moore's film, the industry itself has become more aggressive and responding to criticism, and of course, in buying all those spots on the evening news every night, between 6.30 and 7.

[01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:11.060]
One after the other after the other, you notice that?

[01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:11.560]
I did.

[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:14.580]
Every single night, just one after the other.

[01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:16.060]
I asked you a doctor about Levitra.

[01:24:16.860 --> 01:24:20.320]
I asked you a doctor about the crestor, and oh, on and on.

[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:23.340]
Among other things, the Association has signed Montel Williams.

[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:24.800]
Oh, God.

[01:24:25.220 --> 01:24:29.980]
And any award when he's syndicated tacos to promote awareness of existing drug assistance programs.

[01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:36.060]
The efforts have paid off, according to Johnson, the past six months, the industry has improved its favorability rating from 45 to 54%.

[01:24:36.660 --> 01:24:38.240]
They just turn the numbers around, that's all.

[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:40.300]
Companies have also become more proactive.

[01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:50.240]
Blackstone Smith Klein, your of his biggest drug producer, for example, has launched a value of medicine campaign under which its sales representatives are encouraged to promote positive aspects of the industry, like not everybody's dead yet.

[01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:58.420]
A spokesman says the thinking behind the campaign was put in place before the reform of the Medicare system, the state-run system which provides coverage for the elderly, which took effect this year.

[01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:01.920]
Blackstone Smith Klein has also launched a new ad campaign in the US.

[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:10.320]
Catch lines such as, it's easier to put someone on the moon than develop a drug, and today's medicine's finance tomorrow's miracles are decided to promote awareness of the work drug companies do.

[01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:16.120]
Right. And all the money that they're paying, the detail men are paying to the doctors so they can poison you and kill you in early age.

[01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:17.100]
All of these things.

[01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:18.800]
Can't wait for sicko.

[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:21.360]
Although I think we hear from them every day, don't we?

[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:23.160]
879 votes on the pool.

[01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:25.440]
We got a little battle here to get to 1,000 only.

[01:25:25.740 --> 01:25:26.280]
Not really.

[01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:29.200]
Who is the greatest baseball player of all time?

[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:31.120]
Babe Ruth 178.

[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:32.800]
I hate baseball 144.

[01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:34.760]
Willie May is 148.

[01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:36.360]
What kind of pansy's hate baseball?

[01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:37.800]
I hate baseball now.

[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:40.420]
Or I'm not going to say I hate it, but I'm just having no interest in now.

[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:44.940]
But I mean, what kind of a person like over the age of like other than George who's just a hard ass?

[01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:45.580]
I don't hate baseball.

[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:46.940]
And I didn't go see there you go.

[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:48.040]
He wouldn't vote for that.

[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:49.660]
How was a fine player in my day?

[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:50.360]
Well, there you go.

[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:51.220]
What's the hate?

[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:53.300]
As kids growing up, most of us like baseball.

[01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:57.600]
And then of course we got the sour on it because of the money and the greed and the watering down.

[01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:01.540]
And then I'll be because of all the expansion or you realize the boring to watch other people play that.

[01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:04.260]
I mean, you don't want to see the Paduca pirates, right?

[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:05.600]
Willie May is 114.

[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:07.380]
In fact, who wants to see the Pittsburgh pirates?

[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:08.320]
Obviously not too many.

[01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:09.480]
I hate this pool 90.

[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:12.400]
10,75, the splendid spitter.

[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:15.980]
Hank Aaron 62, Mickey Mendel 43, P. Rose 40.

[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:19.120]
Barry Vaughan still in Pete's wake.

[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:20.460]
Barry Vaughan's 36.

[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:22.620]
In fact, he's much closer to the bottom.

[01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:23.500]
He is near the top.

[01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:27.640]
Joe to Maggio 33, it's the battle between Barry and the Jolton Joe.

[01:26:28.060 --> 01:26:33.520]
Lou Gehrig 22, Tai Cobb 22, and Roberto Clemente, Solimente Vente, only 20.

[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:36.480]
These people just have, they have no passion, you know, that's his problem.

[01:26:36.700 --> 01:26:37.580]
How many times have I said that?

[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:38.720]
Just this hour?

[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:39.640]
Five, third, and mid.

[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:43.080]
South Florida, the place with no passion of Talbotov Pinty like Jean Pintny would say.

[01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:44.100]
Oh, we're not going to hear that.

[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:44.780]
Are we? Please.

[01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:46.460]
I like Jean Pintny a lot though.

[01:26:46.940 --> 01:26:48.340]
Five, six, seven, oh five, sixty.

[01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:49.400]
Talon five.

[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:50.640]
I think he just played it last week.

[01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:51.820]
Don't knock yourself out.

[01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:53.200]
How about 24 hours to Tulsa?

[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:54.500]
How many QAM?

[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:54.700]
Hello.

[01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:55.600]
I don't have it.

[01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:56.460]
It hurts me in love.

[01:26:56.840 --> 01:26:57.240]
Yes sir.

[01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:03.900]
Mars bars exactly like a Snickers bar, except it's got shut up, dragged, uses the bomb and

[01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:04.900]
it's going to be nuts.

[01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:07.020]
And they're awful.

[01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:07.640]
No.

[01:27:08.340 --> 01:27:10.940]
It's not just like a Snickers bar, Snickers bar is loaded with caramel.

[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:12.500]
Mars bar and loaded with caramel.

[01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:14.000]
I think it's not a little caramel.

[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:15.520]
Nothing but a candy bar.

[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:16.740]
No you're right.

[01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:17.880]
It's true to Mars bar.

[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.120]
Although I won't tell you this, the Mars ice cream bar is pretty good.

[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:23.920]
Yeah, actually any of those ice cream bars are better than the actual ice cream.

[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:25.160]
I do actually a candy bar.

[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:30.280]
However, that having been said, the ice creams itself, the candy ice cream, they suck.

[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:31.020]
I would.

[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:33.740]
Well I don't acknowledge the amount of things you do, Neil.

[01:27:34.100 --> 01:27:35.940]
Don't go well believe you don't get it either.

[01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:36.600]
Okay go ahead.

[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:40.780]
They've eaten these suck so he's turned into a little cute, clever little shot.

[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:42.220]
No they're awful.

[01:27:42.820 --> 01:27:46.180]
And the fact of the matter is that briars make most of them and then they're still bad.

[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:48.060]
Now how can briars make bad ice cream?

[01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:48.980]
Isn't it briars that make those?

[01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:50.080]
I don't know.

[01:27:50.460 --> 01:27:52.640]
Like Mars bar ice cream and Snickers are all that.

[01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:54.220]
They say you're going to accuse me of doing this.

[01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:55.500]
You know, you brought it up again.

[01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:56.100]
No, no, no, no.

[01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:59.300]
This is having no impact on my appetite for any of this stuff.

[01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:01.860]
And especially the candy ice creams, they're all garbage.

[01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:03.480]
M and M ice cream have you ever had that?

[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:04.140]
No.

[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:05.920]
Oh after you tell you want to have an M and M.

[01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:08.440]
They are a blue, a blue, a poisoned very animal.

[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:09.320]
Horrible.

[01:28:09.700 --> 01:28:10.220]
Oh look at this.

[01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:11.680]
Work stoppage is over immigration.

[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:13.880]
More protest is going to be too bad.

[01:28:14.260 --> 01:28:16.220]
All you will legal aliens go back where you came from.

[01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:16.600]
Okay.

[01:28:16.980 --> 01:28:18.700]
We're going to put you on a banana barge.

[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:21.360]
Oh there's nothing like a nice banana barge if the dairy queen.

[01:28:21.540 --> 01:28:22.680]
See that guy got me started.

[01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:22.980]
What?

[01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:24.600]
You ever have banana barge?

[01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:26.220]
No, but I'm aware of it.

[01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:30.160]
Yeah, banana barges for those people are such pigs that even banana split isn't big enough for them.

[01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:31.460]
So they have to go to banana barge.

[01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:34.080]
Oh, real porkers out there, you know.

[01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:35.620]
If I must go to the...

[01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:37.140]
They won't have a banana split in a bathtub.

[01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:39.860]
Which is what it's for.

[01:28:40.060 --> 01:28:41.560]
Well, we're going to see it in add facts.

[01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:43.600]
Employment insurance premium refunds.

[01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:46.580]
Oh, what is going on with this one?

[01:28:46.580 --> 01:28:47.080]
You know what?

[01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:53.960]
Next thing you know your neighbor is going to be leaving you religious tracks on your front doorstep, on your stooping the operative word.

[01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:58.060]
Don't you people over there understand there are no Jesus Christers in my house.

[01:28:58.060 --> 01:28:59.980]
Okay, they're not welcome in my house.

[01:29:00.060 --> 01:29:03.140]
Don't you understand nothing is more important than saving your heat and soul?

[01:29:03.380 --> 01:29:04.280]
Oh, God.

[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:05.860]
I can just imagine.

[01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:06.760]
Imagine what?

[01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:07.580]
Because, huh?

[01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:13.660]
Well, because somebody's family was over there visiting for 12 long, excruciating days and just got their ass out of there today.

[01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:18.300]
So the neighbor across the street came over and evidently had a chat with the family.

[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:21.340]
Well, somebody was out there.

[01:29:21.340 --> 01:29:21.480]
Yeah.

[01:29:21.900 --> 01:29:27.220]
Which I guess resulted in those religious tracks being at the family, the fanatical Catholic family.

[01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:28.040]
Oh, boy.

[01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:33.800]
Which I once told the mother the reason that there is a shortage of priests and ethogos because there's a shortage of author boys.

[01:29:35.140 --> 01:29:36.560]
It's funny, because it's true.

[01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:38.200]
It was a great line.

[01:29:38.780 --> 01:29:39.980]
And you're right, it probably is true.

[01:29:40.340 --> 01:29:43.340]
And anyway, 891 votes on the pool.

[01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:45.420]
Who is the greatest baseball player of all time?

[01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:46.780]
I just read this tonight.

[01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:47.580]
Yeah, I just did it.

[01:29:47.740 --> 01:29:50.460]
We don't want to overdo it because then Tom Jickel write a whole column about it.

[01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:52.220]
Oh, you know, see, here's the thing, Tom.

[01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:53.360]
You hate to show now.

[01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:54.040]
You don't like it.

[01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:56.280]
You don't like my reading the bedtime stories on here.

[01:29:56.500 --> 01:30:00.800]
You can't start the fact that it's fact we take better polls than you rat, rotten ass newspaper does.

[01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:02.000]
You can't handle that.

[01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:04.000]
But you don't have the balls to write about.

[01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:08.260]
And here's the guy who said, oh, well, Leo's going to have a tough time or keeping in touch with local.

[01:30:08.260 --> 01:30:10.760]
This man would know local from his ass.

[01:30:11.380 --> 01:30:12.380]
You don't write about local.

[01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:13.600]
I'm not the one that's out of touch.

[01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:14.600]
You're out of touch.

[01:30:15.100 --> 01:30:15.920]
So guess what, Tom?

[01:30:16.220 --> 01:30:16.640]
Touch this.

[01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:19.180]
This is Neil Rogers.

[01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:23.320]
This is 560 QAM.

[01:30:24.980 --> 01:30:29.240]
This mark, Morgan, is the 12 to 1 hour on QAM.

[01:30:39.140 --> 01:30:54.940]
If 9 o'clock on Sunday nights, and I'm going to watch HBO, I'm so tired of desperate housewives with a tea in Carmellacore.

[01:30:57.460 --> 01:31:04.700]
I have had to wait nearly two whole years to see Junior AJ and Metal.

[01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:09.920]
I'm sick of getting screwed when I turn on the tube.

[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:13.180]
And they're playing that dope that was show.

[01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:13.920]
Cheers.

[01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:17.520]
Gumbah, Gumbah, da da da.

[01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:21.520]
Gumbah, da da da.

[01:31:26.140 --> 01:31:30.160]
I waited too long for the soprano's man.

[01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:33.540]
It's time we got on with this thing.

[01:31:34.340 --> 01:31:42.080]
I want to see Pauli and Stylio in the back room of the bottle being.

[01:31:44.460 --> 01:31:48.120]
Been so long since the last episode.

[01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:51.400]
There's so many things I forgot.

[01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:54.600]
Is Christopher on smack?

[01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:59.900]
Cause Adriana got whacked and this Tony still sails us in guts.

[01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:10.180]
So I pick up the latest TV guide and that's when I stop feeling fine.

[01:32:10.940 --> 01:32:15.180]
But Johnny feels bringing back the day goes.

[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:18.780]
He should ever be Sunday at night.

[01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:21.540]
But about bringing fire.

[01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:23.720]
Yeah, it's about bringing time.

[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:25.100]
Bravo to it.

[01:32:25.180 --> 01:32:26.120]
There's StuGots radio.

[01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:27.240]
But that's the wrong one.

[01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:27.940]
That's cross street.

[01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:29.940]
Does he still sail the StuGots?

[01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:31.120]
Oh, good God.

[01:32:31.380 --> 01:32:32.620]
Thank God I never got out of that show.

[01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:34.840]
Do you have no idea how many people asked me.

[01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:35.780]
Do you watch sets of prinos?

[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:36.140]
No.

[01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:37.280]
Yeah.

[01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:39.840]
And based on what you're saying, I'm probably not missing much right now either.

[01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:40.320]
No, at the point.

[01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:41.860]
Although it picked up a lot of times.

[01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:42.420]
How about the potential papers?

[01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:44.100]
Anybody got the financial papers?

[01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:45.000]
Huh?

[01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:47.120]
That's all those time pedicule bits.

[01:32:47.300 --> 01:32:47.680]
All the same.

[01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:49.160]
Probably all him.

[01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:50.800]
97 votes on a pool.

[01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:51.960]
And the most interesting thing to me.

[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:52.840]
Look at it like I told you.

[01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:54.340]
It's very bonds in Jolton Joe.

[01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:55.280]
The Yankee Clipper.

[01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:56.720]
There are nose to nose.

[01:32:57.160 --> 01:33:00.340]
Oh, if somebody wins by a nose, I think it'll be the Yankee Clipper wins that battle.

[01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:01.220]
Norm St. John?

[01:33:01.820 --> 01:33:01.960]
Yeah.

[01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:03.960]
Boy was he, was he ugly or what?

[01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:05.440]
Man, he wasn't just regular ugly.

[01:33:05.620 --> 01:33:08.060]
He was, he had a nose like a rhinoceros.

[01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:08.740]
Jody.

[01:33:09.060 --> 01:33:09.520]
Yes, he did.

[01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:10.560]
He was grotesque.

[01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:12.680]
But he was married to Marilyn Monroe.

[01:33:13.060 --> 01:33:13.520]
Yes, he was.

[01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:16.420]
And a lot of ugly guys too, like Arthur Miller.

[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.100]
Well, it's what she married to, only ugly guys.

[01:33:19.460 --> 01:33:19.600]
Right.

[01:33:19.900 --> 01:33:22.680]
She was never even married to anybody looked like human or like a particular.

[01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:23.200]
It was about the particular.

[01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:24.060]
Zed it.

[01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:25.440]
That's what Bobbi Kennedy said.

[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:25.820]
That's right.

[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:36.000]
1203 at 560 WQA and a top advisor to former HouseWept Tom Delay received more than the third of all the money collected by the U.S. Family Network, a nonprofit organization.

[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:41.240]
The advisor created to promote a pro-family of political agenda in Congress according to groups of counting records.

[01:33:41.780 --> 01:33:42.660]
Oh, God, are they?

[01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:45.040]
They're the stealing and broad daylight, man.

[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:50.480]
Even the biggest brinks robbery of all time never came close to what's going on now in the public is, who do you remember like that?

[01:33:50.820 --> 01:33:52.440]
Public's waxing the supreme or reruns.

[01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:54.600]
Delay's former chief of staff Edward A.

[01:33:54.860 --> 01:33:58.640]
Everyone Buckham, who upcreate the group, our stolen Delays employee and his wife Wendy,

[01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:07.100]
with the principal beneficiaries, the group's $3.02 million in revenue, collecting payments totaling $1.00 million during a five-year period ending in 2001.

[01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:12.260]
The group's revenue was drawn mostly from clients of Republican lobbyist Jack Abramov, according to which records.

[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:20.700]
From an FBI subpoena for the records, it can be inferred that the beer was exploring whether there were links between the payments and favorable legislative treatment by Abramov's clients by Delays' orifice.

[01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:21.600]
Oh, brother.

[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:23.780]
That's all I should just make it up, right?

[01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:25.580]
Just to tell me, Pinko, plot.

[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:28.460]
Two more of Katherine Harris' top employees quit.

[01:34:28.660 --> 01:34:30.300]
Oh, well, she's got a real service.

[01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:31.520]
I hope she just flushes.

[01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:35.160]
She had to take that $10 million and her didn't just flush it down the toilet or give it to us.

[01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:37.800]
We could have a couple of the time with the guaranteed party.

[01:34:38.820 --> 01:34:44.360]
Representative Katherine Harris lost two more top staff members this week, one from her campaign orifice, and one from her congressional orifice.

[01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:49.700]
It's time for me to move on so Leah Pits, the deputy campaign and the finance director of operations for Harris.

[01:34:50.220 --> 01:34:53.560]
Pits is the fourth member of Harris' finance team to leave the staff in the past three months.

[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:56.140]
Leah Pits, I wonder if she's keen to Elijah Pits?

[01:34:56.700 --> 01:35:03.220]
The departures come as Harris tries to rejuvenate her US Senate campaign, which is suffered from slow fundraising, bad poll numbers,

[01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:05.700]
and controversy over illegal campaign contributions.

[01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:10.680]
Since December, the long-boat-key Republican has lost two finance directors and a campaign treasure.

[01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:15.640]
Months earlier, her campaign manager quit, and two pollsters also, VAMUST, with the Moussy Man.

[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:18.660]
Her congressional office lost its second employee in his many weeks.

[01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:24.960]
Deputy Chief of Staff Peggy Evans quit last Thursday, a week after press secretary Kara Bory left after seven months on the job.

[01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:29.100]
Staff turnover has been a problem for her since she was elected to Congress in 2002.

[01:35:29.700 --> 01:35:31.480]
And we still want to know if they still make Clark Boris.

[01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:33.120]
I believe I've already been through this.

[01:35:33.180 --> 01:35:35.200]
Sam, where did you Google Clark Boris? They still make him right?

[01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:37.660]
They do. You just don't see him anywhere. Thank God.

[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:39.280]
Great. You ever had you like Clark Boris?

[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:42.440]
I can't remember the last time I had him, or the first time for that matter.

[01:35:42.700 --> 01:35:45.020]
Yellow raster I have. Right. Yellow raster. They look like.

[01:35:45.340 --> 01:35:46.600]
They got to get to the Clark Boris.

[01:35:47.260 --> 01:35:47.840]
No, I don't think so.

[01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:51.800]
No, they have no peanuts. You know, between you and your damn...

[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:52.720]
I told you to remember?

[01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:56.860]
Oh my God, with your coconut and amaris bar and peanuts in a Clark bar, man.

[01:35:57.080 --> 01:35:57.820]
But you know what you like.

[01:35:58.120 --> 01:35:59.620]
You better get your notes straightened out.

[01:35:59.620 --> 01:35:59.940]
Oh, sir, sir.

[01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:00.960]
They're straight.

[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:02.600]
That's what I thought.

[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:03.200]
That's an arrow.

[01:36:03.620 --> 01:36:05.620]
Man. You better get your nuts in your...

[01:36:06.300 --> 01:36:06.980]
They're in a rig.

[01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:08.020]
Coconut straightened out.

[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:09.440]
But you're coconut straightened out.

[01:36:09.740 --> 01:36:11.080]
I think you've got a problem in your coconut.

[01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:12.460]
Well, sometimes you feel like it is.

[01:36:12.780 --> 01:36:14.860]
Clark Bar, did you Google it? I'm sure they still make it.

[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:15.600]
They still make it.

[01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:16.500]
Well, let's get a bunch.

[01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:17.120]
No.

[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:22.780]
I just approved that I'm not here to try to be a PR man for the Canadian government or the Canadian people.

[01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:25.380]
I would say most of the people here around me are civilized.

[01:36:25.380 --> 01:36:26.780]
They certainly seem to be, but...

[01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:30.920]
But, just to prove that Canadians can be just as barbaric as anybody else,

[01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:33.060]
the annual seal hunt is going on now, eh?

[01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:33.780]
Sick.

[01:36:34.060 --> 01:36:34.980]
Really, really sick.

[01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:37.180]
But you should see some of these...

[01:36:37.180 --> 01:36:40.320]
Oh, God, these new fees, some of these strange people,

[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:43.280]
including some of these frogs that are busy up there hunting the baby seals.

[01:36:43.980 --> 01:36:48.140]
Up to 325,000 young harp seal puffs could be killed in the coming weeks.

[01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:52.640]
Celebrities such as former Beatles, Sir Paul McCartney and his wife have joined animal rights groups

[01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:54.800]
in condemning the colors of barbaric and unnecessary.

[01:36:55.340 --> 01:36:57.980]
Even though you don't like him, you hit him like poison, probably the...

[01:36:57.980 --> 01:36:58.320]
Peta.

[01:36:58.540 --> 01:36:59.520]
People are involved too.

[01:37:00.220 --> 01:37:04.620]
Protesters, the anxious Steve and Harper's have Canada was victim of an international propaganda campaign

[01:37:04.620 --> 01:37:07.060]
and insisted the color be carried out humanely.

[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:07.500]
Right.

[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:08.780]
When you like to get...

[01:37:08.780 --> 01:37:11.580]
If you're going to choose a way of dying, when you like being clubbed to death,

[01:37:11.740 --> 01:37:13.220]
and that a good way to do it, that are a machete.

[01:37:13.780 --> 01:37:15.580]
The color is started with an OJ crap again.

[01:37:15.940 --> 01:37:21.040]
The color which reportedly earns $16.5 million in meat and pelt sales

[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:24.520]
is an important source of income for fishing communities in Quebec and Newfoundland

[01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:27.180]
that have been hit hard by dwindling fish stocks in the Atlantic.

[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:29.900]
The hunt is an annual harvest that's based on economics.

[01:37:30.260 --> 01:37:32.980]
It is harvesting animals on sustainable basis, Roger Simone,

[01:37:33.340 --> 01:37:35.320]
of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans told the BBC.

[01:37:36.140 --> 01:37:39.520]
The Canadian government says the call is also necessary to control CO numbers,

[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:43.600]
saying the CO population is almost 6 million, nearly triple level of the 70s.

[01:37:43.740 --> 01:37:45.000]
Well, how come they don't do that in China?

[01:37:45.780 --> 01:37:45.840]
Huh?

[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:46.680]
That's a good idea.

[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:47.220]
Yeah.

[01:37:47.740 --> 01:37:48.180]
Clubs.

[01:37:48.180 --> 01:37:54.480]
It recently increased the total allowable catch by 5,000 to 325,000 poor widow baby seals.

[01:37:54.900 --> 01:37:58.140]
The first day of the call has begun in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence region in Quebec.

[01:37:58.660 --> 01:38:01.160]
I say let's club their frogs that have this sound like a good idea.

[01:38:01.460 --> 01:38:02.240]
Those French Canadians.

[01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:03.340]
I think we could call them.

[01:38:03.340 --> 01:38:05.520]
On your tea, we could take a vote in South Florida, be unanimous.

[01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:10.100]
Some 90,000 sealed pumps in the air are expected to be killed before the hunt moves on to Newfoundland,

[01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:11.760]
where thousands more will be cold.

[01:38:12.220 --> 01:38:16.340]
Oh, such a sea-killed, cold-sea sounds to say, but cold is so much more antiseptic sounding.

[01:38:16.700 --> 01:38:16.820]
Cold.

[01:38:17.260 --> 01:38:17.540]
That's right.

[01:38:17.540 --> 01:38:19.240]
Well, kuchi kuchi koo, let's call you.

[01:38:19.420 --> 01:38:22.260]
But if we say we're going to kill ya, ah, everybody runs like a bastard.

[01:38:22.860 --> 01:38:27.320]
On the first day, sealers and protesters came face to face, sparking confrontations at one point,

[01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:32.020]
a sealer flung the carcass of a skin seal at an inflatable craft carrying protesters and journalists.

[01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:37.240]
They threw carcasses at our zodiac and became rushing at us in their boat and tried to capsize us in the wake.

[01:38:37.700 --> 01:38:40.060]
Said Rebecca Aldworth of the Humane Society of the United States.

[01:38:41.020 --> 01:38:42.760]
This is standard behavior out here.

[01:38:42.860 --> 01:38:44.480]
The sealers feel that they're completely above the law.

[01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:46.480]
That's behavior spell IOUR, of course.

[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:48.280]
But the sealers say they misunderstood.

[01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:50.280]
Right. They're killing them lightly.

[01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:55.300]
Mark Small, president of the Northeast Coastalist Corporation, has been sealing in Newfoundland waters for about 40 years.

[01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:58.300]
I think the Canadian public realizes these are coastal people.

[01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:03.700]
Yeah, barbarians who live off the sea, depend on the hunting survival of small communities where the fish docks aren't there.

[01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:05.400]
Coastal communities have to live too.

[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:07.980]
Well, I have one question about that. Coastal communities have to live?

[01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:08.620]
Why?

[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:09.840]
Yeah, why is that?

[01:39:10.180 --> 01:39:10.560]
Screw ya.

[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:16.420]
Anyway, Paul McCartney says we're absolutely committed to making sure that this is the last slaughter of baby seals in Canada.

[01:39:16.580 --> 01:39:18.260]
Anyone will ever have to witness, you said.

[01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:19.120]
Well, just don't look.

[01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:24.560]
You're just Canada to consider a win-win plan to win the Huff-Wall Compensating Fisherman for Lost Revenue,

[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:29.320]
some of the campaigner Brigitte Bardot also asked the Canadian government to halt the call earlier this week.

[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:29.780]
The call.

[01:39:30.220 --> 01:39:31.480]
Canada is a rich country.

[01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:37.640]
It doesn't need to sell skin, oil, fat and powdered seal premises to make aphrodisiacs for countries in Asia.

[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:43.160]
You can't continue a genocide of animals like this, the 71-year-old actress said she used to look good a long time ago.

[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:48.820]
But Mr. Harper, who refused to request to meet with Bardot, dismissed this suggestion, because she's old and saggy.

[01:39:49.220 --> 01:39:50.200]
We don't harvest the pups.

[01:39:50.260 --> 01:39:56.380]
He said referring to an 87-band of killing newborn seals and white coats with white coats pictured many anti-hump posters.

[01:39:57.060 --> 01:40:00.640]
Unfortunately, we're descended with the victim of a bit of an international propaganda campaign.

[01:40:00.820 --> 01:40:04.200]
He said, we believe the country's acting responsibly will make sure all rules are enforced.

[01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:07.920]
You butcher your murder, that's another thing he's got in common with George Bush, Stephen Harper.

[01:40:08.220 --> 01:40:10.080]
Another butcher, which is blood on his hands.

[01:40:10.420 --> 01:40:14.160]
Only his case is baby seal blood, and in George Bush's case it's human blood.

[01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:18.020]
Man, even a Freddy never had as much blood on his head.

[01:40:18.180 --> 01:40:18.700]
Even Jason.

[01:40:18.980 --> 01:40:19.180]
Mother.

[01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:20.680]
Nice hockey match, though.

[01:40:20.980 --> 01:40:21.880]
Never had that much blood.

[01:40:22.380 --> 01:40:24.860]
Even a guy from one of Stranger calls.

[01:40:25.100 --> 01:40:25.840]
I don't know what his name was.

[01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:27.400]
He's a mouse.

[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:29.480]
930 votes on the poll.

[01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:32.480]
The greatest baseball player of all time, Baby Ruth 193.

[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:33.960]
A rose in the baby Ruth.

[01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:35.420]
I can't believe he never heard that record.

[01:40:35.900 --> 01:40:36.540]
No, sorry.

[01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:37.280]
I might have heard it.

[01:40:37.460 --> 01:40:37.780]
I might have heard it.

[01:40:37.780 --> 01:40:38.720]
You're kind of music at all.

[01:40:38.900 --> 01:40:39.220]
That's right.

[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:40.840]
That's right.

[01:40:40.940 --> 01:40:41.580]
Some singing G.

[01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:42.420]
You would have liked it.

[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:42.920]
You would have liked it.

[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:44.140]
The rock and G.

[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:44.800]
Was he good?

[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:45.620]
It was very good.

[01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:49.000]
I thought I'd clip this morning and then look at him.

[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:51.960]
I'm not into reggae really at all, but this is very good news.

[01:40:52.020 --> 01:40:52.980]
I'm only into the gay part.

[01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:54.200]
That's what I heard.

[01:40:55.140 --> 01:40:55.880]
I'll take a break.

[01:40:55.940 --> 01:40:57.040]
What's the spaxi disemnely here?

[01:40:57.200 --> 01:40:59.520]
It says, I saw your poll although I'm a lifelong Yankee fan.

[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:00.880]
The only right answer is Ted Williams.

[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:02.420]
The splendid spitter.

[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:06.360]
And like I said last week, I have so much more respect for him now when I read those stories

[01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:10.640]
about how he's to spend a spare time shooting pigeons in Fenway Park with a BB gun.

[01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:13.060]
Nothing more annoying than a pigeon plus the Pus A.

[01:41:13.220 --> 01:41:14.680]
He might have saved us from the bird flu.

[01:41:15.140 --> 01:41:15.780]
You realize that?

[01:41:16.300 --> 01:41:16.840]
That's too bad.

[01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:17.900]
He had a good head on his shoulders.

[01:41:18.340 --> 01:41:21.180]
He missed five and a half prime seasons due to WW2 in Korea.

[01:41:21.180 --> 01:41:21.920]
He volunteered.

[01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:22.860]
He didn't have to go back.

[01:41:23.140 --> 01:41:26.080]
If not for that, add 200 plus home runs to his 530 something.

[01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:27.440]
And he's the all-time leader.

[01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:32.980]
He retired in 1962 after hitting 325 lifetime in home runs and maybe everything else that says.

[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:37.640]
By the way, Babe Ruthik Horner's official biography was a catcher until what we didn't want to get personal.

[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:42.060]
Until sometimes to clear a little high school, he grew up in an orphanage for boys who couldn't be controlled by his parents.

[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:44.620]
So we also played that position so that Josh is right.

[01:41:45.020 --> 01:41:47.620]
He was a catcher, first base, pitcher and right fielder.

[01:41:47.860 --> 01:41:52.360]
Yeah, how many positions are very bond plates have been he over in the Alachor and Prudisteroid shot in his face?

[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:54.620]
How many positions he played?

[01:41:55.580 --> 01:41:55.980]
Josh.

[01:41:59.220 --> 01:42:00.120]
What is he doing?

[01:42:00.740 --> 01:42:00.920]
Oh my.

[01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:02.340]
He's starting to come up with a good answer.

[01:42:02.340 --> 01:42:03.120]
How many?

[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:04.900]
I'm going to cut up answers here.

[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:06.420]
Solomon, well why is it going on?

[01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:08.260]
You just decided that's the end of the quiz.

[01:42:09.020 --> 01:42:09.820]
There's no quiz.

[01:42:10.020 --> 01:42:11.540]
Look, because you don't have any answers.

[01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:13.180]
That's what I have my opinion.

[01:42:13.460 --> 01:42:14.880]
It's going to get a chance of your opinion.

[01:42:14.980 --> 01:42:19.140]
I think Babe Ruth was definitely ahead of his five-year shot.

[01:42:19.540 --> 01:42:21.740]
He will agree with the very bonds as the greatest baseball player.

[01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:24.220]
It's laughable on the face of this laughable.

[01:42:24.220 --> 01:42:27.540]
It will be like saying that Mario Mendoza was the greatest baseball player.

[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:28.340]
You know what?

[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:29.420]
It's just silly.

[01:42:29.700 --> 01:42:30.620]
No, it's not silly.

[01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:31.540]
It's silly.

[01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:34.600]
It will be like saying Mark McGwire was the greatest baseball player of all time.

[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:36.440]
Oh, it's not even close to for Sammy Sosa.

[01:42:36.900 --> 01:42:39.080]
You didn't hear the stat that I gave you.

[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:40.180]
I'm a huge Miami of the...

[01:42:40.180 --> 01:42:42.040]
I keep getting him confused with what's his name?

[01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:43.080]
500-500.

[01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:44.660]
Who's the one that did I love you Miami?

[01:42:45.220 --> 01:42:46.460]
That's Levant Hernandez.

[01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:47.380]

[01:42:47.660 --> 01:42:48.000]

[01:42:49.500 --> 01:42:51.640]
Zog into the song about him.

[01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:54.760]
You know, he walked almost a thousand times more than Babe Ruth.

[01:42:55.140 --> 01:42:55.340]
Yeah.

[01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:57.020]

[01:42:57.020 --> 01:42:58.360]
Well, that's because he's doing what he's doing.

[01:42:58.360 --> 01:42:58.380]
He's doing what he's doing.

[01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:00.280]

He's doing what he's doing.

[01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:02.160]
He's doing what he's doing.

[01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:02.920]
He's doing what he's doing.

[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:05.580]
He's doing what he's doing.

[01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:14.720]

Bobby Bond is good.

[02:06:02.840 --> 02:06:03.420]
He's a ball player.

[02:06:03.520 --> 02:06:05.000]
Now, he wasn't the greatest player of all time.

[02:06:05.200 --> 02:06:05.680]
No, he wasn't.

[02:06:05.680 --> 02:06:07.740]

Now, like Layton Hewitt is on here.

[02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:11.900]

[02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:15.440]
You know who that is?

[02:06:15.680 --> 02:06:17.360]

[02:06:17.560 --> 02:06:19.680]

[02:06:19.680 --> 02:06:21.000]
Layton Hewitt's a tennis player.

[02:06:21.060 --> 02:06:21.660]

[02:06:21.660 --> 02:06:22.380]
He's from down under.

[02:06:22.700 --> 02:06:22.880]
No.

[02:06:23.520 --> 02:06:25.260]
I'd heard, but what's the reason for that?

[02:06:25.540 --> 02:06:26.020]
Oh, I don't.

[02:06:26.160 --> 02:06:27.900]

[02:06:43.260 --> 02:06:43.440]
Did we?

[02:06:43.720 --> 02:06:44.640]
Why would we do that on baseball?

[02:06:44.900 --> 02:06:45.620]
We're not doing athletes.

[02:06:45.840 --> 02:06:46.220]
We're doing...

[02:06:46.220 --> 02:06:46.740]
Oh, I see.

[02:06:46.900 --> 02:06:47.560]
Yeah, come on there.

[02:06:47.560 --> 02:06:48.040]
Sorry.

[02:06:48.300 --> 02:06:49.460]
I'm going to start talking to that.

[02:06:49.880 --> 02:06:51.380]
Ricky Williams was on one of the lists.

[02:06:51.480 --> 02:06:55.920]
I put him on there, even though he won't do well in South Florida, because again, he's considered, you know, at the firm running Fony crowd.

[02:06:56.300 --> 02:06:57.820]
All the most of us aren't dolphin fans anyway.

[02:06:58.200 --> 02:06:58.740]
Michael Irvin.

[02:06:59.120 --> 02:06:59.840]
That's the...

[02:06:59.840 --> 02:07:00.760]
Can't take this scum.

[02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:01.320]
You...

[02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:02.220]
You won't want to scum.

[02:07:02.420 --> 02:07:02.960]
Oh, how about...

[02:07:02.960 --> 02:07:03.920]
How about Keeshawn Johnson?

[02:07:04.900 --> 02:07:05.960]
Keeshawn despised by all.

[02:07:06.180 --> 02:07:07.460]
And what kind of a name is that anyway?

[02:07:08.240 --> 02:07:08.880]
Keeshawn Johnson.

[02:07:09.560 --> 02:07:09.980]
I just...

[02:07:09.980 --> 02:07:11.420]
These names just send me right to the bull.

[02:07:11.820 --> 02:07:13.480]
Maybe that's why George was running this morning.

[02:07:13.760 --> 02:07:14.820]
Maybe he had to do a Keeshawn.

[02:07:14.840 --> 02:07:16.480]
Hey, I just did an on-cord during that last break.

[02:07:16.480 --> 02:07:17.580]
No, get out of here.

[02:07:17.680 --> 02:07:18.560]
An on-cord performance.

[02:07:18.780 --> 02:07:19.040]
That's right.

[02:07:19.140 --> 02:07:20.060]
Standing ovation, too.

[02:07:20.240 --> 02:07:21.580]
And I heard it was an open house.

[02:07:23.600 --> 02:07:24.520]
Now, here's a good idea.

[02:07:24.600 --> 02:07:26.040]
This might brighten your day, George.

[02:07:26.220 --> 02:07:27.100]
Here's an idea for you.

[02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:27.460]
All right.

[02:07:27.980 --> 02:07:34.600]
A Muslim couple in New Delhi, India, have been told by local Islamic leaders they must separate after the husband divorced his wife in his sleep.

[02:07:35.380 --> 02:07:38.400]
So, Hila, I'm sorry, told friends that her husband, Aftah.

[02:07:38.460 --> 02:07:38.680]
Wait a minute.

[02:07:38.760 --> 02:07:39.180]
All right.

[02:07:39.240 --> 02:07:39.660]
I got my gun.

[02:07:39.880 --> 02:07:40.740]
How did this...

[02:07:40.740 --> 02:07:41.560]
Her husband...

[02:07:42.520 --> 02:07:45.160]
As soon as I saw this story, I knew who I thought of.

[02:07:45.400 --> 02:07:49.220]
Her husband, Aftah, been under the word Talak or divorce three times in his sleep.

[02:07:49.260 --> 02:07:49.560]
Talak?

[02:07:50.020 --> 02:07:50.420]
Talak.

[02:07:50.500 --> 02:07:51.300]
T-A-L-A-Q.

[02:07:51.540 --> 02:07:52.220]
T-A-O-K.

[02:07:52.660 --> 02:07:53.480]
I don't know what's that really.

[02:07:53.840 --> 02:07:54.620]
T-A-L-A-Q.

[02:07:54.940 --> 02:07:55.960]
You know what I mean?

[02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:56.400]
Talak.

[02:07:56.700 --> 02:07:57.980]
A court published in newspapers today.

[02:07:58.380 --> 02:07:59.400]
I know you like it a lot.

[02:07:59.980 --> 02:08:00.560]
When local Islamists got...

[02:08:01.500 --> 02:08:05.560]
When you listen to this, when local Islamic leaders got to hear they said Aftah,

[02:08:05.560 --> 02:08:08.560]
the people who were forced to divorce under the word Talak,

[02:08:09.380 --> 02:08:10.040]
they said,

[02:08:12.420 --> 02:08:20.540]
the people who were forced to divorce under the word Talak,

[02:08:20.540 --> 02:08:20.700]
they said, the people who were forced to divorce under the word Talak,

[02:08:20.700 --> 02:08:20.800]
they said, the people who were forced to divorce under the word Talak,

[02:08:20.800 --> 02:08:20.820]
they said, the people who were forced to divorce under the word Talak,

[02:08:20.820 --> 02:08:21.680]
they said, the people who were forced to divorce under the word Talak,

[02:08:21.680 --> 02:08:24.720]
they said, the people who were forced to divorce under the word Talak,

[02:08:24.720 --> 02:08:26.620]
they said, the people who were forced to divorce under the word Talak,

[02:08:26.620 --> 02:08:29.880]
they said, the people who were forced to divorce under the word Talak,

[02:08:30.900 --> 02:08:35.540]
they said, the people who were forced to divorce under the word Talak,

[02:08:35.540 --> 02:08:36.720]
they said, there is divorce in property and herds.

[02:08:37.220 --> 02:08:40.260]
This is a totally unnecessary controversy in the local community leaders

[02:08:40.260 --> 02:08:42.920]
or whosoever said, our totally ignorant of Islamic law

[02:08:42.920 --> 02:08:45.740]
said, Zarafool Islam Khan and Islamist scholar,

[02:08:46.020 --> 02:08:48.240]
editor of the Millig widgets a popular Muslim newspaper,

[02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:51.360]
thought my mother wrote that, the Millig widgets the law clearly says

[02:08:51.360 --> 02:08:54.220]
any action under compulsion in the state of intoxication has no effect.

[02:08:54.600 --> 02:08:56.200]
The case is someone uttering something while will sleep

[02:08:56.200 --> 02:08:57.240]
fall under this category.

[02:08:57.520 --> 02:08:59.660]
We'll have no impact whatsoever, consult over it.

[02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:01.280]
You give it a try, I can't hurt,

[02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:03.960]
what if you're sober conscience, and then stand on the roof and eat well,

[02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:05.520]
yeah, you and your awakensake should be really careful,

[02:09:05.520 --> 02:09:08.960]
screaming it outside the front door to lock make sure everybody in the hood hears it

[02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:12.020]
in fact i think we're my house in stand the front door and here it in case it was

[02:09:12.020 --> 02:09:12.180]
a

[02:09:12.180 --> 02:09:17.500]
with a crazy uh... jesus books go away and stop polluting my doorstep with your

[02:09:17.500 --> 02:09:19.740]
garbage okay you crazy people you

[02:09:20.700 --> 02:09:24.320]
thousand twenty one on votes on the pool in very bans is much closer to the bottom

[02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:27.360]
in the top that's bad news for drash well they don't know not

[02:09:27.920 --> 02:09:30.660]
no i just did they just don't agree they could all be wrong

[02:09:30.660 --> 02:09:31.420]
and they are

[02:09:32.320 --> 02:09:33.560]
and i think they're all wrong

[02:09:33.560 --> 02:09:35.280]
uh... right

[02:09:35.820 --> 02:09:39.160]
just like george borses the rest of the world is out of step on on the man

[02:09:39.160 --> 02:09:39.800]
i'm a man

[02:09:40.380 --> 02:09:40.820]
right

[02:09:40.820 --> 02:09:41.800]
for me once

[02:09:42.240 --> 02:09:46.320]
researchers say they've created clone piglets that are rich in omega-3 fatty

[02:09:46.320 --> 02:09:48.880]
acids and all of this prices been beneficial to the heart

[02:09:48.880 --> 02:09:52.800]
all of that were little pig sitting on top of its pen of the farm

[02:09:53.340 --> 02:09:55.600]
what those are the ugliest animals you know what

[02:09:55.600 --> 02:09:56.320]
what they got

[02:09:56.320 --> 02:09:57.180]
pigs

[02:09:57.180 --> 02:09:58.740]
have you seen a plot of the mean

[02:09:58.740 --> 02:10:00.800]
well i mean even like other other

[02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:04.180]
other animals that are very attracted to the well i guess a hippo eight so that

[02:10:04.180 --> 02:10:04.680]
yeah

[02:10:04.680 --> 02:10:06.480]
right off the rest

[02:10:07.180 --> 02:10:07.620]
but yeah

[02:10:07.620 --> 02:10:12.100]
little rino is a probably for the other scene anteater lately omega-3 yes in one

[02:10:12.100 --> 02:10:12.920]
in a movie

[02:10:13.460 --> 02:10:17.580]
omega-3 is mostly found in fish for this applies threatened by overtrawling

[02:10:17.580 --> 02:10:20.360]
and crowded by words about mercury pollution which accumulates in fish

[02:10:20.360 --> 02:10:20.780]
livers

[02:10:20.780 --> 02:10:21.980]
oh god

[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:25.720]
a team led by you find i have the university of Pittsburgh school medicine

[02:10:25.720 --> 02:10:28.920]
transferred to the fetal pig cells a gene called fat one

[02:10:28.920 --> 02:10:33.000]
that have been identified in a well studied lab animal tiny worm known as

[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:34.000]
something something

[02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:36.520]
can't cano horror elegans

[02:10:36.520 --> 02:10:37.320]
cano horror

[02:10:37.320 --> 02:10:41.720]
fat one converts the abundant policy is a rebel omega-6 fatty acids in the

[02:10:41.720 --> 02:10:42.840]
coveted omega-3

[02:10:42.840 --> 02:10:46.100]
the nucleus of pig eggs was then removed and substitute with the nucleus from

[02:10:46.100 --> 02:10:46.340]
these

[02:10:46.340 --> 02:10:49.740]
engineers cells following the now classic method of animal cloning that began

[02:10:49.740 --> 02:10:50.420]
with dolly

[02:10:50.420 --> 02:10:51.960]
in i-6 and louis Armstrong

[02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:54.340]
with that hanky wiping a sweat off his fat face

[02:10:54.340 --> 02:10:57.640]
research is prime a mistake a better understanding cardiac function

[02:10:57.640 --> 02:10:59.980]
or hogging human are strikingly similar to you know that

[02:10:59.980 --> 02:11:01.080]
well i guess you've seen the

[02:11:01.080 --> 02:11:01.720]
uh...

[02:11:02.420 --> 02:11:03.320]
i did know that

[02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:06.460]
we would use these animals as a model to see what happens to hard health if we

[02:11:06.460 --> 02:11:08.080]
increase the omega-3 levels in the body

[02:11:08.080 --> 02:11:10.700]
it allows to see how that helps cardiovascular function

[02:11:10.700 --> 02:11:14.740]
the headline article says eat bacon made from uh...

[02:11:14.740 --> 02:11:16.200]
baby pig cloned pigs

[02:11:16.780 --> 02:11:19.720]
maybe i've gotten in the morning when i'm i've taken from now i'll have cloned

[02:11:19.720 --> 02:11:20.240]
pig bacon

[02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:21.380]
how's that okay

[02:11:21.380 --> 02:11:22.800]
sounds like a deal to me

[02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:23.780]
you have twice as much

[02:11:23.780 --> 02:11:24.480]
yeah

[02:11:24.480 --> 02:11:25.680]
could you see by the

[02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:27.380]
just show down my goal

[02:11:27.380 --> 02:11:31.380]
five six seven o five sixty pound five sixty in the horizon singular

[02:11:31.380 --> 02:11:32.100]
right this line

[02:11:40.460 --> 02:11:41.240]
we were just

[02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:42.180]
yes sir

[02:11:42.180 --> 02:11:45.680]

[02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:47.780]
thing i would like to make a comment on it

[02:11:47.780 --> 02:11:48.560]
what was the right

[02:11:48.980 --> 02:11:51.300]
you just mentioned something about uh...

[02:11:51.300 --> 02:11:53.040]
house on uh... somebody in the air

[02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:53.680]
the world

[02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:54.120]
uh...

[02:11:54.120 --> 02:11:54.840]

[02:11:54.840 --> 02:11:56.480]
uh... you said it's a

[02:11:56.880 --> 02:11:57.280]
yeah

[02:11:58.100 --> 02:11:59.860]
that's why i'm officially divorced from this call

[02:12:00.280 --> 02:12:01.660]
but he wanted to tell you something

[02:12:01.660 --> 02:12:02.480]
you'll see

[02:12:03.180 --> 02:12:04.940]
five six seven o five sixty

[02:12:04.940 --> 02:12:08.240]
it's the time we only know how much they had a dynamite audience right now

[02:12:08.240 --> 02:12:09.320]
one o'clock in the morning because

[02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:12.200]
if he really did go into that tirade which who the hell knows because it's

[02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:14.020]
just a fact but i do believe it

[02:12:14.020 --> 02:12:16.600]
uh... you know you thought there would be like especially since it was about

[02:12:16.600 --> 02:12:18.600]

r i

[02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:15.840]
come

[02:13:30.600 --> 02:13:31.000]
keyboard

[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:39.380]
un

[02:13:39.380 --> 02:13:41.920]
My eyes get confused

[02:13:41.920 --> 02:13:45.080]
And with the hell's hanging out my nose

[02:13:45.780 --> 02:13:48.420]
My head is still to drop the floor

[02:13:48.420 --> 02:13:51.540]
Don't even have the heck to anymore

[02:13:52.300 --> 02:13:54.680]
What's the top of the coolie over on some?

[02:13:55.780 --> 02:13:58.660]
This isn't a future I'd never come back to go

[02:13:58.660 --> 02:14:01.380]
When you get your license for new

[02:14:01.380 --> 02:14:04.840]
You're trying to know good what you get through

[02:14:04.840 --> 02:14:07.860]
That's just a lady in the DM&D

[02:14:08.860 --> 02:14:11.620]
This is what you're having to say to me

[02:14:11.620 --> 02:14:13.460]
This is so cool

[02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:16.720]
Oh God, why yeah

[02:14:16.720 --> 02:14:20.180]
What does it not fit you even though we're at peace?

[02:14:20.500 --> 02:14:23.540]
My real promise looks like a fake happy

[02:14:23.540 --> 02:14:26.780]
You won't be taking me away

[02:14:26.780 --> 02:14:31.200]
Oh wow, oh wow

[02:14:31.860 --> 02:14:34.020]
My promise looks so different

[02:14:35.180 --> 02:14:37.500]
Every time they begin it's like cry

[02:14:38.380 --> 02:14:40.440]
Every time they begin it's cry

[02:14:42.360 --> 02:14:44.580]
Crap, it's a 101 at 560

[02:14:44.580 --> 02:14:46.840]
We got Curtis coming along at 2 o'clock this afternoon

[02:14:46.840 --> 02:14:49.020]
Mad Dog at the AA, the Mickey Erison's

[02:14:49.540 --> 02:14:50.660]
Flipping the Mickey Arena at 4

[02:14:50.660 --> 02:14:52.220]
Six 30s of Panther preview

[02:14:52.220 --> 02:14:53.780]
Panthers in the Bruins in Boston

[02:14:53.780 --> 02:14:55.040]
at 7 o'clock tonight

[02:14:55.040 --> 02:14:56.520]
They're described their G and the Bruins

[02:14:56.520 --> 02:14:58.020]
And Jesse Aguileref and Hockey

[02:14:58.020 --> 02:14:58.960]
Mr. Hockey Jr.

[02:14:59.540 --> 02:15:01.880]
Let's see, I'm out of, I don't even know what this website is

[02:15:01.880 --> 02:15:03.920]
And I can't figure out, you ever get on a site like that?

[02:15:04.300 --> 02:15:05.640]
It's, I don't know what it is

[02:15:05.640 --> 02:15:06.400]
Just the slaughter

[02:15:06.400 --> 02:15:09.760]
Jurles. And I don't know, it's about the SBL

[02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:12.100]
Who the hell's SBL? Most handed athletes

[02:15:12.720 --> 02:15:14.120]
It's got all these different categories

[02:15:14.120 --> 02:15:16.220]
And I've picked a couple of these out

[02:15:16.220 --> 02:15:17.880]
Of course, there could be Brian, most handed rapist

[02:15:18.720 --> 02:15:20.300]
Peyton Manning, right Josh?

[02:15:20.980 --> 02:15:22.260]
Not that I know, but okay

[02:15:22.260 --> 02:15:22.940]
I hate him

[02:15:22.940 --> 02:15:25.720]
Roger Clemens, fat, big mouth, obnoxious

[02:15:25.720 --> 02:15:26.900]
Retired 400 times

[02:15:27.700 --> 02:15:29.600]
Some of the interesting ones, they're like NCAA

[02:15:29.600 --> 02:15:31.180]
And I'm not putting these on tomorrow

[02:15:31.180 --> 02:15:33.440]
But three most handed figures, NCAA football

[02:15:33.440 --> 02:15:35.760]
Steve Spurrier number one, Bobby Bob number two

[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:38.120]
And Phil Fulmer number three, I don't know who Phil Fulmer is

[02:15:38.120 --> 02:15:38.720]
Who's that?

[02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:40.880]
I know who that is, hold on

[02:15:40.880 --> 02:15:42.160]
I'm holding it

[02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:43.760]
I think he's the head of C coach

[02:15:43.760 --> 02:15:45.400]
I think I'm gonna look it up

[02:15:45.400 --> 02:15:47.380]
NCAA basketball is three most handed figures

[02:15:47.380 --> 02:15:50.700]
Wait to hear who number one, especially the timing is perfect

[02:15:50.700 --> 02:15:52.480]
Dick Vitale is number one

[02:15:52.480 --> 02:15:54.540]
Most handed figure in NCAA basketball

[02:15:54.540 --> 02:15:56.280]
Amen, amen

[02:15:56.280 --> 02:15:56.980]
Baby

[02:15:57.560 --> 02:15:58.920]
Coach K is number two

[02:15:58.920 --> 02:16:00.960]
They don't want to put out your chef's he said they put Coach K

[02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:02.780]
And JJ Redick is number three

[02:16:02.780 --> 02:16:04.800]
And NHL's three most handed players

[02:16:04.800 --> 02:16:07.300]
Well look at that, yeah he's a Tennessee football coach

[02:16:07.300 --> 02:16:09.600]
Todd Bertuzzi, which I put him on our list

[02:16:10.520 --> 02:16:13.000]
Derrius Casparitas and Yarko Routou

[02:16:13.400 --> 02:16:14.840]
Ty don't even need to make the list

[02:16:14.840 --> 02:16:16.660]
And as far as most three handed figures

[02:16:16.660 --> 02:16:18.760]
Kurt Bush is number one and then after that

[02:16:18.760 --> 02:16:19.960]
It says in conclusive, nobody

[02:16:19.960 --> 02:16:22.460]
Now I'm gonna vote, they got their own little poll on here

[02:16:22.460 --> 02:16:24.640]
I'm gonna vote for, well just to make you happy

[02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:25.700]
I'll vote for Dick Vitale

[02:16:25.700 --> 02:16:30.220]
Here's the, it says who is the most hated figures in sports

[02:16:30.220 --> 02:16:33.620]
All sports then the choices are Todd Bertuzzi, Barry Bonds, Kobe Bryant

[02:16:33.620 --> 02:16:36.900]
Kurt Bush, Teraloans, Steve Spurrier, Dick Vitale

[02:16:36.900 --> 02:16:38.540]
Or I'm putting Dick Vitale, okay?

[02:16:38.940 --> 02:16:40.300]
I voted and here's what it is

[02:16:40.300 --> 02:16:41.960]
Or you'll be pleased to know it was close

[02:16:41.960 --> 02:16:43.760]
They got almost 3,000 votes

[02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:48.320]
Teraloans 38%, Barry Bonds 36%, Kobe Bryant 19

[02:16:48.320 --> 02:16:51.100]
And after that small put it is Dick Vitale only 6%.

[02:16:51.100 --> 02:16:53.340]
Well if we're going guys like Dicky V, it's the part

[02:16:53.340 --> 02:16:54.860]
Are we gonna do, no no no

[02:16:55.440 --> 02:16:57.780]
Most of the athlete, he's no athlete

[02:16:57.780 --> 02:17:00.620]
No, God, maybe at the dinner table, that's about it

[02:17:00.620 --> 02:17:01.600]
He's not awesome, baby

[02:17:02.900 --> 02:17:05.320]
Yeah, he's awesome when it comes to being despised

[02:17:05.320 --> 02:17:06.820]
Makes me nauseous, God

[02:17:07.340 --> 02:17:09.840]
And then there's a whole bunch of Dicky V wannabes too

[02:17:09.840 --> 02:17:11.980]
You've noticed that, I don't know what their names are

[02:17:11.980 --> 02:17:12.620]
And who do I care?

[02:17:12.840 --> 02:17:15.720]
Anyway, I looked up Calypkin Jr. and he already has two votes

[02:17:15.720 --> 02:17:18.200]
His lifetime batting average was 276

[02:17:18.200 --> 02:17:19.920]
Which is okay, you know, it's all right

[02:17:19.920 --> 02:17:22.160]
And his lifetime home runs 431

[02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:24.140]
Which again, it's a respectable figure

[02:17:24.140 --> 02:17:25.820]
But certainly doesn't put him anywhere in the category

[02:17:25.820 --> 02:17:28.180]
The only thing he's got going for is he was the Iron Man

[02:17:28.180 --> 02:17:29.440]
That's all I broke who Gary's record

[02:17:29.440 --> 02:17:30.480]
That's just a revolve

[02:17:30.480 --> 02:17:31.600]
And that's it, that's it

[02:17:31.600 --> 02:17:34.560]
Good ball player, solid, I would say he was rock solid

[02:17:34.560 --> 02:17:36.780]
But that's about it, certainly not in the same categories these other

[02:17:36.780 --> 02:17:38.400]
But we put him on, he's got two votes already

[02:17:38.400 --> 02:17:39.320]
Probably relatives

[02:17:40.320 --> 02:17:42.860]
New poll shows that Democrats lead by 9 points

[02:17:42.860 --> 02:17:45.380]
So there's plenty of time between now and elections to blow that

[02:17:45.800 --> 02:17:48.680]
Time magazine survey shows unhappiness with the GOP

[02:17:48.680 --> 02:17:51.380]
But can Democrats translate that into a power shift?

[02:17:51.380 --> 02:17:52.220]
Well, you know them

[02:17:52.220 --> 02:17:56.680]
Like the Leafs in the Canadians last night both desperately trying to blow those leads in the last five minutes

[02:17:57.380 --> 02:17:59.320]
Times latest poll finds American voters heading in

[02:17:59.320 --> 02:18:02.680]
November's election to satisfy with the Republican-dominated status quo

[02:18:02.680 --> 02:18:05.220]
But I'm necessarily convinced the answer lies in voting Democratic

[02:18:05.220 --> 02:18:11.100]
The poll conducted March 22 and 3rd finds Americans unhappy with the performance of the Republican-controlled Congress

[02:18:11.100 --> 02:18:14.540]
39% approve versus 49% who don't

[02:18:14.540 --> 02:18:17.080]
And give the Democrats a 9-poly when voters ask to stay

[02:18:17.080 --> 02:18:19.260]
Which parties candidate they choose for the House

[02:18:19.260 --> 02:18:22.060]
50% said Democrat-41% Republican

[02:18:22.060 --> 02:18:26.760]
Votes favor Democratic-controlled Congress by 49% to 38 who want Republican-controlled

[02:18:26.760 --> 02:18:28.760]
And it goes on but it'll be put there you go

[02:18:28.760 --> 02:18:31.660]
Time magazine for what it's worth about 50%

[02:18:34.700 --> 02:18:37.220]
56670560, 0560 in the Verizon Singular Rival Sline

[02:18:37.220 --> 02:18:39.420]
So here's what I got for tomorrow so far

[02:18:39.420 --> 02:18:42.660]
The athlete, the all-time athlete, you dislike the most pretty big list

[02:18:43.260 --> 02:18:46.060]
OJ Simpson, Pete Rose, Dury Bond, I hate sports, I hate this poll

[02:18:46.060 --> 02:18:49.240]
Kurt Warner, Mark McWire, Jose Conzucco, Raphael Palmer, Owing Gretz,

[02:18:49.240 --> 02:18:53.300]
Gneetlenose, Kobe Bryant, Keeshawn Johnson, Kurt Schilling, Terrell Owens,

[02:18:53.500 --> 02:18:57.960]
Ron Arthest, Ty Dohme, Mike Tyson, Todd Bertuzzi, Brian Cox, John Rocker,

[02:18:58.020 --> 02:19:01.140]
Old John Rocker, Ricky Williams, Michael Irvin, Ray Lewis, Phil McElson,

[02:19:01.460 --> 02:19:04.740]
Peyton Manning, and Roger Clemens, Fat, Roger Clemens

[02:19:04.740 --> 02:19:07.480]
Come on, retire already, Roger, it's enough, enough for the BS

[02:19:07.480 --> 02:19:08.940]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello

[02:19:08.940 --> 02:19:10.980]
People feel the ball with the 20-year-old people

[02:19:10.980 --> 02:19:11.700]
Q-A-M

[02:19:11.700 --> 02:19:15.280]
They're never talking about it, so Korea, they're a, uh, amusement park

[02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:18.080]
And they were 50-nots of people, they were gonna let it all in free

[02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:20.900]
To ride the ride, and all the little kids here have fun

[02:19:20.900 --> 02:19:21.900]
That's for real

[02:19:22.920 --> 02:19:25.700]
Oh, great, that was for real, I'm out of my mind

[02:19:25.700 --> 02:19:26.980]
Yeah, great

[02:19:26.980 --> 02:19:29.840]
W-D-Q-A-M sounds the same as usual, Q-A-M, hello

[02:19:30.360 --> 02:19:31.040]
Hey, Neil

[02:19:31.700 --> 02:19:32.740]
Un? Listenable, yes

[02:19:33.140 --> 02:19:37.960]
Um, I think Gal Ripkin will be inducted in the Hall of Fame next year

[02:19:37.960 --> 02:19:41.580]
Barry Bond's, he won't even go in on the first bow

[02:19:42.180 --> 02:19:44.140]
But is Sam usual on your list?

[02:19:44.400 --> 02:19:46.000]
No, he got all of God

[02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:49.820]
We can put him on it, well when we, oh God, Sam Usal wasn't known as much of a bass runner

[02:19:49.820 --> 02:19:51.940]
Who is as slow as molasses, he was a, you know

[02:19:51.940 --> 02:19:54.880]
Yeah, compare him to Mickey Mishmple

[02:19:54.880 --> 02:19:58.640]
Yeah, you compare him now, I wouldn't put him in the same league with Mickey Mantle

[02:19:58.640 --> 02:20:01.920]
Not even the same ballpark, we'll really measure Mickey Mantle, are you kidding me?

[02:20:01.960 --> 02:20:07.420]
We can start putting on like Andy Pathco and, uh, you know, uh, some of those guys

[02:20:07.420 --> 02:20:08.680]
How about Yogi Barra?

[02:20:09.080 --> 02:20:10.000]
Well, I don't know about him

[02:20:10.420 --> 02:20:12.920]
Really, I do, he's, uh, likes the F-Lac Duck

[02:20:13.300 --> 02:20:16.180]
And he said it ain't over until your call is done and believe me, it's done

[02:20:16.180 --> 02:20:19.060]
But that was that guy talking about, he said Elsen Howard

[02:20:19.900 --> 02:20:21.940]
You can even put Stan Musal on there if you want

[02:20:21.940 --> 02:20:24.680]
But then, see we can put all the great players on there

[02:20:24.680 --> 02:20:26.360]
And then we'll have a list of like 50,000 names

[02:20:26.360 --> 02:20:27.340]
And that's not the point

[02:20:27.340 --> 02:20:30.560]
See, the question is, who is the greatest baseball player of all time?

[02:20:30.700 --> 02:20:34.060]
I mean, if you would try to tell me Stan Musal is better like Babe Ruth or Ty Cobb

[02:20:34.060 --> 02:20:36.060]
I'd look you in the face and go, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

[02:20:36.060 --> 02:20:39.880]
I mean, there are other great players we haven't put on there because of the generational thing, you know

[02:20:39.880 --> 02:20:43.240]
I mean, Ty Cobb is from 800 years ago, but how about like Walters Johnson?

[02:20:43.740 --> 02:20:45.020]
How about Roger's Hornsby, huh?

[02:20:45.600 --> 02:20:47.460]
How about, uh, Gabby Hartnett?

[02:20:48.140 --> 02:20:49.000]
Gabby Hayes, right?

[02:20:49.760 --> 02:20:49.840]
Huh?

[02:20:50.220 --> 02:20:50.940]
Hank Greenberg?

[02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:53.020]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello

[02:20:53.900 --> 02:20:56.280]
Who wants to put Stan Musal under? What about Al-Kalai?

[02:20:56.460 --> 02:20:57.280]
Q-A-M, hello

[02:20:57.280 --> 02:20:58.520]
Yeah, how about Ron Santa?

[02:20:59.860 --> 02:21:01.480]
Anyway, hey, Neil, how's the mouthpiece?

[02:21:01.640 --> 02:21:02.080]
I'll tell you that

[02:21:02.600 --> 02:21:06.720]
Commander of Chimps was running around the nation talking about the success story of Cal Afer

[02:21:06.720 --> 02:21:09.720]
and now Rack, we're heading cleared out all the, uh, the surgeons

[02:21:09.720 --> 02:21:10.360]
Yeah

[02:21:10.360 --> 02:21:13.440]
Uh, bombing there today, suicide, killed 40

[02:21:13.440 --> 02:21:14.200]
Oh, right!

[02:21:14.440 --> 02:21:15.560]
Yeah, we've had that on before

[02:21:15.560 --> 02:21:17.200]
Yeah, that's the success story

[02:21:17.200 --> 02:21:20.860]
We're doing it, baby, don't forget mission accomplished, MI, mission accomplished

[02:21:20.860 --> 02:21:23.120]
If that's the success story, where's the failure, right?

[02:21:23.580 --> 02:21:24.860]
Uh, everywhere, okay, thanks

[02:21:24.860 --> 02:21:28.020]
Yeah, the, uh, it's working, it's working with Chimps

[02:21:28.020 --> 02:21:30.380]
Doug Thompson writes, your favorite, do I have time for this?

[02:21:30.380 --> 02:21:31.160]
Yeah, I'll make time

[02:21:31.160 --> 02:21:32.400]
They tell the right, it's your format

[02:21:33.460 --> 02:21:34.200]
Move by that

[02:21:34.200 --> 02:21:35.960]
No, I don't think I got time, this is for real

[02:21:35.960 --> 02:21:39.020]
Well, I, see, when I do that, it's a bad idea

[02:21:39.020 --> 02:21:42.440]
Because then Tom Jik is right, then reading these bedtime stories is bad

[02:21:42.440 --> 02:21:44.280]
Because I rush through them and I fumble and bumble

[02:21:44.280 --> 02:21:46.760]
And then nobody even gets the, the drift up, you know what I'm saying?

[02:21:46.960 --> 02:21:48.580]
Nobody even gets the, uh, the gist

[02:21:48.580 --> 02:21:49.380]
Can I say that?

[02:21:49.620 --> 02:21:51.340]
Oh, sorry, Joyce, nobody gets the f*** of it

[02:21:51.340 --> 02:21:52.140]
Can't say that

[02:21:52.140 --> 02:21:52.740]
Careful

[02:21:52.740 --> 02:21:56.300]
It's called with a G, Joyce, Joyce with a J, just with a G

[02:21:56.300 --> 02:21:58.120]
Just, uh, cut the crap, Joyce

[02:21:58.620 --> 02:22:01.680]
We got a thousand and fifty-three vote on there, did we put Stan Yucil?

[02:22:02.100 --> 02:22:03.500]
We did, yeah, we don't have any votes

[02:22:03.900 --> 02:22:05.280]
Yeah, that guy I vote for

[02:22:05.280 --> 02:22:07.220]
You heard what he said, oh, God, when I said, oh, he's on it

[02:22:07.220 --> 02:22:09.700]
Oh, God, like, like, I mean, how can you do that?

[02:22:09.780 --> 02:22:11.360]
Like Joe Cunningham will be on there next

[02:22:11.360 --> 02:22:13.660]
I mean, what about Red Shandies, huh?

[02:22:14.120 --> 02:22:15.180]
What about any Matthews?

[02:22:15.220 --> 02:22:16.620]
Boy, I sure liked any Matthews

[02:22:16.620 --> 02:22:18.480]
What about Dale Murphy, huh?

[02:22:18.940 --> 02:22:21.720]
What about Raphael, uh, what the hell was the short stuff for the Braves?

[02:22:22.420 --> 02:22:24.000]
Raphael, uh, he was terrible

[02:22:24.680 --> 02:22:26.960]
You know who was the announcer that really bugged me the most?

[02:22:27.180 --> 02:22:27.560]
Who's that?

[02:22:27.560 --> 02:22:29.800]
What's the thing about this? He has the Ernie Johnson with the Braves?

[02:22:30.300 --> 02:22:31.820]
Yeah, remember Ernie Johnson?

[02:22:32.100 --> 02:22:32.400]
I do

[02:22:32.400 --> 02:22:33.220]
The ex-pitcher?

[02:22:33.500 --> 02:22:37.040]
He was so annoying, uh, he was Raffi, he was Raffi, he was Murphy

[02:22:37.040 --> 02:22:40.780]
He just said the way he talked to me, he just didn't, he just didn't belong on here

[02:22:40.780 --> 02:22:43.400]
And then he would, he also retired about a hundred times

[02:22:43.400 --> 02:22:46.560]
Even Mary Olamu never retired as many times as Ernie Johnson

[02:22:46.560 --> 02:22:47.820]
God, almighty

[02:22:47.820 --> 02:22:50.420]
And then every time some of the Braves games were wide up on another one

[02:22:50.420 --> 02:22:54.700]
There was Atlanta cable stations that there would be Ernie Johnson and they'd drag Shleifah out of here

[02:22:54.700 --> 02:22:57.400]
They've had some of the worst announcers other than Skip Carey

[02:22:57.400 --> 02:23:01.040]
I was chip working with him on a game so I'm watching a baseball, I guess it's Skip and Chip

[02:23:01.780 --> 02:23:02.500]
Yeah, yeah

[02:23:02.500 --> 02:23:06.140]
They're good, but other than that, that Pete Van Wearing, man, he's just horrible

[02:23:06.140 --> 02:23:09.400]
They've had some of the most awful announcers there in Atlanta and Ernie Johnson

[02:23:09.400 --> 02:23:13.680]
What the hell was that short stuff? Raffi, uh, uh, uh, Ramires

[02:23:13.680 --> 02:23:18.400]
Oh, what, what a mind, what a brain, Raffi, uh, Ramires, am I right?

[02:23:18.640 --> 02:23:20.560]
Josh, uh, when, when are you talking about?

[02:23:20.760 --> 02:23:24.260]
Just a few years ago, oh, Google it for Christ's sake, what is wrong with you?

[02:23:24.260 --> 02:23:27.680]
You're, you're giving me an argument about Gary Bonz is the best player of all time

[02:23:27.680 --> 02:23:28.920]
You don't even know Raffi, old Ramires?

[02:23:29.300 --> 02:23:32.000]
Next thing you're gonna ask me who the hell Ryan Sandberg was

[02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:33.580]
Okay, ridiculous, huh?

[02:23:33.580 --> 02:23:36.220]
The hell's right, and what are, how come Ernie Banks is non-disclist?

[02:23:36.420 --> 02:23:38.020]
Let's get some Cubs you son here

[02:23:38.020 --> 02:23:41.800]
C Stan Newseals got one as Harry Carey would say Newseal, I don't know why he said that

[02:23:41.800 --> 02:23:42.880]
He always said that

[02:23:42.880 --> 02:23:44.740]
Ernie Banks, right? Let's play ten

[02:23:45.280 --> 02:23:45.680]
Okay

[02:23:46.240 --> 02:23:48.780]
Now, certainly you remember, certainly Ernie Banks?

[02:23:49.120 --> 02:23:49.720]
Of course, yeah

[02:23:50.260 --> 02:23:53.560]
How about Willie McCovie? You're a big giant scott, as very Bonz crap, Willie McCovie

[02:23:53.560 --> 02:23:54.740]
You wanna get him on there, he was good

[02:23:54.740 --> 02:23:57.100]
Okay, Willie Stargell, what do I want?

[02:23:57.300 --> 02:24:03.420]
Let's Willie Stargell, Dave Parker, Phil Mazurowski, Dip Grote, listen, maybe I should rock

[02:24:03.420 --> 02:24:06.520]
Hoppe, Austin, copy all the major league players that have already been there

[02:24:06.520 --> 02:24:08.960]
Now we're talking, there you go, let's do it the fair way

[02:24:08.960 --> 02:24:10.800]
Stop that, everybody achieve

[02:24:10.800 --> 02:24:11.480]
Everybody achieve, right?

[02:24:12.520 --> 02:24:15.600]
This is Camila Pascale, Pedro Ramos

[02:24:17.680 --> 02:24:22.440]
It's Hurricane Hotline, 1397 from Furny Coast, R. St. Austin, South Miami

[02:24:22.440 --> 02:24:27.480]
Top college hoops with head coach Frank Hay, here on 560 QAM

[02:24:27.480 --> 02:24:28.540]
You're bad

[02:24:30.280 --> 02:24:34.140]
Oh, Dave, you know I never made them personal

[02:24:34.140 --> 02:24:37.920]
Oh, I saw you stare at the way they do

[02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:40.080]
I wanna go get nowhere at you

[02:24:40.080 --> 02:24:41.900]
I think it was one of the first times

[02:24:41.900 --> 02:24:43.860]
Oh my God, I'm so unlucky

[02:24:43.860 --> 02:24:44.740]
Really?

[02:24:45.580 --> 02:24:46.680]
I'm a man of girls

[02:24:46.680 --> 02:24:48.040]
I have a wonder

[02:24:48.040 --> 02:24:49.440]
I have a wonder

[02:24:49.440 --> 02:24:51.260]
I can't remain tall

[02:24:51.260 --> 02:24:52.560]
She meant her

[02:24:53.260 --> 02:24:55.380]
I'm in a laced roof full of hair

[02:24:56.260 --> 02:24:58.520]
And all her teeth were flat

[02:24:59.260 --> 02:25:02.120]
She smelled like wine and turbid tines

[02:25:02.120 --> 02:25:04.500]
And had a big cold water bath

[02:25:04.500 --> 02:25:05.680]
I'm totally uncomfortable

[02:25:06.260 --> 02:25:07.740]
She's Willie Erick

[02:25:08.260 --> 02:25:10.640]
She's Willie Erick

[02:25:11.260 --> 02:25:14.440]
She's Willie Erick's size too

[02:25:16.120 --> 02:25:18.720]
And if you saw her, I'd say

[02:25:18.720 --> 02:25:21.860]
In a crowded place

[02:25:23.340 --> 02:25:28.140]
You would throw up in your mouth

[02:25:28.140 --> 02:25:30.180]
30, 30, 30

[02:25:30.180 --> 02:25:31.600]
Can you give me a chance?

[02:25:31.940 --> 02:25:33.420]
Can you come to home?

[02:25:34.080 --> 02:25:38.460]
She looked like a sick crackle

[02:25:39.440 --> 02:25:43.700]
Sort of like gently ringed nose

[02:25:43.700 --> 02:25:44.620]
That's a shot

[02:25:44.620 --> 02:25:50.420]
Once they see me QAM, Al-Cythe Conspirator is the carious or is it Zacharias or who cares Musawi?

[02:25:50.700 --> 02:25:51.540]
We decor the sack

[02:25:51.540 --> 02:25:52.400]
The Musi man

[02:25:52.400 --> 02:25:56.120]
Testify today that he and would be sure to Zach watch your back Zach

[02:25:56.120 --> 02:26:02.680]
Testify today that he and would be shoe bomber Richard Reed was both Isaac the fifth heir plan on September 11th and fly to the White House

[02:26:03.600 --> 02:26:05.120]
Musawi's testimony on his own behalf

[02:26:05.120 --> 02:26:08.120]
Stunned the courtroom as he disclosed details he had never revealed before

[02:26:08.120 --> 02:26:12.740]
It was in stark contrast to his previous statements in which he said the White House attack was to come later

[02:26:12.740 --> 02:26:18.000]
If the US refused to release a radical Egyptian chic or is that shake in prison on earlier terrorist convictions

[02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:19.020]
Shake Yaboodi

[02:26:19.020 --> 02:26:25.640]
Musawi testified he lied to investigate is when arrested in August of 2001 because he wanted to let the attacks on 9-11 go forward

[02:26:25.640 --> 02:26:29.300]
Yes, you can say that he said when the prosecution asked if that was why he misled them

[02:26:29.300 --> 02:26:32.060]
The statement was the key to the government's case that the attacks might have been averted

[02:26:32.060 --> 02:26:34.240]
Had Musawi been more cooperative following his arrest

[02:26:34.240 --> 02:26:40.080]
He told the court he knew the attacks were coming sometime after August 2001 and bought a radio so he could hear them unfold

[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:45.080]
Which he sure is helping to be listening to QAme if he was Miami or across the street which they were on the area

[02:26:45.800 --> 02:26:49.460]
Specifically you see that I'm thinking during this last break and I saw this story

[02:26:49.460 --> 02:26:56.300]
And I think about when we were at QAED and it was like any like a hurricane you know Andrew or like some major news event

[02:26:56.300 --> 02:27:01.160]
You know the OJ trail everybody in town would tune to us to hear it and we had the news department involved

[02:27:01.160 --> 02:27:04.480]
And we're like all over like stink on Greg you know remember?

[02:27:04.680 --> 02:27:05.860]
Yeah, I remember I'm trying to forget

[02:27:05.860 --> 02:27:10.800]
Oh and now just like on 9-11 when Gully said oh well what are we gonna say about it?

[02:27:10.860 --> 02:27:13.420]
Come on building strong. Well, we're gonna say come on we gotta talk about sport.

[02:27:13.860 --> 02:27:14.220]
sport

[02:27:15.360 --> 02:27:17.680]
God I can't we ever live that down. No

[02:27:18.100 --> 02:27:21.840]
Specifically he said he knew the world trade center was gonna be attacked but certainly he wasn't part of the plot

[02:27:21.840 --> 02:27:26.100]
And didn't know the details. Taken the stand in his own defense and his death penalty trial

[02:27:26.100 --> 02:27:31.660]
He said he declined to become a suicide pilot in some future attack when asked by senior Al-Qaeda official in 99

[02:27:31.660 --> 02:27:35.220]
I had knowledge that the twin towers would be hit he said I didn't know the details

[02:27:35.220 --> 02:27:39.540]
Asked by his Laura why he signed his Gully plea in April as the 20th hijacker he replied

[02:27:39.540 --> 02:27:43.300]
Because everybody used to refer to me as the 20th hijacker was a bit of fun

[02:27:44.040 --> 02:27:47.720]
Sorry, testified commonly his death penalty trial but against his Laura's wishes

[02:27:47.720 --> 02:27:52.260]
Before we took the stand his Laura's made a last attempt to stop him from testifying but failed

[02:27:52.260 --> 02:27:55.700]
The fence attorney Gerald Zirken who looks like her Gurken

[02:27:55.700 --> 02:28:01.140]
I argue that his client would not be a competent witness because he has contempt for the court only recognizes Islamic law

[02:28:01.140 --> 02:28:06.840]
And therefore the affirmation it takes it be meaningless as by Zirken if he was supposed to be one of the men who would pilot a plan on 9-11

[02:28:06.840 --> 02:28:09.780]
He said no adding I'm sorry. I don't know about the number of planes

[02:28:09.780 --> 02:28:15.700]
But I was not the fifth hijacker about his Gully plea he said I took a pen I signed it

[02:28:16.380 --> 02:28:25.400]
There you go that's a curious and mousseau is a Lucy man

[02:28:25.400 --> 02:28:28.680]
Press reports the UN says he's seeking asylum outside of Afghanistan

[02:28:29.400 --> 02:28:33.660]
That's not sitting well in the home front though even after the Taliban becoming Christian renouncing Islam

[02:28:33.660 --> 02:28:39.240]
Is a capital offense under Afghanistan's Islamic law often is caused triggered outrage in the outside world

[02:28:39.240 --> 02:28:40.160]
Death to the Christian

[02:28:40.980 --> 02:28:42.240]
5-6-7

[02:28:43.140 --> 02:28:45.000]
Yeah I'm going to try to argue with that

[02:28:45.620 --> 02:28:48.980]
Oh man 5-6-7-0-5-60

[02:28:50.800 --> 02:28:54.520]
On you crazy religion to go kill each other and leave the rest of us alone already

[02:28:54.520 --> 02:28:55.660]
We want nothing to do with it

[02:28:55.660 --> 02:28:57.120]
We're not part of your fight

[02:28:58.160 --> 02:29:02.280]
1075 votes the greatest baseball player of all time and isn't this appropriate?

[02:29:02.460 --> 02:29:04.880]
I've appropriate now the baseball season is going to be starting any moment now

[02:29:04.880 --> 02:29:06.960]
What's opening day Josh April looked to her

[02:29:06.960 --> 02:29:10.940]
Yeah I mean the marlins don't start the season on the road

[02:29:10.940 --> 02:29:12.340]
They come home

[02:29:12.340 --> 02:29:15.920]
Yeah but the good news I told you were you in there when I was telling you this morning about the schedule

[02:29:15.920 --> 02:29:18.300]
I never know when you're in there you're always very sneaky and required

[02:29:18.920 --> 02:29:19.500]
He did it out

[02:29:19.500 --> 02:29:20.380]
That's me I'm sneaky

[02:29:20.920 --> 02:29:24.500]
Anyway April 12th which that's a Wednesday not that far away either

[02:29:24.500 --> 02:29:29.680]
At 105 the podraisers in for two afternoon games 12 and 13th 105 both days

[02:29:29.680 --> 02:29:32.540]
Yeah which is their first home series

[02:29:32.540 --> 02:29:36.420]
Oh and the 19th the following Wednesday the reds game which I'm sure must be in Cincinnati

[02:29:36.420 --> 02:29:40.420]
12.35 pm that sounds like a noon exit for us on that day

[02:29:40.420 --> 02:29:40.980]
This is good

[02:29:42.460 --> 02:29:44.860]
See I spent my time since they have about to give me the

[02:29:44.860 --> 02:29:50.820]
Oh the schedule yet I spent a little bit of time about five minutes yesterday researching the April so there's three days in April

[02:29:50.820 --> 02:29:53.080]
That we get like an early exit to which we say

[02:29:53.080 --> 02:29:55.960]
Not that we don't want to do our part and do our duty but you know

[02:29:55.960 --> 02:29:58.000]
We don't have the chance to get out early you know that's right

[02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.140]
Like for example Hank's going off to Vegas

[02:30:00.140 --> 02:30:03.500]
They don't see him on a schedule on Thursday or Friday or I'm saying

[02:30:03.500 --> 02:30:05.980]
And then two to four on Thursday and Friday I'm seeing

[02:30:06.720 --> 02:30:11.040]
And I want to kill myself I just want to appeal myself on a sharp object till I keep in mind what you said

[02:30:11.040 --> 02:30:12.220]
And then just forget about it

[02:30:12.220 --> 02:30:12.440]
Yeah

[02:30:12.980 --> 02:30:15.240]
And see it's the only means of surviving

[02:30:15.240 --> 02:30:17.520]
But that's right that's right even he knows

[02:30:17.520 --> 02:30:18.580]
Don't get it on you

[02:30:18.580 --> 02:30:19.280]
Oh

[02:30:19.280 --> 02:30:23.280]
Doug Thompson Campbell Hill blue says just a little old-fashioned karma coming around

[02:30:23.280 --> 02:30:26.860]
He says the right wingers call it a witch hunt the left wing calls it justice

[02:30:26.860 --> 02:30:31.180]
Whatever you call it blogger bend Dominic and Washington Post dot com both got what they deserved

[02:30:31.180 --> 02:30:34.380]
You have to wonder what the suits at Washington Post dot com were smoking

[02:30:34.380 --> 02:30:39.740]
When they decided to create a right wing blog called red America and then hire a 24 year old want to be book editor

[02:30:39.740 --> 02:30:44.520]
Who brags about not being a journalist to write it that was a shallow move by so-called journalistic entity

[02:30:44.520 --> 02:30:51.760]
Dominic short lived 10 year at the post website came to an embarrassing and Friday when he resigned after the blogging community uncovered multiple cases of plagiarism

[02:30:51.760 --> 02:30:54.580]
By the answer who works as an editor at the other right wing

[02:30:55.220 --> 02:30:58.540]
Regnery press resigned as Washington speak for fired it

[02:30:58.540 --> 02:31:02.400]
I want to apologize to national review online my friends and colleagues here at Red State

[02:31:02.400 --> 02:31:09.400]
And to any others that have been affected over the past few days Dominic wrote Friday under his pen name Augustine on the red state website the right wing web

[02:31:09.400 --> 02:31:14.900]
Trivia to start I also want to apologize to my previous editors and writers whose work I used inappropriately without

[02:31:14.900 --> 02:31:19.620]
Attribution there's no excuse for this there was there any excuse for any obfuscation my earlier statement

[02:31:20.700 --> 02:31:24.380]
Obfuscation Dominic speak for I got caught and tried to weasel my way out of it didn't work

[02:31:24.380 --> 02:31:28.680]
Now he tries to contrition a little bit too late the apologies that red states hate Dominic will take some

[02:31:28.680 --> 02:31:34.640]
Need time off from the website that's their double speak for banishment our critics can raise their glasses and toast to what they think is success

[02:31:34.640 --> 02:31:37.780]
Turing down a flawed conservative the red state masters posted Friday

[02:31:37.780 --> 02:31:43.660]
But they realize their greatest weakness destroying a conservative is not to destroy conservatism and while they put all their energy

[02:31:43.660 --> 02:31:46.720]
Inventing this campaign it's worth remembering that for all the noise

[02:31:46.720 --> 02:31:51.580]
They have yet to present a real alternative to an America that rests on the foundation of freedom free markets and family

[02:31:51.580 --> 02:31:54.760]
Against that the only answer they have is yet another personal attack

[02:31:54.760 --> 02:32:03.720]
All the hypocrisy of politics it's a personal attack when the other side does it red state like most partisan blogs on both sides of the political offense exists primarily to attack the other side

[02:32:03.720 --> 02:32:08.080]
Most of them conservative or liberal are too busy bashing each other to offer any real alternatives

[02:32:08.080 --> 02:32:13.600]
Red state is where Dominic called Coretta Scott King the late wife of civil rights legend dr. Martin Luther King a communist

[02:32:13.600 --> 02:32:19.080]
He later called to claim a joke that I've learned after too many years of dealing with the right wing that most of them lack a sense of humor

[02:32:19.800 --> 02:32:29.540]
Dominic also claimed to use material originally written by author p.j. O work with a works knowledge and permission that came as quite a shock to work who told me or times he's never heard of Dominic and didn't remember ever meaning him

[02:32:29.540 --> 02:32:35.820]
I wouldn't want to swear in the court of law that an ever-methe guy worked hold at times but I sure didn't give him permission to use my words under his byline no

[02:32:35.820 --> 02:32:41.120]
In Arlington the suits of Washington Post dot com scrambled to come up with a plausible something explanation for this group

[02:32:41.120 --> 02:32:43.760]
While some of their own applauded the demise of Bend Dominic

[02:32:43.760 --> 02:32:50.740]
Excuse me if I shed no tears over the elimination in the first round and he practically the opening tip off of the new social conservative blog red America

[02:32:50.740 --> 02:32:58.060]
Written by this cat who claims his name has been Dominic writes post blogger Joel Ockenbach I guess to be a blogger with a poster name has to end in CH

[02:32:58.060 --> 02:33:04.460]
Apparently he saves time when writing by using words right off the shelf by produced customized writing when there's so many perfectly good words already crafted

[02:33:04.460 --> 02:33:11.020]
Dominic is supposedly 24 but I'm betting right here and now that he's a junior in high school Ockenbach continues all this other investigation

[02:33:11.020 --> 02:33:18.020]
His blog red America didn't contain anything would make someone thinking was the second coming of William F. Buckley indeed this whole affair seems like a spoof of prank

[02:33:18.020 --> 02:33:23.820]
To make all the real authentic rock rock rib hard-headed if perhaps slightly lizard hard to conserve his look bad

[02:33:23.820 --> 02:33:26.840]
Of course they say that about the entire last five years of the American government

[02:33:26.840 --> 02:33:33.960]
During an online chat session Friday post humor calmness Gene Weingarten observed journalism is journalism when you need people who have an idea what they're doing

[02:33:33.960 --> 02:33:39.060]
Even if they're just full-maning on the web amen but the message is lost with the bosses at Washington Post dot com

[02:33:39.060 --> 02:33:46.940]
In the past 24 hours we learned of allegations that vent Dominic plagiarized material that appeared under his by-line and various publications prior to Washington Post dot com

[02:33:46.940 --> 02:33:53.140]
Contracting with him to write a blog that launched Tuesday Washington Post dot com executive editor Jim Brady brought on the American blog Friday

[02:33:53.140 --> 02:33:57.480]
And investigation of those allegations was ongoing and the interim Dominic has resigned effective immediately

[02:33:57.480 --> 02:34:02.600]
Brady continued when we hired Dominic we weren't aware of any allegations that he had plagiarized any of his past writings

[02:34:02.600 --> 02:34:07.060]
In any cases where allegations such as these are made will continue to investigate those charges thoroughly

[02:34:07.060 --> 02:34:14.540]
In order to maintain our journalistic integrity sorry, but the post journalistic integrity went out the window when they won decided the website needed a right-wing

[02:34:14.540 --> 02:34:21.220]
Blog and too hard an amateur to write it there was a stupid move and the post is there's all the shame that comes from such incredible

[02:34:22.380 --> 02:34:27.480]
Incredibly stupidity and people like them can't afford to be made to look stupid or ridiculous

[02:34:29.300 --> 02:34:36.260]
That's what Marlon Brando said all the time I heard yeah now who is it that said that cap or something that was Jack Waltsitt in the gun font

[02:39:48.140 --> 02:39:53.440]
policy council see I don't understand but I guess it's the same as Christmas though because Christmas

[02:39:53.440 --> 02:39:59.380]
supposedly was going to be like a real religious holiday and then they they jazzed it up with all

[02:39:59.380 --> 02:40:04.300]
