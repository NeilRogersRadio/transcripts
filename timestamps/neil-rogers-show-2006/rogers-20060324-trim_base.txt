[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.240]
The Rogers presents

[00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.340]
commemorating 30 years of entertaining sound Florida.

[00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:06.900]
Oh right!

[00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.420]
Keep listening to the Neil Rogers Show to find out where you could pick up a CD or shirt to benefit a band and pet rescue and for Lauderdale.

[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:13.760]
Okay.

[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.840]
Brought to you by the Neil Rogers Show and 560.

[00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.060]
All right guys, been a great day.

[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.420]
Shall I leave you next to your help?

[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.900]
John Colton in the side of the glass.

[00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.860]
Always keeping the right.

[00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.420]
And the Rogers coming your way then it's gold.

[00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.520]
He had two Curtis for the mad dog.

[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.860]
Panther preview and then it's Panthers and the Rangers.

[00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.900]
That's going to do it.

[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.560]
Have a great day.

[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.140]
Stay safe.

[00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.800]
We'll see you next time.

[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.720]
For all the adventures TピK she was doing so.

[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.600]
Have a great day.

[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.500]
So you've been still salespeople are eye-sales.

[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.080]
That's absolutely...

[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.420]
Yes!

[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.440]
Where the hell

[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.260]
Look at you that won't stay on

[00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.060]
There is blood

[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.600]
Shake my butt and turn eyes off

[00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.610]
Rack them!

[00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.050]
I'm not a bad girl

[00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.910]
I can make a girl

[00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.970]
I'm not in the least

[00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.990]
That's where their blood flows

[00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.910]
Cause the sun should heal

[00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.890]
It's one of the things I were born

[00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.570]
But be it such a bad girl

[00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.510]
Be it such a bad girl

[00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.450]
I think this poll today is very revealing

[00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.130]
If you put that expression in the video

[00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.470]
No, seriously

[00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.470]
We've always talked about how Brittany has fallen

[00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:52.590]
The mighty of fallen

[00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.850]
How she's kind of like tainted goods

[00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.610]
And she's doing that good this time

[00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.810]
Does she take no?

[00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.830]
I mean she kicked ass

[00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.850]
I don't know when this original poll was

[00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.010]
Years ago, few years

[00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.570]
Four or five, whatever

[00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.490]
And there are some people we got on there now

[00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.830]
Who weren't even on the first poll

[00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.230]
Like Jessica Simpson for example

[00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.170]
I voted for her just because she was married to Nick

[00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.930]
She's doing well

[00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.030]
And she's doing very well

[00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.070]
And you know how Shakira

[00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.230]
Speaking of that bit

[00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.490]
It's got 20 votes already

[00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.110]
The first poll all at the end

[00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.990]
We had 1100 votes

[00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.870]
Yeah, she's come far

[00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.330]
She only had 11 votes all told

[00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.010]
All told

[00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.510]
So anyway, it's kind of interesting to see how

[00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.370]
People's altitudes have changed

[00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.150]
Anyways, 10.0.2.5.60

[00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.830]
So what's the word?

[00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.130]
Is it Curtis Myskejl says

[00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.610]
Mad Doggett Hoodies deraille the way

[00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.190]
So the way

[00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.070]
It's Goldie from 2 to 4

[00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.610]
And they're...

[00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:37.870]
We know that at the end of the center

[00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.150]
Yeah, they're both actually at the end of the center

[00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.650]
But who is it at 4?

[00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.370]
Curtis

[00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.150]
Oh, at the end of the center

[00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.090]
Oh, brother

[00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.490]
What kind of a schedule is this?

[00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.710]
Why?

[00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.670]
It's really something when you got three people running the programming department

[00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.690]
And we can't even get a schedule to me that makes sense

[00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.390]
It's almost like our sales department

[00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.350]
Anyway, our new sales manager was in today Chris

[00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.030]
So what's his name?

[00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.470]
Charles

[00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.490]
He was Jones in for some info

[00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.630]
And a bit of beep, but a boop

[00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.750]
And I guess he's discovered that what we already know

[00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.810]
And that is that more sales people are for vericators

[00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:05.330]
They lie

[00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.090]
They lie like crazy

[00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.230]
They tell tall tales

[00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.130]
In other words, they're BS artists, Bolshemit

[00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.070]
That's their speciality, Bolshemit

[00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.890]
And why send it to the QM sales department?

[00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.350]
They are the best at that

[00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.090]
So, Gelly at the end of the center

[00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.610]
Because this is again the game of the year

[00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.930]
I keep saying that because everyone is now for the Panthers

[00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.170]
Any interest in the Panthers?

[00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.410]
No

[00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.550]
We're going to play the Rangers at the end of the center tonight

[00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.970]
So, Gelly will be there from 2 to 4

[00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.330]
Squeaking his way to the top

[00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.430]
Squeaking his way toward the net with a breakaway

[00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.430]
Curtis at the end of the center from 4 to 7

[00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.770]
And we've got like a 5-hour buildup for the Panthers Ranger game

[00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.590]
And I guarantee there'd be 5,000 Ranger fans there tonight

[00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.470]
Each one more obnoxious than the other

[00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.850]
Panthers with 7 Panthers and the Rangers at 730

[00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.990]
With Henrik Lumpquist and Yami Yager

[00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.830]
And Tom Jicke fills in for Eddie Camp after the hockey game

[00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:48.970]
That should be a real tweet

[00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.450]
And you want to know why I say it's going to be a real tweet

[00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:52.610]
Why do you say it's going to be a real tweet?

[00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:53.530]
Because Tom Jicke

[00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.730]
He's 5,000!

[00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.730]
Other than that

[00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.370]
Yeah, call him up and express my personal thanks for the fine job

[00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.570]
He did reporting on my 30th anniversary on the year in the market

[00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.730]
I realize it's not significant

[00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.330]
And he did a stellar job on my 20th anniversary

[00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.850]
And again on the 25th

[00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.110]
And he hates me like poison now

[00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.810]
Because I have the audacity to expose the fact that he's an idiot

[00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.550]
And doesn't write about anything local

[00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.430]
I'm a guy that's supposed to be out of touch because of my ass is sitting in Toronto

[00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.030]
But in the meantime, there's a guy who's ass is sitting right there

[00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.830]
And he doesn't write about anything local TV radio

[00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.250]
Very, very seldom

[00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.410]
Never about local radio

[00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.990]
I mean, maybe once a year

[00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.550]
Here's the poll speaking of local radio from yesterday

[00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:29.850]
Other than WQAM

[00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.810]
What radio station do you listen to most?

[00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:32.910]
Radio Stasiolan

[00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:33.110]
Okay?

[00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.170]
I don't listen to other stations

[00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.790]
284, how many votes have we had before I chopped this baby off?

[00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:38.510]
1611

[00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.750]
Wasn't that the frequency of the former fan 1611 I think so

[00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.550]
284, 17 and a half percent dullest in other stations and we love them dearly

[00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.110]
We want to give me to kiss

[00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.530]
Well, from a distance

[00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:50.570]
There you go

[00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.930]
Serious 232, I must be the sperm factor, isn't it?

[00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.570]
How it's sperm?

[00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:55.450]
Must be

[00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.270]
W-I-N-Z that's scared America is in...

[00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.510]
What?

[00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.870]
170

[00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.770]
Waxi-790, that ticket, 143

[00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.770]
8.8 percent for the ticket

[00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.010]
Well, that must be the Sid Rosenstein Berg audience

[00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.990]
He's still there?

[00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:10.470]
God, it must be a record

[00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.690]
I bet your feral is jealous of that record

[00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:13.970]
It's been there longer this for us days

[00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.790]
Anyway, WLRN 141

[00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.210]
Wow, and that was like a little bit of a late addition

[00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.990]
If we can use that expression as a copyrighted late addition

[00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.850]
Cool, let's check

[00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:22.730]
With Wolflet's Cree

[00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.470]
Is that like the situation room?

[00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.870]
XM 125, Joe Kostello got little blurb and Jim Sartey this morning to sunset

[00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.730]
Your close personal buddy, Joe Kostello

[00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.670]
Who's going to be doing some NASCAR crap from Homestead this weekend

[00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:34.910]
At a boy, Joe, you go

[00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.230]
Don't call me please

[00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.510]
W-I-N-Z 100

[00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.050]
That's the right wing fairy tales

[00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.350]
I don't know what that's all about

[00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.970]
You wouldn't think that 6.2 percent of our audience

[00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.630]
Listened most to that proper gang, proper gang, do you?

[00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.690]
Did that right wing swill?

[00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:49.350]
What would they do?

[00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.190]
Those are the talk show groupies, I guess

[00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:52.750]
WBGG Big

[00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.710]
That's Rod and Young Paul 80

[00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.750]
I can't imagine anybody listen to the music they play

[00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.870]
The music of the 70s and 80s

[00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.070]
Yesterday and tomorrow and crap

[00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.350]
Magic speaking of crap 70 votes

[00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.210]
With all due apologies to my good friend Rick Shaw

[00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.350]
And your good friend Ron St. John

[00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:08.250]
Yes

[00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.370]
What do I ever happen to Joe Johnson?

[00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:11.290]
Remember Joe's Johnson?

[00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:11.650]
No

[00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.470]
Yeah, he was dating Linda Thornton

[00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:14.970]
And then she had the audacity to die?

[00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:15.610]
No

[00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:17.150]
Well what a sweetheart she was

[00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:18.650]
Yeah, Joe Johnson come on

[00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.430]
He was on magic for a long time

[00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.590]
He was on gloves 94, I think he's been around

[00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:23.530]
I'll take your word for it

[00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:23.910]
Cone

[00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:25.790]
WKIS KISS 51

[00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:26.930]
It's just ain't what he used to be

[00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.090]
Now the Johnny Dark is there

[00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.490]
Well I know what a shame we can't play that jingle no more

[00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:33.010]
Let's see how much of it we can play

[00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:34.870]
Johnny Dark said it

[00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:36.450]
There, I was pretty good

[00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:37.670]
Right, that'll do

[00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.550]
Didn't even get either a salabel on there

[00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.190]
Kind of little piece of each

[00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:42.310]
Coast 28

[00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:43.830]
Gloves 94, 26

[00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.290]
All the soons all the time

[00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:46.510]
Power 96, 19

[00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:47.990]
19 punks wasn't that crap

[00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:49.030]
Slime and jamma crap

[00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.210]
WKPX Piper High 17

[00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:52.630]
Which you say you can't hear it no more

[00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:53.530]
Because your signal's in the middle

[00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:56.430]
WVM 15 for the Mike Rosenthal show

[00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.190]
You made a mistake, oh boy

[00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:00.730]
W news time is 202

[00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.050]
Oh god, you're right I should write a book

[00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.130]
Even if I'm the only one that reads it

[00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:05.890]
Well you'd read it

[00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:07.510]
Yeah, I have somebody read it to me

[00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:09.470]
Right, no that would be a toy

[00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:10.370]
Would it do that?

[00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:15.490]
WRM 15, WEDR 14, WM GE SMAGMA radio 14

[00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:16.670]
Now what's that one?

[00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:17.410]
No spanish

[00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:18.850]
Oh, that one's over here, yes Spanish

[00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:21.430]
That was the one that used to be she

[00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:23.490]
What's the frequency?

[00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:24.170]
I'm very important

[00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:24.990]
It is

[00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:26.170]
Is that the one, I love it

[00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:27.130]
No, that's the one that would be a mine

[00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:28.670]
It used to be Zeta, no Zeta

[00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:30.990]
It used to be Zeta, oh, all these used to be

[00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:32.650]
You know just like us we used to be popular

[00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:35.050]
WHDR 13, Y100

[00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:35.490]
What?

[00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:36.090]

[00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:38.110]
Remember the days when there was so many

[00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:39.870]
Really talented people on the earth's market

[00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:40.490]
Remember those days?

[00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:41.430]
Yeah, I do what I was a kid

[00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:43.050]
What, yeah long time ago

[00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:44.470]
Then they all vanished

[00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:46.330]
WJNA 9

[00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:47.210]
Oh get out of here

[00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:48.190]
We actually put that on there

[00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:50.210]
For wine, Mike, and his jingles

[00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:52.210]
WFTL, it's 857

[00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.430]
They actually believed that Steve Laffa

[00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:55.890]
And his group of lapdogs

[00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.990]
And Bob Eisenberg, he by the way, Bob

[00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:59.030]
You're a whole too

[00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.270]
Or I'm sorry, an F-ing hole

[00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:03.490]
WQVA, La Cubanissima 5

[00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:05.850]
Waves 4, WAVS, Haitian

[00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:07.570]
That's for the Haitian hater out there

[00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:08.530]
That guy, Maniac

[00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:09.790]
I've got a bunch of Haitians

[00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:11.690]
Traces calls and go to us to speed this

[00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:12.390]
Not on them

[00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.450]
We'll trace out and call and give his address out of the air

[00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:15.070]
Yeah, that's right

[00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:16.350]
Give us your phone number and your address

[00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:17.770]
This time you go and give it out in the road

[00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:18.730]
Haitian, what do they speak?

[00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:19.370]
Pattoi

[00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:20.450]
Pattoi

[00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:23.590]
I'm just looking at this cruise ship passenger here

[00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:24.130]
Whoever he is

[00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:25.030]
Oh yeah, another one

[00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:26.150]
You got that story of sure

[00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.910]
And I really didn't

[00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:29.630]
That, the fire, the guy died

[00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:30.530]
Oh yeah, that's old news

[00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:31.090]
Oh dude

[00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:31.590]
And tell your people

[00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:33.950]
Oh and the comment on CNN is old

[00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:35.310]
But of course when you crunch the numbers

[00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.250]
There's these millions of people going cruise ships every

[00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:38.910]
Some have actually come home alive

[00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:40.530]
And not rape, did they, or a sick?

[00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:41.930]
Oh wow

[00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:43.970]
What a tremendous endorsement that is

[00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:47.450]
WFTL7, WQVA 5, Waves 4, WSDJ3

[00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:49.410]
Norspeciting place, IE

[00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:53.770]
WHQT3, WAMR, radio on Moore 3

[00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:56.450]
WRGP, that's FIU radio which we never heard of

[00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:58.670]
And thanks to the guy that called it in, the punk 2

[00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:01.330]
WNBM2, I think that's more Haitian melodies

[00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:06.390]
WAQI, radio Mambi is got a pair

[00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:08.490]
That's that 710 frequency

[00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:10.250]
Man boy, I used to be WGBS

[00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:11.570]
Oh man

[00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:14.070]
And I think that 790 used to be WNWS

[00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:15.350]
Snood, all snooze radio

[00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.390]
Hey Dennis Collins, you're a genius man

[00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:21.170]
WMIB1, WSUA, we find you got a Colombian

[00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.910]
Ah, one, it's got to be a Colombian because it's

[00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:25.570]
What is it called? El Cata Cón

[00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:28.930]
Okay, Colombian, all Colombian drug melodies all the time

[00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:32.570]
WROT, audio ritmo, WRMA, radio romancia

[00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:35.310]
And WCMQ, CEMQ, none

[00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:38.770]
That's pretty amazing because CMQ's got a lot of big audience but not our crowds

[00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:41.510]
In fact, there's not the state that's supposed to have that very popular

[00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:44.110]
No speaking lace morning show, those two very funny guys

[00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:45.330]
I'll go ask some black

[00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:48.450]
And go ask what are your, uh, Julio friends

[00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:49.630]
Ask your mama

[00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:51.470]
Now what does she listen to?

[00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:52.230]
My mama

[00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:52.890]
What's that with her?

[00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:54.630]
She didn't listen to the radio

[00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:55.830]
How do you know that?

[00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:57.090]
Probably the only one

[00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:01.630]
It's one of the TV watching Spanish language soap operas all day like all the other old ladies

[00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:02.790]
Well good for her

[00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:04.350]
Nice going honey, you go

[00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:05.870]
The pitch quits it out of the way

[00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:08.130]
Former you have it probably not the same ones

[00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:09.290]
Or not for the same reason

[00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:09.630]
No

[00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:12.250]
Former Major League of War and Call Me Homey Chromardi

[00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:14.510]
Oh god, this is in the very jackass

[00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:17.890]
I know, either Barry or Sarni would have something of minor interest today

[00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:18.290]
Call me

[00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:19.450]
By the way, 567

[00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:21.710]
Oh, 860

[00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:23.950]
So you see some arm-truck problems?

[00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:24.330]
Right

[00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.450]
Another one of our really top-notch broadcasters

[00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:30.230]
He spent last season managing a Japanese team and independent baseball league in California

[00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:34.370]
He's returning to WQA, as we bring more uh, swill back to the scene of the crime

[00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:36.790]
I hope Joel Bell went out and got a lot of cash and we're okay

[00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:40.030]
Crow will be a host on talk shows before weekend Marlins games

[00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:42.550]
He's also assisting in making a movie about his experience

[00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:43.690]
How do you like that?

[00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:46.650]
Meanwhile Marlins general manager, manager Joe Gerardi

[00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:49.510]
And starting pitcher Don Trell will is learning to spell with Don Trell

[00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:52.090]
Have struck deals to do weekly shows on 790 to ticket

[00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:52.770]
All right

[00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:54.250]
Better than us

[00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:55.770]
Those segments, man

[00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:56.470]
All those segments

[00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:59.570]
Like the Eric Reed segment and the uh, what's his name?

[00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:00.550]
Arrow Windbag segment

[00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:03.090]
Oh god, talk about Tumau, talk about Killer

[00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:05.150]
It's like Steve Kane in the baseball card shows

[00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:06.930]
Narrow, Narrow, Narrow, casting

[00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:09.730]
Let me have a little teeny tiny slice of that pie, please

[00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:10.270]
You know that?

[00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:10.750]
That teeny tiny pie

[00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:11.230]
That's great radio

[00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:11.810]
Right

[00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:14.630]
But you can't convince these, you can't tell them nothing, man

[00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:16.070]
And I'm, you're right, I've given up trying

[00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:17.010]
Mark it tell you, please

[00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:18.350]
Oh please, right on judge

[00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:18.950]
I'll tell you

[00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:22.770]
Friday, March 21st, 4th, I can't even say it, I'm tongue tied

[00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:24.450]
The day the Neil finally rises up

[00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:27.110]
Just like when I stormed out of it, I went into woodbying yesterday

[00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:30.770]
I played a machine 200 bucks, I didn't get a spin, I didn't get a cherry nothing

[00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:32.710]
So I walked another machine and flew down

[00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:35.730]
And the guy comes along, puts in three coins in the machine I just left

[00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:37.710]
And that machine got three grand on the line

[00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:38.830]
Oh, did you puke?

[00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:39.810]
I wanted to

[00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:42.810]
And as I ran out last night after many hours of frustration I yelled

[00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:43.810]
You just cost me $6,000

[00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:47.190]
You're laughing, I'm crying

[00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:48.550]
It was not a good experience

[00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:50.930]
It's one of those things, you know, that's what they call a gambling

[00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:51.490]
Right

[00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:53.750]
That's why they say a fool in his money are soon farted

[00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:54.450]
And I did

[00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:58.070]
10, 13, 5, 60, WQAM being outdoors a lot in South Florida

[00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:00.630]
Really needs some comfortable shoes to take good care of them tootsies

[00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:04.030]
So the only place to go is Brandy shoes and pompano beats

[00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:06.950]
Be sure to tell me that Brian's smuts are sensual when they last their ass off

[00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:13.190]
Brandy's series major brands like Floreshime, Echo, Mephisto, Rockport, Hushpuffies, New Balance, all the other big name brands

[00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:14.890]
And all sizes for men and women

[00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:17.570]
And they've been created wide widths in those hard to find sizes too

[00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:18.570]
Like 106

[00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:21.470]
Brandy shoes is the largest independent shoe retailer in South Florida

[00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:23.850]
When you see those selection value, you get it Brandy's you'll understand

[00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:26.450]
I've been telling you how great they are for many many years now

[00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:29.250]
I'm sure that Brian will keep them on here unlike some of our other people

[00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:30.830]
Who can't keep anybody on here

[00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:33.910]
Go see our good friend Arnie, he'll get to the right fitting shoes for your feet

[00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:37.030]
Brandy's isn't like a department store where you have to wait forever to get service

[00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:39.090]
And then the salesholds has it, oh guess what?

[00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:40.750]
You like that style we don't have it in your size

[00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.230]
The only thing that they sell at Brandy's is shoes

[00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:46.310]
So you don't have to worry about size selection or service they know their crap

And they know the smell of your feet

[00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:50.710]

This is 5.16 Q-B

[00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.210]
Friday you're best dude

[00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:30.710]
Hey everybody!

[00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:33.770]
The toy toy hand is back on its head

[00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:35.590]
The toy hand is back on its head

[00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:37.790]
The toy hand is back on its head

[00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:42.170]

Oh, you think they're big guys?

[00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:10.070]
Hey everybody!

[00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:13.290]
What's the secret toy toy you don't know?

[00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:19.870]
Don't know, they're a truck that's back and shabble up from the top

[00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.670]
And they get toy

[00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:24.890]

[00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:44.870]
Yeah, join

[00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:45.950]
And say something about toys

[00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:52.110]
I said they're big guys and I was gonna tell you what that is

[00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:55.610]
I'm doing what I was right now.

[00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:57.150]
What are you doing?

[00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:59.170]
I'm going to say I'm shopping for jelly shoes.

[00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:01.310]
What are you doing?

[00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:03.110]
I'm over here.

[00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:04.010]
I am.

[00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:05.750]
I'm over here.

[00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:06.970]
I'm over here.

[00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:07.250]

[00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:08.050]
I'm over here.

[00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:08.830]
I'm over here.

[00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.790]
I'm over here.

[00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:10.990]
I'm over here.

[00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:12.510]
Hey, he's yelling like a fella.

[00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:14.390]
And I need a little bit of that to honeydew melons,

[00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:14.910]
but I'm here.

[00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:16.910]
And 10, 19, and 5, 60, WQM.

[00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:17.670]
Here's today's pool.

[00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:19.270]
It's one we did years ago.

[00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:20.990]
And now it's really something to see the way

[00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:22.290]
the deck has been shuffled, you know?

[00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:24.890]
By the way, Harrison has uploaded that the first time in

[00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:27.070]
2001, July 9th.

[00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:27.270]
Wow.

[00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:28.790]
Five years ago.

[00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:29.050]
Yeah.

[00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:30.030]
Holy moly.

[00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:30.750]
See, this is the thing.

[00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:33.470]
No, tell us we repeat the same pool over and over again.

[00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:34.690]
Or George does like that one.

[00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:35.150]
What?

[00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:36.090]
Blank, blank, blank.

[00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:37.130]
That's the third one.

[00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:37.890]
I like that too.

[00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:38.670]
Every time that's.

[00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:39.730]
I'm going to start doing that every day.

[00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:40.030]
What?

[00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:41.330]
I mean, they've answered your own calling.

[00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:41.810]
But anyway.

[00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:42.950]
Yeah, that's true.

[00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:44.830]
George says we had faxes this morning.

[00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:46.290]
People who don't understand this pool.

[00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:48.250]
If you don't, you must not speak it in ways.

[00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:51.230]
I mean, this is this straightforward and literally straightforward.

[00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:53.170]
We probably ought to add on here a couple of things.

[00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:54.530]
I hate this pool is none there.

[00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:54.890]
Right.

[00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:57.230]
And also none of these, I'm gay.

[00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:58.430]
We had that on there one time.

[00:16:58.650 --> 00:16:58.690]
Yeah.

[00:16:58.690 --> 00:16:59.730]
I have to forget you.

[00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:00.930]
No, don't forget it.

[00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:02.150]
That's how I keep forgetting.

[00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:02.630]
Oh.

[00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:03.230]
What?

[00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:05.130]
They're gay people out there, you know?

[00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:05.410]
No.

[00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:05.930]
Me too.

[00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:06.850]
No, I can't.

[00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:07.330]
I'll get it.

[00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:07.630]
I'm here.

[00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:10.190]
Which of these women would you most like to see naked?

[00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:11.450]
Do you haven't seen naked already?

[00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:13.330]
Jessica Alba, 46.

[00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:16.050]
Now, the first time we did this five years ago, Jessica Alba,

[00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:18.850]
I think the audience would be interested in these things.

[00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:20.190]
Was asked to do with naked chicks.

[00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:25.390]
Jessica Alba had 36 total and she's already got 46.

[00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:26.050]
Right.

[00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:27.310]
And that was out of 1100 votes.

[00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:29.150]
She's made a level of high profile movie.

[00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:30.530]
Well, I'll be damned.

[00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:33.170]
And she makes that great chocolate drink, that Alba.

[00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:35.650]
Jessica's doing very well.

[00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:36.770]
Jessica's doing very well.

[00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:38.130]
Better than the one that was on that plane.

[00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:39.250]
The child pilot.

[00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:39.950]
Oh, yeah.

[00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:42.150]
Jessica Simpson wasn't even on the first one.

[00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.490]
Five years ago, whoever heard of that pitch, 42.

[00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:47.330]
So you made her popular once she was on this show and you went...

[00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:47.330]

[00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:48.110]
That's what it was.

[00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.610]
Mm.

[00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:49.610]
Got her to resident.

[00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:52.770]
Maybe it was Nick that made her popular by pointing out what a bubble hit she was.

[00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:54.810]
He made her something, but not pregnant.

[00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:57.450]
Well, when we were to make her pregnant, they would have had to do something.

[00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:00.510]
Barbara and Janet Bush, the president's daughter, is 38.

[00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:02.770]
Now, the interesting thing is they were third the first time.

[00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:04.470]
They had 85 votes the first time.

[00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:05.390]
And that amazing.

[00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:06.330]
They had to have sex.

[00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:07.450]
I'm sure that's because they're sad.

[00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:07.810]
They're a set.

[00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:11.990]
Yeah, no, I think it's the embarrassment factor that causes most people want to see them naked.

[00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:13.470]
I mean, plus maybe they got something there.

[00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:16.950]
But I think just for humiliation, a nice centerfold and playboy would be nice.

[00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:20.390]
Or maybe a nice centerfold and playgirl, a fat ass governor, Jeb Bush.

[00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:22.790]
Jennifer loved Hewitt, 34.

[00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:24.310]
Let's see how did she do it.

[00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:24.750]
She had...

[00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:26.030]
She did okay the first time.

[00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:26.750]
She was top 10.

[00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:29.450]
Shakira is moving on up to the east side, baby.

[00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:30.970]
25 and why not?

[00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:31.910]
We love Shakira.

[00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:33.490]
She only had 11 votes the first time.

[00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:34.370]
And the whole poll.

[00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:38.550]
Jennifer Aniston, who, yeah, she had 14, the first poll.

[00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:39.610]
She's already got 21.

[00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:43.290]
You don't think that's because she's been in the news a lot lately and she's been locked in the basement.

[00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:44.810]
No, that's not because they're in the news.

[00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:45.330]
We locked.

[00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.030]
Heather Lockley or 20, Dali Parton 20.

[00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:52.290]
And again, George is very dismayed about the other corner stand.

[00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:53.530]
Sure, I'll take a look at him.

[00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:55.270]
But no, I agree.

[00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:58.290]
You could go watch LC DeBoard and Cower Oprah and see a similar situation.

[00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:59.150]
Ooh.

[00:18:59.670 --> 00:18:59.990]
All right.

[00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:02.890]
Or you can just go back in the sales department if you want to see big boobs.

[00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:03.390]
Hang about.

[00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:05.570]
Dali Parton, she had 29 the first time.

[00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:06.490]
She's got 20 already.

[00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:07.290]
She had...

[00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:07.430]
What?

[00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:08.970]
Yeah, she's moving on up.

[00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:10.450]
Anna Cornelhoid, 20.

[00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:16.130]
Now, she came in second the first time but she's slipping badly because most of the guys realized that she's got pre-trunks for leg.

[00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:16.970]
That's right.

[00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:18.230]
I'm telling you, she's...

[00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:19.530]
I'm looking at a post-18.

[00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:19.650]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:21.530]
Was Beyonce on the first one?

[00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:22.210]
I don't know.

[00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:22.730]
She must have been.

[00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:23.790]
She must have been.

[00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:26.610]
She only had six votes the first time.

[00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:27.290]
Now, she's got 18.

[00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:29.090]
Sandra Bullock, 17.

[00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:30.230]
I don't understand that.

[00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:30.810]
Right.

[00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:31.350]
I don't know.

[00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:32.750]
She did much better the first time.

[00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:33.510]
She was way up there.

[00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:36.570]
Since she fell on the stairs, because she's already...

[00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:37.670]
She's only got 15.

[00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:39.610]
There goes Sandra.

[00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:41.230]
To me, she's like...

[00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:41.990]
I mean, what do I know?

[00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:42.250]
You know?

[00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:44.130]
But to me, she seems so...

[00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:46.170]
Frigid.

[00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:46.950]
Cold.

[00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:49.350]
I mean, cutesy, but definitely not sexy.

[00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:50.230]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:51.610]
She seems in a sexual way.

[00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:52.450]
Like, sterile.

[00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:54.290]
She's, you know, like too clean.

[00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:54.590]
Yeah.

[00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:55.210]
Exactly.

[00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:56.550]
And an antiseptic.

[00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:57.550]
Anaceptic.

[00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:57.950]
That's it.

[00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:59.510]
Not to be confused with Anna Cornelhoid.

[00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:01.350]
Barbara Eden 14.

[00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:03.370]
Well, the genie came out of the bottle and make it.

[00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:03.710]
I wish.

[00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:06.050]
Friggy's spirit is salamete a trace.

[00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:06.510]
Yeah.

[00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:07.090]
Oh my goodness.

[00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:08.230]
13 votes she had.

[00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:11.890]
I heard she had, if the one three, the first time, but with the one after it, 131.

[00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:12.450]
Uh-huh.

[00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:14.810]
And as she's only got 13, boy, you got what it used to be.

[00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:15.590]
She's gived out.

[00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:16.370]
Tainted goods.

[00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:17.350]
Oh, God.

[00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:19.070]
Uh, Jerry Ryan 12.

[00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.910]
I don't know who that is.

[00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:22.170]
She was on a Star Trek series.

[00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:24.610]
She's done some other, uh, like, TV stuff.

[00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:25.050]
Sit cozy.

[00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:25.610]
I see.

[00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:27.010]
Well, she had 25 of first times.

[00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:27.870]
So she's consistent.

[00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:28.670]
Faith Hill 12.

[00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:30.530]
Sarah Michelle Jeller 11.

[00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:32.450]
What about that bits that we all hate?

[00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:34.050]
What tells her name that I always miss her name up?

[00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:35.070]
I don't know.

[00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:35.710]
Can you hit?

[00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.270]
Oh, yeah.

[00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:37.250]
You know who I'm talking about.

[00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:38.950]
Really, Nidalee Nasty knows.

[00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.950]
Uh-uh.

[00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:41.650]
Jessica Biel 10.

[00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:42.630]
I got to be honest with you.

[00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:43.010]
Okay.

[00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:45.370]
Because I know good looking people when I see him.

[00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:48.410]
And I, I just checked out the website just to make sure that I wasn't dreaming.

[00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:49.690]
She ain't much Jessica Biel.

[00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:50.190]
Oh, sorry.

[00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:51.610]
She looks like Howard G.

[00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:52.030]
He's phenomenal.

[00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:52.810]
I don't know what she's doing.

[00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:53.770]
No, she's not phenomenal.

[00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:55.670]
Go, do a Google on that, bitch.

[00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:56.230]
Look at her.

[00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:58.270]
She's got her own page with all these photos, you know.

[00:20:58.450 --> 00:20:59.330]
I'll send you some pictures.

[00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:00.490]
Oh, I see.

[00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:04.330]
Uh, by the way, I just want to take this opportunity to point out that you misspelled her name

[00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:05.570]
since you always do it to me.

[00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:06.170]
No, no.

[00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:07.030]
I picked Eric's fault.

[00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:07.970]
Oh, yeah.

[00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.490]
I picked it.

[00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:08.590]

[00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:09.770]
I picked it.

[00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:11.650]
Uh, B-E-A-L-E.

[00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:12.450]
Like Howard's wrong.

[00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:12.950]
That's wrong.

[00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:14.410]
B-E-E-L.

[00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:15.550]
B-E-L.

[00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:17.310]
That's how he spelled it.

[00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:17.710]
No, no.

[00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:18.690]
That's how it is spelled.

[00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:20.330]
That's how he spelled it.

[00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:20.350]

[00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:20.430]

[00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:20.430]

[00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:21.490]
B-E-A-L-E.

[00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:22.130]
Who did?

[00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:22.690]
You did.

[00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:23.310]
Yeah.

[00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:24.950]
Just, you know, point out your mistakes.

[00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:25.930]
Up yours.

[00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:27.370]
Wait until you see the next trick.

[00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:28.190]
I'll decimal points.

[00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:30.670]
I told you it's a bad idea to point out of the steak stretch.

[00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:34.970]
That was a big mistake.

[00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:35.410]
Yeah, it was.

[00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:36.230]
I tried to tell you that.

[00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:37.390]
No, you're right.

[00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:38.570]
I'm going to slow learner.

[00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:40.470]
Uh, Jessica B-E-A-L-E.

[00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:41.490]
I'm at how you just spell it.

[00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:42.570]
And she's still on the effect rate.

[00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:43.570]
Daisy point, Daisy point.

[00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:44.450]
So, Fia, I'm here.

[00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:45.230]
I don't trust you.

[00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:46.090]
She don't look that great.

[00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:47.510]
She's, she's, she's the number one.

[00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:48.250]
She's the number one.

[00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:48.850]
She's the number one.

[00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:49.870]
She's the number one on the poll.

[00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:50.990]
She's your vote?

[00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:53.850]
Well, I voted for Shakira because, uh, whatever.

[00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:55.210]
To make me happy, yeah.

[00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:56.470]
Nikki Cox, 10.

[00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:58.090]
Mariah Carey is scary, 9.

[00:21:58.250 --> 00:21:59.450]
Now, that is scary.

[00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:00.490]
That, that should be illegal.

[00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:03.570]
Uh, Tiffany, in fact, she should never be allowed to take her clothes off.

[00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:06.270]
Tiffany Amber Thieson 9, Cindy Margolis 8.

[00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:07.970]

[00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:20.650]
We could put with a tennis trick.

[00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:22.170]
T. L. E. O. Neat 3.

[00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:23.190]
I don't even know what she looks like.

[00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:24.390]
Somebody else, who Maria Hingus?

[00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:25.790]
Yeah, somebody with a lot of honor.

[00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:27.190]
Like the governor, California.

[00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:30.470]
T. L. E. O. Neat 3, Vivica Fox 3, Tara Banks 3,

[00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:32.190]
How about Stanley Banks?

[00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:33.150]
I think he's dead.

[00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:35.430]

Her name's Hasselbeck now.

[00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:44.710]
Probably should be.

[00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:46.250]
It means that Elizabeth Filarski.

[00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:47.330]
Oh, she got married.

[00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:49.230]
And got a two-pitter name.

[00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:50.990]
Not to David Hasselbeck off.

What is it again?

[00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:58.290]
Gay Hart has got one.

[00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:00.050]

[00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:00.450]

[00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:00.450]

[00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:00.450]

I'm gay.

[00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:03.910]
None.

[00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:05.130]
I hate this pool of none.

Need Campbell None.

[00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:08.410]
And Jules Asner None.

[00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:09.550]
Ed Asner, I don't have any either.

[00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:10.650]
Although that would be kind of funny.

[00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:11.530]
That'd be a hoot.

[00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:13.710]
I guess if I could see Ed Asner, Nick,

[00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:14.950]
it would make me feel better about myself.

[00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:15.790]
Although not too much.

[00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:15.790]

[00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:16.310]
All of us.

Don't forget, Gildi, we got that big Panther Ranger game tonight.

[00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:21.830]
Any interest?

[00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:22.070]
No.

[00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:22.810]
It's going to be big.

[00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:23.870]
It's big and big.

[00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:27.330]
If you want a big, big, big out, man, the Animal Coast is where you'll always find it.

[00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:28.510]
I mean, we're talking about a feast.

[00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:29.630]
Bring a hearty appetite.

[00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:30.790]
And just a few bucks.

[00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:31.570]
That's all it costs.

[00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:34.070]
The Animal Coast is Florida's number one Asian-Groway buffet.

[00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:37.030]
That's what they say is to get restaurant review and that's on I-Tedic, because I've eaten

[00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:37.750]
there a zillion times.

[00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:40.110]
And boy, everything is fresh, crunchy, delicious.

[00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:43.670]
There's nothing soggy and the moushy sitting out there for hours at the Animal Coast.

[00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:47.470]

By the way, when you go to the Animal Coast and you see Richard, Tom, the Leafs really suck.

[00:23:56.090 --> 00:24:00.150]
Every night at the crab fest with lasking snow crab, legs dungeon is crab and Jonah stone crabs.

[00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:11.970]
The Animal Coast also serves juicy New York sticks, cooked away 11-and-hand car prime rib.

And zillions and zillions of Chinese and other delights too.

[00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:19.450]
And on the weekends for dessert, be sure and leave some room for the Animal Coast famous 40-inch chocolate fountain.

[00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:20.610]
It is huge.

[00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:24.930]
You can hand dip your own strawberries, marshmallows, other decadent treats, shove those babies right in there.

[00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:31.190]

[00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:10.070]
Yes, you've heard about the place of Jesus on a piece of toast, the place on a bagel, even on a potato chip.

[00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:15.650]
Now you can eat like the King of Kings with a new God of Puckets,

[00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:22.870]
little round taste treats with a plaky crusts and the place of God, or maybe with an elephant, on us.

[00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:29.130]
Just lay your hands on the benton in the toe of them, and in just minutes they are hot as hell.

[00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:30.410]
Jesus, are hot.

[00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:32.230]
Yes, you can have them for breakfast.

[00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:36.470]
Yes, has them for communion, or a heavenly midnight snack.

[00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:38.550]
Also available in kosher.

[00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:41.830]
When you smell the burning bush, you know they're ready.

[00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:45.970]
Go to pockets from the makers of Muhammad Bites.

[00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:49.770]
Right next to the pie, I'm mode in the priest's section.

[00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:50.530]
Say I mean.

[00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:52.950]
It's 1033, Amen.

[00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:57.690]
So George Fax is to tell me, and let's see, here's the facts first of all, and George has a comment.

[00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:01.030]
Jessica Alba's news is the facts from the sleeping dictionary, 2002.

[00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:03.290]
I saw the movie New Zealand last year, down under.

[00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:03.650]
Right.

[00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:04.670]
I saw all of them.

[00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:05.950]
It was an obvious body double.

[00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:06.650]
It wasn't Jessica.

[00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:07.270]
No, it was.

[00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:08.570]
They're kind of like, what's your name?

[00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:09.710]
What's your name?

[00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:10.050]
Legials.

[00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:10.570]
Right.

[00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:13.430]
Who wouldn't get naked in Lou Lagoon?

[00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:16.210]
I saw the movie too, and by the way, you know, they're dead.

[00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:20.810]
And don't anybody call in Halle Berry's, because we saw her Berry's in the monsters' balls a minute many times.

[00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:23.770]
We could probably put Lindsay Lohan on there.

[00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:25.610]
Okay, go ahead, Lindsay Lohan.

[00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:26.350]
Oh my God.

[00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:27.730]
Yeah, I want to see her naked.

[00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:28.910]
I want to see a lot of people.

[00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:32.750]
Well, it's upon a time, but then she got, I don't know, a washed out.

[00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:33.930]
What's your name?

[00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.590]
Hillary Duff.

[00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:36.150]
If you're going to put those kind of people on.

[00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:36.370]
Okay.

[00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:37.990]
You want to put Hillary Duff on there?

[00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:38.870]
How is she about 10?

[00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:39.310]
Yeah.

[00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:40.770]
Well, you probably want to see her naked.

[00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:41.310]
Yeah, okay.

[00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:43.190]
591 votes on there.

[00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:45.770]
And I know, seriously, how old is she about 18?

[00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:48.610]
I don't know, but every time we have one of these, you know, the same.

[00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:49.570]
She was to me, Hillary Duff.

[00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:50.590]
She was about 10.

[00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:51.450]
Yeah, she was about for me.

[00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:53.050]
But people walked her.

[00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:53.210]

[00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:55.450]
That's how the Siberian say, niche from here.

[00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:58.850]
Jessica Simpson, the two Jessica's are fighting it out.

[00:26:59.090 --> 00:26:59.490]
Big time.

[00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:00.570]
I got a good battle going on.

[00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:00.850]
It's good.

[00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:04.190]
As opposed to the first time when Brittany ran away from Antiquant and Hoya.

[00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:05.030]
Those were one, too.

[00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:06.310]
Boy, five, huh?

[00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:07.350]
I was going to say she's 19.

[00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:08.690]
Hillary Duff?

[00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:09.090]
Yes.

[00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:09.910]
You fairy.

[00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:11.290]
Duff is 19.

[00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:12.630]
I don't care who you are.

[00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:13.430]
You fairy.

[00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:13.710]
Wow.

[00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:15.370]
Well, I take a one thing that Duff might say.

[00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:18.070]
She came in this morning and gave me more double talk than Al Kelly.

[00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:20.410]
But a beat, but a boop, but a bit of it.

[00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:22.970]
He sure fits in that sale department like a rubber glove right now.

[00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:24.250]
Like a rubber glove in your...

[00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:24.590]
Wrecked him.

[00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:24.930]
Wow.

[00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:27.050]
And from what I hear, he's got plenty of expertise.

[00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:28.630]
W to QAN.

[00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:28.970]
Hello.

[00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:31.830]
QAN.

[00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:33.070]
Hey.

[00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:33.610]
Good morning.

[00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:34.070]
How you doing?

[00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:34.550]
Good.

[00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:36.050]
You don't want to surprise us.

[00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:36.850]
You don't do it.

[00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:37.710]
No, I don't.

[00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:38.830]
George does.

[00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:39.110]
No.

[00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:44.610]
George, when Junior Shotcone said, because I'm a langa.

[00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:47.430]
And I think that means calm of 50.

[00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:48.290]
I don't know.

[00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:49.650]
He don't know.

[00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.830]
What do you know about the story?

[00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:52.450]
Talk to some of the Ocarina's fans.

[00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:52.970]
Okay.

[00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:55.870]
So I guess I obligatory since you mentioned it.

[00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:57.510]
I got to do the story about the accrues ship.

[00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:58.630]
Look, I...

[00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:01.110]
Well, when I think about the new folks, what was in your money?

[00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:01.310]
Right.

[00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:06.630]
A Caribbean cruise vacation for more than 2600 people was over today after a fire ignited

[00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:11.830]
a board of cruise ship, charring 150 rooms and leaving a passenger dead and 11 people injured.

[00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:12.430]
Dead.

[00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:14.490]
The EAD in other words, ain't coming back.

[00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:18.210]
We believe the best course of action is to terminate the current cruise in Montego Bay,

[00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:20.190]
Princess Cruise, the seventh statement late yesterday.

[00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:24.130]
All passengers currently on board will be flown home of them over the next two days,

[00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:26.950]
and will receive a full refund of their cruise and their airfare.

[00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:29.050]
Well, isn't that awfully a gentile of them?

[00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:29.730]
How are Gentile?

[00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:34.750]
The rising sun, they showed a big charred spot on the star princess, evidence of the fire

[00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:36.590]
that broke out on the pre-don darkness yesterday.

[00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:41.510]
A large ship, looking like a fuel barge, was more alongside the star princess of the Montego Bay

[00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:42.130]
docks.

[00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:46.590]
About 1600 people expected to fly out today in the arrest tomorrow, said Paul Pentecook,

[00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:48.370]
to make his director of tourism mon.

[00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:52.630]
Four passengers were being treated today of Cornwall Regional Hospital on a hill overlooking

[00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:53.990]
the cruise ship in the harbor, he said.

[00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:59.150]
We consider ourselves very lucky, said Pemons Pass of Toronto, told the AP after he and his wife

[00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:02.050]
were evacuated yesterday with some other passengers from Toronto away.

[00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:05.450]
When we got out of our state room, there was someone lying in the hallway passed out.

[00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:08.110]
He was being attended to, but it was very, very scary.

[00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:10.850]
Kind of like Luca Bratzis, a very scary guy.

[00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:14.930]
A smoldering cigarette is suspected as the cause of the blaze, said Horace Peterkin,

[00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:19.170]
president of the Jamaica Hotel and Tourist Association, who toured the ship after it docked here.

[00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:24.050]
You know, all the flying that I've done over the years, cross the Atlantic and all over the US and Vegas and you know.

[00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:26.290]
Never saw anybody die on a plane.

[00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:28.250]
Never saw any fire on a plane.

[00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:30.710]
Any of these, all of these things.

[00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:32.330]
I've never seen anybody get raked at it on the plane.

[00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:32.870]
You know what I mean?

[00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:33.430]
Right.

[00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:34.270]
Or murdered.

[00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:37.350]
All these things that seemed to happen with fear of regularity on the cruise ships.

[00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:39.270]
But when you crunch the number, it said solely that.

[00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:41.110]
And on these certainly not-see news networks this morning.

[00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:43.070]
When you crunch the numbers, it's true, very small.

[00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:44.450]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right, bitch.

[00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:45.810]
When any of it, bubble head.

[00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:50.370]
This is the first time such a tragedy has occurred during the history of our company were devastated by the incident.

[00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:52.330]
The statement from Princess Cruz has said.

[00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:55.190]
Our heartfelt thoughts and prayers were those affected by the fire.

[00:29:55.190 --> 00:30:02.190]
Carl Angel, communications director for the Jamaican Polarysa identified the man who died as Richard Liffage, 75 of Georgia.

[00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:03.430]
All 75 of his old enough.

[00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:08.030]
Some media in the victim's home state said the name was spelled and put his age at 72.

[00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:10.190]
He collapsed aboard ship and died at the 30s.

[00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:11.270]
They're arguing about his spelling.

[00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:12.470]
They'll make their differences dead.

[00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:13.470]
The matter of how he was spelled.

[00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:19.290]
After the fire started around 3am, Thursday, passengers grabbed life jackets and raised two muster stations.

[00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:24.210]
Julie Benson spoke to him and for Princess Cruz's wishes owned by a mining-based cardinal corporation.

[00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:26.270]
Oh, yeah, the cardinal corporation.

[00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:27.810]
Evil doers.

[00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:29.730]
They put the Mickey in your life.

[00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:30.650]
They slipped it to you.

[00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:31.970]
The crew put out the fire.

[00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:36.530]
Then did a cabin by cabin search to check for victims and make sure that everyone else was safe, she said.

[00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:39.790]
The state princess, the star prince, is sailing from Grand Cayman to Jamaica.

[00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:41.830]
Oh, Grand Cayman, while they deserve it then.

[00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:44.970]
When the place started, reportedly built a cost of over $430 million.

[00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:48.710]
It has forced running pools, half of those restaurants, dining rooms, and a casino.

[00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:49.670]
A casino.

[00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:50.850]
It's just crossed for $6,000.

[00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:52.370]
Two theaters and several nightclubs.

[00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:55.030]
It stretches about three football fields long.

[00:30:55.550 --> 00:31:01.230]
David Halton was on his honeymoon when he and his rider walk in their cabin smelling smoke and hearing people running in the halls yelling fire.

[00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:03.650]
It's one thing to have a smoke in honeymoon, but that's carrying a little far.

[00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:04.910]
Everybody ran.

[00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:09.990]
There were people in nightgowns and robes because it happened so fast. Halton was said by phone from his niggrill hotel.

[00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:12.850]
The crew lowered life boats to the ship deck and instructed passengers.

[00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:20.230]
All the places in the world, and I haven't been in all that many, but it seems to me that the Caribbean is the most overrated of any place that I've ever been.

[00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:20.710]
Yeah.

[00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:22.930]
Well, there's a person who wants to go there.

[00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:23.390]
Huh?

[00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:25.210]
There's a reason for us to want to go there.

[00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:33.150]
I noticed that on the preceptal wheel torture that a lot of the trips which I guess is the real key point, they keep giving trips to the Caribbean.

[00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:36.790]
Like, hey, you're going to the Caribbean and I'm thinking of myself big, Simmons, man. Who cares?

[00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:38.990]
I'd rather take the cash. I'll speak in the medias.

[00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:42.390]
Unless there's some surprise every reason to believe in.

[00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:43.030]
But he probably would be.

[00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:47.410]
Good place for you, Rick. There's the half-reventilating Ricky Tiki-Sad, shares that jackass in summer Tennessee,

[00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:52.350]
with that, though, that brought the shot her, uh, minister husband, alleged, the pastor.

[00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:55.650]
She's going to be charged with first degree murder. Well, he probably had a coming.

[00:31:56.190 --> 00:32:00.030]
Speaking of that, oh, in a good old time religion, I got that atheist who had come up right after the break.

[00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:01.290]
A lot of stuff here today.

[00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:06.430]
And we got four full hours today before Gully at the end of the center, starts with at the Hockey and about hockey again.

[00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:09.230]
Hockey, hockey, hockey, that's why Green once said.

[00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:10.690]
Close personal buddy.

[00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:14.390]
20 before 11 at 560 WQM, market down on account.

[00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:18.510]
I'd never finished that thought before. Today is the day we take care of all family business on this show.

[00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:19.970]
You're right. I'm wrong.

[00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:20.590]
You didn't write it there.

[00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:21.050]
There it is.

[00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:23.830]
Yeah, did you write it down? Mark it on account. You're back at the table.

[00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:24.810]
I'm going to break it up.

[00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:30.330]
Today is the day. Neil finally, uh, emancipates himself from the stress and, uh, strike.

[00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:31.430]
Clean your brain.

[00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:32.290]
That's right.

[00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:32.990]
I don't care.

[00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:39.430]
I'm going to be just like the bees. They just like Joe Bell, just like Chris Jones, just like the sales department, the engineering department.

[00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:41.110]
I don't give a crap. How's that?

[00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:45.050]
That's my new model for the rest of this year and for the rest of my life. I don't give a good crap.

[00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:49.170]
That's it. We would have played that Chris Darden drop once upon a time. But, you know, no, yeah.

[00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:52.450]
Well, let's see how it out. It's got a masterful.

[00:32:52.450 --> 00:32:53.750]
No, no, wait. It's got what?

[00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:55.230]
A masterful leap.

[00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:56.170]
Oh, it's okay.

[00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:57.570]
Oh, it's your knee.

[00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:59.050]
I don't give a sh** anymore.

[00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.690]
That's okay.

[00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:01.130]
There's only two letters there.

[00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:02.230]
Shh. Don't say them.

[00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:04.250]
Uh, the rest of it's missing. That's fine.

[00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:06.370]
New vocars. Nice job. By the way, NeoJTrow.

[00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:07.730]
You and your girlfriend there.

[00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:08.550]
Oh, God.

[00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:11.710]
19-11, a QA and beach Ford has gone mad.

[00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:13.890]
It's madness and March all this month at beach Ford.

[00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:15.950]
They just missed having a record month last month.

[00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:18.070]
So they plan to break that record this month during March.

[00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:23.210]
Right now, extended camp Ford F-150s at beach Ford are as low as 249 bucks a month.

[00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:27.750]
You pay only $995 down plus fees with a proof credit in 39 monthlies.

[00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:28.610]
What's not to like?

[00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:31.290]
Madness and March at beach Ford means you've got to be mad.

[00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:36.490]
Not to take advantage of fantastic rebates and discounts up to $10,000 on all new and used vehicles.

[00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:40.010]
And if you're not in the market for a new car, but no somebody who will send them into beach Ford,

[00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:43.830]
because if they take the liberty during this month, beach Ford will send you $200 in cash.

[00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:50.270]
And because that money comes from their advertising budget, they won't tack the 200 bucks extra on your friends' price and make them a former friend.

[00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:51.850]
Don't miss out on this once-year event.

[00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:56.290]
Beach Ford's madness in March extended camp Ford F-150s as low as 249 a month.

[00:33:56.290 --> 00:34:01.410]
Discounts and rebates up to $10,000 and 200 bucks in cash just for referring a friend.

[00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:06.230]
So hurry on in, you'll find beach Ford two miles east of the Golden Glades on 163rd Street, Westix, and Highway.

[00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:09.790]
Here in Tia, I'll bet you Josh Deros' life on it.

[00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:11.570]
You'll love your beach Ford experience.

[00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:19.290]
This is Neil Roger returns to the owner of this, a spy 60-fam A.M.

[00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:21.190]
You can't.

[00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:24.230]
Where the bag is?

[00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:25.030]
You've failed.

[00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:30.290]
You've seen him on Channel 7 News.

[00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:32.210]
First, as a two-bit report.

[00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:37.250]
Now, as a two-bit anchor that wears more makeup than Tammy Febecker and Mary Kay combined.

[00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:39.270]
Rick Sanchez sings.

[00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:52.650]
Here are the dulcet tones of the men who brought you crime check.

It's not a good movie.

[00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:25.050]
It's not a good movie.

[00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:25.050]

[00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:25.050]

[00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:25.070]
It's not a good movie.

[00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:25.070]

[00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:25.330]
It's not a good movie.

[00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:25.430]

[00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:26.130]
It's not a good movie.

[00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:26.950]
It's not a good movie.

[00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:27.350]
It's not a good movie.

[00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:29.590]
It's not a good movie.

[00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:30.130]
It's not a good movie.

[00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:30.890]
It's not a good movie.

[00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:31.310]
It's not a good movie.

[00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:32.010]
It's not a good movie.

[00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:34.770]
It's not a good movie.

[00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:35.410]
It's not a good movie.

[00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:35.530]
It's not a good movie.

[00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:38.130]
It's not a good movie.

[00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:39.050]
It's not a good movie.

[00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:39.590]
It's not a good movie.

[00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:40.450]
It's not a good movie.

[00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:45.810]
It's not a good movie.

[00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:46.210]
It's not a good movie.

[00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:51.370]
It's not a good movie.

[00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:51.630]
It's not a good movie.

[00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:51.630]

[00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:51.630]

[00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:51.650]
It's not a good movie.

[00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:51.650]

[00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:51.670]
It's not a good movie.

[00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:51.670]

[00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:51.670]

[00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:51.850]
It's not a good movie.

[00:40:51.850 --> 00:40:52.750]
It's not a good movie.

[00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:52.790]
It's not a good movie.

[00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:53.570]
It's not a good movie.

[00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:55.330]
It's not a good movie.

[00:40:55.330 --> 00:40:56.010]
It's not a good movie.

[00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:58.070]
It's not a good movie.

[00:40:58.070 --> 00:40:59.190]
It's not a good movie.

[00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:02.350]
It's not a good movie.

[00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:05.370]
It's not a good movie.

[00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:07.370]
It's not a good movie.

[00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:09.690]
It's not a good movie.

[00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:11.710]
It's not a good movie.

[00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.790]
It's not a good movie.

[00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:16.030]
It's not a good movie.

[00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:19.830]
Even though atheists are a few in number, it says here, how do they know that?

[00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:22.190]
There's a lot of people say they're agnostic like George's.

[00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:23.570]
They lie even though they're really atheists.

[00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:24.590]
Yeah, that's what it is.

[00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:27.030]
Not formally organized and relatively hard to publicize.

[00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:28.490]
Not formally organized and relatively hard to publicize.

[00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:28.490]

[00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:28.850]
I sure they are.

[00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:30.350]
I guess these people don't know the Minnesota.

[00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:30.830]

[00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:30.830]

[00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:31.890]
It's right next door Wisconsin.

[00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:32.230]

[00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:33.910]
The American atheist and the gang lord.

[00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:34.710]
What is the name of the group?

[00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:36.470]
Oh, that's the freedom from religion.

[00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:37.750]
Freedom from religion foundation.

[00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:37.930]

[00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:38.910]
But that's an atheist organization.

[00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:40.110]
They're right there Wisconsin.

[00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:43.510]
They could throw a rock right across the lake to that from Minnesota.

[00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:44.350]
What about you, Indians?

[00:41:44.830 --> 00:41:48.250]
Their scene is a threat to the American way of life by a large portion of the American public.

[00:41:48.490 --> 00:41:52.590]
And of course, a large portion of the American public is, but what about brainwashed and ignorant and superstitious?

[00:41:53.290 --> 00:42:00.770]
Atheists who account for about 3% of the US population it says here offer a glaring exception to the rule of increasing social tolerance over the last 30 years.

[00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:07.750]
So 30 minutes is Penny Agile, associate society, sociology professor and the studies lead researcher Penny Agile.

[00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:12.450]
She also argues that today's atheists play the role that Catholics use and comments to play in the past.

[00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:15.870]
They offer a symbolic moral boundary to membership in American society.

[00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:21.970]
It seems most Americans believe that diversity is fine as long as everyone shares a common core values that may stem trustworthy.

[00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:25.130]
And in America that course historically been religious, she says.

[00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:26.390]
Oh, how sad.

[00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:34.990]
Many of the studies respondents associated atheism with an array of moral indiscretions ranging from criminal behavior to rampant materialism and cultural elitism.

[00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:39.470]
And she all believes a fear of moral decline in resulting social disorders behind the findings.

[00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:46.750]
Oh yeah, in a country where we're slaughtering people like cattle, we're shooting people up like killing pigeons in the park.

[00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:49.790]
And they're worried about a social decline, moral decline.

[00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:53.150]
Americans believe they share more than rules and procedures with their fellow citizens.

[00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:55.610]
They hear an understanding of right and wrong, as she said.

[00:42:55.890 --> 00:42:58.010]
And how could anybody know right from wrong unless you got the Bible?

[00:42:58.390 --> 00:43:01.390]
The good book says, still the children of their disobedience, still them to death.

[00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:06.290]
Our findings seem to rest on the view of atheists as self-interested individuals are not concerned with a common good.

[00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:07.930]
A lot of crock of crap that is.

[00:43:08.410 --> 00:43:13.910]
It seems to me that atheists are terrified for the common good and try to protect people from themselves, which is just the waste of time.

[00:43:14.130 --> 00:43:15.710]
It's like the QAIM thing, same thing.

[00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:28.370]
The research is also, I mean, what do you do with people that are inculcated with crap that are forced to repeat the same rituals over and over and over crossing themselves and doing the Hail Mary's and doing a whole Medrasim business there,

[00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:34.790]
just repeating the Koran over and over again, or going to shul and repeating a bunch of Hebrew words that they have no idea what they're like.

[00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:38.330]
By real Khatthad or no Aikasahoye, who knows what that means?

[00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:48.090]
The research is also found acceptance of rejection of atheists is related not only to personal religiosity, but also to one's exposure to diversity, education and political orientation,

[00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:53.930]
with more educated East and West Coast Americans more accepting of atheists than their Midwestern county parts.

[00:43:54.370 --> 00:43:56.510]
Still like them people at Omaha, I'm sure look at them.

[00:43:57.730 --> 00:44:04.270]
And as far as all this crap about moral value, Manero Horni is the most promiscuous people in a whole country.

[00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:06.170]
He's a more midwestern people.

[00:44:06.350 --> 00:44:08.530]
You know that from your days in Montana, I do.

[00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:09.510]
Oh brother.

[00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:13.990]
Those are the, what do they call her states, the corn fed states?

[00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:15.230]
No, the Bible bill.

[00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:16.430]
No, that's the South.

[00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:19.850]
No, no, that's not the South. The Bible bill is not the South.

[00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.990]
What are you talking about?

[00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:22.790]
Remember what I told you earlier, Josh, is degree.

[00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:25.950]
That's right. I'm sorry.

[00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:33.050]
The Bible bill is like the Midwest and parts of the South, like Tennessee, but it's like Oklahoma, which is South.

[00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:35.290]
But it's also like Nebraska, Iowa, huh?

[00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:36.410]
Yes.

[00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:37.870]
Is Nebraska in the South?

[00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.490]
Yes.

[00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:39.930]
Oh, compared to me, yes.

[00:44:40.330 --> 00:44:41.990]
Here's one that says, can you add this to the poll?

[00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:43.290]
None on my heterophimale.

[00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:44.130]
It says Lisa.

[00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:46.650]
I heterophimale who likes polls, she said that's cute.

[00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:49.210]
Well, we can put Tom Brady on there for you.

[00:44:49.310 --> 00:44:50.130]
Or maybe what's his name?

[00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:51.430]
I just said, what is his name?

[00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:52.030]
Petarast?

[00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:53.190]
Oh, I'm going to remember that?

[00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:54.470]
I don't know what his name is.

[00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:55.310]
That's strange name.

[00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:56.170]
He still looks pretty good.

[00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:56.690]
Sam.

[00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:57.830]
Sam and Dave.

[00:44:58.090 --> 00:45:01.050]
Sam and Dean from the, whatever that, the supernatural.

[00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:05.090]
When they sleep in the same room, by the way, Josh is very considerate that they may be doing something.

[00:45:05.810 --> 00:45:07.430]
And if so, he would like to see it.

[00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:09.850]
This is Neil Rogers.

[00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:10.930]
Oh my God.

[00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:17.850]
This is the Neil Rogers show.

[00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:18.150]
This is the one.

[00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:18.610]
This is the one.

[00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:20.630]
This is the one.

[00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:23.610]
Any questions?

[00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:30.350]
Tonight on another thrilling 24, Jack Bauer is faced with more than he bargained for.

[00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:34.170]
As someone is out to unleash a nuclear bomb.

[00:45:34.850 --> 00:45:35.890]
We're nerve-gassed.

[00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:38.370]
We're some other way for destruction only.

[00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:40.010]
He can see to you, can stop.

[00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:43.230]
But just as he has a lead, that person is shot.

[00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:44.970]
Or thrown down the well.

[00:45:45.970 --> 00:45:47.110]
Or the wife's killed.

[00:45:47.410 --> 00:45:50.750]
Because as he orbs, he was going to tell Jack what he needed.

[00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:52.810]
The answer is...

[00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:57.230]
Meanwhile, back in C2U, there's dirty work of looks.

[00:45:57.490 --> 00:45:59.330]
As someone's a double agent.

[00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:00.810]
They're a triple agent.

[00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:03.950]
Or a double triple agent, vice-removed.

[00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:07.250]
And then Jack has to shoot someone because they made it mad.

[00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:11.530]
When I wouldn't talk, or just because they deserve killing.

[00:46:12.350 --> 00:46:13.390]
That's the story.

[00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:17.170]
Tonight and every Monday only on 24.

[00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:19.010]
And only on 5.

[00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:22.210]
It's 11.15.60 W.D.Q.A.M.

[00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:28.530]
So anyway, George emails me a whole bunch of photos of Jessica Beale, including her with a song and a dance about.

[00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:30.510]
She was the chick on 7th Heaven, well good for her.

[00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:31.250]
She's okay.

[00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:32.350]
I want to pick her up.

[00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:34.530]
She looks like she's all sweaty. That's why you like that picture.

[00:46:34.850 --> 00:46:35.250]
That's right.

[00:46:35.590 --> 00:46:36.470]
She's got a good hooter.

[00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:38.610]
She's saying, yeah, her body's better than her face.

[00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:39.290]
Let me put it out.

[00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:39.790]
She's okay.

[00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:40.730]
Let me say it again.

[00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:42.010]
Her body's better than her face.

[00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:43.370]
She's all right.

[00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:48.390]
But if you want to see some grainy nasty pictures of her, so will the real Jessica Beale please undress.

[00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:50.750]
Now what about that Jewels Asner chick?

[00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:52.430]
What kind of a name is that for a lady?

[00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:53.190]
Jewels.

[00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:55.610]
I don't know what kind of a name it is, but-

[00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:56.470]
Well, she don't have any votes.

[00:46:56.610 --> 00:46:57.070]
I'll tell you that.

[00:46:57.210 --> 00:46:58.110]
Great. Nobody knows who she is.

[00:46:58.210 --> 00:46:58.990]
She's on a nude.

[00:46:59.610 --> 00:47:00.230]
Yeah, that's who.

[00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:01.930]
She was old as a head asner.

[00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:02.770]
I doubt it.

[00:47:03.250 --> 00:47:04.070]
She don't have any votes.

[00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:05.110]
Neither does Lauren Holley.

[00:47:05.330 --> 00:47:05.670]
Neither does none.

[00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:06.750]
I'm a heterosexual female.

[00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:08.030]
Well, how do you like that?

[00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:08.670]
What is that?

[00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:12.130]
We have no heterosexual females now that we put that on there for Lisa who had-

[00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:12.690]
It was a good point.

[00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:13.330]
We left that off.

[00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:14.890]
I mean, we've even got-

[00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:16.550]
I'm sure that I hate this poll is doing okay.

[00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:17.210]
Where is it?

[00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:19.570]
I hate this poll 12.

[00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:19.890]
See?

[00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:20.970]
And none of them I'm gay.

[00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:21.630]
Nine.

[00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:23.770]
Oh, nine reminds me of Robert Creepie.

[00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:24.250]
Yeah, I know.

[00:47:24.610 --> 00:47:25.590]
And the question, two.

[00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:30.570]
56670560, pound 560 on the Verizon and Singular wireless line.

[00:47:30.810 --> 00:47:30.930]
Gay.

[00:47:31.810 --> 00:47:32.370]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:33.370]
Green.

[00:47:34.850 --> 00:47:35.770]
How are you, sir?

[00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:36.450]
Okay.

[00:47:36.450 --> 00:47:37.070]
Good.

[00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:41.950]
Joel Zazner, UCIe, she is Ed Azner's daughter-in-law.

[00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:43.770]
She's a hazard by marriage.

[00:47:44.130 --> 00:47:44.590]
I see.

[00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:46.910]
And she's actually me, if you ask me.

[00:47:48.810 --> 00:47:51.130]
And the same for Jessica Beel, sir.

[00:47:51.170 --> 00:47:52.330]
You're actually right about her.

[00:47:52.850 --> 00:47:53.830]
I just-

[00:47:53.830 --> 00:47:54.430]
I am-

[00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:54.590]
Overrated.

[00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:56.990]
Fastly, vastly.

[00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:57.950]
And you know what?

[00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:02.070]
Actually, but some of my best friends are.

[00:48:02.250 --> 00:48:03.090]
But listen, sir.

[00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:06.430]
You talked several weeks ago about the-

[00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:08.390]
I have to go about parking the panther games.

[00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.830]
Yes.

[00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:13.830]
Are you aware that across street from Proclair Stadium there, the mix is building a super wall mart?

[00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:18.930]
And they will have to build the great wall of China to prevent people from parking there during the off-screen kick-

[00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:23.690]
Oh, well, that'd be bad if they will park at wall mart and come across to probably be shot at an eye street there.

[00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:27.430]
I think this is a trial balloon by H Wayne that if-

[00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:29.490]
Well, he's letting the panthers do this.

[00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:32.010]
If they can charge five bucks across the street from-

[00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:33.210]
10 from wall mart?

[00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:34.870]
At least, I would think.

[00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:35.870]
Well, I think-

[00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:36.010]
I-

[00:48:36.010 --> 00:48:42.130]
You're my birthday in February 29th and I consider your anniversary my gift every year and I appreciate everything you do.

[00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:43.750]
Well, thanks a lot, sweetheart. See ya.

[00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:44.470]
See ya.

[00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:44.970]
Bye.

[00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:47.690]
He's right and you're dropping all the middle gate.

[00:48:48.290 --> 00:48:50.650]
Yeah, he must be getting out to think gender-indicisive deals hot.

[00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:52.390]
Or blind or something like that.

[00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:55.450]
Well, the pictures you sent me leave me kind of limp.

[00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:57.270]
Now, well, what is this thing you just-

[00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.750]
Oh, isn't me.

[00:48:57.890 --> 00:48:58.450]
Somebody said-

[00:48:58.450 --> 00:48:58.890]
The Bible bell?

[00:48:58.990 --> 00:48:59.510]
The graphic, yeah.

[00:48:59.930 --> 00:49:00.250]
Okay.

[00:49:00.250 --> 00:49:00.870]
I put it in Wikipedia.

[00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:01.710]
Well, I guess what?

[00:49:01.850 --> 00:49:07.310]
This is not very good because it doesn't have Nebraska on there or Colorado or Wyoming or Idaho.

[00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:10.530]
Many of the states in the Midwest are also considered to be part of the Bible bell.

[00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:12.190]
Indiana is not included.

[00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:16.410]
It's got a black and then of course South Florida is left out of the rest of Florida, right?

[00:49:17.070 --> 00:49:17.710]
It's from Wikipedia.

[00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:19.230]
Oh, it's from Wikipedia.

[00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:20.010]
We'll work this.

[00:49:20.570 --> 00:49:21.550]
This just-

[00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:23.050]
I guess that's supposed to be-

[00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:24.730]
Well, of course the deep South, we know that.

[00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:26.690]
But the Bible bell is another way-

[00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:28.270]
They do a Google on it and see what it says.

[00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:28.950]
All right.

[00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:30.810]
I'll do a Google on it right now.

[00:49:30.810 --> 00:49:31.490]
Do do that.

[00:49:31.610 --> 00:49:34.770]
The Jules Aznaram getting some pictures of the Jules Azar.

[00:49:35.010 --> 00:49:36.090]
How many sawdows?

[00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:36.850]
Of Jules?

[00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:38.210]
Pretty sure I was just-

[00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:39.570]
It's like gay guy that just called him-

[00:49:39.570 --> 00:49:41.590]
He was Mia so he's either blind or gay or both.

[00:49:41.610 --> 00:49:42.070]
Oh, he said Jessica Beale.

[00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:43.270]
He said both of them.

[00:49:43.350 --> 00:49:43.850]
No, he said-

[00:49:43.850 --> 00:49:44.170]
Oh, okay.

[00:49:44.370 --> 00:49:47.410]
He said Jules Azar is Mia's supposed Jessica Beale saw the blind gay guy.

[00:49:47.550 --> 00:49:47.550]

[00:49:47.850 --> 00:49:48.550]
Wikipedia, the-

[00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:49.630]
I don't want that.

[00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:50.390]
Don't get that.

[00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:54.530]
An area in which evangelical Protestantism is a pervasive or dominant part of the culture.

[00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:57.750]
The best known Bible bell covers the number of Midwestern and Southern states.

[00:49:58.410 --> 00:49:59.810]
Midwestern and Southern states.

[00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:00.330]
Okay.

[00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:02.350]
Bible bells can also be found-

[00:50:02.350 --> 00:50:03.130]
Oh, this one I see-

[00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:04.310]
This is where this picture came from.

[00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:05.870]
Because the same thing is popping up here in red.

[00:50:06.350 --> 00:50:08.990]
Bible bells can also be found in other countries including Canada,

[00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:13.310]
OEO, Horton, Lekin, Albertall, and Cowboys, Australia, and some parts of Europe.

[00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:17.710]
The name derives from the perceived overriding importance of the Christian Bible

[00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:19.970]
among evangelical Christian thought and practice.

[00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:22.030]
And the U.S. is stronghold of the Bible bell,

[00:50:22.070 --> 00:50:25.810]
the stipulate you see in the South through the colonial foundations of Protestantism

[00:50:25.810 --> 00:50:27.070]
and the culture of the religion.

[00:50:27.070 --> 00:50:31.050]
Major forms were tied water anguicism after the Church of England and

[00:50:31.050 --> 00:50:33.630]
after the Church of Scotland.

[00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:34.530]
Oh, the Scottish.

[00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:36.330]
I thought they all got killed off.

[00:50:36.850 --> 00:50:37.950]
Oh, I see it like here.

[00:50:39.210 --> 00:50:42.450]
Kansas, Virginia, Northern Florida, Tennessee.

[00:50:42.930 --> 00:50:44.070]
Oh, yeah, hallelujah.

[00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:46.750]
Oh, this is pretty interesting.

[00:50:46.890 --> 00:50:49.450]
Oklahoma which I mentioned to you, or O'Rourke, Ainal Roberts is there.

[00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:49.790]
Right.

[00:50:50.530 --> 00:50:52.910]
Texas goes about misery.

[00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:54.850]
And would you say misery is in the South?

[00:50:54.850 --> 00:50:56.710]
It's like, right, and to me misery is in the Midwest.

[00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:59.070]
It's like that that's the Scent Center of the County of Missouri.

[00:50:59.490 --> 00:51:00.230]
Show me where it is.

[00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:00.710]
Right.

[00:51:01.110 --> 00:51:01.850]
The show it to me is there.

[00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:05.970]
In Canada, the term is also sometimes used to describe several disparate regions

[00:51:05.970 --> 00:51:08.630]
which have a higher than average level of church attendance.

[00:51:09.130 --> 00:51:13.310]
Oh, these include the majority of rural southern Alberta and Sats-Ketjuan,

[00:51:13.710 --> 00:51:16.190]
parts of the Manitoba, the Fraser Valley of British Columbia,

[00:51:16.570 --> 00:51:19.430]
the Annapolis Valley of Nova Scotia, MSB, where Fraser Downs is,

[00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:21.890]
and the St. John River Valley of New Brunswick.

[00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:25.870]
In Australia, the term usually refers to tracks within individual cities.

[00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:30.110]
For example, the Northwestern suburbs of Sydney focusing on the Bacchum Hills,

[00:51:30.570 --> 00:51:32.970]
and Northeastern suburbs of Adelaide focusing on Paradise,

[00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:37.370]
Mord Modbury, and Golden Grove, coconut grove, whatever.

[00:51:38.250 --> 00:51:39.830]
Okay, see the Bible Bill.

[00:51:40.610 --> 00:51:41.630]
It's all over the day.

[00:51:42.070 --> 00:51:45.550]
See, the thing about the Bible Bill is those folks are generally loosening their belt

[00:51:45.550 --> 00:51:46.630]
and doing a lot of that stuff.

[00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:47.170]
Yeah, they are.

[00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:48.590]
I mean a lot with animals too.

[00:51:48.590 --> 00:51:52.370]
With anything, anything that's moving or an even a stationary like a tree.

[00:51:52.590 --> 00:51:53.790]
Well, they're animals anyway, so.

[00:51:54.090 --> 00:51:55.430]
Let them lose their souls.

[00:51:56.050 --> 00:51:57.550]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:51:57.730 --> 00:52:00.630]
Well, I got this pretty interesting, and it's by the fact you kept going like that,

[00:52:00.670 --> 00:52:01.950]
just because you don't like just a bill.

[00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:04.070]
I mean, you don't think that's a bill.

[00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:05.370]
It's because it's hot as a firecracker.

[00:52:05.530 --> 00:52:07.030]
Does that make you, is that what it is?

[00:52:07.530 --> 00:52:08.530]
I mean, this bad eye said.

[00:52:08.650 --> 00:52:09.510]
Or maybe this bad taste.

[00:52:09.810 --> 00:52:10.110]
I don't know.

[00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:12.250]
There are people with bad heart attacks, blurry vision.

[00:52:12.370 --> 00:52:12.950]
Is that what it is?

[00:52:13.090 --> 00:52:13.510]
That's it.

[00:52:14.970 --> 00:52:14.970]

[00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:16.710]
WQYM, hello.

[00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:18.750]
Not quite familiar with this word.

[00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:19.750]
Okay, we are.

[00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:20.610]
We're familiar.

[00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:23.190]
AESS, that's the first syllable.

[00:52:23.850 --> 00:52:25.030]
Come in QYM, hello.

[00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:26.690]
Yeah, John.

[00:52:28.530 --> 00:52:29.650]
No, this is Neil, aren't John?

[00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:31.230]
Hey, Neil, how are you?

[00:52:31.530 --> 00:52:31.850]
I'm good.

[00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:33.850]
What should I do with you every time?

[00:52:34.310 --> 00:52:38.470]
Hey, Neil, the Bible bell, I can confirm the brascist is part of it.

[00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:39.110]
It's Missouri.

[00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:40.970]
It was the Missouri.

[00:52:41.590 --> 00:52:42.850]
Is that the Taiwan?

[00:52:43.290 --> 00:52:45.530]
Well, it's so the Nile would Tennessee for sure.

[00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:47.990]
Indiana.

[00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:50.530]
Indiana, Oklahoma, Mississippi, and Alabama.

[00:52:51.310 --> 00:52:51.490]
Right.

[00:52:51.970 --> 00:52:54.670]
Okay, but it doesn't go any further north of the Mason Dicks.

[00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:56.430]
That Bible felt strong in Tennessee.

[00:52:57.110 --> 00:52:59.350]
Well, it doesn't go north of the Mason Dicks in line.

[00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:01.610]
I thought the Nebraska was so certainly north of the Mason Dicks in the United States.

[00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:02.790]
You got it.

[00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:05.550]
So it was Iowa and so it was Montana.

[00:53:06.030 --> 00:53:07.390]
But I grew up with the brass man.

[00:53:07.610 --> 00:53:08.250]
I saw you.

[00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.490]
It's a Wyoming.

[00:53:08.910 --> 00:53:09.950]
It's a Bible bell, buddy.

[00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:10.730]
Where are we?

[00:53:10.830 --> 00:53:11.410]
What do you think?

[00:53:11.610 --> 00:53:11.930]
You're in the Brazilian.

[00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:12.470]
It's a Shelby.

[00:53:12.970 --> 00:53:13.590]
Yeah, it's a religion.

[00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:15.470]
Religion starts south in Nebraska.

[00:53:15.570 --> 00:53:16.570]
That's all I could tell you.

[00:53:16.930 --> 00:53:17.850]
Hey, I like Nebraska.

[00:53:17.930 --> 00:53:18.990]
It's okay with me, man.

[00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:20.330]
I was in the United States World Series.

[00:53:20.650 --> 00:53:22.810]
It was off the state call out to their anymore.

[00:53:22.930 --> 00:53:24.050]
They tore it down years ago.

[00:53:24.190 --> 00:53:25.090]
How about Cassios?

[00:53:25.890 --> 00:53:26.930]
I can't see it still there.

[00:53:27.810 --> 00:53:31.510]
So it's not neatly as in and saying, but all the good steak houses report.

[00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:34.050]
And if you're sorry, but they're the racetracks not there anymore either.

[00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:35.110]
No, not at all.

[00:53:35.250 --> 00:53:37.150]
And that's Nebraska spelled backwards, you know?

[00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:39.110]
I know, but you're pretty smart.

[00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:41.250]
Okay, me on my info that I already know.

[00:53:41.250 --> 00:53:43.130]
Thanks a lot, paliers and Nebraska guy,

[00:53:43.210 --> 00:53:44.410]
ex-Serb and Gilson Gatardo.

[00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:45.490]
It didn't, he was good.

[00:53:46.510 --> 00:53:47.770]
Tony, we've had some great causes.

[00:53:48.050 --> 00:53:50.190]
We can use such a hard ass for the poll.

[00:53:50.410 --> 00:53:53.530]
Victoria Secret Model Adriana Lima, the sexiest is VP.

[00:53:54.190 --> 00:53:54.270]
Okay.

[00:53:54.590 --> 00:53:56.370]
Adriana Lima seeking the Tony Lima.

[00:53:56.370 --> 00:53:57.730]
The, uh, what was your golfer?

[00:53:57.890 --> 00:53:58.490]
Yeah, he qualifies.

[00:53:58.990 --> 00:53:59.250]
Lima.

[00:53:59.630 --> 00:54:00.550]
See, she's from Peru.

[00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:01.550]
Maybe she's Peruvian.

[00:54:01.690 --> 00:54:02.130]
Sounds like it.

[00:54:02.590 --> 00:54:03.130]
Adriana Lima.

[00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:04.390]
Never been to Peru.

[00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:05.530]
No.

[00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:07.330]
But what do you laugh about?

[00:54:07.330 --> 00:54:09.050]
I don't understand why you chuckle when I say this.

[00:54:09.050 --> 00:54:10.530]
You see that article about the atheists?

[00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:13.310]
The last paragraph was the real tell-all.

[00:54:13.410 --> 00:54:14.070]
That was the tip-off.

[00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:15.870]
The Americans tend to be very parochially

[00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:17.970]
no little about attitudes of people around.

[00:54:18.070 --> 00:54:20.530]
And those people are the ones who are like terrified of atheism.

[00:54:20.830 --> 00:54:23.530]
But if you go like to Western Europe, the whole religion thing is,

[00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:26.650]
most of the churches that are like that one bombed out one in Berlin, you know?

[00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:28.470]
It's the leftover hangover from WW2.

[00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:30.810]
There's nobody praying or worshipping in there,

[00:54:30.990 --> 00:54:32.910]
or like the old church in Amsterdam.

[00:54:33.550 --> 00:54:38.250]
The hookers are looking right across the, uh,

[00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:40.090]
Hershey Highway there.

[00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:41.010]
The hookers here.

[00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:42.410]
Right across the cobblestone road.

[00:54:42.590 --> 00:54:43.690]
Man, it got some bad streets.

[00:54:44.350 --> 00:54:46.790]
So I think, uh, they fixed up the route of gasoline to Warmerstreet.

[00:54:46.790 --> 00:54:48.910]
You can actually walk under and not fall down and break your neck.

[00:54:49.330 --> 00:54:51.430]
Well, a lot of guys fall down because they're busy looking in the windows.

[00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:52.590]
You know, looking in the hookers.

[00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.950]
Which I can understand.

[00:54:54.130 --> 00:54:55.470]
Although the ones there on the, uh,

[00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:56.930]
well, I don't know what the name of that street is.

[00:54:57.070 --> 00:54:59.610]
We're, uh, Kitty Corner, where Al Goldstein used to have the apartment.

[00:54:59.770 --> 00:55:00.670]
Use the apartment, remember?

[00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:01.190]
Uh-huh.

[00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:04.150]
Uh, there are higher class hookers, better hookers over there.

[00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:04.970]
Oh, man.

[00:55:05.250 --> 00:55:05.570]
Blonde.

[00:55:05.710 --> 00:55:05.930]
Well.

[00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:08.450]
Next time you guys go there, you'll be very impressed.

[00:55:08.610 --> 00:55:09.210]
Believe me.

[00:55:09.250 --> 00:55:09.670]
Get wait.

[00:55:10.070 --> 00:55:10.750]
I'm telling you, right?

[00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:11.070]
I don't know.

[00:55:11.370 --> 00:55:13.530]
They walk by the kind of tap on the window.

[00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:14.050]
Hi, honey.

[00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:15.890]
Uh, and I keep walking.

[00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:17.370]
712 votes.

[00:55:17.370 --> 00:55:18.750]
I keep, uh, thinking of myself.

[00:55:18.790 --> 00:55:20.390]
Boy, you're brocking up the wrong tree, honey.

[00:55:21.110 --> 00:55:21.790]
Well, they are.

[00:55:21.930 --> 00:55:22.810]
That's what the credit is.

[00:55:23.050 --> 00:55:23.050]

[00:55:23.050 --> 00:55:25.050]
21 Jessica Alba 60.

[00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:27.250]
What, which of these women would you like to see naked?

[00:55:27.250 --> 00:55:28.470]
Do you haven't seen naked already?

[00:55:28.690 --> 00:55:30.170]
Of course, some of these people in the audience,

[00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:32.110]
maybe they've seen them naked like I'm close and personal,

[00:55:32.110 --> 00:55:32.950]
but I sure doubt it.

[00:55:32.970 --> 00:55:33.670]
Yeah, some pictures.

[00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:34.230]
Yeah.

[00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:36.870]
Jessica Simpson 61 has moved into first place.

[00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:38.310]
She's a vote ahead of Jessica Alba.

[00:55:38.410 --> 00:55:39.690]
Wow, we got a horse race.

[00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:40.870]
We got a cat fight.

[00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:41.250]
Right?

[00:55:41.730 --> 00:55:44.170]
Barbara and Jennifer Bush, the president's daughter is 52.

[00:55:44.570 --> 00:55:46.690]
Just for old time's sake, just to piss him off.

[00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:47.610]
Let's see him naked.

[00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:48.730]
He and each other.

[00:55:49.070 --> 00:55:49.370]
Oh, all right.

[00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:50.430]
Jennifer loved you at 39.

[00:55:52.110 --> 00:55:53.970]
Yeah, that's what Josh is worried about.

[00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:56.090]
Those brothers in that show, he's very, very concerned.

[00:55:56.190 --> 00:55:59.150]
He spends a lot of time worrying about why are these two guys in their 20s?

[00:55:59.290 --> 00:55:59.670]
Well, probably.

[00:55:59.750 --> 00:56:00.450]
Yeah, they're about 40.

[00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:02.230]
I mean, you know, they're not about 40.

[00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:03.430]
Okay, we already been through this.

[00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:04.970]
The ones 23 and the other guys 28.

[00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:05.710]
What a Dean.

[00:56:06.810 --> 00:56:07.330]
It's easy.

[00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:08.010]
They're always old.

[00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:09.670]
I don't know what difference that would make.

[00:56:09.850 --> 00:56:13.610]
Is it more safe for guys, brothers, or 40 to be sleeping in the same room,

[00:56:13.610 --> 00:56:15.250]
where if they're like in their 20s, it's dangerous.

[00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:17.070]
The older you are, the gayer you are.

[00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:17.710]
No, I say.

[00:56:18.030 --> 00:56:18.030]

[00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:20.750]
Because it seems to me that if you watch that show at all,

[00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:23.490]
that they have no tangible means of income,

[00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:25.850]
they're always looking for dad, so they're not getting money from him,

[00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:27.510]
because they can't find him, whatever that's all about.

[00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:29.750]
And so they got to be like the frugal, man.

[00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:30.530]
Yeah, that's a good point.

[00:56:30.530 --> 00:56:31.530]
They're always on the road.

[00:56:31.530 --> 00:56:32.310]
They're traveling a lot.

[00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:33.750]
They've currently caused a gas.

[00:56:34.030 --> 00:56:34.910]
What do they do for money?

[00:56:35.250 --> 00:56:35.890]
I don't know.

[00:56:36.090 --> 00:56:37.330]
Well, I'd like to find out.

[00:56:37.630 --> 00:56:38.630]
That's actually a Sam.

[00:56:39.070 --> 00:56:43.190]
Oh, well, speaking of Mia since you stopped off right there at Sam and Dean.

[00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:46.010]
No, it's what's her three, three name names.

[00:56:46.050 --> 00:56:46.730]
Jennifer Love Hewitt.

[00:56:46.850 --> 00:56:47.470]
Jennifer Love Hewitt.

[00:56:47.730 --> 00:56:48.870]
You're doing really well on the poll.

[00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:50.590]
That's the definition of Mia's.

[00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:51.370]
I'm Mel C.

[00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:52.690]
Shakira 38.

[00:56:53.130 --> 00:56:54.050]
Anna Cornelhoia 29.

[00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:55.490]
I'll log Google her in a minute.

[00:56:56.030 --> 00:56:57.050]
The on-saint rolls 28.

[00:56:57.350 --> 00:56:57.750]
Sure.

[00:56:57.750 --> 00:56:58.130]
She's a fan.

[00:56:58.270 --> 00:56:59.750]
I had to care for her.

[00:57:00.510 --> 00:57:00.510]

[00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:03.750]
I had to care for her.

[00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:03.970]
She's a fan.

[00:57:03.970 --> 00:57:03.970]

[00:57:03.970 --> 00:57:03.970]

[00:57:03.970 --> 00:57:03.970]

[00:57:03.970 --> 00:57:04.090]
She's a fan.

[00:57:04.090 --> 00:57:04.170]
I had to care for her.

[00:57:04.170 --> 00:57:04.210]
She's a fan.

[00:57:04.210 --> 00:57:04.850]
I had to care for her.

I'm going to go to the police station

[01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:49.510]

[01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:49.510]

[01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:49.510]

[01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:49.810]
I'm going to go to the police station

[01:10:49.810 --> 01:10:51.350]
I'm going to go to the police station

[01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:52.870]
I'm going to go to the police station

[01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:57.470]
I'm going to go to the police station

[01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:59.450]
I'm going to go to the police station

[01:10:59.450 --> 01:11:00.230]
I'm going to go to the police station

[01:11:00.230 --> 01:11:01.730]
She's taping her elbow here

[01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:03.150]
She's taping her elbow is here

[01:11:03.150 --> 01:11:03.830]
All right, you'reLCCoAs

[01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:04.690]
Jessica Albbul is here

[01:11:04.690 --> 01:11:07.730]
Hey Jessica, Hey Danyway

[01:11:07.730 --> 01:11:09.570]
The house has already passed Sensenbrenner's bill

[01:11:09.570 --> 01:11:13.070]
In Senator Bill Fist To Republican tendencies who introduced a campaigning bill in the Senate

[01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:16.830]
That would also make it a felony to be in the West, without the proper paperwork George

[01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:17.730]
Tomorrow your papers?

[01:11:18.010 --> 01:11:19.490]
Yes, I do carry them with me every day

[01:11:19.490 --> 01:11:19.970]
Post who?

[01:11:19.970 --> 01:11:20.010]
The adult

[01:11:21.450 --> 01:11:22.290]
That's the one you need

[01:11:22.290 --> 01:11:22.570]
LIVE

[01:11:23.310 --> 01:11:27.810]
Sensenbrenner seemed to say that this bill would help regain control of our borders and prevent illegal immigration

[01:11:27.810 --> 01:11:30.690]
as well as help strengthen and promote our compassionate and welcoming

[01:11:30.690 --> 01:11:35.710]
legal immigration system. About 30,000 protesters through the

[01:11:35.710 --> 01:11:38.190]
march to downtown Milwaukee is part of a demonstration titled

[01:11:38.190 --> 01:11:41.870]
Day Without Latinos. Oh, can you imagine if we had a demonstration in South

[01:11:41.870 --> 01:11:46.970]
Florida called a Day Without Latinos? I think it would be a different kind of

[01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:49.990]
demonstration but a lot of people would show up. In which Latinos were

[01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:54.650]
encouraged, that's funny. We're encouraged to take time from their jobs to march

[01:11:54.650 --> 01:11:58.610]
according to voices of the opera antenna, which organized the event. If police

[01:11:58.610 --> 01:12:01.790]
spokesmen said the crowd is between 10 and 15,000 and they're saying,

[01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:04.590]
but, third man, doesn't the Milwaukee business is also closed

[01:12:04.590 --> 01:12:08.230]
this day in protest. A day without Latino is the theme, the theme of the Milwaukee

[01:12:08.230 --> 01:12:12.690]
protest barrows its name from the 2004 comedy called Day Without a Mexican, which

[01:12:12.690 --> 01:12:15.250]
California wakes up when they define its Hispanic residents have

[01:12:15.250 --> 01:12:19.350]
inexplicably disappeared and they're all going, oh, yeah, the Milwaukee

[01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:22.550]
march. So of course, then they can't get that cheap labor. That's right. The Milwaukee

[01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:25.610]
march was won a several recent protest organized across the nation by groups

[01:12:25.610 --> 01:12:29.090]
opposed to immigration bills considered by Congress. The Senate Judiciary Committee

[01:12:29.090 --> 01:12:33.150]
has till Monday devoted a competing legislation, but one Senate aid said the

[01:12:33.150 --> 01:12:36.670]
prospect on Senator taking action didn't seem bright. The aid call negotiations

[01:12:36.670 --> 01:12:41.090]
in a sense slow going and printed a slow down and showdown over the vote.

[01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:44.410]
Democrats are saying that the first and sends and measures go too far,

[01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:46.950]
especially the provisions that threaten to criminalize anyone who helps

[01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:50.910]
an undocumented immigrant like George. This bill would literally criminalize

[01:12:50.910 --> 01:12:53.810]
the goods to Merton and probably even Jesus himself said Hillary Clinton,

[01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:57.630]
little Hillary. The website for a voice a state law for Ontario, which in

[01:12:57.630 --> 01:13:00.970]
Spanish means voices from the border, no kidding. States that in addition to

[01:13:00.970 --> 01:13:03.870]
turning immigrants into felons and pressuring employers, since and writers

[01:13:03.870 --> 01:13:06.410]
bill could also affect immigrants driving privileges and emergency

[01:13:06.410 --> 01:13:09.490]
medical care. They've been a learned guest off Florida, man. The first thing you do

[01:13:09.490 --> 01:13:12.990]
with illegal aliens is give the driver's license and a beat up all 57 Chevy,

[01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:17.550]
right? Right. Now we're talking. The Iraq war is now as unpopular at home as

[01:13:17.550 --> 01:13:21.050]
the Vietnam War was in 1968, but in the absence of a military draft in a

[01:13:21.050 --> 01:13:25.070]
clear way out, Americans are taken to the streets, analysts say, except of course

[01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:28.710]
for those that they without Latino or people. Protests marking the third

[01:13:28.710 --> 01:13:31.750]
anniversary of the war due less than 10,000 people in major US cities

[01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:34.590]
over last weekend. According to reporters and police accounts, despite

[01:13:34.590 --> 01:13:37.890]
pull showing broad public displeasure with the war, well, the public is a little

[01:13:37.890 --> 01:13:42.090]
like, little a tharger. Compared to Vietnam, the Iraq war is remarkable for

[01:13:42.090 --> 01:13:44.830]
how quickly it lost public supports a John Mueller, a political scientist

[01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:48.630]
in a house at university who makes that possible anywhere near that green

[01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:52.090]
fields. By the way, George said at his publics, they were out of stock. They had

[01:13:52.090 --> 01:13:55.790]
they have been there, but no green fields. They had good where it had been. My

[01:13:55.790 --> 01:13:59.790]
blood sugar is great. I'm lost to five pounds. Man, I feel great. If I guess

[01:13:59.790 --> 01:14:02.350]
I'm going to have for lunch today about three thirty four o'clock. I have a

[01:14:02.350 --> 01:14:06.550]
man nice bowl of green fields pasta with meat sauce like olives. Oh, yeah.

[01:14:07.230 --> 01:14:11.190]
Fire that ground beef and little olio oliva with two thousand dead on this

[01:14:11.190 --> 01:14:14.130]
war supporters dropped to the point that it took 20,000 didn't be a nom at

[01:14:14.130 --> 01:14:18.270]
the time of the 10 offensive in 68 people AFP. But if Americans aren't marching in

[01:14:18.270 --> 01:14:21.110]
the streets to voice their discontent, it's largely because the alternative to

[01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:24.070]
war is not clear and because in the absence of a military draft, they're

[01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:27.610]
simply not affected by the conflict. This war is bad as it is, such as a

[01:14:27.610 --> 01:14:30.310]
first-muller percentage of the population and be a nom did since Charles

[01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:33.050]
Franklin, political science professor at the University of Wisconsin,

[01:14:33.230 --> 01:14:36.730]
Madison. You do see peace rallies on the Madison campus, but you don't see

[01:14:36.730 --> 01:14:39.950]
anything like the anti-Vietnam rallies and riots that you head back here in the

[01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:43.410]
sixties. Not one of our students is being drafted in the military, not many

[01:14:43.410 --> 01:14:46.630]
are volunteering also. You know that does dramatically reduce the self-interest

[01:14:46.630 --> 01:14:49.470]
that people have in opposing the war. It leaves you with core peace activists.

[01:14:49.470 --> 01:14:52.410]
They're a smaller group than certainly a son of 60s. Well, it's a different kind

[01:14:52.410 --> 01:14:57.490]
of America too. You had people all foaming in the head rebellion man, open

[01:14:57.490 --> 01:15:00.370]
rebellion. And of course, there was always Kent State and this one said, hey,

[01:15:00.410 --> 01:15:04.590]
rebel against this. And so peace activists mean while insist the anti-war

[01:15:04.590 --> 01:15:08.790]
movement is growing, Brian Becker of the anti-war coalition answer said the

[01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:11.350]
group decided to focus on neighborhood-based protests instead of

[01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:15.290]
mass mobilizations on the third anniversary of the war. At a rally in the

[01:15:15.290 --> 01:15:18.230]
working class, Bronx neighborhood of New York, 500 people marched through a

[01:15:18.230 --> 01:15:20.710]
busy commercial. There ain't got huge support. Everyone was waving,

[01:15:21.010 --> 01:15:23.710]
honking their horns and taking literature. He said, these are people who don't

[01:15:23.710 --> 01:15:26.770]
have the resources to get on a bus and come to Washington. Peace activists say

[01:15:26.770 --> 01:15:29.350]
their meetings are drawing new faces and protest opponents have all but

[01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:33.370]
vanished. A crowd of about 115 met in rural Parkersburg, West Virginia, near

[01:15:33.370 --> 01:15:37.170]
the home of war, here, O'Jessica Lynch for an anti-war rally on Sunday. They came

[01:15:37.170 --> 01:15:40.810]
to hear the Iraq and Iraq war veteran and the mother of a wounded soldier. For

[01:15:40.810 --> 01:15:43.570]
this area was a pretty big turnout said, well, over a lot of woodcounted

[01:15:43.570 --> 01:15:47.670]
Democrats, the county has lost three soldiers in Iraq. Another public

[01:15:47.670 --> 01:15:50.550]
opinion snapshot will come with an April 4th ring the troops home referendum

[01:15:50.550 --> 01:15:53.530]
being held in 32 municipalities in the West and Midwestern state of Wisconsin.

[01:15:54.030 --> 01:15:56.990]
Organizers say a signature gathering campaign in politically diverse parts of

[01:15:56.990 --> 01:15:59.450]
Wisconsin, put the issue on a ballot, but they have no idea about the

[01:15:59.450 --> 01:16:03.730]
actual. Bring the troops home. Amen. Now, right now, as far as the Iraqis are

[01:16:03.730 --> 01:16:05.550]
concerned, let them lose their souls.

[01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:10.310]
This is Neil Raj 27, the Israelis, the Arabs, if you want to have a good

[01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:15.210]
pass, they can still reach us alone. Oh, oops. Yeah. Thank God I said let me get

[01:16:15.210 --> 01:16:18.570]
around the Yard. Other side there. I think Tommy got killed the audio of all. Hey

[01:16:18.570 --> 01:16:22.070]
with that raspberry. Keep stalling. Keep stalling with what?

[01:16:23.330 --> 01:16:27.670]
I think Tommy done it. Don't you? And by the way, we can go.

[01:16:27.910 --> 01:16:33.050]
Here we go. Do you know who I am? I'm Mo Greene. I made my

[01:16:33.050 --> 01:16:34.950]
phone when you were going out with cheerleaders.

[01:16:42.990 --> 01:16:48.030]
What's the name of that thing? It's including both the sons in the past.

[01:16:48.710 --> 01:16:48.990]
What?

[01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:56.010]
Right on. What's important to a man? And what can he do down over his hands?

[01:16:56.590 --> 01:16:56.810]
What?

[01:16:57.690 --> 01:16:58.410]
Can he dig it?

[01:16:59.190 --> 01:17:02.310]
A man that shaft is one ring.

[01:17:03.390 --> 01:17:06.090]
One of them. Maybe just talking about my shaft.

[01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:11.650]
Until the surgery, all the ladies just pointed and laughed.

[01:17:14.190 --> 01:17:19.930]
Now my shafts and little crafts, their jobs and open wide as they get.

[01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:23.130]
Oh my God.

[01:17:24.410 --> 01:17:25.890]
Oh my God.

[01:17:25.890 --> 01:17:31.690]
Who you eyes at, it's 1146 14-dollard at UAM. This is one of my all-time favorite

[01:17:31.690 --> 01:17:35.410]
stories. You know they say the Lord helps those who help themselves. Well that's what the bush family does too.

[01:17:35.650 --> 01:17:36.790]
He's in the family.

[01:17:37.610 --> 01:17:40.570]
Remember we had a story about Bush's uncle the other day, right?

[01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:45.210]
Former First Lady Barbara Bush donated an undisclosed amount of money to the bush Clinton Katrina fund,

[01:17:45.370 --> 01:17:50.050]
with specific instructions that they might be spent with an educational software company owned by her son, Neil Bush.

[01:17:50.610 --> 01:17:51.510]
Oh God.

[01:17:52.110 --> 01:17:56.050]
Since then, the ignite learning programs been given to eight area schools that took in substantial

[01:17:56.050 --> 01:18:01.070]
numbers of Hurricane Katrina evacuees. Mrs. Bush wanted to do something specifically for

[01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:05.510]
education, specifically for the thousands of students flooding in the Houston schools, a Jean Becker,

[01:18:05.950 --> 01:18:11.590]
former President Bush who she for staff, Bush 1. She knew that HISD was using the software program and

[01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:15.530]
she's very excited about this program so she wanted to make it possible for them to expand the use of this program.

[01:18:15.530 --> 01:18:18.750]
I see. It's not the same program that our fat ass governor, Jim Bush,

[01:18:19.490 --> 01:18:21.890]
instituted in the state of Florida. Yes, it is. Yes.

[01:18:22.270 --> 01:18:24.770]
Which just happens to be developed by Neil Bush.

[01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:30.610]
Who would you say savings in low-scandal guy? Right from the Silverado.

[01:18:30.610 --> 01:18:32.890]
Oh, that's the same guy? That's the same guy.

[01:18:33.630 --> 01:18:35.210]
Yeah. Same Neil. Bush.

[01:18:35.690 --> 01:18:38.050]
Speaking of crazy people in Scientology. You're fray.

[01:18:38.370 --> 01:18:42.190]
When it comes to furniture at his love for Katie Holmes, Tom Cruise just couldn't help himself.

[01:18:42.830 --> 01:18:44.190]
What does he make me want to vomit?

[01:18:44.190 --> 01:18:46.450]
Yep. The mega star was the guest of honor.

[01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:48.830]
You know, it's what there's a lot of closet and famous people.

[01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:54.590]
Okay, and they do make me ill and they got all that money and they got nothing to lose and they got nothing but no balls at all.

[01:18:54.850 --> 01:18:57.410]
But the fact of the matter is he carries it to a new extreme.

[01:18:57.630 --> 01:19:03.430]
You know, even Tom Seleck didn't hold his name or Michael Jackson never held his many press conferences to deny that they were gay.

[01:19:03.650 --> 01:19:08.090]
Is this guy? I'm going to sue you. I'm going to sue you. Yeah, right. Sue this.

[01:19:08.450 --> 01:19:09.610]
I think he's a boy named Sue.

[01:19:09.610 --> 01:19:16.650]
The mega star was the guest honor at Yahoo's quarterly influential speakers event to his day at the company's headquarters in Sunnyvale, California.

[01:19:16.930 --> 01:19:20.210]
Batting with chief executive Terry Semel and answering questions from the crowd.

[01:19:20.690 --> 01:19:27.090]
After an impromptu arm wrestling match with Semel, Cruise justingly recreated his Oprah sofa hopping episode this time on a chair.

[01:19:27.550 --> 01:19:30.050]
The trumpet is joy about his fiance and their soon to arrive offspring.

[01:19:30.430 --> 01:19:34.010]
He believed me. He reminds me of George Bush, you know, keeps repeating it over and over.

[01:19:34.130 --> 01:19:39.590]
You believe me now? You've been buying it yet? No. Oh, then he brought the very pregnant homes onto the stage where he beamed in the house.

[01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:44.570]
He's been panning around belly probably the first time he touched her. And yes, he then sealed the overload with a kiss.

[01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:51.730]
Oh, that convinces me TV's inside edition broadcast a happy event last night. Aren't you excited about that?

[01:19:52.130 --> 01:19:57.230]
Through the old weather kiss. I can hear Brian Howland singing right now on dot records sealed with a kiss.

[01:19:57.950 --> 01:20:03.430]
Brian thought Bobby fit into that. No, he did that too, but I was a cover. You're right. Here's Brian Highland.

[01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:10.730]
I'm Brian. If you'll ever start you can do a Brian. Good God. Where's the reminded me a little bit of Brandon to Wilwell, but I hate my motive. He was like, he was alright.

[01:20:10.930 --> 01:20:13.210]
Hey Brian, come on. You can do it. There you go.

[01:20:13.390 --> 01:20:13.590]
Dave.

[01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:19.330]
By the way, speaking of Brian, tell chicken that his thing is in the air.

[01:20:19.610 --> 01:20:24.050]
Hey, your chicken that is in the mail and the grimace. Let's talk up.

[01:20:25.650 --> 01:20:28.850]
Nobody hits the post like that. I thought I heard Gary Louis.

[01:20:31.090 --> 01:20:32.490]
Gary Louis. Did this?

[01:20:33.150 --> 01:20:35.730]
Well, let me just have count me out.

[01:20:36.890 --> 01:20:41.990]
We don't want to hear Gary Lewis. You actually have Gary Lewis in the that wasn't a hit from 68.

[01:20:42.450 --> 01:20:43.950]
No, no. No.

[01:20:44.130 --> 01:20:45.030]
Tell us me it was a top 10.

[01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:48.790]
You know, I have it. It was a top 10 release.

[01:20:49.790 --> 01:20:52.810]
And then if that's not good enough, yeah.

[01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:57.790]
Bobby Vinton. Yeah, I'm so pretty.

[01:20:57.950 --> 01:21:02.830]
Who? Yeah. We just can't get another this out. I don't know how much bowling he didn't buckle with those white socks.

[01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:05.770]
Here he goes.

[01:21:05.970 --> 01:21:05.970]

[01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:08.650]
Oh, we got to say goodbye.

[01:21:09.650 --> 01:21:10.370]
Goodbye is a good idea.

[01:21:13.230 --> 01:21:16.790]
I don't see it. I'm sorry, but I don't see it. Well, I see over the kiss rate.

[01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:19.470]
Number no, it was in top 20. Got to be number 19.

[01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:22.610]
Okay. So I like 27 68 nine weeks.

[01:21:22.830 --> 01:21:25.810]
It was a rubber creeper favorite because it was weeks on the chart.

[01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:27.150]
The billboard chart. It's credible.

[01:21:27.430 --> 01:21:29.030]
So you can't miss with me. What are you eating now?

[01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:30.690]
I guess I was on the baker. What do you got?

[01:21:32.010 --> 01:21:33.190]
Pizza from Tony.

[01:21:33.910 --> 01:21:35.150]
Oh, well, we don't want to say that.

[01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:37.830]
Oh, and look at that. He also did.

[01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:42.090]
Gary Lewis must have had a thing for Brian Haaland because he also did save your heart for me.

[01:21:42.090 --> 01:21:46.610]
First recorded by Brian Haaland in 63 was the number one adult temperate for three weeks.

[01:21:46.750 --> 01:21:47.890]
Save your heart remember that.

[01:21:48.010 --> 01:21:50.030]
But you got it? Save your heart for me?

[01:21:51.370 --> 01:21:53.070]
Yeah. Well, that's cornball, man.

[01:21:54.050 --> 01:21:54.730]
He didn't have to lose.

[01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:56.570]
It was a little bit of that and love that is in the sand.

[01:21:56.950 --> 01:21:59.710]
Remember? Come on here. You can do it.

[01:22:00.310 --> 01:22:00.590]
Oh, yeah.

[01:22:03.670 --> 01:22:05.070]
Can he sing or what?

[01:22:05.450 --> 01:22:07.510]
Can he go how to have an house to sound?

[01:22:07.650 --> 01:22:07.790]
Oh.

[01:22:07.790 --> 01:22:08.550]
Oh, man.

[01:22:10.490 --> 01:22:11.170]
Oh, man.

[01:22:12.490 --> 01:22:13.530]
Yeah, this is 40.

[01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:15.430]
Get the long distance.

[01:22:15.730 --> 01:22:16.910]
Don't you have count me in?

[01:22:16.950 --> 01:22:18.010]
You want to have count me in.

[01:22:18.190 --> 01:22:18.290]
Yeah.

[01:22:18.290 --> 01:22:19.410]
You got all these March and March.

[01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:20.090]
But get the long distance.

[01:22:20.170 --> 01:22:21.330]
I just heard it.

[01:22:22.190 --> 01:22:22.510]
There.

[01:22:23.710 --> 01:22:24.410]
Oh, bless you.

[01:22:24.890 --> 01:22:25.750]
Gary, just count me in.

[01:22:25.830 --> 01:22:26.890]
I'm telling you. Count me out.

[01:22:27.330 --> 01:22:28.790]
Anyway, it was one heck of a count me out.

[01:22:29.790 --> 01:22:31.890]
One minute, 58 seconds for that save your heart for me.

[01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:33.050]
Yeah. How about the state?

[01:22:33.150 --> 01:22:33.710]
I'm always waiting.

[01:22:33.890 --> 01:22:35.370]
I think 148 is something like that.

[01:22:35.370 --> 01:22:36.110]
I'm going to get it.

[01:22:36.110 --> 01:22:38.370]
I'm going to get the long distance.

[01:22:39.190 --> 01:22:39.550]
I'm going to get it.

[01:22:39.550 --> 01:22:39.730]
Nice talk.

[01:22:39.770 --> 01:22:40.290]
That's a good song.

[01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:41.590]
That was his best song coming in.

[01:22:41.590 --> 01:22:42.810]
This time, I'm going to bring this big of a hit.

[01:22:43.090 --> 01:22:43.450]
140.

[01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:44.670]
The state or East William.

[01:22:44.890 --> 01:22:45.170]
140.

[01:22:45.730 --> 01:22:46.350]
I told you.

[01:22:46.990 --> 01:22:49.010]
In fact, now I don't have to make sure when it's two.

[01:22:49.170 --> 01:22:50.250]
And songs as well.

[01:22:51.370 --> 01:22:53.250]
How about the recording by Frank Stammel?

[01:22:53.370 --> 01:22:53.870]
I was pretty sure.

[01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.350]
I don't have it.

[01:22:54.390 --> 01:22:54.710]
I have a record.

[01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:56.570]
I did the words that I've been recording for before.

[01:22:56.810 --> 01:22:58.070]
I don't have a record.

[01:22:58.950 --> 01:22:59.530]
Why not?

[01:23:02.690 --> 01:23:03.470]
Okay, that's enough.

[01:23:03.670 --> 01:23:04.690]
The East William is in state.

[01:23:04.690 --> 01:23:06.330]
It's 10 seconds long.

[01:23:06.390 --> 01:23:06.910]
Be hit.

[01:23:07.630 --> 01:23:08.730]
Bon suit on deck.

[01:23:08.870 --> 01:23:10.470]
Oh, Josh is going to be really upset about this.

[01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:12.170]
If you think he's PO about those two brothers,

[01:23:12.190 --> 01:23:13.270]
stick them in the same bed.

[01:23:13.970 --> 01:23:16.790]
If Barry Bonzler asks a judge this morning to seize the profits

[01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:18.630]
from the explosive new book Game of Shadows,

[01:23:19.070 --> 01:23:21.110]
the office attorneys will be waiting on the courthouse steps

[01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:22.690]
to fire back with the lawsuit of their own.

[01:23:22.810 --> 01:23:23.410]
You go, boys.

[01:23:23.810 --> 01:23:24.430]
Kick his ass.

[01:23:25.090 --> 01:23:25.310]
Fony.

[01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:27.170]
He has no right to anyone's profits.

[01:23:27.410 --> 01:23:28.790]
And he has no right to stop information.

[01:23:29.230 --> 01:23:29.790]
Eva Burton.

[01:23:30.170 --> 01:23:31.410]
General Counsel for the Hears Corporation,

[01:23:31.450 --> 01:23:33.550]
which owns the San Francisco Chronicle,

[01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:34.710]
told the Daily News yesterday,

[01:23:35.090 --> 01:23:37.610]
I think these trends of success are close to zero.

[01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:39.290]
In other words, just like that,

[01:23:39.610 --> 01:23:41.710]
just like the numbers of the safety crosses street,

[01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:42.390]
close to zero.

[01:23:42.890 --> 01:23:44.670]
Michael Reigns, Bonz attorney, said yesterday,

[01:23:45.090 --> 01:23:47.110]
he'll seek a temporary restraining order against the Chronicle

[01:23:47.110 --> 01:23:48.170]
and the reporters, Mark,

[01:23:48.670 --> 01:23:49.630]
Fainter-Rue Wata,

[01:23:49.930 --> 01:23:51.410]
and Lance Williams who co-authored the book,

[01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:53.510]
published your Gotham books and Sports Illustrated

[01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:55.810]
which published an excerpt of Shadows two weeks ago.

[01:23:56.430 --> 01:23:58.230]
Notably, the suit Reigns expected to file

[01:23:58.230 --> 01:24:00.910]
in California Superior Court in San Francisco is not for libel.

[01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:02.990]
Rather than challenge the facts in the book,

[01:24:02.990 --> 01:24:05.830]
Bonz lost its expected argue that the writers got their information,

[01:24:05.850 --> 01:24:08.490]
including secret grand jury testimony and investigators notes illegally.

[01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:10.550]
He wants an injunction to stop sales of the book

[01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:11.890]
and sees all profits from it.

[01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:13.370]
So they don't deny anything in the book.

[01:24:13.950 --> 01:24:16.750]
The author is also counter-sue under California's strong anti-slap

[01:24:16.750 --> 01:24:20.110]
at stands for Strategic Laws to Begins Public Participation Statute,

[01:24:20.290 --> 01:24:23.150]
which prevents parties from using the courts to stifle free speech.

[01:24:23.410 --> 01:24:26.870]
Generally, the laws use to keep large corporations from suing critics to silence them,

[01:24:27.210 --> 01:24:27.690]
like Walmart.

[01:24:28.270 --> 01:24:30.090]
Defendants suspect Reigns is simply trying to find

[01:24:30.090 --> 01:24:31.510]
some white-ledist clients' safe face.

[01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:33.070]
He has to be able to say to his buddies,

[01:24:33.390 --> 01:24:35.210]
I sued him in order to resurrect his reputation

[01:24:35.210 --> 01:24:38.030]
said, Lord, for one of the defendants speaking on the Commission of Anonymity.

[01:24:38.250 --> 01:24:40.030]
It's hard to win a libel case when the story is right.

[01:24:40.530 --> 01:24:43.170]
The book's publisher is also offered on conditional support for the authors.

[01:24:43.570 --> 01:24:46.430]
We had Gotham books are shocked that Barry Bonz would take such a

[01:24:46.430 --> 01:24:47.950]
foolish stepcothamist in the statement,

[01:24:48.290 --> 01:24:51.190]
and respected First Amendment lawyer in America knows that his claim is nonsense.

[01:24:51.890 --> 01:24:54.250]
Nonsense! B.S. Barry! God!

[01:24:54.750 --> 01:24:57.490]
Maybe that's what the BB stands for in his name, a BB Brain.

[01:24:58.170 --> 01:25:01.030]
The book released yesterday says that Bonz started taking a hard course steroids

[01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:03.150]
in human growth hormone before the 99 season,

[01:25:03.370 --> 01:25:06.690]
targeting claims that the Anonymity took steroids provided by the Velcro lab.

[01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:07.810]
He was shmurrinid.

[01:25:07.850 --> 01:25:08.890]
Back them all over.

[01:25:09.370 --> 01:25:11.670]
Anna Morshraw, California business and real estate attorney,

[01:25:11.810 --> 01:25:15.830]
who successfully soon under the Slifed Statute said Bonz lost who could easily backfire.

[01:25:16.270 --> 01:25:18.330]
The court's going to look at whether there's truth to the accusations.

[01:25:18.770 --> 01:25:21.690]
Frankly, the guy's opening a real can of worms because he's going to have to testify

[01:25:21.690 --> 01:25:23.410]
if all of these things Morshraw said.

[01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:26.430]
It sounds to me like Bonz is saying, do something, come up with something.

[01:25:26.570 --> 01:25:27.630]
Can't you do something to stop this?

[01:25:28.030 --> 01:25:31.010]
Burton said that Bonz himself was recently partnered with the Chronicle in a style

[01:25:31.010 --> 01:25:35.030]
suit against one of his former physicians, Andrew Carver, who sued Bonz and the paper.

[01:25:35.370 --> 01:25:38.810]
We actually won that case with Bonz and he's about to deposit a check for it, she said.

[01:25:39.290 --> 01:25:44.050]
As for the brewing legal battle, she said, this type of litigation does not strike me as reigning with validity,

[01:25:44.470 --> 01:25:45.250]
meaning Bonz suit.

[01:25:45.550 --> 01:25:48.630]
If range files a lawsuit today that rehearsed attorneys will immediately file theirs

[01:25:48.630 --> 01:25:50.610]
whether Bonz requests a successful or not.

[01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:55.290]
Fender will wait a who appeared on the sports news live yesterday,

[01:25:55.570 --> 01:25:57.070]
said he's not worried about any legal challenges.

[01:25:57.070 --> 01:26:01.010]
We stand fully behind the reporting for the book and our confidence, accuracy and stories,

[01:26:01.110 --> 01:26:02.410]
George Corris, even though he denies it.

[01:26:02.550 --> 01:26:07.610]
He says, very bonz is the greatest baseball player of the league, which we say, yeah, your mama, get out of here.

[01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:09.610]
You had to be joking when you said that, of course.

[01:26:10.030 --> 01:26:11.050]
No, definitely not.

[01:26:11.790 --> 01:26:16.630]
Oh my God, a sack religious man, a punk like you that knows major league baseball,

[01:26:17.050 --> 01:26:23.350]
you wouldn't know Willie Mays from Billy Mays, the guy that sells that smear stuff on TV.

[01:26:23.530 --> 01:26:24.290]
Right, Jessica Beelie.

[01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:27.510]
But what tells Jessica Beelie got to do with Willie Mays?

[01:26:27.550 --> 01:26:28.390]
I'll leave her out of this.

[01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:29.790]
Yeah, she did us it.

[01:26:29.970 --> 01:26:36.410]
What else you got to do with Mickey Mendel and all those other Jewish ball players on Game of Thrones and Hank Greenberg and Hank Goldberg.

[01:26:36.590 --> 01:26:40.090]

And as good as the girl looks like a lady.

[01:27:41.630 --> 01:27:42.230]
It's Jerry!

[01:27:42.610 --> 01:27:46.930]
It's the little woman with a pair of wings and a high.

[01:27:47.090 --> 01:27:49.270]
And as Helen Riddies hit, never sounded better.

[01:27:49.810 --> 01:27:57.070]

[01:28:36.890 --> 01:28:39.090]
You can tell it's K-Tel, we go!

[01:28:39.090 --> 01:28:40.950]
And you wonder why his kids stopped speaking?

[01:28:41.170 --> 01:28:44.390]
A lot of people thought it was from the trauma of seeing his buddies getting blown to bits and Vietnam.

[01:28:44.450 --> 01:28:48.230]
That could have been part of it, but if Jerry Lewis was your daddy, you'd probably like her claim.

[01:28:48.370 --> 01:28:48.750]
I doubt it.

[01:28:49.430 --> 01:28:50.710]
Stay off into space a lot.

[01:28:51.210 --> 01:28:52.110]
1202 at 560.

[01:28:52.290 --> 01:28:53.050]
Here's the follow-up.

[01:28:53.150 --> 01:28:58.550]
Here's the rest of the story on Barbara Bush, Vance, Martha Washington.

[01:28:59.130 --> 01:29:03.350]
As Barbara Bush spent two hours championing her son's software company at a Houston Middle School yesterday morning,

[01:29:03.450 --> 01:29:08.990]
a watchdog who questioned whether the former first lady should be allowed to channel a donation to Neil Bush's Ignite Learning Company.

[01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:11.410]
Houston's hurricane Katrina relief fund.

[01:29:11.550 --> 01:29:14.030]
It's strange that the former first lady would want to do this.

[01:29:14.070 --> 01:29:16.450]
If her son's having a rough time, if it couldn't she write him a check?

[01:29:16.850 --> 01:29:21.110]
Sedaniel Borichoff, founder of the American Institute of Philanthropy, a Chicago-based charity watchdog group,

[01:29:21.450 --> 01:29:23.550]
maybe she isn't aware that people could frown upon this.

[01:29:24.030 --> 01:29:27.990]
Some critics said donations to a tax-deductible charitable fund shouldn't benefit the Bush family.

[01:29:28.390 --> 01:29:31.690]
Others questioned whether the Houston Independent School District violated this street policy

[01:29:31.690 --> 01:29:34.810]
by allowing the company to host a promotional event on the school campus.

[01:29:35.630 --> 01:29:39.830]
HISD officials said the amended Fleming Middle School where Bush met with 40 educators and binoculars

[01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:41.210]
did not violate policy.

[01:29:41.550 --> 01:29:45.030]
The school is among 80-year campuses that received the Ignite curriculum on wheel systems

[01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:49.810]
because of Bush's donation of an underscores amount of the Bush Clinton Houston hurricane relief fund.

[01:29:50.090 --> 01:29:54.370]
She gave specific instructions that part of the money be sent to the Scottish Space School Foundation.

[01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:57.870]
She asked that the group in turn use the money to buy eight Ignite systems

[01:29:57.870 --> 01:30:02.330]
by adding that 3800 bucks each for Harris County Schools with large numbers of hurricane Katrina evacuated

[01:30:02.330 --> 01:30:03.630]
to the Bush and Fund officials.

[01:30:03.990 --> 01:30:07.970]
I said to George one day, maybe it sort of selfish of me, but I'd like to give something I could see to resolve

[01:30:07.970 --> 01:30:08.890]
though she told the crowd.

[01:30:09.330 --> 01:30:10.710]
The thing I knew about was the cow.

[01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.610]
Huh?

[01:30:12.150 --> 01:30:13.070]
Well, she has a mirror.

[01:30:13.490 --> 01:30:13.750]
I say.

[01:30:14.110 --> 01:30:16.970]
She said she hopes the donation will encourage other companies in individuality

[01:30:16.970 --> 01:30:20.150]
give both time and money to public schools strapped by Hurricane Katrina.

[01:30:20.530 --> 01:30:23.170]
Who said her son's company couldn't have afforded the donation on its own.

[01:30:23.510 --> 01:30:24.010]
They gave a lot.

[01:30:24.150 --> 01:30:25.190]
They couldn't give more, she said.

[01:30:25.470 --> 01:30:27.490]
They'd love to give more, but they're a small little company.

[01:30:28.050 --> 01:30:30.370]
Steve Maeslin, president of the Greater Houston Community Foundation,

[01:30:30.370 --> 01:30:36.290]
which is minestringly $979,000 relief fund that Bush donated to said the donation was made legally and properly.

[01:30:36.730 --> 01:30:38.870]
Mrs. Bush wanted to support the local hurricane effort.

[01:30:38.970 --> 01:30:40.410]
He said she could have done directly.

[01:30:40.690 --> 01:30:43.170]
She chose to do it to hear to get the word out about the fund.

[01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:47.050]
Fleming rolled out the red carpet for Bush, color-guided members from Wheatley High School,

[01:30:47.170 --> 01:30:49.190]
and band members from Kashmir, or that Kushmir.

[01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:52.650]
Kushmir and took his high school for form to be Hurricane Katrina evacuated.

[01:30:52.870 --> 01:30:56.010]
We now attend Fleming spoke about why they enjoy using the curriculum on wheels.

[01:30:56.010 --> 01:30:59.170]
It makes me laugh, said, vice and smith and 15-year-old Fleming student.

[01:30:59.290 --> 01:31:00.310]
I really do enjoy the cow.

[01:31:02.830 --> 01:31:08.610]
Well, HISD has a policy that prevents the district from endorphs from endorsing or promoting the merit of a brand name or trademark products.

[01:31:08.910 --> 01:31:10.410]
Houston officials defended the event.

[01:31:11.090 --> 01:31:16.230]
Nancy Lomax, a long-time parodactivist in the HISD, said the district shouldn't have allowed the event to be held during school hours.

[01:31:17.010 --> 01:31:19.030]
HISD, as a matter of policy, does endorse products.

[01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:21.930]
I think they're getting way off course, their own moral course, she said.

[01:31:21.930 --> 01:31:25.730]
I can understand that HISD is in an awkward position where it's sent to get from a powerful person.

[01:31:26.010 --> 01:31:30.390]
But for the same time, turn it around and make it a dog and pony show is disgusting, she said.

[01:31:30.810 --> 01:31:31.750]
Disgusting, and it goes on.

[01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:35.050]
It'll be on our website when Josh gets around.

[01:31:35.210 --> 01:31:35.750]
Stop it and it regalls.

[01:31:36.270 --> 01:31:36.470]
Huh?

[01:31:37.170 --> 01:31:38.510]
What do these things do?

[01:31:38.510 --> 01:31:39.450]
Soon they're through with lunch.

[01:31:40.010 --> 01:31:40.630]
What was the lunch from?

[01:31:41.070 --> 01:31:41.490]
I run this.

[01:31:41.730 --> 01:31:41.830]
Yeah.

[01:31:42.350 --> 01:31:45.770]
Which of these women would you most like to see naked, who you haven't seen naked already?

[01:31:45.770 --> 01:31:47.510]
We got 861 votes.

[01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:49.170]
We'll get to 10,000 easy today.

[01:31:49.450 --> 01:31:52.330]
If we could give 1,000 votes on this, then our whole audience had to be gay.

[01:31:52.970 --> 01:31:58.570]
With so far, how many we got, those kind of 17, 101.9%.

[01:31:58.570 --> 01:32:00.070]
Where the hell are all the gay guys?

[01:32:00.750 --> 01:32:02.750]
So you all as soon as they heard this poll, it scared them away.

[01:32:03.630 --> 01:32:06.010]
Jessica Simpson, 72, Jessica Alba, 69.

[01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:07.390]
Man, that is a cat fight.

[01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:08.550]
They're duking it out.

[01:32:08.610 --> 01:32:09.290]
I'd love to see that.

[01:32:09.710 --> 01:32:12.010]
Barbara and Jenna Bush, president's daughter, 57.

[01:32:12.250 --> 01:32:13.510]
They're respectable, third.

[01:32:13.770 --> 01:32:15.310]
Just like they were the first time we took the poll.

[01:32:15.310 --> 01:32:19.450]
Their competitors have changed on both sides all around, but they're a solid number three.

[01:32:19.610 --> 01:32:20.470]
Is what they are.

[01:32:20.710 --> 01:32:21.350]
Rock solid.

[01:32:21.650 --> 01:32:23.970]
And well, that too.

[01:32:24.610 --> 01:32:25.670]
Jennifer Love Hewitt, 49.

[01:32:25.830 --> 01:32:26.750]
Nice to meet you on a P.

[01:32:27.610 --> 01:32:28.750]
Shakira, 43.

[01:32:29.290 --> 01:32:29.710]

[01:32:30.330 --> 01:32:31.390]
Beyonce, 032.

[01:32:32.170 --> 01:32:34.770]
Anna Corneloyah, 31, who's dropped way down.

[01:32:35.150 --> 01:32:36.250]
Way off that big perch.

[01:32:36.970 --> 01:32:38.050]
Dali Parton, 29.

[01:32:38.510 --> 01:32:39.010]
They're partin.

[01:32:39.230 --> 01:32:40.910]
Hard to find out where, but they're partin.

[01:32:42.270 --> 01:32:43.690]
Kirsten Dunst, 27.

[01:32:44.030 --> 01:32:45.310]
Jennifer Aniston, 24.

[01:32:45.790 --> 01:32:46.830]
Sandra Bullock, 24.

[01:32:47.350 --> 01:32:48.430]
Brittany Spears, 21.

[01:32:48.730 --> 01:32:51.110]
Oh my god, down 110 from that first poll.

[01:32:51.550 --> 01:32:52.990]
She has slid off the face of the globe.

[01:32:53.370 --> 01:32:54.270]
Her globe has faded.

[01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:55.490]
Faith Hill, 20.

[01:32:55.590 --> 01:32:56.410]
Barbara Eden, 20.

[01:32:56.670 --> 01:32:58.370]
Sophia Fugera, 19.

[01:32:58.830 --> 01:32:59.970]
Jessica Biel, 18.

[01:33:00.090 --> 01:33:01.710]
No matter how you spell it, she had much.

[01:33:02.130 --> 01:33:03.230]
Daisy Fuentes, 18.

[01:33:03.430 --> 01:33:04.630]
Sarah Michelle Geller, 18.

[01:33:05.390 --> 01:33:06.410]
Sandra, what's her name?

[01:33:06.810 --> 01:33:07.790]
They all count her, don't have any.

[01:33:07.790 --> 01:33:09.350]
Nikki Cox, 18.

[01:33:10.150 --> 01:33:11.510]
Janine Reno, 20 yet.

[01:33:11.790 --> 01:33:13.810]
And they've been downed she'll aily, or sister Jean.

[01:33:14.210 --> 01:33:15.510]
None of them, I'm gay, 17.

[01:33:16.130 --> 01:33:17.190]
I hate this poll, 16.

[01:33:17.530 --> 01:33:19.110]
None, I'm a heterosexual female, 14.

[01:33:19.230 --> 01:33:19.970]
We got 14 women.

[01:33:20.410 --> 01:33:21.110]
Straight ones anyway.

[01:33:21.430 --> 01:33:23.390]
Mariah Carey, 14, with that one huge booby,

[01:33:23.830 --> 01:33:24.550]
in the middle of her forehead.

[01:33:25.170 --> 01:33:26.290]

Christine Aguilara, 5.

[01:33:39.890 --> 01:33:42.170]
As the J. Michael Wilson used to say, I'm 15 or 13.

[01:33:42.390 --> 01:33:43.970]
Squeak, squeak, Rodney DeRoden.

[01:33:44.410 --> 01:33:45.450]

[01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:54.030]
Four for Duff, they want to see Duff naked.

Lindsay, low hand, 4.

[01:33:56.070 --> 01:33:57.230]
Hillary Duff, Lindsay.

T. Leone, 4.

[01:33:59.110 --> 01:34:00.370]
You think there's something symbolic there?

[01:34:00.670 --> 01:34:01.690]
Maybe the Fox, 4.

[01:34:02.090 --> 01:34:02.830]
I think there's...

[01:34:02.830 --> 01:34:03.990]
What are you going to do about it?

[01:34:04.230 --> 01:34:04.750]
You fairy!

[01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:06.830]
Elizabeth Flarzky, from Survivor 4.

[01:34:06.830 --> 01:34:07.950]

And Bridget Wilson, 1.

[01:34:21.630 --> 01:34:21.910]
Did we...

[01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:23.210]
What we got Hillary Duff's got for?

[01:34:23.790 --> 01:34:26.030]
Rod the Cradle, she's about 7 years old.

[01:34:26.190 --> 01:34:26.470]
She's...

[01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:27.650]
How old are you?

[01:34:27.910 --> 01:34:28.610]
She looks about 7.

[01:34:28.730 --> 01:34:29.350]
She looks...

[01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:29.470]
Huh?

[01:34:29.770 --> 01:34:30.530]
She's known to script.

[01:34:30.970 --> 01:34:31.170]
Yeah.

[01:34:31.250 --> 01:34:32.330]
Just kind of generic looking.

[01:34:32.830 --> 01:34:33.750]
W.A.M., hello.

[01:34:33.970 --> 01:34:34.850]
I think it's one of my checks.

[01:34:34.850 --> 01:34:35.790]
Yeah, okay.

[01:34:36.610 --> 01:34:37.830]
W.A.M., hello.

[01:34:38.530 --> 01:34:38.890]
Hello.

[01:34:39.070 --> 01:34:39.070]

[01:34:39.070 --> 01:34:39.130]
Hello.

[01:34:39.470 --> 01:34:40.150]
Yeah, hi, Neil.

[01:34:40.530 --> 01:34:40.830]
Yes, sir.

[01:34:41.130 --> 01:34:42.630]
Is Jennifer Gardner on that poll?

[01:34:43.030 --> 01:34:43.250]
No.

[01:34:43.610 --> 01:34:44.210]
Well, she should be.

[01:34:44.570 --> 01:34:45.050]
What is it?

[01:34:45.090 --> 01:34:45.370]
She is now.

[01:34:45.650 --> 01:34:46.110]
Okay, thanks.

[01:34:47.070 --> 01:34:48.350]
How about Earl Stanley Gardner?

[01:34:48.670 --> 01:34:48.930]
Gardner.

[01:34:49.330 --> 01:34:50.130]
How about James Gardner?

[01:34:50.730 --> 01:34:51.550]
I never liked him.

[01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:52.530]
What was that show he was on?

[01:34:52.910 --> 01:34:53.410]
Rockford Files.

[01:34:53.790 --> 01:34:54.590]
I never liked him.

[01:34:55.430 --> 01:34:56.150]
Rockford Files.

[01:34:56.630 --> 01:34:57.130]
That is show.

[01:34:57.530 --> 01:34:58.030]
I liked it.

[01:34:58.270 --> 01:34:59.490]
You liked the Rockford Files?

[01:34:59.830 --> 01:35:00.110]
Mm-hmm.

[01:35:00.170 --> 01:35:00.470]
That was funny.

[01:35:00.690 --> 01:35:01.790]
I thought there was a cop show.

[01:35:01.930 --> 01:35:02.770]
You don't like cop shows.

[01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:03.710]
I was a case without it, too.

[01:35:03.710 --> 01:35:05.750]
Oh, no wonder I hated it.

[01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:06.050]
Phony.

[01:35:06.310 --> 01:35:07.410]
Phony Bologna, I did.

[01:35:07.510 --> 01:35:07.710]
It was effective.

[01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:09.010]
Just give him the shaft.

[01:35:09.910 --> 01:35:10.890]
W.A.M., hello.

[01:35:12.030 --> 01:35:13.410]
Hey, I, Neil.

[01:35:13.850 --> 01:35:14.310]
Good team, though.

[01:35:14.430 --> 01:35:14.770]
Yes, sir.

[01:35:15.050 --> 01:35:15.070]
Yes.

[01:35:16.290 --> 01:35:16.970]
Oh, guys.

[01:35:17.190 --> 01:35:17.630]
Like this.

[01:35:18.650 --> 01:35:19.590]
Oh, bye, folks.

[01:35:20.330 --> 01:35:20.810]
Bye, boo.

[01:35:21.110 --> 01:35:21.490]
Bye, boo.

[01:35:21.870 --> 01:35:22.170]
Bye, boo.

[01:35:22.430 --> 01:35:22.710]
Yeah.

[01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.910]
Back action.

[01:35:24.270 --> 01:35:26.130]
If you could have done it to the rhythm, that would have been something.

[01:35:26.470 --> 01:35:26.850]
Yeah, right.

[01:35:27.010 --> 01:35:27.710]
That would have been very good.

[01:35:27.770 --> 01:35:29.310]
We could have liked your package, that and solely.

[01:35:29.510 --> 01:35:30.810]
Time it could have made a promo out of it.

[01:35:30.890 --> 01:35:31.770]
There's a couple of parts on it.

[01:35:32.890 --> 01:35:33.690]
W.A.M., hello.

[01:35:33.690 --> 01:35:33.690]

[01:35:33.690 --> 01:35:33.690]

[01:35:33.690 --> 01:35:33.690]

[01:35:34.310 --> 01:35:35.130]
Neil, how you doing?

[01:35:35.470 --> 01:35:35.710]
Good.

[01:35:36.270 --> 01:35:38.870]
Are you ever talking about doing the opposite of that poll?

[01:35:39.190 --> 01:35:40.350]
Who you never want to see naked?

[01:35:40.930 --> 01:35:41.650]
Yeah, that's brilliant.

[01:35:41.890 --> 01:35:41.890]

[01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:43.310]
Who would you never want to see naked?

[01:35:44.770 --> 01:35:46.490]
We'll just put ourselves out there for starting.

[01:35:46.570 --> 01:35:49.150]
Yeah, just up after phone book, start writing down names.

[01:35:49.530 --> 01:35:50.450]
W.A.M., hello.

[01:35:50.970 --> 01:35:51.230]
Hello.

[01:35:51.650 --> 01:35:52.010]
Yes, sir.

[01:35:52.530 --> 01:35:57.070]
Hey, I'm going to have to beg the differ with you in that caller earlier regarding Jessica B.L.,

[01:35:57.070 --> 01:35:58.770]
she is absolutely hot.

[01:35:59.190 --> 01:36:00.670]
Well, she must photograph poorly.

[01:36:00.770 --> 01:36:01.690]
There are some people like that.

[01:36:01.690 --> 01:36:05.650]
I looked at 80,000 pictures, they were just to try to convince me of what George was saying.

[01:36:05.950 --> 01:36:07.810]
And he also emailed me about 400 more.

[01:36:08.330 --> 01:36:09.150]
And she's okay.

[01:36:09.450 --> 01:36:14.830]
I mean, I'm sure George and Josh have probably seen the remake of Texas came off, Massacre.

[01:36:15.250 --> 01:36:15.250]

[01:36:15.570 --> 01:36:15.810]
Yeah.

[01:36:17.130 --> 01:36:19.250]
And that's the way she looks at Matt.

[01:36:19.470 --> 01:36:23.550]
And also, there must be something in the water and pump and obiach, because I agree with Josh.

[01:36:23.650 --> 01:36:25.530]
I think Barry von's is the greatest player of all time.

[01:36:26.150 --> 01:36:28.950]
Okay, well, Oson, you were batting in thousands, even he can't do that.

[01:36:29.290 --> 01:36:30.210]
Checks on the mail, huh, Josh?

[01:36:30.530 --> 01:36:30.690]
Yeah.

[01:36:30.910 --> 01:36:31.750]
Checks on the mail, sir.

[01:36:32.070 --> 01:36:32.690]
Here, I'll pitch for it.

[01:36:32.890 --> 01:36:33.730]
But hey, he gets it.

[01:36:33.810 --> 01:36:34.490]
That guy gets it.

[01:36:34.690 --> 01:36:36.330]
Yeah, he, I don't think he does get it.

[01:36:36.410 --> 01:36:36.970]
That's a problem.

[01:36:36.990 --> 01:36:37.490]
Oh, he gets it.

[01:36:37.490 --> 01:36:38.170]
Maybe he's going to get it.

[01:36:38.310 --> 01:36:39.970]
Maybe he's going to get it from Barry von's.

[01:36:40.330 --> 01:36:43.990]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 8, maybe he and Barry can shmere a little over that cream together.

[01:36:44.130 --> 01:36:46.250]
I don't want to argue with you, but I don't want to hear about it.

[01:36:46.270 --> 01:36:47.870]
This first day is like, can I hear you think of it?

[01:36:47.950 --> 01:36:48.610]
I'm the face of it.

[01:36:48.650 --> 01:36:51.690]
And it's so ass-in-eye, I'm just saying he's the greatest baseball player of all time.

[01:36:51.690 --> 01:36:54.770]
When you're such a young punk, I mean, it's idiotic.

[01:36:54.810 --> 01:36:57.470]
Okay, do you want me to give you my one reason why he's the greatest player?

[01:36:57.810 --> 01:36:58.590]
Better than 10 Williams.

[01:36:58.610 --> 01:36:59.870]
Better than Stan Musiel.

[01:37:00.010 --> 01:37:00.590]
Better than Ty's.

[01:37:00.770 --> 01:37:01.650]
Better than Hank Green.

[01:37:01.770 --> 01:37:04.030]
Out of the, out of the, like, the Mickey Mantle, Henry Aaron.

[01:37:04.390 --> 01:37:05.490]
All of these great baseball players.

[01:37:05.490 --> 01:37:07.270]
All right, let's, he's the greatest baseball player ever.

[01:37:07.390 --> 01:37:08.570]
It sits in idiotic statement.

[01:37:08.650 --> 01:37:09.510]
Listen to what I'm going to say.

[01:37:09.670 --> 01:37:12.670]
I'll never say another thing is the greatest driver in harness racing history.

[01:37:12.810 --> 01:37:13.070]
Listen to me.

[01:37:13.110 --> 01:37:13.950]
I'll never say another thing.

[01:37:14.490 --> 01:37:18.410]
And of all those guys you just named who are arguably the greatest players, you know, people have their opinions.

[01:37:18.410 --> 01:37:20.430]
There's one who's that, who's worried.

[01:37:20.610 --> 01:37:22.170]
That that sticks out for Barry Barnes.

[01:37:22.270 --> 01:37:22.910]
You ready for it?

[01:37:23.010 --> 01:37:24.210]
Hey, that's your own opinion.

[01:37:24.310 --> 01:37:25.450]
No, no, there's one who's that.

[01:37:25.730 --> 01:37:27.390]
They're like, they're like, they're like, Britney Spears, they're tainted.

[01:37:27.690 --> 01:37:27.990]
You ready?

[01:37:28.510 --> 01:37:28.690]
Yeah.

[01:37:28.970 --> 01:37:29.770]
500 500.

[01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:32.350]
He's hit 500 home runs and 500 stolen bases.

[01:37:32.630 --> 01:37:34.850]
Nobody ever has had 300 300.

[01:37:35.070 --> 01:37:35.290]
No one.

[01:37:35.310 --> 01:37:35.510]
Yeah.

[01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:36.130]
That's it.

[01:37:36.290 --> 01:37:37.810]
Power speed combination and the story.

[01:37:38.050 --> 01:37:39.650]
Yeah, power with the steroids, right?

[01:37:40.330 --> 01:37:43.430]
Okay, Mark McClure is the greatest player in his baseball.

[01:37:43.630 --> 01:37:45.110]
500 500, greatest stat.

[01:37:45.330 --> 01:37:46.410]
How about Jason Jambi?

[01:37:46.410 --> 01:37:49.470]
He ain't hit the greatest steroid player in the North Mark McClure.

[01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:51.210]
You are in sixth denial, man.

[01:37:51.290 --> 01:37:52.150]
You and Sammy Sosa.

[01:37:52.150 --> 01:37:53.470]
There's another phony baloney.

[01:37:53.590 --> 01:37:54.570]
Okay, for you to hear that.

[01:37:54.590 --> 01:37:55.310]
Got the very part.

[01:37:55.970 --> 01:37:56.770]
I love you Chicago.

[01:37:57.370 --> 01:37:57.970]
I love you, Miami.

[01:37:58.230 --> 01:37:58.950]
Whatever that crap.

[01:37:59.490 --> 01:38:00.010]
That baloney.

[01:38:00.650 --> 01:38:02.770]
That's one of the reasons that baseball is such a joke now.

[01:38:02.810 --> 01:38:06.270]
They throw golf balls at the issue of the Haitians are throwing the baseball so tight.

[01:38:06.350 --> 01:38:09.030]
They're like golf balls and they're hitting them like 600 feet.

[01:38:09.450 --> 01:38:12.550]
And when they're all there's steroid, yeah, it's such a crocker crap.

[01:38:12.970 --> 01:38:14.110]
How about Raphael Palmerra?

[01:38:14.110 --> 01:38:16.850]
How come he ain't the best, a greatest liar in history of South Florida?

[01:38:17.330 --> 01:38:17.970]
Next to Greg Reed.

[01:38:18.310 --> 01:38:21.290]
By the way, next time you see Greg George, give me the old Italian sword for me.

[01:38:21.710 --> 01:38:22.110]
What the hell?

[01:38:22.450 --> 01:38:23.730]
I just give him a message.

[01:38:23.910 --> 01:38:25.250]
What are you going to do about it?

[01:38:25.330 --> 01:38:25.830]
You're fair.

[01:38:26.590 --> 01:38:28.470]
This is new, Rodgers.

[01:38:29.610 --> 01:38:32.170]
This is 5.16.28.

[01:38:32.370 --> 01:38:34.490]
I don't care who you are.

[01:38:34.610 --> 01:38:35.850]
You bastard.

[01:38:38.750 --> 01:38:41.130]
You think I'm going to say something to that one.

[01:38:41.510 --> 01:38:43.710]
You think I'm going to wear a coat of gold.

[01:38:43.710 --> 01:38:48.570]
Even when I dress up my clothes don't hide a thing.

[01:38:48.810 --> 01:38:51.050]
Do I give my lips show I go?

[01:38:51.450 --> 01:38:53.790]
Will I try to hide them no one wants?

[01:38:54.230 --> 01:38:58.350]
Even when I dress up my clothes don't hide a thing.

[01:38:58.570 --> 01:39:01.750]
When I walk in tune, it's holding sure I was with you for.

[01:39:02.150 --> 01:39:04.210]
Soaking like a horn, maybe there's a chest.

[01:39:04.710 --> 01:39:07.810]
Cut down the path, so when people say that my head take a team I cry.

[01:39:08.150 --> 01:39:10.350]
I put on a shirt, it will see through.

[01:39:10.670 --> 01:39:12.790]
You can see my roots and blow my nipple soon.

[01:39:12.790 --> 01:39:15.290]
Then I got a shirt and a capy zone.

[01:39:15.530 --> 01:39:17.830]
You can't matter because my mother's a gift.

[01:39:18.210 --> 01:39:20.610]
You think I'm going to dress up too, that won't.

[01:39:20.730 --> 01:39:22.950]
You think I'm going to wear a coat of gold.

[01:39:23.490 --> 01:39:27.710]
Even when I dress up my clothes don't hide a thing.

[01:39:28.090 --> 01:39:30.270]
Do I give my lips show I go?

[01:39:30.710 --> 01:39:32.930]
Will I try to hide them no one wants?

[01:39:33.450 --> 01:39:37.550]
Even when I dress up my clothes don't hide a thing.

[01:39:37.890 --> 01:39:40.330]
Now let's not put her on here because they don't want just all I asked.

[01:39:40.330 --> 01:39:43.690]
9001 votes on a poll will make that thousand like sliding off a cliff.

[01:39:44.050 --> 01:39:47.150]
Speaking of that, Earth's warming likely irreversible scientists say,

[01:39:47.430 --> 01:39:48.110]
wait till you hear this.

[01:39:48.370 --> 01:39:48.810]
Oh boy.

[01:39:49.190 --> 01:39:52.130]
Especially for a South Florida and Nalines.

[01:39:52.630 --> 01:39:55.170]
Within the next hundred years the growing human influence on Earth's climate

[01:39:55.170 --> 01:39:58.650]
could lead to a long and irreversible rise in sea levels by eroding Earth's

[01:39:58.650 --> 01:40:02.750]
bath polar ice sheets according to new observations and analization by several teams of scientists.

[01:40:03.230 --> 01:40:07.550]
One team using computer models of climate and ice found that by about the year 2100.

[01:40:07.550 --> 01:40:10.050]
Oh we won't even be like a memory by that time.

[01:40:10.490 --> 01:40:10.930]
2100.

[01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:15.410]
Average temperatures could be four degrees warmer than the day and that the over come over the coming centuries

[01:40:15.410 --> 01:40:18.270]
the world's oceans could rise 13 to 20 feet.

[01:40:18.690 --> 01:40:21.110]
If you want to go to Amsterdam I think you better plan it pretty soon.

[01:40:21.370 --> 01:40:25.070]
Conditions last seen 130 thousand years ago between the last two ice ages.

[01:40:25.670 --> 01:40:29.670]
The findings reported today in the journal Science are consistent with other recent studies

[01:40:29.670 --> 01:40:31.050]
of melting into erosion at the polls.

[01:40:31.610 --> 01:40:32.370]
The polls are melting.

[01:40:32.970 --> 01:40:34.530]
Probably we're in them bowling socks too tight.

[01:40:34.530 --> 01:40:37.690]
Many experts say there are still uncertainties about timing or stint and causes.

[01:40:38.210 --> 01:40:42.170]
But Jonathan Overpeck of the University of Arizona lead author of one of the studies said

[01:40:42.170 --> 01:40:46.250]
the new findings made a strong case for the danger of painting the curb emissions of carbon dioxide

[01:40:46.250 --> 01:40:47.950]
other heat trapping greenhouse gases.

[01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:50.430]
Yeah, greenhouse gases is Tommy would say.

[01:40:51.670 --> 01:40:55.190]
If we don't like the idea of flooding out in the world in major portions of South Florida

[01:40:55.630 --> 01:40:59.710]
and many other valued parts of the coastal US, we'll have to commit soon to my major effort

[01:40:59.710 --> 01:41:02.070]
to stop most emissions of carbon to the atmosphere he be saying.

[01:41:02.070 --> 01:41:06.610]
According to computer simulation, the global nature of the warming from greenhouse gases,

[01:41:06.910 --> 01:41:09.930]
which diffused around the atmosphere could amplify the melting around Antarctica

[01:41:09.930 --> 01:41:14.670]
beyond that at the last warm period which was driven mainly by extra sunlight reaching the northern hemisphere.

[01:41:15.230 --> 01:41:19.030]
Research has also said it stains from dark soot drifting from power plants and vehicles

[01:41:19.030 --> 01:41:22.710]
could hasten melting in the Arctic by increasing the amount of solar energy absorbed by ice.

[01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:27.070]
The future rise in sea levels driven by loss of ice from both Greenland and West Antarctica

[01:41:27.650 --> 01:41:30.070]
would occur over many centuries and be largely irreversible

[01:41:30.190 --> 01:41:34.210]
but could be delayed by curving emissions of the greenhouse gases that overpecked

[01:41:34.210 --> 01:41:38.550]
and his fellow lead author Betty Otto Blaisner of the National Assembly for Amnesthurek Research

[01:41:38.550 --> 01:41:39.670]
in Boulder, Colorado.

[01:41:40.030 --> 01:41:44.410]
In a second article in Science Research, you'll say they've detected a rising frequency of earthquake

[01:41:44.410 --> 01:41:46.370]
like rumblings in the bedrock.

[01:41:46.830 --> 01:41:48.530]
O'Barnay Rumble is down there making noise.

[01:41:48.730 --> 01:41:49.610]
Maybe he's got the gas.

[01:41:50.350 --> 01:41:54.370]
Rumblings in the bedrock beneath Greenland's two-mile thick ice cap and laid summer since 1993

[01:41:54.370 --> 01:41:59.570]
they had no obvious explanation other than the rough movements of the overlying ice caused by surface melting.

[01:42:00.110 --> 01:42:04.350]
The jostling of the giant ice cloak island is five times more frequent in the summer than in the winter

[01:42:04.350 --> 01:42:07.970]
and is rarely intensified since 2002 since Bush came in.

[01:42:08.370 --> 01:42:13.290]
The data meshed with recent satellite readings showing that the ice can lurch toward the sea during the melting season.

[01:42:13.570 --> 01:42:14.550]
It's lurching over here.

[01:42:14.770 --> 01:42:15.330]
Ever see lurch?

[01:42:15.610 --> 01:42:15.870]
Yes.

[01:42:16.210 --> 01:42:17.790]
I think it ran for President last time.

[01:42:18.310 --> 01:42:23.010]
The analysis was led by Goran Ekstrom of Harvard and Meredith Nettles of the Lamont-Dorothy Earth-Earth-Earth Observatory

[01:42:23.010 --> 01:42:25.130]
in Palisades, New York, part of Columbia University.

[01:42:25.250 --> 01:42:27.950]
You ought to be playing Palisades far by Freddie Boom-Mohm Cannon.

[01:42:29.270 --> 01:42:29.750]
Tunea?

[01:42:29.970 --> 01:42:30.450]
Yes.

[01:42:30.930 --> 01:42:31.270]
At the top.

[01:42:31.690 --> 01:42:33.070]
It will slow there on the uptake.

[01:42:33.070 --> 01:42:35.450]
I was thinking it's a really tight toe tap.

[01:42:40.050 --> 01:42:40.950]
There it is indeed.

[01:42:41.870 --> 01:42:46.770]
In Antarctica and Greenland appears that warming waters are also working ultimately protruding tongues of ice

[01:42:46.770 --> 01:42:50.130]
where glaciers flow into the sea or that's what Taylor Clinton has.

[01:42:50.570 --> 01:42:56.010]
So a bubble said, tongue of ice, where glaciers flow into the sea or intruding beneath ice sheets like those in western Antarctica

[01:42:56.010 --> 01:42:57.330]
that lie mostly below sea level.

[01:42:57.610 --> 01:43:00.390]
Both processes can cause the ice to flow more readily in the audio-ideas.

[01:43:00.490 --> 01:43:01.310]
Well, we'll be dead.

[01:43:01.990 --> 01:43:03.290]
That's one of the good things about it.

[01:43:03.470 --> 01:43:04.770]
We don't have to worry about such crap.

[01:43:05.350 --> 01:43:11.930]
Then they had this shira from this Chattanooga on there on CNN this morning and the bitch bubblehead hostess.

[01:43:11.930 --> 01:43:12.930]
I don't know which one it was.

[01:43:13.250 --> 01:43:17.910]
The one that's on between solely dead and the cure of Phillips, the anxious one.

[01:43:18.410 --> 01:43:20.490]
And it wasn't Mrs. Limbaugh with some other binbaugh.

[01:43:20.790 --> 01:43:22.750]
And she's like, given him what for a...

[01:43:22.750 --> 01:43:23.930]
Don't you think that's unacceptable?

[01:43:23.930 --> 01:43:27.990]
Thousands of calls to Chattanooga's 911 call center have been going unanswered.

[01:43:28.150 --> 01:43:29.930]
According to records... I'm sorry, 9-1-1.

[01:43:30.010 --> 01:43:30.750]
You better not say 9-1-1.

[01:43:31.350 --> 01:43:37.970]
According to records examined after a caller was unable to report a kitchen fire because three or four dispatchers were taking breaks at the same time.

[01:43:38.470 --> 01:43:43.730]
Stacey Hunter and her family members called 9-1-1 from her home phone and cellular phones Monday afternoon when the fire broke up.

[01:43:44.050 --> 01:43:45.130]
But the calls went unanswered.

[01:43:45.210 --> 01:43:52.510]
Finally, our terious bonds and 14-year-old nephew, Quay-Shawan Fountain, I mean, come on with these names.

[01:43:53.150 --> 01:43:59.470]
QU-AY-SH-A-U-N-E, Quay-Shawan Fountain ended up running a half mile to get help from the fire station. No one was hurt.

[01:43:59.750 --> 01:44:01.110]
It was an accident, but nobody got hurt.

[01:44:01.650 --> 01:44:04.750]
If they hadn't gone running my house with a completely burnt-up hunter, 34-set.

[01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:06.210]
And she stood near a scorched kitchen.

[01:44:06.710 --> 01:44:07.550]
That's our terious.

[01:44:07.950 --> 01:44:08.890]
Wait a minute. What's her name?

[01:44:09.430 --> 01:44:10.250]
Quay-Shawan Fountain.

[01:44:10.250 --> 01:44:10.790]
Quay-Shawan Fountain.

[01:44:10.850 --> 01:44:10.970]
Oh.

[01:44:11.310 --> 01:44:18.550]
Chattanooga police chief Steve Parks who oversees employees of the Hamilton County Emergency Communications District said the department was responsible for unanswered calls.

[01:44:18.810 --> 01:44:20.030]
How about Madeline Albright naked?

[01:44:20.030 --> 01:44:26.670]
One dispatcher was taking calls and three others were working with Shifra taking a break to the chief, saying he described the situation as unacceptable of a failure.

[01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:29.530]
It was totally unacceptable of the 911 system.

[01:44:30.050 --> 01:44:32.030]
But records indicate the problem is more widespread.

[01:44:32.370 --> 01:44:33.130]
This is the part...

[01:44:33.130 --> 01:44:38.090]
See, she had a good point this brother on CNN, but since when is the newsreader, anchor, whatever she is?

[01:44:38.330 --> 01:44:44.130]
What is she supposed to be like making editorial comments and chastising the guests and ripping them an ass even though it was deservedly so?

[01:44:44.830 --> 01:44:45.630]
Totally inappropriate.

[01:44:46.090 --> 01:44:46.370]
Bitch.

[01:44:46.370 --> 01:44:53.450]
See, this is the problem because these people are on CNN, therefore they think it gives them some kind of entitlement to open up a big stupid mouth.

[01:44:54.170 --> 01:45:03.370]
During one ten month period from January to October of last year, about 27,000 calls to city dispatchers in Chattanooga at the 911 center went unanswered.

[01:45:04.270 --> 01:45:08.150]
Police spokesman Tetsl Tullary said, oh god, they're going to be making these names up.

[01:45:08.490 --> 01:45:09.350]
Tetsl's Tullary.

[01:45:09.530 --> 01:45:11.250]
Hey, Tets. You sure got nice Tets.

[01:45:11.730 --> 01:45:14.170]
Last month, 20% about... and that's a guy, I think.

[01:45:14.550 --> 01:45:18.630]
Last month, 20% about 2,000 more of the 10,650 calls placed were not answered.

[01:45:18.830 --> 01:45:22.230]
He said, officials said the count includes numerous call or hang-ups and repeat calls.

[01:45:22.750 --> 01:45:23.890]
Right, that's very excuse.

[01:45:24.590 --> 01:45:30.330]
On Monday alone, records show that were 22 unanswered calls to the 911 service in the 27-minute period when the fire was burning.

[01:45:30.710 --> 01:45:31.910]
Six of them came from...

[01:45:32.850 --> 01:45:34.910]
...arturious and Quayshawn's house.

[01:45:35.610 --> 01:45:38.130]
You got four people supposed to be dispatching and three people on break.

[01:45:38.130 --> 01:45:40.190]
I still can't digest that, honor said.

[01:45:40.530 --> 01:45:41.910]
I mean, that's why we heard those sounds before.

[01:45:42.310 --> 01:45:43.370]
Bad indigestion.

[01:45:43.970 --> 01:45:45.250]
That's right. Bad gas.

[01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:47.590]
Is there a good gas?

[01:45:48.090 --> 01:45:48.710]
Here's the facts.

[01:45:49.370 --> 01:45:53.770]
Although I disagree with a lot of knowledgeable baseball people say very bothersome is the greatest hitter of not terrible time.

[01:45:54.110 --> 01:45:59.210]
One I can take of immediately is Ed Kaplan, who's easily the most baseball knowledgeable person on the year, TV or radio in this market.

[01:45:59.470 --> 01:46:01.330]
He's full of crap. I like any of the allowedies full of crap.

[01:46:01.690 --> 01:46:05.310]
He's pretty emphatic about it. In fact, no doubt in his mind. Well, guess what, your mama.

[01:46:05.850 --> 01:46:12.050]
Personally, as an overall player, I take Willie Mays, Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth, also an unbelievable picture before he's made the player reded out as correct.

[01:46:12.510 --> 01:46:16.050]
Or even Ted Williams and Roberto Clemente, but a lot of people know their baseball disagree.

[01:46:16.290 --> 01:46:18.990]
I don't care. It's idiotic on the face of it.

[01:46:19.530 --> 01:46:20.610]
Very bonds my ass.

[01:46:21.050 --> 01:46:22.430]
Especially as Luke's got this...

[01:46:22.430 --> 01:46:25.930]
He's got this taint that covers everything that he's accomplished.

[01:46:26.230 --> 01:46:26.590]
Is that right?

[01:46:27.150 --> 01:46:28.930]
He's considering the always hit home runs.

[01:46:29.330 --> 01:46:29.810]
We have legit.

[01:46:30.110 --> 01:46:30.590]
Ten litres, man.

[01:46:31.290 --> 01:46:32.410]
Did you read that book yet?

[01:46:32.650 --> 01:46:33.370]
Whatever makes it happy.

[01:46:33.370 --> 01:46:36.950]
Have you read the book yet? That's not answered the question. Have you read the book yet? No.

[01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:38.810]
You're going to read it? You're going to get it? No.

[01:46:39.270 --> 01:46:40.330]
I just like with the p-

[01:46:40.330 --> 01:46:43.690]
Well, why not? You know why you can't handle it, truth. That's what Tommy Cruz said.

[01:46:43.770 --> 01:46:44.410]
Not fair, yeah.

[01:46:44.510 --> 01:46:46.110]
You think I don't know he took steroids?

[01:46:46.530 --> 01:46:47.390]
No, that's not the point.

[01:46:47.590 --> 01:46:48.910]
He was just taking steroids.

[01:46:49.350 --> 01:46:51.450]
He was taking all kinds of performance enhancing crap.

[01:46:51.730 --> 01:46:54.870]
Everything you can get his hands on to cheat. He's a cheater. Cheater.

[01:46:55.470 --> 01:47:00.330]
Baby Ruth in the meantime, when other good students walk out L.A. school to protest immigration policies, you broke kids.

[01:47:00.890 --> 01:47:01.890]
Right back to Mexico.

[01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:07.290]
They're having the non-Latino on March in California today.

[01:47:07.670 --> 01:47:09.990]
Or that is that to begin next week.

[01:47:10.290 --> 01:47:12.650]
Oh my god. He sounds like a real screamer, don't I?

[01:47:12.730 --> 01:47:14.450]
Yeah. Wow. Who's that? That's that Tony.

[01:47:14.570 --> 01:47:14.970]
Whatever's that?

[01:47:15.110 --> 01:47:16.170]
How many in part California?

[01:47:16.690 --> 01:47:20.090]
All these brown kids and black kids and blue kids, black and blue.

[01:47:20.530 --> 01:47:21.510]
Now see any white kids, Mark.

[01:47:21.610 --> 01:47:22.430]
And you look at that.

[01:47:22.690 --> 01:47:23.690]
Oh, they're looking at it.

[01:47:23.850 --> 01:47:27.430]
By the way, just to say something, a Latin person,

[01:47:27.430 --> 01:47:31.490]
all the illegal should be beaten over the head with ax handles all the way back to the border

[01:47:31.490 --> 01:47:34.410]
as for some of us who came over here legally.

[01:47:34.670 --> 01:47:37.230]
And what does this have to do with illegal aliens?

[01:47:37.610 --> 01:47:38.990]
In the word, they should name it what it is.

[01:47:39.270 --> 01:47:40.710]
A day without illegals.

[01:47:41.090 --> 01:47:42.650]
That's what happens before they try to make.

[01:47:43.050 --> 01:47:44.130]
That's the question, do they float?

[01:47:44.490 --> 01:47:45.490]
Let's see. Let's find out.

[01:47:45.570 --> 01:47:48.110]
I guess I had on years ago in INC. Do they sink or do they float?

[01:47:48.410 --> 01:47:49.550]
They throw them in the gulps and they say,

[01:47:49.730 --> 01:47:50.610]
The new Roger.

[01:47:51.850 --> 01:47:54.610]
This is 5.62.8.

[01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:58.490]
For watch, boobs and butts and boinking.

[01:47:58.610 --> 01:47:59.010]
Oh, right.

[01:47:59.130 --> 01:48:00.010]
You're up fire!

[01:48:01.150 --> 01:48:02.770]
You can't break me together again.

[01:48:03.350 --> 01:48:04.750]
You're up limits to my shapely revenge.

[01:48:05.550 --> 01:48:07.170]
And that said the record vision by choice.

[01:48:07.490 --> 01:48:09.470]
Today was of course a big round of points.

[01:48:09.950 --> 01:48:12.770]
Oh my God, the dougies and the putters stuck in the dougies.

[01:48:13.070 --> 01:48:14.610]
The more toy out of you when you're on a move.

[01:48:14.990 --> 01:48:15.830]
Do it on a dougies.

[01:48:16.270 --> 01:48:17.630]
Do it on a dougies.

[01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:19.390]
Do it on a dougies.

[01:48:19.770 --> 01:48:20.030]
Do it on a dougies.

[01:48:20.030 --> 01:48:21.270]
Do it on a dougies.

[01:48:21.490 --> 01:48:23.110]
Do it on a dougies.

[01:48:23.630 --> 01:48:24.790]
Do it on a dougies.

[01:48:25.090 --> 01:48:27.050]
Do it on a dougies.

[01:48:27.050 --> 01:48:28.470]
Do it on a dougies.

[01:48:28.650 --> 01:48:32.210]
Up and down inside and off you better get your mitts off the merchandise now.

[01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:33.070]
You're in on a pool.

[01:48:33.270 --> 01:48:34.050]
You think there's no pool.

[01:48:34.210 --> 01:48:36.010]
Take off and take a pair of driving e.s.

[01:48:36.070 --> 01:48:37.470]
Do it on a dougies.

[01:48:39.690 --> 01:48:40.990]
Do it on a dougies.

[01:48:41.510 --> 01:48:43.690]
Do it on a dougies.

[01:48:43.690 --> 01:48:44.670]
Do it on a dougies.

[01:48:45.090 --> 01:48:47.290]
Do it on a dougies.

[01:48:47.290 --> 01:48:48.190]
Do it on a dougies.

[01:48:48.550 --> 01:48:50.030]
Do it on a dougies.

[01:48:50.030 --> 01:48:51.050]
I got nothing to lose.

[01:48:51.190 --> 01:48:52.370]
My virginity lost her.

[01:48:52.450 --> 01:48:53.710]
Give me back my baggy blue shorts.

[01:48:53.710 --> 01:48:54.410]
Why you?

[01:48:54.550 --> 01:48:55.790]
I'll show you who's the boss.

[01:48:55.970 --> 01:48:57.970]
Let's get back to the same tiniest moments.

[01:48:58.250 --> 01:49:02.610]
Do it on a dougies.

[01:49:03.290 --> 01:49:04.790]
Do it on a dougies.

[01:49:05.070 --> 01:49:06.310]
Do it on a dougies.

[01:49:06.530 --> 01:49:08.190]
Do it on a dougies.

[01:49:08.490 --> 01:49:11.290]
Do it on a dougies.

[01:49:12.550 --> 01:49:13.730]
Do it on a dougies.

[01:49:14.150 --> 01:49:17.170]
Do it on a dougies.

[01:49:17.810 --> 01:49:21.870]
Do it on a dougies.

[01:49:21.870 --> 01:49:23.030]
Do it on a dougies.

[01:49:23.110 --> 01:49:24.530]
Do it on a dougies.

[01:49:24.790 --> 01:49:25.310]
Do it on a dougies.

[01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:28.410]
Do it on a dougies.

[01:49:28.410 --> 01:49:29.790]
Do it on a dougies.

[01:49:29.790 --> 01:49:30.830]
Do it on a dougies.

[01:49:30.830 --> 01:49:32.270]
Do it on a dougies.

[01:49:32.290 --> 01:49:35.170]
Oh, 27 to 1.

[01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:36.490]
Speaking of Gelly, he'll be on.

[01:49:37.330 --> 01:49:39.430]
A wine and a pukin from the infest center,

[01:49:39.430 --> 01:49:40.250]
two to four to seven.

[01:49:40.390 --> 01:49:41.530]
A revolving slot.

[01:49:41.910 --> 01:49:43.030]
Let me see a revolving slot.

[01:49:43.290 --> 01:49:43.790]
No comment.

[01:49:43.790 --> 01:49:44.310]
OK.

[01:49:44.710 --> 01:49:45.950]
And then we got a notice for the mad dog,

[01:49:46.110 --> 01:49:47.350]
four to seven also at the end of the center.

[01:49:47.490 --> 01:49:49.610]
And that's all leaning up to the big Panther Ranger game,

[01:49:49.730 --> 01:49:51.870]
Panther Preview with seven, with Jesse Agler,

[01:49:52.490 --> 01:49:53.310]
and Horatio Alger,

[01:49:53.710 --> 01:49:57.270]
and the Panthers of Rangers 730, followed by Tom Jicca for 80K.

[01:49:57.710 --> 01:49:58.550]
The great Tom Jicca.

[01:49:58.670 --> 01:49:59.330]
Oh, God.

[01:49:59.790 --> 01:50:00.770]
What a quizzling.

[01:50:01.510 --> 01:50:04.270]
Already this devote in 2008 on banning same-sex marriages.

[01:50:04.710 --> 01:50:05.610]
Aren't you excited about that?

[01:50:05.890 --> 01:50:06.050]
Florida.

[01:50:06.050 --> 01:50:07.830]
Florida funds did an emotional civil rights battle,

[01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:12.330]
yes, they've in the Florida Supreme Court agreed to allow a state constitutional ban on same-sex marriage

[01:50:12.330 --> 01:50:13.910]
to go on the 2008 ballot.

[01:50:14.090 --> 01:50:14.970]
You know why that's bad news?

[01:50:15.270 --> 01:50:15.490]
Why?

[01:50:15.850 --> 01:50:17.130]
Because that's going to bring out in 2008,

[01:50:17.130 --> 01:50:18.390]
which is the presidential election.

[01:50:18.390 --> 01:50:18.410]
Oh, right.

[01:50:18.710 --> 01:50:20.470]
All the right wing of the social conservatives

[01:50:20.470 --> 01:50:22.970]
and far-bison right wingers will come out to vote.

[01:50:23.330 --> 01:50:23.830]
See that?

[01:50:24.130 --> 01:50:24.630]
I say it.

[01:50:24.850 --> 01:50:25.050]
You're right.

[01:50:25.230 --> 01:50:27.870]
Backers must still collect tens of thousands more signatures to get on the ballot,

[01:50:27.910 --> 01:50:28.370]
but they will.

[01:50:28.530 --> 01:50:32.170]
They insist that with two years to collect the petitions of state Supreme Court clearance out of the way,

[01:50:32.470 --> 01:50:35.210]
the ban on gay weddings will have little trouble going to voters in 2008.

[01:50:35.670 --> 01:50:38.530]
Sponsors and some political experts believe that the ensuing debate of a weather,

[01:50:38.530 --> 01:50:43.230]
gays and lesbians can legally win and Florida may turn out large numbers of social conservative

[01:50:43.230 --> 01:50:45.450]
and Republicans far-bisoned to vote on the same ballot,

[01:50:45.770 --> 01:50:48.110]
in which they'll decide a crucial presidential election.

[01:50:48.530 --> 01:50:51.270]
We've seen in every state with a marriage amendment like this on the ballot

[01:50:51.270 --> 01:50:54.250]
that the people get it and understand the threat and it motivates them to come out and vote.

[01:50:54.590 --> 01:50:59.230]
Senator Landau attorney John Stemberger, chairman of the Florida for Marriage.org group seeking the gay marriage rate,

[01:50:59.410 --> 01:51:00.210]
they see the threat.

[01:51:00.590 --> 01:51:01.930]
Oh, yeah, and it motivates them to come out.

[01:51:02.110 --> 01:51:03.430]
Oh, it's their bigotry and intolerance.

[01:51:03.570 --> 01:51:04.970]
It's stupidity that motivates them to come out.

[01:51:05.210 --> 01:51:05.430]
John.

[01:51:05.430 --> 01:51:08.910]
Voters pass same-sex marriage bans in 12 states in 2004.

[01:51:09.290 --> 01:51:12.850]
Some political analysts say the initiative sucked us by voter turnout among religious conservatives

[01:51:12.850 --> 01:51:15.850]
and helped President Bush win battlegrounds states as Ohio,

[01:51:16.270 --> 01:51:20.130]
although I think the dibolled machines had a bigger role in helping.

[01:51:20.650 --> 01:51:21.170]
A big helping.

[01:51:21.590 --> 01:51:25.670]
The Republican Party of Florida has put at least 200 grand this year toward the Florida for Marriage campaign.

[01:51:26.210 --> 01:51:30.210]
Bakers had hoped to get the issue in the 2006 battle when voters will pick a governor and their nose

[01:51:30.210 --> 01:51:33.890]
and their, but fell short of the necessary signatures when they should take a backseat

[01:51:33.890 --> 01:51:35.290]
to the Terry Shivoh battle.

[01:51:35.430 --> 01:51:35.790]
Shoo!

[01:51:36.110 --> 01:51:40.030]
Over the end of life decisions that Hurricane Relief efforts had built Stevens, executive director

[01:51:40.030 --> 01:51:43.390]
of the Far Bison Christian Coalition of Florida, the Christian Coalition.

[01:51:43.850 --> 01:51:47.470]
Florida is among more than 40 states with existing legislation borrowing same-sex marriage,

[01:51:47.850 --> 01:51:49.390]
the proposed amendment defines marriage reality.

[01:51:50.130 --> 01:51:53.950]
Oh, the proposed amendment says, um, marriage of one man and one woman,

[01:51:54.150 --> 01:51:59.070]
but it also submits the provision in the state constitution and bars legal recognition of anything treated as married

[01:51:59.070 --> 01:52:00.890]
or the substantial equivalent thereof.

[01:52:00.890 --> 01:52:05.330]
Attorneys for the ACL do and others of argue that the proposed language could threaten domestic partner benefits,

[01:52:05.330 --> 01:52:07.170]
already allowed in Florida for gay couples.

[01:52:07.730 --> 01:52:10.330]
And the Christian Coalition says, government-draered.

[01:52:10.690 --> 01:52:12.850]
That's what they said in the Taiwanese.

[01:52:13.190 --> 01:52:14.370]
I said, for Taiwan on.

[01:52:14.610 --> 01:52:15.110]
How does that sound?

[01:52:15.470 --> 01:52:19.330]
Meanwhile, this is kind of flies in the face of the public because public acceptance of almost sexuality

[01:52:19.330 --> 01:52:21.270]
according to the Pew Research Center is a polling.

[01:52:22.250 --> 01:52:25.470]
Public acceptance of almost sexuality has increased in a number of ways and recent years,

[01:52:25.470 --> 01:52:27.450]
that will remain a deeply divisive issue.

[01:52:27.770 --> 01:52:30.590]
Half of Americans, 51% continue to oppose legalized gay marriage,

[01:52:30.930 --> 01:52:34.330]
but this is number to decline significantly from 63% in February 2004,

[01:52:34.750 --> 01:52:40.470]
when opposition spiked following the Massachusetts Supreme Court decision and remained high throughout the 2004 election season.

[01:52:40.970 --> 01:52:44.790]
Opposition to gay marriage has fallen across the board with substantial declines, even among Republicans.

[01:52:45.310 --> 01:52:50.370]
Wow, these are among the results of the latest national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People in the Press

[01:52:50.370 --> 01:52:52.470]
to conducted March 8th to 12th.

[01:52:52.470 --> 01:52:55.570]
The poll also finds less opposition to gay serving openly in the military,

[01:52:55.890 --> 01:52:57.670]
and a greater public willingness to allow gay students to adopt.

[01:52:58.230 --> 01:53:00.490]
Pretty soon, they might even let the gay's breed the first year.

[01:53:00.890 --> 01:53:03.090]
Now that we let a few blacks do it, not too many of them.

[01:53:03.370 --> 01:53:08.470]
A 60% majority now favors allowing gay students to serve openly in the military up from 52% to 94%,

[01:53:09.110 --> 01:53:12.770]
and 46% support gay adoption up from just 38% in 1999.

[01:53:13.710 --> 01:53:17.350]
Despite the fact that gay marriage initiatives are on the ballot in seven states this year,

[01:53:17.450 --> 01:53:19.870]
including Florida, while London was trying to get offered 2008,

[01:53:19.870 --> 01:53:25.270]
the atmosphere surrounding the issue of gay marriage is cooled off, and public intensity is dissipated compared with two years ago.

[01:53:25.690 --> 01:53:29.810]
Strong opposition to gay marriage, which surged in 2004, has ebbed to a new low.

[01:53:30.310 --> 01:53:33.870]
This is especially the case among seniors, Catholics, and not evangelical Protestants.

[01:53:34.870 --> 01:53:41.790]
Among people aged 65 and over, for example, strong opposition to gay marriage jumped from 36% in 2003 to 58% in 2004,

[01:53:42.190 --> 01:53:49.410]
but has fallen to 33% today. It fell back. White evangelical Protestants are the only major group in which a majority still strongly opposes gay marriage,

[01:53:49.410 --> 01:53:52.550]
but even here the intensity of feeling is receded somewhat.

[01:53:53.270 --> 01:53:55.590]
Therefore, bisonism has retreated just to a wee bit.

[01:53:55.930 --> 01:53:56.370]
Another exciting?

[01:53:56.790 --> 01:53:58.170]
A really religious nut cases?

[01:53:58.530 --> 01:53:58.710]
Yeah.

[01:53:58.790 --> 01:54:03.930]
Oh my God. Isn't that what the world is fighting in the Ethi American media and the Democratic Party don't have the balls to come on and say it?

[01:54:04.090 --> 01:54:04.250]
Right.

[01:54:04.350 --> 01:54:06.470]
Fighting religious crazy people. That's what it's all about.

[01:54:07.210 --> 01:54:10.430]
Even if you believe they're a version of 9-11, I'm all this al-Qaeda crap.

[01:54:10.550 --> 01:54:13.370]
Even if you take every word at face value, that's what we're fighting.

[01:54:13.630 --> 01:54:13.870]
Mm-hmm.

[01:54:14.250 --> 01:54:18.030]
But only them, only the ragheads, not our religious fanatics. Oh no, they're good.

[01:54:18.030 --> 01:54:24.310]
Our religious fanaticism is excellent. There is the evil. That's bad. They're the evil dourish, which I thought was something to drink.

[01:54:24.730 --> 01:54:24.930]
Mm-hmm.

[01:54:25.150 --> 01:54:32.330]
The senior Muslim clerics in Kabul, Afghanistan are demanding that that Afghan men on trail for converting from Islam to Christianity be executed.

[01:54:32.630 --> 01:54:33.450]
Wait till you hear this.

[01:54:33.670 --> 01:54:33.930]
Mm-hmm.

[01:54:34.070 --> 01:54:38.530]
Warning that if the government comes into which impression and frees him, they will inside people to pull him into pieces.

[01:54:39.030 --> 01:54:46.390]
These are the civilized people that were working very feversly that were sacrificing our young people to defend in Iraq and Afghanistan.

[01:54:46.390 --> 01:54:54.830]
Aren't you savages? In an unusual move, Condor Leezer telephoned President Karzai yesterday seeking a favorable resolution on the case of Abdul Rafman.

[01:54:55.330 --> 01:54:59.490]
The president has taken a personal interest, just like Mr. Jensen took a personal interest in Howard Beal.

[01:54:59.690 --> 01:54:59.890]
Remember that?

[01:55:00.290 --> 01:55:07.910]
It was asleep already. The 41-year-old former mentally worker faces the death penalty under Afghanistan's Islamic laws for becoming a Christian for Christ's sakes.

[01:55:08.210 --> 01:55:14.670]
His trial has fired passions in this conservative Muslim nation and highlighted the conflict of values between Afghanistan and its Western backers.

[01:55:14.670 --> 01:55:18.130]
As in, let's take him back into the dark ages. Oh, excuse me, they already are there.

[01:55:18.850 --> 01:55:24.350]
Rejecting Islam is insulting God. We won't allow God to be humiliated. If this is even worse than those cartoons, I think.

[01:55:24.650 --> 01:55:27.970]
This man must die since cleric Abdul Rolf, who was considered a moderate.

[01:55:28.510 --> 01:55:32.550]
It was jailed three times for opposing the Taliban before the hardline regime was out in 2001.

[01:55:33.230 --> 01:55:41.030]
The trial which began last week has caused an international outcry. George W. said he's deeply troubled by the case, expect Afghanistan to honor the universal principle of freedom.

[01:55:41.030 --> 01:55:45.390]
What's he going to start honoring if that's your question? You jackass, you goofball.

[01:55:45.590 --> 01:55:51.610]
Rice spokesman Sean McCormick said she told cars, it's important for the Afghan people to know that freedom of religion is observed in their country.

[01:55:51.850 --> 01:56:00.310]
Sure it is. Not just like in this country. Not. South Carolina is going to become a Christian state. All the Kansas, the anti-evolutionary state.

[01:56:00.410 --> 01:56:04.010]
Of course, you notice in Kansas it's appropriate because they haven't evolved. That's right.

[01:56:04.390 --> 01:56:09.350]
They're still in the stone age. Keeping my body dull is from Kansas and he's the spokesman for a viagra.

[01:56:09.350 --> 01:56:13.410]
Her direct appeal to the before and leader in judicial proceeding in their own country was unusual.

[01:56:13.490 --> 01:56:19.150]
But in deference to the country's sovereignty, rice evidently did not demand specifically that the trial be halted into the defendant released.

[01:56:19.490 --> 01:56:22.670]
This is clearly an Afghan decision and we don't want to harm them, she said.

[01:56:23.730 --> 01:56:31.730]
Ooh, that was bad. German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters she received the sureances from cars that had a telephone call that Russ Maum would not be sentenced to that.

[01:56:31.730 --> 01:56:36.950]
They'll just pick them to pieces. They'll pull out his fingernails and eyelids. They'll get the shaw for random to savac.

[01:56:37.770 --> 01:56:39.310]
They'll a rand gang back in.

[01:56:40.130 --> 01:56:44.790]
Diplomats have said the Afghan or maybe they'll get what's his name? What's the ton ton McCute? Is never they got in the Haiti?

[01:56:45.090 --> 01:56:49.430]
Oh, that's right. The ton ton McCute. They know how to, they know it torture really well. They're not better than the baby.

[01:56:50.810 --> 01:56:54.250]
Diplomats have said the Afghan government is searching for a way to drop the case on Wednesday.

[01:56:54.250 --> 01:56:58.350]
The authorities said Rossman suspected they mentally ill. Well, he's a Christian, isn't he? He converted.

[01:56:58.350 --> 01:56:59.330]
Right. Well, he's a.

[01:56:59.410 --> 01:57:07.330]
I don't know psychological exams to see whether he's fit to stand trial, but three Sunni preachers in the she out one interview by the AP and four of Cobbl's most popular mosques said they don't believe

[01:57:07.330 --> 01:57:14.350]
Rockman's insane. The man behind the mosque. Is that zero or was that what's that guy the movie you saw the prevent that V for Vendetta.

[01:57:14.650 --> 01:57:20.810]
He's not crazy. When from the median confessiving Christians said how medulla she's cleric at Haji yet the aquab mosque.

[01:57:21.310 --> 01:57:25.230]
The government is scared of the international community, but the people will kill him if he's freed.

[01:57:25.610 --> 01:57:32.450]
Ralph was a member of the country's main Islamic organization, the Afghan Ulamaconsel, compared the government is playing games that people will not be fooled.

[01:57:32.730 --> 01:57:38.230]
Cut off his head. He explained sitting in courtyard outside Harati mosque or for his head. Yeah, off with this head.

[01:57:38.350 --> 01:57:43.830]
We'll call on the people to pull him into pieces so there's nothing left. He said the only way for Rossman to survive would be for him to go into exile.

[01:57:44.290 --> 01:57:45.850]
Send another French Riviera with Osama.

[01:57:45.850 --> 01:57:48.750]
This is nearly Rossman video clip.

[01:57:49.850 --> 01:57:51.050]
This is the piece of earth street.

[01:57:51.610 --> 01:57:52.830]
This is the piece of earth street.

[01:57:54.170 --> 01:57:56.530]
Friday you bastard.

[01:58:00.790 --> 01:58:01.470]
Oh!

[01:58:02.010 --> 01:58:06.270]
In a face that fails just like the bad day I lose you.

[01:58:06.610 --> 01:58:11.310]
It's like a Christmas drive that dreams every week to the end.

[01:58:11.690 --> 01:58:14.250]
Just call the free version for the day.

[01:58:16.530 --> 01:58:20.690]
But you know you got to do it just after you're there.

[01:58:21.630 --> 01:58:23.610]
Who wants a sex with sound?

[01:58:23.610 --> 01:58:26.490]
Raccoon.

[01:58:53.610 --> 01:58:54.430]
That was exactly what he said.

[01:58:54.730 --> 01:59:15.250]
That looks to me.

[01:59:18.450 --> 01:59:22.270]
Especially since my wife said,

[01:59:23.290 --> 01:59:23.450]
she probably hasn't said anything before.

[01:59:23.450 --> 01:59:23.450]

[01:59:23.450 --> 01:59:23.450]

[01:59:23.450 --> 01:59:23.450]

[01:59:23.450 --> 01:59:23.590]
By the way, when we witness you,...

[01:59:23.590 --> 01:59:23.590]

[01:59:23.590 --> 01:59:23.590]

[01:59:23.590 --> 01:59:26.510]

movie with him in it if you paid me by the second now here's this story we

[02:02:12.230 --> 02:02:16.650]
do want to get to this this this is exactly where it's at yeah this is from the

[02:02:16.650 --> 02:02:19.790]
West early sun in West early Rhode Island I never heard of West early Rhode Island

[02:02:19.790 --> 02:02:23.750]
but it's in Rhode Island so how big can it be right right right still Rhode Island

[02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:26.330]
education officials have banned from public schools they're federally

[02:02:26.330 --> 02:02:29.930]
funded actions program the civil rights advocates said embraced sexist

[02:02:29.930 --> 02:02:33.130]
stereotypes and included a voluntary student health survey that violated

[02:02:33.130 --> 02:02:36.710]
privacy laws lawyers at the Rhode Island affiliate of the ACLU first

[02:02:36.710 --> 02:02:40.370]
complaint last year that a now abandoned textbook used by heritage of Rhode Island

[02:02:40.370 --> 02:02:43.830]
taught students the girls who were clothing that doesn't invite lustful thoughts

[02:02:43.830 --> 02:02:47.970]
from boys maybe a burger would be great disagree with that logic the book

[02:02:47.970 --> 02:02:52.530]
described men as strong and courageous while women were called caring weak a

[02:02:52.530 --> 02:02:57.570]
speaker on the company strong and caring men courageous a speaker on the

[02:02:57.570 --> 02:03:00.710]
company videotapes and accidents helped him honor my relationship with Jesus

[02:03:00.710 --> 02:03:03.670]
although heritage officials said the tape was news in public schools

[02:03:03.670 --> 02:03:07.030]
accidents helped him honor his relationship with Jesus I don't really had a

[02:03:07.030 --> 02:03:10.150]
relationship with Jesus and of course who would want to do a guy like that

[02:03:10.150 --> 02:03:13.770]
anyway would it awful outfit and those sandals on to which they correct them

[02:03:13.770 --> 02:03:16.790]
had these incredible sexist viewpoints about men and women and boys and girls

[02:03:16.790 --> 02:03:20.350]
it seemed to come out of the 19th century since Stephen Brown executive

[02:03:20.350 --> 02:03:24.110]
director of Rhode Island ACLU authorities at the private health education

[02:03:24.110 --> 02:03:27.370]
firms said they stopped using the disputed materials a year ago the issues

[02:03:27.370 --> 02:03:30.550]
they're asking about are old dead stuff said Chris plant I wonder if he's

[02:03:30.550 --> 02:03:33.870]
kind of Jacques clod executive director of the heritage of Rhode Island he said

[02:03:33.870 --> 02:03:36.550]
he plans to meet the spring with state education officials to work at a

[02:03:36.550 --> 02:03:40.050]
mutually acceptable curriculum to mention the heritage programs affected

[02:03:40.050 --> 02:03:43.070]
the students had also been asked to complete a voluntary survey and class that

[02:03:43.070 --> 02:03:46.410]
included questions about their sexual history the survey and students to

[02:03:46.410 --> 02:03:50.090]
provide their birthdays and the first letter of their first name this is a hint

[02:03:50.090 --> 02:03:53.310]
heritage officials use information from the survey in fact maybe the Catholic

[02:03:53.310 --> 02:03:58.010]
Church is going to start to pick up a idea from that you know ever have rings

[02:03:58.010 --> 02:04:02.090]
about the divellum the priest the father no the official's huge information from

[02:04:02.090 --> 02:04:05.750]
the surveys to track changes in student opinion before during an after classes

[02:04:05.750 --> 02:04:09.330]
we know he's the survey anymore because we thought the concerns of the ACLU

[02:04:09.330 --> 02:04:13.970]
were valid plant said as Jacques plant was that Roger plant they complained from

[02:04:13.970 --> 02:04:16.930]
ACLU as part of a national effort to monitor the curriculum of federally

[02:04:16.930 --> 02:04:20.070]
funded abstinence programs in February the federal government agreed to stop

[02:04:20.070 --> 02:04:23.230]
funding one abstinence initiative because it allegedly used tax money for

[02:04:23.230 --> 02:04:27.110]
religious purposes wonder how Robert Campbell the professor is doing probably dead

[02:04:27.970 --> 02:04:32.310]
Robert Campbell who heritage of Rhode Island had a three-year grant from the

[02:04:32.310 --> 02:04:35.030]
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that provides over 400 grand

[02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:38.130]
annually department spokesman said the group has presented a school of

[02:04:38.130 --> 02:04:41.990]
more than 600 public school students and providence potucket and wound socket

[02:04:41.990 --> 02:04:46.510]
oh god there's nothing like a wounded socket potuckets top school official

[02:04:46.510 --> 02:04:49.310]
complaint that he was duped by heritage officials and halted the program even

[02:04:49.310 --> 02:04:52.570]
before a parent complaint the ACLU we really don't probably get any religious

[02:04:52.570 --> 02:04:55.570]
opinion the school system I think basically that's what they're trying to do

[02:04:55.570 --> 02:04:59.230]
here that's what they were trying to do here potucket school superintendent Hans

[02:04:59.230 --> 02:05:03.770]
Delie said whatever's name is Hans in your ponds and letter issued last week

[02:05:03.770 --> 02:05:07.430]
education center commissioner Peter McWalter said the heritage classes were

[02:05:07.430 --> 02:05:10.350]
never approved by state authorities he announced his office would review the

[02:05:10.350 --> 02:05:13.250]
health and AIDS curriculum of every school in the state they need guidance

[02:05:13.250 --> 02:05:16.790]
that's the real issue he said plant-setters instructors work with public school

[02:05:16.790 --> 02:05:20.070]
teachers to provide a clear and unapologetic message backing sexual

[02:05:20.070 --> 02:05:23.770]
asexual abstinence the textbook that earth ACU officials came with curriculum

[02:05:23.770 --> 02:05:27.290]
materials persons from a South Carolina group plant study dropped a book after

[02:05:27.290 --> 02:05:30.750]
parent complaint out of the box from South Carolina things just don't translate

[02:05:30.750 --> 02:05:34.110]
here plant said we realize this is going to take a whole working over but it was

[02:05:34.110 --> 02:05:37.230]
a good place to start yeah nothing to be fine in the throwaway books from

[02:05:37.230 --> 02:05:41.030]
Carolina because we know where that the drift of acrobat hey there's a we know that

[02:05:41.030 --> 02:05:45.590]
drift like you knew the new sales manager got a crystal what's the name Jones I

[02:05:45.590 --> 02:05:48.930]
wonder if he's from five he knows from Bob Jones University Santa come like that

[02:05:48.930 --> 02:05:52.410]
he's from Raleigh remember only from all North Carolina or I'm not sure if he's

[02:05:52.410 --> 02:05:55.050]
a real heavy affected I think it's a phony accident probably from the

[02:05:55.050 --> 02:05:58.910]
real trust me nine hundred and sixty two votes will have that thousand before

[02:05:58.910 --> 02:06:06.250]
Josh can retract his comments about very well this is me Rogers this is five sixty

[02:06:06.250 --> 02:06:12.510]
two eight it's not just the one to two hour it's a phenomenon

[02:07:12.530 --> 02:07:17.250]
and you're in the elephant party maybe or else all of us good religion is

[02:07:17.250 --> 02:07:20.170]
they're gonna make sure you go straight to hell and we're praying for it right

[02:07:20.170 --> 02:07:24.630]

confabulate about Barry Collins no I don't want to talk about it look it's a matter

[02:07:30.810 --> 02:07:33.790]

[02:07:33.790 --> 02:07:37.390]
same thing and you could argue statistics from one era to another doesn't mean

[02:09:02.650 --> 02:09:05.530]
Dubai ports dispute the Bush administration is having a Hong Kong

[02:09:05.530 --> 02:09:08.990]
conglomerate helping tech nuclear materials inside cargo passing through the

[02:09:08.990 --> 02:09:12.610]
Bahamas of the US and elsewhere a Hong Kong conglomerate communist that

[02:09:12.610 --> 02:09:16.470]
communist uh wonder how your people now are so how enchanted they are with the

[02:09:16.470 --> 02:09:19.730]
Bush moisture what do you think not a lot lately you know the whole immigration

[02:09:19.730 --> 02:09:22.750]

Southwest Texas right Arizona New Mexico wet back dry back wet back go back

[02:09:31.390 --> 02:09:34.990]
and Chris they got in all them tunnels you know dug out there wouldn't be

[02:09:34.990 --> 02:09:37.750]
something if one of them actually did go to China that would be good yeah

[02:09:37.750 --> 02:09:40.590]
that'd be better the administration acknowledges the one know they got they

[02:09:40.590 --> 02:09:43.970]
already overcrowded over there in fact that we need to send some of the most

[02:09:43.970 --> 02:09:47.710]
of the Chinese aren't there anymore they're here oh and probably in Vancouver and

[02:09:47.710 --> 02:09:52.350]
San Francisco and LA all the people from Korea Taiwan Vietnam and China are on

[02:09:52.350 --> 02:09:56.390]
uh West Coast of the US and Canada and here in Toronto 80 million of them here

[02:09:56.390 --> 02:10:00.090]
the administration acknowledges the nobid contract with Hutchinson Wampoa

[02:10:00.090 --> 02:10:03.670]
limited Wampoa represents the first time a foreign company would be involved

[02:10:03.670 --> 02:10:06.990]
in running a sophisticated US radiation detector and overseas port without

[02:10:06.990 --> 02:10:11.590]
American customs agent present oh oh free port in the Bahamas is a 65 miles from

[02:10:11.590 --> 02:10:14.830]
the US coast where cargo would likely be inspected again the contract is

[02:10:14.830 --> 02:10:18.370]
currently being finalized administration is negotiating a second nobid

[02:10:18.370 --> 02:10:21.830]
contract for a Filipino company to install radiation detectors in its home

[02:10:21.830 --> 02:10:25.270]
country according to documents obtained by the A&P it dozens of other

[02:10:25.270 --> 02:10:28.510]
overseas ports foreign governments are primarily responsible for scanning cargo

[02:10:28.510 --> 02:10:31.630]
now President Bush recently made sure Congress that foreigners would not

[02:10:31.630 --> 02:10:35.170]
manage security US ports the Hutchinson deal in the Bahamas illustrates how the

[02:10:35.170 --> 02:10:38.950]
administration is relying on foreign companies that overseas ports to safeguard cargo

[02:10:38.950 --> 02:10:43.090]
heading to the USA Hutchinson Wampoa is the world's largest of course pretty soon we're

[02:10:43.090 --> 02:10:47.290]
going to be eating out of the Chinese's hand you do understand that don't you begging for

[02:10:47.290 --> 02:10:51.410]
rice with a bowl they got all our loans man they're without the Chinese we'd be bankrupt

[02:10:51.910 --> 02:10:54.650]
Hutchinson Wampoa is the world's largest ports operator and among the

[02:10:54.650 --> 02:10:58.130]
industry's most respected companies it was an early adopter of US anti-terror

[02:10:58.130 --> 02:11:03.070]
measures but it's billionaire chairman Lee Kashin Kashin like the son of a cash

[02:11:03.070 --> 02:11:06.530]
register Lee Kashin also has substantial business ties to China's government

[02:11:06.530 --> 02:11:09.930]
that have raised US concerns over there is that's the one Kashin kind of like

[02:11:09.930 --> 02:11:13.830]
that sound Tommy had that's blocked before that promo that raspberry sound

[02:11:13.830 --> 02:11:18.430]
Rahe Lee Kashin is pretty close to a lot of senior leaders of the Chinese government

[02:11:18.430 --> 02:11:21.870]
and the Chinese Communist Party said Larry M. Wartsle had a US government

[02:11:21.870 --> 02:11:25.290]
commission that studies China's security and economic issues the Wartsle said

[02:11:25.290 --> 02:11:28.790]
Hutchinson operates independently from Beijing and he described Lee as a very legitimate

[02:11:28.790 --> 02:11:33.010]
international businessman one can conceive legitimate security concerns and would hope

[02:11:33.010 --> 02:11:36.490]
either the Homeland Security Department or the intelligence services of the US were very

[02:11:36.490 --> 02:11:41.370]
hard to satisfy those concerns Wartsle said all confidence is high yeah somebody's high

[02:11:41.370 --> 02:11:44.550]
three years ago the Bush administration effectively blocked a Hutchinson

[02:11:44.550 --> 02:11:49.090]
Simeonia right from buying part of a bankrupt US telecommunications company global crossings

[02:11:49.090 --> 02:11:53.290]
on national security grounds and US military intelligence report once marked secret

[02:11:53.290 --> 02:11:57.350]
said at Hutchinson in 99 as a potential risk for smuggling arms and other

[02:11:57.350 --> 02:12:00.590]
prohibited materials in the US from the Bahamas mine but now they're good guys

[02:12:01.110 --> 02:12:04.310]
Hutchinson's port operations in the Bahamas in Panama could provide a conduit

[02:12:04.310 --> 02:12:07.970]
for illegal shipments of technology or prohibited items from the west of the PRC

[02:12:07.970 --> 02:12:10.970]
peoples in public of China or facilitate the movement of arms and other

[02:12:10.970 --> 02:12:14.970]
prohibited items into the Americas the now declassified assessment says

[02:12:14.970 --> 02:12:18.630]
the CIA currently has no security concerns about Hutchinson's port operations

[02:12:18.630 --> 02:12:21.930]
and the administration believes the pending deal with the foreign company would be safe

[02:12:21.930 --> 02:12:24.710]

[02:24:02.790 --> 02:24:02.790]

[02:24:02.790 --> 02:24:02.810]
Hey

[02:24:06.330 --> 02:24:06.810]
uh

[02:24:22.730 --> 02:24:23.090]
The

[02:24:23.090 --> 02:24:27.130]
Funny past one don't pee off the air of street. I'm telling that right now or on the air of street

[02:24:27.550 --> 02:24:30.090]
That what they got gutters for it is kind of dry there in the ditch

[02:24:30.090 --> 02:24:34.930]
I guess here's what it says how about the Olsen twins together for the fullest of course they're not of legal age

[02:24:34.930 --> 02:24:40.010]
Don't get out of here not legal age my ass. No, that isn't how well about the Olsen twins?

[02:24:40.510 --> 02:24:47.510]
Certainly illegal age now looking. Oh, how about Johnny Olsen? What year would they have had to have been born in mr. Math?

[02:24:47.910 --> 02:24:49.410]
To be illegal age. Yes

[02:24:50.170 --> 02:24:51.730]
6 and 12 is 88

[02:24:53.090 --> 02:24:57.610]
86 I see their legal age or 12 how hard is that to be about if it's 86 in 2006?

[02:24:58.050 --> 02:25:03.170]
I mean Jesus even my little dog would know that's 20 years for Christ's sake. Well, he might but I don't oh god

[02:25:03.170 --> 02:25:08.830]
You're a math quizzling there you go and then he rates so they're 20 and then what about them? You want to put them on air or

[02:25:08.830 --> 02:25:11.930]
But I want he can have them. I mean you can have them both

[02:25:12.470 --> 02:25:14.230]
They're almost one person

[02:25:15.250 --> 02:25:20.430]
Oh, I still think Johnny Olsen and Rod Roddy Rod Roddy. He was about eight people. That's why he's dead

[02:25:20.950 --> 02:25:23.230]
They could I hope not oh brother

[02:25:23.230 --> 02:25:27.210]
Maybe there's we're still wearing some of them fancy shiny a Taiwanese suits used to buy

[02:25:27.210 --> 02:25:30.910]
The breast cancer that's how one is a Thailand. Yeah, he's a matter of fact

[02:25:30.910 --> 02:25:33.350]
I think he did well the maybe other movies a nice period

[02:25:33.350 --> 02:25:38.050]
a rise pair and used to go over to a Thailand all the time to buy the silk suits and also buy

[02:25:38.050 --> 02:25:40.710]
Whatever else suited as fancy. Yeah, I said I won't

[02:25:41.370 --> 02:25:44.590]
Hey Rod you fairy. That's what Joey Reynolds told me anyway

[02:25:44.590 --> 02:25:48.070]
Can't think of too many other things during Reynolds that were told me that were useful information

[02:25:48.070 --> 02:25:52.670]
But not that I cared about that come on down. Oh anyway, as the bread blog

[02:25:52.670 --> 02:25:57.990]
There's some of the blogs that some good information and raw story picks up some of that stuff. I like raw story

[02:25:58.450 --> 02:26:00.950]
Grand blog.com as they broke on Wednesday

[02:26:00.950 --> 02:26:03.630]
I lost it was filed yesterday in San Francisco Superior Court

[02:26:03.630 --> 02:26:08.290]
The man in that California Secretary State Bruce McPherson filed a statement federal law in regard to his recent

[02:26:08.290 --> 02:26:12.570]
Reciprocation of Diabol voting machines in the state their bad machines man

[02:26:12.570 --> 02:26:18.230]
McPherson is named along with 18 California County registrars is dependence in the suit which calls for a ban on the use of

[02:26:18.850 --> 02:26:24.030]
Nuke and and new purchase of Diabol voting machines in the state calls for a ban and the use of

[02:26:24.030 --> 02:26:28.830]
And new purchase of Diabol voting machines in the state suit was filed by voter action.org

[02:26:28.830 --> 02:26:31.650]
I'd be have a 25 California voter-sized plaintiffs

[02:26:31.650 --> 02:26:36.890]
What is originally reported on the story as the Diabol ink suit over California voting system

[02:26:36.890 --> 02:26:40.910]
That headline is in fact incorrect. They have now reused the story with the more accurate headline

[02:26:40.910 --> 02:26:43.390]
California suit over Diabol voting systems

[02:26:43.390 --> 02:26:47.030]
The lawsuit against Diabol will be imaginable come later after California's rated women

[02:26:47.030 --> 02:26:50.970]
How they've been screwed by the company and they try to recover the millions they've lost in betting on the wrong

[02:26:50.970 --> 02:26:55.750]
voter actions the nonprofit organization who brought the actions that led to both the

[02:26:55.750 --> 02:26:57.430]
Decertification of Diabol in California

[02:26:58.010 --> 02:27:01.870]
2004 and more recently the ban on the purchase of Sequoia voting machines in New Mexico

[02:27:01.870 --> 02:27:05.290]
Which led to a new law on the state requiring a paper ballot for every vote cast

[02:27:05.290 --> 02:27:06.990]
You go in New Mexico man

[02:27:07.550 --> 02:27:10.310]
Get rid of old machines and bad machines

[02:27:11.050 --> 02:27:15.570]
That they can fix so easily and there's no doubt that they did see they still release one thing

[02:27:15.570 --> 02:27:20.070]
I'll say they're creative they they knew they couldn't steal the 2004 election the same way that the 2000 one

[02:27:20.070 --> 02:27:24.330]
Yeah, so they did it by by rigging machines in various states, you know

[02:27:24.330 --> 02:27:28.010]
Well, that's all they do that's all they do is scheme you know the rest of us are busy working right

[02:27:28.010 --> 02:27:31.710]
That's because they're just people and a compassionate conservative is in there much more

[02:27:31.710 --> 02:27:36.170]
Decent than all of us a liberal liberal Kami Pico perverts right. That's why most of them are going to jail

[02:27:36.170 --> 02:27:41.210]
Yeah, I was talking to come it back last night after I walked out I stormed out that door and you know

[02:27:41.210 --> 02:27:42.330]
I don't care who you are

[02:27:42.330 --> 02:27:46.070]
Yeah, he just cost me six thousand dollars. Anyway, I said to the raghead

[02:27:46.530 --> 02:27:48.910]
Camderaver said where he started asking about the stock market

[02:27:48.910 --> 02:27:56.050]
I said, you know, it's amazing to me that people who read like in Ryan some of these other phony baloney stocks in the tech crash

[02:27:56.050 --> 02:28:01.530]
You know, I still say the people would see NBC all belong in jail on death row including YouTube's head David

[02:28:01.710 --> 02:28:04.530]
On death row. Oh, it's the new economy against the old economy

[02:28:04.530 --> 02:28:08.750]
And then they were the ones that were propping to something they were loving because their rings were going through the roof there

[02:28:08.750 --> 02:28:11.250]
The peacock was a you know fluffing of his feathers

[02:28:11.710 --> 02:28:16.190]
Everybody in their brother the gay traders and the day traders and all another crap remember that yeah

[02:28:16.190 --> 02:28:20.530]
Everybody wanted to loosen their ass most people did because was all a pie in the sky

[02:28:20.530 --> 02:28:25.330]
It was all BS there was no new economy and a lot of these companies have barely even existed

[02:28:25.330 --> 02:28:31.150]
And they kept like goosin them up and goosin them up all these wild prices like as jeez you got any of that

[02:28:31.150 --> 02:28:37.330]
To have a sort of cabbie. I'm really surprised that some people didn't like seek out some of these a corporate in types and kill them

[02:28:37.330 --> 02:28:41.090]
You know like say like Kenny Boylay and some of these other corporate crooks

[02:28:41.630 --> 02:28:45.370]
Just amazed because you know you work all your life and then somebody screws you out of your life savings

[02:28:45.370 --> 02:28:49.010]
That's not just like OG too bad like betting on a wrong horse like that service

[02:28:49.010 --> 02:28:54.690]
That's like man. I was just led down the garden path and blew my whole retirement the money that worked for like 40 years for

[02:28:54.690 --> 02:28:58.170]
Stuff like that all of these all of these things and again

[02:28:58.170 --> 02:29:00.530]
American just like that story about this difference between

[02:29:00.990 --> 02:29:03.610]
Protests against this war now in the protest in the 60s

[02:29:03.610 --> 02:29:07.350]
America's become so passive man just like Diana said in network, you know

[02:29:08.030 --> 02:29:11.910]
They've shot up. They've effed themselves limp and how they don't know what they know they're pissed off

[02:29:11.910 --> 02:29:15.310]
But they don't know what to do about it. They need somebody to articulate the popular rage

[02:29:15.310 --> 02:29:19.290]
What a great movie and this clown here. I just you know at the very bottom thing

[02:29:19.290 --> 02:29:21.450]
It's just your opinion you can argue that one way or the other but

[02:29:21.450 --> 02:29:22.830]
I was mad at hell

[02:29:25.370 --> 02:29:32.150]
Just just for the hell of it. I'll take my chances with this all the way. I have my doubts because IMDb is hitting missed

[02:29:32.930 --> 02:29:38.710]
Heck we all know what DB we all know what the DB stands for an IMDb even though we can't sit on the air Joyce idiot

[02:29:39.150 --> 02:29:40.650]
Uh, we can say the word separately

[02:29:41.910 --> 02:29:47.770]
For example, I could say do right now and then about you know 30 seconds later. I could say oh it's in the bag see

[02:29:48.630 --> 02:29:50.370]
Okay, here's network type of n

[02:29:52.230 --> 02:29:53.070]
Good type of it

[02:29:55.610 --> 02:29:59.290]
Thank you, Mr. President for those little gas prices and thank you Al Gore for inventing the internet's

[02:30:00.490 --> 02:30:03.810]
Network 1976. It says oh, this is the one that Josh Cordis fellow sleep during

[02:30:05.150 --> 02:30:10.250]
How many stars did they give it 7.9 out of 10 almost an eight should have 9.9

[02:30:10.670 --> 02:30:15.790]
What would you give it George honest though answer out of 10? Yeah, uh seven

[02:30:21.450 --> 02:30:28.130]
You know, I never really did like you do know that I died 7.9 out of 10 and that's an IMDb which is all over the place

[02:30:28.130 --> 02:30:29.770]
How can you say that?

[02:30:30.330 --> 02:30:33.590]
It's just that was your own baby tell me what was the movie that you gave an eight or you

[02:30:34.050 --> 02:30:38.690]
That took me so long to watch city of angels city of god city of god

[02:30:38.690 --> 02:30:45.390]
I'm not a god guy city of god. Yeah, and you gave that you said that was one of the both of you were

[02:30:45.390 --> 02:30:48.590]
I mean, I mean it was good. It was okay. It was fine. I'm glad I watched it

[02:30:48.590 --> 02:30:51.270]
Thousand three right and votes by the way on the naked chicks

[02:30:51.270 --> 02:30:57.430]
But to say that that movie is better than network. I mean, that's like they're gonna drag you as a way is that that off my

[02:30:57.430 --> 02:31:01.450]
God, they're gonna there's two subjects here. What is entertainment value and the other one is the message?

[02:31:01.750 --> 02:31:07.410]
Yeah, no, nothing that was entertaining. I was entertaining. Just not as entertaining as a city

[02:31:10.450 --> 02:31:11.090]
I mean

[02:31:11.090 --> 02:31:16.090]
Which last case you never been in the broadcast business if you have been right because look at the places where you worked

[02:31:16.090 --> 02:31:17.930]
No, I don't look where you are now

[02:31:18.750 --> 02:31:23.010]
27 after one by the way John the Baker is really kicking ass. We're doing a fabulous job for him

[02:31:23.010 --> 02:31:25.990]
And we're excited about it because we like John and the food a lot especially the free food

[02:31:25.990 --> 02:31:29.770]

We're in a home Depot center just west of flamingo road and the brand new John the Baker with the Sterling town center

[02:31:49.570 --> 02:31:55.690]
On the corner Sterling and the Pine Island Road and Cooper City delicious fresh Italian goodies all your favorites like sausage and peppers

[02:31:55.690 --> 02:31:56.650]
Chicken Parmesan

[02:31:56.650 --> 02:32:03.990]
Veal Parmesan or that Parmesan is Mr. Ego would say baked CD in lasagna and like I said the best garlic rolls of size of Kimbo campers

[02:32:03.990 --> 02:32:10.050]
As they are out of this world and no forget all their fantastic subs like these sloppy sausage sub out of this world

[02:32:10.050 --> 02:32:14.110]
And the pizza is good as anything you'll find in South Florida ask anybody who's ever been to John the Baker's

[02:32:14.110 --> 02:32:15.110]
They'll tell you it is absolutely

[02:32:15.650 --> 02:32:20.850]
Positively the best there is they give you huge fresh portions nothing soggy or a gooey everything is made fresh and

[02:32:20.850 --> 02:32:25.910]
Don't forget because the prices are so reasonably you can bring the whole family call ahead for takeout in Pembroke Pines

Baby

The container appreciate fell safety inspection over and toward it

[02:34:13.290 --> 02:34:15.970]
There's not a good reason to hop on this place. It's man. It'll be safe

[02:34:15.970 --> 02:34:18.750]
And like who is in the Bronx like Virgil Solasso

And there wasn't man. I'll cap them a clusky

[02:34:23.250 --> 02:34:26.270]
So here's a fact Heather Graham for the pull we put a runner no

But they keep faxing about that. We just keep it in fact

[02:34:34.230 --> 02:34:38.850]
These are people on this pool who haven't been seen naked in right

[02:34:39.490 --> 02:34:42.550]

Preacher's wife confesses to kill him see I've been holding off on this story because I knew there'd be a resolution

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said a gap of enough information to charge her after speaking with her and getting search warrant for several locations

[02:36:20.270 --> 02:36:22.130]
Mary Winkler's not made a public statement

[02:36:22.130 --> 02:36:25.870]
But Matthew Winkler failed to show up for a midweek service at the fourth three church of Christ

[02:36:26.330 --> 02:36:27.730]
Connery and Swin looking for them

[02:36:27.730 --> 02:36:31.330]
They went to the church personage and it where no one answered when no one answered

[02:36:31.330 --> 02:36:33.190]
Connery has found Winkler dead in the bedroom

[02:36:33.190 --> 02:36:35.510]
He'd been shot in the back, but there were no signs of a struggle

[02:36:36.470 --> 02:36:42.370]
We didn't know for more than 28 hours his body was in that home TBI spoken Jennifer Johnson said must have smelled little gaming in there

[02:36:42.370 --> 02:36:46.710]
Even with a body of a preacher man that ain't long enough after the body was found authorities

[02:39:22.270 --> 02:39:27.050]
Somebody was said they're asked into beach for it and the rest of them too because if they take delivery and March beach Ford

[02:39:55.210 --> 02:39:56.970]
This is me

[02:39:58.450 --> 02:39:59.990]
This is by

[02:40:04.030 --> 02:40:04.590]
pedophile

[02:40:18.790 --> 02:40:21.270]
in

[02:40:29.770 --> 02:40:29.870]
Take

[02:40:29.870 --> 02:40:29.870]

[02:40:29.870 --> 02:40:30.030]
Be

[02:40:44.670 --> 02:40:46.670]
Is

[02:40:48.870 --> 02:40:52.730]
Everyone check the other guys. It's probably the whole theme.

[02:40:53.390 --> 02:40:57.110]
As we set a strong habit.

[02:40:57.770 --> 02:41:02.090]
As we set a strong habit.

[02:41:02.690 --> 02:41:03.530]
That's right.

[02:41:04.650 --> 02:41:06.210]
Not to mention any names, of course.

[02:41:06.510 --> 02:41:08.790]
By the way, Babe Ruth had a lifetime batting ever just 342.

[02:41:08.790 --> 02:41:10.610]
Very bonds like them, ever just 300.

[02:41:10.970 --> 02:41:12.910]
Oh, it's batting, Advertisers. So important.

[02:41:13.130 --> 02:41:17.590]
And keep in mind the pre-expansion versus post-expansion in any sport,

[02:41:17.590 --> 02:41:19.950]
whether it's hockey, baseball, any sport we try to compare,

[02:41:20.250 --> 02:41:22.730]
all time with the new time, the post-expansion,

[02:41:22.850 --> 02:41:25.150]
watered down version of the game, all these minor league pitches

[02:41:25.150 --> 02:41:26.570]
were supposedly major league pitches.

[02:41:26.910 --> 02:41:28.590]
Well, you should know that covering the Marlins all this time.

[02:41:28.730 --> 02:41:32.210]
Anyway, are you trying to tell me that players were better back then in the 20s?

[02:41:32.590 --> 02:41:36.130]
I am trying to tell you that the quality of the athlete on fewer teams was better.

[02:41:36.330 --> 02:41:37.670]
Yes, quality of the players.

[02:41:37.850 --> 02:41:39.730]
You know, that just says it all right there.

[02:41:40.230 --> 02:41:40.650]
Says what?

[02:41:40.690 --> 02:41:42.130]
No, you're good. Just go on with the show.

[02:41:42.270 --> 02:41:44.230]
Plus Babe Ruth said one lost record is a pitcher.

[02:41:44.430 --> 02:41:45.770]
How many games did the very bonds pitch?

[02:41:46.170 --> 02:41:46.350]
Yeah.

[02:41:46.350 --> 02:41:49.650]
Sports for so good people could just play all positions back then.

[02:41:49.750 --> 02:41:50.130]
That's great.

[02:41:50.590 --> 02:41:51.770]
Babe Ruth played all positions.

[02:41:51.890 --> 02:41:54.070]
No, he played pitcher and the right player.

[02:41:54.070 --> 02:41:54.790]
He played prior to your right.

[02:41:55.750 --> 02:41:58.270]
So, if anybody here in Black Panther batting average by the way,

[02:41:58.390 --> 02:41:58.950]
it's 340.

[02:41:59.030 --> 02:41:59.850]
Nobody cared about that.

[02:41:59.870 --> 02:42:01.770]
It's like, it's like, it's passed out on there that the Lord bonds it's a lever being.

[02:42:01.830 --> 02:42:02.730]
Didn't have to do steroids.

[02:42:02.950 --> 02:42:05.270]
Although he was the luckiest thing on the face of the game.

[02:42:05.430 --> 02:42:05.510]
I know what it was.

[02:42:05.590 --> 02:42:06.130]
I know what.

[02:42:06.330 --> 02:42:07.710]
The size of the lose and broad.

[02:42:07.890 --> 02:42:08.410]
You had no idea.

[02:42:09.130 --> 02:42:09.770]
Oh, Babe Ruth?

[02:42:09.950 --> 02:42:10.110]
Yeah.

[02:42:10.390 --> 02:42:10.910]
And hot dogs.

[02:42:10.910 --> 02:42:11.510]
He was a pig.

[02:42:11.670 --> 02:42:14.150]
He was a fat booze and hot dogs.

[02:42:14.150 --> 02:42:15.430]
That was his claim to fame.

[02:42:15.470 --> 02:42:17.110]
He used to shovel down like a whole bunch of winners.

[02:42:17.590 --> 02:42:18.430]
Anyway, move it along.

[02:42:18.750 --> 02:42:19.610]
We don't want to touch that.

[02:42:20.730 --> 02:42:24.510]
146, 14 to 2, a QM is a jar she just banked into a corner with the terabod.

[02:42:24.750 --> 02:42:26.870]
I'm going to go out and get that book this week and I'll prove it.

[02:42:27.310 --> 02:42:28.870]
And I'll send it to you just like I did the, um,

[02:42:29.190 --> 02:42:31.470]
Pete Rose one that we go for at 10 pages up and through the wall.

[02:42:31.470 --> 02:42:32.490]
That would be Jose Conceco.

[02:42:32.510 --> 02:42:34.030]
But I mean, I mean, Jose Conceco.

[02:42:34.030 --> 02:42:34.990]
Well, yeah, sorry.

[02:42:35.270 --> 02:42:35.870]
Same difference.

[02:42:36.150 --> 02:42:36.590]
Full of crap.

[02:42:36.850 --> 02:42:39.090]
Although Pete Rose was a better player than Jose Conceco.

[02:42:39.330 --> 02:42:41.310]
And wasn't all built up and muscled up with steroids.

[02:42:41.510 --> 02:42:42.370]
It didn't go to light of Congress.

[02:42:42.370 --> 02:42:44.370]
Although we did lie about betting on baseball, I think.

[02:42:44.750 --> 02:42:47.430]
Well, maybe let's argue about let's put Pete Rose in the hall of fame.

[02:42:47.490 --> 02:42:48.490]
You want to spend some time on that?

[02:42:48.630 --> 02:42:49.830]
I mean, we got all these people dying.

[02:42:50.010 --> 02:42:51.510]
Yeah, let's spend the 16 minutes on it.

[02:42:51.730 --> 02:42:52.410]
No, it's not.

[02:42:53.070 --> 02:42:55.210]
John Stewart plugs fine goal, censure call.

[02:42:55.850 --> 02:42:58.690]
Senator Russ Feingold goals call for centering president Bush.

[02:42:58.690 --> 02:43:00.950]
Has him one more important congress, but he won a backer Wednesday.

[02:43:01.430 --> 02:43:03.630]
John Stewart hosts of cable television to daily show.

[02:43:03.990 --> 02:43:05.530]
This feels like some attempt at accountability.

[02:43:05.790 --> 02:43:07.530]
Stewart told Feingold, Democratic Wisconsin.

[02:43:07.670 --> 02:43:09.650]
At the end of these senators appearance on the Comedy Central Show.

[02:43:09.650 --> 02:43:10.010]
One's done.

[02:43:10.150 --> 02:43:11.490]
And that's what I really like about it.

[02:43:11.790 --> 02:43:12.630]
And so I appreciate that.

[02:43:12.730 --> 02:43:13.790]
And thank you for it, Stewart added.

[02:43:13.990 --> 02:43:16.410]
And I hope that your colleagues let you still eat at the lunch table.

[02:43:17.110 --> 02:43:19.510]
Stewart, a liberal who nonetheless skewers both Democrats and Republicans

[02:43:19.510 --> 02:43:21.570]
as popular among younger viewers under the age of 100.

[02:43:22.030 --> 02:43:24.630]
Feingold's appearance on the show could help and broaden his appeal for potential

[02:43:25.150 --> 02:43:26.470]
2008 presidents or campaign.

[02:43:26.710 --> 02:43:27.290]
All we is.

[02:43:27.430 --> 02:43:29.610]
Oh, I got a problem with that.

[02:43:29.730 --> 02:43:30.530]
That what do you think?

[02:43:31.190 --> 02:43:33.590]
I would tell that it was the Congress that makes the laws the president

[02:43:33.590 --> 02:43:34.430]
supposed to sign them.

[02:43:34.430 --> 02:43:35.890]
He's supposed to enforce them instead, Feingold,

[02:43:35.970 --> 02:43:38.070]
who received an enthusiastic response from the audience.

[02:43:38.070 --> 02:43:39.650]
He's not just supposed to make them up.

[02:43:40.270 --> 02:43:43.850]
Feingold's resolution would censure the president for authorizing a warrantless surveillance program

[02:43:43.850 --> 02:43:45.590]
where it's the senator contends his illegal

[02:43:45.590 --> 02:43:48.170]
rather than making use of a law covering such wiretacks.

[02:43:48.290 --> 02:43:50.050]
White House argues that Bush was authorized to do so.

[02:43:50.370 --> 02:43:51.770]
Under his power as a commander in thief.

[02:43:52.370 --> 02:43:53.250]
Stewart told Funnily,

[02:43:53.350 --> 02:43:56.110]
tentative response to Feingold's proposal to generate on Capitol Hill.

[02:43:56.490 --> 02:43:59.530]
So far only two senators both Democrats have signed on his co-sponsors.

[02:43:59.930 --> 02:44:02.790]
A lot of your Democratic colleagues are reacting as though you're Jack Abramoff.

[02:44:02.910 --> 02:44:04.370]
And you have a casino you want to talk to them about,

[02:44:04.490 --> 02:44:06.510]
Stuart Joke, referring to the disgraced lobbyist.

[02:44:07.070 --> 02:44:09.370]
Feingold has accused Democratic colleagues of cowering,

[02:44:09.750 --> 02:44:11.790]
said it was important for the party to show some backbone.

[02:44:12.150 --> 02:44:13.050]
Oh hold your breath for that.

[02:44:13.550 --> 02:44:15.690]
How many times we're going to let George Bush and Dick Cheney say,

[02:44:15.790 --> 02:44:17.570]
you guys don't support the troops you're not patriotic

[02:44:17.570 --> 02:44:19.490]
and let them push us around as Feingold,

[02:44:19.590 --> 02:44:21.310]
whose appearance was by a satellite from Milwaukee.

[02:44:21.710 --> 02:44:22.910]
We have to stand up to them, he said.

[02:44:23.310 --> 02:44:24.990]
Stuart played a clip from a recent news conference

[02:44:24.990 --> 02:44:26.510]
of House Majority Leader John Bainer

[02:44:26.510 --> 02:44:27.990]
in which the Ohio Republican said,

[02:44:28.070 --> 02:44:30.310]
if Feingold, sometimes he'd begin to wonder if he's more interested

[02:44:30.310 --> 02:44:31.810]
in the safety and security of the terrorists

[02:44:31.810 --> 02:44:33.350]
as opposed to the American people.

[02:44:33.730 --> 02:44:35.930]
After the audience groaned at Bainer's comment,

[02:44:35.930 --> 02:44:38.130]
Stuart asked how long he'd been working with the terrorists

[02:44:38.130 --> 02:44:39.290]
and are they nicer than they seem.

[02:44:39.650 --> 02:44:41.410]
Oh no, there are bad bunch Feingold said laughing.

[02:44:42.090 --> 02:44:43.790]
Feingold conceded that a member of his own family

[02:44:43.790 --> 02:44:44.650]
questioned the proposal.

[02:44:45.090 --> 02:44:46.110]
My daughter called me up and said,

[02:44:46.110 --> 02:44:46.870]
Dad, what are you doing?

[02:44:46.950 --> 02:44:48.830]
This thing hasn't been done since the 1830s

[02:44:48.830 --> 02:44:50.550]
so it takes him explaining Feingold said.

[02:44:50.910 --> 02:44:52.290]
That's what I like about you, Senators Stuart,

[02:44:52.290 --> 02:44:53.630]
said you're kicking it old school.

[02:44:54.130 --> 02:44:54.530]
Oh no.

[02:44:54.890 --> 02:44:56.510]
The only president ever sent you by the Senate

[02:44:56.510 --> 02:44:58.230]
was Andy Jackson in the 1834

[02:44:58.230 --> 02:45:00.210]
for removing the nation's money from a private bank

[02:45:00.210 --> 02:45:02.250]
and defiance of the Wig-controlled Senate.

[02:45:02.570 --> 02:45:03.990]
That's what Moe said, he liked those Wigs.

[02:45:04.390 --> 02:45:05.470]
Despite the friendly setting,

[02:45:05.670 --> 02:45:07.190]
Stuart didn't let Feingold off without a dig,

[02:45:07.430 --> 02:45:07.990]
rams with Wig,

[02:45:08.330 --> 02:45:10.330]
changing the subject, if he said the McCain Feingold

[02:45:10.330 --> 02:45:11.530]
campaign finance always ended

[02:45:11.530 --> 02:45:12.490]
getting money out of politics.

[02:45:12.810 --> 02:45:13.790]
How's that going, yes, sir?

[02:45:13.870 --> 02:45:16.370]
Careistically, Feingold chuckled and responded.

[02:45:16.510 --> 02:45:17.810]
We got rid of the unlimited contributions

[02:45:17.810 --> 02:45:18.710]
raised by politicians.

[02:45:19.210 --> 02:45:20.430]
Now we have to deal more with reform.

[02:45:20.590 --> 02:45:21.470]
We called for public finance.

[02:45:22.030 --> 02:45:22.270]
Have a look.

[02:45:23.190 --> 02:45:23.890]
How do you like that?

[02:45:23.990 --> 02:45:25.450]
John Stuart and the Russ Feingold,

[02:45:25.450 --> 02:45:26.970]
there's your ticket for 2008.

[02:45:27.770 --> 02:45:28.470]
Oh, there's, look at that.

[02:45:28.650 --> 02:45:29.990]
And why this case is getting attention

[02:45:29.990 --> 02:45:31.030]
from the legal community.

[02:45:31.590 --> 02:45:32.630]
Just a short time ago,

[02:45:32.790 --> 02:45:34.250]
Boncelo, you're asked a federal court

[02:45:34.250 --> 02:45:35.630]
to hold the writers in contempt.

[02:45:35.890 --> 02:45:37.770]
Get this because the writers will lie

[02:45:37.770 --> 02:45:40.210]
on those grand jury transcripts in this book

[02:45:40.210 --> 02:45:42.390]
whose possession and publication they

[02:45:42.390 --> 02:45:43.630]
consent is illegal.

[02:45:43.790 --> 02:45:44.370]
And that's not all.

[02:45:44.550 --> 02:45:46.790]
Later today, Boncelo, you're planned to ask the court

[02:45:46.790 --> 02:45:48.650]
that the writers and publics

[02:45:48.650 --> 02:45:49.650]
are putting in the same authority.

[02:45:50.090 --> 02:45:50.670]
You're looking at this.

[02:45:50.950 --> 02:45:52.310]
Not be able to keep any profits.

[02:45:52.310 --> 02:45:52.710]
Why?

[02:45:53.090 --> 02:45:55.210]
Because they had an illegal and unfair

[02:45:55.210 --> 02:45:57.890]
business advantage they plan to say in court,

[02:45:58.090 --> 02:46:00.370]
which happens to be against the law here in California.

[02:46:00.370 --> 02:46:04.010]
Since they were in possession of the secret transcripts,

[02:46:04.070 --> 02:46:06.130]
Michael Reigns is Boncelo.

[02:46:07.870 --> 02:46:08.470]
Yeah.

[02:46:09.010 --> 02:46:11.530]
The allegations in the book are simply a rehash

[02:46:11.530 --> 02:46:15.090]
of the same tired and unsupported allegations

[02:46:15.090 --> 02:46:17.430]
that these folks have been writing about for months and months.

[02:46:18.830 --> 02:46:21.550]
Okay, if you happen to be a supporter of Boncelo,

[02:46:21.550 --> 02:46:24.130]
you probably realize from the legal standpoint,

[02:46:24.130 --> 02:46:27.750]
it's essentially impossible to stop the sale of a book,

[02:46:27.750 --> 02:46:29.990]
especially now that it's already on shelf.

[02:46:29.990 --> 02:46:31.690]
So, you can copy.

[02:46:31.910 --> 02:46:32.830]
Of course, very bonds and you say,

[02:46:32.990 --> 02:46:34.530]
this is really probably their best legal

[02:46:34.970 --> 02:46:35.330]
recourse.

[02:46:35.450 --> 02:46:37.950]
If you do not, if you happen to be a very bond critic

[02:46:37.950 --> 02:46:39.590]
and there seems to be more and more of them,

[02:46:39.870 --> 02:46:41.890]
then you say this may just be about face saving.

[02:46:41.970 --> 02:46:43.910]
Either way, we'll see Chris with the court

[02:46:43.910 --> 02:46:45.610]
decides a little bit later today.

[02:46:45.750 --> 02:46:47.290]
Okay, I'm going to go out and get that book right now.

[02:46:47.410 --> 02:46:48.590]
I'll write you a whipped up about it, George.

[02:46:48.730 --> 02:46:49.570]
Yes, even George is.

[02:46:50.170 --> 02:46:50.530]
What?

[02:46:50.850 --> 02:46:53.190]
Why do cash find a New Orleans home?

[02:46:53.350 --> 02:46:54.010]
Now we're talking.

[02:46:54.570 --> 02:46:56.410]
Trista Wright was spending her spring break

[02:46:56.410 --> 02:46:57.930]
cleaning out Hurricane Damage Homes.

[02:46:57.930 --> 02:46:59.530]
We're going to see all these kids that went over there

[02:46:59.530 --> 02:47:01.450]
to help out all the best for people in the Orleans.

[02:47:01.610 --> 02:47:02.150]
That was kind of nice.

[02:47:02.310 --> 02:47:02.750]
They made me tear it.

[02:47:02.810 --> 02:47:03.390]
Stupid, but nice.

[02:47:03.910 --> 02:47:05.370]
Well, these are the kids that couldn't get any action,

[02:47:05.470 --> 02:47:07.110]
so they figured, well, let's go do something productive.

[02:47:07.430 --> 02:47:08.410]
I know that sounds terrible,

[02:47:08.410 --> 02:47:09.910]
but you just know that's true, right?

[02:47:10.490 --> 02:47:12.730]
Trista Wright discovered some unusual papers

[02:47:12.730 --> 02:47:14.930]
among the moldy plastic board and debris in this house.

[02:47:15.270 --> 02:47:17.190]
I started raking it out of the air conditioner vent.

[02:47:17.310 --> 02:47:18.130]
I thought it was garbage.

[02:47:18.290 --> 02:47:19.210]
I was going to shovel it up,

[02:47:19.330 --> 02:47:21.770]
but I vent time to pick it up and it was a stack of $100 bills.

[02:47:22.030 --> 02:47:23.170]
And then more and more kept coming out

[02:47:23.170 --> 02:47:24.690]
the 19-year-old said, Tuesday on CNN.

[02:47:25.210 --> 02:47:27.250]
By an unofficial count, it was more than 30 grand.

[02:47:27.250 --> 02:47:29.490]
By 30,000 dollars.

[02:47:29.830 --> 02:47:31.630]
Wright and fellow students notified the organizers

[02:47:31.630 --> 02:47:33.510]
of the church mission and told the St. Bernard Parish

[02:47:33.510 --> 02:47:35.370]
Sheriff's Office, oh, these kids make me ill.

[02:47:35.650 --> 02:47:36.690]
But you would you notify anybody?

[02:47:37.230 --> 02:47:38.030]
Yeah, myself.

[02:47:38.330 --> 02:47:39.370]
Right. And my accountant.

[02:47:39.730 --> 02:47:40.550]
Name your pocket.

[02:47:40.710 --> 02:47:41.010]
Your wallet.

[02:47:41.310 --> 02:47:41.310]

[02:47:41.630 --> 02:47:42.850]
The woman who owned the house who was asked

[02:47:42.850 --> 02:47:44.770]
that she not be identified was the shock to his right.

[02:47:44.890 --> 02:47:46.050]
She was speechless, said, right?

[02:47:46.410 --> 02:47:48.090]
An Armstrong and Lannister University student

[02:47:48.090 --> 02:47:49.990]
was among 175 Georgia college students

[02:47:49.990 --> 02:47:51.430]
spending their week off volunteering

[02:47:51.430 --> 02:47:52.990]
in these cities, Arabia area.

[02:47:53.450 --> 02:47:55.270]
Deputy Gary Adams verified the identity

[02:47:55.270 --> 02:47:56.170]
of the woman who owned the home.

[02:47:56.170 --> 02:47:58.410]
Adams said, it's not uncommon to find weapons

[02:47:58.410 --> 02:48:00.110]
or medications behind the walls of homes.

[02:48:00.230 --> 02:48:02.910]
This is the biggest sum of hidden money he's ever heard of.

[02:48:03.250 --> 02:48:05.030]
It's good to see someone finding something like that

[02:48:05.030 --> 02:48:06.210]
and turning over to the proper authorities

[02:48:06.210 --> 02:48:07.170]
and the rightful owner, he said,

[02:48:07.370 --> 02:48:08.290]
I think I have to pile a crap.

[02:48:08.290 --> 02:48:09.550]
By the pocket of that so fast.

[02:48:09.590 --> 02:48:10.730]
It's okay, didn't, wouldn't you?

[02:48:10.830 --> 02:48:11.910]
I don't care who you are.

[02:48:12.050 --> 02:48:12.230]
Right.

[02:48:12.550 --> 02:48:15.470]
You just cost for $6,000 or $30,000.

[02:48:15.470 --> 02:48:15.710]
How much?

[02:48:16.090 --> 02:48:16.570]
The one story.

[02:48:18.250 --> 02:48:21.070]
The one story house was flooded in the Eves by Katrina

[02:48:21.070 --> 02:48:22.310]
and aside from the hidden money,

[02:48:22.410 --> 02:48:23.670]
none of its contents could be saved.

[02:48:23.910 --> 02:48:24.990]
Well, thank God they saved the money.

[02:48:24.990 --> 02:48:26.350]
There's money, sure, more important

[02:48:26.350 --> 02:48:27.490]
than a lot of Trotskies, you know?

[02:48:27.910 --> 02:48:29.410]
Haley Barton, a fellow student, was in the house

[02:48:29.410 --> 02:48:30.670]
with the right, said there was never a question

[02:48:30.670 --> 02:48:31.390]
of keeping the money.

[02:48:31.590 --> 02:48:33.410]
I think it's expected of us as young people

[02:48:33.410 --> 02:48:34.750]
or people of any age this day

[02:48:34.750 --> 02:48:36.450]
to go in and take it and not be faithful

[02:48:36.450 --> 02:48:37.650]
or trustworthy and turning it in.

[02:48:37.830 --> 02:48:39.690]
But that wasn't even an option for us, you said.

[02:48:40.270 --> 02:48:41.190]
To which I say,

[02:48:41.350 --> 02:48:42.090]
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

[02:48:42.090 --> 02:48:44.110]
yeah, a fool in the other money is so far.

[02:48:44.670 --> 02:48:45.530]
I'll say it.

[02:48:45.610 --> 02:48:46.770]
All I can say to you is

[02:48:46.770 --> 02:48:49.610]
$6,000 and one company.

[02:48:50.250 --> 02:48:52.290]
This is Neil Rogers.

[02:48:52.630 --> 02:48:56.170]
Oh, this is 5.16 Q.A.

[02:48:59.410 --> 02:49:03.270]
My name is Go, WQ.A.A.

[02:49:03.530 --> 02:49:05.790]
And we can sell,

[02:49:06.630 --> 02:49:08.110]
but we can sell.

[02:49:08.610 --> 02:49:10.270]
My name is

[02:49:10.830 --> 02:49:12.270]
Grafo,

[02:49:30.090 --> 02:49:40.250]
Thanks a lot.

[02:49:40.270 --> 02:49:41.350]
You die!

[02:49:42.510 --> 02:49:43.390]
Oh, you die!

[02:49:44.390 --> 02:49:45.930]
Who is the inventor?

[02:49:47.150 --> 02:49:49.270]
For such a long time!

[02:49:50.850 --> 02:49:52.450]
With the bush-try,

[02:49:53.170 --> 02:49:54.930]
Fabbling ooo!

[02:49:55.870 --> 02:49:59.070]
I ask you, what would these take?

[02:49:59.370 --> 02:50:01.270]
For them an object

[02:50:01.270 --> 02:50:05.050]
greater with a shoe-taste?

[02:50:05.050 --> 02:50:06.990]
I'm a fool!

[02:50:07.390 --> 02:50:14.250]
Who is the inventor?

[02:50:14.250 --> 02:50:14.370]
Who is the inventor?

[02:50:14.370 --> 02:50:16.170]
For such a long time!

[02:50:16.170 --> 02:50:16.930]
Who is the inventor?

[02:50:16.930 --> 02:50:17.130]
For such a long time!

[02:50:17.130 --> 02:50:18.330]
And the way you've got

[02:50:18.330 --> 02:50:21.750]
you get us we have some food!

[02:50:23.050 --> 02:50:24.990]
You know, good job us!

[02:50:25.550 --> 02:50:27.810]
We know, five, six loads

[02:50:27.810 --> 02:50:29.490]
four, two, five

[02:50:30.050 --> 02:50:32.630]
we will make new guys!

[02:50:32.630 --> 02:50:36.350]
Five, six, seven, eight, eight, eight!

[02:50:36.350 --> 02:50:37.410]
Thanks, everyone!

[02:50:38.410 --> 02:50:39.530]
Four and ninety-one!

[02:50:42.150 --> 02:50:43.870]
What we have to do

[02:50:44.630 --> 02:50:46.550]
most of our lives

[02:50:47.630 --> 02:50:50.630]
yes, whenever we were given

[02:50:50.630 --> 02:50:52.810]
through the parts of the food

[02:50:52.810 --> 02:50:53.670]
we had women

[02:50:54.630 --> 02:50:58.430]
our best and most beautiful guys

[02:50:58.430 --> 02:51:01.290]
Two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, five

[02:51:01.290 --> 02:51:03.210]
we'll change your mind

[02:51:03.210 --> 02:51:06.530]
and it won't be hard

[02:51:06.530 --> 02:51:09.290]
to find us

[02:51:09.890 --> 02:51:13.130]
of the old&trace heart

[02:51:13.930 --> 02:51:15.510]
and to you

[02:51:15.510 --> 02:51:18.870]
for the food first we own that food

[02:51:18.870 --> 02:51:20.350]
to all the food

[02:51:20.350 --> 02:51:22.230]
but we will make

[02:51:22.230 --> 02:51:24.270]
you guys

[02:51:24.270 --> 02:51:27.810]
and we'll do what we want

[02:51:27.810 --> 02:51:28.470]
to do about it

[02:51:28.470 --> 02:51:29.190]
you'll fare it

[02:51:29.190 --> 02:51:34.490]
Okay, 159, we got the Gully sitting by over to the Yanta Center and then we got Curtis from Addog for the 7th.

[02:51:34.490 --> 02:51:36.190]
