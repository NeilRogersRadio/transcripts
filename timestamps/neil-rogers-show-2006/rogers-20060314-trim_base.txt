[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.760]
Tell them people were to stick them. It's called Braketology. Oh, that's them. Wow. So I've got one for you. Yeah

[00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.100]
Apparently the Panthers. Yeah, I know I got it. Oh the five dollar charge

[00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.360]
You know something this is part of what's called being fan friendly and sufferers another reason not to be there just

[00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:25.600]
You can't draw flies in that place. This is your good buddy Alan Cohen there at the Panthers organization or some Bozo in there who made a really stupid decision

[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.940]
I would probably see this was some home. Oh, I

[00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.440]
Hear that echo again like I heard yesterday and not real happy. I just heard it too. Yeah

[00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.820]
Suppose you got a family of four

[00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:42.700]
Now they're charging each person doesn't say in the hero article it says the Panthers starting to live first will charge a five dollar fee to

[00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.100]
Anyone walking on the property for any event at Becket Landing Center

[00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.820]
They're gonna put up a big fence who he can't cross the grass, you know

[00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.680]
Just to piss off the public and do it will chase people away

[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.640]
So in other words, you got a family of four does that means it's gonna cost you $20 not to park

[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.460]
Point always just to walk in there well family of four you could actually

[00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.700]
String them together and shove two people over the fence. Yeah, no seriously was it's how many you got like

[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.360]
Family of five it's gonna cost you 25 bucks not to park just for the honor

[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.920]
We're going in and buying your tickets on top of that and paying for the overpriced crap food

[00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.900]
Alan Cohen man you are a muddy Cohen you're an idiot. We used to put people in the trunk when we go to high school

[00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.980]
Well, that's a good idea. Yeah, it's like going to the drive driving movies right? Yeah

[00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.640]
Jam guys in the trunk

[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.240]
Well, it's wrong with that. No problem with that. That's what people are gonna have to start doing

[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.000]
They're gonna have to hide their kids under their coat

[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.300]
I don't I mean I've heard of some stupid things in my life and then the excuses

[00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.100]
Well, they're tired of people are trying to work

[00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.440]
caused delays by darting through traffic coming from the sawgrass. What a pilot garbage that is, you know

[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.400]
They got traffic lights there as it is and if that's the case then pay for a couple extra security cops to stop

[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.300]
To give people to stop doing that

[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.360]
But no and then on top of it all the money is going to charity

[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.980]
The money going to charity. Yeah, that's what they said. It's going to

[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.340]
Big brothers and big sisters. I think it ought to go to big mothers as in mother

[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.940]
That's what the fans are gonna be saying. I thought it was for the pay all yorken and charity. No, no

[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.180]
They claim it's going for a charity

[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.260]
So this is just another way to screw the public once again

[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.560]
Stick it to the people that don't want to show up in the first place. Yeah, I'll pick my own building now for I think seven seasons

[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.000]
I could be wrong about that could be more and they've made the playoffs once and they're not gonna make it this year

[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.940]
Tampa one last night. They're not gonna make it this year again

[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.620]
Even with the side yorken and they won three games in a row big deal

[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.700]
Nobody cares about them first of all because there's no hockey fans

[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.660]
I mean it would seem to me that when you're desperately trying to build a fan base

[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.220]
You don't keep doing things to piss people off

[00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.040]
It's like the dolphins with the parking outrage that got there at the stadium same kind of crap

[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.060]
Only the dolphins at least you got you know fans that show up. Yeah, you would think it would be like running your business

[00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.380]
Where you know you depend on long distance phones and they don't pay the bill. Yeah, there you go

[00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.480]
How could that I'm being able to watch a direct TV? You don't pay the bill and you can't know a satellite like the beeswax

[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.680]
Like that happen, huh that could never happen

[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.800]
Hey, sir can it it does I mean I'm here trying to record these guys yesterday for the show

[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.300]
I had about 14 coaches on to talk about the basketball tournament coming up

[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.440]
Yeah, and we can't make a long distance call. Oh, yeah, I heard about that

[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.140]
Yes, in fact, they couldn't fast me anything either because it was long-time thing the last half hour of the show

[00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:38.400]
Nobody can fast me somebody over to the phone company with it. Yeah, what a joke. Well probably we didn't pay that bill either

[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.080]
Nope, that's that's exactly what it was. Are you serious? Yeah

[00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.640]
Get out of here. Are you sure?

[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.100]
Actually, they paid it with a sack of pennies and it just took them that way

[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.340]
They were still counting them. Yeah, what a joke and this is a company that's listed on the stock exchange

[00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.680]
Like I said don't look just to take the money. Okay, at least they pay us. Yeah, that's true

[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.620]
So all we can do at this point. I got a hold of my pennies like I sit down in the morning

[00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:11.960]
And I look to see if we have any new copy from certain sales people and like nothing and then for about a half a second

[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.860]
I start getting agitated and they thought what the hell do I care? I'm still getting paid you know these people just don't care

[00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:22.860]
That's what the bottom line is they can keep shuffling new sales managers in and 80 new sales people every two weeks

[00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.500]
It doesn't make any difference. They just don't care. Yeah, it's a schlock. So let's just take the money and have a good time

[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.400]
I think you have the answer. You just play music like they are their other stations

[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:38.880]
No, no, no, I'd rather come on here and open up a big mouth. Oh, okay? Yeah, it's a rare opportunity to open up a big fat mouth and spew for four hours

[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.340]
So that's what I do. I enjoy it. I love it

[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.300]
And I had that none of that I told yesterday about my good fortune on Sunday night unscathed the appearance. That was pretty good

[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.860]
Yeah, I did the same thing yesterday. I was like he man

[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:57.980]
It was a little bit of a hot streak and uh wow. I made a five figure score yesterday. Wow. Yeah

[00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.280]
Well, that's what the beast did he made a five figure score of course it had the

[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.500]
decimal points after the first three

[00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.040]
So I'm on a little streak here. Well, that's good

[00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.440]
Well, maybe maybe you can cover the apartment fees for these people's firt in your life first at the end of center

[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.800]
You know what? I'll stand out there right next to the guy who has the work for food sign and hand out five dollar bills

[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.040]
We need to fix this problem today

[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.620]
I said Michael you remarked that panthers CEO we have backed up we have people backed up for 30 minutes

[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.440]
We're more trying to get into our building after games. It's probably worse trying to get out. We didn't know what too bad

[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.260]
Well, what does that mean they have people backed up

[00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.380]
Constipated

[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.240]
Yeah, that's must be what it means. I don't know what he's talking about or back up like our facilities

[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.960]
I'm into a zillion games there

[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:49.620]
I never saw any problem with people being backed up across in the street. It's just idiotic or stupid back up like the facilities

[00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.540]
Sheeran is wonderful building and if they're so backed up and start the games at 7.30 instead of 7 o'clock

[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.700]
People used to come in at the end of the first period when they started at 7.30

[00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.100]
So you can imagine how they started seven on week nights

[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.120]
Nobody's there yet because people are most people are working

[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.100]
Or out there panhandling or something they got a schedule

[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.800]
Just have absolutely no clue on how to treat the public no clue

[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.920]
I remember when in the early days of that arena and some of the seats that they built in the corners

[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.720]
You know because Wayne wanted a lot more seats instead of fewer seats that they would you know

[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:26.540]
It looks a lot better when you got a 18,000 seat capacity and you're gonna got 14,000 people looks full

[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.300]
When you got a 20,000 seat capacity it looks like there's a lot of empty seats in there are

[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.620]
So they had to put extra seats in there

[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:38.660]
So some of the people in both seats and tickets they found that their seats overtour the corners are like about half the size of the regular seats

[00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.920]
And they're like these big fat guys sitting

[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.820]
It's like trying to sit on a on a teapot, you know, just ridiculous

[00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.140]
You know the kind of teapot that Joe Carroyo will throw it is wife that kind

[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.620]
What a joke walk in panther fan and again the story doesn't say

[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.160]
I mean it's just stupid. I mean who what how can you do that?

[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.980]
How can you charge people who don't want to park in your lot who don't want to pay you to park there?

[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.020]
It would be like it would be like a restaurant that has valet parking on you know

[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.780]
And so you park across the street for free and you walk out of their property

[00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.380]
I said oh no you'll have to give us five bucks

[00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.140]
Because you're not parking

[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.260]
Whatever hurt us such a thing paying somebody for a service they're not providing

[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.900]
Much of fascist to be asked me the panther organization and as always you know

[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.080]
There's a couple of guys here that have been very nice to me over the years and that's wonderful

[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.980]
But in terms of the way they treat the average fans out there

[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.100]
It's a disgrace and the dolphins have even worse

[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:38.200]
You can't complain about the fan-premiveness of the dolphin games because they really did like they're going to stop all in there

[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:39.780]
You know that yep

[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:45.880]
Boy you don't have like 18 if you don't have 18 press passes in like 45 forms of picture ID

[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.880]
You can't even think about going upstairs there. You know they press area

[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:49.900]
Forget about it

[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.600]
I remember when we had the games and I would be but that was always a real picnic going up there

[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.960]
To be the dirty looks like they like to shoot your ass. They probably did

[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.480]
In that place. Yeah, now that we got the new law on Florida. They probably it's a good thing. I'm not there

[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:09.120]
Probably would suit my ass if I went up well that all I can tell you is this the new head of securities name is chaining

[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.180]
Oh, I see well. I can tell you a lot

[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.660]
That I dick

[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:15.740]
Well

[00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:19.040]
Well, listen like I said we're taking the might of the banks and you're on a hot rule

[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.720]
And I'm actually starting to win a few bucks. So which is very rare for me. He's keep it going

[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.320]
Well, you said I'm gonna go today. I'm not going here today

[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.720]
I'm not either. I'm thinking about tomorrow on Thursday

[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:33.000]
Those sounds good because right nearly a Wednesday got the cleaning. See that's that isn't the great the way we make excuses for ourselves

[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.660]
Tomorrow the cleaning lady comes into well

[00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:40.100]
I could just as easily go out and go to lunch at two o'clock and sit and have it extra relaxing lunch while she you know

[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:46.020]
Only in here for 40 minutes, but no, so Wednesdays is my excuse to run off to you know where you know in the course Thursday

[00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:50.940]
We got the Marlin game so 1250 I'll be out the door like a shot like we shot out of a can

[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:58.560]
Well, what do you laugh about your life because you know, it's true. It is a great life. I'm having a good time. I'm not gonna change my life

[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:00.900]
I'm not gonna destroy my

[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:02.800]
Financial situation

[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.200]
Okay, I'm with you. Yeah

[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:12.220]
It's a more of a joy. I mean before before you know, we'll both be in a box. So let's at least enjoy it now

[00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:17.660]
All right, we'll be stopping on our grave. Oh, that bastard. Oh, well the mean time will have a good time with somebody's money

[00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:23.620]
Sounds good to me. Yeah, I think we had to start charging to five dollar fee to listen to the show is okay

[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:30.440]
If Stern can do it, why don't we do it? Yeah, maybe while that stock is dropping like a rock. Yeah, are you serious? Yes

[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:36.120]
Uh-huh, and XM 2 is a matter of fact boy. They're really off tourists XM. They got real problems

[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:43.900]
Since they signed up Martha Stewart. I think you know, that's the serious. Yeah, who did they sign up on XM some redneck? Oh

[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.780]
Yeah, Oprah that read that said that said Oprah

[00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:52.900]
That's the one and by the way the folks in Dubai have already saw that and they wanted to come and do a week shows over there

[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.520]
Not that they're trying to do with this big PR can try to repair

[00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:01.860]
They've been promised to buy two years supply of agra for Bob Dole, and that's how they got him on a payroll

[00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:08.780]
You see that he was one of the publicists. He was one of the lobbyists for them in Washington, Bob Dole. Oh limp Bob Dole

[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.420]
I don't think he's got that much cloud if he asked me

[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:17.620]
That's what the Elizabeth said. Well listen have a great day. Keep it going keep that street going

[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:21.400]
And of course now what he uh, oh my and college hoops at this stage. Wow

[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:27.880]
Oh, this is you guys like a like a smorgasbord. Yeah, this is like that rich at the buffet in Vegas exactly

[00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:32.580]
When he puts somebody else's uh ticket on his table because he didn't want to pay for it

[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.780]
Yeah, that's the true. I told you that's the redneck

[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:40.620]
Took took the ticket that they put on the table off somebody else's table and put it on his so he could hit it for free

[00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.720]
And then went to the buffet. It was incredible

[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.840]
That's probably one of the reasons he's not with us anymore, but anyway

[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.520]
Punishment, huh enough about that. All right

[00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:50.520]
You two will see you

[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:55.840]
The these expressive previous programs are those of the host guests and collars

[00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:01.300]
Take the money and run boys and girls that's my message to you. Okay, forget about everything else take the money and run

[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.140]
Don't be a fool. It's

[00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.220]
That man bite

[00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:19.440]
Four three two one and the left off

[00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.720]
Take out of the run

[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:30.500]
Use that farm and they won't ask for long see it crazy. I run go up thing all the

[00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:34.060]
I know it sounds crazy when we tucking come over

[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.080]
Maybe we can avoid passing us to the moon

[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:44.240]
Oh

[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:54.000]
You bet all I do right. So you think you are slick you think you're so great

[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.480]
Fuck beware

[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.820]
We know your country doesn't bother with diplomacy

[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.700]
You'd rather blow us up and try to get us to a great

[00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:29.340]
Oh

[00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:36.760]
10 13 and 5 60 w q a m happy Tuesday March 14 man. It's March madness

[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:43.300]
Hey, that's the basketball everybody can't use that term. They're gonna get a true trade. Oh, that's why I'd like to for example

[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:47.320]
I'm the beach sports bar. We can't say it's March madness because they trademark that expression

[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.120]
It's gonna point out where you can't say anything because everybody's got a trademark

[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:51.600]
You can't even say

[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:56.360]
We're gonna trademark that other right because say we're gonna like fine you a hundred million dollars

[00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:00.640]
Take your ass to jail 10 14 a q a m like Roger's

[00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:14.220]
Oh

[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.500]
We woke me up early this morning

[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:27.560]
Like a rotten carpet song a dinner place

[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:33.340]
I pulled the cover up over my head so I could

[00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:41.720]
But your

[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:41.720]

[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:49.120]
Even though I know you never shave under your arms. I've been trying my best not complain

[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.660]
Reminds me of my toilet

[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:58.800]
In your head wash your head brush your teeth before you're in

[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:04.060]
Right line teach straightforward your office your soul emotions

[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:06.220]
can't be

[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:06.620]
your

[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:07.520]
When

[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:16.200]
I'm gonna send you a letter, say in your soul, thinking

[00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:21.220]
Welcome!

[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:26.020]
Now when I'm driving, holding the air, I'm just clear

[00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:31.400]
Because you smell like someone's vomit makes with stale beer

[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:37.760]
I'm just a bit sad, I'm just feeling just a little bit tired of this

[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:42.720]
It's open nice for a few, you know it does exist

[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:49.760]
I don't have any blessings left to my name

[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:56.520]
And a odor like moldy wood when it was, check your pulse, you smell like a quartz bud

[00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:02.460]
When you lay your hair and wash your neck, the rest of my body is full of your neck

[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:07.720]
I've some sweet, thick, full of your armpits, you're still thinking

[00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:12.340]
Smell like happy, hot, my sweater, all the will

[00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:15.600]
10-20 QM before we do anything else, we gotta get that card to call in

[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.980]
Who both are you sure are talking noodles yesterday? Remember he was on his way home, right?

[00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.260]
That's right, bag of, we need noodle.

[00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:24.360]
We need noodle. Or, maybe that's him online too right now, WQYM, hello

[00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.480]
QYM, no, Neil, sorry about that, how are you?

[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:32.300]
Good, listen I hope those dead heads over at the Panther thing

[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.100]
Passed by their accountants and their lawyers

[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.340]
Yes, because if they're open and claiming that's going to charity

[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.660]
They're gonna have a backup because I want to receive

[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.480]
Wow, that's a good idea

[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.940]
I mean, come on

[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.300]
Yeah, that's right, it should be tax deductible if it's going to charity

[00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.180]
That's what they're claiming

[00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:52.700]
So they're gonna have to give you a handwritten receipt and it'll back it up for like hours

[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:53.680]
Thank you very much

[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:57.440]
That's a lot of ideas, nice going pal, yeah anything to stick it to them, man, we'll get to that in a minute

[00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.260]
That really pisses me off, man

[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:04.100]
Just another way, one of the most fan-honestly organizations in the first place, the way they gouge

[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:06.980]
You know, with those, those uncomfortable seats in the corners there

[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:09.940]
And the way they gouge for the food and it just never ends, you know

[00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:11.840]
And so desperate to get people in there

[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:16.820]
Oh listen, if you'll buy a season ticket, it's working like 700 free tickets per game and all this other crap, you know

[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:20.020]
And then people that are paying like 60 or 70 bucks a ticket

[00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:24.840]
Then they turn the person next to them, oh, I find out to take out the ticket for free, you know

[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:29.360]
Well, that's really nice, when you spent all that money and you find out the person sitting in the same section

[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.340]
Right next to you, I think it's for free

[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.980]
Line 9 is not the sure talking, I guarantee you that

[00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:36.420]
QAAM, hello, noodle line

[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.880]
Yeah, that was the noodle line, Toyota

[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:39.960]
What?

[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:40.960]
That was noodles

[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.900]
That was noodles, okay

[00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:45.540]
I wonder, maybe he still was great be-down noodles

[00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:50.460]
Yeah, they're in either Alabama or if you believe the collar would set it time, jica

[00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:53.240]
This is a good time for the great taste

[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.240]
Yeah, Neil, this is noodle

[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.780]
Well, that's good, congratulations to you, what an idiot

[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.260]
No wonder they called him Don Agony

[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.900]
Somebody QAAM, hello

[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:05.020]
Hey Neil, your last collar will pass right

[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:09.220]
They're gonna collect the money and then they're gonna pay a majority

[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.580]
And they'll take the tax deduction

[00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:13.980]
Yeah, that's what they're gonna do

[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.980]
You're probably right, they might not let us scam

[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:22.500]
I'll get to the dark on this thing because it's gonna piss off the very few Panther fans that remain

[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:27.300]
You know, you can sign Oli, joke it in and you can sign Robert De LaWango and all of a sudden a crap

[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.820]
And by the way, who the hell else is gonna play with them?

[00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:31.580]
You know, they already got them

[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:35.340]
But the fact of the matter is that there's so minimal interest in the first place

[00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:39.080]
You know, it'll be one thing if people were knocking down the doors to get in and people were clamoring

[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.440]
because there's such a big base of hockey fans in South Florida, which there are not

[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:47.640]
When you got a marginal sport, I mean really marginal in American, especially in South Florida

[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.380]
You think that you tried to do something that would be fan-friendly

[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:54.700]
But no, not in Miami, baby, not in Fort Lauderdale, not in Sunrise

[00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.340]
Is this your attack you guys gonna call her not? QAAM noodle line

[00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:03.200]
Hello, Neil? Yes? How are you today?

[00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:05.540]
Uh, how many QAAM, hello

[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:09.940]
Hi, Neil, it's Drew Greg DuDell, is on WJNA

[00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:12.760]
He just started about a week and a half ago, he's on...

[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:15.980]
So Tom Dick has got bad news once again on Sunday, Tommy

[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:20.520]
Missed information, he was doing a talk show in Alabama, Tom Rice

[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:21.960]
That was just until they sent them

[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.660]
That column has probably written a couple of weeks and it's there

[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:28.340]
Yeah, that's how Tom is lazy, you know, stuff is like ancient old news

[00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:31.840]
Right, well he follows Joyce Kaufman, half what he do

[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.100]
Oh, wow, I think he's called his niche

[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.400]
Thanks for the bad news

[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.380]
By the way, Nune de Tune today, Tune, Nune de Tune

[00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:43.740]
We'll have our QM vans, it's John the Baker for our daily bag of fun

[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.000]
And by the way, we won't even charge you to park there, how do you like that?

[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:47.740]
We won't charge you out

[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.880]
Even if you walk, we won't charge you to park even if you walk up

[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:55.000]
John the Baker, this is the one at 125 92 Pines Boulevard

[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.060]
That's in the Home Depot Shopping Center, the corner of Pines in Flamingo

[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.400]
With the best of Neil Stuffy

[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.380]
But third man!

[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.940]
TDs and T-shirts, which the approach seats are going by the way to a band of Pertrescu

[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:06.420]
We're not making that up, that's right

[00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:10.940]
And Roli will have a, just to strike back, even though this thing doesn't start so July 1st at the Macarena

[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:15.920]
Roli will have limited supply of pantas, parking passes to give away to people that show up there too

[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:18.100]
They like that, I like it

[00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:22.520]
Just as a way of saving us some cash and striking back and showing the Panther organization

[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.880]
How rightfully people are pissed off at this latest piece of insanity

[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:29.060]
How can we piss you people off? How can we chase you away?

[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:30.280]
You know, it's that kind of a deal

[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:31.820]
Very sad

[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:36.300]
But typical, WQA and Newtle line, hello, not there

[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.800]
Wouldn't you think that guy would have called right off the bat?

[00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:39.480]
You would think

[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:42.940]
I mean, this is information that I need to know, maybe nobody else is in the way

[00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:47.000]
That's right, of course my stuff is already coming into mail, but I'd like to find out

[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.300]
Before I just throw it all away

[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.120]
WQA and hello

[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.440]
Thank you more than Neil

[00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:55.000]
Did you know that Isaac can use his quitting without power?

[00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:57.260]
Yeah, I got to that story because he's P.O. to much

[00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.860]
The Scientologist got to him, man, make no mistake about it

[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:01.360]
It probably is right to give him a shaft

[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:05.920]
You think he was a cool guy and then he turns out to be a complete boy class

[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.000]
Yeah, I know

[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.460]
Great, I got it

[00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:10.460]
Square is a cardboard box, Isaac Kays

[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:15.260]
He's been on out of South Park doing the voice because they have to have respect for religion

[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:19.420]
And the meantime, how about the one where they did the Virgin Mary believe they had a rat?

[00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:20.080]
Right

[00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:23.160]
And all the other stuff they've done, the secular religious stuff

[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.800]
Which is hysterical

[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:29.060]
There's no loyalty, it's just like this thing about wow, you know, you're making fun of our religion

[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.040]
Well, so why not?

[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:31.060]
That's my thing

[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:32.080]
That's my religion

[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.940]
Yeah, who now cares?

[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.480]
Anyway, here's the poll from yesterday

[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:41.880]
And I forgot, we'll do it tomorrow, I've already got it laid out about who has season tickets to what?

[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.640]
I think the Panther number may be going down very fast as low as it is

[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.620]
Just when you thought it couldn't get any lower

[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:52.880]
When you go to any Marlins games this season 1310 votes, maybe a couple 341 maybe

[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.340]
No, they screwed the fans again 294

[00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:59.880]
I'll pack them sandwiches, move already, bye bye 292, 292 votes

[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.760]
I hate baseball, I'm not going no, 181

[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:06.740]
Yes, I'm going to several games, 94, that's 7%, I hate this poll, 89

[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:09.720]
And I'm a season ticket older 19, the Eastern Webbing

[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:12.360]
1.4%

[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.200]
That's not how you say it

[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.200]
How do you say it?

[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:17.720]
What's 19?

[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.040]
No, it's not the Eastern Webbing, how do you say 19?

[00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:20.880]
Guessing what?

[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:22.180]
No, it's not

[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:26.580]
All right, well in attacking they got like different words, well I don't want to go to the whole thing

[00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:29.420]
Only 19, 1.4% season ticket older for the Marlins

[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:30.540]
Wow

[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:36.680]
But, but if you do go to the Panther games they'll toss you a free bag of sure-taki noodle

[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.220]
This is Neil Rogers

[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.040]
This is 516 QA

[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:51.660]
Now, you've seen J.C. perform on the Grammys with Paul McCartney

[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:59.800]
And now, the hole becomes out of retirement

[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.540]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:05.440]
To do it with all the legend

[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:35.280]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[00:22:52.960 --> 00:23:05.200]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:35.180]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[00:23:49.920 --> 00:24:05.140]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:29.640]
Oh, oh, oh

[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.060]
and savior by Scientology leaders.

[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.340]
While a cartoon crew is lots and stuff in a closet

[00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:34.120]
won't come out.

[00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:37.160]
Stone told the AP and he and co-creator Tray Parker

[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.960]
never heard of Pete out of Isaac in any way

[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.160]
until we did Scientology.

[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.600]
He was a different stead of religions other than his own.

[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:44.880]
And to me, that's where intolerance and bigotry begin.

[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:46.680]
Ice going air, Matt and Tray.

[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:47.180]
That's right.

[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:47.700]
You go, boys.

[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.300]
God, what a jackass.

[00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:52.540]
I'm telling you, that Scientology thing,

[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.820]
it's the whole, it's almost as thick as the thing

[00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:56.860]
I saw on E&E last night.

[00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:59.880]
I had a two hour special on polygamy.

[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:00.900]
Oh yeah.

[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:02.760]
Mainly based in the state of Utah.

[00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:03.340]
That's right.

[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.740]
Where orange packs is from, by the way, Utah.

[00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:09.980]
And how about these crazy polygamy's

[00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:11.140]
than what they're doing and abusing?

[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:14.320]
And they know it's just like making life a playground

[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:15.340]
for the guys.

[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.180]
So they can bang any number of women they want

[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:20.460]
and the daughters and rape and abuse their sisters.

[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:21.340]
Whoever they want.

[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:22.180]
Right.

[00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:23.340]
Oh, here you go.

[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:24.600]
Somebody said it's the dope.

[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.260]
Look at what a line of man.

[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:27.900]
Jam and John Summers.

[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:28.340]
Woo.

[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:30.340]
Jam and John on JNA.

[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.120]
Enjoying Kaufman.

[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.100]
She's so Jewish.

[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:34.160]
It's almost unbelievable.

[00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:34.900]
Oh boy.

[00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:37.180]
And Greg Budell, longtime South Florida

[00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:39.280]
Radio star hosted the Audi like that.

[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.620]
Tom Jiffy, you blew it again.

[00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:42.780]
Maybe you don't have any clue what's going on.

[00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.120]
I know what we missed my 30th anniversary.

[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.880]
He'll probably have that in about two weeks.

[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.080]
Tom's a little bit in the behind these days.

[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.360]
The Udella hosted 640s afternoon show.

[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.180]
And it goes down but a beep.

[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.300]
But it does mention anything in here about his fine work.

[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.360]
He did the country kitchen in Hollywood as a waiter.

[00:25:59.620 --> 00:25:59.920]
What?

[00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:01.440]
Those were his salad days.

[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:01.880]
I understand.

[00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:02.420]
He can be heard.

[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:04.260]
Oh, he can.

[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.740]
And by the way, everybody still hates you.

[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:06.520]
Like poison Greg.

[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:07.200]
How do you like that?

[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:08.480]
He keeps coming back.

[00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:09.940]
He won't go away and stay away.

[00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:12.260]
He just keeps coming back like a bad penny.

[00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:13.980]
They don't like you, Greg, in South Florida.

[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:14.480]
Hate you.

[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:19.100]
Anyways, we're going to be from 2 to 6 on WJNA 640.

[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.600]
Surrounded by a special blend of South Florida's favorite songs,

[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:23.540]
targeting all adults over 40.

[00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:26.040]
Vue del is a must for any program testing the market,

[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:26.880]
targeting the market.

[00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:27.720]
Well, whatever that means.

[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:30.240]
Well, I see this is a sales propaganda program.

[00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:31.620]
Oh, it's from the iodine person,

[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.260]
who's obviously somebody inside over there.

[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:35.220]
Now that's who this is.

[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:37.100]
Now, who do we know that's over there?

[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:37.960]
Must be PD Lenny.

[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.420]
There's a lot of time, Eisenberg.

[00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:41.420]
This isn't Tom's style.

[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:42.560]
He wouldn't waste his time with us.

[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.860]
It's either Mark Eisenberg and I don't think it's him

[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:45.860]
because he hates me like poison.

[00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:47.180]
It's probably a PD Lenny.

[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:48.180]
Isn't that where he is?

[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.160]
I don't know where he is.

[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.060]
Where's he with Cox broadcasting now?

[00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:51.880]
I don't know.

[00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:54.500]
He's on the other side of the way with the iodine.

[00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:55.940]
And we cure a chrome.

[00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:58.640]
Is that guy gonna call in with the noodle story or not?

[00:26:59.000 --> 00:26:59.620]
Where's everybody's doing?

[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:00.320]
He's the way I'm noodle line.

[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:00.600]
Hello.

[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:02.340]
Neil, the sure-of-possy guy.

[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.280]
All right. See you all right.

[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:04.840]
How you doing?

[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:08.220]
You know, I'm eating it as we speak.

[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.960]
I'll tell you what, it's good, it's bland.

[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:11.800]
Yeah.

[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:15.740]
But it's got the same texture as the, like the raw men noodles.

[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.620]
Right, nothing wrong with that with raw men.

[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:18.720]
I'm impressed.

[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.120]
I'm really surprised that you put a little salt on it.

[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.380]
Like I think the people in the story,

[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.180]
they put a little tomato sauce on it or something.

[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:25.940]
But it really tastes pretty good.

[00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:26.540]
And it's cheap.

[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.860]
It was at $50 for $8 ounces.

[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:29.360]
Right.

[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:30.900]
So I'm very upset.

[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.940]
But did it not have a really bad smell

[00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:33.820]
when you opened up the sound?

[00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:34.560]
Oh, not at all.

[00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:37.020]
And it just, it's just bland and plain.

[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:38.080]
Yeah, well, let's face it.

[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:39.440]
Pasta doesn't have any taste anyway.

[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:40.920]
It's what you put on if it makes the taste.

[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:41.360]
Exactly.

[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:42.120]
So what the hell?

[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:43.500]
It's got almost no calories.

[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.980]
I don't expect it to taste great, but it's filling it.

[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.200]
And it's got a nice texture.

[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.800]
Now let me ask you, have you checked your blood sugar

[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:49.500]
after you ate it?

[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:50.720]
No, not yet.

[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.100]
Well, I would do that before you get too carried away.

[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.820]
Because some of these, I've tried some of these products

[00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:57.920]
in the past that allegedly had only so many usable carbs

[00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.360]
in the audience, and then you're

[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.720]
fine, your blood sugar is like 400.

[00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:02.920]
You know, after you've had to do that before you get it.

[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:03.440]
No cholesterol.

[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:04.180]
I understand.

[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:05.180]
But forget about that.

[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:06.380]
You know, the proof is in the pudding,

[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.320]
as you know, if you're diabetic, check your blood sugar.

[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.220]
Before you go like a crocan, honest, please.

[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:10.680]
OK.

[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:11.380]
OK.

[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.500]
But at least not, Pallee.

[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:12.820]
Pretty good.

[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:13.920]
It came through for us.

[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:14.800]
How do you like that?

[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.120]
I told you, maybe this audience always comes through for us.

[00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:19.960]
That's why we're going to raise $50 million

[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:21.660]
if the agenda maker of the staff knew

[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:22.860]
between New and two, right?

[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:23.880]
At least 50 anyway.

[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.020]
Otherwise, I forgot to tell you the total.

[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:25.640]
Well, let me go.

[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.240]
I forgot to write it down, but you gave it to me.

[00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:29.580]
Well, I had $16.475, so it's got to be more than that.

[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:30.860]
$16.670.

[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:32.820]
Well, that's not too good.

[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:34.340]
I mean, since we're getting there,

[00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:36.460]
we'll have over $20,000 by the end of this week.

[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:37.880]
Probably.

[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.120]
How long are we going to continue this

[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:40.600]
until my summer vacation till I'm

[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:41.660]
in the summer schedule in June?

[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:42.360]
That's on the day.

[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.380]
Like I said, my summer vacation?

[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:44.020]
Yeah.

[00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:45.060]
Oh, sure.

[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:45.520]
Why not?

[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.300]
Every day we're going to be doing this?

[00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:48.080]
We don't have to.

[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:49.400]
They're going to get a little ponderous.

[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:50.640]
I mean, that's OK.

[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:51.980]
We're going to kill some good time.

[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.520]
And give me a roll of some to do.

[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.780]
Go out there and meet our fine crowd

[00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:57.160]
out there.

[00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.460]
See the guy with the eyes again?

[00:28:58.700 --> 00:28:59.720]
The guy with a fanny pack?

[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.560]
Maybe a blind micro show up?

[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:04.460]
Maybe your buddy will be there.

[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:05.780]
Screaming.

[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:06.200]
Hit work.

[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:06.720]
Hit work.

[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:09.220]
So here's the story that a lot of people

[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:11.220]
already peeled about, and I don't blame them.

[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:13.460]
In the hero this morning, George Richards

[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.040]
writes sounds like a woman to me.

[00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:17.060]
What was that transvestite?

[00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:17.820]
What Richard's?

[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:18.720]
Who was that Denise Richard?

[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:19.120]
No.

[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:19.520]
No.

[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:22.280]
Well, some of the funny ones.

[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:22.940]
What do you want from?

[00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:23.800]
I don't know.

[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:24.680]
Renee Richards.

[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:25.680]
OK.

[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:26.740]
Renee Zellweiger.

[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:29.320]
I only know RuPaul and Daymedna.

[00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:31.220]
Frugal hockey fans.

[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:31.660]
My money.

[00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:33.580]
What you listen to this is the familiar

[00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:35.280]
and portante of the 40 people that go to the games.

[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:39.040]
Frugal hockey fans has paid money by parking for free at

[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:41.580]
sawgrass mills and dashing across Panther Parkway traffic

[00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:42.400]
lanes on game lights.

[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.220]
Our budget could hit in the wallet.

[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:48.820]
Starting July 1st, the Panthers will start charging a $5

[00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:50.740]
fee to anyone walking on the property for any

[00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:51.920]
event at the Bank of Land Center.

[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:53.480]
So like if it's a concert, you know?

[00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:55.380]
Because in July, I don't think we're going to be

[00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:56.280]
playing too much hockey there.

[00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:58.020]
But if it's like a concert, which I can't think of

[00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:00.500]
anything else, they're going to soak it to you.

[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:00.900]
Soak you.

[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:02.700]
Reason for the new fee.

[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:05.820]
Safety concerns in the traffic delays caused by fans

[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:07.620]
darting through traffic said Michael Yurmac.

[00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.240]
Panther's CEO and leader this season ticket holders.

[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:13.040]
We need to fix this problem that they said.

[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:13.420]
You are marked.

[00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:15.040]
We have people backed up for 30 minutes.

[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:15.980]
So 30 minutes.

[00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:17.660]
One more trying to get into our building after games

[00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:19.060]
is probably worse trying to get out.

[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:21.040]
Some fans have worth it.

[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:23.340]
It's crazy for the Panthers who frequently play in

[00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:25.680]
front of hundreds that should read thousands of empty seats.

[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:28.100]
The sock, those fans who do show up on the added fee.

[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:28.620]
That's right.

[00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:29.860]
Nobody wants to go there.

[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:31.660]
But if you want to come here and subsidize our crappy

[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:33.580]
operation, then we're going to like stick it to even

[00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:34.120]
more than ever.

[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:36.440]
And then that's really what you call fan friendly.

[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:36.920]
Not.

[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.620]
Your marks as money raised will go to charity.

[00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:42.180]
The first beneficiary will be the big brothers

[00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:43.440]
and big sisters of Broward.

[00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:45.120]
It costs 15 bucks to park a fee.

[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.100]
We know those season ticket holders can prepay for $10

[00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:47.700]
passes.

[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.240]
Free park is available to those who drive Lexus vehicles.

[00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:52.660]
So if you drive a Lexus, then it's OK.

[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:53.920]
OK, come in there for free.

[00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:55.900]
But if you're like one of those sluppers that's walking across

[00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:57.460]
the street because you don't want to get ripped off

[00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:59.640]
or parking, then we're going to soak you five bucks a piece.

[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:00.880]
Or if you can't afford a Lexus.

[00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:03.940]
And of course, people that are walking across the street

[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:05.320]
obviously can't afford a Lexus.

[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.860]
This is the best option we can come up with.

[00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:09.860]
Your mark said we think it's going to create a safer environment

[00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:11.080]
for people coming to our building.

[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.080]
Yeah, it'll be safe.

[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:12.880]
Nobody will be going there.

[00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:13.240]
Right.

[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:14.840]
It'll be all it will be so safe.

[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:17.760]
Remember that just like I wanted to have Michael to have

[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.340]
that meeting where he'll be safe.

[00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:19.860]
Uh-huh.

[00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:22.480]
Well, traffic backs up with pedestrians crossing the streets.

[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:23.700]
There haven't been any major injuries.

[00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:26.140]
And those who park at Sogrest seem upset with the decision.

[00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:26.780]
No.

[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:30.760]
Some fans say they'll just jaywalk across Panther Parkway.

[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:33.600]
That's 136th Street instead of crossing at the light and

[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:34.840]
walk it up to Plan Payment Gate.

[00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:37.280]
They're going to have a Plan Payment Gate.

[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.600]
You can just walk through the grass.

[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:41.780]
They can't control the whole area.

[00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:43.840]
I said, Mark Whisby who drove to Saturday's game from color

[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.100]
Ridge with Suns, Tyler and Steven.

[00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:47.400]
But hey, to break the news to you, Mark.

[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:48.380]
Bad news, baby.

[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:51.600]
Your mark says, if fence will be erected around the perimeter,

[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.460]
it's like a Berlin wall all over again, huh?

[00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:56.560]
If fence will be erected around the perimeter,

[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.460]
the parking lots of the Scrooge fans are running through

[00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:00.580]
traffic under arena property without paying.

[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:03.200]
That sounds like an offensive fence.

[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.460]
I'm not surprised because people try to make a buck

[00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:06.080]
wherever they can.

[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.580]
This is another sneaky way of making a dollar

[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:09.720]
said, fan, jay, pagan, a West Palm Beach.

[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.380]
What if he's can do a Jose Pagan?

[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:15.400]
If there's not a big outcry, they're going to get away with it.

[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:17.080]
For me, it's not going to stop me from coming to games,

[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:18.420]
but it's going to be hard to enforce.

[00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:20.500]
You're a marketer of those parks that the arena

[00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:22.420]
who want to walk to them all will get special passes

[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:23.620]
so not to be charged twice.

[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:26.180]
Oh, isn't that, isn't that Gentile?

[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:27.840]
Ooh, maybe they can start my forehead.

[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:29.560]
But fans are still grumbling.

[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:30.860]
Not that would be for Ask Wednesday.

[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.220]
It's ridiculous that West Palm Beach

[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:34.400]
is one of the things that's nice about this arena

[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.380]
is people can come up here, spend the day at the mall

[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:37.520]
and walk across and go to the game.

[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:38.980]
It's convenient heading them all so close.

[00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:40.100]
Well, that's what you thought.

[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.060]
Your mark says the team has been working on the problem

[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:43.460]
for months.

[00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:46.020]
He added he has informed Sunrise as well as Broward County.

[00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:47.560]
Broward County is about the new deal.

[00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:48.960]
The raw deal.

[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.800]
The arena was built with county tax money

[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:52.060]
and the team runs the arena for the county.

[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.180]
Your mark said he's spoken with soggrats official

[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:56.160]
in the past, not the pedestrian bridge would be feasible.

[00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:58.000]
Redirecting traffic to other arena

[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.140]
and this is also being looked at.

[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:00.800]
Although most two park at the main gate

[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:01.760]
where the pedestrians cross,

[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:03.020]
our high money customers

[00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:04.280]
who pay a premium for parking there.

[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.160]
When this building was built,

[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.920]
it was never contemplated there would be walkovers

[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:08.940]
from the mall, he said,

[00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:09.960]
oh, that was good planning.

[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:11.880]
Just like they had no drain.

[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.160]
They had no drain system there.

[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.160]
I remember that one day was flooded

[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.060]
with like swimming through the lake

[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:16.100]
to get to your car after the game.

[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.080]
We know this is a major issue.

[00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:19.500]
We think we come up with the best solution.

[00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:22.340]
This isn't the first time a pro sports team has tried

[00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:23.340]
to discourage fans from parking

[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:24.340]
for free and walking the games.

[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:26.840]
In 2000, the Redskins began closing off streets

[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:27.900]
around the suburban stadium,

[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.500]
forcing fans who parked for free

[00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.800]
near by land over Malta Pay for a bus ride to the stadium.

[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:33.360]
Four years later,

[00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:34.500]
the board of administrative appeals

[00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:35.840]
and Prince George's County Merlin said

[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.340]
the road to the Colleges were improper.

[00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:38.740]
Three parking was resumed

[00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:40.240]
for those willing to make the hike to the stadium

[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:40.940]
and it should be,

[00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:43.560]
this should be next right now before they start, okay?

[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:44.840]
It's only the 14th of March.

[00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:45.940]
Don't do it.

[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:48.420]
You people in Broward,

[00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:49.480]
you politicians out there,

[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:51.480]
it's a Broward County deal.

[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.020]
Maybe the County Commission should mix this,

[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.480]
nip it in the bud, okay?

[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:55.340]
It's unacceptable.

[00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:58.180]
And this crap about the money's going to cheer it.

[00:33:58.220 --> 00:33:58.840]
You like to hear what I said?

[00:33:58.940 --> 00:33:59.300]
If you're a fan,

[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.080]
it's really the case.

[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:02.180]
Then every person that they soak five bucks

[00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:03.200]
for including the little kids,

[00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:04.120]
they should have a,

[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.800]
demand a written freaking receipt.

[00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:07.660]
This is me,

[00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:09.380]
everybody be here by midnight.

[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:12.780]
This is 5'16", she fades out.

[00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:17.720]
Henry, what in Florida, Panthers?

[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.320]
Happy 24th anniversary, Neil.

[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:20.280]
Good luck to be here.

[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:22.620]
On tonight's Action News.

[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:23.480]
Action News.

[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:25.180]
President Bush is heading home

[00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:26.720]
after his first trip to Pakistan.

[00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:29.580]
President Bush also attended a quickit clinic

[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:30.780]
for high school boys,

[00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:32.860]
taking a few swings himself.

[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:34.600]
Oh, they hit him.

[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:35.300]
They're losing.

[00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:36.560]
They hit him again.

[00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:37.480]
Father's me.

[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:38.720]
They hit him again.

[00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:40.400]
Oh, right in the head.

[00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:41.680]
Oh, damn.

[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:45.640]
It's lucky he was a Pakistani pinata.

[00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:46.320]
Damn.

[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:47.740]

Don't have one.

[00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:15.860]

Hot 90.

[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:21.720]
I hate this poll said,

[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:24.580]

[00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:54.120]
Those last few categories there.

[00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:55.700]
Pretty small percentage.

[00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:58.640]
Oh, let's see to about three and a half, four percent.

[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.600]
Stuck with some stinky a slab gross.

[00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:04.000]
Well, there's one way to deal with that.

[00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:05.280]
Shoot him.

About 30 man.

[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:36.700]
It is pure genius.

[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:37.900]
Wow.

[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.820]
Congratulations on a job well done.

[00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:41.200]
Thank you for entertaining us all these years.

Well, congratulations George and Miguel for producing a great CD.

[00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:47.300]
Yeah.

[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:48.240]
So I have nothing to do with it.

[00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:50.280]
I want to keep it that way, please.

How are you?

[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:07.900]
Pretty good.

I have another option.

[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.640]
I'd like to have your poll.

[00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:11.400]
OK.

[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.560]
I can't answer this time without consulting my significant

[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:15.100]
other.

[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:17.900]
OK.

[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:19.440]
I would like to.

[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:20.160]
Yeah.

[00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:24.980]
Not right.

[00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:26.380]
72 I am.

[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:26.580]
Hello.

[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:28.360]
Neil.

[00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:29.220]
Yes, sir.

[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:33.860]
That video, that link that you have 911 loose change.

[00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:35.260]
Yeah, awesome.

[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:36.720]
Yeah, I know it.

[00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:38.360]
But it raised the many questions.

[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:39.480]
I know.

[00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:41.380]
And if you actually thought that you were going to have a

[00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:43.460]
somebody who hasn't watched the video, they're thinking

[00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:43.760]
nuts.

[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:48.240]
Well, in that case, you still tell them about it.

[00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:50.940]
Hey, man, you're the best man.

[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:53.140]
Have you ever tried that probably come and drag the rest

[00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:54.300]
away anyhow in the middle of the night?

[00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:55.660]
They'll probably turn your ass in.

[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:58.780]
Yeah, I have a couple of friends over to my house last night.

[00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:03.020]
And we watch the video because I have a big string TV and

[00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:06.320]
took up the computer and they were all glue in.

[00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:07.600]
Nobody walked away.

[00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:09.440]
They were all glued in now, but they were.

[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:09.920]
OK, listen.

[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:12.840]
Great.

[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:16.380]
They were all glued in with his big screen going more than 70

[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:18.120]
dead in a pair of reprisal killings in Iraq.

[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:18.920]
Oh, geez.

[00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:20.580]
More bad news.

[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:23.680]
You know something Ed Rollins was a Republican, the consultant.

[00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:24.140]
He was on.

[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.780]
Do you see that last night with Lou Dobbs?

[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:26.060]
Sure did.

[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:29.900]
And he said something about the good news from the administration.

[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:31.500]
Why is a rip in the media?

[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:34.140]
Because there's not talking about the good news from Iraq and Ed

[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:35.540]
Rollins says there isn't any good news.

[00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:37.240]
That was a Republican saying that.

[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.860]
There isn't any good news.

[00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:43.320]
Authorities said at least 71 bodies were found in the Iraqi

[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.520]
capital of Baghdad during a 30 hour period.

[00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:48.580]
Third man ending midday yesterday or midday today.

[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:50.900]
Excuse me, the way ahead of us in some ways.

[00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:54.140]
Sparking fears that sectarian reprisal killings are continuing

[00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:55.280]
at a grisly pace.

[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:56.320]
Grisly pace.

[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:57.560]
I'm dying out of here.

[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:00.460]
15 bodies were found Tuesday morning in a back of a pickup

[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:02.620]
in a SUNY neighborhood in Western Baghdad.

[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:05.220]
The victims all males between the ages of 25 and 40 have

[00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:05.980]
been strangled.

[00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:09.600]
Police also found 14 bodies in a shallow grave on the east

[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:11.280]
inside of the capital of Shiite neighborhood with their

[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.360]
hands tied beyond their backs and bullets through the

[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:13.520]
hay.

[00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:15.840]
And another two bodies have been shot in a

[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:17.240]
hay and were discovered in Southern Baghdad.

[00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:21.120]
Police found that they recover a 40 bodies during the 24 hours

[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.000]
that ended six o'clock this morning their time.

[00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:26.260]
It just hit on and on and on.

[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:28.920]
More instapled and died.

[00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:30.960]
Yes, she did.

[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:33.000]
When I first saw the story, I thought it was Gene Stapled.

[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:33.500]
I got right.

[00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:35.660]
Oh, thank goodness it was only more.

[00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:37.520]
When I met back she was a she was nice.

[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:38.220]
She was all right.

[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:41.160]
She won an Oscar in 81 for playing anarchist writer Emma Goldman

[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:42.660]
and Reds Emma Goldman.

[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:43.220]
Oi.

[00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:46.560]
But I have a feeling she was Irish.

Marine Stapled in the Oscar winning character actress who

[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:50.900]

screen and TV died Monday.

[00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:55.560]
She was 80.

[00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:56.640]
That's old enough.

[00:39:57.860 --> 00:39:58.620]
Stapled in a long time.

[00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:01.160]
So you see it's only not old enough if you're like 78.

[00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:01.440]
Right.

[00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:03.300]

To prepare for the rule she sent you tried reading Goldman's

[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:19.000]
autobiography but soon chucked it out of boredom.

[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:20.360]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:22.580]
She was nominated several times for supporting actress

And his wife Kathleen Abigail to mark in 41 right

[00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:28.700]
Before trying to stripping

[00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:29.800]
And then making the decision

[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:30.660]
Whether the world has studied

[00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:31.200]
Or it's sex.

[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:32.840]
I kind of wanted to be a porn star

[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:33.960]
She said I wasn't raked in it

[00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:34.620]
Or abused.

[00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:35.820]
With the Lutheran grandmother

[00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:36.920]
Curious issue attended church

[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:38.020]
Regularly aged 12.

[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:40.080]
Despite having numerous sexual

[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:41.540]
Partners, she remains proud of her

[00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:42.160]
Occupation.

[00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:44.100]
I probably have less sex

[00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:44.880]
With those guys than they

[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:45.960]
College girl typically has

[00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:47.700]
It doesn't make me less moral, she said.

[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:48.820]
I'm sure a lot of Christians

[00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:50.220]
Have had sex before marriage.

[00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:51.180]
God reads my heart.

[00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:51.880]
I'm a good person.

[00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:53.140]
I think I have morals.

[00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:53.800]
More morals.

[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:54.960]
And the politicians at Orifice.

[00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:56.480]
I don't robs the Ohrter Lion.

[00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:57.860]
A lot of politicians do that.

[00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:59.400]
Like the one she's having dinner with.

[00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:01.220]
When asked about Bible verses

[00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:02.540]
Condemning adultery, she responded.

[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.200]
Bill Clinton committed adultery.

[00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:05.600]
Doing it all movies is acting

[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:06.380]

[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:07.300]
It's not burial and cook

[00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:07.880]
The real me.

[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:08.880]
That's right.

[00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:09.080]
Yeah.

[00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:10.700]
Now, see he was a bad guy.

[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:11.360]
She's good.

[00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:12.160]
He doesn't for a living.

[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:13.160]
She gets paid for it.

[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:14.180]
That makes you think that she needs

[00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:15.200]
To satisfy his lust.

[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:17.480]
And the fact he's married to a frigid bulldyk.

[00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:19.440]
You figure it out.

[00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:22.520]
Okay, I guarantee we're getting

[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:23.700]
Closing in 947.

[00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:25.560]
Oh, thank heaven for 947.

[00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:28.080]
My spouse or a significant

[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:29.140]
Other is a treasure.

[00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:29.980]
180.

[00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:31.040]
That is so sweet.

[00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:32.080]
And that.

[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:33.140]
Yeah, yes.

[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:34.120]
We're already well past

[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:34.920]
Valentine's day.

[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:36.700]
Don't have one 175.

[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:37.520]
Congratulations.

[00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:38.780]
Of course, they could be too young.

[00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:39.460]
But I don't think so.

[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:40.700]
Maybe they're like divorced.

[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:42.520]
Or maybe their spouse is dead.

[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:43.700]
Or maybe sensational.

[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:45.560]
Or maybe they don't want one.

[00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:46.680]
Sensational 103.

[00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:48.060]
Hot 92.

[00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:49.660]
Well, we believe you.

[00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:49.940]
Don't we?

[00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:50.580]
No.

[00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:51.780]
I hate this pool.

[00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:52.620]
Oh, Football 9086.

[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:53.880]
A pain to the grade it's

[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:54.160]
69.

[00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:56.940]
I mean, what could come more than that?

[00:51:57.420 --> 00:51:57.680]
It felt an the.

[00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:58.280]
A NEG!

[00:51:58.420 --> 00:51:58.760]
63.

[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:01.980]
Yeah.

[00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:03.260]
Oh, mowing for the.

[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:04.380]
Oh, yeah

[00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:04.580]
It's not waiting for that.

[00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:05.600]
All right.

[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:06.800]
With that opportunity

[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:07.720]
iques you 만guy could talk

[00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:08.280]
through there.

[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:08.680]
Drive Gods.

[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:09.360]
All through it.

[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:11.000]
An groin 53.

[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.240]
Aging badly 48.

[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:13.500]
In other words, when they

[00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:14.640]
You know, in their 20s,

[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:16.420]
They were about for a hot.

[00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:17.960]
They were actually attracted.

[00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:19.840]
It was great.

[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:20.300]
And now oh, god.

[00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:27.740]
Irreplaceable 46, a swab 23, stinky six, and gross only three.

[00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:32.540]
Thank God, only three of them said that their spouse or mate is gross, gross test.

[00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:35.440]
And of course, probably the ones that, you know, had one like that, if they were smart,

[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:36.420]
they dumped it already, right?

[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:37.220]
Right in the river.

[00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:37.740]
They're smart.

[00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:42.800]
John DeBaker, noted today, 125 92 pines, a little more, that's the Home Depot shopping

[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:43.860]
center, pines and flamingo.

[00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:46.640]
Rollie will be there with the Q and P and I think you said Miguel was going to be there.

[00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:48.680]
Maybe they'll both be there.

[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:49.360]
I don't know.

[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:54.820]
But whoever is there is have a limited supply panther parking pass just to give away free

[00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:55.700]
passes to park.

[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:59.280]
Now that whole rip off the old, that rape of the public doesn't start to show to the

[00:52:59.280 --> 00:52:59.640]
life first.

[00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:02.300]
But, you know, what's wrong with having a parking pass?

[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:07.000]
Just another way of sticking to the organization that's trying to stick it to you folks.

[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:08.940]
Oh, it's speaking of our schedule today.

[00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:10.120]
I'm so glad I thought of that.

[00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:13.120]
We were going to have bow on today, but I'm sure somebody thought better of that because

[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:13.920]
it's Tuesday.

[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:17.580]
It means it's the Jacques Martin Spragge show with three to seven known to panther coach,

[00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:18.420]
Jacques Martin.

[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:23.580]
So Geltie's on instead of bull because you know the idea of bull interviewing the panther

[00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:27.540]
coach is I'm sure that Geltie will press the issue of the parking situation.

[00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:29.140]
Not, not.

[00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:31.920]
And of course, it's well, like, that coach has nothing to do with that.

[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:32.900]
He got on the right.

[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:35.100]
Mad Dog 4 to 650.

[00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:35.740]
It's 650.

[00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:37.540]
It's Hurricane's baseball against Fordham.

[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:38.480]
Fordham.

[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:40.440]
Talk about a little girl school.

[00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:42.540]
Any kids in a clock tonight.

[00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:43.640]
Who was the Fordham Flash?

[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:44.580]
Was that Frankie Fish?

[00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:46.360]
Huh?

[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:49.080]
I'm asking, Josh, she's the sportsman, even.

[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:54.640]
Oh, yeah, because I know so much about Fordham and about Frankie Fish who died a hundred

[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:55.020]
years ago.

[00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:57.120]
Look up Google Fordham Flash.

[00:53:58.060 --> 00:53:59.720]
That was the nickname for some great athlete.

[00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:01.660]
I think it was Frankie Fish.

[00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:06.320]
San Diego woman says she was fire-traving in Arizona, bumper sticker.

[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:06.820]
How do you like that?

[00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:08.880]
This is what America is becoming, boys and girls.

[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.620]
Although I do have one good piece of news.

[00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:11.140]
Where is it?

[00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:13.040]
I said the good news.

[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:14.240]
Way in the back of my pile.

[00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:15.360]
People were wondering, oh.

[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:19.760]
Before I do that about the San Diego bitch, Jay Benish.

[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:21.300]
This is Aurora, Colorado.

[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:22.700]
Good news tonight.

[00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:23.200]
Oh.

[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:30.660]
Jay Benish returned to his classroom yesterday morning as Overland High School sought

[00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:33.680]
to return normalcy in the wake of an actual controversy over his teaching methods.

[00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:37.740]
Mr. Benish is a member of our family and essentially welcome back here.

[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:41.180]
Said principal, Jan or Freeler in a brief press conference outside of the school.

[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:43.280]
A type, by the way, happy forum.

[00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:44.180]
Frankie Fish.

[00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:46.960]
What I tell you, Ford and Flash,

[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:49.220]
but why no my crap, my useless trivia or what?

[00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:51.020]
Let's get my Spadilla and hear Play the Little Trivia.

[00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:51.460]
What do you say?

[00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:51.760]
No.

[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:56.380]
A tight ring was kept on members of the media who restricted one spot on the north side

[00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:57.140]
of the school property.

[00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:58.420]
Didn't see Benish enter the building.

[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:02.260]
It was the first day back in class for Benish after being put on paid administrative leave,

[00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:02.720]
March 1.

[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:05.420]
After a tenth graders, 21 minute recording of a Benish lecture,

[00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:07.140]
the way world geography classes made public.

[00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:10.180]
As recording the teacher, little snitch, okay, ought to be shot.

[00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:14.740]
Benish was reinstated Friday after two days of meetings between Benish,

[00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:18.380]
Chirwick Creek School officials, and Benish's attorney, David, don't call me lowest lane.

[00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:22.600]
Benish has been widely criticized for politically charged remarks caught on the recording

[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:23.660]
of a February 1 class.

[00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:27.040]
His comments that they included is drawing a comparison between President Bush and

[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:27.460]
Adolf Hitler.

[00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:28.400]
What's wrong with that?

[00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:30.780]
I've been saying that for about two years now, at least.

[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:35.560]
Freiler yesterday morning said to him, well aware that Benish's geography discussion

[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:38.780]
typically will be on learning the names of Ververs Mountain Rages and Save Capitals.

[00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:40.640]
It's not about maps anymore, if you said.

[00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:41.660]
It's about politics.

[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:42.440]
It's about religions.

[00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:43.200]
It's about culture.

[00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:46.680]
In other words, about real things about life as opposed to where is the say-law

[00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:49.160]
on the map, which had any of them there anymore in our Sri Lanka, man.

[00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:50.220]
It's still a turd.

[00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:55.280]
One of Benish's students, sophomore Chelsea Williams, said she's glad Benish is back in

[00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:55.680]
the classroom.

[00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:57.300]
She doesn't expect to see much change.

[00:55:57.820 --> 00:56:01.240]
He might be a little more cautious now, if you said, who was in the specific class that

[00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:03.100]
been recorded by classmate Sean Allen.

[00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:04.660]
Oh, we're going to get your ass, Sean.

[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.560]
The whole class is going to like corner you and beat you to a bloody pulp.

[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:08.240]
How do you like that?

[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:12.400]
I thought he made it clear he wasn't saying Bush and Hitler were the same person, but

[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:14.040]
I think some students might have got the wrong impression.

[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:14.720]
Yeah.

[00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:16.920]
They're not the same person, they're just similar in their tactics.

[00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:17.440]
That's right.

[00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:19.180]
Although, Hitler was a much better speaker.

[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:20.200]
Right.

[00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:22.460]
More dynamics, more.

[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:24.740]
And he was at least able to speak that language.

[00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:28.660]
The one he was supposed to speak, as opposed to...

[00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:29.720]
Abu Garib.

[00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:33.720]
San Diego woman's statue was fired for having an air-america bumper sticker.

[00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:39.540]
Linda LaRocca has filed suit against her former manager Beverly Fath and her former

[00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:41.840]
company, Advanced Sales and Marketing Inconscendio.

[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:45.420]
It will be because she says she was fired at it because of a bumper sticker.

[00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:51.220]
According to LaRocca, Fath saw her 1360 Air-America Talk Radio bumper sticker and called it,

[00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:54.820]
that Al Franken left her in radical radio station, by the way, Franken in 49 minutes.

[00:56:55.700 --> 00:56:59.100]
LaRocca says, Fath and told her the country is on a state of high alert for all I know

[00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:01.520]
you could be Al Qaeda and fired around the spot.

[00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:06.360]
Because he has an air-america bumper sticker, you could be Al Qaeda.

[00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:09.040]
Should've said we're firing you for having bad taste.

[00:57:09.740 --> 00:57:09.980]
Yeah.

[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:16.320]
California's labor law prohibits employers from controlling or directing their employees'

[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:17.220]
political activities.

[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:20.880]
LaRocca's seeking lost wages and damages done only for violation of the state labor law,

[00:57:21.140 --> 00:57:24.460]
but for wrongful termination, emotional stress and violation of the state constitution.

[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:27.160]
I say like $50 million is easy to this broad.

[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:30.820]
And as far as Beverly Fath is concerned, screw you, honey.

[00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:32.320]
What a joke.

[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:34.560]
Put her in the same category with Joyce.

[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:37.280]
Stick a rubber ball in the mouth, okay?

[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:40.120]
Where's the circle with that rubber ball?

[00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:48.000]
Excuse me, but I do believe that's just egg.

[00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:58.340]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:57:58.340 --> 00:57:58.580]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:57:58.940 --> 00:58:01.140]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:02.060]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:04.380]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:05.440]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:05.600]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:05.900]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:07.520]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:10.160]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:11.160]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:13.100]

[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:13.600]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:16.100]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:17.140]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:19.200]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:20.520]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:20.920]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:21.940]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:22.560]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:23.000]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:23.200]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:26.560]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:27.140]

[00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:31.900]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:32.880]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:32.880]

[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:32.880]

[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:33.320]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:36.020]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:36.480]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:37.100]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:37.140]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:38.720]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:39.880]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:40.880]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:42.660]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:43.560]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:45.880]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:47.160]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:47.520]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:48.300]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:49.160]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:49.160]

[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:49.360]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:51.780]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:51.780]

[00:58:56.520 --> 00:58:57.120]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:04.720]
I think my finish slip poem, you see the way they slow me down.

[00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:06.280]
I think my finish slip poem.

[00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:06.280]

[00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:06.360]
I think my finish slip poem.

[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:06.360]

[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:06.360]

[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:07.560]
If uh well yea i got a bad man right y'know that.

[00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:12.580]
mile i was able to let go it's elevencenten to q and make sure Josh was

[00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:14.540]
olabilir it's like sticking liuzer he was in the bathroom.

[00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:18.240]
you know he been spayingесс lot of time in the bathroom lately

[00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:20.320]
hey I came back lets come on.

[00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:24.220]
You know that was just uh you know what, one of those uh one of those things.

[00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:29.060]
a short break. Paul in LA says a whole bunch of stuff here in Longfanks is

[00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:32.000]
thank you Paul but to go away. Very long and very

[00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:36.020]
ponderous. I bet you we got almost a thousand votes now. Yeah yesterday if you

[00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:38.860]
missed the show Josh Corris was in the teary room for like about a half an hour

[00:59:38.860 --> 00:59:42.140]
there to land a part of the show and we were wondering if he'd ever come back.

[00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:45.240]
But he said he was having a comfortable doose and you know

[00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:50.040]
974 votes. I mean what's more important okay a comfortable dooser taking

[00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:55.500]
here at minutes. I guess he was. It's right. 5 6 7 0 5 6 the pound 5 6

[00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:58.280]
and they've arrived in singular wireless lines only 42 minutes away from

[00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:00.920]
that bigger prince. I thought it was going to be snowing here today but they

[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:04.880]
can't forecast the weather here for crap which is great. You know that last

[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:08.100]
night I got up to like 50 at 60 degrees and then this morning was like 34.

[01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:14.560]
In fact right now it's 32 but the sunny shining and there's no snow so we'll

[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:17.500]
take it. You stay where you are and I'll stay where I am. Okay.

[01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:22.480]
Vanity Fair reports that former Washington Post executive editor Ben Bradley

[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:26.600]
says it's reasonable to assume even though he deny the same as the former State

[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:29.140]
Department of Official Richard Armageddon's likely the source to reveal

[01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:33.420]
say operator Valerie claims name to the post assistant managing editor Bob Woodward.

[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:38.520]
An article to be published in the magazine today in Vanity Fair Bradley is

[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:42.620]
quoted as saying that Armageddon is the likely source to let me say it again

[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:46.140]
that Armageddon is the likely source to say for assumption. Armageddon's with Deputy

[01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:49.760]
Secretary of State and President Bush's first term. In interview yesterday

[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:52.260]
Bradley says he does know the identity of what we're sourcing is not

[01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:56.000]
recall making that precise statement to a Vanity Fair reporter. He said he has no

[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.400]
interest on masking the official. I don't think I said it. He said well he

[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:02.340]
gets to be his aide you know. I know who his sources but I don't want to get

[01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:05.880]
into what I haven't told us so who it is. Bob Vanity Fair says he said it was

[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:09.720]
Richard Armageddon. Who do you believe? I believe Vanity Fair my son.

[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:14.180]
In fact don't we have a bit on the cover of Vanity Fair? Yes we do.

[01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:15.280]
I think it goes.

[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:24.640]
I don't believe it. Just look at that girl. She's a big name beauty who's appeared in movies

[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:31.180]
and you've seen her in the picture show. I saw Ghost Bruce Willis is her hubby and she's got a little

[01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:36.920]
baby that she brings to this studio. Right she makes a whole town and told her

[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:42.840]
how can the clothes not the clothes she doesn't wear. How can the clothes

[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:45.500]
that are painted on the girl is thank you.

[01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:50.300]
I'm a cover of the Vanity Fair. Vanity Fair. Okay that's no.

[01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:57.100]
20 past 11 at 5.60 WQAM. Fine gold. Remember that big

[01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:59.080]
sinister you're going to have a by yesterday with the rest fine gold.

[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:01.740]
Then of course Arlen and then Inspector there tried to like shut them up.

[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:05.520]
Well I want to have a copy of that anyway. He's holding up like here's the copy.

[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:08.320]
Okay set up you idiot. Go find that magic bullet on the stretcher.

[01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:13.280]
Get lost. But the Democrats continue to be spineless like a money lily

[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:15.680]
fashion and it's just your American middle girls.

[01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:18.480]
That little girls would be an insult to little girls.

[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:22.560]
Democrats distance themselves yesterday from Wisconsin Center,

[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:26.280]
Russ Fine gold efforts to censure President Bush over domestic spying.

[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.420]
maneuvering to prevent a vote that could alienate voters.

[01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:31.260]
See that's what it's all about. We don't want to alienate the voters.

[01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:34.740]
Now what's good for the country. Now what makes sense.

[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:37.060]
Now what people responsible people ought to be doing.

[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:38.500]
Oh we don't want alienate voters.

[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:40.940]
When you know something you deserve the crashing that you're getting.

[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:43.560]
The Democrats you deserve exactly what you've got.

[01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:44.640]
Because you suck.

[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:48.280]
Republicans dared Democrats to vote for the proposal.

[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:52.180]
Some Democrats in Congress said they decided the president is the enemy.

[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:53.120]
Vice President stood.

[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:56.620]
Did I Dick Cheney told a Republican audience and fine gold's home state.

[01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:00.920]
Fine gold a potential presidential candidate sit on the Senate floor.

[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:02.120]
The president is violated.

[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:03.720]
A law in Congress must be spined.

[01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:07.920]
A formal censure by Congress is an appropriate and responsible first step to assure the public

[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:10.620]
that when the president thinks he can violate the law without consequences.

[01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:12.820]
Congress has the will to hold him accountable.

[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:14.500]
Even as he spoke.

[01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:17.600]
Democratic leaders maneuvered to hold off the immediate vote that

[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:19.360]
majority leader Bill Fist requested.

[01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:22.200]
Throughout today fine gold's fellow Democrats said they had a

[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:25.220]
citizen's frustration but they held back support for the resolution.

[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:29.080]
Several said they wanted to firstly the Senate and Togans committee finish an

[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:33.460]
investigation to be warmless for having program that pushed authorizes part of his war on terrorism.

[01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:36.700]
I said a news conference whether he'd vote for the central resolution.

[01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:40.320]
Senate minority leader Harry Reid and the Vandida declined to endorse the Senate and read it.

[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:40.660]
Yeah right.

[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:41.980]
But it beat but it boop but it about.

[01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:46.360]
All picking up right where John Kerry left off in 2004.

[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:48.440]
That's a lovely lovely lovely lovely lovely.

[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:49.680]
And then of course is the

[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:51.880]
that one.

[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:55.600]
Senator Jew Lieberman said he hadn't read it either.

[01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:57.440]
Wasn't inclined simply to school the president.

[01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:00.020]
I prefer to see a solve the problem he told reporters.

[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:00.680]
Right.

[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:01.180]
I'm sorry.

[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:03.180]
He said I prefer to see a yeah.

[01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:05.160]
He would be with the wine.

[01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:08.180]
Piece of Dreck God happy.

[01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:10.380]
Purim Jew Lieberman get lost.

[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:15.240]
Nancy Pelosi said she understands fine gold's frustration.

[01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:17.840]
The facts about the NSA domestic surveillance program have been disclosed

[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:19.460]
appropriate to the Congress or office in the statement.

[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:22.220]
Both the House and Senate must fully investigate the program and

[01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:24.180]
assign responsibility for any laws that may have been broken.

[01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:26.440]
And of course it's got quotes.

[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:29.240]
I'm not going to read the resolution because it's a it's a

[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:30.000]
mood point you know.

[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:32.580]
It's like reading the Constitution on here.

[01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:33.120]
What's the point?

[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:35.440]
It's like your president said just a piece of paper.

[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:36.040]
Who cares?

[01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:39.360]
Howard Stern fumes its CBS.

[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:40.460]
You care about this?

[01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:40.800]
No.

[01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:44.520]
Evidently not too many others.

[01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:46.900]
The cause letterman got pounded by Leno last night.

[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:47.940]
That's what Ms. Fodd says.

[01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:49.720]
You know, the well of Parsons.

[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:50.880]
Drudge.

[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:51.540]
Yeah.

[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:53.860]
So I thought that he wanted to be Walter Winshield.

[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:55.460]
But he wants to be the well of Parsons.

[01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:57.040]
And doing a hell of a job lady.

[01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:58.720]
Hey man, do fairy.

[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:01.260]
Radio shock Jack Howard Stern.

[01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:03.680]
And I wonder why they all in all the other.

[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:05.860]
They always had the old executive and then they shocked this.

[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:07.240]
Shock my ass.

[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:08.960]
Know what technicals and said?

[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:10.160]
Something like that.

[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:13.100]
Radio shock Jack Howard Stern is returning.

[01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:17.020]
You know I'm having a since I had that dental work last week.

[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:18.480]
Yeah.

[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:23.060]
I think he like maybe it was having my mouth jammed open for like an hour 20 minutes

[01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:23.460]
straight.

[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:24.760]
Yeah, that'll do it.

[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:28.740]
For like the upper inside or I cheek is like jammed against it.

[01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:30.240]
I've already had the wisdom tooth out up there.

[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:31.460]
It was like on both sides.

[01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:36.020]
And so I'm like talking like thatty duck now until that either heals up up there

[01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:36.480]
or made through.

[01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:38.320]
I'm even going to get that tooth shaved down.

[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:39.740]
I'm going to have to sue that dentist.

[01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:42.060]
Because I never had that problem before.

[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:42.680]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:43.520]
Right.

[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:46.760]
I think it my mouth jammed open in a very unnatural position.

[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:50.480]
Which I know the position my mouth should be in when it's well.

[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:53.800]
Howard Stern resumed his war words with CBS.

[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:54.620]
On CBS.

[01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:57.380]
And guess what website this is on?

[01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:58.600]
Capitol Hill Blue?

[01:05:59.080 --> 01:05:59.280]
No.

[01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:00.000]
CBS?

[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:00.600]
Yes.

[01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:03.200]
Stern who's a...

[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:09.100]
Stern who's in broil in a money million dollar breach of contract lawsuit filed against him by

[01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:12.500]
his ex and floor was back on the Tiffany Network Monday for an appearance last night on the

[01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:13.380]
literature with David Letterman.

[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:15.800]
Stern left CBS and said to move to satellite radio.

[01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:18.000]
Letterman gave Stern a good nature introduction.

[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:22.020]
It's weird not having Howard on the regular radio said Letterman while Stern was still backstage.

[01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:24.780]
It's like having a loved one who passed you who passed away.

[01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:28.600]
You can still sense his presence but you can only contact him to satellite radio.

[01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:31.800]
Oh no wonder I don't want to say a show.

[01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:35.980]
But there were no hearts and flowers and reconciliation was definitely not on the menu.

[01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:38.140]
Stern strode on stage wearing what he called the official.

[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:42.460]
I hate Leslie Moonvese shirt with a photo of Moonvese CBS president and CEO at the Oscars.

[01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:46.640]
Sterners signed with serious satellite radio to escape classes over the off and over the line

[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:47.440]
content of his show.

[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:51.040]
Blasted Moonvese were parting at the Oscars at a time when the network's rated division

[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:53.220]
profits are down in the wake of Stern's exit.

[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:55.100]
Way down. Way way down.

[01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:58.340]
The only problem being that serious and the exam are also of tourists.

[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:01.440]
I did nothing that they did not approve said Stern.

[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:04.800]
Leslie Moonvese has taken a stockholders money and filed a frivolous lawsuit to try to cover

[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:06.040]
what's going on in the radio division.

[01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:08.400]
That's not how CBS saw it.

[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:11.400]
This missing suggestion that there was never to keep Stern off the Letterman show.

[01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:15.340]
We did not stand in the way of Howard appearing on our own airwaves tonight since CBS

[01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:15.860]
in a statement.

[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:19.940]
We believe his appearance was his desperate attempt to distract attention from the facts of the case.

[01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:23.640]
We hope and subsequently coverage of that appearance that the media has not seduced

[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:24.400]
her fooled it anyway.

[01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:28.340]
Howard Stern has done something wrong and we intend to demonstrate this wrongful conduct in court.

[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:30.360]
No, you and people did something wrong.

[01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:32.040]
You left him on the air when he was promoting a series.

[01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:35.740]
You could have taken him off at any point, but you wanted to continue squeezing that sponge

[01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:38.880]
and getting every last dime out of his ass while he was still on your stations.

[01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:40.360]
That's what it's all about CBS.

[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:44.700]
Letterman, though, of course, sucking up tossed in a few kind words for the boss.

[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:48.160]
Pointed to Moonves' record as the man who took the network from third to first place,

[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:52.780]
Letterman said, you cannot acknowledge the... you can't not acknowledge the success that the guys had.

[01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:59.100]
CBS has breached a contract lawsuit against Stern as agent on Buckwald and sees that a real agent.

[01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:03.800]
And Sirius has claimed that in the final months of the network he improperly used CBS

[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:05.620]
radio airwaves to promote his new show on Sirius.

[01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:09.580]
CBS also says Stern discusses plans with Sirius without disclosing them to CBS

[01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:12.800]
as he was contractually required to do and a partridge in a pair of three.

[01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:14.960]
You missed that?

[01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:15.540]
I bet you missed it.

[01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:18.180]
Yeah, I bet you missed this fax somebody just sent over here.

[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:21.080]
About representative Harris, made by a law and a Senate race.

[01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:24.700]
You mean the story that we hit on yesterday?

[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:25.840]
Yeah, that's the one.

[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:26.760]
That's the one again today with an update.

[01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:28.080]
That's the one. That's what we hit all day.

[01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:30.240]
Oh, and you hear about her plane?

[01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:31.080]
What about it?

[01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:32.100]
I heard that.

[01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:34.560]
A Senate patent... oh wait a minute, attorney who gave off limits in photo-wit,

[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:35.640]
no, this is Needs a Lawyer.

[01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:37.720]
Government attorney, I don't know what that means.

[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:39.280]
Do you have any idea what that means?

[01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:39.680]
No.

[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:42.700]
Just in though on CNN, breaking news.

[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:46.320]
Government attorney could be held in criminal contempt good.

[01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:48.340]
At least they don't have what's your name on it from the Pentagon.

[01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:49.760]
That guy who dressed up as a woman.

[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:53.720]
Hey, beach Ford has gone mad speaking enough to crazy people.

[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:57.300]
Madness in March is going on right now and all this month at beach Ford.

[01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:00.280]
They just missed having a record last month so they planned to break that record this month.

[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:02.340]
Right now, I'm spending care of Ford in 450.

[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:07.640]
There was always 249 bucks a month with just $995 downpuss fees for the proprosite in the 39 monthlies.

[01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:10.960]
Madness in March at beach Ford means you must be mad.

[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:11.680]
You've got to be nuts.

[01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:15.640]
Not to take advantage of rebates and discounts up to 10 grand on all new and used vehicles.

[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:18.700]

[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:21.520]

beach Ford will send you 200 bucks in cash just for you sending them by.

[01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:28.620]
Go miss out on this once a year of Aunt Beach Ford's madness in March going on right now.

[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:30.040]
You can't be anywhere.

[01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:33.340]
Extended care for F-150 is the lowest 249 bucks a month.

[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:37.560]
Discounts and rebates up to 10 grand and $200 just for sending via friend.

[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:41.560]
Hurray and Beach Ford is located two miles east of Golden Glaze on 163th

[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:44.700]
being West Exe Highway tell Paul that old Neil sent you by because I guarantee you,

[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:49.240]
it's absolutely beyond a shadow of a doubt that you're going to love your beach Ford experience.

[01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:51.640]
This is Neil Rogers.

[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:55.780]
This is 5.62 AF.

[01:09:58.500 --> 01:09:59.980]
Who's going to get a breaky of hope?

[01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:17.200]
She's a bad city but the land is still a totally freaking out.

[01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:19.720]
We're going with Ray and Spot.

[01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:25.100]
When you smile that's your boy, he feels like in his gut.

[01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:27.360]
But in your last year,

[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:31.420]
till she had your happy Lincoln her past.

[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:35.240]
Oh my god, she's not gonna be.

[01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:36.240]
She's not gonna be.

[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:38.020]
She's been feeling fine.

[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:40.660]
She's feeling she can't drop.

[01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:45.920]
It doesn't matter if you're handsome or a big fat fly.

[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:48.020]
She's just my election.

[01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:52.120]
The last thing you know you're giving your wife to.

[01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:53.920]
I can't get some apples.

[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:56.160]
I'm an angelina Jolie.

[01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:56.760]
No.

[01:10:57.180 --> 01:10:58.680]
Oh, here she comes.

[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:01.960]
And you need not want your guy.

[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:03.920]
Oh, here she comes.

[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:07.000]
She's a bad city and a bad city.

[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:09.280]
Oh, here she comes.

[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.240]
Kissing off the other way.

[01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:14.180]
Oh, here she comes.

[01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:17.260]
She's a bad city and a bad city.

[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:22.100]
Oh, did I mention prosecutors to say that the 14-year-old boy

[01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:24.460]
who was beaten and kicked by guards in a juvenile boot camp

[01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:27.340]
did not die of a blood disorder as a medical examiner initially ruled.

[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:28.740]
And of course they got the video tape.

[01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:29.880]
Let's go to the video tape.

[01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:31.000]
Okay, here it is.

[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:32.980]
And they beat the crap out of him and he died.

[01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:36.560]
So all that crap about O's sickle cell and it was in an AKL right.

[01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:39.880]
Even the right-wing New York Post remember the article I had yesterday

[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:42.100]
about Secretary of Hays here is Michael Levitt?

[01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:42.480]
Yes.

[01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:44.260]
About the tuna and powdered milk.

[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:48.960]
Even Rupert Murdoch's extremely right-wing New York Post is making part of that.

[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:50.760]
They got an online article today.

[01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:53.580]
It's a headline says fishy bird-thru advice.

[01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:57.160]
With the picture of Michael Levitt under it says stock up on tuna.

[01:11:58.360 --> 01:11:59.660]
Uncle Sam is advising.

[01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:01.960]
Oh God.

[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:06.520]
Uncle Sam is advising people to store canned tuna and powdered milk under their beds.

[01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:08.900]
To be ready for an avion flu outbreak.

[01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:12.240]
What we're talking about here is preparedness and preparedness saves lives,

[01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:16.240]
Secretary of HHS Michael Levitt, who made the recommendation over the weekend in Chian

[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:16.620]
and Wyoming.

[01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:19.960]
Adgressingly, Wyoming pandemic clues some it.

[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:23.920]
The nation's health chief said, when you go to the store and buy three cans of tuna fish

[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:25.440]
by a fourth and put it under the bed.

[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:29.240]
When you go to the store to buy milk by powdered milk and put that under the bed.

[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:33.000]
Levitt also said people should try to accumulate up to a six-week supply of food,

[01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:34.140]
water, medicine, and other essentials.

[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:36.800]
Preparations should be no different than for a two-week blizzard.

[01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:38.920]
It's just a good idea, he said.

[01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:39.980]
It's called self-reliance.

[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:44.740]
His advice recalls a February 2003 recommendation from ex-Holman Security Secretary Tom Ridge

[01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:49.140]
by duct tape to seal off your home in the event of a chemical or biological strike.

[01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:50.360]
Don't forget the green.

[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:54.780]
The recommendation sparked a run on duct tape or was rescinded a week after

[01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:58.500]
a critic such as Mayor Bloomberg called it preposterous.

[01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:02.120]
But, apostorous, I'm just saying with the censor ridiculous ludicrous,

[01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:06.860]
keep everybody on edge, baby, keep them peeing in their pants because it's all about safety,

[01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:08.120]
safety, safety.

[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:11.620]
So what if the Arabs are running the ports?

[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:12.280]
Who the hell cares?

[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:14.700]
And by the way, I have some bad news on that too.

[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:15.840]
Do you?

[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:19.700]
Where's that story about the Dubai folks?

[01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:22.800]
By the way, Oprah, you're going to do that show in the Dubai command opera.

[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:24.660]
We have sell out.

[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:25.780]
Wouldn't be the first time.

[01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:31.160]
The Dubai owned company that promised to surrender its US port operations has no immediate plans

[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:34.720]
to sell its US subsidiaries interested in Miami's report.

[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:38.340]
I've seen an executive wrote yesterday in a private email to business associates.

[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:42.140]
Even if DP World War II sell its Miami operations to quell the congressional

[01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:44.640]
fuel over an airborne to company management in the US ports,

[01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:47.300]
that would probably take a while, wrote Robert Scavone,

[01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:49.880]
a vice president for DP World's US subsidiary.

[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:54.420]
The email obtained by the AP added to questions raised since DP World's announcement last week

[01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:58.440]
that will divest US port operations required when it bought London-based peninsula and Oriental

[01:13:58.440 --> 01:13:59.720]
steam navigation company.

[01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:03.480]
DP World has said those operations are worth roughly 700 million bucks.

[01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:07.180]
The takeover touched off a political uproar over the Bush administration's earlier approval

[01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:09.880]
of the deal without an intensive 40-day security investigation.

[01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:13.040]
The company initially sought to acquire it to dispute by submitting voluntarily to such

[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:16.120]
investigation last week DP World backed away from the deal further.

[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:20.260]
It pledged to transfer fully its US operations to an unspecified American company

[01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:22.880]
and said DP World will suffer no economic loss.

[01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:27.580]
The company is steadfastly declined to clarify a statement or the timing of any possible sale.

[01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:30.840]
Meeting congressional critics have threatened to intervene if DP World's

[01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:33.520]
plans fall short of a full divestiture of its US operations.

[01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:37.340]
Scavone told AP an interview that his email was intended to reassure officials

[01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:41.240]
that the port of Miami-Terminal operating company, which manages operations there and is

[01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:44.760]
owned by DP World subsidiary, that uncertainty surrounding the Dubai port

[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:46.760]
deal would not affect its work in Miami.

[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:54.760]
All right, now that we should care about such matters, okay?

[01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:56.320]
Why not let the air be run a whole thing?

[01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:57.560]
I think it's racist.

[01:14:58.140 --> 01:14:59.400]
It's Islam of the...

[01:14:59.400 --> 01:14:59.960]
Yeah, there you go.

[01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:03.380]
If we don't want to let them, it's just because there are a bunch of terrorists out there.

[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:06.180]
I mean, the whole thing is so idiotic on the face of it.

[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:07.940]
Got all these footprints.

[01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:10.780]
You know, and of course there was due librem and basically saying the same thing.

[01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:12.740]
You see him stand up there and say,

[01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:13.480]
Oh, here he is.

[01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:17.040]
Don't want to send our air friends and don't want to piss off the Earth's street.

[01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:21.800]
Him and Susan Collins, although at least he's usually lately on the right side of issues,

[01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:23.100]
but she's still whining and annoying.

[01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:26.580]
But he's on a whining and annoying on the wrong side of every issue, due librem.

[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:29.520]
I hope he chokes on his humontos, you know, he like that.

[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:32.920]
He has probably eaten him little stale kind, a little bricks.

[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:35.720]
10-10 wins New York.

[01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:36.800]
I mean, 10-10 votes.

[01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:37.520]
Look at that.

[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:38.740]
It's only a little after 7-30.

[01:15:39.460 --> 01:15:41.940]
Yeah, we're going to care package from Dave Halverson already.

[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:43.060]
I beg your pardon?

[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:44.800]
He always sends something on porno.

[01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:46.240]
But he knows I'm not there.

[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:48.980]
He doesn't want to send humontosons to go in.

[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:50.440]
He sends it anyway and I do eat it.

[01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:53.280]
Well, you better get there today.

[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:54.660]
I guess he forgot about you.

[01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:59.360]
But as far as Josh is concerned, he don't need to be eating any more free food.

[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:02.680]
We're making too many trips to the tea room these last couple of days.

[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:04.920]
What is all about at the free food now?

[01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:06.420]
I don't think they're really annoying.

[01:16:06.420 --> 01:16:07.900]
This thing around the room.

[01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:09.760]
Yeah, I think I'm going to sue this dentist.

[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:13.040]
Remember I raved about how good he was?

[01:16:13.260 --> 01:16:13.800]
Yes, he did.

[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:15.800]
I think either way he's got to like,

[01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:19.200]
chop down the side of that tooth up there.

[01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:20.320]
It's like cutting into my cheek.

[01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:20.780]
Oh, no.

[01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:21.760]
You ever heard that?

[01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:22.820]
Yeah.

[01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:23.840]
You have?

[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:27.160]
Well, I mean, everyone wants to take a bite out of your cheek and you're...

[01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:28.440]
Well, I'm not talking about biting the cheek.

[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:31.180]
I'm talking as I'm talking, it's like cutting into the...

[01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:33.100]
Oh, that part of the cheek there and everything that before.

[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:35.820]
I think he's got my mouth all sideways now.

[01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:36.820]
Uh-oh.

[01:16:37.220 --> 01:16:39.320]
I think my bicuspids are where my mole was used to be.

[01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:40.800]
I don't even know what bicuspids are.

[01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:41.740]
Ask, uh, what's his name?

[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:42.380]
Brian Williams there.

[01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:42.920]
He's got a love teeth.

[01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:44.480]
Okay, little tiny ones.

[01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:47.780]
Pakistan weekly spills 9-11 beans.

[01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:49.060]
Oh, God.

[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:50.720]
Maybe that's what smells so bad.

[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:52.580]
Someone in Paki, guys.

[01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:57.680]
The Pakistan Ford office had paid tens of thousands of dollars to lobbyists in the U.S.

[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:02.020]
to get anti-Pakistan references dropped from the 9-11 inquiry commission report

[01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:03.640]
that Friday times is claimed.

[01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:06.880]
Where's that newspaper in Calcutta, India?

[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.340]
What are they hating southern like poison?

[01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:09.820]
They had it.

[01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:11.220]
Like poison.

[01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:15.820]
The Pakistan-E Weekly Senate story is based on disclosures made by foreign service officials

[01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:18.960]
to the Public Accounts Committee, the secret meeting in Islamabad on Tuesday.

[01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:23.280]
It claimed that some of the commission members were also bribed to prevent them from

[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:25.240]
including damaging information about Pakistan.

[01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:29.160]
The magazine said the PAK revealed officials in the presence of foreign secretary,

[01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:30.180]
Rias Mohamed Khan.

[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:31.400]
See, they all got the same names.

[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:35.700]
And special secretary, Shere Afghan, on the money paid to lobbyists.

[01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:36.820]
They were hounding him.

[01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:41.280]
The disclosure sheds doubt on the integrity, the members of the 9-11 inquiry commission

[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:43.760]
and above all, the authenticity of the information on their final report.

[01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:47.160]
It said the report quoted an officer saying that dramatic changes were made in the final

[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:49.580]
draft for the inquiry commission after lobbyists got to work.

[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:53.920]
The panel was formed in probably 9-11 terror attack and made suggestions to fight terrorism.

[01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:58.320]
After the commission tipped lobbyists about the damaging revelations on Pakistan's rule in 9-11,

[01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:01.420]
they contacted the panel members, asked them to go soft on the country.

[01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:05.120]
The Friday Times claims a lot of money was used to silence these members.

[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:07.400]
Oh, there's nothing like a silent member.

[01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:12.640]
Accordingly, reports lobbyists also have Pakistan win the Assembly of 75 U.S. Congressman,

[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:15.040]
as part of its strategy to guard Islamabad's interest in Washington.

[01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:21.320]
U.S. softened toward Pakistan only because of the efforts of the foreign office,

[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:22.760]
an official was quoted saying in the report.

[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.740]
The Pakistan Foreign Office, dependent on the decision of hired lobbyists,

[01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:28.840]
saying it was an established practice in the U.S.A.

[01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:33.660]
Lobbyists, man, just like Bob Dola knows the schmathads from the UAEA.

[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:38.420]
And I'm sure about the Islamabad meeting said money could play an important role in buying

[01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:42.380]
powerful people. The remark came in response to comments made by some U.S. officials after

[01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:45.180]
9-11 that Pakistanis will sell their mothers for a dollar.

[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.880]
Right, I won't give you a fiddiescent.

[01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:53.560]
Pakistan had emerged as a frontrunner in the fight against terrorism,

[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:55.520]
at least by the U.S. after the terrorist attacks,

[01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:59.260]
Washington published billions of dollars to win President Pervesma's share of support

[01:18:59.260 --> 01:19:03.200]
and launching a crackdown. I'll try to never thrive on a Pakistan-Afghanistan border.

[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:06.680]
And of course, I give it all the nukes from Angos to India just a few days ago.

[01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:08.660]
Prove they were wasting all their money.

[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:10.660]
How are those Angos? I haven't gotten money yet.

[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:12.200]
I don't know. I know that the U.S.

[01:19:12.340 --> 01:19:13.300]
were talking noodles are pretty good.

[01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:17.540]
That was amazing. That was fabulous.

[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:21.060]
I mean, it was only one guy. It's not like we had a flood of people.

[01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:24.180]
If you were going around asking people, what about the insure talking noodles?

[01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:25.120]
They'd look like, hey, why?

[01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:26.560]
What do you say?

[01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:28.020]
Enjoy your suggestion, you say that.

[01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:31.020]
You probably put that red apple in your mouth.

[01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:35.620]
My spouse or a significant other is

[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:41.840]
2015 votes. A treasure 190. Don't have one 185.

[01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:43.580]
Sensational 109.

[01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:47.560]
As in PT 109.

[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:52.100]
Hot 95. Don't we own that station? Hot 95.

[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:53.400]
I think it was INZO. We don't.

[01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:57.700]
I hate this pool 91. A pain but greatness acts 76.

[01:19:58.080 --> 01:19:59.240]
A nag 68.

[01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:03.180]
Annoying 61.

[01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:06.080]
Irreplaceable 57 and you were laughing at that guy.

[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:07.720]
And I was too.

[01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:09.680]
Aging badly 48.

[01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:10.920]
A slog 26.

[01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:12.140]
Stinky 6.

[01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:13.620]
Fae and Gross.

[01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:14.880]
Sultimatate trace.

[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:18.280]
And Scott.

[01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:20.820]
Missed 6562.

[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:21.380]
A.

[01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:26.700]
Our David's a bitch.

[01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:27.080]
Oh,

[01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:28.520]
the door.

[01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:28.940]
The door.

[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:30.080]
The door.

[01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:31.720]
The door.

[01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:33.000]
The door.

[01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:34.460]
The door.

[01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:34.820]
The door.

[01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:36.220]

[01:20:36.460 --> 01:20:37.040]
The door.

[01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:38.280]
The hat.

[01:20:38.620 --> 01:20:39.260]
And all the wood.

[01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:40.060]
That's really Saturday.

[01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:42.360]
He's got a lot of noise to talk about.

[01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:43.740]
He's got a lot of noise to talk about.

[01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:44.540]
I don't give a crap.

[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:46.040]
What's that very has to say?

[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:47.800]
You see what's that close to?

[01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:48.300]
Things to guys.

[01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:49.500]
That's what I'm doing.

[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:51.400]
I'll have you know.

[01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:52.920]
I know what I'm talking about.

[01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:54.600]
I'm remodeling at the condo.

[01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:55.720]
I take the elevator down.

[01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:58.600]
And on my way to the car when I pull my clothing basket out,

[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:00.000]
I give a three condo.

[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:00.560]
Face it.

[01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:02.080]
The door.

[01:21:02.260 --> 01:21:03.240]
He's a back and towel.

[01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:03.640]
The door.

[01:21:07.220 --> 01:21:09.140]
The back and towel.

[01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:10.240]
The door.

[01:21:10.580 --> 01:21:11.020]
The door.

[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:11.540]
The door.

[01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:12.100]
The back and towel.

[01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:12.400]
The door.

[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:13.200]
The door.

[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:13.840]
The door.

[01:21:14.060 --> 01:21:14.140]
The door.

[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:15.400]
The door.

[01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:15.540]
The door.

[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:16.840]
The door.

[01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:19.860]
The door.

[01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:20.300]
The door.

[01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:21.220]
The door.

[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:27.400]
The door.

[01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:30.200]
I said the door.

[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:31.260]
The back and towel.

[01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:32.480]
Why you.

[01:21:33.820 --> 01:21:36.620]
I got a whole new sport old food.

[01:21:37.340 --> 01:21:39.480]
I know everything that's going on in bad rules.

[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:42.700]
Why I even know all the new mud on rules.

[01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:44.080]
I beg to the judge.

[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:44.220]
I beg to the judge.

[01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:48.320]
You guys are going back to life.

[01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:51.240]
You said that is true when I take your place.

[01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:53.960]
I know I ain't no way of playing me.

[01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:56.420]
But when they drop my voice, we'll change.

[01:21:56.600 --> 01:21:57.980]
You little smoothies in the cold.

[01:21:58.840 --> 01:21:59.460]
I'm just going to go.

[01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:02.440]
I'm just going to go.

[01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:05.380]
I'm just going to go.

[01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:08.360]
I'm just going to go.

[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:09.100]
I'm just going to go.

[01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:11.700]
I'm just going to go.

[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:13.300]
I'm just going to go.

[01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:16.900]
Speaking of two o'clock this afternoon, we got Geldy Tudafoe,

[01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:19.180]
because we can't make a butter mine who we want no more.

[01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:23.340]
That's just the, it's even to be a source of such an embarrassment and humiliation.

[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:26.220]
I mean, it's the 14th of March for Christ's sakes.

[01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:30.360]
Anyway, Geldy Tudafoe was dropped Martinly a froggy coach of your panthers of three,

[01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:33.020]
and he'll give you all sorts of answers and alibis.

[01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:34.880]
We're going to make the playoffs. We're going to make the playoffs.

[01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:37.160]
Mad Dog, four to six 50.

[01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:38.700]
Hurricane's baseball against Fordham.

[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.180]
Frankie first to Fordham Flash, six 50.

[01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:42.900]
He's playing tonight and then 80k at 10.

[01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:45.420]
Yeah, by the way, Rollie's already out there.

[01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:46.000]
It's John the Baker.

[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:48.100]
Well, how do you like that?

[01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:50.200]
The early bird gets the worm.

[01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:51.240]
That's true.

[01:22:51.340 --> 01:22:52.100]
And that's what they're giving him.

[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:55.720]
Rollie is at John the Baker right now until to this afternoon.

[01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:57.700]
He's the early bird you toured.

[01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:02.860]
That's at 125.92 pounds of bull or other John the Baker location in Home Depot Shopping Center,

[01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:03.640]
Pines of Lomingo.

[01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:06.560]
He's got the QAM best of...

[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:07.040]
Ferdinand.

[01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:07.400]
Stuff.

[01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:08.740]
CDs and T-shirts.

[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:13.520]
And he has a limited supply to get their early of Panthers parking passes,

[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:19.700]
which is our way of protesting against this grotesque, this outrageous rape of the...

[01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:23.140]
Not going to Panthers fans, but anybody else who's going to the Macarena to attend a concert,

[01:23:23.620 --> 01:23:26.640]
a curling match, whatever they're going there for, you know.

[01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:29.520]
Just once again, sticking it to the public.

[01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:30.400]
Stick it, stick it.

[01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:33.120]
It's not bad enough that they soak in those ridiculous prices for the tickets.

[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:36.320]
That's not bad enough for what's usually like a minor league team.

[01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:37.280]
That's not bad enough.

[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:40.280]
And they're not bad enough that they're overcharging for the really mediocre concessions.

[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:42.500]
The food that my dogs wouldn't have eaten.

[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.040]
No, that's not bad enough.

[01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:49.260]
If it's not, you know, I just refuse to show for that organization.

[01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:53.080]
I mean, it's pointless because all the years that that thing has been around,

[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:55.500]
and it's basically a massive failure, okay?

[01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:58.640]
And it's always well, you know, look at this and they're re-signed,

[01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:00.400]
you open in, and they're like right on the verge,

[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:02.480]
and they're only like 11 points B-I-F.

[01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:04.060]
11 points behind my ass.

[01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:07.220]
You got a better chance to make an apply off the Navy.

[01:24:07.820 --> 01:24:08.800]
How do you like that?

[01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:10.260]
George.

[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:10.900]
Oh, good.

[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:12.060]
I'm there.

[01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:14.560]
I can't believe I have the same guy from LA that facts before.

[01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:15.780]
There's this desperate for me to read.

[01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:16.800]
Well, this is kind of interesting.

[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:20.080]
Check out the article from the LA Times entitled,

[01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:21.340]
Cable's Fall From Grace.

[01:24:22.900 --> 01:24:26.460]
Now, the only interesting part is this is the article also tells the truth

[01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:28.600]
about Nancy Grace's story of being in alleged crime victim.

[01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:30.160]
On that issue, the article reads,

[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:33.640]
this week the New York Observer reported that Grace is frequently repeated

[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:35.700]
to counter the tragedy that made her a crime victim

[01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:37.520]
doesn't quite comport with the facts.

[01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:39.740]
Her version of the event in Sligalaptimath,

[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:42.640]
notwithstanding it turns out that Grace's fiance Keith Griffin

[01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:45.160]
was not the victim of random robbery murder,

[01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:47.780]
but instead was killed by a mildly retarded former co-worker

[01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:49.500]
that scrambled over his recent firing.

[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:51.600]
When it comes to Grace's record,

[01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:53.980]
his Fulton County prosecutor, CNN headlined,

[01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:56.820]
chooses to overlook the fact that since she became a broadcaster,

[01:24:57.240 --> 01:24:59.320]
a federal appeals court and the Georgia Supreme Court

[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:01.600]
have overturned three of the conditions she obtained as DA,

[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:04.580]
and in each instance stated her unethical conduct.

[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:05.500]
How do you like that?

[01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:06.160]
Oh my God!

[01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:07.340]
Grace, my ass!

[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:08.440]
God is she annoying.

[01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:09.780]
Yes, and an unethical hair.

[01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:11.200]
Oh, geez.

[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:13.640]
Okay, Fran, well thank you, Fran.

[01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:17.980]
It's folny as a 46-and-a-half-dollar bill. Good God.

[01:25:18.860 --> 01:25:20.820]
And this is what television is.

[01:25:20.820 --> 01:25:24.640]
Television is the evil, forget about Iran, Iraq, North Korea.

[01:25:25.140 --> 01:25:27.460]
Television is the most evil force in the world.

[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:31.540]
Now how would Beel set, and he wouldn't have set it?

[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:35.980]
Who knows what kind of crap will be peddling for truth on television?

[01:25:36.180 --> 01:25:36.520]
And that's right.

[01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:38.020]
That's what they peddle crap.

[01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:40.700]
And there's that wolf blitzkrieg, man,

[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:42.700]
with his hip boots all the way up to his name, Ass.

[01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:46.220]
And yeah, I like to fact that Jack can't,

[01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:48.400]
no matter what he says, Jack can't really just blows him off.

[01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:49.980]
You know, he just continues rambling and rambling.

[01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:52.080]
I like Jack can't really layly.

[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:54.820]
I think he was in the same class that Lou Dodd's got.

[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:55.320]
He went together.

[01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:56.840]
They got the same bug.

[01:25:57.140 --> 01:25:58.780]
Because they generally tended to be pretty much,

[01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:00.380]
you know, suck ups for the right wing.

[01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:03.820]
But now all of a sudden they both in the last few weeks are like rip and ass.

[01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:08.340]
And he was making fun, Jack can't really yesterday,

[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:10.640]
about that whole bird-thoof thing in the milk,

[01:26:10.780 --> 01:26:14.540]
and the powdered milk under the bed, and a tuna, and what a joke.

[01:26:14.860 --> 01:26:17.940]
And the wolf blitzkrieg stands in with a straight face and says,

[01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:21.820]
well, Jack, or the possibility of a worldwide pandemic

[01:26:21.820 --> 01:26:24.620]
that couldn't pay a man, and can't really just bloom right off.

[01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:27.460]
The most vorish Jack ass that was hit by television,

[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:29.500]
wolf blitzkrieg, I hope they drag your ass off.

[01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:31.000]
They need the middle of a news case, you idiot.

[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:33.660]
I hope the liberals come in there and take over CNN.

[01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:34.880]
Take your hostage.

[01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:37.060]
God, what a joke.

[01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:40.040]
Especially the Dan of Bash and the Dan Kira Phillips,

[01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:40.680]
the two of them.

[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:43.920]
The El Antichristi, two of them.

[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:47.240]
See, who said it was only going to be one antichrist, right?

[01:26:48.100 --> 01:26:49.380]
Could there be several antichrists?

[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:50.580]
Let me check.

[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:51.120]
I'll look it up.

[01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:53.460]
Here's an update on the good news from Iraq, because there isn't any.

[01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:54.560]
Oh, we're fine.

[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:56.640]
Well, can you believe that Dan Stewart is dead?

[01:26:57.860 --> 01:26:58.940]
That's good, yeah.

[01:26:59.180 --> 01:26:59.340]
Kookie.

[01:26:59.540 --> 01:26:59.840]
Shocking.

[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.220]
A lot younger than we are.

[01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:05.200]
How old were you to say he would have been at the, about 40?

[01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:06.200]
40 something.

[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:07.580]
He was just a couple years older than me.

[01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:09.400]
He was older than you are?

[01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:10.020]
Yeah.

[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.220]
No, even older than I am.

[01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:12.980]
Nobody's older than me.

[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:14.600]
Except in South Florida.

[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:17.060]
Police found the bodies are at least 85.

[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:19.640]
Now, every hour of the story continues going up and up and up.

[01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:20.120]
And up and up.

[01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:21.040]
The numbers keep going up and up.

[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:23.860]
Only we wish our numbers could keep going up like that.

[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:25.140]
That's what they're saying across the street.

[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:29.340]
Where they got the intellectual OJ Juus McDuffie show going on.

[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:31.080]
And then Sid the Kid Rosenberg.

[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:32.440]
I wonder if he's still around.

[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:38.320]
Police found the bodies of at least 85 people killed by execution style shootings in the past 24 hours.

[01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:42.880]
A gruesome wave of appearance, sectarian reprisal slangs, official said today.

[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:45.900]
Did you get that sectarian reprisal slangs?

[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:46.540]
What is that?

[01:27:46.660 --> 01:27:47.700]
It's a civil war, baby.

[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:50.980]
And just like the article said the other day, it's always been a civil war.

[01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:51.580]
It's nothing new.

[01:27:51.580 --> 01:27:54.160]
This is just that Sodom had them under wraps.

[01:27:55.500 --> 01:28:00.820]
It did include at least 27 bodies stacked in a mass grave in the Eastern Shiite neighborhood of Baghdad.

[01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:02.140]
Ah, Shiite, man.

[01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:03.520]
Wow, just don't stop.

[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:05.940]
How are we doing to join the Baker?

[01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:06.720]
We're going to get a room out.

[01:28:06.900 --> 01:28:08.080]
I bet you we get a report at noon.

[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:10.940]
Bet you did.

[01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:11.900]
Next break.

[01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:12.540]
Do you think, Josh?

[01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:13.540]
I would think so, yeah.

[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:13.900]
Yeah.

[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:15.680]
Goose that thing up.

[01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:18.840]
We can get up to like 20 grand today if we really get a big crowd there at John the Baker.

[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:22.580]
But when you get some of that great food, buy yourself a nice meal.

[01:28:22.580 --> 01:28:24.840]
I give you a bunch of them garlic rolls just for mentioning my name.

[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:26.660]
Garlic rolls as big as con bow campers head.

[01:28:27.580 --> 01:28:27.900]
Man.

[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:32.460]
But most importantly, I'll get your free pants or parking passes after you give us your money.

[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:36.000]
And by the way, ours is tax deductibles for a pant and a pair rescue.

[01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:38.620]
I just mentioned that in passing, too.

[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:44.620]
As opposed to that big brother big sister routine at the panthers you're doing, you're full of it, okay?

[01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:48.820]
Everybody that comes in here, everybody that walks on your lot wants a certify.

[01:28:50.340 --> 01:28:54.460]
Receipt signed by Alan Cohen and his brother Marty.

[01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:55.680]
How do you like them apples?

[01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:00.600]
Oh, I think that people are like, if they're going to pull that crap, I think people are going to say that all the way.

[01:29:00.740 --> 01:29:01.240]
Don't even go.

[01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:01.660]
Right.

[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:03.000]
I'm not going to anymore.

[01:29:03.260 --> 01:29:03.260]

[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:09.160]
In fact, I'm looking to see, well, although even though they're not doing it yet, I think it's a protest to nip it in the bud so they don't do it.

[01:29:09.340 --> 01:29:09.900]
Just don't go.

[01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:13.660]
Refuse to park, refuse to pay, refuse to allude.

[01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:14.820]
That's my suggestion.

[01:29:15.220 --> 01:29:18.800]
Refuse to get ripped off by an organization that's given you such a service for.

[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:23.840]
All these years, I guarantee you one thing was a hell of a lot more fun even though they weren't, you know, they had that one big year,

[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:26.620]
but back in the Miami arena, those were the days, that was a lot of fun.

[01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:29.020]
Different crowd, different ambiance.

[01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:31.780]
Yeah, so they were losing a lot of money, but we can't afford it.

[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:33.160]
It was fun.

[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:34.160]
Never missed a home game.

[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:38.440]
But in the new joint there like I could walk from my house to do, you know that.

[01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:40.720]
Yeah, a little bit of a hike, but I could do it.

[01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:45.100]
I wouldn't go to those games if they paid me $100 to come in the door.

[01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:47.760]
Maybe a thousand and immediately head over to the Indians.

[01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:50.920]
Speaking of popping a park, what's going on in July?

[01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:52.620]
We got to wait until we get those slots going.

[01:29:53.860 --> 01:29:54.620]
He told me, huh?

[01:29:55.340 --> 01:29:55.600]
I don't know.

[01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:56.440]
Let's get with it.

[01:29:56.620 --> 01:29:57.860]
Let's get the ball going.

[01:29:58.100 --> 01:29:58.940]
Let's get a rolling baby.

[01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:00.560]
Let's get the thing on the road.

[01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:03.260]
You like it, the slots for the roll.

[01:30:03.340 --> 01:30:04.800]
Then I might actually show up once in a while there.

[01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:06.120]
100 of my guts out.

[01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:07.780]
Can you imagine the beast once they start that?

[01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:09.340]
Oh boy.

[01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:10.920]
In fact, forget about him.

[01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:11.560]
What about daddy?

[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:12.360]
He's going to be broke.

[01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:14.860]
This is Neil Rogers.

[01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:16.300]
Sorry, my beast.

[01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:18.780]
He's 5.62.8.

[01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:20.780]
This is Mark Morgan.

[01:30:21.180 --> 01:30:23.680]
It's the 12 to 1 hour on QAM.

[01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:29.860]
Well, I never thought I'd find the guy no ride that I'd been doing the round bit today.

[01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:35.700]
Now it's a classic set of wheels mixed up for when your rubber would die again.

[01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:42.340]
Now it'd be the time that the drink is cold and it does not the bossy type of thing.

[01:30:42.340 --> 01:30:44.300]
It doesn't get a liquid cherry yolk.

[01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:46.180]
Oh baby.

[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:50.680]
What could that good ought to cherry cherry be baby?

[01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:53.020]
Oh baby.

[01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:55.440]
Shiny little building.

[01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:56.720]
Very fishy.

[01:30:57.020 --> 01:30:58.180]
It's a big kid.

[01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:00.120]
Now it's the one down south of the road.

[01:31:00.460 --> 01:31:02.500]
It's a big status soup of that way.

[01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:06.240]
Now with the harvest stock, the big deal is a big deal.

[01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:09.780]
So they'll get around the picture for greats.

[01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:13.460]
I got 79 on both Catalina.

[01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:15.380]
She's gonna confide now.

[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:17.040]
It's my baby, Cadillac.

[01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:18.860]
Tall baby.

[01:31:20.060 --> 01:31:22.720]
Cooler than her daughter, cherry cherry.

[01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:25.580]
It's a tall baby.

[01:31:26.660 --> 01:31:28.280]
Shiny little building.

[01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:29.200]
Very fishy.

[01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:30.040]
Go.

[01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:42.180]
Go.

[01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:43.520]
Go.

[01:31:47.060 --> 01:31:47.700]
Go.

[01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:50.620]
Go.

[01:31:50.620 --> 01:31:50.620]

[01:31:50.620 --> 01:31:50.620]

[01:31:50.620 --> 01:31:50.620]

[01:31:50.620 --> 01:31:50.620]

[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:50.640]

[01:31:50.700 --> 01:31:50.940]
Go.

[01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:50.940]

[01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:50.940]

[01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:50.940]

[01:31:53.340 --> 01:31:53.340]

[01:31:53.340 --> 01:31:53.600]
Go.

[01:31:55.500 --> 01:32:01.400]
I grab my wind those down on our hearts on the day because they're nacing down with no wind.

[01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:07.300]
The sweaty pressure of our seeds comes besweil against the tossing water in the first time.

[01:32:08.900 --> 01:32:10.620]
I'm not that big of a mind.

[01:32:10.740 --> 01:32:12.380]
The shiny ground is no like lies.

[01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:13.880]
That's my coffee churned juice.

[01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:15.960]
I've been washing it with all the road.

[01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:17.840]
Tall baby.

[01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:21.380]
Cooler than her daughter, cherry cherry.

[01:32:21.820 --> 01:32:22.420]
It's a big deal.

[01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:24.620]
Tall baby.

[01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:29.280]
Michael's shopping crew's going over to speed folks saying from school.

[01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:30.980]
Tall baby.

[01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:35.480]
First of all, it's a very big fancy to be baby.

[01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:37.680]
Tall baby.

[01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:38.960]
Crazy.

[01:32:40.780 --> 01:32:42.900]
Okay, trouble one at 560 WQ.

[01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:47.440]
I'm happy Tuesday today and our total is zero right now.

[01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:48.400]
We moved by that.

[01:32:48.900 --> 01:32:49.920]
We got nothing right now.

[01:32:51.220 --> 01:32:52.980]
No, you didn't get a call or you got a call.

[01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:56.300]
I got a call but a call for no money.

[01:32:57.080 --> 01:32:58.080]
We have no money.

[01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:00.040]
We got not already done now.

[01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:01.280]
And John the Baker?

[01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:07.060]
I mean, granted, it was as a voice to start till noon.

[01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:11.620]
People are going to magically show up there just because it's 12 minutes.

[01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:13.540]
Oh, Raleigh is zero already.

[01:33:13.700 --> 01:33:17.080]
We're going to transport themselves like Mr. Spock.

[01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:20.220]
Yeah, that's exactly what we expected.

[01:33:20.780 --> 01:33:22.400]
Rubbed their ears and all of a sudden they would show up there.

[01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:24.400]
You better get there between now and two.

[01:33:24.460 --> 01:33:25.600]
We're going to be pretty porked off.

[01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:28.380]
Maybe they're saving the money that we're going to give us.

[01:33:28.380 --> 01:33:31.500]
And they're going to use it for their parking roll for their own parking privileges.

[01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:32.680]
Say that charity girl.

[01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:34.620]
I can't stop thinking about how stupid that is.

[01:33:34.780 --> 01:33:36.120]
It's just it's just not in the face.

[01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:39.020]
It's unbelievable because when I told you about it, you didn't believe it.

[01:33:39.220 --> 01:33:41.740]
No, I thought I thought Beast made it up.

[01:33:41.940 --> 01:33:42.120]
Right.

[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:43.460]
Just trying to start up.

[01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:45.220]
And I clicked on a Harold and fits in.

[01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:47.300]
The Harold is about a 30% chance it might be true.

[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:48.420]
About 30, man.

[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:49.240]
John.

[01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:50.960]
Let's see.

[01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:52.040]
Here's a poll suggestion.

[01:33:52.940 --> 01:33:54.340]
Okay, I'll put that in my pile.

[01:33:54.380 --> 01:33:55.560]
Thank you.

[01:33:56.120 --> 01:33:58.880]
By the way, Sean, your poll stuff yesterday.

[01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:00.260]
He tries very hard.

[01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:01.540]
We appreciate it, but it's been pretty weak.

[01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:02.180]
Pretty lame.

[01:34:04.220 --> 01:34:07.960]
Tell the idea that if they keep encouraging people to bring the kids, you know,

[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.760]
and make them fans, and yoddy-oddy-oddy.

[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:11.780]
So here's mommy and daddy and the two kids.

[01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:13.200]
That's four people.

[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:15.000]
That's 20 bucks to walk in there.

[01:34:16.540 --> 01:34:17.480]
To walk in?

[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.480]
Well, think of you'll save five if you drive in.

[01:34:21.060 --> 01:34:23.340]
That would be like you go to a Wendy's, for example.

[01:34:23.340 --> 01:34:26.980]
Now, I know that some fast food joints, they frown on walk-ups, you know.

[01:34:27.980 --> 01:34:28.920]
I'm not really sure why.

[01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:32.560]
I guess they went to the streets like drones and deadbeats or whatever.

[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:33.680]
They're having a car.

[01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:35.720]
You must be like, I just love, you know.

[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:36.740]
I've never heard of that.

[01:34:36.740 --> 01:34:37.420]
You're going to be like, do it.

[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:41.020]
Walking up to the drive-in window and saying, oh, well, you're not in the car.

[01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:42.260]
We're going to charge you an extra ten bucks.

[01:34:42.660 --> 01:34:42.900]
Mm-hmm.

[01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:44.700]
Well, I mean, what is that?

[01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:45.880]
Stupid.

[01:34:46.100 --> 01:34:48.320]
It's a phantom charge.

[01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:50.460]
It's a charge for not parking.

[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:53.080]
I've never heard of that.

[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:57.120]
It would be like, if you're driving on a city street and there's like a big parking garage.

[01:34:57.620 --> 01:34:58.140]
Uh-huh.

[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.980]
And you get there and there's a guard stops.

[01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:03.440]
You're in the middle of the street and you say, okay, it'll be five bucks perle.

[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:04.760]
Because you're not parking in our garage.

[01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:07.820]
The bottom line is they want to make money with their parking lot.

[01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:11.720]
And it hoarts them off when people are not giving them the money to park.

[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:13.420]
But you know what? Two freaking bands, okay?

[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:13.980]
Right.

[01:35:14.540 --> 01:35:16.680]
I mean, it's a long slip over there in the sub-rest.

[01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:18.340]
I said, people are willing to walk that long slip.

[01:35:18.460 --> 01:35:20.280]
And I said, you know, there's more power to them.

[01:35:22.540 --> 01:35:24.740]
Plus, everybody's vitching about how fat we all are.

[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:25.700]
We can use the exercise.

[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:27.240]
It's good to get some exercise.

[01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:29.100]
Walk across the panther parkway.

[01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:35.460]
God, I hate that whole, this whole deal, the way the people just keep getting screwed and tattooed.

[01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:36.360]
And enough with it already.

[01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:40.860]
That's one of the reasons I'm almost as disillusioned enough that you were vintered in the first place.

[01:35:41.420 --> 01:35:44.520]
The whole sports thing now just turns my stomach tired of it.

[01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:46.840]
What time's the leaves came to that?

[01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:48.560]
I'm just tired of it.

[01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:49.520]
Aren't you?

[01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:50.420]

[01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:51.200]
No.

[01:35:52.020 --> 01:35:52.800]
Yes, I am.

[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:53.580]
Yes, I am.

[01:35:53.580 --> 01:35:54.300]
It's her on leaf sludge.

[01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:56.040]
How's the weather down there?

[01:35:56.900 --> 01:35:58.080]
I'm only going to tell you this, Bob.

[01:35:58.660 --> 01:36:01.700]
It's 85 today and she's going down to 81 on Monday.

[01:36:01.980 --> 01:36:02.480]
Okay, Gray.

[01:36:02.620 --> 01:36:04.120]
Bill Waters must be in Florida somewhere.

[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:05.980]
Good place for him.

[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:07.040]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:36:07.740 --> 01:36:08.440]
Sam, good day.

[01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:09.240]
Yes, sir.

[01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:11.800]
Yeah, I was just going to agree with what George is saying.

[01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:18.680]
I have a friend of mine who has a bar across the street or in the general area of the, with a panther's play.

[01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:22.620]
And a lot of times they'll have, you know, group of people, eight ten people,

[01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:26.560]
and meet at the bar, have a couple of drinks or bite-dead, and then walk across the street over there.

[01:36:26.660 --> 01:36:30.560]
And they say to themselves, they're saving 15 bucks on the parking and they're eating or something.

[01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:34.300]
Yeah, well, we have a group of ten people that's going to cost them 50 bucks to walk across the street.

[01:36:34.940 --> 01:36:35.140]
Oh, yeah.

[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:38.760]
Now, what happens if, let's say I walk up there with my wife and two kids and I say to the guy,

[01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:40.620]
well, we're interested in going to the game tonight.

[01:36:40.780 --> 01:36:44.680]
You mean to tell me I got to pay 20 bucks to go in and see if there's any tickets available?

[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:46.240]
Absolutely, correct.

[01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:48.100]
I'm dying over here.

[01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:49.700]
Okay, good luck to Kelly.

[01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:50.380]
Stay in home.

[01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:51.620]
Moxon on TV for free.

[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:54.960]
That's my best suggestion to you all.

[01:36:55.020 --> 01:36:58.320]
You really have to listen to Dave Strader who, like Eric Reid, talks to his teeth, talks in.

[01:36:59.500 --> 01:37:00.500]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:02.200]
Yeah, it's good afternoon.

[01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:03.700]
Good afternoon, Neil.

[01:37:03.700 --> 01:37:04.140]
I'm sorry.

[01:37:04.380 --> 01:37:04.780]
Yes, sir.

[01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:05.360]
Good morning.

[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:10.460]
Yeah, I just wanted to reference the storage of the tuna and powdered milk.

[01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:11.080]
Right.

[01:37:11.580 --> 01:37:14.160]
The area beneath my bed is already fully consumed.

[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:17.080]
I have two rolls of duct tape and six rolls of this queen.

[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:17.480]
Right.

[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:19.820]
Well, no additional storage.

[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:21.820]
I think what you can do is go out and pedal that.

[01:37:21.940 --> 01:37:25.320]
You can like, pawn it and then use the money to buy the tuna in the powdered milk.

[01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:26.040]
Exactly.

[01:37:26.580 --> 01:37:31.280]
Oh, one other thing I just wanted to comment on that tease a couple weeks ago,

[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:35.380]
the tropic did a view, was very, very nicely done.

[01:37:35.660 --> 01:37:39.040]
I liked that head shot that is being on the front cover of you.

[01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:39.480]
Yeah.

[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:48.140]
But one observation, the wardrobe from 76 when you're at KET, looks like the same guy that you're using now

[01:37:48.140 --> 01:37:49.960]
to pick out your wardrobe.

[01:37:50.260 --> 01:37:51.920]
Yeah, well, this is the wardrobe that I am.

[01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:53.680]
I'm glad that you were impressed by the picture.

[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:57.760]
Obviously, the pictures of my wardrobe every day now, because obviously you were obsessed with it.

[01:37:58.080 --> 01:37:59.600]
I'm the wardrobe mistress, mister.

[01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:00.440]
I beg your pardon?

[01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:01.860]
You're the one who's in the wardrobe.

[01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:02.140]
I'm the wardrobe mistress.

[01:38:02.220 --> 01:38:03.220]
Okay, that's what you think.

[01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:06.920]
5670560, I'm sitting here in my underwear and he's worried about my wardrobe.

[01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:11.680]
Got the red, red checkered on these though, five short shorts.

[01:38:12.820 --> 01:38:14.420]
And a really nice white t-shirt, clean and pretty.

[01:38:14.420 --> 01:38:14.800]
The other one.

[01:38:14.980 --> 01:38:16.420]
Have any of the blood, blood bonsters?

[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:17.820]
No, the and these are a plan.

[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:19.040]
What did I say they were?

[01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:19.920]
Red checkered.

[01:38:20.140 --> 01:38:21.060]
Red checkered.

[01:38:21.140 --> 01:38:21.700]
Cubby checkers.

[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:24.000]
WDQ-YM, hello.

[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:28.440]
Now, may generate closing protection letters using our web CTL application on fund.

[01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:32.760]
WDQ-YM, hello.

[01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:33.940]
Hello.

[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:34.800]
The way I'm, yes.

[01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:35.320]
The way I'm, yes.

[01:38:35.860 --> 01:38:37.060]
How can I buy this?

[01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:38.600]
Oh, I love.

[01:38:41.100 --> 01:38:41.620]
What?

[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:46.100]
The van never comes downtown and I don't have a computer at home.

[01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:47.620]
How can I buy the CDs?

[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:49.120]
Can't do it.

[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.580]
5670560, pound five, 60 in the Verizon singular wire.

[01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:54.940]
Wireless line.

[01:38:55.860 --> 01:38:56.900]
Oh, God.

[01:38:57.940 --> 01:38:59.080]
I'm hanging it up, baby.

[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:01.080]
I just decided I'm hanging up my glove.

[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:06.120]
I don't have any gloves, but I could have sure used them a couple days this winter.

[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:07.080]
Probably.

[01:39:08.300 --> 01:39:10.600]
Yeah, I think, I don't know what's going on with my teeth, but I like it.

[01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:13.640]
I'll get like real sensitive now.

[01:39:13.740 --> 01:39:15.860]
You think that's from all that dental work I had, it was only last one?

[01:39:15.900 --> 01:39:16.060]
Maybe.

[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:17.280]
You think?

[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:19.600]
Maybe you just thought used to the new piece.

[01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:21.660]
No, the new piece is on the other side.

[01:39:21.820 --> 01:39:23.120]
It's got nothing to do with over in that area.

[01:39:23.300 --> 01:39:25.280]
It's like a, you know, a whole different area, man.

[01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:26.160]
Well, that don't make sense.

[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:27.200]
It's like, huh?

[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:31.460]
Well, yeah, but I think that's because that's where you had that rubber ball in my mouth.

[01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:39.100]
Oh, you hear that part of my mouth all jammed open with this big red rubber ball.

[01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:39.820]
Okay.

[01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:42.200]
Whatever they're like, you're the one that told me what it was.

[01:39:42.300 --> 01:39:43.120]
Yeah, it's rubber block.

[01:39:43.620 --> 01:39:44.660]
Right, rubber block.

[01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:45.960]
That's what it was.

[01:39:46.820 --> 01:39:46.820]

[01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:53.040]
There's nothing like having a rubber block chomping down on your gum.

[01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:57.680]
Here's line nine QA of hello.

[01:39:57.680 --> 01:39:58.180]
Hey, Neil.

[01:39:58.640 --> 01:39:58.920]
Yes, sir.

[01:39:58.940 --> 01:40:03.980]
The pay address could probably make more money by charging for the styrofoam cups to put in a low urinals.

[01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:05.620]
Yeah.

[01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:06.380]
Yeah.

[01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:08.740]
Yeah.

[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:10.860]
Meaning what?

[01:40:11.020 --> 01:40:15.780]
That story that you read about the guy that puts the styrofoam cup in the urinal and then goes and collects it.

[01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:16.620]
That was an Ohio.

[01:40:17.260 --> 01:40:17.500]
Yeah.

[01:40:17.780 --> 01:40:18.980]
He's got Miami Ohio cup.

[01:40:19.220 --> 01:40:21.640]
He was very fond of the ring.

[01:40:22.900 --> 01:40:24.620]
Dominic, QA, I am hello.

[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:27.200]
Yeah, the welcome charges just like things.

[01:40:27.340 --> 01:40:29.040]
The electricity I never got.

[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:30.820]
I'll get all the say in this morning.

[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:32.220]
Like Florida, plunder and loot.

[01:40:32.540 --> 01:40:32.740]
Charging.

[01:40:32.820 --> 01:40:33.300]
Oh, yeah.

[01:40:33.420 --> 01:40:34.300]
Well, maybe they're in Kahoot.

[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:35.460]
Wow.

[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:36.120]
They blow.

[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:37.080]
Okay.

[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:38.920]
Yeah.

[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:40.160]
The panthers blow.

[01:40:40.420 --> 01:40:40.660]
Okay.

[01:40:40.900 --> 01:40:41.980]
That's our message to you.

[01:40:42.340 --> 01:40:45.180]
Mike Keenan and Jacques Martin and all the other goy-moveter.

[01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:47.460]
God, whether organization.

[01:40:48.100 --> 01:40:50.900]
The organization wants to keep policing the public.

[01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:51.640]
There's a way to do it.

[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:53.000]
Oh, but we're doing it for your safety.

[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:53.540]
No, you're not.

[01:40:54.460 --> 01:40:56.280]
You got your finger right into it.

[01:40:56.900 --> 01:41:01.820]
They want you to, they want to coerce you into parking and giving them your money to park.

[01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:06.100]
In fact, and they're in the port off because all of these people caught on.

[01:41:06.100 --> 01:41:06.400]
They can go.

[01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:10.380]
Like the guy said, they can go right across the street, have a nice meal, a couple of brews, whatever.

[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:12.200]
Come walk across the street, go over the game.

[01:41:12.420 --> 01:41:13.300]
People do that everywhere.

[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:15.320]
There's no problem with that.

[01:41:17.180 --> 01:41:18.440]
They do that here all the time.

[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:23.380]
You think that everybody goes to the hockey or basketball games at the air-candid center is parking there for a ride.

[01:41:23.660 --> 01:41:26.740]
They're pouring across the street over there, pouring across a bay street.

[01:41:26.980 --> 01:41:28.420]
What if you take the bus or a cab?

[01:41:28.860 --> 01:41:29.080]
Yeah.

[01:41:29.340 --> 01:41:30.120]
What if you can't drive?

[01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:31.540]
Yeah, that's a good point.

[01:41:31.700 --> 01:41:33.160]
What if you take a cab?

[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:38.520]
Is the cab you're going to have to pay like five bucks for him to get in and then five for you also to go to the gate?

[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:39.080]
Just you.

[01:41:40.460 --> 01:41:43.960]
No, you're probably going to have to pay for himself too because he's a person, maybe.

[01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:47.500]
Although I've seen some of the cabs down there, but never realize you want to see the ones here.

[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:49.200]
My Schmata head friends.

[01:41:49.340 --> 01:41:50.240]
Boy, they sure love me, man.

[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:52.000]
Oh my god, they love me.

[01:41:53.700 --> 01:41:56.320]
My bearded Schmata head Indian friends.

[01:41:56.780 --> 01:41:58.300]
See, I get confused with the head gear.

[01:41:58.660 --> 01:42:00.520]
I better take a course on that.

[01:42:02.580 --> 01:42:02.820]
Okay.

[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:07.180]
They've got a couple of guys who are like, I always call for a cab who are from the line when I'm leaving Woodbine.

[01:42:07.420 --> 01:42:07.700]
Mm-hmm.

[01:42:08.060 --> 01:42:09.000]
And things are just fine.

[01:42:09.900 --> 01:42:11.420]
And it's always from the same company.

[01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:14.240]
So it's usually it's one of the same four or five guys that pressed me up.

[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:18.780]
And man, are they, but they got like the blue couple of the guys, the old guys with the grey beard, you know?

[01:42:18.900 --> 01:42:19.000]
Yeah.

[01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:20.760]
And they got the blue head gear.

[01:42:21.020 --> 01:42:21.340]
Terbans?

[01:42:21.820 --> 01:42:22.140]
Yeah.

[01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:22.840]
Seeks.

[01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:25.900]
Oh, the one guy said I'm sick.

[01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:27.380]
Like a kid that called there one day.

[01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:29.760]
Right.

[01:42:30.140 --> 01:42:31.220]
Let's go to Mount Sinai.

[01:42:32.380 --> 01:42:33.880]
What is that with a sick, you know?

[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:34.500]
What was that?

[01:42:35.220 --> 01:42:36.600]
I just put it, what is what?

[01:42:37.060 --> 01:42:37.700]
I don't know.

[01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:38.320]
I'm just sort of tired.

[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:39.400]
All this religious crap.

[01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:42.640]
I just want to live on a planet where we can get all this, get rid of it.

[01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:43.900]
Also garbage.

[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:46.520]
That's what everybody's got their own garbage, man.

[01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:47.500]
I'm just tired of it.

[01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:49.120]
All the fairy tales.

[01:42:49.220 --> 01:42:51.900]
Then I see that thing with the polygamous on A&E for two hours last night.

[01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:56.780]
I mean, you talk about, oh, it's just an excuse for these guys screwing everything in sight.

[01:42:56.960 --> 01:42:57.360]
That's all.

[01:42:57.740 --> 01:43:03.860]
And that's all that is, including their daughters and their sisters and everybody that, you know, was wearing a skirt.

[01:43:04.660 --> 01:43:05.900]
And all of them are women either.

[01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:07.440]
Well, what is that?

[01:43:08.340 --> 01:43:08.440]
Sick.

[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:10.420]
Of course, Utah.

[01:43:10.420 --> 01:43:13.880]
What is so, so holy, so much better than the rest of the world.

[01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:14.620]
What is that thought about?

[01:43:15.260 --> 01:43:15.940]
I know that.

[01:43:16.420 --> 01:43:20.200]
And they also show that because they're so much, oh, at the beginning of the show, I don't know if you didn't see it.

[01:43:20.900 --> 01:43:23.400]
They showed all of the birth defects, you know, because of all of them.

[01:43:23.400 --> 01:43:23.860]
Oh, yeah.

[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:24.500]
Yeah, it goes on.

[01:43:24.660 --> 01:43:25.720]
Because that's part of the deal.

[01:43:25.980 --> 01:43:26.440]
That's right.

[01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:27.340]
That's part of the deal.

[01:43:27.420 --> 01:43:33.320]
The girls, when they get to be a certain age, they have to get married like one of their siblings and they choose it for them.

[01:43:33.620 --> 01:43:34.480]
For the girl they choose.

[01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:35.000]
That's right.

[01:43:35.260 --> 01:43:35.700]
All of them.

[01:43:35.700 --> 01:43:38.660]
They show these, they look like a spaceship presented, you know?

[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:39.400]
Like delivered.

[01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:43.360]
And one guy, he's five or thirty-some odd children by four different wives.

[01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:46.340]
Right.

[01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:47.720]
That's exactly it.

[01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:50.760]
Man, I wouldn't even, and that would be an insult to the trailer trend.

[01:43:50.780 --> 01:43:50.940]
Right.

[01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:53.100]
New meaning to the words all in the family.

[01:43:54.260 --> 01:43:55.060]
Nice log cabin.

[01:43:57.040 --> 01:43:59.380]
12 minutes past noon at 560 W.F.M.

[01:43:59.460 --> 01:44:02.480]
We got Geltia to this afternoon and I revolving show from two to four.

[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:04.400]
It's an embarrassment and humiliating.

[01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:06.160]
It would have come to the mattresses.

[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:09.800]
It's embarrassing if you don't go to a call violin mattress because you're going to get ripped off anyplace else.

[01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:12.840]
The latest gimmick in the mattress business is a sleep number.

[01:44:13.220 --> 01:44:14.640]
Otherwise known as an air mattress.

[01:44:15.100 --> 01:44:16.660]
They're only warranty-dentful for two years.

[01:44:16.780 --> 01:44:17.440]
They squeak.

[01:44:18.020 --> 01:44:18.640]
They pop.

[01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:22.860]
They can lose their setting during the night and they cost you an arm and leg.

[01:44:23.260 --> 01:44:26.920]
If you really want a great high-quality name, Brad mattress that last you for years and years,

[01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:29.560]
then do what I've been doing for a long time.

[01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:31.020]
Call my good friends at violin mattress.

[01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:32.220]
It won 800 mattress.

[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:34.200]
When you call that number, you'll get no one around.

[01:44:34.380 --> 01:44:35.280]
No showroom, shenanigans.

[01:44:35.420 --> 01:44:37.320]
Just factory-dread prices on the best brands.

[01:44:37.460 --> 01:44:38.180]
You know trust and love.

[01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:41.960]
When you call one 800 mattress, usually largest selection in the state of Florida.

[01:44:42.140 --> 01:44:44.400]
The top names in the business like Sirna, Cele.

[01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:48.060]
Simmons, King Coral, Trevor Pintik, Steerings and Banana Sposter already for a safety delivery.

[01:44:48.260 --> 01:44:49.980]
It prices lower than so-called big name chain stores.

[01:44:50.420 --> 01:44:51.680]
Even during the big sales.

[01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:53.160]
Call one 800 mattress.

[01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:53.760]
You can have the bid.

[01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:54.640]
You want to live a date and time.

[01:44:54.780 --> 01:44:55.640]
You want a two-hour delivery window.

[01:44:55.940 --> 01:44:56.520]
You pick the time.

[01:44:56.660 --> 01:44:58.120]
Two to four three to five and they show up.

[01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:03.280]
I've been a satisfied QM customer for QM customer and dial mattress customer for years.

[01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:04.200]
And you will be too.

[01:45:04.460 --> 01:45:06.380]
Not so satisfied with QM, but I like dial mattress.

[01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:07.760]
Call them today toll-free.

[01:45:07.860 --> 01:45:10.800]
1-800-MATRUS or log onto their website mattress.com.

[01:45:11.140 --> 01:45:13.580]
That's 1-800-MATR-ES.

[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:17.120]
Leave off the last S because it stands for sensational saving.

[01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:18.320]
This is five!

[01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:19.020]
Stop it!

[01:45:19.180 --> 01:45:20.500]
I was thinking about Tom Jikker again.

[01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:22.880]
This is Neil Rogers.

[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:27.160]
This is 5-16-Q-A-E-M.

[01:45:33.020 --> 01:45:34.920]
5-6-6-Q-A-E-M.

[01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:34.920]

[01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:37.440]
Baby launch a couple minutes old.

[01:45:37.580 --> 01:45:37.800]
Yes!

[01:45:38.260 --> 01:45:40.300]
Turned away sweet no.

[01:45:41.060 --> 01:45:44.400]
And aim a mad-of-fellah.

[01:45:44.700 --> 01:45:47.560]
Whose first name begins with old.

[01:45:48.660 --> 01:45:53.180]
There's one thing we all understake.

[01:45:54.280 --> 01:46:00.900]
You have to be finished until we blow up Pakistan.

[01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:10.100]
We could chase and round forever with our tanks and all our crews.

[01:46:10.900 --> 01:46:16.360]
But special forces are so tired of jumping through them.

[01:46:17.380 --> 01:46:22.340]
You throw me knee to another plane.

[01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:30.200]
So let's cut out all the nonsense and go blow up Pakistan.

[01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:32.200]
Oh right!

[01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:38.060]
Now get a knee to nuclear tank.

[01:46:38.060 --> 01:46:43.040]
Why don't we stop the steep food?

[01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:47.880]
You fell and broke blow up Pakistan.

[01:46:54.300 --> 01:46:55.420]
Who knows?

[01:46:55.740 --> 01:46:57.780]
The FBI just died the other day.

[01:46:57.860 --> 01:46:58.620]
He was 75.

[01:46:58.840 --> 01:46:59.060]
He's dead.

[01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:02.420]
Bunch of us boom boom, jeffreyon.

[01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:03.300]
Oh all the time.

[01:47:04.220 --> 01:47:07.620]
And then we got that big name because of his booming slap shot he's dead.

[01:47:08.580 --> 01:47:10.140]
Palestinian prisoners surrendered to Israeli troops.

[01:47:10.140 --> 01:47:11.580]
Guess what walls are tumbling down?

[01:47:11.580 --> 01:47:13.120]
The walls in Jericho are tumbling down.

[01:47:17.300 --> 01:47:19.860]
Six Palestinians in fact they just showed on CNN moments ago.

[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:21.180]
All those ugly Palestinian prisoners.

[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:22.060]
Oh boy!

[01:47:22.900 --> 01:47:23.720]
They look nasty.

[01:47:24.820 --> 01:47:26.700]
Although I see I've met some Palestinians who are well.

[01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:33.180]
Six Palestinian inmates surrendered Tuesday after holding up for hours in a Palestinian prison surrounded by Israeli troops sources inside the prison said.

[01:47:34.260 --> 01:47:37.820]
Israel had moved in the seas to prisoners after the US and British monitors left the compound.

[01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:42.520]
And Palestinian guards clandered Israeli forces leaving a Palestinian policeman dead several others wounded.

[01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:53.240]
Israeli defense forces operation comes a week after Palestinian authority president Makhmoud Abbas said he was prepared to free one of these six Ahmed Sadat.

[01:47:53.420 --> 01:48:00.460]
Head of the popular front of the Liberation of Palestine, allegedly ordered the 2001 killing of Israeli troops minister Rahab Ahmed Zemi.

[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:05.400]
Would you see that American was he a doctor or whatever they had they were holding him hostage to let him they turn him loose.

[01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:08.300]
Good, they scared they scared the she out out of him.

[01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:10.080]
Man, did you see that?

[01:48:11.060 --> 01:48:15.080]
I thought there was Palestinian terrorists those really guts you guys with all the smatters over their heads?

[01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:17.000]
Nice head year.

[01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:19.780]
Anyway, and one more now it's 86.

[01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:23.040]
We're going to try to keep your emotional care about those poor wreckies.

[01:48:23.140 --> 01:48:25.080]
It was 85 on the last break now it's 86.

[01:48:25.500 --> 01:48:28.820]
And speaking of 86, how's our total coming at John the Baker?

[01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:29.980]
Close to that we got 80.

[01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:35.440]
Six?

[01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:36.920]
Sure.

[01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:39.340]
86, the whole thing.

[01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:42.960]
16,750 now we got a shot at getting up there over 17,000.

[01:48:43.260 --> 01:48:47.320]
I mean all we needed was 330 bucks today to go over 17 grand.

[01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:49.220]
You know the need out we're going to do that?

[01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:49.500]
No.

[01:48:50.420 --> 01:48:51.300]
No, we're going to get it.

[01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:53.600]
We got an hour and 40 minutes for Christ's sake.

[01:48:53.980 --> 01:48:56.060]
Come on get away to John the Baker get you a nice lunch.

[01:48:57.120 --> 01:48:59.160]
He only charges you 100 bucks to park there.

[01:49:00.620 --> 01:49:04.680]
That's that the Home Depot shopping center finds in Flamingo 125 92 pounds full of art.

[01:49:05.140 --> 01:49:06.380]
Roles there right now.

[01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:10.380]
Is he giving away any Panthers parking passes? Probably not because nobody wants to go to Panther games anyway.

[01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:13.460]
Anyway speaking of that I got two factions on this.

[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:20.060]
I hate to break the news to the Panther organization, but you folks have made a bad, bad mistake.

[01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:22.080]
A bad move.

[01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:29.940]
Because we never get factions or crawls about the Panthers, about hockey, about the Macarena, about anything to do with any of this.

[01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:30.820]
All these things.

[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:31.520]
Do we?

[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:32.420]
No.

[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:33.400]
Almost never.

[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:36.180]
But today you got the people parked off.

[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:40.980]
Here's the fact that says and I think and it's from University Dodgers, both campers buddies up to it again.

[01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:42.980]
At least they listen.

[01:49:44.420 --> 01:49:46.960]
The food at the office Depot center is not overpriced.

[01:49:46.980 --> 01:49:48.620]
The food it's often stay in is overpriced.

[01:49:48.620 --> 01:49:51.940]
The food and drink at the office Depot center, now they do whatever they want.

[01:49:52.020 --> 01:49:55.440]
The bank and line they rent at the end of the center is highway freaking robbery it says.

[01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:56.760]
Not just overpriced.

[01:49:56.780 --> 01:49:59.120]
Highway freaking robbery underlined it.

[01:49:59.860 --> 01:50:01.960]
A 20 ounce bottle of coke is $5.

[01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:03.320]
$5.

[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:05.020]
I can buy a case of that for $5.

[01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:06.560]
It says never mind the $7.

[01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:07.460]
Great Dean Burger.

[01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:10.820]
Heard it was right.

[01:50:11.020 --> 01:50:11.020]

[01:50:11.460 --> 01:50:12.780]
For a burger at a ballgame.

[01:50:13.220 --> 01:50:13.720]
How do you like that?

[01:50:15.900 --> 01:50:18.700]
The best part is if this stuff was good, that would be another story.

[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:21.040]
It is marginal at best.

[01:50:21.540 --> 01:50:22.100]
At best.

[01:50:24.060 --> 01:50:27.900]
Here's one that says how about all the Lexus owners with the John SUVs pick up the people at the mall.

[01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:29.740]
If you're out of the stadium and charge them only.

[01:50:30.900 --> 01:50:31.420]
A very modest.

[01:50:31.700 --> 01:50:32.060]
Eight bucks.

[01:50:32.300 --> 01:50:32.900]
Yeah, that would be good.

[01:50:33.140 --> 01:50:33.840]
That's the fact says.

[01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:36.100]
I want to ask everybody Mark again.

[01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:37.120]
I can tell about a hit or a can.

[01:50:37.260 --> 01:50:38.280]
He's leaving his name over there.

[01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:38.640]
It's him.

[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:39.540]
It's him.

[01:50:39.620 --> 01:50:40.260]
We're out of your mark.

[01:50:40.620 --> 01:50:40.620]

[01:50:40.620 --> 01:50:42.340]
A single paid fact that's fine.

[01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:48.880]
The first day isn't complete unless he can you know get a fax and he's got to be just like the guy in LA now that Paul guy who sent the follow up.

[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:52.840]
It was good though about grace grace Nancy or Grace Jones.

[01:50:54.300 --> 01:50:55.120]
Thousand and eight.

[01:50:55.220 --> 01:50:58.260]
We're going to go over 1100 votes on the pull this hour of one thousand ninety three.

[01:50:58.500 --> 01:51:06.320]
And it's so it's heartwarming to see that most of you are just enchanted and numbered with your spouses, your significant others or maybe both.

[01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:07.800]
Beautiful.

[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:08.860]
That nice to see.

[01:51:09.180 --> 01:51:09.420]
Sweet.

[01:51:11.480 --> 01:51:13.960]
A little disturbed about that only 80 bucks there at that.

[01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:15.820]
I mean that that's a place there's no excuses.

[01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:17.580]
This is the barometer for me today.

[01:51:17.780 --> 01:51:17.940]
Okay.

[01:51:18.540 --> 01:51:19.280]
This is the barometer.

[01:51:19.540 --> 01:51:23.220]
I mean, if you don't get with it, we're going to stick the thermometer right where the moon don't shine.

[01:51:25.080 --> 01:51:28.300]
Because don't you think this is a I mean pines and flamingo.

[01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:30.080]
That's the epicent of our listening audience.

[01:51:30.140 --> 01:51:31.500]
That's a well with that area at all.

[01:51:31.660 --> 01:51:32.080]
At all.

[01:51:33.320 --> 01:51:34.280]
It's not far from you.

[01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:35.700]
It's not far from me as a matter of fact.

[01:51:35.820 --> 01:51:36.760]
What's kind of far from me now?

[01:51:47.060 --> 01:51:48.380]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:51:48.380 --> 01:51:48.380]

[01:51:48.380 --> 01:51:48.460]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:51:48.460 --> 01:51:48.540]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:51:48.540 --> 01:51:52.140]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:51:52.380 --> 01:51:53.300]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:51:53.300 --> 01:51:55.000]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:51:55.720 --> 01:51:57.740]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:51:58.160 --> 01:52:01.460]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:52:01.460 --> 01:52:03.780]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:52:03.860 --> 01:52:06.740]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:52:10.980 --> 01:52:13.780]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:52:13.780 --> 01:52:13.920]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:13.920]

[01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:13.920]

[01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:14.800]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:16.260]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:52:16.260 --> 01:52:17.360]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:52:17.360 --> 01:52:19.740]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:52:19.740 --> 01:52:22.200]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:52:22.520 --> 01:52:25.680]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:52:26.120 --> 01:52:36.720]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:52:54.900 --> 01:53:00.860]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:53:00.860 --> 01:53:00.860]

[01:53:00.860 --> 01:53:00.860]

[01:53:00.860 --> 01:53:00.860]

[01:53:00.860 --> 01:53:00.900]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:53:00.900 --> 01:53:00.960]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:01.340]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:53:01.340 --> 01:53:01.500]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:03.280]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:06.500]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:53:06.500 --> 01:53:06.700]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:17.100]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:17.320]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:17.320]

[01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:17.320]

[01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:18.180]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:53:18.180 --> 01:53:18.840]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:20.700]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:53:21.960 --> 01:53:24.740]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:28.280]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:53:28.280 --> 01:53:32.040]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:36.680]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:53:50.680 --> 01:53:53.300]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:53:53.620 --> 01:53:53.680]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:53.680]

[01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:53.680]

[01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:53.700]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:53:53.700 --> 01:53:53.700]

[01:53:53.700 --> 01:53:53.700]

[01:53:53.700 --> 01:53:54.080]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:53:54.080 --> 01:53:55.120]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:56.000]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:06.660]
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:54:06.660 --> 01:54:07.280]
You keep picking.

[01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:09.620]
All the conditions are right, but you see what the cost of the card is.

[01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:13.440]
What's the number of Democrats that are never going to a proctologist because he couldn't find their spine.

[01:54:14.500 --> 01:54:16.060]
I'm okay with anything. I love you.

[01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:17.520]
Happy Super.

[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:18.820]
Happy Purim, baby.

[01:54:18.920 --> 01:54:19.720]
Get the holidays right.

[01:54:20.300 --> 01:54:22.820]
Just like Hank yesterday, Hawkingwood at Stepabout the Dradel.

[01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:24.700]
Dradel is for Hanukkah, baby.

[01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:25.820]
Tanuka.

[01:54:26.420 --> 01:54:27.180]
Not for Purim.

[01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:28.480]
Purim is Homenthaishan.

[01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:32.980]
And then we got Pasta, where your Paisadiki candies and your wine and your Mata.

[01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:35.560]
Your Mata Brie, which I have no idea of.

[01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:36.940]
That's something that's coming out of Moush.

[01:54:37.300 --> 01:54:38.460]
I don't know about the brine.

[01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:39.140]
It's a ball, though.

[01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:40.260]
Huh?

[01:54:40.820 --> 01:54:41.180]
Lots of brine.

[01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:41.720]
Yeah.

[01:54:41.980 --> 01:54:42.660]
Lots of brine.

[01:54:43.940 --> 01:54:44.620]
I heard you.

[01:54:44.700 --> 01:54:45.320]
Now, what about you?

[01:54:45.460 --> 01:54:48.720]
Have what about if you put, if you put breachies on Mata's, that Mata Brie?

[01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:49.760]
Sounds right.

[01:54:50.020 --> 01:54:50.220]
Ooh.

[01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:50.960]
Let's try it.

[01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:54.800]
26 past noon, and for strictly for glam at 560-12, Mata.

[01:54:54.960 --> 01:54:55.300]
The beautiful.

[01:55:02.220 --> 01:55:03.680]
Moush is a wheeze.

[01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:05.500]
Watching the market.

[01:55:06.420 --> 01:55:07.140]
Car's bound.

[01:55:07.620 --> 01:55:08.120]
Car's bound.

[01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:10.260]
Car's bound.

[01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:10.660]
Ooh.

[01:55:11.780 --> 01:55:14.240]
Another effort is better than spunk and bad.

[01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:19.180]
Ooh.

[01:55:19.660 --> 01:55:20.700]
A lot of people are going up.

[01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:23.820]
Who wants to hear a talk, guys?

[01:55:24.780 --> 01:55:26.800]
What the hell did we do?

[01:55:28.140 --> 01:55:31.020]
Do keep this, why do we all hang in?

[01:55:32.380 --> 01:55:35.500]
That new torture, who is a boonie?

[01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:38.580]
Who is a boonie?

[01:55:38.660 --> 01:55:41.060]
Give it a Christian right to do something right.

[01:55:41.100 --> 01:55:42.180]
Who is a boonie?

[01:55:42.820 --> 01:55:43.980]
Who is a boonie?

[01:55:44.620 --> 01:55:45.820]
A precious boonie?

[01:55:46.940 --> 01:55:47.140]
Ah.

[01:55:48.740 --> 01:55:50.280]
Here's your last Sunday.

[01:55:51.580 --> 01:55:53.580]
Do a whole new way.

[01:55:55.540 --> 01:55:57.440]
Stop with all this magic.

[01:55:58.820 --> 01:56:02.200]
Let me wash back who says he's a boonie.

[01:56:04.220 --> 01:56:05.260]
Who says he's a boonie?

[01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:08.020]
A boy would hate you for a when you went away.

[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:08.840]
He's a boonie.

[01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:10.620]
Who says he's a boonie?

[01:56:11.300 --> 01:56:12.400]
A precious boonie.

[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:14.360]
Watch it, how much it's bound.

[01:56:14.860 --> 01:56:15.380]
Car's bound.

[01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:19.340]
Car's bound.

[01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:26.700]
I'm taking one thing that Ross stories.com, that's one of my favorite websites and they read, they read, jiggered it.

[01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:33.420]
So now it's like easier to read and it doesn't have that little teeny tiny print and that flaming red background that was kind of like winding.

[01:56:34.100 --> 01:56:34.500]
What about you?

[01:56:34.700 --> 01:56:34.980]
I don't like that.

[01:56:36.200 --> 01:56:36.560]
Flaming?

[01:56:36.780 --> 01:56:36.920]
No.

[01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:37.840]
Not into flavors.

[01:56:38.260 --> 01:56:40.360]
Okay, what's the, what's the, what's the, a total mile?

[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:41.160]
290.

[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:42.920]
Hey, that's not bad.

[01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:43.500]
No, it's not.

[01:56:43.580 --> 01:56:44.000]
Not at all.

[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:48.400]
Oh, man, I told you we're going to do some serious, ask you an old style today.

[01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:50.060]
16,000, 765.

[01:56:51.080 --> 01:56:51.640]
Is that right?

[01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:52.700]
No, that's wrong.

[01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:56.920]
We got almost the 17 grand, 670 and 290 is what?

[01:56:57.520 --> 01:56:58.240]
Is 960.

[01:56:58.940 --> 01:57:05.960]
16th, you realize that the second deal, the second person with a 20 is going to wind up putting this over 17 grand.

[01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:07.900]
So it gets the special pattern ahead from Rolex.

[01:57:08.100 --> 01:57:08.680]
And a parking pass.

[01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:09.520]
No.

[01:57:11.500 --> 01:57:15.480]
ACLU releases first concrete evidence of domestic spying for anti-war views.

[01:57:15.480 --> 01:57:17.320]
This just in from your friends at Ross Story.

[01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:19.000]
How come you're so newsy?

[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:19.840]
Because I feel like it.

[01:57:19.880 --> 01:57:20.360]
How do you like that?

[01:57:20.460 --> 01:57:20.920]
Remember that guy?

[01:57:21.380 --> 01:57:25.680]
You're so newsy that New Yorkie guy, go back to New York, get lost because I feel like it.

[01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:27.580]
I do whatever I like feel like.

[01:57:27.620 --> 01:57:30.080]
I'm on one thing I'll say, not too much I'll say for these people.

[01:57:30.340 --> 01:57:31.940]
They don't tell me what else I do on the show, you know?

[01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:35.120]
Although I do know I had a really panicky when I was straight into play music.

[01:57:35.340 --> 01:57:36.560]
I had them really nervous.

[01:57:37.220 --> 01:57:40.180]
I don't want to mention their real name, but they were really nervous.

[01:57:40.500 --> 01:57:43.620]
Of course this is the same guy that told me, oh I know that we just stay on the air.

[01:57:43.780 --> 01:57:45.880]
It's just Dick, I know you can say whatever you want about you.

[01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:46.440]
Right.

[01:57:47.080 --> 01:57:50.240]
But the first time I threaten to start playing music, man, I don't know how you can play music.

[01:57:50.560 --> 01:57:50.560]

[01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:51.840]
Nervous.

[01:57:52.200 --> 01:57:53.200]
Just relax, Joe.

[01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:54.780]
Okay, you're a good guy just to stay away.

[01:57:56.200 --> 01:58:00.740]
Documents released today by the ACLU reveal that the FBI, a lot of initials maybe,

[01:58:01.860 --> 01:58:04.060]
as in GD and the FU and whatever.

[01:58:05.460 --> 01:58:09.260]
Reveal that the FBI has indeed monitored political groups solely on the basis

[01:58:09.260 --> 01:58:10.900]
that they oppose the U.S. led war.

[01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:16.940]
According to what memo written in 2002, the FBI launched a classified investigation

[01:58:16.940 --> 01:58:20.400]
of the activities of Pittsburgh's Thomas Merton Center after becoming concerned

[01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:23.720]
that the group held daily leaflet distribution activities in downtown Pittsburgh

[01:58:23.720 --> 01:58:27.060]
and was currently focused on its opposition to the Potential War in Iraq.

[01:58:27.960 --> 01:58:30.860]
The memo aimed to summarize the investigation's results.

[01:58:30.860 --> 01:58:35.320]
It identifies the group as a left-wing organization advocating among many political causes,

[01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:36.600]
pacifism.

[01:58:36.920 --> 01:58:38.500]
Oh my god, they're dangerous.

[01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:38.520]
Oh my god.

[01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:39.920]
They're really dangerous people.

[01:58:40.360 --> 01:58:44.300]
Those pacifists like the Quakers, they're feeling the roads.

[01:58:45.540 --> 01:58:49.540]
The ACLU is filed Freedom of Information Act to request and be have over 150 organizations

[01:58:49.540 --> 01:58:53.100]
and individuals that documents released as a result of revealed monitoring infiltration

[01:58:53.100 --> 01:58:57.840]
of political environmental anti-war and faith-based groups by the FBI and local law enforcement agencies

[01:58:57.840 --> 01:59:02.460]
like those cookie-baking criminals out there in San Diego in Fair 9-11.

[01:59:02.840 --> 01:59:03.120]
Remember them?

[01:59:03.380 --> 01:59:04.220]
That's right, they were cookie.

[01:59:04.860 --> 01:59:08.560]
Yeah, something is seriously wrong in how our government determines

[01:59:08.560 --> 01:59:12.000]
what constitutes terrorism when peace activists find themselves targeted

[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:16.420]
or mark Jim Klystler, executive director of the Thomas Merton Center for Peace and Justice

[01:59:17.380 --> 01:59:23.240]
and anybody with a half a brain knows where we have to go for justice.

[01:59:24.740 --> 01:59:25.300]
Right?

[01:59:25.540 --> 01:59:25.920]
You can do it.

[01:59:26.760 --> 01:59:28.080]
I don't, do I have it?

[01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:28.680]
Oh yeah.

[01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:29.800]
Long Coyote.

[01:59:30.020 --> 01:59:30.480]
Oh there it is.

[01:59:30.600 --> 01:59:31.320]
I forgot what was under.

[01:59:31.420 --> 01:59:32.300]
It's under Luca under Luca.

[01:59:32.580 --> 01:59:33.660]
Oh Luca, won't see him anymore.

[01:59:33.860 --> 01:59:34.860]
Let me, let me worry about Luca.

[01:59:36.160 --> 01:59:37.100]
I'm doing the job thing.

[01:59:37.240 --> 01:59:38.120]
You can't see it though, but.

[01:59:38.420 --> 01:59:39.320]
He's a very scary guy.

[01:59:40.840 --> 01:59:41.240]
That's true.

[01:59:41.720 --> 01:59:43.480]
Here's a fact from a hockey fan.

[01:59:43.900 --> 01:59:45.120]
I can't read what it says there in the bottom.

[01:59:45.220 --> 01:59:45.840]
Something about Dean.

[01:59:47.180 --> 01:59:47.800]
What's the best word?

[01:59:47.980 --> 01:59:48.360]
Something about Dean.

[01:59:48.540 --> 01:59:49.260]
Oh, can't read it.

[01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:52.540]
As in the Yorker, that remembers the great islander teams.

[01:59:52.540 --> 01:59:55.180]
I appreciate, oh, by the way, the islander arena they have are

[01:59:56.100 --> 02:00:01.800]
the pipes of burst and locker rooms are full of like manure and stuff and, oh, they have problems

[02:00:01.800 --> 02:00:02.440]
there along the island.

[02:00:02.600 --> 02:00:05.920]
In fact, the highlight in the news of the post yesterday said, islanders stink.

[02:00:07.840 --> 02:00:11.980]
It says, I appreciate the owners efforts to be successful by retaining the two great players and.

[02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:13.960]
And what does that say?

[02:00:15.560 --> 02:00:16.260]
Grass for me.

[02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:17.360]
Grant.

[02:00:18.400 --> 02:00:18.560]
Grant.

[02:00:19.300 --> 02:00:20.700]
I have no idea what that word is.

[02:00:20.700 --> 02:00:26.600]
I am going to support the panties by going to some games and putting up with some stadium crap.

[02:00:27.140 --> 02:00:33.400]
A and E.O. let's hear it with a hockey talk and lay off these stereotypical black jokes where you happy quorum.

[02:00:33.900 --> 02:00:34.460]
Oh, God.

[02:00:34.620 --> 02:00:36.620]
This is one of the worst fake facts in the history of mankind.

[02:00:37.340 --> 02:00:37.720]
It's really weak.

[02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:39.800]
5670560.

[02:00:40.580 --> 02:00:43.840]
Palm 560 on the Verizon and Secular wireless lines.

[02:00:45.180 --> 02:00:45.680]
Line 9.

[02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:46.640]
That's Josh's favorite.

[02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:47.200]
QAM.

[02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:47.860]
Newteline.

[02:00:49.760 --> 02:00:50.160]
Hello.

[02:00:54.060 --> 02:00:56.840]
I'd say the one thing, they're just obsessed with Eddie.

[02:00:57.460 --> 02:00:58.620]
You ain't no Eddie.

[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:00.400]
A lot of people, they're Eddie wannabes.

[02:01:00.580 --> 02:01:01.420]
He was only one Eddie.

[02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:05.080]
But there's so many, and it's always on line 9, too.

[02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:06.560]
There's just something about the Eddie line.

[02:01:08.960 --> 02:01:10.100]
Eddie was number one.

[02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:11.980]
I mean, is there any doubt?

[02:01:12.220 --> 02:01:13.600]
I mean, when you hear that, there's only one.

[02:01:14.020 --> 02:01:15.580]
Eddie comes out of the box strong.

[02:01:15.880 --> 02:01:16.200]
Not the bug.

[02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:17.440]
Yeah, bug.

[02:01:17.660 --> 02:01:17.980]
Yeah, bug.

[02:01:18.100 --> 02:01:20.260]
I think that's Eddie wannabes.

[02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:20.980]
It's very weak.

[02:01:21.720 --> 02:01:22.040]
5670.

[02:01:22.040 --> 02:01:22.560]
Look at that phone.

[02:01:22.680 --> 02:01:23.700]
Maybe there ain't nothing going on.

[02:01:23.820 --> 02:01:25.200]
Just like there's probably not much going on out there.

[02:01:25.240 --> 02:01:26.580]
John DeBaker, which is very sad.

[02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:29.920]
Because Rolie's out there's got $1 billion in cash.

[02:01:30.140 --> 02:01:30.840]
He's going to give away not.

[02:01:32.580 --> 02:01:34.100]
And a whole bunch of parking passes.

[02:01:34.300 --> 02:01:34.440]
Yes.

[02:01:36.440 --> 02:01:36.760]
5670560.

[02:01:36.900 --> 02:01:38.040]
See we started with the Panther talk.

[02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:40.040]
I had that one facts and that's the end of the whole boy.

[02:01:40.260 --> 02:01:42.040]
That's the, that's the, that's the fact that it's from across the street.

[02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:43.920]
You guys talk about the Panthers, okay?

[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:44.960]
We're not talking about that.

[02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:46.240]
We're talking about the rape of the public.

[02:01:46.700 --> 02:01:49.940]
That's nothing to do with Panther games, pansy games, any of these things.

[02:01:50.140 --> 02:01:51.500]
Crowling matches, none of that.

[02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:53.540]
Company QYM, hello.

[02:01:54.540 --> 02:01:55.420]
Not the company meal.

[02:01:55.840 --> 02:01:56.140]
Yes, sir.

[02:01:57.320 --> 02:02:01.900]
When you were at the studio in Zeta, who was the DJ that used to lay down on the floor?

[02:02:04.220 --> 02:02:04.940]
Dave Capreda.

[02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:06.700]
Yeah, why did he do that?

[02:02:07.300 --> 02:02:08.040]
I never understood.

[02:02:08.100 --> 02:02:12.800]
Because he ate so much that he would get like over, just overloaded and would just pass out

[02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:13.360]
in line of the floor.

[02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:17.160]
Oh, I was wondering if he was in, he used to bring us in tons of food in the morning,

[02:02:17.180 --> 02:02:18.340]
just tons of food.

[02:02:18.660 --> 02:02:20.940]
What ever happened to pee pee from Pemberpine?

[02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:23.680]
And he sleeps with the fishes like Hooker Broughtse.

[02:02:24.680 --> 02:02:25.040]
5670560.

[02:02:25.860 --> 02:02:27.920]
Pan 560, now we're getting to the good calls, baby.

[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:29.260]
Yeah, what happened to the bird?

[02:02:29.500 --> 02:02:30.540]
He also sleeps with the fishes.

[02:02:32.500 --> 02:02:33.120]
WQA, hello.

[02:02:33.860 --> 02:02:35.260]
Hey, how's the hangin', my lord?

[02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:37.180]
In fact, he might be under the bed with a tuna fish.

[02:02:37.300 --> 02:02:37.600]
Yes, sir.

[02:02:38.380 --> 02:02:42.220]
Hey, where are we gonna get to, where are we gonna get that CD on lime wire, George?

[02:02:44.600 --> 02:02:45.980]
And how about a coffee mug?

[02:02:46.460 --> 02:02:48.080]
I love my mo coffee mug.

[02:02:48.620 --> 02:02:49.760]
How many QAAM, hello?

[02:02:50.500 --> 02:02:50.860]
Hello?

[02:02:51.260 --> 02:02:52.220]
One of your people, obviously.

[02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:52.600]
Yes, sir.

[02:02:52.700 --> 02:02:53.180]
Right, right.

[02:02:53.420 --> 02:02:54.340]
Hey, who knew how to go in?

[02:02:55.020 --> 02:02:55.380]
Okay.

[02:02:57.040 --> 02:02:57.760]
Um, shit.

[02:02:58.080 --> 02:02:58.420]
All sorry.

[02:02:58.920 --> 02:02:59.120]
Yeah.

[02:02:59.560 --> 02:03:00.400]
One of your people.

[02:03:00.780 --> 02:03:01.040]
Yeah.

[02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:03.500]
He was more entertained than your guy.

[02:03:04.980 --> 02:03:08.120]
Even though we had a dump at a tourist, why I think it had to be the other guy said.

[02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:09.140]
You did?

[02:03:09.340 --> 02:03:09.760]
Smart ass.

[02:03:09.880 --> 02:03:10.140]
Should've.

[02:03:10.840 --> 02:03:11.440]
Why is that?

[02:03:11.700 --> 02:03:13.220]
Well, as it turns out, we did.

[02:03:14.140 --> 02:03:14.620]
See that?

[02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:15.300]
There was a guy.

[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:15.860]
You see that?

[02:03:16.340 --> 02:03:17.380]
Yeah, stop and think about it.

[02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:18.600]
It's our 85 minute delay.

[02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:20.000]
You can be damn sure he didn't get on it.

[02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:22.340]
You're just pissed off because he was a...

[02:03:22.340 --> 02:03:23.560]
Well, what was he asking you about?

[02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:25.020]
Are you just not talking about it?

[02:03:25.380 --> 02:03:26.000]
What do you mean by that?

[02:03:26.580 --> 02:03:27.980]
It's what we don't want to talk about.

[02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:31.000]
How about a pack of this with facts?

[02:03:32.020 --> 02:03:32.160]
Huh?

[02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:33.460]
I'll send you a facts about it.

[02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:33.980]
Okay.

[02:03:34.860 --> 02:03:36.020]
Anyway, how many votes do we have?

[02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:36.400]
Look at that.

[02:03:36.480 --> 02:03:38.340]
Which party would you do better job by handling your rack?

[02:03:38.340 --> 02:03:39.560]
And I just didn't see what it was.

[02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:40.480]
They both suck.

[02:03:42.100 --> 02:03:42.740]
1127 votes.

[02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:44.060]
We got over 1100 votes on the poll.

[02:03:44.160 --> 02:03:46.120]
That means we're going to have to raise like resilience today.

[02:03:46.360 --> 02:03:47.120]
Can you feel it?

[02:03:47.180 --> 02:03:47.940]
Can you almost smell it?

[02:03:48.060 --> 02:03:48.440]
Feel something.

[02:03:49.700 --> 02:03:52.780]
You all know the name dry concepts because I've been talking about them for over 20 years

[02:03:52.780 --> 02:03:54.780]
on the show and used to infect it where they're my house yesterday.

[02:03:54.920 --> 02:03:58.160]
And I'm sure that the carpets are looked just like brand new lead on the floor.

[02:03:58.520 --> 02:03:59.500]
And they'll do the same for you.

[02:04:00.060 --> 02:04:02.640]
Before you go out and spend thousands of replaced your soiled carpeting,

[02:04:03.080 --> 02:04:05.440]
give dry concepts a call and bring those carpets back to life.

[02:04:05.520 --> 02:04:07.240]
They'll look and smell and feel just like brand new.

[02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:10.440]
They'll be vibrant in color, soft of the touch, and staying free.

[02:04:10.920 --> 02:04:13.740]
And dry concepts is the only company that you ought to trust because like I said,

[02:04:16.940 --> 02:04:18.700]

Oh, a run-zo. You're so big.

[02:05:22.900 --> 02:05:25.700]
You experience as new age music before.

[02:05:26.220 --> 02:05:27.800]

Yes, all the mind-n-e-n-estries of craftsmanship you've endured for years,

[02:05:44.660 --> 02:05:50.620]
and elevators in this office and supermarkets, performed live from the local lock-up.

[02:05:50.880 --> 02:05:57.200]
Plus, all new tracks like aggravated assault on the sunrise were screening order of dreams.

[02:05:57.200 --> 02:06:02.880]
And the rain must fall, and so would you, if you could believe me, you are.

[02:06:03.380 --> 02:06:06.540]

Call now for Yani, captured live from the county jail.

[02:06:21.980 --> 02:06:25.060]
1245 gets into some education, Dean, before he sends in more faxes.

[02:06:25.060 --> 02:06:25.940]
I mean, this is pathetic.

[02:06:26.520 --> 02:06:28.480]
Headwriting sucked, and so does everything else on it.

[02:06:29.140 --> 02:06:31.620]
By the way, all the guy said was he was a real live-wire.

[02:06:33.080 --> 02:06:33.560]
No, no.

[02:06:35.880 --> 02:06:36.520]
With you.

[02:06:36.780 --> 02:06:37.100]
Ah!

[02:06:40.700 --> 02:06:42.160]
Just a little joke, okay?

[02:06:42.300 --> 02:06:43.720]
Just a little joke, yes sir.

[02:06:43.840 --> 02:06:44.480]
I've been very close.

[02:06:45.040 --> 02:06:46.400]
I'm not winkin' at Josh over here.

[02:06:47.580 --> 02:06:49.880]
Anyway, what do we got so far?

[02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:50.760]
Let's find out.

[02:06:50.880 --> 02:06:52.440]
And I just made a decision, okay?

[02:06:53.320 --> 02:06:56.600]
Because this is, I don't want to do this every day until like the middle of June.

[02:06:56.600 --> 02:06:57.760]
It's only the middle of March.

[02:06:58.360 --> 02:06:59.380]
You out of your mind?

[02:07:00.480 --> 02:07:01.160]
You're crazy.

[02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:05.000]
We can leave it on our website, if the rest of the year for my part, I don't care how long it's on here.

[02:07:05.140 --> 02:07:07.020]
Right? Doesn't know sweat off our ass.

[02:07:08.320 --> 02:07:11.580]
But if you think we're going to do these vans, and begging for money every day,

[02:07:11.620 --> 02:07:14.400]
then the middle of June, that is bad radio, okay?

[02:07:14.720 --> 02:07:17.800]
It is freaking ponderous is what it is.

[02:07:17.800 --> 02:07:21.900]
I say to like the middle of April, another month.

[02:07:22.520 --> 02:07:24.180]
No April fooling either, one month.

[02:07:25.300 --> 02:07:25.600]
What?

[02:07:25.980 --> 02:07:26.560]
Sounds plenty.

[02:07:26.860 --> 02:07:28.180]
That's where I'm sayin'.

[02:07:28.180 --> 02:07:30.220]
Until my April vacation, which is in April.

[02:07:31.780 --> 02:07:32.840]
We're doing tax time.

[02:07:33.740 --> 02:07:34.480]
Does that sound like a plan?

[02:07:34.800 --> 02:07:35.420]
Now what do we got there?

[02:07:35.520 --> 02:07:36.580]
I bet we're over 17 grand.

[02:07:37.060 --> 02:07:37.760]
We got three paid.

[02:07:38.440 --> 02:07:39.080]
60 more.

[02:07:39.180 --> 02:07:41.160]
That's 17,000 and 20 bucks.

[02:07:41.420 --> 02:07:41.820]
All right.

[02:07:42.880 --> 02:07:43.680]
Okay, that's enough.

[02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:48.260]
See, I only wish.

[02:07:48.580 --> 02:07:51.200]
First of all, I wish that nobody would ever talk to me in this in the first place.

[02:07:51.340 --> 02:07:52.160]
Nobody's fault with mine.

[02:07:52.320 --> 02:07:52.840]
I take a blame.

[02:07:53.500 --> 02:07:54.060]
Old softy.

[02:07:54.260 --> 02:07:55.680]
Always get let myself get talkin' this stuff.

[02:07:56.040 --> 02:07:56.900]
We stop doin' this.

[02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:58.060]
Okay, it's a pain in the neck.

[02:07:58.660 --> 02:07:59.380]
We stop doin' it.

[02:08:01.260 --> 02:08:04.040]
And then, of course, the other reason what we would you know about,

[02:08:04.140 --> 02:08:05.620]
which I don't want to see on the year until it's all over,

[02:08:05.740 --> 02:08:07.620]
but then we can tell people why we're never doing it again.

[02:08:08.180 --> 02:08:09.000]
You know the one I'm talkin' about?

[02:08:09.700 --> 02:08:10.320]
Yeah, yeah.

[02:08:10.420 --> 02:08:10.580]
Yeah.

[02:08:12.480 --> 02:08:14.900]
At any rate, my sponsor's significant on the resume.

[02:08:14.900 --> 02:08:17.640]
We got a lot of responses in this poll today, 1145 vote.

[02:08:18.880 --> 02:08:20.340]
Don't have one, 212.

[02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:21.380]
Well, go get you one.

[02:08:22.100 --> 02:08:23.960]
Go grab one like those polygamists do, man.

[02:08:24.080 --> 02:08:24.780]
Just grab somebody.

[02:08:25.460 --> 02:08:26.280]
Have a good time with them.

[02:08:27.780 --> 02:08:28.580]
Well, I'll take a one thing.

[02:08:28.680 --> 02:08:30.300]
What was it Sunday that I went out there to woodbine?

[02:08:30.400 --> 02:08:31.600]
I had myself a very lucky and good.

[02:08:31.600 --> 02:08:32.760]
I got that hot machine, boy.

[02:08:32.860 --> 02:08:35.480]
Speaking of hot, there were some hot people out there that died.

[02:08:35.600 --> 02:08:35.920]
Wow.

[02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:37.920]
Holy moly.

[02:08:39.740 --> 02:08:40.100]
Man.

[02:08:41.080 --> 02:08:41.920]
But nevertheless.

[02:08:43.120 --> 02:08:45.740]
Don't have one, 212, a treasure to await.

[02:08:45.940 --> 02:08:47.940]
That is just, it's enough to make you want to cry.

[02:08:48.140 --> 02:08:50.100]
You know what that is so emotional and tender and touching?

[02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:51.340]
Yeah, I'm touching it.

[02:08:52.100 --> 02:08:53.220]
Sensation on 118.

[02:08:53.940 --> 02:08:54.120]
Hot.

[02:08:54.440 --> 02:08:54.900]
106.

[02:08:55.320 --> 02:08:56.260]
I hate this poll 96.

[02:08:56.760 --> 02:08:57.480]
Well, guess what?

[02:08:58.240 --> 02:09:00.480]
A pain but great in the sack, 91.

[02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:02.100]
A nag.

[02:09:04.360 --> 02:09:06.060]
Oh, geez, that wasn't cute out.

[02:09:06.120 --> 02:09:06.600]
77.

[02:09:07.400 --> 02:09:08.040]
A nag.

[02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:08.040]

[02:09:08.480 --> 02:09:08.900]
A nag.

[02:09:08.900 --> 02:09:10.240]
A nag.

[02:09:11.380 --> 02:09:12.260]
Irreplaceable 74.

[02:09:12.960 --> 02:09:13.760]
Anoying 70.

[02:09:14.100 --> 02:09:15.460]
Aging badly 56.

[02:09:16.020 --> 02:09:16.840]
Aging badly.

[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:17.700]
Looking like crap.

[02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:19.920]
A slav 27.

[02:09:20.260 --> 02:09:21.160]
Stinky 7.

[02:09:21.720 --> 02:09:22.240]
And gross.

[02:09:22.560 --> 02:09:23.340]
Still only 3.

[02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:24.320]
Thank the word for that.

[02:09:24.600 --> 02:09:30.360]
Because if somebody is like, you know, I'm sure that out of those, that first category don't have one out of those 2 and 12.

[02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:32.660]
They probably are a bunch of them that were once upon a time of time.

[02:09:32.660 --> 02:09:37.080]
So maybe somebody like in those last year or 4 categories, but they always up in a ditch to them, you know.

[02:09:37.540 --> 02:09:40.500]
They got rid of maybe they just shot them.

[02:09:40.740 --> 02:09:41.580]
Beard them somewhere.

[02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:43.640]
Maybe they put them out of the bed with the tune in the powered milk.

[02:09:46.100 --> 02:09:46.500]
56705.

[02:09:46.620 --> 02:09:49.160]
Oh, by the way, USDA rails efforts for democracy in Iran.

[02:09:50.760 --> 02:09:51.860]
Speaking of raw story.

[02:09:52.800 --> 02:09:54.800]
I sure like that raw story.

[02:09:56.280 --> 02:10:01.500]
Promoted activists inside Iran say President Bush has planned to spend tens of millions of dollars to promote democracy.

[02:10:01.500 --> 02:10:02.940]
Here is the kind of help they don't need.

[02:10:03.620 --> 02:10:09.780]
Warning that mirror announcement of the US program in dangerous human rights advocates by 10 human as American agents to Washington Post says.

[02:10:10.420 --> 02:10:20.200]
In the case that advocates fear is directly linked to Bush's announcement, the government has jailed two Iranians who traveled outside the country to attend what was built as a series of workshops on human rights, human rights.

[02:10:20.300 --> 02:10:21.200]
Oh my God.

[02:10:21.540 --> 02:10:23.620]
Two others who attended were interrogated for three days.

[02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:27.720]
The workshops conducted by groups based in the United States were held last April.

[02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:36.480]
But Iranian investigators did not some of the participants until last month about the time the Bush administration announced plans to spend $85 million to support the cause of freedom in Iran this year.

[02:10:36.780 --> 02:10:43.180]
If the US wouldn't have stuck the shot in there in the first place and kicked out most of that, we wouldn't be where we are right now in a bunch of religious notes around the country.

[02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:47.580]
The shot would have hit so far that he used to pull out people's fingernails.

[02:10:47.800 --> 02:10:50.040]
He made Sodom look like a Sunday school preacher.

[02:10:57.340 --> 02:10:57.700]
Hey.

[02:10:57.700 --> 02:11:06.400]
Our lineers in the judiciary and a stupid George Bush human rights activist Ahmad Bosti said as he waited anxiously for his wife and daughter to emerge from interrogation last week.

[02:11:07.020 --> 02:11:11.800]
When he says he wants to promote democracy in Iran, he gives money to these outside groups and more in here suffering.

[02:11:12.880 --> 02:11:27.680]
Activists here said the Bush initiative demonstrates the chasm of and separates those working inside Iran for greater freedoms, carefully calibrating the actions to merge incremental changes in a hostile system, and the more strident approach of many Iranian exiles who often have the ear of Washington policy makers or starting towards the end of the day.

[02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:34.740]
We're still in the hornets next. We'll make it a big simmiss instead of just very quietly and you know slowly but surely you know.

[02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:40.060]
No, they got to make a big simmiss. Although a good care not not care at simmiss.

[02:11:41.280 --> 02:11:44.820]
Is there any kind of I guess that I'm thinking about but looks in Google.

[02:11:45.160 --> 02:11:45.900]
So you're good in theory.

[02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:47.240]
They're not even in the same family.

[02:11:49.560 --> 02:11:50.780]
560 705 60.

[02:11:51.580 --> 02:11:52.220]
Tom 560.

[02:11:52.380 --> 02:11:53.740]
They've rising in singular wireless line.

[02:11:54.220 --> 02:11:55.880]
We're actually doing pretty good out there. What do we got 350?

[02:11:56.260 --> 02:11:56.520]
You said?

[02:11:56.820 --> 02:11:56.960]
Yeah.

[02:11:57.660 --> 02:11:59.660]
Yeah, it's not too bad. Been there less than an hour.

[02:12:00.700 --> 02:12:02.740]
I'm thinking we get another 60 we get a thousand.

[02:12:03.800 --> 02:12:04.660]
Well, you don't think we can do that?

[02:12:05.480 --> 02:12:05.900]
We could.

[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:07.960]
Hour and ten minutes. I mean, don't forget.

[02:12:08.220 --> 02:12:11.780]
I mean, they don't get there till right at noon because they don't want to miss out on those three pants or parking passes.

[02:12:13.540 --> 02:12:14.220]
WDQA and hello.

[02:12:15.540 --> 02:12:16.320]
Hi. Is this you?

[02:12:16.700 --> 02:12:17.260]
Yes, ma'am.

[02:12:17.260 --> 02:12:18.740]
Can I? Oh, you?

[02:12:19.100 --> 02:12:20.200]
You can speak to me. Yes.

[02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:22.280]
Hi, Neil. I love you.

[02:12:22.680 --> 02:12:23.180]
Well, great.

[02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:27.420]
I just wanted to say you're doing a wonderful thing for a band and pet rescue.

[02:12:27.740 --> 02:12:31.540]
I know you get discouraged but I think it's wonderful because the poor animals can't talk for themselves.

[02:12:31.980 --> 02:12:32.180]
Right.

[02:12:32.700 --> 02:12:34.880]
And when are you guys going to come over to the east side of town?

[02:12:35.760 --> 02:12:37.340]
Like where? Like to afford water down?

[02:12:37.680 --> 02:12:37.940]
Yeah.

[02:12:39.140 --> 02:12:40.940]
Well, I'm going to be on the main on Miguel.

[02:12:41.200 --> 02:12:42.020]
Well, lean on a real heavy.

[02:12:42.460 --> 02:12:44.180]
Lean on a heavy. There's a lot of people on the east side.

[02:12:44.280 --> 02:12:46.040]
We don't like going out to that west side of town.

[02:12:46.040 --> 02:12:47.100]
So I don't blame you.

[02:12:47.100 --> 02:12:47.700]
I don't blame you.

[02:12:47.700 --> 02:12:47.920]
Okay.

[02:12:48.440 --> 02:12:49.660]
Too many of them.

[02:12:49.940 --> 02:12:50.840]
Yeah, exactly.

[02:12:51.060 --> 02:12:52.840]
Two, three old parts out there.

[02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:57.940]
And you were great when Dave Caprita, those are the days.

[02:12:58.400 --> 02:12:59.200]
They really were.

[02:12:59.280 --> 02:12:59.700]
That was it.

[02:12:59.780 --> 02:13:01.300]
Never have never had that anymore.

[02:13:01.460 --> 02:13:01.900]
I'll say that.

[02:13:02.080 --> 02:13:03.840]
Classic. I wish you had those on tape.

[02:13:04.720 --> 02:13:05.400]
I wish I did.

[02:13:05.920 --> 02:13:06.180]
Yeah.

[02:13:06.260 --> 02:13:06.800]
You know what I would do?

[02:13:06.800 --> 02:13:07.900]
I just would play them every day.

[02:13:09.420 --> 02:13:10.580]
Every day is your art.

[02:13:10.760 --> 02:13:11.780]
I get to see you out there.

[02:13:12.260 --> 02:13:13.040]
I love you, Neil.

[02:13:13.420 --> 02:13:13.580]
Bye.

[02:13:14.060 --> 02:13:14.460]
Bye.

[02:13:15.360 --> 02:13:17.140]
Neil wakes me up in the morning.

[02:13:17.260 --> 02:13:17.780]
Oh, right.

[02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:19.780]
Neil wakes me up.

[02:13:19.900 --> 02:13:20.920]
Can't live in the past, though.

[02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:22.200]
You know, we have to move onward and upward.

[02:13:22.420 --> 02:13:24.580]
Especially after that civilating 30th anniversary experience.

[02:13:24.740 --> 02:13:25.460]
It was really a message.

[02:13:26.200 --> 02:13:27.060]
You know, it was a real...

[02:13:29.020 --> 02:13:30.820]
Oh, I am so stupid, man.

[02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:32.720]
It's just so what a mismanaged career.

[02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:33.540]
But I'm doing okay.

[02:13:33.720 --> 02:13:34.540]
You know, I have no complaints.

[02:13:35.120 --> 02:13:36.600]
Hank though, talk me to go into woodbind tomorrow.

[02:13:36.760 --> 02:13:37.620]
I wasn't going to go to the Thursday.

[02:13:38.100 --> 02:13:39.500]
Oh, you know, I mean to go in both days.

[02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:41.040]
Well, I got to give him all that money back for the advice.

[02:13:41.040 --> 02:13:41.380]
That's right.

[02:13:41.800 --> 02:13:44.000]
From that unscheduled trip that I did so well,

[02:13:44.780 --> 02:13:46.040]
I have no idea what...

[02:13:46.040 --> 02:13:47.760]
Because usually, you know, when you make one of those sperm

[02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:49.520]
at the moment, the decision is always a bad idea.

[02:13:50.180 --> 02:13:51.960]
But this one's here not to be a good machine, man.

[02:13:52.660 --> 02:13:54.420]
I mean, I'm sorry, a good machine, man.

[02:13:55.460 --> 02:13:56.400]
70 QAM, hello.

[02:13:56.780 --> 02:13:58.180]
I've got Charlie under my band.

[02:13:59.120 --> 02:14:00.140]
70 QAM, hello.

[02:14:02.160 --> 02:14:02.920]
QAM, hello.

[02:14:04.660 --> 02:14:05.620]
70 QAM, hello.

[02:14:08.080 --> 02:14:08.480]
QAM.

[02:14:09.060 --> 02:14:11.360]
Yeah, hi.

[02:14:11.360 --> 02:14:12.260]
Hey, George.

[02:14:14.080 --> 02:14:17.160]
I got something for these about 30 things.

[02:14:18.860 --> 02:14:21.040]
Now, you can play on the radio instead of what you got.

[02:14:21.180 --> 02:14:21.840]
That's getting kind of old.

[02:14:23.300 --> 02:14:25.480]
Get a recording of Frank Safer's Winow, man.

[02:14:26.160 --> 02:14:29.140]
And there's a cut-in, there's a piece in there that you can check that out.

[02:14:30.340 --> 02:14:31.280]
What's going to kind of old?

[02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:33.200]
How does it feel, man?

[02:14:33.880 --> 02:14:34.680]
Yeah, that's in a little lab.

[02:14:35.120 --> 02:14:35.580]
No doubt.

[02:14:35.860 --> 02:14:36.100]
No doubt.

[02:14:37.620 --> 02:14:39.120]
Number one was for a bullet space.

[02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:40.320]
Okay.

[02:14:41.400 --> 02:14:42.980]
Well, what is with these people?

[02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:44.700]
No matter what we do, they always know better.

[02:14:44.820 --> 02:14:45.540]
You know, that's right.

[02:14:45.800 --> 02:14:48.840]
Hey there, people on Bob and Brown.

[02:14:49.560 --> 02:14:52.580]
The sea on the queue is boy and down.

[02:14:53.140 --> 02:14:54.160]
My car is fast.

[02:14:54.880 --> 02:14:56.280]
My teeth is shining.

[02:14:56.720 --> 02:14:59.820]
I tell all the girls they can kiss my high nicks.

[02:14:59.860 --> 02:15:01.320]
Don't get right here.

[02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:03.100]
I'm at a famous school.

[02:15:03.740 --> 02:15:06.440]
I'm Bretton Sharp and I'm at the news.

[02:15:06.440 --> 02:15:10.220]
I got a cheerleader here once they help with my face.

[02:15:10.440 --> 02:15:13.680]
I better do all the work and maybe live out there.

[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.200]
I am the American Queen.

[02:15:17.600 --> 02:15:17.800]
Okay.

[02:15:19.140 --> 02:15:19.740]
There you go.

[02:15:19.820 --> 02:15:21.440]
Rest in peace, Frank Safer, for president.

[02:15:21.580 --> 02:15:23.060]
That's what I say in moon unit.

[02:15:24.460 --> 02:15:27.720]
Oh, so anyway, get back to that story about that kid that died, that they killed and tampered.

[02:15:27.800 --> 02:15:28.660]
They bushered and killed him.

[02:15:28.720 --> 02:15:30.060]
And they say, oh, is there a rare blood disorder?

[02:15:30.340 --> 02:15:30.340]

[02:15:30.340 --> 02:15:30.560]
Yes.

[02:15:31.460 --> 02:15:35.920]
Prosecutors confirmed today that the 14-year-old boy who was beaten and kicked by guards in a juvenile boot camp

[02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:39.200]
did not die of a blood disorder as a medical examiner initially ruled.

[02:15:39.840 --> 02:15:43.200]
But Pam Bondi, I wonder if he was keen to dig beyond or a viola Bondi.

[02:15:43.980 --> 02:15:49.760]
Pam Bondi, a spokesman for Hillsboro County State Attorney Mark Over, who was investigating the death of Martin Lee Anderson

[02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:51.160]
to climb to comment further on the case.

[02:15:51.580 --> 02:15:53.540]
I wonder if any case got the over's and under's.

[02:15:54.420 --> 02:15:56.660]
Bondi was confirming the statements of Dr. Michael Bond.

[02:15:56.820 --> 02:15:57.700]
Now, remember him from OJ?

[02:15:58.260 --> 02:15:58.580]
No.

[02:15:58.580 --> 02:15:59.800]
Yeah, you do.

[02:16:00.280 --> 02:16:06.700]
The noted pathologist who observed Anderson's like Dr. Henry Lee.

[02:16:06.900 --> 02:16:12.680]
By the way, you people lied to me that Lee's Chinese, that Henry Lee Chinese is still open for the other day of the arrest.

[02:16:12.860 --> 02:16:13.560]
When you're full of crap.

[02:16:14.200 --> 02:16:14.940]
Well, I was home.

[02:16:15.160 --> 02:16:18.880]
I was looking up a restaurant in the phone booklet for takeout or whatever.

[02:16:19.680 --> 02:16:20.580]
That place is still there.

[02:16:20.700 --> 02:16:21.640]
Henry Lee's T-house.

[02:16:21.720 --> 02:16:22.660]
Well, you know where it is.

[02:16:22.760 --> 02:16:23.020]
Mm-hmm.

[02:16:23.420 --> 02:16:23.800]
Anyway.

[02:16:24.440 --> 02:16:29.740]
He had said earlier to his A to T probably died from a beating by guards and out of blood as a medical examiner initially ruled.

[02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:39.880]
My opinion is that he died because of what you see in a video tape, said Bondi, referring to the surveillance video showing the guards kicking and punching Anderson's limp body shortly after he arrived at the Bay County Sheriff's Office boot camp.

[02:16:39.980 --> 02:16:42.200]
Anyway, fifth, he died at a hospital order the next day.

[02:16:43.280 --> 02:16:50.020]
Bondi will observe the autopsy and behalf of Anderson parents that will be several weeks before Adams can determine the exact cause that's medical examiner Dr. Bernard Adams,

[02:16:50.240 --> 02:16:52.720]
because T-shoes samples must be analyzed other evidence considered.

[02:16:53.320 --> 02:16:57.260]
Why they're considered to be one of the nation's top forensic pathologists and a real publicity grabber,

[02:16:57.460 --> 02:17:01.240]
Bondi noting the investigated thousands of deaths of people who were custody over the past 30 years.

[02:17:01.320 --> 02:17:02.220]
About 30, man.

[02:17:02.340 --> 02:17:04.040]
And that one was caused by sickle cell trade.

[02:17:04.620 --> 02:17:08.820]
I'm just glad the truth is out, so at least Mother Gina Jones, by already knew what the truth was.

[02:17:08.980 --> 02:17:10.500]
Now that the truth is out, I want justice.

[02:17:11.140 --> 02:17:12.620]
I want the guards and the nurses to be arrested.

[02:17:12.880 --> 02:17:14.300]
For justice, we go to...

[02:17:14.300 --> 02:17:16.500]
This is the new Roger.

[02:17:18.420 --> 02:17:21.000]
But it's the one to do our...

[02:17:21.800 --> 02:17:24.980]
The Taylor two rocket rollers pass their prime.

[02:17:25.060 --> 02:17:25.460]
What's happened?

[02:17:25.660 --> 02:17:27.620]
Straight out of Detroit, Roxie. This is Kid Rox.

[02:17:27.860 --> 02:17:28.200]
What's up?

[02:17:28.640 --> 02:17:29.520]
I'm Scott Stab.

[02:17:29.780 --> 02:17:31.620]
And the secret, no one knew.

[02:17:31.820 --> 02:17:34.660]
I don't spend a lot of money on videos. I don't think a lot of people realize that.

[02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:37.500]
Is it true love or something more?

[02:17:37.700 --> 02:17:38.000]
Higher.

[02:17:38.580 --> 02:17:39.160]
Right here.

[02:17:39.840 --> 02:17:43.640]
I think it turned the cameras on and you put the thought into the video and not the money.

[02:17:44.140 --> 02:17:45.700]
They call each other pet names.

[02:17:45.920 --> 02:17:46.860]
So long, Mama.

[02:17:47.520 --> 02:17:47.940]
See you back.

[02:17:48.480 --> 02:17:48.920]
Did it?

[02:17:48.920 --> 02:17:51.760]
And no one understands what these two share.

[02:17:51.860 --> 02:17:54.140]
That's when the states that start and that's when the videos are...

[02:17:54.140 --> 02:17:54.520]
Sometimes.

[02:17:55.220 --> 02:17:57.280]
The simplest things matter most.

[02:17:57.840 --> 02:17:59.880]
Play one of my songs.

[02:18:00.140 --> 02:18:01.180]
I just don't think that's necessary.

[02:18:01.480 --> 02:18:06.440]
Grammy winning singers Kid Rock and Scott Stab started broke back Roxie.

[02:18:06.560 --> 02:18:08.400]
Hey, it's good to be the cat.

[02:18:09.940 --> 02:18:11.900]
It's 1-1-560WQ.

[02:18:11.900 --> 02:18:13.060]
I'm happy Tuesday to you.

[02:18:13.480 --> 02:18:16.860]
And our total of John the Baker is 390.

[02:18:26.920 --> 02:18:29.760]
Brand and Flight, FLYTE, a student in Westland,

[02:18:29.880 --> 02:18:32.120]
High School in Westland, Oregon was recently expelled.

[02:18:32.720 --> 02:18:38.080]
For a video project he'd been assigned in class, which includes a same-sex snuggle scene.

[02:18:38.540 --> 02:18:38.960]
Uh-oh.

[02:18:39.640 --> 02:18:44.180]
His film, Broke Back High, is a gay love story based on themes from Broke Back Mountain,

[02:18:44.440 --> 02:18:45.660]
but set in the modern day high school.

[02:18:46.340 --> 02:18:49.260]
The shot above, and it's got a shot here, was the one that got him expelled.

[02:18:50.400 --> 02:18:52.540]
And it's, uh, I guess I'll give you this story.

[02:18:53.300 --> 02:18:54.060]
So I'm raw story.

[02:18:54.180 --> 02:18:55.940]
Pretty, and not really too raw.

[02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:58.260]
Flight writes on his website.

[02:18:58.400 --> 02:19:00.540]
One has to wonder if any of this would have happened at the two characters,

[02:19:00.540 --> 02:19:02.240]
not really my film, but male and female.

[02:19:02.600 --> 02:19:04.800]
We're led to believe that diversity is encouraged in schools,

[02:19:05.160 --> 02:19:08.580]
but when a 17-year-old straight kid makes a serious scale up to her and is expelled for it,

[02:19:08.780 --> 02:19:13.060]
it just begs the question of exactly what kind of policy was the administration following.

[02:19:13.940 --> 02:19:18.780]
I recall Tim Fields, one of the vice principals of my school having to think for at least a minute when asked by the office lady,

[02:19:19.160 --> 02:19:20.760]
what should I put down for the reason of withdrawal?

[02:19:21.620 --> 02:19:25.420]
If the basis of my expulsion is so unclear to them, then surely the circumstances surrounding it,

[02:19:25.620 --> 02:19:30.540]
are extremely questionable, and the grounds on which I was removed are both unfair and unexplainable.

[02:19:30.640 --> 02:19:32.560]
Let me say it again, unfair and unexplainable.

[02:19:34.280 --> 02:19:37.920]
There's a clip of Broke Back High on his website, and an area of lead comments in the support,

[02:19:37.920 --> 02:19:43.440]
according to Flight, Westland High says they'll pay for me to finish up my last term at a high school at Clackamas Community College,

[02:19:43.440 --> 02:19:46.920]
and I'll be able to walk with my high school classic graduation in 10-prong as a guest.

[02:19:47.280 --> 02:19:49.800]
Oh, Jesus, this is Inaamérica, baby.

[02:19:50.300 --> 02:19:52.320]
Fath! Fath! Fui!

[02:19:53.160 --> 02:19:55.620]
Oh, there's Kura Films. Fui! Fath!

[02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:58.400]
Anyway, let's move it along.

[02:19:59.200 --> 02:20:00.740]
So, we got, what, how much more?

[02:20:01.020 --> 02:20:01.400]
390.

[02:20:02.060 --> 02:20:04.640]
390. That's 40 bucks more than we had last time. That's pathetic.

[02:20:05.740 --> 02:20:06.640]
17,060 bucks.

[02:20:06.800 --> 02:20:10.180]
Our dreams are getting to 25 grand by 2 o'clock today, I'm going right down the turlord.

[02:20:13.360 --> 02:20:15.340]
I'm going to read it one more time, okay?

[02:20:15.640 --> 02:20:19.400]
Because I don't want to do like a little dog, get on my hind legs with my paws open here.

[02:20:19.400 --> 02:20:21.200]
Oh, please, please, I'm going to do that.

[02:20:21.300 --> 02:20:21.900]
I can do that.

[02:20:22.400 --> 02:20:25.060]
Yeah. Can you see my hind legs?

[02:20:25.660 --> 02:20:26.160]
Your boxers?

[02:20:26.380 --> 02:20:30.100]
Now, till 2 o'clock, it's on the Baker, 125.92 Pines Boulevard.

[02:20:30.260 --> 02:20:32.300]
That's the Home Depot Shopping Center, Pines in Flamingo.

[02:20:32.300 --> 02:20:34.380]
It's right there in the heart of the Universe, man.

[02:20:34.800 --> 02:20:35.420]
No excuses.

[02:20:36.020 --> 02:20:39.740]
Rurally is waiting for it with our about 30 TV and T-shirts.

[02:20:40.500 --> 02:20:43.740]
And also has a limited supply of Panther Park and Passes, the Abort, because we're P.O.D.

[02:20:43.840 --> 02:20:48.580]
and the organization ripping off the public for concerts, hockey games, curling matches,

[02:20:48.980 --> 02:20:50.760]
all of these freaking things.

[02:20:52.020 --> 02:20:53.060]
Here's some good news, though.

[02:20:54.720 --> 02:20:58.540]
Public Supermarkets, they unveil a hundred million long overdue, by the way.

[02:20:58.540 --> 02:21:02.900]
Unveil a hundred million dollar plan to install powerful backup generators and self-photo stores

[02:21:02.900 --> 02:21:07.580]
to avoid the food shortages and long lines that place stores after Hurricane Wilma.

[02:21:08.780 --> 02:21:12.680]
The Lakeland-based companies announcement also came with a plate of the region's municipalities

[02:21:12.680 --> 02:21:16.180]
speed up the permit process necessary to carry out the large-scale effort.

[02:21:16.900 --> 02:21:19.540]
With the official start of Hurricane Seasonless and three months away,

[02:21:20.040 --> 02:21:23.680]
public executives say they can't put the plan into place until the paperwork is complete

[02:21:23.680 --> 02:21:25.540]
and hope area governments won't drag their feet.

[02:21:26.260 --> 02:21:29.740]
By July, about 10 times that the slots are starting to go into the permuteials.

[02:21:30.680 --> 02:21:34.280]
By July, public suspects have a third of its stores equipped with a backup system

[02:21:34.280 --> 02:21:37.680]
including some in Broward and Palm Beach counties as long as permits are approved.

[02:21:38.600 --> 02:21:41.740]
We have a plan, so Maria Bruce, Spokeswoman for Public,

[02:21:41.880 --> 02:21:44.880]
but in order to make our plan a reality, we need all the municipalities

[02:21:44.880 --> 02:21:49.300]
to expedite their permitting process that process, get it going now, we can please get with it.

[02:21:50.240 --> 02:21:52.400]
The generators will allow the company to operate its produce,

[02:21:52.400 --> 02:21:56.540]
meet dairy and frozen food departments, which will only partially serve by the existing generator systems.

[02:21:56.940 --> 02:22:00.360]
That means that high-demand items such as ice milk, tuna and powdered milk

[02:22:00.360 --> 02:22:01.400]
would be available to customers.

[02:22:02.420 --> 02:22:03.060]
Isn't that good?

[02:22:03.620 --> 02:22:03.900]
That's great.

[02:22:04.500 --> 02:22:09.320]
The permanent 500 kilomites generators would have automated turn-on sensors along with a double-line fuel tank

[02:22:09.320 --> 02:22:12.660]
that holds a thousand gallons of diesel fuel that could keep stores operating

[02:22:12.660 --> 02:22:14.180]
even throughout prolonged power auditions.

[02:22:14.440 --> 02:22:15.220]
Well, let's hear it from public.

[02:22:15.380 --> 02:22:18.380]
It's okay, we like publics already ahead of time, and now there's one near-by-speed call.

[02:22:19.020 --> 02:22:19.460]
That's amazing.

[02:22:20.180 --> 02:22:20.540]
That's great.

[02:22:20.540 --> 02:22:25.000]
I mean, I come home whenever it was back in about a month ago,

[02:22:26.300 --> 02:22:30.260]
and come to find out there's like 45 new public stores within the 10 block radius of my house.

[02:22:30.660 --> 02:22:31.560]
Very convenient.

[02:22:33.420 --> 02:22:33.900]
So does that.

[02:22:33.900 --> 02:22:35.540]
Robertson finds radical Muslims satanic.

[02:22:36.920 --> 02:22:39.920]
Now, ordinarily, I just ignore him, but he's good for life.

[02:22:40.180 --> 02:22:40.480]
Oh, yeah.

[02:22:40.720 --> 02:22:41.060]
A little bit.

[02:22:43.160 --> 02:22:46.800]
Television Evangelist Pat Robertson said yesterday in his live news and talk program,

[02:22:46.800 --> 02:22:50.160]
the 700 Club, that Islam is not a religion of peace,

[02:22:50.540 --> 02:22:52.180]
and that radical Muslims are satanic.

[02:22:52.440 --> 02:22:54.560]
Thank God that radical Christians aren't satanic.

[02:22:56.800 --> 02:23:00.400]
Robertson's comments came after he watched a news story on his Christian broadcast and network

[02:23:00.400 --> 02:23:03.900]
about Muslim protest in Europe over the cartoon drugs of the Prophet Muhammad.

[02:23:05.380 --> 02:23:07.560]
And he ought to well up with Isaac Hayes, you know it.

[02:23:08.900 --> 02:23:09.800]
That'd be a good match.

[02:23:11.720 --> 02:23:12.460]
Yes, it would.

[02:23:12.760 --> 02:23:12.960]
Sorry.

[02:23:13.240 --> 02:23:13.800]
What a fact.

[02:23:15.020 --> 02:23:17.080]
Oh, he remarked that the outpouring of rage,

[02:23:17.220 --> 02:23:20.040]
he listened by cartoons, just shows the kind of people we're dealing with.

[02:23:20.440 --> 02:23:23.220]
These people are crazy fanatics, and I want to say it now.

[02:23:23.680 --> 02:23:25.740]
I believe it's motivated by demonic power.

[02:23:26.180 --> 02:23:28.620]
It is satanic at some where recognize what we're dealing with.

[02:23:29.020 --> 02:23:30.340]
Said Pat Robertson.

[02:23:31.680 --> 02:23:32.480]
In Norfolk.

[02:23:33.940 --> 02:23:36.160]
Robertson also said the goal of Islam, ladies and gentlemen,

[02:23:36.300 --> 02:23:37.720]
whether you like it or not is world domination.

[02:23:38.320 --> 02:23:39.940]
Thank God the Christians go on to do that.

[02:23:40.780 --> 02:23:44.400]
In a statement later Monday, Robertson said he was referring specifically to terrorists

[02:23:44.400 --> 02:23:47.180]
who want to bomb innocent people as being motivated by Satan.

[02:23:47.740 --> 02:23:50.200]
In the news story, he noted radical Muslims were shown screaming,

[02:23:50.560 --> 02:23:54.140]
may Allah bomb you, may O sound bit loud and bomb you, when a bomb agrande.

[02:23:55.320 --> 02:23:55.980]
Angel Watts.

[02:23:56.900 --> 02:24:00.440]
A Robertson's spokeswoman said the telephone review that the news segment also included comments

[02:24:00.440 --> 02:24:02.420]
from a moderate Muslim in the United Kingdom saying,

[02:24:02.820 --> 02:24:04.980]
radicals don't represent most Muslims in that country.

[02:24:06.160 --> 02:24:09.140]
Robertson's Virginia based network did not include his remarks when posted

[02:24:09.140 --> 02:24:12.360]
the program on his website, however, that this isn't was made out of concern.

[02:24:12.520 --> 02:24:15.880]
The Robertson's remarks could be misinterpreted if you out of context, Watts said.

[02:24:16.020 --> 02:24:19.400]
If he pissed off the era of street, Nicky and after his ass, which I think is a good idea.

[02:24:19.960 --> 02:24:21.820]
All those angry Muslims, go get him, boys.

[02:24:23.660 --> 02:24:25.560]
Monday's comments were similar remarks he made on his,

[02:24:25.740 --> 02:24:31.180]
oh, and by the way, speaking of this, how is there else you're on doing?

[02:24:31.840 --> 02:24:31.980]
Who?

[02:24:36.500 --> 02:24:37.540]
Oh, man.

[02:24:39.100 --> 02:24:43.500]
Robertson recently told ABC's Good Morning America that it comments off the cuff after watching news segments.

[02:24:43.820 --> 02:24:47.720]
He later told the Christian magazine world that he's being more careful in reviewing news stories

[02:24:47.720 --> 02:24:50.200]
before going on air and shooting off his big ignorant mouth.

[02:24:50.880 --> 02:24:54.480]
The Reverend Barry Lynn executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church in State

[02:24:54.480 --> 02:24:57.580]
called Robertson's new comments grossly irresponsible.

[02:24:58.160 --> 02:25:01.520]
At a time when interreligious tensions around the world are in an all-time high,

[02:25:02.040 --> 02:25:04.840]
Robertson seems to determine a throw gas on the fire Lynn said in the stomach.

[02:25:05.100 --> 02:25:06.700]
He threw a gas on it, gasoline.

[02:25:08.120 --> 02:25:10.020]
Would you rather have gasoline or a vaseline?

[02:25:11.080 --> 02:25:13.600]
Because of 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, do the thing where you're going to stick it.

[02:25:13.720 --> 02:25:18.160]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, and pound 5, 60 in the Verizon String of the wireless phone.

[02:25:18.280 --> 02:25:21.000]
We've got Guldi and to the staff, known in the revolving door spot.

[02:25:21.160 --> 02:25:22.720]
We've got Guldi and to the staff, known in the revolving door spot.

[02:25:23.580 --> 02:25:27.560]
We've got Guldi and to the staff, known in the revolving door spot.

[02:25:28.020 --> 02:25:29.020]
Neil, how you doing?

[02:25:29.360 --> 02:25:29.700]
Pretty good.

[02:25:30.360 --> 02:25:34.320]
Quite a good, if Pet Robertson's up to his tremendous knowledge in speaking.

[02:25:34.660 --> 02:25:35.580]
Lisa's consistent.

[02:25:37.360 --> 02:25:39.780]
Do you think, uh...

[02:25:39.780 --> 02:25:42.800]
No, I'm sorry, I'm getting a Pet Robertson, I get choked up.

[02:25:43.020 --> 02:25:44.760]
It gets, it touches me in a way.

[02:25:45.100 --> 02:25:45.800]
I'm getting off.

[02:25:48.020 --> 02:25:48.820]
Do I think?

[02:25:49.700 --> 02:25:49.960]
That's it.

[02:25:50.100 --> 02:25:51.020]
Okay, it chose it.

[02:25:51.560 --> 02:25:52.760]
He didn't choke up, he just choked.

[02:25:53.120 --> 02:25:54.440]
Yeah, he just, uh, just lost it.

[02:25:54.680 --> 02:25:55.360]
Total panic.

[02:25:55.840 --> 02:25:57.080]
That's okay, give it a good shot.

[02:25:57.160 --> 02:25:59.020]
Next time, maybe carry another 10 seconds.

[02:25:59.680 --> 02:26:03.780]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 in the Verizon String of the wireless line.

[02:26:03.920 --> 02:26:05.460]
I'm going to go ahead and give me a good lunch today, you know?

[02:26:06.620 --> 02:26:09.260]
I very rarely eat in restaurants because, you know, if you're a trial,

[02:26:09.420 --> 02:26:13.620]
now I want to say lose weight but just maintain the status quo like around 190-ish, which is okay.

[02:26:13.620 --> 02:26:13.840]
Okay.

[02:26:14.340 --> 02:26:15.560]
Not great, but it's okay.

[02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:18.240]
Uh, eating restaurants is not a good idea.

[02:26:18.780 --> 02:26:21.140]
Unless, of course, it's John the Baker or the Emerald Coast.

[02:26:21.920 --> 02:26:23.020]
Well, skinny people can eat there.

[02:26:24.120 --> 02:26:26.280]
But I'm excited about that sure talking though.

[02:26:26.380 --> 02:26:29.800]
You know something, if that stuff gets here, in fact, if it doesn't arrive before a month,

[02:26:29.880 --> 02:26:30.120]
where's it?

[02:26:30.320 --> 02:26:33.800]
All the comments are at amazon.com, really p.o.d about how long it took to get.

[02:26:33.900 --> 02:26:35.180]
Because it's such a great demand for it.

[02:26:36.500 --> 02:26:39.920]
But if that stuff turns out to be as miraculous as the guy who called this morning said,

[02:26:40.160 --> 02:26:42.000]
and he, you know, he's never even going to lie about it.

[02:26:43.060 --> 02:26:43.780]
Right, let's see how it's done.

[02:26:43.920 --> 02:26:46.160]
I'm going to create a sensation.

[02:26:46.160 --> 02:26:52.340]
It's going to make the whole Actions diet and bagel bites and bokeh burger,

[02:26:52.340 --> 02:26:54.000]
all that stuff, pale and red significance.

[02:26:54.440 --> 02:26:54.920]
Fish food.

[02:26:55.860 --> 02:26:57.120]
I'm telling you right now, right?

[02:26:57.660 --> 02:26:59.200]
Just be prepared for a sure-a-taki.

[02:27:00.280 --> 02:27:01.440]
A sure-a-taki attack?

[02:27:01.860 --> 02:27:02.140]
Yes.

[02:27:02.420 --> 02:27:03.240]
W-A-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:27:03.740 --> 02:27:04.400]
Hello, Neil.

[02:27:04.960 --> 02:27:05.160]
Yes.

[02:27:05.940 --> 02:27:08.780]
How did Molly Ringwad do on the poll the other day?

[02:27:09.720 --> 02:27:10.780]
W-A-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:27:11.320 --> 02:27:11.560]
Hello.

[02:27:12.340 --> 02:27:12.340]

[02:27:12.840 --> 02:27:14.000]
W-A-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:27:15.920 --> 02:27:16.640]
Q-A-M.

[02:27:18.300 --> 02:27:20.620]
Now that we've heard from Gilbert Solomon, come on, let's move ahead.

[02:27:20.760 --> 02:27:21.140]
You can do it.

[02:27:21.140 --> 02:27:22.000]
Q-A-M, hello.

[02:27:23.380 --> 02:27:24.060]
Not there.

[02:27:24.540 --> 02:27:25.980]
Or maybe it's that guy again, panicking.

[02:27:26.300 --> 02:27:27.160]
W-A-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:27:27.740 --> 02:27:28.040]
Neil.

[02:27:28.540 --> 02:27:28.920]
Yes, sir.

[02:27:29.440 --> 02:27:30.080]
Hi, sir.

[02:27:30.520 --> 02:27:30.740]
Okay.

[02:27:31.160 --> 02:27:35.460]
I wanted to thank you for bringing up that garbage and boot.

[02:27:36.560 --> 02:27:42.720]
The boot, the Betama City boot camp, when they slaughtered that little 14-year-old kid.

[02:27:43.080 --> 02:27:43.200]
Yeah.

[02:27:43.660 --> 02:27:45.340]
That's what's coming down in this world.

[02:27:45.600 --> 02:27:45.800]
Okay, great.

[02:27:45.980 --> 02:27:46.480]
Good life.

[02:27:46.480 --> 02:27:49.740]
5-6-7-0-5-60, chronic lady.

[02:27:51.060 --> 02:27:52.320]
W-A-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:27:52.920 --> 02:27:53.440]
Hello.

[02:27:53.820 --> 02:27:54.300]
I was here.

[02:27:54.400 --> 02:27:54.520]
I was here.

[02:27:54.520 --> 02:27:54.540]
I was here.

[02:27:54.540 --> 02:27:55.080]
Shell Miamon.

[02:27:55.120 --> 02:27:55.560]
Hello.

[02:27:56.100 --> 02:27:56.220]
Yes.

[02:27:56.640 --> 02:28:01.540]
I was just excited to see that the bulk of that garbage came in number two.

[02:28:03.500 --> 02:28:04.340]
Meaning what?

[02:28:05.600 --> 02:28:07.540]
How about those, though, together?

[02:28:07.760 --> 02:28:08.840]
Came in number two.

[02:28:10.720 --> 02:28:12.340]
W-A-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:28:12.340 --> 02:28:12.980]
Oh, that's a lot.

[02:28:14.900 --> 02:28:17.740]
Well, see, just like the other time, what a blessing that is.

[02:28:17.840 --> 02:28:19.020]
The great, the original one is stone.

[02:28:19.080 --> 02:28:19.520]
The super.

[02:28:19.920 --> 02:28:21.800]
Just to realize how well this thing works out for us.

[02:28:22.640 --> 02:28:26.660]
5-6-7-0-5-60, pound five, 60, and they've arrived in a singular wireless line.

[02:28:27.240 --> 02:28:28.080]
W-A-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:28:29.900 --> 02:28:30.220]
Hello.

[02:28:30.300 --> 02:28:30.540]
Marie-Cone.

[02:28:31.120 --> 02:28:31.620]
Marie-Cone.

[02:28:31.720 --> 02:28:31.940]
Marie-Cone.

[02:28:32.040 --> 02:28:33.020]
W-A-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:28:33.260 --> 02:28:34.040]
That wasn't even the real guy.

[02:28:34.180 --> 02:28:34.680]
Q-A-M.

[02:28:35.200 --> 02:28:36.040]
Hi, Shell.

[02:28:36.840 --> 02:28:37.880]
W-A-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:28:38.320 --> 02:28:39.600]
I'm in what a blessing that is.

[02:28:40.080 --> 02:28:40.780]
Q-A-M, come on.

[02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:41.300]
You can do it.

[02:28:42.300 --> 02:28:42.740]
Hello?

[02:28:43.160 --> 02:28:43.460]
Yes.

[02:28:44.640 --> 02:28:45.600]
Yeah, who is this?

[02:28:46.120 --> 02:28:46.700]
Marie-Cone.

[02:28:48.240 --> 02:28:49.500]
O.J. McDeffey here.

[02:28:50.780 --> 02:28:51.660]
Hi, perfect.

[02:28:51.960 --> 02:28:53.220]
Listen, what about that CD?

[02:28:54.160 --> 02:28:54.660]
What about it?

[02:28:56.260 --> 02:28:57.680]
How do we get the CD?

[02:28:58.400 --> 02:29:02.680]
Go online, neo-writers.com, or go to John DeBaker right now and rip off one.

[02:29:03.240 --> 02:29:05.480]
Hit Rollie over the head with a rolling pin, a rolling pin.

[02:29:07.040 --> 02:29:09.920]
Like we're making it difficult for these people to get it for crying out loud.

[02:29:09.920 --> 02:29:10.460]
It's right there.

[02:29:10.500 --> 02:29:12.860]
There's a big picture of it on our website, neo-writers.com.

[02:29:12.960 --> 02:29:14.340]
If you don't have a computer, we don't want to talk to you.

[02:29:14.460 --> 02:29:14.520]
Okay?

[02:29:14.680 --> 02:29:16.160]
We're just tearing it out of crap.

[02:29:16.820 --> 02:29:17.160]
Are we?

[02:29:17.520 --> 02:29:18.200]
Yes, we are.

[02:29:18.300 --> 02:29:22.160]
But all the respect of the Humper and even Jack Cafferty, well, I wouldn't know how to do that,

[02:29:22.240 --> 02:29:23.960]
because I don't know how to run a computer.

[02:29:24.200 --> 02:29:24.620]
Well, you know something.

[02:29:24.900 --> 02:29:28.560]
I'm tired of old funny-looking people, even though I like both of those people a lot.

[02:29:28.840 --> 02:29:30.380]
But, you know, get with it.

[02:29:30.860 --> 02:29:32.040]
And here's that Kira Phillips.

[02:29:35.780 --> 02:29:36.500]
Oh, man.

[02:29:37.780 --> 02:29:43.680]
Her first and Dana Bachel right behind, right in her behind, just like a bag set, bitch.

[02:29:44.700 --> 02:29:46.060]
Little tiny shrunken head.

[02:29:46.200 --> 02:29:48.340]
Am I exaggerating or not?

[02:29:48.580 --> 02:29:48.820]
No.

[02:29:49.340 --> 02:29:53.460]
She got like a little shrunken head and she's got the senior wences like the funny mouth

[02:29:53.460 --> 02:29:55.720]
with the phony lips you're used to doing the fingers.

[02:29:55.980 --> 02:29:56.380]
That's her.

[02:29:57.020 --> 02:29:58.280]
She doesn't belong in her man.

[02:29:58.400 --> 02:30:03.440]
I guess after you get to sucking up to the bush crowd that much, I guess your lips kind of like invert like that.

[02:30:03.440 --> 02:30:07.940]
Dana, which I think her name is Dana, but Blue Dawn's hit on a Dana bash.

[02:30:09.440 --> 02:30:12.620]
He's, you know, we're pleased with what he did, but he believed me.

[02:30:12.720 --> 02:30:13.600]
He's not what you think he is.

[02:30:13.740 --> 02:30:16.860]
Trust me, because you're just being introduced now, okay?

[02:30:17.520 --> 02:30:19.860]
I've got a lot of sins to make up for.

[02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.220]
A lot of men's to make.

[02:30:22.440 --> 02:30:23.040]
Maybe he's a total.

[02:30:23.660 --> 02:30:25.340]
Yeah, well, I've got a lot of men's to make too.

[02:30:26.740 --> 02:30:28.300]
13 past 1 a.k.u.a.m.

[02:30:28.380 --> 02:30:29.560]
Hey, can you run QAM?

[02:30:29.560 --> 02:30:34.540]
We don't have any national guards there because they're all fighting a war in Iraq right now.

[02:30:34.640 --> 02:30:35.460]
Not the National Guard.

[02:30:36.560 --> 02:30:36.820]
Pardon?

[02:30:37.040 --> 02:30:37.960]
Not the National Guard.

[02:30:38.080 --> 02:30:39.180]
No National Guard in Iraq?

[02:30:39.700 --> 02:30:41.020]
No, there's no National Guard.

[02:30:41.240 --> 02:30:41.360]
No.

[02:30:43.780 --> 02:30:44.300]
Absolutely.

[02:30:47.440 --> 02:30:48.460]
Don't, don't, don't go.

[02:30:50.820 --> 02:30:53.600]
Well, I know my sister all my life.

[02:30:55.480 --> 02:30:57.560]
That is why she's now my wife.

[02:30:59.120 --> 02:31:01.400]
And I think my son may know it's true.

[02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:04.400]
He's my nephew too.

[02:31:07.160 --> 02:31:09.300]
Well, my daddy is my uncle.

[02:31:09.460 --> 02:31:11.980]
Joe, my mother is my dear Amphloid.

[02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.860]
It is very plain to see my first cousin is me.

[02:31:33.640 --> 02:31:34.800]
That's the official state son.

[02:31:34.940 --> 02:31:36.480]
We thought it was Arkansas but it's Utah.

[02:31:37.060 --> 02:31:38.220]
I discovered that after last time.

[02:31:38.300 --> 02:31:39.440]
I've never seen anything on A&E.

[02:31:40.600 --> 02:31:40.740]
Oh.

[02:31:41.220 --> 02:31:42.500]
Anyway, what we got now?

[02:31:42.640 --> 02:31:43.500]
You're going to see over 400?

[02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:44.600]
Yeah, we are.

[02:31:44.700 --> 02:31:45.460]
We're at 430.

[02:31:47.060 --> 02:31:47.620]
430 already.

[02:31:47.760 --> 02:31:48.680]
What the hell are we still doing here?

[02:31:49.900 --> 02:31:50.220]
430.

[02:31:50.360 --> 02:31:51.500]
That's 40 bucks more we had before.

[02:31:51.600 --> 02:31:52.740]
That's 17,100.

[02:31:52.900 --> 02:31:53.700]
That's a pitiful number.

[02:31:53.900 --> 02:31:55.500]
But we're at least we got over 17,000.

[02:31:56.440 --> 02:31:57.540]
430, that gives us a real shame.

[02:31:57.540 --> 02:31:58.240]
We're trying to do a thousand.

[02:31:58.440 --> 02:31:58.740]
Not.

[02:31:59.820 --> 02:32:00.380]
That's okay.

[02:32:00.700 --> 02:32:01.820]
What did we do yesterday?

[02:32:02.180 --> 02:32:02.300]
We ate some.

[02:32:03.420 --> 02:32:03.940]
I forgot.

[02:32:04.740 --> 02:32:05.600]
Yeah, it was, it was ate some.

[02:32:05.760 --> 02:32:06.360]
We went over 8.

[02:32:06.540 --> 02:32:07.760]
Well, how can we do 8 there?

[02:32:07.880 --> 02:32:08.800]
And like John the Baker there?

[02:32:08.920 --> 02:32:09.260]
We didn't know that.

[02:32:09.380 --> 02:32:10.500]
We did 805.

[02:32:10.640 --> 02:32:11.540]
I got to written down right here.

[02:32:11.860 --> 02:32:12.180]
805.

[02:32:13.160 --> 02:32:13.900]
That's not so bad.

[02:32:14.340 --> 02:32:14.740]
That's a two location.

[02:32:16.540 --> 02:32:17.260]
Let me say it again.

[02:32:17.340 --> 02:32:17.540]
We did 805.

[02:32:18.060 --> 02:32:18.720]
And one location.

[02:32:18.760 --> 02:32:20.180]
And about 5 cent at the other one.

[02:32:20.960 --> 02:32:21.700]
That was the total.

[02:32:21.860 --> 02:32:22.100]
You're right.

[02:32:22.360 --> 02:32:23.060]
That's a good excuse.

[02:32:23.460 --> 02:32:24.520]
We had two locations yesterday.

[02:32:24.920 --> 02:32:25.240]
Allegedly.

[02:32:27.180 --> 02:32:28.860]
We had to do a lot more than 430.

[02:32:28.980 --> 02:32:30.480]
I'll tell you that in the next 41 minutes.

[02:32:30.660 --> 02:32:31.720]
Or it's going to be pretty embarrassing.

[02:32:31.720 --> 02:32:33.680]
And a tremendous waste of time by roll out there.

[02:32:33.740 --> 02:32:34.280]
Let's get with it.

[02:32:34.320 --> 02:32:36.500]
John the Baker in the Home Depot shopping center.

[02:32:36.660 --> 02:32:37.480]
Pines in Flamingo.

[02:32:38.260 --> 02:32:39.460]
And you don't have to go in there and eat.

[02:32:39.560 --> 02:32:41.080]
I mean, it would be nice if you did because you love the food.

[02:32:41.080 --> 02:32:41.940]
And it's all delicious.

[02:32:42.140 --> 02:32:43.000]
But, you know, that's okay.

[02:32:43.220 --> 02:32:44.300]
We understand that you're cheap.

[02:32:44.580 --> 02:32:46.200]
Just give us a 20 bucks and cut the crad.

[02:32:47.200 --> 02:32:48.040]
And really, is there that?

[02:32:48.280 --> 02:32:49.640]
I didn't give any more pants in parking pants.

[02:32:49.820 --> 02:32:51.480]
They're not probably because we didn't supply.

[02:32:51.760 --> 02:32:51.860]
Oh, yeah.

[02:32:52.120 --> 02:32:53.220]
Oh, hey, still got lots more.

[02:32:54.220 --> 02:32:54.780]
Yes, you do.

[02:32:54.780 --> 02:32:54.940]
Yes.

[02:32:55.180 --> 02:32:55.980]
Well, there you go.

[02:32:56.120 --> 02:32:57.600]
See, it goes to show you, man.

[02:32:58.180 --> 02:32:59.720]
You people just don't want to even strike back.

[02:32:59.860 --> 02:33:00.900]
That's what about your whimsy worry.

[02:33:00.980 --> 02:33:02.020]
You talk about the Democratic Party.

[02:33:02.400 --> 02:33:03.380]
You people are like the Democrats.

[02:33:04.080 --> 02:33:05.440]
When in doubt, you just went out.

[02:33:05.880 --> 02:33:07.780]
Instead of striking back and getting even with a Panther organization.

[02:33:08.740 --> 02:33:10.240]
And like getting some pre-parking passes here,

[02:33:10.300 --> 02:33:12.180]
and I have to get ripped off during the balance of the season.

[02:33:12.360 --> 02:33:13.680]
Because nobody you're going to go anyway.

[02:33:14.020 --> 02:33:14.980]
That's the bottom line.

[02:33:15.440 --> 02:33:17.040]
If they want every game from now to the end of the season,

[02:33:17.060 --> 02:33:17.980]
you still wouldn't go.

[02:33:18.940 --> 02:33:20.120]
We love the Panther.

[02:33:20.120 --> 02:33:21.240]
Yeah, only that one year.

[02:33:21.320 --> 02:33:22.240]
That's when they love the Panthers.

[02:33:22.240 --> 02:33:25.700]
Bad wagon juppers from winning, from winning phonies.

[02:33:27.260 --> 02:33:30.460]
US post-war Iraq strategy was a mess Blair was told.

[02:33:30.660 --> 02:33:31.720]
This is in the Guardian UK.

[02:33:32.360 --> 02:33:33.840]
Yes, yes, yes.

[02:33:35.520 --> 02:33:37.620]
Senior British diplomatic and military staff

[02:33:37.620 --> 02:33:39.980]
gave Tony Blair explicit warnings three years ago

[02:33:39.980 --> 02:33:42.520]
that the US was disastrously mishandled

[02:33:42.520 --> 02:33:44.320]
the occupancy of Iraq according to leaked memos.

[02:33:44.500 --> 02:33:45.220]
They're leaking over there.

[02:33:46.580 --> 02:33:49.260]
John Sowers, Mr. Blair's envoy and Baghdad,

[02:33:49.360 --> 02:33:50.300]
the aftermath of the invasion,

[02:33:50.300 --> 02:33:52.540]
sent a series of confidential memos to Downey Street

[02:33:52.540 --> 02:33:55.500]
and May and June of 2003 cataloging US failures.

[02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.840]
With unusual frankness, he described the US post-war administration

[02:33:58.840 --> 02:34:00.460]
led by the retired general, Jake Garner.

[02:34:01.960 --> 02:34:03.660]
As an unbelievable mess and said Garner

[02:34:03.660 --> 02:34:05.460]
in his top team of 60-year-old retired generals

[02:34:05.460 --> 02:34:06.880]
were well-meaning but out of their depth.

[02:34:09.120 --> 02:34:12.040]
Now the assessment is reinforced by major general Albert Whitley,

[02:34:12.640 --> 02:34:14.440]
the most senior British officer with the US land forces.

[02:34:14.860 --> 02:34:16.660]
General Whitley, another memo late that summer,

[02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:18.580]
expressed alarm that the US British coalition

[02:34:18.580 --> 02:34:19.880]
was in danger of losing the peace.

[02:34:20.260 --> 02:34:21.500]
We may have introduced into something

[02:34:21.500 --> 02:34:23.820]
we might be inclined to regret is strategic failure of possibility.

[02:34:24.260 --> 02:34:27.740]
The answer has to be yes, he concluded yes, I.I. sir.

[02:34:29.080 --> 02:34:30.540]
The memos were obtained by Michael Gordon,

[02:34:30.540 --> 02:34:32.640]
author along with General Bernard Trainor of Cobb or two,

[02:34:32.780 --> 02:34:34.780]
the inside story of the invasion and occupation of Iraq,

[02:34:35.140 --> 02:34:37.120]
published a coincide with the third anniversary of the invasion.

[02:34:38.060 --> 02:34:40.120]
The British members identified a series of US pages

[02:34:40.120 --> 02:34:42.580]
that contained the seeds of the present insurgency energy

[02:34:42.580 --> 02:34:44.160]
that even states include.

[02:34:45.320 --> 02:34:48.240]
And this goes on in life, we're just going to read some bullet points.

[02:34:48.240 --> 02:34:50.280]
So, case in bullet points, hit the highlights.

[02:34:50.700 --> 02:34:52.960]
A lack of interest by US commander General Tommy Franks

[02:34:52.960 --> 02:34:55.700]
in the post invasion phase, the presence in the capital of the US

[02:34:55.700 --> 02:34:58.360]
third and the infantry division, which took a heavy-handed approach

[02:34:58.360 --> 02:35:01.140]
to security, squandering the initial sympathy of the Iraqis,

[02:35:01.600 --> 02:35:03.140]
vectel, the main US-evident contractor,

[02:35:03.300 --> 02:35:05.380]
moving too slowly to reconnect basic services,

[02:35:05.840 --> 02:35:07.040]
sexism, electricity, and water,

[02:35:07.580 --> 02:35:08.980]
figured a deal with health hazards,

[02:35:09.260 --> 02:35:12.080]
such as 40% of Baghdad's sewage, poor unit of the Tigris River,

[02:35:12.400 --> 02:35:13.520]
and rubbish piling up in the streets,

[02:35:13.740 --> 02:35:16.080]
and sacking many of Saddam Hussein's bath party,

[02:35:16.080 --> 02:35:18.300]
even though many of them held relatively junior posts

[02:35:18.300 --> 02:35:19.620]
and a partridge in a pair of three.

[02:35:19.700 --> 02:35:20.160]
And I like that.

[02:35:20.700 --> 02:35:21.820]
And it goes on, it's on our website.

[02:35:22.860 --> 02:35:25.340]
So, Tony Blair, nobody sold out, piece of crap.

[02:35:26.360 --> 02:35:27.240]
There's another guy.

[02:35:28.220 --> 02:35:29.440]
I thought he was like really something.

[02:35:29.560 --> 02:35:31.140]
He's something I'll write, can't see it on the ear, though.

[02:35:31.540 --> 02:35:32.220]
We're good, juiced.

[02:35:34.080 --> 02:35:35.880]
Milosevic's son says his father was killed.

[02:35:36.040 --> 02:35:36.440]
Do we care?

[02:35:36.740 --> 02:35:37.800]
Absolutely not.

[02:35:38.140 --> 02:35:39.040]
Well, from kind of glad.

[02:35:39.740 --> 02:35:40.020]
Yeah.

[02:35:40.560 --> 02:35:41.980]
And I've already read it, Slavio.

[02:35:43.760 --> 02:35:45.260]
Slavio Milosevic's son alleged today

[02:35:45.260 --> 02:35:47.280]
that his father had been killed while a UN war crime

[02:35:47.280 --> 02:35:49.600]
Slavio Milosevic said the court had been told the late sirb leader

[02:35:49.600 --> 02:35:52.900]
had regular access to unprescribed medication and booze

[02:35:53.540 --> 02:35:54.800]
sluggishly with prison cell.

[02:35:55.640 --> 02:35:58.140]
The official spoke of course on condition anonymity

[02:35:58.140 --> 02:36:01.160]
because these tribunals for confidentiality rules told the A&P

[02:36:01.160 --> 02:36:02.880]
that the units prison warden had told the court

[02:36:02.880 --> 02:36:05.040]
they could no longer guarantee Milosevic's health.

[02:36:05.740 --> 02:36:07.720]
The official said prison authorities repeatedly found

[02:36:07.720 --> 02:36:10.840]
banned material in the cell, including booze and unprescribed drugs.

[02:36:11.720 --> 02:36:14.500]
The tribunal official who has access to confidential documents

[02:36:14.500 --> 02:36:17.260]
on the locivic's medication, you said two doctors concluded

[02:36:17.260 --> 02:36:19.160]
the former sirb leader was intentionally taking drugs

[02:36:19.160 --> 02:36:21.280]
that undermine the prescribed medication for his heart.

[02:36:21.360 --> 02:36:22.260]
He wanted to go to Russia.

[02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:25.500]
He wanted to go to Siberia, been a good place for him.

[02:36:25.940 --> 02:36:26.440]
Or he'll be safe.

[02:36:27.420 --> 02:36:27.620]
Yeah.

[02:36:28.320 --> 02:36:30.540]
He can go to Louisiana Bronx and be safe, too.

[02:36:33.780 --> 02:36:36.220]
Cowell test positive for Mad Cowell disease in Alabama.

[02:36:38.920 --> 02:36:41.940]
A cow in Alabama tested positive, confirming the 30 West case

[02:36:41.940 --> 02:36:43.080]
of the brain wasting ailment.

[02:36:43.080 --> 02:36:45.240]
The cow didn't enter the food supply for people

[02:36:45.240 --> 02:36:47.860]
or animals official said the animal unable to walk was killed

[02:36:47.860 --> 02:36:49.480]
by a local vet and buried on the farm.

[02:36:49.480 --> 02:36:52.340]
That said, that is shoot the old mucow.

[02:36:53.220 --> 02:36:55.560]
We remain very confident to say, by the way, cows are just,

[02:36:55.680 --> 02:36:56.580]
I don't know, dumb.

[02:36:57.540 --> 02:36:58.260]
Well, yeah.

[02:36:58.960 --> 02:36:59.840]
I mean horses are dumb.

[02:37:00.120 --> 02:37:00.960]
I don't care what anybody says.

[02:37:00.980 --> 02:37:03.280]
I like horses to a point, but they're really dumb.

[02:37:04.280 --> 02:37:06.620]
But at least if you whistle, they will pee in all horse.

[02:37:07.160 --> 02:37:08.700]
You think a cow will pee if you whistle?

[02:37:08.820 --> 02:37:08.960]
No.

[02:37:09.540 --> 02:37:10.320]
If you don't, you ever see it?

[02:37:10.320 --> 02:37:11.240]
You ever hear of a trained cow?

[02:37:11.920 --> 02:37:12.040]
No.

[02:37:12.040 --> 02:37:13.840]
I mean trained elephants, yes.

[02:37:14.760 --> 02:37:15.840]
Trained horses, of course.

[02:37:16.840 --> 02:37:19.700]
Trained dogs, cats, pyrarchites, cockatuzes,

[02:37:19.900 --> 02:37:21.200]
minabirds, minotauras.

[02:37:21.880 --> 02:37:23.400]
But trained cow, uh-uh.

[02:37:24.320 --> 02:37:25.640]
They're really good for two things.

[02:37:26.360 --> 02:37:26.860]
One is milk.

[02:37:27.360 --> 02:37:29.280]
Although it please don't drink cow's milk, please.

[02:37:29.940 --> 02:37:32.500]
And number two is like slaughter.

[02:37:33.480 --> 02:37:34.000]
Right, meat.

[02:37:34.780 --> 02:37:35.980]
The news game is the Bush administration

[02:37:35.980 --> 02:37:38.620]
to be assured Japan, other foreign customers of American beef,

[02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:40.720]
Japan halted US beef shipments in January.

[02:37:40.720 --> 02:37:42.920]
If you're fighting, you'll cut with backbone.

[02:37:43.400 --> 02:37:45.280]
I wish the Democratic Party would eat those.

[02:37:46.780 --> 02:37:48.780]
Cuts that are eaten in the US, but not in Asia.

[02:37:50.060 --> 02:37:51.520]
And that's a bag I got news for you.

[02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:53.820]
If we're eating stuff that isn't being eaten in Asia,

[02:37:53.820 --> 02:37:54.980]
then we really got problems.

[02:37:55.160 --> 02:37:55.700]
Poor his car.

[02:37:56.200 --> 02:37:57.800]
When I went to that Chinese market,

[02:37:57.920 --> 02:37:58.920]
I didn't even put my shirt on.

[02:37:59.320 --> 02:38:01.280]
Oh, I went to the three markets.

[02:38:01.940 --> 02:38:04.120]
And they got these big tubs of all these, uh,

[02:38:06.660 --> 02:38:09.440]
lions teeth and strains of our

[02:38:09.440 --> 02:38:10.460]
tiger balls.

[02:38:10.820 --> 02:38:10.900]
Tiger balls.

[02:38:10.900 --> 02:38:10.900]

[02:38:11.760 --> 02:38:12.440]
Tiger balls.

[02:38:12.660 --> 02:38:15.200]
Tiger balls and claws and...

[02:38:15.200 --> 02:38:16.420]
A lot of pus, your re-threads.

[02:38:16.420 --> 02:38:18.200]
A lot of pus, uh, fingernails.

[02:38:18.320 --> 02:38:19.160]
Oh, man.

[02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:19.860]
What is that?

[02:38:20.820 --> 02:38:21.220]
God.

[02:38:21.680 --> 02:38:22.480]
Oh, breaking news.

[02:38:22.740 --> 02:38:23.280]
Breaking stories.

[02:38:26.480 --> 02:38:28.460]
Oh, that's not real breaking news, it's a promo.

[02:38:29.900 --> 02:38:31.020]
From Western hotels.

[02:38:31.460 --> 02:38:32.560]
Well, I didn't look like breaking news.

[02:38:32.680 --> 02:38:33.240]
It looked kind of interesting.

[02:38:33.420 --> 02:38:34.280]
I got the candles out.

[02:38:35.300 --> 02:38:36.500]
They don't got Tom Bo-Detto.

[02:38:36.660 --> 02:38:37.800]
26 past 1 a.k.u.

[02:38:37.800 --> 02:38:38.520]
I'm gilding it too.

[02:38:38.580 --> 02:38:40.420]
Don't forget the Jack Martin show at 3 o'clock.

[02:38:40.720 --> 02:38:42.540]
When we cut back after this break,

[02:38:43.520 --> 02:38:46.520]
see, this is why I just can't continue doing this thing

[02:38:46.520 --> 02:38:48.260]
every day with this fundraising thing.

[02:38:49.220 --> 02:38:50.400]
It's just got wrenching.

[02:38:50.660 --> 02:38:52.720]
Because they're not coming through anywhere near like they used to.

[02:38:52.860 --> 02:38:54.120]
Although, maybe my memory's bad.

[02:38:54.200 --> 02:38:55.000]
I don't know what we used to get.

[02:38:55.100 --> 02:38:55.880]
Is this the my word was?

[02:38:56.720 --> 02:39:00.660]
I think we're doing as good or better as we have on this station.

[02:39:01.720 --> 02:39:03.200]
Are you sure on this station?

[02:39:03.820 --> 02:39:04.320]
Because on this station,

[02:39:04.340 --> 02:39:06.800]
you can't really consider it.

[02:39:14.460 --> 02:39:15.440]
But I think it's not the only thing that I can do.

[02:39:15.440 --> 02:39:15.500]
I think it's not the only thing that I can do.

[02:39:15.500 --> 02:39:15.500]

[02:39:15.500 --> 02:39:15.500]

[02:39:15.500 --> 02:39:15.500]

[02:39:15.500 --> 02:39:15.700]
I think it's not the only thing that I can do.

[02:39:16.320 --> 02:39:17.560]
I think it's not the only thing that I can do.

[02:39:17.560 --> 02:39:19.060]
I think it's not the only thing that I can do.

[02:39:19.820 --> 02:39:22.300]
I think it's not the only thing that I can do.

[02:39:22.360 --> 02:39:22.880]
I think it's not the only thing that I can do.

[02:39:22.920 --> 02:39:24.040]
I think it's not the only thing that I can do.

[02:39:26.060 --> 02:39:28.080]
I think it's not the only thing that I can do.

[02:39:28.440 --> 02:39:31.120]
I think it's not the only thing that I can do.

[02:39:31.600 --> 02:39:36.780]
I think it's not the only thing that I can do.

[02:39:42.320 --> 02:39:49.980]
I think it's not the only thing that I can do.

[02:39:49.980 --> 02:39:49.980]

[02:39:49.980 --> 02:39:49.980]

[02:39:49.980 --> 02:39:49.980]

[02:39:49.980 --> 02:39:49.980]

[02:39:49.980 --> 02:39:49.980]

[02:39:49.980 --> 02:39:49.980]

[02:39:49.980 --> 02:39:52.120]
I think it's not the only thing that I can do.

[02:39:52.120 --> 02:39:53.960]
I think it's not the only thing that I can do.

[02:39:54.600 --> 02:39:56.440]
I think it's not the only thing that I can do.

[02:39:56.440 --> 02:39:59.460]
I think it's not the only thing that I can do.

[02:40:00.100 --> 02:40:03.900]
I think it's not the only thing that I can do.

[02:40:03.900 --> 02:40:05.080]
I think it's not the only thing that I can do.

[02:40:05.080 --> 02:40:06.760]
I think it's not the only thing that I can do.

[02:40:06.760 --> 02:40:09.320]
I don't know which have been spoken, but ever since

[02:40:09.320 --> 02:40:13.120]
school people in South-Up, held on now and I have been trying to

[02:40:13.120 --> 02:40:15.640]
spread the word that cartoons are about as real as

[02:40:15.640 --> 02:40:18.720]
world-class acid-induced, technical and dream people.

[02:40:19.280 --> 02:40:22.200]
So come visit us at Disney World Damascus.

[02:40:22.540 --> 02:40:24.020]
Where Donald Duck doesn't wear pants,

[02:40:24.220 --> 02:40:27.080]
where our women are covered, and where tomorrow land is set in

[02:40:27.660 --> 02:40:28.140]
1352.

[02:40:28.760 --> 02:40:31.160]
And for all you infidels, am I see?

[02:40:31.680 --> 02:40:32.500]
See you soon.

[02:40:33.380 --> 02:40:34.120]
Hey, why?

[02:40:34.880 --> 02:40:35.140]
Why?

[02:40:35.140 --> 02:40:36.980]
Because we hate you.

[02:40:37.080 --> 02:40:38.680]
M-O-U-S.

[02:40:39.380 --> 02:40:40.240]
Oh, crap.

[02:40:42.280 --> 02:40:44.340]
131 at 560 WQM.

[02:40:44.500 --> 02:40:46.380]
It's 115 votes on a poll today.

[02:40:46.580 --> 02:40:47.040]
A lot of votes.

[02:40:47.680 --> 02:40:48.800]
So the poll is doing well.

[02:40:48.940 --> 02:40:50.760]
I wish we were doing as well on a fundraising thing which

[02:40:50.760 --> 02:40:52.300]
we already nauseated by.

[02:40:52.960 --> 02:40:53.420]
How am we doing?

[02:40:54.240 --> 02:40:55.280]
We got to stay, pay,

[02:40:55.380 --> 02:40:56.120]
40 dollars a break.

[02:40:56.300 --> 02:40:57.100]
Now we're at 470.

[02:41:04.440 --> 02:41:05.160]
17,940.

[02:41:06.700 --> 02:41:08.200]
You know, hopes were so high,

[02:41:09.260 --> 02:41:10.420]
almost as high as George.

[02:41:11.720 --> 02:41:11.960]
Although...

[02:41:11.960 --> 02:41:13.020]
17,140.

[02:41:13.580 --> 02:41:14.120]
It's pretty weak.

[02:41:14.300 --> 02:41:15.320]
I mean, how much is the total?

[02:41:15.680 --> 02:41:16.020]
410.

[02:41:16.640 --> 02:41:17.000]
470.

[02:41:18.120 --> 02:41:18.940]
That is lame.

[02:41:20.080 --> 02:41:20.780]
But never mind.

[02:41:20.920 --> 02:41:21.820]
Well, what am I going to do about it?

[02:41:21.820 --> 02:41:22.880]
Am I going to like show a hissy fit?

[02:41:22.980 --> 02:41:23.360]
Is that it?

[02:41:23.400 --> 02:41:24.120]
A hissy fit?

[02:41:24.520 --> 02:41:25.880]
Is your program director would say?

[02:41:26.040 --> 02:41:26.920]
I'm going to show a hissy help.

[02:41:27.740 --> 02:41:28.220]
Boy.

[02:41:29.120 --> 02:41:31.660]
Hell's Angel sued Disney over trademark skull and name.

[02:41:32.520 --> 02:41:34.420]
Speaking of a...

[02:41:34.420 --> 02:41:35.540]
Mecha mouse.

[02:41:36.900 --> 02:41:39.020]
The Hell's Angel's motorcycle club is going head to head with

[02:41:39.020 --> 02:41:41.640]
Walt Disney World Company over use of their trademark skull and name,

[02:41:41.940 --> 02:41:43.260]
according to a local six news report.

[02:41:44.480 --> 02:41:48.420]
The group is suing Disney's Winnevista Motion Picture than its new movie Wild Hogs.

[02:41:48.920 --> 02:41:52.980]
In the film, John Revolta, who's still in the closet with Tom Cruise,

[02:41:53.580 --> 02:41:55.820]
Tim Allen and Martin Lawrence play middle-aged wannabe bikes,

[02:41:55.820 --> 02:41:58.300]
a biker is going to counter some of Hell's Angel's members.

[02:41:59.420 --> 02:42:01.760]
The Hell's Angels said they never approved the movies use of their name,

[02:42:01.900 --> 02:42:04.660]
or skull that shows horns, feathers and a helmet, according to the report.

[02:42:04.960 --> 02:42:05.380]
I like that.

[02:42:05.660 --> 02:42:08.220]
A big smith between the Hell's Angels and Disney of all people.

[02:42:09.100 --> 02:42:10.580]
Oh, it is your buddy Hermann Gearing.

[02:42:11.400 --> 02:42:16.360]
Three years into the operation in Iraq, I recognize that well-meaning people.

[02:42:16.520 --> 02:42:19.260]
He recognized that that tamiflu thing would make him a lot of money, man.

[02:42:19.380 --> 02:42:20.060]
Get everybody whipped up.

[02:42:20.160 --> 02:42:20.780]
Forget about Iraq.

[02:42:21.200 --> 02:42:22.100]
Worry about that bird flu.

[02:42:22.780 --> 02:42:23.540]
Get your viscene.

[02:42:23.540 --> 02:42:24.420]
You're a duct tape.

[02:42:25.060 --> 02:42:26.060]
You're powdered milk.

[02:42:26.560 --> 02:42:27.000]
You're tuna.

[02:42:27.220 --> 02:42:28.640]
And of course, you're a tamiflu.

[02:42:29.620 --> 02:42:32.620]
Even Debbie Reynolds is coming back and singing that Tammy song again.

[02:42:32.920 --> 02:42:34.460]
Just an honor of Rumsfeld's here to make a few more.

[02:42:34.540 --> 02:42:36.920]
You know, this guy is older than Methuselah.

[02:42:37.060 --> 02:42:39.940]
I don't understand what all these old coots got to steal all this money for.

[02:42:40.040 --> 02:42:40.180]
Do you?

[02:42:40.320 --> 02:42:41.100]
What's it all about?

[02:42:41.280 --> 02:42:41.520]
Exactly.

[02:42:41.880 --> 02:42:42.820]
Because they got nothing to do.

[02:42:43.040 --> 02:42:43.940]
Because something is limp.

[02:42:44.100 --> 02:42:45.100]
So this is how they compensate.

[02:42:45.320 --> 02:42:45.860]
Is that what it is?

[02:42:45.940 --> 02:42:46.280]
That's it.

[02:42:46.800 --> 02:42:47.160]
Christ.

[02:42:47.640 --> 02:42:48.900]
I thought that was Bob Dole.

[02:42:51.500 --> 02:42:51.940]
56670560.

[02:42:52.860 --> 02:42:55.380]
Tom 560 and Verizon Singular wireless line.

[02:42:55.740 --> 02:42:58.420]
Don't forget we got that big Marlon game trophy on Thursday.

[02:42:58.660 --> 02:43:00.680]
Mark that baby down right on your armpit.

[02:43:00.860 --> 02:43:02.160]
Just mark it down so you don't forget.

[02:43:02.340 --> 02:43:03.020]
We're not going to forget.

[02:43:03.760 --> 02:43:04.200]
No way.

[02:43:05.940 --> 02:43:07.060]
Nobody QAAM, hello.

[02:43:08.080 --> 02:43:09.560]
Yeah, what are you raising money for?

[02:43:10.540 --> 02:43:11.340]
For a while.

[02:43:11.740 --> 02:43:12.200]
For a while.

[02:43:12.680 --> 02:43:13.720]
Yeah, for the hell of it.

[02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:14.860]
Nobody QAAM, hello.

[02:43:15.400 --> 02:43:15.980]
Not there.

[02:43:17.580 --> 02:43:18.020]
56670560.

[02:43:18.020 --> 02:43:20.340]
I'm going to just go to the music format this last half hour.

[02:43:20.680 --> 02:43:21.980]
I'm really bummed out about this.

[02:43:22.180 --> 02:43:23.940]
See, it's got a negative impact all the way around.

[02:43:24.020 --> 02:43:26.220]
Because psychologically it's deflating to get on the air.

[02:43:26.340 --> 02:43:27.720]
Like, please won't you help us out?

[02:43:27.940 --> 02:43:28.880]
Please won't you do it.

[02:43:28.960 --> 02:43:29.920]
And they don't do it.

[02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:31.880]
No, we won't do it.

[02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:33.520]
We're not going to give you like 20 cents.

[02:43:33.760 --> 02:43:36.060]
You've been on the air for 30 years, entertaining, amusing,

[02:43:36.300 --> 02:43:37.680]
chuckling, aggravating, whatever the hell it is.

[02:43:37.880 --> 02:43:38.840]
And we will give you a penny.

[02:43:39.060 --> 02:43:39.580]
How do you like that?

[02:43:39.860 --> 02:43:40.480]
That's what we'll give you.

[02:43:40.620 --> 02:43:41.800]
We'll give it like a shot in the dark.

[02:43:42.020 --> 02:43:42.540]
That's what we'll give you.

[02:43:42.840 --> 02:43:43.820]
We'll give you the finger.

[02:43:47.500 --> 02:43:48.080]
56670560.

[02:43:48.340 --> 02:43:49.240]
Pound 5668.

[02:43:49.280 --> 02:43:51.440]
Your thoughts on the March madness?

[02:43:52.340 --> 02:43:52.920]
Careful.

[02:43:53.460 --> 02:43:54.400]
Nobody QAAM, hello.

[02:43:55.680 --> 02:43:55.940]
On the March.

[02:43:56.480 --> 02:43:57.140]
Yes, sir.

[02:43:57.540 --> 02:43:58.100]
Happy forum.

[02:43:58.560 --> 02:43:59.120]
Now back to you.

[02:43:59.660 --> 02:44:02.260]
How do I get those free hockey, tacky parking passes?

[02:44:02.960 --> 02:44:04.800]
The Eurobuy John DeVaker right now.

[02:44:05.360 --> 02:44:05.760]
Where's that?

[02:44:06.600 --> 02:44:07.140]
Too late.

[02:44:08.520 --> 02:44:09.860]
Nobody QAAM, hello.

[02:44:11.800 --> 02:44:12.380]
QAAM.

[02:44:13.980 --> 02:44:16.020]
Newer, is it to rest your radio?

[02:44:16.780 --> 02:44:17.060]
Yeah.

[02:44:17.460 --> 02:44:18.420]
It's extra-terrestrial.

[02:44:18.580 --> 02:44:19.360]
Yeah, you're out of this world.

[02:44:19.920 --> 02:44:20.620]
WQAM, hello.

[02:44:21.180 --> 02:44:23.080]
How many QAAM, hello.

[02:44:23.240 --> 02:44:23.680]
QAAM.

[02:44:23.980 --> 02:44:24.500]
Hello, Neil.

[02:44:24.980 --> 02:44:25.120]
Yes.

[02:44:25.580 --> 02:44:26.220]
Hey, how you doing?

[02:44:26.640 --> 02:44:27.000]
Oh, okay.

[02:44:27.460 --> 02:44:28.220]
Good question.

[02:44:28.760 --> 02:44:34.600]
Is the 50 you just played with I'm my sister's husband, brother, so when you got on the CV?

[02:44:35.280 --> 02:44:36.120]
I doubt it.

[02:44:36.780 --> 02:44:38.240]
How do we know what is on it?

[02:44:38.320 --> 02:44:40.780]
I mean, like it's Rick's tender and so many of us.

[02:44:40.780 --> 02:44:43.200]
You go on our website, so it's got the whole list right there.

[02:44:43.340 --> 02:44:48.060]
You click where it says view listings or whatever it says, view tracks.

[02:44:48.260 --> 02:44:49.000]
Here's how you know.

[02:44:49.340 --> 02:44:52.160]
You buy it, then you turn it around and you deal.

[02:44:52.660 --> 02:44:53.180]
No, you know what?

[02:44:53.220 --> 02:44:53.920]
They don't want to do that.

[02:44:54.180 --> 02:44:54.740]
They're not good.

[02:44:54.900 --> 02:44:56.080]
Don't you understand what they're saying?

[02:44:56.520 --> 02:44:59.380]
I'm not going to buy it unless there's a bit I like under it.

[02:44:59.640 --> 02:45:00.560]
They're all good, Jack.

[02:45:00.880 --> 02:45:01.660]
I'm not going to pedal.

[02:45:01.860 --> 02:45:03.740]
Okay, if you want it fine, I'm not playing this game.

[02:45:03.920 --> 02:45:04.100]
Okay?

[02:45:04.360 --> 02:45:05.200]
You're making a bad mistake.

[02:45:06.120 --> 02:45:07.160]
I'm not playing that game.

[02:45:07.520 --> 02:45:08.240]
You want it fine.

[02:45:08.340 --> 02:45:09.040]
You want to help us out.

[02:45:09.120 --> 02:45:09.440]
That's great.

[02:45:09.440 --> 02:45:13.180]
If you want to show like everybody it's got it so far, it's real happy with it.

[02:45:13.480 --> 02:45:14.140]
Go on our website.

[02:45:14.240 --> 02:45:17.420]
You can see right there, the listing list click where it says right there in big English letters.

[02:45:17.940 --> 02:45:21.160]
View listings, it will show all the tracks that are on there.

[02:45:22.080 --> 02:45:23.620]
And you can sit there in Peru as well.

[02:45:23.740 --> 02:45:24.460]
Let's say, I don't know.

[02:45:24.680 --> 02:45:26.360]
I want to spend 20 bucks for this or not.

[02:45:26.520 --> 02:45:29.660]
You sit there and you know, with your finger deep inside your...

[02:45:29.660 --> 02:45:29.760]
Correct.

[02:45:29.960 --> 02:45:33.280]
...the body and the male and kind of pond or not or not.

[02:45:34.340 --> 02:45:36.040]
Whatever works for you is fine with me.

[02:45:36.300 --> 02:45:36.920]
I don't care.

[02:45:38.280 --> 02:45:39.140]
WQAM, hello.

[02:45:40.640 --> 02:45:41.180]
Hey.

[02:45:41.740 --> 02:45:42.100]
Hey.

[02:45:42.660 --> 02:45:45.600]
Hey, what's the difference between my ass and your face?

[02:45:45.840 --> 02:45:46.760]
WQAM, hello.

[02:45:47.220 --> 02:45:47.680]
Nothing.

[02:45:48.880 --> 02:45:49.800]
WQAM, hello.

[02:45:51.240 --> 02:45:52.080]
Not there.

[02:45:52.260 --> 02:45:52.780]
Boy, these are good.

[02:45:52.940 --> 02:45:53.760]
WQAM, hello.

[02:45:56.060 --> 02:45:56.680]
QAM.

[02:45:57.840 --> 02:45:59.240]
Just one thing else.

[02:45:59.580 --> 02:45:59.700]
Yes.

[02:46:00.480 --> 02:46:02.640]
Hey, Neal, you still have that...

[02:46:02.640 --> 02:46:03.900]
You still have that...

[02:46:03.900 --> 02:46:04.060]
You still have that...

[02:46:04.060 --> 02:46:06.900]
I'll keep you chasing gold ballistic when you talk about it.

[02:46:06.900 --> 02:46:07.720]
How deep was off the air?

[02:46:07.780 --> 02:46:08.540]
Yeah, I still got it.

[02:46:08.700 --> 02:46:08.700]

[02:46:09.440 --> 02:46:10.100]
WQAM, hello.

[02:46:11.220 --> 02:46:11.580]
QAM.

[02:46:15.020 --> 02:46:17.900]
And now this little box is like space and truth.

[02:46:18.060 --> 02:46:19.000]
Make things even better.

[02:46:19.560 --> 02:46:21.520]
Like that little problem you were having yesterday with long distance calls.

[02:46:21.780 --> 02:46:22.120]
Look at that.

[02:46:22.280 --> 02:46:23.160]
Don't want to disconnect.

[02:46:23.340 --> 02:46:23.800]
I want to do anything.

[02:46:23.900 --> 02:46:24.420]
My little box.

[02:46:25.360 --> 02:46:26.020]
WQAM, hello.

[02:46:26.700 --> 02:46:28.120]
There's like a big delay now.

[02:46:28.480 --> 02:46:28.960]
Yeah, I know that.

[02:46:29.760 --> 02:46:30.120]
QAM.

[02:46:30.660 --> 02:46:31.020]
I know.

[02:46:31.160 --> 02:46:32.180]
Have you seen Dante's gold pepper?

[02:46:33.360 --> 02:46:34.140]
What meaning what?

[02:46:35.560 --> 02:46:36.400]
Dante's gold pepper.

[02:46:36.720 --> 02:46:37.840]
Ah, WQAM.

[02:46:37.940 --> 02:46:42.000]
See, the part of it is the very funny lines that they work on for hours and hours.

[02:46:42.360 --> 02:46:45.940]
And you wait for like one to an end of finalists that's in like that was what was supposed to be.

[02:46:45.980 --> 02:46:47.140]
By the way, he's a dolphin.

[02:46:48.280 --> 02:46:48.680]
Who cares?

[02:46:48.980 --> 02:46:49.360]
I'm just saying.

[02:46:49.680 --> 02:46:50.660]
Like I care about the dolphins.

[02:46:50.880 --> 02:46:51.780]
Is that the new deal?

[02:46:51.800 --> 02:46:52.680]
I'm supposed to care about that.

[02:46:53.380 --> 02:46:54.640]
That's going to put them over the top.

[02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:58.700]
Between Dante's gold paper, maybe paper, and the A.J. Philly is bringing him back.

[02:47:00.280 --> 02:47:03.280]
I mean, you know, what's not to like when you got a customer ride?

[02:47:04.600 --> 02:47:05.600]
Somebody QAM, not lying.

[02:47:05.720 --> 02:47:05.860]
Hello.

[02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:08.320]
QAM.

[02:47:09.040 --> 02:47:09.620]
Hey, Neal.

[02:47:10.100 --> 02:47:10.420]
Okay.

[02:47:11.340 --> 02:47:12.540]
Really quick about the city.

[02:47:12.760 --> 02:47:13.160]
I love it.

[02:47:13.860 --> 02:47:14.460]
One, two.

[02:47:14.600 --> 02:47:15.800]
I got it because it's for good cause.

[02:47:16.160 --> 02:47:17.140]
Three, I would have bought another one.

[02:47:17.240 --> 02:47:18.440]
I'm going to go to Cheat Jerk.

[02:47:18.560 --> 02:47:19.840]
That's trying to copy it.

[02:47:20.100 --> 02:47:20.300]
Yeah.

[02:47:20.420 --> 02:47:21.080]
To give it to friends.

[02:47:21.780 --> 02:47:25.700]
And four, if I have a question, I mean, there's some of the ones, I mean, there's some bits of that light.

[02:47:26.340 --> 02:47:27.180]
But I'm not on it.

[02:47:27.260 --> 02:47:27.980]
How do I get the one?

[02:47:28.100 --> 02:47:30.080]
I go to the website that you want to get.

[02:47:30.200 --> 02:47:32.320]
How do you get the ones that can't download or whatever?

[02:47:33.500 --> 02:47:34.560]
How do you get the bits?

[02:47:35.100 --> 02:47:40.300]
Yeah, this is like this one I remember when you did a couple years ago with the Frodo, from like the Lord of the Rings.

[02:47:40.540 --> 02:47:41.480]
I just can't get it.

[02:47:41.580 --> 02:47:43.020]
How do you get those that are available?

[02:47:43.760 --> 02:47:44.080]
Exactly.

[02:47:44.460 --> 02:47:44.700]
You don't.

[02:47:44.700 --> 02:47:45.060]
You don't.

[02:47:45.220 --> 02:47:45.700]
You can't.

[02:47:46.380 --> 02:47:47.640]
Five, six, do you see what I mean about that?

[02:47:47.640 --> 02:47:48.100]
I know.

[02:47:48.300 --> 02:47:48.620]
I know.

[02:47:48.740 --> 02:47:48.740]

[02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:49.920]
Oh, sorry.

[02:47:50.360 --> 02:47:51.120]
I'm so sorry.

[02:47:51.460 --> 02:47:52.540]
Thanks a lot, Duff.

[02:47:54.500 --> 02:47:57.280]
I wish if there was anything in my life I could take back.

[02:47:57.420 --> 02:47:59.140]
I would have been saying, oh, okay, you guys deal with it.

[02:47:59.320 --> 02:48:00.300]
I don't have anything to do with it.

[02:48:02.280 --> 02:48:03.960]
I'm so tired of after every break.

[02:48:04.200 --> 02:48:05.600]
And why do we have to after every break?

[02:48:05.780 --> 02:48:06.980]
When have we ever do that before?

[02:48:07.160 --> 02:48:09.380]
Well, what's the point of that just to get me more aggravated?

[02:48:09.640 --> 02:48:10.140]
Yeah, that's it.

[02:48:10.760 --> 02:48:11.400]
Simply update.

[02:48:11.640 --> 02:48:12.140]
I'm sure that.

[02:48:12.460 --> 02:48:13.840]
We don't have to do any of it.

[02:48:14.220 --> 02:48:16.960]
No, but I mean, could we do it like once every half hour and give it up there?

[02:48:17.060 --> 02:48:17.800]
And what do we expect?

[02:48:18.080 --> 02:48:22.600]
Every couple of minutes there's like a line of 400 people waiting to throw their $20 in poor rolling up there?

[02:48:23.680 --> 02:48:24.920]
Who's going away those free pants?

[02:48:25.240 --> 02:48:26.860]
How do we get the Panther parking lot?

[02:48:26.960 --> 02:48:27.540]
I just got through a tunnel.

[02:48:27.540 --> 02:48:29.040]
You like 400 times today, Schmuck.

[02:48:30.640 --> 02:48:34.460]
Trying to give the people an opportunity like we got that game with the Flyers tomorrow,

[02:48:34.500 --> 02:48:35.900]
which I'm sure a lot of people are going to want to see that.

[02:48:36.020 --> 02:48:38.240]
It's a big game, at least it could be.

[02:48:39.780 --> 02:48:42.320]
And here's a chance to get a parking pass and save you a few bucks.

[02:48:42.640 --> 02:48:44.600]
No, and the strike back and say, guess what?

[02:48:44.700 --> 02:48:46.180]
We don't want to submit to your blackmail.

[02:48:46.180 --> 02:48:46.940]
Come July 1.

[02:48:47.700 --> 02:48:49.420]
You jackasses that run this organization.

[02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:50.380]
But no.

[02:48:53.120 --> 02:48:57.280]
And it just keeps going on, on, on, on, like the drum swells.

[02:48:57.280 --> 02:48:58.240]
And it's just in a run.

[02:48:58.600 --> 02:48:59.380]
Oh, God.

[02:49:01.320 --> 02:49:02.440]
1225 votes on the pool.

[02:49:02.540 --> 02:49:05.500]
My sposter significant other is a treasure 221.

[02:49:05.780 --> 02:49:06.860]
Don't have one, 217.

[02:49:06.960 --> 02:49:07.420]
Why are you lucky?

[02:49:08.220 --> 02:49:09.220]
Sensation of 128.

[02:49:09.620 --> 02:49:10.280]
Hot, 112.

[02:49:10.720 --> 02:49:11.500]
I hate this full 101.

[02:49:12.620 --> 02:49:14.280]
A pain but great in the sack, 99.

[02:49:14.900 --> 02:49:15.800]
You're a placeable, 87.

[02:49:16.300 --> 02:49:17.500]
You see the way that's zoomed up there?

[02:49:17.620 --> 02:49:18.640]
Are you doubting Thomas?

[02:49:19.140 --> 02:49:20.100]
Yeah, I doubt Thomas.

[02:49:20.460 --> 02:49:21.260]
A nag 84.

[02:49:24.860 --> 02:49:25.980]
I'm knowing 76.

[02:49:25.980 --> 02:49:27.780]
Aging badly 58.

[02:49:27.980 --> 02:49:28.520]
What a tub.

[02:49:28.940 --> 02:49:30.060]
A slab 29.

[02:49:30.600 --> 02:49:31.660]
Stinky 8 and gross.

[02:49:31.900 --> 02:49:32.600]
Now, up to sink.

[02:49:32.860 --> 02:49:35.200]
This is Neil Rogers.

[02:49:36.320 --> 02:49:38.060]
This is my 16.

[02:49:38.580 --> 02:49:39.020]
28.

[02:49:40.220 --> 02:49:42.040]
I want to die, die, die, die.

[02:49:42.040 --> 02:49:43.740]
I want to go to the park.

[02:49:43.740 --> 02:49:43.820]
To the park.

[02:49:44.780 --> 02:49:45.740]
To the door to the door.

[02:49:45.860 --> 02:49:46.520]
To the door to the door.

[02:49:46.520 --> 02:49:47.160]
To the door to the door.

[02:49:47.480 --> 02:49:48.380]
To the door to the door.

[02:49:48.380 --> 02:49:50.380]
To the door to the door.

[02:49:50.560 --> 02:49:50.780]
To the door to the door.

[02:49:51.440 --> 02:49:53.240]
To the door to the door.

[02:49:53.380 --> 02:49:53.740]
To the door to the door.

[02:49:53.740 --> 02:49:53.980]
To the door to the door.

[02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:54.740]
To the door to the door.

[02:49:54.740 --> 02:49:55.860]
To the door to the door.

[02:50:11.140 --> 02:50:13.780]
To the door to the door.

[02:50:21.380 --> 02:50:23.260]
To the door to the door.

[02:50:23.260 --> 02:50:23.520]
To the door to the door.

[02:50:23.560 --> 02:50:23.840]
To the door to the door.

[02:50:23.840 --> 02:50:23.840]

[02:50:23.840 --> 02:50:23.840]

[02:50:23.840 --> 02:50:23.840]

[02:50:23.840 --> 02:50:23.920]
To the door to the door.

[02:50:23.920 --> 02:50:23.920]

[02:50:23.920 --> 02:50:23.920]

[02:50:23.920 --> 02:50:23.920]

[02:50:23.920 --> 02:50:23.920]

[02:50:23.920 --> 02:50:23.920]

[02:50:23.920 --> 02:50:23.920]

[02:50:23.920 --> 02:50:24.220]
To the door to the door.

[02:50:24.220 --> 02:50:25.620]
To the door to the door.

[02:50:25.620 --> 02:50:25.620]

[02:50:25.620 --> 02:50:25.620]

[02:50:25.620 --> 02:50:25.620]

[02:50:25.620 --> 02:50:25.620]

[02:50:25.620 --> 02:50:25.620]

[02:50:25.620 --> 02:50:25.820]
To the door to the door.

[02:50:25.820 --> 02:50:25.820]

[02:50:25.820 --> 02:50:25.820]

[02:50:27.320 --> 02:50:28.660]
To the door to the door.

[02:50:28.660 --> 02:50:30.920]
To the door to the door.

[02:50:30.920 --> 02:50:31.100]
To the door to the door.

[02:50:31.100 --> 02:50:32.280]
To the door to the door.

[02:50:32.320 --> 02:50:32.640]
To the door to the door.

[02:50:32.760 --> 02:50:33.080]
145.

[02:50:33.240 --> 02:50:34.400]
So they got the hint here longness

[02:50:34.400 --> 02:50:35.480]
because people were really crazy

[02:50:35.480 --> 02:50:36.700]
when they messed up the hint here.

[02:50:36.820 --> 02:50:37.960]
OK, what do we got out of bite?

[02:50:38.120 --> 02:50:38.480]
Let's go.

[02:50:39.280 --> 02:50:39.600]
510.

[02:50:41.060 --> 02:50:42.860]
I thought it was a 610 was IOD.

[02:50:43.220 --> 02:50:43.540]
510?

[02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:44.300]
That's right.

[02:50:44.400 --> 02:50:45.240]
I thought we were 560.

[02:50:45.840 --> 02:50:46.960]
Now what do we have in the last one?

[02:50:47.060 --> 02:50:49.220]
Because I'm losing 470.

[02:50:49.480 --> 02:50:50.780]
So another 40.

[02:50:51.240 --> 02:50:51.320]
Yeah.

[02:50:51.860 --> 02:50:52.580]
Well, we're consistent.

[02:50:52.740 --> 02:50:53.840]
We may not be good, but we're consistent.

[02:50:54.420 --> 02:50:55.920]
That means 17,180.

[02:50:56.200 --> 02:50:57.680]
So thanks to those people who did come by

[02:50:57.680 --> 02:50:58.280]
and helped us out.

[02:50:58.380 --> 02:50:59.480]
But the rest of you, that said,

[02:51:00.060 --> 02:51:00.880]
we're really peeled.

[02:51:01.820 --> 02:51:03.360]
Raspberry, strawberry, rhubarb.

[02:51:03.560 --> 02:51:04.380]
How about some rhubarb pie?

[02:51:04.720 --> 02:51:05.440]
Hmm, sounds good.

[02:51:05.740 --> 02:51:07.340]
I'm going to wait for my sure-at-talkie, man.

[02:51:07.340 --> 02:51:08.540]
And then I'm going to take over the world.

[02:51:08.620 --> 02:51:10.380]
I'm just going to set up a sure-at-talkie shop.

[02:51:11.960 --> 02:51:12.920]
Get a little push card.

[02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.040]
Well, no, it's not one of the biggest problems with us.

[02:51:15.200 --> 02:51:16.660]
Fat folks, I mean, what would you know about it?

[02:51:16.680 --> 02:51:18.100]
But it's that bostilla pasta, baby.

[02:51:18.340 --> 02:51:19.400]
What would I know about it?

[02:51:19.460 --> 02:51:21.900]
I struggle every single day to not be surprised.

[02:51:22.020 --> 02:51:22.020]

[02:51:22.020 --> 02:51:23.160]
Who doesn't obsessed with pasta?

[02:51:23.160 --> 02:51:24.000]
I am.

[02:51:24.260 --> 02:51:25.080]
I am, too.

[02:51:25.240 --> 02:51:25.520]
I'm obsessed with-

[02:51:25.520 --> 02:51:27.220]
I can't wait to eat pasta every day.

[02:51:27.380 --> 02:51:29.440]
I have some nice sausage and a sure-at-talkie

[02:51:29.440 --> 02:51:31.720]
that I like something new for noodles that I don't have any taste.

[02:51:32.620 --> 02:51:33.840]
With some nice low-carb sauce.

[02:51:34.160 --> 02:51:36.400]
Mmm, and some nice parmesan sprinkle on it.

[02:51:36.420 --> 02:51:37.740]
Like Steve and Mr. Ego would say.

[02:51:37.980 --> 02:51:38.720]
Parmesan cheese.

[02:51:39.220 --> 02:51:40.060]
And maybe a few peppercorns.

[02:51:40.660 --> 02:51:41.620]
Yeah, a few peppercorns.

[02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:42.620]
Shmeered on it.

[02:51:43.740 --> 02:51:46.360]
Anyway, Al Gore spent a good part of the early 90s preaching

[02:51:46.360 --> 02:51:48.860]
the promise of the Internet he became known for calling it

[02:51:48.860 --> 02:51:50.140]
the information superhighway.

[02:51:50.740 --> 02:51:51.740]
The nickname didn't last,

[02:51:51.740 --> 02:51:55.040]
but the highway analogy has re-emerged in the debate about the next generation

[02:51:55.040 --> 02:51:58.020]
of the online world with some forecasting a traffic jam.

[02:51:59.220 --> 02:52:01.160]
As the updated version of the analogy goes,

[02:52:01.400 --> 02:52:04.940]
every bit of data online web pages, music files, video is on a highway,

[02:52:05.060 --> 02:52:08.300]
moving at similar speeds to computers and mobile devices around the world.

[02:52:08.560 --> 02:52:10.080]
But what if there were an express toll lane?

[02:52:11.400 --> 02:52:14.180]
What if companies with money could pay broadband providers to have their sites

[02:52:14.180 --> 02:52:16.360]
and services move faster than everybody else's?

[02:52:17.240 --> 02:52:20.720]
Carrier, such as AT&T, said the concept is their future business model.

[02:52:20.720 --> 02:52:22.920]
Critics say a mail may well ruin the web.

[02:52:24.220 --> 02:52:26.800]
And to center the debate is the value of net neutrality.

[02:52:26.940 --> 02:52:28.900]
A principle that is guided the Internet for more than a decade.

[02:52:29.180 --> 02:52:32.140]
It states that Internet service providers can't favor any online content

[02:52:32.140 --> 02:52:34.100]
over another, unless of course it's right wing.

[02:52:34.980 --> 02:52:37.800]
Some say the concept is why the Internet is developed into such a robust

[02:52:37.800 --> 02:52:41.820]
innovative medium with so many sites online competing for the attention of web surfers.

[02:52:42.140 --> 02:52:45.000]
Net neutrality laws for David Angoliath doing more equally matched.

[02:52:45.200 --> 02:52:47.420]
But it's always a big but.

[02:52:48.060 --> 02:52:50.380]
But as more consumers switch from dial up to broadband,

[02:52:50.660 --> 02:52:53.260]
Internet uses voice to move toward transferring large amounts of data,

[02:52:53.440 --> 02:52:54.440]
such as full-length movies.

[02:52:55.420 --> 02:52:58.140]
AT&T and Verizon assert that companies such as Google and Apple

[02:52:58.140 --> 02:52:59.980]
are going to make a fortune on the backs of their networks,

[02:53:00.380 --> 02:53:01.800]
and it's time they start paying their share.

[02:53:03.120 --> 02:53:05.760]
Telecommunication companies are spending billions in upgrading their networks,

[02:53:05.920 --> 02:53:07.440]
handled the next generation of online services,

[02:53:07.920 --> 02:53:09.860]
rather than passing the cost on the consumers,

[02:53:10.240 --> 02:53:12.580]
they'd rather charge the websites taken up the most bandwidth.

[02:53:13.520 --> 02:53:16.400]
Companies offering data heavy services, such as online gaming,

[02:53:16.400 --> 02:53:20.120]
phone calls, and downloadable video could pay network providers across the country.

[02:53:20.340 --> 02:53:24.800]
They have their content prioritized, meaning that it would reach customers faster than everybody else's.

[02:53:26.140 --> 02:53:27.140]
Do you understand that?

[02:53:28.660 --> 02:53:34.180]
Yes, I do. Sorry, I was over here opening my forum package from Dave Albersdam.

[02:53:34.460 --> 02:53:36.160]
Ah, there he is.

[02:53:37.220 --> 02:53:39.320]
See, and you're still on him short. He wouldn't let you down.

[02:53:39.440 --> 02:53:41.220]
Got some sugar free vanilla hazelnut syrup.

[02:53:42.440 --> 02:53:44.500]
Got some chip. Now what kind of homenties can do some?

[02:53:45.140 --> 02:53:46.700]
Diggin' in here now. Wait a minute.

[02:53:46.980 --> 02:53:49.520]
Sure, surely not those little triangle ones, and they'll call them surely.

[02:53:49.620 --> 02:53:52.020]
They always are. And they're there. Ah, fat.

[02:53:52.960 --> 02:53:53.400]
They're here.

[02:53:53.460 --> 02:53:53.780]
You kidding me?

[02:53:54.480 --> 02:53:56.440]
I told you that. We'd go through this every year.

[02:53:56.760 --> 02:53:57.360]
Oh, giant.

[02:53:57.360 --> 02:54:00.500]
Those hands don't want those things. Nobody wants to eat that crap.

[02:54:00.800 --> 02:54:01.520]
Virginia peanuts.

[02:54:02.140 --> 02:54:03.540]
Even the Orthodox don't want those.

[02:54:04.100 --> 02:54:08.000]
Prioritized and prioritized in content may also make sure certain online services don't falter,

[02:54:08.400 --> 02:54:12.560]
as features such as digital and TV and phone will be moved online.

[02:54:12.560 --> 02:54:14.040]
Access. What is that?

[02:54:14.360 --> 02:54:19.940]
Oh, um, nuggets filled pretzel nuggets. Peanut butter filled pretzel nuggets.

[02:54:21.160 --> 02:54:26.200]
Under the present system, consumers could suffer inconsistent TV signals and choppy phone calls according to Jade Durinbaum by

[02:54:26.200 --> 02:54:29.780]
threads of current communications in Germantown, Maryland. Broadband over Powerline provider.

[02:54:30.580 --> 02:54:32.780]
I don't know. I don't even understand it.

[02:54:32.940 --> 02:54:35.980]
It goes like this. Like, you go to a lot of websites to get your stories, right?

[02:54:36.120 --> 02:54:36.260]
Yeah.

[02:54:36.700 --> 02:54:41.780]
And let's, new stories don't take a long time to download. Obviously, you click on it if you have a hot broadband.

[02:54:41.780 --> 02:54:42.640]
It clicks right there.

[02:54:43.240 --> 02:54:45.480]
But what if I wanted to watch once upon a time in America now?

[02:54:45.760 --> 02:54:51.800]
Exactly. Or let's say you wanted to watch the 9-11 loose-change video or something like that.

[02:54:52.240 --> 02:54:59.700]
Companies that pay more with the stories saying, companies that pay more will be able to deliver high-speed content to their customers

[02:54:59.700 --> 02:55:02.200]
and the companies that don't want.

[02:55:02.800 --> 02:55:06.920]
So basically, it's kind of like the FCC in reverse all over again.

[02:55:06.920 --> 02:55:12.660]
And companies with money will be able to give high-speed products to their clients and regular people like

[02:55:12.660 --> 02:55:16.920]
Capital Hill Blue or Geschmendrix, they'll have to wait and they'll have slower speed.

[02:55:17.100 --> 02:55:19.860]
So people will be dissuaded from going to those sites.

[02:55:20.400 --> 02:55:21.280]
What is in that grid?

[02:55:21.740 --> 02:55:22.680]
Is that fine, huh?

[02:55:23.340 --> 02:55:24.940]
As the rich get richer in the rest of those days.

[02:55:25.040 --> 02:55:25.440]
That's right.

[02:55:25.520 --> 02:55:32.140]
You're going to have to try to bring that to the cost of the broadband space on our website.

[02:55:32.920 --> 02:55:34.220]
Because it's starting to look like a microwave.

[02:55:34.220 --> 02:55:36.120]
Well, it's just dried cherries.

[02:55:36.600 --> 02:55:37.940]
Mmm, that sounds really good.

[02:55:38.160 --> 02:55:40.180]
And what about the Homo�x? You haven't gotten to that yet.

[02:55:40.500 --> 02:55:42.220]
There are three little triangular Homo�xings.

[02:55:43.340 --> 02:55:44.140]
Tomo�xai in here.

[02:55:46.260 --> 02:55:46.660]
Oh!

[02:55:47.080 --> 02:55:47.080]

[02:55:48.680 --> 02:55:50.060]
Those are not Homo�x.

[02:55:50.120 --> 02:55:52.620]
No, I guarantee you, forget about the villa bill.

[02:55:52.660 --> 02:55:53.280]
Either along's on.

[02:55:53.600 --> 02:55:55.640]
I guarantee that there's some bellies, some bakery around.

[02:55:55.640 --> 02:55:59.240]
Hey, three lane was the one that always sent us the nice honey glaze bread.

[02:55:59.320 --> 02:56:00.420]
Hey, three lane. That's right.

[02:56:00.420 --> 02:56:02.940]
What a memory man for the good stuff. That was fantastic.

[02:56:02.940 --> 02:56:03.920]
Three lane.

[02:56:04.140 --> 02:56:05.400]
Steve from pastry lane.

[02:56:05.480 --> 02:56:05.700]
Ooh.

[02:56:05.900 --> 02:56:06.820]
That was the very best.

[02:56:06.960 --> 02:56:11.060]
But didn't they like turn on us one day because I said all about the Ariel sure one was a big trans

[02:56:11.060 --> 02:56:11.360]
Slava?

[02:56:11.480 --> 02:56:12.320]
I don't think so.

[02:56:13.100 --> 02:56:15.580]
I only said that because I wonder whatever happened to him.

[02:56:15.800 --> 02:56:16.500]
Is he still alive?

[02:56:16.680 --> 02:56:17.320]
Does anyone here?

[02:56:17.460 --> 02:56:17.820]
I don't know.

[02:56:18.200 --> 02:56:20.040]
You know who I though is Dave Helper sent.

[02:56:20.180 --> 02:56:20.540]
Thanks Dave.

[02:56:20.780 --> 02:56:22.060]
Thanks a lot Dave, you're the best.

[02:56:22.200 --> 02:56:23.080]
I'm glad there you go.

[02:56:23.900 --> 02:56:24.020]
See?

[02:56:24.340 --> 02:56:25.400]
And you hear your son I'm sure.

[02:56:26.080 --> 02:56:27.900]
This is Neil Rogers.

[02:56:29.020 --> 02:56:32.160]
This is 516 QAO.

[02:56:39.400 --> 02:56:40.320]
What's the hell was that?

[02:56:40.440 --> 02:56:41.740]
Another stunt rejoin?

[02:56:43.020 --> 02:56:43.380]
Maybe.

[02:56:44.620 --> 02:56:45.800]
Yesterday I was rejoiced.

[02:56:45.820 --> 02:56:47.440]
He's going to the whole list of 400 names.

[02:56:47.760 --> 02:56:49.160]
And at the real fair I'm the QAO.

[02:56:49.160 --> 02:56:49.840]
I'm real quick.

[02:56:50.040 --> 02:56:50.880]
And like you know.

[02:56:51.360 --> 02:56:53.820]
And now I got to know what the hell we need the additional stuff on here.

[02:56:53.920 --> 02:56:55.380]
Let's put it over site on Josh's part.

[02:56:56.680 --> 02:56:57.560]
What do you mean by that?

[02:56:59.000 --> 02:56:59.660]
Yeah, what is that mean?

[02:57:00.940 --> 02:57:01.820]
Yeah, what's all the zami?

[02:57:01.820 --> 02:57:05.420]
You blame him Josh for it now you start like fine fault you start like point the finger.

[02:57:05.420 --> 02:57:06.840]
Just because you got the home in touch.

[02:57:09.140 --> 02:57:10.560]
We need one of your ether.

[02:57:10.760 --> 02:57:11.700]
What if you do?

[02:57:11.980 --> 02:57:12.520]
The nice knowing.

[02:57:14.260 --> 02:57:15.500]
Oh, I'm going to open your paper.

[02:57:15.900 --> 02:57:17.820]
Oh, apricot.

[02:57:18.680 --> 02:57:19.120]
My hands.

[02:57:19.220 --> 02:57:20.100]
I also have the prune.

[02:57:20.720 --> 02:57:26.540]
I was sleeping in the park just trying to take the scenes.

[02:57:26.540 --> 02:57:29.880]
I got home in the dark.

[02:57:30.260 --> 02:57:33.040]
It left me black and blue.

[02:57:33.640 --> 02:57:35.760]
I'm hurt so bad.

[02:57:36.680 --> 02:57:38.980]
I'm coughing up blood.

[02:57:39.100 --> 02:57:40.380]
I'm dying on the air.

[02:57:40.760 --> 02:57:45.880]
Why was I beaten by teenagers with clubs?

[02:57:47.140 --> 02:57:49.900]
Don't know why this happened.

[02:57:50.920 --> 02:57:53.140]
I took the most to the head.

[02:57:53.140 --> 02:57:54.980]
They took off.

[02:57:55.280 --> 02:57:56.520]
They were laughing.

[02:57:57.160 --> 02:57:59.880]
They left me here for death.

[02:58:00.600 --> 02:58:03.100]
I've got an ass.

[02:58:03.440 --> 02:58:06.100]
Would they hire drugs?

[02:58:06.700 --> 02:58:07.000]
Yes.

[02:58:07.460 --> 02:58:12.860]
Why was I beaten by teenagers with clubs?

[02:58:13.920 --> 02:58:15.960]
I'm lying here.

[02:58:17.480 --> 02:58:19.000]
Can hardly move.

[02:58:20.260 --> 02:58:25.860]
They took those baseball bat-sense ones like they grew.

[02:58:27.160 --> 02:58:30.020]
I could ask the parents why.

[02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:33.300]
They raised their kids this way.

[02:58:34.220 --> 02:58:36.900]
Lots and lots of prison time.

[02:58:37.480 --> 02:58:39.980]
Will be the price they pay.

[02:58:41.080 --> 02:58:45.960]
What then and jailed with all those other clubs?

[02:58:47.420 --> 02:58:53.600]
Why was I beaten by teenagers with clubs?

[02:58:56.520 --> 02:58:57.760]
Let me ask you something.

[02:58:57.960 --> 02:58:58.580]
Is that time here?

[02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:01.180]
Your body color is responsible for these videos.

[02:59:02.420 --> 02:59:04.400]
It would be a thanks producer.

[02:59:04.660 --> 02:59:06.100]
We made it long.

[02:59:06.380 --> 02:59:06.700]
Thanks producer.

[02:59:06.700 --> 02:59:11.460]
You know what you thought of what I'm saying?

[02:59:11.460 --> 02:59:15.080]
Why do we need a double dose?

[02:59:15.560 --> 02:59:16.900]
What do we need that for?

[02:59:17.300 --> 02:59:19.920]
First of all, the thing goes on forever in the first place.

[02:59:22.360 --> 02:59:25.480]
Every basketball game was ever born, including everybody played the game.

[02:59:25.940 --> 02:59:27.900]
Then we get a double rejoin.

[02:59:28.820 --> 02:59:32.480]
You're trying to keep the show tight and neat and clean and smooth.

[02:59:33.600 --> 02:59:34.420]
Not so smudsy.

[02:59:34.920 --> 02:59:36.520]
You feel like unclean after that happens.

[02:59:37.320 --> 02:59:38.080]
You feel unclean?

[02:59:38.640 --> 02:59:39.940]
Yes, that's because of a lot of mercy.

[02:59:39.940 --> 02:59:42.420]
No, after you have those home attacks, you'll feel unclean.

[02:59:42.420 --> 02:59:44.360]
Especially when that apricot starts getting to you.

[02:59:44.920 --> 02:59:45.200]
Wow.

[02:59:46.640 --> 02:59:47.640]
What's our final to that?

[02:59:47.720 --> 02:59:48.400]
I know it's embarrassing.

[02:59:48.580 --> 02:59:49.520]
I don't even want to talk about it.

[02:59:49.940 --> 02:59:50.880]
What did I write this down?

[02:59:51.540 --> 02:59:52.360]
What did I have on the land?

[02:59:52.980 --> 02:59:52.980]

[02:59:55.680 --> 02:59:58.020]
Which roll he's going to throw in ten bucks and make it 600.

[02:59:58.720 --> 02:59:59.100]
What a guy.

[02:59:59.240 --> 02:59:59.860]
Thanks, rollie.

[03:00:00.160 --> 03:00:00.420]
You demand.

[03:00:01.900 --> 03:00:02.940]
What are you laughing about?

[03:00:04.180 --> 03:00:04.920]
Give me half a seat.

[03:00:05.240 --> 03:00:06.880]
I think God made that up.

[03:00:08.720 --> 03:00:09.420]
Did he really?

[03:00:10.800 --> 03:00:12.080]
I don't know what the hell we got.

[03:00:12.280 --> 03:00:12.660]
I have no idea.

[03:00:12.780 --> 03:00:13.640]
What do we get 590?

[03:00:13.940 --> 03:00:14.300]
590.

[03:00:14.960 --> 03:00:16.860]
We started with 166070.

[03:00:16.940 --> 03:00:17.640]
Let me do the math.

[03:00:17.900 --> 03:00:18.000]
Okay.

[03:00:18.640 --> 03:00:20.980]
600 is 17270.

[03:00:21.260 --> 03:00:24.660]
We'll make 20,000 by the end of the week even if Mandy Bell has to kick him to the difference.

[03:00:25.080 --> 03:00:27.540]
Of course, another thing you're forgetting about back in the day.

[03:00:27.900 --> 03:00:30.720]
Every time we get involved in one of these deals, whether it was center one,

[03:00:30.960 --> 03:00:34.160]
the Camilla's house, Van and Pat Rescue, whoever we were raising money for,

[03:00:34.860 --> 03:00:36.640]
the station would write a check.

[03:00:36.840 --> 03:00:37.220]
Remember that?

[03:00:37.660 --> 03:00:41.800]
Not basically for the money back, but I would do a Disney or Bob Green would come up with a grand.

[03:00:42.160 --> 03:00:43.220]
Everybody involved.

[03:00:43.640 --> 03:00:45.560]
I don't want to mention any personality things like that.

[03:00:45.620 --> 03:00:48.620]
I won't put the squeeze in our colleagues here on our colleagues.

[03:00:49.740 --> 03:00:50.540]
That's what I'm saying.

[03:00:50.920 --> 03:00:52.060]
Now we're out there on the limb.

[03:00:52.220 --> 03:00:55.300]
We're out there all by ourselves like an alcatraz.

[03:00:56.560 --> 03:00:57.740]
That's basically what it's all about.

[03:00:57.780 --> 03:00:58.880]
That's right out on the island.

[03:00:59.340 --> 03:01:00.580]
See you tomorrow from Alcatraz.

[03:01:00.640 --> 03:01:01.340]
Bye, bye, bye.
