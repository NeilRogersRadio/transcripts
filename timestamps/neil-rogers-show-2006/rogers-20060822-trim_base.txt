[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880]
Tehli said was how about you but Then You惜 Tromba move theautre Ok mosquito

[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.760]
Youth in the 17 ohm

[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.260]
Under?

[00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:09.740]
Based

[00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260]
No Way Jama而且 cow

[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.700]
Smell ButGresh Park

[00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.600]
I've been here man, out in the down by.

[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.180]
You know what it was man?

[00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.880]
I know wrote it down in the summer.

[00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.340]
You know what?

[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.660]
It's been a while you're looking at that out of the audience

[00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.960]
with a dozen known as my salute.

[00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.740]
You did it.

[00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.480]
Oh, somebody blew the bomb in the fire.

[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.240]
Oh, the bomb in the fire.

[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.620]
Look at that baby, don't you?

[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.600]
Oh, is that it?

[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.260]
Oh, look at that baby, don't you?

[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.720]
I don't know, it's such a dismal.

[00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.300]
Look at that fellow wigs with a world where he packed with cut-melons.

[00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.280]
Hope that toilet paper don't fit wet.

[00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.700]
Oh, you know, cut-melons is a good quality brand.

[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.540]
No wonder he's trying to save it, it's very expensive.

[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.260]
Who will be by the memorials and pack the bulkings of ball

[00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.220]
on 790s after this station and identification?

[00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.240]
Nobody went, you went and saw Miami Squad.

[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.000]
W. It's you, man.

[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.120]
Tell me, do I need you?

[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.460]
Oh!

[00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.740]
Another row, another row.

[00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.620]
Shed with power, power, power.

[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.960]
Victory, SBTC, I think he done it.

[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.800]
I think I'm the only person on the face of the globe

[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.680]
other than the prosecutor who thinks that John Mark Carr done it.

[00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.620]
I mean, is there anything else to talk about or want?

[00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.940]
No, no.

[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.280]
And you are the only one.

[00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.980]
What?

[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.940]
Who thinks that he done it?

[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.660]
I didn't do what I didn't think that at all.

[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.960]
Until I started thinking about this on the, you know,

[00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.660]
in his yearbook, he wrote SBTC, I shall be the counterer.

[00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.660]
I thought he wrote XYZPDQ.

[00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.900]
Elements, L.S.M. Lucky Strike means fine to backo.

[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.700]
L.S.M.F.T.

[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.140]
No, seriously.

[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.900]
I know.

[00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.140]
He wrote SBTC, shall be the counterer.

[00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.820]
Now, that's on the ransom note.

[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.640]
Now, obviously, he wrote in his yearbook in high school years before.

[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.040]
It would be something if he had just recently written a note and put SBTC.

[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.420]
But he wrote this years ago.

[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.740]
He wrote this yearbook.

[00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.280]
It's also possible.

[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.860]
In addition to which, if you look at this scrolling, the writing, the scribbling,

[00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.720]
in a yearbook with his handwritten, that looks very much like the ransom note,

[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.460]
which I don't know why nobody's talking about that.

[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.860]
They have an analist that was talking about it on CNN or one of the channels.

[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.160]
And don't you see similarities?

[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.040]
I do.

[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.060]
I do.

[00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.460]
Now, of course, this business about, wow, his wife said, his five-year-old wife said

[00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.600]
that he was in Alabama.

[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.400]
Five-year-olds don't have very good memory all the time.

[00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.560]
For a very good memory.

[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.600]
He's got some issues, OK?

[00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.960]
Well, he's busy digesting his duck and his prawns and his champagne.

[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.180]
So, basically, they brought him back in business class.

[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.260]
Innocent people are dying, being blown to bits all over the world.

[00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.800]
And people are worried about this fruitcake.

[00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.080]
What did I tell you the day?

[00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.820]
Fruitcake.

[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.800]
Oh, yeah.

[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.320]
I tell you that?

[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.940]
With his eyeliner.

[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.960]
Yeah.

[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.560]
Well, he's a lady.

[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.440]
He's a lady.

[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.180]
Like Tom Jones would say, he wants to be a lady.

[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.740]
We have艾魚.

[00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.380]
He has issues.

[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.340]
Yeah, we have issues, if you're out of institutions you can't kill your child.

[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.280]
And people are dying.

[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:32.520]
There are no greatest odds against us now.

[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.520]

[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.520]

[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.520]

[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.520]

[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.520]

[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.820]
Yeah, yeah, the answer.

[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.880]
That's smart.

[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.820]
It's a trucks center.

[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.160]
I think it is.

[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.160]

[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.160]

[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.160]

[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.160]

[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.160]

[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.160]

[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.720]
like his food we like chuck a lot you ever up chuck a lot yeah just lately

[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.680]
and anyway uh... so there's not a business across the street so i would be

[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.240]
surprised if one of them doesn't want a business but it's certainly not that

[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.420]
radio station joys i think started at rumor so we want to apologize for joys

[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.800]
pitch

[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.400]
he's got some real issues that's the problem

[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.760]
you know i'm saying what he said

[00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.220]
can't walk and said

[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.000]
so which memo should i read first i'd by the way sure you're bored

[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.420]
jerry for who is one of the most obnoxious people in human history i didn't

[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.420]
realize how evil he was until i saw i watched two db's over the weekend

[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.940]
one which you at the same as watching but they won't watch you might because i

[00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:15.060]
would

[00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.580]
the hunting of the president based on the new york times bestseller which i did

[00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.300]
i do have the book but i never got around reading it i read a little bit of

[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.280]
it by jokhanison and uh... whoever else

[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.880]
uh... hunting of the president that any campaign to destroy bill clinton and if

[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.200]
you do get this dbd by all means because i'm not really big on going to the

[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.980]

[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.640]

you probably are but i don't that the parents

but in this one there's a uh... about a forty five minute

[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.920]
and this is after the screening of the movie

[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.820]
and clinton comes out and talks to the audience and just is just fabulous it's

[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.720]
tremendous so if you're a clinton uh... person

[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.320]
or if you hit him like poison which is possible and you like any star which i

[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.400]
can't even imagine that

[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.540]

over there at the stadium diner

[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.940]
so we can keep saying across the street and it doesn't mean anything

[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.020]
right the right animal hospital over there

[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:13.560]

she's getting her waxy build up

[00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.740]
maybe maybe that's why waxy is across the street also

[00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:58.860]
you know what i'm saying

[00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:02.140]
yeah look at the same thing but the only thing we know about them is that

[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.020]
everybody who used to work there is working for us now get to that memo

[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:05.480]
in a minute

[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.860]

i don't know what's it i'm that i didn't use to work with uh... castinova

[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.000]
all the breakfast was worked there

[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.860]
and also to work on that show because toth was on zeta

[00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:26.200]
he was on nine forty whatever that means that they have an aversion to w i

[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.800]
and z even though those are some of the best call it is an american or

[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.160]

[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.620]
and also seven i did a ticket

[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.280]
greg lamega aka to see came in this morning is a good guy

[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.580]
he said what am i doing here next to the good question

[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.900]
you'll ask yourself that everywhere

[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.080]
and if you're going to be in a building very much

[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.220]
do like bubba did

[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.240]
if you want to survive you know do a bill clinton you know what that means

[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.060]
i don't have a couple ideas oh okay don't inhale

[00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:53.740]
i don't know where you go the entrance

[00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.660]
we've got to our former manager

[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:59.540]
it says allison terror will be joining us as executive and right let me get to

[00:09:59.540 --> 00:09:59.860]
the crow

[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.960]
think for you have one thing at a time more in chrome art is no longer working at

[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.980]
wq and this was an internal matter and there will be no further comment on

[00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:07.300]
the matter

[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.660]
says a clear and sterile i clarified this with him when it came in this morning

[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.140]
give us the butch routine

[00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.620]
and he said that was from management no more common but you can see whatever you

[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:15.960]
want

[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.500]
the only thing i would say about that is

[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.760]
uh... two things

[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.480]
evidently it had the controversy and it will affect the way wasn't getting paid

[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:27.020]
going to let lock a room and pump pump and couldn't get his uh... paycheck and

[00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.460]
of course anybody's been around this radio station any any more than a week

[00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:31.160]
should know that

[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.140]
the bsley's don't want to pay on time anyway

[00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:37.200]
all the work on the station and mad dog with that time wasn't that have a

[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:37.760]
full-time gig

[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.660]
yes bitching every time he was on here just screaming and carrying on threatening

[00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:45.000]
not to come back because he couldn't get paid by these cheap back like little

[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.300]
all of our asking for the course

[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:49.820]
crocheted no that up front but i have it only there was some kind of a spastic

[00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:50.760]
good deal that went on

[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.760]
and uh... and the other thing i would say about that is anybody with one ear

[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.820]
that works with no he didn't belong on the unit first

[00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:00.180]
big old red blowers and that yeah there you go

[00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:02.540]
yeah but a lot of your years ago little maxi build up in there

[00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:05.900]
so i'll probably surface across the street that is a course if they're still in

[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:06.040]
the

[00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.400]
okay i'll see here's the

[00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:09.180]
uh...

[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.380]
you know it was just a rumor that's all

[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.340]
joys it was just a freaking rumor that the judge court has started well i

[00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:19.720]
see he didn't start it was started rock solid and now

[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.400]
especially you know you really get to meet is the hit and run artist people are

[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.740]
all the street through up the crap and then they like a call on the bed all

[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:27.980]
i don't know nothing about that

[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:28.240]
you know

[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:28.380]
right

[00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:29.300]
you know

[00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:33.420]
if you're open up a big mouth and just stand up and be counted or land

[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:34.840]
or rock solid that's all

[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.540]
and the problem the reason we got the information scooter for maybe was just a

[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:39.240]
date that's wrong

[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.900]
the reason that it is because the one when

[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.880]
josh court is got told that by the big or there was no interpreter there to

[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:45.800]
like uh... clarify

[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.300]
and if you speak to the big or you definitely need

[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.120]
and interpret it

[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.960]
let's see now here's the one about not welcoming two new members of the qm

[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.260]
staff and here's the one about Kenny Walker joins qm and the new lineup next

[00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.060]
on the

[00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:58.060]
uh...

[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:01.920]
is

[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:02.200]
really

[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.140]
the

[00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:03.700]
the

[00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:09.820]
and it's not very

[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:10.860]
solid

[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:11.640]
the

[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:14.460]
world

[00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:15.640]
the

[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.100]
the

[00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:21.620]
the

[00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:22.360]
the

[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.240]
the

[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:30.380]
the

[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.200]
the

[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.120]
the

[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:41.320]
the

[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:41.420]
the

[00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:42.500]
the

[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:43.320]
the

[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.740]
some

[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.360]
the

[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:50.900]

[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.600]
So what does that have to do with little John Bane?

[00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:19.420]
There's a message in all of this and that is if you want to protect your little girl,

[00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:21.320]
don't dress her up like some kind of a hooker or a hooker or a hooker or a hooker.

[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.840]
Yeah, don't dress her up like Britney Spears who looks like a cow man.

[00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:30.060]
That's all he has to do with this video making around between her and K-fed.

[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.060]
She looks like she's been well fed, I'll tell you what.

[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:34.960]
Oh yeah, well she's not just pregnant, she's a cow.

[00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:39.100]
You're like maybe she makes Oprah look like Karen Carpenter on a bad day.

[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.340]
Anyway, here's the fact that says please add rust fine gold to the pool.

[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.500]
All other potential Democrats are a scum.

[00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.100]
Ooh man, definitely didn't put the SB word in it.

[00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:50.080]
That would have been really bad as in some bitch.

[00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:55.200]
Oh and speaking of so on biography channel the other day they had Meyer Lansky again.

[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:58.060]
Remember I told you I had seen that clip, you were playing.

[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.180]
No, but I gotta put this clip, Jackie Mason's the best you ever.

[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:07.620]
On the streets of heavily Jewish Miami Beach, Lansky became an elder statesman, a living legend.

[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:12.760]
The most priors, Jews in the world in Miami Beach were the holiest people to whom God is everything.

[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.620]
Even God wasn't close to my Lansky.

[00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.600]
So they saw my Lansky forget about God, the Jewish God.

[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:21.980]
They used to watch you can follow him, look if you walk down the street,

[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:26.220]
they would talk about how slow he walked how fast, then he have a dog, a cow, a horse,

[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:31.080]
that he said, don't get up, what time once I'm in this little deli down in Miami Beach.

[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.160]
And these two young boys came up with yellow because on and they were kind of looking at my

[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.620]
grandpa and I was kind of standing on the background.

[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:39.620]
And they came up with some Mr. Lansky, we'd like to get your autograph.

[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.240]
And he kind of looks down seriously and I know my grandpa, he goes, what did I do?

[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.200]
When it came to be a war.

[00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.920]
And he said, well, we figured it would be worth some money some day Mr. Lansky.

[00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:50.140]
And he said, no, sir, I don't say I'm out of grabs.

[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.960]
No, sir, I don't say I'm out of grabs, but I walked my dog on the beach at any rate.

[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:55.240]
That was his grand sum.

[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:59.100]
But the first part was your buddy, Jackie Mason, who, you know, I told you I saw a

[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:03.860]
Jackie Mason on the beach in 1956 that's almost 50 years ago.

[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:04.960]
It is 50 years ago.

[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:05.760]
Was he walking his dog?

[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.860]
It was walking you to a Myrlansky's dog.

[00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:11.740]
50 years ago, what the hell, it was an Anthony Eden Rock.

[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:12.540]
There wasn't a Eden Rock.

[00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:13.020]
I don't think.

[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.340]
What the hell was that hotel?

[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:15.600]
It was up from the Atlantic.

[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.860]
We stayed at the Atlantic Towers.

[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:17.880]
My parents were shleppers.

[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.700]
We stayed at the Atlantic Towers.

[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.840]
And this is like a block away in Norwegian occupation.

[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:27.580]
He looked and topped exactly the same then exactly the same then as he does now.

[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:28.340]
Old.

[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:29.260]
You know what I mean?

[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:29.700]
Yes.

[00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:32.460]
He became an elder statesman, a living legend.

[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:34.520]
It's the most pious Jews in the world.

[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:35.240]
Just like that.

[00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:39.860]
Anyway, that's from the Myrlansky thing on biography.

[00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:40.460]
That's great.

[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.500]
Don't watch the Charles Henry Kissinger

[00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.100]
unless you want to really know what's going on in the world.

[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:46.320]
And what does that have to do with poor little John Bene.

[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:49.300]
Here's another memo from Josh Dero.

[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:53.260]
It says, I would like to welcome two new members to the WQAM staff.

[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:57.880]
Well, I think they're the ones that start all those ivory rumors about that business across the street going under.

[00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:58.480]
They know.

[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.260]
First, Allison Turner.

[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:03.080]
I wonder if she's related to Fran Allison or June Allison.

[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.000]
I guess it depends.

[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:09.140]
Allison Turner will be joining us as executive producer for QAM and producer of the Hank Goldberg Show.

[00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:15.140]
Allison comes over after serving most recently as the program director of 790, the ticket, you know,

[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.260]
the guys across the street.

[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:21.360]
Then guys, she also has experience in working in West Palm Beach and Philadelphia as well as CBS Sports Line.

[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.420]
Second, Greg Lamega, aka toast.

[00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:26.140]
He's the toast of the town.

[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.740]
He ate my way to Solomon, but he's, you know, my grandma they used to call it, Solomon Ed Solomon.

[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:30.800]
You said that.

[00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:31.960]
She thought everybody was Jewish.

[00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:33.400]
Mickey Mendel, that he's Solomon.

[00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:33.900]
Wasn't he?

[00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:39.340]
Toasterly working as one of the producers on the Kenyans bullmore know that they've Johnson is Jewish.

[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.060]
The Kenyans bullmorning show.

[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:45.640]
He's worked for many years in the South Florida market, including the Zeta, the Zeta.

[00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:50.300]
What does that mean, clearance, including the Zeta, 940 and 790, the ticket.

[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:51.640]
Oh, I see the Zeta, the ticket.

[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:52.060]
You got it?

[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:52.640]
I got it.

[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.360]
He currently runs his own sports radio prep service.

[00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:00.200]
When he came in here, I should ask the, we were too busy, rekindling old memories,

[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.940]
but I should ask him what that means.

[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.900]
What does a sports radio prep service?

[00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:04.680]
I don't know what that means.

[00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:06.680]
In other words, I guess we need to be ready for it.

[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:10.020]
He's still booking guests for Stu Gants, is that what that means, like clearance?

[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.180]
So that's the memo number two.

[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.160]
Memo number three.

[00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:14.380]
Oh, my God.

[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.760]
Well, first before we get to that, it's too long and prondorous.

[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:20.260]
And it has to do all in part with that new lineup next Monday, August 28th.

[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.140]
I'm WQAM.

[00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.740]
Your South Florida's heritage sports radio station.

[00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:26.600]
We have no idea what that means, but clearance has come up with a great line.

[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:29.240]
Our heritage sports radio station.

[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.820]
As in, like you said, the heritage foundation.

[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.540]
916 votes on yesterday's George Pull.

[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.500]
What you had to add the rust fine gold on there, by the way?

[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:38.900]
Yes, I did.

[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:39.880]
Good, nice work.

[00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.560]
That means we got two Jews on there.

[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:43.180]
I voted for Elliott Spitzer.

[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:43.920]
Really?

[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:44.880]
Oh, yeah.

[00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.160]
He's going to be the governor of New York.

[00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:47.720]
He's going to win that hands down.

[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.580]
And he's a great guy.

[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:50.500]
He could be anybody.

[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:51.320]
He could be McCann.

[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.680]
He could be Julianne.

[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:53.100]
He's great.

[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:56.080]
I voted for how even though he's got a chance.

[00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:57.100]
I mean, still.

[00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.660]
And we'll get to that.

[00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:00.400]
And we only have 804 votes.

[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.340]
Our goal is 805 during the show.

[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:04.040]
What do you wish you had a video of?

[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.920]
George had 916 votes yesterday.

[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:08.840]
Angelina Jolie and her girlfriend, 298.

[00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:11.380]
Cheney's secret energy meeting is 181.

[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.100]
I wonder if Kenny Boyle was in there.

[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.540]
Maybe his body is still in there.

[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:15.880]
Maybe that's where they took his body.

[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.380]
Let's find out where the body is.

[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.540]
They're buried across the street.

[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.080]
OJ killing the cool and run 111.

[00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:23.620]
George Bush doing blow 100.

[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:25.420]
That's bad.

[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.900]
Although that's the one I voted for.

[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:30.860]
K-fed knocking up Britney 67.

[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.920]
Oh, please.

[00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:35.640]
Oh, after seeing that was the joke.

[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:35.660]

[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:36.400]
I voted the day.

[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.840]
Oh my God.

[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.000]
Boys, he got talent.

[00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:39.240]
No.

[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:39.940]
Or what, huh?

[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:41.780]
Cheney shooting that guy in the face.

[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:42.560]
Now, there's a good one.

[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:43.420]
He's got 25.

[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:44.220]
His body.

[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:44.820]
Oops.

[00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:45.700]
So we can see how it's done.

[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.520]
It's like all these the Israelis and the US

[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.020]
when we bomb the wedding party.

[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.100]
It's like, oops.

[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:51.720]
Sorry.

[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:54.280]
You notice why we fight?

[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.580]
The thing about the, they keep showing

[00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:57.180]
that the Pope were over and over again about the first.

[00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:57.720]
What is it?

[00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:58.080]
The first?

[00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:01.160]
I should have written it down in the early part of the,

[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.260]
a racquetack.

[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.500]
There's a many different precision bombings we made.

[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:06.120]
And now what?

[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.140]
What have they made their target right?

[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:07.860]
Remember that?

[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:08.340]
Yeah.

[00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:09.280]
It's just a recitesus.

[00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:10.240]
Yeah, that's true.

[00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:11.160]
Oh, look at that.

[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:11.840]
Oh, I missed it.

[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.120]
Damn it.

[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.480]
It was that little Richard thing again.

[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:14.340]
I'm a guy.

[00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:15.000]
I love that.

[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.140]
Video of the grassy Noel.

[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:21.060]
See how some of these tied together must be Noel Bush.

[00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:24.300]
The grassy Noel 32.

[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.960]
Noel is spelled K and OLL.

[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.360]
They got a couple of right letters in there.

[00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:28.080]
Nice going, draft.

[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.480]
And Eric, the grassy Noel.

[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.380]
Where are we illiterate on the show or what?

[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.580]
And I'm sitting here reading new stories.

[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:34.860]
What more on I am?

[00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:36.940]
Mel Gibson's drunk entire age.

[00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:39.160]
Had about third man.

[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:39.580]
Pretty votes.

[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:40.460]
I know.

[00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:41.900]
He's serving Bill Clinton.

[00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.140]
No, servicing I think is the word you were looking for.

[00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:46.180]
But left to letter out.

[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:46.680]
A couple of well.

[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.000]
Monica Lewinsky doing Bill Clinton 23.

[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:50.380]
And who now would want to see that?

[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:51.660]
Boy, she was a, yeah.

[00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:52.880]
Oh, and you know what else?

[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.560]
When you watch the hunting of the president.

[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:55.080]
Yes.

[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.100]
Now, even a graded, he may not have had the best taste in the world.

[00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:59.560]
He didn't marry a swillery after all.

[00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:02.000]
And he was doing, uh, with some wood monocleks.

[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:02.540]
She was doing him.

[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.840]
But take a look at that Paula Jones.

[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:06.140]
Oh, I have.

[00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:09.180]
There is no, there is nothing on the face of the globe.

[00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:11.260]
Even, I said, even this one.

[00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:11.540]
Yeah.

[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:12.780]
Even he wouldn't do her.

[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.520]
You need a welding mask to look.

[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:14.840]
Wow.

[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.280]
And Marilyn Monroe's last night, Neyne.

[00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:18.840]
Oh, how do you like that?

[00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:19.700]
I even look at that.

[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:20.380]
Look at that.

[00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:22.840]
That's a beautiful psychic vibe again by Louis.

[00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:23.660]
OK.

[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:24.860]
What's your emergency?

[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:28.880]
Calling for help already.

[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:29.400]
He's alright.

[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.340]
If you imagine everybody is whipped up into a frenzy.

[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:33.580]
Joyce's, but he would put them up in currants as a,

[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.500]
it was great this morning, like all the time.

[00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:36.440]
All over again.

[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.700]
Duff was in there, she would have made a little cameo.

[00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:40.580]
Troy came by, and we had toast.

[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.500]
And I'm going to, how's your breakfast from how he doing?

[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:43.900]
Oh, not here yet.

[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:44.800]
Well, why not?

[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:45.680]
We'll have to get us some.

[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:46.600]
I had my bacon already.

[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.600]
Don't forget two DVDs.

[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.660]
You must watch if you have a IQ larger than your small toe.

[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:52.000]

[00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:55.120]
The hunting of the president, the 10-year campaign to destroy Bill Clinton.

[00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:57.840]
And be sure to watch the special feature where he speaks at the end.

[00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.000]
And it's just great.

[00:21:59.180 --> 00:21:59.580]
Good stuff.

[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:04.180]
And the trials of Henry Kissinger are filmed by Alex Gibney and Eugene Jurekki.

[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.560]
Now, the only thing you'll say, well, that lunatic is on it at the Christopher Hitchens is on it.

[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:10.380]
He's not really on there all that much.

[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:13.740]
And don't get the content by getting the wrong DVD because he's also got one.

[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:14.220]
Yeah.

[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:14.760]
He's obsessed.

[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:15.860]
No, I don't want him.

[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:21.600]
And as much as I can't stand Christopher Hitchens in many areas, the fact that a matter is when it comes to Kissinger, he's got a stomach right in it.

[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:22.820]
Maybe it's just an anti-Semite.

[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.120]
That could be it.

[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:27.100]
28 past 10 at 560 W.

[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:31.100]
What's that lineup look like today is we're like winding down his old staggy lineup.

[00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:32.080]
It's doing so poorly.

[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.740]
We got courtesy to Mad Dog 4 to 630.

[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:38.340]
No Hank until, sorry, I guess Hank's done in the morning, the Humper, right?

[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:39.020]
Correct.

[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:39.760]
And he's on the...

[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.540]
He's on deck at Marlins who beat Washington.

[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:43.300]
In fact, they got two more games to go.

[00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:45.760]
So they've probably been back to within 600 or 500 again.

[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.780]
They play Washington every day. They'd be undefeated.

[00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:49.300]
Marlins on deck at 630.

[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:50.700]
How about those blue jays?

[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:53.040]
Loan and 8-0 lead last night.

[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.420]
That was really good little counter-tops that I didn't even know about.

[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:56.500]
That Josh was telling me all about.

[00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:57.160]
What's that guy's name?

[00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:57.660]
Eli Lilly.

[00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:58.400]
Ted Lilly.

[00:22:58.820 --> 00:22:59.440]
Eli Lilly.

[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:05.260]
And the manager, John Gibbon, who was aping it up in the dugout.

[00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:06.860]
They almost got into, like, came to blows.

[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.800]
Lilly couldn't figure out why the manager took him out of the game this,

[00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:12.160]
because he was getting lit up like a Christmas tree and blue and 8-0 lead.

[00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:12.780]
And they lost...

[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.740]
Or was the score at 11-9?

[00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:16.600]
Yeah, that's it. Some like that.

[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:20.580]
Marlins and Washington at 7-05 followed by the world famous Ed Kaplan show.

[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.520]
One thing about it, he came.

[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:25.100]
And the other day parts may come and go and swing and sway like Sammy K.

[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:26.880]
But Ed he K is always there.

[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.600]
Outtidied, but also as always, they're in that stoke.

[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.760]
They continue to be self-ordered as tops to guard a shop with one of the broadest,

[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.560]
one of the biggest, most amazing invents or risk-containing and outstanding, unbeatable selection.

[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:40.220]
Of over 8,000 open boxes of cigars, including Perdomo,

[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.680]
Anstin B.S.G. are Turo Fuente, Padrone, Monte Cristo, Romeo and Juliet,

[00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:46.100]
all the other top names you know and love.

[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:51.080]
And lots more including special hard-to-find and obscure cigars that you won't find like in every 7-11.

[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.460]
Buy your premium cigars for the price of seconds and stick around for a while,

[00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:58.380]
enjoy your smooth smoky stogies in their wine lounge featuring Pierre André,

[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.540]
a 100% peanut and noir, and lots of other fine wines from all around the world.

[00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:06.320]
Probably almost as exclusive as the fine wine at the John Mark Car was drinking on that jet from...

[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:06.960]
In business time.

[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:07.580]
I was in the time.

[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:08.380]
Yeah.

[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.120]
Why is everybody so whipped up about so I had a little bit of duck.

[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.680]
Duck is very fatty by the way and probably bring him an early death.

[00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:16.780]
You'll find stogies in one, that's true, and very fatty.

[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:21.780]
Stogies is at 1.16, 12 North Kendall Drive in Kendall, just a half mile east of exit 20 off the

[00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:21.920]
journey.

[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:26.700]
pleasure.

[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.360]

[00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:38.300]
give you a free cigar.

[00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:41.320]
I don't know how good it will be, but they'll give you a little something to light up.

[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.160]
And you'll wander around and probably take home a whole bunch.

[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:51.480]
That's Stogies at 1.16, 12 North Kendall Drive in Kendall, tall 305-59898-2820.

[00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:53.920]
This is Neil Rogers.

[00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:58.060]
This is 5.62 AF.

[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.840]
The bus reporter's gone.

[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.280]
Yeah, they kidnapped that.

[00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:09.520]
We're at the bus reporter's gone.

[00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:12.120]
So where in lesbian and non?

[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:16.600]
After rest of the meal comes.

[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:22.760]
If yourself too more than one, I hope they don't return.

[00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:27.440]
Trainers like them should only return.

[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:33.200]
Maybe they'll get never gone.

[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:36.660]
Or so did not see church.

[00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:39.840]
They've been hauled until they're gone.

[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.360]
This fact there as is now.

[00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:46.580]
These have ducts for boxed food space.

[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:50.100]
And why have that slug face up their face?

[00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:58.320]
And go through the satsaco and don't forget about the door.

[00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.560]
Big shots went there if you were at home.

[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:10.060]
Stealing, scrubbing, and the how they know what the ground troops know.

[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:14.060]
You see real war unfolds.

[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:16.820]
The world would be a safer place.

[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:24.180]
If you take them all away, thank you for the way.

[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.900]
You'll arrive in this case.

[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:29.980]
Oh, in other words.

[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:30.420]
You're fair.

[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.580]
1035, I was just thinking about what's the card dealership.

[00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:38.260]
Remember the time that I almost got killed and I drove while I was driving too fast up on the stadium?

[00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:40.320]
The one over here, who?

[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:41.900]
Right here in 441.

[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:42.560]
Right.

[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:43.500]
I forget.

[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.120]
I didn't, well, if we can figure is that I'm a roomie place?

[00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:47.100]
I don't think so.

[00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:48.500]
Oh, well, whatever it is.

[00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:49.180]
We'll figure it out.

[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.200]
They're good guys over there.

[00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:52.320]
They were very nice to me that day.

[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.120]
And my head was like all ballooned up and everything.

[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:55.940]
I hit my head on the day.

[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.360]
They were going goose egg.

[00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:58.540]
Yeah, on your head.

[00:26:58.540 --> 00:26:59.840]
And anyway, they were very nice to me.

[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:01.560]
And then you came by and took me to the hospital,

[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.080]
which I thought was a little over the top.

[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:03.460]
Wow.

[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:05.660]
It's better to be safe and sorry.

[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:07.240]
Those guys are across the street.

[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:08.280]
Yes, they are.

[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.620]
And they still will be around March 1st, March 2nd, March 3rd.

[00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:13.340]
They've been there a long time and they will continue being there.

[00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.740]
There's a Harley dealership across the street too.

[00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:18.820]
The Harley dealership will still be there in the eyes of March.

[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:23.140]
This is a, Josh and I were talking about this before the show,

[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.560]
before the game today, before we started game time.

[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:29.120]
While the Oakland athletics keep fighting for a playoff spot,

[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:31.400]
the Toronto Blue Jays are still fighting with each other.

[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.520]
This is according to sportsillustrated.com,

[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:34.380]
and they know they're crap.

[00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:35.640]
But it comes to sports.

[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:41.080]
In fact, I would say they're probably the heritage website source.

[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.140]
When you say that, Josh?

[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:43.040]
No.

[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.720]
But, givens had Lily said, no punches were thrown.

[00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:47.660]
We were on the verge of something regrettable happening.

[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.460]
We were yelling at each other face to face.

[00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:50.740]
Lily said, Eli Lilly.

[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:53.960]
Bobby Kilty, homeward and drove in four runs for the A's.

[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:56.380]
Yadi Yadi, who tied a Oakland record for the biggest comeback ever.

[00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:00.020]
Blue Jays hadn't ate nothing lead, but then Lily was pulled in the third inning

[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:01.740]
when the A scored seven runs.

[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:02.560]
Here's the best part.

[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:05.920]
Givens chewed out his pitcher who refused to give him the ball.

[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:07.960]
He had a yank get out of his hands in the ball too.

[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:11.740]
When Lily left the mound for the clubhouse, Gibbons followed him.

[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.560]
A team trainer ran a number of players and ran down the stairs.

[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:17.780]
Cambermen near the dugout saw Gibbons push Lily first.

[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.780]
Canadian press photographer Aaron Harris, one of a handful of photographers

[00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:24.680]
to witness the scrimmage, said Lily was waiting for Gibbons in the tunnel

[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:25.540]
into the clubhouse.

[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.440]
Gibbons just went at him, Harris said.

[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.140]
It looked like Gibbons grabbed him and they disappeared.

[00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:32.260]
Then the whole dugout empty back there was Mayhem down in the tunnel.

[00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:36.500]
Can you hear sounds like a television camera later show Gibbons in the training.

[00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.440]
Your wife, the manager, knows with a towel.

[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:42.120]
And here's the greatest line I have ever read in the history of sports.

[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.340]
He thought he should have been left in the game.

[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.480]
Gibbons said, Lily, I didn't think so.

[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:47.980]
Ha ha ha ha ha!

[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.180]
Gibbons met with Lily after the game.

[00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:51.020]
We hashed it out.

[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:52.920]
He said everything is fine right now.

[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:53.780]
Oh, where far?

[00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:56.660]
Except Lily's pitching ability was he still sucks.

[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.860]
He sucked before this happened and he still sucks.

[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.420]
He couldn't get your grandma out.

[00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:03.520]
He couldn't get my grandma out in her boat dead for a long time.

[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:04.340]
He still couldn't get them out.

[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:05.300]
I like that.

[00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:07.320]
Not a great line.

[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:07.980]
That's special.

[00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:09.800]
He thought he should have been left in the game.

[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.740]
He was getting lit up like a hunk of bush.

[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:12.880]
And he only gave up eight runs.

[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:13.500]
Right.

[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:14.180]
In the mini.

[00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:15.040]
Right.

[00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:16.340]
I think no outs too.

[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:18.900]
He only had an eight and nothing to leave.

[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:21.080]
There was only stakes to an eight of me.

[00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:22.100]
And how was stake?

[00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:25.460]
I want that duck and shrimp that Goofy guy got.

[00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:26.760]
John Mark Carr.

[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.520]
SB, what is that?

[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:29.420]
TCB?

[00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:33.300]
TCB, STCFTA.

[00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:36.200]
I shall be the contour victory.

[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:37.560]
SB, TCB.

[00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:40.640]
That might be from something literature or something.

[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:43.620]
Well, you know, the interesting part of it is though that the

[00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:47.040]
the ransom note, all the different lines in there are from different movies.

[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:49.120]
None of what they said the Ramses had ever seen.

[00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:50.100]
They weren't big movie people.

[00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:52.380]
They were still waiting to see Bambi and reruns.

[00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:53.140]
Yeah.

[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:57.640]
And most of the lines in the ransom note were for a well-known bizarre movies.

[00:29:58.580 --> 00:29:59.560]
Can't you handle that or not?

[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:00.720]
Yeah, they mentioned that.

[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.240]
You better start doing a lot more job than a homework.

[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:07.820]
Mr. Cozier is like 85 hours a day programming on this stuff and you're not catching up to it.

[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.620]
I watched right till midnight last night.

[00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:09.620]

[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.360]
Well, I figured I'm doing a show.

[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.040]
I better keep up on this crap, man.

[00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:14.600]
I know more than I want to know about that.

[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.780]
Well, believe me, you ain't heard nothing yet.

[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:17.940]
Trust me when I tell you.

[00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:19.700]
I heard the dog done it.

[00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:27.340]
Sweden State Broadcaster SVT yesterday faced ridicule for mistakenly showing a porn movie in the background of a news broadcast over the weekend.

[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.780]
You know, I read this story and put it on our website.

[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:30.520]
I was thinking to myself,

[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:34.240]
they're always bitching at not enough people, especially young people watch the news on TV.

[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:34.560]

[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:38.820]
If you're watching crap, you know, like America's Got Talent, even though we can't find any.

[00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:42.900]
If they want, if they want more people to watch the news, why can't they emulate this?

[00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:45.200]
Put some porn movies on the background.

[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.740]
Do you think that would attract a much broader audience?

[00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:48.640]
Sure would.

[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:58.060]
But the original five minute news update at midnight Saturday could not see explicitly from a Czech porn movie on a TV screen behind news anchor Peter Dalgrin.

[00:30:58.060 --> 00:30:59.320]
And this is in Stockholm, of course.

[00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:00.240]
It's a Stockholm.

[00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:07.740]
The monitor, one of many on the wall of a control room visible behind the studio, normally shows other news channels during broadcasts, kind like in network.

[00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:10.940]
Remember when he was turning on the different networks they were reporting about Howard Bio?

[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:11.480]
Yes.

[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:25.420]
But staffers who earlier in the evening had watched the sports event on cable channel Canal Plus, which often shows radio shows next rated films after midnight, had forgotten us which had backs in the news director Perry Ying, Ying, YNG, Ying.

[00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:29.400]
This is highly embarrassing and unfortunate Ying said it must not happen again.

[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:34.380]
Well, a producer quickly spotted the sex scenes and ran into the control room and turned off the monitoring set.

[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:38.560]
He said there have been no complaints from viewers about the misrepresent, but enormous interest from the media.

[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:46.400]
Swedish tabloids yesterday poked fun with the steamy broadcast jokingly changing the name of the show, which is rapport to rap porn.

[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.660]
Oh, rap porn, I see.

[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:49.160]
I see.

[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:50.100]
Oh, hi.

[00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:51.980]
Uh, rapport to rap porn.

[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:52.600]
I was wondering.

[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:58.680]
Mangus Ackerman, who oversees the hourly news updates told tabloid expression he was shocked and dismayed the mistake.

[00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:01.080]
It's a huge blunder by us, he said.

[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:02.880]
A huge blunder bus.

[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:04.220]
Ever see a huge blunder bus?

[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:09.160]
Yes, as a matter of fact, news media didn't know jitties are a blunder bus driven by those Haitian guys.

[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.160]
19 before 11 at 560, nobody come to that.

[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.280]
I give our poll yet for today.

[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:13.860]
I did not.

[00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:17.840]
That's all already 20 less than 20 before 11.

[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:19.180]
I still haven't given today's poll yet.

[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:20.520]
And we got 868.

[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:23.340]
Who should the Democrats run for president in 2008?

[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.700]
And you may think it's a little premature evaluation.

[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:30.440]
You better start thinking about it right now, mister, because this regime has got to go.

[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:31.500]
Got to go.

[00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:33.560]
Al Gore 248.

[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.460]
Not great, but 248.

[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:36.560]
He'd be okay.

[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:37.780]
He already won once.

[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:38.720]
Why don't you give another shot?

[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.080]
Howardine 144.

[00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:42.140]
Good choice, but no chance.

[00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:43.800]
I don't care 111.

[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:45.440]
Well, isn't that PTK now?

[00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:47.540]
111 people don't give a crap.

[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.300]
Barack Obama 87.

[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:50.160]
No chance.

[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:50.960]
Too dark.

[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:52.200]
Hillary 77.

[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:53.360]
Oh my god.

[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:54.700]
John Edward 64.

[00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:55.940]
Too redneckie.

[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:57.640]
Joe Biden 56.

[00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.100]
Too a full of crap.

[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:00.320]
Too wishy washy.

[00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:01.160]
He's another watchler.

[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.040]
Elliott's fit.

[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:03.240]
You know how many votes?

[00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:03.760]
How many it's got?

[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:04.820]
About 30, man.

[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:05.480]
But he's Jewish.

[00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:08.400]
I hate this poll 29 only 3.3%.

[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:09.760]
John Kerry 17.

[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:10.040]
17.

[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.820]
1.9% for scary John Kerry.

[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:13.480]
Wow.

[00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:17.280]
And Russ Beingold, who just went on there, he's going to pass Kerry like he's sitting down.

[00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:18.980]
He's got six, but he'll go by him.

[00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:19.540]
Oh, he's Jewish.

[00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:21.620]
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:23.900]
Oh, I just think you think a Jew can get elected president?

[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:26.880]
What you laughing about?

[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:27.700]
Well, it depends.

[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:28.820]
Look at that Jew leader.

[00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:30.180]
I don't know how a Jew leader can be either.

[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:30.200]

[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.120]
Because this was for Democrats.

[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:31.760]
No, to Jew.

[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:33.760]
1042 at 560 WDQM.

[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:36.600]
If he's going back to school, it can be a little rough for the kids.

[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:41.040]
A good night's sleep is critical for development of a healthy mind or even an unhealthy mind.

[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:44.840]
If your kids are having trouble adjusting to school night, then it may just be the mattress

[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:46.160]
that's sleeping on as a piece of crap.

[00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:47.960]
It may be lumpy, bumpy and had it.

[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:48.360]
Done.

[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:49.600]
Fneeto, like a lot of us.

[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.460]
Called Adamatris, toll free at 1-800-Matras.

[00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:54.760]
They can recommend the mattress for kids of any age.

[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:58.360]
Have a new bed delivered date and time you choose the same deal they've been doing for years.

[00:33:58.520 --> 00:33:59.980]
And nobody can come close to matching it.

[00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:03.860]
Seven days a week from 8-10-10pm, you give Adamatris a tour of a window.

[00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:05.580]
And they go over your mattress on time.

[00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:07.200]

[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:31.300]
1-800-MATTR ESLI Roth to last, as because it stands for Stoopend is Sensational Saving.

[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:33.900]
This is Neil Rogers.

[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:38.260]
This is 5.62-A-S.

[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.980]
David's a bitch.

[00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:45.860]
That's a good word.

[00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:49.060]
Seize.

[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:52.340]
Get gays.

[00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:56.340]
Get gays.

[00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:57.560]
Get on mine.

[00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:01.660]
I don't tell the world to dig.

[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.380]
I'm a certain kind of a way.

[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:07.820]
Yes, I do very very much.

[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.740]
You didn't know.

[00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:12.820]
I used to make your scream.

[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:15.580]
But about the worst I'd dream.

[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:21.180]
Like just in Timberlake, I think he's so high.

[00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:24.280]
So do I want to live a great day?

[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.180]
I want to stay.

[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:30.200]
Don't even pretend that I'm back.

[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.340]
I am gay, gay, gay, gay.

[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:34.280]
Would have run to go to space.

[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:37.020]
Sweaty ass and not so low of a space.

[00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:41.480]
They would have loved my dying days.

[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.660]
I'm gay, gay, gay, gay, gay.

[00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:45.160]
10.47, gay.

[00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:48.300]
At 5.60 WDQM, happy Tuesday to August 22.

[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:50.560]
Oh, and by the way, today August 22.

[00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:52.160]
Oh, where did I do that?

[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.840]
Don't tell me I didn't print that out.

[00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:56.120]
Did I end the world today in history or something?

[00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:56.720]
No, no.

[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.320]
It's more important than that.

[00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:00.760]
Oh, don't tell me.

[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:01.760]
I don't have that in my power.

[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:06.160]
Today is supposed to be the big with the Muslims.

[00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:08.180]
I think what?

[00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:09.000]
Oh, huh?

[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:09.980]
A big to-do?

[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:10.880]
Yeah.

[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:13.840]
And I don't think I got it in my pile here.

[00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:15.460]
Oh, no, that's bad.

[00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:16.520]
It was all about...

[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:19.580]
There's some bubble-mice here they got about August 22.

[00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:21.240]
It is the day of something.

[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:22.920]
And I don't have it.

[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:24.180]
I was sure I had it.

[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:25.060]
I think you stole it.

[00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:25.780]
Yes, I did.

[00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:26.720]
Yes, I don't think you took it.

[00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:28.940]
Well, I got too many of these stupid memos here.

[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.700]
And I got too much stuff here about John Van A.

[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.620]
But first, I got the memo about Kenny Walker during WDQM.

[00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:36.700]
Everybody knows that by now.

[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:38.160]
And, you know, who Kenny Walker is?

[00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:38.920]
Oh, never heard of him.

[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:42.060]
So I should probably read this the way it's written.

[00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:43.740]
It's just funny to show.

[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:48.860]
Program director Josh Darrow of South Florida's Heritage Sports Radio Station.

[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:50.540]
I have no idea what that means.

[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:51.660]
And he couldn't explain it either.

[00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:53.500]
560 WDQM.

[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:55.700]
I guess that's supposed to be like a little shot.

[00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:58.960]
Well, we were here first, okay, before all these other imitators came along.

[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.720]
Really, Heritage Sports Radio Station.

[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:01.280]
It means old.

[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:07.140]
Has announced a legendary Florida radio personality Kenny Walker is joining the station in effect of August 20th.

[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:09.480]
That's just next Monday, damn it.

[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:11.220]
Walker best known for as many years as well.

[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:15.120]
100s morning show host with sidekick footie who's a real a-hole.

[00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:16.820]
Well, host a morning drive slot.

[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.320]
And I mean, it's not me saying that.

[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:19.240]
That's what clearance wrote in there.

[00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:20.040]
Footies real a-hole.

[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:23.380]
Well, Crow host a morning drive slot Monday through Friday from 7 to 10 a.m.

[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:27.700]
Along with Kim Bo-Bo-Kamper for the brand new Kenny and Bo-Mo-Rin show.

[00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:30.700]
So we got no Mo Mo and we got no Mo Crow.

[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:32.000]
But we got Kenny and Bo.

[00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:32.900]
How do you like that?

[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:33.400]
Yo, yo, yo.

[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:33.720]
But no.

[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:37.260]
We are very pleased to welcome Kenny as the newest member of the QM staff said,

[00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:41.420]
Dero is very background connection to the dolphins in impressive history in South Florida.

[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:44.820]
Makes for a great addition to our already stellar lineup of air talent.

[00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:49.980]
Walker, the tremendously popular radio personality who Neal had never heard of until this memo,

[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.220]
had been with Y100 for 10 years.

[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:55.220]
Most recently is half of the Kenny and footie team on the Y100 morning show.

[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:58.120]
Well, unfortunately when I'm in town, I don't listen to Y100, do you?

[00:37:58.300 --> 00:37:58.460]
Why?

[00:37:58.940 --> 00:37:59.280]
100.

[00:37:59.700 --> 00:37:59.920]
Huh?

[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:01.120]
No, I have never.

[00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:02.100]
Why?

[00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:03.260]
100.

[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.700]
Not for a long time, I should say.

[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:05.580]
Well, the real child.

[00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:07.400]
This canter was on 100 years ago.

[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:07.860]
That's right.

[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:09.360]
And wasn't so funny.

[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:10.480]
Funny socks was on it.

[00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:11.120]
I had a little while then.

[00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:11.920]
She was on she.

[00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:15.400]
Did he get canned at the kiss or dream mat?

[00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:16.380]
25.

[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:19.980]
I probably shouldn't have said that either because then the joy is falling.

[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:20.240]

[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:24.000]
Walker, the tremendously popular radio personality who had been with the Y100 for 10 years.

[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:24.720]
Yada yada.

[00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:29.900]
When Kenny became available, we saw a huge opportunity to grab one of the best low-cost

[00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:32.340]
DJs in South Florida and put them on WQAM.

[00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:41.040]
The combination of Kenny and Kim Boatcamp for the Kenny and Boat morning show is something we are very confident and excited about.

[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:44.180]
I know thousands of fans have been missing Kenny's presence on the air.

[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:48.100]
We are thrilled to have him as part of the team, Joe Bell, WQM General Manager.

[00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:53.100]
Now, do you think that those 10-year-old kids that listen to Y100, those people are going to be listening to WQAM?

[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.280]
We hope so.

[00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:54.940]
They will be now.

[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:57.980]
Because anybody over 15 don't have any idea who Kenny Walker was.

[00:38:58.100 --> 00:38:59.060]
But I'm sure he's going to be great.

[00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:02.780]
Walker, the voice of the dolphins is their in-state MPA announcer.

[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:05.400]
After Joe, we were, Jaybro Keach got canned because he was two.

[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:08.160]
Now, wait, when Jaybro Keach was he doing the dolphins who just the Marlins?

[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:09.040]
Josh.

[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:10.920]
I'm not sure if he was doing the dolphins.

[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:13.100]
But you did get candor by the Marlins.

[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:14.560]
I don't know about that.

[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:16.000]
Yeah, Jaybro Keach.

[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:19.100]
You know, he thought he was too soft a morocan or like what he does at UM stuff.

[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:22.740]
You know, hurricane, home run by another cell, you know, like that.

[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:24.540]
He's a silly guy.

[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.460]
But his family made a lot of money in pickles.

[00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:27.780]
And they're in a pickle business.

[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:29.060]
Don't tell Joyce that.

[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:31.960]
Walker, voice of the dolphins, has in their state and MPA announcer.

[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:36.400]
He was the proud father of three and married and Dory Grogan, director of the dolphins cheerleaders

[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.300]
and event entertainment.

[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:40.480]
Oh my god, it sounds like a really incestuous setup to me.

[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:41.680]
Oh, the good guy.

[00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:43.300]
I didn't say that.

[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:44.460]
I just said an incestuous relationship.

[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:46.260]
She's the dolphin.

[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:47.860]
I wonder if they know Fudge Brown.

[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:48.660]
Probably.

[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:49.860]
Heck of a job, Brownie.

[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:55.500]
Other changes in the sports radio, QM lineup, will take place August 28, 2006 and will include.

[00:39:55.900 --> 00:40:00.240]
The big O or Land of Ozagiri who started all those rumors about across the street, by the way.

[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:00.980]
Rock solid.

[00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:02.600]
Monday through Friday, 5 to 7 a.m.

[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:03.420]
Isn't that true, Josh?

[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:04.100]
Don't say anything.

[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:06.200]
He just did nervous life.

[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:07.020]
You know it's true.

[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:09.680]
You wouldn't know what Tommy, but somebody told me that it was George Senate.

[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:12.820]
It's amazing the way those Cubans turn on each other like a bird, rent.

[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:19.160]
The Kenney and Bo morning show with Kenny Walker and Kim Bo Bo camper, coma inducing Kimba.

[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:20.960]
Monday through Friday, 7 to 10 a.m.

[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:22.320]
Neo Roger, 10 to 2.

[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:24.640]
Just like, you know, you don't even get mentioned here.

[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:27.380]
Mad Dog, Jim Maddage, 2 to 4 p.m.

[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:30.540]
Mad Dog, Jim Maddage and the Hammer, Hank Goldberg, 4 to 5 p.m. together.

[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:33.400]
The most expensive hour in South Florida, radio, 4 to 5.

[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:36.280]
The Hammer, Hank Goldberg, a solo, 5 to 7 p.m.

[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:39.300]
So in other words, Mad Dog's doing 2 to 5, Hank's doing 4 to 7.

[00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:40.500]
They had an hour of cross-dress.

[00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:43.980]
Game broadcaster and sports talk Monday through Friday, 7 to 10 p.m.

[00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:45.220]
and it kept on 10 to 2.

[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:46.560]
I said, where's Geltie in this?

[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:49.580]
And for I said, you've got to think I'm going to put a guy who sounds like that on the air.

[00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:50.200]
I said, good point.

[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:52.240]
And then there's the thing on the bottom of this.

[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.400]
This is hysterical.

[00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:54.400]
This press release.

[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:57.820]
I bet you didn't put a press release out about our spring rating book, Diddy.

[00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:58.740]
Current zero.

[00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:02.560]
Because this was the one that kicked ass while the others were sucking a hind wind.

[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:06.220]
But he didn't put a memo out about that or a press release because we might have gotten

[00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:08.600]
some mentioned somewhere, like by Barry Jackass.

[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:12.000]
Then here's the thing about the Beasley group, which the less said about them, the better.

[00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:13.840]
Founded in 1961.

[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:20.400]
Oens or operates 42 stations, 26th FM and 16 AM, in 10 large and mid-sized markets in the US.

[00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:21.020]
Oh, yeah.

[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:27.880]
In addition to sports radio 560, in the mining market, Beasley owns 99.9 Kiscountry, WKIS,

[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:33.380]
Power 96, Money Talk Radio, WSBRAM740, which there are six people listen to that.

[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:38.220]
Health Talk Radio, WNN, 1470, which I think that's the station and Mr. Ego's on.

[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:38.620]
I'm not sure.

[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:42.100]
And WHSRAM980, and nobody knows what that is.

[00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:42.760]
Do you know what it is?

[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:43.820]
I asked the parents here in the YD.

[00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:43.940]

[00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:46.900]
And now, here comes the best part.

[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:55.840]
Beasley's WQAM, WKIS, Power 96, WWNN, and WHSRAM are now broadcasting in crystal clear,

[00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:02.660]
CD quality sound made possible by HD radio technology for those six people who have access to HD radios.

[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:04.240]
Don't you love our crystal clear signal?

[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:06.700]
Like that.

[00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:08.060]
Oh, God, I love it.

[00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:09.680]
This is a quick look at that radio.

[00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:10.460]
Huh?

[00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:11.880]
Just wait till people get that radio.

[00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:12.560]
Oh, yeah.

[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:15.960]
Wait, well, here's an article by Bob Geiger.

[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:17.680]
A lot of words, but who's counting?

[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:18.720]
That's cute.

[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:19.920]
Oh, no, this is good.

[00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:20.540]
This is perfect.

[00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:21.120]
I love this.

[00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:22.980]
All John Van A all the time.

[00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:25.520]
I can't believe I don't have that article about August 22nd.

[00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:26.700]
Is this the end of the world today?

[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:31.240]
There's something Hocus Pocus, MUMBO JUMBO JUMBO JET.

[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:31.820]
I don't know what it is.

[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:32.660]
I can't find it.

[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.200]
Did I put it on our website?

[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:34.740]
Josh?

[00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:37.440]
I don't know.

[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:37.740]
I wouldn't know.

[00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:38.480]
I sent you so many data.

[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:39.860]
I breathed through those things, man.

[00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:40.900]
And there's like, Haiti, I don't know.

[00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:46.400]
I don't know.

[00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:48.100]
I don't know.

[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:55.820]
I don't know.

[00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:58.500]
I don't know.

[00:42:58.620 --> 00:42:59.320]
I don't know.

[00:42:59.320 --> 00:42:59.900]
I don't know.

[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:01.980]
I don't know.

[00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:03.020]
I don't know.

[00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:03.240]
I don't know.

[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:03.660]
I don't know.

[00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:03.960]
I don't know.

[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:04.180]
I don't know.

[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:04.640]
I don't know.

[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:05.800]
I don't know.

[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:06.220]
I don't know.

[00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:06.820]
I don't know.

[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:06.920]

[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:06.920]

[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:07.240]
I don't know.

[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:07.960]
I don't know.

[00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:08.820]
I don't know.

[00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:10.080]
I don't know.

[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:10.640]
I don't know.

[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:10.720]
I don't know.

[00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:10.780]
I don't know.

[00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:10.780]

[00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:10.780]

[00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:10.780]

[00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:10.860]
I don't know.

[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:13.100]
And anyway, you can't find it.

[00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:14.740]
Very important, though, today's the end of the world.

[00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:19.320]
Bob Gaigher writes in what is this, so where he writes?

[00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:24.780]
Bob Gaigher in all the global male, Toronto Global Male.

[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:27.240]
All John Vanet all the time.

[00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:31.900]
And when he was this morning, this was yesterday, we have yet another blood bath in Iraq, as government

[00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:36.860]
shoot up a she-eyed religious procession in Baghdad, killing at least 16 people, injuring 230 men.

[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:40.840]
Central United Nations, Indian and African, African and African.

[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:43.940]
insurgents guess we didn't really get rid of the Taliban before George W.

[00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:46.840]
Zirak disaster was started and there's renewed trouble in the tenuous

[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:50.420]
Middle East ceasefire and what's the top story on all the cable news channels

[00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:54.280]
this Sunday morning the John Boney Ramsey case and the gripping fact that the

[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:58.200]
newly discovered suspect John Mark Carr is on a plane and coming back to the USA

[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:03.040]
Are you kidding me really are you freaking kidding me he says

[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:07.420]
don't get me wrong I'm the father of a nine-year-old boy and I can appreciate the horror of any child being murdered

[00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:11.540]
but this case is one child it's over a decade old and at this point there are serious

[00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:14.800]
questions over whether Carvala are even turned out to be a viable suspect in the killings

[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:17.060]
SPTC baby PTA

[00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:18.280]
Elemental P

[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.680]
Lucky Strike means fine tobacco LSMFT

[00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:25.280]
this may be an important regional stirring Colorado where the killing occurred and perhaps

[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:28.840]
the seventh-rate story told to a national audience but considering everything else

[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:32.420]
of really important that truly affects the stability of our planet and real people's lives

[00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:35.720]
this is nowhere near the top story on our national news

[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:39.160]
adding to what will continue to be an ongoing media session with this case in which our

[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:42.660]
single threaded corporate media finds this to be the only story they can cover

[00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:46.840]
is the fact that it's now been revealed that Carvala's a patient at a bank talk clinic that

[00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:50.840]
specializes in sex change operations and it looks like Carvala went there for treatments

[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:54.100]
oh boy the only way this gets knocked out of the news now is some

[00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:58.540]
when some blonde ship goes missing in the Caribbean so here's a chicken and a question

[00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:02.520]
have the American people become so dumbed down because this is the kind of non-story that the

[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:06.240]
corporate media beats into the ground for hours on end and for days at a time or does the media

[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:10.240]
do it because we've become so vacant and disinterested in real news that this is the kind of stuff we

[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:14.060]
all really care about I would say both of the above there's a lot of speculation going on about

[00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:17.920]
whether car story even makes sense and a friend of mine who's both a lawyer and writer said he

[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:21.920]
wouldn't report more than a one-liner about this until DNA evidence or other innocent will prove

[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:26.640]
verifies the car car's as old girls death for the sake of our national awareness and intellect I

[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:30.980]
hope DNA testing is done quickly and whoever should be carrying so intensely gets to the bottom

[00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:35.260]
of this case even if car does turn out to be the killer this is not the top story in the world

[00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:39.140]
right now it's not even close and what if it's discovered that he's just an intention seeking

[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:43.260]
none case that had nothing to do with it at this point the media's push this is the start we

[00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:47.080]
should all care about the exclusion of all others they made the decision that a suspect an

[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:50.500]
10 year old murder case and the fact that he's getting on an airplane is more important than the

[00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:54.360]
incendiary situation in the Middle East a civil war in Iraq has killing an average of 100 people

[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:58.120]
a day in the way our own involvement in that Craig Murray drags our country further into the

[00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:02.460]
toilet every day and even if they did focus on these real stories they should still find time to

[00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:06.300]
talk about 46 million Americans with no health insurance and looming all questions that will

[00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:10.460]
have severe impact on people's winter approaches that's what journalists are supposed to do for a living

[00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:15.520]
but in defiance of all of that now we're assaulted with all John but a all the time in their

[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:18.960]
warp news judgment the media is deciding for all of us what we should be more concerned about

[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:22.760]
men by men developments with John Mark Carr then the fact that our brave men and women continue

[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:26.680]
to be lost in the recognize canister they're making a decision every hour the mystery of such

[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:30.800]
incredibly species importance is more relevant than the death of our men and women serving in

[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:35.620]
uniform overseas and for that factor alone they should be profoundly ashamed of the disease.

[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:32.860]
the

[00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:55.100]
about three don't you believe the word of that man he didn't do it and the dog done it and of

historian provides the details in Islam as in Judaism and Christianity professor wrote there are

[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:26.540]

[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:36.340]
victory of the forces of good over evil however those may be defined the hidden imam I wonder if

[00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:42.320]

the trouser kissinger when you hear trying to respawn of these things that you I don't know

[00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:20.720]
whether you're going to pee in your pants you just on the floor you would only anti-Semitic propaganda

[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:25.260]
mr. Ahmadina jordan as far as clearly believe that this is the time the time is now not to mention

[00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:29.960]
of course camboady in the command of ruch nice job there too guys see we invented all of these

[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:35.380]
just like we invented the al-Qaeda and the Israeli's admitted his blah and Hamas but nonetheless

[00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:39.320]
mr. Ahmadina juts yeah keep going back to the beginning so I can say it again and as far as

[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:43.020]
clearly believe that the time is now and that the terminal struggle has already begun and is

[00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:47.200]
indeed well advanced although it just saw there on CNN the certainly Nazi news network including

[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:53.280]
wolf list greek that who's a former APAC guy I just saw that a bird by the that arancis they wanted

[00:49:53.280 --> 00:50:00.900]
to get into serious talks on nuclear stuff they said it's a bomb it's a gas and they even have a

[00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:04.640]
data says indicated by several references by the Iranian president to giving his final answer to the

[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:10.300]
about nuclear development by august 22nd Lewis continues what is the significance of august 22nd

[00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:15.020]
that's today by the way this year august 22nd correspondence the islam accounted to the

[00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:20.300]
27th day of the month of raw job in the year 1427 this by tradition is the night when many muslims

[00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:25.560]
commemorate the night flight of the prophet Muhammad on the winged horrors brack first of the farthest

[00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:30.980]
mosque usually identified with jrusselam and then to heaven and then back this might well be deemed

[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:35.000]
an appropriate date for the apocalyptic ending of israel and if necessary the world it says

[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:39.620]
and they just said that they want to sit down has some serious talks on nukes please don't bomb us

[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:44.500]
this sort of quiz i religious scaremon we always find to receptive audience in the US especially

[00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:49.860]
among Christians of jihadist persuasion rights Brian would occur in the guardian at 90 years old

[00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:53.680]
professor Lewis may have completely lost his marbles but he is still faded by the white house

[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:57.400]
vice president dick cheney was guest of honor with his birthday party in april and the wall

[00:50:57.400 --> 00:51:01.880]
for the journal describes him as a sage he is printed with coined the phrase class civilizations

[00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:08.380]
in 1990 and that seems intent on making it a reality never to less professor of the was does manage

[00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:12.680]
if he's to spot a few drawbacks in his alleged erinian attempt to obliterate israel and attack

[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:17.140]
that wife's that israel would almost certainly wipe out the palestinians to he writes this white

[00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:21.060]
while be of concern to the palestinians but not apparently to their fanatical champions in the

[00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:25.840]
erinian government he then suddenly demolishes his own argument with this caveat it is far from

[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:30.280]
certain that mr. afflund indian plans any such cataclysmic event precisely for august 22

[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:34.520]
so why exactly did the arrangements use august 22 is the day for giving the rancid the west about

[00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:39.380]
nuclear development which they said let's talk probably for bureaucratic convenience when they

[00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:42.960]
promised to reply by the end of august they didn't actually use the word august but the erinian

[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:47.560]
equivalent if you look at the Persian calendar or your Persian carpet you'll see that august 22

[00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:53.280]
just happened to be the end of the month known as more dad see how we got to that more dad got it

[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:58.820]
less mom more dad i don't suppose this will discourage the neocons from continuing to write such a loopy

[00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:02.840]
prophetic nonsense here's another than michael leedon formally a key figure in the rank contrast

[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:07.720]
scandal and the rack measure yellow take affair in these years excuse me predicting an erinian nuclear

[00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:11.420]
test by november five that's my birthday they're going to do an honor of me an honor of

[00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:16.480]
deal good the erinians believe they now have all the necessary components for nuclear bomb the

[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:20.120]
only question is how long will take them to assemble and test it come any it hope to be able to

[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:24.180]
test an atomic bomb by the third week in october but aside to be advised as recently told them

[00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:27.760]
that they could not make that deadline now they're aiming for november fourth or fifth the

[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:31.520]
anniversary of the seizure of the american embassy in teoran during the revolution there is

[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:35.100]
another remembered that our leadership takes seriously the twenty fifty anniversary of the

[00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:39.260]
disappearance of the twelve imam and that's the most significant date in the she-ite calendar

[00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:43.460]
reports from teoran suggests that the mullahs would like to celebrate that anniversary with a big

[00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:49.120]
time terror taking in america and then it says he writes brolytic russes uttertosh what a silly

[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:52.740]
brit uttertosh don't believe a word of it leading was not talking about this coming november

[00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:56.260]

food has never been hotter so ordered grills gone wild today you may just kiss the cook

[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:27.460]
I prefer a nice broth myself it's 1119 to 560 WN we got 973 votes on a pool we're gonna have

[01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:33.080]
a thousand by 1130 how do you like that or close to it aren't you impressed we're not I'm impressed

[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:37.860]
and I'll tell you why I was inspired to do this poll okay because of a story from raw story

[01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:42.300]
while I love that website not as much as I love watching these two DVDs over the weekend the

[01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:45.360]
trials of Henry Kissinger and the hunting of the president the 10-year campaign to destroy

[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:49.160]
Bill Clinton you'll see what a slime ball can he start really is on air in case you didn't already

[01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:53.940]
know it and you know remember he was gonna resign his special account prosecutor name was

[01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:57.980]
gonna go with the property of peppered i do remember guess who's the main funder the main

[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:04.480]
hot shot donor to peppered i university i did a melonscape oh yeah and then finally after the

[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:08.560]
whole thing was over and they blew it and they didn't they're convicted yes where he wound up

[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:14.140]
can he star peppered i he's the same Richard melonscape it's puts all the words and missed

[01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:18.820]
rudges mouth i'm not sure what else but a new poll published this week in time magazine finds

[01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:22.560]
former vice president al Gore i'm gonna tell you something he's making a comeback even though

[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:27.900]
some of you may be laughing right now although he's doing well in our poll some of you may be

[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:33.920]
laughing a little bit what how is that thing where he just goes nuts huh i don't know it's in here

[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:43.020]
so here it is how dare they drag the good thing of the united states of america through the mud

[01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:49.880]
of sedom who say torture president Abu ghar red i mean who you know look what pop had we got

[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:56.640]
uh... what we got now pop had gore and we got bush anyway the poll in time magazines is al Gore

[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:02.200]
who insist he isn't running trail senator swore a clinton by only five points the poll finds

[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:06.180]
gore and hellry splitting a large majority of democratic support forty six to forty one percent

[01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:12.080]
it further finds the senator from new york to be a wildly polarizing figure i can't stand her man

[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:16.720]
for like two seconds me either she's a spony as a seventy six and a half dollar bill yet she is

[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:20.340]
hellry clinton may be the most polarizing figure on the current political landscape

[01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:25.200]
time has to be spotted about eleven phrases one could use to describe her from likeable to would

[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:29.920]
protect america against terrorism democrats and republicans disagreed by margin of over forty points

[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:33.800]
on the applicability of a to them and by fifty points on three of them including strong leader

[01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:38.560]
uh... democrats at seventy seven percent republicans twenty five would protect america against terrorism

[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:43.660]
democrats sixty seven republicans seventeen has strong world values democrats sixty nine republicans

[01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:48.040]
sixteen audiotic democrats and republicans came closest in agreement on her intelligence

[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:52.560]
democrats ninety one percent seventy three percent and likely that she's sent up her important

[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:57.020]
issues to women perhaps a sign that whatever her other problems the candidate she's not being held

[01:02:57.020 --> 01:02:59.880]
back by gender stereotypes well she's a dick what do you expect

[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:03.620]
in fact maybe you never see her in john marcae together

[01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:08.300]
car or a could mean that republicans hit her so much they don't care if she smart

[01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:11.600]
partisan divisions even color views of her partisanship

[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:16.100]
Hillary proponents have a small read of hope to grasp in the sixty percent independence

[01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:19.640]
that agree with democrats that politically she's somewhere in between liberal and conservative

[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:23.740]
perhaps the most intriguing partisan divide comes when bill clinton enters the picture

[01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:27.300]
where fifty seven percent democrats agreed that Hillary should have stayed with bill despite

[01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:32.080]
his affair with monica only thirty two percent of republicans back as a defensive marriage act

[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:35.880]
agree i wonder what you liberty saying now about that

[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:40.140]
all of a sudden you know how july brimman is talking about how donny rumsfeld ought to step down

[01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:43.740]
and all these terrible things in the way the war has been conducted so badly and all this blood

[01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:49.960]
shit in the city knows that how he's changing his tomb real bad oh yeah oh boy too late yeah anyway

[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:54.960]
George took this pool on friday over the weekend now did you get a lot of calls on us about this

[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:59.340]
to john marcarc as that's all we're talking about uh no well there's a sama on seeing them with the

[01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:10.120]
christian and purist same person within the news media there was quite a lot of common there's that

[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:14.280]
under nineteen overwhelming forty two point what you better know and you better care okay like

[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:19.320]
that article that i read the little water goes said all john bane all the time right right

[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:24.500]
some of the fund you two ninety seven don't know two forty six the dead one sixty three in the

[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:29.760]
mom one sixty two even steven for she's off though now and john car the weird guy that confessed

[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:34.780]
only hundred seventeen now what do you tell me about sptc it's from the bible a a modified version

[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:39.140]
depending on which translation judges chapter eight five line like that well and the old

[01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:44.400]
testament your body this bible your baby bible baby well did you bible you know what you know it

[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:49.060]
and if you try to get the exact passage over here but it doesn't uh add up exactly there's more

[01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:53.780]
to that line to in his yearbook well what is that's an excerpt so what difference does it make

[01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:59.460]
none i guess i shall be the conqueror and that's what it said at the end of the ransom note that

[01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:04.180]
we sptc the line in the yearbook said maybe i shall be the conqueror and live in multiple peace

[01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:08.300]
and if you notice the years the scribbling on there looks just like the scribbling on a ransom note

[01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:13.980]
it does look similar yeah looks i hope a lot more similar than uh then the stuff from uh what's

[01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:18.860]
your name the dead one patsy she's just a patsy i told you so do you have a lot of calls about

[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:30.100]
there you go s b t c now i still don't understand what you were saying it's from the bible well

[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:35.000]
supposedly according to susan kandiyati and the cnn transcript well there's somebody we actually

[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:39.740]
likes the on cnn susan kandiyati she's the only one i think in judges chapter eight the bible says

[01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:44.000]
i shall return a conqueror and peace bob bobblaw but i'll be dem to fight and find it oh look what's

[01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:55.040]
happening eleven thirty it could mean don cars heading to hold or do or this could stretch out for weeks

[01:11:55.940 --> 01:12:01.960]
probably mean he's going to leave very shortly there's really only a very narrow issue at stake in

[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:06.760]
the next time by the way just why discovered was a very good guy Jeffrey tuban cnn there's another

[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:11.640]
guy we like that's his voice there he's right there he's a good guy okay i'll write it down he's

[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:16.820]
not one of those right wing opal just uh in the in the uh on the payroll of kind of guys five six

[01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:21.060]
seven oh five sixty maybe the audience knows what s b t c stands for huh we could take a poll

[01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:27.280]
no not a poll i don't know how about some suggestions not a poll victory s b t c and then he has

[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:31.540]
that in his uh your book written uh years earlier um how how much early with that have been he's

[01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:37.800]
41 now is that all he is is if anybody yes he's 41 she is yes it is so i mean like 23 years ago he

[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:42.900]
wrote s b t c i shall be the conqueror and then he writes uh they are ransom though now you're

[01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:46.480]
suggesting that maybe he's in cooots with somebody maybe they're going to split up that then he

[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:50.760]
also evidently you knew something about there was some kind of a check stub on the desk in the house

[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:37.060]
himself George went and saw a shakes on a plane and he said it sucked yes but don't tell anybody

[01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:40.380]
that because you're supposed to believe that it's the best thing no actually they didn't do all

[01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:43.740]
like that of the boxwar first this weekend they got all that hype in fact i'm not how much

[01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:47.840]
hype a movie can get i went and bought a bunch of these DVDs over the weekend that i toyed

[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:51.340]

[01:20:55.160 --> 01:21:02.040]

[01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:06.040]

[01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:22.180]
as far as money goes not not what they were expecting i don't think i couldn't be wrong about that

[01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:26.740]
because that's not my herb expertise but i think you're wrong let's double check it i'm checking it

[01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:42.880]
james fundamentalist bible and so the character of the catholic or latin bible judges judge not

[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:50.180]
less db a lady john marcar he's a lady with a pear shaped ass what's wrong with you guys not a

[01:21:50.180 --> 01:21:54.420]
surprise that he would be a can i tell you i'm the last third there i can i see a lady i know one

[01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:59.860]
that's a lady anyway a chapter eight verse nine it says he said therefore to them also

[01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:06.000]
when i shall return a conqueror in peace that's not it what's not an exact match but

[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:13.060]
no get out of here that's not the idea i will destroy this tower dixit it's okay uh

[01:22:13.060 --> 01:22:19.140]
reverses share oh your ass but what's that latin yeah latin you're ever what is this so i

[01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:35.000]
no it's modified i shall be the conqueror well and i'm glad you might have been brought that

[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.020]
up though because another thing that they're telling us about him along with every other detail

[01:22:38.020 --> 01:22:41.840]
like what he had for breakfast this morning which i'm sure wasn't as good as dino on a plane

[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:45.860]
but nevertheless what we found out about him is that he was brave raising a good religious

[01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:52.260]
background good religious family man what brand what brand what we these what brand of christ john

[01:22:52.260 --> 01:22:56.640]
oh well he became a catholic of course there you go that's why he got a lot in bible going well

[01:22:56.640 --> 01:23:01.980]
pedophile and catholic in that like a double talk that's at the club for it and then he was a

[01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:05.900]
teacher and they don't know what was that school in uh latin america somewhere sent to america

[01:23:05.900 --> 01:23:10.800]
moana or Honduras somewhere he's teaching very briefly maybe nika no it was not nika raga

[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:15.380]
by the way nice job on butchering all those people in latin america Henry Kissinger and in

[01:23:15.380 --> 01:23:19.220]
uh canvoli and in east chemo and all around the world no wonder the french one are frying

[01:23:19.220 --> 01:23:22.760]

[01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:27.360]

[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:33.520]
vomit well i think uh when he said try to butcher up now in the war you know i think that down

[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:39.420]
rama's fall about to put his resignation such a whiny wimpy piece of crap man so far bison i tell

[01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:43.060]
him what do i tell you about when you and you had your own experience thanks to your accountant

[01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:47.380]
there your orthodox accountant when you when you're wrapped in to fill in two tight

[01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:52.500]
it's bad for the circulation that's what happens in your brain shrivels how does god get a note you

[01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:57.160]
love him and i'm sure that's something that shrivels up opposition among american and then

[01:23:57.160 --> 01:24:01.500]
nobody coming through anything on this sb tc because and you want to know why they don't know what

[01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:08.600]
that it means small balls take charge that's clearance i'm telling you man he's the one that killed

[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:21.220]
nothing what kind of ranking though it was number one but it would but that's nothing they

[01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:25.320]
nothing going on right now either yeah it had very little competition it's not that big man

[01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:30.920]
not that big and the movie either put the bombs snake on a plane oh come on and isn't it interesting

[01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:36.620]
how snakes on a plane was released just coincidentally on friday just timing with this whole thing

[01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:41.000]
this terror alert we had an anger i'm not suggesting there's any connection mind you you know it reminds

[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:46.460]
me of it's like wagging the dog remember when that movie came out tried the dog yep and remember how

[01:24:46.460 --> 01:24:52.320]
coincident all the timing was on that deal i got news for when you watch this clinton clip in fact

[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:56.440]
even if you don't watch the rest of the movie which i know you will but anybody else just watch

[01:24:56.440 --> 01:25:00.320]
the part where clinton comes out after the initial screening of the movie and he talks to the

[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:05.140]
audience it's just fabulous stuff it's really good and you'll say top hat tent and look what we

yes it's important and we stay there and get it done or we leave bush argued we're not leaving

[01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:28.860]
so long as i'm present that'll be a huge mistake so much for all that troop withdrawal crap huh yeah

[01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:34.000]
you announced that the nation would be offering 230 million dollars in aid to Lebanon yeah and we

[01:28:31.340 --> 01:28:35.840]
you watch why we fight you like a lot more man he will he said that he'd tell that like it is

[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:39.720]
and especially considering the fact that he spent so much of his life in the military to be the one

[01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:43.920]
that out of the military industrial congressional complex that's the important part the third

[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:47.540]
part of congressional complex and he left he left out in the speech the working

[01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:50.640]
congressional because he didn't want to offend his friends in congress but that's what he was

[01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:50.640]
pair man is really good in spite of her husband who was a little bit crazy person that literally

[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:56.000]

[01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:04.460]
right ahead and she just let them run her ass through the ringer instead one of the few people in

[01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:10.000]
the history I can think of a way she stood up for anything other than the prayers of the assembly

[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.620]
in school and the national anthem at the ballgame and of course the invocation to football game

[01:32:14.620 --> 01:32:21.160]
in Jesus name Amen are they still doing that crap I don't know it goes past me I've never heard it

[01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:24.700]
but well the dolphins are one of the few didn't we go through this last year yes we did yes we did

don't have the invocation anymore and leave it to the hopper had to call in straighted on said that

[01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:38.220]
they're one of a couple of teams that still do that crap and make the people stand up for some kind

[01:32:38.220 --> 01:32:42.900]
of stupid ass prayer before the ballgame first it often they could use it you know what I mean

[01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:47.880]
but anyway Susan McDougal is great and this boy this film is great the honey of the president

[01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:52.580]
the 10 year campaign to destroy Bill Clinton almost as good though as the trouser Henry Kissinger

[01:35:02.580 --> 01:35:08.760]
I know I've got a fingered out Mary Marty Lustre this isn't even lack Lustre he

[01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:12.940]
represented 125th district which includes Ethic and New York as a Democrat and they are

[01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:17.500]
state assembly from maybe eight to two thousand two a New York assemblyman he writes in the

[01:35:17.500 --> 01:35:22.720]
Ethica Journal of All Places uncovering the Clinton disappointment it's about swillery Marty Lustre

[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:27.860]
as in Hillary is a little lack Lustre he says in 2000 I spent many evenings in some very cold

[01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:31.840]
days campaigning for Hillary Clinton's election of the West Senate I believe then as I believe now

[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:36.740]
what aligns sounds familiar that senator Clinton had the makings of greatness I carefully

[01:35:36.740 --> 01:35:40.020]
followed senator Clinton's performance in the Senate and during her first several years

[01:35:40.020 --> 01:35:44.360]
enjoyed watching her play the expected role of a quiet freshman her votes were in keeping with

[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:49.460]
her campaign promises and her expectations for her political future were high however as those

[01:35:49.460 --> 01:35:53.860]
of us who study history and politics know events beyond our control often have a way of disrupting

[01:35:53.860 --> 01:35:58.620]
carefully planned agendas and blurring even the clearest divisions those events often call for

[01:35:58.620 --> 01:36:03.020]
the abandonment of otherwise appropriate tentative and cautious approaches and instead require bold

[01:36:03.020 --> 01:36:08.680]
and clear leadership it is here that senator Clinton has disappointed us absolutely correction

[01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:13.040]
prime example is senator Clinton's failure to lead our her actions with regard to the Iraq war

[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:16.940]
instead of questioning the administrations discovery of the actions of evil and the president's

[01:36:16.940 --> 01:36:21.660]
pre-established plan to invade a country with whom we were at peace to further his scheme of regime change in

[01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:26.260]
Iraq senator Clinton along with most of the Congress speedily and without investigation of the facts

[01:36:26.260 --> 01:36:31.260]
advocated its responsibility under constitution and granted broad authority to the executive to

[01:36:31.260 --> 01:36:36.060]
commence and wage war in fact you know the one scene that stands out more than anything else in

[01:36:36.060 --> 01:36:41.820]
why we fight is body birds saying they're in almost empty Senate chamber talking about the strange

[01:36:41.820 --> 01:36:47.060]
irre silences we were brought to embark on his lunacy this madness he said you could hear a

[01:36:47.060 --> 01:36:53.040]
pin drop and you could like that guy bobby bird that old bird to this day the senator insists that

[01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:57.920]
knowing what we know now there were no wmds no connection between 9 11 and so on no purchase of

[01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:01.960]
uranium by Iraq from these year no post invasion plan insufficient troop deployment

[01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:05.680]
manipulation of intelligence findings to support the war a total lack of attention to our

[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:09.820]
understanding of the religious and political situation in Iraq and a childlike belief that there

[01:37:09.820 --> 01:37:14.940]
would be is insignificant opposition in Iraq to our presence that more than 26 hundred American

[01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:19.540]
soldiers have died in this war and that Iraqis are dying at the rate of 100 a day that's one

[01:37:19.540 --> 01:37:24.300]
world trade center death toll every month and that our effort is cost us over 300 billion dollars

[01:37:24.300 --> 01:37:27.760]
and that there's no end in sight that she still would have voted to authorize the invasion

[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:32.180]
instead of the bold leadership required by the president's insane compulsion to invade Iraq

[01:37:32.180 --> 01:37:37.100]
senator Clinton took the easy way out instead of using those enormous talents she demonstrated

[01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:41.440]
his first lady and on the campaign trail she followed the herd that's what I heard

[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:45.800]
unfortunately outside events once again a put the center to the test and again in my opinion

[01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:50.800]
she has come up wanting as a Jew israel is very dear and important to me without question the

[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:54.080]
state of Israel has the right to resist and defend itself without question has been

[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:58.720]
all is acted without provocation imposed as a threat to Jewish and Arab Israelis alike however as

[01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:02.840]
I expect my country the U.S. to demonstrate leadership in the world through policies that create

[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:07.320]
and maintain peace and assist in improving quality life for people around the globe so too do I

[01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:11.760]
expect the nation that symbolizes my heritage israel to lead by example to love peace to respect

[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:16.620]
human life and when armed defense becomes necessary to undertake that task with caution care and

[01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:21.540]
endorses measured to meet the need we expect more from those we love and that goes for nations as

[01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:25.740]
well as individuals when the latest hostilities broke out in northern israel and southern Lebanon

[01:38:25.740 --> 01:38:30.560]
I hope that senator Clinton would speak up for calm for four barrens and for caution instead she

[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:35.480]
said she supported whatever steps are necessary to defend israel we will stand with israel because

[01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:40.680]
israel is standing for american values as well as israeli one she ironically added instead of

[01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:44.880]
using her pulpit to call for an immediate ceasefire she once again fell in lockstep with the

[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:49.740]
busher administration to be politically expedient thing of backing both the u.s. and israeli policy of

[01:38:49.740 --> 01:38:54.120]
using superior military force in a reckless fashion that has killed hundreds of innocent Lebanese

[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:58.760]
civilians over a thousand it is we can the Lebanese over 1300 we can the Lebanese government

[01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:02.500]
and destroy the infrastructure that nation beyond repair in the lifetime of many people who live

[01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:07.180]
there Jonathan Tassini is reing against senator Clinton the democratic primary is written

[01:39:07.180 --> 01:39:11.660]
eloquently about israel under current war Tassini a jew whose father fought in the hagana the

[01:39:11.660 --> 01:39:15.280]
Israeli underground in the war of independence and lived in israel for seven years and still has

[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:19.580]
extensive family there has said a true friend of israel not someone who simply sees votes would

[01:39:19.580 --> 01:39:24.200]
understand that employing collective punishment against people in Lebanon only in bidders of population

[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:28.500]
possibly for generations and then even a short term military victory will be empty if it leaves

[01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:33.180]
behind a shattered country for these and similar comments to see he has been vilified by the

[01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:37.660]
Clinton campaign and her supporters with false accusations that he labeled israel as a terrorist

freaky carloos right okay just a suggestion I'm not trying to like influence the you know your

[01:43:42.220 --> 01:43:49.580]
pool material biggest screamer of mall senator chuck hangel says the GOP has lost its way rhymes with

[01:43:49.580 --> 01:43:54.340]
gate how do you like that Republicans have lost their way when it comes to many core GOP

[01:43:54.340 --> 01:43:59.540]
principles and maybe in jeopardy uh heading into the fall election center chuck hangel Republican

[01:43:59.540 --> 01:44:05.160]
Nebraska says a possible presidential candidate in 2008 hangel said something the GOP today is a

[01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:11.140]
very different party from the one when he first voted Republican first time I voted was in 1968

[01:44:11.140 --> 01:44:15.520]
and top of a tank and a make wrong delto said hangel via non veteran yeah and he's proud of that

[01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:20.180]
I voted a straight Republican ticket that means he voted for Nixon the reason I did is because I

[01:44:20.180 --> 01:44:23.840]
believe in Republican philosophy of governance it's not what it used to be I don't think it's the

[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:29.120]
same today oh yeah good old tricky dick he's proud of that would you come up with that

[01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:33.840]
hall the minute Mitchell and Erlockman and Dean and Chuck Colson all went to jail but somehow Henry

[01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:39.640]
Kissinger who I think is do libren with glasses on how come Henry Kissinger walks free today even

[01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:44.140]
though he's wanted for a murder all over the France that's really all over the world he has

[01:44:44.140 --> 01:44:49.880]
ways he must have ways because every time I see him I say oh you've a take a last where is the

[01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:54.220]
fifth responsibility of the party I joined in 68 whereas the international engagement of the party

[01:44:54.220 --> 01:44:59.180]
I joined fair free trade individual responsibility not building a bigger government but building a

[01:44:59.180 --> 01:45:04.020]
smaller government Iran conquer with Reagan all these other good right wingers his frustration

[01:45:04.020 --> 01:45:07.540]
is not only leading them to think democrats offer a better option wait wait for you see the part

[01:45:07.540 --> 01:45:13.280]
where Nixon and Kissinger are doing their thing to to kidnap and eventually was assassinated the

[01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:18.880]
the head of the Chilean army because they had to get rid of Henry before they could get to

[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:23.160]
all yenday and they eventually didn't of course took a while yenday got elected but about

[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:28.500]
it being there he went we'll see him no more bye bye Salvador hegal hasn't decided whether he'll run

[01:45:28.500 --> 01:45:33.080]
as president in 2008 he says I think republicans are going to be in some jeopardy for and will be

[01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:39.620]
held accountable for losing their way but he liked that and the publicans have lost their way how

[01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:44.960]
about their Kurds that too Kurds are having problems too man especially with those Turks North American

[01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:48.800]
Union threatens you I sovereignly wait when you hear this I don't even know if I should read this

[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:52.820]
allude dogs told us all about it so why don't you what that North American Union

[01:45:52.820 --> 01:45:57.000]
oh did it was he hockered about what I'm sure oh jumping up and down that's right that's right in

[01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:03.360]

[01:46:09.340 --> 01:46:14.320]
you open the bottle you lift the wick up and it would eat it would release this stench into your

[01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:18.980]

have stuff in the gym oh you're talking about generation man you off thing in there I'm talking

[01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:44.900]
about my generation oh yeah that's full-timers talking about my generation man the old

[01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:49.460]
farts can I read this or not go for it by Alan Caruba who would play a hell of a

[01:46:49.460 --> 01:46:54.780]
cheoeba in human events he says the problem with the Bush administration is that not enough of

[01:46:54.780 --> 01:46:59.660]
its officials have read the U.S. Constitution take for example section two of article two when

[01:46:59.660 --> 01:47:03.700]
dealing with four nations it says the president shall have the power buy and with the advice and

[01:47:03.700 --> 01:47:07.340]
consider the Senate to make treaties provided two-thirds of the Senate president concur

[01:47:07.860 --> 01:47:12.020]
so why is president Bush and his administration seeking to establish a North American union that

[01:47:12.020 --> 01:47:18.600]
would in effect abolish the borders between Canada Mexico and the USA moreover would involve

[01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:22.800]
our government and so many common regulatory mandates with these two nations as to render the

[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:27.180]
sovereignty of the U.S. a memory of what national self-governance is supposed to be the name of the

[01:47:27.180 --> 01:47:34.100]
severed is called a security and prosperity partnership of North America SPP not SBTC but SPP

[01:47:34.100 --> 01:47:39.260]
or can't say PP sorry Joyce and guess what has been submitted to the Senate for its oversight

[01:47:39.260 --> 01:47:44.660]
or concurrence because by some magic of governmental definition it is not a treaty instead its

[01:47:44.660 --> 01:47:49.580]
administration is buried in the balls of the Commerce Department it does have however the blessing

[01:47:49.580 --> 01:47:53.860]
of the political and corporate elites of all three nations a visit to the SPP website says it

[01:47:53.860 --> 01:47:58.380]
was launched in March of 2005 as a trial lateral effort to increase security and the handspot

[01:47:58.380 --> 01:48:02.940]
security among the U.S. Canada and Mexico through greater cooperation information sharing it is an

[01:48:02.940 --> 01:48:07.860]
attack on American sovereignty and the smoothest and most soothing writing you'll find anywhere the

[01:48:07.860 --> 01:48:12.760]
website spells out the wonders of SPP they include the North American competitiveness council the

[01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:16.860]
North American Energy Security Initiative the North American Energy Management Plan and plans

[01:48:16.860 --> 01:48:21.920]
for smart secure borders and right now there are working groups whose purpose is to improve productivity

[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:26.720]
reduce the cost of trade and enhance the quality of life and if you like snake oil permit SPP to

[01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:32.260]
sell it to you by the barrel but the box car and by the tanker as well the SPP didn't start out as

[01:48:32.260 --> 01:48:37.320]
an idea the presence of the three nations started kicking around March 23rd 2005 in Waco Texas but

[01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:41.540]
it became the official policy of the U.S. at a special summit convened by Bush and joined by

[01:48:41.540 --> 01:48:46.440]
then-Mexican president of Ascente Fox and Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin like so many really bad

[01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:53.120]
foreign policy concepts SPP Osant's origins to the council on foreign relations the anxious CFR

[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:58.060]
in this case CFR's task force on North America it's report building a North American community

[01:48:58.060 --> 01:49:02.520]
envisions the elimination of U.S. borders in just five years like termite eating with the sovereignty

[01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:07.040]
of the U.S. this grandiose scheme is a major threat to American security and prosperity the

[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:11.980]
Marcus the Marxist major Domo of this task force is Professor Robert Pastor who told the

[01:49:11.980 --> 01:49:16.320]
Santa Form Relations Committee the best way to secure the U.S. today is not that our two borders

[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:21.320]
with Mexico and Canada but at the borders of North America as a whole oh yeah this surely explains

[01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:25.240]
why Mexico is doing such a great job of stopping the drugs muggers or the one million Mexicans

[01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:29.360]
each year consider the U.S. border a mere friction in their pursuit of jobs president Bush keep

[01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:34.080]
selling us Americans won't take this is pure bunk and dangerous bunk at that I mentioned Ludobs was

[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:39.280]
foaming at the mouth over that you should have seen it Alan Perubel was on the say I have many

[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:43.620]
Canadian friends but it seems to me the Canada took too long to discover had some fanatical

[01:49:43.620 --> 01:49:47.560]
Muslims missed who were plotting terrible things frankly I want to cooperate I want us to

[01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:51.240]
cooperate against the economy me but I don't want a place to be responsibility for America's

[01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:56.600]
security in anyone's hands but our own a North American Union promises not only security says SPP

[01:49:56.600 --> 01:50:01.720]
but prosperity too without SPP however the three nations already do more than 800 billion dollars

[01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:07.940]
in trilateral trade surely the U.S. needs Mexico's help to improve our economy as the economist

[01:50:07.940 --> 01:50:12.440]
Robert Samuelson noticed in a June column the subtext for the U.S. immigration debate is Mexico

[01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:16.700]
why doesn't its economy grow faster creating more jobs and higher living standards the answer

[01:50:16.700 --> 01:50:21.320]
that had to do to that has something to do with the economic or the endemic corruption that

[01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:26.040]
infests all levels of Mexico's governmental and business sectors something is very wrong when

[01:50:26.040 --> 01:50:30.640]
Mexico's economy must literally depend on the billions its illegal aliens and home from the U.S.A

[01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:34.940]
kind of sounds like the everything that happens insistently and in most of Italy

[01:50:37.980 --> 01:50:43.420]
unbelievable everything even the soccer games are fixed how do you like that I don't I don't want

[01:50:43.420 --> 01:50:48.020]
to cast no aspersions on those to see yummy but the fact of the matter is even made even their

[01:50:48.020 --> 01:50:53.140]
noses are crooked how do you like that wow it's just a coincidence now that you mention it yeah

[01:50:53.140 --> 01:50:57.460]
just stop and think about it okay talk about your nose out of joint makes me think of my old good

[01:50:57.460 --> 01:51:04.040]

[01:51:14.500 --> 01:51:19.600]
lansky forget about God this was God used to worship and follow him look at it if you walk down

the street they will talk about how slow you walked how fast that he had a dog a cow a horse

[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:31.320]

[01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:40.500]
We're ready to deliver to the poor kids, you.

[01:52:40.860 --> 01:52:43.640]
With your choice, you'll see a point is you.

[01:52:44.060 --> 01:52:46.740]
We need them down to the survival show.

[01:52:47.380 --> 01:52:49.320]
There's hardly a million heroin friends.

[01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:51.580]
And we'll be the slam.

[01:52:52.120 --> 01:52:53.960]
We're just gonna call the way you're born.

[01:52:54.220 --> 01:52:55.400]
Go to hell, we'll die.

[01:52:56.740 --> 01:53:01.300]
We're just gonna call the way you're born.

[01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:02.960]

Dumber than a box of rocks as your president.

[01:53:07.520 --> 01:53:11.700]
By the way, I've seen it part two of the spiky thing

[01:53:11.700 --> 01:53:12.880]
on Katrina's under nine.

[01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:15.060]
I just mentioned that in passing.

[01:53:15.260 --> 01:53:16.560]
You can tell me about that before the show.

[01:53:16.780 --> 01:53:19.240]
The good news is you don't really see him.

[01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:20.060]
At least I didn't.

[01:53:20.100 --> 01:53:23.280]
It's just interviews with people and clips of the news

[01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:24.400]
and the events that took place.

[01:53:24.500 --> 01:53:26.000]
And a lot of the first fights, Jones, myself.

[01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:28.440]
And a lot of things that the news did not show you

[01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:31.460]
because it was two unsavory people using language,

[01:53:31.860 --> 01:53:32.700]
carcasses rotting.

[01:53:32.900 --> 01:53:34.060]
And I can't even know if they're else in there.

[01:53:34.060 --> 01:53:35.380]
I'll bring the spiky Jones and Pinkie Lee.

[01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:37.040]
It's there. It's there.

[01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:37.600]
Look, Pinkie Lee.

[01:53:38.260 --> 01:53:40.840]
Anyway, spiky Lee presents a four-hour chronicle

[01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:42.700]
recounting in this, what the caller was talking about

[01:53:42.700 --> 01:53:44.660]
before we and silly started talking to mumbo jumbo.

[01:53:45.500 --> 01:53:48.520]
About Katrina last night was acts one in two in acts three and four.

[01:53:48.640 --> 01:53:49.640]
Nine o'clock tonight, HB.

[01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:51.600]
Oh, okay.

[01:53:52.980 --> 01:53:54.580]
Speaking of tremendous shows,

[01:53:54.740 --> 01:53:57.360]
they're gonna be coming on your TV very, very soon.

[01:53:57.360 --> 01:53:59.820]
And I say that very, very sarcastically.

[01:54:00.300 --> 01:54:03.840]
And upcoming television special produced by a Christian broadcaster,

[01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:06.360]
one of the worst hate mongers in the history of the human race,

[01:54:06.820 --> 01:54:08.900]
that features conservative punitive and colder,

[01:54:08.980 --> 01:54:10.340]
who may be the worst hate monger,

[01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:13.100]
links Charles Darwin Adal Hitler, raw story is learned.

[01:54:13.560 --> 01:54:13.920]
You see this?

[01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:14.440]
No.

[01:54:15.020 --> 01:54:17.660]
Darwin's deadly legacy, the chilling impact

[01:54:17.660 --> 01:54:19.320]
of Darwin's theory of evolution,

[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:22.800]
coming this weekend to a pathetic TV channel near you.

[01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:27.020]
Author and Christian broadcaster, Dr. D. James Kennedy,

[01:54:27.460 --> 01:54:29.640]
connects the dots between Charles Darwin and Adal Hitler

[01:54:29.640 --> 01:54:30.940]
and Darwin's deadly legacy,

[01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:33.940]
a groundbreaking inquiry into Darwin's chilling social impact,

[01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:37.180]
announced as a press release issued by the Coral Ridge Ministries,

[01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:42.260]
where they have that big, big, gaudy edifice almost to the sky.

[01:54:43.060 --> 01:54:44.700]
You've driven by it many a time, I'm sure.

[01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:46.380]
I don't think I have, but I've seen it on TV.

[01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:47.280]
Get out of here.

[01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:48.420]
All right, bye.

[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:49.560]
Gonna go get some luck.

[01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:52.160]
You never drove by the Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church?

[01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:53.420]
I don't know where it is.

[01:54:53.620 --> 01:54:55.840]
I might have, because 80 million miles up into the sky,

[01:54:55.980 --> 01:54:58.280]
makes the CN Tower look like a pup tent.

[01:54:58.400 --> 01:54:59.360]
I've seen pictures of it.

[01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:00.860]
The new television documentary,

[01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:03.260]
you better get yourself in other parts of Broward

[01:55:03.260 --> 01:55:04.040]
beside Hollywood.

[01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:06.120]
I mean, it's not a lot of places in the town like that.

[01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:06.800]
I don't know.

[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:07.600]
I don't pay attention.

[01:55:07.860 --> 01:55:08.340]
All far.

[01:55:08.580 --> 01:55:09.280]
Yeah, I'm on my way.

[01:55:09.420 --> 01:55:10.800]
Get up there toward a pompano.

[01:55:10.900 --> 01:55:13.880]
Oh yeah, well, we've got people there.

[01:55:14.260 --> 01:55:15.480]
Hey, it's right.

[01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:16.380]
That's right.

[01:55:16.580 --> 01:55:16.580]

[01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:17.240]
For Josh Lies.

[01:55:18.060 --> 01:55:19.120]
I thought you would now let's see.

[01:55:19.220 --> 01:55:20.340]
I can't keep track of you anyway.

[01:55:20.340 --> 01:55:21.480]
You still living with your boyfriend?

[01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:22.940]
What's wrong?

[01:55:22.980 --> 01:55:24.400]
Josh, what's got a male roommate?

[01:55:24.580 --> 01:55:25.480]
Now, the good news is,

[01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:26.880]
a lot of people have roommates, buddy.

[01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:29.220]
Josh and his male roommate live in separate,

[01:55:29.220 --> 01:55:30.920]
they sleep in separate bedrooms.

[01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:32.740]
They don't have bed.

[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:33.360]
Huh?

[01:55:33.480 --> 01:55:35.380]
That's how normal people do it.

[01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:38.640]
As opposed to Sam and Dean in the horrible show

[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:39.740]
that's supernaturally.

[01:55:40.680 --> 01:55:41.780]
I got news for it.

[01:55:42.260 --> 01:55:44.360]
If they were, if they wanted to bunk out here,

[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:45.700]
they could sleep in their own bed,

[01:55:45.780 --> 01:55:47.020]
and might they could sleep on the floor.

[01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:48.540]
Both of them in the tub.

[01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:50.620]
Rub it up, dub.

[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:52.100]
Can I get back to this thing?

[01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:54.020]
Well, I don't want to hear about Josh and his boyfriend.

[01:55:54.660 --> 01:55:55.840]
The new television documentary,

[01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:57.320]
here is, although Josh was something about

[01:55:57.320 --> 01:55:58.700]
he watched the summer of Blue Jiggy,

[01:55:58.840 --> 01:55:59.700]
and you know, it's interesting.

[01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:00.700]
But of course, to show you,

[01:56:00.860 --> 01:56:02.860]
I couldn't care less about the Blue Jigs,

[01:56:02.880 --> 01:56:04.200]
even though I'm here most of the time,

[01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:05.660]
because I don't care about baseball.

[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:08.280]
But when something is on an HD,

[01:56:08.740 --> 01:56:09.540]
you do watch it,

[01:56:09.620 --> 01:56:10.840]
even though ordinarily you might not.

[01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:11.320]
Am I right?

[01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:11.780]
Yes.

[01:56:12.260 --> 01:56:13.320]
It's just amazing.

[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:15.100]
When something is on a high definition,

[01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:17.220]
you're glued with it.

[01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:18.400]
And then every now and then,

[01:56:18.460 --> 01:56:19.540]
you'll accidentally find something.

[01:56:19.740 --> 01:56:21.440]
For example, they had a really interesting show,

[01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:23.100]
a couple nights ago, about Niagara Falls.

[01:56:23.900 --> 01:56:25.600]
And about these guys that tried to make this

[01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:27.440]
makeshift camera that was going to like,

[01:56:27.620 --> 01:56:28.680]
to go over the falls.

[01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:31.120]
And the whole thing was just amazing.

[01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:32.180]
You had to be there.

[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:33.080]
And it was an HD.

[01:56:33.580 --> 01:56:35.020]
And you felt like you were going right off the edge,

[01:56:35.200 --> 01:56:36.460]
right after losing your acid falls to you.

[01:56:36.580 --> 01:56:38.580]
Yeah, discovery HD is probably the best channel.

[01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:39.720]
Yeah, absolutely.

[01:56:40.100 --> 01:56:41.360]
And then there are PBS, too,

[01:56:41.580 --> 01:56:42.520]
who got you in good crap.

[01:56:43.020 --> 01:56:44.040]
It fits an HD, man.

[01:56:44.140 --> 01:56:44.480]
I'm there.

[01:56:45.020 --> 01:56:46.780]
Although I wish I'd been there a little bit later on,

[01:56:46.780 --> 01:56:48.160]
to see the big countertoms between.

[01:56:48.500 --> 01:56:49.900]
I wish I had to see him any heavy Yankeball

[01:56:49.900 --> 01:56:51.740]
out of Tilly's hand, Lily.

[01:56:52.220 --> 01:56:52.600]
Eli Lilly.

[01:56:53.420 --> 01:56:56.740]
I wonder if Ted Lilly's got a pear-shaped ass, you know?

[01:56:57.580 --> 01:56:59.420]
That would tell us a lot about why he's so bad

[01:56:59.420 --> 01:57:00.340]
and can't get anybody out.

[01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:01.000]
He really stinks.

[01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:03.920]
And I was going on a $55 million for AJ Burnett.

[01:57:04.020 --> 01:57:05.080]
And I was going to go out there, Blue Jays.

[01:57:05.180 --> 01:57:05.900]
You guys are idiots.

[01:57:06.540 --> 01:57:08.060]
Author and Christian Broadcaster,

[01:57:08.180 --> 01:57:12.000]
Dr. D. James Kennedy, a real, real evil person,

[01:57:12.340 --> 01:57:13.140]
an evil doer,

[01:57:13.580 --> 01:57:15.720]
connects the dots between Charles Darwin and Adolf Hitler.

[01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:17.020]
And Darwin's deadly legacy,

[01:57:17.380 --> 01:57:19.060]
a groundbreaking inquiry into Darwin's

[01:57:19.060 --> 01:57:21.040]
chilling social impact on us as a press release issued

[01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:21.920]
by Crow Ridge Ministries,

[01:57:22.300 --> 01:57:24.560]
the new TV documentary airs nationwide this weekend,

[01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:25.940]
August 26th and 27th,

[01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:27.360]
on the Crow Ridge Hour.

[01:57:27.860 --> 01:57:28.740]
To put it simply,

[01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:31.520]
no Darwin, no Hitler says Dr. Kennedy.

[01:57:32.020 --> 01:57:33.260]
Hitler tried to speed up evolution

[01:57:33.260 --> 01:57:33.960]
to help it along,

[01:57:34.040 --> 01:57:36.160]
and millions suffered and died non-speakable ways because of it.

[01:57:36.420 --> 01:57:37.900]
Let me put it this way to you, Dr. Kennedy.

[01:57:38.260 --> 01:57:39.980]
No Dr. Kennedy, no James Dopson,

[01:57:40.140 --> 01:57:41.600]
no Jerry Falwell, no Pat Robertson,

[01:57:41.900 --> 01:57:42.600]
no religious nuts,

[01:57:42.900 --> 01:57:43.940]
no Hayton murder in the world.

[01:57:43.940 --> 01:57:46.040]
Ah, 14 scholars,

[01:57:46.300 --> 01:57:47.000]
scientists and no pulp,

[01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:49.260]
14 scholars, scientists and authors,

[01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:50.100]
featured on the show,

[01:57:50.280 --> 01:57:53.260]
outlined the grim consequences of Darwin's theory of evolution

[01:57:53.260 --> 01:57:55.460]
and show how his theory fueled Hitler's ovens

[01:57:55.460 --> 01:57:56.640]
according to the press release.

[01:57:57.360 --> 01:57:59.040]
I bet you're just going to be glued to that, aren't you?

[01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:00.060]
Sure.

[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:02.360]
Other participants include

[01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:05.260]
from Darwin to Hitler author and California State University,

[01:58:05.400 --> 01:58:07.980]
Modern European History Professor Richard Wichert,

[01:58:08.120 --> 01:58:09.280]
along with Michael B. He,

[01:58:09.660 --> 01:58:10.880]
who wrote Darwin's black box,

[01:58:11.420 --> 01:58:13.480]
and is a permanently-setted source against evolution

[01:58:13.480 --> 01:58:14.660]
and Coltrus's latest book,

[01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:17.540]
of course, she's living proof that evolution doesn't exist.

[01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:18.900]
In a recent study,

[01:58:19.100 --> 01:58:20.760]
Media Matters argued that Coltrus end notes

[01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:22.640]
were right for distortions and falsehoods.

[01:58:22.820 --> 01:58:23.540]
Well, last part of respect,

[01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:24.920]
that's for speciality,

[01:58:25.060 --> 01:58:26.000]
that's for part and parcel.

[01:58:26.420 --> 01:58:26.540]
Right.

[01:58:26.980 --> 01:58:29.740]
This show basically is about the social-affected Darwinism

[01:58:29.740 --> 01:58:30.800]
and shows this idea,

[01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:32.340]
which is scientifically bankrupt,

[01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:34.900]
has probably been responsible for more bloodshed

[01:58:34.900 --> 01:58:36.660]
than anything else in the history of humanity,

[01:58:36.900 --> 01:58:37.580]
one of the show's producers,

[01:58:37.860 --> 01:58:39.220]
Jerry Nukham told WorldNet Daily.

[01:58:39.880 --> 01:58:41.220]
By the way, how did you like in,

[01:58:41.300 --> 01:58:43.040]
why we fight the thing about Truman?

[01:58:43.040 --> 01:58:45.520]
Then the fact that he dropped the nukes on the jabs,

[01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:46.160]
because he wanted to,

[01:58:46.200 --> 01:58:47.140]
and he wanted to scare Stalin?

[01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:48.520]
Sure, for work?

[01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:48.720]
Yeah.

[01:58:49.640 --> 01:58:50.540]
Worked like a charm.

[01:58:50.700 --> 01:58:52.460]
Clip from the special can be seen at this link,

[01:58:52.560 --> 01:58:53.180]
instead of link to it.

[01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:55.240]
We keep hearing about gaps in the theory of evolution,

[01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:56.100]
Coltrus says in the clip,

[01:58:56.420 --> 01:58:57.380]
the whole theory is a gap.

[01:58:58.220 --> 01:58:58.380]
Yeah.

[01:58:58.740 --> 01:58:59.460]
And guess what you are,

[01:58:59.580 --> 01:59:00.300]
and rhymes with gap.

[01:59:00.780 --> 01:59:01.560]
That's what you are.

[01:59:01.820 --> 01:59:02.380]
See, I think you're wrong,

[01:59:02.480 --> 01:59:03.160]
because I think in the future,

[01:59:03.280 --> 01:59:04.180]
there won't be two genders,

[01:59:04.300 --> 01:59:05.020]
and she's living proof.

[01:59:05.860 --> 01:59:07.120]
Oh, she's the old gender-bender.

[01:59:07.280 --> 01:59:08.320]
She's the poor one.

[01:59:08.640 --> 01:59:09.160]
She's the gender-bender.

[01:59:09.800 --> 01:59:11.320]
In fact, just why she just bent over,

[01:59:11.460 --> 01:59:12.260]
so we know stick her feet

[01:59:12.260 --> 01:59:13.200]
where the moon don't shine.

[01:59:13.440 --> 01:59:14.820]
Or just stick some moon shine up in there.

[01:59:15.080 --> 01:59:15.420]
Couldn't hurt.

[01:59:15.940 --> 01:59:18.100]
Ever see her and John Mark Harde together?

[01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:18.500]
Same part.

[01:59:18.500 --> 01:59:19.060]
Oh, it was a good point.

[01:59:19.640 --> 01:59:21.560]
He's got a better attitude.

[01:59:22.140 --> 01:59:22.140]

[01:59:22.180 --> 01:59:22.520]
By far.

[01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:23.980]
Coltrus carries on the theme

[01:59:23.980 --> 01:59:26.560]
from her best-selling book released in June on 666,

[01:59:27.220 --> 01:59:29.320]
which attacks liberalism as a godless religion.

[01:59:29.880 --> 01:59:31.580]
I think Darwinism is popular as a story,

[01:59:31.720 --> 01:59:33.400]
because it allows atheists not to have to explain

[01:59:33.400 --> 01:59:34.800]
while we're here, Coltrus isn't as special.

[01:59:35.140 --> 01:59:36.240]
There's no such thing as morality.

[01:59:36.720 --> 01:59:39.020]
There's no such thing as our consciousness of our own morality,

[01:59:39.380 --> 01:59:41.160]
where about one step above of a purpose, Coltrus,

[01:59:41.160 --> 01:59:42.780]
or ads, all the many of them seem to believe

[01:59:42.780 --> 01:59:44.640]
we're below a purpose because we have nooks,

[01:59:44.880 --> 01:59:46.960]
and we pollute, and we hate crimes, and don't recycle.

[01:59:47.240 --> 01:59:47.760]
We have hate crimes.

[01:59:48.200 --> 01:59:49.940]
I say we're several steps below a purpose.

[01:59:50.100 --> 01:59:50.940]
I'm saying that on purpose.

[01:59:51.540 --> 01:59:52.740]
How about below a dolphin?

[01:59:53.480 --> 01:59:55.800]
Coltrus has been widely criticized for attacks on,

[01:59:55.840 --> 01:59:57.320]
as Scrooan used to be into that.

[01:59:57.880 --> 01:59:58.220]
Dolphins?

[01:59:58.620 --> 01:59:59.600]
Being below dolphins.

[02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:02.420]
Coltrus has been widely criticized for attacks

[02:00:02.420 --> 02:00:03.780]
and Darwin's theory of evolution,

[02:00:03.940 --> 02:00:06.260]
which he called one night of a Scientology

[02:00:06.260 --> 02:00:07.900]
and Scientific Ritter in her book.

[02:00:08.300 --> 02:00:11.080]
What's annoying about Coltrus is that he insistently

[02:00:11.080 --> 02:00:13.220]
demands evidence for evolution, none of which he'll ever accept,

[02:00:13.540 --> 02:00:16.160]
but requires not a shred of evidence for alternative hypothesis

[02:00:16.160 --> 02:00:19.120]
for Professor Jury Coyne from the University of Chicago

[02:00:19.120 --> 02:00:21.580]
with the Department of Ecology and Evolution in a recent book review.

[02:00:22.100 --> 02:00:24.640]
According to the ministry's website, the Coral Ridge Hour

[02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:27.080]
airs on more than 400 stations, four cable networks,

[02:00:27.500 --> 02:00:30.100]
and to 165 nations on the Armed Forces Network,

[02:00:30.360 --> 02:00:33.460]
and is the third most widely syndicated weekly Christian television program.

[02:00:33.900 --> 02:00:37.000]
The show also runs on zone Foxone TV stations as a paid program.

[02:00:37.540 --> 02:00:40.000]
Christian Coral Ridge Ministry's threefold mission is to be evangelized,

[02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:42.820]
nurture Christian growth and biblical instruction,

[02:00:43.120 --> 02:00:46.020]
and reform American culture by applying the truth of Scripture to all life,

[02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:49.540]
including civic affairs reads the above page at the ministry's website.

[02:00:49.860 --> 02:00:52.980]
I guess they left out the part about spreading hate and intolerance.

[02:00:53.700 --> 02:00:54.640]
Right, which they do best.

[02:00:54.860 --> 02:00:56.220]
That's the specialty, man.

[02:00:56.680 --> 02:00:57.820]
Spreading hate and intolerance.

[02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:00.320]
And of course, being in bed with a sick bitch like that,

[02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:01.960]
like her, and of course, isn't interested in it.

[02:01:02.020 --> 02:01:03.200]
She and Ms. Fajar best of buddies.

[02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:06.020]
I wonder what position Lynn Samuel's takes in that,

[02:01:06.020 --> 02:01:07.780]
a whole deal, huh?

[02:01:08.020 --> 02:01:09.000]
Pivot, she's the pivot man.

[02:01:09.160 --> 02:01:10.040]
Is she the pivot guy?

[02:01:10.700 --> 02:01:11.980]
Kenneth Smas macho, baby.

[02:01:12.320 --> 02:01:15.300]
Janorino Lynn Samuel's and co-man coder.

[02:01:15.620 --> 02:01:16.520]
Who might I leave him out?

[02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:17.500]
I'll leave out Janorino?

[02:01:17.800 --> 02:01:18.160]
John Card.

[02:01:19.020 --> 02:01:22.300]
Oh, he's not even in the mix, is they say?

[02:01:22.800 --> 02:01:23.740]
He's not even in the mix.

[02:01:24.380 --> 02:01:27.120]
In fact, I got news for even Tom Mix was more much of than he was.

[02:01:28.220 --> 02:01:30.120]
1242 at 560 W.Q.A.M.

[02:01:30.220 --> 02:01:31.940]
No, nobody's got the SPTC, man.

[02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:33.980]
He's just the usual bunch of assorted mutt-davit, huh?

[02:01:33.980 --> 02:01:36.120]
He must have been having a really healthy good summer run these days.

[02:01:36.120 --> 02:01:37.020]
Oh, yes, exactly.

[02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:41.420]
Hey, let me tell you, going back to school can be a little rough on the kids in a good night's sleep

[02:01:41.420 --> 02:01:44.440]
as critical for the development of healthy minds, or even marginal minds.

[02:01:44.580 --> 02:01:47.100]
If your kids are having trouble adjusting to school night bed time,

[02:01:47.180 --> 02:01:49.760]
it just might be that they're sleeping on a lousy mattress, man.

[02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:52.060]
They're tossing and churning and humping and bumping.

[02:01:52.480 --> 02:01:55.140]
Anyway, called Donald mattress, toll free at 1-800-MATRUS,

[02:01:55.520 --> 02:01:58.060]

CERTA Simmons King Coral, temperpidic and sternum and foster.

[02:02:18.580 --> 02:02:19.400]
I've been using them for years.

[02:02:19.400 --> 02:02:21.480]
It's the easiest and the smartest piece of shopping,

[02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:24.220]
no wasting expensive gas, no getting all slept,

[02:02:24.620 --> 02:02:28.620]
worked up to a frantic frenzy in a tremendous heat and humidity.

[02:02:29.060 --> 02:02:31.200]
All you do is sit there on your fan and make one easy call.

[02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:34.040]

I'm Chris. You can be sleeping on that new bed as soon as tonight.

[02:02:38.880 --> 02:02:41.480]
Call 1-800-MATRUS MATTRES,

[02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:45.040]
leave off the last as because it stands for sales hole sarner.

[02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:47.540]
This is Neil Roger.

[02:02:47.780 --> 02:02:52.100]
Oh, this is 5.62-A-S.

[02:02:53.780 --> 02:02:56.240]
Am I Junior, honey?

[02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:01.080]
The other new Christian have came.

[02:03:03.540 --> 02:03:06.080]
George Bush is our Christad King.

[02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:11.560]
We are right out in the Ritmak Womps.

[02:03:13.880 --> 02:03:16.500]
Praise to the hourbrings of darkness.

[02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:21.380]
To sacrifice, we must ingest.

[02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:26.280]
The body and blood of full will splash.

[02:03:28.580 --> 02:03:32.300]
Bush is Lord and Divorra's life, which are in the highest.

[02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:39.460]
He says, Lord, Divorra's life, is out in the highest.

[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:42.240]
He says, Lord, Divorra's life, is out in the highest.

[02:03:43.260 --> 02:03:45.200]
He says, Lord, Divorra's life, is out in the highest.

[02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:47.700]
He says, Lord, Divorra's life, is out in the highest.

[02:03:54.580 --> 02:03:56.340]
I'm dying on the hand.

[02:03:56.860 --> 02:03:57.600]
How's that pool coming?

[02:03:58.100 --> 02:04:00.280]
Who should the Democrats run for president in 2008?

[02:04:00.620 --> 02:04:02.900]
I realize two years, how are we going to survive two years?

[02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:03.760]
I don't know.

[02:04:04.180 --> 02:04:04.460]
Carefully.

[02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:06.560]
Here's the big news.

[02:04:06.760 --> 02:04:07.700]
Here's the bulletin.

[02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:09.940]
Hold on, I have a big bulletin.

[02:04:10.760 --> 02:04:12.040]
There's something missing.

[02:04:12.460 --> 02:04:12.460]

[02:04:12.460 --> 02:04:16.260]
So the prosecutor and the Boulder must have something up her sleeve.

[02:04:16.380 --> 02:04:19.380]
She must have a real ace card to play.

[02:04:19.840 --> 02:04:20.400]
What do you think?

[02:04:21.420 --> 02:04:24.460]
I think that what happened here in the AC is that somebody...

[02:04:25.020 --> 02:04:26.140]
The SBTC, maybe...

[02:04:26.140 --> 02:04:27.600]
The investigation was going on.

[02:04:28.040 --> 02:04:31.260]
I think that the Boulder D.A.'s office was gathering its evidence.

[02:04:31.460 --> 02:04:32.920]
They were gathering up Mr. Carr.

[02:04:32.920 --> 02:04:35.140]
They were getting ready to...

[02:04:35.140 --> 02:04:36.400]
Is that like gathering trust notes?

[02:04:36.520 --> 02:04:38.560]
You should end up doing it the way most investigations have done.

[02:04:38.740 --> 02:04:39.500]
Even if it's gathering notes.

[02:04:39.680 --> 02:04:40.420]
Media screwed me.

[02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:44.280]
Someone chipped the media and then there was a hastily called press conference.

[02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:45.480]
Small balls take charge.

[02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:49.060]
This was not a press conference that said, we got on there.

[02:04:49.340 --> 02:04:49.340]

[02:04:49.540 --> 02:04:52.060]
This was a press conference that said, hang on it.

[02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:53.960]
We should be arrest one because of the guy...

[02:04:53.960 --> 02:04:56.140]
I don't think he needs this exchange operation.

[02:04:56.300 --> 02:04:58.820]
I did not tell you that the first time I've seen him there on the day...

[02:04:58.820 --> 02:04:59.220]
Yes, you did.

[02:04:59.300 --> 02:04:59.580]
On me.

[02:04:59.820 --> 02:05:00.700]
You can spot him.

[02:05:00.700 --> 02:05:01.500]
You're out of that.

[02:05:01.700 --> 02:05:03.360]
No, I said, I don't think he's got a f***.

[02:05:03.440 --> 02:05:04.560]
I don't know how they got the three kids.

[02:05:04.680 --> 02:05:09.300]
Oh, and also, how come we're not hearing more about the delivery of the twins who died at birth?

[02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:10.460]
You know who delivered the twins?

[02:05:11.140 --> 02:05:11.960]
No, you passed.

[02:05:12.080 --> 02:05:12.360]
He did.

[02:05:12.880 --> 02:05:13.240]
Oh.

[02:05:13.840 --> 02:05:14.200]
Oh.

[02:05:14.660 --> 02:05:16.240]
And they died at birth, I say.

[02:05:17.180 --> 02:05:17.740]
Uh-huh.

[02:05:18.600 --> 02:05:20.180]
And we're hearing very little about that.

[02:05:20.280 --> 02:05:21.640]
But I'm sure we'll hear lots more.

[02:05:21.700 --> 02:05:22.720]
More than you could ever imagine.

[02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:23.960]
More than you could ever want.

[02:05:24.400 --> 02:05:25.580]
More than anybody could ever want.

[02:05:25.720 --> 02:05:27.420]
Because this is norm early now.

[02:05:27.500 --> 02:05:29.220]
If somebody took the...

[02:05:29.220 --> 02:05:30.380]
I wonder if he's came to early win.

[02:05:30.440 --> 02:05:36.600]
It's impossible at this point to conduct the investigation in a clandestine fashion to

[02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:40.360]
assume that she would not have arrested the man but...

[02:05:40.960 --> 02:05:42.140]
1151 votes on the pool.

[02:05:42.520 --> 02:05:46.280]
What was this pool had to do with John Bane and John Mark Carren, the Passy and the...

[02:05:46.280 --> 02:05:48.000]
Don't be a Passy man like the Harvey Oswald.

[02:05:48.460 --> 02:05:49.180]
Just a Passy.

[02:05:49.620 --> 02:05:49.700]
Right.

[02:05:49.940 --> 02:05:51.620]
Who should the Democrats run in 2008?

[02:05:51.760 --> 02:05:52.360]
Not who do you like?

[02:05:52.840 --> 02:05:53.500]
Not who can win.

[02:05:53.760 --> 02:05:54.440]
But who should they run?

[02:05:54.540 --> 02:05:55.620]
Which I guess means who can win.

[02:05:55.620 --> 02:05:58.860]
Al Gore 319 winning in a glanslide.

[02:05:59.420 --> 02:06:00.760]
Howard Dean 1171.

[02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:01.840]
Couple of screamers.

[02:06:02.100 --> 02:06:03.620]
I don't care 139.

[02:06:03.740 --> 02:06:05.740]
12% of you don't care enough to send your very best.

[02:06:05.820 --> 02:06:06.500]
Well, I'll post to you.

[02:06:06.700 --> 02:06:06.820]
Okay.

[02:06:07.080 --> 02:06:08.060]
Just like I said to the beast.

[02:06:09.480 --> 02:06:10.620]
Barack Obama 117.

[02:06:11.780 --> 02:06:12.500]
Hillary 105.

[02:06:13.020 --> 02:06:14.660]
By the way, that's a raspberry in case you're not...

[02:06:14.660 --> 02:06:16.560]
That's my fruit as opposed to a strawberry.

[02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:17.180]
Right.

[02:06:17.360 --> 02:06:20.320]
Hillary 105 as opposed to a poisonberry.

[02:06:21.060 --> 02:06:22.340]
John Edwards 88.

[02:06:22.340 --> 02:06:23.780]
Joe Biden 74.

[02:06:24.240 --> 02:06:25.460]
Russ Finegold 42.

[02:06:25.640 --> 02:06:27.600]
What I tell you about him, passing John Currie.

[02:06:28.240 --> 02:06:28.860]
Not even close.

[02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:31.700]
He even passed Elliot Spitzer, the other Jew boy on there.

[02:06:32.120 --> 02:06:33.120]
Elliot Spitzer 37.

[02:06:33.560 --> 02:06:34.600]
I hit this poll 34.

[02:06:34.780 --> 02:06:35.620]
2.9%.

[02:06:35.620 --> 02:06:38.500]
And John Currie, in fact, the last time we did the CLS,

[02:06:38.540 --> 02:06:39.260]
came in diddle last.

[02:06:39.400 --> 02:06:40.360]
They distant last.

[02:06:41.200 --> 02:06:41.840]
Distant last.

[02:06:42.080 --> 02:06:42.660]
How do you like that?

[02:06:43.180 --> 02:06:43.820]
That's a lot of love.

[02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000]
An amazing part of it is he won the 2004 election.

[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.380]
Only they juice up the votes in Ohio.

[02:06:49.160 --> 02:06:49.860]
Currie 26.

[02:06:50.200 --> 02:06:50.800]
Maybe it's...

[02:06:50.800 --> 02:06:52.040]
Well, no, I was going to say it.

[02:06:52.040 --> 02:06:52.640]
Maybe it's just a vote.

[02:06:52.640 --> 02:06:53.420]
It's not just as well.

[02:06:54.200 --> 02:06:56.320]
Even if Mortimer snored would have been run into it,

[02:06:56.340 --> 02:06:57.760]
would have been improvement over what we got now.

[02:06:58.160 --> 02:06:59.560]
Pop had Clinton look or we got kids.

[02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:01.720]
Pop had Al Gore look or we got.

[02:07:02.120 --> 02:07:03.720]
Oh, Dick Cheney.

[02:07:03.920 --> 02:07:04.500]
Good God.

[02:07:05.320 --> 02:07:07.020]
With his lesbian daughter Mary, by the way,

[02:07:07.020 --> 02:07:08.060]
I just mentioned it in passing.

[02:07:08.200 --> 02:07:09.400]
Nothing's there's anything wrong with that.

[02:07:09.460 --> 02:07:10.080]
You're fairie.

[02:07:10.220 --> 02:07:11.020]
Check out the look, Lebanese.

[02:07:11.540 --> 02:07:13.920]
Frank Rich, no relation to fat rich, rest in peace.

[02:07:14.540 --> 02:07:16.880]
In New York Times, writes five years after 9-11,

[02:07:17.080 --> 02:07:18.380]
fear finally strikes out.

[02:07:19.660 --> 02:07:21.820]
The results are in for the White House's latest efforts

[02:07:21.820 --> 02:07:23.740]
to exploit terrorism for political gain.

[02:07:24.120 --> 02:07:26.780]
The era of Americans fearing fear itself is over.

[02:07:27.340 --> 02:07:28.820]
In each poll released since the falling

[02:07:28.820 --> 02:07:30.320]
of the Transatlantic Terror Plot,

[02:07:30.460 --> 02:07:32.560]
Gallup Newsweek, CBS, I'd be Pew.

[02:07:33.620 --> 02:07:36.140]
George W. Bush's approval rate remains stuck in the 30s.

[02:07:36.140 --> 02:07:37.000]
BOTS 30, man!

[02:07:37.020 --> 02:07:38.720]
Justice has been with a little let up

[02:07:38.720 --> 02:07:40.820]
as in the year since Katrina stripped the last remaining

[02:07:40.820 --> 02:07:42.740]
fig leaf of credibility from his presidency.

[02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:45.140]
While the new Middle East promised by Condi,

[02:07:45.240 --> 02:07:46.440]
writes remains a delusion.

[02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:48.660]
The death rattle of the domestic political order

[02:07:48.660 --> 02:07:50.740]
we've lived with since 9-11 can be thought everywhere.

[02:07:50.740 --> 02:07:53.560]
In Americans, unhistorical reactions to the terror plot.

[02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.380]
In politicians and puppets hysterical overreact

[02:07:56.380 --> 02:07:57.880]
to Joe Lieberman's defeat in Connecticut,

[02:07:58.340 --> 02:08:00.100]
even in the Ho-Hombs Box Office reaction

[02:08:00.100 --> 02:08:02.160]
to Oliver Stone's World Trade Center.

[02:08:02.620 --> 02:08:04.920]
It's not as if the White House didn't put all the stops

[02:08:04.920 --> 02:08:07.380]
to move the terror plot to further its politics of fear.

[02:08:07.920 --> 02:08:10.680]
One self-congratulatory presidential photo op was out

[02:08:10.680 --> 02:08:12.860]
of the National Counterterrorism Center,

[02:08:13.180 --> 02:08:14.920]
a dead ringer for the set in 24.

[02:08:15.460 --> 02:08:17.760]
But Mr. Bush's Jack Bowers no more persuasive

[02:08:17.760 --> 02:08:19.240]
than his Tom Cruise of Top Gun.

[02:08:19.240 --> 02:08:21.680]
By crying wolf about terrorism way too often,

[02:08:21.980 --> 02:08:24.360]
usually when a distraction is needed from bad news in Iraq,

[02:08:24.800 --> 02:08:27.520]
he and his administration have long since become comedy fodder

[02:08:27.520 --> 02:08:29.020]
and not just on the daily show.

[02:08:29.520 --> 02:08:31.600]
June's scenario was particularly choice.

[02:08:32.180 --> 02:08:35.180]
As Baghdad imploded, Albert O'Gonzala's breathlessly

[02:08:35.180 --> 02:08:37.840]
unmasked Amami Terrisale plotting a full-ground war

[02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:39.560]
and the destruction of the serious tower,

[02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:41.960]
even though the alleged cell had no concrete plans,

[02:08:42.320 --> 02:08:43.660]
no contacts with terrorist networks,

[02:08:44.040 --> 02:08:45.260]
no equipment including boots.

[02:08:46.120 --> 02:08:47.740]
While makes the four of London Pakistan

[02:08:47.740 --> 02:08:49.380]
thought seem more of a serious threat,

[02:08:49.580 --> 02:08:52.000]
though not so serious as disrupted Tony Blair's vacation,

[02:08:52.620 --> 02:08:53.900]
is that the British vouch for it,

[02:08:54.020 --> 02:08:56.260]
not Attorney General Gonzalez and his Keystone cops.

[02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.380]
This didn't stop Michael Churro from grabbing credit

[02:08:59.380 --> 02:09:01.920]
in his promotional sprint through last Sunday's talk shows.

[02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:04.820]
It was as if we had an opportunity to stop 9-11 before,

[02:09:04.900 --> 02:09:06.060]
and actually it was carried out, he said,

[02:09:06.420 --> 02:09:08.260]
insiduating himself into that royal weave.

[02:09:08.740 --> 02:09:11.320]
But no matter how persistent is invocation of 9-11,

[02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:14.040]
our Secretary of Homeland Security is too discredited

[02:09:14.040 --> 02:09:16.540]
to impress a public that has been plenty disillusioned

[02:09:16.540 --> 02:09:18.420]
since Karl Rhofer's exhibited the flag-rate

[02:09:18.420 --> 02:09:19.880]
remains of a World Trade Center victim

[02:09:19.880 --> 02:09:21.880]
in a 2004 campaign commercial.

[02:09:22.200 --> 02:09:24.280]
We looked at Mr. Churro often, still see the man

[02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:26.300]
who couldn't figure out what was happening in New Orleans

[02:09:26.300 --> 02:09:27.960]
when the catastrophe was being broadcast

[02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:29.780]
in real time on live TV.

[02:09:30.420 --> 02:09:31.900]
No matter what the threat was at hand,

[02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:33.120]
he can't get his story straight.

[02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:35.780]
When he said last weekend that the 40 of London

[02:09:35.780 --> 02:09:37.520]
plot revealed Al-Qaeda in this array

[02:09:37.520 --> 02:09:40.080]
because it's been five years since they've been capable

[02:09:40.080 --> 02:09:41.660]
of putting together something of this sort,

[02:09:42.080 --> 02:09:44.080]
it didn't seem to realize that he was flatly contradicting

[02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:47.500]
the Ashcroff Gonzalez claim for the gravity of all the Al-Qaeda plots

[02:09:47.500 --> 02:09:49.260]
they'd boasted to stopping in those five years.

[02:09:50.220 --> 02:09:51.640]
As recently as last October,

[02:09:52.080 --> 02:09:55.060]
Mr. Bush himself announced a list of 10 grizzly four-of-plots

[02:09:55.060 --> 02:09:57.520]
including one he later described as a Qaeda plan

[02:09:57.520 --> 02:09:59.820]
ready to set into motion to fly a hijack plane

[02:09:59.820 --> 02:10:01.360]
under the tallest building on the west coast.

[02:10:02.360 --> 02:10:04.500]
Dick Chaney's credibility is also nil,

[02:10:04.600 --> 02:10:06.340]
he'll always be the man who told us that Iraqis

[02:10:06.340 --> 02:10:07.700]
would weed our troops as liberators

[02:10:07.700 --> 02:10:10.860]
and that the insurgency was in last throes in May of last year.

[02:10:11.380 --> 02:10:13.100]
His latest and predictable effort to exploit

[02:10:13.100 --> 02:10:14.880]
terrorism for election year fear mongering,

[02:10:15.260 --> 02:10:18.540]
arguing that Nidaleemans descent on Iraq gave comfort to Al-Qaeda types

[02:10:18.540 --> 02:10:21.280]
has no traction because the public has long since untangled

[02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:24.440]
the administration's bogus linkage between the Iraq war and Al-Qaeda.

[02:10:25.300 --> 02:10:27.220]
That's why I have all the pull finding signs to it.

[02:10:27.320 --> 02:10:29.200]
The most revealing was one of the CBS survey

[02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:31.460]
while the percentage of Americans who chose terrorism

[02:10:31.460 --> 02:10:33.200]
as our most important problem increased

[02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:35.220]
in the immediate aftermath of the London plot,

[02:10:35.700 --> 02:10:40.080]
terrorism still came in second and only 17% to Iraq at 28%.

[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:42.300]
The administration's constant referring that Iraq

[02:10:42.300 --> 02:10:45.160]
is the central front in the war on terror is not only false,

[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:46.800]
but now is also backfired politically.

[02:10:47.200 --> 02:10:49.840]
Only 9% of the CBS poll felt that our involvement in Iraq

[02:10:49.840 --> 02:10:51.180]
was helping decrease terrorism.

[02:10:51.660 --> 02:10:53.180]
As its fifth anniversary arrives,

[02:10:53.620 --> 02:10:55.880]
9-11 itself has been dwarfed by the Mayhem in Iraq,

[02:10:56.220 --> 02:10:59.220]
where more civilians are not killed per month than died in the attack on America.

[02:10:59.700 --> 02:11:01.460]
The box office returns of World Trade Center

[02:11:01.460 --> 02:11:04.520]
or a cultural sign of just how much America has moved on.

[02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:06.800]
For all the debate about whether it was too soon

[02:11:06.800 --> 02:11:07.920]
for such a Hollywood movie,

[02:11:08.300 --> 02:11:09.260]
it did better in the northeast

[02:11:09.260 --> 02:11:11.980]
where such concerns were most prevalent than in the rest of the country

[02:11:11.980 --> 02:11:14.260]
where like United 93, it may have arrived too late.

[02:11:14.780 --> 02:11:16.640]
Despite wild acclaim from conservatives

[02:11:16.640 --> 02:11:19.400]
and an accompanying email campaign, World Trade Center

[02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:20.700]
couldn't have drawn a step up,

[02:11:21.100 --> 02:11:23.620]
a teen romance starring a former Evercrawby and Fitch model,

[02:11:24.160 --> 02:11:25.840]
and playing on 500 fewer screens.

[02:11:26.700 --> 02:11:29.520]
Mr. Lamont's victory in the Connecticut Democratic Senatorial primary

[02:11:29.520 --> 02:11:31.480]
has been overhyped as Mr. Stone's movie.

[02:11:31.820 --> 02:11:33.400]
As a bellwether of national politics,

[02:11:33.780 --> 02:11:36.200]
one artist primary and one very blue state is nearly meaningless.

[02:11:36.700 --> 02:11:38.540]
Mr. Lieberman starved again to waning Connecticut

[02:11:38.540 --> 02:11:40.540]
well before Iraq became a defining issue,

[02:11:40.540 --> 02:11:43.240]
is appropriating at home as mentioned by the Quinnipiac Polar

[02:11:43.240 --> 02:11:47.360]
that fallen from 80% in 2000 to 51% in July of 2003,

[02:11:47.780 --> 02:11:50.220]
and that was before his kamikaze presidential bid turned

[02:11:50.220 --> 02:11:52.160]
joe mintem into a national joke.

[02:11:52.720 --> 02:11:55.480]
The hyperbole that has greeted the Lamont victory in some quarters

[02:11:55.480 --> 02:11:57.300]
is far more revealing than the victory itself.

[02:11:57.900 --> 02:12:00.600]
In 2006, the tired rose strategy of equating

[02:12:00.600 --> 02:12:02.840]
any Democratic politicians opposition to the Iraq War

[02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:05.600]
with cut and run defeatism in the war in terror looks desperate.

[02:12:06.020 --> 02:12:07.680]
The Republicans are protesting too much,

[02:12:07.680 --> 02:12:10.120]
me thinks, a former Greenwich select man like Mr. Lamont

[02:12:10.120 --> 02:12:13.080]
isn't easily slined as reincarnation of Abby Hoffman

[02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:14.400]
or an ally of Osama bin Laden.

[02:12:15.220 --> 02:12:17.580]
What Republicans really see Mr. Lieberman's loss is not

[02:12:17.580 --> 02:12:20.200]
to defeat in the war on terror, but the specter of their own defeat.

[02:12:20.600 --> 02:12:23.280]
Mr. Lamont is but a passing embodiment of a fixed truth.

[02:12:23.580 --> 02:12:25.460]
Most Americans think the war in Iraq was a mistake

[02:12:25.460 --> 02:12:27.520]
and want some plan for a measured withdrawal.

[02:12:27.940 --> 02:12:29.960]
That truth would prevail even if Lamont had lost.

[02:12:30.600 --> 02:12:32.940]
A similar panic can be found among the wave of pundits

[02:12:32.940 --> 02:12:34.220]
some of them self-proclaimed liberals,

[02:12:34.540 --> 02:12:36.940]
who have to practically fret that Mr. Lamont's victory signals

[02:12:36.940 --> 02:12:39.660]
the hijacking of the Democratic Party by the far left,

[02:12:39.900 --> 02:12:41.560]
here represented by virulent bloggers,

[02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:45.140]
and a prospective replay of its electoral apocalypse of 1972.

[02:12:45.740 --> 02:12:47.040]
Whatever their political affiliation,

[02:12:47.200 --> 02:12:49.520]
almost all of these commentators suffer from the same syndrome,

[02:12:49.880 --> 02:12:51.860]
they supported the Iraq War under a few exceptions

[02:12:51.860 --> 02:12:53.740]
mainly at the Wall Street Journal and the Wiggly Standard,

[02:12:54.140 --> 02:12:55.420]
are now embarrassed that they did.

[02:12:56.020 --> 02:12:57.740]
Desperate to assert their moral superiority

[02:12:57.740 --> 02:13:00.000]
after misjudging a major issue of our time,

[02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:02.720]
they lockedily declared that anyone who shares Mr. Lamont's

[02:13:02.720 --> 02:13:05.220]
pronounced opposition to the Iraq War is not really serious

[02:13:05.220 --> 02:13:08.120]
about the war against the Gihadists who attacked us on 9-11.

[02:13:08.620 --> 02:13:10.920]
That's just another version of the Chinese Libra Mineragumin

[02:13:10.920 --> 02:13:11.220]
and its hogwash.

[02:13:12.100 --> 02:13:14.600]
Most of the 60% of Americans who oppose the war in Iraq

[02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:18.120]
also want to win the war against Al-Qaeda and its metastasizing allies.

[02:13:18.540 --> 02:13:20.920]
That's one major reason they don't want America bogged down in Iraq.

[02:13:21.520 --> 02:13:23.760]
Mr. Lamont's public statements put him in that camp as well,

[02:13:23.860 --> 02:13:25.060]
which is why those smirring him,

[02:13:25.400 --> 02:13:27.800]
reserved to the cheap trick of setting his leftist great uncle,

[02:13:28.140 --> 02:13:29.500]
the socialist Coralist Lamont,

[02:13:29.720 --> 02:13:31.900]
were fairly in a mix in it as far as the Republican who served

[02:13:31.900 --> 02:13:32.220]
in the next administration.

[02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:34.740]
Mr. Libra Miner, everybody partisan,

[02:13:34.740 --> 02:13:37.900]
has accused Mr. Lamont of being both a clasped Republican and a radical.

[02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:40.960]
These commentators are no more adept at reading the long-term

[02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:43.540]
implications of the Connecticut primary than the worst seeing-through

[02:13:43.540 --> 02:13:46.620]
blatant White House propaganda about Sodom's mushroom clouds.

[02:13:47.220 --> 02:13:49.580]
Their generalizations about the blogosphere are overheated,

[02:13:49.860 --> 02:13:52.600]
the shrewless left-wing voices on the Internet are no more representative

[02:13:52.600 --> 02:13:54.060]
of the whole than those of the far right.

[02:13:54.500 --> 02:13:56.140]
This country remains a country of the center,

[02:13:56.480 --> 02:13:58.280]
and opposition to the war in Iraq is now the center,

[02:13:58.320 --> 02:13:59.960]
and if you listen to Chuck Hagel and George Will,

[02:14:00.460 --> 02:14:02.420]
among other neo-conservatives, even the center right.

[02:14:02.420 --> 02:14:05.440]
As the election campaign quickens genuine nightmares,

[02:14:05.620 --> 02:14:09.020]
may well you strip the last gasps of robin fear-based politics,

[02:14:09.340 --> 02:14:12.060]
it's hard to ignore the tragic reality that American troops

[02:14:12.060 --> 02:14:15.340]
are caught on the crossfire of a sectarian bloodbath escalating every day,

[02:14:15.720 --> 02:14:18.300]
that botched American policy as strength in Iran and Hezbollah

[02:14:18.300 --> 02:14:21.020]
and undermined Israel, and that the Department of Homeland Security

[02:14:21.020 --> 02:14:22.780]
is ill-equipped not of prevent explosives,

[02:14:23.220 --> 02:14:25.560]
liquid or otherwise, and cargo as it was in 9-11.

[02:14:26.020 --> 02:14:29.100]
For those who've resided over this debacle and must face the voters in November,

[02:14:29.380 --> 02:14:32.280]
this is far scarier stuff than a full terrorist cell,

[02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:34.760]
nasty bloggers and Edelamont combined.

[02:14:35.120 --> 02:14:37.380]
This is Neil Rogers.

[02:14:38.220 --> 02:14:41.340]
This is 5.16.2.8.

[02:14:44.200 --> 02:14:48.600]
6.2006, that would be an important date to determine whether or not

[02:14:48.600 --> 02:14:51.400]
the war has been picked up by the state of Colorado.

[02:14:51.880 --> 02:14:52.660]
Thank you very much.

[02:14:52.820 --> 02:14:53.520]
Thank you for the feedback.

[02:14:53.960 --> 02:14:56.420]
There's the expedition here, Ejon Markar.

[02:14:56.880 --> 02:14:57.380]
Aren't you excited?

[02:14:57.880 --> 02:14:58.600]
Oh, yeah, I'm excited.

[02:14:58.860 --> 02:15:01.340]
He's been ordered extra-rated to Boulder.

[02:15:02.200 --> 02:15:04.080]
And what they're going to do is drop a huge border,

[02:15:04.700 --> 02:15:06.180]
and write on his pear-shaped ass.

[02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:09.700]
And there he goes, he's got a suit on, looking really snug.

[02:15:09.780 --> 02:15:10.780]
He's got a pear-shaped ass.

[02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:12.680]
We got out, and it's got the route.

[02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:16.200]
And when I'm up in Belkettika, slapping all the women with pinks and lips around the pole,

[02:15:16.440 --> 02:15:18.160]
I listen to the Neil Rogers one to two hours.

[02:15:18.720 --> 02:15:20.620]
Yeah, I mean, I listen to the Neil Rogers,

[02:15:20.800 --> 02:15:22.180]
I earned balance one to two hours.

[02:15:22.180 --> 02:15:47.540]
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well

[02:44:24.560 --> 02:44:31.440]
Now the time to put the barrel of a certain part of you

[02:44:31.980 --> 02:44:33.200]
Have it in there, boy!

[02:44:33.440 --> 02:44:40.020]
Show this oil barrel right where the sun don't shine

[02:44:40.020 --> 02:44:48.120]
Got us over a barrel, but we got a new thing in mind

[02:44:49.160 --> 02:44:51.940]
We'll fill our own barrels

[02:44:52.940 --> 02:44:56.420]
With what we grow on our land

[02:44:57.020 --> 02:44:59.980]
And we don't need your barrels

[02:44:59.980 --> 02:45:04.260]
You can all go pound sand

[02:45:04.260 --> 02:45:09.540]
Reckon 145, only 15 away from Curtis Stevenson and very important sports craft

[02:45:09.540 --> 02:45:14.340]
Iran rejected a deal on its Iranian Minerate Program back by the U.S. and other global powers today

[02:45:14.340 --> 02:45:15.820]
But its rejection was not outright

[02:45:15.820 --> 02:45:20.440]
In spite of the rejection Iran has apparently offered a new formula to resolve the issue through negotiations

[02:45:20.440 --> 02:45:26.600]
According to Ali Al Alam, the Iranian TV Channel Al Alam, they're on the land

[02:45:26.600 --> 02:45:32.140]
And meanwhile, an Iranian news agency's report of the nation's supreme leader has lashed out

[02:45:32.140 --> 02:45:36.300]
At U.S. President George W. Bush threatening to smash the arrogant powers

[02:45:36.300 --> 02:45:39.340]
If huge powers become involved in the current nuclear standout

[02:45:39.340 --> 02:45:42.220]
You got to love the foreign policy of this bunch, don't you?

[02:45:42.320 --> 02:45:43.420]
Sure, what's the name?

[02:45:44.260 --> 02:45:48.980]
Farce news agency closely affiliated with the Iranian Judiciary has quoted Ayatollah Khameini

[02:45:48.980 --> 02:45:54.520]
Not to be confused with Ayatollah Khomeini, who croaked an early fall out of the plane when he were transporting his casket

[02:45:54.520 --> 02:45:54.920]
Remember that?

[02:45:55.300 --> 02:45:55.420]
Yeah

[02:45:55.420 --> 02:45:57.720]
And actually the casket did fall out in the body

[02:45:58.420 --> 02:45:59.920]
He's rolling down the runway

[02:46:00.960 --> 02:46:05.240]
But Ayatollah Khameini is called on muslim leaders to join together to paralyze the U.S.

[02:46:05.780 --> 02:46:12.540]
This person Bush speaks as if he were the master and owner of Lebanon, Palestine, Iraq, Syria, Iran and other Muslim states

[02:46:12.540 --> 02:46:18.160]
But if the huge power of nations come to the scene as it happened in Lebanon, it will smash the arrogant powers so badly

[02:46:18.160 --> 02:46:22.100]
That the enemies of Islam will no longer be able to continue with their rude and arrogant behavior

[02:46:22.100 --> 02:46:25.460]
Said Ayatollah Khameini while addressing a public meeting on Tuesday

[02:46:25.460 --> 02:46:29.400]
Also attended by the heads of the three branches of government, the Expeediancy Council chairman

[02:46:29.400 --> 02:46:32.060]
The state and military officials and a partridge in a pair of three

[02:46:32.060 --> 02:46:34.300]
And by the way, most of the food was trief

[02:46:34.300 --> 02:46:40.340]
He said that the world-hedramatic powers had pinned much hope into former dictator of Iran, meaning the Shah

[02:46:40.780 --> 02:46:46.860]
And he reminded him, but Imam Khomeini provided a huge service for this nation and brought Iranians to the scene

[02:46:46.860 --> 02:46:48.200]
A bunch of Getskis

[02:46:48.200 --> 02:46:52.620]
If the same pattern of vigilance takes place in all these Islamic states and muslim nations come to the scene

[02:46:52.620 --> 02:46:56.320]
The U.S. and other arrogant powers of the world will be paralyzed in the face of the huge power of nations

[02:46:56.320 --> 02:47:00.820]
Remember what I told you about most of the decade about the Shah of Iran, about all these and the sovakh

[02:47:00.820 --> 02:47:02.520]
They used to pull out people's fingernails

[02:47:02.520 --> 02:47:06.500]
The worst torturers and butchers even maybe worse than the Tantan Makoot

[02:47:07.360 --> 02:47:08.440]
You know that old koot?

[02:47:08.440 --> 02:47:10.180]
Yeah, I know it. Oh, she's on again

[02:47:10.180 --> 02:47:16.340]
And whichever it is, all the way from the county jail, we're told that it's about a half hour drive

[02:47:16.760 --> 02:47:20.500]
So we would probably be able to get some aerial shots of that vehicle that he brings

[02:47:20.500 --> 02:47:26.260]
And the ability of being transported from there he would be taken to Los Angeles, between the airport

[02:47:26.260 --> 02:47:31.060]
You wonder why the public's minded like I was talking about before, why most people are like, like that in America?

[02:47:31.420 --> 02:47:32.320]
Like that?

[02:47:32.980 --> 02:47:36.720]
And of course the brits they got Richard Quest, they put on CNN International in the new now

[02:47:36.720 --> 02:47:39.100]
Or just to show you how silly they are with his donkey teeth

[02:47:39.100 --> 02:47:43.540]
That's why it turned over to MSNBC, I will not watch Richard Quest, under any circumstances

[02:47:44.280 --> 02:47:49.140]
If you thought the sight of New Orleans flooded to the eaves, its people trapped in antics are cowering on rooftops

[02:47:49.140 --> 02:47:52.380]
So as the nightmare heard, I better reach over and shut this up. Shut off that monitor

[02:47:53.320 --> 02:47:54.840]
Why, I should have done it a long time ago

[02:47:54.840 --> 02:47:58.060]
And if we have any reasonable calls today, maybe one or two, huh?

[02:47:58.280 --> 02:47:59.820]
You know, I don't remember the sovakhs

[02:47:59.820 --> 02:48:03.520]
We call any that we're like, you know, we couldn't live without, I don't know

[02:48:03.520 --> 02:48:06.860]
Although I do like that one segment there where we had like the whole Russian and all of a sudden

[02:48:06.860 --> 02:48:09.560]
But yeah, a flick of the finger man, they all like vanished

[02:48:10.120 --> 02:48:11.600]
But I want you to forget it

[02:48:11.600 --> 02:48:13.540]
And of course their motto being, I have no life

[02:48:13.540 --> 02:48:18.560]
If you thought the sight of New Orleans flooded to the eaves, its people trapped in antics are cowering on rooftops

[02:48:18.560 --> 02:48:20.860]
Was the nightmare hurricane scenario, think again

[02:48:20.860 --> 02:48:24.520]
And guess who is passing this information along to us?

[02:48:24.980 --> 02:48:29.020]
I give you a clue, Hurricane Center, inarticulate, old, funny, dutty

[02:48:29.020 --> 02:48:30.680]
Max Mayfield, oh that one

[02:48:30.680 --> 02:48:32.440]
I wonder if he's kind of Curtis Mayfield

[02:48:33.020 --> 02:48:38.460]
You're right there, the National Hurricane Center says there's plenty of potential for a storm worse than Hurricane Katrina

[02:48:38.460 --> 02:48:44.060]
Which killed 1339 people on the West Coast and cost some $80 billion in damaged landstores

[02:48:44.060 --> 02:48:46.380]
And most of the people, by the way, are not back in their homes

[02:48:46.380 --> 02:48:49.460]
And they're still wandering around like a bunch of uh, refuies

[02:48:51.380 --> 02:48:53.120]
People, oh, Curtis Mayfield, alright

[02:48:53.120 --> 02:48:58.540]
People think we have seen the worst we have as Mayfield toward voters and interview with the fortress like Hurricane Center

[02:48:58.540 --> 02:48:59.420]
In Miami

[02:49:00.160 --> 02:49:05.400]
I think the day is coming, you said I think eventually we're going to have a very powerful hurricane in a major metropolitan area

[02:49:05.400 --> 02:49:10.040]
Worse than what we saw in Katrina and it's going to be a mega disaster with lots of lost lives

[02:49:10.040 --> 02:49:12.440]
Not if we can put Brownie Brown back in charge again

[02:49:12.440 --> 02:49:15.080]
If we can get him off those Arabian horses' asses

[02:49:15.080 --> 02:49:18.920]
I don't know whether that's going to be this year or five years from now or a hundred years from now

[02:49:18.920 --> 02:49:24.180]
But as long as we continue to develop the coastline like we are, we're setting up for disaster said old Max

[02:49:24.180 --> 02:49:25.200]
Mad Max

[02:49:25.760 --> 02:49:30.480]
If I remember back during Katrina probably the most important thing that anybody said to Max

[02:49:30.480 --> 02:49:31.660]
Don't stop us at Max

[02:49:32.240 --> 02:49:36.080]
Looking back nearly a year to the costliest natural disaster in US history

[02:49:36.080 --> 02:49:38.320]
And the third worst hurricane in terms of American lives lost

[02:49:38.320 --> 02:49:41.340]
Mayfield said Katrina itself could have been a greater disaster

[02:49:41.340 --> 02:49:43.760]
More than two days before it struck the Gulf Coast

[02:49:43.760 --> 02:49:46.600]
It had printed the Hurricane Center for the future track accurately

[02:49:46.600 --> 02:49:51.420]
And warned it could become a powerful cat-four on the Safar Simpson scale of hurricane intensity

[02:49:51.420 --> 02:49:56.180]
New Orleans was squarely in the danger zone and emergency managers and residents had plenty of time to prepare

[02:49:56.180 --> 02:50:01.600]
One of my greatest fears is having people go to bed at night prepared for a cat-one and waking up to a Katrina Andrew

[02:50:01.600 --> 02:50:03.680]
He said, one of these days it's going to happen

[02:50:04.320 --> 02:50:08.940]
The worst case to a hurricane scenario may feel has many in mind a stronger hurricane closer to New Orleans

[02:50:08.940 --> 02:50:11.600]
A direct hit in the vulnerable Galveston Houston area

[02:50:11.600 --> 02:50:13.720]
I can just hear Glenn Campbell singing out, can't you?

[02:50:13.980 --> 02:50:15.140]
Hey Glenn, what's up?

[02:50:15.560 --> 02:50:19.140]
The fragile fluid of keys are heavily populated by me for a lot of deals

[02:50:19.140 --> 02:50:19.620]
Oh my God!

[02:50:19.940 --> 02:50:26.500]
Or how about a major hurricane raising up the East Coast of New York, New Jersey area, with its millions of people and billions of dollars of pricey real estate?

[02:50:27.080 --> 02:50:33.040]
One of the highest dorm surges possible anywhere in the country is where Long Island Juts out in re-Write angles to be Jersey Coast

[02:50:33.040 --> 02:50:36.100]
They can get 25 to 30 feet of storm surge

[02:50:36.100 --> 02:50:37.080]
About 30 men!

[02:50:37.140 --> 02:50:39.140]
Even going up the Hudson River Mayfield center

[02:50:45.020 --> 02:50:48.940]
The subways are going to flood some people might think how to go into the subways and I'll be safe

[02:50:48.940 --> 02:50:50.880]
No, they're going to flood if this happens, he said

[02:50:50.880 --> 02:50:57.120]
Mayfield is silver here at 34-year veteran who just turned 110 of the hurricane center who became its public face in 2000

[02:50:57.120 --> 02:50:59.660]
Is a tireless campaign if we're hurricane preparation

[02:50:59.660 --> 02:51:04.680]
If he's the public face of the hurricane center, does that make John Carcay, whatever his name is?

[02:51:04.900 --> 02:51:06.100]
Does that make him the public ass?

[02:51:06.380 --> 02:51:07.580]
The public peer test?

[02:51:08.300 --> 02:51:09.800]
I am embarrassed, man.

[02:51:10.300 --> 02:51:11.920]
Oh, it's starting to be embarrassing things.

[02:51:12.660 --> 02:51:15.000]
I'm sure you discussed this at length Monday, not.

[02:51:15.540 --> 02:51:20.740]
From a federal judge in Miami Monday dismissed the lead terror count against Jose Padilla, who used to be Jose Padilla,

[02:51:21.100 --> 02:51:27.320]
the U.S. citizen once identified as a dirty bomb suspect and detained his enemy combatant, you dirty rat, with your dirty bomb.

[02:51:27.800 --> 02:51:28.360]
And they like that.

[02:51:28.740 --> 02:51:29.620]
I had not heard that.

[02:51:30.220 --> 02:51:37.060]
U.S. District Judge Marsha Cook said in a written opinion that the charge can spurously demurder kidnapped and mean persons in a foreign country.

[02:51:37.060 --> 02:51:40.740]
Duplicated other counts in federal grand jury and that would hand it down last year.

[02:51:41.160 --> 02:51:45.860]
An indictment is multiplicity when it charges a single offense multiple times in separate counts, you wrote,

[02:51:46.300 --> 02:51:51.300]
as charged she added the indictment exposes Padilla and is co-defendants to multiple punishments for a single crime.

[02:51:51.780 --> 02:51:57.460]
The indictment cooks as alleges and one and only one conspiracy in some of the facts are realigned each of the consecutive counts.

[02:51:58.100 --> 02:52:03.120]
The two remaining counts are conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists and providing material support to terrorists.

[02:52:03.400 --> 02:52:05.900]
He's treated not guilty of the indictment trial schedule for the next year.

[02:52:06.440 --> 02:52:07.980]
Poor Jose Padilla Padilla.

[02:52:08.520 --> 02:52:11.480]
I mean, when you got a guy you can't even, you don't even know what his name is.

[02:52:11.720 --> 02:52:13.200]
And there is a kettle coffee again.

[02:52:13.300 --> 02:52:15.200]
They were the scarlet of mime in the background.

[02:52:15.380 --> 02:52:22.380]
Tendle, let me start with you because one of the things that the government has caught on that court room is outside by lawyers who spoke in his their concern about

[02:52:22.380 --> 02:52:24.080]
who's tanting a juryful.

[02:52:24.240 --> 02:52:29.380]
We don't know who his lawyer is going to be in the scandal when he gets back to Colorado.

[02:52:29.640 --> 02:52:31.080]
But how worried are you?

[02:52:31.160 --> 02:52:31.500]
How's he doing?

[02:52:31.500 --> 02:52:31.960]
How's he doing?

[02:52:31.960 --> 02:52:37.560]
Tanting the juryful or being able to control the way the picture of John Markhart gets out to the public?

[02:52:37.880 --> 02:52:39.780]
Well, it's a huge issue and immediate concern.

[02:52:40.020 --> 02:52:42.820]
And one of the first things the lawyer is going to do is, is, isn't he?

[02:52:42.840 --> 02:52:43.840]
Look like Bella LaGosia.

[02:52:43.960 --> 02:52:45.640]
Look, I'm strange lighting on him.

[02:52:45.760 --> 02:52:50.880]
Like they want to make him look like he's in, you know what they musin in park where they have those bizarre mirrors where you're looking in this place.

[02:52:51.100 --> 02:52:51.860]
Yeah, it's all under the front house.

[02:52:52.680 --> 02:52:53.640]
He's in the front house.

[02:52:53.780 --> 02:52:53.780]

[02:52:53.800 --> 02:52:54.460]
He's in the back house.

[02:52:54.560 --> 02:52:54.880]
He's in the back house.

[02:52:55.140 --> 02:52:56.480]
He's coming into place.

[02:52:56.620 --> 02:52:58.420]
That's like having a couple of coffee in the front house.

[02:52:59.560 --> 02:53:00.780]
Okay, well, you know something?

[02:53:00.980 --> 02:53:04.140]
I think we accomplished miracles here today, and especially they found out about...

[02:53:04.140 --> 02:53:04.360]
No!

[02:53:04.640 --> 02:53:05.380]
No, not about that.

[02:53:05.440 --> 02:53:05.620]
No!

[02:53:05.740 --> 02:53:06.940]
...or having that book coming out.

[02:53:07.040 --> 02:53:08.420]
Aren't you going to be reading that from the cover of the cover?

[02:53:08.680 --> 02:53:10.600]
Well, I was going to hope you'd read it to me.

[02:53:11.280 --> 02:53:13.340]
No, I'm not going to be reading on the ear.

[02:53:13.540 --> 02:53:16.600]
In fact, one of the most important things in her book is going to be...

[02:53:16.600 --> 02:53:16.940]
Hi!

[02:53:17.720 --> 02:53:18.580]
This is Jim.

[02:53:19.360 --> 02:53:20.640]
Love your show, Neil.

[02:53:21.120 --> 02:53:21.820]
Love you.

[02:53:22.400 --> 02:53:23.120]
Love you.

[02:53:23.960 --> 02:53:25.300]
This is Neil Rogers.

[02:53:26.200 --> 02:53:29.640]
This is 516 QA Am.

[02:53:33.240 --> 02:53:34.420]
It's Dan Ho!

[02:53:34.800 --> 02:53:36.040]
It's Miami Town.

[02:53:36.580 --> 02:53:40.860]
It's the loser at 560 WQA Am.

[02:53:44.140 --> 02:53:46.600]
People all over the world are losing their damn money.

[02:53:46.840 --> 02:53:47.460]
That's it.

[02:53:47.680 --> 02:53:49.320]
I get knocked out of a low-man's grasp.

[02:53:49.540 --> 02:53:50.300]
Enemy bombers approaching.

[02:53:50.680 --> 02:53:51.820]
Flash dealers, open fire!

[02:53:52.640 --> 02:53:53.860]
We got veterans.

[02:53:54.860 --> 02:53:56.240]
We got bombers.

[02:53:56.520 --> 02:53:57.320]
Warning, warning.

[02:53:57.840 --> 02:54:01.320]
On trackers and martyrs.

[02:54:01.440 --> 02:54:02.320]
We got profits.

[02:54:03.240 --> 02:54:04.820]
High gas prices.

[02:54:05.100 --> 02:54:06.420]
They're going up by six steps.

[02:54:06.520 --> 02:54:08.900]
Infravis explosive devices.

[02:54:09.320 --> 02:54:14.820]
Enemy world just does not get what it's all for.

[02:54:15.360 --> 02:54:18.180]
Of course, you know, this is who's war.

[02:54:20.600 --> 02:54:22.880]
I love this war.

[02:54:22.880 --> 02:54:25.500]
There's trouble from roughness to fight with our fists.

[02:54:25.700 --> 02:54:26.240]
Go home!

[02:54:26.520 --> 02:54:27.000]
Alibur.

[02:54:27.220 --> 02:54:28.260]
Money, money, money.

[02:54:28.480 --> 02:54:29.560]
Reducing a fusion.

[02:54:29.980 --> 02:54:31.340]
Friar crazy or something.

[02:54:31.680 --> 02:54:33.420]
Way more fun than Vietnam.

[02:54:34.760 --> 02:54:35.640]
We got ours.

[02:54:36.380 --> 02:54:37.700]
We got voters.

[02:54:37.980 --> 02:54:39.340]
Do you think people will vote for me?

[02:54:39.500 --> 02:54:39.800]
Yes.

[02:54:40.020 --> 02:54:41.580]
We're still angry to notice.

[02:54:43.240 --> 02:54:48.300]
Everyone else will be dead and poor.

[02:54:48.300 --> 02:54:50.280]
Find your money to match us.

[02:54:50.420 --> 02:54:51.520]
We're all gonna die.

[02:54:54.180 --> 02:54:56.500]
I love this war.

[02:55:01.220 --> 02:55:02.260]
Bye bye bye!
