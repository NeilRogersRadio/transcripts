[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600]
Yes, I have my server enabled my system to stabilize to.

[00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.240]
I am online to convey my thoughts and go loving with you.

[00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.200]
I must ensure first and foremost to upgrade my DSL,

[00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.340]
so that I can speedily download as I stand for quarter as well.

[00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.100]
A bloggery blog, one of the blog HTTP, hey look at me.

[00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.180]
Here is an interesting blog I'm composing.

[00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.880]
A Xbox 360 PS3 will soon be mine or mine.

[00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.420]
I've been standing here waiting online since Windows 95.

[00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.560]
The guy owned one smelling t-shirt, a vintage one of Aquaman.

[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.800]
And I have my clothes on all of my socks because I am a literally fat man.

[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.340]
I'll be an I'm a slubbering blubber who is badly in need of a tan.

[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.980]
I can type with my Fats to be finished with only one hand.

[00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.140]
Okay, 10 a 1 at 5.60 WQM, happy Thursday to you.

[00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.520]
November 30th, and what is it?

[00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.500]
About 30 man.

[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.260]
Wow, it is the last day in November already.

[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.260]
In March of December 1, aren't you excited about that?

[00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.860]
Of course not.

[00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.280]
No.

[00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.840]
Nothing excites you anymore because you're old and you basically gave up.

[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.340]
That's right.

[00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.360]
Long time ago.

[00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.680]
Sure.

[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.280]
That's about nine years ago.

[00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.220]
Or so.

[00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.200]
At any rate, Miguel is evil in the Antichrist,

[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.240]
and I'm going to curse him out for four hours today.

[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.580]
You know that whole mind-space thing?

[00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.680]
Why did you do that, Miguel?

[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.620]
Anyway.

[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.100]
What?

[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]
I'm too old.

[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.320]
You know, the star I had in my life is just fine waiting.

[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.320]
You need to be involved then.

[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.420]
I don't want to be involved.

[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.760]
I don't read the messages on there.

[00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.740]
I don't get involved with it.

[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.600]
I don't want to know from it.

[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:29.440]
And by the way, Jeff,

[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.560]
go sell some spots for the people you're working for.

[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.500]
Leave us alone already.

[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.780]
Will you?

[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.860]
You clown you tub.

[00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.960]
So yesterday we had the story about the kittens that got like

[00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.460]
whatever they had fried and twisted and yanked.

[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.580]
And then we had the story about the little baby in the microwave.

[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.160]
Well, Shamu, the killer whale.

[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.040]
Did you see this?

[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.160]
Yeah, I was just watching the report this morning.

[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.440]
Enjoy the trainer during a show at SeaWorld Adventure Park in San Diego

[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.420]
by grabbing his foot and pulling him underwater twice.

[00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.920]
It's about time the animal struck back like it only like the crock guy.

[00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.300]
That's right.

[00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.060]
Like crock.

[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.660]
Leave these poor freaking animals alone already.

[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.400]
We're not going to eat them.

[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.020]
Leave them alone.

[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.700]
That's right.

[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.660]
If they're not going to be really tasty and delicious and uh, uh,

[00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.260]
get it right away.

[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.740]
The 39-year-old man was hospitalized in good condition after Wednesday.

[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.240]
He shows that Mike Scar Putsi, a park official.

[00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.820]
Scar Putsi, who oversees neurological operations,

[00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.300]
they didn't know the extent of the trainer's injuries.

[00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.100]
We don't really care.

[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.340]
The park declared a release to trainers name saying some members of his family

[00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.200]
have yet to be notified.

[00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:23.700]
He's a way of a guy though.

[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.560]
Scar Putsi said the trainer had been working with animals for 16 years,

[00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.740]
including 12 spread at Shamu Stadium.

[00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.160]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.940]
Shamu Stadium.

[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.380]
What are you kidding me or what?

[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.600]
See, why can't we leave those animals alone in their native habitat

[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.980]
in the ocean where they belong and quit like, uh,

[00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.360]
oh yeah, put them in the circus, you know?

[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.720]
Right.

[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.980]
We got plenty of people to work for us that we had to put in the circus,

[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.100]
but who they would believe in.

[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.920]
Here's the poll result from yesterday when 1653 votes.

[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.120]
And by the way, since the calls came back, man,

[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.360]
we are just kicking big, pimply, smelly ass.

[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.060]
You wouldn't believe it.

[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.620]
You believe it?

[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.020]
No.

[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.780]
That's all right.

[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.800]
Guys who shave or remove their chest here generally are 1653 votes.

[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.580]
And the by far,

[00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.420]
gay wins hands down your pants, gay 520.

[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.360]
Straight guys don't shave their, uh, thing, their chest.

[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.900]
Right.

[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.360]
Mars is cystic, 222.

[00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.420]
The kind of guys that like to stand in the mirror all day and admire their, uh,

[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.400]
you know, smooth, shave and hot body,

[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.440]
even though they probably look like, uh, crap.

[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.540]
Easily manipulated by media imagery, 192.

[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.800]
Perfectly normal, 167.

[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.520]
That's what you guys both voted for, right?

[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:24.040]
Right.

[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.060]
Perfectly normal.

[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.620]
Right.

[00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.520]
In need of attention, number 13, that was while I voted.

[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.500]
They need attention.

[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.300]
I'm talking about like, uh, lobotomy.

[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.280]
Insticure 99, clean, 94.

[00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.800]
They got a clean machine line.

[00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.260]
Oh, and thank God I finally went down to my, uh,

[00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.140]
hot machine yesterday at Woodbuy and thank God for that bailed my ass out.

[00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.180]
I want a couple of bucks.

[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.700]
Not enough to change my life.

[00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.480]
I hate this pool 91.

[00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.360]
The rains 59.

[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.560]
Showoffs 55.

[00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.340]
They're sexy 27.

[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.880]
I wonder how many gay guys voted for that.

[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.860]
And young 14, only young guys.

[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.200]
Of course, why, what does young mean?

[00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.480]
And South Florida means under 100.

[00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:58.260]
They're young.

[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.560]
And full among.

[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.220]
Now the fool for today, which, uh, now is this one,

[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.360]
that the word this one come from.

[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:05.880]
Oh, this is, uh, because of rich raw.

[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.880]
Thanks Rick and all the, the Sunsettle discovered rich raw is retiring.

[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.380]
Here it is Thursday.

[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:11.760]
This happened two days ago.

[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.660]
The Harold was all over it like stink on Joyce.

[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.700]
And the Sunsettle just discovered it.

[00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.340]
For you people are so slow.

[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.080]
As Tom Jickel would say, you're so out of touch.

[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.800]
846 votes already under these pool.

[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.940]
There's a speaking of turkeys.

[00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:24.500]
There's the Pope.

[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.180]
He's in Turkey.

[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.100]
Wouldn't surprise me at all if they, uh,

[00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.100]
finish his ass off.

[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.700]
But nevertheless,

[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.440]
Rick Shaw is retiring.

[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:31.660]
When should Neil retire?

[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.500]
Retire!

[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:33.540]
That's the question.

[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.160]
846 votes.

[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.100]
Whenever he feels like it 409,

[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.860]
well, thank you so much.

[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:38.480]
That's what I voted.

[00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.880]
You know what?

[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.360]
That's what I'm going to do when I feel like it.

[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.580]
And what Rick Shaw told me that well-friend had told him,

[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:43.920]
you'll know when it's time, you know?

[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.400]
Oh, my package is showing up between 1030 and 2.

[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.600]
They're going to make another delivery attempt.

[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.440]
Which I didn't hear him knock on the door in the first place.

[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.820]
They must've come about, you know,

[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:51.880]
6 this morning or something.

[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.280]
How could I not have heard it?

[00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.940]
I don't know.

[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.920]
I mean, it's me.

[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.700]
I don't know.

[00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.460]
Maybe they came out of the shower.

[00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.280]
Well, how early delivery, uh,

[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.180]
Joyce started delivering.

[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.880]
Not before 9.

[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.360]
I don't know.

[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.040]
Well, whatever.

[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.620]
Who cares?

[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.460]
I'll let everybody feels like it 409.

[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.640]
Never 344.

[00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:08.680]
Yeah, it's possible.

[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.800]
Especially if Miguel keeps messing with my life.

[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.240]
Now, right now, return now.

[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.280]
Retire.

[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.340]
48, 5.6%.

[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.900]
How do you like that?

[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.740]
I'm 560, it's 5.6%.

[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.860]
Now, at one point, it was like up to 7%.

[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.560]
What time did you put this pool on your last night?

[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.420]
Like 630.

[00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.320]
Oh, 630.

[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.880]
A little bit late.

[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.520]
Oh, yeah.

[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.280]
That's what I thought.

[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.260]
It's not for our dinner.

[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.720]
Should we turn now 48?

[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.620]
In a few years.

[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.380]
And guess how many voted for it in a few years?

[00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.340]
About 30, man.

[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.560]
Okay, I'm retiring in 30 years.

[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.540]
I hate this pool only 8.

[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.060]
A 0.9.

[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:37.420]
Oh.

[00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.300]
Oh, there's some people can relate to that number.

[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.080]
It would be the first time they've seen that number.

[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.280]
And soon 7.

[00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.640]
And by the way, we are not sandbagging anybody show.

[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.080]
Contrary to the rumor that you're starting that somebody else is sand.

[00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.660]
Just like I told you, buddy, Joe, the other day on the phone.

[00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.160]
And I really mean this.

[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.480]
I hope that everybody on our station gets a 10-year-end man.

[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.840]
Sure.

[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.200]
I'll make our double bonus and make a lot of money

[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.000]
and everybody as well.

[00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.780]
I hope they get a hundred more.

[00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:58.200]
That's what I'm going to share.

[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.900]
Well, how about something and share?

[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.860]
Soon 8.

[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.260]
Soon.

[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.600]
Not right now, but soon.

[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:04.980]
In other words, you know.

[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:07.860]
Soon, get them off of there.

[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.160]
Those are probably your people, you know.

[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.980]
How many people want you to join today?

[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.380]
I'll go and wait for my package.

[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.740]
It's said they're coming sometime between 10, 30 and 2.

[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.760]
I'll be back right before 2 o'clock or after the package shows up.

[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.120]
How's that?

[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.700]
Sure.

[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.620]
Now that's a fair deal.

[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.500]
I'll go in my living room, watch a little TV.

[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.700]
Talk about it, shaving.

[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.160]
Some old, uh, what?

[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.100]
We'll talk all day about shaving.

[00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.560]
Oh, I don't want to hear about it.

[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.720]
And we'll play some hockey stuff.

[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:29.900]
The minute I thought it might be Oscar,

[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.380]
I minute thought leading to the one.

[00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:32.000]
Well, that's good.

[00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:32.920]
This is from a hundred.

[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.300]
More good audio on this one.

[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.920]
Washtown, Kinisco.

[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.040]
Never Kinisco.

[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.500]
Of course, you know, it's before you were born.

[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:39.280]
I saw the documentary.

[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:40.080]
Did you?

[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.860]
It's kind of like those Edison cylinders.

[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.380]
Right.

[00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.840]
In fact, they started on that biography.

[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.500]
His, yeah, that was pretty interesting for an old far like me.

[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.360]
He started with a tinfoil.

[00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:52.100]
That's correct.

[00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:53.680]
On a hand crank.

[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.080]
I had a little laugh.

[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.220]
It was really neat.

[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.100]
He had the tinfoil.

[00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.920]
Then he went to Waxy,

[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.080]
had too much Waxy build up though.

[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.640]
And the needle was a stick is a pencil.

[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.220]
I'm not talking about the tip of a pencil.

[00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.840]
I'm talking about the width of a pencil.

[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:07.680]
Very good.

[00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:08.640]
Do you ever see those old needles?

[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.040]
And of course, you've seen your Soviet RPM needles, haven't you?

[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.280]
My Byron D. Harlan.

[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:12.640]
That's the whole thing.

[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.180]
Ha ha ha ha.

[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.180]
Here's the Edison cylinder repellent.

[00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:16.700]
Oh, right.

[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.440]
Let's play this all day today.

[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:19.440]
I'm in the mood to do it.

[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.180]
Here's our new format,

[00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.260]
not our brick shot's retirement.

[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.100]
Let's hear it.

[00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.260]
All so we're doing recording.

[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:30.760]
It's all day.

[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.180]
And you might even play Mani by El Jorzen.

[00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:35.760]
We don't want to piss those, whoever they want.

[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:36.500]
I'm coming right up.

[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.480]
We'll do a segue.

[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:38.480]
You got Mani?

[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.360]
Okay, segue to Mani by El Jorzen.

[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.520]
I'm trying to remember if that was on Capitol Records.

[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.100]
It was on the Zolt 78s.

[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.420]
Here we go.

[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.000]
Put on that black face now.

[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:49.920]
My trick is to be proud.

[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.360]
I got what he knows, but it'll call you next.

[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:53.720]
Everything seems lovely.

[00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.060]
When you can talk about legislation.

[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.280]
Dark rule rules.

[00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.120]
It's your heart out, Ricky Tickie.

[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.600]
I mean, the same Vainel praio song we were listening to this morning.

[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.320]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.100]
Right, favor sign.

[00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:06.940]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.460]
No, you know what I'm saying?

[00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:08.640]
No, you know what I'm saying?

[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.060]
Once you might.

[00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:12.840]
Yeah, that'll be it.

[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.400]
Then I can retire.

[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.920]
Yes, what you say.

[00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:17.520]
Retire.

[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.640]
I understand he was a sensation.

[00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.840]
And you know, in your asking why?

[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:24.980]
That's the Abbey's story.

[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.340]
How come Al Jorzen?

[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:26.920]
Why?

[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.080]
I don't know.

[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.520]
I can only imagine everything else sounded worse.

[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:31.420]
That's right.

[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:32.180]
Wow.

[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:33.200]
I never hear Rudy Valley.

[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:33.900]
He was a beacon.

[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.500]
So all right, that's enough of that already.

[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.140]
I can hear the scratches in the record.

[00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.520]
You're playing it off a thing.

[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:40.360]
Give me a headache.

[00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.220]
Man, well try head on.

[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.160]
The makers of head on.

[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.100]
That'll do it.

[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.160]
Wow, what a segue.

[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.500]
We're cooking now.

[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:49.920]
I better leave for wood buying right now.

[00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:51.380]
Leave a message for the adliver guy.

[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.840]
Tell him what to do with my package.

[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:53.900]
Look at those phones.

[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:54.820]
They're smoking, maybe.

[00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:55.760]
Right off the agitco.

[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:56.680]
It's Thursday already.

[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.040]
It's the fourth day of bringing the calls back on the show.

[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.880]
It's been a major, major success.

[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.540]
A humongous, big fat booby hit.

[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.260]
As what's his name would say?

[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:06.420]
What was his name in that movie?

[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:07.540]
Frank Hackett.

[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.020]
OK.

[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:09.460]
Well, I was Robert Dubal.

[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.460]
It was Frank Hackett network.

[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.800]
That was way after Josh fell asleep in a movie.

[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.880]
So embarrassed and humiliated and degraded for it.

[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.840]
But it's just not your generation.

[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:18.860]
You know, it's not your thing.

[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.420]
It's like you said, anybody under 100

[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.180]
wouldn't listen to me reading stupid bedtime stories

[00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:23.740]
for four hours.

[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:24.200]
And you're right.

[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.540]
No, I like movies that, you know, entertainer.

[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.740]
I don't care when they were made.

[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:29.340]
Yeah.

[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.620]
Do you like movies with naked chicks?

[00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.280]
Well, Faye Dunway was naked there for,

[00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:33.860]
but of course we didn't see her and who to hold onto.

[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.880]
Anyway, she didn't know a bag.

[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:35.960]
But she was naked.

[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.400]
She was on top of Bill Holden there.

[00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:38.200]
She was holding it.

[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.180]
878 votes on the poll.

[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.660]
Well, once we get to 1,000, I'm going

[00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.600]
to go lay down on the floor and wait for that knock on the door.

[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.620]
Then I'll have my back up, fax machine mine.

[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:47.780]
Now, let's see.

[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.300]
She should return.

[00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:49.880]
Now, it's done at 5.5%.

[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.040]
If we can get that down to the vicinity of 5%,

[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.360]
I might stick around another couple of days.

[00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.240]
You never know, although I'm so depressed.

[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.740]
Oh, God, I'm so damn depressed.

[00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.980]
Don't ever, let me just, here's a suggestion to you.

[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:01.820]
I really mean this.

[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.720]
Don't get involved in like those classmates things.

[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.660]
And why do you already been involved in so of I?

[00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.740]
This kind of nostalgia living in a past.

[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:10.560]
I mean, it's kind of fun.

[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:11.860]
It's neat getting in touch with people

[00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:13.680]
that you went to school with or haven't seen in a long time.

[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.700]
Although if you haven't seen them in many, many years like me,

[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.160]
you don't really want to see them anymore.

[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.200]
Oh, my goodness.

[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.140]
Oh, oh, oh.

[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.060]
I told you about the pictures I got of my classmates

[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:21.680]
from high school.

[00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:22.080]
Yes.

[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.760]
Well, when the last time you saw somebody,

[00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.080]
they were 18 years old and they looked really, really good.

[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:26.260]
That's right.

[00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.740]
And now they're like your age, you're meaning me,

[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.600]
60 or whatever.

[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.380]
Oh, God, you look at it.

[00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:32.720]
Oh, geez, you look old.

[00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:34.480]
I wonder why.

[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.080]
Well, nobody wants to do that.

[00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.020]
Nobody wants to see that.

[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.900]
In addition to which, when you send people messages

[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.040]
and they don't respond, see with me,

[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.700]
I take it personal.

[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:43.940]
Even though I put on this good,

[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.480]
veneer, this good front on the ear,

[00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:46.280]
I take it first.

[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.580]
I don't get insulted by the show or anything that happens

[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:49.000]
on the show.

[00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:49.720]
I don't care about that.

[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:50.120]
It's crap.

[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:50.860]
Mm-hmm.

[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.700]
But personal, you know, in other words,

[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.140]
this is business and that's personal.

[00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:55.900]
I get to get a lot of slackers.

[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.800]
Like I check my, my space email,

[00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.100]
like once every two weeks or something.

[00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.080]
Okay, whatever you say.

[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:02.880]
Stuttering Gills is my girlfriend's name is Linda,

[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.560]
not Stuttering John, like you named her on Tuesday.

[00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.680]
By the way, can I wish you a happy birthday,

[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:08.400]
which is Friday?

[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.240]
Says, don't ever retire.

[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:11.320]
Neocard will resurrect.

[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.300]
Oh, yeah.

[00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:13.420]
Damn, God.

[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.500]
Stuttering Gills is going to be a little bit chronic,

[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:16.220]
if you ask me.

[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.580]
Stuttering John, Gill, whatever the hell's name is.

[00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:20.500]
Or maybe his name is What's That Guy They Got in the Morning?

[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.340]
That they sent out to do the Stuttering John,

[00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:24.820]
like interviews with these people?

[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:25.520]
Manning.

[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.400]
Oh, manning.

[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:26.900]
Yeah.

[00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:28.580]
He reminds me of him, reminds me of him,

[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:31.040]
reminds me of his best waltly from the Orion Ronshow.

[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.040]
He reminds me of Gobert.

[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.340]
And I say that with great regret.

[00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.020]
But don't be sandbagging their show now.

[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.340]
We wish them all the success,

[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.140]
especially with all those sports segments.

[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.600]
The biggest name, so best talent to do this is

[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.420]
Neil Rogers, sports radio five sixties.

[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.640]
You, a, man.

[00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.340]
Rogers, I, coming up tonight,

[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.800]
an inside of behind the true Hollywood celebrity music

[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.100]
biography profile story.

[00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:57.380]
He grew up in poverty and inspired the people

[00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.620]
to make it with his songs of peace and protest.

[00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:03.300]
If he knew that he would one day be the voice of disenfranchised,

[00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.300]
suburban white, frat boys, he would probably

[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.040]
soil himself.

[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.360]
He was Bob Marley.

[00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.620]
Bob Marley is the man.

[00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.240]
Rick Whiteman is a young white man.

[00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.280]
Whenever one of my college professors,

[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.740]
who I call the great oppressors,

[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.360]
make me write some term paper or something,

[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.940]
I just know how Bob Marley felt,

[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.440]
being in a crime-ridden slum all the time.

[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.720]
Get up, get up.

[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.040]
Get up for your ride.

[00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:37.480]
Yeah.

[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.900]
I don't know how Bob Marley does it.

[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:43.120]
Bob Caucasian is another young white man.

[00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:46.020]
I mean, how does this guy from the Jamaican ghetto

[00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.560]
know how angry it makes me when my parents

[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.120]
will let me have the escalate?

[00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.320]
Or how I'm filled with resentment

[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.640]
when I go over on my cell phone minutes?

[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.740]
Oh, Bob Marley.

[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.240]
Oh, Bob Marley does it.

[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.440]
Silly Bob.

[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:05.900]
Yeah.

[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.760]
And of course, there's the gunja.

[00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.580]
Yeah, haunt me that spreefman.

[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.900]
When I smoke the gunja, it is like I am back in these slums

[00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:17.080]
of Kingston, man.

[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.320]
Even though in my daily life,

[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.240]
I crossed a street to avoid black people, man.

[00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:24.020]
Jarlove.

[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:31.320]
Yeah.

[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.800]
See you down at the mall, my brother.

[00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:38.500]
Bob Marley, he became the voice of those who didn't have a voice.

[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:42.020]
Now he's the voice of those who in just wish would shut up.

[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:43.220]
It's a bit.

[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.140]
She was like shopping at a show business.

[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.240]
Tonight, on inside the bike.

[00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.500]
Maybe Bob Marley can go to a woodman with me next,

[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.240]
visiting help me find a good machine mine.

[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:51.740]
What do you think?

[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:52.940]
Could only help him.

[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.620]
10-18, I'll slap his body along.

[00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:56.280]
We'll see what we turn up.

[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.240]
906 votes on the poll already.

[00:13:58.380 --> 00:13:58.960]
I'd say one thing.

[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.100]
These are calls coming back or any indication.

[00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:03.340]
We have living and breathing people back on the show.

[00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:03.880]
You think that?

[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:04.180]
No.

[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.440]
5-6-7, look at the way that phone is, man.

[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:07.440]
Is it working or what?

[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:08.360]
Let me just check here.

[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:09.660]
Oh, yeah, it's working.

[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:10.880]
Lionel, one of those still not working.

[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:11.300]
You see that?

[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:12.280]
I do see that.

[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.000]
I just mentioned that in passing.

[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.160]
George, by the way, fixed the pot on the board

[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.340]
so we can actually turn it on and off

[00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:18.560]
as microphone at least to a point.

[00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:19.040]
Right.

[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.120]
Got ours a little bit.

[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.860]
And if any, diddled and whittled and pochkeyed and not worked.

[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.760]
Took it all apart because of engine interstamp

[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.440]
is unresponsive and our management is totally non-responsive

[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.380]
and they could care less of it,

[00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:30.460]
only because they didn't understand

[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:31.460]
how anything there works anyhow.

[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.440]
So it's just like a kind of potlock.

[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.120]
I don't see this phone smoking,

[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.660]
but once this delay builds up and after about 25 minutes,

[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.980]
you're going to see a tremendous explosion on that phone.

[00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:41.840]
You'll see it.

[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:42.760]
Well, not tremendous.

[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.160]
And I'm not answering Lionel 9.

[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.340]
That's Josh's line.

[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:47.040]
That's all yours.

[00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:48.160]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:48.800]
No.

[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:49.940]
I'm onto that one.

[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:50.760]
That's what I'm trying to say.

[00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:51.800]
I was giving it to you.

[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.380]
You want your very own phone line?

[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:54.860]
Yeah, but you have your own personal line.

[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:55.700]
I'll tell you that.

[00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:56.500]
It took me a while.

[00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.640]
I can let Miguel with my own MySpace page,

[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:00.200]
which up until the end of the day,

[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:02.080]
I never looked at anything on there.

[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:03.260]
I never read any of the crap.

[00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:05.140]
Although I did read some of the stuff yesterday

[00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:06.520]
from some schmuck on there who says,

[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.200]
I see you're taking calls again.

[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.600]
You were slaved to public opinion.

[00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:10.380]
Right.

[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.860]
Taking calls again because the show sucked is what happened

[00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:15.720]
is what I wasn't happy with it.

[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.800]
That's why I slaved to public opinion, my ass.

[00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:20.160]
All these, like I told you before,

[00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:21.520]
you have to be a masochist.

[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.780]
These people in the chat rooms

[00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:24.840]
and with their comment lines and all this crap.

[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:25.920]
Who the hell wants it?

[00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:27.720]
You know, it's like taking calls on a talk show.

[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:29.300]
WQAM, hello.

[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:30.880]
Be okay, George.

[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:31.960]
Not gay.

[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:32.720]
QA.

[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.160]
Okay, good.

[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:34.680]
WQAM, hello.

[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.020]
It's public opinion.

[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:37.320]
QAM.

[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.080]
Taking calls again because this show,

[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.060]
I don't know what's that.

[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:40.500]
Hello.

[00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:41.140]
Yeah.

[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:42.780]
That's calling the hell.

[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:43.920]
Why is it?

[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.460]
What is it, man?

[00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:49.920]
WQAM, hello.

[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:51.100]
Hey, Neil.

[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:51.980]
Yes, sir.

[00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.100]
Hey, you were asking out early to delivery service.

[00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:56.540]
What did you have for UPS?

[00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:57.400]
Yeah.

[00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:01.000]
I got a delivery at 6.31 more and they're paying off.

[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:01.560]
I don't know.

[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:03.580]
Was it come here in a wee hours of the morning

[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:05.380]
when I was sound asleep or maybe when I was in the shower,

[00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:05.660]
man?

[00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:08.300]
Yeah, maybe when you were taking a squat in the bathroom.

[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.160]
That could have been it too, although I would have heard that

[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.720]
and that would have been really a perplexing.

[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:12.880]
You know, I would have finished squatting.

[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.440]
Well, yesterday you mentioned on air about

[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:20.600]
Twilight Zone with some racing forms from the day before

[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.400]
or something like that.

[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.400]
Was the racing form, the guy got the next day's newspaper

[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.280]
had the race results from the day before, yeah.

[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.640]
So I saw that one that's like Jack Cogman

[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:31.260]
when he was like 10 years old.

[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:32.480]
I mean, before he could speak,

[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.660]
he was still punching his gut side

[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.720]
and he was still a chain-smoking, too, as a matter of fact.

[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.200]
But he had a nice day, Neil.

[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.120]
Okay, thank you.

[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:39.780]
I think he's right.

[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:40.580]
It was Jack Cogman.

[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.500]
It was either Twilight Zone or Outer Limits.

[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:43.160]
One of those.

[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.480]
Good show, which of course we don't have very many anymore,

[00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:47.480]
but that's what the old fart say like me

[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.340]
who were living in the past

[00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.880]
and want to go back to like drag net

[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.520]
and all that old can't be crap.

[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.760]
You know, fat detectives are running around,

[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.820]
waddling around, chasing those young hoodlums,

[00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:59.660]
you know, who were running like a bat on the hill

[00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.200]
and here's this fat detective, you know,

[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.540]
waddling around and is a licking cut in the middle by the way.

[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:06.760]
Which used to smash up all the time,

[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.120]
but he must have good insurance.

[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:10.260]
924 votes on a full rich,

[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:11.440]
shots announced his retirement.

[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.980]
The Sun Sentlet Justice covered that today

[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:13.960]
to much to my dismay.

[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:14.620]
They really suck.

[00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:16.120]
When should Neil retire?

[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:17.720]
924 votes.

[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:19.200]
Whenever he feels like it, 448,

[00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.040]
I thank you so much for your generosity

[00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:22.820]
because that's of course what I'll do.

[00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:24.320]
Never a 376.

[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:27.240]
Now a 51 5.5% right now.

[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.060]
Retire.

[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.360]
Oh, I love that.

[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.180]
In a few years, 32, a few.

[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:33.380]
Soon, nine and I hate this poll.

[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:33.860]
Only eight.

[00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.260]
0.8%.

[00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.040]
There's the pope with his white schmothy's,

[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.380]
dressing as a red shoes on.

[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:39.980]
All right, you go papa.

[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:41.580]
WDQA and hello.

[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:42.380]
Oh, come on.

[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.580]
I bet you all don't have to be doing red dogs and mother.

[00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:45.180]
Right?

[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:45.920]
I have.

[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:46.280]
I have.

[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.660]
Come on, move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move,

[00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:52.620]
move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move,

[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:53.260]
move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move.

[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:54.440]
Oh, I sure wish we had that.

[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.600]
Where the hell did that come from?

[00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:56.960]
I don't know, never heard that before.

[00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:57.920]
Yeah, I did.

[00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:58.720]
I love that.

[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:00.860]
WDQA and hello.

[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:02.240]
Out there.

[00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:04.300]
WDQA and Ola.

[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:05.600]
Hello, Neil.

[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:06.460]
Yes, sir.

[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:07.780]
Good afternoon.

[00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:08.980]
Good evening.

[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:14.220]
Actually, for me, I'm working for a club already after them.

[00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:15.420]
Like I said, good evening.

[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:16.240]
All right.

[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:17.880]
Good evening.

[00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:19.620]
I'm sorry.

[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:20.940]
I said, what do you got?

[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.700]
I got, I mean, the delectic one of yours,

[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:24.880]
it's sometimes pretty funny.

[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:25.980]
I know that you're a Jewish.

[00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:26.980]
I'm a half a Jewish, too.

[00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:28.760]
I have a Polish and a Russian.

[00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:32.940]
So I mean, just the definitions, what do you use sometimes,

[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:33.940]
you know, make me feel?

[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.440]
Did you ever heard from someone what it means,

[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.780]
the background or the hiking like a Chinese?

[00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.960]
And it's originally a Russian, a Russian and the Polish term?

[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:44.820]
Oh, man.

[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:46.440]
It was like that.

[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:47.960]
That was for Ad Junior, I think.

[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:48.340]
Wouldn't it?

[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.360]
I think that was for Ad Junior, June.

[00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:50.580]

[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.380]
Hey, let's take a look at that schedule for today.

[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:52.960]
It's a Thursday.

[00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.120]
Maybe in a course, you know what Thursday means on QM?

[00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:56.360]
A lot of spots.

[00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:58.600]
Oh, yeah, we got Curtis from Ad Dog or Tunel.

[00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.500]
I'm Ad Dog today or tomorrow.

[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.240]
I'm just wondering about that right now.

[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:02.620]
Curtis is fine, but the Mad Dog,

[00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:03.680]
he did one over do it.

[00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.320]
Then the power hour would hang solo from four to five,

[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:07.380]
hump or five to seven.

[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.800]
And then we got the Panther Crab, man, Panther preview

[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.160]
at seven o'clock, Panthers at the Ottawa Senators.

[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.020]
It was meant to play the Washington Senators in Ottawa,

[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.220]
at seven, thirty, followed by the Education Show,

[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.580]
who tonight starts at 10, as opposed to last night

[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:19.740]
when the schedule said 10, 30.

[00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:22.280]
We got Evan Cohen on Saturday and the weekend schedule.

[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:23.700]
Thanks you for setting it about that.

[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.340]
Then we got a show called Jock Strap's with Tom Alexander.

[00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:27.380]
What's that about?

[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.220]
Jock Strap's, that's an English show on his station.

[00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:30.780]
Jock?

[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:31.500]
Yes, it is.

[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:32.980]
It's actually been on for a little while.

[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:34.420]
And what is it?

[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:38.540]
If I'm not mistaken, he pays for the time.

[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:40.440]
Oh, another one of those deals.

[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.920]
Are there any punches pulled on that show?

[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:45.040]
I haven't, I can't say that I've listened.

[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:46.980]
Oh, I'm sure there's something pulled.

[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.320]
Maybe some strings get pulled to put them on the ear.

[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.880]
If he's paying for it, we'll put it on the ear.

[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.360]
Yeah, that's the way it works at QM.

[00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:53.500]
We just want the money, baby.

[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.540]
Crank that building up.

[00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:55.620]
We're under a lot of pressure.

[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:56.520]
Get that building up.

[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.380]
Make the beastlies a lot of money, sonny.

[00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:00.520]
933 votes on the pool.

[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.160]
And don't bother me with my space anymore.

[00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:06.260]
Although we do have 798 friends on my space.

[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:06.960]
Yeah.

[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:07.960]
And that exciting?

[00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:08.380]
No.

[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:09.200]
What else?

[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:09.980]
I just wish you would.

[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.200]
And he did that off on his own, too, by the way.

[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:12.540]
Yeah.

[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.980]
I don't, I just can't deal with it.

[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.520]
26 past what?

[00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:17.300]
You don't have to.

[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:18.300]
I'm not going to.

[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:19.680]
I just, I'm going to ignore it.

[00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:20.760]
I don't want to be involved.

[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:22.240]
You don't want to say, I don't want to be involved

[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.640]
in just one of those things.

[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.280]
26 after 10 at 5.60 WQM.

[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.580]
I've been taking nature B for like about three weeks now.

[00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:31.120]
And you can almost tell in my voice that it's really kicking in.

[00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:31.620]
Can you hear it?

[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:32.320]
I hear it.

[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:32.840]
I feel it.

[00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:33.600]
I can smell it.

[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.380]
This is about to be the best kept secret

[00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:36.420]
to living in the fast lane.

[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:37.960]
Forget all those pills and potions.

[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:39.760]
If you want to do something really good for yourself

[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.240]
and revitalize yourself, get on nature B.

[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:45.460]
Just two golden capsules a day and watch your life take off.

[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.460]
Not a drug or a stimulant, just pure organic food in the capsule.

[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.620]
All the way from clean, green, New Zealand,

[00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:52.400]
nature B is real food.

[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:53.500]
Pure is the driven snow.

[00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:55.320]
It's an A to Z of vitamins and minerals.

[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.680]
And nature B is really great for people on the run.

The biggest name, the best talent to the business,

[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.280]
Leo Rogers, 4th radio 560.

[00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:30.660]
You're in America.

[00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:33.620]
Aley Pop, little boy.

[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.600]
Christmas is right around the corner.

[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:39.780]
Now's the time to get your child the new educational joy that everyone's talking about.

[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:43.260]
New from Hasbin, the Ku Kluck Kramer doll.

[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:44.880]
The Ku Kluck Kramer doll?

[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:45.840]
How does it work?

[00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:48.340]
Sear child's eyes light up when he pulls the string.

[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.460]
And here's a cute Ketlin turkey in the likeness of Michael Richards.

[00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:54.780]
As he says one of five timeless lines about the holiday.

[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:57.920]
I can't speak a fast way, please.

[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.100]
Wow, this Ku Kluck Kramer doll is neat.

[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.000]
Mom, what?

[00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:05.600]
Now kids, being a turkey, I mean, I mean,

[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.680]
10 out of your own business and some of our reverse and trust in you, the four of you.

[00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:13.900]
Um, maybe we should put the Ku Kluck Kramer doll away now.

[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:15.340]
Come on, mom, let me play.

[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.420]
Being a turkey, being a turkey,

[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:20.280]
being a tree, so we're now kids a turkey.

[00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:22.160]
What kind of toy is this?

[00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:25.640]
Oh, mom, everyone at school wants a Ku Kluck Kramer doll.

[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.580]
The KKK doll is the best.

[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.300]
Honey, don't abbreviate Alex Lane later.

[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:32.020]
The Ku Kluck Kramer doll.

[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:36.100]
At now and get the Jerry Seinfeld talking pilgrim at No Extra Cuts.

[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.780]
What the deal with holiday food?

[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:40.080]
I don't know.

[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:42.740]
Oh, God.

[00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:46.340]
1031 and by the way, it's after 1031, you know what that means?

[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:47.980]
There could be a knock on that door.

[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:48.740]
Any minute now.

[00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.220]
And it could be my package that are load ups now.

[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:54.900]
I'll go out the package that I'm hoping for, but nevertheless, a landmark legal case

[00:22:54.900 --> 00:23:00.260]
on behalf of the Recording Industry Association of American Other Global Trade Organizations seeks

[00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:05.220]
to criminalize all internet file sharing of any kind as copyright infringement effectively

[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:06.440]
shutting down the worldwide web.

[00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:08.300]
And the argument is supported by the West Government.

[00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:13.060]
I don't want to say that the people at prison planted our little paranoid, but they're

[00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:15.040]
a little paranoid over there, you know, which is good.

[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:15.460]
It's fun.

[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:19.920]
Ray Beckerman, a Larry representing clients and cases against the RAAA recently took part

[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:25.600]
in a conference call organized by the defectedbydesign.org, an organization which opposes the RM technology,

[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:29.580]
content-restricting programs embedded in the software that blocks users access to music,

[00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:32.480]
movies, software, other forms of digital data.

[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:37.280]
Beckerman describes how internet users are randomly targeted by the RAA for simply having

[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:40.880]
a folder of music on their computer, kept in the dark about legal details, and intimidated

[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:44.600]
in paying thousands of dollars immediately or facing a federal freaking lawsuit.

[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:49.000]
The RAAA doesn't even attempt to prove copyright infringement with specific examples, dates

[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:49.380]
or times.

[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:53.260]
It simply coerces and threatens the victim until they relent into paying out huge settlement

[00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:53.680]
fees.

[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.540]
They have an investigator, pretend to be user of Paza or one of the other similar file

[00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:58.060]
sharing networks.

[00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:02.080]
He finds a shared file folder that has a goodly number of copyrighted songs in it.

[00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:06.080]
He has no idea whether those songs files were obtained legally, whether through paid

[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:10.120]
downloads or through making personal copies from one's own CD for backup purposes, or

[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:13.420]
whether anything illegal was ever done with those files, whether anyone ever copied one.

[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.600]
And what he does, he takes a screenshot of the shared files folder.

[00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:20.620]
He of course does not see the folders, he immediately sees the text in the metadata, and

[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.360]
decides this is a big shared file folder.

[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:24.120]
You following this?

[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:24.620]
Mm-hmm.

[00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:28.260]
Then through some secret process which he will not share with us and try to conceal from

[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:31.140]
the courts, he then associates it with their dynamic IP address.

[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:35.000]
And then after he has what he believes is the correct dynamic IP address, for the late

[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.940]
in time which he has made that screenshot, he then brings a proceeding to get the name

[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:41.120]
and address of the subscriber who paid for the internet access, which of course will tell

[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:41.540]
us nothing.

[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:44.580]
But once he gets that information, he then sues the person.

[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.320]
In one case, UMG versus Linda Ray, cleaner who's never used her own computer, but simply

[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.460]
dusted near one.

[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:54.280]
Dusted near one was sued as an online distributor and peer-to-peer file sharing.

[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:54.920]
How do you like that?

[00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:55.400]
Perth.

[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.660]
And if you're on one of those, uh, gay, then it's queer to queer file sharing.

[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:03.220]
Accusing the RAAA of conducting a random theorem by bringing lawsuits against defenseless

[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:07.680]
people, Beckham and Ward, that in one case in particular, electric versus barker, has

[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.780]
the potential to shut down the internet completely.

[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:11.140]
How do you like them bananas?

[00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:12.220]
Think want the banana.

[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:17.060]
RAAA's argument is that Ms. Barker, a poor nursing student who lives in housing project,

[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:21.400]
should be prosecuted on the basis that merely making files available on the internet is

[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.220]
in and of itself a copyright infringement.

[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:25.140]
Well, copyright my ass, how do you like that?

[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:26.780]
Alkaline, maniacs.

[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:30.700]
Beckham and Cousin can pay a shocking argument because if it were accepted, it would probably

[00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:31.840]
shut down the entire internet.

[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:36.100]
One of the UK's biggest technology news websites, the inquiry, also that they highlights

[00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:40.560]
the frightening development and article entitled RAAA wants the internet shut down.

[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:45.880]
The US government is also filed legal base supporting the RAAA's crap.

[00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:50.200]
Deep 16th in the interior, and it seems highly unlikely, and that it would probably derail

[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.860]
the world economy and put thousands of huge, transnational corporations out of business.

[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:57.500]
And outcome more likely to happen if this ruling is accepted, is that would further

[00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:00.880]
pave the way for government regulation and tracking of the internet, namely internet

[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:01.300]
2.

[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:06.340]
A completely controlled, surveilled and automatic, or autocratic, several police states,

[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:09.780]
sort of the Chinese model, whereby website owners have to obtain government permission

[00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:13.980]
to run a blog, be approved by a biometric thumb scan just to tune their computer on,

[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:16.740]
and immediately get their internet access shut off if they misbehave.

[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:17.760]
How do you like that?

[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.900]
If you work the word crap in a chat room, you're out.

[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.900]
You're done, and they're going to come knock it on the door.

[00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:26.920]
I don't hear any knock yet, but get that Al Jolson standing by, or the other stuff

[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.160]
was better, the Edison cylinder.

[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:28.740]
Oh, yeah.

[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:29.840]
That was choice.

[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.320]
This case is another attack on another attack on a force in government and the corporate

[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:37.960]
structure that seeks to suffocate the last outpost of true freedom of speech in the

[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:38.120]
past.

[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:43.500]
And it must be counted in all costs, writes Paul Joseph Watson on the very paranoid prison

[00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:44.300]
planter dot com.

[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:45.320]
I like that website.

[00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:47.000]
It's very paranoid and just right up my alley.

[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:48.040]
I like paranoid people.

[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:48.980]
You know what I mean?

[00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:50.480]
They're indicating anyway.

[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.540]
960 votes on the pool.

[00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:55.520]
Let's see if they think I'm still entertaining, or if it's time to hang up the microphone

[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:56.460]
or come going to hang it up.

[00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:57.540]
Rick Shaw's retiring.

[00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:59.320]
When should Neil retire as our pool question?

[00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:04.780]
Whenever he feels like it, 465 out of 960, almost half, whenever the hell he feels like

[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:04.980]
it.

[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:05.900]
He'll know when it's time.

[00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.340]
That's what Ralph Rednext said.

[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.400]
Never 390, never ever retire.

[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:13.960]
Sit there and keep bap bap bap bap like that forever until you collapse right there on

[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.900]
the floor until you croak right in the middle of a show.

[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:19.260]
Now 53, 5.5% say retire right now.

[00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:20.000]
Retire!

[00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:22.740]
Now 5.5% then what the hell would they do?

[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.240]
Well that's your crowd I forgot.

[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:24.800]
Oh yeah.

[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:25.300]
He's George Peaball.

[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:30.420]
In a few years, 34, I hate this pool 9 only a 0.9% and soon another 9.

[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:31.480]
Nine, say soon.

[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:32.780]
I bet your Robert Creeper is one of them.

[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:35.160]
He wants a really good sports show in there very soon.

[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.340]
Of course they don't have one yet.

[00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:37.420]
Now come up with somebody.

[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:40.580]
I'll get Joseph Yankee back in there and get the boogster back from the other joint.

[00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:44.280]
Joseph Yankee, the boogster and Chris Moron to get those nice one and two shares like

[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.120]
they used to have in midday.

[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:46.360]
Oh god was I.

[00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:47.420]
It's more comfortable.

[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:48.540]
It's safe when you're like that.

[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:49.420]
Yeah.

[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.660]
So like I said about that my space page.

[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:09.180]
As a little reputation Ben injured by appearing in the Borat movie.

[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:14.580]
Borat caused me to lose respect among my fraternity brothers and that ain't easy to do.

[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.640]
Were you deceived about the true nature of Borat's intention.

[00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:22.680]
He paid me money asked me to sign a release form and pointed a camera at me when I said

[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:26.080]
racist stuff how was I supposed to know I'd end up in his movie.

[00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:30.940]

chilly here tomorrow I'm gonna wish I was there well not really you think I wish that I was there

[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:20.800]

[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:24.700]
there it's already it's like 59 degrees here although it's very murky and cloudy and it's

[00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:47.880]
higher leopark racetrack once designated as historic by the city's historic preservation

[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:52.120]
board will no longer be considered as such after the sea council voted unanimously to take away

[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:55.760]
the historic billing the measure was approved to allow the demolition of the horse stable section

[00:32:55.760 --> 00:33:01.120]
of the 200 acre park mayor Julio Robina said hurricanes and turmites have damaged the more than

[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:05.340]
60-year-old wooden structures he argued that the structures were an ice or a need to be cleared

[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:09.020]
put it up bomb a grand day over there in a higher leopark that's a good idea in fact maybe

[00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:13.040]

[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:31.360]
westland you're looking for glory hole that's right anyway but residents on hand voice concerned

[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:35.420]
to take away the historic classification of the horse tables at the highly effacing palm avenue

[00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:40.060]
thirty second street would pave the way for development rather than preservation of the historic

[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:44.420]
park which once welcome presidents and foreign dignitaries for horse races well it's a long time

[00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:49.020]
ago talk about living in the past I hope this is not the first footboard to bring it in by the way

[00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:54.060]
speak of that highly a park yeah remember that campaign I think you were sure working that

[00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:57.940]
poem when called or was running opposite highly and they were like trying to stay in business highly

[00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:03.500]
etc and I took their side of course because I don't know why and uh Vilcaldor and I were out there

[00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:06.980]
at highly and we're trying to get people to come there in our audience I'll never forget one day

[00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:10.440]
I go I don't want to go into it it brings me right back to where I was before you know I'm just

[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:14.820]
not going to do that no more some old fag getting all emotional about some you know young straight guy

[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:19.860]
you just can't do that anymore it's a bad mistake that some of us make over an over an over again

[00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:24.160]
and get all emotional there were some really hot young guy there at highly and I even even to this

[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:27.640]
day do how many years ago it's about a hundred years ago I still remember right now I have a

[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:32.640]
retention in my mind for a pretty face like you wouldn't believe and I'm sure you do too yeah I'm

[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:36.980]
just not the same faces that's right I hope this isn't the first foot forward to bring in big

[00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:40.600]
developers to that property resident my mille Herrera set up the Tuesday night meeting

[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:44.760]
highly a park racetrack owned by the anxious the marginal john brunetti has experienced

[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:49.180]
defevilies after losing its state license so his horse races the racetrack has noted a full season

[00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:54.940]
since may of 2001 causing the practical vacant and beyond kinton appearance in the past robaena

[00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:59.020]
has listed the park as a possibility for a new baseball stadium for the Florida marlins but yesterday

[00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:02.900]
said the purpose beyond the council's action was not related to the prospective stadium deal

[00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:06.400]
with the development deals and that's a damn good thing because of anybody thinks that people are

[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:12.300]
going to go to highly at a wash baseball or race or anything they're dreaming am I right right

[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:18.800]
living in a dream world man living in the past the distant past you can't you can't go back

[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:23.180]
does not what they say can't go back that's what they say five six seven oh five six do you

[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:26.660]
I want to see these phones cranking or I'm just laying on the floor waiting for that knock on the

[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:30.980]
door which we got about two and a half hours two hours and twelve minutes forty two minutes five six

[00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:34.660]
seven oh five sixty pound five sixty and he got rise in singular rivals line probably the real

[00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:39.040]
macho guys in our crowd are busy shaving their armpits right now I don't see any calls on the

[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:44.560]
board there was one flash which I was going to take I see none I see zero zipety new dog so maybe we'll

[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:49.640]
play L. Jolson for about 45 minutes till that the package shows up thank you what are you laughing

[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:55.920]
about good format w.a.m. hello okay that's it that's a memory of our call right there we want

[00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:00.940]
the colors back the only you even out around today honey I thought you wish or I'll bring

[00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:06.400]
your phone that audience the people that kept saying that must have a short memory a short memory

[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:11.900]
uh-huh well we'll see let's see how that pole is coming thousand four votes oh look at that it's

[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:15.760]
not even eleven o'clock we got a thousand four votes and you put that on your kind of delayed last

[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:21.340]
night that is a really nifty neat though whatever Rick Shaw's retiring when should Neil retire that's

[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:25.880]
our question today whenever he feels like it four ninety one never four hundred and five now see

[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:29.840]
you put those two together got eight nine percent seems like kind of a self-serving pool to me doesn't it

[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:33.800]
like kind of like you're bending over and looking your own behind it seems like an excuse for a

[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:38.920]
pole so that you know you got some safe a good one for the next day return now fifty four five point

[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:44.380]
three percent say retire now instantly we've even finished the show today okay boy it is

[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:48.440]
clammy in here you know and that's because it's like sixty degrees I better crack a window in a few

[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:52.780]
years you ought to return thirty five soon ten like maybe by about one fifteen and I hate this

[00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:58.040]
pool only nine zero point eight percent number Joel Feinberg can easily and well relate to I

[00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:01.120]
believe it oh here we go and you're right I know you're going to be right you're going to say

[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:09.420]
say I told you so who cares wqyam hello Neil God yes sir how you doing I'm doing great um two

[00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:14.340]
things real quick one thing I love on your website uh is uh cartoon and I know there's no way

[00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:18.820]
for you to track that but I was school past all the bedtime stories just because they're pretty

[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:24.140]
insightful but um didn't know if you'd uh sort about the new I'm not a Beatles little tired but they

[00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:31.080]
got this new CD out called love yeah it's fantastic is it check it out well what what is it

[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:34.640]
there consistent I mean you know they're singing from the grave I mean what did they put on it

[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:40.820]
now they went back and as before George Harrison died and they um got the uh it's it was

[00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:46.020]
they put on a short du Soleil show out in Vegas and so they set it up for that like uh it's a

[00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:50.660]
really good Beatles mix man you know just when you thought there was nothing wrong

[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:57.620]
I hear another dead Russian from their proud mister Igor Gidar fell ill the after with the other guy

[00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:01.880]
died there and they're poisoning them all over that that's a coincidence though and uh more

[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:06.440]
out in the Israelis are very good with poison they're very uh a lot of expertise I'm sorry go ahead

[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:11.820]
with the Beatles yes and uh more Josh and less George okay thanks more Josh and less George he

[00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:17.020]
wants you Josh he's obviously a big fan seeing you wait now if you heard this a love thing this

[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:22.800]
beautiful love no I mean I know I like to be let's just fine love some of their stuff like the

[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:27.500]
white album was great mm-hmm not that old stuff on capital like your playing right there was

[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:31.240]
because most of it pretty marginal and some of the really weird old stuff like on swan records is

[00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:37.780]
really cheesy and corny and uh sound like they recorded it through a strainer no that was not

[00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:42.700]
the that old let's uh okay that's enough with a freaking Beatles already okay the Beatles if you

[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:47.100]
want to hear the Beatles turn out in rich or I hope they all the Beatles you want okay in his final days

[00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:51.500]
that would be a good autobiography the final days of rich or I don't mean like final days as far

[00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:56.000]
as in the planet I got a uh message on my space from rich or are you proud of that yeah

[00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:00.460]
and I sent him back a message saying hey you old fart old geezer something like that because he's

[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:03.700]
older than I am he's about the only guy I know who's older than I am I mean there are a lot of

[00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:07.380]
people who are older than me but I would know any of them you know what I mean by that mm-hmm

[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:11.960]
and I don't want to know old people if I want to know old people I go look into mirror now I was

[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:16.020]
thinking about the yesterday I'm sitting with mine I think about all those comments by me about the old

[00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:19.480]
farts which I don't apologize for any of them because they were all active at the old farts in

[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:24.240]
South Florida but now I'm an old fart myself but never like those old farts you know is that

[00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:29.820]
old fart choice oh god clear's the room in about two seconds and it will must be a

[00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:35.140]
white fart wow people run they scatter they scatter after they think you splatter but does it matter

[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:39.100]
that really I don't know let's continue with the silly eyes probably don't get any fatter

[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:44.300]
and I better not 192 this morning I'm proud of it I'm skinny and proud one I'm for me that's

[00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:48.980]
a pretty good number right now I'm gonna continue losing it and losing it and losing it until I look

[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:54.960]
just like Johnny Depp all right so I got a lot to lose I guess huh the turn what would be wrong

[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:58.280]
with looking like Johnny Depp and having his money okay I mean I got a little money but I'm like

[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:02.620]
a child's play compared to a guy like that I'm a piker compared to the big bus that Johnny Depp

[00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:06.340]
has got can you even begin to imagine the kind of money that that punk has got they used to

[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:11.740]
sleep in his car in Miramar and it was on my show on Zeta you know you know that's got to be that

[00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:15.840]

[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:32.860]
don't get any my space stuff from that crowd from back then from all those data listers I don't

[00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:38.360]

I don't believe this ever clear the question

[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:18.140]
That the Jewish man is he who can't see

[00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:25.600]

The Jewish religion go but you really should have cried

You should have cried, been not one single sense

[00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:43.620]
Because nobody can't as you can afford to pay rent

[00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:45.520]

[00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:47.040]
Shall I go away?

[00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:50.360]

[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:47.020]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60, the Verizon singular wireless line

[00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:49.180]
WQAM, hello

[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:49.800]
Hi Neil

[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:50.680]
Yes sir

[00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:53.120]
First of all, Joelson Rocks

[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:57.060]
Yeah, Joelson is a Althacocker who's a real rocker you're right

[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:03.680]
Neil, I was curious about something that about horse racing

[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:08.340]
If I could ask you really quickly I'm not a gambler I've never been well I've been to horse race once

[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:16.860]
People that enjoy horse racing, are there any people that actually enjoy the horse racing because of the horses?

[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:18.540]
Because of the beauty of them?

[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:23.140]
No bother

[00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:28.120]
In fact I got it right here, I'll put it on, on my TV I got the Racing Network H-JTN or whatever you call it

[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:33.420]
I watch it all the time, I could open up an account and then gamble online or on the phone I guess that's how it works

[00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:39.120]
I don't, I'd be broken if I did that, I have to be a crazy person but I enjoy watching them just because I love horse racing

[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:40.500]
And horse racing especially

[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:42.160]
There's this bunch of us

[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:48.400]
I asked this question to Hank and he called me basically everything but he did call me a pervert I think

[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:49.040]
Why is that?

[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:53.120]
And even after he hung up on it?

[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.980]
I enjoy gambling too but you know

[00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:57.720]
I guess I'm not kidding he went on and on I mean I got it

[00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:03.640]
They'll call him in the bitch him out about it don't be playing that games mister it's the same old stuff this is another reason with the calls

[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:08.880]
You know like a bunch of little kids in the sand like well I called Hank and he was going to call him back and bitch him out

[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:13.900]
Cussing out take it up with him I'm not going to be knocking the Humper right here how Humper's good people you know

[00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:16.900]
He's like a hell of a job in the morning there but then who expected that?

[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:21.000]
Nobody expected any big number there in the morning he's not a morning guy for a crime out loud

[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:26.080]
When you wait 800 pounds and they have to get you out of bed with a crane how to how can you do an early morning show right?

[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:32.240]
Right exactly. That's what you said when you start with that Barbara starcraft you are so you are just relentless man

[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:37.080]
Once once you get going boy you just keep digging like with Mo for example with a checkered pants and with a

[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:44.780]
Bad to pay all of which was true in the Dingleberries or culture that's right driver Robert Bennett for his self desire with Brad Borg

[00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:50.180]
Now there's Marty Adler wins a raceway Marty who kind of funfuses way but is a good guy good Jewish boy Marty Adler

[00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:55.660]
He funfuses call of the track of every race but he's a good people and we call this that day and the Airboy was that boring?

[00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:57.420]
Mm-hmm WQYM. Hello

[00:47:57.420 --> 00:48:03.820]
Uncle Neil how's it going? You hear about the big concert I don't know how much interest you'd have in this but maybe George and some of his

[00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:08.180]
Chronic out there some of his Ilkyah now in bulk of December 10

[00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:16.200]
That will please that up Frank's boys playing his music with Steve I Terry Boseo should be a big zoo

[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:17.440]
Shake up

[00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:27.460]
All right you hear that first that was coming back I think is what he said all right zombies out but yeah and guess what the first song is he's gonna sing?

[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:55.500]
I'm acting cool I got a cheer of either here once they help with my face but they'll do all the work and maybe later I'll be there

[00:48:55.500 --> 00:49:00.900]
Oh I'm speaking to maybe our rapers so last night on your buddy show you know your old buddy with the suspenders in the bag

[00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:08.280]
The hunchback of CNN anyway he had some it was the last night of the night before I don't know he had some chick on there who got raped he was the

[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:12.880]
Place kicker for Colorado was it I don't want to say the wrong university was the University of Colorado John?

[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:18.760]
Yes it was and she alleges that she got raped by one of the team members and this is a lot of back and she's written a book about it

[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:25.140]
Not she went to New Mexico and she's kicking her ass off there for her under Mexico and she's not getting raped in no mold how do you like that?

[00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:30.340]
She was kind of I don't know I don't want to she kind of strange looking you know and of course you probably thinking right off the bed

[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:35.280]
Oh she's a football lady football player and that means she's a dyke you know you know what you're thinking?

[00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:41.220]
Yeah I'm thinking of course that's what you're thinking because that's the way you guys think that's all you know from is this one's a dyke

[00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:45.220]
like Rick Shaw once said about my show. The way you guys think what?

[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:53.720]
I don't care whether she's a dyke or not what differences it make to me she was the hottest thing going and she was a dyke

[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:58.620]
and you'd probably be happy but I don't want to see the videos. I want to go on you cheer see her doing us something you know

[00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:04.180]
Whatever I'll give it a watch maybe she's in the carpet cleaning business maybe she doesn't have any.

[00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:10.260]
1044 on the poll there 1044 votes man we are really off to the races today speaking of whatever this guy

[00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:16.700]
you know I agree with his point but so Hank is the end of the gambling end of it okay Hank doesn't want to watch the races without plunging his guts out

[00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:23.140]
he's a gambling kind of guy that's his bag man that's his big fat bag and if he doesn't watch it pretty soon he's going to be wearing a bag

[00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:27.400]
God when I saw him on that breeder's cup day I thought I was going to scream at the TV

[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:34.480]
lose some weight you know lose announce I mean when you're like on the precipice of lyrgic exploding you know I mean you just lose

[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:42.240]

[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:53.160]

[00:50:53.160 --> 00:51:00.440]
which Josh can tell about that he won't buy that set but he'll think about in fact when you cast that check you could use that that would go a long way to buy and

[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:10.400]
George his Christmas gift would be a nice 52 inch Sam song yeah the LP you know that would be yeah I don't have my own Christmas gift that would be nice yeah that exactly

[00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:19.300]
I'll be be a beautiful thing but nevertheless 5 6 7 0 5 60 come on let's keep these great calls going let's see how long the audience can keep it up

[00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:27.380]
although we got this first the BBC reports that an anti smoking guru was helped millions of smokers kick the habit has died from guess what he died from cancer

[00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:40.800]
long cancer his last words were I'm dying over here Alan Carr 72 I wonder if he's came to Joey Carr maybe he's into dining and dancing Alan Carr 72 quit his 100 a day I have a 23 year 0 hundred

[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:49.280]
faggot's a day even I can't have that I bet you would yeah if I could all depending what they look like yeah line him up outside the door and let me start

[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:56.180]
right now maybe there's that knock on the door oh what are they knocking with quit his 100 a day have a 23 years ago before going out to become a

[00:51:56.180 --> 00:52:02.580]
millionaire by advising people how to stop smoking his books about the easy way method and become international best shoulders he ran clinics all over the

[00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:08.600]
world when he was diagnosed with a disease Mister Car said he saw the list is a way to encourage more people to quit talking at the

[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:14.980]
time of his diagnosis Mister Car said since I stopped smoking more than 23 years ago I've been the happiest man in the world I still feel the same way

[00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:22.320]
he's been told that he's cured at least 10 million smokers as a conservative estimate how do you like that Mister Car who died at his home near

[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:28.240]
Molliguy in Spain was diagnosed with an operable on cancer in the summer friend said it was possible that the years of he spent

[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:33.020]
curing smokers and smoke filled sessions at his clinics might have contributed to his illness although might

[00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:39.640]
also be linked to his previous heavy smoking he was a heavy duty smoker don't do what I do do as I say and make me a lot of money

[00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:48.640]
so I can die a horrible horrible death and they can have a long chew my throat we've all seen those things where people are so addicted to the nicotine that

[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:53.960]
even though they're dying from lung cancer on their deathbed and they have to pay chew so they can inhale the nicotine through the

[00:52:53.960 --> 00:53:02.420]
tube special cigarette holder tube designed just for them in fact it's the FDR cigarette holder Mister Car himself was convinced he would have died many

[00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:06.300]
years ago always if the appendix cigarette holder I'm not really sure what he's saying more

[00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:11.180]
that's just merited he'll tell if he comes back Mister Car himself was convinced he would have died many years

[00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:16.480]
earlier if he hadn't kicked the smoking habit he said given that I'm informed that I cured at least 10 million smokers even if that's the case

[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:22.420]
it's a price worth paying in other words he was willing to give his life so that others may live do we believe that no sounds good though

[00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:28.400]
and that's on great yes sure winner like Jesus he was kind of like the Jesus of the smoking field he gave his own life

[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:33.200]
so that others could be cured and could be saved and go to smoking heaven where it's smoked free by the way in heaven

[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:40.140]
you think they're smoking in heaven yeah Marley is it's healthy to their he gave up a county to set up his first clinic in southwest London

[00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:49.120]
1983 is since of 70 clinics in 30 countries how many 45,000 people last year his first book Alan Car's easy way to stop smoking has sold

[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:57.380]
more than 7 million copies celebrities have benefit from Mister Car's method includes Aranthony Hopkins and Sir Richard Branson guys with some serious bucks

[00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:03.840]
John Dicey worldwide director Alan Car's easy way said the fact that a former hundred of days smoker having quit in his middle age lived at the right

[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:09.780]
fold ages 72 is a tremendous miss out massage to all smokers it's a massage the kind of what's his name wanted reverend to Ted

[00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:15.820]
Alan Car's refreshingly different approach to stopping smoking random the position as the world's leading expert in helping smokers to quit

[00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:22.600]
and but it be pitiful for them up and now he's dead from lung cancer it goes to show it in fact isn't that that's the legacy left behind

[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:30.420]
just like Dr. Bob Mackins his legacy was don't slip and fall in the icy sidewalk which we have that here tomorrow and it's a damn and I see how psychic I am

I beg your pardon

[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:35.140]

we got no control over that and leave us alone already

[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:09.660]
and I'm waiting for that knock on the door

[00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:13.540]
and I'm uh... distracted because I was busy reading and responding when the email

[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:15.740]
which is one probably the most important thing of my life

[00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:18.160]

[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:20.940]

too carried away okay not my types we don't worry about it but i'm not worried

[01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:17.080]
not on your life based looking at your future but you're the other top okay here we go

[01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:23.540]
here we go starting with my ice cream listen i got the people that i'm like obsessed

[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:27.800]
with in case you haven't noticed and they know it and that's fun it's part of the

[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:30.460]
fun of life that's right i'm sure it would say it's cute like those radio

[01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:34.660]
quintages that disappeared you just climbed Jacob flatter i would like to but

[01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:37.440]
that's beside the point and gonna happen when you stop with this crap already

[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:41.700]
please well i didn't see that movie tonight i was a really straight right twice to see

[01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:45.480]
that movie i'm really glad somebody ruined it for me well now what was it about

[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:51.760]
i know i seen it he's dead no what was it about that's it i just told you no

[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:56.580]
seriously what was the movie about who's he and it's it's Tim robins in a convoluted

[01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:59.940]
bunch of visions and you don't know what's going on and at the end you realize

[01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:02.700]
that he's dead that's why you don't know what's going on at any point now that

[01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:07.780]
they can use time and i'm Jacob's ladder Tim robins oh well is he bobbin with robin

[01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:11.700]
from that i see more why sure was your head ability to put that stuff back on

[01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:14.240]
here but i don't i don't want to have fixed it come up here and posky around my

[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:17.800]
equipment you notice how well it works and i don't have any pos here where the mic

[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:22.200]
doesn't go on and off and stuff like that work out and like that yeah i don't have that

[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:24.920]
and you want to know why because there's nobody here to screw around with the equipment

[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:28.240]
that's the main reason why everything here stays in such p-mo condition is that

[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:30.860]
it's a beautiful little studio which i wish some day i said you a picture of i

[01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:33.600]
have that camera in there that digital camera yeah you know that we have the

[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:36.720]
my space page i could probably start putting stuff on there now that we have that

[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:40.820]
right as if having your own website wasn't enough of a reason yes now you have

[01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:43.020]
my space well what do we want to put it on our website for

[01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:46.180]
listen i told you say this picture is virtual screen our website is very

[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:48.820]
intellectuals who want to see naked pictures of Brady Quinn and stuff like that

[01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:52.280]
and a bunch of boobies on it no the boobies are one of my space page we got the

[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:56.020]
sliding boobies the slideshow and of course on the phone we got many boobies but

[01:02:56.020 --> 01:03:00.480]
that's beside the point and you know what who cares right right who cares so what

[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:03.280]
if that boys outselling anything he's busy punched me around with his

[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:07.340]
show that it's part of the course he's obsessed he's obsessed and if you

[01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:11.080]

[01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:26.060]
the ruchus

[01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:27.720]
force radio five sixty

[01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:28.160]
you

[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:28.740]
and

[01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:31.160]
dot

[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:37.160]
with

[01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:48.780]
though

[01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:59.420]
Solid

[01:07:59.420 --> 01:07:59.420]

[01:07:59.420 --> 01:08:01.140]
else

[01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:01.140]

[01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:01.140]

[01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:01.140]

[01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:03.140]
I've never quite heard it put that way before.

[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:09.080]
I like pizza, but the pizza here in South Florida is not all for me.

[01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:09.980]
Doi doi doi.

[01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:11.620]
Wow, this is quite a call we got on here.

[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:15.540]
I can take all the pizza and give it to me.

[01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:17.940]
E-E-E-A, doi doi doi.

[01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:24.360]
Now see here, I'm saying the pizza in Flavda is taro ball.

[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:29.120]
Anyone who says otherwise is wrong, g-g-g-g-g-g-g.

[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:31.720]
Yeah, well thank you for your real call, Morris.

[01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:33.400]
Right here on the candy embosso.

[01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:33.600]
Sure.

[01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:36.980]
We'll be right back after this massage from mobile massage.

[01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:39.380]
By the way, here you go again, pick it on a beer.

[01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:41.560]
It's like a death night you've got for those poor guys.

[01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:43.460]
Good guys and you're like racking on them.

[01:08:43.860 --> 01:08:44.280]
Sorry about that.

[01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:45.960]
You probably wrote that thing for a chicken egg.

[01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:47.520]
I rehearsed it and I did that voice too.

[01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:48.580]
20...

[01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:52.300]
Oh, what are we going to do about that situation?

[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.060]
27 till noon at 5.60 W.C.M.

[01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:58.080]
We got the Curtis for the Mandogger 2, and then the Humper for 3 hours.

[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:00.060]
Let a more cut of glasses off today, man.

[01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:02.820]
You see, I lost back 4 pounds of blood just a couple of days.

[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:03.520]
What is it, 3 days?

[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:05.820]
I had ballooned up to Gargantuan.

[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:09.100]
I'm not going to mess around with that 200 level ever again.

[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:10.300]
Remember, I've been with you a long time ago.

[01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:11.620]
I'm never going over 200 pounds again.

[01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:12.420]
Good guy.

[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:15.360]
It's the last thing I can do a fat old dying guy better than me, man.

[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:17.920]
I want to, you know, and I should have the lesson of lanceter

[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:19.280]
should be sticking to my mind, shouldn't it?

[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:19.700]
Yes.

[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:21.780]
Isn't that what that stands for when you run line, you know,

[01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:22.980]
L-O-L, lesson of lanceter?

[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:23.520]
Yes.

[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:24.240]
Right.

[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:26.960]
I should let that be a real lesson to me, you know, a guy with his kidneys

[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:29.940]
have gave out and his heart and has had a chop off part of his foot

[01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:30.720]
and then he died.

[01:09:31.260 --> 01:09:31.960]
Much, much prematurely.

[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:34.200]
And by the way, there's a classic example.

[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:35.080]
I mentioned this the other day.

[01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:38.840]
I'll say it again of idiots out there, mean-spirited rotten people,

[01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:42.500]
who after he the guy dies, they go and post comments on his blog.

[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:43.820]
They were like, I'm glad he's dead.

[01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:45.640]
And you know, I like that stuff like that.

[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:47.300]
And his pro wife's got to read that crap.

[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:48.280]
Don't do it, Mary.

[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:49.300]
Shut that baby down.

[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:50.020]
Really?

[01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:50.740]
God, please.

[01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:54.000]
See, this business about people, and that's another thing.

[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.660]
After reading some of that swill on my space, that's the part that bothers me.

[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.560]
I mean, you know, I can communicate with whoever I want if they, you know,

[01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:02.960]
if they pop up on there, like recently or whatever,

[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:04.840]
I can do that at my own whim.

[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:07.640]
But these comments from these wise-houtters out there like,

[01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:13.360]
oh, I see, you know, falling to the, what was that thing about public opinion?

[01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:14.380]
Caving to the printer.

[01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:17.980]
Caving to the printer, the tide of public opinion, whatever my thing calls again.

[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:19.100]
I'll do whatever I want.

[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:20.040]
How do you like that, Schmuck?

[01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:23.320]
Here's the guy that's probably making like 75 cents an hour, you know,

[01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:27.140]
shoveling a horse crap at the track or something, and he's giving me a song to dance about,

[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:29.000]
um, caving into public opinion.

[01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:32.860]
I'll do whatever I think makes the show listenable and good and fun for all of us, okay?

[01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:35.480]
I like the bedtime stories, but it was a lot of work, man.

[01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:38.000]
Sitting here, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, what is the door, I think?

[01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:38.460]
No, not.

[01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:39.660]
It's me banging on it.

[01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:42.440]
Speaking of radio, move over Rush Limbaugh says,

[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:43.920]
John Burnon, what is this from?

[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:44.840]
I'm something I don't know.

[01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:46.320]
Who don't even care his words from?

[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:47.260]
Anybody care where it's from?

[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:47.660]
Do you care?

[01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:48.560]
Who's known Burn?

[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:53.640]
Some Schmuck that writes for Ross story, how do you like that?

[01:10:54.480 --> 01:11:18.540]
Move over Rush Limbaugh and Schmuck, and Schmuck, and Schmuck, and Schmuck, and Schmuck,

[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:20.520]
for the flagship station.

[01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:24.860]
Two radio insiders who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed the move, both characterized

[01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:28.820]
the decision to move the Ed Schultz so from drive time to early afternoon, is one intended

[01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:30.680]
to bolster a rapidly growing national audience.

[01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:34.940]
Ed Schultz is kicking ass, baby, so we not only have to contend with Rush and with all the

[01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:37.900]
other swirllets on there, which we kick their ass all the time, not on a regular basis,

[01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:41.480]
but nobody writes about it, is now we got to put up with Ed Schultz, who sucks.

[01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:45.660]
The decision to move Schultz to noontime Eastern could put another nigga on the coffin of

[01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:47.660]
Air America, which filed for bankruptcy October 13.

[01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:54.120]
A 2006 survey by Talkers Magazine pegged the Fargo Talkers listenership at 2.25 million,

[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:56.760]
tying Schultz at number 10 among radio host nation wide.

[01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:00.440]
Air America's Al Franken ranked number 12 in the audience of 1.5 million.

[01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:04.240]
These guys are talking to millions of people, and I'm sitting here, you know, did a lot

[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:07.780]
of my toenails in South Florida, in the land of the walking dead, but you know something

[01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:08.400]
in no complaints.

[01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:12.400]
Norma Kent's doing a heck of a job, especially talking about clearance in his cute ass,

[01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:13.820]
you know, the important issues.

[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:17.800]
Limbaugh still dwarfs all liberal radio host and popularity with an estimated audience

[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:20.960]
of 13.5 million ditto heads idiots, morons.

[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:25.960]
According to the Talkers survey, down from 14.75 million in 2005, he's down a million.

[01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:27.780]
You don't think it's those pills, do you?

[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:30.980]
Sean Hannity pulls in roughly 12.5 million, more lemons.

[01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:34.900]
A spokesman for Schultz said he couldn't come out on the report but confirmed that a major

[01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:36.340]
announcement was made on his show today.

[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:39.840]
Schultz is expected amounts to change on today's program, which they just got through

[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:42.340]
right in it, and now they're ready to get it, just to make me look bad.

[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:44.880]
It doesn't get much more raw than raw story.

[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:45.440]
I'll tell you that.

[01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:47.140]
Of course some people like it raw, you know what I'm saying?

[01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:47.980]
That's what I hear.

[01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:48.740]
Like that.

[01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:52.820]
What is that appetizer that raw beef, what are they calling?

[01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:55.360]
You know what I'm talking about?

[01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:57.740]
I'm talking French restaurants to have that.

[01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:01.200]
And even raw, oh geez, geez Louise man.

[01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:04.300]
I worked in a French restaurant, and I don't know what you're talking about.

[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:05.400]
Well, so what's that?

[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:07.280]
Well you worked in a French restaurant, did they give you any females?

[01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:08.060]
Of course.

[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:09.620]
Are they still in business?

[01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:10.380]
Yes, they are.

[01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:11.440]
What happened?

[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:11.880]
Did you get fired?

[01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:14.400]
I was in high school, I don't work there anymore.

[01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:15.280]
What did you do?

[01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:16.320]
You moved out of dishwasher?

[01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:17.300]
I was a bus boy.

[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:18.640]
Oh, you were a bus boy?

[01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:20.940]
Well, I'll be there in a French restaurant.

[01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:22.200]
Then you got a job as a bus bench.

[01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:23.660]
Now how about the S-car go?

[01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:24.640]
Do you need any of them as snails?

[01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:25.560]
Love the S-car go.

[01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:25.880]
Sure bit.

[01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:29.240]
Oh yeah, looks like some kind of a seed food delicacy, but it's not.

[01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:34.220]
The edge Schultz show is owned by a product first to company held by former Clear Channel Executive

[01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:35.200]
Randy Michaels.

[01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:36.180]
Oh, that clown.

[01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:37.060]
Oh my god.

[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:37.940]
Randy Michaels.

[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:39.680]
A maven in the radio industry.

[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:40.460]
Just ask him.

[01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:44.940]
Product first president, Stuart Crane, first wife, vice president of ABC, was among those

[01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:46.880]
who helped pivot limbo out of the national stage.

[01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:50.940]
Schultz's chief competitor, Scare America, has threaded rocky water since its launch in

[01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:51.620]
2004.

[01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:57.560]
Since its inception, the privately owned company has lost more than $40 million, including

[01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:00.180]
13 million this year along the corner of the network's bankruptcy filing.

[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:03.360]
Schultz's show also privately held as not to disclose profit figures.

[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:04.300]
I'm taking nothing.

[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:05.580]
Nobody ever lost money on this show.

[01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:09.180]
So maybe the people over there at IOD, when they're owned by Cox Broadcasting.

[01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:10.720]
And I say Cox will hoist them.

[01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:16.600]
They couldn't make money with a halibus standing in the middle of Jerusalem for Kranor.

[01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:18.240]
Well, that's how desperate those bastards are.

[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:20.940]
And the only thing they could do is they took all their stations and turned them into a

[01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:22.100]
juu-box, speaking of Jerusalem.

[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:26.220]
That's all they know how to do is put on a juu-box, whether it was the coast or a hot 105.

[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:27.280]
And they're doing very well.

[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:28.760]
EDR, they bought that piece of crap.

[01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:29.720]
They're jamming it.

[01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:32.140]
I shouldn't be saying that because all the punks they want to hear that crap.

[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:33.480]
Another one here, Snoop Dogg.

[01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:34.360]
Here about as late as bust.

[01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:35.920]
Do you know we had a big bust?

[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:37.660]
That's what I heard from Arlene Drone.

[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:37.780]
You.

[01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:38.400]
Yesterday.

[01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:39.840]
All them drugs, man.

[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:40.600]
Snoop Dogg.

[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:43.140]
It's going to put him in real deep sorrows, deep do-do.

[01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:43.980]
Let's see.

[01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:44.780]
Rich Ross, retiring.

[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:48.760]
When should you ever tell me that now is up to 5.7%, 64 out of 1119.

[01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:50.380]
Up to almost 6% retire.

[01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:51.720]
Now, retire.

[01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:53.960]
I'll think about it.

[01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:55.180]
You know, I'm going to think about it very seriously.

[01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:57.420]
If they don't come with that knock on the door pretty damn soon.

[01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:02.660]
See, this is what, that's why, you know, the Dalmatian thing is so unusual.

[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.260]
Because they give you like a tour window.

[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:06.240]
I'm not doing another spot for them, but I'm just telling you.

[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:07.780]
And they actually show up in at two hours.

[01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:10.700]
But here's this thing that gives you like between 1030 and 2.

[01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:12.760]
I probably show up like a 15830, you know.

[01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:16.700]
As I'm playing the final dying bit there, you know.

[01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:17.660]
I final dying bit.

[01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:20.300]
Would that be something if I died like in the middle of a bit, you know.

[01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:21.280]
And never came back.

[01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:22.760]
Now what though would you be something?

[01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:25.480]
I'd play, uh, I'd play Manny.

[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:26.820]
Or maybe I should just play dead.

[01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:28.200]
What do you mean you'd play Manny?

[01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:28.760]
Manny what?

[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:29.520]
Manny from Kindle?

[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:31.100]
Play Manny from Al Jolson.

[01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:32.660]
Oh, Manny, I think you said Manny.

[01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:35.260]
Yeah, I'll play Manny from the morning show.

[01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:36.380]
Peeps in Likwam.

[01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:37.340]
Peda?

[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:38.340]
Yeah, random.

[01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:38.940]
Peda?

[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:39.600]
How you doing?

[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:40.880]
I'm all right, darling.

[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:41.440]
How you doing?

[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:42.900]
I got that Manny fight, huh?

[01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:44.320]
I got that Manny fight.

[01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:45.440]
Why'd you get fired?

[01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:46.700]
You have a critical ****.

[01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:47.740]
Oh, it's too bad.

[01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:48.060]

[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:51.180]
Why does Manny crank all the station?

[01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:52.200]
What is his problem?

[01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:52.860]
Because he can.

[01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:56.620]
19 to aluminum 560 W to come speaking of restaurants.

[01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:59.280]
It's lobster fest to be fried it through Sunday at the amazing

[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:00.140]
Animal Coast buffet.

[01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:02.320]
But when you're just in the mood to shovel that food down,

[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:05.320]
the best Chinese buffet in South Florida has got three locations for you.

[01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:07.500]
Sunrise, Pemberpies, and Sunny Oils, there's nothing like it.

[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:09.280]
Everything is crisp and fresh and delicious,

[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:11.860]
and there's enough food there to feed the Chinese army no less.

[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:13.180]
You think it's just a coincidence?

[01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:13.880]
Of course not.

[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:16.600]
Over a hundred different items featured on the Animal Coast amazing buffet.

[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:18.240]
No raw meat, by the way.

[01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:19.180]
What is that called?

[01:16:19.820 --> 01:16:21.900]
Is that carpactu of beef is out that isn't Italy?

[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:23.040]
I don't know what it is.

[01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:23.520]
Raw meat.

[01:16:24.020 --> 01:16:24.260]
Ooh.

[01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:27.360]
Six gourmet soups, New York steak, juicy and delicious grilled order,

[01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:29.120]
and cooked, by the way, the Animal Coast is not raw.

[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:32.020]
Handcarb primary of sushi, traditional Asian dishes.

[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:34.620]
There's a salad bar and a sea of bar.

[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:36.120]
And the dessert bar is really spectacular.

[01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:39.540]
Weekends feature the 40-inch mouthwatering chocolate fountain.

[01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:41.540]
You can hand it all kinds of neat stuff in there, man.

[01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:43.680]
It makes my mouth water just thinking about it.

[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.420]
You can hand it if your strawberry is marshmallows, cheesecake, other

[01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:48.840]
decadent treats, and loads of milk chocolate for dessert.

[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:50.880]
A perfect ending to a big feast at the Animal Coast.

[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:53.720]
And don't forget, you'll never want a lot of there with a headache from the M.S.G.

[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:54.700]
Because they don't use any.

[01:16:55.020 --> 01:16:56.820]
No crap, no cornstarch, no M.S.G.

[01:16:56.940 --> 01:16:58.440]
Only healthy cholesterol, freaking oil oil,

[01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:00.120]
and healthy ingredients go in anywhere.

[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:03.380]
And right now, when you go in as a party of four-ass for the Neal deal,

[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:06.540]
you get $5.60 set off through total checklist for paying adults.

[01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:11.440]
Animal Coast opened for lunch and dinner for reservations called 954-572-3822.

[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:14.560]
When you're in the mood for a real feast, this is the place.

[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:18.820]
954-572-3822, don't forget, every day is a Neal deal.

[01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:21.460]
They and every Friday through Sunday, it's lobster fest, back again,

[01:17:21.660 --> 01:17:23.500]
at the Animal Coast Chinese buffet.

[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:27.820]
The biggest name, so best talent to the dishes, meal Rogers,

[01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:30.420]
4th radio, 560-7.

[01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:34.460]
I got your breasts, they're beautiful.

[01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:38.240]
On Monday November 27, the interview that will shock the nation.

[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:40.160]
Come on, buy and stab two people like that,

[01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:41.940]
it will probably cut my hand or something.

[01:17:42.820 --> 01:17:44.160]
You can edit this, right?

[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:46.220]
Oh, Jasonson, right, did it.

[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:47.540]
Here's how it happened.

[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:50.360]
It's not like I grabbed a bunch of cars and got them the skies

[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:52.260]
and tried to go to Mexico.

[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:54.720]
Did I say that on loud?

[01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:59.460]
The two nights' charade begins Monday November 27 only on Fox.

[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:01.480]
14th of the noon, beef tartar.

[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:04.380]
And of course, if we got to hear that from John from MacColumbia South Carolina,

[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:05.660]
is it like a host whoop and eye on that?

[01:18:06.300 --> 01:18:07.540]
Well, I'm just trying to forget it.

[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:09.100]
I've had it not too long ago.

[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:09.480]
You have?

[01:18:09.740 --> 01:18:09.920]
Yeah.

[01:18:10.540 --> 01:18:11.260]
Beef tartar?

[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:12.320]
We had it.

[01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:13.020]
Why?

[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:16.500]
We read a Hungarian restaurant and the Hungarian said, hey, try the beef tartar.

[01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:16.900]
It's really good.

[01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:17.660]
Jasongulash?

[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:20.200]
People at the table had Gulash.

[01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:21.180]
I had some Guggen up.

[01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:23.100]
Oh, gee, I love beef tartar.

[01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:23.920]
I really hate it though.

[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:25.260]
It's got all noodles in it.

[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:26.440]
Right, but it was delicious.

[01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:28.140]
It was soaring sky high.

[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:29.560]
To the moon, no less.

[01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:31.320]
I had a little mustard dill sauce, which was great.

[01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:32.380]
A little mustard on it.

[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:35.860]
Speaking of eating mustard, I don't know who this is by.

[01:18:36.100 --> 01:18:39.900]
I just found this on the internet, which I better find everything on there I need at the moment

[01:18:39.900 --> 01:18:41.100]
until I shut that baby down.

[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:44.440]
The guy's name who posted this Howard Chang.

[01:18:45.780 --> 01:18:47.740]
And it says, what do I eat?

[01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:52.000]
As if somebody really cares about what Howard eats, but he thinks the word wants to know.

[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:54.600]
And of course, I did because I was just looking up for steak tartar.

[01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:58.020]
I just ruled it and I came across this rather bizarre thing.

[01:18:58.440 --> 01:18:59.940]
He says the answer is relatively simple.

[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:01.640]
I would eat just about anything at least once.

[01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:04.100]
Wow.

[01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:06.420]
Nice shirt don't go along with that, but nevertheless.

[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:09.560]
The only things that I do not eat are things that my body cannot handle.

[01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:13.380]
In general, I don't like things that are bitter, like certain vegetables, sour or too hot.

[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:15.400]
And see, I like sweet, hot and sour soup.

[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:16.620]
Don't you like that?

[01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:16.960]
No.

[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:19.060]
That's one of the soups you'll find at the end of the coast.

[01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:20.460]
Why don't you like hot and sour soup?

[01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:23.500]
I don't like sweet and sour, hot and sour, things like that.

[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:24.280]
Well, too bad.

[01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:26.500]
Then you shouldn't be working to queue them if you don't like sour.

[01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:27.320]
Good point.

[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:29.680]
I'm willing to give just about anything at least one chance.

[01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:31.200]
You see, in fact, I look forward to trying them.

[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:33.540]
I never refused to eat something simply because of the appearance.

[01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:35.500]
I've never been grossed out by anything yet.

[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.600]
Buckley's mixture gets pretty close but can't call it food cany.

[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:39.680]
What is Buckley's mixture?

[01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:40.320]
We don't want to know.

[01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:42.580]
If this guy won't, I don't want to find out.

[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:44.720]
He says, my favorite food group is meat.

[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:46.440]
My favorite meat is lamb.

[01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:48.220]
Oh, lamb.

[01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:48.900]
Oh, lamb.

[01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:49.740]
Gain me.

[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:51.440]
Gain me and slimy, baby.

[01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:52.120]
Slimy.

[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:52.720]
Very good.

[01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:53.420]
A little lamb.

[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:54.040]
You eat it.

[01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:54.460]
No.

[01:19:54.780 --> 01:19:56.400]
But I'm also very fond of beef duck.

[01:19:56.900 --> 01:19:58.460]
Duck is also a gain me and slimy.

[01:19:58.640 --> 01:19:59.300]
Although it's so...

[01:19:59.300 --> 01:19:59.340]
No.

[01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:00.060]
Creasy.

[01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:02.360]
Chicken, pork, fish, all seafood, etc.

[01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:04.040]
I have no problem eating in the edible parts of animals.

[01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:08.980]
For example, tongue, liver, kidney and intestines, heart, brain, bone marrow, sweet bread, etc.

[01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:09.880]
Oh, you've ate.

[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:11.380]
And this is the standard meat above.

[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:14.400]
Here's a non-exhaustive list of some exotic things I've tried.

[01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:18.800]
Birds, emu, goose, ostrich, pigeon or quail.

[01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:20.340]
This guy ate Dan Quail.

[01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:25.080]
Animals that live on land, alligator, bison, carobood, deer, frog, goat, frog.

[01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:27.060]
This guy went to Montreal, ate some frog.

[01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:29.320]
Goat, horse, rabbit, snail, snake and worm.

[01:20:29.780 --> 01:20:31.800]
Oh, this guy's eating worms for crying out loud.

[01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:34.140]
Seafood, cuddle fish.

[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:35.420]
I don't even know what that is.

[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:37.000]
I've heard it before, but what is a cuddle fish?

[01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:37.760]
It's a kind of squid.

[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:39.540]
It's a kind of little fish that you cuddle up with.

[01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:40.620]
Squid, squid, squid.

[01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:42.080]
Oh, hi, nice little fish.

[01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:42.860]
Squid, ask.

[01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:43.920]
Jellyfish.

[01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:45.180]
Well, I've seen a few of those.

[01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:47.660]
A lot of your octopus, EQ, cumber.

[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:48.800]
What is a CQ, cumber?

[01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:49.360]
I don't want to know.

[01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:51.760]
C. Urchin, shark, squid and turtle.

[01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:52.740]
Oh, a turtle.

[01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:54.720]
Like, myrtle, the turtle and this guy's eating my pet.

[01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:57.100]
Yeah, I think when I was a little kid, I had like a little one.

[01:20:57.100 --> 01:20:59.400]
There was little blue turtles like you buy in the pet story, you know?

[01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:00.440]
Myrtle, the turtle.

[01:21:00.820 --> 01:21:03.120]
And I don't think it was really dead, but we threw it in the garbage anyway.

[01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:03.860]
We thought it was dead.

[01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:06.580]
It just doesn't want to stick its head out for a while.

[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:07.440]
You know how that works, do you?

[01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:08.000]
Yeah.

[01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:12.500]
Insects, grasshopper, cricket, larvae, species unknown, scorpions.

[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:14.980]
And I'm always looking for new things to try, since this nerd.

[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:18.100]
He says, Chinese food, none of these are strange to me though.

[01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:19.460]
Maybe considered strange by others.

[01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:20.540]
Other were in old food.

[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:22.280]
Japanese, Korean, Malaysian, Singapore.

[01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:25.100]
Since I grew up in Hong Kong, he says none of these are too unusual for me.

[01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:26.340]
Hagus, Scottish.

[01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:28.060]
I don't mind if I find it a bit bland.

[01:21:28.220 --> 01:21:29.720]
Hagus is like intestines, isn't it?

[01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:30.740]
That is correct with us.

[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:31.340]
That's kisky.

[01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:32.720]
It's kisky's baby boy.

[01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:33.680]
I do love my kisky.

[01:21:33.980 --> 01:21:36.060]
But see, kisky's aren't kisky's in our intestines.

[01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:40.160]
Kisky is like a vegetable thing in the middle of a...

[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:44.360]
The only intestine is the wrapping around the outer edge of it.

[01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:44.680]
Correct.

[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:46.000]
It's flavored with the thingy.

[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:46.620]
What do we correct?

[01:21:46.980 --> 01:21:47.980]
Some go a little garlic.

[01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:50.960]
We went all through it during the show, Mr. Alzheimer's.

[01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:54.120]
We went all through what kisky is and how it's flavored with beef.

[01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:56.480]
You're here and I kisky's out there right now.

[01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:57.280]
I'll tell you how it's got some meal.

[01:21:58.820 --> 01:21:59.700]
What's that...

[01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:00.360]
That...

[01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:01.200]
That's right, that's right.

[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:02.000]
That's right, go over there.

[01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:02.640]
I'm not crazy about that.

[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:03.880]
By the way, what do you want to say about that?

[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:03.960]
I like that.

[01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:04.960]
Well, here's somewhere.

[01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:05.320]
I don't know.

[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:06.540]
I like Las Vegas Cuban restaurants.

[01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:07.340]
Thank you very much.

[01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:12.020]
I saw a lot of carretta somewhere in either here or the airport or somewhere, maybe Montreal.

[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:16.060]
They got good restaurants in Montreal, but boy, you sure you want to put up with those frogs or those people.

[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:17.680]
And the Quebec Nation, man.

[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:18.960]
Quebec Nation, my ass.

[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:19.980]
Oh, beef tartar.

[01:22:20.220 --> 01:22:21.260]
He says, I like raw beef.

[01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:28.340]
When I first had in Paris and Paris, Josh, French restaurant in Paris, I guess I didn't have to go to a nice place and it wasn't that great.

[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:28.980]
I didn't go.

[01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:31.300]
Since then, I've had beef tartar in Montreal twice.

[01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:32.000]
They were quite good.

[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.260]
My row in Lefbridge also has good beef tartar.

[01:22:35.260 --> 01:22:36.760]
In Montreal, I had a twice in Paris.

[01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:38.060]
Sounds pretty French to me.

[01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:39.320]
French restaurant.

[01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:41.420]
Yeah, see, that's a punk like Josh.

[01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:45.120]
He's a good kid, but he just got a big mouth and talks to what he doesn't know what he's talking about.

[01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:45.540]
Which is fine.

[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:46.020]
We like that.

[01:22:46.220 --> 01:22:48.240]
Yeah, because I worked there and they didn't have it.

[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:49.080]
And so they didn't have it.

[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:50.920]
Maybe it was a crappy French restaurant, okay?

[01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:54.260]
Maybe that's why, you know, anyway, Balloute, Philippine.

[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:55.020]
What is Balloute?

[01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:57.940]
Well, these are embryonated duck eggs that are hard boiled.

[01:22:58.400 --> 01:22:59.380]
Hard boiled duck eggs.

[01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:01.120]
You can see a baby duck in there.

[01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:02.520]
It says, oh, that's bad.

[01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:03.580]
Oh, that's bad.

[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.900]
Oh, right at lunchtime, you're doing this to us too.

[01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:07.500]
People eat the craziest crusts.

[01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:11.280]
It says, bones, feet, and beaks are crunching, giving you a very nice contrast and touch.

[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:13.860]
You can find these at the Asian supermarket in Lefbridge sometimes.

[01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:15.380]
There's obviously some brick jackass.

[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:17.040]
Lefbridge.

[01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:19.880]
Or is that Lefbridge, uh, could be Canadian too, Ontario?

[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:21.880]
Is this a guy from, I don't say.

[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:23.160]
Beef tongue.

[01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:24.640]
One of my favorite parts of the cow.

[01:23:24.740 --> 01:23:25.560]
Is there any part I don't like?

[01:23:25.660 --> 01:23:26.060]
He says no.

[01:23:26.340 --> 01:23:28.480]
If done right, very tender and extremely flavorful.

[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:30.320]
I think it absorbs flavor very well, tongue.

[01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:32.400]
Wasn't your tongue supposed to absorb flavor very well?

[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:32.900]
It's the idea.

[01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:35.220]
Fugu, which is blowfish.

[01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:35.900]
Fugu.

[01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:37.400]
Fugu, Fugu, Fugu.

[01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:40.140]
I had this during my trip to Japan in 2005.

[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:42.140]
All the other things I've eaten are gross to some people.

[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:45.160]
Only because of what they think, but this one can be truly dangerous.

[01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:46.740]
The fish has potent toxins.

[01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:48.440]
They must be prepared properly.

[01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:49.720]
Luckily, I'm still alive.

[01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:52.320]
The texture of Fugu is quite firm both wrong and could.

[01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:53.060]
Why have you had this?

[01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:54.220]
Uh, no.

[01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:55.320]
I know about it though.

[01:23:55.660 --> 01:23:57.980]
He says the cooked ones have quite a bit taste, almost like Grupper.

[01:23:57.980 --> 01:23:59.520]
Be a trooper and trisened Grupper.

[01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:00.260]
No thanks.

[01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:01.700]
That's a group of the short of me, man.

[01:24:01.820 --> 01:24:02.120]
No thanks.

[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:04.060]
Thank you, how is that Grupper fingers?

[01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:04.920]
Get out of here.

[01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:05.460]

[01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:06.780]
Grupper fingers my ass.

[01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:07.820]
I bet they do.

[01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:10.000]
In general, I don't like bitter or sour food.

[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.360]
He says other than that, the only category I'm not so keen on is desserts.

[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:13.500]
What a schmuck.

[01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:14.440]
Yes you are right.

[01:24:14.540 --> 01:24:17.400]
It's not the taste, but what desserts do to my body afterwards that drives me away from them?

[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:19.720]
Most desserts I made with unsurprisingly sugar.

[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:21.600]
And often contain dairy products and fruits.

[01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:22.720]
They make me sick, he said.

[01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:24.960]
I can eat a lot when it's something I like.

[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:30.060]
I like in general greasy, deep fried food very much, but I also like steak of most kinds of grilled meat.

[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:32.920]
Processed meat such as sausages, corn beef, bacon, etc.

[01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:34.060]
Also some of my favorites.

[01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:36.240]
In this, uh, simple eating.

[01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:38.560]
And in terms of fast food, nothing beats KFC.

[01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:43.260]
That's goes up until very recently they've been cooking it at the deep frying and at nasty, heavy, trans fat crack.

[01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:43.760]
And that's true.

[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:45.780]
I can eat it for lunch dinner and breakfast.

[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.080]
They used to have extra tasty crispy, formerly in Canada.

[01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:50.260]
Yeah, let's bridge Ontario, must be what he's talking about.

[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:51.900]
Now what was it that they have in Let's Bridge?

[01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:53.160]
He said something I don't want to try.

[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:54.000]
I don't even know where that is.

[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:54.880]
And I don't want to know.

[01:24:55.300 --> 01:24:57.980]
He says, unfortunately, it seems that was the only one that ordered this stuff.

[01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:02.300]
The only fried chicken, fried the chicken, ordered all the pre-cooked chicken with the original recipe.

[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:05.660]
They no longer sell it in Canada, probably because of a lack of customers.

[01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:06.600]
And on it goes.

[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:07.400]
Ah, and on.

[01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:07.580]

[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:08.300]
Here, we need anything.

[01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:09.540]
I know some guys like that.

[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:12.980]
1156 votes on our poll.

[01:25:13.140 --> 01:25:16.700]
We're going to spur some really sensational calls to the incase you missed it.

[01:25:16.980 --> 01:25:17.880]
You hear any of them?

[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:18.700]
Yeah.

[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:19.380]
No.

[01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:21.100]
1156.

[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:22.020]
What do we got so far?

[01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:23.880]
Rick Shaw announced his retirement on Tuesday.

[01:25:23.900 --> 01:25:25.560]
See, it said Rick Shaw is retiring.

[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:26.160]
Oh, that's right.

[01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:28.440]
So we're going to correctly retire him like after the first of the year.

[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:30.100]
Whatever Bob Hamlin says, get out of already.

[01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:31.800]
Take your cap and get lost.

[01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:35.260]
No, but I'll probably give him like a big send off, wouldn't you think?

[01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:36.560]
Just like we get here at QA.

[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:36.720]
Right.

[01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:38.280]
Big kiss on the ass.

[01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:39.440]
Rick Shaw is retiring.

[01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:40.260]
When should Neil retire?

[01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:44.300]
Uh, whenever he feels like it, 554 or 47.4.9%.

[01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:45.700]
That's Dan Whitey of folks.

[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:47.640]
God, it's enough to make me pleased as puncher.

[01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:50.040]
Where the hell is that knock on the door of my damn facts machine?

[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:50.860]
I heard my package.

[01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:52.200]
I think they're jerking you around.

[01:25:53.460 --> 01:25:54.180]
Never, 475.

[01:25:54.380 --> 01:25:55.020]
Never should retire.

[01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:55.800]
41%.

[01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:56.300]
Never.

[01:25:56.420 --> 01:25:58.120]
Just keep going until you croak right there, man.

[01:25:58.340 --> 01:25:59.000]
We'd love to hear that.

[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:02.900]
Now we should return now 66 back up to 5.7%.

[01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:04.320]
That's not a real good design.

[01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:04.960]
That's your crowd.

[01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:05.640]
They want to hear you.

[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:06.500]
And here's George.

[01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:11.280]
Hey, in a few years, 40 soon, 11, like a sooner than later.

[01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:12.080]
And I hate this poll.

[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:13.640]
Solamente D.H.E.

[01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:14.800]
Soltanto D.H.E.

[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:16.620]
See, when you miss the languages like that, it's very confusing.

[01:26:16.980 --> 01:26:18.560]
And I get the numbers in the whole dealer.

[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:19.640]
It is confusing to me.

[01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:20.480]
It bothers me a lot.

[01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:22.340]
The Spanish and Italian.

[01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:23.460]
And what about the frog?

[01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:24.580]
How do you say 10 in French?

[01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:28.240]
You have the most convoluted numeric of this world.

[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:28.840]
You're in the world.

[01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:31.500]
I say, I don't know.

[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:33.640]
Seth Greenberg.

[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:35.000]
Seth Greenberg is going to be on.

[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:35.520]
All right.

[01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:36.780]
We got several segments with Seth.

[01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:39.380]
We don't know what he does, but at least he's Jewish.

[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:40.840]
The biggest name.

[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:42.760]
So best talents to the business.

[01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:43.900]
Real Rodgers.

[01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:45.740]
42560.

[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.020]
You A.M.

[01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:49.880]
This is Dick Cheney.

[01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:53.400]
I like to relax by having Mary Magdalene massage my balls while listening to the Neil

[01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:54.380]
Rodgers welcome one hour.

[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:55.460]
Hey.

[01:26:58.400 --> 01:26:58.860]
Hey.

[01:26:58.860 --> 01:26:59.180]
Hey.

[01:26:59.200 --> 01:26:59.480]
Hey.

[01:26:59.820 --> 01:27:00.280]
Hey.

[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:00.380]
Hey.

[01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:00.760]
Hey.

[01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:07.120]
Hey.

[01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:09.580]
Hey.

[01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:11.100]

[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:11.320]
Hey.

[01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:11.380]

[01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:11.380]

[01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:13.400]
Hey.

[01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:14.420]

[01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:14.460]

[01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:14.600]
Hey.

[01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:16.820]

[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:17.000]

[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:17.000]

[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:17.000]

[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:17.000]

[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:25.820]
Yo Yo he.

[01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:41.380]
If you're on the verge of going to jail, coming to jail, here's a foolproof plan that will never fail.

[01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:47.320]
Don't get in as God and say you love way.

[01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:52.560]
If you get in trouble, say you're gay.

[01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:54.140]
Get out, be gay.

[01:27:54.900 --> 01:28:00.960]
The empty area, when you're not through the press.

[01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:01.780]
You're free.

[01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:04.240]
You've been training in a dress.

[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:06.660]
Be surprised.

[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:08.400]
You like God.

[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:11.420]
Never be honest.

[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:14.580]
I said don't work that way.

[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:19.240]
If you think something wrong just say you're gay.

[01:28:21.980 --> 01:28:27.980]
If you get arrested for peddling loans,

[01:28:29.180 --> 01:28:31.440]
that's a perfect high.

[01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:34.120]
To say you like to.

[01:28:35.860 --> 01:28:40.720]
Whistle some showtoons from your favorite way.

[01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:45.820]
If you get in trouble, just say you're gay.

[01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:47.640]
Just say you're gay.

[01:28:48.700 --> 01:28:50.080]
So anyway, I'm gay.

[01:28:50.460 --> 01:28:51.440]
1202 at 560.

[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:54.700]
That kind of like, it notculates me against any problems at all.

[01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:56.940]
I'm sure you're getting murky here, man.

[01:28:57.460 --> 01:28:59.320]
Getting dark and dark and murky.

[01:28:59.420 --> 01:29:01.440]
I think that big storm is coming into big blow.

[01:29:02.060 --> 01:29:02.520]
And you know what?

[01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:02.860]
What?

[01:29:03.260 --> 01:29:03.660]
That blows.

[01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:06.160]
But it's a 59 degrees for quite a lot.

[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:09.480]
And it's going to be raining and sleet and snowing and freezing out.

[01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:10.640]
Better get my cleats on.

[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:13.160]
Remember, cleat boy played third base for the anchors.

[01:29:13.380 --> 01:29:13.720]
Cleat?

[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:14.660]
Like tourist boy.

[01:29:15.340 --> 01:29:17.800]
Bob Geiger writes, and why do people say cleit tourist?

[01:29:17.980 --> 01:29:19.340]
I mean, what kind of a moron says that?

[01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:20.340]
I'm sorry, Joyce.

[01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:22.460]
She has a real, she's nervous about that.

[01:29:22.460 --> 01:29:23.080]
Is she?

[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:23.800]
Yeah.

[01:29:24.020 --> 01:29:25.140]
This is, she's nervous about it.

[01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:27.980]
In fact, that's probably why she farts so much, is because she's nervous.

[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:30.580]
Isn't that what they say about people that were nervous that they fart?

[01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:32.340]
I've never had that problem.

[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:33.500]
Of course, I'm not a nervous person.

[01:29:33.580 --> 01:29:34.280]
I'm a nervous wreck.

[01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:36.880]
But that's because I work for this company in this business.

[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:41.120]
But I never really, I don't know, I'm not one of those people that nervous farts.

[01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:43.400]
I fart a lot because I'm big and fat, you know, and old.

[01:29:43.780 --> 01:29:47.340]
See, when you get older, you blow them out and you do it not even aware of it.

[01:29:47.380 --> 01:29:47.960]
You're not even trying.

[01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:50.980]
You just hope that it's like, you know, yeah.

[01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:51.200]
Yeah.

[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:53.560]
It's what you think it's going to be.

[01:29:54.180 --> 01:29:56.660]
Bob Gagger says, day 1900, no Osama.

[01:29:57.220 --> 01:30:01.000]
When I can start getting back into reading some of these things, well, I feel like I can mix

[01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:01.900]
and match, you know what I'm saying?

[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:04.400]
Because it's not like there's any cause on the board right now.

[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:08.120]
Although once the delay catches up, it'll be, it'll be smoking, baby.

[01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:09.380]
It'll be smoking.

[01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:10.760]
I can't tell you what it's going to be smoking.

[01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:13.220]
That guy who died when they were lung cancer, he'll tell you.

[01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:18.300]
Bob Gagger says, I usually post a latest update to my Osama clock on Mondays, but I just wanted

[01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:22.660]
to note that effective today, November 30th, it's been 1900 days since top talking George

[01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:26.880]
W. Bush said he was smoke Osama bin Laden out of his hole and Neil and better alive.

[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:32.060]
In the massive universe of ways Bush has exploited our nation's tragedy on 9-11, few things

[01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:35.440]
seem to have brought him more political capital with the American people in his swagger and

[01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:38.120]
fake resolve to bring those who attacked us to justice.

[01:30:39.380 --> 01:30:42.720]
He's going to bring him to justice and anybody with a brain knows for justice, we've got

[01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:43.260]
to go see.

[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:44.260]
Don Koryon.

[01:30:44.460 --> 01:30:44.840]
That's right.

[01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:47.660]
Anybody with half a brain knows that, of course, that leaves you present enough.

[01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:48.340]
Schmuck.

[01:30:49.100 --> 01:30:53.320]
Anyway, he stood on the rubble of ground zero in New York City and said that bad guys would

[01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:57.120]
hear us all soon and followed that a few days later by invoking imagery of the Old West

[01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:59.760]
and saying he would get us some bin Laden dead or alive.

[01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:04.020]
Of course, just six months later that resolve was gone and Bush Langley said to reporters

[01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:05.600]
that bin Laden just wasn't that important.

[01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:08.440]
I don't know where he is, said our iron-willed macho man.

[01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:11.380]
You know, I just don't spend that much time on him, be honest with you, he said.

[01:31:11.780 --> 01:31:16.060]
We can tell because we sit here at day 1900 and have been live and running free and continuing

[01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:18.120]
the podcast periodic threats to our country.

[01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:22.360]
It's time to be focused on our global fight against terrorism, Senator Russ Finegold

[01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:25.460]
to remember the Senate Intelligence Committee said in June, we must move away from the

[01:31:25.460 --> 01:31:29.760]
rec-centric policies that are draining our resources and focus on how kind and affiliates

[01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:32.800]
are reportedly operating in some 60- to 80 countries around the world.

[01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:34.000]
You should live so long, Russ.

[01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:37.680]
A good way to start might be for us to actually mad the guy we promised to get five years

[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:37.960]
ago.

[01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:41.280]
I work in New York City where Bush made his bullet claims and continue that while New

[01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:44.320]
Yorkers love tough talk, they have little respect for people who can't back it up.

[01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:46.480]
So you're all Mr. Bush, we're in the house of Osama.

[01:31:46.900 --> 01:31:50.420]
Hey, yo Bush, just like you said, a Tony Blair, remember that when he was a Chinese

[01:31:50.420 --> 01:31:50.800]
cut?

[01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:56.720]
A redneck from Texas, some kind of a Yahoo redneck, Chong and Chou with his mouth open,

[01:31:56.760 --> 01:31:58.380]
like some kind of a clutz.

[01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:01.720]
Of course, keep in mind, daddy's the one that like, kicked it all over the table with

[01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:02.360]
a Japanese there.

[01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:04.080]
Maybe daddy didn't like that sushi, you know?

[01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:04.920]
It's possible.

[01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:06.320]
Oh God, yeah.

[01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:09.000]
You know, as much as I detest 50, I do eating sushi.

[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:11.940]
Oh, something that's stirring back at me.

[01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:13.340]
Oh, not at all.

[01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:18.220]
Brother, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, let's get a call segment in here.

[01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:19.400]
Okay, let's kind of mix and match.

[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:20.780]
Do you think the audience can handle this?

[01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:20.940]
No.

[01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:22.020]
Can I keep up with me now?

[01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:22.640]
That's a problem.

[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.440]
For a daughtering old fart like me, you guys just can't keep up.

[01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:27.380]
Of course, the seven minute delay doesn't help.

[01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:31.360]
5.5%, 66 per, what is it?

[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:32.360]
66 people.

[01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:33.800]
We're tired.

[01:32:34.100 --> 01:32:34.800]
Now, right now.

[01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:39.040]
Before you finish this sentence, just like Howard Beale said, right in the middle of

[01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:39.360]
that.

[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:39.700]
Remember that?

[01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:40.420]
Of course.

[01:32:40.740 --> 01:32:43.540]
And you can drive through, because he'll fall asleep by that point in the movie.

[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:45.380]
It turns it off right in the middle of that sentence.

[01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:49.260]
Television is not the truth.

[01:32:49.860 --> 01:32:51.820]
So turn off your television sets.

[01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:53.940]
Turn them off right in the middle of the sentence.

[01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:54.920]
Like that.

[01:32:55.260 --> 01:32:56.140]
That's how I'm going to do it.

[01:32:56.160 --> 01:32:57.780]
I'm going to go out like random in the, like that.

[01:32:58.860 --> 01:32:59.520]
WQA, I'm hello.

[01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:02.560]
WQA, I'm Ola.

[01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:04.520]
How are you doing?

[01:33:04.620 --> 01:33:06.080]
Nate, I was talking about getting nervous.

[01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:09.200]
I just got out of a nervous hospital over in Canter.

[01:33:09.860 --> 01:33:15.160]
And as I say, what he used to really make my stomach nervous was I'm Brent Strod,

[01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:16.320]
Pater's biscuit.

[01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:17.340]
Okay, good.

[01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:20.900]
He got out of a nervous hospital.

[01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:23.840]
Now you got to see Slim White.

[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:25.460]
He was doing Carl for Slim White.

[01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:26.280]
What was he really?

[01:33:26.460 --> 01:33:27.400]
I haven't seen Slim White.

[01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:27.960]
Nervous, huh?

[01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:28.720]
Slim White.

[01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:30.340]
That was pretty cute.

[01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:31.060]
Cute movie.

[01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:32.340]
You got to have a nervous hospital?

[01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:33.440]
A burn you a copy.

[01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:35.000]
Did I have a nervous hospital in Slim White?

[01:33:35.060 --> 01:33:35.920]
Yeah, he also said.

[01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:38.340]
Bobo said two men are not laid together.

[01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:39.160]
Nice.

[01:33:41.340 --> 01:33:42.520]
1180 votes on the poll.

[01:33:43.820 --> 01:33:48.060]
5670560, pond 560 on me for Ryzen and the Slim White line.

[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:49.240]
So a singular Ryzen line.

[01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:50.640]
Slim White in my ass.

[01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:52.580]
Okay, I'll go get the knife.

[01:33:53.340 --> 01:33:54.100]
Get the rubber band.

[01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:55.060]
WQA, I'm hello.

[01:33:55.060 --> 01:33:55.620]
That's for Roy.

[01:33:55.780 --> 01:33:56.560]
QA, I'm hello.

[01:33:57.540 --> 01:33:58.680]
Remember the rubber band band?

[01:33:59.200 --> 01:33:59.580]
I'll do.

[01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:00.080]
Come here.

[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:00.560]
Yes, sir.

[01:34:00.780 --> 01:34:01.140]
Hello.

[01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:01.840]
Hello.

[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.860]
I was calling about the fan of QA football.

[01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:08.140]
Isn't that something?

[01:34:08.380 --> 01:34:11.240]
That guy, he's got that phone just keeps, he just keeps swallowing that baby.

[01:34:11.660 --> 01:34:12.740]
He keeps going right down his throat.

[01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:14.600]
WQA and hello.

[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:17.780]
Yeah, what's the old one under on this weekend thing?

[01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:18.860]
88.

[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:21.140]
It's the great, it's the old 88.

[01:34:21.460 --> 01:34:22.280]
I like that, schmuck.

[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:24.060]
WQA and hello.

[01:34:24.540 --> 01:34:25.500]
Yeah, we're going to have to do it.

[01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:26.060]
Yes, sir.

[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:26.620]
Good afternoon.

[01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:26.980]
Good evening.

[01:34:26.980 --> 01:34:28.000]
Good evening and top of the day.

[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:31.140]
Probably about a week ago.

[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:33.360]
Oh, there's a richer question with those donkey teeth.

[01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:34.480]
Seems a little sucker's factory.

[01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:35.060]
Oh, god.

[01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:35.980]
Why don't you just run away?

[01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:37.600]
He's the last person I ever want to see again.

[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:38.080]
Go ahead, sir.

[01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:43.140]
A week or so, though, I probably would have voted to retire now only because you know,

[01:34:43.220 --> 01:34:44.140]
you weren't taken call.

[01:34:44.340 --> 01:34:45.820]
And the show was getting kind of...

[01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:46.320]
Ponderous.

[01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:47.300]
Oh, yeah.

[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:50.980]
I mean, with the reading of the news all day, you were starting to sound like a poor

[01:34:50.980 --> 01:34:51.580]
beef.

[01:34:51.580 --> 01:34:52.160]
Good day.

[01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:54.880]
What?

[01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:59.980]
You know, the thing that's funny about the calls isn't that the content is funny.

[01:35:00.180 --> 01:35:01.520]
It's just that they're so bad, you know?

[01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:01.820]
Right.

[01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:02.840]
It's like a trade ring.

[01:35:03.100 --> 01:35:07.380]
That your attempts are 99% of them are 99 to 99% percent of them are so lame.

[01:35:07.620 --> 01:35:09.040]
That's why I'm doing the show and you're not.

[01:35:09.180 --> 01:35:12.600]
That's why I'm making the big bucks and you're out there pushing a push card in central

[01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:14.500]
park somewhere, selling the kishki.

[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:16.020]
Oh, I'll take some, by the way, for lunch.

[01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:18.500]
I wish they all I could find a place to go with kishki.

[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:21.480]
I know that place that Rimmer took me that time, which is out in the Annem'sville, somewhere.

[01:35:21.740 --> 01:35:23.800]
Why do you keep using these Yugoslavian words on here?

[01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:25.260]
There ain't even no more Yugoslavia.

[01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:26.660]
W.A.

[01:35:26.660 --> 01:35:26.780]
Q.A.

[01:35:26.860 --> 01:35:26.920]
M.

[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:29.580]
Q.A.

[01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:29.800]

[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:31.320]
Hey, M.

[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:31.960]
How you doing, buddy?

[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:33.320]
Very good, excellent.

[01:35:33.740 --> 01:35:34.040]
Hey, man.

[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:35.720]
Long, first time, long time.

[01:35:35.860 --> 01:35:37.700]
I'm calling to get the thing in the meat.

[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:39.420]
The raw meat, isn't it steak tart tart?

[01:35:40.180 --> 01:35:40.960]
Steak tart tart.

[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:41.480]
That's it.

[01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:42.580]
All right, man.

[01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:43.220]
You have a good afternoon.

[01:35:43.540 --> 01:35:43.920]
Thanks a lot.

[01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:46.880]
We only listened to it in like 20 minutes ago, but this guy's busy on the phone.

[01:35:47.100 --> 01:35:47.100]

[01:35:47.220 --> 01:35:47.880]
I want to go to the office.

[01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:48.860]
Okay, just relax.

[01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:51.680]
See, these things don't drop off under supposed to.

[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:53.140]
I hit the drop off thing 50 times.

[01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:54.120]
Oh, my God.

[01:35:54.180 --> 01:35:56.040]
Are we having a technical problem here on this end now?

[01:35:56.220 --> 01:35:57.960]
Wouldn't that be bad and unusual, too?

[01:35:58.400 --> 01:35:58.680]
I don't know.

[01:35:58.920 --> 01:35:59.880]
How do we order a bit of that yesterday?

[01:36:00.380 --> 01:36:01.100]
Steak tart tart.

[01:36:01.460 --> 01:36:03.020]
Maybe that's why I'm puking my guts out.

[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:04.360]
W.A. Q.A. and hello?

[01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:05.400]
Hello, Neil.

[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:06.160]
Yes, sir.

[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:07.240]
Hey, how are you?

[01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:07.660]
Excellent.

[01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:10.300]
You were mentioning like a redder.

[01:36:10.380 --> 01:36:12.860]
There is one at Miami International Airport, then.

[01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:15.660]
I wouldn't need to verify with you.

[01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:16.820]
Well, why do you mean by that?

[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:17.280]
Why is that?

[01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:18.500]
Well, I worked there.

[01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:20.860]
Yeah, that's why I should not eat there.

[01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:21.940]
Because you work there.

[01:36:22.100 --> 01:36:24.860]
I don't want to hear some kind of crap you're going to come up with about how they got like, you know.

[01:36:25.460 --> 01:36:26.100]
La Carretta.

[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:29.120]
He works there when they got like, yeah, you work there, my ass, okay?

[01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:30.020]
You work there.

[01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:32.860]
They wouldn't let it all lose it like you come within a hundred yards of La Carretta.

[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:35.600]
No, I'm talking about outside of there.

[01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:36.460]
I've seen one.

[01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:37.420]
I've seen one.

[01:36:37.740 --> 01:36:39.120]
I can't let someone use replace it.

[01:36:39.220 --> 01:36:40.300]
Maybe it was in Europe somewhere.

[01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:41.140]
It was La Carretta.

[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:41.960]
I think it was.

[01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:43.660]
Maybe it was in Amsterdam.

[01:36:44.220 --> 01:36:45.500]
Oh, you sure don't want to eat there, either.

[01:36:45.780 --> 01:36:46.860]
That's what I hear from you.

[01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:50.340]
Oh, I'm sorry, but it's just anybody who tells you otherwise.

[01:36:50.820 --> 01:36:51.960]
Just laugh at him.

[01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:57.380]
Just look at him and just fall down on the floor and hold your size and laugh and giggle and act like some kind of a nitwit.

[01:36:57.460 --> 01:36:58.920]
Act like you're having a spastic fit.

[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:01.340]
Because the food and Amsterdam rhymes with the fit.

[01:37:01.820 --> 01:37:02.340]
It is inedible.

[01:37:02.980 --> 01:37:03.380]
It's crap.

[01:37:03.540 --> 01:37:04.160]
Oh, there's Maliki.

[01:37:04.780 --> 01:37:05.400]
As they say.

[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:06.140]
Yeah, he's a clown.

[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:09.900]
1191 on there and 67 say, we're tired now.

[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:11.640]
So that's the only number we need to look at.

[01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:13.380]
The rest are just lucky, lucky, kissy, kissy.

[01:37:13.660 --> 01:37:17.020]
That's an important number, 5.6%, which fits right in when that queue 56.

[01:37:17.300 --> 01:37:18.400]
See what all fits in together?

[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:20.780]
I've got you Joe Feinberg voted on that many times.

[01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:22.000]
The biggest name.

[01:37:22.300 --> 01:37:25.240]
So I'm saying Joe, fight your ass, or you jackass.

[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:27.960]
Force radio 560s, you A-M.

[01:37:30.020 --> 01:37:31.380]
Rendolando el pollo para acá.

[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:42.260]
If you see a blown up car on the side of the road,

[01:37:42.260 --> 01:37:46.080]
you know your deep in the heart of fire.

[01:37:46.380 --> 01:37:47.240]
I'm right.

[01:37:48.180 --> 01:37:50.200]
I'm right here.

[01:37:56.380 --> 01:38:01.400]
We're heading down that danger in highway.

[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:07.540]
Try to dodge the bullets and get away.

[01:38:08.580 --> 01:38:11.560]
I'm boiling and my skin away.

[01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:14.560]
I'm running and I'm just making the whale.

[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:17.100]
And we're driving around back dead.

[01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:17.880]
I'm right.

[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:22.380]
I got me a homie bird that thinks about 20 slow.

[01:38:22.660 --> 01:38:25.140]
Hurry up and find that outbar.

[01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:26.040]
How it ends?

[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:27.240]
I'm right.

[01:38:27.620 --> 01:38:32.820]
It's a little place where in search of gifts together.

[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:36.960]
I'm right, baby.

[01:38:38.300 --> 01:38:39.480]
In a bike rack.

[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:42.940]
In a bike rack.

[01:38:43.180 --> 01:38:43.920]
Don't know.

[01:38:46.060 --> 01:38:47.440]
We've got some action here.

[01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:48.840]
In a bike rack.

[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:52.000]
In a bike rack.

[01:38:55.740 --> 01:38:57.440]
1217, they got sore, sore, sore, and there, baby.

[01:38:57.580 --> 01:38:58.440]
They make no mistake about it.

[01:38:58.540 --> 01:39:00.220]
The Iraq attack and everybody is saying, well,

[01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:01.720]
but a beep, but a boop, but what do we do now?

[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:02.580]
Nobody's got no answers.

[01:39:02.580 --> 01:39:04.420]
Including the Democrats and anybody else.

[01:39:04.620 --> 01:39:06.520]
But that's what happens when you're in a quagmire.

[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:08.360]
And I'm saying, well, kind of like us here at QAM.

[01:39:08.540 --> 01:39:09.900]
We're in a quammire.

[01:39:10.540 --> 01:39:11.800]
Oh, you can't take the G up.

[01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:13.960]
In fact, if you put a G in there, wouldn't it be a quagmire?

[01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:15.120]
I mean, what's spelled right?

[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:17.520]
QAGM, a quagmire.

[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:18.120]
A quagmire.

[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:21.380]
From 109 votes on the pull, man, we are really moving along.

[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:23.100]
We're just racking them up.

[01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:23.520]
Big time.

[01:39:23.860 --> 01:39:24.880]
Calls the phone is dead.

[01:39:25.620 --> 01:39:28.280]
Now, why are we supposed to care what happens on the view?

[01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:31.700]
I saw Tucker Carlson without the bow tie again last night on MSNBC.

[01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:33.300]
And he was ranting and raving.

[01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:35.320]
He's got some silly ass queen on there with him.

[01:39:35.460 --> 01:39:38.220]
Why even Keith Olberman's got some queen from the village voice on there?

[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:39.240]
I don't know what the guy's name is.

[01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:40.200]
I don't know what her name is.

[01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:41.640]
Some screamer.

[01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:44.280]
This is the new, uh, who was the one that started that?

[01:39:44.540 --> 01:39:45.280]
Was I'm with King?

[01:39:46.020 --> 01:39:46.700]
Started what?

[01:39:47.100 --> 01:39:52.700]
This business of every, every one of these talking head shows has to have their resident queen entertainment reporter.

[01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:53.040]
Whatever.

[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:53.880]
Oh, I don't know.

[01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:56.160]
Probably entertainment tonight started that.

[01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:56.540]
I don't know.

[01:39:56.540 --> 01:39:57.360]
Whoever started it.

[01:39:57.520 --> 01:39:58.100]
I ought to be shot.

[01:39:58.100 --> 01:40:00.340]
But anyway, he's got this queen on there.

[01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:02.060]
But I'll be better but I'm talking about the view.

[01:40:02.420 --> 01:40:04.860]
Well, first of all, not one straight guy in the world watches the view.

[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:05.640]
I write about that.

[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:06.280]
You're right.

[01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:07.120]
Absolutely.

[01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:10.360]
In fact, the only people who watch the view are the ones you're always talking about.

[01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:11.700]
The fat, shut-in, sure.

[01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:13.300]
Trailer, trash, women.

[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:15.340]
Those are the ones that watch the freaking view.

[01:40:15.900 --> 01:40:20.800]
But Boide sure made some heavy-duty crap about this and admittedly sloshed Danny DeVito.

[01:40:21.820 --> 01:40:26.160]
Staggered out of the view yesterday, cracking jokes about having sex with his wife in the White House

[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:29.620]
and getting bleeped on the live show after calling President Bush Numbnuts.

[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:30.160]
He got bleeped.

[01:40:30.860 --> 01:40:31.140]
Mm-hmm.

[01:40:31.780 --> 01:40:36.480]
DeVito was promoting his new movie Deck the Halls, walked out of the show, said unsteadily,

[01:40:36.820 --> 01:40:40.880]
and attributed the slurred speech to Somalmite Corousing with his pal George Clooney.

[01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:44.320]
I knew it was the last seven lineman cellos.

[01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:46.100]
What's the lineman cello?

[01:40:46.900 --> 01:40:47.480]
I'm sorry?

[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:50.200]
It's some kind of a drink that we're going to give me.

[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:51.000]
Green lizards.

[01:40:51.100 --> 01:40:51.560]
Whatever, hello.

[01:40:51.780 --> 01:40:53.000]
What do I know about booze?

[01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:53.940]
What's that, Josh?

[01:40:53.940 --> 01:40:55.720]
You ought to be up here, Ali.

[01:40:56.080 --> 01:40:57.080]
I have no idea.

[01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:01.140]
I heard he said about the incident in LaCourie apparently quacked while if it's attacked

[01:41:01.140 --> 01:41:02.380]
in Slimen Chullos.

[01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:07.600]
But just two and a half hours earlier, DeVito was on Fox News channels, Fox and something

[01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:07.860]
rather.

[01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:10.200]
Have you been asleep yet Rosio Donald last him on the view?

[01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:11.640]
I don't know DeVito answered.

[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:12.080]
Not really.

[01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:13.300]
I'm going to wait a while and go to sleep.

[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:15.100]
Then the conversation turned to the White House.

[01:41:15.660 --> 01:41:20.000]
Earlier in the show, Coast Elizabeth Hasselbeck said that she'd been invited to meet President Bush,

[01:41:20.140 --> 01:41:21.340]
she offered her being O'Donnell's or guest.

[01:41:21.340 --> 01:41:23.500]
I don't know if they would want me to go, Donald said.

[01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:26.300]
Big left wing dite like that.

[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:29.420]
Those back influences, that's the way to go and disguise DeVito said.

[01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:30.160]
You know what I mean?

[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:31.340]
It's really, really a cool place.

[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:32.220]
They built it really well.

[01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:34.020]
He says the audience tittered nervously.

[01:41:34.460 --> 01:41:37.000]
And there I was during Clinton's last day, which was really nice DeVito said.

[01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:38.900]
The place had that kind of Clinton feeling, you know.

[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:42.880]
I didn't go to the White House after you know, NUMNUTs DeVito said, alluding to President Bush.

[01:41:43.660 --> 01:41:45.740]
ABC Sencers bleak the phrase NUMNUTS.

[01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:48.540]
But it was clear from reading DeVito's lips, that's what he said.

[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:49.560]
NUMNUTS.

[01:41:49.620 --> 01:41:50.180]
Oh, sorry, Joyce.

[01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:53.840]
You're waking up aren't you, I still enjoy being a B-HAR, what's your name?

[01:41:54.460 --> 01:41:54.980]
Joy B-HAR.

[01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:55.960]
B-What?

[01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:56.800]
B-HAR.

[01:41:56.840 --> 01:42:00.560]
Peter then mocked the President outgoing defense secretary, Rumshtol with goofy facial expressions.

[01:42:00.980 --> 01:42:05.480]
He talked out of the side of his mouth at one point, repeatedly banged his fist on his chin, three stooges style.

[01:42:05.820 --> 01:42:06.980]
Oh, I think he was talking about mouth.

[01:42:08.140 --> 01:42:09.440]
What is going on?

[01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:15.080]
Trying to figure out what to do with our country and our women and men in the military, DeVito said, Donald, Donald, OK, what about that hat trick last week?

[01:42:15.380 --> 01:42:16.320]
Rumshtol, the House and Senate.

[01:42:16.500 --> 01:42:16.740]
Ta-da!

[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:21.420]
He stood in the conversation toward his stay in the White House's Lincoln bedroom with his wife, actress Rhea Proman.

[01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:25.480]
I slept in the Lincoln bedroom with Rhea, he said, we went in and we made it our business to really direct the joint.

[01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:29.660]
I mean, every place in that bedroom was utilized, or Donald said, utilized DeVito's scent.

[01:42:29.860 --> 01:42:33.920]
You realize, in other words, they screwed their brains out on every piece of furniture, on the ceiling, on the wall, etc.

[01:42:34.220 --> 01:42:34.840]
Good for them.

[01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:39.820]
DeVito finished the segment by talking about his new movie, not his condition, but or Donald didn't let the issue go.

[01:42:40.540 --> 01:42:44.960]
When the nice guest criminal mind-star Thomas Gibson walked out, she kissed him and said, nice to see your sober.

[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:46.600]
It's nice to be sober, he said.

[01:42:47.100 --> 01:42:52.760]
DeVito will speak privately to view Denmark and Barbara Walters be forming any kind of a statement as fellow system Rosenfeld told the New York Post.

[01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:57.940]
Rosenfeld also represents the also equally integrated, highly-operated George Clooney.

[01:42:58.380 --> 01:42:59.120]
Who makes me nauseous?

[01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:01.500]
If you didn't see Seriana, don't see it.

[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:02.300]
No waste of time.

[01:43:02.420 --> 01:43:02.940]
No waste of money.

[01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:04.580]
There's nothing to see.

[01:43:04.740 --> 01:43:06.760]
You know, I mean, he had a thing in a lot of other flicks.

[01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:11.260]
George Clooney didn't see in anything, like hopefully in jail somewhere, from personning a director.

[01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:13.020]
I mean, that's such a piece of garbage.

[01:43:13.180 --> 01:43:15.400]
What was the other really bad movie he made that I was just screaming about?

[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:16.400]
George Clooney?

[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:16.960]
Yeah.

[01:43:17.460 --> 01:43:17.940]
The old boy.

[01:43:17.940 --> 01:43:18.720]
There was another one.

[01:43:19.300 --> 01:43:19.960]
But Seriana.

[01:43:20.420 --> 01:43:21.080]
Oh, God.

[01:43:21.180 --> 01:43:21.880]
I'll get back to you.

[01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:22.320]
Oh, Seriana.

[01:43:22.500 --> 01:43:23.080]
Good night and good luck.

[01:43:24.740 --> 01:43:25.240]
Hey, man.

[01:43:25.700 --> 01:43:27.280]
Edward Armoro is turning over in his rap.

[01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:29.800]
He is, he is chain-smoking camels in his rap.

[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:31.840]
He's so pissed off about how bad that movie is.

[01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:33.280]
And it was so highly touted.

[01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:36.100]
Now, that makes me very reluctant to go see Bobby, you know.

[01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:37.200]
And who's the one?

[01:43:37.300 --> 01:43:39.800]
Oh, Emilio, as the bird used to say, Esther Vez.

[01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:42.940]
He's the one that can talk to this thing, isn't he?

[01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:44.320]
Emilio, Esther Vez, Bobby?

[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:45.180]
Okay.

[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:46.220]
Yes, he did.

[01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:46.940]
Well, there's the phone.

[01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:47.700]
It must be my package.

[01:43:47.980 --> 01:43:48.400]
Play music.

[01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:15.340]
Wow, boys and girls.

[01:44:17.980 --> 01:44:20.620]
See, now I gotta go down and say that the guy is schlepping it up here again.

[01:44:20.740 --> 01:44:21.840]
This is where we're gonna kill more time.

[01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:24.240]
Now I gotta go downstairs, pay the guy to get the money, et cetera.

[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:25.040]
Really?

[01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:25.960]
So, kill some time.

[01:44:26.340 --> 01:44:26.540]
All right.

[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:35.820]
And interrupted my reading of this technical manual from my new computer over here.

[01:44:37.140 --> 01:44:38.760]
Hp's the devil by the way.

[01:44:40.580 --> 01:44:42.460]
What's gonna tell you to play that cramer, can't play?

[01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:44.920]
Dude.

[01:44:46.500 --> 01:44:47.260]
What a good idea.

[01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:49.340]
And then he could go, huh?

[01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:51.700]
Well, the better news is he's coming up, so I'll be around.

[01:44:51.700 --> 01:44:52.140]
Oh, all right.

[01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:53.520]
I'll be around.

[01:44:54.020 --> 01:44:54.860]
Plank, I'll be around.

[01:44:55.900 --> 01:44:56.720]
Oh, you wanna hear more?

[01:44:56.900 --> 01:44:57.460]
But not yet.

[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:00.160]
I didn't know.

[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:02.240]
I should see where dancing to this here.

[01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:05.360]
I get to lead.

[01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:15.300]
You know, people wish that they lived in other periods, you know.

[01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:16.000]
Really do that.

[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:16.680]
And stuff like that.

[01:45:16.780 --> 01:45:17.500]
Yeah, a lot of times.

[01:45:18.060 --> 01:45:21.000]
You know, fun times like when you could rape at will, you know.

[01:45:21.100 --> 01:45:23.580]
It was carrying a sword, rape anybody wanted those kind of days.

[01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:25.620]
Oh, and I know this was a vocal.

[01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:27.080]
I've some joy of this.

[01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:28.660]
And what year are we talking about right now?

[01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:30.580]
This is 30s.

[01:45:31.540 --> 01:45:34.580]
Vocal Brian gave me a double disc set called, about 30s.

[01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:36.180]
Man, get it?

[01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:36.820]
Get it?

[01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:38.300]
Guess what it's from.

[01:45:40.180 --> 01:45:43.620]
He was inspired by all that Edison music I was playing when we were doing the show.

[01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:46.560]
So he gave me a whole bunch of stuff.

[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:49.860]
And remember the old cartoons that you used to watch when you were a little kid?

[01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:52.120]
This is like all the background music came from this.

[01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:54.820]
Which at least they found something to do with that.

[01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:55.760]
This is tough.

[01:45:57.400 --> 01:46:01.260]
Now you don't, like, your dad's like a normal dad stepdad.

[01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:02.600]
They're normal human age people.

[01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:03.680]
You weren't raised by his family.

[01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:04.700]
He's still like up here yet.

[01:46:05.740 --> 01:46:06.620]
Sorry about that dad.

[01:46:06.780 --> 01:46:08.600]
So just played a break in no question.

[01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:10.640]
Whatever you want to do to break.

[01:46:11.580 --> 01:46:12.860]
Okay, I don't get a exit or anything.

[01:46:13.220 --> 01:46:13.480]
Come on.

[01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:14.440]
Fire off a cute boy.

[01:46:14.540 --> 01:46:16.140]
I'm not going to fire off you right now.

[01:46:16.140 --> 01:46:17.580]
You want to do the break while in that case.

[01:46:17.580 --> 01:46:21.280]
The biggest name of the best talent in the thesis.

[01:46:21.620 --> 01:46:25.640]
The O'Rodgers, the fourth radio, 560 U.A.M.

[01:46:27.540 --> 01:46:29.520]
Origins, dumb as dirt.

[01:46:30.020 --> 01:46:35.700]
Do you, Tom Cruise, take this former party of five cast member to have into hole?

[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:38.840]
Actually, I was on Dawson's Creek.

[01:46:38.860 --> 01:46:39.480]
Whatever.

[01:46:40.140 --> 01:46:43.280]
This whole wedding is just an exercise and shame was self-promotion anyway.

[01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:44.040]
I do.

[01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:49.560]
And do you, Katie Holmes, take this closeted action star to be your lovely wedding husband

[01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:51.700]
till irreconcilable differences?

[01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:52.760]
Do you park?

[01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:54.820]
At this point, do I really have a choice?

[01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:57.960]
Then by the power vested in me by El Ron Hubbard,

[01:46:58.340 --> 01:47:01.120]
I now pronounce you fake man and wife.

[01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:03.020]
You may now pretend to kiss the bride.

[01:47:08.540 --> 01:47:11.840]
This pair of 30 and 560 WPM got my package.

[01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:12.640]
What a day.

[01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:13.580]
What a day.

[01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:16.620]
I don't have to sit on pins and needles waiting for the door to pound.

[01:47:17.820 --> 01:47:20.360]
Canadian delivery guy, like older, really ugly guy.

[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:23.780]
But nevertheless, nice guy, very polite, very efficient.

[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:26.420]
Shlup the package right up here, my fax machine.

[01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:29.180]
65 out and 55 out of you like that.

[01:47:29.300 --> 01:47:30.000]
What a rip off.

[01:47:30.300 --> 01:47:32.460]
I'll tell you one thing, it saved me 100 bucks as a, you know,

[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:38.480]
if I would have missed a whole bunch of delivery and had to drive up to the UPS building way, way, way up in the end of the world.

[01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:40.460]
Remember that time I had to do that for my blackberry?

[01:47:40.460 --> 01:47:40.920]
That's right.

[01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:41.920]
Wow.

[01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:43.440]
That was a trip from hell.

[01:47:43.460 --> 01:47:45.300]
I thought we were going like to the North Pole that day.

[01:47:45.540 --> 01:47:46.040]
Pretty close.

[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:48.820]
U.S. band sale of iPods North 3.

[01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:50.080]
Did I just mention my blackberry?

[01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:51.780]
And here we are with a story about iPods.

[01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:52.320]
I like that.

[01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:53.480]
Got nothing to do with it.

[01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:57.100]
The Bush administration wants North 3 as attention so like a scolding parent,

[01:47:57.100 --> 01:48:01.100]
it's trying to make a tougher for that country's eccentric leaders to buy iPods.

[01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:02.560]
What if they're talking about Kim Jong-il?

[01:48:02.860 --> 01:48:03.600]
Yeah, that'll hurt them.

[01:48:03.980 --> 01:48:04.220]
Yeah.

[01:48:04.620 --> 01:48:05.380]
And I want Baldwin.

[01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:09.280]
They're making a tougher for that country's eccentric leader to buy iPods,

[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:11.440]
plasma TVs, and segue electric scooters.

[01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:13.560]
Well, how can we go on if we can't have our segways?

[01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:14.240]
Oh, boy.

[01:48:14.340 --> 01:48:15.940]
Have you ever seen anybody on a segway?

[01:48:16.180 --> 01:48:16.380]
Sure.

[01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:18.340]
We've had one for a toy for a while.

[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:19.320]
I mean, not at the house.

[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:20.980]
I mean, they made me wear a veilable.

[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:21.640]
We're here.

[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:24.620]
Here at the station they made one available and I was able to ride it around.

[01:48:24.980 --> 01:48:25.860]
In fact, we've squashed it.

[01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:26.460]
Oh.

[01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:27.760]
You think I was going to let him on it?

[01:48:28.220 --> 01:48:29.640]
The U.S. government's first ever ever teams.

[01:48:31.020 --> 01:48:36.360]
The U.S. government's first ever ever to use trade sanctions could personally aggravate a foreign president

[01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:40.100]
and expressly targets that it believed to be favored by Kim Jong-il and Iwak Baldwin,

[01:48:40.500 --> 01:48:45.240]
or Matt Damon, or presented by him as a gift to the roughly 600 loyalist families who run the communist government.

[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:50.400]
You'll be very dismayed, by the way, and you better straighten your buddy Miguel out since you were running alongside all the good movies.

[01:48:50.780 --> 01:48:54.520]
When he was on there filling in for you last week, even one of the day when he didn't know he was supposed to be working.

[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:58.400]
And we got in with conversation about a team of America world police.

[01:48:58.700 --> 01:48:59.440]
He hasn't seen it.

[01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:00.400]
Oh, my goodness.

[01:49:00.860 --> 01:49:02.320]
And he said, oh, you mean the one with the puppets?

[01:49:02.700 --> 01:49:03.180]
Remember that, John?

[01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:04.040]
Yeah, no, we will.

[01:49:04.540 --> 01:49:05.360]
Yeah, he's hurting.

[01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:08.760]
I didn't know that. We'll have to remedy that ASAP.

[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:16.420]
How can a guy who is supposedly a hipster like Miguel, somebody his age, in his, you know, realm, not know what they'll be talking about,

[01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:19.000]
team of America world police, one of the best movies of all time?

[01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:21.040]
Well, he's married now, so his life is over anyway.

[01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:21.920]
Oh, that's true.

[01:49:22.300 --> 01:49:23.700]
You hear that, Josh? Trust me.

[01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:26.500]
I don't even let it be a lesson to you and my other newfound friend.

[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:29.800]
Although evidently, he's this smart enough. He ain't getting that. And neither are you.

[01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:34.840]
Kim Hoijen needed a secret nuclear weapons program, his other options for obtaining the high-end consumer electronics on the right of him.

[01:49:34.940 --> 01:49:38.440]
He wants, but the listed proposed luxury sanctions obtained by the associated press,

[01:49:38.900 --> 01:49:45.060]
aims to make Kim a swanky life a lot harder, no more cognac, no more Rolex watches, no more cigarettes, no more faggots,

[01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:50.400]
artwork, expensive cars, Harley Davidson motorcycles, or even personal watercraft like jet skis.

[01:49:50.940 --> 01:49:56.460]
The new bandwreth, standing in the musical instruments and sports equipment, the 5.3 Kim is an enthusiastic basketball fan.

[01:49:56.460 --> 01:49:59.840]
Oh, yeah, he must play on stilts.

[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:05.800]
Then Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright presented him with a ball signed by Michael Jordan during a red diplomatic trip in 2000.

[01:50:06.660 --> 01:50:13.340]
Albright, he kissed Michael Jordan's ball. Kim's former secretary widely believed to be his new wife, studied piano with the Pyongyang University of Music and Dance.

[01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:20.720]
Experts said the sanctions ever been coordinated under the UN would be the first ever to curtail a specific category of goods,

[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:25.320]
not associated with military bills of her weapon designs, especially one so tailored to an Oya Fourn leader.

[01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:28.880]
US officials acknowledged that enforcing the band on black market trading would be difficult.

[01:50:29.340 --> 01:50:35.820]
In Beijing yesterday, US and North Korean on voice failed to reach an agreement on when to resume six party discernment negotiations on Kim's atomic weapons program,

[01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:46.180]
Japanese Kyoto news agency said it unidentified people at the talks as saying that Kim demanded the US free sanctions on luxury goods, other items imposed after North Korea's first nuclear test on October 9.

[01:50:46.660 --> 01:50:51.140]
The population, of course, in North Korea's impoverished and routinely suffers wide-scale food shortages.

[01:50:51.620 --> 01:50:56.000]
The new trade ban would forbid US shipments there of Rolexes, French Konyak, plasma TVs, yachts, and more.

[01:50:56.300 --> 01:50:59.180]
Autons favored by Kim, but untainable by the shluppers who live there.

[01:50:59.420 --> 01:51:05.080]
Well, that's not the way it is in most countries, huh? The dictators, the big shots, they get all the crap and everybody else feel like a bunch of shluppers.

[01:51:05.800 --> 01:51:06.180]
Unrealistic.

[01:51:06.460 --> 01:51:09.760]
That's right. That's exactly correct. She's showing Bush on her and saying unrealistic.

[01:51:10.180 --> 01:51:15.420]
I think that's a good word to describe him. Unrealistic and also unacceptable to describe the Bushmaster.

[01:51:15.420 --> 01:51:18.040]
Unacceptable, Georgie. When a doubt gets out of the house.

[01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:24.080]
Oh my god, we got two more years and almost two than years, because it's only the end of November.

[01:51:24.940 --> 01:51:27.200]
A lot of paint that the November day.

[01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:29.300]
How come I can't say that better than that?

[01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:32.940]
Well, you can't say it at all, so why do I have to apologize? Not to me.

[01:51:33.480 --> 01:51:40.000]
Once we start doing a show in bilingual baby, bilingual and bisexual, then we're going to take off like a rocket ship, like a rocket man.

[01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:43.020]
What was it? A captain of Cody. Commander Cody.

[01:51:43.020 --> 01:51:45.780]
Commander Cody in the, I wonder if it went in the Temple of Doom.

[01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:47.800]
Now what was the name of that movie series?

[01:51:48.340 --> 01:51:52.400]
Oh, and they're both the rocket man. He was rocket man, baby.

[01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:53.680]
I'm telling you, they had that one day.

[01:51:54.140 --> 01:51:54.240]
Huh?

[01:51:55.100 --> 01:51:59.200]
Maybe I'll find it on here. I'm the movie, you'll want to know on a silver thing.

[01:51:59.700 --> 01:51:59.960]
Silver chance.

[01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:11.540]
This is, uh, Disney Heights and Darling Hearts would chest your conquim

[01:52:11.540 --> 01:52:12.700]
one of the keystone comps.

[01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:17.780]
Wow. Well, it fits right in with the Al Jolson crack you were playing before.

[01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:21.540]
It's an old show for old people with an old host and George is getting ordered by the men.

[01:52:22.160 --> 01:52:22.900]
And that's the way we like it?

[01:52:23.220 --> 01:52:23.380]
Sure.

[01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:26.780]
All the oldies all the time. It was good enough for Rick Shaw for a hundred years on the air.

[01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:29.020]
It's good enough to keep us going for at least another week or two.

[01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:31.200]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:52:31.740 --> 01:52:35.920]
Tom 5, 60. Here's the fourth day of the calls being back and it's like, yeah, you know, slim and grim.

[01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:37.960]
A little bit action over here. A little bit over there.

[01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:39.460]
Not too heavy duty, you know.

[01:52:39.460 --> 01:52:41.960]
In fact, I think the novelies already worn off, don't you?

[01:52:42.660 --> 01:52:43.060]
Off of what?

[01:52:44.760 --> 01:52:48.440]
Then the bloom is off the rose, rose. WQA M Hello.

[01:52:49.380 --> 01:52:50.960]
You have more rooms, uh, maybe.

[01:52:51.780 --> 01:52:53.400]
Last one WQA M Hello.

[01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:55.920]
Hello, I'm Yolka Moury.

[01:52:56.320 --> 01:52:56.660]
Yes, sir.

[01:52:56.940 --> 01:53:01.360]
Hey, Neil, listen. I saw a match for it long before you started pitching it.

[01:53:01.660 --> 01:53:03.340]
But let me ask you something. What do you think?

[01:53:03.700 --> 01:53:07.820]
How did they put together that the ring they found in the second cell house?

[01:53:07.820 --> 01:53:09.240]
Norman Chris Killed.

[01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:10.400]
How did they put together that ring?

[01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:12.620]
You're really moving for everybody else for crying out loud.

[01:53:12.820 --> 01:53:13.700]
I'm sorry about that.

[01:53:13.700 --> 01:53:16.820]
Get out of here. I'm trying to get rid of you when I just dumped the call.

[01:53:17.280 --> 01:53:17.480]
Good.

[01:53:17.640 --> 01:53:19.760]
He didn't say anything sub-roser or anything like that.

[01:53:19.900 --> 01:53:23.600]
He just, he just spoiled the end of a very good movie for you that we don't want to do.

[01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:24.440]
Am I right?

[01:53:24.860 --> 01:53:25.020]
Yeah.

[01:53:25.640 --> 01:53:27.980]
In addition, which have he stood too stupid to figure that out?

[01:53:28.040 --> 01:53:28.900]
You shouldn't have watched it in the first place.

[01:53:28.900 --> 01:53:30.880]
There was nothing confusing about that movie.

[01:53:30.900 --> 01:53:32.340]
There wasn't anything anymore confusing.

[01:53:32.360 --> 01:53:35.320]
Then sticking your finger in a deep dark hole, okay, pal?

[01:53:35.380 --> 01:53:36.900]
There was nothing confusing at all.

[01:53:36.900 --> 01:53:37.840]
Well, that can be confusing.

[01:53:37.960 --> 01:53:39.200]
Just pointed in and stick it.

[01:53:39.300 --> 01:53:39.640]
That's all.

[01:53:39.780 --> 01:53:41.520]
And wherever it winds up, just licking.

[01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:45.600]
Like that guy from Lethbridge, whatever the hell is story is, the goofball is eating all the guts.

[01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:47.080]
All that, the hangus.

[01:53:47.540 --> 01:53:47.760]
Oh.

[01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:49.940]
1245 votes on a pool.

[01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:51.320]
How's that the return out doing?

[01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:51.640]
Good.

[01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:52.900]
70 up to 5.7%.

[01:53:53.640 --> 01:53:54.040]
Excellent.

[01:53:54.520 --> 01:53:55.740]
See, they think that's like a shot.

[01:53:56.020 --> 01:53:57.160]
I think it is a great compliment.

[01:53:57.360 --> 01:53:57.840]
Return out.

[01:53:57.920 --> 01:53:58.820]
You didn't get lost.

[01:53:59.340 --> 01:53:59.680]
Retire.

[01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:01.320]
WQIAM.

[01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:01.720]
Hello.

[01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:03.880]
Hello.

[01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:05.400]
Okay.

[01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:06.640]
Good talking to you too, schmuck.

[01:54:07.480 --> 01:54:07.800]
WQIAM.

[01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:08.000]
Hello.

[01:54:08.320 --> 01:54:08.820]
Hey Neil.

[01:54:09.260 --> 01:54:09.580]
Yes sir.

[01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:13.640]
Hey well, you know, you make one of your listeners happy if you die on the air because I mean,

[01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:15.440]
do you die and answer your funeral?

[01:54:15.980 --> 01:54:16.200]
Yeah.

[01:54:16.600 --> 01:54:17.380]
Oh, that guy, that's great.

[01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:19.340]
It'll be a, it'll be a, uh, quinoa, right?

[01:54:19.980 --> 01:54:20.320]
Uh-huh.

[01:54:21.940 --> 01:54:23.140]
I'm going to be creamed, baby.

[01:54:23.260 --> 01:54:24.080]
There ain't going to be no funeral.

[01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:25.120]
They're going to like burn my ashes.

[01:54:25.300 --> 01:54:27.720]
And then they can like mix them with my two dogs ashes, you know?

[01:54:28.300 --> 01:54:29.140]
That quite a cocktail.

[01:54:29.540 --> 01:54:30.360]
And they can throw them right there.

[01:54:30.420 --> 01:54:30.940]
It's a finished line.

[01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:31.500]
It would bind them.

[01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:34.200]
Or they can sprinkle them on my favorite machine, mine.

[01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:34.860]
A good machine.

[01:54:35.260 --> 01:54:38.680]
They can shake, they can, uh, smear some gold dust on a good machine.

[01:54:38.940 --> 01:54:40.600]
Do they allow smoking in there?

[01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:41.460]
No, they do not.

[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:41.820]
I see.

[01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:43.760]
No, they do absolutely not.

[01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:45.980]
It's too bad because then they could afford you into an astray right there.

[01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:48.480]
Into an astray, is that what people are going to be trying to do?

[01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:49.480]
Into an astray.

[01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:52.160]
Where else would you pour some fat old ass into an astray, baby?

[01:54:52.420 --> 01:54:52.420]

[01:54:53.340 --> 01:54:54.720]
That's where our foreign, your ass joins.

[01:54:54.940 --> 01:54:56.980]
Although I don't think we can find an astray big enough for it.

[01:54:57.440 --> 01:54:58.540]
You hate full cell.

[01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:00.620]
But let's not go back there again, okay?

[01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:02.740]
Because I think we got her put in her place for the time being.

[01:55:02.740 --> 01:55:03.900]
We got her ass come down.

[01:55:04.620 --> 01:55:06.660]
Hateful, nasty, wicked, evil witch.

[01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:08.980]
22 to 1 at 560 W.

[01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:11.460]
Who have no forgiveness for the mad dog, two to four this afternoon.

[01:55:11.460 --> 01:55:12.940]
And then the Humper is going to come along.

[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:14.660]
He's out there doing calisthenics right now.

[01:55:14.820 --> 01:55:15.740]
He's running up and down 441.

[01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:19.620]
And probably making a few pit stops like at Kentucky Fried.

[01:55:20.120 --> 01:55:20.740]
Places like that.

[01:55:21.540 --> 01:55:21.900]
Subcenter.

[01:55:22.260 --> 01:55:23.760]
How you doing Chuck over there at the subcenter?

[01:55:24.020 --> 01:55:25.720]
You think they listen over there on the corner across the street?

[01:55:26.060 --> 01:55:27.220]
I see them almost every morning though.

[01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:27.880]
You do?

[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:28.420]
You see Chuck?

[01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:29.520]
I'm making the turn.

[01:55:29.700 --> 01:55:30.400]
He's outside.

[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:34.440]
He's waiting for me because he recognized me in my beautiful Corvette.

[01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:35.940]
He probably doesn't recognize you.

[01:55:36.060 --> 01:55:37.780]
No, he's not even looking in that direction.

[01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:38.560]
But why not?

[01:55:39.020 --> 01:55:41.900]
Because he's over on the other corner doing stuff with the store.

[01:55:42.380 --> 01:55:42.860]
He's working?

[01:55:43.260 --> 01:55:43.760]
I am acting.

[01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:48.380]
Oh, it's supposed to are some of our former salespeople who are busy or cranking and showing them in disguise working.

[01:55:48.380 --> 01:55:49.200]
Yeah, they're working hours.

[01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:50.200]
Oh, like a real person.

[01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:54.680]
Hey, racing and poker fans, pompe-to-park racing and poker's got all the gambling action you want.

[01:55:54.840 --> 01:56:00.140]

[01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:09.940]
And now, pompe-to-park has added Mondays to its live racing and poker schedule.

[01:56:10.240 --> 01:56:12.540]
So let me set on our high payoffs four nights a week.

[01:56:13.020 --> 01:56:15.840]
Pompato Park features free admission and free general parking every day.

[01:56:16.180 --> 01:56:20.420]
And now live harness racing in the poker room or whenever Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.

[01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:25.120]
Poker gets underway noon and the live racing gets underway nightly, 7th, 25th and a PM.

[01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:26.600]
Don't forget every Wednesday night.

[01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:28.900]
It's down to night for draft beer soda hot dogs and lots more.

[01:56:28.900 --> 01:56:33.620]
And every live racing that you can enjoy our primary buffet on the fourth floor for just 9.95.

[01:56:33.820 --> 01:56:35.900]
But showing us your power player reward card.

[01:56:36.220 --> 01:56:40.540]
Don't have a power player reward card then set up for free at the Park Place gift shop at the Grand Stand inference.

[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:44.040]
You can earn great rewards for betting on a races or playing poker in its free-to-join.

[01:56:44.500 --> 01:56:49.720]
Pompato Park is also of course open every day for you seven days a nights a week with cymbal casting the best in harness.

[01:56:50.100 --> 01:56:53.560]
Throw a bread high on action from all across North America, feed a watch and wade you on.

[01:56:53.660 --> 01:56:58.460]
Plunge your lungs, baby. Look out for a breadcramer on the far outside. Hit him again, Brad. Up in a year.

[01:56:58.460 --> 01:57:03.860]
Pompato Park is a block south Atlantic Boulevard on Powerline Road for the new racing schedule called 9.5.4.

[01:57:04.540 --> 01:57:08.740]
972.2000 or on the Wicked Web it's Pompato Park dot com.

[01:57:08.780 --> 01:57:14.920]
The biggest name of the best talent to do this is wheel rogers for radio 560.

[01:57:15.420 --> 01:57:16.020]
UAM.

[01:57:17.740 --> 01:57:19.920]
Suck it in and hold it.

[01:57:19.980 --> 01:57:22.740]
The federal government just learned about those people today.

[01:57:22.740 --> 01:57:31.420]
On your wood-owing citizens and from both parties Brown offered no apology and mostly bring others for the debauchers that cost hundreds of runs.

[01:57:31.460 --> 01:57:32.200]
Mike Brown.

[01:57:32.780 --> 01:57:35.900]
There's no one left to blame I said Brownie.

[01:57:36.340 --> 01:57:39.780]
You're the government shame I said Brownie.

[01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:43.220]
The short careers up in blame there's no one.

[01:57:43.780 --> 01:57:47.360]
I know who's more late in George Bush.

[01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:54.920]
We better make them shut up before he says it was you who messed up you can defend him.

[01:57:55.200 --> 01:58:01.860]
But I'm sure you will find many think that he should do time.

[01:58:02.020 --> 01:58:03.880]
I was entirely exposed.

[01:58:04.260 --> 01:58:06.380]
This way to dumb to run the air.

[01:58:06.740 --> 01:58:10.120]
Fee and eight some people died when he ran air.

[01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:11.600]
Fee and eight.

[01:58:11.980 --> 01:58:12.380]
Absolutely.

[01:58:12.380 --> 01:58:19.540]
Now that everyone knows that you leadership votes you can go back to your part shows today.

[01:58:19.720 --> 01:58:24.480]
Both Republicans and Democrats criticize the fact that Brown is still on the federal payroll.

[01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:29.080]
That maybe because as long as he remains an administration official his testimony.

[01:58:29.080 --> 01:58:32.760]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but it'll be pretty much about plus 45 at 560 every year.

[01:58:32.860 --> 01:58:41.540]
There's also some goofy thing in my space about the mole and Moe is on with who we got Lamar Thomas is at his own Monday with our sports overdriven morning show.

[01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:42.560]
Dolphins Monday.

[01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:43.520]
Yeah, that's Lamar Thomas.

[01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:43.960]
Lamar Thomas.

[01:58:44.100 --> 01:58:44.520]
Keep up.

[01:58:45.780 --> 01:58:46.420]
Tarell Buckley.

[01:58:46.800 --> 01:58:48.520]
Yeah, I know who Tarell Buckley is.

[01:58:48.920 --> 01:58:50.660]
He was a pretty weak when he played with it.

[01:58:50.740 --> 01:58:51.720]
Who else did he play for?

[01:58:51.760 --> 01:58:53.480]
He was pretty good for somebody else and he sucked with it.

[01:58:53.720 --> 01:58:55.320]
But at any rate your Patriot.

[01:58:55.800 --> 01:58:58.520]
That's right. Tarell Buckley was with the pay. Who else was with the Thai law?

[01:58:59.140 --> 01:58:59.920]
And what's his name?

[01:59:00.040 --> 01:59:01.100]
All these guys that we don't have anymore.

[01:59:01.180 --> 01:59:01.860]
And they're still kicking ass.

[01:59:02.200 --> 01:59:03.800]
Now let's see the Patriots and Alliance this week.

[01:59:03.920 --> 01:59:04.940]
It's a girls team or plan.

[01:59:05.380 --> 01:59:05.820]
Where's that game?

[01:59:05.900 --> 01:59:07.660]
Is that a game in Foxboro?

[01:59:07.800 --> 01:59:08.020]
I believe.

[01:59:08.380 --> 01:59:09.020]
He told anybody.

[01:59:09.020 --> 01:59:10.440]
It's actually a stadium man.

[01:59:10.740 --> 01:59:11.080]
Detroit.

[01:59:11.480 --> 01:59:12.100]
I think I don't know.

[01:59:12.320 --> 01:59:12.900]
Does it make a difference?

[01:59:13.060 --> 01:59:13.500]
Of course not.

[01:59:13.880 --> 01:59:17.620]
And the Dolphins have a home game in Spiderman, which Alliance was building yesterday.

[01:59:17.840 --> 01:59:20.180]
They got a home game against the Jacksonville J. U.R.s.

[01:59:20.340 --> 01:59:21.860]
Who are very mysterious, man.

[01:59:21.940 --> 01:59:22.800]
One week they're really good.

[01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:23.800]
The next week they suck.

[01:59:24.140 --> 01:59:25.400]
And then it's like most of the NFL.

[01:59:25.820 --> 01:59:26.500]
It's mediocrity.

[01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:29.440]
You know they got parody, which means mostly mediocre teams.

[01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:31.500]
And then of course the Dolphins who really suck.

[01:59:31.620 --> 01:59:32.700]
But they got four in a row, baby.

[01:59:33.020 --> 01:59:35.220]
Yeah, you better jump on that Dolphin bandwagon.

[01:59:35.640 --> 01:59:36.420]
Start pushing it.

[01:59:36.660 --> 01:59:37.180]
No thanks.

[01:59:37.180 --> 01:59:40.400]
You push it like pushing the entire old push cart in New York.

[01:59:40.840 --> 01:59:43.160]
I think we'll all have to make a big trip to Europe to Amsterdam.

[01:59:43.340 --> 01:59:44.180]
Do the show from over there.

[01:59:44.480 --> 01:59:47.180]
And maybe we can get Bob Ramuth to go back and make an appearance there again too.

[01:59:47.260 --> 01:59:48.360]
They left him right out of town again.

[01:59:48.680 --> 01:59:49.420]
What a jackass.

[01:59:50.060 --> 01:59:53.060]
He just left the poor engineer over there to pour a Dutch guy.

[01:59:53.160 --> 01:59:55.180]
He just left him in the lurch and just got on a plane in Vamoost.

[01:59:56.040 --> 01:59:57.440]
Remember that call we tried to take that day?

[01:59:57.540 --> 01:59:58.120]
We had Rimmer calling?

[01:59:58.520 --> 01:59:59.340]
Of course that was a mistake.

[01:59:59.560 --> 01:59:59.960]
But remember that?

[02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:00.140]
Yeah.

[02:00:00.520 --> 02:00:02.500]
When I was trying to do the show for my studio in Amsterdam.

[02:00:02.980 --> 02:00:03.280]
Wow.

[02:00:03.820 --> 02:00:04.460]
It was kind of like.

[02:00:04.740 --> 02:00:05.740]
Hey, Diel, can you hear me?

[02:00:05.820 --> 02:00:05.980]
Hello.

[02:00:05.980 --> 02:00:07.760]
It was kind of like that only even better.

[02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:14.180]
From 169 votes on the poll, Rick Shaw has retiring a legend after 185 years in a business after,

[02:00:14.880 --> 02:00:17.200]
what, 46 years in Miami, I think since 1960.

[02:00:17.820 --> 02:00:20.120]
And Ricky Tiki announced on Tuesday and called us here on the show.

[02:00:20.220 --> 02:00:22.100]
If you missed that call, you missed really something.

[02:00:22.480 --> 02:00:23.140]
I could use it.

[02:00:23.340 --> 02:00:23.340]

[02:00:23.780 --> 02:00:24.360]
It was radio.

[02:00:24.380 --> 02:00:26.360]
It was like the day I don't want to say it.

[02:00:26.420 --> 02:00:28.260]
When I said it and I had that call, I was, I was sad.

[02:00:28.540 --> 02:00:28.960]
It was sad.

[02:00:29.280 --> 02:00:31.560]
The call was sad and the fact that he croaked is even sadder.

[02:00:31.580 --> 02:00:31.920]
But nevertheless.

[02:00:32.840 --> 02:00:35.260]
Now I tell you what the saddest thing is that he's still.

[02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:39.940]
He's still had that desire to hear from the audience at the end of every month on his blog.

[02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:41.060]
He would open it up for comments.

[02:00:41.260 --> 02:00:42.840]
He's still had that need, you know.

[02:00:43.040 --> 02:00:45.000]
And that was disturbing me.

[02:00:45.080 --> 02:00:45.680]
I don't want to say it.

[02:00:45.680 --> 02:00:48.720]
I didn't like Senator Mimeson saying, hey, cut the crap because it was his choice.

[02:00:48.840 --> 02:00:49.420]
It was his choice.

[02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:49.980]
Right.

[02:00:50.460 --> 02:00:53.520]
He knew what the kind of crap he was going to get and what kind of goofballs are out there.

[02:00:53.760 --> 02:00:55.740]
And on the one hand, you got the people kissing your ass.

[02:00:56.100 --> 02:00:57.800]
And on the other hand, wow, you got what you deserve.

[02:00:58.000 --> 02:00:58.580]
I hope you die.

[02:00:58.720 --> 02:00:59.100]
I'll look at it.

[02:00:59.240 --> 02:00:59.820]
You know, like that.

[02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:01.060]
That's what you got out there.

[02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:02.160]
Because it's Florida, baby.

[02:01:02.620 --> 02:01:06.360]
This guy, this UPS delivery guy that just came, I know it's a very minor thing.

[02:01:06.500 --> 02:01:07.780]
It's, you know, a sibling.

[02:01:08.180 --> 02:01:09.560]
But he was so freaking polite, man.

[02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:11.000]
You would have liked to put your guts out.

[02:01:11.220 --> 02:01:11.880]
Should have taped me.

[02:01:12.440 --> 02:01:12.820]
Kilted me.

[02:01:12.960 --> 02:01:13.220]
I like to put it in.

[02:01:13.420 --> 02:01:13.820]
You would have had to.

[02:01:13.820 --> 02:01:17.460]
Should have tipped him after having to pay $65 and $55 cents to custom tape.

[02:01:17.460 --> 02:01:18.220]
And a lot of them.

[02:01:18.380 --> 02:01:19.140]
I know what you said.

[02:01:19.340 --> 02:01:19.880]
I heard everything.

[02:01:20.340 --> 02:01:21.980]
I'm deaf or something for Christ's sake.

[02:01:22.300 --> 02:01:24.100]
Just because I'm old and feeble, I heard what you said.

[02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:24.840]
Taped this.

[02:01:25.220 --> 02:01:25.680]
Of course he did.

[02:01:26.120 --> 02:01:27.460]
Taped it right to your ****.

[02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:27.720]
Yeah.

[02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:28.680]
Scroed.

[02:01:28.900 --> 02:01:30.600]
From 71 votes.

[02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:31.600]
It throw it rhymes with scroed.

[02:01:32.220 --> 02:01:32.900]
Rick draws retiring.

[02:01:32.900 --> 02:01:33.860]
What you need to retire.

[02:01:34.220 --> 02:01:35.460]
Whatever the hell he even feels like.

[02:01:35.540 --> 02:01:37.620]
And that's $542.47.3%.

[02:01:37.620 --> 02:01:39.640]
That's obviously the only acceptable answer.

[02:01:40.180 --> 02:01:41.860]
Who the hell are you people to be telling me when to retire?

[02:01:42.060 --> 02:01:42.880]
Of course I asked the question.

[02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:44.020]
But it was just a kill month of days.

[02:01:44.160 --> 02:01:44.940]
What are you hell are you?

[02:01:45.380 --> 02:01:46.720]
And that's a couple of good polls here.

[02:01:46.780 --> 02:01:47.540]
What was that other one here?

[02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:50.020]
Oh, I got it over here in the basket.

[02:01:50.280 --> 02:01:50.880]
The one from Robbie.

[02:01:51.300 --> 02:01:52.180]
He says, I tried.

[02:01:52.300 --> 02:01:53.040]
No, I don't feel bad.

[02:01:53.160 --> 02:01:53.760]
Robbie, it's a good one.

[02:01:53.920 --> 02:01:54.300]
I like that.

[02:01:54.420 --> 02:01:54.780]
It's a good poll.

[02:01:55.160 --> 02:01:56.200]
And the other one doesn't have any money.

[02:01:56.600 --> 02:01:56.800]
No.

[02:01:56.940 --> 02:01:58.520]
Real men don't yaddy-addy-addy.

[02:01:58.520 --> 02:01:59.220]
That's a good one.

[02:01:59.780 --> 02:02:02.980]
So this, even if nothing else good happens, the next hour and eleven minutes has been a

[02:02:02.980 --> 02:02:06.200]
banner day for me, my standby fax machine showed up here.

[02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:10.020]
And the guy actually delivered it to my door in a big, big heavy duty bus.

[02:02:10.180 --> 02:02:11.680]
It's a good thing I'd have to slip that up here.

[02:02:11.920 --> 02:02:14.160]
Although, of course, we got these, you know, what do they call those things?

[02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:15.340]
What do they call them?

[02:02:15.460 --> 02:02:15.780]
Dullies.

[02:02:16.140 --> 02:02:18.040]
Ah, we got these Dullies, baby.

[02:02:18.220 --> 02:02:18.700]
Hand truck.

[02:02:19.340 --> 02:02:20.280]
Well, kind of like that.

[02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:21.220]
No, it's a Dullie.

[02:02:21.280 --> 02:02:22.100]
Not a hand truck.

[02:02:22.620 --> 02:02:23.500]
But whatever the hell they are.

[02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:25.200]
So anyway, he sluts it right to my door.

[02:02:25.320 --> 02:02:25.880]
So that happened.

[02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:26.620]
Get out of the way.

[02:02:26.620 --> 02:02:27.240]
A lot of stress.

[02:02:27.760 --> 02:02:30.520]
I've changed emails with them when I have very favorite people in the world, even though

[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:31.340]
he doesn't realize it yet.

[02:02:31.500 --> 02:02:32.020]
And I hope he doesn't.

[02:02:32.280 --> 02:02:32.940]
Anyway, whatever.

[02:02:33.840 --> 02:02:34.520]
Rich Shaws retiring.

[02:02:34.660 --> 02:02:35.320]
One should kneel retire.

[02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:38.280]
Whenever he feels like in 503, never 527.

[02:02:38.900 --> 02:02:39.760]
A very close second.

[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:40.580]
Never retire.

[02:02:40.720 --> 02:02:43.120]
Just keep going until they come up there and drag your ass out.

[02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:44.180]
And they ain't come out of here.

[02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:44.820]
I'll guarantee you that.

[02:02:45.100 --> 02:02:46.140]
I'll have him stop to the border.

[02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:47.900]
Any of these going from this company.

[02:02:48.460 --> 02:02:49.360]
Now, retire now.

[02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:49.720]
74.

[02:02:50.040 --> 02:02:51.340]
That's up to 5.8%.

[02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:52.240]
Retire!

[02:02:52.500 --> 02:02:52.660]
Now.

[02:02:53.060 --> 02:02:55.220]
And they're doing that just, you know, to stick it in there a little bit.

[02:02:55.340 --> 02:02:55.760]
Like I care.

[02:02:55.760 --> 02:02:58.500]
I wouldn't care if it was like 95% said, retire now.

[02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:01.340]
I'll retire when I'm good and ready when I got enough money to like I go to woodbine

[02:03:01.340 --> 02:03:01.780]
every day.

[02:03:02.100 --> 02:03:04.040]
And then travel all over the freaking world, you know.

[02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:07.580]
In a few years, 45 soon, 13, I hate this pool.

[02:03:07.820 --> 02:03:08.000]
11.

[02:03:08.400 --> 02:03:08.560]
Soon.

[02:03:08.980 --> 02:03:10.260]
Like, what does soon mean?

[02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:11.300]
I mean, I know I put it on there.

[02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:12.500]
This is strictly my poll.

[02:03:13.220 --> 02:03:13.840]
What does soon mean?

[02:03:13.940 --> 02:03:14.320]
I don't know.

[02:03:14.400 --> 02:03:14.960]
Like this weekend.

[02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:16.320]
No, that sounds like good.

[02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:17.280]
It sounds like a plan.

[02:03:17.540 --> 02:03:18.520]
A plan of action, man.

[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:19.920]
I don't think so.

[02:03:20.420 --> 02:03:21.260]
Santa Majority of the day.

[02:03:21.320 --> 02:03:24.620]
We had this for you first in the world yesterday because I seen it there on CNN, so they

[02:03:24.620 --> 02:03:26.260]
must have had a first thing by the day.

[02:03:26.460 --> 02:03:29.980]
There's that bushload of tick and there's Maliki, you know, they had a postponement until

[02:03:29.980 --> 02:03:31.840]
the day because they're trying to figure out what to do with it.

[02:03:32.380 --> 02:03:35.260]
Bonnie Satter, whatever her name is, and we're Bonnie Tyler.

[02:03:35.380 --> 02:03:36.580]
This is Bonnie Satter, her sister.

[02:03:37.340 --> 02:03:37.860]
That's a crap.

[02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:39.400]
All these schmata heads, baby.

[02:03:39.760 --> 02:03:40.760]
Schmata heads gone wild.

[02:03:40.900 --> 02:03:42.000]
You all got girls gone wild.

[02:03:42.300 --> 02:03:43.620]
This is schmata heads gone wild.

[02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:49.220]
And then there was actually somebody who was talking and this, this was most insane.

[02:03:49.880 --> 02:03:52.360]
One of the talking heads, there was only 6,000 of every day.

[02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:55.980]
They were going on about, well, if they put somebody back in power like Saddam Hussein,

[02:03:56.260 --> 02:03:57.880]
he just went through this bizarre trial.

[02:03:58.200 --> 02:04:02.040]
They're going to hang his ass and we went to, supposedly, all of this stuff was to get

[02:04:02.040 --> 02:04:05.940]
him out of there in the first place, regime change and reference to mass destruction and

[02:04:05.940 --> 02:04:09.720]
the fact that he was an evil doer in a threat to our society and the whole freaking world.

[02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:12.620]
Oh, well, maybe they have to put him back in there, which means, of course, they should

[02:04:12.620 --> 02:04:13.880]
let them alone in the first place.

[02:04:14.320 --> 02:04:15.740]
Anybody would have a brain knows that.

[02:04:16.060 --> 02:04:17.020]
He was our evil doer.

[02:04:17.500 --> 02:04:19.000]
But what is kind of a religious fanatic?

[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:22.220]
You need an evil doer and they're to keep him all in line, keep him from killing each

[02:04:22.220 --> 02:04:23.860]
other, from murder and mayhem.

[02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:26.460]
That's the problem with these freaking ragheads, man.

[02:04:26.780 --> 02:04:27.480]
They're out of control.

[02:04:27.960 --> 02:04:28.740]
Ragheads gone wild.

[02:04:28.860 --> 02:04:30.880]
I think the Pope had a point there when he came right down to it.

[02:04:31.080 --> 02:04:32.300]
Oh, gee, you can't say that.

[02:04:32.580 --> 02:04:33.860]
He had a point right at the tip of the show.

[02:04:33.980 --> 02:04:35.360]
Oh, he was right, but who's he to talk?

[02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:40.320]
Yeah, who now are you to be talking about religious fanatics killing other people, making

[02:04:40.320 --> 02:04:41.400]
him an offer they can't refuse?

[02:04:41.680 --> 02:04:42.400]
Who are you, Papa?

[02:04:42.660 --> 02:04:42.780]
Huh?

[02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:46.620]
I think we need an inquisition over there with a swish guard and you go in there and do

[02:04:46.620 --> 02:04:47.000]
what for.

[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:48.760]
Maybe give him a nasty cup of tea.

[02:04:49.080 --> 02:04:51.220]
Maybe the Russians need to come in there and show him, give him a little instruction

[02:04:51.220 --> 02:04:52.140]
out of poison people.

[02:04:52.500 --> 02:04:55.760]
They already poisoned one Pope not that long ago, but you're not supposed to talk about

[02:04:55.760 --> 02:04:55.900]
that.

[02:04:55.980 --> 02:04:57.380]
I just watched Godfather 3 instead.

[02:04:58.920 --> 02:05:00.400]
I know it's a heavy price to pay.

[02:05:00.520 --> 02:05:02.120]
I let you see where the bishop goes flying.

[02:05:02.560 --> 02:05:02.820]
Oh, yeah.

[02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:03.560]
The rest goes up in here.

[02:05:03.680 --> 02:05:03.940]
You see that?

[02:05:04.160 --> 02:05:07.620]
If you look at his foot, it's headed that movie so that all that, you know, he gets

[02:05:07.620 --> 02:05:10.400]
the preacher stuff and then edit all the rest of it out.

[02:05:10.420 --> 02:05:11.160]
A little time and wrath in there.

[02:05:12.420 --> 02:05:12.740]
Yeah.

[02:05:13.040 --> 02:05:14.060]
When he kept like that.

[02:05:14.180 --> 02:05:15.560]
Get rid of all that soapy of business.

[02:05:15.560 --> 02:05:15.920]
Yeah.

[02:05:16.100 --> 02:05:18.160]
That post-nasal grip syndrome.

[02:05:18.180 --> 02:05:19.100]
It's kind of a Jewish thing.

[02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:20.840]
Of course, he was very Jewish.

[02:05:22.180 --> 02:05:22.960]
It's a Jew thing.

[02:05:23.180 --> 02:05:24.020]
I didn't post-nasal grip.

[02:05:24.380 --> 02:05:27.560]
My uncle Heimann had that thing always like that.

[02:05:28.120 --> 02:05:29.440]
Good guy, but they quite drive you nuts.

[02:05:30.020 --> 02:05:30.260]
Hi.

[02:05:32.320 --> 02:05:35.200]
Senator Majority Leader Bill Friss said yesterday he won't run for president.

[02:05:35.340 --> 02:05:35.960]
We had that on the air.

[02:05:36.060 --> 02:05:39.300]
As it happened, is it announcing a man ran out of the box and everybody said, what?

[02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:41.800]
He will not run for president as if he had a chance.

[02:05:41.980 --> 02:05:42.140]
Of course.

[02:05:42.280 --> 02:05:45.140]
And of course this morning, who's the guy for Tom Bill sack for my own announce?

[02:05:45.140 --> 02:05:46.320]
He wants to be the president.

[02:05:46.940 --> 02:05:50.480]
You know, I want to be Ed McMahon and have 50 billion dollars in the bank too, but I'm

[02:05:50.480 --> 02:05:50.660]
not.

[02:05:50.900 --> 02:05:54.940]
He'll a high profile campaign drop up more than a year before the first convention delegates

[02:05:54.940 --> 02:05:55.480]
are chosen.

[02:05:55.700 --> 02:06:00.380]
In the Bible, he said, God tells us for everything there's a season and for me now, this

[02:06:00.380 --> 02:06:02.300]
season of being elected officials come to a close.

[02:06:02.480 --> 02:06:05.280]
He said, of course, he was a surgeon, people rendered politics in 1994.

[02:06:05.640 --> 02:06:09.360]
That's why he was able to diagnose Terry and her by watching her on TV, remember that?

[02:06:09.700 --> 02:06:11.520]
He said, all his balloons are moving.

[02:06:11.640 --> 02:06:13.440]
He must be breathing that bitch or something like that.

[02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:17.660]
He said he'll take us to medical from public life and return to his professional roots as

[02:06:17.660 --> 02:06:22.940]
a healer and to refocus his creative energies on innovative solutions to seemingly insurmountable

[02:06:22.940 --> 02:06:26.320]
challenges American face, which sounds like a lot of high fly and meaningless rhetoric

[02:06:26.320 --> 02:06:30.280]
like a bunch of political double talk, pop up up up, a BB like that crap, El Crapo.

[02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.980]
First announced when he first ran for the Senate and he retire after two terms.

[02:06:34.420 --> 02:06:34.760]
Retired!

[02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:35.240]
That's it.

[02:06:35.460 --> 02:06:37.380]
Let's take a poll on some other people when they should retire.

[02:06:37.640 --> 02:06:38.480]
Like George W. Bush.

[02:06:38.860 --> 02:06:39.100]
No!

[02:06:39.980 --> 02:06:41.640]
I bet you need to do better than that than I did.

[02:06:42.280 --> 02:06:45.480]
His decision not to seek the White House thus can't say 12-year-old Stint in Electoral

[02:06:45.480 --> 02:06:50.320]
Politics, which he rose from an underdog in his 1994, from an updog in 94 Senate campaign

[02:06:50.320 --> 02:06:52.700]
to be positioned in majority later or maybe eight years later.

[02:06:52.960 --> 02:06:54.640]
And of course, you own every election there's a dog.

[02:06:55.380 --> 02:06:58.260]
Among the Republicans already exploring White House, bed now we know about that.

[02:06:58.280 --> 02:06:59.220]
Why did they put this in here?

[02:06:59.300 --> 02:07:00.140]
Like, Robots had children.

[02:07:00.260 --> 02:07:01.560]
Okay, who now wrote this AP?

[02:07:01.980 --> 02:07:02.560]
David Espo.

[02:07:03.040 --> 02:07:03.240]
Good.

[02:07:03.480 --> 02:07:04.000]
God Almighty.

[02:07:04.720 --> 02:07:08.480]
Other potential GOP contenders include Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas.

[02:07:08.940 --> 02:07:09.440]
God forbid.

[02:07:09.740 --> 02:07:11.080]
Can you even begin to imagine that?

[02:07:11.500 --> 02:07:15.900]
Rather Sam Brownback who's got like a swastika on his forehead and Chuck Hagerland Nebraska.

[02:07:15.920 --> 02:07:17.140]
Chuck Hager's a pretty good guy.

[02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:18.000]
I'm a pretty moderate guy.

[02:07:18.040 --> 02:07:20.280]
Much too moderate to get the nomination just like Rudy Giuliani.

[02:07:20.780 --> 02:07:24.380]
Governor George Pataki of New York and Mike, former governor because he's on the way

[02:07:24.380 --> 02:07:26.100]
out because Elliott Spitzer is coming in.

[02:07:26.100 --> 02:07:30.000]
He's the man in Dark Horse and Mike Huckabee of Arkansas and representative Duncan

[02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:30.700]
on the California.

[02:07:30.800 --> 02:07:31.540]
I'm trying to you right now.

[02:07:31.660 --> 02:07:34.380]
A great ticket would be Barack Obama with Elliott Spitzer.

[02:07:34.720 --> 02:07:36.800]
A Schwarzenegger would never be good.

[02:07:37.060 --> 02:07:37.600]
Works for me.

[02:07:38.340 --> 02:07:40.180]
Boy, you talk about swimming off stream.

[02:07:40.180 --> 02:07:41.940]
But Democrats are good at doing that swimming upstream.

[02:07:42.120 --> 02:07:42.940]
I think that's the thing.

[02:07:43.020 --> 02:07:44.160]
I like Barack Obama a lot.

[02:07:44.220 --> 02:07:46.780]
I'm telling you right now, I think he's got a certain thing.

[02:07:46.960 --> 02:07:47.160]
You know what I mean?

[02:07:47.220 --> 02:07:48.980]
He's got like a, he's got charisma.

[02:07:49.240 --> 02:07:49.780]
Yeah, he does.

[02:07:50.060 --> 02:07:51.260]
Bob I had charisma, you know?

[02:07:51.380 --> 02:07:51.720]
That's right.

[02:07:51.820 --> 02:07:53.420]
Bush has got the charisma of a dead man.

[02:07:53.800 --> 02:07:55.960]
You can't complain about his charisma because he didn't have any.

[02:07:56.960 --> 02:07:59.340]
I mean, there's one thing that he's got that we all know about.

[02:07:59.400 --> 02:08:01.240]
Boy, does he have a lot of charisma?

[02:08:01.620 --> 02:08:02.320]
But no charisma.

[02:08:02.960 --> 02:08:06.020]
But Barack Obama has just got the, and of course you're saying, well, what does charisma

[02:08:06.020 --> 02:08:07.080]
have to do with the, you know?

[02:08:07.500 --> 02:08:09.100]
I mean, there's movie actors got charisma too.

[02:08:09.100 --> 02:08:10.120]
Well, how about Arnold?

[02:08:10.280 --> 02:08:11.060]
He's got that in our California.

[02:08:11.320 --> 02:08:12.560]
He shouldn't have anything to do with it.

[02:08:12.580 --> 02:08:13.440]
What else did he have going for?

[02:08:13.540 --> 02:08:15.300]
Except he's married to one of the arcandities, you know?

[02:08:16.060 --> 02:08:17.900]
By the way, you're going to go see Bobby, neither am I.

[02:08:18.160 --> 02:08:21.980]
I don't want to see some fiction about Bobby Kennedy that doesn't have anything to do

[02:08:21.980 --> 02:08:24.960]
with the reality about all the extra bullets that they found in the pantry, they're at the

[02:08:24.960 --> 02:08:28.300]
ambassador hotel, and about who we really killed him, and about the, you know, let's get

[02:08:28.300 --> 02:08:31.980]
a movie that tells us something about the truth for quite a lot instead of some romanticized

[02:08:31.980 --> 02:08:34.560]
BS because the media as to as his daddy is Martin Machine.

[02:08:34.780 --> 02:08:35.100]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:08:35.440 --> 02:08:36.460]
From the shitty Alps.

[02:08:36.460 --> 02:08:39.060]
I like Martin Machine, but you know enough with him already.

[02:08:39.520 --> 02:08:41.740]
Although I'd say you one good thing about Martin Machine, you know what that is?

[02:08:42.080 --> 02:08:42.400]
What's that?

[02:08:42.720 --> 02:08:43.580]
He's not sure it's cluming.

[02:08:43.680 --> 02:08:50.860]
The biggest name, the best talent to the thesis, Neil Rogers, Force Radio 560, SUAM.

[02:08:52.740 --> 02:08:59.440]
Just hate people that use snappy openers for their show segments like that one to two

[02:08:59.440 --> 02:08:59.820]
hour.

[02:09:00.440 --> 02:09:03.160]
Hello, this is Albert Kaita from Tallet Van Records,

[02:09:03.160 --> 02:09:06.800]
a fighting you American infidel to buy latest cat Stevens collection.

[02:09:06.940 --> 02:09:12.960]
You know my homie is right, take your head off your body, got a machete with the real

[02:09:12.960 --> 02:09:19.740]
sharp blade, how I wish I had an American hostage, make those in middle length.

[02:09:20.060 --> 02:09:21.480]
I was so intruding this classic.

[02:09:21.780 --> 02:09:31.120]
I was on the airplane, and suddenly was detained, their mac is I can bird, and where it's

[02:09:31.120 --> 02:09:32.300]
now on my head.

[02:09:32.500 --> 02:09:33.320]
I don't know, I don't know.

[02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:36.640]
I'm in followed by an F-16.

[02:09:37.180 --> 02:09:39.220]
What do they want with me?

[02:09:39.260 --> 02:09:42.480]
The money from your purchase does not go to funds terrorism, really.

[02:09:42.660 --> 02:09:45.620]
It's not time to get off the plane.

[02:09:46.840 --> 02:09:49.360]
Just relax and take it easy.

[02:09:50.060 --> 02:09:51.340]
You're just dumb.

[02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:53.000]
That's your fault.

[02:09:53.940 --> 02:09:56.600]
It wouldn't have been a fire or a Jew.

[02:09:56.600 --> 02:10:03.600]
Find dark skin and a rag if you want a detainee.

[02:10:04.600 --> 02:10:06.260]
I know the variation on a classic one.

[02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:12.620]
I ask myself every day which American should pay.

[02:10:13.560 --> 02:10:16.900]
Tell me who I knew how I'm slain.

[02:10:17.540 --> 02:10:18.600]
I'm going to shoot you in the middle of a gun.

[02:10:18.680 --> 02:10:21.020]
I'm coming to the neck of a woman.

[02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:28.200]
She lived her veil and exposed herself.

[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:31.620]
So buy New Catch Stevens collection today from 1995.

[02:10:32.120 --> 02:10:35.560]
Or you can pay with free time mastercard or weapons of master drugs.

[02:10:37.380 --> 02:10:38.960]
That's one of my old time favorites.

[02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:42.620]
Not because of the bit itself, but just because of that phony Muslim ranting.

[02:10:42.820 --> 02:10:44.140]
Which is all Indian man.

[02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:45.000]
It's all Indian.

[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:47.320]
I think whoever the announcer was there had too much curry.

[02:10:48.600 --> 02:10:49.700]
1305 on the pole.

[02:10:49.840 --> 02:10:50.520]
1300 plus.

[02:10:50.660 --> 02:10:52.620]
That's pretty damn good for an old apart like me.

[02:10:52.740 --> 02:10:53.340]
I'll tell you right now.

[02:10:53.480 --> 02:10:54.000]
We're plugging along.

[02:10:54.200 --> 02:10:56.120]
Speaking of people who run for president or won't.

[02:10:56.260 --> 02:10:57.040]
Guess who is?

[02:10:57.720 --> 02:10:58.620]
I don't know, not Hillary.

[02:10:59.040 --> 02:10:59.040]

[02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:01.880]
Guess who is maybe who likes to eat his jelly at the deli then in Hollywood.

[02:11:02.720 --> 02:11:03.700]
Oh, what's his clerk?

[02:11:04.260 --> 02:11:08.160]
Wesley Clark said to think he wants to avoid waiting till too late to make a decision this year

[02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:09.020]
whether to run for president.

[02:11:09.140 --> 02:11:11.220]
Mistakey made his failed 2004 bid.

[02:11:11.220 --> 02:11:13.040]
He said they didn't want you west.

[02:11:13.160 --> 02:11:14.180]
It wasn't that you waited too long.

[02:11:14.180 --> 02:11:15.680]
They didn't want you and they don't care for you.

[02:11:15.680 --> 02:11:16.500]
You need a good Rubin sandwich.

[02:11:16.620 --> 02:11:18.620]
That sounds really good for lunch though although I won't eat the bread.

[02:11:18.880 --> 02:11:19.620]
I will eat the bread.

[02:11:19.840 --> 02:11:20.600]
What's the big sentence?

[02:11:20.940 --> 02:11:21.540]
It's the Rubin pill.

[02:11:21.900 --> 02:11:21.980]
Huh?

[02:11:22.360 --> 02:11:23.220]
Just eat the Rubin?

[02:11:23.400 --> 02:11:23.940]
What does he look like?

[02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:29.160]
I think it was clear that I got in too late last time the retired general in the former NATO commander told the A&P an interview.

[02:11:29.360 --> 02:11:31.080]
I preferred law-blossed A&P myself.

[02:11:31.520 --> 02:11:31.960]
And Wegmans.

[02:11:32.440 --> 02:11:35.960]
Clark announced his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination September 2003.

[02:11:36.380 --> 02:11:40.060]
Just four months before the first vote for a cast, he didn't have a China-Mins chance in a purgatory.

[02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:45.660]
He dropped out of the race to the following February with his only victory in 14 caucuses and primaries coming in order to win the election.

[02:11:45.660 --> 02:11:46.080]
Oklahoma.

[02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:48.380]
And who now cares about a Democrat in Oklahoma, right?

[02:11:48.620 --> 02:11:48.760]
Right.

[02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:49.120]
Right.

[02:11:49.560 --> 02:11:53.740]
Clark is considering running again but he said the late start was one of the mistakes he learned from his last attempt.

[02:11:54.160 --> 02:11:56.880]
There was an inability to create a staff in a timely fashion Clark said.

[02:11:57.160 --> 02:11:58.980]
I didn't have a campaign manager until the end of November.

[02:11:59.040 --> 02:11:59.660]
I had no money.

[02:11:59.840 --> 02:12:02.920]
I had no strategy when I started and I was gagging on that Rubin sandwich.

[02:12:03.500 --> 02:12:05.420]
Plus he didn't even order the Kishki for a crime or a lot.

[02:12:05.520 --> 02:12:08.980]
How did you get a panda of the old Jewish vote in South Florida when you don't even eat the Kishki?

[02:12:09.620 --> 02:12:12.080]
Do we still have to who stole the Kishki or buy a who now did it?

[02:12:12.440 --> 02:12:12.800]
I don't know.

[02:12:12.940 --> 02:12:12.940]

[02:12:13.480 --> 02:12:14.360]
The polka guy.

[02:12:14.360 --> 02:12:15.160]
I'll look.

[02:12:15.420 --> 02:12:16.820]
Who stole the Kishka?

[02:12:17.120 --> 02:12:20.020]
So you didn't think there was such a thing in the chicken neck found it?

[02:12:20.240 --> 02:12:21.100]
It's not in there.

[02:12:21.320 --> 02:12:21.860]
I got it.

[02:12:21.940 --> 02:12:24.340]
It was my only faith-based initiative.

[02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:27.720]
He said it was one of several mistakes that if I were to run I hope I wouldn't repeat whatever that means.

[02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:29.320]
His only faith-based initiative.

[02:12:29.460 --> 02:12:30.120]
Well, what does that mean?

[02:12:30.500 --> 02:12:31.080]
I don't know what that means.

[02:12:31.500 --> 02:12:36.480]
Clark said one factor that changes the number of candidates who have announced their intentions or formed exploratory campaigns.

[02:12:36.940 --> 02:12:38.520]
The president's Frankie Ankivich on that.

[02:12:39.260 --> 02:12:39.440]
Yes.

[02:12:40.400 --> 02:12:43.420]
Frankie Ankivich is a Kishiancan and it's a who stole the Kishka?

[02:12:43.540 --> 02:12:44.620]
A capital record I believe.

[02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:45.640]
Maybe not.

[02:12:46.100 --> 02:12:46.740]
Who cares?

[02:12:49.120 --> 02:12:50.280]
Wait, I'll get you to the vocal?

[02:12:51.020 --> 02:12:51.340]
I see you.

[02:12:51.380 --> 02:12:52.940]
You stopped it because you thought that was it.

[02:12:53.220 --> 02:12:55.400]
No, I stopped it because I thought that was enough.

[02:12:55.820 --> 02:12:57.360]
Yeah, I want to hear a little of the vocal, man.

[02:12:57.820 --> 02:12:58.680]
Who now wants to hear that?

[02:12:58.960 --> 02:13:01.600]
I'm not a class.

[02:13:02.860 --> 02:13:03.780]
1309 under Paul.

[02:13:03.860 --> 02:13:04.380]
That's just fine.

[02:13:04.500 --> 02:13:06.860]
Let me see if the phone is pretty modest.

[02:13:07.180 --> 02:13:08.320]
I'll get to it.

[02:13:08.900 --> 02:13:11.220]
See, you've got to find that balance, baby.

[02:13:11.300 --> 02:13:14.480]
It's like trying to balance an elephant on your knee.

[02:13:14.700 --> 02:13:15.940]
You know, it's not easy balance.

[02:13:16.120 --> 02:13:17.620]
It's a very difficult balance, isn't it?

[02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:18.000]
Oh, yeah.

[02:13:18.380 --> 02:13:18.780]
Now it's not.

[02:13:20.020 --> 02:13:20.600]
WDQYM, hello.

[02:13:21.220 --> 02:13:22.060]
Hey, Neil, how are you?

[02:13:22.380 --> 02:13:22.700]
Good, sir.

[02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:26.420]
I'm glad Sunsetnaal finally got around to writing about Rich All retiring.

[02:13:26.700 --> 02:13:27.380]
Isn't that pathetic?

[02:13:27.580 --> 02:13:28.820]
He announces it Tuesday morning.

[02:13:28.940 --> 02:13:30.600]
The Harold is splashed it all over their website.

[02:13:30.600 --> 02:13:31.600]
They haven't a paper yesterday.

[02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:34.400]
And the Sunset will just discovered it this morning.

[02:13:34.500 --> 02:13:35.340]
What about your losers?

[02:13:35.340 --> 02:13:40.000]
I hope tomorrow they write about the Titanic sinking or Neil Armstrong landing on the moon.

[02:13:40.040 --> 02:13:41.860]
They've Lincoln had a bad headache, too, don't forget.

[02:13:42.520 --> 02:13:44.300]
Hey, I don't know if anyone told you.

[02:13:44.820 --> 02:13:46.160]
I apologize if they did.

[02:13:46.820 --> 02:13:48.780]
Game show network on Sunday night.

[02:13:48.940 --> 02:13:53.540]
They had the match game, the real story behind the blank is what it was called.

[02:13:54.020 --> 02:13:54.500]
Really?

[02:13:54.900 --> 02:13:55.820]
Yeah, it was really good.

[02:13:56.300 --> 02:14:00.060]
I had no idea that it was on in 1962.

[02:14:00.700 --> 02:14:02.940]
And I had no idea that everyone had it.

[02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:04.400]
Rich or Dawson, like, poisoned.

[02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:05.240]
Yes, they did.

[02:14:05.340 --> 02:14:06.740]
They could have been there.

[02:14:07.100 --> 02:14:07.280]
They could have been there.

[02:14:07.940 --> 02:14:08.020]
Huh?

[02:14:08.420 --> 02:14:09.540]
They couldn't have been there.

[02:14:09.840 --> 02:14:11.460]
He was an egocistical bastard.

[02:14:11.680 --> 02:14:13.300]
And he thought he hated the fact on the show.

[02:14:13.500 --> 02:14:17.620]
At the end, the winner would pick one of the panelists to match, remember?

[02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:20.140]
And he thought that he would automatically should be him every time.

[02:14:20.260 --> 02:14:22.000]
Because he was such a genius and such a superstar.

[02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:24.640]
And it shouldn't be Brett or Charles Randall's other losers.

[02:14:25.260 --> 02:14:26.640]
That's why they blew him off the show.

[02:14:26.960 --> 02:14:29.580]
That's why they installed that wheel to spend.

[02:14:30.060 --> 02:14:31.880]
So they had a chance to get to other people.

[02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:36.540]
And on the first night on the show that they did that, it landed on Richard.

[02:14:37.280 --> 02:14:38.980]
So they thought that was kind of funny.

[02:14:39.220 --> 02:14:40.860]
But yeah, they hated him like poison.

[02:14:40.980 --> 02:14:44.900]
And of course, don't forget when they hit family feud and they brought him back after Ray Comas blew his brains out.

[02:14:45.200 --> 02:14:46.060]
And they brought Richard Dawson back.

[02:14:46.120 --> 02:14:48.460]
He was like 400 pounds and sounded like he was drunk.

[02:14:48.720 --> 02:14:51.540]
I heard that, sir, Ray said he sounded like he was drunk all the time.

[02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:53.240]
He was like Dom Delewee.

[02:14:53.240 --> 02:14:53.480]
Yeah.

[02:14:53.820 --> 02:14:54.520]
Later on, but.

[02:14:54.680 --> 02:14:54.940]
Yeah.

[02:14:55.320 --> 02:14:57.360]
All the hurt Reynolds wasn't having dinners with him.

[02:14:57.500 --> 02:14:59.400]
What do you think about hurt Reynolds and Dom Delewee?

[02:14:59.480 --> 02:15:00.580]
Do you think there's like a little something there?

[02:15:00.580 --> 02:15:03.580]
Maybe they're just close like Oprah and her friend Gail.

[02:15:04.280 --> 02:15:05.840]
That's the honey tune, yeah.

[02:15:05.960 --> 02:15:06.140]
Yeah.

[02:15:06.520 --> 02:15:08.460]
Oprah instead, man, of course, that man's got a beard.

[02:15:09.160 --> 02:15:11.620]
Sarah Soda almost since the time, wait, you got to hear this.

[02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:12.580]
This is about Florida.

[02:15:12.580 --> 02:15:14.020]
Can't hold an election and get it right.

[02:15:14.600 --> 02:15:17.280]
Almost since the time the votes were tallied on election night and service.

[02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:23.500]
So the race for Florida's 13th congressional district has been surrounded by a contentious mystery it says.

[02:15:25.380 --> 02:15:30.220]
Why would there no votes for Congress recorded for more than 18,000 people who chose candidates.

[02:15:30.220 --> 02:15:31.500]
And other races they ask.

[02:15:32.380 --> 02:15:39.340]
The answer is sent to a lot more of the outcome in the election, which for now has been won by Republican Bernbue Cannon by a mere 369 votes and is in litigation.

[02:15:39.760 --> 02:15:43.300]
But also to the continuing debates over where the electronic voting system is in use nationwide.

[02:15:43.720 --> 02:15:45.520]
Can yield reliable tallies and recon.

[02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:46.780]
And of course, the answer is.

[02:15:46.880 --> 02:15:47.620]
No, of course not.

[02:15:47.960 --> 02:15:51.060]
So far, there are three theories and lots of political and legal posturing.

[02:15:51.560 --> 02:15:55.500]
Maybe a scores of voters have said there were glitches with the touchscreen systems and they drop votes.

[02:15:55.500 --> 02:16:00.320]
Or maybe voters overlooked the congressional race simply because of a confusing ballot design.

[02:16:00.700 --> 02:16:06.560]
Or maybe a some say an astoundingly high number of Sarasota County residents decided to forego voting in the high profile race,

[02:16:06.720 --> 02:16:10.580]
which is for the seed being vacated by the anxious sub-noxious Catherine Harris here about her playing.

[02:16:10.960 --> 02:16:15.880]
And who presented over Florida's election apparatus during the much disputed 2000 contest between Bush and Gore.

[02:16:16.540 --> 02:16:20.820]
Tuesday, a state election officials in Saris, Sodor, Rana, Maka, lesson to test the machines for defects.

[02:16:20.980 --> 02:16:22.300]
There were no clear answers.

[02:16:22.300 --> 02:16:26.220]
By evening, as clerical workers input votes, no major problems were reported with the machines,

[02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:28.120]
but the review will continue through the week.

[02:16:28.640 --> 02:16:32.520]
Our analysis of the results shows that something went very wrong, said Kendall Coffee,

[02:16:32.860 --> 02:16:36.540]
who never had a camera, a reporter or any of media outlet that he wasn't in love with,

[02:16:36.900 --> 02:16:39.200]
and attorney for Buchanan's challenger, Christine Jennings.

[02:16:39.580 --> 02:16:45.660]
He played out a significance of the test saying they didn't replicate the voting because the state clerical workers were presumably more adept at the machinery

[02:16:45.660 --> 02:16:47.200]
than voters in general would be.

[02:16:47.480 --> 02:16:50.220]
They were better with the machine, Mom. They knew how to operate a good machine.

[02:16:50.940 --> 02:16:55.140]
Hayden Dempsey, an attorney who Buchanan said, there's nothing wrong with the machines as these test show.

[02:16:55.440 --> 02:16:57.480]
I've actually rick riley voter for Buchanan, thought it was Pat.

[02:16:58.300 --> 02:17:00.260]
Hey, Rick, you redneck. George hates you.

[02:17:00.800 --> 02:17:06.120]
The essence of these updated spewterizers from the fact that once all the votes were counted in November 7th election,

[02:17:06.440 --> 02:17:08.220]
a troubling anomaly appeared in the tally.

[02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:13.600]
More than 18,000 people who had voted another contest didn't have selections recorded in congressional race.

[02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:18.360]
The phenomenon of voter is casting ballots without making selections in every race known as under voting,

[02:17:18.360 --> 02:17:23.360]
and happens in virtually every big election, especially in contest for election on orfuses that some voters ignore.

[02:17:23.580 --> 02:17:25.440]
But here's the big but, okay?

[02:17:26.200 --> 02:17:27.560]
Did he die or something or what?

[02:17:27.660 --> 02:17:28.040]
No, wait.

[02:17:28.420 --> 02:17:34.680]
Oh. But the magnitude of the under voting in the Buchanan Jennings race was starving about 15% of those who cast ballots in Sarasota.

[02:17:35.040 --> 02:17:37.860]
That contrast was about 2.5% among voters in other counties.

[02:17:38.140 --> 02:17:43.480]
15% count them in Sarasota, where I used to work at WSPV out there on City Island.

[02:17:43.820 --> 02:17:44.840]
What a beautiful place.

[02:17:44.840 --> 02:17:53.080]
Would like a lot of you think the people in Margator Older, the people in Boka, their grandparents live in Sarasota?

[02:17:53.360 --> 02:17:54.860]
Good God, what an ancient place.

[02:17:55.380 --> 02:18:01.940]
Jennings had filed a lawsuit alleging that thousands of Sarasota with county votes were not counted because of the pervasive malfunctioning of electronic voting machines.

[02:18:02.380 --> 02:18:03.620]
The county tilts in her favor.

[02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:11.940]
The broken machine theory is backed by two voting experts and scores of sworn statements from voters who had trouble with the machines coffee said they were bad machines mine.

[02:18:11.940 --> 02:18:13.760]
Like several other ones that would buy.

[02:18:14.140 --> 02:18:17.600]
The Sarasota hero tribune is reported that more than 100 reported problems with the machines.

[02:18:18.060 --> 02:18:24.460]
But other experts who've analyzed the ballots and results argue that the culprit might not be the machines, but rather voters confused by a poorly designed ballot.

[02:18:24.880 --> 02:18:32.940]
The congressional race appeared on the same screen as the gubernatorial contest, which had a brighter banner and took up more space and like big bright lights like, hey, here you go, here's Charlie Criss gate.

[02:18:33.620 --> 02:18:44.380]
Ted Selkhr, the Massachusetts Institute Technology, director of the Caltech MIT voting technology project, said test in his library, shown that as many as 60% of voters can miss races when they're displayed in such a manner.

[02:18:44.940 --> 02:18:48.140]
So, but a beef, but a loop, but I say they have a repo, which is what they're calling for.

[02:18:48.720 --> 02:18:49.540]
Right, let's do it again.

[02:18:50.020 --> 02:18:50.280]
Do it.

[02:18:50.760 --> 02:18:53.060]
Do it again like the beach boys would say, do it again.

[02:18:53.160 --> 02:18:54.720]
I know you got that. We keep playing that over.

[02:18:55.100 --> 02:18:56.640]
Now, what's that that bit we got to do it again?

[02:18:57.500 --> 02:18:58.820]
Oh, it's called Croubles again.

[02:18:58.820 --> 02:19:06.360]
Oh, I love that. I only play that once I can about the last in a dog's age, speaking of sick as a dog.

[02:19:06.440 --> 02:19:08.020]
Here's your vote automatically.

[02:19:09.740 --> 02:19:11.600]
So, that just might be coming up right after the break.

[02:19:11.740 --> 02:19:13.580]
You didn't realize that we were playing the boat at the same time.

[02:19:14.040 --> 02:19:14.620]
You were playing what?

[02:19:15.060 --> 02:19:15.460]
Do it again.

[02:19:15.660 --> 02:19:17.460]
Because it was like in simultaneous, right?

[02:19:17.660 --> 02:19:19.040]
Like a simultaneous orange gasm?

[02:19:19.480 --> 02:19:19.640]
Wow.

[02:19:20.480 --> 02:19:20.660]
Woo!

[02:19:21.640 --> 02:19:23.320]
Almost having a sexual experience with it.

[02:19:24.360 --> 02:19:25.900]
1328 votes on a pool.

[02:19:26.120 --> 02:19:28.620]
And let's see, we're up to 6% retire now.

[02:19:28.800 --> 02:19:30.700]
All right. We can get up to 90%.

[02:19:31.320 --> 02:19:31.840]
All right.

[02:19:32.100 --> 02:19:34.540]
Let me have a guy in my mouth and get on.

[02:19:34.680 --> 02:19:34.920]
Roger.

[02:19:35.320 --> 02:19:36.840]
4th radio, 560.

[02:19:37.100 --> 02:19:38.260]
You A.M.

[02:19:40.640 --> 02:19:42.080]
Florida Panthers hockey.

[02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:44.340]
Drop that rock.

[02:19:44.780 --> 02:19:46.640]
I'm so into the score!

[02:19:47.780 --> 02:19:50.320]
I'm in the score!

[02:19:50.320 --> 02:19:54.780]
And tonight, Guy co-presents the Panthers and the Santers from Scotiabane Place in Ottawa.

[02:19:55.040 --> 02:19:58.380]
Cover starts at 7 p.m. with Panthers 3D treatment by G and Lexus.

[02:19:58.560 --> 02:20:01.320]
On spool 3 you'll find the C.U.A.M.

[02:20:01.400 --> 02:20:02.980]
Holy macken on!

[02:20:03.220 --> 02:20:08.600]
This is Joe Bow on the voice of the Toronto May Beliefs, and you're listening to the hockey authority Neil God!

[02:20:11.080 --> 02:20:11.900]
All right.

[02:20:12.220 --> 02:20:13.800]
Here goes automatically.

[02:20:13.800 --> 02:20:18.260]
Now you made it by your shooters at the G.O.P.

[02:20:18.340 --> 02:20:20.860]
Then it be made in this time.

[02:20:21.160 --> 02:20:24.340]
Don't let the last G.O.C.

[02:20:24.540 --> 02:20:25.900]
Construence again.

[02:20:27.920 --> 02:20:32.200]
The brother of the winner that's drawn in Toronto

[02:20:32.200 --> 02:20:34.740]
Now it's got another magic.

[02:20:35.160 --> 02:20:40.780]
Yes, we vote the this time. Don't let the last G.O.C.

[02:20:40.780 --> 02:20:42.400]
The first room is a game.

[02:20:43.460 --> 02:20:46.700]
Some will let us in. Let us in.

[02:20:47.020 --> 02:20:48.780]
Those are staffers in.

[02:20:49.040 --> 02:20:52.560]
The inside face in the mandat, you got given.

[02:20:53.140 --> 02:20:54.900]
Let us set us up.

[02:20:55.340 --> 02:20:57.780]
We don't need a game. Let us in.

[02:20:58.080 --> 02:21:00.780]
Let us in. We might have been in.

[02:21:01.920 --> 02:21:06.620]
Then go try and look for the winner.

[02:21:06.620 --> 02:21:09.480]
And call the stars.

[02:21:10.540 --> 02:21:14.340]
Find noise with a lot of fear.

[02:21:15.420 --> 02:21:15.920]
Absolutely.

[02:21:19.040 --> 02:21:22.540]
The truth is kill the rice boy.

[02:21:23.320 --> 02:21:25.760]
The truth is kill the rice.

[02:21:25.820 --> 02:21:28.120]
The bushes are pointed by the fire.

[02:21:28.120 --> 02:21:28.600]
The wind is blowing.

[02:21:28.920 --> 02:21:30.880]
The wind is blowing.

[02:21:31.260 --> 02:21:32.880]
The wind is blowing.

[02:21:32.880 --> 02:21:34.520]
The wind is blowing.

[02:21:34.520 --> 02:21:36.200]
The wind is blowing.

[02:21:36.200 --> 02:21:37.140]
The wind is blowing.

[02:21:38.280 --> 02:21:40.040]
The wind is blowing.

[02:21:40.300 --> 02:21:41.700]
The wind is blowing.

[02:21:41.960 --> 02:21:55.120]
The wind is blowing.

[02:21:55.880 --> 02:21:56.340]
The wind is blowing.

[02:21:59.920 --> 02:22:01.080]
The wind is blowing.

[02:22:01.080 --> 02:22:01.900]
The wind is blowing.

[02:22:04.020 --> 02:22:04.880]
The wind is blowing.

[02:22:05.260 --> 02:22:06.380]
That was a great fit.

[02:22:06.600 --> 02:22:08.140]
We need to play it a lot more all the time.

[02:22:08.300 --> 02:22:08.820]
This is a reminder.

[02:22:09.100 --> 02:22:09.900]
Okay, screw us again.

[02:22:10.020 --> 02:22:10.580]
Stick it to us.

[02:22:10.780 --> 02:22:11.640]
Keep fixing the elections.

[02:22:11.860 --> 02:22:12.680]
Keep pretty machines.

[02:22:13.040 --> 02:22:14.700]
The dye and over here bold machines.

[02:22:15.280 --> 02:22:16.740]
You got to be pretty bold to dye like that.

[02:22:16.740 --> 02:22:18.380]
The 36 votes on the poll.

[02:22:19.460 --> 02:22:20.880]
The phone is a week.

[02:22:22.200 --> 02:22:23.600]
That's a poll we could take every day.

[02:22:23.880 --> 02:22:24.500]
The calls are back.

[02:22:25.700 --> 02:22:26.940]
We can do that every day.

[02:22:28.140 --> 02:22:28.920]
At least put the week.

[02:22:29.460 --> 02:22:31.040]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:22:31.600 --> 02:22:32.860]
What I think is it's only Thursday.

[02:22:33.080 --> 02:22:34.640]
New folks are already out of material.

[02:22:35.360 --> 02:22:37.440]
All these moving portante things going on in the world.

[02:22:37.440 --> 02:22:40.300]
Like we got the big storm coming this week in here.

[02:22:40.640 --> 02:22:41.420]
Snow and sleigh.

[02:22:41.500 --> 02:22:43.000]
I got to put on my tracks on my shoes.

[02:22:43.700 --> 02:22:45.460]
Thank God for George for sending me in.

[02:22:45.480 --> 02:22:47.480]
If you really think I'm putting those on, man, you must be dreaming.

[02:22:47.740 --> 02:22:48.240]
What are these days?

[02:22:48.800 --> 02:22:48.920]
Why?

[02:22:49.240 --> 02:22:49.620]
What are these days?

[02:22:49.620 --> 02:22:50.740]
It'll be really icy out there.

[02:22:50.780 --> 02:22:51.660]
And if you're smart, you will.

[02:22:52.100 --> 02:22:53.200]
And if I'm smart, I'll stay in.

[02:22:53.660 --> 02:22:53.940]
Okay.

[02:22:54.600 --> 02:22:55.580]
In fact, it's already...

[02:22:55.580 --> 02:22:56.460]
What was it before I told you?

[02:22:56.500 --> 02:22:58.160]
It was like 50 or something and it's already down to 41.

[02:22:58.340 --> 02:22:59.300]
The temperature is dropping.

[02:22:59.640 --> 02:23:00.400]
The rain is going to start.

[02:23:00.480 --> 02:23:01.940]
That's going to become freezing rain.

[02:23:02.260 --> 02:23:03.120]
Mixed with four reasons.

[02:23:03.380 --> 02:23:04.920]
Snow and schmutz and stuff like that.

[02:23:05.020 --> 02:23:05.300]
And you know what?

[02:23:05.360 --> 02:23:06.740]
I'd still rather be here any day of the week.

[02:23:07.440 --> 02:23:08.920]
I'd still be at snow up to my eyeballs.

[02:23:09.560 --> 02:23:12.920]
And if it was minus 85 Fahrenheit, I'd still be making a difference to me.

[02:23:13.380 --> 02:23:16.060]
That's how much I reviled the whole concept of being in Florida.

[02:23:17.080 --> 02:23:19.360]
Reviled and grossed out by it, nauseated,

[02:23:19.620 --> 02:23:21.080]
want to peep my guts out from it.

[02:23:21.460 --> 02:23:22.800]
Not even just to mention that studio.

[02:23:23.180 --> 02:23:23.600]
Oh, brother.

[02:23:24.020 --> 02:23:26.460]
But nice to see all the Americans in progress in their thanks to your pen knife.

[02:23:26.940 --> 02:23:28.760]
Some people I've been in, hell's George has a pen knife.

[02:23:28.840 --> 02:23:29.520]
It's not a pen knife.

[02:23:29.680 --> 02:23:30.800]
It's a jack knife.

[02:23:31.100 --> 02:23:32.020]
Whatever the hell it is.

[02:23:32.200 --> 02:23:32.760]
A rake jack.

[02:23:33.320 --> 02:23:33.480]
Five.

[02:23:34.380 --> 02:23:35.160]
Oh, boy.

[02:23:35.560 --> 02:23:37.520]
Five six seven, oh five sixty.

[02:23:38.140 --> 02:23:39.000]
Pond five, sixty.

[02:23:39.120 --> 02:23:41.260]
And they've arrived in a singular wireless lines.

[02:23:41.400 --> 02:23:43.040]
Very weak action on the phone today.

[02:23:43.180 --> 02:23:44.140]
You call this action.

[02:23:44.460 --> 02:23:46.140]
Even a unit gets more action than this.

[02:23:46.220 --> 02:23:46.920]
This is prophetic.

[02:23:47.960 --> 02:23:48.640]
WQA and hello.

[02:23:49.180 --> 02:23:49.580]
Not there.

[02:23:49.660 --> 02:23:49.900]
See it.

[02:23:49.900 --> 02:23:51.220]
It's like only one of the line flashing.

[02:23:51.320 --> 02:23:51.620]
That's it.

[02:23:51.920 --> 02:23:53.020]
We want the colors back.

[02:23:53.140 --> 02:23:54.140]
Well, where the hell are they, man?

[02:23:54.420 --> 02:23:55.280]
Where's their material?

[02:23:55.700 --> 02:23:56.540]
And can it be felt?

[02:23:57.660 --> 02:23:58.380]
WQA and hello.

[02:23:58.760 --> 02:23:59.220]
Hey now.

[02:23:59.440 --> 02:23:59.880]
How you doing, Neil?

[02:24:00.280 --> 02:24:00.640]
Yes, sir.

[02:24:00.920 --> 02:24:03.840]
I just want to have my two cents in on the other collar said that.

[02:24:03.840 --> 02:24:07.620]
I think more Josh and less Georgia's not as intelligent, but more responsive.

[02:24:09.140 --> 02:24:09.860]
More responsive.

[02:24:10.520 --> 02:24:13.000]
Yeah, when you talk to George, he's talking to him in the background.

[02:24:13.180 --> 02:24:13.660]
Oh, yeah.

[02:24:14.020 --> 02:24:15.180]
Lay a leg.

[02:24:15.520 --> 02:24:15.520]

[02:24:15.840 --> 02:24:16.580]
Lay a big egg.

[02:24:16.620 --> 02:24:17.420]
You're already laid over one.

[02:24:17.480 --> 02:24:18.000]
Lay a big one.

[02:24:18.460 --> 02:24:19.020]
And sit on it.

[02:24:19.140 --> 02:24:19.900]
See if he can hatch it.

[02:24:20.480 --> 02:24:21.820]
Same old tire banana.

[02:24:22.060 --> 02:24:22.720]
See that he wants to.

[02:24:22.820 --> 02:24:23.660]
Josh, that's all he wants.

[02:24:23.780 --> 02:24:23.840]
He wants to.

[02:24:23.920 --> 02:24:24.600]
He wants to.

[02:24:24.900 --> 02:24:26.980]
You can go back and get a color idea on it.

[02:24:27.100 --> 02:24:28.540]
Maybe you guys can hook up a little later on.

[02:24:29.160 --> 02:24:30.920]
Josh's cell phone number is 954.

[02:24:31.440 --> 02:24:32.920]
Five, six, seven, oh five, sixty.

[02:24:32.920 --> 02:24:34.260]
That's the number to reach him in.

[02:24:34.460 --> 02:24:35.220]
And pound five, sixty.

[02:24:35.740 --> 02:24:36.200]
I'm even rising.

[02:24:36.320 --> 02:24:38.140]
Oh, now all of a sudden that delay caught up.

[02:24:38.240 --> 02:24:40.040]
See how many delays we got, would you say?

[02:24:40.060 --> 02:24:40.920]
About 30, man.

[02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:42.860]
Because of the stern days we got delays.

[02:24:43.020 --> 02:24:44.660]
We got delays up the old chute, baby.

[02:24:44.820 --> 02:24:45.240]
Up the.

[02:24:45.500 --> 02:24:45.840]
Chute.

[02:24:46.060 --> 02:24:46.220]
Yes.

[02:24:47.180 --> 02:24:47.540]
Unbelievable.

[02:24:47.940 --> 02:24:48.820]
How many delays we got?

[02:24:48.960 --> 02:24:50.300]
And it's, we got Tom to leave.

[02:24:50.480 --> 02:24:51.680]
And let's stick the old.

[02:24:51.860 --> 02:24:52.180]
Chute.

[02:24:52.380 --> 02:24:52.720]
His button.

[02:24:52.720 --> 02:24:53.620]
See how that works out.

[02:24:53.800 --> 02:24:55.040]
And believe me, many of these colors.

[02:24:55.040 --> 02:24:55.780]
That's where they belong.

[02:24:56.860 --> 02:24:57.220]
WQAM.

[02:24:57.340 --> 02:24:57.520]
Hello.

[02:24:57.980 --> 02:24:58.260]
Now.

[02:24:58.520 --> 02:24:59.140]
Yes, sir.

[02:25:00.100 --> 02:25:00.460]
Hey.

[02:25:00.460 --> 02:25:00.540]
Hey.

[02:25:00.820 --> 02:25:01.380]
A little.

[02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:02.040]
A little.

[02:25:02.160 --> 02:25:02.440]
A little tree here.

[02:25:03.060 --> 02:25:06.440]
Hey, uh, is treaty Carlos still working a front desk there?

[02:25:06.800 --> 02:25:07.460]
It's for Zino.

[02:25:07.560 --> 02:25:08.300]
How do I know what I know?

[02:25:08.300 --> 02:25:09.000]
I'm not in that building.

[02:25:09.040 --> 02:25:09.600]
Thank God.

[02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:10.760]
Is he still out there, guys?

[02:25:11.180 --> 02:25:11.720]
Yeah, of course.

[02:25:12.180 --> 02:25:12.700]
All right.

[02:25:13.040 --> 02:25:13.940]
Well, that's how I was in there.

[02:25:13.940 --> 02:25:16.780]
You know, uh, hey, well, yes, they was kind of, uh,

[02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:18.440]
uh, wore me some tickets to the ballgame.

[02:25:18.540 --> 02:25:19.620]
I'm coming in there to pick them up.

[02:25:19.640 --> 02:25:20.500]
You know, that's how I was in there.

[02:25:20.560 --> 02:25:22.620]
He was, you know, sizing me up there pretty good.

[02:25:22.780 --> 02:25:22.880]
So.

[02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:23.320]
Yeah, okay.

[02:25:23.500 --> 02:25:23.600]
Good.

[02:25:24.440 --> 02:25:25.040]
How many QAM?

[02:25:25.120 --> 02:25:25.400]
Hello.

[02:25:25.720 --> 02:25:27.480]
Sounds like swishful thinking of me, sweetheart.

[02:25:27.880 --> 02:25:28.160]
QAM.

[02:25:28.160 --> 02:25:30.820]
Hey, Neil, have you thought about doing a power hour?

[02:25:31.340 --> 02:25:33.120]
I mean, was, you know, someone or something?

[02:25:33.120 --> 02:25:33.280]
No.

[02:25:33.420 --> 02:25:34.820]
What do I need a power hour for?

[02:25:34.960 --> 02:25:35.700]
What do you mean by that?

[02:25:36.200 --> 02:25:37.020]
Don't you understand?

[02:25:37.240 --> 02:25:38.780]
Don't you understand why they do that?

[02:25:39.560 --> 02:25:40.240]
Uh, rating.

[02:25:40.660 --> 02:25:40.940]
No.

[02:25:41.360 --> 02:25:43.800]
They do it because they're both being paid to do three hours.

[02:25:44.160 --> 02:25:45.680]
And there are only five hours in there.

[02:25:45.780 --> 02:25:48.160]
How do you divide five by three and get two?

[02:25:48.260 --> 02:25:48.520]
You don't.

[02:25:48.680 --> 02:25:50.040]
So they have to do like three hours.

[02:25:50.040 --> 02:25:50.960]
One of them has to be together.

[02:25:51.240 --> 02:25:52.740]
That was the, I bailed them out on that.

[02:25:52.740 --> 02:25:54.940]
I, I, I still want to come up with that idea.

[02:25:55.460 --> 02:25:56.860]
What thought of I wanted to do a power hour with?

[02:25:56.880 --> 02:25:57.940]
Who the hell do I get out of here?

[02:25:57.980 --> 02:25:58.920]
Am I going to do a power hour?

[02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:00.500]
I'm going to do a power shower, okay?

[02:26:00.860 --> 02:26:02.260]
I'm going to stick the nozzle right in your...

[02:26:02.260 --> 02:26:02.700]
SHOOT!

[02:26:02.840 --> 02:26:03.320]
Get out of here.

[02:26:03.700 --> 02:26:05.060]
What is with these people?

[02:26:05.060 --> 02:26:06.020]
They have no material.

[02:26:06.620 --> 02:26:09.080]
I think that guy on my Myspace thing, I think he had a point.

[02:26:09.240 --> 02:26:13.220]
I would allow myself to be led by the nose by a public opinion.

[02:26:13.680 --> 02:26:15.440]
Let's write down the garden path and by George,

[02:26:15.440 --> 02:26:17.920]
who hated those bedtime stories like a, a passion.

[02:26:18.240 --> 02:26:18.620]
That's right.

[02:26:19.020 --> 02:26:20.940]
And by Josh, who just talks to Dan much.

[02:26:20.940 --> 02:26:21.840]
Is that what the guy just said?

[02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:22.460]
That's what he said.

[02:26:22.920 --> 02:26:24.020]
What the hell was that all about?

[02:26:24.620 --> 02:26:26.460]
Everybody knows their role on this show.

[02:26:26.560 --> 02:26:29.960]
And everybody's a fine, wonderful job, except Miguel, of course,

[02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:30.980]
who's busy doing Myspace.

[02:26:31.260 --> 02:26:32.800]
And thank you very much for it, by the way.

[02:26:32.940 --> 02:26:34.240]
Did I say that when I came on here this morning?

[02:26:34.380 --> 02:26:34.800]
Yes, you did.

[02:26:35.880 --> 02:26:36.920]
Hey, listen, you know me.

[02:26:37.020 --> 02:26:38.940]
I'm an old emotional cripple, okay?

[02:26:39.040 --> 02:26:40.060]
An old emotional fag.

[02:26:40.180 --> 02:26:42.800]
I try to tell you, the media response, if you're like a...

[02:26:42.800 --> 02:26:42.940]
That's right.

[02:26:43.080 --> 02:26:45.420]
...wounded and hurt and like, you know, it's just a...

[02:26:45.420 --> 02:26:46.400]
Like a puppy love, you know.

[02:26:46.480 --> 02:26:48.520]
It's not most people's primary email address.

[02:26:48.540 --> 02:26:49.540]
They check it whenever.

[02:26:50.260 --> 02:26:51.460]
They're Myspace messages.

[02:26:51.800 --> 02:26:52.100]
Yeah.

[02:26:52.420 --> 02:26:53.280]
So, you know.

[02:26:53.640 --> 02:26:55.480]
Hey, listen, I'm a pretty important important guy.

[02:26:56.640 --> 02:26:57.580]
Yeah, to some of this.

[02:26:57.880 --> 02:26:58.700]
Yeah, whatever you say.

[02:26:59.040 --> 02:27:00.240]
It's just more of that fantasy.

[02:27:00.560 --> 02:27:01.420]
What were we talking about yesterday?

[02:27:01.660 --> 02:27:03.720]
The same thing about how much of our lives is like fantasy?

[02:27:03.980 --> 02:27:04.260]
Mm-hmm.

[02:27:04.600 --> 02:27:06.920]
See, I just don't understand when you're like in a shopping mall.

[02:27:07.220 --> 02:27:09.080]
And you see somebody who looks really, really good.

[02:27:09.200 --> 02:27:09.380]
You...

[02:27:09.380 --> 02:27:11.900]
I can't just like put Alicia around in there and grab him and take him home

[02:27:11.900 --> 02:27:12.840]
and they have your way with him.

[02:27:12.980 --> 02:27:14.220]
What's the fun of time you could have?

[02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:15.640]
Well, so what's wrong with that?

[02:27:15.860 --> 02:27:16.720]
I think it's a good idea.

[02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:18.940]
And they probably would enjoy it and have a good time on their face.

[02:27:18.940 --> 02:27:19.900]
And grab him on.

[02:27:19.900 --> 02:27:21.180]
We're talking about abusing them.

[02:27:21.180 --> 02:27:23.780]
We're like, you know, well, sometimes they're not compliant.

[02:27:24.140 --> 02:27:26.120]
Unless they want to be abused and apply them.

[02:27:27.800 --> 02:27:29.840]
God, I just don't understand this world.

[02:27:30.080 --> 02:27:31.280]
But then again, you do the best you can.

[02:27:31.380 --> 02:27:31.920]
That's what you can do.

[02:27:32.140 --> 02:27:33.080]
That's my motto in life.

[02:27:33.360 --> 02:27:35.820]
Do the best you can, especially when you work for A-holes.

[02:27:37.160 --> 02:27:37.800]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:27:38.200 --> 02:27:38.740]
I'm gay.

[02:27:39.820 --> 02:27:40.540]
Working, congratulations.

[02:27:41.700 --> 02:27:42.420]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:27:42.900 --> 02:27:43.660]
Well, that was Charlie Christ.

[02:27:44.480 --> 02:27:45.080]
QAM, hello.

[02:27:45.200 --> 02:27:45.660]
I need you.

[02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:46.580]
Yes, ma'am.

[02:27:46.580 --> 02:27:47.080]
Hi.

[02:27:47.460 --> 02:27:51.620]
I just wanted to tell George I missed him last week for Thanksgiving when he wasn't around.

[02:27:52.160 --> 02:27:52.900]
I missed you too.

[02:27:53.980 --> 02:27:54.600]
And I want you to.

[02:27:54.600 --> 02:27:56.520]
She missed you last week for Thanksgiving when you weren't around.

[02:27:56.600 --> 02:27:57.780]
How come I have two lines punched up?

[02:27:57.920 --> 02:27:58.320]
Here, go ahead.

[02:27:58.880 --> 02:28:01.500]
And thank you for being my my space friends.

[02:28:01.780 --> 02:28:04.920]
I have you on my top friends list and it adds some credibility to my life.

[02:28:05.320 --> 02:28:05.420]
Oh, okay.

[02:28:05.420 --> 02:28:08.180]
And I really like to picture with the little glasses on it.

[02:28:08.220 --> 02:28:08.940]
It's so adorable.

[02:28:09.180 --> 02:28:09.740]
It is.

[02:28:09.920 --> 02:28:10.220]
Isn't that cute?

[02:28:10.580 --> 02:28:11.040]
The doctor often does picture.

[02:28:11.040 --> 02:28:11.500]
Yeah, I love it.

[02:28:11.660 --> 02:28:12.860]
It's better than the caricature.

[02:28:13.020 --> 02:28:13.220]
Hello.

[02:28:13.380 --> 02:28:13.620]
Okay.

[02:28:13.620 --> 02:28:14.940]
You guys have a great day.

[02:28:15.140 --> 02:28:15.680]
And you too.

[02:28:15.840 --> 02:28:16.200]
Bye.

[02:28:17.080 --> 02:28:18.800]
Okay, so I just knocked him both off of there.

[02:28:18.840 --> 02:28:20.700]
Well, I think he had his moment in a sunshine.

[02:28:21.240 --> 02:28:21.380]
Hello.

[02:28:21.460 --> 02:28:23.560]
He had two lines punched up for some reason there.

[02:28:23.760 --> 02:28:25.600]
He sounded way more interesting than him anyway.

[02:28:26.060 --> 02:28:29.120]
Yeah, well, I'm sure she would because she wears a skirted dress on my back.

[02:28:29.340 --> 02:28:29.340]

[02:28:29.340 --> 02:28:30.220]
You got the right body part.

[02:28:30.380 --> 02:28:30.960]
She's got booby.

[02:28:31.040 --> 02:28:31.420]
That's right.

[02:28:31.920 --> 02:28:34.140]
So, you're right, he's in some that interesting.

[02:28:34.560 --> 02:28:34.780]
Hello.

[02:28:35.020 --> 02:28:35.680]
She was bubbly.

[02:28:35.780 --> 02:28:36.220]
She was fun.

[02:28:36.520 --> 02:28:37.300]
And she was very nice.

[02:28:37.760 --> 02:28:37.960]
What?

[02:28:38.520 --> 02:28:39.460]
Why are you knocking the guy?

[02:28:39.540 --> 02:28:40.840]
Maybe he had something really important to say.

[02:28:40.840 --> 02:28:42.140]
I'm sure he didn't, but maybe he did.

[02:28:42.760 --> 02:28:45.940]
Maybe the carter was going to turn his whole carter thing all around, you know?

[02:28:46.420 --> 02:28:48.580]
Like, oh, you think the dolphins can run the table?

[02:28:48.740 --> 02:28:49.260]
Yeah, run this.

[02:28:49.480 --> 02:28:51.760]
I think the dolphins ought to hide under the tables, what I think.

[02:28:52.140 --> 02:28:55.720]
I think any team that's got Joey Harrington and quarterback ought to be thinking very seriously

[02:28:55.720 --> 02:28:59.340]
of thanking all the rest of the games and seeing the thing being destroyed out to get Brady Quinn.

[02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:00.880]
Is that what you're thinking, Josh?

[02:29:01.320 --> 02:29:01.520]
Not.

[02:29:02.200 --> 02:29:02.920]
Josh doesn't care.

[02:29:03.040 --> 02:29:06.100]
All he cares about is that maybe the bucks might win one more game before the season is out.

[02:29:06.480 --> 02:29:09.200]
And I don't know what their schedule is, but boy, I wouldn't be, uh...

[02:29:09.200 --> 02:29:10.140]
Now, who did play the...

[02:29:10.140 --> 02:29:11.960]
Oh, that's right, the penguins this week, the...

[02:29:11.960 --> 02:29:12.400]
The Steelers.

[02:29:12.500 --> 02:29:12.840]
That's right, my name's Bobby.

[02:29:13.380 --> 02:29:15.380]
That's right, my name's Bobby playing the freaking...

[02:29:15.380 --> 02:29:19.900]
And by the way, the fact that Paul Staggerwald stabbed Mike Lang in the back in Pittsburgh

[02:29:19.900 --> 02:29:24.240]
and got to TV gig in Mike who's doing a radio now, Paul Staggerwald blows, okay?

[02:29:24.480 --> 02:29:25.580]
Let me just tell you that right now.

[02:29:25.820 --> 02:29:28.780]
He couldn't lick Mike Lang's jockstrap.

[02:29:29.480 --> 02:29:30.440]
He threw him.

[02:29:30.800 --> 02:29:31.960]
He took the job for Fibelstie.

[02:29:32.460 --> 02:29:33.560]
And here's Birdgate with him.

[02:29:33.820 --> 02:29:34.880]
Well, it's got nothing to do with that game.

[02:29:34.960 --> 02:29:36.340]
That's in San Jose, Minnesota.

[02:29:36.900 --> 02:29:38.680]
Oh, who now wants to watch Minnesota, my God?

[02:29:38.680 --> 02:29:39.800]
Never been to Minnesota.

[02:29:39.840 --> 02:29:40.620]
A lot of Swedes.

[02:29:40.700 --> 02:29:41.660]
There are a lot of anti-Semites.

[02:29:42.180 --> 02:29:43.200]
Maybe that's why I never been there.

[02:29:43.520 --> 02:29:45.320]
You ever been to a Minneapolis St. Paula Twin Cities?

[02:29:45.580 --> 02:29:45.940]
Yes, I have.

[02:29:46.400 --> 02:29:47.920]
And a beautiful area.

[02:29:48.640 --> 02:29:49.780]
Clean, lots of lakes.

[02:29:50.360 --> 02:29:50.920]
Oh, like Florida.

[02:29:51.180 --> 02:29:52.280]
Beautiful areas just the wrong people.

[02:29:52.640 --> 02:29:54.020]
Oh, that the people were very nice to me.

[02:29:54.400 --> 02:29:55.080]
Were they very friendly?

[02:29:55.480 --> 02:29:56.900]
Maybe like the Canadian people.

[02:29:57.320 --> 02:29:59.260]
The Newy Gray laid back like the UPS guy.

[02:29:59.420 --> 02:29:59.940]
Like to the movies.

[02:30:00.140 --> 02:30:01.400]
So that he was so damn ugly and old.

[02:30:02.020 --> 02:30:05.320]

The biggest name of best talents to this is Mio Rogers,

[02:31:04.380 --> 02:31:06.520]
4th radio 560-6-8-L.

[02:31:08.420 --> 02:31:11.840]
Only in the Banana Republic baby. Only in Miami.

[02:31:17.520 --> 02:31:17.700]
Here's Harry.

[02:31:23.520 --> 02:31:25.680]
Oh Miami has the dolphins.

[02:31:25.680 --> 02:31:27.840]
And here we go again.

[02:31:28.140 --> 02:31:32.600]
Another losing season that's never gone and sure.

[02:31:32.600 --> 02:31:35.020]
They never win, they never will.

[02:31:35.220 --> 02:31:36.920]
And I will never know.

[02:31:37.180 --> 02:31:39.280]
Vice-Portilla straight it picked them.

[02:31:39.660 --> 02:31:41.800]
To win the Super Bowl in there.

[02:31:42.200 --> 02:31:43.680]
The Miami Dolphins.

[02:31:44.560 --> 02:31:46.500]
Miami Dolphins.

[02:31:46.660 --> 02:31:48.620]
Miami Dolphins number.

[02:31:48.900 --> 02:31:50.240]
How many jeans in the league?

[02:31:50.340 --> 02:31:51.000]
But it's you.

[02:31:51.360 --> 02:31:53.120]
Miami Dolphins.

[02:31:53.580 --> 02:31:54.680]
Miami Dolphins.

[02:31:54.680 --> 02:31:58.600]
The same old story nothing new.

[02:32:01.500 --> 02:32:03.800]
The Dolphins are such losers.

[02:32:04.120 --> 02:32:05.900]
They really are quite lame.

[02:32:06.360 --> 02:32:08.540]
I knew it from the fairy start.

[02:32:08.800 --> 02:32:10.340]
I watched a Pittsburgh game.

[02:32:10.820 --> 02:32:13.080]
And did you see the wimpy wave?

[02:32:13.300 --> 02:32:14.820]
It's saving through that flag.

[02:32:15.420 --> 02:32:17.340]
Standing on the sidelines.

[02:32:17.600 --> 02:32:19.820]
He looked just like a fag in there.

[02:32:19.960 --> 02:32:22.180]
The fair Miami Dolphins.

[02:32:22.180 --> 02:32:24.600]
Miami Dolphins.

[02:32:24.660 --> 02:32:26.700]
Miami Dolphins number.

[02:32:26.940 --> 02:32:28.220]
How many jeans in the league?

[02:32:28.220 --> 02:32:29.020]
Thirty-two.

[02:32:29.420 --> 02:32:31.200]
Miami Dolphins.

[02:32:31.620 --> 02:32:33.480]
Miami Dolphins.

[02:32:33.600 --> 02:32:36.300]
They're problems stick to them like glue.

[02:32:39.800 --> 02:32:43.820]
The dolphins lost a buffalo and then he can't see.

[02:32:44.320 --> 02:32:48.120]
It's only by sure what they pulled out of victory.

[02:32:49.120 --> 02:32:50.920]
And then they played the Texans.

[02:32:51.320 --> 02:32:52.900]
It almost made me sick.

[02:32:53.280 --> 02:32:55.300]
That stupid two-point pass play.

[02:32:55.740 --> 02:32:57.880]
That fumbling on site kicked in there.

[02:32:58.320 --> 02:33:00.200]
The Miami Dolphins.

[02:33:00.640 --> 02:33:02.460]
Miami Dolphins.

[02:33:02.800 --> 02:33:04.680]
Miami Dolphins number.

[02:33:04.980 --> 02:33:06.000]
How many jeans in the league?

[02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:06.580]
Thirty-two.

[02:33:07.440 --> 02:33:09.140]
Miami Dolphins.

[02:33:09.660 --> 02:33:11.500]
Miami Dolphins.

[02:33:11.940 --> 02:33:13.180]
Old and no-marring.

[02:33:13.400 --> 02:33:14.100]
It's no shoes.

[02:33:18.120 --> 02:33:20.260]
But dolphins can't control the ball.

[02:33:20.400 --> 02:33:20.960]
They're running.

[02:33:21.240 --> 02:33:21.920]
Game is flat.

[02:33:22.240 --> 02:33:24.160]
As for their execution.

[02:33:24.780 --> 02:33:26.420]
Well, I'd agree with that.

[02:33:26.840 --> 02:33:28.620]
They're always gone up low.

[02:33:28.920 --> 02:33:30.880]
A lead of that, you can be sure.

[02:33:31.280 --> 02:33:35.380]
And when they lead the field so have the stench of common door.

[02:33:35.680 --> 02:33:38.320]
And they're the Miami Dolphins.

[02:33:38.800 --> 02:33:40.600]
Miami Dolphins.

[02:33:40.800 --> 02:33:42.760]
Miami Dolphins number.

[02:33:43.040 --> 02:33:44.300]
How many jeans in the league?

[02:33:45.660 --> 02:33:47.260]
Miami Dolphins.

[02:33:47.400 --> 02:33:49.540]
Miami Dolphins.

[02:33:49.760 --> 02:33:53.700]
Give them another shot of boo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

[02:33:53.800 --> 02:33:53.800]

[02:33:54.540 --> 02:33:55.480]
You'll stop!

[02:33:56.120 --> 02:33:57.920]
But dolphins have no strategy.

[02:33:58.440 --> 02:33:59.840]
They play like idiots.

[02:34:00.500 --> 02:34:04.520]
Another couple games watched in the Patriots and Jets.

[02:34:04.980 --> 02:34:06.840]
I think they're all retarded.

[02:34:07.340 --> 02:34:09.020]
It's almost like their curse.

[02:34:09.980 --> 02:34:11.840]
Ascasyntaylor and sectamus.

[02:34:11.840 --> 02:34:14.480]
Which team is the worst in their safe?

[02:34:14.660 --> 02:34:16.300]
Miami Dolphins.

[02:34:16.440 --> 02:34:18.680]
Miami Dolphins.

[02:34:18.720 --> 02:34:20.760]
Miami Dolphins number.

[02:34:21.080 --> 02:34:22.640]
What the hell, 32?

[02:34:23.600 --> 02:34:25.280]
Miami Dolphins.

[02:34:25.480 --> 02:34:27.680]
Miami Dolphins.

[02:34:28.280 --> 02:34:30.940]
Miami Dolphins.

[02:34:31.120 --> 02:34:34.080]
Now they're brewed.

[02:34:40.080 --> 02:34:40.440]
Miami Dolphins.

[02:34:40.440 --> 02:34:40.440]

[02:34:40.440 --> 02:34:41.580]
I hear so damn negative, Neil.

[02:34:41.580 --> 02:34:42.740]
Why can't you jump onto bandwagon?

[02:34:42.800 --> 02:34:48.160]
They're going to win a Super Bowl and they're kicking ass in the saving areas back on track and yaddy-addy.

[02:34:48.220 --> 02:34:49.000]
Anybody believe that?

[02:34:49.060 --> 02:34:49.180]
No.

[02:34:49.280 --> 02:34:49.900]
No, I don't need her.

[02:34:50.220 --> 02:34:50.820]
I think they suck.

[02:34:51.400 --> 02:34:54.860]
A new board baby boy was left this morning at a fire station in Lauderdale, according to police.

[02:34:55.140 --> 02:34:55.760]
There you go, George.

[02:34:55.820 --> 02:34:56.660]
There's a chance for a boy.

[02:34:56.780 --> 02:34:58.380]
You have two girls who has a chance for a little boy.

[02:34:58.640 --> 02:34:58.860]
I'm good.

[02:34:58.860 --> 02:34:59.480]
Thanks.

[02:35:00.020 --> 02:35:09.200]
The baby who appeared to be about just two days old was left about 634 in front of fire station number 14 at 791 Northwest 31st and police lieutenant Tundra King's head.

[02:35:09.440 --> 02:35:12.020]
The station is run by the VSO Fire Rescue Department.

[02:35:12.320 --> 02:35:15.060]
The baby was in good condition thanks God and wrapped in a blanket.

[02:35:15.500 --> 02:35:16.420]
Well, maybe it was cold in there.

[02:35:16.440 --> 02:35:17.700]
I'd like to warm it up in the microwave.

[02:35:18.480 --> 02:35:19.520]
Just kidding now.

[02:35:19.640 --> 02:35:20.260]
Just kidding.

[02:35:20.400 --> 02:35:20.620]
Okay.

[02:35:20.820 --> 02:35:22.320]
There he is being insensitive again.

[02:35:22.380 --> 02:35:23.880]
He doesn't like Dolphins and he hates babies.

[02:35:24.100 --> 02:35:26.360]
He's like WC freaking fields without the Estobi.

[02:35:26.480 --> 02:35:26.840]
What do you think?

[02:35:27.020 --> 02:35:27.500]
30 seconds.

[02:35:27.500 --> 02:35:30.220]
No, I wish I could have a Stobi.

[02:35:30.320 --> 02:35:31.080]
I love my Stobi.

[02:35:31.200 --> 02:35:31.660]
I miss that.

[02:35:31.840 --> 02:35:32.560]
But I quit him.

[02:35:32.900 --> 02:35:36.200]
I quit smoking Stobi's man because it's put me in an early grave.

[02:35:36.860 --> 02:35:40.760]
Now if I quit eating so much crap, although I do sit in that room in Sandwich Center really, really good.

[02:35:41.560 --> 02:35:43.600]
Police contacted us and see how easy I am.

[02:35:43.780 --> 02:35:45.060]
I'm just, I'm a wreck.

[02:35:45.240 --> 02:35:46.500]
All my life, I've been so easily.

[02:35:46.740 --> 02:35:47.800]
It's just like sales resistance.

[02:35:48.040 --> 02:35:48.560]
I don't have any.

[02:35:48.880 --> 02:35:50.440]
Like those infomercials I buy that stuff.

[02:35:50.580 --> 02:35:52.040]
Luckily though lately, knock on wood.

[02:35:52.340 --> 02:35:53.360]
But there's the knock on my door.

[02:35:54.200 --> 02:35:56.500]
I've been buying some good stuff like that GT Express.

[02:35:57.100 --> 02:36:00.860]
And I discovered that if you cook the omelettes long enough, the stuff doesn't stick in the O'Wells.

[02:36:00.880 --> 02:36:01.160]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:36:01.280 --> 02:36:01.860]
Well, well, well.

[02:36:02.140 --> 02:36:02.920]
Doesn't stick in there.

[02:36:03.180 --> 02:36:04.900]
I say, I've cooked them long enough, like 8, 8 and a half minutes.

[02:36:05.220 --> 02:36:05.800]
Not a problem.

[02:36:06.400 --> 02:36:07.280]
I'm an omelette man.

[02:36:07.600 --> 02:36:08.240]
So what should I do?

[02:36:08.340 --> 02:36:10.820]
Have an omelette for lunch or go to a restaurant and get a Rubens sandwich.

[02:36:10.900 --> 02:36:11.240]
There's your problem.

[02:36:11.240 --> 02:36:11.840]
They have an omelette.

[02:36:12.540 --> 02:36:12.820]
Absolutely.

[02:36:12.940 --> 02:36:14.340]
Keep my weight loss going in the right direction.

[02:36:15.140 --> 02:36:16.960]
Because you know what Saturday is? It's WS.

[02:36:17.980 --> 02:36:18.500]
Woodbind Saturday?

[02:36:18.860 --> 02:36:19.060]
Yeah.

[02:36:20.360 --> 02:36:23.340]
I'm glad that the parents or mom or dad took the child there, King said.

[02:36:23.800 --> 02:36:25.480]
They wanted someone to find it safe.

[02:36:25.780 --> 02:36:26.720]
And that's what appears to happen.

[02:36:27.200 --> 02:36:28.940]
This was when the baby was taking the plantation general.

[02:36:29.340 --> 02:36:31.980]
At least they didn't put in a trash can or a dumpster or something like that.

[02:36:32.260 --> 02:36:33.400]
The parents were not face charges.

[02:36:33.640 --> 02:36:36.760]
King said, under Florida's Safe Haven law, a parent can...

[02:36:36.760 --> 02:36:38.160]
Well, what kind of a law is this?

[02:36:38.520 --> 02:36:41.520]
A parent can honestly drop off a newborn within three days of birth

[02:36:41.520 --> 02:36:46.480]
at any fire station or hospital without facing charges, as long as the child shows no sign of abuse.

[02:36:46.800 --> 02:36:48.200]
But I wish you knew about that law, George.

[02:36:48.680 --> 02:36:49.320]
I did.

[02:36:49.680 --> 02:36:50.300]
You didn't know?

[02:36:50.720 --> 02:36:51.720]
I don't make my problem.

[02:36:51.720 --> 02:36:52.560]
Other people's problems.

[02:36:56.300 --> 02:36:58.820]
It's just that other people make their problems.

[02:36:58.900 --> 02:36:59.760]
Your problem's yeah well.

[02:36:59.760 --> 02:37:01.060]
I shouldn't go the other way.

[02:37:01.260 --> 02:37:01.980]
I have to wear a coat.

[02:37:02.020 --> 02:37:03.460]
I take care of my baby if you didn't go the other way.

[02:37:03.560 --> 02:37:04.860]
It would have been a different kind of life.

[02:37:04.960 --> 02:37:05.400]
But not simply.

[02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:06.560]
What's for me?

[02:37:06.980 --> 02:37:07.900]
Works really well for me.

[02:37:08.840 --> 02:37:10.460]
And my friend Jacob said he doesn't care.

[02:37:11.080 --> 02:37:13.100]
He's open-minded, but not that open-minded.

[02:37:13.760 --> 02:37:14.860]
1352 votes on the pool.

[02:37:14.980 --> 02:37:16.380]
Rick Shaw is retiring.

[02:37:16.800 --> 02:37:19.280]
By the way, the Sunsettled just discovered today that Rick Shaw is retiring.

[02:37:19.560 --> 02:37:22.140]
And that President Lincoln's got a bad headache and president Garfield got shot.

[02:37:22.140 --> 02:37:23.980]
Other than that, everything is hunky-dory.

[02:37:24.560 --> 02:37:25.200]
Rick Shaw's retiring.

[02:37:25.200 --> 02:37:26.100]
One should kneel retire.

[02:37:26.260 --> 02:37:26.860]
It's a nifty pool.

[02:37:27.240 --> 02:37:27.880]
The one for tomorrow.

[02:37:28.080 --> 02:37:29.140]
And now which one should I use for tomorrow?

[02:37:29.240 --> 02:37:30.800]
The one about real men don't throw a what?

[02:37:31.160 --> 02:37:33.800]
In fact, tomorrow I think is George Rodriguez Friday, isn't it?

[02:37:34.260 --> 02:37:34.580]
Oh yeah.

[02:37:35.840 --> 02:37:37.180]
Now, when are we going to start that?

[02:37:37.240 --> 02:37:38.620]
I think we're going to start that really soon.

[02:37:38.860 --> 02:37:39.920]
One day through Thursday sounds like,

[02:37:40.120 --> 02:37:41.400]
then it could be WF tomorrow.

[02:37:42.480 --> 02:37:42.840]
WF?

[02:37:42.980 --> 02:37:43.580]
Oh, Woodbine Friday.

[02:37:43.860 --> 02:37:44.060]
Yeah.

[02:37:44.500 --> 02:37:45.880]
Maybe I'll find me a good machine mine.

[02:37:46.260 --> 02:37:48.120]
I think I got to start going to the five dollar machine.

[02:37:48.520 --> 02:37:49.060]
There's a little.

[02:37:49.660 --> 02:37:49.800]
Huh?

[02:37:49.800 --> 02:37:52.900]
Well, you play longer on, well, I don't know how that works actually.

[02:37:53.240 --> 02:37:54.640]
No, you play longer in the dollar machine.

[02:37:54.840 --> 02:37:55.440]
That's correct.

[02:37:55.840 --> 02:37:57.920]
The smaller the nomination, the longer you're going to play.

[02:37:58.180 --> 02:38:00.120]
Although these quarter machines are the digital ones,

[02:38:00.360 --> 02:38:03.780]
we can play like up to like 40 coins or whatever, like every time you're playing,

[02:38:03.880 --> 02:38:04.620]
you play like 10 bucks.

[02:38:04.840 --> 02:38:05.580]
You know, it's just crazy.

[02:38:05.860 --> 02:38:06.640]
But it's only quarters.

[02:38:07.100 --> 02:38:07.720]
Yeah, I see.

[02:38:08.240 --> 02:38:10.000]
See, when you add up a whole bunch of quarters together,

[02:38:10.100 --> 02:38:11.700]
it turns out to be like a serious amount of money.

[02:38:11.800 --> 02:38:14.440]
But nevertheless, here comes the bunny and there goes your money.

[02:38:15.160 --> 02:38:15.960]
Rick Shaw's retiring.

[02:38:16.140 --> 02:38:17.020]
When should kneel retire?

[02:38:17.180 --> 02:38:19.440]
We're asking the audience as if we need to care what your opinion is.

[02:38:19.440 --> 02:38:20.020]
And we don't.

[02:38:20.240 --> 02:38:23.940]
Whenever he feels like it's 636, 47%.

[02:38:23.940 --> 02:38:25.760]
Never 557.

[02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:27.380]
We could never live without this show.

[02:38:27.540 --> 02:38:28.880]
We don't want to call him and we don't want to like,

[02:38:28.880 --> 02:38:30.260]
we don't can't stand those bedtime stories.

[02:38:30.460 --> 02:38:32.440]
We just want to leave him there like in a catch 22.

[02:38:33.040 --> 02:38:33.520]
And we hate him.

[02:38:33.840 --> 02:38:34.980]
But no, that's right.

[02:38:36.020 --> 02:38:36.740]
Never 557.

[02:38:36.880 --> 02:38:38.080]
That's 41.1%.

[02:38:38.080 --> 02:38:38.820]
You put those together.

[02:38:38.820 --> 02:38:39.440]
You got like 88%.

[02:38:40.060 --> 02:38:42.020]
What a self-serving rotten pool this is.

[02:38:42.440 --> 02:38:44.100]
And if there's one thing I cannot stand it said,

[02:38:44.440 --> 02:38:47.640]
kissy, kissy, kissy, all the pen and course on who's doing the kissy, kissy, kissy.

[02:38:47.640 --> 02:38:50.120]
If I'm doing it, you know, somebody pretty damn good.

[02:38:50.320 --> 02:38:53.880]
Now, let's see, now, retire right now, 80.5.9%.

[02:38:53.880 --> 02:38:55.940]
It's bubbling under that 6% total.

[02:38:56.260 --> 02:38:58.160]
It gets to 6% for it's really dangerous.

[02:38:58.360 --> 02:39:00.060]
Then that means you've lost contact with your audience.

[02:39:00.300 --> 02:39:01.080]
They want you out.

[02:39:01.420 --> 02:39:02.340]
They want George on.

[02:39:02.580 --> 02:39:03.920]
Now, an area I hate.

[02:39:04.320 --> 02:39:05.440]
What are you laughing about?

[02:39:05.580 --> 02:39:07.100]
You've got your followers out there.

[02:39:07.380 --> 02:39:09.620]
Those living and breathing punks, you want to know where to buy some good weed?

[02:39:10.140 --> 02:39:10.940]
I was, I did.

[02:39:11.340 --> 02:39:16.660]
In a few years, 48, I hate this pool 18 only 1.3% and soon 16.

[02:39:16.660 --> 02:39:19.500]
Whatever that is, 1.1% say we're gonna have to say it soon.

[02:39:20.420 --> 02:39:21.060]
13.55.

[02:39:21.300 --> 02:39:22.320]
Pretty good total on there.

[02:39:22.440 --> 02:39:24.620]
All of the listeners online, they are way down.

[02:39:25.060 --> 02:39:25.400]
Way down.

[02:39:25.500 --> 02:39:26.040]
And you wonder why?

[02:39:26.120 --> 02:39:27.360]
Because your calls have sucked today.

[02:39:27.640 --> 02:39:28.760]
They haven't been a lot of number one.

[02:39:29.040 --> 02:39:32.880]
And number two, the ones we put on here, most of them I wouldn't wish on Heinrich Himmler and Joyce Fitch.

[02:39:33.080 --> 02:39:33.620]
How do you like that?

[02:39:33.760 --> 02:39:35.160]
Ooh, that's right.

[02:39:35.300 --> 02:39:35.880]
That's the aim of that.

[02:39:35.880 --> 02:39:36.480]
That's the aim of all.

[02:39:36.520 --> 02:39:37.180]
Or George Bush.

[02:39:37.520 --> 02:39:38.900]
I wouldn't wish him on Condom Plesa.

[02:39:39.440 --> 02:39:42.960]
I wouldn't wish him on Heinrich Himmler, where the hell he is.

[02:39:43.620 --> 02:39:46.620]
By the way, you see about that Russian guy got that, Ruski got poisoned again.

[02:39:46.940 --> 02:39:47.680]
They're really good at that.

[02:39:47.820 --> 02:39:47.900]
You know?

[02:39:48.160 --> 02:39:48.480]
Yeah, they're.

[02:39:48.720 --> 02:39:49.700]
Practice makes perfect.

[02:39:49.960 --> 02:39:51.740]
I wonder if they're poisoning Josh's vodka.

[02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:59.080]
The biggest name of the best talent to the business, me or Rogers, for 20 or 60, is UAM.

[02:40:02.500 --> 02:40:06.340]
Forks for your radio is what the Q4 UAM.

[02:40:07.060 --> 02:40:07.640]
That's the movie.

[02:40:09.480 --> 02:40:10.640]
Forks are strange.

[02:40:11.840 --> 02:40:12.640]
They're never happy.

[02:40:13.740 --> 02:40:14.920]
They're never getting made.

[02:40:15.140 --> 02:40:16.720]
That's a whole motor low.

[02:40:37.640 --> 02:40:37.640]

[02:41:00.480 --> 02:41:01.140]
ufu, ok.

[02:41:01.140 --> 02:41:02.000]
Amiga Fitch.

[02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:03.460]
But if it's a real idaka of the thing, causehetia is a böyle custard, habituatorian,

[02:41:03.460 --> 02:41:05.180]
old Businessman gets things off.

[02:41:05.180 --> 02:41:07.520]
From there your life starts to oneway or you start to budgie all the time.

[02:41:11.920 --> 02:41:14.100]
I'm a kid.

[02:41:14.380 --> 02:41:18.080]
I'm a kid.

[02:41:18.080 --> 02:41:37.500]
I'm a kid.

[02:41:37.520 --> 02:41:41.080]
No tricks.

[02:42:24.220 --> 02:42:29.880]
No tricks.

[02:43:06.980 --> 02:43:07.080]
I'm a kid.

[02:43:07.520 --> 02:43:21.620]
I'm a kid.

[02:43:37.520 --> 02:43:39.260]
I'm a kid.

[02:44:07.520 --> 02:44:12.220]
I'm a kid.

[02:44:37.520 --> 02:45:05.680]
I'm a kid.

[02:45:07.520 --> 02:45:09.980]
I'm a kid.

[02:45:43.560 --> 02:46:07.480]
I'm a kid.

[02:46:14.860 --> 02:46:17.080]
I'm a kid.

[02:46:17.080 --> 02:46:17.080]

[02:46:17.080 --> 02:46:17.080]

[02:46:17.080 --> 02:46:17.080]

[02:46:17.080 --> 02:46:17.080]

[02:46:17.080 --> 02:46:17.080]

[02:46:17.080 --> 02:46:17.080]

[02:46:17.080 --> 02:46:17.200]
I'm a kid.

[02:46:17.620 --> 02:46:18.020]
I'm a kid.

[02:46:18.020 --> 02:46:19.960]
I'm a kid.

[02:46:19.960 --> 02:46:20.600]
I'm a kid.

[02:46:21.480 --> 02:46:23.160]
I'm a kid.

[02:46:23.980 --> 02:46:26.940]
I'm a kid.

[02:46:29.100 --> 02:46:35.520]
I'm a kid.

[02:46:35.520 --> 02:46:36.600]
Oh, fantastic.

[02:46:36.860 --> 02:46:38.580]
Well, Neil, you've got to play that.

[02:46:40.040 --> 02:46:40.880]
I've got to play that.

[02:46:40.880 --> 02:46:42.060]
I've got to play that.

[02:46:42.560 --> 02:46:43.420]
I've got to play that.

[02:46:44.500 --> 02:46:45.520]
I've got to play that.

[02:46:45.520 --> 02:46:46.600]
I've got to play that.

[02:46:46.620 --> 02:46:47.900]
That is absolutely correct.

[02:46:48.020 --> 02:46:49.920]
That's pretty cool.

[02:46:50.480 --> 02:46:50.740]
That's it.

[02:46:50.880 --> 02:46:50.960]
That's it.

[02:46:50.960 --> 02:46:51.840]
I thought we were going to know Thanksgiving.

[02:46:54.400 --> 02:47:03.520]
That's pretty cool.

[02:47:03.520 --> 02:47:05.200]
and Salah meditation speaking of Isle,

[02:47:05.340 --> 02:47:07.280]
and one of Turkey's most famous mosques today,

[02:47:07.680 --> 02:47:09.580]
in a drama, and it's chopped off.

[02:47:09.860 --> 02:47:11.600]
The Potter's remarks linking violence and the teachings,

[02:47:12.080 --> 02:47:14.720]
in a dramatic aftermath, I guess, in dramatic something.

[02:47:15.180 --> 02:47:16.520]
About actually made those nasty,

[02:47:16.700 --> 02:47:18.360]
but very true comments about the Prophet Muhammad,

[02:47:18.720 --> 02:47:20.480]
and about that gutter religion of Islam,

[02:47:20.660 --> 02:47:23.640]
and about all the violence and stuff, like Catholicism.

[02:47:24.020 --> 02:47:25.640]
The proper company by Islam, at cleric,

[02:47:25.700 --> 02:47:26.780]
bowed his head for nearly a minute

[02:47:26.780 --> 02:47:28.840]
inside the 17th century blue mosque,

[02:47:29.240 --> 02:47:31.620]
and only the second visit, as predecessor,

[02:47:31.620 --> 02:47:34.420]
John Paul II visited a mosque in Syria in 2001.

[02:47:34.740 --> 02:47:36.580]
The mosque visit was added to Benedict Schedgerl

[02:47:36.580 --> 02:47:38.620]
as a sign of respect during his first

[02:47:38.620 --> 02:47:39.940]
papal trip to a Muslim nation.

[02:47:40.220 --> 02:47:42.300]
He removed his shoes, his little red shoes,

[02:47:42.300 --> 02:47:43.180]
he took them off.

[02:47:43.460 --> 02:47:44.500]
On his look, there's the old Pope.

[02:47:44.680 --> 02:47:47.720]
Really more than 100 years, more than 150 years.

[02:47:47.720 --> 02:47:48.700]
Are you watching that in CNN?

[02:47:48.880 --> 02:47:51.280]
Muslim Christian in the mission field.

[02:47:51.820 --> 02:47:52.400]
Did you see that?

[02:47:52.480 --> 02:47:54.420]
He was like nodded off, he was like dying over there.

[02:47:54.560 --> 02:47:55.200]
Is somebody, did you see that?

[02:47:55.400 --> 02:47:55.800]
No, I didn't.

[02:47:55.940 --> 02:47:57.260]
He was like, I don't know, past that.

[02:47:57.280 --> 02:47:57.580]
That's hope.

[02:47:58.120 --> 02:47:59.220]
Now that's the old one.

[02:47:59.400 --> 02:48:00.440]
He's always the Islam on Islam.

[02:48:00.440 --> 02:48:02.580]
He did one of his left-room on all over our Rome.

[02:48:03.200 --> 02:48:04.960]
I tell you one thing, there's plenty of shluckers in Rome,

[02:48:05.120 --> 02:48:06.060]
make no mistake about that.

[02:48:06.360 --> 02:48:07.380]
I'd even actually at Rome,

[02:48:07.440 --> 02:48:08.880]
a boy you would sure like it there.

[02:48:08.980 --> 02:48:10.220]
Man, that is really someplace.

[02:48:10.880 --> 02:48:11.080]
Whoa.

[02:48:11.820 --> 02:48:14.140]
The Pope removed his shoes before entering the carpet

[02:48:14.140 --> 02:48:15.120]
and expands into the mosque,

[02:48:15.560 --> 02:48:18.360]
which is officially known as the Sultan Ahmed Mosque,

[02:48:18.380 --> 02:48:19.080]
something or other.

[02:48:19.280 --> 02:48:20.440]
But it's why they called a blue mosque

[02:48:20.440 --> 02:48:21.800]
after it's delivered blue tiles.

[02:48:22.900 --> 02:48:24.620]
The Pope has offered wide-ranging messages

[02:48:24.620 --> 02:48:26.860]
of reconciliation to Muslims since arriving in Turkey

[02:48:26.860 --> 02:48:28.960]
on Tuesday, including appeals for something

[02:48:28.960 --> 02:48:29.760]
which has chopped off,

[02:48:30.020 --> 02:48:32.060]
become the first Muslim nation in the European Union.

[02:48:32.880 --> 02:48:34.980]
But Benedict has also said down his own demands

[02:48:35.520 --> 02:48:37.520]
after a deeply symbolic display of unity

[02:48:37.520 --> 02:48:40.660]
with the ecumenical patriarch Bartholomew I,

[02:48:41.080 --> 02:48:42.720]
the spiritual leader of the world's Christian Orthodox.

[02:48:43.880 --> 02:48:44.740]
I can't read it.

[02:48:45.220 --> 02:48:46.980]
He said, the divisions among Christians

[02:48:46.980 --> 02:48:48.400]
are a scandal to the world.

[02:48:48.980 --> 02:48:49.520]
How do you like that?

[02:48:49.820 --> 02:48:50.220]
A scandal to rule,

[02:48:50.300 --> 02:48:52.660]
like all those Catholic priests molesting all those young boys,

[02:48:52.980 --> 02:48:53.880]
a scandal to the world.

[02:48:53.900 --> 02:48:56.320]
If anybody out-of-know-what scandal, it's El Papa.

[02:48:56.620 --> 02:48:58.520]
The biggest name, so best.

[02:48:58.520 --> 02:48:59.020]
El Papa.

[02:48:59.440 --> 02:49:00.660]
This is Neil Rogers.

[02:49:01.180 --> 02:49:02.840]
How long are you 5'60s?

[02:49:03.060 --> 02:49:03.700]
You A-Mam.

[02:49:06.740 --> 02:49:07.800]
It's day-

[02:49:07.800 --> 02:49:09.460]
Oh, if I ever tell,

[02:49:09.960 --> 02:49:12.720]
if you ever have 5'60s,

[02:49:13.540 --> 02:49:14.060]
WQA.

[02:49:14.300 --> 02:49:14.300]

[02:49:18.680 --> 02:49:18.680]

[02:49:18.680 --> 02:49:18.680]

[02:49:21.960 --> 02:49:23.320]
It's been worked for my internship

[02:49:23.320 --> 02:49:24.740]
at the Euridings and Dian.

[02:49:24.920 --> 02:49:25.220]
And how?

[02:49:26.240 --> 02:49:28.200]
Well, I don't want to show you what a fake ass

[02:49:28.200 --> 02:49:29.580]
said I was for your hand.

[02:49:29.680 --> 02:49:29.820]
How?

[02:49:30.440 --> 02:49:32.380]
You said, don't you get quite somebody good enough

[02:49:32.380 --> 02:49:33.620]
to fill my baggy pants?

[02:49:34.640 --> 02:49:35.540]
It ain't easy.

[02:49:39.260 --> 02:49:41.520]
There ain't no chance I'll have to be coming back.

[02:49:43.540 --> 02:49:44.840]
I've tried to keep peddling a look

[02:49:44.840 --> 02:49:45.560]
where it isn't comfortable.

[02:49:47.240 --> 02:49:48.980]
If you want to know what it'll save you

[02:49:48.980 --> 02:49:50.620]
from shutting that transmitted to ground,

[02:49:50.960 --> 02:49:51.020]
you should.

[02:49:51.600 --> 02:49:52.660]
Why, that's easy.

[02:49:55.440 --> 02:49:55.840]
Sure.

[02:49:55.840 --> 02:49:56.360]
What?

[02:49:56.740 --> 02:49:58.480]
Oh, you need it, small.

[02:49:59.720 --> 02:49:59.920]
What?

[02:50:00.120 --> 02:50:00.220]
What?

[02:50:01.140 --> 02:50:03.220]
Oh, you need it, small.

[02:50:04.280 --> 02:50:05.540]
I'm out of that, boy.

[02:50:06.120 --> 02:50:08.060]
Oh, you need it, the show.

[02:50:08.460 --> 02:50:09.260]
It won't flow.

[02:50:10.380 --> 02:50:11.020]
What?

[02:50:11.280 --> 02:50:11.280]

[02:50:11.440 --> 02:50:11.440]

[02:50:13.680 --> 02:50:15.540]
I mean, your old claims last

[02:50:15.540 --> 02:50:16.800]
only got you today.

[02:50:17.340 --> 02:50:17.500]
What?

[02:50:18.140 --> 02:50:19.760]
The state that my ratings that

[02:50:19.760 --> 02:50:21.200]
bottomed out in this game.

[02:50:21.740 --> 02:50:21.880]
What?

[02:50:22.520 --> 02:50:23.760]
Which video has a reward for me?

[02:50:23.760 --> 02:50:25.820]
It's the one that I gave him a reward.

[02:50:26.340 --> 02:50:28.580]
And we did.

[02:50:30.620 --> 02:50:31.120]
What?

[02:50:31.120 --> 02:50:32.800]
Oh, you need it, small.

[02:50:33.480 --> 02:50:35.040]
Sound, drinking, and cigarettes.

[02:50:35.720 --> 02:50:35.860]
What?

[02:50:36.180 --> 02:50:37.380]
You need it, small.

[02:50:38.040 --> 02:50:39.200]
And I'm out of that, baby.

[02:50:39.940 --> 02:50:42.080]
Oh, you need it, the show.

[02:50:42.400 --> 02:50:43.160]
It won't flow.

[02:50:44.280 --> 02:50:44.680]
What?

[02:50:44.720 --> 02:50:45.180]
What?

[02:50:45.280 --> 02:50:45.360]
What?

[02:50:45.440 --> 02:50:45.440]

[02:50:47.440 --> 02:50:49.180]
You have a bite of weight, something.

[02:50:49.560 --> 02:50:49.980]
It's just.

[02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:51.060]
I told you to give me this.

[02:50:51.260 --> 02:50:51.840]
It's easy.

[02:50:51.840 --> 02:50:52.360]
No!

[02:50:53.200 --> 02:50:55.120]
Are you going to go find me?

[02:50:55.640 --> 02:50:56.460]
I go find.

[02:50:57.140 --> 02:50:58.160]
Round about that.

[02:50:58.580 --> 02:50:59.460]
I'm lost.

[02:50:59.700 --> 02:51:00.560]
Bye, bye, bye.
