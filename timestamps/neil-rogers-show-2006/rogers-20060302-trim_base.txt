[00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.780]
I think of what?

[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:03.680]
I don't know.

[00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.980]
What do you say?

[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:05.760]
I ain't saying it.

[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.320]
What do you say, Bobby?

[00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.400]
No, that's not what I just heard.

[00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.100]
I heard something about Mother's Day.

[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.760]
You better watch it, Mr.

[00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.860]
because I just found out I had a very unsatisfactory morning sitting here this morning.

[00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.860]
What's the matter now?

[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.940]
Would you new general manager with this new regime?

[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.480]
You know, the only thing I always say about the don't wish for something because it's through.

[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.440]
The head of the czar.

[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.700]
As bad as it was before, you may think, you know, in other words, be satisfied with what it is

[00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.960]
because at least you know what it is.

[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.880]
Yeah, you're protege that I talked to you about yesterday, your junior program director.

[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.320]
He's gone off the deep end.

[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.580]
First, he evidently booked the wrong flight on the wrong day.

[00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.300]
So he showed up halfway to the basketball game yesterday because his flight on Tuesday,

[00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.640]
there was no flight because he had booked for yesterday.

[00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.700]
He was at the game I saw him on television.

[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.340]
Halfway through the game, he showed up or an hour into it.

[00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.820]
No, he was there for the game.

[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.560]
Well, getting that information on.

[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.980]
Yes you are.

[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.340]
Regardless of that.

[00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.720]
Whatever.

[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.560]
He's the new sensor now.

[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.840]
He's the beastly sensor board.

[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.900]
And so the stuff, it's not bad enough that we had our hands tied behind our back before.

[00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.540]
Before the new regime came in.

[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.360]
Now we also have an apple in our mouth.

[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.640]
So, you know, you get your hands tied behind your back.

[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.160]
You have an apple.

[00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.220]
Happy 30th anniversary, Neil.

[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.380]
And by the way, FU.

[00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.320]
Ah, there you go.

[00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.620]
Right there.

[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.540]
Now these guys are a joke.

[00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.320]
I thought you'd make it the 35 I said today.

[00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.800]
What?

[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.600]
Not with this crowd.

[00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.440]
Not with these people who got running this place now.

[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.060]
Paper tiger.

[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.020]
Do you know what that term means?

[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.720]
Paper tiger.

[00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.000]
Yep.

[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.940]
That's what we got.

[00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.640]
At any rate, want to correct something.

[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.280]
They held brody a correction because they wouldn't like to get it right once in a while anyway.

[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.600]
I was told today I'm not allowed to criticize the herald anymore.

[00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.860]
Guess what?

[00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.200]
Screw them.

[00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.220]
I will not pay attention to that.

[00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.040]
Who told you that?

[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.660]
This is where they tried to dump me because I said something about their ridiculous sports section.

[00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.160]
See, that's part of what I'm telling you about.

[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.540]
I know.

[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.840]
I mean, listen, I'm at the point now after 30 years.

[00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.320]
I might just play music every day.

[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.860]
If that's what they want.

[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.900]
If that's their idea of what this station wants to be.

[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.440]
So I can play all sports songs.

[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.720]
When the cowardly station were afraid of our own shadow.

[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.100]
If that's the idea of what Joe Bell thinks of QA and that we got some real problems, baby.

[00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.340]
I'll play all sports songs.

[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.140]
Yeah, there you go.

[00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.840]
I'll play all the yes and marches.

[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.680]
Marches and marches.

[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.860]
Yeah.

[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.620]
I'll start with yours.

[00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:31.460]
That's a nice thing.

[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.020]
Yeah.

[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.120]
Little MSU in the banks of the Red Sea.

[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.500]
Oh, yeah.

[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.560]
I had some great lyrics for those songs in the old days.

[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.780]
They weren't going to use them now.

[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.920]
No, they were afraid of our own shadow.

[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:47.820]
We went to public to note.

[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:48.100]
Okay.

[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.700]

iml�ing day I think I have�� years

[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:22.560]
• Today is the most demeralising day I think Iheid finish years

[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.140]
• It is like you ty talk about getting

[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.480]
率tmedledz

[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.300]

[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:26.540]
its ridiculous

[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.760]

a latenter

[00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:31.380]

• Age marks

[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.880]
cross that imaginary line because we're going to get fined and say it's not even close

[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.420]
to that line. But then again, what would I know about it? I know I've been doing this

[00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.920]
for like a hundred years. I mean, you know, when you've got a move in like clearance

[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:46.840]
in the beastlies, they're the ones who are going to decide. Now, seriously, this new guy,

[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:51.120]
he just, you know, I take back what I said about Kevin Baxter. Remember, I said that first

[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:57.180]
line in the article was over the top of what I hate the management. Yeah. I said, well,

[00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.640]
that's not right. That was the previous management. No, he's right. When you work for other people,

[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:06.420]
it's always the same. It's the faces change, the method changes, you know, the glad hand.

[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:10.620]
Oh, you're so great. But in the bottom line is they still stick it to you every chance

[00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:14.640]
to get. I'm going to win that damn lotto. It's up to nine million for a setter. I'm going

[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:21.680]
to win a lot and just get out of this. Just tell these people to screw off. Look at this.

[00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:28.640]
Here's the facts from a Michigan State alum, wishing me happy anniversary. That incredible?

[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:34.060]
From a M S U alum says he listens on the internet. So I wonder where this person is. Where is

[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:41.540]
the 205 area code? Does anybody know 205? Never heard of it. He says he used two words that

[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:45.980]
have always been curious to their definition. I've tried looking, I'm looking up at the

[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:50.300]
picture and everybody will find them. They're pronounced farbicina. Well, that's a Yiddish word.

[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:54.200]
You'll find that in the Yiddish dictionary means fanatical, farbicina, less than farbicina

[00:13:54.200 --> 00:14:00.080]
goyam like fundamentalist and sick of Alabama. Oh, a two of a reason Alabama. Well, no

[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:05.280]
nobody does know as Yiddish. And sick of that. Well, he's sick of that. He's not sponed

[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:09.860]
it right. Sick of that means they suck up, you know, and ask his here. Oh, I can say

[00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:19.960]
that. Kiss her. Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry. It's okay. It says, could you enlighten me and

[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:24.240]
call your other dumbass? I mean, you're dumb listeners. So there you go. Thanks a lot

[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:28.980]
for my buddy in Alabama, Michigan stater. Well, I'm going out to the ball game today. Good.

[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.640]
You'll have a good time there. Love spring training games. Excellent. Yeah, there's no pressure.

[00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:36.520]
It's like an ice-relike atmosphere. Yep. And maybe they even have good food there at

[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:40.900]
that quarter-loaded L.C. him. Stop there. Is it really? Yeah. I bet it's better than

[00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.900]
the, oh, I shouldn't start talking about the food at the Macarena. I'll get suspended

[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:49.420]
for that. Although I would like to remind, I don't do suspensions. Yeah. No, no, that's

[00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:53.420]
your last. I've made that very clear to these people. I don't do suspensions. It's just

[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:58.380]
that's baby crap. You know, I don't do that. They want to play hardball with me than

[00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:06.140]
fine. I'll see them with Ellis Rubin. He sure did hold a job for like a Lionel Tate, didn't

[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:13.080]
he? Yeah. If you thought Ronnie Zamora was in good shape, went to the L.A. Well, Ellis

[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:18.360]
is under a lot of pressure, you know? Well, apparently he's going to get 10 to 30 years,

[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:23.000]
right? Yeah. Well, his attorney was Ellis Rubin. Better than the alternatives. Ronnie Zamora

[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:29.560]
got 26. When I first came to town, that was the big case for Ronnie Zamora first. Yeah,

[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:33.760]
I remember. Ellis defended him with a television intoxication case, got a nationwide publicity

[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:39.020]
and got Ronnie 26 years in a slammer, which he just got out. Did they give him a television?

[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:44.040]
I think that fellow would be a little too intoxicating, just every now and then a bottle

[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:48.040]
of cheap wine, bottle of grandma boon. Meanwhile, he was in a slammer. Did he get to watch

[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:51.180]
that's what I'm talking about? Yeah. They don't want to be overly intoxicated. A little

[00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:56.120]
bit was okay, but TV was just too intoxicating. Well, listen, have a great day. I'm going

[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:59.980]
out to with my impungeant mind guts out. I'm going to just play $5 today and say that

[00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:03.620]
Lossy Dollars stuff. I'm just go crazy. I'm going to go watch a few winnings. So you have

[00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:08.460]
good luck. Yeah. There you go. And you too. Okay. Have a good day. You're not betting

[00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:12.580]
on his game now, are you? No, I don't bet. You know who used to bet exhibition base?

[00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:15.300]
You already told me this. Yeah. Okay. Never mind. See you. Bye.

[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:14.740]

[00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:12.300]

[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:12.540]

[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:12.540]

[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:12.540]

[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:12.540]

[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:12.540]

[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:12.540]

[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:12.580]
Bye.

[00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:13.820]
Bye.

[00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:14.300]
Bye.

[00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:15.380]
Bye.

[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:15.700]
Bye.

[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:15.700]

[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:15.700]

[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:15.700]

[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:15.700]

[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:15.700]

[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.560]
Bye.

[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.400]
Bye.

[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.000]
Bye.

[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:31.980]
Bye.

[00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:43.360]
Bye.

[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:43.780]
Bye.

[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:43.780]

[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:43.780]

[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:43.780]

[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:43.780]

[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:44.420]
Bye.

[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:44.820]
Bye.

[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:44.820]

[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:45.000]
Bye.

[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:45.680]
Bye.

[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.340]
Bye.

[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:53.880]
Bye.

[00:19:53.880 --> 00:20:22.680]
This is new Roger Busy Shameless. This is by 16Q.

[00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:53.860]
I'm going to have to go.

[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:53.860]

[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:53.860]

[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:53.860]

[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:53.860]

[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:53.860]

[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:53.860]

[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:53.860]

[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:53.860]

[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:53.860]

[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:53.860]

[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:53.860]

[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:53.860]

[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:53.860]

[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:53.860]

[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:06.880]
I'm going to have to go.

[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.660]
I'm going to have to go.

[00:21:53.860 --> 00:22:23.840]
I'm going to have to go.

[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:34.280]
I'm going to have to go.

[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:15.120]
I'm going to have to go.

[00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:16.760]
I'm going to have to go.

[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:16.760]

[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:16.800]
I'm going to have to go.

[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:16.800]

[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:16.880]
I'm going to have to go.

[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:16.900]
I'm going to have to go.

[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:16.920]
I'm going to have to go.

[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:16.920]

[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:17.380]
I'm going to have to go.

[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:17.400]
I'm going to have to go.

[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.540]
I'm going to have to go.

[00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.480]
I'm going to have to go.

[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.840]
I'm going to have to go.

[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:53.820]
Again, more and more and more including police, other espons, other paw elephants, hero elephants, other

[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:53.820]

[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:53.820]

[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:57.540]
First we show yesterday what best describes the deals 30 years on the year in Miami.

[00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:58.600]
3rd man.

[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.240]
2003 votes.

[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:02.120]
Unbelievable.

[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:03.280]
Un-

[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:03.640]
Unbelievable.

[00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:07.680]
That's quite a feather in that guy's cat that called it in a couple days ago, remember

[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:07.860]
that?

[00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:09.120]
Where we held it all of.

[00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.000]
He called and he said, how about un-

[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:12.400]
Unbelievable.

[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:14.000]
Un-

[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:23.640]
Intertaining 605, a real mitzvah 121, the Palsus F4 to 112, fun 112, informative 86, a miracle

[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:24.180]
77.

[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:28.660]
You know, I think even Tim Williams over at the old Zeta days, you know, the sunny boy whose

[00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:33.960]
mother-in-law owned the radio station, even he wasn't as repressive and restrictive as

[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:34.560]
the current regime.

[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.960]
Even he wasn't that paranoid and terrified of his own shadow.

[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.460]
We're going to have a big billboard campaign.

[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:41.480]
Q-A-M.

[00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:42.220]
We're scared.

[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.720]
We are, man.

[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:45.520]
We are.

[00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:45.740]

[00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:46.240]
We are petrified.

[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:47.560]
We are terrified.

[00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:49.220]
We're shaken and quickened in our boots.

[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.360]
A miracle 77.

[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.560]
He said, oh, you can say that again.

[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.140]
It's a miracle.

[00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:55.180]
Provocative 73.

[00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:57.120]
Ponderous enough already 71.

[00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.320]
I think they may have a point.

[00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:01.160]
In lightning 43, stale 34.

[00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:04.220]
So we just went over it between those two that's 5.1%.

[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:04.780]
That's bad.

[00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:09.180]
Scythylating 23, lucky 11 and aggravating only 5.

[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:10.380]
Well, it's aggravating on this end.

[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:10.860]
I'll take it that.

[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.600]
Not necessarily because of the show, but sure as hell is aggravating.

[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:14.940]
Especially these days.

[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:15.420]
Good.

[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:15.980]
Golly.

[00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:17.600]
See, you know something?

[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:21.240]
There's nothing- there is nothing in the world I despise worse than a phony, you know?

[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.680]
Somebody comes up to you.

[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.320]
In fact, Greg used to do this with you all the time and you knew he hated you like poison

[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.800]
the feeling he can use you obviously.

[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:29.480]
And used to pull that all the time.

[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:30.160]
It came in you guys.

[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:35.160]
It'd been the drug brothers grip and the fisting and the shaking and this, you know, the

[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.440]
Mason secret handshake.

[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.060]
Exactly.

[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.720]
A little little finger there on your palm and a hand.

[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:40.400]
Jump it up in the air.

[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:41.000]
Right.

[00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:41.380]
Right.

[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:41.920]
That's it.

[00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:43.460]
Do it a high five, jump in a high five.

[00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:46.020]
And you know the hated you said, they're like poison.

[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.120]
I can't stand by fake airsats, you know?

[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.700]
Don't glad hand me in color with a big smile.

[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:52.700]
Hey, you're great.

[00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:53.360]
You're fantastic.

[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:54.500]
Whatever you guys are.

[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.620]
And then just keep stabbing me and stabbing me and going back.

[00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:59.000]
You know, I just can't deal with that.

[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:01.920]
So just to stay away, that's my best suggestion for these people.

[00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:03.060]
They want to show to continue.

[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.400]
Stay the hell away.

[00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:08.580]
I'll show up every day and do the best I can under your very limited circumstances.

[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.120]
That's all I can do because you people are depressing.

[00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:13.940]
I'm going to play you depress me in honor of the new management.

[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:16.580]
Who should be the Democratic Party's president?

[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.620]
So by the way, this isn't just stick today, okay?

[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:19.580]
Joe, this is not stick.

[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:20.920]
This is a from the heart.

[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:25.080]
Who should be the Democratic Party's presidential candidate in 2008?

[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:26.980]
746 votes.

[00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:29.080]
How are Dean 146?

[00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:30.940]
How do you like that?

[00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:33.460]
I'm going to make you feel a little bit better.

[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:33.900]
It does.

[00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:35.580]
It makes no difference.

[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:36.300]
139.

[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.620]
I'm not sure those might be Republicans as I say in that or people who think they ain't got

[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.400]
no chance or they're all is lost.

[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.960]
It's kind of like the QM mentality, you know, all is lost.

[00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:45.920]
Hillary Clinton 133.

[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.020]
Al Gore 70.

[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:48.520]
Barack Obama 59.

[00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:50.000]
Wesley Clark 45.

[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:52.240]
He can start exploring all the delis and South Florida again.

[00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:54.020]
Joe Biden 38.

[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.300]
John Edwards 37.

[00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:56.660]
Wait till we get near the bottom.

[00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:57.460]
It's really revealing.

[00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:58.740]
I don't care 31.

[00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.020]
I hate this poll 24.

[00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:04.300]
John Kerry only 14 and the outgoing governor of Virginia, Mark Warner 10.

[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.140]
John Kerry is like right near the bottom.

[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:08.860]
How do you like that?

[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.860]
I mean, Al Gore is, you know, he's got a respectable 71 votes.

[00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:14.560]
But John Kerry is way down near the bottom.

[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:16.740]
Isn't that very revealing?

[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:17.620]
Even though we all know that.

[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:20.260]
It's not a damn light and probably did win the last election, but nevertheless they

[00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:21.480]
still don't want to lock him up.

[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:22.660]
A lockler in there.

[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.360]
They want somebody who was against the war from the beginning who tells it like it is,

[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.740]
told it like it was right from the beginning.

[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.220]
Doesn't like all over the place.

[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:32.080]
It does make up apologies in the audio and really kicks ass and that's how we're deemed.

[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:33.280]
That's who got my vote.

[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.540]
How are deemed demand, baby?

[00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:40.360]
I realize it's only like early 2006, but it's never too early to be, you know, starting

[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:41.520]
to plan against fascism.

[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:45.840]
Just like here at QA, we've been to start having some secret meetings pretty soon.

[00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:48.220]
This is Neil Roger.

[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:52.680]
This is 5.16 QAX.

[00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:59.360]
Here to tell it to rocket rollers past their prime.

[00:27:59.540 --> 00:27:59.920]
What's happened?

[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.100]
Straight out of Detroit, Roxley is this kid right?

[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:02.680]
What's up?

[00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:03.980]
I'm Scott Stab.

[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.060]
And the secret, no one knew.

[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:07.540]
I don't spend a lot of money on videos.

[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.060]
I don't think a lot of people realize that.

[00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:11.980]
Is it true love or something more?

[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:12.480]
Higher.

[00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:13.660]
Right here.

[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.500]
I think it turned the cameras on.

[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.120]
You put the thought into the video and not the money.

[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.200]
They call each other pet names.

[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:21.320]
Lon, mama.

[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:23.400]
See what you did it.

[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:26.140]
And no one understands what these two share.

[00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.360]
That's when the stage sets are and that's when the videos are.

[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:31.800]
Sometimes, the simplest things matter most.

[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.420]
Play one of my songs.

[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:35.640]
I just don't think that's necessary.

[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:38.820]
Grammy winning singers, Kid Rock and Scott Stab.

[00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:40.980]
Starry Broke Back, Roxley.

[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:42.680]
It's good to meet you.

[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:45.520]
1031.

[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.740]
Well, I can see there's a couple others that are in there.

[00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:49.580]
I'm not going to be playing either of it nowadays.

[00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:53.120]
If you thought we were censored and muzzleed before, you

[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.020]
won't see nothing yet.

[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.560]
Just trust me when I tell you.

[00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:57.980]
They haven't got a clue.

[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.900]
More bad news from over there in that part of the world.

[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:04.740]
Why don't you ever read any of the good news?

[00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:05.840]
There isn't any.

[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:09.560]
A suicide attack arammed a car packed with explosives

[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:12.020]
into a vehicle carrying an American diplomat in Pakistan's

[00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:14.200]
largest city, Karachi, killing four people,

[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.460]
including the diplomat.

[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.400]
A head of president Bush's visit to Pakistan.

[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:18.300]
How do you like that?

[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.400]
Oh my God.

[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.480]
Bush condemned the attack near the US consulate

[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.620]
and the luxury hotel in Karachi and said the terrorists

[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:25.560]
and killers would not prevent him from going to Pakistan

[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.940]
on the final leg of his tour of South Asia.

[00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:30.180]
He's on his last legs, kind of like us.

[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.820]
We've lost at least one US citizen in the bombing

[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:35.020]
a foreign service officer and I said our country's deepest

[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:36.920]
condolences to that person's loved ones

[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.240]
and family your president said at a news conference

[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.060]
in neighboring India.

[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.420]
I wonder if they were feeding him Korean India.

[00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:43.320]
Oh boy.

[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.140]
That's what it is.

[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.800]
You thought this president stumped before?

[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:47.500]
Unbelievable.

[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:53.360]
Oh, and I think about Clinton.

[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.520]
I just flipped on there.

[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:55.920]
Wait till we get to that side about him.

[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.440]
That's not what you thought he was either.

[00:29:59.200 --> 00:29:59.600]
What?

[00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:00.320]
Nothing.

[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:01.220]
It's just all the president.

[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:03.520]
Look, things in life, what about, I've told you this for years.

[00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:06.160]
Things in life are very rarely what they

[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.120]
are pretty beyond the surface.

[00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:08.660]
When you scratch and dig a little bit,

[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:11.080]
not all that deep necessarily, just a little bit

[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:12.100]
like about a tentative an inch.

[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.600]
And you find, oh, look at that.

[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:17.060]
There's a festering rot there and I can smell it.

[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:19.560]
Anyway, we've got some factors left over for me

[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.100]
as to how I'll interspersed those because I don't want

[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:21.900]
to keep dwelling on it.

[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.600]
We've only got to like 1250.

[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:25.980]
And I'm going to race out of here at 1250.

[00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:28.360]
Don't anybody waste your time calling here at 1250

[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.280]
or bothered me because I'll be long gone.

[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:31.840]
Man, I'll be dressed in out the dough.

[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:35.860]
Here's a fact from Dr. Ron Nihalandale,

[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.600]
said yesterday I just wanted to congratulate you

[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.120]
on 30 years of wonderful entertainment.

[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:40.620]
You tell it like it is and that's

[00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:41.780]
been very important for many people.

[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:43.580]
Obviously not for the current management though.

[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:45.160]
They're not interested in telling it like it is.

[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:47.480]
They just want to tell it like the beeslees want us to tell it.

[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.240]
OK, they're going to put the words in our mouth

[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.160]
just like that thing with Howard Biel in that work, you know?

[00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:53.860]
Like Mr. Jensen, he put the words in the mouth

[00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:55.440]
and Howard Biel went on the ear and blah, blah, blah, blah,

[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:55.840]
and did that.

[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:58.360]
I'm a psychologist, says Dr. Ron,

[00:30:58.360 --> 00:30:59.920]
with a practice in the holiday of offering me

[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:01.280]
for my depressed patients to your show,

[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:02.140]
it seems to help them.

[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:05.380]
Oh, yeah, this definitely isn't a show for crazy people.

[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.200]
I'm sorry, Dr. Ron, I want to use that word crazy

[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.420]
for disturbed people.

[00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:10.340]
I've been listening since 88.

[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:12.140]
If that time you were attacking the early birds,

[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:13.760]
you got my attention and then it's still do now.

[00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:14.800]
Best of luck at all that you do.

[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.120]
I hope you decide to stay on the ear

[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:18.180]
after your contract with WQA,

[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.140]
M runs out.

[00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:22.820]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

[00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:23.660]
this guy, you got it.

[00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:25.360]
You don't need my show, Dr. Ron.

[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.180]
You've got the adept of humor, man.

[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:28.360]
You are a real comedian.

[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:29.560]
That's funny.

[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:30.840]
That's pretty funny.

[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.200]
You hope I stay on the ear to the

[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:33.860]
after my contract with this joint runs out.

[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:34.660]
I like it about five minutes.

[00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:40.000]
Let's see, here's Mike in Melbourne for the poll,

[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:41.100]
Sam Nunn.

[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:42.800]
Oh, get out of here, Sam Nunn.

[00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:44.680]
The right-winger and dragger, you kidding me?

[00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:47.800]
Democrat Mayas, he could carry some southern states.

[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:49.120]
He has the foreign policy credentials.

[00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:51.620]
He's a moderate, moderate Mayas, Mike.

[00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:54.060]
And he's been out of the center for almost 10 years.

[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.020]
So the current sense of corporate shouldn't taint him,

[00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:56.840]
but he looks like a goof.

[00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:00.300]
He is a goof, Sam Nunn.

[00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.480]
My God, he wouldn't get none votes from anybody

[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.520]
to let the people of the Hunn Sam Nunn.

[00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:05.440]
Right out of here, Mike.

[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:07.460]
Go pedal his ass someplace else.

[00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:11.060]
Brother, how about Clarence for prison,

[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.460]
at least to get him out of this place anyway?

[00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:15.100]
I think he's just as qualified to be prison.

[00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:16.540]
It is to be PD, wouldn't you say?

[00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:18.880]
I would say one, I don't want to pretend it was whatever.

[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:21.040]
So who made up that story about how he got there

[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:22.620]
in the middle of the game or an hour late in the game?

[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:24.140]
You're the one that made up in the middle of the game.

[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:25.020]
We told you late.

[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.220]
Late was totally shut.

[00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:29.260]
The exact words in an hour into the game.

[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:30.640]
No, yes.

[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:32.700]
I was here when you got the story.

[00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:35.460]
That's not what was said.

[00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:36.700]
Okay, what was said?

[00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:37.600]
Half hour.

[00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:39.780]
I think it's so another reason when the game

[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:40.440]
had already started.

[00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:40.960]
Right.

[00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:43.440]
What difference does it make if it's a half hour an hour?

[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:44.540]
You don't know if you're going to broadcast it.

[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:47.840]
That's what you would be there 40 minutes before the game.

[00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:50.120]
Yeah, before the pregame.

[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:53.260]
Yeah, but the whole ticket thing is factual.

[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:56.060]
Also, the rest of it is bogus.

[00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:57.620]
Yes, it is.

[00:32:58.440 --> 00:32:59.520]
Oh my God.

[00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:00.940]
How do I get that check back?

[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:02.940]
Hey, buddy, I didn't.

[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:03.460]
It'll bounce.

[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:03.760]
I didn't.

[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:04.600]
It's already on the story.

[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.660]
It's already on the way between Toronto and Miami.

[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:08.560]
How do I get that thing?

[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:09.500]
How do I pull it back?

[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:10.540]
I just let it go, man.

[00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:14.040]
I don't think so.

[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:15.120]
I better get excuse me.

[00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:16.320]
I got to call my bank now.

[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:16.780]
I got to check.

[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:17.760]
I got to stop payment on.

[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.000]
Now you're all right.

[00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:21.080]
You just send me a lot of pressure like all the rest of us now.

[00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:22.720]
See, I told you, George,

[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.200]
you will never listen to me.

[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:25.680]
You never, ever listen to me.

[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:26.480]
Remember I was telling you,

[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:29.280]
I was sitting in the blood plate in my life is nobody ever listens.

[00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:29.900]
I try.

[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.820]
I try to do my best to help people.

[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:32.520]
I warn you.

[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:34.860]
I told you, oh no, this guy loves me.

[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:36.800]
I never got to be great.

[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.240]
And all this other crap, you know?

[00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:41.920]
If I wanted to take the time, which I don't,

[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:44.560]
because we got a short show today, I could go down point by point.

[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:47.280]
Everything in these last couple of months since the New Regime came in.

[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:49.860]
And every single one of them has turned out to be,

[00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:51.760]
how do I say it delicately?

[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:53.780]
But like not, huh?

[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:54.460]
Bogus?

[00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:56.020]
That's a good word.

[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:56.720]
Bogus.

[00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:58.020]
Bogus.

[00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:00.820]
Like nobody's going to mess with Josh, your George.

[00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:02.860]
And then the next thing I find out, like two minutes later,

[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:04.520]
as Josh is going over to Power 96.

[00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:06.700]
And if he wants to work for free, he can do your show.

[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:10.040]
And the agony of this whole deal continues going on,

[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:12.540]
because this one says this, and corporate says that.

[00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:13.440]
And but it beat that again.

[00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:16.100]
It's like, there's no, there's no, there's no.

[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:16.400]
Yeah.

[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:18.080]
It's a, no.

[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:18.740]
Yeah, like that.

[00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:19.420]
Back and forth.

[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:20.420]
And but it beat but it moved but about.

[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:23.060]
The internal insanity continues.

[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:24.280]
And then of course, this thing with Claire,

[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:27.140]
it's all of a sudden being, he is all the ultimate sense of the world.

[00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:28.800]
Not bad enough, we had Joyce on our ass,

[00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:34.140]
who's evidently unqualified, who's gone way beyond the boundaries of FCC regulation.

[00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:36.180]
But now we also want top of that.

[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:38.580]
Now we have an additional layer of censorship.

[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.520]
Now we got Josh Dero, who wouldn't know.

[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:43.460]
He wouldn't understand radio regulations, FCC rules.

[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:47.040]
If you hit him on a head with a baseball bat, couldn't hurt.

[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:49.380]
But I mean, nevertheless, because where there's no sense, there's no feeling.

[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:54.040]
And in a way, I feel sorry for him because he's had this enormous amount of pressure

[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.420]
and responsibility put on him.

[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:57.440]
Although I don't feel sorry after that call on Monday, you know.

[00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:00.600]
When you were sad this and somebody was in the studio, I, yeah.

[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:02.780]
I'm real good at that scene, long distance.

[00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:05.060]
You know, I can see right from here, right in that studio now.

[00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:06.680]
Laser beams.

[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:10.840]
So like I told you, so far things have not been really hunky to where from where we all

[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:13.060]
sit, so looking pretty, pretty grim.

[00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:15.940]
Although I do like that good decision on that two to four slot.

[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.960]
Video shows Bush heard dire warnings ahead of Katrina.

[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:24.860]
And see, and you know, I don't want to, I will because it's anniversary time.

[00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:27.500]
I can, I can, I can, I can milk that through the end of the way through tomorrow.

[00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:28.020]
Sure.

[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:33.180]
But you would think that the very least when all you ask is just pay me on time and leave

[00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:33.580]
me alone.

[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.520]
That said, nothing else.

[00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:37.700]
Don't give me like a bunch, set up a bunch of balloons.

[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:38.740]
You know, it's interesting.

[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:40.540]
They had to Greg Reed go in a way or card.

[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:44.300]
I didn't notice that anybody FedEx, the nice happy 30th anniversary card.

[00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:48.120]
Not that I would have expected it or it was necessary, but that would have been a nice

[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:48.840]
gesture, wouldn't it?

[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:49.340]
Sure.

[00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:52.520]
Have everybody in the building sign, hey, because at least I'm still on the staff.

[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:54.940]
I'm still on the air last time I checked, at least as of this moment.

[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:57.180]
That didn't get done.

[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:00.380]
But it's a very least.

[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:01.540]
Just leave me alone.

[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:02.600]
Don't kiss my ass.

[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:05.060]
Don't tell me how wonderful I am, how great my numbers are.

[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:06.580]
I know I can read the numbers, okay?

[00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:07.880]
I've been doing this a long time.

[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.620]
Just leave me alone and pay me on pay to that's it.

[00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:11.640]
That's it.

[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:16.080]
Do whatever else you want before the show, after the show, after midnight, whatever.

[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:16.960]
I don't care.

[00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:18.040]
Not interested.

[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.920]
And they still can't do that.

[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:25.100]
Because we got a junior program director now who's going, he's going to take control

[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:25.380]
of it.

[00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:28.020]
And just like you were saying before the show, do they everywhere I've ever been?

[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:29.520]
That's their goal.

[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.940]
They get the big ratings, bringing a lot of money.

[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.960]
But oh, we're going to control that, Neil Rogers.

[00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:35.380]
We're going to get control of that show.

[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:36.740]
We're going to control what?

[00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:38.020]
What is there to control?

[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.080]
We're picking ass.

[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:40.780]
You've got some other problems that are under day parts.

[00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:42.260]
Deal with those problems, okay?

[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.300]
We're going to get a hold of him.

[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:45.260]
We're going to control him.

[00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:49.360]
And keep getting these idiotic calls from a junior program director, a little overgrown

[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:50.340]
sports nerd child.

[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:52.880]
And how many times?

[00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:53.800]
See, this is the problem.

[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:57.420]
You've had a general manager who's making decisions based on knowing nothing about the

[00:36:57.860 --> 00:36:59.080]
history of what's going on here.

[00:36:59.420 --> 00:36:59.640]
Nothing.

[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:02.620]
How many times, at least a half a dozen, he's coming.

[00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:03.140]
Oh, what?

[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:04.920]
You shouldn't be playing that and we listened to it together.

[00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:09.540]
And again, you know, I pointed out to him that he's way out of line, way over line.

[00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:12.560]
Hey, if it's up to Clarence Zero, we won't be playing any bits anymore.

[00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:15.420]
Much less the ones that people really want to hear.

[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:16.380]
We won't be playing nothing.

[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:17.440]
There'll be no more humor.

[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.380]
There'll be no more entertainment because that's the direction we're going in.

[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.080]
I mean, way over the top.

[00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:26.620]
Histeria panic sets in because when you don't know what you're doing, that's when people

[00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:27.420]
get really panicky.

[00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:28.380]
Clarence.

[00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:34.260]
Video shows Bush heard dire warnings ahead of Katrina.

[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:37.200]
Talk about that after the break.

[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.540]
I don't know if I'm going to waste my time taking any calls today because we're going

[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:40.160]
to very short show.

[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.200]
I have a huge pile.

[00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:43.480]
I got a couple more faxes I want to read from yesterday.

[00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:45.760]
And then again, after that, I'm going to like kill myself.

[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:48.280]
This is Neil Roger.

[00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:52.740]
This is 5.62 A.S.

[00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:55.680]
Station stands for nothing.

[00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:56.500]
Absolutely.

[00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:00.920]
This is the CDS.

[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:01.660]
CD news.

[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:02.840]
Good evening.

[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:05.380]
I'm Dan Reather on Special Assignment Force.

[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:06.780]
CDS is being named.

[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:12.940]
Thanks to the Bush administration'suggling of this trumped up war in the Middle East, Muslim

[00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:19.220]
violence exploded again today in protest of the cartoon, directing the prophet Muhammad.

[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:22.340]
Here in the one-strand cool tune town.

[00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:25.840]
Keep your keen fat ass.

[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:28.220]
This is the baby on clean.

[00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:29.120]
The other end.

[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:31.620]
Blame for the violence.

[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:34.880]
Rest squarely on Hamas Barbarra.

[00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:41.780]
And in Pakistan, a forties report three protesters were injured today and individuals fell on their

[00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:42.140]
heads.

[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:48.920]
The situation was converted by the news from Tehran that Iran was producing its own

[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:49.400]
cannon.

[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.640]
And reporting live from tune down.

[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:54.500]
And then rather, she be a student.

[00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:56.280]
Now I feel.

[00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.080]
That's all I folks.

[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:00.180]
That's all I folks.

[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:04.060]
1044, a QA in the van is at the circle K on Oriole Boulevard and commercial.

[00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:05.960]
I never heard of Oriole Boulevard in my life.

[00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:07.060]
I'll be there, but it's there.

[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:08.600]
West of Powerline road.

[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.260]
And we'll be there till 1250.

[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.320]
It's at the circle K.

[00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:15.060]
So just kind of circle the block and stop on and get your up about 30.

[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:18.940]
And T-shirt 20 bucks to proceed to a van at the rescue.

[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:23.440]
And Oriole Boulevard and commercial.

[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:24.680]
I just know I did.

[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:28.920]
No idea, but there's lots of good stuff on that CD that they'll never hear in the air.

[00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:31.260]
I got news for it.

[00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:35.900]
If we know yesterday what we know today or whenever we picked whoever picked out these

[00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:41.260]
vids on the CD, we could add like a quadruple disc set because you ain't going to hear

[00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:43.140]
much of anything anymore the way this place is going.

[00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:46.060]
Anyway, I'm just going to keep plotting along.

[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:48.880]
We only got a couple hours and then the thank God I'll just run out the door and pretend

[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:49.860]
I never wreck him in today.

[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:52.820]
You talk about getting off under wrong foot with people.

[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:55.860]
This is getting off under wrong with a club foot, you know?

[00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:59.920]
Oh my God, you guys are just great.

[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:00.680]
They're awesome.

[00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:02.020]
Anything I can do.

[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:02.240]
Yeah.

[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:02.860]
Uh huh.

[00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:08.460]
And then again, like you're broadcasting with Dick Cheney, man.

[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:11.060]
Every time they look around, they're shot in the face again.

[00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:15.020]
By the way, Oriol is the road that takes you to Lockhart Stadium.

[00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:15.840]
Oh, I see.

[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:17.120]
So that's kind of like an anticipation.

[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:18.700]
It is exhibition space ball game.

[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:19.300]
Excellent.

[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:19.740]
Good idea.

[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:23.320]
Like I said, all the people go to the ball game, stop buying, pick up your merchandise.

[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:23.840]
Please.

[00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:26.780]
Help out all those abandoned puppies and the cats.

[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:31.160]
In dramatic and sometimes agonizing terms, federal disaster officials warned President

[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:34.480]
Bush and his homeland security chief before Hurricane Katrina struck that the storm could

[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:38.260]
reach levies, risk lives in New Orleans, superdome and over bomb rescuers, according to

[00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:39.880]
confidential video footage of the briefings.

[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:43.940]
This is just another gigantic black mark on his idiot resume.

[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:49.360]
Bush didn't ask a single question during the final government wide briefing the 84 Katrina

[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:54.080]
struck on August 29th, but assured soon to be battered state officials, we are fully prepared.

[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:55.300]
Ha, ha, ha.

[00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:59.820]
Six days of footage and transcripts obtained by the Associated Press Show and excruciating

[00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:03.640]
detail, they were while federal officials anticipated the tragedy that unfolded in New

[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.040]
Orleans and elsewhere along the Gulf Coast.

[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:09.220]
They were faithfully slow to realize they hadn't mustered enough resources to deal with

[00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:12.280]
the unprecedented disaster, more blood on your president's hands.

[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:16.280]
Even Rucker Howard in the hit you never had this much blood on his hands.

[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:21.420]
Link by secure video Bush's bravado in August 29th, starkly contrasts with the dire warnings

[00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:25.640]
as disaster chief and he cut capiny a federal state local officials provided during the four

[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:26.500]
days before the storm.

[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:29.300]
I love that word, a capiny of officials.

[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:30.800]
A whole bunch of folks.

[00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:36.780]
A top hurricane expert voiced grave concerns about the levies and then FEMA agency chief

[00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:40.580]
Michael Brown, heck of a job, Brownie told the president and Homeland Security chief Mickey

[00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:44.700]
Churdov that he feared they were to end up disaster teams to help evacue out evacuees at

[00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:45.340]
the super dome.

[00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:50.520]
I'm concerned about their ability to respond to a catastrophe within a catastrophe Brown

[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:53.080]
told his bosses they had to know before Katrina made landfall.

[00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:57.100]
Some of the footage conflicts with the defenses that federal state and local officials have

[00:41:57.100 --> 00:42:01.100]
made and tried to deflect blame and minimize the political fallout from the failed Katrina

[00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:01.520]
response.

[00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:06.520]
Homeland Security officials for example have said the fog of war blinded them early on to

[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:10.200]
the magnitude of the disaster that the video and transcripts show federal and local officials

[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:14.040]
discussed threats clearly reviewed long made plans and understood that Katrina would

[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:15.780]
redevestation of historic proportions.

[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:18.900]
I'm sure it'll be in the top 10 or 15 when all is said and done.

[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.140]
National Hurricane Center's Max Mayfield warned that they could treat the last of Gulf

[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:23.400]
coast that old Max.

[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:28.280]
I don't buy the fog award defense Brown told the AP in the interview today it was a fog

[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:34.820]
of bureaucracy even old incompetent Brownie Brown even he is shocked by their ineptitude.

[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:39.480]
Bush declared four days after the storm I don't think anybody anticipated the breach

[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:43.120]
of levies that gushed deadly waters and flood waters in New Orleans but the transcripts

[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:47.200]
and video show there was plenty of talk about that possibility and that Bush was mighty

[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:47.680]
worried too.

[00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:51.320]
Another liar liar your pants around fire Georgie how do you like that?

[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.200]
How this man cannot be impeached it's just what I got that story by Doug Thomson.

[00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:59.600]
He has Republicans here Democratic games and November could increase cost when peach

[00:42:59.600 --> 00:42:59.960]
Bush.

[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:01.560]
Please please.

[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:06.520]
Well there's any semblance of a country left and then after that when then we'll impeach

[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:07.780]
the beesleys how's that?

[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:10.580]
Don't tease.

[00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:16.000]
No no seriously I mean these people either they they want us to make chicken salad with chicken

[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.120]
droppings and I you know there's that old thing you just can't do that I don't know how

[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:23.540]
they where's that magic wand you've got there on that 360 you work along there I guess

[00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:27.180]
that's the only way we're going to do it because every day that goes by you can't say

[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:31.040]
this you can't play that and Josh there was going to he's going to decide what it

[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:37.920]
all you know it's madness madness and it's all based on cowardice and fear oh what are

[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:42.240]
we going to do oh I got news for I'm not the one that made those mistakes I warned them

[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:46.320]
loudly and vociferously against those mistakes and he still like I said nobody listens

[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:50.860]
to old Neil what I know nothing about this business so you know yesterday that 30th anniversary

[00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:55.240]
I guess it was just a dog and pony show you know just oh you know just like having a party

[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:59.440]
you know get the blues out in the party makers make a lot of noise and get drunk and that's

[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:05.880]
it as opposed to having like a just the tiniest bit of respect I don't want anybody kissing

[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:13.000]
my ass but just a tiny bit of respect I understand that I know where the line is okay but what

[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.520]
the hell could I possibly know you know we're dealing with real professionals Bill Clinton

[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:22.220]
helped do buy on port steel this is very depressing it's a depressing Thursday I'm sorry but

[00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:25.360]
I've always told you you're never going to have two like you four days in a row yesterday was

[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:29.940]
a real upper and today is a real downer so maybe I shouldn't go to wood by maybe I should just

[00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:35.640]
jump out the window Bill Clinton formed a US president advised top officials from Dubai two weeks ago

[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:40.700]
on how to address growing US concerns over the acquisition of five US container terminals by DP

[00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:46.380]
world it came even as his wife senator Hillary Clinton was leading efforts to derail the deal you

[00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:50.460]
know pushing with one hand pulling back with the other kind of like Wally Hennessy at the track

[00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:55.220]
mr. Clinton who this week called the United Arab Emirates a good ally to America advised

[00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:59.760]
Dubai's leaders to propose a 45 day delay to allow for intensive investigation of the acquisition

[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:08.140]
according to a spokesman but you like that okay however Mrs. Clinton remains a leading voice

[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:11.880]
against the deal and this week proposed legislation to block it arguing that the US could not afford

[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:16.580]
to surrender our port operations to foreign governments mr. Clinton spokesman said president

[00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:19.840]
Clinton is the former president of the west and the secretary seems many calls for more leaders

[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:23.620]
and leading figures every week about two weeks ago they do by leaders called him and he suggested

[00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:27.640]
they submit to the full and regular scrutiny process and they should put maximum safeguards

[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:32.040]
and security into any port proposal he added that mr. Clinton supported his wife's position on

[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:36.440]
the deal and that ideally state owned companies without no new us port operations so this is one

[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:39.800]
of those stories this is from the financial times where the headline doesn't necessarily fit the

[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:44.380]
rest of it you know I'm saying we said like I said pushing with one hand pulling back with the other

[00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:48.620]
mr. Clinton's contract their contact excuse me contact with Dubai and they should want to

[00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:52.840]
score his relationship he's developed with the United Arab Emirates and leaving Orifice in 2002

[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:58.060]
he was paid $300,000 to address a summit in Dubai I'm sure that had nothing to do with his involvement

[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:05.580]
the whole world is a bunch of horrors folks all your kids they don't forget the I mean the whole world

[00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:09.980]
is a bunch of excuse me who were they careful the backlash against Dubai's take over

[00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:14.160]
seeing some lawmakers in Washington highlights you know seriously I'm gonna I'm gonna just put this

[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:18.780]
on the floor right now I'm gonna tell you something seriously we have reached a point in this

[00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:25.680]
country now in your country a turning point at which there is no such thing as free speech and

[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:31.080]
the way this company is respiring and reacting to it is terrifying not just frightening not just

[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:37.640]
a little bit unruving it is terrifying to me how cowardly can you become how where do we draw the

[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:41.360]
line then when's the next person go to come in I mean the thing from Hank about what we can't

[00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:47.770]
to knock the hero since when since when they're a competitor for crying out loud exactly they hit us

[00:46:47.770 --> 00:46:54.590]
like poison with or without their stupid spots and it's just reaching the point when we're going

[00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:57.930]
to have somebody come and say well you can't knock out the president because the Republicans are

[00:46:57.930 --> 00:47:02.270]
going to buy a bunch of spots for the elections this fall where do we draw the freaking line of

[00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:06.790]
having any kind of freedom of speech I mean just a semblance of it and I remember when that

[00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:11.250]
whole Janet Jackson craft started and then I you know and then very rapidly that evolved into what

[00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:15.770]
we got now and I've got people like supposedly liberal or progressive Jay Rockerfucker from

[00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:20.670]
West Virginia proposing a decency regulation to be extended the satellite and cable for crying out loud

[00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:26.830]
where the hell does it end and that's and that's why the Democratic Party thinks they're

[00:47:26.830 --> 00:47:30.030]
joined out because instead of being the buffer there to stand in the way and holding up the hand

[00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:33.450]
and say wait a minute hold it you can't go any further than this they're like encouraging it

[00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:37.210]
because they want to they want to be the good they don't want to be out goody too shoes you

[00:47:37.210 --> 00:47:42.090]
understand what I'm saying I don't I mean nobody wants to support smut you know that'd be like

[00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:47.890]
uh... and rising out gold steam and screw magazine you can't do that I'm for smut not

[00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:51.490]
I'm all for smut I'm a pervert baby and I'm proud of it and so are most people that I know I don't

[00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:56.070]
know almost anybody's not a pervert they just lie alive just I'm happy to agree that's right

[00:47:56.730 --> 00:48:00.910]
you know that everybody got the one who's screamed the loudest of anybody else being a pervert

[00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:05.730]
that's what the biggest pervert and we've always known that bill of riley and others

[00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:11.470]
always the same story well this one says this and that one says that and therefore we can't do

[00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:15.990]
this you know make up your mind okay I'll tell you right now I'm going to put the Neil Rogers

[00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:20.710]
challenge on the table right now I got almost three years left on the deal if this company

[00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:25.210]
doesn't want the Neil Rogers show on the stage and there's a very simple way to deal with it okay

[00:48:25.210 --> 00:48:30.750]
after that big 30th take anniversary yesterday write a check you know write out a check

[00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:35.030]
not a penny more or penny less than is due you know do the math I can get out my calculator

[00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:38.550]
and figure out it's a lot of money write a check I'll go away you'll never hear from me again

[00:48:39.090 --> 00:48:45.990]
I'll walk away just look away exactly but if you want me to do a show if you want me to do the

[00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:50.610]
Neil Rogers show don't every day keep coming up with some cocka-mamae logic about oh gee well that's

[00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:57.030]
over the line and this and that's below me okay I've been doing this a very very long time

[00:48:58.910 --> 00:49:03.750]
and I think that the the changing of regime as opposed to what some of you thought including you

[00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:08.710]
as opposed to being a good thing the again it's learning on a job kind of video well I got

[00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:12.230]
news for it so I like being a president there's some things you're going to learn on the job nobody

[00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:18.950]
ever has enough training in life to be the president but you can't learn it all but then again

[00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:22.130]
why would they ever want to listen to me and I'm saying who would want to listen to me I don't

[00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:26.170]
know nothing what all the success I've had just like that one choice and I pulled yesterday lucky if

[00:49:26.170 --> 00:49:30.110]
it's just been lucky for 30 years that's all because I know anything about this business or because

[00:49:30.110 --> 00:49:33.810]
the show is any good or because people listen to oily and listen online all over the country and

[00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:40.210]
all over the world no it's just because of luck I know nothing it's a coincidence yeah as

[00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:44.810]
opposed to little sports nerds they're the experts on broadcasting and about to I got news for

[00:49:44.810 --> 00:49:49.210]
it I'm not even gonna say it it's not even what we're talking about here's a fact for me yesterday

The first exhibition is game of the season.

[00:54:11.410 --> 00:54:12.370]
Actually said about that.

[00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:13.510]

[00:54:13.570 --> 00:54:13.970]

That's right.

[00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:26.430]
And then again, Foxy Roxy.

[00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:27.510]

[00:54:27.710 --> 00:54:28.090]
They're good buddies.

[00:54:28.570 --> 00:54:30.470]
Now what about that TV guy, Rich Waltz guy?

[00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:31.370]
Is he back this year too?

[00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:32.430]
He is awful, man.

[00:54:32.610 --> 00:54:33.090]
He's brutal.

[00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:35.530]
I would imagine he's back, yeah?

[00:54:35.690 --> 00:54:36.470]
Oh my god.

[00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:37.310]
You got to be kidding me.

[00:54:37.410 --> 00:54:37.950]
Rich Waltz?

[00:54:38.810 --> 00:54:40.710]
I think somebody got to put a horse's head in his bed.

[00:54:41.590 --> 00:54:45.530]
Mad Dog after the ball game, then Pantin preview at 6.30 and the Pantas in the Canadian at

[00:54:45.530 --> 00:54:46.970]
the 7 o'clock from the Macarena.

[00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.970]
And he cares for the game.

[00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:49.450]
It isn't the Macarena, isn't it?

[00:54:49.450 --> 00:54:49.970]
It's a home game.

[00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:52.010]
Yes.

[00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:53.030]
Come on, Josh.

[00:54:53.310 --> 00:54:53.850]
Get with it.

[00:54:55.330 --> 00:54:55.670]
What?

[00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:59.850]
You know, when you're not getting paid to show up there for a few minutes and pretend you

[00:54:59.850 --> 00:55:01.210]
belong there, that was okay.

[00:55:01.310 --> 00:55:02.210]
They didn't have tremendous interest.

[00:55:02.410 --> 00:55:05.310]
Now that you're not on the payroll over there anymore, oh, I don't know.

[00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:06.430]
Who cares about that crap?

[00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.970]
That's right.

[00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:07.110]

[00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:07.890]
That's hockey.

[00:55:08.490 --> 00:55:09.650]
Yeah, that's hockey crap.

[00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:10.850]
Exactly.

[00:55:12.070 --> 00:55:16.470]
A review of the United Arab Emirates own company's plan to take over a portion of operations

[00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:21.030]
of Key US ports never looked into whether the company had ties to Al-Qaeda or other

[00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:21.390]
terrorists.

[00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:23.930]
They key Republican lawmakers told CNN yesterday.

[00:55:23.930 --> 00:55:25.730]
Never bothered looking into that.

[00:55:27.050 --> 00:55:30.230]
Representative Peter King of the York chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee

[00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:33.610]
said officials from the Homeland Security and Treasury departments told him weeks ago

[00:55:33.610 --> 00:55:38.490]
that their 30-day review of the deal did not look into the question of links between

[00:55:38.490 --> 00:55:38.850]
D.P.

[00:55:38.850 --> 00:55:39.730]
World and Al-Qaeda.

[00:55:39.970 --> 00:55:42.190]
Why would anybody be bothering with minor details like that?

[00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:43.070]
Yeah, you're nitpicking.

[00:55:43.790 --> 00:55:43.930]
Huh?

[00:55:44.970 --> 00:55:45.350]
Nitpicker.

[00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:49.010]
King said the officials told him after he asked about investigation into possible terrorist

[00:55:49.010 --> 00:55:50.970]
ties, con-Risman, you don't understand.

[00:55:50.970 --> 00:55:52.450]
We don't conduct a thorough investigation.

[00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:55.930]
We just asked the intel director if there's anything on file and he said no.

[00:55:56.930 --> 00:55:59.970]
There was no real investigation conducted during the 30-day period.

[00:55:59.970 --> 00:56:00.830]
But third, man!

[00:56:00.910 --> 00:56:04.250]
King who has been a vocal critic of the deal told CNN, I can't emphasize this enough.

[00:56:05.110 --> 00:56:06.410]
There was no real investigation.

[00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:11.290]
King's comments have peer-to-concredited testimony by administration officials before Congress

[00:56:11.290 --> 00:56:15.370]
this week that a thorough review of any terrorist ties had occurred during the initial review

[00:56:15.370 --> 00:56:15.790]
of the deal.

[00:56:16.990 --> 00:56:20.770]
After King and other lawmakers raised concerns about the deal, the company agreed to a 45-day

[00:56:20.770 --> 00:56:21.810]
review by the investigation.

[00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:25.030]
King said the administration should use the time to investigate the firm rather than

[00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:27.290]
try to convince lawmakers that the deal should be approved.

[00:56:27.970 --> 00:56:31.430]
When I hear the administration saying they want to educate the Congress and the American

[00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:34.010]
public, they should be educating themselves, King said.

[00:56:34.330 --> 00:56:35.330]
They should do the investigation.

[00:56:35.330 --> 00:56:36.970]
They should have done after the 30 days.

[00:56:38.050 --> 00:56:39.270]
About 30, man!

[00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:43.430]
A wave of concern is swept Capitol Hill over the news to allow a big bit of poop to poop.

[00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:48.170]
Critics note that two of the suicide hijackers involved in the attacks of 9-11 came from

[00:56:48.170 --> 00:56:52.230]
the United Arab Emirates and that money for the plot was funneled through banks in Dubai,

[00:56:52.550 --> 00:56:54.730]
the banking hub of the Persian Gulf.

[00:56:56.690 --> 00:56:58.610]
We just mentioned a couple of those things.

[00:56:59.490 --> 00:56:59.930]
Passing.

[00:57:01.770 --> 00:57:05.810]
By the way, when it came to the business of tracing where the money went after 9-11, remember

[00:57:05.810 --> 00:57:05.990]
that?

[00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:09.250]
They were as uncooperative as anyone, just like the Saudi people.

[00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:09.690]
So do I.

[00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.910]
Yeah, so-and-was.

[00:57:11.070 --> 00:57:11.870]
That's exactly it.

[00:57:12.190 --> 00:57:13.070]
And even it wasn't gay.

[00:57:13.290 --> 00:57:14.250]
The gay-stone wall.

[00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:16.030]
It was the straight-stone wall.

[00:57:17.210 --> 00:57:19.150]
Dog tops in your buddy at Moabee got a hurry.

[00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:20.310]
We only got till 1250.

[00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:20.930]
Thank God.

[00:57:21.090 --> 00:57:21.590]
Oh, brother.

[00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:24.030]
Mark it down in the calendar.

[00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:24.570]
Mark, second.

[00:57:24.770 --> 00:57:26.110]
This must be the eyes of March.

[00:57:28.790 --> 00:57:30.750]
If I survive till 1250 today.

[00:57:32.070 --> 00:57:36.110]
I'm just literally-I think on the quarters, maybe I just didn't wipe when I shaved.

[00:57:36.250 --> 00:57:37.390]
I wiped the shaving cream off.

[00:57:37.570 --> 00:57:38.290]
Oh, okay, when you shaved.

[00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:39.710]
I was foaming it to my mouth.

[00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:42.730]
Just apple-plectic.

[00:57:43.690 --> 00:57:46.930]
You know, it's almost like working in the Persian carpet factory here at QA.

[00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:49.110]
Now, they keep pulling the carpet out from under your over and over again.

[00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:53.790]
In fact, that's the good thing you got me those-those-those right-the snow cleats for my shoes.

[00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:57.710]
GOP-this is Doug Thompson.

[00:57:58.370 --> 00:58:01.930]
GOP political strategist, spirit shift in congressional seats from Republican Democratic

[00:58:01.930 --> 00:58:06.130]
hands in the midterm election of November, could spray renewed movement to impeach President

[00:58:06.130 --> 00:58:06.470]
Bush.

[00:58:09.770 --> 00:58:13.890]
A possibility admits political scientists George Harley, who served in the Nixon-Euregen

[00:58:13.890 --> 00:58:17.530]
administrations, the margin of the GOP majority in both the House and Senate protects the

[00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:20.390]
President right now, but a shift could build momentum to impeach.

[00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:22.310]
Other strategists agree.

[00:58:23.090 --> 00:58:26.610]
This satisfaction grows almost daily with Bush in both the moderate and conservative Republican

[00:58:26.610 --> 00:58:29.910]
ranks, and some might be willing to go along with Democratic calls for impeachment to

[00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:32.650]
protect their own seats if the GOP majority is reduced by the elections.

[00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:36.390]
Look, this administration has become the gang that can't shoot strates.

[00:58:36.450 --> 00:58:39.510]
His one unhappy strategist that I worked with him during my days in Capitol Hill from

[00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:43.310]
81 to 87 says Doug Thompson, the Democrats don't even have to win back control of him

[00:58:43.310 --> 00:58:44.070]
making up gains.

[00:58:44.410 --> 00:58:48.190]
That'll scare the Republicans enough to think more about their own political hides, arses.

[00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:52.330]
Don't expect any Republican to admit such thought publicly, though they're concerned

[00:58:52.330 --> 00:58:53.150]
not suicidal.

[00:58:53.570 --> 00:58:56.630]
But more and more of them grumble in the cloakroom in the back halls of Congress, saying

[00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:59.190]
Bush is a serious liability to the party and may need to go.

[00:58:59.850 --> 00:59:01.070]
He's got a going problem.

[00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:01.870]
He may need to go.

[00:59:02.650 --> 00:59:06.170]
The private talk intensified this week with published reports that Vice President Dick

[00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:09.970]
Cheney may retire after the midterms, allowing Bush to select a new Vice President who would

[00:59:09.970 --> 00:59:11.210]
need to be confirmed by Congress.

[00:59:11.650 --> 00:59:16.290]
Inside magazine, a publication of the Republican-leaning right-wing Washington Times quotes GOP sources

[00:59:16.290 --> 00:59:20.390]
saying that Cheney is also becoming a liability because of the indictment of his chief of staff

[00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:23.710]
in the ACI-Leaked scandal and the controversy surrounding the delay in reporting of the

[00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:25.450]
shooting of her friend and lawyer during that hunting.

[00:59:26.070 --> 00:59:30.390]
The sources reported a growing rift between the President and Vice President as well as

[00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:31.250]
their staffs.

[00:59:31.790 --> 00:59:35.030]
The inside article says they said that Mr. Cheney's failure to immediately tell the President

[00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:38.270]
the accidental shooting of the Vice President's hunting colleague earlier this month, that's

[00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:39.270]
no surprise to us.

[00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:42.090]
We reported the growing rift between Bush and Cheney two weeks ago.

[00:59:43.210 --> 00:59:46.970]
At the moment, Cheney's Bush's job security is as Harley, as bad as the Democrats' lowest

[00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:49.510]
Bush, they can't stand the thought of a President Cheney.

[00:59:50.370 --> 00:59:52.270]
New polls show Bush's pro-wab we know about the numbers.

[00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:56.910]
The polls clearly show Americans don't trust the President, even worse they don't like

[00:59:56.910 --> 00:59:57.370]
him, Harley.

[00:59:57.370 --> 01:00:00.270]
He says, if credibility is shot in his legibility isn't far behind.

[01:00:00.730 --> 01:00:04.410]
The polls also show that it is trust-frightened to Republicans who show public support for

[01:00:04.410 --> 01:00:05.210]
Bush and his policies.

[01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:09.710]
The prospects will look very grim for Republicans that said, Ross Baker, a political scientist

[01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:10.430]
and Rutgers.

[01:00:11.090 --> 01:00:14.230]
Larry Sabato, a political analyst at the University of Virginia, analyst.

[01:00:14.830 --> 01:00:15.450]
Don't say, analyst.

[01:00:16.290 --> 01:00:19.910]
Says Bush's problems in the midterms parallel those that face the Republican Party in the

[01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:24.450]
pivotal 72-minute term elections after Richard Nixon resigned in disgrace or the 66-minute

[01:00:24.450 --> 01:00:28.930]
term when widespread voter dissatisfaction with LBJ caused Democrats' seats in both the

[01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:29.470]
House and Senate.

[01:00:30.110 --> 01:00:33.210]
If the election were held next week, Democrats probably would take control of at least one

[01:00:33.210 --> 01:00:34.570]
House of Congress, Sabato, says.

[01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:38.090]
Such a thought means Republicans may have to start eating their own if they want to survive,

[01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:43.370]
and that means even more trouble for the stir across administration of George W. Bush.

[01:00:44.550 --> 01:00:48.190]
And like that, there's a little reason for a hope there.

[01:00:49.090 --> 01:00:52.230]
I'll be talking to a long article about Cindy Sheen and Sam Boastath.

[01:00:53.830 --> 01:00:55.050]
It's just too long.

[01:00:56.610 --> 01:00:59.650]
He's a professor of economics and chairman of the Department of Economics at the University

[01:00:59.650 --> 01:01:00.050]
of Dallas.

[01:01:00.330 --> 01:01:01.410]
We all know who Cindy Sheen is.

[01:01:01.550 --> 01:01:04.710]
If you don't know who Cindy Sheen is, then turn on the survey in the funny pages.

[01:01:05.850 --> 01:01:07.390]
I just don't have time for this today, I think.

[01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:09.590]
But I can stick it in my palm maybe for tomorrow.

[01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:10.010]
Okay.

[01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:10.450]
If I come back.

[01:01:11.070 --> 01:01:11.410]
What do you think?

[01:01:12.310 --> 01:01:12.790]
We'll be going to be there.

[01:01:12.790 --> 01:01:12.850]
We'll be going to be there.

[01:01:12.850 --> 01:01:13.070]
We'll be going to be there.

[01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:16.110]
We'll be going to be there.

[01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:19.950]
Unless I get that checked, I can always FedEx it.

[01:01:21.590 --> 01:01:23.090]
Now these people just don't know what they want.

[01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:26.710]
They want to lay them in your own and they're going to give it like a can of alpo to try

[01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:27.070]
to make it.

[01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:29.690]
It's just amazing to me.

[01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:34.130]
And the very same guy who was lamenting to me in our first conversation, oh, how can

[01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:37.890]
they expect you to do a show with your hands tied behind your back and you can't even

[01:01:37.890 --> 01:01:39.650]
play the farts up and the same guy.

[01:01:39.790 --> 01:01:43.570]
He's like, you know, oh, a bit of a beat, but a hoop bit of up and yeah, we probably are

[01:01:43.570 --> 01:01:44.290]
going over the top.

[01:01:44.410 --> 01:01:45.790]
But why are you going over the top?

[01:01:45.790 --> 01:01:46.950]
That's what I'd like to know, Joe.

[01:01:47.310 --> 01:01:51.850]
Why are you going so above and beyond the colloduty hysterically?

[01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:55.470]
Those were his own words in the email I received this morning response to my own email.

[01:01:55.770 --> 01:01:57.330]
Let me get another thing here.

[01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:01.070]
Direct quote.

[01:02:02.110 --> 01:02:05.670]
I don't think there's any question that we've gone overboard, but it's what we've been

[01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:07.050]
told to do for the time being.

[01:02:11.410 --> 01:02:11.810]
Overboard.

[01:02:12.630 --> 01:02:13.430]
Man overboard.

[01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:18.130]
Robert Sheer writes dubious Dubai deal.

[01:02:18.370 --> 01:02:20.030]
I think I had time for this one before the break.

[01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:21.330]
You think?

[01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:22.790]
OK.

[01:02:23.110 --> 01:02:23.470]
I think you do.

[01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:24.530]
Robert Sheer.

[01:02:24.610 --> 01:02:26.090]
Remember, he was too liberal for the early times.

[01:02:26.090 --> 01:02:26.430]
That's right.

[01:02:26.650 --> 01:02:30.550]
Now he's there for the San Francisco Chronicle and syndicated of course.

[01:02:31.450 --> 01:02:35.190]
Viewed by Dubai, that's the season's big hit as any farce with top officials in the

[01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:38.590]
Bush administration and their hysterical courtiers and the mass media, asserting positions

[01:02:38.590 --> 01:02:40.770]
that are patently absurd, but hilarious to watch.

[01:02:40.930 --> 01:02:41.930]
Audiences are eating it up.

[01:02:42.330 --> 01:02:43.810]
Great fun, but not for everyone.

[01:02:44.290 --> 01:02:45.730]
Feel the pain over at Fox Television.

[01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:49.490]
How do you go on stoking xenophobic hysteria against the Arabs when the golden boy in the

[01:02:49.490 --> 01:02:52.790]
White House has turned over management of six American ports to an amier who wants

[01:02:52.790 --> 01:02:53.470]
back the Taliban?

[01:02:54.150 --> 01:02:54.330]
OK.

[01:02:54.530 --> 01:02:55.330]
So now he's a good guy.

[01:02:55.490 --> 01:02:58.930]
Responding to that, he bushes charity pitch by throwing 100 million bucks to a Katrina

[01:02:58.930 --> 01:03:01.890]
victims and before that another million of the Bush presidential library.

[01:03:02.370 --> 01:03:05.970]
But how do you sell that to a Fox Television audience, brainwashed to believe that Saadah

[01:03:05.970 --> 01:03:09.050]
Hussein is indistinguishable from Osama bin Laden because they both speak Arabic?

[01:03:09.770 --> 01:03:13.270]
All to be Lou Dobbs over at CNN who never liked anyone connected with them at least,

[01:03:13.350 --> 01:03:16.790]
including the president and who now sends reporters out in the dark of night to track mysterious

[01:03:16.790 --> 01:03:17.190]
cargo.

[01:03:17.650 --> 01:03:21.230]
Some guys have all the fun, especially those traders who don't realize there's a war

[01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:24.550]
on and then it's our patriotic duty to support the president, even if he's endangering

[01:03:24.550 --> 01:03:24.950]
the country.

[01:03:26.310 --> 01:03:29.750]
Now, maybe this poor deal isn't really that big of threat to US security, but then either

[01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:30.350]
was Hussein.

[01:03:30.790 --> 01:03:33.870]
That didn't stop Bush from ripping up Iraq and turning it into a showcase for religious

[01:03:34.290 --> 01:03:34.650]
fratricide.

[01:03:35.010 --> 01:03:36.510]
So he makes mistakes, but he's our president.

[01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:40.190]
And we are in a war, a war on terror, terror, terror, terror all the time.

[01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:42.190]
But now we're getting mixed messages.

[01:03:42.590 --> 01:03:45.190]
First the president told us that in the war on terror, you trust your own government

[01:03:45.190 --> 01:03:46.270]
to provide Homeland Security.

[01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:50.250]
You put your faith in the stir and electronic, one-waving Americans in white shirts and

[01:03:50.850 --> 01:03:52.810]
TSA epilots who check your shoes at the airport.

[01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:57.390]
Those upstanding Americans who report to other upstanding Americans, such as Homeland Security

[01:03:57.390 --> 01:03:59.770]
Secretary Michael Sherdov and people he trusts.

[01:04:00.250 --> 01:04:03.430]
Now they tell us it's okay to have some Arab as a guy in charge of checking our shoes,

[01:04:03.730 --> 01:04:04.410]
excuse me, ports.

[01:04:05.310 --> 01:04:08.850]
Yeah, I know to be the least bit queasy about turning over our ports to guys who supported

[01:04:08.850 --> 01:04:12.370]
the Taliban when that bunch of religious maniacs were harboring bin Laden as the Bush

[01:04:12.370 --> 01:04:14.250]
apologists tell us just xenophobic.

[01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:18.210]
Dubai was not alone, Saudi Arabian Pakistan did the same and other trusted allies.

[01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:22.550]
These are crazy times and they're some unnerving out of these in Bush's foreign policy, but

[01:04:22.550 --> 01:04:23.050]
don't worry.

[01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:26.810]
As soon as Hussein is tried and hanged, democracy will flower in the Arab world and

[01:04:26.810 --> 01:04:28.050]
the war on terrorism will be over.

[01:04:28.570 --> 01:04:31.490]
In the meantime, we have to put up with some contradictions, such as trusting Arab

[01:04:31.490 --> 01:04:34.630]
strong port management companies, even as we scapegoat them everywhere else.

[01:04:35.230 --> 01:04:38.010]
Even if you're 18, see what's seen near and a bit nervous about it.

[01:04:38.190 --> 01:04:40.970]
Remember that the Bushes have made it clear that the management companies don't have anything

[01:04:40.970 --> 01:04:44.730]
to report security because that's safely in the hands of U.S. Customs and U.S. Coast Guard.

[01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:46.230]
Oops, not according to the Coast Guard.

[01:04:46.790 --> 01:04:50.470]
Just like when things looked like they were quieting down, Senator Susan Collins of

[01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:53.630]
Maine, chairman of the Senate, ha, Homeland Security Committee, had to go and mess it up

[01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:56.990]
for the president by releasing details of a very embarrassing Coast Guard warning that

[01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:57.870]
the White House had ignored.

[01:04:58.350 --> 01:05:02.230]
There are many intelligence gaps concerning the potential for Dubai-Port's world assets

[01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:06.170]
to support terrorist operations that preclude an overall threat assessment of the potential

[01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:08.130]
merger state of the Coast Guard document.

[01:05:08.770 --> 01:05:11.210]
No biggie, I get it when it comes to national security.

[01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:12.150]
Who are you going to trust?

[01:05:12.250 --> 01:05:15.450]
The president of the U.S. are Commander-in-Chief, or those say their boys in the Coast Guard

[01:05:15.450 --> 01:05:16.610]
are already backing off.

[01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:19.130]
But this is a very unpopular lame-buck president.

[01:05:19.310 --> 01:05:20.810]
Some Republican legislators are getting nervous.

[01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:24.930]
For example, Collins, who broke ranks to warn, this report suggests there were significant

[01:05:24.930 --> 01:05:28.390]
and troubling intelligence gaps that language is very troubling to me.

[01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:29.950]
Hey, no problem, reassures.

[01:05:30.050 --> 01:05:31.790]
Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona.

[01:05:32.110 --> 01:05:34.510]
It could be worse the port managers could be Chinese communists.

[01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:38.090]
The Chinese are even less free than the people of Dubai he insists that we dodge the

[01:05:38.090 --> 01:05:38.550]
bullet there.

[01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:42.850]
Some sports might even point out that Beijing never recognized the Taliban and hardly

[01:05:42.850 --> 01:05:43.990]
cuddles religious fanatics.

[01:05:44.350 --> 01:05:47.030]
But that would ruin this wonderful force and I wish it a very long run.

[01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:48.090]
You buy Dubai?

[01:05:48.490 --> 01:05:50.210]
Yeah, I love every minute, says Robert Scher.

[01:05:50.550 --> 01:05:51.570]
He's buying us great.

[01:05:52.410 --> 01:05:52.710]
And acute?

[01:05:53.510 --> 01:05:54.110]
He's good.

[01:05:54.110 --> 01:05:57.050]
Too good for the LA Times, but they're not too good for us.

[01:05:58.010 --> 01:06:00.090]
11th, 13th, at 5th, 60th, WDQN.

[01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:01.770]
Beach Ford has gone mad.

[01:06:02.030 --> 01:06:03.970]
Madness in March, all this month at Beach Ford.

[01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:07.130]
They dismissed having a record month last month so they planned to break that record this

[01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:07.350]
month.

[01:06:07.870 --> 01:06:13.150]
Right now, extended camp Ford F-150s, that was lower 249 bucks a month, with just $995

[01:06:13.150 --> 01:06:15.390]
down plus fees for the Proof Credit and 39 Monthlies.

[01:06:15.790 --> 01:06:17.830]
Madness in March at Beach Ford's mean you must be mad.

[01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:22.050]
You gotta be nuts if you don't take advantage of rebates and discounts up to $10,000 on

[01:06:22.050 --> 01:06:23.390]
all new and used vehicles.

[01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:27.070]
Now, if you're not in the market for a new copy, no somebody who is, be sure and set

[01:06:27.070 --> 01:06:27.690]
them into Beach Ford.

[01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:31.670]
Because if they take delivery this month through March, Beach Ford will send you 200 bucks.

[01:06:31.970 --> 01:06:34.890]
That money comes from Beach Ford's advertising budget so it won't affect your friend's

[01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:35.090]
price.

[01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:36.890]
Don't miss out on this once a year ahead.

[01:06:37.050 --> 01:06:42.330]
Beach Ford's madness in March, extended camp Ford F-150s as low as just 249 bucks a

[01:06:42.330 --> 01:06:46.750]
month, discounts and rebates up to $10 grand and 200 bucks cash just for referring a friend.

[01:06:47.030 --> 01:06:51.270]
So hurry in, Beach Ford is located just two miles east of the Golden Grades on 163rd Street

[01:06:51.270 --> 01:06:52.030]
and West Dixie Highway.

[01:06:52.030 --> 01:06:54.910]
Guarantea, you will love your Beach Ford experience.

[01:06:55.310 --> 01:06:57.410]
This is Neil Rogers.

[01:06:58.430 --> 01:07:01.230]
This is 5.16.28.

[01:07:01.870 --> 01:07:05.810]
So Rogers got it.

[01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:08.710]
Hi boys and girls, fifth me, Mecha Mouse.

[01:07:09.250 --> 01:07:12.010]
From this is the latest thing parked in beautiful Damascus area.

[01:07:12.390 --> 01:07:14.130]
It's a small mind after all.

[01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:17.370]
Now we're past them taking the kids to Disney Damascus.

[01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:18.970]
You know, because they blow up so fast.

[01:07:18.970 --> 01:07:25.370]
Come see Space Mountain K-Pide House, Mr. Ben Laden's wild ride, Scuds like your Space Ranger

[01:07:25.370 --> 01:07:30.890]
spin, insurgents of the Caribbean and especially Indiana Jones in the Temple of Bloom.

[01:07:31.730 --> 01:07:36.410]
And by the way, sure, please film that trips into relative death for not wearing a Berknaat.

[01:07:36.650 --> 01:07:38.330]
But what the hell is the matter with you people?

[01:07:38.890 --> 01:07:42.830]
I don't know what you've been smoking, but ever since Goopy blew himself up, held on

[01:07:42.830 --> 01:07:47.490]
now, and I have been trying to spread the word that cartoons are about as real as Walt's

[01:07:47.490 --> 01:07:50.150]
last acid-induced, technical and green people.

[01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:53.630]
So come visit us at Disney World Damascus.

[01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:57.870]
Where Donald Duck doesn't wear pants but our women are covered and where tomorrow land

[01:07:57.870 --> 01:07:59.570]
is set in 1352.

[01:08:00.270 --> 01:08:02.590]
And for all you infidels, am I see?

[01:08:03.170 --> 01:08:04.010]
See you soon.

[01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:05.510]
Hey, why?

[01:08:06.350 --> 01:08:06.610]
Why?

[01:08:07.090 --> 01:08:08.190]
Because we hate you.

[01:08:08.530 --> 01:08:10.130]
Him or you, S.

[01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:11.690]
Talk, rap.

[01:08:12.570 --> 01:08:13.790]
Hey, don't be doing that, you S.

[01:08:13.790 --> 01:08:16.050]
I think it really has been out of shape, especially on the Earth Street.

[01:08:17.850 --> 01:08:21.330]
1119 at 560, everybody come early and I want to have a way for Marlon's baseball.

[01:08:21.810 --> 01:08:26.270]
Oh, hey, hey, smell of the, uh, smell of leather and joist raps and sweat and all that good

[01:08:26.270 --> 01:08:26.570]
stuff.

[01:08:28.590 --> 01:08:28.950]
What?

[01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:33.630]
And all the guys taking showers together in the locker room and snapping their ass with

[01:08:33.630 --> 01:08:34.350]
a body wash, I'm sure.

[01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:36.310]
I mean snapping their ****, but with the towel.

[01:08:36.510 --> 01:08:37.230]
Don't want to say yes.

[01:08:37.590 --> 01:08:39.230]
We're up to 260 out there, by the way.

[01:08:39.610 --> 01:08:40.570]
Well, that's not too exciting.

[01:08:41.310 --> 01:08:41.670]
No, it's not.

[01:08:42.690 --> 01:08:46.690]
260, we had 2000 yesterday, we only had 26, I think that's a crap location, if you ask

[01:08:46.690 --> 01:08:46.830]
me.

[01:08:46.930 --> 01:08:48.010]
I don't know why the hell it came up with that.

[01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:49.810]
Most of our people are not on the way to the Marlon game.

[01:08:50.610 --> 01:08:51.370]
Well, they ought to be.

[01:08:51.930 --> 01:08:52.090]
What?

[01:08:52.290 --> 01:08:53.130]
No, they shouldn't have to be.

[01:08:53.250 --> 01:08:56.090]
It's an exhibition game and there's going to be like a, you know, a smattering of people

[01:08:56.090 --> 01:08:57.450]
out there and nobody gives a crap.

[01:08:57.610 --> 01:08:59.350]
It's a middle of the day on a Thursday, okay?

[01:08:59.630 --> 01:09:03.150]
Or even take off from work to go to a Marlon's exhibition game, a preseason game.

[01:09:04.250 --> 01:09:07.330]
They don't even take off from work to go to that kind of regular season, even like if

[01:09:07.330 --> 01:09:09.590]
it's a playoff battle going on, they're not going to do that.

[01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:13.730]
Unlike in real baseball cities like Chicago, we're just routinely they take off to go to

[01:09:13.730 --> 01:09:14.890]
those afternoon games, right Josh?

[01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:15.730]
That's right.

[01:09:15.930 --> 01:09:16.290]
Right.

[01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:20.390]
So you're not going to be working in Marlon's at all this year.

[01:09:20.790 --> 01:09:21.770]
I will not be now.

[01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:22.350]
Wow.

[01:09:22.570 --> 01:09:23.510]
I'll be going as you games.

[01:09:23.590 --> 01:09:24.770]
You don't have to hold back.

[01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:27.250]
You can actually tell me how boring Dave Van Boring really is.

[01:09:27.310 --> 01:09:27.930]
I'll have my credential.

[01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:29.050]
I can just go for free.

[01:09:29.370 --> 01:09:31.150]
You know, that's how he just pretending to hear what I said.

[01:09:31.450 --> 01:09:32.330]
It's slipped that way.

[01:09:32.930 --> 01:09:36.250]
I could get on a phone with that bank so fast, faster than Grant took Richmond, man.

[01:09:37.190 --> 01:09:39.130]
Now, I don't want to put words in your mouth.

[01:09:39.230 --> 01:09:40.870]
I'm sure that you and guys got along really well.

[01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:41.590]
I don't want to end it.

[01:09:41.610 --> 01:09:45.530]
You never know that you might want to bring your bridges, baby, especially the way things are going for us now.

[01:09:45.690 --> 01:09:45.790]
You know?

[01:09:47.290 --> 01:09:50.570]
They got poor Josh there between power and us, between a rock and a hard place.

[01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:52.110]
Rock solid.

[01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:56.850]
You got poor little Georgie there who's in a state of delusion who can't understand why his kishies are twisted.

[01:09:57.010 --> 01:09:58.850]
It can't be after eight years of working at QAM.

[01:09:59.530 --> 01:10:01.970]
And then of course me who just yesterday went from this U for it.

[01:10:02.170 --> 01:10:04.090]
Oh, we all love you in 30 years.

[01:10:04.090 --> 01:10:06.570]
Where is it, you know, like Chris, I know now this.

[01:10:07.930 --> 01:10:09.590]
I just sent Norma can to another email.

[01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:11.930]
You know something I think Jay, who just I got his facts.

[01:10:12.090 --> 01:10:13.090]
I think you inspired me, Jay.

[01:10:13.230 --> 01:10:15.070]
I think Norma, your days are numbered like in single digits.

[01:10:15.230 --> 01:10:15.590]
You're an idiot.

[01:10:17.550 --> 01:10:20.690]
That's Norma can't who didn't even know there was my 30th anniversary in the market yesterday.

[01:10:20.850 --> 01:10:23.250]
It was busy emailing me stories that I already had on our website.

[01:10:23.610 --> 01:10:24.170]
That kind of stuff.

[01:10:24.750 --> 01:10:26.110]
You're just a blivvious Norma.

[01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:28.830]
Oh, and of course Norma is probably on a way to the Marlins game today.

[01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:29.530]
That's right.

[01:10:29.610 --> 01:10:30.570]
He's not going to get no email.

[01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:32.630]
He's on a way to the Marlins game.

[01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:34.210]
Maybe I'll stop by and buy your CD.

[01:10:34.650 --> 01:10:36.930]
Plans you and your baseball may have been out there.

[01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:37.970]
I forgot about that.

[01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:41.070]
So it's that'll postpone the inevitable for another day.

[01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:45.070]
Jay says this is the same Jay who I'm sure facts yesterday.

[01:10:45.610 --> 01:10:49.150]
I hate to say this, but you brought all this possessed on more than supervision upon yourself.

[01:10:50.290 --> 01:10:50.690]
Right.

[01:10:51.210 --> 01:10:56.290]
The reason I say this because you continue to employ an agent who's about as powerless as FDNL during a light thunderstorm.

[01:10:57.110 --> 01:11:02.570]
If you had a real shark on your side management would fall like a lawn chair and you'd be happily coasting into your 31st year.

[01:11:02.930 --> 01:11:07.190]
I've never seen an entertainment company let alone any company treat their top earner like this.

[01:11:07.690 --> 01:11:15.030]
Coming from a huge fan, their inexhaustible vocal suppression is affecting your show significantly, which is correct, and that makes me throw up in my mouth a little bit.

[01:11:15.930 --> 01:11:16.790]
Kind of like Dan Rather.

[01:11:17.930 --> 01:11:19.290]
Just wait till there is no more Neil Jobelle.

[01:11:19.990 --> 01:11:21.330]
QM will just be another $7.90.

[01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:22.770]
You get a real agent ASIP.

[01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:24.030]
Says Jay, I think you're right.

[01:11:24.210 --> 01:11:24.630]
I think you're right.

[01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:24.870]
I think you're, you know.

[01:11:26.490 --> 01:11:28.010]
Popped the jenko look what I got.

[01:11:28.210 --> 01:11:29.510]
I need a wartime concertier.

[01:11:30.290 --> 01:11:31.890]
And I wasn't even looking for wartime.

[01:11:31.930 --> 01:11:34.350]
Like I said, pay me on time and leave me alone, leave the show alone.

[01:11:34.670 --> 01:11:35.870]
But no, that's not good enough.

[01:11:36.110 --> 01:11:37.010]
We've got to have clearance.

[01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:38.030]
Get that whip out.

[01:11:38.130 --> 01:11:39.350]
I'm sorry, you can't do the whipping sound.

[01:11:40.210 --> 01:11:40.810]
Oh, was it?

[01:11:41.050 --> 01:11:41.150]
Huh?

[01:11:41.290 --> 01:11:42.730]
Fire it off, but you know what I mean?

[01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:43.330]
No.

[01:11:43.630 --> 01:11:43.630]

[01:11:44.110 --> 01:11:44.470]
No.

[01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:47.650]
Can't do that.

[01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:56.650]
There's no point in trying to discuss the finite aspects of those things because obviously we're

[01:11:56.650 --> 01:11:58.690]
working for people now who don't understand the difference.

[01:11:59.850 --> 01:12:01.670]
So that having been said, what's the use?

[01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:04.210]
You know, I'm saying that having been said, how do you make any decision?

[01:12:04.770 --> 01:12:07.170]
In other words, when in doubt, just don't play it, no matter what it is.

[01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:09.930]
So tell Bokit, he'll like to do a lot of Mary Poppins bits.

[01:12:12.130 --> 01:12:12.370]
All right.

[01:12:12.450 --> 01:12:13.090]
I have a good idea.

[01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:15.630]
A lot of Mary Poppins, a lot of like light and fluffy stuff.

[01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:19.510]
That's not too cartoonish though because we don't want to piss off the earth's tree.

[01:12:20.490 --> 01:12:21.590]
You want to like PO the Earth's tree.

[01:12:21.890 --> 01:12:23.030]
So we got 260, you said?

[01:12:23.790 --> 01:12:23.950]
Yeah.

[01:12:24.230 --> 01:12:25.290]
So far, it's pretty weak.

[01:12:25.410 --> 01:12:26.310]
I'd like to see a lot more.

[01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:32.150]
I started to say that Van is a fissurco-k on Oriole Boulevard and Commercial Western Powerline Road.

[01:12:32.230 --> 01:12:35.250]
That's right on the way to where the stadium up there right in Marlon's area to be playing the Orioles today.

[01:12:35.490 --> 01:12:36.070]
So very light.

[01:12:36.710 --> 01:12:38.570]
We had two Van's out at the same time yesterday.

[01:12:38.910 --> 01:12:42.510]
So I understand that yesterday was the anniversary day.

[01:12:42.510 --> 01:12:47.590]
Yesterday was a very positive day as opposed to it's the year in the year in baby as opposed to they'd be in a very negative day.

[01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:49.010]
A highly negative day.

[01:12:50.430 --> 01:12:55.630]
Had no response to either one of my emails from Norman that of course is because she's on the way to the ballgame to, you know, put on to...

[01:12:55.630 --> 01:12:57.590]
Maybe she's probably hiding out in the locker room there.

[01:12:57.650 --> 01:12:59.090]
Maybe she wants to take a shower with some of the guys.

[01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:01.330]
I don't know.

[01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:04.730]
I haven't seen too many Marlins that I want to take any showers with, to be honest with them.

[01:13:06.230 --> 01:13:07.710]
Maybe Mantine, he's long gone.

[01:13:07.970 --> 01:13:09.190]
Remember I couldn't remember his name last year.

[01:13:09.190 --> 01:13:11.350]
See the progress I'm making? I'm making personal progress.

[01:13:11.690 --> 01:13:15.870]
My memories coming back on this sharp as a mots of ball and yet on the other hand.

[01:13:17.670 --> 01:13:18.070]
Boy.

[01:13:18.810 --> 01:13:22.290]
I just want to read that one sentence over and over again till the 1250.

[01:13:24.150 --> 01:13:25.530]
About being way over the top.

[01:13:26.950 --> 01:13:29.050]
See there's obviously one question.

[01:13:29.230 --> 01:13:31.670]
Why do we need to go away over the top?

[01:13:31.810 --> 01:13:34.850]
Why is it that all the other radio stations on the year in America with or without their license?

[01:13:34.850 --> 01:13:41.910]
Why is it that they are attempting to abide or at least we hope they are by the FCC guidelines as mysterious and as stringent as they are?

[01:13:42.250 --> 01:13:44.090]
And we have to go way over the top.

[01:13:44.910 --> 01:13:50.770]
And that's because we have to be told for the prior sins of Pharrell and Stern and this one and that one and that one and that and so on.

[01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:52.930]
Which I have no idea what that has to do with this show.

[01:13:54.550 --> 01:13:59.350]
Speaking of Fox, Fair and Slanted says the raw story.

[01:13:59.530 --> 01:14:02.570]
Fox executive is funneled cash to San Torment and the GOP.

[01:14:03.870 --> 01:14:15.050]
Fox News host and commentator Sean Hannity may have been recently singled out but he isn't the only news corporation employee petting the reelection coffers of Rick Santorum, farbicin Republican and Pennsylvania raw story has learned.

[01:14:15.630 --> 01:14:28.630]
A sample, a simple search of federal elections commission records reveals that many news corporation employees including chairman and chief executive officer Rupert Murdoch have made direct personal donations to the senator's reelection campaign as well as other mostly Republican candidates.

[01:14:29.310 --> 01:14:34.670]
Records indicate that in November 2005 Murdoch personally donated 2100 bucks to Santorum's campaign.

[01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:37.410]
This wasn't the first monetary gift Murdoch made to Santorum.

[01:14:37.690 --> 01:14:41.110]
The right wing media mogul shelled out a thousand bucks to help elect a senator in 2000.

[01:14:42.450 --> 01:14:48.750]
Santorum isn't the only Republican candidate that Murdoch is putting his money behind in addition to a $5,000 donation to the Republican National Committee.

[01:14:49.190 --> 01:14:56.970]
Murdoch is also given generously the Longhorn Political Action Committee which distributes funds exclusively to Republican candidates and seems to favor candidates in Texas.

[01:14:56.970 --> 01:14:58.550]
You'll long horns.

[01:14:59.210 --> 01:15:13.190]
A review of declared donations indicates that with few exceptions such as churn-ins donations to Berman for Congress and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and great-of-an-session donation resists your campaign for Senate, higher-ups if the so-called fair and balanced cable news outlet overwhelmingly give to the GOP.

[01:15:14.150 --> 01:15:22.450]
Two FOSS government relations executives have also given a Santorum Michael Regan and Paul Jackson have billed out 211500 to the senator's reelection campaign respectively.

[01:15:22.450 --> 01:15:26.970]
Regan is also donated a thousand bucks each to the Republican National Committee and Longhorn Pat.

[01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:37.030]
A review of declared donations indicates that with few exceptions FOSS higher-ups overwhelmingly give Republican what a shock, what a surprise, huh? Aren't you just blown away?

[01:15:37.410 --> 01:15:39.010]
Yeah, the surprise.

[01:15:39.370 --> 01:15:40.710]
Or use that kind of language.

[01:15:41.370 --> 01:15:42.230]
David in Miami says,

[01:15:44.190 --> 01:15:48.010]
I know you're not a fan of the cruise industry however myself and millions of others are.

[01:15:48.590 --> 01:15:56.010]
As many of us look at this port deal as a problem for incoming cargo a friendly reminder should go out to the crew that the cruise ships are docked ports that will be guarded by Dubai.

[01:15:56.770 --> 01:16:04.210]
I have a cruise plan in a few months and the thought of sitting in that ship for many hours before they cast off the ropes is making me feel a little more uneasy, a little queasy about the old trips as David.

[01:16:04.590 --> 01:16:09.230]
I wish that Carnival World Tour be in the other cruise line companies would make a little noise about how about a lot of noise David?

[01:16:10.250 --> 01:16:14.170]
How about the port deal since it might put a damper on their bottom line as well.

[01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:15.770]
Good point, huh?

[01:16:17.130 --> 01:16:26.230]
Who wants to sit on a bunch of cruise ships when he got all his schmachta heads running around serving in falafel balls and it's a warmer and hummus and haggis.

[01:16:28.510 --> 01:16:31.130]
You want to travel on the world hummus line?

[01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:32.070]
Oh, they're thinking.

[01:16:32.770 --> 01:16:33.810]
Who will they consider?

[01:16:35.730 --> 01:16:37.250]
It's been sent down to appetizing to me.

[01:16:37.450 --> 01:16:38.090]
Maybe they can hold us.

[01:16:38.210 --> 01:16:39.050]
How are Dean to win that poll?

[01:16:39.170 --> 01:16:40.150]
How is Kicking Asperg?

[01:16:40.250 --> 01:16:41.150]
Baby, I'm telling you, he's the man.

[01:16:42.610 --> 01:16:43.170]
That's right.

[01:16:43.670 --> 01:16:44.530]
He is the man.

[01:16:45.130 --> 01:16:45.990]
I told you that before.

[01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:49.970]
If he'd run the last time he'd be the president right now, we wouldn't be in Iraq.

[01:16:50.150 --> 01:16:50.750]
I guarantee you that.

[01:16:51.570 --> 01:16:52.530]
That's for damn sure.

[01:16:52.930 --> 01:16:53.330]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:16:55.210 --> 01:16:58.130]
Who's the Democratic Party's presidential candidate being 2008?

[01:16:58.290 --> 01:17:00.310]
It's never too early to start thinking about replacing W.

[01:17:01.890 --> 01:17:03.570]
I'm going to make a thousand before we get out of here.

[01:17:03.970 --> 01:17:04.310]
Thanks God.

[01:17:05.770 --> 01:17:07.330]
Howard Dean, 207.

[01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:08.790]
Now we're talking.

[01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:11.690]
Makes no difference, 178.

[01:17:12.050 --> 01:17:12.870]
Hillary Clinton, 160.

[01:17:13.290 --> 01:17:13.810]
Al Gore 83.

[01:17:14.290 --> 01:17:14.650]
Barack Obama.

[01:17:14.810 --> 01:17:16.670]
It probably makes no difference because they'll fix the vote again.

[01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:17.270]
That's right.

[01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:19.830]
They'll get the all the voting machines all over the days.

[01:17:20.550 --> 01:17:21.270]
Al Gore 83.

[01:17:21.510 --> 01:17:22.550]
Barack Obama, 75.

[01:17:22.750 --> 01:17:23.470]
Westerly Clark, 62.

[01:17:23.650 --> 01:17:25.150]
He eats a hell of a deli sandwich, man.

[01:17:25.490 --> 01:17:26.970]
He likes that pastrami on a rye.

[01:17:28.150 --> 01:17:29.150]
Joe Biden, 49.

[01:17:29.150 --> 01:17:30.210]
John Edwards, 41.

[01:17:30.370 --> 01:17:31.070]
I don't care, 40.

[01:17:31.290 --> 01:17:32.290]
I hate this poll, 35.

[01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:35.250]
Mark Warner of 17, 17 of Virginia.

[01:17:35.770 --> 01:17:39.950]
And John Kerry in last place, Solomente de ACC.

[01:17:41.710 --> 01:17:42.550]
How do you like that?

[01:17:42.710 --> 01:17:44.190]
16 for John Kerry.

[01:17:45.390 --> 01:17:46.810]
Can't imagine why they lost that last election.

[01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:49.210]
This is Neil Rogers.

[01:17:50.250 --> 01:17:52.390]
This is 5.62.

[01:17:52.910 --> 01:17:55.150]
A.M.

[01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:57.270]
Hard or a liver?

[01:17:57.270 --> 01:17:58.410]
No.

[01:18:00.130 --> 01:18:02.110]
Well, take the train.

[01:18:03.150 --> 01:18:04.150]
You won't carpool.

[01:18:05.010 --> 01:18:06.430]
You'll see a Hummer.

[01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:08.890]
You start to drool.

[01:18:09.330 --> 01:18:12.690]
You won't walk for 20 feet.

[01:18:13.870 --> 01:18:16.770]
You'd rather take your SUV.

[01:18:17.970 --> 01:18:19.150]
You can't drive.

[01:18:20.230 --> 01:18:23.390]
You can't eat without crude.

[01:18:24.030 --> 01:18:25.270]
You're indeed.

[01:18:26.170 --> 01:18:32.210]
You need it for your plastics with draw symptoms.

[01:18:32.850 --> 01:18:34.390]
Make me sick.

[01:18:34.950 --> 01:18:35.790]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

[01:18:35.790 --> 01:18:39.350]
You like to think there's lots more fun through the soil.

[01:18:39.650 --> 01:18:40.350]
Oh, yeah.

[01:18:40.970 --> 01:18:42.030]
That's what you think.

[01:18:42.710 --> 01:18:43.710]
I think the truth, though.

[01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:47.670]
Closer to the truth is to say your total is fall.

[01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:50.270]
You know, you're gonna have to place it.

[01:18:50.410 --> 01:18:54.590]
You're addicted to all might as well face it.

[01:18:54.590 --> 01:18:58.890]
You're addicted to all might as well face it.

[01:18:58.930 --> 01:19:03.150]
You're addicted to all might as well face it.

[01:19:03.210 --> 01:19:07.430]
You're addicted to the advanced with them girls might as well face it.

[01:19:07.450 --> 01:19:08.950]
You're addicted to all.

[01:19:09.310 --> 01:19:10.010]
I'll be going.

[01:19:10.870 --> 01:19:12.850]
1132, 28 to aluminum QAM.

[01:19:13.450 --> 01:19:14.570]
Got any more updates?

[01:19:14.710 --> 01:19:16.310]
Now we're not gonna hear every break today.

[01:19:16.510 --> 01:19:17.130]
Like we did yesterday.

[01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:17.790]
No, we are.

[01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:18.310]
We're getting in.

[01:19:18.450 --> 01:19:19.970]
We're at 300 right now.

[01:19:20.350 --> 01:19:21.430]
That's pathetic.

[01:19:22.590 --> 01:19:24.370]
We had two 60 like half an hour ago.

[01:19:24.370 --> 01:19:25.090]
Now we got 300 bucks.

[01:19:25.090 --> 01:19:26.730]
I mean, it's sold two more things.

[01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:27.990]
We had two 60 last break.

[01:19:28.190 --> 01:19:28.250]
Yeah.

[01:19:28.410 --> 01:19:30.210]
Two more.

[01:19:30.630 --> 01:19:31.110]
Two more.

[01:19:31.510 --> 01:19:32.410]
Two more things.

[01:19:32.590 --> 01:19:33.490]
So, the CD and the T.

[01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:33.930]
Not a tour.

[01:19:34.170 --> 01:19:35.330]
Two CDs or two T-shirts.

[01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:36.330]
Or mixing match.

[01:19:36.330 --> 01:19:37.730]
Or maybe somebody just dropped off 40 bucks.

[01:19:38.450 --> 01:19:39.170]
Can't say that's a lot.

[01:19:39.250 --> 01:19:41.430]
That's pretty weak on the heels of yesterday's you four or two grand.

[01:19:41.650 --> 01:19:43.830]
I think it's a reflection of the whole tone of the show, you know.

[01:19:44.190 --> 01:19:45.750]
He doesn't like the tone of the show.

[01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:46.790]
Maybe that's what it is.

[01:19:48.230 --> 01:19:49.270]
I remember that.

[01:19:49.530 --> 01:19:49.870]
I forgot.

[01:19:50.030 --> 01:19:50.510]
Oh, yeah.

[01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:51.470]
That's right.

[01:19:51.470 --> 01:19:58.830]
That was another example of my agent's fantastic, a perspicacity and a perseverance who still

[01:19:58.830 --> 01:20:00.690]
hasn't responded to either one of my emails this morning.

[01:20:00.770 --> 01:20:01.610]
That's okay, Norma.

[01:20:01.710 --> 01:20:02.730]
You have a good time at the ball game.

[01:20:03.050 --> 01:20:05.410]
Take me out to the ball game treat.

[01:20:05.610 --> 01:20:06.610]
Me like a real girl.

[01:20:06.750 --> 01:20:07.350]
You know, like that.

[01:20:08.510 --> 01:20:10.070]
Get out of my life, Norma.

[01:20:10.170 --> 01:20:10.470]
Are you idiot?

[01:20:10.630 --> 01:20:11.370]
You know, a sentimentist check.

[01:20:11.530 --> 01:20:12.030]
All the big bucks.

[01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:14.070]
He's always at the beginning of the year.

[01:20:14.450 --> 01:20:15.730]
Push and push and when's that check?

[01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:16.030]
Come on.

[01:20:16.050 --> 01:20:18.090]
I said I'm going to check thousands of dollars.

[01:20:18.490 --> 01:20:19.730]
And this is what I get in response.

[01:20:19.930 --> 01:20:20.130]
Nothing.

[01:20:20.130 --> 01:20:21.010]
A big nothing.

[01:20:22.870 --> 01:20:24.010]
I'm like alien, man.

[01:20:24.150 --> 01:20:26.030]
I'm out there floating on a rubber raft all by myself.

[01:20:26.170 --> 01:20:27.010]
Well, George can relate to that.

[01:20:27.070 --> 01:20:27.230]
Right.

[01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:28.710]
Maybe the dolphins will come to rescue you.

[01:20:29.190 --> 01:20:29.770]
That could be.

[01:20:30.690 --> 01:20:32.210]
Maybe Brian Cox will come back.

[01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:35.730]
Study speaking of stupidity.

[01:20:35.890 --> 01:20:38.830]
If you Americans know the first amendment, this is good.

[01:20:38.910 --> 01:20:39.410]
This is great.

[01:20:39.570 --> 01:20:40.270]
This is perfect.

[01:20:41.570 --> 01:20:44.930]
Americans apparently know more about the Simpsons than they do about the first amendment.

[01:20:46.050 --> 01:20:46.450]
FAMING!

[01:20:47.330 --> 01:20:51.450]
Only one in four Americans can name more than one of the five freedoms guaranteed by the first amendment.

[01:20:51.650 --> 01:20:54.130]
Freedom of speech, religion, press, assembly, and petition for redress agreements.

[01:20:54.810 --> 01:20:56.450]
Freedom of speech you would think would be.

[01:20:57.210 --> 01:20:57.550]
Sure.

[01:20:58.410 --> 01:20:58.470]
Right.

[01:20:58.710 --> 01:21:00.290]
Of course that's passing, but never less.

[01:21:00.910 --> 01:21:04.130]
But more than half can name at least two members of the cartoon family according to a survey.

[01:21:05.630 --> 01:21:06.810]
Homer Marge Maggie.

[01:21:08.490 --> 01:21:08.930]
Santa's.

[01:21:09.090 --> 01:21:09.810]
Little helper.

[01:21:10.290 --> 01:21:10.870]
Little helper.

[01:21:11.050 --> 01:21:11.350]
Is the dog.

[01:21:12.250 --> 01:21:12.430]
Oh.

[01:21:13.890 --> 01:21:14.630]
Isn't that cute?

[01:21:14.630 --> 01:21:18.890]
I only know Homer and Marge, and that's it.

[01:21:19.090 --> 01:21:19.610]
Bart Leithler.

[01:21:20.150 --> 01:21:21.170]
No, oh yeah, Bart.

[01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:22.930]
Or even I know that.

[01:21:25.470 --> 01:21:28.710]
Finally, Gills moving up to the big leagues boy.

[01:21:30.350 --> 01:21:30.870]
Okay.

[01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:33.970]
And that's when the judge came at me.

[01:21:34.010 --> 01:21:34.510]
Okay, relax.

[01:21:35.330 --> 01:21:39.770]
The study about the New McCormick Tribute Freedom Museum found that 22% of Americans could name all five.

[01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:41.190]
Now that scares me.

[01:21:41.410 --> 01:21:41.430]
Okay.

[01:21:41.890 --> 01:21:49.010]
22% of Americans could name all five Simpson family members compared with just one in a thousand who could name all five first amendment freedoms.

[01:21:49.610 --> 01:21:50.090]
Yeah.

[01:21:50.210 --> 01:21:52.450]
Oh my god.

[01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:54.650]
That school system sure does the job.

[01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:58.370]
Oh yeah, you can't complain about American education because there isn't any.

[01:21:58.490 --> 01:22:02.190]
Okay, that's why not that you people necessarily so stupid is just that nobody touching up.

[01:22:03.090 --> 01:22:04.190]
Some of you.

[01:22:04.350 --> 01:22:07.950]
Joe Madira, director of exhibitions at the museum said he was surprised by the results.

[01:22:07.950 --> 01:22:13.010]
Part of the survey really shows that there are misconceptions and part of our mission is to clear up those misconceptions.

[01:22:13.450 --> 01:22:17.450]
Ed Madira, whose museum will be dedicated to helping visitors understand the first amendment when it opens in April.

[01:22:17.730 --> 01:22:19.470]
It means we have our job cut out for us.

[01:22:20.150 --> 01:22:20.670]
No, oh yeah.

[01:22:21.430 --> 01:22:26.630]
The survey found more people would name the three American idol judges than identify three first amendment rights.

[01:22:28.250 --> 01:22:30.270]
Like freedom of speech religion and the press.

[01:22:30.490 --> 01:22:34.750]
I mean, if you're going to about assembly and petition for redrand, I'm going to those other two maybe a little less so well known.

[01:22:34.750 --> 01:22:37.350]
But I mean freedom of speech religion and the press.

[01:22:39.010 --> 01:22:41.890]
More people could name the three American idol judges.

[01:22:42.690 --> 01:22:45.530]
Oh, and speaking of that, I don't know if that's the show he's on.

[01:22:47.250 --> 01:22:51.910]
On the wheel of fortune, if you had to go, you'll never guess who was on who you can't stand and who looks about a hundred years old.

[01:22:52.990 --> 01:22:55.350]
And who's a real idiot, by the way, Lorenzo Lamas.

[01:22:55.630 --> 01:22:56.330]
Oh, yeah.

[01:22:56.590 --> 01:22:56.730]
Yeah.

[01:22:56.910 --> 01:22:58.790]
You talk about getting hit with the ugly stick.

[01:22:58.930 --> 01:23:04.390]
I don't know what happened to that child, but man, he looks like he's aged 75 years since he was wrestling with him snakes in that movie.

[01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:05.250]
He's obnoxious.

[01:23:05.570 --> 01:23:06.470]
He's objectionable.

[01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:07.390]
Okay.

[01:23:07.810 --> 01:23:09.530]
Well, I would go along with that now.

[01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:10.590]
Now they look like that.

[01:23:10.730 --> 01:23:13.990]
When he might have looked good once upon a time, he was like, oh, no, no, no, no.

[01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:15.650]
Don't tell me he might have looked good once upon a time.

[01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:16.850]
He looked retrust me.

[01:23:16.930 --> 01:23:17.550]
I'll give you that.

[01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:18.790]
Take it from an expert.

[01:23:19.050 --> 01:23:22.350]
But beyond the look was an obnoxious objectionable.

[01:23:22.350 --> 01:23:24.770]
And now he's obnoxious and objectionable and old and ugly.

[01:23:24.990 --> 01:23:26.090]
So forget about it.

[01:23:26.230 --> 01:23:27.150]
Screw you, Lorenzo.

[01:23:27.270 --> 01:23:27.750]
Welcome to the club.

[01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:34.110]
There were also more likely to remember popular advertising slogans than identify first amendment any of the rights.

[01:23:34.110 --> 01:23:34.970]
Like freedom of speech.

[01:23:35.630 --> 01:23:37.370]
See, I guess Bush is counting on that.

[01:23:37.470 --> 01:23:38.270]
I mean, we don't...

[01:23:38.270 --> 01:23:41.170]
Who cares about losing freedom of speech when we didn't know we had in the first place?

[01:23:41.930 --> 01:23:42.390]
That's right.

[01:23:42.810 --> 01:23:47.390]
It also showed that people misidentified first amendment rights about one in five thought the right to own a pet was protected.

[01:23:47.670 --> 01:23:48.850]
Ha ha ha ha ha!

[01:23:49.250 --> 01:23:49.470]
No!

[01:23:49.770 --> 01:23:50.010]
No!

[01:23:50.450 --> 01:23:50.810]
No!

[01:23:51.330 --> 01:23:51.490]
No more!

[01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:52.130]
No more!

[01:23:54.010 --> 01:23:56.350]
This is from the associated press.

[01:23:56.490 --> 01:23:57.210]
I'm not making this up.

[01:23:58.070 --> 01:23:59.030]
This is a study.

[01:24:00.510 --> 01:24:04.350]
About one in five thought the right to own a pet was protected by the Constitution.

[01:24:04.950 --> 01:24:09.990]
And 38% they believe the right against self-incrimination contained in the fifth amendment was a first amendment right.

[01:24:10.910 --> 01:24:15.550]
The telephone survey, but 1,000 morons was conducted January 20th, 22nd by the research firm,

[01:24:16.190 --> 01:24:19.470]
Sinovate and head of marginary error plus or minus three, muscle menus.

[01:24:20.130 --> 01:24:20.410]
Trace.

[01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:22.310]
That call.

[01:24:23.010 --> 01:24:23.790]
How do you like that?

[01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:29.490]
One in five people thought the right to own a pet is protected by the Constitution.

[01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:30.930]
Oh my goodness.

[01:24:32.510 --> 01:24:32.910]
Wow.

[01:24:34.410 --> 01:24:37.090]
And you wonder why people are watching American Idol?

[01:24:38.670 --> 01:24:39.650]
Yeah, he's still there.

[01:24:41.050 --> 01:24:42.190]
567, I'm giving the numbers out.

[01:24:42.230 --> 01:24:44.310]
I absolutely will not take any calls, but I give the numbers out.

[01:24:44.910 --> 01:24:47.350]
Let me just see how thick my pile is.

[01:24:47.410 --> 01:24:48.550]
Okay, before I decide that.

[01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:50.190]
You get a measure?

[01:24:51.170 --> 01:24:51.310]
Hmm?

[01:24:51.510 --> 01:24:51.850]
Get pile?

[01:24:51.850 --> 01:24:54.810]
No, maybe it's not that, but no, I don't think there's all that much more.

[01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:55.750]
And I guess it's an hour to go.

[01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:58.890]
Am I actually squeezing a few calls here or maybe just place some music like I said?

[01:25:00.110 --> 01:25:01.530]
Well, I don't think you're going to like this.

[01:25:01.970 --> 01:25:04.610]
Soldiers of veterans may face budget cuts in 2008.

[01:25:04.730 --> 01:25:05.950]
That's your original price.

[01:25:06.450 --> 01:25:07.410]
You're not supporting the military.

[01:25:07.630 --> 01:25:08.770]
And you know something.

[01:25:08.990 --> 01:25:10.230]
Now I do have time.

[01:25:10.330 --> 01:25:10.930]
All right.

[01:25:11.090 --> 01:25:11.650]
There is a God.

[01:25:11.810 --> 01:25:13.530]
There is a right deal.

[01:25:13.670 --> 01:25:13.890]
God.

[01:25:14.850 --> 01:25:15.950]
That's Cindy C. Incom.

[01:25:16.090 --> 01:25:16.810]
A common cause.

[01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:17.470]
Okay.

[01:25:18.050 --> 01:25:20.050]
The spirit of Christ can tell me to read that.

[01:25:20.050 --> 01:25:22.010]
But anyway, first, the bad news.

[01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:23.310]
There's so much of it.

[01:25:24.430 --> 01:25:26.770]
Veterans may face budget cuts in 2008.

[01:25:26.910 --> 01:25:27.650]
That's not so great.

[01:25:27.770 --> 01:25:31.410]
At least tens of thousands of veterans with non-critical medical issues could suffer

[01:25:31.410 --> 01:25:34.990]
to later even denied care in coming years to enable President Bush to meet his promise

[01:25:34.990 --> 01:25:38.710]
of cutting the deficit in half if the White House is serious about its proposed budget.

[01:25:39.730 --> 01:25:43.230]
After an increase for next year, the Bush budget would turn current trends on their head.

[01:25:43.550 --> 01:25:46.610]
Even though the Christ in providing medical care to veterans has been growing by leaps and bounds,

[01:25:46.610 --> 01:25:51.350]
White House budget documents assume a cut back in 2008 and further cuts thereafter.

[01:25:52.570 --> 01:25:58.050]
In fact, the proposed cuts are a Sodorak Kony and it seems to some that the White House is simply making them up

[01:25:58.050 --> 01:26:00.230]
to make its long-term deficit figures look better.

[01:26:00.630 --> 01:26:03.650]
More realistic numbers, however, would raise doubts as to whether Bush can keep his promise

[01:26:03.650 --> 01:26:06.610]
to wrestle the deficit under control by the time he leaves or office.

[01:26:08.270 --> 01:26:08.630]
Yeah.

[01:26:08.710 --> 01:26:09.990]
Let's screw over those veterans, man.

[01:26:10.090 --> 01:26:13.670]
Once you're over there like, hey, Ra Ra, sis boom ba, we support all you guys and gals.

[01:26:13.810 --> 01:26:15.250]
But once you come back, screw you.

[01:26:15.810 --> 01:26:17.850]
It's kind of like that anniversary thing with me yesterday.

[01:26:18.210 --> 01:26:20.530]
Oh, on Wednesday, March 1st, we love you, Neil.

[01:26:21.210 --> 01:26:21.910]
You're really great.

[01:26:22.110 --> 01:26:23.670]
And then March 2nd, screw you, man.

[01:26:24.270 --> 01:26:24.790]
Screw you.

[01:26:24.870 --> 01:26:26.110]
Don't mess with all our plans.

[01:26:26.530 --> 01:26:27.490]
We're the beesleys, baby.

[01:26:27.770 --> 01:26:29.010]
We're on a freaking stock exchange.

[01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:34.350]
We got a junior program director there whose rocket scientist can't even get his plane ticket on the right day.

[01:26:34.410 --> 01:26:34.950]
But he's a genius.

[01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:37.590]
Can't keep his Blackberry charged up so we can keep in touch.

[01:26:37.910 --> 01:26:38.790]
But he's a genius.

[01:26:40.030 --> 01:26:41.330]
You see, instead of messing with us,

[01:26:41.630 --> 01:26:44.790]
they ought to be messing with the guy that keeps taking off days and days at a time

[01:26:44.790 --> 01:26:47.310]
to go out and play a junior basketball guy, you know?

[01:26:47.470 --> 01:26:51.310]
But no, no, let's just keep dumping on Neil and George and Josh.

[01:26:51.530 --> 01:26:54.210]
And we're like a thorn in their side, you know?

[01:26:54.290 --> 01:26:54.890]
Don't forget Boker.

[01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:57.330]
They land around, of course, Boker, or chicken neck.

[01:26:57.590 --> 01:27:00.810]
They love the ratings and they love the revenue before they hate us like Poisonants.

[01:27:00.870 --> 01:27:03.870]
But all the protestations and you guys are red and I'm a baby.

[01:27:04.090 --> 01:27:04.930]

[01:27:06.190 --> 01:27:08.210]

[01:27:08.350 --> 01:27:09.730]

[01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:12.710]

[01:27:12.710 --> 01:27:19.590]
Even I am shocked at the tremendous fast turnaround in less than 24 hours from yesterday

[01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:27.490]
and all of that excitement and euphoria and crap to what today bringing us quickly back to reality.

[01:27:29.830 --> 01:27:33.630]
I mean, I think we're on one planet and I think that the new management team there on Uranus.

[01:27:35.210 --> 01:27:37.470]
Paul and L.A. says, be late and happy anniversary.

[01:27:37.710 --> 01:27:41.450]

Paul and family in L.A.

[01:28:05.250 --> 01:28:07.530]
She was a, she was number one, married to Jack Klutman.

[01:28:07.530 --> 01:28:09.130]
That was her biggest ending at the forest.

[01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:11.470]
And it's easy to see why and why he talks like that.

[01:28:11.710 --> 01:28:15.010]
And number two, she was a very marginal actress, B movie actress.

[01:28:15.950 --> 01:28:16.350]
Okay.

[01:28:16.830 --> 01:28:18.030]

Richard Dawson and that's a very good example.

[01:28:36.250 --> 01:28:37.070]
Sir, I said.

[01:28:38.750 --> 01:28:39.930]
That's slurring enough there.

[01:28:40.190 --> 01:28:40.370]
Right.

[01:28:40.890 --> 01:28:41.330]

I want to thank the guy that called him yesterday.

[01:48:00.750 --> 01:48:02.870]
I think it was two days ago.

[01:48:03.730 --> 01:48:07.050]
Maybe it was yesterday about the loose change on that website.

[01:48:08.750 --> 01:48:09.910]

Pawnlove views.

[01:48:53.950 --> 01:48:54.990]
Pawnlove views.

[01:48:54.990 --> 01:48:54.990]

[01:48:54.990 --> 01:49:06.270]
And you will need to have a michael online.

[01:49:06.270 --> 01:49:06.370]
You can have a shaman here because you won't have a real name forever.

[01:49:06.370 --> 01:49:06.370]

[01:49:06.370 --> 01:49:06.370]

[01:49:06.370 --> 01:49:06.670]
You will need to have a real name forever.

[01:49:06.670 --> 01:49:07.330]
You will need to have a real name forever.

[01:49:07.350 --> 01:49:09.890]
You will need to have a real name forever.

[01:49:10.730 --> 01:49:15.110]
You'll need to have a real name forever.

[01:49:16.750 --> 01:49:21.130]
You'll need to have a real name forever.

[01:49:21.130 --> 01:49:26.650]
And the fact that they wanted to go in there and invade Iraq and realign the whole Middle East and set it up under their thumb.

[01:49:26.950 --> 01:49:32.070]
And the only way they were going to be allowed to do that though was if we had some major catastrophe like a Pearl Harbor happened,

[01:49:32.230 --> 01:49:34.630]
because otherwise the American people wouldn't sit still for it.

[01:49:35.190 --> 01:49:39.370]
Wasn't it convenient for the Neocons and their puppets Bush and Cheney?

[01:49:39.590 --> 01:49:42.910]
Wasn't it convenient for them that 9-11-9-11-9-11 people died?

[01:49:44.350 --> 01:49:45.630]
I just mentioned that in passing.

[01:49:46.810 --> 01:49:52.030]
Doug Thompson writes in the rant, this is from yesterday, I never got to it because we had all those great calls and faxes coming in.

[01:49:52.190 --> 01:49:53.290]
And yesterday was the euphoric day.

[01:49:53.530 --> 01:49:55.030]
Today is a suicide inducing day.

[01:49:55.830 --> 01:49:58.150]
As Joe Bell once again talks a really good game.

[01:49:59.010 --> 01:49:59.810]
Hey, there old buddy.

[01:50:00.430 --> 01:50:07.550]
Yeah. Soldiers in Iraq know they're fighting and dying for a lie by Doug Thompson.

[01:50:07.790 --> 01:50:12.470]
Nearly three quarters of the American troops serving in Iraq think the Uesha would draw from the next within the next year.

[01:50:12.470 --> 01:50:15.430]
And 29% feel we should get the hell out of the world immediately.

[01:50:15.730 --> 01:50:17.690]
A pull-a-mone-tair personnel serving the country reveals.

[01:50:18.350 --> 01:50:20.010]
We had a little bit of that the other day.

[01:50:20.090 --> 01:50:20.550]
I think yesterday.

[01:50:21.010 --> 01:50:22.250]
But this is Doug Thompson's take.

[01:50:23.790 --> 01:50:30.210]
This jives with emails I've been getting from soldiers over the past several months and confirms that those serving on the ground and the war don't share the same rosy optimism.

[01:50:30.610 --> 01:50:33.070]
Paid it by the Bush people about the invasion and occupation of Iraq.

[01:50:33.870 --> 01:50:37.690]
Man, this gig has food bar written all over it says Marina served in Iraq for seven months.

[01:50:38.070 --> 01:50:40.510]
Morales into pits and nobody in our unit thinks we should be here.

[01:50:41.090 --> 01:50:46.050]
The poll conducted by Zogby International offers a rare look into the mindset of fighting men and women serving in a war zone.

[01:50:46.250 --> 01:50:52.530]
Then mindset is to say at least reflective of growing American unrest over war based on false information and outright lies.

[01:50:53.490 --> 01:50:58.690]
Among the findings by Zogby only 23% agree with the president's position that we should stay in Iraq as long as needed.

[01:50:59.230 --> 01:51:03.990]
85% of those survey felt they were fighting the word of retaliate for a sudden's role in the 9-11 attacks.

[01:51:03.990 --> 01:51:10.550]
Although the 9-11 commission found in 2004 that there was no credible evidence that Iraq had an any way cooperate without cut in the attacks.

[01:51:10.870 --> 01:51:14.890]
68% said they believed that the real reason for the war simply to remove Sodom who saved from power.

[01:51:15.410 --> 01:51:19.910]
40% said the Iraqi insurgency is mostly homegrown with very little foreign involvement.

[01:51:20.170 --> 01:51:21.950]
A direct counter-intention claims by the Bushes.

[01:51:22.310 --> 01:51:26.530]
55% finally opposed using torture and other harsh interrogation methods on prisoners.

[01:51:28.010 --> 01:51:41.030]
93% said that removing weapons of mass destruction is not a reason for US troops being there said Zogby president of Zogby International and instead that initial rationale went by the wayside and the minds of 68% of the troops the real mission became to remove Sodom who saved.

[01:51:42.330 --> 01:51:50.490]
In another direct contradiction of state-of-white house policy just 24% said that establishing a democracy that can be a model for the Arab world is the main or major reason for the war.

[01:51:51.090 --> 01:51:54.410]
Sodom being interviewed the 9-44 soldiers at various locations throughout Iraq.

[01:51:54.750 --> 01:51:58.030]
Three quarters of the troops that served multiple tours and had longer exposure to the conflict.

[01:51:58.390 --> 01:52:04.290]
26% were on their first tour of duty, 45% on their second tour, and 29% were in Iraq for a third time or more.

[01:52:05.130 --> 01:52:11.350]
The Pentagon did not cooperate with Zogby in the survey and described downplay the significance of the soldiers' responses but offered conflicting answers.

[01:52:11.890 --> 01:52:18.670]
In more release statement the military branch said the troop comments were not valid because troops in a combat zone are elected to express negative use of their situation.

[01:52:19.190 --> 01:52:24.110]
Then Pentagon spoke from Lieutenant Colonel Barry Venable tried to different spin. I wonder if he's keen to Floyd Venable Jr.

[01:52:25.130 --> 01:52:33.030]
The polls findings certainly are reflective of the attitudes we see displayed by the majority of troops who are performing a remarkable manner in a combat situation far from home.

[01:52:33.170 --> 01:52:42.490]
Venable said, I asked Venable's office for any polls the military conducted on troop attitudes in morale and they admitted they hadn't done any surveys but added that they based their conclusions on reports from commanders in the field.

[01:52:43.330 --> 01:52:51.730]
Emails received almost daily from soldiers in the field confirms Zogby's findings and say Pentagon claims of success in high morale as one national guardsman said, peer unmitigated volstment.

[01:52:52.350 --> 01:52:56.610]
Their emails in Zogby's findings show these men and women who put their lives on line day in and day out.

[01:52:56.710 --> 01:53:02.310]
Do so for a war they fully know was based on fault pretenses and that they're fighting and dying for a cause that doesn't exist.

[01:53:02.310 --> 01:53:03.910]
Plan and simple not complicated.

[01:53:04.910 --> 01:53:10.470]
Plan and simple like most American people who think that the Constitution allows them to have a pet.

[01:53:13.490 --> 01:53:20.250]
Even I even an old cynic like yours truly is hard press to believe that but it's right there. It's in black and white and purple baby.

[01:53:21.210 --> 01:53:23.390]
Is that nice? Sweet.

[01:53:23.810 --> 01:53:31.110]
First amendment lets you have a pet. Yeah and pet it heavily. Yeah, no he can't do that. Don't even stay that. Oh you're crazy.

[01:53:31.110 --> 01:53:31.830]
I'm just using. Sorry.

[01:53:32.390 --> 01:53:37.530]
We'll get joist. We'll get joist and parents. Let's say lightly and joked. We'll get joked man.

[01:53:40.990 --> 01:53:46.110]
Seriously. I read that email I got from him this morning. I wanted to sit here and put my head in my hands and just cry.

[01:53:46.930 --> 01:53:52.210]
Have you ever reached that point where you just finally say are you kidding me? I surrender. I give up. You talking to me? Yes.

[01:53:53.710 --> 01:54:00.430]
Like every day. Yeah. I surrender. You try your best to do the interview to do what they're paying you for and it's like.

[01:54:01.250 --> 01:54:04.950]
Oh, see how can you do it like that? And then oh guess what? What you can't do this either anymore.

[01:54:05.850 --> 01:54:09.790]
And we're going to have like some little punk who hasn't got a clue. We wouldn't know a radio from his ass.

[01:54:09.970 --> 01:54:12.170]
He's got to decide what you can say and what you can play on the air.

[01:54:13.350 --> 01:54:20.750]
Well, I got news for it. You know something you remember at the time way back when his whole thing with Janet Jackson and the movie gate started.

[01:54:21.470 --> 01:54:26.490]
And we got all these additional restrictions and so about maybe 40% of the stuff we used to play with can't play anymore.

[01:54:26.490 --> 01:54:32.670]
Maybe more like. I suggested that duck and clearance at that time.

[01:54:32.690 --> 01:54:38.490]
I've had some you know he was the PD or whatever it was that they go through the whole computer of the DCS and have to listen to everyone.

[01:54:38.770 --> 01:54:44.110]
If they're going to decide because I wanted on my ass see I don't like you said before. Have you seen anything in writing?

[01:54:44.110 --> 01:54:51.070]
Is there a corporate policy that spells out this new and improved and enlarged censorship plan that we got here for beastly broadcasting?

[01:54:51.090 --> 01:54:55.050]
I haven't seen it. I got one memo that I haven't had it. I haven't had it. It's saying what?

[01:54:55.050 --> 01:54:58.550]
I'll fax it to you. I got some chicken scratches on it.

[01:54:58.970 --> 01:55:00.810]
A memo that said when when did this come about?

[01:55:00.870 --> 01:55:05.650]
Way back when I'm I know you got the memo at the same time because we both know that that's old news.

[01:55:05.730 --> 01:55:07.990]
No, this is no see now it's above and beyond.

[01:55:08.670 --> 01:55:12.690]
Right. That email said this morning we're way over the top. We've gone way above and beyond.

[01:55:13.550 --> 01:55:18.530]
So I think we're entitled to know that as opposed to like you know playing in the dark with all the lights out.

[01:55:18.990 --> 01:55:22.330]
Now some people like playing around the darker lights out that all depends on who you're playing with.

[01:55:22.330 --> 01:55:26.790]
But that's another story. So I think it's incumbent upon them.

[01:55:27.050 --> 01:55:30.370]
Otherwise we may just have to go ahead and play music until we get this all straight now.

[01:55:31.210 --> 01:55:34.730]
There you go. I like that. It reminds me of once upon a time in America and that opium drink.

[01:55:35.210 --> 01:55:40.230]
And it is instrumental. So we'll be safe.

[01:55:40.650 --> 01:55:44.010]
There I say. That's right. There are no dirty lures in there. I never thought about that.

[01:55:45.070 --> 01:55:49.650]
Yeah. We can play like type line by the shantaze.

[01:55:50.230 --> 01:55:55.650]
We can play Billy Vaughn's sail along. So we'll read moon. We can play that like an endless loop.

[01:55:56.850 --> 01:56:03.290]
We can play raunchy. Bill Justice and raunchy. I think the title recludes the possibility of straight parts one or two.

[01:56:04.070 --> 01:56:08.250]
Even the title has to be. You see that he's playing raunchy crap out of radio. You see that, guys?

[01:56:08.250 --> 01:56:09.190]
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?

[01:56:12.030 --> 01:56:14.950]
Who should let me say it again. clearance the next time you start your car?

[01:56:15.950 --> 01:56:17.230]
I take a deep breath.

[01:56:18.870 --> 01:56:22.030]
Who should the Democratic Party presidential candidate be in 2008?

[01:56:22.790 --> 01:56:25.270]
113 votes. That's pretty impressive. he asked me.

[01:56:25.630 --> 01:56:27.750]
Oh, there's Bush and Wayienne Turtov, and Linda-Blain-Legenda Blime.

[01:56:28.450 --> 01:56:30.590]
And there's the brown sky. What does it all file for.

[01:56:31.570 --> 01:56:33.950]
Power Dean 236, you go, howie.

[01:56:35.050 --> 01:56:39.490]
There's a guy that doesn't pull any punches who tells it just like it is. He's not perfect. He's got his

[01:56:39.930 --> 01:56:41.650]
foibles, you know, that's what his wife said.

[01:56:42.810 --> 01:56:45.390]
His me his wife and she's one of them. She's one of the problems.

[01:56:45.970 --> 01:56:47.650]
Who wants to donkey is the first lady?

[01:56:48.670 --> 01:56:55.170]
It makes no difference to 13 Hillary Clinton 176. Al Gore 95. Barack Obama 85.

[01:56:55.870 --> 01:56:58.110]
I say him for VP. What do you say? Okay.

[01:56:58.150 --> 01:57:00.370]
Howard Dean with Barack Obama. There's a ticket that would kick somebody.

[01:57:00.370 --> 01:57:00.690]
Oh wait.

[01:57:00.690 --> 01:57:04.530]
Yes. Melly asked me. I mean, kicks him serious. Melly. That's right.

[01:57:05.810 --> 01:57:12.530]
Wesley Clark 69 who eats a hell of a Rubin sandwich. Maybe go to lunch with the Ellis Rubin after Ellis's latest problem.

[01:57:13.510 --> 01:57:16.010]
Rubin Rubin, I've been thinking your defense is really stinking.

[01:57:16.750 --> 01:57:25.770]
Joe Biden 58. John Edwards 49. I don't care 47. I hate this pull 38. Mark Warner, the former governor of the outgoing governor of Virginia 21 and John Kerry.

[01:57:27.430 --> 01:57:35.810]
That's bad, you know. John Kerry is to bring it up the rear in last place with only 19 votes out of 1110 votes.

[01:57:36.410 --> 01:57:38.890]
So that goes to Sherry and what low esteem he's held.

[01:57:40.430 --> 01:57:44.010]
I guess he's not so swift vote. Huh?

[01:57:44.870 --> 01:57:47.330]
Does that be only 14?

[01:57:48.190 --> 01:57:52.130]
Of course, I really feel that he would like to. Of course, his wife talk about liability.

[01:57:52.130 --> 01:57:57.690]
She would be. She really comported herself brilliantly during the campaign as well.

[01:57:58.630 --> 01:58:01.330]
Always just out of the line. I wonder how many. Remember in the movie?

[01:58:03.790 --> 01:58:04.830]
What the hell's the movie now?

[01:58:05.410 --> 01:58:07.770]
I don't know. A couple of few bars. No, with Sigourney Weaver.

[01:58:08.490 --> 01:58:10.450]
Oh, imagine they're here. Imagine you're here.

[01:58:11.090 --> 01:58:15.890]
Remember the fact that every time they open up the medicine chest or like all these every kind of pool that you can imagine.

[01:58:16.470 --> 01:58:19.690]
And that certainly is going to be what poor carries wife did.

[01:58:21.930 --> 01:58:27.890]
Yeah, I think she was doing 57 varieties of yesterday. She was doing it the hindway. Well, she could afford it.

[01:58:29.010 --> 01:58:33.370]
1215, a QA. We got Marlon's baseball cut off mighty soon, not soon enough.

[01:58:33.730 --> 01:58:39.990]
This is Neil Roger. Oh, my God. This is 516 QAF.

[01:58:43.090 --> 01:58:46.970]
Introducing the Q&M box office presented by Burger King.

[01:58:47.750 --> 01:58:50.010]
This is a tasty burger.

[01:58:50.550 --> 01:58:55.670]
Every Tuesday the QA and box office will open for your chance to win tickets to upcoming South Florida events.

[01:58:55.850 --> 01:58:59.950]
Thank God. The QA and box office on Sport Radio 560.

[01:58:59.970 --> 01:59:00.950]
It's awesome, baby.

[01:59:01.390 --> 01:59:02.030]
QAM.

[01:59:03.390 --> 01:59:05.010]
Now for 6.7.

[01:59:05.330 --> 01:59:09.630]
Don't buy the VG. Oh, my God.

[01:59:14.030 --> 01:59:15.590]
You're the best.

[01:59:16.550 --> 01:59:16.630]
Absolutely.

[01:59:17.870 --> 01:59:21.630]
Say I'm right, but then you always second guess me.

[01:59:25.450 --> 01:59:27.530]
Oh, what a let down.

[01:59:28.790 --> 01:59:33.670]
Call my hands before I even get my best down.

[01:59:36.530 --> 01:59:47.570]
And when I always on the main thing, you seem to get a bad headache.

[01:59:48.430 --> 01:59:56.710]
So when you do the press, me, so why am I in love with you?

[01:59:56.710 --> 01:59:57.510]
I'm in love with you.

[02:00:00.590 --> 02:00:02.490]
Oh, in a kitchen.

[02:00:04.090 --> 02:00:08.230]
You never thought we were still so with your bitches.

[02:00:10.070 --> 02:00:12.250]
You're just a chair.

[02:00:12.690 --> 02:00:21.250]
When there's trouble, I can count on you to leave me on the top of the wall.

[02:00:21.250 --> 02:00:28.690]
And when I see you, I fall in love.

[02:00:29.590 --> 02:00:37.410]
So why am I in love with God for you to press me?

[02:00:38.730 --> 02:00:42.250]
And why am I in love with you?

[02:00:43.350 --> 02:00:45.870]
In love with you.

[02:01:09.850 --> 02:01:15.230]
When I see you, I fall in love.

[02:01:15.870 --> 02:01:23.950]
So why am I in love with God for you to press me?

[02:01:25.230 --> 02:01:29.890]
So why am I in love with you?

[02:01:30.070 --> 02:01:32.490]
In love with you.

[02:01:33.870 --> 02:01:41.870]
You do the press, me, and I say I'm right, and then you always second guess me.

[02:01:41.870 --> 02:01:45.190]
And when I see you, I fall in love with you.

[02:01:45.790 --> 02:01:47.430]
Oh, I'll be even.

[02:01:49.010 --> 02:01:53.110]
I'll even give you back to your car and call it even.

[02:01:56.070 --> 02:02:04.650]
When I fall in love with you and I say I'm right, and then you always second guess me.

[02:02:05.650 --> 02:02:10.290]
From on the shelf, to when you do press me?

[02:02:11.070 --> 02:02:18.650]
So why am I in love with you?

[02:02:21.630 --> 02:02:24.310]
Yeah, that was an old break-off.

[02:02:25.010 --> 02:02:31.130]
Well, it was $1.25 and it was a build call to find that, like in a garage floor or something.

[02:02:31.790 --> 02:02:32.430]
What's that?

[02:02:32.650 --> 02:02:33.930]
Yeah, 45 RPM.

[02:02:35.950 --> 02:02:41.830]
And I have no idea who the group was or where the person was.

[02:02:41.970 --> 02:02:43.710]
That was really Nelson, but I know it's not.

[02:02:43.790 --> 02:02:44.650]
Oh, I didn't know where he was.

[02:02:45.510 --> 02:02:47.490]
He is a different mood ring.

[02:02:48.770 --> 02:02:50.870]
The garage orders you asked to let Cubans return.

[02:02:51.150 --> 02:02:53.570]
Oh my God, their feet were dry, baby.

[02:02:53.950 --> 02:02:55.370]
Were they wet or were they dry?

[02:02:55.630 --> 02:02:56.210]
How about their...

[02:02:56.210 --> 02:02:57.070]
Sorry, Joyce.

[02:02:57.550 --> 02:02:58.270]
Sorry, Lawrence.

[02:02:59.030 --> 02:03:00.290]
Can I just say one thing?

[02:03:00.470 --> 02:03:01.970]
I will say it anyway, whether I can or not.

[02:03:02.790 --> 02:03:05.690]
You see, it isn't the idea because we've always had somebody listening to these

[02:03:05.690 --> 02:03:07.010]
tweeting the vulca Brian bits.

[02:03:07.150 --> 02:03:10.830]
But in the past, it was always somebody that had at least we figured enough judgment

[02:03:10.830 --> 02:03:14.170]
and we could discuss or argue back and forth and listen to it together.

[02:03:14.410 --> 02:03:17.450]
Well, you know, your ride or whoever was right, you know what I'm saying?

[02:03:17.770 --> 02:03:19.330]
It was at least a little room for discussion.

[02:03:19.950 --> 02:03:22.370]
Now we have an overgrown child who's...

[02:03:22.370 --> 02:03:23.730]
That's the part where I have the problem.

[02:03:23.730 --> 02:03:26.570]
Not to fact, it's their licenses, assuming they had one which they don't.

[02:03:26.630 --> 02:03:27.290]
It's their license.

[02:03:27.490 --> 02:03:30.650]
So obviously they have a right to decide the content, what can be on the air, what can't,

[02:03:30.670 --> 02:03:32.850]
if they were just spelled it out which they won't because they don't know.

[02:03:33.490 --> 02:03:34.750]
But I understand that.

[02:03:34.910 --> 02:03:36.310]
They have no going to pick with them on that.

[02:03:36.490 --> 02:03:40.190]
But the fact of the matter is when you pick someone who is obviously way over the top

[02:03:40.190 --> 02:03:46.190]
and way underqualified to be making those judgments, that's why I have a real serious problem.

[02:03:46.570 --> 02:03:49.230]
Joe, but he don't care.

[02:03:49.450 --> 02:03:52.130]
So, you know, I'm screwed and I'm not happy at aversary, but up yours.

[02:03:52.130 --> 02:03:53.990]
You know, really nice.

[02:03:54.210 --> 02:03:55.350]
Oh, what's happening in Beverly Hills?

[02:03:55.370 --> 02:03:57.310]
Can it, can you tell me what is the latest package?

[02:03:57.310 --> 02:03:57.930]
It's a spacious package.

[02:03:58.230 --> 02:03:58.990]
Yeah, good morning, Kale.

[02:03:59.110 --> 02:04:00.550]
Even for all of a sudden, like that.

[02:04:01.090 --> 02:04:02.330]
It's a spacious package, only we have the product.

[02:04:02.330 --> 02:04:02.930]
Oh, yeah.

[02:04:02.930 --> 02:04:03.450]
It's on scene.

[02:04:04.190 --> 02:04:10.090]
And we hope to determine in the next 15 or 20 minutes or so to verify that it is not anything to worry about.

[02:04:10.350 --> 02:04:12.090]
But once again, just to be calm.

[02:04:12.090 --> 02:04:18.070]
Just like Michael Morrison, man, keep him on edge, keep him all panicky, keep him all in the state of, you know, that's the way to do it.

[02:04:18.510 --> 02:04:20.070]
It seems to be working very well, right?

[02:04:20.070 --> 02:04:21.050]
Oh, yeah.

[02:04:21.190 --> 02:04:21.530]
Like a truck.

[02:04:21.570 --> 02:04:25.790]
It's a box of Kleenex or something that somebody didn't toss in the dumpster.

[02:04:26.050 --> 02:04:28.250]
Oh, there's a suspicious looking package over here.

[02:04:29.510 --> 02:04:34.010]
A federal judge ruled that the US government acted unreasonably when it said home 15 Cubans.

[02:04:34.390 --> 02:04:34.830]
Incredible.

[02:04:35.230 --> 02:04:39.130]
Who thought that they had safely made it to the US when their boat reached an abandoned bridge in the Florida Keys.

[02:04:39.850 --> 02:04:46.490]
US District Judge, Federico Moreno, ordered federal officials this week to use their best efforts to help immigrants return to the US.

[02:04:47.030 --> 02:04:52.210]
And of course, when they go to Cuba and say, okay, will you 15 please raise your hand and there'd be like 45 million hands go up.

[02:04:52.590 --> 02:04:52.950]
Yeah.

[02:04:53.870 --> 02:04:55.990]
Everybody said, alienito and is the daddy.

[02:04:56.150 --> 02:04:56.650]
What was his name?

[02:04:57.770 --> 02:04:58.150]
Juan Miguel.

[02:04:58.490 --> 02:04:59.870]
Juan Miguel, how could I forget?

[02:05:00.150 --> 02:05:00.450]
Until.

[02:05:00.670 --> 02:05:01.150]
He's on me.

[02:05:02.430 --> 02:05:10.570]
Of the 15 migrants, Elizabeth Hernandez, 23 spoke with you so he had a press by telephone to the evening from her family's home in Matanza, Cuba, where she was celebrating the decision.

[02:05:11.390 --> 02:05:12.090]
I'm so happy.

[02:05:12.250 --> 02:05:14.150]
She said, I always hope I would be able to return.

[02:05:14.150 --> 02:05:16.250]
Well, how are they going to prove that these are the 15?

[02:05:16.990 --> 02:05:18.090]
I think they got pictures.

[02:05:18.450 --> 02:05:19.650]
The coast guard documented them.

[02:05:19.790 --> 02:05:19.990]
I don't know.

[02:05:20.710 --> 02:05:21.110]
I'm making stuff.

[02:05:21.330 --> 02:05:21.350]
Yeah.

[02:05:22.530 --> 02:05:25.590]
Well, the just sympathized with difficulty.

[02:05:25.690 --> 02:05:34.150]
The US Coast Guard faces in making his foot second decisions that see he wrote, those Cuban refugees who reached American soil in early January 2006 were removed to Cuba illegally.

[02:05:35.050 --> 02:05:37.830]
But the judge made clear that his ruling was limited in scope.

[02:05:38.630 --> 02:05:40.930]
I sure hope they use some scope before they let him come on.

[02:05:41.230 --> 02:05:42.790]
I don't know if that's the body wash.

[02:05:43.150 --> 02:05:45.810]
Some of that nice new list of green, even Josh uses that.

[02:05:45.990 --> 02:05:46.830]
That tangerine.

[02:05:46.990 --> 02:05:47.770]
Yeah, tangerine.

[02:05:47.990 --> 02:05:49.010]
I've got to pull it in for you.

[02:05:49.090 --> 02:05:51.730]
And by the way, don't forget to check out loose change parts one and two on our website.

[02:05:52.230 --> 02:05:56.650]
Maybe even more important than that is there's a new body wash.

[02:05:57.330 --> 02:05:57.690]
Zest.

[02:05:58.430 --> 02:05:59.150]
It's spring.

[02:05:59.610 --> 02:06:00.030]
What is it called?

[02:06:00.210 --> 02:06:01.410]
Spring, shower, spring something.

[02:06:01.570 --> 02:06:03.130]
It's green, but it's not like spring.

[02:06:03.130 --> 02:06:04.110]
That's not like flowers.

[02:06:04.290 --> 02:06:05.670]
Now, not like spring flowers.

[02:06:05.750 --> 02:06:06.730]
You won't smell like lilacs.

[02:06:07.390 --> 02:06:09.170]
It's a real manly smell, you know?

[02:06:09.290 --> 02:06:09.510]
Are.

[02:06:10.010 --> 02:06:10.910]
No, I'm serious.

[02:06:10.910 --> 02:06:12.630]
It smells like underarms.

[02:06:13.650 --> 02:06:14.830]
It smells like jock straps.

[02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:18.490]
I'll ask Norma.

[02:06:20.250 --> 02:06:22.150]
He's an old jock sniffer from way back.

[02:06:23.290 --> 02:06:26.550]
Sir, you know, Norma, you are as useless as breasts on my toe.

[02:06:28.350 --> 02:06:29.790]
In this holding, the court is not real.

[02:06:29.870 --> 02:06:31.670]
I guess what will be was on last night speaking of breasts.

[02:06:32.330 --> 02:06:33.450]
The hand that rocks the cradle.

[02:06:33.450 --> 02:06:36.290]
I still say that she looks just like Hillary only.

[02:06:36.430 --> 02:06:38.430]
You know, better looking obviously, but then again, so is my ass.

[02:06:38.570 --> 02:06:39.070]
Rebecca, the morning.

[02:06:39.690 --> 02:06:40.090]
Yeah.

[02:06:41.150 --> 02:06:42.810]
You always argue with me about that.

[02:06:43.110 --> 02:06:44.010]
Well, I'm not going to today.

[02:06:44.770 --> 02:06:44.930]
Why?

[02:06:45.730 --> 02:06:46.650]
I don't know, not the mood.

[02:06:47.770 --> 02:06:49.890]
No, it looks like Hillary's younger sister.

[02:06:50.370 --> 02:06:50.550]
Yeah.

[02:06:50.810 --> 02:06:52.230]
Now, she has a little bit of that Hillary.

[02:06:52.430 --> 02:06:54.550]
It's kind of that man-ish look that boots look to her.

[02:06:54.550 --> 02:06:55.430]
That's a sour color.

[02:06:55.510 --> 02:06:58.710]
Especially in the scene where she's like fighting up there in the attic with no-what was his name?

[02:06:59.010 --> 02:06:59.550]
The dark.

[02:06:59.850 --> 02:07:02.350]
And I still, you know, with all due respect.

[02:07:02.550 --> 02:07:03.230]
Few people in Hollywood.

[02:07:03.930 --> 02:07:06.250]
These, when are these stereotypes going to stop?

[02:07:06.410 --> 02:07:08.150]
The menacing, screaming, flaming queens.

[02:07:08.150 --> 02:07:08.550]
Right.

[02:07:08.830 --> 02:07:12.470]
And always the retardo blacks like the guy in the great santae.

[02:07:12.650 --> 02:07:13.330]
Neither was a tumor.

[02:07:13.490 --> 02:07:17.370]
To the tumor, remember, he used to slap the, with the donkey and the cart with the honey.

[02:07:17.770 --> 02:07:18.390]
It was the tumor.

[02:07:18.550 --> 02:07:21.550]
And then there's this retardo black guy in the hand that rocks the cradle.

[02:07:22.150 --> 02:07:23.510]
The one that he got was sniffing the tail.

[02:07:23.610 --> 02:07:25.050]
The braille and Julios with the thick accent.

[02:07:25.470 --> 02:07:25.750]
Yeah.

[02:07:26.050 --> 02:07:27.810]
All the ugly stereotypes all the time.

[02:07:27.870 --> 02:07:28.770]
That's Hollywood for you.

[02:07:28.870 --> 02:07:29.010]
Okay.

[02:07:29.150 --> 02:07:29.650]
That's America.

[02:07:30.930 --> 02:07:32.870]
Anyway, getting back to these Cubans.

[02:07:33.390 --> 02:07:37.070]
And this holding the court is not rolling on the wisdom or lack of wisdom of the wet foot drive with policy.

[02:07:37.070 --> 02:07:39.250]
And the way the women wrote under the government's controversial policy.

[02:07:39.390 --> 02:07:40.030]
Cubans in each U.S.

[02:07:40.130 --> 02:07:43.050]
Soil are generally allowed to stay while those stopped at sea are sent back.

[02:07:43.190 --> 02:07:45.410]
In this case, all sides agree the group was not stopped at sea.

[02:07:45.790 --> 02:07:50.070]
But the federal government said the old bridge didn't count his dry land because chumps of the bridge are missing.

[02:07:50.310 --> 02:07:51.870]
And no longer connects the U.S. Soil.

[02:07:52.070 --> 02:07:54.230]
Boy, you talk about nitpicking, man.

[02:07:54.390 --> 02:07:54.970]
And nose picking.

[02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:57.490]
If I was them Cubans, man, I'd be porked.

[02:07:58.010 --> 02:08:03.930]
They're like, we're very gratified by the decision said the grandstanding Kendall coffee and attorney for the migrants and their families.

[02:08:04.210 --> 02:08:05.030]
Good old Kendall coffee.

[02:08:06.010 --> 02:08:06.790]
So there you go.

[02:08:06.990 --> 02:08:08.610]
So let's hope that we get to write 15 back.

[02:08:08.610 --> 02:08:11.690]
Or if not, let's hope that they're all, you know, their first child is a masculine child.

[02:08:11.810 --> 02:08:12.510]
They all look really good.

[02:08:13.610 --> 02:08:14.870]
Or it's seven bills right now.

[02:08:15.410 --> 02:08:16.310]
Well, that's not too bad.

[02:08:17.170 --> 02:08:21.850]
We're not getting a thousand, but we got like a chance of being on the bordering it, you know, maybe 800, right?

[02:08:22.230 --> 02:08:22.330]
Right.

[02:08:23.190 --> 02:08:26.430]
Considering it's a short show and considering the general tone of the show today.

[02:08:26.550 --> 02:08:27.730]
It's not just not uplifting you.

[02:08:27.730 --> 02:08:28.630]
And plus the location.

[02:08:29.390 --> 02:08:29.830]
You know what they say?

[02:08:30.090 --> 02:08:31.830]
Location, location, location.

[02:08:33.570 --> 02:08:36.290]
Which kind of reminds me of safety, safety, safety.

[02:08:36.330 --> 02:08:37.090]
Same kind of thing.

[02:08:37.370 --> 02:08:37.450]
Right.

[02:08:38.210 --> 02:08:38.630]
Same deal.

[02:08:40.010 --> 02:08:43.090]
So anyway, the van is at in case you're around away the ballgame.

[02:08:43.270 --> 02:08:44.670]
You might want to come up with one of those.

[02:08:45.210 --> 02:08:47.890]
About 30 days or the about 30 t-shirts.

[02:08:48.010 --> 02:08:49.150]
That's got the same logo on it.

[02:08:49.670 --> 02:08:51.990]
You can wear it and people like Dick Daniel shoot at you.

[02:08:53.170 --> 02:08:54.410]
The van is at the circle.

[02:08:54.510 --> 02:08:57.130]
K.O.R.I.L. Boulevard and commercial just west of power line road.

[02:08:57.270 --> 02:08:58.990]
On a way to the ballpark there for the Oriola.

[02:09:00.330 --> 02:09:01.170]
Marlon's exhibitionist game.

[02:09:01.710 --> 02:09:03.250]
And it'll be there until 1250 this afternoon.

[02:09:03.590 --> 02:09:05.810]
And the good news is that it appears Norma isn't going to the ballgame.

[02:09:05.810 --> 02:09:07.250]
But it's got other issues to deal with.

[02:09:07.330 --> 02:09:08.670]
Maybe like clients and important stuff.

[02:09:08.890 --> 02:09:09.570]
But not that I care.

[02:09:10.570 --> 02:09:12.310]
Because it has nothing to do with me as usual.

[02:09:13.630 --> 02:09:14.810]
But then again, why would he want to do that?

[02:09:14.890 --> 02:09:17.650]
I got some good music picked out for the lead up to the ballgame.

[02:09:17.650 --> 02:09:18.710]
We haven't done this in a long time.

[02:09:19.850 --> 02:09:20.550]
Boys are back in town?

[02:09:21.470 --> 02:09:23.170]
No, not the boys are back in town.

[02:09:23.990 --> 02:09:25.250]
That's got lyrics to it.

[02:09:25.670 --> 02:09:26.150]
Oh, that's right.

[02:09:26.150 --> 02:09:28.750]
You have to find out this means play it, say.

[02:09:29.170 --> 02:09:30.070]
Yeah, instrumental.

[02:09:30.370 --> 02:09:31.810]
Oh, very nice.

[02:09:33.190 --> 02:09:34.310]
No, that's brilliant.

[02:09:35.830 --> 02:09:36.810]
Yeah, I like that.

[02:09:37.070 --> 02:09:38.110]
You got, that's a good idea.

[02:09:38.730 --> 02:09:39.850]
No raunchy by Bill Justice.

[02:09:40.050 --> 02:09:41.450]
But any other instrumental I think we'll do.

[02:09:43.150 --> 02:09:44.110]
Good idea or not.

[02:09:44.350 --> 02:09:44.870]
Excellent idea.

[02:09:45.350 --> 02:09:47.090]
Don't forget to stick around after the ballgame.

[02:09:47.150 --> 02:09:49.610]
Or check back with us later like Tom Belvedo would say it as you went.

[02:09:49.870 --> 02:09:51.470]
Because Matt Dog will be on after the ballgame.

[02:09:52.150 --> 02:09:54.010]
I don't know how many people listen to those exhibitionist games.

[02:09:54.010 --> 02:09:55.010]
But third man.

[02:09:55.310 --> 02:09:56.370]
And then we got the Panthers tonight.

[02:09:56.550 --> 02:09:58.910]
We'll find out tonight I think because the Canadians are red hot too.

[02:09:59.010 --> 02:10:01.670]
And they're like fighting tooth and nail for that playoff spot the last one.

[02:10:02.110 --> 02:10:05.350]
So we'll find out if the Panthers A2 in the Tampa was an avaration the other night.

[02:10:05.370 --> 02:10:06.990]
Or if they're like back with the vengeance.

[02:10:07.550 --> 02:10:08.410]
The Panthers are back.

[02:10:08.550 --> 02:10:08.830]
Who knows.

[02:10:08.970 --> 02:10:09.370]
We'll find out.

[02:10:09.690 --> 02:10:13.570]
Panthers and Canadians at seven o'clock after Panther preview and etiquette after the hockey game.

[02:10:13.770 --> 02:10:16.310]
That's our lineup and we don't have to worry about that two to four slot today.

[02:10:16.670 --> 02:10:17.530]
Because we got a ballgame.

[02:10:17.930 --> 02:10:18.390]
I got an idea.

[02:10:18.390 --> 02:10:21.350]
Let's just let's just replay Marlon's games between two and four every day.

[02:10:21.690 --> 02:10:22.050]
Okay.

[02:10:22.610 --> 02:10:24.450]
And we decide what we're going to do.

[02:10:24.630 --> 02:10:28.070]
You know, I have a feeling I could be wrong.

[02:10:28.070 --> 02:10:29.370]
I have a feeling there's something.

[02:10:29.910 --> 02:10:31.150]
I've always had that sense.

[02:10:31.430 --> 02:10:35.090]
You know, there's something going on that doesn't quite meet the eye here.

[02:10:35.150 --> 02:10:36.830]
You know, this whole deal now.

[02:10:36.870 --> 02:10:38.810]
Bye bye Greg and hello Joe.

[02:10:39.850 --> 02:10:42.670]
And there's something going on under the surface of all of this.

[02:10:42.810 --> 02:10:43.090]
Like what?

[02:10:43.630 --> 02:10:43.990]
I don't know.

[02:10:44.070 --> 02:10:46.890]
You're the one who's supposed to put your nose to the grindstone.

[02:10:47.550 --> 02:10:47.990]
Yeah.

[02:10:48.710 --> 02:10:49.630]
Just like the watermelons.

[02:10:49.630 --> 02:10:52.990]
You remember she was always under the instruction to go around walk up and down a hall and put her ear to the wall.

[02:10:53.530 --> 02:10:55.090]
And I'm just making that up either.

[02:10:55.250 --> 02:10:57.690]
That's that's the kind of environment we've been working for eight years now.

[02:10:58.870 --> 02:11:01.530]
We've got our spies in the hallway and if you say something, you know,

[02:11:01.690 --> 02:11:04.890]
like an incident that happened on Monday, which by the way,

[02:11:04.890 --> 02:11:05.890]
there was no response to that.

[02:11:05.910 --> 02:11:06.630]
My email this morning.

[02:11:06.630 --> 02:11:08.590]
I mentioned that too about that bogus phone call.

[02:11:08.590 --> 02:11:09.050]
I got Monday.

[02:11:09.170 --> 02:11:09.330]
I've been.

[02:11:10.490 --> 02:11:12.490]
See, Clarice is going to knuckle me under.

[02:11:12.650 --> 02:11:12.890]
Okay.

[02:11:12.970 --> 02:11:14.190]
He's got a knuckle the old man under.

[02:11:14.270 --> 02:11:15.570]
He's going to give control on me.

[02:11:15.770 --> 02:11:19.490]
And he's going to lecture me on how to behave and how to act other people in life.

[02:11:19.490 --> 02:11:20.690]
And what this word mean.

[02:11:20.930 --> 02:11:22.030]
Well, Clarice, see you next time.

[02:11:22.210 --> 02:11:22.330]
Okay.

[02:11:22.730 --> 02:11:23.370]
See you next time.

[02:11:23.390 --> 02:11:24.730]
You make your plane reservation a day late.

[02:11:25.310 --> 02:11:25.630]
Idiot.

[02:11:26.690 --> 02:11:28.830]
And by the way, my blackberry is always fully charged.

[02:11:30.110 --> 02:11:32.070]
And like I told you before to show you how you do that.

[02:11:32.490 --> 02:11:32.830]
Very simple.

[02:11:33.030 --> 02:11:33.030]

[02:11:33.490 --> 02:11:36.250]
Well generally when you travel, you carry your cord with you anyway.

[02:11:36.350 --> 02:11:36.430]
Sure.

[02:11:36.430 --> 02:11:38.970]
So you're good to have a long cord or sure that too.

[02:11:40.030 --> 02:11:42.270]
But before you go to bed every night, you just plug that baby in.

[02:11:42.390 --> 02:11:43.450]
That's all you plug it into charge.

[02:11:43.610 --> 02:11:44.470]
You turn it off.

[02:11:44.550 --> 02:11:45.810]
You let it sit there and charge fully.

[02:11:45.930 --> 02:11:48.270]
And in the morning, it's all set to go for a couple of days at least.

[02:11:49.550 --> 02:11:50.750]
Is that difficult?

[02:11:50.990 --> 02:11:51.730]
Is that rocket science?

[02:11:51.870 --> 02:11:52.890]
No, I got the same kind of deal going.

[02:11:53.250 --> 02:11:53.730]
There you go.

[02:11:54.690 --> 02:11:56.310]
Maybe you ought to give him some instruction.

[02:11:57.930 --> 02:11:59.270]
1232 at 560 WQAM.

[02:12:00.290 --> 02:12:01.430]
Beach Ford has gone nuts.

[02:12:02.110 --> 02:12:04.210]
It's madness in March all this month at Beach Ford.

[02:12:04.310 --> 02:12:05.530]
They've gone absolutely mad.

[02:12:05.850 --> 02:12:07.490]
They just missed having a record month last month.

[02:12:07.510 --> 02:12:09.110]
So they plan to break that record this month.

[02:12:09.490 --> 02:12:13.530]
Right now, our standard camp Ford 150s are as low as 249 bucks a month.

[02:12:13.770 --> 02:12:17.710]
You pay only 995 bucks down plus fees with the Proof Credit in 39 monthlies.

[02:12:17.710 --> 02:12:21.830]
Madness in March at Beach Ford means you must be mad if you don't take advantage of rebates

[02:12:21.830 --> 02:12:24.490]
and discounts up to 10 grand on all new and used vehicles.

[02:12:24.770 --> 02:12:27.970]
If you're not in the market for a new car, but know somebody who wants to send them to Beach Ford.

[02:12:28.270 --> 02:12:31.470]
If they take delivery and March Beach Ford will send you 200 bucks.

[02:12:31.770 --> 02:12:35.470]
That money comes from Beach Ford's advertising budget, so it will affect your friends price either.

[02:12:35.870 --> 02:12:37.850]
Whatever you do, no more set on this once a year event.

[02:12:38.230 --> 02:12:39.850]
Beach Ford's madness in March.

[02:12:39.930 --> 02:12:41.310]
It's going on right now as I speak.

[02:12:41.690 --> 02:12:44.530]
Extended camp Ford 150s is the lowest 249 bucks a month.

[02:12:44.530 --> 02:12:48.530]
This counts in rebates up to 10 grand and $200 for referring to friend.

[02:12:48.930 --> 02:12:53.230]
So hurry and Beach Ford is located just two miles east of the Golden Glades on 163rd Street in West A.C. Highway.

[02:12:53.550 --> 02:12:56.130]
Be sure and tell Paul that Neil sent you by Hill Afazassov.

[02:12:56.430 --> 02:12:58.710]
You'll love your Beach Ford experience in Squadron T.

[02:12:59.330 --> 02:13:01.230]
This is Neil Roger.

[02:13:02.310 --> 02:13:05.410]
This is 516 QAV.

[02:13:07.890 --> 02:13:08.690]
It's Dave!

[02:13:08.690 --> 02:13:09.250]
It's Neil Roger.

[02:13:10.770 --> 02:13:11.790]
Thanks a lot for the food.

[02:13:38.690 --> 02:13:41.190]
This is Paulo Houtta Faye.

[02:13:42.450 --> 02:13:45.730]
Everybody sending bad news.

[02:13:46.710 --> 02:13:48.450]
That's its US state.

[02:13:50.410 --> 02:13:56.030]
In the acts of patriotism, they're watching all of you.

[02:13:57.410 --> 02:14:00.450]
Everyone got the fascination.

[02:14:01.650 --> 02:14:03.650]
So what do you do?

[02:14:05.030 --> 02:14:07.910]
This counts in formation.

[02:14:09.130 --> 02:14:11.190]
And all you right left was.

[02:14:13.070 --> 02:14:15.550]
In poor Fatherland nation.

[02:14:17.070 --> 02:14:18.410]
Assess USA.

[02:14:20.550 --> 02:14:22.770]
You gotta hate those dudes.

[02:14:24.390 --> 02:14:26.230]
And Clinton's liberals too.

[02:14:27.950 --> 02:14:30.130]
Believe everything we say.

[02:14:31.530 --> 02:14:38.470]
And the state who undoes blood war for corporate.

[02:14:39.470 --> 02:14:41.730]
Be sure of your escondent.

[02:14:43.230 --> 02:14:45.670]
A roof and seignee who is venue.

[02:14:47.130 --> 02:14:48.570]
Fashess USA.

[02:14:50.870 --> 02:14:53.030]
We don't mind you see our jobs.

[02:14:53.310 --> 02:14:56.470]
So, a bad economy is good.

[02:14:56.470 --> 02:15:00.150]
We're fascinated by J.

[02:15:00.750 --> 02:15:03.250]
No, don't be no stupid.

[02:15:04.530 --> 02:15:09.090]
All the hours we see.

[02:15:09.710 --> 02:15:11.890]
The fascist arid get away.

[02:15:13.530 --> 02:15:16.770]
Everybody's earning bad news.

[02:15:17.570 --> 02:15:18.890]
Fashess USA.

[02:15:21.470 --> 02:15:22.810]
1239-21 go through.

[02:15:22.810 --> 02:15:23.670]
Almost done today.

[02:15:23.930 --> 02:15:24.330]
Yeah.

[02:15:28.910 --> 02:15:30.850]
1164 we got almost 1200 votes today.

[02:15:30.890 --> 02:15:31.950]
Not too bad on a short show.

[02:15:32.050 --> 02:15:33.130]
How are we doing at the event?

[02:15:33.490 --> 02:15:34.990]
I'm still waiting for an updated report.

[02:15:35.270 --> 02:15:35.790]
We have 700.

[02:15:37.550 --> 02:15:38.050]
We have 100.

[02:15:39.050 --> 02:15:49.810]
There you go.

[02:15:55.930 --> 02:15:58.470]
We have 100.

[02:15:58.470 --> 02:16:01.950]
We have 100.

[02:16:06.470 --> 02:16:07.650]
We have 100.

[02:16:09.150 --> 02:16:09.550]
We have 100.

[02:16:09.550 --> 02:16:10.110]
We have 100.

[02:16:10.610 --> 02:16:11.050]
We have 100.

[02:16:11.050 --> 02:16:11.250]
We have 100.

[02:16:13.210 --> 02:16:13.890]
We have 100.

[02:16:13.890 --> 02:16:19.690]
We have 100.

[02:16:19.690 --> 02:16:22.370]
I thought after yesterday I thought it was going to show what I am.

[02:16:24.170 --> 02:16:25.550]
Let me explain it to you.

[02:16:25.630 --> 02:16:26.690]
Let me put it out to you before we start.

[02:16:29.510 --> 02:16:32.590]
What it is, no matter who they name it, it's a general manager.

[02:16:34.050 --> 02:16:35.850]
It's a paper tiger thing.

[02:16:36.110 --> 02:16:39.610]
It's a nice rock, rock, rock, paper tiger.

[02:16:39.930 --> 02:16:41.430]
They decided they were experts.

[02:16:42.570 --> 02:16:44.130]
They're the ones who lost the license.

[02:16:44.830 --> 02:17:14.110]
They're the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who

[02:17:14.110 --> 02:17:44.050]
We have, you know how much support we have for management now? See before it was like, uh, you really didn't know because management was like absentee most of the time and so they'd leave us alone. Right now we do know the answer and the answer is zero. We have no support. We got like a friendly face. Hey, you guys are great. That poker brides. You know, but other than that, we got nothing. Secondly, sis Charles, according to a woman named Lynn Landies, who, whose website, ecotop.org points out to Republican owned companies,

[02:17:44.050 --> 02:17:51.610]
ES and S and everybody's friend, die both, control the electronic counting of 80% of all the votes in America. I believe I've ever had stories about that, but that's fine. Charles, a good reminder.

[02:17:52.470 --> 02:18:02.630]
Miss Landies did file a lawsuit way back in 2004 to put a stop to this, but oddly enough, the case is still dragging to the courts and will undoubtedly not be resolved until it's elected in November elections. So let's face it.

[02:18:03.210 --> 02:18:09.450]
Everything that the Democrats do until somebody puts a stop to this practice will not to nothing more than a vigorous exercise in mental master.

[02:18:10.030 --> 02:18:15.190]
Shones, you have an awkward to say the word because that's a bad. Got it. Mental.

[02:18:17.430 --> 02:18:24.650]
Station, which take it for me isn't nearly as much fun as it sounds as Charles. And last but not least, we've all seen the sci-fi where we were a foreign country,

[02:18:24.770 --> 02:18:31.270]
manages to replace the president of the United States with a surgically altered imposter whose sole mission is to systematically destroy America.

[02:18:31.270 --> 02:18:35.770]
Well, I'm starting to believe that this has actually happened. And if you think about it, it does explain an awful lot.

[02:18:37.610 --> 02:18:43.630]
Maybe he's one of the stepper guys. Stepper guys? Yeah, big of a lie. Yeah, right. The stepper guys.

[02:18:44.810 --> 02:18:56.290]
I mean, every time he makes a speech, you see an audience filled with the stepper wives and stepper guys, they all have that same blank look. In fact, anytime you see a bunch of fundamentalist Christians, they all have that same stepper look in area.

[02:18:56.730 --> 02:19:03.330]
They all have the hollow eyes, you know, the polypines in the eye. You could have stopped the fundamentalist.

[02:19:04.790 --> 02:19:09.310]
This is a bizarre story. I'm so glad we had time for this. And not that it's all that important, but it's just unusual.

[02:19:10.670 --> 02:19:14.630]
Dirty politics this ain't. Senator saves his opponent's life. Did you see this? Nope.

[02:19:15.570 --> 02:19:23.030]
Anapolis, Maryland state senator John Giannetti was waiting for his takeout order of Italian food at a Maryland restaurant on Monday when he saw man choking.

[02:19:24.270 --> 02:19:32.670]
He rushed over, performed the highlight maneuver and dislodged the chunk of seafood, saving the life of his political rival seafood. I wonder if it was a.

[02:19:32.670 --> 02:19:40.090]
See him could have been could have been one of them jumbo. See him. The choking man Jim Rosa P P.

[02:19:40.410 --> 02:19:52.230]
I don't think we can say this spell R O S A P E. Okay. His name is R O S A Rosa P E P P P P.

[02:19:52.230 --> 02:19:58.870]
Your choice Jim Rosa, whatever is challenging Giannetti in the Democratic primary for the suburban Washington district.

[02:19:58.930 --> 02:20:05.030]
You know that I have my jacket on already. I got my blackberry in my pocket, my cash and I'll also to go good.

[02:20:05.790 --> 02:20:09.790]
I'll be out of here so fast at 1250 like shot out of a cannon.

[02:20:11.450 --> 02:20:14.990]
It's one of those really weird cosmic things, you know, he told the Annapolis cap.

[02:20:14.990 --> 02:20:19.770]
He said Rosa P P E was hunched over and moving toward him in distress. So we've decided to try to perform the high look.

[02:20:20.870 --> 02:20:26.770]
Rosa P P P P. Thank his opponent for saving him. Obviously it's an incredible coincidence and a happy coincidence said Rosa P P P.

[02:20:26.870 --> 02:20:32.830]
A member of the University of Maryland systems Board of Regents. The race is still on, but Senate president Thomas V.

[02:20:32.990 --> 02:20:36.350]
Mike Miller said he hoped Monday night since it would soften the competition between the candidates.

[02:20:36.790 --> 02:20:44.370]
Maybe this means we'll see a more uplifting campaign as a result. He told the Washington Post. I mean, you would think it would be very hard pressed to say anything bad about a man who just saved your life.

[02:20:44.370 --> 02:20:46.510]
Why do we're gagging and choking on it? Good.

[02:20:47.110 --> 02:20:48.810]
Part of a cute story. Yes, I did.

[02:20:50.450 --> 02:20:53.230]
Who's going to save my life? Christ. Fend over.

[02:20:55.170 --> 02:20:59.590]
No, I heard you just do that. Yes, I did. Actually, he tells you to lay on your side.

[02:21:00.490 --> 02:21:04.430]
Oh, really? Well, not so fun. And kind of like a little nervous. He'll put your knees out.

[02:21:04.430 --> 02:21:07.570]
That tells you to lay on your side and curl up in a box. It's probably real nervous.

[02:21:07.570 --> 02:21:07.970]
Yeah.

[02:21:09.830 --> 02:21:15.390]
Robert County. Come in now. This is a story from a couple days ago, but yesterday we had that big euphoric anniversary of bash.

[02:21:15.930 --> 02:21:19.630]
And by the way, I heard it was a great show and especially thanks to those rejoins, I heard it was fabulous.

[02:21:20.910 --> 02:21:26.150]
Robert County commissioners yesterday approved the creation of a cell phone lot at the Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport.

[02:21:26.150 --> 02:21:33.130]
So the drivers can wait telephone calls from arriving passengers, which may not seem all that significant, but there are a lot of people who are pretty peered about getting tickets, you know.

[02:21:34.490 --> 02:21:43.290]
I asked you to approve this in the name of 16,542 Broward County residents who got citations last year while waiting on the access ramp to pick up their loved ones.

[02:21:43.590 --> 02:21:50.770]
Information here, I lean Lieberman. The region's other main airports, Miami International and Palm Beach International already offer cell phone parking lots.

[02:21:51.430 --> 02:21:58.810]
The cell, a lot of Fort Lauderdale's airport will be located beneath the existing airport and Prince Rampsoff for a room to road within a hundred yards of the terminal entrance according to county documents.

[02:21:58.810 --> 02:22:10.910]
The lot would handle about 50 cars, about 50. The decision in Broward before the commissioners was whether approved 282 grand for a new cell phone lot or whether to increase the existing 15 minute grace period at the existing parking facilities.

[02:22:11.310 --> 02:22:18.750]
Most commissioners said 15 minutes does provide enough realistic time to meet arriving passenger, including that extending the grace period role they cost more than establishing the cell phone lot.

[02:22:19.110 --> 02:22:26.910]
So we got our lot. We got a pillar assault. We got a lot in Broward County because after all it is a evil place.

[02:22:27.590 --> 02:22:33.430]
And I will say this, the airport last time when it came back from here was not overly crud. Just don't go on a holiday. So it might be in the schmite.

[02:22:34.190 --> 02:22:35.770]
Well, it's just not the time to travel, you know.

[02:22:53.550 --> 02:23:05.690]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[02:23:05.690 --> 02:23:13.290]
Howard Dean 248 makes no difference 231 Hillary Clinton 185 Al Gore 106 Al is not doing too bad
