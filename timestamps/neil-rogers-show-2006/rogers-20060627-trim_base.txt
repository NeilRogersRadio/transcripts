[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.900]
We'll queue AF 560 sports fan radio.

[00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.000]
We realized that there's only really about...

[00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:09.660]
Oh, three people.

[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.620]
You want to hear sports all day.

[00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:18.360]
Starting this Monday, we've got Gilbert and Lenny Marces from 6 to 10 AM.

[00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.700]
Only on 560 double little full AM.

[00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.400]
I want to act up!

[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.840]
Gilbert, you're at...

[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.420]
Our radio is the most beautiful concert of the summer.

[00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.740]
William Hong, Connie Chong, Hong and Chong together.

[00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:50.440]
We've got more than memories that we've got to show and through.

[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.940]
I've got bigger things to do.

[00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.220]
But more is back raining.

[00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.300]
That baby's house have built.

[00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.880]
Your fears will bleed.

[00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.080]
So obnoxious you have a stroke.

[00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.060]
Being for the memory.

[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.360]
William Hong, and Connie Chong, Hong Chong bullies us.

[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.120]
We're back! We're back!

[00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.540]
Oh, baby!

[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.360]
I'm too young to move!

[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.400]
We've got the bags for the first hundred people.

[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.080]
I'll ride.

[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.160]
One thing about Connie, man, she may not be good, but she's at least consistent.

[00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.520]
Everything she's involved in is a total flop.

[00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.120]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.520]
I did.

[00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.780]
She's flopping on it.

[00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:28.900]
They haven't tried to...

[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.240]
I asked you what's flopping on it.

[00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.520]
I'm top of the piano and she just silly big.

[00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.560]
At any rate, that's a good news, man, on the schedule horizon.

[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.240]
Look at that.

[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.980]
George is going to be on next Tuesday because it's the fourth of July.

[00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.160]
And a big paid talent like me to work on holidays.

[00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.940]
Didn't I make a netch?

[00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.240]
I asked before I went on vacation.

[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.100]
Yes, you did.

[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.640]
Fourth of July, that's George.

[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.360]
It's all you.

[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.540]
And then the sixth of July, which is a week from Thursday, we got up Marlon Gagey.

[00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.340]
Oh, no!

[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.180]
What if we get across 30?

[00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.060]
Well, when you live right.

[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.740]
So anyway, I was inspired to take this pool because of my experience in Berlin.

[00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.660]
Not the one I told you about, but the other one.

[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.360]
The soccer experience.

[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.660]
Wow.

[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.520]
Oh, God.

[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.280]
Yeah.

[00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.360]
And the worst part of it is now that the two friends that I took over there now,

[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.300]
that's all they talk about is soccer.

[00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.160]
And a soccer team.

[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.300]
And Ecuador and Ukraine.

[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.560]
And what a big football.

[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.680]
I can't fight.

[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.060]
And I actually did force myself to watch some of it.

[00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.300]
I mean, I didn't go to either of those games.

[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.860]
Wait, we pretended to care about the, you know, I say Ghana game and it was brutal.

[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.980]
Ghana, we are, man.

[00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.400]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.440]
It's just pathetic.

[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.880]
It is so ponderous and just goes and talk about diving.

[00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.920]
That's all they do is just dive.

[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.220]
Even in the Olympic swimmers, they never see so much diving.

[00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:38.020]
Diving.

[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.980]
Oh, gee, they're holding their, they're rising, they're holding their leg.

[00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.220]
And then all of a sudden, like the one guy that took him off the field in the stretcher,

[00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.100]
like 10 seconds later, he just comes running back on the field just far.

[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.620]
But anyway, that's the world for you.

[00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.180]
If you wonder whether so many problems in the world just look at that.

[00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.700]
Soccer.

[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.260]
Our poll today, or then, or don't we have yesterday's poll that you did?

[00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.740]
Let's do that one and see, I'm out of touch with this, I'm out of practice.

[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.280]
Yeah, I want to know what the result is for.

[00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.920]
Oh, 959 votes.

[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.460]
Pretty weak.

[00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.700]
You'd even get a thousand out of total.

[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.520]
What did you do?

[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.500]
A little around with a poll?

[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.620]
I started at 10.

[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.240]
No, that's not good.

[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.700]
In fact, I would have started my lot sooner, except that every time I keep,

[00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.440]
if I fax Eric the poll about three times, if I fax him about three, four times,

[00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.540]
then finally, he decides he's going to put on it.

[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.340]
He's busy, man.

[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.100]
When you know what the fact of the machine per se, he's going to be able to do the problem at the house.

[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.500]
I understand, he gets his faxes on the computer.

[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.200]
And by the way, Miguel, how about that MySpace.com forward slash Neil God thing?

[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.280]
What's nobody bothered to tell me about that?

[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.040]
You told me this morning.

[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.420]
A lot of news of QAM Fatboy is gone.

[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.540]
So I guess not a fatboy who called me this morning before the show.

[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.780]
Hi, I'm Tally.

[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.360]
There you go.

[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.020]
We'll keep playing that to keep his memory lingering on.

[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.680]
So I guess we take the padlock off the apprized closet where they have the candy bars in now.

[00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.240]
Right.

[00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.820]
Take that off the other food cabinet and all those other things.

[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.420]
He was thanking me profusely this morning for everything I did for him, which I have no idea what that is,

[00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.800]
since he never sold my show.

[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.760]
But anyway, here's your poll.

[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.720]
For the most part, how do you acquire new recorded music?

[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.880]
I should end up a category winner.

[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.900]
George sends it to me.

[00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.340]
I got 3600 songs on my iPod.

[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.580]
Well, that counts as a copy from a friend.

[00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.460]
I got my docking station man.

[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.440]
I got my dockers for old cockers.

[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.920]
I'm a Hemp and Cool almost as Hemp and Cool as Squares.

[00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.140]
Squares a cardboard box.

[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.040]
Anybe and Daddy.

[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.200]
Yeah, I really am.

[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.160]
For the most part, how do you acquire new recorded music?

[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.620]
I buy CDs.

[00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.180]
Oh God, 324.

[00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.240]
Well, I do that sometimes.

[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.120]
I buy some CDs.

[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.320]
In fact, I would have probably had to buy a lot more of them if weren't for you.

[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.180]
You send me all that good digitized stuff.

[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.320]

[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.860]
That to me, there are a lot of things that I marvel at.

[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.660]
Television and the fact that I'm sitting here talking and people can hear it.

[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:46.920]
There are things that are really amazing.

[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.200]
But when you actually download into your iPod,

[00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.020]
off that digital stuff, off your iTunes,

[00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.560]
and you watch it takes like a half a second for the whole song to go in there.

[00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.600]
And you watch those little...

[00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.720]
Like that.

[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.460]
I found an old box of tapes that I'd made.

[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.360]
Painstaking, real-time recording song after a song.

[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.560]
Yeah.

[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.500]
So that I could play it in the car and think,

[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.100]
and God, what insanity that was.

[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.520]
Yeah.

[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.260]
And here I was from at a technology we've got.

[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.060]
Man, it's really something that's far out.

[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.780]
I buy CD324.

[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.040]
I don't.

[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.360]
I don't acquire new recorded music 243.

[00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.280]
Well, what does that mean?

[00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:20.700]
I don't say it again.

[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.520]
Take your FM radio and Schmidt can.

[00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.060]
It flushes down the toilet, okay?

[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.380]
And all this crap about it.

[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.420]
Oh, they just have a thing on CNN where Sirius wants to buy out XM.

[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.740]
Uh-huh.

[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.860]
So they're thinking you have to golf on Vaughn and Sirius instead of XM.

[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.780]
I mean, forget about that.

[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.080]
When you can have all this music on your MP3 and your iPod and your phone and your...

[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.740]
You can even download...

[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.180]
So right into your...

[00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.320]
Correct.

[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.120]
So I'm hearing if you have a not long enough...

[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.300]
You!

[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.720]
Yeah.

[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.580]
That's what I heard.

[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.420]
That grade?

[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.740]
Have a wireless receiver in there just so I can do that.

[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.640]
Man, oh man, when you sit on the throne, can you imagine the music you could make?

[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.300]
Some port already do.

[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.620]
Anyway, download using file sharing sites and programs,

[00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.940]
live wireless, etc.

[00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.420]
Oh no, 192.

[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.400]
Don't be doing that now.

[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.840]
192.

[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.920]
What are you laughing about?

[00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.520]
Don't do that.

[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.660]
Don't do that.

[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:05.700]
I've never heard before.

[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.940]
Oh.

[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.880]
I just got it.

[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.240]
Download from a digital download site like iTunes, etc.

[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.700]
91.

[00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:14.780]
I hate this poll 57.

[00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.400]
Not too many.

[00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.100]
Friends give me copies 48.

[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.980]
Well, we must have a lot of lonely people out there because if you had any friends...

[00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:20.100]
Oh, yeah.

[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.820]
...they'd be giving you music.

[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:21.600]
What does that mean?

[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:22.540]
That was my copy.

[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:23.280]
That's right.

[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.420]
Yeah, there you go.

[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.360]
Friends give me copies only 48.

[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.900]
And I'm in the business so I get music for free only for.

[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.640]
And there's must have been inside the building from the other end of the building.

[00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.840]
Do we know any of the people, by the way, in Power 96 do we know who they are or what they're all about?

[00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.620]
I know some of them.

[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.980]
And some of them know us.

[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:38.500]
Yeah.

[00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.360]
Some of us actually know the brand new year.

[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:41.740]
We have 20 to tie our Lucy Lopez.

[00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:42.760]
Oh, and why are you away?

[00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.480]
I'm sure did Josh bring in on that miracle we had with Ricky Tiki-Kronin?

[00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:47.040]
Yes.

[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:48.200]
That was it.

[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.120]
That was my psychic powers at its utmost again.

[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.320]
And that had to be it.

[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.780]
Because all the lines were flexion.

[00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.460]
It was one of those, you know, I wasn't taking many calls.

[00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.120]
And I punched up line two.

[00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.200]
We had about 10 minutes to go.

[00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.020]
And it was Ricky Tiki.

[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.880]
He told me that it was him, but I was so anxious to get down.

[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.660]
That was the last day before my vacation.

[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.900]
And so Rick Shaw, who is 50 years in a radio business called in that day and told us he actually is going to walk.

[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.240]
He pledged to wash that cap once this year.

[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:12.260]
Dry clean, I hope.

[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.460]
No, he's just going to wash it in the sink problem.

[00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:15.400]
Well, it might shrink then.

[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:16.280]
Just wash it off.

[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.240]
And he can load it to rush.

[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.580]
Maybe it's got some prescriptions on it.

[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.260]
Oh, this poor rush man.

[00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.200]
I want to go stop picking up pill popping rush.

[00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:24.340]
Oh boy.

[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.460]
The pill popping?

[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:26.040]
Yeah.

[00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:27.280]
Rush limp ball.

[00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:28.680]
This is going to be his new name.

[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.060]
If he needs all this vigra, Rush limp ball.

[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.120]
There's a bit for poker right there for chicken.

[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.680]
And by the way, chicken, check, go out in the mail today.

[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.480]
He bugs me a little bit.

[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.020]
You know, I love him and he does some great stuff.

[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.780]
But he just, like I'll come on.

[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.740]
And then he sent me, he sent me an email.

[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:43.960]
He signed a fake banter.

[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.180]
And there's only, see your life.

[00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.340]
And you don't even know who that is.

[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.640]
He explained it to me.

[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:48.980]
Oh, didn't he?

[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:49.080]
Yeah.

[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.600]
I sent him an email and I signed it.

[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.520]
I should email the back.

[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.560]
It said, thanks very much, pay way in.

[00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:55.540]
It's signed it's pay way in.

[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.400]
Anyway, Rush lim ball was detained for more than three hours Monday at Palm Beach International

[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.420]
Airport after a three.

[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:05.060]
He said they found a bottle of vigra in his possession without a prescription.

[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:10.320]
Customs officials found a prescription bottle labeled as Vigra in his luggage that didn't

[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.600]
have lim ball's name on it.

[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:16.520]
But that of two doctors said Paul Millis, spokesman for the Palm Beach County Sheriff's

[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.540]
Office, two doctors.

[00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.260]
He's got a lot of doctors and a lot of pills and a lot of problems.

[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.180]
Wouldn't you think that if he was murdered there in Kagan?

[00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.500]
Because she was, you know, she's not bad.

[00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.380]
I mean, if you try to be objective about it, even though you hate her like poison, she's

[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:27.820]
not bad.

[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.540]
He probably shouldn't need any vigra.

[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:34.180]
But after taking all those oxies and having his hearing already, he needs, he's got issues.

[00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:34.920]
Uh-huh.

[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.060]
A doctor had prescribed the drug, but it was labeled as being issued to the physician,

[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:40.940]
rather than to a physician.

[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:41.940]
Oh, my God.

[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:42.320]
Oh, no, he.

[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:46.620]
Rather than Mr. Limball for privacy purposes where a black lim ball's attorney sent a

[00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.440]
witness to him, he's always got all these excuses, man.

[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:49.340]
Rush Limball.

[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.580]
U.S. Customs and Border Protection Examiner, the 55-year-old radio commentator's luggage,

[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.660]
after his private plane landed at the airport from the library, publica Dominicana said,

[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.020]
what's he doing in La Repula?

[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:04.360]
Dominicana then seemed like a rather strange place for a big right-wing jackass like Rush

[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:04.980]
or a lim ball.

[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:05.400]
Limball?

[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.200]
I guess he's copping some pills, is what he's doing.

[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:10.340]
La Repula Dominicana, maybe know some doctors down there.

[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.900]
The matter was referred to the sheriff's office whose investigators interviewed Limball.

[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:17.660]
According to Miller, Limball said that the vigour was for his use and that he obtained

[00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:18.500]
it from his doctors.

[00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:23.560]
Investigators confiscated the drugs which treats erectile dysfunction and Limball was released

[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:24.600]
without being charged.

[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.520]
The sheriff's office or his plans to file a report with the state attorney's office,

[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.640]
Miller said it could be a second-degree Mr. Meener violation.

[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:31.820]
How do you like that?

[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:36.540]
That's after his previous problems with Wilma and all the quote poppin and it's hearing

[00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:39.340]
going bad and all in the oxies he was doing everything else.

[00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.160]
He's a pill of in guy.

[00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.060]
It's okay for him.

[00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.260]
All the other drug use the out of the in Abu Ghrib or somewhere.

[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.940]
So, Nick, I'm curious as to the vetting process that-

[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:48.400]
Look at that.

[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.680]
Abu Ghrib released 450 prisoners.

[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.800]
Abu Ghrib, most of whom were like busy driving taxi cabs or whatever and they just

[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.180]
routed them up because they're evildoers.

[00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:56.640]
They're dangerous.

[00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.560]
They're evildoers in Liberty City, man.

[00:09:59.060 --> 00:09:59.200]
Oh yeah.

[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.200]
They're evildoers on that ship about their California at that port.

[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.880]
Anyway, here's today's pool in Spartan again by all that.

[00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:09.460]
And man, I'm going to tell you, if you could, you think that South Florida went crazy when

[00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:15.620]
the heat won a championship, it couldn't even come close to matching the hysteria when

[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.020]
Germany won their third match in the World Cup.

[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.340]
We're watching some of the footage.

[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:20.680]
Oh my god.

[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.080]
And just crazy people.

[00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:27.100]
All these soccer people are nuts and they're honking the horns and they're screaming and

[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.260]
they're going crazy although they do look very good.

[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.020]
Good on.

[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.440]
I'm telling you right now, you want to see some really hot people and maybe you'll even

[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.520]
get lucky and never know.

[00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.840]
That's where to find them in Germany.

[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.480]
I don't care what anybody tells you about Denmark or about Sweden.

[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.880]
I mean, you know, anywhere you go to get fans of nice looking people, some hot people

[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:44.620]
if you're hot to try.

[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.980]
But if you really have to try, go to Germany and you're proud all over the place.

[00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:49.860]
What's your take on a World Cup?

[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:51.320]
659 votes.

[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.180]
Oh, we're going to make a thousand a day during the show.

[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.340]
I don't want to embarrass you on this one day because let's see, I'll be on Thursday.

[00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:57.360]
Now, let's see.

[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.480]
Do we have a ball game this Thursday?

[00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:00.060]
I don't believe so.

[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:00.880]
Well, why not?

[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.540]
Because I don't want to have to overdo it here.

[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:07.980]
Although that is not ironic that the next Tuesday, the 4th of July in Georgia's

[00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.600]
volunteer, he said, I'm not going to let you work on 4th of July.

[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:11.060]
That's right.

[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.160]
I shouldn't have to do it.

[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.400]
Well, should I have to do it out of the American anymore?

[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.740]
You shouldn't have to celebrate that day.

[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.880]
So how about Canada Day?

[00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:17.600]
Can I get that off?

[00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:18.440]
It's this Saturday.

[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:19.720]
Can I get off on that day?

[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:20.420]
You know it.

[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:21.980]
Canada Day.

[00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.140]
Don't work on Saturday.

[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.120]
OK, and I will not work on the 4th of July.

[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.040]
But then the week from Thursday, I'll be on for like two and a half hours.

[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.780]
That is one heavy-do-these schedule, if you ask me.

[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:31.940]
A little bit more than I can handle.

[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.660]
660 FVotes, what's your take on a World Cup?

[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:35.460]
Oh, God.

[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:40.120]
Look at that abusive priest who the eyes on abuser with Paul at night and eight on CNN with

[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:40.540]
Paula.

[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:42.700]
660 FVotes on a World Cup.

[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.980]
Soccer is so boring.

[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:49.100]
You know, it's how I spelled it and underlined with 8.5 O's with one.

[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:49.920]
You f***ed up.

[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:50.980]
Oh, after you left.

[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:51.220]
After another.

[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:52.460]
232.

[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:53.900]
Moderately interested.

[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.260]
156.

[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:56.260]
186.

[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.780]
Moderately interested in the World Cup.

[00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.040]
Are you moderately interested?

[00:11:59.380 --> 00:11:59.640]
No.

[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.200]
I put so boring.

[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:01.580]
It is.

[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.500]
I don't want to hear about it.

[00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.260]
I want to smell it.

[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.620]
I want to know from it.

[00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.900]
Although it's that one kid from Paraguay that got injured.

[00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:08.860]
They got 80 different guys named.

[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.320]
We're in Aldo, Rolando, Rinaldo.

[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:10.860]
We're in Aldo.

[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:12.820]
Not the one from Brazil.

[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:13.940]
But I see.

[00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:14.760]
Yeah.

[00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.480]
No, they've been Aldo from Paraguay.

[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:17.500]

[00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:18.200]
Whatever.

[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:19.180]
He got injured.

[00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:21.240]
I'm going to nurse him back to health.

[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:22.240]
Moderately interested.

[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:22.940]
186.

[00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:23.560]
I love it.

[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:24.300]
Watch it on TV.

[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:25.060]
143.

[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:26.620]
Watching El Copo de El Mundo.

[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.040]
143.

[00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:29.180]
What's the World Cup?

[00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:29.620]
53.

[00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.480]
I bet you I know somebody who's wearing one.

[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:32.740]
Especially in that place.

[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.140]
As boring as watching any other sport.

[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.040]
That was Georgia's choice.

[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:36.960]
He added it 25.

[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.760]
And I hate this poll only 24.

[00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:39.320]
They like it.

[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:40.520]
They don't like soccer too much.

[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.320]
Well, actually, I'm surprised that let's see.

[00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:44.940]
21.4% of this various student audience.

[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:45.620]
They love it.

[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:46.580]
They're watching it on TV.

[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:47.320]
They're following it.

[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.780]
They got their flag from all these different countries.

[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.760]
Flowing, flying, Ghana, and Ecuador.

[00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:53.840]
I'm glad that you were all received.

[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:55.580]
You're knowledgeable guy around.

[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.440]
No, you knew about the Ecuadorians and the Mexicans.

[00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.020]
They're all the same.

[00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:59.060]
Injins, man.

[00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.000]
They just live in different parts of America.

[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:02.560]
But they're all injins.

[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.740]
People subjugated a lot of people all over the world.

[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.920]
Because the Ecuadorians stayed in our hotel last two days.

[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.700]
They went out there asking by Germany three nothing.

[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.300]
And I tell you, they are really grotesque.

[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.200]
I felt lovely in it.

[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:14.580]
The product.

[00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:15.440]
I felt like it looked pretty good.

[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:16.640]
That's why I got so lucky.

[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.560]
Anyway, 10, 13, 5, 60, what?

[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:20.600]
Elimination.

[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:21.280]
Yeah.

[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:22.300]
That must be it.

[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:24.400]
I got news for you, man.

[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.620]
When there's nobody else around for about 100 miles.

[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:27.180]
That's right.

[00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:28.420]
I'm pretty hot.

[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:29.480]
How do you think I got late in Montana?

[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.160]
Probably the same way.

[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.580]
Oh, I'm speaking of Montana.

[00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:33.820]
Guess what movie was on last night?

[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.180]
Two movies were on last night.

[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.620]
I started last part of a one.

[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.940]
And I saw the whole part of the other one.

[00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:39.660]
You'll never believe it.

[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.060]
A riverbed.

[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:40.800]
First one was it.

[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:41.280]
Pin.

[00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:42.000]
OK.

[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:42.220]

[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.940]
Pin, which I saw the last half of Oregon.

[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:44.980]
That's a damn good movie.

[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:45.660]
Highly underrated.

[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:46.060]
It's all right.

[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.440]
And the second one, which I watched the whole thing again.

[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.280]
Oh, he's a little jai-ca.

[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:50.720]
Oh, yeah.

[00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:51.460]
Fargo.

[00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:51.920]
That's right.

[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:52.720]
Yeah, something.

[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:53.920]
She is so great.

[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:54.300]
He's great.

[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.180]
He's not good.

[00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:56.320]
She is phenomenal.

[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.180]
I got to go.

[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.980]
I'm going to burn you a copy of Raising Arizona.

[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.300]
Frances McDormand is so good that she

[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.980]
doesn't have a huge part in the movie, but you'll love her.

[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.340]
She's just fabulous.

[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:05.360]
Yeah.

[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:06.460]
Oh, yeah, sure.

[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:06.680]
Yeah.

[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:07.320]
Oh, yeah.

[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.040]
Oh, yeah.

[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:10.740]
Oh, yeah, Norm.

[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:11.160]
Oh, yeah, Norm.

[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:12.840]
10-14.

[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.860]
If you're a cigar smoker and you like to take back

[00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:16.940]

[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.420]

These are the fine cigars I made with first grade tobacco

[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.740]
processed aged up to 10 years.

[00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:27.360]

[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.040]
in small batch hard to find tobacco.

[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.520]

in cigars got earthy hints of dark roast coffee,

[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.580]
chocolates, ficed and pepper flavors.

[00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:44.420]
It's almost like smoking breakfast, which

[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.200]
I'm sure a lot of you do.

[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:47.880]

[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:48.900]

[00:14:59.280 --> 00:14:59.640]
and pepper.

[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.940]
The finish is long and full body with additional spice

[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:02.940]
and a note of charge.

[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.240]

So why I am not a Nazi?

[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.740]
Pick your bad day and wait sniffing food.

[00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:40.280]
Eat the rust-druck and then bump.

[00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.580]
Owzing off the walls in a free half-room.

[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.440]
Eat the rust-druck and then bump.

[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:50.600]
Beatta, beatta, beatta, beatta...

Now eat the rust-druck and then bump.

[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.720]
Lost in anilyn-free gasось.

[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.020]
Eat the rust-druck and then bump.

[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.940]
Back from the turning force

[00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.380]
He do the rush, drug, and lymphop

[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:20.940]
He do the rush, drug, and lymphop

[00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:22.940]
He do the rush, drug, and lymphop

[00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:29.940]
Blue, blue, candy

[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.940]
I had a pretty much friends

[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.320]
And a pretty pretty

[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.380]
Pinched, gone

[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.660]
And we met

[00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.040]
Blue, blue, candy

[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.560]
Under the rush is where the stories go

[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.400]
We do the rush, drug, and lymphop

[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.700]
Amidst control to make a pigeon hole

[00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:59.440]
We do the rush, drug, and lymphop

[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.660]
And lymphop

[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:05.820]
He do the rush, drug, and lymphop

[00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:08.660]
And lymphop

He do the rush, drug, and lymphop

[00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:14.440]
Twenty past ten at five, six, ten to nobody to queue at

[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.660]
So let's take a look at that award winning schedule for today for 2-D June 27th

[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:19.820]
We got Kimba Bo-Camp-R-2

[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:22.040]
We don't have any of that, what's that all about?

[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.580]
Who was on last week always?

[00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:25.680]
What do you mean you don't know?

[00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.760]
I mean, it was Geltie

[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:28.380]
It was Geltie

[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:32.540]
Oh God, well maybe this is an honor of my coming back for a couple of days this week

[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.120]
We got Kim Bo-Camp-R-2

[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:38.900]
Mad Dog 4-6-30, I noticed very jackass had that big article in the Hearland Friday

[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.380]
Had that one little paragraph in there about Mad Dog's bumping up from 2

[00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:46.260]
But we don't know when and how and who and if and y'all day

[00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.280]
And that was after of course the 2-D 4-Slot's been a disaster

[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.840]
And we'd vacated it since we, what was the word he used?

[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:56.220]
Since they bumped out the mole and jettisoned the Mohawar David

[00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:00.040]
Yes, since they had 86th mole back in January

[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:03.760]
Mad Dog, before we got to Marlon's on deck, Manley or hotter than a firecracker

[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:04.900]
On the 4th of July

[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:09.700]
Marlon's on deck at 6-30, Marlon's on Tampa Bay devil raise at 7-05

[00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:12.620]
I'm sure there's a lot of interest in that game and any KF to the baseball game

[00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:14.720]
Marlon's won again last night, did they not?

[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:15.980]
Yes, they did 8-5

[00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:19.180]
8-5 is the final score and that is after that 9-game winning streak

[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.840]
And then they finally salvaged the game against the Yankees there

[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.460]
And that's the maybe a double-heter game

[00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:25.840]
Hold your breath, there are 7 games behind 500

[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.560]
There were only 7 games under 500 right now

[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.580]
What's upon a time they were like about 20 in fact I think

[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.540]
About 30 minutes to that and now there were only 7 under 500

[00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.820]
I'm smelling the World Series aren't you?

[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.200]
What?

[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:42.720]
If we had that, why not Super Bowl World Series Stanley Cup?

[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:43.680]
Yeah, you're right

[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:47.400]
Oh, I should mention the Panther's Trader Roberto L'Hongle, bad mistake

[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.840]
Bad and they bring in Todd Bertuzzi

[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:52.060]
If you can't play good, goon it up baby

[00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.760]
Bring in one of the most anxious people in the history of the sport

[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.240]
Bring in Todd Bertuzzi, oh my goodness

[00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.720]
Bad move there Iron Mike, bad move

[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:00.480]
But nevertheless

[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.280]
So you can do things like that in South Florida because nobody knows and nobody cares right?

[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.600]
Right, stuff like that

[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:07.660]
704 votes on a pull

[00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:10.120]
We're gonna make that fast today during the show, eat your heart out

[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:14.180]
So you got a big, see if you're smart, you'll email Eric the pull tonight

[00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.220]
In fact, email it to him about 15 times

[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:19.640]
I don't know what the pole is gonna be like five minutes before the show

[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:20.200]
Well why not?

[00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:22.600]
Because you know, I just can't think of something

[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.160]
I already got the one for Thursday

[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.680]
I'm not gonna tell you now what it is

[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.260]
But see, I work far ahead man

[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.500]
I work in a pool, I'd like to but I can

[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.620]
Well I do, I like to and I do

[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:35.280]
Anyway, now how would the calls been this last week?

[00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:37.620]
I'm sure that would have been the spectacularly ever

[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.380]
Anybody with a material, a lot of funny calls?

[00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.020]
Yeah, I knew that correctly

[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:45.320]
What do you think?

[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.520]
We had a good week, the week that you were off

[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.180]
Remember that Josh?

[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:49.980]
Oh, it was something special

[00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.300]
It was really remarkable

[00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:54.980]
And I was, it wasn't what you think it was even different than normal

[00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:57.620]
It was really unique

[00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:58.800]
It was a different than

[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:05.080]
Because anybody who's stuck in that 800 degrees in the shade right now getting ready for the next hurricane kind of a mosquito is bigger pulling balls

[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.120]
Environment, it's gotta be a crazy person

[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.820]
Even the weather in Berlin was very good

[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:09.900]
The bratwurst were outstanding

[00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.400]
The weather was great, the soccer was scintillating, I'm told

[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:13.720]
Of course I didn't see any of it

[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.640]
But I just don't understand

[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.560]
In fact, maybe I don't know if they're playing any games today or not

[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.480]
I don't know what the schedule is, excuse me for not knowing these things

[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.580]
Should I know that?

[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:23.080]
Yeah

[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:26.880]
I'm gonna go to one of my sports channels and see if they got any of this crap on their 4011

[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:30.400]
There's this update, there's a golf channel, I got that

[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:31.700]
How about the Wimbledon?

[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.460]
You want to put on some tennis from a Wimbledon?

[00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:34.520]
We'll be good maybe we can catch some

[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:37.060]
Oh yeah, I told you I was sleepy, I didn't get a lot of sleep last night

[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.180]
Well, there's the patch of the week

[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.560]
It's the greatest tournament on earth

[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:43.620]
And now you can get your 2016 World Cup highlights

[00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.140]
You'll set directly to your cellphone

[00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:46.900]
Oh, I can't wait for that, can you?

[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:47.760]
Your phone

[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.280]
I'm sorry, I already tuned down

[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.900]
Here's our first call on a great Tuesday, WQAM

[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.000]
Hey, I called you two guys, why you two are not on the line?

[00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.860]
Oh, man, we got them underwater this week

[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:00.860]
That's a good place for them

[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:02.280]
We're making some real progress, see that?

[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.840]
We have Mad Dog moving up to two o'clock one of these days

[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.860]
We don't know when, we don't know if and we don't know how

[00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:09.840]
But we got very jacked, I thought it was gonna be on after him

[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.200]
See if it was me, I'd have mine at two o'clock right now

[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.520]
I wouldn't care what happened after that

[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:16.820]
I have mine from two until he finally just said, okay, that's enough for today

[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.160]
You know, I mean, what should I do?

[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.360]
But then again, what do I know?

[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:23.740]
Don't start right off the bat making trouble again, especially with this heavy-duty sketch

[00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:26.400]
What you got? Well, that was our only call, it's kind of disappointing

[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.380]
Oh, no, there's another one

[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:32.540]
I thought to be pouring in and what's that myspace.com forward slash Neil God the thing

[00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:33.220]
That's right

[00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:35.620]
No, but I looked at it, it's pretty interesting

[00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:39.020]
We got 103 members so far, which I think is an audience

[00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:41.120]
And we just farted it, I mean, it's gonna work

[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.420]
Well, that's right, friends, I forgot we got too much more people listening

[00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:44.500]
But those are mostly enemies

[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:45.020]
Right

[00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:46.380]
But we do have 103 friends

[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:47.580]
No, that's nice to know

[00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:48.880]
WQAM, hello

[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.680]
Brazil got off, France and Spain

[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:52.320]
Yeah

[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.820]
And what about Ukraine?

[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:57.620]
The rain in Ukraine falls mainly closer to Spain

[00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:00.300]
There was a soccer call for it, isn't it good?

[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:00.940]
Okay

[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.140]
If it doesn't have to do with, they don't know for it

[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:06.080]
Okay, because that's the bad word, I can just tell me before the show that it was just

[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:11.440]
It was impossible to be in that building all during that final hysterical couple of days

[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:12.140]
It's impossible

[00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:13.780]
I can understand that

[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:17.260]
Because what in the world could possibly be more important than, huh?

[00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:17.940]
Nothing

[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:19.820]
And he's paying all our bills

[00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:22.960]
I didn't stay up to watch it, it was actually on paper review

[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.460]
The seventh game of the Stanley Cup

[00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:26.860]
Nothing could be finer than to lose to Carolina

[00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:29.520]
So I'll add a two o'clock in the morning Europe time

[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:32.040]
I stayed up to like 4.30, five o'clock, it was pretty disappointing

[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.840]
Pretty late in effort by the Oralers, eh?

[00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:35.160]
I'm sure you watched it

[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:35.280]
Huh?

[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.200]
Ha ha ha ha ha

[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:37.600]
Oh

[00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:42.000]
715 votes on the pool, what's your take on the World Cup?

[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:46.180]
Soccer is so boring with 45 o's in it

[00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:50.660]
253, moderately interested, 199, almost 200

[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:54.460]
This is shocking to me, I love it, I'm watching it on TV, 153

[00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:57.660]
If you add those second and third categories there, you got almost 50%

[00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:01.620]
How's that American team doing? They lost a gonorrhea, man, that's bad

[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.400]
What is the World Cup? 55, what is it?

[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.180]
I think Duff is wearing it

[00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:11.260]
World Cup is boring, is any watching any of this sport 29

[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:15.240]
And I hate this pool only 26, they love it, out of 715 votes

[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:18.760]
I think we might have that 1000 by 1 o'clock, and then I can go home, right?

[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.440]
Hey hurricane seasons here, don't wait until it's too late to protect your home

[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:25.700]
Hurricane Shutter Outlet has you do it yourself, Hurricane Panels

[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:29.200]
Why bother with those big home improvement warehouses when the hurricane shutters out

[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.420]
Letters your complete source for hurricane protection

[00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:34.540]
They've got everything you need to get to job done and save you lots of cash

[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:38.780]
They stock all sizes of clear polycarbonate hurricane panels and aluminum panels

[00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:43.360]
Or is that aluminum, aluminum panels that are cut to your needs and ready for pickup or delivery

[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.160]
All products are date-broward and Palm Beach County approved too

[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:49.400]
Contractors and installers are welcome and they accept all major credit cards

[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.500]
Date-broward and Palm Beach County approved

[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.880]
Step by step instructions included so why pay all that extra money for installation

[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:59.400]
When the hurricane shutters out, you can get you everything you need to do it yourself and save mighty big

[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:06.460]
Call us number 954-237-7083 or log onto hurricaneshutteroutlet.com

[00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:10.500]
Tell me that Nielsen should get 100 bucks off a minimum order of 350 square feet

[00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:17.400]
That's 954-237-7083 or on the Wicked Web, hurricaneshutteroutlet.com

[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:24.120]
This is Niel Rogers, this is 5.69 AF

[00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:36.660]
This is Dan Ruther for one of the final times reporting for CBS News

[00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:43.320]
You may have heard that I will be leaving the network for which I served as news anchor for 24 years

[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:48.300]
CBS has basically told me there is no future for me there

[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:55.220]
Well wipe the dog poo off my shoe and call me red butt, no future for me, no future for me

[00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:59.120]
This from a network that hired a party girl to be their news anchor

[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:02.080]
I say baloney to you, sirs, baloney

[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:09.380]
This Katie person drinks cheap champagne out of her stale doves while tabletop dancing and belting out karaoke

[00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:12.940]
Which I'm told is a Japanese influence singing style

[00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:17.900]
No future for me, I have been the face of that dump for more than three decades

[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:25.320]
Long before survivor, CSI or the Monday night comedy block which actually blows, I was the king

[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:31.320]
Yet they have the audacity, the unmitigated goal to tell me there is no future with them

[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:36.440]
No future for me, you make up a couple of stories about the president, suddenly you're a persona non grata

[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:40.040]
How about that long-haired freak we had in the radio division for all those years

[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:45.100]
They rewarded him by sending him to a company where the councils have their own radio show

[00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:49.960]
If you ask me, that's not too much vision for a company with an eyeball for a logo

[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:56.060]
Who could even believe that I, the great Dan Ruther, would become a body's useless as boobs on a bowl

[00:25:56.060 --> 00:26:02.980]
I guess the only way to ensure your future with this network is to cover oneself with body glitter and sleep with less movements

[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:08.140]
For the record I tried, less, was less than recipient

[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:12.100]
I have been forced to consider offers that quite frankly are beneath me

[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:20.220]
For example, a hosting job on the show, so you think you can dance and a new reality show called milking cows with celebrities

[00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:24.240]
This reporter has rubbed shoulders with the greatest newsmakers of our time

[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:31.780]
Gorbachev, Brezhnev, Heidi Plyce, and now I'm going on casting calls with screech from Saved by the Bell

[00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:34.440]
Uzol and Holmes in foreclosure vote

[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:41.220]
Well fire my skillet and rap me a bacon, I won't take it laying down unless of course less moonbears reconsidered

[00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:47.820]
Considered humiliated yet embarrassed certainly but not dead, not just yet

[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:55.220]
For now this is Dan Ruther signing off, I have a meeting with the people at sea Alice to become the new face of a reptile dysfunction

[00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:59.500]
This reporter is in as much shock as Will and Olsen reading his text bill

[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:03.900]
But I say this here and now, I will not go quietly into that good night

[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:09.480]
I will maintain what's left of my dignity even if I am forced to endorse adult divers

[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.780]
Dan Ruther reporting for Will No One

[00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:17.340]
At this time, 1034 or 206 before 11 at 560 WDQAM

[00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:22.040]
So we want to single out some of the bitch out there in the audience for a special persecution

[00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:27.900]
Okay, remember the day before my vacation josh and I woman called in and she said I hear that Bob Weaver is on his last legs

[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.140]
Remember that? Yes she did

[00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:31.740]
Yeah, and the next day guess what happened? What happened?

[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.740]
I'm sure you talked about that last week

[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.320]
Just yesterday I forgot to talk about it

[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:42.280]
What is wrong with you? It's probably the most other than of course that what could be more important than that?

[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:43.480]
Well you know I do a lot of drugs

[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:50.720]
And of course you crane winning a couple of games in a world cup other than those two things what could be more important than losing Weaver the Weatherman

[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:54.700]
One of the really great people in South Florida for a ziggin years, super guy

[00:27:55.240 --> 00:28:00.920]
So she's going to take responsibility because I heard through the grapevine, I made some calls, I heard that he was doing fairly well

[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:04.220]
And then all of a sudden right after she made that call the next day that was it

[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:07.340]
So I hope that he takes that to her grave and I hope it's not too long

[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:12.480]
740 votes on a poll, 740 CBL Toronto, hockey night in Canada

[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:17.440]
And they're like that, that ain't there no more but again what stations are there that used to be there not too many

[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:21.400]
The WCFL still WCFL and Chicago, I bet it is

[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.100]
I don't know, don't care either

[00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:27.880]
The voice of labor, you said the Chicago White Sox with Bob Ellison, you said Barney Pipp

[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:32.720]
But you know everything in this business is used to, used to was this, used to was that, used to be

[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:36.020]
And that's the whole business like this call online 6, used to be

[00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:36.320]
I know that!

[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:37.940]
Yeah I know that, I know it

[00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:38.580]
What call rush?

[00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:44.680]
Yeah call off for a show, he'll get some good supply, get some good doctors, keep you all fixed up all the time to hook you up

[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:49.800]
5-670560, pound 560 and they've arrived in Singular Wireless Line

[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:53.400]
At least 57 people were killed, see I love the headline on this story

[00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:57.620]
Bomings and kidnappings be siege you wreck after Maliki Peace Plan

[00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.400]
I guess you must have been working to with you

[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.300]
Oh geez

[00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:05.280]
At least 57 people were killed in attacks and 10 students were kidnapped from their hostel in Baghdad

[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:10.500]
A lot of hostel stuff going on over there, one day after the Prime Minister unveiled a Peace Plan, he ended easing the violence

[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:11.440]
Is it working?

[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:12.640]
No, is it out of the impact?

[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:12.880]
No

[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:18.900]
Moscow mean welcome from the killing of four vits Baghdad Embassy employees following an internet statement by their kidnappers

[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:21.360]
And Al-Qaeda led in search and grouping that they had been executed

[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:24.020]
And these are guys that even from Liberty City

[00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:32.780]
A sectarian violence reared its head again in Iraq where at least 25 people were killed in scores wounded in two severed bombings targeting the country's majority Shiite community

[00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:37.000]
The first attack here happened here by Kuba and the village of whatever it is, northeast of Baghdad

[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.340]
When a booby-trapped motorbike exploded in a marketplace killing at least 18 and wounding 20

[00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:44.980]
But Kuba's main hospital confirmed the tolls that most of the dead were children

[00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:51.360]
Shortly after a homemade bomb exploded in the main market of the city of Hilla, South of Baghdad killing at least seven air wounding 13

[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:54.800]
And it goes on, and on, all the dead people all the time

[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.280]
Things are going just swimmingly well

[00:29:56.280 --> 00:30:02.080]
And if the Democrats say that we should get our troops out of there while some of them are still alive and have all their body parts

[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:06.720]
That's cut and run, but if General Casey says, we're going to start with drawing some troops

[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.720]
That's a great plan for success

[00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:12.820]
And you do understand what they're saying now, and that is that the only thing that's acceptable

[00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.660]
Well, this is what Tony Snow said before we talked about Tarm maybe

[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:20.220]
He said, do you think that's acceptable as victory? Well, how do you define what is victory? What does that mean?

[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:22.040]
We'll tell you what it means when we see it

[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.060]
We'll tell you when we see it

[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:27.460]
All it explodes in fire at a quality and then bremen George, you're all, it must be a terrorist attack

[00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:29.040]
Maybe some of those Liberty City guys yet

[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:33.340]
That's what they're trying to get you all whipped up into a frenzy all nervous before those November elections you understand

[00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:35.440]
That's not the, they would never do that

[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.060]
That's not the Karl Roheveth in way

[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:39.820]
And of course this will prove what a good job they're doing and we should keep them all in awe

[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.300]
And that is correct, you see that? They nipped it in the bud

[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:46.400]
Just like here in Net Toronto they caught all those slime balls, they nipped it in the bud

[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:49.660]
All those guys with their 80 trillion tons of whatever that stuff was

[00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:51.960]
Actually it was like cardboard is what it was

[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:57.160]
A clear majority of Americans say Congress should pass a resolution that outlines a plan for withdrawing US troops from Iraq

[00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:01.000]
According to the latest pool taken over the weekend, the USA Today Gala

[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.380]
Half those surveys were like all US forces out of Iraq within 12 months

[00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:05.480]
I'd like them all home tomorrow

[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:06.860]
What's the point?

[00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:10.460]
I say stig while before you know they're having so much trouble with his trial

[00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:12.280]
Just stick son of back in there all over again

[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:15.440]
Even your buddy Bill O'Reilly said that he did a better job

[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.080]
Now what he said?

[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:17.600]
That's how I run that country

[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.300]
Just like Saddam Raiyan, Saddam Raiyan

[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:19.740]
There you go

[00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:24.160]
He said that in between a heavy, abbreviated phone call that Chris

[00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:29.680]
The pool finds support for the ideas behind democratic proposals that were soundly defeated in the Senate last week

[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:32.500]
And uptick an optimism toward the work of the killing of terrorists later

[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:37.600]
Abu Musal Alzar Kauai earlier this month seems to have evaporated right into thin air

[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:40.020]
Just like Osama disappeared into thin air

[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:41.860]
And while a little Omar in the thin air

[00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:44.260]
And I'm in the prime in Al Zawahi in the thin air

[00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:45.400]
Who keeps making...

[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.760]
Did you notice how fancy Shmanse is like this video was?

[00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:50.540]
You almost get the feeling he's making those in MTV or somewhere

[00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:52.600]
Man he's making some pretty fancy Shmanse of

[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.740]
And he had that nice picture of Alzar Kauai there

[00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:57.500]
Was lamenting and eulogizing?

[00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:58.880]
You see that one?

[00:31:59.220 --> 00:31:59.500]
Oh yeah

[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:00.280]
Wow

[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:03.420]
I would be surprised if they got both of them put up there in a French Riviera

[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:04.700]
I've been sitting there for a long time

[00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:06.760]
Because the bushes have been live after all

[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.060]
They're business partners

[00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:10.780]
They're like Michael Crowley, and Hyman Roth

[00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:12.080]
They're business partners

[00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:16.700]
Richard Eikenberg, a political scientist at Tufts University who studies presidential polling

[00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:21.180]
Says views on Iraq are too firm to be changed by momentary developments

[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:23.340]
They're set in concrete

[00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:26.860]
The other piece of quote on quote, quote news is the unity government in Iraq

[00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:29.680]
But it's not as if we're hearing that the man in the great strides in letting the

[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:32.320]
Illuminating the militia influence or violence anywhere in the country

[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:36.500]
There's still a steady drumbeat of bad news like that bad news I just had only a moment ago

[00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:38.820]
Bush's appropriating is the 37%

[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:41.040]
Last month I had risen to 38%

[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:43.880]
Now it's back on a way down to where it was in May 31%

[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:48.280]
His standing which slipped the low 40% in February has rebounded about that level since then

[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:50.960]
His approval percentage ought to be like about 2%

[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.220]
And all relatives

[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:55.220]
And by the way I do want the audience to understand this

[00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:58.040]
That war in Buffett gave away $37 billion

[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:00.960]
He didn't give George or George any of it

[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:01.160]
None

[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.260]
Or me either, I would have shared it with you

[00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:05.000]
I would have listened to something chicken that can't

[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.640]
But he didn't give us any of it instead of giving it to Bill Gates, your favorite

[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:11.560]
Of course he's going to give it to charity and he's going to save the world

[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:12.980]
It just, I don't know

[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.080]
I guess what's important to say something really wonderful about that

[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.480]
Oh great man, he gave away $37 billion

[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.600]
Can you imagine a good time we could have a woodbind with that?

[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:23.600]
$37 billion? Oh yeah

[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.380]
Oh, the plans I would have with that

[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.880]
Oh man, I'd be back in Berlin in about a half an hour

[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.180]
We had damn fast trip

[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:33.740]
756 votes on a post

[00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:35.240]
Creep a little bit here

[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:37.120]
I think it's the dog base if you ask me

[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.620]
It's a good time to be not working too much

[00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:40.720]
That's why this next week in a half man

[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.060]
Let's see, what's that schedule again?

[00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:44.840]
I do have to work Thursday, I'm not too pleased about that the whole four hours

[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:46.900]
But the next Tuesday is the fourth of July

[00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:48.480]
I got George all of four hours

[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.020]
Wait a minute, we got a ball game? No

[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:51.320]
On the fourth?

[00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:53.740]
What day of that day we had a ball game?

[00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:54.280]
The fourth?

[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:55.060]
What?

[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:55.960]
Yeah

[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:59.100]
Oh, you got a ball game on the fourth of July, 12-30

[00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:01.460]
So you locked out there, you didn't have to feel so bad

[00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:02.700]
I forced you to do it

[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:03.100]
Sorry

[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:06.800]
And then the following week from this Thursday we got another Marlon game

[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:09.960]
Oh, we love those Marlon's man, they're hotter smoked apples

[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.100]
Man, they're good, I'm gonna smoke apples

[00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:13.400]
Good, road apples

[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.760]
What's your take on the World Cup speaking of road apples?

[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:18.940]
756 votes, we ought to be up to about 800 by now

[00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:20.680]
I don't want us to fall short

[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.900]
758, soccer is so boring

[00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:25.800]
Oh my god, could put you into a coma

[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:28.440]
267, 35.2%

[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.340]
Moderately interested, 207

[00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:33.660]
I love it, I'm watching on the TV 163

[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:37.680]
So you put those two together, number two, number two, you got four, 49%

[00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:42.520]
Just about, aren't you shocked, almost half of the audience is either moderately or

[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:44.140]
Historically interested?

[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:45.840]
I don't believe it

[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:47.820]
What's the World Cup, 60?

[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:53.140]
It says boring is watching any other sport, 34, that's the George, because he says he's a sports board

[00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:54.300]
I think that's the World Cup

[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:54.560]
I think that's the World Cup

[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:57.640]
I think that's where they made that expression from, a sports board, that's here

[00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:58.620]
You're spirling it

[00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:00.520]
And I hate this poll, only 27

[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.860]
Out of our usually very, very difficult to please audience, they like it

[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:09.040]
1042 at 560 WNK, we got Kimba Bo Camp or two this afternoon, no, all of that, see that?

[00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:11.660]

This is Neal Roger, what's all it? This is 5.69 AF

[00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:35.740]
Doff, get off this incident

If you shift to way, then wait for 8 months, you'll stay in these things for you

[00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:20.700]
Don't be sexy in the world now, wait right then, can you get to Belgium?

Oh man, classic, market down, classic.

[00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:31.020]
Wow.

[00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:34.980]
1048 at 560 WQM, old chicken, that is added again.

[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:37.120]
12 minutes before the hour got Kim Bo Camp or two.

[00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:38.800]
Mad Dog at 4 but not for long.

[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:40.160]
He's moving up to 2 one of these days.

[00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:42.600]
That's a very jackass, it's right there in the herald.

[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:44.220]
There's a possibility it might be true.

[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:47.040]
Just like this might be a real call on 6th, but I sure doubt it.

[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.140]
Who's the QYM?

[00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:48.380]
Hello.

[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:55.760]
It was so good the first time it was definitely worth bringing back the game before.

[00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:56.420]
Right like breakfast.

[00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:57.320]
Wow.

[00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:00.520]
567, but it's been like this all week long, it's just a special.

[00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:01.800]
Oh, this is it.

[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:03.640]
This is all we got, huh?

[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:03.920]
Yeah.

[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:05.960]
Why can't play with anybody for not being there?

[00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:07.060]
I mean, you guys gotta be there.

[00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:08.060]
I don't gotta be there.

[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:09.380]
I don't wanna be there and I'm not there.

[00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:11.500]
And I'm pretty pleased about it.

[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:14.560]
But these people are there like, well, you know, good luck here.

[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:15.260]
It's all worth the say.

[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:19.200]
781 votes and good luck to you guys because you got like, let's see tomorrow.

[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:22.280]
And although Thursday I'll be back, like I'll be back.

[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:22.540]
Right.

[00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:24.340]
And then after that, not too much.

[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:29.780]
And then don't forget about that tail end of July in the first week in August.

[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:32.280]
I don't think I've seen you all that schedule for that, have I?

[00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:35.000]
I don't know, I think it's Josh turns the page.

[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.900]
We got July in my town.

[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:37.620]
Oh boy.

[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:38.900]
No, but what about August?

[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:39.700]
I don't know.

[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:43.260]
And not only that, but I just, it just dawned on me since my whole goal of life

[00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:44.860]
is to get paid for not working at all again.

[00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:46.300]
I do that so much the first time.

[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:50.220]
But starting in January, like next year I got seven weeks into the six.

[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:51.860]
Oh, I had no idea.

[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:52.520]
Yeah.

[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:57.800]
And I guess because the next year in my deal starts actually in January instead of October one.

[00:39:58.380 --> 00:39:58.640]
Okay.

[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:02.260]
I'll have to jam in like seven weeks between January and the end of the year.

[00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:03.280]
That's not gonna be easy.

[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:04.340]
I'm sure you can do it somehow.

[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:05.480]
I'll find a way.

[00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:06.400]
Whereas the world is a way.

[00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:06.940]
Oh look at that.

[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.380]
What's going on with that phone there, man?

[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:11.360]
Sorry, it's my, even the real calls are downed.

[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:12.660]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:15.500]
QYM.

[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:17.740]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:18.520]
I heard them that guy.

[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:20.040]
QYM.

[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:20.480]
New.

[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:21.160]
Yeah.

[00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:22.540]
George needs a show monitor.

[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:24.420]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:24.960]
Hello.

[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:25.260]

[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:25.300]
Hey, Leo.

[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:25.920]
Yeah.

[00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:26.720]
Hey, Leo.

[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:26.840]

[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:26.840]

[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:27.320]
You air down.

[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:29.760]
We're talking about, we're talking about, yeah.

[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:30.800]
No, we didn't hear anything about it.

[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:30.980]
Yeah.

[00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:33.040]
Uh, unbelievable.

[00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:34.200]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:35.760]
You know, yeah.

[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:41.200]
We need to bring back, uh, ever since going to the Coeur for the Panthers, they're going to

[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.060]
have to have a hand best.

[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:43.220]
Let's bring back kicks.

[00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:44.340]
Just the hell out, Goldie.

[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:45.260]
Yeah, okay.

[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:50.500]
Yeah, Geldie, I'm sure I'd love to do with the, uh, trading reversal of the Wango way.

[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:54.040]
You know, it's not Goldie for whatever you want, but there's another good sports fan for you

[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:54.920]
in South Florida, man.

[00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:56.220]
They really know their crap.

[00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:58.360]
In fact, that's the middle name, crap.

[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:01.560]
790, old man, 790, that's the ticket.

[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.260]
That's how many votes we got on the poll.

[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:08.220]
We better get off that number real fast if somebody's going to start having, uh, having like, uh, bad BMS all around the building.

[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:09.980]
0794, thank goodness.

[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:15.220]
Aren't you, uh, thrilled now that you actually got probably the coast will be clear a little bit more often when nature calls.

[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:18.260]
Now that fact boy's gone, that's how we don't miss him badly already.

[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:20.460]
No, no, because he used the handy crap anyway.

[00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:21.940]
He had to, you know, yeah.

[00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:23.800]
Well, that's not always used to.

[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:25.080]
The bar, you know, he ever used it.

[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:26.920]
I probably, we are, hang on loosely.

[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:27.460]
That's right.

[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:28.860]
WQA, I'm hello.

[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:31.460]
QAM.

[00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:33.200]
Yeah, Dr. Neil.

[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:33.920]
Speaking.

[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:35.120]
Hey, Neil.

[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:37.640]
What's the drug dealer?

[00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:38.980]
Always the drug dealer.

[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:39.740]
Yeah, okay.

[00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:40.060]
Great.

[00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:42.220]
56670, 560.

[00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:48.260]
See that, they get, if it's not encoder, it's not bush, it's not cheney, if it's not rush, you know, it's the same old.

[00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:50.960]
I think soccer is more simulating than this.

[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:51.820]
Yeah, but give us a good point.

[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:53.120]
The result thing gone are real.

[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:53.440]
What?

[00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:54.800]
Give us a good line at least.

[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:55.900]
That's something old and stay.

[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:57.740]
Yeah, old and stale, man.

[00:41:57.860 --> 00:41:58.980]
Like last year's MOTSA.

[00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:00.320]
Old and stale.

[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:03.940]
Like wonder bread from 10 years ago that kills bodies eight different ways.

[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:06.340]
Somebody QAM, hello.

[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:07.560]
Hey, Neil.

[00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:07.940]
How are you doing?

[00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:08.780]
All right, sir.

[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:11.220]
You're moping color brother, checking in right now.

[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:16.640]
A couple of minutes ago, you said that your own bushes numbers were like 37%, they should be at 31.

[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.620]
And they said they should be at 2%.

[00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:19.240]
Yeah.

[00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:21.160]
Well, you forget about the black community.

[00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:22.360]
His numbers have been at 2%.

[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:23.380]
But along with us.

[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:26.440]
We may not be with the program at all other things, but we were with the program.

[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:27.580]
They're under him.

[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:28.280]
Okay.

[00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:28.880]
We're under him.

[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:29.780]
Thanks, Pat.

[00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:30.100]
I know.

[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:31.660]
I mean, stay out of Liberty City.

[00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:32.200]
Okay.

[00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:33.040]
Yeah, you never know.

[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:34.300]
Don't be wearing one of them.

[00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:35.180]
Shmack is on your head.

[00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:36.660]
They're going to drag your ass away.

[00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:37.740]
Oh, you.

[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:38.300]
What?

[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:40.020]
You're just like Muslim, don't you?

[00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:42.520]
I'm just telling you right now that's where the terror is in Liberty City.

[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.740]
There's terror in the streets in Liberty City.

[00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:45.740]
Make no mistake about it.

[00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:47.960]
I don't want to get you nervous or anything like that.

[00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:48.500]
Cube.

[00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:50.600]
Oh, that is him, isn't it?

[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:50.960]
Cube.

[00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:51.860]
Oh, no.

[00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:52.180]
Yeah.

[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:54.900]
Oh, come on.

[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:55.960]
How do you think he takes those pills?

[00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:57.840]
Oh, geez.

[00:42:58.300 --> 00:42:59.500]
Next you'll be wanting to play.

[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:24.500]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:53.440]
In Correl

[00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:58.320]
now so I can send them a thousand stories for tomorrow. British health food

[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:01.880]
shops will soon be offering customers iced cannabis tea its Swiss distributor

[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:06.360]
said sold under the label C ice Swiss cannabis iced tea the beverage

[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:13.340]
contains 5% of hemp flour syrup and a tiny 0.0015% quantity of THC the

[00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:16.060]
active ingredient in marijuana I guess you got to drink a lot of that to get

[00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:18.960]
stoned. I am not. Any ingredient that can put in the drug

[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:22.180]
category has been removed and the team will not lead to dependency it says

[00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:25.440]
unless you drink it by the gallon unless you stick your own you in there

[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:28.640]
and then drink it through a straw for hours. But British anti drug

[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:32.180]
campaigners said that selling tea is dangerous because it will give young

[00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:36.200]
people the impression that cannabis is commonplace always if it's not it sure

[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:40.220]
as hell is here I'll tell you that. I got back just in time for a gay pride on

[00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:43.840]
Sunday making sure that we keep up all those ugly stereotypes and they are.

[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:50.040]
This product the iced tea marijuana iced tea was locked in Switzerland in 2003

[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:54.560]
and is already available in Austria Germany needle on Portugal and Spain

[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:59.140]
it's spongebob. How do you like that? It's really interesting to see your

[00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:02.880]
people man a old green toothed crowd how repressive I guess it's that

[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:07.120]
fatista thing and there's only two isms coming to look at fascism and you take a

[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:11.140]
look at Spain after all those years of fascism under Francisco Franco and now

[00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:13.480]
they've gone the other direction man like real I guess.

[00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:17.460]
Gomonesa or Fashista there's nothing between there and if you're not one

[00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:20.900]
you're the other and what about Liberty City though what about it.

[00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:24.760]
What about it. Watch your head gear in Liberty City that's my suggestion to all

[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:28.400]
our brothers and sisters in the in between man take the lot of your hair because

[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:32.340]
they're gonna drag your ass away and toward another terrorist attack.

[00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:37.280]
For war and then that's right before they put all the people from New York

[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:41.600]
times and the LA times in Washington Post in prison for a ton of like it is for

[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:45.080]
exposing all this fascism that's going on Washington speaking of fascistism.

[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:49.080]
808 votes on the pool we're gonna get that thousand and you'll see then they

[00:45:49.080 --> 00:46:00.180]
will hear us. This is Neorodger. This is 5.69. This is the Neorodger show.

[00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:05.940]
This is your brain. Who took this boy? Any questions?

[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:10.200]
That's it the x-rays of the duck are here. Thank you nurse let's have a look.

[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:16.640]
Wow what is that it's stomach. It looks like a face but what kind?

[00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:23.660]
I don't tell. It's shaped large eyes and it looks like it's one of the

[00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:30.100]
olds and twins. Yeah it looks like Mary Kate. No looks like Ashley.

[00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:38.740]
Mary Kate. Ashley. I think it's Amy on. Oh two and I noticed.

[00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:43.260]
It's 11 o'clock at 5.60 WQ. I'm already got one hour down who's counting right?

[00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:49.200]
Right me. 823 votes. You got a tough week next week. You got to work on the

[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:52.320]
fourth of July. Thank God for that Marlon baseball game next Tuesday.

[00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:55.740]
Thank Lord for that. See if it was me I'd had Mad Dog under to the

[00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:59.560]
second known. I'd stop poaching around. I would at least at least fix one thing

[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:03.460]
you know but I don't want to start with that again unless I feel like it.

[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:06.720]
You know what I mean? What do you mean? Two stoneways died in the shipping container

[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:10.180]
board a freighter bound for the port of Miami. Guess what was coming from okay?

[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:14.240]
Not a particular Dominican or you know the story. No I'm just guessing. How do you

[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:19.420]
guess that? I knew that you'd want to say that name because Russia was just there.

[00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:22.760]
Right. He brought back a bunch of Viagra or prescriptions anyway and I had the pills.

six hundred like that shot right there you see that you watch it is

[01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:37.580]

Asperi Jackass, because she knows.

[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:45.800]
Anyway, South Florida during the summertime means on days when it's under 100,

[01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:48.700]
you're going to be doing a lot of walking, at least from the house to the garage

[01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:49.880]
you get in the air-conditioned car.

[01:09:50.260 --> 01:09:51.560]

[01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:00.520]
Yeah!

[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:03.560]
Coulter is a fascist party dog.

[01:11:04.180 --> 01:11:06.380]
Coulter is a fascist party dog.

[01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:09.200]
Coulter is a fascist party dog.

[01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:12.000]
Whose user hey on you be you.

[01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:14.260]
Cheating ain't close to you.

[01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:20.240]
Well, we live in a free country that always grabs about being free.

[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:23.020]
Imagine how frustrating it can be.

[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:26.060]
I can't say a word that begins with C.

[01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:31.680]
Coulter ain't a woman, hands a man, put her in Adam's Apple and giant hands.

[01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:36.440]
Coulter ain't a woman, hands a man, but that still turns you on.

[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:39.460]
Come on, that's who turns you on.

[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:48.160]
Well, and is a good republicant who likes to flash her skinny gamp with no background all she can do.

[01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:51.160]
Is I on her back and say, kill the Jews.

[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:56.540]
Coulter is a right wing, partisan thing, kill a miniscirt and I long win.

[01:11:57.180 --> 01:12:01.560]
Nothing bad will ever happen in him, cause evil always wins.

[01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:03.180]
You think you're proud of evil?

[01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:04.580]
Always wins.

[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:07.900]
Well, when she's on TV you fools.

[01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:13.320]
Like we stare with the little drool and laugh along with the hateful swill.

[01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:16.300]
A partisan pungent side chokeville.

[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:18.880]
Coulter is a fascist party dog.

[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:21.740]
Coulter is a fascist party dog.

[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:24.600]
Coulter is a fascist party dog.

[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:29.880]
Whose views are hidden on you, you see the hateful spew.

[01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:36.080]
Few, few, few, few.

[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:38.440]
Well, there's Ronaldo from Brazil, man. He's good at gul.

[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:39.180]
Round Nalo.

[01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:41.380]
But I feel like the situation is not right.

[01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:43.340]
No, it wasn't El Roberto Baggio.

[01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:47.300]
Colorado Chancellor, Fire Professor, says.

[01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:50.460]
The University of Colorado is top official called on the school yesterday.

[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:54.700]
To fire ward Churchill, the professor would compare some world trade center victims to a Nazi

[01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:57.760]
and then landed in hot water over allegations of academic misconduct.

[01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:00.560]
Ward Churchill, he's like, crazy person.

[01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:03.540]
In a room chancellor, Philip DeStefano said,

[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:06.580]
Churchill's got 10 days to go to a faculty committee to appeal his recommendation.

[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:11.620]
Churchill, a tenured professor of ethnic studies, has denied allegations of plagiarism.

[01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:16.640]
I can't imagine that Colorado University is going to suddenly decide the first amendment deserves some respect,

[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:18.660]
Lane Zed, his attorney David Lane.

[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:23.000]
He said Churchill would sue if the fire rings up, he's going to sue everybody, soon everybody.

[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.780]
5670560, still let's see, they played 34 minutes and 15 seconds in the first half

[01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:32.080]
and it's still Brazil won and they got a rear team, Neil.

[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:35.740]
888 on the pool, and then a great number, 888, it's great.

[01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:36.280]
It is.

[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:38.140]
And all the soccer are facing out of this area.

[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:40.460]
They're watching right now. They ain't going to be listening to this stupid action.

[01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:43.160]
They're going to be showing what does this show have to do with the Copa del Mundo, man.

[01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:44.220]
Not a damn thing.

[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:45.220]
What, you're keeping them updated?

[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:47.400]
That's where I'm giving you instant update.

[01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:50.440]
They paid 34 minutes and 38 seconds, but there's still ain't nothing going on.

[01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:51.860]
Are these games on the radio anywhere?

[01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:54.760]
Well, I'm sure they are. I think that they're on XM.

[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:56.080]
Oh, I mean, I'm radio.

[01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:57.200]
Right after the golf, right after the golf.

[01:13:58.500 --> 01:13:59.140]
891 votes.

[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:02.200]
See, we're going to have that 900 by the, I'm telling you one thing, man.

[01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:04.620]
Ghana is putting it to him and I'm disguised down.

[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:05.700]
Oh, he's riding.

[01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:05.980]
And he's going to be using it.

[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:07.240]
He's using it.

[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:07.640]
Minsing.

[01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:09.180]
Winsing.

[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:11.840]
That was a very, very important challenge.

[01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:13.280]
Look at the determination here.

[01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:13.800]
A very, very good.

[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:15.740]
Number 18 to win possession back for Ghana.

[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:21.460]
And again, a shot goes 80 yards away the top of the net.

[01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:25.420]
And if I can notice that most of the shots in soccer, not that there are that many,

[01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:28.000]
but they go like at least 50, 60 yards away the top of the net.

[01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:29.940]
I think that they just made the goal a little bit bigger.

[01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:31.560]
891 votes.

[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:32.920]
What's your take on the World Cup?

[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:34.700]
Soccer is so...

[01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:36.060]
Well, here's a guy, now he's holding his knee.

[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:36.580]
I knew it.

[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:37.600]
Hey, Mr. Fondle.

[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:38.100]
Oh boy.

[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:40.540]
Oh boy.

[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:42.560]
Yeah, it's nothing bad with...

[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:43.720]
Oh, it's just a problem.

[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:47.080]
320 saves soccer is very boring.

[01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:47.940]
36%.

[01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:48.860]
And that's what I voted.

[01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:49.720]
And that's what you voted.

[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:51.600]
And that's what anybody with the brain would vote.

[01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:53.260]
Moderately interested.

[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:54.280]
242.

[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:55.680]
And that's because you're in South Florida, I guess.

[01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:56.520]
What else are you going to do?

[01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:57.960]
It's like that guy with a puppy, right?

[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:00.860]
Well, you know, sometimes you get bored, I guess.

[01:15:00.980 --> 01:15:00.980]

[01:15:00.980 --> 01:15:03.580]
And when you're in Stewart, you're going to do it.

[01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:04.420]
Not that bored.

[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:05.120]
Oh.

[01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:06.400]
I love it.

[01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:08.540]
Watching on TV, 188th, there would be no seat.

[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:11.780]
Those people are 21% way we can't get them folks

[01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:13.160]
because they're watching it right now.

[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:15.360]
There's Ronaldo again with his big round head.

[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:16.400]
Round out.

[01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:16.500]

[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:18.200]
What's the World Cup?

[01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:18.720]
59.

[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:20.500]
69, excuse me.

[01:15:20.700 --> 01:15:21.680]
It's changed into 59.

[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:22.600]
So we've not said Joyce.

[01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:24.000]
But there is that Ronaldo goal.

[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:24.680]
You want to see it again?

[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.040]
It really has to be played.

[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:26.040]

[01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:28.900]
As well as boring as watching any of this board, 43.

[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:30.700]
And I hate this pool, 29.

[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:31.860]
I'd say 891.

[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:35.140]
So shockingly, I think what's his name?

[01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:36.700]
It's right, the big rock solid.

[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:37.080]
Oh.

[01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:39.200]
Oh, we need a lot more soccer duck.

[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:41.020]
Let's get Andres Cantor on the station.

[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:43.560]
Here's how beats have in 26th or 26th or a Gildi on their number.

[01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:44.540]
Hey, guys, how about a survival?

[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:46.600]
Let me call you a cigarette again.

[01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:50.160]
That's just, well, we keep going back and making the same mistakes over and over again.

[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:51.980]
I think they're trying to sandbag the Humper.

[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:54.640]
Can you imagine how big of a sandbag it would take to sandbag him?

[01:15:55.140 --> 01:15:55.500]
No, how big?

[01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:56.140]
Big.

[01:15:56.540 --> 01:15:58.120]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:15:58.340 --> 01:16:00.280]
Let's go through a heavy duty phone call sweep here.

[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:00.720]
What do you say?

[01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:04.240]

We had an incredible week.

[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:06.780]
Unbelievable.

[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:08.460]
I'm sure Josh got in.

[01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:08.980]
Nope.

[01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:10.160]
How many QAAM?

[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:10.380]

[01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:14.960]
Hey, how about some beavers?

[01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:16.640]

You like them?

[01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:20.340]
How many QAAM, hello?

[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:21.820]

Hey, do you want?

[01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:23.060]
Okay.

[01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:28.440]
Listen, what was, uh, Rush Limbo doing with the agro over there in the Dominican Republic?

[01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:29.440]

[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:31.440]
I thought I thought.

[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:34.340]
I've got a couple of little boys over there, probably.

[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:35.260]
There you go.

[01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:36.460]
Hi, Paul.

[01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:38.140]
Yeah, what was he doing in the library?

[01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:38.900]

[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:42.620]
In fact, we ought to call up here in King of the Sea and right now and find out what's, what her take.

[01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:44.240]
What's your take, Darren?

[01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:45.480]
You bitch.

[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:51.700]
Man, I'd like to seal her and I in one of those seal containers, you know, just like those guys that died and then,

[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:52.660]
Tuberta, I'm back.

[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:55.500]
Oh, the other one was hard with Wolf Blitzkrieg.

[01:16:56.340 --> 01:16:58.740]
And also that Dana, Dana Bash.

[01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:02.620]
I'm going to tell you today is going to come to her, be blood spilled between her and Lou Doves.

[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:04.260]
He's, he's just going to like, uh, fasher.

[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:05.840]
Are you going to bash Dana?

[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:09.160]
I'm telling you, you mark my words, write it down on your wrist, and I'll see that.

[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:10.840]
I, I will watch that night.

[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:12.180]
Fast, fast, loose, Lou Doves.

[01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:13.780]
Just absolutely punches that bitch out.

[01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:15.680]
Watch him give Dana a bash.

[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:17.140]
Who are the QA and Hello?

[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:23.280]
You know, I'd rather have my temperature taken rightfully 27 times in a row than watch the soccer game.

[01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:23.920]
Yeah.

[01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:25.900]
Where have you been?

[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:27.440]
Uh, I've been around.

[01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:28.340]
Yeah.

[01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:29.300]
Been in Italy.

[01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:30.720]
You were in Italy?

[01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:31.140]
Where was?

[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:32.520]
Yeah, uh, Tuscany.

[01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:37.680]
Just, uh, Alpha Deanna, a little town called Colody Alpha.

[01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:41.140]
Near San Jimanano, that's more freeway.

[01:17:41.140 --> 01:17:43.820]
We're not planning any soccer there, although that's a tag-in team, man.

[01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:45.080]
They're still, uh, they're still alive.

[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:46.500]
They're going to win the whole thing.

[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:51.620]
I was like, Karakuri, you wanted to lie because it's fixed, and you see what happened when I was a tag-in, uh, yeah, everything.

[01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:53.700]
I understand, but yeah, the penalty check.

[01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:54.380]
I didn't see that.

[01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:55.500]
No, I'm not talking about that.

[01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:58.220]
I'm talking about the big scandal I had with the Italian teams over there.

[01:17:58.220 --> 01:17:58.760]
Didn't you see that?

[01:17:59.240 --> 01:17:59.540]
No.

[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:01.400]
You better get with it, man.

[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:02.640]
I didn't.

[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:04.680]
I just got a prayer that Brazil doesn't win.

[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:06.680]
Yeah, I'm getting tired of that, man.

[01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:07.680]
Let me tell you what.

[01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:11.240]
What I have to do with Embogue, I get more craft stolen.

[01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:12.480]
I'm more job.

[01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:18.180]
Okay, see you.

[01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:19.260]
That?

[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:23.580]
Wow, he sure haven't heard from him in a long time, and you've been pretty happy about it.

[01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:23.820]
Wow.

[01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:25.100]
He's good though today.

[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:26.100]
I mean, for him.

[01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:27.860]
I'm sorry, I was talking about Josh, I'm just a whole bunch.

[01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:30.720]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:33.860]
You are relentless, like I've always said.

[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:34.840]
You're such a hard-ass.

[01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:36.020]
Give him a chance.

[01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:36.740]
He was okay.

[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:39.300]
I mean, he wasn't no pro-Zac, right?

[01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:39.940]
I'm a run.

[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:40.740]
Who is?

[01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:42.340]
WQA and Rush.

[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:43.440]
WQA and?

[01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:44.820]
Never.

[01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:47.940]
No, that's the worst hitler.

[01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:49.660]
I want to be, we've ever had, I'm sure.

[01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:51.340]
By the way, every day, one of the nine.

[01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:51.860]
What?

[01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:53.420]
Gilbert, at least once a day, like I have it.

[01:18:53.420 --> 01:18:54.740]
Have you told me that's not Gilbert?

[01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:58.940]
No, that's not Gilbert, but Gilbert does call once a day to say Hitler.

[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:01.480]
Have you told me that the one that calls him, it isn't him though?

[01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:02.420]
It is, he said Josh.

[01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:03.440]
It is, it is.

[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:06.200]
But Gilbert does call him, but now he's doing it.

[01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:09.120]
Well, that's just special for you because he thinks you are your Hitler.

[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:11.040]
Well, the feelings mutual, Gilbert.

[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:11.600]
Yeah.

[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.760]
And of course, you know what the response ought to be.

[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:14.340]
It's a lie.

[01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:15.620]
I am not, but not for you.

[01:19:15.620 --> 01:19:16.160]
See, there you go.

[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:17.460]
In his case, I'll make an exception.

[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:18.140]
I am not.

[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:18.800]
Ricky Tickys case.

[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:20.100]
I would stuff Gilbert in another.

[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:24.680]
That was pretty, see, because I did, Josh tell you what happened there on Rick's 50th anniversary

[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:25.200]
on that Friday.

[01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:25.800]
No.

[01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:31.660]
Is the day before, in the afternoon, there came a fact for me in Josh's and it law from Joe

[01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:32.020]
Johnson.

[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:34.500]
Ever Joe Johnson from Magic One of the, yes I do.

[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:35.000]
Okay.

[01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:40.120]
So he informs me that the next day that Friday is going to be Rick's 50th anniversary on

[01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:42.240]
there would be really neat if I would call him up on Yada.

[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:44.080]
And so he gives me a wrong number.

[01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:45.660]
He gives me the inside line number.

[01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:48.500]
And of course, I never looked because he also gave me his own private number.

[01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:50.500]
And come to fight after we're both the same number.

[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:51.660]
They were both his.

[01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:54.040]
So 8.25 Friday morning.

[01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:56.800]
I'm all dushed out and I'm all sent to go for the show.

[01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:57.980]
And I go in there before that.

[01:19:58.320 --> 01:19:59.920]
And I pick up the phone, I dial that number.

[01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:05.000]
And then I realize it was the same as the other number with Joe Johnson's private line at the magic.

[01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:06.260]
So I came on the end.

[01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:07.900]
I ripped him an ass and I said several times.

[01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:10.800]
Yeah, I tried to call you Rick, but Joe Johnson's a jackass.

[01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:11.340]
He's an idiot.

[01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:12.960]
He's a you fair.

[01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:13.480]
That too.

[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:18.560]
And so then we had a magical moment there to, in fact, Jay and the American will come in this magic moment.

[01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:20.700]
It's in the, it was great that he got in.

[01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:23.040]
Do you want to eat long ass herald article about that?

[01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:23.960]
About what?

[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:25.400]
Rick Shaw's anniversary.

[01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:27.480]
I have, we haven't even went through all of that.

[01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:28.140]
We have the record.

[01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:29.820]
Somebody tried to fix it.

[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:31.100]
No, we don't want that.

[01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:31.840]
It's an email.

[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:32.240]

[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:32.780]
It's a week.

[01:20:32.980 --> 01:20:34.480]
Well, it's Friday for crying out loud.

[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:35.480]
It's almost two weeks now.

[01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:39.500]
Jesus Christ almighty and the president Lincoln still didn't like to play.

[01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:40.680]
What's wrong with you people?

[01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:41.800]
Like these people call,

[01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:43.120]
Oh, do you hear about Marshall and Bob?

[01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:45.580]
No, it's the first thing I talked about this morning, you morons.

[01:20:45.580 --> 01:20:47.020]
The show starts at 10 now.

[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:48.800]
We don't have to do the crossover anymore.

[01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:52.060]
We're leaving Hank on his own resting on his own laurels.

[01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:53.500]
And I hope that the laurels are pretty heavy.

[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.460]
There's a Jamie Merkins right there.

[01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:58.480]
Oh, look at that shot.

[01:20:58.600 --> 01:20:59.600]
Oh, don't tell me they just scored.

[01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:00.280]
Oh, pretty close.

[01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:01.460]
I'm telling him and it's gone.

[01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:01.900]
A team.

[01:21:03.020 --> 01:21:04.380]
There's an upstack in Smellett.

[01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:07.440]
I think Ghana win 42 and a half minutes.

[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:08.640]
They played it still Brazil.

[01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:11.660]
Uno and Neil for Ghana.

[01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:12.320]
Uno on Neil.

[01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:15.200]
I think it's kind of like.

[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:15.940]
Neil God.

[01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:16.460]
Neil God.

[01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:16.860]
Neil.

[01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:18.200]

[01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:36.000]
Rod Stewart passed away over the weekend.

[01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:40.440]
We have send out deepest condolences on this greatest of all losses.

[01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:41.720]
Yes.

[01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:42.880]
Donnie and Marie.

[01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:43.640]
Good to see you again.

[01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:46.500]
The station calls Wall New Jersey for the Osmonds.

[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:46.760]
Hello.

[01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:53.060]
Donnie and Marie, I heard a disturbing rumor that you two have been formicating together your entire adult life.

[01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:55.820]
We, um, it's okay. It's all right.

[01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:56.460]
We can be honest.

[01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:57.460]
You want to go there?

[01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:58.180]
I'll go there.

[01:22:58.320 --> 01:22:59.140]
Two or fours.

[01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:00.520]
Yeah.

[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:01.680]
It's true.

[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:04.020]
Three, five.

[01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:06.980]
Because it is intense and um.

[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:07.940]
But you're siblings.

[01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:09.000]
Is it a choice?

[01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:11.320]
You know, the wonder all you Osmonds look the same.

[01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:13.680]
The family tree only has one branch.

[01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:15.280]
I'm pointing the at it.

[01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:15.560]
Hello.

[01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:16.560]
Hi.

[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:17.100]
Hi.

[01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:20.920]
Marie, do you ever regret losing your virginity to your brother?

[01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:21.440]
Of course.

[01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:21.880]
No.

[01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:23.120]
I'd never take back that time.

[01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:24.180]
Oh, you love me.

[01:23:24.460 --> 01:23:24.840]
I have it.

[01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:26.360]
You're so bad.

[01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:27.180]
Jatin Texas.

[01:23:27.380 --> 01:23:27.600]
Hello.

[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:29.160]
All right. Listen, Donnie and Marie.

[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:32.660]
I don't know what kind of crap you're trying to pull here, but I don't believe for a second.

[01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:34.520]
You two have sex together.

[01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:36.420]
Um, I got to tell you, buddy.

[01:23:36.540 --> 01:23:37.320]
It's so true.

[01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:38.220]
Yeah, prove it.

[01:23:38.340 --> 01:23:40.040]
I want to see you kiss each other right now.

[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:43.200]
I'm talking right open now, flailing tongues here.

[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:43.780]
Absolutely.

[01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:44.380]
Absolutely.

[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:45.120]
You're a fly, right?

[01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:45.380]
Yeah.

[01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:46.000]
You're a fly.

[01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:47.680]
There's no pull this back.

[01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:48.040]
Whoo.

[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:49.480]
Hmm.

[01:23:51.460 --> 01:23:51.820]
Wow.

[01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:54.820]
It is the best.

[01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:56.440]
How are you going to win it out?

[01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:57.540]
The television history.

[01:23:57.880 --> 01:23:58.360]
Don't go away.

[01:23:58.500 --> 01:23:59.860]
We'll be right there, baby.

[01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:00.360]
Wow.

[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:03.380]
And of course, you know what Donnie's most popular song is in Stuart, don't you?

[01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:04.940]
Do I give a puppy love?

[01:24:05.220 --> 01:24:05.680]
That's it.

[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:06.440]
Oh, geez.

[01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:08.480]
928 votes.

[01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:09.660]
By the way, Brazil scored again.

[01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:10.960]
It was offside, but they didn't call it.

[01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:11.820]
So it still counts.

[01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:12.440]
It's 2Z.

[01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:13.060]
2Z.

[01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:14.940]
2Z for Brazil.

[01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:16.420]
Over the Ghana Rea team.

[01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:18.080]
Over a very hard working ender.

[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:20.340]
The only problem with Ghana is they're going to be close to the goal.

[01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:22.060]
I keep it about 30 yards over the top of the lip.

[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:22.380]
How many?

[01:24:22.460 --> 01:24:23.380]
About 30, man.

[01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:25.060]
And they called it puppy love in Stuart.

[01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:27.380]
And they called it go straight to jail and don't ever do it again.

[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:30.160]
Oh, I don't think the puppy loved it.

[01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:32.980]
Oh, my God.

[01:24:35.460 --> 01:24:37.740]
That's Donnie before either beat him.

[01:24:37.860 --> 01:24:38.600]
Yeah, he even came close to Bob.

[01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:39.820]
Wow.

[01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:41.600]
God is the city.

[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:42.300]
God is the street.

[01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:43.560]
Here we go with some of the big news.

[01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:45.160]
I know that we want to get real news intensive.

[01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:45.520]
No way.

[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:45.820]
No.

[01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:46.240]
You bet.

[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:52.700]
The rival Hamas and Fatas movements see today complete an agreement on a plan that implicitly recognizes Israel.

[01:24:52.940 --> 01:24:53.300]
Oi!

[01:24:53.900 --> 01:24:56.420]
Any weeks of acrimonious negotiations are tough, official said.

[01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:02.100]
We have an agreement over the documents that Abraham Abu Najah, coordination of the, it should say, coordinator, but it doesn't.

[01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:02.900]
This is a P.

[01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:03.300]
They suck.

[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:05.860]
Coordinator of the National Dialogue with the Proposal.

[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:11.000]
Salaf Zaidan, another negotiator, said preparations are made for a formal signing ceremony.

[01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:14.720]
All political groups are prepared for a mutual ceasefire with Israel, he said.

[01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:18.060]
President Mahmoud Abbas, a Fatasid, is fault-mire halosius.

[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:24.160]
Now, he said he's been trying to coax him to mass-ribe us into endorsing the document, which is formulated by senior Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.

[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:30.120]
Our position to the deal was voiced by Islamic Jihad, a small military group that's created out numerous attacks against Israel.

[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:33.120]
And today's meeting, we announced we reject some of the articles of this document.

[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:38.080]
We have reservations about other articles that call it al-Batch, spoken for Islamic Jihad.

[01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:43.260]
The plan calls for a Palestinian state alongside Israel and the fact that it goes on and on similar stuff.

[01:25:43.340 --> 01:25:45.140]
You know, the chair is already enough with that.

[01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:46.820]
Go kill each other and leave us alone.

[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:48.420]
And that's basically the way to look at it.

[01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:48.760]
I still do.

[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:51.620]
Pretty much from just, you know, well, you want to kill each other, have a good time.

[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:54.420]
It's just like the Indians and the Pakistanis and the same of the Israelis and the Palestinians.

[01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:55.600]
You want to kill each other?

[01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:56.980]
Hey, well, a more power to you.

[01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:57.780]
We'll pack you a sandwich.

[01:25:58.020 --> 01:25:58.160]
Right.

[01:25:58.160 --> 01:25:59.480]
Kosher for a face off.

[01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:00.760]
Kosher for a tissue boat.

[01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:03.440]
932 votes on the pool on the World Cup.

[01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:06.000]
And you better be respectful because they're at the halftime now.

[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:11.080]
And it's Brazil to head to the mill for Brazil over the Ghana real team.

[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:15.080]
Over a very tough and the dark and the surprising Ghana team.

[01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:16.680]
Ghana had been taken into a man.

[01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:19.540]
And like I said, they've been dominating the game and they're down to a mill.

[01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:20.460]
In that bag?

[01:26:21.060 --> 01:26:21.320]
To a mill?

[01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:22.580]
Quite a much of a thrill.

[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:24.480]
560-705-60.

[01:26:24.660 --> 01:26:27.060]
How come we're not getting any heat calls on here, huh?

[01:26:27.060 --> 01:26:29.580]
Oh, I think they exhausted themselves on Friday.

[01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:31.400]
That's why we're thinking of the parade.

[01:26:32.100 --> 01:26:33.540]
How many people ran for parade?

[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:34.760]
About third, man.

[01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:35.760]
You think?

[01:26:36.100 --> 01:26:36.400]
They're about.

[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:37.480]
I don't know.

[01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:38.540]
Do you guys go to the parade?

[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:40.240]
I'm sorry.

[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:42.940]
Didn't they interrupt the show for some live coverage?

[01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:45.800]
You know, we tried to and it didn't really happen.

[01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:49.840]
We had Miguel Colin with one update and didn't say anything and that's all that happened.

[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:51.180]
Really?

[01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:51.700]
Really?

[01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:56.140]
We were supposed to be getting all kinds of reports, but it didn't really start officially until two o'clock anyway.

[01:26:56.140 --> 01:26:58.020]
So, good timing.

[01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:00.100]
WQYM, heat headquarters.

[01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:00.440]
Hello.

[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:01.460]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:02.220]
Okay, sir.

[01:27:02.620 --> 01:27:03.200]
Too nothing.

[01:27:03.340 --> 01:27:05.120]
You ever going to deal with the overrun during this game, is?

[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:05.760]
Six.

[01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:07.840]
No, I wonder if I ever...

[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:08.620]
The overrun is probably one.

[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:10.680]
Probably Eddie Keele, tell you.

[01:27:11.180 --> 01:27:12.520]
This is the right station, though, for that.

[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:13.320]
He wants the over's numbers.

[01:27:13.540 --> 01:27:16.540]
I'm Tittley Winks, Maxi's on Knaasda Games in the Archando.

[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:19.640]
Whatever's going on, we got the over's numbers and the ins and the outs.

[01:27:20.940 --> 01:27:21.460]
WQYM, hello.

[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:24.720]
You know, you're sticky, it's cold and tiring.

[01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:27.760]
You're not going to get any voices all the time, too.

[01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:29.560]
Okay, your phoney voice is all the time.

[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:31.460]
You're really boring.

[01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:33.800]
Give it a kiss to Fatboy, too, by the way.

[01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:38.640]
5670560, Bob and 560, I believe, are rising and singular.

[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:40.000]
That must have been Gildey's boyfriend.

[01:27:40.260 --> 01:27:41.600]
Why did I have a point where stick is old?

[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:43.660]
My stick is real old, but it still works.

[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:44.740]
WQYM, hello.

[01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:47.480]
Working, well, English, fine.

[01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:48.060]
QAN.

[01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:50.540]
QAN.

[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:51.860]
Oh, boy, we lost.

[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.000]
That was going to be a really good call.

[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.620]
I was Fatboy's other friend.

[01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:56.780]
WQYM, hello.

[01:27:58.020 --> 01:27:58.400]
Gildey.

[01:27:58.540 --> 01:27:59.040]
Yes, sir.

[01:27:59.340 --> 01:27:59.960]
How are you today?

[01:28:00.380 --> 01:28:00.820]
Okay, sir.

[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:01.460]
How are you today?

[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:02.880]
Pretty good, thank you.

[01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:08.340]
I don't know if you saw it, you probably did, but there was a good article in the Sentinel this morning by the end.

[01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:09.160]
It's about coming out.

[01:28:09.940 --> 01:28:11.000]
By Marine Dowd?

[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:11.820]
Yes, sir.

[01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:13.600]
Worth reading over the air.

[01:28:13.820 --> 01:28:15.620]
It was one of her bests.

[01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:16.960]
Well, how down did I miss that?

[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:17.980]
I don't know.

[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:19.600]
Well, I'll check it out right now.

[01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:20.080]
Thanks, pal.

[01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:22.400]
How would I ever miss a Marine Dowd column?

[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:26.100]
Because it wasn't in the York Times, unless it's an oldie with baddie, huh?

[01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:27.200]
Out of it.

[01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:28.480]
You know what the problem is going to be now?

[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:29.080]
What?

[01:28:29.460 --> 01:28:32.700]
Well, no, because it's the Sentinel website, and you know the issue is that I have this website.

[01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:33.160]
Oh, yeah.

[01:28:33.740 --> 01:28:37.520]
So rather than wasting my time with this, in fact, you know what I'm going to do?

[01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:38.560]
I give up what he can do.

[01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:40.020]
He's just going to Google Marine Dowd.

[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:40.820]
Good playing.

[01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:45.700]
Well, no, because their columns are usually in the Times, and that's where I usually get them from.

[01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:47.340]
And I can meet with you, go right on our...

[01:28:47.340 --> 01:28:50.760]
Let's see, recent columns and multi-media by Marine Dowd.

[01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:51.160]
Here we go.

[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:52.420]
I'm clicking on it.

[01:28:52.980 --> 01:28:54.940]
I'm live, so I should have had some filler music all cute up.

[01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:56.220]
We need Chloe.

[01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:56.840]
Is that...

[01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:58.260]
I don't know which one he's talking about.

[01:28:58.660 --> 01:28:58.940]
Readable.

[01:28:59.460 --> 01:29:01.380]
Well, that must be the one he's talking about.

[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:04.300]
How am I going to know if it's the one he's talking about?

[01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:04.640]
Readable.

[01:29:05.020 --> 01:29:07.260]
Well, no, go to the Sun Sentinel, because you can do it, see?

[01:29:07.780 --> 01:29:11.240]
Because they reprint her columns like days later, you know, a couple of days.

[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:13.560]
See which one it is before I waste my time reading this.

[01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:14.340]
Although I will...

[01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:16.120]
Did he give us a hint?

[01:29:16.580 --> 01:29:16.940]
Huh?

[01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:19.120]
No, he just said it's in the Sun Sentinel day.

[01:29:19.340 --> 01:29:21.180]
Just look at Marine Dowd's column, doing it.

[01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:22.120]
Can't you do that?

[01:29:22.300 --> 01:29:25.100]
I mean, is this a little bit too big of a tall of an order for you to handle?

[01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:26.720]
Well, you know how I am about tall.

[01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:27.440]
Yeah.

[01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:29.660]
Well, that was way offside.

[01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:30.660]
Even I know that.

[01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:31.180]
Look at that.

[01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:33.160]
This game is fixed.

[01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:35.180]
And the tunnel he's at boring, but it's fixed.

[01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:38.100]
Okay, we got Marine Dowd's column from June 24th.

[01:29:38.180 --> 01:29:38.840]
We need Chloe.

[01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:42.060]
But I'm not going to read it if it's not the same one that this guy's talking about.

[01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:44.680]
I got our men necessary.

[01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:45.680]
Really?

[01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:48.940]
In the Sun Sentinel, well, maybe you can print that one out.

[01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:49.640]
Wait a minute.

[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:51.140]
Let me go back a minute and see what for that.

[01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:52.420]
I don't think that column was in there.

[01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:54.740]
As we need Chloe again.

[01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:55.280]
Poor Marine.

[01:29:55.580 --> 01:29:57.420]
She's so good and print and so bad on here.

[01:29:58.400 --> 01:29:59.120]
Ah, see.

[01:29:59.380 --> 01:30:01.560]
Marine Dowd, better to have a praise of Jack.

[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:04.340]
Just don't call it annesty.

[01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:05.260]
What year is that from?

[01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:06.600]
Is that the one?

[01:30:07.220 --> 01:30:07.840]
June 27th.

[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:08.660]
That's today.

[01:30:08.780 --> 01:30:10.660]
That must be the one owner that's by John Tierney.

[01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:13.100]
What the hell is my Marine Dowd for Christ's sake?

[01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:15.340]
Well, why don't you just print it out and fax it to me?

[01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:15.900]
How's that?

[01:30:16.420 --> 01:30:20.300]
We'll go through all of this time consuming a ponderous crap.

[01:30:20.780 --> 01:30:23.520]
I mean, we have enough time consuming ponderous crap like these calls, you know.

[01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:25.440]
We do have 942 votes.

[01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:27.160]
I told you we'd have that 1000 by 1 o'clock.

[01:30:27.180 --> 01:30:29.560]
And I think by 1230, we're going to have 1000 votes.

[01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:30.520]
How do you like that?

[01:30:30.940 --> 01:30:32.940]
Put that in your pot pipe and smoke it, Mr.

[01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:40.040]
A seaport in Ventura County, Northwest of Los Angeles was reopened yesterday after a four-hour investigation

[01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:43.580]
of a potential terror threat turned up nothing suspicious.

[01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:47.900]
Just like all those evil doers in Liberty City, baby, all those Shmata heads.

[01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:48.860]
Nothing.

[01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:49.800]
We didn't look.

[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.220]
The government doesn't want to get you nervous.

[01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:52.700]
I'd like Michael Morrison.

[01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:55.620]
In fact, that seemed to be the underlying theme all throughout Fair and High and High and 11.

[01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:56.720]
It was the Boogie Man.

[01:30:57.260 --> 01:30:58.000]
Now, who was in that again?

[01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:00.680]
The kid from 7th Heaven, Barry Watson.

[01:31:00.900 --> 01:31:01.120]
Okay.

[01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:02.480]
Why am I sharp or what?

[01:31:02.620 --> 01:31:03.720]
I need a lot more of the key points.

[01:31:04.420 --> 01:31:04.920]
Barry Watson.

[01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:06.100]
It's elementary.

[01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:06.800]
My dear Watson.

[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:18.720]
Authorities closed off the port of Junimi, a junimi in Ventura County after a dock worker discovered a message squaldened marker on a metal pillar in a hold of a ship carrying bananas from Guatemala,

[01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:20.840]
said Will Burgh, the ports marketing director.

[01:31:21.180 --> 01:31:22.000]
It was carrying bananas.

[01:31:23.140 --> 01:31:28.140]
Burgh said the message read, this nitro is for you, Mr. George W. Bush and your Jewish cronies.

[01:31:29.020 --> 01:31:34.400]
Federal authorities gave a slightly different version saying the ink message was nitro plus sign glycerin.

[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:37.140]
My gift for GW Bush and his Jewish gang.

[01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:40.200]
About 20 people aboard the ship, a 30,000 ton.

[01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:42.160]
30,000 ton.

[01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:43.160]
About 30,000, man.

[01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:47.580]
Refrigerated vessel that arrived from the port of Ketsal in Guatemala were evacuated.

[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:51.500]
Workers already outside the port were being kept out, although anyone inside was not a remain.

[01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:55.840]
FBI spokeswoman Laura, I, I, I, I, Miller said agents were at the scene but wouldn't come.

[01:31:55.940 --> 01:31:56.600]
There was nothing.

[01:31:57.400 --> 01:31:59.220]
Zipity to the port is northwest of LA.

[01:31:59.460 --> 01:32:00.140]
There was nothing there.

[01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:05.900]
I mean, after all, if you're going to make a terrorist attack, don't, don't the terrorists always like write out some kind of a,

[01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:07.140]
they scroll a message ahead of time.

[01:32:07.140 --> 01:32:08.540]
They do the recall in the bomb threat.

[01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:10.020]
They give you lots of warning.

[01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:10.780]
Exactly.

[01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:13.280]
947 boats on a pool.

[01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:14.240]
I'm pretty impressed by that.

[01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:15.060]
It's still in 56.

[01:32:15.620 --> 01:32:16.280]
Not even new yet.

[01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:18.080]
We almost got our thousand boats.

[01:32:18.220 --> 01:32:19.200]
By the way, there is no article.

[01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:20.180]
Right.

[01:32:20.420 --> 01:32:23.080]
I thought you just got through telling me that's the name of her book.

[01:32:23.340 --> 01:32:24.680]
It was a link to a book that he saw.

[01:32:24.980 --> 01:32:28.120]
Well, there may be the article is the one, well, what's it got to talk about?

[01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:30.200]
Well, ain't an accent, no, that's for sure.

[01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:32.500]
Are you, are you, are you sure positive?

[01:32:32.820 --> 01:32:33.080]
Positive.

[01:32:33.340 --> 01:32:35.060]
Well, why would a guy call in and make that up?

[01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:37.520]
Gee, I don't know why would somebody call and make up a bunch of crap.

[01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:40.000]
Oh, this is about the Miami gang.

[01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:41.440]
Well, I'm going to read this one.

[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:45.620]
This is from, and I'm glad that he pointed that out because I don't think I ever did send this one along to you.

[01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:48.120]
From a couple days ago to you got it now.

[01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:49.940]
I've got, you know, I just did a search.

[01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:50.820]
I'm talking about Josh.

[01:32:51.260 --> 01:32:51.540]
Hooray.

[01:32:52.460 --> 01:32:54.060]
I don't, don't take that kind of an altitude.

[01:32:54.440 --> 01:32:56.320]
Although the bad news, you got some bad news though, coming.

[01:32:56.500 --> 01:32:57.220]
You want to know what it is?

[01:32:57.220 --> 01:32:58.100]
Oh, Jesus, what?

[01:32:58.700 --> 01:33:00.380]
My election is working just fine now.

[01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:05.440]
See, when election has issues, it's always early in the morning, you know, like between 9 and 10 or 11,

[01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:06.920]
then all of a sudden it works like magic.

[01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:07.760]
Fantastic.

[01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:12.400]
So I would anticipate, because look, let's face it, I'm not doing a lot during the summertime.

[01:33:12.820 --> 01:33:15.580]
I might as well send you like four or five hundred stories for it as well.

[01:33:15.660 --> 01:33:16.780]
Josh says he's not doing that much.

[01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:17.720]
He's not doing nothing.

[01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:19.640]
Okay, just that Russian chick, that's all he's doing.

[01:33:19.740 --> 01:33:21.640]
Plus, get a little drunk every night.

[01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:25.540]
11.58 probably that vodka that she's, you know, hooked on.

[01:33:26.300 --> 01:33:26.660]
What?

[01:33:26.820 --> 01:33:27.520]
What are you laughing about?

[01:33:27.940 --> 01:33:28.860]
No vodka in your house?

[01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:30.580]
Well, she doesn't just keep the vodka.

[01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:33.600]
You know, sometimes it's the things that you can't see that hurt you.

And Dave Broward of the Palm reaches called ROT Concepts today at 1-800-248-5071.

[01:34:38.140 --> 01:34:42.900]
That's 1-800-248-5071 around the wicked web, dryconcepts.com.

[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:45.320]
This is Neil Rogers.

[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:49.500]
This is 5-62-AM.

[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:56.040]
Well, it beat at 12-1-1 on WQ-AM.

[01:34:56.320 --> 01:35:01.940]
Well, I've never thought I'd find the kind of ride that I've been to the round days today.

[01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:07.500]
Now, it's a classic city where you'll stick stuff away a river would fly here.

[01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:13.940]
Now, if it's needed time, and if the drink is cold, then it dies to the spicy.

[01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:16.200]
I've got the candle liquid cherry, yo.

[01:35:17.220 --> 01:35:18.420]
Oh, baby.

[01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:23.060]
The cream I've got out of Jerry Jerry's be baby, Bruce.

[01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:24.980]
Oh, baby.

[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:28.200]
Shiny little little little baby.

[01:35:28.660 --> 01:35:32.980]
He took the susprits, chit, down to a downstaffer road in a bit.

[01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:34.520]
That is super bad way.

[01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:40.460]
Now, if the artist stop the big deals, I'll say I'll get around the pictures of the praise.

[01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:45.100]
A 1979 album, oh, Carolina.

[01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:48.780]
So looking by now, it's my baby, Carolina.

[01:35:49.660 --> 01:35:50.840]
Oh, baby.

[01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:58.100]
Oh, we're not gonna get the cherry, it beat at 12-1-1.

[01:35:58.620 --> 01:36:00.920]
Shiny little little little baby.

[01:36:01.740 --> 01:36:02.020]
Yo.

[01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:33.360]
I've got a window down on the hot summer day because the AC door would not wake.

[01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:39.320]
The sweating pressure loss eats fuss was failed and gets the tossing look at over time.

[01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:44.380]
I'm acting you find the shiny ground of smell like lime,

[01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:47.940]
and I'm going to make my coffee giant and do this, I've been washing it with all the roll.

[01:36:48.980 --> 01:36:50.120]
Don't long be here.

[01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:54.800]
Over the cold out of Jerry Jerry, baby, Bruce.

[01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:56.360]
Oh, baby.

[01:36:57.620 --> 01:36:59.120]
I'm going to drop it, Bruce.

[01:36:59.300 --> 01:37:01.100]
Going over Steve Lufz and Bruce.

[01:37:01.100 --> 01:37:04.100]
Don baby, Bruce.

[01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:05.520]
Go ahead, Jerry.

[01:37:05.780 --> 01:37:09.800]
You'll be fancy to be thinking, don baby.

[01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:16.600]
I special request today that simple jackass Tony Snow wanted to hear that.

[01:37:16.980 --> 01:37:22.060]
12-0-4-5-60, they started the second half in Germany where this game has been played as it in Stuttgart.

[01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:23.200]
I don't know where it is somewhere.

[01:37:23.780 --> 01:37:27.920]
And it's Brazil to the nil over the gunner we have seen.

[01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:31.340]
Every time it takes a shot, it's like 20 yards over the top of the net.

[01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:35.480]
So, Marine Dowd wrote a couple of days ago, three days ago to be exact, we need Chloe.

[01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:36.260]
Okay.

[01:37:36.820 --> 01:37:39.320]
She said, you think Michael should have put something more important to do?

[01:37:39.660 --> 01:37:44.560]
The hapless online security chief could snatch more money away from American locales more likely to hit by Alcada.

[01:37:44.900 --> 01:37:47.200]
Or let another wonderful city fall into a watery of this.

[01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:51.900]
Or go on TV and help people news hack the saga of the Mime Gang of Terrace wannabes

[01:37:51.900 --> 01:37:54.840]
who looked like they couldn't find the local series, let alone the series tower.

[01:37:54.840 --> 01:37:59.340]
These guys were so lame they asked in informant for boots, radios, binoculars, uniforms, and cash,

[01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:02.340]
believing he was Alcada and that the hares need uniforms.

[01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:06.760]
Instead, the cadaverist churroff was galvaning on stage yesterday morning, meaning Thursday,

[01:38:07.020 --> 01:38:09.840]
with some fictional counter-terrorism experts from 24.

[01:38:10.420 --> 01:38:13.320]
The producers writer and three actors from the Fox show appeared at an event,

[01:38:13.580 --> 01:38:17.580]
sponsored by the Heritage Foundation, at the Ronald Reagan Building International Trade Center.

[01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:21.260]
Throwing out his old scripts, Mr. Reagan was a master of mixing fiction, in fact,

[01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:23.460]
but he was a piker compared with the Bush crowd.

[01:38:23.460 --> 01:38:27.860]
The audience included clearance Thomas and his wife, Ginny, who welded in with these Supreme Courthirs

[01:38:27.860 --> 01:38:29.680]
day for the Tinseltown Therber grade.

[01:38:30.220 --> 01:38:34.960]
Rush Limbaugh, who said the Dictinian Rummy were huge fans of 24, was master's ceremonies for the panel.

[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:38.840]
Oh, maybe that's what he needed to vibrate for, to get up to the occasion.

[01:38:39.340 --> 01:38:43.140]
He was MC of the panel titled 24 in America's Imaging Fighting Terrorism.

[01:38:43.420 --> 01:38:44.560]
Fact fiction doesn't matter.

[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:48.860]
It doesn't in this administration, Marine says, better to have a panel and praise the Jack Bauer

[01:38:48.860 --> 01:38:52.540]
than admit we have no real Jack Bauer to find Osama and his murderous acolytes.

[01:38:52.540 --> 01:38:56.920]
Better to pretend that rounding up a bunch of Florida losers, whose plan was more aspirational

[01:38:56.920 --> 01:39:02.180]
and operational as one FBI official put it, is a great blow in the war on terror than to really turn our intelligence agencies

[01:39:02.180 --> 01:39:06.620]
and home on security into the relentless resourceful and fearsome organizations there in fiction,

[01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:08.660]
and should be given the billion spent on them.

[01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:15.320]
Lawled by our spy thrillers and Tom Clancy novels, we used to take regretted that our intelligence agencies were just as capable of heroes on the screen.

[01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:22.120]
Jack Rhyne, either the Harrison Ford or Alec Baldwin, or even the Ben Affleck version, could have gotten Osama single handily in the two hours allotted.

[01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:30.420]
Even though they still haven't captured the theme behind 9-11, W and Dick Cheney still blend fact in fiction by using 9-11 to justify their wrong-hit adventure in Iraq.

[01:39:31.020 --> 01:39:36.980]
As the Vice President told CNN's John King this week when he was asked about his claim that we would be greeted as liberators in Iraq,

[01:39:37.300 --> 01:39:40.660]
it doesn't make any sense for people to think that somehow we can retreat behind our oceans,

[01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:45.680]
leave the Middle East, walk away from Iraq, and we'll be safe and secure here at home. 9-11 put the light of that.

[01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:50.740]
And in Macabre, metric of improvement, Dr. Death also noted that things were looking up, Dr. Death.

[01:39:50.740 --> 01:39:55.640]
There were a lot more Iraqis becoming casualties in this conflicted prison because they're now in the fight he said, surely.

[01:39:56.120 --> 01:40:03.020]
Some of W's closest allies have begun privately calling Vice an absolute disaster, but when will W realize how twisted his logic is?

[01:40:03.340 --> 01:40:11.020]
In the new book, the 1% doctrine, Ron Sustine writes that CIA officials refer to Mr. Cheney as Edgar, as an Edgar Berger and Charlotte McCarthy,

[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:19.680]
and that W had asked his debontering second to pull back a little at meetings and not offer him advice in crowded rooms so they could continue to pretend Mr. Cheney was not the puppet master.

[01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:25.320]
What sounds like that Mickey Eisner bit? On the homeland security said Mr. Chudoff,

[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:32.620]
fighting by the actors who played the beautiful Techno-Geek Chloe in President Logan, seemed a little fuzzy about whether the fancy technology on 24 really exists.

[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:39.480]
He noted one thing you don't see on 24 is when the computer is crashing and having to get the IT people to come into reboot and get the computer working again.

[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:46.580]
Given that the FBI is struggling to get a computer system that can simultaneously search for flight and schools, his answer was not all that funny.

[01:40:46.580 --> 01:40:53.720]
Asked about the slicing of anti-terrorism money given in New York, he replied that we put a lot of extra money in a northern New Jersey while I feel better already.

[01:40:54.080 --> 01:41:00.500]
Mr. Limbaugh, slightly suggested the producers give Jack Murtha a cameo as KGB chief, he praised 24 for giving torture a good name.

[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:08.200]
This past season, he should began exploring what happens when a Nixonian president becomes so obsessed with national security that he starts undermining the country's laws.

[01:41:08.740 --> 01:41:10.900]
That's the kind of fishing you hate to see become fact.

[01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:17.300]
Thanks to the actor calling in because this may or may not be the article. It's quite frankly, I don't give a great but how do you like that?

[01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:17.760]

[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:26.920]
They played 56 minutes and 57 minutes almost at the World Cup and it's still Brazil to the nil over the Ghana.

[01:41:27.020 --> 01:41:28.400]
There's I think a yellow card.

[01:41:28.660 --> 01:41:30.080]
I guess as you want to vote.

[01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:31.980]
Yellow card, look out now.

[01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:33.720]
I'm nervous.

[01:41:34.580 --> 01:41:38.300]
This is such a prissy sissy and when you think didn't the Brits invent this crap?

[01:41:38.300 --> 01:41:39.400]
What soccer?

[01:41:39.780 --> 01:41:40.920]
Yeah, I have no idea.

[01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:41.960]
It had to be.

[01:41:42.140 --> 01:41:42.880]
What have to be?

[01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:49.260]
They invented all the prissy sissy stuff and of course back in the days of the British Empire, that's when they spread this disease around the world.

[01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:50.600]
I thought they were just cricket.

[01:41:51.140 --> 01:41:52.260]
No, that's the other thing.

[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:55.640]
Oh, in fact, I'm so glad you mentioned that to show you how silly the British are.

[01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:02.580]
You know how it's going on about the BBC and how great their news is and their such great intellectuals that give you the real truth instead of nothing but propaganda.

[01:42:02.580 --> 01:42:06.240]
Well, one BBC newscaster I watched when I was over there last week in Berlin.

[01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:10.440]
The lead story breathlessly presented by the presenter.

[01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:14.140]
China, maybe on the way to a world domination in cricket.

[01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:16.120]
Can you believe that?

[01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:16.780]
No.

[01:42:17.220 --> 01:42:19.420]
Oh, I'll shout again 50 yards over the goal by the guy.

[01:42:19.980 --> 01:42:21.080]
By the way, some of them.

[01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:22.400]
Yes, what's Scrum?

[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:28.600]
Scrum is like in rugby when they all get down and they throw the ball in the middle and they all get down and start grabbing it and they get dirty.

[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:30.420]
That was the way it is. It's down and dirty.

[01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:31.880]
That's a Scrum.

[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:37.940]
And they also have, we talked about this though before I went on vacation, we do a squash but I just didn't know what the hell I was.

[01:42:38.100 --> 01:42:42.200]
No, seriously, I'm not talking about summer squash that you read. I'm talking about the game.

[01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:42.840]
Yeah.

[01:42:43.300 --> 01:42:44.140]
You ever heard a squash?

[01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:44.860]
I have, yeah.

[01:42:45.380 --> 01:42:49.240]
And is that where they also have a Scrum? I can't separate all these silly-ass brick-game.

[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:51.760]
I mean, a Scrum is like a bat and a ball.

[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:52.620]
Is it?

[01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:53.380]
I think so.

[01:42:53.380 --> 01:42:53.720]
No, no, no.

[01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:54.500]
You're taking a cricket.

[01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:56.820]
Cricket is the silly-ass style of the paddle.

[01:42:57.060 --> 01:43:00.520]
But I mean, like a bat that shaped like a paddle, squash has a paddle.

[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:03.360]
And it's a 386 for seven.

[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:05.300]
I have no idea what they're talking about.

[01:43:05.420 --> 01:43:06.940]
The Brits are leading Australia.

[01:43:07.260 --> 01:43:08.240]
386 for seven.

[01:43:08.620 --> 01:43:08.820]
What?

[01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:11.260]
We got 971 hosts tonight.

[01:43:11.380 --> 01:43:12.720]
Today we have a thousand, oh, look at that.

[01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:14.220]
Was that one of the Brazil guys there?

[01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:15.260]
And they were holding his head.

[01:43:15.380 --> 01:43:18.640]
Oh, boy.

[01:43:20.340 --> 01:43:22.240]
He said my pops like a weird pit today.

[01:43:22.300 --> 01:43:22.960]
I don't know what I mean.

[01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:24.620]
I got a bad headache.

[01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:28.940]
There is a Brazil coachman, Oscar Aguera Pereira José Amanas.

[01:43:29.540 --> 01:43:29.980]
Yeah, you're right.

[01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:30.860]
I'm getting tired of Brazil.

[01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:32.180]
Everybody hates them like poison.

[01:43:32.180 --> 01:43:33.320]
Enough with this crap already.

[01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:34.800]
971 hosts.

[01:43:34.820 --> 01:43:36.000]
What's your take on the World Cup?

[01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:38.060]
La Copa de Aluindo.

[01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:39.340]
You know how you say it?

[01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:39.880]
Okay.

[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:41.960]
Well, I was in the name of the song, wasn't it?

[01:43:42.260 --> 01:43:43.200]
La Copa de Alavida.

[01:43:43.980 --> 01:43:45.160]
La Copa de Alavida?

[01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:46.100]
Wasn't that it?

[01:43:46.580 --> 01:43:47.440]
Good idea out of here.

[01:43:47.660 --> 01:43:48.240]
You're the Ricky Martin.

[01:43:48.300 --> 01:43:49.260]
I guess I did.

[01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:51.500]
Oh, yeah, I'm the real Ricky Martin fan.

[01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:54.720]
971 hosts.

[01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:55.740]
What's your take on the World Cup?

[01:43:56.040 --> 01:43:57.380]
Soccer is so boring.

[01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:00.360]
358 people wise enough to realize that.

[01:44:00.540 --> 01:44:01.620]
I could suck in by the hype.

[01:44:02.100 --> 01:44:03.820]
Moderately interested, 259.

[01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:06.620]
Well, that's good because we're keeping you abreast of the score all day here.

[01:44:07.140 --> 01:44:07.460]
I love it.

[01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:10.940]
Watching it on TV, 202, which means there's 200 people that we don't have right now.

[01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:12.820]
Maybe they're listening and watching at the same time.

[01:44:13.060 --> 01:44:14.820]
Seeing them from giving an accurate rub down.

[01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:16.200]
What's the World Cup?

[01:44:16.340 --> 01:44:16.680]
78.

[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:18.620]
That's 76.

[01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:22.900]
As boring as watching any of this sport, that's George again being a sour pusse.

[01:44:22.940 --> 01:44:23.200]
That's right.

[01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:24.640]
By the way, the watch uses a racket.

[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:25.000]
48.

[01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:26.480]
And I hit this full 29.

[01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:27.700]
You rack it?

[01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:29.420]
Yeah, and you bounce it off the walls.

[01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:30.420]
And the ball too.

[01:44:30.740 --> 01:44:32.060]
Yeah, you rack it and you rack it?

[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:32.600]
Well, that's good.

[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:32.780]
That's right.

[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:34.080]
Squash.

[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:35.660]
I don't mind spaghetti squash.

[01:44:35.740 --> 01:44:36.200]
Do you ever have that?

[01:44:36.500 --> 01:44:37.880]
We're like a little bit of pasta sounds.

[01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:38.900]
It's not big on the squash.

[01:44:38.900 --> 01:44:40.480]
Well, my mother used to make that all the time.

[01:44:40.660 --> 01:44:42.600]
Because in there, we have a lot of butter and salt.

[01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:44.020]
Butter?

[01:44:44.500 --> 01:44:44.720]
Yeah.

[01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:45.840]
Are you out of your mind or what?

[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:47.620]
Do you ever try that?

[01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:48.640]
Can't believe it's not butter?

[01:44:49.140 --> 01:44:49.380]
Yeah.

[01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:50.120]
It's margarine.

[01:44:50.740 --> 01:44:52.520]
I thought margarine is supposed to be really bad for it.

[01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:52.760]
It is.

[01:44:53.340 --> 01:44:55.260]
Well, how come they call it a can't believe it's not butter?

[01:44:55.340 --> 01:44:56.440]
I kid they say it's not butter.

[01:44:56.440 --> 01:44:56.820]
It's not butter.

[01:44:56.960 --> 01:44:57.820]
It's margarine you, Jack.

[01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:00.620]
It's like a lot of trans fats in it.

[01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:01.700]
You know what tastes more like butter?

[01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:02.740]
What's that?

[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:03.360]

[01:45:03.620 --> 01:45:03.900]
No.

[01:45:04.420 --> 01:45:06.200]
How about a salt free butter?

[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:06.800]
Okay.

[01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:07.860]
I like it salty myself.

[01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:09.100]
Lando lakes.

[01:45:09.620 --> 01:45:09.780]
Mmm.

[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:12.280]
I got some nice hot potato bread.

[01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:13.540]
Tatebane.

[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:14.100]
Mmm.

[01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:15.340]
Olioliva.

[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:20.500]
Let's kill Eli Wallick before somebody else gets him first.

[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:22.460]
Did we decide that he's alive or dead?

[01:45:22.760 --> 01:45:23.300]
The Googler.

[01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:24.200]
I think he's alive.

[01:45:24.580 --> 01:45:25.320]
Oh, what a shame.

[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:29.440]
From 13th Bob Weaver, we lose Weaver, the weatherman, and we still got Eli Wallick.

[01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:30.400]
I can't close the short right there.

[01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:30.980]
There is no God.

[01:45:31.340 --> 01:45:31.760]
There is only.

[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:32.680]
There is no God.

[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:35.800]
If you think you might have termites in your home and vote, we're in the middle of that

[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:39.840]
humid hurricane season and termite season, do it yourself a big favor and call our friends

[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:42.600]
at Riddet Pest Control today for a free termite inspection.

[01:45:43.080 --> 01:45:43.700]
There is no obligation.

[01:45:43.900 --> 01:45:44.480]
Now they came to your home.

[01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:45.000]
What do they find?

[01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:45.560]
What do they do?

[01:45:46.220 --> 01:45:47.620]
They haven't done anything yet, but they're going to.

[01:45:48.300 --> 01:45:50.380]
Boy, like if it's raining, what does that mean?

[01:45:51.140 --> 01:45:53.500]
They just, they need to hire some extra people to take care of my house.

[01:45:54.060 --> 01:45:55.300]
That wouldn't be surprised at all.

[01:45:55.380 --> 01:45:57.340]
I'm sure there's plenty of varmants crawling around in there.

[01:45:57.480 --> 01:45:57.960]
And critters.

[01:45:58.340 --> 01:46:01.920]
Riddet Pest Control uses that amazing orange oil free when the kill's termites and their

[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:03.000]
eyes on are present on contact.

[01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:05.340]
They're gone fast and they can say Georgia is a slob.

[01:46:05.660 --> 01:46:07.720]
If you have termites, it's the best possible way to get rid of them.

When they're done treating your property, the only thing left behind is the clean set

[01:46:54.660 --> 01:46:58.740]
By the way, he's next to go 1-800-447-4348.

[01:46:59.060 --> 01:47:01.200]
This is Mule Rogers.

[01:47:02.180 --> 01:47:05.520]
This is 560-Q-A-S.

[01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:09.860]
She fakes orgasms, I fake four-play.

[01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:10.940]
Hi, Jesus here.

[01:47:11.340 --> 01:47:15.280]
I know I'm often pictured with a beard, but the truth is, I don't like beards.

[01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:16.220]
They itch.

[01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:17.080]
A lot.

[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:20.420]
That's why I use the new Shaking Tennanov-Late Hyper-Raser.

[01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:22.620]
It gives me such a clean, close shave.

[01:47:23.020 --> 01:47:23.740]
It's a miracle.

[01:47:24.580 --> 01:47:27.720]
Really, just the other day I was walking into the town square.

[01:47:28.140 --> 01:47:30.260]
I was there to have lunch with my good friend Jesus.

[01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:32.300]
Hey, Judas.

[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:33.960]
Hey, Judas.

[01:47:34.140 --> 01:47:36.140]
Jesus, didn't recognize me, did you?

[01:47:36.260 --> 01:47:37.500]
Christ almighty, you shave!

[01:47:37.820 --> 01:47:39.860]
Braille, have you heard the good news?

[01:47:41.380 --> 01:47:42.340]
Jesus, shave.

[01:47:43.340 --> 01:47:46.860]
Jesus will not shave you, but you can shave.

[01:47:47.300 --> 01:47:47.960]
I like Jesus.

[01:47:48.300 --> 01:47:48.960]
Have you been shaved?

[01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:52.560]
If not, get the new Shaking Tennanov-Late Hyper-Raser today.

[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:54.400]
And have an amazing place.

[01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:58.440]
Amazing place, Jesus, all my friends.

[01:47:58.740 --> 01:48:00.400]
The Shaking Tennanov-Late Hyper-Raser.

[01:48:00.500 --> 01:48:01.280]
A proof by the Pope.

[01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:04.780]
Called 19 and 560, it's a close shave for the Pope, I guess, huh?

[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:05.640]
Oh, that's cute.

[01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:08.780]
The rye shout writes in the progressive, at least for this and Nazi Pope.

[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:10.920]
I wonder if he was at the end of the games.

[01:48:11.620 --> 01:48:12.240]
Yes, sir.

[01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:14.420]
I think he's a teenager.

[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:15.440]
Are you watching in the middle?

[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:17.920]
Watching?

[01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:24.140]
This is for these people, I am on any yards up in the year, so we can.

[01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:29.140]
61 minutes gone by and a big tremendous soccer match at the La Copa de El Mundo.

[01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:32.320]
And it's Brazil, 2-0 against the Ghananese.

[01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:36.340]
Matthew Rossi, out in the progressive, I'm not going to start reading all about your stuff here, am I?

[01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:36.660]
Yes.

[01:48:37.020 --> 01:48:39.720]
What you sure as hell don't do what I got to make up for in these two days right here,

[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:41.600]
to bring us up to date, everybody's in the dark now.

[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:44.180]
Yeah, the only thing we know about is, and he's pretty dark.

[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:46.140]
I wonder if he's wearing his icy sleeve.

[01:48:47.580 --> 01:48:51.500]
In fact, you know, he used to be the race caller at Woodbine, and now he's at Western Fear,

[01:48:51.580 --> 01:48:53.040]
because he lives over here right now.

[01:48:53.380 --> 01:48:53.960]
Frank Salive.

[01:48:54.820 --> 01:48:55.600]
That's his name.

[01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:57.220]
He's a great race caller, man.

[01:48:57.380 --> 01:48:58.380]
I wonder what's up in Salive.

[01:48:58.820 --> 01:48:58.900]
Yes.

[01:48:58.900 --> 01:49:01.700]
Anyway, Matthew Rossi, out writes, Bush goes after the New York Times.

[01:49:02.260 --> 01:49:04.180]
Remember freedom of speech and impression, things like that?

[01:49:04.820 --> 01:49:05.960]
No, I guess you have a good memory.

[01:49:06.500 --> 01:49:11.960]
Back to the late 1790s under the alien and sedition acts, then during the Civil War and again during WWI,

[01:49:12.260 --> 01:49:13.700]
the government prosecuted editors.

[01:49:13.700 --> 01:49:17.060]
It's not a practice that thrills me as an editor writes Matthew Rossi.

[01:49:17.540 --> 01:49:17.740]
Oh.

[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:22.040]
Or should it thrill you for that matter, because it's about his blatant violation of the first amendment as there is,

[01:49:22.380 --> 01:49:26.040]
but that didn't stop Representative Peter King, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee,

[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:28.260]
from one of the get the cuffs on the editors in the New York Times.

[01:49:28.700 --> 01:49:32.220]
We're at war, he said, and for the times to really send information about secret operations,

[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:33.600]
and methods is treasonous.

[01:49:34.020 --> 01:49:37.660]
King said he would ask Attorney General Alberto Vio V Jose, him and his Gonzalez,

[01:49:38.060 --> 01:49:41.500]
to begin an investigation and prosecute the New York Times, the reporters, the editors,

[01:49:41.500 --> 01:49:44.420]
the publisher, people who read it, all of these, everybody on the street corner.

[01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:50.940]
Dick Cheney also dumped on the Times saying that some of the news media take it upon themselves to disclose vital national security programs.

[01:49:51.260 --> 01:49:53.880]
This most offensiveized president said that offends me.

[01:49:54.480 --> 01:50:00.080]
Taking his cue from Cheney as usual, Bush on Monday said, for people who leaked that program and for a newspaper to publish it,

[01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:02.140]
this great harm to the United States of America.

[01:50:02.540 --> 01:50:04.840]
The revelation he had, it makes it harder to win the war on terror.

[01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:08.720]
And Gonzalez himself is supposed to be the leading law enforcement officer of the U.S.

[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:13.400]
and his sworn-uapolda constitution has also been warning ominously about prosecuting journalists.

[01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:21.680]
What King Cheney Bush Gonzalez and many right-wing punnets don't seem to appreciate is that we the American people need to have a free press to check the excesses of government.

[01:50:22.060 --> 01:50:27.240]
Such a free press has never been needed more so than today when the Bush administration has taken excess to the Nth degree.

[01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:30.300]
To my eyes, the New York Times has been aggressive enough.

[01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:32.880]
It held the NSA spying story for more than a year.

[01:50:33.180 --> 01:50:37.880]
It led Judith Miller cozy up to the Iraq War cheerleaders and placed some of their propaganda on the front page.

[01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:42.460]
Our biggest failures have generally been when we failed to dig deep enough or to report fully enough bill,

[01:50:42.580 --> 01:50:45.520]
Keller editor at times, acknowledging letter to readers on June 25.

[01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:49.800]
He also revealed this to us solicitous the times has become of the administration's views.

[01:50:50.340 --> 01:50:54.240]
Our decision to publish the story of the administration's penetration of the international banking system

[01:50:54.240 --> 01:50:57.600]
followed weeks of discussion between the administration officials and the times,

[01:50:57.900 --> 01:51:01.720]
not only the reporter who wrote this story, but senior editors including me Keller wrote.

[01:51:02.020 --> 01:51:06.120]
We listen patiently and attentively, we wait the most heavily the administration's concern

[01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:08.380]
that describing this program would endanger it.

[01:51:08.860 --> 01:51:12.880]
But the president doesn't deserve a seat at the editorial meetings of the New York Times or any other newspaper.

[01:51:13.180 --> 01:51:16.180]
That's not his place. He's commander in chief, not editor in chief.

[01:51:16.540 --> 01:51:21.880]
It's up to us reporters and editors and publishers to decide what is news, not the branch of government that's supposed to be covering.

[01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:26.160]
Once the president takes over that job, the fourth estate is totally lost its function.

[01:51:26.620 --> 01:51:30.940]
So before Gonzales, Cheney, Bush and King throw Bill Keller and Arthur Salzberger Jr. in the who's go,

[01:51:31.140 --> 01:51:34.900]
they might want to consult a copy of the Constitution if they can still find one laying around.

[01:51:34.900 --> 01:51:38.160]
You know that piece of paper, that crappy horse of ball piece of paper,

[01:51:38.240 --> 01:51:42.060]
a table piece of paper like your president said, and I repeat your president.

[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.520]
993, what did I tell you about 1230, we'd have a thousand votes.

[01:51:45.700 --> 01:51:47.320]
Well, I'm telling you, I am as sharp as a marble.

[01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:50.300]
And it's all ain't all stick.

[01:51:50.980 --> 01:51:54.500]
Oh boy, 64 and almost 65 minutes gone by.

[01:51:55.160 --> 01:51:58.240]
Are you keeping track of this? You know, you also keep in track of the extra time.

[01:51:58.680 --> 01:51:58.760]
Huh?

[01:51:59.400 --> 01:52:03.980]
Well, you know, soccer is the only game that I can think of where there's a time factor involved.

[01:52:03.980 --> 01:52:06.840]
I mean, there's some sports like baseball, where there's a time factor.

[01:52:07.260 --> 01:52:07.400]
Yeah.

[01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:09.360]
The only one I can think of where the clock never stops.

[01:52:09.480 --> 01:52:11.740]
Ever to my knowledge except that it has time.

[01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:17.140]
It just keeps running and running and running and like, you know, like a time X.

[01:52:17.420 --> 01:52:18.220]
So that's it.

[01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:20.440]
Like the energizer bunny.

[01:52:21.340 --> 01:52:22.900]
Just keeps going on and on.

[01:52:23.220 --> 01:52:27.500]
And then of course there's always that extra time that the referee decides he's got his own little stopwatch.

[01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:30.500]
And depending on who he bet on, he decides how much extra time is going to be.

[01:52:30.740 --> 01:52:32.380]
Look at you, you're a big soccer guru now.

[01:52:32.380 --> 01:52:35.020]
Hey, I know my crap, Mr. Let me tell you right now.

[01:52:35.400 --> 01:52:38.260]
I know my Ronaldo from Brazil from that Ronaldo guy from Portugal.

[01:52:39.220 --> 01:52:40.260]
Who's ill in right now?

[01:52:40.380 --> 01:52:41.980]
Let's see, here's a fact from Andy and Miami Beach.

[01:52:42.140 --> 01:52:45.700]
He says, as if we didn't already know this, we're definitely living in a police state.

[01:52:46.020 --> 01:52:48.840]
Mickey Harrison got up to make a speech after the heat one live on ABC.

[01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:53.040]
And ABC bleeped him out when he said these guys worked their asses off.

[01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:55.100]
Oh my god, Mickey Harrison said ass.

[01:52:55.300 --> 01:52:56.420]
Oh, brother.

[01:52:56.860 --> 01:53:00.040]
It was also pretty funny when Harrison mistakenly said during his speech at the parade.

[01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:01.020]
Stay white.

[01:53:01.620 --> 01:53:02.540]
Well, what does that mean?

[01:53:03.140 --> 01:53:04.860]
Well, white hot was the...

[01:53:04.860 --> 01:53:05.400]
I know that.

[01:53:05.540 --> 01:53:06.260]
What you're gonna call it, yeah.

[01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:06.660]
Yeah.

[01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:08.240]
Well, what if you don't want to stay white?

[01:53:08.560 --> 01:53:08.840]
What does that mean?

[01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:09.620]
You put on like L.D.

[01:53:09.620 --> 01:53:11.980]
And you put on black face, go on in the sun and get you the tan.

[01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:17.300]
Also, a 790, the ticket at a promotion, we're handing out pictures of David Hasselhoff to the Strat-Newisky.

[01:53:18.060 --> 01:53:22.860]
AA Arena security guards were told to confiscate them since the heat station is WIOD.

[01:53:23.580 --> 01:53:28.480]
I know that this is a running joker, but they're actually his arrest warrant now in Washington Avenue and South Beach called the Somyang guy.

[01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:29.520]
Oh, isn't that great?

[01:53:29.780 --> 01:53:30.760]
What's wrong with Somyang guy?

[01:53:31.460 --> 01:53:32.380]
Depends on who you're talking about.

[01:53:32.740 --> 01:53:33.680]
Well, I wouldn't...

[01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:34.220]
I think...

[01:53:34.220 --> 01:53:35.720]
I want the shoot right now, okay?

[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.080]
I want it right away.

[01:53:37.160 --> 01:53:42.400]
Oh, oh, somebody tried to get me served your guy.

[01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:44.000]
How have you done that?

[01:53:44.620 --> 01:53:45.200]
At any rate?

[01:53:46.380 --> 01:53:50.140]
560, 705, 60, 0.5, 60, and leave a ride and sing it a wireless line.

[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:54.300]
997, boy, the timing on this is just staggering.

[01:53:54.680 --> 01:53:56.680]
Oh, this one of the gononiza guys.

[01:53:57.560 --> 01:53:58.700]
Now holding his...

[01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:00.020]
Oh, geez.

[01:54:01.020 --> 01:54:02.100]
I think he got need in the nuts.

[01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:04.280]
Thousand votes, boys and girls.

[01:54:04.460 --> 01:54:05.040]
How do you like that?

[01:54:05.460 --> 01:54:07.200]
Did I say by the time we got to 1230?

[01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:07.900]
Yeah.

[01:54:08.300 --> 01:54:09.140]
We're ahead of our schedule.

[01:54:09.300 --> 01:54:11.140]
So let's get that Marlon pre-games show on right now.

[01:54:11.220 --> 01:54:12.740]
Even though the game ate till 775.

[01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:15.100]
Marlon's in the temple bay devil race.

[01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:16.700]
Now, how many people we have there last night, Josh?

[01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:17.320]
You have any idea?

[01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:20.440]
Well, I watched it on TV and I'm going to go with about 700.

[01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:24.260]
But they won!

[01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:26.480]
There was a win in the room.

[01:54:26.600 --> 01:54:26.780]
They were there.

[01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:27.240]
They were there.

[01:54:27.260 --> 01:54:27.820]
They pulled it out.

[01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:28.600]
They won 8 to 5.

[01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:29.340]
They're at...

[01:54:29.340 --> 01:54:30.740]
They're talking about white hot.

[01:54:31.020 --> 01:54:32.000]
They are red hot.

[01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:34.380]
They're the hottest team in baseball the last month.

[01:54:34.540 --> 01:54:35.400]
Am I correct about that?

[01:54:36.180 --> 01:54:38.300]
For the past 20 games or something, yeah?

[01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:39.340]
Yes, yes I am.

[01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:41.540]
Of course that includes the 9G and Winnie Street, but nevertheless.

[01:54:41.860 --> 01:54:42.840]
Well, they're orange hot.

[01:54:43.080 --> 01:54:44.560]
And they have some stinkin' nerve, man.

[01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:47.080]
And after I left on vacation to sweep the blue jays that weekend.

[01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:48.760]
The blue jays run to verge of greatness.

[01:54:48.780 --> 01:54:49.800]
They were running a game out of first.

[01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:52.520]
And they come in to South Florida right away like a bunch of smartasses.

[01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:54.140]
But a bing, three in a row.

[01:54:54.300 --> 01:54:55.200]
They did that for you.

[01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:55.560]
They did that for you.

[01:54:55.560 --> 01:54:56.660]
They did that just a stick it to me.

[01:54:56.800 --> 01:54:58.160]
Okay, that's your Marlon organization.

[01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:00.300]
That was probably David Sampson getting even.

[01:55:00.700 --> 01:55:01.980]
Thousand and two votes on a pool.

[01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:03.440]
Each your heart's out across the street.

[01:55:03.780 --> 01:55:05.960]
That's more votes we got on a pool than you got listeners over there.

[01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:09.540]
With the juices loose and that's it bursting the Schwartz's cough.

[01:55:09.740 --> 01:55:10.360]
Whatever his name is.

[01:55:10.500 --> 01:55:11.100]
What's that guy's name?

[01:55:11.500 --> 01:55:11.620]
Who?

[01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:13.300]
That's the Schmerrall of course.

[01:55:13.300 --> 01:55:13.820]
Of course he called me.

[01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:14.340]
You have all.

[01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:15.420]
Look at that.

[01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:17.300]
Did you see that they came within a...

[01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:20.000]
Here's a hair lip of scoring gold.

[01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:20.700]
They got an ease.

[01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:21.800]
They got a weird name.

[01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:22.340]
What's it called?

[01:55:22.980 --> 01:55:24.120]
The Gone One Ease.

[01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:25.340]
I think they're called Goneers.

[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:26.300]
They were...

[01:55:26.300 --> 01:55:27.420]
Well they're going to be in this match.

[01:55:27.420 --> 01:55:28.600]
I'll say that they're Goneers.

[01:55:28.980 --> 01:55:30.700]
Hey, here's some good news for a lobster fest.

[01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:32.660]
It's back every Friday through Sunday at the Emerald Coast.

[01:55:32.820 --> 01:55:34.440]
The best Chinese buffet in South Florida.

[01:55:34.820 --> 01:55:36.100]
And they got three locations for you.

[01:55:36.540 --> 01:55:38.320]
Sunrise, Pember Pines, and Sunny Oles Beach.

[01:55:38.780 --> 01:55:40.940]
In fact, Gov and I talked to my good friend Richard at the Emerald Coast.

[01:55:41.140 --> 01:55:44.200]
He's just as proud as I am that the least lost no playout games this season.

[01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:46.800]
Over a hundred different items featured on the Emerald Coast buffet.

[01:55:46.940 --> 01:55:47.920]
So we shouldn't try them all.

[01:55:48.100 --> 01:55:49.620]
Start out with six gourmet soups.

[01:55:49.620 --> 01:55:53.220]
Then go for a delicious juicy New York steak grill order just the way you love it.

[01:55:53.420 --> 01:55:54.100]
Hand-carb primary.

[01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:58.220]
There's a sushi bar and all the traditional Asian dishes as well as a salad and shrimp bar.

[01:55:58.340 --> 01:55:59.640]
I have salad and...

[01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:00.500]
See, a bar.

[01:56:00.940 --> 01:56:03.720]
Boy, you've been long vacation since you've been able to do that last.

[01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:04.120]

[01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:05.600]
You will know what to eat next at the Emerald Coast.

[01:56:06.040 --> 01:56:09.360]
And at a zird bar, a spectacular during the week, but on the weekends, even better because

[01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:14.420]
the 40-inch chocolate bun will make your mouth water as you hand it to your strawberries, marshmallows, cheesecake,

[01:56:15.020 --> 01:56:17.200]
other deconent treats and loads of milk chocolate for dessert.

[01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:19.860]
A perfect ending to a gigantic feast at the Emerald Coast.

[01:56:19.960 --> 01:56:24.700]
And don't forget, no MSG, no cornstarch, no crap, it was only healthy, cholesterol, fecinal oil,

[01:56:24.860 --> 01:56:26.480]
even a lielalic would be proud.

[01:56:26.940 --> 01:56:35.820]
So bring the whole family to the Emerald Coast today called 9-5-4-572-38-22 for reservations 9-5-4-572-38-22.

[01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:38.680]
The Emerald Coast Chinese buffet, and don't forget to be prided through Sunday.

[01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:43.240]
It's locked to your fest at the Emerald Coast where you can eat your hearts content without spending a lot of green.

[01:56:43.940 --> 01:56:46.040]
This is meal Roger.

[01:56:46.300 --> 01:56:49.960]
Oh my, this is 5.62.8.

[01:56:50.260 --> 01:56:50.260]

[01:56:51.780 --> 01:56:53.040]
Now what the hell was that?

[01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:54.420]
I don't know, was it a redroin?

[01:56:54.920 --> 01:56:55.140]
Yeah.

[01:56:55.280 --> 01:56:58.060]
That counted suspiciously like a one-door sneaky redroin to me.

[01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:00.540]
Floridians, dumb ass jerks!

[01:57:00.940 --> 01:57:01.340]
Hello.

[01:57:02.040 --> 01:57:03.480]
I'm Joyce Beans.

[01:57:03.860 --> 01:57:06.080]
We so rebutto do this sterilism.

[01:57:07.320 --> 01:57:08.460]
Do I smell all right?

[01:57:09.020 --> 01:57:09.540]
Let me check.

[01:57:10.540 --> 01:57:12.860]
Hmm, because I refuse to dream.

[01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:14.600]
I like crunchy cake.

[01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:16.020]
Excuse me a moment.

[01:57:17.500 --> 01:57:22.440]
Yes, I smell adequate today, not quite up to the German chocolate cake level,

[01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:27.520]
but when the carpet doesn't match the drapes, I'm satisfied with a coconut cream texture.

[01:57:28.120 --> 01:57:30.180]
I insist on big crunchy cake.

[01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:33.800]
Yes, how I'm fine.

[01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:40.920]
Now, I'm here to state my rationale for not allowing fart sounds on the meal Roger's show.

[01:57:41.860 --> 01:57:45.840]
Not only are farts disgusting, but not necessary.

[01:57:46.300 --> 01:57:50.720]
Bottley gas can easily be controlled with self-discipline, taste and point.

[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:56.800]
I had coleslaw for lunch, and see, there is absolutely nothing coming.

[01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:03.140]
The noise that is.

[01:58:06.900 --> 01:58:14.700]
I mean, if I can...

[01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:19.240]
With a little self-conscious.

[01:58:19.980 --> 01:58:20.380]
No.

[01:58:26.260 --> 01:58:27.960]
And you didn't hear a thing.

[01:58:32.580 --> 01:58:34.420]
That's why I voted for Edward Muskie.

[01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:38.540]
I told you she never farted, didn't I?

[01:58:39.300 --> 01:58:40.080]
She never did.

[01:58:40.600 --> 01:58:41.620]
That Joyce Beans bitch.

[01:58:42.120 --> 01:58:45.860]
1,500 on a pole with that, and Lusting Pit, that score thing back up on top of the screen.

[01:58:45.860 --> 01:58:47.060]
And by the way, Josh is right.

[01:58:47.400 --> 01:58:49.460]
Dave O'Brien is doing the games on ABC.

[01:58:50.220 --> 01:58:50.840]
How embarrassing.

[01:58:51.580 --> 01:58:52.700]
What are you talking about?

[01:58:53.020 --> 01:58:54.240]
The soccer games, the World Cup.

[01:58:54.540 --> 01:58:54.920]
No way.

[01:58:55.440 --> 01:59:00.500]
I thought you were the guy that told me that there was that facts who told him he was an idiot because there was a baseball game going on on ABC.

[01:59:00.500 --> 01:59:02.660]
No, no, it's Dave O'Brien is doing the soccer on ABC.

[01:59:02.960 --> 01:59:03.720]
I'm telling you that right now.

[01:59:03.740 --> 01:59:04.520]
I heard a little bit of it.

[01:59:04.640 --> 01:59:05.040]
That's true.

[01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:05.580]
Yeah.

[01:59:06.060 --> 01:59:07.420]
Why did he just believe that?

[01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:12.460]
Well, because when the guy fact stood in last week, it was wrong.

[01:59:12.460 --> 01:59:13.940]
He was calling a baseball game.

[01:59:13.940 --> 01:59:18.080]
So I'm telling you right now, man, in fact, is this thing on ABC?

[01:59:18.460 --> 01:59:19.400]
Let me just take a few credits.

[01:59:19.660 --> 01:59:21.320]
See, it must be, when you think.

[01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:24.200]
And how they got an infomercial on my ABC affiliate here.

[01:59:24.320 --> 01:59:25.100]
Why the hell would that be?

[01:59:25.660 --> 01:59:25.720]
Huh?

[01:59:26.160 --> 01:59:28.640]
Oh, and then there's that awful family feud with a guy with a beard.

[01:59:30.640 --> 01:59:31.480]
What's that guy's name?

[01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:32.100]
That's the guy's name.

[01:59:32.760 --> 01:59:33.460]
Oh, my God.

[01:59:33.560 --> 01:59:34.320]
He's just horrible.

[01:59:34.620 --> 01:59:35.560]
You know the one I'm talking about?

[01:59:35.700 --> 01:59:37.580]
Family feud that's not anymore.

[01:59:38.140 --> 01:59:38.460]
Yeah.

[01:59:38.840 --> 01:59:39.400]
In fact, he's...

[01:59:39.400 --> 01:59:39.940]
Louis Anderson.

[01:59:40.300 --> 01:59:43.160]
No, Louis B. Anderson was even not as bad as this guy.

[01:59:43.160 --> 01:59:44.820]
It's still 2-0, Brazil.

[01:59:45.260 --> 01:59:46.460]
And he played 76 and a half minutes.

[01:59:46.760 --> 01:59:47.940]
The guy from Home Improvement.

[01:59:48.220 --> 01:59:48.680]
Oh, that guy.

[01:59:48.860 --> 01:59:49.380]
I don't know his name.

[01:59:49.580 --> 01:59:50.660]
He's on Home Improvement?

[01:59:50.960 --> 01:59:51.540]
Not anymore.

[01:59:51.760 --> 01:59:52.420]
He doesn't show that.

[01:59:52.720 --> 01:59:52.800]
That's true.

[01:59:52.980 --> 01:59:54.240]
What are all these...

[01:59:54.760 --> 01:59:57.720]
Who wants to see somebody read modeling a house?

[01:59:57.880 --> 01:59:58.820]
What kind of a show is that?

[01:59:59.480 --> 02:00:01.100]
All the so-called reality TV.

[02:00:01.340 --> 02:00:02.660]
It's just a treasure hunt.

[02:00:02.660 --> 02:00:03.540]
Do you see that one now?

[02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:04.060]
No.

[02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:05.420]
Haven't even seen the promo.

[02:00:05.520 --> 02:00:05.860]
Oh, yeah.

[02:00:05.860 --> 02:00:06.680]
I've seen the promo score.

[02:00:06.880 --> 02:00:07.400]
Oh, give me a...

[02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:08.380]
I'm not talking about the show.

[02:00:08.500 --> 02:00:09.680]
You think I would watch anyone show?

[02:00:10.160 --> 02:00:11.240]
What garbage, man.

[02:00:12.140 --> 02:00:14.720]
Postures that the right-wing free republic message board.

[02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:17.220]
And of course, you know that Net job website free republic.

[02:00:17.700 --> 02:00:20.060]
Postures that the right-wing free republic message board today

[02:00:20.060 --> 02:00:22.720]
were roused into a fury of indignation by a new story

[02:00:22.720 --> 02:00:25.400]
about New York Times revelations of the administrative legal programs

[02:00:25.400 --> 02:00:26.580]
of warrantless surveillance.

[02:00:27.140 --> 02:00:29.820]
Posted by an individual calling himself or herself a peasant.

[02:00:30.260 --> 02:00:32.060]
Oh, I can't say the way that...

[02:00:32.060 --> 02:00:33.040]
That's not how you say it.

[02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:34.380]
These stories...

[02:00:34.380 --> 02:00:35.020]
That's cute.

[02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:37.060]
The story quoted Dick Cheney as saying.

[02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:38.360]
Can I say that?

[02:00:38.740 --> 02:00:38.920]
And?

[02:00:39.200 --> 02:00:39.780]
I can say, and.

[02:00:39.780 --> 02:00:42.860]
The New York Times had out twice two separate occasions

[02:00:42.860 --> 02:00:43.660]
to disclose programs.

[02:00:43.660 --> 02:00:46.160]
Both times they had been asked not to publish those stories

[02:00:46.160 --> 02:00:47.520]
by senior administration officials.

[02:00:47.520 --> 02:00:48.720]
They went ahead anyway.

[02:00:49.020 --> 02:00:51.060]
The least in the New York Times and the publishing of these leaks

[02:00:51.060 --> 02:00:51.820]
is very damaging.

[02:00:52.160 --> 02:00:54.000]
I guess they're not so considered by Dick Cheney and the leak

[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.860]
of Valerie Plains' identity of a covert CIA operative

[02:00:56.860 --> 02:01:00.160]
and which jeopardized all of our operations, et cetera.

[02:01:00.700 --> 02:01:02.740]
And her life and lives a lot of other CIA agents.

[02:01:03.780 --> 02:01:05.820]
The thread which followed this provocative statement

[02:01:05.820 --> 02:01:07.740]
was almost entirely devoted to imagining

[02:01:07.740 --> 02:01:09.980]
every more extreme ways to get back at the times

[02:01:09.980 --> 02:01:12.960]
for what the posters widely considered to be an act of treason.

[02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:16.380]
The recommended responses started out with a relatively mild and legal

[02:01:16.380 --> 02:01:19.320]
sickly AG on the NYT, the Attorney General.

[02:01:19.720 --> 02:01:22.080]
Can we have a class action lawsuit against the slimes

[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:23.340]
for endagering American lives?

[02:01:23.720 --> 02:01:25.740]
However, they soon became increasingly vindictive.

[02:01:25.980 --> 02:01:28.300]
Whoever it is needs to spend the rest of his pathetic life

[02:01:28.300 --> 02:01:28.980]
in the slammer.

[02:01:29.520 --> 02:01:31.740]
In-dipement to resident imprisonments are very much in order here.

[02:01:31.880 --> 02:01:33.540]
Not to put too fine a point on it,

[02:01:33.560 --> 02:01:35.760]
but just how much treason is our prison prepared to tolerate.

[02:01:35.760 --> 02:01:38.220]
The thread quickly took on the quality of a lynch mob

[02:01:38.220 --> 02:01:40.220]
when posters attempting to wipe to one another

[02:01:40.220 --> 02:01:41.740]
in the level of their imaginary violence.

[02:01:42.140 --> 02:01:44.460]
I can only hope I get to see the video of Salzburgers

[02:01:44.460 --> 02:01:44.960]
be hitting.

[02:01:45.500 --> 02:01:47.780]
If the government will not perhaps some private citizens will.

[02:01:48.140 --> 02:01:50.780]
Tarr and feathers, you are the very definition of the term restraint.

[02:01:51.080 --> 02:01:53.140]
I was thinking more along the lines of Muslim solution.

[02:01:53.580 --> 02:01:55.760]
String them up right next to a Muthas sad carcass.

[02:01:56.160 --> 02:01:56.820]
And now no, no, no, what?

[02:01:56.960 --> 02:01:57.500]
How do you like that?

[02:01:57.960 --> 02:01:58.320]
Nicely.

[02:01:59.440 --> 02:02:00.000]
So there you go.

[02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:02.140]
These are the Afree Republic dot com crowd.

[02:02:02.460 --> 02:02:03.880]
Right when Greenberg repulsed us.

[02:02:03.880 --> 02:02:04.780]
Yeah, Free Republic.

[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:05.440]
That's them.

[02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:08.480]
In other words, that's the acronym form.

[02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:09.320]
Like that.

[02:02:09.740 --> 02:02:11.660]
Fashionable votes on the pool still 2-0.

[02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:13.460]
And they played almost 80 minutes in the World Cup.

[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:17.660]
And a strongly worded headline that appeared across a variety of news websites.

[02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:21.620]
The Associated Press is formally accused president Bush of ignoring laws that he signs.

[02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:24.120]
The AP headline at ABC News.

[02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:26.680]
Bush ignores laws he angst vexing Congress.

[02:02:26.900 --> 02:02:29.400]
At AOL Bush ignores laws he signs vexing Congress.

[02:02:29.800 --> 02:02:30.100]
And Yahoo!

[02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:32.880]
Bush ignores laws he angst vexing Congress.

[02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:36.380]
Sounds like Congress is getting pretty vexed and reflects the vexing.

[02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:37.980]
Republican Senator Dishy.

[02:02:38.040 --> 02:02:38.580]
And now what's that word?

[02:02:38.700 --> 02:02:39.060]
Pissant?

[02:02:39.340 --> 02:02:39.780]
On what?

[02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:40.540]
On it.

[02:02:41.060 --> 02:02:44.900]
Republican Senator Judiciary Committee, Arlen Spector is counting the administration when he believes

[02:02:44.900 --> 02:02:47.160]
is an excessive interpretation of presidential powers.

[02:02:47.860 --> 02:02:51.880]
A law is not binding when a president issues a separate statement saying he reserves the right to revise

[02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:55.300]
interpreter this regarding our national security and constitutional grounds.

[02:02:55.660 --> 02:02:58.160]
That's the argument of Bush administration officials are expected to make today.

[02:02:58.160 --> 02:03:01.240]
He said he for the Senate Judiciary Committee chaired by Arlen Spector,

[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:05.940]
who was demanded a hearing on a practice he considers an example of the administration's abuse of power.

[02:03:06.460 --> 02:03:10.060]
It's a challenge to the plain language of the Constitution Spector said the AP.

[02:03:10.460 --> 02:03:15.300]
I'm interested to hear from the administration just what research they've done to leave them to the conclusion they can cherry pick.

[02:03:15.720 --> 02:03:19.280]
Apparently enough to challenge many more statutes passed by Congress than any other president.

[02:03:19.620 --> 02:03:20.540]
Spector's Committee says.

[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:24.780]
The White House doesn't dispute that, but notes that Bush is hardly the first chief executive to issue with them.

[02:03:24.780 --> 02:03:29.720]
Signing statements have long been issued by presidents dating back to Andrew Jackson all the way through president Clinton,

[02:03:29.780 --> 02:03:32.120]
White House spokesman, woman Dana Perrano, said yes.

[02:03:32.200 --> 02:03:36.060]
And again, I wonder if she's related to Marty Perrano, left handed voter from Syracuse.

[02:03:36.500 --> 02:03:37.040]
You think?

[02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:37.540]
Who?

[02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:40.520]
As there's 18 votes on the poll about soccer, baby.

[02:03:40.900 --> 02:03:43.220]
We got this big world cup game going in, you're poo-pooing it.

[02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:44.980]
Just like Joyce, there was poo in here.

[02:03:45.140 --> 02:03:47.020]
I think she did three pooes there at the end of that bit.

[02:03:47.500 --> 02:03:48.780]
She was really old poo-pooing.

[02:03:49.160 --> 02:03:51.820]
Another of the less counterways that you poo on us, Joyce.

[02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:52.940]
I would say.

[02:03:52.940 --> 02:03:54.040]
But third, man.

[02:03:54.720 --> 02:03:56.480]
Okay, let's crank up some of these calls now.

[02:03:57.580 --> 02:03:57.920]
56670560.

[02:03:58.220 --> 02:03:58.560]
What do you think?

[02:03:59.120 --> 02:03:59.460]
Do it.

[02:03:59.460 --> 02:04:29.180]
56650560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560

[02:04:30.340 --> 02:04:35.920]
I know you are pooing them, I just don't understand you.

[02:04:35.920 --> 02:04:40.580]
You are pooing the crowd is booing and you are pooing and of course you are using it.

[02:04:40.720 --> 02:04:42.380]
You can understand what the crowd is booing at.

[02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:50.300]
You can't say they are right, you are mama.

[02:04:50.580 --> 02:04:51.040]
I do not like that.

[02:04:51.220 --> 02:04:54.020]
You always take that and put it in your pipe and let your it smoke it.

[02:04:54.780 --> 02:04:59.580]
82 minutes and 10 seconds gone by and the gononies men had some excellent scoring chances.

[02:05:00.020 --> 02:05:05.080]
But every time they get near that Brazil goal for some strange reason they kick it very high and very wide.

[02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:05.420]
You know?

[02:05:05.800 --> 02:05:10.820]
Look at the guy in hockey gets a penalty shot and he goes in all alone and he shoots it like 15 feet wider than that.

[02:05:10.920 --> 02:05:14.100]
If there is something really I don't know, really stinko about that whole deal.

[02:05:14.960 --> 02:05:20.420]
Finally a TV experience like no other Comcast digital cable with on the man is easy to use.

[02:05:20.420 --> 02:05:22.760]
And what do you think you are controlled or whole new level?

This is Neil Rogers. This is 516 QAAs.

[02:06:34.340 --> 02:06:40.500]
But if a redroin is going to be redroin one time and it's going to be like in the middle of a break, it doesn't work for me.

[02:06:40.660 --> 02:06:44.060]
Okay, I don't want to like type what's boss to you, but it just doesn't work for me.

[02:06:44.060 --> 02:06:49.020]
Well, I wish I could say it didn't nail me a few times last week and yesterday that doesn't work.

[02:06:49.360 --> 02:06:53.040]
Okay, so whoever is making up his log and I use the term very loosely Christian.

[02:06:53.340 --> 02:06:58.480]
I mean, how can we have like all three and a half informative breaks all day and then like the second break in the next hour is a 90 second break.

[02:06:58.660 --> 02:07:03.380]
This is a individual even though you highly touted him when he first showed up on a scene.

[02:07:03.800 --> 02:07:07.400]
He would know a log from a log cabin. He would know Abe Lincoln if he saw him.

[02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:08.320]
I said it was a nice guy.

[02:07:08.700 --> 02:07:10.900]
Oh, he's a nice guy, but it is usual nice guys.

[02:07:10.900 --> 02:07:11.360]
I wish.

[02:07:13.120 --> 02:07:18.820]
And with Christian, he's got his fame.

[02:07:19.940 --> 02:07:24.280]
He says a day but what if things got to be okay?

[02:07:25.940 --> 02:07:29.700]
You and the other way and what if you say?

[02:07:31.020 --> 02:07:35.100]
If we end up with him, you might have a day.

[02:07:35.100 --> 02:07:45.100]
If you were to live with him, you might not be staying with him.

[02:07:46.280 --> 02:07:50.560]
You better stay with him, you know.

[02:07:52.540 --> 02:07:57.560]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, what if things don't go that way?

[02:07:58.740 --> 02:08:03.400]
You said what if he was the other way?

[02:08:05.440 --> 02:08:05.880]
Yeah.

[02:08:05.880 --> 02:08:08.660]
What if God didn't know what would be?

[02:08:09.860 --> 02:08:11.380]
I feel better, sir.

[02:08:18.740 --> 02:08:20.080]
1247, 13 to 11.

[02:08:20.720 --> 02:08:23.960]
And the only thing I need over till it's over is all over that big stopper magic.

[02:08:23.960 --> 02:08:24.860]
We're so whipped up about.

[02:08:24.960 --> 02:08:28.740]
I mean, not technically over, but it's over because Brazil scored again.

[02:08:29.760 --> 02:08:30.200]
Yeah.

[02:08:30.940 --> 02:08:36.100]
And finally, they got a shot there, the gun on ease, but the goalie stopped it.

[02:08:36.260 --> 02:08:39.060]
And they're like a minute to go and then they'll have a little extra time.

[02:08:39.160 --> 02:08:39.620]
And bye bye.

[02:08:39.800 --> 02:08:42.040]
It's 3-Zep, 3-Nil for Brazil.

[02:08:42.720 --> 02:08:44.180]
So I see enough of that crap, okay?

[02:08:44.640 --> 02:08:45.120]
Turn it off.

[02:08:45.380 --> 02:08:45.620]
I did.

[02:08:46.340 --> 02:08:50.640]
7 men charged with conspiring to bomb the Sears Tower in Chicago and the FBI building in Miami.

[02:08:51.060 --> 02:08:54.360]
We're trapped by a federal informant, lawyers for two of the suspects that yesterday.

[02:08:54.960 --> 02:08:58.280]
And in that condition, last week accused the men of pledging loyalty to us, some of it,

[02:08:58.280 --> 02:09:02.040]
and Laudanse Alcada, and seeking the roof support to wage war against the US government.

[02:09:02.420 --> 02:09:06.200]
The person they thought was an Alcada representative was actually an FBI informant to us,

[02:09:06.280 --> 02:09:07.180]
just as the department would be saying.

[02:09:08.080 --> 02:09:11.900]
Albert Levin, the court of put an attorney for suspect Patrick Abraham,

[02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:14.540]
city believes his client was ensnared by the informant.

[02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:17.940]
There was a lot of talking going on by the informant, and more listening by the defendant,

[02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:23.360]
and or the defendant, so I've been told Fox News Channel host Bill O'Reilly, the Oceans Bill O'Reilly.

[02:09:23.760 --> 02:09:24.860]
That's how I run that country.

[02:09:25.260 --> 02:09:28.680]
Nathan Clark, let's send him there. Let's send his ass to a racquetlet him runner.

[02:09:28.800 --> 02:09:32.400]
What are you saying? All right. Bring all the troops home and send Bill O'Reilly over there.

[02:09:32.460 --> 02:09:33.620]
Sure, he can do it by phone.

[02:09:34.240 --> 02:09:37.440]
Nathan Clark, a lawyer for another suspect, Rothschild Augustine agreed.

[02:09:37.840 --> 02:09:44.820]
With respect to my client from what I can read in the indictment, there's going to be a question of whether there's even sufficient evidence to sustain the burden of proof on conviction Clark said.

[02:09:45.100 --> 02:09:49.800]
If by any chance there's a centilla of that, then of course there's going to be the entrapment issue we said.

[02:09:49.800 --> 02:09:53.420]
This thing took place over eight months according to the indictment at the end of the indictment.

[02:09:53.420 --> 02:09:57.980]
It says that this thing became disorganized and nobody ever done anything or did anything Clark said.

[02:09:58.360 --> 02:10:00.040]
Nobody had ever done anything or did anything.

[02:10:01.100 --> 02:10:03.180]
Abraham, Augustine, Abraham Martin and John.

[02:10:03.720 --> 02:10:05.920]
Abraham, Augustine and three other men arrested Thursday, Miami,

[02:10:06.040 --> 02:10:08.160]
appeared briefly in a magistrate's court on Friday.

[02:10:08.620 --> 02:10:12.180]
Another suspect arrested in Atlanta made his initial court appearance there on Friday.

[02:10:12.580 --> 02:10:16.240]
These seven suspects arrested in Miami area earlier last week on probation violation,

[02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:18.620]
escaped real appear court, Mannyana.

[02:10:18.720 --> 02:10:19.600]
How do you like that?

[02:10:21.500 --> 02:10:23.600]
Everybody have a nervous breakdown.

[02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:27.640]
Just like Marie Dowts said, these people couldn't find serious departments or much less serious power.

[02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:31.380]
But your slipper is Getski's with bad head gear.

[02:10:31.780 --> 02:10:32.460]
And dirty bad.

[02:10:32.860 --> 02:10:36.940]
Oh my god, bad head gear and bad head, head, head, haircuts.

[02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:39.600]
Thousand and you see how many votes we got over a thousand?

[02:10:39.700 --> 02:10:40.580]
Thirty, man.

[02:10:40.760 --> 02:10:42.160]
Thousand thirty votes on a pool.

[02:10:42.620 --> 02:10:44.320]
They kind of ease back once we got to the thousand.

[02:10:44.320 --> 02:10:45.440]
You know something I don't blame you.

[02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:47.040]
It's hotter and hell it's the middle of the summertime.

[02:10:47.060 --> 02:10:50.660]
We got a lot of pressure with that Brazil match that they just zip right on by there.

[02:10:50.860 --> 02:10:54.920]
I think they were just, they never got out of neutral in that match, you know, against the Japanese.

[02:10:56.020 --> 02:10:57.180]
They didn't even want to embarrass them.

[02:10:57.620 --> 02:11:01.940]
Five, six, seven, oh five, sixty, pound five, sixteen, the Verizon singular wireless line.

[02:11:02.360 --> 02:11:06.300]
Why sure I'm upset that I missed all of that excitement though, from the way you described it.

[02:11:06.380 --> 02:11:06.840]
It wasn't the end.

[02:11:07.620 --> 02:11:08.800]
You know, that'll never happen again.

[02:11:08.940 --> 02:11:10.280]
Well, maybe it wasn't really fake.

[02:11:10.500 --> 02:11:11.260]
I mean, it wasn't been great.

[02:11:11.260 --> 02:11:12.200]
Air sauce.

[02:11:12.980 --> 02:11:14.060]
Somebody QAM, hello.

[02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:15.640]
Yeah.

[02:11:17.240 --> 02:11:17.640]
Yeah.

[02:11:17.660 --> 02:11:17.660]

[02:11:18.700 --> 02:11:19.100]
Okay.

[02:11:20.380 --> 02:11:21.800]
Oh, short and sweet.

[02:11:22.560 --> 02:11:23.500]
Somebody QAM, hello.

[02:11:23.860 --> 02:11:24.600]
I have no man.

[02:11:24.840 --> 02:11:25.380]
Well, okay, good.

[02:11:26.040 --> 02:11:27.020]
Give me Wilma's number.

[02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:27.800]
She'll take care of him.

[02:11:27.900 --> 02:11:28.540]
Go ask Wilma.

[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:31.160]
And last but certainly not least, somebody QAM.

[02:11:31.520 --> 02:11:33.940]
How that was.

[02:11:34.120 --> 02:11:34.680]
You see, I don't know.

[02:11:34.900 --> 02:11:36.640]
That's the ordinary one I get.

[02:11:36.940 --> 02:11:37.160]
Right.

[02:11:37.340 --> 02:11:37.960]
But that's the faker.

[02:11:38.060 --> 02:11:40.540]
Now Gilbert, you started it and did it for a while.

[02:11:40.640 --> 02:11:41.240]
And this guy does it.

[02:11:41.700 --> 02:11:44.880]
And then Gilbert kind of, you know, didn't keep up his pace.

[02:11:45.080 --> 02:11:46.420]
So this guy became the most popular one.

[02:11:46.420 --> 02:11:48.120]
But then we had the worst.

[02:11:48.340 --> 02:11:48.880]
And then Gilbert.

[02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:51.520]
And yet now a third one, a copier of the copier.

[02:11:51.520 --> 02:11:52.280]
Oh, my God.

[02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:54.220]
A copier of a copicat.

[02:11:54.780 --> 02:11:56.620]
Who's really trying to say, I have no life.

[02:11:56.720 --> 02:11:57.240]
Yeah, we understand.

[02:11:57.480 --> 02:11:58.280]
Well, that's all of them.

[02:11:58.600 --> 02:12:01.000]
And of course, you continue doing those appearances because you need the money.

[02:12:01.140 --> 02:12:02.320]
So you get to meet these people.

[02:12:02.520 --> 02:12:03.500]
You know, this crowd.

[02:12:03.700 --> 02:12:04.180]
It's joy.

[02:12:04.760 --> 02:12:06.300]
And they, uh, think forever.

[02:12:06.800 --> 02:12:07.380]
Oh, there they go.

[02:12:07.460 --> 02:12:07.780]
I see them.

[02:12:07.840 --> 02:12:10.580]
Once that seven minute delay case in all of us in the phone, was realistic.

[02:12:10.580 --> 02:12:11.180]
You see that?

[02:12:11.420 --> 02:12:11.900]
I see it.

[02:12:12.040 --> 02:12:12.840]
It's a beautiful thing.

[02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:13.700]
W-Q-Y-M.

[02:12:13.780 --> 02:12:13.900]
Hello.

[02:12:14.600 --> 02:12:15.400]
There's nobody on it.

[02:12:15.500 --> 02:12:16.520]
Absolutely correct, sir.

[02:12:17.100 --> 02:12:17.840]
W-Q-Y-M.

[02:12:17.960 --> 02:12:18.060]
Hello.

[02:12:19.340 --> 02:12:20.040]
Q-Y-M.

[02:12:20.420 --> 02:12:20.780]
Yeah.

[02:12:20.860 --> 02:12:22.040]
Can I speak with Neil Rogers?

[02:12:22.540 --> 02:12:22.900]
Speaking.

[02:12:23.420 --> 02:12:23.800]
Or this guy.

[02:12:24.060 --> 02:12:25.100]
Are we going to A-D-N in Canada?

[02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:25.440]
Yes.

[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:26.740]
Yeah, Neil, how you doing?

[02:12:27.140 --> 02:12:27.360]
Okay.

[02:12:27.940 --> 02:12:29.760]
This is, uh, first time caller.

[02:12:30.300 --> 02:12:30.620]
Okay.

[02:12:30.980 --> 02:12:31.420]
Hey, Julio.

[02:12:31.760 --> 02:12:32.360]
Another Julio.

[02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:32.960]
See.

[02:12:33.780 --> 02:12:37.420]
I was just, uh, dying to the left, to the right, or just station.

[02:12:37.560 --> 02:12:38.340]
What is his guy's name?

[02:12:38.680 --> 02:12:39.000]
Root.

[02:12:40.480 --> 02:12:40.840]
Root.

[02:12:40.960 --> 02:12:41.200]
Root.

[02:12:41.200 --> 02:12:41.860]
Well, what is his problem?

[02:12:42.100 --> 02:12:42.360]
This guy's the guy.

[02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:42.800]
Root him.

[02:12:43.220 --> 02:12:45.080]
He has a position in this guy.

[02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:45.860]
Steve Root him.

[02:12:46.220 --> 02:12:48.420]
Uh, he used to play with a mighty duck's.

[02:12:48.620 --> 02:12:48.800]
Yeah.

[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.460]
I was, uh, I'm, you know, what was he trying to learn the English language?

[02:12:51.620 --> 02:12:53.520]
He was having a lot of problems with him.

[02:12:53.680 --> 02:12:55.860]
Uh, what is the tissue or is it you?

[02:12:56.280 --> 02:12:56.600]
What is it?

[02:12:57.080 --> 02:12:57.440]
Tissue.

[02:12:57.940 --> 02:12:58.300]
Tissue.

[02:12:58.880 --> 02:12:59.240]
Tissue.

[02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:00.200]
That's what you wipe your...

[02:13:00.200 --> 02:13:00.340]
Correct.

[02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:02.560]
And then, you're pressed before you put in me.

[02:13:02.640 --> 02:13:03.160]
Shoot over.

[02:13:03.500 --> 02:13:04.560]
We've all heard this story.

[02:13:04.680 --> 02:13:08.040]
November 2nd, 2004, was shaping up as the day of celebration for Democrats.

[02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:10.480]
That's the exit polls predicting a victory for Senator John Kerry.

[02:13:10.920 --> 02:13:14.300]
Many Americans, including most political observers, sat down to watch the evening television

[02:13:14.300 --> 02:13:16.640]
coverage, convinced that Kerry would be the next president.

[02:13:17.160 --> 02:13:17.640]
Absolutely.

[02:13:18.160 --> 02:13:21.780]
But the council were being reported on TV, more little resemblance to the exit polls

[02:13:21.780 --> 02:13:22.320]
projections.

[02:13:22.820 --> 02:13:25.960]
In key state after state, Tally's different significantly from the projections.

[02:13:26.360 --> 02:13:29.780]
In every case, that's your favorite president, George W. Bush.

[02:13:30.260 --> 02:13:33.960]
nationwide exit polls projected a 51 to 48% Kerry victory.

[02:13:34.280 --> 02:13:37.280]
The mirror image of Bush is 41 to 48% win.

[02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:40.340]
But the exit poll discrepancy is not the only cause for concern.

[02:13:40.600 --> 02:13:44.520]
This article, by the way, from the Boston Globe by Stephen Freeman and Joel Blyphus.

[02:13:44.860 --> 02:13:49.820]
In Ohio, Secretary of State, Canada, Blackwell, the Ohio Code, chairman of the 2004 Bush

[02:13:49.820 --> 02:13:54.020]
Cheney Campaign, borrowed a chapter from Secretary of State, Catherine Harris's Florida 2000

[02:13:54.020 --> 02:13:58.180]
playbook, like Harris, he used the power of his office to affect turnout and toward voters

[02:13:58.180 --> 02:13:59.600]
and heavily democratic areas.

[02:14:00.140 --> 02:14:02.820]
Vote suppression and electoral irregularities in Ohio have been documented.

[02:14:02.820 --> 02:14:06.060]
First, in January 2005, by Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee.

[02:14:06.460 --> 02:14:10.240]
And in June 2005, by the Democratic National Committee, which founded the words of VNC Chairman

[02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:14.520]
Howard Dean, more than a quarter of all Ohio voters reported problems with their voter

[02:14:14.520 --> 02:14:16.620]
inexperience, more than a quarter of all of them.

[02:14:17.140 --> 02:14:21.040]
Election Day 2000 for also Saudi-Eventivate Congressional mandate under the Help America

[02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:24.180]
Vodak to replace punchcard systems with new unproven technologies.

[02:14:24.740 --> 02:14:28.880]
In that election, 64% of Americans voted on direct recorded electronic voting machines,

[02:14:28.880 --> 02:14:33.360]
or optical scan systems, both of which are vulnerable to hacking or programming fraud.

[02:14:33.720 --> 02:14:38.600]
According to a September 2005 GAO Office of Investigation, such systems contain flaws that

[02:14:38.600 --> 02:14:42.480]
could allow unauthorized personnel to disrupt operations or modify data and programs that

[02:14:42.480 --> 02:14:44.540]
are critical to the integrity of the voting process.

[02:14:45.080 --> 02:14:48.900]
A reasonable person could argue that, thus that a well-conducted exit poll that confirmed

[02:14:48.900 --> 02:14:51.980]
the official count would be about the only reason we would have to believe the results

[02:14:51.980 --> 02:14:52.780]
of such an election.

[02:14:53.120 --> 02:14:57.040]
Without an audit or a recount to verify the official count, those of us who suspect that

[02:14:57.040 --> 02:15:00.440]
the presidential election was stolen, do so based on the information now available.

[02:15:00.980 --> 02:15:04.380]
In the days after the election, the media largely ignored this exit poll to discrepancy,

[02:15:04.680 --> 02:15:08.200]
when it was mentioned, it was only to report that the exit poll, based on a confidential

[02:15:08.200 --> 02:15:13.760]
25-question written survey of 114,000-plus voters and 1480 precincts were flawed.

[02:15:14.280 --> 02:15:18.540]
The discrepancy, however, was real and beyond a statistical margin of error on that there

[02:15:18.540 --> 02:15:22.520]
is widespread agreement, while it is still being debated, what is still being debated is

[02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:24.360]
the only reason for that discrepancy.

[02:15:24.360 --> 02:15:29.820]
In January 2005, on the eve of Bush's inauguration, the two men who conducted the 2004 exit

[02:15:29.820 --> 02:15:33.800]
poll, Warren Matowski and Joe Lensky, released their promised explanation.

[02:15:34.160 --> 02:15:37.680]
Their report began, the inaccurate season of the exit poll estimates were not due to

[02:15:37.680 --> 02:15:41.020]
the sample selection of the polling locations at which the exit polls were conducted.

[02:15:41.460 --> 02:15:45.080]
In other words, the precincts they sampled were representative of the nation, so the discrepancy

[02:15:45.080 --> 02:15:47.740]
was not the result of choosing unrepresented precincts.

[02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:52.020]
The data they released allows researchers to correlate voter characteristics, raised

[02:15:52.020 --> 02:15:56.700]
age, sex, etc., with voting preferences, but was not the data that identified specific

[02:15:56.700 --> 02:15:58.740]
exit poll results with specific precincts.

[02:15:59.020 --> 02:16:04.200]
That data remains the property of the median consortium ABC and BC, CBS Fox C and N and

[02:16:04.200 --> 02:16:05.580]
the AP that commissioned the polls.

[02:16:05.960 --> 02:16:09.800]
No one has provided a coherent account of how polling area could explain discrepancy.

[02:16:10.140 --> 02:16:13.900]
We have only the pollster's black assertion that carry voters must have disproportionately

[02:16:13.900 --> 02:16:15.260]
participated in the polls.

[02:16:15.600 --> 02:16:19.480]
Yet the available state-level data contradicts the pollster's explanation, also termed a

[02:16:19.480 --> 02:16:21.140]
reluctant bush-respawn theory.

[02:16:21.440 --> 02:16:25.720]
The data does show the key variables, racial makeup of a state, partisan controller governorship,

[02:16:25.900 --> 02:16:29.540]
whether a state is a swing state, reports of election day complaints, all correlate with

[02:16:29.540 --> 02:16:31.040]
the magnitude of the poll discrepancy.

[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:35.040]
The report also indicated that for rural and small town precincts, the only ones where

[02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:38.500]
a comparable data does exist, the difference between the exit poll results in the official

[02:16:38.500 --> 02:16:43.020]
count is three times greater in precincts where voters use machines than in precincts using

[02:16:43.020 --> 02:16:43.900]
paper ballots alone.

[02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:47.880]
If we had asked this to do with help precinct level data, we'd be able to investigate whether

[02:16:47.880 --> 02:16:51.600]
the size of the data support discrepancy correlates with the voting technology used.

[02:16:51.840 --> 02:16:56.020]
For these reasons and more, it is imperative that our newspapers of record as well as our

[02:16:56.020 --> 02:17:00.380]
governmental oversight bodies now investigate the question people continue to ask was the

[02:17:00.760 --> 02:17:03.360]
2004 election stolen, which is the name of their book by the way.

[02:17:03.640 --> 02:17:05.140]
It feels to apply first and state and free of it.

[02:17:05.300 --> 02:17:05.440]
Freeman.

[02:17:05.940 --> 02:17:07.640]
And we all know the answer the answer is.

[02:17:07.680 --> 02:17:08.000]
Absolutely.

[02:17:08.280 --> 02:17:08.440]
Of course.

[02:17:09.340 --> 02:17:12.060]
I mean, if at first you do succeed, why not do it again, right?

[02:17:12.580 --> 02:17:12.800]
Right.

[02:17:13.400 --> 02:17:16.760]
They got away with it in 2000, the media world over and played dead and spread their legs

[02:17:16.760 --> 02:17:18.220]
and said, hey, why not do it again?

[02:17:18.440 --> 02:17:19.560]
We can and we did and they did.

[02:17:20.580 --> 02:17:25.160]
1257 at 560 over the QM while supplies last at Dalamakras, you can save hundreds of dollars

[02:17:25.160 --> 02:17:25.720]
off a C.V.

[02:17:25.800 --> 02:17:30.000]
Potser-Pedic striker ultra-plusher euro pillow top only from Dalamakras.

[02:17:30.300 --> 02:17:33.460]
For a limited time, take 400 bucks off a queen set, just 699.

[02:17:34.020 --> 02:17:37.640]
Take 550 bucks off a king set, similar savings at all sizes.

[02:17:38.100 --> 02:17:40.600]
Now, this isn't some cheap old macros that other stores promote in their ads.

[02:17:40.980 --> 02:17:42.040]
It's a luxury C.V.

[02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:46.540]
Potser-Pedic complete with memory foam and a premium-croll unit, perfect for the master

[02:17:46.540 --> 02:17:46.860]
bedroom.

[02:17:47.140 --> 02:17:52.300]
It's a special limited time offer, won't last long, so call 1-800-MATTRES right now and

[02:17:52.300 --> 02:17:54.680]
find out more about these striker macros from C.V.

[02:17:54.700 --> 02:17:56.660]
Rask about clearance pricing out of their C.V.

[02:17:56.740 --> 02:17:57.640]
Potser-Pedic as well.

[02:17:58.120 --> 02:18:02.860]
Call 1-800-MATTRES and when you do call, be sure to ask about their 12-month financing

[02:18:02.860 --> 02:18:03.420]
plan too.

[02:18:03.880 --> 02:18:06.700]
Dalamakras still rank number one of the world's customer satisfaction.

[02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:09.960]
I've been using them for years and guarantee you'll be mighted please you call them.

[02:18:10.240 --> 02:18:16.320]
Call 1-800-MATTRES leave off the last S because it stands for Savings and Striker.

[02:18:16.320 --> 02:18:18.740]
This is Neil Roger.

[02:18:20.160 --> 02:18:23.220]
This is 516-Q-A-M.

[02:18:23.960 --> 02:18:31.880]
I guess hate people that use snappy openers for their show segments like that 1-2-hour.

[02:18:34.040 --> 02:18:38.940]
It's the most pulling degree in this whole country.

[02:18:40.200 --> 02:18:44.820]
Now they want to build a beach there, it's like the O.C.

[02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:51.040]
The water may be toxic, but full of dead guys too.

[02:18:52.440 --> 02:18:57.100]
There's filthy, filthy, raw smoothness, surfing and wide sea.

[02:18:57.960 --> 02:19:03.300]
We'll put our board on the subway, maybe in a tent.

[02:19:04.760 --> 02:19:09.340]
I'm wearing hard, I'm wearing tight, and all streets see me.

[02:19:09.420 --> 02:19:15.060]
I'm wearing tight, I'm overland, I'm wearing tight, and they're saying life's a beauty.

[02:19:15.400 --> 02:19:18.320]
I'm wearing tight, and everybody's on surf.

[02:19:20.100 --> 02:19:21.060]
I'm surfing and wide sea.

[02:19:22.620 --> 02:19:24.160]
Everybody on surf.

[02:19:25.540 --> 02:19:28.680]
Guess what color is back in Prolo's macho or young guys?

[02:19:28.900 --> 02:19:29.580]
Never guess.

[02:19:29.760 --> 02:19:30.920]
No, I don't know, pink.

[02:19:31.340 --> 02:19:32.720]
Yeah, what's that all about?

[02:19:33.040 --> 02:19:39.900]
It's not, it's just that, you know, a bunch of fags have decided that it's okay to welcome Vince other people to wear it now.

[02:19:40.060 --> 02:19:44.000]
Well, I sure got him convinced because I was watching the NHL draft, and I get all these scrapping things.

[02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:45.320]
No, no spray people are wearing it.

[02:19:45.660 --> 02:19:47.480]
That is not hockey players, man.

[02:19:47.860 --> 02:19:48.440]
Like us.

[02:19:48.680 --> 02:19:51.200]
Youngstar hockey players, are you suggesting that they're gay?

[02:19:51.200 --> 02:19:51.460]
Huh?

[02:19:51.680 --> 02:19:51.800]
Yes.

[02:19:52.120 --> 02:19:52.620]
Oh, okay.

[02:19:52.920 --> 02:19:54.420]
Well, geez, that's encouraging.

[02:19:54.800 --> 02:19:57.700]
For me, 150 votes on a poll so far.

[02:19:57.820 --> 02:19:58.780]
What about that soccer thing?

[02:19:58.940 --> 02:20:00.220]
I'm pretty sure that's the final score.

[02:20:00.380 --> 02:20:02.820]
I'm not going to turn back on here because we got this very big story.

[02:20:02.940 --> 02:20:07.180]
Two-story motel, partially collapsed after explosion, and some bum forked town in Georgia.

[02:20:07.720 --> 02:20:08.400]
Aren't you worried about that?

[02:20:08.780 --> 02:20:08.900]
No.

[02:20:09.400 --> 02:20:09.520]
No.

[02:20:09.800 --> 02:20:10.980]
150 votes on a poll.

[02:20:11.100 --> 02:20:12.120]
What's your take on a world couple?

[02:20:12.240 --> 02:20:13.980]
A Copa del Vida, la Copa del Llamundo.

[02:20:14.680 --> 02:20:16.080]
Soccer is so boring.

[02:20:16.260 --> 02:20:16.500]
Amen.

[02:20:16.840 --> 02:20:17.480]
God Almighty.

[02:20:17.740 --> 02:20:19.380]
Oh, 359 votes.

[02:20:19.880 --> 02:20:20.880]
Excuse me, 390.

[02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:21.980]
Where did I get the 59 from?

[02:20:22.580 --> 02:20:24.020]
Am I starting to get like dyslexic now?

[02:20:24.240 --> 02:20:24.420]
Maybe.

[02:20:24.520 --> 02:20:24.840]
390.

[02:20:24.980 --> 02:20:25.060]
More.

[02:20:25.620 --> 02:20:27.260]
Moderally interested, 282.

[02:20:27.860 --> 02:20:28.560]
I love it.

[02:20:28.660 --> 02:20:31.100]
Watching it on TV and holding the Gonstadale, 211.

[02:20:31.280 --> 02:20:32.160]
So you add those two together.

[02:20:32.280 --> 02:20:34.320]
You have about 47% of this audience.

[02:20:34.660 --> 02:20:35.260]
Almost half.

[02:20:35.800 --> 02:20:36.860]
Let's have a soccer show.

[02:20:36.960 --> 02:20:38.480]
Let's get rid of that Ira Windbag.

[02:20:38.800 --> 02:20:40.060]
You get some soccer talk on her.

[02:20:40.120 --> 02:20:40.500]
What do you say?

[02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:41.240]
Do it.

[02:20:41.440 --> 02:20:42.300]
I'm sure you're not doing much.

[02:20:42.680 --> 02:20:43.060]
Who, Ira?

[02:20:43.440 --> 02:20:43.540]
Yeah.

[02:20:44.020 --> 02:20:45.100]
Get rid of his ass.

[02:20:45.200 --> 02:20:45.760]
Man, he's killing.

[02:20:45.900 --> 02:20:47.240]
Ira, you're killing us, man.

[02:20:47.340 --> 02:20:47.940]
You're killing us.

[02:20:47.940 --> 02:20:49.860]
We need you like a locking cup.

[02:20:50.300 --> 02:20:52.080]
What's the World Cup speaking of cup?

[02:20:52.600 --> 02:20:52.960]
79.

[02:20:53.560 --> 02:20:56.480]
As boring as watching any other sport, that was Georgia Choice 57.

[02:20:56.680 --> 02:20:59.080]
When you got some company out there, all these knee-series.

[02:20:59.140 --> 02:21:01.140]
Oh, you're watching ball games well too bad.

[02:21:01.320 --> 02:21:01.440]
They.

[02:21:01.900 --> 02:21:03.660]
I hate this pool only 33.

[02:21:03.880 --> 02:21:04.640]
3.1%.

[02:21:04.640 --> 02:21:06.020]
That's pretty low for I hate this pool.

[02:21:06.440 --> 02:21:06.780]
They love it.

[02:21:07.200 --> 02:21:08.040]
See, they like my pool.

[02:21:08.420 --> 02:21:10.780]
Now, let me ask you again, because do we even have a link?

[02:21:10.920 --> 02:21:11.740]
Let me go to our homepage.

[02:21:11.920 --> 02:21:14.580]
I don't think we do, which I'm a little bit concerned about that.

[02:21:15.040 --> 02:21:16.940]
Do we not want to have a link to this MySpace.com?

[02:21:18.040 --> 02:21:19.560]
Forward slash kneel god thing?

[02:21:19.700 --> 02:21:21.400]
Oh, we haven't gotten that far yet.

[02:21:21.560 --> 02:21:22.640]
But I think it's a good idea.

[02:21:22.640 --> 02:21:23.420]
What do you mean yes?

[02:21:23.740 --> 02:21:24.760]
When did this thing go up there?

[02:21:25.240 --> 02:21:26.580]
Like last week sometime.

[02:21:27.240 --> 02:21:27.460]
Yeah.

[02:21:27.560 --> 02:21:30.700]
It's really taken off much faster than anybody anticipated.

[02:21:31.040 --> 02:21:32.040]
Well, we missed taking off.

[02:21:32.040 --> 02:21:33.800]
We got 103 friends on here.

[02:21:33.860 --> 02:21:34.060]
I know.

[02:21:34.220 --> 02:21:36.480]
I mentioned it like twice, maybe three times.

[02:21:36.600 --> 02:21:37.700]
And then boom.

[02:21:37.880 --> 02:21:39.840]
And then I mentioned it once more after that.

[02:21:39.860 --> 02:21:41.340]
Well, let's see how many of our friends we got now.

[02:21:41.760 --> 02:21:43.900]
No, I think we absolutely should cross-link.

[02:21:44.160 --> 02:21:44.160]

[02:21:44.420 --> 02:21:45.520]
Oh, we got 112 friends.

[02:21:45.520 --> 02:21:49.000]
I'll just thought it would be a good idea to make sure that you were down with it before we did anything with that.

[02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.880]
What the hell do I care, as long as I don't have some stupid chat room on there,

[02:21:51.920 --> 02:21:56.440]
so people can use our space, my space, and your space, and us's space,

[02:21:56.740 --> 02:21:58.640]
to like shout out to each other and write a bunch of crap.

[02:21:58.900 --> 02:22:01.440]
Nevertheless, it's your face, and you're on your space.

[02:22:01.660 --> 02:22:02.080]
And we don't have to write a lot of things on there.

[02:22:02.440 --> 02:22:04.040]
So we wanted to make sure that you had your approval.

[02:22:04.140 --> 02:22:06.460]
I guess we're not doing that hot couples contest this summer, huh?

[02:22:06.720 --> 02:22:08.960]
We might. We actually been talking about the post-ability.

[02:22:09.320 --> 02:22:09.660]
Well, why not?

[02:22:09.980 --> 02:22:11.680]
You can put some tasteful pictures on there.

[02:22:11.920 --> 02:22:13.600]
I want to put some distasteful pictures on there.

[02:22:13.600 --> 02:22:15.260]
Well, we can't do that. You know that.

[02:22:16.160 --> 02:22:17.280]
We can't do that.

[02:22:17.480 --> 02:22:18.260]
We'll get ID.

[02:22:19.700 --> 02:22:21.960]
Yeah. You go, oh, no comment.

[02:22:22.540 --> 02:22:25.060]
I'm sure you'd volunteer to go house to house and check certain IDs.

[02:22:25.300 --> 02:22:27.660]
That's right. And maybe I would too, but I doubt it.

[02:22:27.760 --> 02:22:28.660]
I really doubt it.

[02:22:28.700 --> 02:22:29.680]
I'll give all the girls a physical.

[02:22:30.140 --> 02:22:31.240]
Yeah, I'm sure you'll like.

[02:22:32.160 --> 02:22:34.480]
So let's see. We got all this Godfather stuff on there.

[02:22:34.520 --> 02:22:35.760]
It's pretty nifty. It looks pretty good.

[02:22:35.760 --> 02:22:36.980]
A bunch of good stuff.

[02:22:37.640 --> 02:22:39.380]
And Miguel really is that's good.

[02:22:39.640 --> 02:22:41.500]
Especially if he stiffs us on that fundraiser.

[02:22:41.600 --> 02:22:43.040]
It's about time we did something with it.

[02:22:43.800 --> 02:22:46.180]
And that broke ass mountain too. That's kind of cute.

[02:22:46.300 --> 02:22:48.100]
Uh-huh. The dike thing. That's great.

[02:22:48.820 --> 02:22:49.680]
What else we got?

[02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:51.560]
I don't even know who that is.

[02:22:51.980 --> 02:22:52.140]
Who?

[02:22:52.520 --> 02:22:55.140]
Who's sitting there with some blinded is life? Who is that?

[02:22:55.720 --> 02:22:56.300]
That's George.

[02:22:56.800 --> 02:22:57.440]
That's George?

[02:22:57.880 --> 02:22:58.060]
Yeah.

[02:22:58.660 --> 02:23:00.240]
George has got to tongue that long.

[02:23:00.720 --> 02:23:01.960]
Oh, that explains a lot of things.

[02:23:02.200 --> 02:23:02.300]
Yeah.

[02:23:03.100 --> 02:23:03.860]
That's George.

[02:23:04.220 --> 02:23:05.680]
God compensated for all my effort.

[02:23:05.680 --> 02:23:07.200]
I realize I haven't seen you in a little bit.

[02:23:07.280 --> 02:23:09.820]
Oh, my God. You look like a little picture too.

[02:23:09.940 --> 02:23:10.200]
Oh, no.

[02:23:10.560 --> 02:23:11.400]
Look like hell on wheels.

[02:23:11.400 --> 02:23:13.200]
And the G. Who is that?

[02:23:13.340 --> 02:23:13.780]
Not a remember.

[02:23:14.200 --> 02:23:14.600]
That of course.

[02:23:15.640 --> 02:23:15.640]

[02:23:16.560 --> 02:23:17.280]
That's Samson.

[02:23:17.720 --> 02:23:18.580]
Oh, I remember that.

[02:23:19.180 --> 02:23:20.360]
And then SUDs is there.

[02:23:20.460 --> 02:23:22.260]
It looks like about not a day over 90.

[02:23:22.640 --> 02:23:24.020]
Remember, he just two years younger than you.

[02:23:24.740 --> 02:23:25.700]
Old. Right.

[02:23:26.200 --> 02:23:26.980]
Oh, and you know something?

[02:23:27.440 --> 02:23:27.800]
Wait a minute.

[02:23:27.920 --> 02:23:29.520]
Where's that John Lennon bit?

[02:23:29.840 --> 02:23:31.680]
Because that's going to fit in for my birthday too.

[02:23:32.280 --> 02:23:32.480]
Dude.

[02:23:32.780 --> 02:23:33.400]
The uh-huh?

[02:23:34.180 --> 02:23:34.660]
Paul McCartney.

[02:23:34.860 --> 02:23:35.820]
What I say, John Lennon?

[02:23:35.920 --> 02:23:36.540]
Well, he's aging.

[02:23:36.820 --> 02:23:37.840]
He's not aging well.

[02:23:38.640 --> 02:23:40.220]
Yeah, why didn't they get Paul McCartney instead?

[02:23:40.700 --> 02:23:42.240]
No, no, and I see now he's.

[02:23:42.540 --> 02:23:43.260]
It's a P.J. here.

[02:23:43.640 --> 02:23:44.040]
That's right.

[02:23:46.040 --> 02:23:47.240]
We're not going to play the whole thing.

[02:23:47.920 --> 02:23:50.460]
But now you look old, SUDs.

[02:23:51.060 --> 02:23:52.440]
You look so old, you're the new.

[02:23:53.020 --> 02:23:54.300]
Now you are older.

[02:23:54.720 --> 02:23:55.820]
You still have your hair.

[02:23:56.700 --> 02:23:58.620]
And you're all shy, bro.

[02:23:58.840 --> 02:24:00.760]
Now, you know how it is when you don't see somebody for a long time.

[02:24:00.880 --> 02:24:05.160]
Like a celebrity, which he's kind of like a minor celebrity in his own mind.

[02:24:05.380 --> 02:24:05.460]
Right.

[02:24:05.940 --> 02:24:08.760]
But you don't see somebody for a long time and then you see me, oh my God.

[02:24:08.760 --> 02:24:11.060]
What kind of a train wreck were you in, you know?

[02:24:11.360 --> 02:24:14.280]
Well, his hair wasn't so white last time you saw him.

[02:24:14.480 --> 02:24:14.660]
No.

[02:24:15.120 --> 02:24:15.500]
What hair?

[02:24:16.260 --> 02:24:17.840]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

[02:24:17.840 --> 02:24:18.060]
Oh.

[02:24:18.460 --> 02:24:20.380]
Now, that's not white, it's gray.

[02:24:20.800 --> 02:24:21.080]
Mm-hmm.

[02:24:21.700 --> 02:24:22.820]
SUDs is old and gray.

[02:24:22.960 --> 02:24:23.880]
Well, we're getting old, man.

[02:24:24.040 --> 02:24:24.420]
Yes, we are.

[02:24:25.060 --> 02:24:29.400]
And then we, for the weatherman, kicks the bucket after that bitch call and said, oh, I think he's on his last list.

[02:24:29.820 --> 02:24:31.120]
What'd she say on his deathbed?

[02:24:31.560 --> 02:24:32.180]
I don't remember.

[02:24:32.260 --> 02:24:32.420]
Yeah.

[02:24:32.940 --> 02:24:34.180]
You don't remember because you weren't there.

[02:24:34.180 --> 02:24:35.440]
Josh was there.

[02:24:35.840 --> 02:24:39.340]
Oh, and then this guy with the, um, came art thing, the Walmart.

[02:24:39.980 --> 02:24:40.380]
Wow.

[02:24:40.620 --> 02:24:41.320]
What is that?

[02:24:41.860 --> 02:24:42.620]
What is that?

[02:24:43.100 --> 02:24:44.400]
Now, let me just ask you something.

[02:24:44.460 --> 02:24:49.620]
Is I moving this stuff around a little bit so I can maybe can read it because it's got the Godfather logo is covering over us.

[02:24:49.840 --> 02:24:52.000]
I got you something from Walmart.

[02:24:52.280 --> 02:24:53.660]
Oh, take a puket that.

[02:24:53.840 --> 02:24:54.860]
That is scary.

[02:24:55.420 --> 02:24:57.080]
But there's some human looking people on here.

[02:24:57.220 --> 02:24:58.160]
There are new friends.

[02:24:58.380 --> 02:24:59.180]
We have friends out there.

[02:24:59.520 --> 02:25:03.660]
And believe me, with the way this current regime is running this radio station, we, all the friends we can get.

[02:25:03.660 --> 02:25:04.820]
Believe me.

[02:25:04.880 --> 02:25:06.140]
In fact, that might be the whole audience.

[02:25:06.620 --> 02:25:07.020]
112.

[02:25:07.580 --> 02:25:08.240]
Let me refresh you.

[02:25:08.380 --> 02:25:09.800]
You think, well, I'm talking with my kid, no one.

[02:25:10.160 --> 02:25:10.380]
No.

[02:25:10.620 --> 02:25:11.640]
No, I'm still 112.

[02:25:13.120 --> 02:25:14.720]
It's not exactly taken off.

[02:25:15.520 --> 02:25:17.360]
But it's, it's nifty in this need.

[02:25:17.560 --> 02:25:19.640]
And what it's supposed to accomplish, I have no idea.

[02:25:19.800 --> 02:25:22.180]
But it, yeah, give me a few people something to do.

[02:25:22.320 --> 02:25:24.600]
I have no life during these boring hot summer days, right?

[02:25:24.920 --> 02:25:25.040]
Right.

[02:25:25.560 --> 02:25:27.320]
In between making calls to what's the same.

[02:25:27.540 --> 02:25:28.260]
Hitler, Hitler.

[02:25:29.020 --> 02:25:31.700]
Which I believe someone wrote as a comment on the paper.

[02:25:31.700 --> 02:25:32.900]
They really, yes they did.

[02:25:32.980 --> 02:25:34.340]
Now, now, I'm missing something on here.

[02:25:34.360 --> 02:25:35.380]
Let me go back to that thing.

[02:25:35.540 --> 02:25:38.260]
Am I missing the comment, all the comments or the comments with the pictures?

[02:25:38.460 --> 02:25:43.640]
I haven't really, the comments that people post are would be the bottom right.

[02:25:44.120 --> 02:25:45.240]
So just scroll down.

[02:25:45.500 --> 02:25:46.060]
Bottom right.

[02:25:46.400 --> 02:25:46.520]
Yeah.

[02:25:46.780 --> 02:25:50.940]
Well, I mean, they'll start right under our top 12 friends that we have there.

[02:25:51.500 --> 02:25:53.640]
And I see, but they all have pictures with them.

[02:25:53.820 --> 02:25:53.960]
Right.

[02:25:54.040 --> 02:25:55.180]
Well, that's who posted it.

[02:25:55.300 --> 02:25:55.660]
I understand.

[02:25:56.220 --> 02:25:59.120]
Why are you talking to me like I'm some kind of a child, man?

[02:25:59.440 --> 02:26:00.880]
Well, they're going through my second childhood.

[02:26:00.880 --> 02:26:03.380]
You just said you didn't know where to find the comments.

[02:26:03.380 --> 02:26:04.200]
They're right there for it.

[02:26:04.200 --> 02:26:04.960]
Why don't we find it?

[02:26:05.100 --> 02:26:05.660]
They say comments.

[02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:07.160]
I found it.

[02:26:07.160 --> 02:26:07.580]
What do they?

[02:26:07.680 --> 02:26:09.280]
I might actually go back for it.

[02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:11.540]
If I thought I'd get it, I'll find it again.

[02:26:12.360 --> 02:26:13.500]
Anyway, that's nifty.

[02:26:13.740 --> 02:26:19.780]
And we're like, oh, and also speaking of stuff that has to do with the show, which I realize is unusual.

[02:26:20.280 --> 02:26:22.120]
Where did you find that thing that's on our website?

[02:26:22.340 --> 02:26:23.520]
Let me go to the homepage.

[02:26:23.800 --> 02:26:25.640]
Oh, a listener.

[02:26:26.220 --> 02:26:30.160]
And please don't ask me who, because I'm getting a lot of emails these days with country.

[02:26:30.160 --> 02:26:31.380]
It's a company, a WJD.

[02:26:31.980 --> 02:26:32.080]
Right.

[02:26:32.280 --> 02:26:33.580]
And you listen to that email, that's me.

[02:26:34.220 --> 02:26:34.660]
And there it is.

[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:39.280]
And it's what would Jesus do about all these butchered and murdered children?

[02:26:40.200 --> 02:26:41.640]
It'll choke you up.

[02:26:42.040 --> 02:26:42.180]
Yeah.

[02:26:42.700 --> 02:26:44.140]
Now, everybody needs to take a look at that.

[02:26:44.360 --> 02:26:44.700]
I can't.

[02:26:44.740 --> 02:26:45.220]
I'm going to do it.

[02:26:45.300 --> 02:26:45.760]
Especially Sean.

[02:26:46.160 --> 02:26:48.160]
No, you've got questions out there.

[02:26:48.300 --> 02:26:49.580]
There's so much behind this butchering.

[02:26:49.840 --> 02:26:50.960]
Your butchered are washed in there.

[02:26:51.020 --> 02:26:53.880]
There's that's killing and meaning and wounding and destroying people's lives.

[02:26:54.320 --> 02:26:58.000]
And they're bragging about the fact that, oh, in Baghdad, there are actually some parts of the city

[02:26:58.000 --> 02:26:59.600]
where they're back up to 12 hours of electricity.

[02:27:00.080 --> 02:27:02.560]
It's 115 degrees over there in a shade now.

[02:27:03.160 --> 02:27:05.540]
They're conditioning my ass, which of course couldn't hurt.

[02:27:06.740 --> 02:27:07.900]
But it's just pathetic.

[02:27:08.840 --> 02:27:11.540]
Anyway, Matthew Rothschild has an interesting, it's not really an article.

[02:27:11.720 --> 02:27:14.580]
It's just some facts from the progressive.

[02:27:15.160 --> 02:27:19.580]
The following 13 senators deserve our thanks for courageously voting to withdraw all U.S. trips

[02:27:19.580 --> 02:27:21.120]
from Iraq within the next year.

[02:27:21.580 --> 02:27:22.160]
These 13.

[02:27:22.780 --> 02:27:28.660]
Daniel Akka, oh, and by the way, there's a player on Brazil named Kakka.

[02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:29.460]
Yeah.

[02:27:30.100 --> 02:27:30.600]
Kakka.

[02:27:30.880 --> 02:27:31.600]
That's his name.

[02:27:31.960 --> 02:27:37.420]
And the British announcer, the stuffy British announcer, refused to say that so we kept on Kakka.

[02:27:37.900 --> 02:27:38.240]
Kakka.

[02:27:38.520 --> 02:27:39.320]
How about Kakka?

[02:27:39.740 --> 02:27:40.200]
That would be good.

[02:27:40.980 --> 02:27:43.840]
Anyway, Senator Daniel Akka from Hawaii.

[02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:44.320]
Kakka.

[02:27:45.480 --> 02:27:47.580]
Barbara Boxer of California.

[02:27:47.880 --> 02:27:49.580]

Russ Fein, Gold Wisconsin.

[02:28:02.100 --> 02:28:03.720]
Ron Wyden, Democratic Oregon.

[02:28:04.180 --> 02:28:05.900]
All Democrats, of course, and the independent.

[02:28:06.800 --> 02:28:15.620]
The following Democratic senators opposed the withdrawal amendment, showing once more that the notion of a unified discipline and genuinely opposition party does not exist in this country.

[02:28:15.860 --> 02:28:17.580]
Nor is there a major party devoted to peace.

[02:28:17.580 --> 02:28:21.480]
Here is the rule of shame, says Matthew Rothschilder, rule of shame.

[02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:25.440]
Senator Max Boccus of Montana, Evan Byvin, the energy, oh, Biden of Delaware.

[02:28:25.840 --> 02:28:29.380]

[02:28:39.220 --> 02:28:40.300]
Byron Durgan, North Dakota.

[02:28:40.440 --> 02:28:42.600]
Diane Feinstein of California.

[02:28:42.920 --> 02:28:43.920]
Tim Johnson, South Dakota.

[02:28:44.240 --> 02:28:45.000]
Herb Kuala, Wisconsin.

[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.500]
Mary Landu of Louisiana, Carl Lavin of Michigan.

[02:28:47.920 --> 02:28:48.820]
Jew Lieberman, of course.

[02:28:49.320 --> 02:28:50.340]
Blancs Lincoln of Arkansas.

[02:28:50.800 --> 02:28:52.020]
Barbara McCullesky of Maryland.

[02:28:52.320 --> 02:28:53.560]
Patie Murrier, Washington.

[02:28:53.940 --> 02:28:54.340]
Hey, Patty.

[02:28:54.560 --> 02:28:55.020]
Jew Fairy.

[02:28:55.540 --> 02:28:57.460]
Ben Nelson of Bill Nelson of Florida.

[02:28:57.700 --> 02:28:58.140]
Bill Nelson.

[02:28:58.600 --> 02:28:59.620]
Ben Nelson of Nebraska.

[02:28:59.780 --> 02:29:00.940]
Barack Obama of Illinois.

[02:29:01.080 --> 02:29:02.000]
Mark Prior of Arizona.

[02:29:02.440 --> 02:29:04.020]

Paul Sarbanes of Maryland.

[02:29:08.720 --> 02:29:11.100]
Chuck Schumer of New York and the Debbie Stabano of Michigan.

[02:29:11.740 --> 02:29:12.480]
Even Harry Reid.

[02:29:12.780 --> 02:29:13.160]
No balls.

[02:29:13.160 --> 02:29:16.420]
That Joe Lieberman voted against can hardly be called a shocker.

[02:29:16.480 --> 02:29:19.000]
And he willingly fronted for the Republicans as the website,

[02:29:19.300 --> 02:29:23.800]
CooxonLiars.com points out they called on him first as their own advocate against the amendment.

[02:29:24.200 --> 02:29:29.280]
Every day Lieberman is becoming more and more like Rabbi Bangles door from Philip Ross plot against America.

[02:29:29.720 --> 02:29:31.360]
You know the one who sucked up to Lindbergh?

[02:29:31.440 --> 02:29:31.600]
Yeah.

[02:29:31.980 --> 02:29:35.020]
And note that even the Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid voted against his amendment.

[02:29:35.120 --> 02:29:35.720]
That's the leadership.

[02:29:36.020 --> 02:29:37.780]
Even Barack Obama voted against it.

[02:29:38.040 --> 02:29:40.220]
Chris Dottacan, Joe Biden, Evan Bivode, against it.

[02:29:40.220 --> 02:29:43.540]
And so are we Clinton voted against it to all five of them want to be president.

[02:29:43.820 --> 02:29:46.720]
But these are not profiles encouraged, which I would say.

[02:29:47.040 --> 02:29:48.160]
Absolutely correct.

[02:29:48.480 --> 02:29:49.260]
How do you like that?

[02:29:49.400 --> 02:29:50.560]
It's a finalist bunch of cowards.

[02:29:50.660 --> 02:29:51.040]
That's right.

[02:29:51.760 --> 02:29:52.480]
Just pathetic.

[02:29:53.980 --> 02:29:54.700]
1075 OSP.

[02:29:54.760 --> 02:29:55.260]
So be sure to.

[02:29:55.280 --> 02:29:56.760]
And now I asked you that question.

[02:29:56.940 --> 02:29:57.860]
And I never really got an answer.

[02:29:58.140 --> 02:29:58.780]
What's the question?

[02:29:59.060 --> 02:30:02.440]
Are we going to put a link on myspace.com thing that we got or yes we are.

[02:30:02.760 --> 02:30:03.080]
No.

[02:30:03.420 --> 02:30:05.200]
Because when you think we get a lot more friends that way?

[02:30:05.520 --> 02:30:06.080]
Yes we will.

[02:30:06.380 --> 02:30:07.600]
And we're looking for friends.

[02:30:07.920 --> 02:30:08.580]
Believe me.

[02:30:08.580 --> 02:30:10.060]
Especially in the current environment.

[02:30:10.400 --> 02:30:16.240]
I noticed that on the dollar mattress copy it said Jeff high slash what's it a Gary Sarner?

[02:30:17.260 --> 02:30:17.500]
Okay.

[02:30:17.960 --> 02:30:18.280]
Yeah.

[02:30:18.480 --> 02:30:19.000]
Gary Sarner.

[02:30:19.220 --> 02:30:21.180]
So now that Gary Sarner has got his finger in that account.

[02:30:21.220 --> 02:30:21.540]
Oh.

[02:30:21.920 --> 02:30:22.740]
That's all I can say to that.

[02:30:22.960 --> 02:30:24.060]
Hey we like Gary Sarner.

[02:30:24.480 --> 02:30:25.060]
Why is that?

[02:30:25.180 --> 02:30:25.540]
Oh that's right.

[02:30:25.620 --> 02:30:26.320]
You got your Ruth Chris.

[02:30:26.700 --> 02:30:27.720]
I went in there also.

[02:30:28.060 --> 02:30:28.640]
He went in weird.

[02:30:28.800 --> 02:30:29.880]
And I went to Ruth Chris.

[02:30:30.180 --> 02:30:32.120]
They give you some of those things.

[02:30:32.440 --> 02:30:33.080]
I got a certificate.

[02:30:33.100 --> 02:30:33.860]
I went in there.

[02:30:34.300 --> 02:30:34.560]
I went to town.

[02:30:34.560 --> 02:30:35.220]
I got three of them.

[02:30:35.280 --> 02:30:35.780]
How do you like that?

[02:30:35.780 --> 02:30:36.820]
Well it's not fair.

[02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:37.700]
But you know it's okay.

[02:30:37.960 --> 02:30:38.960]
What do you mean it's not fair?

[02:30:38.980 --> 02:30:39.300]
No joke.

[02:30:39.580 --> 02:30:41.240]
Well I'll deduct that from you next check.

[02:30:41.420 --> 02:30:41.980]
I'll show it.

[02:30:42.420 --> 02:30:43.220]
I took advantage.

[02:30:43.460 --> 02:30:43.960]
It was great.

[02:30:44.320 --> 02:30:45.580]
In fact I'm glad to send you those.

[02:30:45.580 --> 02:30:47.600]
Although I would like to use them here because they got a great.

[02:30:47.880 --> 02:30:48.760]
I mean they're fantastic.

[02:30:48.800 --> 02:30:50.860]
Ruth Chris in the Hilton Hotel downtown to Rome.

[02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:52.860]
Really I heard it was bad so you should just send them down.

[02:30:53.200 --> 02:30:53.240]
Yeah.

[02:30:53.360 --> 02:30:53.980]
So I could use it.

[02:30:54.220 --> 02:30:54.540]
I heard it.

[02:30:54.560 --> 02:30:55.520]
I hear it's great.

[02:30:56.220 --> 02:30:56.640]
No I heard it.

[02:30:56.680 --> 02:30:57.880]
I just heard the four loader ones better.

[02:30:58.100 --> 02:30:59.800]
So if you do want to just send them down it would be better.

[02:31:00.420 --> 02:31:03.020]
So you actually went in there and kissed Gary Sarner's ass huh?

[02:31:03.340 --> 02:31:03.440]
No.

[02:31:03.440 --> 02:31:08.080]
I met the chef at the L that came in and you know brought the food when we were in here.

[02:31:08.880 --> 02:31:10.800]
And so I had to see who all was there though.

[02:31:10.960 --> 02:31:12.220]
That's right Tommy was there that day.

[02:31:12.300 --> 02:31:13.140]
George was invocation.

[02:31:13.260 --> 02:31:14.780]
George got screwed over badly.

[02:31:14.920 --> 02:31:15.020]
Yeah.

[02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:17.280]
I'll make up somehow.

[02:31:17.700 --> 02:31:18.220]
Boy that's bad.

[02:31:18.380 --> 02:31:19.060]
Tommy man.

[02:31:19.200 --> 02:31:21.100]
He was in there like at seven o'clock in the morning.

[02:31:21.280 --> 02:31:22.220]
Tommy deserves it.

[02:31:22.400 --> 02:31:22.540]
Yeah.

[02:31:23.120 --> 02:31:25.300]
Especially after the way clearance brow beats him you know.

[02:31:25.480 --> 02:31:25.720]
That's right.

[02:31:26.480 --> 02:31:28.300]
114 at 560 WQM.

[02:31:28.420 --> 02:31:32.900]
Tell you about great food is easy to do when you know how good it is like the melting pot for example.

[02:31:32.900 --> 02:31:35.100]
I've been melting potter for years and years.

[02:31:35.220 --> 02:31:36.940]
That goes all the way back to Zeta.

[02:31:37.540 --> 02:31:41.180]
If you haven't been in one of South Florida's melting pot restaurants in a while now it's time to go back

[02:31:41.180 --> 02:31:44.340]
because it is really quite an experience and better than ever before too.

[02:31:44.660 --> 02:31:47.160]
As you guys know because at least you don't get messed up on that.

[02:31:47.360 --> 02:31:49.840]
You've been there a couple of times when a melting pot comes out of bread.

[02:31:50.240 --> 02:31:50.960]
And they'll be in your body.

[02:31:51.120 --> 02:31:52.420]
You eat so much you do get messed up.

[02:31:52.720 --> 02:31:55.880]
It's a full four course dining experience starting with a renowned cheese fondue.

[02:31:56.180 --> 02:31:57.600]
Serve with three different breads.

[02:31:57.960 --> 02:31:59.480]
Granny Smith apples and crisp veggies.

[02:31:59.980 --> 02:32:01.580]
Next comes your choice of lively salads.

[02:32:01.580 --> 02:32:06.660]
Your own trays include a combination of lobster, filet mignon, shrimp, cajun, seasoned chicken, pork, duck,

[02:32:06.940 --> 02:32:10.220]
portabella mushrooms and lots more cooked in oil or broth, whichever you prefer.

[02:32:10.680 --> 02:32:12.780]
And don't forget the melting pot homemade dipping sauces.

[02:32:13.260 --> 02:32:15.420]
That's what makes the fondue experience fun and really tasty.

[02:32:15.540 --> 02:32:19.920]
And now of course speaking of tasty the clincher that every meal with the melting pot is those fantastic.

[02:32:20.140 --> 02:32:21.440]
Be those fantastic desserts.

[02:32:22.060 --> 02:32:26.740]
Like their chocolate fondue with fresh strawberries, bananas, pineapples, all your fresh favorite fruits,

[02:32:27.300 --> 02:32:31.560]
cheesecake, brownies and tasty marshmallows rolled in crushed Oreos or graham crackers for dipping.

[02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:33.180]
But there's nothing in a world like it.

[02:32:33.320 --> 02:32:34.700]
It's only waiting for you at the melting pot.

[02:32:35.040 --> 02:32:39.440]
So if you're getting tired and bored of the same old crap, take the whole gang off for real treat at the melting pot nearby.

[02:32:39.680 --> 02:32:41.000]
You would tell middle of Neil sent you by.

[02:32:41.240 --> 02:32:46.740]
There's a pot in Coral Springs, Miami Beach, North Miami Beach, Cooper City, for Lauderdale, Kendall and even prestigious Voka.

[02:32:47.920 --> 02:32:49.680]
And I'm sitting here with this thing all screw up.

[02:32:50.320 --> 02:32:52.120]
This is meal Roger.

[02:32:52.300 --> 02:32:53.040]
That's what the one.

[02:32:53.320 --> 02:32:55.980]
This is the best finger baby.

[02:32:58.680 --> 02:32:59.720]
Holy Makinah.

[02:32:59.900 --> 02:33:05.260]
This is Joe Bohr and the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening to the Hockey Authority Neil God.

[02:33:10.700 --> 02:33:11.220]
Absolutely.

[02:33:18.160 --> 02:33:18.960]
Yeah.

[02:33:19.360 --> 02:33:25.640]
So living out of control, corporate goals have the recognition.

[02:33:26.380 --> 02:33:33.300]
Trains get every past to grow like our own road, fully tied in a nation of land.

[02:33:33.460 --> 02:33:38.860]
We're loyalty to the service and value, you'll find our advantage now.

[02:33:38.860 --> 02:33:46.020]
We're all dedicated by the rather common cultural.

[02:33:47.380 --> 02:33:54.700]
We're all dedicated by the two that they're holding and they're holding in their soul.

[02:34:00.980 --> 02:34:05.780]
But the mighty is a proud of all that ain't all over.

[02:34:06.040 --> 02:34:07.800]
It's a high view patient.

[02:34:08.340 --> 02:34:24.260]
Running baby, then high for Christ, for the poor right, in other things, let's make sure you find your country.

[02:34:24.260 --> 02:34:28.220]
That's what our place is right here by.

[02:34:29.460 --> 02:34:33.760]
Don't pay me in my house, you got this right here.

[02:34:33.920 --> 02:34:36.700]
You've got it here, you've got this right here.

[02:34:36.700 --> 02:34:42.180]
You've got a place right here, you've got a place right here.

[02:34:43.480 --> 02:34:46.360]
You've got a place right here, you've got a place right here.

[02:34:46.680 --> 02:34:50.180]
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.

[02:34:50.300 --> 02:34:51.760]
I'm dying out of here.

[02:34:51.760 --> 02:34:54.700]
121 a.k.o.a.m. I tell you, I do like the grassroots a lot.

[02:34:55.080 --> 02:34:55.180]
Yes.

[02:34:55.280 --> 02:34:58.100]
And that stuff was all on there and it all cracked me simply as it was.

[02:34:58.940 --> 02:35:01.660]
3600 and some odd songs in my iPod have only just begun.

[02:35:01.800 --> 02:35:03.540]
Like the curbiners would say, only the death on their teeth.

[02:35:04.140 --> 02:35:04.940]
I know it's on there.

[02:35:05.540 --> 02:35:06.200]
Yeah, I was on it.

[02:35:06.400 --> 02:35:11.540]
Well, the flight back from Amsterdam to Toronto was not one of the all-time best.

[02:35:12.180 --> 02:35:13.440]
But it sure killed some good time.

[02:35:13.920 --> 02:35:14.980]
I don't want to go through all the problems.

[02:35:15.080 --> 02:35:18.640]
The plane was too hot and they couldn't board and then by the beep, but it just, you know,

[02:35:18.640 --> 02:35:22.160]
it's just the traveling thing is not what it used to be.

[02:35:22.280 --> 02:35:23.460]
It's going to be a real pain in the glass.

[02:35:24.340 --> 02:35:24.940]
1292 votes.

[02:35:25.060 --> 02:35:28.360]
So I guess I'll let you guys take those seats next time, like the next time the Europe.

[02:35:28.760 --> 02:35:28.980]
All right.

[02:35:29.400 --> 02:35:29.840]
Sounds good.

[02:35:30.600 --> 02:35:34.920]
St. Augustine Florida, the jury that found Justin Barbara guilty of murdering his wife

[02:35:34.920 --> 02:35:37.500]
during a stroll on the beach, his recommended that he received the death penalty.

[02:35:38.100 --> 02:35:42.260]
The panel which deliberated for 51 minutes was split eight to four in favor of the death penalty.

[02:35:42.740 --> 02:35:46.340]
Josh Edward Headstrom will make the ultimate sentencing decision, but under Florida law,

[02:35:46.340 --> 02:35:49.720]
he must give great weight to the recommendation of the jurors.

[02:35:50.060 --> 02:35:52.660]
Instead of mounting a defense to a death sentence yesterday,

[02:35:53.060 --> 02:35:57.680]
a lawyer for Barbara chastised the jury and said that a defendant had decided on principle

[02:35:57.680 --> 02:35:59.500]
not to allow relatives to plead for his life.

[02:35:59.980 --> 02:36:01.500]
He will not put his family through that.

[02:36:01.780 --> 02:36:04.600]
He will not do that in an effort to seek mercy for a crime he didn't commit.

[02:36:04.880 --> 02:36:07.580]
The defense attorney Robert Willis said during grief remarks to the jury

[02:36:07.580 --> 02:36:10.420]
that found the 34-year-old guilty Saturday of murdering his wife.

[02:36:10.740 --> 02:36:16.120]
As the defendant looked on from the defense table, his attorney told jurors he was dumbfounded by the decision.

[02:36:16.120 --> 02:36:17.500]
He looked at him all and went,

[02:36:18.100 --> 02:36:20.840]
like that, and then what they should have done, the OJ trial?

[02:36:21.760 --> 02:36:23.680]
The jury should have looked at the jurors and gone,

[02:36:24.500 --> 02:36:25.140]
like that.

[02:36:25.980 --> 02:36:27.440]
Although I think that's what OJ did, wasn't he?

[02:36:27.580 --> 02:36:29.100]
Went, kind of like that.

[02:36:30.060 --> 02:36:31.720]
I'm not going to find that thing.

[02:36:32.460 --> 02:36:34.400]
Juice, you know what I'm talking about?

[02:36:34.680 --> 02:36:35.660]
What do you tell me? No juice.

[02:36:35.860 --> 02:36:37.880]
Oh, man, different energy is not that a big thing.

[02:36:37.960 --> 02:36:38.440]
It's all there.

[02:36:38.680 --> 02:36:38.980]
There it is.

[02:36:39.440 --> 02:36:41.640]
Anyway, as the defendant looked on, I just said that.

[02:36:41.780 --> 02:36:43.400]
I don't know how you got where you are.

[02:36:43.400 --> 02:36:47.280]
He said, shaking you said, echoing accuracy made against police and the closing argument of the trial.

[02:36:47.360 --> 02:36:51.160]
Willis said, apparently you have found every sinister inference there is.

[02:36:51.340 --> 02:36:55.400]
The six men and six women on the jury stared back at Willis with blank expressions like,

[02:36:55.840 --> 02:36:56.020]
huh?

[02:36:57.360 --> 02:37:00.220]
The panelists returned to the jury room yesterday more

[02:37:00.220 --> 02:37:02.740]
and decided whether Barbara should receive death or lack in prison,

[02:37:02.880 --> 02:37:05.480]
but not the possibility of parole for gunning down his wife April.

[02:37:05.880 --> 02:37:07.500]
I'm deserted beach in 2002.

[02:37:07.840 --> 02:37:11.060]
He claimed she was killed by a mugger who also shot him four times.

[02:37:11.620 --> 02:37:12.140]
What do you think?

[02:37:12.560 --> 02:37:13.000]
About what?

[02:37:13.080 --> 02:37:13.740]
I think the bitch had a coming.

[02:37:14.420 --> 02:37:14.740]
Probably.

[02:37:14.860 --> 02:37:18.200]
By the way, you know, I noticed one of our friends out there, 119 friends that we have on at

[02:37:18.200 --> 02:37:23.580]
new, uh, my, uh, place.com is, uh, Johnny G.

[02:37:23.920 --> 02:37:24.200]
Hope.

[02:37:24.700 --> 02:37:25.260]
Oh, come on.

[02:37:25.360 --> 02:37:26.600]
No one would Johnny G's pizza.

[02:37:26.700 --> 02:37:27.560]
Not us before your time.

[02:37:27.640 --> 02:37:28.620]
I close way back to Zeta.

[02:37:28.840 --> 02:37:28.980]
Right.

[02:37:29.540 --> 02:37:30.160]
Johnny G.

[02:37:30.320 --> 02:37:32.740]
He's the fastest every now and occasionally still out there.

[02:37:33.160 --> 02:37:36.900]
That's the kind of people we need to hear from on our, uh, that thing on my space place.

[02:37:37.200 --> 02:37:38.440]
Yeah, I'm looking at Rosie right now.

[02:37:38.760 --> 02:37:39.600]
And I bet you are.

[02:37:40.140 --> 02:37:41.520]
I wonder if there's anybody I'm looking at.

[02:37:41.520 --> 02:37:42.400]
No, not yet.

[02:37:42.820 --> 02:37:45.060]
Although I looked at the, uh, there was somebody on there.

[02:37:45.340 --> 02:37:46.440]
Well, let me look at him.

[02:37:46.880 --> 02:37:49.960]
There's Jay who's like got a fat face like me and not as old though.

[02:37:50.440 --> 02:37:51.300]
What are you laughing about?

[02:37:51.740 --> 02:37:52.560]
Oh, there's Matthias.

[02:37:52.800 --> 02:37:53.240]
And you know what?

[02:37:53.260 --> 02:37:54.460]
See what Matthias' comment is?

[02:37:54.700 --> 02:37:54.980]
Yeah.

[02:37:57.220 --> 02:37:58.020]
Nice Matthias.

[02:37:58.540 --> 02:38:01.180]
I wonder if he's akin to Matthias Nordstrom, a hockey player.

[02:38:01.500 --> 02:38:02.740]
Well, there's, uh, what's his name?

[02:38:03.380 --> 02:38:03.780]
Sammy Walito.

[02:38:04.300 --> 02:38:05.100]
Sam Walito?

[02:38:05.800 --> 02:38:06.600]
Oh, no.

[02:38:07.080 --> 02:38:07.560]
Isn't that cute?

[02:38:07.940 --> 02:38:08.480]
That's very cute.

[02:38:08.840 --> 02:38:10.100]
Yeah, this would give us something extra to do.

[02:38:10.100 --> 02:38:12.720]
We'd all these comments from our five friends.

[02:38:13.140 --> 02:38:13.900]
How many we got?

[02:38:14.440 --> 02:38:15.220]
Well, let me ask, I see.

[02:38:15.380 --> 02:38:18.200]
In other words, just the ones that send the pictures that are ones that are like, uh,

[02:38:18.700 --> 02:38:20.380]
no, anybody can send a comment.

[02:38:20.400 --> 02:38:24.000]
The thing is, like, to be, like, you have to have an account to be a friend.

[02:38:24.140 --> 02:38:25.680]
You know, you got a nice space set one up.

[02:38:25.680 --> 02:38:26.180]
I mean, it's free.

[02:38:26.380 --> 02:38:27.160]
Oh, 116.

[02:38:27.420 --> 02:38:28.420]
Excuse me, 116.

[02:38:28.540 --> 02:38:29.140]
I'm exaggerating.

[02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:29.740]
I said, 119.

[02:38:29.960 --> 02:38:31.460]
We have only 116 friends.

[02:38:31.560 --> 02:38:33.620]
We feel really, really bad about that.

[02:38:33.840 --> 02:38:34.460]
Don't you feel bad?

[02:38:34.780 --> 02:38:35.360]
No, not really.

[02:38:35.700 --> 02:38:36.260]
We just got to go.

[02:38:37.160 --> 02:38:37.800]
116 friends.

[02:38:38.600 --> 02:38:40.080]
I've discovered that sometimes one of them

[02:38:40.080 --> 02:38:42.600]
is enough, depending on, you know, the time and the circumstances.

[02:38:43.820 --> 02:38:46.200]
26 past one at five, 60 WQA.

[02:38:46.240 --> 02:38:48.760]
Well, I tell you one thing, you know, when you're not doing these shows very often,

[02:38:48.900 --> 02:38:51.540]
it seems like, what, 40, 50 hours ago we sat down here?

[02:38:51.860 --> 02:38:52.960]
Holy cow rat.

[02:38:53.060 --> 02:38:53.560]
Man, man.

[02:38:54.500 --> 02:38:55.240]
Just mark it down.

[02:38:55.360 --> 02:38:57.900]
That today I'm complaining about being overworked during these summer months.

[02:38:58.400 --> 02:39:01.140]
Just mark that down and see what kind of response you get around the building.

[02:39:01.140 --> 02:39:01.860]
That would probably be.

[02:39:02.140 --> 02:39:04.340]
Probably be giving you the Italian salute and several other.

[02:39:04.340 --> 02:39:06.580]
Right away, Brazil beat out the Agonna Ria team.

[02:39:06.980 --> 02:39:08.520]
I think it was three in the old for Brazil.

[02:39:08.520 --> 02:39:10.400]
All your world cupers out there.

[02:39:11.300 --> 02:39:12.980]
How long does that go on?

[02:39:13.180 --> 02:39:16.240]
My God, it just goes on and on for like ever.

[02:39:16.980 --> 02:39:19.600]
And they have all these, they have some of the games in cities in Germany

[02:39:19.600 --> 02:39:20.800]
that I've ever heard of before.

[02:39:21.280 --> 02:39:22.900]
Although I think I'd like to check them all out.

[02:39:23.020 --> 02:39:25.680]
All the cities in Germany, especially going back to Berlin and Cologne.

[02:39:26.460 --> 02:39:29.300]
If you're a cigar smoker, you like to keep back with the good premium brand.

[02:39:29.420 --> 02:39:31.940]
And the he is cigars by Tony Brahani is for you.

[02:39:32.460 --> 02:39:33.240]
These are hard to find.

[02:39:33.360 --> 02:39:36.880]
Stogies are made with first grade tobacco processed and aged up to 10 years.

[02:39:36.880 --> 02:39:39.520]
Now, but here, like I've been telling you for a long time,

[02:39:39.960 --> 02:39:43.720]
is a real boutique cigar maker specializing in small batch hard to find tobacco.

[02:39:44.100 --> 02:39:46.600]
But here, gold a flagship line gets the 91 rating by cigar,

[02:39:46.700 --> 02:39:48.060]
Fisting Outro's cigar and cider.

[02:39:48.220 --> 02:39:50.460]
And the 9.1 rating by Schmoke Magazine.

[02:39:51.080 --> 02:39:53.580]
This rich flavor and well balanced full-bodied Nicaragua and cigar.

[02:39:55.500 --> 02:39:57.060]
See? It's like Stand Major.

[02:39:57.900 --> 02:40:01.100]
It's got earthy, hint-to-dark roast coffee, chuffles, pice and pepper flavors.

[02:40:01.500 --> 02:40:03.140]
Also, be sure to try to be here to sail.

[02:40:03.140 --> 02:40:05.160]
The hottest release of cigar in the last 10 months,

[02:40:05.460 --> 02:40:09.200]
the sail gets a high rating of 91 by cigar, Fisting Outro's cigar and cider.

[02:40:09.620 --> 02:40:12.500]
It's a big, powerful cigar and will make you gag and choke like I just did

[02:40:12.500 --> 02:40:14.560]
with complex notes of leather, earth and pepper.

[02:40:14.960 --> 02:40:16.340]
Now, finish is long and full-bodied,

[02:40:16.460 --> 02:40:18.440]
with additional spice and an odor of charred wood.

[02:40:18.840 --> 02:40:22.300]
To receive 40%, you want to say almost half the price of all your beehive cigars.

[02:40:22.600 --> 02:40:24.880]
When you call an order, I'm just telling you the arrived you're told to do call.

[02:40:25.200 --> 02:40:26.820]
And you'll say 40%, nearly half.

[02:40:27.120 --> 02:40:28.840]
Call 1 835 beehive.

[02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.140]
That's 1 835 BAHI.

[02:40:31.140 --> 02:40:35.300]
And this is Neil Rogers.

[02:40:35.760 --> 02:40:39.700]
What solid mix is 516 QA cells?

[02:40:40.820 --> 02:40:43.280]
Grab my junior, honey.

[02:40:50.160 --> 02:40:54.200]
This was the moment you dreaded the most.

[02:40:56.940 --> 02:41:01.180]
A miracle voted in guess what you lost.

[02:41:04.240 --> 02:41:07.580]
Secret told me you can no longer stay.

[02:41:08.100 --> 02:41:10.860]
You fall ahead nothing nice to stay.

[02:41:11.540 --> 02:41:14.740]
And then they put your montage on.

[02:41:17.560 --> 02:41:21.320]
Your musical career has gone aground.

[02:41:24.620 --> 02:41:28.440]
And you've been neutered by the dog pound.

[02:41:31.300 --> 02:41:34.320]
Gotta sing a song before you go away.

[02:41:35.420 --> 02:41:38.000]
Say one no one's like yesterday.

[02:41:39.020 --> 02:41:42.540]
It is the reason that you're gone.

[02:41:43.340 --> 02:41:45.320]
Cause you sang a bad song.

[02:41:45.800 --> 02:41:48.480]
You wore a bad shirt, so I'm a tagger word.

[02:41:50.420 --> 02:41:52.300]
You said you'll be fun.

[02:41:52.460 --> 02:41:53.960]
You still be a star.

[02:41:54.120 --> 02:41:57.440]
But I'm not from now, you'll be parking cars.

[02:41:57.860 --> 02:41:59.060]
You sang a bad song.

[02:41:59.520 --> 02:42:00.840]
You know you still see.

[02:42:01.260 --> 02:42:02.660]
You've 15 minutes.

[02:42:02.920 --> 02:42:06.160]
You sang a bad song.

[02:42:07.540 --> 02:42:09.760]
You sang a bad song.

[02:42:10.600 --> 02:42:13.540]
130 at 560 WQM got something breathtaking.

[02:42:13.820 --> 02:42:15.760]
Earth shocking coming over my thing right now.

[02:42:15.760 --> 02:42:16.420]
Yeah.

[02:42:16.640 --> 02:42:17.800]
I'm just printing it out.

[02:42:18.020 --> 02:42:18.340]
Oh, okay.

[02:42:18.880 --> 02:42:21.260]
Remember that story we had earlier about Russian is Viagra?

[02:42:21.420 --> 02:42:22.180]
The TV?

[02:42:22.460 --> 02:42:22.680]
Bar.

[02:42:23.360 --> 02:42:25.480]
Reich's limbalt could see a deal with prosecutors

[02:42:25.480 --> 02:42:27.800]
in a long-running prescription fraud case collapsed.

[02:42:28.560 --> 02:42:30.840]
After a 30-sought abodal of Vagrin is bagged

[02:42:30.840 --> 02:42:34.100]
Palmits International Report, the prescription was not in his name.

[02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.400]
Limp ball was detained for more than three hours yesterday

[02:42:37.400 --> 02:42:39.120]
at the airport after returning from a vacation

[02:42:39.120 --> 02:42:40.680]
in La Republic of Dminikana.

[02:42:41.320 --> 02:42:43.740]
Customs officials found the Vagrin as lucky as his name

[02:42:43.740 --> 02:42:45.340]
was not in the prescriptions at Paul Miller.

[02:42:45.340 --> 02:42:47.700]
A spokesman for the Palmits County Sheriff's Orifice.

[02:42:48.380 --> 02:42:50.440]
Miller said the alleged violation could be a second

[02:42:50.440 --> 02:42:53.120]
to be Mr. Meener, the sheriff's office was investigating

[02:42:53.120 --> 02:42:55.300]
and will soon turn the case over to the State Attorney's Orifice,

[02:42:55.620 --> 02:42:56.880]
which had no media comment today.

[02:42:57.500 --> 02:42:59.340]
Under the deal reached last month with prosecutors,

[02:42:59.540 --> 02:43:02.220]
Limbalt was not to be arrested for any infraction for 18 months

[02:43:02.220 --> 02:43:05.380]
in exchange for authorities deferring a charge of doctor shopping.

[02:43:06.700 --> 02:43:08.960]
Prosecutors had alleged a conservative talk show host illegally

[02:43:08.960 --> 02:43:11.680]
deceived multiple physicians to receive overlapping

[02:43:11.680 --> 02:43:13.120]
painkiller prescriptions.

[02:43:13.300 --> 02:43:13.640]
Absolutely.

[02:43:14.620 --> 02:43:16.900]
Limbalt also must submit to random drug tests and continue

[02:43:16.900 --> 02:43:18.640]
treatment for his admitted addiction to painkillers.

[02:43:19.720 --> 02:43:21.500]
Limbalt's doctor had prescribed the Vagrin,

[02:43:21.500 --> 02:43:24.180]
but was labeled as being issued to the physician rather than Mr. Limbalt

[02:43:24.180 --> 02:43:26.620]
for privacy purposes, Roy Black, Limbalt's attorney,

[02:43:26.620 --> 02:43:27.360]
sent the statement.

[02:43:27.660 --> 02:43:27.900]
Right.

[02:43:28.340 --> 02:43:29.260]
For privacy purposes.

[02:43:29.760 --> 02:43:31.400]
If you get the vibe where everybody in the world

[02:43:31.400 --> 02:43:33.680]
knew you can find out, but if Russia needs it,

[02:43:33.800 --> 02:43:34.980]
then we don't want to say that.

[02:43:35.600 --> 02:43:36.800]
That would be bad for his images.

[02:43:36.800 --> 02:43:39.080]
This macho right wing piece of dirt, you know what I'm saying?

[02:43:39.920 --> 02:43:42.280]
U.S. Customs and Border Protection Exam

[02:43:42.280 --> 02:43:44.120]
of the 55-year-old radio commentators

[02:43:44.120 --> 02:43:47.440]
luggage after his private plane landed the ever-oys private plane

[02:43:47.440 --> 02:43:48.400]
excuse me.

[02:43:48.440 --> 02:43:48.840]
Reef.

[02:43:50.160 --> 02:43:53.180]
Investigators confiscated the drugs which treat erectile dysfunction.

[02:43:53.620 --> 02:43:55.220]
Limbalt was released without being charged.

[02:43:55.760 --> 02:43:56.560]
He didn't get his charge.

[02:43:56.960 --> 02:43:58.580]
And there were no two happy about it.

[02:43:58.680 --> 02:43:59.220]
How do you like that?

[02:44:00.240 --> 02:44:02.080]
So he may be a screw up as other deal.

[02:44:02.180 --> 02:44:03.060]
Wouldn't that be a shame, huh?

[02:44:03.280 --> 02:44:04.060]
Yeah, that would be bad.

[02:44:04.260 --> 02:44:04.880]
Tray Trasheek.

[02:44:04.960 --> 02:44:05.240]
Yeah.

[02:44:05.400 --> 02:44:06.620]
Well, look at what we got on the pool.

[02:44:06.760 --> 02:44:07.360]
11-11.

[02:44:07.360 --> 02:44:09.120]
First time I think in history.

[02:44:09.740 --> 02:44:10.240]
What do I tell you?

[02:44:10.300 --> 02:44:12.140]
I may not be doing a lot of shows this summer, but boy,

[02:44:12.200 --> 02:44:14.740]
they're going to be record breaking and earth shocking

[02:44:14.740 --> 02:44:15.900]
and news making.

[02:44:16.380 --> 02:44:18.080]
That will be on the front page of the Sunset Lamar.

[02:44:18.240 --> 02:44:19.400]
A special time jicker report.

[02:44:19.900 --> 02:44:21.180]
1111 votes on the pool.

[02:44:21.220 --> 02:44:22.480]
It's not even 135 yet.

[02:44:22.740 --> 02:44:23.080]
What do you think?

[02:44:23.640 --> 02:44:24.040]
I'm not sure.

[02:44:24.560 --> 02:44:26.720]
I still have issues with the Sunset, by the way.

[02:44:27.040 --> 02:44:28.060]
Would they have the website?

[02:44:28.640 --> 02:44:28.820]
It sucks.

[02:44:29.640 --> 02:44:30.440]
1111 votes.

[02:44:30.520 --> 02:44:31.920]
What's your take on the World Cup?

[02:44:32.100 --> 02:44:33.360]
Soccer is so boring.

[02:44:34.320 --> 02:44:34.940]
Oh, amen.

[02:44:35.160 --> 02:44:35.780]
4 to 13.

[02:44:36.500 --> 02:44:38.140]
Moderately interested, 296.

[02:44:38.620 --> 02:44:39.100]
I love it.

[02:44:39.180 --> 02:44:40.740]
Watching it on TV, 224.

[02:44:41.140 --> 02:44:42.400]
What's the World Cup, 82?

[02:44:43.100 --> 02:44:45.200]
As boring as watching any other sport, 62.

[02:44:45.540 --> 02:44:48.200]
And I hate this pool, Tranky Quattro, 34.

[02:44:48.960 --> 02:44:49.620]
What I call it?

[02:44:50.060 --> 02:44:50.500]
I got a right.

[02:44:50.900 --> 02:44:51.340]
Close it up.

[02:44:51.720 --> 02:44:51.980]
Yeah.

[02:44:52.480 --> 02:44:55.940]
Well, I start with the Spanish and the Italian and the Japanese.

[02:44:56.240 --> 02:44:56.980]
And I start over to that.

[02:44:57.580 --> 02:44:58.180]
It's very different.

[02:44:58.280 --> 02:44:59.760]
Now, this thing about Anita Marx.

[02:45:00.260 --> 02:45:03.300]
What you're assignment for tomorrow morning early is to beat the crap out of the beast.

[02:45:03.620 --> 02:45:04.980]
Stick them with the Red Hot Poker.

[02:45:04.980 --> 02:45:07.300]
It should be easy to find.

[02:45:07.900 --> 02:45:08.080]
God.

[02:45:08.660 --> 02:45:10.460]
Who, do you have any idea who that is Anita Marx?

[02:45:10.940 --> 02:45:12.840]
She was on like something like called Make Believe.

[02:45:13.180 --> 02:45:15.500]
I think she was on that 1,400 thing.

[02:45:16.040 --> 02:45:16.160]
Yeah.

[02:45:16.500 --> 02:45:19.500]
And this goes back to that sports fraternity there again inside of the building.

[02:45:19.840 --> 02:45:21.560]
We don't care about Anita Marx.

[02:45:21.900 --> 02:45:27.120]
We care a lot more about Groucho Marx and Harpo and Zepo and Chico.

[02:45:28.160 --> 02:45:30.380]
Chico, we don't care about Anita Marx.

[02:45:30.580 --> 02:45:31.660]
She don't get no high marks from us.

[02:45:31.700 --> 02:45:33.580]
And nobody has any idea who that is.

[02:45:33.580 --> 02:45:35.860]
All I heard that she was in playboy looked up her pictures.

[02:45:36.860 --> 02:45:39.680]
And I don't know if they make brown bags big enough to cover that nose.

[02:45:39.940 --> 02:45:40.260]
Really?

[02:45:40.500 --> 02:45:40.660]
Yeah.

[02:45:41.020 --> 02:45:43.840]
So like I said, why would we care about Anita Marx, Bisto?

[02:45:44.180 --> 02:45:44.780]
Other than Harpo.

[02:45:45.120 --> 02:45:47.800]
I mean, assuming you did find a bag big enough, she got a pretty nice bag.

[02:45:49.100 --> 02:45:49.420]
Oh.

[02:45:50.220 --> 02:45:50.540]
Right.

[02:45:50.820 --> 02:45:51.880]
In other words, she's in the TV.

[02:45:51.980 --> 02:45:52.920]
She had to be in the TV business.

[02:45:53.120 --> 02:45:53.860]
She's got a fine set.

[02:45:54.120 --> 02:45:54.540]
Is that what you're saying?

[02:45:54.640 --> 02:45:55.180]
She's got a butter face.

[02:45:55.860 --> 02:45:56.320]
Everything's nice.

[02:45:56.820 --> 02:45:57.200]
Butter face.

[02:45:58.680 --> 02:46:00.940]
Can you believe it's really not...

[02:46:03.420 --> 02:46:03.780]
Parkay.

[02:46:04.120 --> 02:46:04.480]
Yeah.

[02:46:05.820 --> 02:46:07.000]
Oh my god.

[02:46:07.260 --> 02:46:08.240]
Tuchet Parkay.

[02:46:08.500 --> 02:46:10.640]
But whatever happened in those spots, those were good spots.

[02:46:11.120 --> 02:46:11.320]
Butter.

[02:46:11.400 --> 02:46:11.640]
They were.

[02:46:11.820 --> 02:46:12.100]
They were.

[02:46:12.100 --> 02:46:14.940]
They know it's a great spot that was about 100 years ago for you, punk stuff.

[02:46:15.100 --> 02:46:16.960]
I haven't seen those in a long time.

[02:46:17.180 --> 02:46:17.560]
Those were good.

[02:46:17.860 --> 02:46:18.300]
I'm taking you.

[02:46:18.700 --> 02:46:19.040]
Yeah.

[02:46:19.480 --> 02:46:22.540]
Oh, in this spot, you know what they were talking about?

[02:46:24.040 --> 02:46:25.860]
In Argentina and in Brazil.

[02:46:26.020 --> 02:46:27.560]
Well, it's so different than Dave County.

[02:46:28.060 --> 02:46:30.040]
You know what they watch all day long on the TV?

[02:46:30.040 --> 02:46:30.920]
I give up.

[02:46:31.200 --> 02:46:32.300]
No, you don't.

[02:46:32.300 --> 02:46:32.740]
So far.

[02:46:33.240 --> 02:46:33.540]
Right.

[02:46:33.840 --> 02:46:34.240]
All day.

[02:46:34.340 --> 02:46:34.680]
Oh, yeah.

[02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:38.160]
Now, these are those same, of course, I don't want to say much of guys in Brazil because I think

[02:46:38.160 --> 02:46:39.600]
that would be getting carried away.

[02:46:39.980 --> 02:46:41.180]
Much of ladies in Brazil.

[02:46:41.980 --> 02:46:45.300]
But, yeah, the Latinos are very, very, and also in a spiny manner.

[02:46:45.400 --> 02:46:47.140]
Very big on those, what do you know, Venezuela?

[02:46:47.680 --> 02:46:47.880]
Seat.

[02:46:48.260 --> 02:46:48.900]
Well, they're huge.

[02:46:48.980 --> 02:46:50.820]
You know, we're pretty big on them here in the studio too.

[02:46:51.300 --> 02:46:52.500]
Yeah, and they have it for different reasons.

[02:46:53.720 --> 02:46:54.020]
Yeah.

[02:46:54.220 --> 02:46:54.520]
Perverts.

[02:46:54.760 --> 02:46:56.420]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:46:56.620 --> 02:46:58.520]
We got Kim Bo-Kamp, we're two mad dog at four.

[02:46:58.520 --> 02:47:01.260]
He'll tell you all about that very Jackass column from Friday.

[02:47:01.820 --> 02:47:05.240]
See, how come we have very Jackass put in the paper and they say, well, it's not definite

[02:47:05.240 --> 02:47:10.600]
and we don't know when and since Mo got blown out and whatever, very sad.

[02:47:11.120 --> 02:47:14.440]
See, the one thing, maybe the man, maybe the name of the manager has changed, but they're still

[02:47:14.440 --> 02:47:17.240]
programming the station through the very Jackass column in the Harold.

[02:47:17.520 --> 02:47:19.080]
Didn't work before and could have worked now.

[02:47:19.740 --> 02:47:20.640]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:47:21.240 --> 02:47:22.680]
Neil, you look like you're still righteous.

[02:47:23.580 --> 02:47:24.600]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:47:25.100 --> 02:47:25.560]
Hey, Neil.

[02:47:26.040 --> 02:47:26.360]
Yes, sir.

[02:47:26.360 --> 02:47:30.860]
You're not going to believe it, but when I got into the car, you were mentioning that I need a

[02:47:30.860 --> 02:47:31.620]
Mark's person.

[02:47:31.860 --> 02:47:32.160]
Yeah.

[02:47:32.320 --> 02:47:33.380]
I know who that is.

[02:47:33.500 --> 02:47:34.280]
Do you want to know who that is?

[02:47:34.840 --> 02:47:36.540]
I just got to tell you who it is.

[02:47:36.740 --> 02:47:41.340]
Oh, you did say it was a lady quarterback for the Miami football team, the lady.

[02:47:41.400 --> 02:47:42.120]
Miami theory.

[02:47:42.580 --> 02:47:43.100]
Right, right.

[02:47:43.200 --> 02:47:43.400]
Okay.

[02:47:43.640 --> 02:47:44.720]
Now, another thing, Neil.

[02:47:44.980 --> 02:47:46.220]
But nobody cares about her.

[02:47:46.340 --> 02:47:48.120]
I don't understand who knows who that is.

[02:47:48.180 --> 02:47:51.700]
And in these ways, all my face papers sending me a big story about how she's in Baltimore

[02:47:51.700 --> 02:47:53.160]
and nobody cares there either.

[02:47:53.160 --> 02:47:56.680]
Now, another thing, you mentioned Tony Sigerado is going to fill in, right?

[02:47:57.080 --> 02:47:58.400]
Thursday morning for the hump of his.

[02:47:58.880 --> 02:47:58.880]

[02:47:58.960 --> 02:48:05.740]
What show or actually what station was it when they had Shappy Goldstein and the engine killer,

[02:48:05.740 --> 02:48:07.420]
I forgot what his name was, the forest, right?

[02:48:07.660 --> 02:48:07.860]
Deepo.

[02:48:09.300 --> 02:48:09.660]
Yeah.

[02:48:11.300 --> 02:48:13.400]
Was that Q-I-M or was that I-O-D?

[02:48:13.800 --> 02:48:14.840]
No, that was Q-A-M.

[02:48:14.960 --> 02:48:15.300]
That was Q-A-M.

[02:48:15.300 --> 02:48:17.460]
That was Q-A-M, but they were still called the first team, correct?

[02:48:17.880 --> 02:48:18.760]
The worst team, you know.

[02:48:18.980 --> 02:48:19.620]
Yeah, the worst team.

[02:48:19.700 --> 02:48:20.960]
Well, that's all before our time.

[02:48:21.080 --> 02:48:21.980]
That's way, way back.

[02:48:21.980 --> 02:48:23.020]
That's a lot of stuff.

[02:48:23.020 --> 02:48:26.420]
I can't believe you said Shappy makes me feel really crappy.

[02:48:26.740 --> 02:48:28.980]
You should feel, but it's a long time.

[02:48:29.480 --> 02:48:31.000]
It's all long I've been listening to you, Neil.

[02:48:31.840 --> 02:48:32.160]
Yeah.

[02:48:32.340 --> 02:48:33.760]
All right, buddy.

[02:48:33.960 --> 02:48:34.300]
Take care.

[02:48:34.460 --> 02:48:34.900]
Thanks, Pally.

[02:48:35.220 --> 02:48:35.340]
Yeah.

[02:48:35.640 --> 02:48:38.920]
Did you understand the last thing when he said that's how long I've been listening to what does that kind of thing?

[02:48:38.980 --> 02:48:39.600]
So I didn't hear it.

[02:48:40.160 --> 02:48:40.900]
Well, why not?

[02:48:41.340 --> 02:48:41.900]
I was a-

[02:48:41.900 --> 02:48:43.800]
Are you starting to act crappy because you said Shappy?

[02:48:44.120 --> 02:48:46.200]
I was checking the website to see if I could put that link up there.

[02:48:46.540 --> 02:48:47.660]
Steve Shapiro, he's pretty weak.

[02:48:48.180 --> 02:48:48.860]
Is he still around?

[02:48:49.080 --> 02:48:49.880]
Is Steve Shapiro?

[02:48:50.240 --> 02:48:50.600]
Yeah.

[02:48:50.860 --> 02:48:51.640]
Is he Shapiro?

[02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:52.060]
Who?

[02:48:52.840 --> 02:48:54.640]
Sports guy, sports nerd, very weak.

[02:48:54.820 --> 02:48:55.380]
So during the break?

[02:48:55.920 --> 02:48:56.100]
Yeah.

[02:48:56.400 --> 02:48:57.320]
Something you don't often do.

[02:48:57.420 --> 02:48:59.120]
Look under the poll on the website.

[02:48:59.500 --> 02:48:59.760]
Yes.

[02:49:00.160 --> 02:49:00.660]
And there it is.

[02:49:01.080 --> 02:49:01.520]
Oh, the link?

[02:49:01.780 --> 02:49:03.300]
Well, why can't I do it right now?

[02:49:03.400 --> 02:49:03.900]
Oh, you could do it right now.

[02:49:03.900 --> 02:49:05.420]
You think I'm so kind of a slow poke like that.

[02:49:05.580 --> 02:49:08.260]
My computer skills would astonish you.

[02:49:08.700 --> 02:49:09.400]
Neil's my friend.

[02:49:09.400 --> 02:49:09.780]
Very fine.

[02:49:09.780 --> 02:49:10.240]
Right above there.

[02:49:10.320 --> 02:49:11.160]
What would Jesus do?

[02:49:11.420 --> 02:49:14.260]
He'd probably say, I'm a friend and it says this page cannot be found.

[02:49:14.500 --> 02:49:16.120]
We are adding Jesus to our friends list.

[02:49:16.180 --> 02:49:19.040]
No, no, I just click Neil's My Space and says this page cannot be found.

[02:49:19.040 --> 02:49:19.460]
Uh-oh.

[02:49:19.960 --> 02:49:22.020]
So Eric, it's a work in progress, I guess.

[02:49:22.180 --> 02:49:22.720]
It's the link.

[02:49:22.720 --> 02:49:25.000]
The link is going up, but it's not linked to anything yet.

[02:49:25.300 --> 02:49:27.640]
That's weird because it's just, um, does it work for you?

[02:49:28.040 --> 02:49:30.980]
No, but it should because that's the site.

[02:49:31.120 --> 02:49:34.640]
In other words, it does work for me and it doesn't work for you.

[02:49:34.880 --> 02:49:37.440]
Therefore, it's still Eric can't finish yet, okay?

[02:49:37.880 --> 02:49:39.920]
It says this page cannot be found.

[02:49:39.920 --> 02:49:40.620]
We've all seen that.

[02:49:40.780 --> 02:49:42.300]
How many million times have we said that?

[02:49:42.580 --> 02:49:43.120]
I don't know.

[02:49:43.280 --> 02:49:44.660]
I don't think it's an Eric thing.

[02:49:46.060 --> 02:49:47.120]
WJD, what would you say?

[02:49:47.120 --> 02:49:47.940]
That's just fine.

[02:49:48.020 --> 02:49:50.660]
There was always a, uh, and there's the one that says A-hole.

[02:49:50.960 --> 02:49:51.640]
There you go.

[02:49:51.820 --> 02:49:55.380]
You know, we know what that was all about and I again, I apologize, it's above Al Gore's picture.

[02:49:55.460 --> 02:49:59.180]
Sorry, Al, although, when you come right down, let's see, Neil's My Space.

[02:49:59.200 --> 02:49:59.900]
I click it again.

[02:50:00.060 --> 02:50:01.200]
This page cannot be found.

[02:50:01.300 --> 02:50:02.760]
I know, but the correct address comes up.

[02:50:02.820 --> 02:50:04.160]
So I think it's a problem with My Space.

[02:50:04.180 --> 02:50:06.260]
Maybe it's being flooded or being updated.

[02:50:06.480 --> 02:50:08.300]
Oh, yeah, we're flooding My Space right.

[02:50:08.520 --> 02:50:08.920]
Uh-huh.

[02:50:08.980 --> 02:50:10.620]
Well, you are, you talk about it in particular.

[02:50:10.720 --> 02:50:11.460]
What about me?

[02:50:11.560 --> 02:50:12.440]
116 friends.

[02:50:16.200 --> 02:50:16.840]
116 friends.

[02:50:16.840 --> 02:50:18.540]
There's so many millions of people.

[02:50:18.800 --> 02:50:19.860]
Don't just think I know that.

[02:50:20.080 --> 02:50:21.580]
We still got 116 friends.

[02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:23.680]
We're pumping the crap out of this, man.

[02:50:24.020 --> 02:50:25.860]
And we still got 116 old bean?

[02:50:26.400 --> 02:50:28.060]
Holy cow, we got a lot of work to do.

[02:50:28.400 --> 02:50:31.440]
We got 1129 posts, but out of those, only 16 are friends.

[02:50:31.640 --> 02:50:32.900]
Well, people are going to look at it.

[02:50:33.300 --> 02:50:33.560]
People?

[02:50:33.880 --> 02:50:34.200]
Yes.

[02:50:34.580 --> 02:50:35.220]
What did he just say?

[02:50:35.480 --> 02:50:35.940]
That's what he said.

[02:50:36.460 --> 02:50:37.740]
He said something about peaking through.

[02:50:37.840 --> 02:50:38.400]
Oh, now let's see.

[02:50:38.480 --> 02:50:40.460]
Can we, I guess we can't play that one anymore, either.

[02:50:40.840 --> 02:50:42.140]
Peeping through, I like that bit.

[02:50:42.440 --> 02:50:44.920]
My Space, I just click the thing and Neil's My Space cannot be found.

[02:50:45.220 --> 02:50:45.900]
Nice going, Eric.

[02:50:45.900 --> 02:50:47.060]
You, the man.

[02:50:47.640 --> 02:50:49.160]
So you're saying it's not his fault?

[02:50:49.520 --> 02:50:49.700]
No.

[02:50:50.040 --> 02:50:50.760]
I say.

[02:50:51.240 --> 02:50:53.560]
Because I just try going there the conventional way.

[02:50:53.880 --> 02:50:54.700]
But I just did too.

[02:50:54.820 --> 02:50:55.360]
I have no problem.

[02:50:55.500 --> 02:50:56.240]
I went right through it.

Go through.

[02:53:24.220 --> 02:53:25.160]
Go through.

[02:53:27.400 --> 02:53:29.860]
I think there are three flashlights on the computer.

[02:53:29.860 --> 02:53:30.820]

[02:53:31.840 --> 02:53:32.680]

[02:54:14.520 --> 02:54:14.920]
Oh

[02:54:15.520 --> 02:54:16.900]
Don't want to step on that thing

[02:54:19.060 --> 02:54:23.240]
146 14-02 man-oh-man the end isn't side today and of course George will be back tomorrow

[02:54:23.240 --> 02:54:26.140]
I'll be back on Thursday and then I'll be on somebody not too soon

[02:54:27.120 --> 02:54:32.180]
1138 votes too bad about that fourth of July and really too bad about that Marligny next Thursday, huh?

[02:54:32.940 --> 02:54:34.760]
Don't you think out of field, Billy? No

[02:54:35.340 --> 02:54:42.020]
Tucson, Arizona an empty casket with a military seal discovered in the desert was discarded by a mortuary after the deceased family

[02:54:42.020 --> 02:54:44.900]
He requested that the body be exhumed and cremated authority said

[02:54:44.900 --> 02:54:48.140]
Deputies were called to the desert area near i10 Saturday

[02:54:48.140 --> 02:54:54.760]
After two people playing paintball found the casket which was metallic silver with the S-Armory City on it

[02:54:54.760 --> 02:54:59.320]
forensic investigators then took DNA samples begin efforts to try to find where the casket came from

[02:54:59.320 --> 02:55:04.280]
mortuary employees contacted the authorities yesterday or Sunday after seeing news accounts about the discovery

[02:55:04.280 --> 02:55:08.460]
Why does today seem like Monday to me because it's the first day you're working?

[02:55:08.980 --> 02:55:10.600]
Yeah, and that seems just like Monday

[02:55:11.160 --> 02:55:16.320]
No information was given on who had been buried in the casket if this could have casket who'd house in that casket

[02:55:16.920 --> 02:55:21.240]
One thing we do know that finding at least it puts the lotion in the casket

[02:55:21.240 --> 02:55:27.340]
Deputy Don Barkman a spokeswoman for the Pima County Sheriff's Office said the casket was taken to a landfill after the body was exhumed

[02:55:27.340 --> 02:55:30.880]
in late May someone took it from the landfill and then just dumped it

[02:55:30.880 --> 02:55:33.120]
We wouldn't have to be bad. Why do people get so

[02:55:34.400 --> 02:55:35.280]
Agus on wiki?

[02:55:35.960 --> 02:55:37.680]
It's so wiki about the whole

[02:55:38.840 --> 02:55:42.080]
Retreating people's bodies and all that I just understand that

[02:55:42.080 --> 02:55:48.220]
Well should be dignity for the death. Well, how much dignity is there for like a stiff? You know when you come right down to it?

[02:55:48.220 --> 02:55:52.400]
Right. I guess they don't want it to happen to them. Why? I don't know

[02:55:52.400 --> 02:55:56.880]
That's why you got to get cremated right away. Why do I think my fat body and burn it baby burn baby?

[02:55:57.080 --> 02:56:01.720]
Why not what a grease fire that'll make oh man. Can you imagine all the great stakes you can cook on that?

[02:56:01.800 --> 02:56:02.540]
It burns

[02:56:03.900 --> 02:56:09.300]
I just I think it goes back to the whole concept of not not accepting death, you know, right?

[02:56:09.500 --> 02:56:14.700]
Right. I mean go and dig up a casket so some stiff from like George Washington

[02:56:14.700 --> 02:56:19.340]
Okay, I'm sure that's somewhere you'll find his it's casket right? I'm sure and

[02:56:19.900 --> 02:56:22.960]
Dig it up. What are you going to find in there? I don't know like for example

[02:56:22.960 --> 02:56:25.920]
You saw the old many original one with Gregory Schmeck. Mm-hmm

[02:56:25.920 --> 02:56:33.060]
And you remember how he and the the photographer the freaked out photographer how they went to Italy right and they went to that

[02:56:33.060 --> 02:56:38.500]
Well, what do they call that place not a rectory but the place where all those dying priests are those

[02:56:38.500 --> 02:56:44.680]
You know always like a hospice or something like that a hospice for priests and then he gave him the directions to go to where to

[02:56:44.700 --> 02:56:52.600]
Find the the caskets his his deceased son, right? It turns out was a was an animal. Remember that that's right

[02:56:53.180 --> 02:56:57.340]
And it was nothing but skin and bones in there now. Not to forget the skin just bones, right?

[02:56:57.720 --> 02:57:03.520]
But this could a task it there's a there's a skeleton in your casket and we just just so I don't know

[02:57:03.520 --> 02:57:08.500]
I just don't understand why people get so I mean that's it. You're born and you die and and uh, yeah, that's it

[02:57:08.500 --> 02:57:12.720]
That's the end. Oh no the soul goes to heaven and they're looking down on this right now

[02:57:12.720 --> 02:57:18.780]
No, they're not they're looking at us with what what were their eyes? How do you look with no eyes with no brain?

[02:57:19.080 --> 02:57:23.300]
And of course, that's the kind of people that believe this crap no brain and that's why they're still living

[02:57:23.300 --> 02:57:29.400]
So they'll be right at home in death. You know what I'm saying right? It'll fit right in with God's game plan

[02:57:29.400 --> 02:57:31.920]
Look at that Gilbert raised enough mind to build an entire village

[02:57:32.560 --> 02:57:37.840]
What does that mean or is that Gilbert? Still guilty being at home and I have enough or better than you

[02:57:37.840 --> 02:57:43.020]
Clearly the last thing. Oh Village for the poor and Jamaica is called Barbara's Village. Oh, I see

[02:57:43.020 --> 02:57:49.080]
These are like small-time warren buffets little people who made a difference or saving some desperate people

[02:57:49.080 --> 02:57:53.940]
I'll tell you one thing that be two of the last places that I would send to spend money to save people would be

[02:57:53.940 --> 02:57:57.180]
Jamaica and Sri Lanka kind of rhymes don't it?

[02:57:57.380 --> 02:58:02.200]
Kind of those will be two of the very last places I'd send a dime to with all the respect here

[02:58:02.200 --> 02:58:06.740]
Jamaican friends and dealers only have a friend and he ain't no dealer well

[02:58:06.740 --> 02:58:12.100]
So what do you need him for that? I don't he moved to here get rid of man. He's too much excess baggage

[02:58:12.100 --> 02:58:15.800]
He got rid of himself. Was that it was that the dead one? No, no

[02:58:15.800 --> 02:58:19.900]
He just he moved to Houston. He might as well be dead. Oh, I thought maybe that was the fat one

[02:58:19.900 --> 02:58:24.220]
No, no that that one was probably I don't think there's a lot of fat

[02:58:24.860 --> 02:58:29.840]
Jamaicans are there? I don't think I've ever seen any fat Jamaicans. I'll check and that kind of strange

[02:58:29.840 --> 02:58:34.760]
When you're smoking all of that good weed and it gives you that big appetite all the time now that you mentioned that all about

[02:58:34.760 --> 02:58:38.020]
Huh? Maybe they're spending all their money and we can't afford no talent. That's our thing

[02:58:38.020 --> 02:58:42.020]
Let's find one of our friends on that my my space of way when you get that thing straight nut

[02:58:42.020 --> 02:58:44.660]
Let's find a fat Jamaican listener when that be great

[02:58:45.260 --> 02:58:48.220]
Okay, me or female or something that we're not really too sure what they are

[02:58:48.220 --> 02:58:52.060]
I'm gonna try clicking that thing again because I can't believe that Eric threw up that bad, you know

[02:58:52.060 --> 02:58:57.800]
He's usually pretty good with his stuff. He's a fixinist. Yeah, pretty stupid. What the problem is and we're fizzinist and there it is

[02:58:58.420 --> 02:59:03.340]
See I'm look I know that this man can get the job done believe me

With all the respect to me. Yeah, I'll do the fine job on this but the picture on the right

[02:59:40.320 --> 02:59:45.920]
Where's my picture in the middle of the queue? Yeah, my mouth has been doctored there

[02:59:45.920 --> 02:59:51.280]
You know, I'm saying that the whole picture that's an airbrush rendition that does that's that Bob from excitement did of you

[02:59:51.280 --> 02:59:54.300]
What do you mean by that? That's a painting of you

[02:59:54.300 --> 02:59:58.640]
No, it's not okay. No, that picture is from one of the old

[02:59:59.400 --> 03:00:05.560]
QM cards and telling right the old QS cards that Bob from excitement took and made an airbrush painting of you

[03:00:05.560 --> 03:00:11.040]
He made a painting of me. That's a painting. You want to believe me? My lips big. He's probably seen them

[03:00:11.040 --> 03:00:17.220]
Look, I had a stroke you have I think of it. I don't want to like poo poo his work there, but just like Joyce was saying poo poo poo

[03:00:17.220 --> 03:00:18.540]
