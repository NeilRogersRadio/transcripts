[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620]
It's dangerous, Miami town

[00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.340]
Birds have five six old WQA

[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.820]
We want the world for me and Jerk

[00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.800]
We'll punch your grass, boom, be a man

[00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.800]
The willy huts of fests and everything

[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.780]
And y'all, they come into America

[00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.000]
Cut your bones and or make your dreams

[00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.480]
Then watch your cars

[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.060]
Try and do it for me and the gracious star

[00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.200]
And for the half and half and half

[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.420]
Don't stop it man

[00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.520]
Oh!

[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.220]
Are you the way they do all the jobs

[00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.180]
Where you want them all to get paid

[00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.360]
And you've got the road to

[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.300]
We should shift them all down the average

[00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.620]
Let them go and win the chain

[00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.980]
Yeah!

[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.540]
Call your own daughter, you need your own beauty star

[00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.760]
The willy huts of grass, the indresser's drugs

[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.640]
They come into America to do our shows

[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.160]
I don't know the smell of the fun

[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.900]
All they want to do is laundry clean and dust

[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.780]
They're water, and there's no stopping them

[00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.520]
Let me look in for the American dreams

[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.180]
That's why they started to win the string

[00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.900]
Go ahead and give them all the pizza

[00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.700]
Let them go and win the common pizza

[00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.100]
I think you'll hear

[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.280]
Yeah!

[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.940]
You know what's like with like, if you took your whole family

[00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.240]
And you went to Disney World for the weekend or something

[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.160]
And you came back on Sunday night

[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.840]
And there was a whole bunch of Mexicans in your house

[00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.720]
Yeah, and you said, what the hell are you doing here?

[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.640]
And I said, we just moved in

[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.340]
Right, and we took out your garbage and we washed the dishes

[00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.980]
And we dusted for cheap

[00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.780]
And we're going to move the lawn Monday morning

[00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.440]
And we're going to all these things for next to nothing

[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.400]
And you said, yeah, get out of here, you don't belong here

[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.920]
This is my house, and they said, how dare you do that?

[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.420]
Yeah, who do you think you are?

[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.080]
What's the rights?

[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.840]
Yeah, we demand that, but it'll be pitiful

[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.080]
There's this whole thing today

[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.100]
I say, let's boycott QA and today

[00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.540]
What?

[00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:32.400]
Look, it ain't going to work

[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.560]
It's boycott day, oh I'm just, I'm going to go back to bed

[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.040]
My ears are still plugged up, I got the ass end of the flu

[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.960]
And I do mean the ass end

[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:40.580]
Yeah

[00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.560]
I just got the flu, my ears are still plugged up, bad

[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.300]
And just a whole general ambiance to this place

[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.320]
Tomorrow morning, the ratings will be, I love in 30 in the morning

[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.020]
Man, that should be a real fly opener

[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.900]
Wow, there'll be a run, yeah

[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.000]
In fact, let me just give you some advice right now

[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.020]
You know, because if you don't want to repeat that experience yet

[00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.960]
A few weeks ago, remember when you couldn't get in the tea room?

[00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.280]
Oh, yeah

[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.580]
There'll be a line for that magic room

[00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.180]
From there all the way to Jacksonville, I'm telling you

[00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.280]
I'll bring you a bucket

[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.340]
They will be

[00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.780]
Now, why the hell are we got calls on here already?

[00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.020]
W-Q-I-M, hello?

[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.700]
Hello!

[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.760]
See, he's just getting boring to me at this point

[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.860]
You're boring, okay?

[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.340]
Yeah, he's been boring for years, but you're so ponderous

[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.400]
W-Q-I-M, hello?

[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.380]
See, there's nobody on that one either

[00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.980]
And probably calling in for the latest draft information

[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.340]
Maybe that's what I got, maybe I got a draft

[00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.540]
Maybe that's how I got the flu

[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.940]
Did we really run a Orlando tape interview again with the number one draft pick?

[00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.060]
Did we ran again there?

[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.140]
Did we have to go play golf?

[00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.460]
Yes

[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.740]
It's just, you know what it is?

[00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.720]
It's unacceptable as what it is

[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.880]
But there's new regime we got, man, they are just scared of their own shadow

[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.600]
W-Q-I-M, hello?

[00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.660]
No, that one ain't gonna work.

[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:46.460]
Q-I-M, hello?

[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:47.160]
Hey, Neil

[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.780]
Yes

[00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.180]
Sounds to me like you're fading fast

[00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.820]
I want to apologize to the dead Bobby Daron

[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.480]
So I'm on biography last night and for years I've been saying

[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.560]
How did I drink, Bobby?

[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.840]
And because I always thought he'd died

[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.120]
Because he would have had a drinking problem

[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.720]
Sandra D who was married to Bobby Daron

[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.140]
She had a drinking problem and they were divorced as a result of that

[00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.200]
And many other reasons, whatever

[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.960]
But he didn't have a drinking problem

[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.100]
He had a heart problem, he was born with it

[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.300]
And the doctors didn't expect he was gonna live till...

[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.640]
But he did

[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.780]
But he did

[00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.280]
And then it just finally had that was the end, you know what I'm saying?

[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.140]
You own apology, quick picking on dead people

[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.380]
I'm sorry, bad style

[00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.860]
He's a sharp, big guy

[00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.160]
Anyway, he's still dead, nobody cares

[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.980]
Now take a look at this, this is really something to be honest

[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.220]
And the first of May, these probably are all the illegals calling in

[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.640]
WCWIM, hola

[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.080]
Good morning Neil, how are you?

[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.740]
Okay

[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.100]
Hey, quick questions, give a few more people

[00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.020]
Stay home, the traffic's great out here

[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.480]
Okay, oh, WCWIM, hello?

[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.920]
All you illegals, okay, stay home

[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.180]
See this idea that you're gonna say thank you to America for letting your sneakier ask in

[00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.640]
by shutting down business and costing people economically

[00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.560]
That's a really good way to do it, slap in the face

[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.820]
That's what it sounds like to me

[00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.500]
A slap in the face to the country that you sneak in

[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.440]
I think it's a good idea, so we know who we don't need

[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.300]
I said the other day, there's no, you know, they're not gonna deport anybody

[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.740]
So there's no solution once, you know, the cat's out of the bag

[00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.140]
But at least, scared and forcing the law right now

[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.520]
The mission's shown a big fat spotlight on a country that can't protect its own borders

[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.960]
And I've been saying that for 20, almost 30 years

[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.980]
Not 30, man

[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.180]
That's right, by the way, Fuddy's gone, we'll get to that

[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.840]
Got some really heavy duty or radio news, that's Fuddy

[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.240]
Yeah, you would have thought it was Fuddy's the way they were reporting it

[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.400]
You were the thought so, WCWIM, hello?

[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.860]
QYM, illegal alien line, QYM, hello?

[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.420]
Fuddy's leaving, why won't I?

[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.780]
No, we know that, just got to say that, okay?

[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.920]
I just got to say that, okay?

[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.600]
Maybe we got some mom 100 jingles, but I don't think so

[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:50.580]
Idiot

[00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.520]
Oh, this is like a sequel to Thursday, remember?

[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.620]
Wow, holy moly, this is really going to be good for my last show

[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.580]
So many QYM, hello?

[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.000]
Neil

[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:02.080]
Yes, sir

[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.940]
Have you known the chance to see the new movie in 1993?

[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.780]
No, I wouldn't watch that if he paid me by the minute

[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.420]
You wouldn't want to see it, it's too much

[00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.560]
I gotta tell you, it's very, very upsetting

[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.420]
And anyway, I'm going to go back

[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.640]
What's most upsetting is that it's mostly fiction, because they don't have a damn clue what was going on in their plane

[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:24.160]
They had a guy on the plane, they had a student have a fake bomb, and they beat the crap out of him

[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.000]
And, well, nobody remembers what happened, but anyway

[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.960]
Hey, that's what I just got to say, nobody knows what happened, I'm not really big on, you know

[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.600]
Movies that are loosely based on it, although I did see a really interesting documentary on the

[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.800]
The Health Channel, is it a documentary channel over the weekend about the Kennedy assassination?

[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.560]
Yep

[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.660]
New information?

[00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:50.160]
No, I was just, you know, just kind of like reinforced the fact that we don't really know, but probably never will know, but

[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.040]
Anybody believes Oswald done it?

[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.660]
My Oswald said the dog done it, I think maybe the dog done it

[00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.140]
W and Q and I am, hello?

[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.260]
These people are whipped up into an apoplectic frenzy there, like it, Q and I am

[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.460]
Yeah, I'm my friend

[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.800]
W and Q and I am, hello

[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.100]
Hi, Rady, can I switch?

[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.320]
Q and I am, hello?

[00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.000]
And that Miguel

[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.900]
Yeah, okay

[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.260]
Here's line 9, here's the Eddie line

[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.240]
Hola, he's part of the show

[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.180]
Yeah, he's part of the show, huh?

[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.980]
We got your show right over here, okay?

[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.360]
It's called Cho and Tell

[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:28.700]
By the way, George came up with a good idea, B-B-G-I stands for Banjo Boy Group Incorporated

[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.320]
Or could the Beener Boy Incorporated, but I think that sees a history

[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.920]
Oh yeah, that could have just been him

[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.880]
That was a good run we just had there, we haven't had a run like this

[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.760]
Haven't had the runs like that since yesterday

[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.100]
It's part of getting rid of the flu, let me just tell you right now

[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.080]
When you got the flu and you have a wild experience like that

[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.860]
Not only is it good on the scale, but it's also really good getting

[00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.500]
And getting out what else you know what I'm saying?

[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.680]
Or your system, it's good purge

[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.840]
Oh yeah, purge, that's what we need to QA him as a big purge

[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.380]
Well, I'm going to go play golf now, so it's been a lot of fun being with you

[00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:02.800]
But I just, I don't get what's going on this during, I see Gellie all over the place

[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.120]
I think these people are trying like a set of message

[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.180]
Remember Joey Zaza was going to send a message right?

[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.600]
I think these people are sending a message like I told you

[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.400]
Waving at White Hanky after Wendu I mentioned there a couple weeks ago, they just got around to it

[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.100]
Thank you, power

[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.520]
WQA M, hello

[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.740]
QA M, Ola

[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.360]
You're good

[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.140]
Yeah, okay, thanks for the bulletin

[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.260]
WQA M, hello

[00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:27.680]
Hi, sir

[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.240]
567 or 560, let's just take calls all day

[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.500]
I'm in the mood for it, man, we're off to such a good start

[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.020]
That was bad form, shouldn't have done it

[00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:38.920]
Was it solid?

[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.940]
No, it was not, we just like, uh, mung

[00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:45.280]
In fact, I thought it was going to be good, but it's not

[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:52.040]
567 or 560, so there's the usual 6-read card, we got them, I was going to say, out of the way, we got them for the beginning

[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.620]
Well, the word, over the day, huh?

[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:54.920]
The word, I know that

[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.740]
Here's the poll result from over the weekend

[00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:06.180]
And by the way, we never had one person called in on Friday, not one, not even one, to tell us about the great Renaissance in downtown Miami

[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.580]
So this poll is a little bit vegetative as far as I'm concerned

[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:13.320]
2050 votes, what's your take on downtown Miami?

[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:14.880]
Date counties of foreign country

[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.700]
Absolutely

[00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:19.220]
867, over 40%, 42.2

[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.600]
It sucks, don't go there, 527, that's another almost 26%

[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.940]
It's making a great comeback, 270, anybody buying it?

[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:27.100]
No

[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.620]
Anybody can verify that or tell us how or why?

[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:29.880]
No

[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.560]
It's become a tourist trap selling a lot of overpriced crap, 98

[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:41.280]
Never been there, 93. You're out of touch, Neil, 82. Interestingly, 4%, the same 4% we had all consistently all the way through.

[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.420]
You're out of touch, and you know what I say?

[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.860]
Thank Lord, thank God, thank God

[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:51.200]
I hate this poll 74, and downtown Miami is paradise, only 39

[00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:57.040]
I wouldn't know, haven't been there in a long, long time

[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:03.580]
Since the last time I went to a Panthers game in downtown Miami, and that's got to be what? Like nine years ago, 10 years, something like that?

[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.100]
You tell me

[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:10.580]
Have you ever in your life, it's been a long time since we've seen such an effusive outpouring of hysteria

[00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:14.960]
This is almost like aliens coming back by the way, you see what I'm saying?

[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:15.520]
Yeah

[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:21.700]
That's the last time that we ever had this kind of a foaming at the moment in the phone, I just barely sat my ass down here

[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:22.960]
Maybe one of them will be a real call

[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:27.880]
In fact, maybe this is probably a good idea, we dumped that stupid ass crossover, I think we ought to get rid of that thing

[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.840]
But let's just stop doing that

[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.980]
Send the message along to a Hank's people, we're just not going to do that no more

[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:39.220]
He's just got too many outside the activities going on, QAM always comes like about 10th on the list, you know?

[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.240]
It's way down the list of priorities

[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.200]
So see, this is my number one priority because this is where I make all my money

[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:48.660]
So as far as employment is concerned, this is my only priority, follow what I'm saying?

[00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.420]
Yeah, maybe you need more earns in the far

[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:54.160]
No, I don't want any more irons in the far, this is a lot of fire for me

[00:10:54.160 --> 00:11:00.560]
About minutes after 10 at 5.60, let me say it again, Bobby Daron was not a drunk, he was a good-upstanding guy

[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.740]
Good boy

[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.980]
With a bad hair piece, too, by the way, I learned bad about it, he had a real bad piece

[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.660]
Give me life, I'm hoping to trade

[00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:13.540]
Between love, I will come my way

[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.240]
But he still did

[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:19.540]

This is Neal Rogers, this is 5.16 QA

[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.220]
No way

[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.280]
No way

[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.940]
QA, why has you seen A&S?

[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:33.680]
White House images, rightful, and the VADR is rightful

[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.300]
Two convinces of polls aren't low

[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.480]
Tony Snow, Tony Snow, Tony Snow, Tony Snow

[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.360]
Oh right, oh it's hot so host is shopping

[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.420]
So the reds are red, he's shopping

[00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:48.640]
When you want your leadership to go

[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.340]
Tony Snow, Tony Snow, where is your home?

[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.420]
People totally hold bush tight

[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.180]
Tony's called him bad name before

[00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.340]
But if you need a man who eats hard brides

[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.740]
Tony Snow, he's your home

[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:06.460]
Oh bush, thanks of these suit permative

[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.440]
And his views are quiet and servative

[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.280]
Smart move to higher hand, we don't know

[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:15.220]
Tony Snow, Tony Snow, Tony Snow

[00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.660]
Tony Snow, Tony Snow, Tony Snow

[00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:22.700]
Tony Snow, Tony Snow, Tony Snow

[00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.060]
Tony Snow, Tony Snow, Tony Snow, Tony Snow

[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:26.780]
Tony Snow, Tony Snow, Tony Snow, Tony Snow

[00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:32.400]
Tony Snow, Tony Snow, Tony Snow, Tony Snow

[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:41.580]
Tony Snow, Tony Snow, Tony Snow, Tony Snow

[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:44.760]
Marlins on decades, 30, those red hot Marlins man

[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.680]
They probably released some mokin baby

[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.900]
They are at least their consistent

[00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.700]
What is it now? 5 and 15 is that going to be about right?

[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:51.700]
6 and 16

[00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.500]
Oh, 6 excuse me, I missed that last one

[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.860]
You have to buy it if you're going to

[00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:56.840]
But they're the 6's

[00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:57.920]
Yeah, 6 and 16

[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.040]
That is just pathetic

[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.040]
Anyway, they're right

[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.600]
And I noticed that they had floppy head nut on Friday at the ballpark

[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.760]
But even the Eschnore is out there to enjoy for that

[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:07.280]
Yeah

[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.580]
Must be all the illegal aliens were practicing boycotting

[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:13.080]
Or something like that because it was announced crowd at 10,000

[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.900]
And if there were like 6,000, 7,000

[00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:16.720]
That was a lot, even for the old floppy head

[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.740]
So even the giveaways aren't drawn now

[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.140]
David, I hate to break the news to you, not going to get no stadium

[00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:23.960]
Yeah, we want to win, we want to be stadium

[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.360]
Yeah, well guess what, you're nobody cares

[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.200]
Marlins in the Phillies, I'm assuming that's a home game?

[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:30.080]
Yes it is

[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.620]
At 705, they're not, I'm sure it would be a fantastic turn out for that game

[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:39.520]
And then 80k follows Marlins baseball, which is like following tapes of the bigo interviewing some draft choice

[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:40.580]
A death wish

[00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:42.260]
Okay, let's take a look at the poll now

[00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.500]
I got news for you Mr. Clara Bell

[00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:46.980]
You guys are just playing fast and loose with a multi-

[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:50.920]
Well there's George Poonie, you know something, he and his dad were on TV all weekend long

[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:56.440]
And they made the visit to Darfur and we're talking about the first genocide of the 21st century

[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.620]
And they're doing a lot of great things and he still bugs me, I just can't stand looking at it

[00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:01.220]
I don't know what it is, he just bothers me

[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:02.920]
The way he cocks his head sideways when he tells me

[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:03.420]
Is that what it is?

[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.880]
Like a bird or dog

[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.440]
No, a bird or a bird

[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.120]
Well dogs do that for high-pitched sounds, I heard do that all the time

[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.460]
Anyway, he just irritates me

[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:14.800]
I know, I know, he's very on the right side politically

[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.720]
I mean on the left side and all the stuff and he just bugs me

[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.580]
Here's our poll today, the star-spangled banner should be sung

[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.480]
694 vote already, we'll make that 1000 easy

[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.780]
Easy, even after I leave to play golf

[00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:29.760]
In English only 423 in English

[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:30.900]
Solemente, okay?

[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.060]
Solemente in English 423

[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:34.620]
60% plus

[00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:37.700]
Rarely, it's a bad song, that's the correct answer obviously

[00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.500]
It's a horrible song, 114

[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:43.820]
Most people don't know the lyrics and it's just a Honduras and it goes about a holiday

[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:44.760]
Can you see there?

[00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:45.040]
Yeah

[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:48.260]
In any language, 93

[00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.960]
Who gives a schmutz 61? That's a very good choice

[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.500]
In English or Spanish, Solomon Teocho

[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.760]
Only 8 people say English or Spanish

[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.880]
See that? And I hate this poll too

[00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:58.720]
Big should be in Pigland

[00:15:59.440 --> 00:15:59.920]
701

[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:03.580]
This is the latest, let's get everybody whipped up to Yuri

[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:05.420]
You know about what language should we speak?

[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.540]
And so we'll hop on, we'll bite

[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.800]
Speaking of biting, I hear a footy of weaving a while 100s, why I heard

[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.180]
I am

[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:16.920]
Better get some of these calls on though, I want to get really call intensive this week

[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.880]
Because we got the book coming 1130 tomorrow morning

[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:22.080]
And we'll have to dissect that and chew it up and spit it out

[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.420]
I think mostly spitting it out

[00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:24.840]
That's spitting I said

[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:26.360]
WDQYM Hello

[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:28.220]
This is a crazy man

[00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:29.780]
WDQYM Hello

[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.680]
You can go Andy and Camerader

[00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:33.260]
721, hello

[00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.260]
Yeah, yeah

[00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:36.280]
Yeah

[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:40.880]
Hey, I want to call you about two weeks ago to talk about a subject where

[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:45.740]
The news came out that Bush had released the information about Valerie Plain

[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:49.300]
And then, insanely, although it's a Bush administration

[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:54.780]
And Fox News released information that they were going to use nuclear weapons on the Iranians

[00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:57.280]
For their nuclear program

[00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.560]
I just wonder if anybody brought that up

[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:04.500]
And I feel that they released that to kind of take away attention from the Valerie Plain thing

[00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.400]
So, let's nuke Iran deal

[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.120]
Well, they like changing the subject

[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:13.500]
Now of course the fact that we got all the important stuff going on

[00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:15.580]
Like the chicken of Rubi, you know

[00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:18.300]
Well, you know, in closing meal

[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:20.820]
I think they stole the election

[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.220]
WDQYM Hello

[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:26.780]
How can I hang in your back?

[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:28.820]
WDQYM Hello

[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:33.380]
If they always take a good deep breath always helps, okay?

[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.720]
Yeah, take that deep breath like a vacuum cleaner like a Kirby vacuum cleaner

[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.700]
Because most of these call so far have sucked big time

[00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:42.260]
WDQYM Hello

[00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:43.720]
Hey, how you doing, Tally?

[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:45.500]
Can I ask you a question?

[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.280]
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute

[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:51.400]
What is with this everybody who's called who hasn't been just an idiot has asked a question

[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.240]
This isn't 20 questions, what are you guys?

[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.560]
What would you like to say?

[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:59.400]
Well, I'd like to ask you what is the related, I know they sound leaders but what are you paying in Canada?

[00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.420]
I know if you're driving up there but what is the relationship the course of

[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:03.920]
So, Rubi, what about the gallon?

[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.260]
All right, so it's all relative then

[00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:08.480]
What do you want me to find us, do you?

[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:09.520]
No, I do not

[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.580]
Okay, because it's getting really ponderous at this point

[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.120]
Okay, well I'm glad to hear that

[00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.840]
Oh my god, it's been over four bucks a gallon for quite some time

[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.700]
In fact, it used to be like it's expensive

[00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:23.620]
And that's one of the reasons, one of the main reasons I don't have no car here

[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:26.640]
What though I want to maintain a car here and spend four bucks a gallon for gas

[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:30.600]
Although when I go out and play golf in about 10 minutes, I probably wish I had that car

[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:34.920]
And what though is this that somebody's, oh record, price low for B-B-G-I

[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:38.260]
For Banjo Boy Group Bank, look at that somebody just packed in

[00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:39.960]
Thanks for the good news, woo!

[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.720]
Take a puke at that

[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:46.820]
Down to 6.7, 25 B-B-G-I

[00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:52.300]
Oh, wow, what is it now?

[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:57.280]
It's 9.25, says record, price low for B-B-G-I

[00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.780]
And deservedly so by the way

[00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:00.860]
These people are just unbelievable

[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:03.640]
They drag their heels and drag their feet on everything

[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.140]
And blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.700]
Just like George and Josh's new deals, how are those coming?

[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.720]
Guys, I think they're fermenting

[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.420]
They're fermenting

[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:15.260]
They've got it over there and they're still, you know, that's right

[00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.540]
Yeah, they've got to still up in the heel over here and there

[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:19.600]
That's correct

[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.300]
And how about Josh, how's your thing? Is it sign seal delivered?

[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:26.260]
Not sign and sealed, but delivered, I'm told

[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:27.760]
Yeah, it's good to go

[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.620]
But everything's fermenting over there on the west coast

[00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.540]
Perkulate, it's very spectacular

[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:35.160]
Just like your morning coffee, it's percolating over there

[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.440]
Just like Maxwell House coffee

[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:38.180]
That's it

[00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:40.440]
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop

[00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:41.340]
Wow

[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.280]
It is just, you know, something tomorrow morning at 11.30

[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.800]
We got the winter book coming out

[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:50.100]
And I think people are going to reap the windfall of their incompetence

[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.060]
I think it's going to be just astonishing

[00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:54.380]
I think we may have to strap ourselves in

[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:56.020]
WDQYM, hello

[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:57.280]
Hello

[00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.200]
Yes, sir

[00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.660]
Yeah, can I talk to Neil?

[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:00.420]
Speaking

[00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:01.540]
Hello

[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.380]
Let me say again, speaking

[00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:04.020]
Take it here

[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.340]
Neil, first of all, I got something to tell you, man

[00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:07.920]
Yeah

[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.920]
First, I want to tell George

[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.680]
He showed very much disrespect for showing up to work

[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.300]
Yeah, yeah

[00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:17.080]
And number two

[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:17.460]
Uh-huh

[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.000]
Rest of the crane call

[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.820]
How many QAM, hello

[00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.940]
Did you hear Neil, read in QAM to go play golf?

[00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:26.500]
First of all, George isn't an illegal alien

[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:27.160]
How do you like that?

[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:28.780]
So that's why he showed up to work today

[00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:30.480]
Only the illegals are not showing up to work

[00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:34.000]
It's a great way to say thank you, America, for letting me sneak in here

[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.180]
Across the border and coming in

[00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:37.360]
I know that we know who all the people are

[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.460]
Stop, uh-

[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.020]
No, that's not the point. The point is this is a slap in the face

[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:41.320]
Sure

[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.200]
It's not- it's not just it's disgusting

[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.560]
And when you break into somebody's country, just like breaking into somebody's house

[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.460]
Like I used to be a comparison before

[00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.380]
You don't start making demands, okay?

[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:51.600]
I demand this, right?

[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.340]
And I demand that, your mom, okay?

[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.000]
Get lost, go back and mow the lawn, get out of my face

[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.240]
And the businesses that are closed, those are the ones that are hiring those illegals

[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.100]
That is they are

[00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:01.880]
So you know who to avoid in the future now

[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:02.360]
Yeah

[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.440]
Because those people that are hiring illegal aliens

[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.760]
Because they are a bunch of grave robbers

[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:06.960]
Right

[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.380]
Those are the ones who perpetuate the problem

[00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:09.180]
Because they are the indigenous

[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:10.620]
They set out the message, okay?

[00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:11.060]
They are the enabled

[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.400]
They set up a number of risk their lives and come across the border

[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.660]
So they can get these jobs

[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:16.240]
That's right, they belong in jail

[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.900]
I say to Vicente Fox, you crook, you gangster you

[00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:22.420]
If things lie in Mexico, if people actually have a chance for a decent life there

[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:24.860]
People wouldn't be risking their lives to come across the border

[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.140]
They don't allow illegals to go into Mexico

[00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:28.160]
That is correct

[00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:30.660]
So I say, boycott Vicente Fox

[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:31.480]
That's what I say

[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.140]
And don't need any burritos today

[00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:35.440]
Just pay back as a bitch

[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.940]
Don't need any burritos and certainly don't need no case ideas

[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:38.780]
All right

[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.900]
All the way I do like a nice case idea

[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.160]
Chicken case idea is pretty good

[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.660]
I had to say case idea yesterday

[00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:44.100]
Mmm

[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:44.940]
That's it

[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.340]

This is 5.62.8

[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:10.540]
Disgusting program! I urge everyone to complain to this station

[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:11.140]
Absolutely

[00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.700]
Hey, you're doing great! You're shouting to help me quiet

[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.400]
Hey, shut the world, hey baby

[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.860]
Hey, I love you, Tom

[00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:21.020]
I love you, Shoe Baby, but just stay quiet, okay?

[00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:26.660]
I said quiet, you're not deaf with any more of your sign colleges, you know it hurts

[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:28.840]
Come in, I love you

[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.440]
Okay, I know you want me to be quiet

[00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:35.100]
I said quiet, I get shut up!

[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.440]
I told you to shut up, I didn't want to have to do this

[00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:45.620]
I said shut up!

[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:51.180]
Oh my God

[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:54.920]
1032-560-3QAM

[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.840]
Well, I'll teach that bitch to make all that noise

[00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:57.680]
That's right

[00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:00.020]
She got a dummy up while he's eating a placenta

[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:01.580]
Oh, man

[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:06.280]
But this just in breaking news, man breaking news, big news

[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:12.520]
The Supreme Court rule today that one time stripper in Playboy Playmate Annanacole Smith could pursue part of her late husband's oil fortune

[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.860]
They said, you go, girl

[00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:19.360]
Justice has gave New Legal Impetus to Smith's bid to collect millions of dollars from the estate of J. Howard Marshall in a second

[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.820]
Her late husband's estate has been estimated as much as 1.6 billion

[00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:24.380]
I'll take a little piece of that, please

[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:28.540]
That's what Tom said to him when he looked at Annanacole

[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:30.000]
So how do you get the piece of that?

[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:30.780]
I need to go around

[00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:32.920]
So let me just look up her dress one time

[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:38.320]
Smith has been embroiled in a long running cross country fight along with Marshall's youngest son, E. Pierce Marshall

[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:42.160]
The court's decision which was unanimous means that it will not end anytime soon

[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:47.500]
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg writing for the court said Smith should have a fresh chance to pursue claims in federal court

[00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:51.120]
Dressed in all black, the former stripper wept in the courtroom late in late February

[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:55.160]
As Justice has discussed Marshall and mother's he had intended to provide for her in death

[00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:59.500]
Once she arrived at the court several photographers were knocked to the ground and escuffled her to take photos

[00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.600]
It would not to the ground, they paparazzi

[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:04.560]
WQYM, hello

[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:04.940]
Leo

[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:05.780]
Yes sir

[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:07.020]
I got a question for you

[00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:08.340]
Another question, yeah

[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:10.100]
No more questions, man

[00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:11.200]
No more questions, man

[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.500]
Alright, I come in, I come in, Leo

[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:14.580]
George should not be at work

[00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:15.800]
He is the punk

[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.500]
He is the grotto and protest

[00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:18.740]
He is the star

[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:19.720]
What is he going to protest?

[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:20.780]
Everybody calls this guy going to make

[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:22.080]
Yeah, what is he going to protest?

[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.580]
The immigration policy, the Bush administration

[00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:27.920]
And what policy is that?

[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.680]
Your policy at all

[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:30.300]
Uh-huh

[00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:33.620]
Well, let me ask you something, where are you calling me from a cell phone?

[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:34.140]
No

[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:35.740]
Well, where are you right now?

[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:36.820]
I'm in Fort Boydale

[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:40.140]
Well, I'm not talking about what city I'm talking about, where are you in a building?

[00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:42.240]
Well, I'm away to the protest now

[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.880]
Yeah, well, good, good, good, busy, yeah

[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.420]
I found a way to protest my ass

[00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:46.340]
I'm bringing the gas on the floor

[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:47.340]
It's so full of it

[00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:53.640]
Protests, you know, they had 300,000 people protesting against the war and all the bloodshed in New York on over the weekend

[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.200]
And these St. Lawrence that are out there today, that's what they ought to be protesting

[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:02.800]
Almost 3,000 Americans that, you know, the best estimate is 180,000 wounded

[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:06.780]
180,000 is what is the number they put on and not wounded

[00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:09.240]
I mean, that's 100, I mean, 18,000

[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.900]
Well, it would be pretty soon, it'll be 180, 18,000

[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:16.020]
And these idiots, oh, you ought to be out there protesting what?

[00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:18.060]
That's not what these people are protesting

[00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:21.060]
They're not protesting the fact this government don't have it in immigration policy

[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:27.660]
These are a bunch of beeners out there protesting the fact that, you know, we're not going to give them some kind of special status

[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:31.940]
May it wave that magic wand and say, okay, you're Americans now, repeat after me

[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:35.260]
I pledge allegiance by Ruchata, Yuskid al-Biyah

[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:36.300]
Wow

[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:41.680]
You know, I have a feeling that the people across the street, I've got a piece of advice for them

[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:45.440]
And if the Democrats were smart, they'd take the same advice, okay?

[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:46.560]
Don't do anything

[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:47.260]
Yeah

[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:49.340]
Just sit back, no, listen, you're right

[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:53.860]
Democrats need to just sit back and let the Republicans implode, self-destruct, because that's what they're doing

[00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:55.880]
And the same thing for the people across the street

[00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:00.880]
Don't make any rash moves, just sit back and fumble your incompetent way along, put this will on the ear

[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.300]
And you'll be okay, it's coast-along

[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:07.180]
Just coast-along, that's right, because this place is imploding

[00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:11.980]
Every single morning that I sit down here, there are new and shocking development

[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:15.160]
None of them good, by the way, not a single one of them good

[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:18.940]
And it's just amazing to me, and of course today is the first of May

[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:22.080]
Which means El Sincuida Mairos coming up on Friday

[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:24.900]
Now you're going to be working on Sincuida Mairo?

[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:25.180]
Punk

[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:31.340]
But tell us around with you, man, you've got to be in solidarity with your Hispanic brethren

[00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:34.880]
Right, right, hey, just sit my ancestors, rates of people, doesn't make us brothers

[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.580]
Yeah, yeah, right, an audio-marti

[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:40.900]
I'll have a mark, I mean, it's in it, Andy Garcia's making another Cuba movie

[00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:43.660]
He's more obsessed than your buddy Miguel there, just obsessed

[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:49.040]
It was Cuba, Cuba, I think he's also trying to exploit Godfather too

[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:54.500]
Because it's about the mafia and the casino is in this and that, but it would be put in all this other crap

[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:58.180]
I wonder if they're going to talk about how the fact that the T-Ce was being paid off by all the monsters

[00:27:58.180 --> 00:27:58.800]
What's hope?

[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:02.080]
Which is why they had the casinos there in the first place, I doubt it

[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:02.400]
Michael?

[00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:07.120]
No, he's going to be talking mostly about alien and meriscretia as and the Miami family

[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.440]
And all that, a lot of great chapter

[00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:10.260]
WQAM, hello

[00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:10.600]
Neil

[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:11.460]
Yes, sir

[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:12.720]
One question for you

[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.680]
No more, no more questions, all done with questions

[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.740]
If you start your call by saying I got a question, you are history

[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:23.020]
You are gone, just like magic, just like that

[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.860]
Speaking of gone, footy

[00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:27.440]
The legendary software, what is that legendary?

[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.460]
I mean, legendary My Ass

[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:30.280]
Yeah

[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:32.240]
Where did legendary and whose mind?

[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:35.200]
This isn't a herald by the way, so I take it with four greens of salt

[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:39.380]
I don't know about you, but are you having, well of course you don't probably read the Sun Sentinel online

[00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:40.680]
I don't

[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:46.560]
But I just, I can't, they're having problems with their website and it can't be me because it's the only website I have problems with

[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:49.320]
The only one, maybe Josh can explain that to me

[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:52.220]
Well, I have no problem with it, so it is you

[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:54.360]
Well, but how is that possible, why would that be?

[00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:57.220]
I have no idea, I read it every morning and I just went to it right now

[00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:58.840]
Really? Maybe they're watching the Canadian

[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.240]
Well, let's see, let me do it right now

[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:02.160]
Do it

[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:05.160]
Uh, okay, SunSendle.com

[00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:06.820]
Can that

[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:10.720]
Anyway, can that too

[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.400]
Okay, there's the match head, there's the top part

[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:16.360]
And the rest of it, I wait and I wait and I wait

[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:18.660]
And I wait, the rest of the main page

[00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:24.320]
And I'm waiting and I'm waiting and I'm waiting and waiting and the little thing is, uh, nothing's happened

[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.620]
And then eventually it will finally will open

[00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:30.240]
And then you'll click on a story that you might want to get to the story and nothing happens

[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:34.300]
And then even I went to Firefox and I do the same thing, this has been going on for about five days now

[00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:38.360]
Well, there it is, former USF professor to be deported after one and a half years in prison

[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:44.280]
A judge today sentenced former professor Sammy Allaryan to another year and a half in prison before he'll be deported in his terrorism

[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.960]
That's the Ashmukh Rover in Tampa, remember USF?

[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:47.320]
Right

[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.920]
Dolphins Taylor stabbed in the road rage incident

[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:55.660]
Dolphins defensive and outside linebacker Jason Taylor was stabbed last night in the roadside incident in his debut home

[00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:56.320]
He's okay though

[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.640]
Now let's see if I click on, oh and look at that!

[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:01.740]
Oh, something's going on here, now all of a sudden it comes up

[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:03.140]
Hmm, I think Tom Jikker

[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:06.420]
I think Tom Jikker just took the hold off on my computer

[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:06.920]
He had a problem

[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:09.120]
He put a wicked spell on there, Canadian filter

[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:10.520]
Yeah, that's it

[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:13.180]
Well, I tell you Dolphins, man, they got Soros

[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:15.760]
Because, I think, got these culpapers

[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:21.860]
Not always, you got a real crappy attitude, but he's also got a bad knee and he's injured and he ain't going to be playable to play the first half of the season

[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:24.520]
And now they didn't want to get in Joey Harrington, did they?

[00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:25.700]
Well, not yet

[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:27.360]
Oh, I sure hope they do

[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:29.360]
Because he really sucks

[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.740]
He is bad

[00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:33.120]
He'll make them long for AJ Tussi-Fili

[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.480]
That's how bad he is, he is pathetic

[00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:37.240]
He'd be bad

[00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:39.980]
So basically they don't have any quarterback now

[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:42.060]
No, they have some Terry Burger that I've never heard of

[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:45.120]
They have somebody that they mentioned, I saw about four minutes of the draft year over the weekend

[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:46.680]
And I didn't even know who he is

[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.140]
And nobody ever heard of him before

[00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:52.620]
He ain't even as good as Sage, Surge, Erosen, Cranced, Edelstine, Forts

[00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:55.620]
So they got real, they're going to have some real-time, of course, Ricky

[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.440]
I don't think Ricky's coming up here though

[00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:00.220]
They said they don't want him like exhaust, they want you to weed supply

[00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:02.900]
So the local officials are really reconsidering letting him come up

[00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:04.480]
Plus, the Dolphins aren't going to let him out of this

[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:08.060]
He's got a contract that says that he can't play anywhere else anyway

[00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:08.900]
I'll be damned

[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:09.800]
Did you know that?

[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:10.460]
I did not

[00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:14.480]
Well, that's what the deal is, and Nick Saban says, a-a-a, at least so far

[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:17.300]
So this business, he's coming to Toronto, he's going to play for the Argos

[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:22.440]
In fact, the article on the paper said, he didn't mention the fact that he's very fond of the wicked weed

[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:24.760]
And they're coming here, he'd be a very happy camper

[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:28.740]
Because everybody in their brother is smoking like openly here, practically gagging on it

[00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:32.420]
The New Black Panther Party rallies to support a accuser

[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:36.620]
And the Duke, look at that, the New Black Panther Party meets near Duke University

[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:37.400]
Just what we needed

[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:39.140]
The former striker, and in the Coltsmith

[00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:44.740]
Now we know, we just had that beat him, beat your Mrs. Ellen Vaughn, of course he got- he got a slap on her wrist on Friday

[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:47.340]
Russia, what are you talking about? A little tap on her wrist

[00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:48.700]
They- I don't do it again

[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:54.780]
Pay $3,000 or whatever it was, we're going to put you on probation and, you know, very sad

[00:31:55.420 --> 00:32:00.200]
1042 at 560 WQM, what's better than staying cool and comfortable all summer long

[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:04.040]
And by pretty soon it's going to be as hot as Hades every day for months and months and months

[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:08.420]
How about getting an instant $1200 cool cash rebate on the world's smartest air conditioner?

[00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:10.960]

This is Neal Rogers, this is 5.62-8-0

[00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:22.520]
You call this big market radio?

[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:30.260]
The you enjoy sharing the great outdoors with your life partner, then hit the trail with a new broke back mountain bike

[00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:32.120]
I wish I knew how to quit!

[00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:37.260]
Just keep pumping, we're almost there

[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:41.100]
What you do when you get to the top of the mountain is none of our business

[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:44.520]
You know, it could be like this, just like this

[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:45.360]
Always

[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:48.780]
What? Sweaty, stinky with all these blisters?

[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:50.220]
Yeah, right

[00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:00.660]
Oh, look at that, they just had your boy on there

[00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:01.180]

[00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:03.580]
Yeah, your boy, a bushing is twin, look at the door

[00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:03.940]

[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:08.920]
Yeah, 802 vote, the star-spangled banner should be sung in English only for 25

[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:11.560]

They just had all in protestors, all in beaders down there at homestay run around

[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.780]
CCCIC, Jose Can You See?

[00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:18.400]

802 votes, English only for 85

[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.420]
Rarely, it's a bad song, 121, that's for damn sure

In any language, 101, whatever you like, who gives a shmit, 83, excellent choice?

[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:31.380]
In English, or in Spanish, salamanting the way of A

And I hate this pool only 3 out of 807 vote already

[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:39.080]
But we got that thousand licked in fact, I'm going to go play golf once we get to a thousand votes or hurry it up

[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.100]
Let's get with it

[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:48.920]
Tuddy, the hero says the legendary South Florida Morning Radio host will put on his last show this week after more than three decades on the year according to CBS 4

[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:52.020]
The veteran on air personality, whose name is John Cross

[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:57.780]
Will host his final segment for the Y100 Morning Show on Y100 this Friday, the new station say

[00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:02.100]
Cross, Cross, whatever his name is, and became cohost in the morning 32 years ago

[00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:07.260]
Said he'll continue overseeing his charity, Here's Help, which has raised money for numerous area organizations

[00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:11.900]
What else could I possibly do in radio, who to report to Brian Andrews?

[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:12.380]
You ferry!

[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:16.640]
I'm not going to go to satellite because I ain't moving and nobody wants to syndicate a guy from Miami

[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:17.980]
So this is it, you're stuck with me

[00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:19.840]
And nobody wants to syndicate a guy from Miami

[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:23.300]
So you're stuck, I don't know what that means, so you're stuck with me

[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:25.180]
It's like show is Friday but we're stuck with him

[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:26.860]
Do you have any idea what that means?

[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:29.920]
I have no clue, and don't care either, care much less

[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:33.940]
Speaking of radio, we got those big ratings coming out of 1130 tomorrow morning

[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:42.580]
Bridge ratings has released its latest update to their ongoing study of consumer awareness of the two satellite radio brands along with subscription trends

[00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:50.620]
The latest results go right up to this week, finding that as the study has gone on, brand loyalty and programming options have become a more important factor for consumers

[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:54.880]
The majority of whom have said that serious has superior programming to XM

[00:35:54.880 --> 00:36:02.180]
However, here's the big butt, however, the power of Howard Stern to bring in new serious subscribers appears to have stalled out

[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:10.900]
After adding over a million new subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2005, there was a 26% drop off to 814,000 new subscriptions in the first quarter of this year

[00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:20.140]
Looking at the same timeframes, XM added approximately 900,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter of last year with another 568,000 in the first quarter of this year

[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:21.940]
A 37% drop off

[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:26.600]
In the first month of the second year, Bridge says that the Stern effect has basically stalled

[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:33.120]
Bridge estimates that roughly 1.1 million, 84% of Stern's fans have followed him to serious 8%

[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:39.060]
When Stern fans were asked to wait for why they had not subscribed to serious, 32% said they didn't miss a show enough to sign up

[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:42.000]
With 25% said the cost involved were too much to pay

[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:49.460]
Looking at what satcaster was acquiring more subscribers, they pinned on his wrong back and forth week to week between the two with XM pulling ahead for much of April

[00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:54.080]
Programming options and elected commercials made the top two reasons why new subscribers made their choices

[00:36:54.080 --> 00:37:00.640]
As for awareness of the two brands, this number has also gone back and forth week to week with XM on top again for much of April

[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:07.040]
Bridge ratings released at second full quarterfightings in July, so it's definitely something in July we'll find out

[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:13.000]
Ready for that is that some exciting news or what all this is exciting as footies going to hang up is a microphone

[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:16.300]
I don't even know if I ever heard him on here I do know he's a real jerk

[00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:18.860]
At least I've been told I've never heard him

[00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:22.140]
He did some kind of a he was working for that broad some broadcasting school

[00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:24.400]
I'm not sure whether it's the one we used to advertise or who it was

[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:24.840]
I don't know

[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:28.720]
And we had some intern that came and said oh yeah he went there to one of the footies classes

[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:32.300]
And he said and the footies said well whatever you do don't be like that near Rogers

[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:34.840]
Because he he's unprofessional and don't be like that

[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:43.340]
And remember that just trashed a hell out of me sure who would want to be successful who would want to be make that kind of money and be successful and live a fine life that he's living in Toronto

[00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:45.660]
And I have to be in the swill of South Florida

[00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:52.840]
That's right don't be like me whatever you do footy loser yeah gone fishing go fishing sweetheart go have a great life

[00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:59.160]
Torp and anyway five six seven look I said I'm going to take a lot of calls today man because you can see already

[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:06.000]
Well at least we did see a little while ago that they were forming at the mouth that's too bad about that danger boy group in Stockholm down so bad

[00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:09.160]
WQ I am hello

[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:11.720]

Yeah

[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:13.880]
Mm-hmm

[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:14.180]
Uh-huh

[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:17.320]
Well he seems to be fading badly ladies and ladies those tight suspenders

[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:21.260]
Five six seven oh five sixty boy they were on fire for a while they're worth they

[00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:25.220]
They must they must have taken that guy's advice they must be all hitting the streets now get out there for that

[00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:25.900]
That's worth it

[00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:26.960]
They're boycotting it

[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:32.200]
Maybe they're just boycotting the show today wouldn't surprise wouldn't be the first time or maybe they're boycotting the fact we got guilty

[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:33.740]
I took it again

[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:39.040]
Why not just give him the deal okay I mean it's pretty obvious they want to put him on their everyday two to four just give it to him

[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:44.560]
Okay and stop with this game that you're playing whatever it is this kind of sadistic thing that they're doing to all of us

[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:48.160]
Just put him on there we're not going to be too happy about it but then again at least it'll be the other half of it

[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:51.960]
Very duo that we used to have in the morning now that the moment is gone

[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:58.460]
This Clara Valboa he is just a wizard just a miracle worker WQYM hello

[00:38:58.460 --> 00:38:59.780]

Yes, Neil

[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:12.620]
Yes sir

[00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:24.920]
Neil this is Marco your Italian listener for many many years. Yes, I was in either I'm back in Miami and I'm very happy to hear your voice again

[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:32.600]
I was I want to just to comment something Neil about your show if it's possible

[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:34.240]
Yeah

[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:42.080]
It looks like the audience has really dropped in quality and

[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:48.440]
They have very little interest in you know the most important things that happen in this country

[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:51.840]
No it's the same it's the same you rather it's the same for the videos

[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:55.920]
The most two things and I guess the most creative well it's very representative of America

[00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:01.240]
I was very well and I have a great day and I read that Archie and Bonasetta and bye bye with the bad Tony accent

[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:09.440]
560 have an 0560 pound 560 neighbor rising singular wireless lines I wonder I wonder what time they had the meeting to set these calls up today

[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:17.660]
This was good I think they knew it was that was that was they got together with Denny's quarter table there the big right you hop WQYM hello

[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:19.320]
Yes sir

[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:25.380]
I got a comment for these immigrants and all the paint shows back let's save all the fire women

[00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:26.900]
Yeah okay

[00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:39.100]
Don't don't ask don't ask and I won't tell somebody Q. I. M. Hello. Hey Neil. I don't welcome back welcome back from where I'm just kidding I haven't been for a while I've been out of town

[00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:47.380]
But I wanted to ask you are you're bashing your management there kids did you ever figure out what this static is usually the Mexican station now it's Russian today

[00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:49.240]
Is it bad for them?

[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:59.320]
I wait we don't know we don't care how's that that's the key I'm not sure we don't know we don't care and don't bother us with such important things I'm sorry I'd rather listen to you though not the other station but appreciate it

[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:06.840]
Okay have a go have a have a lot more than of course nobody's telling us about it from the inside only the audience lets us know what's really going on you know

[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:14.980]
So I think we have to be very jackass to find out about programming decisions that are being made same thing because nobody inside probably even listen to any way they're listening to power 96

[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:32.200]
The first time in my life I ever worked in a place even if I was down there in a building if you know like have only your mad the Russians to the tea room during a commercial break and you can't really hear when the break is going to end or you know how fast you have to get back because they don't have the station on the monitors anywhere in the right just to be fair they don't have the other station on in there either

[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:41.260]
No it just sounds a silence that's right well at least the sequel opportunity in difference that that's a good acoustics in there for the other sounds you hear but you can hear power 96 on the phone

[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:53.980]
That's great they sure wouldn't want to put this on the phone oh god for big can you imagine all the people they piss off putting the Neil Rogers your on the phone we're not even talking about sports in the sanctity of the NFL draft you have to be deaf not to catch the draft

[00:41:55.740 --> 00:42:05.680]
It is so and now that that's over with what do they do now on what are sports nerds do now the marlins are 6 and 16 I mean they can win a fixed game and it just they couldn't draw flies to a manure pile

[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:19.020]
And so that's done of course the Panthers their playoffs are they ain't no playoffs so what what do you got going on I'm of course leader lost again oh my god to the bulls wow that's embarrassing and they had all that controversy in that one game they go all

[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:27.480]
Disorganized in this kabubled and just falling apart of the seams I can you imagine if they should get eliminated if I can say that hey can I say that choice eliminate

[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:46.420]
Would that be something because then what so long hot summer baby between the first of May and football went once the first exhibition is game August something oh yeah August boy June July all your man oh man three solid months what the other sports are going to do there except maybe go out and play some golf

[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:51.240]

[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:36.480]
sixty it's the guilty warm-up show man we got guilty it too see I think the new

[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:39.220]
format is we got a bunch of people who show up pretty much whenever it's

[00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:43.000]
convenient for them is the new format all right it's kind of interesting you

[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.860]
got to admit nobody in other states in the country's got a deal like that keep

[00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:48.960]

very soon oh not soon enough but very soon but at least we know at least we know

[00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:00.500]
what that schedule is also let me just pass this along in case there's anybody

[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:04.800]
inside a building listening which I doubt at two o'clock when the idea is over

[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:07.940]
and then whatever cute stuff you put in there after the idea that's when you

[00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:13.360]
chop us off not whatever you feel like it's more the ideal idea like even the

[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:17.260]

that's what you're trying to do right now my any four-dollar day see there was a

[00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:31.960]
legal idea to make up for the one we missed it to a clock on Friday yeah because

we got a quote in a field you know like the cops are like the porkers you know

we got to fill our quota because from what I'm being told this morning is we

[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:42.000]
have just you know it's kind of like a sliding rotation there they're sliding

[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.180]
and rotating it and whoever happens to be running the board to with somebody

[00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:48.840]
different every day oh well what do I do now and is that it do we chop those

[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:52.020]

like this Susan Sarandas revealed how she felt isolated and frightened by

[00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:38.360]

program he she said that the way she and her family have been targeted by the

[00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:58.900]
media in the public was horrifying horrifying Mr. Randon 59 said she believed that

[00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:01.660]
there should have been more debate before the war but that anyone who questioned

[00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:05.680]
U.S. policy was labeled on American of course we know that I don't think I ever

[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:07.960]
thought somebody would ever really kill me although there were some people who

[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:10.960]
said I've actually been to knock her off on the radio and stuff like that she

[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:15.480]
said well people say a lot of crap on the radio right no they don't they

[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:18.720]
without immigrants is what they keep labeling this and this has got absolutely

[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:23.200]
nothing to do with immigrants okay once again see and then totally bogus it's

[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:28.380]
just like the the great freedom operation Iraqi freedom all these other lies they

[00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:31.960]
put on the screen as they do nothing but suck up to the abou shmeister call

[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:37.960]
the fascists they without immigrants my fat ass toll on American soil this is

[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:41.700]
the time to do that this window is not gonna open okay let me get in here

[00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:44.740]

it up a little bit so great let me get you in here you're taking a little bit

[00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:51.240]

Hispanic brothers and sisters on the front lines let's stop and ask the

[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:56.780]

to Iraq how's that that's a good idea yeah we got a shortage so cool and

[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:04.200]
policy we didn't send enough troops let's send all these protesters over there

[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:07.220]
if they wanted to help much they love America and how much they want to be in

[00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:10.700]
America go over there and fight for your country for Christ's and stop worrying

[00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:13.560]

Facts says being a degenerate camera I enjoy listening to Eddie Kaye late at night even though the

[00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:47.200]
Cuban station to be heard in the background we've ever done that got some very serious signal

[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:51.640]
problems too it is no longer possible to listen to your station later night as the Cuban station is

[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:56.160]
now even louder than any Kaye is the station doing anything about this no or are they going

[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:59.120]

in uh closing i'd like to say to the people who might be listening i work at wkym that i think

[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:16.200]

[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:20.960]
well i got three years to go and i got three years to go i'm 60 and i'm sorry let me ask

[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:26.700]
your honest question yeah you go ahead how old are you i'm 31 years old okay now do you aspire to work

[01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:31.460]
until you're dead no i do not would you like to work until you're like 75 or something like that i

[01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:35.860]
don't want to do that either see now i'd like to work till i'm so i'm comfortable and then i

[01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:40.440]
could sit there and go and enjoy life and i can do that right now i actually i could walk out of

[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:44.960]
here right now and do that i got plenty of cash exactly and you know what there's gonna be a big

[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:50.860]
black hole void in their radio station when you leave tomorrow yeah exactly and they need the

[01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:55.780]
learn that this is the week for protest i think you inspired me i'm gonna do my boycott tomorrow

[01:03:56.580 --> 01:04:02.720]
that's right in closing i have one uh film recommendation for you okay um it's it's

[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:07.480]
Georgia's probably not gonna agree as far as the actor but uh i i personally thought that film

[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:12.800]
content was really good it's a movie called the foreigner with students to go uh it had really

[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:18.620]
really good you never heard of it you never heard of it no it's it's what we was on

[01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:25.980]
but he had really good plot content normally his plot content is not all that and he also does a

[01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:31.160]
little bit over dramatic on the martial arts and stuff but if time he was very good with the plot

[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:36.800]
content and as well as the um the fighting scenes were realistic uh they didn't go aboard with that

[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:41.060]
so that's pretty much it and it was a really good talk with you Neil thanks a lot pal i have a great

[01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:45.600]
thing you take it easy see there there was now that's that's it that's a great call and that's

[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:50.240]
what we need now the rest of them can be all idiots can be i think that's a 31 perfect

[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:54.480]
demographic good guy sounded like he and i q are doing a stumb and he had something to say

[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:58.940]
and i think the the most important part of that call was his suggestion that i boycott this

[01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:03.500]
current regime man because they they're just killing us seriously i i think what we ought to do

[01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:08.440]
is is put out a call for help remember when Lee arby as well got arrested uh huh and he said i

[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:12.220]
i can't forget the exact verbiage and i should know it because i just said i thought

[01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:16.620]
the memory of the day but he put out a call for assistance he's exactly for some of the step forward

[01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:20.700]
in a system because he didn't have any idea what it was all about and he's being set up and i'm

[01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:25.400]
just a patty and yeah which course is true although i don't call me patty close it's patty

[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:31.780]
climb poor patty climb i think she was okay you know she had her hits she had like crazy which of

[01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:36.140]
course fits right into this radio station crazy i mean well what what is really going on with

[01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:40.340]
these people there i mean you know you're there are they like they're just waiting for tomorrow for

[01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:44.460]
the other balls to drop when those numbers come out tomorrow morning look they're they're in a

[01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:48.520]
position that they can't expect i know the position i've seen people in that position

[01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:55.220]
remember in requiem oh yeah i forgot i asked to ask i've seen a lot of people in that position

[01:05:55.220 --> 01:06:00.660]
they're in a position what that there's no remedy for yeah but you know something it's like

fauna will make clear that global warming and human activity is responsible the report will

[01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:44.920]
confirm that the common skate what's abundant around britain has been virtually wiped out the

[01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:49.520]
fish is still stocked by some supermarkets and fish mongers but there's increasing pressure on them

[01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:53.860]

and then the bobby kennedy got off and then after that he became extremely disillusioned and

[01:39:29.930 --> 01:39:34.490]
wanted to like seclusion and this and then of course like most of these entertainers when they

[01:39:34.490 --> 01:39:37.730]
want to get out just when they thought they were out they could pull back in and they had to go

[01:39:37.730 --> 01:39:43.370]
back on the nightclub circuit because he was broke broke and whoever had the rights to all those

[01:39:43.370 --> 01:39:47.590]
songs went bankrupt they lost all that money from all those big hit songs he had you know like

[01:39:47.590 --> 01:39:55.610]
Mac the knife and right and beyond the sea like like that and then his heart gave out

[01:39:59.530 --> 01:40:03.690]
well he said that he had some kind of dental work you know i guess when he had a bad heart i

[01:40:03.690 --> 01:40:07.510]

May 1st is the third anniversary of the end of major combat in Iraq it was a glorious day when George

[02:03:57.020 --> 02:04:00.500]
Bush the one of the deck of Abraham Lincoln was hailed by the rapturous throngs of totally

[02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:05.380]
newspersons such as Chris Matthews and that's the president looking very much like a jettia

[02:04:05.380 --> 02:04:11.020]
no a high flying star he said in a hardball May 1st 2003 and Bob Sheifer who said as far as I'm

[02:04:11.020 --> 02:04:14.620]
considered that was one of the great pictures of all time and if you're a political consultant you

[02:04:14.620 --> 02:04:18.180]
can just see campaign commercials written all over the pictures of George Bush that was on

[02:04:18.180 --> 02:04:23.480]
meet the press May 4th 2003 what a fast and clean war G Gordon Litty was enthralled with the

president's package all those women who say size doesn't count through all liars hardball may 7th

[02:04:28.480 --> 02:04:33.880]
2003 and a new era free from terrorism was ushered in this is the faith based fable of what

[02:04:33.880 --> 02:04:38.300]
happened almost exactly three years ago the reality based scenario goes something like this

[02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:42.960]
over 24 hundred American soldiers including my son who was killed almost a year after mission

[02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:47.360]
accomplished day have come home and cardboard boxes and cargo areas of planes in the secrecy of

[02:04:47.360 --> 02:04:51.460]
the night thousands of young people are wounded many grievously also bust into water read

[02:04:51.460 --> 02:04:55.600]
other hospitals in the dark of the night tons of rubble upon rubble in Iraq with inconsistent

[02:04:55.600 --> 02:05:00.280]
electrical power still and not much clean water or chance of future power and clean water hundreds

[02:05:00.280 --> 02:05:04.460]
of thousands of innocent Iraqi civilians are dead being punished for the sins of a leader who

[02:05:04.460 --> 02:05:09.580]
was propped up armed and supported by many us regimes the mission mission accomplished day

[02:05:09.580 --> 02:05:15.260]
or operation cod piece public relations dream for the presidential pelvic zone has turned into a

[02:05:15.260 --> 02:05:18.980]
frighteningly real nightmare for so many people around the world who have had sons daughters

[02:05:18.980 --> 02:05:24.200]
mothers fathers sisters brothers and oftentimes entire families wife found devastated by the

[02:05:24.200 --> 02:05:27.820]
strutting and smirking terrorists who was feeling mighty chipperize that at the Washington

[02:05:27.820 --> 02:05:32.400]
correspondence annual dinner as the 24 hundred soldier was being killed and as the 24 hundred

[02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:36.420]
gold star mother was falling on the floor screaming for her child there are hundreds of

[02:05:36.420 --> 02:05:40.680]
thousands of people on our plane who have a hard time ever feeling chipper again because of George

[02:05:40.680 --> 02:05:45.700]
Bush no matter how good he looks in a flight suit now that Bush co is done such a fantastic job

[02:05:45.700 --> 02:05:48.820]
with the invasion and occupation of Iraq that should never have happened in the first place

[02:05:48.820 --> 02:05:53.560]
the now that it has happened is extraordinarily evil in scope and tactics he's warning Iran that if

[02:05:53.560 --> 02:05:57.320]
it doesn't shape up the west is going to come and impose freedom in democracy on that country

[02:05:57.320 --> 02:06:02.820]
the ra ra yes sir congress was an easy job of proving everything that George does thereby eliminating

[02:06:02.820 --> 02:06:06.820]
critical thinking to pay to any semblance of rational discussion as voted for sanctions

[02:06:06.820 --> 02:06:10.740]
they will need to an attack on Iran which will be devastating for our troops in Iraq and for

[02:06:10.740 --> 02:06:15.320]
that poor region that had the unfortunate luck to be built upon tremendous oil and natural gas reserves

[02:06:15.320 --> 02:06:20.220]
only 21 congress people voted nay on the Iran Freedom of Support Act which is incredible

[02:06:20.220 --> 02:06:23.920]
considering what happened when they voted yay to give George Bush the green light for every

[02:06:23.920 --> 02:06:28.100]
section against the Iraq into invaded our ran into one of the yay voters on the Iran Freedom

[02:06:28.100 --> 02:06:32.540]
Support Act representative made your own and asked him why he voted that way he said because

[02:06:32.540 --> 02:06:37.540]
of what he hated the evil regime of Iran I asked him about our own evil irresponsible regime

[02:06:37.540 --> 02:06:41.720]
the radical president of Iran says very irresponsible and inflammatory things but viral

[02:06:41.720 --> 02:06:45.520]
accounts is over a decade away from a nuclear weapon and is reigned in by the mules and the

[02:06:45.520 --> 02:06:49.660]
young population of Iran to this very westernized we're in trouble with our one party system of

[02:06:49.660 --> 02:06:54.320]
government which is the war party before we the people need to be subjected to another swaggering

[02:06:54.320 --> 02:06:58.560]
spectacle from George after he's bombed Iran back in the stone ages and has made we the people

[02:06:58.560 --> 02:07:03.540]
of the U.S. even more hated around the world it's time to rate him in ourselves congress won't do it

[02:07:07.740 --> 02:07:11.620]
whose bloodlust could up be slated and hire people who finally use their wisdom integrity and

[02:07:11.620 --> 02:07:15.700]
nonviolence to solve problems and will create image imaginary problems out of smoke and mirrors

[02:07:15.700 --> 02:07:20.140]
we need to congress that'll hold George accountable not when it's complicit in the war crimes

[02:07:20.560 --> 02:07:24.500]

the former university professor to spend another year and a half in prison before he's deported

[02:15:23.960 --> 02:15:28.700]
in his terrorism conspiracy case L Ariane 48 was sentenced to four years and nine months but it'll

[02:15:28.700 --> 02:15:31.660]
get credit for the more than three years and two months he's already served while being held

[02:15:31.660 --> 02:15:36.620]
before and after his trial US district judge James S Moody I wonder if he's getting a John Moody the

[02:15:36.620 --> 02:15:40.760]
driver from Hazel Park James Moody delivered some harsh words for the former university of South

[02:15:40.760 --> 02:15:45.340]
Florida computer engineering professor Moody said he believed that L Ariane was an active leader in a

[02:15:45.340 --> 02:15:50.480]
Palestinian Islamic jihad who raised money for suicide bombings in Israel and the Palestinian

[02:15:50.480 --> 02:15:54.920]
territories and lied about his involvement like Danny Gallivan would have said the Palestinian

[02:15:54.920 --> 02:15:59.400]
territories dismissing the fence content that money raised by L Ariane his co-defeat and

[02:15:59.400 --> 02:16:03.240]
twin support Palestinian charity said Moody said your own a connection to widows and orphans

[02:16:03.240 --> 02:16:07.440]
was that you create them that's a good line that's your only that's like George Boyce that's

[02:16:07.440 --> 02:16:11.480]
his only connection to widows and orphans is that he creates them very good judge you go judge

[02:16:11.480 --> 02:16:16.300]

[02:17:29.060 --> 02:17:29.700]
Somebody QYM?

[02:17:29.820 --> 02:17:29.940]
Hello.

[02:17:30.400 --> 02:17:30.580]
Hello.

[02:17:31.020 --> 02:17:31.500]
Yes, sir.

[02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:32.480]
Yeah.

[02:17:33.560 --> 02:17:37.820]
I want to tell you something, I don't know, should go on the air.

[02:17:38.300 --> 02:17:42.820]
I was listening to the Air America show of ADO on the weekend.

[02:17:43.720 --> 02:17:45.960]
Well, if you don't know if it should go on the air, how are we going to do there?

[02:17:46.020 --> 02:17:46.960]
What am I going to dump it?

[02:17:47.400 --> 02:17:48.140]
The favorite.

[02:17:48.520 --> 02:17:48.800]
Oh, I want to put that here.

[02:17:49.280 --> 02:17:49.600]
Hello.

[02:17:50.060 --> 02:17:50.980]
Yeah, we want to hear it.

[02:17:50.980 --> 02:17:59.100]
So, she said she came in contact with this new app thing that you could eat beans and

[02:17:59.100 --> 02:18:01.540]
you wouldn't deal with the flat ones.

[02:18:02.260 --> 02:18:02.340]
Yeah.

[02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:09.140]
And then what she did was, for about 10, 15 seconds after that, she made the farting sounds

[02:18:09.140 --> 02:18:09.920]
on the radio.

[02:18:09.940 --> 02:18:11.420]
Well, that's because she doesn't work for Joyce.

[02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:12.360]
Okay, so there you go.

[02:18:12.440 --> 02:18:16.120]
That's the guy that's making farting sounds on the air because we can't.

[02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:16.420]
Okay.

[02:18:16.420 --> 02:18:20.400]
And she's also still all my sounders and that's okay.

[02:18:20.980 --> 02:18:23.000]
Never had the original thought in her mind.

[02:18:23.380 --> 02:18:26.940]
And speaking of her, by the way, I want to have our good buddies do it.

[02:18:27.240 --> 02:18:27.600]
Which buddy?

[02:18:28.140 --> 02:18:28.520]
Hi.

[02:18:29.180 --> 02:18:29.960]
This is Jim.

[02:18:30.500 --> 02:18:30.820]
That one.

[02:18:31.820 --> 02:18:33.240]
Well, you know, she was confused.

[02:18:33.520 --> 02:18:35.380]
I think that that's probably part of the dealer.

[02:18:35.580 --> 02:18:36.000]
She was confused.

[02:18:36.200 --> 02:18:38.240]
And Anna Maria still ain't interested, by the way, sweetheart.

[02:18:53.280 --> 02:18:54.340]
Mexican protest day.

[02:18:54.380 --> 02:18:54.720]
Yes, sir.

[02:18:56.200 --> 02:18:56.420]
I know.

[02:18:56.560 --> 02:19:00.000]
I know there's a lot of protests and everything going on, but what's up with the Joey

[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:00.760]
Harris and deal with?

[02:19:01.140 --> 02:19:02.000]
Yeah, what is up?

[02:19:02.160 --> 02:19:03.480]
That's what they're protesting about.

[02:19:03.660 --> 02:19:04.420]
What's wrong with you, man?

[02:19:04.540 --> 02:19:04.980]
Get with it.

[02:19:05.500 --> 02:19:07.200]
That's what they're all lined up protesting about.

[02:19:07.300 --> 02:19:09.580]
Those are all the illegal alien doll fans, man.

[02:19:09.680 --> 02:19:10.060]
They're protesting.

[02:19:10.200 --> 02:19:12.720]
They don't want no Joey Harrington, retread, reject from Detroit.

[02:19:13.240 --> 02:19:13.980]
God, as he's suck.

[02:19:13.980 --> 02:19:15.140]
He's so bad.

[02:19:15.520 --> 02:19:16.500]
Ever see him play Josh?

[02:19:17.020 --> 02:19:17.220]
Of course.

[02:19:17.700 --> 02:19:18.460]
He sure can't play.

[02:19:18.780 --> 02:19:19.480]
He is pathetic.

[02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:21.380]
You could go out there and do a better job.

[02:19:21.840 --> 02:19:22.620]
In fact, I'm your aunt here.

[02:19:22.860 --> 02:19:26.240]
Even Troy DeVoy, who was running back back in the day, even he could go out there and

[02:19:26.240 --> 02:19:28.300]
probably sling it better than Joey Harrington.

[02:19:28.700 --> 02:19:30.420]
Joey Reynolds could probably be about a quarterback.

[02:19:30.980 --> 02:19:34.880]
So all this BS that Nick Saban has played with, and, first of all, they got a reading

[02:19:34.880 --> 02:19:38.600]
discontent and a hostile, banged up, injured quarterback that's going to play.

[02:19:38.960 --> 02:19:42.760]
Maybe, hopefully, by the last time, by the time that they're 1-7, then he'll be ready

[02:19:42.760 --> 02:19:43.280]
to step in.

[02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:45.340]
You know, step back in, like Michael said.

[02:19:45.440 --> 02:19:46.460]
Remember that step back in?

[02:19:46.500 --> 02:19:47.240]
Mm-hmm.

[02:19:47.240 --> 02:19:50.180]
And Godfather 3, which Josh did finally see, and he's out here.

[02:19:50.300 --> 02:19:54.080]
Oh, and the goodness for George is your movies that has already been shipped out this

[02:19:54.080 --> 02:19:54.400]
week.

[02:19:55.040 --> 02:19:55.480]
Can't wait.

[02:19:55.820 --> 02:19:56.420]
What's the name of it?

[02:19:56.940 --> 02:19:57.300]
I forgot.

[02:19:57.860 --> 02:20:02.120]
Well, whatever it is, it's the Kurt Cobain.

[02:20:02.680 --> 02:20:03.480]
Oh, yeah.

[02:20:04.140 --> 02:20:04.300]
Yeah.

[02:20:04.360 --> 02:20:07.940]
Yeah, the last days of Kurt Cobain, the worst movie, if you don't agree with me, that's

[02:20:07.940 --> 02:20:11.340]
one of the five or 10 worst movies that's ever been made, much less than you've ever

[02:20:11.340 --> 02:20:11.600]
seen.

[02:20:11.600 --> 02:20:14.140]
Then you're just, you must be doing heavy-ass.

[02:20:14.400 --> 02:20:14.520]
Let's play it.

[02:20:14.640 --> 02:20:15.340]
There's to be scientific.

[02:20:15.420 --> 02:20:18.340]
I'll get really baked before I walk into see if that chain is.

[02:20:18.340 --> 02:20:19.860]
They do it even come close, okay?

[02:20:20.160 --> 02:20:20.600]
Deep fried.

[02:20:20.900 --> 02:20:21.700]
Might do it.

[02:20:21.800 --> 02:20:22.260]
Deep fried.

[02:20:22.580 --> 02:20:23.660]
Stick my head in the microwave.

[02:20:23.860 --> 02:20:24.020]
Right.

[02:20:24.640 --> 02:20:25.400]
WDQYM, hello.

[02:20:26.040 --> 02:20:27.300]
Whatever it is, it's there.

[02:20:29.100 --> 02:20:30.800]
Kurt Cobain, hello.

[02:20:31.760 --> 02:20:32.280]
Now.

[02:20:32.780 --> 02:20:35.020]
The worst movie.

[02:20:35.400 --> 02:20:35.580]
Now.

[02:20:36.220 --> 02:20:36.980]
Yeah, sorry.

[02:20:37.500 --> 02:20:37.880]
Yeah.

[02:20:38.480 --> 02:20:40.000]
Can I stick to middle?

[02:20:40.340 --> 02:20:40.800]
It's sticking.

[02:20:42.040 --> 02:20:42.800]
Neil, hi.

[02:20:43.280 --> 02:20:43.660]
Hi.

[02:20:44.260 --> 02:20:44.640]
Hi.

[02:20:45.020 --> 02:20:45.160]
Hello.

[02:20:45.780 --> 02:20:47.160]
Are you a regular fan?

[02:20:47.580 --> 02:20:48.300]
I said, how you doing?

[02:20:49.020 --> 02:20:49.440]
I'm good.

[02:20:49.680 --> 02:20:49.960]
I'm good.

[02:20:50.840 --> 02:20:52.400]
This doesn't sound like Neil.

[02:20:52.940 --> 02:20:54.480]
Well, what would you like me to do?

[02:20:54.580 --> 02:20:56.440]
I could make them fart sounds, but Joyce won't get it as well.

[02:20:56.460 --> 02:20:57.960]
Maybe they turn the radio off.

[02:20:58.440 --> 02:21:01.780]
Yeah, maybe if you turn the radio off and stuck the phone to your ear instead of where you've

[02:21:01.780 --> 02:21:01.940]
had it.

[02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:02.160]
Yeah.

[02:21:02.940 --> 02:21:03.920]
There you go.

[02:21:04.860 --> 02:21:05.560]
What do you got?

[02:21:06.320 --> 02:21:09.980]
Well, I just, how much is it?

[02:21:09.980 --> 02:21:11.500]
It's price of what we're going to be on today.

[02:21:13.600 --> 02:21:14.000]
56670560.

[02:21:14.200 --> 02:21:14.720]
See it right there?

[02:21:14.820 --> 02:21:15.520]
There's a reason right away.

[02:21:15.700 --> 02:21:16.080]
He's from.

[02:21:16.180 --> 02:21:16.820]
We're sending him back.

[02:21:16.940 --> 02:21:17.460]
That's where you're going.

[02:21:17.540 --> 02:21:18.740]
I'd go home and pack right now.

[02:21:18.940 --> 02:21:19.120]
Okay.

[02:21:19.380 --> 02:21:20.000]
Went back.

[02:21:20.140 --> 02:21:20.540]
Get lost.

[02:21:22.440 --> 02:21:24.920]
56670560 and pump 566 in the Verizon singular wireless line.

[02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:25.740]
Guilty again today.

[02:21:26.340 --> 02:21:26.980]
Oh, man.

[02:21:27.100 --> 02:21:27.640]
We got guilty.

[02:21:27.660 --> 02:21:29.080]
We're just petrified.

[02:21:29.080 --> 02:21:29.980]
We got so much guilty.

[02:21:30.500 --> 02:21:31.940]
It is really a scary thing.

[02:21:32.320 --> 02:21:35.600]
And of course, exclusively on BBGI, the banjo board group Inc.

[02:21:36.080 --> 02:21:36.940]
Nobody else wants it.

[02:21:37.760 --> 02:21:38.420]
WDQYM, hello.

[02:21:40.680 --> 02:21:41.000]
QAM.

[02:21:41.460 --> 02:21:42.280]
Hey, what's up, Neil?

[02:21:42.660 --> 02:21:43.020]
Yes, sir.

[02:21:43.360 --> 02:21:43.720]
Hey, man.

[02:21:43.900 --> 02:21:44.400]
A big fan.

[02:21:44.640 --> 02:21:45.480]
This is for you for years.

[02:21:45.680 --> 02:21:46.400]
I love your show.

[02:21:46.920 --> 02:21:48.400]
Are you really a good two-on-most?

[02:21:48.540 --> 02:21:49.680]
The things you talk about, right?

[02:21:50.060 --> 02:21:52.660]
On this legal immigration thing, I can't agree with 200.

[02:21:53.180 --> 02:21:54.680]
Well, what is there to disagree about?

[02:21:54.920 --> 02:21:57.040]
In other words, the illegal people we ought to just let them all come in.

[02:21:57.600 --> 02:22:00.060]
I've come in the law only outside of four people.

[02:22:00.180 --> 02:22:01.600]
The president don't got to follow the law.

[02:22:02.280 --> 02:22:03.660]
Rich white kids go to do it.

[02:22:03.680 --> 02:22:04.580]
Don't got to follow the law.

[02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:05.280]
Yeah.

[02:22:05.740 --> 02:22:06.600]
You got to don't make no sense.

[02:22:06.980 --> 02:22:08.520]
Well, what the hell does that mean?

[02:22:08.920 --> 02:22:11.220]
In other words, if somebody raped somebody, they're not going to go to jail.

[02:22:11.220 --> 02:22:12.600]
What are you talking about, man?

[02:22:12.720 --> 02:22:14.220]
Talking crap is what you're talking.

[02:22:14.920 --> 02:22:18.000]
Like Ted Bundy didn't, you know, he didn't have to follow the law.

[02:22:18.400 --> 02:22:20.760]
Rich white people break the law so everybody should be allowed to.

[02:22:20.820 --> 02:22:23.400]
Yeah, in some other words, when white people break the law, they don't pay for it.

[02:22:23.440 --> 02:22:27.240]
Okay, just like the BTK killer that I was talking about before, who is as white as the fallen snow.

[02:22:27.480 --> 02:22:29.600]
In other words, he's good religious and the president of his congregation.

[02:22:30.580 --> 02:22:34.580]
The Lutheran Jesus God, the Almighty congregation there in Wichita.

[02:22:35.840 --> 02:22:39.340]
You do the crime, you're a piece of slime, and you're going to do the time.

[02:22:39.460 --> 02:22:40.320]
That's what it boils down to.

[02:22:40.360 --> 02:22:44.320]
And if you break the law and you come into illegal, first of all, these people to show you how stupid they are,

[02:22:44.460 --> 02:22:47.220]
and how they follow the leader.

[02:22:47.660 --> 02:22:49.620]
Like you said before, if they were smart, they'd lay low.

[02:22:50.040 --> 02:22:50.340]
Right.

[02:22:50.820 --> 02:22:54.940]
They wouldn't be out there and say, but basically, the only sign they should be holding up is one that says,

[02:22:55.180 --> 02:22:55.740]
I'm an illegal.

[02:22:56.120 --> 02:22:56.880]
I came in illegally.

[02:22:57.060 --> 02:22:59.260]
I sneaked in, grabbed me up now and get my ass out of here.

[02:22:59.360 --> 02:23:00.860]
That's what they should be holding up signs.

[02:23:00.900 --> 02:23:01.220]
Okay.

[02:23:01.580 --> 02:23:02.880]
Truth and packaging, baby.

[02:23:03.780 --> 02:23:04.160]
Illegal.

[02:23:04.300 --> 02:23:05.480]
Look it up in a book, okay?

[02:23:05.760 --> 02:23:06.680]
Breaking the law.

[02:23:07.060 --> 02:23:07.980]
Breaking the law.

[02:23:08.340 --> 02:23:10.760]
You know, not just picking the nose, not just Jay Walken.

[02:23:11.320 --> 02:23:13.980]
Not just going out and diddler with their neighbor's wife or something like that.

[02:23:14.140 --> 02:23:16.400]
We're talking about coming in the country illegally here.

[02:23:16.760 --> 02:23:21.200]
And employers are hiring them illegally and paying them under the table, sub-minimum wage.

[02:23:21.320 --> 02:23:23.940]
And of course, no taxes, no nothing.

[02:23:25.120 --> 02:23:30.240]
And if that's the kind of, you know, and again, it comes back to this whole bull crap about Homeland Security.

[02:23:30.240 --> 02:23:31.800]
There is no Homeland Security.

[02:23:32.140 --> 02:23:34.320]
When you can't protect that border, how's anybody going to be safe?

[02:23:34.940 --> 02:23:38.680]
And they build all these damn tunnels and the media is there showing us pictures of all the tunnels.

[02:23:38.960 --> 02:23:42.880]
How come our border patrol ain't doing something about closing down those tunnels, huh?

[02:23:43.200 --> 02:23:43.700]
Can you tell me that?

[02:23:44.360 --> 02:23:46.820]
I know what would close down those tunnels real fast, okay?

[02:23:47.320 --> 02:23:48.020]
Una bomba.

[02:23:48.460 --> 02:23:49.800]
Let's get Richie Valens back.

[02:23:49.940 --> 02:23:50.320]
What are you saying?

[02:23:50.820 --> 02:23:51.680]
Una bomba grande.

[02:23:51.900 --> 02:23:52.620]
I hated him.

[02:23:53.020 --> 02:23:54.060]
I didn't know he could stand him.

[02:23:54.460 --> 02:23:55.800]
They would make any good music at all.

[02:23:55.860 --> 02:23:55.960]
No.

[02:23:56.560 --> 02:23:58.540]
He had old Donna and La Bomba.

[02:23:58.660 --> 02:23:59.800]
That was a middle-year-old's smash.

[02:24:00.040 --> 02:24:01.060]
I didn't like them either.

[02:24:01.420 --> 02:24:03.060]
No, but I would say what else do you have?

[02:24:03.300 --> 02:24:06.820]
And La Bomba, that's a ripoff of like a Pope tin, so he doesn't even have credit for that.

[02:24:08.020 --> 02:24:09.000]
He ain't without me good.

[02:24:15.500 --> 02:24:18.800]
The battle on the banter boys, Bobby Darren and Richie Valens.

[02:24:21.220 --> 02:24:22.340]
And the saddooses.

[02:24:24.380 --> 02:24:28.020]
They're both skill dead. How do you like that? They're both dead. And if you play with

[02:24:28.020 --> 02:24:30.460]
your balance again, you don't gonna do. I think you're at. That's right.

[02:24:31.260 --> 02:24:38.760]
One-thirteen at QIM. This is Neil Rogers. This is 5.16.28.

[02:24:40.460 --> 02:24:44.840]
All right, this is G Gordon Lydia and they don't come any worse than Neil Rogers.

[02:24:48.620 --> 02:24:54.020]
Down the town of Sayy at the Chosen Cube Cafe, I heard some trucks and stuff and

[02:24:54.020 --> 02:24:58.560]
there was a lot of say. I've got a trailer for the next room.

[02:24:59.300 --> 02:25:04.960]
Roll them across the marder just today. All right. Now I won't fall, won't

[02:25:04.960 --> 02:25:09.620]
kill me with cross meat. Dark ones and no bubbles would read around their dreams.

[02:25:09.620 --> 02:25:15.800]
I've got a trailer for the next room. If I could kill them now, I could be rich.

[02:25:17.120 --> 02:25:23.040]
Made a king of mine risking her life and earning a bubble now leaving a ditch.

[02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:29.920]
Just to earn a bubble now, I'm making a ditch. This could work as a bubble now, I'm making a ditch.

[02:25:30.780 --> 02:25:34.900]
The one who's got his mark will work for a wall-monger.

[02:25:35.020 --> 02:25:36.980]
For without the same thing as you.

[02:25:39.320 --> 02:25:41.760]
I've got a trailer for the next room.

[02:25:42.820 --> 02:25:45.840]
So the silver-hide is set for the right of you.

[02:25:46.560 --> 02:25:51.920]
Neil has come in to a man that says, yeah, that'll seem to us.

[02:25:52.280 --> 02:25:56.840]
He can work without the bill. I've got a trailer for the next room.

[02:26:11.140 --> 02:26:12.740]
Mr.

[02:26:12.840 --> 02:26:13.640]
...

[02:26:13.640 --> 02:26:15.800]
And now we take it as a dream.

[02:26:16.380 --> 02:26:18.280]
Shoot the smoke from the windshield.

[02:26:18.600 --> 02:26:19.700]
Blame her job.

[02:26:20.220 --> 02:26:22.680]
Or maybe get permission for her job.

[02:26:23.400 --> 02:26:24.500]
There's one girl in Phoenix.

[02:26:24.760 --> 02:26:25.920]
They're showing all these different periods

[02:26:25.920 --> 02:26:27.300]
who's in the Phoenix and where we're else.

[02:26:27.560 --> 02:26:29.740]
She's like, I guess a lot of them hold up those times.

[02:26:29.860 --> 02:26:30.440]
We are the dream.

[02:26:30.780 --> 02:26:31.820]
No, I think you are the nightmare.

[02:26:32.240 --> 02:26:32.640]
There you go.

[02:26:32.860 --> 02:26:33.380]
Not the dream.

[02:26:34.040 --> 02:26:35.520]
And what this should point out to everybody

[02:26:35.520 --> 02:26:38.120]
is that you got an economy which is in very large part

[02:26:38.120 --> 02:26:40.880]
based on slave labor with illegal labor.

[02:26:40.880 --> 02:26:41.240]
There you go.

[02:26:41.560 --> 02:26:43.420]
And the grave robbing employers that hire

[02:26:43.420 --> 02:26:44.900]
these people, they're the ones that are

[02:26:44.900 --> 02:26:45.800]
behind bars.

[02:26:46.020 --> 02:26:46.820]
It's a surftum.

[02:26:47.280 --> 02:26:48.540]
Now wait till you hear this story.

[02:26:48.920 --> 02:26:51.560]
As activists encourage Latinos, see there we go again.

[02:26:52.620 --> 02:26:54.040]
There's that generalization now.

[02:26:54.180 --> 02:26:55.280]
That's a great smear now.

[02:26:55.380 --> 02:26:57.820]
Latinos in cities across America to Boycott

[02:26:57.820 --> 02:27:00.000]
by walking out of their jobs, not spending any money today.

[02:27:00.420 --> 02:27:02.280]
Clear channel news, talk KFI and L.A.

[02:27:02.520 --> 02:27:04.560]
afternoon host John and Ken are responding

[02:27:04.560 --> 02:27:07.400]
by asking what's new to do just the opposite and spend heavily

[02:27:07.400 --> 02:27:10.200]
as part of their day long great Americans spend a lot promotion.

[02:27:10.680 --> 02:27:12.180]
Go out there and spend until you drop.

[02:27:12.780 --> 02:27:15.440]
The talk to our asking the listeners to fax or email a copy

[02:27:15.440 --> 02:27:18.540]
of receipt for purchases made between noon and 7 p.m.

[02:27:18.700 --> 02:27:19.660]
today at a specific time.

[02:27:19.920 --> 02:27:21.020]
And we'll then enter those receipts

[02:27:21.020 --> 02:27:23.420]
into a twice hourly drawing for reimbursement of their expenses.

[02:27:24.020 --> 02:27:24.740]
How do you like that?

[02:27:25.180 --> 02:27:25.380]
All right.

[02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:26.400]
KFI.

[02:27:26.700 --> 02:27:27.020]
Good play.

[02:27:27.220 --> 02:27:28.700]
Home temporarily of.

[02:27:28.800 --> 02:27:31.020]
Are you sure you're close personal former friend?

[02:27:31.740 --> 02:27:33.820]
Huh, 1164 votes out of pool.

[02:27:34.600 --> 02:27:36.340]
I mean, yeah, like I said before, the country has

[02:27:36.340 --> 02:27:39.120]
that immigration policy for 30, 40 years now.

[02:27:39.320 --> 02:27:40.800]
And all of a sudden there's like some rational

[02:27:40.800 --> 02:27:42.700]
or some fear or some same way to solve it.

[02:27:42.800 --> 02:27:43.300]
Of course not.

[02:27:43.780 --> 02:27:46.000]
Why not just come up with some real laws that have some teeth

[02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:47.880]
in it and just say that these people, well, you know,

[02:27:47.960 --> 02:27:48.440]
good luck to you.

[02:27:48.580 --> 02:27:48.880]
That's all.

[02:27:49.280 --> 02:27:50.180]
We'll just look the other way.

[02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:51.620]
That only because there's just too many

[02:27:51.620 --> 02:27:52.700]
we can't do anything about it.

[02:27:53.280 --> 02:27:55.540]
You found a whole bunch of Portuguese illegal aliens here

[02:27:55.540 --> 02:27:56.640]
in Canada a few weeks ago.

[02:27:56.700 --> 02:27:58.900]
Guess what they did with them deported them set it back

[02:27:58.900 --> 02:27:59.360]
to Portugal.

[02:27:59.600 --> 02:27:59.760]
Yeah.

[02:28:00.060 --> 02:28:02.220]
No, not that there aren't plenty of illegal aliens here.

[02:28:02.560 --> 02:28:03.940]
But these guys couldn't drive a cab.

[02:28:06.120 --> 02:28:07.180]
1164 votes on the pool.

[02:28:07.300 --> 02:28:09.100]
The star spangled banner should be sung.

[02:28:09.100 --> 02:28:10.740]
And they didn't like their head gear, I guess.

[02:28:11.200 --> 02:28:15.820]
In English only 693, who gives a Schmidt 169 excellent choice?

[02:28:16.220 --> 02:28:20.260]
Rarely it's a bad song 156 and has a lousy beat.

[02:28:20.660 --> 02:28:21.460]
Can't dance to it.

[02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:22.040]
Not at all.

[02:28:22.460 --> 02:28:25.500]
In any language, 128, in English or Spanish,

[02:28:25.880 --> 02:28:26.960]
trace a 13.

[02:28:27.500 --> 02:28:29.200]
And I hate this pool, so lamentate,

[02:28:29.340 --> 02:28:32.640]
Cinque, so Tanto Cinque, five got it.

[02:28:33.100 --> 02:28:33.820]
1165 vote.

[02:28:33.900 --> 02:28:36.560]
We're going to go over 1200 day during the show during the show.

[02:28:36.940 --> 02:28:37.640]
And you want to know why?

[02:28:37.640 --> 02:28:39.820]
Because these people are pissed off and fired up, baby.

[02:28:40.040 --> 02:28:40.720]
They've had it.

[02:28:40.900 --> 02:28:41.960]
They don't know what they've had it about.

[02:28:42.060 --> 02:28:43.040]
They know they're just pissed off.

[02:28:43.420 --> 02:28:45.000]
See, if the American people get this pissed off

[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:46.600]
about things that they ought to be pissed off about,

[02:28:46.680 --> 02:28:47.840]
they maybe got something done.

[02:28:48.080 --> 02:28:49.800]
And we get two stolen presidential elections

[02:28:49.800 --> 02:28:51.220]
back side by each.

[02:28:51.500 --> 02:28:53.120]
But nobody cares about that.

[02:28:53.540 --> 02:28:54.800]
And then that one early guy in the show

[02:28:54.800 --> 02:28:55.620]
liked it's a big joke.

[02:28:57.140 --> 02:28:58.120]
Very funny, pal.

[02:28:58.280 --> 02:28:59.720]
Maybe you can get up there without president

[02:28:59.720 --> 02:29:00.360]
thing next year.

[02:29:01.120 --> 02:29:02.040]
Dominique QYM, hello.

[02:29:02.420 --> 02:29:02.800]
Not there.

[02:29:04.140 --> 02:29:04.500]
56670560.

[02:29:04.800 --> 02:29:05.640]
I do like the echo though.

[02:29:05.720 --> 02:29:06.340]
I'm getting used to that.

[02:29:06.340 --> 02:29:07.560]
Especially from the beginning of the show.

[02:29:07.840 --> 02:29:08.720]
No more crossovers.

[02:29:08.960 --> 02:29:09.440]
That's it.

[02:29:09.540 --> 02:29:10.140]
We're done with that.

[02:29:10.660 --> 02:29:13.140]
That whole thing got so it's just, you know,

[02:29:13.600 --> 02:29:15.400]
we got more important things to do with that hour.

[02:29:15.500 --> 02:29:15.840]
I'm 56.

[02:29:16.180 --> 02:29:18.280]
I'm just wrapping up my part cheesy game with that hour.

[02:29:18.740 --> 02:29:20.860]
And pound five, 60 and leave a rise in singular wireless

[02:29:20.860 --> 02:29:21.220]
line.

[02:29:21.980 --> 02:29:22.600]
WDQYM, hello.

[02:29:23.600 --> 02:29:24.500]
OK, two for two.

[02:29:24.600 --> 02:29:26.000]
Let's try for triple QYM.

[02:29:26.260 --> 02:29:28.280]
Can you get a message to the gray one for me?

[02:29:29.040 --> 02:29:29.860]
Yeah, here it is.

[02:29:31.860 --> 02:29:32.460]
WDQYM, hello.

[02:29:33.980 --> 02:29:34.340]
NIO.

[02:29:34.720 --> 02:29:35.080]
Yes, sir.

[02:29:35.720 --> 02:29:36.320]
How you doing?

[02:29:36.880 --> 02:29:36.880]

[02:29:37.460 --> 02:29:38.680]
I'm just going to give you an update.

[02:29:38.940 --> 02:29:41.100]
I'm on seven street laying by my pool.

[02:29:41.440 --> 02:29:43.760]
And the horns are beeping on eighth street.

[02:29:44.180 --> 02:29:44.380]
Yeah.

[02:29:44.640 --> 02:29:46.040]
They're beeping it off.

[02:29:46.300 --> 02:29:48.200]
OK, but it is.

[02:29:48.620 --> 02:29:49.820]
It's totally incredible.

[02:29:50.060 --> 02:29:50.900]
Well, let me ask you something.

[02:29:51.080 --> 02:29:52.140]
What are the people on eighth street?

[02:29:52.200 --> 02:29:53.260]
What else has got to do with them?

[02:29:53.320 --> 02:29:54.040]
Are they here illegally?

[02:29:54.620 --> 02:29:55.340]
I don't know.

[02:29:55.660 --> 02:29:57.200]
I guess they are on my pool.

[02:29:57.200 --> 02:29:58.440]
It's a seven street beat.

[02:29:59.140 --> 02:29:59.660]
Oh, I see.

[02:29:59.720 --> 02:30:01.280]
It's a sympathy deal for them.

[02:30:01.280 --> 02:30:01.440]
Yeah.

[02:30:01.740 --> 02:30:03.800]
And they are beeping their heads off.

[02:30:03.800 --> 02:30:05.100]
OK, what I just said that.

[02:30:05.180 --> 02:30:05.420]
Thank you.

[02:30:05.520 --> 02:30:06.800]
5, 6, 7, don't fall in.

[02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:08.240]
Are they people who have been there?

[02:30:08.240 --> 02:30:08.400]
Why?

[02:30:08.620 --> 02:30:09.460]
Are they're beeping their heads off?

[02:30:09.700 --> 02:30:10.420]
That's what I'm hearing.

[02:30:10.560 --> 02:30:11.040]
They're beeping it.

[02:30:12.180 --> 02:30:12.940]
No, no, Joyce.

[02:30:13.100 --> 02:30:14.660]
We didn't say bleep and it was said beeping it.

[02:30:14.720 --> 02:30:15.420]
You got all whipped up.

[02:30:15.540 --> 02:30:15.960]
Poor Joyce.

[02:30:16.420 --> 02:30:16.600]
Bitch.

[02:30:17.520 --> 02:30:18.060]
WDQYM, hello.

[02:30:18.920 --> 02:30:20.800]
So why aren't you and him together anymore?

[02:30:20.900 --> 02:30:21.440]
No, God.

[02:30:21.940 --> 02:30:22.500]
WDQYM, hello.

[02:30:23.260 --> 02:30:24.660]
Yeah, there's one ought to be deported.

[02:30:24.660 --> 02:30:25.660]
Send it back to Wisconsin.

[02:30:25.820 --> 02:30:27.720]
Everywhere he goes, they keep sending them back to Florida.

[02:30:28.180 --> 02:30:28.500]
QYM.

[02:30:28.820 --> 02:30:30.920]
Yeah, one of the most amazing things to me in all of this

[02:30:30.920 --> 02:30:33.760]
with these illegal immigrants is the Harold, the Sun

[02:30:33.760 --> 02:30:35.200]
Sentinel, the New York.

[02:30:35.400 --> 02:30:36.880]
They call it the immigration problem.

[02:30:36.980 --> 02:30:38.960]
They used to even call it what it is.

[02:30:39.180 --> 02:30:40.200]
The illegal immigration.

[02:30:40.400 --> 02:30:41.640]
I've been saying that all along.

[02:30:41.740 --> 02:30:43.960]
This is not a rally day for immigrants.

[02:30:43.960 --> 02:30:45.780]
It's a rally day for illegal aliens.

[02:30:46.120 --> 02:30:46.260]
Right.

[02:30:46.600 --> 02:30:50.720]
I've left messages for that little mech, Tom Fiedler,

[02:30:51.180 --> 02:30:51.880]
and a few others.

[02:30:52.020 --> 02:30:53.380]
And I said, look, if you're not even,

[02:30:53.500 --> 02:30:56.000]
I mean, the coyote of people, I did hate you like poison

[02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:56.540]
at the Harold.

[02:30:56.780 --> 02:30:58.640]
If you murdered Castro on nightline,

[02:30:58.640 --> 02:30:59.500]
they still hate you.

[02:30:59.780 --> 02:31:00.980]
Stop pandering to them.

[02:31:01.300 --> 02:31:02.560]
I mean, it's illegal immigration.

[02:31:02.860 --> 02:31:04.320]
I'm all for regular immigration.

[02:31:04.780 --> 02:31:07.540]
But this is, and what, let me say, if you think

[02:31:07.540 --> 02:31:08.680]
it's been sent to Foxwood,

[02:31:08.780 --> 02:31:10.180]
saying a Mexican national anthem

[02:31:10.180 --> 02:31:11.640]
with a few changes and an English.

[02:31:12.220 --> 02:31:13.300]
Yeah, they wrote for that real big.

[02:31:13.300 --> 02:31:14.480]
OK, pal, I agree about it.

[02:31:14.560 --> 02:31:15.640]
Yeah, it's really, it's boring

[02:31:15.640 --> 02:31:17.080]
as well as what it is, really ponderous.

[02:31:17.200 --> 02:31:18.000]
We already got one.

[02:31:18.620 --> 02:31:19.180]
Yeah, it says.

[02:31:19.780 --> 02:31:22.360]
I mean, you probably made a new Mexican national anthem

[02:31:22.360 --> 02:31:22.760]
for us.

[02:31:22.760 --> 02:31:23.020]
Who did he?

[02:31:23.200 --> 02:31:23.840]
Yeah, you'll have him.

[02:31:24.380 --> 02:31:26.820]
Well, I mean, the same day I get that South Park episode

[02:31:26.820 --> 02:31:27.380]
with Oprah.

[02:31:27.380 --> 02:31:29.380]
I could download it right now, actually.

[02:31:29.560 --> 02:31:30.180]
Download what?

[02:31:30.320 --> 02:31:31.020]
The book of writing thing.

[02:31:31.100 --> 02:31:31.880]
Oh, don't do that.

[02:31:32.040 --> 02:31:33.360]
Because that spoils all the excitement.

[02:31:33.360 --> 02:31:34.100]
It's only Monday.

[02:31:34.240 --> 02:31:35.840]
We got to save something for mid week, you know,

[02:31:35.980 --> 02:31:37.020]
for the midwife in mid week.

[02:31:38.120 --> 02:31:38.920]
1172 votes, man.

[02:31:38.980 --> 02:31:40.140]
We're like on the verge of greatness

[02:31:40.140 --> 02:31:41.600]
with 1200 speaking of the great one.

[02:31:41.780 --> 02:31:42.720]
The late, the late, great one.

[02:31:43.940 --> 02:31:44.560]
WQAM, hello.

[02:31:45.120 --> 02:31:45.680]
Hey, Bill.

[02:31:45.960 --> 02:31:46.280]
Yes, sir.

[02:31:46.740 --> 02:31:47.500]
What are the next two?

[02:31:47.620 --> 02:31:48.680]
Do it there when they're laying off.

[02:31:49.680 --> 02:31:50.400]
I beg your pardon.

[02:31:50.760 --> 02:31:52.180]
What are they doing there laying out today?

[02:31:52.680 --> 02:31:53.880]
What does that mean?

[02:31:54.080 --> 02:31:54.740]
What do I don't understand?

[02:31:54.860 --> 02:31:56.060]
It's so much the joke you're not getting it.

[02:31:56.100 --> 02:31:56.720]
They don't work anyway.

[02:31:56.720 --> 02:32:01.840]
Oh, that's why I didn't get it.

[02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:03.820]
You could always save that up to last later if you want.

[02:32:04.160 --> 02:32:06.060]
Yeah, I'll save up the life for about two or three days.

[02:32:06.200 --> 02:32:07.860]
I've just thought of a real good belly laugh.

[02:32:08.140 --> 02:32:08.740]
Very funny.

[02:32:08.960 --> 02:32:09.880]
Dominique QYM, hello.

[02:32:10.740 --> 02:32:11.680]
Hey, Mom, baby.

[02:32:11.920 --> 02:32:12.000]
Yeah.

[02:32:12.100 --> 02:32:14.260]
What I said before about people who think they're funny,

[02:32:14.440 --> 02:32:16.560]
but it's not what he heard you talking about that day.

[02:32:16.780 --> 02:32:17.100]
Yeah, right.

[02:32:17.500 --> 02:32:18.920]
Dominique QYM, hello.

[02:32:19.800 --> 02:32:20.520]
Yes, Neil.

[02:32:20.820 --> 02:32:21.380]
Yes, man.

[02:32:21.720 --> 02:32:25.280]
I think it came out with a perfect solution for this problem.

[02:32:25.280 --> 02:32:26.980]
I beg your pardon?

[02:32:27.340 --> 02:32:28.740]
Yeah, I saw it for president.

[02:32:29.400 --> 02:32:30.700]
But what is this woman saying?

[02:32:30.820 --> 02:32:31.680]
What language are you asking?

[02:32:32.100 --> 02:32:32.980]
Why do you think about that?

[02:32:33.320 --> 02:32:34.440]
What do I think about what?

[02:32:34.960 --> 02:32:35.880]
Shavas for president.

[02:32:36.180 --> 02:32:37.640]
Oh, Shavas for president.

[02:32:37.680 --> 02:32:37.860]
Shavas for president.

[02:32:38.240 --> 02:32:39.540]
I mean, I don't know.

[02:32:39.540 --> 02:32:41.420]
So no, Chattel for president or Chavez.

[02:32:41.720 --> 02:32:42.780]
Chattel for president.

[02:32:42.780 --> 02:32:43.500]
Anybody with a CH?

[02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:44.800]
Che Guevara.

[02:32:45.080 --> 02:32:46.100]
Anybody with a yellow CH?

[02:32:46.680 --> 02:32:47.160]
Pucci, Cucci.

[02:32:47.740 --> 02:32:48.480]
What about what's his name?

[02:32:48.680 --> 02:32:49.200]
Pugged your Rodriguez.

[02:32:49.960 --> 02:32:50.380]
That's right.

[02:32:50.440 --> 02:32:51.100]
His ass shrunk.

[02:32:51.240 --> 02:32:51.500]
Three time.

[02:32:52.140 --> 02:32:53.640]
Hey, and listen, what about the Marlins

[02:32:53.640 --> 02:32:54.840]
that we got the Marlins fill the game

[02:32:54.840 --> 02:32:56.700]
that I thought the Marlins have some Julio's on their team?

[02:32:56.800 --> 02:32:58.300]
I would imagine I have no idea who they are.

[02:32:58.480 --> 02:32:59.760]
But Miguel Cabrera, for example.

[02:32:59.940 --> 02:33:00.360]
There you go.

[02:33:00.840 --> 02:33:01.060]
Yeah.

[02:33:01.520 --> 02:33:02.980]
Made a bigger in the game the other day.

[02:33:03.280 --> 02:33:04.200]
What about Miguel Cabrera?

[02:33:04.320 --> 02:33:05.580]
Is he going to be participating in the law?

[02:33:05.760 --> 02:33:06.180]
I guess not.

[02:33:06.540 --> 02:33:07.420]
Maybe he'll be protesting.

[02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:09.960]
I guess anybody that's making like six or seven figures

[02:33:09.960 --> 02:33:11.880]
probably isn't going to be protesting about whatever

[02:33:11.880 --> 02:33:12.440]
is going on.

[02:33:12.980 --> 02:33:15.020]
In addition to which we sure can't afford to depart.

[02:33:15.240 --> 02:33:17.020]
Deport Miguel Cabrera.

[02:33:17.200 --> 02:33:17.760]
No, we cannot.

[02:33:18.300 --> 02:33:20.300]
Because since we only got two people on the team

[02:33:20.300 --> 02:33:21.600]
that anybody ever heard of before,

[02:33:21.740 --> 02:33:22.600]
ever will hear of again.

[02:33:22.900 --> 02:33:24.000]
We sure can't be afford to do that.

[02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:25.640]
Or we just won't get no new stadium, David.

[02:33:26.080 --> 02:33:26.720]
And that's bad.

[02:33:27.540 --> 02:33:28.780]
And if we don't get no new stadium,

[02:33:28.900 --> 02:33:29.560]
you know what I'm going to do.

[02:33:29.620 --> 02:33:30.240]
I think you're bad.

[02:33:30.340 --> 02:33:30.660]
That's right.

[02:33:31.200 --> 02:33:33.100]

954 Comcast.

[02:34:28.340 --> 02:34:30.640]
This is Neil Rogers.

[02:34:31.680 --> 02:34:34.520]
This is 516-QA.

[02:34:36.740 --> 02:34:38.660]
At my junior, honey.

[02:34:40.120 --> 02:34:42.720]
This is an ABC News special report.

[02:34:43.200 --> 02:34:46.320]
Al Qaeda's leader in Iraq Abu Lassab Al-Zakali

[02:34:46.320 --> 02:34:48.680]
appeared in a rare video released today on the Internet.

[02:34:48.680 --> 02:34:50.220]
You're moving.

[02:34:52.280 --> 02:34:55.220]
You celebrate what the competition is all about.

[02:34:55.720 --> 02:34:57.900]
And you've moved me from the beginning.

[02:34:58.280 --> 02:35:01.860]
But you've got to hand some involved performance.

[02:35:02.120 --> 02:35:04.540]
Intelligence and listen Washington are examining the video.

[02:35:04.680 --> 02:35:07.080]
This has been a presentation of ABC News.

[02:35:08.020 --> 02:35:10.800]
1-31, Gully coming up at two.

[02:35:10.900 --> 02:35:12.160]
I'm sure he's going to be able to post more to mind

[02:35:12.160 --> 02:35:14.520]
that big NFL draft and on the NHL playoffs.

[02:35:14.700 --> 02:35:15.580]
Any of his nose playoffs?

[02:35:15.660 --> 02:35:16.600]
Pretty good games there.

[02:35:16.700 --> 02:35:17.340]
How about those sabres?

[02:35:17.340 --> 02:35:19.300]
I'm sure Josh is watching every second of that.

[02:35:19.560 --> 02:35:20.060]
Not one.

[02:35:20.560 --> 02:35:22.260]
How about that Maxif and again, Al, baby?

[02:35:22.700 --> 02:35:23.300]
Yeah, he's good.

[02:35:23.820 --> 02:35:24.220]
He is good.

[02:35:24.740 --> 02:35:27.740]
President George W. Bush, you are.

[02:35:28.620 --> 02:35:29.380]
What's the use?

[02:35:29.940 --> 02:35:33.460]
It's like the band-aid boy group pink.

[02:35:33.760 --> 02:35:34.540]
What's the use?

[02:35:35.400 --> 02:35:36.300]
There's no point.

[02:35:36.840 --> 02:35:37.860]
Crap happens, man.

[02:35:38.280 --> 02:35:40.160]
Just like they keep flashing out of bottom of the screen

[02:35:40.160 --> 02:35:41.900]
while they're giving this 85 hours of coverage.

[02:35:42.480 --> 02:35:45.340]
This national immigrant day with that immigrant thing.

[02:35:45.640 --> 02:35:46.120]
They keep saying.

[02:35:46.120 --> 02:35:47.940]
They keep saying, it's not going to affect

[02:35:47.940 --> 02:35:48.880]
the national economy.

[02:35:49.680 --> 02:35:50.040]
No.

[02:35:50.780 --> 02:35:51.860]
So what's the point?

[02:35:52.220 --> 02:35:53.140]
What's the point then?

[02:35:53.560 --> 02:35:54.320]
Assuming that they're right.

[02:35:54.400 --> 02:35:55.260]
And it's not going to offend the national?

[02:35:55.520 --> 02:35:57.700]
Well, other than proving that they can screw off

[02:35:57.700 --> 02:35:59.420]
from work, we got people right here at QA.

[02:35:59.480 --> 02:36:00.900]
And we screw off from work, whatever they feel like.

[02:36:01.740 --> 02:36:02.980]
Maybe that's the whole idea.

[02:36:03.300 --> 02:36:04.160]
Maybe that's the protest.

[02:36:04.800 --> 02:36:05.340]
Oh, is that it?

[02:36:05.800 --> 02:36:07.160]
Well, maybe we'll go back to work.

[02:36:07.300 --> 02:36:08.620]
Somebody's going to say, hey, screw you.

[02:36:08.760 --> 02:36:10.500]
Now it's turn around a bitch.

[02:36:11.100 --> 02:36:14.440]
President George W. has approved Dubai's $1.24 billion

[02:36:14.860 --> 02:36:17.660]
takeover of Don Casters, a British engineering company

[02:36:17.660 --> 02:36:19.300]
with US plants that supply the Pentagon,

[02:36:19.500 --> 02:36:20.280]
the White House and Friday.

[02:36:20.860 --> 02:36:22.440]
You see, they couldn't get the other Dubai port

[02:36:22.440 --> 02:36:23.080]
scale through.

[02:36:23.260 --> 02:36:25.480]
So now, by hook or by crook, see the way they do it?

[02:36:25.580 --> 02:36:26.200]
One way or two other.

[02:36:26.580 --> 02:36:26.980]
That's right.

[02:36:27.160 --> 02:36:28.760]
The decision announced by one house spokesman,

[02:36:28.760 --> 02:36:30.300]
Scott McClendon, followed a congressional

[02:36:30.300 --> 02:36:33.440]
uproar over security fears that sculled another Dubai state

[02:36:33.440 --> 02:36:34.900]
on companies planned to acquire operations

[02:36:34.900 --> 02:36:35.880]
at major US ports.

[02:36:36.420 --> 02:36:38.860]
The Interagency Committee on Foreign Investments

[02:36:38.860 --> 02:36:40.500]
in the US and its confidential recommendation

[02:36:40.500 --> 02:36:42.280]
that the Dubai takeover of Don Casters

[02:36:42.280 --> 02:36:43.240]
to Bush April 13.

[02:36:44.140 --> 02:36:46.360]
Bush's decision followed around with goes on and on.

[02:36:46.580 --> 02:36:47.360]
The right goes.

[02:36:48.860 --> 02:36:50.940]
The Bushes and the Bin Laden's baby,

[02:36:51.160 --> 02:36:53.940]
the Bushes and what's his name, Bandar Bush,

[02:36:54.220 --> 02:36:55.360]
all of them Saudi rag here.

[02:36:55.500 --> 02:36:56.340]
That's what it's all about.

[02:36:56.540 --> 02:36:57.320]
All about oil.

[02:36:57.480 --> 02:36:57.960]
What did I tell you?

[02:36:58.040 --> 02:36:59.100]
Is the minute they went in there,

[02:36:59.220 --> 02:37:01.040]
OIL and MONY, and people said,

[02:37:01.180 --> 02:37:02.380]
what is that fact now, huh?

[02:37:02.760 --> 02:37:03.280]
Nighttender that?

[02:37:03.600 --> 02:37:04.020]
Yeah, you did.

[02:37:04.540 --> 02:37:07.160]
And the growing international crisis over

[02:37:07.160 --> 02:37:08.160]
Rand's nuclear program,

[02:37:08.160 --> 02:37:10.500]
contributed catastrophic oil price spike,

[02:37:10.760 --> 02:37:13.000]
sending crude prices over $100 a barrel.

[02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:14.040]
Oh my God.

[02:37:14.120 --> 02:37:15.520]
Senior Wall Street analysts are warning.

[02:37:16.440 --> 02:37:18.380]
With prices already around 72 bucks a barrel,

[02:37:18.380 --> 02:37:20.320]
such an increase could mean drivers facing prices.

[02:37:20.960 --> 02:37:23.000]
Of obviously, now this is a British thing,

[02:37:23.060 --> 02:37:23.960]
so I don't know what that means.

[02:37:24.360 --> 02:37:26.260]
According to the Petrol Retailers Association.

[02:37:26.980 --> 02:37:28.100]
Last week, Lord Brown,

[02:37:28.300 --> 02:37:31.940]
chief executive of BP, one that prices could rise to a pound.

[02:37:32.340 --> 02:37:34.720]
As the unveiled bumper, that's a pound a liter.

[02:37:35.220 --> 02:37:37.120]
Well, that's the pound a liter would be about four pounds

[02:37:37.120 --> 02:37:38.760]
and a pound is almost two bucks.

[02:37:39.180 --> 02:37:40.860]
See what I'm with that translates to a gallon?

[02:37:41.160 --> 02:37:41.600]
Eight bucks.

[02:37:41.800 --> 02:37:42.340]
Yeah, there you go.

[02:37:42.340 --> 02:37:43.940]
So if you think it's bad, a three bucks,

[02:37:43.940 --> 02:37:45.300]
or three, a little over three,

[02:37:45.560 --> 02:37:46.860]
how are you gonna like it with eight bucks a gallon?

[02:37:47.040 --> 02:37:49.680]
See, 16 times eight is $100 a gallon.

[02:37:49.780 --> 02:37:50.960]
I'm sorry, 128.

[02:37:51.800 --> 02:37:52.100]
Is that right?

[02:37:52.580 --> 02:37:53.440]
I'll take your word for it.

[02:37:53.480 --> 02:37:54.180]
I'm so good at it, man.

[02:37:54.340 --> 02:37:54.900]
Yeah, 128.

[02:37:55.520 --> 02:37:55.760]
I'm so good at that.

[02:37:55.860 --> 02:37:57.840]
128 bucks to fill up a 16 gallon tank.

[02:37:57.960 --> 02:37:59.220]
Well, thanks a lot, Mr. President.

[02:37:59.920 --> 02:38:01.560]
A single political shock could be enough

[02:38:01.560 --> 02:38:02.900]
to send oil markets into panic

[02:38:02.900 --> 02:38:03.800]
since Adam Semensky,

[02:38:04.180 --> 02:38:06.520]
senior energy economist at Deutsche Bank in New York.

[02:38:07.120 --> 02:38:08.280]
If we have one more big problem,

[02:38:08.280 --> 02:38:10.000]
we're gonna have triple digit oil prices.

[02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:11.700]
As he points to confrontation with Iran,

[02:38:12.300 --> 02:38:14.080]
a worsening of the situation in Iraq,

[02:38:14.460 --> 02:38:15.780]
or recurrence of devastating hurricanes

[02:38:15.780 --> 02:38:16.760]
in the Gulf of Mexico

[02:38:16.760 --> 02:38:19.300]
as potential catalyst for a major rise.

[02:38:20.140 --> 02:38:20.960]
And he also said,

[02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:22.280]
you're mama's those socks in the hill.

[02:38:22.420 --> 02:38:23.080]
Whatever you might buy that.

[02:38:23.140 --> 02:38:23.920]
How do you like that, huh?

[02:38:24.340 --> 02:38:25.680]
He said, what do you think of those Saudis?

[02:38:25.680 --> 02:38:26.380]
And this guy said,

[02:38:26.580 --> 02:38:27.100]
hubbim and dread.

[02:38:29.140 --> 02:38:30.400]
5670560, pound 560,

[02:38:30.400 --> 02:38:32.320]
and they've arrived in singular wireless line.

[02:38:32.380 --> 02:38:34.040]
We got 1199 on there.

[02:38:34.120 --> 02:38:37.080]
The 1200 vote today gets a big prize, okay?

[02:38:37.440 --> 02:38:37.900]
Do you believe it?

[02:38:38.240 --> 02:38:38.640]
Not believe it.

[02:38:38.640 --> 02:38:39.220]
No.

[02:38:40.060 --> 02:38:40.900]
1201, see it,

[02:38:40.900 --> 02:38:42.720]
but it hopped over, see a little hop over.

[02:38:42.880 --> 02:38:44.560]
Went from 1199 to 1201.

[02:38:44.800 --> 02:38:46.500]
Whoever was in there at 1200, we apologize.

[02:38:46.940 --> 02:38:48.140]
We were gonna like freeze it right there

[02:38:48.140 --> 02:38:48.980]
and check out who it was

[02:38:48.980 --> 02:38:50.800]
and bring you like a million dollars cash

[02:38:50.800 --> 02:38:51.800]
and small bills to your house.

[02:38:51.900 --> 02:38:52.540]
But too late.

[02:38:53.440 --> 02:38:54.380]
How many QAM, hello?

[02:38:56.060 --> 02:38:57.800]
QAM, deadline one, man.

[02:38:57.900 --> 02:38:59.120]
Mark it down a little bit of a problem.

[02:38:59.400 --> 02:39:01.420]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[02:39:02.040 --> 02:39:03.940]
Woo, wee, man, it is good.

[02:39:04.460 --> 02:39:06.180]
It is really good to be working in this place.

[02:39:07.660 --> 02:39:09.480]
5670560, pound 560 in the Verizon

[02:39:10.020 --> 02:39:11.540]
and singular wireless line.

[02:39:11.620 --> 02:39:13.540]
It's Banjo Boy Group Inc, baby.

[02:39:14.020 --> 02:39:16.460]
And maybe your greatest invention of all time.

[02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.680]
B-B-T-I, Banjo Boy Group Incorporate.

[02:39:20.520 --> 02:39:22.180]
Where, where, where, yeah, he beat me again.

[02:39:22.360 --> 02:39:25.380]
I was just, I was just, I was just reaching for it.

[02:39:25.540 --> 02:39:26.680]
I love that part too, right?

[02:39:26.980 --> 02:39:28.060]
I was just gonna write a strumming.

[02:39:28.640 --> 02:39:29.480]
W-Q-A-M.

[02:39:29.900 --> 02:39:31.080]
I love you, Neil.

[02:39:31.640 --> 02:39:31.800]
Yeah.

[02:39:33.080 --> 02:39:34.220]
Okay, good call.

[02:39:34.800 --> 02:39:35.720]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:39:36.380 --> 02:39:37.100]
Q-A-M.

[02:39:37.440 --> 02:39:38.660]
Yeah, hello, Neil.

[02:39:38.780 --> 02:39:39.500]
Yeah, yes sir.

[02:39:39.640 --> 02:39:40.160]
How are you doing?

[02:39:40.520 --> 02:39:40.820]
Okay.

[02:39:41.060 --> 02:39:43.580]
Uh-uh, he called me off-guard, I've been sitting on the phone

[02:39:43.580 --> 02:39:43.740]
for a while.

[02:39:43.740 --> 02:39:45.640]
Now I'll come back a minute later on when you got something to say.

[02:39:46.580 --> 02:39:47.500]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:39:47.880 --> 02:39:49.640]
I'm not, I'm not speaking for someone.

[02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:51.600]
Oh, there, it's not like there's a strumming on a guitar.

[02:39:53.140 --> 02:39:54.660]
Is this the right thing to say?

[02:39:54.760 --> 02:39:57.260]
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.

[02:39:57.540 --> 02:39:58.840]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:39:58.980 --> 02:39:59.780]
That is the G.

[02:40:00.180 --> 02:40:02.260]
Yeah, W-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:40:02.680 --> 02:40:03.820]
Hey, nearly happy Monday, buddy.

[02:40:04.100 --> 02:40:04.580]
Back to you.

[02:40:04.580 --> 02:40:06.320]
I've been in that a lot, my truck all day.

[02:40:06.640 --> 02:40:08.540]
Did you see the thing, I think it was in the Boston World

[02:40:08.540 --> 02:40:11.700]
where something about, about how bush sign, like 750 laws

[02:40:11.700 --> 02:40:12.500]
and all those laws?

[02:40:12.500 --> 02:40:14.300]
It was on our website, it's old news, yeah.

[02:40:15.080 --> 02:40:18.940]
No, it didn't sign 750, broke 750 laws, get it right, Schmuck.

[02:40:19.400 --> 02:40:21.480]
He broke 750 laws, it's right on our website.

[02:40:21.680 --> 02:40:23.000]
Even Josh remembers that story, right?

[02:40:23.360 --> 02:40:24.000]
Yeah, I remember that one.

[02:40:24.340 --> 02:40:26.420]
God, what is wrong with you people anyway?

[02:40:27.740 --> 02:40:30.260]
That's the American, forget about the Star Spangled Banner.

[02:40:30.660 --> 02:40:34.100]
That's the National Anthem and you know, something that transcends all languages.

[02:40:34.520 --> 02:40:34.840]
That's right.

[02:40:35.320 --> 02:40:37.600]
Even Sanskrit, it all comes out the same.

[02:40:38.300 --> 02:40:40.080]
That's it, that's the American National Anthem.

[02:40:40.620 --> 02:40:42.240]
Right, that'll be the Bupin about.

[02:40:42.900 --> 02:40:46.060]
That's it, work on it, practice it, sing it loudly.

[02:40:46.860 --> 02:40:47.860]
70 Q-A-M, hello.

[02:40:49.460 --> 02:40:50.100]
Hey, how's it going?

[02:40:50.480 --> 02:40:50.800]
Yes sir.

[02:40:51.480 --> 02:40:54.840]
Hey, is this the Dolphin and I thought a draft post came true?

[02:40:54.840 --> 02:40:57.060]
No, it's not, that's coming up in two.

[02:40:57.640 --> 02:40:59.500]
Hey, are you clear?

[02:41:00.380 --> 02:41:00.680]
Jesus.

[02:41:01.200 --> 02:41:02.080]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:41:02.520 --> 02:41:05.640]
Ar-Hali-Sto-N-O-T-R-A-E.

[02:41:10.280 --> 02:41:11.960]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:41:12.340 --> 02:41:12.760]
Hey, Neil.

[02:41:13.300 --> 02:41:16.080]
You know, they're doing illegal stuff anyway.

[02:41:16.280 --> 02:41:19.800]
Think about it, the big companies are having these phone operations from India.

[02:41:20.240 --> 02:41:22.880]
Right, that's what it's called outsourcing is an ice name for it.

[02:41:22.880 --> 02:41:26.240]
It means what they're doing is taking your jobs and they're giving to a lot of other

[02:41:26.240 --> 02:41:26.340]
people.

[02:41:26.340 --> 02:41:30.340]
Yeah, the one with the papers, at least to these people, we get some money to find some

[02:41:30.340 --> 02:41:31.460]
of our products in their industry.

[02:41:32.240 --> 02:41:32.420]
Yeah.

[02:41:32.820 --> 02:41:34.700]
I mean, if the people in their country identify that.

[02:41:34.700 --> 02:41:37.600]
So in other words, you're saying we shouldn't have an immigration policy, which is

[02:41:37.600 --> 02:41:40.980]
what anybody gets here, we should just give them an honesty and have a workers program

[02:41:40.980 --> 02:41:42.760]
for anybody who can crawl into the borders, you idiot.

[02:41:43.260 --> 02:41:43.900]
Jesus, God.

[02:41:44.460 --> 02:41:45.580]
There, there, there for another words.

[02:41:45.700 --> 02:41:48.780]
As long as we're outsourcing, as long as that's bad and take it away, we're conjunct.

[02:41:48.960 --> 02:41:50.600]
Let's just let all these sluppers come in here.

[02:41:50.600 --> 02:41:53.360]
And by the way, make a whole bunch of babies because keep the Pope happy.

[02:41:53.660 --> 02:41:56.360]
Now, that's another thing that nobody even factors in, you know.

[02:41:56.900 --> 02:42:00.800]
All these illegal aliens who come from Latin America with their 17 children and each

[02:42:00.800 --> 02:42:04.620]
one of them is going to have another 15, 20 children because the Pope keeps telling them

[02:42:04.620 --> 02:42:07.020]
about it, but it will make a lot of Catholic babies, baby.

[02:42:07.460 --> 02:42:08.500]
You know about that.

[02:42:09.180 --> 02:42:10.160]
But that's why that's why.

[02:42:10.400 --> 02:42:12.380]
Listen, why do you think that happened?

[02:42:13.020 --> 02:42:16.020]
You think he's going to sit back and let you have go through life with one kid?

[02:42:16.160 --> 02:42:17.060]
He's not going to permit that.

[02:42:17.220 --> 02:42:18.160]
I didn't meet my quota.

[02:42:18.740 --> 02:42:20.160]
You didn't even come close.

[02:42:20.520 --> 02:42:23.200]
He was staring to think you were like Chinese or something like that.

[02:42:23.560 --> 02:42:25.200]
So we put a different slant on your life.

[02:42:25.460 --> 02:42:27.640]
This is Neil Rogers.

[02:42:28.260 --> 02:42:30.600]
Fox solid is 5.62.

[02:42:31.320 --> 02:42:31.540]
8.

[02:42:48.160 --> 02:42:50.160]
2.

[02:43:23.240 --> 02:43:24.000]
3.

[02:43:24.440 --> 02:43:24.440]

[02:43:24.440 --> 02:43:25.020]
4.

[02:43:25.020 --> 02:43:25.020]

[02:43:25.020 --> 02:43:25.020]

[02:43:25.020 --> 02:43:25.020]

[02:43:26.220 --> 02:43:26.220]

[02:43:26.280 --> 02:43:26.280]

[02:43:26.480 --> 02:43:26.480]

[02:43:30.620 --> 02:43:30.620]

[02:43:30.620 --> 02:43:30.620]

[02:43:32.100 --> 02:43:32.100]

[02:43:32.140 --> 02:43:32.140]

[02:43:32.140 --> 02:43:43.080]
You know what I mean about people reproducing, overproduced-area classic example right there?

[02:43:44.160 --> 02:43:45.540]
She's pregnant again, good old Brittany.

[02:44:09.120 --> 02:44:11.160]
Maybe you can drop both of them at the same time.

[02:44:11.720 --> 02:44:12.360]
It's all over for her.

[02:44:13.400 --> 02:44:14.140]
I'm not good.

[02:44:14.520 --> 02:44:15.240]
Try it again tomorrow.

[02:44:15.640 --> 02:44:17.540]
Way fewer people hanging out at pick-up trucks today.

[02:44:18.500 --> 02:44:21.820]
5667-0560, but it's business really slow with those cock fights in

[02:44:21.820 --> 02:44:22.260]
Hylia.

[02:44:22.600 --> 02:44:25.180]
Tom died of 60 and he was rising in the singular wireless line.

[02:44:25.860 --> 02:44:26.780]
WDQ-YM, hello.

[02:44:27.760 --> 02:44:28.340]
Q-A-N.

[02:44:28.880 --> 02:44:30.100]
Oh, is that a nice sound?

[02:44:30.540 --> 02:44:31.120]
Nice, clean.

[02:44:32.140 --> 02:44:32.960]
Sound of death.

[02:44:33.780 --> 02:44:34.640]
WDQ-YM, hello.

[02:44:35.400 --> 02:44:36.660]
Hey, Neil, how you doing today?

[02:44:36.820 --> 02:44:37.240]
Okay, sir.

[02:44:37.660 --> 02:44:39.740]
I've heard something important today about my business.

[02:44:40.340 --> 02:44:44.320]
Those guys didn't show up to work today and I think I can run it by myself.

[02:44:44.520 --> 02:44:45.460]
I may not need them.

[02:44:45.540 --> 02:44:46.300]
There you go, excellent.

[02:44:46.580 --> 02:44:48.020]
Why weren't something kind of important today?

[02:44:48.340 --> 02:44:49.400]
Look how much you're going to save, man.

[02:44:49.680 --> 02:44:50.060]
There you go.

[02:44:50.300 --> 02:44:51.040]
You have a great day, sir.

[02:44:51.160 --> 02:44:51.780]
Send half to us.

[02:44:51.940 --> 02:44:52.240]
Thank you.

[02:44:52.660 --> 02:44:53.140]
There you go.

[02:44:53.260 --> 02:44:57.600]
Maybe some of these people will show up to how unneeded they are.

[02:44:58.500 --> 02:44:59.320]
Think that's possible?

[02:44:59.820 --> 02:45:00.160]
Oh, sorry.

[02:45:00.800 --> 02:45:02.400]
Anybody at Q-A-N not show up?

[02:45:03.100 --> 02:45:04.380]
Everybody in this corner of the building.

[02:45:04.760 --> 02:45:06.420]
Everybody at Q-A-N showed up today.

[02:45:07.040 --> 02:45:09.540]
None of our people out there marching or playing golf or

[02:45:09.540 --> 02:45:13.580]
screwing off trying to like, you know, the big O not only was he on this morning, but then

[02:45:13.580 --> 02:45:15.540]
again later on right before our show.

[02:45:16.040 --> 02:45:16.640]
That's right.

[02:45:16.980 --> 02:45:20.240]
I'm tape, of course, but nevertheless, that's his anti-his protest.

[02:45:20.420 --> 02:45:21.240]
He was doing double duty.

[02:45:21.680 --> 02:45:22.700]
He was doing a double duty.

[02:45:22.800 --> 02:45:24.000]
I think I heard you do that, David.

[02:45:24.440 --> 02:45:24.820]
560.

[02:45:25.520 --> 02:45:25.920]
460.

[02:45:26.540 --> 02:45:26.940]
560.

[02:45:27.180 --> 02:45:28.140]
And they've arrived in Singular.

[02:45:28.740 --> 02:45:29.540]
Wireless line.

[02:45:30.300 --> 02:45:32.860]
It's a big day for the Irish, baby.

[02:45:33.360 --> 02:45:35.000]
The whole thing is just so stupid.

[02:45:35.120 --> 02:45:35.660]
It's just pathetic.

[02:45:35.920 --> 02:45:36.740]
It's just tragic.

[02:45:36.740 --> 02:45:40.740]
I'm looking at these people and they got their American flags and a lot of Mexican flags.

[02:45:41.280 --> 02:45:43.920]
And then they all got these pre-made cardboard signs or hold up.

[02:45:44.200 --> 02:45:47.040]
And they're waving to the cameras and posturing the cameras and yadda yadda.

[02:45:47.400 --> 02:45:47.840]
Oh, look at that.

[02:45:47.960 --> 02:45:50.400]
There's Luis Alberto Diarrhea, author of the Devil's Highway.

[02:45:50.900 --> 02:45:52.700]
Luis Alberto of the Devil's Highway.

[02:45:52.960 --> 02:45:54.420]
And that's exactly what it is, man.

[02:45:54.720 --> 02:45:55.420]
They got those tunnels.

[02:45:57.080 --> 02:46:01.100]
I still say, man, can't they just close them tunnels up?

[02:46:01.420 --> 02:46:02.140]
It makes sense to you.

[02:46:02.440 --> 02:46:02.820]
Sure does.

[02:46:03.360 --> 02:46:04.480]
No, they keep digging more.

[02:46:04.660 --> 02:46:05.300]
You know, they're hard workers.

[02:46:05.300 --> 02:46:07.440]
Yeah, it's hard work.

[02:46:07.540 --> 02:46:08.680]
W-Q-Y-M, hello.

[02:46:09.120 --> 02:46:09.900]
The camera's here.

[02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:10.240]
Hey, Dale.

[02:46:10.680 --> 02:46:11.040]
Yes, sir.

[02:46:11.600 --> 02:46:11.860]
Yeah.

[02:46:12.700 --> 02:46:15.000]
Shouldn't lunch live on the end jail right now.

[02:46:15.480 --> 02:46:19.660]
Yes, but again, the guy to call before that was all bad out of shape about Duke and the other half.

[02:46:19.920 --> 02:46:21.400]
That's the guy he should have been talking about.

[02:46:21.760 --> 02:46:23.420]
Rich White guys like Lardass, Limbaugh.

[02:46:23.520 --> 02:46:24.420]
Okay, Rich Pill-Pop and...

[02:46:24.420 --> 02:46:25.660]
People could have called.

[02:46:25.800 --> 02:46:25.800]

[02:46:26.140 --> 02:46:27.940]
Like Lardass, should be in jail.

[02:46:28.060 --> 02:46:29.980]
But he got a tap on a wrist and no surprise.

[02:46:30.500 --> 02:46:32.500]
You really expecting he was going to do jail time or anything?

[02:46:32.960 --> 02:46:33.280]
No.

[02:46:33.620 --> 02:46:34.100]
Of course not.

[02:46:34.620 --> 02:46:35.600]
W-Q-Y-M, hello.

[02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:36.140]
Dale.

[02:46:36.720 --> 02:46:37.020]
Yes, sir.

[02:46:37.380 --> 02:46:42.100]
Unfortunately, the truth is they don't tell you who the organizers are among these people,

[02:46:42.760 --> 02:46:47.060]
the left-wing, the communist, you know, is making some...

[02:46:47.060 --> 02:46:48.880]
The New Black Panthers are behind us, too.

[02:46:49.380 --> 02:46:49.780]
Did you...

[02:46:49.780 --> 02:46:51.140]
What is that all about?

[02:46:51.140 --> 02:46:52.900]
to New Black Panthers. What the hell is that?

[02:46:53.220 --> 02:46:56.480]
What has a back and offshoot of the Black Panthers?

[02:46:56.580 --> 02:46:59.480]
No, that's original, but what the hell is the need for that?

[02:47:00.220 --> 02:47:02.440]
We already got Jesse Jackson, what do we need them for?

[02:47:03.280 --> 02:47:05.780]
Sturvoge or racial craft? The New Black Panthers in North Carolina,

[02:47:05.780 --> 02:47:08.380]
because of what allegedly happened to Duke, the alleged rape

[02:47:08.380 --> 02:47:11.560]
from his brother's credibility on a scale of zero is minus infinity.

[02:47:12.020 --> 02:47:13.900]
And right away, let's turn into a big racial thing.

[02:47:14.720 --> 02:47:16.540]
Let's go out and attach him to La Crosse players.

[02:47:16.760 --> 02:47:19.940]
What do you say? That's a plan. There you go. Let's rape him.

[02:47:19.940 --> 02:47:22.240]
There, or you just take him out to the nearest tree.

[02:47:22.340 --> 02:47:23.500]
They'll just be hanging for a while.

[02:47:24.580 --> 02:47:26.320]
1224 votes. That's pretty damn impressive.

[02:47:26.540 --> 02:47:26.960]
Yes, me.

[02:47:27.320 --> 02:47:29.180]
National Anthem, man, it's a piece of crap.

[02:47:29.320 --> 02:47:33.240]
It's a bad song. Even Francis Scott Key and what kind of name is that like Francis?

[02:47:33.620 --> 02:47:34.800]
Except for Francis over here.

[02:47:35.480 --> 02:47:38.180]
The star-spangled batter should be sung in English only.

[02:47:38.420 --> 02:47:40.660]
Speaking English, speaking English, 722.

[02:47:41.380 --> 02:47:42.920]
Who gives this from it? 186.

[02:47:43.540 --> 02:47:45.940]
Rarely, it's a bad song. It's as little as possible, 162.

[02:47:46.680 --> 02:47:49.880]
And quit that invocation at the ballgame, too, at the dolphin games, you idiots.

[02:47:50.380 --> 02:47:55.040]
The NFL, with their immigrant, with their invocation.

[02:47:55.320 --> 02:47:59.280]
How about an immigration invocation? Only illegal illegals can sing it.

[02:47:59.740 --> 02:48:02.020]
In any language, 136, it sounds the same.

[02:48:02.460 --> 02:48:04.360]
English or Spanish, still 13, Tracy.

[02:48:04.580 --> 02:48:06.660]
It has moved in a long time now. Remember Tracy?

[02:48:07.160 --> 02:48:09.160]
Who? And I hit this pool of five, Tracy Caracito.

[02:48:09.320 --> 02:48:09.540]
Oh, yeah.

[02:48:10.040 --> 02:48:11.840]
Kind of a name was that, by the way, Caracito.

[02:48:11.940 --> 02:48:13.620]
That sounded a little bit like one of your people.

[02:48:14.460 --> 02:48:16.660]
Oh, it was a fan, and he was a fan, you're from it's,

[02:48:16.720 --> 02:48:20.380]
a fan, you're a fan, you're, he may have been spoke with a little bit of a defect.

[02:48:20.620 --> 02:48:22.100]
He did, and he played Highline.

[02:48:23.080 --> 02:48:25.140]
He had a Palota and a Sesta.

[02:48:25.520 --> 02:48:27.960]
Wow. You know what they say? In Sesta is Vesta.

[02:48:28.200 --> 02:48:29.840]
That's what they say at the Palota place.

[02:48:29.880 --> 02:48:30.980]
What your sister to the testa?

[02:48:31.380 --> 02:48:35.160]
Right. Well, I don't want to get Joyce all that out of shape now.

[02:48:35.320 --> 02:48:36.740]
See, you almost learned me tonight.

[02:48:36.980 --> 02:48:38.480]
I went down the old Hershey Highway.

[02:48:38.640 --> 02:48:39.780]
It was bad. It's so easy.

[02:48:39.900 --> 02:48:41.960]
Now, I kept my honor.

[02:48:41.960 --> 02:48:44.260]
I restrained myself. That's right.

[02:48:44.760 --> 02:48:46.160]
W-W-W-Q-A-M. Hello.

[02:48:47.020 --> 02:48:48.140]
That is Q-A-M?

[02:48:48.480 --> 02:48:49.700]
Yes, sir. Q-A-M.

[02:48:50.040 --> 02:48:51.300]
This is really Clark.

[02:48:51.940 --> 02:48:52.320]
Who's that?

[02:48:52.640 --> 02:48:55.500]
I got to come into make about demonstration.

[02:48:56.120 --> 02:48:57.680]
And what is that? What'd you like to say?

[02:48:58.120 --> 02:49:02.640]
I like to say, we are two to become in the land of the Himphideos.

[02:49:03.660 --> 02:49:08.200]
And we have to demonstrate out on the street to support long breakers.

[02:49:08.500 --> 02:49:10.120]
They're excellent. Very well put, sir.

[02:49:10.120 --> 02:49:12.820]
In Fidel and how with Fidel too, while you're at it.

[02:49:12.980 --> 02:49:14.960]
Having a big made it. I don't think it's any coincidence.

[02:49:15.240 --> 02:49:17.200]
I think this guy before would just come at least to come at this day.

[02:49:17.280 --> 02:49:17.760]
Had a good point.

[02:49:18.120 --> 02:49:19.820]
I think the commies are coming back. Don't you?

[02:49:19.900 --> 02:49:20.920]
I'll find one under every rock.

[02:49:21.900 --> 02:49:22.940]
Especially in Hylia.

[02:49:23.640 --> 02:49:26.600]
Steve Faction says they just got back from Luchabai local deli.

[02:49:26.720 --> 02:49:28.300]
All the immigrants were in the kitchen working away.

[02:49:28.440 --> 02:49:30.460]
Well, excellent. Actually, some immigrant.

[02:49:31.520 --> 02:49:35.520]
I see it's very difficult because they keep confusing immigrants or legal aliens.

[02:49:35.760 --> 02:49:35.880]
Okay.

[02:49:36.400 --> 02:49:38.220]
Who did know for immigration?

[02:49:38.220 --> 02:49:40.960]
Okay. One delivered my lunch at the table on my way there.

[02:49:41.140 --> 02:49:43.920]
I passed. What is it? I think he said past.

[02:49:44.180 --> 02:49:46.580]
I pasted some other immigrants moving lawns and building houses.

[02:49:46.580 --> 02:49:47.720]
I believe he means past.

[02:49:48.160 --> 02:49:50.000]
He says pasted. He pasted them.

[02:49:50.380 --> 02:49:52.000]
I would imagine the immigrants who are protesting.

[02:49:52.200 --> 02:49:53.660]
You're just looking for another reason to have a day off.

[02:49:53.800 --> 02:49:54.500]
I think that's it.

[02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:56.180]
I supported an American deli.

[02:49:56.240 --> 02:49:58.200]
The day in life, I'll go on with immigrants. Go to work or not.

[02:49:58.620 --> 02:50:01.240]
I think if the illegal immigrants would spend as much time trying to become legal

[02:50:01.240 --> 02:50:04.240]
US citizens that they are protesting, they might not be out of a day's work.

[02:50:04.560 --> 02:50:05.620]
And what about the companies that are.

[02:50:05.620 --> 02:50:06.740]
Yeah, that's a good point.

[02:50:06.920 --> 02:50:11.680]
If these people are working for such starvation wages, how can they afford to be taken off today?

[02:50:12.160 --> 02:50:13.680]
We sure as hell couldn't be afford to take it off.

[02:50:13.780 --> 02:50:14.640]
They even go play golf.

[02:50:14.960 --> 02:50:15.720]
I know I couldn't.

[02:50:15.780 --> 02:50:16.760]
The way Jose.

[02:50:17.500 --> 02:50:19.800]
Even with his new contract, Josh Cordist still showed up.

[02:50:20.340 --> 02:50:22.020]
So, shouldn't they be held accountable in some way?

[02:50:22.120 --> 02:50:24.340]
What a wacky country this has become and says Steve.

[02:50:24.520 --> 02:50:25.220]
And Steve, you are.

[02:50:25.320 --> 02:50:26.320]
I'm so resistant.

[02:50:27.080 --> 02:50:28.700]
You're finger right on it and it is Steve.

[02:50:29.280 --> 02:50:30.000]
He twisted away.

[02:50:30.780 --> 02:50:32.040]
Twist in the right away. Who did that?

[02:50:32.220 --> 02:50:33.080]
Twist in the right away.

[02:50:33.480 --> 02:50:34.000]
Who did that?

[02:50:34.240 --> 02:50:34.580]
Same cook.

[02:50:34.580 --> 02:50:35.480]
Am I right?

[02:50:35.840 --> 02:50:36.300]
I'm checking.

[02:50:36.760 --> 02:50:37.760]
No, you're not going to have that.

[02:50:37.960 --> 02:50:39.620]
That's, we've got to be a 50 song, ain't it?

[02:50:39.640 --> 02:50:40.780]
Or maybe early 60s.

[02:50:41.100 --> 02:50:41.940]
I'm going to look it up.

[02:50:42.180 --> 02:50:42.480]
Oh.

[02:50:47.080 --> 02:50:48.440]
That's not my sam cook to me.

[02:50:48.580 --> 02:50:48.840]
It is.

[02:50:49.240 --> 02:50:49.760]
It is.

[02:50:49.760 --> 02:50:49.760]

[02:50:51.920 --> 02:50:52.280]
62.

[02:50:53.880 --> 02:50:55.200]
What a man we man.

[02:50:55.980 --> 02:50:56.400]
We Sam.

[02:50:56.900 --> 02:50:59.160]
Oh, you don't seem to worry about shouting the motel or something.

[02:50:59.460 --> 02:51:00.860]
Okay, that's enough of Sam cook.

[02:51:01.040 --> 02:51:01.620]
Who did you go to bed?

[02:51:01.880 --> 02:51:03.040]
You want to know Bobby Duranau.

[02:51:03.040 --> 02:51:05.140]
And he sure as hell wasn't no Dianne Woolworth.

[02:51:05.240 --> 02:51:06.460]
He didn't have no psychic hotline.

[02:51:06.720 --> 02:51:08.840]
This is Neil Rogers.

[02:51:09.260 --> 02:51:12.040]
What, what, what solid is 516 QA?

[02:51:12.760 --> 02:51:13.120]
Holy crap.

[02:51:14.440 --> 02:51:14.960]
Holy crap.

[02:51:14.960 --> 02:51:15.500]
The God.

[02:51:15.900 --> 02:51:18.080]
We want the world for me and the earth.

[02:51:18.660 --> 02:51:21.440]
We'll cut your grass for me and the earth.

[02:51:22.380 --> 02:51:25.240]
Well, they have the best and everything.

[02:51:25.940 --> 02:51:29.980]
And don't they come and do America to cut your lawn.

[02:51:29.980 --> 02:51:33.820]
They'll make your leaves and wash your car.

[02:51:34.260 --> 02:51:36.980]
Trying to avoid the ill-gracious star.

[02:51:37.920 --> 02:51:41.600]
They'll boil it up and they'll stop it.

[02:51:42.580 --> 02:51:44.280]
They'll stop it.

[02:51:44.280 --> 02:51:47.760]
I used to wear things into one with a job.

[02:51:47.940 --> 02:51:52.940]
We won't give all the kids a baby to download or two.

[02:51:53.340 --> 02:51:56.480]
We can ship them all down the other end of the game.

[02:51:56.480 --> 02:52:00.160]
Let them move and win if they can change.

[02:52:01.680 --> 02:52:01.880]
Yeah.

[02:52:05.260 --> 02:52:06.740]
Holy, open the door.

[02:52:07.280 --> 02:52:09.000]
He won't be the star.

[02:52:09.620 --> 02:52:12.560]
Well, they've all grown across the indiretors.

[02:52:12.840 --> 02:52:17.000]
You're the color that they will never good if you watch yours.

[02:52:17.720 --> 02:52:20.620]
At all the suns and all the fun.

[02:52:21.280 --> 02:52:24.320]
All they want to do is want to be clean and done.

[02:52:24.320 --> 02:52:28.500]
They're for the hot and they'll know stop it.

[02:52:30.060 --> 02:52:35.520]
They'll make us fit for the fair and clean.

[02:52:35.960 --> 02:52:39.780]
That's why they started putting on a string.

[02:52:40.040 --> 02:52:43.660]
Go ahead and give them all of these up.

[02:52:44.020 --> 02:52:46.980]
Let them move and win if can change.

[02:52:49.160 --> 02:52:49.420]
Yeah.

[02:52:53.680 --> 02:52:56.500]
All those very quite cold things that commit very serious crime.

[02:52:56.740 --> 02:52:57.500]
We get away with them now.

[02:52:58.080 --> 02:52:59.100]
Like OJ, for example.

[02:52:59.220 --> 02:53:00.240]
Here's a good example for you.

[02:53:00.620 --> 02:53:01.320]
Got some good news.

[02:53:01.840 --> 02:53:01.980]
Yeah.

[02:53:02.560 --> 02:53:09.280]
Common cause and non-profit government watchdog group filed a criminal complaint with the Department of Justice today against Representative Catherine Harris.

[02:53:09.920 --> 02:53:10.380]
All right.

[02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:16.960]
The groups complained that Harris was bribed by a defense contractor who's already plagued guilty, deriving former Representative Duke cutting him.

[02:53:16.960 --> 02:53:22.660]
It led to that Harris broke the law when the contractor paid 2800 bucks for fundraising dinner to Congresswoman Hill.

[02:53:23.280 --> 02:53:26.540]
And as you know, the Duke was recently since the years in prison.

[02:53:26.800 --> 02:53:29.380]
Not to mention those problems with the last past the 2000s.

[02:53:29.480 --> 02:53:30.780]
That's all right.

[02:53:30.780 --> 02:53:32.460]
And then he ran just goes with the territory.

[02:53:32.980 --> 02:53:34.540]
We got the gildy coming up next.

[02:53:34.680 --> 02:53:35.380]
That goes with the territory.

[02:53:35.380 --> 02:53:36.540]
And we got mad dog at Ford.

[02:53:36.680 --> 02:53:37.400]
The Marlon game.

[02:53:37.540 --> 02:53:37.720]
Come on.

[02:53:37.920 --> 02:53:39.360]
Get out there and support the Marlon's judge.

[02:53:39.420 --> 02:53:40.180]
You go over the game tonight.

[02:53:40.640 --> 02:53:40.780]
No.

[02:53:41.500 --> 02:53:41.900]
Why?

[02:53:42.280 --> 02:53:43.520]
I can watch from TV, man.

[02:53:43.860 --> 02:53:44.960]
Marlon's in the Phillies baby.

[02:53:45.060 --> 02:53:46.500]
You don't want to lose in a rich waltz.

[02:53:46.520 --> 02:53:49.560]
And by the way, whoever's running the board today at least please.

[02:53:49.820 --> 02:53:51.040]
Yeah, we got three drops, man.

[02:53:51.140 --> 02:53:51.660]
Wait for all of it.

[02:53:51.680 --> 02:53:52.180]
Well, whatever.

[02:53:52.340 --> 02:53:54.900]
And let us at least play the illegal ID or...

[02:53:54.900 --> 02:53:55.500]
I think you're ass.

[02:53:55.640 --> 02:53:56.400]
Bye, bye, bye.
