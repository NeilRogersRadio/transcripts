[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.400]
I have heard one mentioned about Kevin Adams.

[00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.700]
Yeah, where's he playing?

[00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.220]
Smok.

[00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.840]
Who was that?

[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:14.380]
What's that?

[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.560]
What was that about?

[00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.980]
Oh, that was an old thing from the worst team when they used to give a base on an answer

[00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.200]
to V.M. the spokesman in Viltory.

[00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.900]
And I would be standing in control and laughing my ass off.

[00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.960]
But nevertheless,

[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.380]
a team that doesn't make a playoff.

[00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.160]
So it's one of those things when a season starts just to resign yourself to the fact that they're not going to contend for the playoffs,

[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.960]
including this year.

[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.020]
So when you walk up their next season and hand them the five bucks when you walk up to the arena per person,

[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.160]
the 20 bucks for your family afford just for the honor of walking on the premises,

[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.980]
just remember they won't make the playoffs.

[00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:48.540]
Because they are not playoffs.

[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.480]
It's not in their vocabulary.

[00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.000]
It hasn't been for a while.

[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.020]
They've only made the playoffs once since they've been in new building.

[00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.160]
You do realize that, don't you?

[00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.320]
Yep.

[00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.240]
Once.

[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.220]
And only three times in history of the franchise.

[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.800]
Didn't have the Dolphins of Never Made a Super Bowl since they moved either.

[00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.400]
Yeah.

[00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.880]
Well, there are some franchises living in the distant past.

[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.600]
You know, the panties, the whole reason they exist is because of that one phantom season when they got high at the right time.

[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.380]
The Dolphins are living like 30 some years ago and they are same with Toronto Maple Leafs, man.

[00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.040]
Oh, brother.

[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.100]
They suck.

[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.820]
They're standing up in 1967.

[00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.480]
I was lucky as a kid.

[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.860]
They won a couple of four times in the 60s and that was the end of that.

[00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.180]
That's almost 40 years ago.

[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.320]
Franchise is living in the past.

[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.480]
That'd be a good pull someday.

[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.320]
By the way, Joe Bellis has no rush to fill that two to four.

[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.140]
See that in very scum.

[00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.460]
I think they're a jackass.

[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.360]
Yep.

[00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.140]
One thing about us, if we want to find out what's going on in the station,

[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.380]
what we got to do is wait till Friday and read Buries Calm.

[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.540]
Find out about Foxy Roxy who is working really hard as if anybody cares.

[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.460]
What kind of a name is that?

[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.100]
Roxy Bernstein besides Jewish.

[00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:59.860]
What kind of a name is that?

[00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.980]
Do an University of California basketball and racing back and forth?

[00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.500]
He's still squeaky.

[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.880]
But anyway, did you see that thing?

[00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:08.700]
Did you talk about that?

[00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.960]
We still know rush to fill the job vacated when Moe left in January.

[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.280]
And also, you see the most important part of that paragraph.

[00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.260]
Moe has been filling in his talk host on New York station 1050 AM.

[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.760]
I was not really in the mood to discuss Moe today.

[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.060]
No, I'm not talking about discussing him.

[00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.480]
I'm just talking about that two to four.

[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.400]
Oh, it is a fill in?

[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.580]
It's a fill in.

[00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.920]
Yeah.

[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.900]
1050.

[00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.600]
Well, a great frequency used to be WHA.

[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.540]
And long before that WMGM 1050.

[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.700]
What was that a great station or what?

[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.860]
It's the second sports station in New York now.

[00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.180]
With Peter Tripp, the curly head of Kid in the third row,

[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.660]
who almost went to jail, I'm thinking he did go to jail for Peola.

[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.240]
Saw the Alan Friede story over the weekend last weekend.

[00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.660]
Wow.

[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.200]
Called the movie.

[00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.960]
It was pretty interesting.

[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.940]
I saw that long time ago.

[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.260]
Make sure you're stuck into him, boy.

[00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.700]
Yep.

[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.620]
You want to be dying penniless somewhere in California.

[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.020]
So what happens to most of us in this business?

[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.560]
Why not go into the track kicking around those tickets on the ground?

[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.140]
Or the dep射o?

[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.500]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.200]
By the way, my streak is over.

[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.500]
All that wasn't really bad.

[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.360]
I lost 500 bucks.

[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.880]
It's nothing.

[00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.320]
I'm just going to be a big fan.

[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.020]
I'm going to be a big fan.

[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.700]
I'm going to be a big fan.

[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.700]

[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.100]
But you know what I'm saying?

[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.620]
That's a, that Alan Friede story.

[00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.440]
I mean, he was, if you think about how big that guy was in New York.

[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.020]
Yeah.

[00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.720]
Oh.

[00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.100]
I mean, everybody listened to that show.

[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.800]
And he hosted all those rock and roll shows.

[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.400]
Right.

[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.580]
That made sure to allow a show.

[00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.400]
And that movie, the last one of the Pulcups,

[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.140]
the way they did it, and they caused all this fewer.

[00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.740]
That thing was going along great.

[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.660]
The cops came in and created a riot.

[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:43.080]
Yep.

[00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.300]
And that was his last show.

[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.980]
And that was his last gig, too.

[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.040]
They didn't know anybody would hire him.

[00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.380]
And he went out to California and kicking around tickets at Santa.

[00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.260]
And either somewhere on the floor and on the ground.

[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.500]
He was a stupor, huh?

[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.600]
And he died penniless, poor Alan Friede.

[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.680]
That's what this business will do.

[00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.920]
You all do foolish people out there want to get into radio.

[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.620]
Don't do it.

[00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:01.720]
Don't even think about it.

[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.720]
Josh Cordis had a big night at the Bernie Kosois last night

[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.860]
and our fundraiser this year.

[00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:07.620]
And how much he raised?

[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.760]
How much?

[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.140]
Oh.

[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.420]
Oh.

[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.900]
Zero.

[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.540]
That's those keens people, man.

[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:16.000]
They're the worst.

[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.900]
They're the lowest form of slime on the face of the earth.

[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.220]
I think it's perfect that they brought in Donna Shaleighly to be there.

[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.620]
Right on St. Paddy's Day, who would want somebody named Donna Shaleighly?

[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:28.100]
Right?

[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.400]
To be the head of the university.

[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.040]
What a slimy place.

[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.700]
Oh, brother.

[00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.340]
You can't spell scumb without UM.

[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.840]
I realize it's old and trite, but I got to say it again.

[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:37.240]
It's true.

[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.760]
Slimy.

[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.220]
In fact, I take an extra shower every day just to wash off the sins from doing those six years

[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.820]
UM baseball.

[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.760]
Oh, brother.

[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.120]
And the alumni.

[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.800]
No, nobody knows students ever showed up today in those baseball games.

[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.140]
We'd have those big crowds, you know?

[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.740]
Thanks to Ron Fraser and his great promotional abilities.

[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.160]
See, that was all BS.

[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.340]
Ron never coached the team.

[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.500]
Skitburpman coached the team.

[00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.420]
That's why we hit good teams.

[00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.160]
And Ron was the PR guy, which he was very good at.

[00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.440]
So we used to have those huge overflow crowds, which they don't have that anymore.

[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.860]
Uh, baseball still draws pretty well.

[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.440]
Not like that.

[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.280]
Not like that, Mr. Henry.

[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.000]
Not like that.

[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.600]
Um.

[00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:15.480]
Those are the days.

[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.060]
I go down there about four or five times a year.

[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:20.460]
Do you?

[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.800]
Yeah.

[00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.100]
That's a good way to spend an afternoon.

[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.460]
Yeah.

[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.600]
And they got good food right now.

[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.640]
You sit here and smell smell like great sausage,

[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.260]
walking.

[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.780]
So I used to sit there last year next to Dave Lamont,

[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.820]
and he was farting so much that couldn't smell the sausage.

[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.660]
They've redone that stadium.

[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.000]
I haven't seen it since they did.

[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.380]
Really?

[00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.820]
Yeah.

[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.000]
How they got a special spot for J.

[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.940]
Roe Keaton is pickles.

[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.520]
J. Roe is still there.

[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.440]
Oh, brother.

[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.000]
How sad.

[00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.300]
He's going to die in that booth.

[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:45.860]
Him and Mike Resenthal.

[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.440]
They'll be dying in their respective booth.

[00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.760]
So J.

[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.680]
Roe was a basketball game Wednesday night.

[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.760]
When his life story is written, what did you do with your life?

[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.800]
Oh, I was the answer for the Miami Hurricanes baseball team.

[00:05:59.220 --> 00:05:59.820]
Basketball team.

[00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.860]
What was the real story with him in the Marlins?

[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.420]
Remember that?

[00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.200]
He was a P.A. guy the first couple of years ago.

[00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.280]
I remember why.

[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.720]
I think that was just like your deal.

[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.760]
I had something to do with the food.

[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.600]
He was making costs of comments about the food.

[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.220]
I think you were right.

[00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.720]
Yeah, I think that had something to do with it.

[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.920]
Yeah.

[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.860]
Don't knock the food there at the P.P. Park.

[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.660]
Meanwhile, you're putting this line to an University of Miami baseball.

[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.020]
Yeah, I enjoyed it.

[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.820]
Like I said, the students didn't show up.

[00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.360]
It was the people in the community came out and supported it.

[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.500]
Very few students.

[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.560]
Because it's a fanned to me University.

[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:30.360]
There are no students.

[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.200]
There's no campus.

[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.200]
There's no dorms.

[00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:33.280]
There's no classes.

[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:33.800]
I don't think.

[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]
Especially for the athletes.

[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.020]
Just sports teams.

[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.060]
Well, your buddy Joe's got to have something to do, you know?

[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.460]
Yeah.

[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.260]
So what's going on with you this weekend?

[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.280]
Well, what do you think?

[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:49.340]
I guess.

[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.800]
I got a lot of money burning a hole in my pocket.

[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.740]
I couldn't.

[00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:55.500]
I went to yesterday.

[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.100]
I walked in there.

[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:56.800]
I got a good machine.

[00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.180]
It was the one that was open and it gave me a within 200 bucks on the line.

[00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:00.700]
And I played.

[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.640]
I put in a hundred dollar bill and I played in that 100 for two and a half hours.

[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:05.760]
Now that's, that's good machine.

[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.220]
Never give anything big.

[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.960]
But you know, 200 and other 200.

[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.520]
And just just kept going and going like the Energizer Bunny.

[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.940]
It was pretty, it was pretty entertaining.

[00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.420]
So I lost a little bit and went home.

[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.560]
Because I had to try my sure talking noodles.

[00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:19.500]
Oh, how were they?

[00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.920]
You know, you don't.

[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.060]
Oh, never mind.

[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.740]
No, they're not that bad.

[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:24.600]
It's just that they're not.

[00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.180]
I know most people wouldn't like them.

[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:26.440]
Okay.

[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.200]
First of all, you open the little bag.

[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.140]
You drain the water out.

[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.660]
It smells like fish, which I hate fish.

[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.120]
And you drain them off.

[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.380]
Once you wash them off, they're okay.

[00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.700]
And then you like a newcomp for a couple of minutes and you pour your sauce and sausage or whatever.

[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:38.620]
Me falls over it.

[00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.340]
And it's, but they're very chewy.

[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:41.300]
You know, they're okay.

[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.860]
They don't have any taste or any smell, but they're a little on the chewy side.

[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:45.580]
They're all right.

[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.100]
But I got some dream fields pasta coming eventually here next couple of days,

[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.960]
which supposedly is like regular pasta, but it's very low carb, almost no carbs.

[00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.400]
I mean, it's, you make it sound like you're eating flavorless gummy bears.

[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.020]
No, it's a little, it's kind of like that.

[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.060]
That's a pretty good comparison.

[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.280]
That's what it's out of like.

[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:03.540]
Chewy.

[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:04.860]
No, you wouldn't like it.

[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:05.180]
No.

[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.700]
I think it's for goyem.

[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.540]
Well, or maybe just for the Arabs, I don't know, for the Arab street.

[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.860]
Maybe the Arab street would like it.

[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:21.360]
Yeah, I'm telling you this 30th anniversary thing, this fundraiser that they talked me into.

[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:22.320]
I didn't want any part of it.

[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.780]
I knew that, you know, enough is enough.

[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.560]
Let's not go there anymore.

[00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:26.880]
And it's just a disaster.

[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:28.220]
It's just a disaster.

[00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:31.620]
I can't even break 20 grand.

[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.140]
I just, I'm embarrassed by it because I don't want anything to do with it.

[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.620]
Just like Tom Jickey, you know, he shine.

[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.100]
And by the way, your buddy Tom, next time you see him at the track,

[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.940]
just before he threw him over the edge of the roof,

[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.760]
he screwed up on Greg Budell to get that information wrong in his column too.

[00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.460]
See, anything that has to do with local is out of his territory now.

[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:54.620]
Unless it's a pre-fat column about some TV show that's going off the earth in five minutes, he has, is coolest.

[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.180]
What did he have to touch?

[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.640]
What did he write about Greg Budell?

[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.540]
In the Q&A thing, last Sunday, somebody asked him,

[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:01.620]
whatever happened to Greg Budell.

[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.880]
So he writes that, oh, he's holding his talk show skills.

[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.260]
He's doing a talk show in Alabama.

[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:10.680]
And he's counting on when Neo-Rajor's retires, he's going to take his spot.

[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.220]
And he was only half kidding when he said it.

[00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.120]
Well, I must have talked to Budell like months ago,

[00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.140]
because then I get on Monday, I read that,

[00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.780]
and I get a couple of emails that he's doing talk show on,

[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:23.900]
I know he's playing oldies music on 640, on WDJNA, in Palm Beach.

[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.740]
So once again, little Tommy has no clue what's going on in South Florida.

[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.100]
I'm 1200 miles away to Sonny Shiningay,

[00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:34.040]
and I got a much better finger on the pulse of South Florida than Tom Jickey.

[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:34.840]
He's so out of touch.

[00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:38.860]
Okay.

[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.280]
No, you don't have to say anything.

[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.040]
I know these are all your buddies, I'm always picking up.

[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.500]
You have to say, and I want to, you know,

[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.540]
put a crimp into your friendship just like Dick Stockton.

[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:47.580]
At least he had a sense of humor.

[00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:48.680]
That was great that day.

[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:49.700]
That was very funny.

[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.180]
That was very funny.

[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.000]
I bet you Jim Lampley don't have a sense of humor

[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.260]
if you said something about his wife.

[00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.000]
I remember Jim Lampley, when he was at ABC,

[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.200]
had that little pot problem when he was at ABC.

[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:04.220]
Yeah.

[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:04.960]
Yeah.

[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.840]
That was about 30 years ago.

[00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.780]
And his wife gets really bad out of shape when he tells her to roll him a joint.

[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:10.760]
She gets very upset.

[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:13.440]
I don't know.

[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.920]
His wife doesn't have any hands.

[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:16.260]
I know.

[00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.060]
She has this condition.

[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.240]
She has hands, but they're...

[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:21.800]
You don't want it.

[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.740]
You really want to explore this any further?

[00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:23.940]

[00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:24.180]
You sure?

[00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:26.620]
I was hoping.

[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.080]
I was hoping you weren't going to go there.

[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:29.360]
No.

[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:30.640]
Her finger is a huge ladder.

[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.520]
We'd rather go back to 1050 and Mo.

[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.460]
Well, that's the guy that he's got to have something going on, huh?

[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:35.680]
Mo.

[00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:36.560]
Something Mo and on.

[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.880]
They allow mom when it's a rating period?

[00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:44.360]
Hey, listen, don't start now.

[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.300]
He's legendary in his own mind.

[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:47.420]
Make no mistake about it.

[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.580]
Plus, he's got that New Yorkie Jewish sound.

[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.340]
They like him up there until they realize who it is.

[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:53.960]
Oh, that's Mo, how are you David?

[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.500]
Oh, boy, we shouldn't want to hear him.

[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.060]
Go to the dial, see more.

[00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.180]
They're not going to be too happy about that.

[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:01.480]
Well, listen, have a great weekend.

[00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:02.700]
Yeah, you took your plenty.

[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:03.980]
You've got all your college hoops.

[00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.100]
You've got the Panther Islander game in the background tonight.

[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.380]
It's a big weekend.

[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.720]
Any K of you giving you the over's numbers on the Panther Islander game looks at its

[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.820]
Over at 10 o'clock, he'll be on from Atlantic City.

[00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.260]
Boy, you guys who got the life.

[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.400]
Oh, yeah, he's the only one who's going to be able to see the show from Atlantic City.

[00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:18.220]
Yeah, he's the only one.

[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.680]
I tell you one thing, I wouldn't go back to Atlantic City if they gave me 10th.

[00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.080]
10 grand in case the gamble.

[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.520]
If I had a pen it there, I wouldn't go there.

[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.760]
I don't think he was all excited about going there.

[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.000]
Now, some fight that he's doing.

[00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:28.840]
Oh, is that it?

[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:29.040]
Yeah.

[00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:31.460]
Definitely not a place for Jews.

[00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:32.140]
I'll tell you that.

[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:32.940]
Atlantic City?

[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:33.880]
No way.

[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.720]
The next town.

[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.340]
Next town.

[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:39.360]

[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:39.740]
Next town.

[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.320]
It's a next town.

[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:44.320]

[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:44.320]

[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:44.320]

[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:44.320]

[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:44.940]
Next town.

[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:44.940]

[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:50.700]
By the way, I got, there's an ad today that's pretty horrifying on page 68 of the entertainment

[00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:52.680]
section of the Sun Sentinel before you go.

[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:53.240]
Yeah.

[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.620]
Boca's new smash hit supper club.

[00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.500]
Five guys named Mo.

[00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.720]
Oh, wow.

[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:00.540]
Now play.

[00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:01.340]
I'm going to play with the Dr. Dory.

[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.640]
You know, I'm going to play with the Dr. Dory.

[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:04.400]
You know, I'm going to play with the Dr. Dory.

[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.120]
You know, I'm going to play with the Dr. Dory.

[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.080]
You know, I'm going to play with the Dr. Dory.

You know, I'm going to play with the Dr. Dory.

You know, I'm going to play with the Dr. Dory.

You know, I'm going to play with the Dr. Dory.

You know, I'm going to play with the Dr. Dory.

You know, I'm going to play with the Dr. Dory.

[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:30.520]
You know, I'm going to play with the Dr. Dory.

[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.000]
Don't be afraid.

[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.320]
Step right up there and send it in.

[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:32.800]
I'm ready.

[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:33.880]

Welcome to the ae wish as long as never been except

[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:22.800]
Perhaps the last of the cards we've never been sure of that you can be seen in drunken herl and terms will laugh it all away

[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.480]
But you can't be a you should go gay

Drunks

[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:42.500]
I'm just just talking about Irish either. I mean just this is right excuse for people to get drunk

[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.400]
Saint Patty that's right

[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:48.800]
742 votes on today's pool before we get anything else don't worry about the sure talking noodles

[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:53.020]
Okay, some of you will like them and some of you say oh fat. I'm here that echo again

[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:55.260]
And I'm getting pretty tired. How about now?

[00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:00.280]
Yeah, is that gone? Yeah, it's gone now. Why don't we keep doing that all week? Is this our first week on the air or what?

[00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:05.980]
Just maybe our last week, huh? Just the mess with you. I think not seriously. It's getting really annoying you just

[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:11.200]
Cut the crap. What was that? I just kept your return on there. Well cut it out

[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:15.620]
And look at that we're doing this demographic pool which we already are if we had any audience

[00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:20.660]
We already had about three four thousand votes on her because I realized it's only a snapshot of the whole audience, you know about half

[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:27.500]
But Christ almighty what's the story with these people that you are so lethargic

[00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:31.900]
Just never saw a place that was like so dead and look at that

[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:36.440]
We got no the only category left that we have nobody on there yet in our demographic survey

[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.320]
Which we we haven't done this in about three years

[00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:44.960]
Hispanic white female 55 plus we got no old Juliet and old green tutulietta come on

[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:52.460]
No, they're watching the show from Alita come on Celia Cruz. I went no none zero. They're all with Arario Mambe and Arario

[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:57.340]
C.M.I. Cool and all this other crap yet with it speaking in glazing give it a program. We can place

[00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.820]
So our total for abandoned pet rescue with our

[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.800]
Pain with our CDs and T-shirts. I I looked out to you CD here

[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.540]
I'm gonna read some of the privacy on there to try to like goose up a little business. I

[00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:13.060]
18,000 to seventy five now. That's

[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:19.240]
Well, when did we officially start this two and a half weeks ago?

[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:24.560]
Did we start it on the I don't know on your anniversary on the March 1st? Right, so today's is 17

[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.920]
So that means like two and a half weeks this thing's been going on

[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:31.660]
Mm-hmm, and we got less than 20 grand and that's not very really uplifting to me

[00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:33.460]
Okay, we're disconcerting

[00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:36.500]
Almost as this concerning the fact that it's already 1014

[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:42.000]
This is a time a year

[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.080]
Would everyone's a wee bit higher this say Colleen would you be wanting to come over to my place to help me?

[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:49.340]
It waxed my shell

[00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.480]
Now that I would my departure

[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.800]
If you be wet in the green

[00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:57.660]
Oh, there's a smart lassie

[00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:03.960]
She's making sure her lad is wearing the Kelly green protection of left for a condom

[00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:06.200]
Don't be with an alcoholic

[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.700]
Clover I'll fall in for the gift of gab

[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.260]
Especially if you're planning on kissing some blind stones

[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:18.220]
What have you be doublet in your protection with different condoms?

[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:21.820]
They're strong enough for a man, but I like them too

[00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:27.080]
So take yourself a different condom and your work be kitchen anything else

[00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:28.720]
Happy shame Patty's day

[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:33.580]
That's asked to hop her about the green bagels. I guess we don't get those at QAM right that was at IOD

[00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:36.080]
We haven't ever here now

[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:40.540]
Now cuz I already know at least I would do you had a couple of Jews working there now

[00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:44.340]
I do only Jews we got a mistake now the ones on the air 10.19 a QAM

[00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:48.900]
Here's the fact that says thank you so much for posting link to 9.11 loose change addition to

[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.380]
Everybody must watch that if you got an IQ larger than your thumbnail

[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.780]
Larger than a hang nail

[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:59.900]
Since I'd love to rent a theater have a showing for locals who knows maybe I can find the books to do so that would be great

[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.760]
All the way out I have it like on TV everybody ought to be

[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:09.080]
Courses sit down watch fair night and I love it and then loose change part two and a Pentagon strike and all of these all of these

[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:14.960]
Things but they won't and they don't because they're busy. So anyway those noodles

[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:20.760]
Yeah, I don't know I tried to convince myself that they were good. They weren't bad

[00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:26.540]
They were edible and I put my sauce on there my low-carves sauce and the good news is my blood sugar actually went down

[00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:30.900]
Half hour after I did then what kind of like back up to where it started which is okay and

[00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:37.340]
And it didn't seem to have like any impact on my blood sugar because they're virtually zero carbs. No, that part of it's good

[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:44.040]
My suggestion is wash it off real good and nuke it for three or four minutes and then for your stuff over it

[00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:46.340]
And don't you don't even use the whole bag

[00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:51.800]
I use a half a bag in other words as kind of like a filler to your sauce and your sausages and maybe some

[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:56.380]
Mushroom yeah, then some fillers all of the sliced black olives of it stuff like that and

[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.340]
Then I'm gonna try to day like melting some cheese on it

[00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:05.120]
Yeah, I always big on melting cheese and pasta. I love that

[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:09.540]
Like I told you I could even take a can of Frank who American spaghetti, which is real garbage

[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.000]
It's no this is me

[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:16.280]
You're in a right mood and you like take a slice of swiss cheese and you jam it in here and you nuke it in all melt

[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.600]
Oh, if you're the right mood like starving and you're gonna die

[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.440]
You're gonna die. That's really depressed

[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.720]
If Gildi was on here that day. Oh, he's on here today. Oh geez

[00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.280]
Yeah, let's look at that schedule

[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:32.000]
We got Gildi at the end of center with two o'clock this afternoon. I cost you a hundred bucks to walk up and say hi to him

[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:38.340]
Mad dog at conines for the 630 by the way, I want you to be sure and get over there and buy a bunch of stuff because

[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:42.600]
Josh Cordis will be there and if he doesn't raise more than oh, I'm canceling all food to checks

[00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:48.900]
Even if he has to put up 20 bucks himself pants are peve with 630 panthers host the islanders 7 or 5 tonight

[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:55.640]
Well, I said big game for the islanders anyway and any came from a landing city follows panthers hockey any interest no in those panthers no

[00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:02.700]
So you're gonna be out of cone on some shooting you better needed down there at Bernie steak on cozard

[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:06.180]
I'm sure of it and one guy did show up, but he forgot his cash. Yeah

[00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:11.480]
What do you want to do? Come back buddy? He said he was coming back. Yeah, I always say that mm-hmm

[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:16.960]
So is a general MacArthur he's coming back. I shall return or you're not done get lost

[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:21.760]
Before anything else waits in here this it shows you the Democrats how they just misread everything

[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.920]
They're just just a bunch of spineless cowards. They don't even know what's going on

[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.180]
And also your guy new hero Lou dobs idiot

[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:30.080]
Yeah, what is this man thinking as he lost his mind?

[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:36.760]
Rust find roll well guess what a new poll finds that a plurality of Americans favor plans to censure George W

[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:41.420]
Bush while surprising 42% favor most actually impeach your president

[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.660]
How do you like that? I like it a lot a poll taken March 15th

[00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.980]
That sounds like two days ago by American research group found that among all adults

[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:58.060]
46% favor rust find goals played a censure out presently while just 44% opposed a proof of the plan grows slightly when the sample is narrowed

[00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:03.500]
of voters up to 48% in favor of censuring the sitting president even more shocking

[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:10.360]
Oh my god, is that just 57% of Republicans are opposed to the move 14% still on the side of 29% actually in favor

[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:15.000]
fully 70% of Democrats want to see Bush censured most surprising of all

[00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:22.100]
The poll found fully 43% of voters in favor of actually impeaching the president would just 50% of voters imposed

[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:29.020]
While only 18% of Republicans want to see Bush impeached 61% of Democrats and 47% of independence reported

[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:32.000]
They wanted to see the house move ahead with the Kanye's resolution

[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:39.100]
The poll was taken March 13 to 15 Monday through a Wednesday. I like that right during Purim no less

[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:40.800]
Probably a Jew thing

[00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:42.660]
So there you go

[00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:50.040]
Okay, here's our poll from yesterday. What simply doesn't mix not a bad poll. Thanks Sean come up with something good for a change

[00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:52.060]
1625 votes

[00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:59.520]
Fundraisers in the show should have been on that would have been number one I devoted for it 4,000 times not doing that no more

[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.140]
It's getting me very aggravated

[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:07.280]
Just creeping along of course you're forgetting about a lot of the stuff like it IOD Camilla South said their own mailing list

[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:12.120]
Remember that that's right, and so we get I get all every day we get like a whole physical a check

[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:15.740]
You know a couple thousand right 100 plus the money was coming in from the

[00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:17.800]
Appearances and stuff right

[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:22.220]
First of all, of course, I was being donated internally by everybody and I'm not doing that

[00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:27.080]
I don't want to like put any muscle on anybody because it's just it's just not right. I didn't want to do this in the first place

[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:29.780]
I don't want it. Okay, I don't want it

[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.160]
Leave me alone

[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:37.680]
What simply doesn't mix church in state 501 George Bush in the White House 320 Jews and Arabs

[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:51.080]
123 sex and potty 123 money and friendship 55 of it's a bad mix

[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:55.580]
Just keep your money in your pocket said like to remain your friend. I'm not giving you a dime

[00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:59.760]
Even if you're gonna starve it a rather be your friend and watch you eat

[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:04.480]
South Florida and hockey 35 of bad mix just stupid business and families got

[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:11.980]
Guns and bull is 25 dolphins and the Super Bowl 17 sex and food 16 love and marriage 15

[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.460]

Cubans and Democrats 10 high school and military recruiter six panthers into playoffs for and old parts and movie theaters too

[00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:32.340]

[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:33.340]
Oh, yeah repeating the dial

Yeah, or whatever

[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:48.020]
Ben Burry Jackass writes this is just amazing. I just I don't get it. Do you get it?

[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:51.300]
Get what the way they're just dragging their heels on this thing?

[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:55.040]
I don't have any schedule for the white clearance. No, I don't either might be up on the board

[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:59.300]
But I don't have we don't got no schedule. Well, maybe they're still deciding about that too

[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:04.440]
QM general manager Joe Bell said there's no rush to fill the job vacated with how it's divided

[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:06.700]
They

[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:10.580]
Left in January after being informed this contract would not be renewed. It's still wide open

[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:13.720]
He said well, isn't that great? It's only March 17th, Wednesday and Paddy's day

[00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:18.660]

External options those are various words external

[00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:42.800]
Meanwhile Mojave David's been filling in the Zotalk coast on New York station 1050 and that's not the fan

[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:47.240]
That's the secondary sports talk station in New York. Of course goes on saying well

[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.260]
There you go, Mo best

So used to having it there you miss it badly

[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.080]
Okay, well, we get to that demographic survey how are we gonna do that?

[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:49.140]
Organizer's barred Irish gays and lesbians from joining the festivities for a 16th straight year. How do you like that? Yeah, just like that bit we play

[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:56.800]
Anybody can be Irish unless of course you're gay. I can't deny who I am in any given days. If council speaker Christine Quinn

[00:36:57.580 --> 00:37:01.260]
The mighty Quinn wonder if she's kind of Pat Quinn. He's gonna get canned

But will not join 150,000 marchers today on Fifth Avenue

[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:16.040]

[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:25.440]
45th parade fell through the city's Irish gays had long hoped to march behind their own banner like other groups

[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:29.800]
Now, the words you think I can't read now is that what you're trying to tell me I know the hybranians way back way

[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:32.740]
Your visions go blurry from all my vision is fine. I can see it

[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:36.080]
I see it real clear, you know when it shows up. I see it

[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:44.940]
The fight to let Irish gays march out of their own banner dates to 1991 for when parade organizers first rejected the application from the Irish lesbian and gay organization

[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:51.520]
I didn't even know there wasn't Irish lesbian and gay organization. There is no the organizers said they wanted to keep politics out of the event

[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:53.440]
Which attracts as many as too many inspectators

[00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:56.400]
Well, this is Irish they always like their taters

[00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:01.580]
Instead 35 members marched with the Manhattan division of the hybranians and then mayor David Dinkins

[00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:07.180]
The group was sprayed with beer and insults as it walked up Fifth Avenue. That was its last appearance in the parade

[00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:09.060]
Yeah, the Irish hate it when you spray that with beer

[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:17.280]
Mayor Michael Bloomberg who marched today again urge the hybranians to change their stance and leave the gay contingent in

[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:20.680]
I've always believed this is a city where all perage should be open to everybody orientation

[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:25.940]
In general should not be deciding thing said Bloomberg. He also said oh like that just like that

[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:30.600]
He leaves me limp man. He's got he can't complain about his personality because he doesn't have any

[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.500]
He's his boring is old

[00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:33.800]
spilt milk

[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:42.100]
The arena for the first round NCAA men's tournament game between Alabama and Marquette was temporarily evacuated yesterday after bomb-stiffing dogs

[00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:45.420]
Tought a suspicious package about two hours before tip-off

[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:54.560]
The dogs detected the package inside a four by inch condom and container in a vendor cart outside Cox arena at San Diego State University

[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:58.660]
A bomb robot was sent to the scene FBI spokeswoman Jan Calwell said

[00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:03.460]
CBS news learned that the all-clearity arena took place less than two hours before tip-off

[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:10.380]
Fans began filing in 40 minutes before the rescheduled tip-off Marquette players were the first to take the floor who cares about that

[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.020]
No bomb was found well, I guess what it was actually true not to be like a bad weenie

[00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:16.600]
Is what it was

[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:22.120]
Did we see dogs sniffing a bad weenie? I'll talk now. I know just this one

[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:25.600]
That's what it was so there was a bad weenie in the vending cart in the dogs sniff that I was just probably good

[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:28.340]
Probably say it somebody food poisoning. There was no bomb no terrorist

[00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:31.020]
So I'm not going to panic or anything like that you understand

[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:39.180]
I'm still not getting no return email from my friends at what is it dream works dream fields dream my dream on dream on Randy

[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:45.240]
Then that bug you when you email somebody just wait and wait and wait and then when you least expect it

[00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:49.560]
You get a response or not. We're okay. I'm gonna have to call them at two o'clock. Just bitch them out

[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:55.840]
I might do it doing during the next break call up and say where's my damn pasta damn it and now that the guy called and said it's really good stuff

[00:39:56.820 --> 00:40:02.160]
Maybe I'm going to fight it in my supermarket instead of wasting my time although I have bought three things this week online

[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.520]

Not a little funny dirty like some people all I don't know nothing about computers. That's it. That's just based my bloodboard

[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:23.660]
I don't get it. Why not? Why not come into the 21st century here my change come into the 20th century

[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:25.900]

[00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:38.140]

[00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:32.520]
That's good. I like that. Sure they're obvious. It's spontaneous. The stream of unconsciousness

What's his name Larry King in the track? Did you know that he used to be on the show called Race to Riches?

[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:05.400]

If you worry you'd be in the pub all the time

[00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:10.480]
Just wonder off the ladder

[00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:13.860]
But first what you see is some kindness that my mother plays

[00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:17.320]

But like we said the other day we don't care. You know, we're just the here to do the rest we can under impossible circumstances

[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.620]
Now I got this whole I got a stack of pretty good stuff here

[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:53.280]
God

[00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:56.420]
Gay versus Muslim soccer said in Netherlands

[00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:58.200]
I've heard about that this morning

[00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:02.440]
A Dutch multi-culture group is organizing a soccer tournament between gays and Muslims

[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:07.620]
Hoping to counter what a study published yesterday who said was a rising tide of fear among gays

[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:10.680]
A nationwide survey by the police research academy in

[00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:16.860]
Netherlands said that most gays question feel unsafe and report to experience verbal attacks in the last year

[00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:17.440]
You fairy

[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:24.640]
Of the 776 home also responded to an internet questionnaire 80% said they believe their safety was threatened at some time during the year said

[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.360]
Academy director Fritz V

[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:27.700]
Black V Black

[00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:35.580]
Who commissioned the research only 2% said they were physically assaulted black said in interview but some 40% claim they've been sold or verbally abused you

[00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:39.940]
Fairy youths from a rocket and Turkish backgrounds often were blamed for the instance while I figures

[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:45.560]
The cause homosexuality is not widely accepted many Muslim cultures. Well, thank God. It says no Muslim homos

[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:52.320]
Parts of the Muslim community still resist homosexuality. We see a little education about it. He said

[00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:58.120]
Muslim gays tension is the theme of the soccer tournament organized by the institute of multicultural development

[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:05.080]
And always are an organizer with a group says you hope the competition will help ease those tensions so that people can openly talk about homosexuality

[00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:08.840]
Game Muslims can take their choice of teams. She said people have many identities

How am I about to give the time delay? What does that mean? No, when you say it's 10 minutes after 11

[00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:03.640]
Yeah, and you're on a 15 second delay. We have a special clock

[00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:34.220]
But

We both want to see these we both love it

[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:43.920]
He's in mind we've got the best of TVs all the way back from 92

[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:46.740]

You know because he's got a good sense of humor in spite of all of his uh for veils

[00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:02.600]
He's got to have but I that would have been that would have been bad when it keep your chin's up

[00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:06.900]
Yeah, what it is first. I don't know how much weight he's lost since he said all these uh. Oh hope a lot

[00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:22.840]
That sure tacky place. I guarantee you I guarantee you wouldn't need it

[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:26.820]
Just what you say. I mean, I'm just telling you wouldn't eat it

[00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:33.000]
All right, you eat that cup of noodles crap. That's a that's my little math. Okay. Oh, this is far superior to that

[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.940]
Especially if you do like that guy said before maybe like you know boil it a little bit with an egg

[00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:40.460]
Maybe put a little butter in there a little garlic and butter hmm

[00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:46.140]
But they're chewy. It's not it's not what you're expecting when you bite into a noodle, you know what I mean

[00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:50.280]
Sometimes you put thing in your something in your mouth you're expected to have a certain texture and consistency

[00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:55.500]
And then it does not you know, what's that you know like that? Let's write sure you've had that experience. No

[00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:25.420]
Yeah, but they're extremely hesitant to rip W

[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:29.860]
And what really was the icing on the cake while I really don't look them anymore is

[00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:34.560]
Now we don't know if you you you call me with this a couple weeks ago with the same song at a dance about Bob and Tom

[00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:53.400]
5 6 7 0 5 6 in the other word nothing worse than somebody's got funny bits and doesn't do them themselves

[00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:57.700]

[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:28.180]
Okay let me come back. Maybe the egg will come out of his shell.

[01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:36.520]
Thanks a lot for requesting it pal. Because it's long. It's been a long time. That's the one

[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:41.380]
redeeming the sky going. The only redeeming thing. Dispise it.

[01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:45.460]
And we got well over a thousand people checked in, a thousand twenty two on a demographic survey.

[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:47.620]
And we still got old holy eggs. Oh. Oh.

[01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:51.560]
None. Old holy eggs. I don't know. My mom, me, communist, I come, my niece, my decoy,

[01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:57.120]
I made better movement like that. Well tell with them. I'm going to get into my pile now.

[01:01:57.140 --> 01:01:59.540]
Okay we're taking a lot of great calls. How are we doing over there at the public?

[01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:00.780]
60 bucks so far.

[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.580]
You know I'm going to tell you something. I think Duff needs a spanking although he might like it.

[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:12.340]
You're fairing. I am so aggravated with that child. You know he wouldn't see and you want to know why?

[01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:16.660]
Why? Because this isn't a positive. It's a negative. It's a downer. You know what I mean?

[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.620]
Coming at a time when you're at 30th anniversary you think oh this is going to be really great.

[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:26.140]
Exciting. Da da da da da da. You're positive. No that's a negative. It's a downer.

[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:28.440]
It brings you. Don't bring me down. Let's play that all day.

[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:34.500]
By the animals. Don't bring me down. Eric Burden and the animal. What a burden he's placed on us.

[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:38.360]
You know how come he's that out there running around collecting money. I don't see him doing nothing.

[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:43.300]
Mr. Genius, Mr. Hot Shot, Mr. Sticken, his nose and where don't belong. Duff. Now what are they stuck

[01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:48.320]
his ass in sales? Wouldn't be the worst place it's been from what I'm hearing.

[01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:55.560]
No old Juliette's 40 what do you say 60 bucks? Yeah and he's been there since the 10 before.

[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:59.160]
So let me say it again. This is the last time I'm not going to sit here in vague all day.

[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:02.780]
Just why should I do that? The sunny shining. It's a little on the chilly side. It's about

[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:10.280]
about 30 minutes. But it's pleasant. It's fine. No snow. What are his gone? It's come and gone.

[01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:15.680]
Wasn't much here. Spring is sprung. In fact, what the hell is spring official is like the 21st, right?

[01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:23.900]
He's living today. We're looking. The 20th. The 20th. Yeah. So like midnight on Sunday is the spring already.

[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:29.220]
We're going to be springing into it. So that part of it is all good, but this other stuff. If you want

[01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:34.980]
to help us out with this best. If you want to get your, because it might be worth something

[01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:39.500]
someday, I'm sure it won't, but I'm just lying. I'm just telling you that. I went through and read

[01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:42.740]
all the titles off of there, all the neat stuff like young Neil that I just played that son of

[01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:45.840]
here. You can listen to it until you're blue in the face, till you're sick, till you want to puke

[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:50.040]
your guts out, till you wanted your show 400 pounds of sugar-talky noodles down your fat gullet.

[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:55.680]
Okay. We're not. We can just like put it up on a wall. We still have the plastic on it,

[01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:59.640]
like a, like our collector's item, you know? Like we do with stamps. Remember when you

[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:04.240]
stamp collecting and putting them little cellophane things? No, I never did that. Get out of here.

[01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:09.500]
You never wore a stamp collector? Sorry. That's four rich kids. No. No, and it's not for a rich

[01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:13.880]
kid. Oh, when I was a kid, you'd send away like two dollars and get like 600 stamps. You have

[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:17.180]
thousand. You had two dollars when you were a stay-oh, I had to pitch your Hitler on them, but

[01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:23.100]
never less. Uh-huh. So here's the deal. The QM van is at the public's parking lot and Hollywood

[01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:26.340]
Young Circle from now on, one o'clock today. Rolly is there. You don't have to be intimidated.

[01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:31.040]
Miguel's not there. You don't have to tell him how shapely his ass is or what good shape he's in,

[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:35.300]
and nothing like that. Because I don't know who the hell Rolly is, but I guess he's, he's just a guy,

[01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:39.240]
okay? He's not looking for compliments. You don't have to slap money ass like that lady got slapped

[01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:44.580]
in the bank. Just go there and toss him cash his way. You got to teach your kids. If you want to

[01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:49.400]
slap money, I should probably enjoy it. You know, yeah, a little slap. See how it works out.

[01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:54.940]
Might go somewhere from there. And that's it. I'm doing my part and that's all I can do.

[01:04:55.800 --> 01:05:00.080]
Because these things have been as much of a dud, as much of a clunker this year, and I knew they

[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:04.580]
would. I mean, just first of all, I hate to say this, but a lot of these vits around the CD, they're

[01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:10.240]
right there on other ones. Right. You know, a year after year, we've, no, listen to me. We've

[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:15.120]
kind of like Dwayne's stop in the bridge tender when young and old and that's fine. And a lot of

[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:19.140]
people don't want to spend 20 bucks for a lot of stuff that they've already got. Dwayne's stop has

[01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:24.780]
never been on any others. You wrong. Absolutely. Rolly. Rolly, how much do you want to bet? I don't

[01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:29.800]
know. 20 bucks. I'll bet you next four years pay against the dime. How's that? All right. I'm

[01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:35.700]
telling you right now it was. It was only one, maybe the first one. I got it. All right.

[01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:40.400]
Not the long version. That's never been on one. That's not the original one.

[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:47.260]
All right. That's the original long version. Remember, we got rid of the cart.

[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:52.600]
And if any version has ever been on a cart, it was the short version, which doesn't even make sense

[01:05:52.600 --> 01:06:05.220]
on a CD that is. If it's on anyone, it'll be now you want. No. Wrong. All right. Wrong.

[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:11.180]
But it's called short version. They label is what it's called. Uh-huh. Okay. I don't know what

[01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:15.860]
it's longer. The short it is on here though. This is the very first one we had on CD. Remember the

[01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:19.260]
burden I used to put him on cassettes and he would like to write a double cassettes, copies him,

[01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:26.000]
and Pat Wisch was having copies too. It's a minute neat. How long do I want to miss your CD?

[01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:32.020]
I don't know. Opposer to three. Imagine. Yeah, this is the short version.

[01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:36.120]
When you guys destroyed the cart, you destroyed the original long version.

[01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:40.460]
Wow. Who cares? Like I said, there's a lot of stuff on here. I mean, you know, you're always looking

[01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:45.120]
at a mid-pick. I mean, other than that's a good idea. It's a good point. That's an

[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:49.080]
30 sales point. That's a very good point. You'll never find this anywhere in the year.

[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:52.000]
That's right. You auctioned all the cart on our bow 30.

[01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:58.460]
bow 30. There's another reason that you don't want it. You'll see. We'll raise about the 300 today.

[01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:02.160]
Like I said, you know something. We ought to just stop.

[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:06.900]
Would it just leave it on the website? I just don't have the,

[01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:12.580]
the, you know, enthusiasm. What? We can do that. No, I just don't have the enthusiasm to

[01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:16.880]
continue with this. It's a forest. It's a shadow of what it used to be. First of all, we're on

[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:20.340]
the wrong radio station. That's number one. Secondly, look at this demographic survey and

[01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:24.020]
improve beyond. Look, Joe Bell. I hate to break the news here because he came over to us from

[01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:29.520]
KISS, which is on FM country KISS, where they're kissing it. The fact that a matter is that

[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:33.860]
most living and breathing people, that's why we have no women. Okay. Women don't listen to

[01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:38.600]
AM radio. No, but frankly, most people under the age of 100 don't listen to AM radio anymore.

[01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:43.000]
Either AM radio is when I would high button shoes, when I would white box. AM radio is

[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:47.460]
better than a door nail. It's better than her Hebert Hebert. Okay. But we got the 8D now.

[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:50.500]
Like I said, how many HD sets are there in the world?

[01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:58.560]
How is my case? HD, my ass. By the way, when's that Toshiba HD thing coming out? The DVD, HD.

[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:03.040]
Yeah, where are we going to sound? We're going to sound great at HD.

[01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:07.260]
God, it's going to be fantastic. Can you imagine, especially with our technical or

[01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:09.440]
capabilities we got here with this engineering staff?

[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:16.460]
Our annual demographic survey, which are you? We've got 1,040 people to check. There's not one

[01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:22.080]
old Hispanic-wide female. Zero. That is shocking. Does that tell you a lot about South Florida?

[01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:26.420]
I think we ought to put an asterisk next to all of our records because it's

[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:30.160]
much more impressive. By the way, John, we took a survey of the seed

[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:33.880]
many hold with the upside if we decided not to do anything more for the CD, but they just

[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:36.420]
leave it on the website. I guess how many people would be upset with that?

[01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:44.380]
Oh, right. Well, you take the survey inside our studios or outside? Both. I see.

[01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:48.680]
Hey, first of all, it's a bad radio. The audience is wanting to hear this.

[01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:51.880]
I don't want to say they were keeping begging and pushing it. And I give these embarrassing

[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:57.980]
numbers. It's bad. It's really stupid. It's like, you know what this reminds me of. It's

[01:08:57.980 --> 01:09:02.920]
the opposite of what this station did when they had when Greg Kotest did that Phantom Polar and

[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:07.280]
the Sun and the Herald. When everybody else just laid back on the earth, they were told to do

[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:12.240]
that. I'm positive about that. And when we, we, we, we singled, had to lay kicked ass of these

[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:16.000]
idiots across the street because we don't want to be embarrassed. It's like that in reverse.

[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:20.600]
That's what this station specializes in. You know the oldest freshman about putting your best foot

[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:25.160]
forward? Uh-huh. We're always putting our worst foot forward. I thought we put our athletes

[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:42.160]
foot forward. We're kind of like peg leg baits. This is Neil Rogers. This is fine. And it's

[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:44.080]
good to lie down.

[01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:53.280]
Yeah.

[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:24.180]
I'm going to land my chin, I'm going to land my chin

[01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:24.560]
I'm going to land my chin, I'm going to land my chin

[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:25.320]
I'm going to land my chin, I'm going to land my chin

[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:25.320]

[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:26.100]
I'm going to land my chin, I'm going to land my chin

[01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:27.080]
I'm going to land my chin, I'm going to land my chin

[01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:37.520]
I'm going to land my chin, I'm going to land my chin

[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:42.140]
I'm going to land my chin, I'm going to land my chin

[01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:47.400]
I'm going to land my chin, I'm going to land my chin

[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:51.460]
When I'm back to be, I'm back to be

[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:55.140]
I'm back to be, I'm back to be

[01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:58.780]
We've got some action here

[01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:03.100]
We've got all the more dance moves on the rock

[01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:04.340]
I don't know what it's like to be impressed

[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:06.280]
Wooo-woo

[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:07.260]
What were these sorts of sets?

[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:08.400]
I don't know whether they would believe it

[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:09.780]
But maybe they just did that to shut me up

[01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:10.980]
I don't know

[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:40.920]
Could be. Could be what? Maybe it's your mama might have voted on her just to give you somebody voted on their own. Oh, I got a little one. So we got one in every category. So for we got one. Of course, that's probably all we got, but that's okay. So we got a thousand sixty seven respondents. So far, that's a whole audience. I remember we used to have a big audience. Well, that's funny because we have a hundred and sixty dollars. Yeah, at our little event. What's that could do with. Yeah, when we back in those days, we probably right now have like sixteen hundred say when we had like ten times the audience we got now. When we got to get that two.

[01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:51.820]
Before we solve it, we're going to get like somebody in that place that's got some concept of what it's all about. I guess we're not and we don't care. Like I said, the week from today is payday. Airlines, greeners,

[01:11:51.920 --> 01:12:10.680]
bail cover. Well, so what do you think about this idea of just the let's let's just stick it after they do with the. Huh? Okay. I mean, what's the problem with that? Most of our people have got computers or got access to. Right. I just got to ordering all this merchandise online and three out of four things showed up so far. And the other one I'm being very impatient on because that's the one I want the word is the dream fields.

[01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:39.160]
It'll be on the site and you can mention it or not as you remember or every now and then or not like loose change part two, which we hope you watch. We know you won't. I know that maybe ten or twenty of you watched it because it's an hour twenty minutes long. And there's a lot of stuff in there that most of you don't want to see because it's bad news, but that's where it goes. You know, don't bother with stuff like that which busy trying to get laid. Well, that's more important. Believe me, trust me. Imagine an explosion is drawn up to blow a car is trunk apart caused by a bomb inside a passenger plane.

[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:51.020]
Government sources got NBC news that federal investigators recently were able to carry materials needed to make a similar homemade bomb on a bomb a grande through a security screening at twenty one airports in a bomb of the Kenya.

[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:57.860]
And all twenty one airports tested no machine no swap no screener anywhere stopped the bomb materials from getting through.

[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:03.040]
Even when investigators deliberately triggered extra screening of bags, nobody discovered these materials.

[01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:08.280]
NBC news before when it used to go to Tom Kane chairman of that nine eleven whitewash commission on the results.

[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:16.680]
I'm appalled at it. He said he's appalled at it. I'm just made an yesterday degree. It does surprise me because I thought the department of Homeland Security is making some progress on this.

[01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:21.040]
And evidently they're not. Oh, yeah, good old Mickey churred off there. He's doing it. He's slipping to the Mickey.

[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:28.500]
Heck of a job, Mickey. Investigators for the GAO conducted a test between October and January to request a Congress.

[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:35.320]
The goal was to determine how many vulnerable how you have vulnerable US Airlines out of a suicide bomber using cheap,

[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:41.780]
really available materials. Investigators found recipes for homemade bombs from easily available public sources and brought the necessary.

[01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:46.780]
But the chemicals are the materials over the counter for security reasons NBC news won't reveal anything.

[01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:47.800]
Greetings for the report.

[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:59.980]
It's tested probably a good idea. The report itself is classified believe handled in the vice chairman of that whitewash commission says the fact that so many airports fail this test is a hugely important story that the American travelers entitled to know.

[01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:06.380]
NBC News has to bomb technician together the same materials assemble an explosive device to determine its power.

[01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:14.900]
The materials for the bomb that exploded the car is truck into the palm of one hand. NBC News showed the results to Leo West former FBI bomb expert.

[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:22.380]
I wonder if he's can Leo Kareo. Potentially an explosion of that type could lead to destruction of the aircraft said West when a bomb.

[01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:27.880]
The case of the case of the bomb that was in the air.

[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:30.020]
The case of the bomb that was in the air.

[01:14:30.020 --> 01:14:30.020]

[01:14:30.020 --> 01:14:30.020]

[01:14:30.020 --> 01:14:31.440]
The case of the bomb that was in the air.

[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:32.680]
The case of the bomb that was in the air.

[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:34.520]
The case of the bomb that was in the air.

[01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:37.100]
The case of the bomb that was in the air.

[01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:39.560]
The case of the bomb that was in the air.

[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:46.640]
The case of the bomb that was in the air.

[01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:48.100]
The case of the bomb that was in the air.

[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:52.340]
The case of the bomb that was in the air.

[01:14:58.220 --> 01:14:59.400]
The case of the bomb that was in the air.

[01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:01.980]
The case of the bomb that was in the air.

[01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:01.980]

[01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:01.980]

[01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:01.980]

[01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:01.980]

[01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:02.000]
The case of the bomb that was in the air.

[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.060]
The case of the bomb that was in the air.

[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:05.460]
The case of the bomb that was in the air.

[01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:05.700]
The case of the bomb that was in the air.

[01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:07.440]
The case of the bomb that was in the air.

[01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:09.460]
The case of the bomb that was in the air.

[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:13.660]
The case of the bomb that was in the air.

[01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:22.320]
The case of the bomb that was in the air.

[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:29.200]
The case of the bomb that was in the air.

[01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:30.900]
The case of the bomb that was in the air.

[01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:30.900]

[01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:30.900]

[01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:30.900]

[01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:32.360]
The case of the bomb that was in the air.

[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:32.560]
The case of the bomb that was in the air.

[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:35.840]
The case of the bomb that was in the air.

[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:37.140]
The case of the bomb that was in the air.

[01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:38.600]
The case of the bomb that was in the air.

[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:39.740]
The case of the bomb that was in the air.

[01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:41.300]
The case of the bomb that was in the air.

[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:43.500]
The case of the bomb that was in the air.

[01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:51.660]
The case of the bomb that was in the air.

[01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:54.140]
Fourth, polls of US troops in Iraq indicate that

[01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:55.680]
a vast majority don't believe in their mission

[01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:56.620]
and wish to be withdrawn.

[01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:58.500]
Unlike the yellow ribbon folks at home,

[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:00.220]
the troops are unlikely to be enthusiastic

[01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:02.140]
about being trapped in an Iranian quagmire

[01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:03.960]
and in addition to the Iraqi quagmire.

[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:08.340]
Fifth, Bush has posted on the 33% of the majority of Americans believing

[01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:10.100]
that Bush's invasion of Iraq was a mistake.

[01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:11.780]
If you were being whipped in one fight,

[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:13.920]
would you start a second fight with a bigger and stronger person?

[01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:15.300]
That's what Bush is doing.

[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:18.340]
Opinion polls indicate that the Bush regime is

[01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:20.440]
exceeding its plan to make Americans steer Iran

[01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:21.880]
as the greatest threat America faces.

[01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:24.660]
The Bush regime has created a major dispute with Iran

[01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:26.300]
over that country's nuclear energy program

[01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:28.200]
and then blocked every effort to bring the dispute

[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:28.980]
to a peaceful land.

[01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:31.760]
In order to gain a proof text for attacking Iran,

[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:33.840]
the Bush regime is using robbery and coercion

[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:36.780]
and its efforts to have Iran refer to the UN Security Council for sanctions.

[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:40.260]
In recent statements, President Bush and Romsfeld

[01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:41.820]
blamed Iran for the Iraqi resistance

[01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:44.060]
claiming that the roadside bombs used by the resistance

[01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:45.300]
are being supplied by Iran.

[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.060]
It is obvious that Bush intends to attack Iran

[01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:50.140]
and then will use every means to bring war above.

[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:53.640]
Yet Bush has no conventional means of wage war with Iran.

[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.980]
His bloodthirsty neocons have prepared plans for

[01:16:55.980 --> 01:16:58.220]
newking Iran. However, an unprovoked nuclear attack

[01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:00.020]
on Iran will leave the U.S. already regarded as a

[01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:01.920]
pariah nation totally isolated.

[01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:04.940]
Readers who think runs ahead of,

[01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:07.280]
who's thinking runs ahead of that of most of us,

[01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:09.600]
tell me that another 9-11 of them will prepare the ground

[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:10.820]
for a nuclear attack on Iran.

[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:12.800]
Some readers say that Bush or Israel

[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:14.600]
is in Israel's highly provocative attack

[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:16.500]
on the Jericho Jail and kidnapping

[01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:18.240]
of prisoners of the American complicity

[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:20.040]
with provoking a second attack on the U.S.

[01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:22.060]
Others say that Bush or the neocons

[01:17:22.060 --> 01:17:24.800]
working with some black-off-screwful orchestrated attack.

[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:27.400]
One of the more extraordinary suggestions is that

[01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:29.460]
a low-yield, perhaps tactical nuclear weapon

[01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:31.740]
will be exploded some distance out from a U.S. port.

[01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:33.440]
Death and destruction will be minimized,

[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:35.440]
but fear and hysteria will be maximized.

[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:37.320]
Americans will be told that the ship

[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:39.900]
during the weapon was discovered intercepted just in time

[01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:41.940]
thanks to Bush's illegal spying program

[01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:43.220]
and that Iran is to blame.

[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:45.540]
A more powerful wave of fear and outrage will again

[01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:47.280]
bind the American people to Bush and U.S.

[01:17:47.380 --> 01:17:48.700]
media will not report the rest of the world's

[01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:49.640]
down to the explanation.

[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:51.580]
Reads like a micro-crypton plot, doesn't it?

[01:17:52.020 --> 01:17:53.260]
Fantasy? Let's hope so.

[01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:53.900]
Criton.

[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:54.960]
Criton.

[01:17:57.700 --> 01:17:58.420]
That's what I've got to say.

[01:17:58.560 --> 01:17:58.780]
Criton.

[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:04.860]
How we doing out there?

[01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:06.240]
18,435.

[01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:08.640]
Our goal is to get to 19,000 and I'm not going to talk

[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:09.300]
about this normal.

[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.140]
I just made up my mind.

[01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:13.040]
You made it up for me.

[01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:14.520]
Oh, you're welcome.

[01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:16.940]
You went out there and you took that pole all over the building.

[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:18.820]
Shouted out the window, all of those old parts

[01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:20.900]
and then high-rise next door, I want to eat part of it.

[01:18:21.100 --> 01:18:21.840]
They said, hey!

[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:23.320]
They said, fat.

[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:24.880]
That old figure left.

[01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:26.400]
We don't want no part of his stuff.

[01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:27.680]
His dropping.

[01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:33.080]
20 to 9 if you and we got the old Julietto,

[01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:34.400]
that's the important thing we got one.

[01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:35.860]
So I meant the Uno, but we got it.

[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:39.500]
Out of 1,000 A2, we got one old Julietto lady out there.

[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:40.680]
Allazed.

[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:42.600]
The flagship station.

[01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:44.340]
Live in Chicago.

[01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:46.380]
Over.

[01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:49.460]
So what happens today, Chipel?

[01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:51.320]
And here's the day to talk about it.

[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:52.300]
Please welcome, Dave.

[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:53.860]
It's popping.

[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:55.520]
I'm glad you're here.

[01:18:55.820 --> 01:18:57.420]
Everybody wants to. Why'd you walk away?

[01:18:57.900 --> 01:18:58.640]
From $50 million.

[01:18:59.260 --> 01:19:01.140]
I was partying to explain.

[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:03.120]
That was a little atrocity.

[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:04.480]
Oh my god, yeah.

[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:06.020]
We're on drugs, yeah.

[01:19:06.020 --> 01:19:07.060]
You lost your mind.

[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:08.300]
That's what I was thinking.

[01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:09.200]
You went into a middle school.

[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:10.600]
You're right.

[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:11.800]
$15 million.

[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:14.200]
I don't want to let you out of this.

[01:19:14.260 --> 01:19:14.720]
It's so ridiculous.

[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:15.360]
Crazy.

[01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:16.340]
I would say.

[01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:18.780]
They're trying to shoot me.

[01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:22.460]
We'll be right back.

[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:23.420]
I agree.

[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:24.860]
Okay, 15 to noon.

[01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:26.080]
1145 in English.

[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:27.940]
We got Gildiah 2 from the Aienta Center.

[01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:28.880]
Got to make Panther game.

[01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:29.420]
I don't understand.

[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:30.860]
Any interest? No way.

[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.080]
Those Panthers are going to make the playoffs.

[01:19:33.220 --> 01:19:33.360]
Oh.

[01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:34.680]
They're in that playoff run I heard.

[01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:35.720]
Now what do we heard?

[01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:37.300]
Okay, what do we got out there, Josh?

[01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:38.800]
Hold on. Is the phone rings?

[01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:40.460]
Oh, I'm holding it.

[01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:44.220]
Okay, the meantime, well, the tribunal says Melissa Bitsnard poisoned.

[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:44.780]
220.

[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:46.580]
Well, that's 60 moments.

[01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:48.580]
Oh, that's 18,495.

[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:52.580]
That means we need just $505 to get to 19,000 by one.

[01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:55.040]
But certainly not going to get to 20,000.

[01:19:55.100 --> 01:19:56.340]
I mean, I have to be a crazy person.

[01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:58.660]
They would come and drag my ass away if I started talking that.

[01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:00.740]
Because we only got, like, how much 220?

[01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:01.840]
Yeah.

[01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:02.700]
It's almost noon already.

[01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:03.940]
It's according to noon already.

[01:20:04.140 --> 01:20:06.680]
You folks better get with it if we're going to get another 505.

[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:10.280]
Oh, that's looking really grim.

[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:11.280]
220.

[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:12.900]
It's almost an hour.

[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:15.020]
And that's a good location too.

[01:20:15.340 --> 01:20:17.160]
The QM van is that they published parking lot

[01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:18.400]
at the Hollywood Young Circle.

[01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:23.140]
And there's always out there waiting to see a long, long line of

[01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:24.620]
all-you-old Yentos from Hollywood.

[01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:27.520]
Because we know that so many of our listeners live in Hollywood, don't they?

[01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:29.180]
Oh, yeah. Right there by Georgia's house.

[01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:31.020]
They're all like having outside your house right now.

[01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:31.580]
Sure.

[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:33.360]
What? Or inside the house?

[01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:35.280]
Well, that could be our unbelievable event.

[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:40.840]
In the Interim Toxological Exam, a sobby or Melissa Vitch's body indicates the former

[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.200]
years' law leader was not poisoned.

[01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:46.020]
The president of the UN War Crimes Tribune looked to haig said, not poisoned.

[01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:47.280]
We believe him? No.

[01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:49.320]
Judge Fowl still put cod.

[01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:53.120]
Also told news conference today that no sign of the unprescribed antibiotic

[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:20.720]
RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, RIFLA, R

[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:34.160]
I am told,

[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:39.460]
two shouldn't we have? Oh Arabs how many Arabs do we have on the earth? Yeah we should

[01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:45.920]
have put Arabs on earth and I don't don't do that. What does that mean Arab? You know

[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:50.840]
some might like your people. Get out of here, semi-smiles. Yeah I'm sure. By the way we

[01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:55.720]
got another old hooliath and we got a pair of doses. We got dose. Aren't you impressed?

[01:21:55.860 --> 01:22:01.420]
Aren't you excited? Look at all the categories where we got like single digits. I realize

[01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:07.380]
that 1100 people are checked in so far. That's like what half our audience? Right. But I mean

[01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:13.200]
single digits. Asian female 25 to 54 just exactly what you guys are looking for. One.

[01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:19.420]
Non-Hispanic white female 125 what Georgia is looking for? One and Josh. Asian male

[01:22:19.420 --> 01:22:26.820]
125 what I'm looking for? Two. Hispanic white female 125 to only two. So let me take

[01:22:26.820 --> 01:22:31.240]
those. Hispanic white female 55 plus what we finally got up to two on that. They're all

[01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:34.820]
over three hour and a half. They're begging and pushing and shoving and yelling and squeezing.

[01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:44.380]
God please somebody out there please. But look on a look on the bright side. Non-Hispanic

[01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:52.000]
white male 25 to 54. That's our target demo. That's ratings baby. 573 52%. Non-Hispanic

[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:58.840]
white male 55 plus all white guys. 172 all like me. Hispanic white male 25 to 54. 132.

[01:22:59.180 --> 01:23:05.200]
And non-Hispanic white female 25 to 54. 58. That's the only females we got. Is non-Hispanic

[01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:10.120]
white females 25 to 54. That's all we got. The smattering of others. One over here. Well

[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:15.540]
one or two over there way over there. Yeah. Get out your binoculars way over there. Anyway

[01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:20.040]
getting back to this raw port story. The report was required by an amendment to the Homeland

[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:24.960]
Security Appropriations Related by John Kerry who's really scary and who's reviled by

[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:29.380]
most. Though the Inspector General does identify some improvements over last year's evaluation

[01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:32.420]
that there was no assurance that the program is protecting the nation's most critical

[01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:37.040]
and vulnerable infrastructure. It still seriously calls into question the security of American

[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:41.700]
ports. At one point noting it's not clear that the HS knows how much actual risk reduction

[01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:47.240]
has been achieved. Has been achieved. Mon. An inconsistent system of evaluation by

[01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:51.370]
Fisels was one major problem identified by the report which called for a more uniform

[01:23:51.370 --> 01:23:55.930]
system of scorekeeping. More troublesome. That is the fact that certain projects scored

[01:23:55.930 --> 01:24:01.310]
a zero. Oh. On that same 35 point National Party threat scale. But still received government

[01:24:01.310 --> 01:24:06.650]
funding while other projects deemed worthy by the OIG did not. How do you like that? That

[01:24:06.650 --> 01:24:12.650]
goes on but it be better to move to the mouth. But said it and so on. Nobody cares about

[01:24:12.650 --> 01:24:15.130]
these things. That's why I don't know what I'm wasting my time. You know between the

[01:24:15.130 --> 01:24:21.170]
CDM I'm thinking about Monday just changing a whole show all phone calls. All right. Yeah.

[01:24:21.530 --> 01:24:25.690]
Now we in fact we can have him call 100 times today. He were where I know there's a there's a

[01:24:25.690 --> 01:24:29.670]
plan here where out his vocal box. Well I know somebody who will call 100 times today. But it

[01:24:29.670 --> 01:24:37.110]
ain't anything. Yeah. Yeah. Now. Perfect. Please. Yeah. Perfect. Can I be out of here?

[01:24:37.650 --> 01:24:42.890]
Perfect. He was the one supposed to kill him and didn't do it. Relief at least break his legs

[01:24:42.890 --> 01:24:46.730]
and keep the phone out of the wall. This house rip his Larry set of you know who he is.

[01:24:46.850 --> 01:24:51.010]
You know where to find him. We know who he is. Just like a although actually we like Eddie

[01:24:51.010 --> 01:24:55.370]
Eilie. You don't like him. I like it. No. I don't like it. Why not? I mean I like that voice

[01:24:55.370 --> 01:25:01.730]
melody. I mean during that Greg Kotech that thing with the ticket that news clip video that my

[01:25:01.730 --> 01:25:09.330]
new public. I mean he was ballistic. That was special. This is not a child. This is an adult.

[01:25:09.330 --> 01:25:14.650]
This is somebody who has a business who is in business. Like a business. And he was writing

[01:25:14.650 --> 01:25:18.910]
on there like some of those entries on there went on for like six million words.

[01:25:19.050 --> 01:25:25.150]
Bablu. Bablu. Bablu. Over and over again. There's a. And this is how Florida for you man.

[01:25:25.390 --> 01:25:28.490]
I'm not saying that there aren't people like that else workers. There are. But Florida's got like a

[01:25:28.490 --> 01:25:34.370]
disproportionate number. Yeah. I think about gravity. Millions of them. I'd say about three

[01:25:34.370 --> 01:25:39.930]
million people like that. Somebody Q. A. M. Eddie line. Hello. Good morning.

[01:25:42.050 --> 01:25:45.210]
Somebody Q. A. M. Hello. Somebody Q. A. M. Hello.

[01:25:54.090 --> 01:25:59.690]
Okay. I think Eddie's already it. But that's okay. I just want to go out. That's not a bullet.

[01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:08.590]
Okay. I was looking around. I didn't put condos. Lea and president Dung Fregg on the CD.

[01:26:11.530 --> 01:26:15.390]
Kind of the kind of lea's of when you're not going to hear again and president Dung Schmidt's been on

[01:26:15.390 --> 01:26:21.230]
recently. It was on. We had a lot of CD that we did. Oh really? Yeah. Okay. I'm sorry.

[01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:26.870]
Sorry. Love means everything to say. Sorry. Go away. 5 6 7 0 5. See now. Now they're starting to call

[01:26:26.870 --> 01:26:31.090]
with how come you didn't put this on. Yeah. Oh, it is what it is. It's already done. We can't

[01:26:31.090 --> 01:26:35.070]
redo it for you. Okay. But can't redo it. And the condo. Lea's your one. You ain't going to hear

[01:26:35.070 --> 01:26:40.010]
no. First of all, every year that we do these things that I get tired of. Call out Mo with that

[01:26:40.010 --> 01:26:43.750]
station in New York. Ask him how come you won't hear condo. Lea's your no more. Okay. Ask him

[01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:47.850]
about the background that. That whole big sumis. How that came about every year. Why isn't this

[01:26:47.850 --> 01:26:52.650]
on there? Why isn't that on there? Why don't you die? That's why I didn't want any part of this

[01:26:52.650 --> 01:26:57.090]
man. I would avoid this like the plague, like the bird flu, like I chased that pigeon out of my

[01:26:57.090 --> 01:27:01.570]
living room the other day. Let's get out of here. I was screaming. I get out of here already.

[01:27:01.690 --> 01:27:06.190]
Idiot. And did. I think it speaks better when you listen. Most of the people in South Florida,

[01:27:06.190 --> 01:27:16.610]
if he asks me. Christ. W. Q. Y. M. Hello. Who you calling? Why are you? I beg your pardon?

[01:27:17.730 --> 01:27:23.010]
Can you put a bit of. No chance. Get out of here. W. Q. A. M. Hello. One of your people Q. A. M.

[01:27:23.450 --> 01:27:28.970]
I can't speak with my son being. W. Q. A. M. Hello. Our Franken does and put up his car.

[01:27:29.190 --> 01:27:35.090]
Yeah. Good. Our Franken's an idiot. Okay. W. Q. A. M. Hello. Q. A. M.

[01:27:35.890 --> 01:27:39.210]
An idiot with no numbers by the way. It's going off the year in New York. Q. A. M.

[01:27:40.930 --> 01:27:44.990]
Not there. They just couldn't get. They just couldn't get the courage up. Q. A. M. Hello.

[01:27:44.990 --> 01:27:55.710]
Hello. Yes, sir. Q. You are the Hispanic black male. Hispanic black males. Could we add that?

[01:27:56.650 --> 01:28:00.450]
No, they don't have it there. Just go black now. I'm going to put out black. We're not

[01:28:00.450 --> 01:28:04.870]
dividing the black. Talk about that. You know, we got to have locations and Jamaicans and Hispanic

[01:28:04.870 --> 01:28:11.630]
blacks and French blacks and Pollywood will get lost away. Black is black. Black is black. That's

[01:28:11.630 --> 01:28:15.910]
right. Blaine. Now we could also be chocolate for McRain-Agan happy. Light chocolate. Mocha.

[01:28:17.690 --> 01:28:24.370]
Milato. Like that. Halley Berry flavored. Whatever. No. Oh, listen. This pool is closed with it. Okay.

[01:28:24.650 --> 01:28:32.010]
This is why starting Monday. It's all calls because I like them. He really believed me. No.

[01:28:32.570 --> 01:28:36.110]
I don't care. You don't care. And you don't know. See, I'd like to keep people guessing.

[01:28:37.050 --> 01:28:42.090]
Once you start being predictable like Daniel Abaster, then you got real service. There's black is black,

[01:28:42.090 --> 01:28:47.750]
by the way. In that group. Milato. Name it. Come on. I don't know. One pops.

[01:28:49.070 --> 01:28:57.490]
One spick name. Two words. Milato. Most. Most. Most. Most. Most. Those. Those ones. And those.

[01:28:57.730 --> 01:29:03.010]
Those have got. If you told me I still wouldn't know. Those brables. I forgot it.

[01:29:04.590 --> 01:29:08.810]
I know that the elite singer there sounds like Jean Pitney though. Little bell like Jean Pitney.

[01:29:09.330 --> 01:29:14.690]
Only your only love can break a heart. What was the other Jean Pitney stuff? Halfway. What was the

[01:29:14.690 --> 01:29:20.510]
thing to Tulsa? I could. I could cheat. Well, look it up. Google it. Jean Pitney. Something

[01:29:20.510 --> 01:29:25.110]
that I was hitting. 24 hours to Tulsa. Tell it town without pity. Whatever. It's a

[01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:33.490]
softball of the theme song. The man who shall liberty balance. The man who shall

[01:29:33.490 --> 01:29:39.490]
feel balance. How about this one? I would have guessed this one. Oh, it hurts to be in love.

[01:29:39.670 --> 01:29:43.310]
That's one of the metal pancreas Jean Pitney stuff. It does hurt the whole freaking thing. Come on.

[01:29:43.470 --> 01:29:46.810]
Matter of fact, I'd talk it up and eat snack on it. It he hurries.

[01:29:49.810 --> 01:29:53.070]
You know, I once did it during the break here to stop and think it. That was say,

[01:29:53.070 --> 01:29:56.310]
well, what would the world be like without religion? Well, I mean, that's it. No,

[01:29:56.370 --> 01:30:00.370]
it would be a hell of a lot better. What would the world be like without sexually transmitted diseases?

[01:30:01.170 --> 01:30:07.090]
This is Neil Rogers. This is 5.15.2.8.

[01:30:08.630 --> 01:30:13.850]
This is at a Homeland Security Tom Ridge advising you to put duct tape on your radio when I

[01:30:13.850 --> 01:30:17.370]
raise the warning color to pink or the Neil Rogers 12-1 hour.

[01:30:29.530 --> 01:30:39.050]
When I'm watching basketball on TV, one man is denying me. Yeah, the words of thousands

[01:30:39.050 --> 01:30:48.990]
to give me. And when someone goes baseline, he starts screaming things so lazily,

[01:30:49.910 --> 01:31:01.610]
screeching like a patchy to give me. To give me. To give me. To give me. To give me.

[01:31:02.570 --> 01:31:14.090]
He should shut his fire hole to give me. When he is talking, the glare from his head is

[01:31:14.090 --> 01:31:26.870]
lining me. Where does this guy come from to give me? Everything is us and everyone's

[01:31:26.870 --> 01:31:50.790]
to give me. We should give him. To give me. To give me. To give me. To give me. To give me.

[01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:09.790]
To give me. To give me. To give me. To give me. To give me. To give me. To give me.

[01:32:09.790 --> 01:32:14.490]
George is lucky though because he'd have no idea where any sporting event. He don't know

[01:32:14.490 --> 01:32:20.290]
Dick Vitale from Tobitallis, Hara stuff. Ever use Vitaleis? No. No.

[01:32:20.290 --> 01:32:20.970]
No, no.

[01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:23.930]
Cover one at five sixty WQM, happy Friday to you.

[01:32:23.970 --> 01:32:25.010]
Happy St. Paddy's Day.

[01:32:26.430 --> 01:32:26.790]
Another...

[01:32:27.990 --> 01:32:31.650]
You know something, I experienced it the dentist last week was more pleasant than this.

[01:32:33.330 --> 01:32:35.710]
It is absolutely just unacceptable.

[01:32:35.990 --> 01:32:37.570]
You know, you learn your lesson.

[01:32:37.810 --> 01:32:39.770]
We did this many, many times and cutting the board,

[01:32:39.890 --> 01:32:41.210]
where it was beyond ponderous.

[01:32:41.210 --> 01:32:42.690]
It was just like a waste of time.

[01:32:42.930 --> 01:32:43.870]
It was a lot more work.

[01:32:44.030 --> 01:32:46.610]
There were certain people that didn't really appreciate the efforts in the first place

[01:32:46.610 --> 01:32:47.550]
when you come right down to it.

[01:32:48.090 --> 01:32:48.870]
Which, you know what I'm saying?

[01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:49.790]
You do know what I'm saying.

[01:32:49.790 --> 01:32:50.550]
I know what you're saying.

[01:32:50.770 --> 01:32:54.670]
So why are we being coerced and muscled into doing this again?

[01:32:54.870 --> 01:32:55.230]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:32:55.610 --> 01:32:56.550]
Don't want to.

[01:32:57.010 --> 01:32:59.330]
So today I'll be the last day here as to talk about it.

[01:32:59.610 --> 01:33:01.050]
So go out there and get some stuff or not.

[01:33:01.150 --> 01:33:02.090]
Whatever you like.

[01:33:02.090 --> 01:33:02.330]
Yeah.

[01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:05.310]
Ed Rampal, who was named after Edward R. Murrow, by the way.

[01:33:05.390 --> 01:33:05.970]

[01:33:08.450 --> 01:33:08.490]
Cr...

[01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:13.390]
Ed Rampal of West Cavina, California, was named after Edward R. Murrow.

[01:33:13.530 --> 01:33:14.290]
He wrote progressive Hollywood.

[01:33:14.430 --> 01:33:15.570]
A people's film history of the USA.

[01:33:16.210 --> 01:33:16.530]
He writes,

[01:33:16.530 --> 01:33:18.750]
He's here brings McCarthy and Orwell back into the spotlight.

[01:33:19.010 --> 01:33:19.410]
Good article.

[01:33:19.770 --> 01:33:20.630]
I'm going to read it.

[01:33:21.750 --> 01:33:22.170]
Like I said,

[01:33:22.350 --> 01:33:22.790]
Scurning Monday,

[01:33:22.930 --> 01:33:23.350]
No calls,

[01:33:24.650 --> 01:33:25.910]
Or maybe all calls.

[01:33:26.430 --> 01:33:28.050]
Or maybe 4,000 calls.

[01:33:28.170 --> 01:33:29.550]
Or maybe no calls will call you.

[01:33:29.670 --> 01:33:30.010]
How's that?

[01:33:30.570 --> 01:33:31.290]
That would be good.

[01:33:31.330 --> 01:33:31.810]
That's a good idea.

[01:33:31.950 --> 01:33:35.150]
We'll just call people like name Chin out of the Chinese phone book.

[01:33:35.250 --> 01:33:35.990]
Or name Groud Riegas.

[01:33:36.770 --> 01:33:37.270]
How's that?

[01:33:37.970 --> 01:33:38.330]
Groud Riegas.

[01:33:38.330 --> 01:33:38.510]
What?

[01:33:39.070 --> 01:33:41.210]
He has a lot of people to get through the Rodriguez's.

[01:33:41.230 --> 01:33:42.130]
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

[01:33:42.290 --> 01:33:43.570]
We'll call everybody who's name ends in his Z.

[01:33:44.070 --> 01:33:44.570]
In his Z.

[01:33:45.490 --> 01:33:46.290]
During Sunshine,

[01:33:46.570 --> 01:33:48.230]
we dedicated the public access to government.

[01:33:48.370 --> 01:33:51.190]
Russ Fingel proposed to condemn president Bush for illegal wiretapping.

[01:33:51.490 --> 01:33:54.450]
But Fingel is not the only junior senator from Wisconsin associated with

[01:33:54.450 --> 01:33:56.110]
censure currently in the public eye.

[01:33:56.770 --> 01:34:00.450]
The DVD of George Clooney's Good Night and Good Luck about CBS broadcast your Edward R.

[01:34:00.530 --> 01:34:02.930]
Murrow's exposé of which hunting senator Joe McCarthy,

[01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:04.590]
censured by the Senate in December 54,

[01:34:04.910 --> 01:34:06.070]
was released this week Tuesday.

[01:34:06.370 --> 01:34:07.190]
I'm going to go on and get today,

[01:34:07.250 --> 01:34:08.110]
even though he said don't watch it.

[01:34:08.190 --> 01:34:08.690]
I'm going to watch it.

[01:34:09.010 --> 01:34:09.130]
Okay.

[01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:12.590]
Taylor Garner Joe also repairs and recent books,

[01:34:12.590 --> 01:34:15.870]
including Xbox and Post-Commonist Hans Johnson's The Age of Anxiety,

[01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:17.450]
published last October by Harcourt.

[01:34:17.810 --> 01:34:21.270]
It opens with McCarthy's infamous 1950 Wheeling West Virginia speech.

[01:34:21.670 --> 01:34:24.990]
I have here my hand-list to 205 members of the Communist Party still working

[01:34:24.990 --> 01:34:26.530]
and shaping the policy of the State Department.

[01:34:27.230 --> 01:34:30.190]
Johnson notes how that number kept changing and rights of the boldness

[01:34:30.190 --> 01:34:33.190]
with which he twisted facts or invented them to make grave and unsubtantial

[01:34:33.190 --> 01:34:35.470]
accusations at a moment of intense national fear.

[01:34:36.250 --> 01:34:38.830]
This month, Harcourt is publishing Shooting Star,

[01:34:38.970 --> 01:34:41.930]
the brief arc of Joe McCarthy by Exxon New York Times reporter Tom Wicker,

[01:34:41.930 --> 01:34:45.270]
who calls McCarthy the most destructive demagogue in American history,

[01:34:45.630 --> 01:34:47.350]
uniquely villainous, his sins against democracy,

[01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:48.670]
and that they've forgiven or forgotten.

[01:34:50.450 --> 01:34:53.770]
Others are assuming McCarthy's legacy in January 2004,

[01:34:54.010 --> 01:34:56.590]
David Horowitz's conservative online publication Front Page

[01:34:56.590 --> 01:34:58.910]
asked reactionary commentator Ann Coulter,

[01:34:59.290 --> 01:35:00.810]
whom she admired in the 20th century.

[01:35:01.130 --> 01:35:02.270]
Joe McCarthy, she responded.

[01:35:03.130 --> 01:35:03.330]
Bitch.

[01:35:04.410 --> 01:35:08.730]
In 2,000 crowned forum books, Coulter's Treeson and James Herson's Tales from the Left Coast,

[01:35:08.730 --> 01:35:11.390]
right wingers attempt to rehabilitate and restore McCarthy.

[01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:15.470]
As Redbating remains lucrative, the same conservative imprint plans publishing

[01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:18.650]
another McCarthy apology by M. Stanton Evans in December.

[01:35:19.430 --> 01:35:21.270]
Grant Heslov, who could not with Clooney,

[01:35:21.810 --> 01:35:25.230]
and said they were another inspiration for us to make this film

[01:35:25.230 --> 01:35:27.590]
in compared McCarthy Apologist to Holocaust deniers.

[01:35:28.690 --> 01:35:32.990]
A.M.L.D. Antonio 64 documentary point of order was released last November on DVD

[01:35:32.990 --> 01:35:35.310]
in it during 54th Army McCarthy hearings,

[01:35:35.710 --> 01:35:37.810]
counsel Joseph Welch famously rebukes McCarthy.

[01:35:37.810 --> 01:35:41.490]
Until this moment, Senator, I think I never gauged your cruelty or recklessness

[01:35:41.490 --> 01:35:44.630]
have you no sense of decency's seret long last, sir.

[01:35:45.690 --> 01:35:50.790]
George Orwell was also backed by the actors gang's 84 dramatization directed by Tim Robinson L.A.

[01:35:50.910 --> 01:35:52.430]
and Orwell's totalitarian masterpiece.

[01:35:52.770 --> 01:35:55.070]
Big brother's thought police watched everybody to tele screens.

[01:35:55.930 --> 01:35:57.590]
Why have McCarthy and Orwell returned now?

[01:35:58.050 --> 01:36:00.890]
Clues provided by the subtitles to Johnson's The Age of Anxiety,

[01:36:01.070 --> 01:36:03.650]
McCarthyism to Terrorism and Coulter's Treeson,

[01:36:03.850 --> 01:36:06.150]
Liberal treachery from the Cold War to the War on Terrorism.

[01:36:06.670 --> 01:36:09.490]
According to Hezlov, Good Night addresses a concern of lots of people

[01:36:09.490 --> 01:36:10.810]
who have had over the past six years,

[01:36:11.190 --> 01:36:12.450]
and fear that if you speak your mind,

[01:36:12.530 --> 01:36:14.510]
if you have a question on the war you'll be called on patriotic,

[01:36:14.890 --> 01:36:16.430]
there was lots of self-sensory going on,

[01:36:16.670 --> 01:36:18.450]
and in a oblique way, our film addresses those issues.

[01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:21.670]
A certain segment of society certainly responds to that.

[01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:22.950]
After 9-11, there was a chill.

[01:36:24.290 --> 01:36:26.930]
Today's big chill saw another CBSN Command Dan Rather,

[01:36:27.230 --> 01:36:30.790]
country-western singers and administration critic Joe Wilson-Vixie Chick for being this loyal.

[01:36:31.530 --> 01:36:34.590]
The patriotism of anti-war town such as Clooney and Robbins was questioned

[01:36:34.590 --> 01:36:37.110]
of those using McCarthy attacks, Hezlov said,

[01:36:37.410 --> 01:36:38.930]
that poster boys obviously bill Orrily.

[01:36:39.470 --> 01:36:41.650]
The narrow one of Washington Post and New York Times apologized

[01:36:41.650 --> 01:36:44.450]
for misleading pre-arach war reporting Good Night and Capote,

[01:36:44.830 --> 01:36:47.130]
both best-doctor pictured Austrian nominees,

[01:36:47.490 --> 01:36:48.510]
stressed journalistic ethics.

[01:36:49.510 --> 01:36:51.410]
I asked Robbins if he'd received 1984,

[01:36:51.730 --> 01:36:53.570]
if he'd be 5-84 to come in on it today.

[01:36:54.130 --> 01:36:55.710]
See it for yourself and decide he replied.

[01:36:57.170 --> 01:36:59.250]
Robbins play a cousin Orwell's torture chamber.

[01:36:59.570 --> 01:37:03.010]
This is the Gittmu Abu-Abu-Gar-Rabla-Gram-Air Base

[01:37:03.010 --> 01:37:04.970]
extraordinary rendition edition of 1984,

[01:37:05.330 --> 01:37:06.910]
where anime conventions are held without charges,

[01:37:07.130 --> 01:37:08.650]
without trials, Geneva conventions.

[01:37:09.010 --> 01:37:11.870]
Its tele screen suggests that warrantless wiretapping fine gold opposes.

[01:37:12.650 --> 01:37:14.430]
When truth is suppressed, it doesn't disappear,

[01:37:14.570 --> 01:37:16.290]
it re-emerges often in symbolic ways.

[01:37:16.830 --> 01:37:19.050]
Orwell declared in the time of universal deceit,

[01:37:19.410 --> 01:37:21.050]
telling the truth is a revolutionary act.

[01:37:21.470 --> 01:37:23.690]
Modern parallel strigger contemporary cultures of session

[01:37:23.690 --> 01:37:25.190]
with 60-year-old historical relics,

[01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:26.590]
when Murrow Challenge McCarthy,

[01:37:27.050 --> 01:37:28.490]
quoted Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.

[01:37:29.070 --> 01:37:30.510]
During the anti-sequacy sunshine,

[01:37:30.510 --> 01:37:32.830]
we can have a quote from Shakespeare's drama scenes appropriate.

[01:37:33.290 --> 01:37:35.050]
Beware the eyes of March.

[01:37:37.290 --> 01:37:37.610]
Beware.

[01:37:37.810 --> 01:37:37.810]

[01:37:37.950 --> 01:37:38.230]
Onsen.

[01:37:40.790 --> 01:37:41.970]
He's feeling the eyes of March yet?

[01:37:42.450 --> 01:37:42.990]
All in feel of it.

[01:37:43.510 --> 01:37:44.970]
How about getting ready for Helsinki, Dimaio?

[01:37:45.070 --> 01:37:45.550]
Are you ready for that?

[01:37:45.770 --> 01:37:46.690]
Oh, yeah, I got my hat.

[01:37:47.450 --> 01:37:47.630]
Good.

[01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:48.690]
That's what it means.

[01:37:50.290 --> 01:37:52.110]
Our annual demographic survey is on here.

[01:37:52.170 --> 01:37:52.670]
Which are you?

[01:37:52.810 --> 01:37:54.470]
Which category do you fit into until, okay?

[01:37:54.630 --> 01:37:55.350]
And that's it.

[01:37:55.550 --> 01:37:56.750]
We're not putting no more categories on here.

[01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:57.470]
We're not putting black,

[01:37:57.470 --> 01:38:00.730]
like Swahili Mongolian, whatever.

[01:38:01.750 --> 01:38:02.530]
1169 vote.

[01:38:03.010 --> 01:38:06.090]
And only one for Asian female 25 to 54.

[01:38:06.210 --> 01:38:06.950]
That's pathetic.

[01:38:07.930 --> 01:38:09.750]
And it's probably Eric's wife devoted on there.

[01:38:10.890 --> 01:38:11.290]
I imagine.

[01:38:11.670 --> 01:38:14.170]
Non-Hispanic white female 125-1.

[01:38:14.850 --> 01:38:17.990]
Non-Hispanic white female 125-solument de uno.

[01:38:18.410 --> 01:38:19.170]
That is unbelievable.

[01:38:19.950 --> 01:38:20.730]
Can you believe that?

[01:38:22.150 --> 01:38:23.850]
I mean, why don't we have any young chick,

[01:38:24.070 --> 01:38:26.290]
we're talking about what we're talking about in this stupid-ass show,

[01:38:26.290 --> 01:38:26.510]
right?

[01:38:26.590 --> 01:38:27.610]
Like that article I just read.

[01:38:27.790 --> 01:38:28.790]
Why would they care about that?

[01:38:31.490 --> 01:38:32.350]
Father, what I'm saying?

[01:38:33.110 --> 01:38:33.470]
I don't know.

[01:38:33.470 --> 01:38:34.190]
Sorry, I would have been a little bit tight.

[01:38:34.210 --> 01:38:36.270]
You guys listen to a Power 96 and what they're listening to.

[01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:36.510]
Right?

[01:38:38.370 --> 01:38:40.450]
And all that HEBGV stuff, that...

[01:38:40.450 --> 01:38:40.710]
Oh!

[01:38:40.990 --> 01:38:41.530]
HEBV stuff.

[01:38:43.110 --> 01:38:45.710]
Editorial by the New York Times is if that fire needed fuel.

[01:38:47.430 --> 01:38:52.670]
This is in yesterday's New York Times, which occasionally still has some lucid moments,

[01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:53.830]
occasionally.

[01:38:55.310 --> 01:38:56.310]
Remember to be Toys?

[01:38:56.790 --> 01:38:57.390]
Of course I do.

[01:38:58.350 --> 01:38:59.070]
Wouldn't it be nice?

[01:38:59.510 --> 01:39:00.390]
Well, that's how it starts out.

[01:39:00.810 --> 01:39:03.990]
Wouldn't it be nice if just once the players in the disaster movie that is Middle East politics

[01:39:03.990 --> 01:39:05.210]
don't perform true to hype?

[01:39:06.130 --> 01:39:09.650]
Unfortunately, the events in the Palais de Nis city of Jericho this week show that's

[01:39:09.650 --> 01:39:13.690]
a pretty far-fetched thought, so the conflict continues its never-ending run fuel this time

[01:39:13.690 --> 01:39:14.830]
by Britain and America.

[01:39:15.570 --> 01:39:18.170]
The list of misdeeds is as usual, lengthy and widespread.

[01:39:18.630 --> 01:39:22.350]
The militant group Hamas should not have provoked Israel with chatter about freeing, off-menced

[01:39:22.350 --> 01:39:26.030]
a dot that headed the popular front of liberation of Palestine, who's being held in the killing

[01:39:26.030 --> 01:39:29.050]
of Rehab Al-Masivi, the Israeli Tourism Minister in 2001.

[01:39:30.170 --> 01:39:33.370]
The Palestinian President Makhmoud Abbas should have thought hard before offering his

[01:39:33.370 --> 01:39:35.070]
support for such a bone-headed idea.

[01:39:35.710 --> 01:39:39.070]
The acting Israeli Prime Minister, Ahood Olmer, should not have allowed the desire to

[01:39:39.070 --> 01:39:42.550]
do some election season muscle flexing to push him and disturbing the prison in Jericho,

[01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:44.090]
with thanks bulldozing helicopters.

[01:39:45.030 --> 01:39:48.910]
Israeli army officials ordered inmates to strip to their underwear, which many did, marching

[01:39:48.910 --> 01:39:52.730]
out with clothing on their heads and embarrassing and completely unnecessary provocation that

[01:39:52.730 --> 01:39:55.290]
trampled the dignity of any Palestinian watching that spectacle.

[01:39:56.030 --> 01:39:59.810]
Given the humiliations that ordinary Palestinians suffer merely by trying to get to Israeli

[01:39:59.810 --> 01:40:03.710]
checkpoints every day, the prison rate just reinforced the already degrading reality of

[01:40:03.710 --> 01:40:04.850]
living under foreign occupation.

[01:40:05.670 --> 01:40:09.610]
Most to blame, however, however, are Britain and the U.S. for withdrawing their prison monitors.

[01:40:10.270 --> 01:40:13.590]
They said that security concerns that British and American officials may tend to exist

[01:40:13.590 --> 01:40:17.410]
ever since the 2002 agreement established a condition under which misdeeds stood out

[01:40:17.410 --> 01:40:19.870]
in five other Palestinian prisoners would be held.

[01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:23.610]
Regrettably, the Palestinian Authority has never in the past four years met all of its

[01:40:23.610 --> 01:40:27.010]
obligations under the Ramallah agreement to spread our repeated demands that they do so.

[01:40:27.350 --> 01:40:29.490]
They've been in the Foreign Secretary Jack Strauss in this week.

[01:40:29.830 --> 01:40:31.190]
Jack Strauss, you know him a real Ahood.

[01:40:31.210 --> 01:40:32.050]
Jack Strauss.

[01:40:32.170 --> 01:40:32.370]
Right.

[01:40:32.890 --> 01:40:36.550]
That raises the question of why the U.S. and Britain waited until now to withdraw the monitors.

[01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:40.570]
This is an extremely tense time in both Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories,

[01:40:41.110 --> 01:40:44.670]
with Hamas working to form a cabinet after its election triumph, and Israel headed for

[01:40:44.670 --> 01:40:45.930]
elections on March 28th.

[01:40:46.390 --> 01:40:49.370]
There's no way the British and Americans could not have known that their withdrawal would

[01:40:49.370 --> 01:40:51.730]
be tantamount to throwing a match into dry kintling.

[01:40:52.970 --> 01:40:57.230]
Mr. Olmer may have secured a few security points for himself and his Kadima party in their

[01:40:57.230 --> 01:40:58.510]
battle with Benjamin Netanyahu.

[01:40:58.670 --> 01:41:02.670]
Be me Netanyahu over who will be elected to succeed Ariel Sheroul and how's he doing as

[01:41:02.670 --> 01:41:03.490]
Israel pride minister.

[01:41:04.050 --> 01:41:07.390]
But it's a sure bet that even if his prison rate helps Mr. Olmer win the elections,

[01:41:07.910 --> 01:41:11.310]
it'll make the job of governing and stirring his ratings in Palestinians toward peace even

[01:41:11.310 --> 01:41:12.830]
a harder after the election is done.

[01:41:12.830 --> 01:41:15.990]
For that he can thank his friends in Britain and America.

[01:41:16.050 --> 01:41:20.110]
A good column, good editor about the New York Times.

[01:41:20.370 --> 01:41:22.930]
I said one of their moments of clarity, lucidity.

[01:41:23.110 --> 01:41:24.250]
If those socks take place.

[01:41:24.430 --> 01:41:24.870]
Yeah, right.

[01:41:25.050 --> 01:41:25.550]
There she is.

[01:41:26.470 --> 01:41:27.430]
Condoleezza, condoleezza.

[01:41:27.710 --> 01:41:27.910]
Mmm.

[01:41:28.190 --> 01:41:28.490]
Yeah.

[01:41:28.850 --> 01:41:29.830]
I'm playing it.

[01:41:30.650 --> 01:41:31.130]
Yeah.

[01:41:31.370 --> 01:41:32.050]
That dare you.

[01:41:32.730 --> 01:41:33.310]
Do you?

[01:41:33.530 --> 01:41:34.310]
Double dare you.

[01:41:34.390 --> 01:41:35.130]
Double dog dare you.

[01:41:36.230 --> 01:41:37.390]
How's those noodles coming?

[01:41:37.730 --> 01:41:38.470]
I'm really POV.

[01:41:38.530 --> 01:41:39.910]
I faxed in 830 this morning.

[01:41:40.850 --> 01:41:45.290]
I mean, I emailed in fact that my dream feels pasta, whatever it is, dream works, dream

[01:41:45.290 --> 01:41:45.570]

[01:54:21.390 --> 01:54:24.990]
Please please now can't do it can't do it, Viley

[01:54:26.010 --> 01:54:30.090]
War loving pundits by Norman Solomon. I wonder if he was kin to Abraham Solomon

[01:54:30.750 --> 01:54:37.110]
You think I'll write me to Anna Solomon or maybe to Mugsie Solomon. Well anyway, he writes. He's good Norman Solomon

[01:54:37.730 --> 01:54:44.110]
In fact part of this article was adapted from his latest book war made easy how presidents and pundits keep spinning us to death

[01:54:44.690 --> 01:54:49.590]
Oh, that's like if you got your clothes in the dryer for like six weeks spinning to death same thing

[01:54:50.290 --> 01:54:54.510]
The third anniversary of the Iraq invasion is vandal would track a lot of media coverage rice Norman

[01:54:54.510 --> 01:54:57.770]
But scant recognition will go to the pundits who help to make it all possible

[01:54:59.350 --> 01:55:06.070]
Continuing with long service to the Bush administration's agenda setting for war prominent media commentators were very busy in the weeks before the invasion

[01:55:07.130 --> 01:55:12.370]
After Washington post the op-ed's page for fervor hit a new peak on February 6, 2003

[01:55:12.370 --> 01:55:18.430]
The day after Colin Powell's mendacious speech to the UN Security Council remember how vile that was yeah with the cartoons

[01:55:18.430 --> 01:55:24.690]
Post-com this Richard Cohen explained that Paul was utterly convincing the evidence he presented to the UN some of its circumstances

[01:55:24.690 --> 01:55:31.210]
Daniel some of it absolutely bone-shilling instant tail had approved to anyone that Iraq not only has an account for his weapons of mass destruction

[01:55:31.210 --> 01:55:36.750]
But without a doubt still retains them cool and wrote only a fool or possibly a Frenchman could conclude otherwise

[01:55:37.770 --> 01:55:42.210]
Meanwhile another one was posted indicated to say a stavance Jim Holman led with this declaration

[01:55:42.690 --> 01:55:48.550]
Colin Powell did more than present the world with a convincing and detailed x-ray of a rack secret weapons and terrorism programs here today

[01:55:48.550 --> 01:55:54.890]
He also exposed the enduring bad faith to several key members of the UN Security Council when it comes to a rack and its web of lies in Paul's phrase

[01:55:55.670 --> 01:56:00.450]
Holman's closing words banished out the continued to say that the Bush administration has not made its case

[01:56:00.450 --> 01:56:05.010]
You must now believe that Trojan Powell lied in the most serious statement he'll ever make or was taken in by

[01:56:05.010 --> 01:56:08.390]
90 facts of evidence. I don't believe that today knew there should you he wrote

[01:56:09.370 --> 01:56:12.550]
In patients grew among punnets who depicted the ones inspection processes

[01:56:12.550 --> 01:56:18.850]
They should raid because Sodom Hussein's regime obviously possess weapons of mass destruction and an essay appearing on February 13th

[01:56:18.850 --> 01:56:25.010]
2003 Christopher Hitchens wrote those who are calling for more time in this process should be aware that they're calling for more time for

[01:56:25.010 --> 01:56:29.190]
Sodom's people to complete their humiliation and subversion of the inspectors a

[01:56:29.190 --> 01:56:30.450]
Few weeks later in March 17

[01:56:30.450 --> 01:56:34.990]
President Bush preface the imminent invasion by claiming a televised speech should Sodom of saying

[01:56:35.010 --> 01:56:40.890]
Choose confrontation the American people can know that every measure has been taken to avoid war and every major will be taken to win it

[01:56:41.710 --> 01:56:45.670]
In the same speech noting that many Iraqis can hear me tonight in the translator radio broadcast

[01:56:45.670 --> 01:56:51.210]
Bush heard offered Bush offered reassurance Bush her I have a message for them if we must begin military campaign

[01:56:51.210 --> 01:56:55.970]
It'll be directed against the lawless men who ruled your country and not against you don't forget the flowers

[01:56:55.970 --> 01:57:01.590]
The next day Hitchens came up with an essay featuring similar assurances telling readers that the defense

[01:57:01.590 --> 01:57:07.090]
Departments evolved highly selective and accurate munitions that can sharply reduce the need to take or receive casualties

[01:57:07.570 --> 01:57:13.050]
The predictions of widespread mayhem turn out to be false last time when the weapons of the Gulf War were nothing like so accurate

[01:57:13.050 --> 01:57:18.670]
And he added it cannot be proposed as a practical matter that one is able to fight against a regime and not a people or a nation

[01:57:19.350 --> 01:57:25.290]
With the full scale of fact underway the practicalities were evident from network TV studios the American public knows the importance of this war

[01:57:25.290 --> 01:57:29.970]
Fox NewsPundit and Weekly Standard Executive Editor Fred Barnes proclaimed a few days after the invasion began

[01:57:29.970 --> 01:57:33.490]
They're not as casually sensitive as the weenies in the American press are

[01:57:34.290 --> 01:57:38.190]
And what about the punditry of after the gratitude so-called victory in Iraq?

[01:57:38.910 --> 01:57:44.290]
Researchers at the media watch group fear have exhumed statements made by prominent media cheerleaders who were flush with triumph

[01:57:44.290 --> 01:57:52.770]
Often showing elation is bagged at fail U.S. journalist lavish praise on the invasion and sometimes aimed derisive salvos and American phones to the military action

[01:57:53.330 --> 01:57:58.950]
One of the most lethal commentators on network TV was MSNBC's hardball host Chris Matthews

[01:57:58.950 --> 01:58:01.850]
We're all neocons now he wrote on April and I

[01:58:01.850 --> 01:58:06.070]
2003 hours after a sudden whose aim statute stumbled in Baghdad remember that photo up

[01:58:06.070 --> 01:58:10.930]
It's like it and just happened to be there. It's up to weeks later Matthews was still out at making catagoreal

[01:58:10.930 --> 01:58:12.390]
categorical declarations

[01:58:13.070 --> 01:58:18.690]
We're proud of our president Americans love having a guy's president a guy who has a little swagger who is physical

[01:58:18.690 --> 01:58:22.570]
Who's not a complicated guy like Clinton or even like a do caucus or monday all those guys?

[01:58:22.570 --> 01:58:27.790]
McGovern they want a guy who's president woman like a guy who's president check it out the woman like this war

[01:58:27.790 --> 01:58:31.130]
I think we like having a hero as president simple he said Chris Matthews

[01:58:32.730 --> 01:58:36.550]
Idiot simplistic was more like it and in the rush of states I didn't fuzze as in for one Iraq

[01:58:36.550 --> 01:58:41.710]
Senfist pundits like Matthews apt to sway with a prevailing wind or harboring climb to buck the jingo with the storm

[01:58:42.370 --> 01:58:47.330]
Sooner pay for you out a card air remained at the gear at Gail Force on Fox News Channel still blowing strong

[01:58:47.750 --> 01:58:51.990]

[01:59:15.930 --> 01:59:19.370]
Comes demanded should the people on Hollywood who oppose the president admit they were wrong

[01:59:23.310 --> 01:59:30.890]
Yeah, and you wonder why the public is brainwashing their brains are like much like jello like like jello pudding like tapioca

[01:59:31.690 --> 01:59:35.350]
Oh God, although I do like tapioca would like cinnamon on it

[01:59:35.930 --> 01:59:36.370]

Yeah, I imagine how good that would come in at wood buying and also in the kitchen when I'm open enough of bag of sure talking noodles

[02:00:54.150 --> 02:00:56.050]

And he kept leaning over he kept reaching out because he was playing coins

[02:01:34.030 --> 02:01:36.470]
I hate the people that played the coins. I got a posky with the coins

[02:01:36.470 --> 02:01:38.430]
And so no matter what he would put in here

[02:01:38.430 --> 02:01:42.170]
He had to hit the button in the coins and he's reaching down and every time he reached down

[02:01:42.170 --> 02:01:47.710]
He had like breathing my face and a breath like a breath like a septic tank would be envious of it

[02:01:47.710 --> 02:01:48.990]

For 20 feet

[02:02:38.070 --> 02:02:39.590]
You'd rather take

[02:02:39.590 --> 02:02:41.270]
Your SUV

[02:02:42.230 --> 02:02:43.650]
You can't drive

[02:02:44.230 --> 02:02:45.830]
You can't eat

[02:02:46.550 --> 02:02:48.170]

Whoa you like to think there's lots more fun during the soil. Oh, yeah

[02:03:05.230 --> 02:03:08.450]
Right after you think I think the truth though

[02:03:08.450 --> 02:03:16.730]
Close you to the truth to say your total is spoiled, you know, you're gonna have to place it here a dick into all

[02:03:16.730 --> 02:03:20.910]
Might as well face it you're addicted to all

[02:03:20.910 --> 02:03:27.750]
Might as well face it you're addicted to all come on Laura might as well face it

[02:03:27.750 --> 02:03:29.710]
And that's what I'm gonna

[02:03:30.430 --> 02:03:32.230]
Well face it there

[02:03:32.230 --> 02:03:33.550]
A dick to all

[02:03:34.250 --> 02:03:39.290]
About 26 and 5.62. What's the bad news this are might. We're clearance. You're a bone hit okay?

[02:03:39.330 --> 02:03:46.250]
You make me want to vomit. What's the bad news? We got a 460 oh and thanks to Marty Marty came by about three CDs

[02:03:46.250 --> 02:03:47.810]
Thanks Marty you demand

[02:03:48.710 --> 02:03:51.470]
So that gives us a brand a grand total of

[02:03:53.430 --> 02:03:54.930]
718,000 735

[02:03:56.030 --> 02:04:01.190]
Which means in the next 50 14 minutes if we got 265 bucks in next to 14 minutes

[02:04:01.190 --> 02:04:05.130]
We'd make it to 19,000 will that happen? Is there any change? No, that's gonna have no

[02:04:05.790 --> 02:04:09.430]
How much is the total 4 1 460 that's crap

[02:04:11.350 --> 02:04:14.230]
That's garbage. I mean we've been doing this for a long time George

[02:04:14.230 --> 02:04:19.870]
Can you remember any one of events like this that had such paltry numbers like these try to purge them from a memory? No

[02:04:21.490 --> 02:04:26.350]
Of course they have been fabulous locations like the one down there on the Southwest A3 was good little Havana

[02:04:29.890 --> 02:04:34.850]
And the other ones that places where nobody showed up things like that and then of course the hurricanes thing

[02:04:34.850 --> 02:04:37.150]
That's always that's always very positive for this show

[02:04:38.550 --> 02:04:43.230]
Of course the question we did have the one out there at the Shell Station where we always used to give like a couple thousand

[02:04:43.230 --> 02:04:46.610]
You know right from our university when we do there not that much

[02:04:46.610 --> 02:04:51.030]
That that looks though. Well, thank you. We're living in the past you know back when we hit an audience

[02:04:51.030 --> 02:04:54.330]
Back when we're on a real radio station as opposed to what we got now

[02:04:55.350 --> 02:04:57.650]
5 6705 60 let's take a rash of calls

[02:04:57.650 --> 02:05:01.110]
What do you say and everybody likes a rash or a bacon? What about a rash or calls?

[02:05:02.610 --> 02:05:07.390]
5 6705 60 pound 5 60 in the Verizon singular wireless line WQ a M hello

[02:05:08.350 --> 02:05:10.950]
All on you. Yes, sir. What's going on?

[02:05:11.830 --> 02:05:15.070]
FYI public use to have a delivery service

[02:05:15.070 --> 02:05:20.330]
But no, it's marketing with it. This they discontinued because I hear anything else in South Florida lack of interest

[02:05:20.330 --> 02:05:24.390]
Right, it just never it just ever pan that was just a small market. I got to ask your question though

[02:05:24.390 --> 02:05:27.290]
Where does a hat come from?

[02:05:28.010 --> 02:05:28.750]
What do you whip that?

[02:05:29.550 --> 02:05:30.830]
But oh that that

[02:05:30.830 --> 02:05:33.250]
Talk about Larry King

[02:05:34.470 --> 02:05:40.430]
I want more questions. Can you play any of the Paul Harvey bits that you have? Okay, no problem. Thanks for your bike. See you

[02:05:42.410 --> 02:05:48.190]
Yeah, well public use to have a shop for a line thing. We got great. I used it once I told it

[02:05:48.190 --> 02:05:51.850]
It was okay. I just the selection of food just leads me kind of limp. It was all right

[02:05:52.350 --> 02:05:54.970]
They showed up when they were supposed to they give you like a window, you know like

[02:05:56.270 --> 02:05:58.330]
Valor mattresses to give you a window and they show up on time

[02:06:01.130 --> 02:06:06.550]
But I don't know unless you really have the variety of other things you're looking for it's it's okay little thing here

[02:06:06.550 --> 02:06:08.050]
I made up my mind two things

[02:06:08.810 --> 02:06:12.550]
Two things. Yeah, I'm gonna do it to a cloud. Well, no three things first of

[02:06:12.550 --> 02:06:15.430]
I'm going over to Dominion and see if they have the dream fields pasta. I'm not gonna wait

[02:06:15.430 --> 02:06:19.470]
I'm not gonna waste my time calling these people. I'm sure the shipments been made all nail the pony slow

[02:06:20.390 --> 02:06:21.430]
UPS should be here

[02:06:22.190 --> 02:06:27.390]
Number two, I'm gonna throw off the other nine bags of that sheer talking noodles really yes

[02:06:28.090 --> 02:06:33.890]
Okay, no see when I made it last night. I ate I tried to convince myself. It's like anything else, you know, right when you have

[02:06:33.890 --> 02:06:37.330]
You try to convince yourself it was good. It was not it was not

[02:06:38.290 --> 02:06:41.290]
It has it is not really doesn't it tastes like

[02:06:43.130 --> 02:06:45.270]
Let's have like me to be like white shoestrings

[02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:51.510]
Like for sneakers, you know, okay, white shoestrings that you boiled and put pasta sauce on

[02:06:51.510 --> 02:06:58.530]
Mm-hmm. It's a matter of fact the the sausage and the pasta sauce and the the sliced olives that I put in a whole concoction

[02:06:58.530 --> 02:07:03.110]
That would have been fine with some cheese without the pasta. So you understand? Uh-huh

[02:07:04.750 --> 02:07:06.750]
It's just something that holds something

[02:07:08.130 --> 02:07:12.950]
Right and so far any of the low carb like breads and pastas that I tried have all been

[02:07:14.110 --> 02:07:16.450]
So that's why I'm hoping to find that dream fields. I'll wait

[02:07:16.450 --> 02:07:20.010]
But I'm taking the nine bags of this crap and I'm I'm shmit can in it

[02:07:20.010 --> 02:07:22.310]
I'm putting in a garbage bag and throwing it down the old shoe

[02:07:22.310 --> 02:07:27.170]
Not gonna keep eating this stuff just because I bought it to convince myself that it's good. It sucks

[02:07:27.170 --> 02:07:31.010]

[02:10:56.010 --> 02:10:57.470]
5 6 7 0 5 6

[02:10:57.470 --> 02:11:01.290]
I told him that we're getting all different kind of idiots

[02:11:02.370 --> 02:11:04.950]
That's your otaki true man. Those are the best

[02:11:05.450 --> 02:11:09.730]

Oh noodles great. I'll cook them up right now in fact up from this slide right down on E5

[02:11:30.870 --> 02:11:32.430]
I'll just put a container

[02:11:32.430 --> 02:11:35.630]
Ship them across the lake and they'll just hop on the Hershey highway

[02:11:36.110 --> 02:11:37.910]
And then slip right down to the interstate

[02:11:38.990 --> 02:11:43.750]
There they're there slippery. They're chewy. They're nasty. They're like uh

[02:11:44.930 --> 02:11:49.290]
In other words if you want a new restaurant somebody cooked you up some fettuccine and they put it

[02:11:49.290 --> 02:11:53.130]
All the way and give it to you you'd say you'd spit it right out you say are you kidding me?

[02:11:53.390 --> 02:11:54.710]

WCYM hello

[02:12:01.070 --> 02:12:01.390]
Yes

[02:12:06.270 --> 02:12:12.790]
WCYM hello

[02:12:12.790 --> 02:12:15.970]
WCYM hello

[02:12:21.450 --> 02:12:25.770]
WCYM hello

[02:12:25.770 --> 02:12:27.210]
QAM

[02:12:27.630 --> 02:12:30.230]
Yeah and um ask one of Q's this by

[02:12:31.350 --> 02:12:32.230]
Have fun at what?

[02:12:34.030 --> 02:12:36.010]
I don't know I missed it. I do this

[02:12:37.970 --> 02:12:38.330]
Houston's

[02:12:38.330 --> 02:12:42.590]
Like 20 said I don't get we're going to Houston she took me to Houston to Josh

[02:12:42.590 --> 02:12:47.390]
Yeah Josh is taking the first day. Yeah, it's funny. He mentioned if that's what he said I can tell what they're doing

[02:12:48.390 --> 02:12:51.770]
Um because I was thinking about that the other day about how both of you are such boneheads

[02:12:51.770 --> 02:12:54.810]
You know you don't order it would be like going to Denny's in order to bring a steak

[02:12:54.810 --> 02:12:59.850]
I'm not comparing he said for me. They're just some places that you don't order steak and here's what is not a steakhouse

[02:12:59.850 --> 02:13:04.990]
Boyd there once and I thought it wasn't a place. No, but it's not well

[02:13:04.990 --> 02:13:10.390]
I asked you what's their signature then their signature thing is like burgers and big salads and soups

[02:13:10.390 --> 02:13:12.450]
Really because it's not called Houston's burger house

[02:13:13.390 --> 02:13:14.110]
It's not

[02:13:14.630 --> 02:13:16.550]
It's a called just Houston's

[02:13:16.550 --> 02:13:19.350]
So I wouldn't know things pretty good. I'm ignorant

[02:13:20.050 --> 02:13:21.330]
So I ordered a steak

[02:13:21.330 --> 02:13:21.890]
I

[02:13:24.110 --> 02:13:25.930]
Thought it was a steak place. So today

[02:13:32.870 --> 02:13:36.690]
Well, you probably wonder what I'm doing. I'm just I threw out that last page. I was a lot of worry

[02:13:37.490 --> 02:13:39.710]
What I wasn't wondering oh, I'm not either

[02:13:40.550 --> 02:13:43.910]
12.56. So what do we got now? What'd you give me at last? Or you didn't give me one

[02:13:44.650 --> 02:13:46.830]
Yeah, well we were at 4.60 last I heard

[02:13:47.870 --> 02:13:52.010]
In other words, we haven't had an update since then. That's gonna be it because he's leaving now

[02:13:52.010 --> 02:13:56.090]
He's coming out of there already really you mean call rolling we can make them stay if we want to

[02:13:56.090 --> 02:14:02.250]
No, no, I don't know why you want to do that. You're brutal man. You are just a bastard. That's right

[02:14:02.250 --> 02:14:05.170]
Wonder your wife hates you like poison. Anyway. Oh

[02:14:06.090 --> 02:14:09.610]
Why no way hate her like poison 12.57 a QM beach. Hello

[02:14:09.610 --> 02:14:14.550]
This is not a tomb. It's the one to two hour

[02:14:14.550 --> 02:14:19.610]
Hi, this is Clay Aiken. Thank you for making my new single the number one song in America

[02:14:23.290 --> 02:14:30.330]
Now girls listen. Yes, we all have our moments our difficult times when our little friend comes to visit

[02:14:30.330 --> 02:14:36.430]
I know what you're thinking play is it true? Do you have menstrual cramps like us? Why of course I do

[02:14:36.430 --> 02:14:41.250]
And that's why the maker of America's favorite muscle relaxer and painkiller has asked me

[02:14:41.250 --> 02:14:45.530]
America's favorite key she to endorse the on you American my dog

[02:14:47.430 --> 02:14:52.810]
American my dog for those times you feel bloated you're cramping and you feel just down right bitchy

[02:14:52.810 --> 02:14:54.910]
You know when you're well you're aching

[02:14:56.650 --> 02:15:02.250]
American my dog endorsed by me Clay Aiken the guy gal who finished second to that no talent Ruben stutter

[02:15:02.250 --> 02:15:05.370]
And you know, I still can't believe you people voted him as your American idol

[02:15:05.370 --> 02:15:09.890]
I mean, I had no idea there was so many fat loser people out there who could operate a damn phone

[02:15:09.890 --> 02:15:16.210]
I mean, what did all of you call from the pay phone at the all you can eat the faithless? I mean really I have no idea what's on American my dog

[02:15:16.210 --> 02:15:19.590]
For those times when like scenes a little unfair

[02:15:19.590 --> 02:15:25.050]
Abial is to break it one on one and five sisters at every QM happy Friday and same patties in two here a couple of good

[02:15:25.050 --> 02:15:26.810]
Facts first one is sensational

[02:15:27.270 --> 02:15:30.690]
From somebody at legal impressions and my impression is this must be a

[02:15:31.690 --> 02:15:37.850]
lunatic Neil unsigned of course Neil. I was wondering you talk about how much blood shed bloodshed

[02:15:37.850 --> 02:15:43.610]
There's been in the name of religion, but what about all the bloodshed? There's been because of or in the name of atheism example

[02:15:43.610 --> 02:15:47.510]
So as if Stalin you are an essence endorsing a belief that mass murder Stalin endorsed

[02:15:47.510 --> 02:15:51.930]
But how come you never mention that well the fact is that in those discussions I mentioned it is didn't times on here

[02:15:51.930 --> 02:15:57.130]
Not only about Stalin, but how about Chairman Mao in the communist right to Chinese and then some other places those

[02:15:58.130 --> 02:16:04.570]
Teleitarianism right called imposing a lack of it's the same thing those were atheists, but it wasn't atheist killing people because they weren't atheists

[02:16:05.450 --> 02:16:10.010]
No, it was atheist killing people because they wouldn't they wouldn't get under right that is correct

[02:16:10.510 --> 02:16:15.650]
Like the inquisition like the crusades and of course that what what does this really have to do with the price of rice

[02:16:16.990 --> 02:16:21.430]
Because the fact that a matter and the fact that a matter is that atheists per se don't go around

[02:16:21.430 --> 02:16:25.170]
Prasalizing trying to twist people's arms and they even offer the camera views right

[02:16:25.170 --> 02:16:28.190]
We just want to be left alone. Thank you very much. Just leave people alone

[02:16:28.810 --> 02:16:32.790]
Just stop trying to impose your views and make laws based on this old archaic bull crap

[02:16:32.790 --> 02:16:37.010]
Okay, and you see it all over the world today. I don't see too many atheists killing people in the world today

[02:16:37.010 --> 02:16:41.490]
In the name of atheism right. Don't believe or I'll kill you. All right

[02:16:44.210 --> 02:16:48.130]
Yeah, trying to force other people to become atheists by I remember Madeline on hair. She was

[02:16:48.630 --> 02:16:50.410]
About shooting people if they want to become an atheist

[02:16:52.430 --> 02:16:52.790]
Torah

[02:16:54.330 --> 02:17:00.070]
What that was this get jammed out what is this wrong? Oh, it's a dog that's racing. Oh, it's from the dog people moderately

[02:17:00.070 --> 02:17:05.550]
This dog will be running in Monticello. Hopefully it gets it gives the locals up there an idea of what we think of the precious governor

[02:17:06.090 --> 02:17:08.130]
At least it'll give them something to talk about

[02:17:08.590 --> 02:17:14.810]
Says besides religion love you. What does that mean? I see because of jam get your about that's the name of the dog

[02:17:15.470 --> 02:17:15.870]
Greyhound

[02:17:18.150 --> 02:17:21.750]
Not exciting. Yeah, well obviously the dog racing people are p.o

[02:17:21.750 --> 02:17:23.950]
And the people at Pomfano are I'm sure are p.o

[02:17:23.950 --> 02:17:28.350]
And the people at the the thoroughbred people are p.o. And the highlight people are p.o. And rightfully so

[02:17:28.350 --> 02:17:34.590]
Because your fat ass governors doing everything in his power to again subvert the will of the electorate and take something that the public voted on

[02:17:34.590 --> 02:17:36.990]
They didn't vote on a watered down thing that would fail

[02:17:37.750 --> 02:17:43.150]
That's not what the public had in mind or did anybody else and that's doing everything in this park and the public's dispatch

[02:17:43.150 --> 02:17:45.790]
But it means that I move you know I can't help with it. Okay

[02:17:46.510 --> 02:17:49.150]
You can bring a horse to water me you can't make them fart

[02:17:50.370 --> 02:17:54.090]
God forbid. I hear the good news that I've been waiting for forget about those stupid noodles

[02:17:55.390 --> 02:18:01.430]
Lodge timing and thanks for ever sent this somebody obviously a little more coherent than the ones give me a lecture for not talking about something I've mentioned a million times

[02:18:02.750 --> 02:18:08.010]
Lodge timing for the HD DVD and Blu-ray disc optical disc formats became clearer today

[02:18:08.570 --> 02:18:11.510]
With disclosure by two companies of their initial sales plans

[02:18:12.150 --> 02:18:19.250]
The two formats are vying to replace current DVDs for high definition content such as movies and have pitted industry giants against each other

[02:18:19.970 --> 02:18:27.150]
The main factors of HD DVD include Toshiba Corp. NEC Corp and Intel Corp. All those backing Blu-ray disc include Sony

[02:18:27.670 --> 02:18:28.190]
Matsushita

[02:18:29.610 --> 02:18:32.650]
And Samsung electronics Matsushita is Panasonic

[02:18:33.750 --> 02:18:37.430]
Sony Corp said it's first Blu-ray display the BDPS1

[02:18:37.430 --> 02:18:38.290]
BDP

[02:18:39.010 --> 02:18:41.150]
So let's send you stick in your print case

[02:18:41.690 --> 02:18:45.630]
Will be available in the US in just starting in July about a thousand bucks

[02:18:46.850 --> 02:18:49.250]
Company and previously committed to an early summer launch

[02:18:49.250 --> 02:18:53.150]
Samsung plans to put a Blu-ray display on sale in April next month

[02:18:53.910 --> 02:18:58.570]
The Sony player will support a video output at a thousand eighty lines of resolution progressive scan and company said

[02:18:58.570 --> 02:19:02.970]
This is dumb full HD and is the highest in several video formats considered high definition

[02:19:03.630 --> 02:19:07.330]
As a concession to content providers the full HD output will only be available to an

[02:19:07.330 --> 02:19:11.810]
Vi-N-HDMI high definition multimedia interface connection

[02:19:11.810 --> 02:19:17.630]
Owners of TV sets without an HDMI connector will be able to watch up to a one thousand eighty line interlaced signal

[02:19:18.910 --> 02:19:21.470]
Something rather part of this is chopped off

[02:19:22.110 --> 02:19:26.510]
Sony has priced its first desktop computer that'll have a Blu-ray disparate the driver will be able to do with the something

[02:19:26.510 --> 02:19:28.710]
The right hand column of this is chopped off

[02:19:29.750 --> 02:19:31.890]
Sony will start selling these in April

[02:19:34.710 --> 02:19:35.470]
And something

[02:19:35.470 --> 02:19:40.750]
This doesn't make any sense to me because the wording is a whole bunch of it is chopped off on the right side

[02:19:41.330 --> 02:19:47.550]
A bio RC will be launched in early summer now. What about the how about the starts out talking about to Shiba. What about them?

[02:19:48.430 --> 02:19:49.450]
Huh, what about it?

[02:19:50.690 --> 02:19:55.830]
On the HD DVD side this article sucks like I said over Mac world. What do you expect Mac world?

[02:19:57.030 --> 02:20:03.210]
On the HD DVD side Warner Home video said it'll start selling HD DVDs. He'll say for 18 million dollar baby

[02:20:03.210 --> 02:20:08.150]
Want to see that? No last sammy ride. No fandom of the opera. That's a really good

[02:20:08.690 --> 02:20:14.550]
I want to see it. I know this will cost $29 each and we'll also have titles including Batman begins

[02:20:14.550 --> 02:20:18.230]
Don't want to see it constantly training day in the matrix. Fair

[02:20:19.670 --> 02:20:24.790]
Warner's a launch time in the first HD DVD contender your launch day calls into question to see this plan to

[02:20:24.790 --> 02:20:30.530]
Something in March to launch in March to Shiba said that they intense to synchronize launch of its first players and

[02:20:30.530 --> 02:20:34.390]
Available to your content the launch plans of other studios yet to be announced but to Shiba statement

[02:20:34.950 --> 02:20:37.050]
Then it's the later months you're not the content

[02:20:37.050 --> 02:20:41.970]
Out of words of this can't come on till nice month. There's no sense in launching in this month is what she was saying

[02:20:41.970 --> 02:20:45.510]
What I was sure was a circuitous way to get around to it and kill some tremendous time

[02:20:46.210 --> 02:20:48.810]
Is what I would say start with yeah

[02:20:50.750 --> 02:20:52.370]
Oh, and by the way

[02:20:52.370 --> 02:20:57.970]
Taliban video shows beheadings and other gruesome acts they got on their now. It's currently occurred just in the last few months

[02:20:57.970 --> 02:21:03.090]
Right the Taliban remember we're supposed to have we we defeated the Taliban. We'll leave them right in the comments

[02:21:03.950 --> 02:21:11.710]
There's not not and last that I saw a thing on a cbc about how old smart dad over there the dictator in Pakistan our good friend

[02:21:12.150 --> 02:21:12.950]
The general

[02:21:13.750 --> 02:21:15.230]
Pervert Wusharov how he's

[02:21:15.230 --> 02:21:18.270]
Aiding in a banana one there was one hand. They're like killing a few of them

[02:21:18.270 --> 02:21:21.670]
But on the other hand, they like the Taliban because they were the ones that stuck them in their first place

[02:21:21.670 --> 02:21:25.830]
And they like having disruption at Afghanistan. They want to have a disorganized disruptor that Afghanistan

[02:21:25.830 --> 02:21:29.110]
They figure it's good for them because it makes them more important to the USA

[02:21:29.690 --> 02:21:31.750]
How do you like that?

[02:21:32.270 --> 02:21:38.510]
Uh-huh. So on the other hand, they're aiding in a betting the Taliban who are stronger than ever and in some parts of Afghanistan are back running the show

[02:21:39.450 --> 02:21:40.330]
I poppy

[02:21:41.490 --> 02:21:48.150]
How many people we got checked in here 1294 will have over 1300 by one and cut to a clock. That's not so good on this thing

[02:21:48.950 --> 02:21:50.390]
God's Taliban if you have Arabs

[02:21:51.090 --> 02:21:53.710]
Central Asians, Chechnis, African

[02:21:54.170 --> 02:21:58.570]
The same kind of groups of people that you had in Afghanistan before 911

[02:21:59.170 --> 02:22:02.770]
Adorting challenge in the war on terror. Right. Adorting challenge

[02:22:02.770 --> 02:22:07.590]
That was another mission accomplished. You're right. There was all down there's that cure a philch. She's behind it

[02:22:07.590 --> 02:22:09.570]
Send her ass over there right now

[02:22:10.330 --> 02:22:11.930]
Scare her ass on a stick

[02:22:13.750 --> 02:22:19.670]
Now, let's see how we do with those bottom groups still a one non-Hispanic white female out of 25 forget about those young chicks

[02:22:19.670 --> 02:22:21.570]
Okay, George forget about them

[02:22:21.570 --> 02:22:22.770]
I already forgotten

[02:22:23.330 --> 02:22:26.370]
Moved in and look at these other ones mostly this

[02:22:26.370 --> 02:22:34.590]
Asian female 2554 Asian female 125 well listen. How could we have any Asian listeners in South Florida? There are no Asians

[02:22:35.270 --> 02:22:40.470]
How many how many Asians Japanese and Chinese people and Vietnamese and Korean live in South Florida?

[02:22:41.590 --> 02:22:45.450]
Total so the fact that we got about the 10 or 12 on there we're doing pretty good

[02:22:45.990 --> 02:22:50.410]
We got almost half the whole uh Chinese and the Japanese population in South Florida

[02:22:50.970 --> 02:22:54.350]
As opposed to here where we got holy and philopeanos

[02:22:54.910 --> 02:22:57.310]
Let me ask how many philopeanos live in South Florida?

[02:22:57.690 --> 02:22:59.610]
I would say yeah

[02:23:00.510 --> 02:23:04.370]
All the rest of them are here and they're all gay believe me out of control

[02:23:05.750 --> 02:23:10.370]
Dog Thompson your buddy writes and there's an interesting picture. This is a picture we've all seen bushes

[02:23:11.090 --> 02:23:15.450]
Salute uh-huh to a cameraman from his term as governor of Texas where he's given him the middle digit

[02:23:15.450 --> 02:23:17.610]
You see that yeah, of course. I have it really cute

[02:23:18.630 --> 02:23:24.890]
Dog Thompson's Republicans say bushes arrogance is is downfall arrogance. How can it be that dumb and be arrogant?

[02:23:26.070 --> 02:23:30.570]
Sit down with a Republican member of Congress party leader or political strategist me here of recurring theme

[02:23:30.570 --> 02:23:35.350]
President George W Bush has gotten too big for his virtues and needs to be taken down in notch or two

[02:23:36.250 --> 02:23:41.250]
The White House has been non responsive and arrogant in Mid-South Carolina Republican center Lindsey Graham

[02:23:41.810 --> 02:23:45.590]
Who adds that he and fellow Republicans put put up with it when things are going well

[02:23:45.590 --> 02:23:48.470]
But says problem is weird. They're a hedge when things are not going well

[02:23:48.910 --> 02:23:52.410]
And things are not going well for the troops at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue

[02:23:52.410 --> 02:23:57.930]
Public opinion polls showed Bush's job approval and popularity ratings in free fall especially among Republicans

[02:23:58.510 --> 02:24:03.930]
A new poll by Pew Research says 70% of Americans feel the president went to the rack war without a clear plan more than a half

[02:24:03.930 --> 02:24:06.870]
Said they feel he lied about his reasons for invading the country

[02:24:08.270 --> 02:24:12.530]
The president has a political ten years as minister of Republican center norm Coleman

[02:24:12.530 --> 02:24:18.230]
Normally one of Bush's strong supporters and a real jackass by the way norm Coleman former college roommate of Norma Kent

[02:24:19.330 --> 02:24:22.290]
Norma Coleman says he needs to shake up his staff and those around him

[02:24:22.290 --> 02:24:27.930]
Mrs. Cippie sender the cheerleading Trent lot former Republican leader joined the course of those calling for new blood in the White House

[02:24:27.930 --> 02:24:32.610]
Even suggesting Bush hire a former GOP senator who helped the administration deal better out with the Hill

[02:24:33.670 --> 02:24:37.070]
Republicans in both houses and Senate still fume over the aborted to by-ports deal

[02:24:37.070 --> 02:24:41.590]
He admired supreme court nomination debacle and the failure back war and other administration scrubs

[02:24:41.590 --> 02:24:44.610]
How about the Katrina which they see as hurting them back home with voters

[02:24:45.350 --> 02:24:49.110]
Others say Bush's ever against when a lawmaker approaches the White House for help adds to the anger

[02:24:49.110 --> 02:24:54.310]
They point out the White House hung south the court of Republican center john Thune out to dry as a prime example

[02:24:54.310 --> 02:25:00.650]
Thune recruited an all-out GOP effort to defeat House Democrat leader Tom Dachel one by promising to keep Elzworth Air Force base open

[02:25:00.650 --> 02:25:05.830]
When the Pentagon targeted the Elzworth for closing to the peer of the Bush for help Bush's response. Why are you whining?

[02:25:07.070 --> 02:25:10.430]
This administration needs to help us if they want us to help them in angry Thune says

[02:25:11.010 --> 02:25:12.690]
He's seen them different too in these days

[02:25:13.310 --> 02:25:17.850]
Republicans complain openly about how they feel Bush misled them on the true cost of the Medicare direct prescription program

[02:25:17.850 --> 02:25:22.810]
Florida representative Tom Fini calls it buyers remorse when he talks about finding out he was lied to by the White House

[02:25:22.810 --> 02:25:25.570]
It was probably our greatest failure in my adult life time he adds

[02:25:26.110 --> 02:25:32.850]
The anger is not limited to Republicans in old office conservative budget expert and author Bruce Bartlett calls Bush a trade-in to the legacy of Ronald Reagan

[02:25:32.850 --> 02:25:35.230]
adds that Bush has sold off both in party and the nation

[02:25:35.230 --> 02:25:42.010]
Even staunch White House defender Peggy Nungen says recent scandals surrounding the White House in Congress show a new Republican culture and different to government

[02:25:42.010 --> 02:25:47.250]
Largest William Bap Buckley the conservative conservative now labels the invasion of Iraq a mistake

[02:25:47.970 --> 02:25:52.930]
The most damning critique of the Bush administration is that it's failed to foster political service and intellectual allies

[02:25:52.930 --> 02:25:57.590]
Since Daniel Cassie seen him director the White House writers group and advisory for Republican presidents

[02:25:57.590 --> 02:26:01.090]
There are a few Bush Republicans who champion his toughest strong government

[02:26:01.090 --> 02:26:08.530]
When is appropriating in the low 40s and now in low 30s? It's safe to assume no one's running the 2008 presidential race on a platform of continuing the Bush

[02:26:08.530 --> 02:26:13.310]
Thank God the only question is it's only 2006 early

[02:26:14.050 --> 02:26:14.870]
You know I'm saying

[02:26:16.290 --> 02:26:22.550]
Right can we make it till 2008 and what kind of looser will they come up like that one other article said what kind of

[02:26:22.550 --> 02:26:24.390]
National disaster what kind of

[02:26:25.250 --> 02:26:29.410]
Terrorist attack will happen between now and then or maybe before November is this this election

[02:26:30.290 --> 02:26:35.450]
Oh surprises. Yeah surprise we go again more buildings being blown up

[02:26:37.050 --> 02:26:39.050]
Please watch here. I'm telling they won't do it though

[02:26:41.970 --> 02:26:42.910]
No, it's a conspiracy

[02:26:43.930 --> 02:26:49.610]
They won't want to well. No, not just that if they won't make the effort to even like click on there and send 20 bucks for the

[02:26:49.610 --> 02:26:53.390]
CD or the even if they're gonna throw it out like you know, I spent a hundred bucks for these noodles

[02:26:53.390 --> 02:26:55.490]
They were very cheap but the shipping was exorbitant

[02:26:56.330 --> 02:27:01.270]
I'm gonna put them in a in a plastic sack and one of my garbage sands and throw them down the shoot right at two o'clock

[02:27:01.270 --> 02:27:07.410]
I might do it on this break, huh? I said all shoot. Yeah, I shoot. I'm gonna my two during this break just to make sure I don't change my mind

[02:27:07.410 --> 02:27:09.810]
They're slimy. They're slippery. They're nasty

[02:27:10.930 --> 02:27:13.390]
They're like they're like like chew it on rubber bands

[02:27:15.610 --> 02:27:16.610]
113 NQA and when you

[02:27:17.470 --> 02:27:22.250]
Three years after several by the way, how we doing out there? I'm probably all wrapped up now. I would think well, yeah, roll you

[02:27:22.250 --> 02:27:24.530]
Roll over with a with a five piece

[02:27:26.130 --> 02:27:29.550]
Five piece band five bills 500

[02:27:32.510 --> 02:27:34.450]
So that's half of what we were hoping for

[02:27:35.570 --> 02:27:36.010]
half

[02:27:36.910 --> 02:27:43.430]
Now I said what we were hoping for was 72725 that we got us to our 19 grand that's what we were hoping for 7 and a quarter

[02:27:43.970 --> 02:27:45.590]
Couldn't do it a five piece

[02:27:46.110 --> 02:27:46.550]
Chinkway

[02:27:48.270 --> 02:27:49.030]
Chinkley Mealy

[02:27:50.570 --> 02:27:51.410]
Chinkway Chanto

[02:27:53.770 --> 02:27:54.090]
So

[02:27:54.090 --> 02:27:55.030]
Sorry, sorry

[02:27:55.690 --> 02:27:58.970]
20 when we got 18,0775 that's the last you'll hear of it for me

[02:27:58.970 --> 02:28:02.710]
We're giving the totals every now and then because it'll be going on our website you can click right on there

[02:28:02.710 --> 02:28:07.870]
We'll says run as far as the colors of the t-shirt that jackass you know all these people

[02:28:07.870 --> 02:28:12.210]
Why don't you will put it on your website and make it up and what about the colors of the t-shirt who picked those out

[02:28:12.210 --> 02:28:15.330]
There's the same color as the color of the CD fact I got my

[02:28:21.070 --> 02:28:21.390]

Okay, a little brown like on a most muskratless brown and my shoes are brown which I don't wear brown shoes

[02:28:46.670 --> 02:28:50.450]
You know, do I wear an outfit like that? Oh, there's my new outfit. That's always worried about my wardrobe

[02:29:06.270 --> 02:29:06.990]

They're like non productive creatures. I would say non productive people, but that would mean shelter like real people

[02:29:17.370 --> 02:29:18.530]
Non productive creatures

[02:29:19.250 --> 02:29:22.650]

You know minus the 500 beeslies that's 15 grand

[02:29:31.270 --> 02:29:35.170]
It's the best we can do unless of course. I was thinking I'll a rocky horror preacher show

[02:29:35.170 --> 02:29:39.410]
We could take deaf and clearance where the two individuals responsible for this debacle this year

[02:29:39.410 --> 02:29:41.290]
And we can put them up like on a stage

[02:29:41.290 --> 02:29:43.090]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:29:43.090 --> 02:29:47.990]
And let people know and hand out tomatoes and eggs and let people throw a variety of

[02:29:48.810 --> 02:29:50.910]
Vegetables and fruits we could sell these tomatoes

[02:29:51.490 --> 02:29:56.110]
Like a five bucks per tomato. Yeah five bucks per toss. I think that's it

[02:29:56.110 --> 02:30:01.090]
Just time and put like a red rubber ball in each one's mouth. Give me a hundred bucks worth and we can also put

Joy stuff there in the same stage. Yeah, but I would add come and send that listen to me

[02:30:05.070 --> 02:30:09.570]
I'd spend about a thousand dollars for that if they were $20 tomatoes. I'd buy

[02:30:09.570 --> 02:30:11.310]
Ha ha ha ha

[02:30:11.310 --> 02:30:14.870]

Three years after Sodom, New Fear is hotter rackies. Oh, everything's going on well. Oh, we're still in the news

[02:30:32.570 --> 02:30:38.070]
Three years after us forces invaded to overthrow Sodom and rackies have one preoccupation preoccupation staying alive

[02:30:38.070 --> 02:30:39.890]
Oh, let's crank up the bg's come on

I head to the march 20th invasion anniversary where I disaster dozens of rackies if life was now better or worse

[02:30:51.910 --> 02:30:53.250]
There we go

[02:30:53.930 --> 02:30:58.030]
Staying alive. That's where it's at. Where's John Rahul for that's right? He's still in the closet with Tom Cruise

[02:31:02.430 --> 02:31:06.710]
Most were gloomy at best and prevalent with New Fear is replacing old ones

[02:31:06.710 --> 02:31:12.250]
The parliament that meant first yesterday is got a huge task in terms of security life before was much better

[02:31:12.250 --> 02:31:16.890]
Said businessman Adel who's saying 45 in Basra in terms of security life before was much better

[02:31:16.890 --> 02:31:18.510]
But economically now it's much better

In the violent northern oil city of Kirkuk labor Ali Salman said before the war church were in killing cook place in secret

[02:31:27.470 --> 02:31:31.930]
Now it's all in public the meaning of freedom is different nowadays. You're free to live and free to kill

[02:31:33.590 --> 02:31:38.550]
A cautious optimism jandered by December's bloodless election is largely dissipated as politicians

[02:31:38.550 --> 02:31:43.910]
Hagel overforming a government of national unity and a wave of sectarian violence has pitched direct to the vicar civil war

[02:31:43.910 --> 02:31:48.210]
A sectarian dirty worst name more than a hundred victims at Baghdad the past three days alone

[02:31:49.170 --> 02:31:56.170]
From the relatively calm Kurdish north through the rebellious Sunni west and the fearful streets of religiously mixed Baghdad

[02:31:56.170 --> 02:31:59.790]
Oh, there's that religion again to seven Shi'ed heartlands once oppressed by Sodom

[02:31:59.790 --> 02:32:01.570]
Everyone is weary of the daily

[02:32:01.570 --> 02:32:06.830]
The bloodletting but other than that all we're fine doing well. I'm glad to see that aren't you?

Hanoi Jane honor is defeated

[02:32:18.070 --> 02:32:22.270]
Poor Jane poor misunderstood Jane now she opened up a big mouth and now mm-hmm

It won't it's ready for army traitor pico a move to want our actors Jane fine of her US sure it he work has been defeated

[02:32:28.590 --> 02:32:32.010]
Because of her infamous opposition to the vietna more in the 70s

[02:32:32.010 --> 02:32:35.450]
Of course, she was right about that. She just went about it in a way that the Pistari had

[02:32:36.570 --> 02:32:39.110]
Senators in fondus home state of Georgia

[02:32:44.750 --> 02:32:46.590]
38 to one against the resolution

[02:32:47.170 --> 02:32:52.070]
Many in the west still see her as a traitor after tripped in the North Vietnamese capital of Hanoi in 1972

[02:32:52.070 --> 02:32:55.910]
She has since apologized for visiting a gunsite used to shoot down U.S. planes

[02:32:57.050 --> 02:33:02.850]
Republican Senator John Duck was said fond of who picked up the nickname Hanoi Jane was guilty of treason kind like our president

[02:33:03.450 --> 02:33:07.590]
I can't think of no living american who's less worthy of this honor. He said well like I said our president

[02:33:08.610 --> 02:33:13.830]
The resolution was sponsored by senator steen miles who said her charity work should make up for past mistakes

[02:33:13.830 --> 02:33:15.230]
But even she voted

[02:33:18.410 --> 02:33:23.510]
She introduced the resolution, but even she voted against an actor fond of herself tried to have a withdrawal to avoid controversy

[02:33:27.230 --> 02:33:31.730]
A Republican leader forced the vote to go ahead say members of his party wanted to go out record against it

[02:33:32.350 --> 02:33:37.410]
fond of who lose in Atlanta recently acknowledged her visit to an oil gun site was a betrayal of the U.S. military

Yeah, all your parents got to bring washing your little kids and feeding them with a lot of bubble mice.

[02:37:01.100 --> 02:37:03.840]

[02:37:03.960 --> 02:37:04.400]
Oops.

[02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:05.940]
Am I right?

[02:37:06.840 --> 02:37:07.140]
Absolutely.

[02:37:07.440 --> 02:37:09.620]
And you know something now that is, another is Lent.

[02:37:09.920 --> 02:37:10.500]
Can I be Lent?

[02:37:10.500 --> 02:37:11.780]
I've asked that a few times.

[02:37:11.780 --> 02:37:12.240]
Can we not?

[02:37:12.540 --> 02:37:13.080]
It's so hot.

[02:37:13.820 --> 02:37:16.300]
And we just had a Wednesday on my anniversary.

[02:37:16.440 --> 02:37:17.140]
Was that on March 1?

[02:37:17.140 --> 02:37:17.860]
Was the ass Wednesday?

[02:37:18.560 --> 02:37:18.840]
Okay.

[02:37:19.340 --> 02:37:20.980]
See, I thought it was like a joke.

[02:37:21.120 --> 02:37:23.420]
I thought it was like an old tradition from like the ancient.

[02:37:24.080 --> 02:37:28.940]
And then I find out that Catholics actually, the really dumb ones, they go around the Shmur, the ashes on their forehead.

[02:37:30.740 --> 02:37:31.580]
I've never seen that.

[02:37:31.700 --> 02:37:32.900]
If I saw some of the ashes on it.

[02:37:33.080 --> 02:37:33.180]
Huh?

[02:37:34.100 --> 02:37:35.080]
Have you ever seen it?

[02:37:35.300 --> 02:37:35.580]
Absolutely.

[02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:36.680]
Get out of here.

[02:37:37.060 --> 02:37:40.980]
By in other words, these are people of walk around in public and they Shmur ashes on their forehead.

[02:37:41.220 --> 02:37:42.280]
It's the show up at school like that.

[02:37:42.360 --> 02:37:46.060]
We got people that show up at work in this building on the floor.

[02:37:46.060 --> 02:37:46.980]
Oh my God.

[02:37:47.020 --> 02:37:47.860]
Yeah, right in here.

[02:37:48.180 --> 02:37:50.440]
By the people with ashes on their forehead.

[02:37:50.540 --> 02:37:51.720]
For serious, it was at a joke.

[02:37:51.840 --> 02:37:52.200]
Come on.

[02:37:52.580 --> 02:37:53.220]
For serious?

[02:37:53.640 --> 02:37:55.360]
For serious because it was ass Wednesday?

[02:37:56.400 --> 02:37:57.560]
How about if it was ass Wednesday?

[02:37:57.740 --> 02:37:59.180]
Why didn't they have a lecture on their forehead?

[02:38:00.200 --> 02:38:01.480]
Well, they probably did the night before.

[02:38:01.840 --> 02:38:02.940]
That's who put the ashes on there.

[02:38:04.320 --> 02:38:05.900]
You thought they were ashes, huh?

[02:38:05.900 --> 02:38:06.800]
It was ashes.

[02:38:06.940 --> 02:38:07.280]
Wow.

[02:38:09.360 --> 02:38:10.160]
Oh man.

[02:38:11.340 --> 02:38:13.980]
Sometimes it's difficult to wash out those nasty stains, you know?

[02:38:15.100 --> 02:38:15.760]
That is bad.

[02:38:16.160 --> 02:38:20.040]
I mean, here I'm 100 years old and I've been around all this time.

[02:38:20.380 --> 02:38:22.520]
And I never realized that there actually are those people.

[02:38:22.820 --> 02:38:24.260]
Talk about brainwashing.

[02:38:24.400 --> 02:38:25.760]
You even get people doing the thing you want.

[02:38:26.120 --> 02:38:26.240]
Yeah.

[02:38:26.240 --> 02:38:28.640]
And they talk about the people with the cool aid and the poison pudding.

[02:38:28.700 --> 02:38:28.860]
Right.

[02:38:28.920 --> 02:38:30.000]
That should come as no surprise.

[02:38:30.280 --> 02:38:31.440]
You just have to lie a lot, you know.

[02:38:31.840 --> 02:38:32.120]
Yeah.

[02:38:32.640 --> 02:38:33.220]
Oh yeah.

[02:38:33.360 --> 02:38:34.660]
Well, listen to Jesus wanted it.

[02:38:34.660 --> 02:38:37.140]
What the hell did Jesus, by the way, have to do with ashes on your forehead?

[02:38:37.300 --> 02:38:38.220]
Where did that come from?

[02:38:39.260 --> 02:38:39.980]
Oh, I don't know.

[02:38:40.300 --> 02:38:41.100]
Gotta ask the Catholic.

[02:38:41.860 --> 02:38:42.820]
Well, I see.

[02:38:42.900 --> 02:38:44.520]
Well, I'm asking two of them sitting right there.

[02:38:44.840 --> 02:38:45.640]
No, the Catholic.

[02:38:46.420 --> 02:38:46.920]
I got out of there.

[02:38:47.060 --> 02:38:47.120]
I got out of there.

[02:38:47.120 --> 02:38:47.420]
I am.

[02:38:48.280 --> 02:38:48.640]
Yeah.

[02:38:48.880 --> 02:38:50.120]
Come on, Mr. Accordist.

[02:38:50.220 --> 02:38:50.580]
Let's go.

[02:38:51.040 --> 02:38:52.220]
That angel ain't coming from me.

[02:38:52.740 --> 02:38:53.440]
I thought that was ridiculous.

[02:38:53.440 --> 02:38:54.880]
I've never just redicted my forehead in my life.

[02:38:54.940 --> 02:38:55.040]
Yeah.

[02:38:55.080 --> 02:38:56.840]
You've smeared it a little, but that's not what I heard.

[02:38:57.040 --> 02:38:58.660]
As a child, I thought that was ridiculous.

[02:38:59.220 --> 02:38:59.420]
Yeah.

[02:38:59.920 --> 02:39:01.500]
There's smearing ashes on your forehead.

[02:39:01.500 --> 02:39:02.860]
Come on you people.

[02:39:02.880 --> 02:39:04.720]
Stop being morons, man.

[02:39:05.460 --> 02:39:09.320]
Jesus, if somebody took me to take like 16-stale humiliation, they'd have left over from

[02:39:09.320 --> 02:39:11.800]
poor and smear all the amone on your forehead.

[02:39:11.800 --> 02:39:12.500]
Would you do it?

[02:39:13.060 --> 02:39:13.460]
Would you be elected?

[02:39:13.480 --> 02:39:14.520]
That would make you among brain.

[02:39:15.380 --> 02:39:15.520]
Right.

[02:39:15.920 --> 02:39:17.680]
How about wave of tricking over your head and then sacrificing it?

[02:39:17.680 --> 02:39:18.540]
Now you're talking.

[02:39:18.720 --> 02:39:19.500]
Now you're talking.

[02:39:19.800 --> 02:39:20.880]
I make some sense to me.

[02:39:21.580 --> 02:39:24.260]
Now, of course, if it's got the bird food, I'll wave it too fast.

[02:39:25.140 --> 02:39:26.680]
Some of that food might just do it.

[02:39:26.860 --> 02:39:27.400]
That's right.

[02:39:28.400 --> 02:39:31.040]
And then of course, don't forget to nail a manzooza on the Adorframe.

[02:39:31.040 --> 02:39:32.920]
Outside your apartment or house.

[02:39:33.020 --> 02:39:33.400]
Evil spirits.

[02:39:33.400 --> 02:39:34.720]
People, spirits out.

[02:39:34.920 --> 02:39:36.560]
Oh, what are you?

[02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.040]
What about human races in the conditions today?

[02:39:39.180 --> 02:39:39.540]
I don't think.

[02:39:39.540 --> 02:39:41.080]
Take a look at those geckys over there.

[02:39:41.120 --> 02:39:41.560]
Would you please?

[02:39:42.160 --> 02:39:43.700]
The Taliban, my ass.

[02:39:44.300 --> 02:39:44.660]
And the shite.

[02:39:44.820 --> 02:39:46.300]
And the Kurds in the way.

[02:39:46.520 --> 02:39:48.580]
And oh my god, and the Sunnis.

[02:39:49.800 --> 02:39:53.680]
Jesus, God, are you talking about tribal people who are living like in a stone age?

[02:39:55.080 --> 02:39:58.060]
And if they're out now, we're going to make them sure they are pretty soon.

[02:39:59.300 --> 02:40:01.540]
And the women sure got a good day now too, right?

[02:40:01.740 --> 02:40:03.820]
Thank God I'm looking at so much better than they had it before.

[02:40:04.160 --> 02:40:04.300]
Not.

[02:40:06.180 --> 02:40:10.220]
Yeah, we got a spread democracy like they have in Saudi Arabia and Egypt and Kuwait.

[02:40:10.320 --> 02:40:12.280]
Oh, are the good Jordan, all of them are great.

[02:40:12.860 --> 02:40:13.820]
The UAE, right?

[02:40:14.020 --> 02:40:14.160]
Gutter.

[02:40:14.740 --> 02:40:15.000]
Right.

[02:40:15.160 --> 02:40:16.160]
You talk about gutter religions.

[02:40:17.580 --> 02:40:20.900]
Tennessee speaking of religious insanity and intolerance.

[02:40:20.980 --> 02:40:22.060]
Because that's what religion is all about intolerance.

[02:40:22.880 --> 02:40:25.040]
Your gods are going to go, oh my god, I got the good god.

[02:40:25.040 --> 02:40:25.880]
You're going to hell.

[02:40:25.880 --> 02:40:33.900]
Now, now I got the virgins down and then I'm at Tennessee can sell licensed plates that say choose life just like Florida,

[02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:35.380]
just like your fat ass governor, right?

[02:40:35.520 --> 02:40:35.660]
That's right.

[02:40:36.380 --> 02:40:40.140]
And even though it does not for a moment an abortion rights message, a federal appeals court rule today.

[02:40:41.700 --> 02:40:52.320]
The ACLU of Tennessee had sued over the especially licensed plate approved by the Tennessee legislature in 2003 and went eroding against the tag from a lower court that said it illegally promoted only one side of the abortion debate.

[02:40:53.700 --> 02:41:08.080]
Although in this exercise of government one side and this with respect to a very contentious political issue may be advised, we are unable to conclude that the Tennessee statute contravenes the first amendment judge John M. Rogers, no relation said they to the one ruling by a three judge panel of the 60

[02:41:08.080 --> 02:41:09.760]
assertive appeal in Cincinnati.

[02:41:10.860 --> 02:41:20.300]
Government can express public policy views by a lot of way you do understand the South Dakota thing that whole thing they're trying to do up there with the abortion is to try to make that the test case of the Supreme Court,

[02:41:20.300 --> 02:41:21.660]
not the guy not to use on right.

[02:41:22.240 --> 02:41:27.260]
They got Sam a leader one there, so they want to like send and the Supreme Court by the way in for the hear it but nevertheless they're trying.

[02:41:28.300 --> 02:41:39.760]
The government can express public policy views by listening private volunteers to disseminate its message and there's no principle under which the first amendment can be read the prohibitive government from doing so because the views are particularly controversial or politically divisive.

[02:41:39.820 --> 02:41:43.600]
Whatever that means sounds like double talk to me sounds like something out Kelly would have said.

[02:41:44.660 --> 02:41:55.180]
Federal courts have been divided over license plate programs in a dozen states like Florida or constitutional last year the US Supreme Court let's stand lower court ruling that said similar South Carolina license plates violated the first amendment.

[02:41:55.940 --> 02:42:08.040]
Let me read that again last year the UN course that was last year Supreme Court say Tennessee drivers paying extra fee for the tunes like played in the proceeds go to new life resources and anti abortion group you know cost a lot for those guns and bullets.

[02:42:10.120 --> 02:42:20.700]
The plates had stood considerable debate governor Phil breds and let the measure become law but the client decided and yours lawmakers to develop a new approach to deciding which causes would benefit from the sale of specialty plates.

[02:42:21.500 --> 02:42:32.880]
Tennessee's got more than 120 specialty plates most of them saluting unconversial subjects like the Tennessee Titans football team those smokies and the Tennessee walking horse and the Tennessee walking horses asked.

[02:42:34.320 --> 02:42:40.500]
So even the governor of Tennessee is more enlightened than the governor of Florida which ain't saying much your fat ass governor with his dysfunctional family.

[02:42:41.320 --> 02:42:45.840]
By the way how's the chief doing there chief Timiny how's this kid doing at 45 million.

[02:42:46.080 --> 02:42:47.280]
Oh yeah we'll see him do more.

[02:42:47.780 --> 02:42:53.840]
We got the rungle kids to consent with this matter fact I think we're hearing just about as much about that deal is we are about Ariel Sharon.

[02:42:55.560 --> 02:43:00.620]
I'm telling you man two more two more pro home in touch and that would have put him over the edge tumor.

[02:43:02.400 --> 02:43:07.640]
14119 maybe he's doing the same stuff that Milosevic was taken that could be it.

[02:43:07.720 --> 02:43:09.120]
First group.

[02:43:12.980 --> 02:43:17.880]
I talk to see I'm a fee was very tell.

[02:43:18.580 --> 02:43:19.080]
Absolutely.

[02:43:19.080 --> 02:43:20.740]
This is the reason.

[02:43:21.600 --> 02:43:22.420]
The.

[02:43:22.420 --> 02:43:27.720]
For me or they have the big convention.

[02:43:29.920 --> 02:43:31.560]
The important.

[02:43:32.120 --> 02:43:35.740]
I don't idea what I was about to see.

[02:43:36.300 --> 02:43:38.220]
Oh they were speaking in tone.

[02:43:39.520 --> 02:43:40.340]
That's a me.

[02:43:40.340 --> 02:43:41.020]
I believe.

[02:43:42.520 --> 02:43:44.300]
This kind of fun.

[02:43:45.340 --> 02:43:47.640]
This is get out of my mouth.

[02:43:49.100 --> 02:43:50.440]
Speaking time.

[02:43:52.380 --> 02:43:53.300]
They got me believe.

[02:43:53.900 --> 02:43:54.600]
I can't wait.

[02:43:55.160 --> 02:43:56.460]
From side to side.

[02:43:56.460 --> 02:43:57.060]
I can't wait.

[02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:00.320]
I can't wait.

[02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:02.180]
I can't wait.

[02:44:03.080 --> 02:44:04.820]
I can't wait.

[02:44:04.820 --> 02:44:04.960]
I can't wait.

[02:44:04.960 --> 02:44:05.000]
I can't wait.

[02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:05.880]
I can't wait.

[02:44:05.880 --> 02:44:06.400]
I can't wait.

[02:44:06.400 --> 02:44:08.500]
I can't wait.

[02:44:08.500 --> 02:44:08.660]
I can't wait.

[02:44:08.880 --> 02:44:09.100]
I can't wait.

[02:44:10.020 --> 02:44:11.180]
I can't wait.

[02:44:12.760 --> 02:44:14.500]
I can't wait.

[02:44:14.500 --> 02:44:25.860]
I can't wait.

[02:44:25.860 --> 02:44:36.740]
I can't wait.

[02:44:36.740 --> 02:44:37.340]
I can't wait.

[02:44:43.860 --> 02:44:45.980]
I can't wait.

[02:44:46.160 --> 02:44:51.400]
Who told you to go.

[02:44:51.400 --> 02:44:54.220]
Who told you to go.

[02:44:54.220 --> 02:44:54.380]
Tell me now.

[02:44:54.380 --> 02:44:55.240]
Who said that.

[02:44:55.240 --> 02:44:55.240]

[02:44:55.240 --> 02:44:55.240]

[02:44:55.240 --> 02:44:55.600]
God followed cheer.

[02:44:55.620 --> 02:44:55.620]

[02:44:55.620 --> 02:44:55.620]

[02:44:55.620 --> 02:44:55.800]
Call the ambulance!

[02:44:55.820 --> 02:44:55.820]

[02:44:55.820 --> 02:44:55.840]
olive wrap.

[02:44:57.620 --> 02:44:58.640]
I'm not a bad guy, I'm a bad guy.

[02:44:58.640 --> 02:45:00.780]
I'm a bad guy, I'm a bad guy.

[02:45:00.780 --> 02:45:01.340]
I'm a bad guy, I'm a bad guy.

[02:45:01.740 --> 02:45:03.180]
I'm a bad guy, I'm a bad guy.

[02:45:03.840 --> 02:45:04.820]
I'm a bad guy, I'm a bad guy.

[02:45:04.860 --> 02:45:07.700]
I'm a bad guy, I'm a bad guy.

[02:45:08.040 --> 02:45:11.220]
I'm a bad guy, I'm a bad guy.

[02:45:11.220 --> 02:45:14.220]
I'm a bad guy, I'm a bad guy.

[02:45:14.220 --> 02:45:16.580]
I'm a bad guy, I'm a bad guy.

[02:45:16.860 --> 02:45:17.440]
I'm a bad guy, I'm a bad guy.

[02:45:17.440 --> 02:45:17.920]
I'm a bad guy, I'm a bad guy.

[02:45:17.920 --> 02:45:20.780]
I'm a bad guy, I'm a bad guy.

[02:45:20.780 --> 02:45:22.540]
I'm a bad guy, I'm a bad guy.

[02:45:22.640 --> 02:45:25.820]
I'm a bad guy, I'm a bad guy.

[02:45:36.580 --> 02:45:39.420]
I'm a bad guy, I'm a bad guy.

[02:45:39.420 --> 02:45:39.420]

[02:45:39.420 --> 02:45:39.460]
I'm a bad guy, I'm a bad guy.

[02:45:39.460 --> 02:45:39.460]

[02:45:39.460 --> 02:45:39.460]

[02:45:39.460 --> 02:45:39.460]

[02:45:39.460 --> 02:45:39.460]

[02:45:39.460 --> 02:45:39.460]

[02:45:39.560 --> 02:45:40.920]
I'm a bad guy, I'm a bad guy.

[02:45:40.920 --> 02:45:42.620]
I'm a bad guy, I'm a bad guy.

[02:45:42.620 --> 02:45:43.740]
I'm a bad guy, I'm a bad guy.

[02:45:43.740 --> 02:45:45.620]
I'm a bad guy, I'm a bad guy.

[02:45:46.140 --> 02:45:48.840]
I'm a bad guy, I'm a bad guy.

[02:45:48.840 --> 02:45:55.800]
I'm a bad guy, I'm a bad guy.

[02:46:24.100 --> 02:46:24.440]
I'm a bad guy, I'm a bad guy.

[02:46:24.460 --> 02:46:24.480]
I'm a bad guy, I'm a bad guy.

[02:46:25.100 --> 02:46:25.440]
KForugh.

[02:46:25.540 --> 02:46:25.540]

[02:46:25.540 --> 02:46:29.300]
All the fairytales, all the bubble-mises, all the time, and that's why the world is in the shape it's in today.

[02:46:29.740 --> 02:46:34.520]
I know in Northern Ireland, speaking of St. Paddy's Day, a good old time religion man, it really brings all the people together.

[02:46:34.920 --> 02:46:36.680]
So they can throw rocks at each other and kill each other.

[02:46:37.100 --> 02:46:40.560]
And maybe an occasional una bomba, pecania, or garande, is the case maybe.

[02:46:42.020 --> 02:46:45.000]
All of these things. Not to mention, of course, the Jews and the Erragans.

[02:46:46.980 --> 02:46:49.180]
1354 folks have checked in today. That's not too bad, huh?

[02:46:49.480 --> 02:46:51.920]
And then over the weekend, by Monday morning, we'll have like two million, right?

[02:46:52.220 --> 02:46:52.740]
Right. Easy.

[02:46:52.740 --> 02:46:55.680]
Then, over the weekend, as when all the old Cuban women are going to check in.

[02:46:55.880 --> 02:46:56.900]
And all the old Puerto Rican women.

[02:46:58.260 --> 02:46:59.380]
Aren't you interested in that?

[02:47:00.180 --> 02:47:00.400]
No.

[02:47:01.220 --> 02:47:03.860]
Hispanic white females under 25, we got three.

[02:47:04.040 --> 02:47:07.640]
Now, that is interesting. That is more interesting today.

[02:47:07.840 --> 02:47:13.640]
The phrase, Hispanic white female under 25, three, but non-Hispanic white female under 25, one.

[02:47:13.960 --> 02:47:15.940]
So no anglais. We got, is he what I'm saying?

[02:47:16.220 --> 02:47:16.460]
Uh-huh.

[02:47:16.780 --> 02:47:17.740]
Romeo and a ganglet.

[02:47:18.360 --> 02:47:19.280]
We got who yet?

[02:47:19.900 --> 02:47:20.900]
Three, but only one.

[02:47:20.900 --> 02:47:24.080]
Now, that's pretty interesting, huh? Of course, the show, it man, it was Cuban women.

[02:47:25.200 --> 02:47:29.500]
It was young Cuban women. It was hop-blooded young Cuban ladies, man. That's where it's at.

[02:47:30.140 --> 02:47:30.960]
Is it? I wouldn't know.

[02:47:31.080 --> 02:47:33.340]
Yeah, I don't know. You tell me the ones that are leading with all that jewelry?

[02:47:33.660 --> 02:47:34.800]
I can't tell you anything.

[02:47:35.300 --> 02:47:35.660]
And it's you.

[02:47:35.660 --> 02:47:37.120]
Not a Cuban. Never had the pleasure.

[02:47:37.820 --> 02:47:41.180]
You never had the pleasure of interacting in any way, sure, perform with a young Cuban lady?

[02:47:41.300 --> 02:47:45.140]
I went out on one date once with one, and nothing came of it.

[02:47:45.600 --> 02:47:46.380]
Really? Really?

[02:47:46.480 --> 02:47:49.400]
Now, what about you, Josh? You've a man of the world.

[02:47:49.980 --> 02:47:51.140]
This man of the scene?

[02:47:51.420 --> 02:47:52.120]
Have I been with a Cuban?

[02:47:52.600 --> 02:47:53.500]
Yeah, I have.

[02:47:53.900 --> 02:47:54.820]
What about girl?

[02:47:56.700 --> 02:47:58.380]
Oh, that was so cool.

[02:47:58.760 --> 02:47:59.900]
Oh, that was a little funny.

[02:48:00.060 --> 02:48:02.140]
I said to you up in the radio over there. That was bad.

[02:48:02.520 --> 02:48:07.760]
Well, the way you're the one that said it, you should have said when a Cuban chick is what you should have said for quite a lot.

[02:48:07.800 --> 02:48:09.620]
You're a man of the same age. You've been chicken.

[02:48:10.220 --> 02:48:11.600]
I bet she was in good shape.

[02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:13.460]
Come on.

[02:48:13.680 --> 02:48:14.000]
He was.

[02:48:14.440 --> 02:48:14.760]
Yeah.

[02:48:14.900 --> 02:48:16.700]
I've been with a plot of Reacon, too.

[02:48:17.260 --> 02:48:17.520]
Reacon?

[02:48:17.520 --> 02:48:19.860]
Oh, and a George couldn't get past the smell.

[02:48:20.200 --> 02:48:22.840]
Now, I just had to take a joke. It's just a joke.

[02:48:23.080 --> 02:48:23.140]
Oh, I see.

[02:48:23.140 --> 02:48:24.120]
But that's what you always say.

[02:48:24.700 --> 02:48:25.160]
I don't.

[02:48:25.260 --> 02:48:26.600]
Part of weekends don't smell bad.

[02:48:26.940 --> 02:48:27.700]
I don't say that.

[02:48:28.080 --> 02:48:29.380]
Oh, I would just joke it.

[02:48:29.500 --> 02:48:31.440]
Well, I figured if I got him, I'd get you, too.

[02:48:31.560 --> 02:48:31.980]
I don't know.

[02:48:32.140 --> 02:48:37.060]
Two birds with one bullet, just like that magic bullet, the Arlene Spectrified on the stretcher, and part of the hospital.

[02:48:37.260 --> 02:48:38.200]
What are you talking about?

[02:48:38.300 --> 02:48:39.220]
Is Josh been with a squad?

[02:48:40.040 --> 02:48:40.500]
I have not.

[02:48:40.740 --> 02:48:41.760]
All right. Well, I got one on it.

[02:48:41.820 --> 02:48:42.540]
You got him beat there.

[02:48:42.680 --> 02:48:43.420]
And the Guamian.

[02:48:45.060 --> 02:48:45.860]
Fats Domino.

[02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:46.820]
Here's some good news.

[02:48:47.080 --> 02:48:51.360]
We're walking into New Orleans, his Katrina Flutter house at Gutted in full of treasures this week.

[02:48:51.740 --> 02:48:55.620]
As a crew from the Louisiana State Museum arrived in the lower 9th Ward of Selvets, the beloved musicians.

[02:48:56.020 --> 02:48:59.160]
Two Steinway Grand Pianoes and a smaller record, World Serpiano.

[02:48:59.200 --> 02:49:02.260]
G that it was a World Serp, that sat at the foot of his big bed.

[02:49:02.400 --> 02:49:03.760]
Next week, huge jar of pickled pig's feet.

[02:49:04.080 --> 02:49:05.160]
Oh, no.

[02:49:06.080 --> 02:49:07.480]
I'd rather eat those slimy noodles.

[02:49:08.380 --> 02:49:09.160]
Pickled pig's feet.

[02:49:09.200 --> 02:49:11.820]
They had a thing on the news the other day about all those pickles.

[02:49:12.560 --> 02:49:15.620]
Pigs feet that they export from England all over the world.

[02:49:15.700 --> 02:49:20.540]
Well, when you remember in standing in the shadows of Motown, to see where they were gravitated at between concert stops,

[02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:24.460]
they kicked the one brother right out of the car because he had the pickled pig's feet.

[02:49:24.500 --> 02:49:24.640]
Oh.

[02:49:24.940 --> 02:49:28.040]
They had the smell, the stench, and they were all gagging and puking and the...

[02:49:28.040 --> 02:49:28.960]
Oh, like that.

[02:49:29.860 --> 02:49:35.220]
The museum is negotiating with the Domino family to send the pianos and further deterioration include them in a plant national tour in New exhibit,

[02:49:35.560 --> 02:49:37.380]
about the August hurricane and subsequent flooding.

[02:49:37.600 --> 02:49:40.180]
It's a Greg Lambousi, director of collections of the museum.

[02:49:40.700 --> 02:49:44.140]
Fats was rescued by a boat, August 29th, as the flood of water's rosiness neighborhood.

[02:49:44.660 --> 02:49:48.560]
Domino's blonde brick house did the corner of Captain St. Claude Avenue's as a rock and roll shrine.

[02:49:49.420 --> 02:49:51.140]
It's windows sealed with hurricane shutters.

[02:49:51.160 --> 02:49:52.540]
The house was as dark as a tomb.

[02:49:53.100 --> 02:49:57.320]
State Museum of Fishers and a work crew wearing white uniforms headed to the home of the Psalm demeanor of archaeologists.

[02:49:57.780 --> 02:50:02.160]
The first discover was an overturned legless white stoneway besides a muck-filled fish tank.

[02:50:02.920 --> 02:50:03.960]
The rest of the large room was empty.

[02:50:04.040 --> 02:50:05.680]
It's well wrapped with a 10 foot high watermark.

[02:50:05.680 --> 02:50:10.640]
It took six officials and worked men to write up the piano, which had a keyboard that looked like an old man with just a few teeth.

[02:50:10.820 --> 02:50:11.600]
Oh, God.

[02:50:11.840 --> 02:50:13.220]
Oh, yeah, he was a woodbind neck, I yesterday.

[02:50:14.340 --> 02:50:15.600]
Boy, he smelled it, everybody.

[02:50:16.580 --> 02:50:17.380]
Anyway, so...

[02:50:17.380 --> 02:50:18.680]
Oh, it wants to pay some...

[02:50:20.540 --> 02:50:21.340]
Oh, oh...

[02:50:21.340 --> 02:50:27.460]
Also on the floor lay a plastic and case holder cover that activity scene on one side and a pray to obtain favors on the other.

[02:50:27.800 --> 02:50:30.040]
Now we know why the Lord spared Fats housing.

[02:50:30.620 --> 02:50:31.680]
This is the new...

[02:50:32.300 --> 02:50:33.520]
This is the new...

[02:50:33.520 --> 02:50:35.660]
This is the new...

[02:50:35.660 --> 02:50:36.420]
This is K-pan.

[02:50:36.420 --> 02:50:36.420]

[02:50:36.420 --> 02:50:36.420]

[02:50:37.800 --> 02:50:39.120]
Yeah.

[02:50:39.120 --> 02:50:39.140]
Oh.

[02:50:39.640 --> 02:50:39.960]
Your sis, please read this song.

[02:50:39.960 --> 02:50:39.960]

[02:50:39.960 --> 02:50:39.960]

[02:50:40.040 --> 02:50:40.040]

[02:50:40.040 --> 02:50:40.940]
Oh, that's quite an exciting thing.

[02:50:41.160 --> 02:50:41.860]
Sure.

[02:50:42.960 --> 02:50:46.860]
W-K-A-L.

[02:50:48.880 --> 02:50:50.640]
Thank you for listening.

[02:50:52.180 --> 02:50:58.960]
Oh, and let's start by connecting back a bit later.

[02:50:58.960 --> 02:50:59.080]
Yeah.

[02:50:59.080 --> 02:50:59.080]

[02:50:59.080 --> 02:51:05.640]
Her example is Jiro Carne.

[02:51:05.640 --> 02:51:05.640]

[02:51:05.640 --> 02:51:05.640]

[02:51:05.640 --> 02:51:05.640]

[02:51:05.640 --> 02:51:05.640]

[02:51:05.640 --> 02:51:05.640]

[02:51:09.160 --> 02:51:11.460]
That's three-part in Game Witch.

[02:51:12.320 --> 02:51:16.480]
Don't go to the bottom of my TV.

[02:51:17.700 --> 02:51:20.240]
He's president of the f***ing hole.

[02:51:20.820 --> 02:51:25.340]
Repel against muscle-in and in articulate idiot.

[02:51:26.100 --> 02:51:31.720]
I don't know why they were the ones that got out of the blue season.

[02:51:32.280 --> 02:51:34.280]
First news in this for you.

[02:51:34.280 --> 02:51:35.720]
That's your movie president.

[02:51:39.180 --> 02:51:40.160]
F***ing hole.

[02:51:41.260 --> 02:51:46.440]
Oh what I get to have both ones more

[02:51:47.280 --> 02:51:51.300]
And get to window-voted more.

[02:51:54.140 --> 02:52:02.280]
If you want this, come to the bottom of this drumming stupidity.

[02:52:04.840 --> 02:52:07.660]
Find this one and get rich kid.

[02:52:08.480 --> 02:52:10.880]
No, no, no, no, he's even.

[02:52:11.540 --> 02:52:13.000]
Lover than me.

[02:52:13.420 --> 02:52:16.240]
I'll be his president of f***ing hole.

[02:52:16.900 --> 02:52:18.860]
Yeah, don't care what it's all.

[02:52:19.360 --> 02:52:22.740]
You got a man by hook or a hook with a Christian.

[02:52:23.120 --> 02:52:25.960]
All it knows what's best for you and I.

[02:52:26.340 --> 02:52:28.140]
But don't go fear it.

[02:52:28.280 --> 02:52:30.600]
We've got a great leader in this.

[02:52:31.200 --> 02:52:31.840]
With president.

[02:52:34.480 --> 02:52:34.800]
F***ing hole.

[02:52:34.800 --> 02:52:35.740]
Okay, 158.

[02:52:35.840 --> 02:52:36.780]
Don't forget we've got the a-

[02:52:37.120 --> 02:52:37.440]
A-

[02:52:37.440 --> 02:52:37.760]
A-

[02:52:37.760 --> 02:52:40.080]
A parents are going to be at.

[02:52:40.600 --> 02:52:42.620]
Can I sit on the right and cut the crap you've been at?

[02:52:43.120 --> 02:52:45.580]
Today, tomorrow and Sunday, you're going to be running your own today.

[02:52:45.880 --> 02:52:46.420]
Just today, man.

[02:52:46.560 --> 02:52:46.860]
Come by.

[02:52:46.960 --> 02:52:48.280]
But today, a man dog will be there.

[02:52:49.020 --> 02:52:51.160]
At 49's grill, 5181, sheer and screen-huller.

[02:52:51.260 --> 02:52:52.840]
Come by with a bag of money and make us feel better.

[02:52:53.220 --> 02:52:54.840]
Let's get to that final goal of 20 grand.

[02:52:54.980 --> 02:52:55.700]
Isn't that the final goal?

[02:52:56.380 --> 02:52:56.700]
Yeah.

[02:52:57.460 --> 02:52:57.820]
Yeah.

[02:52:57.900 --> 02:52:58.260]
Yeah.

[02:52:59.400 --> 02:52:59.920]
Something like that.

[02:52:59.920 --> 02:53:01.700]
We can leave it up there for freaking every now.

[02:53:01.980 --> 02:53:03.120]
It's going to be a toll down.

[02:53:03.220 --> 02:53:03.260]
It's going to be a toll down.

[02:53:03.340 --> 02:53:08.920]
For the next 10 years until we get to $100,000 until every last CD, old key chain, every

[02:53:08.920 --> 02:53:13.000]
t-shirt with those baggy colors on it till everything is sold, it's going to be on there,

[02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:13.160]
right?

[02:53:13.640 --> 02:53:13.800]
Right.

[02:53:14.660 --> 02:53:18.060]
We've even got an old bottle of olive oil that you left here will sleep be selling that to.

[02:53:18.160 --> 02:53:18.340]
Right.

[02:53:18.500 --> 02:53:20.540]
I'm going to smear that on my noodles right at two o'clock.

[02:53:21.300 --> 02:53:22.520]
There's a good idea for the weekend.

[02:53:23.700 --> 02:53:24.540]
Something we can do.

[02:53:24.880 --> 02:53:25.540]
Keep you off the streets.

[02:53:25.540 --> 02:53:26.260]
What's that?

[02:53:26.440 --> 02:53:27.240]
It's a cool play-babe ball.

[02:53:27.880 --> 02:53:30.940]
Let's abuse some more prisoners.

[02:53:31.340 --> 02:53:31.520]
Oh!

[02:53:32.020 --> 02:53:34.420]
Let's scream nice and loud.

[02:53:35.260 --> 02:53:38.420]
Get me some wires and a battery pack.

[02:53:38.440 --> 02:53:38.880]
Oh, right.

[02:53:39.220 --> 02:53:43.360]
I don't care if they ain't from my rack to be used.

[02:53:43.620 --> 02:53:50.680]
Use you to the torture cause they're just laying their game in the past.

[02:53:51.320 --> 02:53:54.640]
It had to be worse with the dumb.

[02:53:55.020 --> 02:53:55.340]
Oh!

[02:53:55.520 --> 02:53:55.520]

[02:53:55.520 --> 02:53:55.520]

[02:53:55.520 --> 02:53:55.520]

[02:53:55.520 --> 02:53:55.520]

[02:53:55.520 --> 02:53:55.520]

[02:53:55.520 --> 02:53:55.520]

[02:53:55.520 --> 02:53:55.520]

[02:53:55.520 --> 02:53:55.520]

[02:53:55.520 --> 02:53:55.520]

[02:53:55.520 --> 02:53:55.520]

[02:53:55.520 --> 02:53:55.520]

[02:53:55.520 --> 02:53:55.520]

[02:53:55.520 --> 02:53:55.520]

[02:53:55.520 --> 02:53:55.520]

[02:53:55.520 --> 02:53:55.520]

[02:53:55.520 --> 02:53:55.520]

[02:53:55.520 --> 02:53:57.940]
Bye bye bye!

[02:53:58.180 --> 02:54:01.640]
When it comes to entertaining, it's Neil Rogers midday.

[02:54:01.800 --> 02:54:02.580]
I love it.

[02:54:02.580 --> 02:54:03.700]
It's 430 on VICE.

[02:54:03.920 --> 02:54:06.300]
Till the UQAM, Miami, 4th Autoday.

[02:54:06.320 --> 02:54:08.420]
I'm flying the enjoy to Bush.
