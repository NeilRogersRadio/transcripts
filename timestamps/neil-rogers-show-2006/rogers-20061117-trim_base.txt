[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]
Friday you fasted

[00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.840]
Last night you dug a booger out from your old crusty nose

[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.380]
Oh, right, you wrote it between your fingers and that's when things got gross

[00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.800]
And I recall a horn you flung it down

[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.760]
You bounced off of table and splattered on the wall

[00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.640]
And you went through your nostrils and you found some things in there

[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.800]
Like that fair play takes gloves that I bought you to wear

[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.600]
And it was so disgusting what went on from there

[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.520]
Yeah, tonight you're sitting on just picking your nose

[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.240]
Quit picking your nose quit picking your nose

[00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:56.590]
Oh

[00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.670]
I told you to leave the hundred times that's gross

[00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:10.290]
Well, you just never listen girl you keep right on picking and I'll tell you once again quit picking your nose

[00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.390]
1015 60 WQ and it's Friday. Thank the Lord November 17. There's Ricky Tiki Sanchez on CNN

[00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.130]
Great, they got him in

[00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.370]
Regalwood North Carolina where they have the hurry King of the tornado whatever the hell was tornado and

[00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.310]
I think maybe CNN's hoping that there's an instant replay on the tornado and the blow is asked off on the ocean

[00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.010]
They're trying all kinds of ways to get rid of his ass. They can't do it. I know I sure is how what anyway

[00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.690]
Regalwood that's not anywhere near where you're joined is no well

[00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.630]
What a shame yeah, well getting a phenomenal response on our website today and the yesterday afternoon

[00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.670]
It couldn't be because of those naked pictures of Notre Dame quarterback Brady Quinn could it must be wow looks to me like he might be Jewish

[00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.050]
Anyway, just don't look too close. That's all and you know somebody I know who is gay

[00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.550]
Yeah, I know a few of those and I told him about your comments about

[00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.190]
Herelus guys and all this other crap and he said you are so full of it as usual. Yeah, of course stubborn and militant

[00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:13.550]
You know what are they just the expert on naked guys hairless and all guys shave their bodies because the women like it

[00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.750]
You know because if they're gonna get some action they got a shave

[00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.430]
They're thinking what is your gay friend know about that? I don't think that Brady Quinn has to shave anything you'd all the action

[00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.750]
He wants with anything that alive dead

[00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.830]
What I think your gay friend is full of crap and I know why?

[00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:37.410]
The whole world is full of crap George is the expert you name the topic right and I he'll tell you especially when it comes to sex no matter

[00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.430]
How many facts as we got backed up by every guy in the building? Yes, yeah

[00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.790]
Backed up by every guy that's sent that facts. What about it? That girls don't like hair these days. So well

[00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.830]
That's where it goes and anyway like I said

[00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.970]
Let's let's just not because they don't get in tune you just don't understand right you go ask some Twinkies and they say yeah

[00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.290]
Whatever you say man, I'm not interested in no Twinkies. How do you look at although it sounds good for lunch?

[00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.790]
Mm-hmm, that's nice. I see that's the kind of crap. I don't eat that's loaded with trans fats by the way. Oh, yeah

[00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.850]
Maybe that's why I'm so healthy Twinkies will kill you anyway

[00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.810]
Can I get back speaking to get and killed a group of security contractors including four Americans was abducted yesterday

[00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:26.510]
When a supply convoy was ambushed in southeastern Iraq a US military spokesman told CNN US troops are conducting a search another military

[00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.050]
Spokesman said the abduction occurred at checkpoint at a checkpoint like that checkpoint in fact do I have that thing still?

[00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.430]
Oh, yeah, I do have it good

[00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.770]
Okay, I'll give to that in a minute in fact

[00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.170]
Maybe you'll get abducted at the checkpoint by some police if you open your mouth

[00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.850]
Yeah on Friday today the US Embassy in Baghdad told CNN that five contractors believed to be kidnapped at it

[00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.710]
Everyone else has been accounted for but them the wheels of the military machine our emotion and investigation is ongoing

[00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.910]
The wheels of the military machine our emotion. We haven't had a fax a

[00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:01.370]
Telegram anything from anybody who's been a girl stream to the race you know yet. No, no, we have it playing them slots over there

[00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.750]
I saw a news report yesterday about what did it say they didn't they talked about how

[00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.570]
Big it was but then they didn't show anybody playing

[00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:14.830]
They just showed an empty casino. Yeah, they had a reporter there live outside of Gulf Street. No outside the casino

[00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.910]
They don't want us to see that the average age of the people inside was death plus 10

[00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.970]
But that's always been the way Gulf Street. You know, even when it was just horse racing

[00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.170]
You can't complain about the young people there because there aren't any now

[00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.250]
Maybe this is gonna change that maybe this will bring some of people under the age of 500 and they're all oh

[00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.930]
It's in Halendale. What do you expect?

[00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.710]
They're trying to make it like the hard rock

[00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.430]
I guess they were saying that there's like a club in there now and

[00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.490]
You know trying to get the young people to come out right?

[00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.310]
Well, maybe if we can get Gary Puckett the union gap back again for another concert that'll do it

[00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.250]
Here's yesterday's poll throughout American history which group has been treated the worst

[00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.070]
1600 and 30 votes Indians

[00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.390]
695 votes 10 little Indians who did that was that the power of hearing the Raiders now?

[00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:01.750]
It's no no, I don't know that children's son. 10 little in now. There was somebody done at a rock version of it 10 little engines

[00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:09.950]
I think it was default in Marvin Indian 695 votes blacks 563. We had a really good battle between the red folks and the black folks

[00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:15.330]
But the red folks won Jews 123 the only other group in triple digits 123 how about

[00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:23.910]
Sammy Davis's Indian cousin who gay 71 women 71 I hate this poll only 65 a mere 3.9 percent

[00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.810]
Mexicans 23 and Catholics 19 oh yeah, although William Downey who the Catholic League he would disagree with that

[00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.310]
He would put Catholics we have to talk. There's this anti Catholic like that. You know, he's he's a

[00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.130]
Crazy person is what he is just like all religious fanatics a crazy

[00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.070]
Person so I'm thinking that if we really want to get the tremendous action on our website again

[00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.290]
Not that we care, but if we did get back to put a lot of naked pictures on there again

[00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:53.250]
Because I mean easy and I already even naked pictures is nothing at all provocative about some seeing some jock

[00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.530]
With his shirt off. I mean what's the big deal with that right although he is you know

[00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.290]
He's not your everyday pedestrian jock Brady Quinn, but nevertheless

[00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.070]
No big deal with that. How about shirtless

[00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.410]
Female jocks all right

[00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.990]
Yeah, we need to get the beaded curtain back and I think there's a ray of wine. I'll weigh wound it if we have a

[00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.250]
25 plus you know what I mean

[00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:19.270]
That's the only thing they're concerned about that law that fascistic restrictive law is that you can't have any minors on there

[00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.470]
You have to have proof that they were at least 18 when the time they were taking the naked picture

[00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.030]
Mm-hmm. Well, I mean if we well, I don't know

[00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.750]
I don't want to go there because then Erica get all bent out of shape. Oh, you're gonna give me a trouble

[00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:35.490]
I'm gonna go to jail. Yeah, you'll have a good time in there all those trips to the Parliament House will pay off practice makes perfect

[00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:43.370]
Anyway, getting back to this thing with the BSO the Browards Sheriff's Office D. Y. Task Force will conduct saturation patrols this Saturday

[00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:50.250]
That's tomorrow night from 8.30 in the PM till 5.00 a.m. on Sunday morning in the following year is the North Lauderdale

Mm-hmm. It doesn't in North Lauderdale open park unincorporated central Broward impaired drivers will be identified

[00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.990]
D. Y. Laws will be actively in force

[00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:04.910]
You know you'd drunks off the road and if they just don't like the way you look her if you find out they voted for a

[00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.950]
Democratic candidate for any orifice they're gonna like drag your ass away

[00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:12.630]
It's just the way it is that's the American FN way. I think that law is still that's part of the Patriot Act part three

[00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:17.030]
Oh, there's Hank is on CNN again on the story we've been reporting all morning long

[00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.090]
Well, she is probably that Barbara star

[00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:23.750]
She is absolutely one of the grimest like and she hasn't got any makeup looks like she just crawled out of the sack

[00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:25.770]

967 votes already and our goal is only a thousand

[00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:32.690]
Hopefully because of course one of the are you looking at that?

[00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:38.330]
Look at what are the stars. Yeah, why would I do that? Well because she looks worse than ever

[00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.250]
I mean she looks like she looks sad

[00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.990]
She missed the makeup I'll call this morning and she just crawled out of the sack

[00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:49.070]
Maybe her cat died is that what it is? I don't know or something like that. I don't think she has

[00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:54.170]
She's crying which ultra rich person you despise the most we have 967 votes

[00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:58.450]
Rupert Murdoch for obvious reasons because he's a right wing piece of crap who's responsible not just

[00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:04.670]
For the New York Post all his other right wing pieces of garbage newspapers, but of course for Fox so-called news

[00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:10.430]
So everybody hates him like poison Rupert Murdoch 326. He's gotten agenda and evil doer if there ever was one

[00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:12.150]
I hate them all 137

[00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:15.330]
You know what I'm thinking about those people are said I hate them all probably slumpers

[00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:16.050]
Mm-hmm

[00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:19.210]
Like you people don't have two nickels to rub together. So they're just jealous

[00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:25.210]
Oprah 134. I'm so glad that she moved up into a strong second place nice going bitch Donald Trump

[00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:29.250]

Wayne Heisenga 111 and one thing he and Donald both year nice here George Steinbrenner 51 voice way on down to him small potatoes

[00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:43.610]

[00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:47.170]
Well if we to put Jimmy Buffett on there he'd done better than that, but we're not gonna do that

[00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:51.690]
Warren Buffett only five. Well, you know, he's so such a philanthropist him and Ted Turner

[00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:56.450]
985 votes on the pulled did we leave anybody off of that thing we could still add them on her now

[00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:01.190]
I don't think so actually that yesterday toward the end of the show and you couldn't come up with any other people

[00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:05.770]
You got all the important people are there well good. We like to leave no stone unturned

[00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:07.610]
Well, she looks bad too whoever the hell that is

[00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:13.590]
I must have had run out of a lipstick and mascara and makeup stuff like that. Well, she's in Baghdad

[00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:17.610]
They don't have any makeup over there. Oh, that's right. We don't want to have any women with makeup and Baghdad

[00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:22.070]
Not seen publicly since resigning from Congress and national scandal

[00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.690]
I bet she's got some nice makeup on mark fully

[00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:28.470]
Finally emerged yesterday in Palm Beach County after the death of his father

[00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:35.170]
The former congressman who left this post as a US representative in September after the disclosure that he had sent sexually explicit emails to

[00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:41.290]
Congressional pages is in town in West Palm for Ed Follies funeral Ed Follie 85.on Tuesday

[00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:47.750]
Follies emergence his coming out comes as the FDLE indicated that it shifted from a preliminary inquiry to a

[00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:49.670]
full-fledged criminal investigation

[00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:56.090]
regarding Miss Follie as the scandal unfolded more details were made public concerning Follies communications with teenage boys

[00:09:56.090 --> 00:10:00.810]
The US justice department and FDLE indicated that we're launching inquiries. They're launching it

[00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:03.450]
I bet you when he was sending those emails. He was launching it too

[00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:08.310]
We found that there might be criminal violations that would warrant a full investigation said FDLE spokeswoman

[00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:09.630]
Christina Persuela

[00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:14.070]
Pers Luja whatever name is adding that the agency also is assisting the FBI

[00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.890]
We don't know, but that's what we're gonna look into she said

[00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:22.090]
wearing a red polo shirt fully was seen with his attorney David Roth that the Palm Beach home of his friend

[00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:27.170]
Lane Nissenbaum on Thursday and later spent time at Roth's office according to channel five in Palm Beach

[00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:33.030]
Nissenbaum is a Palm Beach dermatology practice. Oh see that the dermatologist. He's probably getting like a scrub

[00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:39.570]
They're probably scrubbing it. It's unclear whether Follie will be at the the visitation today at Quattalbaum funeral home or tomorrow's funeral

[00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:41.930]
Mass at Miriamaculate Catholic Church

[00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:47.010]
His attorney David Roth is should reach statement yesterday on behalf of Follie in his family asking for privacy

[00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:49.290]
Roth couldn't be reached for comment beyond the press release

[00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:55.610]
Scott Andich funeral director at Quattalbaum funeral home acknowledged there may be speculation about Follies presence during the services

[00:10:55.610 --> 00:11:02.350]
This is about Ed Follie not about Mark Follie and hopefully that's how it stays on did said wonder if Andich's can do a mandate

[00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:06.470]
Think Follie recently underwent treatment for booze addiction in Arizona

[00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:12.270]
We have a soldier he previously announced to his attorneys that he is gay and that a priest molested him when he was just a teenager

[00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:16.110]
The priest Marcieca whatever his name is who said he thought he was enjoying it. He liked it

[00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.550]
He had a good time. He was smiling when it was going on

[00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:24.090]
All of that all of these things. I wonder what fervor and Ted thinks about this. You know Ted Haggard? Oh

[00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:30.070]
What he's thinking about that it's the devil the devil all the closet queens all the time baby

[00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:35.810]
All the geckys all the closet queens all the least miss Follie wasn't you know like some kind of religious nut like Reverend Ted

[00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:37.730]
He was just a sponsor of that

[00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:43.210]
Internet legislation about well, let's be sure we protect all the kids from perverts like me on the internet is what he was thinking

[00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:49.430]

What a crime don't you wear the Christian blood?

[00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:32.250]
Did it steal the pride of the jail?

[00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:37.310]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:39.490]
That day they came to watch us

[00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:45.570]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:53.210]
From your junk pony my pony

[00:12:56.010 --> 00:13:00.490]
For having too much fun with two bunch rolling

[00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:07.950]
Here's a shallot cross can't be far behind now

[00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:08.110]
Yeah

[00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:14.950]
We just a couple of more round the pounder

[00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:25.550]
Round the pounder and fly, on the fly, on the fly

[00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:29.890]
All you let me do is reput the key, it's a crime

[00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:33.110]
It's a crime, it's a crime, it's a crime

[00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:36.030]
What a crime don't you let me do it, it's a crime

[00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:40.790]
That's a crime, that's a crime

[00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:43.290]
That's a crime, that's a crime

[00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.550]
We just a couple more round the pounder

[00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:54.090]
You're fairer

[00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:55.590]
Let's look at that schedule if we have to

[00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:58.870]
Maddox is that Hooters and the Pines between Aaron Pompano excuse me

[00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:00.630]
Hooters and Pompano is that what I just said?

[00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:03.690]
Yes, two to four power hour with Hank and the Maddox four to five

[00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:05.570]
The Humper Solo between five and seven

[00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:09.010]
Then I'll guess who did the game on TV last night the Panther Game

[00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:10.070]
I'll give you one guess

[00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:14.130]
Goldie, Geldy, Geldy and Denise Potfan

[00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:15.970]
Boy, I talked about the blind leading the blind

[00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:18.030]
And the Panthers kicked that frog ass right there

[00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:19.370]
And the Aienta's center five to one

[00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:23.310]
Anyway Panthers inside it with Geldy from Doris Italian market at seven o'clock

[00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:27.310]
Followed in innocuously by the UM Evansville a basketball game

[00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:29.010]
The American Youth Classic at seven thirty

[00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:31.310]
And then it came from Vegas follows you in basketball

[00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:33.430]
Which is like following transmitter maintenance

[00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:35.230]
2014 votes

[00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:36.970]
We are off to the races now let me just

[00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:40.090]
I don't want to get into a big thing about this but we might have killed some good time

[00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:41.590]
About the internet screaming

[00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:44.410]
Now you're explaining to me before the show

[00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:48.770]
Which I still don't understand we increased the bandwidth so that it sounds so much better than ever did before

[00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:52.270]
Sounds really great and crystal queer and it's just a beautiful thing

[00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:55.490]
But we increased the bit rate too according to Eric

[00:14:55.910 --> 00:15:01.010]
Which makes it sound great if you can accommodate the more information that we're feeding out there

[00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:03.130]
But if you can tell your slumpers out the rules of the game

[00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:04.670]
So you're using dial up, get rid of it

[00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:09.030]
I can't imagine anybody using a dial up except maybe Larry King

[00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:13.330]
When he punches those little buttons he wants to make sure it has to punch him real slowly

[00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.450]
Because he's always got to keep one hand on his bag

[00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:16.730]
I still see those ads

[00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:20.710]
All kinds of companies offering dial up and you know I just laugh

[00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:21.990]
Like what's the point?

[00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:24.110]
I think the only advantage to dial up is it's real cheap

[00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:24.730]
Right?

[00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:25.590]
And you know what?

[00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:26.670]
And you get your money's worth too

[00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:31.570]
We got 773 friends at our Myspace page and Josh says that is really phenomenal

[00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:32.270]
Yes it is

[00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:34.290]
First of all compared to what's your name Nancy Grace?

[00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:37.390]
Nancy Grace doesn't have as many friends as she thinks she did

[00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:38.570]
That's surprising?

[00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:42.470]
Maybe that's why she's so anxious to befriend everybody she speaks to

[00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:43.030]
Friend?

[00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:44.670]
Because she don't have too many friends

[00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:46.990]
Which she have 400 and something on that Myspace page?

[00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:48.210]
Like 200 something

[00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:49.770]
No it wasn't, it was 400 and something

[00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:51.510]
No I don't think you have a memory like that

[00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:53.350]
I'm thinking it was like 279

[00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:54.530]
No, 449

[00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:54.930]
Fish

[00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:57.670]
Look it up again I'm telling you how I guess it's 449

[00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:58.410]
I'm going to befriend?

[00:15:58.650 --> 00:15:59.550]
I'm going 279

[00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:01.530]
449, okay let me write these down

[00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:03.930]
You say 279, I say 449

[00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:05.870]
The winner gets a gazillion dollars

[00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:08.450]
Gets his own slot machine to take home and dittle with

[00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.570]
Or gets a Brady Quinn to take home in dittle with

[00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:12.190]
And since I know you don't want that I'll take it

[00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:14.010]
So anyway look it up and let's see what she's got

[00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:15.330]
She's got nothing man

[00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:17.670]
Speaking of somebody who's got lots of nothing

[00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:20.110]
The Pope, you know the Pope with the fancy red shoes

[00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:22.010]
So anyway if we got any factions today

[00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:23.890]
From people bitching about the internet connection

[00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:24.950]
And it's all messed up

[00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:25.470]
Not yet

[00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:27.030]
So far

[00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:28.790]
If you're listening online we hope that it sounds

[00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:29.930]
Really sensational

[00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:31.730]
We hope it is fantastic

[00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:34.070]
And yeah you were right

[00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:35.230]
What how much is it?

[00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:35.910]
478

[00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:36.870]
Uh huh

[00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:39.430]
And that would be surprising it was 449 yesterday

[00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:40.630]
We looked it up because she's probably

[00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:42.790]
Gain in frames like crazy since we talked about it

[00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:43.630]
478

[00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:45.810]
That's a lot closer than 279 my guess

[00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:46.710]
But anyway

[00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:49.330]
Get that toilet paper roll out again for the other do not

[00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:52.830]
Yeah, let's do the whole show in it through the toilet paper roll

[00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:54.350]
And then the people online will say

[00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:56.970]
It sounds like you're talking through a toilet paper roll

[00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:58.330]
Like that fax on Wednesday

[00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:02.290]
Pope Benedict XVI believes Catholicism is growing sick

[00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:04.550]
And it's historic birthplace of Western Europe

[00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:07.950]
Where shortage of priests is both a symptom and an aggravating condition

[00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:10.190]
Of the choice of priestly celibacy

[00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:11.710]
Keep it in your pants

[00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:12.570]
That's the deal

[00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:14.850]
In normal circumstances

[00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:18.070]
Millingo's taste for the spotlight might cause the Vatican to simply ignore him

[00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:22.430]
But the fact that the Pope called the meeting in the first place is telling

[00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:24.870]
The question of specific dispensations

[00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:27.650]
And the border question of celibacy is not a matter of fixed church doctrine

[00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:29.890]
But as long as a tradition of Latin church

[00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:32.670]
While Eastern-right churches allow women to become priests

[00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:36.170]
Church insiders say that a small core progressive cardinals

[00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:39.810]
Have been trying to open up discussion of the rules going well back into John Paul's papacy

[00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:43.990]
Some observers even speak of the risk of a new schism with Millingo's departure

[00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:45.990]
I wonder if he was a Millingerer

[00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:49.050]
Though he is largely considered an unpredictable and isolated figure

[00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:50.650]
Who's lost much of his original following

[00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:56.630]
His becoming a de facto public spokesman for those opposing the centuries old church tradition of priestly celibacy however

[00:17:56.630 --> 00:18:02.850]
May have offered better that they unique opportunity to clearly stay this position on this hot button request early in his papacy

[00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:05.290]
As John Paul the toothed in his second year in Orifice

[00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:07.650]
That's where the Pope's likened in the Orifice

[00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:13.150]
Vatican sources note that there are several prominent cardinals who want to at least find two in the policy on celibacy

[00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:18.710]
They want to fine tune it like your radio dial. I don't think the Pope cares about Millingo said one senior Vatican official

[00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:23.290]
But he wants to give the cardinals a chance to have their say it's better to respond head on

[00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:29.310]
Applied directly to the brainstem

[00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:31.650]
Applied directly to the brainstem

[00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:33.850]
Applied directly to the brainstem

[00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:36.110]
I didn't know Shula was hooked on caffeine but nevertheless

[00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:40.630]
The plot of the art of African art's bishop soap opera which could be dubbed as Millingo turns

[00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:46.750]
Has been twisting for years a tent of viewers may remember that Millingo a tent of viewers of what what is this on since that time magazine

[00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:53.950]
May remember that Millingo who built a loyal international following for his passion in sermons and purported faith-healing prowess shocked the Catholic church in 2001

[00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:58.690]
By suddenly marrying a South Korean woman reverend sung my own moons unification church

[00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:03.690]
Millingo later passed things up with the Vatican which simply never recognizes marriage to his hand picked bride

[00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:07.630]
Who held a week's long sit-in protest in St Peter's Square demanding her husband back

[00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:11.790]
She was doing an angel song I want my husband back my husband's back

[00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:17.630]
Millingo later published a book in which he reprinted his mirrored of ours and was eventually placed in a backwater retaining diocese

[00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:21.250]
Where church officials could keep an eye on him but two months ago

[00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:27.070]
Millingo 76 burst back on the scene or dating four American married men as bishops and defines the Vatican

[00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:28.810]
It was automatically excommunicated

[00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:31.270]
It doesn't say whether they were married to women or elected to each other

[00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:36.710]
He says he doesn't recognize the excommunication and is organized a convention for more than a thousand married priests

[00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:42.590]
And their wives in New York December a through the 10th all right. Let's hear it for those married priests

[00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:48.190]
At least they're getting some of it. So you know legal as opposed to molested little altar boys

[00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:52.930]
Is now what the pope would like to do best altar boys? I think that's probably his number one hobby

[00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:57.410]
Imagine although the swish guard now I think they got to be legal. I know what the deal is with them

[00:19:57.410 --> 00:19:59.750]
They got to wear like a lot of heavy heavy clothing

[00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:03.670]
So the pope can't get at him real easy they can't just be hanging loose

[00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:11.350]
27 past 10 at 5 50 WQA me who would be a good swish guard is James Franco he looks like I got that look

[00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:19.530]
Picturing in in a parade don't they wear those little yeah funny. I think I think it would fit he's got that Franco American look

[00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:22.050]
I have a line for that but you're so give very upset

[00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:25.610]
A thousand 34 votes on a pool. It's not even 10 30 at man

[00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:29.750]
We are really kicking some big and that's because we got those naked pictures of Brady Quinn on there man

[00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:33.610]
That should really put us over the top if you're expecting guests this holiday season

[00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:37.870]
Then it's a great time to dial 1 800 mattress plus its dial macros is 30th

[00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:56.490]
You don't have to leave the house at all. Don't go to those bedding and department stores and get ripped off

[00:20:56.490 --> 00:21:02.670]
Wasting a lot of gas and time and money just call dial macros like I've done for years 1 800 mattress to get yourself factory direct prices

The biggest name of best talent this is real Rogers for radio 560

[00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:54.750]
QAM

[00:21:56.990 --> 00:22:02.890]
David's a bitch isn't it funny how some taste just take you back like when you were a teenager

[00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:08.670]
Remember sitting on your porch on a cool summer evening popping a zit with your fingers and then eating it

[00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:11.690]
Well the great taste is back at the Puzz ballast

[00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:20.730]
Yes delicious creamy soft serve puss in a cone or a dish with your choice of toppings all the great taste of your body you enjoyed as a kid

[00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:29.790]
Like warm ear wax, stab chips, and our new booger bits the Puzz ballast ice cream, you scream we all scream for Puzz

[00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:36.770]
Hmm as Miss Foley would say hmm 1032 a 560 WQ I'm happy Friday too

[00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:41.830]
Don't forget we got the big treat coming for a Josh and George a little bit later on love probably now

[00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:46.890]
I've got since ice cream is got their 50th anniversary and that big thing coming up tomorrow night which we'll tell you about

[00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:53.890]
And they bring in more tubs of ice cream and hot fudge and butter scotch and foot long weenies those national foot longs etc all of these

[00:22:53.890 --> 00:23:00.110]
Two tubs this time two tubs hmm okay don't forget what I recommended about the hot fudge in the butter scotch

[00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:03.810]
Take those little plastic containers new come for just a few seconds about 8 9 seconds

[00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:09.090]
And then just you got steaming hot hot fudge to pour over your rocky road or whatever all that

[00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:12.970]
Disgusting but today I'm good thing I'm not in the mood for ice cream I'll say to that yet

[00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:21.970]
This story is exactly what's wrong with the entire world this this is what just makes me want to get down on my hands and ease and puke my guts on the floor for hours and hours

[00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:25.610]
Putnam Connecticut I wonder if that's got anything to do with Joe Putnam

[00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:30.570]
The drives at Hazel Park occasionally and Indiana how about Carl Putnam Jr.

[00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:36.370]
Anyway two armed thugs tried to rob a line of people waiting to buy the new PlayStation 3 gaming console early today

[00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:40.690]
And shot one who refused to give up the money authority said should he give it up

[00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:46.610]
Two confended 15 to 20 people were in line outside a wall mart store shortly before a short after three this morning

[00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:50.610]
And demanded money said lieutenant jay Paul Vance I'm sure he's related to Dave Vance

[00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:55.070]
A spokesman for the state police the new Sony consoles are selling for around five to six hundred bucks

[00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:59.050]
One of the patrons resisted he kept his honor that was the guy that got shot

[00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:04.130]
Oh yeah it's true he kept his honor and he got shot

[00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:11.210]
He said the two gunman fled and the victim was taken the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester no immediate word on his condition

[00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:15.170]
Vance said police were searching for the suspects both believed to be in their teens

[00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:21.030]
He said one was wearing a ski mask and brandishing a handgun and the other head would appear to be a shot gun

[00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:25.650]
Kind of like the one that was used in that movie that we raved about match point where he like had the shotgun

[00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:29.670]
We're not going to tell you who he shot with it or if he did shoot anybody the radio huh

[00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:32.890]
At any rate no we don't want to ruin it

[00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:38.150]
Well look at this more fact more polls from Sean thank you Sean just in the nicotine man thank you so much

[00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:43.670]
In Palmdale California 30 shot down a super wall mart after some shoppers got a rowdy late Wednesday

[00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:50.970]
In West Bend Wisconsin a 19 year old man was injured when he went into a pool racing with 50 others for one of ten spots outside of Walmart

[00:24:50.970 --> 00:25:00.270]
He had a pool problem and Lexington Kentucky police were investigating a drive by shooting the hit for people with BB pellets outside a best by store causing minor injuries

[00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:06.250]
According to Kyt who's own reporter was hit as she interviewed buyers in line and at a best by in Boston

[00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:12.170]
Where it had only 140 the consoles they got smart its employees give out tickets to the first 140 people lines

[00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:17.070]
Everybody could go home and come back later and buy it in more civilized circumstances

[00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:22.530]
And then the smart way to do it absolutely Jackson's is here by the way Jackson's is here with the ice cream

[00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:27.470]
Thanks God man. Thank God that I'm not there because boy my blood sugar would go skyrocketing

[00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:30.230]
That probably croak right on here with a big smile on my face though

[00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:35.430]
Now let's see what Sean says before I look at his pulls here and this day and eight some intimate grooming is appropriate

[00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:38.730]
But I'm not so sure about the total bikini shaving so common among girls

[00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:43.570]
Unless you're a biker a guy doesn't want to bed down a girl with a body here like a haziner

[00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:48.730]
But I don't want to feel like I'm a listening a campfire girl either it's okay for guys to trim a bit to avoid the chroma

[00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:50.710]
Then look you don't want to be like that pissed off caveman

[00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:57.770]
But shaving even worse leaving a landing strip is mega gay I would agree with that absolutely see Sean knows what he's talking about

[00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:06.370]
Absolutely what let me say let me say it again I would say at least 50% maybe majority of young guys like say under 25 are

[00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:12.590]
Heralis and don't they're not shaving their chest they're not shaving their armpits and not shaming if they're shaving their crop sets a different story

[00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:21.010]
That's a lazy thing. Let me ask you what is your your gay friend know about what straight guys are doing as James Carville continues his crusade to

[00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:30.450]
Wastowardin is DNC chair DCCC chair Ram Emmanuel wants to consolidate according sources in the DNC and the DCCCCC

[00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:35.470]
Emmanuel called Dean this morning who distance himself from the tone and general tenor of Carville's comments

[00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:41.230]
That's yesterday and a short conversation in manual acknowledge that he shared some of Carville's opinions about the DNC's priorities

[00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:46.350]
But said he did not share Carville's wish that Dean ought to be out to this DNC chair and by the way

[00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:50.370]
Guess who's going to be the speaker? I don't know what day it's coming because I don't pay attention to stupid Canadian politics

[00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:54.230]
Guess who's going to be the speaker at the liberal party convention here Canada?

[00:26:55.850 --> 00:27:00.390]
Baba no I guess me hit I'll give you a audio clue

[00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:07.110]
Oh, how we the impossible manual on election item the two out of friendly conversation court of sources affiliated with both men

[00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:12.110]
When the when their schedules permit Dean and Emmanuel meet privately to discuss their plans for the 2008 cycle

[00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:18.410]
Both sides hope to reach in advance and understanding about how the democratic party committees will fund state parties and candidate committees

[00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:23.430]
After the private meeting the two will likely take their rapprochement public. Oh, there's another stupid French word

[00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:29.170]
Meanwhile current DNC member X DNC chair down Fowler emailed members of the DNC his response to Carville

[00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:33.790]
He said some ill advised voices have suggested that because of his 50 state strategy governor

[00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:41.970]
Dean should be replaced to chair the DNC he wrote in the email. This is nonsense. He said the 50 state strategy exactly with the democratic party need and continues to need

[00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:48.850]
Nice going Don. They don't come no Fowler than Don but he's got his thumb right on it. You go boy. So how's the ice cream and the weenies and stuff?

[00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:52.690]
It's good and cold. It's just ice cream. Oh no we need. Oh, no we got.

[00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:57.590]
It's a little bit early in the day to be thinking about weenies. So although I'm worried about it because I got a whole tub of ice cream over here.

[00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:03.810]
I'm going to take a look at those pictures again on our website just to make sure the Brady Quenneed shavon is chat. I'm just Tonya.

[00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:08.650]
You can just tell when a guy is one of those ordinarily hairless people. That's him. I'm just Tonya right now.

[00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:16.610]
Okay. I can usually nine out of 10 times tell by looking at a guy's face. I would say it because like you mentioned yesterday when you're person.

[00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:26.310]
Can I finish or I can usually tell by looking at a guy whether he's got hair on his chest or not. The only exception would have been of course your ultra hairy and he made up for a lot of, you know, your buddy won Pablo.

[00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:40.530]
Well, you were talking about the the stubble which is very obvious. But you know when you're looking at pictures, you know, you know what they do with pictures. They retouch and I'm trying to write now Brady Quenne is as smooth and silky as a hangman's ass.

[00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:48.590]
I don't want to get in the way of your fantasy. Well, whatever. And what difference does it make? Okay. Why do you care? That's what I'm so concerned about.

[00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:58.630]
I've got all been out of trouble. So hung up about what are this guy shaving his nine. You are. I could give a point. I just happened to notice on the picture that looked like he shaved his pubes. It was a quimmy here. That's what you got.

[00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:04.170]
A little bit gay, unusual to me. And then of course you guys were both tell me about all upset when I implied that he probably uses.

[00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:11.410]
There. And do I care if he uses me apparently do on his pair. 1068 votes on the pool.

[00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:18.950]
Hmm. Is what we got. What do you got there? What do you want? Straight up chocolate? I think straight up chocolate with some hot fudge on it. I got some American.

[00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:27.110]
I'm putting more some ice and put that. Fudge in a microwave and nuke it for a few seconds. My way right here. Who know? Yeah. And I'm telling you. That's the way to go.

[00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:37.410]
Oh, we all hot hot. Fudge. Listen to me. Just lethal it right on there on your chocolate. And what are you eating in there Josh? I got the same. I'm going chocolate. No.

[00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:47.910]
1068 votes on the pool. Which ultra rich person dude despise the most whether or not they near their chest. Rupert Murdoch. 353. I hate them all 150.

[00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:59.590]
Oprah 142. How much is she's neat? Not. Oh, yeah. We saw us coming out of her. Well anyway. He's probably going to talk Donald Trump. 132 Wayne hyzing a 123. I can't believe Wayne ain't doing better than that.

[00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:10.550]
I hate this pool only 55.6% five and a half percent whatever it is George Steinbrenner only 55. He's small taters man. Ted Turner 31 Bill Gates 18 and Warren Buffett.

[00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:20.370]
He's still got only five. So lamentate. Chinkway. So Tonto. Chink. But whatever the hell. See when you start mixing the Spanish and Italian is very non linguistic. It's bad. Bad to be doing it.

[00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:31.470]
Oh, here's another lifter to us. But at least he wasn't standing in front of pin. This weekend you people out there that just desperate to see a really neat flick that you haven't seen before go out to your video store and get pin and also get match point.

[00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:47.330]
I think match points a lot better but nevertheless yes it is better ready better. Yeah, I would go ahead to the queue to. If you heard from Leon. I miss him. Yeah, that's good. He's sitting in the window and it's oh, I don't want to run the ending for you.

[00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:50.650]
The biggest name. This is like. This is.

[00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:53.050]
For 60.

[00:30:55.610 --> 00:31:00.290]
This is G Gordon Lydia and they don't come anywhere. The Neil Roger.

[00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:12.710]
It is the interview everyone is talking about the question Anna has never answered until now Anna are you going to vote?

[00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:19.830]
Oh, yes. How you going to vote on Proposition 87 or answer will surprise you. Well, I didn't think about that.

[00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:25.930]
It is the interview moment. That is almost too difficult to why. Okay, then how you going to vote on Proposition 86?

[00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:34.130]
I know nothing about nothing. It is gripping painful. Do you know the difference between Proposition H and preparation age?

[00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:41.410]
I want to say my clothes off. It is dramatic footage. Are you a Democrat, a Republican or a Sagittarius with Mercury rising?

[00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:43.510]
I'm trying to listen to the air.

[00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:51.570]
She's doing it. Let me tell you 1047 13 to 11 at 560 WQ AM joined Kim Bo camp for today.

[00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:58.190]
Noon to one big tall boring Kim. He's a good guy. Noon to one at the David Charhart located at 9000 West

[00:31:58.190 --> 00:32:05.110]
Day Road 84 stopped by to spend the QM wheel for those really no budget prizes and helped celebrate Charhart's 30th.

[00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:05.670]
Absolutely.

[00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:11.770]
So Jackson's and Danias having their 50th anniversary in Charhart their 30th.

[00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:15.830]
Not exciting? That's exciting and I think I might go from sober.

[00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:19.870]
You might go to wear the Charhart? No to Jackson's. Oh, you mean tomorrow?

[00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:20.430]
Yeah.

[00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:24.210]
Oh, do I still have that promo for their big thing tomorrow night?

[00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:27.930]
I don't want to send it again. No, I don't want to. Oh, you mean tomorrow? Yeah.

[00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:31.710]
Oh, do I still have that promo for their big thing tomorrow night?

[00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:34.590]
No, I don't want to. Send it again. No, I don't. Maybe I don't have to.

[00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:36.570]
Don't we have a spot for that today? I'm sure we have a spot.

[00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:41.450]
One moment, please. Let me check my log. I'm looking at my log and I'm in tears.

[00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:45.410]
Yeah, you did. I know precisely where it is.

[00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:50.970]
Here's a real surprise. Not Republicans today chose representative John Bainer succeeding fat ass speaker.

[00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:56.250]
Denny Hasdard and the top GOP lead position over the Democratic control house that convenes in January.

[00:32:56.250 --> 00:33:02.330]
Bainer defeated Indiana conservative Mike Pence. Bainer's election cement his resurrection within GOP leadership ranks

[00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:08.290]
and his elevation is the party's front line leader came despite unrest after a spirited campaign by Pence.

[00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:12.790]
Bainer succeeds, of course, Tom DeLay, the anxious Tom DeLay, who's out.

[00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:18.890]
Thousand ninety four votes on the pool will easy have over 1100 by 11, 11 by 11.

[00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:24.990]
And the response on that website is just unbelievable. That's because we got a lot of fruit cakes out there.

[00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:28.870]
A couple of women too. I beg your pardon? You don't think the women are checking that out too?

[00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:31.330]
We don't have any women. Oh, yeah, that's right.

[00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:34.730]
We don't have any women. We got like maybe 40, 50 women listen to this show.

[00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:38.010]
We don't have to be on this station. You just keep forgetting about it.

[00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:43.530]
You're right. In fact, I noticed there in that very last segment of the morning show after we switched over and forced me to

[00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:48.970]
I mean, I was able to listen and Kenny said it's 9.58 and then he said a sports time.

[00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:51.730]
Is that he'd like to keep forgot about it? But he wanted to make sure that he got there.

[00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:55.770]
They've got a gun to his head man. He's under tremendous pressure. You can bet your life on it.

[00:33:56.230 --> 00:34:02.710]
And then that's why I'll be honest with you. That's the only reason that I had the Josh put those pictures of Brady Quinn up there because he's a quarterback for Notre Dame.

[00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:05.770]
It's a sports thing. It's got nothing to do with the fact that he's naked and looks so hot.

[00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:09.130]
That's not got nothing to do with it. Oh, our straight male audience out there.

[00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:11.870]
They didn't want to hear about some hot looking young guy to play his quarterback for Notre Dame.

[00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:16.090]
But it's a sports thing. And the fact that the sports fanatics are all like that.

[00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:19.730]
You know, am I right? Isn't it a sports thing? You answer that Josh?

[00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:20.810]
Yeah, why not?

[00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:22.550]
Depends on what kind of sport you're into.

[00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:27.330]
U.S. President George, he's busy trimming now. Don't get that here in the ice cream, man. That's gross.

[00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:29.270]
Oh, no, not again.

[00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:42.690]
U.S. President George Bush was informed this week of an initiative to establish a center under his name in Israel as a sign of gratitude for his support for the country and its security for being so far-bicin.

[00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:45.730]
Outgoing Israeli ambassador to the U.S. Daniel Alon.

[00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:53.750]
What if he's kind of Frankie Avalon asked Bush for the go ahead with establish such a center during a farewell meeting with the president and his deputy Dick Cheney.

[00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:57.650]
Bush told I align the freedom to be a worthy subject for the center to focus on one moment.

[00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:59.070]
Freeze. I'll be back in 10 seconds.

[00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:03.670]
That was a bit important.

[00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:06.210]
Scared me. I dropped my spoon.

[00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:20.210]
They were all shaving our chest while we're on a year here.

[00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:22.750]
I'm doing two words with one stone.

[00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:30.150]
I align as yet to approach donors with a request to finance the establishment of the Bush Center in Israel, the Bush Center.

[00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:36.610]
But does not expect to encounter difficulties when it comes to raising the funds.

[00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:41.510]
The outgoing ambassador will continue to work on the matter with White House chief of staff Josh Bolton.

[00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:49.850]
Meanwhile, I align who leaves the diplomatic service in a number of days left Washington on Tuesday and flew out to the West Coast, where he's participating in a number of events before he turned into Israel.

[00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:55.350]
But they're probably giving him lots more cluster bombs and nukes and stuff and saying, go get him.

[00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:56.950]
Before it's too late.

[00:35:57.850 --> 00:36:01.090]
Oh no. Anna Carolina Reston. She's a model.

[00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:02.830]
She was a model in Rio.

[00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:09.890]
The mother of a Brazilian fashion model who died from complications of anorexia has made an emotional appeal for parents to take better care of aspiring young models.

[00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:14.470]
Anna Carolina Reston. She worked abroad and did some jobs for the Brazilian model agency.

[00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:16.190]
Le Kipe. I worked abroad.

[00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:18.270]
They keep. Didn't work out though.

[00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:24.110]
The death of Anna Carolina Reston, 21, follows growing criticism of the use of underweight models in the fashion world.

[00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:28.830]
And it should give a new significance after the death in August of Uruguayan model.

[00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:33.630]
Luis Sal Aramos of heart failure during a fashion show in Montevideo. See, heart failure.

[00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:35.950]
Their hearts are going out. It's like a caring carpenter deal.

[00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:46.910]
Reston died Tuesday in Seattle, hospital from a generalized infection caused by anorexia, and needing disorder in which sufferers obsessively deprive themselves of food in pursuit of the ultra slim look.

[00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:53.930]
The pencil look. A walking pencil man. Reston weighed only 88 pounds. It was about 5 foot 8 inches tall.

[00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:59.330]
Doctors considered the normal weight for, that to be a normal weight for a 12-year-old girl no more than about 5 feet tall.

[00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:02.130]
Take care of your children. Nobody's worth a life of your child.

[00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:05.990]
Not even the most famous fashion brand is worth it. Her mother, Miriam Reston, told,

[00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:10.530]
Oh, global newspaper. She said her daughter had been trying to help the family with money she made as a model.

[00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:14.090]
Miriam spoke on national TV into a local newspaper to highlight the tragedy.

[00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:19.550]
She said she had pleaded with her daughter to eat more. See a doctor. Have a sandwich. Go get some beef, or be in bean burritos.

[00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:25.050]
Come with me to Taco Bell. She would reply, Mommy don't mess me around. Miriam told us daughter to say,

[00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:26.130]
Pao, sell Paolo.

[00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:30.210]
That's the end of that story. She's dead. Honey like that. Eat.

[00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:33.430]
Man, jamangia man. Real. And of course, eat too much and you're going to die too.

[00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:37.190]
That's the kind of God you got, man. Very, very sadistic bastard.

[00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:41.770]
1106 on our pool. By the way, 1106. There's not a lot of point reading the Resulver.

[00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:45.670]
Often because obviously, Rupert Murdoch's got it licked, especially with our crowd.

[00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:50.510]
We hate him like poison. Although I voted for Wayne just because I went in a few left out.

[00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:55.650]
I know he was up against some stiff competition. Right. I know that you've parked Mark.

[00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:58.790]
I beg your pardon. The Donald. Even though I knew that Rupert is the more evil one.

[00:37:58.790 --> 00:38:00.770]
And you know, that's what everyone was going to look for.

[00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:06.890]
A nice, airtight Donald. Yeah. Anyway, getting back to this OJ thing,

[00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:09.650]
which I don't want to spend much time on it. Don't hear the air's the deal.

[00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:12.850]
Don't buy the book and definitely don't watch the Fox thing. Right.

[00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:18.170]
Judith Regan, publisher of OJ Simpson's stupid ass book, if I did it.

[00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:22.650]
She says she didn't pay him for the rights to publish his book in which the one-time football superstar

[00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:25.730]
tells how he would have killed his ex wife. If in fact, he had done it.

[00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:29.690]
This is the most stupid pile of crap. And again, like Fred Goldman keeps saying,

[00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:33.390]
because they got him under every five minutes, just another slap in everybody's face is what it is.

[00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:40.350]
What I do know is I didn't pay him. Regan said in the statement published exclusively last night on the Fudge Report.

[00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:44.550]
Fudge? Is that Fudge? Yeah. I contracted to a third party.

[00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:49.350]
And did you want Nukhli to have Fudge or what? Nukhli had Fudge and I ported on my chocolate to get it chocolatey or.

[00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:52.050]
Am I right? I'm a past out here in a minute. Good.

[00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:56.810]
I contracted to a third party, he owns the rights and I was told the money would go to his children.

[00:38:56.810 --> 00:38:59.750]
And that much I could live with, she said. His children who, of course, by the way,

[00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:03.510]
are going to be watching this thing on Fox and reading the book and everybody will be saying,

[00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:06.430]
Hey, your daddy killed those people, kids. They know.

[00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:11.230]
Your slime all daddy. The book that he'll reportedly was sold a Harvard Council for three and a half million dollars.

[00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:18.470]
The producer of a TV special Fox plans to wear a conjunction with the book confirmed that Regan Stamu was authentic and since he was publishing it only on the Fudge Report,

[00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:20.830]
it would not provide copies to other media outlets.

[00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:23.970]
She's in bed with Miss Fudge, not for long though.

[00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:30.990]
Regan said in the statement that she knew from my own experience that Simpson would be found not guilty murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown and a friend around Goldman.

[00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:38.270]
Regan said that she knew Simpson would be acquitted because she, her self, had once been accused by a boy friend who manipulated Lied and broke her heart.

[00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:41.790]
And then, after all, but leaving me dead in the hospital, he left for good, she said.

[00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:49.170]
Regan said, I made the decision to publish this book and it's it face to face with the killer because I wanted him and the men who broke my heart in your hearts to tell the truth

[00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:52.190]
and confess their sins and to do penance and to amend their lives.

[00:39:52.350 --> 00:39:58.850]
Oh yeah, Simpson was acquitted of the murder. We know that but I'm even a bit of a bit of a bump and all he was ordered to pay an estimate of 30 or five million dollars in damages.

[00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:11.070]
He's never paid a penny and never willed with the goldmins with the browns or anybody else because he's a slime ball and a low life and a piece of crap who was admired and year-speared by some of the people who used to work and still work on this radio station.

[00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:13.010]
And we apologize for that profusely.

[00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:17.850]
And again, even though it's years later, we apologize for the fact that he was invited to show up at our charity golf tournament.

[00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:23.570]
See, that should have been the turning point right then and there. If I had if I had any balls, if I had any brains, it would have been a lawsuit.

[00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:33.130]
I should have sued him for about 80 million. I should have taken a rash right to the cleaners. Greg Reed and Scruan and the bees lesion this whole bunch and the water Nazi, these jockstrap sniffing lunatics.

[00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:40.410]
The biggest name of the best talent is the O'Rodgers, sports radio 560s UAM.

[00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:44.270]
This is the O'Rodgers show.

[00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:47.070]
This is the brain.

[00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:50.010]
Any questions?

[00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:54.290]
No. Some stations give you cash. Some stations give you cash.

[00:40:54.510 --> 00:41:00.170]
But this station is going to give you more because this station is going to give you a total human experience.

[00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:03.370]
That's right. We're going to change your sex.

[00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:05.970]
You're sex.

[00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:07.830]
How the other half of you did?

[00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:11.650]
Discover just why you were so lousy and bad.

[00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:13.650]
Guys, look what it's like to ask for directions.

[00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:15.990]
Girls, you would like to be a jerk.

[00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:21.030]
And when you hear this sound, you was a call and we'll change your sex.

[00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:23.210]
You're sex.

[00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:31.010]
Winners of the sex change receive an all expense pay trip to Sweden where highly skilled surgeons will rip out the genitals, stop them in a plastic bag and shove them in some new ones.

[00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:33.290]
Winners may keep their old genitals as a free gift.

[00:41:33.730 --> 00:41:38.450]
Employees of this station are not eligible to have their genitals ripped out free of charge but must do so with their own expense.

[00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:41.810]
You know you want to change your sex.

[00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:42.950]
People just think to win.

[00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:46.030]
I don't know two at 560. I was speaking of Swedish, whatever.

[00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:46.710]
Yes.

[00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:50.950]
There's another category where you admitted yesterday like Asian young men and who else Indians.

[00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:51.570]
Indian right.

[00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:53.110]
And Latinos many of them.

[00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:55.250]
And what about Scandinavians?

[00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:57.770]
They hairy, pretty men in Scandinavia.

[00:41:58.170 --> 00:42:00.290]
No, the very fair have little hair.

[00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:01.730]
Fair hair.

[00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:02.730]
You're fair.

[00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:02.830]

[00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:06.850]
Oh no.

[00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:09.270]
1122 votes on our poll today.

[00:42:09.850 --> 00:42:11.850]
It's almost as popular as those Brady Quinn pictures.

[00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:14.130]
I'm sure that every Aquian in America is looking at those.

[00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:15.390]
They're all over the internet.

[00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:21.170]
And of course that's bad that I found that stuff because you punch a couple little buttons and then you find all these naked people on there.

[00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:22.190]
And what I'm saying there.

[00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:22.590]
Uh huh.

[00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:24.890]
That just, I still can't get over that.

[00:42:24.970 --> 00:42:26.730]
There's some things that just bug me to the point.

[00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:30.370]
It's like that thing about somewhere there's a murderer out there on the loose.

[00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:33.250]
He was joking, wasn't it?

[00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:34.390]
That was all a big joke.

[00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:35.110]
Let's pretend it was.

[00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:36.750]
No, I don't mean the murder was a joke.

[00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:39.730]
It was a tragedy like anybody else, but just, uh, wow.

[00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:41.730]
Well, we are sports intensive.

[00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:44.190]
And if anybody in sports gets like a hang nail or something like that,

[00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:47.590]
we get really indignant and pissed off about it here on QAM and across the street.

[00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:52.870]
I'm sure we get really upset and bent out of shape and cry like little women, like little ladies.

[00:42:53.550 --> 00:42:55.970]
Doug Thompson, your buddy on CapitolTillBlue.com.

[00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:59.610]
He's not too enchanted speaking to little ladies with Nancy Pelosi and rightfully so.

[00:42:59.790 --> 00:42:59.970]
Right.

[00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.610]
I don't like her either.

[00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:06.270]
Pelosi and the Democrats, the lady and her tramps, he writes today in his rant on CapitolTillBlue.com.

[00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:13.430]
He says after watching incoming speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's Gidey Gidey, Katie Couricstow performance before the cameras Thursday,

[00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:16.490]
I had a wonder is this Bimbo, Bimbo ready for prime time?

[00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:21.090]
After being elected the first female speaker in history of the Old Boys Club called the House of Representatives,

[00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:27.030]
Pelosi who promised quick unflinching reform in the Congressional cesspool, urged her colleagues to elect as her number two,

[00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:30.850]
the ethics challenged lobbyist pandering pork bloated John Murtha.

[00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:34.070]
The Democrats quickly put the little lady in her place and elected and said,

[00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:36.750]
Maryland Congressman Steny Hoyer, the vote wasn't even close.

[00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:42.030]
Keep in mind that Hoyer is no saint, like Murtha, he never made a lobbyist whose money he wouldn't take,

[00:43:42.330 --> 00:43:45.190]
and he sold his vote more than once, but at least he didn't give video tape,

[00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:50.590]
telling undercover FBI's imposing as a sleazy con man, that maybe we can do business once we get to know him.

[00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:55.010]
Despite all their promises of reform, Democrats seem to be well on their way to a business as usual,

[00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:59.830]
way of doing things, Hoyer won because he cashed in favors, the standard way of getting things done in Congress.

[00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:04.030]
Murtha lost the majority leader's job, but Pelosi re-worded him with a key subcommittee chairmanship,

[00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:08.090]
where he can keep cashing in on this context with fat cat defense industry lobbyists.

[00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:11.250]
Then the new lady of the House paraded before the TV cameras and said,

[00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:12.470]
let the healing begin.

[00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:16.150]
What's next? Try out Rodney Keynes, A. Camp, we all just learned to get along?

[00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:20.270]
Over on the other side of the Hill Senate Republicans proved they haven't learned a damn thing from the election either,

[00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:23.790]
the electing corrupt, Rob Taken, Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell is their new leader,

[00:44:24.130 --> 00:44:28.150]
and installing in a one vote, squeaker, racist Trent Lot, as is number two.

[00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:32.830]
Lot, whose razor-thin victory is being held, is the comeback of the year by immediate that gave far more attention

[00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:41.010]
to the lot of side to vote against Murtha, lost his job as Senate leader a few years back for appraising the overtly racist presidential campaign of former Senator Strom Thurman.

[00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:47.270]
Lost immediately, a lot immediately received calls and congratulations from fellow racist George W. Bush Dick Cheney

[00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:49.190]
and White House chief of staff Josh Bolton.

[00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:53.350]
Perhaps lots of sentient back to powers pay back for the minorities voting Democratic this time,

[00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:57.770]
I can imagine the conversation between W and Lot, well-trend old boy glad to have you back.

[00:44:58.130 --> 00:45:00.150]
Now we had those darkies and wet backs on the run.

[00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:02.330]
McConnell, of course, is no beacon of light.

[00:45:02.610 --> 00:45:09.290]
Heat torpedo campaign reform openly promised a political action committee bosses that he would protect them as long as they keep writing out checks to the Republican Party.

[00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:13.470]
Those same bribe paying lobbyists had best remember that the last time Republicans were in the minority,

[00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:18.230]
McConnell was on the floor of the Senate calling for elimination of PACs because they dared to give money to Democrats.

[00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:21.490]
McConnell would pinp out one of his daughters for a campaign contribution.

[00:45:21.970 --> 00:45:28.270]
What we see here is clear indication that in spite of all the hoop law with the Democratic sweep of the House and Senate last week's elections, nothing really changes.

[00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:29.310]
Isn't that what I said yesterday?

[00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:30.490]
Just said.

[00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:31.090]
No.

[00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:33.970]
I didn't expect the Republicans to change their stripes.

[00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:41.590]
He says the party elephant is so corrupt, so overridden with slime that they, of course, turn to the same crooks, sleaze bags and con artists who control the destiny for years.

[00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:47.830]
And while I held out faint hope that Pelosi might prove me wrong, she fell back into the old congressional habit of putting party loyalty above ethics.

[00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:56.510]
First of Porter's claim, she owed Martha because it was his early opposition to the war in Iraq that helped put the issue in the nation's psyche and generate the voter anger that delivered the Democratic victory.

[00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:59.530]
And I've heard all the rationalizations about Martha's unethical behavior.

[00:45:59.810 --> 00:46:00.830]
It happened a long time ago.

[00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:03.010]
It was never charged with taking a bribe and so on.

[00:46:03.370 --> 00:46:07.530]
Martha has a long proven history of selling his vote and using the power of his office to benefit family and friends.

[00:46:08.590 --> 00:46:14.430]
Realizations of his actions normally come from partisan political pukes who would never ever accept such behavior by the other side.

[00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:17.070]
Pelosi's actions tell me that nothing will change in the house.

[00:46:17.290 --> 00:46:23.410]
Nor can we expect any real change in the Senate where new Majority Leader Harry Reid's checkered past is record of shady real estate deals.

[00:46:23.650 --> 00:46:26.630]
Show control of the body that is once again in criminal hands.

[00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:28.490]
The mafia has a saying for this.

[00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:30.490]
New boss, same as the old boss.

[00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:34.470]
Never knew that the mafia had that saying to you.

[00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:36.770]
I didn't know it came from the mafia, but I heard that before.

[00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:39.310]
In other words, what are you going to do?

[00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:40.510]
Nice college boy.

[00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:42.790]
They want to get mixed up in the family business.

[00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:45.910]
Now you want to go down a police cap and want to slap you in a face a little bit.

[00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:47.170]
What do you think this is?

[00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:48.550]
The army where you shoot them a mile away?

[00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:49.950]
You got to get up close like this.

[00:46:50.090 --> 00:46:52.450]
But a big, your blood brain's all over your nice cyberleaks suit.

[00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:53.290]
Come here.

[00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:55.330]
You're taking a sparey person.

[00:46:57.790 --> 00:46:59.370]
Oh god, I can't stand it.

[00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:01.090]
It's 11 away to 560 W.

[00:47:01.210 --> 00:47:02.890]
We got 1138 votes in a pool.

[00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:04.070]
We're going to have a stay.

[00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:06.390]
We're going to have some staggering number in there by 2 o'clock.

[00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:09.470]
I don't know what it should be, but whatever it's going to be, it'll be staggering.

[00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:10.370]
I'm going to be staggering.

[00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:13.570]
And you're going to be staggering because of all that ice cream and all that stuff you're eating.

[00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:13.970]
You know what?

[00:47:14.050 --> 00:47:15.270]
This time I'm going to finish this tub.

[00:47:15.830 --> 00:47:16.470]
Oh god.

[00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:17.630]
Just out of spite.

[00:47:18.070 --> 00:47:18.230]
Right.

[00:47:18.310 --> 00:47:19.190]
Because I can't have any.

[00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:21.790]
I poured hot fudge on it and I'm going to finish it.

[00:47:21.830 --> 00:47:23.470]
Oh, there are always them going.

[00:47:23.650 --> 00:47:25.370]
I'm checking out those pictures again on their website.

[00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:31.770]
Don't forget to join Kimba Bo camper, new to one at the Navy Charod, 9000 West A-RuDee 4.

[00:47:31.770 --> 00:47:35.370]
Spin the wheel and if you win, you get some of the crappiest QM prizes you ever got in your life.

[00:47:35.370 --> 00:47:36.830]
That's not why you're going there.

[00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:37.350]
No, it's true.

[00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:38.010]
We're embarrassing.

[00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:43.430]
You're going over to say Kimba and it helps to celebrate Charod's 30th anniversary and to grab you some really good lunch.

[00:47:43.450 --> 00:47:45.230]
Which you will be paying for, of course, but nevertheless.

[00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:51.950]
The U.S. government promised that Americans will never be hungry again, but they may experience, wait till you hear this, very low food security.

[00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:52.630]
Huh?

[00:47:53.130 --> 00:47:55.170]
No more hunger, low food security.

[00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:59.470]
Every year, the agriculture department is just a report that measures Americans access to food.

[00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:03.270]
And it's consistently used the word hunger to describe those who can least afford to put food on the table.

[00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:04.670]
But not this year, no more.

[00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:12.810]
Mark Nor, the lead author of the reports at Hungary, is not a scientifically accurate term for the specific phenomenon being measured in the food security survey.

[00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:17.830]
Nor, the agriculture department's sociologist said, we don't have a measure of that condition.

[00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:23.690]
The department said 12% of Americans, 35 million people couldn't put food on the table at least part of last year.

[00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:28.450]
11 million, this is why you're sitting there shoveling tubs of ice cream down your fat, disgusting puss.

[00:48:28.450 --> 00:48:29.710]
Why my fault, man?

[00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:38.630]
11 million, then, before they're going hungry at times, beginning this year, the agriculture department has determined very low food security to be more scientifically palatable description for that group.

[00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:42.610]
Less embarrassing, you know, if you say there's millions of hungry Americans, it's a...

[00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:46.690]
But if you say there's hundreds of millions of people who got low food security, it's like, what's that?

[00:48:47.350 --> 00:48:54.690]
The U.S. has said a goal of reducing the proportion of food insecure households to 6% or less by 2010 or half the 95 level, but it's proved difficult.

[00:48:54.690 --> 00:49:02.750]
Number of hungry Americans has risen over the past five years, and last year, the sure of food insecure households stood at 11% food insecure households.

[00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:05.750]
Less fexing has been the attempt to fix the way Hungry's described.

[00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:19.710]
Three years ago, the department asked the Committee on National Statistics of the National Academies to ensure that the measurement method U.S.D. uses to assess households' access or lack of access to adequate food, and the language used to describe those conditions are conceptually sound and operationally sound.

[00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:25.090]
In other words, if you got a dumpster in the back of the house where you can go and pick off somebody else's garbage, then maybe you're not really hungry.

[00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:28.210]
That's right, or not hungry at all. Or maybe too hungry.

[00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:42.810]
Among several recommendations, the panel suggests that the agriculture department's scrapped the word hunger, which should be furtherway potential consequence of food insecurity, that because of prolonged involuntary lack of food results in discomfort, illness, weakness, or pain, that goes beyond the usual uneasy sensation.

[00:49:43.170 --> 00:49:44.130]
Or maybe in other words...

[00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:47.950]
Yes, death. That's another side-effective unusual hunger. It's death.

[00:49:48.830 --> 00:49:53.370]
Hunger is purely an important issue, nor it's said lacking a widespread consensus on what the word hunger should refer to.

[00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:58.170]
It's difficult for research to shed meaningful light on it, and of course, all depending on what you're hungry for, you know what I'm saying?

[00:49:58.810 --> 00:49:58.990]
Food?

[00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:02.270]
Yeah, that could be one of it. Or like Miss Foley would say.

[00:50:02.310 --> 00:50:04.510]
Or sometimes you're hungry for a little something else.

[00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:07.930]
The biggest name of best talents to this system.

[00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:09.410]
You want a more prominent number and more sound?

[00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:11.850]
Or radio 560, UAM.

[00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:16.150]
Excuse me, but I do believe that sounds bad.

[00:50:17.570 --> 00:50:26.070]
Hello, brains. I am the Reverend Ted Haggard, former president of the National Association of Evangelicals.

[00:50:26.330 --> 00:50:37.270]
I have taken early retirement from that fine organization to pursue another colon, not a higher colon, really more of a lower colon, much, much lower.

[00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:46.250]
And even though president Bush won't return my calls anymore, and I've been kicked out of my church, I found a new home, a new home on television net.

[00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:52.650]
But getting that Sunday, the Bravo Network will premiere my series, Queer Eye on the preacher guy.

[00:50:54.090 --> 00:50:58.250]
Oh, the premiere episode. My special guest will be Neil Patrick Harris.

[00:50:58.250 --> 00:51:02.610]
It wasn't he cute when he was that little dude in Halzair MD.

[00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:09.950]
Neil and I would discuss several important topics, including when is a massage, more than a massage.

[00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:17.950]
To them who say evil man, but really how did those boxer shorts and will reveal the new play I can see there?

[00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:25.730]
Yeah, man, in the sports segment of my show, will open play in the Reverend Ted Haggard Cornhole tournament.

[00:51:26.370 --> 00:51:31.190]
That's Queer Eye on the preacher guy with me, the Reverend Ted Haggard.

[00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:37.450]
Someday is a unravo, it'll be so much fun. You'll think you just snorted mev with a male escort.

[00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:44.550]
Oh, and speaking of that, you know, I would have a little bit more respect for Reverend Ted and Miss Foley if at least they had good taste, which neither one of them does.

[00:51:44.550 --> 00:51:48.550]
You know what I'm saying? What do you say? I'm saying that their taste is in their tush.

[00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:53.030]
Nevertheless, wait until you hear this story, boy, talk about getting caught with your Walmart down.

[00:51:53.770 --> 00:51:58.890]
My wife Elizabeth wanted to get a PlayStation 3 from my young children, John Edward, said almost your vice president.

[00:51:59.470 --> 00:52:04.570]
She mentioned it in front of one of my staff people. The staff person mentioned it in front of a volunteer who said he would make an effort to get one.

[00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:07.310]
He was making an effort to get one for himself, Edward said.

[00:52:07.310 --> 00:52:13.290]
Elizabeth and I knew nothing about this. He feels terrible about this. He made a mistake and knows he should have not used my name, Edward said.

[00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:21.190]
Walmart had noted a news release yesterday that on the same day, Edward was criticizing the company in a conference call with union-backed activist.

[00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:27.910]
The volunteer staff member had asked a Rolling North Carolina electronics department manager to obtain a PS3 for the Accentators family.

[00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:34.530]
Earlier Thursday, Edward said, in a statement emailed by spokeswoman Kim Ruby, we instructed no one to contact Walmart on our behalf.

[00:52:34.530 --> 00:52:44.290]
From Walmart headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, company spokesman David Tovar said the Edward staff member left a voicemail at the Rolling Store and identified himself as an Edward staff member.

[00:52:44.730 --> 00:52:50.750]
When the manager returned the call to staff member again, identified himself as working with Edward's and Walmart said it confirmed it with the Edward's office.

[00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:55.030]
The retailer issued a written statement yesterday accusing Edward's of not wanting to wait his turn.

[00:52:56.030 --> 00:53:03.710]
Oh, man. While the rest of America's working families are waiting patiently in line,

[00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:07.090]
Senator Edwards wants to cut to the front of Walmart statement said,

[00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:14.590]
this summer, Walmart hired Edelman Executive Leslie Dash as its public relations director and put him on the company's executive team.

[00:53:14.970 --> 00:53:17.890]
Ain't less predicted the retailer would likely become more aggressive toward its critics.

[00:53:18.770 --> 00:53:30.010]
Edwards and Democrats of VP candidate in 2004 spoke Wednesday to supporters of union-backed wakeupwaltmart.com on a conference call launching the Group Solid-A season campaign to pressure Walmart for better labor standards.

[00:53:30.010 --> 00:53:34.650]
In the call, we repeated a story about a son jacked disapproving of a classmate buying sneakers at Walmart.

[00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:38.270]
If a 60-year-old can figure it out, America can definitely figure this out.

[00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:41.710]
Edwards said previously, Edwards has appeared at wakeup Walmart rallies.

[00:53:42.350 --> 00:53:46.390]
Edwards said the volunteer was a young kid unaware of what he called flawed Walmart policies.

[00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:50.170]
He called the Walmart statement effort to divert attention from its own problems.

[00:53:53.130 --> 00:53:54.750]
I want my PlayStation 3.

[00:53:56.070 --> 00:53:59.770]
I got news for him. He could have gotten it there for his kid. He would have kissed their ass.

[00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:03.990]
All the Walmart employees could have lined up. He would have kissed each and every cheek five times.

[00:54:04.970 --> 00:54:05.330]
Am I right?

[00:54:05.450 --> 00:54:05.690]
Probably.

[00:54:06.550 --> 00:54:08.710]
What's I got to do with I just finished off my tub of ice cream?

[00:54:09.110 --> 00:54:10.090]
I thought you were going to have another one.

[00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:11.510]
Oh, good not right now.

[00:54:12.130 --> 00:54:13.630]
Well, pace yourself. That's where I wait ten minutes.

[00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:15.870]
Wait ten minutes. Right. I mean, my brain's frozen for Christ's sake.

[00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:23.190]
If you know who I'm really, really, I and you guys are going to disagree because you think she's at, like, you know, I am so sick and tear to Angelina Jolie.

[00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:24.910]
What is the big simous with her?

[00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:26.650]
We've discussed that same thing here recently.

[00:54:27.010 --> 00:54:31.570]
She can hold a candle to Scarlett Johansson or even a Brady Quinn as far as being pretty.

[00:54:32.290 --> 00:54:37.950]
I think she's still attractive, but she's been skived out and her antics are not very attractive.

[00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:40.790]
She's been shaved out probably.

[00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:44.490]
Well, that's the pits.

[00:54:45.530 --> 00:54:55.710]
Indian police detained three of Angelina Jolie's bodyguards in New Delhi Friday after parents complained the men had mishandled and abused them and their children during a shoot of the Hollywood stars latest film.

[00:54:56.110 --> 00:55:03.570]
Police said British bodyguards have been taken into custody after receiving complaints about an incident in a Mumbai Islamic school where Jolie was filming a mighty heart.

[00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:11.090]
Angry parents had said the guards had threatened them and called their bloody, called them bloody Indians when they tried to get into the school to collect their children on Thursday.

[00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:12.030]
How do you like that?

[00:55:12.250 --> 00:55:12.790]
Bloody Indians.

[00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:18.390]
The film crew admitted that there had been some confusion at the school as the guards tried to keep the paparazzi out.

[00:55:18.890 --> 00:55:25.510]
We have arrested three people there in jail now and we've produced in court Bar-Bar-Jesh Singh, Mumbai's Deputy Commissioner of Police Soldroiders.

[00:55:25.770 --> 00:55:26.990]
He didn't give a date for a court hearing.

[00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:38.330]
Jolie had been in India for almost a month shooting on teaming streets and crowded trains for the film which is based on the kidnapping and murder of American journalist Daniel Puril in 2002 in Pakistan by a hardline Islamist militants.

[00:55:38.590 --> 00:55:42.350]
The Salthri actress is portraying Puril's wife, Murri Mirian.

[00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:45.550]
What's that song? Come back, Murri Ann by Terry Gillison.

[00:55:45.830 --> 00:55:47.810]
Am I right about that? Boy, if I can remember that.

[00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:51.170]
Come on, Murri Ann. Come back, Murri Ann. Go to hell, Murri Ann. What was that?

[00:55:51.850 --> 00:55:55.070]
All day, all night, Murri Ann. Wasn't it the Kingston trio? I don't know.

[00:55:55.070 --> 00:55:56.250]
I think you're right.

[00:55:57.010 --> 00:56:08.610]
Jolie, accompanied by her children and partner Brad Pitt, who was also the film's producer and their children, has sparked a media frenzy and the film set off in the Tract Huge Crowds, prompting the bodyguards to step in.

[00:56:10.270 --> 00:56:17.750]
Even those people, even those engines over there, are like just nauseous from, you know, the tongues hanging out of their knees.

[00:56:19.790 --> 00:56:21.090]
Exangilina, it's Brangilina.

[00:56:21.450 --> 00:56:23.030]
The whole world is sick with this crap.

[00:56:23.370 --> 00:56:24.430]
Sick. Real sick.

[00:56:25.070 --> 00:56:28.190]
Ugling and ogling over something that they're never going to have, they're not going to get it.

[00:56:28.330 --> 00:56:29.870]
And like, look at that picture on our website.

[00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:32.970]
What's the point? He ain't coming over here. Just for fun.

[00:56:33.410 --> 00:56:36.550]
Love it on that side. Just for fun and just aggravate a lot of straight people. That's why I do it.

[00:56:37.210 --> 00:56:40.310]
Love it on the 61 and it works like a charm. I'm sure. Oh, there he goes again.

[00:56:41.330 --> 00:56:47.730]
Too bad. Now maybe some of you are beginning to understand how some of his fags feel about having always to hear about the straight guys in their car.

[00:56:47.730 --> 00:56:52.010]
Their con question is hot chicken. Fine. Great. Have a good time. Just I don't want to hear about it.

[00:56:52.290 --> 00:56:56.750]
You know, payback is a bitch. Oh, it's speaking of that gay penguin bookshakes up Illinois school.

[00:56:56.930 --> 00:57:00.050]
Oh, no, not another one of those gay stories. Yeah, Shiloh Illinois.

[00:57:00.330 --> 00:57:04.750]
Yeah, more of this homosexual agenda. That's right. Rubbing it in, so to speak. Rubbing it in deep.

[00:57:04.930 --> 00:57:08.350]
That's what Ms. Foley says. When a doubt rub it out or whip it out.

[00:57:08.810 --> 00:57:17.710]
A picture book about two male penguins raising a baby penguin is getting a chilly reception among some parents who worry about the books availability of children and the reluctance of school administrators to restore the school.

[00:57:17.710 --> 00:57:22.650]
That's a strict access to it. Huh. The concerns are the latest involving and tango makes three.

[00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:30.830]
The illustrated children's book based on a true story of two male penguins in New York City's Central Park Zoo that adopted a fertilized egg and raised the chickens their own.

[00:57:31.390 --> 00:57:41.310]
Complaining about the books homosexual undertone, some parents of shadow elementary school students believe the book available to be checked out of the school's library in this 11,000 resident town 20 miles east of St. Louis.

[00:57:41.310 --> 00:57:48.250]
Tackles topics their children are ready to handle like homosexual penguins. I wonder what Burgess Meredith would think about this.

[00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:53.770]
They're they're requests move the book to the library's regular shelves and restricted to a section for mature issues.

[00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:59.490]
Perhaps even requiring parental permission before a child can check a parental permission to be checked out.

[00:57:59.890 --> 00:58:05.250]
The district's attorney said moving it might be construed a censorship. Oh, we don't want to do that. Do we in America? Yes.

[00:58:05.250 --> 00:58:05.470]
Yes.

[00:58:06.730 --> 00:58:13.410]
Failure considers the book adorable and age appropriate written for kids ages for Pinto thought the book looked charming when her five year old daughter bought it home in September.

[00:58:13.810 --> 00:58:17.150]
They'll Pinto. I wonder if she's keen to what's his name? What's his name?

[00:58:18.610 --> 00:58:24.290]
Domenico Mardunio. They'll blew the Pinto the view of the blue remember that? No. Volada. Anyway, forget about it.

[00:58:24.290 --> 00:58:29.370]
They'll Pinto said she was halfway through see I do these because only chicken echo know what I'm talking about. So he and I get a chuckle out.

[00:58:29.850 --> 00:58:36.750]
They'll Pinto said she was halfway through meeting into a daughter when the zookeeper said the two penguins must be in love. That's what I ended the story she said.

[00:58:36.890 --> 00:58:42.330]
Oh, how ridiculous. Two male penguins being in love. Let me be like two men being in love. Do I ever heard of such a thing? No.

[00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:49.490]
They'll Pinto said her daughter's teacher. In fact, that's probably why I'm wrong most guys get along better with their mother than with their father because you don't want to love another man. That's bad.

[00:58:49.490 --> 00:58:54.830]
Del Pinto said her daughter's teacher told her she was unfamiliar with the book in the school's librarian directed her mother to Fidio.

[00:58:55.030 --> 00:59:00.890]
I wasn't alarmed with pitch force. I wasn't armed with pitch force. I was instantly was seeking answers. Del Pinto said agreeing with Fidio.

[00:59:00.890 --> 00:59:06.050]
I was believed that pulling the book from the shelves could constitute censorship. The book is created similar flaps elsewhere.

[00:59:06.210 --> 00:59:13.610]
And courses that would penguins do they flap earlier this year. Two parents voice concerns about the book with librarians at the rolling hills consolidated libraries.

[00:59:13.610 --> 00:59:27.370]
They knew a branch in the Northwest Missouri town of Savannah. Barbara Reed rolling hills director said she'd consultant with staff members at the Omaha, Nebraska and Kansas City zoos and the University of Oklahoma zoology department who told her adoptions are unusual in the world of penguins.

[00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:34.670]
They'd like to like to adopt an egg and then they cook it up for a lunch. She said the book was then moved to the non friction section because it was based on actual events.

[00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:40.790]
And that section she said there was less of a chance to book with blind side somebody in the friction section.

[00:59:43.070 --> 00:59:52.150]
Oh my god. This is what people are worried about. This is the kind of stuff that the get's keys are worried about. Oh brother, I'm so glad that we can cause so much angst and grief and tourists.

[00:59:53.250 --> 01:00:01.770]
1165 votes out 1176. Wow, they're coming in in chunks now in big oozing chunks. What the hell is going on here now? Oh must be a big Thanksgiving rush.

[01:00:01.770 --> 01:00:06.910]
That must be it because you know what's it gets to be Thanksgiving from then to laughter New Year's. We might as well be talking to ourselves.

[01:00:06.930 --> 01:00:15.790]
You don't understand that I'm so relieved to hear that the dolphins play on Thanksgiving day. The lions. That's right. You do realize that they could actually beat the Vikings this week because the Vikings are girls team.

[01:00:15.890 --> 01:00:23.550]
The Patriots pounded the facility week ago Monday night and they suck and then Detroit. I mean, it's another little girls team that make the Vikings look like super bowl contenders.

[01:00:23.550 --> 01:00:34.250]
So the dolphins could wind up putting for in a row and everybody say look at this. We're on the way to the Super Bowl. Yeah, well, can't you hear it now? Yeah, can't you just hear it? I can not only hear it. I can smell it.

[01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:40.950]
The biggest names of best talents to this is Neil Rogers. Forged radio 560. You a.

[01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:44.850]
It's Friday. You.

[01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:45.590]
Best.

[01:00:46.270 --> 01:00:47.130]
It's just.

[01:00:49.310 --> 01:00:50.750]
Oh, you.

[01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:52.430]
You.

[01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:52.630]

[01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:54.650]
Are you.

[01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:56.870]
Well, it's just.

[01:00:58.190 --> 01:00:59.330]
You want.

[01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.730]
Yeah, it's.

[01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:02.970]
You should be the star of the West.

[01:01:03.830 --> 01:01:06.430]
Now we're making movies about the true.

[01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:14.450]
The.

[01:01:23.290 --> 01:01:24.650]
The.

[01:01:24.850 --> 01:01:24.850]

[01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:24.890]

[01:01:25.050 --> 01:01:25.050]

[01:01:25.110 --> 01:01:25.110]

[01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:30.110]
The.

[01:01:35.250 --> 01:01:35.250]

[01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:36.410]

[01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:39.970]
The.

[01:01:39.970 --> 01:01:41.390]
The.

[01:01:41.410 --> 01:01:42.710]
The.

[01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.710]

[01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:49.750]
The.

[01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:52.190]
The.

[01:02:02.730 --> 01:02:03.950]
The.

[01:02:12.730 --> 01:02:15.210]
Tiger Young as you have mrebbe active heroes out there and it's so fun somewhere in this area.

[01:02:15.210 --> 01:02:27.250]
Dig a bout in a lot of competitions.

[01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:32.370]
And balls up to his butt.

[01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:33.930]
And

[01:02:33.930 --> 01:02:37.310]
court. I don't know. And you're going to have two courts. It's a half a gallon of ice cream

[01:02:37.310 --> 01:02:42.250]
you'll lunatic. More than a plate. Boy, you're going to be spending a lot of time, a lot of

[01:02:42.250 --> 01:02:48.490]
busy reading time this weekend on the throne. Speaking of Tristan and his old. Anyway, maybe Josh

[01:02:48.490 --> 01:02:52.230]
knows. Hey, you don't know. You don't want to know the his step brother. Remember, he was adopted

[01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:56.890]
in the movie or in the early part of the movie? No, I don't remember. George, remember how he was

[01:02:56.890 --> 01:03:01.130]
a you saw that part of the movie. Right. I did. And that kid was his step brother and he grew up

[01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:05.350]
together in that family. And he looked like his twin brother put naked pictures of guys on our

[01:03:05.350 --> 01:03:10.370]
website the last 24 hours. Yeah, that's it. I mean, I'd be more than happy to put more naked chicks

[01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:13.930]
on there. But you know, you're going to have to be responsible for it and go into jail. You'll have

[01:03:13.930 --> 01:03:18.330]
a good time in there. Well, here's more PlayStation 3 crap. Aren't you a little bit tired of this crap?

[01:03:18.750 --> 01:03:24.290]
No. A lot of demand, two few supplies is the Harold. And I've seen that experts predicted would play out

[01:03:24.290 --> 01:03:29.530]
across the nation. There were only 34 PlayStation 3 consoles available at Best Buy in Dataland when the

[01:03:29.530 --> 01:03:34.510]
store is doors open at eight o'clock this morning. Only 34. But over 100 people, mostly in their

[01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:38.450]
late teens and early 20s, they can't forget it on the sidewalk outside the store for as long

[01:03:38.450 --> 01:03:42.850]
as six days. I wonder if Larry King was there waiting for his. And the less than 10 minutes, all 34

[01:03:42.850 --> 01:03:47.690]
PlayStation were sold for five to 600 bucks. The new PlayStation's, we only have to wait a

[01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:51.970]
way there heavy consoles and talk to plans to shower and sleep. Less lucky customers left

[01:03:51.970 --> 01:03:56.550]
tired and ejected. Extra employees were hired to work early as well as extra security to ensure

[01:03:56.550 --> 01:04:01.010]
the process would go smoothly. People in line received numbered tickets. Only 10 people were allowed

[01:04:01.010 --> 01:04:04.770]
to the store at the time when the door was open. That's a good early way to do it. Instead of allowing

[01:04:04.770 --> 01:04:09.970]
all these lunatics to go forcing their way in there and knocking each other over. One young man walked

[01:04:09.970 --> 01:04:14.830]
out and resold his PlayStation for two grand to a man who was planning on selling it for more on eBay

[01:04:14.830 --> 01:04:21.150]
where bids were creeping over three grand. Over 400,000 PlayStation 3 is available in the USA. Best

[01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:24.910]
Buy employees attempt to clean up the debris left by people in line. But there was a bit of an obstacle.

[01:04:24.910 --> 01:04:32.890]
Three people were already in line for Nintendo's Wii console. Let's see. What is this? What is this?

[01:04:33.290 --> 01:04:37.410]
That mean get him excited. I mean, refers to chicken neck ice. No.

[01:04:38.730 --> 01:04:43.810]
What was the doubt? All this old stuff. Nobody wants to look. Plunk your magic twang or froggy.

[01:04:44.110 --> 01:04:50.230]
Indy divine and the buster brown show. I remember that by sure. Don't remember no dog. 1199 on the pool. 1199.

[01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:55.450]
We're going to be let me refresh it. I bet you we got 1200. I'll bet you anything. I'll bet you that next quarter ice

[01:04:55.450 --> 01:05:01.670]
cream. 1199 on the pool. 1199. We're going to be let me refresh it. I bet you we got 1200. I'll bet you

[01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:07.110]
anything. I'll bet you that next quarter ice cream. It's still 1199. So I lost. See, it's good. The

[01:05:07.110 --> 01:05:12.350]
Lord is looking over me. He's looking out for me 1199 votes still. Isn't that something? I wouldn't

[01:05:12.350 --> 01:05:16.910]
you think any other time you'd refresh it. It would be like to act in 1947. Opponents fear the move could

[01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:21.970]
help find a resurgence of nationalism. Like I just said, teachers should foster love of the nation

[01:05:21.970 --> 01:05:27.030]
and homeland. The fatherland. They are worried because Japan's military leaders use patriotism to

[01:05:27.030 --> 01:05:31.870]
justify the expansionism which led to WW2. The bill calls on teachers to instill thinking

[01:05:31.870 --> 01:05:36.590]
among students respecting tradition and culture and loving the nation and homeland. The fatherland.

[01:05:37.110 --> 01:05:42.270]
Japan's new prime minister Shinzo Abbey, Abee, whatever his name is, Abee, Elincon, has strongly

[01:05:42.270 --> 01:05:46.530]
backed the bill. In a weekly email, he said Japan's education system is not sufficiently addressed

[01:05:46.530 --> 01:05:51.650]
ideas such as moral values, ethics, and self-discipline and self-abuse. He also mentioned a recent

[01:05:51.650 --> 01:05:56.470]
spate of bullying incidents which he said would lead parents concerned the education system need reform.

[01:05:57.210 --> 01:06:00.910]
Conservative groups of long-rugged for a revision of the current law saying people should learn

[01:06:00.910 --> 01:06:05.050]
national pride as Japan assumes a more active diplomatic and military rule on the international

[01:06:05.050 --> 01:06:09.710]
stage. The bill passed after the opposition boycott of the vote and now goes to the upper house

[01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:13.690]
where the government hopes to win approval before the current parliamentary decision ends on

[01:06:13.690 --> 01:06:18.930]
December 15. According to the BBC's Tokyo Correspondent Chris Hogg, Japan has become a lot less

[01:06:18.930 --> 01:06:23.030]
cautious about patriotism than it used to be. Seven years ago a piece of music that honors the emperor

[01:06:23.030 --> 01:06:26.950]
became the national anthem and the rising sunflower became the emblem of the Japanese state.

[01:06:27.470 --> 01:06:31.110]
And I was just about everybody in Asia is turning Japanese. But the government would argue that

[01:06:31.110 --> 01:06:35.010]
the country's passive has constitution is preeminent and that no one has anything to fear for

[01:06:35.010 --> 01:06:41.590]
me more patriotic Japan. Right. Nobody has anything to fear. From anybody, everybody's like

[01:06:41.590 --> 01:06:46.150]
peace loving and no. Twelve oh five on the pole thank god boy it would have been bad if it would have

[01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:52.390]
got stuff there 1199 and I would have started losing. See I'm doing that just to show a little

[01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:56.850]
empathy for you guys. To share the love we appreciate it. Well because you're just shoving down

[01:06:56.850 --> 01:07:01.850]
just gobs and gobs in that Jackson's ice cream. That one's ruining you. Are you really? Oh yeah.

[01:07:01.850 --> 01:07:06.910]
Might be the day the woman brought the the rug lock in remember that. Oh yeah. Just covered

[01:07:06.910 --> 01:07:11.570]
with powdered sugar and I'm going to tell you I was so sick I I would wish I had my thing there

[01:07:11.570 --> 01:07:15.410]
so I could have prick my finger and taken my blood sugar. I bet it was like over 500. You would

[01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:18.630]
have broke the machine. That's like the woman that kept bringing the smarties to the hockey games.

[01:07:18.730 --> 01:07:22.510]
I kept on her don't bring me any candy. I don't want you to understand I'm diabetic. I'm going

[01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:26.610]
to get sick as hell and she'd bring him into me and I would do oh gee I don't want these and she

[01:07:26.610 --> 01:07:29.830]
would insist I take him. And of course I would eat him because I had them. Hey when you were

[01:07:29.830 --> 01:07:33.250]
addicted is something if you got it in your hand you'll eat it. They should just brought you

[01:07:33.250 --> 01:07:38.450]
crack cocaine. Might as well. That had more control over that. It brings me these things as

[01:07:38.450 --> 01:07:42.030]
smarties at the hockey game. Thank God I'm not there to go to the game so people bring me all that

[01:07:42.030 --> 01:07:46.650]
food like you like your accountant brought me that damn stuff that time that diet hall of

[01:07:46.650 --> 01:07:51.150]
odd. Do you remember that? Mm-hmm. Man I was I was on the throne. I felt like a king Manaquin.

[01:07:51.590 --> 01:07:57.050]
Good God. What was his name David? David the farbissen who brought in the sisses in the

[01:07:57.050 --> 01:08:00.530]
area. Right. To fill in that day and practically killed you right on the ear and that was good.

[01:08:00.790 --> 01:08:04.550]
Yeah he wrapped it to fill in around Georgia's arm and talk about purple veins right.

[01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:08.610]
My God. Now I know why they don't. Yeah they're rocking back and forth because their circulation

[01:08:08.610 --> 01:08:13.750]
is gone because they can't breathe they're falling over and then just like that in the

[01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:17.470]
finish. Good guy David he's probably listening right now. Well hubbum in the

[01:08:17.470 --> 01:08:22.210]
budget. I've all of them in what a name. The best challenge for this is wheel roger.

[01:08:22.510 --> 01:08:25.190]
It's 4th radio 560s UAM.

[01:08:27.250 --> 01:08:29.930]

[01:10:23.290 --> 01:10:26.590]
My religion's better than your religion.

[01:10:27.050 --> 01:10:29.210]

No man, I'm saving that. I'm just taking some home.

[01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:51.310]
I'm going to take it home. That's a good idea.

[01:10:51.410 --> 01:10:55.130]
That's a settled idea. Then you can pass out on the floor at home instead of pass down the floor right there.

[01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:57.010]
Like Josh's predecessor.

[01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:58.870]

Bookers assigned clients a secret code attract their wages monitor points breads and results to a restricted website.

[01:13:47.290 --> 01:13:53.850]

[01:15:01.090 --> 01:15:02.830]

You ain't seen nothing yet.

Wait till we turn loose some of our talk, our sports nerd people.

[01:15:17.570 --> 01:15:21.070]
Look at that. Dutch government poses ban on waiting, burp wearing, burkas in public.

[01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:24.190]
Critics say the Berkaban would amount to religious discrimination.

[01:15:24.650 --> 01:15:27.110]
You go, you Dutch, you crazy bastards. You go.

[01:15:27.670 --> 01:15:28.570]
Berkaban my ass.

[01:15:29.110 --> 01:15:30.430]
Yeah, that's a good idea in your case.

[01:15:30.970 --> 01:15:31.470]
What a joke.

[01:15:32.530 --> 01:15:36.250]
Dutch government poses ban on wearing Berkaban public. That's one of the best ideas.

[01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:37.950]
Yeah. Freak and great.

[01:15:39.250 --> 01:15:43.110]
A US soldier who ripped a 14-year-old Iraqi girl helped a killer family

[01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:47.250]
has been sentenced to life in prison with possible parole, with possible parole.

[01:15:48.190 --> 01:15:54.130]
Specialist James Barker was one of four serving soldiers charged over the killings in the Iraqi town of Mu'madea, which happened in March.

[01:15:54.530 --> 01:15:57.430]
He put in a guilty and agreed to help prosecutors in an effort to avoid the death penalty.

[01:15:57.850 --> 01:16:00.270]
He could serve up to 90 years in prison the presiding judge said.

[01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:02.470]
Yeah, he could serve up to 90 years of my ass.

[01:16:02.670 --> 01:16:04.850]
Why, why do they always say such stupid things?

[01:16:05.190 --> 01:16:05.850]
Could they do that?

[01:16:05.850 --> 01:16:09.410]
He could serve up to 500 years in prison. You know, if he lived that long, but...

[01:16:09.410 --> 01:16:14.870]
This court sentence is you to be confined for the life of your natural life with the eligibility of parole to 10-a-coron-rich or 10-a-denterson sent.

[01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:17.390]
He's expected to be eligible for a parole in 20 years.

[01:16:18.090 --> 01:16:22.250]

[01:16:22.730 --> 01:16:28.970]
The three other sergeant Paul Cortez, private Jesse Spielman and private Brian Howard are facing court martial proceedings.

[01:16:29.410 --> 01:16:35.030]
A fifth man, former soldier Steven Green, has been charged in a civilian court in Kentucky with murder and sexual assault.

[01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:40.270]
He's denied the charges. Before the judgment was handed down on Thursday yesterday, James Barker was told...

[01:16:40.270 --> 01:16:43.130]
He told the court that Mr. Green had come up with the plan for the rape and the killings.

[01:16:43.450 --> 01:16:46.510]
Mr. Green, he brought it up to me and asked what I thought about it.

[01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:50.870]
It's like when Bush talks about the evil derives and says these folks, you know, these folks.

[01:16:51.390 --> 01:16:52.650]
Same thing with Mr. Green.

[01:16:52.810 --> 01:16:53.970]
All the folks he...

[01:16:53.970 --> 01:16:59.490]
By the time we started changing clothes, it was more or less a non-verbal agreement that we were going to go along with what we were discussing, Barker said.

[01:16:59.490 --> 01:17:05.830]
He also confessed that he hated Iraqis telling the judge they can smile at you, then shoot you in your face without even thinking about it.

[01:17:06.290 --> 01:17:10.110]
But he had of that Iraq had made him angry and mean, yet that he regretted his actions.

[01:17:10.270 --> 01:17:12.730]
Something the court didn't set up to kill or deliberately harm people in Iraq.

[01:17:13.210 --> 01:17:16.590]
He said, I want the people of Iraq to know that I didn't go there to do the terrible things that I did.

[01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:19.710]
I don't ask anyone to forgive me today and we don't.

[01:17:19.710 --> 01:17:20.590]
You butcher, you murderer.

[01:17:21.010 --> 01:17:28.670]
Somewhere in this town, on the loose, military prosecutors didn't come after the judgment was passed because the three other soldiers still faced Cortez Marshall.

[01:17:29.290 --> 01:17:30.370]
Get that right now.

[01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:31.230]
Cortez Marshall.

[01:17:32.930 --> 01:17:35.230]
See, George is... he's fine with that. He likes that.

[01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:37.530]
I don't like the way it sounds either, but that's...

[01:17:37.530 --> 01:17:38.110]
I don't like it.

[01:17:38.350 --> 01:17:38.870]
It's correct.

[01:17:39.210 --> 01:17:40.290]
They face court marshals.

[01:17:40.750 --> 01:17:41.050]
Who's?

[01:17:41.450 --> 01:17:42.430]
Like in marshals, Michigan.

[01:17:42.850 --> 01:17:44.810]
Let's go to win shoulders for lunch and get some of that bar cheese.

[01:17:45.150 --> 01:17:47.190]
Oh, that's right. You probably don't have a big appetite right now.

[01:17:47.530 --> 01:17:47.810]
No.

[01:17:48.450 --> 01:17:52.070]
I still keep thinking about that turkey dinner these days where you can get seconds for free.

[01:17:52.530 --> 01:17:54.010]
Turkey and stuffing and...

[01:17:54.010 --> 01:17:55.190]
Mmm, and veggie tables.

[01:17:55.610 --> 01:17:56.630]
Yeah, that's why I am whatever.

[01:17:56.630 --> 01:18:00.410]
A long time ago, 1965, Marshall, Michigan, WMRR.

[01:18:00.710 --> 01:18:00.910]
Wow.

[01:18:01.930 --> 01:18:07.750]
Followed by WSTR in Sturgis, Michigan in 1966, I was the Marco Polo of a tiny market radio for a while there.

[01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:10.910]
And then, of course, made the big time in Kalamazoo at WTPS.

[01:18:11.150 --> 01:18:12.730]
That was the big time, man. Kalamazoo.

[01:18:13.630 --> 01:18:14.110]
Wasn't it?

[01:18:14.450 --> 01:18:14.790]
Oh, yeah.

[01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:15.690]
It was then.

[01:18:16.190 --> 01:18:16.770]
Who would have thought?

[01:18:17.190 --> 01:18:17.990]
I wonder if there were whatever.

[01:18:18.310 --> 01:18:19.690]
A lot of those people are probably dead.

[01:18:19.810 --> 01:18:22.270]
Can you imagine all the people that we used to know were probably dead by now?

[01:18:23.090 --> 01:18:26.610]
I mean, people we worked with, people we were listeners, people we were just...

[01:18:26.610 --> 01:18:30.390]
Like, like, babbs, people who are used to be people.

[01:18:30.730 --> 01:18:32.510]
And now they're like rotting bones and flesh.

[01:18:34.150 --> 01:18:35.830]
The worms are having a field day.

[01:18:36.050 --> 01:18:37.790]
I shouldn't have said that because then you wouldn't need any more ice cream.

[01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:39.110]
How's Josh doing on the ice cream?

[01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:40.350]
He had like two types of airwatt.

[01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:41.350]
No, I'm not.

[01:18:41.530 --> 01:18:42.890]
He put out the weight before I dive into my second.

[01:18:43.670 --> 01:18:45.690]
Otherwise, he'll be missing for about 45 minutes.

[01:18:47.550 --> 01:18:49.710]
And it'll be really bad if you go there and it's a full house.

[01:18:50.350 --> 01:18:53.090]
I'll pull a peanut boy, but Chuck will be coming out of my nose and that.

[01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.650]
Oh, yeah.

[01:18:54.550 --> 01:18:55.170]
He knows.

[01:18:56.950 --> 01:18:57.310]
Rectome.

[01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:04.210]
Man, can she sing?

[01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:04.530]
No.

[01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:07.090]
Can she bell out about an 18th of an ounce of sour wine?

[01:19:07.090 --> 01:19:07.290]
Wow.

[01:19:07.770 --> 01:19:08.790]
That wasn't ready to sing.

[01:19:09.270 --> 01:19:09.430]
I'm already.

[01:19:09.890 --> 01:19:10.130]
Yeah.

[01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:14.190]
232 votes on the pool in case you're wondering what's that pool all about?

[01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:15.510]
Well, I don't know if we want to tell you're not.

[01:19:15.690 --> 01:19:16.190]
I guess we will.

[01:19:16.670 --> 01:19:19.090]
Which ultra-rich person you despise the most?

[01:19:19.390 --> 01:19:19.950]
Rupert Murdock.

[01:19:19.950 --> 01:19:21.250]
He's got to down his pants.

[01:19:21.570 --> 01:19:21.930]
411.

[01:19:22.330 --> 01:19:22.810]
Hands down.

[01:19:22.810 --> 01:19:24.750]
I hate them all 168.

[01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:26.230]
Sound really jealous to me.

[01:19:26.430 --> 01:19:26.770]
Sound bitter.

[01:19:27.210 --> 01:19:28.230]
Oprah 162.

[01:19:28.490 --> 01:19:29.490]
Donald Trump on 58.

[01:19:29.890 --> 01:19:31.050]
Wayne Heisenga 141.

[01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:33.270]
Those are the only big shooters on there.

[01:19:33.390 --> 01:19:34.810]
I hate this pool's only got 75.6%.

[01:19:35.710 --> 01:19:37.190]
George Steinbrunner on 63.

[01:19:37.670 --> 01:19:38.430]
Ted Turner 35.

[01:19:38.950 --> 01:19:39.610]
Bill Gates 19.

[01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:41.770]
Warren Buffett has still only got five.

[01:19:42.010 --> 01:19:43.590]
I'm sure they're thinking of Jimmy Buffett.

[01:19:43.810 --> 01:19:47.790]
The biggest name of best talent for this is Leo Rogers.

[01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:48.810]
41.560.

[01:19:50.290 --> 01:19:50.850]
UAM.

[01:19:52.810 --> 01:19:54.530]
It is Coach Don Schueller.

[01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:57.210]
And I sound like Bob Hope on acid.

[01:19:57.550 --> 01:20:00.970]
And I want to tell you, it's the 12-to-1 hour or whatever it is.

[01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:07.470]
The bad Bruns-Hell dropped dead and burned in hell.

[01:20:07.810 --> 01:20:12.870]
It's much too late to confess that I arrived was just for oil.

[01:20:13.210 --> 01:20:16.870]
We hope you die of festering for oils.

[01:20:17.090 --> 01:20:17.310]
Yes.

[01:20:17.610 --> 01:20:19.950]
You know you're pretty stinking old.

[01:20:19.950 --> 01:20:23.310]
But he will never die so.

[01:20:23.730 --> 01:20:28.130]
I was about a nice refreshing dog on the waterboard.

[01:20:28.550 --> 01:20:31.410]
That your house had black water as cold.

[01:20:33.490 --> 01:20:37.750]
And there were many unknowns and those you didn't know.

[01:20:38.270 --> 01:20:40.930]
That most they were unknowns.

[01:20:41.890 --> 01:20:47.870]
Go tell the Germans about your platform concentration camps.

[01:20:49.290 --> 01:20:50.810]
Your pants are gone.

[01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:54.750]
Press agency has been detained.

[01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:59.290]
Just like push on down your failure and disgrace.

[01:21:00.590 --> 01:21:02.790]
The harbinger of dreams.

[01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:05.290]
Come on to it.

[01:21:05.490 --> 01:21:05.890]
560.

[01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:07.050]
Happy Friday to you all.

[01:21:07.090 --> 01:21:09.770]
We have some people out there don't want us to be happy no matter what it is.

[01:21:09.890 --> 01:21:10.870]
Here's Herb and Coral Springs.

[01:21:11.130 --> 01:21:12.510]
Who's a real pain in the ass by the way.

[01:21:12.570 --> 01:21:12.990]
Remember Herb?

[01:21:13.250 --> 01:21:13.750]
No, do I?

[01:21:14.130 --> 01:21:14.830]
Always a Kvetch.

[01:21:14.830 --> 01:21:15.470]
He's a Kvetch.

[01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:17.810]
Anyway, he says it's rough streaming today.

[01:21:17.950 --> 01:21:19.290]
Lots of dropouts and knockoffs.

[01:21:19.290 --> 01:21:20.430]
Yesterday was perfecto.

[01:21:20.670 --> 01:21:22.290]
Yesterday we had complaints of the old ear.

[01:21:22.530 --> 01:21:22.690]
Sure.

[01:21:23.210 --> 01:21:25.050]
Lots of dropouts and knockoffs.

[01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:28.790]
I thought a knockoff was like a ripoff of a brand name product.

[01:21:29.210 --> 01:21:31.990]
What is a knockoff on audio?

[01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:32.850]
Or it's a hit.

[01:21:34.150 --> 01:21:36.170]
Still hoping to hear something that you'll be moving this serious.

[01:21:36.490 --> 01:21:38.090]
Hi George, thanks Herb and Coral Springs.

[01:21:38.370 --> 01:21:38.910]
Hey Herb, bye.

[01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.610]
You know, get lost.

[01:21:40.830 --> 01:21:41.930]
We have no other complaints.

[01:21:42.050 --> 01:21:42.830]
Everything is just fine.

[01:21:43.470 --> 01:21:44.450]
Oh, we're fine.

[01:21:44.450 --> 01:21:48.150]
We see nine dropouts though on the, although it's still a green light is on there on my thing.

[01:21:48.610 --> 01:21:48.790]
Mm-hmm.

[01:21:48.850 --> 01:21:51.610]
On the swishing, I mean the, whatever it is.

[01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:52.670]
Oh, speak of the internet.

[01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:53.130]
YouTube.

[01:21:53.950 --> 01:21:54.390]
YouTube.

[01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:59.510]
The popular online video hosting service is issued a cease and desist order to blogger Michael

[01:21:59.510 --> 01:22:04.770]
Errington of Tech Crunch, demanding him move a downloadable tool which captures videos

[01:22:04.770 --> 01:22:06.870]
from the site, Technology Daily Web Reports.

[01:22:07.810 --> 01:22:11.390]
Errington had created the program and maintains that it does not violate you-

[01:22:11.390 --> 01:22:11.910]
YouTube.

[01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:13.290]
It's a service, a term of service.

[01:22:13.710 --> 01:22:17.170]
Ex-scripts from the article a cease and desist letter sent by the video sharing site.

[01:22:17.310 --> 01:22:17.750]
YouTube.

[01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:21.750]
To a well-known technology pun it as wrangled bloggers in the last 24 hours.

[01:22:22.150 --> 01:22:22.770]
It's wrangled them.

[01:22:23.090 --> 01:22:24.850]
We've got dropouts and they're beginning wrangled.

[01:22:25.330 --> 01:22:28.470]
Tech Crunch is Michael Errington received letter earlier this week from Wilson,

[01:22:28.770 --> 01:22:33.050]
San Cini, Goodrich and Rosati attorney, Karen Swope, who accused him of violating the

[01:22:33.050 --> 01:22:38.470]
YouTube term of use of torches interference and business relationships of committing an unfair

[01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:40.350]
business practice and a false advertising.

[01:22:40.730 --> 01:22:41.990]
All of these things.

[01:22:42.970 --> 01:22:47.250]
Errington said on his blog that Tech Crunch's offense was developing a small tool that looks

[01:22:47.250 --> 01:22:48.490]
people download you-

[01:22:48.490 --> 01:22:48.850]
YouTube.

[01:22:49.110 --> 01:22:50.250]
Videos to their hard drives.

[01:22:50.630 --> 01:22:54.190]
The application was referenced in a recent post that told readers how to move you-

[01:22:54.190 --> 01:22:54.670]
YouTube.

[01:22:54.890 --> 01:22:57.050]
Videos to their portable digital devices.

[01:22:57.770 --> 01:23:02.030]
Errington launched Tech Crunch in June of last year, said he created a new tool after carefully

[01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:03.350]
reviewing the terms of you-

[01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.790]
YouTube.

[01:23:03.790 --> 01:23:08.450]
Would state if you download or print a copy of the content for personal use you must retain

[01:23:08.450 --> 01:23:11.950]
all copyright and other proprietary notices contained therein.

[01:23:12.050 --> 01:23:13.190]
Do you understand what that means?

[01:23:13.790 --> 01:23:14.010]
No.

[01:23:14.850 --> 01:23:17.030]
Having got a clue and obviously he doesn't either.

[01:23:17.310 --> 01:23:22.210]
They got a lot of hootspots considering that they were allowing copyrighted contract on there for ages.

[01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:24.410]
Wait, does he have a lot of hootspots?

[01:23:24.510 --> 01:23:24.970]
Yeah, amen.

[01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:25.890]
Yeah, that's right.

[01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:26.550]
That's a good point.

[01:23:27.230 --> 01:23:27.630]
I should say.

[01:23:28.010 --> 01:23:31.650]
And they were being threatened with 80 billion lawsuits and you got all this copyrighted stuff on there

[01:23:31.650 --> 01:23:34.550]
and you better cease and desist and cut the crap and all that.

[01:23:35.370 --> 01:23:38.210]
I say it's out there in space.

[01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:39.330]
It's out there in space.

[01:23:39.510 --> 01:23:40.170]
It's in the Eastwick.

[01:23:40.350 --> 01:23:40.690]
That's right.

[01:23:40.790 --> 01:23:41.490]
And if you can grab it?

[01:23:41.810 --> 01:23:42.330]
Grab it.

[01:23:42.710 --> 01:23:43.070]
That's right.

[01:23:43.190 --> 01:23:44.750]
If you got a chance to get it, grab it.

[01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:46.450]
Just like those pictures I got on our website.

[01:23:47.010 --> 01:23:48.990]
If you got a chance to get your hands on it, grab it.

[01:23:49.610 --> 01:23:50.450]
Like a handbag.

[01:23:50.970 --> 01:23:51.110]
Ooh.

[01:23:51.870 --> 01:23:52.650]
Anyway, get off of that.

[01:23:52.730 --> 01:23:54.350]
Okay, between the ice cream and Brady Quinn.

[01:23:54.670 --> 01:23:55.790]
You're a bad influence, okay?

[01:23:56.350 --> 01:23:59.410]
Very important death and you didn't even remind me to talk about it.

[01:23:59.650 --> 01:23:59.770]
What?

[01:24:00.270 --> 01:24:00.350]
Huh?

[01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:03.130]
Economist Milton Friedman dies.

[01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:05.030]
I mentioned that this morning.

[01:24:05.390 --> 01:24:05.630]
When?

[01:24:05.970 --> 01:24:08.510]
When I saw it on my celebrity death beeper thing.

[01:24:08.850 --> 01:24:09.950]
You mentioned that too to me?

[01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:10.710]
Yeah.

[01:24:11.190 --> 01:24:12.030]
That had you do.

[01:24:12.030 --> 01:24:13.510]
You were ignoring me like you always did.

[01:24:13.850 --> 01:24:14.530]
Yeah, well, probably.

[01:24:14.750 --> 01:24:15.690]
Probably for good reason.

[01:24:15.990 --> 01:24:16.170]
For who?

[01:24:16.590 --> 01:24:17.990]
That was probably before I was in here.

[01:24:18.210 --> 01:24:18.790]
You were probably saying.

[01:24:19.090 --> 01:24:21.470]
Well, Milton Friedman, I probably had the attrota paper off.

[01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:23.510]
I was making a joke because I never heard of it.

[01:24:23.630 --> 01:24:24.890]
I was making a joke.

[01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:25.890]
I was making a joke.

[01:24:25.890 --> 01:24:25.950]
I was making a joke.

[01:24:25.950 --> 01:24:26.290]
I was making a joke.

[01:24:26.290 --> 01:24:29.010]
I was making a joke.

[01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:30.330]
I was making a joke.

[01:24:30.330 --> 01:24:31.010]
It was just lived in 94.

[01:24:31.130 --> 01:24:32.070]
How many more years that would be?

[01:24:32.130 --> 01:24:33.090]
About 30, man.

[01:24:33.270 --> 01:24:33.710]
Oh, boy.

[01:24:33.810 --> 01:24:34.230]
No chance.

[01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:37.190]
Not with all this bad blood sugars and all that ice cream and stuff.

[01:24:37.570 --> 01:24:38.990]
And now you got my ampethat all whipped up.

[01:24:39.250 --> 01:24:43.970]
I'm going to go over to my neighborhood Dominion, my supermarket, and see what kind of big

[01:24:43.970 --> 01:24:44.770]
quartz they got.

[01:24:44.890 --> 01:24:47.770]
You know, half gallons or big tubs of goopy, goopy stuff.

[01:24:47.950 --> 01:24:49.190]
You know, like, you know what I'm...

[01:24:49.710 --> 01:24:50.750]
Sounds good though, doesn't it?

[01:24:51.130 --> 01:24:51.490]
Yeah, it does.

[01:24:51.930 --> 01:24:52.930]
Well, right now, I caught.

[01:24:53.230 --> 01:24:53.710]
Sounds good.

[01:24:57.190 --> 01:25:00.050]
Milton Friedman, Nobel Prize winner economist who championed individual

[01:25:00.050 --> 01:25:03.910]
freedom influenced the economic policies of three presidents and befriended

[01:25:03.910 --> 01:25:08.890]
world leaders died yesterday he was a mere 94 he was just a spring chicken got a

[01:25:08.890 --> 01:25:11.910]
picture of him and his wife Rose in their San Francisco part in October

[01:25:11.910 --> 01:25:15.110]
looks to me like she beat him by about ten years but she still he's still

[01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:19.230]
grabbing on to her good god whoo you know what's too bad in that picture although

[01:25:19.230 --> 01:25:22.650]

[01:25:22.650 --> 01:25:25.970]
Fangarey spokesman for the Milton and Rose Friedman Foundation in Indianapolis

[01:25:25.970 --> 01:25:29.770]

more than thirty years after the mental health committee classified homosexuality

[01:35:25.830 --> 01:35:29.110]

[01:35:29.110 --> 01:35:32.490]
mischaracterize it as a defect said representative Marty me and Massachusetts

[01:35:32.490 --> 01:35:34.490]

attention and prisoner abusive to forage judges w bush and an attempt to make it look like a

[01:42:01.810 --> 01:42:05.870]
law that actually represents the u.s. we all know and love we in congress have our own obligation

[01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:09.890]
to work in a bipartisan way to repair the damage that's been done to protect our international

[01:42:09.890 --> 01:42:14.450]

which will accord to dot's office ensure that u.s. servicemen and women are afforded the maximum

[01:42:36.510 --> 01:42:41.450]
protection of a strong international legal framework guaranteed by respect for such provisions as

[01:42:41.450 --> 01:42:45.470]
the jimmy conventions and other international standards the connectic and democrats

[01:42:45.470 --> 01:42:49.310]
legislators also intended to restore some of the moral authority america lost with the rest of

[01:42:49.310 --> 01:42:53.210]
the world when it gave the west government's executive branch the sweeping ability to breach

[01:42:53.210 --> 01:42:58.310]
civil liberties in a man of moral like a dictatorship then a democracy rights bob goger it's clear

[01:42:58.310 --> 01:43:01.750]
the people are perpetrated these horrendous crimes against our country and our people have no moral

[01:43:01.750 --> 01:43:06.370]
compass and deserve to be prosecuted the full extent of the law said dot but in taking away their

[01:43:06.370 --> 01:43:10.430]
legal rights the rights first codified in our country's constitution we're taking away our own

[01:43:10.430 --> 01:43:15.110]
moral compass as well he'd be saying among other things the effective terrorist prosecution act will

[01:43:15.110 --> 01:43:20.290]
do the following restore habeas corpus protection to detainees narrowed the definition of unlawful

[01:43:20.290 --> 01:43:24.490]
enemy combatants to individuals who directly participate in hostilities against the u.s. who are not

[01:43:24.490 --> 01:43:28.850]
lawful combatants our information granted through coercion from being introduced as evidence in

[01:43:28.850 --> 01:43:34.390]
trials empower military judges to exclude hearsay evidence they deemed to be unreliable authorize the

[01:43:34.390 --> 01:43:38.510]
west credit appeals for the armed forces to review decisions by the military commissions limit the

[01:43:38.510 --> 01:43:41.610]
authority of the president to interpret the meaning and application of the jeniva conventions

[01:43:41.610 --> 01:43:46.730]
and make that authority subject to congressional and judicial oversight and provide for expedited

[01:43:46.730 --> 01:43:51.230]
judicial review of the military commissions acted determined the constitutionality of its provisions

[01:43:51.890 --> 01:43:56.150]
many americans have bought into right wing spin that says democrats don't like bushes torture bill

[01:43:56.150 --> 01:44:00.270]
because they want to protect the rights of the terrorists this is because team bush is carefully

[01:44:00.270 --> 01:44:03.790]
hidden the ugly truth behind this law that the powered grants would allow the bush administration

[01:44:03.790 --> 01:44:08.010]
to pluck any american off the street declare them an enemy combined and hold them without counsel and

[01:44:08.010 --> 01:44:12.350]
without other other constitutional protections said dot yesterday i take a backseat to no one when

[01:44:12.350 --> 01:44:15.910]
it comes to protecting this country from terrorists that there's a right way to do this in a wrong

[01:44:15.910 --> 01:44:19.610]
way to do it it's kind of like a radio there's a right way to do it and there's a wrong way to do it

[01:44:19.610 --> 01:44:25.130]
and there's the a beastly way doing which generally tends to be much closer to the wrong way so how

community vice president publisher of bibles for zander van a grand Rapids based division of

[01:54:41.690 --> 01:54:46.730]
newscorp owned harper columns bibles for zander van zander van started shipping bible experience

[01:54:46.730 --> 01:54:49.990]
in late september and sold more than sit by the way i got a new ball been here i just stuck in it

[01:54:49.990 --> 01:54:55.410]
man i can read things and actually see what i'm reading that great yet is now i i never really

[01:54:55.410 --> 01:54:58.590]
thought about this even all the years haven't alive there's some things that you never really

[01:54:58.590 --> 01:55:03.050]
think about when a light bulb goes out i'm asking you because you're such a genius right so you

[01:55:03.050 --> 01:55:08.830]
tell us when a light bulb goes out when the filament just up like that and it dies has the has the

[01:55:08.830 --> 01:55:13.530]
bulb getting dimmer as it gets older and uh... you know what i'm saying what's funny you should ask

[01:55:13.530 --> 01:55:17.830]
that because a lot of times the bulb will burn brighter right before it dies really and i asked my

[01:55:17.830 --> 01:55:23.230]
science teacher that he said that because the the filament is suspended in a non-axid uh... oxygen

[01:55:23.230 --> 01:55:27.590]
what's inside the bulb is not oxygen so that the filament doesn't burn out when the bulb gets a crack

[01:55:27.590 --> 01:55:32.430]
in it then the oxygen seeps in so then the filament starts to burn and therefore it burns brighter

[01:55:32.430 --> 01:55:36.870]
and then it burns up and then it goes out and that's a lot of times what happens that that doesn't

[01:55:36.870 --> 01:55:42.410]
answer my question that that that that that that's really interesting i mean moderately not not

[01:55:42.410 --> 01:55:46.990]
tremendously but what i'm saying is is the bulb is getting older it's been there for like a long

[01:55:46.990 --> 01:55:50.590]
long time which i don't think i ever replace that so that's been there for like five years you know

[01:55:50.590 --> 01:55:55.910]
that might have been a dim bulb to begin with it was dim sonda van started speaking of things that

[01:55:55.910 --> 01:55:59.930]
are dim bible experience in late september so more than seventy thousand units came in to say

[01:55:59.930 --> 01:56:03.910]
what if he's came to ken come in to you who croaked who used to play for the asterisk who didn't

[01:56:03.930 --> 01:56:09.210]
he croaked out yes he did it's those roads he had bad roads by the way i can he coached a

[01:56:09.210 --> 01:56:14.150]
michigan from sixty nine to eighty nine shambucker well and uh... he was uh... mad dogs coach

[01:56:14.150 --> 01:56:18.510]
because mad dog was on a seventy two dolphins who would think that he was playing from michigan like uh...

[01:56:18.510 --> 01:56:22.490]
you know around seventy is when you you think yeah i'm sure he was pretty tight with coach bow

[01:56:22.490 --> 01:56:26.010]
and he's gonna be there there's something right there from life spent a long time on and of course

[01:56:26.010 --> 01:56:30.450]
this week we got the big ol house they'd michigan game count up for number one right yes i'll see who

[01:56:30.450 --> 01:56:33.450]
my root for that game i think michigan's got another pretty good looking quarterback

[01:56:34.330 --> 01:56:38.290]
bike what what are you laughing about i have no interest neither one of those schools i hit him

[01:56:38.290 --> 01:56:42.630]
like poison both of them i mean if i can root for no today because brady quinnis plan that i can

[01:56:42.630 --> 01:56:46.870]
root for michigan when tom brady when i pulled out that uh... was it the rose bull against some of the

[01:56:46.870 --> 01:56:51.870]
UCLA whoever that was was that is last uh... college game i agree on the level come back they

[02:03:26.530 --> 02:03:27.890]
But this game is the most

[02:03:28.430 --> 02:03:33.230]
and we did show.

[02:03:33.550 --> 02:03:35.230]
All you need is now.

[02:03:35.850 --> 02:03:37.390]
Now we can't get it.

[02:03:37.810 --> 02:03:39.850]
All you need is now.

[02:03:40.410 --> 02:03:41.670]
And we'll be able to get it.

[02:03:42.210 --> 02:03:44.410]
All you need is a show.

[02:03:44.870 --> 02:03:45.490]
And we'll blow.

[02:03:46.750 --> 02:03:48.290]
Like, we all look at the video.

[02:03:48.910 --> 02:03:50.290]
We'll probably get a little more handed.

[02:03:50.690 --> 02:03:51.470]
We'll find a way something.

[02:03:52.070 --> 02:03:53.430]
Check, told me to give you this.

[02:03:53.570 --> 02:03:54.430]
What is he doing?

[02:03:56.010 --> 02:03:57.450]
Are you going to go fire me?

[02:03:57.990 --> 02:03:58.910]
I go, fire me.

[02:03:59.090 --> 02:04:01.010]
102-560-WQ-A-M.

[02:04:02.310 --> 02:04:04.770]
You know, I turned on that Panther Game last night on the package.

[02:04:04.790 --> 02:04:06.190]
And it was gildy, you know, on TV.

[02:04:06.470 --> 02:04:07.850]
And I turned it off real quick.

[02:04:08.370 --> 02:04:09.310]
I thought, oh, that voice.

[02:04:09.570 --> 02:04:10.390]
That voice, you know.

[02:04:10.770 --> 02:04:13.090]
It was like fingernails scratching on my ass,

[02:04:13.330 --> 02:04:15.310]
coming right through my expensive TV set.

[02:04:15.650 --> 02:04:16.310]
I shut it right off.

[02:04:16.570 --> 02:04:17.950]
13-9-51 votes on the full.

[02:04:18.070 --> 02:04:20.070]
So here's the very sketchy detail.

[02:04:20.070 --> 02:04:21.970]
We're going to see here the details very sketchy.

[02:04:22.430 --> 02:04:24.710]
For Shambackler, the winningest coach in Michigan football history

[02:04:24.710 --> 02:04:27.530]
died today after collapsing during a taping of a TV show,

[02:04:27.930 --> 02:04:29.990]
according to three-Echoid TV stations, he was 77.

[02:04:30.730 --> 02:04:32.370]
Now, the fact that he died during the taping of the show,

[02:04:32.410 --> 02:04:34.650]
which means they probably haven't dying on tape.

[02:04:35.110 --> 02:04:35.650]
You see what I'm saying?

[02:04:36.090 --> 02:04:36.190]
Yeah.

[02:04:36.690 --> 02:04:38.810]
And knowing what a bunch of grave robbers the media people are,

[02:04:38.930 --> 02:04:40.050]
they're probably going to be showing that.

[02:04:40.390 --> 02:04:41.850]
It'll probably be on you tube.

[02:04:42.210 --> 02:04:43.430]
Oh, here, watch the coach croak.

[02:04:43.570 --> 02:04:44.390]
You know, like that, bad.

[02:04:45.090 --> 02:04:46.970]
Shambackler's death was reported by WXYZ,

[02:04:46.970 --> 02:04:49.890]
the EWDIV and WJBK, which didn't cite sources.

[02:04:50.370 --> 02:04:52.330]
He died a day before the second rank wolf reans

[02:04:52.330 --> 02:04:53.770]
was scheduled to be number one Ohio State,

[02:04:54.110 --> 02:04:56.010]
and the ladies in solidity, the century-old rivalry.

[02:04:56.610 --> 02:04:58.910]
And here's a picture of old boat only today over 100.

[02:04:59.470 --> 02:05:00.990]
77 could pass for 100 easy.

[02:05:02.550 --> 02:05:04.230]
Not one of my favorite people, but then again,

[02:05:04.330 --> 02:05:06.050]
of course, I went to Michigan State for about five minutes,

[02:05:06.190 --> 02:05:06.690]
and he was the...

[02:05:06.690 --> 02:05:08.350]
And of course, our coach, Deffi Dirty,

[02:05:09.070 --> 02:05:10.090]
two yards in a cloud of dust,

[02:05:10.510 --> 02:05:11.750]
not my favorite coaches.

[02:05:11.870 --> 02:05:14.010]
And of course, there was always Woody Hayes, a relay hole.

[02:05:14.370 --> 02:05:15.890]
What is it about these college coaches,

[02:05:15.890 --> 02:05:17.610]
guys, that most of them are such A-holes.

[02:05:18.170 --> 02:05:20.310]
Like Joe Pa, you know, Bobby Bowden.

[02:05:20.610 --> 02:05:21.890]
You're just talking about the geasers or...

[02:05:22.610 --> 02:05:24.350]
Well, the guys who have been the Empire Builders,

[02:05:24.350 --> 02:05:25.930]
the ones that we were around for a long, long time.

[02:05:26.090 --> 02:05:26.730]
Most of them are A-holes.

[02:05:27.290 --> 02:05:29.250]
Maybe because they take themselves so seriously, you know?

[02:05:29.410 --> 02:05:30.990]
It's like other sports-type people.

[02:05:31.050 --> 02:05:32.230]
They're taken for all very seriously.

[02:05:32.790 --> 02:05:34.810]
As opposed to having, like, any sense of humor about it?

[02:05:36.210 --> 02:05:37.230]
1357 votes on a pool.

[02:05:37.310 --> 02:05:39.250]
Our goal is to get to 14 today, and our Friday day

[02:05:39.250 --> 02:05:40.550]
would be a real feather in your crap.

[02:05:40.830 --> 02:05:42.650]
And speaking of crap, man, Georgia's going to be...

[02:05:42.650 --> 02:05:44.550]
He's going to be a busy beaver the rest of the day.

[02:05:44.550 --> 02:05:44.970]
I'll say that.

[02:05:45.290 --> 02:05:46.870]
Well, Josh already got the jump on me.

[02:05:47.010 --> 02:05:47.250]
Did he?

[02:05:47.350 --> 02:05:48.850]
He's just lucky you weren't talking to him.

[02:05:49.530 --> 02:05:51.070]
What was it, like, a half hour ago?

[02:05:51.410 --> 02:05:52.010]
What did I tell you?

[02:05:52.350 --> 02:05:52.850]
I knew it.

[02:05:53.130 --> 02:05:54.710]
The mad rush to flush.

[02:05:55.830 --> 02:05:57.790]
But at least it's something we don't do all the time, you know?

[02:05:57.870 --> 02:06:00.010]
I remember those Z-day days, and the INZ days.

[02:06:00.250 --> 02:06:01.710]
I remember, how about the IOD days?

[02:06:02.070 --> 02:06:02.170]
Good.

[02:06:02.290 --> 02:06:03.810]
We have food coming to that place or what?

[02:06:04.030 --> 02:06:04.190]
Yeah.

[02:06:04.750 --> 02:06:05.410]
That was insane.

[02:06:06.370 --> 02:06:07.430]
Now, I'm trying to think of the...

[02:06:07.430 --> 02:06:07.850]
A Paxon.

[02:06:08.550 --> 02:06:09.930]
How long did that go on?

[02:06:10.290 --> 02:06:10.570]
A year.

[02:06:11.010 --> 02:06:11.550]
No, it did not.

[02:06:11.710 --> 02:06:12.210]
Get out of here.

[02:06:12.310 --> 02:06:13.010]
A year of my ass.

[02:06:13.010 --> 02:06:13.850]
We were at Paxon.

[02:06:13.850 --> 02:06:15.410]
We started in November.

[02:06:15.570 --> 02:06:16.870]
We were not at Paxon for a year.

[02:06:17.010 --> 02:06:17.990]
We left there in May.

[02:06:18.250 --> 02:06:19.830]
My contract was for a year.

[02:06:20.310 --> 02:06:23.850]
And then they paid me off in May to go the hell away, which was sweet.

[02:06:24.390 --> 02:06:24.990]
Don't you remember that?

[02:06:25.330 --> 02:06:25.590]
Okay.

[02:06:25.950 --> 02:06:26.830]
We weren't there for a year.

[02:06:26.910 --> 02:06:27.810]
It may seem like a year.

[02:06:27.830 --> 02:06:28.490]
It felt like a year.

[02:06:28.970 --> 02:06:30.010]
It felt like a finger.

[02:06:30.350 --> 02:06:30.890]
It felt like a lifetime.

[02:06:31.690 --> 02:06:33.410]
But anyway, what that was I saying about being there?

[02:06:33.610 --> 02:06:34.050]
All the food.

[02:06:34.670 --> 02:06:35.970]
Now, wasn't that the place where the...

[02:06:35.970 --> 02:06:38.030]
Of course, the engineer was a real, real a-holder.

[02:06:38.190 --> 02:06:38.730]
What that was his name?

[02:06:38.850 --> 02:06:39.490]
Oh, I know what it was.

[02:06:40.410 --> 02:06:41.590]
The engineer's name was...

[02:06:41.590 --> 02:06:41.870]
Roy!

[02:06:42.570 --> 02:06:42.890]
Right?

[02:06:43.370 --> 02:06:43.450]
Right.

[02:06:43.890 --> 02:06:46.390]
And he was a jerk and he made us get rid of all those carts.

[02:06:46.970 --> 02:06:47.070]
Right?

[02:06:47.590 --> 02:06:49.010]
Well, we don't do carts at Paxon.

[02:06:49.110 --> 02:06:49.630]
We don't do...

[02:06:49.630 --> 02:06:49.630]

[02:06:49.830 --> 02:06:51.210]
Although I will say this for him, you know.

[02:06:51.570 --> 02:06:52.230]
Whatever we needed.

[02:06:52.530 --> 02:06:53.850]
Remember we needed the DCS?

[02:06:54.310 --> 02:06:54.570]
Mm-hmm.

[02:06:55.010 --> 02:06:57.030]
Whatever piece of equipment we needed no matter how much it was.

[02:06:57.230 --> 02:06:58.230]
Go out and get it, order it.

[02:06:58.270 --> 02:06:59.430]
You know, because he had the big box.

[02:06:59.570 --> 02:07:01.050]
You know, loaded with his swimming and money.

[02:07:01.510 --> 02:07:04.390]
A man with no talent whatsoever who just talk about Muzzle Man.

[02:07:04.410 --> 02:07:05.570]
There were a buddy-bud Paxon.

[02:07:05.970 --> 02:07:07.610]
So he didn't have a spare any expense.

[02:07:07.790 --> 02:07:09.350]
And of course, he built us those beautiful studios.

[02:07:09.350 --> 02:07:09.950]
You remember that?

[02:07:10.330 --> 02:07:10.650]
Oh, yeah.

[02:07:11.490 --> 02:07:12.770]
Polatio, you could eat off the floor.

[02:07:13.370 --> 02:07:15.890]
But speaking of that, didn't they not allow us to have food in there?

[02:07:15.990 --> 02:07:16.610]
And how we had food?

[02:07:16.870 --> 02:07:18.650]
We would never work that in the show where we didn't have food in.

[02:07:18.830 --> 02:07:19.110]
Exactly.

[02:07:19.410 --> 02:07:22.070]
Everyone makes an attempt to keep you from getting food in the studio.

[02:07:22.070 --> 02:07:23.170]
No food allowed in the studio.

[02:07:23.310 --> 02:07:24.550]
And then of course, we do whatever it is that we want.

[02:07:24.890 --> 02:07:25.890]
No smoking allowed in the studio.

[02:07:26.010 --> 02:07:28.670]
And then I used to light up the storeys all the time before I gave them up

[02:07:28.670 --> 02:07:29.610]
because I didn't want to kill myself.

[02:07:30.110 --> 02:07:30.690]
Remember that crap?

[02:07:30.950 --> 02:07:31.090]
Mm-hmm.

[02:07:31.270 --> 02:07:33.790]
Oh, and you'll smoke at a big fat storey in there.

[02:07:33.890 --> 02:07:36.110]
And Georgia's smoking a big fat one too, but not a cigar, you know.

[02:07:36.490 --> 02:07:37.330]
Well, two freaking bad.

[02:07:37.450 --> 02:07:38.530]
Okay, mind your own business.

[02:07:39.050 --> 02:07:42.390]
There's nothing worse than working for militant A-holes who don't know their answer.

[02:07:42.750 --> 02:07:45.510]
And in addition to which, when you're what they got, you don't say when you're the franchise.

[02:07:46.070 --> 02:07:46.210]
Right?

[02:07:46.410 --> 02:07:49.550]
When you're what they got, they had to be, they should pick you up in a limo every day.

[02:07:49.830 --> 02:07:50.570]
Both of you guys.

[02:07:51.030 --> 02:07:51.730]
Pick you up in a limo.

[02:07:51.790 --> 02:07:55.190]
They should pick my ass up in a limo and bring me from my bedroom into this studio every day.

[02:07:56.170 --> 02:07:56.510]
What's nice?

[02:07:56.670 --> 02:07:57.490]
And I see it goes to Georgia.

[02:07:57.650 --> 02:07:58.930]
I should probably get in the cab at two.

[02:07:58.990 --> 02:07:59.530]
I won't do it.

[02:07:59.830 --> 02:08:01.510]
I'm not going to go out there again today and risk my luck.

[02:08:01.910 --> 02:08:04.650]
When you go too often and you press your luck, that's when you lose your ass.

[02:08:04.850 --> 02:08:06.530]
But it must be a lucky Friday, wouldn't you think?

[02:08:06.530 --> 02:08:10.030]
That the delivery guy came knocking on the door when, right in the beginning of a break.

[02:08:10.210 --> 02:08:11.050]
Right. And they have a big rush.

[02:08:11.410 --> 02:08:14.690]
Like, oh gee, I think the brakes are there like, you know, he didn't have any idea what's going on.

[02:08:14.930 --> 02:08:17.190]
Plus I had to put my shorts on and my shirt.

[02:08:17.470 --> 02:08:21.830]
I'm not going to go naked in the door for some delivery guy, especially when it looks like that.

[02:08:22.330 --> 02:08:23.990]
Did you get it like a camera or something?

[02:08:24.850 --> 02:08:25.530]
A camera for what?

[02:08:25.690 --> 02:08:26.690]
See what the delivery guy looks like?

[02:08:26.850 --> 02:08:27.930]
Sure. Before you make up your mind.

[02:08:28.450 --> 02:08:33.730]
Details on house races in which the outcome remains on the side of the candidate may seek a recount as of right now.

[02:08:33.730 --> 02:08:39.370]
It's just amazing. Here it is. One was the election a week ago, Tuesday or two weeks ago, 14th a week ago.

[02:08:39.930 --> 02:08:44.690]
New Mexico, first district Republican representative Heath Wilson, Heather Wilson, led Democrat Patricia Madrid,

[02:08:45.090 --> 02:08:52.850]
by fewer than 1500 votes on more than 200,000 cash, official disqualified 645 ballots Wednesday, leaving about 2500 to be counted.

[02:08:53.350 --> 02:08:58.910]
North Carolina, eighth district, representative Robin Hayes, a Republican led Democrat Larry Kissel by about 450 votes,

[02:08:58.910 --> 02:09:04.110]
about 1500 provisional ballots remain to be counted, final results expected maybe today, maybe and who knows?

[02:09:04.450 --> 02:09:09.530]
They're making them up. Ohio's second district representative Jean Schmidt, a Republican who called Dec. Vietnam,

[02:09:09.690 --> 02:09:14.250]
Federal and Representative John Murther, a coward, was a head of Democrat Victoria Wilson by about 2800 votes,

[02:09:14.570 --> 02:09:19.430]
workers at Big In County, provisional and absentee ballots, next week, they're going to start counting them next week.

[02:09:20.130 --> 02:09:27.910]
I know how is 15th district representative Deborah Price, a member of the House Republican leadership leads Democratic Mary Jo Kilroy by about 3536, 3500.

[02:09:28.660 --> 02:09:35.300]
Thousands of provisional ballots are be counted beginning on Sunday, a day later than normal indifference to the Ohio State Michigan's football game tomorrow.

[02:09:35.620 --> 02:09:41.080]
I know we talked about that before, and I don't understand what's coming of the votes got to do with some stupid as football game.

[02:09:41.320 --> 02:09:46.740]
No wonder both Shembeckler died. Now can't you see the emotional lift that it's going to give Michigan now in a game tomorrow, Josh?

[02:09:46.900 --> 02:09:51.100]
Don't you think so? That's right. They're playing for their old coach. They're playing for bowl, baby.

[02:09:51.100 --> 02:09:54.380]
They're going to lift them up and kick some serious ass or maybe not.

[02:09:54.760 --> 02:10:01.120]
Wyoming for a system Republican representative Barbara Cuban was certified Wednesday as the winner over Democrat Gary Trowner by a thousand and twelve votes,

[02:10:01.340 --> 02:10:05.540]
Trowner held off the possibility of seeking a recon. Here's the one that just frost my ass.

[02:10:06.040 --> 02:10:10.840]
Representative William Jefferson, Democrat allusion, the guy that had the cold cash, you know, the subject of the FBI,

[02:10:10.840 --> 02:10:17.480]
that's not that Barbara investigation, the guy had 90 grand cash in his freezer is facing fellow Democrat Karen Carter and he's December 9th runoff.

[02:10:17.820 --> 02:10:23.940]
And representative Henry Bonilla, Republican Texas, face Democratic representative former Ciro Rodriguez, who's named as NZ,

[02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:33.340]
and he had unskidged for off to have no sooner than December 12th. And in Florida, a first recount was completed Tuesday in the contest for the seat of Amxius Catherine Harris,

[02:10:33.820 --> 02:10:39.420]
the Associated Press declared a winner in that race. Republican firm Buchanan leads Democrat Christine Jennings by about 400 votes,

[02:10:39.420 --> 02:10:47.640]
or less than 200 to 1%, 0.02%. Kind of 0.02, we know the programs are got numbers like that. Don't we?

[02:10:48.360 --> 02:10:49.960]
I'm sorry, I was listening to something else.

[02:10:50.780 --> 02:10:54.740]
Well, what is this? What kind of a faggy thing is it? Oh, it's from Tracy, isn't it?

[02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.560]
Yes. Oh, it's from some between. She's not a fag.

[02:10:57.860 --> 02:11:03.140]
She says, forget Brady Quinn. If you haven't seen the Swiss World Cup commercial, check it out.

[02:11:03.640 --> 02:11:10.620]
I get the lovely boy moving the hay around. And then she's got a website. I may have to check that out to a clock.

[02:11:10.760 --> 02:11:15.560]
Can you see the ice storm? Oh, that's the Gourney Weaver is brilliant in the ice storm. I love Gourney Weaver.

[02:11:16.080 --> 02:11:20.260]
And that's not a bad movie. Really? You might like it more than me. It's one of those dramas.

[02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:25.060]
What didn't you like about it? What didn't I like about it? The pace, it's kind of a morose drama.

[02:11:25.540 --> 02:11:30.460]
Don't get the judge. Don't forget bringing the talented Mr. Ripley for Josh. I want to listen to what's going to happen.

[02:11:30.460 --> 02:11:35.740]
It's a tragedy. It's very gay. But I think it's... Now you would agree with me. It's a pretty... I don't know.

[02:11:36.100 --> 02:11:40.000]
Doesn't move slowly, I wouldn't say. Mr. Ripley, doesn't it? No, no, it's good.

[02:11:40.840 --> 02:11:43.840]
I don't know. I mean, I've seen it about four times. And it's okay.

[02:11:45.140 --> 02:11:49.920]
1366, Matt Damon shows way too much tooth in it. But he always shows too much tooth. He's a little toothy kind of a guy.

[02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:55.120]
In fact, you noticed the scene there. You noticed the ripoff they did in that movie of fatal attraction.

[02:11:55.120 --> 02:12:01.680]
Remember when Glenn Close had the razor and she had the bathroom on and she was cutting herself on the leg.

[02:12:02.100 --> 02:12:09.020]
Kind of like subconsciously, because she was crazy in a bedbuck. And Mr. Ripley, Matt Damon does the same thing with the razor blade.

[02:12:09.240 --> 02:12:12.840]
Remember that? He had the blade in his pocket and then the blood is like spurting and she's like...

[02:12:13.460 --> 02:12:14.380]
Like that, fat.

[02:12:15.300 --> 02:12:18.560]
Maybe just looking at him at Tom Ripley, believe it or not.

[02:12:19.260 --> 02:12:26.760]
Matt said it's a good movie. I like it. I love the scene where the guy who was in Magnolia, the TV anchor guy, the quiz show guy.

[02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:30.680]
He's a great actor. I have no idea what his name is though. He's good and we keep forgetting.

[02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:35.600]
He plays the family attorney there, the investigator that they hire, the green leaves to.

[02:12:35.980 --> 02:12:41.700]
And he has that scene with Matt Damon on the balcony. And you think he's going to like chew him out and you know, in the whole deal.

[02:12:41.980 --> 02:12:43.180]
Because, well, I'm not going to run the movie.

[02:12:43.180 --> 02:12:47.420]
And it come to find out that he inherited all that money. That Mr. Green Leaf took a great liking to him.

[02:12:47.660 --> 02:12:49.540]
Talk about that. Rather be lucky than good, huh?

[02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:49.900]
Right.

[02:12:51.260 --> 02:12:54.860]
That's the line from Matchpoint, by the way, if you haven't seen that, rather be lucky than good.

[02:12:55.160 --> 02:12:58.260]
And he turns out to be pretty lucky. I would say in more respects than one.

[02:12:59.640 --> 02:13:01.180]
In more respects than one.

[02:13:01.300 --> 02:13:02.860]
Okay. When you come right down to it.

[02:13:03.180 --> 02:13:04.240]
He hit the jackpot.

[02:13:04.480 --> 02:13:09.720]
Because I will say this much and it rarely happens in those movies. She was a lot prettier than he was, okay?

[02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:11.000]
Yeah.

[02:13:11.760 --> 02:13:13.180]
She's pretty weird and just about anything.

[02:13:13.200 --> 02:13:17.480]
Didn't just about anything. Even Brady Quinn. Well, now, now we got a battle on our hands.

[02:13:17.720 --> 02:13:19.660]
No, we don't. Because we don't have to fight.

[02:13:19.900 --> 02:13:21.260]
That's right. I'll take care of him.

[02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:21.440]
I'll take care of him.

[02:13:21.800 --> 02:13:22.180]
Everybody's happy.

[02:13:22.560 --> 02:13:22.940]
Scarlett.

[02:13:23.300 --> 02:13:28.720]
The biggest name of the best talent to do this is Neil Rogers, sports radio 560.

[02:13:29.380 --> 02:13:30.560]
You're sorry, M.

[02:13:32.540 --> 02:13:34.640]
Why are you bastard?

[02:13:42.220 --> 02:13:48.940]
If I would step my tongue down your throat, would we read it on the front page?

[02:13:49.240 --> 02:13:49.460]
Yeah.

[02:13:49.740 --> 02:13:56.340]
N-girls don't satisfy you. I just like to try your waltz. You'll bring your lips and rangs.

[02:13:56.340 --> 02:13:57.840]
Need a cha cha cha cha.

[02:13:58.340 --> 02:13:59.360]
Y-y-y-y-y.

[02:13:59.360 --> 02:14:01.300]
Down on my knees.

[02:14:01.820 --> 02:14:02.860]
Bagging your pleas.

[02:14:03.520 --> 02:14:05.860]
A no-dare hall of mine.

[02:14:07.060 --> 02:14:10.620]
I just had enough of that martial soul.

[02:14:11.160 --> 02:14:12.980]
They even check out my behind.

[02:14:14.180 --> 02:14:15.560]
Y-y-y-y-y-y.

[02:14:16.300 --> 02:14:16.660]
Welcome.

[02:14:18.440 --> 02:14:19.780]
I know.

[02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:23.580]
It's only dated for a but a like him.

[02:14:25.880 --> 02:14:27.440]

Yes I do.

[02:14:33.880 --> 02:14:34.820]
I like him.

[02:14:35.280 --> 02:14:38.600]
But only dated for a like him.

[02:14:39.080 --> 02:14:42.480]
I only dated for a like him.

[02:14:42.900 --> 02:14:44.840]
Only dated for a like him.

[02:14:44.840 --> 02:14:44.860]
Yeah.

[02:14:45.220 --> 02:14:50.020]
I can't just say that this old boy has been a long day.

[02:14:50.020 --> 02:14:50.460]
Yeah.

[02:14:50.960 --> 02:14:51.740]
Yeah.

[02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:52.560]
I'm sad.

[02:14:53.180 --> 02:14:53.860]
I know.

[02:14:54.600 --> 02:14:57.680]
A jerry's got the show but she's not like him.

[02:14:58.080 --> 02:14:58.960]
Oh no.

[02:14:59.580 --> 02:15:01.460]
Oh it's a I know.

[02:15:01.940 --> 02:15:05.500]
We're totally like the flow when a like is.

[02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:07.960]
I only dated for a like him.

[02:15:07.960 --> 02:15:09.040]
I know.

[02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:12.680]
We were dancing in the season and we're like that.

[02:15:13.540 --> 02:15:15.600]
Only dated for a like him.

[02:15:15.840 --> 02:15:16.620]
I know.

[02:15:26.680 --> 02:15:28.080]
I know.

[02:15:33.140 --> 02:15:34.320]
I know.

[02:15:34.680 --> 02:15:34.880]
I know.

[02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:34.980]
I know.

[02:15:34.980 --> 02:15:34.980]

[02:15:34.980 --> 02:15:34.980]

[02:15:34.980 --> 02:15:34.980]

[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:35.000]

[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:35.000]

[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:35.000]

[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:35.000]

[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:35.000]

[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:35.000]

[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:35.000]

[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:35.000]

[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:35.000]

[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:35.000]

[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:35.000]

[02:15:35.520 --> 02:15:35.820]
I know.

[02:15:35.820 --> 02:15:35.820]

[02:15:35.860 --> 02:15:35.860]

[02:15:35.860 --> 02:15:35.860]

[02:15:35.860 --> 02:15:35.860]

[02:15:35.960 --> 02:15:36.220]
I know.

[02:15:37.400 --> 02:15:37.400]

[02:15:37.440 --> 02:15:37.800]
I know.

[02:15:38.440 --> 02:15:39.160]
I know.

[02:15:42.520 --> 02:15:43.180]
I know.

[02:15:43.920 --> 02:15:44.420]
I know.

[02:15:49.180 --> 02:15:50.220]
Yeah.

[02:15:50.220 --> 02:15:50.220]

[02:15:50.220 --> 02:15:51.100]
I know.

[02:15:51.100 --> 02:15:51.100]

[02:15:51.100 --> 02:15:51.100]

[02:15:51.100 --> 02:15:51.100]

[02:15:51.100 --> 02:15:51.420]
And I really know.

[02:15:52.680 --> 02:15:52.820]
I know.

[02:15:52.820 --> 02:15:53.180]
And I know.

[02:15:53.180 --> 02:15:53.180]

[02:15:53.180 --> 02:15:53.180]

[02:15:53.180 --> 02:15:56.420]
Good morning.

[02:15:57.880 --> 02:15:57.880]

[02:15:57.880 --> 02:15:57.880]

[02:15:57.880 --> 02:15:58.400]
Thank you spirit.

[02:15:58.500 --> 02:15:59.100]
Good morning.

[02:15:59.120 --> 02:15:59.200]
Good morning.

[02:15:59.200 --> 02:15:59.200]

[02:15:59.560 --> 02:16:00.760]
Good evening.

[02:16:01.520 --> 02:16:02.840]
Good morning.

[02:16:03.340 --> 02:16:07.960]
You're working hard, right?

[02:16:07.960 --> 02:16:07.960]

[02:16:07.960 --> 02:16:07.960]

[02:16:10.960 --> 02:16:11.120]
Too many stuff to be done.

[02:16:11.120 --> 02:16:11.120]

[02:16:11.120 --> 02:16:14.400]
From yesterday at WCT L away is coming up.

[02:16:14.400 --> 02:16:14.400]

[02:16:14.400 --> 02:16:17.040]
big wedding countdown in Italy.

[02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:18.140]
It's a prime demand.

[02:16:18.440 --> 02:16:19.640]
And Tomcat, we don't care.

[02:16:20.200 --> 02:16:21.380]
Hey, don't you guys believe it now?

[02:16:21.520 --> 02:16:21.840]
Look at him.

[02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:22.940]
No, we don't.

[02:16:22.940 --> 02:16:23.420]
Hey, Tommy.

[02:16:23.700 --> 02:16:24.180]
You ferry.

[02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:26.020]
The documents which have long been taught

[02:16:26.020 --> 02:16:28.260]
to exist by observers and critics of America's national

[02:16:28.260 --> 02:16:31.140]
security policies were confirmed to exist as the result

[02:16:31.140 --> 02:16:33.340]
of a still pending feed-me-information act

[02:16:33.340 --> 02:16:34.860]
lawsuit by the ACLU.

[02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:38.080]
One of these documents is believed to be a companion piece

[02:16:38.080 --> 02:16:41.520]
to the now infamous August 2002 memorandum, which redefined

[02:16:41.520 --> 02:16:44.300]
torture and as a result, broadened the range of interrogations

[02:16:44.300 --> 02:16:45.780]
and tactics permitted in the field.

[02:16:46.240 --> 02:16:49.540]
The companion document, the so-called U2 document named

[02:16:49.540 --> 02:16:52.760]
after legal counsel, John U, is believed to contain a list

[02:16:52.760 --> 02:16:54.540]
of actual techniques that have been approved by the Department

[02:16:54.540 --> 02:16:56.800]
of Justice, and which therefore are legally protected

[02:16:56.800 --> 02:16:59.420]
interrogation methods used by intelligence operatives

[02:16:59.420 --> 02:17:00.720]
against suspected terrorists.

[02:17:01.540 --> 02:17:03.980]
A press release issue today contends that Leahy had previously

[02:17:03.980 --> 02:17:06.460]
requested all documents related to the treatment of detainees

[02:17:06.460 --> 02:17:08.640]
from the Department of Justice, the FBI, the CIA,

[02:17:08.660 --> 02:17:10.040]
and the Department of Defense.

[02:17:10.780 --> 02:17:12.800]
These requests have turned up numerous controversial

[02:17:12.800 --> 02:17:15.280]
memos and reports detailing the handling of so-called

[02:17:15.280 --> 02:17:17.960]
enemy combatants by US soldiers and intelligence officials,

[02:17:17.960 --> 02:17:19.960]
but now uncovered documents were never included.

[02:17:20.360 --> 02:17:22.660]
According to the ACLU, the document specifies interrogation

[02:17:22.660 --> 02:17:25.140]
methods that the CIA may use against top al-Qaeda members.

[02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:28.440]
Last November, a news report surfaced detailing six

[02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:30.200]
so-called enhanced interrogation techniques,

[02:17:30.580 --> 02:17:32.760]
what remains unclear in what the documents requested by Leahy

[02:17:32.760 --> 02:17:35.320]
might reveal is what among these documents, which are

[02:17:35.320 --> 02:17:36.860]
legal in the eyes of the Justice Department.

[02:17:37.120 --> 02:17:38.600]
You don't like the waterboarding and stuff like that.

[02:17:39.660 --> 02:17:42.260]
And poking their eyes out and yanking their fingernails off,

[02:17:42.260 --> 02:17:43.160]
things like that.

[02:17:43.280 --> 02:17:45.640]
Just minor little encouragement to answer the freaking question.

[02:17:45.820 --> 02:17:46.280]
Stuff like that.

[02:17:46.760 --> 02:17:47.380]
Got it?

[02:17:47.380 --> 02:17:47.740]
Good.

[02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:50.360]
1381.

[02:17:50.580 --> 02:17:51.020]
Oh, look at that.

[02:17:51.060 --> 02:17:52.880]
Oh, we got the whole rest of the hour for crying out loud.

[02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:53.900]
It's only 20 after one.

[02:17:53.980 --> 02:17:54.480]
My God.

[02:17:56.580 --> 02:17:58.540]
Not that it's a Friday or anything like that.

[02:17:58.980 --> 02:17:59.820]
Not that we've had a little bit.

[02:18:00.180 --> 02:18:02.080]
Although it isn't nice having that nice new light bulb there.

[02:18:02.260 --> 02:18:02.520]
Not good?

[02:18:03.200 --> 02:18:03.880]
I'm glad you got it.

[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:04.280]
I'm glad you read it.

[02:18:04.400 --> 02:18:06.420]
I'm trying to read here without stumbling and fumbling

[02:18:06.420 --> 02:18:08.160]
and bumping because, and especially when you send me

[02:18:08.160 --> 02:18:11.080]
those factions or those stories, I got a little teeny tiny

[02:18:11.080 --> 02:18:12.100]
20 minute and faded.

[02:18:12.720 --> 02:18:13.460]
Those are my favorite.

[02:18:15.120 --> 02:18:16.400]
1381, Rupert Murdoch is one.

[02:18:16.500 --> 02:18:17.920]
Even though that pulled me up there all weekend long.

[02:18:18.220 --> 02:18:19.780]
I almost feel like we ought to change it

[02:18:20.120 --> 02:18:22.680]
because it's a non-compassmentous weeness.

[02:18:22.780 --> 02:18:23.080]
You know what I mean?

[02:18:23.400 --> 02:18:24.020]
But I'm gonna leave it.

[02:18:24.520 --> 02:18:25.480]
Why the hell do we want to do that?

[02:18:25.620 --> 02:18:27.020]
And by the way, Sean, thanks for the polls.

[02:18:27.160 --> 02:18:28.620]
But before I show up, I'm gonna feature you to do better

[02:18:28.620 --> 02:18:28.980]
than this.

[02:18:29.640 --> 02:18:31.180]
You see the three polls he's got on here?

[02:18:31.660 --> 02:18:32.280]
Actually, I did not.

[02:18:32.740 --> 02:18:33.620]
Look, don't, don't.

[02:18:33.740 --> 02:18:34.120]
You'll be depressed.

[02:18:34.320 --> 02:18:36.340]
And then there's Steve sent us in a poll idea too.

[02:18:36.680 --> 02:18:39.060]
Which group of people scare you the most just by the way

[02:18:39.060 --> 02:18:39.500]
they look?

[02:18:40.220 --> 02:18:42.000]
And he says hip hop gangsters,

[02:18:42.360 --> 02:18:44.340]
Husset and Jews, and I love the way he's spelled it.

[02:18:44.400 --> 02:18:47.580]
Amish people, priests, black women with short blonde hair.

[02:18:48.360 --> 02:18:50.720]
So I won't get any votes, but they scare the crap out of me

[02:18:50.720 --> 02:18:51.440]
is what Steve said.

[02:18:51.860 --> 02:18:53.020]
What do you think about that poll?

[02:18:53.640 --> 02:18:54.540]
I think that's a good idea.

[02:18:54.800 --> 02:18:56.920]
I mean, we can add some things, change some things.

[02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:57.980]
Yeah, I think he's got to go up here.

[02:18:57.980 --> 02:18:59.000]
Well, give me some ideas to it.

[02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:01.220]
Okay, maybe I'm not gonna, it's for Monday anyway.

[02:19:01.340 --> 02:19:02.000]
We're not gonna do that.

[02:19:02.040 --> 02:19:03.480]
Oh yeah, like I said, give me some ideas.

[02:19:03.880 --> 02:19:05.460]
Oh, I got to know, when I see blind people driving.

[02:19:06.080 --> 02:19:06.380]
Okay.

[02:19:06.480 --> 02:19:07.180]
Scares the hell out of me.

[02:19:07.600 --> 02:19:10.780]
Like I said, I'll leave it in my capable hands.

[02:19:12.340 --> 02:19:13.540]
23 passed one again.

[02:19:13.660 --> 02:19:15.600]
Thanks to our friends at Jackson's ice cream parlor and Dany.

[02:19:15.600 --> 02:19:17.200]
You beat, don't forget their big 50th anniversary

[02:19:17.700 --> 02:19:18.640]
batches tomorrow night.

[02:19:19.080 --> 02:19:21.060]
And George and Josh are swooning, man.

[02:19:21.340 --> 02:19:23.420]
Josh is already made a quick run.

[02:19:24.380 --> 02:19:27.340]
Now is that run as in singular or runs as in well anyway?

[02:19:27.580 --> 02:19:28.060]
No, singular.

[02:19:28.420 --> 02:19:28.640]
Good.

[02:19:29.020 --> 02:19:30.960]
Well, when I said runs as in, I wasn't talking about plural.

[02:19:31.300 --> 02:19:32.380]
I was talking about as in a noun.

[02:19:33.360 --> 02:19:35.600]
Perhaps it wasn't the best day for former Senator George

[02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:37.620]
McGovern to bring his case for pulling US troops out of

[02:19:37.620 --> 02:19:39.020]
Iraq to Democrats on Capitol Hill.

[02:19:39.240 --> 02:19:41.880]
With Democrats starting a contentious caucus to elect new

[02:19:41.880 --> 02:19:43.960]
leaders for the return to the majority status in January,

[02:19:44.200 --> 02:19:46.520]
less than a dozen members of the progressive caucus

[02:19:46.520 --> 02:19:49.280]
met with McGovern and Professor William R. Polk

[02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:51.740]
of the University of Chicago who have written out of Iraq

[02:19:51.740 --> 02:19:53.620]
a practical plan for withdrawal now.

[02:19:54.400 --> 02:19:56.360]
I'll bet you two thirds of the American people think that

[02:19:56.360 --> 02:19:57.820]
this is a, this war was a mistake.

[02:19:58.160 --> 02:20:00.580]
Just like 95% of Americans think they had not was a mistake.

[02:20:00.660 --> 02:20:02.920]
McGovern said in poking his own history as the Democrats

[02:20:02.920 --> 02:20:06.400]
anti-war candidate who failed miserably in his 1972 bid

[02:20:06.400 --> 02:20:07.760]
to one seat president Nixon.

[02:20:08.360 --> 02:20:10.860]
Now my memory may be bad, but it seems to me that McGovern

[02:20:10.860 --> 02:20:15.400]
won Massachusetts and I think he won two states in 72.

[02:20:16.160 --> 02:20:16.580]
Not good.

[02:20:17.140 --> 02:20:19.580]
Recalling Nixon's famous speech about the silent majority

[02:20:19.580 --> 02:20:21.000]
who he said supported the war in Vietnam

[02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.520]
as opposed to the vocal anti-war demonstrators who marched

[02:20:23.520 --> 02:20:25.140]
into the country cities and on college campuses,

[02:20:25.660 --> 02:20:27.960]
ABC checked the former South Dakota senators numbers.

[02:20:28.540 --> 02:20:30.600]
McGovern was close in something up to the disdain for Iraq,

[02:20:30.600 --> 02:20:32.480]
but a little further off the mark about Vietnam.

[02:20:33.240 --> 02:20:36.560]
In a November 5th Gallup poll 55% called Iraq war mistake.

[02:20:36.840 --> 02:20:40.640]
Similarly 57% in the ABC post-poll October 22th

[02:20:40.640 --> 02:20:41.960]
said the war was not worth fighting.

[02:20:42.700 --> 02:20:44.940]
Gallup last asked about Vietnam being a mistake in 2000

[02:20:44.940 --> 02:20:47.900]
and at that time 69% of the public said it was a mistake.

[02:20:48.200 --> 02:20:50.260]
During the war the number of colleagues in the mistake

[02:20:50.260 --> 02:20:53.460]
picked at 60 in 1971, 60% and 73.

[02:20:53.880 --> 02:20:56.060]
Since then it picked at 74% in 1990.

[02:20:56.580 --> 02:20:58.420]
That's the, see that, what does that tell you

[02:20:58.420 --> 02:20:59.240]
about the American public?

[02:21:01.020 --> 02:21:03.960]
58,000 American troops came home in body bags,

[02:21:03.960 --> 02:21:06.860]
millions of innocent Vietnamese people died

[02:21:06.860 --> 02:21:09.540]
and there was no reason for us to be there in the first place

[02:21:10.060 --> 02:21:12.660]
and it picked at 74% in 1990.

[02:21:13.440 --> 02:21:15.700]
This election on November 7th told us that the Democrats

[02:21:15.700 --> 02:21:17.800]
in this country are waiting, that the people in this country

[02:21:17.800 --> 02:21:19.600]
are waiting for Jim Baker to tell the Democrats

[02:21:19.600 --> 02:21:20.760]
where we should go in a rec said,

[02:21:21.020 --> 02:21:22.520]
representative Lynn Woolsey at California,

[02:21:22.520 --> 02:21:24.020]
who chairs the progressive caucus,

[02:21:24.540 --> 02:21:25.920]
referring to the former Secretary of State,

[02:21:26.180 --> 02:21:27.640]
who's one of the leaders of the Iraq study group,

[02:21:27.900 --> 02:21:28.640]
Jim Baker who said,

[02:21:28.640 --> 02:21:30.380]
F the Jews they don't vote for us anyway.

[02:21:30.980 --> 02:21:32.640]
The people of America spoke on November 7th,

[02:21:32.660 --> 02:21:34.720]
Woolsey said that they know how we're supposed to leave Iraq,

[02:21:34.920 --> 02:21:36.820]
no, that they want us to leave, yes.

[02:21:37.400 --> 02:21:38.640]
The government told reporters yesterday

[02:21:38.640 --> 02:21:40.320]
hasn't spoken formally with the study group,

[02:21:40.420 --> 02:21:42.080]
the independent bipartisan commission led by Baker

[02:21:42.080 --> 02:21:44.040]
and former Democratic Congressman Lee Hamilton,

[02:21:44.300 --> 02:21:46.100]
but said he has spoken with individual members

[02:21:46.820 --> 02:21:48.100]
and partridge in a pair of trees,

[02:21:48.240 --> 02:21:49.980]
but a meat but a boot but a bop and yadi,adi,adi.

[02:21:51.600 --> 02:21:53.640]
It's one of those things, man, it's like a bad marriage.

[02:21:53.980 --> 02:21:55.100]
It wasn't that hard to get in,

[02:21:55.300 --> 02:21:57.180]
but boy, your cheer was a mess trying to get out.

[02:21:57.520 --> 02:21:57.820]
Yeah.

[02:21:58.340 --> 02:22:00.140]
I'm not, no, I didn't have anybody specific in mind,

[02:22:00.140 --> 02:22:01.440]
necessarily, although,

[02:22:01.720 --> 02:22:03.240]
oh, I know who I was thinking of before,

[02:22:03.380 --> 02:22:05.620]
Margot Kitter, boy, she bugs the crap out of me.

[02:22:06.100 --> 02:22:07.300]
Yeah, she is a newbie.

[02:22:07.380 --> 02:22:09.140]
I can't think of what movie I just seen her in the other,

[02:22:09.240 --> 02:22:10.920]
but she part of all those Superman movies

[02:22:10.920 --> 02:22:12.280]
which would have been adequate.

[02:22:12.780 --> 02:22:15.160]
Yeah, otherwise, extraordinarily annoying.

[02:22:15.360 --> 02:22:18.060]
Is Margot freaking, are you kidding me?

[02:22:18.360 --> 02:22:19.440]
Last and the broad thing,

[02:22:19.700 --> 02:22:20.740]
what's the best talent?

[02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:21.700]
Please, not again.

[02:22:21.780 --> 02:22:24.320]
You're Roger and I'm going for it's radio 560.

[02:22:24.600 --> 02:22:25.760]

Friday, you bastard.

[02:22:32.360 --> 02:22:34.400]
Oh, I'll be helping you today.

[02:22:35.040 --> 02:22:37.360]
Hey, would you please be having a blue slurping?

[02:22:37.700 --> 02:22:39.400]
We are having a sail on camera.

[02:22:39.580 --> 02:22:40.520]
R-H-E-G.

[02:22:40.580 --> 02:22:42.160]
We have had about many flavors.

[02:22:43.080 --> 02:22:44.800]
I'm afraid that there's not any more.

[02:22:45.540 --> 02:22:48.080]
R-H-E-G-H-E-A-D-A.

[02:22:48.180 --> 02:22:49.780]
Okay, I'll tell you everything.

[02:22:50.680 --> 02:22:53.060]
I just can't make me proud for the inside that you think.

[02:22:53.320 --> 02:22:55.520]
Hey, you guys just threw it with a wimp in the bag.

[02:22:55.520 --> 02:22:58.200]
It is only because they smell so bad.

[02:22:58.400 --> 02:23:00.740]
You can name a group of reactions of a group

[02:23:00.740 --> 02:23:02.220]
and we don't wanna stink out of it.

[02:23:02.220 --> 02:23:03.280]
We smell like a fool.

[02:23:03.560 --> 02:23:04.780]
R-H-E-G-H-A-D-A.

[02:23:04.780 --> 02:23:05.600]

well Italy doesn't recognize Scientology is a religion and other reason I love Italy

dreams that work I don't think I have time to read this it's too long but I'm gonna do it

[02:25:00.340 --> 02:25:04.340]
anyway he says the American media establishment has launched a major offensive against the

[02:25:04.340 --> 02:25:07.900]
option with drawing US troops from Iraq in the latest media assault right wing outfits

[02:25:07.900 --> 02:25:11.840]
like Fox News in the Wall Street Journal editorial page our secondary the heaviest fire

[02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:15.460]
power is now coming from most valuable square inches of media real estate in the USA the

[02:25:15.460 --> 02:25:19.720]
front page of the New York Times the present situation is grimly instructive for anyone

[02:25:19.720 --> 02:25:23.700]
who might wonder how the Vietnam more could continue for years while opinionful show

[02:25:23.700 --> 02:25:27.620]
that most Americans were against it now in the wake of intermolecions widely seen as

[02:25:27.620 --> 02:25:32.140]
a rebuked to the Iraq war powerful media institutions are feverously spinning against a pull

[02:25:32.140 --> 02:25:36.880]
out of US troops under the headline get out of Iraq now question mark not so fast experts

[02:25:36.880 --> 02:25:41.080]
say the November 15 front page of the New York Times primarily featured a military analysis

[02:25:41.080 --> 02:25:45.100]
by Michael Gordon the piece reported that while some congressional Democrats are saying

[02:25:45.100 --> 02:25:48.780]
withdrawal US troops should begin within four to six months this argument is being challenged

[02:25:48.780 --> 02:25:52.260]
by a number of military officers experts and former generals including some of them

[02:25:52.260 --> 02:25:55.860]
among the most vehement critics of the Bush administrations of Iraq policies reporter

[02:25:55.860 --> 02:26:00.460]
Gordon appeared hours later on Anderson Cooper CNN show fully morphing into an unbashed

[02:26:00.460 --> 02:26:05.100]
pundit as he declared that withdrawal is simply not realistic sounding much like a pentagon

[02:26:05.100 --> 02:26:09.240]
spokesman Gordon went on to state and no uncertain terms that he opposes a pullout if

[02:26:09.240 --> 02:26:12.780]
a New York Times military affairs reported one on the TV to advocate for withdrawal of US

[02:26:12.780 --> 02:26:16.840]
troops as unequivocally as Gordon advocated against any such withdrawal during his appearance

[02:26:16.840 --> 02:26:20.580]
the November 15 on CNN he or she would be quickly reprimanded and probably would have

[02:26:20.580 --> 02:26:24.700]
been taken off the beat by the Times hierarchy but the papers news department eagerly fussed

[02:26:24.700 --> 02:26:29.120]
as reporting that internalizes and promotes the basic worldviews of the country's national

[02:26:29.120 --> 02:26:33.920]
security state that's how and why the Times front page was so hospital rolled to the work

[02:26:33.920 --> 02:26:37.600]
of Judith Miller during the lead up to the invasion of Iraq that's how and why the Times

[02:26:37.600 --> 02:26:41.580]
is now so hospitable to the work of Michael Gordon at this point categories like vehement

[02:26:41.580 --> 02:26:45.740]
critics of the Bush administrations Iraq policies are virtually meaningless the bulk of

[02:26:45.740 --> 02:26:49.360]
the media's favorite vehement critics are opposed to reduction of US involvement in the

[02:26:49.360 --> 02:26:53.060]
Iraq carnage and some of them are now openly urging an increase in US troop levels for

[02:26:53.060 --> 02:26:57.500]
the occupation these days media coverage of US policy in Iraq often seems to be little

[02:26:57.500 --> 02:27:01.080]
more than a remake of how mainstream news outlets portrayed Washington's options during

[02:27:01.080 --> 02:27:05.000]
the war in Vietnam routine difference to inside the beltway conventional wisdom as to

[02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:09.500]
many prominent journalists to do co-producers of a groundhog day sequel that insists the

[02:27:09.500 --> 02:27:13.520]
West war effort must go on during the year since the fall of sawdum countless news stories

[02:27:13.520 --> 02:27:17.340]
and commentate commentaries have compared the ongoing disaster in Iraq to the Vietnam war

[02:27:17.340 --> 02:27:21.120]
but those comparisons have early illuminated the most troubling parallels between the US

[02:27:21.120 --> 02:27:27.040]
media coverage of both wars whether in 1986 or 68 or 2006 most of the Washington press

[02:27:27.040 --> 02:27:30.800]
score has been at pains to portray with the role of US troops as impractical and unrealistic

[02:27:31.300 --> 02:27:34.580]
contrary to myths about media coverage of the Vietnam more the American press lagged

[02:27:34.580 --> 02:27:38.620]
way behind grassroots anti-war sentiment in seriously contemplating US pull out from

[02:27:38.620 --> 02:27:42.800]
Vietnam the lag time amounted to several years and meant the additional deaths of tens

[02:27:42.800 --> 02:27:47.380]
of thousands of Americans and perhaps a million more more Vietnamese people a survey by the

[02:27:47.380 --> 02:27:51.980]
Boston Globe conducted in February 68 found that out of 39 major daily newspapers in the

[02:27:51.980 --> 02:27:55.880]
West not a single one had to realize for withdrawing American troops from Vietnam today

[02:27:55.880 --> 02:27:59.880]
despite the anti-war tilt of national opinion polls in the recent election advocacy of

[02:27:59.880 --> 02:28:05.080]
US pull out from Iraq seems almost as scarce among modern day media elites the standard media

[02:28:05.080 --> 02:28:09.000]
evasions about to kicking the bloody can down the road careful statements about benchmarks

[02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:12.760]
and getting tough with the Baghdad government as with the Saigon government are markers for

[02:28:12.760 --> 02:28:17.200]
a national media disclosure that dodges instead of in life in its debate many journalists are

[02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:21.000]
retreading the notion that the pull out option is not a real option at all and the Democrats

[02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:25.100]
will soon be running Congress were told wouldn't and shouldn't there go that far if they

[02:28:25.100 --> 02:28:29.240]
knew what's good for them implicit in such media coverage is the idea that the real legitimacy

[02:28:29.240 --> 02:28:33.520]
for US pot war policy making rest with the president not the Congress when I ponder that

[02:28:33.520 --> 02:28:38.480]
assumption I think about 42 year old footage of the CBS program face the nation the shows host

[02:28:38.480 --> 02:28:42.780]
on that 64 telecast was the widely esteemed journalist Peter Lissagore who told his guest

[02:28:42.780 --> 02:28:47.080]
senator the constitution gives the president the west the sole responsibility for the conduct

[02:28:47.080 --> 02:28:51.700]
of foreign policy you couldn't be more wrong senator Wayne Morse broken with his sandpaper

[02:28:52.340 --> 02:28:55.820]
you could make a more unsound legal statement than the one you've just made this is the

[02:28:55.820 --> 02:28:59.940]
promulgation of an old fallacy that foreign policy belongs to the president and that's nonsense

[02:29:00.400 --> 02:29:04.440]
Lissagore was almost taught in his he asked to whom does it belong then senator Morse didn't

[02:29:04.440 --> 02:29:07.960]
miss a beat it belongs to the American people he shot back and I'm pleading that the American

[02:29:07.960 --> 02:29:12.340]
people be given the facts about foreign policy the journalist persisted you know senator that the

[02:29:12.340 --> 02:29:17.340]
American people can't formulate an execute foreign policy Morse's response was indignant why do

[02:29:17.340 --> 02:29:21.080]
you say that I've complete faith in the ability the American people to follow the facts if you'll

[02:29:21.080 --> 02:29:24.740]
give them to them and my charge against my government is we're not giving the American people the

[02:29:24.740 --> 02:29:29.560]
facts Morse the senate senior senator from Oregon was passionate about the U.S. Constitution as

[02:29:29.560 --> 02:29:33.260]
well as international law and while rejecting the widely held notion that foreign policy belongs

[02:29:33.260 --> 02:29:37.580]
to the president he spoke an unflinching terms about the Vietnamese war at a hearing of the

[02:29:37.580 --> 02:29:42.000]
Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 2768 Morse said they did not intend to put the

[02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:46.700]
blood of this war on his hands and prophetically he added we're going to become guilty in my judgment

[02:29:46.700 --> 02:29:51.060]
of being the greatest threat to the peace of the world it's an ugly reality and we Americans don't

[02:29:51.060 --> 02:29:56.620]
like to face up to it he said almost 40 years ago and we're still doing the same crap Norman
