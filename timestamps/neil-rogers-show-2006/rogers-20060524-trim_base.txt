[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.500]
What a game last night.

[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.080]
Yeah.

[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.400]
Yeah.

[00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.920]
What game are you talking about?

[00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.360]
Adventure and the Anaheim.

[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.060]
That's what I thought.

[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.640]
Yeah.

[00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.680]
Incredible game.

[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.720]
Eight goals in the third period.

[00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.340]
Yeah.

[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.180]
This one looked like the Orders are going to blow them out and it was for nothing.

[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.800]
All of us in Anaheim's stage is great.

[00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.160]
Come back.

[00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.780]
If they wouldn't have given away a really careless greasy goal, they'd still be playing.

[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:28.460]
That was a great game.

[00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.040]
I'm not talking about that crap.

[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.380]
I could care less about that.

[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.380]
You're not going to, you're not going to like, I've got more important things to tell you.

[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.940]
Yes.

[00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.460]
You know, remember I told you yesterday about the salespeople who were sitting around watching

[00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.540]
your show while you were in Baltimore?

[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.220]
Yes.

[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.220]
Looking into an empty studio and they wanted to do the same with me while I'm sitting up here in Toronto.

[00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.660]
Yeah.

[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.040]
Well, I find out just minutes ago, just moments ago, this will send you into orbit.

[00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.640]
You know how Monday, next Monday is Memorial Day and of course you're not working on the area.

[00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.000]
No.

[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:55.960]
No, I need to remind.

[00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.420]
But George is, because at least one thing about us, you know, whether if I'm not here, then George is.

[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.160]
At least we try to maintain some continuity and put on a show as opposed to just, you know,

[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.320]
dragging somebody out from a dumpster and putting them on here.

[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.880]
Well, come to find out that Todd Dreck, who is the most, I'm going to hire a hitman for Todd Dreck.

[00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.900]
And you know, next time you start your car, Todd, I'd be real careful.

[00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.280]
Okay.

[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.140]
I'd be real cautious.

[00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:25.200]
If you're like any hissing sound or smelly smoke, this little son of a bitch was going to take one of his car dealer responses.

[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.240]
And he was going to have the big old, he requested for the big old to do a noon to four remote that they were going to do on a Saturday,

[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.380]
but it got bumped or something.

[00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:38.480]
So he was going to take four hours, including two hours of our show, meaning me and George and stick it in there.

[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.080]
Well, Todd stick it.

[00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.580]
And of course, as usual, he didn't go to clearance with us.

[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.300]
He had Chris Jones, the sales manager, go to clearance just like he hadn't come to me last week about some account that we didn't want to do.

[00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.860]
Just a little, I'm telling you man, a sales department we need in an enemy in that place.

[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.000]
We need a big gigantic blueberry animal.

[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.900]
It's unbelievable what's going on there.

[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.760]
It's scandalous.

[00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.500]
It is absolutely scandalous.

[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.780]
I've been in the business for 140 years and every time you think you've seen rock bottom of these people find a new bottom.

[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.700]
It was so despicable.

[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.960]
It's amazing.

[00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.340]
Can you imagine that?

[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.780]
I've never heard anything like that.

[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.900]
No, neither of I.

[00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.440]
I mean, they don't, they see, I said the Clarence is now saying, you know, maybe this goes with the what's going on between two and four.

[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.060]
Like we don't have any, we're free form radio, you know, just show off whatever you feel like it.

[00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.900]
And maybe we'll put you on and put on what the sales department wants us to put on.

[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.320]
Evidently, Evidently, they're calling all the shots now.

[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.060]
This new Yahoo from North Carolina rubber.

[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.340]
He's from, he's calling the shots.

[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.960]
There's nothing to do with the formats.

[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.100]
There's nothing to do with anything that we want to do or endorse or believe in.

[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.120]
It just has to do with whoever's got any cash out there that they can grab a hold of.

[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.420]
They'll put it on the air.

[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.840]
It's like we're maybe we can like start bartering the time like you know on the KET like they do.

[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.080]
Like they used to do across the street before they put that crap on here.

[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.080]
What do you think?

[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.520]
And then today between noon and 1230, which we got the early Marlon pregame at 1230.

[00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.760]
Right.

[00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.680]
We got three breaks in a half hour.

[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.980]
I don't think I've ever had over all the years I've been on here had three breaks in a half an hour.

[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.140]
But you know something we'll get them in.

[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.520]
If I have to do them all back to back it because we're, I told you before, we're not all sports radio.

[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.540]
We're all sports radio.

[00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.280]
And this new guy they brought in, he's determined to make that happen.

[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.080]
Yeah, we had, I had a nine minute break today.

[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.720]
Beauty.

[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.800]
But actually be really good for the audience.

[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:20.060]
Yeah.

[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.620]
Good for length, a list of ship.

[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.540]
Unbelievable.

[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.780]
Nine minute break.

[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.420]
We're back to like the worst team breaks again.

[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.460]
They never learn their lesson, man.

[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.720]
These people are just a bunch of horrors.

[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.420]
That's all they are.

[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.000]
You know the banjo boy group bank.

[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.240]
They're just a bunch of horrors.

[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.120]
Just hooring the frequencies and just sucking up as much cash as they can.

[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.460]
I just like everybody in the media.

[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.440]
You know that's that's all we are now glorified.

[00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.900]
Kathy Willitz's.

[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.840]
So about the without the freckles.

[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.540]
I was going to tell you about the slot machines.

[00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.460]
It was in there.

[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.840]
I got to tell you what do you mean you were going to tell me about it.

[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.200]
Don't you think I'm way ahead of you?

[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.640]
And that's also very depressing.

[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.440]
Good God.

[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.820]
You talk about slow.

[00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.700]
What the hell are these people waiting for?

[00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.620]
You were telling me July.

[00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.720]
And remember I kept saying you'd be able what year?

[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.340]
The ringing and clang.

[00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.700]
You talking about the Sunsendle story?

[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.100]
Yeah.

[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.200]
The ringing and clang your slots is likely to be heard and brought by Labor Day.

[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.620]
Labor Day last time I checked it in September.

[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.120]
Yeah.

[00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.220]
Well one of the places is going to be ready to go.

[00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.280]
I guess Hollywood Dark Tracker or whatever they're calling it now.

[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.140]
Morty Grown.

[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.800]
Morty Grown will be ready in August.

[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.080]
And no stream will be ready Labor Day.

[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:22.760]
And Pompato Park.

[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.860]
Pompato that sounds like it's going to be not going to be ready for early next year.

[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.420]

[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.940]
Well, I'll say eons.

[00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.940]
Unless you want to blow that account down.

[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.600]
The rain will only hit him on the air 30 years.

[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.940]
When he said you like what's taking him so long?

[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.340]
I guess they're waiting to build a plan.

[00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.140]
Well they had their original plans, you know.

[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.300]
And then of course they had all that damage with the hurricane.

[00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.040]
And then of course your fat ass governor and legislatures put the big stall routine on.

[00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.660]
So they had to start from scratch and we redesigned the whole thing all over again.

[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.080]
The supplies and this date will be taxed at a higher rate than any place in the country.

[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.500]
Right.

[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.960]
Just to try to make sure that it fails.

[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.460]
That's correct.

[00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:57.960]
That's your fat ass governor.

[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.620]
Who now?

[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.940]
They're propping him up to be the next commissioner of the NFL.

[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.780]
Do you think that story?

[00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.980]
That is the biggest bag of crap.

[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:04.620]
Yes.

[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.120]
No, it's the second biggest after Orlando Alza query doing a remote mom Monday from noon to four or five thirty.

[00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.740]
There's as much chance that the big O is going to be taken over part of the show Monday or any other day.

[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.100]
And there is a view walking out the door today and finding 80 million dollars in cash and small bills.

[00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.120]
And a little refrigerator in the other room there.

[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.180]
I think I'll go look.

[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.260]
Yeah, look in the freezer.

[00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:24.980]
Maybe Bill Jefferson's got some.

[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.680]
Maybe somebody's head is in the freezer.

[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.160]
Yeah, maybe.

[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.920]
Maybe Jimmy Hoff is in the freezer.

[00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.680]
Todd Drake.

[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.440]
Oh, brother.

[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.660]
Don't tempt me, man.

[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.560]
Members, Jeffrey Dahmer, body parts in the freezer.

[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:37.700]
I think that's Todd Dreck.

[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.520]
If I can just see it now.

[00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.780]
Dreck in the freezer.

[00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:42.100]
Remember that song?

[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.560]
Smoke on the water by Deep Purple.

[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.280]
I can see it now.

[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.740]
Dreck in the freezer.

[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.700]
I can see it.

[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:48.540]
I can write it.

[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:49.880]
I have Bokobrion recorded.

[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.500]
Chicken neck.

[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.480]
Oh, man.

[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.000]
He is just one of the most evil little people who ever came down the pike.

[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.940]
Oh, God.

[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.060]
Of any size.

[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.620]
And always hiding behind somebody else's purse strings.

[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.920]
Always hiding behind screw in and now he hides behind Chris Jones.

[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.960]
And oh, could I get you to do this?

[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.260]
Come on.

[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.620]
You jackass.

[00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.740]
God, do I hate him.

[00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.480]
I just like to update the copy once in a while.

[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.660]
That's all.

[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.640]
You're in La La.

[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:15.460]
You must be.

[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.500]
You may be George shared some of his medication with you yesterday because what's going on.

[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.140]
Since this new guy came in here, it was bad enough before we don't get any new copy.

[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.420]
We just have the same.

[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.660]
It's just where we're as stale as last year's Halifah, man.

[00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:28.440]
It's just unbelievable.

[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.540]
And of course, they're not into that part of it.

[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.420]
So they're just into writing business, desperate, desperation.

[00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.460]
When did your summer schedule start?

[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:37.980]
No, not soon enough.

[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.340]
Not soon enough at about three and a half weeks.

[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.920]
And boy, I'm telling you, I'm counting the minutes.

[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.440]
Isn't it amazing to you that these, I mean, I asked yesterday, maybe I should ask you every day.

[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:52.860]
Maybe you'll forget to tell me that there's some great exciting new development that you forgot to talk to you about.

[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.860]
I just come into the show.

[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.880]
I do the show and I go home.

[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.440]
Although today at 12.30, I'll be all dressed and out the door.

[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:04.380]
I'll be on my way.

[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:05.840]
You had an extra time there.

[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:06.340]
That's okay.

[00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:07.540]
Looking for a good machine.

[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.980]
Oh, yeah, no complaints about that.

[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.740]
And George, of course, had mixed feelings about that thing on Monday because he'd, you know,

[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.880]
he'd like to get off of there and do it.

[00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.680]
So I think it's a phenomenal idea.

[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.540]
Far be it for us to stand in the way of the station, making a buck.

[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:20.480]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:21.400]
Yeah.

[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.940]
I mean, obviously, I haven't gotten them good ratings, they have years.

[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:26.720]
I made them any money.

[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.740]
So, you know, this, this show is basically, you know, at their convenience and pleasure.

[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.160]
When they have nothing else to put on here, they'll put this show on.

[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:38.300]
Like when Stern went and signed that illegal deal, you know, and left over into this show, which they were already,

[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.860]
it's like selling a house that you don't own or selling it to two different people.

[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:42.960]
You know what I mean?

[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.460]
I know what you mean.

[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.700]
These people belong, I think they belong in, in, in Rayford.

[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.860]
They belong in Stark.

[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.940]
Very Mackerel's Sparky, man, fire that baby up and just line up the whole, the whole beastly clan.

[00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.360]
All of it before the beastly is put choices as in their first.

[00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.420]
I don't think that Joyce's ass was in there.

[00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.660]
Anybody else would want to sit down.

[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.500]
But I'll end note.

[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.060]
Yes.

[00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.640]
Happy Wednesday to, to Marlon's one of Game Last Night, that's two in a row.

[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:05.940]
They have.

[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:07.360]
Oh, God, are they on fire?

[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.840]
How they found a team that could be?

[00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:09.440]
Yep.

[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.960]
They have 10,979 in a row.

[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.820]
You know what, if they had 10,000 there last night.

[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:15.240]
Yeah.

[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.280]
Chickens are peeing all over the place, right?

[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:17.840]
Exactly.

[00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:18.460]
Right.

[00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:23.500]
Well, but you gotta remember that he came was on, they had some stiff competition there on TV.

[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:23.960]
Yep.

[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.400]
So they had, maybe they had next to a number in there.

[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.360]
Maybe it was like, 1,979.

[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:29.860]
But, yeah, that mistake.

[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.440]
Well, they didn't put anybody extra, they just put a, oh, in there like they got across the street.

[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:35.640]
Like, we got between two and four, we got O's.

[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.840]
What do you, maybe I should change my mind on that.

[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.000]
Maybe we should just let them have George, you know, maybe I'm being selfish here.

[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:42.820]
Let's do it, I have George get off the air at noon.

[00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:44.260]
That's a holiday, right?

[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:44.880]
Right.

[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.360]
Yeah, George says there was a break.

[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.940]
Yeah, let's go ahead and do it, Clarice.

[00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:50.940]
Go in there and tell him I changed my mind.

[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:51.980]
I'll go tell him.

[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.020]
I'm serious, I'm not joking, what do you think?

[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:54.940]
Comper.

[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.340]
That's up to you.

[00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.460]
I mean, nothing, nothing said a precedent, let them do it again.

[00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:05.420]
But I think if they, you know, if they want to put that jackass, I mean, the big O on the air.

[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:06.440]
He after all is.

[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:07.220]
Rock solid.

[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:08.640]
More power to him.

[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:13.040]
Oh, and I never talked to you about his plans for, he went to our new leader.

[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.900]
He's got a plan he wants to stab more minorities on here.

[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.920]
Me more people speak of a picket of Pawnee.

[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:19.840]
I heard about that.

[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.260]
Yeah, he thinks that's the solution to our eels as we put more Spanish speaking people on here.

[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:28.220]
Noah Abel English a key Spanish sports.

[00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:28.760]
What do you think?

[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.080]
A lot of soccer.

[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:36.200]
A lot of soccer that's especially says if Hank can talk about horse racing, I can't talk about soccer, you know.

[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:37.260]
Or that.

[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.680]
And of course, I think, you know, I'm going to the World Cup in Berlin this summer.

[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.480]
So I'll not go to the games.

[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:43.680]
My friends are going to the games.

[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:44.800]
I have no interest in that.

[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.080]
I would like to see that.

[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:52.160]
So I would not expect to one of the last off in broadcast I did was the exhibition game in Berlin.

[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:52.840]
Yeah.

[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:53.400]
Yeah.

[00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:55.520]
I think that was the end of the franchise right there.

[00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.240]
I think that's what put him in the tank.

[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.360]
I don't know if that was the one where Rick didn't know he was on.

[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:02.220]
Oh, yeah.

[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.940]
And he was talking about the food.

[00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.440]
Oh, I think, oh, yeah, that's a food.

[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:05.820]
The food.

[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:06.860]
Remember, we had that.

[00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:09.380]
Yeah, you know, it was one of the bits you played.

[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.360]
Oh, yeah, about the chicken.

[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:11.880]
Yeah.

[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.780]
What is that?

[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:13.260]
Is that chicken?

[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:13.760]

[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.200]
Somewhere we got that one.

[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:16.500]
That was hard.

[00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:17.160]
That's great.

[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.200]
That was done in Berlin.

[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:23.640]
Oh, he was a panic.

[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:28.860]
Of course, he took himself so seriously that I'm sure that once he found out it was on here, he just about bust a good.

[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.160]
He took himself very, very seriously.

[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.700]
Unlike us who just want the money in the hell of these people in the country.

[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.720]
So did George and George go in there and tell clients to good news?

[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.500]
No, I'll wait for the.

[00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:33.480]
Yeah, I'm sure he's going to be a good guy.

[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:33.480]

[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:33.480]

[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:33.480]

[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:33.480]

[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:33.480]

[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:33.480]

[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:33.480]

[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:33.480]

[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:33.480]

[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:33.480]

[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:33.480]

[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:33.480]

[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:33.480]

[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:33.480]

[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:33.480]

[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:33.480]

[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:33.480]

[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:33.480]

[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.520]
Oh, he died?

[00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:35.280]
I don't know.

[00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:36.960]
I shouldn't say that.

[00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.900]
That's how he's a bad move without knowing.

[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:40.480]
Yeah.

[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:44.040]
But Ramero had to mention that is because Jerry Bailey finally returned.

[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.460]
The two of them looked so much alike.

[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.680]
It was always staggering to me.

[00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:47.480]
I couldn't tell him apart.

[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.340]
They look very much alike.

[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:49.160]
They had the same moon.

[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.700]
Jerry does a great job with us.

[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:51.160]
Moon face?

[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:51.760]
Yeah.

[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:52.700]
He's very good.

[00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.620]
Well, it's good like he would have Belmont, man.

[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.140]
You better hope that Bernardini runs in there.

[00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.800]
You ought to call up the connection, say either Rhyme or getting a hitman.

[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.980]
You talk about the knight at Belmont on a week two weeks from Saturday?

[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:03.520]
Yes.

[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:04.320]
Yeah.

[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.660]
I'm sure they're devastated by that one.

[00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:08.120]
Yeah.

[00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.640]
Well, Barbara is still alive, I guess, huh?

[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:12.500]
Yes, he is.

[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.800]
And do it very well, very frisky and bouncing around.

[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.020]
It reminds me of the bird flu thing.

[00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:21.760]
They've got everybody all panicky that they could get infection and the other leg.

[00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:26.180]
I mean, granted, there are risks, but I think they're a little getting carried away.

[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.560]
I think they're covering their butts.

[00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:28.500]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.980]
Somebody asked me yesterday about Lloyd's alone in it.

[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:33.360]
You know, if they had an insurance policy, they did.

[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.360]
I'm sure that they did, but those are very expensive now for a horse.

[00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:39.120]
As you probably know, there's a story about that.

[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.320]
And I think today's terrible.

[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:41.820]
Yeah.

[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.560]
Well, the horse was insured for 25 million.

[00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:45.080]
Wow.

[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.580]
And it is extremely expensive.

[00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:48.100]
Hmm.

[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.700]
So, well, make sure someone insures for 25 minutes.

[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:53.980]
Not when they find out what they're doing on Monday.

[00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:00.900]
Maybe they'll insure our land over a 20-sink old.

[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:01.980]
That makes us, I'm sureable.

[00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:03.240]
Yeah.

[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:04.400]
20-sink old.

[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:05.880]
Okay, listen, have a great day today.

[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.100]
I hope you clean up real big time today.

[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.260]
I'm going to go out there and find a good machine, man.

[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.420]
I'm going to take billions of dollars out of that place.

[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:13.720]
I'm going to clean that place out.

[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:14.920]
I'm headed for the dentist.

[00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:15.940]
Are you really?

[00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:16.280]
Yeah.

[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.680]
But if I get done quick enough, I'll be at cold.

[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:18.960]
Yeah.

[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.500]
Well, you don't have your cell phone.

[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.020]
Okay.

[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:21.820]
Keep in touch.

[00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:22.120]
Oh, my God.

[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:22.320]
All right.

[00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:22.840]
All right.

[00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:25.220]
If you could watch solid.

[00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:26.160]
If you could watch solid.

[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.040]
Or those of the hosts, guests and collars.

[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.480]
And you not reflect those of the busy broadcast group.

[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:30.780]
Yeah.

[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.260]
You know, you know, that's just a nice.

[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.240]
For 20-sink old.

[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.140]
For 20-sink old.

[00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:36.740]
For 20-sink old.

[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:37.340]
For 20-sink old.

[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.260]
For 20-sink old.

[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:38.260]

[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:39.100]
For 20-sink old.

[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:40.600]
For 20-sink old.

[00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.240]
For 20-sink old.

[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.620]
Oh, my God.

[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.140]
Neil Rogers is right there.

[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:47.540]
Come.

[00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:48.440]
Start.

[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.180]
That's a looted.

[00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:56.320]
Charlie and Denise got the whole thing started.

[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:04.180]
If it makes she day also parted.

[00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:11.800]
When she finished all that, we just finished late.

[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.680]
We don't mind if the fans were to say,

[00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:18.780]
Oh, what a lie.

[00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:21.840]
You wonder if this was the gamble.

[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.920]
Maybe for every song with this gamble.

[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:30.920]
When she's just gonna hang on and enjoy the ride.

[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:37.960]
Is that why we've been gotta stay down high with.

[00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.680]
The game is probably going sideways.

[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:46.660]
Rich and Tommy Lee stretch her out so wide.

[00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:51.860]
10-14.

[00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:52.680]
Let me ask you.

[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:53.840]
Do you want to give the news?

[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:54.660]
I didn't.

[00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:57.660]
You ran on the hall to see if, you know,

[00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:58.460]
What a delay.

[00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.020]
Oh, man.

[00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:04.480]
Why the hell not, man?

[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.080]
We're here to cooperate.

[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:05.680]
Right?

[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:07.260]
And slack as much as possible.

[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:07.880]
That's right.

[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.260]
We're gonna cooperate and give as much extra time off as possible.

[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.060]
This is QAM and let's face it, folks.

[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.080]
We just don't care.

[00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.680]
Why the hell should we be the odd ones out?

[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:18.100]
We're already odd enough as it is.

[00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:19.360]
We couldn't care more than they do.

[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.340]
And that'll give both of you guys off at noon.

[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:23.640]
I don't know about Josh who's gonna be bored up in it.

[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.180]
Yeah, you won't have anything to do with that.

[00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.100]
That should be part of the deal.

[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:28.380]
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.860]
Is that both of you guys get to leave.

[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.700]
But he had gold, a flying strip line gets a 91 rating by

[00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.160]
Cigar, a Fissi and Otter Cigar and Cider,

[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.540]
and 9.1 by Schmokrangazine.

[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.640]
This rich flavored well balanced full body Nicaragua when Cigars got

[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.080]
Earthy hints of dark roast coffee.

[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:42.740]
Chocolate spicing pepper flavors.

[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:43.880]
Also tried that me.

[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:44.700]
He had this say oh.

[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.880]
The hottest release Cigar in last 10 months gets a high rating of 91

[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.140]
by Cigar Fissi and Otter Cigar inside her.

[00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:53.920]
A powerful, big, gigantic gut wrenching cigar with complex notes

[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:54.960]
of leather, earthen pepper.

[00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:58.140]
That finishes long and full body with initial spice and a note of

[00:15:58.140 --> 00:15:58.740]
charred wood.

[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:02.500]

[00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.820]
make sense. I have to do much to drink.

[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.500]
A beer of Jack Daniels and absolute.

[00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:53.180]
That's sick.

[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.560]
That is a problem. The bush code.

[00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.820]
Witness the biggest cover-up in the human world.

[00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.000]
I'm here to discuss our strategy.

[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.600]

You have a cell phone number, don't you?

[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.600]
Yeah. We're just texting that way.

[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:36.380]
You don't have to talk to him.

[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.620]
Oh, that's bad.

[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:39.660]
For your brutal.

[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:40.860]
A lot's a good idea though.

[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.360]
Other than GW, what person makes you want to puke when you see a lot of TV?

[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:45.480]
Bill O'Reilly, 350.

[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:47.820]
The worst person in the world equinoquins to Keith Obergman.

[00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:52.140]
By the way, Keith Obergman's numbers are kind of like what we got between two and four unfortunately.

[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:53.660]
But that's all of MSNBC.

[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:54.660]
They have no audience.

[00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.060]
Pat Roberts in 326, a very solid second.

[00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:58.880]
Rock solid.

[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.600]
Jesse Jackson, 236.

[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.880]
Sean Hannity makes a lot of people want to puke 174.

[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.840]
Don Rumsfeld, Hermann Gary 118.

[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:07.280]
Tadwood Rick Sanchez, 118.

[00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:07.960]
Same person.

[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:08.860]
Different language.

[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.380]
Rosio Donnelly, 83.

[00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:11.680]

[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:14.780]
Tucker Carlson, 31.

[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:15.700]
Bono is God.

[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.880]
Mary Chaney, that self-hating dike.

[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.180]
That wicked nasty dike, Scott 28.

[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:22.820]
Paula Abdul, 25.

[00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:24.400]
Chris Matthews, 14.

[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.980]
Denise Rodman, 13.

[00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:27.780]
William Donnelly, who has a catholic rate.

[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.540]
Mary Madeline, 7.

[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:31.560]
Billy May 7.

[00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:32.560]
The Aussie Clean Guy.

[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.560]
Ron Reagan, Jr., the ballet dancer.

[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:36.380]
Sultanta, 7.

[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.080]
Sultanta, 7.

[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.020]
I'm missing languages now.

[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:41.600]
That's very bad.

[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.180]
Let's do a little Italian, a little Spanish.

[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.960]
How about Latin for all our Roman listeners?

[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:50.380]
Oh, 50 misbonis.

[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:51.720]
We have a lot of them.

[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.720]
A little a lot of them, I don't have a lot of them.

[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:54.580]
A little bit of that, right?

[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.520]
Like that spot that your body has got me doing.

[00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:58.500]
I can't pronounce it.

[00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:04.740]
We have reached, no seriously, we have reached epidemic proportions of insanity in this radio station.

[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:09.780]
And of course, your good, gross personal friend that I paid $1,000 to so we could get your contract renewed.

[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.740]
Then I paid him a grain out of my pocket.

[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.980]
He's like non-composed, he don't respond.

[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.860]
He's not in touch these days.

[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:18.340]
I'm not talking about on the phone.

[00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:20.740]
I'm just talking about a non-invasion email.

[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.240]
Just in general?

[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:27.540]
Yeah, just a non-invasive email that would like to answer some of the questions that I have and things that are going on.

[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:29.400]
He's useless.

[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.100]
As useless as boobs on a frog.

[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:32.560]
Here's today's pool.

[00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.520]
And it's pretty interesting how the audience has turned.

[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:36.500]
We've done this before.

[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:40.660]
Because I keep going through these different emotions and the whole repertoire.

[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:42.040]
About 80 million times.

[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.320]
So the caller is like, how come they were not streaming, by the way?

[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:46.700]
We're having some issues.

[00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:48.300]
Oh, they're not aware they are yet.

[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:49.500]
But as soon as I said we're having one.

[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.140]
Issues and I don't know who's end there on.

[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:53.160]
Probably ours.

[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.860]
Just went back to the green light again.

[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:55.740]
Thanks God.

[00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:57.440]
The caller is suck 109.

[00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:00.300]
If Neil stop taking calls, I'll kill myself 67.

[00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:02.300]
I hate this pool 57.

[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:04.840]
Listen less 55.

[00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:06.540]
Stop listing 33.

[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:07.360]
Bye-bye.

[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:08.840]
Kiss the radio 29.

[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:09.640]
That's what I voted.

[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.080]
I'll kiss it from the inside out.

[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.460]
Listen much less 26.

[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:13.560]
Listen more 22.

[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:14.820]
Listen much more 18.

[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.600]
So if you take listen more and much more, that's 40.

[00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:19.380]
And listen to the same 332.

[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:22.000]
That's almost 50% right there.

[00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:23.200]
Kiss the radio.

[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:27.540]
If you take all the ones that basically ripped the caller and asked like the caller is suck and put them all together.

[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.400]
You've got 75 to 80%.

[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:34.940]
And you can only assume that the caller is the 12 misfits that they probably voted numerous times on.

[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.300]
Especially I'll kill myself.

[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.220]
Because what are the people going to do if I don't fail to kill themselves?

[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:42.120]
Two or three minutes of greatness on the air.

[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.520]
Is a great thought that they are going to talk.

[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.680]
Since there's no other real local talk.

[00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.320]
I see. They have no other...

[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.300]
What do you mean by that?

[00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:49.440]
They can call across the street.

[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:52.520]
Like I said, they can call us sports shows.

[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:57.180]
In fact, that one promo we had from the Humber Show a couple days ago was your friend Reverend Dishmuck.

[00:22:58.740 --> 00:22:59.860]
So they already do.

[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.020]
That's their life.

[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:01.740]
Well they have...

[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:02.320]
I have no life.

[00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:09.660]
Like I said yesterday, after all of this time the idea that I'm going to just hand the show the keys to the kingdom over the same 10 or 12 misfits.

[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:10.560]
It's just pointless.

[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.640]
I think the answer is to do what we did yesterday.

[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.980]
But as every now and then when they least expected, reach over and punch one up.

[00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:19.980]
And voila, work two for two yesterday. They won't happen again probably.

[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.340]
I'll give that a happy again anytime soon.

[00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.220]
I'll tell you what will happen sometime soon.

[00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:28.320]
That is the Marlon pregame show. Marlon's on Dec. 12, 30.

[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.940]
Look at him make it three in a row.

[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.320]
Over the hapless, useless cubs man.

[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.840]
Marlon's in a Cubs at 105 from PP Park.

[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.500]
Jim Mandage follows the ballgame till seven then we got...

[00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.180]
Oh my god, look at that.

[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.440]
Gell these seven to ten in the anycappelin show.

[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:43.900]
It's not bad enough that he usually has to follow the Marlon broadcast.

[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.420]
A fate worth the death.

[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:46.400]
Now he's got to follow.

[00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.080]
Oh my god, the QM hyena.

[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.760]
That is a sad task.

[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:55.240]
Oh, Stuttering Gell who all of a sudden is spelling his name right today.

[00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:56.520]
I don't not find this.

[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.200]
He never there was never this format and his faxes before.

[00:23:59.680 --> 00:23:59.860]
Yeah.

[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.400]
You have any work that goes into that?

[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:03.520]

This is Neil Roger.

[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:08.380]
What's called this is 5.62 AF.

[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:11.280]
A bit hard.

[00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:14.560]
The Rogers hot sports holiday.

[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:17.100]
The O.W.Q.A.L.

[00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:22.280]
Hello, this is Michael V. Hayden director of the NSA.

[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:26.420]
I make you speak to you about the database of telephone calling records the NSA has been compiling.

[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.400]
The NSA does not listen in on personal telephone calls.

[00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:36.660]
For example, although we know Nathan R. Broth Price of 714, Rethal Road and Dullford Kansas made a two minute call to his wife on Saturday, May 14th,

[00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:41.120]
who was visiting her cousin Sandra Fletcher in Lumpur, Nebraska, we do not know what they spoke up.

[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:48.160]
We are also completely unaware of the details of conversations between Nathan and his secretary Mimi Volvano during three calls on the same day,

[00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:50.800]
lasting 22, 28 and 117 minutes.

[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:51.460]
Really?

[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:58.500]
And while we are aware of the 47 calls Joseph Blanson placed to several members in the 90976 commercial area codes,

[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:03.220]
we have no interest whatsoever in any deviant behavior he may be engaged in.

[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:09.500]
Although we know he placed a seven minute call to gay toys in Hollywood, California, we do not know what if anything he ordered.

[00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:10.200]
Really?

[00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:18.740]
Remember, our goal is protecting you from terrorists, not compiling a list of citizens who behave in ways that are condemned by our narrow interpretation of the Bible, praise Jesus.

[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:23.460]
And we certainly have no plans of someday rounding them all up and pushing them into a fiery pit.

[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:24.400]
Really?

[00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:27.700]
The NSA, you can trust us because we're good.

[00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:36.100]
We're going to tell him Mary, but I'm the dog.

[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:40.100]
Maybe he has a misery, but he has a lot of fun over here.

[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:42.040]
Yeah, he's baby.

[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:47.140]
Wooo, baby, and he's the one tonight.

[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:52.260]
Yeah, we're in Lumpur, Nebraska, and she's the most beautiful speaker guy.

[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.720]
Everything's at off to the need all.

[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.720]
How about you, I got a record that you don't have in there because it's too old.

[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.160]
The flying saucer by a Buchanan in Goodman.

[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:01.060]
Really?

[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:04.640]
There's a little clip from a long-tonged cell in there.

[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:09.240]
Remember, you never heard that flying saucer by Buchanan in Goodman?

[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.340]
Yeah, I have it in my hand.

[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:11.480]
Oh, you have it?

[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:12.520]
On a cassette.

[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:18.440]
Oh, I have a Buchanan in Goodman collection on a cassette that I've been meaning to digitize.

[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:19.680]
Oh, look at this.

[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:24.440]
A reverend who introduced Republican gubernatorial candidate Charlie Cris during a breakfast with other pastures.

[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:28.960]
Monday said the Lord came to him in a dream two years ago and told him that Cris would be the state-stacked governor.

[00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:29.640]
Hey, Charlie.

[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:30.420]
You're fairie.

[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:31.740]
How do you like that?

[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:38.020]
The reverend O'Neill Dozier said that before the dream he didn't know Cris or I'd Cris made a knownist plan to run for good governor.

[00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:40.200]
He didn't know him in a biblical sense.

[00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:46.400]
The Lord Jesus spoke to me and he said there's something I want you to know, said Dozier, pastor of the Worldwide Christian Center in Pompeo Beach.

[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.680]
Charlie Cris will be the next governor of the state of Florida.

[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.420]
The Lord told him.

[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:50.020]
How do you like that?

[00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:50.860]
Man.

[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:54.460]
Since then Dozier spent time with Cris and talked with him at length about policy.

[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:57.700]
He told the group that Cris will be an uncompromising in his Christian faith.

[00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:02.600]
I introduced to you as the Lord Jesus has said the next governor of the state of Florida, Charlie Cris, Dozier said,

[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:07.460]
Cris' first words were, well as they say that praise doesn't get any higher and either does George.

[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:12.680]
Chief financial officer Tom Gagler, who's opposing Cris to the primary, wouldn't come out of their marks after the event.

[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:14.620]
And it goes on and on.

[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:17.540]
Now let's see, here's a note at the bottom of this crack.

[00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:21.480]
Yes, that's the main reason I sent it because of their little note.

[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:24.860]
It says, I like hearing calls but not the same pranks over and over.

[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.860]
Bring back screen calls at least part of the time.

[00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:28.040]
No, we're not thinking of the great idea.

[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:29.780]
What do you do think it's a good idea?

[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.500]
I'm just a bust and chausher.

[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:32.680]
I don't care.

[00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:35.220]
No, you're probably welcome.

[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:39.820]
You can just go on and change something?

[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.580]
No, of course not.

[00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:42.440]
I'll be held up right away.

[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:44.120]
I mean, he's got certain voices down.

[00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:44.940]
That's for sure.

[00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:48.460]
No, but it's not the point because they've always got their bunk-buck buddies there.

[00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:48.740]
That's right.

[00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:50.420]
All in and then they hand them the instrument.

[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.860]
They're a big one or two if the equipment works.

[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.500]
But of course, and again, it's on your end.

[00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:57.980]
I'll want everybody to understand that it always is.

[00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.320]
Is and that's something.

[00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:03.660]
You've been in this to me taking place between the students and the local authorities.

[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.520]
See, oh, you're playing the Buchanan Good Appliance Oscars.

[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:08.440]
I love it.

[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:11.800]
I was wondering about this phone thing and why doesn't it work?

[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.800]
I'm holding up three numbers so I'm going to find your end again.

[00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:15.100]
I said, I'm holding up three numbers.

[00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:15.880]
Oh, wait a minute.

[00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:16.480]
It works now.

[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:17.140]
QA.

[00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:17.820]
I'm working now.

[00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:18.520]
Yes, sir.

[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:20.100]
I just want to hear my voice on the radio.

[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:20.940]
Okay, good.

[00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:22.320]
Well, that's an improvement though.

[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:23.080]
We'll take that.

[00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:25.260]
I can't wait for you to get those good vibrations.

[00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:26.500]
That was good.

[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:27.840]
That was a different, somebody different anyway.

[00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:28.340]
Right?

[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:30.500]
Okay, that's enough for right now.

[00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:33.840]
Yeah, I'm going to pick up from that thing yesterday.

[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:34.480]
I'll be with you.

[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.060]
Be safe.

[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:36.600]
Right, stop.

[00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:37.480]
Find your guys.

[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:40.960]
You shake my nerves and you round the break.

[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:41.940]
Oh, drive me.

[00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:43.960]
That's your love, that's a man is saying.

[00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:47.200]
You broke my wings to the quarter three.

[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.360]
And this race is great.

[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:50.380]
Ball the fire.

[00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:53.420]
Radio station where things just don't work, man.

[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:56.180]
It's just sometimes they do and sometimes they don't.

[00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:57.320]
And sometimes it's just as well.

[00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:57.520]
Right.

[00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:58.880]
Too bad we might surprise you.

[00:29:59.100 --> 00:29:59.440]
That's right.

[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.660]
And then another reason to be tuned in every day.

[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:03.240]
Like they used to say on S U N those days.

[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:04.400]
Check back what is later.

[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:07.480]
You know, as if to say, well, we know you don't like whatever is on right now.

[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:08.640]
But check back what is later.

[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.020]
Maybe there'll be something on you like then.

[00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:12.740]
When you hear those needle tapes for the 18th time that day.

[00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:17.540]
You know, I'm really distraught because I've been, I've went several days without reading

[00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:18.880]
Bob Lassiter's blog, you know.

[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:21.940]
And then today it's like a soap opera.

[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.220]
You know, you figure you'll catch up.

[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:28.920]
And so I read today and I guess yesterday or a couple days ago he had written what he thought was going to be the last entry on there.

[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.960]
And then he let people respond which he's been doing what's a month in their comments.

[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.600]
And he's in very bad shape, which I'm very sorry to hear.

[00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:39.180]
And I've been emailing back and forth not for a while now.

[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:41.860]
But you know, for a while there were emailing and talking to the phone once or twice.

[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.200]
And I don't know what to say.

[00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:45.640]
You reach the point where you like the email.

[00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:49.540]
And I read all the other messages from some of the, his listeners over the years.

[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:51.180]
And some of the messages they're fine.

[00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:53.160]
And some of them are, well, you know, the Lord this.

[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:57.380]
And even though they know that he's an atheist like I am and don't want any part of the world to scrap it.

[00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:59.340]
They just insist on voicing it upon him.

[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:02.200]
They really do. They think that the closer you are to death, you'll come around.

[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:03.640]
Yeah, oh exactly right.

[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:07.060]
Well, I'm not, you know, I don't want to say closer to death because that sounds awfully final.

[00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:08.240]
But I just, I wish him the best.

[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.020]
And I probably will send him a message later on.

[00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:11.100]
But just sad.

[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:12.240]
Really tragic.

[00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:14.580]
But it happens to the best of us, you know.

[00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:15.800]
I haven't thought of this.

[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:18.140]
It's just epidemic sooner or later. It's going around you.

[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.380]
Sometimes too soon.

[00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:22.940]
20 to 11 at 560 WQ I am at the melting bottom.

[00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:24.280]
And this isn't just another meal.

[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.440]
Man, this is another hamburger joint or steakhouse.

[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.440]
This is an incredibly unique place.

[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:31.560]
Fondue is a memorable four-course dining experience at the pot.

[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:34.120]
Where it can really dip into something different and delicious.

[00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:36.600]
At the melting pot, you'll enjoy a variety of unique,

[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.840]
on-fraising special melting pot dipping sauces.

[00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:40.880]
That's the key man is those sauces.

[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:43.140]
Imagine starting dinner with a melting pot.

[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.720]
And cheese fondue served with three different bread's grannies with apples and crisp veggies.

[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.740]
Next, you choice the salads over the melting pot, homemade dressings.

[00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:53.240]
On-fraising include lobster, filet, minion, shrimp, cagin, seasoned chicken, pork,

[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:56.140]
portabello, shrooms, duck and lots more cooked and oil are brought.

[00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:59.440]
And those melting pot dipping sauces, like I said, are really spectacular.

[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:03.840]
For dessert, beyond spectacular, they haven't invented a word in the English language to describe.

[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.800]
Just how good those desserts are.

[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.160]
The chocolate fondue is beyond description like I said.

[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:09.680]
Dip all your fruits in there, man.

[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.020]
Your fresh strawberries, bananas.

[00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:12.300]
Stick your banana in there.

[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:12.760]
Your pineapple.

[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:17.860]
And your cheesecake, grannies topped off with tasty marshmallows, rolled in crust Oreos, and graham crackers.

[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:20.780]
The melting pot for something delicious, different and affordable too.

[00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:23.780]
Take the whole gang out there real soon, you'll find them all over town now.

[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.920]
There's a melting pot in Kimmel, Cooper City, North Miami Beach, Volca,

[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.720]
Crayl Springs, and most prestigious, for Lauderdale.

[00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:32.160]
This is meal Roger.

[00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:36.500]
This is 5.16 Q.A.S.

[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.420]
The Vaticanism sent a boycott of his their big threats.

[00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:51.420]
Because they dig it's a loo.

[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:56.460]
They claim that raw power's new flick is focused on.

[00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:59.180]
And like African-Gangriettes, a binchiko.

[00:32:59.540 --> 00:32:59.860]
A bucho.

[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.300]
But the controversy's proving it's just a little bit.

[00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:06.940]
Don't have an episode.

[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:13.160]
And they're ticked off more than a smidge and hit to punch their whole religion.

[00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:15.140]
Man, react to binchiko.

[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:24.580]
They just can't stand this guy.

[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:28.380]
They're angry and I'll tell you the reason why.

[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.320]
They say it's a lie.

[00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:32.380]
Just like James Fry.

[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:39.440]
When you go to buy your ticket, you may see people pick it on the side of the road.

[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:44.460]
But not everyone's a green million's of books.

[00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:45.120]
Well, he's seen it.

[00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:51.940]
That 46.14 before 11 at 5.60 WQM.

[00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:52.780]
Let's get down to it.

[00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:54.920]
I thought it'd be no more flim today.

[00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:56.740]
You're close to the end of that though.

[00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:57.560]
Think about you.

[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:00.960]
I'm bringing all the flim out of my neck.

[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:02.980]
The ringing and climbing of slots begin.

[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:04.700]
That is likely to be heard and browed by labor.

[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:08.120]
I told him this is so sad.

[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:09.260]
So slow.

[00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:10.600]
I give everything else in Florida, man.

[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.700]
Oh, good stuff is coming if you live long enough.

[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:14.480]
It's coming but don't hold your breath.

[00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:16.660]
Look at that.

[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:17.560]
Oh, wow.

[00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:21.700]
I think that's my first magenta flamin' history.

[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:26.440]
Officials, well, good old yenta deserves to hakape magenta.

[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:26.900]
Do you think?

[00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:28.200]
Oh, yeah, I forgot to play this.

[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:31.960]
The W.N.C.A. is the pixel of the hits.

[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:34.460]
Well, what if they die?

[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:37.600]
Do you understand your guy?

[00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:41.320]
No, but you can see it.

[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:48.200]
This is a couple of small things about it.

[00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:51.020]
We see the end of it, so I'm not feeling well.

[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.620]
Wait, wait, that's a little bit.

[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:03.280]
He's got an old Vienna to come to our name.

[00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:05.820]
We're back up in the woods among the evergreen.

[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:12.600]
Officials from Hellendale Beach's Mardi Gras race track and gaming center, which is a Hollywood

[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:13.160]
dog track.

[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:17.440]
And Gostyne Park said yesterday they're ready to push ahead, licensing applications, even

[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:21.760]
as the state puts the finishing touches on machine regulations, the finishing touches,

[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:22.740]
they're touching it.

[00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:24.740]
As slowly as they possibly can.

[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:29.300]
Toppo-no Park harness, which is undergoing a $140 million renovation hopes to get its

[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:31.740]
$1,500 machines operating by early next year.

[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:35.660]
I'm ready to go, said Dan Atkins, vice president of Mardi Gras, which used to be a Hollywood

[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:38.160]
Greyhound, who led the drive to Brainslam machines to Florida.

[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.880]
This has been six long years, and I'm not getting excited next week, all my documentation

[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.500]
will be ready to reply for a license.

[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:47.200]
The state division of Paramutrile Way during yesterday held the final public hearing

[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:50.740]
on how to regulate the new gaming centers, a room full of paramutrile and gambling executives,

[00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:55.820]
lobbyists to represent us from slot machine manufacturers, spent hours reviewing more than

[00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:58.860]
100 pages of regulation expected to be in place by late June.

[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.880]
The rules can be contested by anyone during the next 10 days.

[00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:04.280]
If there are challenges, it'll take effect 21 days later.

[00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:08.040]
We try to craft the rules in the best way to protect the citizens of the patrons and

[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:11.080]
enable the paramutrials to operate in a fair manner, said David Roberts directed the

[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.920]
paramutrile division, who's putting the rules together.

[00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:17.240]
The state law adopted by the legislature in December allows each paramutrile in the

[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:22.080]
store to 1,500 machines, the revenue from those slots will be taxed at 50% the highest

[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:26.940]
rate in the nation for an expected windfall of $290 million dollars the first full year of operation.

[00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:31.020]
The windfall could be much, much higher except well, nevertheless.

[00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:35.840]
Just to cutting down a number of machines that are cutting down, you can't do this and you can't do that.

[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.900]
Cancer of drinks can't have the ATM.

[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.780]
The legislature mandated that the division develop regulations by early July or give

[00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:44.500]
rowarts for paramutrials temporary licenses to begin operating.

[00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:47.620]
If the state rules are challenging, temporary licenses will be issued.

[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:52.880]
While the state can take up to 90 days to process license applications, agency officials say it's usually done the

[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:53.280]
last time.

[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:56.460]
At consent, he could add the new gaming up and running by late August.

[00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:01.400]
If there are no holdups and either is application or licensing of the slot machine manufacturers by the state.

[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:04.200]
There appears to be no construct activity at Daniel Highly.

[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:09.260]
Steve Snyder, the paramutrials president, gave no indication when he plans to apply for license or start

[00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:11.580]
slot operations. Why would that be? I wonder what that's all about.

[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:15.600]
Workers of Gulfstream and Mardi Gras are hammering away at rooms that will house their slot machines.

[00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:22.360]
At Palpatot Park, large tractors are digging up sand and dirt as they prepare for a 157,000 square foot

[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:24.240]
racino, kind of like woodbind.

[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:29.560]
Steel beams and construction material have been sitting in the parking lot for so long waiting for the state to come up with regulations.

[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:32.500]
At track officials began getting questions from patrons about it.

[00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:36.260]
The stuff has been sitting there since May of last year, so they find where the parts are a manager.

[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:37.640]
We decided to have a little fun.

[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:41.820]
Signs have gone up with large red letters declaring future sight for world's largest

[00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:45.140]
Lego building and racino construction coming soon.

[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:47.180]
Recently, the materials have been moved around.

[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:52.000]
Our contractors said that hopefully by the end of next week there will be the beginnings of some steel going up in the air,

[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:53.720]
fineberg said. They're going up in the air.

[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.540]
Kind of like most of the horses that they've ingraham drives, they're going up in the air.

[00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.200]
All they jumped it off again, I'll be damned.

[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:00.200]
Okay, let's see.

[00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:02.320]
Let's take a look at that pole so far.

[00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:05.700]
This is one of the most important scientific poles we probably ever take when we do this.

[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:07.500]
How many times have we done this pole before?

[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:08.620]
About 30, man.

[00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:12.720]
I'm probably, if nothing else, this does accomplish one thing.

[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:17.180]
And that is it lets some of these jackasses cool their heels for a while, cool their cooler phones off.

[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:18.620]
Give it a rest.

[00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:19.620]
Yeah, give it a rest.

[00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:22.200]
Exactly. I couldn't put it better myself. Give it a freaking rest.

[00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:23.860]
825 votes.

[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:27.040]
Oh, and by the way, we will make a thousand by 1230. Aren't you proud of us?

[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:27.680]
Yeah.

[00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:30.580]
So what's the story? Did the parents come back in or say something?

[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:31.820]
No, not. Come back yet, so.

[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:32.620]
Well, why not?

[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:40.520]
Maybe they're, you know, I think I should be padded on the back and probably give it an extra 50 grand or something, just for being such a hell of a nice guy to go along with them.

[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:45.520]
Or at least we ought to, the three of us ought to divvy up whatever cash is coming in from that sale.

[00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:47.100]
You know, you're not remote, huh?

[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:47.280]

[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:48.700]
We ought to be able to skim the cream.

[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:53.080]
Christ's sake. So I ought to have a little sum to stick in our freezer just enough to wet our beacons.

[00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:53.560]
Right.

[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:55.060]
825 votes.

[00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:59.060]
831. Oh, they're coming in big, gigantic, juicy chunks now.

[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:07.080]
If Neil stop taking calls, I'll listen to them. And by the way, the guy that called today, the one, if you listen to yourself on the radio, you thought you sounded pretty good.

[00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:09.280]
Call us back tomorrow. Maybe we'll give it the two to four slot.

[00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:13.540]
If, if, well, we got to find out how many things.

[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:21.080]
If Neil stop taking calls, I'll listen the same 373, 44.8%, damn near 45%, damn near a half.

[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:28.060]
The caller is suck. 117. There's another 14%. Now we're almost up to 60%. I'll kill myself 74 because...

[00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:28.960]
I have no life.

[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:34.100]
Those are the caller 74. Those are the, and of course 74 means each one of them is voted about 10 times.

[00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:34.720]
Right.

[00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:40.020]
I hate this poll 65 and I have no idea why. I think it's a fabulous poll. Fabulous.

[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:46.440]
I'll listen less 63. I'll stop listening 37. How do you like that, Mr. Smarty Pants? Well, bye-bye.

[00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:53.380]
Listen, see, I'm not, I've never been one of those people like, um, impressed with threats from the audience.

[00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:56.480]
Because I know that they're not going to stop listening, no matter what.

[00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:58.200]
How do you think you make? Yeah, right.

[00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:03.480]
Stop listening 37, likely story. Listen, much less 31. Kiss the radio has got...

[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:04.960]
About third, man.

[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:09.640]
Including George, who probably got some bad information. He'll be out sick again next couple of days.

[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:16.120]
I'll listen more 23 and listen much more 18. So you put those last three categories together between kissing it.

[00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:23.340]
Let's see, 50 and it's 6.8. I mean, you're talking a lot of people who are just grossed out by what has been going on here.

[00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:30.360]
And of course, we're grossed out by this new management team, both the general mangler and the sales mangler, who are just like playing fast and loo-dlo-dlo.

[00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:36.880]
This is kind of a pay-toy, like they just went to a Lionel play world. They got a brand new toy and they're like, uh, diddling around with it.

[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:41.400]
Don't you get that impression? You know, I'm, I'm this Lionel play world. Oh, do you? That's a good shot.

[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:45.480]
Boy, I know what all these people are thinking and I use that term very loosely.

[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:49.660]
Less than half of Americans are satisfied with 9.11 investigations.

[00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:56.740]
According to a new Zogby poll, less than half of Americans are convinced that the events of 9.11 have been thoroughly investigated, raw story has learned.

[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:06.920]
In the telephone survey of 1200 individuals, just 47% agreed that the 9.11 attacks were thoroughly investigated and that any speculation about US government involvement is nonsense.

[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:19.640]
Almost as many, 45% indicated they were more likely to agree that so many unanswered questions about 9.11 remained that Congress or an international tribunal should reinvestigate the attacks, including whether any US government officials were willing to do that.

[00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:49.380]
This poll is the first survey that's attempted to gauge the level of American doubts about 9.11 was carried out for the 9.11 revealing the truth between our future conference to be held in Chicago and June.

[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:49.620]

[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:49.620]

[00:41:49.620 --> 00:42:02.960]
Not surprisingly, Republicans as a group were the most supportive of existing investigations because there are a bunch of idiots and a bunch of bush liquors with 70% expressing their satisfaction about the same percentage that is expressed in approval of Bush's performance of recent polls.

[00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:13.840]
64% of those earning over 75 grand were also skeptical of doubts about 9.11. Shall we that sentence again? To 64%, oh, I see, were skeptical of doubts about 9.11.

[00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:25.560]
The group's most likely to want the attacks reinvestigated were his Spanish at 67%, an African-American at 64%, dark folks.

[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:34.780]
Other groups also skewed one way or another, but with the majority position generally not above 58%. Overall, the breakdown on a question closely followed the usual political divisions in the country.

[00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:44.380]
Republicans against Democrats and Independents, whites versus minorities, the wealthier and better educated versus the poor less educated, people over 50 versus those under 50, men versus women.

[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:55.840]
This Ralph balance and opinions is itself a striking finding. It suggests that doubts about the official accounts of 9.11, far from representing an extreme print position, have become a standard component of anti-establishment attitudes.

[00:42:56.280 --> 00:43:07.860]
When asked specifically if they thought there had been a government cover-up about an instant contradiction of official story, the result was again not far from an even split with 48% rejecting the idea of a delivered cover-up and 42% supporting it.

[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:19.180]
Believe in the cover-up was the majority position among Democrats and among 18 to 29 year olds and a few other groups. You see that? 18 to 29 year olds. Let's say, young people don't believe in the government. You know what they got there some on it.

[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:27.300]
Finally, not of course that they voted or get involved or do anything about it but nevertheless they're busy smoking a big fat one's and getting laid and who the hell can blame them.

[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:36.400]
Especially when all this Iran business coming up pretty soon, that June surprise, the Julio surprise, the October, whatever it's going to be. So they're going to be some kind of a surprise.

[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:51.200]
853 votes, man. We'll have that 1000 easy by 1230 by the time for the pregame show. We've got the anxious Dave Van Boring and Roxy Foxy Bernstein. We've got that gaudy sound like the ill going. We got them with the Abrog Cancer Month or a P.P. Park.

[00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:57.500]
And I checked the weather forecast and it says on my thing, no rain. At least very, very minimal chance of rain.

[00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:04.920]
Did you look out the window? It said cloudy. Look out the wall. Huh? Look out that window there by the wall. Look at that.

[00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:11.060]
Yeah, are you looking at the current? Come back in there and say you're good to go on Monday and you can leave it. You won't be guys at noon. Huh?

[00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:22.620]
Not yet. Well, I'm going to tell you something. We're going to be flagged from Todd Dreck. We're trying we're bending over backward. In fact, we're going to all need a group carer practice around Monday to try to cooperate and help them put some swirl on the air so they can make some cash.

[00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:33.620]
They can rape some four unsuspecting sponsor out there and put rock solid that on air from noon before. Good God. If you have a business and need to get customers away from the competition, then I got the

This is Neil Roger. This is 5 6 9 8.

[00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:49.680]
This is the Neil Roger show. This is the voice. Any questions?

[00:45:50.740 --> 00:46:04.480]
1 2 3 4 more bombs drop. 5 6 7 8 more bombs drop. 9 10 11 12 more bombs drop. We're going to drop the bomb around the glass. We're going to drop them bombs and make a dead.

[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:16.600]
Loose that drag right off their heads. We're going to bomb around the glass tonight. We're going to bomb bomb up after life. We're going to bomb. We're going to bomb around the glass tonight.

[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:52.160]
Welcome.

[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:26.480]
Music.

[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:55.240]
4 crowd perkins man he never got his do you know when it was grave always in the shadow of Elvis but then he had a lot of company and right and Elvis he should rip that off at

[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:14.100]
the end of the day.

[00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:53.260]
And I like millions of these are holders who have to leave the country to have them renewed they may simply remain in the US while this Congress and the president give away all the benefits and privileges of American citizenship.

[00:50:53.800 --> 00:51:09.400]
This is an outright assault in the latest war on the middle class and working men and women who have already become the who have already born the pain of losing good paying manufacturing jobs and a middle class jobs outsource to cheap for labor markets are faced with the onslaught of more illegal immigration and cheap labor in the American economy.

[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:24.860]
This president and Congress talk about bringing illegal aliens out of the shadows while they turn out the lights on our middle class president Bush and his most trusted adviser tell us how well our economy is doing how many jobs have been created and how so called free trade will enrich the lives of the same people whose livelihoods these policies are destroying.

[00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:37.560]
It's not hard to think of the trusted adviser to Catherine the great who sought to hide from her the inversing and shot a condition of Ukrainian and Crimean villages by having elaborate façades built to divert her attention and mask an uncomfortable reality.

[00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:48.200]
I don't know whether Carl Robas president Bush's Gregoray Prattentkin or whether George Bush's creative attempt can villages all by himself but the façades are cracking and fully fronts of failed policies are quickly crumbling.

[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:54.900]
6,000 on our national growth and working as adjunct rear support to our underman under equipped border patrol is not border security.

[00:51:55.100 --> 00:52:00.160]
Two million illegal aliens continue to cross our borders and depress wages by hundreds of billions of dollars every year.

[00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:05.320]
The millions of manufacturing middle class jobs lost over the last five years have been replaced by lower wage employment.

[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:15.580]
The president's faith-based commitment to so-called free trade will likely lead to a $1 trillion US per unit count deficit this year and a trade deficit of four and a half trillion dollars after 30 years of trade deficit.

[00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:20.640]
But third man and while the president and Congress points a no-child left behind as they solution to our educational crisis.

[00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:28.080]
We're failing an entire generation of Americans who test scores continue to fall in whose high school dropout rates will be embarrassing to a third world country.

[00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:34.260]
And a third world country is what we will be if our elected officials don't soon come to their senses. That's your hero Lou Dobbs what he writes.

[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:34.980]
You go Lou.

[00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:39.160]
And I had it. I just printed that baby up.

[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:43.380]
I had it in my hand before that fact before even had a chance to send me just the facts.

[00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:45.700]
Keep trying to tell these people you're on top of it, but they won't.

[00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:48.640]
I'm on top of it baby. I'm on top of old smoky man.

[00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:52.220]
Who did that song on top of all and then there was also on top of spaghetti.

[00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:52.860]
Right.

[00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:54.500]
I read the beyond top of the cheese.

[00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:57.140]
I think I'm allergic to that pasta by the way.

[00:52:57.600 --> 00:52:59.060]
Really? I'm thinking.

[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:05.180]
Yeah. I'm going to go about a week or ten days and just not have any and see if that I'm thinking I think I might be.

[00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:07.720]
Well, though, because the foods that you crave, they've always said this.

[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:09.360]
The foods that you crave are the food you're allergic to.

[00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:14.140]
And ever since I was like a long go a hundred years ago when I was young, who says that?

[00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:15.820]
They. I want to say.

[00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:16.900]
They. It's not coming down.

[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:19.220]
I don't care. Go ahead and smack them in the mouth.

[00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:21.200]
You just try to rationalize your own ever in behavior.

[00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:21.700]
That's right.

[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:24.280]
Pasta and ice cream.

[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:26.140]
Those are the two things I've allergic to.

[00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:31.260]
Go on back. You know when that goes back to especially 1975 WGN a West Palm Beach.

[00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:35.420]
After I lost a hundred pounds, I lost a hundred pounds in, oh, I know about a year.

[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:37.920]
I went from 266 to 170.

[00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:39.880]
Okay. So it's only a hundred pounds.

[00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:41.060]
What a tub.

[00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:43.020]
Oh, I was, oh, I was big as a house.

[00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:44.320]
I was just big in the park.

[00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:45.480]
I was almost in the mountain.

[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:47.300]
I was about half as big as Fatboy.

[00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:48.920]
I'm not big enough to say. Don't go crazy.

[00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:52.080]
No. By the way, Trace Bradford said he and Fatboy are going to be next.

[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:54.680]
I think that Brent and Todd Drekko to be next.

[00:53:54.920 --> 00:54:00.020]
If I get to vote, those would be the two I vote for because Brett's a total idiot and Todd is, oh my god.

[00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:03.540]
Can you even believe what a shameless piece of dirt he is?

[00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:05.280]
I've stepped on better things than him.

[00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:06.380]
I believe it.

[00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:07.620]
And had to throw my shoes out.

[00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:09.560]

[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:12.380]
Man, we're going to have that thousand before we shake of a lamestail.

[00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:14.300]
I wonder where that expression came from.

[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:15.480]
Probably at Michigan State.

[00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:17.320]
I don't know. There's a dictionary for things like that.

[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:20.480]
If Neil stops taking calls, I'll listen the same.

[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:21.600]
406.

[00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:23.300]

[00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:24.100]
See that?

[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:25.840]
If I stop taking calls.

[00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:29.080]
Now, we'll never, I mean, you know, we did that said months and didn't take any calls.

[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:32.020]
I'm not going to go, I'm going to go neck over that crazy.

[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:33.240]
And of course, you win.

[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:35.220]
You're on. You know, the calls to you are a crutch.

[00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:35.740]
Right.

[00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:38.920]
And of course, the crutch, it didn't really falls out from under your armpit.

[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:39.380]
That's right.

[00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:39.960]
That's right.

[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:42.360]
You keep coming back for more.

[00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:44.360]
The collar is suck. 126.

[00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:45.540]
See, put those two together.

[00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:47.100]

[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:49.280]
Holy moly rat man.

[00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:50.920]
There's almost 60% right there.

[00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:52.500]
I'll kill myself 76.

[00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:54.880]
Those are course out of people who this is their outlet.

[00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:57.540]
This is their reaching out to the human race.

[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:00.220]
I hate this poll 70.

[00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:01.640]
I'll listen less 59.

[00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:04.000]
Stop listing 39.

[00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:05.680]
4.3% will stop listening.

[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:06.980]
Well, we'll survive without you.

[00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:08.060]
Have a great life.

[00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:09.600]
I'll listen much less 33.

[00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:11.660]
I'll kiss the radio 30 when I'll kiss it.

[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:12.700]
As Bubba would say.

[00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:14.200]
I'll listen more 24.

[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:15.320]
And I'll listen much more.

[00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:17.360]
Much, much, much more 21.

[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:42.480]

[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:42.480]

[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:42.480]

[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:42.620]
This is our car.

[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:42.620]

[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:42.620]

[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:42.660]
This is our car.

[00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:43.480]
This is our car.

[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:43.600]
This is our car.

[00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:44.080]
This is our car.

[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:45.200]
This is our car.

[00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:47.020]
This is our car.

[00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:47.700]
This is our car.

[00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:48.680]
This is our car.

[00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:50.440]
This is our car.

[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:50.520]
This is our car.

[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:52.740]
This is our car.

[00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:56.000]
This is our car.

[00:58:58.500 --> 00:58:59.900]
This is our car.

[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:18.200]
This is our car.

[00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:20.660]
This is our car.

[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:22.120]
This is our car.

[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:22.140]
This is our car.

[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:22.140]

[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:22.140]

[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:22.140]

[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:22.140]

[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:22.160]
This is our car.

[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:22.160]

[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:22.160]

[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:22.160]

[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:22.160]

[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:22.160]

[00:59:22.180 --> 00:59:22.200]
This is our car.

[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:22.200]

[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:22.200]

[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:22.200]

[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:22.200]

[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:22.200]

[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:22.200]

[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:22.200]

[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:22.200]

[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:22.200]

[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:22.260]
This is our car.

[00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:23.840]
This is our car.

[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:24.840]
This is our car.

[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:25.800]
This is our car.

[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:48.940]
This is our car.

[00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:58.800]
Good day is your final

[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:02.200]
Good day is your final

[01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:06.100]
May you one, may you one

[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:10.940]
Got what you MCI

[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:14.020]
Got what you MCI

[01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:15.260]
Got what you MCI

[01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:19.800]
Got what you MCI

[01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:23.820]
And I will add a piece of the tape

[01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:27.600]
When you say goodbye is bad a day to day

[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:31.560]
When you say because I say don't be bad

[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:35.660]
You know it's a lie, it's all that'll be the day

[01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:38.780]
When I die, it's a piece of all you know

[01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:41.260]
You know, with all to respect, I don't want to pick on dead people

[01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:45.200]
But I think that's a really good pull. I'm going to make a note of that right now. I don't want to forget it.

[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:50.180]
So good pull idea. People who became highly overrated after their death.

[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:50.820]
Like Elvis?

[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:53.220]
Yeah, he was overrated before his death.

[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:56.680]
So in other words yes or no?

[01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:58.200]
Why not? Like Marilyn Monroe?

[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:03.420]
We got the one for tomorrow thanks to one of our listeners, Eric's already got it. I hope after their death.

[01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:07.220]
Buddy Holly, I mean, he was okay. He was good. That was a good idea.

[01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:10.680]
Well that's a good idea. He had Tangy Sue, he had Old Boy and he had that one then he died.

[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:14.500]
But his music was fine. No problem with it.

[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:16.060]
In fact that sounds like I don't even need a name.

[01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:17.840]
Well that is what I just said.

[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:21.900]
But in like Richie Valens, another one that you hate like poison.

[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:23.420]
Like Bomba. Right?

[01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:27.020]
As a matter of fact, speaking of Richie Valens, wouldn't surprise me.

[01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:29.080]
Oh, he liked that.

[01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:32.640]
And probably when I was sticking about it for Richie.

[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:37.260]
Don't get on the plane with Captain Harris Richie. Don't get on it.

[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:42.740]
Now let's see, was Richie Valens, he was on the same plane with Buddy Holly and the big bopper.

[01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:43.680]
That is correct. That is correct.

[01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:46.400]
Yes. Okay. And Cancer and Harris.

[01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:49.460]
You can put James Dean on that poll.

[01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:51.580]
Oh, okay. Let's see. Buddy Holly.

[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:57.260]
I don't want to be building that poll right now. I'm trying to do a brief radio show here before I go off to plunge my guts out.

[01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:57.820]
Elvis.

[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:00.840]
Marilyn Monroe. What else did we say?

[01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:02.340]
Marilyn Valens. Who?

[01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:03.080]
Marilyn Monroe.

[01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:05.460]
Marilyn Monroe. James Dean.

[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.060]
Well that's going to be a long list.

[01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:12.400]
People who all of a sudden became much more highly overrated after they died.

[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:19.220]
Anyway, look for the QM van right now at the Hooters Park in Laud on Pines and University to pick up a pair of free tickets to this afternoon's Marlon come to gain it the same.

[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:24.260]
There ought to be one fantastic crowd, man. You even have a blast with that crowd today at the Old Ball Park.

[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:26.780]
How many people do you think you're going to be there for an afternoon game?

[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:27.820]
About 30, man.

[01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:29.900]
Surprise everybody.

[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:34.340]
Marlon's are going for a clean sweep against those awful cubs, boy.

[01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:37.200]
The cubs must really be an awful, awful band for 50 years.

[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:38.480]
If they make it happen.

[01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:39.780]
You think that's going to happen?

[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:41.420]
Probably not.

[01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:43.600]
Now why do you say that? You have such little...

[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:49.220]
Well considering all the games they've won this year, I would say it's not a good odds that they speak to their ass on Monday, maybe.

[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:52.420]
No, Marlon's would. Marlon's would.

[01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:53.740]
Marlon's...

[01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:55.620]
Give me a thought there'd be a...

[01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:55.900]
Exactly.

[01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:57.240]
Anyone, what was it?

[01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:58.120]
5-4 last night?

[01:02:58.160 --> 01:02:59.480]
Was that the final score? 5-4?

[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:00.160]
I believe so.

[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:02.820]
That was also the final score on a hockey game last night.

[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:05.580]
Emton 5 and Anaheim mighty ducks four.

[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:09.760]
That was one of the most civil-aiding third periods I've seen in many months.

[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:11.140]
That was a great hockey boy.

[01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:16.900]
It always cracks me up every morning when Hank expects me to start hyperventilating about Shaq and Aheet.

[01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:17.960]
I don't care about it.

[01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:23.240]
Even if I tried, unless somebody paid me a lot of money, I can't pretend to care about something that I don't, including that crap.

[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:24.600]
Freak and street ball.

[01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:30.900]
All these seven-foot guys, Slime and Jam, and pretty soon I have ten-foot guys, who's heading to the top of the basket.

[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:33.240]
Who said it would be right at the rim if I can say that.

[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:33.960]
Can I say that?

[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:34.220]
No.

[01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:35.740]
Who said it would be right at the rim?

[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:37.980]
It's just ridiculous.

[01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:42.300]
It's basically almost like a step away from the WWF or goes on.

[01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:47.000]
In addition to which, if you really watch the NBA, and I have watched a few seconds here and there,

[01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:50.440]
the traveling that goes on now, I mean it takes like six giant steps.

[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:53.040]
How many steps do you have to take before it's called for a...

[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:54.120]
Stop turning me off.

[01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:55.740]
You know someone who's saying Josh?

[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:57.420]
Yes, three, but for Shaq it's six.

[01:03:57.780 --> 01:04:00.980]
He can take six giant steps because he's a monster in the...

[01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:03.640]
Plus, I think he's worth that I see sleeve.

[01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:06.020]
925 votes on a pull.

[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:08.420]
If Neil stops taking calls, I'll listen to the same 418.

[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.360]
Well, let's just see for the heck of it.

[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:11.480]
WQYM, hello.

[01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:12.500]
Mr. Neil.

[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:13.240]
Yes, sir.

[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:14.160]
Hey, how are you?

[01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:14.860]
It's pretty good.

[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:20.420]
The little poem that you're working on, for overrated after death, don't forget to put Ronald Reagan on that pull.

[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:21.540]
Oh, yeah, good one.

[01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:22.400]
Thank you, sir.

[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:23.280]
Excellent, thank you.

[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:23.760]
See?

[01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:25.820]
Well, I think I might have a point.

[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:27.420]
And the sea was that a good one?

[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:28.260]
Yes, we are.

[01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:29.760]
Four for four.

[01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:31.760]
Now you might say what I got it called earlier.

[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:32.420]
And he was good.

[01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:33.260]
No, he was just fine.

[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:33.940]
He was good.

[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:34.660]
He was honest.

[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:36.400]
He admitted he wanted to hear what he sounded like underrated.

[01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:38.860]
By the way, don't forget, pal, call me back tomorrow morning.

[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:41.640]
If you think you sounded okay, we'll give you two to four slot.

[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:43.680]
Not every day, we're still auditioning.

[01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:45.980]
Till about July next year.

[01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:48.500]
How long do you think this clara bell will clown?

[01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:50.440]
How long do you think his deal is?

[01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:52.260]
You see, basically, I just...

[01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:52.620]
I give up.

[01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:56.580]
Because, you know, normal kid, I guess since I sent the money, I guess that's the end of that.

[01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:56.980]
You know?

[01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:59.460]
Yeah, it's like feeding the dog.

[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:00.240]
You won't see it for a while.

[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:00.940]
That's right.

[01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:02.440]
He's got his cash now.

[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:05.200]
So he's out there cruising the boulevard or whatever he's doing.

[01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:06.740]
And I won't see him for a while.

[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.240]
I'm looking for runaways.

[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:09.540]
I have no idea what he's doing.

[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:11.160]
And that's it.

[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:14.520]
And clara bell, you know, he doesn't even darken our door anymore lately.

[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:17.220]
Am I right or am I wrong?

[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:19.140]
Oh, I'm sorry, I was trying to get a song going here.

[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:19.900]
I just mentioned it.

[01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:22.400]
Now, did we just play that yesterday?

[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:23.200]
Del Shannon?

[01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:24.440]
Can you hear it enough?

[01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:25.580]
Oh.

[01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:27.740]
Anyway, did I never give you a result?

[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:28.360]
I didn't pull by.

[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:29.400]
I stuck that other call in there.

[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:29.900]
It was excellent.

[01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:30.820]
It was good one for that pull.

[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.520]
We're going to be on Friday.

[01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:35.980]
If Neil stop taking calls, I'll listen the same as always.

[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:36.960]
425.

[01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:38.440]
Over 45% now.

[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:39.300]
45.2.

[01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:40.360]
Bless your soul.

[01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:42.740]
Oh, and they're starting again with this verb flu thing.

[01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:44.180]
They're starting to get everybody whipped up.

[01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:47.760]
Just after the yesterday when I said there's never been one case of human in which there has not.

[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:49.280]
And now, all a question mark.

[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:49.520]

[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:50.240]
Oh, look at this.

[01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:51.340]
Anderson Pooper.

[01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:53.560]
Did Jesus Christ exist at the Vinci Code?

[01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:54.820]
Who knows and who cares?

[01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:56.040]
You know, another Getchke.

[01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:58.040]
The caller is suck 134.

[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.120]
That's 14.4%.

[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:02.320]
So right there, like I said, at 60% right there.

[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:03.820]
Right from the get-go as they say.

[01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:04.720]
That was they say?

[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:05.180]
That was they say.

[01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:05.780]
They say get-go as they say.

[01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:07.820]
I'll kill myself.

[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:08.440]
79.

[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:09.640]
I have no life.

[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:11.240]
I hit this full 73.

[01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:12.760]
I'll listen less 72.

[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:13.960]
I'll stop listening.

[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:14.520]
39.

[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:15.060]
Damn it.

[01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:15.920]
4.1%.

[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:16.420]
Do you believe me?

[01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:16.760]
No.

[01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:18.320]
I'll listen much less.

[01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:19.260]
33.3.

[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:22.080]
I'm going to hear those really nifty callers.

[01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:22.740]
I can see that.

[01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:25.760]
The amazing part of it is that I put these on there

[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:27.680]
to give people an outlet, you know, like a place to go.

[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:29.400]
But if they really think that I believe that,

[01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:31.580]
it's just even I can't be that stupid.

[01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:33.260]
I'll kiss the radio 32.

[01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:34.780]
I'll listen more 25.

[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:36.860]
Listen much more 22.

[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:38.140]
I should have also put

[01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:39.820]
I'll listen much, much, much, much more, much more.

[01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:40.440]
Should I?

[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:40.940]
Right.

[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:41.400]
No.

[01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:43.240]
We already got 929 by noon.

[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:44.140]
We'll have that 1000.

[01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:44.780]
We'll have it licked.

[01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:45.780]
Aren't you impressed?

[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:47.020]
I know you're not impressed.

[01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:48.620]
I'm moderately impressed.

[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:50.580]
I'm actually Josh who's just blown away by it.

[01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:51.380]
I am shocked.

[01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:51.380]

[01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:52.020]
I'm shocked.

[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:54.600]
You know, see, I think that on these days when we,

[01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:55.720]
and you want to know why?

[01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:58.560]
Because what the audience does, because we have a very large,

[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:00.480]
forget about the callers, I'm talking about the listeners,

[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:02.600]
the normal people, early some of them.

[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:04.660]
What they do on these when we have the ball game,

[01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:07.260]
they listen a lot more between 10 and 1230.

[01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:08.840]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:09.540]
Mm-hmm.

[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:11.680]
They listen much faster, faster.

[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:13.240]
They concentrate much harder.

[01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:14.340]
They hang on every word.

[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:16.420]
And they like turn it up like twice as loud.

[01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:18.420]
They compensate for the fact that

[01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:19.240]
it's a constant question.

[01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:20.180]
Yeah.

[01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:22.360]
They had Alex Trebek, your buddy on there,

[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:25.120]
before for the national spelling bee contest winner,

[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:25.760]
something like that.

[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:26.960]
See what I tell you about him?

[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:27.580]
Sued.

[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:28.140]
What?

[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:28.760]
That's an old one.

[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:31.420]
What's all the scene about American jeopardy?

[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:32.080]
He's a Canadian.

[01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:33.580]
He's kind of like Neil Young.

[01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:35.340]
But he's still the world's all the same up there.

[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:36.820]
We could play that twice, Neil Young,

[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:38.300]
and we could be right up to the ball game.

[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:39.520]
We could play till we're old.

[01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:40.880]
Let's impeach the president.

[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.560]
Well, I got a hit start.

[01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:44.680]
You know, sometimes it's the things you can't see

[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:45.360]
that can hurt you.

[01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:46.880]

[01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:04.660]
being soaking like wet for hours and days,

[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:06.040]
like with the other joints.

[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:07.600]
Your carpets stay clean longer.

How the heck did Barry's muscles grow?

[01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:19.140]
He was a shrimp dolly when he went to a balcony.

[01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:24.960]
I hit home runs thanks to the juice.

[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:29.060]

You beat me with turning tracks.

[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:09.560]

You're going to miss what's happening every night.

[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:41.600]
You're going to miss something expensive that's kind of safe.

[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:44.120]
So make sure you don't get what's right in your way.

[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:48.060]
Just get tune, turn it up, you idiot.

[01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:48.340]
n

[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:04.460]
to

[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:10.720]
Sammy

[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:22.420]
Oh, it doesn't say I'm here what year, not a bitch, but I bet you if I go to the insulator

[01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:26.120]
It'll say I don't know what you think it must it does

[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:32.360]
The diamonds little girl 1957 I was close if you're within one year close enough. It's okay

[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:35.400]
But anyway the original head on that was by the gladiolas

[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:40.480]
Which was much much better and maybe you got that there I doubt I don't it's too old

[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:44.560]
I'm gonna go and give it one of these days soon. Although I have been updating with the oldies

[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:48.080]
You know that collection that's back here that's incomplete people pick through it already oldies

[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:53.080]
But goldies but goodies whatever you're putting them in the computer slowly bit surely well, but so that's on air

[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:57.380]
But probably the one by the diamonds like I just played anyway the gladiolas had the original head on that

[01:11:57.380 --> 01:12:02.520]
There was much much better version the diamonds as you just heard it's very campy and it's just you know

[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:07.680]
It sucks, but they had the bigger head because the diamonds were on mercury records. I don't know if I put the gladiola version

[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:12.100]
You never did I might have I don't know I'd have to get it if it's the last damn thing I do

[01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:14.460]
I'm gonna go out and get it all right. I

[01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:15.500]
I

[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:19.940]
Just sent a message to a blob over an email during the break. I just I just feel insufficient

[01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:22.520]
You know there you're I'm just not good at that kind of thing

[01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:26.180]
I don't know if anybody is good at that kind of thing. We're just unfortunate

[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:33.380]
26-new and so anybody who is a elacid or list of your fan you probably want to check out of a blog last a couple of days and check out

[01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:34.360]
What's going on? It's not good

[01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:39.260]
Proported been law-demessage mousseau a not part of 9-11 a website message

[01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:41.440]
Proportedly for most some of it love and says that neither

[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:45.780]
Zakarius mousseau a or is it Zakarius or is it Zakiraya?

[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:50.940]
They pronounce it about either for that mousseau a guy with a bald head neither him or any of the prisoners at the West

[01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:56.260]
Prison in Guantanamo, but had anything to do with the attacks of 9-11 the auto-todd message in Arabic

[01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:59.200]
Included in English translation in subtitles that said

[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:03.140]
Casa hois earlier this month the federal jury sentenced mousseau a well

[01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:08.140]
We know that although it wasn't charged with direct involvement in the plot prosecutors itself that that penalty he didn't get it

[01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:11.320]
He got life in prison with no possibility of parole some

[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:17.180]
508 ease from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are being held at the getmo naval base and then of course

[01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:22.300]
They're all those that Abu Garret last month a complete version of bin Laden's most recent audio message appeared on his

[01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:28.520]
Islamist website four days after experts appear excerpts appeared on the Arabic language TV channel Al Jazeera

[01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:33.540]
And it goes on about this and about the cartoons of Mohammed and all this other

[01:13:33.940 --> 01:13:39.140]
Kakarai man all this nonsense don't forget look for the QM van right now and who does parking lot at Pines University

[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:47.980]
I guarantee you that and because it's cloudy. I don't know it's gonna be 87

[01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:51.520]
It's not gonna be there. You're gonna like bacon frying the Sun is it bacon and frying?

[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:55.920]
I don't know probably are they bacon it or frying it? Well, I mean 87 more be there or fine

[01:13:55.920 --> 01:14:00.000]
But at least if it's not sunny, it's like you're gonna get just like fried leave it a big tumor

[01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:03.100]
958 votes. I'm gonna tell you right now

[01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:08.720]
Let me just refresh that and take a look at what the odds are. I mean the thousands are given 963

[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:13.220]
Our goal right now is 80 million dollars for the charity and we want to get to a thousand by noon

[01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:16.600]
Speaking of the charity we didn't even get 25 grand yet for our about 30

[01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:23.300]
There are no words to describe it. It's so mortifying and humiliating and degrading

[01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:29.560]
That's the level to which we still to a Q.A.M. and the meantime everybody is from our management to our agents to our

[01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:35.260]
Everybody they're all like in suspended animation or like frozen in other like Ted Williams head

[01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:39.980]
They're all like that cash and build your presence freezer frozen. I mean, what are we gonna do?

[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:45.540]
How are we gonna solve these bastards out? I just run out are we take more calls? So did no we're not gonna take more calls

[01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:48.200]
We'll take a while. I'll take a call when I feel good and ready to take call

[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:50.940]
You know I was kidding and they gonna happen. I know you're kidding

[01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:59.700]
But I just just rub it ruffles my dander whatever that is. Yeah, I've been there hackles up. Yeah, that's it that too my hackles and my

[01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:01.140]
tackles

[01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:05.740]
And anyway, we got that big ballgame coming up. I better get with it here. I better start

[01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:08.780]
You know because I'm I'm used to sitting here very

[01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:14.220]
Comley but we got a lot of pressure today when you have only just two and a half hours and wait till Monday

[01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:16.420]
Man you ain't see nothing yet like the blues the goose said

[01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:21.740]
Right, I think I have that here in my collection. We haven't seen nothing yet by the blues my goose my goose

[01:15:21.740 --> 01:15:25.580]
But Monday only got two hours 10 to noon. So you're gonna have to be pressure packed on Monday

[01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:30.000]
You have to take a million calls on Monday and of course on Labor Day. You can I wear a more whatever day

[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:34.960]
I say 1968 or not

[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:37.720]

Let's see. Seven. See again within one year and the board goes back

[01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:45.100]
And still talking to me. Can't hear it

[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:57.420]
That was okay. That was a good time and 67 through was 70 mid 60s through the 70s in fact 50s 56 to 80

[01:15:57.420 --> 01:16:01.540]
That's when the good music came out. I'm obviously there are some exceptions few

[01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:04.860]
Oh, guess what I don't have on my iPod what I did not

[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:09.120]
Transfer on her yet and probably won't and you're gonna laugh what I tell you all right

[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:11.980]
Well, I sat next to him and would buy oh

[01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:17.880]
Your your guess who yeah, now you probably never knew a bigger guess who fan than me. I mean, I just love it

[01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:24.140]
Yes, maybe me well there you go, but I got to be honest with you in fact when I hear their music playing anywhere

[01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:27.840]
Now I just I have a different altitude about it. Not that I don't like the music

[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:33.320]
It's still working here, but meeting him and I didn't really meet him officially, but I mean it was him

[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:37.640]
Yeah, and having them sit there next to me playing that machine with his young

[01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:41.560]
Partner there is daughter white for whoever she was

[01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:45.660]
Partner day or whoever

[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:51.660]
He was just a jackass and that just is curing me and I should not have any bearing on whether I like the music

[01:16:54.020 --> 01:16:58.960]
But it does I know I still like the music. I just want to hear it for a while. I just need a rest from him from your brother

[01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:04.600]
Okay, that's enough. I need a rest. See your your sadistic fast-dune is what you are

[01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:06.780]
One of your wife hates you like poison

[01:17:07.740 --> 01:17:09.440]
I'm just trying to poison the cornflakes

[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:14.440]
I'm 169 votes. I think we got a shot at that thousand by the top of the hour when little hand it's the big end

[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:18.640]
It's parents ever come back in there give you the rub down. I mean to run down on Monday. No, but why not?

[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:23.680]
I guess it's what it works way back through the system. Oh work its way back through my ass

[01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:27.660]
Give me a break way to long way. Yeah, come on

[01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:31.700]

Which means it's probably a bokeh this down there. You think I'm gonna run right down and get it? No, probably not

[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:58.820]
There's a liberty in fact if I played my cards right and ran down there and got it by the time I got back

[01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:02.860]
It was never to ballgame away. I'm not gonna do that though. I'm I'm putting my notes to the grindstone

[01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:07.080]
I'm gonna succeed in spite of these bastards not because of them, but in spite of them

Let's not save

[01:20:59.190 --> 01:21:04.410]
Who will win for this man?

[01:21:17.190 --> 01:21:19.170]
Children inside baby, die with rain

Give them die with rain don't shine

[01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:25.910]

Give them die with rain don't shine

[01:21:30.650 --> 01:21:33.130]
Give them die with rain don't shine

[01:21:33.130 --> 01:21:35.970]
I think there's a couple of them like that

[01:21:35.970 --> 01:21:39.310]
but the songs that are named after the artist

[01:21:39.310 --> 01:21:41.830]
Bow didly by Bow Didly

[01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:43.750]
There's another one I can't think of what it is

[01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:44.570]
I'll think of it

[01:21:44.570 --> 01:21:45.210]
Oh or not

[01:21:45.210 --> 01:21:46.770]
Ellen also do me a favor

[01:21:46.770 --> 01:21:47.230]
Sure

[01:21:47.230 --> 01:21:48.850]
I'm sure you keep track of all these things

[01:21:49.550 --> 01:21:50.750]
Last year's email

[01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:51.390]
Yes

[01:21:51.390 --> 01:21:52.410]
Did you got that?

[01:21:52.690 --> 01:21:52.890]
Yes

[01:21:52.890 --> 01:21:55.090]
Because I sent a message and I just got that post-master

[01:21:55.090 --> 01:21:56.210]
You don't know if they have failed to deliver

[01:21:56.210 --> 01:21:58.430]
So I must have sent to the wrong email address

[01:21:58.430 --> 01:21:59.390]
Because I'm doing it by memory

[01:21:59.390 --> 01:22:00.270]
And I must have been wrong

[01:22:00.270 --> 01:22:02.070]
See if you got it in the facts of the made

[01:22:02.070 --> 01:22:02.650]
Don't put it on the list

[01:22:02.650 --> 01:22:02.790]
Okay

[01:22:03.330 --> 01:22:06.910]
Senator Chris Dodd said yesterday he decided to do all the things that are necessary

[01:22:06.910 --> 01:22:08.810]
To prepare to seek the presidency in 2008

[01:22:08.810 --> 01:22:09.550]
Good man

[01:22:09.550 --> 01:22:12.850]
But where was he and all his other fellow senators in so many cases?

[01:22:12.850 --> 01:22:13.730]
You know where were they?

[01:22:13.870 --> 01:22:14.670]
He good man, no

[01:22:14.670 --> 01:22:16.410]
Connecticut Democrat will hire staff

[01:22:16.410 --> 01:22:18.330]
Raise money and travel around the country in the next few months

[01:22:18.330 --> 01:22:19.310]
As he fragile in the support

[01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:20.650]
And you don't even know who he is

[01:22:20.650 --> 01:22:21.850]
That's kind of scary to me

[01:22:21.850 --> 01:22:23.050]
Chris Dodd

[01:22:23.050 --> 01:22:24.030]
He looks like Jerry Williams

[01:22:24.030 --> 01:22:25.150]
Although he's not dead

[01:22:25.150 --> 01:22:26.790]
Like other presidential contenders

[01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:28.010]
Dodd said during a lengthy interview

[01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:28.970]
And his capital hill office

[01:22:28.970 --> 01:22:31.030]
Then he will not formally decide until early next year

[01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:32.290]
Whether to make his bid official

[01:22:32.290 --> 01:22:33.110]
At the moment

[01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:35.550]
He joins about ten other major Democratic Party figures

[01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:36.370]
Or considering a run

[01:22:36.370 --> 01:22:39.290]
The ob came closer running in 2004 but never ended the race

[01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:40.950]
Circumstances are different today

[01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:42.290]
He's not up for a election to ascend at seat

[01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:45.030]
And his colleague, Julie Lieberman, is not running for president

[01:22:45.030 --> 01:22:47.310]
And has got his own bad fish to fry in a Connecticut

[01:22:47.310 --> 01:22:48.670]
He's got some real service there

[01:22:48.670 --> 01:22:49.130]
Luckily

[01:22:49.130 --> 01:22:50.170]
Thanks God

[01:22:50.830 --> 01:22:52.950]
Now if anybody thinks I'm answering that line nine

[01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:55.990]
During this you know infrequent phone call thing here

[01:22:55.990 --> 01:22:56.790]
You're dreaming

[01:22:56.790 --> 01:22:58.170]
Hey look for the QM van

[01:22:58.170 --> 01:22:59.270]
Right now as I speak

[01:22:59.270 --> 01:23:01.810]
You have a chance to go out to the ballgame this afternoon for free

[01:23:01.810 --> 01:23:04.550]
The van is at the Hooters Park and Lauderd Ponds in University

[01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:05.570]
Just stop by there

[01:23:05.570 --> 01:23:08.450]
Pick up a pair of free tickets to the Saftones Marlins and Cubs game

[01:23:08.450 --> 01:23:09.950]
As the Marlins fight to make a sweep

[01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:11.330]
And win three in a row

[01:23:11.330 --> 01:23:13.090]
Wouldn't that be a feather in their crap huh?

[01:23:13.390 --> 01:23:14.130]
Hmm, that'd be something

[01:23:14.130 --> 01:23:16.130]
I've said ever go a long way to rebuilding that stadium

[01:23:16.130 --> 01:23:16.590]
Don't you think?

[01:23:16.750 --> 01:23:16.870]
No

[01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:17.270]
Not

[01:23:17.270 --> 01:23:23.030]
The FCC, the anxious FCC which has all the power in the world to find everybody

[01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:25.130]
80-kz dollars if we say crap

[01:23:25.130 --> 01:23:27.950]
Has told the Democratic Congressmen they cannot investigate

[01:23:27.950 --> 01:23:30.870]
The National Security Agency's domestic data mining program

[01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:32.310]
Because it's classified

[01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:35.250]
And letter to Massachusetts Democrat Ed Markey

[01:23:35.250 --> 01:23:38.270]
FCC chairman, the anxious Kevin Martin said the program

[01:23:38.270 --> 01:23:40.850]
Could not be scrutinized because it was classified

[01:23:40.850 --> 01:23:44.590]
In this case, however, the classified nature of the NSA's activities

[01:23:44.590 --> 01:23:49.010]
Makes us unable to investigate the alleged violation discussed in your letter with this time rights Martin

[01:23:49.010 --> 01:23:52.270]
The representations of Director of National Intelligence, John Agroponny

[01:23:52.270 --> 01:23:54.790]
And NSA Director General Alexander make it clear

[01:23:54.790 --> 01:23:57.990]
That it would be not possible for us to investigate the activities described in the other

[01:23:57.990 --> 01:24:01.050]
Without examining highly sensitive classified information

[01:24:01.050 --> 01:24:05.410]
The commission has no power to order the production of classified information

[01:24:05.410 --> 01:24:10.930]
In his response, Markey chastised the FCC for refusing to demand answers

[01:24:10.930 --> 01:24:14.790]
We can't have a situation where the FCC charged with enforcing the law

[01:24:14.790 --> 01:24:17.670]
Would even begin an investigation of apparent violations of law

[01:24:17.670 --> 01:24:22.570]
Because if the prediction will roadblock any investigation citing national security, Markey said

[01:24:22.570 --> 01:24:27.750]
If the FCC initiates an investigation against Black by the White House, then the White House is stonewalling

[01:24:27.750 --> 01:24:32.650]
But if the FCC refuses even to demand answers, then the White House never has to block enforcement agencies

[01:24:32.650 --> 01:24:35.570]
Even from the end of the bottom of this, the American people deserve answers, he said

[01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:36.970]
And hold your breath and your mama

[01:24:36.970 --> 01:24:38.050]
How you like that?

[01:24:38.610 --> 01:24:42.490]
Although it hasn't taken too long, but the rumors are starting already

[01:24:42.490 --> 01:24:45.750]
Wait till you're this, hang on to your both sides of your chair with both hands

[01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:47.110]
Get a firm grasp

[01:24:47.650 --> 01:24:49.490]
Let me check this thing first over here

[01:24:49.490 --> 01:24:53.350]
Uh-oh, we're going to have that thousand and then some by noon

[01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:54.810]
Are you excited or what?

[01:24:55.190 --> 01:24:58.110]
Media, 1995. I'm so excited I got my shirt and pants on

[01:24:58.110 --> 01:25:00.110]
Shoes coming very soon, no socks

[01:25:00.110 --> 01:25:01.930]
Is there trouble in Tomcatland?

[01:25:01.930 --> 01:25:03.450]
Can you believe this?

[01:25:03.730 --> 01:25:04.230]
Oh no

[01:25:04.230 --> 01:25:11.270]
Tom Cruisencandy Homes reportedly got into a big fight that ended with Homes deciding to take baby's Surrey to Ohio

[01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:13.770]
To introduce the two-month-old to family and friends

[01:25:13.770 --> 01:25:17.970]
Tom who is rumored to have a rocky relationship with Homes, Homes is his parents

[01:25:17.970 --> 01:25:23.210]
Won't be joining them, according to life and style weekly, one of my very favorite publications

[01:25:23.210 --> 01:25:25.990]
He told Kate, did you ever find that email in your mouth?

[01:25:26.010 --> 01:25:26.490]
Yes, honestly

[01:25:26.490 --> 01:25:27.910]
Oh, thank you

[01:25:27.910 --> 01:25:32.290]
He told Katie he wasn't going, considering the bad relations between him and her family and insider told the magazine

[01:25:32.290 --> 01:25:38.050]
Katie was really happy you said that because she'd been afraid to admit him to him that she didn't want him to go

[01:25:38.050 --> 01:25:39.970]
Did you follow that? No, but I'm not going to read it

[01:25:39.970 --> 01:25:45.150]
The couple allegedly had a huge argument which ended with Katie declaring, I'm doing this and you can't stop me

[01:25:45.150 --> 01:25:46.750]
Her representative denied this story

[01:25:47.470 --> 01:25:53.010]
Cruisencandy reportedly decided to fly his fiance and taught two Toledo throughout them off and fly back to pick them up

[01:25:53.010 --> 01:25:57.350]
This episode however may be giving home a second thought, say confident of her told the magazine

[01:25:57.350 --> 01:26:02.730]
Katie is very unhappy and beginning to realize she may have made a major mistake

[01:26:02.730 --> 01:26:05.730]
A major mistake being with Tom

[01:26:05.730 --> 01:26:06.710]
Yeah, I could have told you that

[01:26:07.310 --> 01:26:08.850]
Huh? She wouldn't listen to me

[01:26:08.850 --> 01:26:11.670]
How do you like that? For some heavy-duty crap

[01:26:11.670 --> 01:26:14.250]
Well, speaking of crap, what do you do this? New Delhi?

[01:26:14.710 --> 01:26:18.090]
Not the Raskal House or the Delhi then? New Delhi, India

[01:26:18.090 --> 01:26:22.850]
Some Indian Christians are so uncensed with the fictional blockbuster, the Vinci Code

[01:26:22.850 --> 01:26:30.130]
They want the government to ban it and one Roman Catholic has offered a bounty on of 25,000 on the head of author Dan Brown

[01:26:30.130 --> 01:26:33.610]
Doesn't this sound awfully familiar? Yeah, like the satanic verses

[01:26:33.610 --> 01:26:37.110]
Right, leaving other members of the faithful embarrassed by the reaction

[01:26:37.110 --> 01:26:43.470]
The Mumbai Catholic Council has threatened to stop the screening of the movie if the government fails to ban the recently released movie of the book

[01:26:43.470 --> 01:26:49.510]
Another group called the Catholic Social Form has said that if the show is going to hit, it will launch a death fast from the 12th of May

[01:26:49.510 --> 01:26:52.510]
Well, the 12th of May is like 10 years ago, so maybe they did by now

[01:26:52.510 --> 01:26:57.330]
Oh, I see, this article is from the 11th of May, but it just finally made it

[01:26:57.970 --> 01:27:04.890]
Nicholas Almated, a Catholic and former Mumbai municipal counselor, offered a reward of 25,000 dollars, 1.1 million rupees

[01:27:04.890 --> 01:27:09.570]
For the head of author Brown, leaving a Catholic journalist to compare Almated to the Taliban

[01:27:09.570 --> 01:27:16.790]
Still the autonomous Delhi commission for minorities joined Christian groups like the All India Christian Council calling for a ban on the movie

[01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:26.630]
The commission said that the Vinci Code is sheer blasphemy in that it has deeply upset Christian sentiments in appealing on the 10th of May to the federal sense of board to deny screening permission for the movie

[01:27:26.630 --> 01:27:31.950]
In a country like ours where vicious propaganda is used against Christian matterities by Hindu bigots

[01:27:31.950 --> 01:27:38.010]
The movie will be handy for them to turnish our image, Arnold James, a church of North Injie member and Christian representative in the commission told

[01:27:38.010 --> 01:27:42.490]
Echiminal, another one of my favorite magazines, Echim Medical News International, I never missed that

[01:27:44.110 --> 01:27:48.050]
Archbishop Stanislaus Fernandez, Secretary General of the Catholic Christians Conference of India, said

[01:27:48.050 --> 01:27:54.990]
The fictional work be little is what is it the heart of Christian faith and cherished in Christian life, all of these bubble-mices and a statement objecting to the release of the movie

[01:27:54.990 --> 01:27:58.010]
Every individual has to write to his religion's beliefs and to enjoy the respect

[01:27:58.010 --> 01:28:03.650]
Oh see this is wrong and to enjoy the respect to them from the followers of other religions, no no you don't

[01:28:03.650 --> 01:28:07.410]
Where is that written? Sorry, yeah, how do you like that?

[01:28:07.650 --> 01:28:10.270]
See this is where they go wrong, this is where they make the bad mistake

[01:28:10.270 --> 01:28:14.090]
Not only you have to allow us to believe whatever we want, what you were entitled to do

[01:28:14.090 --> 01:28:18.710]
But then you have to respect this for believing about just sitting on a sentence, no we don't, you're silly and we're allowed to say something

[01:28:19.350 --> 01:28:22.050]
You're idiots, oh see I, thank you very much

[01:28:22.050 --> 01:28:28.230]
I had the wrong thing, dumb and a butter, we do that all over again, why the hell did I delete that?

[01:28:28.410 --> 01:28:31.550]
Because I'm dumb, it's already in your sent mail just cut and paste it in

[01:28:31.550 --> 01:28:33.690]
Where do you relax? Just calm down

[01:28:36.510 --> 01:28:41.610]
I'm gonna go put my shoes on in a minute, by the way it was a UPS package and it was money due on it

[01:28:41.610 --> 01:28:46.130]
I'm gonna say right now a damn well better not to be

[01:28:47.530 --> 01:28:49.890]
If it's, if it's no comment

[01:28:51.610 --> 01:28:57.450]
Thousand and four votes on the pool man, we better do this break real pronto tonto because we got three of them coming up for the next half hour

[01:28:57.450 --> 01:29:02.210]
By the way if you got anything busy that you got a new day or even not just not been nice knowing you

[01:29:02.210 --> 01:29:04.550]
Because the next half hour is all spots radio

[01:29:04.550 --> 01:29:09.910]
If Neil stops taking calls I'll listen the same as ever, 452 and even 45%

[01:29:09.910 --> 01:29:13.210]
The caller is suck, 144, 14 and point 2%

[01:29:13.210 --> 01:29:18.650]
I'll kill myself 86, promise? I'll listen less 78, I hate this pool 76

[01:29:19.210 --> 01:29:23.970]
Stop, I'll stop listening 44, 4.3% of this audience are PO'd man

[01:29:23.970 --> 01:29:26.350]
Although we took a couple calls today, three I think, didn't we?

[01:29:26.630 --> 01:29:26.870]
Okay

[01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:30.950]
And we still got 35 minutes to go, never know, it might take another one but probably not

[01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:38.950]
I'll listen much less 40, kiss the radio 34, listen more 27 and listen much more 23, 20 trace

[01:29:39.310 --> 01:29:40.290]
That is citing your one

[01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:41.110]
Okay

[01:29:42.090 --> 01:29:46.050]
1155, don't forget we got that big cub marlin game coming up pregame at 1230 this afternoon

[01:29:46.050 --> 01:29:49.230]
I know I'm not forgetting, I'm on the edge of my seat almost out the door

[01:29:49.230 --> 01:29:53.290]

[01:31:08.030 --> 01:31:09.870]

For a goal

[01:31:19.750 --> 01:31:20.670]
For a goal

[01:31:20.670 --> 01:31:24.670]
Hi everybody, that was me, I'm the voice of the pig

[01:31:26.410 --> 01:31:28.170]
How you doing up there in Pokémon?

[01:31:28.910 --> 01:31:30.970]
It's in the paladins of your face, huh?

[01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:32.770]
Told you I did it timeslot

[01:31:34.030 --> 01:31:37.990]
Now I'm gonna change the face of budget conscious sport whole radio

[01:31:37.990 --> 01:31:42.330]
Starting with an interview with a generic sport host, Puffer

[01:31:42.330 --> 01:31:45.450]
I don't like to buy your under the air since the team

[01:31:45.450 --> 01:31:49.230]
I don't matter who this is, because they all sound alike

[01:31:49.230 --> 01:31:51.210]
Call it J, do what I say

[01:31:51.210 --> 01:31:53.830]
That's been doing this interview with me

[01:31:53.830 --> 01:31:57.070]
I'll make 100% effort to perform well

[01:31:57.070 --> 01:32:01.930]
Say yes, how come all you sports guys are like that? So fast you were sitting there?

[01:32:02.290 --> 01:32:02.790]
Stupid

[01:32:02.790 --> 01:32:11.210]
Well, we have to go to college, but never really attend classes just like not too smart is the situation we have

[01:32:11.210 --> 01:32:16.370]
You think Raven about male athletes and worshipping their jobstaps is a little laugh?

[01:32:17.850 --> 01:32:21.270]
Just a little under curious eyes?

[01:32:22.050 --> 01:32:26.590]
Maybe, stretch it out after seeing a few tight butts, you know what it is?

[01:32:26.810 --> 01:32:28.870]
We're like women, we're programmed to do so

[01:32:28.870 --> 01:32:31.810]
You hate this station, outside of one show

[01:32:32.370 --> 01:32:34.710]
You ever hear anyone talk about girls?

[01:32:35.890 --> 01:32:37.430]
It is a little weird

[01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:44.350]
There are two or three very lonely men with very small things who need to hear this

[01:32:44.350 --> 01:32:46.870]
But you say you're not sports is that?

[01:32:47.050 --> 01:32:48.350]
What day?

[01:32:50.670 --> 01:32:51.870]
You're MCM

[01:32:52.870 --> 01:32:56.890]
Translates, fans, you never lose the best guys

[01:32:57.550 --> 01:33:04.130]
Oh, it just isn't what I really meant to play was

[01:33:04.130 --> 01:33:05.250]
That?

[01:33:05.630 --> 01:33:06.370]
Okay, there we go

[01:33:06.370 --> 01:33:07.290]
Sorry

[01:33:09.370 --> 01:33:13.930]
Oh, yeah, I'm the great free champion

[01:33:17.550 --> 01:33:20.290]
Pretending that I'm giving well

[01:33:21.090 --> 01:33:25.570]
Oh, wait till you're this fast it just came in, Uncle Leo will the WQM fan have any copies of your CD?

[01:33:26.090 --> 01:33:28.930]
And could you please you print where it's going to be? I'm not really interested in pre-Marlin tickets

[01:33:28.930 --> 01:33:31.370]
Would I like to buy one of your CDs? Well, guess what, Pally?

[01:33:31.770 --> 01:33:35.170]
It's at the right now at the Hooters parking lot I assume it's still there, am I right? Yes

[01:33:35.170 --> 01:33:40.350]
At the corner of Pines University and you can pick up a pair of free tickets to the Seventh-Mins Marlin Cup game

[01:33:40.350 --> 01:33:43.950]
Or the Best Niela about third on CD or T-shirt

[01:33:43.950 --> 01:33:45.090]
Or both about the T-shirt

[01:33:45.090 --> 01:33:48.310]
Have a good friend or both you can get tickets to NDA CD

[01:33:48.310 --> 01:33:50.330]
Yeah, or in other words

[01:33:50.330 --> 01:33:52.470]
Whatever you want to be one of them, you want to pay God

[01:33:52.470 --> 01:33:53.850]
They probably have the shirts too, I'm sure

[01:33:53.850 --> 01:33:57.390]
They probably have the shirts and if not they'll give you the shirt off their back

[01:33:57.390 --> 01:33:58.830]
Which will not be a pretty sight

[01:33:58.830 --> 01:34:01.170]
Why does this thing keep coming up here?

[01:34:01.170 --> 01:34:03.750]
Oh, just honest to God

[01:34:03.750 --> 01:34:05.890]
Oh, I'm just having a little computer, right?

[01:34:06.930 --> 01:34:09.070]
There we go, everything's just fine

[01:34:09.890 --> 01:34:14.790]
Iran conducted a test launch last night of the She-Hob 3 Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile

[01:34:14.790 --> 01:34:17.770]
Which is capable of reaching Israel and US targets in the region

[01:34:18.450 --> 01:34:18.930]
Oiii!

[01:34:19.010 --> 01:34:22.650]
Israeli radio reported the test came hours before Prime Minister Aehud Olmer

[01:34:22.650 --> 01:34:25.990]
But when the US President George W. Washington to discuss the Iranian threat

[01:34:25.990 --> 01:34:31.150]
Military officials said it wasn't clear if there's most recent test in the Cabinet advance in the capabilities of the She-Hob 3

[01:34:31.150 --> 01:34:36.210]
They said the test was like, in fact this particular missile is like little like headgears in it

[01:34:36.210 --> 01:34:37.930]
They like pop out when they're there

[01:34:37.930 --> 01:34:41.330]
They said the test was likely time to coincide with the Washington Summit

[01:34:41.330 --> 01:34:45.970]
And with comments made by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah during celebrations in Beirut

[01:34:45.970 --> 01:34:49.370]
marking the sixth anniversary of the Israel withdrawal from southern Lebanon

[01:34:49.370 --> 01:34:51.010]
And a partridge in the period three

[01:34:51.010 --> 01:34:54.090]
And like I said, if you was Israelis and all you Arab-al-Uraghids

[01:34:54.090 --> 01:34:57.230]
If you want to kill each other, go ahead just leave us out, leave us out of it

[01:34:57.230 --> 01:34:58.050]
Please, I beg it

[01:34:58.050 --> 01:35:00.250]
I'm-no, it's a fair solution

[01:35:00.250 --> 01:35:01.230]
It's all I ask

[01:35:01.230 --> 01:35:02.630]
It's all we need

[01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:09.070]
I just can't believe what's going on but nevertheless, whereas I want to make sure I got all this stuff down where it's supposed to be

[01:35:09.070 --> 01:35:12.090]
Because we only got like 28 minutes until the Marlon pre-game show

[01:35:12.090 --> 01:35:12.670]
God!

[01:35:13.490 --> 01:35:16.670]
Is President Bush likely to see Al-Boer's documentary about global warming?

[01:35:16.890 --> 01:35:17.030]
No!

[01:35:17.230 --> 01:35:17.370]
No!

[01:35:17.570 --> 01:35:19.550]
Doubt it! Bush said very cool-y this week

[01:35:19.550 --> 01:35:20.290]
Doubt it!

[01:35:20.490 --> 01:35:22.090]
He also said that, y'all

[01:35:22.890 --> 01:35:23.730]
It's hard work

[01:35:23.730 --> 01:35:25.830]
But Bush should watch it, Gourg Shot back

[01:35:25.830 --> 01:35:29.570]
In fact, the former Democratic Vice President offered to come to the White House any time any day

[01:35:29.570 --> 01:35:35.350]
To show Bush either his documentary or a slideshow on global warming that he showed more than a thousand times around the world

[01:35:35.350 --> 01:35:38.390]
Can you imagine Al-Gourg showing Gourg George Bush a slideshow?

[01:35:38.490 --> 01:35:40.430]
Maybe if he turned it into a coloring book

[01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:44.970]
Or maybe if it had like scenes from my pet goat

[01:35:44.970 --> 01:35:51.010]
The entire global scientific community has a consensus on the question that human beings are responsible for global warming

[01:35:51.010 --> 01:35:54.250]
And he has to again express personal doubt that that is true, Gourg said

[01:35:54.250 --> 01:35:59.410]
In an interview from France where he attended a Cannes Film Festival, Al-Gourg is in the Cannes

[01:35:59.410 --> 01:36:01.890]
And judging from the size of him lately, he'll be in there a long time

[01:36:01.890 --> 01:36:05.090]
Bush and Gourg have had bitter disagreements about the environment and other issues

[01:36:05.090 --> 01:36:06.010]
Ayadi-Adi

[01:36:06.590 --> 01:36:11.670]
Gourg's documentary on the Ant-Can be Neat truth Chronicles is efforts to bring greater attention to dangers of climate change

[01:36:11.670 --> 01:36:14.050]
Speaking of that, it's a good segue

[01:36:14.050 --> 01:36:19.270]
The BBC reports, or he's getting off a newsy this arm where he could be taken some really good calls

[01:36:19.270 --> 01:36:25.810]
Global temperatures will rise further in the future than previous studies have indicated according to new research from two scientific teams

[01:36:25.810 --> 01:36:26.990]
The Cubs and the Mets

[01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:34.310]
They both use historical records to calculate the likely amplification of warming as higher temperatures induced release of CO2 from ecosystems

[01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:39.470]
They both conclude that current estimates of warming are too low by anything up to 75%

[01:36:39.470 --> 01:36:42.570]
Their conclusion is backed up by a new report from the Australian government

[01:36:42.570 --> 01:36:47.050]
The Australian greenhouse offices, current estimates of temperature rise are being challenged by new research

[01:36:47.590 --> 01:36:53.810]
The study predicts the global average temperature would rise between 1.5 Celsius and 4.5 degrees Celsius

[01:36:53.810 --> 01:36:57.150]
If human activities were to double the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

[01:36:57.150 --> 01:36:59.230]
And it goes on, bad stuff

[01:36:59.230 --> 01:37:02.510]
Bad stuff, but you know what? We won't be here to worry about it

[01:37:03.030 --> 01:37:03.670]
Hope not

[01:37:03.670 --> 01:37:08.930]
And as far as your children are grandchildren, obviously nobody cares about them so why bring up that stuff up at this point?

[01:37:09.050 --> 01:37:09.690]
Nobody cares about it

[01:37:09.690 --> 01:37:09.770]
Nobody cares about it

[01:37:09.770 --> 01:37:11.330]
Come up to a mountain range, and there you go

[01:37:11.330 --> 01:37:12.510]
There you go, there you go

[01:37:12.510 --> 01:37:16.650]
I told you I get to tell noon without all that crocking but now it's past noon

[01:37:16.650 --> 01:37:20.070]
So it's heavy, crocky time once you get past noon

[01:37:20.070 --> 01:37:22.990]
Speaking of a crocky and hockey, how about those oilers baby?

[01:37:23.190 --> 01:37:24.610]
Wow, what a game last night

[01:37:24.610 --> 01:37:29.250]
Who had nobody in South Florida, maybe a handful of us care and watch that game? That was something to behold

[01:37:29.250 --> 01:37:33.370]
What's better than staying cool and comfortable all summer long and all year long?

[01:37:33.490 --> 01:37:37.350]
How about getting an instant $200 cool catch ribbon on the world's smartest air conditioner?

[01:37:37.750 --> 01:37:39.730]

[01:37:39.730 --> 01:37:42.390]
You can get this fabric a system from Royce Air and Heat

[01:38:37.350 --> 01:38:39.970]
This is Neil Rogers

[01:38:39.970 --> 01:38:44.130]
What's solid? This is 5.69 AF

[01:38:46.610 --> 01:38:52.110]
He was trapped in ice, lived in a glass box and spent nine days underwater

[01:38:52.110 --> 01:38:57.590]
Now, Master Illusionist David Blaine faces his greatest challenge ever

[01:38:57.590 --> 01:39:00.190]
Come on man, I gotta get in there

[01:39:00.190 --> 01:39:10.330]
It's David Blaine on the can, trapped alone in the claustrophal bit confines of the downstairs half bath near the laundry room

[01:39:10.330 --> 01:39:14.590]
James, aren't really neat, check it in there man

[01:39:14.590 --> 01:39:23.630]
David Blaine on the can with only a glass of metamusin, a nearly empty roll of shaman and a five month old sports illustrated

[01:39:23.630 --> 01:39:29.570]
Hey, hey, come on dude, I so need to get in there

[01:39:29.570 --> 01:39:37.690]
Don't miss the exciting conclusion of David Blaine on the can when David finally emerges from his fortress of fecal matter

[01:39:37.690 --> 01:39:39.550]
Oh, here's man

[01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:45.590]
You know, come think of it, I don't have to go that bad, see you later

[01:39:45.590 --> 01:39:53.230]
David Blaine on the can, this time around he's making other people hold their breath

[01:39:53.230 --> 01:39:56.290]
A big h-gozen

[01:39:58.770 --> 01:39:59.150]
Oh!

[01:40:01.630 --> 01:40:07.550]
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

[01:40:07.550 --> 01:40:13.370]
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

[01:40:13.370 --> 01:40:17.310]
We're gonna have 1,043 votes on a poll, there's down here for a leveller, you wake up a little Suzy

[01:40:17.310 --> 01:40:19.410]
I'd say 1959, that's my guess

[01:40:19.410 --> 01:40:23.670]
I can't verify, cuz I only go up to 16th year on this, but that sounds about right

[01:40:24.170 --> 01:40:31.770]
Let's see, 1950 something, seven, not even close, sorry, can't be perfect, why not?

[01:40:32.390 --> 01:40:37.110]
Because it's me, oh, you'll love this story though, we just gotta squeeze this in, this half hour is an abortion, okay?

[01:40:37.170 --> 01:40:44.450]
We wanna apologize, it's ridiculous, I mean whoever heard of this kind of a formatics, but you know, the homestead is back to a 9 minute break this morning

[01:40:44.450 --> 01:40:48.670]
At least there's some spots, okay? Anybody want to buy a spot? Just a few cents

[01:40:49.670 --> 01:40:51.490]
30 cents, we'll give you a little holler

[01:40:51.890 --> 01:40:54.230]
Women's toes licked by man hiding under car

[01:40:56.830 --> 01:40:58.930]
See, I saved a good stuff for a nice half hour

[01:40:58.930 --> 01:41:01.190]
I know we didn't have time for a lot of stuff, but I'll save a bit

[01:41:01.190 --> 01:41:04.870]
It's almost as good as that portage on guy, but yeah, that's it, yeah, that's it, it was always even better

[01:41:04.870 --> 01:41:09.170]
Police in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and kinda places like Tulsa, this is where I still have a Oklahoma

[01:41:09.610 --> 01:41:13.830]
Police there are searching for a man who hid under a woman's car at a Walmart parking lot

[01:41:13.830 --> 01:41:17.850]
and then licked her toes as she loaded groceries into the vehicle

[01:41:19.130 --> 01:41:27.230]
The woman said she was at the Tulsa Walmart located near 81st Read and Lewis when she felt her toes being licked

[01:41:27.230 --> 01:41:32.650]
He was a dog, but when she looked down, she saw as a man lying under her wheel

[01:41:33.610 --> 01:41:38.130]
I felt something with my foot, the woman said, I looked at him and I said, what the hell are you doing?

[01:41:39.110 --> 01:41:41.910]
And that's exactly what I said, what the hell are you doing?

[01:41:41.910 --> 01:41:45.810]
Yeah, the culprit got up and ran away before police arrived to see

[01:41:45.810 --> 01:41:52.130]
The woman said the man who licked her toes is his spanic or Indian about 59 and weighs 150 pounds

[01:41:52.130 --> 01:41:54.410]
It was a way of black t-shirt and blue jeans

[01:41:55.030 --> 01:41:58.810]
The victim filed a police report and a witness also saw it happen

[01:42:00.330 --> 01:42:07.570]
Tulsa County assistant, D.A., said if the man has caught her face a misdemeanor charger of battery or outraging public decency

[01:42:08.510 --> 01:42:10.990]
Why should it be a log against looking somebody's toes?

[01:42:11.770 --> 01:42:17.870]
I guess maybe she didn't want her toes. That's right. Or maybe she enjoyed it. Or maybe she wanted to try the other foot.

[01:42:18.390 --> 01:42:23.470]
She should have said so. Could be. Don't forget to check out that QA event at the Huda's parking lot

[01:42:23.470 --> 01:42:26.990]
Pines and University right now. If you stop by right now and zip right over to the ballgame

[01:44:14.210 --> 01:44:16.470]

[01:45:34.010 --> 01:45:36.650]
Bin Laden on the move new sightings in Pakistan

[01:45:36.650 --> 01:45:40.290]
Don't you think that's worth just a mentioning sure read it off the monitor there I will

[01:45:40.290 --> 01:45:45.290]
Pakistani government sources till ABC news that they have credible reports that Osama Yamama

[01:45:45.290 --> 01:45:49.170]
And his entourage have moved down from high mountainous peaks along the Afghan border

[01:45:49.170 --> 01:45:54.330]
To a valley about 40 miles inside the Pakistan border the officials say the reports

[01:45:54.330 --> 01:45:55.350]
Put Bin Laden around

[01:45:56.810 --> 01:46:02.070]
Cohistans Kamarad Valley whatever it is official said the reports were validated by the release of Bin Laden's

[01:46:02.070 --> 01:46:05.970]
Audio tape yesterday which appears to have been recorded only two weeks earlier

[01:46:05.970 --> 01:46:08.770]
Well how do you know by an audio tape where the hell was recorded

[01:46:08.770 --> 01:46:12.270]
That's a quick turnaround suggests but some of the officials they've been

[01:46:12.270 --> 01:46:15.450]
Lodding as much closer to civilization even of I see previously

[01:46:15.950 --> 01:46:22.190]
Previous audio video tapes have taken as long as six weeks to become public got that got it

[01:46:22.190 --> 01:46:26.150]
So he's around Osama Yamama in fact wouldn't surprise me if we find him just before and maybe that will

[01:46:26.150 --> 01:46:31.130]
Need to be the big October surprise you think what do you like better a strawberry surprise or a October surprise

[01:46:31.130 --> 01:46:35.510]
Well, okay, here's the ideal on a pool all look at that thousand sixty votes

[01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:39.790]
We're worried like flirting with almost 1100 by 1230 even Josh can't believe that

[01:46:39.790 --> 01:46:45.150]
In fact, I think there's a bonus clause in its contract is new deal yeah

[01:46:45.150 --> 01:46:50.550]
That if we get that kind of a number that he gets like eighty-cousinion dollars from from George

[01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:57.630]
Beasley personal 90 90-cousinion yeah from a choice thousand sixty votes if Neil stops taking calls

[01:46:57.630 --> 01:47:03.590]
And we we take today two or three three wasn't it I think about three and pretty sure about three

[01:47:03.590 --> 01:47:07.730]
Yes, then it was only about two so we're five for five when that's impressive

[01:47:07.730 --> 01:47:10.670]
And those poor bastards are there what are they going to do now?

[01:47:10.850 --> 01:47:17.130]
Yeah, especially like about five or six of them which I don't have to even you know speak over like just spontaneously burst into flames

[01:47:17.130 --> 01:47:22.630]
I would only hope so when that be great a thousand sixty votes of Neil stop taking calls I'll listen the same

[01:47:22.630 --> 01:47:28.990]
487 almost 46% now how do you like that? I think they're starting to get the hang of it they're hanging it

[01:47:28.990 --> 01:47:36.230]
The collar suck 151 you put those two together you got over 60% I'll kill myself 90 and we want to see that

[01:47:36.230 --> 01:47:43.130]
I'll listen less 79 I hate this bull 78 I'll stop listening 45 4.2% are threatening they're rattling their spear

[01:47:43.130 --> 01:47:50.050]
I'll listen much less 42 I'll kiss the radio 35 listen more 29 and listen much more 24

[01:47:51.630 --> 01:47:59.890]
Can you we're making a big change today with or without the management in other words more we're moving ahead you know and if we have to leave a certain other people behind us in the wake too bad

[01:48:00.870 --> 01:48:09.590]
Right I'm not talking about the car I'm just talking about the mismanagement the idiots the bozos who are like they're like lost at sea man

[01:48:09.590 --> 01:48:16.510]
They're like a bunch of little kids on a rubber raft lost at sea 22 past noon don't tell me seven other break already

[01:48:16.510 --> 01:48:20.070]
Yeah, I think it is you think so I know something you're right

[01:48:27.010 --> 01:48:31.510]
All my friends love my new ride

[01:48:34.050 --> 01:48:38.930]
My mold is real cheap to drive

[01:48:38.930 --> 01:48:45.010]
And my mold is saving lots of money

[01:48:47.510 --> 01:48:52.510]
So I don't care if I look funny

[01:49:01.510 --> 01:49:05.630]
My mold is out pretty weekend

[01:49:08.510 --> 01:49:12.510]
My mold is making the black of geek yet

[01:49:14.770 --> 01:49:19.930]
My mold is too much gas now

[01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:26.830]
