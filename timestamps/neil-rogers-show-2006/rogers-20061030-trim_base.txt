[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.800]
Mike

[00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:01.500]

[00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:01.500]

[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:02.860]
Yell

[00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:04.680]
Aaargh

[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.040]
aahhhh

[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:05.340]
Taaayy

[00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.380]
ooooo

[00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:12.720]
a matter of pursuit

[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.400]
When I was livin

[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.720]
Yo�rå

[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.400]
He said hee

[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.100]
Was saved

[00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.100]
My soul

[00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:36.000]
But we made a D2 on the way to heaven.

[00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.640]
And into this bedroom we did take a stroll.

[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.880]
All right.

[00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.460]
He was standing in his underwear, told me to bend over and say a prayer.

[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.560]
Well, that was Robin Wemme and thank you, ma'am.

[00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.280]
I've got my listed by the preacher man, being high boy Rex Doree.

[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.820]
Rex Doree.

[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.200]
Rex Doree.

[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.900]
I felt like a sinner.

[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.200]
And I showed up to get communion.

[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.700]
But all my tongue that was in a wafer.

[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.780]
And it was a wilder dripping, I'm not sure.

[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.380]
Oh, my God.

[00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.780]
Well, he was standing in his underwear, told me to bend over and say a prayer.

[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.340]
Well, that was Robin Wemme and thank you, ma'am.

[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.900]
I've got my listed by the preacher man, being high boy Rex Doree.

[00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:41.380]
Rex Doree.

[00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.420]
Yeah, he was standing in his underwear, told me to bend over and say a prayer.

[00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.640]
Well, that was Robin Wemme and thank you, ma'am.

[00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.500]
I've got my listed by the preacher man, being high boy Rex Doree.

[00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.160]
Rex Doree.

[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.680]
Well, it damn near kill them.

[00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.260]
Anyway, your QM non-sports time is 102, Happy Monday 2.

[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.780]
It's October 30th.

[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.640]
But 30, ma'am.

[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.200]
And I say, you know what that means, don't you?

[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.580]
Nothing.

[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.180]
Nothing, too, things.

[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.260]
Nothing, too much.

[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.800]
It means tomorrow's Halloweeny and it means week from the Rosalars Sunday.

[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.000]
Do you think there's some connection there possibly?

[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.180]
US military deaths in Iraq in October reached 100 today, marking making this the deadly

[00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.660]
smuts of American troops in a year.

[00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.840]
The death toll mounted as militias in Al Qaeda states fierce battles in Baghdad, other parts of the country,

[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.660]
despite a four-month security crackdown on the Capitol and initial US troops on the ground.

[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.740]
It worked so well.

[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.640]
And meanwhile, a bomb explosion in the Saudi city area of the Iraqi Capitol of Baghdad is killed at least 30 people.

[00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.860]
And injured more than 60, I think it's up to 39, the death count so far.

[00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:46.700]
That's today, of course.

[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.300]
The blast occurred early this morning in the Moudafah Square on the edge of the densely populated predominantly Shia district.

[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.380]
It's the Shias and the Sunnis and the Kurds and the Kurds and the Sunnis and the Shias and the Geskis and the Orthodox and the Reform and the Al.

[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.460]
It is so freaking sad, man.

[00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.320]
Here's the poll result from, and the reason that there's so many votes on here, number one, and so few on to one today.

[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.760]
Today's poll we only got 5.50, seven of you get started.

[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.000]
We'll have a tough time getting to 1,000, I think. You want to know why?

[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.480]
Why? I forgot about it.

[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.600]
Oh, wow. Whatever.

[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.160]
No, I fact Eric the new poll like early in the day, and then I just forgot about it till about 9 o'clock last night.

[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.520]
And I thought I didn't switch the poll yet.

[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.440]
Oh no. And that's a good one today.

[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.160]
Thanks, Sean, who obviously is having white problems or something, or maybe just reconsidering his life.

[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.800]
It's on Sean's pile. Let poll. Don't blame me for it.

[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.780]
It doesn't make any difference anyway.

[00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.460]
We can do all the women-offensive polls we want because we need any women listening anyhow.

[00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.440]
That's right. We're not going to offend anybody. Not that we would mind defending anybody. Would we? No.

[00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.740]
No.

[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:56.780]
Anyway, 2372 votes on the poll from Friday. Most of the world's problems are caused by religious intolerance like the Shi'a is in the Sunnis and the Getskis and religious intolerance of 1045, but full 44%.

[00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.280]
Greed, 661. Agorance, 344, and how dumb do you have to be?

[00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:31.260]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[00:04:48.340 --> 00:05:01.240]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:24.000]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:53.540]
Everybody All of A Socied Are D Thousands

[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.340]
as well as nine record NBA championship titles and a number of years with Phil Jackson.

[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.340]
In those 20 years 16 with a solid Sauerbach head only one losing season

[00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.060]
while winning almost two thirds of his games.

[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.740]
He was inducted on the basketball Hall of Fame in 1969.

[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.880]
Eleven years later recognizes the greatest coach in NBA history

[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.300]
by the professional basketball writers and association of America.

[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.600]
That's, I got news for you Moe. You ain't no Johnny Moe, don't say that.

[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.380]
That same year 1980, he was inducted the second time at the Hall of Fame

[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.840]
in recognition of his contributions to the game.

[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.040]
And now he's dead.

[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.820]
I rode a red hour bus.

[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.620]
One of the really, I mean forget about it, I don't care about the NBA anyway.

[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.640]
He's just a colorful guy. You know what I mean?

[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.320]
What do you mean?

[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.060]
Why, I wonder why he's playing the first red.

[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.220]

[00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:35.160]
Is that where you're saying that?

[00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:35.860]
I make you a pardon?

[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.000]
I said because he started playing the first black players.

[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.800]
Is that where you're saying that?

[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.120]
Oh, you're bad.

[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:42.520]
You are really bad.

[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.760]
Everything he turns into a racial thing.

[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.820]
If you don't understand, we're getting really sour now

[00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.320]
because you probably forgot to turn a clock back on Saturday night.

[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:50.200]
I definitely did not.

[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:51.760]
I'll go for you.

[00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.420]
Here's the ace bowl boy.

[00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.940]
He is certainly just because the Tampa Bay buck suck

[00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.000]
and he lost again yesterday.

[00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.800]
They did score a touchdown though, I say.

[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:00.540]
That's pretty good.

[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.400]
What's the worst thing about women?

[00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.080]
500-82 votes.

[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.960]
Non-stop bitching, 120, bitching and moaning.

[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.080]
And ma-ma-ma-ma.

[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:09.580]
How low?

[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.800]
I voted for nagging myself.

[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.140]
Yeah, that's what I voted for.

[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.160]
Moves swings at 116.

[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.620]
It's that time of the month like every other day or every other minute.

[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.980]
It doesn't have to be that time of the month.

[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.200]
That's why I just said that sarcastically.

[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.140]
You weren't fewer.

[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.820]
That was all I was shining here.

[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:25.400]
How do you like that?

[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.360]
There's so much to ask about the freezing.

[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.560]
Never say what they mean, 72.

[00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.800]
Around realistic expectations, 72.

[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:34.900]
Nagging, 566.

[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:35.940]
That's going to be doing much better.

[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:36.400]
Nagging.

[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.800]
Why did you do this?

[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.400]
Why did you do that?

[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.120]
Why did you do this?

[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:42.220]
Nagging.

[00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.900]
There is nothing worse than a loud, shrill, nagging bitch.

[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:46.700]
I'm sorry.

[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.500]
I hate this 254, 9.2%.

[00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.740]
That certainly couldn't be all women.

[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:51.640]
We don't have that many women.

[00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.520]
When they get saggy and sloppy and believe me, they eventually will a 54.

[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.300]
No sense of humor, 18.

[00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.520]
And rush to commitment, 10.

[00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:59.400]
I don't even know what that means.

[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:00.380]
What does that mean?

[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.380]
Rush to commitment.

[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.420]
Oh, that they always want to get their hooks into you.

[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.100]
Just dating isn't good enough.

[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.980]
They need to get married and married and all their bills is quickly as possible.

[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.060]
I bet you Josh who's a Russian girlfriend wants to get married right away.

[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:12.960]
No, no, no.

[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:13.360]
Good.

[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:13.820]
Thank God.

[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:14.400]
Are you lucky?

[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.120]
You don't do it.

[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.040]
Don't ever do it.

[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.160]
Let George give you 85,000 reasons why you shouldn't do it.

[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:19.920]
He'll explain it to you.

[00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:20.400]
He wrote the library.

[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.340]
Our sales department is just, you know, I know the audience gets really fair to me, bitching

[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.740]
and moning like a woman about a sales department.

[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.680]
But I just can't deal with it, man.

[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.280]
They're just crazy people.

[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.940]
Anyway, speaking of that,

[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:37.640]
Beasley Broadcast Group said third quarter net income fell 37.1%.

[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:43.000]
The $2.4 million in revenue depth 3.1% to 31.1 million.

[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.420]
Beasley Broadcast Group.

[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:51.080]
Softness and Philadelphia and South Florida, which includes power 96 and QAM plus no

[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:55.100]
renational ad, the lower national ad sales cards of the clients, the Naples based company

[00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:59.700]
said in press release, let's send Miguel out there in the street corner by the sub shop,

[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.380]
the sub center, where they bucket to raise money for the beesleys.

[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.720]
Let's find another revenue stream.

[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.500]
That's all that reggaeton crap they're playing on power, too.

[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:12.740]
In Miami, third quarter results reflected the expense of WQM's baseball broadcast rights.

[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.320]
Oh, the Marlins are killing us.

[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.880]
God, your kill us, David Samson and Delilah.

[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.460]
And lower revenue at power 96, which we are seeking to address to operational and personnel

[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:26.760]
changes said George Beasley Chairman and CEO through operational and personnel changes.

[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.780]
Oh, no.

[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.640]
Lower revenue at power 96.

[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.440]
They're playing what?

[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:32.500]
Reggaeton.

[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:34.020]
That's that.

[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:34.940]
Reggaeton music.

[00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:35.460]
That.

[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:36.080]
That.

[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.620]
They just play it all day long.

[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.720]
Why do they do that?

[00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:39.640]
Tanner said so.

[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.320]
Oh, what a...

[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:41.900]
Hey, Tanner.

[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:42.480]
You're fair.

[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:46.540]
In this regard, we began to realize sales and operating improvements at our Miami sports

[00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:49.380]
station resulting from changes implemented earlier this year.

[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.020]
Let me read that sentence again.

[00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:56.600]
In this regard, we began to realize sales and operating improvements at our Miami sports

[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.980]
station resulting from changes implemented earlier this year.

[00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:03.060]
Beasley broadcast zones and operates 43 US radio stations.

[00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.940]
You see there even George Beasley from our Miami sports station.

[00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:07.960]
How do you like that?

[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:08.860]
What station is that?

[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:09.640]
I don't know.

[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.700]
Must be this one.

[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:11.680]
Sports radio.

[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.640]
QM Sports time is 11 past 10.

[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.520]
And Irene Solar has got an article in the hero of the yesterday.

[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.080]
Why is cracking pair a couple of sports junkies, and better read that about our new morning

[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.960]
show, the Canadian Bowl without more morning show?

[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.680]
600 votes even on the pool about women.

[00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.740]
How about if we put nothing like what?

[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:30.620]
Nothing.

[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:31.800]
Well, the worst thing about women.

[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.420]
Nothing.

[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.580]
Nothing I love them.

[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:34.680]
Or nothing they're great.

[00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:35.540]
Nothing they're great.

[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.060]
How's that?

[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:36.500]
Okay.

[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.780]
For all those guys who haven't been unfortunate enough like most of you have.

[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:44.400]
Maybe there's some very lucky guys out there who will only met sweet wonderful women who never

[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.460]
bid your nag or, you know, I've heard stories.

[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:48.260]
Yeah.

[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.060]
Like you do about, you know, big foot in the log class, log class monster.

[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:51.260]

[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.000]
Like this monster.

[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.680]
I've never really seen these creatures, but you hear stories about them.

[00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:57.520]
I'm sure that there might be some, maybe one of these.

[00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.800]
Maybe down to the show in the USA.

[00:10:59.400 --> 00:10:59.580]
Right.

[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:03.100]
Of course a lot of these Canadian women are also a daiki looking, but that's just those

[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.380]
haircuts and those outfits.

[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:06.860]
I don't know what you're laughing about.

[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:07.240]
It's true.

[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.620]
There's a lot of very daiki looking Canadian women.

[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.680]
And the British women, I think it's the British connection.

[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:12.340]
Injunction.

[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.340]
They're too cough.

[00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.600]
I think, or maybe the Berkha.

[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:16.840]
I told you that already.

[00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.640]
I've got, I don't know what you're laughing about.

[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.180]
There are many people in my building.

[00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.020]
There are many Muslim people who are just building.

[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:22.500]
Oh, you're saying that.

[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.520]
And some of them were the full, what they call a Gia Gia.

[00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:27.380]
I don't know what it is.

[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.600]
It would be a surreal experience, I think.

[00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:30.240]
Oh, there you go.

[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:30.740]
Yeah.

[00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:33.000]
And boy, they multiply like a rabbit.

[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:33.660]
So I'll tell you that.

[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:34.500]
It was scary.

[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.640]
10, 13, 5, 60, WQM, your sports station.

[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:41.600]
That's our sports time on your sports station with your sparr...oh, man.

[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:43.940]
This sale department, they put a lot of spots on here.

[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:44.560]
We'll say that.

[00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:45.480]
They're not too much else.

[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.080]
They certainly aren't...oh, they're crazy people.

[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.660]
Today is October 30th, which means you and Luke Bakro, Chevy Gudge,

[00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.220]
has two days to take advantage of this deal.

[00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.720]
If they're running out, they're raised to a thousand.

[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.380]
For the first time in their history, Luke Bakro, Chevy Gudge,

[00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:01.180]
where I've been by my great Corvettes and other cars for over 20 years now.

[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:03.640]
They want to sell a thousand cars in one month.

[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.820]
So if you wanted to help them do that, but more importantly,

[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.860]
take advantage of the fantastic deals they're winning for you right now,

[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.520]
then you got today and they're going to do it.

[00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.880]
They had the biggest selection to do and use cars including those hot new vets,

[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.240]
trucks, SUVs, and minivans anywhere in town.

[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.780]
They've also got great use cars starting at just $3,995.

[00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.540]
Every single lot of them backed by car facts here and there.

[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.980]
You won't find any lemons on a lot.

[00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:27.520]
Look, I said Luke Bakro has to sell a thousand cars in October

[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.980]
and they're staying open late till midnight every night to give them that number.

[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.260]
Today and tomorrow, that's it.

[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.760]
Forget the price, make them an offer, they'll be any deal.

[00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:37.640]
More money for your trade, zero percent, financing, rebates up to six grand,

[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.420]
whatever it takes they'll do it for you.

[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.960]
Only a Luke Bakro, Chevy Gudge, have a late two locations for you.

[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.260]
In Pompato Beach, a quarter mile west of I-95.

[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.880]
By the way, how'd that go yesterday, Josh?

[00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:46.720]
Great.

[00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:50.080]
And a coconut creek on four forty one.

[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.800]
Just out of the sawgrass expressway.

[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.100]
Don't forget they're staying open till midnight every night.

[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.100]
So get your fan out of some of Luke Bakro Chevrolet right now.

[00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:00.300]
Get the best deal on the Chevy.

[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.380]

Or check them on the wicked web at LukeBakro.bacch.rodt.

[00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:10.920]
The biggest name, the best talent to the business,

[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.960]
Neil Rogers, 4th radio 560-2AM.

[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:18.020]
That's talking about women.

[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.400]
Hey boy, what's that in your mouth?

[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:24.780]
You fairy.

[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.740]
In the middle of the night,

[00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.680]
she can't walk in a straight line.

[00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:38.800]
I can't take out of the way that she wants to see me.

[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.900]
If I look like we're late,

[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:52.240]
I'm a shankin' monkey to be in my life.

[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:55.240]
I let the people away,

[00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:00.740]
but I should've used my baby back away that she wanted to see me.

[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.600]
Yeah, that's what I mean.

[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.040]
And when I'm lonely,

[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.540]
I give you my new habit.

[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.360]
You're the little scared, you're the world.

[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.900]
I say the hell with both of them.

[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.720]
1019, here's a facts from our university,

[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.100]
died sending his facts again.

[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:45.640]
It couldn't be Kimba put it, maybe.

[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:47.320]
It's just for the poor,

[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.080]
their memory,

[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:48.880]
if you screw up the whole thing,

[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:48.880]

[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:48.880]

[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:48.880]

[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:48.880]

[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:48.880]

[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:49.800]
they'll never ever forget it,

[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.180]
and they'll make danger you don't either.

[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.700]
They'll never let you forget about it.

[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:54.060]
They're memory.

[00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:55.760]
Look at that.

[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:56.480]
Nothing, they're great.

[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.380]
Already got one vote,

[00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:58.520]
about a 632.

[00:14:58.620 --> 00:14:59.300]
Nothing long with them.

[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:00.040]
They're all great.

[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.220]
Anyway, here's Eileen Solar's column from yesterday's Miami Hero,

[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:03.960]
Wise Cracking,

[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:05.240]
Fear or Couple of Sports Characters.

[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.760]
If you missed this show on Friday,

[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:07.380]
by the way,

[00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.360]
I took a call on Friday.

[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.000]
For those who think I don't take any calls anymore,

[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:12.980]
I took one on Friday.

[00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:14.740]
And if you missed what they said,

[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:15.120]
it was,

[00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:16.500]
That was it.

[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:18.100]
Okay, anyway, it says,

[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.800]
Two hometown guys are making their good team

[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.740]
on a local morning radio sports talk show.

[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:23.440]
Well, thank God for a little press,

[00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:24.420]
a little PR, maybe,

[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.180]
because we sure needed.

[00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:27.020]
And of course, those beastly numbers,

[00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:28.360]
I shouldn't have thrown that stir out.

[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.100]
I shouldn't have shrifted.

[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.020]
Then it's a power 96 was in the dumper,

[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:33.600]
but they're going to can everybody's answer over there,

[00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:34.900]
because they've planned that garbage all day.

[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:35.740]
That's, what is it?

[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:36.620]
Rigatoning music?

[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:37.360]
Rigatoning music.

[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.160]
Rigatoning music.

[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:39.740]
Sure.

[00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:41.240]
Sounds entitled to me.

[00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:43.480]
Anyway, Eileen writes,

[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.520]
it's a guy thing from 7 to 10 a.m.

heading the Kinney and Bow morning show.

[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.580]
There's no question that they got the male audience out there,

[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:07.920]
don't they?

[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.620]
Or at least 910 to the percent of them.

[00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:28.320]
I didn't know that.

[00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:29.620]
Better sell the house.

[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:33.340]
The results so far as a marriage made in locker rooms.

[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:34.480]
What do they mean by that?

[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.460]
I get to make fun of Kenny when his shirts look sappy,

[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:38.680]
so that's every day Bo-Camp,

[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.820]
and I perquipped in a recent Wednesday morning station break.

[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.860]
Walker happened to be wearing a stylish,

[00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:44.760]
confident, bluish, blousey top

[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.580]
with yellow, green, and pinkish graphics.

[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.240]
Sounds very gay to me.

[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:49.620]
But I beat poet golf,

[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:50.860]
Walker's dad for the smirk.

[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:52.220]
They play golf.

[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:53.020]
Hmm.

[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.540]
Walker, who do a huge listening base

[00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.780]
at why would 100 of his outrageous war of the roses

[00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:00.160]
candid phone segment that triggered couples

[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.220]
in the Ony Air spats,

[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:03.060]
that he and Bo-Camp are our balanced team.

[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:04.880]
Walker married for eight years

[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.800]
to Dory Grogan, director of events and entertainment

[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.960]
for the Miami Dolphins,

[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.800]
and the father of Garrett 7 Brodie 5 and Newborn Lilly,

[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:12.800]
represents the every man fan perspective,

[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.340]
while Bo-Camp respects from a professional

[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:16.660]
athlete's point of view.

[00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:18.780]
The duo provides sports info,

[00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:20.560]
10 Minute Error with News and Commentary

[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.080]
about local and national sports teams.

[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:24.300]
It's all served up with post-game critiques,

[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:25.240]
a little bit of sex,

[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.320]
and heavy doses of humor.

[00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:27.740]
Call-ins are welcome.

[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.240]
Oh, baby.

[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.860]
Bo-Camp said the show was a throwback to the days

[00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:33.260]
when guys hung out in barbershops

[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.060]
to talk about sports women and gadgets.

[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:36.240]
Remember those days?

[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:36.940]
No.

[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.080]
Bo-Camp.

[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.520]
So how to call it a loopback row yesterday, Josh?

[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:43.380]
Awesome.

[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.360]
Got the 3-0-6s right there in the showroom?

[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:46.900]
Yeah.

[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.200]
I almost trust the test row.

[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:49.860]
Don't let him take one.

[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:50.740]
You'll ever see him again.

[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.580]
Bo-Camp are married since 1980 to Colleen

[00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.680]
and the father of Courtney 20 and Kimberly 14,

[00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:57.480]
joking a player talk that he and Walker

[00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.000]
signed out on the four-week contract

[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.460]
and opts to take a fifth pending negotiations.

[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.960]
We take the job of doing this show seriously,

[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.200]
but what makes us fun is we don't take ourselves

[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.240]
seriously, Bo-Camp,

[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.180]
or said, unlike the guy that precedes them,

[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:09.820]
Rock solid.

[00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.780]
Takes himself very, very seriously.

[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.040]
Rock solid.

[00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:15.020]
Actually, in the radio world,

[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:16.620]
shows can last as long as advertisers

[00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:17.760]
by time and list is two,

[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.540]
and it says, program director,

[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:20.900]
the anxious, unqualified,

[00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:22.980]
and on the way out the door, Josh Dero,

[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.040]
said the Kenny and Bo-Show will likely air

[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.560]
for a very long time.

[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:28.820]
We have fun, have some last-some-one,

[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.680]
something as serious we'll do that too, Dero said.

[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.280]
It's a little bit of everything.

[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:33.220]
All right.

[00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:35.500]
There's a little free publicity in the Harold.

[00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:38.160]
By Ilean Solar, thank you, Ilean, for sucking up.

[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:38.940]
That was very nice.

[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.960]
Clearance said we have a little punk.

[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.940]
Of course, he said that back in the days of the morning,

[00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:45.200]
what did they call that abortion?

[00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:47.660]
The zoo, new, magoo, whatever.

[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:49.160]
No, that's how they called it.

[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.560]
The morning abortion.

[00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:53.420]
With Ron Hershey.

[00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:54.740]
Oh my god.

[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:55.400]
Wow.

[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.120]
Oh, that was really beyond belief.

[00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:00.160]
Carolyn was on that show too, by the way.

[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:00.480]
Yeah.

[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.180]
649 votes on the pool.

[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:04.740]
What's the worst thing about women?

[00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:07.600]
This is one of, I want to make sure, Sean's pool.

[00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:09.140]
Sean is one of our regular pool providers.

[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.300]
Well, I don't want them to think that I'm picking on the ladies out there

[00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.360]
because I, what do I care?

[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:14.520]
I mean, mom's dead.

[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.540]
She was some kind of a nag though, I'll tell you.

[00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:18.400]
Oh, Brian.

[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:19.880]
No, what's wrong?

[00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:21.240]
Oh, god.

[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.740]
What's the worst thing about women?

[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:24.880]
I'm stopped bitching, 134.

[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.060]
Moot swings, 130.

[00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:27.660]
Nick and Nick knows to know,

[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.500]
we got a good battle going on between those two.

[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.660]
Unrealistic expectations, 80.

[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:33.540]
Like there's the first kiss in that right away.

[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:34.600]
Why are we going to get married?

[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:35.820]
When are you going to give me a ring?

[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.020]
Never say what they mean, 79.

[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:39.580]
Nagging, 75.

[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:40.120]
Yeah.

[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:40.900]
Yeah.

[00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:43.620]
I hate this pool, 69.2%.

[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:46.280]
When they get saggy and sloppy, 59.

[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.100]
When their boobs hang out of their knees.

[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:49.960]
No sense of humor, 19.

[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.080]
Rush to commitment, 10.

[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.620]
Nothing they're great for.

[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.020]
And their memory, none.

[00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:56.760]
I don't think that's going to get many votes.

[00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:57.360]
They're memory.

[00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:57.900]
No.

[00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.640]
I don't think that's probably, they never forget,

[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:01.700]
would be a better way of putting it.

[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.640]
But I don't want Eric to have to change that.

[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.940]
Because I'm sure he's got a lovely wife.

[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:08.380]
And he's got a nice little family there up in Orlando.

[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.700]
And, you know, he's not going to be participating in this.

[00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:12.760]
You're going to get cut off for a while.

[00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:15.880]
Al Qaeda's got plans for an October surprise.

[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:16.620]
How do you like that?

[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:17.620]
Oh, my god.

[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.260]
Is Osama going to weigh in on the midterm elections?

[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.680]
A senior counterterrorism official according to Newsweek.

[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.140]
Anonymous like other officials Newsweek spoke to.

[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:26.620]
Because the subject is sensitive.

[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.400]
Says that based on previous patterns,

[00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:32.860]
such as the release of a rare bin Laden taped just before the 2004 presidential vote,

[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.280]
a message before Election Day would not be surprising.

[00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.520]
Private expert and pervert Evan Coleman,

[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.460]
who consults for the feds on terror probes,

[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.320]
says Al Qaeda has likely released tapes at the rate of two or three a month.

[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.000]
This month they're short by one or two.

[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.360]
So he thinks a pre-election message is a very good likelihood.

[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:50.140]
Another US official says Intel experts believe Al Qaeda wants to be relevant

[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:51.720]
to the US political process.

[00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.400]
It's a week from tomorrow Election Day.

[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.560]
Don't early and often.

[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.420]
But a third counterterror official says we don't have any indication of Osama and company

[00:20:58.420 --> 00:20:59.160]
about the service.

[00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:02.980]
Spokesman for the FBI and Homeland Security Department said they were unaware of

[00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:05.820]
specific intel for shadowing an attack on US-Soroughly-Foot elections.

[00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:08.100]
Overseas this rate is more ominous.

[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:13.080]
Reports of a possible attack on Saudi oil installations which could raise US gas prices again.

[00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:14.160]
Well, that would be bad.

[00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:18.180]
The perpetrators would probably be Saudi Al Qaeda affiliates.

[00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.620]
Methods could include trucker boat bombs.

[00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:22.760]
US agencies aren't certain of threats credibility.

[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:23.480]
They own nothing.

[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:24.800]
They're just guessing.

[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.880]
Well, it could be this or maybe they will do it.

[00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:27.420]
Maybe they won't.

[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:28.260]
Who the hell knows, right?

[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.160]
They don't own nothing.

[00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:31.260]
That's why you're paying all those taxes to dollars.

[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.360]
Because they don't own nothing.

[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:33.760]
But we are killing a lot of people.

[00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:35.140]
That's the good news.

[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.620]
26 past 10 at 5, 60 WQA.

[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:40.680]
And that's our sports time here.

[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:42.260]
It's Eastern daylight time.

[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:42.760]
You're right.

[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:43.240]
This really.

[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:45.120]
Everything don't care.

[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:45.840]
You know what I mean?

[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.200]
Another was I set the clocks all back.

[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.680]
And I guess I got next hour sleep as a result.

[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.100]
And I don't really care one way or the other.

[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:54.020]
It makes no difference to me.

[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.480]
I just don't like the changing.

[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.320]
Isn't going to change my life.

[00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.060]
You know what I mean by that?

[00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.900]
When you get to be my age, you just go and to wake up in the morning.

[00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:01.280]
That's all.

[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:02.280]
When you get to be old.

[00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:05.180]
Some days my birthday, by the way, aren't you excited about that?

[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.040]
I'm sure the cards are pouring in.

[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.000]
There's a pile of them every day.

[00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:09.680]
It's fucking so.

[00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:12.460]
I gotta get a hand truck to move them out of the way.

[00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:13.840]
I feel piles right now.

[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.320]
Hey, speaking of birthdays, it's style of actresses.

[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:17.320]
30th birthday.

[00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:18.440]
About 30, man.

[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.900]
And to celebrate dilemmatres and Simmons are offering you the lowest price of the year

[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:24.460]
on the best selling Simmons beauty rest pillow top.

[00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:28.720]
You can sleep in real comfort like I've been doing for years on a great Simmons beauty rest.

[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:34.480]
You can choose from South Florida's biggest selection of Simmons beauty rest and get same day delivery from our good pizons at dilemmatres.

leave off the last S for savings and sales holes.

[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:28.380]
The biggest name, the best talent for the business, the unrot your house, 4th radio 560, UAM.

[00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:31.620]
Is that it now? That's it.

[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.100]
I want a double-second May show. That's it?

[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.840]
We'll get a second opinion if you want.

[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:37.220]
Sales people are ice holes.

[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.280]
This week on ABC.

[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:45.060]
Once we drive you on the dance floor, you were like a disco machine.

[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.900]
From the creators of Dancing with the Stars.

[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:52.300]
From my slumped chakja and the shakju, the gentle curve of your butt must glass.

[00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:54.220]
Sarah Evans and her husband, Starrin.

[00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:56.640]
I once could have naked dance for her.

[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.080]
Cheating, number stars.

[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.460]
Did you have any clue that he was cheating on you?

[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.920]
Now, if you don't, you're out there.

[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.000]
When I'm in high volumes, there you go.

[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:05.620]
Cheating, number stars.

[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:06.960]
My shrink couldn't make our appointment.

[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.040]
He found his third wife and that was his second wife.

[00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:12.100]
He got the president down in entire bottle and told me he got his pro-zac.

[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.500]
1032 SR, QAM Sports Time.

[00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:17.380]
That's our jockstrap, Likkin and Snippin' Time.

[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.380]
We have 687 votes on the pool.

[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.640]
Let's make it to 1000 to the evening, even though we had a late start.

[00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:22.300]
That's my bad.

[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:23.820]
I apologize profusely.

[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:24.260]
Don't I?

[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:24.520]
No.

[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:25.300]
Who cares?

[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.020]
Just as any of you know, we never got a facts.

[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:30.500]
We never got a call because we're not taking any calls, thank goodness.

[00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:33.260]
But I'm sure that would have been one of them from Dave the Cop saying,

[00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:34.880]
hey, Mike Cardinal's won the World Series.

[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.800]
Maybe Dave the Cop is gone these days.

[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:37.660]
He knows the facts number.

[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.380]
I'm sure he'll fast from wherever he's at.

[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:40.460]
I'm sure he's gone.

[00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:41.100]
He's gone.

[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.740]
They don't want to listen to some fat ol' fag on a radio.

[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.580]
Weedon news stories all day for four hours.

[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.620]
That's why a lot of the audiences are gone.

[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.600]
I wanted to call up every day and talk crap.

[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:52.440]
And that part of the audience are wanted to call up every day and talk crap.

[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.000]
We'd be delighted if they'd go away.

[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:55.400]
The only problem is, hey!

[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:55.960]
They're not.

[00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:57.500]
They're the last ones to believe.

[00:24:58.020 --> 00:24:58.380]
Chronic's.

[00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.980]
Maybe if you come up with something that they could drink like some chronic tonic

[00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:04.360]
would be good like curing that disease.

[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:04.920]
Nope.

[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:08.080]
Just days after the Cardinals won the top honor major league baseball,

[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.420]
the World Series, and a boring, very lowly wife series,

[00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:13.120]
I didn't watch ten minutes of the whole thing.

[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:14.160]
How much did you watch?

[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.120]
Josh, you watched the whole series?

[00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:17.860]
No, I watched it really a total of nine innings.

[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:18.580]
Tondress.

[00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:19.560]
Really boring.

[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:20.620]
Non-competitive.

[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:22.860]
Taggers just, they forgot to show up.

[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:23.820]
And they're fielding.

[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.260]
You can't complain about their fielding prowess because they didn't have any.

[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:27.480]
They kept throwing it away.

[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.560]
Anyway, their hometown jumped the first place on the list

[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.840]
that nobody wants to be in first place on the most dangerous cities in the USA.

[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:34.960]
Oh my god.

[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:35.580]
St. Louis.

[00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:43.000]
The Midwestern city has long been in the upper tiers of the annual ranking of the nation's safest and most dangerous cities compiled by Morgan Quinto Press.

[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:48.360]
Violent crime surge from nearly, and the surge nearly 20% there from 2004 to last year,

[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:52.000]
when the rate of such crimes rose much faster in the Midwest than the rest of the nation.

[00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:55.580]
It just said the way this city is, resident Sam Dawson said,

[00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.100]
on the news, he heard killing someone's been shot.

[00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:58.740]
A while.

[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.400]
The second most dangerous city was Detroit.

[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.220]
Oh, what a surprise that is followed by Flint, Michigan.

[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:06.780]
That's Michael Moore's hometown and Compton, California.

[00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:13.080]
The rankings released early today came as the city celebrates Friday's World Series victory at the New Boy Stadium.

[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:13.920]
The big arch.

[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:18.300]
St. Louis has been spending millions of dollars on urban renewal, even as the crime rate climbs.

[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:21.140]
St. Louis Mayor Francis stayed, the slay.

[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:22.100]
He just slays me.

[00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:23.480]
Didn't return calls to his office.

[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.440]
He can comment yesterday.

[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.420]
Among all higher cities, Cleveland was ranked the seventh most dangerous.

[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:30.140]
Youngest out at number nine and the Cincinnati 18.

[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.460]
Scott Morgan, president of Morgan Quinto Press,

[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.960]
a private research and publishing company specializing in state and city reference books.

[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.660]
Cities not surprised to see St. Louis on top of the list.

[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:42.420]
Since it's been among the most dangerous cities for years,

[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:46.900]
it's a dangerous, dangerous, nasty, hot, humid place.

[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:47.520]
It blows.

[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:51.060]
Morgan said the study looks at crime-oldy within St. Louis city limits,

[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.040]
with a population of about 30,000 to 330,000.

[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:56.440]
It doesn't take into account the suburbs in St. Louis County,

[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:58.840]
which has roughly 980,000 residents.

[00:26:59.040 --> 00:26:59.520]
The burbs.

[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.780]
The safest city in 2005 was brick, new Jersey.

[00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:05.600]
Never heard of it in my life.

[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:06.160]
Brick?

[00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:06.900]
Brick.

[00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:08.740]
As you can go through one out the window.

[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:12.160]
A population of about 78,000 followed by Amherst, New York.

[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.880]
You know what that's the suburb of, don't you?

[00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:15.240]
You don't want to live there.

[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:15.640]
Buffalo.

[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:16.120]
Oh.

[00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:17.420]
Nobody wants to live there.

[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:21.280]
And Mission D.A. Ho California, a city of just under 100,000 people, South of LA,

[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:24.060]
when they very young meet an agent who's 37 years old.

[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:25.700]
What's the median agent South Florida?

[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:26.220]
About 90.

[00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:30.140]
Cities are ranked based on more than just their crime rate, Morgan.

[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:33.820]
Said individual crime, such as rape or burglary, are measured separately compared to national

[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:35.540]
averages, and then compiled a gift city of ranking.

[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:38.240]
Crimes are weighted based on their danger to people.

[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:44.380]
The National FBI figures released in June show the murder rate in St. Louis jumped 16% from 2004 to 2005,

[00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:46.340]
compared with 4.8% nationally.

[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:47.280]
They're killing each other.

[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:48.240]
They're killing us.

[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:53.940]
While crime increased in all regions last year, the 5.7% rise in the 12th Midwestern states

[00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:56.840]
was at least three times higher than any other region, according to the FBI.

[00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:01.340]
Most dangerous 25, you want to, and then we've also got the safest 25.

[00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:03.660]
Guess what's number 25 on the safest list?

[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:05.540]
Port St. Lucy?

[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:06.160]
Right.

[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:08.060]
25th safest place.

[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:11.560]
Of course, who the hell would want to live there besides the idiot Greg from a Port St.

[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:11.840]
Lucy?

[00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:13.640]
The most dangerous 25.

[00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:14.480]
You're going to be surprised.

[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.900]
I don't see, uh, other than 25, which is Orlando.

[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.880]
I don't see any Florida cities on here.

[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:19.640]
Not one.

[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:20.120]
G.

[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:21.100]
Unsurried.

[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:22.660]
Most dangerous 25.

[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:25.120]
St. Louis number one, number 2 Detroit, then Flint, Michigan,

[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.000]
Compton, California.

[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.460]
Fifth is Candid New Jersey.

[00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:28.240]
You don't want to go there.

[00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:31.400]
Birmingham, Alabama, Cleveland, 7th, Oakland, California,

[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:34.060]
Youngstown, Ohio, and I'm Gary Indiana, 10th.

[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.860]
Oh, the schmutz, oh, the smoke, the filth.

[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.040]
Richmond, California, 11th.

[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:38.440]
I have no idea.

[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:39.000]
I never heard of it.

[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:39.340]
Did you?

[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:39.880]
No.

[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:41.060]
Richmond, California.

[00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:43.820]
Maybe it means Richmond, Virginia, but it says California.

[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:44.900]
I don't believe it.

[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:46.320]
On all Richmond, Virginia, it's on here.

[00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:46.560]
Sorry.

[00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:49.580]
Baltimore's 12th, Memphis, Tennessee, 13th.

[00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:52.180]
Trenton, New Jersey, a festering outdoor sewer,

[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.400]
an outdoor septic tank, a sum pump, is 14th.

[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:56.940]
Richmond, Virginia, is 15th.

[00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:00.000]
Kansas City, Missouri, is 16th, Atlanta, 17th.

[00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:02.420]
Since the 90-18 Washington, DC is 19th.

[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.300]
North Charleston, South Carolina, 20th.

[00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:07.120]
Reading PA, 21st, Newark, New Jersey, 22.

[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:08.280]
New Jersey, blows.

[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.660]
Little Rock, Arkansas, 23th, San Bernard,

[00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:12.200]
and the New California, 24th.

[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:16.280]
And the 25th most dangerous city in the USA is Orlando.

[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.460]
Get out of there, Eric White is still getting good.

[00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:21.800]
Safes 25, Brick, New Jersey.

[00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:24.780]
See, I mean, a lot of these are places nobody ever heard of.

[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.260]
Amherst, New York is second, that's Buffalo.

[00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:30.040]
Michigan, V.A.O. California, 3rd, Newton, Mass, 4th,

[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.380]
Troy, Michigan, 5th, Collin, New York, 6th.

[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:32.920]
I never heard of it.

[00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:35.920]

winnable even though his own generals in a vast majority of the American public know otherwise the Republican leadership of Congress

[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:45.780]
to try to ignore a serial sexual predator in their midst hoping the problem would go away it didn't for the past

[00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:50.500]
as years of the man for Republican leadership Congress was evasion of the facts and avoidance of reality now

[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:56.620]
12 years of corruption dalliance arrogance and outright malfeasance have come down on the GOP like a plague of locusts

[00:39:56.620 --> 00:40:03.300]
leaving behind a rotting putrid sludge that used to be a great nation and rotting putrid sludge I can almost smell it

[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:11.040]
must be walked across Lake Ontario a the first step to cleaning up the mess comes next week when we march into the voting booth and vote to throw out the garbage

[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:21.160]
that's only the first step if the polls and prognosticators prove right we can't waste time celebrating an elephant's death we have to make sure that the party of the jackass that takes its place doesn't return

[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:28.060]
wits old ways of doing business changes only the beginning and change must be the man true that guides us all in the coming years of the Democrats F up this

[00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:35.900]

765 oats on the pole yeah he just there was annoying and as far as the other one is concerned

[00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:24.940]
no comment the second dancer in the Duke rape case is said for the first time that the accuser told her to go ahead put marks on me after the alleged attack

[00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:31.180]
you following that okay dancer Kim Roberts made the new allegation which he hasn't shared with authorities in

[00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:37.040]
interview with Chris Cuomo that air today on Good Morning America Roberts allegation comes after Durham District Attorney Mike

[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:41.580]
Niphon's admission in court last week that he hasn't yet interviewed the accuser about the facts of that name

[00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:50.160]
as she drove the accuser from the March 2006 duke lacrosse party Roberts told ABC News of a woman was clearly impaired and talking crazy

[00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:56.740]
Roberts said she tried several different times to get the accuser out of her car the tripping that car from the house went from happy to crazy

[00:47:56.740 --> 00:48:02.740]
Roberts told Cuomo I tried all different ways to get through to her I tried to be funny and I she said then I tried to you know be

[00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:10.360]
stirr muther we're kind of circling around and as we're doing that my last attempt to get her out of the car I started to kind of you know push and prod her you know you know you know

[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:17.340]
you know Robert said she told the woman get out of my car get out of my car bitch I push on her leg I kind of push on her arm

[00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:24.040]
Roberts said and clear as a bell if the only thing I heard clear as a bell out of her was she said she pretty much had her head down but she said plain as

[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:31.520]
day go ahead put marks on me that's what I want go ahead Roberts said the comments chilled me to the bone and I decided right then

[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:36.020]
and there to go to the authorities Roberts wasn't aware of the time of any rape allegations which were first made by the

[00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:41.900]
accuser after police arrived and taking the woman to a crisis center in the interview Roberts appeared reluctant to talk about her new

[00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:47.780]
allegations it's something that I've been that's been weighing on my heart and I worry that maybe I won't be called a trial Roberts told

[00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:53.700]
Kloemot she reached for a tissue because of all so many of her so much of the accuser statements difference from mine I might not help the

[00:48:53.700 --> 00:49:00.780]
prosecution at all as a witness she said no kidding Roberts became visibly upset as she described the accusers comments for the first time at

[00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:06.280]
one point stopping the interview I don't even want to talk about this anymore she said why isn't so hard for you to reveal that Kloemot

[00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:13.180]
I said because I think it's going to make people rush to judgment it's going to make them stop listening and I don't like this at all it's going to make people not listen I'm sure

[00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:19.400]
probably not even going to play this it's going to make people not listen to any other part of the story it's going to make people so judgmental it's going to solidify

[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:23.040]
their opinion so much and not going to want to hear other aspects of the case which I think you're just an important

[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:31.280]
yadi yadi who cares you know who the hell gives a trap across team my ass you know Duke by the way don't I don't

[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:36.160]
think their hurricanes could have lost another game this weekend that would be a five and three record that they really lose the Georgia

[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:42.200]
Tech or that I'm maybe I dreamt that I saw that last part of the game no it was no dream when you look like they were going to

[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:47.240]
make that last minute come back and they decided with two and a half minutes left in the game rather than trying it on so I kicked

[00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:55.060]
a punted away and by that thing they stopped Georgia Tech on three straight girls running plays and they still had war

[00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:59.540]
like a minute and a half left in the game yeah and Georgia Tech that putter for them really did a hell of a job

[00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:05.780]
it kicked a whopping gigantic punt and here goes the hurricane kid back back back back and he right through his hands

[00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:11.600]
made drops the ball in Georgia Tech Flops on a game over Keynes lose again oh I can't believe that three losses in

[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:18.600]
one season they've only played eight games wow aren't we cursed thank God that offense had to buy yesterday because no

[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:22.700]
matter who they would have played they would have lost you know when you stop and think about the fact that they lost a Houston

[00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:27.860]
and what's up with that Oakland game who the hell did they be yesterday like the Steelers wasn't who did they be

[00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:35.040]
that's right no they beat the Steelers that's because a head job boy is out of there now he's got injured head problems he's got

[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:41.880]
hate problems been big old band I wonder if he's going to Uncle Bany think so seven hundred E one votes I think we'll get

[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:50.680]
all right that's not a shot of Curtis we just decided to have the mad dog back there's only one

[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:55.880]
why should there's lots of mad dogs but it's only one to manage mad dog two to four power hour with

[00:50:55.880 --> 00:51:01.740]
the hang in the mad dog rekindled again reunited four to five remember that song we united and that's not

[00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:05.060]
he doesn't heard horrible pieces and square man was the

[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:11.580]
United thanks all five to seven no relation to Napoleon solo pan through insider with

the other defendant market in Pembroke pine seven to seven thirty pan through insider

[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:24.820]
all those pan through losing a lot of three on that trip maybe I just had a dream that they did that

Curtis in the b seven thirty ten tonight and indicate ten o'clock because we got no ball game pan through is

[00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:34.980]

that game should I okay pan through some leaves on Thursday and of course I'd have to take off on Friday just a joke

[00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:47.000]
you think I'm coming all the way down there to go to a hockey game you a crazy person or what no I know better there you are well

[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:52.980]
yeah but I know better I may attempt by senator George mccocco with Alan a virgin to turn small sections of

[00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:58.040]
a book by rival Jim Webin away political issue Webin a speech yesterday stood by his work and criticized

[00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:03.860]
Alan for failing to address controversies that have played his own campaign in recent months senator mccocco with

[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:09.000]
the controversy began last week after the Alan campaign issued a press release describing Webin's book as

[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:14.040]
pornographic and inappropriate Web is stood by his work which has been law to buy conservatives including John

[00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:19.440]
McCain confetti gets a serious work of fiction based upon incidents he witnessed while serving in the Vietnam war

[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:26.300]
Alan did not participate in Vietnam of course like all these other chicken hawks all the chicken hawks all the time

[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:33.440]
so that's all they got to do is smear and smear that's their whole game plan that's the Carl Robeff and way man smear

[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:39.260]
seven eighty seven on the poll orders that the Alan misses what's your name this is green span

[00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:45.600]
face where democratic Jim Peterson is trying to unseat republican senator john Kyle Peterson currently trails

[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:52.080]
Kyle by only six points forty seven percent to forty one percent in the latest university of Arizona poll

[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:57.600]
Jim Peterson joins us now welcome okay good there is there's Jim Peterson you're going to lose Jim sorry too bad

[00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:04.460]
nearly one of every twenty five weapons the military bought for a rack security forces is missing

[00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:11.600]
a government audit said yesterday many others can't be repaired because parts of technical manuals are lacking parts or technical manuals

[00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:19.080]
or maybe parts of the manual a second report found significant challenges remain that put it risk the West's military goal is strengthening your rack security forces

[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:23.600]
by transferring all logistics operation to the defense ministry by the end of next year

[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:30.920]
a third report concerned the provincial reconstruction team program in which the West government experts help Iraq he's developed regional governmental institutions

[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:38.160]
the unstable security environment of Iraq touches every aspect of this program the report said how do you like that

[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:44.620]
the Pentagon can't account for fourteen thousand plus weapons almost four percent of these semi-automatic pistols

[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:50.900]
assault rifles machine guns rocket propelled grenade launchers other weapons have began to find your rack since the end of 2003

[00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:58.220]
according to a report from the office of the special instance in structure general for a rack reconstruction the missing weapons will not be tracked easily

[00:53:58.220 --> 00:54:05.080]
the defense department registered the serial numbers of only about ten thousand of the three hundred and seventy thousand weapons have provided less than three percent

[00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:12.420]
the Pentagon spent a hundred and thirty three million dollars on the weapons and the capacity of the Iraqi government to provide national security and public order is partly contingent on

[00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:24.280]
armoring the Iraqi security forces under the ministers of something in interior another another just box job just money just like opening up a faucet opening up the faucet in your bathtub

[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:31.620]

[01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:23.800]
newspaper, Juventud Rebell day.

[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:24.380]
Hoventud.

[01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:26.820]
Hoventud.

[01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:27.700]
Hoventud.

[01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:28.380]
Hoventud Rebell day.

[01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:29.080]
Means youth.

[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:29.820]
No.

[01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:33.880]
Dedicated its front page to the Cuban President, printing a blown-up picture of a

[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:37.880]
pensett Castro with this title, always fighting for something and fighting with optimism.

[01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:40.620]
He's never got like a kind of a smirk on his purse.

[01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:44.740]
The 80-year-old Cuban leader, who temporarily seated power to his brother Raul,

[01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:49.660]
gay, in July, following a testicle surgery, hadn't been seen since mid-September with photos

[01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:52.480]
of him receiving World Leaves of the Summer Nevada were released.

[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:56.020]
The latest photos, apparently, were taken during the filming of a video broadcast Saturday,

[01:01:56.620 --> 01:02:00.720]
in which Castro looking thin and tired, was shown walking slowly but steadily,

[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:03.500]
and I'm identified as a woman reading and loud voice from Saturday,

[01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:06.560]
the edition of Grand Ma, the Communist Party Daily newspaper.

[01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:10.960]
Somebody tell him that communism went out with the nickers and white box shoes.

[01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:15.820]
They declared me more of Bonne prematurely, he said, but it pleases me to send my

[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:18.120]
compatriots and friends this small video.

[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:21.000]
He said his recovery would be prolonged and not without risk,

[01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:23.460]
but I didn't think he was making good progress.

[01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:26.200]
I'm coming along just as planned, I feel a hole, he said.

[01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:28.040]
I'm not the least bit afraid of what'll occur.

[01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:30.980]
He called rumors of his death ridiculous and insulting,

[01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:32.680]
cleaning through the work of his enemies.

[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:36.280]
Let's see what they say now, he said, as he fumbled around.

[01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:42.500]
Castro dressed in a red-white and blue tracksuit, said he was trying to help those

[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:45.140]
thoroughly insurge the government as much as he could while he recovers.

[01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:48.540]
I participated in the most important decision with my comrades from leadership

[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:50.160]
of the Communist Party and the government, he said,

[01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:53.120]
I do everything possible to support my comrades and be useful.

[01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:56.900]
The rumors motivate me to work into fight, he said, well, what we do.

[01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:59.960]
The Cuban government has treated Castro as a man as a state secret

[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:01.160]
and rumors that he may have died.

[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:02.880]
I think he's got it.

[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.460]
Have intensified in recent weeks.

[01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:06.500]
He has made a public appearance since July 26th,

[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:08.540]
a few days before he underwent surgery.

[01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:11.480]
Maybe these pictures of the Castro are like a stunt Castro,

[01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:12.600]
like someone who's been lawdened.

[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:13.280]
That fact has been lawdened.

[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:13.900]
Have you ever seen that?

[01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:14.220]
Yeah.

[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:16.720]
This is the stunt Castro.

[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:21.660]
Remember we had the stunt, Sodom is there, and everyone had a double appearance.

[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:23.920]
Yeah, he had doubles and triples and quadruples.

[01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:27.140]
Just like those guys that we know them crystal burgers.

[01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:29.320]
Did you hear that bit at the end of the Kenny and Beaumont's show?

[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:30.160]
Yeah.

[01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:31.320]
No, sorry.

[01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:33.160]
This is excellent news for everyone.

[01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:36.240]
All Cubans and all Cubans, friends, vice-president Carlos Lughe said.

[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:39.300]
We are really having to see if it all is better than everything he's moving forward.

[01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:42.120]
Foreign Minister Felipe Perez, a roca, said.

[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:45.600]
He's not been lost just working on his recovery plan, right?

[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:46.840]
Very is asked.

[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:49.920]
The video shown Saturday, Kim a day after Castro's close friend and ally,

[01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:53.480]
Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, said the Cuban leader was walking and taking tips

[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:54.520]
at night into the countryside.

[01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:56.240]
It just got a wandering out the door.

[01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:59.660]
Like the chief and Jack Nicholson were going to do, McMurphy.

[01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:00.380]
Remember that?

[01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:01.740]
McMurphy.

[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:04.240]
MacRamack didn't make it.

[01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:06.600]
He had a little pillow problem.

[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:09.440]
Bolivian president, Ebo Moraleson, said it.

[01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:11.640]
The Castro returned to office in two or three weeks.

[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:15.640]
A top Cuban official previously sent a expected Castro back at the helm by December

[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:21.920]
when the country plans to hold a belated birthday celebration for a leader who turned 80 August 13th.

[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:24.800]
Why does America get a whole day birthday celebration for...

[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:26.260]
You're truly, huh?

[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:27.060]
It's all right.

[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:27.960]
I already got my gift.

[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:29.440]
Don't eat no cake, either.

[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:31.060]
What do you mean by that?

[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:33.460]
Make a meatloaf or something and stick a candle in it.

[01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:34.040]
That sounds good.

[01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:38.520]
In fact, on the infomercial for the GT Express, one of the things you make is a meatloaf sandwich.

[01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:39.980]
All right, but without the bread.

[01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:40.680]
Yeah.

[01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:41.940]
Or she takes two...

[01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:42.780]
Or she butters to...

[01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:43.700]
Is she his garlic butter?

[01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:44.440]
Sure.

[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:49.080]
And she butters the two slices of bread and puts them in like one upside down and one right side up.

[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:51.500]
And don't be using no bread crumbs when you make the meatloaf, either.

[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:52.900]
Oh, I hate that.

[01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:56.380]
If I'm eating meatloaf or meatballs, I don't want to like, no, hidden carbs in there.

[01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:56.940]
I don't want meatloaf.

[01:04:57.180 --> 01:04:58.200]
They always do that, I don't know.

[01:04:58.200 --> 01:04:58.680]
Yeah, I know that.

[01:04:58.780 --> 01:04:59.200]
Fill it up.

[01:04:59.360 --> 01:04:59.680]
I don't know.

[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:01.300]
Yeah, quit to fill in, okay?

[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:01.380]
Okay.

[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000]
Quit to fill in.

[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:06.300]
Wrap those to fill around your arms until you turn blue and then get lost.

[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:08.900]
828 votes on the poll.

[01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:11.740]
Pretty damn impressive, yes, me considering the late start we got.

[01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:17.300]
26th after 11, don't forget to mad dog is back today from a couple of days off.

[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:18.060]
Where the hell did he go?

[01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:19.760]
And who gave him permission and stuff like that?

[01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:21.400]
Is there anybody running a place now?

[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:23.540]
Is it like just stuff on automatic pilot?

[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:25.920]
I saw all of our management team.

[01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:27.140]
Including Chris Jones?

[01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:27.940]
No.

[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:31.280]
Including that salesman, Chris Jones, who comes in here ready?

[01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:32.460]
Lies through it.

[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:34.300]
Just lies with that southern draw.

[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:35.860]
You know, lii lii lii.

[01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:39.140]
That's okay though, he's loosed up that billing man.

[01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:40.920]
We got spots up the old earlobe.

[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:42.000]
We got spots all over the place.

[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:44.160]
We got spots on our nose, spots on our ass.

[01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:44.600]
Everywhere.

[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:45.480]
Just spotty.

[01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:46.340]
Like leopards.

[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:50.120]
Let me tell you right now today in the March of last days of October, which means you better

[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:53.440]
get into loopback road if you want to take advantage of their fantastic deals they're pumping

[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:55.280]
out during their race to a thousand.

[01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:59.300]
That's right, loopback road is after so a thousand cars this month and in order to do that,

[01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:02.700]
they're staying open until midnight every night to reach that one thousand number.

[01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:06.740]
Forget about price, make them an offering, they'll beat any deals so you're going to save a ton of cash.

[01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:11.860]
They give you lots more money for your trade, zero percent financing, rebates about the $6,000

[01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:15.200]
whatever it takes to make you a deal and get your ass in a great new vehicle.

[01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:17.860]
Only at loopback road, Chevrolet with two locations for you.

[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:23.940]
In popin' obiach a quarter mile west of I-95, look for that huge American flag and a coke on a creek on 441

[01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:25.840]
just out to the Saga Rast Expressway.

[01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:27.900]
How'd that thing at loopback road go yesterday, Josh?

[01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:33.300]
Well, don't forget to stay open till midnight every night so go to loopback road right now and get the best deal on new

[01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:37.720]
Chevy could ever dream of as you helped them race to a thousand for the first time in loopback road history.

[01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:44.100]
I've been buying my cars there for years and believe you me, it can't beat them when it comes to service and when it comes to selection and price as well.

[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:50.920]
Check them out on the wicked web at loopbackroad.com, B-A-C-H-R-O-D-T, loopbackroad.com.

[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:58.540]
The biggest names of best talents, the V-S-S-E-R-R-J-S, 420560-SU-A-N.

[01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:01.480]
I'm a horny fat bag.

[01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:04.340]
Alright.

[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:08.240]
I think there's new government.

[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:11.920]
But they always do time.

[01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:16.880]
What's the status, fifth things up?

[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:19.580]
Sure, right up in the mines.

[01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:20.580]
Yeah.

[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:23.840]
There's so many chaos over there.

[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:28.480]
Still be moments in your head.

[01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:31.380]
I don't wanna hear from Bush.

[01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:35.560]
That he is restoring peace.

[01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:39.160]
How will we know it to see that?

[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:42.660]
With them who do not proceed.

[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:47.880]
I just wanna know it to see that in the head.

[01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:51.480]
When you see more Mickey D's.

[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:53.840]
Riktaro.

[01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:04.460]
Once you saw that the fat fingers of Henry Kissinger were involved in this mess, then you knew we were in big trouble, didn't you?

[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:05.160]
Oh yeah.

[01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:06.700]
As if we needed to see that.

[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:08.620]
Tell us the piece in my head.

[01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:19.100]
A man is expected to appear in federal court today after he had to be handcuffed when authority say threatened to fly crew last night on a plane that took off in Boston and had to make an emergency landing in Orlando.

[01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:29.440]
Nobody was heard but the flight crew had a wrestle demand and bind his hands with plastic ties until the four-loader day of a bound plane could land according to jet-fouish spokesman Todd Burke.

[01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:34.180]
Agents from the FBI arrested the man on a flight interference charge when the plane landed in Orlando.

[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:36.500]
It was headed for a four-loader day. What does that tell you?

[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:41.480]
There isn't appear any discernible time to terrorism set up the FBI special agent Kevin Ferrington.

[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:46.020]
I wonder if he was akin to a Bob Ferrington or Rick Ferrington or that Gonsa Mishbaja.

[01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:52.660]
The man started yelling at the flight crew and other passengers and then it went from a verbal confrontation and became physical Ferrington said.

[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:55.820]
Remember I mentioned that last week, rambling willy and Bob Ferrington, remember that?

[01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:56.460]
You.

[01:08:56.940 --> 01:08:58.300]
And you said, oh yeah, I bet on that race.

[01:08:59.240 --> 01:08:59.840]
A third.

[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:03.180]
Authorities wouldn't release the man's name or hometown.

[01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:05.540]
He appears in federal district court in Orlando sometime today.

[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:10.400]
Ferrington would only say the man was in his forties and was, blah, blah, blah, blah, crazy in a bedbug.

[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:18.360]
Flight 457 was in Airbus A320 that took off from Logan International at 425 p.m. on Sunday, fully loaded with 156 passengers.

[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:24.820]
It was that ready to Orlando about 730 p.m. and continued down the four-loader day, finally touching down at 1120 p.m.

[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:31.500]
and left at 425 and it took him almost seven hours to get to Frickin' Four-loader day from Boston because of this jackass.

[01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:35.100]
Officials would not describe the confrontation between the man and the crew.

[01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:40.520]
Obviously, if we have to reach the reigning customers, it's pretty serious stuff, but it said, our flight attendant did by all the count.

[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:42.100]
An amazing job.

[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:46.880]
A crazy person ended for a four-loader day on how unusual.

[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:48.700]
Wonder for anybody we know.

[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:49.500]
We're coming home.

[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:50.200]
Hi!

[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:53.540]
I think there's any crazy people in South Florida who understand.

[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:54.060]
No.

[01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:56.980]
847 votes on that poll, man.

[01:09:57.140 --> 01:10:02.620]
It's kind of a disappointing number after those big, big fat ass numbers we threw in Air last week on Wednesday and Friday.

[01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:04.440]
I didn't remember that or 1,500 during the show.

[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:04.960]
No, what?

[01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:05.220]
You remember that?

[01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:05.780]
Yeah.

[01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:06.580]
God.

[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:11.720]
I bet you that Joe Bell was in there just dancing like Rumpel Stills can hop it up and on.

[01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:14.480]
Oh my God, look, you guys are kicking big smelly ass.

[01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:17.040]
Too bad we're not doing the same during most of our sports segments.

[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:17.580]
I'm sorry.

[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:19.180]
But aren't we at sports station?

[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:19.960]
Yeah, we are.

[01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:22.380]
Oh, there's that idiot Spencer from New York.

[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:25.940]
He's got about as much chance of winning a Spencer the Car Wash guy.

[01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:28.140]
And he's talking about people's looks.

[01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:29.860]
Oh, I think so, because we're in the quarter.

[01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:30.920]
What happened to him?

[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:31.640]
To report it.

[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:32.060]
Good.

[01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:35.160]
And I said nothing of the life looks like a prune on a bad day.

[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:37.360]
Looks like a couple of those on a bad day in the desert.

[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:39.220]
But somebody read over his face.

[01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:39.840]
Yeah.

[01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:40.860]
With a Mack truck.

[01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:41.580]
Anyway.

[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:42.960]
Well, what differences does it make?

[01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:44.540]
Okay, I mean, she's the ice princess.

[01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:46.880]
She's an astiol bitch and he ain't got no chance.

[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:48.640]
848 votes.

[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:53.380]
What's the worst thing about women like Hillary, for example, mood swings 171.

[01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:54.840]
When you least expect it.

[01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:55.680]
What's wrong with you?

[01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:56.040]
Yeah.

[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:57.020]
I don't know where.

[01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:00.040]
Non-stop bitching 155.

[01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:01.200]
Ngging 104.

[01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:05.120]
Oh, nagging is moving up nicely now that we both said we voted for that and rightfully so.

[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:07.180]
Think you put your glasses on.

[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:07.920]
Did you do this?

[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:08.620]
Did you do it?

[01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:09.520]
How come you did that?

[01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:10.420]
Why did you do that?

[01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:11.200]
Oh, brother.

[01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:12.540]
You're driving too fast.

[01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:14.540]
They never say what they mean.

[01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:15.300]
103.

[01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:17.600]
Unrealistic expectations 96.

[01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:20.860]
When they get saggy and sloppy 71.

[01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:22.120]
You don't want to get to be like about 30.

[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:23.780]
I hate this pool.

[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:24.260]
69.

[01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:25.260]
8.1%.

[01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:25.940]
Much too high.

[01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:27.000]
I'm pissed off about that.

[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:27.600]
Nothing.

[01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:28.300]
They're all great.

[01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:28.860]
27.

[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:29.720]
All women are great.

[01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:31.880]
Never met your mother or mine.

[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:32.520]
I get it.

[01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:33.980]
No sense of humor 23.

[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:35.240]
They never forget 19.

[01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:36.880]
And rush to commitment 10.

[01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:39.360]
After the first glance, they want to they want to ring.

[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:40.360]
They want to ring.

[01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:41.320]
They want to Cadillac.

[01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:43.780]
They want all your credit cards and all of these things.

[01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:44.980]
854.

[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:46.620]
We got the thousand like just relax.

[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:48.280]
Don't get all whipped up about it, Josh.

[01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:50.040]
Just because your team lost again yesterday.

[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:51.760]
Man, I shouldn't have said again.

[01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:54.220]
They actually you were starting to make a little bit of a run there last week.

[01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:55.500]
What about winning a game?

[01:11:56.260 --> 01:11:56.580]
What about winning a game?

[01:11:56.580 --> 01:11:58.520]
They pulled it right out of their ass right there at the end.

[01:11:58.580 --> 01:11:59.600]
Would I feel gold right now?

[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:01.380]
A shocking victory last week.

[01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:03.820]
All the big deal didn't mean Eagles lose to some girls.

[01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:04.340]
Team yesterday?

[01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:05.100]
Who they lose to?

[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:06.600]
They lost.

[01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:07.520]
I got their lost.

[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:08.240]
Jacksonville.

[01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:08.800]
That's right.

[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:10.300]
Oh my god.

[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:12.560]
Medi-aquity baby.

[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:13.280]
That's the name of the game.

[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:14.080]
That's the name of the NFL.

[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:15.660]
I'm not saying I don't enjoy my football.

[01:12:15.860 --> 01:12:17.380]
But boy, it is so mediocre.

[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:19.900]
And don't tell me the Keynes lost the Georgia Tech.

[01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:22.440]
The Randland wrecked from Georgia Tech on Saturday.

[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:24.300]
Because I wouldn't believe it.

[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:25.380]
All right, I did see the end of the game.

[01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:27.200]
I didn't know when I could fumble the punt.

[01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:29.940]
I was just, I was just squeezed myself.

[01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:30.720]
I was so excited.

[01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:31.500]
Oh yeah.

[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:33.000]
That was the end of the game, baby.

[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:34.520]
All over for the Keynes.

[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:35.040]
They suck.

[01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:36.660]
I think Donna Shalately,

[01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:39.280]
she ought to be taken out and tired and fed it for that loss, don't you?

[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:39.940]
Yes.

[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:44.620]
Because it's not a institution of learning of higher learning, lower learning,

[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:45.460]
intermediate learning.

[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:47.360]
It's a football university now.

[01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:47.960]
It's what's become.

[01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:49.280]
Thanks to Jimmy Johnson.

[01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:50.960]
And a bunch of other maniacs.

[01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:54.400]
I think the next day, maybe nearing your clothes if it often gets,

[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:58.260]
and out of the bear is pounded the crap out of very weak San Francisco yesterday,

[01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:00.320]
about 182 to 10 or something like that.

[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:01.460]
Right, 41, technically.

[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:01.960]
Yeah.

[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:05.800]
And that being the case, although the 49ers really suck, but nevertheless,

[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:07.960]
the dolphins, of course, suck real bad too.

[01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:11.000]
So what can only expect the game being right there in Chicago next week?

[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:12.760]
That the dolphins are going to get a wild,

[01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:15.400]
I'm thinking 63 to zip sounds like a reasonable score to me.

[01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:19.120]
Oh, and didn't one of Mad Dog's teammates die from the 72 dolphin team?

[01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:20.180]
I don't know.

[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:20.780]
Yeah.

[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:22.300]
I'm sure he'll talk about it.

[01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:24.320]
I don't, what's anybody ever heard of before?

[01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:25.660]
Some football player died.

[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:27.520]
And Red Hour Box died.

[01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:28.560]
Anybody remember Red?

[01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:29.140]
No.

[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:31.080]
I remember one time when I was a kid.

[01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:34.520]
My father took me to see a Rochester Royals Boston Celtic scheme.

[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:36.980]
Les Harrison, he was the bald coach of that.

[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:39.200]
I guess he had to be bald to be a coach, me and be a back in those days.

[01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:42.540]
He was the bald Royals coach, and Red Hour Box was the Celtic coach.

[01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:45.280]
And they got into a big argument with the referee about something.

[01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:47.920]
Man, they were screaming and yelling and carrying on.

[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:51.340]
The two of them, you can see the veins popping in their forehead.

[01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:51.960]
It was great.

[01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:53.400]
There's a lesson for you.

[01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:57.080]
Okay, don't be drinking a lot of booze and don't be smoking as big bad stogies every day,

[01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:00.340]
or you only live for like 89, like Weinstein Churchill and Red Hour Box.

[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:03.440]
I don't think I've ever seen Red Hour Box without a big stogie in his mouth.

[01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:04.500]
Do you, George?

[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:05.160]
What?

[01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:07.080]
Now, how about Weinstein Churchill?

[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:08.780]
Look up and see how he was when he croaked.

[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:09.620]
Do a little Google on that.

[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:10.120]
Please?

[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:10.500]
Okay.

[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:14.180]
I got a couple of anti-Walmart stories, and it's just for George.

[01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:16.180]
Oh, he's speaking of vans.

[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:20.320]
Oh, he's speaking to people that look really grotesque and are aging badly.

[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:20.940]
Woo!

[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:26.440]
She's the diva of divas, but Barbara Streisand apparently slipped in and out of a trendy Los

[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:31.040]
Los Olas Boulevard restaurant and for Lauderdale Saturday night with hardly anyone noticing.

[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:33.240]
Probably a couple of people are like poking each other in.

[01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:34.180]
Who's that old bag?

[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:37.360]
There would have been like a panic, you know, people running, screaming.

[01:14:38.300 --> 01:15:07.060]
Otea, I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I

You drag clean your carpets, they get out the dirt way down there deep in the fibers of

[01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:50.640]
your carpet, which makes your carpets smell eminy fresh, look and feel just like brand

[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:53.120]
new, stay cleaner longer and last longer too.

[01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:57.900]
And of course, your carpets are drying just a couple of hours so you really can clean

[01:16:57.900 --> 01:16:59.860]
today and entertain the night when you call dry concepts.

[01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:04.240]
Whether it's your expensive area rugs, your oriental rugs, your drapery furniture or

[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:08.340]
your carpeting, these are the people do a spectacular job for you every time, and now they've

[01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:11.700]
got a plan to make frequent cleaning easy, it's just a fraction of the cost of regular

[01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:12.360]
cleaning too.

[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:15.520]
You'll never have a dirty carpet again if you call dry concepts and they give you a

[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:19.820]
written guaranteed price up front before they start doing their unbeatable fabulous job.

[01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:29.220]
In Broward, call dry concepts at 9.54, 370, 778, that's 9.54, 370, 778, in Dayton Palm Beach

[01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:36.920]
Column Tool 3, 1-800-248-5071, and it's 1-800-248-5071, be sure and tell them that Hank

[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:39.920]
Guerrero sends you by when you call our good friends a dry concept.

[01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:51.180]
And they look like women.

[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:59.880]
1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4,

[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.780]
right off their heads.

[01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:34.520]
We're gonna fall around the clock tonight.

[01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:45.420]
We're gonna fall around the clock tonight.

[01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:51.980]
We're gonna fall around the clock tonight.

[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:53.720]
Oh, right.

[01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:56.700]
I think they picked up the moment.

[01:18:56.940 --> 01:18:57.720]
They picked up the moment.

[01:18:57.740 --> 01:18:57.740]

[01:18:57.740 --> 01:18:58.900]
They picked up the moment.

[01:18:58.900 --> 01:18:59.340]
They picked up the moment.

[01:18:59.340 --> 01:19:00.520]
They picked up the moment.

[01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:02.460]
They picked up the moment.

[01:19:02.460 --> 01:19:02.820]
They picked up the moment.

[01:19:02.820 --> 01:19:03.580]
They picked up the moment.

[01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:05.760]
They picked up the moment.

[01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:06.300]
They picked up the moment.

[01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:08.700]
They picked up the moment.

[01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:09.660]
They picked up the moment.

[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:11.380]
They picked up the moment.

[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:14.300]
They picked up the moment.

[01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:15.400]
They picked up the moment.

[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:18.200]
Panther inside of with Gully, that should have a big tune in audience from Doris'

[01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:20.160]
attendee market in Pemberpines at 7 to 7 30.

[01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:24.120]
And then Curtis at the B730 to 10 fall by the World Flaming Eddie Kaplan show.

[01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:25.220]
That's our line of no games.

[01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:26.760]
We got no Marlon games.

[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:27.820]
We got no Panthagin.

[01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:28.960]
Panthas in the Sharks tomorrow.

[01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:31.520]
Panthas in the Leafs at the Yannes Center on Thursday.

[01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:33.040]
Be a lot of Leaf fans here for that game.

[01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:34.340]
Trust me when I tell you.

[01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:36.800]
887 votes on the pool.

[01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:39.520]
I shared George's whipped up about doing some more hockey shows with your social

[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:40.420]
personal friend, Rimmer.

[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:41.720]
I'll call him right up there.

[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:44.660]
Yeah, call him right up there and tell him to spread some rumors about how my father died again.

[01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:49.940]
Giving Walmart Environmental Award is obscene rights Janet Street Reporter in the Seattle

[01:19:49.940 --> 01:19:51.200]
Post in Tel Avoncer.

[01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:53.640]
She writes for the British Independent, by the way.

[01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:54.220]
This is A.M.

[01:19:54.620 --> 01:19:55.260]
Syndicate a column.

[01:19:55.620 --> 01:19:58.080]
She writes for the Independent, a great newspaper in Britain, no less.

[01:19:58.380 --> 01:19:59.580]
It's a good thing they got a great newspaper.

[01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:04.320]
As the world gone mad, Janet wants to know in New York last week the supermarket chain Walmart

[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:08.080]
received an award for its contribution to the environment from the Hollywood filmmakers,

[01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:09.680]
Bob and Harvey Weinstein.

[01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:13.800]
It is true that a year ago Walmart reacted to criticism that focused on a range of

[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:17.480]
issues from their employees paying conditions to the devastating effect they have had on

[01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:21.480]
town centers across America by announcing a raft of environmentally themed initiatives.

[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:25.680]
Walmart announced they reduced energy use in their stores by 30%.

[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:26.560]
Not 30, man.

[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:31.240]
Over three years, use more fuel efficient trucks, cut down on packaging and recycle carrier bags.

[01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:35.980]
But hold on a minute, by building vast warehouses carrying a huge range of stock and

[01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:39.860]
slashing prices, which inevitably lead to smaller retail competitors going out of business,

[01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:44.800]
and by conquering over thousands of acres of countryside in order to provide car parking around their

[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:48.340]
air-conditioned mammoth warehouses, these measures seem like pitiful window dressing.

[01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:52.880]
Walmart's ruthless expansion has already played havoc with the planet in all sorts of ways.

[01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:57.600]
The render is just as changing the kind of light bulbs they plug in and encouraging us to take

[01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:00.100]
our own receptacles for our shopping, totally meaningless.

[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:04.380]
Walmart has not generally built up relationships with local growers and suppliers,

[01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:08.420]
reducing carbon emissions in the process because it's committed to bringing produce to its

[01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:10.460]
stores thousands of miles by road and air.

[01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:16.780]
It sells cheap goods and clothing made in third world countries where wages are low in environmental

[01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:18.940]
concerns, our secondary production cost.

[01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:24.060]
The Weinstein's, who are Democrats, would be ashamed of sucking up to a monolith that has

[01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:25.500]
closed ties to Republican Party.

[01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:29.760]
The real reason for their bizarre decision to present Walmart this award is because the retailer

[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:33.060]
shifts 40% of all the bees sold in the U.S.

[01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:35.880]
and the Weinstein's are at a producer series of films.

[01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:38.520]
I think that it shifts 40% as that's what we're looking for.

[01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:41.540]
Yeah, I think it should be shifts, but it's a shift.

[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:45.760]
And the Weinstein's had to produce a series of films for the family market, which would be sold only on DVD,

[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:49.840]
rather than shown at the box or office, so much worth of values as Janet.

[01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:54.180]
The idea of nominating any supermarket chain for an environmental award is ludicrous

[01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:58.160]
unless they're compelled to build all customer parking under or over their stores,

[01:21:58.660 --> 01:22:00.140]
thus limiting the size of their footprint.

[01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:02.720]
In other words, Walmart is like bigfoot.

[01:22:03.180 --> 01:22:07.440]
Until they can demonstrate that a sizeable proportion of the goods on sale come from within the defined regional

[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:12.820]
or quality, until they remove all packaging other than that which is biodegradable, then there's no case to answer.

[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:17.080]
Supermarkets hold considerable retailing power, which could be used to educate customers

[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:19.320]
in exercising more concern for their environment.

[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:26.400]
Surprisingly, it is consumers who have taken lead in demanding organic food and environmentally friendly products, not the retailers.

[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:31.640]
Stores could, for example, insist that all their cheap clothing was made using fair trade fabrics and in conditions

[01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:34.820]
where workers are properly paid and cared for, but they don't.

[01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:37.840]
The bottom line is the balance sheet and profit for their shareholders.

[01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:43.360]
A report published last week shows that resources have been used 25% faster than the planet can renew them,

[01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:47.720]
giving an environmental award to Walmart is an obscenity to which I would say,

[01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:49.580]
Absolutely correct, Janet.

[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:51.640]
How do you like that?

[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:52.240]
Yeah, then.

[01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:54.100]
Environmental Award My Ass.

[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:56.700]
And that's a big award, man, a big ass award.

[01:22:57.280 --> 01:22:58.980]
Well, we are almost to 900 in the pool.

[01:22:59.060 --> 01:23:00.980]
I think we got a thousand liquefied by one o'clock.

[01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:02.400]
And after that, it's all gravy.

[01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:04.000]
Hop on that gravy train, man.

[01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:09.500]
And Laura's Halloween, the only thing wrong with Halloween is that everybody eats all that candy and gets sick of their stomach.

[01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:10.300]
Yeah.

[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:15.340]
Now, if you want to be environmentally, if you want to be nice to the kids that come knocking on the door,

[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:17.180]
it's not a given a bunch of candy bars.

[01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:21.440]
Put something good in there, you know, like some little boxes of cereal with all the sugar in it.

[01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:22.380]
Okay.

[01:23:22.860 --> 01:23:25.500]
Well, no, I mean, so a lot of holidays have good food, okay?

[01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:27.180]
Halloween is not one of them.

[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:27.840]
No, I just can't.

[01:23:27.860 --> 01:23:29.800]
Like in Poland, we took the other day of Halloween is fun.

[01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:30.780]
And yeah, that's for kids.

[01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:32.120]
You know what, a yellow egg given?

[01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:32.780]
What?

[01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:34.420]
Coming up Turkish taffy.

[01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:35.580]
Oh, that'll pull their teeth out.

[01:23:35.940 --> 01:23:35.940]

[01:23:35.940 --> 01:23:36.040]
Yeah.

[01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:38.660]
Yeah, pull all the fillings out and then rot their teeth.

[01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:39.800]
Dennis, do you like your lot?

[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:40.920]
They'll come to your house and leave you a check.

[01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:43.280]
I got a Mary Jane here.

[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:45.040]
Well, oh, I love those.

[01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:46.520]
Man, I haven't had one of those in a year.

[01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:47.420]
Oh, I'll mail it to you.

[01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:48.140]
What are the color marbles?

[01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:49.220]
From just the vanilla wrappers.

[01:23:49.460 --> 01:23:49.980]
Oh, God.

[01:23:49.980 --> 01:23:51.260]
Where the hell do you find those?

[01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:52.100]
We don't have them, Mary Jane.

[01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:54.980]
You're not talking about Mary Jane Candy, bars man.

[01:23:55.540 --> 01:23:55.900]
Candy's.

[01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.060]
You're talking about Mary Jane that you're putting in your big fat bong there.

[01:23:59.180 --> 01:24:00.660]
No, no, this is not the same candy.

[01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:02.420]
Yeah, the only Mary Jane you know.

[01:24:02.820 --> 01:24:04.820]
Where the hell would you find them?

[01:24:04.860 --> 01:24:05.960]
Do they even make those anymore?

[01:24:06.340 --> 01:24:08.580]
Remember when we were talking about all that candy somebody brought to a mid?

[01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:10.040]
Like a rat pack.

[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:14.260]
Who brought it in?

[01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:15.420]
I don't know, somebody.

[01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:16.200]
It's made by Neko.

[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:18.040]
I'm reading the label over here.

[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:18.740]
Neko wafer is made.

[01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:18.960]
Yeah.

[01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:19.560]
It wasn't a long time.

[01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:20.500]
I do love Neko wafer.

[01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:23.480]
They're not really very good, but for some reason they're, you know, because they're pure

[01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:23.740]
sugar.

[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:27.540]
And so you take the role of Neko wafer and you start eating one or two and then you want,

[01:24:27.740 --> 01:24:29.020]
I can't stand the black ones.

[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:29.380]
I threw it away.

[01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:29.620]
Oh, oh.

[01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:29.760]
I threw it away.

[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:30.080]
What?

[01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:32.080]
I threw that candy thing away.

[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:32.520]
It was sticky.

[01:24:33.180 --> 01:24:33.700]
Well, I got the young plate.

[01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:33.820]
Well, I got the young plate.

[01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:35.160]
Yeah, like melting.

[01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:39.100]
Well, don't you remember I told you about that when we did that show and I think I saved that crap.

[01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:39.980]
And my pile here.

[01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:41.160]
I didn't save too much.

[01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:43.100]
It's a little bit of stuff that's eaten ancient.

[01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:44.580]
Almost as ancient as I am.

[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:46.320]
My fingers are sticky and not in a good way.

[01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:47.520]
Yeah, I asked that.

[01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:50.260]
I told you Josh was going to come in and give you a kiss.

[01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:52.160]
I didn't tell you to get that period away.

[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:54.420]
I don't, I think I threw that away.

[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:55.120]
I shamed candy.

[01:24:55.300 --> 01:24:56.320]
Because I can find it again.

[01:24:56.960 --> 01:25:00.880]
But I tried to say that last week that when we did that thing about the best candy of all

[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:05.920]
time and I found that website that where you can order all your favorite candy even if it's not

[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:06.440]
made anymore.

[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:07.120]
Okay.

[01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:11.440]
And we had sure, it wasn't that the chicken eggs somebody complained about the fact that they bought

[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:14.200]
some for somebody and it was spoiled.

[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:16.100]
It was older than the hills.

[01:25:16.340 --> 01:25:17.100]
It was older than the hills.

[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:17.840]

[01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:18.980]

[01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:19.160]
Yeah.

[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:23.400]
So the fact you got a Mary Jane there is probably a, I think they still make them.

[01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:24.080]
I don't know.

[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:25.960]
I don't, I don't need no.

[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:26.880]
I'm going to.

[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:31.860]
And what is that in the inside of those is like maple syrup or something?

[01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:32.560]
What's in the center?

[01:25:32.940 --> 01:25:33.120]
Sure.

[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:34.640]
Taste maple leaf.

[01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:36.500]
Oh seriously, maybe it's new.

[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:41.700]
Oh, Mary Jane, the comic.

[01:25:41.980 --> 01:25:43.860]
I don't want, oh geez, I hate this.

[01:25:47.380 --> 01:25:48.100]
Okay, I'm Google.

[01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:48.680]
Oh, here you go.

[01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:51.540]
Mary Jane's candy weight is a kid question mark.

[01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:54.700]
And there's pictures of them and they got the yellow wrap with little red thing around them.

[01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:55.420]
Yeah, just threw it away.

[01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:56.760]
Oh no.

[01:25:57.140 --> 01:25:59.260]
Little bite size peanut butter and molasses.

[01:25:59.460 --> 01:25:59.620]
Oh.

[01:25:59.620 --> 01:26:00.000]
That's what it says.

[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:02.160]
Even though your ass is Mr. molasses.

[01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:03.680]
Molasses is now.

[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:06.060]
A box of 160 is 999.

[01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:08.000]
Oh, this must be that website.

[01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:10.180]
Oldtimecontinue.com.

[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:10.780]
That's the one.

[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:11.440]
Yeah.

[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:14.480]
A box of 160 is 999.

[01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:16.820]
Case of 12 6 ounce bags is 1499.

[01:26:17.220 --> 01:26:17.960]
Oh, that's what I need.

[01:26:19.180 --> 01:26:22.820]
I need that like as they say and sweeten a locking coat.

[01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:24.900]
Like a hole in the head.

[01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:27.380]
Mary Jane's candy memories.

[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:28.540]
I remember when I was very young.

[01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:30.340]
It says we lived way out in the sticks in South Carolina.

[01:26:30.340 --> 01:26:32.400]
We were extremely poor on our birthdays.

[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:36.080]
We really received any, rarely received any gifts or cake.

[01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:40.060]
I do remember that there was a little country store we had to walk to.

[01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:42.180]
Little store was run by an elderly couple.

[01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:44.140]
I only remember calling them Mr. and Mrs. Gray.

[01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:49.340]
I remember we were so clear now that Mr. and Mrs. Gray always gave us kids a small penny bag full of Mary Jane's.

[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:51.000]
Oh, man.

[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:54.780]
By the time we shared the legacy of the time back.

[01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:56.380]
Yeah, time back of Mary Jane.

[01:26:56.660 --> 01:26:58.400]
That's what George wants for his birthday.

[01:26:58.860 --> 01:26:59.180]
Sure.

[01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:03.600]
So that's what I'm going to send you this year instead of a check I'm going to send you like a bag of Mary Jane's.

[01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:04.220]
That's good.

[01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:04.480]
Yeah.

[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:06.100]
How about a brick of hash?

[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:12.880]
Weinstein Church, by the way, for all you people smoking on big stodies out there, he only lived in 90.

[01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:13.260]
Yeah.

[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:15.400]
I found that out, but you know, you won on other things.

[01:27:15.860 --> 01:27:16.800]
I went under another rant.

[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:18.780]
Well, you started with a Mary Jane, you know how hard it.

[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:21.400]
Last week you were talking me on the ice cream which I resisted.

[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:22.300]
I kept my on.

[01:27:22.420 --> 01:27:22.620]
Oh.

[01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:25.400]
I couldn't stop that.

[01:27:25.420 --> 01:27:27.140]
I could find that for a Kit Kat ice cream.

[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:32.740]
I told you I got that it falls you and I got the ice cream shop in a casino there.

[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:34.560]
Oh, man, that was good.

[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:37.720]
And it's bizarre because I don't like Kit Kat candy bars at all.

[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:39.260]
Not in the least bit.

[01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:40.580]
Oh, fat, fooey.

[01:27:41.100 --> 01:27:42.780]
I'm about half a go over to the minion little later.

[01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:46.100]
I'm like after the show and find me a half a gallon of Kit Kat ice cream if they got it.

[01:27:46.420 --> 01:27:47.900]
And then maybe some Mary Jane's.

[01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:49.400]
Now you tell me they still sell those or what?

[01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:50.640]
I don't know.

[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:51.060]
No way.

[01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:52.000]
Get out of here.

[01:27:52.180 --> 01:27:53.680]
You're crazy for Kit Kat somewhere.

[01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:54.060]
They must.

[01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:54.900]
What?

[01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:56.180]
They must still sell them.

[01:27:56.180 --> 01:27:58.380]
Well, during the break I'm going to research it.

[01:27:58.600 --> 01:27:58.600]

[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:03.280]
No, after the show I'm going to have some of that lope curve pasta.

[01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:04.160]
There you go.

[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:06.660]
You know the people who came to sell that might be promoted.

[01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:09.600]
Get yourself back on track.

[01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:10.500]
Right.

[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:13.140]
915 votes on the pool, man.

[01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:14.940]
What's the worst thing about women and men?

[01:28:15.020 --> 01:28:15.940]
It's not an easy choice.

[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:19.200]
Some of these names of the best salad services.

[01:28:19.780 --> 01:28:19.800]
Yeah.

[01:28:20.420 --> 01:28:23.500]
The most radio 560 issue a.m.

[01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:29.740]
Mrs. Mark Morgan is the 12 to 1 hour on Q.A.M.

[01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:34.480]
The father of a 1 year old Malaria and boy reportedly adopted by Madonna.

[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:37.300]
So he's happy his son is escaping poverty.

[01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:41.580]
Local officials say the pop star pants are adopted for child while she is in the country.

[01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:44.740]
Visiting a project that she funds for a bill for us.

[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:49.220]
The relatives say the star and her husband die, which he are to adopt David Bander.

[01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:51.520]
Maybe they had been confusion with the name Donna.

[01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:54.960]
Donna is colloquial for rich women and Madonna is star.

[01:28:55.060 --> 01:28:56.520]
I still have things I want to do.

[01:28:56.660 --> 01:28:57.400]
Things I want to say.

[01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:00.200]
You know, people want to hear it, then that's great.

[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:09.160]
When two mother we the other night, the material girl, she wants a kid who's from another nation.

[01:29:11.500 --> 01:29:20.960]
Her and I felt that it was right since Brad and Angelina when they gave her the menstruation.

[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:22.920]
I've always thought my kids are around the world.

[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:45.040]
It doesn't pay that one of the world's richest superstars is adopted a 13 month old boy.

[01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:52.600]
I'm a kid I'm free.

[01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:57.100]
I'm a child before I die.

[01:29:57.780 --> 01:29:58.420]
I'm a Catholic.

[01:29:58.760 --> 01:29:59.780]
Her husband is 26.

[01:29:59.940 --> 01:30:02.120]
We are closely on the lulls and it's getting tight.

[01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:03.140]
She can do it.

[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:06.560]
She's a second Catholic in the village.

[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:10.940]
You hate to like boys and wish that the plane would crash with you on it.

[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:12.100]
Anyway, it's level three.

[01:30:12.220 --> 01:30:13.400]
That's our QA on sports time.

[01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:16.460]
You know who I really love and you're the one that inspired me to look this up?

[01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:17.280]
I love Neko.

[01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:18.100]
Okay.

[01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:19.500]
I never knew it till this moment.

[01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:23.360]
It says Neko is a New England confectionary company.

[01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:24.480]
That's what that stands for.

[01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:25.660]
How do I know that?

[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:25.840]

[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:26.180]
Did not.

[01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:32.640]
They should start back to the summer of 1847 if the oldest multi-line candy company in the USA.

[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:44.800]
Neko, new corporate world headquarters in Reverse Mass, manufacturers, timeless candy classics, such as Neko Wafers, Sweet Hearts, Conversation Hearts, Mary Jane, Clark Bars,

[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:46.300]
Oh, my favorite.

[01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:50.460]
Mighty Maltz, Havelin, Thin Mints, and Candy House Candy Buttons.

[01:30:51.020 --> 01:30:52.140]
Clark Bars are my favorite.

[01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:55.140]
Oh, what I wouldn't give her like a box full of Clark Bars.

[01:30:55.580 --> 01:30:56.500]
And you can get them, of course.

[01:30:56.800 --> 01:30:57.460]
Yeah, but don't know.

[01:30:57.700 --> 01:30:58.240]
No, I will not.

[01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:02.400]
Anyway, this oldtimecandy.com, which is a start of the whole candy thing.

[01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:04.980]
And as I recall, the audience didn't like that thing at all.

[01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:05.880]
I thought it was fun.

[01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:07.160]
That's why they didn't like it.

[01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:11.360]
But oldtimecandy.com did have a kosher candy list.

[01:31:12.660 --> 01:31:16.120]
Oh, click on the candy name for pictures, packet size, and pricing.

[01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:16.940]
Where they're trying to pedal.

[01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:19.760]
What I don't understand is, where the hell did they get it from?

[01:31:20.260 --> 01:31:26.040]
In other words, if there's a candy on this list that hasn't been manufactured since the Jesus was a baby, where the hell did they get it from?

[01:31:26.140 --> 01:31:28.340]
And how come it isn't like older, you know what I mean?

[01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:30.220]
I'll spoil and rotten like they're Mary Jane used.

[01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:31.020]
You threw it away?

[01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:32.820]
I threw it away. It was sticky on the outside.

[01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:35.320]
It's been here for like a month or six.

[01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:38.340]
Yeah, if it's sticky on the outside, man, run like hell on the candy, too.

[01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:41.000]
These are all kosher candies.

[01:31:41.420 --> 01:31:43.760]
So maybe you could have these on Paisa, huh?

[01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:46.320]
Would I make them paste it if he can't even know what that was?

[01:31:46.580 --> 01:31:47.540]
It's so terrible.

[01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:48.420]
All this crap.

[01:31:48.900 --> 01:31:49.380]
I'm not.

[01:31:49.540 --> 01:31:50.220]
A hundred grand.

[01:31:50.620 --> 01:31:59.080]
And then that tells you the kosher status like Circle U, KSA Parv, the markings on the packets that make, so you know for danger that it's, yeah.

[01:31:59.340 --> 01:32:00.260]
What does that use stand for?

[01:32:00.740 --> 01:32:02.320]
It stands for Shut Up and Keep Eating.

[01:32:03.300 --> 01:32:04.960]
Three musketeers, Fifth Avenue.

[01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:06.540]
Oh, I haven't had one of those in a long time.

[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:07.800]
Amazama.

[01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:09.740]
Anus squares or is that Anus?

[01:32:10.940 --> 01:32:11.620]
Baby Ruth.

[01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:14.800]
I mean, that song was a baby Ruth by George Hamilton IV.

[01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:15.940]
No, no, no, no, no.

[01:32:15.940 --> 01:32:22.320]
On ABC Paramount Records, I remember like I was just yesterday and then I always thought that this George Hamilton who can't act his wet of a paper's sect.

[01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:24.780]
I thought that was George Hamilton IV, but it's not.

[01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:27.240]
You know, George Hamilton, he was in Godfather III.

[01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:27.960]
Yeah, yeah.

[01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:29.000]
He played the concert yet.

[01:32:29.260 --> 01:32:30.660]
He won't have that song, by the way.

[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:31.320]
What's that?

[01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:32.840]
Baby Ruth's song you're talking about.

[01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:33.960]
I don't know.

[01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:37.360]
Anyway, banana split, big bruiser job breaker.

[01:32:37.620 --> 01:32:39.120]
Oh, God, I love those job breakers.

[01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:40.920]
The ones that were real real hot.

[01:32:41.220 --> 01:32:44.340]
Oh, made it by the time you got to the middle of like burn your tongue out.

[01:32:44.460 --> 01:32:45.880]
It's a bit of honey.

[01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:46.780]
That's one of my favorites.

[01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:49.540]
Black Lich, that's made by Nestle, but honey.

[01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:51.340]
That's a surprise because Nestle is generally sucks.

[01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:54.480]
Black liquorish dollars, I don't know what the hell it is.

[01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:56.740]
Bob Sweets drives Minster's Butterfinger.

[01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:58.040]
Oh, Nestle makes those.

[01:32:58.040 --> 01:32:58.740]
I love Nestle.

[01:32:59.020 --> 01:32:59.780]
Don't you love Butterfinger?

[01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:00.760]
I love Butterfinger.

[01:33:00.860 --> 01:33:01.620]
I had some of them yesterday.

[01:33:01.620 --> 01:33:02.800]
Get out of here.

[01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:03.220]
I had two.

[01:33:03.660 --> 01:33:05.880]
Chico's little chocolate babies.

[01:33:06.140 --> 01:33:07.480]
Oh, we've seen too many of those.

[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:08.200]
Chuckles.

[01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:09.280]
I have chuckles.

[01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:11.700]
Those squares, you know, those are awful.

[01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:12.360]
Chunky.

[01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:13.060]
That's hard.

[01:33:13.460 --> 01:33:14.260]
Double bubble gum.

[01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:14.800]
Good and plenty.

[01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:15.960]
Good and plenty of this crap.

[01:33:16.380 --> 01:33:17.080]
I love these places.

[01:33:17.480 --> 01:33:18.020]
Good and plenty of this.

[01:33:18.020 --> 01:33:18.080]
Good and plenty of this.

[01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:19.000]
Get the movie theater, man.

[01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:20.380]
Yeah, I'll take your portion.

[01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:20.980]
I'll take your portion.

[01:33:20.980 --> 01:33:21.280]
I'll take your portion.

[01:33:21.380 --> 01:33:21.380]

[01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:23.160]
Hershey's, I don't like liquorish.

[01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:23.780]
Hershey's kisses.

[01:33:24.180 --> 01:33:25.180]
Hershey's milk chocolate bar.

[01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:26.280]
Honeycomb peanuts.

[01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:28.640]
It's a boy-bulk hard candy.

[01:33:29.180 --> 01:33:29.900]
JuJu-bees.

[01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:30.680]
Or you start with that.

[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:31.600]
JuJu-bees.

[01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:32.720]
Well, that figure's to be quotient.

[01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:34.600]
JuJu-fr-juji fruits.

[01:33:35.340 --> 01:33:35.720]
Kit-cat.

[01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:36.460]
Oh, man.

[01:33:36.580 --> 01:33:37.260]
How about a Schmidt-cat?

[01:33:37.820 --> 01:33:39.240]
Laffy-tapy liquorish babies.

[01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:41.640]
This list goes on for M&M peanut.

[01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:42.540]

[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:43.440]
M&M plain milk does.

[01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:44.260]

[01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:45.300]
Nestlees.

[01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:46.320]
Oh, god.

[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:48.980]
What kind of a fool goes out and buys a Nestlees chocolate bar?

[01:33:49.300 --> 01:33:50.580]
How many years since you bought one of those?

[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:51.400]
I hope a long time.

[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:52.700]
Yeah, a long time.

[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:53.320]
Oh.

[01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:55.620]
I mean, Hershey bars another right home about it.

[01:33:55.660 --> 01:33:57.300]
Except the new ones with the almonds in the toffee in them.

[01:33:58.360 --> 01:33:59.160]
But Nestlees.

[01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:00.180]
I like butterfinger.

[01:34:00.380 --> 01:34:00.980]
Someone to have a bar.

[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:02.160]
Non-parels.

[01:34:02.380 --> 01:34:03.480]
What do you mean you're going to have a bar?

[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:04.620]
Someone to have a candy bar.

[01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:05.780]
It's going to be a butterfinger, yeah.

[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:06.200]
Oh.

[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:07.080]
Don't drop it.

[01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:08.280]
Don't be a little break.

[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:09.260]
Oh, Henry.

[01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:10.020]

Red vines original red bars and red toys.

[01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:18.020]
Reese's peanut butter cup.

[01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:20.180]
I hate Reese's Pieces.

[01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:20.860]
Rollo.

[01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:22.940]
Well, you know what's talked about Rollo ice cream.

[01:34:23.460 --> 01:34:23.680]
Okay.

[01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:25.040]
Big chunks of Rollo ice cream.

[01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:27.280]
Reese's Pieces have no chocolate in it.

[01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:27.960]
That I can find.

[01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:28.400]
Really?

[01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:30.360]
It's just peanut butter coated with peanut butter.

[01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:31.220]
I hate peanut butter.

[01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:32.560]
Root beer barberals.

[01:34:32.660 --> 01:34:33.080]
I like those.

And floats.

[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:43.420]
I don't know squirrels.

[01:34:43.460 --> 01:34:44.400]
I don't know.

[01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:45.580]
Stick candy.

[01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:46.340]

You know.

Walnettos.

[01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:48.540]
What's it going to call it?

[01:34:48.780 --> 01:34:49.840]
Wopper's Agnut and Zero.

[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:51.200]

Old time candy duck.

[01:34:54.060 --> 01:34:55.540]
Why did you give me stir it on this again?

[01:34:56.360 --> 01:34:56.960]
Because I'm saying.

[01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:00.040]
And what was that Roger's candy that somebody ordered online?

[01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:01.200]
Remember I told you how good it was?

[01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:01.840]
Yeah.

[01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:02.720]
Remember that?

[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:03.620]
What the hell was that?

[01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:05.020]
I'm going to Google it in the next break.

[01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:05.640]
But you know what?

[01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:06.660]
You have to put it in a peanut brittle.

[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:08.160]
No, it was what?

[01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:09.160]
It was peanut brittle.

[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:09.760]
No, it's not.

[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:10.300]
Okay.

[01:35:10.860 --> 01:35:12.460]
No, it was like chocolate on the outside.

[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:13.180]
It's crunchy.

[01:35:13.420 --> 01:35:14.060]
I'm obsessed with it.

[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:15.120]
Like toffee on the inside.

[01:35:16.020 --> 01:35:16.340]
Mm-hmm.

[01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:18.100]
I'm just addicted to that.

[01:35:18.300 --> 01:35:19.860]
I have nothing with sugar when I'm addicted to.

[01:35:20.620 --> 01:35:22.720]
I don't care what anybody says, man.

[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:24.140]
There is nothing more addictive.

[01:35:24.140 --> 01:35:26.140]
I don't care whether it's heroin, whether it's.

[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:27.720]
How do you name it?

[01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:28.120]
Right.

[01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:30.100]
There's nothing on a planet that is more addicted.

[01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:32.360]
Just take a look at what's his name's arm there?

[01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:33.620]
What's his name's arm?

[01:42:32.060 --> 01:42:37.620]
unchecked global warming world devastated world economy on the scale of the world wars and the great depression made your British reports

[01:42:37.620 --> 01:42:42.620]

[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:44.860]
Fascist they're telling us coming stuff

[01:42:45.460 --> 01:42:50.060]
Introducing the before British Prime Minister Tony Blair said unabated climate change would cost the world between

[01:42:50.060 --> 01:42:54.640]
5 and 20% of global gross domestic product each year speaking of gross man

[01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:58.880]
You got that candy on my mind now bad big time. I don't want no candy

[01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:02.120]
Okay, don't do it. We're not gonna get some Mary James

[01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:05.320]
Blair called for bold and decisive action

[01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:12.260]
Nicholas during a senior government economist said that acting not a country in house gas emissions would cost about 1% of global GDP each year

[01:43:12.260 --> 01:43:16.880]
The evidence shows that ignoring climate change will eventually damage economic growth since during

[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:21.740]
700 page report the first major effort to quantify the economic cost of climate change

[01:43:21.740 --> 01:43:27.260]
Maybe I could get that entire report and have a Josh put it on our website. It's only 700 pages on speaker that by the way

[01:43:27.260 --> 01:43:32.080]
We're a little bit short on stories lately. So Josh is decided. I'm gonna give out that website. Yeah

[01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:34.000]
The new story email address

[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:40.160]
Some critics claim the prime minister is using Canada's position within the treaty the Kyoto Treaty to undermine it

[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:45.840]
Acting on behalf of Washington which has little influence in Kyoto negotiations because the US of course is not part of the protocol

[01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:52.840]
Under the 1997 Kyoto Accord 35 industrial countries committed to reducing emissions by an average 5% below 1990 levels by

[01:43:52.840 --> 01:44:00.600]
2012 we should live so long but Britain is one of only a handful of industrialized countries whose greenhouse gas emissions are full in last one and a half decades

[01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:06.420]
You when said today the you when said Germany's emissions dropped 17% between 1990 and 2004

[01:44:06.420 --> 01:44:12.380]
Britain's by 14% and France is by almost 1% overall there was a 2.4% rise

[01:44:12.380 --> 01:44:18.840]
Animations by 41 industrialized countries from 2000 to 2004 that was playing most of the informer Soviet blood countries

[01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:26.280]
Whose emissions declined in the economic downturn of the 1990s then increased by 4.1% during the most recent four-year period

[01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:32.900]
The British government is considering a new green tax on cheaper airline flights fuel and high-mission vehicles as well

[01:44:32.900 --> 01:44:35.300]
How do you like that a new green tax?

[01:44:36.460 --> 01:44:37.320]
Mm-hmm

[01:44:38.140 --> 01:44:42.180]
You just you've missed my mind up with that candy stuff you brought it up

[01:44:42.180 --> 01:44:48.640]
How I did all right you started with a Mary Jane crap you started it and I noticed it where did it come from?

[01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:54.040]
I don't know from before from whenever that package came in well that's like a year ago

[01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:57.600]
And I'm using it's oozing molasses. Oh, that sounds good

[01:44:57.600 --> 01:45:03.800]
I open that thing I check it fact Mary Jane is very much like it's a long the same line

[01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:08.680]
I so it's no surprise that the same maker makes them I guess a bit of honey. Oh right very similar

[01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:12.300]
It's not the same maker bit of honey is made by Nestle except for that molasses

[01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:15.660]
Molasses sticky. Yeah good stuff

[01:45:15.660 --> 01:45:21.900]
Can you imagine getting your blood sugar up to about 50 easy? I got a crap they'd like a pig all week and they get 975

[01:45:21.900 --> 01:45:24.460]
Oh, Santa Paul I'm down to about one 93 and change

[01:45:24.460 --> 01:45:29.080]
I think it was one 93.4 something like that who votes the point and I may not be the greatest number ever

[01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:34.760]
But that's not bad after a recent picking up including your ice cream induced picking up

[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:40.240]
God once you started with that of course that was that was thanks to our friends at the Ferrell's ice cream in the Jackson Jackson

[01:45:40.900 --> 01:45:44.800]
In Daniel in Jackson Michigan. Mm-hmm. I was good. It was well worth it

[01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:48.760]
I guess it had to price now do you guys take any home like a couple of tubs or not? Oh, yeah

[01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:52.960]
No, I took a couple of tubs home in the hot dogs that that we were talking about the weeners from home

[01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:57.560]
I haven't eaten yet, but I took a bunch of them you went investigate Israel's uranium weapons

[01:45:57.560 --> 01:46:04.040]
The UN environmental program is investigating allegations first published in the British independent that Israel may have used

[01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:06.820]
uranium-based weapons during the summer's war in lesbian on

[01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:10.560]
20 UN experts working with Lebanese environmentalists have spent two weeks

[01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:15.220]
Decacing various samples and planning to report their findings in December. We should all live so long

[01:46:15.220 --> 01:46:16.560]
Vuktras Alahar

[01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:20.380]
Harb a UNF's Middle East director total Lebanese radio interview over the weekend

[01:46:20.380 --> 01:46:23.080]
If uranium was used we will find out and we will announce it

[01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:25.360]
We can't confirm anything now, but we'll wait for the results

[01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:31.160]
Yesterday Israel issued its most explicit denial yet. Mayor Avatar Libovitz a

[01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:36.600]
Spokesman spoke to one for the Israel Defense Forces said we deny using any weapons containing uranium

[01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:42.300]
One official suggested that if the environmentalists had indeed found presence of uranium they would have looked for a different explanation

[01:46:42.300 --> 01:46:46.020]
Chris Bosby the Scientific Secretary of the European Committee on Radiation Race

[01:46:46.020 --> 01:46:53.860]
Ra-Risk based in Brussels reported last week that two serial samples thrown up by Israeli bombs in the South Lebanese villages of Kiam and Optri theory

[01:46:53.860 --> 01:46:58.900]
centers of fierce fighting between Israel and his blah showed elevated radiations signatures

[01:46:58.900 --> 01:47:04.640]
Dr. Bosby warned that particles from the explosions were long lived in the environment and could be inhaled in the lungs

[01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:11.340]
causing significant health effects on civilians just like those cluster bomblets that have significant health if I like death

[01:47:12.100 --> 01:47:17.340]
Yeah, oops side effects include death the Harwa laboratory. What if that's named after Ernie Harwell?

[01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:19.280]
The Harwa laboratory from aspect of

[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:24.880]
Traumatry in Oxfordshire confirmed the concentration of uranium isotopes in the samples

[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:28.800]
But the European experts were puzzled by what the weapons is your might have been using and why

[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:32.540]
Chris Bellamy I wonder if he's kin to a Ralph Bellamy or Brian Bellamy

[01:47:32.540 --> 01:47:35.460]
Chris Bellamy a professor military science and

[01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:39.100]
Doctor of Crannfield University said initial test present and enigma

[01:47:39.100 --> 01:47:44.900]
But in this misspeculation that is it was using a dirty bomb or a micro-year nuclear weapon

[01:47:44.900 --> 01:47:46.840]
What I like that

[01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:50.400]
The rest of those is ready to pick out that stuff you know where they got it from don't you

[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:55.540]
Uh, I just mentioned that in passing because like I said, it's one of Bush Bush might use

[01:47:56.100 --> 01:48:01.440]
Biggest hobbies is killing people these good religions man. They're killing us with kindness. They're killing anybody they can with kindness

[01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:03.480]
977 on a poll

[01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:08.240]

[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:13.420]
Kimmy and Bo and no mo morning show and thank god they didn't write anything about ratings

[01:48:13.420 --> 01:48:18.460]
It's much too premature you know you're such a hard-ass picking on those guys because they had a point nine in September

[01:48:18.460 --> 01:48:24.200]
Their first full month on a year doing that show. I mean you got to realize that the entire audience from before the hopper

[01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:26.740]
They followed him in the afternoon both of those two share numbers

[01:48:27.260 --> 01:48:29.700]
So that we're like starting from scratch we're scratching it

[01:48:29.700 --> 01:48:33.440]
So if you give these guys a couple months and then they're like come January we'll bring in a real show

[01:48:33.980 --> 01:48:40.480]

And daily drop 2.8% but the Herald is up tourist baby the circulation is drop it like a rock a rock

[01:53:02.860 --> 01:53:08.620]
995 on the poll there's that anxious phony Joe Scarborough that pasty floored a congressman around MSNBC

[01:53:08.620 --> 01:53:13.940]
What is again in play? Yeah play this you idiot you quizzling you fairy

[01:53:14.700 --> 01:53:19.080]
I like this article like Dr. Jerry lower how much lower can you go

[01:53:20.440 --> 01:53:26.460]
I'm the smirking champion says how many years for Bush and Cheney Paul Craig Roberts has recently asked a provocative question

[01:53:27.020 --> 01:53:32.620]
One if Enron skilling gets 24 years in prison. Why see that's a footnote thing

[01:53:32.620 --> 01:53:36.720]
If Enron skilling gets 24 years in prison. How many should Bush and Cheney get?

[01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:39.260]
There's no way to answer this question of course except in the hypothetical

[01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:44.180]
So let's firstly get factual memory can get hypothetical in the interest of America a medic in justice

[01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:48.780]
Factually the Bush administration is the worst thing that's happened in America in the past two centuries

[01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:54.840]
Indulangically it's 180 degrees off course and pursuing an incomprehensible agenda in the interest of the corporate demeaning of America

[01:53:54.840 --> 01:53:58.100]
In the interest of a global US economic hegemony hegemony

[01:53:58.100 --> 01:54:01.860]
Why is it that all of a sudden since about two months ago? I can't say that word anymore. You forgot?

[01:54:01.860 --> 01:54:05.460]
Talk to Andy. I didn't forget about the candy though about those Mary James

[01:54:05.460 --> 01:54:11.980]
Mm that molasses just dripping down your chin the Bush administration justifies itself with partnering to Old Testament

[01:54:11.980 --> 01:54:17.080]
Roman values and world views which in has no intention of allowing to influence its neo-fascist agenda

[01:54:17.700 --> 01:54:21.300]
The extent to which the Bush administration will go to maintain its agenda is not so hypothetical

[01:54:21.300 --> 01:54:24.020]
Given the past half decade of Bush and E policies

[01:54:24.020 --> 01:54:27.700]
We can rest assured that the Bush administration will go far beyond anything

[01:54:27.700 --> 01:54:31.660]
resembling reasoning common sense of which the Bush administration has no defyable grasp

[01:54:31.660 --> 01:54:35.120]
These are the sorry facts of the matter about which we may now get hypothetical

[01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:38.780]
The American deaths of 9-11 have been avenged by several orders of magnitude

[01:54:38.780 --> 01:54:44.500]
Afghanistan is in a shambles or some have been lawd remains footloose and the Taliban are making a resurgence

[01:54:44.500 --> 01:54:50.160]
Palestine and Lebanon are in a shambles erect never having possessed weapons of mass destruction or having supported been lawd

[01:54:50.160 --> 01:54:53.120]
Is advancing away from democracy toward a Shiite partition

[01:54:53.740 --> 01:54:57.480]
To be sure it's not possible to democratize any nation under the values of Judaism

[01:54:57.700 --> 01:55:02.020]
Old Testament Romanism or Islamism there simply is no historical present for such occurrence

[01:55:02.020 --> 01:55:08.240]
Hypothetically then we can ask what happens when the Bush administration fails in its efforts to establish a democracy in Iraq

[01:55:08.980 --> 01:55:14.240]
Hypothetically we can ask what happens when the Bush administration becomes further entangled in the middle of Iraqi civil wars

[01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:18.180]
What happens when the Bush administration takes preemptive action on Iranian nuclear facilities

[01:55:18.180 --> 01:55:24.320]
What happens in the case of Middle East nuclear meltdown involving all three branches of Arab-Abrahamic religion?

[01:55:25.380 --> 01:55:29.340]
Abrahamic regardless of how the end of times for religion and capitalism come to be played out

[01:55:29.340 --> 01:55:34.380]
The end of times will be planned under the result of blind self-righteousness on the part of the Abrahamic religions

[01:55:34.820 --> 01:55:36.340]
To which we say oh

[01:55:36.940 --> 01:55:43.740]
The end result will almost certainly involve criminal charges and impeachment proceedings against the Bush administration's main players for crimes against the people

[01:55:43.740 --> 01:55:50.020]
We're now in a position to consider hypothetical punishments given the enormity of the crimes the most appropriate punishment in Bush's born again

[01:55:50.020 --> 01:55:53.000]
Old Testament Romanize a course will be like in prism and or death

[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:56.200]
We must remember however that we are Americans. We know that death never solved anything

[01:55:56.200 --> 01:55:58.300]
We know that incarceration has solved them solved anything

[01:55:58.300 --> 01:56:02.400]
Even so we can embrace the common sense that says some people just need to be locked up

[01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:05.660]
Then they can be on lockup on MSNBC which here is 80 times a night

[01:56:05.660 --> 01:56:09.580]
Because this administration was appointed to office as opposed to being elected into office

[01:56:09.580 --> 01:56:12.560]
The people have no obligation for further physical support of these criminals

[01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:15.660]
Somewhere in a brushy region of Texas or in lower New Orleans

[01:56:15.660 --> 01:56:22.800]
The American people may build George's W Bush the George's W Bush penal colony for intellectually bankrupt and morally corrupt un-American politicians

[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:28.560]
It will provide a separate gated and guarded community with small one bedroom rental apartments for its occupants spouses

[01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:34.720]
Welcome all inmates would be required to work for a living to pay for their own food lodging and utilities just like everybody else in America

[01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:39.980]
They would do so at the current federal minimum wage no other sources of income allowed for the members of the Bush administration

[01:56:39.980 --> 01:56:44.380]
It's the most appropriate to have poverty and immobility imposed upon them for their durations

[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:48.820]
This would constitute a punishment based on compassion instead of vengeance

[01:56:48.820 --> 01:56:56.360]
Americans are not a mean and vindictive people once we've seen the wandering human rights and operationally meaningful concepts of fairness equality and justice for all people in America

[01:56:56.360 --> 01:57:01.420]
No one will need to be punished beyond the level experienced by the poorest Americans under religious capitalism

[01:57:01.420 --> 01:57:07.380]
Abraham is on the other hand of Bush coming to realize the end of times straight underneath his own administration's policies and programs

[01:57:07.380 --> 01:57:14.320]
Perhaps he will still save the American people a lot of trouble by simply offing himself with Sodom Hussein's pistols for their ultimate touch of irony

[01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:15.340]
How do you like that?

[01:57:15.340 --> 01:57:19.340]
Mm-hmm Abraham Abrahamic religions don't you love that?

[01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:23.100]
I got one in the backyard what a pistol and Abrahamic no

[01:57:23.860 --> 01:57:26.400]
Swinging it. Oh all the time. Oh

[01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:27.340]
Always knew it was a swinger

[01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:32.120]
1240 20 to 1 that's our QAM sports time. How about them?

[01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:37.040]
Hurricanes baby. How come that's off and oh didn't lose no game yesterday because they didn't play one

[01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:39.600]
I guarantee if they'd have played a game yesterday they'd have lost it

[01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:42.620]
They'd have played a pick up game with a bunch of Sandlock kids. They've lost it

[01:57:42.620 --> 01:57:45.520]
They're a losing kind of team because they got a losing kind of coach next day

[01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:51.720]
But an immediate hates him like poison man. You don't come to town open up a big mouth and like you know turn on everybody in the media

[01:57:51.720 --> 01:57:54.980]
Am I right? Huh when you're in a position like next saven

[01:57:54.980 --> 01:58:00.100]
I think the saven area is just about over and I think after the bear is cremated that often the next week in Chicago

[01:58:00.100 --> 01:58:03.900]
I think that'll be the end whether he gets canned or not that reads to be seen

[01:58:03.900 --> 01:58:08.760]
But I'm just talking about symbolically that will be then be like putting a stake through Dracula's heart remember that?

[01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:10.840]
Oh, yeah, remember professor about Helsing

[01:58:10.840 --> 01:58:11.220]
but

[01:58:11.820 --> 01:58:17.540]
A thousand and twelve votes in that pool man. We are really off to the races trust me. There's that obnoxious patent cannon

[01:58:17.540 --> 01:58:22.540]
Breaking photo of that little girl in Arlington and her father who was a virginian

[01:58:22.540 --> 01:58:24.420]
I wonder if Raleigh is gonna write him in again

[01:58:24.420 --> 01:58:27.800]
What about those old Jews and Palm Beach? You think you're gonna try to vote for Buchanan?

[01:58:27.900 --> 01:58:29.600]
We're getting 2008 that'll be great

Back in the church

Absolutely

[02:00:05.720 --> 02:00:08.200]
Cheers

[02:00:14.020 --> 02:00:14.820]
Woo

[02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:42.740]
Ha ha, here's my new gun, pony, my pony.

[02:00:43.600 --> 02:00:44.460]
You're fairie.

[02:00:45.900 --> 02:00:50.300]
I haven't seen much fun with you, fun trolley.

[02:00:51.440 --> 02:00:57.460]
Ha ha, here's a jelly-crackers can't be far behind now.

[02:00:57.460 --> 02:00:59.380]
Yeah.

[02:01:48.800 --> 02:01:51.940]
I'm looking on the two J's menu.

[02:01:51.940 --> 02:01:53.600]
I just found this on the bottom of my pile.

[02:01:53.820 --> 02:01:54.760]
Meet loaf melt.

[02:01:57.640 --> 02:01:58.840]
It's a sandwich, man.

[02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:01.960]
Like a patty melt.

[02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:06.720]
Anyway, I see meatloaf melt on the menu.

[02:02:08.880 --> 02:02:10.340]
Do you need to eat there?

[02:02:12.060 --> 02:02:13.540]
No, I didn't eat there.

[02:02:14.020 --> 02:02:14.580]
I have.

[02:02:14.580 --> 02:02:15.400]
Yeah, it's great.

[02:02:15.540 --> 02:02:16.240]
Yeah, it's very good.

[02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:18.200]
Well, they have stuffed cabbage too, man.

[02:02:19.300 --> 02:02:21.460]
There's one of that meal-crime-place coral springs.

[02:02:21.740 --> 02:02:22.500]
Empatata pancakes.

[02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:25.780]
There's one right there in the low-medium cramp-place of the plantation.

[02:02:26.280 --> 02:02:27.020]
Right there in university.

[02:02:27.660 --> 02:02:28.960]
Right by that little doggy place.

[02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:30.900]
I can't go over there when I'm down there.

[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.520]
I can't go by that doggy place because I see them little puppies in the window.

[02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:35.060]
And I owe me.

[02:02:35.660 --> 02:02:38.720]
I see a little puppies and I want to buy at least a couple of them and bring them home.

[02:02:38.860 --> 02:02:39.000]
You know?

[02:02:39.420 --> 02:02:42.420]
Can't have no dogs here where I am, so that would be bad.

[02:02:42.420 --> 02:02:43.400]
I don't even have dogs here.

[02:02:44.620 --> 02:02:46.940]
Wouldn't that be a bad surprise to leave somebody a couple of puppies?

[02:02:47.160 --> 02:02:47.300]
Yeah.

[02:02:47.900 --> 02:02:51.500]
Look what's all over your carpet and get dry concepts in here again right away, like every week.

[02:02:51.940 --> 02:02:53.300]
I don't want to go back to that again.

[02:02:53.460 --> 02:02:56.180]
You know, you know, I love dogs, but I just don't want to go through all of it again.

[02:02:56.280 --> 02:02:56.780]
Maybe someday.

[02:02:57.620 --> 02:02:59.360]
This is a really interesting thing.

[02:02:59.780 --> 02:03:01.680]
Annie Groer in the Washington Post.

[02:03:01.800 --> 02:03:03.140]
Who do I tip and how much?

[02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:06.460]
Let's start asking some French Canadians.

[02:03:06.820 --> 02:03:07.840]
Who do you tip and how much?

[02:03:08.760 --> 02:03:10.360]
The gender name of the bay that I own.

[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:12.160]
Yes, the best out of this man.

[02:03:12.280 --> 02:03:12.820]
Oh, barbara.

[02:03:12.860 --> 02:03:15.220]
They are the worst and frogs.

[02:03:15.840 --> 02:03:17.160]
It says, sure, we all know the custom.

[02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:18.740]
Tip the candy, the way Tristabarber.

[02:03:19.020 --> 02:03:20.260]
And we generally agree on the math.

[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:23.180]
15% one standard is now pushing 20%.

[02:03:23.180 --> 02:03:26.860]
In a restaurant, if I get just even halfway decent service, I would leave 20%.

[02:03:26.860 --> 02:03:27.220]
Me too.

[02:03:27.300 --> 02:03:28.060]
It's easier math anyway.

[02:03:28.460 --> 02:03:28.580]
Yeah.

[02:03:28.900 --> 02:03:31.340]
If I get spectacular service, I might even leave like 25.

[02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:32.320]
Maybe even...

[02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:33.240]
Not 30, man.

[02:03:33.600 --> 02:03:35.680]
You know, if I like the waiter, we try to doubt.

[02:03:36.320 --> 02:03:38.860]
But what about people who perform services in our homes?

[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:42.700]
The plumber, the window washer, the hooker, the movers who all up and so up two flights to stairs?

[02:03:43.140 --> 02:03:46.620]
The carpenters and painters who can begin to feel like family during big remodeling projects.

[02:03:47.060 --> 02:03:49.120]
Ask a dozen people whom they tip and why.

[02:03:49.580 --> 02:03:51.020]
And you're likely to get a dozen different answers.

[02:03:51.980 --> 02:03:55.120]
So see, Rimmer never has to worry about the tip because he's not picking up to check anyway.

[02:03:56.280 --> 02:03:57.680]
What's this fax I'm getting here?

[02:03:57.980 --> 02:03:58.500]
Is this from you?

[02:03:58.640 --> 02:03:59.740]
When you see some of these ads.

[02:04:00.340 --> 02:04:01.080]
Oh, no.

[02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:01.920]
There you are again.

[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:04.460]
If it isn't the food he's shoveling off on me, it's that bitch.

[02:04:04.460 --> 02:04:06.140]
Well, that's enough to make me believe the appetite.

[02:04:06.140 --> 02:04:07.060]
So it balances out.

[02:04:07.140 --> 02:04:07.440]
That's right.

[02:04:07.780 --> 02:04:08.720]
She can make anybody look.

[02:04:08.840 --> 02:04:09.740]
But there's very hard to do.

[02:04:09.760 --> 02:04:10.800]
Look at the over 100s.

[02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:11.800]
Constitutional.

[02:04:11.820 --> 02:04:12.600]
Oh, my God.

[02:04:12.940 --> 02:04:15.000]
What Tom Fieler and a Harold did to poor Jerry Hart.

[02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:16.360]
Of course he was asking for it.

[02:04:17.060 --> 02:04:19.960]
Regarding the article on Morning Show, you just read, don't get too excited.

[02:04:19.980 --> 02:04:23.720]
It was in the neighbor section in Broward, which perhaps three old forts read.

[02:04:24.420 --> 02:04:30.280]
At the Streisand Concert and Sunrise, Pat Riley was there as were Dona Shalayli and Miss Fudge.

[02:04:30.500 --> 02:04:31.740]
Miss Fudge was there.

[02:04:31.980 --> 02:04:32.560]
Do you want me to sense?

[02:04:33.040 --> 02:04:33.260]
Yeah.

[02:04:33.260 --> 02:04:38.060]
And then I read on ESPN.com, an article about Red Hour Box Croaking, the article stress says,

[02:04:38.520 --> 02:04:43.180]
I was enjoying the Streisand Concert and Florida when I heard the bad news, written by Dick Bytale.

[02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:44.620]
Have these people no shame?

[02:04:45.200 --> 02:04:45.360]
No.

[02:04:45.740 --> 02:04:46.140]
They don't.

[02:04:46.860 --> 02:04:49.220]
Well, what am I not supposed to give to a Senate about?

[02:04:49.320 --> 02:04:51.720]
The fact that people are paying these wild prices to go see that pig?

[02:04:52.300 --> 02:04:52.480]
No.

[02:04:52.600 --> 02:04:54.540]
The fact that Pat Riley was there or Dona Shalayli?

[02:04:54.740 --> 02:04:55.540]
Or Miss Fudge?

[02:04:56.140 --> 02:04:56.340]
Yeah.

[02:04:56.480 --> 02:04:58.340]
She figures to be a barber Streisand.

[02:04:58.520 --> 02:04:59.860]
All the queens would go to see that.

[02:05:00.740 --> 02:05:09.120]
All the real screamers, Matt, all the closet cases like Miss Fudge, some routinely give extra cash to anyone who helps them out, some never do,

[02:05:09.520 --> 02:05:12.180]
in the way that opposites attract their occasionally married to each other.

[02:05:12.500 --> 02:05:15.200]
The rules for tipping for household services appear totally arbitrary.

[02:05:15.660 --> 02:05:21.780]
Especially this time of the year, think fall planning and tourist boosting up pre-hollity deliveries, generosity can amount up fast.

[02:05:22.720 --> 02:05:26.760]
Call me old-fashioned, but I always tip the people who come to my house to perform a service as Lily T. Arena,

[02:05:26.760 --> 02:05:29.460]
and information security specialist in Virginia.

[02:05:29.800 --> 02:05:34.320]
I believe that most of the people who do service type of jobs are not highly compensated, so I always give them a tip.

[02:05:34.580 --> 02:05:36.600]
One of the first things I do at Woodbine when I go there?

[02:05:36.900 --> 02:05:37.180]
That.

[02:05:37.620 --> 02:05:42.840]
We're not necessarily always the first thing, but I go to the cashier window and I'll take like a $10 bill and say, give me $10 loonies.

[02:05:43.060 --> 02:05:43.580]
There you go.

[02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:44.820]
Loonies a dollar coin.

[02:05:45.140 --> 02:05:46.720]
See, George isn't even taking it back by that.

[02:05:47.120 --> 02:05:48.100]
No, so you got some of the tip.

[02:05:48.600 --> 02:05:52.740]
So I got like, because there are no coins anymore, now that we have the tickets and all the machines, there are no more coins.

[02:05:52.740 --> 02:05:58.480]
What I used to do was take like a $20 and go to a dollar machine and like, you know, cash out the and get all the coins.

[02:05:58.800 --> 02:06:00.820]
But they don't got no coins, no more.

[02:06:01.020 --> 02:06:01.680]
So I go to the window.

[02:06:01.960 --> 02:06:03.280]
There's nothing that bugs me more.

[02:06:03.480 --> 02:06:06.860]
Well, there are a lot of things that bug me more like the smelly obnoxious people like that Italian bitch.

[02:06:08.040 --> 02:06:12.000]
But, oh, I'm like a magic magnet.

[02:06:12.160 --> 02:06:14.860]
I attract these people like honey, a trace bee.

[02:06:15.180 --> 02:06:16.060]
Maybe she wants you.

[02:06:16.440 --> 02:06:16.900]
Yeah, right.

[02:06:17.300 --> 02:06:18.400]
Well, you look like a money bag.

[02:06:18.860 --> 02:06:19.920]
Yeah, the bag's part.

[02:06:20.780 --> 02:06:34.180]
And opposing point of view, no, I do not tip those who mold my lawn clean my gutters, wash my windows, deliver furniture, fix the furnace, renovate the kitchen, upgrade the wiring, says Cindy Gilbert of Adelphine Maryland, a management a list of the federal office of personnel management.

[02:06:34.580 --> 02:06:41.100]
If so, I'd be dead broke from all the tipping and offer the tipping plumbers electricians, you reasons charge out of this world prices for their services.

[02:06:41.560 --> 02:06:42.740]
They're travel time and it's such rates.

[02:06:42.760 --> 02:06:45.140]
I'm sure they already include an hefty tip for themselves anyway.

[02:06:45.140 --> 02:06:55.220]
See, in Europe, they are one of the, I mean, they may hate Americans in general, but one of the reasons they like us is because Americans being stupid, we don't realize the tip is already included in the price in the chat room.

[02:06:55.840 --> 02:07:00.260]
So, generally, because we, you know, feel guilty, we always leave like extra, but not too much.

[02:07:00.660 --> 02:07:05.280]
Even me, I always leave like an extra euro or two or a couple, whatever, you know, change our gun.

[02:07:06.340 --> 02:07:12.820]
Spenser Levine, or is that Levine of suburban Maryland, communication director for nonprofit organization is somewhere in the murky middle.

[02:07:12.820 --> 02:07:18.260]
We tip the pizza delivery guy and the kids we shovel snow from the driveway, even if they don't do an especially good job because they're kids.

[02:07:18.840 --> 02:07:21.040]
I never even had a house painting as a service for which I would tip.

[02:07:21.420 --> 02:07:23.820]
And the same way I'm not going to tip the hundred of the ship when I buy a car.

[02:07:24.220 --> 02:07:26.120]
After a pause, yes, are we doing something wrong?

[02:07:26.900 --> 02:07:29.400]
Tipping the dealership when you buy a car, whoever heard of that.

[02:07:29.720 --> 02:07:32.160]
That me, of course, his name is Levine or Levine.

[02:07:32.580 --> 02:07:35.760]
Perhaps we will find clarity among those working closely in the home service industry.

[02:07:36.060 --> 02:07:36.620]
No such luck.

[02:07:37.020 --> 02:07:39.260]
Typically, plumbers don't get tip of painters do.

[02:07:39.260 --> 02:07:46.220]
There's no rhyme or reason for it's as Angie Hicks, who runs Angie's list, the nationwide series of local rating guides for an array of domestic services.

[02:07:46.600 --> 02:07:51.260]
One thing they keep in mind is that they've gone above and beyond the call of duty and provided exceptional service.

[02:07:51.600 --> 02:07:59.580]
If they come out in the middle of the night, if your trailer was overflowing, for long-haired cruise on contract, Hicks suggest maybe something at the end of the summer, 20 to 50 bucks or the price of a mowing.

[02:07:59.920 --> 02:08:03.240]
And don't forget about the little things such as like a glass of lemonade would be nice.

[02:08:03.240 --> 02:08:11.820]
Yeah, Sarah Smock, marketing director for Mary Maid, the nation's largest residential house cleaning service, says relatively few clients tip during the year.

[02:08:12.140 --> 02:08:18.460]
17% regularly give their weekly or twice monthly cleaners an extra 5 to 10 bucks per visit, although there's more typical of the holidays.

[02:08:19.100 --> 02:08:22.860]
But that's right, Jean, we've got an extra 54-year Christmas time. Have a great life, Jean.

[02:08:23.340 --> 02:08:29.700]
We're working a contractor who is often handsomely paid or his employees is, you know, like when you stay in a hotel, like in Europe, for example.

[02:08:30.200 --> 02:08:31.700]
And you stay like for about eight or nine nights.

[02:08:32.720 --> 02:08:37.740]
When you leave theoretically, you're supposed to leave your change for the chamberman.

[02:08:37.940 --> 02:08:39.140]
For the maid that comes in, please, the room everybody.

[02:08:39.600 --> 02:08:39.780]
Okay.

[02:08:40.180 --> 02:08:45.860]
Now, I've got to pocket full of change. First of all, I got to get rid of it anyway because I don't want to, my pants when I'm going through the skin with the airport.

[02:08:46.540 --> 02:08:50.420]
So what I'll do is I'll take the asterine. I leave my pocket full of change in the asterine.

[02:08:51.060 --> 02:08:54.600]
No matter how much it is, I mean, I just don't want that damn all those euro coins.

[02:08:54.600 --> 02:08:55.800]
So I mean, it's a good point.

[02:08:56.300 --> 02:09:04.640]
Often tipping is a simple expression of niceness as Peter Post, great grandson of Manor's Dorian, Emily Post, author of four etiquette books in a believer in the above and beyond maximum.

[02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:12.260]
If someone hauls a couch up three flights of stairs and moves four pieces of furniture, you want to give them a tip some lunch if they're all day cold drinks, saying thank you is good.

[02:09:12.540 --> 02:09:13.760]
So he's doing a letter of appreciation.

[02:09:14.300 --> 02:09:17.060]
But he rarely offers extra cash. That's not what this is about.

[02:09:17.400 --> 02:09:19.540]
But Pummers electricians, Carpenter's people have built an addition.

[02:09:19.900 --> 02:09:21.520]
The best thing you can do is just pay them right away.

[02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:27.420]
Well, there you go. And Brown, former consumer product safety commission chair, woman has her own system.

[02:09:27.740 --> 02:09:32.780]
She tipped a carpet cleaner who came quickly, worked well and had a really great attitude.

[02:09:33.320 --> 02:09:34.040]
Moving right along.

[02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:40.660]
Oh, I didn't know that came when I wonder when you called my concepts that comes with a cleaning.

[02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:42.420]
I've only ever gotten complacent doing that.

[02:09:45.080 --> 02:09:48.700]
Oh, man, oh man, there's somebody with a way with words.

[02:09:49.280 --> 02:09:51.320]
144 votes on a pool. I think we got 1100.

[02:09:51.580 --> 02:09:52.100]
Look, don't you?

[02:09:53.760 --> 02:09:55.520]
You got to stop at some point. I'm back.

[02:09:55.700 --> 02:09:56.580]
I think we're looking at the end.

[02:09:57.080 --> 02:09:59.780]
The biggest name was the best talent in the basis.

[02:10:00.040 --> 02:10:00.200]
No.

[02:10:00.360 --> 02:10:00.360]

[02:10:01.200 --> 02:10:02.720]
Forge radio 560.

[02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:04.060]
You A L.

[02:10:05.720 --> 02:10:07.380]
Not just the one to two hour.

[02:10:07.760 --> 02:10:08.700]
It's a phenomenon.

[02:10:09.400 --> 02:10:12.380]
Don't miss the latest must have sensation to hit stores.

[02:10:12.420 --> 02:10:14.580]
It's the tickle me bush dog.

[02:10:16.600 --> 02:10:22.000]
This chattering little character from the pencil being avenue beltway gang will laugh at anything you say.

[02:10:22.120 --> 02:10:23.000]
Till old George W.

[02:10:23.160 --> 02:10:25.620]
With two pluses all tried up and he'll laugh.

[02:10:27.380 --> 02:10:31.560]
Till him is military couldn't fight a boy scout jamboree on a warm summer day.

[02:10:31.880 --> 02:10:33.420]
And he can't help but laugh.

[02:10:35.180 --> 02:10:42.620]
And you'll laugh too as the tickle me bush dog puckers his face to one side and wiggles his ape like ears uncontrollably.

[02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:48.840]
Tickle me bush is sure to be the biggest fan since the outboard grows a beard.

[02:10:48.980 --> 02:10:54.200]
Sheep hat you'll laugh you'll cry you'll kiss 4999 goodbye with the tickle me bush dog.

[02:10:54.400 --> 02:10:55.360]
Every Republican household.

[02:10:55.360 --> 02:11:00.000]
He sure to have what if you aren't now 10% of every dog's soul will support stem cell research.

[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:03.120]
The miss of the fence shield and Alaska oil drilling.

[02:11:04.280 --> 02:11:06.720]
He's got a he's hysterical.

[02:11:07.080 --> 02:11:08.940]
He's got ape like ears.

[02:11:08.940 --> 02:11:10.960]
It's the tickle me bush dog.

[02:11:11.200 --> 02:11:14.560]
Nails open stores work with guns ammo and NRA propaganda are sold.

[02:11:14.980 --> 02:11:19.200]
103 of five sixty WQ MSR gigantic world flamey one to two hour.

[02:11:19.500 --> 02:11:23.300]
Wait till you hear this you will not be you won't be too happy about it where you sure won't be surprised.

[02:11:23.580 --> 02:11:23.760]
Okay.

[02:11:24.340 --> 02:11:25.760]
Riches cited early voting.

[02:11:26.100 --> 02:11:26.520]
Oh gee.

[02:11:26.760 --> 02:11:27.160]
What a surprise.

[02:11:27.620 --> 02:11:33.640]
Early voters urged to cast their ballots with great care following scattered reports of problems with heavily used machines.

[02:11:33.640 --> 02:11:43.940]
After a week of early voting a handful of glitches with electronic voting machines have drawn the IRO voters reassurances from election supervisors and a caution against the careless casting of ballots.

[02:11:44.520 --> 02:11:49.900]
Several South Voter voters say the choices they touch on electronic screens were not the ones that appeared on the review screen.

[02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:55.960]
The final voting step election officials say they're not aware of any serious voting issues but in Broward for example in.

[02:11:56.780 --> 02:12:04.700]
They don't know how widespread the machine problems are because there's no process for poll workers to quickly report minor issues and no central database of machine problems.

[02:12:04.960 --> 02:12:10.120]
Indeed incidents are logged and reported daily and recorded in a central database and judges cracking his fingers again.

[02:12:10.380 --> 02:12:11.780]
The problem machines are shut down.

[02:12:11.960 --> 02:12:12.040]
What?

[02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:19.460]
I said in the past dead county would send someone to correct the machine on sites at Lester's Sola county supervisor elections.

[02:12:19.460 --> 02:12:22.760]
Now he said we close the machine down and put a seal on it.

[02:12:23.160 --> 02:12:26.600]
So if you walk in and go vote you see a seal flopping around top of the machine stay away from that one.

[02:12:27.160 --> 02:12:33.420]
Never read voted with her boss on Wednesday at African American Research Library and cultural center near for Lauderdale.

[02:12:33.780 --> 02:12:38.620]
Her vote went smoothly but boss Gary Rudolph called her over to look at what was happening on his machine.

[02:12:39.060 --> 02:12:45.640]
He touched the screen for gubernatorial candidate Jim Davis the Democrat but the review screen repeatedly registered the Republican Charlie Gay.

[02:12:45.640 --> 02:12:54.640]
Chris that's exactly the kind of problem that sends conspiracy theorists into high gear especially in South Florida where a history of problems at the polls have made voters especially skittish.

[02:12:55.460 --> 02:12:57.340]
What history of problems at the polls?

[02:12:57.540 --> 02:13:02.980]
Oh I don't know they just make them that up you know the hero a poll worker then helped do it all but it took three tries to get it right.

[02:13:04.180 --> 02:13:08.060]
So if you want to vote for Davis you better vote three times just to be sure.

[02:13:08.740 --> 02:13:17.020]
I'm shocked but I because I really want to trust that the issues with the regularities with voting machines have been resulted read a paralegal and worries me because the races are so close.

[02:13:17.500 --> 02:13:22.220]
Here's a fact that since I'm tuning in late today so I'm hope I'm not being redundant I took the time to read the article posted.

[02:13:22.520 --> 02:13:29.620]
He'll await a mirror from smoking chimpy Jason Miller maybe the finest analysis I've read in quite some time that article deserves a live reading.

[02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:32.920]
Thanks for posting these articles I feel like I'm cheating by taking advantage of your efforts.

[02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:38.000]
You are a quit doing it not I feel like I'm cheating by taking advantage of it's why do you think we do it?

[02:13:38.100 --> 02:13:44.900]
Right so people will read the stuff man because people don't read anything like that article we had about the newspaper circulation being weighed down.

[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:50.480]
People don't read maybe at least they know read newspapers hopefully they read on the internet like nearrangers.com right.

[02:13:50.580 --> 02:13:56.660]
I beg we plead we pray and because so many people are reading it these days Josh has decided to give out that email address.

[02:13:57.860 --> 02:14:02.080]
I think it's interesting Joe we're ever going to do that although it's a great idea though don't you think?

[02:14:02.220 --> 02:14:10.160]
Oh yeah you can watch me copy the bonus trouble yeah keep him inside all the time morning noon and night even during the show.

[02:14:10.480 --> 02:14:14.580]
We would be able to eat all that ice cream all the other crap and when it was big bags of candy come in at Georgia's ordering.

[02:14:14.980 --> 02:14:15.360]
Not me.

[02:14:15.580 --> 02:14:17.560]
I'm so sorry that I found that Roger's ice cream.

[02:14:17.660 --> 02:14:17.820]
Oh.

[02:14:18.620 --> 02:14:20.540]
Why did you start that without Mary Jane?

[02:14:20.540 --> 02:14:27.280]
If you have any idea what I titanic lightning bolt that struck through my head when you started talking about Mary Jane can.

[02:14:29.780 --> 02:14:38.420]
Broward Supervisor Relations spokeswoman Mary Cooney said it's not uncommon for screens on heavily used machines to slip out of sync making votes register incorrectly.

[02:14:38.800 --> 02:14:39.220]
Oh wonderful.

[02:14:39.680 --> 02:14:44.560]
Pull workers are trained to be calibrate them on the spot essentially to realign the video screen with electronics inside.

[02:14:44.960 --> 02:14:47.440]
The 15 step process is outlined in the poll workers manual.

[02:14:47.800 --> 02:14:49.120]
The 15 step process.

[02:14:49.120 --> 02:14:50.220]
Please say cake.

[02:14:50.340 --> 02:14:52.500]
It's resolved right this see there he goes again.

[02:14:53.900 --> 02:14:54.260]
Faster.

[02:14:54.860 --> 02:15:04.220]

[02:16:40.820 --> 02:17:03.160]
says for and the last two paragraphs so revel in the mass delusions suck the marrow that the wretched may know upon the bones and exercise your conscience and for God's sake savor each second the ride because hell awaits America isn't that uplifting right in the middle lunch hour it's a little extra one on nine which is shy of the beach boys and four or nine wasn't PT one or nine was that the adf k boat yes it was

[02:17:04.180 --> 02:17:22.280]
1667 boats on a pool we got that 1100 to lick we're getting our licks and what was that thing about tickle my what on that that I just played fancy tickle my fancy Republican senator John McCain who never found a war that he wasn't enchanted with said Friday the US should send another 20,000 troops to Iraq oh my god

[02:17:22.280 --> 02:17:33.140]
I remember the Senate armed services committee McCain said increasing US forces would require expanding the standing army Marine Corps a step to Bush administration has resisted another 20,000 troops in Iraq but that means expanding the air

[02:17:33.140 --> 02:17:49.480]
Army Marine Corps he said McCain's call for escalation would exacerbate the deteriorating situation in Iraq would only further damage US national security rights so this is from a thing progress as the website and here's at least two reasons why it says one no troops to send sending more troops to Iraq would at the moment

[02:17:49.480 --> 02:18:00.020]
threaten to break our nations all volunteer army and under my national security McCain suggest in in largely the forces send them to Iraq an idea that's impossible to carry out over the short term and that would damage the military's ability to

[02:18:00.020 --> 02:18:12.720]
recruit over the long term and to the insurgency would grow more inflamed as in finding a more visible present of US troops were as further stoking the flames of the insurgency by feeding perceptions of long term US

[02:18:12.720 --> 02:18:19.540]
occupation among many Iraqis the recent effort to increase to troop numbers and bag that is only increased violence a recent poll of Iraqis

[02:18:19.540 --> 02:18:25.480]
indicate that support for attacks on US forces has grown away majority positions now six out of 10 a number sure to increase

[02:18:25.480 --> 02:18:34.720]
of more US troops are put on the ground phase withdrawal is gaining consensus is the best the last best option for Iraq a growing group of experts including the Iraq study group and a

[02:18:34.720 --> 02:18:45.720]
host of conservative senators are consolidating behind a redeployment 63% of Americans believe Congress should set a time table now pronto right subito

[02:18:45.720 --> 02:18:51.480]
see quickly dot thousand seventy votes and that pull about ladies man women

[02:18:51.480 --> 02:18:59.700]
is good like everything else is good ones is bad ones is beautiful ones are sexy ones is grotesque ones are spat ones are smelly ones are tall ones ensure

[02:18:59.700 --> 02:19:12.740]
one what's the worst thing about women mood swings to fourteen non stop bitching one eighty three is a way to solve that you know never say what they mean one thirty two nagging one twenty two nagging and bitching and

[02:19:12.740 --> 02:19:22.440]
owning and whining unrealistic expectations one eighteen when they get saggy and sloppy they ain't good eighty nine I hate this pool seventy four six point nine percent nothing

their great women are all great fifty six there's obviously somebody some guys didn't get around too much they never forget thirty seven and they'll never let you

[02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:35.780]
forget that's part of the nagging thing no sense to humor thirty two and rest of commitment fourteen you don't even have your pants off yet

[02:19:35.780 --> 02:19:43.500]
and nobody want to ring you know which I guess is easy if you got a ring around the color yeah like a priest for example he's always got the ring

[02:19:43.500 --> 02:19:49.300]
around his neck mm-hmm I don't think that a lot of these priest ought to have like something around around it like a noose would be sure who's around the

Then I saw a new splash on Channel 10

[02:22:14.590 --> 02:22:18.330]
Some may repeat for all together in a bunch

[02:22:18.330 --> 02:22:23.330]

Here's what Joshua is talking about

[02:23:22.790 --> 02:23:27.950]
I had nothing about this Trevor Burbrick right yeah, I just saw the headline Jamaican

[02:23:27.950 --> 02:23:31.290]
police have made a second arrest in a machete slaying a former Canadian in the world

[02:23:31.290 --> 02:23:33.290]
heavyweight boxing champ Trevor Burbrick

[02:23:33.910 --> 02:23:37.270]
ah ah your rest came Sunday night last night after hours of questioning the first

[02:23:37.270 --> 02:23:41.810]
aspect a 20-year-old man said Carl Angel directed communications from the Jamaican

[02:23:41.810 --> 02:23:47.010]
Constabulary Force early today from his office in Kingston Jamaica man how do you

[02:23:47.010 --> 02:23:47.390]
like that?

[02:23:48.490 --> 02:23:52.490]
the Constabulary Burbrick the 52-year-old former World Champ who once

[02:23:52.490 --> 02:23:56.050]
beat the legendary Muhammad Ali was found dead with multiple head wounds in the

[02:23:56.050 --> 02:23:59.950]
yard of Norwich Baptist Chapel across the road from his home in the district of

[02:23:59.950 --> 02:24:02.950]
Norwich early Saturday police have said the wounds to the back of his head

[02:24:02.950 --> 02:24:06.630]
were likely caused by a machete which in rural Jamaica's primary farm

[02:24:06.630 --> 02:24:09.630]
implement for the small farmer I wonder if it's like the one we got sitting on

[02:24:09.630 --> 02:24:13.290]
the counter there that OJ machete a through to what you did yeah it didn't work

[02:24:13.870 --> 02:24:17.590]
Norwich is a quiet community on the islands northeast about 120 kilometers 72

[02:24:17.590 --> 02:24:21.310]
miles from the capital Kingston Angel said that rumors were rife at the slaying

[02:24:21.310 --> 02:24:24.890]
stem from a dispute over land however we can't confirm this he said a land

[02:24:24.890 --> 02:24:28.290]
dispute there are also rumors of conflict with neighbors or within the Burbrick

[02:24:28.290 --> 02:24:31.990]
family neighbors of the former champ reached by telephone were reluctant to be

[02:24:31.990 --> 02:24:35.390]
named but also that neighborhood is quiet and safe one church member a neighbor

[02:24:35.390 --> 02:24:39.330]
Burbrick said the former champ seemed down on his luck he had returned to the

[02:24:39.330 --> 02:24:42.290]
community where he was born after being deported from the US Burbrick had apparently

[02:24:42.290 --> 02:24:45.910]
been in conflict over family property that he sought to reassert control over

[02:24:45.910 --> 02:24:50.450]
after so many years of broad Burbrick fought professionally from 1976 to 2000

[02:24:50.450 --> 02:24:55.310]
finishing with a record of 50 and 111 dry and 33 knockouts he fought for Jamaica

[02:24:55.310 --> 02:24:59.990]
at the 1976 Montreal Olympics and became a Canadian landed immigrant in 1979

[02:24:59.990 --> 02:25:03.310]
shortly after beginning his pro boxing career while living in a Halifax

[02:25:03.310 --> 02:25:08.570]
say Halifax Nova Scotia while you think you're seeing cold baby I can't even begin to imagine

[02:25:08.570 --> 02:25:12.450]
he quickly won the Canadian heavyweight title and moved to Florida in the early 80s

[02:25:12.450 --> 02:25:15.930]
just as his boxing career was taken off you see how ill-fated it is

[02:25:15.930 --> 02:25:19.490]
people they write a movie to Florida oh my god their lives turned to cramp

[02:25:19.490 --> 02:25:23.930]
in 1981 he beat an aging Ali in the Bahamas in the final fight of the boxing legends career

[02:25:23.930 --> 02:25:28.430]
in 86 he won the WC heavyweight title and decision over Pinkland Thomas

[02:25:28.430 --> 02:25:32.550]
eight months later he lost the title of 20 year old Mike Tyson by a knockout

[02:25:32.550 --> 02:25:35.350]
Burbrick later claimed that he was drugged before that fight

[02:25:35.350 --> 02:25:40.490]
how do you like that huh his legal problems began as his boxing career began to win in 1991

[02:25:40.490 --> 02:25:43.970]
he was convicted of a misdemeanor assault for a technic former business manager

[02:25:43.970 --> 02:25:49.230]
who testified the boxer put a gun to her head and accused her of stealing 40 grand U.S. from him

[02:25:49.230 --> 02:25:53.130]
the following year is convicted in the sexual assault of a 16 year old Florida babysitter

[02:25:53.130 --> 02:25:56.990]
it was sentenced to four years in prison it was also convicted of the secondary grand theft

[02:25:56.990 --> 02:26:01.910]
for forging his ex-wife signature to get a 95 thousand dollar mortgage on his Miramar home

[02:26:01.910 --> 02:26:06.630]
oh sounds like a really slimy kind of guy he served 15 months in those convictions was

[02:26:06.630 --> 02:26:10.610]
ordered deported to Jamaica man but before it could be removed Burbrick's like to Canada

[02:26:10.610 --> 02:26:14.710]
moving first to Montreal for non-successful attempt to resurrect his boxing career and then to

[02:26:14.710 --> 02:26:19.830]
BC and otherwise he took a powder to BC in February 99 while in Montreal Burbrick defeated

[02:26:19.830 --> 02:26:24.110]
chain sucklif to win the Canadian heavyweight title for the second time aren't you impressed

[02:26:24.110 --> 02:26:29.030]
that was later disputed because unknown to Canadian boxing officials he'd been stripped of

[02:26:29.230 --> 02:26:34.050]
status as a landed immigrant have been deported from Canada six months earlier but in December

[02:26:34.050 --> 02:26:39.230]
99 an immigration appeal panel granted Burbrick a five year stay meaning he could apply for

[02:26:39.230 --> 02:26:43.470]
citizenship after that time if he kept out of trouble Burbrick left BC and returned to Florida

[02:26:43.470 --> 02:26:49.370]
where warrant had been issued for his arrest and was deported to Jamaica in 2002 and is dead

[02:26:49.370 --> 02:26:55.430]

[02:29:23.870 --> 02:29:30.350]
1-800-matts-res leave off the last s because it stands for spectacular savings and

[02:29:30.350 --> 02:29:31.930]
silly sales holes.

[02:29:31.930 --> 02:29:38.110]
these names of test shallope engines to engines to be your broad house for your 5.60

[02:29:46.630 --> 02:29:48.290]
made it up

[02:29:48.290 --> 02:29:48.590]
by

[02:29:48.590 --> 02:29:50.930]
I hope not just any fun.

[02:29:54.030 --> 02:29:57.170]
I try to act for others of the type of life.

[02:29:57.290 --> 02:29:59.070]
It's in, in, in, in, in, that right.

[02:30:06.010 --> 02:30:10.070]
Abu Gaur, Abu Abu, Abu Gaur, Abu Abu Gaur.

[02:30:10.270 --> 02:30:12.130]
Well, I try to do I go on.

[02:30:19.550 --> 02:30:48.570]
I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I

[02:30:51.510 --> 02:31:05.970]
I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that email is mc7 Egg

[02:31:06.610 --> 02:31:11.870]
Outlines and extraordinary wishlist of how the government would like to world-like world-trouble spots to look in ten years time

[02:31:11.870 --> 02:31:15.250]
It also signals a draft to reduce Britain's military commitments around the globe

[02:31:15.250 --> 02:31:20.930]
It admits that in our ideal world the Muslims would not perceive the UK in its foreign policies as hostile

[02:31:20.930 --> 02:31:27.730]
Effectively except the argument that Britain's military action in Iraq and Afghanistan has served as a recruiting sergeant for Islamist terrorist groups

[02:31:27.730 --> 02:31:33.730]
Publicly Mr. Blair has resisted this line fiercely during his final speech as leader of the labor's annual conference last month

[02:31:33.730 --> 02:31:36.070]
He describes such claims as enemy propaganda

[02:31:36.750 --> 02:31:41.510]
But the memo leaves no doubt that all foreign policy must be driven by the goal of sorting terrorism in Britain

[02:31:41.510 --> 02:31:46.690]
It demands a significant reduction in the number and intensity of the regional conference that fuel terror activity

[02:31:46.690 --> 02:31:48.310]
Now just to go into this okay

[02:31:48.310 --> 02:31:50.970]
They're not pissed off because they're like killing all those people over there

[02:31:50.970 --> 02:31:53.210]
It just they're all worked up their temperament

[02:31:53.210 --> 02:31:57.030]
That's not that people are pissed off drop bombs on them. They'll start loving you then. That's right

[02:31:57.670 --> 02:32:02.810]
Margaret Carlson in the Seattle Post until you know Margaret Carlson. She's always on whatever the TV show is on Sunday

[02:32:02.810 --> 02:32:07.730]
She's on those shows with a glasses come on you better start watching those panels shows man

[02:32:07.730 --> 02:32:13.950]
Hope like what's that one McLaughlin in company better start watching that when President Bush wakes up in the night

[02:32:13.950 --> 02:32:18.790]
Does he wonder how the family of 20-year-old lands corporal Clifford Collinsworth who was killed last week in Iraq

[02:32:18.790 --> 02:32:25.090]
Coats with the loss does he think about whether the almost three thousand other US deaths there have been worth it at Bush's press conference

[02:32:25.090 --> 02:32:30.470]
October 25 as he twisted his mouth to speak out of one side of it his very words seem to pain him

[02:32:30.470 --> 02:32:35.990]
I know many Americans are not satisfied he said I'm not either but we can't allow our dissatisfaction to turn in this illusion

[02:32:35.990 --> 02:32:41.770]
And some of the bad news is sophisticated propagated by the enemy he said now once to the other phrase stay the course

[02:32:41.770 --> 02:32:46.770]
Which has been removed from the White House talking points the way portraits of discredited leaders were moved from the Kremlin

[02:32:47.210 --> 02:32:51.450]
What's forcing the banishment is not the looming defeat in Iraq but the one looming at the polls

[02:32:51.450 --> 02:32:56.390]
Bush told George step on top of us recently that we've never been stayed the course his press secretary

[02:32:56.390 --> 02:33:00.370]
The Abnaxia's Tony Snow said the words haven't passed Bush's lips since August 31

[02:33:00.370 --> 02:33:08.070]
You only have to click on you cheer to see a video of at least 50 times over last year when the president invoked those words and describe his Iraq policy

[02:33:08.070 --> 02:33:12.430]
Stay the course Bush now says he was only distinguishing himself from those who would leave abruptly

[02:33:12.430 --> 02:33:19.250]
He's this month. He's been misunderstood if anyone thought he wasn't wasn't a proponent of adjusting his tactics as the situation demanded

[02:33:19.250 --> 02:33:22.190]
No one has claimed that Bush might be slow to change tactics

[02:33:22.190 --> 02:33:27.850]
But he changes them the awful truth is not that military tactics haven't changed it's that they have changed and failed

[02:33:27.850 --> 02:33:34.130]
This is where slogan substituting for policy can get you in a trouble with just days to go before the election

[02:33:34.130 --> 02:33:38.310]
It's time for some new spin although in bush line. It's certainly not time for new policies

[02:33:38.310 --> 02:33:43.690]
I'm reminded of Bush's father during his 1992 election campaign when accused of ignoring struggling workers

[02:33:43.690 --> 02:33:48.230]
He responded message I care rather than by actually doing anything for them

[02:33:48.230 --> 02:33:52.870]
Like state the course the current president meant that despite what you rise tell you victories around the corner

[02:33:52.870 --> 02:33:57.470]
voters just need to stick with someone with resolve like him as opposed to the Democrats or defeated

[02:33:57.470 --> 02:34:02.510]
Cretz who would cut and run before the job is done with evidence that there's little Americans can do now to spend the worst

[02:34:02.510 --> 02:34:06.450]
New violence Democrats successfully turns state of course against the Republicans now

[02:34:06.450 --> 02:34:11.090]
Indagent Republicans are urging the White House to inform voters that you don't have to do anything so rash

[02:34:11.090 --> 02:34:15.330]
And it's about democratic to get the country out of Iraq changing course might save lives

[02:34:15.330 --> 02:34:20.630]
But it's too painful for Bush to swallow requiring as it does some admission that Iraq is descending in a way chaos that

[02:34:20.630 --> 02:34:25.410]
Americans are helpless to stop a new course may involve unpleasant options such as dividing Iraq and with loose

[02:34:25.410 --> 02:34:29.850]
Confederation pushing out Prime Minister Malachi who was never willing to control the Shiite militias

[02:34:29.850 --> 02:34:33.970]
And listing Iran and Syria in a regional diplomatic effort or toughest of all sending more troops

[02:34:33.970 --> 02:34:38.150]
General George Casey the top US commander in Iraq put that last option on the table

[02:34:38.150 --> 02:34:41.710]
Although he heads by and then would likely mean reassigning troops already in the country

[02:34:41.710 --> 02:34:46.830]
You can you can bet Bush's flexibility staffs at least before the election at sending new troops to a place that

[02:34:46.830 --> 02:34:48.250]
Majority of Americans have given up on

[02:34:48.250 --> 02:34:52.090]
The White House may be all too mindful of the addictive salted peanut phenomenon

[02:34:52.090 --> 02:34:55.510]
Former Secretary of State Kishn to war Nixon about after he took office

[02:34:55.930 --> 02:34:58.190]
Kishn to your now informal advisor to Bush on Iraq

[02:34:58.190 --> 02:35:01.770]
Said that if Nixon were to begin withdrawing troops from Vietnam before the next US election

[02:35:01.770 --> 02:35:05.870]
It would set off a hunger for more withdrawals and be an acknowledgement that mistakes were made

[02:35:05.870 --> 02:35:09.690]
Nixon's domestic enemies would never be satisfied and they were in lead defeat he said

[02:35:09.690 --> 02:35:12.930]
Bush is keeping company with the wrong former Secretary of State

[02:35:12.930 --> 02:35:16.750]
James Baker coach him in the Iraq Steady Group with former representative Lee Hamilton

[02:35:16.750 --> 02:35:21.270]
Has said his recommendations would be to put more options on the table than merely to say the course

[02:35:21.810 --> 02:35:23.830]
Unfortunately Baker is playing out the election clock

[02:35:23.830 --> 02:35:27.750]
A great now to wish recommendations and to laugh at the midterm congressional elections

[02:35:27.750 --> 02:35:29.730]
Death won't stop him in a Bush changes course

[02:35:29.730 --> 02:35:31.390]
But that's not an argument for waiting

[02:35:31.390 --> 02:35:35.350]
Changing course won't bring back corporal Collins worth yet it could save his bunkmate

[02:35:36.570 --> 02:35:38.530]
What do we got here on the fast machine mine

[02:35:39.370 --> 02:35:43.930]
Rod Rigo says Friday you read article about Kristen a 16-year-old roommate in St. Petersburg

[02:35:43.930 --> 02:35:49.010]
The article spoke of Charlie using his parents' arrest for tax purposes and the 16-year-old using the home they shared

[02:35:49.010 --> 02:35:51.130]
Why was this information now put on your website?

[02:35:51.730 --> 02:35:52.290]
Well, what does that mean?

[02:35:52.890 --> 02:35:54.050]
Rod Rigo, that's what it means

[02:35:54.050 --> 02:35:57.010]
Sounds like he's a bust in our chops or something

[02:35:57.010 --> 02:35:57.530]
Yeah

[02:35:57.530 --> 02:36:01.570]
Because somebody faxed it in and I have no idea where it originally came from Rod Rigo

[02:36:01.570 --> 02:36:04.750]
That's the answer why if somebody wants to refax it and tell me what the source was

[02:36:04.750 --> 02:36:08.150]
It's a matter of fact after the show I googled it to see if I could find where the hell that came from

[02:36:08.150 --> 02:36:13.030]
I couldn't do it. Although I found when you when you're typing Charlie, Chris and Gay in Google

[02:36:13.030 --> 02:36:16.290]
You find all sorts of stuff that comes in it pops up

[02:36:16.290 --> 02:36:18.850]
Like that as if there's any doubt

[02:36:19.390 --> 02:36:21.350]
That's why Rod Rigo troublemaker

[02:36:22.430 --> 02:36:25.850]
1122 votes on it pull we're not doing back considering we had that late start last night

[02:36:25.850 --> 02:36:29.810]
You know, I don't think that the bill will be satisfied with 1100 and so my votes

[02:36:30.270 --> 02:36:33.030]
Although I think we have some day parts that don't have quite that many listeners

[02:36:33.950 --> 02:36:36.050]
You know what I'm saying no I didn't say a thing

[02:36:36.050 --> 02:36:41.110]
You said you're hallucinating again because of that Mary Jane because you got that molasses all over your chin

[02:36:41.110 --> 02:36:42.310]
I don't know you talking about

[02:36:44.470 --> 02:36:51.110]
God you had to start with that well I'm gonna you know I'm gonna do nothing I hope no and in the last break when the last break starts

[02:36:51.110 --> 02:36:55.950]
It about whenever it's gonna be I'm gonna go and put on my pot of boiling water. Oh there you go

[02:36:55.950 --> 02:36:58.830]
I'm gonna go in there. I'm gonna slice up my wiener for the sauce

[02:36:58.830 --> 02:37:02.370]
We're gonna slice up your wiener for the sauce and when you boil the pot it sounds like this

[02:37:03.670 --> 02:37:06.050]
Yeah, and then I'm gonna make my low carb pasta for lunch

[02:37:06.050 --> 02:37:11.990]
So I don't wind up rushing out and buy a bunch of that Roger's ice cream or looking for a bunch of Mary Jane's or cart bars very

[02:37:11.990 --> 02:37:12.950]
You love cart bars?

[02:37:13.310 --> 02:37:13.670]
Uh

[02:37:14.130 --> 02:37:14.490]
No

[02:37:14.490 --> 02:37:21.230]
I like them but I like my butter fingers. Yeah, butter fingers are good and the best thing about the butter fingers is

[02:37:21.230 --> 02:37:24.930]
Signing the sweet thing and you get to enjoy them all day long because they get stuck in your teeth

[02:37:24.930 --> 02:37:28.770]
Yeah, cart bars do to their chewy new man new good man

[02:37:28.770 --> 02:37:32.650]
Just like we said about when is your wedding lesbian on we told new good and what we said

[02:37:33.130 --> 02:37:37.950]
And started to sound like maybe they did just little little tiny baby nukes that saw you know

[02:37:37.950 --> 02:37:39.150]
I'll get all bent out of shape

[02:37:39.150 --> 02:37:43.650]
Don't start with that anti-stimatic crap again about the Israelis did this and these were you know

[02:37:43.650 --> 02:37:48.770]
Just a little tiny teeny baby nukes you first start, you know just to send a message like Joey Zaza

[02:37:48.770 --> 02:37:51.890]
He was gonna send a message that's right. He was just horseing around

[02:37:52.350 --> 02:37:52.750]
Joey

[02:37:53.850 --> 02:37:54.250]
Zaza

[02:37:54.770 --> 02:37:58.490]
See that movie wasn't as bad as you thought that's just like it was it was that thing was okay

[02:37:58.490 --> 02:38:01.370]
There were some good scenes in there like when the archbishop got

[02:38:02.710 --> 02:38:04.190]
Went flying down those stairs

[02:38:05.370 --> 02:38:09.610]
20 till two we got the mad dog back from a short wherever the hell he went last week

oh

[02:39:57.510 --> 02:39:57.510]

[02:40:21.910 --> 02:40:25.190]
Time to deal with the FCC

[02:40:30.910 --> 02:40:33.650]
Where the network comes between

[02:40:33.650 --> 02:40:37.330]
Far-fraud's casting new regime

[02:40:37.910 --> 02:40:42.330]
We should not see that for free on TV

[02:40:45.910 --> 02:40:48.590]
That's what HBO is for

[02:40:49.590 --> 02:40:52.310]
Still a flag sort of porn song

[02:40:53.590 --> 02:40:57.430]
Why are they going hardcore all they need?

[02:40:59.470 --> 02:41:01.470]
Oh, Disney

[02:41:02.590 --> 02:41:05.190]
Let's move for straight

[02:41:06.590 --> 02:41:09.230]
I've been walked in, Disney

[02:41:09.230 --> 02:41:12.730]
Rollin' over in this grave

[02:41:13.730 --> 02:41:14.230]
It's a dream

[02:41:18.350 --> 02:41:19.570]
Make it work

[02:41:20.730 --> 02:41:23.410]
So long to be make it work

[02:41:23.410 --> 02:41:25.750]
Right on the ABC

[02:41:25.750 --> 02:41:27.210]
Make it work

[02:41:28.370 --> 02:41:30.250]
Like Kevin Jackson

[02:41:30.250 --> 02:41:32.150]
That calls Rollin'

[02:41:32.770 --> 02:41:36.110]
Made at the college share again

[02:41:36.730 --> 02:41:38.850]
I've read that this is HBO

[02:41:38.850 --> 02:41:40.990]
Because I smit can't ask another that

[02:41:40.990 --> 02:41:43.590]
Thanks for sending me before about that thing that's coming up on HBO

[02:41:43.590 --> 02:41:44.670]
I can resend it

[02:41:44.670 --> 02:41:45.590]
Resend it please

[02:41:45.590 --> 02:41:49.070]
And the meantime I do do that just to pacify Rodrigo

[02:41:49.070 --> 02:41:50.190]
Who I'll be saying is an agenda

[02:41:50.190 --> 02:41:51.930]
Maybe he's got the hospital for Charlie Christ

[02:41:52.850 --> 02:41:54.910]
Gabriel Rotello in the Huffington Post writes

[02:41:55.470 --> 02:42:00.570]
He says why are Florida's news media engaged in a conspiracy of silence concerning a core issue in the upcoming election

[02:42:00.570 --> 02:42:04.130]
The truthfulness and honesty of the Republican frontrunner for Governor Charlie Christ

[02:42:04.130 --> 02:42:06.670]
For those who haven't heard the situation is this

[02:42:06.670 --> 02:42:10.910]
Multiple sources have come forward, alleging first-hand knowledge that Christ is gay

[02:42:10.910 --> 02:42:13.450]
And or has had homosexual affairs

[02:42:13.450 --> 02:42:17.530]
Christ has been asked about in public generally by reporters from the alternative media

[02:42:17.530 --> 02:42:22.330]
By constituents and meetings and by talk show host and is adamantly and repeatedly denied it

[02:42:22.330 --> 02:42:25.670]
And the mainstream media have not reported a word of any of this to Florida voters

[02:42:25.670 --> 02:42:30.010]
Full disclosure as a gay person living in an era where gay shoes often dominate politics

[02:42:30.010 --> 02:42:33.370]
I think that it candidates sexual orientation is as relevant to his campaign

[02:42:33.370 --> 02:42:37.910]
As things like his mirrored al-Status or religion or how many kids he has sometimes even more so

[02:42:37.910 --> 02:42:43.210]
For example, Christy poses a adoption by gay couples and favors a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage

[02:42:43.210 --> 02:42:48.010]
If I were Florida voter these facts would raise a host of moral, ethical and even psychological questions

[02:42:48.010 --> 02:42:49.710]
If Christy himself is a gay man

[02:42:49.710 --> 02:42:52.350]
But even if you don't care whether or not Christy's gay history

[02:42:52.350 --> 02:42:56.210]
And with the Niles raised serious and legitimate questions about his truthfulness and credibility

[02:42:56.210 --> 02:42:59.710]
Just like Gary Hart's Niles of extra-mirrored affairs raised questions about his

[02:42:59.710 --> 02:43:04.230]
And just like with Gary Hart those denials cry out for a serious media examination

[02:43:04.230 --> 02:43:08.250]
After all the traditional solution for gay politicians who want to remain in the closet

[02:43:08.250 --> 02:43:10.350]
Retain their integrity avoid media scrutiny

[02:43:10.350 --> 02:43:13.310]
It's to simply refuse to answer questions about their sexuality

[02:43:13.310 --> 02:43:16.130]
Even the odious Mark Foley never denied he was gay

[02:43:16.130 --> 02:43:20.190]
He just attacked the question as irrelevant and the questioners as intrusive

[02:43:20.190 --> 02:43:23.950]
But Christ's denials are absolute he has an effect there the media to prove him a liar

[02:43:23.950 --> 02:43:28.270]
And how has Florida's mainstream media respawned in the way that they complete silence on Mark Foley

[02:43:28.270 --> 02:43:29.810]
With more complete silence

[02:43:30.350 --> 02:43:33.750]
Although Christy led homosexual activity is the whispered talk of Florida

[02:43:34.270 --> 02:43:36.310]
Although it's been impressively detailed in the alternative

[02:43:36.310 --> 02:43:38.210]
Broward Palm Beach new times

[02:43:38.210 --> 02:43:42.130]
Although it's being openly discussed by Christy old friend and curvy form party opponent Max Linn

[02:43:42.130 --> 02:43:44.010]
And I sticked on the Ziggian websites

[02:43:44.010 --> 02:43:46.810]
You wouldn't know any of this from reading the Miami hero of the Palm Beach Post

[02:43:46.810 --> 02:43:49.090]
Or any of the other mainstream media outlets in the state

[02:43:49.910 --> 02:43:53.730]
You get the impression that the Florida media feel that because allegations were sometimes

[02:43:53.730 --> 02:43:57.890]
And now certainly always couched as political smears by Christ right wing primary opponent

[02:43:57.890 --> 02:43:59.970]
The Rock limits to respectable reporters

[02:43:59.970 --> 02:44:05.290]
But it bears repeating that the fundamental issue for journalists is not Charlie Christy led homosexuality

[02:44:05.290 --> 02:44:11.370]
It's his honesty and integrity for him to choose to maintain a dignified silence in the face of such allegations to be one thing

[02:44:11.370 --> 02:44:14.910]
But for him to actively deny the allegations raises the Gary Hart question

[02:44:14.910 --> 02:44:17.770]
Is this candidate honest or a blatant liar and hypocrite?

[02:44:18.030 --> 02:44:19.810]
So, Memo to Florida editors and reporters

[02:44:19.810 --> 02:44:23.870]
You have a professional obligation report on stories that have a bearing on the truthfulness

[02:44:23.870 --> 02:44:26.850]
And take what he and ethics to those running for the highest office in your state

[02:44:26.850 --> 02:44:30.910]
If politicians may claim about their lives and backgrounds that you have reasonably maybe false

[02:44:30.910 --> 02:44:34.410]
You have a duty to report that to investigate it and lay the results before the voters

[02:44:34.410 --> 02:44:37.490]
If you don't do that you're simply not doing your job

[02:44:37.490 --> 02:44:39.630]
That's from Gabriel Wartell on the Huffington Post

[02:44:41.870 --> 02:44:42.750]
Got it?

[02:44:42.790 --> 02:44:43.770]
Got it?

[02:44:43.790 --> 02:44:46.730]
That's for a Rodrigo who's like all been under shape

[02:44:46.730 --> 02:44:48.090]
All would feel better now

[02:44:48.090 --> 02:44:50.150]
You feel better about Rodrigo and it's not too bad

[02:44:50.770 --> 02:44:54.690]
Okay, so here's that thing hacking democracy is the name of this HBO documentary

[02:44:54.690 --> 02:44:55.690]
Are you hacking some?

[02:44:55.690 --> 02:44:56.790]
Nice to meet you

[02:44:56.790 --> 02:44:57.070]
Good

[02:44:57.670 --> 02:45:00.350]
Is American democracy safe in the age of computers?

[02:45:00.370 --> 02:45:03.070]
This cautionary film looks at the very real risk of hackers

[02:45:03.690 --> 02:45:11.170]
Ordering vote counts in public elections and it's supposed to develop the ability of computers which kind of approximately 80% of America's votes in county, state and federal elections

[02:45:11.170 --> 02:45:13.570]
Oh, not fixed elections in America, that would be a first

[02:45:14.130 --> 02:45:19.190]
Filmed in 2004 and 5, this documentary tells the story of Bev Harris, a Seattle publicist writer

[02:45:19.190 --> 02:45:25.050]
Who's locked up group uncovered evidence of mishandled voting records and suspicious voting machine malfunctions

[02:45:25.550 --> 02:45:30.950]
Harris's crusade took the group consisting of computer experts, activists, and political candidates from both parties

[02:45:30.950 --> 02:45:35.110]
From her home computer where she found a computer system blueprint accidentally made public

[02:45:35.110 --> 02:45:39.590]
To Tallahassee for a mini election that proved just how easy it is to hack the vote

[02:45:39.590 --> 02:45:41.510]
Kind of like hack the wife, remember that?

[02:45:42.030 --> 02:45:42.790]
How could I forget you?

[02:45:42.830 --> 02:45:43.990]
Yeah, I think we got...

[02:45:43.990 --> 02:45:44.550]
Oh yeah, we do

[02:45:45.150 --> 02:45:48.330]
Speaking of OJ, if I'd done it

[02:45:48.910 --> 02:45:52.670]
She's back to town for Texas and for football, for football, for football

[02:45:52.670 --> 02:45:56.310]
So anyway, hacking the micro-season in the HBO documentary

[02:45:56.310 --> 02:45:58.270]
And here's the schedule, it's all over the place

[02:45:58.270 --> 02:46:00.270]
It's on Thursday, Friday, Sunday, Tuesday

[02:46:00.270 --> 02:46:02.650]
November 2nd through the 10th

[02:46:02.650 --> 02:46:05.430]
Which quite frankly, it's on several times before Tuesday

[02:46:05.430 --> 02:46:07.810]
I would recommend if you're going to watch it, if you have HBO

[02:46:08.330 --> 02:46:10.550]
Watch it before Tuesday, before election day would be a good idea

[02:46:10.550 --> 02:46:14.210]
Because it's on two, it's all over the place on Tuesday on Election Day

[02:46:14.210 --> 02:46:16.250]
Interesting, and they have just a coincidence

[02:46:16.250 --> 02:46:20.470]
You know, HBO Latino, East, West, North, South, in the middle, etc

[02:46:20.890 --> 02:46:22.790]
All of these things, all these places

[02:46:23.250 --> 02:46:26.530]
I'll take you one thing, that Roger's chocolate almond brittle sounds really inviting

[02:46:26.530 --> 02:46:27.710]
Thank God I'm not going to get any

[02:46:28.850 --> 02:46:31.330]
Because if I did, and I got my blood sugar weapon will be your fault

[02:46:31.330 --> 02:46:33.370]
You don't want to take the back for that, do you?

[02:46:33.530 --> 02:46:34.870]
No, man, I don't want that blood on my hand

[02:46:34.870 --> 02:46:37.230]
Just remember if I croak for a before my birthday post

[02:46:37.230 --> 02:46:39.350]
George, in spite of that nice gift he sent me

[02:46:39.350 --> 02:46:42.490]
That was just a cover-up, you know, it's just a deflection

[02:46:42.490 --> 02:46:43.730]
You see right through me

[02:46:46.050 --> 02:46:48.270]
1143 votes on a full year, I'm going to do right now

[02:46:48.270 --> 02:46:49.490]
Go principal, watch it

[02:46:49.490 --> 02:46:52.190]
You're going to go put that pasta in there

[02:46:52.190 --> 02:46:54.090]
My stall, I'll pasta, baby, you got it

[02:46:54.090 --> 02:46:56.330]
I'm going to put my big thing right on the stool

[02:46:56.330 --> 02:46:59.990]
I'm going to heat it up and stick my big can right on the stool

[02:46:59.990 --> 02:47:04.350]
The biggest name, sub-best talent, the best is me or Roger

[02:47:04.350 --> 02:47:07.310]
Sports Radio 560, UAM

[02:47:14.250 --> 02:47:17.350]
It's been worth my internship at the URDNC giant now

[02:47:18.510 --> 02:47:21.370]
Well, I'm going to show you what a big ass head I was to year

[02:47:21.370 --> 02:47:22.050]
And how?

[02:47:22.690 --> 02:47:26.030]
You're going to get by somebody good enough to fill my big pants?

[02:47:26.790 --> 02:47:27.730]
Are you easy?

[02:47:28.310 --> 02:47:30.730]
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

[02:47:31.890 --> 02:47:34.070]
Very no chance I'll have to be coming back

[02:47:35.690 --> 02:47:38.230]
I'm trying to consider a little bit counteract

[02:47:39.350 --> 02:47:42.830]
If you want to know what I'm saying, then I'm shutting that transformative down

[02:47:42.830 --> 02:47:44.950]
I wonder why that's easy

[02:47:47.910 --> 02:47:49.510]
I think I'm stupid

[02:47:49.510 --> 02:47:49.630]
I'm stupid

[02:47:51.670 --> 02:47:52.470]
I'm stupid

[02:47:52.470 --> 02:47:53.430]
I'm stupid

[02:47:53.430 --> 02:47:53.850]
I'm stupid

[02:47:53.850 --> 02:47:54.450]
I'm stupid

[02:47:54.450 --> 02:47:56.630]
I'm stupid

[02:47:56.630 --> 02:47:57.410]
I'm stupid

[02:47:57.410 --> 02:47:59.150]
I'm stupid

[02:47:59.150 --> 02:48:03.570]
I'm stupid

[02:48:05.610 --> 02:48:08.990]
I think your old dreams weren't only got you today

[02:48:08.990 --> 02:48:13.370]
I said my ratings have gone about in this game

[02:48:13.370 --> 02:48:18.030]
But radio has already gone for the giant number one

[02:48:18.030 --> 02:48:20.930]
And we did

[02:48:22.830 --> 02:48:25.110]
Roger, we just know

[02:48:25.110 --> 02:48:26.810]
Now take it

[02:48:26.810 --> 02:48:29.770]
Roger, we just know

[02:48:29.770 --> 02:48:31.990]
We just know

[02:48:31.990 --> 02:48:36.450]
We just know

[02:48:36.450 --> 02:48:38.910]
Roger, we just know

[02:48:38.910 --> 02:48:41.390]
You'll fight away something

[02:48:41.910 --> 02:48:43.570]
And then call me and give me a slap

[02:48:43.570 --> 02:48:44.290]
You see, go

[02:48:45.430 --> 02:48:47.290]
Where are you going to go fight me?

[02:48:47.470 --> 02:48:48.650]
You like a guy?

[02:48:49.330 --> 02:48:51.910]
I'm not allowed to, I knew that

[02:48:54.930 --> 02:48:58.750]
Abdul, Abdul, Abdul, Abdul, Abdul, Abdul, Abdul, Abdul. Abdul, Abdul, Abdul, Abdul, Abdul.

[02:48:59.150 --> 02:49:02.070]
Let's up you some more prisoners

[02:49:02.070 --> 02:49:05.710]
Oh, make them scream nice and loud

[02:49:05.710 --> 02:49:06.090]
Yes

[02:49:06.090 --> 02:49:09.250]
Get me some wires and a fat tree.

[02:49:09.510 --> 02:49:10.090]
Paddy, Fer.

[02:49:10.370 --> 02:49:14.590]
I don't care if they eat from my rack to the ears.

[02:49:14.790 --> 02:49:16.850]
Use you to the torture.

[02:49:17.530 --> 02:49:20.210]
Cause they're just lame, they're game.

[02:49:20.910 --> 02:49:27.290]
In the past, it had to be worse with the dumb who say.

[02:49:28.030 --> 02:49:29.010]
Oh, my, my, my!
