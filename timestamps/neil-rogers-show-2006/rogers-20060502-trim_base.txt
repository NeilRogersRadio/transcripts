[00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:09.560]
There's that echo again. Oh God. What's the use? I

[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.100]
said it hurts. It's not going to win a Kentucky Derby. Who's that?

[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.680]
With a city. Yeah, died. The ceased.

[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.900]
Die a couple weeks ago. Yeah. I

[00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.060]
I bet a lot of horses like that only usually they die about 100 yards from the wire.

[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.980]
I did his race 21 now. The lanes and stakes. Really? Yep. Well, I guess a little bit

[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.320]
everybody was celebrating because you know that was the race that got his picket

[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.280]
punch to the derby. Well, guess what? Unlikely. Yep. Well, I'm looking at this stuff.

[00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.480]
I just printed out for Friday off the trail all these horses that are injured or

[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.520]
unlikely. And then next to his name, it says deceased. Yes, it's you can't get

[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.120]
more unlikely than that. No. Who else are they saying is unlikely? Don of war.

[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.900]
Who? Your buddy Nick Zito's great point. Those horses are out of it with high

[00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.040]
cotton. Well, listen, off the trail. In other words, these are not going to be in.

[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.320]
Yeah. Red Raymond, but this was going back some time ago. Don't understand. Super

[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.700]
fly another Nick Zito horse and want to run her. That's real old information.

[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.300]
Well, that's what I'm telling you. Yeah. Now, would I be safe in picking a brother

[00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.480]
Derek? I don't know about brother Derek. He's there's a lot of speed in the race.

[00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.040]
And you know, he could get caught up in that. Alex Solis. My good buddy Alex Alex is

[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.640]
good. Well, there you go. Like I said, there's a lot of speed in the race. Alex, by

[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.860]
the way, has had some back problems in the last few months. He's not as right and

[00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.160]
good though. I just saw him at Hollywood Park with your buddy calling the races

[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.720]
there. Vick Stofras frozen dinners. I was just launching yesterday as a matter of

[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.760]
fact. He's come back good. How about private vow with Sean Bridgeman? He's another

[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.320]
another speed horse trained by Steve Asmison. He's got to be related. How is he

[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.760]
related to Cass Asmison? They are related. I think of course. I know their brothers, I think.

[00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.220]
Are they? Yeah. He was a great Jackie. Yep. Went to Europe. He went off to France and

[00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.460]
Steve Cawthon went off to England and developed that real heavy British accent. He did.

[00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.380]
Steve Cawthon has a British accent now. Yeah. I had him on the show a couple years

[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.700]
ago. He didn't have an accent. Well, maybe he lost it. But boy, when he was riding

[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.980]
over there, I saw him interviewed on TV over there that we were watching the races.

[00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.280]
Man, he developed a real heavy British accent. Yeah. He came back and lost it. Well,

[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.160]
probably went back to New York and lost it. He's in Kentucky. That is where he belongs.

[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.400]
That's where he's from. Yes, it is. So you're going to have Dave on the show Friday?

[00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.060]
Friday, yeah. I'm not going to let you talk me off, brother Derek. I'm going to do a little

[00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.840]
more research. I did just 10 seconds ago. I just printed this stuff out. It's starting

[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.300]
to do my homework. I don't pay any attention to those Chinatown horses, those thoroughbreds.

[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.780]
You know, I don't pay too much attention. They come out and they like, oh, don't run

[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.860]
too fast now. I don't get all whipped up before the race. I think I don't understand.

[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.760]
I can understand two-year-olds that won't go in the starting gate. You know, they're

[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.240]
like freaked out. But when you have age toruses that go to the gate, wow, I mean, how stupid

[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.280]
do you have to be? How many times do you have to go in the damn starting gate before they

[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.100]
have to pochky around and screw around? Go in the gate already and cut the crap. I hate

[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.180]
that. Take some, take some, take some, a lot of races and I'm sure you agree with this.

[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.820]
It takes them longer to load the gate than visit around the race. Yeah, that's true.

[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.780]
Not just with young horses, like you say. You know, the thing with Brother Derek is that

[00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.760]
he's been running in California and he's been running against four and five horse fields.

[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.120]
Yeah. And now he's going to get up against the, you know, a big deal with a lot of people.

[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.860]
The name Derek, our close friend Derek, was a real degenerate gambler and Alex Salise.

[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.740]
I mean, it's a good combination, but I haven't even looked at the end of lines yet.

[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.760]
Okay. He's going to be the favorite brother there. Is he really? Yeah.

[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.540]
Well, how do you like that? See, all I got to do is mention him and I'll wrap the

[00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.660]
buddy's sweet of five. There he is. He just drives. I mean, it's just great expertise in the matter.

[00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.620]
I was watching they have, uh, and would find two four long races, quarter of a mile.

[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.300]
Yeah, for babies. Yeah. And there was a horse broke the track record 21 and two.

[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.180]
I think it was Monday, 21 and two. They used to run those a high alleo all the time.

[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.080]
I mean, that's just a joke. You go to the window and you come back.

[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.840]
Oh, you can meet that races long over. Forget about that.

[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.320]
It's like, you know, like you say, it's like a turtle horse racing.

[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.100]
Yep. I don't know if you remember, but several years, many years ago,

[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.300]
they tried quarter horse racing, a couple of years of pompadome.

[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.720]
Yeah, I remember what I went over like the Marlins.

[00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.740]
The Marlins. Yeah, they had announced crowd of 6,017 yesterday.

[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.500]
That's announced crowd. Yeah, with me.

[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.960]
Wow, we got a draw pitch last night. They could have had that.

[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:31.580]
I beg your pardon?

[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.720]
That's our willless pitch. I understand. Oh, that had any blue. The game.

[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.580]
I saw a little bit of it. But I'm telling you they had 6,017.

[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.260]
Yeah. So that means they had only two or three thousand when Dom 12 was

[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.240]
pitching. So what's going to happen when I'm short speeches?

[00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.680]
You will find out. And you never did find out who Gary Cohn was.

[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.100]
Did you? No. I don't. I just don't know what to do about this.

[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.040]
You think I made that up, don't you?

[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.740]
I was a jockey at Calder. In fact, and then he became a Jock's agent.

[00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.580]
He got injured and then he became an agent.

[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.520]
If you talk to your good post-friend Phil Salzman about it,

[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.100]
he'll remember Gary Cohn. Good Jewish boy. One of the few.

[00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.900]
I just don't remember him. Well, how many years ago was it?

[00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.900]
Oh, that's a long time ago. Way back, maybe 20 some.

[00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.020]
Back in the days of Julio Pazua.

[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.100]
Oh, I remember him.

[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.620]
And Jorge Duarte, real stiff. I mean, real great writer.

[00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.340]
And Jacinto Vazquez was in Florida at that time in the latter days of his

[00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.260]
checkered career.

[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.080]
Oh, Jacinto Naly's up in O'Calla.

[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.440]
Yeah. Good place for you, Jacinto. You stiff.

[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.200]
Well, I hated him, man. I didn't like him at all.

[00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.860]
I'm telling you, another guy that came down to highly one year and just couldn't.

[00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.240]
He couldn't. He needed a compass in the road map and I was Richard Migliori, man.

[00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.960]
What are we talking horse racing here? That's because the Derby's coming up front.

[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.560]
Yeah, well, I'm I'm not here.

[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.300]
It's just awful.

[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.840]
Your potential new neighbor up there. Who's that?

[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.540]
Ricky Williams.

[00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.160]
No, he's not coming here. His contract with it often says he can't leave.

[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.280]
He can't go to another league. He can go to Canada.

[00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.320]
He can't play in another league. I'm telling you that right now.

[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.000]
He cannot, if they're unless they let him out.

[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.400]
I think he and saving their very.

[00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.800]
They're very nervous about having him come here because he's going to the weed supply.

[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.840]
I'm going on about 40% of he comes here.

[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.300]
I'm not sure what his contract with the dolphins is at this point.

[00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.160]
I'm telling you, I read him. I was in there all over it here in the newspapers here.

[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.520]
Two days ago, I read that his contract with the dolphins stipulates specifically

[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.580]
that he can't play in another league without the permission of the dolphin.

[00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.100]
Well, there's a story today that they are talking about it.

[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.420]
About what? Him coming here?

[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.700]
Yeah.

[00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.360]
Oh, we don't want him here. Jesus God.

[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.580]
He could neighbor for you.

[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.140]
No, he would not be a good neighbor.

[00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.360]
He goes to the neighborhood.

[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.940]
Ricky Williams for Christ's sakes.

[00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.480]
Man, next thing be OJ be coming up here.

[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.520]
You were my first thought when I saw that.

[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.860]
Then, of course, I see this thing with Shaq and Kobe and her babies were born like six minutes apart.

[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:45.900]
Shaq!

[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.140]
Yeah, I don't think there's any coincidence there.

[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.600]
I was asking George before to show how they got Shaq's baby out of his wife's womb.

[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.720]
You know, any baby that's got a head, you know, six sizes normal.

[00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.860]
Or a bowling ball.

[00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.340]
How do they get that thing?

[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.380]
I'm probably with a shoehorn and a crane.

[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.060]
So the book comes out today?

[00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:04.780]
Yeah.

[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.760]
Well, I'm so glad you mentioned that.

[00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.020]
Yeah, me too.

[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.080]
Yeah, just keep talking.

[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.300]
It comes out at 11.30.

[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.860]
I believe. Just keep going to 11.30.

[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:12.380]
Okay.

[00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.840]
So you will have all the results.

[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.520]
I'm sure.

[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:16.400]
What?

[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.700]
You will have all the results.

[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.560]
I have all the results.

[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.420]
I have. I'm sitting on eggshells on this one.

[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.700]
I think it's going to be really something.

[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:24.820]
I can't say the word on it.

[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.720]
I'll get joyous, but I think it's going to be really something.

[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.400]
Like disaster, you mean?

[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.700]
Well, this new regime we got, man.

[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.280]
They just seem, I don't know, in suspended animation.

[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.060]
They're like your buddy, Larry King, they're in suspended animation.

[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.100]
I don't know what to all they're thinking about.

[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.660]
They just can't get off the dime.

[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.740]
And then two to four, we got that.

[00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.500]
And we have bow today.

[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.820]
Thank God, a little variety.

[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.880]
By the way, Cop just gave me a note here.

[00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.440]
Permanently disabled, jockey-guild members.

[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:53.540]
Gary Cohen is one of them.

[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:54.360]
I told you.

[00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:55.260]
What did I tell you?

[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.700]
He got injured.

[00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.380]
And then he became a jockey-sage and he was a pretty good rider.

[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.080]
I don't know about that David Cohen, whether he's related,

[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.260]
and the one in Verizon, California, you know who he is.

[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.220]
David Cohen.

[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:05.720]
Yeah.

[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.340]
I know who he is.

[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.180]
He's not very good.

[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.340]
I'll tell you, he's pretty good as Gary Gomez.

[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.300]
Oh, Gary Gomez is a great friend of mine as an agent.

[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.440]
And he's going to be riding Ron and John.

[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.260]
And which is one of the...

[00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:17.720]
Ron St. John?

[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:18.580]
Yeah, and one of the great...

[00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.600]
Gary Gomez is going to be riding Ron St. John of Derby folks.

[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.240]
One of the three entries from Bob Baffert.

[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.420]
And I know that they wanted very much to ride that horse.

[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:28.080]
Yeah.

[00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.020]
He lobbied Baffert to get them out.

[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.900]
And that was the one he chose.

[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.400]
I see that flashing a pantowler base.

[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.140]
He can't find a finish line with a compass.

[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:36.560]
No.

[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.900]
Gomez is moving east, by the way.

[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:39.420]
What is?

[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:40.260]
Gary Gomez.

[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.700]
He's moving to the east coast.

[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:42.420]
Yeah.

[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.580]
He's going to ride in New York for Todd Plessier.

[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.600]
And Rafael de Harrono doesn't have a mountain to Derby, I don't think.

[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:48.780]
I don't think he does either.

[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.140]
I told you he's a damn good jockey.

[00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:50.760]
He's very good.

[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:50.860]
He didn't bring me.

[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.400]
He said he ran all those crappy tracks and Kentucky.

[00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:54.480]
It's pretty good.

[00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:55.500]
He's terrific.

[00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.240]
We need Frankie Dittory over here.

[00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.320]
That's what we need in the Derby.

[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.720]
Yeah, but he's going the wrong way, baby.

[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:02.860]
Frankie Dittory.

[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.120]
And I just love what he jumps off the horse there in the winter circle.

[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.680]
You know, after he puts on a great show.

[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:08.960]
Probably a year for a year.

[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:09.960]
He almost got killed.

[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.180]
That's not that many years ago.

[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:11.720]
And a helicopter.

[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.100]
It'll probably be here for the audience in a million.

[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:14.780]
Do you remember that?

[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.140]
I was in Europe at the time.

[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.020]
He damn near got killed.

[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.160]
There was a helicopter crashed.

[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.940]
They were transporting him to a four ride in one particular race.

[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:21.660]
I forget where it was.

[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:22.200]
I think in Italy.

[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.220]
And the helicopter crashed in the infield.

[00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:25.340]
He damn near got killed.

[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.960]
No trivia there for you.

[00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:27.880]
Yeah, that's a good one.

[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.200]
Land Frank Dittory.

[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:30.360]
He's great.

[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.440]
Something about European racing, man.

[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:33.320]
I don't know.

[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.060]
I can't describe it.

[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.940]
I've watched a lot of it when I was over there on the satellite.

[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.860]
Yeah, there's kind of an elegance to it.

[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:39.900]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.540]
Well, you know you were over there for the Ascot.

[00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.480]
There's just a whole different ambiance to it.

[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:45.120]
I'd like to go to the Yark sometime.

[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:46.440]
It's supposed to be fancy.

[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.220]
The Arctitron.

[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:47.800]
Yes.

[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.040]
And then in France, they got that.

[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.560]
They got the most...

[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.880]
I talked to Dave about this.

[00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:53.920]
I don't think I ever mentioned it to you.

[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.660]
They got harness under saddle.

[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.460]
Have you ever seen that?

[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.000]
No.

[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.600]
They've got trotters who they trot, but they have jockeys on.

[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.600]
It's the funniest thing to watch.

[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:03.260]
It's a panic.

[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.120]
And the jockeys don't carry a whip.

[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.800]
And they just kind of like, you know, urge the horse along.

[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.000]
It's just...it's really funny to watch.

[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.660]
I think it was not funny to watch.

[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:12.300]
It's old in them.

[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.200]
People chase races.

[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.780]
They got over there where the horses are like...

[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.040]
Like by the end of the race, they had four of them to have to be destroyed.

[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.120]
I don't know...in England.

[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.000]
I don't know what that's all about.

[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.260]
They still do that too.

[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.880]
I guess they probably use a lot of horse meat.

[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.080]
Oh, and I'll tell you one other thing.

[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.320]
By the way, they ask people chase racing at Saratoga.

[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:29.580]
One thing I was thinking about the other day, years ago,

[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.120]
remember when the dog tracks used to really pack them in

[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.540]
and they had a matinee in the record.

[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.560]
They had a lot of them in the box.

[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.760]
They used to have hurdle races at the dog tracks in Florida.

[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.620]
And they had...they were like...the best way I can describe it,

[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.080]
they were like upside down brooms, you know,

[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.780]
with like a brushes at the top.

[00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:44.740]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:45.180]
Yeah.

[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:45.960]
Hard to describe it.

[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.520]
And the dogs would jump over those brooms.

[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:49.960]
They were hurdles for dog.

[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:50.720]
It was really something.

[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.320]
But that's another era, man.

[00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.380]
That's when the dog...I'm sure Ken probably remembers that.

[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:54.900]
Yeah, he must.

[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.020]
We were talking about the days when we used to go to the Miami Beach

[00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:58.560]
Count Club.

[00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.120]
Remember that?

[00:10:59.220 --> 00:10:59.640]
Yeah, sure.

[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:00.920]
I'm right for the Photoshop Beach.

[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:01.540]
I've been there.

[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.060]
I was at the one in Saratoga.

[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:06.740]
I mentioned yesterday my first trip to the dog track,

[00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.620]
1950, and that maybe was 1968.

[00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.260]
I was visiting Fort Lauderdum on vacation.

[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.120]
And I went to Flagler with a friend of mine.

[00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.880]
I won 700 bucks the first night of the dogs.

[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:17.940]
I had no idea what I was doing.

[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.240]
I thought, boy, this is a piece of cake.

[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.220]
This is better than the horses.

[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.080]
And the second night we went back,

[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:26.320]
and I bet 100 to win and 100 to place out of the dog

[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.740]
when they came out of the box.

[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.140]
Another dog ran into him.

[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.180]
He went flying up out of the air and came flopping down on the track

[00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:32.980]
and just lay there.

[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.880]
I'm screaming, there's my 200 bucks on the track.

[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:36.980]
Get up, you piece of crap.

[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.120]
That's the only thing that's...

[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.500]
And I've also seen pictures.

[00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.400]
Now, this has got to be before even we were born.

[00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:43.700]
Old fossils like us.

[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.660]
But they had monkeys on the backs of the dogs.

[00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:47.400]
Did you ever see that?

[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:47.680]
No.

[00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:48.360]
Yes.

[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.800]
Ask him about that.

[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.780]
I mean, I'm sure we'd ever had it down there.

[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.920]
But once upon a time, I think in the early part of the last century,

[00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.420]
they had monkeys riding the dogs in dog races.

[00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:58.080]
Where is Ken?

[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.340]
I'm sure he is.

[00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:02.340]
I think he would know about it.

[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.080]
I've seen it.

[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.320]
I've seen it in film footage of it.

[00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:05.580]
Yeah.

[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.680]
They're like to put some monkeys on the top of it.

[00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.060]
Yeah, little tiny monkeys riding the dogs.

[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:11.360]
Monkey jockeys.

[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:12.380]
Oh, is he?

[00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:13.160]
If you ever watch that,

[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.260]
number one happened to Cosell,

[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.560]
that little monkey Alvin Garrett.

[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.440]
Don't start with it.

[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.100]
Don't go there.

[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.000]
Not going there.

[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:19.500]
No.

[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.920]
Don't start with those Gary Bane comments.

[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.400]
Well, listen on that note.

[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:24.900]
Yeah.

[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.520]
It's already time for our first break.

[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.460]
I'm off for Kentucky.

[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.440]
Now, what are we going to be doing the rest of the week?

[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.780]
You're not doing any more shows this week?

[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.020]
No, I've got to work up there.

[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.580]
You know what I'm going to do?

[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.720]
Because I'm pretty much over the floors that my ears aren't open.

[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.660]
Don't you hate that when your ears are plugged up

[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:43.600]
and you're like, you're...

[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.520]
Especially when you have to fly.

[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.420]
I think that would help though.

[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:47.700]
I've got to go catch a plane.

[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:48.440]
I'll see you.

[00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.800]
No, I mean, that's the only thing my ears would open up tomorrow.

[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:52.720]
I'd go out to Woodbine.

[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.920]
I think the sound of the machines might open up my ears tomorrow.

[00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:57.020]
I'm going to give it a shot anyway.

[00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:00.020]
Anyway, yeah, I've got a draw show tomorrow afternoon.

[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:05.200]
And then Friday, I got the handicap for show in the morning.

[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:06.960]
Tomorrow morning, I got to do sports.

[00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:08.980]
Or, once Thursday, sports center,

[00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:10.920]
I got about nine shows to do up there.

[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:11.960]
So...

[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.440]
So, now there is the ratings are coming out.

[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.360]
Now, what times are you flight?

[00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:15.700]
1215.

[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:20.220]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.360]
The ratings are coming out at 1130.

[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.520]
Hey, sleep and tell it noon.

[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:24.180]
Excellent.

[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:24.600]
Yes.

[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:29.160]
By the way, Beast just brought me monkey riding on a grayhound

[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.080]
a picture of this.

[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.440]
So, you have a couple of low times, September 15, 1935.

[00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:35.920]
I told you.

[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.460]
I wasn't around then.

[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.360]
No, I said before we were born in this.

[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:39.920]
Oh, okay.

[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.100]
Long ago.

[00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:42.200]
It's a great picture.

[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:47.320]
Yeah, and that isn't that a funny looking thing. We're gonna have Dossle the gray hand is yeah

[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:53.100]
Well, maybe that's what we can do maybe we can get the monkey off our back. We'll see let's hope cross your legs

[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.000]
I'll talk him Monday and have a safe trip. Thanks

[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000]
The music

[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.040]
Express on the previous programs are those of the hosts guests and collars and you're not

[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:01.760]
solid

[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.280]
Maybe a plunge would open my eyes

[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.140]
Thanks, you wish right then take a look

[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:15.280]
Thank you, I'm excited ahead on that kid's round

[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.940]
Were you crushed back in

[00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:25.580]
Hey everybody, I'm brown and brown accountable for everybody brown and brown

[00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:32.340]
That's a human being I'm a thinker's appointment, but I got a brown nose and I know where I'm pointing

[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:36.820]
There was no rules to get them say they don't vote

[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:38.460]
highway

[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.540]
Possibly can show my so

[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:44.880]
Phoenix

[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:14.460]
I did one heck of a job and it sure pays off to be a crowning and another white maize.

[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:19.240]
The Christian founding, the National Guard, is down then now.

[00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:24.420]
With orders just to get the press out of town, everybody go home.

[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:25.880]
There's nothing to see.

[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:34.800]
Everything here is picture-pain over hurricane gave us the big EC for the Eoconsumcial

[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.800]
and to be like a giant republic in Swain G.

[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:42.680]
Praise Jesus for our Lord and King.

[00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:46.020]
Praise Jesus for our Lord and King.

[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.420]
I don't believe compassion is what we're like.

[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:56.180]
It serves the right to have less class and you descend to say it's a national disgrace

[00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:57.920]
that you'd rather lie.

[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:02.860]
In the first place, this is no time to play the blame game.

[00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:06.240]
Since we know that furry things are caused by babies,

[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:12.740]
who are not the right God of all might stride him with their land and carols grow.

[00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:16.180]
Oh, we're achieving the America's right wing dream.

[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:22.420]
To make everybody like like these and their ignorance of a big.

[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:29.740]
Who gets his job from ocean of rich poor, how I miss heading back to a rainy and horses.

[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:36.100]
I'd rather do that as watch floating orcs is on the negligent vertebra now.

[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.740]
And I'll keep going down to keep finals ground.

[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.640]
I'm a negligent vertebra now.

[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:46.480]
But I'll keep going down to keep finals ground.

[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.240]
I was thinking of those funky dog races with a mucky's on the back.

[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.900]
You know that they have camel racing in the middle.

[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.140]
Do we ever see that?

[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:53.980]
Right, yes I have.

[00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:55.360]
Well, it's really something alive.

[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.820]
But yeah, it is something to watch.

[00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:00.480]
And they keep whipping on those poor damn things and whipping on them and beating on them.

[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.060]
Reminds me the camel at the die.

[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.780]
It was frothing at the mouth in that movie with Willie Ames.

[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:05.220]
Paradise.

[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:05.860]
Right.

[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:06.200]

[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:06.800]
Yes, I do.

[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.740]
Who was he a chicken at 20 times PB Cates?

[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.320]
No, PB Cates was in there.

[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.660]
She was voyish in Goyish.

[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.100]
That's what somebody said.

[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.040]
According to the turd, 10, 17 boy, look at this.

[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.680]
It's already time almost for the second break.

[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.220]
That's okay.

[00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:23.000]
We're just here to kill an hour and a half until those ratings come out at 11, 30 this morning.

[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.800]
Boy, this is the day that a lot of people come inside the building.

[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.220]
Around the building, around the hood.

[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.200]
They're all like doing a green-ackle, aqua-quicks, a quip-stack.

[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:32.920]
Oh, oh.

[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:36.480]
Hey, you know, sometimes it's the things you can't see that can really be bad for you.

Log on to dryconcepts.com.

[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.960]
This is Neil Rogers.

[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:50.420]
This is 5.69-8-10.

[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.820]
You call that a consultant?

[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:59.720]
For the white house image is rightful, and the wee behind is rightful.

[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.320]
Two cadences left, folds aren't low.

[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:05.340]
Tony's known, Tony's known, Tony's known.

[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.460]
Over top show host is shopping.

[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.440]
So the reds are red, he's stopping.

[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.300]
When you want your leadership to blow.

[00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:17.420]
Tony's known, Tony's known, he's your home.

[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:20.640]
He will totally hold bush ties.

[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:23.300]
Though he's called him that name before.

[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.680]
But if you need a medal in Tardrines.

[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.320]
Tony's known, he's your home.

[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:32.580]
Oh, bush thinks he'll be superlative.

[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.420]
And his views are quite conservative.

[00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:38.320]
Smart look, I hear him, we don't know.

[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.340]
Tony's known, Tony's known, Tony's known.

[00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.520]
I just looked at the past performance lines at Brother Derek Online.

[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.540]
He didn't have to have a lead.

[00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:46.580]
He can race from off the pace.

[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:47.640]
I'm sticking with Brother Derek.

[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.580]
Don't let anybody talk to me often, okay?

[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:50.440]
Okay.

[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.160]
I'm just telling you that right now.

[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.880]
He's going to win the... he's a monster, man.

[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:54.640]
He's a monster.

[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:55.740]
You ever see a monster?

[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:56.820]
Every day.

[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:57.380]
How do you like that?

[00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.700]
That Hank is bailing out at 12.15 and the ratings are coming in 11.30,

[00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:02.580]
which means we ought to have money around new-ish.

[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:04.160]
So he's flying hell out.

[00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:05.640]
Man, good choice.

[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.420]
Here's the poll result from yesterday.

[00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:13.800]
The star-spangled banner should be sung in English only, 882, 58.1%.

[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.300]
You know my comment on the whole thing, this should be our biggest problem.

[00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:16.740]
Oh, yeah.

[00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:18.780]
This should be your biggest problem.

[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:22.860]
I bet you there's a fact coming, because I can actually hear the fact sound coming out there.

[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:23.300]
There we go.

[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:24.060]
The fact coming, yes.

[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.920]
Yeah, but I hear the fact sound coming on your end.

[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.160]
Well, at least to come here.

[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.180]
And with my ears plugged up, it goes to show you something.

[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:30.720]
Huh?

[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.920]
I can't wait to hear these great calls we're going to get today.

[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:34.740]
I know it's not going to be nearly as good as yesterday.

[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:36.000]
But it's Tuesday.

[00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:37.940]
Tuesday's kind of like one of those in-between days.

[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:39.680]
It's not fish and it's not foul.

[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.200]
English only 882.

[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.300]
Who gives a Schmidt?

[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:42.920]
256.

[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:43.740]
Amen.

[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.600]
Boy, crap that people get all whipped up about.

[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.240]
It should be sung rarely.

[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.300]
It's a bad song, 190.

[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:51.540]
Amen to that too.

[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:53.760]
In any language, 159.

[00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:57.200]
In English or Spanish only, uh, D.C. Ocho.

[00:20:58.260 --> 00:20:58.720]
18.

[00:20:59.080 --> 00:20:59.740]
Very good.

[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:00.320]
What?

[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.000]
Hey, I know my numbers, Mr. Spanish and Tadiano.

[00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:04.180]
I know my numbers.

[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:04.960]
That's right.

[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:05.900]
Saturday, Monday.

[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.300]
And I hate to just pull only 11.

[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:08.800]
Onc.

[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:14.080]
Let's see, here's the fact you just sent from Phil and Gainesville for their poll.

[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:15.860]
How did legal day affect me?

[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.260]
Yes, I'm not calling it immigrant day because it wasn't immigrant day.

[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.560]
It wasn't the day without immigrants.

[00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.900]
It was the day without illegal aliens, man.

[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:23.400]
Right.

[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.860]
And your boy, Lou Dobbs, he was going a Schmidt on last night.

[00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:27.560]
Only you?

[00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:28.120]
And Lou.

[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:33.720]
I even got a column on here that he wrote a, uh, you wrote a Comprehensive and he was on with your buddy Larry last night.

[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:38.800]
You know, it's just I want, I went to a pro immigrant rally.

[00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:40.320]
It's not a pro immigrant rally.

[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:42.060]
It's pro illegal alien rally.

[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:42.900]
Okay, get it right.

[00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:43.700]
More or less.

[00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:46.580]
Seven million undocumented workers do the work many citizens refuse to do.

[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.240]
They deserve a shot of becoming legal.

[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:49.440]
Oh, yeah.

[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:50.100]
They're shot.

[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:50.720]
Yeah.

[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.400]
Well, what a crock that is.

[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:52.620]
Yeah.

[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:53.820]
So business they do work that.

[00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:58.500]
What they do is they create the help to keep the minimum wage as low as possible.

[00:21:58.720 --> 00:21:58.980]
Mm-hmm.

[00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:03.380]
They're, they help the grave robbing big corporations and it's all a scam.

[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.740]
That's always the cover up for coming in legally.

[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:11.040]
All they're doing jobs that other people are going to do, bull crap, that other people aren't going to do at slave wages.

[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:11.660]
That's right.

[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:12.100]

[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:12.520]

[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:20.000]
And if anybody wants to know why those people are pouring across here and don't let those Mexican chamber of commerce types fool you on these talking head shows,

[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.460]
the conditions in Mexico are deplorable.

[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.340]
In fact, the conditions in most of Latin America are deplorable.

[00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:30.380]
And these people are reproducing like rabbits and they got all these unwanted kids running around.

[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:35.520]
Under the age of like 15, running around with no jobs, with no education, with no nothing,

[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:35.900]
right?

[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.400]
Sleppers. In fact, you know something?

[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:38.100]
Sleppers.

[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:38.820]
Yeah.

[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.500]
That's the word that sums it up.

[00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:42.860]
And that's why they're pouring across the border.

[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:48.020]
So instead of like, you know, all this BS, what they ought to do is be having a protest in Mexico.

[00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:50.340]
Of course, they'll probably shoot them all, but that's another story.

[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:50.640]
Right.

[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:55.200]
Here's the fact that it says these people are protesting the yesterday should protest once a week.

[00:22:55.380 --> 00:23:00.820]
What a pleasure it is to shop and get around town and homestead with everyone staying out of the stores.

[00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:03.620]
Oh, it's from Stuttering Gil.

[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.620]
Now that a fact from Stuttering Gil in a long time.

[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.120]
Remember Stuttering Gil?

[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:08.380]
Sure.

[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:09.800]
Wow, that's exciting.

[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:15.080]
Well, wait, we'll hold off today's pool here for just a second or two, which has to do with the crap yesterday.

[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.440]
That's that fact from this guy in Gaines.

[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:18.640]
But who the hell are you, kid man?

[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.500]
They deserve a shot of becoming illegal.

[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:21.180]
You know something?

[00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.980]
Well, let him go through the process, which is what immigrants really do.

[00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:25.940]
Let him live up to the definition of immigrant.

[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:29.600]
Immigrant isn't somebody who sneaks in across the border and comes in illegal.

[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:33.940]
Okay, and works undocumented and gets hired by bunch of grave robbers to work for slave wages.

[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.020]
That's not immigrant.

[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.060]
Okay. That's called illegal alien.

[00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:38.560]
Right. That's an invader.

[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.120]
And whatever happened to poor little alienito anyway.

[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.920]
I think the abueless may have squeezed a little bit too hard.

[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:46.800]
27 past 10 a.k.a.m.

[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.140]
Finally, a TV experience like no other.

[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:53.240]
Comcast, digital cable with on demand is easy to use, has lots to love.

[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:56.340]
And today you can try it for only $34.99 a month for three months.

[00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:58.060]
Why is TV so much better with on demand?

[00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:02.660]
I'm glad you asked, because for starters, you can watch a wide variety of movies and shows whenever you want.

[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:04.760]
It's a revolutionary new way to enjoy TV.

[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:08.520]
On demand is a library of thousands of programs where you start when you say so.

[00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:13.360]
With programming, including free movies, kids show his music videos, cooking shows, sports, home improvement shows,

[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:18.120]
guitar lessons, and so much more, you'll always have something good to watch right when you want to watch it.

[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.560]
And let's not forget about control either with on demand.

[00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:22.540]
You can start it. You can stop it. You can pause it.

[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.540]
Rewind it fast forward programs using your remote.

[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:26.360]
You can't get all these things with satellite.

[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:30.300]
With up to 250 channels plus on demand, you can build your own TV schedule.

[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.180]
Who could possibly ask for more.

[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:35.340]
And best of all, on demand is free with Comcast, digital cable.

[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:38.420]
So pick your showtime, sit back and you wonder how ever lived without it.

[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:43.340]
Call today order Comcast, digital cable and HBO or the power of on demand for just $34.99.

[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:50.620]
A month for three months, invade call 305 Comcast or in sensational call 954 Comcast.

[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:56.900]
This is Neil Rogers. This is 5.62 A.

[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:00.020]
Then Neil Rogers.

[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:09.600]
Sometimes I believe trust is more or less a fairy tale.

[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:15.600]
Seems like someone in CIA put the person in the United States on the spot.

[00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:19.760]
Well, the information escaping.

[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.780]
And that embarrasses me.

[00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:27.260]
And I'm going to ask for the truth from the people who work on my team.

[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:32.960]
And now I have to face the fears of big leaker.

[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.060]
We'll track and we'll try.

[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.120]
And it'll take some time.

[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.600]
And in the final outcome, you can be sure.

[00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:44.780]
There's a big leaker.

[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.240]
That big leaker.

[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:47.420]
Working aside.

[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.320]
Also speaking of the Marlins.

[00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:58.940]
Friends in that long shot.

[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:00.760]
So that must be the issue.

[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.720]
Maybe remember it was the fact that he were playing a big game last night.

[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.120]
Of course, he didn't play last night.

[00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:10.240]
Or maybe the fact that everyone would stay at home and watch the Detroit Edmonton hockey.

[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:11.360]
The chase after.

[00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:20.220]
Edmonton kicked the choice.

[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.320]
Right there in Edmonton, 4-3 last night.

[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:23.940]
That third period was sensational.

[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:26.740]
It was a thing of beauty and joy to my heart.

[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:31.300]
And all of you phony Red Wing fans in South Florida put on the Red Wing jerseys several years ago.

[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:32.800]
And they were like, oh, I have to detour one, two Stanley cups.

[00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:33.760]
Oh, we're all big red.

[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.100]
We air so full of crap.

[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.360]
You wouldn't know Detroit from Iskriming Michigan.

[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.200]
Okay. What a joke.

[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:40.140]
In any rate.

[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.820]
So what was the issue of 6,017?

[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.840]
And like Hank said, Don Trub was pretty much alive tonight.

[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:46.020]
So that's supposed to be the big attraction.

[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:48.160]
Isn't it? That is the big attraction.

[00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:50.240]
In fact, that's the only attraction.

[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:53.880]
Here's the fact that it says that people want us to see if they would have illegals.

[00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:54.600]
I'm all for it.

[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:59.440]
Let's see our schools with less crowded classrooms because of the illegals and new textbooks and higher paid teachers.

[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:03.240]
Thanks to the extra money we'd be saving but not having the waste of educated illegals.

[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:04.580]
There you go. But we demand.

[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:05.380]
We demand.

[00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:05.760]
We demand.

[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:06.540]
This and we demand.

[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:07.480]
But it will put it out.

[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:08.040]
You demand.

[00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:13.980]
Yeah. I don't like that when people who are lawbreakers, just based out of the very way they come into the country,

[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.860]
I run around making all kinds of demands.

[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.380]
And I don't want to be treated like that while I go back where I came from.

[00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:19.360]
It would be treated great.

[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:20.160]
Okay.

[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:26.000]
If 99% of the people who were participating who weren't illegals themselves yesterday,

[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000]
if they knew what the conditions really were like in Mexico, which is where most of those people came from,

[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:33.580]
then they'd understand why they came here in the first place and why we have this mess.

[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:40.700]
And they'd understand that a country, just like Eisenhower said, a country that can't enforce its borders isn't a country and that's exactly correct.

[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.820]
You know, he said two interesting things in his life.

[00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:46.740]
They were both true about being worthy of industrial complex and that was the other one.

[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:51.280]
He can't complain about America's immigration policy because basically we don't have one.

[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:51.860]
Right.

[00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:52.680]
Out of control.

[00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:53.500]
OOC.

[00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:54.400]
Out of control.

[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:57.060]
Anyway, 900 and 12 votes on the poll.

[00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.240]
How did illegal alien day affect you?

[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:02.120]
We asked 900 and 12 votes are goals of 1000 during the show.

[00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:03.240]
I think we got a shot, Josh.

[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:03.860]
Definitely.

[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:04.980]
915.

[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:05.780]
Old bean.

[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:06.760]
Boy, look at this.

[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:08.820]
We're less than an hour away from those ratings coming out.

[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:09.260]
What is this?

[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:09.660]
It's raining.

[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:11.500]
Be something.

[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:13.900]
Scoring the first goal.

[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:14.640]
Oh, there you go.

[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.380]
There's Edmonton making that big comeback.

[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:17.280]
They were down to nothing.

[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:17.960]
They tied it up.

[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.820]
And then the truck went ahead and they tied it up again.

[00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:21.100]
They won 43 last night.

[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:22.180]
I know nobody cares.

[00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:24.880]
And the ducks of Curie Derser is the 7.

[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.540]
Beat the anxious Calgary flames.

[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:29.980]
915 votes illegal alien day.

[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:30.660]
How did it affect you?

[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:31.100]
Not at all.

[00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:31.720]
That's what I voted.

[00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:32.440]
660.

[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:34.440]
I didn't see any illegal aliens just there.

[00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:35.760]
I saw a bunch of schmata heads, though.

[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:37.700]
In fact, on Sunday they had a big march.

[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:40.340]
It wasn't a protest, but they had a big march with the...

[00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:41.560]
I guess they're all the cab drivers.

[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:42.500]
Yeah.

[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:44.620]
No, it was a sick march.

[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:45.960]
They all...

[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:48.000]
All the guys with the blue turban tail.

[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:48.940]
Oh, those cut us.

[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:49.680]
Those six.

[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.580]
No, the six guys in El-I-B-Illin.

[00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:51.760]
Ah.

[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:53.340]
The six, they were all there.

[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.680]
So if you need the cab in town, I guess that they would have been tough day to find one.

[00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:59.600]
Much less traffic yesterday on illegal alien day.

[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:00.520]
157.

[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.200]
Now, you notice my poll question.

[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:03.760]
How did illegal alien day?

[00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:06.280]
I didn't say how to day without immigrant effect you.

[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:09.280]
And I'm going to get to that Lou Dobbs commonement, although he gets a little carried away.

[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.080]
Leftist, communist.

[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.160]
I ever...

[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.640]
He'd be good in a little of anacres.

[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:14.900]
Everything is communist, the communist.

[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:15.320]
You know?

[00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:17.760]
Thank you, by the way, for using the proper labels.

[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:18.380]
Yes.

[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:19.500]
Illegal alien day.

[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.880]
And I can't imagine why we had one call yesterday.

[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:25.740]
Somebody saying, oh, there's all the noise and racking going on around Southwest A.

[00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:26.020]
Yeah.

[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:29.200]
I don't know why, because the people that came out that are on Southwest A.

[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:30.360]
Street didn't come in illegally.

[00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:31.020]
Okay.

[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.480]
There were a lot of blue-white flags like you were talking about.

[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.620]
Which I guess is Nick Raghwaz, that what they told us?

[00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:36.240]
On the Anawa?

[00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:36.600]
Yeah.

[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:37.500]
Is that what they said?

[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:42.240]
There was some red, white, and blue in the crowd there, but it was mostly blue and white flags that I saw in the local news.

[00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:43.020]
I see.

[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:44.280]
Or is it Honduras?

[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:45.160]
Or is it outside?

[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:45.540]
I don't know.

[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:05.060]
I don't know.

[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:05.060]

[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:05.060]

[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:05.060]

[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:05.060]

[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:05.060]

[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:05.060]

[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:05.060]

[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:05.060]

[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:05.060]

[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:05.060]

[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:05.060]

[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:05.060]

[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:05.060]

[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:05.060]

[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:05.060]

[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:05.060]

[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:05.060]

[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:05.060]

[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:05.060]

[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:05.060]

[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:05.300]
I don't know.

[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.120]
I don't know.

Jack RJ

[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:10.280]
Social workers visit and stay at home after her son fell out of a high chair and suffered a heavy injury.

[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:11.760]
Brittany, you're pregnant again.

[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:15.360]
What you're not doing a very good job of taking care of your first kid.

[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:15.880]
Thank you.

[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:17.320]
And I was responsible for that.

[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.260]
Yeah, your response was for his safety.

[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:21.140]
Well, I didn't think of it at the time.

[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:22.940]
I can't believe you've got an electric.

[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:24.420]
And Surround is real.

[00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:25.900]
Oh, yeah!

[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.260]
And he's playing with a bear trap.

[00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:29.480]
Oh, yeah.

[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:31.300]
Oh, this is a new toy.

[00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:33.460]
Exploding Elmo.

[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.020]
1044 at 560 WQM House.

[00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:39.500]
That schedule come when we got voted.

[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:40.500]
Oh, God.

[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:42.120]
What a relief.

[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:47.640]
And we got that 2 to 4 Mad Dog 4 to 630 at the Mickey Arena, Arizona arena.

[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.080]
For game number 5, they're the bulls of the heat tonight.

[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:51.940]
The heat better get their eggs together, right?

[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.120]
You guys need to do something.

[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:56.460]
They got wall up twice in Chicago there by a girls team.

[00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:57.100]
That's pretty embarrassing.

[00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:58.880]
Marlins on decades 630.

[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.940]
I'm sure we're going to have a fantastic tune in for that with that heat game on tonight.

[00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:06.980]
Marlins in the Phillies at the Stadium at 705 in any case follows that, which is a tough assignment.

[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.840]
6,017 the announce attendance last night.

[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.000]
I watched about...

[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.240]
In fact, that must have been the ending.

[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.160]
I tuned in when the Untel was blowing a game.

[00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:15.420]
What?

[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:16.240]
What are you laughing about?

[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:17.640]
Because it was 5 to 2 Marlins.

[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:18.780]
They had a nice comfortable lead.

[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:20.240]
It was about the 67th inning, I think.

[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:22.420]
And Phillies were starting to come back.

[00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:23.900]
They had a couple on and again infield.

[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:26.000]
They had the bases loaded and I turned back to the hockey game.

[00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:27.640]
You know, he actually pitched a good game.

[00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:31.580]
It's just for this team, he needs to like pitch all nine innings to then to win.

[00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:33.040]
He gave up eight runs.

[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.640]
Yeah, but what an eighth inning.

[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:38.540]
He gave up eight runs, Mr. and 7 on the third inning is right.

[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:39.580]
Eight runs.

[00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:41.000]
Now, he's supposed to...

[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:41.380]
He's a man.

[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:44.420]
He's the only guy that got that anybody ever heard of before on the pitch.

[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:45.680]
And you pitch a good seven innings.

[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:47.220]
You should be able to win a game, your starter.

[00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:50.000]
Yeah, but hey, your starter, your starter.

[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:50.280]

[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:51.720]
Well, let me just tell you this, Mr.

[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.100]
They stunk.

[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:54.040]
They stunk?

[00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:56.040]
They're 6 and 7 and 17.

[00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:56.720]
They stunk.

[00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.980]
And the crowd stunk and nobody cares.

[00:34:59.200 --> 00:34:59.460]
Okay.

[00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:00.760]
See, this is what gets me.

[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:01.580]
You know, got all these.

[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:04.480]
Just like Wayne again, nobody cares about hockey in that town.

[00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:05.420]
You could fit.

[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.080]
You could fit in your under your armpit.

[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:08.620]
The number of people are really care about hockey.

[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:09.260]
I mean, nobody.

[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:11.860]
And so we got to build that bigger arena just to keep Wayne happy

[00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:13.160]
because he's keep going, keeps threatening.

[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.080]
I'm going to move out.

[00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:16.900]
I'm going to take it to the team and go in somewhere.

[00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:17.940]
I'm going to Pocipsey.

[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.260]
I'm going to Scenectady.

[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.300]
You know, well, goodbye already.

[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.660]
You know, and the same thing with these losers, man.

[00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:26.000]
With his David Samsung and Delilah and Luria.

[00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:26.640]
God.

[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.240]
We're going to stand and tell me, well, goodbye already.

[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:31.720]
Okay, take up a strummy sandwich with you and have a good trip

[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:32.440]
and get lost.

[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:34.560]
And thanks for stiffing the public yet.

[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:35.500]
I got news for you.

[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:37.440]
They didn't just have a house cleaning man.

[00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:40.680]
They had, they had like even in Hiroshima, they never saw this.

[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:42.200]
They had a destination.

[00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:45.040]
In fact, I see a lot of similarities, but between what happened

[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:48.120]
with their organization and what happened with the Banjo

[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:48.740]
Boy Group Inc.

[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:49.860]
With this outfit.

[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:51.240]
Don't you see many similarities?

[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:52.120]
Huh?

[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:53.040]
Decimated.

[00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:54.260]
Absolutely, decimated.

[00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:56.300]
And by the way, if that normal don't we turn your email

[00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:57.020]
or your call today?

[00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:59.280]
I'm going to be so fraughting at the mouth with that

[00:35:59.280 --> 00:35:59.720]
faggot.

[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:00.480]
You have no idea.

[00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:01.980]
Keep sending me these emails.

[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.780]
Oh, well, George doesn't contact me.

[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:04.740]
And then you keep calling there.

[00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:05.920]
They don't, he's returning your messages.

[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:07.200]
He emailed him this morning.

[00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:08.640]
He's just playing fast and loose.

[00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:10.700]
He just wants to get talked about on your lot of publicity.

[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:11.500]
Yeah.

[00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:11.800]
God.

[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:12.760]
Oh, who can blame it?

[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:15.140]
Mr. Flandboy and faggot, the old FFR.

[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:16.320]
Anyway, Luda.

[00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:17.880]
Luda's job's rights.

[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.300]
Radical group's taking control of immigrant movement.

[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:23.580]
We all are worked headlines in our nation's most important newspapers

[00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:26.180]
reminding us that this is a day when I had immigrants, he said yesterday.

[00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:28.240]
Not illegal immigrants mind you, but immigrants.

[00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:31.240]
USA Today Headlined Today's Demonstrations in Boycott

[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:32.780]
on Immigration's Frontlines.

[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:34.520]
The New York Times headlines its story

[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:36.700]
with calls for boycott by immigrants employees

[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:38.240]
are gurd for the unknown.

[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.380]
The Washington Post and the LA Times are both

[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:42.260]
calling their coverage the immigration debate.

[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.500]
These major newspapers obviously don't

[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:46.280]
want to disturb their readers with the information

[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:47.820]
that today's demonstrations in Boycott

[00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:49.980]
are about illegal immigration and amnesty

[00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:51.200]
for illegal aliens.

[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:54.040]
CNN and Fox News are both using a banner

[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:55.780]
calling their coverage a day without immigrants,

[00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:58.940]
while MSNBC is titling its coverage immigrant anger.

[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:01.800]
Most of the mainstream media has been absolutely

[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:04.480]
co-opted by the open borders and illegal immigration advocates.

[00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:06.540]
I'm not opposed to demonstrations and protests

[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:07.680]
of any kind, says Lue.

[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.860]
Even by those who are not citizens of this country,

[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:12.100]
because one way or another, demonstrations and protests

[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:13.640]
enriching and bigger rate the national debate

[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.220]
and raise the public consciousness of truth.

[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:17.520]
But only one newspaper to its credit reported

[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.100]
that illegal aliens and their supporters

[00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:21.120]
boycott of the national economy on the first of May

[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.580]
is clear evidence that radical elements of C's

[00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:24.440]
control of the movement.

[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:26.840]
The Washington Post, a lot among national papers,

[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:29.460]
reported that answer act now to stop

[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:31.780]
foreign end racism has become an active promoter

[00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:32.740]
of the national boycott.

[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:35.140]
Some illegal immigration open borders activists

[00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:38.080]
in the Hispanic community are deeply concerned about the involvement

[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:39.340]
of the left wing radical group.

[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:41.120]
But others like Juan Jose Guediri,

[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:42.600]
who I've interviewed a number of times

[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:43.500]
over the past several months,

[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:46.160]
manages to be both director of Latino movement USA

[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.900]
and representative of answer.

[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.840]
As Guediri's told us on my show,

[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:51.760]
the time has come where we need to stand up

[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:52.500]
and make a statement.

[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:54.140]
We need to do what the American people did

[00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:55.660]
when they pulled away from the British crown.

[00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:57.300]
And I'm sure that back in those days,

[00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:59.920]
many people were concerned that that was radical action.

[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.400]
Just how significant is the impact of leftists

[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:03.840]
within the illegal immigration movement?

[00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:05.980]
It's no accident that they chose May 1st

[00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:07.460]
as their day of demonstration in boycott.

[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:10.120]
It's the worldwide day of commemorative demonstrations

[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:12.140]
by various socialist, communist,

[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.820]
and even anarchic organizations.

[00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:16.380]
Supporters of the boycott have made no secret

[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:18.220]
of their determination to try to shut down schools,

[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:19.580]
businesses, and entire cities.

[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.740]
Much of LA seven-street produce market

[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:23.580]
with supplies thousands of local restaurants

[00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:24.840]
and markets was closed.

[00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:27.220]
Many meatpacking companies like Cardinal and Tyson

[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:28.720]
also closing many of their plants.

[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.140]
The meatpackers are confirming what we know

[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:32.600]
is his University of Maryland Economics

[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:33.800]
Professor Peter Marici,

[00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:35.980]
and that this is a large group of illegal aliens

[00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.400]
in the US lowering the wage rate of semi-skilled workers,

[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:39.660]
people who are high school drop,

[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.560]
after high school graduates with minimal training.

[00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:44.820]
In fact, the meatpacking job paid 19 bucks an hour

[00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:47.300]
in 1980, but today the same job pays closer

[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:49.340]
than $9 an hour according to the labor department.

[00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:52.100]
That's entirely consistent with what we've been reporting

[00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:54.540]
that illegal aliens depress wages for US workers

[00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:56.980]
by as much as $200 billion a year

[00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:58.640]
in addition to placing a tremendous burden

[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.880]
on hospital schools and other social services.

[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:02.860]
Radicalism is not confined to good areas

[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:04.140]
and Latino movement USA.

[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:06.600]
Ernesto Navarrez of the LA Port Collective

[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:08.320]
is promising to shut down the Port of LA.

[00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:11.460]
Transportation and commerce will come to a grinding halt.

[00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:12.620]
He said they're gonna put a wall

[00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:13.700]
along the border with Mexico.

[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:15.720]
We're gonna put a wall between us and the ocean

[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.200]
and those containers ain't gonna move.

[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:19.400]
No matter which flag demonstrators and protesters

[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:21.140]
carry today, their leadership is showing

[00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:22.720]
its true colors to all who will see.

[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.400]
Says you're a hero, Lou Dots.

[00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:25.760]
You go Lou, you go.

[00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:26.960]
Totally you go.

[00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:27.480]
You go.

[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:28.480]
You'll leave.

[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:30.760]
Well, he's doing his thing.

[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.360]
You know, that's right up his alley, man.

[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.380]
Outstrosing a job is any legal.

[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:37.600]
Those are his two, that's his thing.

[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:38.200]
That's his thing.

[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:41.600]
It's a spas you just sent.

[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:42.020]
Let's see.

[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:44.060]
Oh, here's the thing about the,

[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:45.620]
no, these are not the flags.

[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:47.120]
Oh, well, according to this it was.

[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:48.720]
It was not an Argentinian flag.

[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:49.480]
It was Nicaragua.

[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:50.260]
Nicaragua.

[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.740]
It's Isabelle de Cassada used to say

[00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:53.380]
on the look of the moon.

[00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:54.060]
Nicaragua.

[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:54.760]
Nicaragua.

[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:58.540]
The blue pattern has come to all the Central American states

[00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:00.900]
being reminded of the union from the beginning of 19th century.

[00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:02.980]
Each of the five original countries find a way

[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:04.280]
to differentiate the flag.

[00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:06.800]
Costa Rica put a red strap in the middle.

[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:07.640]
Costa Rica.

[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:10.240]
Nicaragua and El Salvador, their coats of arms.

[00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:11.640]
Honduras five stars.

[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:13.280]
And Guatemala turned the stripes vertically.

[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:14.620]
I just looked them all up.

[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:17.820]
It's just Nicaragua that shade the Argentinian flag.

[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:18.660]
I think it outweighed.

[00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:20.280]
Oh, we saw of a sky blue shade.

[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:21.800]
Well, that's what I was trying to tell again.

[00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:22.360]
We didn't know.

[00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:23.960]
We got a few Argentinians,

[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:25.440]
but they came to watch some soccer games.

[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:27.400]
But that flag that we saw was Nicaragua.

[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:28.480]
Well, who cares?

[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:29.940]
What difference is it going to serve it?

[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:32.840]
All of the states except Guatemala have common elements

[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:34.780]
on their coat of arms, mountains, or volcanoes

[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:36.340]
with a sea on each side.

[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.120]
Successionist cap, spectrum star,

[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:39.700]
and inscription, America Central.

[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:41.700]
The triangle symbolizes equality.

[00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.460]
These civilians on land may use also the flag

[00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:44.180]
without the arms.

[00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:44.760]
Well, they go.

[00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:47.120]
In other words, like if you're like Bud Lynch,

[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.940]
and you only have one army, who still use the flag.

[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.180]
Bud Lynch is still doing the P-A-T trope

[00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:53.380]
by the way, with Joe Luevich and Joe.

[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:54.240]
Oh, I'm a god.

[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:55.840]
He's got to be 100 years old now.

[00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:57.520]
He used to come and feed us to myelories

[00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:58.180]
when I got one arm.

[00:40:58.260 --> 00:40:58.860]
That's very bad.

[00:40:59.020 --> 00:40:59.720]
That's a bad taste.

[00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:00.480]
Wouldn't you think?

[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:01.320]
I think.

[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.420]
He used to be the Red Wings announcer 100 years ago.

[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:04.800]
Bruce Martin and Bud Lynch, baby.

[00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:05.360]
You better get with it.

[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:07.320]
You don't know your hockey history, man, at all.

[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:07.940]
No.

[00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:09.240]
How are you ever going to survive in that town?

[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:09.820]
Easy.

[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:12.160]
984 votes on the pool.

[00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:13.800]
We might get very close to 1000

[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:14.900]
by the top of the first hour.

[00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:15.900]
989.

[00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:17.400]
They're coming in and chucks now.

[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:19.240]
WDQ, I am your legal line.

[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:19.520]
Hello.

[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:20.700]
Hi, Neil.

[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.980]
Well, I say what this really makes me mad.

[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:27.560]
It's taken money right out of my wallet.

[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:28.220]
Yeah.

[00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:30.260]
Because I'm just a slumber.

[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:31.780]
Just out here working.

[00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:33.820]
And I could be making more money

[00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:35.380]
if this wasn't going on.

[00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:37.060]
They're depressing your wages, man.

[00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:38.640]
And people don't understand.

[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:39.820]
I mean, it doesn't faze them.

[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:40.980]
The poor are.

[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:43.800]
And any group of people are willing to work for slave wages.

[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:45.860]
And it knocks everybody else's wages down,

[00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:47.440]
just like the thing about the meat packers.

[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:52.640]
I used to work at a young intended as a meat cutter.

[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:53.500]
Young intended?

[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:57.480]
Yeah, which is Northmore, Gold Kist.

[00:41:58.200 --> 00:41:58.500]
Yeah.

[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:02.700]
And we went on strike one year, that we actually had a union.

[00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:04.200]
Like it did a lot of good.

[00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:06.680]
The next phase, all the management,

[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:09.860]
had most loads of Mexicans coming in there.

[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:10.500]
And it didn't matter.

[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:11.320]
There you go.

[00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:12.280]
I don't know.

[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:13.700]
I don't know what to do, Neil.

[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.120]
I say all the Mexicans go back and straighten their own

[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:18.340]
country out of this, what I say.

[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.300]
I mean, I want to pick out Mexicans specifically,

[00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:21.520]
unless I have to, but I will.

[00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:23.140]
Because I've seen some documentaries,

[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:25.340]
especially recently, on a condition that go on.

[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:25.620]
Really?

[00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:27.680]
Slumber would be an understatement, OK?

[00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:29.660]
One of the stories that I posted while you were on vacation

[00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:31.540]
is all the horrible things that the Mexican government

[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:33.060]
does to people that want to get into Mexico

[00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:34.040]
from the south of them.

[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:34.600]
Right.

[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:35.960]
Now they just shoot them, or rob them,

[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:36.980]
or rape them or all of the above.

[00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:38.780]
Well, speaking of Robin and rape in them,

[00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:40.600]
I mean, people said, well, you travel all over Europe

[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:41.160]
and here and there.

[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:42.700]
And how come you never go to Mexico?

[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:45.440]
I thought about it a couple of times, about five minutes,

[00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:48.240]
and then I read about my first stories of the American

[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:48.440]
story.

[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:50.100]
How about that Canadian couple that went there?

[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:50.660]
Right.

[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:52.560]
Same old crap, man.

[00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:54.180]
Cab driver picks you up.

[00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:56.160]
And of course, maybe it's one of those gypsy cab drivers.

[00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:58.960]
And if he feels you got some expensive jewelry, some money,

[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:01.080]
he takes you out in the middle of a no man's land.

[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:03.520]
And if you're lucky, he'll just take everything you got.

[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:05.080]
And just turn your loose out there.

[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.480]
If you're not so lucky, it's a bad thing.

[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:09.200]
That's all nobody ever sees you rash again.

[00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:10.920]
That's not my idea of tourism.

[00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:12.480]
That's called murderous last time I checked.

[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:14.020]
Now we're going to probably get people say,

[00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:15.700]
oh, well, we went to Mexico City.

[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:18.240]
We went to a Acapulco and had a wonderful time.

[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:18.780]
Well, good.

[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.060]
OK, here are some of the lucky ones.

[00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:20.860]
You came back alive.

[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:23.240]
That's why I say I went out of Cruz and had a good time.

[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.380]
Well, that's great.

[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:25.080]
Congratulations.

[00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:27.080]
WQIM, hello.

[00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:29.520]
QIM.

[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:36.360]
What the hell was that?

[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:36.900]
I'm sorry.

[00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:38.040]
Me too.

[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:39.760]
WQIM, hello.

[00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:40.780]
Neil.

[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:41.560]
Yes, sir.

[00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:42.420]
How are you?

[00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:43.320]
How are you?

[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:43.860]
How are you?

[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:44.080]
I'm fine.

[00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:44.940]
All right, I think I'm OK.

[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:48.060]
About 30% of immigrants that got caught in the beach

[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:49.000]
when they did the right stuff.

[00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:50.240]
They were disneyed.

[00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:50.980]
They have.

[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:52.260]
I'll be damned.

[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:53.820]
What's all they're looking for?

[00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:58.000]
I'm trying to get away from those Nazis that invaded their country.

[00:43:58.340 --> 00:43:58.660]
Probably.

[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:01.340]
Maybe they're trying to get out a real man where men are men

[00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:02.480]
and some of the women are too.

[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:04.920]
One must be OK, thanks, pal.

[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.540]
Yeah, maybe that's what it is.

[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:09.300]
What I say, Buenos Aires is in Argentina.

[00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:10.760]
I've been talking about Rio's in Brazil.

[00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:11.160]
I'm sorry.

[00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:12.660]
I'm getting all my countries confused.

[00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:13.280]
That's OK.

[00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:13.920]
That's OK.

[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:14.880]
They're still both big cities.

[00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:17.340]
There's probably a lot of drag queens in Buenos Aires, too.

[00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:18.740]
How about San Diego?

[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:20.200]
How come we don't have no Chileans, man?

[00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:21.260]
Are they picking grapes or what?

[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:22.280]
That's a good question.

[00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:23.140]
Isn't that what Chile is?

[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:25.000]
I mean, I've been having two famous four.

[00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:25.760]
Come on.

[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:28.020]
You never heard of those good grapes from the sour grapes

[00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:28.500]
from Chile.

[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:30.340]
I might have never, never heard of them.

[00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:31.940]
So in grapes, man, it's fantastic.

[00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:32.640]
Good stuff.

[00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:34.540]
It'll give you good solid.

[00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:35.360]
Yeah.

[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:36.620]
Every time, man.

[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:37.560]
Results.

[00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:38.180]
Good solid.

[00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:39.340]
It'll make you real regular.

[00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:41.580]
A real regular clown.

[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.720]
And we don't have anything about Chile.

[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:46.260]
I realize that's pretty far away, but so is Argentina.

[00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:47.720]
How about Paraguay?

[00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:48.920]
How about them fascists, huh?

[00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:49.540]
Right.

[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.500]
And Peru, do we have any Peruvians

[00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:52.860]
pouring in across the border?

[00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:53.560]
We must.

[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:54.720]
But we must have a truck.

[00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:56.120]
And how about Venezuela, man?

[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:57.780]
They might want to stay there because they're getting

[00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:00.840]
truffs and gallon gas from Hugo Chavez.

[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:03.660]
I say we send George Bush to Venezuela

[00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:05.020]
and bring in Hugo Chavez.

[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:05.840]
How do you like that?

[00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:08.180]
Caesar Chavez and Hugo Chavez.

[00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:09.840]
And look what we got on our poll right now.

[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:11.540]
This is a clarion moment, man.

[00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:13.240]
A thousand votes, even.

[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:18.040]
This is Neil Roger Show.

[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:23.800]
This is the Neil Roger Show.

[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:26.580]
Well, this is your boy.

[00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:27.760]
How could you laugh?

[00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:29.560]
Any questions?

[00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:33.180]
Coming up tonight on Inside the Behind the True Hollywood

[00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:35.460]
Celebrity Music Bography Profile Story.

[00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:38.740]
If you look up Feel Good Music of the 80s

[00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:41.120]
in the dictionary, you won't find a thing.

[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:44.260]
But if, in a parallel universe, you

[00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:46.980]
could look up Feel Good Music of the 80s in the dictionary,

[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:50.000]
you'd probably find his big grinning love next to it.

[00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:52.600]
He was Kenny Laganside.

[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:55.200]
Now, it got a catch in his brain.

[00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:58.260]
It got a catch in his brain.

[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:01.600]
I'm just a tall thin white guy with a beard

[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:05.960]
who's one great joys to share some gentle, non-threatening good times.

[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:06.700]
What was that?

[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:08.400]
Did you say that makes me kind of gay?

[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:09.460]
I didn't say anything.

[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:11.720]
Listen, nobody calls Kenny Lagans gay.

[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:12.900]
But listen, you brought it up.

[00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:15.080]
What about that duet you did with Stevie Nicks?

[00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:17.220]
Whatever I call you.

[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:18.940]
What about it?

[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.740]
Whenever I call you friend, that's kind of gay.

[00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:23.080]
What about Danger Zone?

[00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:29.080]
Danger Zone Rocks, man.

[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:30.160]
All right.

[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:32.360]
Danger Zone versus what?

[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:33.600]
ACDC?

[00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:34.440]
ACDC.

[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:40.900]
Still going to tell me you rock, Kenny.

[00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:44.620]
This is the limit I am going to go meet my girlfriend,

[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.100]
walk around the outdoor mall in my chinos,

[00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:49.200]
get some frozen yogurt and kiss her.

[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:50.420]
Hard.

[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:52.120]
Kenny Lagans.

[00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:55.520]
Like they say, denial is not just the thing you do.

[00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:56.400]
Do avoid the truth.

[00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:58.600]
Oh, wait, that is what it is.

[00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:02.340]
It's a big juicy shopping web look at show business tonight,

[00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:03.660]
on Inside the Mind.

[00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:05.940]
It's 11.01 at 5.60 W.D.

[00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:08.180]
Here, we got the winter arbitrar rating

[00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:09.740]
going out in about a half an hour.

[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:13.440]
And man, oh, I've got to hit his align in that TV room right now

[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:15.020]
all the way out the door and up to Jacksonville.

[00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:15.760]
You think?

[00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:17.520]
It was kind of crowded when I went in there to see it.

[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:18.120]
Oh, yeah.

[00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:20.100]
And if it was crowded then you can just imagine

[00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:20.720]
what it is now.

[00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:21.740]
You probably can smell it.

[00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:22.760]
Well, it depends on you.

[00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:25.080]
I have to add pull, too bad pull reports for the Bushmeister.

[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:27.660]
I'll get to those in a second after we take a thousand calls.

[00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:31.580]
And then of course, Rush got the brush on a hand,

[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:32.680]
giving us smack on a hand.

[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:34.300]
That's what happens to rich white guys, man.

[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:35.780]
See, that kind of called in yesterday

[00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:37.320]
that it was all about the shape of about the duke

[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:37.940]
of the cross players.

[00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:40.060]
If you were to pick down Rush Limbaugh as an example,

[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.720]
I'd have said, yeah, that is a good example for you.

[00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:44.980]
White guys put a lot of money who get off when they do

[00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:46.700]
like Kobe Bryant, O.J. Simpson.

[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:48.600]
W.D.C.Y.M. Hello.

[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.280]
Yeah, how do I get a passport to Miami?

[00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:51.240]
Yeah.

[00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:55.380]
Oh, I think I don't think you want to go there, man.

[00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:56.220]
First you got to go to Cuba.

[00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:58.300]
I think he wants a passport out of Miami.

[00:47:58.420 --> 00:47:58.680]
That's right.

[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:00.820]
First you come to Canada, then you fly to Cuba.

[00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:02.680]
That's the way you do it.

[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:03.720]
You got plenty of flights.

[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:06.320]
Air Canada flies to Cuba many times today here.

[00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:07.000]
No problem.

[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:07.900]
That's because y'all are companies.

[00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:08.820]
That's right.

[00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:11.300]
A lot of coming pinkers up here and you can go to any cigar

[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:12.620]
store all over town and to run

[00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:14.420]
by all the Cuban or cigars you want.

[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:14.840]
That fake.

[00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:17.260]
Speaking of cigars, I sure hope if my ears ever open up,

[00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:18.780]
I can try those really nifty ones that

[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:20.160]
Brett sent me for 43 bucks.

[00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:21.960]
FedEx charges.

[00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:23.940]
Anybody ever make any comment about that?

[00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:24.480]
I'm sure not.

[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:26.220]
So because that would have indicated number

[00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:26.920]
when he was listening.

[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:28.520]
And number two, he admitted to being a jerk.

[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:29.840]
Hey, Brett, you're a jerk.

[00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:31.140]
One of our sales holes.

[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:32.740]
W.D.C.Y.M. Hello.

[00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:34.380]
NEO, good morning, sir.

[00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:35.380]
Where is this?

[00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:38.740]
I work in the street and I'd like to say

[00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:40.620]
if traffic is going to be like that, let's not.

[00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:41.500]
Well, wait, wait, wait, wait.

[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:42.920]
When do we mean work in the streets?

[00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:44.380]
Yeah, I work in the street.

[00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:46.040]
You know, I do the liries, you know,

[00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:47.280]
all kind of stuff.

[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:48.080]
Oh, I see.

[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:49.780]
And if traffic is going to be like that,

[00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:51.940]
I say we have illegal alien day quite a week, buddy.

[00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:52.280]
OK.

[00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:53.520]
Later, Bobbler.

[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:54.080]
OK.

[00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:59.980]
So illegal alien day, every day of the week,

[00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:01.300]
keep that traffic light.

[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:04.720]
When fact, much less traffic is a very strong second place,

[00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:05.580]
173.

[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:08.120]
In fact, other than not at all, it'd

[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:09.100]
be an affected by us today.

[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:11.200]
Much less traffic is numerator or uno.

[00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:12.980]
See, kick an ass.

[00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:13.780]
Big time.

[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:15.200]
70 QAM.

[00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:15.480]
Hello.

[00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:16.320]
Hello, Neil.

[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:17.020]
How are you, sir?

[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:17.420]
OK.

[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:17.920]
OK.

[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:18.300]
Oh, bad.

[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:20.360]
Hey, listen, I had a question for you.

[00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:22.620]
There's actually a comment on the best thing about yesterday.

[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:26.140]
There was less traffic and it looked wonderful to light.

[00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:28.620]
But more importantly, I wanted to know.

[00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:31.840]
Somebody get Mr. Rogers, so he could rub peanut butter on my

[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:32.540]
neck, both please.

[00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:35.900]
70 QAM.

[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:36.180]
Hello.

[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:38.440]
And what are you going to stand up, Neil, and do something?

[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:41.040]
I mean, go to the gas tank.

[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:42.360]
Go to the waste truck and fill up.

[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:44.440]
So you could just tell Chevron to stick it.

[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:45.740]
Fill it up the waste truck.

[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:46.580]
Startle the revolution.

[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:47.800]
The revolution has begun.

[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:49.300]
Go to the gas tank.

[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:49.660]
Oh, yeah.

[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:52.240]
All right.

[00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:55.400]
Little did we realize the good shipment was coming in today.

[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:57.420]
That's what we were doing yesterday, because there was too

[00:49:57.420 --> 00:50:00.560]
much confusion and constipation and constipation.

[00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:03.120]
But the shipment obviously arrived today and we only

[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:04.480]
want to know where our part is.

[00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:05.040]
That's right.

[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:05.760]
It's nice to hear.

[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:08.300]
WQYM, hello.

[00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:09.160]
Hello.

[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:10.120]
Hello.

[00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:11.020]
Yes, sir.

[00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:12.120]
He was Mexican labor day.

[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:12.980]
Yeah.

[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:14.420]
That's what it was.

[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:15.760]
Hey, you know what?

[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:19.220]
Neil, I have a radio station crossing with you.

[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:19.820]
It's really bad.

[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:20.920]
I'm sure you probably heard of it already.

[00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:21.960]
Yeah, we heard about it.

[00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:23.880]
And this station doesn't tell us anything about it.

[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:25.820]
We're supposed to pretend it doesn't exist, yeah.

[00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:29.420]
There, like, you hear between you and some more Mexican species.

[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:32.100]
That's that Mexican government again.

[00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:32.680]
It's a bunch of illegal.

[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:34.740]
It's probably got a private station on 560.

[00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:36.020]
Bye.

[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:37.380]
OK, thanks for the good news.

[00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:38.340]
You were hearing a lot of that.

[00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:43.340]
And back in the day, at WS News, we had this also when Castro cranked up one of his

[00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:46.940]
stations on 790, no less back in WNWS back in the day.

[00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:52.080]
And so what we did is we filed with the FCC and to go from 5,000 to 10,000 watts and we

[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:54.740]
got approval pretty quickly and went to 10,000 watts.

[00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:57.880]
And just we overpowered them with a louder signal, OK?

[00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:01.040]
Now we could be doing that here at QAAM, but of course we're not going to do it.

[00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:05.980]
We wrote a letter to the State Department and we're upset and what are we going to do

[00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:07.140]
like that, you know?

[00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:09.140]
I have a suggestion for management.

[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:11.180]
First of all, you cannot do it to me.

[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:12.640]
What the hell?

[00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:13.300]
Exactly.

[00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:14.840]
Stand up to a man.

[00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:15.800]
Don't put up with him.

[00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:18.560]
Spiny little Mexican's in that illegal station here on 560.

[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:19.820]
Crank this baby up.

[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:22.840]
I remember one of the first lies that Greg Reed told me when he was trying to entice me

[00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:26.720]
to sign with his outfit with the Banjo boy group pink.

[00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:33.420]
Oh, we can go 50,000 watts and about a bit of up and we five tower array in the Everglades.

[00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:35.060]
Yeah, they're going to spend the money.

[00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:38.140]
They would like put up the towers to go directional and go 50,000 watts.

[00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:43.520]
On a scale of minus infinity, what we just say the chances that happening are none, none,

[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:46.580]
none to much, much, much less than none.

[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:49.760]
Zero, settle, 1023 votes, man.

[00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:50.540]
That's pretty impressive.

[00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:53.660]
How did the illegal alien day yesterday affect you?

[00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:55.900]
Not at all, 736.

[00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:58.160]
Much less traffic, 174.

[00:51:58.780 --> 00:52:02.580]
Spent some extra money just out of spite just to be real far-bitten, 47.

[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.020]
Didn't go to work, 19.

[00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:05.680]
I hate this pool, 17.

[00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:07.280]
Didn't open my business, 12.

[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.180]
Didn't go shopping, 12.

[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:10.540]
Worst traffic, 7.

[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:11.760]
And I must be in homestead.

[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:13.520]
And didn't go to school, none.

[00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:14.980]
Out of a thousand and 30.

[00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:17.480]
Out of 1030, W.D.B.C. and Boston, 1030.

[00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:18.280]
Radio 103.

[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:20.780]
Top of the Bruce Bradley show on W.D.B.C.

[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:24.120]
Here's Dave Maynard and Carl D'Souzen, Jefferson, K and J. Dunn.

[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:25.360]
Boy, that was a great station, you know.

[00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:26.060]
No.

[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:30.980]
Leafs, T-Win, TV, when they were talking about some report from W.D.B.C.

[00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:33.140]
and Boston, this punk Jeff Merrick, who was a real idiot.

[00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:36.220]
He says, oh, here's this story from W.D.B.Z. in Boston.

[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:40.120]
Now, I realize that Canadian say, now, a Canadian say Z for the letters Z.

[00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:42.200]
It's a holdover, I guess, from the Brits.

[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:43.200]
They just can't help themselves.

[00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:46.700]
But anybody who's in the radio business to be seen, W.D.B.Z.

[00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:48.420]
I mean, come on, man.

[00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:49.400]
Come on, Jeff.

[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:50.940]
Push up a little, you silly person.

[00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:52.880]
And Bill Waters just made an idiot out of it.

[00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:53.720]
Nice call, Billy Boy.

[00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:54.260]
Listen, Wade.

[00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:57.380]
W.D.Q.A.M. Hello.

[00:52:57.740 --> 00:52:59.880]
I like yesterday, Pollywood, chop the cow.

[00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:00.540]
Hold for me.

[00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:02.060]
Come on, come on, come on.

[00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:03.560]
Come on to Q.A.M. Hello.

[00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:04.580]
How are you today?

[00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:05.160]
OK, sir.

[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:06.740]
On the immigration hot day.

[00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:07.360]
Yeah.

[00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:08.700]
Quick comment.

[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:12.260]
I find myself being more and more upset with our government

[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:15.160]
than the illegal immigrants themselves.

[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:17.820]
They had enforced the laws that are in effect.

[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:18.560]
Yeah.

[00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:21.180]
I mean, they haven't been for 30, 40 years now.

[00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:23.560]
Do you remember the old scam they had

[00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:25.900]
that to get some of the people who jumped

[00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:27.780]
the old company one or prize or something?

[00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:30.200]
And they come and collect the prize and they arrest them.

[00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:32.040]
Well, yesterday would have been the perfect day

[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:33.320]
to gather more of illegal.

[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:36.300]
Well, everybody needed a pretty big net yesterday.

[00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:39.260]
A little net would have been a start at least.

[00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:40.340]
Yeah, a butterfly net.

[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:42.660]
It just fires me up.

[00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:44.540]
I'm a good day.

[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:45.140]
OK.

[00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:51.460]
Would gas prices sky high in Oendon, Iraq

[00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:53.580]
were inside President W.S. approval rating

[00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:55.720]
is in an all-time low in two polls.

[00:53:56.400 --> 00:54:00.120]
The new CBS poll only 33% approve of Mr. Bush's performance

[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:02.040]
as lowest approval rating yet in that poll.

[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:05.020]
And majority 58% say they disapprove.

[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:08.340]
74% of Americans disapprove of the president's handling

[00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:09.820]
of the gas prices.

[00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:11.260]
Thank you, Mr. President.

[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:14.340]
So betty, betty much for those low gas prices, by the way.

[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:16.880]
You fashest bastard, you, you bastard.

[00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:19.600]
And six months before Republicans

[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:21.600]
tried to hold onto Congress in the fall elections

[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:23.720]
and new poll shows that President Bush has

[00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:25.480]
decided to lowest approval rating of his presidency

[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:28.280]
and majority of voters say they vote for Democrats in November.

[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:32.060]
A USA Today Gala Poll taken this past weekend

[00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:35.060]
found Bush's approval rating down to 34 points in that poll,

[00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:37.240]
two points under his previous low.

[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:39.500]
He's feeling mighty low.

[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:41.920]
He also received the lowest ratings of his presidency

[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:44.900]
on his handling of the economy, energy, and foreign affairs,

[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:49.460]
tying his previous low on Iraq 32%, a tranquidose.

[00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:53.240]
The poll showed Democrats leading 54% to 39% of my registered voters.

[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:55.680]
What has which party they'd prefer to congressional race?

[00:54:56.940 --> 00:54:57.540]
How do you like that?

[00:54:57.680 --> 00:54:59.120]
54% to 39%.

[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:01.540]
Republicans falling faster than that ball in Times Square

[00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:02.480]
on New Year's Eve.

[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:03.840]
That's what Dick Clark said.

[00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:05.360]
He knows his crap.

[00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:06.560]
By the way, he's still alive.

[00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:07.200]
How do you like that?

[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:07.980]
Yeah, he is.

[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:08.560]
Sort of.

[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.420]
Here, footy is retiring this week.

[00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:11.180]
We had that on yesterday.

[00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:11.520]
Yeah.

[00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:12.740]
It's big news and radio, man.

[00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:13.600]
Footy is retiring.

[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:14.460]
Anybody interested?

[00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:15.700]
Anybody even know who that is?

[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:15.920]
No.

[00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:19.540]
32% of the only, I think only Ronson John has been on the

[00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:22.160]
or longer and had less impact in the market than the footy.

[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:24.920]
Ronson John's been on the year 72 years in South Florida.

[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:25.800]
Nobody ever heard of him.

[00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:27.480]
Except he did the P at the ball games.

[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:29.640]
Was it the dolphin games he did when he already

[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:30.280]
did the Marlins?

[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:31.540]
I don't think he did the Marlins, did he, John?

[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:32.300]
No.

[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:33.600]
Never heard of him.

[00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:34.540]
So I see.

[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:35.000]
There you go.

[00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:37.720]
But he's been on the year for 110 years in South Florida.

[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:41.040]
Ronson John on a magic, whatever he's on.

[00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:42.140]
On pills.

[00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:44.120]
Oh, look at that.

[00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:46.580]
Malvo said to testify against Mohammed.

[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:48.980]
That'll probably piss off those schmataids again.

[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:51.100]
Remember Lee Malvo and that John Mohammed?

[00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:52.440]
The snipers.

[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:53.720]
They were the snipers, baby.

[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:56.560]
When I was in big story news, you were the snipers.

[00:55:56.660 --> 00:55:56.860]
Yeah.

[00:55:58.340 --> 00:55:58.740]
WQIAM.

[00:55:58.820 --> 00:55:58.980]
Hello.

[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:01.340]
Yeah, Neil.

[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:02.120]
Yes, sir.

[00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:06.500]
My you miss one of Blaine went on the pole.

[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:08.080]
My favorite hooker just there.

[00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:09.080]
Yeah, OK.

[00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:11.040]
WQIAM.

[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:11.260]
Hello.

[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:12.960]
Hi, which of last number?

[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:13.980]
No, God.

[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:15.920]
Whatever it is, you ain't getting it.

[00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:17.140]
Was that that was him on it?

[00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:17.800]
Oh, yeah.

[00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:20.180]
Just give us a jingle, OK?

[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.520]
Just look it up on our website.

[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:23.560]
It's right there.

[00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:28.860]
56070560, pound 560 in the Verizon and Singular wireless line.

[00:56:29.180 --> 00:56:30.440]
That was very bad on your part.

[00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:32.920]
That was just kind of contemptible.

[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:34.240]
WQIAM.

[00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:34.440]
Hello.

[00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:36.300]
You're going to Canada.

[00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:37.420]
Yeah, huh?

[00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:39.460]
Yeah, we're waiting for Thursday.

[00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:41.180]
Thursday's his day for medication.

[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:42.760]
WQIAM.

[00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:43.000]
Hello.

[00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:45.160]
Especially like the personality too.

[00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:45.900]
Put a lot into it.

[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:46.960]
WQIAM.

[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:47.640]
Hello.

[00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:49.480]
It's a little alien.

[00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:50.960]
It's in the basket.

[00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:52.540]
WQIAM.

[00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:53.380]
I got fresh.

[00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:56.360]
All right.

[00:56:56.860 --> 00:56:58.120]
Yeah, I told you to put it on.

[00:56:58.280 --> 00:56:58.680]
I wasn't a while.

[00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:01.040]
And Whitney snorted it.

[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:02.680]
1044 votes.

[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:04.600]
Well, I tell you, if we do as well in the book,

[00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:06.460]
where the book comes out as we're doing on these poles,

[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:10.040]
man, we are kicking some big fat, serious, smelly pimpley ass.

[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:12.940]
In spite of the tremendously entertaining diverse programming

[00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:14.820]
that's putting on across the street according to them.

[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:16.140]
Just ask Greg Kotex.

[00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:16.580]
He'll tell you.

[00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:20.900]
Man, like I said before, you can try all you like.

[00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:22.940]
You can't talk yourself into success.

[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:25.980]
You can put a pile of dog manure on a table,

[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:27.140]
and you can dial it all up.

[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:29.300]
You know how they do in fancy gourmet restaurants

[00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:31.760]
with the desserts, and they put the little stuff

[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:32.400]
around the edges.

[00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:34.220]
They put a little tiny dessert in the middle of the plate

[00:57:34.220 --> 00:57:35.220]
on a big plate.

[00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:37.360]
And they put a little bit of chocolate and raspberry.

[00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:38.700]
Or you know what I'm talking about?

[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:39.460]
What do they call that?

[00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:39.960]
I don't know.

[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:41.000]
But I know what you're talking about.

[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:41.880]
But you know what I'm saying.

[00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:44.620]
Now, you could put a whole bunch of that around that dog

[00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:44.840]
manure.

[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:45.440]
You know something?

[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:47.640]
Anybody that walks in within five seconds

[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:49.640]
or go, oh, it smells like dog manure in here.

[00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:52.400]
And the same thing with these guys across the street, man.

[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:54.880]
As weak as we're probably going to be in this book,

[00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:57.520]
I effort it for them evil, horrible things.

[00:57:57.840 --> 00:58:00.520]
Because as Joel Feinberg once very accurately said,

[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:02.240]
we would do anything to hurt them.

[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:04.320]
Except for our buddy Joe Rose, we liked Joe.

[00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:05.640]
But other than that, we would do anything

[00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:07.640]
to punish them, to brutalize them.

[00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:09.980]
We used to like booster too, until he got in the data

[00:58:09.980 --> 00:58:12.140]
then the bastards pocket with both hands.

[00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:13.440]
Here's the fact.

[00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:14.420]
Has it come to this?

[00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:15.960]
I just have things gotten so bad that Americans

[00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:18.720]
are not fighting for what is a fruit picking

[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:20.100]
and domestic job service?

[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:21.760]
What has happened to the real jobs?

[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:23.440]
The high tech and good service jobs,

[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:24.620]
the benefits and career advancement.

[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:25.520]
They all went to India.

[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:25.800]

[00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:26.520]
They're outsourced.

[00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:29.180]
People hate the illegals because they're Mexicans.

[00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:31.340]
If it was really about Jews, why aren't people

[00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:33.400]
voting out all the politicians who have outsourced

[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:36.720]
our economy and refuse to raise the minimum wage?

[00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:37.540]
Says aren't highly.

[00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:39.120]
What did the Jews got to do with that?

[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:40.020]
I don't know.

[00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:41.720]
What do you think about that comment?

[00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:42.440]
That's a plot.

[00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:42.980]
Yeah.

[00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:44.140]
What about the engines, man?

[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:46.280]
This guy, no, people don't hate the illegal.

[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:48.120]
In fact, I don't think people hate the imperial.

[00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:50.240]
I think that they just pissed off because they're illegal.

[00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:52.980]
He says they hate the illegals because they're Mexicans.

[00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:54.160]
No, because they're illegal.

[00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:55.920]
We have a system of immigration.

[00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:57.120]
It's a country of laws.

[00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:59.080]
OK, you don't just pick and choose and decide,

[00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:00.400]
well, I'm going to come in and I want this

[00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:02.260]
and I want that and I want a better way of life.

[00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:04.060]
There's a lot of people want a better way of life.

[00:59:04.460 --> 00:59:06.120]
And by the way, not all of them want to come to America.

[00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:08.280]
I don't see civilians and civilians

[00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:10.460]
of people just sneaking across the Canada,

[00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:12.300]
the US border to go into the US, do you?

[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:13.100]
No.

[00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:14.820]
I wonder what that's all about.

[00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:18.400]
And maybe because the people here have a pretty damn good, eh?

[00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:20.700]
Maybe because things are so bad, maybe because they're not

[00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:22.240]
a little like shleppers like in Mexico.

[00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:24.440]
And they're not making babies like cockroaches

[00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:26.680]
because they don't pay too much attention to the Pope here.

[00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:28.200]
They don't even read any Pope here.

[00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:28.740]
How do you like that?

[00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:30.160]
Which is very good choice in our party.

[00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:33.260]
1150 in the Q&A, but a pressure is building, man.

[00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:34.360]
I think it would have a gigantic.

[00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:35.560]
Oh, man.

[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:38.060]
You're going to have to dump it because when that sound comes

[00:59:38.060 --> 00:59:40.320]
across, you'll be able to smell it.

[00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:40.960]
That's all right.

[00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:41.860]
We can dump gigantic.

[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:44.000]
That's what I'm talking about.

[00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:46.540]
You know, soundflow is famous for its trade shows.

[00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:49.760]
They're both shows, car shows, bridal shows, home shows,

[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:51.160]
art fairs, galore, and more.

[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:52.760]
Now, if you're a trade show exhibitor,

[00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:55.120]
the one game you need, the one name and game you need

[00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:55.880]
to know is Pub-Set.

[00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:58.580]
Pub-Set creates the absolute top of the line attention

[00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:01.300]
grabbing, steal customers from the competition trade show

[01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:01.720]
displays.

banners, and especially trade show displays.

[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:15.420]
Pub-Set's been doing the very best for 14 years.

[01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:20.380]
954-7727275 right it down for Pub-Set.

[01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:23.500]
It's 954-7727274.

[01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:25.040]
75, what I say?

[01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:27.320]
772-77275 was closed.

[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:28.580]
One of them wasn't the one that were off.

[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.400]
It's like I missed out on that lot of that day.

[01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:33.340]
From design to setup, Pub-Second and audio trade show needs,

[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:35.640]
and rest assured that Pub-Set will separate you

[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:36.400]
from the competition.

[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.840]
Don't look second rate, you only get one chance to look great.

[01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:40.160]
Pub-Set is the way to do it.

[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:43.500]
Call 954-7727275.

[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:46.420]
Like I said, we're going to Pub-Set SF.com.

[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:49.360]
For top notch design, trade show graphics, and displays,

[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:51.040]
Pub-Set's the smart way to do it.

[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:53.080]
Look for my ugly-ass picture on your building along

[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:54.780]
Dixie Highway, just North of Commercial Boulevard,

[01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:59.600]
and then call Pub-Set today at 954-7727275.

[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.260]
This is Neil Rogers.

[01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:06.440]
This is 5.62 AF.

[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:09.700]
We're going to land the chicken here.

[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:12.260]
We want the world to be a jerk.

[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:15.440]
We'll cut your grass, boom, be a man.

[01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:20.460]
The well-ehas of the best, everything and done.

[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:24.380]
They come into America to cut your bones.

[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:26.180]
They're all in your dreams.

[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:28.080]
They're the watch your cars.

[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:30.960]
Try to avoid the immigration.

[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:32.860]
Start on a man's border.

[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:36.540]
How can man no stop and fail?

[01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:41.040]
I'm the way, things you want.

[01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:42.880]
The jobs we want.

[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:45.900]
You're holding it, paid into the dollar.

[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:49.900]
Or two weeks to ship them all down the alley.

[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:54.340]
Gain me, let them go, then when did the chain?

[01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:56.100]
Yeah!

[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:01.020]
Come, we're open to dark.

[01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:03.280]
You will be the star.

[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:05.460]
The well-evolved of the cross.

[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:07.340]
The indraciduit's yours.

[01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:11.600]
They come into America to do what you want.

[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:14.760]
At all the ones that stand on the fun.

[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:18.620]
All they want is you as long as you clean and thus.

[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:23.220]
They're fallen off and there's no stopping there.

[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:25.700]
They're all in the game.

[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:29.180]
They're the sisters for the embarrassed.

[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:33.200]
You're the reason that's why they start to quit men.

[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:37.820]
On the streets go on and give them all of these up.

[01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:42.720]
They're all going away and we're coming to the end.

[01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:44.160]
That's a good idea.

[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:49.720]
All the Indian people came to America to say,

[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:50.620]
I'm a J&RU.

[01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:54.180]
Never partner whoever that might be.

[01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:55.500]
I think I have a pretty good idea.

[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:56.080]
Life partner?

[01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:57.220]
Yeah, her life partner.

[01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:58.580]
Somebody looks like Madeline Albright.

[01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:01.700]
21 past 11 at 5.60 WDQAM.

[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:03.820]
174 votes on a pool.

[01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:05.460]
Why that's an important stuff on here, man.

[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:08.480]
Including driver arrested and road rage attack on Jason Taylor.

[01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:09.220]
You saw that guy.

[01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:10.000]
You already told me that.

[01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:13.420]
Oh boy, he looks strange.

[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:17.520]
But speaking of strange, just amazing how we keep going back

[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:18.600]
to the same crooks again.

[01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:21.260]
Ahmed Chalibay, the man who helped provide cooked intelligence

[01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:22.860]
on a rank to the Pentagon New York Times,

[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:26.180]
is once again being engaged by the US and policy decisions

[01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:27.360]
on Iraq and Iran.

[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:27.640]
Right.

[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:29.780]
He gave all of our secrets to Iran.

[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.520]
And so now we're going to sign them up again.

[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:33.220]
Well, we might want to cook something up on them.

[01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:34.760]
I got all kinds of good stuff.

[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:38.940]
And this story, just, this is what they ought to be screaming about

[01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:41.180]
instead of the duke and the lacrosse players and all of their crap.

[01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:45.920]
MSNBC confirms out at CIA agent Valerie Plain was working on Iran.

[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:49.320]
And the story that they had last night on NBC NewsWars,

[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:52.740]
or maybe I saw the MSNBC, was that once she was outed,

[01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:55.400]
and of course was no longer useful as a CIA agent,

[01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:58.840]
that cut off their ability to really be on the inside

[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:00.000]
and around what that was going on.

[01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:02.220]
So just another just floundering around

[01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:05.920]
and making all kinds of threats and posturing and et cetera and so on.

[01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:09.860]
We're going to nuke here because obviously politics

[01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:12.040]
and getting even and smearing and smearing Joe Wilson

[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:14.320]
was more important than keeping her identity secret.

[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:16.480]
So I'm thinking that all the people involved,

[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:18.360]
and including that anxious Bob Novak,

[01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:21.720]
that old bullfrog, Bob Novak, they ought to be on death row, right?

[01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:22.720]
People involved in that.

[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:25.640]
And speaking of Crux, Silvio Berlusconi today is the day

[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:27.200]
officially to win the towel.

[01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:29.260]
One of the world's biggest Crux,

[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.420]
the real Fashist stuff there ever was when he makes Mussolini

[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:33.400]
look like Ted Kennedy.

[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:35.740]
That's how far to the right he is, Silvio Berlusconi.

[01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:37.600]
Fashist, they finally resigned, you know?

[01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:40.500]
They tried to find out the way he called up Bush to see if they could fix the election

[01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.560]
and Bush said, sorry, Pali, can't help you out.

[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:43.120]
Too late.

[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:45.080]
Catherine Harris has got her own problems.

[01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:48.180]
1777 votes on that pull man rolly,

[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:50.400]
seven to ten minutes away from the beginning of,

[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:51.780]
could be the beginning of something good?

[01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:52.820]
Remember that song?

[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:55.500]
This could be the start of something big Steve Lawrence and Edie Gorham

[01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:56.380]
who is missing that?

[01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:57.220]
I'm sure I don't have that.

[01:04:57.620 --> 01:04:59.120]
Try to think, no, I know, that's in the 50s.

[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:01.840]
Try to think who won't say Edie Gorham on the year.

[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:02.620]
Try to do it.

[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:04.580]
Somebody of, probably a Rush Limbaugh.

[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:06.500]
And it could either be that,

[01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:08.840]
or this could be the start of the, this is the end.

[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.860]
Remember the door is this the end, my friend?

[01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:11.420]
Could be that.

[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:12.420]
I don't know.

[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:13.480]
Rock solid.

[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:15.260]
W.A.M. illegal line.

[01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:15.500]
Hello.

[01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:16.660]
Hello.

[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:17.460]
Yes sir.

[01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:18.660]
Hey, what's up Neal?

[01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:19.580]
Neal, you know what?

[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:24.420]
I think one of these illegal Mexican immigrants that weren't hard

[01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:28.700]
and provide for the family any day before an African American

[01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:31.000]
that sits on a little crate in the middle of the,

[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:31.220]
okay, great.

[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:32.640]
Okay.

[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:35.120]
Not that he's racist or anything like that.

[01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:35.980]
I did the dumb.

[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:39.280]
5670560, Pali, you would take one?

[01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:40.020]
In other words, for what?

[01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:41.380]
For like your slave is Edith?

[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:41.860]
That's right.

[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:43.500]
That's one of your people, by the way,

[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:44.960]
something like he's from Nicaragua, probably.

[01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:46.720]
Go back to Nicaragua, okay?

[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:50.160]
Go back with Isabella Cassada, Nicaragua.

[01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:51.840]
Do we actually have anybody?

[01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:54.400]
I know we got that professional Elliott Rodriguez is still on

[01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:55.140]
here on Channel 4.

[01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:56.920]
God, he gives me spielkeys.

[01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:59.380]
Remember, and of course then, there's always spielkeys in a ray.

[01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:01.040]
W.A.M. Hello.

[01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:02.060]
Hello.

[01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:02.920]
Yes sir.

[01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:04.320]
Yeah, let's speak to Neal.

[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:04.980]
Speaking.

[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:07.000]
Hey, Neal, I got a great plan.

[01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:08.700]
You came to touch down it yesterday.

[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:13.700]
Every one of these people, when they apply, if they're going to allow them to become

[01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:17.020]
citizens, the very first thing they got to do is serve in the draft.

[01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:19.380]
I mean, after all, it's time to war.

[01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:21.140]
I say send to Iraq, baby.

[01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:22.640]
All the illegal is going to Iraq.

[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:23.640]
I agree.

[01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:24.140]
I told you.

[01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:27.500]
Maybe in the United States, let's give them a visa, master card, and send to Iraq.

[01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:28.560]
You got it, boss.

[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:29.060]
Take care.

[01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:31.020]
Okay, put them right there on the front lines, eh?

[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:32.300]
Who's up there, Army?

[01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:34.040]
I mean, Colin Paul said we didn't send enough troops.

[01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:37.820]
Let's just train these bastards and say, okay, go over there and kick some ass, okay?

[01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:41.020]
And a bit they got some nice low-paying wages, uh, wage jobs and how about...

[01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:45.580]
I mean, how about instead of picking cotton and grapes and lettuce, how about picking a good fight with seven em.

[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:46.360]
My head.

[01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:47.660]
Pickin' land on a terrorist.

[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:48.240]
That's right.

[01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:48.900]
Pick this.

[01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:51.280]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:54.640]
I think I got it like, you know, I think maybe I have a pitch-nerver in my neck.

[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:55.860]
Would that affect my shoulder, too?

[01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:56.140]
Yes.

[01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:57.800]
When, what do you do for that?

[01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:00.020]
Uh, well, much, I guess.

[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:02.960]
Wait, take a muscle relicer or go see a specialist.

[01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:04.620]
Go see a specialist to do what?

[01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:08.060]
To look at your neck to experience, to make sure that that's what's going on there.

[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:08.960]
What do you mean by that?

[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:09.920]
But I didn't say the C word.

[01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:11.020]
I see.

[01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:11.940]
Sonoran's like a cat.

[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:12.900]
A tumor in my neck?

[01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:13.700]
Like a real doctor.

[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:18.100]
No, they can actually connect to see if there is indeed a pitch-nerver inflammation or something like that.

[01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:18.340]

[01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:19.840]
Well, what's the C word got to do with that?

[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:20.920]
The chiropractor.

[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:22.280]
Oh, you didn't say that C word.

[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:23.640]
I thought that was a cancer like that.

[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:24.940]
No, no, not that.

[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:25.720]
Oh, well, why not?

[01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:27.680]
Oh, chiropractor, I don't...

[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:27.900]
That's right.

[01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:28.720]
My brother was a chiropractor.

[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:29.000]
That's right.

[01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:29.680]
He was on my back.

[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:30.220]
That's right.

[01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:34.100]
That would be the last thing I would go, and I just waited out.

[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:34.920]
I think he had a good idea.

[01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:36.660]
I maybe got some of them extra sanctos.

[01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:38.120]
Versitis, ass burns.

[01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:39.960]
You know, there's nothing like that.

[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:40.660]
That's what Joyce told me.

[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:41.860]
There ain't nothing like good ass burn.

[01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:44.260]
In fact, the ratings are coming out pretty soon speaking of that.

[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:47.280]
26 past 11 a.k.a.

[01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:47.580]
I am.

[01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:48.740]
Oh, man.

[01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:50.300]
The pressure is on.

[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:51.300]
Can you just imagine?

[01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:52.480]
Oh, man.

[01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:53.380]
Woo!

[01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:55.560]
Clarins poor Clarins, man.

[01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:56.440]
He was into this morning.

[01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:59.560]
He just shed in tears like Alison, Alison, Wonderland.

[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:03.920]
And then Hank whipping all over his ass because yesterday, Clarins in the beast had a

[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:08.240]
baghank to stay on past 9-10 because he had that big celebrity golf tournament to go to.

[01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:09.960]
They had a bag and cleaned with him.

[01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:10.940]
They had it like a negotiate.

[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:13.860]
They had it bring in the negotiated, equit play and pinuckle under Godfather.

[01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:18.740]

of oranges for a few days.

That's 1-800-447-4348.

[01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:30.260]
This is Neal Rogers.

[01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:34.280]
This is 5.62-8.

[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:38.700]
W-I-O-D-O-I-HAT station.

[01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:43.780]
All right.

[01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:47.020]
I think the damn price is rising.

[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:49.140]
I think it's a good thing.

[01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:54.440]
I'm trying to over here.

[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:57.720]
I see gas prices fell rising.

[01:09:58.240 --> 01:09:58.980]
Don't go so slowly.

[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:03.060]
I see people who can't pay.

[01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:04.220]
What if it's a line?

[01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:07.140]
Don't drop off the line.

[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:09.760]
Cause the cost is outside.

[01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:13.840]
They'll get rise on the rise.

[01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:15.320]
I think you're wet.

[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:17.000]
I see.

[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.340]
Yes, you're freezing hunger.

[01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:24.700]
I see their owners full of fear.

[01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:30.220]
They'll see if I reach numbers.

[01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:35.480]
When they get their gas bill for the year.

[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:39.520]
Or, they don't drop off the line.

[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:42.100]
But the cost is outside.

[01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:46.300]
They'll get rise on the rise.

[01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:48.720]
11-33-27.

[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:51.740]
Thank you again, Mr. President Day for those low gas prices.

[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.360]
Any second now, any second I'm going to bring in.

[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:56.980]
Bringing you my back pages for the birds.

[01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:58.640]
I got my stapler all set here.

[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:00.720]
I got a whole, I got a reem over there, man.

[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:01.320]
Really?

[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:02.240]
I got a big reem.

[01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:04.600]
Because I think the grim reemer is going to become any minute.

[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:06.400]
Now, this story you just asked me,

[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:08.680]
which you noticed it was sent to Whispery from the University of Dives.

[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:32.480]
Go for it.

[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:32.960]
Go for it.

[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:33.060]
Go for it.

[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:33.060]

[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:33.060]

[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:33.060]

[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:33.060]

[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:33.060]

[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:33.060]

[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:33.060]

[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:33.060]

[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:33.060]

[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:33.060]

[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:33.060]

[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:33.060]

[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:33.060]

[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:33.060]

[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:33.060]

[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:33.060]

[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:33.060]

[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:33.060]

[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:33.060]

[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:33.060]

[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:33.060]

[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:33.060]

[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:33.060]

[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:33.160]
Go for it.

[01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:33.200]
Go for it.

[01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:35.380]
Go for it.

[01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:38.640]
Go for it.

[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:39.280]
Go for it.

[01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:39.900]
Go for it.

[01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:41.520]
And a show about the aggressive management we got.

[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:43.620]
Here's the story that they passed me from Down the Street,

[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:44.600]
where the MOOCow is.

[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:47.360]
Broward County Commissioner has finalized an agreement today that

[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:51.560]
makes WIOD 610, the County's official emergency information

[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:53.480]
radio station during hurricanes.

[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:54.400]
What?

[01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:56.120]
WIOD.

[01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:57.280]
I hate that stage.

[01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:58.020]
Inside that.

[01:11:58.440 --> 01:11:59.480]
Remember this last Wilma.

[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:02.940]
And I volunteered to work on the day when we really had

[01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:07.020]
the big blow. Right. And he said, well, we don't know if we're going to bring anybody

[01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:10.520]
in there who can work the board that day. And I mean, I couldn't have done the show on

[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:14.480]
that Monday. It was a Monday. I'll never forget it. And so the game ended today off.

[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:19.120]
Yeah. I could have worked. I mean, there was no hurricane here. We just find some with

[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:23.800]
shining black squirrels who run around. By the way, we ever seen black squirrels? Sure.

[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:28.380]
Where was that all over the place? Really? Here in North Carolina. I've never seen any

[01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:33.380]
Florida. Here we got like a whole bunch of black squirrels. Anyway, the 24-hour news

[01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:37.060]
station's agreed to broadcast all of Browards media briefings and emergency announcements

[01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:41.740]
during a hurricane. They'll also promote hurricane and emergency preparation events on the

[01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:45.580]
air for the county. In exchange, the station will be promoted as the official emergency

[01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:50.460]
news outlet and all of Browards hurricane materials such as preparation guides sent to the public.

[01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:55.340]
Because so many people are with electricity after major storm, they'll depend on radio

[01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:59.120]
news. The agreement will make the station one of the most listened to broadcast outlets

[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:02.380]
following a storm. The commissioners will vote on their agreement if they're meeting

[01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:05.360]
today. It's in fact, in fact, their meeting air there. It's already a done deal 10

[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:10.600]
o'clock this morning. It's a sign sealed delivered. How do you like that, huh? So my

[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:14.680]
point I make it is that if we have an hurricane this year that hits out Florida, we have

[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:19.360]
let's hope not, but a will-mo-like situation. I'm not working those days. What's the

[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:23.940]
point? Yeah. When you agree? I don't think any of us should. No. It was just layout.

[01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:29.320]
We just probably have a golf game to play in a rain. Something like that. Because what's

[01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:32.700]
the point? We don't want to compete and bring. We sit back. Well, we don't know anything

[01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:36.760]
about news and we don't really have that's not up our alley. And what does that have

[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:42.040]
to do with sports anyhow? Oh, Jesus. Remember what I was saying? Is that a piece of any

[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:46.760]
kind of national emergency or local emergency who retains terrorist attacks? This would

[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:50.740]
be one of the last days most people would turn to. Not because of this show, but because

[01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:54.160]
of the fact that what does it have to do with sports just like on 9-11 and there's the

[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:58.500]
squeaky ones in. What would we say about it? We got to talk sports. Why do we want to

[01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:02.000]
interrupt our program? What are we going to say about it? While the planes were hitting

[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.740]
the world trade center, this little silly ass tour was sitting there squeal and crap. And

[01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:10.700]
took us like an hour and a half before we finally got the common sense to put the TV

[01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:15.160]
sound audio on there and let public know what that was going on. That thing to me, that

[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:19.240]
was the epitome. When you say sports bar with a microphone, I would say irresponsible

[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:25.940]
sports bar with a microphone. Even in a sports bar, they probably turned on CNN on 9-11

[01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:29.020]
when you think so. I would have thought. If they were hanging out in the bar that early

[01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:32.140]
in the day, I would have think so. They probably turned on the certainly not news network

[01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:36.360]
to see what that was going on as opposed to going like, what a being going to say about

[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:42.740]
it. What a simple demand. What an assimpering idiot. But you know, he's part of that

[01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:47.340]
trumpet there. He, Robert Creeper and Clarence are doing some three ways and once they're

[01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:52.160]
on the beast kind of piles on. So anyway, you saw that movie with, I don't think you

[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:55.580]
did see the one I was talking about with Rob Lowe and James Spader. That influence.

[01:14:56.240 --> 01:15:00.560]
I didn't think I saw it part of it. Never. Yeah, it was pretty interesting. Except for

[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:05.420]
the ending was as usual. No decent movie, bad ending. Lot of movies. They need to work

[01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:10.220]
it out of flesh. Yeah. All you despros out there, there was Rob Lowe's ass.

[01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:17.300]
Right. Oh, man. Not a big deal. Believe me. A small ass. But a lot of nudity. You'd like

[01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:22.940]
that. But and a good storyline about how Rob Lowe, we never do find out though why he's

[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:26.480]
decided to do this. You know what? That's kind of looked up in the air. Why he's like

[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:31.600]
decided to invade James Spader's life and just pretty much taken over the whole deal.

[01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:35.480]
The best season in the home movie though, when they're having the reception, James Spader

[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:39.500]
and his fiancee and here's they're all dressed up in tuxedo's and it's a very formal occasion

[01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:43.060]
and all these stuffy people are there and the prospective father-in-law is there in the

[01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:48.540]
whole family. The Gonsumish Fah and Rob Lowe's sticks in the VCR. A tapie made of James Spader,

[01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:52.480]
nailing this bra that he hooked him up with the night before and he's got the videotape

[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:57.220]
and he just happens to pop in there and they're all screaming in the father-in-law's chasing

[01:15:57.220 --> 01:16:01.260]
him down the street. You were son of a bitch. Yeah, it's great. Well, he wanted to emancipate

[01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:04.240]
him from this cell that he was going to get married to. I'm sure you don't even understand

[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:12.700]
that. No. That's a true friend. Well, I'm looking at the clock boys and girls and looks

[01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:17.660]
like 20 till noon to May. Looks like 1140 in North America in the Eastern time zone to

[01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:21.720]
May, Eastern daylight time and I don't hear any, you're shrying out in here any clapping

[01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:25.180]
out here. Hey, hey, hey, you're screaming. I heard nothing. You ain't got nothing yet?

[01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:29.880]
Nothing yet. I ain't seen nothing yet. Oh my God. Well, we better do the break because

[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:34.740]
when we come back, I might have piles here. This is Neil Rodger. You're an old idea,

[01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:42.860]
Roma. This is 5.62.8. I think it's hard to think.

[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:49.000]
Hey, you're doing great because it's not in your child's equate. Okay. Not the world,

[01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:55.740]
baby. I love you, Trump. I love you, two babies, but just stay quiet, okay? I said

[01:16:55.740 --> 01:17:00.320]
quiet. You're not able to get anywhere in your child's age. They know it hurts. Trump

[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:02.640]
ain't left. Okay. I know you want me to be quiet.

[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:14.420]
I'm not going to be quiet again. Show them. Show them. Show them. I told you to show them

[01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:22.820]
by the way I have to do that. I said show them. Okay, so this is not the first grade.

[01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:27.260]
This is some other grab. Now, how's that possible? No. Well, they just now handed me hot

[01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:31.040]
off the presses. The 12 plus. Are they smiling or are they frowning? Are they like

[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:34.440]
beating the chains? Is that bivalent? So I don't know if you even looked at them.

[01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:38.800]
Ambivalent? What is your 12 plus? I mean, too much. You want me to waste your paper with

[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:41.540]
them? Oh, yeah. I want everything in there. Come on. It's all because this is the book.

[01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:47.560]
This is the book. And you know what the Lord said? The good book tells you that, yeah,

[01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:50.920]
don't forget it's not important that we succeed, but that the people we don't like fail.

[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:55.460]
Now, here's the story. You just facts me in a false alarm that I thought here comes the

[01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:59.500]
first page. Man, this was exciting. I'm I state the wrong position here. Karen McDonald,

[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:03.500]
the mother charged with snatching 11 year old son in fling the country told a judge Monday

[01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:09.040]
that she feared her ex her gay ex husband was trying to turn their son gay. How do you do that?

[01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:12.400]
Looks like that boy's building. We got her. Remember? McDonald's who made the statement when

[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:15.800]
a jury was out of the courtroom during her third day of trial has admitted that she abducted

[01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:20.700]
her son from a brown preps school in 2001 and fled with him to Costa Rica. An artist

[01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:24.300]
not living in Key West. She depended on her actions by alleging that she did so because of her ex

[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:29.060]
husband's gay lifestyle. The jury was removed from the courtroom as the judge decided what

[01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:32.980]
portions of her testimony, including details about her ex husband's sexual past would be heard by the

[01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:37.220]
jury. Later when the jury returned, McDonald talked about how during their marriage she suspected

[01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:42.640]
he was gay, described how he started wearing tight-fitting clothes and looked a little gay. Not

[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:47.760]
very gay. He looked a little gay, you know, like medium gay. Yeah. I didn't understand how

[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:52.520]
somebody can be straight and then be gay, she said shaking her head. McDonald's faces up to five

[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:56.580]
years in prison of convicted. Painted herself as a devoted wife who cared for her husband. They

[01:18:56.580 --> 01:19:00.980]
murdered an 80- and four-lawed real 89. She discovered she was pruggling. They divorced in 97.

[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:05.660]
The hero was unsuccessful in reaching her husband's lawyer last night. McDonald wearing a crisp blue

[01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:10.780]
business suit and her hair pulled back in a dip. In court described for the jury how her son told

[01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:14.680]
her about a man and her father's home cooking pancakes for breakfast while wearing pajamas.

[01:19:15.180 --> 01:19:20.400]
At first her son liked her father's lover Carlos Diaz but she said that later a son told her

[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:26.580]
that he hated Diaz and that Diaz had massaged him on his buttocks several times. Oh no.

[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:30.860]
The allegation became part of the custody battle in the courtroom garden for the boy in 2001

[01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:34.620]
recommended that Diaz could not have contact with the boy and yet again. So, you know,

[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:40.900]
one of those stories in the naked city. Okay, here we go. 12 plus boys and girls. Here we go.

[01:30:13.140 --> 01:30:17.580]
security or something I don't know huh I've already sent authorized agents on the hallway to try to

[01:30:17.580 --> 01:30:22.120]
track the numbers down what is that that quick the puking out the stuff a long time ago

[01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:26.720]
and you and I both know that's not the way those numbers come down man it's like an assembly line

[01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:32.460]
they keep puking and puking and puking and come down as the word yeah anyway man I'll tell you that

[01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:37.180]
number they're at night that that's as close to being off the air as it's physically possible a

[01:30:37.180 --> 01:30:43.180]
0.4 wow rice limbaugh declared victory yesterday is long running fight to clear his name after

[01:30:43.180 --> 01:30:47.460]
signing a deal with prosecutors that'll dismiss a prescription fraud charge against him in 18 months

[01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:52.120]
if he can plug applies with the terms slap on a wrist under the deal filed yesterday he cannot

[01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:56.360]
own a gun must submit to random drug test and as to continue to refer his acknowledgment to

[01:30:56.360 --> 01:31:01.040]
painkillers he's pop it up and probably can't talk to Wilma no more either but he did not have

[01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:06.380]
to admit guilt and continues to proclaim his innocence on his radio show he's just you know I'm

[01:31:06.380 --> 01:31:11.180]
misunderstood guy that says everybody else who gets hooked on drugs is a slime ball in a piece of

[01:31:11.180 --> 01:31:15.720]
crap and on a beyond death row but in his case he had a back problem you know maybe I can get some

[01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:21.100]
of those what's that was he popping oxy oxy man get some oxy's from my shoulder you think that

[01:31:21.100 --> 01:31:27.340]
would help yeah it would help I'd tell you what I'm not sure what where is the rest of the book

[01:31:27.340 --> 01:31:31.600]
but Miguel came in here to ask to look at my copy of the numbers and I didn't have any and he ran

[01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:37.100]
out to find our copy of the numbers yeah has not been able to find that's the same

[01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:41.080]
girl that didn't more give me the number and how much we raised the maturity thing oh I forgot to ask

[01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:44.980]
out of sight something's coming across my machine now did they send it yeah but it's not the numbers

[01:31:44.980 --> 01:31:50.480]
just some crap just some crap right sir there's another false alarm that's too like it about 20

[01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:57.880]
minutes two false alarms oh man holy look at the look at the length of this facts yeah I'd

[01:31:57.880 --> 01:32:02.300]
other kill enough time for those numbers to show up it says it ething figures the government chooses

[01:32:02.300 --> 01:32:06.540]
their radio stage new transmitter and studios are co-located on a damn island in the middle of the bay

[01:32:06.540 --> 01:32:10.240]
what happens when the big one comes right in through downtown Miami from the east

[01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:15.920]
w-i-d will be in the north i wall with the worst winds in storm surge I was in country walk

[01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:19.840]
during Andrew and remember seeing the huge concrete power poles being pushed over and the

[01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:24.360]
channel six tv tower in a twisted heap in the middle of a grove in south bay if I'm not mistaken I

[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:28.420]
saw report a few years back about the condition of the w-i-d tower and it wasn't pretty that is

[01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:33.240]
correct metal towers don't respond well to extreme marine environments that the w-i-d tower is

[01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:38.400]
subject to is sitting in if it were up to me I would set up something like your situation you

[01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:42.340]
would have the sufficient infrastructure to provide rapid and concise information without having

[01:32:42.340 --> 01:32:46.960]
to worry about adverse conditions it amazes me that not one government member is why the

[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:50.740]
response was so poor in New York immediately after the attacks on on 11 the leadership up

[01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:55.400]
they're looking only for prestige placed all of the assets in one place the main radio transmission

[01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:59.960]
set an emergency operation center were both in the w-i-d-tc the world trade center when they lost

[01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:03.680]
that they were screwed as we will be trying to get information they were a cancer that I laid

[01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:07.320]
out comes about that's right see if I could just keep these things on here because I got my

[01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:11.900]
cable here I got my internet to just like I had during Wilma I could have been on here that day

[01:33:11.900 --> 01:33:16.540]
puking out some pretty important crap find out about the closings and the coordinates and the

[01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:22.520]
this and that you know given people reason to tune in but no because we didn't want to risk anybody's

[01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:26.080]
life and limb having them come in here who we had somebody come in but the deal was he didn't know

[01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:29.940]
how to run the board well enough to put the show on here that was the story that was out

[01:33:29.940 --> 01:33:36.060]
ready for that okay I was ready willing and able but of course being out of touch I mean with

[01:33:36.060 --> 01:33:40.880]
how what I've known about hurricane Wilma right that's correct 1170 votes on the pool we don't

[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:44.120]
start getting some more numbers in there with them out next to the two or three minutes I'm going to

[01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:48.680]
Joe and Clarence locked themselves in Clarence's office with the numbers well said well what

[01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:53.400]
does that mean it means just what I said they locked themselves into other words they're not going

[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:57.160]
to give me the numbers for the first time in a hundred years and with a witness unlike 18 different

[01:33:57.160 --> 01:34:01.300]
radio stations I don't think you were anybody else well that you know I'm telling you what that is

[01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:06.300]
right now oh we're fine I think it's unacceptable what it is they locked themselves in maybe they're

[01:34:06.300 --> 01:34:12.620]
doing something in there with the numbers no with some number 1170 votes on a pool how did illegal

[01:34:12.620 --> 01:34:19.860]
alien they affect you not at all 841 72% not at all like me didn't bother my ass much less traffic

[01:34:19.860 --> 01:34:27.660]
196 spent extra money 59 didn't go to work 21 I hate this pool 18 didn't go shopping 14 didn't

[01:34:27.660 --> 01:34:33.500]
open my business 12 dose I think it's what I got a bad dose worse traffic than usual nine and

[01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:38.080]
didn't go to school none none well good for you kids we don't have any kids anyway so what's the

[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:43.740]
deal I have an update yes they're making copies as we speak but the chin right out of papers so

[01:34:43.740 --> 01:34:52.740]
another ready I got I got I got paper I got paper and my team read out of paper what what kind

[01:34:52.740 --> 01:35:03.720]
of oh my god even under the old regime and the book would come up see I would have played a

[01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:07.860]
fart sound every we can't do that no more no and we're paying a wicked price for that too man I

[01:35:07.860 --> 01:35:11.880]
hope you're real happy joys that you really like suppressing the audience our ability to get any

[01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:16.180]
numbers yeah which even your new general man was said that terrible try to tell them that try to

[01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:21.320]
do a show with our hands tied behind our back man can't play this and we can't say that we can't

[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:27.260]
do why because they're incompetent because the banjo boy group ink is totally incompetent

[01:35:27.260 --> 01:35:30.940]
and they're scared of their own shadow and the fact that they're locked in there right now why the

[01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:36.160]
hell are they may who's making copies don't tell me carabell's making copies I don't know how to do

[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:42.200]
these head I don't know what's going on out there can we get like a spy report can we go head

[01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:47.020]
out the door there and yeah stick your head out okay stick the head out if anybody grabs for

[01:35:47.020 --> 01:35:52.720]
you know it will be duff you fairy it's running out there it's running out near a hall get the chop

[01:35:55.040 --> 01:36:01.260]
I didn't see anybody making copies unless they went down to the yeah this is the biggest

[01:36:01.260 --> 01:36:06.580]
production and they can only postpone the inevitable so long you know because if they don't

[01:36:06.580 --> 01:36:11.020]
want to turn those numbers loose look at him from someplace else then we had to do that one

[01:36:11.020 --> 01:36:15.060]
other time we got that I remember what that was we got but yeah we'll get him by hooker by crook

[01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:20.980]
so quit holding back okay they must be really bad if they're like you know play and fast and lose

[01:36:21.460 --> 01:36:26.680]
like the old kaboos between abandoned hoobles says apparently when Republicans were urging

[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:31.040]
Americans to get tough on crime they were doing it to protect us from themselves just last

[01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:35.640]
week Carol Rowland back to testify the grand jury for the fifth time we learned that the FBI is

[01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:39.540]
investigating the possible bribing by two defense contractors representative Duke Cunningham

[01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:45.000]
another on named lawmakers with free prostitutes there was my old emphasis rush limbaugh like most

[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:49.020]
bullies limbaugh who still finds it funny to refer into hurricane Katrina as hurricane Katrina

[01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:53.020]
vanden hoobles is better with dishing out the pain than taking it he was arrested on Friday in

[01:36:53.020 --> 01:36:56.960]
charge with prescription drug fraud or felony for buying two thousand paint killers prescribed by

[01:36:56.960 --> 01:37:01.060]
four different doctors in a six month period but all what a difference in a rest makes in the

[01:37:01.060 --> 01:37:05.080]
past rush argue that drug users ought to be accused and they ought to be convicted they ought to

[01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:09.980]
be sent up instead of going to jail however limbaugh accepted the L.A. request and to pay a $30,000

[01:37:09.980 --> 01:37:15.800]
fine and serve 18 months of supervised probation to make sure he continues his treatment for drug addiction

[01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:19.740]
some are expressed sympathy for limbaugh but before anybody writes a check of his defense fund think

[01:37:19.740 --> 01:37:24.240]
about the distraught person who drives the short straw and is stuck supervising the blow hard for 18

[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:28.700]
months talk about a job no american wants maybe some of the illegals can take that job to provide the

[01:37:28.700 --> 01:37:36.380]
rush they'll do it and you'll share his oxies with you okay neither that so what's the story

[01:37:36.380 --> 01:37:40.660]
there is no story got a staff right here I'm feeding them into the she's got a stack while he's

[01:37:40.660 --> 01:37:45.940]
talking about 54 she's just carrying a whole game it to you clearance clearance somebody to you or he

[01:37:45.940 --> 01:37:51.660]
looked like because somebody just stole his periket it he didn't look happy didn't look happy

[01:37:51.660 --> 01:37:55.820]
can't imagine why I've seen these 12 plus numbers and what did I what did I tell you before

[01:37:55.820 --> 01:38:00.180]
the show went on here this morning what did I say to you huh yeah and what did I tell him what

[01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:06.200]
did I say to our junior program director what did I say yeah these people think that we just open

[01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:10.200]
up the microphone and make some pulsing sounds in the transmitter and all of a sudden everybody in

[01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:14.240]
the world is going to be listening I realize that this is a very ethnically and ethnically driven book

[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:18.620]
there's no question about that the diaries fell in a lot of uh you know spow-in-sko hands there's no

[01:38:18.620 --> 01:38:23.860]
question about that but that having been said when you look at those numbers there man it's

[01:38:23.860 --> 01:38:30.320]
enough to make a grown man cry ain't it yes it is my me dolphins lined back her Jason Taylor was

[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:33.860]
cut on the arm during that we had that yesterday Taylor refused medical treatment issue

[01:38:33.860 --> 01:38:37.600]
disdainment from Tampa yesterday morning where he was participating in that charity golf tournament

[01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:42.260]
they me police gave an account of what happened based on their interview with Taylor and they got

[01:38:42.260 --> 01:38:47.380]
a picture of this this is one of what when did this spaceship land Taylor and his wife were

[01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:51.580]
driving south to the intersection of state road 84 flamingo road when he saw a red Ford pickup truck

[01:38:51.580 --> 01:38:55.840]
backing up in a wrong direction heading directly toward the couples car Taylor honked his horn

[01:38:55.840 --> 01:39:00.900]
but the car kept backing up at about 10 MPH the driver tried to sorbure on Taylor's car forcing

[01:39:00.900 --> 01:39:06.020]
the sports star to run off the road in the grass both vehicles stopped at south west 130th Avenue

[01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:10.200]
eight street Taylor got out of his car the truck driver also got out and banged on Taylor's trunk

[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:15.600]
the other driver screamed profanities threats and racial slurs at Taylor now I got news for

[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:21.900]
how he can scream racial slurs at Jason Taylor he's maybe one shade darker than this guy he's

[01:39:21.900 --> 01:39:26.640]
about as light as not even mocha Taylor told police that the man grabbed and ripped his shirt and

[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:30.620]
retrieved an unknown metal object from inside his truck and tented a cut Taylor with a linebacker

[01:39:30.620 --> 01:39:34.960]
stepped away what was cut as forearm let me ask you something Josh why would he step away when he

[01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:39.580]
just kick his ass I don't know I would have big guy would have Jason Taylor man a big macho guy

[01:39:39.580 --> 01:39:44.820]
like that big ass-kickin guy could have picked him up with one hand the other driver got back into

[01:39:44.820 --> 01:39:48.020]
his truck which was carrying another man in drove away Taylor followed him in dialed 911

[01:39:48.020 --> 01:39:52.880]
one by law track of the truck somewhere near a trailer a trailer park in Davy the he took

[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:58.080]
this later arrested Charles Redman Burns 25 at his home in Davy he would charge with aggravated

[01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:02.960]
batteries a hate crime and resisting arrest police said Burns punched and kicked the officer

[01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:06.660]
trying to handcuff him when he tried to kick out the winner of the police car the officer was

[01:40:06.660 --> 01:40:11.580]
sprayed in twice in the face with pepper spray and it was taken to Brown County jail man classy looking

[01:40:12.460 --> 01:40:16.260]
okay so did you look at these it already just no no I just stuffed them right in the other words

[01:40:16.260 --> 01:40:19.720]
you don't have a strong enough stomach to look at him that's a deal and I know what I know

[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:23.920]
it would have been delayed if I had stopped to look at them I just think you don't have enough

[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:31.900]
stomach I gotta do the break yeah men 25 to 54 and parents didn't look happy huh oh man more ethnic

[01:44:53.700 --> 01:44:54.340]
Oh, I...

[01:44:56.200 --> 01:45:00.020]
Money pass note of QAM, here to be great, Glenn Turner, used to be great here at QAM.

[01:45:00.020 --> 01:45:04.960]
Let me just say one thing. I absolutely want a puke. That's all. That's all I want to say. I absolutely want a puke.

[01:45:05.060 --> 01:45:10.840]
So, how do you get those morning numbers or what? I think I fact some. No, you did not fact some. Oh, just now.

[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:16.960]
Well, I've taken a little moment to get here. Wow. And when you see who's number one in midday, and if you took a look at it...

[01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:22.480]
I did not in men. WFLC, the coast. Oh, yeah. Of course. All the men were playing the coast.

[01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:27.660]
All the men were playing the coast. This is the most screwed up rating book I have ever seen. Somebody ought to go to Arbor Trial and murder a bunch of people.

[01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:33.540]
I think that's the only way we're ever going to get to the bottom. I'm not saying that we are really sucking wind because I told you that before. Right.

[01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:39.360]
But, I mean, this is just all over the place. I mean, every day part. Killsle people. There you go. That might do it.

[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:48.600]
The coast from 9th to number one with a 7.5. All the men. How many wire diaries? How many a thousand wire diaries?

[01:45:48.880 --> 01:45:54.780]
I'm a break. The other guys would like to listen to that during their construction jobs and what. Right. Those Michael Bolton records. Right.

[01:45:55.300 --> 01:46:00.780]
Followed by CM Qnospeling Lays and Big. Oh, Big got some kisses to an air in a hot. And we're number five.

[01:46:01.140 --> 01:46:06.440]
At least from 10 to 3. 10 to 2. We might actually slip up an after two, but not much. Forget about spending money.

[01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:13.620]
I'm going to tell you if we get about a bonus money because you ain't going to see any. Yeah. The full bonus half bonus part bonus, little bonus, the honest.

[01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:19.300]
So let's see how the other guys did midday. Well, let's see those guys across the street with that great humor of theirs.

[01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:24.780]
They went zooming up from a 1.70 1.8. They're on the move, baby. And the.

[01:46:24.780 --> 01:46:31.020]
The scare America mid days went from a 2.6 year in a fall to a 1.5 fell off the face of the globe.

[01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:36.560]
If you believe that afternoon drive, we got that we still don't have mornings. Very interested in seeing that.

[01:46:37.900 --> 01:46:42.580]
Mornings. You see, like I told you before, they don't want to listen to anything. I have to save them. Okay.

[01:46:42.860 --> 01:46:46.600]
They wouldn't listen before. They won't listen now and they're stubborn. They know what all they're going to do.

[01:46:47.260 --> 01:46:53.760]
So like I told you, just take the money is your machine done. Puking. It's not doing anything. All right. Let me try this again.

[01:46:54.300 --> 01:46:58.400]
Why didn't come through? Apparently not. Didn't come through on this end. Maybe might have seen.

[01:46:58.520 --> 01:47:04.340]
Doesn't want those more numbers. Maybe maybe it just is like maybe it's boycotting. Maybe it's a bad numbered boycott day.

[01:47:05.020 --> 01:47:14.000]
Three to seven PM and 25 to 54 are coveted target demographic. WQM has dropped from ninth in the previous book with a 3.7, which was pretty weak to a 2.4.

[01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:22.860]
Nineteenth. They grow that per sheet. It's wrong. Oh. Nothing's coming yet. Why actually before they start looking their chops in the afternoon, you know what?

[01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:31.380]
Dandelion bastard and Stugas in at all their heavy hitters. They'd run from a 3.1 to a 1.7. This is enough to make Sid the kid Rosenberg's crantstein hop in a car and leave town.

[01:47:31.820 --> 01:47:38.120]
It's enough to make me do it. That's right. Left already. What about scare America there in the afternoon? How they doing all from a 3.5 to a 2.7?

[01:47:40.380 --> 01:47:46.540]
And WYOD remember how they were kicking ass in a fall. That's right. Because it was the hurricane Wilma book. Oh, you just made that up as an excuse.

[01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:55.460]
They've ran from a 5.9 from number one in the fall to a 3.6. Number nine here. But again, this isn't just so ethnically screwed up. It just it just it doesn't make any sense.

[01:47:56.080 --> 01:48:05.160]
It's like these diaries were made up by bunch of kids with crayons. Crayolas number one at night in man WDR from a 5.8 in the fall to a 9.4 share at night.

[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:16.320]
They are kicking some serious dark ass. Hot 105 number 275. Scar America. That's a big numbers at night. The rest of the day they sucked wind. Why is this thing not printing anything out? I don't know.

[01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:18.460]
Now just leave. Oh.

[01:48:27.220 --> 01:48:31.520]
Well, nothing's happening on it. I'm just telling you that for your benefits. You might want to do it again. All right.

[01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:41.600]
Now what that was I just reading. I was reading those night reading and weep. Seven to midnight. Waxi went up from a 1.5 to a 2.1. What the hell got out of night?

[01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:51.420]
January, February, March. What the hell would they have on at night? Kevin Rogers. Well, they probably confuse him with. And we went from a 2.1 to a 0.7.

[01:48:53.100 --> 01:48:58.060]
I'll tell you what. We've been on the station for almost eight and a half years. And then I've period of time. I don't recall any rating book.

[01:48:58.060 --> 01:49:08.180]
We're in our target demographic. There was any day part that began with a. Oh, no. This is a record breaking book. We are starting to come right down to the level of the competition across the street.

[01:49:08.180 --> 01:49:29.560]
We're getting in there with the 0.0.0.1.1.2. And Laurence Welk. I wanted to welcome the Laurence Welk radio. So our 4.8 there in men, which is a 5.0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1

[01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:59.480]
I'm going to get three copies of it now.

[01:50:00.460 --> 01:50:11.220]
Because what really frustrates me is when you're dealing with people who are hard-ass, who obviously on the face of it don't know they're asked from your elbow and just give you a big son of dance to try to pacify and pacify.

[01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:16.380]
And you tell them things and it's like that they're just common sense even a child could see. And they won't listen to you.

[01:50:16.580 --> 01:50:26.180]
And I love that people in the audience work for idiots too. But we work for a special brand of idiots. I mean these people are just like what do I tell you? Suspended animation man. They're like helpless and hopeless.

[01:50:26.700 --> 01:50:32.200]
Here come those morning numbers. Why did you say the first page was wrong? I don't know because Miguel said that's wrong.

[01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:36.520]
It is? Well I guess we stopped it in time.

[01:50:37.100 --> 01:50:50.200]
No big. I'll see this one. Ron and Old Paul. Everybody's got a shot except us. Everybody's got a story somewhere. From 64 to 1.91. I have never seen a book with more wired diaries. And of course that all had to be in the last month in March.

[01:50:50.920 --> 01:51:03.860]
How one oh five number two with an a five radio on more continues to astonish and astound W. X. D. J. C. M. Q. F. M. A. Now let's see where the stations that care about magic three out of a two nine like I said Rick you put the cat back on.

[01:51:04.580 --> 01:51:11.660]
He's flat old flat top I. O. D. from a five three out of a two nine anybody was speaking in grace man we took it right up the old earlobe.

[01:51:12.140 --> 01:51:23.840]
I'm still looking here all boy what I thought too bad to five down to with two one in the morning. Not great we dropped from a five out of a four eight during the 10 to three that is right.

[01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:36.380]
What was that number again to one in the morning. How about a waxy two four down to a one six so I told you it's not important that we succeed that our enemies across the street failed badly nice going Joel.

[01:51:36.380 --> 01:51:47.080]
We saw me to suffer worse this is five sixty two. Anybody have a heart or a liver.

[01:51:49.300 --> 01:52:06.360]
MTV presents from night life yeah baby from the ship. Chris I love carnations as much as I love a root canal to the limo I've never kissed a guy at least not there to the late night bar for rambo.

[01:52:06.360 --> 01:52:14.460]
I got a book tomorrow over my dress and TV's from night life in my show.

[01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:17.040]

[01:52:20.860 --> 01:52:29.080]
1232 at five sixty W. N. Q. A. Anybody out there sent us a life rat please yeah anybody out there can you hear us.

[01:52:30.140 --> 01:52:39.980]
Wow a shocker. Nice going Joe you're really doing it baby. I think this whole deal with what's happened in the last few months it's been like career ending for all of us.

[01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:48.280]
I noticed the human in the morning dropped almost in half and also in the afternoon precipitously our human down a little bit but nothing really tragic you know not a big change.

[01:52:48.280 --> 01:52:57.940]
But our drive times man when and of course what can I say Hank what we ought to be on the third day won't be on Friday he's off to the Derby he's got bigger face to fry.

[01:52:58.960 --> 01:53:01.900]
Gellies on tomorrow and on Thursday and on Friday.

[01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:16.380]
Let's see who else can we put how about if we put Lady Martez and Crow in that committee you know the little committee of children that run a radio station how about if we did that okay yeah we got Robert the beast clearance Crow and Lenny.

[01:53:16.380 --> 01:53:32.600]
I can sit around like in the conference room we have a committee meeting and then they can pass the recommendations on to Joe and he'll say okay good idea boys from 114 votes on our pool to them so sorry man I'm so sorry that I went out a lot with the damage by one number that 15 million could have added years to my life yeah.

[01:53:32.600 --> 01:53:44.420]
And what did I tell you you don't want to listen to me months ago what did I say to you when his new regime came in there and I said boy don't give me a big sound of dance because what I'm seeing don't look good to me when I'm hearing don't sound good to me.

[01:53:45.280 --> 01:53:45.640]
Clueless.

[01:53:46.400 --> 01:54:13.340]
1215 votes how did illegal alien day effect you yesterday huh not at all 869 71.5% much less traffic 205 spend extra money 62 just out of spite spend a lot more than usual just to show these back to the thing or two these illegals didn't go to work 23 I hate this full 21 didn't go shopping 14 didn't open my business 12 worst traffic than usual nine and didn't go to school we still got the big.

[01:54:14.860 --> 01:54:19.840]
I got a headache that is so just it's just started like a few minutes ago well I've had one all day.

[01:54:20.260 --> 01:54:26.940]
Starting at the top of my sinus cavity and extending all the way down into my like eye sockets you know I thought you were going to say all the way down to your back.

[01:54:26.940 --> 01:54:28.300]
No not that way.

[01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:33.640]
Well it's working as way down as it done your sign yeah for seniors are singing working my way back through you.

[01:54:35.060 --> 01:54:36.760]
What's this back to this and me.

[01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:43.680]
Oh this is why your ratings are so bad radio stations that got bad ratings news have a convenient scapegoats as the New York.

[01:54:43.940 --> 01:54:49.500]
Post a new arbitrar policy that appears to give major boost to Spanish language stations expensive others.

[01:54:49.700 --> 01:54:51.820]
Uh huh how do you like that I know what I'm.

[01:54:53.520 --> 01:55:03.560]
In yesterday's winner ratings New York's La Megas shout out 25% from the fall to rank a solid number two after light FM with a 5.6% total audio and share that's an.

[01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:11.180]
New York or 5.6% of the audience represents a lot of people even more noticeable was the fact that I'm more lead product from 10th place.

[01:55:11.180 --> 01:55:17.020]
You were go to 4th yesterday with a whopping 41% year to year gain and a 4.5 share.

[01:55:17.340 --> 01:55:26.140]
These new ethnic rating survey enhancements will provide a better picture of ethnic and non ethnic listening and reduced bounce said arbitrarians Gary Marrins referring to often criticized.

[01:55:26.140 --> 01:55:33.360]
Rating fluctuations from survey to survey that Spanish station game will come out of the English language stations consultant Bill Tanner.

[01:55:33.480 --> 01:55:40.360]
You fair told inside radio before arbitrarians winner ratings began rolling out nationwide yesterday indeed for what a.

[01:55:40.460 --> 01:55:47.900]
And this guy's also supposed to be one of our consultants is near is that the history I don't know yeah but of course keep it mighty consults for that group of Spanish language stations.

[01:55:48.100 --> 01:55:50.760]
That's right. Yeah he likes those young Mexicans.

[01:55:50.760 --> 01:56:04.040]
What I heard indeed for whatever reason five of the remaining top 10 stations saw ratings declines in the winner light FM kiss FM W.I.S. Power 105 and 97 Z 100 W.V.L.S. and W.A.V.C. were up.

[01:56:04.540 --> 01:56:11.160]
Starting last winter arbitrarian made two major changes to the way classifies ethnic family members to agree to a separate ease diaries for a week.

[01:56:11.160 --> 01:56:21.600]
It now no longer assumes that all members of a household are of the same race and number two it takes greater care to determine whether a family member is a Spanish primary or English primary language speaker and ways that

[01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:30.000]
accords with them according to the course on based on each city's ethnic makeup. And in other words they just read they read the read the whole way they they're

[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:40.700]
re-jiggered and re-figured lost it and we got triggered. Yeah so we're done what I tell you right off any bonuses future path that hold you see you'd have you deal science here

[01:56:40.700 --> 01:56:48.060]
right now but you're such a silly person. Oh well I want to get the full bonus for the summer here forget about bonus bonus bonus man you may

[01:56:48.060 --> 01:56:54.120]
speak it right language but our audience doesn't that's a problem okay maybe if you do the show this summer in Espanol maybe one maybe

[01:56:54.120 --> 01:57:01.060]
Monday in Espanol is the English and then Friday in Sanskrit in Spanish and for else voice. Oh that's a good idea good format.

[01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:12.800]
So what's the scuttle but what's going on around that building huh? Oh you know how it is when the numbers come out you don't see people they they retire into little corners to mall and use.

[01:57:13.020 --> 01:57:22.980]
Did you say we're car? I think I'm at too okay like our junior program director thinks that he's a radio maven okay not a bad guy nothing personal but he hasn't got a clue man.

[01:57:22.980 --> 01:57:30.100]
He thinks he can do whatever his boyfriend and when a general man where says you know well mode last two months he had a one share and this is before any ethnic

[01:57:30.100 --> 01:57:40.560]
changing around he had a one share in between two and four. Which we never dreamed we could get number that low so you know we figured well there's no hurry to replace it because we can't go any lower than that.

[01:57:40.660 --> 01:57:48.940]
That's really aggressive good management the way I look at it let's just keep put fun little long and fun little long and had no consistency which of course consistency is the

[01:57:48.940 --> 01:57:56.660]
byword in his business and in the television business there's a comfort zone even with people who aren't all that good like Ralph Redneck look at all the years he was on TV

[01:57:56.980 --> 01:58:02.700]
because people were used to watching him on the news at six o'clock and I read about that you bet your sweet ass I think you're worth work.

[01:58:02.860 --> 01:58:10.780]
And what we got is inconsistent you know yesterday Hank got wants to be a lot early we're going to put on a tape we're going to put on Orlando we're going to put on the beast for

[01:58:10.780 --> 01:58:26.400]
10 minutes we don't know even we don't know who else on the air on the station I got the schedule here front of me on Thursday in the morning TV D Friday TV D BB BB D to put on your BB D's and bring an extra pair because you'll need them I don't know what that means but that's what it says.

[01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:39.280]
A day that will live in infamy so you know we can sing a song and dance about the screwed up arbitra and all that but when you've been doing it as long as some of us old far to be doing you can feel it you can smell it and that's how I could feel I could smell it.

[01:58:39.280 --> 01:58:53.180]

[02:02:37.020 --> 02:02:42.000]
remember they had that big Wilma driven fall book with a 7.9 they were number one that's right well they

[02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:47.020]
dropped from number one to number eight we had a 4.8 they had a 3.9 so we kicked their ass and a good but

[02:02:47.020 --> 02:02:52.980]
again does anybody we believe that no no that everybody all of a sudden turn rush off and turned whatever else

[02:02:52.980 --> 02:02:58.000]
I was not so on a one hand there's certainly a very strong bogus element to this but you know what else it

[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:02.700]
proves that beyond the shadow of a doubt under this new system now you're not going to be able to afford to

[02:03:02.700 --> 02:03:08.300]
put schlock on 24 7 and get away with it even our loyal listeners you know even when they wire our

[02:03:08.300 --> 02:03:12.720]
diaries and you know try to do number for us they're up against it man they're up against the no

coast and how does that figure with big with Ron and old Paul every day where do they every now

[02:03:24.220 --> 02:03:28.060]
but where do they ever get off with the number like this with a 9 1 in the morning the number one in

[02:03:28.060 --> 02:03:33.100]
men in the morning elimination all in Ron process of elimination using old still material from us and

[02:03:33.100 --> 02:03:38.520]
everybody else the limit I think elimination is the word I think and the coast is number one in mid day the

[02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:44.400]

down with the Titanic having I've been saying that over and over again for last week for months now you

[02:04:18.100 --> 02:04:24.620]
can feel it man when the water's up to your earlobes you say hey there's something wrong going over here you say I'm dying

[02:04:52.760 --> 02:04:58.960]
award winning ready for you and if you like it find if not get out of here go listen to radio I'm more

[02:04:58.960 --> 02:05:05.020]
who listen to some CD crews records and what's really suspicious to me in this book is looks like all the

[02:05:05.020 --> 02:05:15.860]
team channel stations got there it is that's already ahead the same old gone I thought you were

[02:05:15.860 --> 02:05:24.900]
said that's enough look at all the team channel stations the coast and big and hot all I know that's I'm

[02:05:24.900 --> 02:05:31.040]
sorry coast and hot that's a cock stations cocks a hoist I like I said the cheap channel and cocks they got all the diaries

[02:05:31.040 --> 02:05:37.560]
so it looks like to me EDR there's another cocks station I think Mike Disney and a drunken super must have sold all the diaries

[02:05:37.560 --> 02:05:42.780]
maybe bottom come on now don't be picking on your old buddy he just he thought you were real piece of

[02:05:42.780 --> 02:05:49.580]
that's my opinion I might Disney okay go have another belt white lost or maybe they just got lucky you know like you

[02:05:49.580 --> 02:05:56.560]
said every dog has its day right right I don't buy that coast number at all that out who the hell would who the hell

[02:05:56.560 --> 02:06:01.680]
would from a 3.7 which sounds about right to me 9th you know kind of like down here in the toward the

[02:06:01.680 --> 02:06:07.280]
middle of the pack to number one with a 7.5 more than double more than double the audience from the fall to the

[02:06:07.280 --> 02:06:12.060]
winter time and don't tell me that they have a bunch of ethics listening to the coast your people sure is

[02:06:12.060 --> 02:06:17.840]
only listening to the clear not coast of it no either yours no that's for damn sure neither is anybody's

[02:06:17.840 --> 02:06:23.480]
you know whatever group you fall into even the Jews that go in there not listen to it the atheist

[02:06:23.480 --> 02:06:29.520]
worse you're not listening to it coast my ass right along this game they not that am tower down that's

[02:06:29.520 --> 02:06:36.440]
what I say and anyway you can argue about the sampling and about this and it is very suspect but the fact

[02:06:36.440 --> 02:06:41.480]
that matter remains man we got some real serious face to fry and these people seem like they're

[02:06:41.480 --> 02:06:46.960]
frozen man like they're in suspended animation like they can't move like they're paralyzed you know

[02:06:46.960 --> 02:06:53.980]
I just had that this morning again nothing is happening except the course which sounds real good to that

[02:06:53.980 --> 02:06:57.340]
Spanish language interference there on the radio when you're driving down 4 for 1 year and

[02:07:03.240 --> 02:07:08.720]
man I know I'd be tuned into that I'd be I'd be gripping my radio I'd be cranking it up I'd be

[02:07:08.720 --> 02:07:14.000]
driving around with my windows down just so everybody else could hear it wouldn't you oh yeah I do all the

[02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:18.400]
time no you don't oh yeah that's right and you want to man then you give us an intelligent

[02:07:18.400 --> 02:07:23.320]
report aside from Josh there we're saying well sometimes this is a Josh he just you know

[02:07:23.320 --> 02:07:27.180]
you know he just don't want to make any waves too big he's afraid he's going to drown in him what are

[02:07:27.180 --> 02:07:31.000]
you talking about I told you sometimes I hear the Spanish station sometimes I don't yeah and

[02:07:31.560 --> 02:07:36.540]
sometimes it's just as well sometimes you feel like a nut yeah and sometimes you feel like you

[02:07:36.540 --> 02:07:45.540]
work for one welcome to BBGI Banjo boy group ink okay it is absolutely shocking is what

[02:07:45.540 --> 02:07:51.480]
it is so in other words these people are going into hiding now oh I don't know I'm not leaving

[02:07:51.480 --> 02:07:57.320]
the studio here on Chris Matthews hardball last night MSNBC corresponded David Schuster confirmed

[02:07:57.320 --> 02:08:02.080]
what Ross Story website first reported in February that out at CIA officer Valerie

[02:08:02.080 --> 02:08:05.940]
Plain Wilson was working on Iran at the time she was outed according to current

[02:08:05.940 --> 02:08:10.620]
informer intelligence officials Plain Wilson to work on the clandestine clandestine side of the CIA

[02:08:10.620 --> 02:08:14.840]
and the directorate of operations is the non-official cover officer NOC was part of an

[02:08:14.840 --> 02:08:19.200]
operation tracking distribution and acquisition of weapons of mass destruction technology

[02:08:19.200 --> 02:08:25.160]
to and from Iran and of course once they outed her as a political smear and smear to Joe Wilson

[02:08:25.160 --> 02:08:29.000]
because they didn't like that off-head piece when he said everybody here they were lying about Iraq

[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:36.060]
and Niger Niger for the first time since Bush administration officials revealed her undercover identity

[02:08:36.060 --> 02:08:40.160]
and ruined her career former CIA operative Valerie Wilson committed by her husband Joe

[02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:43.480]
Stephen from the TV cameras and their red carpet appearance Saturday night at the White House

[02:08:43.480 --> 02:08:47.640]
correspondent center couldn't have come in a more dramatic moment in the CIA leak investigation

[02:08:48.220 --> 02:08:52.320]
and the fact of it is I'm not going to read the whole thing but since they outed her

[02:08:52.320 --> 02:08:57.280]
they've basically lost contact they don't know what else going on over there how do you like that

[02:08:57.280 --> 02:08:57.660]
uh...

[02:08:58.140 --> 02:09:03.960]
nice job there uh... w.a. in fact i see a tremendous similarity between w and r leadership here

[02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:04.760]
a qa and what you

[02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:06.380]
well that's an indictment

[02:09:06.380 --> 02:09:07.300]
well like i said

[02:09:07.300 --> 02:09:11.460]
and it's an unsealed amendment that we have to wait for pat Fitzgerald or even very

[02:09:11.460 --> 02:09:12.220]
Fitzgerald

[02:09:12.220 --> 02:09:14.720]
and if that doesn't trust your ass it up how about this

[02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:15.880]
i mentioned this before

[02:09:15.880 --> 02:09:19.780]
off-mede chalabee they never met a crook they didn't like these these of the bush

[02:09:19.780 --> 02:09:20.620]
are the bush crowd

[02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:24.500]
off-mede chalabee the man who will provide cooked intelligence out of right to the Pentagon

[02:09:24.500 --> 02:09:28.320]
and the new york times and lead up to the war is once again being engaged in u.s. policy this is

[02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:30.500]
the current and former u.s. intelligence officials be saying

[02:09:30.940 --> 02:09:36.060]
according to two former high-level counter intelligence officials one former senior counter terrorist officials and

[02:09:36.060 --> 02:09:37.360]
another intelligence or a fissure

[02:09:37.360 --> 02:09:41.320]
chalabee is acting as a broker between u.s. ambassador to rax zelma color law

[02:09:41.320 --> 02:09:45.860]
colla the odd and a rainy officials would have now stalled up a medic efforts between u.s. and aran

[02:09:46.300 --> 02:09:49.060]
chalabee inserted himself and brought a proposal to zeal

[02:09:49.060 --> 02:09:50.600]
one intelligence officer said

[02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:54.060]
this is the same guy who embezzled money in jordan

[02:09:54.060 --> 02:09:59.040]
and is wanted by the police this is the same guy who they ransacked his apartment because they

[02:09:59.040 --> 02:10:00.920]
suspected and sure rightfully so

[02:10:00.920 --> 02:10:03.580]
that he was given u.s. intelligence secrets to aran

[02:10:03.580 --> 02:10:07.560]
uh... he was hanging out in a rack and now he's going to be the uh... the book of the pimp

[02:10:07.560 --> 02:10:10.140]
again it's tough out there for an Iraqi pimp man

[02:10:10.660 --> 02:10:11.540]
uh... yeah

[02:10:12.180 --> 02:10:12.960]
pimp this

[02:10:13.940 --> 02:10:14.380]
and

[02:10:15.080 --> 02:10:19.400]

[02:10:56.100 --> 02:10:59.960]

[02:11:11.220 --> 02:11:13.820]
i wouldn't surprise me at least but no matter where their ass is at

[02:11:14.340 --> 02:11:17.520]

for

[02:14:00.020 --> 02:14:04.800]
I'm going to be on a joke today, so I'm not gonna let Prince of Pipe win me my tail!

[02:14:07.260 --> 02:14:09.100]
I know he's sick-loat!

[02:14:11.740 --> 02:14:17.200]
Well, I was there, I was there, I was there, I was there, I was there, I was there, I was there!

[02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:18.200]
You got stuck in the elevator!

[02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:20.680]
And I got lost with the torpedoes!

[02:14:20.720 --> 02:14:22.520]
The glass of condensin!

[02:14:22.660 --> 02:14:25.700]
I was a skilled, good thing I'm big and poor!

[02:14:25.860 --> 02:14:26.680]
I just had an idea!

[02:14:26.680 --> 02:14:29.200]
Wow, the coin on it was the coin on it!

[02:14:29.360 --> 02:14:31.340]
You can see it on me, I look like a watcher!

[02:14:34.260 --> 02:14:35.620]
I was there, I was there!

[02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:37.520]
Okay!

[02:14:40.160 --> 02:14:42.160]
Wow! You are big and strong!

[02:14:42.480 --> 02:14:44.740]
Yeah, but I'm big and strong and you!

[02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:47.400]
I was there, my daddy was the baby!

[02:14:47.920 --> 02:14:50.780]
I was there, my daddy was there, I was there!

[02:14:51.900 --> 02:14:53.200]
What did you ask?

[02:14:53.200 --> 02:14:54.340]
What did you ask?

[02:14:54.340 --> 02:14:55.640]
Do I get nothing on me?

[02:14:55.980 --> 02:14:59.640]
I don't know, I thought it was always fair!

[02:14:59.740 --> 02:15:04.640]
He was 102, but nevertheless, hey listen, we can't do any worse than Mo did there to the fore, can we?

[02:15:05.820 --> 02:15:06.540]
Probably did!

[02:15:07.700 --> 02:15:12.700]
I can't wait till we see those hour by hour ones, man, when I went to that kind of be probably on Friday, maybe Monday?

[02:15:14.100 --> 02:15:17.640]
Probably won't see him at all, I'll probably try to hide those too, I'll put him in the dumpster.

[02:15:18.220 --> 02:15:22.800]
If I was them, I wouldn't let any more numbers out because they're just, you know, they're showing their two colors.

[02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:28.740]
From 168 votes on the poll, we're kicking ass on that, that's the important thing, we don't have one single call on the phone now,

[02:15:28.800 --> 02:15:32.120]
and that's because we've been rambling up for like an hour and 50 minutes, good!

[02:15:32.600 --> 02:15:34.700]
On this rating thing and we're dying over here, yeah!

[02:15:34.940 --> 02:15:42.380]
Like I said, they still are, we're still getting paid, could be worse, right, could be out on the street, could be on a beach, could be out picketing, you know, like the illegal aliens.

[02:15:42.800 --> 02:15:43.220]
Picketing lettuce?

[02:15:43.800 --> 02:15:49.320]
Mike Schur, who had the CIA's been law in the unit for six years, told Australian Broadcasting's company Four Corners,

[02:15:49.500 --> 02:15:51.940]
uh, this is according to the raw story again, a great website.

[02:15:52.240 --> 02:15:57.260]
The US President George Boyce turned out a chance to kill Abu Moussa Balsar Khawaii, believed to be the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq.

[02:15:57.860 --> 02:16:02.500]
He says a plan to destroy Zarkawi's training camp in Kurdistan was abandoned for diplomatic reasons.

[02:16:03.220 --> 02:16:12.340]
The reasons the intelligence service got for not shooting Zarkawi was simply that the President and the National Security Council decided it was more important not to give the Europeans the impression we were gunslingers, he said.

[02:16:13.320 --> 02:16:23.380]
Right, Mr. Bush had Mr. Zarkawi decides for almost every day for a year before the invasion of Iraq and didn't shoot because they were winding and dying in the French and in order to get them to assist us in the invasion of Iraq.

[02:16:23.520 --> 02:16:24.760]
That worked out really well, didn't it?

[02:16:25.360 --> 02:16:26.700]
So, uh, remember those freedom fries?

[02:16:26.860 --> 02:16:27.300]
Oh, yeah.

[02:16:28.180 --> 02:16:28.840]
WQAM, hello.

[02:16:29.420 --> 02:16:30.460]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[02:16:30.780 --> 02:16:31.280]
Okay, sir.

[02:16:31.640 --> 02:16:37.260]
Do you think there are maybe some of those ratings that changed so much, that you drew all the sternalists here, so they won't pay? Have to listen to something else?

[02:16:38.200 --> 02:16:39.320]
Maybe a few of them stick around?

[02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:41.220]
I don't understand what that means.

[02:16:41.580 --> 02:16:49.140]
Oh, when a stern went on to satellite radio in January, all the people that won't pay, have to listen to something else, but your flight was to the wrong upon.

[02:16:50.340 --> 02:16:51.800]
Okay, so you following that?

[02:16:52.060 --> 02:16:53.540]
No, I was hoping you would explain it to me.

[02:16:53.860 --> 02:16:57.280]
Actually, the sternalist is that don't want to pay for serious.

[02:16:57.880 --> 02:16:58.000]
Yeah.

[02:16:58.440 --> 02:16:59.800]
In other words, most of them must be Spanish.

[02:17:00.360 --> 02:17:01.100]
Yeah, that's it.

[02:17:01.680 --> 02:17:02.280]
Now what it is?

[02:17:04.880 --> 02:17:09.840]
I don't see any, in fact, the Ron and Paul, obviously, he didn't have a point in that.

[02:17:10.200 --> 02:17:10.920]
Yeah, in the morning.

[02:17:11.200 --> 02:17:12.040]
They wouldn't buy default.

[02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:13.180]
I mean, who else is doing the work?

[02:17:13.180 --> 02:17:14.240]
They didn't know that's what he's saying.

[02:17:15.120 --> 02:17:15.780]
That's what he's saying.

[02:17:15.920 --> 02:17:20.200]
They had to go somewhere and so they went to Ron and Paul, which is really a pretty sad commentary about morning radio in this market.

[02:17:20.500 --> 02:17:23.300]
In fact, the comments about all radio in this market are all pretty sad.

[02:17:24.100 --> 02:17:25.960]
But, I mean, I haven't been saying for a very long.

[02:17:26.020 --> 02:17:29.020]
I don't want to sound like, you know, whaah, because I'm getting paid a lot of money, you know?

[02:17:29.240 --> 02:17:32.160]
And compared to the rest of this joint, we didn't do that bad.

[02:17:32.380 --> 02:17:33.840]
We did over five when they extrapolated.

[02:17:34.500 --> 02:17:35.540]
It's not a number of facts.

[02:17:35.540 --> 02:17:37.440]
In fact, it's a number of the rest of the day what it would kill for.

[02:17:38.020 --> 02:17:43.080]
We did more than morning and afternoon drive combined, which doesn't please me.

[02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:45.720]
It's not an ego thing because that cost us money, right?

[02:17:46.320 --> 02:17:50.100]
But, you know, if you're going to have a morning guy on air, have him on every day, or at least most of the time.

[02:17:50.260 --> 02:17:50.640]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:17:50.880 --> 02:17:55.540]
I mean, like with me, I got to summer schedule, I had for years, but we know you're on Monday Wednesday and Friday in the summer.

[02:17:55.660 --> 02:17:56.360]
I'm on Tuesday and Thursday.

[02:17:56.700 --> 02:17:57.960]
The audience knows what to expect.

[02:17:58.320 --> 02:18:00.400]
If they hate you like poison, maybe they won't listen to it.

[02:18:00.460 --> 02:18:02.340]
If they hate me like poison, they get us both of them.

[02:18:02.400 --> 02:18:02.900]
They're still listening.

[02:18:02.900 --> 02:18:03.700]
But whatever.

[02:18:04.060 --> 02:18:08.260]
But we just all over the place, we've got basically a Hodge Podge.

[02:18:08.260 --> 02:18:09.460]
Welcome to Hodge Podge radio.

[02:18:09.460 --> 02:18:11.300]
It's a new format, HP, Hodge Podge.

[02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:15.500]
We got a little bit of this over here, and then we got to evolving door to the floor.

[02:18:15.720 --> 02:18:19.740]
We got like, you know, this is not the way to program a radio station.

[02:18:20.160 --> 02:18:23.080]
I started to say before me, before you interrupted me about Ralph Redneck.

[02:18:23.480 --> 02:18:23.740]
Oh, yeah.

[02:18:24.160 --> 02:18:25.140]
I interrupted myself.

[02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:26.160]
You know about consistency.

[02:18:26.560 --> 02:18:27.760]
People want some consistency.

[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:29.220]
They want like Reneerie, man.

[02:18:29.220 --> 02:18:33.100]
He was on there for a long time in the morning and boy, they sure rude the day that they took

[02:18:33.100 --> 02:18:34.560]
his ass off there and I would eat it, didn't they?

[02:18:34.900 --> 02:18:35.280]
Yeah, they did.

[02:18:35.740 --> 02:18:38.280]
After they did that, they didn't know what they were able to do to get the audience back.

[02:18:38.420 --> 02:18:39.580]
And quite frankly, they never did.

[02:18:40.340 --> 02:18:42.140]
Same with a lot of other people that had been on the...

[02:18:42.140 --> 02:18:46.000]
And just like when Greg Reed tried to stick this show on from 9 to 1, that sure worked real well, didn't it?

[02:18:46.080 --> 02:18:51.140]
Or when Disney tried to stick this show on at 9.30 in the morning to try to get a little blood, a little more blood out of the rock.

[02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:56.880]
The people who manage in this business man, I wouldn't give you a dime and Dick Casper rest in peace.

[02:18:56.880 --> 02:18:57.660]
He was a genius.

[02:18:58.520 --> 02:19:05.520]
But for the most part, these people wouldn't know a radio if you shoved my old zenith, a white, big, white radio deep inside their colon.

[02:19:05.960 --> 02:19:06.760]
They just don't get it.

[02:19:07.640 --> 02:19:13.060]
And this guy we got now, he may be the nicest guy that ever came down to Pike Corlear on your reports, never laid eyes on him.

[02:19:13.280 --> 02:19:14.400]
He may be as nice as could be.

[02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:15.620]
I'm not interested in nice.

[02:19:15.740 --> 02:19:16.880]
You know what Leo DeRosha once said?

[02:19:17.260 --> 02:19:17.340]
What?

[02:19:17.780 --> 02:19:18.620]
Nice guys finish.

[02:19:19.180 --> 02:19:19.420]
Last?

[02:19:19.880 --> 02:19:20.640]
That's what he said.

[02:19:21.060 --> 02:19:21.600]
Leo the lip.

[02:19:22.360 --> 02:19:24.920]
Not a question of who's the nicest or who's the best like to this.

[02:19:24.920 --> 02:19:28.260]
And it's a question of somebody with some go on just going to come here and do something.

[02:19:28.540 --> 02:19:29.760]
Get off the dime baby.

[02:19:30.080 --> 02:19:31.240]
Get off the dime.

[02:19:31.720 --> 02:19:35.480]
One's in twos and man are going to do it on a station that was once upon a time dominant.

[02:19:35.900 --> 02:19:37.620]
And I'm going to tell you, I told you this before.

[02:19:38.240 --> 02:19:41.800]
Two springs ago, whatever you're doing with two, spring of 2004, would have been right?

[02:19:42.120 --> 02:19:42.420]
Okay.

[02:19:42.760 --> 02:19:44.100]
When we had Moa and he really morning.

[02:19:44.220 --> 02:19:44.780]
Do do do do.

[02:19:44.820 --> 02:19:45.780]
Even Moa, that's right.

[02:19:45.880 --> 02:19:47.000]
He never had numbers like these.

[02:19:47.280 --> 02:19:49.060]
His numbers were stellar compared to this.

[02:19:49.220 --> 02:19:52.740]
And we had Joe Rosanair and then me and then the mad dog of two, two or whatever.

[02:19:53.280 --> 02:19:54.900]
What was Moa, he doing it that's that.

[02:19:54.920 --> 02:19:56.380]
And then Hank was after a mad dog.

[02:19:56.900 --> 02:19:59.780]
Mad dog was doing two to four and Hank was doing four to seven at that.

[02:19:59.900 --> 02:20:01.880]
And we had a great book and we were kicking ass man.

[02:20:02.380 --> 02:20:04.000]
But don't leave it alone.

[02:20:04.440 --> 02:20:05.920]
Don't be happy that we're kicking ass.

[02:20:06.260 --> 02:20:06.940]
Mess with success.

[02:20:07.540 --> 02:20:09.280]
That's management's favorite line man.

[02:20:09.460 --> 02:20:11.500]
Mess with success if it ain't broke fix it.

[02:20:11.900 --> 02:20:12.320]
Mess with it.

[02:20:12.340 --> 02:20:13.320]
We have to deal with it.

[02:20:13.320 --> 02:20:13.680]
We have to deal with it.

[02:20:13.840 --> 02:20:14.260]
Squeeze it.

[02:20:14.620 --> 02:20:15.860]
Like a big zit man.

[02:20:16.100 --> 02:20:18.440]
Squeeze it until everything just burst out.

[02:20:18.940 --> 02:20:19.860]
And that's that's what they did.

[02:20:21.860 --> 02:20:24.000]
Premier Silvio, Berlusconi, I mentioned this before.

[02:20:24.120 --> 02:20:28.300]
The longest serving Premier and Post-Ware Italy and our major fascist attended his resignation today,

[02:20:28.480 --> 02:20:31.140]
paving the way for a center life government led by Romano Proto,

[02:20:31.380 --> 02:20:32.920]
who's you know, he's been prime minister before.

[02:20:33.100 --> 02:20:36.600]
He goes away and then he comes back and then Berlusconi will go away and then he'll come back.

[02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:40.980]
President Carlos Ezelio Champi, as Berlusconi, your main honest caretaker,

[02:20:41.340 --> 02:20:46.320]
the president's offer said he had silly refuse to concede because he lost his last lesson.

[02:20:46.360 --> 02:20:48.940]
But finally, they said, I guess they finally had to make an offer he couldn't refuse.

[02:20:48.940 --> 02:20:51.060]
But I think we'll take you to Corleone.

[02:20:51.380 --> 02:20:57.000]
And let me say it again, we were such a town as Corleone and it's pretty much what you saw as what you get.

[02:20:57.300 --> 02:20:58.700]
Remember I told you I saw that document, Rihanna?

[02:20:58.840 --> 02:21:00.720]
I'm one of those channels, they any year or something like that?

[02:21:01.200 --> 02:21:01.520]
Biography.

[02:21:01.760 --> 02:21:02.620]
Pretty interesting crap.

[02:21:03.860 --> 02:21:05.480]
1279th holds on the pulver gun over 1300.

[02:21:05.700 --> 02:21:08.640]
We ought to be real excited about that and I'm a girl never gave you a number on that.

[02:21:08.640 --> 02:21:09.460]
That's the best of things.

[02:21:09.480 --> 02:21:10.320]
No, I keep forgetting to ask.

[02:21:10.460 --> 02:21:13.540]
But you recall when I told you just how bad that was slapping, I said,

[02:21:13.780 --> 02:21:15.620]
well we got some real problems here man.

[02:21:15.740 --> 02:21:16.560]
Right, you could feel it.

[02:21:16.560 --> 02:21:18.840]
Oh, I could smell it, I could feel it.

[02:21:19.100 --> 02:21:23.640]
I could felt like taking a very him anima where somebody had chewed off part of the...

[02:21:23.640 --> 02:21:24.060]
Chew!

[02:21:24.200 --> 02:21:25.060]
Oh, it was rough.

[02:21:25.500 --> 02:21:27.700]
It was rough going in and even worse coming out.

[02:21:28.360 --> 02:21:29.660]
And you just knew it.

[02:21:30.120 --> 02:21:35.300]
And you talk to these guys, well you know whatever you say, you're absolutely right, but a beep, but a beep, but a beep, but a beep, and that's it.

[02:21:35.740 --> 02:21:41.540]
I can have a summit conference and a cemetery and get a better response and talk to this crowd.

[02:21:41.600 --> 02:21:42.540]
It's run this year and right now.

[02:21:43.040 --> 02:21:44.560]
The Beasley Vangilboard group ink.

[02:21:45.380 --> 02:21:46.760]
That's George's line by the way.

[02:21:46.900 --> 02:21:47.500]
Give me a full credit.

[02:21:47.740 --> 02:21:48.340]
Thank you.

[02:21:48.400 --> 02:21:49.320]
One of the all-time best.

[02:21:49.420 --> 02:21:49.800]
I'm sure they'll...

[02:21:49.800 --> 02:21:51.500]
Banjo boy group incorporated.

[02:21:51.980 --> 02:21:52.760]
Oh, how perfect.

[02:21:52.960 --> 02:21:54.160]
I should have dig it over there.

[02:21:54.760 --> 02:21:56.300]
Oh, they might get sued by the banjo boy though.

[02:21:56.860 --> 02:21:59.140]
Not too happy about being comparatively clamped.

[02:22:00.360 --> 02:22:03.040]
Ten minutes after one of QA and we got the bow today.

[02:22:03.260 --> 02:22:04.880]
Oh, man give your earlobes a rest.

[02:22:05.280 --> 02:22:12.560]
Give those ear drums a nice rest because bowler, at least bow, I mean you know kind of dull, but at least he talks in a lower register as opposed to...

[02:22:12.600 --> 02:22:15.200]
Oh, that piercing sound.

[02:22:15.820 --> 02:22:17.540]
That's a lot of the old timesports hands remember.

[02:22:17.760 --> 02:22:19.600]
Billy Pierce, the great left-handed pitch for the white socks.

[02:22:19.960 --> 02:22:21.620]
Billy Pierce, let's put his voice on here.

[02:22:22.020 --> 02:22:23.880]
Those piercing sounds that you love to hate.

[02:22:24.120 --> 02:22:25.300]
I'm gonna play that when we come back.

[02:22:25.460 --> 02:22:25.840]
Those sounds?

[02:22:26.380 --> 02:22:27.560]
In fact, now it's nine sounds.

[02:22:27.960 --> 02:22:28.680]
Oh, there's the other one.

[02:23:38.520 --> 02:23:38.840]
No!

[02:23:42.140 --> 02:23:45.200]
Neil God, O-W-Q-A-L.

[02:23:46.040 --> 02:23:48.020]
Where the bag is.

[02:23:50.560 --> 02:23:51.440]
You failed.

[02:23:52.140 --> 02:23:53.100]
Oh, what the heck?

[02:23:53.160 --> 02:23:54.180]
You got to call him.

[02:23:54.360 --> 02:23:56.780]
No number one is rated to the Mojale de David and his own.

[02:23:57.080 --> 02:23:58.880]
And at least according to my aspirations.

[02:23:58.880 --> 02:23:59.800]
You're right.

[02:23:59.860 --> 02:24:00.660]
Stay away from me.

[02:24:00.760 --> 02:24:02.200]
I don't even know how you have children.

[02:24:02.480 --> 02:24:03.380]
They're all alone.

[02:24:03.480 --> 02:24:05.880]
Yes, I want your take on J.P.

[02:24:06.080 --> 02:24:07.700]
They're really J.P.

[02:24:07.860 --> 02:24:08.500]
They're really great.

[02:24:08.500 --> 02:24:09.500]
Is that great, Gordon?

[02:24:09.640 --> 02:24:10.560]
I think a good joke.

[02:24:10.780 --> 02:24:12.000]
I like J.P.

[02:24:12.200 --> 02:24:17.680]
They're really not to mention he's got extraordinary, never-least smooth bettocks.

[02:24:17.980 --> 02:24:18.720]
Oh, yeah!

[02:24:18.920 --> 02:24:20.420]
They're going to be different what you see here.

[02:24:20.500 --> 02:24:22.040]
Oh, dear, thank you more.

[02:24:22.160 --> 02:24:23.120]
Oh, no, no, wait a minute.

[02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:23.500]
They'll go.

[02:24:23.700 --> 02:24:25.720]
But I have nothing else to say.

[02:24:26.240 --> 02:24:27.200]
How about this?

[02:24:27.420 --> 02:24:29.180]
How's the way that down there in the mirror, Maude?

[02:24:29.200 --> 02:24:30.840]
I'm right down the street from you.

[02:24:30.920 --> 02:24:32.460]
I have to go.

[02:24:32.500 --> 02:24:32.820]
Oh, I know.

[02:24:32.840 --> 02:24:33.020]
Oh, wait.

[02:24:33.120 --> 02:24:33.680]
By the way, something.

[02:24:33.680 --> 02:24:35.980]
No, no, I have to go.

[02:24:36.120 --> 02:24:36.880]
Look, I told you what.

[02:24:37.160 --> 02:24:38.240]
I'll hold you open up right.

[02:24:38.380 --> 02:24:38.740]
How's that?

[02:24:39.180 --> 02:24:41.340]
I'll give you one of my old tank t-shirts.

[02:24:41.540 --> 02:24:41.880]
How's that?

[02:24:42.680 --> 02:24:43.460]
It's my way.

[02:24:44.200 --> 02:24:45.800]
That's what the only color we have.

[02:24:45.980 --> 02:24:48.320]
The things I know is growing again.

[02:24:48.720 --> 02:24:51.280]
Oh, no, no, no, no.

[02:24:51.540 --> 02:24:52.060]
Oh, no.

[02:24:52.680 --> 02:24:53.480]
Oh, no.

[02:24:54.200 --> 02:24:54.200]

[02:24:54.560 --> 02:24:54.960]
Oh, no.

[02:24:54.960 --> 02:24:55.860]
I know the color is growing.

[02:24:56.420 --> 02:24:57.100]
Oh, no.

[02:24:57.620 --> 02:24:58.200]
You're going to go.

[02:24:58.200 --> 02:24:58.460]
You're going to go.

[02:24:58.680 --> 02:25:00.440]
Wow, you got it.

[02:25:01.160 --> 02:25:02.260]
Wait, who's there?

[02:25:03.380 --> 02:25:06.300]
I know that I'm your face.

[02:25:07.040 --> 02:25:09.920]
And around those golden temples.

[02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:11.940]
You walk high.

[02:25:12.480 --> 02:25:13.020]
I know, I know.

[02:25:13.540 --> 02:25:14.480]
You feel gold.

[02:25:14.820 --> 02:25:17.500]
Look in the mirror, you see.

[02:25:18.440 --> 02:25:20.300]
A road map of yesterday.

[02:25:21.860 --> 02:25:23.820]
You got your happy signs.

[02:25:23.820 --> 02:25:26.460]
Way to die, die, die.

[02:25:27.600 --> 02:25:29.020]
I know it's glow.

[02:25:29.600 --> 02:25:30.860]
It's something's staying.

[02:25:31.940 --> 02:25:34.760]
Almost every day I paint.

[02:25:35.380 --> 02:25:38.220]
And my veins are so they start to tickle.

[02:25:39.120 --> 02:25:41.280]
I annoy the door to door.

[02:25:41.900 --> 02:25:44.740]
Yeah, I love my gold.

[02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:45.820]
Oh, no, no.

[02:25:46.780 --> 02:25:48.120]
That's what I thought of.

[02:25:48.480 --> 02:25:49.080]
I'm pretty old.

[02:25:57.100 --> 02:25:59.220]
Now I get to see you.

[02:25:59.220 --> 02:25:59.220]

[02:25:59.220 --> 02:26:01.160]
I want you to see you.

[02:26:01.180 --> 02:26:01.820]
I know.

[02:26:03.060 --> 02:26:03.560]
Oh, no.

[02:26:03.560 --> 02:26:03.560]

[02:26:03.560 --> 02:26:03.560]

[02:26:04.700 --> 02:26:07.740]
I know I have a feeling, I know.

[02:26:08.420 --> 02:26:09.780]
I have a feeling, I know.

[02:26:11.500 --> 02:26:19.040]
I have a feeling, I know.

[02:26:19.040 --> 02:26:20.220]
for two to four, TM.

[02:26:20.780 --> 02:26:20.940]
Who?

[02:26:21.460 --> 02:26:21.780]
TM.

[02:26:23.020 --> 02:26:23.660]
Transmitter Maintenance.

[02:26:23.820 --> 02:26:24.400]
Oh, I see.

[02:26:25.080 --> 02:26:25.720]
118, EQM.

[02:26:25.820 --> 02:26:28.060]
Look at all these people in these people in Dave County,

[02:26:28.060 --> 02:26:30.020]
they would just show them before, but all the Mexican flags.

[02:26:30.020 --> 02:26:30.580]
What was that?

[02:26:30.660 --> 02:26:31.620]
And all of them straw hats?

[02:26:31.920 --> 02:26:32.780]
I don't know, I'm going to tell you.

[02:26:33.140 --> 02:26:34.800]
I'm at MSNBC, it's the MS.

[02:26:35.380 --> 02:26:36.100]
I'll just show them more of this.

[02:26:36.200 --> 02:26:36.500]
Look at that.

[02:26:36.540 --> 02:26:41.920]
They're landscaping that have their wages depressed tremendously

[02:26:42.280 --> 02:26:45.860]
by the influx of illegal workers into the labor market.

[02:26:45.860 --> 02:26:46.400]
You go, man.

[02:26:46.400 --> 02:26:49.920]
It's a better wage for that particular person,

[02:26:49.920 --> 02:26:53.760]
but the impact as a whole is to drive wages down.

[02:26:54.320 --> 02:26:55.140]
There you go.

[02:26:55.520 --> 02:26:57.560]
Just like everybody in Lodemont said, you're hero.

[02:26:58.440 --> 02:27:00.660]
Speaking of radio, a crap, serious just announced

[02:27:00.660 --> 02:27:02.720]
this first quarter fiscal numbers for 2006,

[02:27:02.720 --> 02:27:05.560]
revealing that the satcasters lost is more than doubled,

[02:27:05.900 --> 02:27:08.300]
primarily because of a stock payout to Howard's firm.

[02:27:08.740 --> 02:27:11.140]
The company paid out $225 million in stock

[02:27:11.140 --> 02:27:13.080]
related compensation to Stern as part of his deal.

[02:27:13.080 --> 02:27:16.500]
All together, 284.6 million stock related compensation

[02:27:16.500 --> 02:27:17.700]
was paid out in the first quarter.

[02:27:18.180 --> 02:27:21.580]
The net loss for Sirius' quarter one was $458.5 million,

[02:27:21.760 --> 02:27:23.280]
as opposed to the first quarter last year,

[02:27:23.520 --> 02:27:25.060]
when they lost $193.5 million.

[02:27:25.320 --> 02:27:26.880]
However, revenue is also some increase.

[02:27:27.380 --> 02:27:29.940]
Also to the Stern to the tune of $126.5 million,

[02:27:30.260 --> 02:27:33.100]
up to 193% from last year's $43.2 million.

[02:27:33.520 --> 02:27:35.160]
So subscribers who are up revenues up

[02:27:35.160 --> 02:27:35.960]
and they're losing their ass.

[02:27:36.680 --> 02:27:38.760]
Subscriptions continue to climb as Sirius crossed

[02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:41.960]
a 4 million mark with 4 million 77,000 subscribers

[02:27:41.960 --> 02:27:43.120]
now on board for Sirius.

[02:27:43.500 --> 02:27:45.220]
We have the XM numbers the other day.

[02:27:45.500 --> 02:27:46.280]
They got more subscribers.

[02:27:46.440 --> 02:27:47.340]
They're also losing their ass.

[02:27:48.080 --> 02:27:50.640]
In other Sirius news, a complaint has been formally filed

[02:27:50.640 --> 02:27:52.660]
with the FCC over the company's receivers,

[02:27:53.100 --> 02:27:54.640]
which can transmit at low level frequencies

[02:27:54.640 --> 02:27:57.420]
to frequencies at the very beginning of the end of the FM dial.

[02:27:58.020 --> 02:28:00.420]
Radio World reports that communication general Corp

[02:28:00.420 --> 02:28:03.060]
has complained to the FCC specifically about Sirius

[02:28:03.060 --> 02:28:06.860]
incorporating 87.7 and 87.9 megahertz

[02:28:06.860 --> 02:28:09.200]
in the internet intentional radiator mini transmitters,

[02:28:09.480 --> 02:28:11.200]
built in a many a Sirius' satellite receivers.

[02:28:11.720 --> 02:28:13.220]
They've been recent reports of these Sirius signals

[02:28:13.220 --> 02:28:14.700]
overlapping with local stations

[02:28:14.700 --> 02:28:17.360]
and listeners hearing Sirius programming such as Howard Stern

[02:28:17.360 --> 02:28:19.840]
instead of NPR or Christian station.

[02:28:20.280 --> 02:28:21.440]
That's a real hoot.

[02:28:21.540 --> 02:28:23.760]
They're turning in to hear their Christian radio,

[02:28:23.760 --> 02:28:25.740]
their inspirational prayer for the day instead of hearing

[02:28:25.740 --> 02:28:27.100]
how we're talking about the big boobs.

[02:28:27.260 --> 02:28:27.660]
I heard that.

[02:28:27.920 --> 02:28:29.900]
And maybe throw an indication of FRSH bomb.

[02:28:30.160 --> 02:28:30.960]
That would be all good.

[02:28:31.140 --> 02:28:32.080]
I love it.

[02:28:33.760 --> 02:28:36.000]
Corp 196, folks, we probably should take some calls here

[02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.360]
because I've been rambling and just carrying on

[02:28:38.360 --> 02:28:40.280]
like a maniac here for like an hour and a half

[02:28:40.280 --> 02:28:41.220]
and I feel like 10 hours.

[02:28:41.580 --> 02:28:43.120]
My neck is killing me.

[02:28:43.180 --> 02:28:46.640]
Man, 5670560, pound 562,

[02:28:46.700 --> 02:28:48.040]
and he's rising in a singular wireless line.

[02:28:48.620 --> 02:28:49.360]
How many QAAM?

[02:28:49.460 --> 02:28:49.580]
Hello?

[02:28:50.980 --> 02:28:51.620]
Yes, sir.

[02:28:52.100 --> 02:28:53.840]
Oh, Neil, Neil Young.

[02:28:54.980 --> 02:28:56.040]
So you're up to me.

[02:28:56.520 --> 02:28:56.960]
What are you on?

[02:28:57.400 --> 02:28:58.340]
No, it sounds like an idiot.

[02:28:58.500 --> 02:29:01.620]
What he was, five C-C called once and we let him go on

[02:29:01.620 --> 02:29:02.960]
and he actually had something to say for this.

[02:29:03.040 --> 02:29:03.740]
He went, now all of us, anything,

[02:29:03.740 --> 02:29:04.700]
since it's gonna become a rare.

[02:29:04.980 --> 02:29:06.060]
What are you trying to say?

[02:29:06.200 --> 02:29:06.780]
I have no idea.

[02:29:06.800 --> 02:29:07.420]
We know that.

[02:29:07.640 --> 02:29:09.080]
We already know the whole audience knows that.

[02:29:09.080 --> 02:29:12.260]
We may be on Death Store, but we're not that desperate yet.

[02:29:12.380 --> 02:29:14.380]
Well, let's say to your telegram.

[02:29:15.460 --> 02:29:16.260]
WQAAM, hello?

[02:29:16.720 --> 02:29:17.520]
Neil, you all.

[02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:19.700]
I was trying to push the rabies, man.

[02:29:20.140 --> 02:29:21.800]
Hey, Neil, two things real quick.

[02:29:22.020 --> 02:29:23.720]
One of the things is, why can't they play

[02:29:23.720 --> 02:29:24.960]
Death of Neil for the point?

[02:29:25.300 --> 02:29:26.940]
No, no, forget about that.

[02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:28.340]
Come on, Neil, what is it?

[02:29:28.360 --> 02:29:29.020]
And that's the Neil.

[02:29:29.640 --> 02:29:31.580]
When I'm driving the street, I drive all day.

[02:29:31.980 --> 02:29:35.440]
All I see is I get a special mail and also my wife

[02:29:35.440 --> 02:29:37.080]
singing like 80s tunes.

[02:29:37.080 --> 02:29:38.520]
I get the rhythm to the cold.

[02:29:38.900 --> 02:29:39.960]
I'm a beautiful woman too.

[02:29:40.040 --> 02:29:41.080]
That must be it, yeah, okay.

[02:29:41.240 --> 02:29:42.260]
Nice, nice voice, Disney.

[02:29:43.200 --> 02:29:44.380]
Five, what, that was him.

[02:29:44.480 --> 02:29:45.220]
Can you recognize it?

[02:29:45.360 --> 02:29:45.780]
I can tell you.

[02:29:45.860 --> 02:29:46.860]
The bulbous red nose.

[02:29:47.500 --> 02:29:50.180]
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60, pound five, 60,

[02:29:50.200 --> 02:29:51.600]
and they've arrived in the singular wireless line.

[02:29:51.720 --> 02:29:54.340]
Yeah, that's 82 along the coast.

[02:29:56.020 --> 02:29:57.740]
Yeah, no question about him, man.

[02:29:57.780 --> 02:29:58.040]
They're dying.

[02:29:58.140 --> 02:29:59.600]
I would say they're doing probably an 82-year.

[02:30:00.720 --> 02:30:01.320]
WQAAM, hello?

[02:30:01.760 --> 02:30:02.880]
Sounds like you're padding.

[02:30:03.460 --> 02:30:04.020]
Yeah, right.

[02:30:04.420 --> 02:30:05.100]
Sounds like Pat this.

[02:30:05.760 --> 02:30:06.340]
WQAAM, hello?

[02:30:06.880 --> 02:30:07.660]
What are you doing?

[02:30:08.260 --> 02:30:08.260]

[02:30:08.520 --> 02:30:10.340]
I'll say one thing about these protesters.

[02:30:10.540 --> 02:30:11.800]
You know, since Bush took office,

[02:30:12.080 --> 02:30:15.060]
they screwed American workers that tried to take away

[02:30:15.060 --> 02:30:17.360]
our overtime, they tried to take away our healthcare,

[02:30:18.020 --> 02:30:19.360]
they want to cut social security,

[02:30:20.060 --> 02:30:23.040]
then run, the companies go and they declare baked up C

[02:30:23.040 --> 02:30:24.520]
and they would nag on their pensions.

[02:30:24.880 --> 02:30:25.920]
What are they doing about it?

[02:30:26.080 --> 02:30:27.860]
We're just sitting around watching American Idol

[02:30:27.860 --> 02:30:29.220]
and football games.

[02:30:29.600 --> 02:30:30.860]
And these people get up to protest.

[02:30:31.320 --> 02:30:32.180]
You got, oh, I see.

[02:30:32.320 --> 02:30:34.340]
So in other words, the elite, yeah, you got a point there.

[02:30:34.440 --> 02:30:34.780]
That's true.

[02:30:34.780 --> 02:30:35.720]
Even the people,

[02:30:36.440 --> 02:30:37.440]
they're going to work in Europe.

[02:30:37.660 --> 02:30:39.720]
I mean, they thought some laws were hurt then.

[02:30:39.980 --> 02:30:41.920]
They got a doctor asked me when I turned the streets

[02:30:41.920 --> 02:30:42.920]
and took water, can't it?

[02:30:42.920 --> 02:30:43.600]
Yeah, that's true.

[02:30:43.700 --> 02:30:44.100]
That's a point.

[02:30:44.260 --> 02:30:45.360]
Although if these people were so smart,

[02:30:45.360 --> 02:30:46.400]
they wouldn't be out there protesting.

[02:30:46.400 --> 02:30:47.800]
They'd go back into hiding again.

[02:30:48.360 --> 02:30:49.800]
Wait until they come out with a butterfly net

[02:30:49.800 --> 02:30:51.540]
then we'll see how brave they are.

[02:30:52.220 --> 02:30:53.760]
5.67.05.60,

[02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:57.620]
pound 5.60, and they've arrived in a singular wireless line.

[02:30:57.960 --> 02:31:00.420]
One word, keep in mind, illegal aliens.

[02:31:00.600 --> 02:31:01.180]
That's one word.

[02:31:01.400 --> 02:31:02.280]
Keep it in mind, okay?

[02:31:02.800 --> 02:31:03.420]
Not immigrants.

[02:31:03.420 --> 02:31:05.580]
Immigrants are people who came in a court of the system

[02:31:05.580 --> 02:31:06.800]
according to the law,

[02:31:06.900 --> 02:31:07.880]
court of the process.

[02:31:08.120 --> 02:31:08.880]
Waited in line.

[02:31:09.260 --> 02:31:11.220]
Just like my grandparents on both sides,

[02:31:11.220 --> 02:31:12.540]
they came in through Ellis Island.

[02:31:12.740 --> 02:31:13.420]
They waited online.

[02:31:13.860 --> 02:31:15.380]
They went over past the test,

[02:31:15.560 --> 02:31:16.280]
they looked at the test,

[02:31:16.500 --> 02:31:16.760]
they said,

[02:31:17.060 --> 02:31:18.660]
and the castle hoist,

[02:31:18.720 --> 02:31:19.120]
that was it.

[02:31:19.280 --> 02:31:20.340]
They look up your butt with a flashlight.

[02:31:20.660 --> 02:31:21.100]
That's right.

[02:31:21.500 --> 02:31:23.040]
Just like side of them there in all in pictures

[02:31:23.040 --> 02:31:23.940]
where they're looking in his mouth

[02:31:23.940 --> 02:31:25.120]
with that flashlight looking for,

[02:31:25.580 --> 02:31:26.760]
and that's where the weapons were.

[02:31:27.560 --> 02:31:29.400]
But no, that's why they kept looking so long.

[02:31:29.560 --> 02:31:30.820]
See if they had the weapons in his throat.

[02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:32.600]
WDQYM, hello.

[02:31:33.420 --> 02:31:33.760]
Emil.

[02:31:34.060 --> 02:31:34.640]
Yes, sir.

[02:31:35.040 --> 02:31:36.020]
At least they're working.

[02:31:36.240 --> 02:31:38.860]
They're not in Liberty City hanging out at the corner

[02:31:38.860 --> 02:31:39.700]
on top of a,

[02:31:40.260 --> 02:31:40.940]
of a building.

[02:31:40.940 --> 02:31:41.380]
Okay, great.

[02:31:41.520 --> 02:31:43.080]
We'll go ahead to the first time, okay, Schmuck?

[02:31:43.820 --> 02:31:44.400]
WDQYM, hello.

[02:31:45.180 --> 02:31:46.800]
You know, you're so full of hate.

[02:31:47.040 --> 02:31:47.140]
Why?

[02:31:47.460 --> 02:31:48.240]
Okay, there we go.

[02:31:48.320 --> 02:31:49.400]
I knew it.

[02:31:49.460 --> 02:31:50.360]
It's just a matter of time.

[02:31:50.760 --> 02:31:52.180]
And you're spouting that atheism

[02:31:52.180 --> 02:31:53.380]
and you don't believe in God.

[02:31:53.780 --> 02:31:55.820]
When you guys get back to business or what is it?

[02:31:55.880 --> 02:31:56.220]
You know, I'm pretty,

[02:31:56.240 --> 02:31:57.000]
they probably wore it out.

[02:31:57.480 --> 02:31:59.100]
God, maybe this is an admission.

[02:31:59.440 --> 02:32:00.040]
Is that what it is?

[02:32:00.140 --> 02:32:00.220]
Yeah.

[02:32:00.460 --> 02:32:01.580]
I think you have the mission part.

[02:32:02.820 --> 02:32:03.380]
WDQYM, hello.

[02:32:04.620 --> 02:32:04.940]
QYM.

[02:32:05.660 --> 02:32:06.240]
I got a,

[02:32:06.720 --> 02:32:09.120]
I got a suggestion on how you can improve those numbers, Neil.

[02:32:09.520 --> 02:32:11.240]
Yeah, give away Marlin tickets.

[02:32:11.740 --> 02:32:13.180]
Yeah, okay, no, do it.

[02:32:13.200 --> 02:32:14.080]
Aha, aha.

[02:32:14.660 --> 02:32:15.220]
There's a guy there.

[02:32:15.440 --> 02:32:16.800]
Look, he got left out of the circle.

[02:32:18.480 --> 02:32:18.800]
5670560,

[02:32:19.380 --> 02:32:21.540]
Tom 560 and the Verizon singular wireless line.

[02:32:21.760 --> 02:32:23.380]
We couldn't, if we paid you to take him,

[02:32:23.420 --> 02:32:24.440]
we couldn't give away Marlin tickets.

[02:32:24.580 --> 02:32:25.080]
How do you like that?

[02:32:25.560 --> 02:32:27.760]
We could sure get some female collars, though, that way, couldn't we?

[02:32:28.080 --> 02:32:29.040]
Oh, you're giving something away?

[02:32:29.220 --> 02:32:29.540]
What do you think?

[02:32:29.660 --> 02:32:29.840]
Oh, yeah.

[02:32:29.840 --> 02:32:31.560]
Don't tell you, uh-huh, get lost.

[02:32:32.440 --> 02:32:33.160]
WDQYM, hello.

[02:32:33.560 --> 02:32:34.480]
No, go anglais.

[02:32:35.460 --> 02:32:36.140]
WDQYM, hello.

[02:32:36.800 --> 02:32:37.720]
Yeah, okay, no, no.

[02:32:38.280 --> 02:32:38.720]
QYM.

[02:32:39.160 --> 02:32:40.380]
Neil, yes.

[02:32:40.560 --> 02:32:41.220]
Well, that was quick.

[02:32:41.420 --> 02:32:42.320]
It just rang once.

[02:32:42.680 --> 02:32:43.700]
Well, that's okay, that's good.

[02:32:43.960 --> 02:32:44.780]
Beautiful, listen.

[02:32:45.660 --> 02:32:49.660]
Just an idea, thought about yesterday's marches

[02:32:51.120 --> 02:32:53.540]
and definition of, and I say definition

[02:32:53.540 --> 02:32:56.240]
for reason of illegal aliens,

[02:32:56.740 --> 02:32:58.000]
because they should be the same.

[02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:02.740]
But the point is, if all of these people got citizenship,

[02:33:03.500 --> 02:33:06.120]
that would mean that they would then have to be paid minimum wage,

[02:33:06.340 --> 02:33:07.960]
which means they would then lose all the drugs

[02:33:07.960 --> 02:33:09.260]
that they're coming here for anyway.

[02:33:09.600 --> 02:33:10.880]
You have to get a new bathroom, right?

[02:33:11.200 --> 02:33:12.060]
Does that sound logical?

[02:33:12.640 --> 02:33:13.700]
Yeah, then we have to get some illegal.

[02:33:13.960 --> 02:33:14.360]
We have to get illegal.

[02:33:14.360 --> 02:33:14.720]
Yeah, I do.

[02:33:15.200 --> 02:33:15.860]
We have to get illegal.

[02:33:16.760 --> 02:33:16.880]
Right.

[02:33:17.360 --> 02:33:21.100]
Now, two things they've done, your dislike or like

[02:33:21.100 --> 02:33:25.080]
of certain newscasters, who would you choose

[02:33:25.080 --> 02:33:27.100]
to watch if you had to make a choice?

[02:33:28.720 --> 02:33:30.380]
Kidi Crowley or Rita Clauseley?

[02:33:31.380 --> 02:33:32.120]
I would rather be.

[02:33:32.400 --> 02:33:33.300]
Well, my brain's up.

[02:33:33.520 --> 02:33:33.700]
Yeah.

[02:33:34.160 --> 02:33:35.700]
I mean, what kind of a choice is that?

[02:33:36.080 --> 02:33:40.060]
First of all, Kidi Crowley is not a newscasters,

[02:33:40.060 --> 02:33:42.660]
she's a reporter, she doesn't have a show.

[02:33:43.100 --> 02:33:43.900]
Am I still on?

[02:33:44.360 --> 02:33:45.300]
Yeah, it sounds like you.

[02:33:45.700 --> 02:33:47.280]
Oh, OK, no, I thought I heard the senator

[02:33:47.280 --> 02:33:48.500]
wouldn't be kidding, I was being thrown out.

[02:33:48.740 --> 02:33:49.940]
No, it's fine.

[02:33:50.060 --> 02:33:51.940]
I mean, why don't you ask me about Kidi Crowley

[02:33:51.940 --> 02:33:52.800]
and Rita Clauseley?

[02:33:52.860 --> 02:33:53.760]
What do they have to do with you?

[02:33:53.760 --> 02:33:56.360]
That's what I meant, reporters, in the sense that you

[02:33:56.360 --> 02:33:56.660]
find the law.

[02:33:56.660 --> 02:33:58.120]
Well, I know I find the law.

[02:33:58.160 --> 02:33:59.020]
He's a talking head.

[02:33:59.140 --> 02:34:02.300]
They both Kidi Crowley is a giant in the industry.

[02:34:02.960 --> 02:34:04.200]
Well, what that was all about?

[02:34:04.400 --> 02:34:06.400]
I mean, talk about desperate to create some material.

[02:34:06.680 --> 02:34:07.100]
Am I still on?

[02:34:07.500 --> 02:34:08.240]
Yeah, am I still on?

[02:34:08.820 --> 02:34:09.300]
This is my effect.

[02:34:09.440 --> 02:34:10.560]
I looked at numbers and I'm asking.

[02:34:10.680 --> 02:34:11.280]
Am I still on?

[02:34:11.740 --> 02:34:11.900]
No.

[02:34:12.460 --> 02:34:12.580]
OK.

[02:34:13.100 --> 02:34:14.900]
You remember the sum of the days I've asked recently?

[02:34:15.080 --> 02:34:16.220]
Are we just a transmit around?

[02:34:16.320 --> 02:34:17.400]
Are we actually on the air or what?

[02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:19.460]
I want you to give a big one.

[02:34:20.420 --> 02:34:22.240]
And I'm going to stop calling them Parabell.

[02:34:22.240 --> 02:34:23.640]
It's Bozo the Clown.

[02:34:24.460 --> 02:34:24.460]

[02:34:24.800 --> 02:34:24.840]
OK.

[02:34:25.300 --> 02:34:26.620]
Because this guy is a real Bozo.

[02:34:27.200 --> 02:34:28.460]
And when you see Bozo in a hole,

[02:34:28.540 --> 02:34:30.560]
I want you to give him a big kiss on the lips for me.

[02:34:30.580 --> 02:34:31.720]
I say, oh, man, he was so pretty.

[02:34:31.740 --> 02:34:32.740]
You know what you've done?

[02:34:32.900 --> 02:34:32.980]
Yeah.

[02:34:33.340 --> 02:34:34.960]
I wasn't happy with the note instead.

[02:34:35.140 --> 02:34:36.160]
No, no, I'm both cheeks.

[02:34:36.300 --> 02:34:37.840]
You know, like the European way they would do it.

[02:34:38.040 --> 02:34:38.660]
Big kiss.

[02:34:39.160 --> 02:34:41.580]
Of course, he came from kiss, so he can probably relate to it.

[02:34:42.340 --> 02:34:44.460]
27 after 1 at 5, 60, WFM.

[02:34:44.520 --> 02:34:46.680]
We got Kimba Boca for a great American coming up

[02:34:46.680 --> 02:34:47.260]
at 2 o'clock.

[02:34:47.860 --> 02:34:49.560]
I'll bet you when we get the hour by hour,

[02:34:49.680 --> 02:34:51.520]
bet you they did once again between 2 and 4.

[02:34:51.520 --> 02:34:54.560]
I have a feeling and a poor mad dog, man.

[02:34:54.920 --> 02:34:58.520]
The great part of the whole thing is they're destroying all

[02:34:58.520 --> 02:35:00.120]
of the elements that were successful before.

[02:35:00.660 --> 02:35:02.540]
And at least we don't all have to take it personally.

[02:35:02.840 --> 02:35:03.440]
Because that just does.

[02:35:03.820 --> 02:35:06.100]
They're destroying each and every element on the station.

[02:35:06.160 --> 02:35:09.340]
It was highly successful before as in highly salicy.

[02:35:09.760 --> 02:35:12.740]
And they, you know, and just selectively butchering,

[02:35:12.920 --> 02:35:13.560]
just butchering.

[02:35:14.040 --> 02:35:16.460]
At the Melving Pod, Fondo isn't just a meal, man.

[02:35:16.560 --> 02:35:18.240]
It's a memorable four-course dining experience

[02:35:18.240 --> 02:35:20.040]
where you can really dip into something different.

[02:35:20.040 --> 02:35:21.820]
And who doesn't like to dip into something exciting?

[02:35:22.240 --> 02:35:23.120]
And you have a variety of unique

[02:35:23.120 --> 02:35:25.160]
on trades and special Melving Pod dipping sauces.

[02:35:25.680 --> 02:35:27.320]
Imagine starting dinner with the Melving Pods

[02:35:27.320 --> 02:35:28.440]
we now in cheese fondue.

[02:35:28.620 --> 02:35:29.660]
It served with three different breads,

[02:35:30.080 --> 02:35:31.460]
granny smith apples and crisp veggies.

[02:35:31.800 --> 02:35:32.720]
And you sit there with a big smile

[02:35:32.720 --> 02:35:34.600]
and you push in and you dip it and you enjoy it.

[02:35:34.720 --> 02:35:35.040]
It's great.

[02:35:35.460 --> 02:35:37.200]
Next to choices salads all with the Melving Pods

[02:35:37.200 --> 02:35:39.300]
homemade dressings, I'm tracing food lobster,

[02:35:39.680 --> 02:35:41.320]
filet mignon, shrimp, cajun, seasoned chicken,

[02:35:41.740 --> 02:35:42.880]
pork, parterbella, mushroom, duck,

[02:35:43.040 --> 02:35:44.460]
and lots more cooked in oil or broth.

[02:35:44.960 --> 02:35:47.360]
And those Melving Pod dipping sauces absolutely out

[02:35:47.360 --> 02:35:47.880]
of this world.

[02:35:47.880 --> 02:35:50.220]
And for dessert, this will really set you free.

[02:35:50.500 --> 02:35:52.620]
The chocolate fondue is so good, it's to die for.

[02:35:53.020 --> 02:35:57.120]
Dip fresh your strawberries, bananas, pineapples,

[02:35:57.260 --> 02:35:58.540]
cheesecake, brownies, top-drop,

[02:35:58.660 --> 02:36:00.800]
with tasty marshmallows, rolled in crushed Oreos

[02:36:00.800 --> 02:36:01.480]
and graham crackers.

[02:36:01.740 --> 02:36:02.260]
Do you ever have those?

[02:36:02.720 --> 02:36:03.800]
Yes, not if I could put those on.

[02:36:03.800 --> 02:36:05.700]
Oh my God, just a thought of it,

[02:36:05.700 --> 02:36:06.720]
it's enough to set me free.

[02:36:07.220 --> 02:36:07.980]
The Melving Pod.

[02:36:08.160 --> 02:36:08.920]
And don't forget, by the way,

[02:36:08.940 --> 02:36:10.740]
Mother's Day is coming up in less than two weeks now,

[02:36:10.880 --> 02:36:11.460]
two weeks from yesterday,

[02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.860]
Mother's Day from Sunday, Mother's Day is Sunday, May 14.

[02:36:15.360 --> 02:36:17.160]
And everybody knows that Mom's love the Melving Pods.

[02:36:17.160 --> 02:36:18.680]
And so I get left out called to make your reservations

[02:36:18.680 --> 02:36:20.420]
for a real treat, something different and delicious

[02:36:20.420 --> 02:36:22.360]
for Mom on Mother's Day May 14.

[02:36:22.860 --> 02:36:24.580]
You'll find the Melving Pods in Fort Lauderdale,

[02:36:24.700 --> 02:36:26.780]
Coral Springs, Vokoratone, North Miami Beach,

[02:36:26.980 --> 02:36:28.660]
Kendall, and prestigious Cooper City.

[02:36:29.140 --> 02:36:31.240]
This is Neural Rogers.

[02:36:32.420 --> 02:36:35.020]
This is 5.16 Q.A.

[02:36:38.980 --> 02:36:40.640]
Neural, yeah.

[02:36:45.540 --> 02:36:48.180]
Her Ses fırs on Gott Nahas relationships as the sun shines.

[02:36:51.140 --> 02:36:54.660]
In a million dawn lights our Home

[02:36:54.660 --> 02:36:57.920]
for little baby child of korker centered

[02:36:57.920 --> 02:37:00.860]
el rise, and甚麼 of wave.

[02:37:02.120 --> 02:37:04.500]
In this wrong keep train,

[02:37:06.040 --> 02:37:09.720]
does here's a thing

[02:37:09.720 --> 02:37:14.000]
They believe a child must be born inside of me

[02:37:18.440 --> 02:37:20.900]
It's our girl's to run on the sand

[02:37:20.900 --> 02:37:24.260]
White Katie broke up with his name

[02:37:24.260 --> 02:37:28.720]
Sure he's hot, but he's crazy at that

[02:37:29.720 --> 02:37:31.980]
Make me sense me, you

[02:37:32.720 --> 02:37:35.560]
To believe in and see you

[02:37:35.560 --> 02:37:38.740]
So we just shake our hands

[02:37:38.740 --> 02:37:40.900]
Something we can laugh at

[02:37:42.300 --> 02:37:44.400]
But that poor child

[02:37:44.400 --> 02:37:45.660]
I think you're mad

[02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:51.160]
Because there's one thing the world don't need

[02:37:51.160 --> 02:37:55.740]
And learn to decide the Scientology and the Doodle

[02:37:58.260 --> 02:37:58.840]
Absolutely

[02:37:58.840 --> 02:38:01.520]
And Scientology is mine

[02:38:01.520 --> 02:38:03.280]
Yes, I think so

[02:38:05.420 --> 02:38:07.900]
133.27.02, both camp were at 2

[02:38:07.900 --> 02:38:09.680]
We got 13 every 15 votes out of Poland

[02:38:09.680 --> 02:38:11.680]
We finally found one who didn't go to school yesterday

[02:38:11.680 --> 02:38:12.700]
Shame on you

[02:38:12.700 --> 02:38:14.100]
Shame on you, man

[02:38:14.100 --> 02:38:15.040]
It took a long time

[02:38:15.540 --> 02:38:17.080]
Probably spoken in some of that good stuff

[02:38:17.080 --> 02:38:18.100]
Of course they could have been sick

[02:38:18.660 --> 02:38:20.500]
5 6 7 0 5 60

[02:38:20.500 --> 02:38:21.500]
0 5 60

[02:38:21.500 --> 02:38:22.680]
Leave a rise in the singular

[02:38:22.680 --> 02:38:23.900]
Wireless line, man

[02:38:23.900 --> 02:38:26.960]
Let's get those phones re-crank up for a big close in 27 minutes today

[02:38:26.960 --> 02:38:27.440]
What do you say?

[02:38:27.680 --> 02:38:30.040]
Or let's just re-play last night's Marlon game, the eighth inning

[02:38:30.500 --> 02:38:31.860]
30 QAM, hello

[02:38:32.340 --> 02:38:32.780]
George

[02:38:32.780 --> 02:38:33.600]
Yeah

[02:38:34.060 --> 02:38:35.700]
Hey, I was just calling you

[02:38:35.700 --> 02:38:37.360]
Because I couldn't get in touch with you

[02:38:37.360 --> 02:38:38.660]
You guys didn't get the phone

[02:38:38.660 --> 02:38:42.180]
Listen, the Argentinians now are just as bad as

[02:38:42.180 --> 02:38:44.460]
You know, the international question has the Mexicans

[02:38:44.460 --> 02:38:45.060]
You know that, right?

[02:38:45.520 --> 02:38:46.180]
What do you mean by that?

[02:38:47.760 --> 02:38:51.720]
Well, two or three years ago the economy fell apart

[02:38:51.720 --> 02:38:52.780]
Yeah, I know that

[02:38:53.440 --> 02:38:56.960]
Well, before then they didn't need a visa to come into the United States

[02:38:56.960 --> 02:38:58.580]
Sort of like the British and the Germans

[02:38:58.580 --> 02:39:01.780]
Those people, they don't need a visa to come into the country

[02:39:01.780 --> 02:39:04.900]
Now they are required by law to get a visa

[02:39:04.900 --> 02:39:08.520]
So even if they get a visa, they usually get a visa

[02:39:08.520 --> 02:39:11.180]
I'm just telling you, it wasn't a matter of political, political, or anything

[02:39:11.180 --> 02:39:13.560]
Because you were watching a lot of our shluppers

[02:39:13.560 --> 02:39:14.640]
Yeah, they're shluppers

[02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:15.760]
Yeah, so now

[02:39:15.760 --> 02:39:19.000]
Like all of Latin America, there are a bunch of shluppers and they all want to come up here, right?

[02:39:19.220 --> 02:39:20.560]
Up there, excuse me

[02:39:20.560 --> 02:39:21.840]
Up here, uh-uh

[02:39:21.840 --> 02:39:22.260]
Down here

[02:39:22.260 --> 02:39:23.420]
Now, down there

[02:39:24.980 --> 02:39:28.400]
567056, it was always he tried to say there's a lot of poverty and shluppers and disaster

[02:39:28.400 --> 02:39:30.060]
We're in a lot of chaos and our history

[02:39:30.060 --> 02:39:33.400]
But we thought that Argentina was doing okay and apparently they're not

[02:39:33.400 --> 02:39:35.440]
No, whoever said that they were doing okay

[02:39:35.440 --> 02:39:37.280]
Well, they got the Nazis over there, so they're not

[02:39:37.280 --> 02:39:39.780]
Well, that's, those are all dead now, man

[02:39:39.780 --> 02:39:41.820]
Yeah, no, we got their children in the radio

[02:39:41.820 --> 02:39:43.400]
They took up some of that Argentinian beef

[02:39:44.680 --> 02:39:45.480]
WDQYM, hello

[02:39:46.500 --> 02:39:47.320]
Yo, Neil

[02:39:47.780 --> 02:39:48.180]
Yeah

[02:39:51.300 --> 02:39:54.340]
I was just wondering, guys, what the numbers?

[02:39:54.820 --> 02:39:57.980]
It's only one way to get those numbers up, you got to get things away

[02:39:57.980 --> 02:39:59.940]
Yeah, hold your breath, man

[02:39:59.940 --> 02:40:02.540]
Here's the dial tone for you, okay? No extra charge

[02:40:03.680 --> 02:40:04.300]
WDQYM, hello

[02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:06.580]
Mexican, the other white meat

[02:40:08.200 --> 02:40:08.800]
WDQYM, hello

[02:40:09.320 --> 02:40:11.460]
I didn't go to school, I didn't go to work

[02:40:11.460 --> 02:40:12.000]
I got my-

[02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:13.640]
Mexicans are brown, by the way, Jack, cool

[02:40:13.640 --> 02:40:15.600]
Yes sir, go ahead, you didn't go to school

[02:40:16.120 --> 02:40:18.540]
I sat on my butt all day

[02:40:18.540 --> 02:40:20.480]
Like an idiot

[02:40:20.480 --> 02:40:26.680]
And then finally I just went out and I put a bumper sticker on my neighbor that has a bush chaining or a forest sticker

[02:40:26.680 --> 02:40:29.500]
That says, I'm also a hypocrite, right next to it

[02:40:29.500 --> 02:40:30.620]
Excellent, good job, pal

[02:40:30.620 --> 02:40:35.560]
I couldn't go protest because I'm not going to stand in the middle of western by myself

[02:40:35.560 --> 02:40:37.740]
I don't blame you, plus are you in the legal alien?

[02:40:38.360 --> 02:40:39.980]
Uh, not anymore, haha

[02:40:42.780 --> 02:40:43.100]
Alright

[02:40:44.080 --> 02:40:48.280]
He was before he made a phone call and I was coached, you're okay, but we like his altitude, so you're okay

[02:40:48.280 --> 02:40:49.260]
You can stay

[02:40:49.260 --> 02:40:50.620]
He got legalized

[02:40:50.620 --> 02:40:53.260]
That's right, we just legalized, in fact, that could be a new format

[02:40:53.260 --> 02:40:56.900]
Call it a show, we will legalize you right here on the garage or show

[02:40:56.900 --> 02:40:59.200]
We'll baptize and legalize you, well, that is correct

[02:40:59.200 --> 02:41:01.440]
And circumcise and Simonize

[02:41:01.440 --> 02:41:05.240]
Because if you're going to come in from Latin America man, you definitely need to be circumcised

[02:41:05.240 --> 02:41:05.880]
Don't touch!

[02:41:07.200 --> 02:41:07.840]
WDQYM, hello

[02:41:07.840 --> 02:41:10.780]
See, like I hesitate when he asks, and when people do, they go

[02:41:10.780 --> 02:41:13.260]
Yeah, he knew what I was trying to call

[02:41:13.260 --> 02:41:16.020]
They got to think about it, hey Neil, just one thing

[02:41:16.600 --> 02:41:20.780]
I'm really happy you and I hanged you back together on the air, you know, I missed that

[02:41:21.280 --> 02:41:22.460]
What would you mean by that?

[02:41:23.060 --> 02:41:24.620]
Well, you guys did a little falling out of here

[02:41:24.620 --> 02:41:25.780]
Don't we even have any falling out?

[02:41:25.860 --> 02:41:27.120]
This is a goofball again?

[02:41:27.760 --> 02:41:29.520]
Yeah, G is in goofball, yeah

[02:41:30.280 --> 02:41:31.160]
WDQYM, hello

[02:41:31.160 --> 02:41:33.820]
Hey, we are, you can't take us tonight today

[02:41:33.820 --> 02:41:37.060]
Yeah, no problem, hang on, WDQYM, hello

[02:41:37.060 --> 02:41:39.960]
Yes, sir, I'm going to do it

[02:41:39.960 --> 02:41:42.160]
Yeah, it's GIL, are you doing?

[02:41:42.520 --> 02:41:43.360]
Studying GIL

[02:41:43.360 --> 02:41:46.360]
Oh GIL, Studying GIL, we got a fraction of Studying GIL this morning

[02:41:46.360 --> 02:41:48.480]
First time we've heard from him in about 100 years

[02:41:48.480 --> 02:41:50.360]
Yes, sir, how are you, sir?

[02:41:50.600 --> 02:41:51.360]
I've been pretty good

[02:41:51.360 --> 02:41:54.960]
Hey, I just wanted to see the, we just had a rating

[02:41:55.780 --> 02:41:58.900]
I was asleep and I'm denying air, sir

[02:41:58.900 --> 02:42:00.360]
No, you don't want to hear him?

[02:42:00.520 --> 02:42:01.340]
Yes, I do, sir

[02:42:01.340 --> 02:42:02.220]
Hey, I'm going to start

[02:42:02.220 --> 02:42:05.300]
I'm going to start getting a bit of a fan

[02:42:05.660 --> 02:42:09.060]
I can help on these stuff, they're real bad if you take a breath, Studying GIL

[02:42:09.060 --> 02:42:09.580]
Okay

[02:42:09.580 --> 02:42:10.160]
Not good

[02:42:10.720 --> 02:42:13.280]
Okay, okay, but go ahead, I'm ready

[02:42:14.540 --> 02:42:15.220]
There you go

[02:42:15.940 --> 02:42:17.740]
No, he's ready for that, he's down for it

[02:42:17.740 --> 02:42:19.320]
Yeah, go ahead, I'm ready

[02:42:19.860 --> 02:42:21.140]
I've heard that before too

[02:42:22.600 --> 02:42:25.760]
5670560, pound 5660, they've arrived in Singular wireless line

[02:42:26.420 --> 02:42:27.140]
WDQYM, hello

[02:42:27.700 --> 02:42:29.500]
Who are you?

[02:42:29.560 --> 02:42:30.000]
Who are you?

[02:42:31.160 --> 02:42:32.540]
Yeah, I'm going to start the meal

[02:42:33.140 --> 02:42:33.200]
Speaking

[02:42:34.040 --> 02:42:38.820]
No, I want to show you guys who do the song series or the parody songs

[02:42:38.820 --> 02:42:39.380]
Yeah

[02:42:39.940 --> 02:42:43.920]
I bought a, you know the song that air, it's with Choe here

[02:42:43.920 --> 02:42:45.640]
I mean, it, Choe has got a gun

[02:42:45.640 --> 02:42:46.520]
Yeah

[02:42:46.520 --> 02:42:48.840]
How about Choe, you've got a gun

[02:42:48.840 --> 02:42:50.440]
Yeah, that's boring

[02:42:50.440 --> 02:42:52.360]
And old and there's like five bits on it

[02:42:52.360 --> 02:42:54.640]
Yeah, we've already got about a hundred bits on it

[02:42:54.640 --> 02:42:57.560]
Let's see, she's got a gun

[02:42:59.320 --> 02:43:00.360]
That's how, oh yeah

[02:43:00.360 --> 02:43:01.280]
This one like

[02:43:01.840 --> 02:43:05.500]
How to keep taking what you got

[02:43:06.200 --> 02:43:10.300]
Check the check it inside, y'all, inside, y'all

[02:43:10.300 --> 02:43:18.800]
God, God, God, God, God, God, God

[02:43:20.360 --> 02:43:22.020]
Choe needs got a gun

[02:43:23.500 --> 02:43:24.260]
There you go

[02:43:24.260 --> 02:43:25.940]
That was quick, how did that idea start?

[02:43:26.040 --> 02:43:26.220]
What did you do?

[02:43:26.980 --> 02:43:29.240]
Here's the fact that says, Rachel was always

[02:43:29.240 --> 02:43:32.280]
Paul Hackett, X-Marine was sitting in for Jerry Springer the other morning

[02:43:32.280 --> 02:43:36.460]
And he called 911 Truth People a bunch of wackos, they should stop smoking a crack pipe

[02:43:36.460 --> 02:43:39.360]
Who the hell cares about Jerry Springer or Paul Hackett?

[02:43:39.360 --> 02:43:42.280]
Thank Robin Williams and his RV, what does it say?

[02:43:42.600 --> 02:43:44.760]
We're able to keep you at 93 from number one spot

[02:43:45.360 --> 02:43:47.300]
Oh, yeah, Robin Williams, that was the number on movies

[02:43:47.300 --> 02:43:48.900]
That's how great it is

[02:43:48.900 --> 02:43:53.200]
The last three minutes of take from the recorder fly 93 has always been missing

[02:43:53.200 --> 02:43:56.480]
For people to increase their own weight, is that when the missile shot it down?

[02:43:56.680 --> 02:43:57.000]
That's right

[02:43:57.000 --> 02:44:00.800]
For people looking to increase their own awareness, there's an 911 Truth conference in Chicago in June

[02:44:00.800 --> 02:44:01.800]
Yeah, okay

[02:44:02.800 --> 02:44:03.800]
Thanks very much, Roy

[02:44:04.460 --> 02:44:06.060]
All you people, I want to know the truth

[02:44:06.060 --> 02:44:09.340]
Just like the thing I watched on the Kennedy assassination the other day

[02:44:09.340 --> 02:44:13.020]
Okay, we all know what isn't the truth, but the fact is we're not going to know the truth

[02:44:13.020 --> 02:44:14.540]
It's about a beep, about a boop

[02:44:14.540 --> 02:44:17.620]
Oh, and you know something, I forgot that Joe Pesci was in JFK

[02:44:17.620 --> 02:44:22.120]
He played David Ferry, you know, with the real bad hair piece in the eyebrae

[02:44:22.120 --> 02:44:25.240]
And if that convinced me more than ever that he and Volka Bryant are the same

[02:44:25.240 --> 02:44:25.880]
They are

[02:44:25.880 --> 02:44:26.700]
Same person

[02:44:26.700 --> 02:44:30.260]
Because he was wearing the same piece, you know, a silly wig that Volka puts on every now and then

[02:44:30.260 --> 02:44:33.160]
That was the one that Joe Pesci was wearing in JFK

[02:44:33.160 --> 02:44:36.780]
And he was talking, yeah, he was still talking that same voice, it might have been a mystery

[02:44:36.780 --> 02:44:40.940]
And a bunch of mysteries and over here and over there, nobody's ever got a no, but it was the same deal

[02:44:40.940 --> 02:44:43.260]
Joe Pesci is chicken egg

[02:44:43.260 --> 02:44:45.640]
This is Neil Roger

[02:44:46.700 --> 02:44:49.160]
This is 5.62.8

[02:44:53.380 --> 02:44:55.860]
Katie Horser, Labour star

[02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.240]
Saiyan, Pala, Chi, Impala

[02:45:01.800 --> 02:45:05.240]
That should not allow to make a sound

[02:45:06.540 --> 02:45:10.320]
Even if your girl parts into ground

[02:45:10.320 --> 02:45:17.240]
And you can't have a never-futurile fall to tame

[02:45:17.240 --> 02:45:19.900]
You must have seen

[02:45:20.980 --> 02:45:23.520]
They have a room

[02:45:23.520 --> 02:45:25.500]
A silence

[02:45:26.580 --> 02:45:29.840]
Or even though the pain's extreme

[02:45:31.680 --> 02:45:34.620]
And you are the Alex Green

[02:45:36.360 --> 02:45:40.520]
They'll run over, test the shots you have

[02:45:40.520 --> 02:45:44.800]
If you ask me that's a load of crap

[02:45:45.520 --> 02:45:51.240]
It's like driving a tractor trailer through a doggy toll

[02:45:51.240 --> 02:45:52.440]
I think you're at

[02:45:52.440 --> 02:45:54.400]
A lot of joy

[02:45:55.460 --> 02:45:57.760]
And still they ask

[02:45:57.760 --> 02:45:59.940]
Is for silence

[02:46:01.460 --> 02:46:04.720]
Because of the shape that you're in

[02:46:05.880 --> 02:46:08.540]
You'll want to swear like George Carlin

[02:46:10.780 --> 02:46:14.520]
You'll wish you could use those seven words

[02:46:15.260 --> 02:46:18.520]
You'll feel like they're caught in new birth

[02:46:20.300 --> 02:46:22.460]
And there is nothing

[02:46:23.540 --> 02:46:27.560]
You will be allowed to say

[02:46:27.560 --> 02:46:29.520]
The heaven's saying

[02:46:31.320 --> 02:46:35.700]
This could be who a silence

[02:46:36.160 --> 02:46:41.660]
Lots 46, the good news is we're going to let all the slipperers from my American and the US on the 1st of June, man

[02:46:41.660 --> 02:46:42.400]
El Hun El

[02:46:43.520 --> 02:46:44.480]
Primo de Hunio

[02:46:44.480 --> 02:46:46.520]
I would have thought that Julio would have been a better match for that

[02:46:46.520 --> 02:46:47.740]
But I wouldn't be bad

[02:46:47.740 --> 02:46:49.900]
El Cinco de Hunio

[02:46:50.360 --> 02:46:51.100]
July 5th

[02:46:51.100 --> 02:46:52.500]
My mother's birthday and I don't know her mom

[02:46:52.500 --> 02:46:54.040]
Happy birthday sweet

[02:46:54.040 --> 02:46:56.340]
And she'll cook all the nice big dinner

[02:46:56.340 --> 02:46:57.060]
Viscuit

[02:46:57.460 --> 02:46:58.580]
72 a.m. Hello

[02:46:59.520 --> 02:47:02.180]
You know, can you tell me how long you have died in the waiting?

[02:47:02.640 --> 02:47:03.960]
They don't they're not in there

[02:47:03.960 --> 02:47:04.660]
They don't show

[02:47:04.660 --> 02:47:05.980]
They don't show at all?

[02:47:06.300 --> 02:47:06.480]
No

[02:47:07.020 --> 02:47:07.920]
Okay, thanks then

[02:47:07.920 --> 02:47:08.580]
You're welcome

[02:47:10.340 --> 02:47:10.740]
5670560

[02:47:13.600 --> 02:47:14.800]
I wonder why that is

[02:47:14.800 --> 02:47:16.400]
Why isn't WLR in ratings?

[02:47:16.720 --> 02:47:17.820]
Are any specializing for that?

[02:47:17.840 --> 02:47:19.700]
No, because they're not a commercial radio station

[02:47:19.700 --> 02:47:20.460]
I don't know why that is

[02:47:20.460 --> 02:47:22.200]
Because they're not a commercial station

[02:47:22.200 --> 02:47:24.520]
There's a lot of people listen to what a lot of people like NPR

[02:47:24.520 --> 02:47:26.460]
And they don't want to hear the Howard's Dirt Show

[02:47:26.460 --> 02:47:28.680]
But the people who are traveling in the Christian radio

[02:47:28.680 --> 02:47:30.140]
They deserve to hear the Howard's Dirt Show

[02:47:30.140 --> 02:47:30.980]
I think that's fabulous

[02:47:30.980 --> 02:47:31.500]
That's karma

[02:47:32.940 --> 02:47:33.400]
That's right

[02:47:33.400 --> 02:47:35.760]
What comes right back up back to you?

[02:47:36.160 --> 02:47:37.020]
That's what Rick Raleigh said

[02:47:37.020 --> 02:47:37.960]
WQA M

[02:47:38.920 --> 02:47:39.280]
25602

[02:47:42.740 --> 02:47:43.700]
25602

[02:47:43.700 --> 02:47:43.700]

[02:47:43.700 --> 02:47:43.700]

[02:47:43.700 --> 02:47:43.700]

[02:47:45.280 --> 02:47:46.240]
Hello?

[02:47:46.540 --> 02:47:47.100]
Yes sir

[02:47:47.100 --> 02:47:47.700]
Neil?

[02:47:48.240 --> 02:47:48.420]
Yeah

[02:47:48.420 --> 02:47:54.480]
Listen, it's dangerous to differentiate between illegal and legal

[02:47:54.480 --> 02:48:00.140]
Because the government will simply give them amnesty and make them legal

[02:48:00.140 --> 02:48:05.340]
We don't want any more immigrants, illegal or illegal

[02:48:05.340 --> 02:48:05.740]
Really?

[02:48:06.740 --> 02:48:09.460]
Sure, it's going to be a quota

[02:48:09.460 --> 02:48:12.580]
We read Pat Buchanan's new book

[02:48:12.580 --> 02:48:14.460]
No, I'm not reading Pat Buchanan

[02:48:14.460 --> 02:48:16.640]
You read it, okay? I read it in Pat Buchanan's book

[02:48:16.640 --> 02:48:17.060]
Okay?

[02:48:17.180 --> 02:48:18.160]
Mr. Zina Fob

[02:48:18.160 --> 02:48:21.500]
He makes your boy Lou Dobbs

[02:48:21.500 --> 02:48:24.360]
He's like the open-border man

[02:48:24.360 --> 02:48:27.280]
Pat Buchanan, my ass, okay?

[02:48:27.720 --> 02:48:27.920]
God

[02:48:28.860 --> 02:48:29.460]
5605

[02:48:30.680 --> 02:48:33.020]
It's all inferners, inferners

[02:48:33.020 --> 02:48:37.000]
We can't be all like Lily White, the royal blue bloods like Pat Buchanan and

[02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:38.640]
it's Mr. Bay which rhymes with you

[02:48:38.640 --> 02:48:39.560]
Get out of here

[02:48:39.560 --> 02:48:41.400]
You fascist bastards you

[02:48:41.800 --> 02:48:44.780]
They ain't no James Buchanan, I'll say to that, our 15th president

[02:48:44.780 --> 02:48:45.980]
Rumor is he was

[02:48:45.980 --> 02:48:48.160]
Yeah, or was it Franklin Pierce? I don't remember where it was

[02:48:48.160 --> 02:48:49.540]
I think it was Billy Pierce

[02:48:49.540 --> 02:48:50.460]
I'm thankful

[02:48:50.460 --> 02:48:52.660]
I always wondered about that in WQA in presidents myself

[02:48:52.660 --> 02:48:54.900]
Yeah, there's guys that wore the powdered wigs

[02:48:54.900 --> 02:48:55.980]
Oh my God

[02:48:56.680 --> 02:48:58.460]
I wonder how Moeward looked in one of those

[02:48:58.460 --> 02:48:59.480]
Don't worry, don't worry

[02:49:00.060 --> 02:49:02.240]
I'll never know because he took a

[02:49:02.240 --> 02:49:02.640]
Powder

[02:49:03.240 --> 02:49:03.500]
That's it

[02:49:03.500 --> 02:49:07.000]
Oh, here's one I always like to face this is signed anonymous

[02:49:07.620 --> 02:49:08.060]
Yeah

[02:49:08.060 --> 02:49:11.620]
The channel for news last night reporting on footy leaving WI-100

[02:49:11.620 --> 02:49:14.320]
They also took great pains to say he wasn't being forced out

[02:49:14.320 --> 02:49:16.280]
They said he wants to continue broadcasting

[02:49:16.280 --> 02:49:19.140]
They mentioned how much older he is than his target audience

[02:49:19.140 --> 02:49:21.580]
Sounds to me like they made him an offer he couldn't refuse

[02:49:21.580 --> 02:49:25.300]
Yeah, he's on WI-100 broadcasting like a teenage years

[02:49:25.300 --> 02:49:26.600]
And he's like a hundred years old

[02:49:27.240 --> 02:49:30.620]
They mentioned that possible replacement could be a syndicated show from New York

[02:49:30.620 --> 02:49:35.660]
As CBS just signed up for new host of the morning show I suspect they're jumping into chance at opian Anthony

[02:49:35.660 --> 02:49:38.480]
Maybe QM should try to grab them before it's sheer a clear show

[02:49:38.480 --> 02:49:40.160]
Oh my God, this guy

[02:49:40.160 --> 02:49:42.500]
This is the funniest facts of all time

[02:49:42.500 --> 02:49:46.980]
Yeah, we're gonna put opian Anthony on you, okay?

[02:49:47.640 --> 02:49:50.600]
I'm sure they love the work with Joyce looking over their shoulder

[02:49:50.600 --> 02:49:53.300]
Okay, we can't even say crap or play a fart sound

[02:49:53.300 --> 02:49:55.680]
And we're gonna put opian Anthony on the air

[02:49:55.680 --> 02:49:58.180]
But this didn't know under your anonymous man

[02:49:58.920 --> 02:50:01.460]
Good, Gally Miss Molly, you just don't get it all

[02:50:01.460 --> 02:50:03.360]
These people think we're fun on them, you know what?

[02:50:03.740 --> 02:50:04.440]
Oh, I know, I know

[02:50:04.440 --> 02:50:05.020]
They don't believe it

[02:50:05.020 --> 02:50:07.340]
They're probably thinking Joyce is a fictional character Joyce fits right

[02:50:07.340 --> 02:50:08.700]
It's with Wicked Bitch in Witch

[02:50:09.240 --> 02:50:11.040]
She is the bane of our existence

[02:50:11.040 --> 02:50:12.900]
And she's the one called all the shots

[02:50:12.900 --> 02:50:15.000]
She's the one writing this place and driving into the ground

[02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:18.920]
Because of Bozo the clown, he's got the testicles of a fruit fly

[02:50:18.920 --> 02:50:22.260]
Oh Joyce, may I? May I? May I do this?

[02:50:22.460 --> 02:50:24.060]
May I, may I? May they? May they?

[02:50:24.200 --> 02:50:26.700]
Somebody get rich and write to call it a may day, okay?

[02:50:26.700 --> 02:50:29.760]
Because once those numbers came out as if we did not renew it

[02:50:29.760 --> 02:50:31.340]
We knew it was May they have QAM

[02:50:31.760 --> 02:50:33.880]
We're gonna have our own demonstration in the streets

[02:50:33.880 --> 02:50:35.820]
I think that I might even fly down for that

[02:50:36.340 --> 02:50:39.880]
All the QAM people passed and present March in the streets in protest

[02:50:39.880 --> 02:50:41.980]
Of the butcher job, man

[02:50:41.980 --> 02:50:43.160]
Hatch its job

[02:50:43.820 --> 02:50:45.000]
How do I express it?

[02:50:45.100 --> 02:50:45.900]
What is there left to say?

[02:50:46.200 --> 02:50:48.480]
Like I said, this is all we can do is the best we can

[02:50:48.480 --> 02:50:49.800]
Under impossible circumstances

[02:50:49.800 --> 02:50:52.460]
And this guy says, oh put opian Anthony on here

[02:50:52.460 --> 02:50:54.180]
You're better grabbed before cheap channelers

[02:50:54.180 --> 02:50:57.140]
Right! These guys are so terrified

[02:50:57.140 --> 02:50:59.180]
They wouldn't put a cookla fran in Ali on here

[02:50:59.180 --> 02:51:01.840]
Because they're afraid that somebody might misinterpret what cookla means

[02:51:01.840 --> 02:51:03.140]
What does it mean?

[02:51:03.380 --> 02:51:04.760]
I don't know, I'm afraid to ask

[02:51:04.760 --> 02:51:06.680]
Call up Joyce if we can interpret it on here

[02:51:06.680 --> 02:51:09.040]
Might be something filthy, something sub-rosa

[02:51:10.800 --> 02:51:12.520]
1347 votes on the pool

[02:51:12.520 --> 02:51:14.520]
How did illegal alien they affect us?

[02:51:14.660 --> 02:51:16.280]
They know that they have immigration

[02:51:16.280 --> 02:51:18.660]
It had nothing whatsoever to do with immigration

[02:51:18.660 --> 02:51:20.580]
Look up immigration as a dictionary

[02:51:20.580 --> 02:51:22.180]
And Lou Dobbs is right about that

[02:51:22.180 --> 02:51:24.740]
I wasn't screaming about it, but I'm before Lou Dobbs was screaming

[02:51:24.740 --> 02:51:26.800]
Did I have what was I talking yesterday on all these channels?

[02:51:27.100 --> 02:51:27.320]
Yes, yes you were

[02:51:27.320 --> 02:51:27.960]
We do the same thing

[02:51:27.960 --> 02:51:31.480]
And by the way, see the legal aliens already had that, Misty

[02:51:31.480 --> 02:51:34.080]
They don't have anything to pitch a fit about

[02:51:34.080 --> 02:51:34.920]
That is correct

[02:51:34.920 --> 02:51:36.460]
They're the ones that were out there protesting

[02:51:36.460 --> 02:51:38.660]
Quit being a professional hoolie, okay?

[02:51:39.220 --> 02:51:40.460]
People on South was eight speed

[02:51:40.460 --> 02:51:42.440]
What are you protesting about for Christ's sakes?

[02:51:42.440 --> 02:51:44.600]
You're in your legal, you got yours cut the crap

[02:51:44.600 --> 02:51:45.120]
That's right

[02:51:45.640 --> 02:51:46.840]
Stop attracting attention

[02:51:46.840 --> 02:51:48.700]
In addition to what you're not fooling us anyway

[02:51:48.700 --> 02:51:51.080]
Because we know the Cubans in the Mexicans hate each other like boys

[02:51:51.080 --> 02:51:52.300]
And so they can anyway

[02:51:52.300 --> 02:51:53.840]
You're the one that taught us that

[02:51:53.840 --> 02:51:54.980]
You're not fooling anyone you know

[02:51:54.980 --> 02:51:57.120]
The Reacons, Cubans hate the Reacons

[02:51:57.120 --> 02:51:58.220]
And the Reacons hate the Cubans

[02:51:58.220 --> 02:51:59.440]
And everybody hates the Mexicans

[02:51:59.440 --> 02:52:00.900]
And the Jews forget about them

[02:52:00.900 --> 02:52:03.180]
You know, it's one big happy family

[02:52:03.180 --> 02:52:04.360]
And I...

[02:52:04.360 --> 02:52:05.940]
Oh Nancy Grace testifies, Fran

[02:52:05.940 --> 02:52:07.060]
Grace, headline for all

[02:52:07.060 --> 02:52:07.840]
Oh Nancy Grace

[02:52:07.840 --> 02:52:10.640]
And then they also got that other Nazi going to be under too

[02:52:10.640 --> 02:52:11.540]
On headline news

[02:52:11.540 --> 02:52:13.720]
The one that's on Chiefs' channel in the morning

[02:52:13.720 --> 02:52:14.440]
What are Glenn Beck?

[02:52:14.760 --> 02:52:16.720]
I keep forgetting, he arrives with Todd Greck

[02:52:16.720 --> 02:52:19.280]
Glenn Beck, he's also going to be on headline news, Fran

[02:52:19.280 --> 02:52:20.140]
Well Fran

[02:52:20.140 --> 02:52:21.920]
I've told you one thing about Nancy

[02:52:21.920 --> 02:52:24.300]
She must be poverty because she's whoever got a lot of friends

[02:52:24.300 --> 02:52:26.800]
This is Neil Roger

[02:52:26.800 --> 02:52:28.120]
What's the Fox News?

[02:52:28.560 --> 02:52:30.960]
Is 5.62 AF

[02:52:32.420 --> 02:52:34.520]
Only in the Banana Republic baby

[02:52:34.520 --> 02:52:35.720]
Only in Miami

[02:52:37.240 --> 02:52:38.200]
That's a movie

[02:52:43.380 --> 02:52:44.480]
Go Black

[02:52:45.800 --> 02:52:47.520]
All the hardburn

[02:52:48.460 --> 02:52:52.860]
Don't know, don't know every time I see

[02:52:52.860 --> 02:52:55.880]
Don't know, don't know

[02:52:55.880 --> 02:52:58.720]
That three-part, it can't win

[02:52:59.680 --> 02:53:01.660]
Don't know, don't know

[02:53:01.660 --> 02:53:03.780]
All my TV

[02:53:04.920 --> 02:53:07.220]
He's President of the ***

[02:53:07.220 --> 02:53:10.240]
Republican Russell is

[02:53:10.240 --> 02:53:12.920]
And in Archangel and Idiot

[02:53:12.920 --> 02:53:14.920]
I don't know why

[02:53:14.920 --> 02:53:18.360]
They wanted one to stop a Nazi

[02:53:18.920 --> 02:53:21.560]
First round of the four years

[02:53:21.560 --> 02:53:22.160]
I'm a gun

[02:53:22.920 --> 02:53:24.020]
President of ***

[02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:25.960]
Republican

[02:53:27.500 --> 02:53:28.460]
Republican

[02:53:28.460 --> 02:53:31.300]
All what I get to

[02:53:31.920 --> 02:53:34.340]
Go vote once more

[02:53:34.340 --> 02:53:38.380]
And get to be your voted vote

[02:53:38.380 --> 02:53:41.060]
All right

[02:53:41.060 --> 02:53:43.920]
Here you want this

[02:53:43.920 --> 02:53:46.440]
Don't know, don't know

[02:53:46.440 --> 02:53:49.620]
It's drumming stupidly

[02:53:49.620 --> 02:53:51.740]
Don't know, don't know

[02:53:52.380 --> 02:53:54.920]
And this wrongly rich kid

[02:53:55.900 --> 02:53:57.660]
Don't know, don't know

[02:53:57.660 --> 02:53:58.240]
He's even

[02:53:58.240 --> 02:54:00.420]
Double in me

[02:54:01.380 --> 02:54:03.340]
He's President of the ***

[02:54:04.380 --> 02:54:06.460]
He has no care what it looks

[02:54:06.460 --> 02:54:09.860]
You got a man by hooker and roll up the Chris

[02:54:10.460 --> 02:54:13.340]
All those words of you and I

[02:54:13.340 --> 02:54:15.000]
But he'll go fear

[02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:17.720]
We've got a great leader here

[02:54:18.460 --> 02:54:20.120]
With President of ***

[02:54:21.080 --> 02:54:21.680]
Republican

[02:54:22.460 --> 02:54:22.620]
Republican

[02:54:23.520 --> 02:54:24.120]
Republican

[02:54:26.680 --> 02:54:28.800]
All right, just got to memo

[02:54:28.800 --> 02:54:30.180]
You're going to be very pleased to see this

[02:54:30.180 --> 02:54:31.680]
You heard of staff infection

[02:54:31.680 --> 02:54:32.760]
Yeah

[02:54:32.760 --> 02:54:34.320]
There's going to be a staff animal

[02:54:34.320 --> 02:54:35.640]
330 to 7 noon

[02:54:35.640 --> 02:54:37.580]
Everybody's reiss mandatory attendance

[02:54:37.580 --> 02:54:38.180]
All right

[02:54:38.180 --> 02:54:40.300]
And I have a blueberry animal for the entire QAM staff

[02:54:40.300 --> 02:54:41.020]
See if that helps

[02:54:41.020 --> 02:54:42.360]
Okay, I'll insert the tube

[02:54:42.360 --> 02:54:43.240]
Here, I'll go

[02:54:43.240 --> 02:54:43.900]
You're welcome

[02:54:43.900 --> 02:54:45.160]
You have to bring your own hose

[02:54:45.160 --> 02:54:46.620]
I don't think I carry one or only

[02:54:46.620 --> 02:54:47.700]
No crack hose

[02:54:48.500 --> 02:54:49.980]
1359 vote on the poll

[02:54:49.980 --> 02:54:52.340]
How did illegal alien day affect you yesterday?

[02:54:52.560 --> 02:54:53.200]
That's our question

[02:54:53.200 --> 02:54:55.620]
Not at all 971, that's my vote

[02:54:56.140 --> 02:54:57.080]
Hubman Drared

[02:54:57.080 --> 02:54:58.740]
71.4%

[02:54:58.740 --> 02:55:00.660]
Much less traffic to 128

[02:55:00.660 --> 02:55:03.100]
Spent extra money just out of spite 69

[02:55:03.660 --> 02:55:04.940]
I hate this poll 25

[02:55:04.940 --> 02:55:06.280]
Didn't go to work 24

[02:55:06.280 --> 02:55:08.200]
Didn't go shopping 17

[02:55:08.200 --> 02:55:10.340]
Didn't open my business 14

[02:55:10.340 --> 02:55:11.060]
Catorce

[02:55:11.060 --> 02:55:13.480]
What do I know my espagnol my numbers or what?

[02:55:13.660 --> 02:55:14.680]
What do you think of it?

[02:55:14.940 --> 02:55:16.200]
A worse traffic 9

[02:55:16.200 --> 02:55:17.500]
And didn't go to school

[02:55:17.500 --> 02:55:18.260]
We got a pair now

[02:55:18.260 --> 02:55:18.880]
Didn't go to school

[02:55:18.880 --> 02:55:20.220]
One guy he did some productive

[02:55:20.220 --> 02:55:22.540]
Anyway, stuck some bumper cigarettes, some busher lover

[02:55:22.540 --> 02:55:25.220]
Nice job, Pally. And by the way, we did trace the call

[02:55:25.220 --> 02:55:27.940]
We put your name and dress you size on here tomorrow

[02:55:27.940 --> 02:55:28.740]
During the show

[02:55:28.740 --> 02:55:30.360]
We are coming back tomorrow, aren't we?

[02:55:30.880 --> 02:55:33.660]
