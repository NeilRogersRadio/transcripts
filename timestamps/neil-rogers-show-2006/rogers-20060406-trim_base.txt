[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180]
Good California to Mexico

[00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.380]
Arizona and New Mexico

[00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.820]
And since your order rings takes to go

[00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.200]
You can grow in Texas too

[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.280]
You can't use a name, many will not breathe anymore

[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.820]
I'm so afraid of attack

[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.920]
But Mexico is not salty, fact

[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.160]
No bombing beaters, but they might instead

[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.900]
Throw 30 sneakers at your head

[00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.840]
Watch your health catch your health catch their attack

[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.920]
Just so they're not just

[00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.120]
They only threat that I can see

[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.260]
We got real problems, serious problems

[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.340]
But no one takes that to the streets

[00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.700]
You give me a jet of load, Dots

[00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.020]
You give me a jet of load, Dots night after night

[00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.340]
With your report on a boypeynut rifle

[00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.860]
Get back to talking to China

[00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.680]
Nobody could have done a fine job

[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.580]
I don't buy food, you want you to buy

[00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.900]
For skies

[00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.560]
I don't do a good buy

[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.040]
Do do do do do do do do do do do

[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.040]
Guys, take a break

[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.940]
It's a 10 a 1 at 5 60 WQI

[00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.300]
I'm happy Thursday April 6

[00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.000]
No crossover today, the Humphors off to do the wood

[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.740]
I mean the wood memorial

[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.020]
The wood?

[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.560]
Okay

[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.040]
The big horse race tomorrow at Saturday

[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.380]
Whatever the hell it is up in New York

[00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.240]
The wood memorial

[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.740]
You better get with it mister

[00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.760]
If you're going to be around on a sports stage

[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.280]
You better start learning your sports

[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.680]
Let's start in a little by little

[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.720]
Yeah, so I know what it's called the hoops

[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.660]
Fomming near in a job shrine kills 10

[00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.080]
Here's some more good news from Iraq

[00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.460]
A car bomb detonated to the inner of the Imam Ali Shrine

[00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.920]
In the job zones and people wanting 39 more

[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.240]
Air every single day

[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.340]
It's just massive bloodshed and nobody cares

[00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.440]
Because the public's really

[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.560]
They're busy they're occupied with important crap

[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.880]
All around the world they got they got bigger fish to fry

[00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.000]
It's like all those people with their Mexican flags

[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.300]
Oh God

[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.840]
The blasted place in Tauedai Square

[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.520]
On a road leading to a cemetery in the

[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.640]
South Central Iraqi city of Vashdam Shiite Islam

[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.140]
Police are on alert have imposed the citywide curfew

[00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.060]
A car bomb killed more than 120 people near the mosque

[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.620]
In August of 2003

[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.460]
Anyway, it's just every single day bodies all over the place

[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.020]
And body parts and blood and stuff

[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.540]
Chaos

[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.000]
But other than that things are going extremely well

[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.840]
Oh, we're fine in Iraq

[00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.820]
Fahrenheit night 11 was on my cable again last night

[00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.980]
And I couldn't I watched about an hour but again

[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.680]
Even though it seemed about 50 times already

[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.980]
Couldn't shut it off and I wondered myself

[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.040]
How could anybody watch that without just being

[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.300]
Without having blood dripping from their lip

[00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.720]
I mean just wild

[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.820]
I guess it America's easy

[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.980]
Public propaganda you know I guess an America's easy to do that when you just don't give it in

[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.880]
Like like that bit said if there were if there was many people protesting and marching in the streets

[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.440]
About important things as opposed to like you know trying to legalize illegal

[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.220]
Immigration then maybe we might get something dumb but I doubt it put Joe Bell on the task he'll take care of it

[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.580]
He'll take that up with the beesleaves

[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.660]
Boy he is just the

[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.480]
Vein of my existence because your buddy though now see how you got that's right. We will remember there for you

[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.720]
Got normal kid after his ass became anybody but I looked at that little chat fans a little soft shoe for you patty on the back

[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.540]
Hey, I like George. We're gonna take that carriage right?

[00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.520]
Thanks, Norm but Greg left me such a mess

[00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.940]
Does this mean I'm gonna get it bill

[00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.120]
Yeah, 58 bucks

[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.640]
Same for me bucks that you got to pay for me yesterday. So here's the deal

[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.600]
The money finally hit the bank there from it was the bank's mistake allegedly from the people aren't getting paid yesterday, right?

[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.160]
But the people who wound up bouncing checks or getting charges or overgrads or whatever you're all on your own

[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.620]
See if it was any kind of an honorable company

[00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.000]
They say oh well, you know if there was any kind of inconvenience or whatever will take care of it

[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.280]
Oh, yeah, right exactly

[00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:10.100]
So you're on your own to love you and don't don't be so irresponsible next time expecting to have that money in there on payday

[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.440]
Here's yesterday's poll result 1853 votes

[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.080]
By the way, we'd have we'd be way ahead of the game on today's poll except for the fact that Eric is also maybe he picked up

[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.420]
What I said yesterday took it too literally when I talk of it to Hank about let's go on strike

[00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.600]
So to totally we were just joking

[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.960]
Yeah, we're just joking Eric. Okay, so when I faxed the poll three different times the idea was

[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.120]
Let's get it on there already. Okay. I didn't want to make the phone call

[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.200]
I added one here. Whoa. I didn't want to hear that just wasn't in the mood for it

[00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:49.840]
So the poll only went on there like shortly before the show this morning otherwise we'd we'd have our chance for a thousand easy on this one today, but no

[00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.860]
No

[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.000]
That's why I fastened the month for tomorrow already

[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.180]
What is this revised the oh, I don't care about that

[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.400]
Oh, look at that. We got courtesy to tend to adjust the Agma

[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.300]
Maybe he got his ass fired for being in there dealing around when I was either one that was like

[00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.760]
In a controller near state in the middle of our show and stuff was going on here. We don't know and I don't think we'll ever know

[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.760]
We'll never know it was you hoody

[00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.160]
But he was definitely the one in there last night poxking around in our studio and using your computer and

[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.580]
There doesn't need to be anybody in their clearance

[00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.780]
There's no reason for anybody to be in that room

[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.480]
There was a really good reason that I don't want it. I was at they had some gamers something

[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.120]
No, they're not in that room. They had something. Yeah

[00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:41.160]
They had a party going on and of course, uh, you know, it doesn't make any difference who it is in there nobody can control because it's kindergarten time

[00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.160]
Welcome to wqa. I'm your radio kindergarten like it's like jumping of the sandbox with us

[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.740]
Give you a little pale in the shovel and you can pretend like we're gonna go on the merry go round again

[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.920]
I'll get around the maple like those little Julios. I'm sure they'll be calling in later, you know

[00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.300]
I can't sit around the maple

[00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.440]
I'm gonna pull

[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.480]
Grab it on the staff of life

[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.700]
What do you believe about Jesus being that that was our pool yesterday? He was one of many self-proclaimed profits 557

[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.700]
Also before I get into the pool result I could stress it out for an hour

[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.900]
Uh

[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.040]
Brett Brett up at home

[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.280]
Wasn't either guy that invented the father the bomb or something like that

[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:23.640]
Uh, don't be listening to fat boy there. Okay. The purpose of your being there is to go out and sell something at a service

[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.640]
The accounts not to piss me off or get me to rip you on a ear right?

[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.800]
We have plenty of other people to rip on the ear go out and do something. Okay?

[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.140]
And don't be putting the piece of copy in here that nobody ever heard of before and then expecting me to update it for you because

[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.580]
Do your job. I know that's very difficult to understand being a hot shot from New York like you are

[00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.420]
But do your job you moron

[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.780]
That's moe ro n moron

[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.640]
From what I'm hearing is that everybody in the building already hates him like poison bread from New York

[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.700]
Not a lot of our crack sales people make sure you mark the tape there Josh you might want to copy that part of the new regime

[00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.980]
Yeah, yeah, you can put that in his resume on his way to next uh his next failure

[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.740]
Jesus was one of many self-proclaimed profits

[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.840]
57 that's 30% of the audience

[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.040]
30 man said that he was the Messiah

[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:08.600]
378

[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:14.040]
20.3% now the last time we did this fall it was much higher than that, but only we only had a few choices

[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.520]
He was the Messiah right uh 33% said that last time

[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:24.140]
So either we're like talking about him or the real Jesus Christ is our gone. Oh wouldn't that be bad

[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:29.800]
He never stole a freight train 251. He strictly for goyam 156 Jesus

[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.020]
He was just a regular guy just like you and I 134

[00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:40.400]
There was never any such person 134. I hate this pool 131. He was a homo

[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.820]
60 you fairy and he was a snappy gracer 52

[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.920]
That's your take on no not on Hank on Jesus. Good play that Hank dropping over. God

[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.520]
He just relentless. No, it's not funny

[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:52.900]
That's funny

[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.360]
Not that. Oh, there's that bubble-headed bitch again sent him a kidney with him

[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:03.200]
Get a real haircut. Okay, if you've got to be a member of congress quit walking around with that frizzy look, you know

[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.160]
No wonder they've got to try to stop her

[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.500]
Looks like it and terrorists to me

[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.800]
Now if you're wondering about Ariel Shiroun since it's almost paysox now

[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.920]
Doctors we attached to piece of Prime Minister Ariel Shiroun's skull yesterday

[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.980]
I wonder if it was Bush's brain maybe like him planning it in his head

[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.960]
A day after the surgery was delayed because of a respiratory infection

[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:32.560]
They reattached the piece of his skull so he is obviously doing extremely well

[00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:38.200]
The operation was the eighth four Shiroun since he suffered that debilitating stroke on the fourth of January

[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.800]
Doctors had removed the pieces sculpturing a previous operation on his brain

[00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.160]
Which they said was loaded with carrot sinus

[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.640]
The surgery that Prime Minister Ariel Shiroun was supposed to have yesterday took place today

[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.120]
And it successfully short-wired to go to hospital seven to statement yesterday

[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:58.460]
Shiroun was taken back to his room in the intensive care unit where he's been hospitalized since his massive stroke

[00:08:58.980 --> 00:08:59.980]
Every day yesterday

[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.940]
It was talking about the vegetables about we need the cheap labor

[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:08.200]
Not evidently Ariel Shiroun don't need any Mexicans to work on his vegetable status

[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.760]
Because that seems to be what he is at this point

[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:17.340]
You see how God works what goes around comes around you want to be a terrorist kill a lot of innocent people

[00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.140]
You want to be a barbarian and then the Lord smites you

[00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.580]
Smotes you right on your hands

[00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:23.620]
bad ass

[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.520]
I don't think there'd be any pacidic he can be for Ariel this uh, Pesah

[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.640]
But you know what can it really hurt when you come right out of it? No

[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.820]
I hear today's poll we've done this one before probably every couple of years we do this

[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.220]
Well, actually we did fairly recently the things that they don't want to hear about

[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.580]
Because they like because it's negative they like that a lot better

[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:50.320]
In fact generally speaking whatever it is I talk about or you talk about that's that's what they don't want to hear

[00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.920]
That's right. They don't know what they do want

[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.780]
But whatever it is that we talk and that's that's not what they want. That's not what they had in mind

[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:05.220]
324 votes. We already have like 700 in some out of Eric wouldn't have been such a tubbiest that they in the really really screwed up bad

[00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.960]
God he frosted my ass

[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.640]
324 of all the things that he'll talk about which is the most interesting to you

[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:13.560]
politics

I am all that South Floridaians have to say to their bicarious desires about glorious tins of town

[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:43.780]
That's why I don't have time to write anything about local personalities

[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.880]
I'm out of touch with that now

[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:49.680]
Why should I write about Neil Rogers or even this 30 of the anniversary

[00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:52.540]
Come on I have more important things to do

[00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:55.880]

1018 at 5.60 WQM so Tommy finally discovered that uh

[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.820]
The big story was Katie Curry

[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:36.580]
He's got 45 columns in last two days about Katie Curry

[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.780]
And then what about Rosie O'Donnell and her

[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:39.400]
Gay cruise

[00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:42.780]
Which time admits in the article he does a little disclosure there

[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:47.940]
Full disclosure that an immediate member of his or a member of his immediate family works for the cruise line

[00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:49.440]
So that's how you need to know right there

[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.060]
Okay

[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:53.580]
All your people out there don't go out host cruises man if you want to come back alive

[00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:56.120]
That's my suggestion to it. It's under for a long time

[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:59.720]
Let's do a quick flurry of call here because I'm sure the audience is whipped up and we're frenzy

[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.600]
Marlon's last night but they give it a good shot there

[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.000]
They tried that big comeback and fell just a little short right

[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.380]
Yes, it did a little short. What was it?

[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.240]
6.5? Yes, they were down 6.1. They made a little

[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.280]
Come back and see any of that

[00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:13.180]
So they aftermath of it

[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:18.320]
In fact, I saw Frank Ford interviewing somebody I thought god since he since he had that big mole removed him with a damn

[00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:21.760]
And then what else and the panthers of course they're all done

[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:26.640]
They got bushwacked by Atlanta 5.2 there and then right in the macarena last night not good

[00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:30.080]
And other than that it's all uh, it's all him

5.6.7.05.60

[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:36.800]
5.6.7.05.60 under Verizon and singular wireless line. I'm just Tommy. I quoted Hank

[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:40.520]
From his show yesterday. See I forgot to ask Hank about Katie Kirk

[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:44.740]
But Hank already spilled the beans about when she used to work at channel four and then there's the whole thing about

[00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:50.120]
She did the story on what was that a montage with Ed O'Dell by the way Ed O'Dell's a big fan of the show Tommy

[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.020]
I hate to break the news to you Ed O'Dell's a good guy. He's good people

[00:16:54.140 --> 00:17:01.000]
But uh, she was on montage and she went out there and she uh to find out what it was like to be a homeless for a bag lady

[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.460]
And she uh sat out there on the street like is a bag lady Katie Kirk

[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:08.980]
And how she's making 15 million years. So maybe she's got a little something to sack for you

[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:14.160]
Maybe Katie Kirk's got 58 bucks for her now George to cover those charges from yesterday when they didn't pay on tarry

[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.100]
I'll go check them does call up Katie. She'll she'll help you out

[00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:25.340]

Apparently he sold it in August. See more paleo of course the founder and uh whatever

[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:53.480]
Uh, I just found out they went by their Saturday and they said there's a scientist that remodeling

But evidently he sold the business at August and uh I get to every folded to with the lesser man and uh

[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:04.840]
Another Southport institution is gone by the court. What does that tell you huh?

[00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:11.200]
Uh, well, it tells me uh the uh the gen files in temperate pines didn't know a good thing

[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:15.620]
That's what it tells me when he go in and pember pines. I thought they were all old Jews in pember pines

[00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:21.420]
Well, uh, maybe it was too far from cemetery of indivisive slutt all the way over to corkies. Maybe that was it

[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:26.840]
I think it was getting past the traffic at temperate pines like small if maybe they didn't have an early bird

[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.100]
Uh, while he didn't have an early bird and uh

I feel another great dish is optic sandwich is no more

[00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:38.140]
Well, not be a great slogan. It's too late for the early bird to corkies

Oh, just a little scrape

[00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:15.020]
WQ a.m. Joe Bell line. Hello. Hello, Neil. How are you? Okay, sir. That's good. Uh yesterday your

[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.360]

Who's at Lucifer things that can you play tydomi for me? Tydomi? Tydomi? Tyad

[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.280]

[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.740]
Staff screwed up your request

[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:38.200]
Talking about the fact that he couldn't hear it because there were playing stuff on the other side of the guys right. Oh, that cracked staff

[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.460]
That's not how you want to be

[00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:44.860]
Whoever I was in there now. I know what you're talking about. All right. I appreciate it

[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:49.280]
No, I'll work something out for you. I'll play Tydomi and then they'll play something over that in the control room

[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:53.320]
We all look make good. No, it's just not right. I don't know what that was going on in there

[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.500]
It's like a schloxville in there schloxville

[00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:58.000]

High school radio not good high school radio, which they've been on for doing it various times

[00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:21.920]
That's what we degenerated into just a bunch of kids running around all oh, oh, here's a knob. Let me let me crank this knob, you know

[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:28.660]
Just like Wayne Greetzky likes to powder his novel. There are too many people twisting too many knobs in that place

[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:29.940]
That's the problem, okay

[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:35.120]
We know when Greg was there he liked to twist a few knobs, but he's supposed to be gone now

[00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:41.960]

I heard you mentioned a couple of times signing off about that pasta and I'm a fat dude that loves to eat and

It's leading. Oh geez

[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:51.500]
Ooh look at that. Well, I didn't get it. I could have got a band-aid, but that would have been too much fun

[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:56.040]
Because that stops it like right off the wall doesn't stop the bleeding, but it stops like the oozing, you know

[00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:58.340]
We can't like on the show to be oozing a little

[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:04.160]
But you have to be oozing or losing. I think we're doing a second part right away here on the land. We are the rest. Oh

[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.520]
Talk about being behind the eight balls

[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:11.040]
Man, this this new way of jeem. They have they are so clueless. It's unbelievable

[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.980]
But you've been taking care of now, so you don't care now. You're in a better mood

[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:19.300]
Maybe the navigation remains to be seen remember. He's got to go to the west coast and that's a different animal over there

[00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.120]

[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.760]
I don't know about that kid, but

[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:36.960]
And then of course he goes over there in a matter what he says. It's like joy's just slap some in the head

[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:40.280]
Just one time like that and you know smacks him back into place

[00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:44.000]
Too much talking smack that's the problem in this joint

Besides why black people are too easy to food anyway. We're not have fried chicken on the menu

Why don't you send more okay?

[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.800]
Here's a fact right off the battle kind of a sour facts for the pool

[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:11.040]
Please add local minis last stop for the politics last gossip if you want gossip read joney flashmons common a hero

[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:16.140]
Okay, it's all a crap, but we don't do a gossip show or Jewish stuff. Oh there you go put Jewish stuff on there

[00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:21.120]
Right okay, and then it goes on this is the part I love in this thanks

[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:25.680]
Also, why is it that you give a report on the this in Iraq every day? What exactly is your point?

[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:32.340]
What what exactly is my point? How about what vaguely is my point that it's a blood bath that we created in addition

[00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:36.540]
Which is is we know you were against going there in the first place? No, not going there isn't the term

[00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:40.900]
It's called invading in the first place based on a pack of lies invading not going there

[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:46.840]
What is it that you want us to do now if we pull out it'll just make things worse if you just try to put out how bad it is

[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:48.820]
There are much worse places such as Darfur

[00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:52.780]
Well, that's what we ought to be doing is telling the Iraqis hey, you know, you think things are bad now

[00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:56.620]
We're gonna send you asked Africa. How do you like that? Darfur is in our fault. We didn't create that

[00:28:56.620 --> 00:29:01.780]
Exactly. It was that way before we didn't go in and invade and and take a place where people were

[00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:02.940]
We're living in relative of the

[00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:07.480]
A decent semblance of a life when you turn it into a blood bath. That's the difference

[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:09.640]
Not that we're doing anything in Darfur

[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:13.660]
That's beyond the cause nobody cares about that because those are dark folks in Africa and nobody cares

[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.200]
That's just the way the world is

[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:23.000]
You know all this crap a lot never again. Right if it's the Jews if it's the Sparks is whoever is we just don't care

[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.280]
That's that's the world for you

[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:27.320]
What exactly is your point? I think the point is pretty clear

[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.340]
Okay, and since the media just kind of like sluffs it off

[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:32.380]
I figure it's just and it only takes a few seconds every day at the beginning of the show

[00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:36.900]
Just likely talk if there's dead American servicemen since the media doesn't feel like the news there anymore anyway

[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:42.360]
Because I want how do you like that because it's my show and because that's what I want

[00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:46.280]
For about 15 20 seconds the beginning of the show every day. How do you like that?

[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:50.920]
Is if I have to owe you an explanation of why I say this and why I do that and why I hate South Florida?

[00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:54.940]
Whoever sent the facts you are part of it. Okay. I'm happy pays off to you

[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:56.960]
Jewish stuff

[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:01.080]
Hope you've gagged on the leftover home intestine from Purim. How do you like that?

[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:03.880]
Why do you do this? Why because I because I want

[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:09.000]
423 votes on the pool. Boy, we'd have a thousand already if we weren't for a Eric

[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:20.440]

[00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:25.220]

[00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:27.320]

[00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:39.440]
Keep right. You know, I put a bandit. I took your advice. I put a bandit on my knee. Yeah

[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:45.940]
Not a good idea. It's all it's all like I can see the gauze is like all bloody now. Oh, you got to keep replacing it

[00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:51.500]
Get out of here. Look at you. That's important to do that. Who can afford to keep replacing band aids man

[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:55.260]
I know you don't wear socks. You're gonna be leaving a blood stain

[00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:58.480]

[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:02.960]

McKinney's running with that police officer a lawyer from anywhere the case had late yesterday

[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:21.480]
You confirmed that federal prosecutors had agreed to get involved in the case in which a black lawmakers accused of

[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:25.720]
hitting a white officer after they tried to stop her for entering a house. See I got news for you

[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:30.380]
Okay, I don't know about you, but I'm sick and tired. Everything is a racial thing if she just would have said

[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:34.280]
Hey, I'm senti McKinney. I remember a congress from Georgia whatever that would have been it

[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:39.840]
It happens all the time they said that but no instead that she liked and she won't discuss what happened either

[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:46.420]
Even totally dead, grilled her about 15 times yesterday morning. They showed the clip and she won't answer the question of what really happened

[00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:47.840]
Because she knows what she did was wrong

[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:53.860]
So in order to elicit sympathy now with that bad frizzy hair do her is she's like oh, it's a racial thing if I would have been white

[00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:55.640]
Yeah, just like with OJ

[00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.800]
I don't know, but I think America is sick of that

[00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:00.140]
We're sick and tired every time some

[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:03.600]
Dark person does some everyone act something that's unacceptable

[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:07.120]
Oh see if a white person wanted that would have been okay. Well, what's that got to do with it

[00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:12.290]
Bullcrant the white person would done they probably would have shot him right

[00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:17.350]
But a black person they realized that that would gotta be a bottom black woman's hair. Oh, god

[00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:19.490]
You know, she looks like she stuck her finger in a light socket

[00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:21.230]
So she could be a terrorist for all we know

[00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:25.830]
Maybe the bad reason that bomb she had ready to go. Maybe that's what got her hair all fizzy like that

[00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:31.650]
Get yourself a real and she had no name tag on like this guy's supposed to know her with her new do

[00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:35.110]
She's got a new do they got a no mouth face. Yeah

[00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:38.750]
Well, I don't want to know your face. I don't like that honey. Go back to Joj. You bitch

[00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:44.370]
God air everything like with OJ murders two people in cold blood all the DNA evidence

[00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:48.930]
It's it's as plain as could be even Charlotte Holmes didn't need to be called in for that one

[00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:52.390]
And it's a racial thing. Yeah, right

[00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:53.590]
Of course it was

[00:33:56.890 --> 00:33:57.290]
5670560

[00:33:57.750 --> 00:34:03.690]
Palm five 60 in the Verizon singular wireless lines. They're real quiet because it's coming up to pay soft and Eastern O for it

[00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:07.530]
And they're really pissed off because I chastise them for that ass Wednesday thing

[00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:12.090]
I still don't believe that that people really do that. I think you made that up just aggravate

[00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:18.090]
That's what I did that living and breathing people with IQ larger than their digit actually put asses asses

[00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:22.730]
Asses on their forehead on ass Wednesday just because some getski told them to do that

[00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:27.250]
What if they told you to put pomegranates on your forehead when you do that? Oh

[00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:31.750]
You know pomegranate Thursday isn't that what's today? I think that this is today

[00:34:33.090 --> 00:34:36.570]
For a couple of cum quads on your forehead today. It's a cum quad Thursday

[00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:44.450]
All right, couple of a couple of sour grapes on top of your head on one in each ear because it's a grape Thursday

[00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:52.910]
She's I mean you people out there when you're gonna start using your brain get a search party and find one and see if it works find when that works

[00:34:54.930 --> 00:34:56.870]
Shmeer in their forehead with ashes and

[00:34:57.390 --> 00:35:01.930]
And what's supposed to be this significance of that I pardon my ignorance, but I'm not big on the grime stuff

[00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:05.730]
What was that supposed to mean you know, I'm really not sure

[00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:11.090]
Don really now Josh. I don't know. He's a good Catholic help me out here. Yeah, sorry. I uh

[00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:15.250]
You don't know what the shmere because they call it ass Wednesday

[00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:20.330]
You're supposed to smear asses on your forehead on ass Wednesday. You don't even know why perhaps it's showing respect

[00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:26.470]
I have no idea. I'm showing respect. I don't know nor do I care really hey

[00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:29.850]
You better care man. You want your belt to take care of your deal

[00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:32.270]
This is me no Roger

[00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:34.430]
What mustn't it now?

[00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:41.230]
That the Lord even loves me or Rogers

[00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:53.130]
Everybody's going back to see me. It's moving now

[00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:59.930]
As he's moving about the crucifixion just get past the violence for movies come back now

[00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:03.930]
And he's going see the crucifixion

[00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:07.210]
Don't worry when there is only fair

[00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:11.030]
Making this movie was not crossing fair

[00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:15.530]
So come on come on watch the crucifixion with me

[00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:22.550]
Do you ever wish that your family and friends knew their Bible versus better?

[00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:29.650]
Absolutely. I have the answer to your prayers from the makers of you saint my martyr comes again the whole family can enjoy

[00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:30.890]
crucifixion

[00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:37.670]
crucifixion is not just fun to play but it forces everyone to know their Bible and it's easy to play first

[00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:43.070]
Someone picks a word or phrase from the Bible and the rest of the group takes turns trying to spell it

[00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:48.290]
But be careful if you pick a wrong letter your little Jesus doll gets nailed

[00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:52.150]
I'll take the dust um how about a chair?

[00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:53.710]
No sorry Billy

[00:36:56.370 --> 00:37:00.110]
After three nails and one spear to the chest everyone loses

[00:37:00.110 --> 00:37:03.010]
But don't worry in three days you can play again

[00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:07.890]
So run down to your local crucifixion toy store and grab up your very own copy of crucifixion

[00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:12.150]
Why not play tonight comes with the small Jesus doll nails in a tiny spear fake blood

[00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:16.410]
Wouldn't cross a hammer not included crucifixion a product of Trinity brothers

[00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:22.790]
1045 so rather than listen a bunch of uh fairy tales I looked it up myself you know sometimes

[00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:27.910]
I was googred at tip I done it ash Wednesday the hell come on you know about it in cyclopedia

[00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:32.330]
Although my margin again I'm having a margin problem here. I don't want to do that on the earth from

[00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:35.610]
I'll do it with that the right hand margin is like job and off

[00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:39.170]
The Wednesday after Queen Quagy Sema

[00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:39.230]
uh

[00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:41.850]
Sunray

[00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:44.870]
Which is the first day of the uh lent fast

[00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:50.210]
What tells that Queen Quagy Sema what what is that what I don't even know a language that

[00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:54.510]
I don't know how to uh probably that might that must be the name deace

[00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:59.090]
Scenarium day of ashes which adheres in the Roman Missile is found in the earliest existing copies of the

[00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:04.410]
Gregorian sacramentary that's named after Jeff Gregory and probably dates from at least the eighth century

[00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:09.390]
Oh, they really knew their craft back then on this day all the faithful according to ancient

[00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:14.090]
Customers are resorted to approach the altar before the beginning of mass and they're the priest the priest

[00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:17.090]
And of course we all know about the priest

[00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:24.370]
Dipping a stomach ashes previously blessed marks the forehead or in case of clerics upon the place of the tansurer

[00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:26.510]
Well, well, what is the tansurer?

[00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:30.150]
Okay, you got the encyclopedia page TOS you are e

[00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:35.590]
About each of these signs of the Torah saying the words remember man though our dust and unto dust shall return

[00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:36.730]
But I mean put a moop at about

[00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:42.670]
The ashes used in the ceremony are made by burning the remains of palms blessed on Palm Sunday the previous year

[00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:47.310]
In the blessing of ashes all four prayers are used all of them ancient

[00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:51.670]
The ashes are sprinkled with water been fumigated with incense and

[00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:55.670]
Peppermints the Sullivan himself the ebishop or

[00:38:55.670 --> 00:39:00.130]
Cardinal receives either standing received it the ashes from some other priest usually the

[00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:03.770]
Highest and dignity of those present and earlier ages a penitential

[00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:08.390]
Procession often followed the right of the distribution of the ashes, but now this is not prescribed

[00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:15.230]
There can be no doubt that the precedent is stripping the ashes to all the faithful erosion made devotional imitation of the practice

[00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:18.130]
Observed in the case of public pay up pentonance

[00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:24.410]
But this devotional usage of reception of sacramental which is something okay. This does make any sense

[00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:33.810]
In the books both of the old law and in the new that the men who repented of their sins be strewed themselves with ashes and

[00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:38.610]
Clowed their bodies with sack cloth or there we go with that sack cloth and ashes crap again like our bill

[00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:43.590]
Now let us do this little at the beginning of our length that we stew ashes upon our heads to

[00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:46.490]
Signify that we ought to repent our sins during glit and fast

[00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:52.270]
That's what that's what they say and then he enforces the recommendation by the terrible example of man versus

[00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:53.190]
Something or other

[00:39:53.830 --> 00:40:00.130]
Oh a man who refused to go to church for the ashes on ash Wednesday and who a few days after was accidentally killed in a bore hunt how boring

[00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:05.810]
It is possible the notion of penance which is suggested by the right of ash Wednesday was reinforced by the figurative

[00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:10.190]
Exclusion from the sacred mystery symbolized by the hanging of the Lenton veil before the sanctuary

[00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:15.950]
But on this and the practice of the beginning of the past ash Wednesday it says see the length can that be lent

[00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:18.750]
I've said that before and the answer is usually not always though

[00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:24.270]
Can that be lent how about what kind of materials I made or can that be felt and every now and any get like either

[00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:25.210]
Yes or

[00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:27.170]
One of the other

[00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:32.870]
5 6 7 0 5 60 you see if they religious show maybe we were learning about religions man

[00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:36.370]
We're learning about all these foolish things that people do because somebody told them to do it

[00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:41.310]
Just go to the cliff there and jump just jump as high as you can the Lord will catch you on the way down

[00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:45.690]
Oh, I guess maybe he was busy. Oh, he was busy checking the odds in that ballgame this weekend like

[00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:47.330]
Sorry

[00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:51.010]
The hand of the Lord should reach out and catch you know when you think

[00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:57.970]
If you can learn it will take care of that 58 bucks that you got screwed. You know they might be useful only god really take care of your charges right

[00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:00.370]
5 6 7 0 5 60

[00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:04.350]
Conn in fact, I know what it says on the door there if you work for the beeslees god help you

[00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:09.630]
I think that's what it says and pound 5 60 on the or does it say you haven't got a prayer one of the other

[00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:11.670]
Verizon singular wireless lines

567 0 5 60 we're I think we just take calls today. I got a whole pile of stuff

[00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:16.130]

[00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:22.530]
Joe Bell

[00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:26.450]
He's like he's like a statue man you can't move him for lover money

[00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:28.650]
But once Norma makes a phone call all of a sudden

[00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:32.570]
He reminds me a little bit of that one too

[00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:36.750]
In fact George told me off the air he didn't want me to sit on here that when Joe Bell came in he

[00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:37.430]
Said to George

[00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:44.910]
Nobody said I see a lot of similarities there, you know a lot of blue and smoke

[00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:49.990]
WQ a.m. Hello, I'm gonna yes sir. Okay. Bye-bye and by the way

[00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:55.030]
There's another one for you. No, where's the charge Reverend Schmuck WQ a.m. Hello

[00:42:56.170 --> 00:42:59.490]
Hi, yes, well we're at it. Can we find out why Catholics?

[00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:03.370]
Can't eat meat on Fridays because that's the dumbest thing I ever heard of anything

[00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:06.490]
But they changed their mind on that because they got started to tune in macaroni

[00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:12.190]
But I have a co-work of a square's bite and I'd like to say that today. Oh is it a woman or a man?

[00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:18.050]
A man and he swears by it and I'd like to know ass George is it actually written in the Bible? Of course not

[00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:19.270]
Okay

[00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:24.530]
Tell Tony a rug guide area went out with knickers. Okay, so I'm a went out with Pat Boone and white bucks

[00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:29.890]
Okay, but look it up for me and let me know okay. I'll live that up to macaroni and cheese

[00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:35.490]
Please I remember when I was in school the Catholic kids it was Friday. Oh gee. We got to have macaroni until I

[00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:39.970]
To the casserole again. Oh, Jesus Christ. Yeah, well. He's the one that told you to do it

[00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:44.930]
But he didn't let me say it again. I have no idea why that was it just it's it. I mean

[00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:51.690]
Make stuff up right that's what you make stuff of it just like that crap about it with the dietary laws from a thousand

[00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:55.530]
The years ago when the Jews didn't want to eat pork because they were getting tricky noses

[00:43:56.630 --> 00:44:02.070]
I'm telling you man. That's what it's all about. That's why the Jews and the Italians had the big noses because they were eating a pork

[00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:07.610]
Uncured uncooked. They didn't have ovens that were real good. I had no microwaves back then the refrigeration

[00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:11.290]
That's correct and so as a result, and that's why the milk products in the dairy products

[00:44:11.290 --> 00:44:17.570]
They get like agita from that they like get through the green apple wild step. Oh, yeah green step the wild apple green step

[00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:20.950]
That's where that name green steam came from

[00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:28.290]
All this stuff. I mean here. It's 20th the year 2006 for Christ's sake if you pardon that expression

[00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:33.350]
Jesus got almighty and there's all these millions of morons

[00:44:33.350 --> 00:44:35.430]
See like that one there

[00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:41.150]
Running around the doing stuff because some geckos thousand years ago were ignorant or because they had done

[00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:45.350]
Didn't have no refrigeration no sanitation no antibiotics none all of these

[00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:46.170]
things

[00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:52.510]
Just like these clowns. Oh, we're gonna kosher that house and you know there's only one question for that

[00:44:53.050 --> 00:44:58.250]
Why remember that? Oh, yeah, Cheryl at IOD our former friend there Cheryl

[00:44:58.250 --> 00:45:04.150]
Jewish Cheryl sent her kid off to a kaboots in Israel which first of all why would you want to do that unless you want to get rid of the kid

[00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:05.010]
I guess the juifier

[00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:09.970]
Yeah, and so when she comes back from Israel because she had been so duly brainwashed over there

[00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:13.950]
Oh, we're gonna kosher the house this weekend and of course that didn't lie that last about five minutes

[00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:15.990]
Got to be kind of a pain in the glass

[00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:23.910]
God stop doing such nonsense because somebody tells you to do it. Okay, and all you geckos out there all you

[00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:29.830]
Hasitam man would have beards out of your kneecap at least use a little left guard and a little right guard

[00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:33.890]
Christ almighty and one of the glamour getting upset

[00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:40.110]
Little a little botanian now that you don't have to worry about dropping the soap now that we got body wash

[00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:46.370]
I mean once upon a time that was a good excuse although they have seen them never need an excuse about dropping a soap because they were reproducing like rabbits

[00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:51.550]
That's another reason why do you notice the Catholic church in their view on this immigration thing the Pope

[00:45:51.550 --> 00:45:55.150]
Oh, he wants the Mexicans all the right and American flooding into this country

[00:45:56.070 --> 00:46:01.370]
Yet because instead of 300 million people we can have like three billion people in about five years away that they were produced

[00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:08.430]
Because in a fact they're good catlicks man. They listen when the Pope speaks they're like you feel fall to the orders and they do they go step right along

[00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:10.730]
All were shluppers

[00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:17.410]
And of course you noticed though I didn't I was never where that until this led latest because I mean whoever paid attention to ragheads, you know

[00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:22.350]
Right, but now we find out the Muslims reproduce like rabbits as well

[00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:28.330]
That's why I like you know all of those Muslim countries like more than 50 pop and percent of population is under 15

[00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:34.330]
Because they're making babies like like like they're cranking out in a factory somewhere when in doubt they're cranking them out

[00:46:35.590 --> 00:46:40.590]
Then that a guy last night on the squeal of fortune this jar-complexed guy got like seven kids

[00:46:42.250 --> 00:46:45.250]
Seven kids this guy like maybe 35. He's got seven kids

[00:46:46.850 --> 00:46:50.010]
Pats as I guess you do get home on leave fairly often then huh and

[00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:55.150]
Every way yeah, yeah, I like that. Yeah, cuz we know I like heavy humor on that show just like a little stuff

[00:46:55.150 --> 00:46:59.550]
Few yucks not not don't want overdo it Pat because then we'll respect it all the time

[00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:03.570]
She's he and vanna are perfect for that show cuz basically they do nothing

[00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:07.490]
You know what I mean? Oh, I don't she hits the letters and uh, you know

[00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:12.250]
It appears that when she hits it, I don't know if that really works or not. I don't think she has anything to do with it

[00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:16.490]
No, I don't use it. Go wait they wait for it actually they wait for it to touch it by the way

[00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:21.590]
She's almost 60 years old vanna. She's 57 he's 59 we discussed that a couple weeks ago. Look right everybody

[00:47:21.590 --> 00:47:24.310]
I tell that to her. Oh my god. How did you find that out?

[00:47:24.310 --> 00:47:30.430]
Ha ha ha ha we Google it. How did you find that out? It's a big it's an ancient Chinese secret

[00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:33.230]
Oh brother

[00:47:34.070 --> 00:47:37.830]
Yeah, let me tell you just like if you want to tell how old somebody is look at their feet

[00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:41.990]
I always wondered why you were like so obsessed had this foot fetish look at their feet

[00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:46.550]
You can ask for the face you can like it's kind of hard to get a foot lift, you know

[00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:48.970]
You can get a facelift you get a nose job

[00:47:49.650 --> 00:47:50.790]
You ever get a foot job?

[00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:01.590]
This is the Neil Roger show

[00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:07.250]
Any questions

[00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:21.390]
And the powers you've got

[00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:26.170]
Since you say his life with your sliding

[00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:30.050]
Oh

[00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:43.170]
You have a brand new style too

[00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:46.930]
We love the way you want your do

[00:48:50.570 --> 00:48:53.730]
the

[00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:53.830]
O

[00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:04.930]
you

[00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:06.810]
Move to see

[00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:08.290]
We need a good sound.

[00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:12.250]
Send the bad guy straight to hell.

[00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:17.030]
When a building starts to blow, we go to the east and we go.

[00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:20.230]
You're a crushing cry with one mighty blow.

[00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:23.410]
That's what they told you.

[00:49:28.930 --> 00:49:29.410]
Oh!

[00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:35.550]
With one mighty mower, was that one mighty blow?

[00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:35.690]
Or was that one mighty blow?

[00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:36.750]
He said, mower, was that a thing?

[00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:38.990]
It's 11 o'clock at 560.

[00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:40.670]
It's a safe sponsor of terror.

[00:49:41.310 --> 00:49:46.490]
WDQA, and there's the number one terrorist in the world right there along with his buddy in partner in crime Tony Blair.

[00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:48.370]
And Jack Straw.

[00:49:49.610 --> 00:49:55.050]
Well, I'd say that we'd be really kicking ass if we had a good start if we just stared at pull last night around 5 or 6 when I wanted to.

[00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.390]
Eric?

[00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:57.910]
509 votes on the pull.

[00:49:58.010 --> 00:50:03.090]
Wait till next time Eric sends me one of those bandwidth bills, a monthly bill, and just wait.

[00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:09.210]
The pony's going to have wild diarrhea that day's going to take a real long slow trip down into Orlando, Eric.

[00:50:09.930 --> 00:50:13.110]
And then of course, Eric will turn around and say, well, just wait till next time you look at your website.

[00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:14.350]
It's not there anymore.

[00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:16.570]
That's a thought, Josh.

[00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:21.470]
Just imagine all the tourists in time would say, was, how we doing on that fundraiser by the way, George?

[00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:22.150]
How's that thing coming?

[00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:23.310]
Oh, I haven't asked.

[00:50:23.590 --> 00:50:26.030]
Man, that thing must be really kicking some serious ass.

[00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:27.170]
That the world aren't far.

[00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:31.790]
So I did look this up and that woman had called him in and she was me by 5 bucks for a flash paper.

[00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:35.890]
Do you ever start facking something and you had no idea how long the thing was on the other?

[00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:38.890]
And then it said page one of 175 or something like that.

[00:50:39.010 --> 00:50:41.530]
A board, I finally stopped the damn thing after several pages.

[00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:44.170]
Some Getki wrote this.

[00:50:44.330 --> 00:50:50.830]
He says in an earlier article, I posted a detailed examination of the never constant discipline of Catholic fasting in absence, never constant.

[00:50:51.570 --> 00:50:53.610]
In this study, I shall raise but a few additional points.

[00:50:54.530 --> 00:51:00.050]
When I was young in Catholic, the priest and nuns in my parish stressed self-mortification or is that self-gratification?

[00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:01.590]
That's what the priests were stressing.

[00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:04.790]
Struff mortification through fasting and abstinence.

[00:51:05.250 --> 00:51:11.830]
One could either drink absolutely nothing from midnight till an hour after Sunday mass if he wished to take communion.

[00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:18.010]
No meat on Fridays, Embour days, or our Rogation days, Holy Days of Obligation.

[00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:24.210]
These are good ass Wednesday, good Friday, Holy Saturday, nor an additional day each week of length.

[00:51:24.930 --> 00:51:26.810]
There were exceptions to these strict rules, of course.

[00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:30.510]
Abstinence wasn't required on Sunday, even if a Holy Day of Obligation fell on Sunday.

[00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:37.810]
The rule seemed so complicated and so subject to change that one was grateful to have the priest to remind him of his fasting-slash-optimed obligations,

[00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:42.330]
lest he inadvertently fail to keep one of the precepts of the church and be guilty of mortal sin.

[00:51:43.570 --> 00:51:45.430]
I'm getting choked. See, Lord, it's punishing me.

[00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:47.370]
Must be my knee. That'll learn yet.

[00:51:48.070 --> 00:51:51.530]
The laws of fast and abstinence have changed significantly over the years, which is interesting.

[00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:54.690]
One considers the Roman Church's motto, Semper Edem.

[00:51:55.710 --> 00:51:56.570]
Always the same.

[00:51:58.190 --> 00:51:58.990]
Semper Edem.

[00:51:59.450 --> 00:52:00.190]
Always the Edem.

[00:52:01.810 --> 00:52:08.810]
No doubt the Catholic Apologists will be quick to remind us that fasting and abstinence are matters of church discipline and as such our subject to revision from time to time.

[00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:10.090]
He would, of course, be correct.

[00:52:10.510 --> 00:52:13.550]
I was able to find no dog were concerning the Lenten-Fasting Revenant absence.

[00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:17.450]
No divine commandist believed as a matter of faith by all Catholics under threat of an asthma.

[00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:20.450]
So why do Catholics believe it necessary to keep the law fast and abstinence?

[00:52:21.350 --> 00:52:24.970]
Aha! Now we've come to the long-convoluted answer that goes on for 400 pages.

[00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:27.290]
Oh, it's even got some biblical quotes. All right.

[00:52:27.970 --> 00:52:30.430]
Lay it on us. God gave Moses 10 utterances.

[00:52:31.810 --> 00:52:33.150]
You know what the first one was?

[00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:34.810]
Yes.

[00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:37.210]
Let's see you step down.

[00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:39.010]
Yes. Sorry.

[00:52:39.570 --> 00:52:41.690]
Or commandments to pass along to the Hebrew people.

[00:52:41.830 --> 00:52:44.610]
The Hebrew people. Not to go, I'm the Hebrew people. You better get with it.

[00:52:44.610 --> 00:52:48.370]
Yeah, you too. You better make yourself right with the Lord, Mr. Ubutcher.

[00:52:48.850 --> 00:52:51.050]
You murdered. That's a judge. Yeah, just this.

[00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:56.810]
Over time you expanded these utterances to include 613 laws that were binding in all Jews.

[00:52:57.150 --> 00:53:01.610]
Violations of these laws were sins. You better go home and kosher your houses right now while you sinners.

[00:53:02.730 --> 00:53:04.170]
Here is Sarnorthite how to do it.

[00:53:05.290 --> 00:53:09.890]
The Lord God, in fact, that's why you don't have time to service any accounts or sell any either because he's busy koshering the house.

[00:53:10.170 --> 00:53:10.970]
He's koshering the world.

[00:53:11.770 --> 00:53:16.090]
The Lord God expected obedience and establish specific punishments for violation of the various laws.

[00:53:16.410 --> 00:53:20.170]
See, there's that song again, Billy and R.B.R. theme song, Billy J. Cramer, Little Children.

[00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:22.430]
Only little children would listen to crap like that.

[00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:26.650]
He expected obedience. See, they're like, oh, yeah, you got to obey the Lord.

[00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:29.130]
You're all going to burden him. You're going to die someday.

[00:53:29.290 --> 00:53:30.430]
I'm doing it over here.

[00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:32.490]
I've done everything God has ever told me to do.

[00:53:32.810 --> 00:53:32.990]
Yeah.

[00:53:33.690 --> 00:53:36.510]
These punishments range from monetary fines to the death penalty.

[00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:38.430]
God has merciful high, high ever.

[00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:42.630]
And he provided means to make a tome to avoid the more severe tasked items of the law.

[00:53:43.610 --> 00:53:49.590]
The Roman Catholic Church in this play of hubris established its own set of commands, the six precepts of the church.

[00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:52.330]
Hubris, in other words, they had some a stink in there to do that.

[00:53:53.610 --> 00:53:59.910]
In fact, I think one of the earlier Jewish princes, yeah, one of the old Jewish Israeli princes has said,

[00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:02.070]
that he has a lot of Christ's power.

[00:54:02.370 --> 00:54:06.050]
The Roman Catholic Church had six precepts of the church, just like the God's commandments.

[00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:08.570]
The precepts of the Roman cult also carry penalties.

[00:54:08.850 --> 00:54:09.990]
Oh, I love this. The Roman cult.

[00:54:11.090 --> 00:54:14.770]
To die without atoning for a violation of one of God's laws is to be damned for all eternity.

[00:54:15.110 --> 00:54:15.490]
Damn it.

[00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:20.190]
So also it's with those who die without absolution for breaking one of the RCC's precepts.

[00:54:20.290 --> 00:54:20.850]
The RCC.

[00:54:21.150 --> 00:54:22.590]
Ha, ha, ha, this is good stuff.

[00:54:22.850 --> 00:54:25.790]
That's like the RCC MP, but that's not like some even like you guys.

[00:54:26.530 --> 00:54:30.550]
According to the RCC, the Roman Catholic Church, to commit murders of mortal sin,

[00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:34.390]
to commit adulteries of mortal sin, to violate one of the precepts of mortal sin.

[00:54:34.650 --> 00:54:38.650]
You see, the Catholic Church set itself on a par with God himself for to break her laws,

[00:54:38.770 --> 00:54:40.330]
carries the same penalties to break his laws.

[00:54:40.830 --> 00:54:43.390]
This does not bring to mind the kind of Lucifer's fall from grace.

[00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:46.670]
How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, the son of the morning?

[00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:49.430]
How art thou cut down to the ground which didst waken the nations?

[00:54:49.810 --> 00:54:50.930]
We can. Waken and weakened.

[00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:53.950]
Didst. For thou hast said in thine heart,

[00:54:54.050 --> 00:54:56.810]
I will ascend in the heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God.

[00:54:57.370 --> 00:54:58.410]
That's still God.

[00:54:58.690 --> 00:55:01.430]
I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the size of the north.

[00:55:01.690 --> 00:55:03.550]
I will ascend above the heights of the clouds.

[00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:06.250]
I'll be like the most high. That's what Georgia is trying to be.

[00:55:07.090 --> 00:55:09.530]
Yet thou shalt be brought down and held to the sides of the pit.

[00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:11.790]
That's from Isaiah 14, 12-15.

[00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:14.310]
The Catholic Apologies.

[00:55:14.570 --> 00:55:16.330]
I say, I'm still trying to find out about the me.

[00:55:16.350 --> 00:55:17.030]
Oh, here we go.

[00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:18.510]
No, I still can't find it.

[00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:23.050]
About the another one.

[00:55:23.290 --> 00:55:25.850]
Basically what this is all about is they just made it up as they went along.

[00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:26.490]
Here you go.

[00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:29.150]
Some Catholic Apologists might declare that it was never a sin,

[00:55:29.290 --> 00:55:31.130]
certainly not a mortal sin to eat meat on Fridays.

[00:55:31.890 --> 00:55:36.470]
After all they might say this was just a church discipline that some overly pious Catholics may have thought was a sin.

[00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:39.890]
I really like the forthright manner that noted Catholic theologian in church history.

[00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:42.070]
And John D.D. deals with this objection.

[00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:43.630]
I wonder if he's akin to D.D. sharp?

[00:55:44.730 --> 00:55:47.330]
John D.D. D.Y.

[00:55:48.550 --> 00:55:50.730]
This is an old argumentative tactic.

[00:55:51.070 --> 00:55:55.930]
One encountered frequently in defensive Catholic strategies to explain a way changed by denying the a-change in fact is occurred.

[00:55:56.910 --> 00:55:58.630]
It's kind of like a Galileo.

[00:55:58.670 --> 00:55:59.690]
He used to be a bad guy now.

[00:55:59.830 --> 00:56:00.910]
He never still afraid to bring.

[00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:06.270]
The denial may hold up as an accurate in some instances, but not so far as the old Friday-Apton's rules concern.

[00:56:06.810 --> 00:56:16.030]
The Gilmore Society's 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia complete with Nehill Obstant and imprimatur from John Cardinal Farley of New York.

[00:56:16.030 --> 00:56:17.230]
O Cardinal Farley!

[00:56:17.830 --> 00:56:19.110]
Hey, Father Farley!

[00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:24.770]
And once the definitive source of Catholic information was unequivocal on the obligation to abstain from meat on Fridays.

[00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:32.090]
Text of theology and catacasins of Christian doctrine indicates that the obligation of abstaining from an element in one of the commandments of the Church.

[00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:35.330]
Satisfaction for a sin is an item of primary importance and more order.

[00:56:35.590 --> 00:56:38.670]
So in other words, I guess and say you could like depends on the kind of meat we're talking about.

[00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:41.590]
You could do without sex on Friday or without eating meat.

[00:56:42.610 --> 00:56:45.150]
How can you actually not even go there?

[00:56:45.250 --> 00:56:56.830]
Naturally, I have abstinence contributes no small share to the realization of this and as a consequence the law of abstinence embodies a serious obligation whose transgression objectively considered or nearly involves a mortal sin.

[00:56:57.850 --> 00:57:00.410]
All the sinning, all the time and everything is a sin.

[00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:02.610]
If you fart the wrong flavor, it's a sin.

[00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:05.350]
Joyce will certainly punish your ass, especially if it gets on the ear.

[00:57:06.370 --> 00:57:14.810]
The unanimous verdict of theologians, the constant practice of the faithful in the mind of the Church placed this point beyond CAVI, I have no idea what that word is.

[00:57:15.030 --> 00:57:15.490]
CAVI, what no?

[00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:16.850]
CAVI, I L.

[00:57:18.010 --> 00:57:18.370]
Cobble.

[00:57:19.530 --> 00:57:21.510]
Cobble runs with an anti-stand.

[00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:31.150]
They who would minimize the character of this obligation so as to relegate all transgressions such as its originating content to the category of venial sin are anatomatized by Alexander VII.

[00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:35.110]
So there you have it, it says, yeah, there we have it.

[00:57:35.730 --> 00:57:41.930]
It is a commandment of the Aromen Catholic Church that all Catholic faithful conformed laws of fasting, abstinence, less than the ability of a mortal sin.

[00:57:42.970 --> 00:57:47.530]
Does anything in here about macaroni and cheese or even tuna noodle casserole which I am in that bag?

[00:57:48.330 --> 00:57:54.810]
You know, tuna noodle casserole, if you put in the oven and you like brown it until it's like, you bake it until it's like a little bit over baked almost burned on top.

[00:57:55.050 --> 00:57:55.210]
Right.

[00:57:55.570 --> 00:57:55.990]
Oh yeah.

[00:57:56.310 --> 00:57:56.650]
Isn't it good?

[00:57:56.910 --> 00:57:57.290]
That's good.

[00:57:57.770 --> 00:57:58.130]
That's the best.

[00:57:58.130 --> 00:57:58.490]
Mmm.

[00:57:59.310 --> 00:58:01.290]
And I think you will go to hell if you too much of that.

[00:58:01.710 --> 00:58:02.510]
I'm going there anyway.

[00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:03.850]
Maybe you're training the police.

[00:58:03.890 --> 00:58:04.850]
Oh, I know he's going to hell.

[00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:05.470]
I'll pack a load.

[00:58:05.590 --> 00:58:05.770]
Sure.

[00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:07.690]
If there's a hell I guarantee you, he'll be first online.

[00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:08.510]
To the tactics.

[00:58:08.930 --> 00:58:09.550]
Oh God.

[00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:14.230]
Of all the things that Neal talks about which is most interesting to you, I think religion is my choice.

[00:58:15.550 --> 00:58:16.070]
I put in the hall.

[00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:20.270]
You know, religion came at a very strong third the first time we did this poll with 20%.

[00:58:20.270 --> 00:58:23.770]
Now it's way down there because the religion one that we chased them all away.

[00:58:23.770 --> 00:58:26.170]
Or maybe we've converted everybody.

[00:58:27.050 --> 00:58:27.730]
534 votes.

[00:58:27.850 --> 00:58:28.490]
What a shame, Eric.

[00:58:28.650 --> 00:58:31.630]
We could have made a thousand easy today if you wouldn't have been, if you wouldn't have been eaten

[00:58:31.630 --> 00:58:33.610]
below any sandwiches with peanut butter and jelly.

[00:58:34.330 --> 00:58:36.910]
I was just joking about that yesterday right all afternoon.

[00:58:37.070 --> 00:58:40.710]
He was eaten below any sandwiches with extra crunchy peanut butter and jelly.

[00:58:42.210 --> 00:58:43.310]
Just think about that.

[00:58:43.490 --> 00:58:44.550]
Do you think of anything more disgusting?

[00:58:45.870 --> 00:58:46.890]
Oh, not at the moment.

[00:58:47.090 --> 00:58:48.990]
Other than Neal may be tripe or head cheese.

[00:58:49.410 --> 00:58:49.650]
Ooh.

[00:58:50.730 --> 00:58:51.450]
Politics 249.

[00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:52.930]
They want to hear a lot of bush fashion.

[00:58:52.930 --> 00:58:54.110]
Confining elements.

[00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:54.670]
Yeah.

[00:58:55.510 --> 00:59:00.550]
Inside radio stuff 84, religion only 47, well too bad, I like it.

[00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:05.550]
Because nobody, especially in America, has got the balls to talk about what crap it is.

[00:59:05.770 --> 00:59:08.810]
Western Europe, they're like, oh, people kidding or what?

[00:59:09.150 --> 00:59:10.070]
You really believe that garbage?

[00:59:10.830 --> 00:59:12.090]
I hate this poll 38.

[00:59:12.370 --> 00:59:13.090]
Hockey 29.

[00:59:13.590 --> 00:59:15.270]
Let's talk about those Ottawa Senators.

[00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:15.870]
I do not.

[00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:20.130]
That Daniel Alfredson, food and restaurants 26.

[00:59:20.130 --> 00:59:21.210]
How's Marty Havelat doing?

[00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:22.170]
See ever coming back.

[00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:23.250]
Gay stuff 21.

[00:59:23.830 --> 00:59:25.110]
Slots in gambling 12.

[00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:26.630]
Get that good machine ready, man.

[00:59:27.110 --> 00:59:29.510]
Let's be on a good machine before I finish with the poll result.

[00:59:30.910 --> 00:59:34.030]
So Jacob writes this column about this Rosio Donald thing which I wouldn't give her the time

[00:59:34.030 --> 00:59:34.990]
of day that fat cow.

[00:59:36.070 --> 00:59:39.690]
She's having one of these gay cruises to the Bahamas.

[00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:43.390]
See, I hate to write the news so they went down her and she stayed on the ship.

[00:59:43.530 --> 00:59:47.170]
Other people went out and took a lot of abuse from locals because they hate gay.

[00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:47.870]
They can't stand.

[00:59:48.090 --> 00:59:48.630]
They just obsessed.

[00:59:49.350 --> 00:59:49.770]
Yeah.

[00:59:51.410 --> 00:59:51.830]
Yeah.

[00:59:52.450 --> 00:59:53.650]
That's what they were screaming at.

[00:59:53.710 --> 00:59:56.170]
Everybody got off the accruciate when Rosio took him down her.

[00:59:56.730 --> 00:59:57.150]
Yeah.

[00:59:59.630 --> 01:00:02.070]
It's like rubbing their noses and they don't want you.

[01:00:02.170 --> 01:00:02.770]
They're okay bitch.

[01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:04.570]
They hate you.

[01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:06.270]
They can't stand in the Bahamas.

[01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:08.230]
It's just they're not their thing.

[01:00:09.250 --> 01:00:10.750]
Not that anybody would want them anyway.

[01:00:11.690 --> 01:00:12.450]
Religion 47.

[01:00:12.610 --> 01:00:13.370]
I hate this poll 30.

[01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:14.110]
At hockey 29.

[01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:15.150]
Food restaurants 26.

[01:00:15.150 --> 01:00:15.890]
Gay stuff 21.

[01:00:16.110 --> 01:00:16.830]
Slots gambling 12.

[01:00:16.830 --> 01:00:17.610]
Amcidium 6.

[01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:18.310]
Only 6.

[01:00:18.410 --> 01:00:19.130]
See how they've sourced out.

[01:00:19.170 --> 01:00:19.690]
I'm stood on.

[01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:21.710]
Health problem 6.

[01:00:22.010 --> 01:00:22.790]
Immigration 5.

[01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:23.830]
Not that you would not.

[01:00:23.830 --> 01:00:24.710]
We need to think it's South Florida.

[01:00:24.810 --> 01:00:25.510]
That would be really big.

[01:00:25.790 --> 01:00:26.830]
We did that poll the other day.

[01:00:26.970 --> 01:00:28.030]
No, I voted politics too.

[01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:28.650]
No.

[01:00:29.110 --> 01:00:30.090]
The track 5.

[01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:31.110]
We don't talk about the track.

[01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:32.570]
Except Pompeo Park when they run a spot.

[01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:34.430]
The stock market 3.

[01:00:34.570 --> 01:00:35.390]
Never talk about that.

[01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:36.790]
Don't invest any of your money in that crap.

[01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:38.750]
Remember and just think and run and run.

[01:00:39.370 --> 01:00:40.690]
Think WorldCom and run.

[01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:42.430]
Think.com.

[01:00:42.610 --> 01:00:42.830]
Think as.

[01:00:43.790 --> 01:00:44.450]
Gives.com.

[01:00:45.130 --> 01:00:45.970]
Jewish stuff too.

[01:00:45.970 --> 01:00:46.870]
And die talk too.

[01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:47.730]
How about Jewish diets?

[01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:50.670]
How about pacidicky candy?

[01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:53.090]
And by the way, happy paysock everybody.

[01:00:53.410 --> 01:00:54.010]
And happy Easter.

[01:00:54.310 --> 01:00:57.390]
Hope that your Easter eggs are really good ones.

[01:00:57.490 --> 01:00:58.890]
And filled with all kinds of good stuff.

[01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:01.650]
See, that's why a lot of people like these kind of...

[01:01:01.650 --> 01:01:02.250]
This kind of year.

[01:01:02.350 --> 01:01:04.870]
Because even at paysock you got pacidicky candy.

[01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:05.950]
And I think also chocolate.

[01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:06.590]
I don't know.

[01:01:06.670 --> 01:01:07.790]
I don't know anything about paysock.

[01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:09.210]
Other than this stale monster.

[01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:10.030]
It tastes like cardboard.

[01:01:10.590 --> 01:01:11.030]
And wine.

[01:01:11.410 --> 01:01:11.910]
A lot of wine.

[01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:13.610]
Boos it up pretty good.

[01:01:14.290 --> 01:01:16.950]
And then Hacid will go out there and throw stale monster answer.

[01:01:17.310 --> 01:01:18.430]
That's one thing about the Jew.

[01:01:18.590 --> 01:01:19.310]
Well, it's like everything.

[01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:20.970]
Same thing with the Echristians.

[01:01:21.050 --> 01:01:22.950]
The Protestants and Lutherans hate each other.

[01:01:23.090 --> 01:01:26.710]
Everybody hates the Catholics and they despise everybody who doesn't believe their crap, right?

[01:01:27.330 --> 01:01:27.450]
Right.

[01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:31.610]
The Methodists, the Presbyterians, the Southern Baptists.

[01:01:31.710 --> 01:01:32.730]
They all hate each other.

[01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:34.890]
The Bob Jones crowd.

[01:01:34.890 --> 01:01:35.930]
They're Southern Baptists, right?

[01:01:36.450 --> 01:01:36.590]
Yeah.

[01:01:36.790 --> 01:01:37.730]
Some kind of Baptists.

[01:01:37.830 --> 01:01:39.410]
Think the Catholics are all going to rot and hell.

[01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:42.110]
And it's just a love fest, man.

[01:01:42.110 --> 01:01:44.350]
It's all about God's love is what it is.

[01:01:45.350 --> 01:01:46.330]
God, you have it, man.

[01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:46.970]
You keep it.

[01:01:47.530 --> 01:01:50.070]
And don't forget tomorrow's Friday, macaroni and cheese.

[01:01:50.290 --> 01:01:50.930]
Get those elbows.

[01:01:51.210 --> 01:01:52.350]
Get those damn elbows.

[01:01:52.930 --> 01:01:54.950]
In fact, I'm sharing some cheese in my elbows right now.

[01:01:55.150 --> 01:01:56.230]
Maybe a little of my knee couldn't hurt.

[01:01:57.490 --> 01:01:59.130]
Now, I took like a little, not not big.

[01:01:59.290 --> 01:02:00.810]
You know, I want you to like emotional about it.

[01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:02.750]
But you're like a little chunk out of my kneecap there.

[01:02:03.590 --> 01:02:03.950]
Ooh.

[01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:04.650]
Did you eat it?

[01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:06.430]
Oh, God.

[01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:07.070]
It's missing.

[01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:07.950]
It's M-I-A.

[01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:09.050]
I said long gone.

[01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:10.590]
Now, this is like a little hole there.

[01:02:11.170 --> 01:02:13.270]
I got a, I'm going to probably fit some with a show.

[01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:14.070]
I got a holy knee.

[01:02:17.250 --> 01:02:17.990]
It's wrong with that.

[01:02:18.090 --> 01:02:18.730]
Maybe with a breast.

[01:02:19.050 --> 01:02:21.350]
Maybe the, maybe the, maybe the priest kissed it.

[01:02:21.850 --> 01:02:23.870]
You know, it's how they always like about to put something in your mouth.

[01:02:24.030 --> 01:02:25.070]
I was just reading that thing before.

[01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:28.790]
And of course, if it's not bad, it's the little wine and the wafer in the mouth.

[01:02:28.790 --> 01:02:28.930]
Right.

[01:02:29.550 --> 01:02:30.810]
Get on your knees and open your mouth.

[01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:31.490]
Stick your tongue in.

[01:02:31.530 --> 01:02:32.130]
Yeah, there you go.

[01:02:32.310 --> 01:02:33.110]
I got some for you.

[01:02:33.210 --> 01:02:34.450]
Yeah, I got something good for you.

[01:02:34.730 --> 01:02:35.170]
Very cool.

[01:02:35.690 --> 01:02:36.170]
Close your eyes.

[01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:37.590]
1113 at 560 WQI.

[01:02:38.370 --> 01:02:40.570]
And being outdoors a lot in South Florida, you better get some reading.

[01:02:40.570 --> 01:02:42.850]
Be comfortable shoes because you do a lot of waltz and around.

[01:02:43.370 --> 01:02:48.730]
So the only place to go with them, to see these brandy shoes and pompano beads, they carry all the top brands in the shoe vines.

[01:02:49.590 --> 01:02:55.910]
Floreshine, Echo, Mephisto, Rockport, Hushpuppey, New Balance, tons of other name brands and all sizes for man of women.

[01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:59.270]
I really need all sizes, even wide wits and hard to find sizes too.

[01:02:59.570 --> 01:03:03.390]
They're right there on the shelf right in the slap on your feet when you do your shoe shopping at Brandy's.

[01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:05.750]
They're the largest independent shoe retailer in all South Florida.

[01:03:06.110 --> 01:03:10.550]
And when you see the selection value you get at Brandy's, you'll understand why rave about them all the time and have been in the shoe vines.

[01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:16.970]
Talk to our friend Arnie at Brandy, so make sure he gets the right penny shoes for your feet because a perfect fit is what it's all about.

[01:03:17.470 --> 01:03:20.390]
Brandy's isn't like those department stores where it takes for everybody to get weighted on.

[01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:24.350]
And then when you pick out a style they say, oh you've got to be kidding, we don't have that in your size.

[01:03:24.570 --> 01:03:26.570]
The only thing they do do with Brandy is they choose.

[01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:33.550]
So you never have to worry about size selection service and certainly not about price because when it comes to price, Brandy's is unbeatable.

[01:03:33.550 --> 01:03:38.390]
You find Brandy's at 1290 North Federal Highway and Propero Beach between Atlantic and Copen's roads on the east side.

[01:03:38.730 --> 01:03:43.550]
You can't miss it. Brandy's open every day of the week Monday through Saturday till 9, every Sunday till 5.

[01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:46.770]
And this week is a super time to buy S.A. shoes at Brandy's.

[01:03:46.930 --> 01:03:49.570]
Be sure and tell by the way that Brian Schmutz sent you when you go to Brandy's.

[01:03:49.590 --> 01:03:54.810]
Brian Schmutz, say 20 to 40 bucks a pair on all great men's and women's S.A.S. dials this week.

[01:03:55.050 --> 01:04:00.370]
So be sure to get your ass into Brandy's this week and save a lot of cash or do your shoe shopping right there on your fat ass.

[01:04:00.370 --> 01:04:03.230]
Just go online at Brandy's shoes dot com.

[01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:05.390]
This is Neil Rogers.

[01:04:06.170 --> 01:04:08.210]
This is 516.

[01:04:13.890 --> 01:04:17.030]
Fort Greer radio is like a huge war.

[01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:22.570]
I'm not a price.

[01:04:22.830 --> 01:04:23.730]
Chris is gay.

[01:04:24.010 --> 01:04:24.830]
He's a good angel.

[01:04:24.830 --> 01:04:26.230]
You can get it.

[01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:27.670]
No. Charlie.

[01:04:27.890 --> 01:04:28.530]
Is he related?

[01:04:28.890 --> 01:04:29.550]
Ask his brother.

[01:04:29.790 --> 01:04:30.310]
Good brother.

[01:04:30.490 --> 01:04:30.590]
Hey.

[01:04:31.050 --> 01:04:33.770]
I know it's hard to say he's a gay Republican.

[01:04:34.410 --> 01:04:36.590]
He knows his name is a gay Christian.

[01:04:36.810 --> 01:04:37.450]
That's Charlie.

[01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:38.610]
Chris is not gay.

[01:04:38.930 --> 01:04:39.950]
Not finish it, cooling.

[01:04:40.490 --> 01:04:41.050]
That's gay.

[01:04:41.830 --> 01:04:42.310]
That's gay.

[01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:43.750]
He's running for governor.

[01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:45.050]
Governor of law.

[01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:46.970]
Whoever chops clothes.

[01:04:47.290 --> 01:04:47.610]
No, no.

[01:04:47.830 --> 01:04:48.350]
He left.

[01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:50.490]
Jesus, Charlie Christ, we're governor.

[01:04:50.490 --> 01:04:53.570]
This message paid for by Christians with secret Republican thoughts.

[01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:53.890]
I'll pay.

[01:04:54.830 --> 01:04:55.630]
Oh no.

[01:04:56.050 --> 01:04:56.690]
It's 1118.

[01:04:56.830 --> 01:04:57.270]
Charlie.

[01:04:57.410 --> 01:04:57.750]
You're free.

[01:04:58.050 --> 01:04:59.630]
1118 at 560 WQ.

[01:04:59.630 --> 01:05:00.710]
I'm happy Thursday to you.

[01:05:01.450 --> 01:05:04.110]
Now, you know, it's good intentions here, represent this facts.

[01:05:04.490 --> 01:05:06.170]
How many articles have I read about this?

[01:05:06.310 --> 01:05:08.550]
I mean, this is this is ancient history.

[01:05:09.070 --> 01:05:11.370]
This is more ancient than the stuff about the Romans.

[01:05:11.370 --> 01:05:13.310]
I just got you a ranting on.

[01:05:14.170 --> 01:05:16.170]
And it says, bush-bashing exclamation.

[01:05:16.290 --> 01:05:17.270]
Like, this is going to please me.

[01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:18.570]
And with all the respect,

[01:05:21.210 --> 01:05:21.590]
I'm going to say,

[01:05:21.810 --> 01:05:24.150]
the Bush administration has made it hard for them to speak for it rightly,

[01:05:24.310 --> 01:05:25.530]
the public about global warming.

[01:05:25.930 --> 01:05:28.670]
The result researcher say is a danger that Americans are getting to full story

[01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:29.570]
and how the climate has changed.

[01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:33.110]
How many stories have I read on the year and how many on our website in the last two weeks?

[01:05:33.150 --> 01:05:34.150]
About 30 minutes.

[01:05:34.530 --> 01:05:35.230]
About that, right?

[01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:35.810]
Right.

[01:05:36.290 --> 01:05:37.030]
Good God.

[01:05:37.210 --> 01:05:38.450]
An ideology of from, right.

[01:05:39.110 --> 01:05:41.650]
That right-wing, yoskee ideology.

[01:05:42.050 --> 01:05:43.330]
I'd ideology, excuse me.

[01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:50.770]
555 and we're almost to 666. It's the Antichrist show. I think I can play that one voice

[01:05:50.770 --> 01:05:56.310]
no more. Yeah, the Antichrist. Hello, no. I want to ask you a question. My son was watching

[01:05:56.310 --> 01:06:06.670]
your program on the, on the Wami on Miami. The date was 15 and I would like to know if

[01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:13.310]
you're some kind of Antichrist version because now my son wants to worship the devil because

[01:06:13.310 --> 01:06:20.530]
he thinks it's cool and he also wants to just as ladies and solicit on now. I don't know

[01:06:20.530 --> 01:06:27.470]
if the whole channel 59 is the Antichrist channel. I'm really concerned and I would like to know

[01:06:27.470 --> 01:06:34.970]
if you're the Antichrist. Thank you and please if I see you somewhere I wouldn't need something to

[01:06:34.970 --> 01:06:41.930]
be water because now you turn my son into a baguette and you made my son the Antichrist. Thank you.

[01:06:43.210 --> 01:06:47.990]
And have a nice day. You're making it for it. Yes, I am. Yeah, and have a nice day too, sweetheart.

[01:06:48.830 --> 01:06:56.330]
She's a real a rocket scientist. A scientist. A real smart lady. I did say I had some stuff. Yeah,

[01:06:56.410 --> 01:07:04.950]
I'll I'll enter spurs. I want to take thousands of calls that I'm just in the mood for that. I don't

[01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:10.550]
want to put another one during a breakup and another piece of paper towel on her. I'm

[01:07:10.550 --> 01:07:16.290]
wasting it and I stuck it on her and it's got a little red spot. I'd like that cheer we used to have

[01:07:16.290 --> 01:07:22.910]
it. I.O.D. Wal-Mart has turned aside a massive letter writing campaign by the American Family

[01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:27.290]
Association urging the retailer to refuse to stock growth back mountain being distributed by

[01:07:27.290 --> 01:07:31.230]
universal home entertainment. The group which has successfully campaigned against what it

[01:07:31.230 --> 01:07:36.630]
can seem to be broadcast in decency. Oh, yeah, the American Family Association launched the

[01:07:36.630 --> 01:07:40.690]
campaign last week after ads for the film began being displayed prominently in the retailer's

[01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:47.570]
3,900 stores. In interview with today's LA Times yesterday the AFA's Randy Sharapakuse

[01:07:47.570 --> 01:07:52.350]
Walmart at helping to push the gay agenda by trying to normalize homosexuality in society. He

[01:07:52.350 --> 01:07:56.150]
added but how many copies that are going to have to sell to recoup the losses of customers who

[01:07:56.150 --> 01:08:01.030]
they've offended will no longer shop at Walmart. But a Walmart spokeswoman replied the fact that

[01:08:01.030 --> 01:08:04.210]
we're offering the movies not endorsement of the content of the movie or any specific belief.

[01:08:04.470 --> 01:08:11.790]
We simply offer the latest titles that consumers want. How do you like that? All right.

[01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:17.450]
Well, that's your buddy to Walmart because I'm glad that the go-am are going after them. Excellent.

[01:08:18.810 --> 01:08:24.310]
Maybe they're going to like boycott your ass. You morons, you fools. And speaking of fools,

[01:08:24.590 --> 01:08:27.350]
you know, see this is the thing that really cracks me up. Now Elliott Spitzer, the next

[01:08:27.350 --> 01:08:32.150]
governor in New York and the next president of the US, Elliott Spitzer has gone after a

[01:08:32.150 --> 01:08:36.350]
cheap channel and these other pay-ola people and the FCC of course, he's really pissed off of them

[01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:41.630]
because what they've done is the FCC like every other government agency, all they want is your money.

[01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:44.650]
In other words, if you pay them a certain amount of money they'll just go away and they'll

[01:08:44.650 --> 01:08:49.510]
have how many laws you broke. So clear channel, you know, they're used to it. They have a lot of

[01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:53.070]
experience because when it came to all their indecent seat complaints they just came up with a number

[01:08:53.070 --> 01:08:57.070]
of them in infinity and oh, here, how's this sound? We'll give you like eight million. Oh, okay.

[01:08:57.690 --> 01:09:01.990]
And then they just drop everything. So it has nothing to do with really being concerned about

[01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:06.410]
the public or protecting the public airwaves and this crap. It's just how much money can they hold

[01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:12.490]
you up for? That's what it's all about. Am I right? Absolutely. Right. And the latest example,

[01:09:12.670 --> 01:09:16.910]
clear channels offered to pay a million dollars as a settlement with the FCC over their ongoing

[01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:21.090]
pay-ola probe according to San Antonio Express News. Oh, San Antonio, the New Home of New Marlins.

[01:09:22.090 --> 01:09:26.390]
Clear channels Chief Legal Officer Andrew Levin told the paper that the Radio Ownership

[01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:30.610]
John is in talks with the FCC stating we're willing to pay a reasonable amount to put this matter

[01:09:30.610 --> 01:09:35.350]
behind us. A reasonable amount. I think the business would do that too. Eight bucks. Yeah, that's

[01:09:35.350 --> 01:09:40.010]
all I got. We want to go back to focusing on our business and not on ancient history,

[01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:43.930]
said Mr. Levin or Levin or whatever his name is. Levin told the newspaper that

[01:09:43.930 --> 01:09:48.710]
Clear channel is fully cooperated with both the FCC and Elliot Spitzer and both pay-ola probes

[01:09:48.710 --> 01:09:52.630]
turning over thousands of documents to investigators. He said just because we're the largest radio

[01:09:52.630 --> 01:09:57.070]
company doesn't mean we have the largest violations. Yeah, you do your crux. We have been a model

[01:09:57.070 --> 01:10:01.130]
for the industry in terms of trying to put a staff to this practice. Right. Over the weekend,

[01:10:01.150 --> 01:10:05.370]
it was reported that Clear channel CBS Radio Citadel Intercom were sent to soon settle with

[01:10:05.370 --> 01:10:09.930]
the federal government over pay-ola allegations and then on Monday, Spitzer spoke on an interview

[01:10:09.930 --> 01:10:14.750]
criticizing the FCC for making their own deals with Radio Ownership groups while his criminal case

[01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:21.450]
is still ongoing. See what he said? I'll send it. A leader has announced agreement on immigration

[01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:25.050]
before him. But wanted to go to his business. Here's Bill's piss. It really make a very important

[01:10:25.050 --> 01:10:32.450]
announcement and that is the American people are well aware of the challenge that we have today

[01:10:32.450 --> 01:10:37.130]
in terms of having an immigration system that is flat out. Having a bunch of quirks like you

[01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:43.490]
and the Senators, yeah, here, here, here, at the level of the place of the work site and also

[01:10:44.290 --> 01:10:47.190]
by the way, he didn't know he had that stock just keep on running.

[01:10:47.650 --> 01:10:53.790]
And I told her a last year I set out a two-week plan that is being fulfilled

[01:10:53.790 --> 01:10:56.610]
with the deal we have. Talk about Honduras. Where we would start with a strong border

[01:10:56.610 --> 01:11:01.310]
schedule. I'm gonna chase okay. Yahoo. Y'all ready? Get to it.

[01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:04.730]
Under our inspectors, Senator Spector, Senator, Senator,

[01:11:04.890 --> 01:11:09.710]
Senator, Senator, we build that out with a more comprehensive bill motion spectrum,

[01:11:10.110 --> 01:11:14.570]
enforcement, interior enforcement and a temporary workup program that does address

[01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:21.790]
12 million people who in this country are undocumented. The good news is that because of the hard work

[01:11:21.790 --> 01:11:27.390]
of the people who are with me, we've had a huge breakthrough which will allow us to

[01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:32.910]
be able to do that in the next several hours that will lead us to the conclusion of passing a very

[01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:38.730]
important bill. I'm gonna turn to my colleagues, I guess, initially Senator Spector. And then

[01:11:39.490 --> 01:11:45.710]
I'll turn to the spectator, Senator, to candidate to reflect why this alternative that has come

[01:11:45.710 --> 01:11:50.310]
forward is all about in the implications for the country. It can only be really bad news

[01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:54.650]
for the 250 freedom media. And there's a little red background there, the ruling pepperoni

[01:11:54.650 --> 01:11:56.870]
juice down is a South Carolina chimer over there.

[01:12:05.150 --> 01:12:08.270]
I don't know who would have to say anything more Senator Reid is here.

[01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:16.530]
Senator Frist has accurately characterized the situation as a breakthrough.

[01:12:17.850 --> 01:12:20.810]
And Reid please. Yeah, they found the bullet on the stretcher by the way.

[01:12:20.810 --> 01:12:23.870]
The leaders of the senators who are here today.

[01:12:24.230 --> 01:12:26.630]
They're still twisting and turning.

[01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:32.850]
Republicans and Democrats and the leaders and the ranking member of Judicial.

[01:12:32.910 --> 01:12:38.310]
Let me know when he says something. We have worked through a great many problems

[01:12:39.290 --> 01:12:44.630]
starting with the McCain-Tenidad and Kyle Cornyn and the Hegel legislation.

[01:12:45.390 --> 01:12:49.690]
And I think we produced a good bill, not a perfect bill.

[01:12:50.670 --> 01:12:53.650]
Regrettably we haven't been able to have amendments all for two.

[01:12:54.550 --> 01:12:57.690]
So we needed some modification.

[01:12:57.970 --> 01:12:59.550]
Oh, this is more than I can handle you.

[01:12:59.630 --> 01:13:01.190]
Wonder why people are interested in politics?

[01:13:01.770 --> 01:13:04.890]
Just ponders. But I mean, it looked like you'll bell for Christ's.

[01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:06.210]
But I mean, but we're all over the place.

[01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:08.470]
Just say something. Just went and out spit it out.

[01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:10.810]
More than five years old.

[01:13:10.810 --> 01:13:13.810]
You sold tored you. You silly-ass person with your magic bullet theory.

[01:13:13.930 --> 01:13:14.570]
Oh god.

[01:13:15.650 --> 01:13:18.830]
See, if we just went a threatened to record a bunch of magic bullets like that,

[01:13:18.930 --> 01:13:22.770]
that hit one of them and then twisted and turned and then started hitting a bunch of other people.

[01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:24.010]
Oh, but they can be like the magic.

[01:13:24.230 --> 01:13:25.310]
Then they will fear us.

[01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:25.850]
Okay.

[01:13:27.250 --> 01:13:28.410]
Then they will fear us.

[01:13:28.710 --> 01:13:29.870]
Although maybe they ought to fear you.

[01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:32.510]
584 votes. What a shame, Eric.

[01:13:32.610 --> 01:13:34.130]
Boy, you really stuck it to us, man.

[01:13:34.490 --> 01:13:35.870]
You screwed us great time today.

[01:13:36.530 --> 01:13:37.610]
Did he call on a politicizer?

[01:13:37.650 --> 01:13:38.930]
Did he send you a message in the chat room?

[01:13:39.230 --> 01:13:39.410]
No.

[01:13:40.010 --> 01:13:42.770]
Sam just crashed fallen.

[01:13:43.130 --> 01:13:43.210]
No.

[01:13:43.570 --> 01:13:44.870]
Because I screwed up so bad.

[01:13:44.990 --> 01:13:46.210]
And he kept faxing me that for all.

[01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:48.330]
Because I knew he wasn't paying any attention to it.

[01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:49.950]
And so I kept faxing it.

[01:13:50.030 --> 01:13:52.310]
And faxing it probably at least three times.

[01:13:52.570 --> 01:13:54.090]
Yeah, I think of Norellic 300 times.

[01:13:54.850 --> 01:13:57.190]
And then finally, when you called up and bitched him out.

[01:13:57.930 --> 01:13:59.610]
And threatened to release those naked pictures.

[01:13:59.610 --> 01:14:01.070]
And finally, he said, okay.

[01:14:01.530 --> 01:14:05.790]
And then I came back in here from the tea room and there it was, like magic.

[01:14:06.930 --> 01:14:09.270]
27 past 11 and 560 WN.

[01:14:09.370 --> 01:14:10.890]
We got the Geldy again today.

[01:14:11.090 --> 01:14:11.850]
Oh my god.

[01:14:11.950 --> 01:14:12.690]
Too much Geldy.

[01:14:13.090 --> 01:14:14.010]
Too much Geldy.

[01:14:14.490 --> 01:14:15.610]
Panthers have done, okay.

[01:14:15.970 --> 01:14:16.750]
I'm gonna get with it.

[01:14:17.390 --> 01:14:18.570]
Somebody go out in the hallway and yell,

[01:14:18.650 --> 01:14:19.990]
the Panthers have done their toast.

[01:14:21.690 --> 01:14:24.150]
So we got Geldy on there to give us a song and an answer to.

[01:14:24.270 --> 01:14:26.290]
Mad Dog at the Masha is now gusted for.

[01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:28.970]
And then Hurley Kane hotline is seven.

[01:14:29.090 --> 01:14:29.730]

[01:14:29.810 --> 01:14:31.590]
Davidson's got two hours tonight, eight to ten.

[01:14:32.190 --> 01:14:34.030]
And as opposed, what are the old schedules, say,

[01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:34.870]
I already schmitt candid.

[01:14:35.170 --> 01:14:36.790]
No, I don't think they're going to reach for it.

[01:14:36.970 --> 01:14:37.510]
No, I got it.

[01:14:38.050 --> 01:14:40.210]
I was opposed to Jesse Agra who's been suspended for

[01:14:40.210 --> 01:14:41.430]
Pasquim Rondon our studio.

[01:14:42.370 --> 01:14:44.130]
And then 80 K and Vegas 10 o'clock tonight.

[01:14:44.490 --> 01:14:45.230]
Hasn't he been suspended?

[01:14:46.670 --> 01:14:47.950]
Although Josh likes him a lot.

[01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:48.730]
I said he's okay.

[01:14:49.890 --> 01:14:51.510]
I said he never turns him down.

[01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:53.850]
If you think you have termites in you,

[01:14:53.930 --> 01:14:56.910]

for just a few days.

[01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:28.470]

One more time for the West Coast.

[01:15:54.690 --> 01:15:56.350]
And believe me, they got some real pest over there.

[01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:59.850]
1-800-447-4348.

[01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:00.590]

[01:16:30.590 --> 01:16:35.610]
Her hair is a riddle and a teeth are rotten.

[01:16:36.770 --> 01:16:41.270]
But when these still keep searing lots of drugs,

[01:16:42.710 --> 01:16:47.870]
when she's actually thinks that she's covered with bugs,

[01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:53.810]
they invite a whore, hats, pictures of all the Whitney

[01:16:53.810 --> 01:16:58.990]
drug paraphernalia, needles and spoons.

[01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:01.930]
Mustroons.

[01:17:02.070 --> 01:17:07.950]
Whitney turns her mask in into a crackdown.

[01:17:09.010 --> 01:17:15.670]
It won't be long till she's rolled off to rehab again.

[01:17:18.630 --> 01:17:23.530]
Because there's cracks all to come and out her nose.

[01:17:25.330 --> 01:17:30.210]
Whitney's got an ape all in her family host.

[01:17:30.710 --> 01:17:35.090]
Her big bopby proud was Whitney just

[01:17:35.090 --> 01:17:37.970]
dark work in a hurt so hygiene.

[01:17:39.050 --> 01:17:41.410]
Because she's not clean.

[01:17:42.930 --> 01:17:47.330]
And the smell is of sea.

[01:17:52.730 --> 01:17:53.690]
That's something heavy.

[01:17:53.790 --> 01:17:55.210]
It's not the effects machine.

[01:17:57.290 --> 01:17:59.990]
And there's that Kennedy going and talking about immigrants.

[01:18:02.290 --> 01:18:04.770]
The problem is they keep making this mistake.

[01:18:05.070 --> 01:18:06.710]
They keep referring to these people who are likely to

[01:18:07.530 --> 01:18:08.590]
record this issue.

[01:18:08.810 --> 01:18:09.790]
So they're not immigrants.

[01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:10.730]
They're illegal aliens.

[01:18:11.550 --> 01:18:12.670]
They're illegal aliens.

[01:18:18.030 --> 01:18:21.870]
He can't make this mistake.

[01:18:21.870 --> 01:18:22.190]
So

[01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:23.090]
divine penitents.

[01:18:23.090 --> 01:18:23.550]
I wouldn't have done this in reality,

[01:18:23.550 --> 01:18:30.030]
if criticized, said the날ow to guard Burgundy.

[01:18:39.770 --> 01:18:40.230]
Things have gone passing,

[01:18:40.230 --> 01:18:41.670]
what do you think's all about holiday and лич movement?

[01:18:41.670 --> 01:18:44.290]
In fact, I think now it's an appropriate time to play.

[01:18:46.650 --> 01:18:50.150]
A former White House aid under indictment from Structe Lee Probe,

[01:18:50.290 --> 01:18:54.130]
Iowa's Scooter Libby testified to a grand jury that gave information

[01:18:54.130 --> 01:18:56.950]
from a closely guarded National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq

[01:18:56.950 --> 01:19:01.750]
to an New York Times reporter in 2003 with a specific permission of President Bush,

[01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:05.450]
according to a new court filing from the special prosecutor in the case.

[01:19:05.830 --> 01:19:09.450]
Let me read that last part again with a specific permission of President Bush.

[01:19:10.510 --> 01:19:13.430]
The court papers from the prosecutor's contract fit zero did not suggest

[01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:17.350]
that Mr. Bush violated any law or rule. However, the new disclosure could be awkward for the

[01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:21.350]
president because it places him for the first time directly in a chain of events that led to a

[01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:25.930]
meeting where prosecutors contend the identity of a CIA employee, Valerie Plain was provided to a

[01:19:25.930 --> 01:19:30.790]
reporter. Mr. Fitzgerald's inquiry initially focused on the alleged leak, which occurred

[01:19:30.790 --> 01:19:34.390]
after a former ambassador who had missed his claims, husband Joseph Wilson wrote the op-ed

[01:19:34.390 --> 01:19:37.710]
piece in the New York Times, questioning the accuracy of statements Mr. Bush made about a

[01:19:37.710 --> 01:19:42.490]
nuclear procurement efforts in Africa. No criminal charges have been brought for leak itself,

[01:19:42.690 --> 01:19:45.990]
but Mr. Libby was undoubtedly an October in charge of the obstructive investigation,

[01:19:46.450 --> 01:19:50.090]
perjured himself in front of the grand jury and lied FBI agents who interviewed him.

[01:19:51.490 --> 01:19:54.950]
In court filing, Lee, yesterday responded to requests for Mr. Libby's attorneys for

[01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:59.650]
government records at my date as defense. Mr. Fitzgerald said new light on Mr. Libby's claims that

[01:19:59.650 --> 01:20:03.570]
he was authorized to provide sensitive information at the time of the reporter Judith Miller

[01:20:03.570 --> 01:20:09.550]
at a meeting on July 8, 2003. Defended testify that he was specifically authorized and

[01:20:09.550 --> 01:20:13.630]
advanced in the meeting to disclose the key judgments of the classified NIE to Miller on that

[01:20:13.630 --> 01:20:17.770]
occasion because it was thought that the NIE was pretty definitive against what Ambassador Joe

[01:20:17.770 --> 01:20:21.410]
Wilson had said and that the vice president thought it was very important for the key judgments

[01:20:21.410 --> 01:20:25.930]
of the NIE to come out. Mr. Libby has said to have testified that at first he

[01:20:25.930 --> 01:20:30.050]
rebuffed Mr. Cheney's suggestion to release the information because the estimate was classified.

[01:20:30.050 --> 01:20:34.950]
However, according to the vice presidential aide Mr. Cheney subsequently said he got permission

[01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:40.350]
for the release directly from Mr. Bush. Defended testify that the vice president later advised

[01:20:40.350 --> 01:20:44.250]
him the president of the authorized dependent to disclose the relevant portions of the NIE

[01:20:44.250 --> 01:20:49.590]
in prosecution filing said. Mr. Libby told the grand jury he also sought the advice of legal counsel

[01:20:49.590 --> 01:20:53.770]
to the vice president David Addington who indicated that Mr. Bush's permission to disclose the

[01:20:53.770 --> 01:20:57.030]
estimate amounted to a declassification of the document according to the new court papers.

[01:20:57.030 --> 01:21:00.150]
Put them all in jail. That's what I say including that phony John McCain.

[01:21:00.150 --> 01:21:05.190]
So this compromise? Yeah, compromise. Yes, you phony baloney. Man, you talk about air zots.

[01:21:05.490 --> 01:21:09.310]
You talk about something or someone who is not even close to a being with what they would like

[01:21:09.310 --> 01:21:11.690]
you to think that they are. There he is. Sure, they comprehend.

[01:21:12.090 --> 01:21:14.630]
See, and that's why God puffed up his teeth like that. You don't know that, don't you?

[01:21:15.210 --> 01:21:19.190]
I do know. Remember what God did to Jerry Lewis? Oh, yeah. You better watch it.

[01:21:21.250 --> 01:21:25.370]
606 votes on the pool. What makes me really, it just makes me a week at the knee.

[01:21:25.370 --> 01:21:27.010]
Maybe that's the blood. I don't know.

[01:21:29.770 --> 01:21:32.050]
Because we could have really, we could have been a contender today.

[01:21:32.750 --> 01:21:36.310]
We could have kicked some serious big fat smelly bloody hairy ass.

[01:21:37.010 --> 01:21:40.250]
Do you think? Yeah, whatever. I know Josh is pretty bummed out about it.

[01:21:40.430 --> 01:21:43.230]
He's pretty bummed out that Joe came in and talked to you and didn't talk to him.

[01:21:43.550 --> 01:21:46.590]
Didn't he pay you out of back and say, hey, you're next man. We'll take care of you.

[01:21:46.750 --> 01:21:49.990]
Yeah, that's what he did. Didn't do nothing. I didn't even come anywhere near you.

[01:21:51.030 --> 01:21:53.210]
Didn't he? He said hi.

[01:21:53.710 --> 01:21:57.450]
Yeah, and that was it. Pretty much. You give him the high sign?

[01:21:59.010 --> 01:22:03.450]
The higher palli sign. Yeah, the high sign.

[01:22:05.850 --> 01:22:09.210]
614 votes. See, this is what happens when you've got a place run by glam.

[01:22:10.050 --> 01:22:13.670]
Of all the things that Neil talks about, which is the most interesting to you, politics,

[01:22:13.970 --> 01:22:17.110]
276, nothing even close. Just rip those Nazis and ass.

[01:22:18.110 --> 01:22:22.570]
Inside radio stuff, 92, and you mark my words when we get back into radio, we'll let you know.

[01:22:23.210 --> 01:22:25.150]
Then we'll really start leaning on it.

[01:22:25.850 --> 01:22:28.010]
Religion only 62. They don't want to hear that religious crap.

[01:22:28.690 --> 01:22:31.170]
I hate this poll 42. Hockey's got.

[01:22:31.490 --> 01:22:33.990]
Bats are in me. I had a hair stop with an nonsense.

[01:22:34.830 --> 01:22:38.590]
Food and restaurants 29, gay stuff 23, Jewish stuff 17.

[01:22:39.070 --> 01:22:41.050]
What about Jewish gay stuff like Harvey Firestein?

[01:22:42.030 --> 01:22:46.250]
Yeah, something just on to me. I was taken leaked before or maybe I was getting that bandaid.

[01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:50.090]
I was in the tea room. Yeah, and just on to me that

[01:22:51.230 --> 01:22:54.190]
Joe Bell is kind of like a goesia Harvey Firestein.

[01:22:54.630 --> 01:22:56.890]
I just want to be loved. Is that so bad?

[01:22:57.730 --> 01:23:00.370]
So wrong. Is it so wrong? Whatever. Whatever you say.

[01:23:00.550 --> 01:23:03.530]
So you're the expert. I never saw that movie. I can't stand Harvey Firestein.

[01:23:03.910 --> 01:23:05.770]
Neither. I was not in gambling 12.

[01:23:06.110 --> 01:23:09.550]
Health problem 7. Immigration 6. Amsterdam 6. Amsterdam.

[01:23:10.050 --> 01:23:15.910]
The track 6. Diet talk 3 in the stock market 3. So the ones at the bottom there last the 4.

[01:23:16.390 --> 01:23:21.870]
5. No health problems. They don't care about health. They all have a death wish like Hank.

[01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:27.830]
Immigration. Amsterdam. No more that the track. Forget about that except the spots when they pay.

[01:23:28.150 --> 01:23:31.150]
Diet talk. No moss. And the stock market.

[01:23:32.630 --> 01:23:35.090]
You got those mark mark. There was four or five now. Got it.

[01:23:35.430 --> 01:23:38.510]
And if I ever start, you know, in fact, just just said no. What's his name?

[01:23:38.610 --> 01:23:41.510]
Jesse Agriwin had to place some spots in the control while I'm talking about it.

[01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:44.230]
To kind of like distract the audience.

[01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:59.530]
People's staff infractions. It's none other than Josh Bolton who collects pictures of presidential

[01:23:59.530 --> 01:24:01.110]
hands. You mean John Balton?

[01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:04.830]
Josh Bolton. That guy who has a fetish with presidential hands.

[01:24:04.990 --> 01:24:07.230]
I don't want him. No, not Michael Bolton.

[01:24:07.230 --> 01:24:12.110]
Josh Bolton. Presidential hand picture collector is here to sing about his collection of

[01:24:12.110 --> 01:24:13.490]
presidential hands for you.

[01:24:37.230 --> 01:24:40.930]
Josh Bolton's I Love Hands includes all time favorites like Chica Hat.

[01:24:41.370 --> 01:24:42.890]
Don't kick him. No, hand me down hand.

[01:24:43.170 --> 01:24:47.090]
Cherry Board has a slow hand and I want a picture of your hand.

[01:24:47.350 --> 01:25:01.990]
Oh yeah. I have lots of pictures of presidential hands and I collect pictures of presidential hands.

[01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:03.870]
Let's cross my office.

[01:25:04.510 --> 01:25:08.970]
On this open bread with your Joe Guy.

[01:25:09.570 --> 01:25:11.990]
On this.

[01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:13.930]
Let's cross my office.

[01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:16.890]
On this and my hands.

[01:25:17.270 --> 01:25:18.530]
On my five.

[01:25:19.550 --> 01:25:22.790]
Get John Bolton's I Love Hands today and give a hand.

[01:25:24.190 --> 01:25:27.650]
Or just give him a finger. It's 1143 17-colonacum.

[01:25:27.650 --> 01:25:33.450]
We got Gully at two, mad dog from the masters at four, and then we got the stuff, hurricane stuff.

[01:25:34.710 --> 01:25:35.910]
How many QAM? Hello?

[01:25:38.390 --> 01:25:38.770]
QAM?

[01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:45.330]
And then nice sound. It is clean, quiet.

[01:25:46.690 --> 01:25:50.130]
566-10560, 05-60, and if you're right, then see you at a wireless line.

[01:25:50.210 --> 01:25:52.810]
Just ready for a real big Fourier call there, and of course, there aren't any.

[01:25:53.630 --> 01:25:57.930]
What is these are really the signs of the times, man, in this place?

[01:25:58.890 --> 01:26:00.870]
The signs of the times, not good.

[01:26:02.030 --> 01:26:04.870]
Speaking of the signs of the times, Gully and handing them to three bucks or more.

[01:26:05.210 --> 01:26:07.790]
Oh, boy. Yeah, you better get that 58 bucks back.

[01:26:09.210 --> 01:26:10.390]
What are you laughing about?

[01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:15.170]
If I was you, I'd go into counting right now, and I would count on somebody who's pissed back there,

[01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:19.290]
and say, look, you bastards cost me 58 bucks yesterday because I didn't get paid on payday.

[01:26:19.510 --> 01:26:20.290]
You know, I'm money in there.

[01:26:20.290 --> 01:26:22.510]
And I'm not going to pay the 58 bucks out of my pocket.

[01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:23.930]
I'm just some kind of a schlepper, okay?

[01:26:24.230 --> 01:26:27.510]
I got a wife and two kids that are a dog to support, and the payments to make,

[01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:29.410]
and you're screwing up my life. That's what I would do.

[01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:33.150]
And then of course, as you walked away, you did them all chuckling.

[01:26:33.290 --> 01:26:33.650]
That's right.

[01:26:34.750 --> 01:26:35.350]
Like that.

[01:26:36.850 --> 01:26:37.930]
Shouting behind your back.

[01:26:40.010 --> 01:26:40.690]
WQAM, hello?

[01:26:42.410 --> 01:26:43.550]
I've got a great show.

[01:26:44.150 --> 01:26:44.270]
Yeah.

[01:26:45.730 --> 01:26:46.050]
Yeah.

[01:26:46.050 --> 01:26:47.170]
Fanta white is 48.

[01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:48.030]
No.

[01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:49.770]
Check it out.

[01:26:50.070 --> 01:26:50.390]
I did.

[01:26:50.470 --> 01:26:51.010]
Check it out.

[01:26:51.050 --> 01:26:52.450]
He's 59 and she's 57.

[01:26:52.450 --> 01:26:53.290]
I checked it out online.

[01:26:53.330 --> 01:26:53.790]
I googled it.

[01:26:54.950 --> 01:26:55.650]
Check it again.

[01:26:56.330 --> 01:26:57.290]
You know, check this.

[01:26:58.810 --> 01:27:00.050]
Fanta white is 48.

[01:27:00.250 --> 01:27:00.730]
My ass.

[01:27:01.110 --> 01:27:01.950]
Just look at those feet.

[01:27:02.170 --> 01:27:02.310]
Shit.

[01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:04.570]
In fact, if you were to say 98 that I bought that sooner,

[01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:06.230]
well, why would I want to check it again?

[01:27:06.350 --> 01:27:06.930]
Did I make it up?

[01:27:06.970 --> 01:27:10.010]
Don't you remember the day we had to check it again?

[01:27:10.390 --> 01:27:11.250]
Like you'd check it anyway.

[01:27:11.790 --> 01:27:13.090]
There must be check-its.

[01:27:13.690 --> 01:27:14.670]
Maybe it's Chubby Checker.

[01:27:15.050 --> 01:27:16.150]
Somebody QAM, hello?

[01:27:16.230 --> 01:27:18.470]
Somebody QAM, hello?

[01:27:19.090 --> 01:27:20.130]
Hey, Neil, how are you?

[01:27:20.490 --> 01:27:20.750]
Okay.

[01:27:21.190 --> 01:27:23.250]
I'm just calling to say hello, love the show.

[01:27:23.710 --> 01:27:26.190]
And I'd love to hear when you talk about

[01:27:26.190 --> 01:27:29.570]
your personal life because we're a lot of the store at work.

[01:27:30.030 --> 01:27:32.270]
And we like to hear the people you run into

[01:27:32.270 --> 01:27:33.110]
and your funny stories.

[01:27:33.230 --> 01:27:34.470]
That's what I like to hear.

[01:27:35.530 --> 01:27:35.810]
Okay.

[01:27:35.970 --> 01:27:37.310]
Well, I run over as many as I can.

[01:27:37.450 --> 01:27:38.710]
Of course, that's that's when I was driving.

[01:27:38.950 --> 01:27:40.030]
I don't have no car here.

[01:27:40.030 --> 01:27:41.430]
I can't run over too many people.

[01:27:43.470 --> 01:27:45.770]
In fact, you're so polite here that if you run over Canadians,

[01:27:46.010 --> 01:27:46.430]
they do oops.

[01:27:46.610 --> 01:27:47.050]
Oh, sorry.

[01:27:47.710 --> 01:27:48.730]
Sorry, I got in your way.

[01:27:49.950 --> 01:27:51.790]
Her birthday, you know how old she is?

[01:27:54.390 --> 01:27:55.050]
How old is she?

[01:27:55.610 --> 01:27:57.110]
That guy was a lot closer than the other ones.

[01:27:57.210 --> 01:27:57.710]
He's 49.

[01:27:58.450 --> 01:27:58.710]
Okay.

[01:28:00.230 --> 01:28:01.870]
So where did that other stuff come from?

[01:28:02.030 --> 01:28:02.390]
I don't know.

[01:28:02.790 --> 01:28:03.330]
We googled it.

[01:28:03.430 --> 01:28:03.950]
That's what you know.

[01:28:03.950 --> 01:28:05.930]
She went, well, was somebody gave us some bum information?

[01:28:06.730 --> 01:28:07.550]
This one says,

[01:28:07.550 --> 01:28:10.330]
birthday, February 1857, it would make her 49.

[01:28:11.170 --> 01:28:12.850]
So that guy was much closer than I was.

[01:28:12.990 --> 01:28:14.090]
Let's find all the other ones.

[01:28:14.310 --> 01:28:15.050]
You ought to apologize.

[01:28:15.370 --> 01:28:15.930]
Yeah, I'm sorry.

[01:28:16.590 --> 01:28:18.430]
We ought to find a whole bunch of dates

[01:28:18.430 --> 01:28:19.530]
and then just average them out.

[01:28:22.630 --> 01:28:22.950]
Okay.

[01:28:24.330 --> 01:28:26.070]
I mean, I know they got a lot of good makeup,

[01:28:26.090 --> 01:28:26.990]
just like some of these people

[01:28:26.990 --> 01:28:28.510]
been on these soap operas for a hundred years.

[01:28:28.710 --> 01:28:29.990]
Oh, by the way, Ross Marlowe,

[01:28:30.070 --> 01:28:31.270]
they couldn't afford to pay him anymore.

[01:28:31.390 --> 01:28:32.350]
I'm guiding him like he went to ABC

[01:28:32.350 --> 01:28:33.930]
so now they kill them off in a plane crash.

[01:28:34.290 --> 01:28:34.890]
Likely story.

[01:28:35.150 --> 01:28:36.250]
I mean, you people are pathetic.

[01:28:37.550 --> 01:28:39.450]
Let's see, Pat SayJack biography.

[01:28:40.610 --> 01:28:42.810]
Born October 26, 1946.

[01:28:43.690 --> 01:28:45.850]
So 54, he said, he said, I was right on him.

[01:28:45.850 --> 01:28:46.450]
He's 59.

[01:28:47.690 --> 01:28:47.970]
Okay.

[01:28:48.270 --> 01:28:49.590]
So in other words, he didn't change it.

[01:28:50.290 --> 01:28:52.690]
I have a feeling that she must have changed hers

[01:28:52.690 --> 01:28:54.070]
because he didn't see my state.

[01:28:54.070 --> 01:28:54.830]
She was 57.

[01:28:54.950 --> 01:28:55.490]
He was 59.

[01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:56.130]
Uh-huh.

[01:28:56.350 --> 01:28:57.190]
Well, he is 59.

[01:28:57.490 --> 01:28:57.830]
Okay.

[01:28:58.230 --> 01:28:59.170]
And I'm not buying it.

[01:28:59.250 --> 01:29:01.910]
She's all of a sudden she went from 57 like 49.

[01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:03.310]
And then this guy's got a 48.

[01:29:03.570 --> 01:29:05.230]
Pretty sure he's going to be a teenager again.

[01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:06.470]
That's a charo did.

[01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:07.690]
She got her age legally.

[01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:08.350]
Charo.

[01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:08.710]
Ooh.

[01:29:09.010 --> 01:29:09.290]
Charo.

[01:29:09.690 --> 01:29:10.350]
Kuchi kuchi.

[01:29:10.510 --> 01:29:11.470]
I didn't even know you could do that.

[01:29:12.590 --> 01:29:12.750]
What?

[01:29:12.930 --> 01:29:13.350]
Charo?

[01:29:13.510 --> 01:29:15.050]
That she changed her age legally.

[01:29:15.570 --> 01:29:16.170]
I can do it.

[01:29:16.990 --> 01:29:18.990]
Spring is barely here but the gasoline prices

[01:29:18.990 --> 01:29:21.430]
have already begun climbing toward perhaps beyond

[01:29:21.430 --> 01:29:24.890]
$3 a gallon for the summer driving season.

[01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:27.610]
There's more play than usual anticipation

[01:29:27.610 --> 01:29:29.190]
of increased demand for vacationers

[01:29:29.190 --> 01:29:31.090]
so they can rip you off and bleed you dry.

[01:29:31.650 --> 01:29:33.470]
Oil refineries are working through major changes

[01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:35.510]
to the composition of gasoline and diesel fuel.

[01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:38.610]
With Kuroa prices already $9 a barrel higher than a year ago

[01:29:38.610 --> 01:29:40.610]
because of those ragheads over there in Saudi Arabia

[01:29:40.610 --> 01:29:43.530]
and because we got Hibo Charo's all Piod and Ben-Athuela.

[01:29:44.750 --> 01:29:45.790]
Analysts, expect to...

[01:29:45.790 --> 01:29:46.470]
You know something serious.

[01:29:46.610 --> 01:29:47.990]
The Saudis make me so angry.

[01:29:48.150 --> 01:29:49.790]
I sold a little bit of the Fahrenheit again last night.

[01:29:50.270 --> 01:29:52.090]
And when I showed the scene there in the middle of the movie

[01:29:52.090 --> 01:29:53.430]
with the ragheads sitting around

[01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:56.170]
and then there's Bush one shaking their hands.

[01:29:56.310 --> 01:29:57.310]
Oh yeah, my good friend.

[01:29:57.650 --> 01:29:59.350]
Yeah, my good Carlaw group friends.

[01:30:00.330 --> 01:30:02.090]
I just want to vomit when I see that.

[01:30:02.190 --> 01:30:05.190]
I just want to go like right on my expensive Samsung

[01:30:05.190 --> 01:30:07.170]
46 in screen but I don't do it.

[01:30:08.090 --> 01:30:09.310]
God, does it make me sick?

[01:30:11.550 --> 01:30:14.230]
And remember in the movie then they show it from a distance too.

[01:30:14.370 --> 01:30:15.490]
They should have showed it close up.

[01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:16.750]
We'd have probably all puked.

[01:30:16.930 --> 01:30:20.010]
We'd have like having a public be heading in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia.

[01:30:20.910 --> 01:30:21.430]
Remember that?

[01:30:21.890 --> 01:30:22.150]
Yeah.

[01:30:22.530 --> 01:30:24.110]
And they show that scene from a very far

[01:30:24.110 --> 01:30:25.490]
from a long distance shot and they're like

[01:30:25.490 --> 01:30:26.830]
they just shot the guys head off

[01:30:26.830 --> 01:30:28.030]
and the head goes rolling one way

[01:30:28.030 --> 01:30:29.110]
and the body flops the other way.

[01:30:29.250 --> 01:30:30.490]
Hey, there's those good those

[01:30:30.870 --> 01:30:32.070]
civilized people of the Saudis.

[01:30:32.310 --> 01:30:34.050]
Two bandier rackies can be more like them.

[01:30:34.050 --> 01:30:35.370]
It wasn't a clean cut either.

[01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:37.550]
He had a whack at a couple of times.

[01:30:37.930 --> 01:30:37.930]

[01:30:38.370 --> 01:30:39.030]
Oh God.

[01:30:39.870 --> 01:30:42.030]
In the last month average gasoline prices

[01:30:42.030 --> 01:30:45.590]
in Philadelphia have clients if we care about them.

[01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:47.190]
Climb up about 30 minutes.

[01:30:47.190 --> 01:30:49.690]
In a sense of gallon or 13% to 260 a gallon.

[01:30:50.290 --> 01:30:52.550]
Tripoli mid-Atlantic reports in South Jersey

[01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:54.310]
the three day average was 242.

[01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:58.110]
Mark Braverman of Jamison has noticed the upturn

[01:30:58.110 --> 01:30:59.690]
because of the park to 12 mile a gallon

[01:30:59.690 --> 01:31:02.530]
Lincoln Aviator in favor of a sob 9-3 convertible

[01:31:02.530 --> 01:31:04.330]
which gets 24 miles to a gallon.

[01:31:04.490 --> 01:31:05.990]
If I have a vehicle that gets better my

[01:31:05.990 --> 01:31:08.530]
license economics he said after gasping up

[01:31:08.530 --> 01:31:09.470]
he was gasping it.

[01:31:10.110 --> 01:31:11.530]
The federal government reports yesterday

[01:31:11.530 --> 01:31:12.910]
that gasoline inventors had declined

[01:31:12.910 --> 01:31:14.050]
for the fifth straight week.

[01:31:14.370 --> 01:31:16.990]
Maintaining upward pressure is Maria Bacteromo

[01:31:16.990 --> 01:31:18.990]
would say with those heavy bags under her eyes.

[01:31:19.310 --> 01:31:21.530]
Maria Bacteromo there's pressure pressure.

[01:31:22.430 --> 01:31:24.130]
Maintaining upward pressure on prices.

[01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:25.610]
It's going to be another summer of very

[01:31:25.610 --> 01:31:27.770]
vulnerable prices with $3 as well within reach

[01:31:27.770 --> 01:31:30.390]
for the Ben Rockwell Editor-in-Chief

[01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:32.710]
of the oil price information services.

[01:31:33.710 --> 01:31:35.830]
Oil price information services my ass.

[01:31:35.970 --> 01:31:37.950]
Now what is that another bogus organization

[01:31:37.950 --> 01:31:40.590]
and a bunch of clowns getting paid you know.

[01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:42.690]
Now that's probably why we got to pay so much for gas

[01:31:42.690 --> 01:31:44.390]
to pay for all these organizations.

[01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:47.490]
We'll screw them and the Pakistan under-present.

[01:31:47.670 --> 01:31:48.250]
Screw them too.

[01:31:49.970 --> 01:31:51.850]
We got 600 votes in and this or what?

[01:31:51.970 --> 01:31:53.910]
Oh 651 we got to shout at something.

[01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:54.830]
I don't know what it is.

[01:31:55.030 --> 01:31:56.610]
I think if Joshua had been really pushing it

[01:31:56.610 --> 01:31:57.710]
we'd still made a thousand.

[01:31:57.930 --> 01:31:59.270]
See you're such a defeatist man.

[01:31:59.270 --> 01:32:00.590]
Well so sorry.

[01:32:00.990 --> 01:32:03.570]
No no you got I understand you got other things to worry about.

[01:32:03.670 --> 01:32:05.970]
You got to be in a right frame of mind when Joe comes in

[01:32:05.970 --> 01:32:08.050]
and says what time's good for you for a little sit down.

[01:32:11.310 --> 01:32:13.490]
Yeah all right you know how you respond to that.

[01:32:13.550 --> 01:32:14.670]
Let me give you a little advice.

[01:32:14.910 --> 01:32:15.330]
Okay please.

[01:32:15.790 --> 01:32:18.370]
You'll hold up that finger and you say hey Joe sit on this.

[01:32:19.770 --> 01:32:20.510]
That'll do it.

[01:32:21.190 --> 01:32:22.090]
I recommend your thumb.

[01:32:22.410 --> 01:32:22.930]
You hold up your thumb.

[01:32:23.050 --> 01:32:25.990]
No no that's a little boy that's Tom Thumb

[01:32:26.550 --> 01:32:27.610]
who pulled out a plum.

[01:32:28.130 --> 01:32:29.350]
At least he said it was a plum.

[01:32:29.570 --> 01:32:30.210]
A little jack horde.

[01:32:30.970 --> 01:32:32.890]
Let's sat in the corner eating his curds and

[01:32:32.890 --> 01:32:33.850]
way with a little mousse muffin.

[01:32:34.170 --> 01:32:36.070]
And what is that curds and way by the way?

[01:32:36.850 --> 01:32:38.210]
And did you Google Van a white butt

[01:32:38.210 --> 01:32:39.930]
because I'm getting a little aggravated about this

[01:32:39.930 --> 01:32:41.090]
because I didn't make that up.

[01:32:41.210 --> 01:32:42.350]
I have no I have no problem.

[01:32:42.350 --> 01:32:43.390]
I watch that show every night.

[01:32:43.890 --> 01:32:45.130]
I mean she I could take her early.

[01:32:45.230 --> 01:32:46.350]
You know she's overrated.

[01:32:46.630 --> 01:32:48.390]
She has no no boobs at all none.

[01:32:48.770 --> 01:32:50.250]
She don't even have raisinettes.

[01:32:51.510 --> 01:32:53.450]
I mean for nine years I don't look too bad.

[01:32:53.930 --> 01:32:54.030]
Huh?

[01:32:54.850 --> 01:32:55.890]
Did you Google it out loud?

[01:32:55.890 --> 01:32:56.650]
Data births.

[01:32:56.690 --> 01:32:59.590]
February 18th 1957 is the first result that came up.

[01:32:59.870 --> 01:33:01.990]
Yeah well that's what I just got from my MDV.

[01:33:02.250 --> 01:33:05.070]
And then come up with a better one on that.

[01:33:07.170 --> 01:33:09.850]
Because you know these brawds man they like to change their age

[01:33:09.850 --> 01:33:11.070]
they like to shuffle it around.

[01:33:12.210 --> 01:33:13.790]
She probably found out it got out of the closet

[01:33:13.790 --> 01:33:15.270]
that she was like a hundred years old

[01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:16.230]
so they changed it again.

[01:33:17.010 --> 01:33:18.950]
Now I know I got that right off.

[01:33:19.190 --> 01:33:19.990]
I googled it.

[01:33:21.550 --> 01:33:22.790]
Do you find any other ones?

[01:33:23.830 --> 01:33:24.830]
Look at it.

[01:33:24.830 --> 01:33:25.590]
Well make up some.

[01:33:27.210 --> 01:33:29.990]
658 votes man if we got to like 750 by the top of the R

[01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:31.890]
which of course couldn't happen but if we did.

[01:33:32.750 --> 01:33:34.810]
It's all ares fault that's what we're going to blame today.

[01:33:34.970 --> 01:33:37.010]
It's all ares fault for screwing off yesterday.

[01:33:37.250 --> 01:33:40.450]
Freighting them many many results with February 18th 1957.

[01:33:40.930 --> 01:33:41.970]
Told you she's 49.

[01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:45.370]
So that's so that guy because it's already April now.

[01:33:45.610 --> 01:33:46.510]
So he wasn't right either.

[01:33:47.470 --> 01:33:49.430]
Although he didn't inspire me to look it up again.

[01:33:49.510 --> 01:33:50.390]
Okay so we can correct that.

[01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:51.430]
We don't we don't want to be spread.

[01:33:51.430 --> 01:33:52.550]
This is the whole misinformation about van.

[01:33:52.570 --> 01:33:54.290]
We just send a big apology card to Van.

[01:33:54.510 --> 01:33:57.470]
Yeah send her a big apology for rooting her career.

[01:33:57.570 --> 01:33:59.290]
Say what's the big mcia here's an apology.

[01:33:59.610 --> 01:34:01.250]
Yet the money she's getting paid to stand there

[01:34:01.250 --> 01:34:03.790]
and pretending to be turning letters and stand there

[01:34:03.790 --> 01:34:05.250]
and like that.

[01:34:05.610 --> 01:34:06.270]
Oh god.

[01:34:06.850 --> 01:34:08.650]
Can you imagine you worried about 58 bucks?

[01:34:11.050 --> 01:34:11.790]
WQAM hello.

[01:34:12.330 --> 01:34:14.730]
Robert could you lend a dime to an old old boy

[01:34:14.730 --> 01:34:16.490]
for a cup of coffee on the Catholic?

[01:34:17.830 --> 01:34:18.590]
WQAM hello.

[01:34:18.590 --> 01:34:19.990]
Hey Neil how are you doing today?

[01:34:20.190 --> 01:34:20.310]
Okay.

[01:34:20.770 --> 01:34:22.110]
You know this oil.

[01:34:22.730 --> 01:34:24.770]
There'll be oil price story that you just read there.

[01:34:25.050 --> 01:34:25.890]
This $3 a gallon.

[01:34:26.190 --> 01:34:28.510]
Remember the oil companies did a survey last year

[01:34:29.090 --> 01:34:31.570]
saying that Americans would accept up to $3 a gallon?

[01:34:31.970 --> 01:34:32.210]
Yeah.

[01:34:32.370 --> 01:34:34.050]
I seem to remember you've got you reading that story.

[01:34:34.370 --> 01:34:34.550]
Yes.

[01:34:34.810 --> 01:34:36.330]
Well you know the one domain.

[01:34:36.410 --> 01:34:38.170]
Well no except whatever it takes they don't care.

[01:34:38.510 --> 01:34:38.710]
Yeah.

[01:34:38.850 --> 01:34:39.090]
Five bucks.

[01:34:39.270 --> 01:34:41.370]
Like that rocket scientist who figured out

[01:34:41.370 --> 01:34:43.730]
that he should drive a sob instead of a suburban you know.

[01:34:44.170 --> 01:34:44.330]
Yeah.

[01:34:44.750 --> 01:34:48.050]
But it's the oil companies that have I read in the Houston Chronicle

[01:34:48.050 --> 01:34:51.950]
just a few weeks ago that the oil companies have reduced their

[01:34:51.950 --> 01:34:54.390]
refinery output by 10 to 15 percent.

[01:34:55.110 --> 01:34:57.690]
And here's why I read it in the business section.

[01:34:58.190 --> 01:35:01.490]
Here's why because of lagging quarterly profits.

[01:35:01.750 --> 01:35:02.350]
Was there a claim?

[01:35:02.890 --> 01:35:03.470]
How do you like that?

[01:35:03.710 --> 01:35:05.630]
That's interesting because I just got through reading about

[01:35:07.070 --> 01:35:09.030]
record profits for all these companies.

[01:35:09.310 --> 01:35:11.210]
I think the real reason is that they believe in one thing.

[01:35:11.470 --> 01:35:11.610]
Yeah.

[01:35:11.610 --> 01:35:12.570]
Banging rate is funny.

[01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:12.830]

[01:35:12.990 --> 01:35:13.510]
Yeah exactly.

[01:35:13.730 --> 01:35:17.190]
But another thing I have for you in the proof that even a stop

[01:35:17.190 --> 01:35:19.130]
clock is right one today.

[01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:22.430]
There's a check out the Fred Grimm column today.

[01:35:23.010 --> 01:35:25.230]
It's about Catherine Harris and her connection to this

[01:35:25.230 --> 01:35:28.410]
dominionist preacher that she went to school this

[01:35:28.410 --> 01:35:29.950]
with preacher.

[01:35:29.950 --> 01:35:30.470]
He's here to guard?

[01:35:30.670 --> 01:35:30.850]
Yeah.

[01:35:30.990 --> 01:35:34.350]
This guy that she went to that was her mentor you know

[01:35:34.350 --> 01:35:35.230]
of her religious mentor.

[01:35:35.570 --> 01:35:38.070]
You read a short story about that a couple weeks ago.

[01:35:38.330 --> 01:35:42.290]
But check out the Fred Grimm's op-ed column today.

[01:35:42.310 --> 01:35:43.170]
Don't forget to me.

[01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:43.470]
Okay.

[01:35:43.590 --> 01:35:45.150]
Well say about how he thank you so much.

[01:35:45.330 --> 01:35:46.270]
Check out Fred Grimm in the room.

[01:35:47.190 --> 01:35:49.910]
So we find out a hundred more websites and she's still 49.

[01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:54.090]
Aren't you relieved at that that she's only 49?

[01:35:54.370 --> 01:35:54.550]
No.

[01:35:54.890 --> 01:35:55.550]
I could care less.

[01:35:55.790 --> 01:35:56.550]
I could care how old she is.

[01:35:56.570 --> 01:35:57.210]
She's 109.

[01:35:57.490 --> 01:35:59.550]
She's just she's just like a window dressing

[01:35:59.550 --> 01:36:01.650]
and not not good dressing like salad dressing.

[01:36:01.870 --> 01:36:03.110]
Only a little little launching.

[01:36:04.970 --> 01:36:05.650]
672 votes.

[01:36:05.790 --> 01:36:08.230]
You realize it could easily be like 972 right now.

[01:36:09.090 --> 01:36:09.490]
172.

[01:36:10.170 --> 01:36:10.570]
1272.

[01:36:11.570 --> 01:36:14.170]
1572 could be like a real boost to our ego at a time when we

[01:36:14.170 --> 01:36:14.950]
needed it so badly.

[01:36:15.330 --> 01:36:15.870]
So desperately.

[01:36:16.670 --> 01:36:19.630]
When our mismanagement is just flailing and floundering around.

[01:36:20.250 --> 01:36:22.250]
Hey everybody like me if you like me.

[01:36:23.010 --> 01:36:25.690]
Maybe if he keeps coming in there and depending on the back you like him.

[01:36:26.890 --> 01:36:28.890]
Or maybe if he actually signs that deal with norm.

[01:36:30.530 --> 01:36:30.930]
Okay.

[01:36:31.250 --> 01:36:32.110]
Because I'll tell you one thing.

[01:36:32.170 --> 01:36:34.010]
No seriously if you don't if you don't talk to Santino

[01:36:34.010 --> 01:36:34.970]
when they're making that deal.

[01:36:35.650 --> 01:36:36.870]
You're gonna have some real tourists.

[01:36:36.970 --> 01:36:38.170]
You think 58 bucks was bad.

[01:36:40.270 --> 01:36:40.670]
5670560.

[01:36:41.050 --> 01:36:43.230]
0560 on the Verizon singular wireless line.

[01:36:43.230 --> 01:36:44.990]
Just rollin' long singing a song.

[01:36:45.470 --> 01:36:46.950]
George on vacation next week.

[01:36:47.090 --> 01:36:48.530]
I'll be on vacation a week after that.

[01:36:50.110 --> 01:36:53.030]
And of course come June whatever it is the middle of June there.

[01:36:53.170 --> 01:36:56.630]
Another vacation for me and then we go on at George three days a week.

[01:36:56.830 --> 01:36:59.590]
I only work two days and three days in the summertime to which I say.

[01:36:59.850 --> 01:37:00.710]
I sure apologize.

[01:37:00.910 --> 01:37:02.030]
I feel so bad about that.

[01:37:02.230 --> 01:37:02.650]
Yeah right.

[01:37:03.290 --> 01:37:04.650]
Feel really guilty about that.

[01:37:04.670 --> 01:37:06.830]
You probably drive all the vacation all summer long.

[01:37:07.010 --> 01:37:07.870]
You're not doing my duty.

[01:37:09.570 --> 01:37:10.310]
WQAN hello.

[01:37:11.230 --> 01:37:12.870]
We've had dies in.

[01:37:14.030 --> 01:37:14.770]
WQAN hello.

[01:37:16.630 --> 01:37:18.970]
Oh I think this is the commitment of Paul.

[01:37:18.970 --> 01:37:19.790]
Oh it's all worth the time.

[01:37:19.970 --> 01:37:21.870]
This hands-on workshop addressing time.

[01:37:21.870 --> 01:37:22.970]
It's not the same rock.

[01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:23.550]
It's usually.

[01:37:23.690 --> 01:37:25.630]
It includes an exercise in title examination.

[01:37:26.190 --> 01:37:26.190]

[01:37:26.570 --> 01:37:27.790]
Using a stopper information.

[01:37:28.110 --> 01:37:28.310]
Surgeon's hand cover.

[01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:29.610]
It's a different page.

[01:37:30.370 --> 01:37:31.810]
That's not a little bit like Joyce to me.

[01:37:32.310 --> 01:37:33.190]
WQAN hello.

[01:37:33.770 --> 01:37:36.570]
When I saw that crucifix I said hello again.

[01:37:36.790 --> 01:37:36.950]
Other.

[01:37:38.910 --> 01:37:39.810]
WQAN hello.

[01:37:40.410 --> 01:37:40.810]
No.

[01:37:41.230 --> 01:37:42.010]
Bad Linda Blair.

[01:37:42.150 --> 01:37:42.730]
Yes ma'am.

[01:37:42.870 --> 01:37:43.790]
How are you?

[01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:44.350]
Good.

[01:37:44.810 --> 01:37:45.270]
Good.

[01:37:45.670 --> 01:37:47.370]
Listen I'm keeping first.

[01:37:47.970 --> 01:37:51.790]
I got the best of feeding and I was wondering how I could exchange it

[01:37:51.790 --> 01:37:54.750]
because it's something it's messed up and it's skipping.

[01:37:55.810 --> 01:37:58.550]
Are there any left to be able to exchange that?

[01:37:58.830 --> 01:38:00.030]
Oh there's a couple left yet.

[01:38:00.170 --> 01:38:01.050]
There's a few around them.

[01:38:01.150 --> 01:38:02.730]
How would I go about doing that?

[01:38:03.870 --> 01:38:05.150]
Are there any left to do with that?

[01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:07.090]
There's a few guys that are ones that came up with this.

[01:38:07.230 --> 01:38:08.010]
They're welcoming me idea.

[01:38:09.330 --> 01:38:12.430]
You could bring it to the station and get one or something.

[01:38:13.110 --> 01:38:16.290]
I tell you guys going to be around anywhere that I can

[01:38:16.290 --> 01:38:19.490]
you know meet the van or maybe.

[01:38:20.390 --> 01:38:21.590]
Maybe I'll meet the van.

[01:38:21.850 --> 01:38:24.830]
That's another department but how about this put her on hold we'll get her number.

[01:38:25.070 --> 01:38:26.090]
Okay I'm going to put you on hold.

[01:38:26.090 --> 01:38:30.390]
Give it to the appropriate parties or have someone contact her like either.

[01:38:30.470 --> 01:38:33.210]
We'll have them in fact we'll have them get on the camera right here.

[01:38:33.210 --> 01:38:34.270]
I'll give you one.

[01:38:35.350 --> 01:38:36.430]
Bring it to your house and give you a raise.

[01:38:36.610 --> 01:38:37.330]
I'll give you a raise for the trouble.

[01:38:37.970 --> 01:38:38.210]
Hello.

[01:38:39.270 --> 01:38:40.770]
I need to go out in Canada.

[01:38:43.710 --> 01:38:44.830]
You think you hung up on her?

[01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:45.150]
Yeah.

[01:38:46.030 --> 01:38:47.170]
Did I hang up on her?

[01:38:47.950 --> 01:38:49.410]
She'll call back if that's what I think.

[01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:52.870]
Well what was that?

[01:38:53.130 --> 01:38:53.910]
Well what that was that?

[01:38:54.670 --> 01:38:56.450]
Either you hung up on her or it was a joke.

[01:38:56.710 --> 01:38:56.950]
You did?

[01:38:57.490 --> 01:38:57.850]
Oh okay.

[01:38:58.010 --> 01:38:58.510]
I hung up on her.

[01:38:58.510 --> 01:38:59.150]
That was a story to happen.

[01:38:59.550 --> 01:38:59.550]

[01:38:59.830 --> 01:39:01.090]
No, he saw it happen.

[01:39:01.710 --> 01:39:03.750]
That's right he saw you hang up on her and put her on hold.

[01:39:03.750 --> 01:39:05.030]
You can see which finger I'm holding on.

[01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:07.450]
This is the new Roger.

[01:39:07.450 --> 01:39:08.230]
Looks like a finger.

[01:39:08.770 --> 01:39:11.470]
This is 5.62.8.

[01:39:14.410 --> 01:39:18.790]
Mr. King, I'd like to relax by having Mary Magno in the side of my balls while listening to the

[01:39:18.790 --> 01:39:19.930]
Neil Rogers 12th of one hour.

[01:39:30.410 --> 01:39:32.550]
Every job that's got one

[01:39:32.550 --> 01:39:37.270]
like 7 million made of border runs.

[01:39:37.530 --> 01:39:44.070]
I hear on protest for the rights of an alien they say this law is so.

[01:39:46.850 --> 01:39:52.990]
Our heli calls are Spanish speaking foreign people.

[01:39:53.930 --> 01:39:57.870]
They've got a reason for the event.

[01:39:58.490 --> 01:40:01.410]
They even go to my school.

[01:40:03.010 --> 01:40:07.850]
And then they say these thoughts made good enough.

[01:40:08.290 --> 01:40:13.090]
They just said on a corner to you fit them up.

[01:40:13.330 --> 01:40:18.310]
It would change their life if they didn't take your food.

[01:40:19.550 --> 01:40:22.530]
And we're all so screwed.

[01:40:24.130 --> 01:40:28.570]
And it's not just politicians who are playing the fool.

[01:40:28.570 --> 01:40:32.870]
We're filled with all this emotion that we can get through.

[01:40:33.430 --> 01:40:37.190]
They take the kind of job that we do not want to do.

[01:40:37.630 --> 01:40:42.110]
Give them green cards make it legal or else shut up for found it.

[01:40:44.590 --> 01:40:48.270]
I'm a Googling like crazy or it's his van a white just turned 117.

[01:40:48.590 --> 01:40:49.330]
Now is that possible?

[01:40:49.470 --> 01:40:50.370]
Is that just the propaganda?

[01:40:50.570 --> 01:40:51.470]
That's right she's mummified.

[01:40:51.910 --> 01:40:52.890]
Is that proper gander?

[01:40:54.650 --> 01:40:57.310]
And then I Google a van and I get past sage act.

[01:40:57.750 --> 01:40:58.970]
Talk about joined at the hip.

[01:41:00.490 --> 01:41:05.150]
Anyway, when you get off that wheel of fortune crap 5 6 7 0 5 6 you get that lady called

[01:41:05.150 --> 01:41:06.690]
you know don't call it again.

[01:41:06.870 --> 01:41:09.890]
I mean see that's another reason I think involved in that stuff.

[01:41:10.110 --> 01:41:12.290]
It's defective or what do I do?

[01:41:13.130 --> 01:41:14.130]
What are we going to begin?

[01:41:14.250 --> 01:41:15.630]
We already had a zit in those calls.

[01:41:15.910 --> 01:41:19.870]
You know like when we're going to get it already I ordered like five minutes ago that stuff.

[01:41:20.070 --> 01:41:22.190]
You mean that outpouring of appreciation that we always got?

[01:41:22.190 --> 01:41:22.570]
Yeah.

[01:41:22.630 --> 01:41:23.010]
Yeah.

[01:41:25.310 --> 01:41:29.790]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 and a variety of things to run us lines.

[01:41:29.970 --> 01:41:31.210]
WDQ way in order line.

[01:41:31.210 --> 01:41:31.470]
Hello.

[01:41:32.130 --> 01:41:35.070]
Hey Neil it's more it's more fake and you hung up on me.

[01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:36.550]
Well I was strictly an accident.

[01:41:37.050 --> 01:41:40.630]
I don't want to say something else if I might.

[01:41:40.950 --> 01:41:41.410]
Go ahead.

[01:41:41.870 --> 01:41:46.650]
Oh okay well actually to George George did you grow up like that just born again?

[01:41:47.330 --> 01:41:49.230]
I spent some time but I didn't grow up that way.

[01:41:49.230 --> 01:41:51.910]
I grew up Catholic but I spent some time being born again.

[01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:58.350]
Oh okay well it's a regular Bible different from the Christian Bible or the Catholic Bible.

[01:41:58.590 --> 01:42:02.250]
The Catholic Bible is different from the King James version if that's what you're asking.

[01:42:02.910 --> 01:42:09.410]
Okay because some people pointed out to me it says in Revelation and I was just wondering how

[01:42:09.410 --> 01:42:11.330]
you know if this is true or not.

[01:42:11.490 --> 01:42:12.010]
It says.

[01:42:12.010 --> 01:42:17.110]
So I testify under every man that here is the word of the prophecy of this book.

[01:42:17.250 --> 01:42:18.390]
Is any man?

[01:42:22.090 --> 01:42:22.770]
Oh what happened?

[01:42:23.010 --> 01:42:23.990]
I think I hung up on it already.

[01:42:24.030 --> 01:42:25.930]
Oh no no we didn't remember we got our number.

[01:42:26.790 --> 01:42:28.610]
Good thing you did that before I went into a coma.

[01:42:29.870 --> 01:42:33.470]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 and a variety of things to do.

[01:42:33.490 --> 01:42:34.930]
I'm going to have to dip back into my poem.

[01:42:35.110 --> 01:42:37.430]
I'm going to see these people are definitely material.

[01:42:37.750 --> 01:42:39.310]
They're getting their matsu ready for next week.

[01:42:39.310 --> 01:42:42.610]
You can go to bible.com and it'll list any further.

[01:42:42.610 --> 01:42:43.670]
Why are you telling her that?

[01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:45.690]
Any version that you want to get her?

[01:42:45.770 --> 01:42:46.250]
Who cares off our ass?

[01:42:46.410 --> 01:42:47.250]
Who cares?

[01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:49.910]
Well she's off our ass because she's hung up on her ring.

[01:42:49.970 --> 01:42:50.710]
Oh she'll be back.

[01:42:51.070 --> 01:42:51.670]
Bible.com.

[01:42:52.050 --> 01:42:53.210]
What's she's going to get the same response?

[01:42:53.590 --> 01:42:56.330]
Okay I think God purpose a gate with effective V.C.D.

[01:42:56.510 --> 01:42:56.630]
Right.

[01:42:57.190 --> 01:42:58.450]
You can look up any version of you.

[01:42:59.110 --> 01:43:00.250]
Who cares what it says?

[01:43:00.530 --> 01:43:04.370]
Does the King James say this and the King Edward and King George and King Ashweta?

[01:43:04.690 --> 01:43:05.230]
Who cares?

[01:43:05.930 --> 01:43:06.790]
Get with it.

[01:43:07.230 --> 01:43:08.250]
Stop with the nonsense.

[01:43:09.390 --> 01:43:10.510]
70 Q.A.M. Hello.

[01:43:11.130 --> 01:43:12.570]
Man that was ponderous.

[01:43:12.590 --> 01:43:13.450]
That was almost like the first.

[01:43:13.450 --> 01:43:14.950]
All this is ponderous is this yeah.

[01:43:17.110 --> 01:43:18.290]
70 Q.A.M. Hello.

[01:43:19.050 --> 01:43:21.190]
Yeah how do I exchange this V.D.

[01:43:21.530 --> 01:43:23.210]
instead of just hanging up on me?

[01:43:28.130 --> 01:43:28.530]
What?

[01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:32.410]
I think it was an active guide.

[01:43:33.390 --> 01:43:34.410]
It wasn't I could go.

[01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:35.030]
It was a deal.

[01:43:35.710 --> 01:43:36.690]
Don't call me again.

[01:43:36.750 --> 01:43:38.130]
Okay I don't want to talk to you.

[01:43:38.130 --> 01:43:39.570]
Call George at home.

[01:43:40.350 --> 01:43:42.690]
Send him a picture maybe he'll come over and deliver you a new one.

[01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:44.170]
I just can't do like that.

[01:43:44.370 --> 01:43:45.310]
They'll bring both my body.

[01:43:45.330 --> 01:43:46.390]
Try to be very nice.

[01:43:46.670 --> 01:43:47.390]
I tried like you.

[01:43:47.470 --> 01:43:49.690]
I hit the wrong button the first time disconnected.

[01:43:49.930 --> 01:43:51.330]
I mean the right button now though.

[01:43:53.010 --> 01:43:57.950]
I wanted to put around hold so you could like do nice by her because she helped us out.

[01:43:58.470 --> 01:43:59.270]
Never again.

[01:43:59.690 --> 01:44:00.950]
Never again with the CD.

[01:44:01.070 --> 01:44:03.510]
You know that's when you need to beat the crap out of that.

[01:44:03.670 --> 01:44:04.590]
That's you fair.

[01:44:04.690 --> 01:44:05.170]
Oh God.

[01:44:05.170 --> 01:44:05.930]
How about this?

[01:44:06.050 --> 01:44:08.330]
Email me Jorge at Neil Rogers dot com.

[01:44:08.330 --> 01:44:08.810]
There you go.

[01:44:08.910 --> 01:44:09.870]
He'll take care of it.

[01:44:09.950 --> 01:44:10.910]
I'll take care of the CD.

[01:44:11.290 --> 01:44:12.010]
The O-R-G-E.

[01:44:12.130 --> 01:44:12.430]
That's right.

[01:44:12.430 --> 01:44:12.670]
Jorge.

[01:44:13.370 --> 01:44:14.370]
The Bible story.

[01:44:14.450 --> 01:44:15.010]
Don't ask you.

[01:44:15.110 --> 01:44:16.070]
Were you like a born again?

[01:44:16.330 --> 01:44:17.890]
Were you like born the first time?

[01:44:18.070 --> 01:44:20.870]
Were you like uh do they forget to take away the umbilical cord?

[01:44:21.130 --> 01:44:22.430]
The good news is I'm dead again now.

[01:44:22.570 --> 01:44:23.650]
I don't want to hear the good news.

[01:44:23.790 --> 01:44:25.410]
I know I know it's from the bad news.

[01:44:25.750 --> 01:44:27.010]
Most of it comes from that place.

[01:44:28.430 --> 01:44:29.470]
WDQA and Religion class.

[01:44:29.650 --> 01:44:29.810]
Hello.

[01:44:30.310 --> 01:44:32.570]
He's a grandpa at night at 2AM.

[01:44:32.670 --> 01:44:32.790]
Hello.

[01:44:33.290 --> 01:44:33.470]
Hello.

[01:44:34.150 --> 01:44:35.350]
Definitely he rots in hell.

[01:44:35.490 --> 01:44:35.830]
Yes sir.

[01:44:36.290 --> 01:44:37.190]
That says Neil Rogers.

[01:44:37.570 --> 01:44:37.930]
Yes.

[01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:39.550]
I'm sorry I could hear you.

[01:44:39.970 --> 01:44:42.550]
Um I was wondering if you would take a call regarding the third

[01:44:42.550 --> 01:44:44.330]
but the horse is just a biblical talk.

[01:44:45.650 --> 01:44:46.370]
Surabran horses?

[01:44:46.950 --> 01:44:49.890]
Yes I want to say with a good time I had down at the New Gulf Stream

[01:44:49.890 --> 01:44:52.310]
and I don't know if you had a little interest you but I just started

[01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:52.590]
playing around with that.

[01:44:52.590 --> 01:44:55.030]
I'm in terminal coma inducing man.

[01:44:55.690 --> 01:44:58.090]
I'd rather talk to that the broad again about her CD.

[01:44:59.710 --> 01:45:01.090]
He had a good time with the New Gulf Stream.

[01:45:01.210 --> 01:45:02.610]
He didn't sound old enough to go to Gulf Stream.

[01:45:02.610 --> 01:45:07.150]
He had to be at least 100 and have ID and BYOB bring your own bag.

[01:45:07.950 --> 01:45:10.830]
Although I hear that Gary Puckett and Union Gap are going to be entertaining

[01:45:10.830 --> 01:45:13.130]
out there in the out in the parking lot.

[01:45:13.990 --> 01:45:16.790]
Not getting paid for it they're just they just got nothing else going on.

[01:45:16.950 --> 01:45:19.170]
So they're going to be like setting up there where a crap in the parking lot.

[01:45:19.510 --> 01:45:20.410]
Get away from me.

[01:45:21.810 --> 01:45:22.570]
WDQA and hello.

[01:45:23.390 --> 01:45:24.170]
How are you?

[01:45:24.570 --> 01:45:24.910]
Pretty good.

[01:45:25.670 --> 01:45:27.810]
All right just to let you know Chris Bush is back in town.

[01:45:28.010 --> 01:45:28.570]
Yeah okay good.

[01:45:30.070 --> 01:45:32.010]
567 05 60 pound 56.

[01:45:32.210 --> 01:45:33.450]
I told you they're going to be good to start.

[01:45:33.610 --> 01:45:35.170]
How many times do you call so far?

[01:45:35.250 --> 01:45:36.130]
About 30 minutes.

[01:45:36.170 --> 01:45:36.310]
Right.

[01:45:36.990 --> 01:45:38.810]
Not to mention that that flamer.

[01:45:39.330 --> 01:45:42.130]
What do you say something about Chris Bush's?

[01:45:42.230 --> 01:45:43.430]
I don't think that's what he said.

[01:45:43.730 --> 01:45:44.090]
We all know.

[01:45:44.850 --> 01:45:46.390]
We know a whole bunch of you.

[01:45:46.910 --> 01:45:47.690]
WDQA and hello.

[01:45:48.850 --> 01:45:52.370]
Okay so if I call five times in a row telling you that the shirt's too big

[01:45:52.370 --> 01:45:53.890]
the CD doesn't fit in the slot.

[01:45:54.130 --> 01:45:55.310]
Do I get the same kind of treatment?

[01:45:55.690 --> 01:45:55.890]
Yes.

[01:45:57.270 --> 01:45:57.590]
Unbelievable.

[01:45:57.630 --> 01:45:58.490]
Give us some pathetic.

[01:45:58.490 --> 01:46:01.510]
Well I wanted to give you guys an appreciative thanks because you know you guys

[01:46:01.510 --> 01:46:03.710]
who go through all this work and I hear all the song of the dance about

[01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:07.830]
nobody ever calls and everybody's with the stupid dancers of the CD scratch

[01:46:07.830 --> 01:46:09.770]
and do you have a phone and a meeting in the lot?

[01:46:10.410 --> 01:46:11.030]
I appreciate it.

[01:46:11.050 --> 01:46:12.490]
I'm bought up for the last couple of years.

[01:46:12.650 --> 01:46:15.250]
Well we appreciate the fact that you have to sound because believe you mean

[01:46:15.250 --> 01:46:15.890]
this is the worst.

[01:46:16.010 --> 01:46:17.250]
This is the most embarrassing.

[01:46:17.490 --> 01:46:19.630]
The worst thing I've ever been involved in my life.

[01:46:19.790 --> 01:46:21.890]
You know we've been doing this for years on different stations.

[01:46:22.350 --> 01:46:24.670]
And this thing is just degenerated to a point where it's

[01:46:24.670 --> 01:46:25.610]
well what's the point?

[01:46:26.030 --> 01:46:27.350]
Yeah it's just nobody cares.

[01:46:27.490 --> 01:46:27.910]
Nobody thinks.

[01:46:27.930 --> 01:46:30.970]
I don't download it off the internet although it's all over the place.

[01:46:31.250 --> 01:46:31.850]
I spend a lot of money.

[01:46:31.850 --> 01:46:32.150]
It is.

[01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:35.110]
Of course that's why it just reached a certain point and then it stops

[01:46:35.110 --> 01:46:37.270]
because they're all like grabbing it up for free you know.

[01:46:37.490 --> 01:46:37.650]
Yeah.

[01:46:38.110 --> 01:46:38.690]
It's a luge.

[01:46:39.230 --> 01:46:39.810]
All right have a good afternoon.

[01:46:40.030 --> 01:46:40.710]
Thanks a lot Pally.

[01:46:40.750 --> 01:46:41.650]
I appreciate it.

[01:46:41.650 --> 01:46:42.590]
See there's a good guy.

[01:46:43.490 --> 01:46:44.150]
It doesn't do.

[01:46:44.150 --> 01:46:46.930]
He doesn't have to call it and he knows it's out there for free.

[01:46:47.070 --> 01:46:49.730]
You can still in it but that and that's I told you that.

[01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:51.570]
That's why I wanted to be part of this thing.

[01:46:52.110 --> 01:46:53.170]
And you and your buddy Miguel.

[01:46:53.170 --> 01:46:54.490]
Oh no it's going to be great.

[01:46:54.610 --> 01:46:56.690]
You'll say right that's what we said.

[01:46:56.750 --> 01:46:59.470]
Now what's the either one of you is that you're fair enough.

[01:46:59.670 --> 01:47:00.890]
You know she don't come around no more.

[01:47:01.050 --> 01:47:01.790]
Was she in there this morning?

[01:47:02.150 --> 01:47:02.270]
No.

[01:47:02.710 --> 01:47:02.890]
No.

[01:47:03.630 --> 01:47:04.730]
And rightfully so.

[01:47:06.170 --> 01:47:06.530]
Boy.

[01:47:06.930 --> 01:47:09.990]
You see the whole the whole places is everything is upside down.

[01:47:10.230 --> 01:47:11.370]
People want to be in programming.

[01:47:11.370 --> 01:47:12.150]
They're in sales.

[01:47:12.590 --> 01:47:13.810]
People who want to be in sale.

[01:47:13.990 --> 01:47:15.370]
Who should not be in sales?

[01:47:15.630 --> 01:47:17.250]
Who ought to be out on the street panhandling?

[01:47:17.410 --> 01:47:18.390]
They're our sales department.

[01:47:19.530 --> 01:47:20.750]
People who want to be in the circus.

[01:47:20.830 --> 01:47:21.890]
They're like in management.

[01:47:21.890 --> 01:47:23.910]
You know people ought to be like playing bozo the clown.

[01:47:24.110 --> 01:47:24.870]
Hey Pally.

[01:47:25.850 --> 01:47:27.270]
That's everything going all right.

[01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:31.670]
Seriously it's like I've been in this business 100 years.

[01:47:31.810 --> 01:47:33.490]
I have never worked for a clown before.

[01:47:34.630 --> 01:47:35.910]
Oh I don't know about that.

[01:47:36.370 --> 01:47:37.850]
No I'm talking about a real clown.

[01:47:38.150 --> 01:47:39.630]
Although I will say that I don't know about

[01:47:39.630 --> 01:47:40.730]
Carabell and the Red Nose.

[01:47:41.050 --> 01:47:42.950]
That's exactly what I was thinking.

[01:47:43.170 --> 01:47:44.830]
I don't think about Greg Reed and the Red Nose.

[01:47:45.410 --> 01:47:46.850]
Oh and of course Mike Disney had a Red Nose.

[01:47:46.870 --> 01:47:47.990]
That's what I was in a different day.

[01:47:48.090 --> 01:47:48.850]
Different kind of Red Nose.

[01:47:49.390 --> 01:47:49.750]
Yeah.

[01:47:49.750 --> 01:47:49.810]
Yeah.

[01:47:51.110 --> 01:47:52.970]
What a what a long kid he is.

[01:47:53.030 --> 01:47:55.750]
Now what what a what a long a lump a human lump.

[01:47:56.210 --> 01:47:56.490]
Disney.

[01:47:57.950 --> 01:48:00.430]
The IOD days what I was really something.

[01:48:01.690 --> 01:48:03.830]
Remember him puking in the waist basket all that.

[01:48:05.290 --> 01:48:06.370]
Rio real loser.

[01:48:06.410 --> 01:48:07.110]
That's my opinion.

[01:48:07.350 --> 01:48:07.990]
I'm Mike Disney.

[01:48:08.130 --> 01:48:08.310]
Yeah.

[01:48:08.510 --> 01:48:08.950]
F me Ray.

[01:48:09.710 --> 01:48:10.730]
F me Ray genius.

[01:48:13.310 --> 01:48:13.710]
567.

[01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:14.750]
Oh 565.

[01:48:14.830 --> 01:48:15.110]
505.

[01:48:15.110 --> 01:48:15.390]
60.

[01:48:15.510 --> 01:48:17.210]
I wonder if he had a good time on St. Paddy's day.

[01:48:17.210 --> 01:48:18.170]
Hi Disney.

[01:48:18.290 --> 01:48:19.390]
Cargap and Vixen Lunch.

[01:48:19.670 --> 01:48:20.870]
No he didn't.

[01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:24.030]
Maybe Cheryl and Vixen Lunch and she can give you her Yanta routine again.

[01:48:24.250 --> 01:48:24.370]
Hi.

[01:48:24.630 --> 01:48:24.670]
Dave.

[01:48:25.030 --> 01:48:26.210]
Don't you want to talk to the princess?

[01:48:26.730 --> 01:48:28.030]
We've had so many princesses.

[01:48:28.070 --> 01:48:28.290]
Wow.

[01:48:29.170 --> 01:48:30.510]
The goddess in the princess.

[01:48:30.990 --> 01:48:31.430]
WQIAM.

[01:48:31.490 --> 01:48:31.650]
Hello.

[01:48:32.270 --> 01:48:32.570]
Hi.

[01:48:33.150 --> 01:48:36.510]
The CD is wonderful but I just can't hear it.

[01:48:36.690 --> 01:48:39.810]
And I was I wasn't quoting the Bible.

[01:48:40.050 --> 01:48:41.050]
I was who is this?

[01:48:41.170 --> 01:48:41.730]
Who is this?

[01:48:41.950 --> 01:48:42.650]
Is this you again?

[01:48:42.990 --> 01:48:44.290]
I was agreeing with you.

[01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:45.250]
Is this you again?

[01:48:45.610 --> 01:48:46.030]
I was.

[01:48:46.030 --> 01:48:46.030]

[01:48:48.870 --> 01:48:49.230]
Hi.

[01:48:49.650 --> 01:48:50.010]
Hi.

[01:48:59.570 --> 01:49:02.730]
Didn't you just give out on a year your email address for you to like have her?

[01:49:03.190 --> 01:49:06.050]
You know we have done everything except come to your house and give you a thousand

[01:49:06.050 --> 01:49:06.950]
dollars in cash.

[01:49:07.290 --> 01:49:10.730]
George's and I have no idea why because basically he's a hard hard and fast dude.

[01:49:11.090 --> 01:49:14.690]
But just because he's you know gets weak in the knees when he hears a female voice.

[01:49:14.690 --> 01:49:17.470]
Therefore he went along and gave it to email address.

[01:49:17.730 --> 01:49:18.450]
Email him.

[01:49:18.610 --> 01:49:20.890]
He will personally take care of it to see gets replaced.

[01:49:21.170 --> 01:49:24.970]
But no she keeps calling and calling and calling.

[01:49:26.810 --> 01:49:28.930]
And by the way here's another like Bernie gets would say.

[01:49:29.310 --> 01:49:30.130]
Here's another one for you.

[01:49:30.230 --> 01:49:30.870]
No extra charge.

[01:49:32.090 --> 01:49:33.350]
Oh there's that look at that.

[01:49:33.410 --> 01:49:36.810]
McKinney will vote in favor of the resolution honoring the capital police.

[01:49:37.090 --> 01:49:37.650]
Isn't that lovely?

[01:49:37.950 --> 01:49:39.350]
That's to try to make up for it I guess.

[01:49:39.430 --> 01:49:43.910]
Oh and I regret its escalation and I apologize.

[01:49:45.830 --> 01:49:46.910]
Thank you Mrs. Smith.

[01:49:49.250 --> 01:49:51.010]
Gentlemen from my always recognize.

[01:49:51.770 --> 01:49:52.550]
But just speaker.

[01:49:53.230 --> 01:49:55.970]
Oh boy and now Mrs. Limbaugh comes down all breathless.

[01:49:56.150 --> 01:49:56.930]
I can't hear that.

[01:50:00.510 --> 01:50:03.630]
She apologizes because they want to hurt the throne of asking jail or something.

[01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:06.450]
For not not for hitting the carpet for bad haircut.

[01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:11.450]
724 you know we actually still got a shot Josh if you would stop just

[01:50:11.450 --> 01:50:14.490]
worrying so much about yourself and what you're going to get 15 bucks an hour.

[01:50:15.310 --> 01:50:17.430]
You'd be lucky to get 15 cent an hour net joint.

[01:50:19.610 --> 01:50:21.090]
You got a lien on these people.

[01:50:21.950 --> 01:50:24.270]
731 we could still do it in spite of Eric.

[01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:27.550]
It seems like you know we're not that I'm paranoid you understand.

[01:50:27.870 --> 01:50:30.330]
But seems like they're after us from every angle every direction.

[01:50:30.590 --> 01:50:33.090]
Even these red answered are calling on my knee where I got the skin.

[01:50:33.610 --> 01:50:33.930]
Oh yeah.

[01:50:35.790 --> 01:50:36.710]
731 that stuff.

[01:50:36.770 --> 01:50:37.550]
Do you think we could do it?

[01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.830]
We could.

[01:50:39.390 --> 01:50:41.970]
Especially if your girlfriend calls back at least two three more times.

[01:50:42.950 --> 01:50:43.790]
WNQAM hello.

[01:50:44.870 --> 01:50:46.670]
Neil I'll take Daniel every time.

[01:50:47.850 --> 01:50:48.710]
WNQAM hello.

[01:50:50.150 --> 01:50:51.010]
QAM hello.

[01:50:52.410 --> 01:50:53.150]
How you doing?

[01:50:53.730 --> 01:50:53.930]
Okay.

[01:50:54.470 --> 01:50:58.730]
Hey I wanted to talk about either if Neil or George has seen the movie What's Up Leap Do We Know.

[01:50:59.590 --> 01:51:05.370]
Try to connect the physics of spirituality and science and what they think they're taking

[01:51:05.370 --> 01:51:11.830]
on a new maybe a new factory was so called non-home man their fascination with females.

[01:51:12.990 --> 01:51:13.930]
I need to get that.

[01:51:14.250 --> 01:51:15.190]
That's a lot of material to go.

[01:51:15.410 --> 01:51:17.390]
Yeah okay we'll write all those down a little bit.

[01:51:17.390 --> 01:51:18.430]
We'll see what Neil and George think about that.

[01:51:18.430 --> 01:51:19.270]
We'll email you back.

[01:51:20.070 --> 01:51:21.330]
We'll think about those.

[01:51:23.630 --> 01:51:25.510]
567 I think he's talking about chicks with.

[01:51:26.470 --> 01:51:26.950]
Right.

[01:51:27.090 --> 01:51:27.190]
Fix.

[01:51:28.870 --> 01:51:32.370]
567 0560 pound 560 and they've arrested in singular wireless line.

[01:51:33.090 --> 01:51:34.690]
744

[01:51:34.690 --> 01:51:34.770]
beat.

[01:51:34.770 --> 01:51:36.690]
全ia

[01:51:42.590 --> 01:51:49.790]
We'll have the

[01:51:56.230 --> 01:52:00.310]
.

[01:52:00.310 --> 01:52:02.350]
air

[01:52:02.350 --> 01:52:02.350]

[01:52:02.350 --> 01:52:02.350]

[01:52:02.350 --> 01:52:02.350]

[01:52:02.350 --> 01:52:02.350]

[01:52:02.350 --> 01:52:02.350]

[01:51:53.950 --> 01:51:56.450]
22

[01:51:56.450 --> 01:51:58.850]
22

[01:51:58.850 --> 01:51:59.250]
23

[01:52:03.910 --> 01:52:04.670]
That's it.

[01:52:09.250 --> 01:52:11.230]
I just want to make an announcement, okay?

[01:52:12.710 --> 01:52:13.490]
Thank God.

[01:52:16.770 --> 01:52:19.330]
The fewer deans I have with women in my life.

[01:52:19.450 --> 01:52:22.670]
I mean, my mother is almost two years now that she sleeps with the fishes, you know?

[01:52:23.410 --> 01:52:25.130]
She took at least ten years off my life.

[01:52:25.410 --> 01:52:27.470]
The greatest kvech and nougin in the history of mankind.

[01:52:28.950 --> 01:52:30.610]
She just could have had one good VM.

[01:52:30.850 --> 01:52:32.890]
Now I got her out of the way and now I got to put up with this.

[01:52:33.130 --> 01:52:33.870]
I commiserate.

[01:52:33.970 --> 01:52:34.370]
I really do.

[01:52:35.070 --> 01:52:38.490]
I really commiserate with all of you heterosexual men feel our pain.

[01:52:38.710 --> 01:52:39.170]
That's just a pity.

[01:52:39.550 --> 01:52:41.370]
The price that you have to pay for little action.

[01:52:41.510 --> 01:52:42.510]
I do mean little usually.

[01:52:44.150 --> 01:52:46.670]
From at its past noon at 5.60 WQM,

[01:52:46.730 --> 01:52:50.050]
what if everything you thought you knew about your home equity turned out not to be true?

[01:52:50.750 --> 01:52:54.470]
What if the most commonly held beliefs about paying down mortgage debt and traditional retirement planning?

[01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:56.330]
We're not giving you the best chance for success.

[01:52:56.630 --> 01:53:04.850]
Tonight, the financial education institute is conducting a free seminar for South Florida homeowners entitled Common Sense Strategies for a successful equity management.

[01:53:05.190 --> 01:53:07.390]
Would you like to learn how to pay off your mortgage in half the time?

[01:53:07.690 --> 01:53:12.550]
Or maybe increase your spendable retirement income by 50% without increasing your current budget today?

[01:53:13.090 --> 01:53:16.410]
Would you like to know what you can do right now to protect yourself from any declining real estate market?

[01:53:16.910 --> 01:53:22.470]
South Florida homeowners are invited to attend this seminar tonight at 6.30 at the Holiday and Boint and Beach.

[01:53:22.470 --> 01:53:24.750]

This is Neil Rogers.

[01:53:43.470 --> 01:53:46.490]
This is 5.60 Q.A.

[01:53:46.490 --> 01:53:46.810]
Thank you.

[01:53:48.890 --> 01:53:49.770]
Thank you.

[01:53:50.330 --> 01:53:51.970]
We came to 7.10.

[01:53:52.410 --> 01:53:54.970]
Hey, my marlins. They kicked me last night.

[01:53:55.130 --> 01:53:57.430]
I'm just here to make you eat your words or up the teeth.

[01:53:57.830 --> 01:54:00.350]
Oh, yeah. You know, I got something for you to eat, Jaggop.

[01:54:00.630 --> 01:54:04.650]
I'll send you a dollar for every game over 70 that the marlins win.

[01:54:04.810 --> 01:54:08.530]
And you send me 50 for every game under and we'll see what kind of a guy you are.

[01:54:08.750 --> 01:54:11.310]
Okay? You on for that stupid eat my words.

[01:54:11.690 --> 01:54:12.210]
Eat this.

[01:54:12.210 --> 01:54:12.830]
Dope.

[01:54:13.050 --> 01:54:14.770]
I have our hand-cold words.

[01:54:14.990 --> 01:54:15.410]
7.10.

[01:54:15.690 --> 01:54:16.790]
Sports radio classes.

[01:54:17.110 --> 01:54:17.910]
Tension A.

[01:54:18.570 --> 01:54:19.090]
Duff.

[01:54:19.270 --> 01:54:20.390]
Get off this instant.

[01:54:20.610 --> 01:54:20.750]
No.

[01:54:21.030 --> 01:54:21.250]
No.

[01:54:23.810 --> 01:54:24.450]
You're fair.

[01:54:24.530 --> 01:54:26.610]
You ready for a bar of August right to handbook?

[01:54:27.230 --> 01:54:29.730]
The lady you were scatting knows I go up.

[01:54:30.330 --> 01:54:32.590]
Apparently she worked with that look at how.

[01:54:33.170 --> 01:54:35.570]
I guess the bunny girl really got around.

[01:54:36.270 --> 01:54:38.710]
She had a ticket from right next to her bed.

[01:54:38.710 --> 01:54:41.790]
She could ride a down-to-sland and donate her hand.

[01:54:42.170 --> 01:54:44.710]
She had a million famous men in her sleep.

[01:54:45.430 --> 01:54:47.890]
From Albus Pressley to Andre Aguisee.

[01:54:48.310 --> 01:54:50.690]
She was the crazy man's another cop ever.

[01:54:51.390 --> 01:54:53.650]
She even had one of the smaller brothers.

[01:54:54.310 --> 01:54:56.850]
I bet she even gave it an infancy cab.

[01:54:57.390 --> 01:54:59.790]
No one could get away from around there.

[01:55:00.330 --> 01:55:05.050]
One year and four of her went out and let us together a shot.

[01:55:06.130 --> 01:55:10.730]
Corner of her and get to have better of this.

[01:55:10.790 --> 01:55:11.890]
Infancy play the plot.

[01:55:12.070 --> 01:55:14.810]
Get surprising since the rep you taste in it as you sing.

[01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:17.890]
They didn't bother collecting the sting of clean.

[01:55:18.630 --> 01:55:20.730]
She must have been a really busy lady.

[01:55:21.550 --> 01:55:23.710]
She even made some darker war in baby.

[01:55:24.610 --> 01:55:27.230]
Her wild days are over since she grew old in.

[01:55:27.710 --> 01:55:29.950]
We're getting pretty charles and Christmas offers then.

[01:55:30.590 --> 01:55:33.010]
They fly with me and my body's all summer and laugh.

[01:55:33.570 --> 01:55:36.110]
We got Maritumans run around there.

[01:55:36.390 --> 01:55:36.790]
Oh, hey.

[01:55:36.810 --> 01:55:37.610]
By the way, answer that.

[01:55:37.990 --> 01:55:40.150]
Oh, I just wanted to put it in the last ending there.

[01:55:40.590 --> 01:55:40.690]
Wow.

[01:55:40.770 --> 01:55:42.350]
The answer to the second part of that guy's question.

[01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:44.130]
I think it's like guys who are into big boobs.

[01:55:46.130 --> 01:55:46.950]
It's the same thing.

[01:55:47.350 --> 01:55:49.330]
And the people are attracted to gigantic organs.

[01:55:49.550 --> 01:55:50.890]
They don't care what they're attached to.

[01:55:51.050 --> 01:55:52.170]
So I see the board and cow.

[01:55:52.490 --> 01:55:53.010]
Fatal one and saying?

[01:55:53.610 --> 01:55:53.810]
No.

[01:55:54.430 --> 01:55:55.150]
Well, he would.

[01:55:55.370 --> 01:55:57.190]
12, 17, and 5, 60, and WDQ.

[01:55:57.290 --> 01:56:00.950]
And maybe we can get that nice lady on again four or five more times before two o'clock.

[01:56:01.090 --> 01:56:01.490]
What do you say?

[01:56:01.490 --> 01:56:02.430]
Don't taunting.

[01:56:02.650 --> 01:56:04.230]
Maybe she can talk to Geltie a little bit.

[01:56:04.410 --> 01:56:04.790]
I beg your pardon?

[01:56:05.390 --> 01:56:06.010]
Don't tempt her.

[01:56:06.270 --> 01:56:06.990]
No, it's an invitation.

[01:56:07.070 --> 01:56:07.530]
Come on.

[01:56:07.610 --> 01:56:08.250]
Let's see if he can do it.

[01:56:08.310 --> 01:56:11.070]
I'm sure she can because she's getting right through over and over again.

[01:56:11.190 --> 01:56:12.570]
And if she does, you know, send a picture.

[01:56:12.590 --> 01:56:13.810]
I like to deliver it to the house.

[01:56:14.210 --> 01:56:15.050]
Yeah, deliver this.

[01:56:15.510 --> 01:56:16.890]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.

[01:56:17.750 --> 01:56:20.230]
Pound 5, 60 and leave a rise in singular right-ass lines.

[01:56:21.450 --> 01:56:22.930]
WDQ, way MCD, repair line.

[01:56:23.050 --> 01:56:23.170]
Hello.

[01:56:24.270 --> 01:56:25.710]
Hey, I know how you doing.

[01:56:25.950 --> 01:56:26.230]
Okay.

[01:56:26.750 --> 01:56:27.530]
Good to see you.

[01:56:27.630 --> 01:56:28.470]
Good to hear from you.

[01:56:29.270 --> 01:56:31.150]
Good to see you too, Aziz and Paisa.

[01:56:32.430 --> 01:56:42.730]
You know, getting into that stadium situation, the Yankees will knock down Yankees stadium and build the new stadium.

[01:56:43.230 --> 01:56:44.610]
Yeah, what are the owners?

[01:56:44.730 --> 01:56:46.870]
Well, the owner is going to pay for it.

[01:56:46.890 --> 01:56:47.030]
Yeah.

[01:56:47.150 --> 01:56:47.730]
Oh, wow.

[01:56:48.250 --> 01:56:50.370]
Us guys, Hank Tyke and Lickley.

[01:56:51.370 --> 01:56:51.770]
Okay.

[01:56:51.850 --> 01:56:52.310]
Good luck to you.

[01:56:52.330 --> 01:56:52.850]
Whatever you said.

[01:56:53.190 --> 01:56:54.870]
I know a sun settle trick a poll on it.

[01:56:54.990 --> 01:56:57.450]
Is this morning they're doing that or was it yesterday and time flies?

[01:56:59.090 --> 01:57:01.190]
And, uh, Marlins have lost a lot of fans.

[01:57:01.310 --> 01:57:02.950]
You've faced a lot of people often chase them away.

[01:57:03.050 --> 01:57:04.890]
I'm pretty sure it's this morning, Suns settle.

[01:57:05.450 --> 01:57:08.290]
I'm going to take a few-catter right now, as a matter of fact, if that thing pops up,

[01:57:08.410 --> 01:57:11.370]
what their website gives you real, don't go on a Suns settle website.

[01:57:11.430 --> 01:57:13.310]
You'll get some horrible disease if you do.

[01:57:13.990 --> 01:57:17.130]
You'll get very, very, very, very sick.

[01:57:17.810 --> 01:57:18.430]
Oh, there it is.

[01:57:18.570 --> 01:57:22.830]
Now, let's see if that poll, uh-oh, Cuban Chute 2, killing 1 in migrants smuggling attempting to do

[01:57:22.830 --> 01:57:23.830]
the Epinar del Rio.

[01:57:24.810 --> 01:57:29.110]
The Cuban Coast Guard shot two suspected migrants smugglers from the United States killing 1

[01:57:29.830 --> 01:57:34.130]
when they, uh, they and a third man refused orders to halt their speedboat as it near the island.

[01:57:36.450 --> 01:57:39.710]
Death sentence handed down in stomping murder of Hollywood retiree.

[01:57:39.830 --> 01:57:45.010]
Gabby Tennis was sentenced to death on, uh, today for the stomping murder of 91-year-old disabled

[01:57:45.010 --> 01:57:46.250]
war veteran in his Hollywood home.

[01:57:46.530 --> 01:57:46.750]
Good.

[01:57:47.670 --> 01:57:50.430]
Now, let's see, where's that poll about the, uh, Marlins?

[01:57:50.430 --> 01:57:50.890]
You got it?

[01:57:51.110 --> 01:57:52.290]
No, they took it off already.

[01:57:52.450 --> 01:57:53.210]
They changed it.

[01:57:53.610 --> 01:57:56.810]
Yeah, they were a second wind as they were doing, taking it really, uh, bad news.

[01:57:56.970 --> 01:57:59.690]
A lot of people, of course, a whole bunch of people didn't care about in the first place,

[01:58:00.350 --> 01:58:00.910]
like me.

[01:58:01.810 --> 01:58:03.250]
A lot of people ain't going no more.

[01:58:03.370 --> 01:58:04.610]
They're cutting way down in the games.

[01:58:04.810 --> 01:58:06.050]
They're just going to stop going all together.

[01:58:06.370 --> 01:58:07.050]
You can't put it in.

[01:58:07.050 --> 01:58:09.390]
I know they, they scored a lot of runs out there in that series.

[01:58:09.550 --> 01:58:09.830]
Big deal.

[01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:12.710]
They still lost two out of three games and everybody in their brother's sand.

[01:58:13.030 --> 01:58:14.210]
They're going to lose a hundred games in series.

[01:58:14.210 --> 01:58:16.550]
Now, with the Scuttlebottes, Jack, that's what they're saying.

[01:58:16.830 --> 01:58:17.710]
That's what they're all saying.

[01:58:19.550 --> 01:58:24.450]
Because the public has had the carpet pulled the flying carpet pulled out from them too many times already.

[01:58:24.950 --> 01:58:28.270]
And you know how the Arab street gets pissed off when you pull the flying carpet out from their feet?

[01:58:29.030 --> 01:58:31.670]
Just when they were about to like bend over and sniff the guy in the...

[01:58:31.670 --> 01:58:32.610]
Break down in front of him.

[01:58:33.570 --> 01:58:35.870]
I just don't know how the hell they do that, yeah.

[01:58:37.350 --> 01:58:39.350]
All the real religious men and nuts.

[01:58:39.510 --> 01:58:40.950]
You just, you watch them, what they're doing.

[01:58:41.090 --> 01:58:42.510]
You just think, well, what is this?

[01:58:42.590 --> 01:58:44.770]
How could anybody keep convinced to do such crap?

[01:58:44.930 --> 01:58:46.070]
Oh, that's what God wants you to do.

[01:58:46.070 --> 01:58:46.990]
Or is that what it is?

[01:58:47.010 --> 01:58:47.370]
Yeah.

[01:58:47.490 --> 01:58:48.090]
What about Allah?

[01:58:48.590 --> 01:58:49.110]
Him too.

[01:58:50.290 --> 01:58:50.950]
WQAM, hello.

[01:58:51.230 --> 01:58:52.070]
All of it.

[01:58:53.390 --> 01:58:54.050]
WQAM, hello.

[01:58:55.850 --> 01:58:56.710]
We're rolling it.

[01:58:56.770 --> 01:58:57.430]
She'll get back in.

[01:58:57.930 --> 01:58:58.630]
WQAM, hello.

[01:58:59.330 --> 01:59:00.970]
Can you put some more of that Mumble music?

[01:59:02.210 --> 01:59:02.970]
567-0560.

[01:59:03.130 --> 01:59:03.950]
It's see that cruise music.

[01:59:04.070 --> 01:59:04.390]
Cut the crap.

[01:59:04.750 --> 01:59:05.430]
Mumble my ass.

[01:59:06.610 --> 01:59:07.450]
I think that's the name of it.

[01:59:08.450 --> 01:59:09.110]
WQAM, hello.

[01:59:11.850 --> 01:59:12.230]
QAM.

[01:59:14.770 --> 01:59:15.150]
QAM.

[01:59:15.150 --> 01:59:15.350]
Good.

[01:59:15.450 --> 01:59:15.510]
Yeah.

[01:59:15.850 --> 01:59:16.630]
Question about how long.

[01:59:17.130 --> 01:59:17.330]
How long?

[01:59:17.330 --> 01:59:17.330]

[01:59:17.610 --> 01:59:17.610]

[01:59:18.850 --> 01:59:19.550]
WQAM, hello.

[01:59:19.810 --> 01:59:20.490]
I'll give it up.

[01:59:23.630 --> 01:59:24.030]
No.

[01:59:24.130 --> 01:59:24.210]
No way.

[01:59:24.310 --> 01:59:24.770]
It's through charge.

[01:59:25.150 --> 01:59:25.770]
All right.

[01:59:26.550 --> 01:59:28.630]
And our last one, WQAM, hello.

[01:59:29.050 --> 01:59:29.750]
Rumping out.

[01:59:29.890 --> 01:59:29.990]
Hello.

[01:59:30.170 --> 01:59:30.530]
He's huge.

[01:59:31.870 --> 01:59:32.670]
567-0560.

[01:59:33.110 --> 01:59:33.470]
Come on.

[01:59:33.470 --> 01:59:33.850]
Come on.

[01:59:33.850 --> 01:59:34.810]
Let me get back to my pile.

[01:59:35.010 --> 01:59:35.130]
Okay.

[01:59:35.330 --> 01:59:37.250]
I thought this might work today, but it ain't going to happen.

[01:59:37.330 --> 01:59:37.550]
Really?

[01:59:37.730 --> 01:59:38.310]
What did you think that?

[01:59:38.810 --> 01:59:39.290]
Well, why not.

[01:59:39.510 --> 01:59:39.510]

[01:59:39.750 --> 01:59:42.010]

You never been to be ever been to the afterbred to the flats

[02:11:59.210 --> 02:12:03.910]
Talking on me or don't either one of you. I've been to each one once we've been through this

[02:12:05.070 --> 02:12:06.210]
Yeah, Gulf Stream

[02:12:06.970 --> 02:12:07.390]
Calder

[02:12:08.350 --> 02:12:11.190]
How about a hockey game popular in the several hockey

[02:12:13.010 --> 02:12:18.330]
I'm a part of the necessarily hockey games really have you free tickets of course. Oh, okay. I'm going Sunday

[02:12:18.910 --> 02:12:22.170]
You're going Sunday or what to the panther panther in the lightning type of it

[02:12:22.170 --> 02:12:24.610]
That could be a big game. All the way down to panthers. You dead as a door nail

[02:12:25.690 --> 02:12:29.510]
They're did done, but so there's no pressure that's good. Why are you going on Sunday? You get free tickets?

[02:12:29.810 --> 02:12:32.670]
Of course I do and then once the other reason is gotta be an ulterior

[02:12:32.670 --> 02:12:35.050]
There's some family in town figure we go to the panther game

[02:12:35.050 --> 02:12:39.410]
Yeah, that's a good way to kill a day and get their ass out of the way and that's good

[02:12:40.090 --> 02:12:45.010]
Anytime those pennies roll those come in taking this some ball games hockey games or something kill a few hours

[02:12:45.010 --> 02:12:49.910]
Then they'll get their ass out of there quick and then they announce oh, well guess what we're staying for 12 days

[02:12:49.910 --> 02:12:51.610]
And you say that's what you think

[02:12:52.730 --> 02:12:57.010]
And then the neighbor across the street comes over and starts giving a religious track leaving him on the doorstep

[02:12:59.050 --> 02:12:59.470]
5670560

[02:13:00.230 --> 02:13:07.210]
At least you don't have a brother called Coca-Cola classic anyway. I'll five sixty-end of a ride and sing it a wireless line. Oh, God

[02:13:08.190 --> 02:13:08.930]

[02:13:24.390 --> 02:13:26.170]
Congratulations on your 30 years

[02:13:26.170 --> 02:13:28.790]
Uh on the radio. I've enjoyed your program

[02:13:29.390 --> 02:13:34.030]
I also want to call tell you about the green field pasta. I really enjoyed it

[02:13:34.030 --> 02:13:39.610]
I'm not a diapetic, but I really enjoyed it. You don't have to be diabetic or Jewish to enjoy green field pasta

[02:13:40.110 --> 02:13:40.830]
Yeah, I know that

[02:13:41.450 --> 02:13:41.930]
also

[02:13:42.490 --> 02:13:42.810]
I

[02:13:44.250 --> 02:13:50.530]
Let a couple of my diabetic friends know about it and all of us want to thank you for letting us know about this great product

[02:13:51.390 --> 02:13:52.730]
Excellent keep up the good word

[02:13:53.970 --> 02:13:57.750]
Okay, thanks to Wayne, but that sounded like a commercial to me. That's not what you're doing boy

[02:13:57.750 --> 02:14:01.850]
You're looking at all the money you're gonna be a product. Yeah. Hey, oh, that's right. I forgot about that

[02:14:01.850 --> 02:14:04.710]
When you were in about 58 bucks, how do you got that big check coming from him?

[02:14:04.890 --> 02:14:09.110]
That's right. Maybe at least some pasta. Oh, you dig in your pasta. What you paid for yes, I did get a case

[02:14:09.110 --> 02:14:11.770]
I did I have a case. I got a case

[02:14:11.930 --> 02:14:15.590]
I'm thinking I'm getting them elbows making that macaroni's and cheese. Mm-hmm

[02:14:15.590 --> 02:14:20.530]
So you hadn't realized they got a caveat that that's a good point is that they now sell in the sauce section

[02:14:21.050 --> 02:14:22.150]
feel like a little sauce

[02:14:22.970 --> 02:14:29.130]
They sell like it probably I don't know cheese in the job. I have cheese in a jar. That's a good way to describe it right

[02:14:29.830 --> 02:14:30.570]
Jesus Christ

[02:14:31.450 --> 02:14:39.430]
So us and I don't think I've ever seen that have you seen it what he saw cheese in a jar. Yeah, you have

[02:14:39.930 --> 02:14:44.550]
Oh, it's in the the Alfredo cheese the Alfredo sauce. I'm not talking about that

[02:14:45.090 --> 02:14:48.450]
Alfredo sauce is not the cheese. It's got cheese in it, right

[02:14:49.550 --> 02:14:55.530]
Cream, but they're not talking about that. That's not the kind of so I'm sure they knew me. I'm sure the macaroni's you got like velvita

[02:14:55.530 --> 02:14:59.310]
Right melted just melted in a little crap product

[02:15:00.070 --> 02:15:05.510]
What I like to believe I'm just talking about when you're horny for that kind of like really nasty stuff

[02:15:06.970 --> 02:15:07.930]
20-21 gee

[02:15:07.930 --> 02:15:13.110]
I don't want to keep taking calls. Let's not do any more breaks. Of course with this new sales department. I think we got to worry about that too much

[02:15:14.090 --> 02:15:15.090]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:15:16.190 --> 02:15:20.650]
We got we got we got the clown and the uh and the Yahoo man

[02:15:21.590 --> 02:15:27.450]
Got a couple of clowns these guys are real now that's he like go go go fall when he's in that because I can't really see him christian

[02:15:28.130 --> 02:15:32.750]
You go push all and go fall when he says stuff for just sliding stuff on the side of the knee haven't noticed

[02:15:32.750 --> 02:15:39.410]
But I'll they get a part. Yeah, watch it next time when it comes in there feed me a lot of crap. Let me look at my knee. Oh look at that

[02:15:39.410 --> 02:15:39.910]
Whoo

[02:15:40.470 --> 02:15:46.030]
The bleeding is just about stopped okay because I skinted this and my new Roger

[02:15:47.130 --> 02:15:49.850]
This is 5168

[02:15:52.970 --> 02:15:54.510]
Howard David's a bitch

[02:15:55.270 --> 02:16:02.450]
Having a bladder control problem is standing up what makes it worse is the constant worrying the worry that your problem is as obvious as

[02:16:02.450 --> 02:16:03.730]
You'd announced it to the world

[02:16:05.210 --> 02:16:07.170]
Is this like working?

[02:16:07.930 --> 02:16:10.070]
Yeah, I got a bladder problem

[02:16:14.410 --> 02:16:16.770]
Overactive bladder is a real medical condition

[02:16:24.310 --> 02:16:27.170]
Detrol LA helps keeping overactive bladder

[02:16:27.170 --> 02:16:30.830]
Oh speaking about all these religious man look at this just in

[02:16:30.830 --> 02:16:33.630]
I'm trying to print it out, but if the Sun sent us for probably won't print oh

[02:16:34.830 --> 02:16:36.590]
Well eventually for the show be over by that

[02:16:37.830 --> 02:16:42.110]
Ancient manuscript may shed light on relationship between Jesus and Judas oh

[02:16:43.050 --> 02:16:44.570]
No, you think Jesus was Judas

[02:16:46.010 --> 02:16:54.790]
And ancient manuscript read we discovered after 1700 years May shed new light on the relationship between Jesus and Judas to disciple of be trade him

[02:16:55.950 --> 02:16:57.870]
Remember Judas he was kind of like Joe Bell

[02:16:58.970 --> 02:17:03.390]
Rather than the traitor as Judas is portrayed in the New Testament this document the gospel of Judas

[02:17:03.390 --> 02:17:09.430]
Indicates the act of the request of Jesus to help him shed his earthly body see he was just helping out of the whole thing go on

[02:17:09.430 --> 02:17:13.990]
That's all I mean this was the plan right where this God's plan that was the plan well

[02:17:13.990 --> 02:17:17.250]
He was just being the facilitator man and you're picking on poor Judas

[02:17:18.810 --> 02:17:24.190]
Let a vigorous debate on the significance of this fascinating ancient text begin the Reverend Donald Sr

[02:17:24.690 --> 02:17:27.190]
Presumably Catholic theodical union of Chicago say today

[02:17:27.690 --> 02:17:29.390]
I wonder if he's getting a Joe Mars senior

[02:17:30.930 --> 02:17:33.110]
Senior or maybe to Sandra Fisher

[02:17:33.970 --> 02:17:39.030]
Senior expressed out that the new gospel will arrive in the New Testament, but allow that opinions are likely to differ on it

[02:17:40.090 --> 02:17:44.090]
The text helps you the diversity of beliefs and early Christianity added Marvin Meyer

[02:17:44.690 --> 02:17:50.350]
I wonder if he's keen to ask her Marvin Meyer professor of Bible studies at Chapin University, New Orleans, California

[02:17:51.070 --> 02:17:52.470]
What if he's kind of Chuck Meyer

[02:17:53.090 --> 02:17:56.950]
Oh those phoneers man those interviews with the best what a show. Yeah a lot of work went into that

[02:17:56.950 --> 02:18:02.390]
Elaine Pagel's a professor religion at Princeton University commented that the people who loved circulated and wrote down these

[02:18:02.390 --> 02:18:04.730]
Gospels didn't think that they were heretics

[02:18:05.490 --> 02:18:12.310]
See we just they just kept the story they just kept changing them and making them the paparous manuscript papyrus

[02:18:12.310 --> 02:18:19.570]
Give her right on papyrus onion skin just this Lord. Oh, God probably written around 300 AD and Coptic script

[02:18:20.130 --> 02:18:26.610]
Is the copy of an earlier Greek manuscript said Terry Garcia of the National Geographic Society who made the manuscript cubic

[02:18:27.150 --> 02:18:32.790]
It was discovered in the desert in Egypt in 1970s has now been authenticated by carbon dating and studied and most

[02:18:32.790 --> 02:18:34.850]
translated by biblical scholars

[02:18:34.850 --> 02:18:36.150]
bunch of getch keys

[02:18:36.150 --> 02:18:42.490]
Unlike the four gospels of the Bible the latest text indicates that Judas betrayed Jesus and his Jesus request

[02:18:43.490 --> 02:18:48.550]
The text begins the secret account of the revelation that Jesus spoke in conversation with Judas is scary it

[02:18:48.550 --> 02:18:49.470]
Schwartz

[02:18:50.990 --> 02:18:53.190]
The key passage comes when Judas tells

[02:18:53.190 --> 02:18:58.950]
J. Jesus tells Judas you will exceed all of them for you will sacrifice the man that closed me

[02:18:59.510 --> 02:19:05.350]
What this indicates the Judas would help them write these spiritual self by helping Jesus give it a bit of his physical flesh

[02:19:05.350 --> 02:19:07.090]
Sounds like a bunch of crazy people to me

[02:19:08.490 --> 02:19:12.950]
Sounds like a bunch of bubble my season. He talked about crazy people. Oh man. Wait to hear this

[02:19:13.630 --> 02:19:17.270]
Oh my god, you thought that the last FCC chairman was bad

[02:19:18.090 --> 02:19:18.670]
Whoo

[02:19:20.230 --> 02:19:24.610]
In a message that undoubtedly warmed the hearts of large media concerns such as Tribune Company

[02:19:24.610 --> 02:19:26.750]
GANET Company and Media General

[02:19:27.510 --> 02:19:27.770]
and

[02:19:27.770 --> 02:19:29.530]
Teap channel and the all the others

[02:19:29.530 --> 02:19:36.990]
FCC Commission chairman Kevin Martin delivered a sharp critique of regulations providing newspaper publishers from owning TV stations in the same markets

[02:19:36.990 --> 02:19:42.030]
And pleaded with other publishers to lobby more vigorously for its repeal at age reports today

[02:19:43.250 --> 02:19:50.050]
Mr. Martin the Republican who replaced the crazy Michael Powell is chairmanized march was already on market as an opponent of the cross ownership rule

[02:19:50.050 --> 02:19:51.210]
How about cross-dressing

[02:19:52.490 --> 02:19:53.550]
His it sounds a little

[02:19:53.550 --> 02:19:59.130]
But the sharp language used today suggests it's demise or released the latest push for it may be imminent

[02:20:01.010 --> 02:20:06.150]
Imminent now what we're talking about illegal immanence is in comments to the newspaper association of America

[02:20:06.150 --> 02:20:12.650]
Mr. Martin the right of the 26 year old rule as an outdated product of an era pre see this is great because now we can have like Fox

[02:20:12.650 --> 02:20:18.870]
Can all the newspapers and all the TV stations they can all be ultra right-wing. I don't keep it simple. You can get teeth over them off the air

[02:20:18.870 --> 02:20:19.750]
Lou dobs

[02:20:23.090 --> 02:20:27.190]
Yeah, I don't know I'm sure you have because you're watching Lou dobs now. We should apologize for that

[02:20:27.190 --> 02:20:32.690]
But yeah, if there's anybody more pedantic or more embarrassing than then we'll flip screen on here

[02:20:32.690 --> 02:20:34.790]
I can't imagine oh yeah before and after

[02:20:34.790 --> 02:20:37.170]
In the situation room with

[02:20:37.170 --> 02:20:41.190]
Well, let's create and now we're gonna go to Jack cavernty

[02:20:41.190 --> 02:20:46.630]
I mean here's that cavity. He was just ripping everybody and asking about a sincere humor and release sarcastic and you know

[02:20:46.630 --> 02:20:52.070]
And we go back to wolf. Oh, thank you Jack. We'll be back at the seven o'clock in the situation room

[02:20:52.070 --> 02:20:55.190]
And thank you for being with us here in this situation room

[02:20:55.890 --> 02:20:56.730]
Jesus God

[02:20:57.350 --> 02:21:01.110]
Oh you people if you pay any attention to media they'll put you in a rubber room pretty soon

[02:21:01.110 --> 02:21:03.790]
I'm telling you no wonder nobody watches the freaking news. I don't blame you

[02:21:04.370 --> 02:21:09.690]
I rather watch that sir that surfboarding movie with Amel Hersh again. I'm kind of I'm not the

[02:21:10.350 --> 02:21:14.250]
I'm not all in thrilled with him anymore. He's got issues. What do you do to you?

[02:21:14.830 --> 02:21:16.210]
Nothing yet. He's got issues

[02:21:18.310 --> 02:21:23.070]
824 votes. Oh, we're gonna do it Josh and what I'm gonna get him a fat new deal

[02:21:23.070 --> 02:21:26.270]
This is the whole whole thing is hinging and if we can get to a thousand votes

[02:21:26.270 --> 02:21:30.590]
George and Josh's new deals even if the RSA new deal like these guys are gunning for

[02:21:31.230 --> 02:21:32.330]
They're gunning for it

[02:21:34.590 --> 02:21:36.990]
If we can get the thousand votes, I think you guys are in

[02:21:37.630 --> 02:21:39.030]
If not you're screwed

[02:21:40.530 --> 02:21:45.670]
824, I mean we'll have like probably at least 850 by the top of the hour. We can we can do it. We can do it

[02:21:45.670 --> 02:21:48.090]
You folks can do it hop on at baby

[02:21:48.570 --> 02:21:50.650]
Punch it bang it squeeze it

[02:21:51.810 --> 02:21:52.210]
Right

[02:21:53.250 --> 02:21:59.070]
Vote over and over again. I mean just like that broad to call how many times she called about third man to a CD repair

[02:22:00.490 --> 02:22:04.650]
5 6 7 0 5 yeah that call about the apostasy of a very suspicious to me

[02:22:05.550 --> 02:22:07.230]
Dominic you weigh in hello

[02:22:07.230 --> 02:22:13.330]
Nail this uh Jesus and Judah story isn't that the first case then of uh assisted suicide?

[02:22:15.550 --> 02:22:21.510]
The first why the first case of assisted suicide? I said yeah doctor jack would be very proud a good point

[02:22:22.110 --> 02:22:27.330]
That's that that Terry Shiloh thing good thinking maybe he disconnected Jesus is you that could have been in

[02:22:27.330 --> 02:22:33.090]
That right you I wonder what our fat fat ass governor what that about that thank god thank the lord that he wasn't around then

[02:22:33.790 --> 02:22:37.890]
Because Jesus may have never been able to save mankind and I've solved you from all your sins

[02:22:39.190 --> 02:22:39.550]
Right

[02:22:40.270 --> 02:22:42.810]
He gave his only begotten son so that uh

[02:22:42.810 --> 02:22:49.170]
Glam could make a big business and that what it says in the Bible that's what it says is only begotten son as opposed to a foregotten

[02:22:50.830 --> 02:22:54.730]
You know that the kid that they're making the big simmiss about so the first thing that it was kill the father

[02:22:54.730 --> 02:22:59.530]
Just shoot him right on TV that that's the first thing right and then the mother I'm wondering what else you was thinking about

[02:23:01.690 --> 02:23:05.830]
Well, you know the kids spent a lot of time locked in his bedroom, which I'm sure he's not the only one doing and of course

[02:23:05.830 --> 02:23:10.050]
She she probably had some idea what he was doing in there. She just realized there were a lot of people watching

[02:23:11.210 --> 02:23:15.930]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 and they've arrived in singular wireless line

[02:23:15.930 --> 02:23:20.130]
It's just uh, you know the idea that everybody should be making babies that's another that's another

[02:23:20.130 --> 02:23:25.910]
Just lunacy of this planet that we live on not everybody's apparent. You know what I'm saying apparently

[02:23:26.390 --> 02:23:31.330]
Yeah, I believe me. I know from oh you know experience. Oh do I ever know and you know

[02:26:09.390 --> 02:26:14.730]
Hey, Neil. I was wondering if you know anything about this uh, I saw on the TV. I was at work

[02:26:14.730 --> 02:26:19.370]
I didn't get to see the whole story, but there was like a bunch of these against orthodox Jews

[02:26:20.970 --> 02:26:21.770]
writing somewhere

[02:26:22.410 --> 02:26:27.150]
Do you know why they're writing on the street like I'm setting fire

[02:26:27.150 --> 02:26:29.210]
And in Brooklyn I saw that there

[02:26:29.210 --> 02:26:34.910]
Uh, I have an nervous breakdown right what was that about and about the Jews hating Jews

[02:26:36.530 --> 02:26:40.190]
I thought it was a movie. I thought it was fake when I saw it

[02:26:40.190 --> 02:26:45.550]
No, it's real man. It's real uh cycle all right, so but it's just just

[02:26:46.430 --> 02:26:49.670]
What's exactly for me just Jews against Jews for what's happening?

[02:26:51.450 --> 02:26:56.630]
I would I put this way s.o.c. same old crap same old crap to go on for a long time

[02:26:56.630 --> 02:27:00.630]
There are gods better than ours. They're uh, you know, it's paysock man. It's holiday time

[02:27:00.630 --> 02:27:04.050]
They're probably arguing about who's gonna bring the wine to satyr. Is that what it is?

[02:27:04.190 --> 02:27:08.110]
Is it gonna be moving David or man of shavids? My wine's better than your wine or even a

[02:27:09.250 --> 02:27:12.550]
Chitoli right in hell castle hoist that kind of stuff. Yeah, I just get with it

[02:27:13.290 --> 02:27:16.510]
I saw the story on it this morning. I didn't even bother a waste of my time with that

[02:27:16.510 --> 02:27:17.970]
I mean, it's just the same old crap

[02:27:17.970 --> 02:27:22.110]
The silly guys with the big hats and those long beards who are living like in a there

[02:27:22.110 --> 02:27:25.330]
It's somebody telling them that they turned a calendar. You know the calendar keeps changing

[02:27:25.330 --> 02:27:30.890]
Not only did we turn a clock ahead we keep changing the calendar too even the Jewish calendar moves are forward ledged allegedly

[02:27:30.890 --> 02:27:31.550]
But not for them

[02:27:34.470 --> 02:27:38.730]
Getskis baby. That's what we're dealing with too many Getskis in the world all the religion is put them on Uranus

[02:27:38.730 --> 02:27:43.230]
That's what I say sediment out of space put them on a big space show all the religious nuts of all shapes

[02:27:43.730 --> 02:27:48.770]
Stripes varieties the Muslims the Jews the goyema all of them the Buddhists

[02:27:50.770 --> 02:27:55.150]
Oh, you know, I told you and I've was a year ago or two years ago when the Adali Lamma was here in

[02:27:55.330 --> 02:27:55.570]
Toronto

[02:27:57.270 --> 02:28:00.970]
Onto rise they all were there they all wear they all dressed the same way they got the shaved heads

[02:28:00.970 --> 02:28:05.450]
Which I am a little bit late for that I guess and they all had the purple outfits on you know you you see them

[02:28:05.450 --> 02:28:10.750]
But that they were orange no, no, I don't think so. I think they were purple. They all look like they were in a purple haze

[02:28:10.750 --> 02:28:12.830]
They were smoking some pretty heavy duty crap

[02:28:14.890 --> 02:28:16.830]
You have to smoke heavy in fact

[02:28:16.830 --> 02:28:21.690]
I'm surprised you got out of religion because with all the crap you smoke and you got to to be ready for that curve

[02:28:22.670 --> 02:28:25.110]
No, so Judas was a good guy

[02:28:25.110 --> 02:28:31.770]
We're just finding this out all these years later Judas was a good guy. He was the enabler. He made Jesus early yesterday

[02:28:32.530 --> 02:28:37.510]
The head of a big corrupt bubble-mice institution making big big tax exempt bucks

[02:28:37.950 --> 02:28:42.850]
All of these still have you talk about snappy dresses, yeah, maybe they could use a little help in the wardrobe department

[02:28:42.850 --> 02:28:43.290]
Do you think?

[02:28:44.030 --> 02:28:50.510]
But yeah, if you if you could have been with me that day in Rome a few years ago, and I told you about that store where they say it was a a

[02:28:52.470 --> 02:28:58.270]
Church garment store. I don't know the way to describe it. Okay, and in the winter they had all these beautiful

[02:28:58.270 --> 02:28:59.070]
Ligious garb

[02:28:59.730 --> 02:29:06.290]
Exactly. That's what it was. It was a religious garb store all these velvet chachkis and oh my god

[02:29:06.290 --> 02:29:11.970]
They picked me up a priest outfit. Okay next time Halloween's coming up next time. We'll be bringing more of them a switch guard outfit

[02:29:11.970 --> 02:29:13.790]
I think I'm wearing it all over. There's a look at the road

[02:29:13.790 --> 02:29:15.210]

Do you know what?

[02:32:47.880 --> 02:32:51.940]
Since we just got through a plane I think about Jesus and he's a Jew and all other crap and about Judah

[02:32:51.940 --> 02:32:53.100]
Didn't he say he's a Judas?

[02:32:53.800 --> 02:32:55.760]
Yeah, or he's a Jewess big those Judas

[02:32:56.180 --> 02:32:58.080]
Jewess makes it sound a little

[02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:04.520]
Oh, and I look at us just now they put it on CNN let me testify that the Bush authorized the leak

[02:33:04.520 --> 02:33:09.800]
Well, we had that on at least an hour ago, right? Right? At least breaking news on the near Roger show

[02:33:09.800 --> 02:33:14.860]
Okay, how come that's why we're so newsy man because we we beat everybody just beat the pants off CNN you idiots

[02:33:18.080 --> 02:33:22.100]
And I'm sure it was on the smircling chimpy the way let's give them credit even though they don't give me any

[02:33:22.100 --> 02:33:26.260]
Oh no, and this didn't print out it printed out with that banner over the top of the article

[02:33:26.900 --> 02:33:33.760]
Don't you hate that you know I mean by that yeah, and I hate it the ad prints out anyway. I'll read it off the thing

[02:33:33.760 --> 02:33:38.800]
We need to get the MIPD's highest ranking on a uniform cop student side of Brooklyn station station

[02:33:38.800 --> 02:33:44.340]
I was screaming get the f-ing Jews out of here. I want a heads rolling a city councilman charge yesterday

[02:33:46.500 --> 02:33:48.980]
Chief of the department Joseph Espo said

[02:33:49.620 --> 02:33:50.240]
He shouted

[02:33:51.180 --> 02:33:52.020]
The slur

[02:33:52.600 --> 02:33:56.860]
Say I can barely read this it's true. Let me okay here. Yeah, you're slurring

[02:33:57.940 --> 02:34:02.760]
Joseph Espozino shouted the slur as cops in riot gear struggle with hundreds of young Hacidim

[02:34:02.760 --> 02:34:08.860]
rampaging throughout Burrow Park setting fires and smashing windows to the United the protested rest of an elderly orthodox Jew

[02:34:09.540 --> 02:34:12.400]
Councilman Simhaw Felder said it was a Simhaw not

[02:34:13.320 --> 02:34:18.120]
Espozino then turned to Felderon said Simhaw if you don't want to help me get the f out of here the councilman claimed

[02:34:19.220 --> 02:34:24.760]
But the city while acknowledging Espozino ordered vulgarities in the heat of the moment denied he was in the ethnical religious slurs

[02:34:24.760 --> 02:34:30.800]
quoting with Chafasang as saying get these f-ing people out of here as opposed to f-ing Jews, okay

[02:34:31.760 --> 02:34:37.540]
Felder was said he's known as Pzeuot 55 since the cop was appointed commander of the Burrow Park precinct and had the highest

[02:34:37.540 --> 02:34:38.860]
Yadi Yadi regard

[02:34:39.460 --> 02:34:45.540]
He added remark he made about Jews could have made about blacks Hispanics about anybody else. It's an excuseable filter said

[02:34:45.540 --> 02:34:49.920]
When used the word Jew with the f-ing in any fashion something is seriously wrong

[02:34:50.380 --> 02:34:53.260]
What should be done? I'll leave that to the mayor and the police commissioner

[02:34:53.260 --> 02:34:56.200]
Please commissioner make Kelly acknowledge us be Zito use of vulgarity

[02:34:56.200 --> 02:35:02.200]
But offered support to his imbecile big deal okay big simm it should be a worse problem. Okay, so I cut the crap

[02:35:04.900 --> 02:35:07.300]
Don't care about words the big air everybody's so offtight

[02:35:07.300 --> 02:35:13.020]
And so it's an ethics like that bitch here what that who apologizes find that that Georgia bitch that's right

[02:35:13.820 --> 02:35:16.460]
Same thing the woman with a really freaky hairdo

[02:35:17.340 --> 02:35:19.020]
But air scooter liby look at that

[02:35:19.780 --> 02:35:25.120]
This is old news Jeffrey tube and big simmiss there on CNN like all of us and they just discovered it

[02:35:25.660 --> 02:35:30.240]

[02:35:38.700 --> 02:35:44.980]

[02:35:45.860 --> 02:35:47.620]

[02:37:24.040 --> 02:37:25.240]
Good morning America

[02:37:26.220 --> 02:37:30.520]
Today what's what's the other one? What's the one on CBS this morning that nobody watches?

[02:37:30.520 --> 02:37:33.460]
No, at least nobody would admit it poor Harry Smith

[02:37:47.340 --> 02:37:51.680]
Oh, it was it was it the other I could always Diaz-Valart first. He did got a crappy theme song

[02:37:52.920 --> 02:37:58.180]
But I told you he was gonna bomb. He's he's got a person out like a dead man that Diaz-Valart

[02:37:58.180 --> 02:37:59.920]

We can have like a regular segment with her car. We could drag that on for months

[02:38:37.160 --> 02:38:40.920]
They can take up office pools to see how many times she's gonna call in in the given day

[02:38:41.440 --> 02:38:45.420]
See we told her what to do and where to go, but she won't listen to us. She doesn't really care

[02:38:45.420 --> 02:38:49.100]
She's like most women. She won't listen. No matter what she's telling her she won't listen

[02:38:49.100 --> 02:38:52.020]

All these things. Yeah, you said it. I'm put another abandon in my knee.

All right, a new change changes. I've practically...

[02:45:12.010 --> 02:45:14.490]
You're a new program. Huh? More absorbency. No, I just...

[02:45:15.150 --> 02:45:19.190]
It just stops off of the blood because I take that plavix, you know, so I don't have another beastly stroke.

[02:45:21.770 --> 02:45:25.390]
See, I never realized there was that much blood on your knee. See, they're different body parts.

[02:45:25.570 --> 02:45:28.230]
I never realized how much blood. I mean, there's something that's pretty obvious, you know.

[02:45:30.210 --> 02:45:34.510]
That they're in gorge with blood. Oh, speaking of in gorge with blood body parts, there's Rob Marciano and CNN.

[02:45:36.530 --> 02:45:40.490]
Let's keep looking for that one story. I can't find it. Oh, five, six, seven, oh, five, six, eight.

[02:45:40.550 --> 02:45:46.530]
Maybe she'll call back again. See if she... The bottom line is she's got to have the last word. See how that works like all women.

[02:45:47.250 --> 02:45:52.110]
Uh-huh. She's got to have the last word. She already emailed you. So what's the sentence? Why does she keep calling back?

[02:45:52.230 --> 02:45:55.610]
That's the obvious part. You're talking here. I told you. If you tell me what she's going to flood.

[02:45:56.310 --> 02:45:57.310]
She's going to flood what?

[02:45:57.510 --> 02:46:01.150]
You told me? I know where she could put that CD.

[02:46:01.730 --> 02:46:05.710]
And I have a feeling it'll fit perfect. Probably straight now. Well, I'm a blemishes on it too.

[02:46:05.770 --> 02:46:07.390]
In fact, maybe that's how the blemishes got on them.

[02:46:08.910 --> 02:46:13.870]
Five, six, seven, oh, five, six, the pound five, six, and the Verizon singular wireless line.

[02:46:15.270 --> 02:46:16.770]
WDQA, I'm all call radio. Hello.

[02:46:17.330 --> 02:46:19.830]
You would think by now that you would have put it in the right hole.

[02:46:24.450 --> 02:46:26.850]
Okay, we're waiting for the flurry. We waiting for that delayed to catch up.

[02:46:27.810 --> 02:46:31.230]
And I think at 58 bucks said that got owes you for a bus plane at Bitt.

[02:46:31.650 --> 02:46:33.730]
Remember the punk they called before? I'll tell you what it is.

[02:46:33.830 --> 02:46:36.910]
My body's sitting here next to me on my lap on a couch and when you please play the body out, right?

[02:46:37.270 --> 02:46:40.570]
You don't look all like good Rob Marcelloon to me. What's the big deal with him? He's okay.

[02:46:41.490 --> 02:46:44.610]
I mean, he's compared to the other people and the other guys that they got on that network.

[02:46:44.910 --> 02:46:47.510]
They don't really have a lot of good-looking people on their subcandy cowly.

[02:46:49.510 --> 02:46:53.750]
925 votes and of course Wolf Looksrigg in the situation room. Oh, Jesus, God.

[02:46:53.750 --> 02:46:56.410]
Do you think that there's anybody really takes him seriously?

[02:46:56.510 --> 02:46:58.870]
I don't know, himself. I don't know, maybe he has a wife.

[02:46:59.090 --> 02:47:04.070]
Can you just imagine what Jack Kaffirty, the way he must laugh his ass off at the, oh, God.

[02:47:05.150 --> 02:47:08.430]
I mean, Jack is making all these outrageous and outlandish and wonderful comments and,

[02:47:08.670 --> 02:47:14.170]
oh well, Jack, that's one way to look at it. I will be back with Jack in the situation room.

[02:47:15.110 --> 02:47:18.970]
920 votes, we need 72 and 40 minutes. Now, here's the test. If we can make that

[02:47:18.970 --> 02:47:24.130]
1,000 by 2 o'clock after Eric really screwed me over bad yesterday twice, not once but twice.

[02:47:25.310 --> 02:47:29.090]
Now, I come in here. Remember I came in early this morning just to see if he had it up.

[02:47:29.170 --> 02:47:34.930]
I didn't have it up. Something really bad going on up there in Orlando.

[02:47:35.130 --> 02:47:38.770]
And so, as a result, it's pulled and get on it like 830. So, we start with a handy cramp.

[02:47:39.610 --> 02:47:42.330]
But if we can make that 1,000, did you ever really believe we'd get to it?

[02:47:43.530 --> 02:47:48.070]
No, not that we have. I know it's just a real skeptic.

[02:47:48.070 --> 02:47:50.510]
Can we use the hard ass? Yeah, that's it. What?

[02:47:50.850 --> 02:47:54.030]
Well, you thought we'd get it? Of course. Get out of here.

[02:47:54.830 --> 02:47:59.370]
928. It's not even coming in by the ones now, now that you jinked it.

[02:48:00.770 --> 02:48:04.970]
Still 920. I refresh the three times. It's still stuck there. They're just playing with our emotions.

[02:48:05.130 --> 02:48:07.910]
That's all. Or maybe they just don't want you guys to get those good deals.

[02:48:08.850 --> 02:48:12.950]
Because I know there's big, big money coming down the road from Joe Bell.

[02:48:13.210 --> 02:48:15.830]
Oh, yeah, you wait till he, you wait till Joyce finishes with his ass.

[02:48:17.990 --> 02:48:18.710]
WQAM, hello.

[02:48:19.250 --> 02:48:22.250]
Oh, yes, I want to know that. Can't you just play it? Is it on the CD?

[02:48:23.390 --> 02:48:24.590]
Is it on the CD, George?

[02:48:26.090 --> 02:48:26.990]
I don't know.

[02:48:27.490 --> 02:48:28.550]
No, I don't know.

[02:48:28.770 --> 02:48:31.570]
Well, I had one in here and now it's all right. Hang on a second.

[02:48:31.830 --> 02:48:32.350]
Yes, sir.

[02:48:38.370 --> 02:48:39.630]
I don't think it is that.

[02:48:40.970 --> 02:48:41.750]
But you never know.

[02:48:43.910 --> 02:48:45.390]
I've had to put a lot of the cards in front of the door.

[02:48:46.210 --> 02:48:47.870]
I wonder if they bug us about all the time.

[02:48:53.310 --> 02:48:54.370]
Oh, there comes.

[02:48:54.890 --> 02:48:56.210]
Wait, wait, wait. Don't step on the prize.

[02:48:57.470 --> 02:48:59.170]
I got the Disney Disrelax.

[02:48:59.390 --> 02:49:03.290]
Okay, don't let him look in the body augmentation. Is it on there?

[02:49:03.470 --> 02:49:04.850]
I don't think so. It should be.

[02:49:05.570 --> 02:49:09.070]
Of course, the people that put this thing together, man, they had an IQ collective about six.

[02:49:09.070 --> 02:49:11.130]
Of course, it's been on some of the other ones, I guess.

[02:49:11.450 --> 02:49:12.910]
Playing bagpipes is on there.

[02:49:13.850 --> 02:49:14.530]
No, it's not on there.

[02:49:14.790 --> 02:49:15.910]
Sorry. Don't get it.

[02:49:16.390 --> 02:49:16.770]
You're welcome.

[02:49:18.010 --> 02:49:20.850]
Wayne Stauffins on there, Kisser Butt, Fowlmouth Dolphins,

[02:49:22.430 --> 02:49:25.770]
Big Black Ironman Ben, sitting on a bitch in Del Rey,

[02:49:27.130 --> 02:49:29.170]
the Moe of the Doi of the Goli, the Moe of the Doi of the Goli,

[02:49:29.170 --> 02:49:30.510]
the Moe of the Doi of the Doi of the Goli, it's not on there.

[02:49:31.790 --> 02:49:33.110]
And why not, I might ask.

[02:49:33.250 --> 02:49:36.790]
Maybe that's why they're not buying this thing like crazy because the good stuff's not on there.

[02:49:38.870 --> 02:49:41.610]
Loan some faggots on there, right under down on my knees.

[02:49:41.770 --> 02:49:43.350]
Do you think there's any relationship between them?

[02:49:43.950 --> 02:49:44.270]
Yeah.

[02:49:44.530 --> 02:49:45.050]
Of course it is.

[02:49:46.750 --> 02:49:47.830]
It makes me doi.

[02:49:48.110 --> 02:49:51.090]
See, if I didn't put something like that on there, it's because it was on last year or last year.

[02:49:51.090 --> 02:49:52.950]
Yeah, this has been on, what do I mean last year?

[02:49:53.010 --> 02:49:56.770]
We haven't done this in a year before or a lot or more than one or a year.

[02:49:56.770 --> 02:49:57.750]
Yeah, it's been on there too much.

[02:49:58.190 --> 02:49:59.350]
Plus, who now wants to hear?

[02:49:59.510 --> 02:50:00.170]
Paul of these things.

[02:50:00.450 --> 02:50:02.190]
Again, I guess they do.

[02:50:03.310 --> 02:50:04.530]
Now listen, don't buy a paltry.

[02:50:04.530 --> 02:50:09.190]
There's probably going to be defective and then you'll be calling in 15 times and people will be making fun of you and all that stuff.

[02:50:09.430 --> 02:50:09.890]
Don't do that.

[02:50:10.650 --> 02:50:12.430]
It'll create many problems for you.

[02:50:12.470 --> 02:50:13.230]
Paul of these things.

[02:50:14.070 --> 02:50:15.170]
WQA MCD line.

[02:50:15.330 --> 02:50:15.470]
Hello.

[02:50:16.690 --> 02:50:17.910]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[02:50:18.290 --> 02:50:18.590]
Pretty good.

[02:50:18.710 --> 02:50:20.070]
Neil Rogers, CD and pasta.

[02:50:21.190 --> 02:50:25.290]
Leaving this town is bush-league town and going back up on the ride.

[02:50:25.610 --> 02:50:25.850]
Excellent.

[02:50:26.010 --> 02:50:26.570]
Good choice, man.

[02:50:26.870 --> 02:50:31.830]
Okay, now, in closing, hey, y'all, then he's stuck.

[02:50:34.750 --> 02:50:36.810]
How many do, by the way, Josh, they've been losing lately.

[02:50:36.970 --> 02:50:39.130]
I notice people fall off the bandwagon.

[02:50:40.210 --> 02:50:41.090]
They're doing just fine.

[02:50:41.410 --> 02:50:41.990]
It's the last thing.

[02:50:42.110 --> 02:50:44.270]
I know they kicked the Raptors ass here a couple days ago.

[02:50:45.110 --> 02:50:48.270]
And I know the Blue Jays got their ass kicked the hand of two-month plate last night.

[02:50:48.570 --> 02:50:50.090]
You know, they had 50,400 on.

[02:50:50.110 --> 02:50:52.870]
They knew and improved Roger Center Sky dome two nights ago.

[02:50:53.790 --> 02:50:55.310]
Man, that place is really...

[02:50:55.310 --> 02:50:57.030]
I'm going to have to have to go to a few ball games.

[02:50:58.050 --> 02:50:59.750]
That place was rock and opening night.

[02:50:59.910 --> 02:51:02.150]
50,400 and they kicked some serious ass.

[02:51:02.490 --> 02:51:03.810]
Then last night they got walloped.

[02:51:03.810 --> 02:51:06.870]
They got, you know, in fact, last night,

[02:51:06.910 --> 02:51:08.210]
I read in the paper this morning, it says,

[02:51:08.370 --> 02:51:09.950]
people, yeah, that's sarcastic.

[02:51:10.230 --> 02:51:11.310]
To like, but sarcastic.

[02:51:11.590 --> 02:51:13.670]
As the team was going off the field the end of the game,

[02:51:13.990 --> 02:51:15.850]
people were y'all, go leave, go, you know.

[02:51:16.130 --> 02:51:16.730]
Come on now.

[02:51:17.370 --> 02:51:19.590]
That's not nice, just because the Blue Jays lost the game.

[02:51:20.450 --> 02:51:21.130]
That's pretty funny.

[02:51:21.610 --> 02:51:21.970]
Huh?

[02:51:22.210 --> 02:51:22.670]
It's pretty funny.

[02:51:23.050 --> 02:51:23.850]
Yeah, no, it's not.

[02:51:24.670 --> 02:51:25.970]
You don't necessarily have that hockey stuff.

[02:51:26.010 --> 02:51:28.590]
People are now putting a wood to a Patrick Yeliash

[02:51:28.590 --> 02:51:30.910]
with his seventh career hatch rig.

[02:51:31.310 --> 02:51:32.970]
It is now fine too, Jersey.

[02:51:36.530 --> 02:51:37.410]
Here we go.

[02:51:37.490 --> 02:51:40.230]
You can see December the 19th from these two teams last

[02:51:40.230 --> 02:51:40.730]
playing here.

[02:51:40.730 --> 02:51:41.350]
Here come, Harry.

[02:51:41.670 --> 02:51:43.290]
Team goal 67 shots.

[02:51:43.930 --> 02:51:46.630]
Tonight both goalies could win the Veznic Open.

[02:51:46.950 --> 02:51:48.550]
Around backer than that for Dolan.

[02:51:49.230 --> 02:51:50.490]
They tried one, one.

[02:51:51.330 --> 02:51:53.370]
If you're German, please, congratulations.

[02:51:54.250 --> 02:51:55.330]
Backer than Dolan, go.

[02:51:56.790 --> 02:51:59.850]
I'm one of the worst games in history, mankind.

[02:52:00.190 --> 02:52:01.250]
It was pretty bad, you right, Joe.

[02:52:01.250 --> 02:52:04.730]
5'6'7'05'60, Tom 5'60 and the Verizon

[02:52:04.730 --> 02:52:06.110]
Cigarette Riders on the near Rogers,

[02:52:06.590 --> 02:52:09.010]
hockey, CD, repair and pasta show.

[02:52:09.710 --> 02:52:11.270]
Yeah, we had a narrow down a little bit.

[02:52:11.350 --> 02:52:12.870]
We instead of this stream of consciousness,

[02:52:12.870 --> 02:52:15.090]
crap, how about stream of unconsciousness?

[02:52:16.110 --> 02:52:17.470]
As in things like...

[02:52:17.470 --> 02:52:19.170]
There's a guy he sucks, okay?

[02:52:19.450 --> 02:52:19.790]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:52:19.970 --> 02:52:21.830]
Not to have anything to do with anything particular,

[02:52:21.970 --> 02:52:25.970]
just off the wall, like rock solid when you least expected.

[02:52:27.150 --> 02:52:27.930]
WQAM, hello.

[02:52:28.390 --> 02:52:29.010]
Neil, what's up?

[02:52:29.410 --> 02:52:29.870]
How you doing, sir?

[02:52:29.870 --> 02:52:32.190]
I know you're a gigantic Godfather fan,

[02:52:32.190 --> 02:52:34.270]
but I know he talked about the suponors.

[02:52:34.670 --> 02:52:35.450]
Do you think that...

[02:52:35.450 --> 02:52:36.370]
Probably because I don't watch it.

[02:52:36.530 --> 02:52:39.410]
Yeah, I was wondering if you thought it was a swill, as you say.

[02:52:40.430 --> 02:52:42.510]
Swill? I never watched it, so I can't give you an opinion.

[02:52:42.790 --> 02:52:43.370]
I never watched it.

[02:52:43.770 --> 02:52:45.830]
Stop being your blotin' brains all over your nice, I believe.

[02:52:46.050 --> 02:52:46.790]
That's all I need to hear.

[02:52:47.190 --> 02:52:48.130]
Okay, I just hear it.

[02:52:48.230 --> 02:52:50.930]
I know George used to like it, and he says now it sucks.

[02:52:51.610 --> 02:52:53.270]
Hey, I know a great person who can go straight

[02:52:53.270 --> 02:52:54.810]
to your autobiography.

[02:52:54.990 --> 02:52:57.550]
His name is Greg Cody, and I'll blame myself.

[02:52:57.550 --> 02:52:57.550]

[02:53:00.670 --> 02:53:01.670]
That was great.

[02:53:02.090 --> 02:53:04.450]
That's the first he blamed himself off, I like that.

[02:53:04.610 --> 02:53:05.090]
He's the good.

[02:53:06.330 --> 02:53:07.190]
Take the good oldies.

[02:53:07.210 --> 02:53:09.170]
Yeah, you won't hear that on the sopranos, like Euronecia.

[02:53:09.270 --> 02:53:10.710]
I'll probably will one of these days soon.

[02:53:11.530 --> 02:53:12.930]
I guarantee you won't hear this either.

[02:53:13.230 --> 02:53:15.710]
I don't care how many day go, Gennie, what, Greece,

[02:53:15.850 --> 02:53:17.290]
what, Gumbas come out of the woodwork?

[02:53:17.510 --> 02:53:19.130]
Sudan, the Jack Waltsk.

[02:53:20.570 --> 02:53:24.630]
Aerobie character, air-reline, air-re scene, primo, baby, primo,

[02:53:24.990 --> 02:53:25.730]
as good as it gets.

[02:53:26.990 --> 02:53:28.170]
Almost as good as network.

[02:53:28.990 --> 02:53:30.210]
Now how are we doing on that thing?

[02:53:30.750 --> 02:53:33.150]
I wonder if, because the Godfather's Saga is offered long,

[02:53:33.230 --> 02:53:35.190]
Josh better now watch the whole thing, you know.

[02:53:35.990 --> 02:53:37.010]
Like, it's too long to work.

[02:53:37.050 --> 02:53:37.870]
He's been running like crazy.

[02:53:38.250 --> 02:53:38.650]
Yeah, it has.

[02:53:38.970 --> 02:53:40.370]
Has it really since Monday?

[02:53:41.070 --> 02:53:41.610]
Not here.

[02:53:41.870 --> 02:53:42.570]
One, two, and three.

[02:53:43.230 --> 02:53:44.550]
He's been doing a one, two, and a three.

[02:53:45.850 --> 02:53:49.070]
956, he's a 56, he's like in Q56, as in QAMC.

[02:53:49.350 --> 02:53:50.070]
See how clever that is?

[02:53:51.290 --> 02:53:52.550]
956, baby.

[02:53:52.810 --> 02:53:56.010]
44 in 34, even a child could do that.

[02:53:56.170 --> 02:53:58.490]
This is Neil Rogers.

[02:53:59.350 --> 02:54:02.430]
This is 516 QA.

[02:54:11.830 --> 02:54:15.730]
I believe that we have enough future.

[02:54:16.450 --> 02:54:19.390]
If I keep carrying on this way,

[02:54:19.390 --> 02:54:23.910]
if I say I'm sober, it was just a lie.

[02:54:25.230 --> 02:54:31.030]
I am so freaking high, but it is easier

[02:54:31.870 --> 02:54:35.110]
than going to a meeting.

[02:54:36.130 --> 02:54:40.390]
See how my name is with me.

[02:54:40.850 --> 02:54:43.210]
I've got it long ago.

[02:54:43.870 --> 02:54:47.230]
Smoke's upon and deal a little girl.

[02:54:47.230 --> 02:54:49.910]
Peruit and elastic.

[02:54:50.930 --> 02:54:53.870]
Angels dust and sun, say, oh,

[02:54:54.030 --> 02:54:56.890]
they love whistle, they're fanatistic.

[02:54:57.590 --> 02:55:00.970]
Mine if I say that I'm so free.

[02:55:01.830 --> 02:55:05.270]
Airports got you a routine.

[02:55:07.570 --> 02:55:10.870]
They found some time on me.

[02:55:15.230 --> 02:55:17.910]
You'll find the greatest

[02:55:20.490 --> 02:55:24.330]
drugs that are all inside of me.

[02:55:25.110 --> 02:55:25.510]
Absolutely.

[02:55:29.470 --> 02:55:30.270]
971 votes.

[02:55:30.270 --> 02:55:32.670]
We got a half an hour, even at one minute we're going to do that.

[02:55:32.790 --> 02:55:33.210]
How do you like that?

[02:55:33.290 --> 02:55:33.970]
There's Morgan Freeman.

[02:55:34.150 --> 02:55:35.090]
What a great actor he is.

[02:55:35.190 --> 02:55:35.410]
Is it good?

[02:55:35.610 --> 02:55:36.470]
He's enjoying us.

[02:55:36.970 --> 02:55:37.610]
This is him.

[02:55:37.850 --> 02:55:38.010]
This is him.

[02:55:38.010 --> 02:55:40.210]
He's an idiot whoever she is, but he's great.

[02:55:41.010 --> 02:55:42.350]
Nice outfit by the way, Morgan.

[02:55:42.490 --> 02:55:44.490]
He didn't have a cigarette in his hand.

[02:55:44.610 --> 02:55:45.410]
He had a faggot there?

[02:55:45.610 --> 02:55:46.670]
Oh no, that's bad.

[02:55:47.850 --> 02:55:49.450]
Boy, if you were only old enough to remember,

[02:55:49.930 --> 02:55:51.430]
if you were like, you'd probably be dead by now.

[02:55:52.110 --> 02:55:54.170]
But anyway, when he used to like chain smoke on TV,

[02:55:54.210 --> 02:55:56.570]
when you saw the Admiral thing and I'm sure he was smoking.

[02:55:57.110 --> 02:55:58.130]
There's nothing but smoking.

[02:55:58.730 --> 02:55:59.490]
Yeah, going on.

[02:56:00.030 --> 02:56:00.510]
Big cloud.

[02:56:01.950 --> 02:56:03.770]
But I was never talking about cloud of smoke.

[02:56:03.950 --> 02:56:05.410]
I remember all those other TV shows,

[02:56:05.550 --> 02:56:06.990]
like I love Lucy and all that stuff.

[02:56:06.990 --> 02:56:08.090]
Everybody is smoking all the time.

[02:56:08.430 --> 02:56:10.730]
Yeah, and what's this business about the bad stereotypes

[02:56:10.730 --> 02:56:12.270]
about Latinos?

[02:56:12.530 --> 02:56:13.770]
They were screaming about with all those immigrants

[02:56:13.770 --> 02:56:14.590]
the other day on TV.

[02:56:15.010 --> 02:56:17.970]
They had Desi Arnez with me representative of most Latinos.

[02:56:18.250 --> 02:56:18.690]
Hey, Lucy.

[02:56:19.510 --> 02:56:19.630]
Huh?

[02:56:20.750 --> 02:56:22.870]
So we're not most of your people are like just like that.

[02:56:23.010 --> 02:56:23.510]
Just like that.

[02:56:23.510 --> 02:56:23.730]
Lucy, right.

[02:56:24.070 --> 02:56:25.490]
Only they only look like they're going to drop the table.

[02:56:25.490 --> 02:56:27.270]
On this movie, here looks like it's going to be really bad.

[02:56:27.390 --> 02:56:28.590]
Lucky number is sleaven, you know?

[02:56:30.310 --> 02:56:31.130]
Have you seen that movie?

[02:56:31.270 --> 02:56:32.230]
All the Morgan Freeman's in it.

[02:56:32.390 --> 02:56:33.070]
And you know who else is in it?

[02:56:33.150 --> 02:56:34.690]
Josh Hartnick, who's getting really pasty

[02:56:34.690 --> 02:56:35.630]
and on my nerves, he's in it.

[02:56:36.310 --> 02:56:38.770]
You know, Josh Hartnick, he was in 40 days and 40 nights.

[02:56:39.970 --> 02:56:41.510]
And what was that war moment when he was in?

[02:56:42.890 --> 02:56:44.430]
With the belt, Avila, Pearl Harbor.

[02:56:44.790 --> 02:56:45.210]
Pearl Harbor.

[02:56:45.610 --> 02:56:46.290]
Oh yeah, I remember that.

[02:56:46.390 --> 02:56:46.870]
Never saw it.

[02:56:48.010 --> 02:56:48.450]
Neither'd me.

[02:56:49.010 --> 02:56:49.750]
I saw it in the movie.

[02:56:50.010 --> 02:56:51.850]
The only movie I ever saw him in that I liked.

[02:56:52.030 --> 02:56:54.450]
In fact, I discovered him just like I discovered Britney Spears.

[02:56:54.830 --> 02:56:58.070]
He was in the Halloween part, 400 with Jamie Lee Bush Curtis.

[02:56:58.530 --> 02:56:58.870]
Okay.

[02:56:59.150 --> 02:57:00.290]
Black Hawk Down, he was in.

[02:57:00.590 --> 02:57:01.710]
Black Hawk Down, he was in.

[02:57:01.790 --> 02:57:02.830]
Oh yeah, I know you like him a lot.

[02:57:03.410 --> 02:57:03.810]
Yeah.

[02:57:04.550 --> 02:57:07.190]
Yeah, I don't do a relaxed Jesus God.

[02:57:07.390 --> 02:57:09.630]
He's just a pasty punk is all he is.

[02:57:09.750 --> 02:57:11.230]
You know, a pasty punk.

[02:57:11.790 --> 02:57:14.350]
And I take back what I said about the Justin Bell there.

[02:57:14.370 --> 02:57:16.010]
They remember when the hearings were on three days ago,

[02:57:16.070 --> 02:57:16.570]
the first time.

[02:57:17.130 --> 02:57:19.030]
First time I laid my eyes on him and I said,

[02:57:19.210 --> 02:57:20.790]
I take it back because he,

[02:57:20.930 --> 02:57:22.910]
it damn it like like Britney, damage goods.

[02:57:24.650 --> 02:57:25.350]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:57:25.650 --> 02:57:27.650]
I mean, he's damn near 20 now and he does look pretty good,

[02:57:27.690 --> 02:57:29.090]
but damage goods just like Britney.

[02:57:30.010 --> 02:57:31.230]
You see the similarity there?

[02:57:32.210 --> 02:57:35.430]
Only I think in his case, really damn it's goods.

[02:57:35.710 --> 02:57:36.270]
Well worn.

[02:57:36.530 --> 02:57:37.130]
Oh God.

[02:57:38.210 --> 02:57:39.290]
978 votes on the pool.

[02:57:39.390 --> 02:57:41.750]
What is that pool of all the things Neil talks about,

[02:57:41.750 --> 02:57:43.530]
which is the most important, interesting to you.

[02:57:44.470 --> 02:57:44.830]
Right.

[02:57:44.970 --> 02:57:45.790]
Yeah, look at that.

[02:57:45.810 --> 02:57:46.890]
Look at that from one.

[02:57:46.990 --> 02:57:49.190]
It always got him as cold off, which is a bad idea.

[02:57:49.510 --> 02:57:53.390]
Because his body is as pasty as the rest of them too, Josh Hartner.

[02:57:53.730 --> 02:57:55.310]
Pasty, at least more in preview.

[02:57:55.310 --> 02:57:56.810]
He's got a good, it's suntan.

[02:57:58.130 --> 02:57:58.910]
Politics, 450.

[02:57:59.350 --> 02:58:00.090]
That's what they want to hear.

[02:58:00.090 --> 02:58:01.110]
Bush bashing.

[02:58:01.210 --> 02:58:05.310]
They want to hear Bush in his moron, his red carer is okay.

[02:58:05.530 --> 02:58:07.790]
This symbol that's still not one, but two elections

[02:58:07.790 --> 02:58:10.010]
with the help of his girlfriend,

[02:58:10.230 --> 02:58:12.790]
Catherine Harris, and his accrucated fat ass brother.

[02:58:14.490 --> 02:58:16.170]
Inside radio stuff, 133.

[02:58:16.290 --> 02:58:18.050]
And if we ever get back even close to being in radio,

[02:58:18.050 --> 02:58:18.750]
we'll let you know.

[02:58:19.370 --> 02:58:20.730]
Let's you know where we are in the dial.

[02:58:21.810 --> 02:58:22.570]
Religion 103.

[02:58:23.350 --> 02:58:24.610]
Whatever he is again, make it.

[02:58:24.710 --> 02:58:25.990]
Put some clothes on him already.

[02:58:26.090 --> 02:58:26.550]
Where did Jesus?

[02:58:27.090 --> 02:58:27.810]
I hit this pool.

[02:58:27.970 --> 02:58:28.330]
67.

[02:58:28.850 --> 02:58:30.090]
Jewish stuff 48.

[02:58:31.050 --> 02:58:32.690]
Foods and restaurants 43.

[02:58:33.150 --> 02:58:34.010]
Hockey 34.

[02:58:34.390 --> 02:58:35.530]
Let's have some hockey talk.

[02:58:35.690 --> 02:58:36.090]
What do you say?

[02:58:37.190 --> 02:58:38.190]
Anything that's time for it?

[02:58:38.550 --> 02:58:39.310]
The hockey talk.

[02:58:39.490 --> 02:58:39.730]
Hope.

[02:58:39.930 --> 02:58:40.570]
And a center in Toronto.

[02:58:40.570 --> 02:58:41.710]
A one-one tie.

[02:58:41.890 --> 02:58:43.350]
Alexa Yashin scoring for the honor.

[02:58:43.410 --> 02:58:43.990]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[02:58:44.390 --> 02:58:45.170]
Hockey 34.

[02:58:45.450 --> 02:58:46.330]
Gaze stuff 32.

[02:58:47.010 --> 02:58:48.270]
Slots in gambling 21.

[02:58:48.730 --> 02:58:50.550]
The key is get a good machine man.

[02:58:50.790 --> 02:58:51.650]
Let me tell you right now.

[02:58:52.010 --> 02:58:52.750]
That's the secret.

[02:58:53.030 --> 02:58:53.890]
Find a good machine.

[02:58:54.790 --> 02:58:56.430]
And if you see somebody else with a good machine,

[02:58:56.430 --> 02:58:58.470]
just knock their ass off and grab it.

[02:58:58.930 --> 02:58:59.870]
Sit right down.

[02:59:01.130 --> 02:59:03.170]
I am student 13 old news.

[02:59:03.390 --> 02:59:04.530]
Then there are about 4,000 times

[02:59:04.530 --> 02:59:05.410]
where we're getting a little bit old.

[02:59:05.950 --> 02:59:06.690]
All those Dutchmen.

[02:59:06.970 --> 02:59:07.750]
Immigration 10.

[02:59:07.910 --> 02:59:08.650]
Health problems 8.

[02:59:08.950 --> 02:59:09.590]
The track 8.

[02:59:09.930 --> 02:59:10.550]
Dietalk 4.

[02:59:10.710 --> 02:59:11.510]
And the stock market 4.

[02:59:11.970 --> 02:59:13.290]
So there's the last five or six categories.

[02:59:13.570 --> 02:59:13.970]
Just Schmidt can't.

[02:59:14.030 --> 02:59:14.590]
I'm like I told it.

[02:59:14.750 --> 02:59:15.290]
Schmidt can't.

[02:59:15.810 --> 02:59:16.450]
Give him the mic.

[02:59:16.570 --> 02:59:16.730]
Schmidt.

[02:59:16.910 --> 02:59:17.630]
Or give him the Joe Schmidt.

[02:59:18.490 --> 02:59:19.250]
And the old Detroit lines.

[02:59:19.330 --> 02:59:20.470]
What are how Van Patrick's doing?

[02:59:20.550 --> 02:59:21.330]
He was fat and you know what?

[02:59:21.330 --> 02:59:21.950]
Have an Amy died.

[02:59:22.350 --> 02:59:23.270]
Fat guy dead.

[02:59:24.150 --> 02:59:25.270]
Notice the coincidence there?

[02:59:26.670 --> 02:59:27.350]
No coincidence.

[02:59:27.510 --> 02:59:28.930]
I'm going to make someone that passed it for lunch.

[02:59:29.090 --> 02:59:29.550]
You know what we're going to do?

[02:59:29.610 --> 02:59:31.150]
I'm going to make somebody that low-carb saws.

[02:59:31.150 --> 02:59:32.710]
I'm going to slice up a weiner.

[02:59:34.350 --> 02:59:35.010]
John weiner.

[02:59:35.030 --> 02:59:35.850]
We're going to slice him up.

[02:59:35.970 --> 02:59:36.550]
Don't touch.

[02:59:36.850 --> 02:59:37.670]
And a chopping machine.

[02:59:37.910 --> 02:59:38.930]
John weiner stew guys.

[02:59:39.050 --> 02:59:39.170]
Stop.

[02:59:40.090 --> 02:59:41.190]
Oh a chopping machine.

[02:59:41.430 --> 02:59:41.710]
I thought he said.

[02:59:41.830 --> 02:59:42.750]
Let me ask you something.

[02:59:42.970 --> 02:59:43.070]
Seriously.

[02:59:43.370 --> 02:59:43.810]
Oh, that's right.

[02:59:43.910 --> 02:59:44.710]
Hank didn't have nickname.

[02:59:46.050 --> 02:59:48.190]
Because his real name is John weiner.

[02:59:48.430 --> 02:59:49.810]
You know, he's got a face of voice

[02:59:49.810 --> 02:59:50.970]
and a name for a radio.

[02:59:53.710 --> 02:59:54.430]
Not WDQAM.

[02:59:54.450 --> 02:59:54.710]
Hello.

[02:59:55.770 --> 02:59:56.890]
Can you feel his pasta?

[02:59:57.490 --> 02:59:58.070]
The half.

[02:59:58.390 --> 02:59:59.610]
Can you feel his pasta?

[03:00:04.690 --> 03:00:06.490]
Sound like he was sitting on a strand of his leg.

[03:00:06.490 --> 03:00:06.790]
No.

[03:00:07.010 --> 03:00:07.730]
Didn't sound like that.

[03:00:08.250 --> 03:00:08.850]
Sound like something.

[03:00:09.390 --> 03:00:10.950]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 6, 7, 0.

[03:00:10.950 --> 03:00:12.270]
You're going to like it when we take all the calls.

[03:00:12.550 --> 03:00:13.750]
I'm just I'm tired of all this.

[03:00:14.190 --> 03:00:16.130]
We'll get the living and breathing people back.

[03:00:16.250 --> 03:00:16.850]
Listen to this show.

[03:00:17.170 --> 03:00:19.270]
People out at the age of 100 don't care what's going on.

[03:00:19.350 --> 03:00:20.890]
They won't know one of your all these stories.

[03:00:21.150 --> 03:00:22.510]
Even though we had the story on first

[03:00:22.510 --> 03:00:24.230]
about how Bush admitted he gave the go ahead.

[03:00:24.230 --> 03:00:26.450]
He authorized the outing of Valerie Plame.

[03:00:26.550 --> 03:00:28.150]
We had that on nobody cares.

[03:00:28.410 --> 03:00:31.270]
Nobody out of the age of 100 even knows Valerie Plame from flame.

[03:00:31.610 --> 03:00:31.770]
Okay.

[03:00:32.310 --> 03:00:33.710]
Actually, you know, it's flaming.

[03:00:34.070 --> 03:00:34.890]
Flaming, home mode.

[03:00:35.010 --> 03:00:35.690]
That's all they know.

[03:00:36.210 --> 03:00:36.730]
You know what I'm saying?

[03:00:37.210 --> 03:00:39.490]
Because now the new deal is if it's then it's in.

[03:00:40.150 --> 03:00:43.130]
Not only that, but let me ask you this.

[03:00:43.250 --> 03:00:44.390]
What are you going to do about it?

[03:00:44.650 --> 03:00:45.190]
You fairy.

[03:00:45.870 --> 03:00:46.270]
WDQAM.

[03:00:46.410 --> 03:00:46.570]
Hello.

[03:00:47.470 --> 03:00:47.870]
Neil.

[03:00:48.590 --> 03:00:49.150]
Yes, sir.

[03:00:49.330 --> 03:00:49.950]
Quick question.

[03:00:50.270 --> 03:00:53.290]
What is the origin of the, I'm dying over here.

[03:00:53.290 --> 03:00:54.150]
Audio business.

[03:00:54.430 --> 03:00:55.690]
I'm dying over here.

[03:00:56.210 --> 03:00:56.610]
Caller.

[03:00:56.710 --> 03:00:57.590]
He's dead now, by the way.

[03:00:57.650 --> 03:00:59.110]
The original origin was in the movie.

[03:00:59.670 --> 03:01:00.590]
What was the movie?

[03:01:00.890 --> 03:01:01.410]
Dog day afternoon.

[03:01:01.630 --> 03:01:02.810]
Dog day afternoon with Al Pacino.

[03:01:03.250 --> 03:01:03.910]
Oh, okay.

[03:01:04.210 --> 03:01:06.330]
Don't you remember when he and Frater robbed the bank, the Indian?

[03:01:07.170 --> 03:01:07.570]
No.

[03:01:07.870 --> 03:01:08.510]
And it was outside.

[03:01:08.670 --> 03:01:10.290]
We never saw that dog day afternoon.

[03:01:10.510 --> 03:01:10.930]
No, I didn't.

[03:01:11.210 --> 03:01:12.590]
Well, you only like it.

[03:01:12.730 --> 03:01:13.630]
It's got a sex change.

[03:01:13.650 --> 03:01:14.470]
A freaking there.

[03:01:15.430 --> 03:01:16.490]
What that was its name?

[03:01:16.810 --> 03:01:17.610]
I remember what her name is.

[03:01:17.610 --> 03:01:18.790]
Christopher Randon is the actor's name.

[03:01:19.070 --> 03:01:19.530]
I don't know.

[03:01:19.610 --> 03:01:20.550]
I see how to like Christopher Randon.

[03:01:20.750 --> 03:01:21.250]
No, it needed.

[03:01:21.730 --> 03:01:22.590]
I can't stand it.

[03:01:23.030 --> 03:01:24.550]
There's a Josh Harton and make it again.

[03:01:24.670 --> 03:01:25.710]
See, look at that.

[03:01:25.870 --> 03:01:26.290]
There he is.

[03:01:26.550 --> 03:01:27.750]
Where he's pasty.

[03:01:27.910 --> 03:01:28.770]
I don't like pasty.

[03:01:28.870 --> 03:01:29.410]
I don't see you about.

[03:01:29.570 --> 03:01:30.250]
No, it's untidy.

[03:01:30.290 --> 03:01:31.090]
He might look a little bit better,

[03:01:31.230 --> 03:01:32.890]
but the past and it was just a towel on.

[03:01:33.070 --> 03:01:34.550]
And it keeps showing it over and over again.

[03:01:34.830 --> 03:01:36.510]
I think, well, Flutzkrieg is behind that.

[03:01:37.050 --> 03:01:39.390]
He's probably wanting to get Josh in the situation room.

[03:01:40.490 --> 03:01:41.310]
Five, six, seven.

[03:01:41.790 --> 03:01:44.610]
I know, Duff said they want to get Josh in the situation room.

[03:01:44.610 --> 03:01:45.910]
And he wasn't talking about clearance either.

[03:01:47.290 --> 03:01:48.590]
So you won't see Duff anymore.

[03:01:48.710 --> 03:01:49.470]
Because he's responsible.

[03:01:49.790 --> 03:01:51.770]
I blame him more than anybody else for that.

[03:01:51.770 --> 03:01:53.290]
The best up thing for that stupid.

[03:01:53.350 --> 03:01:54.350]
Stop turning me down.

[03:01:54.390 --> 03:01:55.470]
Now, I give him credit for the fact

[03:01:55.470 --> 03:01:57.250]
that Kevin Baxter did that thing in a Harold.

[03:01:58.070 --> 03:01:59.530]
Now, if he would just call Tom Jikap,

[03:01:59.670 --> 03:02:01.810]
I'm sure Tom would have given like 10 pages on it.

[03:02:01.950 --> 03:02:02.910]
Although I do know this,

[03:02:03.750 --> 03:02:05.850]
if we get to 1,000 votes on a poll today

[03:02:05.850 --> 03:02:08.030]
by two o'clock after that bad start,

[03:02:08.230 --> 03:02:09.190]
thanks to Eric Strunath,

[03:02:09.890 --> 03:02:11.490]
it'll be on the front pages of the Sun Central.

[03:02:11.650 --> 03:02:13.130]
Tom Jikap will have his violin on it.

[03:02:13.870 --> 03:02:14.750]
Do you think tomorrow?

[03:02:15.310 --> 03:02:15.510]
Okay.

[03:02:16.330 --> 03:02:18.030]
It'll be all over like stink on Greg.

[03:02:18.310 --> 03:02:20.250]
9.97, I think we got a shot at it.

[03:02:20.250 --> 03:02:21.590]
23 minutes, we need three votes.

[03:02:21.850 --> 03:02:23.310]
I wouldn't be surprised at a little Tommy

[03:02:23.310 --> 03:02:25.310]
and his friends in the gaming industry,

[03:02:25.430 --> 03:02:26.430]
the cruise ship industry doing.

[03:02:27.330 --> 03:02:29.570]
I wonder if it's his son that works in the cruise ship line.

[03:02:30.130 --> 03:02:30.970]
Call him up and find out.

[03:02:31.790 --> 03:02:32.450]
WDQAM, hello.

[03:02:33.370 --> 03:02:33.910]
Yeah, Neil.

[03:02:34.310 --> 03:02:34.630]
Yes, sir.

[03:02:35.170 --> 03:02:35.570]
How you doing?

[03:02:35.730 --> 03:02:36.310]
I just heard it.

[03:02:36.550 --> 03:02:37.990]
Spread some more right wing stuff.

[03:02:38.510 --> 03:02:40.350]
My son goes to the University of Florida.

[03:02:41.130 --> 03:02:43.630]
And he went into, he saw Ann Coulter.

[03:02:44.270 --> 03:02:46.430]
He's a nice Jewish liberal Democrat,

[03:02:46.670 --> 03:02:47.930]
but he wanted to spread his views.

[03:02:47.930 --> 03:02:50.590]
So we went to see Ann Coulter speak on campus.

[03:02:50.870 --> 03:02:51.050]
Yeah.

[03:02:51.910 --> 03:02:54.230]
And she was spreading a lot of right wing propaganda.

[03:02:55.030 --> 03:02:55.670]
How do you hear?

[03:02:55.810 --> 03:02:56.590]
She spreads it, yeah.

[03:02:56.710 --> 03:02:57.830]
She spread that heavy.

[03:02:58.410 --> 03:03:01.450]
And we should bring our democratic,

[03:03:02.190 --> 03:03:04.810]
Christian democracy to all nations throughout the world.

[03:03:05.130 --> 03:03:05.570]
Oh, yeah.

[03:03:05.670 --> 03:03:06.090]
Who can do it?

[03:03:06.090 --> 03:03:07.630]
My job is we're doing in Iraq, man.

[03:03:07.630 --> 03:03:08.430]
We don't have to worry about it.

[03:03:08.430 --> 03:03:09.150]
It's all be dead.

[03:03:09.610 --> 03:03:10.190]
You got it.

[03:03:10.270 --> 03:03:12.250]
And also he wanted a year in heckle, little.

[03:03:12.350 --> 03:03:13.430]
But he said there's security.

[03:03:13.870 --> 03:03:15.050]
They were who stepping around.

[03:03:15.190 --> 03:03:16.770]
There was so much security force.

[03:03:16.770 --> 03:03:19.570]
He just kept his mouth shut and did everything.

[03:03:19.710 --> 03:03:20.970]
Damn good thing he didn't bring his Mrs.

[03:03:21.170 --> 03:03:21.790]
or wouldn't he be?

[03:03:21.990 --> 03:03:23.290]
He would come for it.

[03:03:23.310 --> 03:03:24.590]
He'd be resurcomposed.

[03:03:24.830 --> 03:03:26.130]
Have a seasoned pay saw, Camigo.

[03:03:26.550 --> 03:03:27.050]
You too.

[03:03:27.390 --> 03:03:28.370]
See that?

[03:03:28.370 --> 03:03:28.830]
See that?

[03:03:28.870 --> 03:03:30.550]
That's a little code here among us to Jews.

[03:03:31.290 --> 03:03:32.630]
And I have no idea what they mean.

[03:03:32.730 --> 03:03:33.010]
Yeah, I know.

[03:03:34.210 --> 03:03:37.010]
And we, how do we get by poor without the homentage, you know?

[03:03:38.010 --> 03:03:38.850]
What are you talking about?

[03:03:39.450 --> 03:03:40.330]
I got a homentage.

[03:03:40.690 --> 03:03:40.930]
Why?

[03:03:41.370 --> 03:03:41.950]
I got a homentage.

[03:03:42.110 --> 03:03:42.490]
By the way,

[03:03:43.510 --> 03:03:44.610]
where he didn't, where he didn't.

[03:03:44.630 --> 03:03:45.490]
Where he didn't, and two.

[03:03:45.490 --> 03:03:46.170]
No, you didn't.

[03:03:46.250 --> 03:03:46.770]
You got bricks.

[03:03:48.170 --> 03:03:49.150]
I did not get a homentage.

[03:03:49.150 --> 03:03:49.690]
I didn't need it.

[03:03:49.790 --> 03:03:50.550]
Nothing, you mentioned it.

[03:03:50.590 --> 03:03:51.050]
Yeah, huh?

[03:03:52.010 --> 03:03:53.410]
You know, we like to have Halberstam.

[03:03:53.410 --> 03:03:55.310]
We're talking about not the one that's the famous author,

[03:03:55.390 --> 03:03:56.490]
but the one he's an author too.

[03:03:56.610 --> 03:03:58.790]
But the former voice of the heat that got screwed over.

[03:03:59.110 --> 03:04:01.050]
Because he allegedly made some kind of a racial comment.

[03:04:01.370 --> 03:04:02.810]
Yeah, that was a bad screw and over.

[03:04:02.890 --> 03:04:03.450]
He's a good guy.

[03:04:03.650 --> 03:04:05.010]
Halby, you know?

[03:04:09.850 --> 03:04:11.690]
That was him after he got canned with the heat.

[03:04:12.830 --> 03:04:14.830]
But every year at a poor time,

[03:04:14.830 --> 03:04:15.870]
he sends a care package.

[03:04:16.090 --> 03:04:17.610]
He sends one of Hank and sent one,

[03:04:17.770 --> 03:04:18.590]
he used to send it to me,

[03:04:18.690 --> 03:04:19.190]
but I'm not there.

[03:04:19.450 --> 03:04:19.790]
Thank God.

[03:04:20.470 --> 03:04:21.630]
And so now he sends it to you guys.

[03:04:21.930 --> 03:04:23.250]
Did Joshi name those?

[03:04:23.310 --> 03:04:24.910]
You didn't name those little triangle things.

[03:04:25.230 --> 03:04:26.170]
I didn't.

[03:04:26.170 --> 03:04:28.030]
No, I shouldn't have had to ask because you're still alive.

[03:04:28.770 --> 03:04:30.770]
So those things will lay in your pulpit like a brick.

[03:04:31.010 --> 03:04:31.810]
They are absolutely.

[03:04:31.890 --> 03:04:32.370]
All the way to.

[03:04:32.990 --> 03:04:33.950]
With all due respect,

[03:04:34.410 --> 03:04:37.090]
you're the only person that tells the kind that you do.

[03:04:37.210 --> 03:04:38.190]
I've never met another Jew.

[03:04:38.190 --> 03:04:39.870]
Well, you've had the other ones in the red.

[03:04:39.870 --> 03:04:41.290]
I've had the other ones that are telling you.

[03:04:41.450 --> 03:04:41.690]
And?

[03:04:41.890 --> 03:04:42.490]
There's no difference.

[03:04:42.690 --> 03:04:43.390]
There's no comparison.

[03:04:43.390 --> 03:04:45.190]
I mean, those are great.

[03:04:45.490 --> 03:04:46.690]
The bread he ones are great.

[03:04:46.930 --> 03:04:49.930]
The point that I'm trying to make is I have yet to have been for hosts.

[03:04:50.010 --> 03:04:50.550]
We did it.

[03:04:50.550 --> 03:04:51.030]
Thank you.

[03:04:51.030 --> 03:04:52.870]
That even knows what you're talking about.

[03:04:53.430 --> 03:04:54.110]
What do you think?

[03:04:54.110 --> 03:04:54.570]
What do you think?

[03:04:54.690 --> 03:04:55.390]
I have yet to know.

[03:04:55.430 --> 03:04:56.550]
Don't you think I know a Jew or two?

[03:04:56.790 --> 03:04:58.250]
Any other Jew besides you

[03:04:58.250 --> 03:04:59.970]
that even knows what those other ones are?

[03:05:00.030 --> 03:05:01.050]
Get that in here.

[03:05:01.230 --> 03:05:02.130]
Give me a break.

[03:05:02.370 --> 03:05:03.250]
Well, we don't have a shortage of them now.

[03:05:03.250 --> 03:05:05.750]
Do you think that my family got those little brick triangles there?

[03:05:05.790 --> 03:05:06.770]
I think only the orthodox.

[03:05:06.770 --> 03:05:08.070]
Only the geckysy though.

[03:05:08.190 --> 03:05:08.770]
I have geckys.

[03:05:09.290 --> 03:05:10.390]
It wasn't the long we had.

[03:05:10.590 --> 03:05:12.010]
It's not a bit of a perfect mess.

[03:05:12.010 --> 03:05:13.730]
You know, they're bloody kneecaps.

[03:05:16.170 --> 03:05:18.350]
Excuse me, but I do believe that stuff's epic.

[03:05:22.910 --> 03:05:23.890]
Agent Ethan on.

[03:05:24.050 --> 03:05:24.290]
Excuse me.

[03:05:24.770 --> 03:05:26.710]
Your mission if you choose to accept it.

[03:05:26.830 --> 03:05:27.830]
And you have my mission.

[03:05:28.050 --> 03:05:29.270]
Yeah, my mission.

[03:05:29.550 --> 03:05:31.030]
It involves I-

[03:05:31.030 --> 03:05:31.470]
Except I do.

[03:05:32.130 --> 03:05:32.330]
I-

[03:05:32.330 --> 03:05:32.430]
Except.

[03:05:33.090 --> 03:05:34.970]
You might have finished with the hell I'm supposed to tell you.

[03:05:34.990 --> 03:05:35.830]
I was on Oprah.

[03:05:35.830 --> 03:05:36.130]
He-

[03:05:40.630 --> 03:05:45.990]
This name is mission if he chooses to accept it.

[03:05:46.830 --> 03:05:47.510]
Is to-

[03:05:47.510 --> 03:05:47.830]
My mission.

[03:05:48.010 --> 03:05:49.090]
The possible phrase.

[03:05:49.910 --> 03:05:50.510]
Is to-

[03:05:50.510 --> 03:05:50.530]
It's great.

[03:05:50.970 --> 03:05:51.470]
My mission.

[03:05:51.670 --> 03:05:55.710]
Is to-

[03:05:55.710 --> 03:05:56.110]
My mission.

[03:05:56.910 --> 03:06:00.570]
Tom Cruise stars as Tom Cruise as

[03:06:01.190 --> 03:06:02.450]
Ethan Hunt in.

[03:06:04.170 --> 03:06:05.090]
Mission impossible three.

[03:06:05.830 --> 03:06:07.630]
Not another Tom Cruise movie.

[03:06:07.630 --> 03:06:07.970]
My mission.

[03:06:08.190 --> 03:06:08.410]
My mission.

[03:06:09.830 --> 03:06:10.850]
Come soon with theaters.

[03:06:11.030 --> 03:06:12.090]
Hopefully go all the way sooner.

[03:06:12.710 --> 03:06:13.510]
Squishing impossible.

[03:06:13.850 --> 03:06:14.210]
You're fair.

[03:06:14.330 --> 03:06:15.150]
With little Tommy there.

[03:06:15.650 --> 03:06:16.990]
You're really fooling everybody Tommy.

[03:06:17.270 --> 03:06:17.410]
Not.

[03:06:17.650 --> 03:06:18.670]
And that kitty homesting man.

[03:06:18.770 --> 03:06:20.690]
I really went over like a pregnant pole vault, didn't it?

[03:06:21.150 --> 03:06:22.230]
I wonder who'd done her anyway.

[03:06:22.470 --> 03:06:23.090]
Sure it wasn't him.

[03:06:24.450 --> 03:06:25.050]
Wasn't me?

[03:06:25.570 --> 03:06:25.870]
No.

[03:06:26.090 --> 03:06:27.070]
Well, that's unfortunate.

[03:06:27.310 --> 03:06:27.590]
In your case.

[03:06:27.770 --> 03:06:28.230]
Sixteen-till-

[03:06:28.230 --> 03:06:28.290]
Oh.

[03:06:28.510 --> 03:06:30.630]
I can't stop thinking about that broad occoding here.

[03:06:30.690 --> 03:06:31.830]
I made it times forty times today.

[03:06:32.410 --> 03:06:33.250]
Maybe not forty.

[03:06:33.350 --> 03:06:33.870]
I'm exaggerating.

[03:06:33.890 --> 03:06:34.730]
About thirty minutes.

[03:06:34.790 --> 03:06:36.530]
Thirty times with her CD problem.

[03:06:37.070 --> 03:06:39.350]
You're supposed to go over there and like look it and make it better.

[03:06:39.970 --> 03:06:41.390]
Thousand and nine votes on the pool.

[03:06:41.530 --> 03:06:42.270]
How do you like that?

[03:06:42.570 --> 03:06:45.450]
Wouldn't surprise me if Eric could tack a few of those bogus ones on there.

[03:06:46.190 --> 03:06:47.630]
It's rather like cover his tracks from yesterday.

[03:06:47.750 --> 03:06:48.290]
Thousand and eleven.

[03:06:48.610 --> 03:06:50.010]
Now we had a maiden to shave.

[03:06:51.550 --> 03:06:53.230]
I know what I believe in the million years.

[03:06:53.410 --> 03:06:54.770]
I wouldn't even gonna try for it.

[03:06:55.810 --> 03:06:56.230]
Were we-

[03:06:56.230 --> 03:06:57.450]
Were we gonna even think about that?

[03:06:57.910 --> 03:06:58.730]
I-I didn't want to.

[03:06:58.930 --> 03:07:01.390]
And all of a sudden they were like mounting and mounting and mounting.

[03:07:03.370 --> 03:07:05.790]
Five six seven oh five six these big into Tommy.

[03:07:05.850 --> 03:07:06.230]
You're fair.

[03:07:06.390 --> 03:07:07.670]
Palm five sixty under Verizon.

[03:07:07.810 --> 03:07:08.550]
Sing it over by the sign.

[03:07:08.670 --> 03:07:10.170]
A lot of the way man we got eight million openings.

[03:07:10.370 --> 03:07:11.710]
Now we're gonna have to condition these people again.

[03:07:11.750 --> 03:07:13.430]
We're taking forty thousand calls today.

[03:07:13.470 --> 03:07:15.030]
Every day now it's that these stupid stories.

[03:07:16.110 --> 03:07:18.530]
So you know we're gonna get way to good at the audience back

[03:07:18.530 --> 03:07:19.930]
on this horse ball station.

[03:07:20.130 --> 03:07:20.350]
Man.

[03:07:20.350 --> 03:07:20.830]
Oh man.

[03:07:21.050 --> 03:07:23.090]
If anybody was away last weekend, didn't you hear the trends?

[03:07:23.350 --> 03:07:24.730]
We did fine from 10 to two.

[03:07:24.910 --> 03:07:25.470]
Ha ha ha.

[03:07:25.630 --> 03:07:26.590]
That's all you need to know.

[03:07:26.730 --> 03:07:27.770]
Oh my god.

[03:07:28.350 --> 03:07:28.870]
It was scary.

[03:07:29.050 --> 03:07:29.930]
Wouldn't it- wouldn't it kind of scary?

[03:07:31.130 --> 03:07:32.450]
Kind of a little bit.

[03:07:32.530 --> 03:07:32.650]
Hello.

[03:07:32.850 --> 03:07:33.250]
Hello.

[03:07:33.470 --> 03:07:33.710]
Hello.

[03:07:33.810 --> 03:07:35.010]
Not surprising but scary.

[03:07:35.170 --> 03:07:35.650]
Q.A.M.

[03:07:35.990 --> 03:07:36.830]
Anyhow, how's it going?

[03:07:37.270 --> 03:07:37.550]
All right.

[03:07:37.990 --> 03:07:38.230]
All right.

[03:07:38.410 --> 03:07:40.430]
The thing is that you have those for the ad voice show

[03:07:40.430 --> 03:07:42.350]
and you got forty people call them like that.

[03:07:43.050 --> 03:07:45.830]
Um, well, nice to see you.

[03:07:45.890 --> 03:07:47.310]
You're a fellow that call very important.

[03:07:47.690 --> 03:07:49.450]
Uh, uh, it comes on right after the day.

[03:07:49.610 --> 03:07:49.830]
We show.

[03:07:50.490 --> 03:07:52.510]
Got our downed brown on there last week.

[03:07:53.030 --> 03:07:53.510]
I'm Friday.

[03:07:54.090 --> 03:07:54.810]
Michael Brown.

[03:07:55.210 --> 03:07:55.790]
Brown Brown.

[03:07:56.170 --> 03:07:57.290]
Oh, Mickey Brownie Brown.

[03:07:57.470 --> 03:07:57.530]
Yeah.

[03:07:57.530 --> 03:07:57.890]
Yeah.

[03:07:57.990 --> 03:07:59.910]
I'm on there and already for doing.

[03:08:00.150 --> 03:08:03.670]
He tried to go on there and try to shoot some blame around the blame beam.

[03:08:03.670 --> 03:08:06.170]
I remember that that's the best video I had.

[03:08:06.250 --> 03:08:08.150]
Uh, they had a mom there so good.

[03:08:09.030 --> 03:08:10.210]
And it was just hilarious.

[03:08:10.890 --> 03:08:11.510]
It was a great tie.

[03:08:11.510 --> 03:08:12.570]
I thought you might have seen it.

[03:08:12.630 --> 03:08:12.970]
It was awesome.

[03:08:14.250 --> 03:08:15.290]
Just letting you know.

[03:08:15.350 --> 03:08:16.390]
The blame guy.

[03:08:16.770 --> 03:08:17.270]
Ha ha ha.

[03:08:17.270 --> 03:08:17.890]
And the Reno.

[03:08:18.390 --> 03:08:19.070]
Reno Reno.

[03:08:19.170 --> 03:08:19.550]
Bovino.

[03:08:19.730 --> 03:08:20.070]
Banana.

[03:08:20.250 --> 03:08:20.510]
Banana.

[03:08:20.710 --> 03:08:21.110]
Bovino.

[03:08:21.530 --> 03:08:21.930]
B5.

[03:08:22.130 --> 03:08:22.310]
Moe.

[03:08:22.490 --> 03:08:22.650]
No.

[03:08:22.930 --> 03:08:23.670]
Where your accent?

[03:08:24.290 --> 03:08:25.170]
That's the right one.

[03:08:25.530 --> 03:08:26.590]
That's a different blame game.

[03:08:27.830 --> 03:08:29.350]
I remember as we had children.

[03:08:29.750 --> 03:08:30.970]
The blame game.

[03:08:31.250 --> 03:08:31.510]
Did you?

[03:08:32.290 --> 03:08:33.150]
I do though.

[03:08:37.350 --> 03:08:39.030]
I do though.

[03:08:39.710 --> 03:08:40.510]
Oh, bro.

[03:08:41.710 --> 03:08:43.090]
Uncle, uncle, uncle, uncle.

[03:08:43.290 --> 03:08:43.470]
Banana.

[03:08:43.710 --> 03:08:44.150]
Penical.

[03:08:44.310 --> 03:08:44.730]
Flanko.

[03:08:44.870 --> 03:08:45.670]
Feed by a mom.

[03:08:45.850 --> 03:08:46.250]
Uncle.

[03:08:46.650 --> 03:08:46.870]
Ah.

[03:08:47.750 --> 03:08:47.750]

[03:08:50.270 --> 03:08:51.470]
Come on, everybody.

[03:08:52.790 --> 03:08:54.990]
I've been a left playing game.

[03:08:55.710 --> 03:08:58.050]
I bet you I can play the blame.

[03:08:58.490 --> 03:08:58.930]
Yeah.

[03:08:59.270 --> 03:09:00.450]
For the nasty hurricane.

[03:09:01.470 --> 03:09:02.090]
For the neighbors.

[03:09:02.670 --> 03:09:03.450]
For the neighbors.

[03:09:03.450 --> 03:09:04.130]
For the people who are cinnamon.

[03:09:04.810 --> 03:09:06.450]
For the first feed by a mom.

[03:09:08.590 --> 03:09:10.190]
For everybody playing.

[03:09:10.590 --> 03:09:10.990]
Megan.

[03:09:11.430 --> 03:09:11.910]
Megan.

[03:09:12.250 --> 03:09:12.690]
Go, Megan.

[03:09:12.850 --> 03:09:14.370]
But then if then go, fake in.

[03:09:14.490 --> 03:09:14.990]
Say, bye.

[03:09:15.190 --> 03:09:16.170]
I'll make it.

[03:09:16.290 --> 03:09:16.450]
Ah.

[03:09:17.350 --> 03:09:17.350]

[03:09:18.310 --> 03:09:20.390]
The blame game.

[03:09:20.390 --> 03:09:20.490]
Yeah.

[03:09:20.790 --> 03:09:21.130]
Yeah.

[03:09:23.330 --> 03:09:23.450]
Yeah.

[03:09:24.690 --> 03:09:26.290]
Who sounds like tomorrow?

[03:09:27.830 --> 03:09:28.310]
I don't know.

[03:09:28.690 --> 03:09:29.670]
Every time he sees me.

[03:09:29.690 --> 03:09:31.830]
It's the way God wants it to be.

[03:09:32.050 --> 03:09:34.810]
He wants to take the city and cover it to sleep.

[03:09:35.410 --> 03:09:35.930]
Renegant.

[03:09:37.130 --> 03:09:37.650]
Renegant.

[03:09:38.130 --> 03:09:38.650]
Renegant.

[03:09:39.130 --> 03:09:39.650]
Renegant.

[03:09:43.550 --> 03:09:46.250]
Curse he wants to make a new or a reason.

[03:09:47.410 --> 03:09:49.310]
And I don't care what people are saying.

[03:09:49.310 --> 03:09:50.810]
He sounds like Jesse Jefferson.

[03:09:51.070 --> 03:09:52.430]
We as black people.

[03:09:52.770 --> 03:09:53.930]
His comments are bizarre.

[03:09:54.470 --> 03:09:55.930]
Surely God is mad.

[03:09:56.390 --> 03:09:59.170]
He compares the vocals to a willy-want-a-faw.

[03:09:59.710 --> 03:09:59.830]
Shocked.

[03:10:00.170 --> 03:10:02.250]
He's making me mad.

[03:10:02.730 --> 03:10:04.150]
Yes, Renegant.

[03:10:04.510 --> 03:10:05.110]
He's making me mad.

[03:10:07.270 --> 03:10:07.870]
Renegant.

[03:10:07.870 --> 03:10:10.530]
Curse he wants to make a new or a reason.

[03:10:11.190 --> 03:10:11.490]
He's making me mad.

[03:10:13.250 --> 03:10:15.490]
It's time for us to come together.

[03:10:16.110 --> 03:10:19.210]
It's time for us to rebuild a new world

[03:10:19.210 --> 03:10:21.150]
as the one that should be.

[03:10:21.210 --> 03:10:24.150]
A town or way ever they are.

[03:10:24.710 --> 03:10:26.770]
This city will be chocolate.

[03:10:27.490 --> 03:10:28.830]
A chocolate new world.

[03:10:29.330 --> 03:10:30.850]
He never takes the blame.

[03:10:32.650 --> 03:10:34.810]
For anything that's chocolate.

[03:10:35.130 --> 03:10:36.010]
At the end of the day.

[03:10:36.210 --> 03:10:38.090]
That's how I'm putting in some positive angels.

[03:10:38.390 --> 03:10:39.370]
I want all theirs.

[03:10:39.730 --> 03:10:40.250]
Renegant.

[03:10:43.390 --> 03:10:43.990]
Renegant.

[03:10:44.610 --> 03:10:45.570]
No, I can.

[03:10:47.650 --> 03:10:48.050]
Renegant.

[03:10:48.130 --> 03:10:50.670]
He wants to make new or a reason.

[03:10:51.250 --> 03:10:53.890]
You can't have new or all theirs.

[03:10:54.030 --> 03:10:54.690]
No other way.

[03:10:55.230 --> 03:10:56.630]
It was the name of the wall.

[03:10:57.350 --> 03:10:59.610]
George Bush doesn't care about black people.

[03:10:59.690 --> 03:11:00.450]
That's the way it goes.

[03:11:00.770 --> 03:11:01.530]
Are you dark folks?

[03:11:01.730 --> 03:11:03.210]
The Republicans hate you like poison them.

[03:11:03.330 --> 03:11:04.890]
They'll do anything they're power to keep you from voting.

[03:11:05.270 --> 03:11:07.210]
And if you do vote, they'll make them sure it doesn't count anyway.

[03:11:07.630 --> 03:11:08.290]
Just the way it is.

[03:11:09.250 --> 03:11:10.290]
I lost your question, Tiger Woods.

[03:11:10.410 --> 03:11:11.010]
You got a lot of money.

[03:11:11.250 --> 03:11:12.870]
And then hopefully.

[03:11:12.870 --> 03:11:13.790]
Oh, God.

[03:11:14.010 --> 03:11:15.110]
He just, he makes me gag.

[03:11:15.410 --> 03:11:16.450]
He had just something about him.

[03:11:16.670 --> 03:11:16.730]
OK.

[03:11:16.970 --> 03:11:19.150]
So I don't know what this skin color and that kind of stuff.

[03:11:19.470 --> 03:11:21.330]
Because he's a little bit of this little laugh.

[03:11:21.610 --> 03:11:22.590]
He just, he's boring.

[03:11:23.330 --> 03:11:24.450]
Like golf in general.

[03:11:24.590 --> 03:11:25.030]
When you've regi.

[03:11:26.750 --> 03:11:27.110]
Absolutely.

[03:11:27.570 --> 03:11:27.590]
Sorry.

[03:11:27.710 --> 03:11:29.510]
I shouldn't have said that because Mad Dog's up there in Augusta

[03:11:29.510 --> 03:11:30.430]
for the Masters, right?

[03:11:30.670 --> 03:11:31.130]
We're with that.

[03:11:31.210 --> 03:11:31.830]
How about the Masters?

[03:11:31.890 --> 03:11:32.730]
Are we on QAM?

[03:11:33.810 --> 03:11:34.150]
Oh, sure.

[03:11:34.590 --> 03:11:35.090]
No, no.

[03:11:35.150 --> 03:11:35.250]
We're not.

[03:11:36.130 --> 03:11:38.650]
In fact, I'd rather watch bullying than watch golf.

[03:11:38.730 --> 03:11:40.970]
I'd rather watch two-pinch of bullying with Ernie.

[03:11:41.550 --> 03:11:42.410]
At the end of the game.

[03:11:42.410 --> 03:11:42.870]
Huh?

[03:11:43.150 --> 03:11:43.670]
That's a telephone.

[03:11:44.270 --> 03:11:44.630]
Koalix.

[03:11:44.870 --> 03:11:45.650]
What was his name?

[03:11:45.830 --> 03:11:46.490]
Eddie Koalix.

[03:11:47.370 --> 03:11:48.630]
And Carmen Selvino.

[03:11:48.970 --> 03:11:49.790]
And Buddy Bomar.

[03:11:50.870 --> 03:11:51.590]
Bob Bomar.

[03:11:51.710 --> 03:11:52.850]
I'd rather watch that than watch golf.

[03:11:52.950 --> 03:11:54.310]
Now you wouldn't watch golf on TV.

[03:11:54.510 --> 03:11:54.630]
Would you?

[03:11:55.150 --> 03:11:55.150]

[03:11:55.210 --> 03:11:56.610]
Anybody out there going to watch the Masters?

[03:11:56.610 --> 03:11:57.430]
I sure hope not.

[03:11:57.630 --> 03:11:59.290]
Because we'll come to your house and beat the crap out of you.

[03:11:59.510 --> 03:12:00.510]
We'll bring that woman to your house.

[03:12:00.590 --> 03:12:01.650]
It wants your CD fixed.

[03:12:02.790 --> 03:12:03.230]
And we'll lie.

[03:12:03.450 --> 03:12:05.290]
You remember in Clockwork Orange when they locked in in the room

[03:12:05.290 --> 03:12:07.670]
and the speakers were blasting from downstairs with the baits open?

[03:12:09.390 --> 03:12:10.730]
We'll lock you in a room with a,

[03:12:10.730 --> 03:12:14.930]
but with huge bow speakers right under your ass with her fetching.

[03:12:16.330 --> 03:12:17.210]
Like that.

[03:12:18.090 --> 03:12:20.790]
She is exactly what's wrong with women.

[03:12:21.030 --> 03:12:21.410]
Right, right there?

[03:12:21.530 --> 03:12:22.710]
She's well part of it anyway.

[03:12:25.570 --> 03:12:26.450]
Fetch nagging.

[03:12:30.750 --> 03:12:31.570]
5670560 pound.

[03:12:31.690 --> 03:12:34.250]
I bet she cooks up a mean batch of pasta, you think?

[03:12:35.630 --> 03:12:35.970]
I don't know.

[03:12:36.330 --> 03:12:37.210]
W.A.M. Hello.

[03:12:38.470 --> 03:12:38.910]
Neil.

[03:12:39.210 --> 03:12:39.750]
Yes, sir.

[03:12:40.170 --> 03:12:41.010]
In your opinion,

[03:12:41.810 --> 03:12:46.710]
should they have lengthened the rough instead of making the course harder at gusts up?

[03:12:46.850 --> 03:12:47.010]
I like it.

[03:12:47.010 --> 03:12:48.110]
Yeah, make it harder.

[03:12:49.090 --> 03:12:49.530]
Idiot.

[03:12:49.750 --> 03:12:50.490]
Lengthened the rough.

[03:12:50.590 --> 03:12:51.190]
Yeah, Lindy Ruff.

[03:12:51.230 --> 03:12:53.110]
He's not too happy with the Theresey Tucker.

[03:12:53.550 --> 03:12:55.650]
For Lindy, he's got his daughter's got that brain problem.

[03:12:55.650 --> 03:12:56.530]
All kinds of things going on.

[03:12:56.530 --> 03:12:57.490]
Good guy to Lindy Ruff.

[03:12:57.610 --> 03:12:58.210]
You know him now.

[03:12:59.110 --> 03:13:00.070]
Who was hockey?

[03:13:00.350 --> 03:13:02.690]
That thing about 34 people say hockey.

[03:13:03.150 --> 03:13:04.830]
The hockey knowledge in South Florida, man.

[03:13:04.830 --> 03:13:08.870]
You couldn't be a foot in a fumble and have room for Jail's ass inside.

[03:13:09.270 --> 03:13:11.170]
Up on the right side from Mike George.

[03:13:11.630 --> 03:13:13.190]
The right side is high and wide.

[03:13:13.370 --> 03:13:13.790]
I believe going.

[03:13:14.110 --> 03:13:15.930]
Go going from Jimmy Bowen.

[03:13:16.050 --> 03:13:16.770]
Remember Jimmy Bowen?

[03:13:16.850 --> 03:13:18.150]
I'm sticking with you on Relat Records.

[03:13:18.310 --> 03:13:18.830]
I bet you don't.

[03:13:19.310 --> 03:13:20.110]
Long before you time.

[03:13:20.450 --> 03:13:22.410]
Jimmy Bowen, he also, I think, got beat.

[03:13:22.690 --> 03:13:24.330]
Wasn't he the one who got to crafty out of him?

[03:13:26.170 --> 03:13:27.610]
In an alley in LA somewhere.

[03:13:27.790 --> 03:13:28.290]
I better look it up.

[03:13:28.430 --> 03:13:28.610]
I better.

[03:13:28.670 --> 03:13:28.770]
Who?

[03:13:32.490 --> 03:13:33.470]
Kick it that could know.

[03:13:36.410 --> 03:13:37.430]
No, no, wait a minute.

[03:13:37.450 --> 03:13:37.790]
I'm confused.

[03:13:38.310 --> 03:13:39.750]
No, no, no.

[03:13:40.910 --> 03:13:41.890]
What the hell was his name?

[03:13:42.010 --> 03:13:42.370]
Honeycomb?

[03:13:42.490 --> 03:13:43.010]
Who did Honeycomb?

[03:13:43.310 --> 03:13:43.790]
Jimmy Rogers.

[03:13:44.970 --> 03:13:46.150]
See, I should know that name.

[03:13:46.250 --> 03:13:46.510]
You know what?

[03:13:46.530 --> 03:13:47.370]
Oh, God.

[03:13:47.530 --> 03:13:48.290]
Even though it's a phony name.

[03:13:48.810 --> 03:13:49.370]
Jimmy Rogers.

[03:13:49.810 --> 03:13:51.770]
I would be surprised if it's in here in the little bio.

[03:13:52.450 --> 03:13:53.830]
Do you remember Honeycomb?

[03:13:54.790 --> 03:13:55.610]
You heard that song.

[03:13:55.970 --> 03:13:56.110]
Sure.

[03:13:57.670 --> 03:13:58.630]
Here's Shorty Rogers.

[03:13:58.870 --> 03:14:00.450]
Here's Kenny Rogers in the first edition.

[03:14:01.770 --> 03:14:06.150]
Let's see, Born 33 in Canvas, Washington, pop singer, guitarist, pianist.

[03:14:06.970 --> 03:14:09.550]
Poets at his own TV variety series in 1959, I remember that.

[03:14:10.410 --> 03:14:17.270]
Career handprint following mysterious assault on the San Diego Freeway on December 1, 1967 was left him with a fractured skull.

[03:14:18.270 --> 03:14:21.590]
He was kind of like, you know, remember Jan from Jan and Dean, or was it Dean?

[03:14:21.770 --> 03:14:22.950]
A little crash in his corvette.

[03:14:23.910 --> 03:14:24.350]
I don't recall.

[03:14:24.730 --> 03:14:25.450]
Oh my God.

[03:14:25.450 --> 03:14:30.150]
I saw that on biography channels enough to make you just want to scream, or Jan and Dean.

[03:14:30.530 --> 03:14:33.170]
Of course, there were no kind of Sam and Dean who were sleeping in the same room.

[03:14:33.510 --> 03:14:35.650]
This is Neil Rogers.

[03:14:36.610 --> 03:14:39.610]
This is 5.62.8.

[03:14:43.170 --> 03:14:44.510]
It's Dave O.

[03:14:44.690 --> 03:14:45.770]
If I am the town.

[03:14:46.330 --> 03:14:46.650]
Welcome.

[03:14:47.370 --> 03:14:48.650]
At 5.6.0.

[03:14:49.550 --> 03:14:50.450]
WQ.A.M.

[03:14:52.930 --> 03:14:56.190]
The Dota, the Dota, the Dota, the Dota.

[03:14:56.310 --> 03:14:58.250]
Go by, go by, go by.

[03:14:58.530 --> 03:15:00.830]
Your ship is caught in fire.

[03:15:01.990 --> 03:15:06.150]
Go by, go by, go with the dead.

[03:15:06.610 --> 03:15:07.930]
Must die.

[03:15:09.050 --> 03:15:14.010]
Oh yes, who may be the Dutch, but who has his way?

[03:15:14.550 --> 03:15:15.770]
Who will die?

[03:15:16.370 --> 03:15:18.770]
Who will make you die?

[03:15:18.770 --> 03:15:18.910]
Who will make you die?

[03:15:21.630 --> 03:15:26.810]
We've been inventing for a long time.

[03:15:28.050 --> 03:15:32.350]
With the bush-dry, travelling home.

[03:15:33.490 --> 03:15:38.730]
I asked what would be safer than an object,

[03:15:38.730 --> 03:15:42.030]
and prayed better with the suitcase.

[03:15:42.910 --> 03:15:44.530]
I'm on board.

[03:15:45.990 --> 03:15:48.550]
Who will die?

[03:15:48.910 --> 03:15:49.430]
Who will die?

[03:15:49.710 --> 03:15:51.030]
Who will die?

[03:15:52.870 --> 03:15:59.210]
And when you die, you get a free pass of thought.

[03:16:00.730 --> 03:16:02.570]
You're not a traveller.

[03:16:02.970 --> 03:16:04.930]
When those bombs explode,

[03:16:04.930 --> 03:16:10.410]
or two by, we will make you die.

[03:16:11.870 --> 03:16:13.770]
Who will die?

[03:16:13.810 --> 03:16:17.350]
And heaven, or ninety-debbin?

[03:16:19.930 --> 03:16:21.310]
When we now control,

[03:16:22.090 --> 03:16:23.930]
all the world are high.

[03:16:24.610 --> 03:16:27.030]
Cash, or ten, or three,

[03:16:27.370 --> 03:16:31.090]
were different to the function of two-way women.

[03:16:32.090 --> 03:16:35.630]
Under the stair, we will die.

[03:16:38.470 --> 03:16:43.730]
We've been inventing for a long time.

[03:16:44.890 --> 03:16:45.850]
We've been inventing for a long time.

[03:16:45.850 --> 03:16:49.490]
You're my life, of the old faith.

[03:16:52.050 --> 03:16:54.310]
You're not a traveller.

[03:16:54.490 --> 03:16:54.490]

[03:16:54.770 --> 03:16:58.130]
Who will die?

[03:16:58.130 --> 03:16:58.210]
Who will die?

[03:16:58.530 --> 03:16:59.670]
Who will die?

[03:17:04.530 --> 03:17:06.010]
What's the origin of that, by the way?

[03:17:07.030 --> 03:17:08.450]
That was a real call.

[03:17:09.330 --> 03:17:11.470]
Many years ago, many people died.

[03:17:14.070 --> 03:17:14.550]
And they died.

[03:17:15.010 --> 03:17:16.130]
Those were famous last words.

[03:17:17.510 --> 03:17:19.470]
But Al Pacino said it in the afternoon.

[03:17:19.830 --> 03:17:21.470]
That was just a dialogue in a movie.

[03:17:21.970 --> 03:17:23.930]
A third dialogue in the Godfather 3.

[03:17:25.550 --> 03:17:26.870]
Maybe they should fear you.

[03:17:28.350 --> 03:17:29.410]
1026 votes on the pole.

[03:17:29.510 --> 03:17:33.470]
Man, I am just astonished at the power of...

[03:17:34.530 --> 03:17:36.490]
You see, even though Eric tried to sandbag us,

[03:17:36.490 --> 03:17:38.130]
I think Eric's on the payroll across the street.

[03:17:38.930 --> 03:17:40.390]
Now, you're doing a fine job, Eric.

[03:17:40.430 --> 03:17:41.410]
It's just a joke. You're great.

[03:17:41.730 --> 03:17:42.110]
You're the best.

[03:17:42.370 --> 03:17:43.170]
That's what Josh said.

[03:17:43.710 --> 03:17:44.910]
He said, when it comes to that internet,

[03:17:45.410 --> 03:17:46.510]
Hygiene's Eric is the best.

[03:17:47.030 --> 03:17:47.490]
You know what you said?

[03:17:47.910 --> 03:17:48.590]
Something like that.

[03:17:48.590 --> 03:17:48.970]
Yeah.

[03:17:49.690 --> 03:17:51.570]
He said, send me the money, but Eric's the best.

[03:17:52.210 --> 03:17:53.770]
I'm going to start sending the check to Eric every month.

[03:17:53.810 --> 03:17:54.310]
He could use it.

[03:17:54.330 --> 03:17:55.430]
He's got a wife and kids' support.

[03:17:56.110 --> 03:17:57.390]
Punk like you, what do you need it for?

[03:17:57.790 --> 03:17:58.810]
Go out there and gamble it away.

[03:17:58.910 --> 03:17:59.710]
To slots or something.

[03:18:00.090 --> 03:18:00.690]
Booze, dope.

[03:18:01.130 --> 03:18:01.970]
Yeah, booze, dope.

[03:18:02.170 --> 03:18:03.070]
Women, all this content.

[03:18:03.730 --> 03:18:03.730]

[03:18:04.050 --> 03:18:04.170]
Right.

[03:18:04.970 --> 03:18:06.590]
Going to hockey game on Sunday.

[03:18:06.810 --> 03:18:08.210]
Going to see the Panthers in Tampa Bay.

[03:18:08.490 --> 03:18:10.590]
You wouldn't name me somebody on the Lightning real quick.

[03:18:12.910 --> 03:18:13.990]
What are you laughing about?

[03:18:14.830 --> 03:18:17.550]
That's the defending standing cup champion Tampa Bay Lightning.

[03:18:17.550 --> 03:18:18.190]
You name me somebody.

[03:18:18.390 --> 03:18:19.330]
I do know that though.

[03:18:19.510 --> 03:18:20.130]
I do know that one.

[03:18:20.350 --> 03:18:21.250]
Let's stay together.

[03:18:21.670 --> 03:18:21.670]

[03:18:21.990 --> 03:18:22.690]
Name me one player.

[03:18:23.250 --> 03:18:23.990]
How about number four?

[03:18:25.250 --> 03:18:25.550]
Vincent?

[03:18:26.790 --> 03:18:28.010]
No, there's no way, man.

[03:18:28.450 --> 03:18:28.770]
Look at that.

[03:18:29.030 --> 03:18:30.470]
How about number nine?

[03:18:30.550 --> 03:18:31.670]
Wait, don't they have a way?

[03:18:31.690 --> 03:18:32.130]
How about Brian?

[03:18:32.130 --> 03:18:32.630]
I have one.

[03:18:33.650 --> 03:18:37.750]
Isn't John, is that the best feature gear on their team or something?

[03:18:41.370 --> 03:18:41.770]
No.

[03:18:44.130 --> 03:18:45.950]
How about Martin St. Louis?

[03:18:45.950 --> 03:18:47.530]
Meet me in St. Louis, Louis.

[03:18:48.310 --> 03:18:51.410]
You just wait till I tell Joe Bell about the deal he's going to cook up for your ass.

[03:18:52.410 --> 03:18:53.910]
Oh, God, you just...

[03:18:53.910 --> 03:18:55.250]
Now, at least you're going as good.

[03:18:55.390 --> 03:18:56.150]
At least you're going out there.

[03:18:56.170 --> 03:18:56.810]
You've got a free ticket.

[03:18:57.850 --> 03:19:01.190]
You're going to take one of your relatives out there kind of into thinking that you're Mr. Sports.

[03:19:01.410 --> 03:19:01.710]
That's good.

[03:19:02.450 --> 03:19:04.930]
1023 votes on the pool of all the things that Neil talks about.

[03:19:05.070 --> 03:19:06.450]
Which is the most interesting to you.

[03:19:06.950 --> 03:19:08.470]
How about a pay raise for Josh and George?

[03:19:08.710 --> 03:19:09.070]
How about that?

[03:19:09.310 --> 03:19:10.150]
That's interesting to them.

[03:19:10.870 --> 03:19:13.570]
Politics for 72 inside radio stuff on 39.

[03:19:14.110 --> 03:19:14.990]
Religion 107.

[03:19:15.110 --> 03:19:17.070]
All you get skis out there, all you crazy people.

[03:19:17.830 --> 03:19:19.150]
I hate this pool 71.

[03:19:19.490 --> 03:19:20.010]
Jewish stuff.

[03:19:20.170 --> 03:19:20.650]
42.

[03:19:21.190 --> 03:19:21.870]
Rhymes with Jew.

[03:19:22.390 --> 03:19:22.890]
Food and restaurants.

[03:19:22.950 --> 03:19:24.130]
44, especially Delhi.

[03:19:24.570 --> 03:19:25.230]
Hockey 34.

[03:19:25.490 --> 03:19:26.050]
We likely story.

[03:19:26.430 --> 03:19:26.890]
Gay stuff.

[03:19:27.830 --> 03:19:28.310]
33.

[03:19:30.770 --> 03:19:32.810]
And Slats and Gamla, I'm especially with a good machine.

[03:19:33.450 --> 03:19:34.050]
20 doughs.

[03:19:34.090 --> 03:19:34.890]
Bye, bye, bye.

[03:19:35.130 --> 03:19:36.190]
When it comes to school.

[03:19:36.270 --> 03:19:36.730]
Day 29.
