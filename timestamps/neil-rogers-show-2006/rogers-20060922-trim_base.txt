[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]
Why are you first in?

[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.720]
Baby, launch a couple missiles

[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.200]
Ha, ha, ha!

[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.340]
To our place we know

[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.620]
And Amy, my mad-a-fell

[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.000]
Whose first name begins with us?

[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.520]
Ooooo!

[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.980]
There's one thing we all understand

[00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.900]
How data won't be finished

[00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.600]
Until we blow up Pakistan

[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.440]
We could chase around forever

[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.900]
With our legs and all our troops

[00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.280]
But special forces are some tired

[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.860]
Of jumping through them fools

[00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.820]
You know we need another plane

[00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.960]
So let's cut out all the nonsense

[00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.960]
To end all blow up Pakistan

[00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.340]
Whenever Casey's were up the monsters

[00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.440]
How can a need a nuclear tape

[00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.000]
I've never heard everybody about what your normally

[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.740]
Why don't we stop pussy food

[00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.660]
And blow up Pakistan

[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.280]
All right

[00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.140]
I guess we almost did

[00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.460]
Boom, boom

[00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.340]
So it's not bad enough when your enemy is like Hugo Chavez

[00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.860]
They're calling you the LDablo and stuff like that

[00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.060]
And an alcoholic and a piece of turd

[00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.160]
Nice call by the way Hugo

[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.080]
It's not bad enough but when you're supposed

[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.920]
It friends like Pervert Musharif are like sticking to you

[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.480]
President Pervert Musharif of Pakistan

[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.580]
Said yesterday that after the 9-11 attacks

[00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.620]
The U.S. threatened to bomb his country

[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.120]
If it didn't cooperate with the America's war

[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.640]
Campaign against the Taliban in Afghanistan man

[00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.100]
Musharif and the interview with CBS News magazine

[00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.120]
Showed 60 minutes that will air this Sunday

[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.060]
Don't miss that

[00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.120]
Said the threat came from Assistant Secretary of State Richard Armageddon

[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.260]
Don't call me Herman Ronson

[00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.180]
I hear all of them like Herman

[00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.820]
Who is the ballerier of Jackie Kuhn

[00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:02.640]
Uncle Fester

[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.160]
Yes, whatever

[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.040]
Flight by Jackie Kuhn

[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.320]
Very

[00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.040]
Came from Assistant Secretary of State Richard Armageddon

[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.600]
Was given to Musharif's intelligence director

[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.360]
The intelligence director told me that

[00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.780]
Armageddon said

[00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.840]
Be prepared to be bomb-dedited

[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.640]
Be prepared to go back to the Stone Age

[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.620]
Musharif be sent

[00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.020]
I think it was a very rude remark he said

[00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.760]
Ha ha ha

[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.080]
No

[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.600]
The Pakistani leader who's remarks were distributed to the media

[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.140]
By CBS said he reacted to the threat

[00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.400]
They're responsible way

[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.340]
One has to think and take actions in the interest of the nation

[00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.900]
That's what I did

[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.240]
He said about the cooperation extended by Pakistan

[00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.520]
Musharif said some demands made by the U.S. were ludicrous

[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.180]
Including one insisting he suppressed domestic expression of support for terrorism against the U.S

[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.840]
If somebody's expressing views we can't occurb the expression of views he said

[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.720]
Well, they just haven't learned enough I get from the Bush crowd

[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.100]
The American F and Way

[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.440]
Oh and he was armoured to send

[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.380]
I never made such a remark

[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.660]
I did have a long career right

[00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.700]
Like he just made that up

[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.540]
Like he's going to come here and make that up

[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.640]
You lying sack

[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.680]
How's Valerie playing to him by the way dick

[00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.060]
My God

[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.540]
This is this is the guy who put uh I can't say it

[00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.020]
I was going to say put in

[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.000]
But I can't say they want him

[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.860]
Putting putter yeah he putting in there

[00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.020]
Guess what book is number one on amazon.com I already told you

Hegemony or survival

[00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.460]
But why do I keep saying that

[00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.980]
I don't know

[00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.780]
Hegemony or survival american quest for global dominance

[00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.740]

[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.000]
No you said 12,000 yesterday

[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.460]
No I didn't

[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.040]
And you did not I did not

[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.040]

[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.840]
85 million and now it's number one

[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.780]
So paperback you can get it for $7.80 from amazon.com

[00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.620]
They are the best product

[00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.240]
They're great

[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.500]
Love amazon

[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.940]
Yeah they are

[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:39.180]
Don't you?

[00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.860]
I love it

[00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:40.880]
I heard it from them all the time

[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.360]
Ordinous thing on Wednesday night

[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.320]
And unfortunately I got to hear this morning 930

[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.800]
Was there

[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.540]
Hegemony or survival american quest for global dominance

[00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.900]
The American

[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.420]
When a Noem Chomsky book can be number one on the best cell

[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.480]
Of the thanks to Hugo Chavez

[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.420]
That's unbelievable

[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.780]
That is amazing

[00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.440]
I mean most americans wouldn't know

[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.940]
Noem Chomsky from Noah with the arc

[00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.080]
The old man with the old drunk

[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.040]
Whoop right

[00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.620]
Yeah

[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.540]
Unbelievable

[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.880]
And all kinds of good stuff today

[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.280]
This business about the

[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.380]
Joe Gerardi getting canned because of the

[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.640]
Yeah and then Dave Hyde

[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.500]
Yeah you people are such a bunch of suck ups

[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.340]
It makes me sick

[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.100]
I read Dave Hyde's column in the Sun

[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.740]
Settled us morning

[00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.880]
Well this is what they had to do

[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.080]
And there's no other way

[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.300]
And Larry Beanstock

[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.960]
And the

[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.320]
And Jeffrey Luria

[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.700]
Yeah

[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.120]
Guy comes in there with the lowest payroll in baseball

[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.380]
Puts in a hell of a run

[00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.220]
Damn near and still isn't officially limited

[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.360]
And they won last night against

[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.460]
With the series with the Metz

[00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.820]
How come they only got

[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.060]
Is this schedule correct?

[00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.860]
I don't think so

[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.080]
Can this be right Josh?

[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.480]
It's got

[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.860]
Yes

[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.380]
They play the Phillies

[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.260]
And then the brave

[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.060]
It braves on Sunday

[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.540]
Yeah

[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.140]
What kind of a schedule is that?

[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.460]
Who made that schedule up?

[00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.260]
Crazy person

[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.360]
But anyway it's a

[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.620]
They got the two big games tonight

[00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.060]
To Margins

[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.160]
The Philphodophia Phillies

[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.640]
And that that'll

[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.220]
I guess

[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.760]
Because the Phillies are one of the two teams

[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.540]
They got to hop over

[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:49.660]
Dodgers and Phillies right

[00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.460]
That's correct

[00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.220]
But anyway comes in here with this bunch of kids

[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.320]
There's a phenomenal job

[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.660]
And because you know

[00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.360]
They told Jeffrey Luria to shut up

[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.620]
And it wasn't him that said it anyway

[00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.660]
Who the hell was it?

[00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:59.560]
One of the coaches

[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.880]
I don't know about that

[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.800]
Well whatever in hell

[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.860]
Will you better start

[00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.200]
Catching up on your Marlon's trivia

[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.420]
Just in case they make the wild

[00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.560]
I don't know about that

[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.080]
Like it

[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.180]
Well it's in our

[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.900]
Raffle anyway today

[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:09.960]
I do my reading

[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:10.820]
I do my homework

[00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.960]
And Joe Gerardi is going to get candy

[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.280]
Is not going to be back next year

[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.320]
And go to the show

[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.280]
Nice job you're fired

[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.020]
You jackass Jeffrey Luria

[00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.100]
We hate you like poison

[00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.940]
And if anybody else wants the Marlon games

[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:21.500]
They're all yours

[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.020]
We couldn't give him away this year

[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.260]
Speaking of couldn't give him away

[00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.900]
All I talked there at the end of that sports show

[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:26.720]
We have in the morning about

[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.440]
The dolphins and the little girls

[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.580]
Tennessee team their plan

[00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.220]
Josh is trying to give away tickets

[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.100]
Are you still doing that or is that over with now?

[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.340]
Well yeah

[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.660]
I'm still trying I guess

[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.020]
I'm wqm.com

[00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.240]
Which he's in charge of that horse ball

[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.380]
Website trying to improve it

[00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.180]
And bring it up to speed

[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.700]
Certainly will never be like ours

[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:42.280]
But nevertheless

[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.300]
And so we

[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.260]
Trying to give away some tickets to the dolphin

[00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.380]
Titan game

[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.020]
Thought he had given away four pair

[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.860]
Which isn't very much

[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:49.400]
And then

[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.700]
And you say all four the winners said

[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:52.540]
Guess what

[00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.440]
We can't use them

[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.220]
That's correct

[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.640]
Different reasons

[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.320]
But uh

[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.500]
Yeah pretty much

[00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.940]
They gave me an I'm all set

[00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.420]
That is shocking

[00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.720]
Well they're O and two

[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.540]
Don't forget that

[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:03.120]
Yeah

[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.000]
There were two and O

[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.380]
You know

[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.880]
Yeah but this is for free

[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.560]
Free

[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.360]
Of course they probably have to pay for their own parking

[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.640]
Right

[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.060]
Well one guy had a full beer

[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.220]
Because they were in the upper deck

[00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:12.140]
I see

[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.940]
Oh no words you couldn't afford the binoculars

[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:14.640]
That's right

[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.680]
So that goes to show you the tremendous interest

[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.900]
And then I see the article yesterday

[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.360]
Oh look at the big headline

[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.560]
The game is sold out

[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.360]
It won't be blacked out

[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.740]
Like we're supposed to be proud about that

[00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.460]
What a horse and buggy phony baloney time

[00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:26.760]
It's always been that way

[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.460]
It always will

[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.980]
There's no point in even talking about it

[00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:29.520]
Because it you know

[00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.080]
That's just what it is

[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.460]
Like talking about the Democrats

[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.540]
Being a bunch of weak sisters

[00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.860]
You know

[00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.720]
There's no point in lamenting that

[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.280]
Because they're not

[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.380]
They're not going to wake up

[00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:38.760]
Monday morning and grow a pair of balls

[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.660]
Even Nancy Pelosi

[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.680]
She had a viral pair from Donnar Shalili

[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.080]
Good God

[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.860]
Hugo Chavez

[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.080]
There are all these world leaders

[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.400]
And of course he got applauded

[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.960]
And a standing ovation at the UN

[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.880]
Because that's the way the rest of the world feels

[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.040]
About these Nazis

[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.480]
And the O-Nazis we got running America now

[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.260]
And the way that they're running roughshod over the world

[00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:56.540]
And killing all these innocent people

[00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.080]
And threatening and brow beating

[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.580]
No and here's a Charlie Rangel on it

[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.680]
And we got lucky yesterday

[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.080]
Ponsed it up just as he was saying that

[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.400]
I thought he was going to say something else

[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.820]
But it turned out to work down

[00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.720]
No it was lucky that we got him to say that

[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.180]
And then Pelosi on her later

[00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.900]
Oh you don't come to our country

[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.420]
And the to rip our president

[00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:14.140]
Yeah right

[00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:14.560]
Why not

[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.420]
Because it's too much of the truth

[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.900]
And they haven't got the balls to do it

[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:18.820]
I have no idea

[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.340]
Oh I see it embarrassing them

[00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.300]
Yeah it embarrassed the fact that he actually had the co-hones to say it

[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.040]
And they just don't have the guts to do it

[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.120]
Democratic party man is evil

[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:27.640]
Evil

[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.100]
Not as evil as John McCain

[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:29.520]
But evil

[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.980]
I got to calm about this

[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:31.400]
So

[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.820]
Oh so good

[00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.280]
So good that even people that hate my reading on the ear

[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.740]
Will just they'll be sitting there with a radio cranked up so loud to be

[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.820]
They'll have their finger in it and the radio too

[00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.100]
Here's our poll from yesterday

[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.000]
I know all and by the way

[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.600]
Today's poll is going to change at 11

[00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:45.980]
I want to thank Deb

[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:46.760]
That was Deb's poll

[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.400]
It's a good poll but not one I want to leave on there all weekend long

[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:49.860]
You know what I'm saying

[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:50.860]
What do you call it?

[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:51.340]
The other one is

[00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:52.800]
No it's right in line with that kind of

[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.580]
And we do have 800 votes on there already

[00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.540]
But anyway yesterday 1610 5 vote

[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.700]
Which is pretty amazing considering that nobody's listing anymore

[00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.560]
Because I don't take those great calls no more

[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:01.860]
Hey

[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:02.720]
Yeah

[00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.320]
Is there any other ones?

[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.200]
No I guess that's it

[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:05.880]
Jargis Gay

[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:06.720]
And that's that's it

[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.860]
Well what's the point wasting my time with that crap

[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.180]
I mean if these idiots

[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:13.020]
They got something more interesting to say than I do

[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.160]
Then they should be paying me all this money to do this show every day

[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:15.880]
That's a good point

[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:16.600]
Yeah

[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.100]
The day that the South Florida audience has got something more compelling

[00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.700]
To talk about or to say that I got

[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.580]
Is the day that I order freaks and geeks

[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:24.540]
Oh it's right here

[00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:25.800]
No I don't know

[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.120]
I read the reviews on there

[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.100]
And I just looked at the demographics on IMDB

[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.260]
And even the old fart's

[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.000]
They gave it 9s and 10s

[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.080]
I thought it was a great series

[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.860]
But I look at the cover here

[00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:35.420]
And I see it

[00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:37.020]
It's a bunch of punky little kids

[00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:38.120]
Ew

[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:39.240]
These are

[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.240]
And when they all look like Robots Reaper

[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.400]
They want to keep me out those nasty glasses on

[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:43.640]
Oh

[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.820]
She's got what the plastic frames the geek glasses

[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:46.400]
Right

[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.580]
I mean that's why I guess why it's called freaks and geeks

[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:49.100]
Like that

[00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.340]
But James Franco is in it

[00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.780]
And there he is looking like him

[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.700]
Anyway yesterday I know all I need to know about

[00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.880]
Somebody if they vote Republican 565

[00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:58.620]
We hate you

[00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.460]
I believe O.J. is innocent 264

[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.780]
Demi the Holocaust 232

[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.580]
Like your buddy asked my Dina Jod

[00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:06.140]
Well I just

[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.140]
There's almost something sexual about Sane

[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:08.840]
I mean you're like

[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.940]
It's sort of a complicate

[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:10.860]
We don't know what I'm

[00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:11.880]
Ask my Dina Jod

[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:12.780]
They can pull it off

[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:14.520]
Where religious hench ear

[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.420]
149 speaking of religious getchies

[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:18.480]
Homestchool their kids 149

[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.480]
I hate this poll only 54

[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.500]
3.3% is pretty low for you bastards

[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.560]
Speak with a list

[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:24.160]
45

[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:25.620]
Watch the

[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.360]
Watch the view 47

[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.760]
I think a lot of the guys who watch the youth speak with a list

[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.660]
Listen to sports talk 44

[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.360]
Now see that should have had much much more

[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.040]
But then again it's

[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:34.460]
You know this

[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.100]
This radio station

[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.760]
Call radio talk show is 39

[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.920]
Or vote for Ralph Nader only 15

[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.640]
And that's how many votes I think you got anywhere

[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:43.220]
Right

[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.480]
Something like that at least in our crowd

[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.900]
So I don't know maybe I'll enjoy freaks and geeks

[00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.520]
There's how many CDs I say in here

[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.520]
There's like six or eight or something like that

[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.340]
Oh god

[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.240]
Fuel humility didn't degrade

[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.840]
I don't have to I don't have to talk about it

[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.520]
I don't have to admit that I ordered it

[00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.260]
And it's sitting right here and I saw what it is

[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.680]
I'm not even sure what it is

[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.760]
Anyway here's today's poll

[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.840]
And it's going to be a better vote on it real quick

[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:04.660]
You got an hour

[00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:05.780]
Until 11

[00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:06.920]
Thank heaven 411

[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.840]
I see Eric doesn't have the other one on her yet

[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:09.620]
Tell me good with it

[00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.660]
No he's not responding to my little

[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.000]
Oh Eric's not in touch

[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.260]
Maybe during the break you better call his phone

[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:16.580]
Or maybe he's sleeping in today

[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.860]
Yeah I tried that but I'll keep trying

[00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:19.700]
What do you mean by that?

[00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:20.740]
Others he's nice and my phone

[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:21.840]
I've been calling him

[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.020]
I see

[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.460]
See I don't want to go into it

[00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:26.740]
If Josh could change the poll

[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.560]
Then we wouldn't need to be dependent on waiting for fed Eric to get out of

[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.240]
The sack or get out of jail or urban hell he is

[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.120]
Maybe he hasn't really morning date at the parliament house with John Revolta

[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.280]
We have 811 votes on today's poll

[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.620]
Where do you get most of your news?

[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.460]
The internet 377 excellent

[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:41.360]
That includes our website

[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.300]
I didn't break him down because there's a two-metre damn any websites

[00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:44.700]
Right?

[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.100]
Right

[00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.580]
Neil show 117

[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:47.180]
Well good for you

[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:48.620]
We're very newsy these days

[00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:49.400]
Very newsy

[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.840]
News paper 95

[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.340]
Local TV 51

[00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.240]
CNN 42

[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.580]
MSNBC 28

[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.680]
You better get with the Keith Holberman Show

[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:57.300]
Damn it

[00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.680]

When's the last time we changed one in the middle of the show

[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:22.840]
Maybe a month ago

[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:23.740]
Months ago

[00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.080]
He'd like under the little room

[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.620]
But maybe he's in another little room

[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:27.920]
For how long?

[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:28.620]

Also known as KISS Country might have heard rap music on the radios

[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.980]
That's because according to detectives, a pirate radio station was interfering with the

legitimate station signal

[00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.820]

WKIS engineers

[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:56.080]
Oh

[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:01.000]
Track the pirate signal to the Okamo trailer park on tap street and contacted the BS

[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:01.200]
Oh

[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.880]
The detectives went to the trailer park Wednesday found a 30-foot tall

[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:05.980]
But third man

[00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:09.220]
Broadcasting antenna outside the trailer at 17 loop road

[00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:13.360]
The owner of the trailer, Darren Sadder, was arrested and charged with unauthorized transmission

[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.840]
Slash interference with a public radio station

[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.900]
State law prohibits interference with a licensed estacion

[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:22.400]
It convicted Sadder 34 could spend up to five years in prison

[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.840]
And be required to pay a $5,000 fine

[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.780]
The detectives said Sadder told the police in his firing dish jockey

[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:29.180]
He always wanted to be on the airways

[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:31.240]
Well, that's great, but you know, get a job

[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.060]
Notice it starts some kind of a stupid ass pirate station

[00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:37.180]
This obsession that some people have with these pirate stations, you know

[00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:40.760]
Yeah, I mean some of the stations in the market like KISS actually have a license

[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.140]
I mean we don't, but they do

[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.180]
Well, maybe that's the new way to go now

[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:46.480]
No, it's not the new way, yeah, go straight to jail

[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.400]
You know, not collect $200 and that pass go

[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.880]
So I mean, so happy Russia, Shauna, happy New Year will play all those

[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:52.880]
Both of those bits

[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.060]
Eric cut the new poll, it will be ready to switch by

[00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:59.060]
Okay, don't panic here, George is just he's giving you a lot of crap again like you're doing

[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.600]
Hello, I'm the general manager of this radio station

[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.720]
And today is Russia, Shauna, the Jewish New Year

[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:10.420]
In an effort to celebrate the religious diversity and promote goodwill toward other faiths

[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:15.500]
We've brought in a member of the Jewish community to offer our Jewish listeners a greeting for the new year

[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.800]
Hey, hey, happy New Year

[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:22.720]
Hey, hey, that's it, go home, okay, okay, everything

[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:27.440]
Anyway, and I would never I would last thing I would ever do is read a column by Michael Medved

[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:34.380]
Oh, self-hating right wing Jew, I mean, oh, supposedly a movie commentator, but just the most evil right wing

[00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:39.020]
He makes uh, who's that other guy? Michael, uh, the other Schmuck Savage

[00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:44.300]
Okay, he makes him seem like a liberal, and that's how obnoxious this guy is with his family values

[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:47.520]
And Hollywood with their perversion this guy's a jackass, but

[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:52.440]
The article is about a poll that they took so he can't really, you know, it's not really much commentary

[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.820]
He says with all the recent talk about anti-Semitism

[00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:57.080]
Who would have thought that Jews approved to be so popular?

[00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:00.500]
A new Gallup poll that just came out September 7, couple weeks ago

[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:05.660]
Act respondents how they felt about 10 different religious groups ranging from fundamentalist Christians to atheists

[00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.940]
By every measure guess who drew the most favorable reaction

[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:15.960]
Muslims I'm kidding Jews right highest positive rating 58% and lowest negative rating only 4%

[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.560]
See unlike in israeli as used in america even though there may be one dimensional

[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:23.420]
But uh in as far as politics, but uh, now they actually aren't

[00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:26.100]
We got your Ben Ginsburg and you got your uh David what's his name?

[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.140]
Horowitz right and wolfowitz and uh

[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:33.980]
By contrast americans express decadently mixed feelings about Mormons with a net negative rating

[00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:36.840]
29 to 28% and most of them is 30

[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:44.860]
26% negative the least popular religious groups in the survey proved to be atheists and overwhelmingly negative 40-50% rating

[00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:51.780]
And most especially Scientologists a stunning 53% negative to just 11% positive he says thank you time crews

[00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:53.080]
How do you like that?

[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:58.300]
You know that more than the Mormons are getting a bad rap that's because they never met any

[00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.500]
They're very clean they dress nicely

[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:05.600]
Right white shirts and ties very polite nice bicycles right they'll have sex with you

[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:14.200]
Sure, they look good right even if you don't right, but 44% negative with atheists and just it's a 15% positive

[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.200]
Well, yeah, what I really couldn't cure less

[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:17.660]
Who gives a crap?

[00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:22.860]
But that's kind of interesting see a lot of the Jews are oh gee they're always picking on us while they like you now

[00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.620]
Okay, how do you like that they like you?

[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:29.280]
But like you made a very good point that is that the Jews in israel there's much more there's much more

[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:36.240]
The vision of opinion politically and socially in israel among the Israelis than there is an emergent among American Jews

[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:40.020]
The American Jews are so paranoid like if you pick israel you're a pick on poor littles

[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:44.840]
Real you an anti-Semite and if you don't agree with everything they do you are miserable anti-Semite including me and you and whatever

[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.460]
And of course speaking of anti-Semite

[00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:51.380]
Our relationship is more than just yeah, there you go. Oh, yeah his partnership with Pakistan has saved lives

[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:54.360]
He's there with the eye shot Mocheroff. I don't see Mocheroff

[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.220]
Maybe they shot him after he made those comments yesterday

[00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:01.820]
But is it kind of bad timing though? Can you you can probably cut the tension in the air in that room with a butter knife

[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:07.640]
When you think I could cut it far. Yeah, you could cut it and bush would say oh what's that somebody just farted

[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:10.960]
He would say right in the middle of his kind of likes the part of that's correct

[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.540]
But only to the new reporters catch him off guard likes to blow him a little kiss

[00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:17.560]
I was speaking to country kiss so poor Joe Bellman

[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:22.740]
He's got source with that and of course we got the Cuban interference on our signal on our beautiful hd radio signal

[00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:23.020]
I

[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:28.280]
interference all the time so that's one of the problems with radio

[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:33.020]
But wasn't it comforting yesterday to read that thing about satellite radio is like taking a big dump

[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:36.080]
Yeah, it's the next time and it's like they kind of peaked out now

[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.460]
It's uh, maybe maybe or maybe a year from now won't even be around

[00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:43.660]
Maybe that's why those rumors were starting about Howard coming back to terrestrial radio for ABC

[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:51.080]
857 votes on our pool today 864 and like I said, we're gonna change it. Let's see. He's got a no. Hey, there it is

[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.260]
Got the new one on there

[00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:58.640]
It doesn't have a name yet. He's working on it's a working progress. Where was he if you say was he? No, he did not say

[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:05.280]
Oh, that's probably none of our business. I did that. We want to know if he was like still out there at the parliament house or whatever the problem was

[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:10.140]
Speaking of a good old time religion. I got I have so much good stuff today. It just makes me want to vomit

[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:14.980]
And isn't that something about that? No, I'm chomsky book. It's number one. Hegeveni

[00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:18.360]
I've said that word a million times you're meeting these articles. Nobody ever uses that word

[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:23.500]
You know in like day-to-day language and now that it's the book is big now. I can't say it

[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:27.360]
You say up my dinner. Dad like it's nothing. Well, yeah, but I practiced on that

[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:32.440]
Did you just got through Sanit? I'm he knew John that wasn't the first time. Yeah, off mood

[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:40.140]
Oh boy, must mood and off mood and off to lever. Well, it's just what a world

[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:46.280]
It's a sick effect. That's another reason to watch Tristan and his old forget about whether she didn't look on like good

[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:51.380]
What was her name again? I forget I forget I forget about yet she's me. Well, even Joshua to be she would know nothing special

[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:56.060]
What she you think? No, that really she was kind of plain jenny. He was much much prettier than her

[00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:57.520]
James uh Franco

[00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:02.740]
But another reason to watch it and the end of the word they would say well that's in medieval times and they yeah right

[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:07.720]
So you know what the only difference is that we got bigger and better and more effective weapons now

[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:11.660]
That's more dangerous. We can kill a whole lot more people in a much shorter time

[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:14.180]
The biggest name is the best talent

[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:14.920]
This is

[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.320]
For 205

[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:25.720]
By 50 W. You are the presents who did mo with mo

[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:34.420]
Now you listen to me. I've got unfinished business with that. They were not about I acted I stand before you now

[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:41.060]
With my previous they've been plainly in hand in it. There ain't no national god in Iraq. See national god

[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:47.080]
But I mean now I'm doing my thing here

[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.720]
I'm not going ahead now square

[00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:54.880]
No, it was I know yeah and another thing

[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.760]
Who's the goal for the war in Iraq?

[00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.340]
Kindle because Air Force or Joe Cain's in a pit helmet

[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:01.980]
Ah, well that's pit

[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:03.740]
Joyce as in

[00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:04.760]
Pith

[00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:12.920]
Nobody knows what I said anyway, but don't stop me now. I'm on fire dad like Stizzy cats. Why I'm the schizzy

[00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:16.740]
Now on a place in a note this new life of Leia

[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:24.060]
Ain't bad. Why I'll have you know I'm now the hot rob of skeletal women by the pool. They yeah, they like my nice back

[00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:25.860]
I got a play of strip my shot

[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:32.200]
But I want to tell you this puzzle like my jerk off and drag

[00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:40.420]
Sorry, I still got it. I bet you wish I had me back. Well not any other life

[00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.480]
Oh, yeah, you'll ever see me and I smelly dumb again see

[00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:49.640]
So I'm waiting well, oh sorry, well, was that right about those pictures named power one good god

[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:53.060]
And I'm just I'm delighted about the Janis to consider one because I hate her

[00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:57.580]
What about Farah though? Oh poor Farah deal on the witch that's you know

[00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:02.240]
I can at least that the one picture was worse than the current picture

[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:06.780]
And what about for the about three pages from the back? What was it? I was I can't even forget what I was I was trying to like

[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:14.040]
Steery to look at yesterday three pages in the back of the magazine back in the fish mine out of the garbage here and look myself

[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:18.720]
Not Diane Sawyer and Hillary was at it. I don't know. Yeah, I think that might have been it

[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:22.900]
Hillary's out of the laboratory. I better fish it on go fishing Bob new heart. She's death

[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:29.160]
Thanks marking the cars. Yeah, there's the global and so you maybe that was it to think about swore

[00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:34.800]
Oh, yeah, the picture Diane Sawyer she looked like a not a a witch

[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:39.540]
They look very similar in these pictures. Yes, it's rather shrewish not sure but sure

[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:44.600]
Back in the garbage anyway speaking of garbage. I saw movie last night

[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.120]
I thought all during the movie I thought well I'm gonna come on tomorrow and

[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:52.100]
Rave about this and recommend everybody out of see it and probably a lot of you did see it because it's a 2006 movie

[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:56.380]
I can't believe how just like mall I'm so hip and up to date now. I haven't seen two

[00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:00.400]
2006 movies in two nights. You're a ding dong daddy

[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.340]
Tristan and his old on Wednesday and then last night

[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.680]
Silent Hill. Oh, I'm sorry

[00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:11.180]
Me too. It's so funny. I saw that last weekend really go all through this

[00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:14.720]
Now it was an impulse because when I go to this store to buy in DVD and you know me

[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:17.660]
I'm an impulsive guy and I look around. I don't want to just buy one you know

[00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:20.260]
I want to buy like four or five sure and

[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:25.260]
I happen to see this and we say no prominently displayed recent releases or pocket in best sellers

[00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:30.080]
Whatever and I read the blurb about it in the sounded like my kind of movie, you know, pretty interesting

[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:35.520]
So I watched the movie last night. Now I don't know about you because both of you have seen it during the course of the movie

[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:40.420]
I'm thinking to myself what is this really uh and there were a couple of points that there were like the hair stood up on the back of my neck

[00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:41.880]
There were a couple of really scary moments

[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:46.960]
Like the one thing where that shrewish bitch in the church. He's a once you open up the locket and show the picture

[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:52.600]
You're right. She's a white man. She's a white man. Boy, just jolt most jumped up off the sofa. Yeah

[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.120]
And then you get to the ending and you can't complain about it because just like so many times there isn't any

[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:07.660]
And what was that after after two hours of all that yeah blood and guts and all those grotesque creatures and crawling bugs and thugs and

[00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:12.280]
And then we get to the ending and it's like uh, what just happened there. That's the end. That's it. We're done

[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:17.300]
We don't want to make them my right. Yeah. That's too common. Why don't things Josh even like beyond that

[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.780]
Oh the movie was pretty bad. I mean in general

[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:25.880]
Was a very entertaining walking around here. It's kind of like playing the video game you walk around and nothing happens

[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:29.920]
Well, say I never did play the video and it was based on the video game. I didn't tell you

[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.980]
It's just like the movie you walk around with ashes falling and nothing's going on

[00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:35.280]
Yeah, that's one thing if you're into ashes man

[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:39.240]
You'll love this movie because there are ashes falling the whole movie and it never never stops all the

[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:47.120]
Never stops. I still didn't like it. Yeah, and then I still don't get to think about the the cop that stopped the husband from going on in there

[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:52.080]
Well, what was his story? There was one scene I must have missed it was he one of them the half dead or something

[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:55.140]
I don't know what that was all about. I don't remember that. I do

[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:59.460]
vaguely and also what I don't understand is how come he wasn't picking up the phone

[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:03.760]
She was calling him back after the other car broke down and she's calling him back on a cell phone

[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:08.300]
He's listening to the message. I wasn't answering the phone because they're there. They don't work in silent

[00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:13.380]
Oh, phones don't work in silent here. Right. I see now you're right

[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:18.640]
It's so so if you want to see it and waste a couple hours and you want maybe a couple of scary moments fine, but it's just

[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:23.860]
Disappointing disappointing. It's like that mean creep thing. I saw a couple weeks ago

[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:29.820]
Although that movie was pretty had chance to be pretty good and interesting story all the way through and then the ending again

[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:35.220]
There wasn't any there was no ending. Why is it that directors and writers? They don't know how to end a movie

[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:39.700]
What's the story with I don't know, but it's the the plague of my life. It is true

[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:44.020]
Now I trust and as old it was on a sad ending, but just like Romeo and Juliet

[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:47.420]
You know, it was gonna be sad at least at least she didn't die. Oh, I shouldn't have said that

[00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:51.200]
I mean look anybody knows what I'm waiting for anybody expecting

[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:55.060]
I mean after all he went through and there in the fact that he was still alive that late to the movie

[00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:58.520]
It was a miracle. You know look it's medieval time so they're all gonna understand back to health

[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:02.240]
I want to lay down make it next to my regular part. I said it's medieval time. So they're all dead

[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:06.600]
Speaking of a good old-time religion man. This is it's just so sweet

[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:07.980]
Palo, Indonesia

[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:14.900]
Christian mobs torched cars blockaded roads and looted Muslim owned shops in violence touched off by today's

[00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:18.620]
Executions of three Roman Catholics convicted of instigating attacks on Muslims

[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:22.800]
Some 200 inmates escaped after moms assaulted a jail in the town of Adam

[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:27.500]
Amboa sending guards fleeing to the nearby jungle. Hegemoni

[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:35.740]
Five yeah by midday only 20 have been recaptured deputy national police chief lieutenant general adang

[00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:40.640]
Durod Chattun see I didn't make any difference how I see these names because nobody has any who these people are

[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:43.940]
Calling on the others to turn themselves in and on the island of forest

[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:47.540]
I wonder if that's like David for is the jockey the executed men's birthplace

[00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:52.100]
Machete wielding mobs ran through the streets Friday sending women and children running in panic police and witnesses said

[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:53.440]
Maybe one of them might have been OJ

[00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:58.500]
Police immediately reports at least five people were hurting including a prosecutor was hospitalized with stab wounds

[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:03.500]
Vice President juiced off Kala appeal for calm saying the deaths of the three maddened nothing to do with religion

[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:08.480]
Right, it's a matter of law. He told reporters in the capital of Jakarta if the people resent the law

[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:13.620]
We are doomed to did it he said the men were taken before the firing squad at 12 15 this morning

[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:18.920]
Said a senior police officer wise not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media family members later

[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:20.960]
Said they received confirmations of the deaths

[00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:28.000]
Paul Paul who were the execution to place was largely calm with thousands of police standing on streets corners and guarding markets and churches

[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.480]
But violence flared in the other villages were hundreds of Christians rampaged after running up the death

[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:37.460]
So that's just a muzzle and you pissed off a rampage of old craze in the streets. It's also the good Christians

[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:41.920]
Yeah, not that they would ever do that in northern Ireland for example

[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:46.640]
Where they have those protested marching days where they all dress up in orange like a bunch of silly people and they mill of them

[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.820]
He marched through the Catholic neighborhoods to piss them off

[00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:53.820]
That's right and invite them to throw rocks and stones and get all bed out of shape and like get out the armor again

[00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:58.240]
You know I might think go back to that least that was looked like pretty interesting. That's right. It's very violent

[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.040]
But it sure as hell was a very very

[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:04.940]
More fun to watch than hand grenades. Yeah, that's right very entertaining

[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:09.280]
Let's get the armor and the swords and the bow's and arrows and the thing in that movie about

[00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:13.500]
Most amazing is that these guys are getting like arrows in the back

[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:16.580]
And they they just reach and pull right out. They're just macho guys man

[00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:20.880]
They're gonna stop me with some of the fancy arrow or some slice of my hand off

[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:25.440]
We just keep marching along. I mean even right there at the end of the movie when Tristan gets you know

[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:30.220]
Then the night in the chest he just pulls that baby right out and the blood is pouring out

[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:35.420]
And he goes right on there and he holds up that Schminder's head into the crowd. I see I go. Yeah, all right

[00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:36.580]
Yeah, that's right

[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:40.540]
He was he was he was much more resilient than the uh, the cranky guy

[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:45.300]
Yeah, see the cranky guy he pulled the thing out of his chest and oh he died, you know

[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:51.180]
But this guy Tristan he pulled that knife that big big sword out of his chest and he just kept plotting right along man

[00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:55.580]
Nobody was gonna keep a good man down like that damn it like to try though

[00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:59.620]
9008 votes. We're gonna have a pretty hefty number, but we will change it 11 o'clock

[00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:02.680]
Or anything we ought to go to a thousand. It's up to you. Oh, what I don't really care

[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.600]
Huh, I think we should change it 11

[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:08.620]
This is very and even the other polls I would say that I want to really sexy or controversial pull

[00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:14.300]
But it's kind of interesting. What is Bush and Mochera? Yeah in the hunt together. What you want the person if at all

[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:17.360]
We confront him if at all we find out his location

[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:22.880]
We are quite clear what to do. So let's not get involved in how we roll be done

[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.940]
Wow, but you like a parliament light on this total

[00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:27.800]
Coordination at parliament

[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:28.160]
Intelligence

[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:33.660]
I mean the truth. I think there's a little this agreement here on the operation and there will be a fixed fight

[00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:39.800]
Level you in a share is gonna win. So therefore we are working together and when the situation arises

[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:43.640]
We need to take the right decision to strike

[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:48.460]
That's how I don't want to let me know what we're talking about anyway doing and

[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:51.460]
We need to have

[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:56.880]
Ladies and gentlemen here we have the basis of a relationship is trust and confidence

[00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:02.580]
If we don't have that trust and confidence in each other and we think that we are bluffing each other

[00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:05.340]
I don't think that's a good way of moving forward

[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:11.720]
This is pretty good for our guy. I'm sure I saw here driving a cab two weeks ago

[00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:24.320]
George Bush doesn't care about black people the United States

[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:29.140]
Has no quarrel with the Iraqi people

[00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:33.600]
Our quarrel is with iraq's dictator and with his aggression

[00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:37.760]
Iraq will not be permitted to annex the way

[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:40.440]
Just the way it's going to be

[00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:01.860]
You

[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:16.800]
Hey

[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:19.500]
We're in the same day, starting off the sheet,

[00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:22.600]
but time's made me with the sheet.

[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:24.720]
It's going to be,

[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:28.680]
start off the same,

[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.780]
start off the flower in my way.

[00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:35.200]
Start off the same.

[00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:37.600]
10, 48, 12 minutes before our love at a clock,

[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.320]
we got mad dog coming up from hooters

[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:40.940]
and the pines between two and four.

[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.840]
And then it's the big power hour, man.

[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:45.140]
The most hysterical hour in the history of radio,

[00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:47.460]
four to five power hour with Hank and the mad dog together.

[00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:50.280]
Humpers sold all another hour and a half, five to six thirty,

[00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:54.380]
because the Marlin game is a seven o' five pregame at six thirty seven o' five.

[00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:58.060]
If the Marlin's have to fill it up, they fill these two games in the games of the year,

[00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:58.460]
you would say.

[00:33:58.960 --> 00:33:59.540]
I guess.

[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:00.480]
And it can't be.

[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:02.680]
You're already yesterday, you weren't counting them out.

[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.120]
I'm not honest.

[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.840]
Well, I do want to take four out now, I think.

[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:08.320]
I think they picked up a half a game yesterday.

[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:09.240]
I don't, huh?

[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:09.960]
They're four, yeah.

[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:12.440]
Four out of the wild card with about nine or ten to go.

[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:13.780]
In other words, they're done.

[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:17.280]
But I still think they gave it a heck of a shot with lowest payroll and a bunch of kids

[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.180]
that nobody ever heard of.

[00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:19.120]
And I'm reading this.

[00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:20.520]
I don't want to read it.

[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:24.400]
Not just a Dave Hyde column, but this other piece of crap in the Sun Centle going on

[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:24.640]
about.

[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:26.520]
He made this mistake and he left the picture in.

[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:27.600]
He brought him back after the rain.

[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:30.060]
So, okay, it was this first year managing at any level.

[00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:31.580]
I think he did a heck of a job, man.

[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:32.040]
Brownie.

[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:36.720]
Hey, when you got a win and you got to supplement the owner's ass, okay?

[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:36.920]
Right.

[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.400]
And he didn't suck ass.

[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:39.060]
That was the problem.

[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:42.640]
He didn't kiss up to Jeffrey Luria and he opened up a mouth because Luria was a bitch

[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:46.320]
and at the umpire and, you know, and Luria buying beanstalk.

[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:50.380]
He couldn't, you know, for as I'm concerned, squat in the middle of cornfield and drop a big load.

[00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:51.280]
I don't care what he does.

[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.060]
You got nobody coming to the games.

[00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:55.120]
You got a guy who did a heck of a job for you.

[00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:58.780]
And it always they always leave the sour taste in the fans mouth.

[00:34:58.880 --> 00:34:59.920]
And there's only like five fans.

[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:03.120]
Another thing that really crossed my ass in this article here in the Sun Centle.

[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:07.080]
And I don't know who wrote this because I chopped off the front page and I'll look it up again.

[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:11.840]
Boys, it's so idiotic about the possibility of his successor.

[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:16.340]
And they've already uh, our compounding information about a trio of third-based coaches

[00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:18.520]
like their receive interviews, Freddie Gonzalez and Braves,

[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:21.020]
Joey Coro, the White Sucks and Manny, active of the mess.

[00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:23.000]
It's in here's the thing that really gets me.

[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:27.540]
All three have Latin roots that speak fluent Spanish would be considered a significant upgrade

[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:29.160]
from the current English-only staff.

[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.360]
Can you explain to me what the hell that means?

[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:31.820]
Huh?

[00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:34.100]
Well, maybe it's because it's not an upgrade because, huh?

[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.500]
None of the players speaking English.

[00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:37.160]
Get out of here.

[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.020]
On the marlins?

[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:40.120]
Don Trel, what language is he speaking?

[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:40.580]
Oh, okay.

[00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:41.480]
I can hear myself.

[00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:43.240]
Oh, Dan, I can keep going with the thing.

[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:43.700]
Dan Ogli?

[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.120]
I'd say 85%.

[00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:46.900]
No speaking English?

[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:47.560]
Oh, yeah.

[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.320]
They can't speak a very good English.

[00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:49.920]
Oh.

[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:50.880]
Well, you know something?

[00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:51.820]
Speak it English.

[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:55.800]
Okay, you want to play in Florida and the US speak English, or you go back and get on

[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:56.100]
the banana.

[00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:57.660]
You know that's not how it works.

[00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.000]
Even what's his name?

[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:00.620]
Even Puggeron Riggus speaking English.

[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:01.920]
He before he crosses himself.

[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:02.820]
He says holy crap.

[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:03.280]
Oh, yeah.

[00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:06.000]
By the way, the Tigers had tried to like hell the fold, didn't they?

[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.640]
Are they still hanging on?

[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:08.540]
I don't pay much attention.

[00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:10.820]
Yes, they are, but they've lost a lot.

[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:11.580]
Oh, boy.

[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:13.260]
Oh, there's that Richard Armitage from the monsters.

[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:14.220]
Look at him.

[00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:14.920]
Mm-hmm.

[00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:16.120]
Man, oh man.

[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:17.620]
Oh, forget about the monsters.

[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:18.400]
The monsters.

[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:18.960]
Nice teeth.

[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.420]
I mean, oh my God.

[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:21.120]
Of course he's denying.

[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:22.340]
Nice teeth.

[00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:24.060]
Oh, I don't want to see.

[00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:25.120]
No, no, no.

[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:26.920]
Yeah, you got some heavy-duty credibility.

[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:27.820]
Not thick.

[00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:30.100]
Anyway, compact with evil.

[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:32.400]
The McCain compromise on Bush's torture program.

[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.960]
I better start this now, because this is, here's the meat.

[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:35.480]
Okay.

[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:37.400]
You're ready to get the A1 sauce out.

[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:38.480]
Sprinkle it on your radio.

[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:39.620]
Just smear it on your plate.

[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:40.440]
Smear and smear.

[00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:42.760]
Chris Floyd on the smirking, smirking chimp rights.

[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:49.540]
After George Bush's rose garden, his deep fit in which he declared that he would simply stop interrogating suspected terrorists and listen to torture them,

[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:57.480]
John, I only flip flop on matters of the principal McCain, and the other so-called Senate rebels have capitulated the unpopular president's petulant demands.

[00:36:58.060 --> 00:36:58.600]
I love that.

[00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:01.520]
John, I only flip flop on matters of the principal McCain.

[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:02.320]
It's great.

[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:13.620]
In the universe of moral perversion in which we now live, White House National Security Advisors Steven Hadley called the Pro Torture Anti-Due Process Agreement between those deeply cynical power games to a good day for the American people.

[00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:15.700]
Here's how the games to achieve described it.

[00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:21.380]
I'm pleased to say this agreement preserves the most single, the most potent tool we haven't protecting America and boiling terrorist attacks.

[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:28.360]
He said, adding the agreement clears the way to do what the American people expect us to do, the captured terrorists to detain terrorists, the questioned terrorists, and then to try them.

[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:33.940]
In other words, not until this very day was the American government able to capture detain questions and try terrorists, I bet you didn't know that.

[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:38.760]
The people who were captured detain questions and tried and convicted for the 93 World Trade Center, Bobby, didn't know that either.

[00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:40.100]
Really, that's what Bush said.

[00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:44.980]
The agreement clears the way for the government to actually detain and interrogate terrorists is if they couldn't do that before.

[00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:53.200]
What he means, of course, is that the ability of torture alleged terrorists, that's arbitrarily anywhere in the world, simply on the say so of the leader or his designated minions, will be preserved.

[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:58.380]
Bush obviously has a deep psychological need to feel that someone is being tormented in his orders at all times.

[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:09.780]
But the amended psychology of this sad little shrill up nothing of a man as of slight import, what matters are the actions and policies that are being carried out by the Junta operating in his name and the countenancing of this game scrummed by the U.S. Congress.

[00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:11.520]
Now you'd say, Hunta, I'd say Junta.

[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:20.560]
What can that be seen today, the countenancing of torture and kangaroo courts by some sad sex of Shainola, lauded by the media as men of principle, sad sex of Shainola.

[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:23.080]
Laudate, this is what we've come to. This is where we are today.

[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:27.780]
Sick bastards and cynical bastards openly and eagerly, gutting their very core of American law.

[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:35.560]
Let's have Bill Frist, surely one of the most pathetic creatures ever inflicted on the West Senate and the long-suffering people of Tennessee, explain exactly what this great agreement means.

[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:43.820]
He said the agreement had two key points. Classified information will not be shared with the terrorist tribe before the tribunals, and the very important program of interrogation continues.

[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:53.860]
There you have it. People snatched off the street or sold to spies by snitches and scantiers can be tried in military tribunals without seeing the evidence against them, and Bush's program of interrogation continues.

[00:38:54.340 --> 00:39:08.780]
Let's be very clear on the latter point what Bush has been talking about in protesting against wherever it's to ensure that CIA interrogators cannot torture suspects, because of course they could continue to use ordinary methods of interrogation, which experts uniformly agree produce better intelligence anyhow, just as they've always been able to.

[00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:19.240]
When Bush and Tennessee cat-tourch were talking about the program of interrogation continuing, they mean allowing the CIA to torture cat-tourch various methods without being charged with war crimes and felony violations of American law.

[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:29.880]
That's exactly what they're talking about, and nothing else. But you won't see it put that way in the pages of our most August journalist institutions, nor the broadcast of our World War Novel TV shows, and let us make another point.

[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:35.140]
In a most impolitic way for the truth is often an impolitical commodity. John McCain is a GD liar.

[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:45.460]
Yes, he himself suffered torture. Yes, he came through it. Yes, we all admire his fortitude during the Ordeal and his youth, but his record in later life and politics is out of a moral coward with good PR skills.

[00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:50.340]
Not that it takes much skill to wild the paltrooms who squat on the commanding heights of the corporate media world today.

[00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:57.240]
And today he has opened his mouth and a minute, a damnable eye to with the integrity and letter and spirit of the Geneva Conventions have been preserved.

[00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:05.520]
This is an untrue statement. An allegace to say the moon is located in his rectum, rectum, or that he can bite through a pig iron with his bare teeth.

[00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:12.780]
Every step the Bush gang has taken in this pro-tourcher Don't Prosecutors campaign is designed a week in the integrity and letter and spirit of the Geneva Conventions.

[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:19.660]
The conventions which have been adopted in the law by Congress and Bill Sponsored and Champion by Republicans are crystal clear on torture.

[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:24.700]
There is no need to preserve their integrity with new legislation. There's nothing wrong with the conventions that need to be fixed.

[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:29.740]
Unless, of course, you wish to use interrogation techniques that any sentient human being would recognize his torture.

[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:34.320]
In that case, of course, you have to fix the conventions by gutting their integrity, letter, and spirit.

[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:38.620]
John McCain might be a moral coward in his old age, but he's not stupid. He knows all this.

[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:43.320]
He knows the Bush administration has been trying to wriggle out of the conventions since the earliest days of the so-called war on terror.

[00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:49.820]
He knows that gutting conventions is at the heart of Bush's interrogation program, which McCain and his rebels have just saved with their grand compromise.

[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:54.940]
Therefore, we'll say it again clearly so that even the neighbors on the Washington Post editorial page can hear it.

[00:40:55.180 --> 00:41:02.220]
John McCain is a GD liar and is agreement today, or yesterday, sure some of the most evil principles ever supported openly by the U.S. government's enslavery.

[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:09.400]
And let's put this other point more plainly one more time. The American government has always been able to capture, to obtain question and try terrorists always.

[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:16.600]
The American government has for 20 years had the power to use drop on anyone in the world or in the country whom they suspected, even slightly of terrorism or terrorist connections.

[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:22.560]
And they could do it and can do that instantly without waiting for a court order or jumping through any bureaucratic hoops under the long existing law.

[00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:27.680]
Everything that Bush says his clearly illegal surveillance programs do can already be done within the law.

[00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:37.860]
Therefore, it's clear that the whole reason behind the illegal programs is to establish the principle that the president is beyond the law, and also almost certainly to perform illegal surveillance that has nothing to do with terrorism.

[00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:43.860]
What we've seen is no grand compromise, no great debate, no act of principle, and certainly no preservation of the genuine and genuine conventions.

[00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:50.740]
What we've seen instead is a small group of rich cynical power hungry old bastards, bells-fort lies, and the service of torture and tyranny.

[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:55.340]
And if you're not angry about that, if you're not sure about that, then by God you're one of the piss poor American citizens.

[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:59.640]
You shame every man and woman who fought and died and marched and worked and dreamed for our freedoms.

[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:06.100]
What a great column, eh? A lot of profanity in there had to clear up a little because we don't want to get the enjoy stomachs.

[00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:06.860]
That's not a big deal.

[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:08.220]
It's a brilliant surveillance.

[00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:11.800]
The vicious rule of torture and forced-radiophied guilty.

[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:16.980]
This is the neo-roture show.

[00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:19.800]
This is your brain.

[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:22.760]
Any questions?

[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:24.600]
I'm fine.

[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:26.660]
I'm fine. Drive here.

[00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:36.880]
Well, did you hear about the Muslims and what they've done?

[00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:43.380]
They said fire, just some churches. They shot and killed and none.

[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:47.180]
They say they're not really violent.

[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:50.120]
They say they're not really means.

[00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:56.320]
All the Muslims I've met at, then it's history.

[00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:58.040]
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, fair.

[00:42:58.360 --> 00:42:59.780]
Then it gets history.

[00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:03.020]
What did he say?

[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:06.480]
To make those Muslims away?

[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:08.060]
Or, eh?

[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:16.020]
And at that way, maybe it's because he's from Germany.

[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:20.160]
Guys are choosing little Nazis.

[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:22.660]
Then it gets history.

[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.800]
Now they're protesting in cash, man.

[00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:29.360]
They're all going insane.

[00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:32.900]
It's a profit no harm.

[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:36.220]
They say the poultry fans.

[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:40.040]
All over the Middle East.

[00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:42.440]
They're burning up with you.

[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:48.880]
All the Muslims I've met at, then it gets history.

[00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:50.500]
I'm fine, I'm fine.

[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.880]
All the Muslims I've met at, you, fair.

[00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:55.440]
Then it gets history.

[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:57.220]
I'm a step down, pop, okay?

[00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:58.680]
Let somebody else have those nice words,

[00:43:58.960 --> 00:43:59.800]
look, please, and give them shots.

[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.160]
You think they can pacify these crazy masses out there.

[00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:03.540]
All these geckies, baby.

[00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:05.040]
All the wild geckies.

[00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:08.000]
That thing about which religion, you know, the Jews,

[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:10.280]
that's, that's, that's interesting.

[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:12.940]
But the atheist being right there by the Scientologists,

[00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:13.840]
as far as I'm popular.

[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:14.160]

[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:15.820]
Now that's shocking.

[00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:19.140]
But of course they show how far America is below the rest of the world

[00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:21.500]
in terms of intellect, especially in Western Europe.

[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:23.660]
The difference between, and the Canada.

[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:25.280]
The difference between a religious fanaticism

[00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:27.960]
in the countries of Western Europe and in Canada.

[00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:30.300]
And the US is like the difference between day and night,

[00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:33.400]
between dark ages and a little bit of enlightenment, eh?

[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.280]
I mean, they have all those huge churches

[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:36.620]
that were built hundreds of years ago

[00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:37.780]
in every major city in Europe.

[00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:38.420]
And you know what they are?

[00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:40.100]
Basically tourist attractions now.

[00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:42.940]
But nevertheless, I don't want to get started on that

[00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:45.080]
because it's a very unpopular thing to be in.

[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:46.940]
Eight years of God, verse eight.

[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:47.840]
Oh, geez.

[00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:48.320]
Ooh.

[00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:51.200]
And anyway, here's the first poll.

[00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:51.620]
It's done.

[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:52.960]
Thanks Eric, by the way.

[00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:54.440]
And I hope you had a good time at the Parliament House.

[00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:57.720]
955 votes on poll one, which means we only need 45

[00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:59.160]
and no one to get to our thousand, right?

[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:00.620]
Well, what a sneaky way that is.

[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:02.500]
Where do you get most of your news, most?

[00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:03.920]
And thanks again, Deb, for this poll.

[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:05.980]
And I want to like, short, you know, sell it short.

[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:08.240]
We've done it before, and number two, it's, you know,

[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:11.160]
it's okay if it's not strong enough for a weekend poll, right?

[00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:11.640]
Right.

[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:13.240]
That means it's going to be up there all weekend.

[00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:14.620]
I mean, what would you rather do?

[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:16.880]
Be voting on our poll over the weekend or watching football games?

[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:17.400]
I'm sorry.

[00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:20.840]
Well, I'd rather be watching football games too.

[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:21.500]
Okay, I'm sorry.

[00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:22.520]
I hate to say that to you.

[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:23.060]
Who the hell are they?

[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:24.160]
A Patriot's playing this weekend.

[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:25.560]
Oh, better than that's right.

[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:27.120]
Denver, you better get with it, Josh.

[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:30.260]
A little bit slow since you had the bug on Tuesday.

[00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:31.400]
You still got the bug?

[00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:32.740]
There are a lot of bugs in that movie.

[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:33.320]
I'll tell you that.

[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:35.020]
I thought that was kind of neat, though.

[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:37.220]
I mean, it was gross in Silent Hill.

[00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:40.560]
It looked like cockroaches, but then it turned out they were like people.

[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:43.680]
They were like little people in those, oh, maybe they were the beetles.

[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:47.740]
Maybe that's why they kept stepping on them.

[00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:48.440]
They thought it was Ringo.

[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:50.160]
Where do you get most of your news?

[00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:51.380]
Internet 434.

[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:51.860]
Excellent.

[00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:54.100]
Maybe they see there's hope for our audience anyway.

[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:56.360]
I keep trying to tell you if you want to know what's really going on in the world.

[00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:59.180]
Don't depend on this crap with your newspaper and your TV.

[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:00.340]
Forget about it.

[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:01.300]
Get on the Internet.

[00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:02.080]
Read some crap.

[00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:03.480]
Even if it's only our website.

[00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:06.320]
That's why I draw from like 15, 20 different websites, at least,

[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:09.220]
because then we give you some stuff.

[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:13.020]
As opposed to having you sit there trying to scour through a hundred different websites every day.

[00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:15.560]
Internet 434, Neil show 134.

[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:16.880]
We're awfully newsy these days.

[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:19.300]
This person now that we shut that phone down permanent.

[00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:21.740]
Although you can call in Josh will take your call.

[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:23.260]
Are you taking any calls?

[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:24.040]
Oh, boy.

[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:25.880]
Am I taking them all that?

[00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:27.280]
You've been taking lots of calls.

[00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:27.960]
I'm screaming.

[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:29.340]
I might as well be screaming.

[00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:31.280]
I'm actually, you might as well, I am.

[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:31.820]
That's what I'm doing.

[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:33.160]
And he's screaming while he's screaming.

[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:34.040]
Screaming and screaming.

[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:35.620]
Oh, he's screaming.

[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:37.240]
Somebody to say was a screamer.

[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:38.700]
Newspaper 114.

[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:40.840]
No, I'm seriously, I like for today's poll.

[00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:43.960]
It's not like we've cut off the audience from communicating.

[00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:47.200]
If the phones ring, Josh will find out what you got, which is usually nothing.

[00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:50.500]
And then you can fax this in if you want to put somebody on the new poll we got up there.

[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:53.040]
Newspaper 114, local TV 57.

[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:55.280]
We didn't bother asking which one because why bother?

[00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:56.380]
CNN 50.

[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:57.240]
Oh, how sad.

[00:46:57.620 --> 00:46:58.400]
You know, that will flip screen.

[00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:00.140]
I told you before the show and I'll see it on the year.

[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:02.680]
When I see him on CNN during the day time.

[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:06.000]
During the afternoon when I make one of those channel surfing mistakes and I see him on there.

[00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:07.480]
And that's the situation room.

[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:10.600]
I actually get so angry I start screaming at the TV set.

[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:14.080]
Which, you know, it's a lot easier just to change the channel that you know me as screamer.

[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:14.800]
CNN 50.

[00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:15.960]
MSNBC 39.

[00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:16.740]
Please.

[00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:18.200]
Well, they don't have much.

[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:19.760]
They got Chris, you know, Jonathan Keith.

[00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:22.240]
They got Chris Mathews talking about politics.

[00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:25.680]
So, you know, if you're going to talk about something, at least be able to say the word, right?

[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:26.740]
Wouldn't it be a good idea?

[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:27.680]
How would it take art?

[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:29.040]
What a jerk he is.

[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:30.320]
MSNBC 39.

[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:31.500]
Daily Show 37.

[00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:32.760]
NBC 28.

[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:34.460]
Brian Williams with that strange head, but he's good.

[00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:36.360]
I mean, he's an excellent newscaster.

[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:37.520]
You know, you can handle him.

[00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:41.160]
He's, you know, an addition to which they're not, they don't have their head up pushes ass on that newsgiving.

[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:41.860]
You notice that lately?

[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:43.200]
No, just other hair.

[00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:46.440]
No, they're starting to give a few shots here lately, more than usual.

[00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:49.420]
Maybe the Keith Overman impact is rubbing off from MSNBC.

[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:50.640]
And let me see 28.

[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:52.520]
I don't care about the news 23.

[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:53.660]
ABC 15.

[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:55.860]
Charlie Gibson, who's head keeps shaking around.

[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:56.660]
But he's, he's okay.

[00:47:57.060 --> 00:47:58.020]
I hit this pool 11.

[00:47:58.220 --> 00:47:59.600]
CBS only 8.

[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:18.240]
I'm going to have pictures.

[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:19.280]
Nightmares now.

[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:22.720]
And bam, my God.

[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:24.160]
Talk about the Alta Babichki.

[00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:24.400]
Wow.

[00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:25.480]
How do you like that picture?

[00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:27.900]
You know, the thing about her is she was always ugly.

[00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:29.080]
It's just the murder of Degrees.

[00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:29.580]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:29.580]

[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:29.580]

[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:29.580]

[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:29.580]

[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:29.580]

[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:29.580]

[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:29.580]

[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:29.580]

[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:29.580]

[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:29.580]

[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:29.580]

[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:29.580]

[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:29.580]

[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:29.580]

[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:29.580]

[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:29.580]

[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:29.580]

[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:29.580]

[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:29.580]

[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:29.580]

[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:29.840]
Oh, right.

[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:32.420]
Oh, but I don't come close to describing it one picture.

[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:36.980]
Looks like a washerwoman, like a Portuguese washerwoman, with apologies to our Portuguese friends.

[00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:38.160]
Okay, here's the new pool.

[00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:40.980]
Well, I got, you know, something I have a pile.

[00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:45.940]
Even those of you who have the worst roads in history, I just never had piles like this.

[00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:46.860]
Oh, look at that.

[00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:47.660]
The fight for Iraq.

[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:49.280]
It was a single shot.

[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:49.960]
Uh-oh.

[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:50.560]
More shots.

[00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:51.380]
More bloodshed.

[00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:53.740]
Who's your favorite commas or commentator?

[00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:55.320]
We got 40 votes already.

[00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:56.340]
So we got 9.95.

[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:57.980]
We need five more votes to get to our thousand.

[00:48:57.980 --> 00:48:58.680]
Now we can go home.

[00:48:59.120 --> 00:48:59.980]
Uh, don't have 111.

[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:01.500]
Well, you know something?

[00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:02.220]
Up yours.

[00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:03.420]
That's what I would say to you.

[00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:04.060]
Up yours.

[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:04.740]
Don't have one.

[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:05.340]
Isn't that brilliant?

[00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:05.980]
Uh-huh.

[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:10.380]
I mean, there are a lot of other ones we could put on here, but they would know who the hell they were.

[00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:11.960]
Keith Oberman 9.

[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:13.880]
More in doubt 7.

[00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:15.040]
Doug Thompson 4.

[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:15.920]
That's Captain Little Blue.

[00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:16.640]
I voted for him.

[00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:20.640]
I mean, I like a lot of these others so much, but he's just, he doesn't pull any punches.

[00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:23.940]
Just like the article I just got through reading there, which wasn't his, but like that.

[00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:25.440]
I voted for Degrees.

[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:25.940]
Yeah.

[00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:27.100]
He just pulls.

[00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:29.520]
No, he takes the gloves off and kicks him to the action.

[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:30.200]

[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:31.040]
Keith Oberman 14.

[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:31.460]
Good.

[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:32.500]
Don't have one 14.

[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:33.280]
Marine doubt 10.

[00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:34.020]
Doug Thompson 4.

[00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:35.500]
Molly Ivinz 2.

[00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:36.620]
I got one of her stories today.

[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:37.700]
Blue Dobbs 2.

[00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:40.900]
I bet you're not illegal aliens those two guys who voted.

[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:42.000]
Rush Limbaugh 2.

[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:45.180]
And I actually, he's a talk host as his billor Riley, but you know, I want to give the right

[00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:45.940]
wingers their chance.

[00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:48.080]
Rush has got a pair and Bill has got a pair.

[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:48.600]
Or Riley.

[00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:48.980]
Billo.

[00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:49.980]
As Keith calls him.

[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:50.280]
Billo.

[00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:51.780]
I hate this poll too.

[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:52.520]
Well, you know what?

[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:53.500]
I hate you like poison.

[00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:54.920]
I wish you would die a wicked death.

[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:56.780]
Katrina Van Den Hovel won from the nation.

[00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:58.520]
Thomas Friedman's got one.

[00:49:58.700 --> 00:49:59.440]
Oh boy.

[00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:00.140]
Wow.

[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:04.900]
Must be from some, maybe maybe that was from Wolf voted for Thomas Friedman.

[00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:06.100]
He likes those Zionists, you know.

[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:07.900]
David Corn won from the nation.

[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:08.580]
Tom Hartman won.

[00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:09.540]
Michael Medved.

[00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:10.360]
David Broder.

[00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:11.000]
David Brooks.

[00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:11.740]
Nothing else.

[00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:13.720]
John Nichols and Frank Rich don't have any.

[00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:17.140]
Now if anybody votes for Michael Medved, we will come to your house and blow your brains out.

[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:19.720]
Although it will be hard to find, but we'll get a search party.

[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:22.000]
One reason I put Michael Medved on earth.

[00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:22.740]
I don't know.

[00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:27.220]
Whatever I do, Billo, forgive me.

[00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:29.140]
I was now I speak in tongues.

[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:32.140]
That makes me a believer.

[00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:33.120]
John again.

[00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:35.180]
End of happens for.

[00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:35.920]
Up and down.

[00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:38.140]
They are now the time.

[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:41.460]
Now I speak in tongues.

[00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:41.880]
Now I speak in tongues.

[00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:43.560]
Now I speak in tongues.

[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:45.620]
Now I speak in tongues.

[00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:45.840]
Now I speak in tongues.

[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:46.060]
Now I speak in tongues.

[00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:47.100]
Now I speak in tongues.

[00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:49.300]
Now I speak in tongues.

[00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:49.700]
Now I speak in tongues.

[00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:49.700]

[00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:49.700]

[00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:49.700]

[00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:49.700]

[00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:49.700]

[00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:49.700]

[00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:49.700]

[00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:49.700]

[00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:00.860]
Now I speak in tongues.

[00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:01.040]
Now I speak in tongues.

[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:01.040]

[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:01.040]

[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:01.040]

[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:01.040]

[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:01.720]
Now I speak in tongues.

[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:02.340]
Now I speak in tongues.

[00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:02.660]
Now I speak in tongues.

[00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:03.300]
Now I speak in tongues.

[00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:04.300]
Now I speak in tongues.

[00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:04.300]

[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:05.360]
Now I speak in tongues.

[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:05.840]
Now I speak in tongues.

[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:06.200]
Now I speak in tongues.

[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:06.520]
Now I speak in tongues.

[00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:06.840]
Now I speak in tongues.

[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:08.360]
Now I speak in tongues.

[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:09.540]
Now I speak in tongues.

[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:10.800]
Now I speak in tongues.

[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.140]
Now I speak in tongues.

[00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:13.340]

[01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:34.740]
Lesbian Agen is in Asia.

[01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:34.740]

[01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:35.140]
Lesbian Agen is in Asia.

[01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:35.300]
Lesbian Agen is in Asia.

[01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:35.820]
Lesbian Agen is in Africa.

[01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:35.820]

[01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:47.140]
Sebastian Lос جялиσαłμοł LTK

[01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:49.380]
How what a disgrace that is

[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:51.100]
They have this race

[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:58.220]
Television stations in Montana you live there. Yeah, you know what kind of a place that is it's a very

[01:11:58.220 --> 01:12:02.640]
Place television stations in Montana been warned that an ad produced by the Democratic

[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:07.180]
Senatorial campaign committee containing statements made by Republican Senator Conrad Burns

[01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:11.060]
Maybe inappropriate for television. How do you like that? Oh?

[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:15.400]
No, what did Conrad say the warning came from the Montana Broadcasts Association?

[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:22.300]
One station KTVQ pulled the ad after one viewing the station manager told congressional quarterly

[01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:27.320]
He was absolutely appalled that somebody that anybody had found the ad to be appropriate for television

[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:30.400]
The ad included statements made by Burns including the phrase

[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:36.400]
Pissed poor and the senators claim that a firefighter hadn't done a g-damn thing I can't say it during an hour and a

[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:39.360]
Missed you well during an hour and a Miss July encounter to monitor in the airport

[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:43.120]
I can't say but he did and that's why there's the big flat the big countertops

[01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:47.340]
Burns isn't a closely contested race for reelection against Democratic opponent John Tester

[01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:53.480]
The commercial and questions starts praising firefighters as heroes quickly changes the quotes from an alleged confrontation

[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:59.200]
Burns had with several firefighters in July while waiting for a flight at the building's airport Conrad Burns

[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:05.500]
up as they've done quite quote a piss poor job and while pointing at one he hasn't done a g-d thing so the ends enough

[01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:06.640]
Hey like that

[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:10.560]
Nice. Yeah real classy guy with his cowboy hat

[01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:17.440]
Real Yehu man Yehu but then against the kind of a Yehu country trans fat facts here we go

[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:21.060]
Reading which might explain why there is so slow

[01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:24.600]
Dr. Sanjay Gupta see it and they show those greasy fries

[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:28.560]
Maybe that's the first thing they show when they were talking about transplants fries french fries

[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:32.640]
They'll kill you see I don't mind like dying from ice cream because ice cream is delicious

[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:35.200]
Yeah, something that's really good or like a

[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:37.500]
When these triple-making cheeseburger

[01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:41.300]
Mmm, that sounds great. Yeah, but to die for french fries

[01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:45.820]
They were sure unless you load them now with salt and then add brown sauce or mayonnaise or ketchup or something

[01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:50.940]
They don't have any taste. You don't have to load them down with salt McDonald's fries lightly salted

[01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:52.780]
You could eat my weight in them

[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:59.460]
You're gonna die. Oh, I know it soon. Torture in Iraq worst in under shot. I'm how do you like that speaking about you're gonna die

[01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:04.660]
I'm dying over here things are going so swimmingly well and leave it to the Democrats to point things here

[01:14:04.660 --> 01:14:10.160]
Oh, they can't be a screaming about these things like have one art see I'm thinking that article I read before the

[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:12.880]
One about screaming and yelling and carrying on and about

[01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:19.080]
Yeah, that's the kind of stuff that democratic party ought to be to instead of sucking up like they were doing yesterday

[01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:22.440]
They see Pelosi and that disappointing Charlie Wrangle

[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:25.780]
I thought he really had a pair of but they must have sliced them off

[01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:31.940]
Nobody needs to come to my country and tell me and solve our president your mama so socks in hell Charlie

[01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:35.660]
You gotta be ashamed yourself that people at chavis got a bigger pair than you got

[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:41.100]
Torture in Iraq is worse now than it was under the regime of son of Hussein and is totally out of hand

[01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:44.700]
According to a UN investigator. Well, what the hell would they know, you know, right?

[01:14:44.860 --> 01:14:50.060]
The situation is so bad so many people say it's worse than it was in times of son of Hussein said man for no whack

[01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:52.300]
I wonder if he's can demand for man a lot of them

[01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:57.200]
That's the way you especially on that do odd video you went special investigator on torture at a press conference in Geneva

[01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:00.340]
I was actually in even New York or Geneva Switzerland fights

[01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:05.220]
There's the man for man right there. Oh, if you let it go I nailed it

[01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:12.400]
That's enough he said can't by the way thanks for the Belmont thing. That's great

[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:17.540]
I got it. I caught it cranked. I don't need to hear no more man for man. Okay. Yeah, that is a good song

[01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:20.800]
I got Belmont song I forgot all about come on little angels great. It wasn't big hit

[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:26.120]
But it's a fabulous song Belmont's were very good. He went out to you. I mean deans you know, they're ain't no other deon

[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:30.440]
But they were good. He said government forces private militia and terrorist groups were all involved

[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:33.560]
You have terrorist groups you have the military have the police you have these militias

[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:40.260]
There are so many people who actually are abducted seriously tortured and finally killed said mr. Nocturus Austrian law professor

[01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:41.900]
Oh Austrian, huh?

[01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:49.440]
It's not just tortured by just how's the what's his name doing by the way John the Austrian who your buddy there in power

[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:55.240]
Our Austrian friend. Oh John Jarrett John Jarrett Lulaiva. Yeah, I believe her. Yeah, she's good

[01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:58.340]
Tom don't be seen me no more candy bars

[01:15:58.340 --> 01:16:04.140]
Anyway, it's not just torture by the government no waxed. There are much more brutal methods of torture you'll find by private militias

[01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:09.520]
He also said that bodies are being discovered with very heavy and very serious torture marks. Oh no

[01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:12.820]
That's right. I forgot. Oh great

[01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:15.700]
He said a mission to a rack to investigate torture was too dangerous

[01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:19.640]
But you've got information from interviews with people in Amman Jordan and other sources

[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:20.340]
Mr

[01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:25.340]
No, what his engine even a brief you went human rights counsel on the situation of the US detention facility at Gitmo

[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:31.020]
He's one of five human rights investigators who in February called for the closure of Gitmo on the grounds that say torture camp

[01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:34.340]
It calls across rejected by the US because they believe in

[01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:35.800]
Pagemini mr

[01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:40.820]
No wax comments came a day after the human rights office at the UN assistance mission and a rack race concerns about the violence

[01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:45.140]
Gryping the country it said that 6600 people had died in July and August which I told you yesterday

[01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:48.560]
6600 in July and August civilians not soldiers not

[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:53.860]
Insurgents not evil. There was civilians people just minded a business trying to go to work to school

[01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:59.980]
Traded while and picked their nose and whatever they shouldn't have supported Al Qaeda there you go and the interesting thing

[01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:01.540]
I'm here and now is that if the US ever leaves

[01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:06.040]
This is the new threat if the US ever pulls the military out then Al Qaeda is in a position to take over

[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:08.520]
Of course there was no Al Qaeda in Iraq before the Iraq attack

[01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:11.500]
But don't confuse the American public with effects or the American media

[01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:15.920]
It would be very bad for business to be putting in that kind of context. Why do you hate America?

[01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:22.300]
Exactly that's the answer to everything that is their answer. Oh look at that in an hour

[01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:26.440]
More or not going to get no 300. I got really carried away there. It's not like the old days when we had an audience

[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:30.380]
But we do have two two something two nineteen on the new pool

[01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:33.080]
Yeah, we had a much bigger audience back then

[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:36.480]
But that's before they destroyed the radio station and before all this crap happened

[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:40.140]
Well you'll see in you if you don't start taking calls again hold your breath

[01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:44.940]
Okay, inhale right now and we'll have somebody banging on the back of the head real hard once time to exhale

[01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:47.980]
Yeah, that's it two nineteen on there

[01:17:47.980 --> 01:17:51.940]
You know something if we get a one-share or a ten-share does it really make all that much difference? No

[01:17:51.940 --> 01:17:58.320]
That bonus money isn't gonna change my life yours maybe yeah, I doubt it a lot. Is it really? Oh, yeah

[01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:03.440]
Okay, so we better get a ten-share you better you better take a lot of calls when you run to make up for the ones that I'm not taking

[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:04.020]
The good morning

[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:08.040]
Well several times who is your favorite communist or commentator?

Captain Harris so just took a couple of miles and nail polish

[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:44.540]
12.01 maybe she's trying to polish upper act because her campaign is really really bland and she's it

[01:21:44.540 --> 01:21:48.440]
This is the best thing that anybody could have done although I'm looking at a lot of these matchups for the assistant

[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:53.480]
And some of these stories I'm sending and start to get real hairy man really tight real tight

[01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:57.960]
You know let's get to fix him. They know how to do it. Maybe they'll get fix it to do it

250 votes. Yeah good old fix it. He knows how to do a Doug Thompson writes a bandit hope all the who vote here

[01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:07.460]
Speaking of what I just said. Sounds pretty pessimistic on it. Yeah

[01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:10.020]
Wow, you know him. He's not gonna blue sky

[01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:17.800]
Well his below stage is a massive victory rally in Beirut did you see that and they said they're a lot stronger than they were before which we did that after that disaster in lesbian on

[01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:20.860]
I know a lot of it so many people rallied around them because of it. That is correct

[01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:27.220]
That is right. They got a lot more money rally because he could join the better know that shouldn't arm is blown off and stuff

[01:22:27.220 --> 01:22:29.900]
Other than that and went home to Barney Rubble and not much else

[01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:33.340]
How many more must I because of the seat arrogance of the American government?

[01:22:33.340 --> 01:22:36.520]
And it's just spotically their George W. Bush dog Thompson wants to know

[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:39.980]
I think a lot of the rest of us would like to know as well. How many thousand more must I?

[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:46.560]
Be the October surprise how much deeper must America sink in at least set pool of corruption? How much is enough?

[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:53.240]
According to the you went a record 6600 Racky civilians died in July and August is a direct result of the illegal American invasion of a

[01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:57.180]
Sovereignation on trumped up charges that have won by one fall into the onslaught of fact

[01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:02.700]
Even worse the when reports as torture of Iraqi civilians have surpassed the levels during the reign of Sada Hussain

[01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:05.160]
This is what we call liberation question mark

[01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:11.340]
Bush is cool calculated manipulation of Congress and meeting the American public allowed him to launch an invasion based on lies and

[01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:15.340]
Action at the previous Pope called a war crime remember the fat Pope to Slav on the slam right

[01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:18.360]
The Republicans will control Congress when along with his madness

[01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:23.980]
But so too did most of the Democrats every in the House and Senate and too many of them are still reluctant to oppose the war and call it forward

[01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:29.920]
Draw even today these mindless brain dead lemming still follow this madman and his insane policies into the abyss

[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:34.480]
Obviously unconcerned about the damage to individual liberty civil rights and little document called the

[01:23:35.020 --> 01:23:41.900]
Constitution of the USA such pathetic intellectually challenged morons like Bush put political partisanship above their country and

[01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:45.780]
Don't give a rat's ass about the law morality ethics. They like the present

[01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:50.040]
They follow our little more than the scum of the earth. Oh, I love this guy. I'm changing my vote

[01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:51.640]
He's already voted I'm gonna vote again

[01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:56.740]
Yet these credence may actually keep controller government after the midterm elections because the Democrats like both on both

[01:23:56.740 --> 01:24:01.920]
Usable brain matter and political savvy and if you have to offer any real alternatives to voters to win in November

[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:05.380]
The Democrats need to offer something with an ounce of logic and a modicum of common sense

[01:24:05.380 --> 01:24:09.360]
They can't because like Republicans original thought is beyond their capacity

[01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:17.420]
Sadly politicians of either party like the ability to come up with anything that really matters to the American people both Democrats and Republicans are hopeless losers

[01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:20.100]
Who couldn't get laid in a whorehouse on freebie night?

[01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:25.400]
Bush and Republicans have their lemmings and so do the Democrats political persons are foolish little followers who

[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:30.000]
Subscribe to the Nene beliefs that a political party is capable of caring about the world of people or the

[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.000]
Well-for-of-nation

[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:36.600]
They like both the capacity or the will and anyone who thinks that the system is the best we can do lost their minds years ago

[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:41.440]
In the end voters this fall are left with no real choice no real hope and no real way out of the morass

[01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:45.140]
Morass that sounds like a good campaign slogan morass

[01:24:45.140 --> 01:24:48.120]
I'll work on it the corruption the Republican party must be stopped

[01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:53.260]
But the only other choice in the battle is another collection of fing idiots and capable of leaning in a cup scot back out of a city

[01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:58.340]
Park park maybe the best answer is to just bring the soldiers home from Iraq and then send every elected official

[01:24:58.340 --> 01:25:03.560]
Republican and Democrat along with every political want to be too Iraq and leave their faith to the fanatics

[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:08.200]
Suicide bombers and Islamic extremists then maybe we can start over and build a real government

[01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:14.360]
He's like I said why is he calls for the really friends? I know I had a seat around the bush like that

[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:17.200]
Yeah, he's fabulous and other days undercover somewhere that he's in hiding

[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:22.820]
He would I wouldn't be surprised if he's in the same cab cable though some I think is Carl's bad cabernors on them

[01:25:22.820 --> 01:25:28.960]
Yeah, bad he'd be bad. He's only got eight votes Bill O'Reilly's got 16. He's got eight does that then that's in our audience

[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:31.580]
Does that tell you what does it going on? I think O'Reilly's

[01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:34.180]
I think I think no I think it's a free job

[01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:38.560]
Authority is issued a debt certificate for the son of Anna Cole Smith. I know you're on it

[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:44.620]
Oh, now here's a picture of her she looks really good. She she has been she has looked good. No, no, this this is recent

[01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:47.720]
Okay in February. I'm just talking about a headshot

[01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:52.420]
I'm talking about what weight is body and when you don't dump when you balloon up to 600 pounds your body

[01:25:52.420 --> 01:25:53.980]
He's never probably gonna look all that great again

[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:59.380]
But the headshot looks pretty good. I mean your face authorities issued a debt certificate for the son of Anna Nicole

[01:25:59.380 --> 01:26:02.200]
But left to cause it up undetermined pending tax taxicock

[01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:03.840]
Taxicock

[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:09.160]
Taxicology test alert for the form reality TV stars family say yesterday the document will let the former playboy playmate

[01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:14.980]
Very-her son Daniel who died September and didn't Elton John to a song about him. Yes, who died September 10th of his mother's hospital

[01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:21.240]
But side of the Bahamas turning Michael Scott said filed on Wednesday that that certificate listed causes pending chemical analysis

[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:23.220]
Since chief magistrate Roger Gomez

[01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:28.200]
I think it one thing you know when people in the Bahamas died they just have a hell of a time fingering it out, you know

[01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:31.200]
But it is Elton. Hey Elton you fairy

[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:34.300]
Knock him all you want man, but the old queen is still around

[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:38.560]
They shot him with five bullets and five needles and he still arrives still alive

[01:26:39.580 --> 01:26:43.580]
It's not unusual in circumstances where the cause of death cannot be determined wish your debt certificate

[01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:47.020]
Gomez said this is not a matter of special treatment being given in this particular case

[01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:50.000]
Scott also said Thursday that Smith or the Atlanta filed documents

[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.540]
Registry in the birth of her two-week-old daughter but declined to reveal her name

[01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:59.160]
He ended and Cole's been granted permanent residency in the Bahamas where she came to avoid media scrutiny during her pregnancy

[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:02.380]
She is gradually recovering from her the death rate 20-year-old son

[01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:06.260]
As if we really promise you really care about her

[01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:07.740]
Not now

[01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:09.600]
Give me that money

[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:14.920]
Well, I thought that Keith Oldman and his producers and the people at MSNBC were sent us all a big fat check for

[01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:19.600]
Pony the hell out of countdown eight to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday on MSNBC the best

[01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:26.360]
268 votes well, we got close to 300 in that first hour and of course that that was back in the day when we had to be the curtain on

[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:33.460]
Ersi right that would draw that would draw plenty of extra eyes to this website really ashamed Eric promised me

[01:27:33.460 --> 01:27:36.700]
He was gonna spend like 10 grand for a full-page yet and USA today to promote our website

[01:27:36.700 --> 01:27:41.140]
He didn't do it just like just like Josh has been a buy that big screen TV right any minute time

[01:27:41.620 --> 01:27:44.260]
Israel delays lesbian on pull out how do you like that?

[01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:49.400]
Israel delayed pulling out its remaining troops from lesbian on same questions still had to be earned out with the beef

[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:55.380]
WN peacekeeping force and the lesbianie's army we very much hope that the withdrawal be completed by a Friday meaning today

[01:27:55.380 --> 01:27:58.440]
But after contacts we've had with the UN in the lesbianie's army

[01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:03.500]
There are still unresolved questions army chief Dan Halleux told reporters. Well happy New Year Danny boy

[01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:06.560]
I hope they'll resolve them to come in two to three days after the holidays

[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:10.480]
They refer to the two-day Jewish New Year holiday which begins at sundown tonight a

[01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:15.280]
Seasoned paysock and a happy New Year and a happy as some of our story and all of these things

[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:19.820]
Halleux did not specify what problems were holding up with the withdrawal which both the defense minister

[01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:22.680]
Amir Perret said should be completed by tonight by this evening

[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:26.040]
Hopefully before sundown if not forget about it

[01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:28.600]
Remember during that the madness that was going on?

[01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:32.520]
We couldn't have a cabinet meeting to approve the ceasefire because it was the way it was shabbos

[01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:36.180]
But they could still keep killing people and bombing like crazy and doing those things

[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:42.800]
Meanwhile Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haneyeh Haneyeh what does his name?

[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:46.460]
Yes is a boss no he know the prime minister. He's the president

[01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:51.440]
You better get your Palestinian leader straight now mister for you guy you wouldn't know they were asked for my elbow

[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:56.020]
They all looked at say the video he smells the same Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haneyeh of Hamas said today

[01:28:56.020 --> 01:29:01.400]
He will not have a government they recognize as Israel striking a potential blow to President Mahmoud Abbas is a

[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:06.200]
National unity government however if the UN today he's still Hawking Hamas

[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.400]
BOSS, Hamasaboss, that what he's going to do is he's going to form his own government

[01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:14.260]
and kick the Hamas out of it if they won't recognize Israel.

[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:19.100]
His ready government spokeswoman, Mary Eisen, reiterated Israel's demand to any Palestinian

[01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:22.120]
government, yield for the demands of the international community of Eisen.

[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:24.680]
I wonder if that's Mrs. Eisen or Mr. Eisen.

[01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:25.680]
That's possible.

[01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:27.560]
Remember the Eisen car alarm?

[01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:28.260]

Can't we order to get a bunch of finished babies?

[01:29:56.240 --> 01:29:57.180]

It's totally unprofessional.

[01:31:57.980 --> 01:31:59.660]
You are an idiot.

[01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:00.960]
You're a fat idiot.

Thank you fellow astronauts there.

Don't remember that?

[01:32:59.480 --> 01:32:59.840]
Are you there?

[01:33:00.540 --> 01:33:04.080]
Yeah I was shut off because I was doing a little bit of a spotty production here.

[01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:05.660]
What does that mean?

[01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:06.760]
Spotty my ass.

What are you talking about?

[01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:11.860]

[01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:13.740]

[01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:16.780]
It must be Allison's fault.

[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:19.380]
Would you leave him alone Allison and quit grabbing on his ass?

[01:33:20.540 --> 01:33:20.980]

[01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:23.820]
All over him like stink on Joyce.

[01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:25.780]
Just get there a lot of there.

[01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:26.860]
That's going to stay there.

[01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:27.460]
Really p.o.

[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:31.860]
In the upcoming issue of Rolling Stone Environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,

[01:33:32.380 --> 01:33:33.040]
Bobby Kennedy Jr.

[01:33:33.340 --> 01:33:36.960]
along with award winning writer Dick Russell, deepened his investigation in America's

[01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:40.660]
electoral process following the debacle of the 2000 presidential election,

[01:33:40.660 --> 01:33:45.100]
tough screen voting machines promised to make voting as easy and reliable as with Ron Cash from

[01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:46.300]
ATM, the press release dates.

[01:33:46.700 --> 01:33:51.020]
In 2002, privately owned die-bowl, the world's third largest seller of eight

[01:33:51.020 --> 01:33:55.960]
teams was awarded a contract to install 19,000 voting machines across the state of Georgia,

[01:33:56.420 --> 01:33:59.700]
even though it's bid was the highest among nine competing vendors and it had only

[01:33:59.700 --> 01:34:03.280]
recently completed the acquisition of global election systems, a voting machine from

[01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:05.860]
the own technology die-bowl was promising to sell Georgia.

[01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:10.300]
But as November's high stakes midterm elections approach, electronic voting machines

[01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:13.100]
are making things worse instead of better according to the press release.

[01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:17.480]
Studies have demonstrated that hackers can easily bring the technology to fix

[01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:20.080]
an election which Blue Dabs has been demonstrating on CNN by the way.

[01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:23.940]
And across the country this year, Faudi equipment and lack security have repeatedly

[01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:25.320]
under my election primaries.

[01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:29.300]
In the article Kennedy interviews former die-bowl consultant Chris Huda reveals

[01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:31.460]
what extent are right to vote as at risk.

[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:35.060]
The article will be online tomorrow at RollingStone.com.

[01:34:35.100 --> 01:34:36.780]
Let's see, was this day that yesterday or today?

[01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:39.120]
Now it's online today, RollingStone.com, the whole thing.

[01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:42.380]
With some excerpts in late July to speed deployment of the new machines,

[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:45.940]
Cox quietly signed an agreement with Diebold that effectively privatized

[01:34:45.940 --> 01:34:47.320]
Georgia's entire electoral system.

[01:34:47.700 --> 01:34:51.300]
The company was authorized to put together ballots, program machines, and train poll workers

[01:34:51.300 --> 01:34:53.940]
across the state all without any official supervision.

[01:34:54.460 --> 01:34:55.720]
We ran the elections as to it.

[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.760]
We had 256 people that Diebold brought on the state.

[01:34:59.140 --> 01:35:00.880]
They opened and closed the poll and then integrated the votes.

[01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:04.900]
Diebold commenced Cox that would be best if the company ran everything due to the time constraints

[01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:07.720]
and in the interest of a trouble for the election, she let us do it.

[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:13.100]
Then one muggy day in mid-August, Huda was surprised to see the president of Diebold's election unit, Bob

[01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:15.700]
Eurosovich, arrived in Georgia from his headquarters in Texas.

[01:35:16.340 --> 01:35:19.520]
When the primary's little mini-Eurosovich was personally distributing a patch,

[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:23.280]
a little piece of software designed to correct glitches in the computer program,

[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:26.740]
we were told it was intended to fix the clock and the system, which it did not do,

[01:35:26.860 --> 01:35:30.540]
who had said the curious thing is the very swift covert way this was done.

[01:35:34.140 --> 01:35:38.300]
Georgia law mandates that any change made in voting machines would be certified by the state,

[01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:42.440]
but thanks to Cox's agreement with Diebold, the company was essentially not a certified self.

[01:35:42.700 --> 01:35:46.640]
It was an unauthorized patch and they were trying to keep it a secret from the statehood told me.

[01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:49.700]
We were told not to talk to county personnel about it.

[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:52.020]
I received instructions directly from Eurosovich.

[01:35:52.020 --> 01:35:55.880]
He said it was very unusual that the president of the company would give an order like that

[01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:56.920]
and be involved at that level.

[01:35:57.180 --> 01:35:58.520]
Don't ever give an order like that again.

[01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:00.920]
Remember that? Maybe they should fear you.

[01:36:01.380 --> 01:36:06.760]
According to the hood, Diebold employs altered software in some 5,000 machines into Calvin Fulton counties

[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:08.520]
to state's largest democratic strongholds.

[01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:13.620]
To avoid detection of hood and others on his team, entered warehouses early in the morning.

[01:36:13.980 --> 01:36:18.540]
We went in at 730 in the morning where I bought my livelihoods and there was a universal key to unlock the machines.

[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:21.800]
It's easy to get access. The machines in the warehouses were unlocked.

[01:36:21.980 --> 01:36:22.900]
We had control of everything.

[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:26.660]
The state gave us the keys to the castle so to speak and they stayed out of our way.

[01:36:26.660 --> 01:36:32.000]
Hood personally passed 56 machines and witnessed the pass being applied to more than 1,200 others.

[01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:37.440]
Rolling Stones article of Robert Kennedy, it's on the RollingStone.com.

[01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:40.580]
RFK. Got it? Got it.

[01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:42.820]
I mean, no. Not that anybody's going to do anything about it.

[01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:43.780]
Democrats certainly aren't.

[01:36:44.020 --> 01:36:45.980]
Now it's only now that Kury has screaming about Ohio.

[01:36:46.580 --> 01:36:51.160]
Now here we are two years later and he finally caught on that they stole Ohio from him.

[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:52.400]
A little bit slow, Johnny Boy.

[01:36:52.900 --> 01:36:55.340]
You're not so swift as the swift voters might say.

[01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:57.560]
God, even Jonathan was more swift.

[01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:01.040]
Now if Kury could have just gotten them little appusions to vote for him.

[01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:03.640]
Let's see. Do not go see that awful.

[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:04.920]
Well, let's see. It's not in the figures anymore.

[01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:06.840]
But don't buy it. Don't rent it. Don't see it on cable.

[01:37:07.260 --> 01:37:08.780]
Silent Hill. Even if you play the game.

[01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:12.880]
309. You won't be silent very long after it went it in.

[01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:17.340]
You might enjoy it during even if you even hear one of those people that likes to be buried in ashes all day.

[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:19.380]
You know, like if you didn't enjoy that.

[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:20.940]
But when it gets to the ending, you're going to say,

[01:37:20.940 --> 01:37:22.520]
what? What just happened there?

[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:24.420]
What just happened there folks?

[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:26.700]
I should probably spoil it and tell me how.

[01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:29.940]
It wouldn't make any difference because it doesn't shed any light on it.

[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.180]
The only light is in the camera.

[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:33.080]
You know, everything is real bright.

[01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:34.480]
You know, like, oh, we're in heaven now.

[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:35.820]
We're like, who knows where we are.

[01:37:36.220 --> 01:37:37.500]
We're like being in hell that ending.

[01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:40.300]
And then the husband wakes up on the sofa there and the door is open.

[01:37:40.620 --> 01:37:41.960]
And he looks around. I ain't nobody there.

[01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:45.320]
And then we go out to that nice scene in the garden and the rain is pushing down.

[01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:46.120]
Huh?

[01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:47.280]
Yeah.

[01:37:48.900 --> 01:37:50.020]
Oh, no kidding.

[01:37:50.660 --> 01:37:51.880]
I'm just rooting for people.

[01:37:52.140 --> 01:37:55.040]
Good. Rooted so that nobody will waste their time watching us two hours long.

[01:37:55.180 --> 01:37:58.720]
It feels like about a five hour marathon of, uh, Savior time.

[01:37:58.860 --> 01:37:59.520]
You'll want it back.

[01:37:59.780 --> 01:38:01.280]
You say Savior? Savior?

[01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:03.300]
309 votes on the parade.

[01:38:03.860 --> 01:38:04.820]
Who is your favorite commentator?

[01:38:05.780 --> 01:38:07.020]
Keith Olberman, 118.

[01:38:07.220 --> 01:38:08.600]
Nobody code close to Keith.

[01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:10.380]
Nice. That is sweet.

[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:12.540]
Don't have one, 52. Well, get one.

[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:13.500]
If you don't have one, get one.

[01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:15.080]
Go to the nearest bar and tie one on.

[01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:15.800]
Idiot.

[01:38:16.100 --> 01:38:17.660]
Marine Dow 37. She's sweet.

[01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:18.320]
He's great.

[01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:20.220]
Phil O'Reilly 8, uh, 17.

[01:38:21.100 --> 01:38:21.820]
That's frightening.

[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.060]
Lou Dobbs 13. Tony Harris don't have any.

[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:25.060]
And since it's just as well.

[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:27.420]
Doug Thompson 13. See, I read that article.

[01:38:27.540 --> 01:38:28.120]
Now he's moving up.

[01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:30.740]
I hate this 12, 12, 3.7%.

[01:38:30.740 --> 01:38:32.380]
Doug, a great past 10.

[01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:34.100]
Molly Ivan's 10. Rush Limbaugh 10.

[01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:34.560]
Uh-huh.

[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:35.760]
Frank Rich 10.

[01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:37.300]
Paul Krugman 5.

[01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:38.560]
Captain of Andy and who will four.

[01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:40.400]
Michael Medvitz still got two good.

[01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:41.280]
Don't vote for him.

[01:38:41.460 --> 01:38:41.980]
Well, coming.

[01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:43.580]
Nail your ass right to the wall.

[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:45.500]
What is a nice looking Savior there?

[01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:46.460]
Stand behind the president.

[01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:48.580]
David Corn 2 Tom Hartman 2.

[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:49.620]
David Broder's got one.

[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:51.320]
Thomas Friedman's got one.

[01:38:51.580 --> 01:38:51.720]
Yeah.

[01:38:51.980 --> 01:38:54.340]
Like I said, it must be Wolf Flitzkrieg or some similarly

[01:38:54.340 --> 01:38:55.520]
fanatical Zionist.

[01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:58.220]
Robert Fisk, David Brooks and John Nichols have still got

[01:38:58.220 --> 01:38:59.200]
out of 300 plus votes.

[01:38:59.280 --> 01:38:59.920]
Oh, they go.

[01:39:00.180 --> 01:39:01.240]
They don't know who those people are.

[01:39:01.740 --> 01:39:03.640]
I guess I'm wasting my time putting their articles on our

[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:03.760]
web.

[01:39:03.860 --> 01:39:05.140]
Or maybe they just don't like their articles.

[01:39:05.300 --> 01:39:07.260]
Or maybe they like them, but not as much as somebody else.

[01:39:07.700 --> 01:39:09.120]
Just because they didn't get any votes.

[01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:10.720]
Oh, Pam, uh, look at this.

[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:12.440]
Don't forget to watch 60 Minutes this Sunday.

[01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:12.900]
Right.

[01:39:13.060 --> 01:39:15.280]
When I share a few things on there talking about how, uh,

[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:18.180]
the US threatened his ass about bombing them back into the

[01:39:18.180 --> 01:39:18.660]
Stone Age.

[01:39:19.260 --> 01:39:22.220]
This ought to be one of the big, I mean, this is just scandalous.

[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:23.740]
It's, uh, there's armoured.

[01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:24.180]
I just tried.

[01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:25.020]
I came back up.

[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:28.540]
Uh, I think there may have been some surprise in a part of

[01:39:28.540 --> 01:39:30.600]
the gun of a good old long associated.

[01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:31.100]
Yeah.

[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:31.420]
Yeah.

[01:39:31.460 --> 01:39:32.620]
You freaking liar, man.

[01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:36.060]
This guy's got selective Alzheimer's is what he's got between,

[01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:39.300]
you know, Valerie Plain and the name game and all this other crap.

[01:39:39.780 --> 01:39:40.800]
Man, what a crook.

[01:39:41.460 --> 01:39:43.600]
Kinky Friedman is in hot water again, man.

[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:45.540]
Can't keep his ass out of hot water.

[01:39:46.420 --> 01:39:47.180]
Remember Kinky Friedman?

[01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:47.800]
Sure.

[01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:48.440]
Couple of jib.

[01:39:48.820 --> 01:39:50.360]
Has thrived on brash commentary,

[01:39:50.580 --> 01:39:52.040]
Allanda Shatara and crude humor.

[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:57.140]
But some critics say the independent candidate for governor has gone too far with his comments about African Americans,

[01:39:57.740 --> 01:39:59.480]
which he seems to be having a habit of that.

[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:01.240]
I already looked pretty cute in the habit.

[01:40:01.860 --> 01:40:07.400]
Friedman in a video clip that someone's opponents began circulating Tuesday calls the word Negro-A-Charming word

[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:11.520]
and uses it in explanation of what he would do to the sexual predators if he selected in November.

[01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:15.260]
Although in previous books of tongue he's used another N word.

[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:16.200]
Couple of times.

[01:40:16.580 --> 01:40:18.380]
New Negro is a step up for him, isn't it?

[01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:19.860]
I say, he just learned how to say that.

[01:40:20.340 --> 01:40:24.020]
Throw them in prison and throw away the key and make them listen to a Negro talking to himself,

[01:40:24.020 --> 01:40:27.140]
even said in the interview, with CNBC broadcast late last year.

[01:40:27.460 --> 01:40:33.440]
The comments hardly made a splash at the time, but the video posted on youtube.com is sparking fresh criticism that's on you.

[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:33.680]
You.

[01:40:34.620 --> 01:40:39.020]
Last week Friedman came under fire for calling Katrina evacuees in Houston thugs and crackheads.

[01:40:39.020 --> 01:40:43.940]
Critics said he'd unfairly stereotyped the evacuees who are disproportionately black as criminals.

[01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:45.780]
Not that he's a racist, you understand.

[01:40:46.660 --> 01:40:53.700]
Friedman offered no apologies then or now saying he's generating controversy only because he's doing something silver in politics today telling it like it is.

[01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:58.400]
Anyone who feels that anything is offensive about this should definitely vote for one of the other three candidates he said.

[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:03.840]
If you've got a lot of people sweep the truth under the rug and worry about offending people, I'm not going to be very effective, he said.

[01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:08.220]
And he said he's got no regrets about using the word Negro and stands by his remarks.

[01:41:08.220 --> 01:41:21.560]
State Representative Gardner Coleman, Democratic Houston media past chairman of the black caucus in the Texas legislature said Friedman's inflammatory comments are a prophetic attempt to appeal to a narrow-minded Texas group in his effort to unseat Republican governor Rick Perry.

[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:24.220]
Never mind the Texan.

[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:28.100]
You don't mean the Bush family do I thought they're from Connecticut.

[01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:34.600]
The biggest name of the best talent to be this is Neil Rogers, 43560.

[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:55.860]
The G.O.P. Bucket is all white meat right wings and only 2995.

[01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:10.360]
They're back your favorite Jewish rock and roll the soundtrack band is Russia Shana with their greatest hits album, Sakaapas the synagogue.

[01:42:18.220 --> 01:42:24.500]
Yes, Russia Shana and I is reformed to bring you 12 kosher cuts of poppin Hebrew hygiene.

[01:42:32.900 --> 01:42:39.660]
This album should be in every orthodox rockers collection rolling stone gets it five stars of David.

[01:42:39.660 --> 01:42:57.360]
The voice was definitely prudent.

[01:42:58.080 --> 01:43:02.740]
Japanese New Year, baby. Don't forget to like the candles and say a bracha for all of us.

[01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:05.680]
About 33, oh I'm heading for Lauderdale, I hate to disagree with you Ed.

[01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:10.040]
He says, please add, lester a whole for the list, not only does he have a great voice, he does an excellent interview.

[01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:15.540]
Well, the question is, your favorite columnist or commentator, and he is neither.

[01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:20.200]
He's an interviewer, he's a newsreader, he does have a great voice, I love lester a whole.

[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:26.060]
And instead of having a weekend on today's show or wherever they bury him, he didn't belong on that pool.

[01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:28.800]
Okay, George Stillers, no who he is.

[01:43:28.980 --> 01:43:33.340]
Who? I'm embarrassed. Marisa, I don't know if you like him, but I'd like you to add Al Frankenley,

[01:43:33.620 --> 01:43:35.520]
pull for your long time pal.

[01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:38.300]
Let's get Al Franken there, that's good.

[01:43:38.700 --> 01:43:42.840]
And let's say we can put a large ass limbo on there, speaking of large ass limbo, get Al Franken on please.

[01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:46.540]
Thank you. Go on, Alison, they'll tell you from your reported rounds there, Josh.

[01:43:46.980 --> 01:43:48.080]
What did he say about that?

[01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:50.940]
I just kidding around. What is it wrong with you, man?

[01:43:51.340 --> 01:43:55.200]
Because he said before when he was out of the room that he wasn't doing an age-dose trace in Quattro,

[01:43:55.420 --> 01:43:57.440]
he was in there doing Alison or something, and that was you said?

[01:43:57.640 --> 01:43:58.460]
That's exactly what he said.

[01:43:58.460 --> 01:44:01.480]
Yes, something like that. I don't know what she looks like, I have no idea.

[01:44:02.380 --> 01:44:05.720]
And because there's obviously a pause there, then unless said the better, I don't know.

[01:44:06.020 --> 01:44:06.120]
What?

[01:44:06.900 --> 01:44:10.620]
A crying, now this is by Jeff Cohen, no not the one from the pizza joint.

[01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:15.720]
You know, it's so tempting, but I'm just, like you said, I don't care, I just don't care.

[01:44:16.660 --> 01:44:19.640]
And I mean, when Duff, when I ask him about that thing, you know, that you were there,

[01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:21.820]
and oh, they're not returning my emails.

[01:44:23.340 --> 01:44:24.300]
What's the use, huh?

[01:44:24.700 --> 01:44:27.500]
If they don't care, I don't care. It's just one of those things.

[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:29.400]
Just keep the checks coming, George has got it.

[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:32.080]
I keep saying that I've been saying it for about three, four years now,

[01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:35.420]
but it's only at this point the last few days that I've decided you are correct.

[01:44:36.100 --> 01:44:36.600]
I tell you.

[01:44:36.740 --> 01:44:40.900]
Jeff Cohen in the Smircling Chimp Rights, across the US political and media spectrum,

[01:44:40.900 --> 01:44:45.460]
there was wide agreement yesterday, name calling and personal ties are a bad for national and global dialogue.

[01:44:45.460 --> 01:44:51.720]
Promoting the unity were Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's comments that President Bush was the devil incarnate, L.D. Abolo.

[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:57.160]
Among those exercises and exercise about Chavez's name calling were some of the loudest name callers in America,

[01:44:57.160 --> 01:45:00.400]
and media today, including Rush Limbaugh and other right wing talk hosts.

[01:45:00.940 --> 01:45:05.140]
Limbaugh tried to equate Chavez remarks with the alleged Bush bashing that comes from top US Democrats,

[01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:10.000]
in case you forgot it was Limbaugh who ridiculed Chelsea Clinton, then 13, as the White House dog.

[01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:17.500]
It was Limbaugh in 2001 who routinely referred to Democratic leader Tom Dashel literally as L.D. Abolo.

[01:45:17.940 --> 01:45:24.180]
Along with devil and a blood-dressed theme music, Limbaugh would carry on at length about how Dashel may well be Satan in the soft-spoken disguise.

[01:45:24.700 --> 01:45:31.280]
Fellow Limbaugh in July of 2001, just yesterday as Bush waned his way to Europe on a crucial mission to lead our allies in the 21st century,

[01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:34.520]
up pops L.D. Abolo, Tom Dashel in his devilish devil tree,

[01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:36.920]
claiming that George Bush is incompetent.

[01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:43.240]
Months later, Limbaugh started describing Dashel more as a traitor than a devil who decided to align himself with the Randolph-Korea and Hussein.

[01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:48.520]
Also, in sense by Chavez, was MSNBC host and former GOP Congressman Joe Scarborough,

[01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:52.340]
who last night played a lengthy excerpt of Limbaugh, pontificating about the Chavez remarks.

[01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:56.400]
Somehow Scarborough couldn't dig up the tapes of Limbaugh declaring that Dashel was the devil.

[01:45:56.880 --> 01:45:59.960]
In my new book, Cable News Confidential, My Misadventures and Corporate Media,

[01:46:00.340 --> 01:46:05.900]
I dissect the hypocrisy of a TV news business that is long-cated to hateful writers like Patrick Cannon,

[01:46:05.900 --> 01:46:13.080]
Jerry Falwell and Anne Colter, and TV-Land Vicious Epiphanelers gets a defined announce-out number to sound as progressives as the name-callers.

[01:46:13.460 --> 01:46:18.860]
When I worked at MSNBC on Phil Donahue's Prime-time show, management often complained that Phil, who never named called,

[01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:24.120]
and was one of the most courteous host in TV history, was badgering guests. His patriotism was questioned.

[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:31.400]
As the Iraq invasion neared, an internal NBC management memo described Donahue as a difficult public face for NBC in the time of war.

[01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:35.640]
Why, because he insisted on presenting guests who were skeptical of the administration's motives?

[01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:42.700]
With Donahue terminated on the eve of the war MSNBC brass turned a host like Scarborough and talk radio, big-it Michael Savage,

[01:46:43.100 --> 01:46:46.880]
known for his declarations that development countries like Venezuela were turred world nations,

[01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:50.520]
that the Latino is breed-like rabbits, and that women should have been denied the vote.

[01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:55.120]
In a TV industry that had been on playcating the far right, Donahue was a difficult public face for NBC,

[01:46:55.620 --> 01:46:57.420]
but Savage was deemed an acceptable face.

[01:46:57.420 --> 01:47:02.300]
Three weeks in the Iraq war, Scarborough was gleeful at boycotts and cancellations aimed at anti-war elite,

[01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:05.780]
like Jean Gragfalo, Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon.

[01:47:06.340 --> 01:47:11.060]
And as a guest on Scarborough show Savage declared that Hollywood idiots were absolutely committing sedition and treason,

[01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:16.300]
responded, Scarborough, these leftist, doges for anti-American causes are always given a free pass.

[01:47:16.860 --> 01:47:22.260]
Let me be clear, those of us who use facts instead of rant, reason and argument instead of name-calling and personal attacks,

[01:47:22.620 --> 01:47:25.080]
evidence instead of intimidation and accusations of this lawy,

[01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:28.440]
we have the moral authority to tell Hugo Chavez that his comments are out of line.

[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:32.380]
But the limbaugh's Hannity, Scarborough's, nor Riley's are in no position to point any fingers,

[01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:37.620]
nor are the executives of Disney, GE and News Corp who have made them the loudest voices in American media.

[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:44.940]
Nor for that matter was Team Bush, whose strategy has been to demonize and intimidate critics and other members of the so-called reality-based community.

[01:47:46.260 --> 01:47:50.540]
Take reality based on the truth, as opposed to the dream world that they want us to all be in.

[01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:51.780]
The fantasy world.

[01:47:52.300 --> 01:47:53.340]
Everything is just fine.

[01:47:53.780 --> 01:47:54.800]
Oh, we're fine.

[01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:54.980]
We're fine.

[01:47:54.980 --> 01:47:55.640]
But they're just fine.

[01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:57.060]
It's pathetic.

[01:47:57.740 --> 01:47:58.960]
Let's see how the poll is coming.

[01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:01.020]
We got, let's see, 955 and what?

[01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:01.880]
Huh?

[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:03.120]
You asking me a math question?

[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:04.520]
367.

[01:48:04.620 --> 01:48:05.340]
But that's pretty good.

[01:48:05.940 --> 01:48:08.580]
Are you kidding me on the first day of Russian Shundra tonight?

[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:10.280]
1322, man.

[01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:13.400]
We're going to make, well I think we could do 1500 again today, we would do two together.

[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:14.840]
And of course there would be those there.

[01:48:14.860 --> 01:48:17.780]
Well, I'd just cheat, you know, you got two different poll-quite, you know, two bad, you mama.

[01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:19.020]
That's my comment.

[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:20.060]
Two freaking bad.

[01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:23.320]
Two bad about that kissing, two bad about the private radio station.

[01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:24.120]
Yeah.

[01:48:24.620 --> 01:48:26.780]
But they didn't wait any time on that.

[01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:30.680]
They send the engineers right over there in wherever the hell I was in a trailer park in the day-to-year-wherever.

[01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:32.220]
And they grabbed that guy.

[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:33.700]
I want to give you a kiss.

[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:39.300]
I'd like to know when they're going to send the engineers down to Cuba to give it out to the lecture or Raul, whoever's in charge this week.

[01:48:39.300 --> 01:48:43.360]
And about the Cuban interference we keep getting because they run 80 billion watts.

[01:48:43.820 --> 01:48:44.480]
Yeah, that'd be something.

[01:48:44.940 --> 01:48:45.060]
Yeah.

[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:46.300]
When they're going to send those losers.

[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:49.240]
In fact, you know, Fixed, he likes to travel.

[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:49.720]
Right.

[01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:52.640]
Then a sluff in an eye, a falls in one and become up here and messed with my board here.

[01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:54.580]
See, I didn't want him touching stuff in here.

[01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:56.080]
Now, I'm sure you can understand that.

[01:48:56.460 --> 01:48:56.680]
I do.

[01:48:57.420 --> 01:48:57.880]
He did.

[01:48:57.880 --> 01:48:57.940]
He did.

[01:48:57.940 --> 01:48:58.580]
He did his good idea.

[01:48:58.800 --> 01:48:59.360]
And when he saw it.

[01:48:59.780 --> 01:49:00.600]
Yeah, then that's right.

[01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:01.660]
He did his coolies on it.

[01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:03.960]
And some of them imported from the old days at IOD.

[01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:07.700]
But yeah, he probably caught up here from Steve Ziegler, no doubt.

[01:49:09.340 --> 01:49:10.600]
Steve, you said that Ziegler.

[01:49:10.740 --> 01:49:10.980]
He was a screwdriver.

[01:49:11.580 --> 01:49:11.880]
Oh, yeah.

[01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:14.180]
In my life, I've been in this business for about 100 years.

[01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:16.840]
I've never seen an engineer who you've walked around with his Ziegler.

[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:17.920]
That was it.

[01:49:18.020 --> 01:49:19.380]
That was his only tool, so to speak.

[01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:20.480]
Yeah, this big screwdriver.

[01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:22.600]
And he would hold it up like in a menacing way.

[01:49:22.780 --> 01:49:23.640]
Like, you better watch it.

[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:24.320]
I might use this.

[01:49:24.460 --> 01:49:25.800]
Well, you never know when you've got a twist on.

[01:49:28.540 --> 01:49:30.460]
But yeah, we can get the engineer from here to do that.

[01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:30.880]
He's great.

[01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:31.920]
He knows what he's doing.

[01:49:32.020 --> 01:49:33.340]
And he wouldn't mess up this place.

[01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:36.260]
Because everything is so clean and pristine for the old queen.

[01:49:36.260 --> 01:49:37.240]
It's just great.

[01:49:37.620 --> 01:49:40.200]
I apologize, by the way, for getting that freaks and geeks out of here.

[01:49:40.580 --> 01:49:42.260]
Not to anybody else just to myself.

[01:49:42.260 --> 01:49:44.920]
I don't know anything to anybody, which is I apologize to myself.

[01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:48.500]
Because I look at the pictures and I say, what is this?

[01:49:48.740 --> 01:49:50.440]
Like you said, it's like saved by the bell.

[01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:52.280]
Oh, God.

[01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:55.180]
Man, that's an embarrassment.

[01:49:55.620 --> 01:49:58.820]
But I'll make an exception because James Franco is in it.

[01:49:59.420 --> 01:49:59.820]
And we'll see.

[01:49:59.940 --> 01:50:03.040]
We'll see if it's Franco-American, which of course they make to be eaten.

[01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:05.680]
Who is your favorite columnist or commentator?

[01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:06.800]
You're right.

[01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:08.040]
They still don't understand the question.

[01:50:08.220 --> 01:50:09.220]
Even in the world here.

[01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:10.380]
Don't forget name recognition.

[01:50:10.540 --> 01:50:12.780]
See those two right-wing lunatics you have on there.

[01:50:13.100 --> 01:50:15.140]
Very, very famous as opposed to some of these other people.

[01:50:15.300 --> 01:50:18.240]
That would be like, how about let's put an colter on there.

[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:19.080]
You want to put an iron there?

[01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:19.360]
Sure.

[01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:20.040]
It's a lute in here.

[01:50:20.180 --> 01:50:21.900]
I could go grotesque dupe to the top.

[01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:22.760]
Dikey ass.

[01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:23.680]
Yeah, put an iron there.

[01:50:24.100 --> 01:50:25.160]
Put man colter on there.

[01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:27.060]
Keith Oberman, 132.

[01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:28.540]
I'm pleased as punched to see that.

[01:50:29.380 --> 01:50:32.080]
You know, it's not a case of monkey-seen, monkey-do.

[01:50:32.220 --> 01:50:33.520]
You know, like they think my taste in music.

[01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:35.240]
It's a person, sometimes I taste in movies, yes.

[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:36.020]
Look at this.

[01:50:36.260 --> 01:50:40.020]
You know, but the fact is that he's the only hope that's on there.

[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:42.580]
I mean, he doesn't show where he does rips some bashes these people

[01:50:42.580 --> 01:50:44.680]
and tells it like it is day after day.

[01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:45.720]
And he doesn't give a crap.

[01:50:46.380 --> 01:50:47.540]
Keith Oberman, 132.

[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:48.620]
Don't have 162.

[01:50:48.780 --> 01:50:49.660]
Maureen Dowd, 44.

[01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:51.760]
Way on down to Biddle Riley, 19.

[01:50:51.900 --> 01:50:52.740]
I hate this poll, 18.

[01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:53.540]
Lute Dowd, 15.

[01:50:53.820 --> 01:50:54.760]
Doug Thompson, 14.

[01:50:55.160 --> 01:50:56.060]
Molly Evans, 13.

[01:50:56.500 --> 01:50:57.840]
Locked it up, the down is got 13.

[01:50:58.260 --> 01:50:58.920]
Greg Polis, 10.

[01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:00.460]
Frank Richson, Paul Corbin, 7.

[01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:02.100]
Katrina Van Hovel, 4.

[01:51:02.100 --> 01:51:03.340]
Tom Hartman, 3.

[01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:04.220]
Al Franken, 2.

[01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:06.300]
You know, I haven't been putting very many stories from the Nation

[01:51:06.300 --> 01:51:06.660]
on there lately.

[01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:07.400]
I guess I forgot.

[01:51:08.140 --> 01:51:10.520]
So I guess I'll have to add some extra ones on there for Josh this weekend.

[01:51:10.820 --> 01:51:11.220]
Just kidding.

[01:51:11.380 --> 01:51:11.920]
Just a joke.

[01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:13.140]
It's just a joke.

[01:51:13.640 --> 01:51:13.960]
Come on.

[01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:15.180]
I sure hope so.

[01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:16.520]
Michael Medved, 2.

[01:51:16.640 --> 01:51:17.400]
David Korn, 2.

[01:51:17.540 --> 01:51:18.500]
That Korn sure is special.

[01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:20.160]
David Broder still got that one.

[01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:21.580]
Probably from Hermione Gingold.

[01:51:22.020 --> 01:51:22.800]
She would vote for him.

[01:51:23.220 --> 01:51:24.180]
Thomas Freeman's got one.

[01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:25.120]
I've got to be a joke vote.

[01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:26.180]
They must like his mustache.

[01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:27.700]
And Kolder went on there.

[01:51:27.780 --> 01:51:30.880]
She's got non-Robert Fisk and David Brooks and John Nichol still have the big-o.

[01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:33.840]
Out of 370, that's almost great.

[01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:38.460]
The biggest reason we have best talent in this is in Angel Rogers, 4.

[01:51:38.620 --> 01:51:39.280]
205.

[01:51:39.420 --> 01:51:39.520]
6.

[01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:40.060]
4.

[01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:40.460]
8.

[01:51:42.700 --> 01:51:43.360]
Mabaloo.

[01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:51.260]
If anybody has a opinion, then it's sending from our way.

[01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:58.660]
In a place your name and through the system, I tend to me out this day.

[01:51:59.660 --> 01:52:06.220]
And those different fathers who quest, yeah, just follow and don't fail.

[01:52:08.420 --> 01:52:10.980]
Everybody's finding bad news.

[01:52:12.080 --> 01:52:13.820]
That's just US days.

[01:52:15.220 --> 01:52:18.280]
Oh, in the act of history, yeah.

[01:52:19.200 --> 01:52:21.120]
They're watching all of you.

[01:52:23.060 --> 01:52:25.800]
Everyone does a shakian.

[01:52:25.800 --> 01:52:28.680]
So why can't you see?

[01:52:30.500 --> 01:52:36.640]
These kinds of formation, under your mightless rules,

[01:52:38.420 --> 01:52:44.360]
in which other nations attach to a saying.

[01:52:45.620 --> 01:52:47.980]
And they gotta hate those truths.

[01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:51.540]
And clinging to Barrow's truth.

[01:52:52.540 --> 01:52:56.120]
That's what we believe everything we tell you.

[01:52:57.440 --> 01:52:58.640]
Under state rules.

[01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:04.020]
Bloodwater for cornbread.

[01:53:04.740 --> 01:53:06.820]
Build up your escondays.

[01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:10.940]
A roof and seiny bush venue.

[01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:13.960]
Backstews, say.

[01:53:15.820 --> 01:53:18.900]
We don't mind you see our jobs go.

[01:53:18.900 --> 01:53:22.120]
A bunch of times of these wounds.

[01:53:23.620 --> 01:53:25.640]
We're fascin' ain't it by a chain?

[01:53:26.020 --> 01:53:29.700]
No, don't be so stupid, wounds.

[01:53:31.260 --> 01:53:33.360]
All the hour is racing.

[01:53:34.900 --> 01:53:37.400]
The fact of the earth can wait.

[01:53:38.260 --> 01:53:41.500]
And everybody's turning back, yeah.

[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:44.360]
Backstews, say.

[01:53:46.220 --> 01:53:47.320]
What do you think?

[01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:49.400]
Wouldn't you change in your reforming, I think?

[01:53:49.480 --> 01:53:56.960]
I think the security castle being made up with the five victors of World War II.

[01:53:57.640 --> 01:53:59.580]
That happened 60 years ago.

[01:54:00.180 --> 01:54:01.480]
And it's time to move on.

[01:54:01.600 --> 01:54:08.000]
And I think that we ought to allow more members and better representation on the security castle.

[01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:09.420]
Let's get a look at the scene.

[01:54:09.420 --> 01:54:10.060]
And then what do you say?

[01:54:10.200 --> 01:54:11.380]
That's Ted Turner, your boy.

[01:54:11.780 --> 01:54:13.900]
There's a newfound boy after it was great comments yesterday.

[01:54:14.100 --> 01:54:15.160]
There's another government of Big Peer.

[01:54:15.540 --> 01:54:17.640]
When you got his money, you can afford to have a big peer.

[01:54:17.780 --> 01:54:19.660]
Open up a big mouth and tell him what it is.

[01:54:20.100 --> 01:54:22.120]
If he doesn't like it, he'll like your order of hit.

[01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:25.220]
Patrick Coburn in the independent UK rights.

[01:54:25.460 --> 01:54:27.420]
New terror that stalks the Rex Republic of Fear.

[01:54:27.680 --> 01:54:28.920]
You want to know what's really going on over there.

[01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:30.720]
And you notice how interesting it is.

[01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:32.460]
I mentioned this two years ago.

[01:54:32.940 --> 01:54:33.880]
And then last year again.

[01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:34.540]
And here it is.

[01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:37.020]
It's like almost the end of September 2006.

[01:54:37.380 --> 01:54:41.540]
And we still see very, very, very, very little live footage.

[01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:44.920]
Or even tape footage of like day and day life in Iraq.

[01:54:45.140 --> 01:54:45.600]
You notice that?

[01:54:45.820 --> 01:54:46.260]
I have.

[01:54:46.660 --> 01:54:47.620]
All the networks are there.

[01:54:47.940 --> 01:54:48.100]
Hey.

[01:54:48.140 --> 01:54:50.360]
Everybody's like cowering behind the trucks.

[01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:52.600]
You see everything you need to see, kind of.

[01:54:53.140 --> 01:54:53.420]
Yeah.

[01:54:53.900 --> 01:54:55.620]
Well, maybe now we'll hear some what we need to hear.

[01:54:56.040 --> 01:54:57.600]
The Republic of Fear is born again.

[01:54:57.740 --> 01:55:00.980]
The state of terror now gripping Iraq as bad as it was on the Saddam Hussein.

[01:55:00.980 --> 01:55:03.800]
Torture in the country may even be worse than it was during his rule.

[01:55:03.900 --> 01:55:05.800]
The UN Special Investigator on torture so yesterday.

[01:55:06.140 --> 01:55:07.920]
And this is about manfred no whack again.

[01:55:08.480 --> 01:55:12.140]
This situation is so bad many people say it's worse than it had been in times of Saddam Hussein.

[01:55:12.540 --> 01:55:15.740]
The report from an even-handed senior UN official is in Shabkhan,

[01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:17.840]
traced with the hopes of George Bush and Tony Blair.

[01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:22.600]
But in 2003 they promised to bring democracy and respect for human rights to the people of Iraq.

[01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:25.980]
The brutal tortures committed in the prisons of the regime overthrown in 2003

[01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:30.040]
are being emulated and surpassed in the detention centers of the present US

[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:31.820]
and British-backed Iraqi government.

[01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:36.960]
The Tini's body shows signs of beating, using electric cables, wounds, and different parts of their bodies,

[01:55:37.140 --> 01:55:41.840]
including the head and genitals, broken bones of legs and hands, electric and cigarette burns.

[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:43.580]
The human rights office says in a new report.

[01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:47.840]
The horrors of the torture chamber that led the Saddam Hussein's Iraq being labeled the Republic of Fear

[01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:51.660]
after the book of that title by Kainan Makia have again become commonplace.

[01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:56.680]
The bodies and bagdads more often there are signs of severe torture, including acid-induced injuries and burns,

[01:55:57.140 --> 01:55:59.340]
caused by chemical substances, missing skin,

[01:55:59.340 --> 01:56:04.780]
broken bones, backhands and legs, missing eyes and wounds caused by power drills or nails.

[01:56:05.500 --> 01:56:07.680]
Those not killed by these abuses are shot in the head.

[01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:10.660]
Human rights groups say tortures practice in pre-Yamhood,

[01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:12.840]
but George will put George Will on that poll, okay?

[01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:13.460]
Okay, right, wingers?

[01:56:13.580 --> 01:56:13.960]
Josh Will.

[01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:14.540]
Yeah.

[01:56:15.060 --> 01:56:19.840]
Human rights groups say tortures practice in prisons run by the US as well as those run by the Interior and Defense Ministries

[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:21.960]
and the numerous Sunni and Shi'ai militias.

[01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:26.260]
The pervasive use of tortures only one aspect of the other breakdown of government across the Mac outside

[01:56:26.260 --> 01:56:29.180]
of the three Kurdish provinces in the North in July and August alone,

[01:56:29.340 --> 01:56:31.140]
in 667 civilians killed, we know that.

[01:56:31.420 --> 01:56:37.600]
One US Army major was quoted as saying that Baghdad is now a Hobzian world where everybody is at war with everybody else,

[01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:39.660]
and the only protection is self-protection.

[01:56:40.040 --> 01:56:41.920]
Iraq is in a state of primal anarchy.

[01:56:42.620 --> 01:56:46.080]
Paradoxically, the final collapse of security in the summer is managed from the outside world because

[01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:49.220]
the country is too dangerous for journalists to report what's happening.

[01:56:49.580 --> 01:56:53.720]
Some 134 journalists mostly Iraqi have been killed since the fall of Sodom in 2003.

[01:56:53.720 --> 01:56:58.660]
They continue rising numbers of civilian skill violently to rack underlines the failure of the new Iraqi government

[01:56:58.660 --> 01:57:02.780]
of Prime Minister Nuri Amaliki installed in May after intense US and British pressure.

[01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:05.840]
The new government shows no signs of being more affected than the old one.

[01:57:06.480 --> 01:57:12.680]
It is just a government of the green zone, said in Iraqi official, referring to the fortified zone and central Baghdad housing the Iraqi government

[01:57:12.680 --> 01:57:14.460]
as well as the US and British embassies.

[01:57:14.860 --> 01:57:21.040]
And an attempt to regain control of the capital and reduced sectarian violence, government and US troops lost operation together forward in mid-July,

[01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:23.800]
but it seems to have had only a marginal impact for a couple of weeks.

[01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:29.560]
The number of civilians killed in July was 3590 and fell to 39 in August but was on the rise again at the end of the month.

[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:35.560]
The bi-monthly UN report in Iraq is almost the only neutral and objective survey of conditions in the country.

[01:57:35.960 --> 01:57:40.880]
The real number of civilians killed in Iraq is probably much higher because outside Baghdad, deaths are not recorded.

[01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:45.920]
The health ministry claims for example that in July nobody died violently in Al-Anbar province in Western Iraq,

[01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:52.360]
traditionally the most violent region, but this probably means the violence was so intense that casualty figures couldn't be collected from the hospitals.

[01:57:52.820 --> 01:57:53.900]
Nobody in Iraq is safe.

[01:57:54.440 --> 01:57:59.080]
Busses and cars are stopped at checkpoints and Sunni or Shia are killed after a glance at their identity cards.

[01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:03.580]
Many people now carry two sets of identity papers, one Shia and one Sunni.

[01:58:03.980 --> 01:58:09.180]
Car number plates showing that it was registered in a Sunni province, maybe enough to get the driver shot in a Shia neighborhood.

[01:58:09.180 --> 01:58:20.180]
Sectorian civil wars pervasive in Baghdad and Central Iraq, religious processions are frequently attacked on 19th and 20th of August as Shia religious pilgrimage came under sustained attack that left 20 dead and 300 wounded.

[01:58:20.740 --> 01:58:26.520]
The Iraqi state and Russia society have been criminalized, gangs of government are often described on state television as wearing police uniforms.

[01:58:27.140 --> 01:58:31.920]
One senior Iraqi minister laughed as he told the independent, of course they wear police uniforms, they're real policemen.

[01:58:31.920 --> 01:58:42.380]
On July 31st for example armed men in police uniforms driving 15 police vehicles kidnapped 26 people in an area of Baghdad known as Erisat that used to be home to several of the capital's better restaurants.

[01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:46.460]
Gunman, dressed in police uniforms had also kidnapped the head of a racial Olympic committee.

[01:58:46.840 --> 01:58:51.160]
On March of our al-Sadi in 12th of Elizabeth's center of Baghdad, grants and demands were made.

[01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:59.260]
US military suspected that Baghdad's police's serious crime squad may have been responsible and stormed its headquarters to search for the family for the kidnapped victims in its basement.

[01:58:59.260 --> 01:59:06.960]
It is long been a matter of amusement and disgust in Iraq that government ministers travel abroad to give press conferences claiming the insurgency is on sliced legs.

[01:59:07.320 --> 01:59:13.940]
One former minister said, I know of ministers who've never been to their ministries but get their officials to bring documents to the green zone where they sign them.

[01:59:14.300 --> 01:59:23.680]
Beyond the green zone Iraq has descended into a murderous anarchy for several days this month the main road between Baghdad and Basar was closed because two families were fighting over ownership of an oil field.

[01:59:23.680 --> 01:59:34.520]
Government ministries are either Shia or Sunni and Baghdad this month the television crew filming the morgue had a cow behind a wall because the Shia guards were fighting a gun battle with the Sunni guards of the electricity ministry nearby.

[01:59:35.180 --> 01:59:38.280]
Then and now, 1990 here's comparisons, 1998.

[01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:45.160]
The Commission of Human Rights noted massively and extremely grave violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law by the government of Iraq.

[01:59:45.580 --> 01:59:51.600]
Hundreds of executions some boys may have been extra-due desial executions, torture and ill-fremend continued to be widespread.

[01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:58.800]
2006 the situation as far as torture is concerned is now completely out of hand many people say that it is worse than in the times of Sodom.

[01:59:59.060 --> 02:00:01.520]
You find bodies with very heavy and serious torture marks.

[02:00:02.120 --> 02:00:11.400]
1998 in July group of six people including one woman were sentenced to death by hanging on charges of organized prostitution involvement in the white slave trade and smuggling booze to Saudi Arabia.

[02:00:11.940 --> 02:00:21.580]
2006 on September 7th Iraqi authorities announced the execution by hanging at Abu Abu Gharr prison of 27 prisoners including one woman convicted of terror and criminal murder.

[02:00:22.120 --> 02:00:24.980]
In the first mass execution since Sodom Hussein's rule.

[02:00:25.760 --> 02:00:28.700]
And it's going to be on forever. Things are going swimming.

[02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:31.680]
They will go on forever because they shouldn't like you said of attack us.

[02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:37.420]
Let's say fast from Ed from D.P.

[02:00:37.620 --> 02:00:39.020]
He belongs on the Ed Naha.

[02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:43.840]
He's your on level would say, Ed Naha says that on my home.

[02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:46.180]
He goes to get but that's right from my website.

[02:00:46.180 --> 02:00:50.040]
He writes great stuff and almost always on smurkingchimp.com.

[02:00:50.160 --> 02:00:50.680]
That's a great website.

[02:00:51.080 --> 02:00:54.340]
The website is a great website. All of these things.

[02:00:55.600 --> 02:00:58.260]
And the nation which we better start adding a lot of those this weekend Josh.

[02:01:02.540 --> 02:01:04.880]
I mean what would be the absolute max?

[02:01:04.980 --> 02:01:05.900]
Stop turning man.

[02:01:06.780 --> 02:01:08.040]
Why can't I ever say any more than 30?

[02:01:08.420 --> 02:01:09.200]
Are you drunk?

[02:01:09.440 --> 02:01:11.320]
I mean do you remember what happened yesterday?

[02:01:11.580 --> 02:01:13.000]
Did you have a bad day in the casino?

[02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:14.700]
I didn't go to the casino.

[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:15.500]
Oh okay.

[02:01:15.940 --> 02:01:18.940]
Are you kidding me?

[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:19.980]
You sent me like 55?

[02:01:20.420 --> 02:01:21.940]
Get out of here.

[02:01:22.480 --> 02:01:23.160]
You're joking right?

[02:01:23.840 --> 02:01:25.260]
I sent him 30 typically.

[02:01:25.480 --> 02:01:29.540]
5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17.

[02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:30.420]
What is a lot?

[02:01:31.320 --> 02:01:36.000]
19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 30.

[02:01:36.020 --> 02:01:36.700]
You could go man.

[02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:39.720]
41.

[02:01:41.080 --> 02:01:42.040]
Wait, wait too many.

[02:01:42.240 --> 02:01:43.360]
But you know what happened don't you?

[02:01:44.040 --> 02:01:44.460]
What happened?

[02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:48.280]
Well no I was basically all done.

[02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:50.960]
You know with my usual 25 or 26 and 23.

[02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:53.780]
And then I came in here last night and I come and dreams had all these

[02:01:53.780 --> 02:01:54.860]
additional other ones on there.

[02:01:55.280 --> 02:01:58.200]
And then I started looking at other places and I found all this really neat stuff.

[02:01:58.480 --> 02:01:59.440]
He just had so happy.

[02:02:01.060 --> 02:02:01.700]
Well I apologize.

[02:02:01.940 --> 02:02:02.520]
Now we're even.

[02:02:03.080 --> 02:02:04.600]
It's for your technical services before.

[02:02:04.860 --> 02:02:05.120]
Okay.

[02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:07.300]
My emotional breakdown over this.

[02:02:08.300 --> 02:02:11.600]
Well ever since I watched Chris Van and his old which is your fault I've never been the same.

[02:02:11.780 --> 02:02:15.880]
The biggest name of the best talent for the business real raw trust.

[02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:18.780]
For radio 560, UAM.

[02:02:20.620 --> 02:02:24.780]
And now everybody knows about all the school.

[02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:27.380]
You should make some serve of it.

[02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:27.840]
School.

[02:02:29.700 --> 02:02:32.060]
Well she made those weird old man.

[02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:35.060]
But with the mean things that she sent.

[02:02:35.060 --> 02:02:39.000]
But with somebody just grab that bitch.

[02:02:39.020 --> 02:02:41.280]
Slam her upside the hell.

[02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:42.720]
Well just school.

[02:02:43.740 --> 02:02:45.620]
What a bit of old school.

[02:02:47.440 --> 02:02:50.260]
I want to hear no more about it.

[02:02:51.040 --> 02:02:54.880]
I just wish somebody would shut her up.

[02:02:56.220 --> 02:02:58.520]
Well if Anne thinks she's so tough.

[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.500]
But why don't we find out?

[02:03:01.500 --> 02:03:07.500]
But put her in a room with Rosie O'Donnell and see which one comes out.

[02:03:07.800 --> 02:03:08.860]
But old school.

[02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:11.740]
But Rosie would.

[02:03:13.900 --> 02:03:16.660]
Let's make Anne sick a little longer.

[02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:22.040]
By giving her an uppercut to the job.

[02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:29.740]
You did.

[02:03:30.220 --> 02:03:31.600]
You brought you more.

[02:03:31.820 --> 02:03:34.080]
It's 103 at 560 WQ AM.

[02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:36.180]
I forgot to tell you this before some good news.

[02:03:36.700 --> 02:03:38.140]
Since you hate Walmart like poison.

[02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:38.660]
Yeah.

[02:03:39.100 --> 02:03:39.980]
And I think you like target.

[02:03:40.260 --> 02:03:40.500]
Yes.

[02:03:40.980 --> 02:03:41.620]
Well here you go.

[02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:43.500]
Walmart's the world's largest retailer.

[02:03:43.500 --> 02:03:47.460]
Plants to slice the prices of almost 300 generic prescription drugs like we told you yesterday.

[02:03:47.680 --> 02:03:49.440]
But you don't have to go to Walmart.

[02:03:50.220 --> 02:03:50.660]
Okay.

[02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:52.540]
Minneapolis based target corporate.

[02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:54.260]
The country's number two discounted behind Walmart.

[02:03:54.540 --> 02:03:58.440]
Said it would match its rival's lower prices in the tenth of the area immediately if not sooner.

[02:03:58.840 --> 02:04:03.040]
A news release last night didn't say a target would also do so as Walmart expands the program.

[02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:05.140]
And the company didn't immediately reach her in a phone call.

[02:04:05.260 --> 02:04:06.680]
She can comment from ABC News.

[02:04:07.100 --> 02:04:09.080]
But the statement said targets long-standing practice.

[02:04:09.460 --> 02:04:11.000]
It's to be price competitive with Walmart.

[02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:14.040]
The drugs will be sold for as low as $4 a month supply.

[02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:17.360]
And include some of the most commonly prescribed medicine such as metformin,

[02:04:17.660 --> 02:04:21.220]
a popular generic drug used to treat diabetes, and the high blood pressure medicine,

[02:04:22.960 --> 02:04:23.280]
Luzinipril.

[02:04:24.340 --> 02:04:24.860]
I like that.

[02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:26.960]
And about 300 drugs.

[02:04:27.400 --> 02:04:28.660]
So you want to get a whole bunch of drugs.

[02:04:28.940 --> 02:04:29.520]
Go to target.

[02:04:29.880 --> 02:04:30.160]
A brand.

[02:04:30.860 --> 02:04:33.180]
I have to go to, I mean you can go to Walmart if you want to.

[02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:33.780]
We would go once.

[02:04:33.980 --> 02:04:34.960]
Please if you did not.

[02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:37.280]
I hate Walmart like poison.

[02:04:37.560 --> 02:04:37.940]
But nevertheless.

[02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:39.440]
So there is the deal.

[02:04:39.560 --> 02:04:41.880]
You can go to target and you don't have to be a co-wrestling to go into Walmart.

[02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:45.020]
As a continuous sending their testicles and their tentacles in the air,

[02:04:45.160 --> 02:04:48.960]
whether it's food, whether it's like gardening stuff, what you name it, man.

[02:04:49.960 --> 02:04:51.620]
Drugs, toilet paper, right?

[02:04:52.060 --> 02:04:52.320]
Oh yeah.

[02:04:53.420 --> 02:04:56.220]
They want, they want to grab you and take every dime you've gotten.

[02:04:56.340 --> 02:04:58.360]
They just take you up and shake you upside down.

[02:04:58.360 --> 02:04:59.000]
I'm not going to casino.

[02:04:59.000 --> 02:04:59.620]
It's the same thing.

[02:05:00.100 --> 02:05:03.240]
Just pick up your ass and shake you upside down till every coin falls out.

[02:05:03.480 --> 02:05:04.160]
Kind of like McGreen.

[02:05:05.440 --> 02:05:08.460]
Here's the fact that it says, for this handwriting, it looks very familiar.

[02:05:08.700 --> 02:05:09.400]
Russell in New York.

[02:05:09.560 --> 02:05:10.520]
Does that hand write with very familiar?

[02:05:10.780 --> 02:05:10.940]
Yes.

[02:05:11.500 --> 02:05:12.980]
Well, you must be a chronic rust.

[02:05:13.840 --> 02:05:15.280]
It says, please put Bill Press.

[02:05:15.500 --> 02:05:15.660]
Ah!

[02:05:16.140 --> 02:05:16.360]
Ah!

[02:05:17.040 --> 02:05:18.840]
I'm going to have a little time to have that attack.

[02:05:19.600 --> 02:05:20.200]
A pedal attack.

[02:05:20.240 --> 02:05:21.240]
A freaking press.

[02:05:21.480 --> 02:05:22.060]
A magnetic attack.

[02:05:22.420 --> 02:05:26.360]
For years, he used intelligence as a good humor to counter all the way when talking heads today.

[02:05:26.620 --> 02:05:31.340]
He hosts a fast-paced morning show on Sirius left and Rift W and ask every day.

[02:05:31.580 --> 02:05:32.380]
I'll take your word for it.

[02:05:32.380 --> 02:05:33.420]
Let's put Bill Press on there.

[02:05:33.800 --> 02:05:36.520]
Because last couple of times I see him on certainly not news network.

[02:05:36.720 --> 02:05:39.420]
He was really, he was kind of like Al Martino.

[02:05:39.420 --> 02:05:40.420]
Very weak.

[02:05:40.540 --> 02:05:41.200]
Very weak.

[02:05:41.580 --> 02:05:42.800]
Oh my God.

[02:05:43.020 --> 02:05:44.100]
I couldn't believe it.

[02:05:44.280 --> 02:05:46.220]
And then Chris Madness, he's over and slaps him in the head.

[02:05:46.260 --> 02:05:47.400]
You cannot block a man!

[02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:48.840]
Put the mask on.

[02:05:50.120 --> 02:05:52.120]
Now he gets very excited when he talks politics.

[02:05:52.400 --> 02:05:56.980]
You know, Chris, a fast-paced morning show on Sirius left and Rift W and ask every day.

[02:05:57.160 --> 02:06:01.240]
Thank you Russell in New York, have a great life and your handwriting is very, very familiar.

[02:06:01.540 --> 02:06:01.700]
Is that?

[02:06:02.440 --> 02:06:02.700]
Oh yeah.

[02:06:02.980 --> 02:06:04.820]
It must be a former chronic faster.

[02:06:05.420 --> 02:06:06.420]
And it came in on a different fact.

[02:06:06.420 --> 02:06:07.460]
Now let me ask you something.

[02:06:07.680 --> 02:06:08.460]
I just had a curiosity.

[02:06:08.660 --> 02:06:11.560]
Has anybody called in since Joshua Courses taking many calls off the year?

[02:06:11.960 --> 02:06:12.480]
Well I stopped.

[02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:13.860]
But stop one.

[02:06:14.180 --> 02:06:15.240]
I stopped doing it.

[02:06:15.420 --> 02:06:16.080]
Why is that?

[02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:20.300]
Because I just wrote down my attorney's phone calls and that was it.

[02:06:21.540 --> 02:06:24.820]
But nobody, what I was going to ask you, nobody called any names for this poll though.

[02:06:25.260 --> 02:06:25.540]
Yeah.

[02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.960]
Well so that proves you are aware you're not taking calls so they're not going to call.

[02:06:29.100 --> 02:06:29.880]
I don't know but you don't understand.

[02:06:30.240 --> 02:06:32.660]
See I think, I think we, I mean better late than never.

[02:06:32.660 --> 02:06:36.820]
But I think many in the day when we had those boring, a poll building for poll buildings,

[02:06:37.020 --> 02:06:38.000]
boring you know, you do know that.

[02:06:38.420 --> 02:06:38.500]
Right.

[02:06:38.920 --> 02:06:40.540]
And all we would get is I got one for the poll.

[02:06:40.660 --> 02:06:41.660]
I would have been much easier.

[02:06:41.700 --> 02:06:43.940]
They could have just called Josh and he would have passed him along thus.

[02:06:44.020 --> 02:06:47.840]
Here's another name for the movie poll or the actor poll or whatever poll we were climbing.

[02:06:48.020 --> 02:06:50.300]
You know, hey do we have the area in the Huffington on there?

[02:06:50.740 --> 02:06:51.540]
No but we ought to.

[02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:52.400]
Why not?

[02:06:52.840 --> 02:06:53.080]
Okay.

[02:06:53.400 --> 02:06:53.700]
From the evening.

[02:06:53.920 --> 02:06:55.740]
So if she's sure got the light, she saw the light.

[02:06:56.400 --> 02:06:57.800]
Now why don't we have Michael Moore on there?

[02:06:57.920 --> 02:06:58.760]
Isn't he a commentator?

[02:06:59.060 --> 02:07:00.520]
He has his columns, he writes periodically.

[02:07:00.960 --> 02:07:01.620]
He's got his own website.

[02:07:01.620 --> 02:07:03.500]
How come that Michael Moore is not there?

[02:07:03.800 --> 02:07:04.140]
Good part.

[02:07:04.800 --> 02:07:07.180]
Yeah, let's get Arianna Huffington and Michael Moore.

[02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:10.780]
We're trying to pacify the right wingers, you know, with Bob Novak and O'Reilly and all these other,

[02:07:11.280 --> 02:07:12.840]
you know, we didn't put Bob Novak.

[02:07:12.900 --> 02:07:14.520]
We'll put his ugly old ass on there too.

[02:07:14.840 --> 02:07:15.880]
He won't be around much longer.

[02:07:16.580 --> 02:07:17.840]
He walks with a steep cane.

[02:07:19.200 --> 02:07:19.820]
439 votes.

[02:07:19.940 --> 02:07:21.260]
And look at all the people that don't have any.

[02:07:21.880 --> 02:07:23.340]
Bill Presswell, he just went on there.

[02:07:23.740 --> 02:07:24.260]
Ed Naha.

[02:07:24.700 --> 02:07:25.060]
Uh huh.

[02:07:25.500 --> 02:07:28.300]
George Will and Claudeur, David Burson, John Nichols.

[02:07:28.560 --> 02:07:29.900]
Well, some of those is probably just as well.

[02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.300]
Bursh taken aback by Musharov Comen.

[02:07:34.180 --> 02:07:36.240]
That he was threatened by the US, you know, likely story.

[02:07:36.760 --> 02:07:41.540]
President Bursh said that he was taken aback by a purported US threat to bomb Pakistan into the stone age

[02:07:41.540 --> 02:07:44.700]
if it didn't cooperate in the fight against terrorism after the non-loven attacks.

[02:07:45.360 --> 02:07:49.800]
He praised Pakistan, he president general, pervert Musharov for being one of the first four on leaders

[02:07:49.800 --> 02:07:53.160]
to come out after an unloven attacks to stand with the US to help rid out the enemy.

[02:07:53.600 --> 02:07:57.520]
And of course to continue selling nuclear technology to every tenth world country you can to make a buck.

[02:07:57.520 --> 02:07:59.600]
For being one of the biggest crooks anyway.

[02:08:00.260 --> 02:08:05.580]
And to join White House news conference, Musharov said a piece treaty between his government and tribes along the Pakistan Afghan border

[02:08:05.580 --> 02:08:07.060]
is not meant to support the Taliban.

[02:08:07.700 --> 02:08:09.080]
Oh, not the Taliban, man, man.

[02:08:09.520 --> 02:08:11.660]
He said news reports and mischaracterized the deals.

[02:08:11.760 --> 02:08:13.160]
The deal is not at all with the Taliban.

[02:08:13.680 --> 02:08:14.920]
This is against the Taliban.

[02:08:15.080 --> 02:08:17.400]
This deal is with tribal elders, Musharov, Bissan.

[02:08:17.780 --> 02:08:18.920]
Bursh said, I believe him.

[02:08:19.540 --> 02:08:25.520]
He said the Musharov had looked him in the eye and found that the tribal deal was intended to reject the televanization of the people

[02:08:25.520 --> 02:08:28.580]
and that there won't be a Taliban and there won't be an Al-Qaeda in Pakistan.

[02:08:29.180 --> 02:08:31.000]
Anybody believe in it? No. No.

[02:08:31.520 --> 02:08:36.520]
In an interview aired on 60 Minutes this Sunday, Musharov said that after terrorists struck the US on 9-11,

[02:08:36.960 --> 02:08:42.520]
then deputy secretary of state armadage told Pakistan's intelligence director the US would bomb his country if he didn't help.

[02:08:42.960 --> 02:08:49.420]
The intelligence director told me that you better be prepared to go back to the stone age, Musharov told 60 Minutes, the stone age.

[02:08:50.040 --> 02:08:52.840]
Armadage told CNN yesterday he never threatened to bomb Pakistan.

[02:08:53.080 --> 02:08:55.500]
Wouldn't say such a thing. It didn't have the authority to say it anyway.

[02:08:55.880 --> 02:09:00.400]
He said he didn't have a tough message for Pakistan telling the Muslim nation it was either with us or against us.

[02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:00.600]
Oh!

[02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:07.820]
And lying through his teeth as usual, good old W. Said, the first I heard of this is when I read in the newspaper,

[02:09:08.400 --> 02:09:11.700]
I was taken aback by the harshness of the words. Right.

[02:09:12.420 --> 02:09:18.560]
The harshness of the words and of course the loudness of the bombs and the intensity of the death and the death of the West.

[02:09:19.320 --> 02:09:19.400]
Right.

[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:20.360]
Wow.

[02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:22.580]
There's more on that doodle stuff.

[02:09:22.900 --> 02:09:24.140]
That was kind of an interesting story to me.

[02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:27.680]
Doodles, presidential doodles.

[02:09:28.040 --> 02:09:31.880]
President Kennedy scribbled Vietnam over and over drawing a box around the word each time.

[02:09:32.540 --> 02:09:36.800]
President Eisenhower sketched a picture of himself looking larger than life bear tested with a head full of hair.

[02:09:38.020 --> 02:09:39.980]
Oh my god, he must have had...

[02:09:40.420 --> 02:09:41.780]
More than I've bargained for.

[02:09:42.080 --> 02:09:45.760]
President Reagan doodles smiling cowboys alongside love notes to his wife.

[02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:46.640]
Little Nancy.

[02:09:47.100 --> 02:09:49.200]
President Carter and Ford left no scribblings.

[02:09:49.700 --> 02:09:51.520]
Well, I should tell you about right there, shouldn't it?

[02:09:52.200 --> 02:09:58.660]
It's not the first thing a scholar might search for in the public record, but presidential doodles hold a certain fascination for the historically minded.

[02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:03.740]
Doodles are often the last remnants of unconscious, unscripted presidential writings said David Greenberg.

[02:10:03.740 --> 02:10:12.080]
By the way, happy new year, David, who I historian who examined two centuries of scribbling by commanders and chief for a book appropriately titled presidential doodles.

[02:10:12.580 --> 02:10:13.980]
See, I thought a book I would get.

[02:10:14.300 --> 02:10:16.320]
I don't mind reading it here on some of these things.

[02:10:16.320 --> 02:10:18.580]
I've seen a couple of presidential poodles maybe.

[02:10:19.200 --> 02:10:26.200]
The book includes the absent-minded scratches of 24 presidents plus a note from President Bush collected from public records and are crimes across the country.

[02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:28.700]
What is that?

[02:10:30.380 --> 02:10:35.440]
Oh, Greenberg cautions against reading too much into a doodle, but he believes they offer glimpses into the president's private side.

[02:10:35.740 --> 02:10:38.820]
So much of what we hear from the president is planned and vetted by focus groups.

[02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:42.080]
It's unspontaneous. These doodles are exactly the opposite.

[02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:43.580]
It's often unconscious.

[02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:45.840]
Like the brainstem, the shoes master.

[02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:48.660]
The doodles do seem telling, take Kennedy, for example.

[02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:52.600]
There's the box in rendering of yetnom, which has an obsessive anxious field of wood.

[02:10:52.600 --> 02:10:59.140]
An immortal producer in a visibly by the shore of a rank Kennedy doodle the words, Iraq, Syria, and Egypt, and put boxes around each word as well.

[02:10:59.800 --> 02:11:03.420]
Greenberg views these sketches as a window in a Kennedy's problem solving process.

[02:11:04.620 --> 02:11:11.640]
In another Kennedy doodle, he would seemingly modern day relevance, I mentioned this the other day, he wrote 9-11 repeatedly, and the word conspiracy next to it.

[02:11:11.880 --> 02:11:14.100]
He also inverted the numbers writing 11-9.

[02:11:14.500 --> 02:11:15.360]
11-9.

[02:11:16.300 --> 02:11:16.740]
Conspiracy.

[02:11:16.740 --> 02:11:20.600]
It turns out that was the telly of a committee vote, not a foreshadowing of 9-11.

[02:11:20.700 --> 02:11:22.840]
I see, if you read a little bit more than you find out.

[02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:24.520]
See, you just get a little bit of view.

[02:11:24.520 --> 02:11:26.900]
You got to like Paul Harvey says, get the rest of the story.

[02:11:27.240 --> 02:11:28.600]
That was the number of a committee vote.

[02:11:29.160 --> 02:11:30.720]
I said nothing to do with 9-11.

[02:11:31.500 --> 02:11:32.040]
See that?

[02:11:32.500 --> 02:11:33.400]
Good morning, American.

[02:11:33.780 --> 02:11:35.060]
Right. Good day.

[02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:39.580]
And it goes on about Eisenhower and all of a sudden, very boring.

[02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:42.460]
President Johnson, oh my god.

[02:11:42.460 --> 02:11:55.820]
Are we going to get to it too about the propaganda that the Republicans are spreading to black Americans, about how the Republicans are the ones who copped up this old rice luncheon slightly, and how the KKK was formed by Democrats, all of this stuff.

[02:11:56.480 --> 02:11:59.820]
You know, this, like, you know, Carrie did say the truth only he kind of whispered.

[02:11:59.960 --> 02:12:01.460]
This, this crowd is the worst.

[02:12:01.720 --> 02:12:03.940]
They are the absolute worst in American history.

[02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:05.120]
There's nobody even close.

[02:12:05.580 --> 02:12:07.180]
It's the mob they took over.

[02:12:07.180 --> 02:12:13.080]
He just doesn't have the balls to open up a big mob and say it because I guess he values his life and, you know, how silly of him.

[02:12:13.480 --> 02:12:14.100]
Just unbelievable.

[02:12:14.960 --> 02:12:16.560]
There's another thing about doodles here.

[02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:18.040]
And I just, I don't know what the hell I did with it.

[02:12:18.060 --> 02:12:19.320]
I had like little blurbs.

[02:12:19.940 --> 02:12:25.560]
One of my candy written on the stationery from the rice hotel, which reads, Houston's welcome to the world.

[02:12:26.040 --> 02:12:27.780]
He drew a sleek sailboat on calm waters.

[02:12:28.160 --> 02:12:31.560]
It looks peaceful and pleasant and he sketches the night before he was assassinated.

[02:12:31.560 --> 02:12:38.060]
When it comes to sheer talent, Thomas Jefferson, a renowned architect, was exceptionally skilled, but his papers contain proper drawings.

[02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:41.620]
The closest thing in the record is that he constantly drew up codes.

[02:12:42.140 --> 02:12:44.200]
He had a bad code and he probably gave it to his maids too.

[02:12:44.620 --> 02:12:45.580]
Remember his black maids?

[02:12:46.020 --> 02:12:46.240]
Oh, really?

[02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:47.460]
Oh, really?

[02:12:47.460 --> 02:12:51.380]
So maybe when we Thomas Jefferson really was the father of our country and our church Washington after all.

[02:12:51.660 --> 02:12:52.000]
What do you think?

[02:12:52.140 --> 02:12:53.400]
The illegitimate father of our country.

[02:12:53.680 --> 02:12:54.180]
That's correct.

[02:12:54.480 --> 02:12:56.640]
Just like our illegitimate president that we got right now.

[02:12:56.820 --> 02:13:00.840]
The biggest name of the best talent in the history of the Unrotten.

[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.320]
It's the 2006 QAM.

[02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:10.000]
It's the 2006 QAM.

[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:11.880]
Mercedes-Benz Grand Flameting Contest.

[02:13:11.960 --> 02:13:18.460]
If a Marlins player hits a grand slam in the fifth inning, you could win a two-year lease of a Mercedes-Benz state to 30.

[02:13:18.780 --> 02:13:22.560]
For more information and to enter, log on to wqam.com today.

[02:13:22.860 --> 02:13:28.420]
The 2006 Mercedes-Benz Grand Flameting Contest from sport radio 5.60.

[02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:29.440]
QAM.

[02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:32.060]
It's Friday, you bastard.

[02:13:32.640 --> 02:13:34.500]
Here she comes.

[02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:37.360]
Going on the air.

[02:13:38.440 --> 02:13:40.760]
She's reading her news now.

[02:13:41.560 --> 02:13:42.880]
Hey, who really cares?

[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:46.080]
Hey, hey, Katie Curret.

[02:13:46.900 --> 02:13:48.680]
The viewers are on the attack.

[02:13:49.960 --> 02:13:51.900]
They're too busy on it.

[02:13:52.680 --> 02:13:54.700]
I want them by the fire.

[02:13:55.860 --> 02:13:57.720]
Hey, hey, Katie Curret.

[02:13:57.720 --> 02:14:00.780]
You're a little too far into me.

[02:14:01.260 --> 02:14:02.420]
CDS, fine, too.

[02:14:02.540 --> 02:14:03.700]
Just fine now.

[02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:06.300]
You're overgrown, tell of me.

[02:14:07.680 --> 02:14:09.280]
Hey, hey, Katie Curret.

[02:14:09.960 --> 02:14:12.060]
You're just an example to me.

[02:14:12.880 --> 02:14:15.080]
Of the main attempt to move some ratings.

[02:14:15.780 --> 02:14:17.300]
Think I'm moving to ABC.

[02:14:19.040 --> 02:14:21.440]
Hey, Katie, your stuff is 1.19 at 5.60.

[02:14:21.580 --> 02:14:24.700]
We need, let's see, we have 1424 votes between the two polls.

[02:14:25.040 --> 02:14:26.320]
76 short of 1,500.

[02:14:26.760 --> 02:14:30.320]
If we got to 1,500 on the first day of Russia's show,

[02:14:30.520 --> 02:14:32.280]
I mean, it starts at sundown, but never less.

[02:14:33.060 --> 02:14:34.620]
It would never be quite a feather in our camp.

[02:14:35.240 --> 02:14:35.840]
In our skull camp?

[02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:36.440]
Yes, it would be.

[02:14:36.780 --> 02:14:37.000]
Wow.

[02:14:37.240 --> 02:14:38.900]
I'm actually George, we're even going to go into the show.

[02:14:39.160 --> 02:14:41.060]
I really thought, I wouldn't even do it.

[02:14:41.100 --> 02:14:41.940]
We're all the headgear.

[02:14:42.180 --> 02:14:42.820]
I can't see that.

[02:14:42.980 --> 02:14:43.540]
That's just one religion.

[02:14:43.920 --> 02:14:45.520]
We got 4.69 on the current poll.

[02:14:45.660 --> 02:14:49.220]
But what we need to do with it, we got 40 minutes to get 76 votes.

[02:14:49.400 --> 02:14:50.220]
That's 2.00 minutes.

[02:14:50.660 --> 02:14:51.160]
More or less.

[02:14:51.660 --> 02:14:51.760]
Right?

[02:14:52.100 --> 02:14:52.240]
Right.

[02:14:52.240 --> 02:14:53.780]
Like I said, we just got 2 more.

[02:14:54.840 --> 02:14:55.740]
1426, the poorian.

[02:14:56.020 --> 02:14:58.320]
And when we will do a play-by-play, each one comes in not.

[02:14:59.140 --> 02:15:01.680]
Robert Ray Heisenga, son of Miami-Balphins owner,

[02:15:01.860 --> 02:15:04.440]
Wayne Heisenga, could be sentenced up to 6 years in prison today

[02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:07.460]
for a 2003 drug-driving incident in Fort Lauderdale.

[02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:10.020]
Last month, the younger Heisenga pleaded no contest

[02:15:10.020 --> 02:15:11.560]
to a felony DUI charge.

[02:15:12.060 --> 02:15:14.800]
And a misdemeanor court account of refusing to submit to a blood.

[02:15:15.120 --> 02:15:16.260]
You know what this reminds me of?

[02:15:16.620 --> 02:15:19.020]
I was thinking about this the other day I got sidetracked by myself,

[02:15:19.020 --> 02:15:19.860]
which I often do.

[02:15:20.260 --> 02:15:21.940]
It's the other reason I don't need any calls,

[02:15:21.940 --> 02:15:23.300]
because I can just argue with myself.

[02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:27.980]
But remember I was in limbo there after Paxton paid me off to go away

[02:15:27.980 --> 02:15:30.160]
and you were doing your flunky stuff for the station, right?

[02:15:30.800 --> 02:15:33.160]
And I remember going to a hockey game one night, the old Miami Arena.

[02:15:34.500 --> 02:15:38.480]
And this was after this was after Greg Reed deposed one of his stunts

[02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:40.240]
and made promises that he didn't fullfill.

[02:15:40.380 --> 02:15:43.360]
And I was starting to get the feel of what this place was all about,

[02:15:43.580 --> 02:15:44.360]
the beesleaves and Greg.

[02:15:44.820 --> 02:15:46.220]
And it was like some really sour feeling.

[02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:49.140]
And I remember Mike, what was his name?

[02:15:49.140 --> 02:15:50.880]
Chris Moore, not Michael Moore.

[02:15:51.020 --> 02:15:55.280]
Chris Moore, the oldest, first Panther's radio broadcaster, Will DB.

[02:15:56.220 --> 02:15:58.880]
And he's up there with the Dees Pothan, Dumb Frog, the F.

[02:15:59.800 --> 02:16:02.360]
And he's going on about, you know, Wayne Heisinger,

[02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:05.080]
they got the Dolphins on that station and he owns the, at that time,

[02:16:05.200 --> 02:16:07.120]
I think, the Neonah Marlins also, at that time.

[02:16:07.380 --> 02:16:08.060]
I think he's going to.

[02:16:08.220 --> 02:16:08.360]
Yeah.

[02:16:08.920 --> 02:16:11.060]
And I don't think the enlarge is ever going to be on it.

[02:16:11.160 --> 02:16:13.020]
It's that already sent a contract, but Chris Moore,

[02:16:13.160 --> 02:16:15.520]
I'm running around breathlessly, announcing to everybody.

[02:16:15.860 --> 02:16:17.600]
In fact, I think he said it on the air one morning.

[02:16:17.940 --> 02:16:18.180]
He did.

[02:16:18.180 --> 02:16:19.580]
Yeah, he said it on the air.

[02:16:19.860 --> 02:16:22.100]
I don't think the enlarge is will ever be on this radio station.

[02:16:22.400 --> 02:16:24.240]
Well, here we are almost, huh?

[02:16:24.540 --> 02:16:25.020]
I don't, I agree.

[02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:25.960]
I don't think he will be either.

[02:16:26.200 --> 02:16:28.380]
Oh, here we are almost nine years later.

[02:16:28.580 --> 02:16:31.900]
I'm still on here going strong, kicking some big fat nasty gross ass.

[02:16:32.100 --> 02:16:32.960]
And where's Christine?

[02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:36.320]
And more where she vanished to somewhere in one of the 85 different

[02:16:36.320 --> 02:16:37.400]
to beyond the VSPN.

[02:16:37.760 --> 02:16:38.040]
No doubt.

[02:16:38.360 --> 02:16:42.400]
If that, I just thought I'd mention it because it was so stupid when he made that comment.

[02:16:42.680 --> 02:16:44.580]
I don't think you're like, wait, I'll never put up with this guy.

[02:16:44.660 --> 02:16:45.040]
Well, you know what?

[02:16:45.320 --> 02:16:46.720]
Let's see, do we have the dolphins anymore?

[02:16:46.720 --> 02:16:47.820]
We lose money on any more.

[02:16:47.900 --> 02:16:48.020]
No.

[02:16:48.100 --> 02:16:49.380]
Is way known to Marlins anymore.

[02:16:49.460 --> 02:16:49.600]
No.

[02:16:50.060 --> 02:16:51.740]
Does he own the panties that we have anymore?

[02:16:51.840 --> 02:16:51.980]
No.

[02:16:52.520 --> 02:16:53.720]
So what do we got to do with Wayne?

[02:16:54.920 --> 02:16:55.560]
Absolutely nothing.

[02:16:55.860 --> 02:16:56.180]
Absolutely.

[02:16:56.440 --> 02:16:56.840]
Am I correct?

[02:16:57.300 --> 02:16:58.040]
You are correct.

[02:16:58.520 --> 02:17:01.860]
I mean, even though we have to suck up the dolphins a little bit because we have the real pregame,

[02:17:02.020 --> 02:17:05.220]
show in the real postgame, show you know, we want to pretend that we're, you know,

[02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:06.500]
real tight-led dolphins.

[02:17:06.820 --> 02:17:06.820]

[02:17:07.220 --> 02:17:07.460]
Right.

[02:17:07.880 --> 02:17:08.640]
Of course, we don't.

[02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:09.180]
We aren't.

[02:17:09.380 --> 02:17:10.240]
And we know that they suck.

[02:17:10.520 --> 02:17:13.560]
And that they're lucky to sell that their third game is against the little girls teams

[02:17:13.560 --> 02:17:14.980]
and that their 11 point favorites.

[02:17:15.520 --> 02:17:18.680]
And otherwise they've had a, if they were playing like any real team this weekend, they'd be

[02:17:18.680 --> 02:17:19.120]
one three.

[02:17:19.400 --> 02:17:20.340]
I'll say that right now.

[02:17:20.760 --> 02:17:22.400]
Of course, I know they're not playing any other teams.

[02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:24.520]
So it's very easy for me to make that kind of a statement, right?

[02:17:24.980 --> 02:17:25.200]
Right.

[02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:26.020]
Josh agrees.

[02:17:26.220 --> 02:17:28.720]
If they were playing like a real good team this weekend, they'd be on three.

[02:17:28.880 --> 02:17:31.360]
And listen, I wouldn't count out the fact that they could be on three.

[02:17:31.760 --> 02:17:36.520]
You mean, even against, uh, yeah, I wouldn't, I don't think it's that they're going to lose.

[02:17:36.620 --> 02:17:36.920]
Titans?

[02:17:37.320 --> 02:17:38.180]
I wouldn't count it out.

[02:17:38.480 --> 02:17:38.660]
Yeah.

[02:17:38.660 --> 02:17:40.440]
Well, you thought Buffalo would beat him too.

[02:17:40.620 --> 02:17:43.020]
You thought, uh, Buffalo, I mean, you thought they could be Buffalo.

[02:17:43.520 --> 02:17:43.800]
I did.

[02:17:44.280 --> 02:17:46.380]
Buffalo everybody was saying Buffalo would be a weak sister.

[02:17:46.860 --> 02:17:47.620]
Yes, what's sister?

[02:17:48.120 --> 02:17:52.220]
In December 2003, Robert Ray Heisen, who was 44, was driving on Las Vegas Boulevard.

[02:17:52.520 --> 02:17:54.680]
When he struck a 71 year old man, who was crossing the road.

[02:17:55.040 --> 02:17:58.000]
The man, amazingly, was not seriously injured, but spent the night in the hospital.

[02:17:58.420 --> 02:17:59.180]
Heisen is the UI.

[02:17:59.320 --> 02:18:02.640]
Rest his third and 10 years becomes an automatic felony.

[02:18:03.360 --> 02:18:05.560]
Is it, you know, this is, this is just by luck.

[02:18:05.560 --> 02:18:10.120]
I'm not going to profess any psychic powers here, but it's 23 past one.

[02:18:10.240 --> 02:18:12.020]
You know what time is hearing you set for this afternoon?

[02:18:12.520 --> 02:18:12.880]
123.

[02:18:13.640 --> 02:18:14.000]
130.

[02:18:14.300 --> 02:18:14.680]
Oh, okay.

[02:18:15.200 --> 02:18:19.280]
At the Robert County Courthouse, Sir Kid Judge Michael Kaplan will decide to either descend

[02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:22.780]
into prison or give a lesser punishment for making him rubbed at his ball spot for five years.

[02:18:23.140 --> 02:18:24.200]
Is that incredible or what?

[02:18:24.260 --> 02:18:25.480]
Or make him go to a dolphin game?

[02:18:25.760 --> 02:18:26.800]
Well, they'll teach him.

[02:18:27.640 --> 02:18:31.520]
And if you go to that stadium, he's some of that crappy food that Josh was forced to eat.

[02:18:31.780 --> 02:18:33.420]
And they even took the car veil out of there, didn't they?

[02:18:33.840 --> 02:18:34.600]
Yes, they did.

[02:18:35.280 --> 02:18:35.600]
Bastards.

[02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:36.540]
You know, what am I saying?

[02:18:36.600 --> 02:18:37.240]
I love that.

[02:18:37.340 --> 02:18:39.240]
That was about the only thing I enjoyed there was the car veil.

[02:18:39.520 --> 02:18:41.480]
Hot Fudge Sunday, we were like a lot of extra cherries on it.

[02:18:41.720 --> 02:18:41.900]
Yes.

[02:18:42.080 --> 02:18:42.900]
Did you like cookie puss?

[02:18:44.060 --> 02:18:44.860]
What the hell was that?

[02:18:45.360 --> 02:18:46.460]
The Carvelle Cake?

[02:18:47.060 --> 02:18:48.400]
No, get out of here with that.

[02:18:48.860 --> 02:18:49.780]
Hot Fudge Sunday, man.

[02:18:49.820 --> 02:18:50.640]
I'm chocolate ice cream.

[02:18:50.640 --> 02:18:52.040]
We're like lots of extra cherries.

[02:18:52.380 --> 02:18:52.560]
Mmm.

[02:18:53.120 --> 02:18:53.820]
Boy, those were good.

[02:18:54.180 --> 02:18:55.100]
And what did they put in there?

[02:18:55.220 --> 02:18:56.260]
Why do I want to go into that?

[02:18:58.880 --> 02:18:59.200]
Wow.

[02:18:59.760 --> 02:19:02.560]
All I can talk about is what I missed there because I liked it.

[02:19:02.560 --> 02:19:06.400]
And Fabrice used to bring those sandwiches before they gave me those fat-filled sandwiches from that

[02:19:06.400 --> 02:19:07.340]
sub shop in Kindle.

[02:19:07.800 --> 02:19:09.800]
And we would talk about a fat cookie puss, man.

[02:19:09.800 --> 02:19:13.800]
We said that before the game just chow and down to have it a great time before some of those

[02:19:14.280 --> 02:19:15.520]
chronics used to start coming over.

[02:19:15.860 --> 02:19:17.000]
And I never forget it.

[02:19:17.140 --> 02:19:21.420]
As long as I live, you remember the two sisters at the bookstore from Detroit.

[02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:22.180]
Oh, yeah.

[02:19:22.440 --> 02:19:23.260]
The tool bags.

[02:19:23.460 --> 02:19:26.980]
And we spent like half of the time we were there with them, entertaining them and shooting them.

[02:19:27.260 --> 02:19:27.260]

[02:19:27.260 --> 02:19:29.620]
And then they were all bent out of shape that we didn't spend out of time with them.

[02:19:30.020 --> 02:19:30.180]
Right.

[02:19:30.180 --> 02:19:32.140]
And I got a fax or letter from them or something.

[02:19:32.900 --> 02:19:34.460]
Boy, you didn't dance with them.

[02:19:34.880 --> 02:19:35.040]
Yeah.

[02:19:35.220 --> 02:19:35.580]
No kissing.

[02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:37.900]
Didn't do a kazaski and give them like a little tongue.

[02:19:38.360 --> 02:19:40.580]
But the best of all, though, even better than that was the guy.

[02:19:41.120 --> 02:19:41.940]
And I didn't remember him.

[02:19:42.160 --> 02:19:45.900]
Some guy, some young guy and his wife came, you know, rich and arson.

[02:19:46.040 --> 02:19:50.240]
They're in, mighting your own business before the game in our seats in those days used to pay for my own seats.

[02:19:50.740 --> 02:19:53.000]
Enjoying a meal, watching the practice before the game.

[02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:55.180]
And this guy comes by and brings his wife.

[02:19:55.300 --> 02:20:00.020]
And as always, I'm always very, you know, like not not like on a kissy kissy with everybody.

[02:20:00.020 --> 02:20:01.440]
But hi, how you doing?

[02:20:01.540 --> 02:20:05.320]
Nice to meet you and I'm friendly and pretending I was happy to see them even though I'm trying to eat.

[02:20:05.820 --> 02:20:09.220]
And then he called me, called one day, or sent me a fax about how,

[02:20:09.620 --> 02:20:13.520]
while I brought my wife by how you did with soup there like some kind of a bump on the log.

[02:20:14.180 --> 02:20:16.140]
Like I was posting it up and you had dance for them.

[02:20:18.080 --> 02:20:18.440]
Yeah.

[02:20:18.900 --> 02:20:20.760]
You had dance like Tucker Wilson.

[02:20:21.200 --> 02:20:22.440]
Get one of those canes.

[02:20:22.880 --> 02:20:23.880]
Just draw hats.

[02:20:24.080 --> 02:20:24.260]
Yeah.

[02:20:24.480 --> 02:20:25.960]
And that sure wasn't even on the air back then.

[02:20:27.440 --> 02:20:28.020]
What a jackass.

[02:20:28.960 --> 02:20:31.100]
Like I owe him some kind of entertainment.

[02:20:31.420 --> 02:20:33.540]
And it's not a radio show when I'm out there in a ballgame.

[02:20:33.600 --> 02:20:34.920]
Okay, what did I hate then?

[02:20:35.040 --> 02:20:38.580]
I just, then the guys that were coming knock your beer over or whatever.

[02:20:38.720 --> 02:20:39.580]
And just idiots.

[02:20:40.200 --> 02:20:42.760]
That's one of the reasons it's so much better to stay home and watch it on TV.

[02:20:43.420 --> 02:20:45.700]
Just like here, you don't think I go to the hockey games do you?

[02:20:46.240 --> 02:20:46.640]
I don't know.

[02:20:47.040 --> 02:20:48.220]
Not good, it's not that far.

[02:20:48.660 --> 02:20:49.880]
I could hop right on the subway.

[02:20:50.240 --> 02:20:52.500]
And the subway takes you right into the air Canada center.

[02:20:52.900 --> 02:20:54.880]
But who now wants to go there and deal in it?

[02:20:55.040 --> 02:20:58.080]
It's not like me believe gardens where people used to be a little more gentle and gentle.

[02:20:58.080 --> 02:21:01.020]
And like when once the appearance started everybody had their ass in there.

[02:21:01.060 --> 02:21:01.940]
See not anymore.

[02:21:02.280 --> 02:21:05.640]
And so they walk in front of you and they got their spill in your beer and food on you.

[02:21:05.700 --> 02:21:07.080]
Like, you can't even see the damn game.

[02:21:07.300 --> 02:21:08.860]
I don't want to be around people like that.

[02:21:09.200 --> 02:21:13.680]
I want to sit in front of my beautiful big HB TV, watch the games in HB which they all are.

[02:21:13.960 --> 02:21:16.460]
And enjoy it and listen to Joe Bowen and enjoy it.

[02:21:16.540 --> 02:21:16.880]
That's all.

[02:21:17.240 --> 02:21:21.520]
Now how would the fight in these slabs, these drunken slabs and these snobby,

[02:21:21.640 --> 02:21:23.040]
and slabs and snubs?

[02:21:23.180 --> 02:21:23.720]
That's what you got.

[02:21:23.820 --> 02:21:24.100]
There you go.

[02:21:24.440 --> 02:21:25.040]
Yeah, that's it really.

[02:21:25.040 --> 02:21:27.480]
Those are the people I call the slabs and snubs.

[02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:32.700]
The people in the platinum seats where they are $300 a ticket or whatever the hell it is.

[02:21:32.820 --> 02:21:34.260]
It may be at the air Canada center.

[02:21:34.660 --> 02:21:38.000]
And when the period starts it's like five minutes before you see those idiots back in their seats again.

[02:21:38.200 --> 02:21:41.440]
Because the two busy schmoozing in the club section under the stand will screw them.

[02:21:42.060 --> 02:21:43.420]
I'll watch that on my TV for free.

[02:21:43.520 --> 02:21:43.960]
Thank you.

[02:21:44.460 --> 02:21:48.680]

The biggest name, so best talent, this is Neil Rogers for 20560-UAM.

[02:23:05.260 --> 02:23:07.340]
Getting stoned in South Florida.

[02:23:07.340 --> 02:23:12.340]
Oh right!

[02:24:07.340 --> 02:24:08.520]
Let's go to South Florida!

[02:24:42.500 --> 02:24:46.000]
Well, they're supposed to be some words here, but I forgot because I'm supposed to be working fine.

[02:24:46.480 --> 02:24:49.880]
I would have lost the losing everybody out there was smoking fine.

[02:24:50.260 --> 02:24:54.460]
Fine, I saw the supply and mail in the red actually better than the real again.

[02:24:55.140 --> 02:24:55.620]
Oh!

[02:24:56.320 --> 02:24:56.780]
Let's go to South Florida!

[02:24:57.860 --> 02:24:59.080]
Let's go to South Florida!

[02:24:59.980 --> 02:25:01.460]
Let's go to South Florida!

[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:06.460]
Let's go to South Florida!

You're fairly!

[02:25:18.220 --> 02:25:20.380]
134-26 before Mad Dog time and two.

[02:25:20.540 --> 02:25:23.100]
I don't think we're gonna make our 1500 between the two poles, that's bad.

[02:25:23.840 --> 02:25:26.580]
503 on S1, 955 and S14-58.

[02:25:26.720 --> 02:25:28.800]
We need 42 votes in 26 minutes.

[02:25:28.800 --> 02:25:31.680]
Well, that's not even too a minute, but I don't think we're gonna get it.

[02:25:32.020 --> 02:25:35.060]
Unless we really put the pedal on your metal.

[02:25:35.240 --> 02:25:40.580]
I don't understand this fact to you because I just Googled it and I got it in my hand right now in the facts too.

[02:25:41.180 --> 02:26:10.540]
It says, oh my god, quick, quick, I just Googled how we're David and clicked on the Wikipedia definition and it says, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[02:26:10.540 --> 02:26:40.400]
David was also a CBS's radio lead, Play by Playboyce for sending a football coverage to 95 when CBS moved him out of a football both replacing him with a long time voice, a wait a minute. See, my mind is chopped off. You read it to me. When CBS what? I don't know where you left off. We moved him into the Monday night football both replacing a long time voice jack buck into. Here's the part you need to read. Yeah. He left them after the 2004 season because he was intimidated by infamous talk show host Neil Rogers, hilarious parodies of him taking

[02:26:40.400 --> 02:27:10.200]
free pizza. Oh, for me. Get out of here. That's what it says. No, it does not. Yeah, it does. It doesn't. Not a mind. Not a mind. It doesn't. It just says he left them after the 2004 season period. So I must begin a different Wikipedia man. I think I found very interesting two things in 2006 David provided hand by hand coverage for many events that the world series of poker for serious satellite radio, which is mildly amusing. And then at the end, I see every day where you see that. It says currently, David is what?

[02:27:10.200 --> 02:27:26.200]
Out of sports USA Jones radios NFL voices right. Okay. Yeah. Okay. And then it says in 2006 at the very end. Right. Now that I go to the last sentence of the paragraph before that. But it's not on mine. Don't you want to say it says he left them after the 2004 season period. The rest of it's not on there. Oh.

[02:27:26.580 --> 02:27:33.920]
And then the categories for you to click on it says you're a birth missing. That's the part that I don't know. Some other music. So anyway.

[02:27:34.440 --> 02:27:41.140]
Well, so I have only one of our cranks to put that on here. You know, just like they put on there about your agenda and your thing on your thing.

[02:27:41.520 --> 02:27:54.240]
Well, though on my on my page and Wikipedia, where it says at the end about, you know, when he's not there, whatever that said, what did it say? You were pond risk and the coma and do sing and whatever. No. And still had much higher numbers than the sports segments on the radio station each and every summer.

[02:27:54.240 --> 02:28:02.000]
Including this one. So we have a trend when Monday at 10 30. I think all right. Something to look forward to, baby, because that's going to be two

[02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:09.840]
turds of the summer book. Wow. Heavy, heavy duty, man. You can almost smell it from here. Two thirds. And of course, across the street, they're going to be.

[02:28:10.140 --> 02:28:19.080]
It's a good thing it's a Jewish holidays because Joel Fiber is going to be sitting shivvy, baby. They're going to have to go to show a lot and pray for a number of Monday. It's not coming. 523. Okay.

[02:28:19.260 --> 02:28:25.680]
I think we got a shot. Now see when he boosted them a little bit. Josh said, you're not boosting. Sorry. I think I think that's going to have to give you better instruction.

[02:28:25.680 --> 02:28:30.060]
Next week, maybe we have to give him better instruction. We're not losing more of my accounts to busy ducking.

[02:28:31.840 --> 02:28:38.160]
Let's see. Oh, I see. Oh, there it is. See, on mine, see what you'll be as you know, this is the thing that's disturbing me about that.

[02:28:38.380 --> 02:28:44.520]
Although no, in a way, it's good because people can put entries on there that for people who get looked over like me, we didn't have anything on

[02:28:44.520 --> 02:28:51.020]
here for me. And we get some of these other marginal human beings on there. It's pretty embarrassing. He left physicians, both physicians,

[02:28:51.020 --> 02:28:59.040]
after Super World 38 to 36 to take a position with a dolphins. He left them at the act of the 2004 season because he was

[02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:07.520]
intimidated by infamous talk show host Neil Rogers, hilarious parodies of him taking free pizza. You're right. It was most amusing.

[02:29:07.780 --> 02:29:12.800]
And even though you're right, it's more amusing when you see it. You know, let's run in front of your post. The pizza and somebody

[02:29:12.800 --> 02:29:24.380]
grants it on your hand. I'm used to post a play. Oh, for me. That's it. You never did send that to me, brother. What the all for me? Yeah, you have that. I know I don't.

[02:29:24.380 --> 02:29:34.040]
Under what? That's all that's all I just clip that from that ID that 12 to 1 hour or one to two hour, whichever one, one, two, three, four, five,

[02:29:34.040 --> 02:29:39.840]
Oh, I just stopped it and dubbed it from there. How can I have him play that in a long time?

[02:29:39.940 --> 02:29:43.140]
Talk about it in my old cameras. Is it the 12 to 1 hour? That is the one.

[02:29:43.560 --> 02:29:49.520]
More out of the day. Yes. And this portion of the Neil Rogers and the 12 to 1 hour is brought to you by the

[02:29:49.520 --> 02:30:00.040]
Let it 12. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 11, 12, 7, 8, so like this of pizza. Oh, I can do that.

[02:30:00.860 --> 02:30:08.820]
Oh, and I real, real cleanly, but I can do it. Yeah, let's stop with the most. I was most amusing. I like it. 21 till 2 at you. I'm not going to read that.

[02:30:08.980 --> 02:30:15.860]
Most start now. Do the break first. Black Republican groups and accuses Democrats are starting to KKK and claims Martin Luther King was a Republican.

[02:30:15.860 --> 02:30:22.280]
Which we say. Oh my gosh. The biggest name. The best talents to the business. Neil Rogers.

所有说清嘛 Because of this wonderful album, my program ended up giving a punch this afternoon.

[02:33:01.160 --> 02:33:06.360]
下次小小别见阿姨 vlogs video, 我们和亚洲人超爱这个的时候的that kids get naked before freely talk about or get along with their twins while dancing in that or not.

rights legislation from the 1860 to the 1960s and were responsible for starting the Ku Klux

[02:33:24.080 --> 02:33:30.180]
Klan. Isn't that lovely? The National Black Republican Association, the NBRA. Although

[02:33:30.180 --> 02:33:32.940]
it doesn't mention any candidates, he has been here to support the Senate Governor

[02:33:32.940 --> 02:33:37.680]
Michael Steele, as he runs against 10-term congressman Benjamin Carden for the first open

[02:33:37.680 --> 02:33:42.420]
Maryland seat in two decades. Last year, Democratic Senator Paul Sarvey's announced he wouldn't

[02:33:42.420 --> 02:33:47.520]
be seeking relations to a sixth term. The 60-second added shape is a casual conversation between

[02:33:47.520 --> 02:33:50.940]
two African-American women who want to explain to the other how Democrats had banned

[02:33:50.940 --> 02:33:54.460]
boozled blacks into believing that their parties are more for the civil rights movement than

[02:33:54.460 --> 02:33:58.240]
the Republican Party. The character named Tina claims that Democrats passed those black

[02:33:58.240 --> 02:34:02.800]
codes and Jim Crow laws starting the Ku Klux Klan and released those vicious dogs and

[02:34:02.800 --> 02:34:06.440]
fire hoses on black people. According to the Tina character, Democrats have talked

[02:34:06.440 --> 02:34:10.600]
to talk that Republicans have walked the walk. Girl, it's time for us to do the walk to

[02:34:10.600 --> 02:34:14.300]
women's seat together. Then you know it, girl. The National Black Republican Association

[02:34:14.300 --> 02:34:20.120]
believes that their edgy ad paid for by the black Republican Freedom Fund, a 527 organization,

[02:34:20.500 --> 02:34:23.880]
will open the eyes of black Americans by sitting in the records straight, even though civil

[02:34:23.880 --> 02:34:28.400]
rights historians obviously challenge their claims. They should be screaming about this

[02:34:28.400 --> 02:34:32.100]
story. There should be Democrats on air on every talk and head network and even on

[02:34:32.100 --> 02:34:36.520]
the comedy channel screaming. It sets the record straight demonstrating that was Republicans

[02:34:36.520 --> 02:34:41.000]
not Democrats who championed civil rights for blacks over the past 150 years. NBRA Chairman

[02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:45.980]
Francis Rice said in the press release, I didn't know LBJ was a Republican. Democrats

[02:34:45.980 --> 02:34:49.360]
have hijacked the civil rights record of the Republican Party and fought every effort

[02:34:49.360 --> 02:34:53.820]
of Republicans to help blacks get off the Democrat Party's economic plantation. Although

[02:34:53.820 --> 02:34:57.260]
the tentacabitor still told the Washington Post only yesterday, before he heard the ad

[02:34:57.260 --> 02:35:00.780]
that it was about time Republicans speak to their real place in history and to debunk the

[02:35:00.780 --> 02:35:05.160]
myths, his campaign released a statement earlier today asking the group to pull it. Pull

[02:35:05.160 --> 02:35:10.140]
it. Pull on it? Hard. And nothing's happening. NBRA's current radio ad is insulting the

[02:35:10.140 --> 02:35:13.820]
Marylanders and should come down immediately to steal campaign statement. Although they

[02:35:13.820 --> 02:35:17.280]
may have had good intentions, there's no room for this kind of slashing, verdant partisan

[02:35:17.280 --> 02:35:21.260]
politics. And the important conversation about out of best bring meaningful change to

[02:35:21.260 --> 02:35:25.800]
Washington DC and get something done in Maryland. Oh, brother. The Washington Post spoke to

[02:35:25.800 --> 02:35:30.000]
a University of Maryland political scientist who slammed the ads distortions. It's totally

[02:35:30.840 --> 02:35:34.380]
police's rendition of the platform of the parties because it affected what has happened.

[02:35:34.640 --> 02:35:39.440]
The two parties essentially switched to ideology. Ronald Waters told the post. The AP also

[02:35:39.440 --> 02:35:43.980]
notes the NBRA describes itself on its website as a resource for the black community on Republican

[02:35:43.980 --> 02:35:48.200]
ideals. Doesn't say how many members they've got. Last year was reported that half of the

[02:35:48.200 --> 02:35:51.800]
newly formed groups board of directors have resigned. At the same time, the Bush administration

[02:35:51.800 --> 02:35:57.160]
was taking heed for the federal response after Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans. The organization

[02:35:57.160 --> 02:36:01.100]
and its current leadership is heading down a much different direction than was envisioned

[02:36:01.100 --> 02:36:04.580]
by myself and the other board members said former communication director Christopher

[02:36:04.580 --> 02:36:10.020]
Aps in an email yesterday Manhattan journalist Steve Gilear wrote a post on his news blog

[02:36:10.020 --> 02:36:14.260]
which contained a point-by-point response to each line in the radio ad. In reaction to

[02:36:14.260 --> 02:36:17.900]
the claim that Democrats want us to accept the same sex marriages, Tina Borsen without

[02:36:17.900 --> 02:36:21.820]
appearance consent and suing the Boy Scots were saying God in their pledge Gilear fired

[02:36:21.820 --> 02:36:25.800]
back. Most black people care more about jobs and are acting gaze getting married. He told

[02:36:25.800 --> 02:36:30.300]
Ross story that the ad was especially offensive because it assumes that blacks are unsophisticated

[02:36:30.300 --> 02:36:34.040]
voters who are driven by emotion when Maryland just may have the highest concentration of blacks

[02:36:34.040 --> 02:36:39.060]
with advanced degrees anywhere on the planet. So try and rewrite histories in solving. He

[02:36:39.060 --> 02:36:43.960]
said people know the history of the two parties and this is just offensive. How do you like

[02:36:43.960 --> 02:36:48.460]
that? Democratic strategy is Joe Tripley told the Washington Post the statement was almost

[02:36:48.460 --> 02:36:52.620]
as bad as what the website did to try to sphere an entire party with one random person

[02:36:52.620 --> 02:36:57.260]
through up on the web. How do you like that? And the candidate Michael Steele knows that

[02:36:57.260 --> 02:37:01.680]
the radio ad is a time bomb that he's going to pay for. Well just let him pay for it.

[02:37:01.680 --> 02:37:06.840]
I hope it explodes right in his ass. You know what year it is? What year is it? You're

[02:37:06.840 --> 02:37:12.380]
the current 5766 maybe. Oh how did you wish? New year is right is a looking back grimly

[02:37:12.380 --> 02:37:15.920]
on the passing year and with a lesbian he's wore still fresh in their minds. See a little

[02:37:15.920 --> 02:37:19.340]
hope that the coming year will vote any better. According to Jewish tradition Russia's

[02:37:19.340 --> 02:37:23.120]
show or New Year which begins at sundown tonight offers a chance to turn over a new leaf

[02:37:23.120 --> 02:37:27.560]
of fig leaf and part of the passing months. Now go back to that pull about the Jews being

[02:37:27.560 --> 02:37:31.260]
very popular in America is appointed in terms of what religious groups are admired, etc.

[02:37:31.260 --> 02:37:35.420]
And atheists being one of the least next to science colleges. How about somebody born

[02:37:35.420 --> 02:37:39.440]
a Jew who likes Delhi? I guess they split the difference. Can I get off the hook on that?

[02:37:40.200 --> 02:37:44.220]
Somebody born a Jew who can hate for like Delhi a lot. Lexes, blinces and is Kishki.

[02:37:44.680 --> 02:37:50.600]
5.63 now what is that? Oh that put us over the edge. That put us over the top. We got 15 million.

[02:37:50.980 --> 02:37:56.840]
We got over a thousand. I mean over 1500 all together. Now exciting. Really? The passing year

[02:37:57.740 --> 02:38:03.040]
5766 in the creation of the world of Krona Jewish tradition took Israel through some of the

[02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:06.480]
most dramatic moments of its recent history. It began with his wheels withdraw from the

[02:38:06.480 --> 02:38:10.440]
gods after 38 years of occupation. So the disappearance of Edmund leader Ariel Shiroun who

[02:38:10.440 --> 02:38:14.480]
still off tourists and the election of the radical Islamist Hamas moving in the Palestinian

[02:38:14.480 --> 02:38:18.740]
territories. And now the year and shortly after the lesbianies war which many consider

[02:38:18.740 --> 02:38:23.440]
a failure both politically and militarily. No kidding. No Schmidt. How are those cluster

[02:38:23.440 --> 02:38:28.520]
bombs you want by the way? Yes. You might say that that war that invasion at Bush prompted

[02:38:28.520 --> 02:38:34.120]
was a bomb. The year 5767s beginning with Israelis disappointed in their government angry

[02:38:34.120 --> 02:38:38.040]
over the mistakes of the lesbianies war and deeply pessimistic about any breakthroughs in

[02:38:38.040 --> 02:38:41.960]
the Al-Badmourabund Middle East process. In other words the Jews still hate the Arabs

[02:38:41.960 --> 02:38:46.580]
and the Arabs hitting like poison back. I like that. I mean you know like they said

[02:38:46.580 --> 02:38:51.620]
to Godfather they had us so we hit them back. We hit Bruno Tataria 3 o'clock this morning.

[02:38:51.620 --> 02:38:58.200]
Remember that? I do. 563 votes. Who is your favorite communist or a commentator? Keith

[02:38:58.200 --> 02:39:03.460]
Obroman 204 man he kicked ass. Nice going Keith. 8 to 9 p.m. on MSNBC every Monday through

[02:39:03.460 --> 02:39:09.120]
Friday countdown. Don't have one 90 more in doubt 88 68 or he just he just dominates.

[02:39:09.260 --> 02:39:14.840]
That good? I don't know why 24 from six people. Hate this tool 23 Mali Evans 20 duck tops

[02:39:14.840 --> 02:39:19.360]
in 19. He's great. Lou Dobbs 18. You're great. Come back again like Chris Matthews would say

[02:39:19.360 --> 02:39:25.700]
if he was talking politics. Great to last 16. Rush Limbaugh 16. Paul Krogan 13. Frank Rich

[02:39:25.700 --> 02:39:32.880]
a dozen. Michael Morton. Al Franken had six. I like that. In everybody else fairly small potatoes.

[02:39:52.660 --> 02:39:56.680]
You. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm here.

[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:06.580]
What did you hear about the Muslims and what they've done?

[02:40:07.540 --> 02:40:14.380]
They said fire to some churches. They shot and killed and done. I'm tired of a hand.

[02:40:14.380 --> 02:40:19.660]
They say they're not really violent. They say they're not really mean.

[02:40:20.860 --> 02:40:29.300]
All the Muslims are mad at them. Then it's 16. Then it did 16.

[02:40:30.780 --> 02:40:39.400]
What did he say? They make those Muslims so angry and act that way.

[02:40:40.320 --> 02:40:45.700]
Maybe it's because he's from Germany.

[02:40:46.340 --> 02:40:49.420]
That's what it is. He ties his shoes a little nice.

[02:40:50.680 --> 02:40:56.240]
Then it's 16. Now they're protesting in judgment.

[02:40:57.080 --> 02:41:05.600]
They're all so many things. It's a proper no harm. They say the folks be fain.

[02:41:06.680 --> 02:41:12.320]
All over the place. They're burning up with cheese.

[02:41:13.040 --> 02:41:18.060]
Here. All the Muslims are mad at them. Then it exists.

[02:41:18.980 --> 02:41:25.020]
All the Muslims are mad at all. Then it exists.

[02:41:25.020 --> 02:41:28.420]
Bye.

[02:41:31.960 --> 02:41:31.980]
Bye.
