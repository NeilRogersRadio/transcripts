[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960]
It's Friday, you were still...

[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.500]
Coming soon to a cinnamon ear you!

[00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.240]
It's the greatest romantic comedy in the history of film!

[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.640]
Hugh Grant is a fumbling twit!

[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.640]
Well, if I may, I hope I'm not being too forward.

[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.680]
That is to say...

[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.500]
The London Times says a fumbling twit is so lifelike

[00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.180]
that no more film should ever be made!

[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.300]
As they would only fail in comparison to this brilliant piece of twit-headed tightcasting.

[00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.120]
If I may be so bold as to ask you and...

[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.760]
I understand that I'm tying up traffic by standing here in the middle of the street

[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.980]
but I'm very much like to ask you.

[00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.340]
If you see only one Hugh Grant movie this year,

[00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.260]
then you certainly won't need to see this one

[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.420]
because he's playing the exact same twit-y plays in all his movies!

[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.640]
I'm glad that you agreed to have dinner with me and...

[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.180]
Well, there's something I've been meaning to...

[00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.380]
Well, that is to say...

[00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.380]
It finds you to be quite fetching and...

[00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.460]
You think Elizabeth Hurley left him because of that whole divine brown deal?

[00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:52.100]
No!

[00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.540]
She left him because Hugh Grant is a fumbling twit!

[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.960]
Now playing in selected cities!

[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.740]
I do rather hope you'll come to see me in a fumbling twit!

[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.640]
That is to say, if you don't mind my being somewhat cheeky...

[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.360]
Oh, for the love of God with you, shot!

[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.880]
Oh, well, alright then, I suppose...

[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.960]
Yeah, I'll tell you what he is and the one word annoying is what he is.

[00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.700]
Does he have any talent?

[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.940]
No.

[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.600]
Does he look good?

[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.820]
No.

[00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.280]
Look at that, we've got 500 votes on the poll today, man.

[00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.520]
Our goal is 501.

[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.300]
We don't want to set our goals too high on the day.

[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.680]
If you're Thanksgiving on Black Friday when everybody's out shopping.

[00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.220]
We're just playing oldies today.

[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.020]
We're playing the rack.

[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.820]
All the way we have some issues to take here first.

[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.380]
We've got Larry Coakers going to be fired in less than an hour.

[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.520]
What are you laughing about?

[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.520]
You don't know that.

[00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:37.880]
How much you want about it?

[00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.940]
You think because they finally want a game and they may get an invite to the toilet bowl

[00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.120]
that he's going to keep his job?

[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.220]
Six and six.

[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.520]
See, this is what I don't understand about college football.

[00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.600]
They lost six freaking games and they're eligible for a bowl game?

[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.740]
What the hell is that all about?

[00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.040]
They suck!

[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.700]
But nevertheless, how about those dolphins, baby?

[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.800]
Just what I knew it.

[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.780]
I predicted it and just as predictable as the days long, man.

[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.280]
Oh, yeah, they're going to run the table and they're not going to play against any team

[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.680]
that really looks insurmountable.

[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.620]
Let me ask you this.

[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.200]
What team would be insurmountable?

[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.040]
Unbeatable.

[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.120]
What team would that be?

[00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.520]
Because they're saying it's not the Colts.

[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.520]
Then who that would it be?

[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.420]
Well, maybe if the Colts were still undefeated.

[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.340]
No, but I'm just saying what team in the league right now?

[00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.360]
Could they not beat?

[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.740]
Under any circumstances, it's unbeatable by anybody.

[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.540]
There isn't any.

[00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:30.580]
Am I right?

[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.500]
That's correct.

[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.780]
But they got to be Jacksonville and the Patriots, which there's no chance of that.

[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:35.160]
None.

[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.960]
And the Colts, which there's no chance of that.

[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.820]
And then at Buffalo, which Buffalo isn't very good, but they got to play at Buffalo.

[00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.600]
But hey, we got four in a row, baby.

[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.940]
We're talking super bowl.

[00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.600]
That's right.

[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.480]
Could be a good fan.

[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.460]
You know, root for your team and live in a dream world.

[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.220]
But nevertheless.

[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.660]
So on Wednesday, we had the ratings come out.

[00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.320]
The trends and wow, wow, wow, that morning show.

[00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.160]
They just kind of took a crapshoot with that and like let's put some down there and hope

[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.340]
that it flies, you know, hopes them fly stick to it.

[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.900]
And evidently, it is a nice number there in the morning in October.

[00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.500]
And Barry Jackass has got a glowing article about Kimba Bo camper and about our morning

[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.640]
show and we'll get to that.

[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.160]
I'm not going to read stuff other than that.

[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:15.980]
Well, maybe a couple of other things.

[00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.920]
I just can't stop.

[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.540]
Like Mo would say, I can't stop.

[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.340]
Is that what he would say?

[00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.960]
That's what he says.

[00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.700]
No.

[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.500]
How come you're such a schmuck, Mo?

[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.080]
Well, I just can't stop.

[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.480]
How come you're such a a-hole?

[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.680]
Well, the answer is.

[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.340]
I can't stop.

[00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.640]
Yeah.

[00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.260]
Anyway, so speaking of people who get fired, University Miami president Donna Schalele,

[00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.960]
that guy, high level UM officials and board of trustee members are holding a meeting

[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.640]
right now as we speak.

[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.980]
To discuss Larry Coker's future, which likely it says according to the hero, does already

[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:47.460]
decided.

[00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.600]
It's widely expected that Coker will be fired this morning, although he wasn't at the

[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.820]
meeting.

[00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.020]
The final decisions being made by Mr. Schalele at the 11 a.m. news conference, which

[00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.280]
usually served for Coker to give his day after the game comments.

[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.900]
It's expected instead to serve as the announcement of his dismissal.

[00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.660]
It's believed the job of U.M. athletic director Paul D will also come out of discussion.

[00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.520]
What do you like that?

[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.720]
And I would, how far it be for me to agree with anything that Eddie Pope has ever written

[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.600]
because he's an old toad.

[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.240]
But I would agree with what he wrote in the hero today about you have to get a shrink

[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.900]
to want to have that job anyway.

[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.160]
Or I mean, this is a program where if you lose one game, they get all bent out of shape

[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.960]
and you're on the, I mean, lose six games.

[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.800]
Forget about it.

[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.960]
Go away old man.

[00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.820]
Larry Coker has done.

[00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.220]
He's so we got to be still over there at UM, of course, which basically he camps out

[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.020]
there all the time anyway.

[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.820]
That's where he sleeps.

[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.500]
Another overgrown child.

[00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.000]
And so he's going to call Miguel a little of an o'clock and pass along the news, whatever

[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.120]
they, whatever they know.

[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.900]
Although we could carry the press conference, but I guess we're not.

[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.620]
Why not?

[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:49.520]
If you want to.

[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.960]
Well, we have the ability to do that.

[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.220]
We get the ability to do everything.

[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.800]
Well, I don't know if we do or not.

[00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.560]
I don't want to put that crap on the air.

[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.140]
Are you crazy?

[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.540]
Do you when said Wednesday the 3709 Iraqi civilians were killed in October the highest monthly

[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.440]
toll since the Iraq attack by the USA 3709.

[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.100]
Wow, they're dying like flies.

[00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:10.060]
Anybody care?

[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.320]
No.

[00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.640]
No.

[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.160]
And of course, it's black Friday.

[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.360]
I, this is something I never been able to understand as long as I've lived.

[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.000]
It's been going on forever and it gets worse every year.

[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.420]
What, what is this all about?

[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.360]
Everything has a hell of a discount.

[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.800]
Is that what it's all about?

[00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.260]
Yeah.

[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.100]
Everything is 50 to 75% off.

[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.380]
Thousands of South Americans kicked off an annual right of the holiday shopping season.

[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.280]
Black Friday this morning from a best buy and plantation boy tried to get out of that

[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.380]
parking lot and make a left turn.

[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.180]
To a Walmart and what?

[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:42.600]
To a wall.

[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.100]
There should be a light there, but it's going to take about five people getting killed

[00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.660]
there trying to make that left term before they finally put a traffic light in there.

[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:49.400]
You idiots.

[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.220]
I'm telling you I live right there for cloud.

[00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.420]
During these three days of year when I'm there from a best buy and plantation to a Walmart

[00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.660]
and West Kendall determined consumers got in line.

[00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.640]
Some as early as the night before Thanksgiving.

[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.660]
To ensure they get exactly what they came for.

[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.960]
The night before Thanksgiving.

[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.600]
And kindled more than a thousand shoppers lined up outside Target and Walmart before dawn

[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.160]
this morning.

[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.280]
Many anxious load up on electronics.

[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.260]
At a Walmart and West Kendall line snaked around the store across the length of the huge

[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.340]
parking lot all the way to McDonald's on Kindle Drive.

[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.880]
The store opened a few minutes before five this morning and the store manager came outside

[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.340]
and asked shoppers to be courteous.

[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:29.280]
Yeah, right.

[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.580]
This is in South Florida, no less.

[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:32.260]
Be courteous.

[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.820]
With the help of local police shoppers and streamed into the store in an orderly fashion

[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.400]
making a beeline for play stations and Nintendo's.

[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:46.020]
Kendall resident, I have an astrada 32 got what he came for a 52 inch flat screen TV.

[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.500]
From $894 to $474.

[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.620]
It's good to make that line set astrada beaming a few minutes after five a.m.

[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.680]
as he waited for a friend to help load the massive TV into his truck.

[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.520]
He said it was worth a nine hour wait to be the first one to get to this.

[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.280]
Oh, well, you folks have a good time.

[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.380]
Okay, better you than me.

[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.500]
That's all I can tell you on black Friday.

[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.700]
It's the day after Thanksgiving and it's they're just hop it up the dough all over the place.

[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.280]
How's that pull result coming from whatever we run last on Wednesday?

[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.420]
700 seven votes is all we got and of course that's because you know what it was because of.

[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:31.600]
It was Thanksgiving when you use the inward was the poll question never 199.

[00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:32.540]
You believe that?

[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:33.260]
No.

[00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:38.940]
I don't believe there's anybody who never uses that word, but it's politically correct to say,

[00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.260]
I would never say that.

[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.460]
That's the most offensive word.

[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.260]
Okay, 199.

[00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:48.320]
If dark folks say it themselves, then it's okay, but if a whitey said it's really bad.

[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.500]
You're a racist and a big and a piece of crap and should die in hell.

[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.780]
Only in the right company for the occasional joke, but I'm not a racist 139.

[00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:03.860]
When I see OG on TV 101, sometimes in traffic 86, sometimes in the shower when singing to myself,

[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.680]
Bokobrins classic kiss a good morning, 65.

[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.460]
Sometimes I'm watching the news 50.

[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:17.800]
I hate this pull 48 6.7% and when referring to my close personal friends on black 19,

[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.880]
see it's okay for them to say it.

[00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:25.280]
Okay, for you black folks to say the inward, but if a white person says it, that's bad.

[00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:29.600]
Like I can say, faggot, you know, but if like a straight person says it, that's a real schmere, you know.

[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:30.520]
That's a knock.

[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:36.040]
And today's poll, well I can't wait till we start diving into these bits,

[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.340]
because the bits and the hits are just going to keep on coming.

[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.380]
See, I used to work on Thanksgiving Day being the schmuck that I am.

[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:43.940]
I'm an idiot.

[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.080]
I have no idea why.

[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:50.800]
But yesterday we had to delve from pre-game into post-game into real pre- and post-game and pre-op.

[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.360]
And after a very shaky start, they beat the crap out of a little girls team, man.

[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.460]
I couldn't win a fixed game.

[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:03.280]
And Joey Harrington, baby, goes back to the scene of the slime and gets booed and they all carry it on.

[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.340]
And Nick Sabin says that's unacceptable to a dry, right.

[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:07.380]
They hate him. He sucks.

[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.720]
What's your take on the callers as our poll today?

[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.480]
You didn't think I would do this, did you?

[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.100]
I thought you would.

[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.440]
You did?

[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.920]
Oh, I better reach over and turn that monitor off.

[00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:20.160]
We're sure not taking any calls today.

[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.820]
What's your take on the callers, which I think may be coming back on Monday.

[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.700]
And of course I'm going to leave this poll up all weekend.

[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.380]
Because, you know, it's still Thanksgiving, it's still a holiday weekend.

[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:29.900]
Correct.

[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:34.920]
So if we want to get a really scientific sampling, we got to leave it on there long enough to get 8 million votes.

[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:36.560]
What's your take on the callers?

[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.480]
A few calls would be okay, 224.

[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:43.380]
If you don't get carried away, bring the calls back 162 with an exclamation point.

[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.660]
Bring them back, you jackass.

[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:49.280]
The show is fine without the calls. Only 73, 13.7%.

[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.140]
The caller is suck, 69. That's what I voted for.

[00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:53.300]
That's 13%.

[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.500]
And I hate this poll. Only four.

[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.480]
That's 0.7%.

[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.100]
That's like a number they had across the street in this last trend.

[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.240]
0.7.

[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.420]
By the way, heck of a job, Joel.

[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:04.180]
You're doing it, baby.

[00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:08.100]
Joel Feinberg and the crew over there in the Stu Gotts, all those guys across the street.

[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.020]
You're doing a heck of a job.

[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.780]
And of course, on this show, we don't really care.

[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.440]
Wait a minute. I got to get that very jackass column going.

[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.880]
Well, we know 161 people died in the back yesterday.

[00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:19.980]
I'm not going to do all that stuff.

[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:27.260]
Former Dolphin Volcamper, making Mark on TV and Radio, is what the headliners and I'll get to that story momentarily.

[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.300]
Very jackass, Nerald.

[00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:29.260]
Thanks a lot, Barry.

[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:29.880]
Hey, Barry.

[00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:30.480]
You're fair.

[00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.860]
Obviously he's been talking to Kimba and Joe Bell and this one and that one and Yadi Yadi.

[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.840]
Finally decided to give us a little bit of press at a boy, Barry.

[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.840]
And basically, the article, the thrust of it is that Kim now has developed a personality.

[00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:47.100]
Kim, who used to be his dull as a 10-year-old razor blade, a real dullard.

[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.120]
But he laughed at about you.

[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:49.640]
You know it's true.

[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:55.120]
Now all of a sudden, he's like a dull as the only about a two-year-old razor blade.

[00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:57.680]
Good guy, though, but dull.

[00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:59.960]
1013 at 560 WQM.

[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.020]
It's that twa Friday, you bastards.

[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.640]
Yes, do you have a match?

[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.220]
I need to light my shoelace.

[00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:19.080]
When there's a bomb in my shoe and the melody in my heart,

[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:24.040]
I get that cheeky, tink of it healing when I glow the flame

[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:30.380]
A part you show the world at my feet brings me closer to a laugh.

[00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:36.080]
Your lightness worth the taking for my religious of reason why

[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:41.740]
With a bomb on my feet, I'll do the wetspot on your seat.

[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.900]
But I'll do fine that I'm an out-kind of

[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:52.640]
When there's a bomb in my shoe, a la la la la

[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:57.480]
What a wonderful way to die this way

[00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:06.320]
No, I'm fighting you, I'm fighting you, this is a la la la

[00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:09.780]
I want the highest chance

[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.940]
1018 at 560 WQM.

[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:12.280]
Look at that.

[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.360]
The mad dogs working today.

[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.020]
That's what it says in my schedule is he actually on today or not.

[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.200]
Sure.

[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:17.700]
We don't know.

[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.980]
We don't know because parents doesn't give us the real schedule anymore.

[00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.500]
We're like stepchildren.

[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.440]
Mad dog at Hooters and Pompano says in my schedule

[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.940]
End the power hour with Hank and the mad dog.

[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:29.540]
Wait, they're all white.

[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:30.000]
Anyways.

[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:30.600]
What?

[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:31.240]
It's pine.

[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.200]
Is he looking mad dog or Curtis, but it's pines.

[00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.980]
It says Hooters and Pompano on my schedule.

[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.200]
Yeah, well, what are you reading that for?

[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.320]
Then the power hour four to five, Hank solo five to seven, I believe.

[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:42.780]
I'm just reading the schedule that I've got.

[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.520]
Okay, that's all I can do because they don't send me the real revised one

[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.280]
Like when mad dog was not early in the week.

[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.580]
Pants are previewed with seven.

[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:53.120]
The Pants are really stinkin' the joint out against the Washington Senators.

[00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.440]
Oh, all right.

[00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.060]
That's what it says in my schedule.

[00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:02.720]
There's the Washington Crapidels, but the Washington Senators at seven thirty.

[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:04.980]
Followed by the Eddie Kaplan show.

[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.860]
I'm telling you, man, clearance needs a, he needs a lobotomy.

[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.640]
Somebody needs to squeeze his bag, his sack.

[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.400]
There's something wrong with that child.

[00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:16.360]
Says right here, the Florida Panthers against the Washington Senators.

[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:17.460]
Oh, brother.

[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:17.960]
That's funny.

[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:18.760]
Woo!

[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:23.600]
Oh, speaking of bomb in my shoe, just one more little piece of bad news from Iraq.

[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.380]
Then we'll move on.

[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.620]
Okay, I'm gonna read that very jackass comment.

[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.140]
Then we're gonna dive into our whole library here and play stuff.

[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:30.720]
Even that we're not supposed to play.

[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:31.380]
Oh, right.

[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:32.140]
Not.

[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.060]
Oh, in other words, you think I should play all this stuff?

[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.640]
And then I'll leave it up to you to dump all of it.

[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:39.860]
Like, uh...

[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.480]
My ain't it's...

[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:41.820]
Like that.

[00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:43.040]
But anyway.

[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:46.080]
Two bombs killed twenty-two people in northern Iraq today

[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:50.080]
as the government tried to tamp down on violence and hit off a civil war.

[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:50.660]
Oh, yeah.

[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.960]
A day after SUNY Urban Surgeons killed 215 people in an attack on Baghdad,

[00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:58.580]
Saudi city slum, then intensified Shi'id anger at the US.

[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:00.840]
And it goes on.

[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.700]
But it beeps bit of boop, but about every single day they're dying like flies.

[00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.720]
We've created a total mass chaos there.

[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.280]
See, some people are barbaric and full of hate.

[00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.020]
And as a result, they need a good dictator.

[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:11.140]
Like, keep everybody in line.

[00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:12.280]
Like, who the good old saw them?

[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:15.740]
547 votes on the poll.

[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:16.840]
What's the reasonable goal today?

[00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:17.320]
750?

[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:18.460]
The Remus Show?

[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:19.560]
800.

[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:20.780]
No chance.

[00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:21.800]
You're dreaming.

[00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:23.460]
On the day after on Black Friday?

[00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:24.860]
800 My Ass.

[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.900]
Don't forget, 11 o'clock we're going to be getting that call from the beast.

[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:29.760]
At least Miguel will be.

[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.060]
I'm not going to put him on the air.

[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:31.800]
No.

[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:35.300]
Because still probably have tears running down his fat face.

[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.040]
Oh, G. Larry Coker.

[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:37.980]
I've got fire.

[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:39.180]
Oh, the Kings.

[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:40.660]
Grow up already.

[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:41.980]
When do you people going to grow up?

[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:43.100]
God.

[00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:49.260]
From the microseontal J. Rokit School of being a professional, professional, perpetual, U.M. child.

[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:55.020]
Anyway, Barry Jackass in a hero says, former Dolphin Boatcamp are making mark on TV and radio.

[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.740]
Everywhere you turn, there's a former dolphin on the air rights, Barry.

[00:14:59.040 --> 00:14:59.400]
Hey, Barry.

[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.180]
You fairy.

[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:04.020]
Jim Manditz and Joe Rose rank among the market's most popular personalities.

[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:08.880]
Jimmy Cifalus says the prestigious Dolphins radio play by play gig and boy does he do it poorly or what?

[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:16.060]
But no West Dolphins profile has risen more than this year than WQA and WFWR personality using the word very loosely.

[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:16.960]
Kim Bocamper.

[00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:21.980]
The eight years ago was perfectly content spending his post-football life selling municipal bonds.

[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:28.980]
As he completes his third month alongside Dolphin public and restaurant answer, Kenny Walker, on WQM's revamped morning show,

[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.520]
which thank God got a number in the last trend in October.

[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:32.240]
They're kicking ass.

[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.440]
Bocamper has proved what friends already knew about him.

[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:42.820]
He has an underrated sense of humor, a dry wood apparently rarely apparent in some of his early TV and radio work when he was as dull as a 40-year-old razor blade.

[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.380]
This is an opportunity to show people who I really am other than what they may have perceived me to be, he said.

[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.540]
In other words, a dull.

[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:57.140]
In some ways, WQM's morning show is still a work in progress as it tries to find the right balance between sports and non-sports topics.

[00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:00.740]
And Miguel says when they're not talking about sports, it's a real hysterical funny show.

[00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.260]
I don't ever hear those segments, though.

[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:03.820]
It's just bad luck on my part.

[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:13.240]
But Bocamper has been an asset, providing recent commentary and displaying much more of a personality than he did earlier in his career when he was as dull as 75-year-old's blood blue blade.

[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:22.580]
Kim has exceeded my expectations WGM of General Manager, Silly S. Joe Bell said he's better in the combo situation than he's in now than he was by himself.

[00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:27.740]
We're real pleased with the start they're off to, especially at that point, nine in September.

[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:28.760]
They were real pleased about that.

[00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.620]
Well, I'm sure it's his last trend he's talking about.

[00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:31.280]
Do you think?

[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.880]
Well, I can't measure them on that.

[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.820]
Bocamper 52 is extremely self-analytical.

[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:41.960]
I wish I could tell you how many hours I spend during that day thinking what I'm going to say, what I did say, what I didn't say that I should have said.

[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.260]
On TV and radio, I don't see anything casually says Kimba.

[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.640]
On WQM, there are days it's great.

[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:51.200]
I drive away thinking we did a good show.

[00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:53.420]
We said the other days I drive away saying, what am I doing?

[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.580]
What was I thinking about? That show is stuck. We're no good.

[00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:56.740]
People must hate us.

[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.920]
And the next day you do a show and you feel good about it.

[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.220]
Well, what does that happen?

[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:14.340]
Bocamper also runs a production company that produces FASN's Micah Sikki Sports Wrap, was Adolphin's linebacker and defensive lineman from 7785, and broke into broadcasting in 89 when Mandage recommended him for a part-time gig on WIOD.

[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:15.440]
I remember those days.

[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:22.080]
He joined Channel 4 as Adolphin commentator in 1998, and that was asked a year later to become reported back up anchor.

[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:29.220]
Interest rates were down to about 3%. I said, maybe it's time to give TV a try. He said, leaving the bond business.

[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:33.400]
They gave me one of Jim Berry scripts and said, go read this and I bet you budgeted it pretty good.

[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:38.960]
Bocamper said the WQM morning show wants to give people something a little lighter than what they've been accustomed to.

[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:46.320]
Rose's competing show on 790 The Ticket, which has a business partnership with the Harold, isn't exclusively sports-oriented either, right, Spirry?

[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:54.820]
But because the Walker's background is an FM morning host combined with WQM's new approach to the show, the program tells it a way to tame news more often than Rose's does.

[00:17:55.820 --> 00:18:02.220]
But here's the, here's the kicker, baby. This next sentence man does enough to make me drop a big load right in this chair if I didn't have to clean it up.

[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.060]
Oh boy!

[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.940]
Very you are such a little silly person with your little brown sack and baloney sandwich.

[00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:22.940]
He says, at the same time though, WQM wisely has spiced the sports conversation by adding regular segments without spoken Lamar Thomas and Terrell Buckley, 70 a.m. on Mondays, Drew Rosenhoff, 6th Thura, 8th 30 a.m. Wednesdays, and Kirk Krip Street, 90 a.m. Thursdays.

[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:29.460]
Wisely has spiced a ride. That stuff that balance between all sports and like 1% entertainment.

[00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:40.020]
Rose, meanwhile, has Dan Marina with 80 a.m. on Mondays and Ronnie Brown at 8th Tuesdays. That's downtown Ronnie Brown with a bad hand who's always good for a third of a yard and a cloud of dust.

[00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:41.660]
At least a third of a yard.

[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:54.880]
Between 7 and 10 a.m. Rose led narrowly in the latest ratings book in the key man demographic 2554, 2.6 to 2.3, but QF's new morning team was in place for only one of the three months that were measured next rating book of me were telling.

[00:18:54.880 --> 00:19:03.800]
And the last trend by the way, which buries oblivious about already they kicked their ass. Nice going boys Kenny and the bow whose dull is a 75 year old chick razor.

[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:12.560]
Then very goes on with more QM information boy we're sure QM intensive today very nice going baby we need all the publicity we can get even if it's bad we don't care.

[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:24.180]
WQM's lawsuit against former dolphins running back Troy Stratford allegedly moved to 790 without fulfilling a six month non-compute clause has been settled out of court according to Stratford's attorney Ken Caso.

[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:32.300]
Terms were confidential about Caso said Stratford will be permitted to continue selling ads and appearing on air for the ticket WQM to climb comment.

[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:38.840]
But what are we going to say about what's left to say? Yeah. What we're going to say about him.

[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:45.960]
Good guy like Troy. I mean the fact that he went over there and trying to stab us in the heart. That's okay. We understand that's business. Everybody's got to make a living.

[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:53.160]
They say in China. Moths the 11. Everybody's got to make a living. Am I right? That's correct. So we didn't begrudge him anymore than we begrudge fat boy.

[00:19:53.160 --> 00:20:03.420]
In fact we're glad to be rid of fat boy Troy. We like to have him around. He was kind of like a well both of them actually like human punching bags just one little bit bigger than the other about five times.

[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:12.660]
556 votes on the poll. Wow. What's your take on the callers? A few would be okay 238. Bring the callers back 169 for Christ's sakes.

[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:24.680]
The show is fine without the calls only 75 13.4% not good. The callers suck 70 and I hate this poll only for out of almost 600 votes only for 0.7%.

[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:33.980]
I remember they can really associate with and relate to across the street 0.7. In fact in that two to four slot for while they were starting to get pretty damn close.

[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:40.000]
The biggest name right? That's talent. This is me or one. The pinball is part of the video 5.6.

[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:47.000]
Why are you bastard? All right.

[00:20:50.660 --> 00:21:00.080]
Looking through the bars at the county jail. Oh, she was there. He began to well. She got in it. She was there because he drank too much.

[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:03.800]
The title was looking for some to touch it. Oh, she.

[00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:19.100]
Everybody was rather there. So getting ready for the jail. This fact was it was so well.

[00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:29.420]
The same day his marriage was a living hell. He got in the corner with his burrito. He sent the talk about his way to go at all of jobs.

[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:40.520]
Looking all the jailhouse jobs. Everybody was grabbing their socks. Smile and have the jailhouse jobs.

[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:53.340]
And you will the jailhouse jobs. Watching them bust up right. Look at them stiff and they're jobs. Everyone checking their socks.

[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:59.720]
Everybody has had hard nights including those jailhouse jobs.

[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:23.800]
I want to be a Latino. I want to be a Latino and say hey my no and we're not on my head now. I want to wear slick 50 in my hair and dark sunglasses to cover my face.

[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:36.200]
I want to drive in a big car with leopard skin interior with loud and fake. I want a girl named Juanita. I want a girl named Juanita with long black hair.

[00:22:36.200 --> 00:23:06.180]

hair. And I want a girl named Juanita with long black hair. I want a girl named Juanita with long black hair. I want a girl named Juanita with long black hair.

[00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:44.700]
He tried to steal away, who was and beat the OUC!

[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.420]
He tried to steal away, who was and beat the OUC!

[00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:46.480]
He tried to steal away, who was and beat the OUC!

[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.120]
He tried to steal away, who was and beat the OUC!

[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:51.560]
He tried to steal away, who was and beat the OUC!

[00:24:52.480 --> 00:25:01.980]
He tried to steal away, who was and beat the OUC!

[00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:07.140]
And he opened a window,jug him a Même, dtosh устройicular!

[00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:09.020]
Kays is going to play!

[00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:13.060]
Saddam Hussein!

[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.040]
Claudia Varou on her way!

[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.920]
Saddam Hussein!

[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:37.520]
You take us Monday.

[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:44.740]
If I parted in heaven,

[00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:51.880]
You'd I stand the shame.

[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:58.920]
If I parted in heaven,

[00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:07.040]
You'd I stand the shame.

[00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:20.680]
You'd I stand the shame.

[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:20.740]
You'd I stand the shame.

[00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:21.840]
You'd I stand the shame.

[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:36.240]
You'd I stand the shame.

[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:36.740]
You'd I stand the shame.

[00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:39.540]
Does gas act the same?

[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:46.200]
Does it linger in heaven?

[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:53.280]
Would you be ashamed?

[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:59.640]
To pull my finger heaven?

[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:02.020]
Absolutely.

[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:07.720]
I know these things.

[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:13.620]
When the fat lady sings

[00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:20.000]
Because I'll be the one who brings

[00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:24.480]
You're fair and dear to heaven.

[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:33.680]
Because I know I'll be the one who brings

[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.460]
You're fair and dear to heaven.

[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:47.160]
Did you ever think when you're in Chinese?

[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:50.480]
It ain't pork or chicken but a fat sign means

[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:53.280]
Yet the food tastes great so you don't complain.

[00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:56.780]
But that's not chicken in your chicken town, mate.

[00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:59.660]
Seems to me I ordered sweet and sour pork

[00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:02.300]
But garfields on my form.

[00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:05.500]
It's firm here on my form.

[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:10.680]
There's a cat in the kettle at the Peking Moon.

[00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.820]
The place that I eat every day at noon.

[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:17.000]
They could be to cat and you'll never know.

[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:20.260]
Once they wrap it up in no voice.

[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:22.760]
They fried real crisp in dough.

[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:31.100]
Chao Lin asked if I wanted more.

[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:34.380]
I see was dialing up his buddy at the old pet store.

[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:36.760]
I said not today I lost my appetite.

[00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:40.600]
There's two cats in my belly and they want to fight.

[00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:43.660]
I was sucking on a rolling and the thumbs are two.

[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.280]
When I swear I heard it mute.

[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:49.600]
And that is when I knew.

[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:54.700]
There's a cat in the kettle at the Peking Moon.

[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.960]
I think I got to stop feeding there at noon.

[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.980]
They say that it's beef or fish or pork.

[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:03.680]
But it's permed there on my pork.

[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.860]
There's a hair ball on my pork.

[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:17.260]
Hello this is Albert Kaita from Tauli Van Record.

[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:38.140]
I'm a fan of the music.

[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:38.200]

[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:38.200]

[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:38.200]

[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:38.200]

[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:38.520]
I'm a fan of the music.

[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.040]
I'm a fan of the music.

[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:47.240]
I'm a fan of the music.

[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:50.740]
I'm in followed by an F-16.

[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:53.340]
What do they want with me?

[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:56.060]
The money from your purchase does not go to fun terrorism.

[00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:56.580]
Really?

[00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:59.720]
It's not time to get off the plane.

[00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:03.460]
Just relax and take it easy.

[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:05.520]
You're just dumb.

[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.140]
That's your fault.

[00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:10.660]
It wouldn't have been a fire or a joke.

[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:14.740]
Find dark skin and a rag.

[00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:18.600]
If you want a detainee.

[00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:20.080]
Another variation on a classic.

[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:26.720]
I ask myself every day which American should pay.

[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:31.680]
Tell me who would move on and slay me.

[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:32.540]
I'm going to shoot you, everyone.

[00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:35.160]
I'm coming to the neck of a woman.

[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:36.100]
All right.

[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:42.320]
She lived her veil and exposed herself.

[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:45.500]
Buy New Cat Stevens collection today for 1995.

[00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:49.640]
Or you can pay with Visa, Mastercard or weapons of Maskey's drugs.

[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:52.480]
I'll tell you what's really impressive.

[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:55.360]
We have 789 friends on our MySpace page.

[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:56.100]
How do you like that?

[00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.520]
For an old guy like you?

[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:00.120]
For an old Fag like me.

[00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:00.940]
That's pretty impressive.

[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.820]
For a fat old out of touch, Fag like me.

[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:03.800]
That's pretty amazing.

[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:06.140]
It's only young living and breathing punks.

[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.860]
Pretty much that have MySpace page.

[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:11.180]
Nevertheless, I'll over keep Tiki Shaws on there and he's 168.

[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:15.180]
576 votes on the poll and most importantly 19.

[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:15.900]
That's a big number.

[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.360]
19 minutes away from that big 11 o'clock press conference at which Larry Coquette's going to give Ken.

[00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:22.540]
And probably Paul D's too, you know what you think?

[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:24.660]
No.

[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:25.420]
No?

[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:26.040]
Why not?

[00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:27.960]
Because what?

[00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:29.340]
Because the swim team's doing pretty good?

[00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:31.860]
The biggest names of best talent.

[00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:32.680]
That's a bad name.

[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:33.800]
Look at my ex.

[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:35.580]
Forch Radio 560.

[00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:36.940]
U-A-M.

[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:38.420]
Turkite f***ing blow.

[00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:26.420]
I'm dying out of here.

[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:30.180]
I'm gonna do something else.

[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:31.340]
Yeah, I couldn't fall.

[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:32.600]
But did you just want to run for sale?

[00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:33.620]
Yeah.

[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:34.740]
Yeah, I have.

[00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:35.020]
Yeah, I have.

[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:35.720]
Who's our name?

[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:36.660]
Patrick.

[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:36.920]

[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:36.920]

[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:36.920]

[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:36.920]

[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:36.920]

[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:36.920]

[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:36.920]

[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:36.920]

[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:36.920]

[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:36.920]

[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:36.920]

[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:36.920]

[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:36.920]

[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:36.920]

[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:36.920]

[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:37.440]
Patrick?

[00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:37.940]
Yeah.

[00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.980]
Just thought it was for the talk of someone named Fu.

[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:41.920]
Who?

[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:42.420]
Fu.

[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:44.720]
Okay, hold on a second, okay?

[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:44.980]
Yeah.

[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:46.780]
Yeah.

[00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:47.640]
Hello?

[00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:49.220]
How's that?

[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:50.120]
Yeah, who's speaking?

[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:51.160]
Huh?

[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:51.720]
Yeah.

[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:52.160]
Hello?

[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:53.540]
Who's speaking?

[00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:54.800]
Hello?

[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:55.780]
Hello?

[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:57.260]
Can you hear me?

[00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:57.840]
Yeah?

[00:32:58.420 --> 00:32:59.640]
You got a rest off of sale?

[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:00.580]
Huh?

[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:02.380]
How much you want for the sale?

[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.280]
Well, you come here to look at it and talk to the boss.

[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:08.500]
I come over, maybe eat dinner with you.

[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:09.000]
Okay.

[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:13.560]
Does that price include all the walks?

[00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:14.540]
Huh?

[00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:15.740]

[00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:16.240]
Huh?

[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:16.280]

[00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:17.260]
What's your name?

[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:18.980]
I'm Chinese.

[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:19.900]
Yeah, Chinese.

[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.060]
Okay, you come to talk to the boss.

[00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:24.120]
To the boss?

[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:25.100]
Yeah?

[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:26.300]
I'm two people.

[00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:27.440]
I'm two people.

[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:27.540]
I'm two people.

[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:29.080]
Yeah?

[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:30.420]
I'm two people.

[00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:31.120]
I'm two people.

[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:31.360]
I'm two people.

[00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:33.780]
Okay, how about I get all to go to the boss?

[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:59.320]
Then I come over and pick it up and look at the person.

[00:33:59.320 --> 00:33:59.620]
Okay.

[00:33:59.620 --> 00:33:59.620]

[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.200]
And now, language lab.

[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:05.060]
The show that teaches you a foreign language in less than 60 seconds.

[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:06.820]
Today's lesson, Greek.

[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:08.600]
Lesson 1.

[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.240]
Strawberry Pie.

[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.220]
Strawberry Pie.

[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:14.120]
Lesson 2.

[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:15.340]
Apple Pie.

[00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:17.020]
Apple Pie.

[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:18.940]
Lesson 3.

[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:20.500]
Pumpkin Pie.

[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:21.600]
Punky Pie.

[00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:23.220]
Customer.

[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.920]
What kind of pie do you have?

[00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:27.120]
Answer.

[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.740]
Apple Pie, Strawberry and Punky.

[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:31.640]
Language lab is a public service.

[00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:33.600]
I mean, not be copied or authorized for each cell thing.

[00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:34.260]
Hi, Lardies.

[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:36.380]
We don't make skinny little burgers.

[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:40.060]
Because skinny little burgers are for skinny little boys.

[00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:43.300]
Our monster big burgers are for big boys.

[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:47.200]
Big fat, large asses with no self-control.

[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:51.900]
Who chain smoke, winstance, and polish off a case of butt every night.

[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:57.080]
Now, for big boys, or so lazy they eat our breakfast bowl.

[00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:59.280]
Comes the ultimate morning feeding.

[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.660]
Introducing Lardies Breakfast Bucket.

[00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:05.480]
We start with three dozen fried eggs.

[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.220]
Top with six kinds of cheese.

[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.260]
Over a gallon of grits.

[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.260]
On a dozen biscuits.

[00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:17.000]
Smothered in gravy, maple syrup, and butter.

[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:21.020]
Topped off with a pancake the size of a manhole cover.

[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.900]
In a convenient five gallon bucket.

[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:27.840]
Together with hash browns and a 64 ounce mountain dew.

[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:30.580]
You've got the Lardies Breakfast Bucket combo.

[00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:32.660]
All for just $14.99.

[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.360]
Lardies without us.

[00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:37.840]
Some guys would live to see $40.

[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:45.560]
You've been broke from my internship at the Uranium Centiode.

[00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:49.940]
Well, I don't want to show you what a big ass said I was to you.

[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:50.660]
And how?

[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:54.620]
You're going to find somebody good enough to fill my piggy pants?

[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:56.380]
It ain't easy.

[00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:02.340]
Very no chicks, I love to be coming back.

[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:06.780]
I try to consider a lucrative and counteract.

[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:11.720]
If you want to know what I'll save you from shutting that transmitted devolving.

[00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:13.500]
Why? That's easy.

[00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:16.660]
I'm sure.

[00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:17.300]

[00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:19.380]
All you need is smoke.

[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:20.740]
What?

[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:21.000]

[00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:21.180]

[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:24.120]
All you need is smoke.

[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:25.440]
What?

[00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:25.780]
What?

[00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:25.980]

[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.880]
All you need is a show.

[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:29.980]
I don't know.

[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.240]
I'm sure.

[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:37.620]
I think your old dreams last only got you today.

[00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:41.980]
You stayed there by ratings that bottomed out in the night.

[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:46.580]
What's radio has to rebub me to answer the day it's the worst.

[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:49.420]
And we did.

[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:51.480]
Ah!

[00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:53.780]
All you need is smoke.

[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.780]
Now we can't get you.

[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:58.360]
All you need is smoke.

[00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:00.500]
We can't come out here to drink.

[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:02.840]
All you need is a show.

[00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:04.120]
It's so close.

[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:05.480]
Why?

[00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:06.760]
We'll come to the least.

[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:08.700]
We'll come to the least.

[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:09.980]
You have to fight away something.

[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:10.940]
Check.

[00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:11.900]
Hold me, I'll give you this.

[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:12.680]
Flap, you see.

[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:13.220]
Wow!

[00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:15.880]
Where are you going to just fly me?

[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.260]
I'll go down.

[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:18.620]
Down the bubble.

[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:20.320]
I'll go and you up.

[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:24.980]
Everyone knows about the chicken egg with the mark of a la.

[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:26.060]
Yum, yum.

[00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.500]
I would love to eat this most holy egg.

[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:30.520]
But I'm watching my cholesterol.

[00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:34.800]
That's why I switched to a la egg meters.

[00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:38.740]
A la egg meters look and taste like regular a la egg.

[00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:40.320]
But they're good for you.

[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:43.180]
So you can have this slim sexy body.

[00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:45.780]
You've always been forbidden to show in public.

[00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:47.800]
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:52.740]
Each carton of a la egg meters is made by 72 virgin chickens.

[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.160]
And part of this complete breakfast.

[00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:56.680]
But without the bacon.

[00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:59.600]
A la egg meters.

[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:00.900]
Death to America.

[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:04.240]
Ah!

[00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:05.840]
Who may I be helping you today?

[00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:09.300]
Will you please be having a blue slur big cheese?

[00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:10.860]
We are having a sale on camera.

[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:12.040]
R-A-G-G

[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.620]
We have had a lot of many flavors.

[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:14.940]
R-A-G

[00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:16.100]
I'm afraid that is not decent.

[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:19.640]
I'm a R-A-G-G-A-G-A-D-A-G

[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:21.220]
Okay, I'll tell you everything.

[00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:24.420]
I'm asking maybe for help with inside I think.

[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:24.720]
Hey!

[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.960]
The egg is destroyed with a women's bag.

[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:29.600]
It is only because it's better so bad.

[00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:32.160]
You can't blame a group of reactions on a group

[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.940]
but we don't want to drink out of the way we eat.

[00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:59.100]
We're like a group.

[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:28.320]
R-A-G-G-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A

[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:55.720]
R-A-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G

[00:39:55.720 --> 00:40:01.240]
Oh, really, I'm the tallest. Go home and leave us all alone.

[00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:05.920]
Maybe you'll leave me. I don't want to go back. I like shopping for free toys better.

[00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:22.760]
You've got your funky mom t-shirt, and you're making us ears.

[00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:26.280]
You've had your fun, now start packing.

[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:29.440]
So they can get you out of here.

[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:33.060]
In tap the point where we can't stand it.

[00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:35.940]
Everybody's high enough.

[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:39.400]
Above all the hoolly-y-yos and crackers.

[00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:42.760]
Roof with the darling's far as the...

[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:46.080]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, young girl, D'Aless.

[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:48.980]
Why don't you go home?

[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:52.640]
Yeah, they young girls, D'Aless.

[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.360]
Go home and leave us all alone.

[00:40:55.660 --> 00:41:00.400]
Very easy, look. They're giving away free, S&H green cards. Can I have one?

[00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:16.360]
And 55 at 56 WQM. It's one of those.

[00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:19.360]
It's our special. We do this every year.

[00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:23.060]
I'm not working no more on Thanksgiving Day. I'm through with that crap.

[00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:25.680]
Don't you agree? I agree.

[00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:27.940]
We're not going to work on the day after Thanksgiving.

[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:33.120]
Nevertheless, it's flag Friday. I wonder what Mike Richards will think about that.

[00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:37.360]
595 votes on the pool. What's your take on the callers?

[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:41.280]
We're leaving this pool off all the way. You ought to let Eric know if he's not paying any attention.

[00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:42.740]
I see him in the little window.

[00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:43.780]
I have no window.

[00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:45.340]
Probably not. He's probably passed out.

[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:48.160]
That's where you don't have any window because you don't have any Internet connection.

[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:51.520]
I have the connection now, but I don't have that window stuff.

[00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:57.540]
I want you to try to get on hotmail because I can't get on it either from Explorer or from Firefox Raving today.

[00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:00.660]
I had a little problem with that earlier in the week, but you can't even get on it.

[00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:04.840]
To check your email and all these things. What's going on with hotmail?

[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:06.100]
Can you get on it?

[00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:08.320]
Well, I don't have an account with them, but the website...

[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:09.720]
In that case, forget about it.

[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:12.900]
What's your take on the callers? 595 votes.

[00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:16.160]
Monday, we're starting to take calls again and play a lot of really a raunchy stuff.

[00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:21.320]
A few would be okay. 263. A few calls, like maybe, you know, two or three weeks.

[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:24.800]
Bring the calls back, damn it, 177.

[00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:28.900]
The show is fine without the calls. Only 78, 13%. Pretty weak.

[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.360]
The callers suck 74. Amen.

[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:33.600]
And I hate this pool. We'll tell you this.

[00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:39.180]
Still only 4 out of almost 600 votes. Our goal is 600 by the way we got 597.

[00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:42.880]
0.6% say they hate the pool. That's pretty low.

[00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:44.520]
Don't you think?

[00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:45.740]
Pretty low.

[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000]
Now, maybe the haters, the professional haters who ate everything we'd do on here.

[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:52.400]
Maybe they ate too much yesterday or got poisoned and croaked. Maybe they got botulism.

[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:55.260]
From eating some real uncooked bird or whatever to hell.

[00:42:56.880 --> 00:43:00.520]
Speaking of uncooked bird, Larry Kochhead's going to be fired in three minutes.

[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:03.720]
We're going to have the straight poop for you right here on your sports intensive stage.

[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:04.960]
The biggest name.

[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.980]
The best talent. The best is...

[00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:08.420]
So, by, Larry, watch your old toe.

[00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:10.080]
It's radio 560's.

[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:10.760]
Video game.

[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:13.680]
This has been The O'Ronger Show.

[00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:16.500]
This is your brain.

[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:17.180]
This is your brain.

[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:19.460]
Any questions?

[00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:22.000]
Some stations give you cats.

[00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:23.780]
Some stations give you cars.

[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:25.720]
But this station is going to give you more,

[00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:29.640]
because this station is going to give you a total human experience.

[00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:30.360]
That's right.

[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:33.560]
We're going to change your sex change.

[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:35.780]
You are the same.

[00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:37.300]
See how the other half of you did.

[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:41.120]
It's discovered just why you were so lousy and bad.

[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:43.140]
Look what it's like to ask for directions.

[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:45.320]
Girls, see what it's like to be a jerk.

[00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:50.460]
And when you hear this sound, you as a call and we'll change your sex.

[00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:52.760]
Change your sex.

[00:43:53.520 --> 00:44:00.500]
Winners of the sex change receive an all-in-spent-paid trip to Sweden where highly skilled surgeons will rip out the genitals, stop them in a plastic bag and shut in some new ones.

[00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:02.740]
Winners may keep their old genitals as a free gift.

[00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:07.800]
Employees of this station are not eligible to have their genitals ripped out free of charge but must do so if they're on expense.

[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:09.860]
You know you want to.

[00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:12.420]
No change, you're a sex. You just think to win.

[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:17.840]
Don't make the latest must-have sensation to hit stores. It's the tickle me bush doll.

[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:25.300]
This chattering little character from the Pennsylvania Avenue Beltway gang will laugh at anything you say.

[00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:28.980]
Till old George W. Sturthless is all dried up and he'll laugh.

[00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:36.800]
Tell him his military couldn't fight a Boy Scout jamboree on a warm summer day and he can't help but laugh.

[00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:45.980]
And you'll laugh too as this tickle me bush doll puckers his face to one side and wiggles his ape-like ears uncontrollably.

[00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:52.800]
Tickle me bush is sure to be the biggest thing since the Al Gore grows a beard gee-a-pet.

[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:57.480]
You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll kiss 49.99 goodbye with the tickle me bush doll.

[00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:59.760]
Every Republican household is sure to have one.

[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:06.440]
If you aren't now, 10% of every doll soul will support Stansel Research, the Missile Defenshield and Alaska Oil Drilling.

[00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:12.080]
He's got a-he's hysterical, he's got ape-like ears.

[00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:18.160]
He's the tickle me bush doll, counseled in stores where the guns ammo and NRA propaganda are sold.

[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:22.820]
Top male works by that.

[00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:24.200]
Timm the faith.

[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:26.500]
What is it?

[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:28.580]
He said, how am I a work just fine?

[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:32.300]
How am I a work for you if it's not working for me? That's number one.

[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:35.380]
And number two, how's Larry Koch had doing? I don't know yet.

[00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:44.960]
He's on trial for that fateful day. I am sure he's guilty as a jay.

[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:49.860]
Do you believe in Timm the faith?

[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:50.100]
No.

[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:51.880]
Dicourage.

[00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:56.840]
Thought it's turned up to the IRS.

[00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:02.280]
Jenner Greenow and the ATF.

[00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:07.240]
It's a good beat to him the press.

[00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:09.640]
Wide feet.

[00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:16.840]
Place that bomb and cause so much strife.

[00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:23.240]
Will he get the chair or instead?

[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:29.580]
Will he get life to the faith?

[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:33.880]
Paranoid about the USA.

[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:39.360]
Her room of that he might be gay.

[00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:43.640]
According to my 48.

[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:52.940]
I hate the government just as much as most of you.

[00:46:55.260 --> 00:47:01.060]
But I'm not even a rapper I have.

[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:04.060]
Oh, why you cute?

[00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:06.560]
Masha man.

[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:11.960]
Most of them are doing 8 to 10.

[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:16.640]
They can't have their weapons in the pen.

[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:19.380]
And what's in the faith?

[00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:23.440]
Be joining them.

[00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:26.380]
I'm dying over here.

[00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:28.440]
Oh, black.

[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:30.020]
Get out of here.

[00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:36.420]
14 feet above the key of it.

[00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:38.880]
It's like I picked a wrong week, Chris Moher.

[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:39.620]
It's in the 4 feet.

[00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:40.660]
In all three holes.

[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:42.120]
And in both rooms six.

[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:44.520]
It's like I picked a wrong week, quick drink.

[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:46.420]
When can we get on the way, damn it.

[00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:47.600]
Get that finger out of your ear.

[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:48.920]
You don't know where that finger's been.

[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:51.600]
That's five compartments and it looks like a big Tylenol.

[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:52.400]
She can stay in flow.

[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.960]
For the first four compartments briefs, but not five.

[00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:56.180]
Can't the barbarous stand with?

[00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:56.960]
Not five.

[00:47:57.340 --> 00:47:59.440]
It's like I picked a wrong week, when I'm fed a mace.

[00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:01.580]
The water will spill over the tops of the boat hits.

[00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:02.360]
There's no stopping.

[00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:05.100]
Here, here, here's a fire in the barn.

[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:06.540]
From this moment no matter what you do.

[00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:07.320]
Me, John.

[00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:08.140]
Big tree.

[00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:08.700]
Titanic.

[00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:09.800]
We'll fund her.

[00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:11.040]
I just want to tell you both good luck.

[00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:12.120]
We're all counting on you.

[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:14.620]
Well, I believe you may get your headlines, Mr. Smith.

[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:16.380]
There's a sale at pennies.

[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:19.340]
Jack, I want you to draw me like one of your French girls.

[00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:20.540]
Wearing this.

[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:22.400]
Where did you get that dress?

[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:25.240]
It's awful on those shoes in that coat.

[00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:26.360]
Shee-eees.

[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.880]
Limbic ice-capes, man.

[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:31.900]
It's like a dirty, dried tanya.

[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:33.280]
Tries to win.

[00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:38.320]
She was second best and it hurt her.

[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:40.900]
So, oh, oh, oh.

[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:43.880]
Nancy, care again.

[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:45.780]
The bitch was going to win again.

[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:48.280]
Ton, your blocks, ribbons.

[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:52.040]
Hires out a henchman.

[00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:55.580]
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

[00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:59.720]
That's Nancy, K, who's leaving ring.

[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:02.620]
She's knocked up from behind.

[00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:08.160]
Bang, bang, Ton, your silver hammer came down.

[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:10.600]
Upon her knee.

[00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:16.860]
Bang, bang, Ton, your silver hammer made sure of victory.

[00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:29.600]
A limbic middle round, Ton, your hidden ugly crown,

[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:31.700]
Pulled her every move.

[00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:35.340]
She can't find the groove.

[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:37.360]
She's off balance and power.

[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:39.140]
Oh, oh, oh.

[00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:46.460]
She foregoes a plan, makes her way into the stand murder on her mind.

[00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:51.100]
She has never minded a challenge.

[00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:53.800]
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:58.140]
The clouds they make are break for the door,

[00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:01.040]
But it's too late to run.

[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:07.300]
Bang, bang, Ton, your silver hammer just smashing me.

[00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:08.060]
She left.

[00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:15.440]
She would not leave Lil' amateur lumber on one's desk.

[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:27.880]
2048, Ton, your's at the Pollygate.

[00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:30.100]
St. Pete checks his book.

[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:35.020]
He gives her a look and he tells her,

[00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:37.880]
Now, oh, oh, oh.

[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:40.480]
She claims she's innocent,

[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:44.680]
Laces up and throws a fit eternity on the line.

[00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:50.280]
This guy's out of line and he's got to go.

[00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:52.120]
Oh, oh, oh.

[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:59.340]
As St. Pete was turning the page, Ton, your took her aim.

[00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:04.360]
Bang, bang, Ton, your silver hammer rang,

[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:07.000]
St. Pete's bell,

[00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:09.460]
But Skates got killed,

[00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:13.900]
No saints have never meant she went sped you hell.

[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:16.400]
1107, now let me ask you this.

[00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:18.700]
We got the word I'm Larry Cochrane or what?

[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:21.080]
Hold on.

[00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:24.400]
Wait, but the phone's ringing, the bat line,

[00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:26.580]
I bet you Miguel's gonna pick it up and the beast is gonna say,

[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:26.940]
Yeah.

[00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:27.260]
What is it?

[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:29.120]
It was a B patient call.

[00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:31.000]
What does that mean?

[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.480]
Meaning nothing, there's a buzz,

[00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:34.880]
But there's no official word yet.

[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:35.860]
There's a buzz?

[00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:36.560]
Right.

[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:41.500]
Yeah, and, and there's no official word.

[00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:43.380]
There's a buzz, but there's no official word yet.

[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:44.320]
There's a buzz?

[00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:45.100]
Right.

[00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:50.320]
Yeah, and, and there's no official word yet.

[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:53.960]

Yeah.

[00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:34.720]

I don't know.

[00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:51.400]
That's a good one.

[00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:23.680]
That's a good one.

[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:25.040]
That's a good one.

[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:25.040]

[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:25.040]

[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:25.040]

[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:25.040]

[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:25.040]

[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:25.040]

[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:25.060]
That's a good one.

[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:25.060]

[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:25.060]

[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:25.060]

[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:25.060]

[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:25.060]

[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:25.060]

[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:25.060]

[00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:25.760]
That's a good one.

[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:25.760]

[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:25.760]

[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:25.780]
That's a good one.

[00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:25.780]

[00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:25.780]

[00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:25.780]

[00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:26.940]

[00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:27.200]
This is a good one.

[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:27.220]
This is a good one.

[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:29.880]
This is a good one.

[00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:31.220]
Oh, it's cool.

[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:31.600]
Yeah, it's cool.

[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:31.600]

[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:31.600]

[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:31.600]

[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:31.940]
Here we go.

[00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:35.020]
The culture has been fired.

[00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:37.020]
We are just waiting for the formal announcement

[00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:37.780]
And red comment.

[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:39.160]
Bye, Bihlaeri.

[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:43.220]
Bye, Bihlaeri.

[00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:47.020]
We'll be silly, don't we, moon, me.

[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:49.240]
If you dumb enough to take that job,

[00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:50.460]
You deserve to get your ass fired.

[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:54.840]
If you dumb enough to take that job,

[00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:56.760]
You deserve to get your ass fired.

[00:54:56.760 --> 00:55:01.880]
Here his orange jumpsuit and her dowry

[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:09.920]
He's through a lot of people but he sometimes get caught

[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:14.700]
But God is the right in his new calm

[00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:29.600]
Anybody here, see good questions, doctor

[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:34.980]
To keep all around their time

[00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:41.940]
He's not the thickest yellow for truth before he's done

[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:46.980]
Taking a shower with his son

[00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:56.140]
You have a vision that is what the White House is doing for you

[00:55:56.140 --> 00:56:04.420]
Or a Christian to know what's best for you and me

[00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:08.540]
A grave of all that is

[00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:12.360]
He was in a sun before

[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:18.360]
In other words, do he have anybody here

[00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:21.900]
Please say time to lay me

[00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:27.680]
Born a skeleton, a fox, a hoist

[00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:34.860]
These kindness lies, they long and can't pay why

[00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:38.060]
Aver lost out to the man

[00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:46.580]
The biggest name of the best challenge to the best is

[00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:47.340]
Neil Rogers

[00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:51.520]
Don't have this

[00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:54.480]
You think Josh Cortis is on top of this?

[00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:56.240]
Or is there somebody else put this on there?

[00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:58.760]
Well, Gryper's here, he might have done it. It's on his piano

[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:03.360]
WQM has learned that Larry Cochers has been fired as head coach of the University of Miami

[00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:08.280]
The official announcement came from states that Cochers has been released from his contract

[00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:12.680]
O'Leary, in addition, now that Miami is bull eligible

[00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:18.080]
Oh my god, what a joke, should they be invited to a bull game like the Orville Red and Bacher popcorn bull

[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:20.740]
Cochers will coach the team in the bull game

[00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:26.340]
The fired coach, wouldn't that be an emotional thing? You know when they play like Liberty State Girl School

[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.700]
After last night, 17-14 win over Boston College

[00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:33.920]
The problem is a quick resolution was expected and that is now the case, you're out Larry, bye-bye

[00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:39.100]
UM defensive coordinator Randy Shannon is qualified to be a candidate to replace Cochers

[00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:43.200]
Head coach Greg Skiano is in play, but there are some, what?

[00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:48.060]
Shannon Greg, somebody rather, but there are some contractual obstacles in the way

[00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:50.640]
Miami would need permission to talk to Ski O'Shiano

[00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:54.700]
In addition, Rutger's season doesn't end until December the 2, well there you go

[00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:57.200]
I think Seth Greenberg is the man

[00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:58.580]
He's a hard guy, he's f**king blow

[00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:00.900]
Come on Seth

[00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:05.540]
Ooh, I might have heard they made a switch

[00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:09.820]
A rock has a new president that's on the nickname

[00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:13.940]
I hear this word out on the street

[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:17.320]
Got a big surprise, winning ball

[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:20.340]
This new criminal chief working on a car bomb

[00:58:22.220 --> 00:58:25.000]
The working on a car bomb, yeah

[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:28.980]
Stepping fine and safe, I got a car bomb

[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:33.440]
Maybe a night limbo, seeing as a car bomb, yeah

[00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:34.380]
Oh, right

[00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:39.360]
Ooh, these loyal lips will hit your heart

[00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:44.640]
I reckon a place to be if you're some political star

[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:47.980]
Getting in your car ain't always cool

[00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:52.500]
So have the show fucking in first, don't you feel good?

[00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:53.900]
Getting on a car bomb

[00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:58.940]
The working on a car bomb, yeah

[00:58:58.940 --> 00:59:02.760]
Turn that key on his finger, you know, a car bomb

[00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:07.240]
New president's better watch out for the car bomb, yeah

[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:14.660]
And now, getting involved with Blue Rose & House

[00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:19.120]

For those who don't already know, give us a little background on yourself

[00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:30.740]
I am responsible for every famous sports figure you've ever known

[00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:33.760]
Since the beginning of time, I discovered spoticus

[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:38.280]
And such a page, Babe Ruth, Mark Throneberry, that was me

[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:42.600]
I discovered Lannitona from Lincoln on down all the US presidents

[00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:45.640]
That was me, I put Neil Armstrong on the moon

[00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:49.560]
In fact, it was I who invented the very phone we're talking on

[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:52.180]
What have you done for us right here in South Florida?

[00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:54.940]
I got your Randall Terry for the dolphins, that was me

[00:59:54.940 --> 00:59:58.500]

[00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:00.220]

You will only find on Drew Rose & House

[01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:28.260]
Drew, are they real?

[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:29.200]
The genuine article

[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:31.580]
Tell you what, Drew, how would you like a female companion?

[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:33.760]
Well, it's no secret, I like girls

[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.480]
I'll introduce you to our programs director

[01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:39.400]
It's a guy, isn't it?

[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:41.280]
Yeah, but more girl than you know

[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:42.360]
That's the situation I guess

[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:43.640]
He has very soft arms

[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.040]
I'd rather rape Mohal

[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:47.040]
Thanks for joining us Drew

[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:50.620]
We'll be back with more fake collars after these words from Glory Hold Paradise

[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:11.560]
He's got a job for you to do

[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:13.440]
Oh

[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:17.120]
Oh

Oh

Oh

[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:21.720]
Oh

[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:21.720]

[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:21.720]

[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:21.720]

[01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:23.020]
Oh

[01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:23.060]
Oh

[01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:23.060]

[01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:23.360]
Oh

[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:23.360]

[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:23.360]

[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:23.380]
Oh

[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:35.320]
Oh

[01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:43.200]
Oh

[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:43.360]
Oh

[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:43.860]
Oh

[01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:45.260]
Oh

[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:45.660]
Oh

[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:50.400]
Who's with the speed of a gazelle?

[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:54.220]
Sense of that dice straight to hell

[01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:57.320]
When a filmings starts to blow

[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:59.020]
We know you need to then be done

[01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:02.380]
Your thrushing cry with both my heat blow

[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:10.980]
First grade

[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:17.040]
First you get down on your knees

[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.940]
Fiddle with your rosaries

[01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:21.460]
Bow your head with great respect and

[01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:23.400]
Change you flex, change you flex, change you flex

[01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:32.160]
To whatever steps you want if you have cleared them with the pontiff

[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:33.480]
Everybody say his own career

[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:35.680]
He lays on doing the band again right

[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:53.900]
Get in line in that processional step into that small confessional

[01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:58.140]
They're the guy who's got religion, I'll tell you if your sins are original

[01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:02.360]
If it is, try playing it safer, drink the wine and chew the wafer

[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:06.600]
Two or four, six, eight, aint' on time to transubstantiate

[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:09.080]
So get down upon your knees

[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.960]
Fiddle with your rosaries

[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:13.440]
Bow your head with great respect and

[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:15.280]
Change you flex, change you flex, change you flex

[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:17.420]
Take a cross on your abdomen

[01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:20.560]
When in Rome, do like a Roman, our Bain Maria

[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:21.900]
She's good to see you

[01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:24.080]
Get an expanded cast on a dramatic end

[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:25.640]
And do an abat again right

[01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:32.980]
The pad smells so bad

[01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:34.840]
The ponts smells so bad

[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:36.160]
God gave him the grass

[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:38.080]
The ponts smells so bad

[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:39.720]
Her heat likes a smokin' mask

[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:42.180]
The ponts smells so bad

[01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:43.200]
He's a good head

[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:45.540]
The ponts smells so bad

[01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:48.060]
The ponts smells so bad

[01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:53.440]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:58.680]
Guys, I am a killer, taking high f-back

[01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:00.820]
Homes in Rome get thrown on breath

[01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:02.300]
Jesus freaks out back

[01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:04.020]
Jesus freaks out super

[01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:05.960]
If he never shall have tried

[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:08.060]
Pops him won't get thrown on breath

[01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:09.540]
He's a church at truck

[01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:11.940]
The ponts smells so bad

[01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:12.900]
God gave him the grass

[01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:15.260]
The ponts smells so bad

[01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:16.520]
He likes a smokin' mask

[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:19.060]
The ponts smells so bad

[01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:19.980]
He's a good head

[01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:22.480]
The ponts smells so bad

[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:24.300]
The ponts smells so bad

[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.480]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:32.040]
Oh yeah, oh yeah

I was like, you can tell I'm not there

[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:36.160]
He's a good kid, he's a beller, watch that

[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:38.000]
Chill forget to take your pill

[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.500]
Now she's got it, don't say

[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:41.420]
Take the pills and not age

[01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:42.960]
Hold the power, throw it, poke

[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:44.840]
First and he's talking to you

[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:46.560]
Don't come down, I wanna smoke

[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:48.720]
The ponts, stomping

[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:50.240]
God gave him the grass

[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:52.440]
The ponts smell so bad

[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:53.960]
He likes a smokin' mask

[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:56.260]

[01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:07.180]
The biggest name of the best talent to do this is Neil Rogers, 4th radio 560, QAM.

[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:12.160]
I'm never happy to ever get to say hello.

[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:14.180]
Hi!

[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:15.960]
Hello.

[01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:18.620]
Aren't you coach poker?

[01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:19.520]
Yes.

[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:22.480]
Forgive me, I don't always dodge.

[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:25.980]
But I listen to this for a whole radio all the time.

[01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:28.540]
And they drop their names so many times.

[01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:29.980]
I become your biggest fan.

[01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:32.140]
Congrats, thank you very much.

[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:36.040]
Not to mention, Cain is so nice and easy to say.

[01:06:36.380 --> 01:06:36.820]
Okay!

[01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:37.900]
Oh, I know.

[01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:38.560]
Yeah.

[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:40.420]
Helps me feel an aesthetic.

[01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:42.680]
My own so lonely life.

[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000]
I'm glad to hear it.

[01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:46.400]
I even got the badge!

[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:50.680]
Yeah, that's great.

[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:53.000]
You know what that's going for?

[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:54.700]
Oh yeah.

[01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:59.580]
Let me feel a manhole with the hat.

[01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:00.280]
That's right.

[01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:01.600]
I mean tonight.

[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.360]
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:06.980]
Mind if I grab your gold post, take me sports!

[01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:07.300]
Sports!

[01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:08.540]
Fords.

[01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:09.400]
Fords.

[01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:12.600]
Things go better with poker.

[01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:16.880]
That that that that that that that that's you.

[01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:26.360]
Never washed his hair or seemed to have a care, Kobe.

[01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:32.060]
His name was Kurt.

[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:35.340]
Now he's pushing up dirt, Kobe.

[01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:37.440]
I'm dying out of here.

[01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:44.280]
Wiping drew from his chin, doing heroin, Kobe.

[01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:51.500]
Your father was hot and now it's Kurt.

[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:53.300]
They ain't got Kobe.

[01:07:56.520 --> 01:08:00.760]
He got high, said goodbye, then he died.

[01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:02.280]
Kobe.

[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:15.740]
Made a million an hour, never took a shower, Kobe.

[01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:24.720]
He's a number one hit in heaven's Big Mosh Pit, Kobe.

[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:33.760]
He'll meet Elvis the King and say grunge was my thing, Kobe.

[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:42.720]
So if you're filled with doubt, don't take Kurt's way out, Kobe.

[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:46.800]
Kobe.

[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:50.220]
He got high, said goodbye, then he died.

[01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:51.780]
Kobe.

[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:55.160]
Wow.

[01:08:56.460 --> 01:08:57.840]
Hey, how you doing, honey?

[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:02.240]
This is Bill Flatt in the present and I'm the United States.

[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:05.420]
And this is my state of the women's dress.

[01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:10.260]
I've known a few girls who thought that were pretty hot,

[01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:12.960]
but Bill is here to tell you that girl.

[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:13.860]
You're not.

[01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:18.100]
They used to wear makeup and whip away pants,

[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:21.820]
but when they looked at me, they were under much rions.

[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:25.620]
Whoa, you think you're special.

[01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:30.000]
Whoa, you think you're something else.

[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:32.980]
So Paula Jones, you got a new nose.

[01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:35.460]
That dumb impression lay much.

[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.020]
Ha, ha, ha.

[01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:41.180]
Well, you got the brain, but if you got the touch,

[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:42.880]
then don't get me wrong.

[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:44.780]
Well, I'll blank you alright,

[01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:50.180]
but that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night.

[01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:53.820]
That dumb impression lay much.

[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:55.860]
Ha, ha, ha.

[01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:57.300]
What's new to all, jelly?

[01:09:57.940 --> 01:09:58.420]
Ha, ha, ha.

[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:00.120]
I think you'll remember this one.

[01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:04.080]
She had a tight break order, but she kept on in phone.

[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:07.800]
And after she ate steak, she would bury the bone.

[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:11.720]
She got herself some life, oh, and a tummy tuck.

[01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:15.420]
But she still has ugly as a hockin' plug.

[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:19.600]
Whoa, she's like she's something special.

[01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:23.620]
Whoa, she's like she's something else.

[01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:26.660]
So when the trip got some surgery,

[01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:29.400]
that dumb impression lay much.

[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:30.680]
Ha, ha, ha.

[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:34.980]
Well, you got the brain, but if you got the touch,

[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:36.820]
then don't get me wrong.

[01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:38.700]
Yeah, I'll blank you alright,

[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:43.220]
but that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night.

[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:47.680]
That dumb impression lay much.

[01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:49.860]
Ha, ha, ha.

[01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:51.780]
Oh, I keep forgotten everybody.

[01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:53.900]
Oh, yeah, I bought this next one.

[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:57.780]
A big chunky girl with a purple right.

[01:10:57.780 --> 01:11:02.060]
That name gaped dress nearly put their way.

[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:05.380]
Well, secret meetings on my car with no,

[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:09.400]
I could've told Wilk Jamerlin the hottest score.

[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:13.540]
Whoa, she's like she's special.

[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:17.740]
Whoa, she's like she's something else.

[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:20.600]
So Monica, you lost 40 pounds.

[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:23.020]
That dumb impression lay much.

[01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:24.900]
Ha, ha, ha.

[01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:28.880]
Well, you got the brain, but if you got the touch,

[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.560]
then don't get me wrong.

[01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:32.600]
Well, I'll blank you alright,

[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:37.120]
but that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night.

[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:38.980]
Ha, ha, ha.

[01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:41.480]
That dumb impression lay much.

[01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:44.800]
Ha, ha, ha.

[01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:46.420]
I've saved the best for last.

[01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:51.940]
Well, I tried to cut the brakes on her car.

[01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:55.840]
No offense, but I think I'd rather sleep with get a star.

[01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:59.900]
When she gives birth, I think her offspring should hatch.

[01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:03.480]
Big old wags, and an ass to match.

[01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:07.440]
Whoa, she thinks she's special.

[01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:09.020]
Ha, ha, ha.

[01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:11.480]
She thinks she's something else.

[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:14.600]
So Hillary, you're going to be a son of her from New York.

[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:16.880]
Not dumb and press me much.

[01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:18.620]
Ha, ha, ha.

[01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:22.660]
Well, you got the brain, but if you got the touch,

[01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:24.500]
then don't get me wrong.

[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:26.440]
I'll blank you alright,

[01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:31.060]
but that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night.

[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:32.800]
Ha, ha, ha.

[01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:35.120]
That dumb impression lay much.

[01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:36.580]
Ha, ha.

[01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:39.200]
Like you, that is my state in the women's dress.

[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:40.580]
I love you.

[01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:43.460]
I told my friend that 560 WQM said we find out

[01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:45.620]
is mad dog on the day or Curtis or um...

[01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:49.500]
Tom Pervisian, Ralph Dupin, you know.

[01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:50.460]
Too much blood you've got.

[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:51.220]
I've been worried about mad dog.

[01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:51.820]
Oh.

[01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:54.640]
Okay, somebody would be on a two-way to mad dog or Curtis

[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:56.140]
or maybe a clearance, you know.

[01:12:56.460 --> 01:12:59.080]
No, Clarice has got that big UM basketball tomorrow.

[01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:00.780]
UM in Lafayette.

[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:02.200]
Ha, ha, ha.

[01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:04.000]
Lafayette, my ass.

[01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:04.380]
Wow.

[01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:06.680]
659 votes on a pool.

[01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:08.140]
I think we'll make our 750 today.

[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:08.700]
Maybe not.

[01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:09.660]
Maybe not.

[01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:11.520]
I think, like I said, 700s are gold.

[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:14.300]
If we get to 750, we'll be like a little cream on the cake

[01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:15.920]
on the punky pie.

[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:18.220]
Do you have any punky pie yesterday?

[01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:19.980]
I don't have any of the above yesterday.

[01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:20.640]
Well, that's right.

[01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:22.780]
You had to work the football game last night, didn't you?

[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:23.020]
Yep.

[01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:25.660]
And here I was asking if you saw the really good game last night

[01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:26.680]
Denver and Kansas City.

[01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:28.520]
Well, that was a game that if Trent Green would have played

[01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:30.180]
against it often, it's a man that'd kick their ass,

[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:31.420]
but it's a good thing he didn't.

[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:36.720]
659 votes, what's your take on the cars on this show?

[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:38.980]
Which I think they're coming back Monday is the rumor I'm starting.

[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:42.220]
All of it all depends on how I feel over the weekend

[01:13:42.220 --> 01:13:43.720]
and how I do it that would bind tomorrow.

[01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:45.660]
A few callers would be okay.

[01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:48.960]
300, nice even number, few, not too many, not too few.

[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:52.180]
Bring the calls back, 195, gosh dang it.

[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:56.160]
The show is fine without the calls, 81, a mere 12.2%.

[01:13:56.740 --> 01:13:59.820]
The caller is suck, 79, and I hate this pool.

[01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:01.800]
Still, only four.

[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:06.420]
Still, 0.6% out of all, 660 votes, damn near.

[01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:07.040]
How do you like that?

[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:09.020]
Are you impressed or what?

[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:11.500]
Of course, the big news is Larry Coquette's out at UM.

[01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:13.260]
Do you realize he was there for 12 years?

[01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:15.380]
And do you realize the reason they call this black Friday?

[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:19.160]
Why is that? Have you ever figured it out?

[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:19.520]
No.

[01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:22.440]
I never did either until I saw the crawl on CNN a few minutes ago.

[01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:25.520]
This is the day when retailers, most retailers go into the black.

[01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:26.440]
Oh.

[01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:28.240]
Because they do so much business today.

[01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:29.600]
That's why they call it black Friday.

[01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:32.820]
It's not a racial thing in spite of what that guy from Seinfeld said.

I got a window down on a hot summer day because the AC don't work no way.

[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:26.120]
The sweating pressure loss eats thoughts dispel and gets the dusty look in over time.

[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:31.200]
I'm impacting you by the shiny grand as my lag ride.

[01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:34.780]
Thanks my comment, Janet, to be reserving Washington with all the roads.

[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:37.200]
The more the heyways.

[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:40.220]
Open up Nevada Jerry Jerry.

[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:41.400]
You can leave it here.

[01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:43.460]
Stop baby.

[01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:47.060]
Michael Schaffek, please go and vote as people.

[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:47.920]
Sing from school.

[01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:49.920]
Stop baby.

[01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:53.040]
Fresh from the volunteering of the fans.

[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:54.540]
To be leaving this.

[01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:56.580]
Stop baby.

[01:16:58.080 --> 01:16:59.720]
Hey hey hey hey hey.

[01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:00.500]
That's it.

[01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:07.180]
Hey hey hey hey hey.

[01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:10.220]
Hacking sectors are towering.

[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:12.940]
All tamer act with him.

[01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:17.240]
On a cold attack and a coveture about the going next door.

[01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:21.740]
They all drive for half a mile a day where.

[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:28.860]
That Gucci smile and they stand in line a while with no mere labor.

[01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:30.760]
Leave Manhattan.

[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:32.880]
The rubs and grids.

[01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:34.220]
That's an island too.

[01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:35.680]
Leave the Brooklyn city.

[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:37.000]
Hit the tunnel.

[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:38.880]
And go look back.

[01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:41.820]
Down the Jersey turn back to tamer act.

[01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:42.840]
Throw all the moths.

[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:45.820]
And the sidewalks hail from your hair.

[01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:47.740]
As you wrap your nails.

[01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:48.760]
Tell your friends.

[01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:50.200]
You're going to blooming.

[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:52.860]
They'll mainly won't fit far behind.

[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:19.080]
Leave Manhattan.

[01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:20.920]
The rubs and grids.

[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:22.180]
That's an island too.

[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:23.680]
Leave the Brooklyn city.

[01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:24.860]
Hit the tunnel.

[01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:26.880]
And go look back.

[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:29.820]
Down the Jersey turn back to tamer act.

[01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:30.740]
Throw all the moths.

[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:33.640]
And the sidewalks hail from your hair.

[01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:35.660]
As you wrap your nails.

[01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:36.700]
Tell your friends.

[01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:38.120]
You're going to blooming.

[01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:41.080]
They'll mainly won't fit far behind.

[01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:42.520]
Down south.

[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:44.560]
Pass hack and sack.

[01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:45.500]
There's a town.

[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:48.380]
Call tamer act where you live.

[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:50.520]
On a call to sack.

[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:36.260]

[01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:43.440]
than that little old lady from Iowa.

[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.820]
She crawled and she saw she was a real fart.

[01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:48.680]
She's a zero half counter.

[01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:50.180]
She'll be fur subtractive.

[01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:52.540]
She's a little old lady from Iowa.

[01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:58.540]
It's a little old lady from higher league

[01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:02.220]
Very slow, very slow, very slow

[01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:05.560]
You've cut your oven, act like you've never seen ya

Very slow, very slow, very slow

[01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:10.900]
Don't try and blow your horn to agitate

[01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:14.240]
Because she'll only keep sucking on a respirator

[01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:20.240]
Now I can't think of no one who would make me meaner

[01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:23.020]

Oh, it's right!

[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:02.040]
I heard it said too

[01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:05.980]
I think I'm gonna be a head

[01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:08.340]

But girl, I'm going to win

[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:15.060]
It's game 25

[01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:20.840]
She's gotta took her so wide

[01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:21.660]
Wrecked

[01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:24.380]
She's gotta took her so wide

[01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:25.180]
I'm high

[01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:28.100]
She's gotta took her so wide

[01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:29.920]
And she don't care

[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:35.240]
She says that's the waiting place

[01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:36.960]
My cause of distress

[01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:39.020]
Yeah

[01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:42.580]
I don't know how she will fit

[01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:45.180]
And her waiting dress

[01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:50.440]
She's gotta took her so wide

[01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:53.900]
She's gotta took her so wide

[01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:54.640]
I'm high

[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:55.320]
I don't know

[01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:57.620]
She's gotta took her so wide

[01:21:57.620 --> 01:21:59.320]
And she don't care

[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:05.000]
I'll tell you why you've finished your wife

[01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:08.660]
She'll be right, she'll work out in no more

[01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:12.320]
She's gonna have to go on a diet

[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:16.140]
To look like she did once before

[01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:21.340]
I've done everything that I could

[01:22:21.340 --> 01:22:23.680]
I've needed that

[01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:28.840]
To try the opposite way

[01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:30.720]
Or see Jenny Craig

[01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:36.380]
Oh, it's she's gotta took her so wide

[01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:40.420]

I'm high

[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:43.500]
She's gotta took her so wide

[01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:45.360]
And she don't care

[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:51.160]
I'll tell you why you've finished your wife

[01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:55.520]
She'll be right, she'll work out in no more

[01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:58.440]
She's gotta have to go on a diet

[01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:01.800]
To look like she did once before

[01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:07.540]
I think I'll try it like this

[01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:09.620]
And it's by some chance

[01:23:10.620 --> 01:23:11.220]
Yeah

[01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:14.660]
It is too tight in the waist

[01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:18.080]
I'll get some stretch pants

[01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:22.500]
Because I've got a took a so wide

[01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:25.960]

I've got a took a so wide

[01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:31.440]
We make it good fair

[01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:35.440]
We make it good fair

[01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:39.880]
We make it good fair

[01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:42.720]
We make it good fair

[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:46.340]
We make it good fair

[01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:49.860]
They're bad

[01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:51.580]
They're obscene

[01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:53.340]
Their records are unavailable

[01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:55.060]
And they're Jewish

[01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:59.940]
It's too live Jews as kosher as they want to be

[01:23:59.940 --> 01:24:03.560]
With too live Jews and this rat rocks

[01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:05.280]
Give me a bagel

[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:07.060]
Make mine with blocks

[01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:08.400]
I met this fox

[01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:10.320]
She wanted my pickle

[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:12.180]
I told her it was kosher

[01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:14.040]
She didn't take the gold

[01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:15.340]
I'm no schmuck

[01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:17.120]
You'll get your wish

[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:18.820]
Open up wide

[01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:20.600]
Eat your filter fish

[01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:22.200]
With too live Jews

[01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:23.120]
I'm psych

[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:24.160]
I'm motion

[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:25.780]
If you think this is nasty

[01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:27.680]
Something in kosher

[01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:29.620]
Kosher, what's kosher?

[01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:30.800]
This is my agent

[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:31.780]
Are you ham?

[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:32.800]
You got a question

[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:34.780]
I need a question

[01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:35.880]
Give me a share

[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:38.180]

And his whole family trafiest today on Thanksgiving

[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:47.460]
How do you like that?

[01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:49.320]
That's because I'm an old bastard

[01:24:49.940 --> 01:24:51.780]

You don't know who?

[01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:53.620]

[01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:55.120]
Oh it is Curtis

[01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:56.980]

Why the hell would he come in on a Friday?

[01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:00.020]
On a holiday

[01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:02.240]
Curtis said who does in the pines did you say?

[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:02.640]
Correct

[01:25:03.100 --> 01:25:04.360]
Because it says here, Pompano

[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:06.860]
And then of course the opanthers in the Washington senators

[01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:10.360]
And they're paying this puss for this crap

[01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:12.820]
Now you don't have to have a job, Clarence, just stay the hell away

[01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:13.580]
You idiot

[01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:14.140]
You silly

[01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:14.660]

This is Brandy Quinn

[01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:19.080]
Whenever I shake my balls

[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:21.660]
I listen to the meal Rogers 12 to 1 hour

[01:25:23.060 --> 01:25:25.520]

[01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:28.520]
Linda Linda Linda

[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:31.680]
Linda Linda Linda

[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:33.400]
Linda chips a fat thing

[01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:38.660]
Daddy looks like a guy

[01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:40.300]
He looks like a guy

[01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:42.280]
She's 70 wide

[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:46.960]
She makes me want to the shrine

[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:47.840]

chips a fat thing

[01:25:51.060 --> 01:25:52.420]
A chick with a dick

[01:25:53.060 --> 01:25:54.360]
With a dick

[01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:56.200]
With two smelly gins

[01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:57.400]
A chick

[01:25:58.060 --> 01:26:00.960]
A bloated and ugly fat thing

[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:02.000]
That's how Linda

[01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:07.500]
She wants the media to stop the music

[01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:11.160]
And Rhythm Harren asks with songs like this

[01:26:12.060 --> 01:26:14.620]
But we find that a music

[01:26:14.620 --> 01:26:18.620]
From that self-promoting ugly bitch

[01:26:20.220 --> 01:26:22.080]
How much were you paying?

[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:23.940]
How much were you paying?

[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:25.540]
For Monica's Day

[01:26:25.540 --> 01:26:27.440]
For Monica's Day

[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:30.060]
By Richardson, Melon's Day

[01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:33.080]
That's what Linda Linda Linda

[01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:34.700]
chips a fat thing

[01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:37.980]
I wish you always leave me alone

[01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:41.560]
I'm just like everyone else who out there

[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:45.620]
I know you'll make me do this

[01:26:45.620 --> 01:26:47.000]
We'll be in love with your privacy

[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:51.220]
Just who do you think you're a fooling?

[01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:54.300]
You had a conscious ugly smelly thing

[01:26:55.620 --> 01:26:58.420]
You're really that drive-shin' a dress

[01:26:58.420 --> 01:27:01.400]
A queen of me

chips a fat thing

[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:08.400]
Child obesity is a national epidemic

[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:11.520]
But how can you teach your kids healthy eating habits?

[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:15.120]
It's easy with low carb Mr. Potato Head

[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:19.000]
Cool low carb Mr. Potato Head to ears are made out of bacon

[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.700]
And his feet are made out of lamb chops

[01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:27.740]
Yes all the parts of low carb Mr. Potato Head are made from all the healthy food your kids should eat

[01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:32.380]
Put in eyes made from steak or a mouth made from pork loin

[01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:34.060]

That's why you should never eat vegetables

[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:41.560]
or fruit or bread or dairy products

[01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:45.000]
If you want your kids to grow up healthy

[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.500]

[01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:50.660]

It puts the lotion in the basket

[01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:18.380]
It's to rub it on my bread

It puts the lotion in the basket

And Congress wants him to explain

[01:30:13.940 --> 01:30:15.500]

Kids just hate getting animals

[01:30:58.380 --> 01:30:59.860]
And moms hate giving them

[01:30:59.860 --> 01:31:01.660]
But now there's a brand new animal

[01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:02.900]

[01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:09.720]
Hey mom, can I have another animal?

[01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:12.460]

[01:31:12.460 --> 01:31:14.420]

[01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:30.600]
Bracum

[01:31:37.060 --> 01:31:39.900]

[01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:01.400]
He goes down on his knees

[01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:02.620]

He loves to slap cowboys on their behind

[01:32:17.180 --> 01:32:20.460]
He's got a spotless reputation

[01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:25.400]
America's team is world renowned

[01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:29.260]
But is Troy gay?

[01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:32.560]
I've heard some people say

[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:36.040]
In the heart, he goes down

[01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:38.380]

Don't let them cause he likes it from behind

[01:32:56.380 --> 01:32:58.100]
Oh oh oh oh, right

[01:33:01.020 --> 01:33:02.320]
I'm on a nijad

[01:33:03.540 --> 01:33:05.020]
I'm on a nijad

[01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:07.500]

With the big and scrappy beard

[01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:21.140]
And he wears a brown jacket that looks like he bought it

[01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:22.520]
And then the red public

[01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:24.440]
Off the discount rack

[01:33:24.980 --> 01:33:26.080]

[01:33:27.660 --> 01:33:28.700]
I'm on a nijad

[01:33:32.780 --> 01:33:34.960]
I'm on a nijad

[01:33:36.580 --> 01:33:38.500]
Hey, do you want to run faster?

[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.400]
Job higher and make the blind see again?

[01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:43.580]
Why do you want to move like the wind?

[01:33:43.940 --> 01:33:46.400]

So every part of your foot is always walking on water

[01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:32.600]

Woke up at 2 p.m.

[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:47.760]
Face down in a gutter

[01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:50.040]
My mouth tasted like mong

[01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:52.740]
My brain was like butter

[01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:54.800]
Crawled up on my feet

[01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:57.420]
Brushed myself off

[01:34:57.420 --> 01:34:59.540]
Little for stoke

[01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:02.840]
F, F, started to cough

I'm entering the apartment complex of my blind date

[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.900]
I hope she's slender and beautiful and a virgin

[01:35:40.900 --> 01:35:44.640]
You know how I like to go boldly where no man has gone before

[01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:49.420]
Hello, honey, my god

[01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:51.040]
She's huge

[01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:54.900]
She's got her own gravitational pull

[01:35:54.900 --> 01:35:56.900]
Must have taken a train

[01:35:56.900 --> 01:35:59.560]
Scotty, beam me up quick

[01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:00.920]
I can't eat you, it's Captain

[01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:03.140]
She's got the pull of me

[01:36:03.140 --> 01:36:07.960]
That's all tonight on an out of this world episode of star dates

[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:10.920]

I've gotten tired of getting money away

[01:36:26.060 --> 01:36:27.320]
If you have a Christian

[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:28.520]
Or a Christian

[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:31.720]

I ain't gonna work in no more

[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:41.200]
Well, I was a Christian

[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:42.800]
Soldier of God

[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:45.660]
A believer of these years

[01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:48.300]
All that time

[01:36:48.300 --> 01:36:49.600]
I followed every word

[01:36:49.900 --> 01:36:51.380]
Of the scriptures

[01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:54.040]
Written by queers

[01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:55.520]
Catch keys

[01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:57.640]
To ease the powerful God

[01:36:57.640 --> 01:37:00.580]
And an unknown one in a mighty way

[01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:03.160]
Except in 9-11

[01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:05.020]
When he must have been gone

[01:37:05.020 --> 01:37:07.480]
On a bust-win holiday

[01:37:08.740 --> 01:37:11.680]
Take your card and shove it

[01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:15.120]
I ain't gonna work in no more

[01:37:15.900 --> 01:37:16.680]

But you're all right

[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:20.140]
If your wind looks

[01:37:20.140 --> 01:37:22.520]
Because everybody else is wrong

[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:27.100]
And I'm getting tired of watching people die

[01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:29.360]
And the name of it is visible

[01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:30.100]
Lord

[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:33.800]
Take your card and shove it

[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:34.800]
All right

[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:37.100]
I ain't gonna work in no more

[01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:37.600]
No

[01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:41.240]
Take your card and shove it

[01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:41.780]
All right

[01:37:41.780 --> 01:37:44.620]
I ain't gonna work in no more

[01:37:44.620 --> 01:37:46.520]
Why tell you one thing? This is mighty enjoyable

[01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:48.420]
In fact, it's going over like Calabai

[01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:50.200]
And Jerusalem, you know what's going over pretty good

[01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:51.680]
With me, I don't know about you, but

[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:53.380]
What? Excuse me, what? Exactly

[01:37:54.300 --> 01:37:56.660]
709 votes, how do you like that? I think we should go for 800

[01:37:56.660 --> 01:37:59.140]
You said 8 before and I thought, well, this man is a maniac

[01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:03.380]
Probably too many refried beans on Thanksgiving Day

[01:38:03.860 --> 01:38:05.680]
I know it's a Mexican thing, but God

[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:07.360]
I think I'm going to Taco Bell today

[01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:09.740]
You know what sounds really good to me?

[01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:11.860]
And Omelette, you take a burrito supreme

[01:38:11.860 --> 01:38:13.600]
You take all the insides out

[01:38:14.060 --> 01:38:15.700]
And you put it inside an omelette

[01:38:16.180 --> 01:38:16.620]
Okay

[01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:17.740]
Doesn't that sound good? Sure

[01:38:17.740 --> 01:38:19.840]
As opposed to eating the burrito, which is loaded with carbs

[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:21.320]
And probably gonna give me an oil clog

[01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:23.140]
What's your take on a caller?

[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:26.340]
709 votes, you wait till Monday, man, something may or may not happen

[01:38:26.340 --> 01:38:28.400]
Would have regarded and all depends on what I feel

[01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:30.360]
A few would be okay, 322

[01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:32.120]
Not too many, a few calls

[01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:34.160]
Like maybe 4 or 5 a year

[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:34.680]
An hour

[01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:37.000]
Bring the calls back to 13

[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.540]
30% of this audience

[01:38:38.540 --> 01:38:39.580]
30, man

[01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:41.160]
Olsen, bring those bastards back

[01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:44.120]
The show is fine without the calls, only 88, 12 and a half percent

[01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:45.860]
The caller is suck, 82

[01:38:46.540 --> 01:38:49.360]
And I hate this poll out of over 700 votes still

[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:51.260]
Solimente Quattro, how do you like that?

[01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:53.800]
Only for 0.5 percent

[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:55.200]
And a number of people can relate to

[01:38:55.200 --> 01:38:56.380]
The biggest name

[01:38:56.380 --> 01:38:57.020]
A point size

[01:38:57.020 --> 01:38:57.740]
The best talent

[01:38:57.740 --> 01:38:59.620]
This is one of the law leaders

[01:38:59.620 --> 01:39:01.300]
Forced radio 560

[01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:02.760]
As you A.M

[01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:05.260]
George Bush doesn't care about black people

[01:39:06.820 --> 01:39:07.740]
Starting in two

[01:39:07.740 --> 01:39:10.080]
This is not a sports show now, so we don't give a crap

[01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:12.060]
And Yamama, how do you like that?

[01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:13.260]
So socks and hell

[01:39:13.260 --> 01:39:18.560]
Every time they see that we're lacking it's a call

[01:39:19.900 --> 01:39:21.180]
To-to-to-to

[01:39:21.740 --> 01:39:26.920]
They probably have life that will be you by the call

[01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:30.380]
Who said

[01:39:31.420 --> 01:39:32.540]
They said

[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:34.780]
Is the one

[01:39:37.460 --> 01:39:38.700]
Now they

[01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:41.140]
Have only one

[01:39:41.780 --> 01:39:42.420]
Big

[01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:46.600]
Taylor Heard

[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:48.980]
Don't point it out, she's gone

[01:39:48.980 --> 01:39:50.480]
We got it

[01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:53.040]
That way we'll put me insane

[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:54.620]
You got it

[01:39:54.620 --> 01:39:57.480]
A rally won't attack us so long

[01:39:57.480 --> 01:39:59.120]
You got it

[01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:00.600]
Where is Bush?

[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:01.880]
My kids

[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:05.880]
Mishai

[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:06.800]
Nine and eleven

[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:09.880]
Is what they got you to believe

[01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:15.000]
Can't get it in double

[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:18.040]
But a home party cut off today

[01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:21.900]
You believe

[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:24.200]
What they say

[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:26.220]
Like the call

[01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:27.400]
Like the call

[01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:28.420]
Like the call

[01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:30.300]
Like the union

[01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:32.880]
Like the union

[01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:32.900]
Like the union

[01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:34.860]
Like the call

[01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:38.020]
Like the call

[01:40:38.020 --> 01:40:39.980]
Like the election

[01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:42.460]
We got it

[01:40:42.460 --> 01:40:44.240]
Bush has got it

[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:46.580]
We got it

[01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:49.360]
Let them on your knees

[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:51.400]
We got it

[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:52.840]
Yeah

[01:40:56.680 --> 01:40:56.840]
Yeah

[01:40:57.360 --> 01:40:58.300]
We got it

[01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:01.980]
Oh

[01:41:01.980 --> 01:41:06.880]
In a place that smells just like the bad day I've been through

[01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:08.260]
It's back

[01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:11.600]
Back dressed and dragged the dream that we need to hear

[01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:15.920]
It's on a prequel circle that may be

[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:20.780]
It seems all you got to do is just ask to hear

[01:41:20.780 --> 01:41:21.180]
Yeah

[01:41:22.020 --> 01:41:25.000]
Who wives just ask to sound with the Taliban?

[01:41:26.020 --> 01:41:26.520]
Welcome

[01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:30.780]
H girls, the don't wear pants that's a Taliban now

[01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:32.920]
Tell about that

[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:34.000]
We'll take your back

[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.400]
Runs slowly but drag

[01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:37.000]
Build with smiles

[01:41:37.780 --> 01:41:40.420]
I want to say school for the world

[01:41:40.420 --> 01:41:43.100]
But we can't share our secrets

[01:41:43.780 --> 01:41:45.880]
I embrace my kids like 50 miles

[01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:47.800]
I never know when I call them down

[01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:47.800]

[01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:52.080]
Who's a fool who's thinking that it's the Taliban now

[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:56.220]
As a book writer it'll determine the Taliban

[01:41:56.220 --> 01:41:58.800]
And here's your bum

[01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:01.120]
For the Taliban in Afghanistan

[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:02.280]
And now

[01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:03.900]
Oh

[01:42:03.900 --> 01:42:04.540]
Oh

[01:42:04.540 --> 01:42:04.980]
My god

[01:42:04.980 --> 01:42:06.020]
Oh

[01:42:06.020 --> 01:42:07.200]
My god

[01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:16.960]
Well he's a Taliban Happy Night Mead

[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:19.600]
Who got the money from his daddy?

[01:42:20.500 --> 01:42:22.820]
And as I said, my little granny

[01:42:23.780 --> 01:42:26.060]
Who's in a gender that's grainy?

[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:29.160]
Oh, well he's the talent-hassy Nazi

[01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:30.960]
Double their fillet

[01:42:33.260 --> 01:42:35.440]
Well he's a presidential son

[01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:36.900]
Who doesn't have to run?

[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:38.420]
No one else is gonna win

[01:42:38.420 --> 01:42:40.280]
He might as well just move right in

[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:41.140]
SIGHIRE

[01:42:42.300 --> 01:42:42.940]
SIGHIRE

[01:42:45.140 --> 01:42:45.780]
SIGHIRE

[01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:46.000]
SIGHIRE

[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:46.740]
SIGHIRE

[01:42:46.740 --> 01:42:48.040]
He has a golden spoon

[01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:49.760]
He was born with a pizzazz

[01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:51.320]
So look out all you Jews

[01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:52.820]
Get ready for the gas

[01:42:52.820 --> 01:42:54.760]
He's the talent-hassy Nazi

[01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:55.980]
Oh, hey!

[01:42:56.060 --> 01:42:57.980]
He'll give our civil rights to Wamy

[01:42:57.980 --> 01:43:01.260]
Oh, I see the talent-hassy Nazi

[01:43:01.260 --> 01:43:03.780]
Double their fillet

[01:43:05.100 --> 01:43:07.240]
Well he's a very wealthy dude

[01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:09.000]
With very fashions to you

[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:10.440]
Who never pays his dues?

[01:43:10.660 --> 01:43:12.120]
My next year will all be screwed!

[01:43:12.780 --> 01:43:13.100]
SIGHIRE

[01:43:15.780 --> 01:43:16.340]
SIGHIRE

[01:43:17.140 --> 01:43:17.700]
SIGHIRE

[01:43:17.700 --> 01:43:17.820]
SIGHIRE

[01:43:17.820 --> 01:43:20.200]
Any smart could win that race?

[01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:21.640]
Against Buddy McKay

[01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:23.480]
Why do you think they call it Goober?

[01:43:23.700 --> 01:43:24.780]
Vitorial anyway!

[01:43:25.060 --> 01:43:26.800]
He's a talent-hassy Nazi

[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:29.920]
Oh, he'll make the KKK happy

[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:33.260]
Oh, yeah he's a talent-hassy Nazi

[01:43:33.260 --> 01:43:35.000]
Double their fillet

[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:35.300]
He'll give our civil rights to Wamy

[01:43:35.300 --> 01:43:35.300]

[01:43:36.980 --> 01:43:38.260]
Come on!

[01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:39.640]
Let's do step!

[01:43:40.420 --> 01:43:42.100]
Come on, Nino!

[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:45.640]
Let's go for it!

[01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:47.940]
Come on!

[01:43:55.260 --> 01:43:56.120]
SIGHIRE

[01:43:56.120 --> 01:43:56.120]

[01:43:56.120 --> 01:43:56.120]

[01:43:56.120 --> 01:43:59.420]
Every day's the news is morning

[01:43:59.420 --> 01:44:01.000]
We have a yellow light

[01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:03.320]
And it's that must be

[01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:05.820]
They have something to hide

[01:44:05.820 --> 01:44:09.320]
And how they manipulate their minds

[01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:11.320]
What's really heavy?

[01:44:12.540 --> 01:44:14.580]
And the kind of stuff that's used

[01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:17.740]
Like a yellow light

[01:44:17.740 --> 01:44:21.320]
Designed by the corporate media right

[01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:25.320]
And that's why we have a yellow light

[01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:33.300]
Can't explain the meaning of what needs light to do

[01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:35.140]
What needs light to do?

[01:44:35.340 --> 01:44:38.720]
She's at his desk with a set of clothes

[01:44:39.300 --> 01:44:41.460]
And noodles got through

[01:44:41.460 --> 01:44:42.740]
You got a costume

[01:44:43.300 --> 01:44:45.440]
It needs light then

[01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:46.560]
What's it to do?

[01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:49.680]
They have a yellow light

[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:51.300]
What's that name?

[01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:53.500]
Something they can't define

[01:44:53.500 --> 01:44:55.260]
I'm a white

[01:44:55.260 --> 01:44:57.300]
We have a yellow light

[01:44:58.020 --> 01:44:59.160]
A big light

[01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:01.540]
It needs light then

[01:45:01.540 --> 01:45:02.540]
What's it to do?

[01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:05.660]
They have a yellow light

[01:45:05.660 --> 01:45:07.220]
What's that name?

[01:45:07.940 --> 01:45:09.520]
Something they can define

[01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:12.620]
Hey everybody, I'm brown and brown

[01:45:13.540 --> 01:45:16.060]
Accountable for everybody, brown and brown

[01:45:16.060 --> 01:45:17.580]
That's a human being

[01:45:17.580 --> 01:45:19.260]
I'm a big disappointment

[01:45:19.260 --> 01:45:21.060]
But I got a brown nose

[01:45:21.060 --> 01:45:22.780]
And I know it's where I pointed

[01:45:22.780 --> 01:45:26.020]
There was no rush to get them saved

[01:45:26.020 --> 01:45:27.540]
They don't vote Republican

[01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:30.820]
And anyway, I did everything

[01:45:30.820 --> 01:45:32.760]
I possibly can

[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:34.180]
They sure am I support

[01:45:34.820 --> 01:45:36.000]
For the club's plans

[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000]
Oh what a job I had

[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.340]
And the director of FIFA

[01:45:39.340 --> 01:45:42.980]
When I ain't much more than a weasel and skimmer

[01:45:42.980 --> 01:45:45.540]
And a clueless son of a bitch

[01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:49.580]
Get your skigs, brown nose and the ridge

[01:45:49.580 --> 01:45:52.880]
Get your skigs, brown nose and the ridge

[01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:56.220]
You all means as wiped out and gone

[01:45:56.820 --> 01:45:59.540]
But double you said I did one heck of a job

[01:45:59.540 --> 01:46:01.420]
And it sure pays off

[01:46:01.420 --> 01:46:04.900]
To be a crowning and another white maize

[01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:07.940]
The Christian, Bonnie, the National Guard

[01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:09.820]
Is down there now

[01:46:09.820 --> 01:46:13.000]
We thought it's just to get the press out of town

[01:46:13.540 --> 01:46:14.840]
Everybody go home

[01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:16.340]
There's nothing to see

[01:46:16.340 --> 01:46:19.900]
Everything here is pretty cheek-cane

[01:46:19.900 --> 01:46:23.240]
Over hurricane gave us the big easy

[01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:26.180]
For deal-con social engineering

[01:46:26.180 --> 01:46:29.680]
Like a giant raid public in Swain-Chain

[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:33.160]
Praise Jesus for our Lord and King

[01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:36.180]
Praise Jesus for our Lord and King

[01:46:36.740 --> 01:46:38.800]
I don't believe in compassion

[01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:39.740]
What we lack

[01:46:39.740 --> 01:46:41.500]
It serves the right

[01:46:41.500 --> 01:46:44.360]
To have less blacks and you dissenters

[01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:46.580]
Who say it's a national disgrace

[01:46:46.580 --> 01:46:48.400]
They shouldn't have it black

[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:50.220]
In the first place

[01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:52.140]
This is no time to blame

[01:46:52.140 --> 01:46:53.300]
The blame game

[01:46:53.300 --> 01:46:56.660]
Since we know that furry kings are called by kings

[01:46:56.660 --> 01:46:59.300]
Who are not the right gunna all-monger

[01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:03.280]
Like Scotty McLean and Carl Rowe

[01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:04.660]
All we're achieving here

[01:47:04.660 --> 01:47:06.680]
A Marriot-Kiss-Rite-Wing Dream

[01:47:07.300 --> 01:47:10.100]
To make everybody white like me

[01:47:10.100 --> 01:47:13.300]
And an ignorant son of a bitch

[01:47:13.300 --> 01:47:16.660]
Who gets his job, brown nose and the ridge

[01:47:16.660 --> 01:47:18.880]
Oh, how I miss getting behind you

[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:20.200]
Maybe in horses

[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:23.600]
I'd rather do that than watch floating corpses

[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:26.180]
On the negligent vertebrae now

[01:47:26.780 --> 01:47:28.540]
And I'll keep going down

[01:47:28.540 --> 01:47:30.200]
And keep my nose brown

[01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:32.840]
On the negligent vertebrae now

[01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:35.240]
But I'll keep going down

[01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:36.960]
To keep my nose brown

[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:38.200]
Heck of a job, brownie

[01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:40.440]
Okay, a couple of quick stories here

[01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:41.960]
To interspers before we do anything else

[01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:44.020]
I don't want to interrupt the flow of this, but nevertheless

[01:47:44.020 --> 01:47:44.640]
Yeah, what the hell?

[01:47:44.940 --> 01:47:47.440]
The sixth floor of the Mimehealed newspaper building

[01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:51.860]
Has been evacuated after a man identified as a former cartoonist for El Nuevo

[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:53.080]
Newsroom

[01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:55.400]
El Nuevo Herald

[01:47:55.400 --> 01:47:56.980]
Enter the newsroom with a gun

[01:47:58.540 --> 01:47:59.420]
Like that

[01:47:59.420 --> 01:48:02.880]
Maybe it's going to be black and red Friday

[01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:06.220]
Are we sure hope now? We know my innocent bystanders getting shot up there, do we?

[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:07.620]
Well, it all depends on who they are

[01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:09.900]
And speaking of violence and bloodshed

[01:48:09.900 --> 01:48:14.380]
Malisha men grabbed six sunnies as they left Friday worship services to the in Baghdad

[01:48:14.380 --> 01:48:16.840]
Now it's them with kerosene and burn them alive

[01:48:17.900 --> 01:48:19.600]
As the raki soldiers stood by

[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:25.700]
And seven suny mosques came under attack and she had stuck revenge for the slaughter of at least 215 people in the Saudi city

[01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:26.300]
So I'm here today

[01:48:26.300 --> 01:48:30.420]
A US helicopter will fire in the Shi'idon clave after militiamen fired on her from the ground

[01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:32.480]
There were no media reports of casualties

[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:35.160]
It's a picnic over there, maybe you bring the ants

[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:37.860]
The biggest names of best talents

[01:48:37.860 --> 01:48:38.400]
The biggest names of best talents

[01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:39.480]
This is Neil Rogers

[01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:41.380]
Force Radio 560

[01:48:43.140 --> 01:48:43.500]
1232

[01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:45.340]
Here's a little bit more on that thing at the herald

[01:48:45.340 --> 01:48:46.460]
One little more? Please

[01:48:46.460 --> 01:48:47.560]
Not too much

[01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:51.220]
Mime and police have begun evacuating the six floor of the herald building

[01:48:51.220 --> 01:48:54.720]
After a man claiming to be armed walking into the six floor newsroom according to police

[01:48:55.340 --> 01:48:57.320]
What does that have to do with sports? Oh good point

[01:48:57.320 --> 01:48:59.700]
How'd you like that rejoin? We had an last break by the way

[01:49:00.340 --> 01:49:05.660]
Well, you can hear more about Larry Coker getting fired at two when we start talking important stuff sports on QAM

[01:49:05.660 --> 01:49:06.740]
Yes, screw you guys

[01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:11.820]
Anyway, employees identified the man is the only waybo hero cartoonist Jose Varela

[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:15.400]
Why sure? Hope he's not kind to alien every rally, you know her?

[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:16.120]
I do

[01:49:16.900 --> 01:49:23.100]
They said for a vanilla Varela appeared agitated demanded to see on waybo hero's executive editor Omberto Castello

[01:49:23.100 --> 01:49:25.680]
He appeared to be armed with a handgun employee said

[01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:29.980]
And the waybo hero Harold is a Spanish language newspaper published by the herald media company

[01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:31.580]
And that nobody speaks English wants

[01:49:31.580 --> 01:49:33.800]
I thought it was a joke when employees said

[01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:34.720]
Yes, some joke

[01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:41.420]
Another employee said Varela walked in started talking to employees then he began ordering women out for their own security the employee said

[01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:48.380]
About 12 to 15 workers inside the newsroom were present employees said on the waybo hero's employees have been instructed not to talk to other reporters

[01:49:48.380 --> 01:49:50.220]
Keep mum, you know what I'm saying?

[01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:55.780]
In any language the man's motives are unclear police said he just pissed off because your people get very emotional

[01:49:55.780 --> 01:49:58.220]
Miguel that we do not blooded an emotional

[01:49:58.220 --> 01:50:05.340]
Miami police asked their counterparts at the date county police department to dispatch marine patrol units to gain security of the herald's waterfront

And calling minds want to know

[01:50:15.100 --> 01:50:17.480]
That's why inquiring minds read the Miami hero

[01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:20.820]
Is Maurice Fere really having sex with an alien from outer space?

[01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:21.640]

Our own Pulitzer prize is just for us

UAiseigninel mail, quote-unv

[01:51:12.940 --> 01:51:17.460]
These are football they do, inside the wall of meat

[01:51:17.460 --> 01:51:22.080]
The kind of guy that I want to do, let's do this to keep.

[01:51:23.320 --> 01:51:27.040]
I want to hit, he'll go on a date, but there's no chance at all.

[01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:31.860]
So does the make me a sports queer, if I want to see him grab the ball?

[01:51:32.120 --> 01:51:32.480]
Absolutely.

[01:51:32.820 --> 01:51:34.080]
Oh baby wow!

[01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:40.860]
Look at that kid, he'll wait to see no man quite like gravy with.

La la la la la la la la la la la la la.

[01:51:46.520 --> 01:51:50.480]
I gotta hide every discreet that helps me see his moments.

[01:51:51.740 --> 01:51:55.340]
I can't do what I want, but I ain't gonna ever get none.

[01:51:56.360 --> 01:51:59.860]
No need to age up a vision school, okay, that's not so great.

[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:04.520]
But I'm just gonna go to the maddening, at least until he's 28.

[01:52:05.540 --> 01:52:06.940]
So I'm gravy, he's out.

My lawyer says it's worth quite well for some.

[01:52:55.760 --> 01:52:56.560]
I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man.

[01:52:56.560 --> 01:52:56.560]

[01:52:56.560 --> 01:52:57.540]
I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man.

[01:52:57.760 --> 01:53:04.640]
I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man.

[01:53:08.740 --> 01:53:10.200]
I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man.

[01:53:31.160 --> 01:53:34.040]
I'm not a man, I'm not a man.

[01:53:34.100 --> 01:53:38.460]
He's the God of life.

[01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:38.600]
He's the God of life.

[01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:40.180]
He's the God of life.

[01:53:40.180 --> 01:53:41.200]
I'm glad

[01:53:46.180 --> 01:53:48.820]
Glaming on my child

[01:53:48.820 --> 01:53:58.020]
The daughter of those toys that I never had

[01:53:58.020 --> 01:54:02.320]
The only geochrome in my life

[01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:06.760]
What my child and I feel still died

[01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:15.320]
Before you judge me

[01:54:16.260 --> 01:54:19.100]
And call me freaking

[01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:25.940]
Let me find and thought and say

[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:38.560]
I believe it on my child

[01:54:45.820 --> 01:54:49.640]
Yellow might originally try to make a big yellow

[01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:51.280]
Hello

[01:54:52.840 --> 01:54:54.860]
Hello, in a perfect

[01:54:55.880 --> 01:54:58.120]
What the hell's the matter, honey?

[01:54:58.120 --> 01:54:59.800]
I'm getting up

[01:54:59.800 --> 01:55:01.300]
Are you crying?

[01:55:01.880 --> 01:55:03.900]
You sound like you're crying

[01:55:03.900 --> 01:55:06.100]
I'm getting up by aliens

[01:55:06.100 --> 01:55:07.980]
You've been getting up again?

[01:55:08.500 --> 01:55:10.080]
By aliens

[01:55:11.060 --> 01:55:13.320]
You've been getting up by aliens?

[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:15.960]
Where they done took you?

[01:55:17.940 --> 01:55:18.800]
Albuquerque

[01:55:20.660 --> 01:55:21.520]
Albuquerque?

[01:55:21.580 --> 01:55:23.260]
Is that an America?

[01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:25.280]
Where is it?

[01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:25.840]
In New Mexico

[01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:29.020]
Albuquerque is

[01:55:29.020 --> 01:55:30.240]
Yeah, I was in Georgia

[01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:31.260]
No, no, no, Mexico

[01:55:31.260 --> 01:55:35.300]
I don't believe you, honey

[01:55:35.300 --> 01:55:36.860]
You don't have to lie to me

[01:55:36.860 --> 01:55:38.540]
No, I want to get married

[01:55:38.540 --> 01:55:40.900]
I really do it just that I was kidnapped by aliens

[01:55:40.900 --> 01:55:42.480]
I'll have to leave you, honey

[01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:43.740]
They got short hair

[01:55:45.300 --> 01:55:46.260]
Who does?

[01:55:46.700 --> 01:55:48.220]
The aliens have short hair

[01:55:48.220 --> 01:55:50.940]
You say short hair, you mean like Ryan C. Chris Short

[01:55:50.940 --> 01:55:52.540]
A little longer than that

[02:03:17.900 --> 02:03:19.880]
With a cigarette and a shark neck

[02:03:19.880 --> 02:03:22.320]

The edge of the rock, it's easy

[02:03:23.960 --> 02:03:24.440]
Ow!

[02:03:32.120 --> 02:03:34.400]
The temperature is zero

[02:03:37.780 --> 02:03:42.440]
It is cold, it is so freaking cold

[02:03:44.260 --> 02:03:48.640]
And I cringe every time the wind blows

[02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:55.520]
In my pants, something is shrinking

[02:03:56.880 --> 02:04:01.720]
I'm so cold I can't lip-sync

[02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:07.920]
That's because it's zero baby

[02:04:10.420 --> 02:04:14.700]
And I cannot feel my thoughts

[02:04:17.320 --> 02:04:21.100]
There's a tingling in my fingers

[02:04:22.760 --> 02:04:28.100]
And my pride that puts a force

[02:04:28.100 --> 02:04:36.680]
Oh, my nose is about to fall

[02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:43.180]
There's a cloud every time that I call

[02:04:44.180 --> 02:04:46.260]
And my hands are blue

[02:04:47.180 --> 02:04:49.560]
They are turning on

[02:04:51.180 --> 02:04:56.340]
They might have cuties, my thoughts

[02:04:58.800 --> 02:05:02.340]
That's because it's zero baby

[02:05:04.960 --> 02:05:08.740]
I can barely move my mouth

[02:05:08.740 --> 02:05:10.180]
Oh, no

[02:05:11.560 --> 02:05:15.000]
I'm a red hat like tin lava

[02:05:17.180 --> 02:05:22.460]
But first I need to be gone out

[02:05:23.180 --> 02:05:29.220]
Yes, I need to be gone out

[02:05:30.180 --> 02:05:34.680]
That's because it's zero

[02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:37.360]
That's it for you

[02:05:40.220 --> 02:05:41.500]
Yes and high

[02:05:42.680 --> 02:05:44.800]

[02:05:45.860 --> 02:05:49.380]
And cover it in sweet rain egg and egg

[02:05:49.380 --> 02:05:51.040]
Rain egg and egg

[02:05:51.040 --> 02:05:59.640]
Rain egg and egg because he wants to make new or leaves peace

[02:05:59.640 --> 02:06:02.300]
And I don't care what people are saying

[02:06:02.300 --> 02:06:03.800]
It's like Jesse Jackson

[02:06:03.800 --> 02:06:05.440]
We as black people

[02:06:05.440 --> 02:06:06.960]
His comments are bizarre

[02:06:06.960 --> 02:06:09.060]
Surely God is man

[02:06:09.060 --> 02:06:12.140]
He compares the vocals to a willy wank upon

[02:06:12.140 --> 02:06:14.160]
Chocolate egg and egg

[02:06:15.240 --> 02:06:17.000]
Yes, right now he can

[02:06:18.900 --> 02:06:23.960]
Rain egg and egg because he wants to make new or leaves peace

[02:06:26.080 --> 02:06:28.540]
It's time for us to come together

[02:06:28.540 --> 02:06:32.240]
It's time for us to rebuild a New Orleans

[02:06:32.240 --> 02:06:33.680]
The one that should be

[02:06:34.540 --> 02:06:37.120]
Uptown or wherever they are

[02:06:37.120 --> 02:06:39.780]
This city will be chocolate

[02:06:40.540 --> 02:06:41.740]
A chocolate nuance

[02:06:41.740 --> 02:06:43.780]
He never takes the blame

[02:06:45.140 --> 02:06:47.020]
For anything he says

[02:06:47.540 --> 02:06:48.940]
Chocolate at the end of the day

[02:06:48.940 --> 02:06:50.540]
With that chocolate in some coffee

[02:06:50.540 --> 02:06:52.460]
And a cup of warm ballads

[02:06:52.460 --> 02:06:53.620]
Rain egg and egg

[02:06:55.520 --> 02:06:57.480]
Rain egg and egg

[02:06:59.340 --> 02:07:00.920]
Rain egg and egg

[02:07:00.920 --> 02:07:01.300]
Rain egg and egg

[02:07:01.300 --> 02:07:04.020]
Because he wants to make new or leaves peace

[02:07:04.020 --> 02:07:07.740]
You can't have New Orleans no other way

[02:07:08.480 --> 02:07:09.680]
It wasn't in the war

[02:07:10.600 --> 02:07:13.100]
The biggest name, the best talent

[02:07:13.100 --> 02:07:14.760]
This is Neil Rogers

[02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:16.700]
Forged Radio 560

[02:07:16.700 --> 02:07:19.420]
I just prayed to Quinn

[02:07:19.420 --> 02:07:21.680]
I like to shave my legs, arms and buns

[02:07:21.680 --> 02:07:23.420]
While listening to the Neil Rogers

[02:07:23.420 --> 02:07:24.520]
One to two hours

[02:07:25.520 --> 02:07:29.440]
I got a call here, the number one rated the Moe Highland in David and his home

[02:07:29.440 --> 02:07:31.660]
At least according to my aspirations

[02:07:32.240 --> 02:07:33.340]
Stay away from it

[02:07:33.340 --> 02:07:34.880]
I don't even know how you have children

[02:07:35.520 --> 02:07:36.040]
Mirabah, hello

[02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:38.880]
Yes, I want to take on J. Feeder

[02:07:38.880 --> 02:07:43.240]
Oh, J. Feeder is a great quarterback and a good joke

[02:07:43.240 --> 02:07:45.020]
I like J. Feeder

[02:07:45.020 --> 02:07:50.320]
Well, not to mention he's got extraordinary, never-least smooth but pops

[02:07:50.320 --> 02:07:51.440]
Oh, yeah

[02:07:51.440 --> 02:07:53.160]
David, you gotta be careful what you say here

[02:07:53.160 --> 02:07:54.760]
Oh, kicked up, thank you more

[02:07:54.760 --> 02:07:56.220]
No, no, wait a minute, it's all go

[02:07:56.220 --> 02:07:58.700]
But I have nothing else to say

[02:07:58.700 --> 02:07:59.900]
How about this?

[02:08:00.140 --> 02:08:01.740]
I was the weather down there in Mirabah

[02:08:01.740 --> 02:08:03.600]
I'm right down the street from you

[02:08:03.600 --> 02:08:05.160]
I have to go

[02:08:05.160 --> 02:08:06.360]
Oh, wait, by the way, something

[02:08:06.360 --> 02:08:08.760]
No, no, I have to go

[02:08:08.760 --> 02:08:11.420]
Look, I tell you what, I'll hold you open up break, how's that?

[02:08:11.860 --> 02:08:14.640]
I'll give you one of my old Tantatians, how's that?

[02:08:15.440 --> 02:08:16.540]
No way, too

[02:08:17.160 --> 02:08:18.540]
That was the only caller we had

[02:08:18.540 --> 02:08:21.320]
The failing time in New Orleans is blowing again

[02:08:21.320 --> 02:08:22.780]
No, no, no, no, no

[02:08:23.320 --> 02:08:30.440]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[02:08:31.320 --> 02:08:35.600]
Wow! You got things with you, things

[02:08:36.320 --> 02:08:38.940]
On your nose and on your face

[02:08:38.940 --> 02:08:42.940]
And around those losing pimples

[02:08:42.940 --> 02:08:45.180]
You blow my eyes out

[02:08:45.180 --> 02:08:53.800]
If you go look in the mirror you'll be a road not for Yips of empty

[02:08:53.800 --> 02:09:00.720]
You're just your happy son, way too shy, shy, shy, wow, wow

[02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:07.360]
My nose glows when something stays, almost every day I think

[02:09:07.360 --> 02:09:11.000]
And my veins suddenly start to tickle

[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.660]
I had to noise, did it torture, torture, torture

[02:09:14.660 --> 02:09:18.740]
Yeah, I'd fall, like a drop falling apart

[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.320]
Can't for cause I'm a criminal, fine

[02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:27.400]
But when I know it's next to, it's my full face

[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:31.020]
Yeah, it's my full face

[02:09:31.020 --> 02:09:33.080]
I've been glad to watch the screen

[02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:38.000]
And science cannot establish a reason

[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:46.800]
I would have a reason, I would fall, like a drop falling apart

[02:09:46.800 --> 02:09:48.080]
I would have a reason, I would fall, like a drop falling apart

[02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:51.160]
Try not to sink out, I would have a reason

[02:09:51.160 --> 02:09:52.780]
I'm just lying

[02:09:55.320 --> 02:09:57.440]
I just know how it ended today

[02:09:57.440 --> 02:10:00.360]
We're gonna have a little union here, Gelde and I

[02:10:01.100 --> 02:10:04.780]
Weans they had the little problem with the starting show feed, did it?

[02:10:04.780 --> 02:10:07.380]
I think that this satellite fell down as something

[02:10:07.380 --> 02:10:09.000]
Yeah, like your butt

[02:10:09.960 --> 02:10:14.460]
Why I'll have you know my butt ducks are the lightfully fine, thank you very much

[02:10:14.460 --> 02:10:18.420]
Now if they don't mind, let's repaint in a sanctity of sports

[02:10:18.420 --> 02:10:20.300]
How about a little touchy feeling?

[02:10:20.540 --> 02:10:21.500]
Now see here

[02:10:21.500 --> 02:10:22.100]
Beware

[02:10:22.100 --> 02:10:22.780]
Over here

[02:10:22.780 --> 02:10:24.140]
Now see here

[02:10:24.140 --> 02:10:24.800]
What, you hear?

[02:10:25.140 --> 02:10:26.520]
What a sucker

[02:10:26.520 --> 02:10:28.140]
Yeah, so stupid

[02:10:28.780 --> 02:10:30.780]
I am so stupid like they say

[02:10:30.780 --> 02:10:33.660]
I'm the official voice of the pants

[02:10:35.160 --> 02:10:36.200]
Take deal

[02:10:36.200 --> 02:10:40.660]
Why I'll have you know I made my bones when you were in embryo

[02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:42.540]
How do you know?

[02:10:42.600 --> 02:10:44.880]
Well, there's something I never told you

[02:10:44.880 --> 02:10:45.280]
Yeah

[02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:47.740]
I'm your father

[02:10:47.740 --> 02:10:48.580]
Daddy

[02:10:48.580 --> 02:10:49.440]
Son

[02:10:52.200 --> 02:10:53.660]
I'm an embryo

[02:10:56.040 --> 02:10:57.900]
I just don't have an egg

[02:10:57.900 --> 02:10:59.880]
That was wild

[02:10:59.880 --> 02:10:59.880]

[02:11:01.620 --> 02:11:02.900]
Hey, what do you think?

[02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:05.520]
Hey, you're so stupid

[02:11:06.500 --> 02:11:07.600]
I'm not scared

[02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:09.000]
I'm just kidding

[02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:09.000]

[02:11:11.720 --> 02:11:13.480]
I'm not scared

[02:11:14.500 --> 02:11:15.260]
I'm not scared

[02:11:15.260 --> 02:11:16.720]
I'm not scared

[02:11:17.500 --> 02:11:18.560]
I'm not scared

[02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:19.820]
I'm not scared

[02:11:19.820 --> 02:11:20.820]
Yeah!

[02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:21.920]
Yeah!

[02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:22.640]
Yeah!

[02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:24.100]
What's the next time?

[02:11:26.020 --> 02:11:26.200]
What?

[02:11:26.820 --> 02:11:28.040]
That's the time!

[02:11:28.960 --> 02:11:29.320]
What's the next time?

[02:11:29.540 --> 02:11:29.740]
Yeah!

[02:11:30.440 --> 02:11:32.020]
You have to get that!

[02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:32.940]
What?

[02:11:35.140 --> 02:11:35.780]
What?

[02:11:35.960 --> 02:11:36.160]
What?

[02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:36.200]

[02:11:36.580 --> 02:11:36.580]

[02:11:37.540 --> 02:11:38.620]
Get out of that!

[02:11:38.860 --> 02:11:39.260]
What?

[02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:41.220]
Get out of that!

[02:11:41.220 --> 02:11:41.700]
Get out of that!

[02:11:42.220 --> 02:11:43.080]
Get out of that!

[02:11:43.080 --> 02:11:43.480]
Get out of that!

[02:11:43.500 --> 02:11:44.360]
Get out of that!

[02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:46.700]
Get out of that!

[02:11:46.700 --> 02:11:48.240]
Get out of that!

[02:11:48.700 --> 02:11:48.960]
Get out of that!

[02:11:48.960 --> 02:11:49.620]
Get out of that!

[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:52.600]
Get out of that!

[02:11:52.600 --> 02:11:52.820]
Get out of that!

[02:11:53.220 --> 02:11:54.180]
Get out of it!

[02:11:54.240 --> 02:11:54.240]

[02:11:54.240 --> 02:11:55.720]
Get out of that!

[02:11:56.600 --> 02:11:57.820]
Get out of that!

[02:11:57.820 --> 02:11:58.020]
Yeah!

[02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:03.880]
No no no no tastes...

[02:12:03.880 --> 02:12:04.880]
Let me even throw this away...

[02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:05.380]
Ohhh!

[02:12:05.380 --> 02:12:05.380]

[02:12:05.380 --> 02:12:05.440]
Oh yeah!

[02:12:06.380 --> 02:12:07.800]
Of course you'll get to extinguish it!

[02:12:07.800 --> 02:12:08.680]
Brent, just tell me not to tighten it up!

[02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:09.380]
What the fuck!

[02:12:09.720 --> 02:12:10.140]
Yeah!

[02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:13.660]
Absolutelyaler I think.

[02:12:13.860 --> 02:12:15.500]
Oooh, what he at least?

[02:12:15.500 --> 02:12:17.460]
I can get a little piece of quiet.

[02:12:18.540 --> 02:12:19.480]
I am all.

[02:12:20.180 --> 02:12:21.440]
What are you doing here, not all?

[02:12:21.640 --> 02:12:24.120]
When I wait in my hair, I pull my oven,

[02:12:24.420 --> 02:12:27.080]
dressed up like honey, steam, and that's for you.

[02:12:27.300 --> 02:12:29.040]
Failure. You're forcing me to do this.

[02:12:29.380 --> 02:12:31.300]
Hey, how about a nice Hawaiian punch?

[02:12:31.780 --> 02:12:32.120]
Sure.

[02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:33.360]

[02:12:35.100 --> 02:12:35.820]
Oh, no.

[02:12:35.820 --> 02:12:37.260]
Oh, no, no.

[02:12:40.620 --> 02:12:42.840]
Oh, no, no.

[02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:45.540]
Oh, no, no.

[02:12:45.740 --> 02:12:46.640]
Oh, no, no.

[02:12:46.640 --> 02:12:46.940]
Oh, no, no.

[02:12:46.940 --> 02:12:47.360]
Oh, no, no.

[02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:50.760]
Oh, no, no.

[02:12:50.760 --> 02:12:50.960]
Oh, no, no, no.

[02:12:52.280 --> 02:12:53.720]
Oh, no, no.

[02:12:53.940 --> 02:12:54.600]
Oh, no, no.

[02:12:54.600 --> 02:12:55.760]
Oh, no, no.

[02:12:56.040 --> 02:12:58.320]
Oh, no, no.

[02:12:59.960 --> 02:13:01.760]
Oh, no, no.

[02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:02.940]
Oh, no, no.

[02:13:03.760 --> 02:13:06.260]
Oh, no, no, no.

[02:13:06.600 --> 02:13:07.820]
Oh, no, no.

[02:13:07.940 --> 02:13:11.120]
Oh, no, no.

[02:13:11.900 --> 02:13:13.200]
Oh, no, no, no.

[02:13:13.500 --> 02:13:15.140]
Oh, no, no, no.

[02:13:15.140 --> 02:13:16.020]
Oh, no, no.

[02:13:16.240 --> 02:13:17.520]
Oh, no, no.

[02:13:17.900 --> 02:13:18.420]
Oh, no, no.

[02:13:18.420 --> 02:13:19.300]
Oh, no.

[02:13:19.300 --> 02:13:21.660]
Oh, no, no.

[02:13:21.720 --> 02:13:25.520]
Oh, no, no.

[02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:28.680]
Oh, no, no.

[02:13:29.500 --> 02:13:29.500]

[02:13:36.020 --> 02:13:36.780]
Hey, Farah!

[02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:39.580]
By the way, sir, I've been given it some stuff.

[02:13:40.300 --> 02:13:42.080]
Oh, what do you think it is?

[02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:49.200]
I know that me and you can do much better to go in sixth to tenth and not in five.

[02:13:49.720 --> 02:13:51.500]
A Gentile in the cranky too.

[02:13:52.040 --> 02:13:55.420]
I think we might be happy to get there.

[02:13:57.280 --> 02:14:00.780]
I think you really got out of your mind.

[02:14:01.300 --> 02:14:04.600]
You got to have your weary bag, stand on to tight.

[02:14:05.020 --> 02:14:06.860]
No chance I'll do a show with you.

[02:14:07.380 --> 02:14:10.340]
I'd rather die with the crappy together.

[02:14:13.060 --> 02:14:19.960]
Why I'll help you know that I'm a big, ma big Jew, from Brooklyn Heights.

[02:14:21.140 --> 02:14:25.180]
I've been rigged and I have buried my Jew.

[02:14:25.820 --> 02:14:27.400]
You're not tight tight.

[02:14:28.540 --> 02:14:31.040]
We involved in that with love.

[02:14:31.460 --> 02:14:34.900]
No way that if we had a fight, that you'd survive.

[02:14:35.380 --> 02:14:37.160]
Who'd wanna hear a Gentile?

[02:14:37.800 --> 02:14:40.460]
And push it tight, that's crappy together.

[02:14:40.460 --> 02:14:41.020]

And what do you think it is?

[02:14:59.940 --> 02:15:05.700]

I know what I'm talking about.

[02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.460]
Every morning at the condo, I take the elevator down,

[02:16:15.660 --> 02:16:18.320]
and on my way to the car when I pull my clothing basket out,

[02:16:18.580 --> 02:16:20.160]
I give a free condo paper.

[02:16:21.260 --> 02:16:22.980]
The door is a back and pound.

[02:16:24.360 --> 02:16:27.340]
The door is a back and pound.

[02:16:27.340 --> 02:16:29.020]

The door is a back and pound.

[02:16:48.940 --> 02:16:50.920]
I said the door is a back and pound.

[02:16:51.520 --> 02:16:52.480]
Why you lose?

[02:16:53.740 --> 02:16:56.420]
Ah, my car, a long use for all books.

[02:16:57.180 --> 02:16:58.820]
I know I've been taking a toll on a tattoo,

[02:16:58.820 --> 02:17:02.280]
but I know all the new Maja rules.

[02:17:02.700 --> 02:17:04.680]

the

[02:19:11.460 --> 02:19:13.680]
this

[02:19:13.680 --> 02:19:20.100]
with a bridge

[02:19:21.720 --> 02:19:21.720]

[02:19:21.720 --> 02:19:26.240]
Access with a path so the deal here is is that basically if you're an employee

[02:19:26.240 --> 02:19:30.820]
The deal is they don't know what what tells going on. There's nothing new if you've been sleeping or like

[02:19:31.280 --> 02:19:37.000]
Black Friday and or whatever you've been doing a former employee of the Eleno way boy Harold the Harold Spanish language

[02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:43.520]
They lose papers inside one hero plans of building in downtown Miami with a machine gun man. I sure it's not a good machine

[02:19:44.620 --> 02:19:47.980]
The former employee identified as Jose Verrella former cartoonist

[02:19:47.980 --> 02:19:52.620]
It said to be on the sixth floor where the newspapers produced as of noon the entire floor was evacuated

[02:19:53.200 --> 02:19:57.160]
Verrella was reported to be inside on Berrito Castello Castello's office

[02:19:57.160 --> 02:20:02.620]
Castello's executive editor of the Spanish newspaper. I'll Harold Verrella was reportedly fired last February

[02:20:02.620 --> 02:20:06.380]
Maybe he's got a fire. Let's hope not. He's got a machine gun man

[02:20:06.380 --> 02:20:11.420]
Police have a surround with the building and CNN's all over this like I said like stink on clearance. That's February

[02:20:11.420 --> 02:20:13.280]
I beg your pardon last February

[02:20:14.600 --> 02:20:20.760]
He got canned while it says was be poorly fired last February while he's a slow burn. Yeah, seriously

[02:20:22.180 --> 02:20:26.380]
Or maybe he's just there to make a statement, you know who the hell knows what's going on? It's your people

[02:20:27.780 --> 02:20:33.940]
772 votes will be surpassed to 750 that I was going at very modestly today because I don't want to fall short, you know wouldn't be the first time

[02:20:35.440 --> 02:20:40.000]
772 Miguel said we're gonna go for 800 votes today. I think we can do it. We got a real shot. Oh, that's a bad

[02:20:42.240 --> 02:20:45.660]
What's your take on the callers a few would be okay 350

[02:20:46.800 --> 02:20:53.400]
Bring the calls back with an exclamation point 231 you maniac you look at it. I'll tell you it's so much easier for me, you know

[02:20:54.880 --> 02:20:57.220]
And I'm as easy as today, but it's pretty easy

[02:20:57.220 --> 02:21:01.520]
The show is fine without the calls only 95 a mere 12.2%

[02:21:02.200 --> 02:21:08.680]
The caller suck 92 that's another 12% and I hate this pool. What do you think that is what you're probably looking at it?

[02:21:08.680 --> 02:21:15.960]
No still the same for out of 774 votes still the same for 0.5%

[02:21:17.320 --> 02:21:19.860]
Is that impressive or what bear me while CNN

[02:21:21.940 --> 02:21:28.320]
But they're all set up all the cameras are outside they are herald Plaza and they're all whipped up into a frenzy and nobody knows a damn thing

[02:21:28.320 --> 02:21:34.600]

Freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom's dead, freedom

[02:29:36.540 --> 02:29:46.980]
The world has to evolve and�and you'll deserve it You got the power hour with the Humper Soto log guest and then Hank five to seven Panther preview at seven o'clock and the Panthers against what it says in the schedule, The Washington Senator

[02:29:48.400 --> 02:29:55.240]
at seven thirty you better brush-up on your hockey Mr. Clarence because you wouldn't know the senators from your ass, end of the K, after the hockey game

[02:29:55.240 --> 02:30:01.400]
It's the crappin'als Mr. and if anybody don't know about the crappin'als, it's you Clarence because crap is your middle name

[02:30:01.400 --> 02:30:04.760]
It's Friday you best, dads

[02:30:04.760 --> 02:30:10.420]
It's late at night, you're fast asleep and a shadowy figure is about to break into your home.

[02:30:10.760 --> 02:30:12.260]
But you're protected!

[02:30:14.360 --> 02:30:18.240]
Yes, it's the James Brown Home Security Law!

[02:30:20.760 --> 02:30:23.280]
The heart is working along in the safety business.

[02:30:27.740 --> 02:30:30.860]
Designed by the Godfather of Home Protection himself.

[02:30:32.380 --> 02:30:38.360]
The James Brown Law protects you from burglar, vandals, peep and talk.

[02:30:38.840 --> 02:30:42.120]
And if you act now, we'll include it no extra cost.

[02:30:42.480 --> 02:30:45.640]
The fattened James Brown hot pants, far along.

[02:30:47.100 --> 02:30:50.940]
So put the sole patrol on your keyhole.

[02:30:51.880 --> 02:30:55.120]
With the James Brown Home Security System.

[02:30:56.940 --> 02:30:58.920]
You'll say, I'm being good!

[02:31:00.940 --> 02:31:05.360]
Have you ever turned on the radio and said, that song makes me sick.

[02:31:05.780 --> 02:31:11.440]
Well now, KO Pack Take Records presents, songs that make you wanna throw up.

[02:31:20.560 --> 02:31:24.860]
Yes, on songs that make you wanna throw up, you get sting.

[02:31:24.860 --> 02:31:29.800]
If I ever lose my love, I'll lose my love.

[02:31:29.800 --> 02:31:33.500]
Like a complete barper on a, and who could forget their classic?

[02:31:33.720 --> 02:31:44.560]
Puk, puk, puk, puk, puk, and ho, puk, puk, puk, puk, and ho, puk, puk, puk, puk, and ho, puk, puk, puk, puk, puk, you know you make me wanna bar.

[02:31:44.800 --> 02:31:54.480]
My nose reaps, I roll my child now, I hop my cookies, I hop my new devour, you don't even know how to do it.

[02:31:54.480 --> 02:31:56.780]
Songs that make you wanna throw up.

[02:32:02.780 --> 02:32:08.700]
I thought Christie and the tea was fairy tale.

[02:32:09.200 --> 02:32:09.780]
Absolute.

[02:32:10.320 --> 02:32:13.740]
This religious thing was not for me.

[02:32:15.500 --> 02:32:18.220]
They held a big convention.

[02:32:19.440 --> 02:32:21.220]
They let me in for free.

[02:32:22.040 --> 02:32:26.880]
I had no idea what I was about to see.

[02:32:26.980 --> 02:32:31.920]
They were speaking in tongues, that made me a believer.

[02:32:33.120 --> 02:32:34.840]
Was kind of fun.

[02:32:35.760 --> 02:32:38.040]
They just stick it out of high ground.

[02:32:39.640 --> 02:32:40.920]
Speaking tongue.

[02:32:42.500 --> 02:32:47.060]
They got me believe in my talking wings, and from side to side.

[02:32:51.220 --> 02:32:51.220]

[02:33:01.060 --> 02:33:04.260]
The Lord will now embrace me.

[02:33:04.740 --> 02:33:06.860]
I flat my tongue to the feet.

[02:33:07.260 --> 02:33:07.480]
Babb.

[02:33:08.220 --> 02:33:11.600]
Now whatever I do, he'll forgive me.

[02:33:12.560 --> 02:33:14.320]
Oh, was now I speak in tongue.

[02:33:15.260 --> 02:33:17.620]
But that makes me a believer.

[02:33:17.620 --> 02:33:19.340]
La, la, la, la, la, la.

[02:33:19.340 --> 02:33:20.440]
And I'm having fun.

[02:33:20.820 --> 02:33:22.220]
La, la, la, la, la, la.

[02:33:22.220 --> 02:33:23.740]
Playing around with my mouth.

[02:33:24.040 --> 02:33:25.320]
La, la, la, la, la, la.

[02:33:25.320 --> 02:33:26.500]
I speak in tongue.

[02:33:26.900 --> 02:33:30.860]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

[02:33:31.100 --> 02:33:32.160]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

[02:33:32.160 --> 02:33:33.160]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

[02:33:33.340 --> 02:33:38.080]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

[02:33:39.200 --> 02:33:42.180]
I can be numbered back on 80 over school.

[02:33:42.760 --> 02:33:45.540]
I said when I grow up, that's what I wanted to.

[02:33:45.540 --> 02:33:49.380]
But now it's run by greedy corporate wholesome systems

[02:33:49.380 --> 02:33:52.400]
That only care about the bottom by not you

[02:33:52.400 --> 02:33:55.920]
They are omnipotent, their power has no end

[02:33:55.920 --> 02:33:59.220]
They got to see you with daddy, push his friends

[02:33:59.220 --> 02:34:02.740]
And something so much important to hear instead

[02:34:02.740 --> 02:34:04.660]
They can't just hold the bell

[02:34:04.660 --> 02:34:06.420]
Your face was wired up

[02:34:06.420 --> 02:34:08.240]
They can't just hold the bell

[02:34:08.240 --> 02:34:09.520]
They want it in

[02:34:09.520 --> 02:34:12.820]
We're trying to give the lady upside

[02:34:12.820 --> 02:34:16.180]
We're trying to give the lady upside

[02:34:16.180 --> 02:34:19.700]
It's a bargain and the challenge is gone

[02:34:19.700 --> 02:34:23.160]
The sounds are saying no matter where you are

[02:34:29.960 --> 02:34:33.520]
The cyber radio you want we take its place

[02:34:33.520 --> 02:34:36.540]
They call the satellite to doorbell out and say

[02:34:36.540 --> 02:34:40.320]
And find the way for thousands of dollars

[02:34:40.320 --> 02:34:43.460]
If you would check that gift you should've made on the hand

[02:34:43.460 --> 02:34:47.280]
They all laugh, not in this far brain

[02:34:47.280 --> 02:34:50.060]
They can't give the lady upside

[02:34:50.060 --> 02:34:53.460]
We're trying to give the lady upside

[02:34:53.460 --> 02:34:56.940]
They're trying to give the lady upside

[02:34:56.940 --> 02:35:00.220]
They're trying to give the lady upside

[02:35:00.220 --> 02:35:03.780]
It'll get you to pay

[02:35:16.500 --> 02:35:21.320]
Don't bow guard that joy my friend

[02:35:21.320 --> 02:35:25.000]
Has it over to me?

[02:35:26.620 --> 02:35:31.340]
Don't bow guard that joy my friend

[02:35:31.340 --> 02:35:35.340]
Has it over to me?

[02:35:37.160 --> 02:35:40.840]
Roll up this other one

[02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:45.860]
Just like the other one

[02:35:47.340 --> 02:35:50.860]
Is the same to be a bother for it

[02:35:52.340 --> 02:35:54.980]
And I need another year

[02:35:56.940 --> 02:36:01.460]
Don't bow guard that joy my friend

[02:36:02.460 --> 02:36:05.320]
Has it over to me?

[02:36:07.040 --> 02:36:11.740]
Don't bow guard that joy my friend

[02:36:12.460 --> 02:36:15.820]
Has it over to me?

[02:36:31.440 --> 02:36:38.400]
Roll up this other one

[02:36:38.400 --> 02:36:42.760]
Just like the other one

[02:36:42.760 --> 02:36:45.800]
Is the same to be a bother for it

[02:36:45.800 --> 02:36:45.800]

[02:36:45.800 --> 02:36:45.800]

[02:36:46.800 --> 02:36:51.660]
And I don't have another year

[02:36:54.080 --> 02:36:58.220]
Don't bow guard that joy my friend

[02:36:58.800 --> 02:37:01.960]
Has it over to me?

[02:37:03.800 --> 02:37:07.980]
Don't bow guard that joy my friend

[02:37:07.980 --> 02:37:12.260]
Has it over to me?

[02:37:16.800 --> 02:37:22.800]
Don't bow guard that joy my friend

[02:37:23.380 --> 02:37:23.500]
Has it over to me?

[02:37:23.500 --> 02:37:32.040]
Don't bow guard that joy my friend

[02:37:32.040 --> 02:37:34.920]
Has it over to me?

[02:37:38.620 --> 02:37:42.800]
Has it over to me?

[02:37:42.800 --> 02:37:43.480]
I don't have a personal friend

[02:37:43.480 --> 02:37:45.020]
But it's Tom Feedler

[02:37:45.020 --> 02:37:51.160]
And they see and end is still all over

[02:37:51.160 --> 02:37:54.300]
The subject of the paper isn't being run properly

[02:37:54.300 --> 02:37:56.200]
I could have told you that 20 years ago

[02:37:57.680 --> 02:37:58.860]
Everybody knows that

[02:37:58.860 --> 02:38:01.380]
But I haven't gone in a hero building with a machine gun

[02:38:03.140 --> 02:38:04.180]
797 votes

[02:38:04.180 --> 02:38:06.780]
We're going to make Miguel a accurate prognosticator

[02:38:06.780 --> 02:38:08.040]
We said we go for 800 today

[02:38:08.040 --> 02:38:10.360]
We only need three votes and we got 22 minutes

[02:38:10.360 --> 02:38:11.300]
I think we can do it

[02:38:11.300 --> 02:38:12.100]
We can do it, see?

[02:38:13.200 --> 02:38:15.800]
Yeah, so three people who already voted if you vote again

[02:38:15.800 --> 02:38:16.600]
Oh, 799!

[02:38:17.300 --> 02:38:19.620]
So the next vote will be the 800th vote to which we'll go

[02:38:19.620 --> 02:38:20.300]
Like that!

[02:38:20.660 --> 02:38:21.500]
And then we'll go home

[02:38:21.500 --> 02:38:22.320]
Oh, I am!

[02:38:22.940 --> 02:38:26.020]
Listen, this has been pretty painless I would say

[02:38:26.020 --> 02:38:27.140]
And fairly entertaining

[02:38:27.140 --> 02:38:29.100]
I think this selection of crap I played today

[02:38:29.100 --> 02:38:30.720]
When you consider how little we can play

[02:38:30.720 --> 02:38:31.500]
You know what's really sad?

[02:38:31.600 --> 02:38:32.500]
I'm scrolling through here

[02:38:32.500 --> 02:38:34.800]
Desperately trying to find out that we can still play

[02:38:34.800 --> 02:38:36.120]
Yeah, that's right

[02:38:36.720 --> 02:38:39.040]
I'd say maybe like one out of five we can still play

[02:38:39.040 --> 02:38:41.560]
Thanks a lot of choice, you miserable, hateful, sour

[02:38:43.080 --> 02:38:45.520]
Glittery it, oh my god

[02:38:46.300 --> 02:38:47.460]
Heaven help us

[02:38:48.900 --> 02:38:50.800]
The Washington Freak Ensemblers

[02:38:50.800 --> 02:38:55.220]
Sometimes I feel myself

[02:38:55.220 --> 02:38:57.260]
Want a lollipop little boy?

[02:38:58.780 --> 02:38:59.820]
No

[02:39:01.540 --> 02:39:06.060]
Panthers of the Assemblers, Crappinals, a bunch of guys on Skates Start

[02:39:06.060 --> 02:39:09.640]
The fairly things outstake

[02:39:09.640 --> 02:39:13.300]
For we told a new pointy

[02:39:13.300 --> 02:39:17.440]
Who'd believe their heaven's sand

[02:39:17.440 --> 02:39:21.460]
With best speech of bad and bad

[02:39:21.460 --> 02:39:25.260]
Christmas joy, their fairly draining

[02:39:25.260 --> 02:39:29.260]
Carol's through them nose and singing

[02:39:29.780 --> 02:39:33.680]
Jesus truly did us wrong

[02:39:33.680 --> 02:39:37.820]
When he made the sing this song

[02:39:37.820 --> 02:39:41.260]
When we heard the fairly things outstake

[02:39:42.080 --> 02:39:47.020]
No, we knew that you weren't here

[02:39:52.620 --> 02:39:54.020]
Join the animation

[02:39:54.920 --> 02:39:56.520]

Have yourself them down on Christmas and fun

[02:40:00.020 --> 02:40:03.200]
While your friends away will back you all away

[02:40:03.200 --> 02:40:06.220]
Well you talk about embarrassing so I had to look it up in a hero on their website

[02:40:06.220 --> 02:40:10.220]
Which there's nothing new by the way about the standoff, the shootout of whatever's going to happen

[02:40:10.800 --> 02:40:14.460]
So it's Ottawa, it is the Senators but of course it's the Ottawa Senators

[02:40:14.460 --> 02:40:18.380]
Not the Washington Senators, not the Washington Crappinals at the Panthers tonight

[02:40:18.380 --> 02:40:20.000]
What a joky we are, Clarence

[02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.600]
What a climb, what an idiot

[02:40:22.600 --> 02:40:23.240]
You're fair

[02:40:23.240 --> 02:40:25.940]
When you think of all the benefits you're getting

[02:40:26.920 --> 02:40:28.440]
Life will be sweeter

[02:40:28.440 --> 02:40:30.060]
When you catch your heater

[02:40:30.060 --> 02:40:32.940]
And carry a license to be deadly

[02:40:33.460 --> 02:40:35.240]
Come on and join today

[02:40:35.240 --> 02:40:40.380]
It's the American way to be a member of the NRR

[02:40:40.900 --> 02:40:43.920]
Aim for the meat, aim for the chest

[02:40:43.920 --> 02:40:47.560]
And always aim for the head in case they're well, it's not bad

[02:40:48.120 --> 02:40:50.840]
Jarkin your skills, and give them more fun

[02:40:51.380 --> 02:40:54.380]
They'll be there to defend your right to hold us

[02:40:54.380 --> 02:40:56.120]
Come on and join today

[02:40:56.120 --> 02:41:01.600]
And you'll be proud to say you're a member of the NRRRR

[02:41:02.180 --> 02:41:03.620]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, you're right

[02:41:03.620 --> 02:41:06.620]
The following is a paid public service announcement from the International Raffle Association

[02:41:06.620 --> 02:41:07.540]
Let's face

[02:41:07.540 --> 02:41:09.520]
Most of us will never be rich

[02:41:09.520 --> 02:41:11.420]
Hell, we probably won't even be successful

[02:41:11.420 --> 02:41:12.920]
And that's pretty damn depressing

[02:41:13.540 --> 02:41:16.460]
But as usual with every problem there is a solution

[02:41:16.460 --> 02:41:20.360]
Hi, I'm Jim and I'm here to tell you a little something about handguns

[02:41:20.360 --> 02:41:22.340]
They scare the s*** out of people

[02:41:22.340 --> 02:41:24.640]
And intimidate them and in giving you whatever you want

[02:41:25.080 --> 02:41:26.700]
That's right handguns

[02:41:26.700 --> 02:41:27.720]
Think about it

[02:41:27.720 --> 02:41:28.620]
Need some cash?

[02:41:28.900 --> 02:41:29.560]
Rub a bank

[02:41:29.560 --> 02:41:31.080]
Don't have enough money for beer?

[02:41:31.380 --> 02:41:32.480]
All of the convenience store

[02:41:32.480 --> 02:41:34.660]
Take some chips and pretzels while you're at it

[02:41:34.660 --> 02:41:36.740]
It's all free if you've got a handgun

[02:41:36.740 --> 02:41:39.060]
Some son of a bitch cheating on your girlfriend?

[02:41:39.560 --> 02:41:39.900]
Kill him!

[02:41:40.340 --> 02:41:42.600]
It's a simple solution to life's complex problems

[02:41:42.600 --> 02:41:45.040]
All I have to do is wait the five days for it

[02:41:45.040 --> 02:41:46.880]
And happiness is just around the corner

[02:41:46.880 --> 02:41:49.560]
Hell, if you don't want to wait the five days who cares?

[02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:51.160]
Buy the damn thing off the street

[02:41:51.160 --> 02:41:53.180]
Just buy a lot of handguns

[02:41:53.180 --> 02:41:55.280]
It's a great alternative to working problems out

[02:41:55.280 --> 02:41:57.240]
And could be considered a population controller

[02:41:57.240 --> 02:41:59.180]
Yes, handguns

[02:41:59.180 --> 02:42:00.540]
They just might make you fans

[02:42:07.920 --> 02:42:10.460]
Down through the street's point that they'd go

[02:42:12.580 --> 02:42:15.680]
Think a dollar in the garden of a tattooed gold

[02:42:18.280 --> 02:42:21.060]
Each day honey got money for you

[02:42:22.740 --> 02:42:25.320]
But when you take them back it's the private

[02:42:27.700 --> 02:42:29.180]
Well, it's a job

[02:42:30.700 --> 02:42:31.820]
A job

[02:42:33.080 --> 02:42:34.200]
A job

[02:42:34.980 --> 02:42:35.920]
That's a job

[02:42:40.700 --> 02:42:41.780]
A job

[02:42:41.780 --> 02:42:43.980]
Take your clothes on, she is just

[02:42:45.900 --> 02:42:48.960]
I'm gonna hold you down to like a tuna fish

[02:42:51.540 --> 02:42:54.100]
Picking up a big roll of this fat

[02:42:56.420 --> 02:42:59.440]
You know only by the smell, if you can't wear it tight

[02:43:00.800 --> 02:43:01.740]
Throw a handgun

[02:43:03.660 --> 02:43:04.200]
Hey

[02:43:06.740 --> 02:43:07.320]
What?

[02:43:08.220 --> 02:43:09.720]
Let's take it out

[02:43:13.660 --> 02:43:17.120]
The girls used to hand the little big fat guys

[02:43:19.280 --> 02:43:22.380]
She no longer make the bulb inside

[02:43:24.460 --> 02:43:27.220]
Fat men take to the shower now

[02:43:29.740 --> 02:43:32.660]
And leave the stairs locked on the tower

[02:43:34.060 --> 02:43:34.720]
What?

[02:43:34.920 --> 02:43:35.440]
Go

[02:43:36.660 --> 02:43:37.820]
And what?

[02:43:39.240 --> 02:43:40.400]
And what?

[02:43:41.480 --> 02:43:43.440]
Fat men take to the shower now

[02:43:44.680 --> 02:43:45.340]
Cries

[02:43:47.280 --> 02:43:47.940]
Cries

[02:43:49.780 --> 02:43:50.440]
Cries

[02:43:52.260 --> 02:43:54.280]
Let me show you some good news

[02:43:54.280 --> 02:43:56.240]
8-11 maybe, 8-11 votes

[02:43:57.160 --> 02:43:58.280]
Are you impressed?

[02:43:58.780 --> 02:44:00.060]
No, you don't know

[02:44:00.060 --> 02:44:01.560]
Mr. Lecdern

[02:44:03.060 --> 02:44:04.400]
Save me a piece

[02:44:05.060 --> 02:44:08.420]
I'm disappointed you passed on Clarice

[02:44:09.060 --> 02:44:13.400]
Still eating people right after you kill them

[02:44:13.400 --> 02:44:17.720]
Not even eating behind a tiny chrome collector

[02:44:19.560 --> 02:44:20.580]
Fingerlicking

[02:44:20.580 --> 02:44:24.340]
He cleans if people taste just like chicken

[02:44:25.060 --> 02:44:27.920]
If you see an apple on the street

[02:44:28.920 --> 02:44:31.920]
Better honor you, I did meet

[02:44:36.900 --> 02:44:42.400]
Mr. Lecdern

[02:44:43.920 --> 02:44:45.180]
I've got to ask

[02:44:45.920 --> 02:44:49.200]
How do you eat things through that funky mask?

[02:44:49.760 --> 02:44:51.600]
Though it looks good

[02:44:51.600 --> 02:44:53.580]
You can't move your jaw

[02:44:53.580 --> 02:44:58.540]
The first animal to use a silly stone selector

[02:44:59.580 --> 02:45:01.220]
I wish I saw

[02:45:01.220 --> 02:45:05.100]
You pay a visit out to Chappacol

[02:45:05.100 --> 02:45:08.820]
Even cleansins on your next free

[02:45:09.580 --> 02:45:12.760]
Just remember your best today's here

[02:45:13.580 --> 02:45:18.340]
Somebody farted in here

[02:45:21.940 --> 02:45:23.420]
And I just keep speaking

[02:45:23.420 --> 02:45:24.540]
Stinging and speaking

[02:45:24.540 --> 02:45:25.640]
Stinging and speaking

[02:45:25.640 --> 02:45:26.800]
Stinging and speaking

[02:45:27.680 --> 02:45:28.200]
Stinging and speaking

[02:45:28.200 --> 02:45:29.100]
Stinging and speaking

[02:45:29.100 --> 02:45:30.120]
Stinging and speaking

[02:45:31.340 --> 02:45:32.100]
Stinging and

[02:45:32.100 --> 02:45:33.320]
In this little room

[02:45:33.320 --> 02:45:34.420]
I heard a big move

[02:45:34.420 --> 02:45:35.720]
When I turned around

[02:45:35.720 --> 02:45:36.840]
I knocked the room

[02:45:36.840 --> 02:45:37.640]
And in the end

[02:45:37.640 --> 02:45:39.000]
Here's the smell of my cartoon

[02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:40.260]
And with the track of doom

[02:45:40.260 --> 02:45:41.300]
A show ain't no perfume

[02:45:41.300 --> 02:45:42.700]
We got a chance at emission

[02:45:42.700 --> 02:45:43.620]
I'm not going missing

[02:45:43.620 --> 02:45:45.080]
Open all the doors here

[02:45:45.080 --> 02:45:46.120]
That's what I'm wishing to

[02:45:46.120 --> 02:45:47.200]
Can't get a spell out

[02:45:48.020 --> 02:45:50.560]
Pull the window up and jump down now

[02:45:50.560 --> 02:45:51.600]
Can hardly drop rest

[02:45:51.600 --> 02:45:52.460]
Turn the room here

[02:45:52.460 --> 02:45:52.720]
Yeah

[02:45:52.720 --> 02:45:55.120]
Run away north west east now

[02:45:55.120 --> 02:45:56.140]
Somebody

[02:45:56.140 --> 02:45:57.440]
Somebody

[02:45:57.440 --> 02:45:58.820]
They know they did it

[02:45:58.820 --> 02:45:59.700]
Got stinging

[02:45:59.700 --> 02:46:00.980]
Close it for it

[02:46:00.980 --> 02:46:02.040]
Yeah it for it

[02:46:02.040 --> 02:46:03.200]
Yeah it for it

[02:46:03.200 --> 02:46:04.900]
Somebody for it

[02:46:04.900 --> 02:46:07.120]
Somebody for it

[02:46:07.120 --> 02:46:07.620]
In here

[02:46:08.200 --> 02:46:09.480]
Somebody for it

[02:46:09.480 --> 02:46:10.280]
It smells like

[02:46:10.280 --> 02:46:11.700]
Somebody for it

[02:46:11.700 --> 02:46:12.340]
In here

[02:46:12.340 --> 02:46:14.000]
Somebody for it

[02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:14.720]
In here

[02:46:14.720 --> 02:46:16.280]
Somebody for it

[02:46:16.280 --> 02:46:16.800]
In here

[02:46:16.800 --> 02:46:18.680]
Somebody for it

[02:46:18.680 --> 02:46:19.440]
Yeah

[02:46:19.440 --> 02:46:20.940]
Somebody for it

[02:46:20.940 --> 02:46:21.580]
In here

[02:46:21.580 --> 02:46:23.280]
Somebody for it

[02:46:23.280 --> 02:46:24.320]
In here

[02:46:24.320 --> 02:46:25.520]
Somebody for it

[02:46:25.520 --> 02:46:26.200]
In here

[02:46:26.200 --> 02:46:26.600]
Somebody

[02:46:27.280 --> 02:46:29.420]
So cannabis

[02:46:30.280 --> 02:46:34.760]
Are all men need a brand

[02:46:35.280 --> 02:46:39.280]
High-polls and sea

[02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:44.440]
Will not cure your wrath

[02:46:44.440 --> 02:46:45.100]
Let them

[02:46:45.100 --> 02:46:47.160]
Make the shaggy

[02:46:47.160 --> 02:46:48.520]
Smudgey fire

[02:46:49.100 --> 02:46:50.060]
Sizey

[02:46:50.060 --> 02:46:51.680]
We think your good

[02:46:51.680 --> 02:46:53.580]
You see

[02:46:54.100 --> 02:46:56.080]
It's legal

[02:46:56.080 --> 02:46:57.820]
Judged according to

[02:46:59.100 --> 02:47:04.340]
A good old I will see

[02:47:04.340 --> 02:47:05.680]
A good old I will see

[02:47:05.680 --> 02:47:13.300]
A good old I will see

[02:47:13.300 --> 02:47:32.860]
A good old I will see

[02:47:33.960 --> 02:47:35.020]
Share a shit alone

[02:47:35.020 --> 02:47:36.520]
They weren't playing Washington at the Panthers

[02:47:36.520 --> 02:47:38.260]
Because the Leafs are playing in Washington tonight

[02:47:38.260 --> 02:47:39.700]
So unless they're playing with a split squad

[02:47:40.300 --> 02:47:40.700]
See what I'm saying?

[02:47:40.920 --> 02:47:41.220]
I'm dumb

[02:47:41.220 --> 02:47:43.640]
Not as dumb as you, Clarence, but I'm pretty dumb

[02:47:43.640 --> 02:47:47.700]
So anyway, here's the Harold website is really doing a crappy job on this thing

[02:47:47.700 --> 02:47:53.280]
But they finally put on a translation of the story that El Nuevo Herald posted in Spanish on its website

[02:47:53.280 --> 02:47:54.060]
Translation

[02:47:54.060 --> 02:47:54.680]
Okay

[02:47:55.220 --> 02:47:56.780]
The cartoonist Jose Verrola is

[02:47:56.780 --> 02:48:02.000]
Verrcated in the newsroom of El Nuevo Herald armed with a knife and would appear to be a submachine gunman

[02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.240]
The newsroom has been evacuated in the reports of injuries

[02:48:04.240 --> 02:48:06.400]
You're talking with the new editor of the newspaper

[02:48:06.400 --> 02:48:08.680]
I'm here to uncover the two conflicts of the newspaper

[02:48:08.680 --> 02:48:10.680]
Here they ridicule the exiles

[02:48:10.680 --> 02:48:15.340]
There are problems with pay, he said, in a conversation with the reporter for El Nuevo

[02:48:15.340 --> 02:48:17.560]
You know that the newspaper lasts little today?

[02:48:17.960 --> 02:48:19.140]
This little problem is over now

[02:48:19.140 --> 02:48:21.360]
This is a pigstie and somebody needs to pay

[02:48:21.360 --> 02:48:23.920]
Somebody has to do it because this is how you clean Schmidt

[02:48:23.920 --> 02:48:26.060]
It's about time now that they're mocking people

[02:48:26.060 --> 02:48:28.860]
Today they're going to see this violence but somebody has to pay

[02:48:28.860 --> 02:48:31.700]
And that's going to be Castello, he said at 11.43 am

[02:48:32.460 --> 02:48:35.920]
The cartoonist ended the newsroom at 10.40 this morning dressed in camouflage

[02:48:35.920 --> 02:48:38.020]
And got into an angry discussion with the photo editors

[02:48:38.020 --> 02:48:40.480]
They walked into the editor's office which was empty

[02:48:41.120 --> 02:48:44.540]
Upon entering he'd brandished his piece and began to throw things on the floor

[02:48:44.540 --> 02:48:46.720]
And say somebody has to pay for what's happening

[02:48:47.200 --> 02:48:50.120]
I was talking on the phone hung up and went to find safety in the bathroom

[02:48:50.120 --> 02:48:52.160]
Said the reporter Alejandro Chaparro

[02:48:52.160 --> 02:48:54.700]
With the minutes to swatch he began to encircle the building

[02:48:54.700 --> 02:48:57.640]
And the reporters are all there and CNN is having a feeding frenzy

[02:48:57.640 --> 02:48:59.540]
And we don't know what they have things

[02:48:59.540 --> 02:49:02.320]
The video they told us about Phoenix, El Nuevo

[02:49:02.320 --> 02:49:06.700]
And this is Neil Rogers, Force Radio 560, QAM

[02:49:08.400 --> 02:49:16.720]
It's day in Miami town at 560 WQAM

[02:49:16.720 --> 02:49:22.740]
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

[02:49:23.460 --> 02:49:25.140]
Sky gravy out

[02:49:25.760 --> 02:49:27.680]
I want some wind

[02:49:28.280 --> 02:49:32.200]
QA, T, no net, right like gravy, wind

[02:49:32.740 --> 02:49:33.600]
Absolute not

[02:49:33.600 --> 02:49:36.560]
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

[02:49:37.780 --> 02:49:39.780]
These are football, they are due

[02:49:39.780 --> 02:49:41.480]
A silent world of meat

[02:49:42.360 --> 02:49:44.440]
We kinda got that I want to do

[02:49:44.440 --> 02:49:46.240]
That's good to live to keep

[02:49:46.240 --> 02:49:49.180]
I want to hear it, who go on a date

[02:49:49.180 --> 02:49:51.280]
But there's no chance at all

[02:49:51.280 --> 02:49:53.880]
So does that make me a sports queen

[02:49:53.880 --> 02:49:55.980]
If I want to see him grab the ball

[02:49:55.980 --> 02:49:56.300]
Yeah

[02:49:56.300 --> 02:49:58.220]
Oh baby wow

[02:49:58.220 --> 02:50:00.540]
Look at that kid

[02:50:00.540 --> 02:50:04.400]
You ain't seen no net, right like gravy

[02:50:04.400 --> 02:50:06.020]
Wait, you ferret

[02:50:06.020 --> 02:50:10.120]
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

[02:50:10.120 --> 02:50:12.280]
I gotta hide every discreet

[02:50:12.880 --> 02:50:14.560]
That helps me see his bones

[02:50:15.400 --> 02:50:17.140]
I can do love I wanna

[02:50:17.140 --> 02:50:19.580]
But I ain't gonna never get done

[02:50:20.580 --> 02:50:22.180]
No days of a vision school

[02:50:22.180 --> 02:50:23.940]
Okay, that's not so great

[02:50:24.580 --> 02:50:26.460]
But I'm touchin' over the mountain

[02:50:26.460 --> 02:50:28.600]
At least until he's 28

[02:50:29.260 --> 02:50:29.900]
Yes

[02:50:29.900 --> 02:50:31.080]
I'm gravy out

[02:50:31.080 --> 02:50:33.420]
I want some wind

[02:50:33.420 --> 02:50:34.440]
Look at that kid

[02:50:34.440 --> 02:50:38.200]
You ain't seen no net, right like gravy, wind

[02:50:38.200 --> 02:50:41.220]
You ain't see no net, right like gravy, wind

[02:50:41.220 --> 02:50:42.880]
Look at that kid
