[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:11.440]
I

[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.060]
We go go go go

[00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.800]
Good morning, Mo

[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:22.820]
I had a fire call over the weekend. I didn't hurt myself that he was especially cranky on Friday

[00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.500]
He listens by the way to this crossover religiously. Oh, yeah, yeah, he sends the dies

[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.800]
Me as well up to me as cause you were afraid you're afraid of me

[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.980]
See can't he can't cover and the fact you know something I've been on the receiving end of

[00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.040]
Some of your barbs for years right and yeah, so

[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.180]
Exactly no, he can't relate to the fact that there are people could have to work together actually could like each other

[00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.360]
Oh, we have a history. Yeah. Oh, yeah

[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:59.740]
What's history so did Greg read having history too? He is history. Yeah. Thank God boys at different here

[00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.520]
Yeah, I know that's already you know what's going on right or what was going on this morning

[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.920]
What do you mean they had the sales people in oh boy?

[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.620]
Well and I didn't know we had any well

[00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.080]
They're gonna find out whether they do or not quickly the new boss came in here at 8 30 this morning

[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.720]
Yeah, that hello, you know

[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.380]
I'm at woodbine on Saturday morning which I had an amazing day by the way made a phenomenal comeback the first time

[00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.180]
My life I ever had three thousand on the line twice in the same day pretty good. Yes

[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.720]
I want to put in a couple grander rate

[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.820]
I ran out of there so fast even secretary couldn't beat me out the door

[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.600]
But anyway, so I have my blackberry and I get my emails on here that

[00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.100]
I'm sitting in my machine and the thing vibrates in my pocket

[00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.600]
Which is kind of fun and I look and there's an email from joebell our new GM and he gave me more information than that one email

[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.440]
His home number his shoe size his every contact number. Yeah, just a real nice email and I emailed him back

[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.540]
And I got more information from him and that one email that I got from his predecessor in eight years

[00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.960]
We're having lunch this week. Are you really? Yeah, and I bet you won't be sushi either no

[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.200]
Great. You know what great. I'm pretty good at the other day actually

[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.120]
He said that place is probably gonna go out of business with him

[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.340]
Yeah, he said to me that was one of his last comments to me. Maybe we'll get together one day and go for lunch and have sushi

[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.500]
Well speaking of sushi

[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.180]
We're in it. We're in the network sort of fox and CBS fight enough ignorant men

[00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.060]
I guess there must be millions and millions of them to watch those pre and post game shows

[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.620]
I mean that stuff is degenerated to a level. It just it's beyond idiocy

[00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.840]
Yeah, all the yucking and slapping on the back and are they fake arguing and Bradshaw acting the dumber than he really is

[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.840]
Which is saying a lot it's just it's pathetic. Did you see

[00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.560]
Matthew McGunney? Yeah, I'm with Bradshaw. Yeah

[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:50.580]
What was that all about I don't know I didn't think that was so bad. Why is that I like McGunney's very I don't know now

[00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.000]
Anything that Bradshaw's on is gonna be for morons

[00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.860]
Yeah, I'm not a Bradshaw guy. Oh my god, but anyway

[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.420]
So how about those bucks how they can't score any points and

[00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.960]
Like I told you the redskins aren't really that good. No, but they won they won based on defense

[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.480]
Based on that one fumble recovery run back to that

[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.800]
And return they also had a kick return that that's right. That's a whole game

[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.020]
They didn't know they didn't have a game much different from the giants offensive the giants

[00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.460]
Oh, but they you know what the giants and the redskins if you watch their offenses they were like

[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.440]
They were like out of the same cloth neither yet offense could do a thing. Yeah

[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.600]
The giants were horrible. That was one of the worst games. I think they've ever played Eli Manning man

[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.000]
He's just a pathetic

[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.580]
Raffles for the man. Huh? I like Raffles for her

[00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.620]
Maybe Eli's come on. You know, I was ashamed. Oh, you know for

[00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.680]
Smart and they play such a great

[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.160]
These bombers are the second play of the game

[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.480]
Which he completes that long bomb and he gets injured on the second play of the game and after that

[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.240]
For the next 10 or 15 minutes

[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.980]
I thought there was gonna be like blood on the field

[00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.120]
I mean it would the red the officials just like that game get out of control for a while there

[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.340]
Yeah, because the Steelers went in doubt. They always goon it up. That's a team tradition

[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.280]
That's their history goon it up like the bear is same thing

[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.560]
Dirty team the bears. Oh, yeah for years

[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.480]
They're tough. You know what?

[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.780]
Butkiss was a was a dirty was a dirty player right there, right? It's one time. Yeah

[00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:21.820]
He'd spit on guys

[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.080]
Really yeah, how about those patriots?

[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.720]
What's not leading them out of the mix may it look easy? Well, I'd always like a walkover. Yeah, that was a joke

[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.680]
Well, we'll see what happens this week. They go to Denver. I wouldn't be surprised if they won again

[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.700]
See Bella check does it again. I mean he could never admit it

[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.500]
But he he selected his first round opponent. He knew they'd be a

[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.480]
Passie a walkover and they did it I agree and now he lucked out now

[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.360]
He gets to play Denver not that Denver isn't good

[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.180]
But who'd you rather play the cold through Denver in the second game? So it gets to play Denver now a Pittsburgh and you know

[00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.560]
Pittsburgh could upset Indian accent in which case they'd be home against Pittsburgh. There you go

[00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.360]
And they already beat them once yep

[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.680]
So sorry rest my case

[00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.600]
That would make a lot of people in South Florida very angry three. Oh, we can't say three Pete cuz pet Rally will sue us

[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.280]
You know what they would start saying?

[00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.660]
Dolphin's beat them. Yeah, right three Pete

[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.840]
Did you know that he had the where did I see that?

[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.340]
In term three people he's with the Lakers and so now that anybody if you I see wanted to use it

[00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.820]
It was now they're not gonna have to but they have to pay him a royalty

[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.580]
What a guy go try and collect it now. We know I can stick down at here

[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:38.020]
He's got money coming out of every poor in his body. That's true. Yeah mostly from Mickey

[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:43.240]
So I think a lot of people have money from Mickey are coming out that we don't know about

[00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.060]
Well like some of the anti casino people

[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.080]
Oh, yeah

[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.320]
Some of the people that tried to put the kavasha on the slots. Yeah, oh yeah

[00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.760]
Between the Bahamas you know, you know what's going on there when his father was alive

[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:04.720]
That was definitely the case. I'll never forget when his father when Ted took off the letter to the editor

[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:12.440]
Yeah, remember the letter to the editor of the herald about the how gambling is evil and it's not good for kids and blah blah blah

[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:19.020]
Mm-hmm and this guy's taking the thousands of people out every day in the high seas the gamble right

[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:25.540]
Nine billion dollars. He took off the israel to hide for as a tax-roader remember that yeah, and you know what he

[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.360]
He had to be there a certain number of years to be eligible to take all that money

[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.680]
And I think he died like a three months before the deadline. They kicked him out. They died. No, he died

[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.360]
Oh, no, he wasn't kicked out. Are you kidding the money he gave there? I'll be damned

[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:49.000]
Probably Ariel's her own eight of most of the pros he was there was a story 60 minutes ran a ran a feature on that

[00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.080]
years ago and

[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.380]
And which they had four they called them legal tax cheats and

[00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.940]
He was one that arson was one of them

[00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:05.060]
They had they they went into four stories about guys who had

[00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:12.620]
managed to avoid paying taxes by either moving out of the country or some other means and I think you were the fourth in fact

[00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:13.440]
Yeah

[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.240]
Just a joke

[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:23.360]
But anyway, arson was was very prominent in that piece and one and one during one of my suspensions

[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.020]
Linda Robertson wrote a column and in the column she

[00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:32.520]
She said how irresponsible I was that I once referred to

[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.160]
That arson is a tax cheat when he was one of the most general skies in history this time

[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.400]
Why I was quoting 60 minutes?

[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.440]
But why would the facts get in the way of what anybody take nine billion dollars?

[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.880]
Is real to shelter with their source not to avoid paying you as taxes that would make him a tax to you would it?

[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:54.260]
Well, it's legal, but yeah still that was what the story was

[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.220]
Anyway very sad. Yeah, but nevertheless

[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.620]
Lars and he pays unless of course you're Republican these days

[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:07.620]
That's just starting to catch up with him real good, but Mickey's been a good owner a good franchise on

[00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.240]
Of all the guys who have owned teams in this town

[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.780]
You can't fault me. I'd like to have been a flying a wall in that meeting with him and mayor of

[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.280]
teeny-pini there. Oh, yeah

[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:22.460]
Yeah, when he got to go ahead to build that arena, but you know what he put up the advanced money now you're gonna get it back

[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.240]
But yeah, but the taxpayers have it's just like the

[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:30.420]
taxpayers are gonna pay it eventually right but Mickey put it up in the first place

[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:34.600]
The taxpayers are gonna pay for ever in perpetuity for that building for the white elephant

[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.640]
I think we need to I don't think that one's the way up by the way

[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:43.220]
I don't know that that building is a white elephant but the bad deal was made in Broward

[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:48.320]
Where the commission was supposed to remember it was gonna get money back over the years?

[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:53.260]
Mm-hmm chances of them getting a dime out of that place are slim and none I

[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:58.120]
Don't feel so bad about the pants as attendance. Oh, they actually won a game yesterday

[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:02.280]
Yeah, they shoot out but they won a game a role game at that. Yeah, against the little girls team

[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.140]
I don't feel so bad about their attendance after watching some of these other games

[00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.880]
My god you watch the game when a pant is playing New Jersey if there were 1500 people there

[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.760]
That's a lot maybe they covered the attendance

[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:16.320]
There was nobody there there never is anybody in New Jersey the islanders

[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.060]
I mean, I don't understand how a lot of these franchise is keep going there. They're not throwing flies

[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.460]
It nobody's showing up

[00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:27.580]
So if the pant is again like 10 12 13 thousand for real again. That's so far this season. It's not that bad

[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.020]
It's it's been increasing

[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.660]
somewhat not not in the not in the losing franchise places though. No, no

[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:36.900]
I'm sorry the paler

[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:37.820]
You know

[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:42.520]
Well, I had that nice hot streak here that you know people in that market they want to jump on the bandwagon

[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:47.380]
Well in addition to which you had the opponents like Montreal you had like about 5,000 frogs in there for that game

[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:52.400]
So yeah, it loses it up. I know I could hear the sound of rivet as I drove

[00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.560]
The sound of them chucking the Pepsi's in there

[00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:04.940]
Well, it was French Canadians man. We got a big election coming up here in a couple of weeks to weeks from today to be a 23rd day

[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:09.280]
By the way, I didn't do bad this weekend either. It's all good for you

[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.800]
I don't know time. Oh and Tom jikas is alone

[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.160]
He's wanted to know that he's leaving for California today

[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.620]
Is he really for another goody gumdrop?

[00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:25.160]
That means we can look forward to reading a whole bunch of puff pieces on all the network shows are the easy there for uh-huh

[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.440]
Lazy guy very lazy. It's his job

[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:33.100]
It's not his job. His job is to write about TV and radio

[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:39.960]
He doesn't write about TV and radio rights puff pieces on network TV shows that that suck. There's right anything about T local TV or radio

[00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:44.300]
If you want to hear that's correct. Yeah

[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.480]
All the TV

[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:52.480]
If I could would have he had been the guy to write an article about Greg Reed leaving and about Joe Bell coming in and about the changes

[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.860]
Wouldn't that have been his

[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:58.120]
Territory or nearly if he's the TV radio guy one would think sorry

[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:03.320]
Yeah, sorry writes about the ten words about it and in like in a Harold very jackass rights

[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:07.220]
It's so the only radio coverage for anybody in the market is sports radio

[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:13.280]
Because if you're not a sports station, there's nobody else writing about radio including what's a guy to Harold?

[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.860]
What the Kevin Vastard? He doesn't write that anymore. No

[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:20.960]
No, he's a baseball writer. Yeah, that seems to go with the Territory

[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:26.320]
It's kind of like Mike Mayo in reverse. He used to be a sports guy now. He's like a newsie guy a lot of guys did that

[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:32.660]
That lot of good newsy guys came out of sports. Oh don't tell me Tony cigarette. Oh, no, I'm talking about writers. Oh

[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.480]
Remember a camera. I'll martian

[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.580]
Yes, one day he was the sports guy and the next thing he was a news anchor

[00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:42.740]
Yeah, I don't know where he is and one day a Tony cigarette oh for years

[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:46.160]
He was a silly sports guy and then next day was a silly news anchor and just

[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:54.180]
Seems to go over the territory. There's a whole list of guys starting with James Reston who were sports writers and then became

[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.100]
news columnists and

[00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:01.140]
Sandy Grady with the Philadelphia Daily News and other ones

[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:05.960]
I could just see on his tombstone and might say here's James dot dot dot reston

[00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.000]
Rest in peace. Oh, just reston. No

[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:14.620]
That would be cute. You said tombstone. That's what brought me to rest in peace

[00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:18.160]
Right now you were thinking about pizza probably oh don't start with the pizza

[00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:28.660]
Good that's good idea. He's really hostile to everybody lately from what I'm being told

[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:30.640]
psychotic

[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:38.580]
Well, you know you and I have a long history of hating each other like poison and probably we hit mad dog too and everybody else

[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.940]
Oh, we got no, huh not really no

[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:45.820]
Just being sarcastic. I know

[00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:50.760]
Just my just my nature. I can't help myself just being sarcastic

[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:57.200]
Well, listen have a great day today. Yeah, you two go on Patriots whether it's warming up a little bit here today

[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:02.300]
Is it really bad? We've had like an Indian fall or something. It's not bad at all here. Yeah, no snow

[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:06.300]
Wait about it. No one's ever I had to say one quick thing

[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.060]
I dropped somebody off at the

[00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:11.840]
Hard Rock Saturday night. I was friend of mine's in from out of town

[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:16.040]

[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:17.520]

[00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:23.560]
Just packed pack right you can't get into place. You can't leave somebody off at the hotel

[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:30.920]
I mean I just you wonder why there were so vehemently putting all those ads on there behind the scenes trying to keep the slots out of the

[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.040]
per mutuals well

[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:40.420]
That the Gulf Stream thing is moving right along. I'm just wondering how long after the per mutual start with their own

[00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:41.960]
Slots how long before the Indians

[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:47.920]
Helms for the whole thing sure well, I mean well once in at least in Broward anyway the hard rock

[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:52.580]
They'll be able to put in real slots because this I'm not talking about just slots. They're gonna go for the whole casino

[00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.420]
I know class three gambling. Yep

You know, Peter King

[00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:13.040]
He's famous

[00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:14.920]
Sports royalty I tell you

[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:16.560]

Let me open the shindelands

[00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:59.600]
Why did you put a shangolier in the studio in the first place?

[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:02.000]
I wanted the place to look more like Lenin's equipment

[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.380]
I got the outfit here

[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:04.780]
Looks like I don't have to

[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:05.740]
I'm going

[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:07.220]
Here we go

[00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.400]

I'm sailing all Baghdad Toy Stars now just in time for the infinite holiday season

[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:51.340]
Got some great news just now on my email

[00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:52.240]
Yes

[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.920]
Is he still alive?

[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:54.980]
Is he?

[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.200]
Is he?

[00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:57.980]
My handyman, is he still alive?

[00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.420]
Quadruple bypass but he still alive all this morning

[00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:02.060]
Gotta take it easy for a few weeks

[00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:03.160]
Lay off the beer, is he?

[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.220]
That's my best suggestion. Lay off the booze

[00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:07.440]
Yeah, I can tell we have your lawyer, your liver for lunch

[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.400]
And anyway, in addition to which I gotta keep him alive

[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.920]
Because I already paid him to finish my fence

[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.920]
That's right. Can't get that money back

[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:15.320]
That's for sure

[00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:17.200]
While people have a habit of doing things

[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.960]
Just have a fight like that, you give them money up front and then they croak on you

[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.320]
That would be kind of bad like a cop-

[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.420]
Cut the crap, is he okay?

[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:28.080]
Anyway, a man who called a Liverpool radio station to take part in a live phone and showed Dine while he was on the air

[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.780]
Is that something?

[00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.140]
Well, by the way, how are the stirons on this serious?

[00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:34.200]
I don't know

[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.360]
I just know

[00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:42.180]
Do you have any idea, I mean, you put all this hype and you gotta tip your hat to him even if you can't stand his show

[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.700]
You gotta, you know, I mean, he was on everywhere

[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:47.100]
He was on the gambling channel

[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.480]
He was on nightline

[00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:51.760]
Over and over again

[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:55.560]
In fact, I was on a throw on this morning, I looked down there, I thought I saw him in the bowl

[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:56.440]
He just everywhere

[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.380]
Then I might go away loving

[00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:03.060]
And then Miguel sends me an email yesterday about, oh, that thing with Sirius and where I like to use his password

[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:04.420]
Delicent on how or this morning

[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:06.800]
I'm gonna tell you that child needs some Sirius help

[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.460]
He needs some assistance

[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.240]
I started his therapy this morning

[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:14.460]
Anyway, go back to this guy, this caller, talk show caller, croaks, what a concept

[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:21.120]
The caller, known only as Terry, was taking part in the magic 1548 show hosted by Peter Price on Thursday

[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.540]
This is in Liverpool, England

[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:31.520]
The DGA concerned when the line went dead, abandoned the show and rushed to the man's house in the old swan area to find he'd suffered a heart attack

[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.900]
The 60-year-old man was a regular caller to Peter Price's show

[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.380]
I'm just glad he died doing something he enjoyed doing

[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.140]
We all heard his last words, Mr. Price

[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:42.660]
He died in the middle of a call like a, you know, like a garler

[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.340]
Like that, and then it only

[00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:50.440]
Yeah, it was awful when I got through the ambulance was already outside his house

[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:55.880]
Apparently he was found in his chair with a phone by his side, I was flabbergasted Mr. Price be saying

[00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:00.800]
Terry was a regular caller of the show, I knew something was wrong when the line went silent, I just had a gut instinct

[00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:06.640]
Mr. Price appealed was listening to his for help and one of the caller's neighbors broke into the home to find him dead in the chair

[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.680]
The ambulance service arrived in short time

[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.440]
How do you like that?

[00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:12.600]
His last words were...

[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:13.720]
I'm dying over here

[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:15.220]
Probably with a British man

[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:19.480]
Speaking of that, well I'll tell you, everybody out there better watch your health

[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:23.780]
Yeah, better watch it because everybody seems to be croaking these days

[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:27.400]
Oh, they just decided to put Ariel back into a coma, I'm not making that up, did you see that?

[00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:28.420]
No, I missed it

[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:34.340]
No, they brought him out of the coma and he asked for like 16 bagels with locks and cream cheese

[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:37.780]
No, I'm not, the serious part is they just decided to put him back into a coma

[00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:38.840]
Where he'll be safe

[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.200]
Where the rest of the world will be safe

[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.660]
Anyway, speaking of dangerous people who are fat

[00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:48.080]
Vice President Cheney hospitalized with shortness of breath

[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.640]
Oh boy, let's all pray

[00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:56.020]
Vice President Dick Cheney was taken to George Washington Hospital early this morning experience shortness of breath

[00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:01.600]
Cheney spokeswoman Leah Ann McBride said Cheney was rushed to the hospital three o'clock this morning

[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:07.380]
Doctors found his EKG unchanged and determined he was retaining fluid because of medication

[00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:11.460]
He was taking for that foot problem that he's walking with a cane and he's stumping around

[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:12.900]
He's out there and a political stump

[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.800]
Cheney was a long history of heart problems and as a pacemaker

[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.060]
Oh, it was placed on a diuretic at the hospital

[00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:22.100]
The squeeze in the water right here like a sponge

[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.940]
McBride said the vice president was expected to be released from the hospital a later today

[00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:28.560]
A foot ailment force Cheney'd used a cane on Friday

[00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:34.460]
He said the foot condition was not related to surgery last September to repair any rhythms behind both knees

[00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:36.440]
Or his lengthy history of heart problems

[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.740]
He said four heart attacks quadrupled bypass

[00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:40.620]
A quadrupled bypass dizzy

[00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:44.040]
Two artery clearing angioplasty and a partridge in a paratrooper

[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:49.560]
And also an operation to implant a special pacemaker with his chest in place of a heart which he don't have one

[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:55.780]
A side effect of some anti-inflammatory medication is fluid retention which can cause swelling and shortness of breath

[00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.080]
Maybe he was reading some of his wife's cheney lesbian novels, you think?

[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.060]
Yeah, that's good for me. Got them all worked up

[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:02.880]
Maybe that was it

[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:08.960]
It's probably had a couple of lines ringing there for just a second I thought maybe we were going to have like a couple of callers dying near for us

[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:09.720]
That would have been good

[00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:13.580]
Got our new general manager as a taste joe bell

[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:20.740]
Everybody at WQAM, well everybody that thinks they're still going to be around is very optimistic and very excited about that

[00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.580]
Got that nice email from Joe at Woodland on Saturday morning

[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:26.340]
I think that's what turned my luck around, you believe that? No

[00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:28.640]
But sounds good, had a good day

[00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:32.600]
Yeah, I didn't hear what I was seeing, even listening to the crossover with Hank

[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:32.920]
What?

[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.160]
I had three thousand twice in the same day

[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.360]
Oh, when you start crunching numbers like that, no you're right

[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.180]
I had two different machines, Mom, my head cut a drift

[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:41.060]
Two different machines

[00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:47.960]
In fact, the second one was real a fortune, real a fortune, then you kind of hold your breath waiting for the third one to come up

[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:52.380]
And the big jackpot, Mom, but it was just a red seven for three grand, I'll take it, thank you, bye-bye

[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:54.680]
Yeah, I do like that

[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:56.000]
I'll take it

[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.580]
Walked out there with a little bit of their cash

[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:05.140]
1546 votes on the poll from over the weekend, which I don't know, I mean I see we could add a lot more of this pool

[00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:08.600]
I should have started early on Friday, there could have been a zillion things on here, but there aren't

[00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:11.360]
What is the most boring regular public event?

[00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:15.420]
State of the Union in dress 416, does that come up pretty soon? Yes

[00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:22.420]
PBS pledge drive 358, put a put a lid on that already, although I don't watch PBS anyway, do you?

[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:30.060]
Try to take front lines, some kind of line, you know, once I got this stuff on CBC, what oh I need front lines for it early

[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:33.660]
Those watered down documentaries, they don't show your cramps, Sesame Street, watch Sesame Street

[00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:41.900]
Give me that passionate eye on CBC any day, a Miss America page at 170, the Rose Bowl parade 158

[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:47.860]
Proble 141, I'm surprised I got them any votes, I can't believe that many people would watch it

[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:50.840]
New Year's Eve ball drop, 130, 6

[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.060]
Oh don't you love when the ball drop on New Year's Eve?

[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.120]
Already time

[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.800]
Yeah, the Clark loved it

[00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:00.980]
Oscar's 107, Emmy's 35 and Grammys 25

[00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:04.120]
So they love the Grammys and you want to know why?

[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:04.480]
Why?

[00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:09.780]
Because there's some musicians on there that like, not necessarily a new true, some people on there that like it

[00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:17.140]
Yeah, but as far as the Oscars, it's just a self-panting yourself on the back, overest up in those tuxedos

[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:21.100]
And point all the zoots suits, you know, just a crap, and enough already

[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:25.560]
Aren't we great and wasn't this great and the audio audio, you know, kind of like Howard

[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.240]
By the way, Howard Stern's on serious this morning, I'm serious

[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.800]
He probably still ran for the whole Roger

[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:36.000]
Papa Papa Pablius is 5.62 am

[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:39.000]
Or Oliver?

[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:54.260]
He had his kids, he had to win

[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:59.780]
They put one back into his heart his old

[00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:05.380]
But Dr. Chalde is a hardest fan

[00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:10.660]
But now we really know his heart is old

[00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:14.260]
No matter what we're told

[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:21.620]
Yeah, if Chalde's got a heart that's old

[00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:24.860]
Hope it's on its slow

[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:32.700]
He makes decisions, he has the visions

[00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:37.440]
He has the country under his control

[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:43.760]
While push is god game, it's danger-pogging

[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:48.460]
And that's what happens when your heart is old

[00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.940]
And it's old home

[00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:59.000]
Yeah, Dick Chalde is got a heart that's old

[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:02.580]
And it's on its slow

[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:09.880]
He'll keep on working till his heart is cold

[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:14.960]
He'll keep pretending that his heart ain't old

[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:19.000]
But it's really old

[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.400]
I'm tired of it, yes

[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.560]
Okay, now if the vice president should croak

[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.920]
I wonder what Pat Robertson's gonna say about that

[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:27.660]
What's god gonna be smiting him for?

[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:31.000]
Where do we start?

[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:36.140]
Well, I mean no, but Pat Robertson be one of those right wing acolytes

[00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:38.300]
Or maybe the devil, the Satan did it

[00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:42.060]
Speaking of dead people, by the way, two suicide car bombs exploded outside of racks

[00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:43.960]
Heavily guarded and tear ministry and bad debts

[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.640]
Are they killing at least 20, will be more than 25 and

[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:52.000]
The Americans were killed when a UH 60 black hawk helicopter crashed in a wreck early yesterday

[00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:54.540]
I mean the people there now are like

[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:57.200]
Erachis and Americans are like dying in chunks

[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.620]
You know, it doesn't over here, 20 over there, 50 over here, etc.

[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:05.700]
Not to mention the ones of course we're losing like limbs and eyes and all of these things

[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.380]
Like so many weeds or bugs

[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:08.340]
Yeah

[00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:15.060]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 in the Verizon and Singular Wireless Lines

[00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:17.120]
I can see it's gonna be a real active Monday today

[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:18.120]
Look at that phone man

[00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:20.460]
Can't you feel it? Can you almost smell it?

[00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:22.200]
I think it's caused Todd Wreckweizen at studio

[00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:26.040]
People are running

[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.940]
Maybe we can get some spy reports on Stern's first day on series

[00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:31.260]
Do you think any of ourself order people have it besides McGill?

[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:34.280]
It's entirely possible

[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:35.640]
Although he didn't listen ironically

[00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:37.720]
Isn't that interesting?

[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:40.660]
He's trying to get me to listen, which I had no interest in hearing it

[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:41.880]
He doesn't want to hear Howard

[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:43.940]
He just wants you to so that you could say something about it

[00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:44.680]
Oh I see

[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.120]
Well maybe you've similar audiences here

[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.540]
Or maybe Howard's brothers out there once they get this spy report

[00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:51.520]
You see with all the publicity going along with it

[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.640]
The fact that he's only got three million subscribers

[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:57.280]
If every single one of those who subscribe to Stern's series

[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:59.120]
Which I have a feeling not all of them are Stern people

[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:01.120]
But if every single one of them were listening to him

[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:04.740]
His audience is a fraction of what it used to be

[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:08.580]
When you're on regular so-called old-fashioned terrestrial radio in New York

[00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:11.380]
In LA and Chicago and Detroit and all the major markets

[00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:13.480]
And all of a sudden it's dependent on people paying

[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:15.960]
Subscribing 13 or 14 bucks a month

[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:20.280]
You're down like a fraction of what you used to have

[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:22.900]
But then again he's pouring all that money into his pocket

[00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.820]
And so it was Don Buckwald and they're having a good time with it

[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.000]
W.Q.A.M. Hello

[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.480]
Q.I.M.

[00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:31.380]
Meal

[00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:31.980]
Yes

[00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:35.020]
I haven't had a chance to listen like all last week

[00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:37.340]
But I'm sure that you've already touched on it

[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:42.700]
About that ass bush, governor Bush going to force that bill through

[00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:44.920]
To get public money to the private school

[00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:46.500]
Yeah

[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:48.300]
Did you guys already touched on that?

[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.720]
Yeah we touched on it yeah

[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:50.540]
Old news

[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:52.580]
I love your show man

[00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:53.700]
Thanks for the old news

[00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:56.880]
56670560 watch out you man

[00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:57.900]
Oh man oh man

[00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:59.400]
I'm going to kiss the ground and kiss the counter

[00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:00.820]
Right now I'm kissing it

[00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:02.520]
Look out old mighty

[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:05.440]
Just being out of that place it's just it's scary

[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.600]
It's really a scary thing

[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:07.960]
Already everyday

[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:08.780]
Holy cow

[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:11.360]
That town needs a gigantic blueberry animal

[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:12.500]
Magnum is sick about it

[00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.100]
And even that wouldn't help

[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:17.220]
Remember that fast domino song I found my trio

[00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:18.500]
Yeah I heard that

[00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:19.520]
With that long blueberry

[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:20.580]
Q.O.

[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:27.620]
How you doing

That was quite a project yeah

[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:29.860]
Perfect

[00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:31.540]
That's not like tires on it

[00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:31.900]
Yeah

[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:36.520]
First off I wanted to say the bird eyes apacot scrub fantastic

[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.240]
Okay

[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.360]
I love it but I still use my hand

[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.380]
I don't use a wash car

[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:41.140]
Whatever you like

[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:42.260]
Whatever does it for you

[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.260]
Second off what a shame about did change him

[00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:47.140]
I'm crying as we as we speak

[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:47.580]
Uh huh

[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:49.220]
Second off I'm going to go

[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:49.980]
He's back out now

[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:50.720]
Don't worry about him

[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:51.540]
He's back out when you're

[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:52.360]
Even on

[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:54.080]
Even on hateful as him

[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.680]
They don't keep you there too long

[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:56.700]
Well you know

[00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:01.000]
I start to wonder maybe they just wanted to give him some sympathy

[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:03.100]
Yeah

[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:04.880]
Get people feeling sympathetic

[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.060]
You were feeling right along

[00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:08.280]
Yeah moving right along I wanted to

[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:10.440]
What's the guy in Israel who's chicken

[00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:12.300]
Moishi Pupin

[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:15.680]
Tiny manoeuvres

[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.520]
A.B. Iskavible

[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:19.380]
W.D. Q.I.M. Hello

[00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:20.460]
Hey Neil how are you

[00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:21.040]
Pretty good

[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:22.460]
What's the guy in Israel who's sick

[00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:24.420]
Oh and I'm wondering about those NFL

[00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:27.200]
Pregame shows

[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.620]
Q.I.M. Hello

[00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:31.140]
Neil

[00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:32.020]
Yes sir

[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:33.420]
I was flipping through the

[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:35.360]
Channel the other day and I stumbled on this

[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:39.340]
Kenner Center honors Robert Redford and it was the funniest thing

[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:42.820]
Because they were showing clips from all the President's men

[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:44.360]
And and uh

[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:46.480]
List for uh Brogog

[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:49.400]
You know as the MC is saying how

[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.860]
If it wasn't for this movie and this from that maybe the President

[00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:55.800]
Would we would never have known about watergate

[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:59.160]
And the whole time the camera cuts the bush and his wife

[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.020]
And they look so uncomfortable they're looking around

[00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:05.080]
He's looking at the floor and it's just the most guilty look

[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:08.580]
It was like he couldn't wait for that segment to get off of his whole area

[00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:10.840]
Yeah but at least he's got Bob Woodward there to be the

[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:12.740]
Minister of the White House to the Angerford

[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:15.800]
A real shill Bob Woodward man

[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:18.580]
How he turned you know a little bit of fame that's what it does to people

[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:22.020]
Also makes them very pedantic so they talk about people like

[00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:25.600]
Senator Kennedy in a very strange and pedantic way

[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:29.040]
And you want to do real people really speak like that Bob?

[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.880]
I don't think so

[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:31.640]
Do I?

[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:35.200]
I wonder if he if he has his ball movements as our as pedantic as a speech

[00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:37.060]
Somebody QAM hello

[00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:38.940]
You have Lisa? Hello?

[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.080]
Yes sir

[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.040]
But Neil how are you there?

[00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:43.120]
Okay good

[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.340]
Man you picked up an hurry

[00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:49.400]
Neil I last hear the the uh howl Burton stock and doubled in price

[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:54.800]
You know how much dip chain you made last year even though his stock is supposed to be in

[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:55.940]
$23,000

[00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:59.400]
No no he made $88 million last year

[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:03.840]
And you're not supposed to profit off of young Americans doubt, sorry

[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:05.760]
Yeah well he's doing it

[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.080]
Unbelievable isn't it?

[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.200]
That's why I had to get out of the hospital to work this morning

[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.400]
He said a lot of no big contracts to work before noon

[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:14.720]
Absolutely, Neil one of the things they passed that bush passed

[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:18.420]
And why he's he's been trying to stack the Supreme Court

[00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:24.780]
If you know that he is the if he passed the law are he got a law passed the very first six months that he was in office

[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:30.240]
That you know most of the president's records become public record after 20 years

[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:33.920]
Everybody in your secret baby already know that that's that's why he's stacking a court but nevertheless

[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:37.720]
I mean everything this is that you know is this what it's going to be all day today

[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:39.140]
Because I'm going to go back to bed

[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:42.440]
I'll thank you for the show more but in so one dimensional man

[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.420]
It's all they want you know

[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:45.980]
Hey tell me what's it like

[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:50.920]
Yeah, no like that I didn't vote for him either time did any of you I'm sure a lot of you did

[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:54.420]
And now what do we gonna do?

[00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:57.440]
Go out and demonstrate in the streets okay go do something useful

[00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:00.060]
Go and nail up somebody's roof or something

[00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:02.760]
Well I'll tell you I don't have to tell you

[00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:08.540]
In South Florida right now trying to find anybody to repair a roof, a pool, a fancy and anything

[00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:09.800]
It's almost impossible

[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:14.400]
In fact most people they've returned your phone calls because they got so much work now

[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:19.460]
People who ordinarily would be like you know kissing your feet kissing both cheeks

[00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:22.800]
Now they don't even have time for it because it's that's what happened

[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:26.260]
We better than well not have no serious hurray canes this year I'll tell you that

[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:32.400]
Because it's going to take people a long long time to put the pieces of the puzzle back together again

[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:35.780]
And nobody talks too much about that it's all we hear about is New Orleans and Katrina

[00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:36.780]
Well guess what?

[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:41.360]
People listen to me right now they don't live in New Orleans and they don't give a flying crowd

[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:44.380]
All of some of them did have some Katrina damage but it was Wilma baby

[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:48.460]
Wilma right that was the band the sick pill was Wilma

[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:51.420]
And people are trying to put their lives together again and these people are

[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:56.980]
What are we gonna do about it okay we're gonna win peach him I don't see anybody with a serious impeachment

[00:35:57.820 --> 00:35:59.080]
Proceedings going on right now

[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:05.700]
And that's because you got a Spameless Democratic party there's still well we're gonna go after that lead ol man

[00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:07.040]
Yeah okay good luck to you

[00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:10.420]
Spameless jellyfish

[00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:16.340]
Waffled on the war just like Schumer on their Chuck Schumer is on the estate here's another one waffled on the war

[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:22.200]
They're in fact the Democrats ought to open up 8,000 branches of the Waffle House raise some serious campaign money

[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:26.260]
Because that's what they do best is waffle just like their candidate last time

[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:28.500]
That's what the great wafflers of all time

[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:34.620]
5 6 7 0 5 50 boy and seriously if we have to hear about Bush and Cheney all day today and then fat ass bush

[00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:38.220]
We already know those things if it's called restating the obvious man

[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:46.080]
I might not even read these damn articles here. I got some damn good articles Pakistan Saudi Arabia 9 11 how much did the Bush administration know all of it

[00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:52.100]
The death of freedom the rights of ordinary people to speak out against an unjust war and atrocities unleashed in their name or being crushed

[00:36:52.100 --> 00:37:00.340]
Fascism is at the door who else will fight it how do you like that gambling votes that sale from I mean I might just smit can't all of these damn stories

[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:04.680]
And favor some of these fake calls and favor of a whole bunch of these calls

[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:12.580]
Oh my god and who just sent this to me it's all the same stuff it's all the same stuff call up Randy okay

[00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:15.800]
Turn on scared America you people are driving me nuts

[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:22.020]
They want they want us to go back to the same old I'm not doing it man after all these years again away from that crap

[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:30.120]
It's the right against the left is more appropriate against Connie Chink it's but it would be a bit about no wonder we had cause these on here

[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:39.500]
Two people's fault not for mentioning that crap on the NFL if I have to see James Brown and his band a renowned and stick in Terry Bradshaw

[00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:44.120]
Dumber than sawdust and then other much a silly how he long oh

[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:49.940]
God just you know and why did I watch you think that's a good question because I never watched that stuff

[00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:55.180]
I watched it because the game might handle I do with the time the game was starting and there was nothing else on at the time yeah

[00:37:55.720 --> 00:38:03.480]
I mean give me a break how could there be millions of men's all men of course watching that crap stupid enough to watch that garbage

[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:09.100]
Because it appeals to it appeals to intellect so I like to get a call the first car watch that guy that's sick in Israel

[00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:12.440]
Moishi perfect that's a guy's name okay

[00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:14.340]
Macy Pippic

[00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:18.900]
Honey Shmendrick yeah yeah right see even go him like George Noah all the two names

[00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:24.240]

[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:31.420]
Oh yours too huh look for the QM van right now at the shell station in Northwest 25th Street 87th Avenue in D'Areal

[00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:36.160]
Stop by and pick up movie passes to watch the premiere of glory holes a glory road to Martha Dolphin Mall

[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:39.140]
And the van will be there until the passes run out

[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:45.740]
This is the legal right this is 5.62.8

[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:50.320]
It's how it how it's family

[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:26.000]
Why 10.47 he's still running around over there in the words you now somewhere in one of them Arab countries where all I'm right his yeah

[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.800]
Melissa and little Arab kids were like to go there because most of the populations under 10

[00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:36.860]
Here's the facts from Kim that's really depressing boy this really catches me off guard right after I made peace with your close friend Todd direct

[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:43.980]
There you know it's how I diplomatically I did that that was fine yeah I want Todd I can only tell people they just keep they still keep trying

[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:54.120]
Now that's yeah I thought I would get rid of him and he that's like any of these people similar buddy Troy there you say yes okay whatever you want just go away and it won't stop

[00:39:55.280 --> 00:40:03.000]
Use sales holes if you spend as much time selling as you do belly aching let's us out of South Florida and our sales department

[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:13.580]
And the Dolphans how their dolphin playoff games are coming I missed those over the weekend drive you see any scores oh yeah good stuff

[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:19.500]
I think they missed the two well too bad they won six in a row there just like a hand give me that song and then set the red skins one five in road

[00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:21.620]
That's why they were going to win which they did win but boy

[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:28.900]
Any team that's got Mark Brunel a quarterback I would raise four eyebrows on that say oh I wouldn't get the two excited about their offense

[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:36.560]
Anyway Kim writes she says I have serious so I can listen to Howard he covers the time before you come on I love with two underlines

[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:39.400]
I love the serious radio she loves it she loves it she loves it

[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:46.220]
It's worth every penny you should be on it please it says please well I should plead like I got a choice no right

[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:54.440]
Kim also reiterating another idiotic points that she made once before you know Kim I'm sure you're really a sweetheart but your eyesight is really bad

[00:40:54.880 --> 00:41:02.620]
Give her my ophthalmologist phone number and Tamerick I got a really good eye guy Dr. Moishi Pupik that's the one no Dr. Vend over

Gus is about as hot as 14,000 ice cubes all jump deep deep deep into your comia break him oh man

[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:30.880]
This this is what this is why are you really ugly guys out there that's good news for you you got a shot

[00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:40.120]
Because there are millions of women with really bad taste here's the facts from Steve O Steve says on here look at this the

[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:46.860]
Facts are pouring in Donna in for Lauderdale but first Steve says whoever told you that you've listened to Howard online by using his

[00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:52.140]
Past Word was wrong you can't listen to Howard on serious via the internet it shows only available on the radio

[00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:59.280]
Well excuse Miguel forgive me more bad information out that I want to hear it anyway also one for the pool the Jerry Lewis telephone

Oh whatever yeah there's no wrong way Jerry Lewis telephone have a great day you see with a little smiley face which he's probably looking

Right now have a great day Steve O somebody with a smile on their face as opposed to all these you know a hell of a way to start on a Monday morning

[00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:30.440]
Well brush to this and change that and it's old news but did you hear that your fat ass governor is trying to circumvent the Supreme Court? Yeah we know anyway

[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:37.440]
Here's some more depressing news Donna in for Lauderdale this adds on to the spy report that I heard over the weekend on Friday

[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:46.500]
Mo was on his worst rant I ever heard directed you but mostly toward Hank who is your pet bitch according to Mo you two just kissed up to each other and

[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:55.580]
Friday's cross over I'm listening really got his go to Muscrat that little drop and you keep playing which one listen I'm only that one

[00:42:56.180 --> 00:43:04.060]
No that's not the one the right next to that after he got done putting you two down he went on to poo poo the trip to station sponsoring for the Bahamas to play golf with Hank

[00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:12.000]
I didn't even know we were sponsoring a trip to the Bahamas to play golf with the Humper did you I didn't know Josh do you know about that? I did not

[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:19.880]
No first he said Hank needs to take a lot of balls because he'll keep hitting them into the water then he might play a fun of Hank's wardrobe and physique

[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:27.380]
And send how silly he'll look out there and Nickers checkered pants it is so obvious the level of jealousy is in all time

[00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:34.620]
I'm sure doesn't help the station choose to throw a fun golfing trip with Hank rather than offer one with Mo since he considers himself the golfing authority

[00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:42.980]
A trip with Mo talk about stale says Donna in for long enough your stale Mo your stale so is that people by the way it's really stale

[00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:46.660]
Oh for me but he was there always kind of a crusty guy anyway wasn't he?

[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:55.620]
Must be in crusty these calls continue to be so depressing oh no seriously I'm sure that one of our callers is going to croak right in the middle of a call on the year

[00:43:55.620 --> 00:44:00.460]
I can't wait I got any ideas for who? Oh I got several in my list yeah

[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:08.460]
Well there's one who's the top of my list who usually says your game that's the one would not be wonderful WQ AM hello

[00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:09.460]
B

[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:21.040]
Now what was that a mating call I think no what was that he said gay huh I think he said gay no he's like about two of the letters though

[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:25.560]
We couldn't get all three letters out maybe don't know the whole else he beg yet five six seven oh five sixty

[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:31.480]
Come on let's hear a lot of belly I can what about whatever you like today is belly I can Monday I can just feel it already

[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:39.140]
I'd be much more concerned about putting my house back together again in my pool and my fence and my roof and my life and my flooring and all of that stuff

[00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:45.880]
with most people in South Florida right now have a bitch of a time speaking of bitch WQ AM hello

There's a real good bulletin for you there right yeah

[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:20.300]
Now there's one of the people watching the NFL that I guarantee you on that

[00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:39.540]
Oh god he's still making me sick I just want to drive off the road

[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:44.160]
Go ahead tell him tell him to give you our permission

[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:46.540]
WQ AM hello

[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:48.080]
Hey Neil

[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:48.860]
Yes sir

[00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:50.180]
Hey what's going on then

[00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:51.020]
Not too much

[00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:55.240]
Neil did you happen to catch Michael Mayo paper articles

[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:56.920]
Yes they tell you

[00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:57.420]
No I did not

[00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:00.300]
I'm thinking about taking a look at it

[00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:01.080]
I know I always quit

[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:01.920]
I know it's about

[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:04.980]
About our fabulous voting machines

[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:07.580]
You know I always bring that to that myself

[00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:10.720]
But you know basically

[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:12.040]
Just real quickly

[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:15.560]
You know you have me fishing in my house and half the time I gotta give you the

[00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:16.600]
voucher for that

[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:20.140]
And I think I've lost my trade as well but be well

[00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:23.340]
Okay I'm Bobby Gizant as the Chinese say I'm Biggazant

[00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:24.540]
I don't have no idea what that means

[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:26.500]
Means be well

[00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:29.860]
Well listen since you're talking about you know

[00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:32.420]
Heim and Roth and all these other you lost

[00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:34.080]
What's that guy in Israel

[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:39.300]
I think his name is Sharon

[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:41.560]
Yeah I'll say that

[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:42.420]
That's the guy named Sharon

[00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:44.600]
Especially when he was 600 pounds

[00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:47.240]
1621 votes on the pool

[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:49.020]
I think I'm gonna have to start there the new pool

[00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:50.220]
I get about 11

[00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:51.860]
Maybe 11 and about

[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:54.880]
Because this one is from over the weekend

[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:57.080]
It's kind of stale if I dare use that word

[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:57.920]
It's stale

[00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:00.540]
And by the way happy Monday Mo

[00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:03.780]
What do we got today? We got Mo with 2 mad dog at 4-3

[00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:05.760]
So that hour's the day because we got no Panther game tonight

[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:07.520]
They won a game in the shootout

[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:09.160]
Yesterday they beat Washington 4-3

[00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:11.880]
And they were all out to beat a girls team

[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:14.500]
I was just one thing that looked so promising at home

[00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:15.800]
And they go into a coma on the road

[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:16.820]
They had a bad road trip

[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:18.700]
Curtis Stevens in 7 o'clock tonight

[00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:21.000]

[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.740]
And our new general manager Joe Bell

[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:23.940]
Who everybody says is swell

[00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:27.280]
And the old guy can rod in hell

[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:29.780]
See I'm not gonna be one of those people

[00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:33.280]
I mean when he called me last whatever was Wednesday or Thursday

[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:36.160]
I mean I was the very gentile and gentile and phone

[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:37.140]
We had a nice conversation

[00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:39.620]
The old GM but I'm not gonna go into this

[00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:41.580]
So well you know we really missed the event

[00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:42.780]
I know not at all

[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:45.400]
You know wait when your whole notice operandi

[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:47.580]
Is to lie to people and keep everybody in the dark

[00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:49.580]
And everything is like mystery and secrecy

[00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:52.200]
He was kind of like the George Bush of radio

[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:53.720]
Don't you see a lot of similarities

[00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:57.060]
Everything was shrouded in secrecy

[00:47:57.060 --> 00:47:59.120]
And we're always looking for the mole

[00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:00.720]
And who let this info out

[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:02.060]
Who let the dogs out

[00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:02.760]
You know whatever

[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:06.200]
And we're all running around the dark like mushrooms

[00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:09.620]
In fact the magic mushrooms went over big during the agreg

[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:10.520]
Read years of QA

[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:11.140]
And that's what I'm hearing

[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:13.740]
Bye bye Greg, see ya, hope not

[00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:15.360]

I'm out

[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:19.840]
A mo is a message if you're listening

[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:22.600]
You're a loser and if I see him, I'm gonna take you in the locker room

[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.580]
And pump, pump, pump, pump, pump

[00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:27.140]
There's the crow, I can't believe it

[00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:29.180]
I haven't heard from the crow in Aakoonze

[00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:30.440]
I can't believe it

[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:31.960]
Wow that is just shocking

[00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:33.860]
What is he said

[00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:35.800]
Going in the locker room and pump, pump, pump, pump

[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:37.080]
Alright, pump this

[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:38.840]
Dominic QA am hello

[00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:39.820]

[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:40.720]
Yes

[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:45.040]
Hi Neil, Neil, I just got me a brine, you dude

[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:47.260]
Boy, can you play the roster you for me please

[00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:48.200]
No problem

[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:50.560]
Happy sip is

[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:51.580]
Okay, there you go

[00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:53.720]
These people are not very conversant today

[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:54.580]
They haven't trouble here

[00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:56.280]
They're not here, they're not special today

[00:48:56.860 --> 00:48:57.280]
Are they really?

[00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:58.660]
Yeah, I can't see it on a year

[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:00.940]
10.56 or QA

[00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:03.780]
I don't know how long I'm supposed to keep promoting this thing with

[00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:05.780]
Glory, whole, glory road, whatever this thing is

[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:09.940]
I feel the tickets from the professors right now, right?

[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:11.800]
Well, I know, but how are we gonna know that?

[00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:12.980]
Because they're communicating with us

[00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:14.180]
They'll fire a flare gun up in the air

[00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:17.360]
Unlike the old days when we used to be, you know, get phone calls on a bat line

[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:20.120]
They would tell us, okay, well we're gonna leave it now to give all the crap away

[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:22.620]
I'm like that, they just, we were in the dark

[00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:23.300]
It's like everything else

[00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:26.200]
But your bell's gonna turn it around, you'll watch, here's a good guy finally

[00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:26.980]
Finally

[00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:28.140]
Right?

[00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:33.600]
And for all these years of being treated like garbage like some human swill

[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:36.340]
After all these years of the sales department being allowed to

[00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:39.920]
Replay fast and loose with our emotions and the lotion and all that other crap

[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:43.240]
And I've got, in fact, I'm hearing rumors about that sales crew

[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:45.700]

Who's this?

[00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:22.920]

Get out of your system because obviously South Florida's got a lot of momentum to spew

[00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:38.120]
Like that and they do

[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:39.600]
What a day for Monday, no less

[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:41.480]
WCOM, hello

[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:42.200]
Neil

[00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:43.400]
Yes sir

[00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:43.920]
Yes sir

[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:47.160]
If I run it, you play that bid by Dave Capreda

[00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:48.820]
Because that's about the time to start a listening

[00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:51.580]
And then I listen all the way up until 1995

[00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:52.500]
Right

[00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:54.900]
And I'm moving, I came back in 2004

[00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:57.820]
And then I get to listen for a while because I get things reorganized

[00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:00.900]
And then he left then on a yoga, now listening then

[00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:02.000]
Wow, God

[00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:07.880]
Ah, just when you think you get when you get one reach, one retard

[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:09.140]
And then all of a sudden it comes back in

[00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:11.240]
There's a second call since returning with his yoga

[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:14.220]
Get some no material, okay, when you go away for 10 years next time

[00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:15.000]
What a day

[00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:17.300]
Oh my God

[00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:19.860]
Now there's a guy that we would hope would croak on a year

[00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:21.440]
You open my ass

[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:22.460]
How do you do that?

[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:24.000]
56670560

[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.220]
Palm 560 and even Ryzen and Singular wireless lines

[00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:30.140]
Man, oh man, what a vast wasteland, just pathetic

[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:31.540]
WQAM, hello

[00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:32.480]
Not there

[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:34.760]
QAM, hello

[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:37.520]
QAM

[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:43.020]
WQAM, hello

[00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:44.220]
I'll be your bid

[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:47.660]
And our last one, WQAM, hello

[00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:49.260]
Okay, that's it

[00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:52.100]
Okay, good material, we're not building this pool

[00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:54.420]
So as a result, we have no material, nothing to say except

[00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:57.260]
Well, Bush is bad and Chinese and only croak

[00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:59.480]
And your fat ass governor, you know

[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:01.740]
God, like I said, Call up Scare America

[00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:06.440]
And there was an interesting possibility here, okay, we've been on for a little more than an hour

[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:09.720]
And remember what I asked about spy reports on Stern

[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:13.560]
And his first day on serious today after the $80,000 worth of prepoverility he generated

[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:15.080]
We haven't had one call about that

[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:16.660]
Good perth, let me if they're still listening

[00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:19.460]
I beg your pardon, maybe they're still listening

[00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:20.860]
Yeah, maybe he's still on there right now

[00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:22.520]
It's only $11.04, maybe

[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:24.700]
Maybe he's gonna go on to like one o'clock in the morning

[00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:27.860]
Maybe those people just took their terrestrial radios out and threw them into canal

[00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:29.480]
That seems very likely to me

[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:33.080]
Or maybe since there's only three million subscribers to Sirius

[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:34.840]
In a country of 300 million people

[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:37.540]
Maybe they just aren't that many people out there hearing it

[00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:39.400]
Except for Yale, who, and even he's not listening

[00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:40.880]
He's got an aunt listening to it

[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:42.000]
For three no less than he wasn't listening

[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:42.320]
Right

[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:44.100]
WDQIM, hello

[00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:46.600]
Yeah, I'd like to talk about the Sirius thing

[00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:47.360]
Yes?

[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:49.620]
I listen to it today

[00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:52.300]
And I think he's as big a bag as you

[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:53.920]
Yeah, and

[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:57.100]
Oh, good, good call

[00:53:57.560 --> 00:53:58.300]
WDQIM, hello

[00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:00.100]
Got it, there you go

[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:04.840]
WDQIM, hello

[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:05.820]
Right there

[00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:08.060]
Okay, so why do I keep punching these lines up?

[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:09.400]
I just never know

[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:10.380]
It's something to happen here, huh?

[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:11.580]
Oh, something's happening, alright

[00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:14.300]
WDQIM, I can smell it, QAM, hello

[00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:15.840]
Hey, me, how you doing?

[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:16.440]
Alright

[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:20.320]
I've had a serious radio for about a year and I liked it

[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:23.000]
And I was just clicking around after I heard you talking about the Sirius thing

[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.040]
I totally forgot that he was even coming on

[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:28.840]
And just as a syndicated show on there, Alex Bennett

[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:29.900]
Yeah, I know that, that's the...

[00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:31.180]
How the hell is that possible?

[00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:33.540]
And then Samuel, they have a lot of losers on there

[00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:35.900]
I think who is going to be the Martha Stewart's room?

[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:38.400]
I'm sure that every man in America is going to race right out to get serious

[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:39.620]
Because Martha Stewart's are

[00:54:39.620 --> 00:54:43.640]
But I found it and I listened to it for five minutes and how it's turned

[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:45.620]
Shino Stilfuck, but anyway

[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:49.440]
Obviously with one quote, when you were talking about Cheney about power

[00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:53.960]
Absolute power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely

[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:55.660]
I see

[00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:56.500]
Absolute

[00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:59.360]
5.670560, I didn't know what we'd call in

[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:01.640]
I know he's listening to these hours, but I know he'd be calling in

[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:04.040]
Nice voice, maybe he's up there

[00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:04.820]
How about Joe Rivers?

[00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:06.480]
WDQIM, hello

[00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:10.320]
WDQIM, hello

[00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:14.820]
WDQIM, hello

[00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:14.840]
WDQIM, hello

[00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:15.320]
WDQIM, hello

[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:16.800]
Police station, that's a weird

[00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:20.020]
Goodbye, how's that? WDQIM, hello

[00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:20.960]
Hello, NEO

[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:21.720]
Yes

[00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:24.340]
I promise I'll do the whole call

[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:26.200]
Yeah

[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:28.680]
No, our bank is going pretty soon

[00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:31.140]
Oh, God, WDQIM, hello

[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:34.140]
So caught up in a Hollywood star

[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:41.800]
Where does he have the phone when he makes those calls?

[00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:42.900]
We know

[00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:43.980]
I think so

[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:46.660]
It sure smells like it

[00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:49.960]
Man, I might just take all calls today, you know what?

[00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:51.020]
Okay

[00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:54.280]
I have some really important stuff here, but I'm, I don't know, I'm like

[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:56.080]
Save it, it'll be for run to the nutrition

[00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:56.760]
Huh?

[00:55:57.780 --> 00:56:00.160]
No, if we didn't keep up this face until two o'clock, man

[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:02.020]
We can 80's share to the U mark my words

[00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:04.620]
WDQIM, hello

[00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:06.220]
Hello

[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:07.040]
Yes

[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:11.440]
As far as I'm concerned, how it's turned stuck on any station, he's on

[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:12.640]
Okay, thank you

[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:14.480]
See, that's not what we're looking for, okay?

[00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:16.260]
It's just to call up and take a chief shot

[00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:19.280]
And, way, if you don't like him, that's fine, that means you're probably not subscribing to the series

[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:22.360]
What I was looking for, I probably won't get with somebody who would call and tell

[00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:25.860]
And, describe what the difference was between us, you always been forced to do this, you know what I'm saying?

[00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:27.520]
In other words, that's what it is like

[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:29.720]
What are they doing? What are they saying?

[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:33.280]
What was the, you know, but they don't seem to be anybody out there who's been listening

[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:36.480]
He probably is the big bill of goods, what's new

[00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:38.560]
What's the beef, you know, what is it?

[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:39.740]
Does he say it in, you know, duty?

[00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:42.200]
Oh God forbid, maybe doing one

[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:43.480]
WDQIM, hello

[00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:46.560]
I want to hear that, Hershey Candy bar fit

[00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:48.060]
WDQIM, hello

[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:49.320]
Hey, how you doing?

[00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:50.080]
Okay

[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:53.640]
And, that's it

[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.420]
Right now, am I on?

[00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:56.540]
You're on, you're in

[00:56:56.540 --> 00:57:02.240]
Oh, I wonder if the living with Robinson is going to say the same thing about our vice president that he said

[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:04.820]
That's why I just got to your sand five minutes ago, if he should croak

[00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:08.940]
I just got to your sand, yeah, it was the Lord's will because, but I mean, but it looked at about me, I don't think so

[00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:14.800]
In addition to which he's not going to croak because the evil old, the evil doers like that lived to be like 200

[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:18.980]
You'll see, his heart is old and weak, but just like my handyman Izzy

[00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:21.960]
Hey Izzy, lay off the booze, okay, sweetheart, cut the crap

[00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:24.260]
WDQIM, hello

[00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:25.340]
Neil, how you doing?

[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:33.120]
I read on MSNBC, they said Howard did a phone check act on Sirius

[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:36.280]
I don't have it, but I've read it on MSNBC.com

[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:36.900]
Robby Dan

[00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:38.740]
Yes, so just give him a spare report

[00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:39.660]
Okay, thanks

[00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:40.000]
Alright, bye

[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:45.320]
So there's a guy I read about MSNBC by the way, that show with Mori Pupik and Connie Chink yesterday

[00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:49.600]
Like I said to Hank, if that wasn't the worst piece of garbage I ever saw in my life for about two minutes

[00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:54.480]
Lucky you and tried controversy, they're sitting on the couch and he keeps reaching over and holding her hand

[00:57:54.480 --> 00:58:00.160]
Oh, we're not being mad at each other, but you know, that's good last as long as the Jesse Ventura showed it on MSNBC

[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:04.200]
You talk about a network, they even the peacock is molting from the inverse confactor

[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:05.320]
Just pathetic!

[00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:08.520]
Makes me to cause me seem like Walter Cronkite

[00:58:09.740 --> 00:58:11.580]
That's me to cause me by the way, no arm

[00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:12.680]
Right, get it right

[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:13.920]
Cronkite

[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:16.580]
Here's your boyfriend on line 9 again

[00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:20.920]
Not bad bad invitation, all I do now

[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:24.900]
It's like the GONG show today, you know, very much

[00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:26.280]
That's the way QAM, hello

[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:28.560]
QAM, hello

[00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:30.280]
He said, don't be pee

[00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:34.920]
Oh, let's hear it for Howard, that way QAM, hello

[00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:35.900]
Hello

[00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:36.600]
Yes

[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:38.300]
Let's hear to Neil Roger

[00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:38.880]
Speaking

[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:40.960]
Hi Neil, how are you?

[00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:41.500]
Good

[00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:48.580]
I've only called once and like five years since I've been listening to you actually longer than that

[00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:55.840]
But I wanted to tell you a couple of weeks ago I heard Randy Rhodes on TV, he made a bigger name wrong

[00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:56.780]
Yeah, exactly

[00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:03.600]
Yeah, and I don't know how I got it, I was looking for the heat game and somehow she's on and she started talking about you

[00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:07.060]
And saying about how you're the Godfather which I know you are

[00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:15.020]
But you're the Godfather of radio and how you helped her so much and she was so appreciative of you and all that

[00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:16.800]
I just thought it was kind of cool, you know

[00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:21.160]
That's it, no big thing, it's just I think you're great

[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:25.060]
And I know you don't like the kissing ups, I won't do that, but

[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:26.580]
Too late

[00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:27.320]
Bye

[00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:29.560]
Okay, thanks, bye

[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:33.020]
And he's seeing you when he get out, bye, that was good, you embarrass him into it

[00:59:33.020 --> 00:59:36.040]
Okay, here's our pool for tomorrow, for today and tomorrow

[00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:38.740]
What? Nothing, I'm just a...

[00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:44.020]
I wonder if I actually have this one available on there because I faceted the Eric and you never know with it

[00:59:44.020 --> 00:59:48.340]
Yeah, so it is, why did I say that? You never know, Eric, he's on top of it

[00:59:48.340 --> 00:59:51.180]
Now when he just got rid of the other one, the other one, the other pool sucked

[00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:53.500]
Oh, sorry Sean, that was on a Sean's pool

[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.000]
Did you like that pool boring and it was fun?

[00:59:56.140 --> 00:59:58.240]
Yeah, you know what I liked about it, it was one

[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:05.140]
Oh, as opposed to what or which, you know, the ones that George put some on here, no pool at all

[01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:06.300]
Which, and then...

[01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:07.140]
Why does it have a bunch of names?

[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:07.520]
Right

[01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:11.680]
What's your number one answer to this? Most people are, and here's my choices so far

[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:15.000]
And by the way, I hate to break the news because I also had my spy before I got before

[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.360]
For it's somebody, can you imagine that Mia wanted to go and put himself up there and

[01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:21.840]
Topped list of, I'm sorry for what our radio legends

[01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:25.960]
So I hate to break the news to people when I originally put that on there

[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:30.360]
When I said it to Eric, I was like about fifth on the list and I didn't even vote it for Skipper Chuck

[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:34.220]
Here's the original list, Skipper Chuck, Ralph Redneck, Rick Shaw, and Bishop

[01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:36.940]
I put my fifth then Hank and there were around on the line

[01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:42.440]
See what, what winds up being on top of the list, that's what the, the listeners make on top of the list

[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:43.600]
Okay, Dumbbell

[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:44.680]
Dumbbell, Dumbbell, Dumbbell, Dumbbell

[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:48.860]
Mr. Known Asher, Guard and Iraq God is this guy stupid, nothing worse than being stupid

[01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:55.080]
Okay, here it is, most people are decent, stupid, whatever comes up alive

[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:55.480]
That does

[01:00:56.080 --> 01:01:03.980]
Hypocrits, Ugly, Bigots, A-Holes, Reasonable, Jerks, Proverts, one-dimensional

[01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:05.820]
And then Jerry Lewis-Teloson

[01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:07.100]
I don't know, yeah

[01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:11.200]
I don't think it's the honest country I already told Eric to take it off

[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:13.980]
Oh my God, most people are the Jerry Lewis-Teloson

[01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:15.840]
Wow, so what's your vote for?

[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:19.280]
I didn't vote for anything yet, but I think I'm going to vote for that one

[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:20.300]
The begins with an A

[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:21.200]
Okay

[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:24.640]
Well, I was kind of influenced by the first and a bunch of calls we had so far this week

[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:26.480]
Oh, there's so many appropriate choices on here

[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:28.740]
I know, this is a tough one, put on your thinking crap

[01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:30.700]
Yeah, vote for a tough choice

[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:30.920]
Stupid

[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:36.060]
Most people are hypocrites, three, stupid, three, decent, two, A-Holes, one

[01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:38.460]
Oh, that's my, and Jerry Lewis-Teloson is still on there

[01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:40.720]
Eric, I'm sure he's working on it fibrously right now

[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:41.720]
Any second, then

[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:43.460]

If your mattress is more than 10 years older, it's noticeably sagging or lumpy

[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:06.880]
Time for a new one

[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:09.640]
Choose from the complete line of all the top names in a mattress business

[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:13.480]

Off the last as because it stands for STU-PENDIST SAVING

[01:02:56.340 --> 01:03:03.060]
This is Neil Rogers. This is 5.62 AM

[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:07.340]
Triple VAT, triple T, triple HARSBITES

[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:11.340]
It's a coronary on a cross triple VAT, or pizza

[01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:12.480]
Heart monitor, soul service

[01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:21.500]
This is one of the weakest, most baseless indictments in American history

[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:28.280]
It's a charge that cannot hold up even under the most glancing scrutiny

[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:31.420]
What a down in a DC town

[01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:35.260]
The first lady said, we're coming, it's not allowed

[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:40.200]
For the Lincoln pay by dances we've heard enough, but you still

[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:43.140]
Think it and it says we call your flu

[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:50.960]
Dorol down to lay it was bad guy down to lay

[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:54.140]
Who said the corporate donations to the candidates

[01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:59.140]
It's inconvenient to take a lot for a down the way

[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:03.860]
Got in a little washing machine, now the show

[01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:07.180]
For the housema drawer nearly in a van

[01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:10.920]
But sure he got tons of lace but dead

[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:15.280]
Gets him at a date with when they found his place

[01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:22.720]
For all time to lay it was bad guy down to lay

[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:26.640]
Who just grew fat in our government and crammed on space

[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:30.740]
So now what you gonna say down to lay

[01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:34.680]
I have done nothing wrong, I have done nothing wrong

[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:38.440]
I'm ethical or I might add unprecedented

[01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:42.500]
1119 won't see him by no more and no time soon

[01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:45.080]
Look at that Q-56 and we got 56 votes on the new poll

[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:46.640]
How do you like that? Are you impressed or what?

[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:47.700]
Well, moderately

[01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:49.580]
What's your number one answer to this?

[01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:51.580]
Most people are A-holes 15

[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:53.960]
Stupid, 15

[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:57.440]
How about stupid A-holes? That's funny, that's about each of our choices

[01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:58.760]
15 and peace

[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:28.460]
1-5, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3

5 5 5 5 5 4, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 5 6 Y fill 12 172 put away the

[01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:58.440]
six plates 3 down 8. Be

[01:05:58.440 --> 01:05:58.440]

[01:05:58.440 --> 01:05:58.440]

[01:05:58.440 --> 01:05:58.440]

[01:05:58.440 --> 01:05:58.440]

[01:05:58.440 --> 01:05:58.440]

[01:05:58.440 --> 01:05:58.440]

[01:05:58.440 --> 01:05:58.440]

[01:05:58.440 --> 01:05:58.440]

[01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:03.940]
flow. Reverend Rob Schneck, who identified himself as an evangelical Christian and president

[01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:09.080]
of the National clergy council in Washington. Reverend Schneck, or I keep saying Schneck,

[01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:13.520]
rhymes with direct, Reverend Schneck called the consecration service to kick off in a series

[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:15.920]
of prayer meetings that will continue throughout the confirmation hearing.

[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:19.680]
Capitol Hill police said they weren't aware that the three had entered the room, uh,

[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:23.240]
hearing room earlier, but added that the hearing rooms typically are locked because they're

[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:27.260]
not of interest to anybody. Lieutenant Dominic Costas said the Ducier committee room will

[01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:31.340]
be swept for bombs and perhaps for electric bugging equipment before the hearing begins.

[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:36.700]
The three ministers insisted they were taking sides in the elite of debate. This is not a pro-elito

[01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:41.320]
prayer and insisted where they Reverend Patrick Mahoney, a real lunatic director of the Christian

[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:47.020]
defense coalition, a real speaker, you know him? Want to Mr. Ego's buddy? Hill, well, with abortion,

[01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:50.580]
public prayer, gay marriage and rights-to-law issues among those topping public debate,

[01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:54.760]
God is interested in what goes on in the nomination hearing Reverend Shank said.

[01:06:55.320 --> 01:07:01.060]
The two men along with Grace Nwachuku, General Marjore, a group called Faith and Action,

[01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:05.340]
read three Psalms outside the committee room, not to say to Lord's Prayer, and marked a cross

[01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:11.000]
on oil on the committee door before leaving. Reverend Shank said he and the Reverend Mahoney

[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.100]
had blessed the same room before hearings for Chief Justice John Roberts last year,

[01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:18.140]
and then the hearing went very, very well. The Lord took care of him, okay? The Lord just like the

[01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:22.940]
Lord took out hair all of them. You know, I saw someone had crap, which I'm trying to avoid that

[01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:27.720]
because they're still whipped up into a frenzy about the cool minors. Yes, but I saw some of that

[01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:31.480]
crap where they, you know, they came up with the erroneous information that they were all still alive.

[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:37.020]
Oh, praise Jesus and praise God and God answered our prayer. And then all of a sudden like three

[01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:44.780]
hours later, that gosh dang it, you know, stuff. All good Christians here, but we're starting to

[01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:52.680]
lose our faith. Let's say, here's a fact that says, didn't listen myself, but 13 bucks a month

[01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:58.980]
is one thing, having to buy all new radios at 100 bucks plus forget it. What does that mean?

[01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:03.400]
In other words, it's not just 13 bucks a month. You got to get the, you know, the radio everywhere

[01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:07.240]
you want to listen to your radio, one for your car or that little power. Really, Hickey. Sure.

[01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:11.980]
You know, it's about to equip it. Well, Howard Wright, who writes for the Chicago Tribune writes

[01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:18.280]
today. Thanks to whoever thanks to sin, by the way. Howard Stern, un-sensured, un-interesting.

[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:23.700]
How do you like that? Un-sensured and un-interesting. If there's a four-letter word or outrageous

[01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:27.260]
sex act that didn't get mentioned in Howard Stern's new satellite radio show, it wasn't for lack of

[01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:32.060]
trying, writes Howard. Words that once were bleeped on Stern's terrestrial radio program,

[01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:37.240]
previously broadcasted in Chicago and WCKG, float uninterrupted on Howard 101, the serious

[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:42.760]
satellite frequency of this airing Stern's reincarnated show. And though it's true, they

[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:47.220]
triple-x-rated comedy bits and salty on-air pattern didn't wholly define the program. The show

[01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:51.280]
unquestionably plunged more deeply than ever in the material that many listeners would consider

[01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:56.500]
obscene. On purely comedic terms, however, the satellite debut proved surprisingly flat.

[01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:03.140]
The program unfolding more as a promotion of Stern's latest venture than as a, was that say?

[01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:09.500]
Something radio show? I don't can't read that word. This is a bad facts. As a something radio show,

[01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:15.500]
VO, whatever. VO. After opening with several minutes of technical difficulties, including

[01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:21.060]
microphones that produced piercing feedback. I wouldn't you think that Mel Carmesen and all

[01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:24.760]
them people over there could do better than that? With all that big money they got, all those

[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:28.340]
millions and millions, uh, when you think that they'd be serious? I mean, the one thing that

[01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:32.100]
I understand us with our technical difficulties, but at least our microphone ain't feeding back yet.

[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.600]
We've heard it as long time cast, nearly struggled, but clearly struggled to find something

[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:42.620]
interesting to discuss. Is that on the first day? Oh no. The initial report, they sounded

[01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:47.320]
spares, slow, and stumbling, a palpable lectum that even Stern seemed to acknowledge.

[01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:52.280]
I hyped this thing so much it could never ever lift anyone's expectations had, Stern,

[01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:56.640]
who had as best as proven capable of brilliant satire and true political commentary.

[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:02.600]
Before long, he was playing unedited excerpts of the Celacius voicemail, messages that TV

[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:06.900]
personality Pato Bryan infamously left on a woman's voicemail last year, causing a mini scandal,

[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:11.360]
aired ribald prank phone calls, and played a bit in which an impersonator of David Letterman

[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:16.620]
dubbed Evil Dave described a series of sex fantasies in remarkable detail. Neither the

[01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:21.000]
pattern of the show's new announcer, George Tekai, who was Mr. Sula on the original Star Trek.

[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:24.640]
Is that how you said? I've known it. I've known it.

[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:24.720]

[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:29.080]
North Stern's taken out from the fact that he'd gotten married quickly retracted, offered much more

[01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:34.380]
than a chuckle. Kind of like, like that. Oh, yet this was just day one of the program,

[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:37.960]
and Stern will have plenty of time which to find his voice in a new setting, judging by the opening

[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:41.800]
installment he'll need it. Oh, man. Wow. That's not like a shot to me.

[01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:48.060]
But then he'll know what to why not. So far we've had not a single spy report from anybody out there,

[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:52.360]
not one. Yeah, I just people that don't like how we're not, oh, I heard two minutes of

[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:56.500]
any, he's always sucked me still, so what's that? You know, first of all, he didn't like him in

[01:10:56.500 --> 01:11:00.780]
the first place. What are you doing listening to it? Right. While I was doing my research,

[01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:06.580]
you know, I was all like crap, not buying it, just like these people. I listened to Rush because

[01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:11.960]
I want to hear what the other side was saying. Look for the QM van. I guess they still haven't

[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:17.100]
given away those Dan movie passes. I reckon. Look for the QM van at the Shell Station in North

[01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:21.520]
West 25th Street in 87th Avenue, D'Areal. Stop by to pick up movie passes to actually premiere

[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:25.940]
of Glory Road to Marth, the Dolphin Mall, free movie passes. Maybe the van will be there till the

[01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:32.660]
passes pass out or they do. One or the other. Evidently, not too many people want those or

[01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:36.140]
many. Everybody's on the serious. Well, maybe we're done today. Maybe nobody told us because look

[01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:42.800]
at these calls so far. Maybe we're finished now. The terrestrial radio is out of business. We're dead.

[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.780]
And things were going to be so good with Joe Bell in charge too. You know, and you guys are moving

[01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:51.220]
to another building. That's right, which was a really big secret until like about two minutes ago.

[01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:56.460]
So that Joe can oversee kiss and QAM and hold it. Plus, the lease in that building is

[01:11:56.460 --> 01:12:00.080]
ending. Boy, you're going to miss those Schmutzie walls. I'll tell you that. No, well,

[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:04.060]
and they're really fancy carpeting. Speaking of carpeting, dry concepts is the best in the

[01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:07.940]

1-800-248-5071. That's 1-800-248-5071 around the wicked web. It's dryconcepts.com.

[01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:14.040]
This is Neil Rogers. This is 5.62-8-8.

[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:21.920]
All that the most talked about here many years is now the musical event of the year. The

[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:35.460]
broke back mountain soundtrack. The songs you love from the movie you're afraid to admit you love.

[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:48.300]
Strap on your leather chaps and yell, write them cowboy. The broke back mountain soundtrack.

[01:13:52.240 --> 01:14:02.720]
It's fun to stay at the YMCA. They have everything for young men who enjoy. You can hang out with all the

[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:10.300]
boys. Well, they look more sans goodies. Let me tell you a 28-till note. So anyway FMQB which is

[01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:14.840]
in a Howard in fact there about 15 feet into his... Right, go man. I was told to do that about

[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:18.880]
that website. What are they used for light in there? How it may flash light. I would

[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:23.500]
say that. Howard's film made his long way. Hopefully not a candle. Made his long way to debut

[01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:27.780]
on Sirius satellite radio day. Well, there were a few technical riches at the start. Once during

[01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:31.660]
the screw-bout rolling it was business as usual with only a couple of noticeable changes in the

[01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:36.420]
program. The first is the hiring of George Tecai to Kai, whatever his name is, as you know

[01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:40.640]
it's a first-earned program. Best known as Star Tracks Sulu. He was live in the studio for his

[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:45.540]
debut. The other was the Lackin commercials. They start with commercials tomorrow, six in an hour.

[01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:51.440]
As Stern's debut when commercial free and lasted well into the 11 a.m. hour. No wonder we couldn't

[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:57.780]
get any spy reports. They're glued to Howard, man. Both of them. So they're going to be playing

[01:14:57.780 --> 01:15:04.440]
commercials? Yeah. Six units per hour. Okay. It's supposed to be commercial free but they live.

[01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:10.320]
More Stern's channel on upkicks off today including a daily wrap-up show with Gary Delabata

[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:15.240]
and John Heine and that debut of Bubba to Love Sponsor in the afternoon drive. Delabata took home

[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:19.460]
the price for the first curse word out of during the day. Bubba suggested playing Ben Fools,

[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:23.820]
Bitches Ain't Schmitt. Though later in the program Stern dropped the first f-bomb.

[01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:28.220]
Stern also denied during his program that he married long-time girlfriend Beth Astrosky

[01:15:28.220 --> 01:15:32.880]
has suggested reports elsewhere. Meanwhile, Stern fans expect a podcast via iTunes.

[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:38.080]
There is a Stern podcast page currently available to iTunes but today only contains a woman at

[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:42.620]
17 second ad for his serious program. In other words, they're not quite so serious yet.

[01:15:43.020 --> 01:15:47.280]
There's the FMQB review which is like I said, they're big groupies. Still got those movie

[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:51.440]
passes over there? I suppose. I don't think they're going to tell you when they leave. I'm not

[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:54.500]
going to keep reading that thing. We've been reading it for an hour and a half. How many passes could

[01:15:54.500 --> 01:16:02.200]
they have had? But Stern, man. We're in choir and... Yeah. 70 QYM. Hello. Hey, Neil. How you doing?

[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:07.400]
Okay, sir. Hey, buddy. For your poll, I can't believe you forgot the best answer for that.

[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:11.600]
Yeah. For 20 years. What do you even tell us about the people in this town? Are.

[01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:18.560]
I'm waiting. Lightless. They have no lights. Okay. That'd be a great

[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:21.960]
attribute number one answer for that poll. Okay, let's put it on there and see if it is. Okay,

[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:27.460]
lifeless. Okay. I have no life. Let's get it on there. Most people are lifeless. Do you think

[01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:33.320]
it's going to be the number one answer? No. No. 567-0560, pound five, 60 in the Verizon and

[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:39.940]
all. Look at that. There's the hospital director Hadasa Yadi about Ariel Saron, Shlomo Yitzhak

[01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:44.560]
Proman. Can you to reduce that place over the next. So, Fadi could barely walk and I'm very

[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:49.560]
surprised that he's having any ailments, aren't you? Yeah, I'm shocked and displayed. You think

[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:52.600]
that when you would eat that much, you'd have enough padding that would kind of like buffer you

[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:59.620]
against all external forces. 70 QYM. Hello. Now, Neil, you're doing a heck of a job. 70 QYM. Hello.

[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:07.240]
Neil. Yes, sir. Well, Carl, I listen to part of the Stern Show. I went up to Charlotte and I've

[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:10.920]
got you on because I won't be able to listen to you for a couple of months and I can listen to

[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:16.880]
him any time. Right. He wasn't the same. He seemed uncomfortable. It just wasn't the same show.

[01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:22.800]
And if they're going to have commercials, I'm a little pissed because I paid 137 for a home unit,

[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:29.000]
the car unit, and I've got CD and the car and I've got the radio. I don't know what the hell I did.

[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:38.140]
Yeah. Come, you want to refund? Yeah. How a good day. I'm back to it. It's not a little PO, didn't it?

[01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:42.580]
A little bit. It's out a little bit off his feet after hearing about it. You know, forget it's

[01:17:42.580 --> 01:17:50.040]
only the first day, though. Don't hate it. 567 05 60 pound 560 on the rest of the singular wireless lines.

[01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:56.660]
WQYM. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Just remember, they're only two truths in life. You can't

[01:17:56.660 --> 01:18:02.680]
win with a black quarterback. And the Holocaust never happened. Okay. 567 05 50.

[01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:09.260]
Q a M. Hello. Yeah, Neil. Yeah. Hey, yeah, I just call it to let you know that I passed my 1030.

[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:15.760]
At, you know, the show 87th and 25th is nobody there. No WQM band. Nothing.

[01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:21.760]
Thanks for the good news, Pellie. I have to get it from our audience. Well, I just called

[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:24.760]
Miguel. I say, hey, you're going to let me know when those are done. Right? He's in. Yep.

[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:31.060]
Of course, actually, he said so in other words, they're there. That's what he said. Maybe this guy

[01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:36.440]
had the wrong interest section. Northwest 25th Street and 87 Avenue in D'Areal,

[01:18:37.140 --> 01:18:41.260]
which quite frankly, I have no idea where that particular joint is.

[01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:47.400]
At the shell station, man, it's at the shell station. So who do we believe? Do we believe

[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:50.800]
Miguel who emailed me yesterday? He tried to give me the list and the Howard for free,

[01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:54.180]
which I couldn't do it anyway. And I don't want to hear it. And, D'Aird, we believe this collar,

[01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:59.220]
who just called us an O'Jaham Provacateur Julio. Who do we believe? We need a third. I think

[01:18:59.220 --> 01:19:05.020]
they're both full of crap. Yeah, we need a tiebreaker. Hear it ought to be on line nine QAM. Hello.

[01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:12.120]
How like killer spot for you on it on there. WQAM. Hello. Hey, he likes sun. Pretty good.

[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:16.340]
I was listening to a David Lee Roth show this morning. I think it's pretty good. I think it's

[01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:21.220]
better than how it's done. I can be believable. Really? Yeah, he's pretty good. He's got

[01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:26.240]
a fresh new idea. And he tells you about the rock and roll industry and other topics that's

[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:30.640]
instead of looking at boobs and butt. Yeah. And you didn't have Robin doing the news on there?

[01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:33.980]
Right. Right. That's boring stuff. Anything else, Robin?

[01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:38.680]
Okay, thanks, Bob. I'm glad you're on. Stay on for long.

[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:42.160]
So I'm up 100 years. So until I croak, man, I'm going to croak right on the air. I got it all

[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:47.920]
planned out. 567.0560, pound 566 in the Verizon. Yeah, I'm very jealous. I would like to be on

[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:52.840]
not serious. I'd like to be syndicated. Forget about serious. Because you know, when you really stop

[01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:57.760]
and think about it, they're narrow-cased. And they're talking to a few people, a fraction of his

[01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:01.260]
original audience. And like this guy, the guy, two calls ago said, or three, whatever it was,

[01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:04.580]
he spent all of that money and then come to find out they're going to be running commercials

[01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:08.340]
based on a lie. It was going to be commercial free. Well, guess what?

[01:20:10.780 --> 01:20:17.840]
WQAM. Hello. Hey, hey. Yes. Okay. I just wanted to make a comment about Pat Robertson

[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:19.640]
and Howard Stern. Okay.

[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:24.820]
How come Pat Robertson isn't in on that Supreme Court thing since he's so close to God,

[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:31.540]
and knows him so well? And then, now I'm just saying, I think he's the EICM gutter days,

[01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:37.580]
just like the last year of Flying South, what really started to suck. It was a great show,

[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:43.660]
and it just ran out of steam and it didn't die out great of the way. And I think that's what happened

[01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:46.860]
to Howard Stern. Okay. So thanks, Pat.

[01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:50.600]
Pat Robertson's got better hair though. Yes. Thanks.

[01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:55.140]
5.670, he does, doesn't he? Better than that.

[01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:59.560]
He's got lovely hair. He's got a nice dew. He looks like a real, like the definitive

[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:05.540]
goy. He uses Dippity-Doo. WQAM. Hello. QAM.

[01:21:06.580 --> 01:21:10.820]
Yeah, let's pick a meal. Speaking. Oh, Dukkrat Dukkrat, Longamagiyat.

[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:18.940]
I want to speak to Neil, and then that's the material. Very, very beautiful, beautifully done.

[01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:28.900]
Guess what? WQAM. Hello. Hey, how you doing? Okay. Hey, I've bought a serious radio. Got one

[01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:33.520]
on my trot. Got one on my work. I pay for it. My tip got to hear all kinds of words.

[01:21:34.540 --> 01:21:39.320]
And I could couldn't hear it before. I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it. I got there some fart noises,

[01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:43.140]
but miss those. And everybody needs those. So it was where it's worth it.

[01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:47.820]
And there's still a music. There's a guy that's happy. Well, I'm happy for you.

[01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:55.140]
All right. Fire it up. There you go. He's got no complaints. Well, I only took an hour and 40 minutes

[01:21:55.140 --> 01:22:03.240]
to find one. But it was worth it, right? What? Hey, listen, what have I always told you about these

[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:09.800]
calls? You might have to go through 20, 30, 40,000. Maybe I'm exaggerating. Maybe you'll get a classic.

[01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:15.340]
You'll get some good crap. Okay. You just don't have the perspicacity and the tenacity. What

[01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:20.860]
of those were? What did it all? What does that mean? I don't know. Because you give up too easy.

[01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:25.500]
Only when I'm on though. I give up. When I'm on, you want me to read the stupid crap, right?

[01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:31.100]
What's your number one answer to this? Most people are stupid. See? Stupid. If most people are stupid,

[01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:36.680]
then I guess I should read some stupid crap. 46. What's that kind of deal again? Sol,

[01:22:36.900 --> 01:22:43.100]
we're been in with A-hole, 32. Now, maybe that way we got Joe Bellas, the GM will get our fart sounds

[01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:47.180]
back. What do you think? Well, you can act. Because I know when I talk to him, whenever that's

[01:22:47.180 --> 01:22:51.240]
going to be, he's probably going to say, well, is there anything I can do for you? Yeah,

[01:22:51.260 --> 01:22:55.240]
there's only one thing. Well, two things. First of all, kill all the salespeople. And number two,

[01:22:55.680 --> 01:23:01.040]
give us our fart sounds back. Get on the room with that. Joyce and tell that bitch what for. Okay.

[01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:05.560]
That's some of the preschool words we're not allowed to say. Such an answer. I like to be bagged.

[01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:10.140]
That's what in that one, right? Yeah. Like, Halloween devise. Say on primetime kids shows that we

[01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:16.060]
can't say. Right. Most people A-hole, 32. Hippocrates, 29. Decent, 19. Well, that's pretty decent,

[01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:22.040]
Navier. One dimensional 10, reasonable nine, big hits three, perverts to ugly, two, lifeless,

[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:27.480]
one, Solomon Tehono and jerks one. Well, it seems to be like a little slop over there with some of those.

[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:34.860]
Am I right? I'm like A-hole and jerk. Where's the fine line? Can you be a jerk without being

[01:23:34.860 --> 01:23:39.660]
an A-hole? I don't think so. Now, maybe you can be an A-hole without being a jerk. Think about that.

[01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:44.000]
It's going to make my head hurt. Maybe you can be an idiotic jerk. I sure wish I had that

[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:48.440]
birch to enter thing. If you're a lot of feed it up to you. Where are you? Reminding. Maybe tomorrow morning.

[01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:52.080]
I'm right here, confangulating. When the salespeople are coming in and trying to course me into doing

[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:55.900]
stuff I don't want to do. I write down idiotic jerk. Give us an audio salespeople are Q-A-M. You go

[01:23:55.900 --> 01:24:02.080]
out and sell it. I'll do it. Okay. I don't care if I'm endorsing like, you know, whatever it is.

[01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:09.120]
Airlines with blind pilots. I mean, whatever it is, I'll do it. Right? Right. Because we need

[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:12.620]
the money. The beesleys need the money. We'll ban our leases up. We're moving on down to the

[01:24:12.620 --> 01:24:18.000]
kiss building. We're kissing it. We're the ghost of Paxen is hovering over. God, those were really

[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.660]
some days going into that building. There was a very strange environment in there.

[01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:27.440]
Remember the day we got the tour of that building? Yep. And there was that WACC that,

[01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:31.540]
in those beginning glades, little, it was like a radio station and a broom closet. It was like in

[01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:36.180]
the bowels of the building. Yeah. Like, oh, there's our Spanish language station. WACC, it was like

[01:24:36.180 --> 01:24:42.400]
two holy, oh, sitting in an closet. Which, of course, so many are. Hey, the animal coast is still

[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:46.000]
thought as number one. Asian girl may be fade. That's not just my personal opinion, but that's

[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.460]
a coin to get restaurant review and they really know their stuff. Now every Friday through Sunday

[01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:54.620]
night, you can enjoy lobster fest, featuring main lobster served thermator style. And every night

[01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:59.240]
is crab festival with a lot of Alaskan snow crab legs, dungeon is crab and Jonas stone crabs.

[01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:03.720]
The menu with the animal coast includes fresh oysters on a half shell and a sushi bar with over

[01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:08.280]
30, but 30 men with an items. The animal coast also served New York steaks, cooked away a

[01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:12.560]
like a rotender in juicy handcar prime ribbon on the weekends for dessert, leave room for their

[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:17.080]
sensational 40 inch chocolate fountain. God only knows the kinds of things you can stick in that

[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:20.960]
baby. You can end it here on strawberries, marshmallows, other decadent treats. And don't forget

[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:25.380]
the animal coast promotes healthy living too. They cook all their fine cuisine only with cholesterol

[01:25:25.380 --> 01:25:31.020]
free canola oil, no MSG, no cornstarch, no headaches, no crab. So book your reservations for a real

[01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:35.860]
fantastic feast at one of animal coast relocations. There are some rice and ails, beach and temper pies

[01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:47.360]

[01:28:49.040 --> 01:29:17.180]
Oh the van is still there we have a lot of passes and I quote how much did they give it any away? I don't know we have a lot of passes see every quite every question that I ask is they didn't say I don't know or I guess is this idiot is this invasible capable of communication over there can he tell you we've given away a whole bunch of them but we still have a lot more we've got like hundreds we're gonna get that guy's number like a flunky we'll just call him directly how's that no I think we got to give it out on a year

[01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:23.820]
oh no seriously because maybe the audience can find out what else going on over there you know

[01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:32.040]
this is pathetic this is so typical man the way things have degenerated this radio station just tragic thank

[01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:39.120]
God we made this move just in time I can hear Tony Bennett singing it right now if Miguel would spend more time

[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:43.260]
the less time worrying about do I want to hear Howard Stewart on serious and more time worried about if

[01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:46.980]
we knew what that was going on with our promotions maybe we get something I can't wait for that best

[01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:51.700]
and the other thing to go on oh that's going to go down big like eating the whole pizza without taking

[01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:59.380]
a bite it's going to go down big WDQ way and hello I don't know okay hey I don't know if you

[01:29:59.380 --> 01:30:04.220]
saw that interview with probably not because you don't watch thoughts but whatever let's

[01:30:04.220 --> 01:30:09.640]
create an and how Dean no blitzkrieg was trying to I'll first go look let's create his not Fox

[01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:17.520]
what's the not Fox I saw well blitzkrieg he's on CNN I'm sorry you're right CNN I thought clip

[01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:23.760]
the same difference yeah well same crap anyway he was trying to tie both was trying to tie the

[01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:28.940]
Democrats to the to the Abramoff nonsense saying that the Democrats had taken some sort of

[01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:34.980]
back stuff and right and so he's going there's absolutely no proof of that because what about

[01:30:34.980 --> 01:30:40.020]
the Indian tribes that we can see that they took payments well you know Abramoff had nothing nothing

[01:30:40.020 --> 01:30:46.320]
to do directly with the with the Indians and they you know there's no proof that I've seen in

[01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:50.940]
all the reports every single person who was arrested every single person who was indicted every

[01:30:50.940 --> 01:30:57.000]
certain person involved is a Republican there is not one Democrat involved in any of this what it

[01:30:57.200 --> 01:31:02.500]
will for taking deep breath and at the end of the interview he just there's like a second pause

[01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:07.380]
where there's no words he just takes a deep breath and says okay well thanks for your time

[01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:13.120]
and you see he just takes a deep breath and he's on camera I don't know what he's thinking

[01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:19.120]
and you know you see him take a sigh okay well thanks for that and Dean start laughing you know he

[01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:23.340]
starts laughing at a two and it's like you can't get it was it was funny it's on the

[01:31:23.340 --> 01:31:27.140]
got a thing the Democratic Party I'm forcing they keep getting stuck in this business about Dean

[01:31:27.140 --> 01:31:31.620]
is a loose cannon and he's out of control Dean is the only one with a ball to tell a like it is

[01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:35.960]
exactly right and that's he's the one they ought to be following man and they would kick some

[01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:40.640]
of you like that stand up and and keep these guys around because they're all pussy foot if I

[01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:45.840]
could say that yeah around you know the only guy that has a pair is the one that's green with

[01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:50.540]
the top of his head and he's the one that he's the one gosh we should have voted for him

[01:31:50.540 --> 01:31:57.260]
Amen Amen thanks how do you like that I told you just like they he came on here on that same obnoxious

[01:31:57.260 --> 01:32:02.760]
talking head network and said the the Tom Ridge was just doing it holes pony a scam with a

[01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:07.400]
terror alert and raising the terror warning it was just a political ploy that's right and I've

[01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:12.260]
heard attention from whatever these scandal doger was at that time and it was it was right and then

[01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:16.700]

it's going to be put a boot put a Monday through Thursday then at 12 15 specter will start the 10

[01:35:02.580 --> 01:35:08.100]
minute opening statements by senators by 20 senators on both sides he starts hands it off to

[01:35:08.100 --> 01:35:11.640]
the top you know this whole thing is so stupid as if I have to tell you that well why why

[01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:16.060]
are the senators have to have opening statements okay so they can do that great other than to

[01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:21.260]
grandstand for their constituents and for the American public why do the senators have to have

[01:35:21.260 --> 01:35:25.660]
opening statements just to give a lot of time as opposed to putting his ass on the fire

[01:35:25.660 --> 01:35:32.120]
this is right oh you guys this is 5.62.8

[01:35:34.100 --> 01:35:38.180]
this is Dick Cheney I like to relax by having their margol and massage my balls while listening

[01:35:38.180 --> 01:35:39.640]
to the Neil Rogers 12th one hour

[01:35:55.660 --> 01:36:02.220]
right

[01:36:09.860 --> 01:36:17.160]
The credit stated in pictures great but I brought along the email me to watch those new photos with those hats

[01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:23.780]
Come to me, we got down to hard cause they hold more feelings than me

[01:36:23.780 --> 01:36:28.540]
They made my noise cause those new branches were red leaves

[01:36:28.540 --> 01:36:34.160]
They couldn't start my game and nobody bothered nothing they were

[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:38.480]
Make it love to a cowboy, everybody's been

[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:41.480]
Make it love to a cowboy

[01:36:42.420 --> 01:36:46.520]
When we're looking for love to all the kind if you want it to wash

[01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:50.540]
The lady behind me stepped for when they started to fall there

[01:36:50.540 --> 01:36:54.700]
They burned down, if you want to get cold right there in the wind

[01:36:54.700 --> 01:36:57.240]
You'll hear the music and hear the growling

[01:36:57.240 --> 01:37:01.420]
Nothing shakes me more than corn and singing the land of horn

[01:37:01.420 --> 01:37:06.560]
Cause they got down on the hard cause they hold more feelings than me

[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:10.980]
They made my noise cause those new branches were red leaves

[01:37:10.980 --> 01:37:16.480]
They couldn't start my game and nobody bothered nothing they were

[01:37:17.100 --> 01:37:21.220]
Make it love to a cowboy, everybody's been

[01:37:21.740 --> 01:37:24.000]
Make it love to a cowboy

[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:24.940]
They're very

[01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:28.760]
Make it love to a cowboy

[01:37:29.220 --> 01:37:31.620]
So both ran chants were randy, how do you like that?

[01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:35.260]
How do you like that? I knew she was much of an up to be one of them, but both

[01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:42.680]
12.02 at 5.60 W.D.Q.A. James Ridgeway writes he's the author of the five unanswered questions about 9.11

[01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:47.780]
He writes Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and 9.11 how much did the Bush administration know

[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:52.540]
And San Antonio over the weekend, oh there's our Bush inspector

[01:37:52.540 --> 01:37:53.760]
I'm an Arlon's inspector

[01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:57.060]
Supreme Court of the United States

[01:37:58.140 --> 01:37:59.860]
A few matters of it

[01:37:59.860 --> 01:38:01.680]
And his hair is growing back, aren't you proud man?

[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:02.740]
Oh yeah I'm proud

[01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:06.280]
And that's because God's rewarding him for being so innovative and coming up with that single bullet

[01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:09.000]
Here in the Kennedy assassination, that magic bullet

[01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:14.440]
In San Antonio over the weekend, the Bush defended the NSA wear type program saying

[01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:16.960]
The attack this before they'll attack us again if they can

[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:20.380]
And they're going to we're going to do everything we can to stop me be saying

[01:38:20.380 --> 01:38:24.500]
To be polite about this, this isn't especially weird statement coming from a president

[01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:29.160]
Who is administration repeatedly ignored one warning after another of an imminent terrorist attack before 9.11

[01:38:29.780 --> 01:38:33.880]
But in fact, it is clearly administration did know we could be attacking any number of ways

[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:36.800]
Including by turning a hijack commercial airliner into a missile

[01:38:37.460 --> 01:38:41.360]
There were at least a dozen warnings from foreign intelligence services of terrorists plans to attack

[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:45.220]
Including some side in the possibility of turning a hijack plan into a suicide missile

[01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:50.060]
Explicit warnings came from British German attacking Egyptian and Jordanian intelligence

[01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:51.600]
And even from Vladimir Putin

[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:57.080]
In July 2001, just two months before 9.11, there were intelligence warnings that the G8 summit in Genoa

[01:38:57.080 --> 01:38:59.700]
Might be attacked by plain stuff with explosives

[01:38:59.700 --> 01:39:03.800]
It's high and official took these threats seriously enough to close the airspace over Genoa

[01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:06.080]
And install anti-aircraft guns all around the city

[01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:10.800]
And bushed out enough of them to choose to stay on a ship off the coast instead of in Genoa

[01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:15.300]
Unfortunately, he thought less about the safety of ordinary Americans they did about his own safety

[01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:21.320]
Donald Rumsfeld told the 9.11 Commission that defense against the tanks on American soil was not the responsibility of the defense

[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:23.420]
But a law enforcement issue

[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:27.820]
Yet there have been no consequences for anybody in the Bush administration or the intelligence community

[01:39:27.820 --> 01:39:32.140]
Rumsfeld should have been fired after 9.11 along with the top leadership at the CIA and FBI

[01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:37.420]
Instead, the intelligence agencies were rewarded with an increase in funding estimated at 30 percent

[01:39:37.420 --> 01:39:38.480]
About 30 men

[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:41.380]
And a freehand to torture prisoners and spy on American citizens

[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:45.760]
And Rumsfeld was given what he wanted all along which was a war with Iraq

[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:48.420]
Tenant was awarded the Medal of Freedom on his retirement

[01:39:49.220 --> 01:39:53.240]
9.11 represented to be trailed by two of America's allies Pakistan and Saudi Arabia

[01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:58.360]
Through its powerful intelligence service Pakistan basically created the Taliban and Afghanistan

[01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:01.480]
And its agents stationed around that country cooperated with Al Qaeda

[01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:03.680]
It ignored the Taliban's support of Al Qaeda

[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:08.460]
There's little doubt that members of Pakistani intelligence knew that 9.11 was going to happen including the details

[01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:14.600]
But today Pakistan is our best friend in the region receiving a significant increase in USAID so don't go there

[01:40:15.140 --> 01:40:19.140]
The Pakistani rule in all of this pales in comparison to the involvement of Saudi Arabia

[01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:22.200]
Saudis are clearly the major funding source for Al Qaeda

[01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:24.780]
In fact, the person who up-create Al Qaeda was Prince Turkey

[01:40:24.780 --> 01:40:27.340]
Who at the time was the head of the Saudi intelligence

[01:40:27.340 --> 01:40:31.720]
He participated in the recruitment of Osama bin Laden along with other Islamic fundamentalists

[01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:34.380]
To go to Afghanistan in the 80s to fight against the Soviets

[01:40:34.380 --> 01:40:36.880]
And what were the consequences for Prince Turkey?

[01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:40.080]
Last year he was welcomed as the new Saudi ambassador to the USA

[01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:42.040]
Another Turkey

[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:45.760]
Thanks to the courage and quick action of flight attendant support flight 11

[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:48.160]
American Airlines headquarters knew about the first hijacking

[01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:50.080]
No more than 10 minutes after it happened

[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:52.960]
This was before any of the other three planes had been hijacked

[01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:55.980]
It was nearly 20 minutes before flight 93 even left the ground

[01:40:55.980 --> 01:40:59.200]
What would have happened if American Airlines had passed this information on

[01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:00.680]
Instead of keeping it to themselves

[01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:03.820]
Pilots might have been warned to secure their cockpit doors

[01:41:03.820 --> 01:41:06.120]
Plains on the ground might not have taken off

[01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:09.020]
Officials in New York City would have known that the first world-trade tower

[01:41:09.020 --> 01:41:11.880]
Crash was no accident and they might have evacuated the other tower

[01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:13.480]
How many lives could have been saved

[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:16.340]
But what were the consequences for American Airlines negligence?

[01:41:16.580 --> 01:41:19.780]
The official that was in charge in American Airlines headquarters that day

[01:41:19.780 --> 01:41:21.700]
Has been promoted to President of the airline

[01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:26.040]
Along with other carriers, Americans received huge government bailouts since 9-11

[01:41:26.040 --> 01:41:30.180]
And to this day they have an institute of the changes necessary to keep their passengers safe

[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:34.420]
A few months ago, Steve Elson, a member of the FAA's red team

[01:41:34.420 --> 01:41:38.760]
Undercover former special operations people trained to test their security by breaking through it

[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:44.340]
Travel to Toronto where with reporters in tow he picked a loss of all the doors in the Toronto Pearson airport

[01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:47.680]
He thus easily gained access to all baggage handling facilities

[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:52.800]
All the ramps, walkways, cockpits and seats of idled lanes, food, vending trucks and so on

[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:55.080]
It would be a simple matter to plan a bomb on an aircraft

[01:41:55.080 --> 01:41:58.280]
Destined for New York or Washington or LA or wherever

[01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:00.020]
How do you like that? Pretty comforting, eh?

[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:01.800]
Oh yeah, I feel nice and secure now

[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:05.700]
All right, how's that pull coming? He asked

[01:42:07.540 --> 01:42:13.620]
What's it? What are these? Which it's a tough choice? What's your number one answer to? Most people are we got 240 vote

[01:42:14.580 --> 01:42:22.400]
Stupid 74 A holes 47 Pipercrets 40 decent 36 one-dimensional 14 reasonable 14

[01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:26.860]
Lifeless 3 pervert 3 bigots 3 jerks 2 and ugly 2

[01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:30.040]
Or obliterate

[01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:31.700]
Most people are

[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:34.240]
Not ugly, but what would you say?

[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:35.800]
Maybe you're looking at me as

[01:42:37.420 --> 01:42:38.880]
Oh no, Edmius

[01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:42.100]
By the way, if you weren't still dead any Edmius we

[01:42:42.860 --> 01:42:47.480]
Steps to the hearing this we have what took some steps to find out what's going on

[01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:50.440]
We're going to have roll Ian's self-call up after the next break

[01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:53.520]
And we can grind him ourselves

[01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:58.100]
Well, why do we need to do that if we go already giving him the answer? Why do we want to put that

[01:42:58.780 --> 01:43:01.220]
To the minute that you know avoid several middlemen and just

[01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:09.040]
In fact, huh he ain't fat while it really sounds really poorly does but no, it's short for real well for Kranow

[01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:13.820]
A lot of you better get fat. I mean he's really cool. Josh periodically too, but you know

[01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:17.000]
Look we don't have to make that bigger but simmissile when I was just looking for an answer

[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:22.340]
I mean you're once again getting carried away emotional and hysterical right he's hysterical like K

[01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:27.340]
Earn like Connie. I'm sorry excuse me. Don't forget your godfather trivia raw. Oh, no

[01:43:27.340 --> 01:43:32.300]
Don't be mad right now. I'm not reading this anymore. Okay if they wanted it they can go out there

[01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:36.720]
I'm not reading it normal first after what we killed it in the yesterday and what he did to me with that CD business

[01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:43.260]
And you notice how vociferously he denies all of that. Oh, I'm not in sales. I had nothing to do it at right

[01:43:43.260 --> 01:43:46.300]
The sales department just found out about that biosmosis

[01:43:47.620 --> 01:43:50.560]
God and then he tries to blame it on poor duff you fairy

[01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:56.020]
Somebody Q a m. Hello, I'm sorry. Yeah, I've got another one for your poll. Yes

[01:43:56.760 --> 01:43:57.200]
Yeah

[01:43:57.200 --> 01:44:00.480]
I can't believe you had a poll and there was something about

[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:03.940]
Smokers on there and didn't seem like a lot of people answered that

[01:44:03.940 --> 01:44:07.480]
So I think most people are closet stoners

[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:08.520]
Okay

[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:15.700]
Turn that thing up a little bit louder. I love that

[01:44:15.700 --> 01:44:18.600]
There's just something about that whole mentality, you know

[01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:23.340]
Allie he was okay closet stoners is that all right? Very deep. I guess closet something

[01:44:23.340 --> 01:44:28.880]
Unlike George who's out of the closet. That's right. One thing about everybody on this show. They're out of the closet

[01:44:29.620 --> 01:44:31.860]
Josh isn't there was a vibrators and the

[01:44:31.860 --> 01:44:34.900]
George isn't a no that long right

[01:44:35.940 --> 01:44:39.820]
And you know what I'm into five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty

[01:44:39.820 --> 01:44:45.100]
So this movie I saw over the weekend. What that was an invent oh, he's very though. That's a sad part

[01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:46.400]
You know, so Daniel Hirsch

[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:51.500]
Sigurdney weaver was great in that movie imaginary heroes. He was great. Oh, is that the name of it? I'll avoid it

[01:44:51.500 --> 01:44:53.380]
I like her a lot. So why is that?

[01:44:54.180 --> 01:44:56.660]
Is it very morbid? It's depressing. Well, that's why

[01:44:57.260 --> 01:45:02.500]
Huh? I want to see a depressing movie. I've got life for that. Why is it that most of the movies

[01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:07.320]
Um, unless it's a comedy most of the movies are morbid and depressing last many many years

[01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:13.580]
Just the way it goes like Magnolia even. It's a good movie and Requiem and all the movies are very morbid and depressing

[01:45:13.580 --> 01:45:18.260]
Maybe that's why people are throwing their brains out like crazy. You think either that or it's a gas prices

[01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:20.560]
Five you do that or it's a your president

[01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:26.240]
Thank you mr. President for those bargain basement gas prices and the good news is my handyman is he is okay

[01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:30.040]
One of these days after he gets enough beer. Send me he's gonna come back and finish that fence

[01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:35.520]
Don't push it as he just relax. Okay. Just lay there in bed and you know say a few prayers

[01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:39.480]

[01:45:56.540 --> 01:45:56.960]

What do you think about the South Florida? I'm down here from Michigan. I just it sucks. I

[01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:06.560]
Don't care for this day. Yeah, you're right. We're we're Michigan

[01:46:42.020 --> 01:46:45.460]
I mentioned a dick Burton was inducted in the radio hall of fame. Yes, you did

[01:46:45.460 --> 01:46:51.220]
Now I think I'm I'm probably after my 30th anniversary in radio hall of shame when you think they ever heard of you

[01:46:51.220 --> 01:46:52.320]
No, okay

[01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:56.600]
Oh, no, I'm not so one of those things you know, this is a filthy or potty mouth

[01:46:56.600 --> 01:47:01.260]
At least I know you can say crap now we can't even say crap anymore. So I guess it can't be that can't be the issue

[01:47:01.260 --> 01:47:02.220]
You think about it

[01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:06.800]
No, it's a it's a bad show. It's a bad the it's a bad life. It's a bad planet

[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:12.660]
Yeah, we need to start being a lot more negative, you know all I crap that near Rogers is so negative now

[01:47:12.660 --> 01:47:17.120]
I've discovered it's taking me all these years to the reason we could have an 80-year is if I could be a lot more negative

[01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:18.680]
We hate everybody

[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:25.120]
Right, right. That's a soft food effing way maybe negative hostile and

[01:47:26.900 --> 01:47:29.020]
Retardo oh that would be one most people are retarded

[01:47:30.300 --> 01:47:34.220]
Oh, we already got stupid we could no that stupid is one level of it

[01:47:34.220 --> 01:47:36.880]
You know another retarded is more like you know like that

[01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:39.620]
So many of them all over the place

[01:47:40.460 --> 01:47:44.260]
probably I went at Yovon guy came back then and it was gonna be a real winning model boy

[01:47:44.660 --> 01:47:50.000]
The Yovon man moved away and now he's back up to his old. Oh, yeah, when I heard capridis voice and what's the Yovon?

[01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:51.940]
The Yovons and others

[01:47:54.040 --> 01:47:57.600]
Very very sad because one thing about soft food is if the sewage always comes back

[01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:01.700]
You know you know this right well they can dump it out to see it. Just watch us right back up that is correct

[01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:02.920]
Right back up on show

[01:48:03.540 --> 01:48:06.140]

What Irsta should be too easy wins?

[01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:05.020]
Las Vegas style gambling cruises return to Miami's Bayfront Park with Friday's launch of

[01:51:05.020 --> 01:51:11.040]
the SS Horizon's Age run by a Massachusetts-based company, not that evil gambling, oh no, how bad.

[01:51:12.540 --> 01:51:15.440]
A Massachusetts company's bringing back gambling to Miami's waterfront.

[01:51:16.020 --> 01:51:20.300]
Horizon's Age, which promises Las Vegas style gambling during five and six hour cruises,

[01:51:20.700 --> 01:51:22.360]
began sailing Friday from Bayfront Park.

[01:51:23.220 --> 01:51:28.520]
The SS Horizon's Age replaces the Casino Princessa, which operated from Bayfront Park for nine years

[01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:30.180]
before calling it quits in July.

[01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:35.780]
But Horizon's Age of Lynn Nash is likely to face stiff competition elsewhere, especially from seascape entertainment,

[01:51:36.260 --> 01:51:38.680]
which runs a gambling cruise ship out of Fort Everglades.

[01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:43.220]
Horizon's Age, well I tell you, once the slot start in the pyramutials in a couple of months,

[01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:49.320]
those people with those cruise ships better cleaned up real fast, they better keep breaking it in,

[01:51:49.940 --> 01:51:56.280]
raping the public, because once people can actually go on land without going out there and getting seasick and giving their guts out.

[01:51:56.440 --> 01:51:56.860]
What a notion.

[01:51:57.400 --> 01:52:01.920]
Yeah. Horizon's Age will also buy with Seminole Hard Rock Hotel Casino in Hollywood,

[01:52:02.240 --> 01:52:06.000]
where the Humper City had dropped a friend off for a weekend, and the place was just packed.

[01:52:06.360 --> 01:52:11.680]
They were packing it baby, and with the Permutials in Broward County, where voters recently approved slot machines,

[01:52:12.020 --> 01:52:14.780]
and where the legislature and your Fed has scabbard and reluctantly finally signed the bill.

[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:21.360]
David Zion, CEO of Horizon's Edge, said he believes South Florida's gaming market is big enough for another player.

[01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:24.220]
When you're looking at a market as big and growing as Miami,

[01:52:24.560 --> 01:52:27.380]
to try to attract 150,000 people a year, is very attainable, Zion,

[01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:30.000]
said referring to passenger utilities put up by Princessa.

[01:52:30.980 --> 01:52:34.140]
Horizon's Age has an agreement with Miami to operate from Bayfront for the next seven years,

[01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:36.280]
and the same spot is used by Princessa.

[01:52:37.160 --> 01:52:40.720]
The Horizon's Age carries about 500 passengers and for more than 75 people,

[01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:43.340]
it's won a two-game in-ships operated by Horizon's Edge,

[01:52:43.660 --> 01:52:46.680]
the other ship sales, easily from Boston, during the summer's in fall.

[01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:49.520]
When I'm deciding, are you ready to top aboard, plug your guts out?

[01:52:50.880 --> 01:52:51.220]
No.

[01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:55.100]
Oh, and now, how come QIAM Batline?

[01:52:55.980 --> 01:52:57.400]
Yeah, how you doing chief, it's Rowley.

[01:52:57.840 --> 01:52:59.180]
Hey, Rowley, what's going on out there? Nothing?

[01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:02.760]
Dude, I'm gone. That's it. Right out of tickets.

[01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:04.640]
You getting all the way? Yes, sir?

[01:53:04.980 --> 01:53:07.580]
Nice going, Rowley, and I apologize for not being fat, but work on it.

[01:53:07.940 --> 01:53:10.980]
Not talking to the Warren, but I'll make sure I get on top of that.

[01:53:11.260 --> 01:53:12.220]
Okay, I'll bet you will.

[01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:14.920]
Come back to the station, steal some pizza while you're at it.

[01:53:15.020 --> 01:53:15.420]
Yes, sir.

[01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:16.720]
Oh, for me! Thank you, sir.

[01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:17.880]
There's Rowley-Poly.

[01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:20.380]
Don't say that when it's, uh, what?

[01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:22.080]
Well, it's going to be really funny.

[01:53:22.120 --> 01:53:22.480]
It's really funny.

[01:53:22.840 --> 01:53:23.880]
I like that, Rowley-Poly.

[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.040]
What doesn't it, uh, doesn't it figure? Rowley-Poly?

[01:53:26.380 --> 01:53:26.380]

[01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:27.760]
How many Rowley's do you know?

[01:53:27.900 --> 01:53:29.820]
I know Rowley fingers, but you're not a baseball guy.

[01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:30.680]
He was, he was skinny.

[01:53:31.560 --> 01:53:34.440]
He was the great relief pitcher for the Oakland A's with a big handlebar mustache.

[01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:36.260]
You've actually even charged me, I heard Rowley fingers.

[01:53:36.520 --> 01:53:37.400]
No, who's he?

[01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:38.000]
Of course.

[01:53:39.580 --> 01:53:41.040]
Oh, don't kill me, there's a course.

[01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:43.840]
I've mentioned people to you and you're like, uh-huh, who's that?

[01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:46.600]
Yeah, like that made up person that I looked up and it was no such person.

[01:53:46.740 --> 01:53:47.260]
Who's that?

[01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:48.620]
I'm not yet a member.

[01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:49.340]
This is why I'm here.

[01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:49.580]
I'm a Schmender.

[01:53:49.720 --> 01:53:51.060]
He was my next door in April, man.

[01:53:51.060 --> 01:53:51.320]
I met him.

[01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:53.000]
I'm a Schmender with my ass.

[01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:56.360]
You better get with your Jews.

[01:53:56.560 --> 01:53:57.900]
You should don't know your Jews, man.

[01:53:58.560 --> 01:53:59.800]
Just like that Mickey Mendel.

[01:54:01.020 --> 01:54:02.880]
You better start to hop it on top of it.

[01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:05.280]
So we gave away all the tickets, five, took a hell of a lot of effort.

[01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:08.040]
And that's because Stern probably went on to about 1130.

[01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:10.100]
So we had no audience, 1130.

[01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:13.420]
Now we're getting a bunch of spy reports on that great Stern debut on the series.

[01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:16.780]
Not that I really care what we're with the other, but just after all of that hype,

[01:54:16.780 --> 01:54:18.200]
you think that you get something, wouldn't you?

[01:54:19.040 --> 01:54:19.220]
Something.

[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.280]
I mean, who's giving out $100 bills in every street corner?

[01:54:22.380 --> 01:54:23.020]
Nobody showed up.

[01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:24.100]
We'd have to say, hey, guess what?

[01:54:24.180 --> 01:54:25.180]
We got no audience, man.

[01:54:26.340 --> 01:54:31.580]
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60, pound five, 60, and they've Verizon and Singular Wireless Line

[01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:33.100]
on the Steel Rogers Show.

[01:54:33.860 --> 01:54:34.460]
WCYM Hello.

[01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:36.720]
This is a clavistic hero.

[01:54:37.980 --> 01:54:38.580]
WCYM Hello.

[01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:39.640]
This is Howard Stern.

[01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:42.060]
And our last call, QAM Hello.

[01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:45.500]
And that's it.

[01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:48.420]
Boy, if you'd have told me this, I'd have stayed in bed.

[01:54:49.820 --> 01:54:51.120]
I'd have taken a couple of weeks off.

[01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:53.220]
Well, I wouldn't have told you if I had known, but I never...

[01:54:53.220 --> 01:54:55.620]
I just usually have like a little premonition, a little something.

[01:54:55.980 --> 01:54:56.240]
Nothing.

[01:54:56.460 --> 01:54:56.680]
Nothing?

[01:54:56.860 --> 01:54:57.460]
Not even a twitch.

[01:54:57.600 --> 01:54:58.640]
Nothing could have shocked me more.

[01:54:58.640 --> 01:55:01.560]
Last chance for calls, baby, are last to plea.

[01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:04.580]
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60, pound five, 60.

[01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:07.800]
They're upset because they didn't pay periods, so kick down against Jacksonville Saturday.

[01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:09.720]
They just walked all over.

[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:11.940]
Man, they hung around the first half.

[01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:14.520]
Let them stay in the game, and then they came out in a second,

[01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:15.720]
I haven't just obliterated them.

[01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:20.660]
Oh, yeah, but the dolphins beat your patriots the week before, Neola.

[01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:22.680]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ho.

[01:55:23.540 --> 01:55:28.000]
Is there any doubt that if the Brady and the First Ring would have even played just the second quarter,

[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.320]
forget about the second half, then they would have kicked their ass.

[01:55:30.940 --> 01:55:32.080]
Is there any doubt about that?

[01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:32.600]

[01:55:33.340 --> 01:55:34.520]
Zero, zip it, he do, duh.

[01:55:35.340 --> 01:55:37.660]
Not that Dolatrix tanked the game or anything like that,

[01:55:37.780 --> 01:55:40.780]
because an upstanding guy like him wouldn't do that, wouldn't be strategizing

[01:55:40.780 --> 01:55:43.500]
to try to start to play off-run with a against the girls team.

[01:55:43.900 --> 01:55:48.580]
To win their tenth consecutive playoff start, an all-time record, and Tom Brady, ten for ten.

[01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:51.640]
Boy, did he look good, and he played pretty good too.

[01:55:52.700 --> 01:55:53.620]
Somebody QA in, hello?

[01:55:54.740 --> 01:55:55.240]
Hey, Dale.

[01:55:55.720 --> 01:55:56.000]
Yes, sir.

[01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:57.540]
You know, Stern is Stern.

[01:55:57.760 --> 01:55:58.380]
I love him.

[01:55:58.540 --> 01:56:01.760]
You know, I listen to him, I have a series of that, I've probably heard.

[01:56:01.780 --> 01:56:04.560]
But dude, at ten o'clock, come on, I come to you, you know that.

[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:05.740]
Thank God for that.

[01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:08.020]
I'm not worried about that.

[01:56:08.120 --> 01:56:11.240]
I'm just curious after all the hype, what the big deal of the opening show did.

[01:56:11.240 --> 01:56:14.420]
It was a normal show with that word, how's that?

[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:15.260]
Okay.

[01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:20.020]
It was a normal show with that word, and he went off the air, I say it was around 1115.

[01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:20.940]
Wow.

[01:56:21.320 --> 01:56:23.020]
But you're always in my heart, you know, alright buddy?

[01:56:23.180 --> 01:56:24.060]
Thank God for that, man.

[01:56:24.060 --> 01:56:25.680]
That's why I had that heartburn, thanks, Kelly.

[01:56:25.900 --> 01:56:26.400]
See ya.

[01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:26.740]
See ya.

[01:56:27.060 --> 01:56:28.020]
Take a couple of roll aids.

[01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:29.440]
WDQA M, hello?

[01:56:30.100 --> 01:56:32.140]
My boss is...

[01:56:32.140 --> 01:56:33.260]
WDQA M, hello.

[01:56:33.660 --> 01:56:34.300]
Thank God for that.

[01:56:34.760 --> 01:56:37.580]
Yeah, me, I was wondering, how's that weed up in Canada?

[01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:41.220]
Oh man, the best, you can smell in the air, just walk outside and you can sniff it.

[01:56:41.860 --> 01:56:43.380]
The aroma will put you in a coma.

[01:56:43.940 --> 01:56:44.280]
It's great.

[01:56:46.940 --> 01:56:48.540]
5670560, how's the weed up in Canada?

[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:49.960]
Oh man, how is it?

[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:52.100]
Okay, I just got through sand.

[01:56:52.100 --> 01:56:54.400]
Well, if you get off your lazy ass and come on up here, eh?

[01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:56.360]
I'm gonna be sneaking across the border again.

[01:56:57.180 --> 01:57:01.820]
Well, that's right, you can't do too much intercontinental traveling that has stopped me before.

[01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:03.800]
Inter-border travel.

[01:57:04.180 --> 01:57:04.940]
What do you mean by that?

[01:57:05.020 --> 01:57:05.740]
You don't have a passport?

[01:57:06.300 --> 01:57:06.620]
No.

[01:57:08.240 --> 01:57:10.200]
You can't get a passport, is that what you're saying?

[01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:11.200]
No, that's not what I said.

[01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:11.620]
Oh.

[01:57:11.800 --> 01:57:13.160]
I don't have a passport.

[01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:13.940]
Well, why not?

[01:57:14.460 --> 01:57:14.780]
Lazy?

[01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:15.640]
Didn't you just say that?

[01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:20.320]
Well, I thought it had something to do with your status as an illegal...

[01:57:20.320 --> 01:57:20.640]
No.

[01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:22.040]
Illegal Cuban.

[01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:23.160]
Right.

[01:57:23.740 --> 01:57:24.600]
No, that's seriously.

[01:57:24.740 --> 01:57:26.420]
You're just gonna have a passport because you're lazy?

[01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:27.720]
Like everybody else that I know?

[01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:28.480]
That's it.

[01:57:29.260 --> 01:57:31.920]
Oh my God, I don't understand the illegal delis.

[01:57:32.080 --> 01:57:33.540]
What would I do if the passport anyway goes through?

[01:57:33.540 --> 01:57:37.620]
I think you're afraid to go into foreign countries with an orspanian race like Mexico and Canada.

[01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:39.220]
I'm afraid to buy a plane ticket, I can't afford.

[01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:41.200]
But I speak those languages, you don't understand.

[01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:43.260]
Although I think that Mexico, I'm with you on that.

[01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:44.640]
I wouldn't go there if you paid me.

[01:57:44.940 --> 01:57:47.000]
No, seriously, if you gave me 50 grand, I would not buy a much ticket.

[01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:49.500]
Somebody to QYM, hello?

[01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:50.620]
Joyce Coppantel?

[01:57:50.800 --> 01:57:52.620]
Jesus, talk about how to control today.

[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:53.360]
QYM, hello.

[01:57:53.620 --> 01:57:55.240]
Hey, hey, Tom Brady, the pillow fighter.

[01:57:56.160 --> 01:57:57.320]
Somebody to QYM, hello?

[01:57:58.300 --> 01:57:59.000]
Here, come on.

[01:57:59.000 --> 01:57:59.500]
Here, come on.

[01:58:01.980 --> 01:58:02.680]
QYM, hello?

[01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:03.800]
Hey, how's your gun?

[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.320]
Did you catch Howard Stern on Larry King last night?

[01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:07.180]
No.

[01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:10.820]
It was the worst suck up job King has ever done.

[01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:12.660]
Well, that covers a lot of territory, baby.

[01:58:13.040 --> 01:58:14.440]
I saw four minutes of it on Wednesday.

[01:58:14.500 --> 01:58:14.960]
It was a repeat.

[01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:19.960]
Hey, listen, that's what everybody's talking about right now.

[01:58:20.100 --> 01:58:21.560]
So Larry's got to be there sucking around.

[01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:24.360]
You know, here's the suction and snack on him, suspenders.

[01:58:24.580 --> 01:58:25.400]
Hey, Howard, you're great.

[01:58:25.580 --> 01:58:26.600]
Howard debuts on serious.

[01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:27.540]
Howard, it's Howard.

[01:58:27.720 --> 01:58:28.000]
It's Howard.

[01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:32.740]
And then a couple of the, you know, few days we'll be talking about how it is disgusting and the pornographic.

[01:58:34.100 --> 01:58:35.320]
What is the Alito hearings?

[01:58:35.500 --> 01:58:41.180]
Same court justice who can demonstrate to he or she would obviously be holding the party.

[01:58:41.180 --> 01:58:45.740]
Leahy from, hey, I like Dick Sandi said, FU Pat, where do you say go FU?

[01:58:45.740 --> 01:58:50.960]
So one of those deals come to the price and pressure from the extreme right of his party by the drawing Harriet Myers.

[01:58:52.400 --> 01:59:00.940]
And by the drawing her nomination, substitute, and this one, the president has allowed his choice to be vetoed by an extreme faction within his party before even a hearing or a vote.

[01:59:02.680 --> 01:59:05.300]
Frankly, that was an eye opening experience.

[01:59:05.300 --> 01:59:06.800]
It's like a look on Alito's face, man.

[01:59:06.920 --> 01:59:08.800]
Looks like somebody just farted real bad next to me.

[01:59:08.800 --> 01:59:09.940]
He's got that real sour look.

[01:59:10.140 --> 01:59:10.540]
Oh, man.

[01:59:11.360 --> 01:59:14.540]
I'm going to tell you, they're going to give him a grilling that even George Foreman would be proud of.

[01:59:14.600 --> 01:59:16.680]
They're going to stick his ass in the lean mean grilling machine.

[01:59:16.860 --> 01:59:17.980]
And then what confirm them anyway?

[01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:18.680]
Probably.

[01:59:20.120 --> 01:59:21.440]
27 past noon in a QA.

[01:59:21.440 --> 01:59:24.920]
When you're shopping for shoes, there's a place I've been telling you about for a long time.

[01:59:25.060 --> 01:59:25.720]
And why do you are smart?

[01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:27.760]
You got smart and you went through to buy your shoes all the time.

[01:59:27.880 --> 01:59:28.800]
Brandies and pompano beef.

[01:59:29.140 --> 01:59:30.780]
And so many reasons to shop at Brandies.

[01:59:30.920 --> 01:59:34.720]
Price, value, comfort, style, selection, all of these things.

[01:59:35.340 --> 01:59:42.160]
Brandies carries a humongous, unbeatable selection of all the major brands like Rockport, Floreshime, Echo, Mephisto, SAS, New Balance.

[01:59:42.320 --> 01:59:43.160]
You love them, they got them.

[01:59:43.540 --> 01:59:47.460]
And Brandies, professional shuffters, I'll make sure you've got to customize video favorite comforts you every time.

[01:59:47.560 --> 01:59:48.240]
Just ask for Arnie.

[01:59:48.600 --> 01:59:50.160]
He'll take care of your tutsies properly.

[01:59:50.720 --> 01:59:53.140]
And the pros at Brandies really understand, fit and comfort.

[01:59:53.280 --> 01:59:55.260]
They even specialize in wide wits as well.

[01:59:55.520 --> 01:59:57.440]
You know, as you get older, your feet get fatter too.

[01:59:58.180 --> 01:59:59.600]
You get fatter and so do your feet.

[01:59:59.860 --> 02:00:00.140]
Trust me.

[02:00:00.200 --> 02:00:00.880]
I told you that already.

[02:00:00.880 --> 02:00:01.160]
Did I?

[02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:02.620]
Well, I know.

[02:00:03.020 --> 02:00:06.940]
Brandies is worth a trip from just about anywhere in town for comfort, style, fit, value, and selection.

[02:00:06.940 --> 02:00:10.380]
It's Brandy shoes, 1290, or federal highway and popular.

[02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:12.860]
Brandies is open daily Monday through Saturday till 9.

[02:00:13.180 --> 02:00:14.400]
Even every Sunday till 5.

[02:00:14.460 --> 02:00:18.480]
And this week is a stupendous time to buy fantastic Rockport shoes at Brandies.

[02:00:18.720 --> 02:00:22.000]
Visit Brandies today and take 10 to 20 bucks off their great Rockport selection.

[02:00:22.120 --> 02:00:25.500]
Only this week and only at Brandy shoes and pompano beef.

[02:00:26.180 --> 02:00:28.060]
This is Neil Rogers.

[02:00:49.380 --> 02:00:55.900]
This is 5.62.8.

[02:00:58.060 --> 02:01:00.760]
You turn and call me wet.

[02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:05.720]
I'm signing off the end.

[02:01:06.700 --> 02:01:07.380]
That's what you think.

[02:01:19.940 --> 02:01:24.060]
I lost it in my life loving you.

[02:01:24.160 --> 02:01:28.820]
You're bright, you're all really good for two.

[02:01:29.940 --> 02:01:34.180]
And with time today's thousandth round.

[02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:39.100]
I wanna go where the living is to be.

[02:01:49.900 --> 02:01:54.140]
I'm the greatest of my life in the song.

[02:01:54.580 --> 02:02:01.480]
Only where even we all can have fun like my running from me.

[02:02:02.140 --> 02:02:05.940]
On those thorns and rays I wanna die.

[02:02:05.940 --> 02:02:17.840]
I'm the greatest of my life in the song.

[02:02:38.740 --> 02:02:43.380]
I wanna sing my love in you.

[02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:48.580]
Live tight for the long, free the Lord of two.

[02:02:49.180 --> 02:02:53.360]
And with time today's thousandth round.

[02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:58.260]
I wanna go where the living is to be.

[02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:00.540]
I wanna die.

[02:03:04.420 --> 02:03:06.220]
That's what that's about to do.

[02:03:07.260 --> 02:03:11.760]
I wanna go where the living is to be.

[02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:19.560]
I wanna go where the living is to be.

[02:03:19.560 --> 02:03:26.520]
I wanna go where the living is to be.

[02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:29.240]
And you picked the perfect place.

[02:03:29.360 --> 02:03:33.300]
And with the young can have no fun.

[02:03:34.980 --> 02:03:36.220]
26 till 1.

[02:03:37.160 --> 02:03:40.360]
What was the movie with Harvey Firestein?

[02:03:44.040 --> 02:03:47.200]
When we all go to Florida to die.

[02:03:49.260 --> 02:03:52.220]
I thought you did see it.

[02:03:52.880 --> 02:03:54.220]
It's often quoted.

[02:03:58.040 --> 02:04:00.360]
I'll tell you one thing that adopted son.

[02:04:04.200 --> 02:04:06.020]
She is so great.

[02:04:09.500 --> 02:04:11.460]
Please don't tell me that she died.

[02:04:14.320 --> 02:04:16.400]
I'll have to look at it.

[02:04:16.680 --> 02:04:18.320]
And she did die.

[02:04:18.620 --> 02:04:19.080]
That's right.

[02:04:21.920 --> 02:04:23.100]
And I was the end.

[02:04:24.380 --> 02:04:26.760]
Anyway, the movie was malice with Alex Baldwin.

[02:04:29.100 --> 02:04:30.360]
I will say this.

[02:04:30.600 --> 02:04:31.780]
I said it a few months ago.

[02:04:32.580 --> 02:04:35.380]
I think I held it against it because of the Tom Cruise connection.

[02:04:36.560 --> 02:04:38.580]
But she's a damn good actress.

[02:04:38.920 --> 02:04:42.040]
The movie sucked.

[02:04:42.220 --> 02:04:43.020]
It was a horrible movie.

[02:04:46.380 --> 02:04:48.180]
George C Scott was in it.

[02:04:48.680 --> 02:04:51.640]
I know he died.

[02:04:51.880 --> 02:04:52.900]
The movie was 93.

[02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:57.940]
He must have died shortly after.

[02:04:58.160 --> 02:04:59.560]
He's been dead for several years now.

[02:05:00.780 --> 02:05:02.960]
Talk about a man with a gigantic ego.

[02:05:04.020 --> 02:05:05.260]
He was a good actor.

[02:05:05.940 --> 02:05:06.880]
He was a little bit overrated.

[02:05:10.020 --> 02:05:12.040]
People are going to say, how about Patton?

[02:05:32.520 --> 02:05:33.420]
He was a good guy.

[02:05:33.540 --> 02:05:33.540]

[02:05:33.540 --> 02:05:33.540]

[02:05:33.540 --> 02:05:33.540]

[02:05:33.540 --> 02:05:33.540]

[02:05:33.540 --> 02:05:33.620]
He was a good guy.

[02:05:34.440 --> 02:05:35.220]
He was a good guy.

[02:05:35.900 --> 02:05:36.640]
He was a good guy.

[02:05:37.760 --> 02:05:39.480]
He was a good guy.

[02:05:47.880 --> 02:05:50.840]
He was a good guy.

[02:05:50.920 --> 02:05:50.920]

[02:05:50.920 --> 02:05:50.920]

[02:05:50.920 --> 02:05:50.920]

[02:05:50.920 --> 02:05:50.920]

[02:05:50.920 --> 02:05:50.920]

[02:05:50.920 --> 02:05:52.560]
He was a good guy.

[02:05:52.560 --> 02:05:56.320]
He was a good guy.

[02:05:56.380 --> 02:06:09.460]
He was a good guy.

[02:06:24.860 --> 02:06:28.540]
He was a good guy.

[02:06:29.320 --> 02:06:29.340]
He was a good guy.

[02:06:29.340 --> 02:06:29.340]

[02:06:29.340 --> 02:06:29.340]

[02:06:29.340 --> 02:06:29.340]

[02:06:29.420 --> 02:06:29.760]
He was a good guy.

[02:06:30.240 --> 02:06:31.580]
He was a good guy.

[02:06:31.720 --> 02:06:32.080]
He was a good guy.

[02:06:32.640 --> 02:06:38.040]
He was a good guy.

[02:06:43.940 --> 02:06:52.600]
He was a good guy.

[02:06:52.600 --> 02:06:52.620]
He was a good guy.

[02:06:52.620 --> 02:06:52.620]

[02:06:52.620 --> 02:06:52.620]

[02:06:52.620 --> 02:06:52.620]

[02:06:52.620 --> 02:06:52.620]

[02:06:52.620 --> 02:06:53.880]
He was a good guy.

[02:06:53.960 --> 02:06:57.060]
He was a good guy.

[02:06:57.560 --> 02:07:08.020]
He was a good guy.

[02:07:12.340 --> 02:07:14.780]
He was a good guy.

[02:07:14.780 --> 02:07:15.440]
He was a good guy.

[02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:15.440]

[02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:15.440]

[02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:15.480]
He was a good guy.

[02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:15.880]
He was a good guy.

[02:07:15.880 --> 02:07:18.280]
He was a good guy.

[02:07:20.740 --> 02:07:24.020]
He was a good guy.

[02:07:26.820 --> 02:07:38.000]
He was a good guy.

[02:07:39.480 --> 02:07:42.580]
He was a good guy.

[02:07:45.420 --> 02:07:46.860]
He was a good guy.

[02:07:46.860 --> 02:07:46.860]

[02:07:46.860 --> 02:07:46.860]

[02:07:46.860 --> 02:07:46.860]

[02:07:46.860 --> 02:07:46.860]

[02:07:46.860 --> 02:07:47.460]
He was a good guy.

[02:07:47.460 --> 02:07:48.880]
He was a good guy.

[02:07:48.880 --> 02:07:53.640]
He was a good guy.

[02:07:54.540 --> 02:08:07.980]
He was a good guy.

[02:08:07.980 --> 02:08:07.980]

[02:08:07.980 --> 02:08:07.980]

[02:08:07.980 --> 02:08:07.980]

[02:08:07.980 --> 02:08:07.980]

[02:08:07.980 --> 02:08:07.980]

[02:08:07.980 --> 02:08:09.860]
It's a pursuing the thinking of the ends for which our entire

[02:08:09.860 --> 02:08:11.080]
legal system

[02:08:11.080 --> 02:08:12.560]
work exists.

[02:08:14.120 --> 02:08:15.300]
As we have seen from

[02:08:15.300 --> 02:08:17.140]
Justice O種 Nos example,

[02:08:18.380 --> 02:08:19.760]
An even one justice

[02:08:19.760 --> 02:08:21.620]
can profoundly

[02:08:21.620 --> 02:08:24.440]
All for the meaning of those words.

[02:08:24.540 --> 02:08:25.360]
Popping our opinions.

[02:08:26.540 --> 02:08:32.340]
Even one justice can deeply affect the rights and liberties of the American people.

[02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:38.840]
Even one justice can advance or reverse the progress of our journey.

[02:08:39.620 --> 02:08:46.300]
So the question before us in these hearings is this, does Judge Alito's record hold true

[02:08:46.300 --> 02:08:49.480]
to the letter and the spirit of equal justice?

[02:08:49.780 --> 02:08:49.920]
No.

[02:08:50.560 --> 02:08:53.540]
Is he committed to the core values of our Constitution?

[02:08:53.880 --> 02:08:54.040]
No.

[02:08:54.560 --> 02:08:56.740]
That are at the heart of our nation's progress.

[02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:57.320]
No.

[02:08:57.600 --> 02:09:02.040]
And can he truly be even handed and fair in his decisions?

[02:09:02.280 --> 02:09:02.420]
No.

[02:09:03.260 --> 02:09:08.740]
In a way, Judge Alito has faced this issue before as a nominee to the Court of Appeals.

[02:09:09.540 --> 02:09:13.260]
I have the privilege of sharing his confirmations here in 1990.

[02:09:14.060 --> 02:09:21.640]
And at that time, he had practiced law for 14 years, but only represented one client, the United States government.

[02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:27.940]
And I asked whether he believed he could be impartial in deciding cases involving the government.

[02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:28.320]
No.

[02:09:28.640 --> 02:09:36.160]
And in that hearing, Judge Alito said on the record that the most important quality for a judge is open-mindedness to the arguments.

[02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:42.440]
And he promised the committee that he would make a very conscious effort to be absolutely impartial.

[02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:44.280]
Don't we want to hear a lot more of this now?

[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:46.300]
Well, I loved Ted Kennedy, man.

[02:09:46.440 --> 02:09:46.660]
He's great.

[02:09:46.740 --> 02:09:48.380]
Too bad he was such a slime ball, but he's great.

[02:09:48.860 --> 02:09:51.540]
In spite of all the redneck right-wingers saying,

[02:09:51.880 --> 02:09:56.680]
here's the fact that he says for your poll, please put a rude as in all of the transplated New Yorkers.

[02:09:56.680 --> 02:10:00.500]
This is the same reason why there's so many mean and miserable people in South Florida in the first place.

[02:10:00.500 --> 02:10:01.260]
Good luck to all of us.

[02:10:01.460 --> 02:10:01.800]
And I agree.

[02:10:01.900 --> 02:10:02.320]
Good luck to you.

[02:10:02.420 --> 02:10:03.340]
You had it on there?

[02:10:03.600 --> 02:10:03.720]
Yeah.

[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:04.800]
From New York.

[02:10:05.320 --> 02:10:05.540]
Yeah.

[02:10:05.540 --> 02:10:06.160]
Rude.

[02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:07.020]
I'm not just loud.

[02:10:07.420 --> 02:10:09.080]
Voicetress, disgusting, overbearing.

[02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:10.500]
Out of control.

[02:10:10.780 --> 02:10:11.660]
Not humans.

[02:10:12.760 --> 02:10:13.880]
Serious typically.

[02:10:14.740 --> 02:10:16.060]
All of these are the same.

[02:10:17.680 --> 02:10:21.960]
The story that rocked on beach in the world.

[02:10:22.480 --> 02:10:25.040]
Uncle Ted did throw on some boxer shorts.

[02:10:25.340 --> 02:10:28.500]
Let's cruise a bar and rage with some babes.

[02:10:28.940 --> 02:10:29.580]
Excellent.

[02:10:30.180 --> 02:10:30.500]
Power.

[02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:31.300]
Money.

[02:10:31.780 --> 02:10:32.100]
Woman.

[02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:34.140]
And who did?

[02:10:34.140 --> 02:10:35.640]
Uncle Ted did.

[02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:40.340]
Let's use our influence on the splash names to impress these babes and do the wall thing.

[02:10:40.720 --> 02:10:41.640]
And the cops out.

[02:10:42.300 --> 02:10:43.260]
No way, Bill.

[02:10:43.860 --> 02:10:44.740]
That's way, Dad.

[02:10:45.540 --> 02:10:46.120]
Excellent.

[02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:47.740]
They're rich.

[02:10:48.020 --> 02:10:48.600]
They're powerful.

[02:10:49.260 --> 02:10:50.480]
They like to swim naked.

[02:10:50.740 --> 02:10:51.740]
Well, you're going to be stint.

[02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:53.060]
Then Ted can't even get in.

[02:10:53.560 --> 02:10:54.300]
They're a tad.

[02:10:54.580 --> 02:10:55.340]
Next for the venture.

[02:10:55.680 --> 02:10:56.200]
Part two.

[02:10:56.600 --> 02:10:57.220]
The next.

[02:10:57.640 --> 02:10:58.220]
Chinataria.

[02:11:00.260 --> 02:11:00.840]
Excellent.

[02:11:01.800 --> 02:11:02.780]
Coming soon.

[02:11:02.780 --> 02:11:04.120]
We're going to be used.

[02:11:04.860 --> 02:11:05.360]
We're going to be used.

[02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:05.560]
We're going to be used.

[02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:06.420]
We're going to be used.

[02:11:06.420 --> 02:11:06.840]
Excellent.

[02:11:07.200 --> 02:11:08.280]
The idea has been turned.

[02:11:09.540 --> 02:11:13.980]
Judges are appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.

[02:11:14.820 --> 02:11:20.560]
And it is our duty to ask questions on great issues that matter to the American people

[02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:23.200]
and to speak for them.

[02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:28.900]
Many Republican senators certainly demanded answers from Harriet Myers.

[02:11:30.040 --> 02:11:33.420]
We should expect no less from Judge Alito.

[02:11:34.180 --> 02:11:36.400]
There is no time for a double standard.

[02:11:37.340 --> 02:11:41.420]
If confirmed Judge Alito could serve on the court for a generation or more,

[02:11:41.840 --> 02:11:43.820]
and the decisions he will make as justice,

[02:11:44.500 --> 02:11:47.860]
will have a direct impact in the lives and liberties of our children,

[02:11:48.060 --> 02:11:51.240]
our grandchildren, and even our great-grandchildren.

[02:11:51.680 --> 02:11:57.160]
We have only one chance to get it right and a solemn obligation to do so.

[02:11:57.160 --> 02:11:57.960]
You go, Ted.

[02:11:58.500 --> 02:11:59.200]
Have another drink.

[02:11:59.920 --> 02:12:00.600]
He's the man.

[02:12:01.300 --> 02:12:04.320]
On a 1247, a QAIM, here's a fact that says from Pedro.

[02:12:04.520 --> 02:12:04.900]
Hey, Pedro.

[02:12:05.620 --> 02:12:09.600]
Go to CursionLiars.com to see a clip of Wolf Blitzkrieg and Howard Dean.

[02:12:09.740 --> 02:12:10.640]
It's funny to see Wolf.

[02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:12.920]
He's face George says, just watch it and most of me.

[02:12:12.940 --> 02:12:13.080]
Yeah.

[02:12:13.420 --> 02:12:18.380]
I'm going to save it and I'm going to make a DVD out of it along with all the other little clips that we've gotten over here.

[02:12:18.400 --> 02:12:19.300]
Well, maybe we ought to put a clip.

[02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:22.220]
I'll link to it on our website if it's like an isolated clip.

[02:12:22.440 --> 02:12:24.880]
I will funnel the video to Eric right now.

[02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:25.880]
Funnel it to Eric right now.

[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:26.980]
Funnel it out over, man.

[02:12:27.940 --> 02:12:28.880]
Put it in a...

[02:12:29.700 --> 02:12:30.100]
QAIM.

[02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:31.480]
Why should I say it?

[02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:32.260]
It's sticking in the shoot.

[02:12:32.760 --> 02:12:32.960]
Right.

[02:12:33.180 --> 02:12:34.200]
Put it in like a demand.

[02:12:34.560 --> 02:12:35.440]
I'll shoot it over too.

[02:12:35.580 --> 02:12:38.480]
You'll put your deposit in the shoot it out over.

[02:12:38.760 --> 02:12:38.880]
You know?

[02:12:39.100 --> 02:12:40.380]
That seems to be what life's all about.

[02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:43.840]
Anyway, I've Ted Kennedy just roasted him an ass.

[02:12:44.180 --> 02:12:46.860]
Did you notice the family, the whole family sitting behind Elito,

[02:12:46.940 --> 02:12:50.640]
and they're all squirming like they just farted real bad or whatever.

[02:12:51.100 --> 02:12:52.000]
Maybe they got itchy ruins.

[02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:53.460]
That could be it.

[02:12:54.980 --> 02:12:59.740]
And like you said, they'll grill him and chill him and rake him over the colds and they'll say,

[02:12:59.960 --> 02:13:01.400]
okay, we'll confirm him.

[02:13:03.320 --> 02:13:04.120]
352 votes.

[02:13:04.120 --> 02:13:05.420]
What's your number one answer to this?

[02:13:05.540 --> 02:13:10.160]
Most people are stupid 101, A-hole 73, decent 59.

[02:13:10.560 --> 02:13:12.160]
Most people are...

[02:13:12.160 --> 02:13:12.280]
Yeah.

[02:13:12.840 --> 02:13:19.280]
A hypocrite's 56, 1-dimensional 21, reasonable 20, lifeless 5, bigots 5.

[02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:20.980]
By the way, 128 over 83.

[02:13:22.380 --> 02:13:22.880]
Very good.

[02:13:22.920 --> 02:13:23.620]
Bigots, huh?

[02:13:24.100 --> 02:13:24.400]
Good enough.

[02:13:25.860 --> 02:13:27.180]
What's wrong with that in the middle of the show?

[02:13:27.640 --> 02:13:28.360]
Nothing at all.

[02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:30.560]
Why you are just...

[02:13:30.560 --> 02:13:31.460]
I hate 50.

[02:13:33.920 --> 02:13:34.280]
I hate 50.

[02:13:34.460 --> 02:13:35.740]
How about 80 over 30?

[02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:36.320]
How would that be?

[02:13:36.440 --> 02:13:37.520]
80 over 30.

[02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:38.160]
I hate 50.

[02:13:38.580 --> 02:13:43.380]
Lifeless 5, bigots 5, ugly 4, perverts 3, jerks 3, and ruges 1, I don't have any at all.

[02:13:43.620 --> 02:13:43.980]
359.

[02:13:44.460 --> 02:13:47.520]
You see, now Georgia's pulling for me to croak because he figured he'd be got Joe Bell in there

[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:49.040]
instead of Greg, who hit him like poison.

[02:13:49.580 --> 02:13:52.720]
And Georgia's just going to add just slide right in there and take over that show.

[02:13:52.940 --> 02:13:53.620]
And what you're thinking?

[02:13:53.960 --> 02:13:54.540]
Sure, yeah.

[02:13:54.860 --> 02:13:55.420]
That's right.

[02:13:55.680 --> 02:13:56.220]
Are you kidding me?

[02:13:56.480 --> 02:13:58.300]
When the other guy was there, you had no chance.

[02:13:58.300 --> 02:14:00.580]
You didn't have a Chinaman's chance in Perkett or the other guy.

[02:14:00.820 --> 02:14:02.860]
You had Joe Bell in there and you got him snowed pretty well.

[02:14:04.180 --> 02:14:04.360]
Yeah.

[02:14:04.960 --> 02:14:05.320]
What?

[02:14:05.720 --> 02:14:07.160]
I had one conversation with him.

[02:14:07.260 --> 02:14:09.320]
Well, he evidently liked you enough to come and talk to you.

[02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:09.960]
How many of those...

[02:14:09.960 --> 02:14:12.860]
How many radio conversations did you have with Greg in 80 years?

[02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:15.160]
How about the big...

[02:14:15.160 --> 02:14:15.320]
Oh!

[02:14:15.540 --> 02:14:15.660]
None.

[02:14:16.200 --> 02:14:16.520]
Huh?

[02:14:16.760 --> 02:14:17.300]
That's a good guess.

[02:14:17.940 --> 02:14:20.800]
Other than the fact he hated you like poison and they wanted you to leave.

[02:14:21.540 --> 02:14:22.420]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:14:25.520 --> 02:14:26.280]
Q-A-M?

[02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:28.180]
No go.

[02:14:28.520 --> 02:14:29.360]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:14:30.140 --> 02:14:30.780]
Yes, hello.

[02:14:31.020 --> 02:14:31.300]
V-O?

[02:14:31.580 --> 02:14:32.020]
Yes, sir.

[02:14:33.260 --> 02:14:37.260]
I rented a movie over the weekend, the Magnolia.

[02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:37.920]
Yeah.

[02:14:38.140 --> 02:14:39.360]
And I absolutely loved it.

[02:14:39.460 --> 02:14:40.400]
I saw it three times.

[02:14:40.540 --> 02:14:41.360]
I think it's a good movie.

[02:14:41.440 --> 02:14:42.300]
Thanks for the recommendation.

[02:14:42.720 --> 02:14:43.220]
Three times.

[02:14:43.240 --> 02:14:45.180]
You must have had a lot of time on your hands this weekend.

[02:14:45.560 --> 02:14:45.640]
Yeah.

[02:14:46.520 --> 02:14:47.500]
Okay, thanks, Palli.

[02:14:48.100 --> 02:14:49.980]
Wow, it must be his whole house must be full of fraud.

[02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:50.460]
Oh, you think?

[02:14:50.740 --> 02:14:54.720]
And the good news is we got the definitive guide that's going to drop a copy off at a...

[02:14:54.720 --> 02:14:54.920]
Magnolia?

[02:14:55.140 --> 02:14:56.200]
Of Magnolia for John.

[02:14:56.220 --> 02:14:57.440]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[02:14:57.540 --> 02:14:59.000]
Right, Magnolia, my ass.

[02:14:59.380 --> 02:15:00.180]
I'll go get the book.

[02:15:00.360 --> 02:15:01.700]
I believe it when I see it.

[02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:05.140]
When Josh is watched the whole thing and don't be sleeping in the middle of it, okay?

[02:15:05.460 --> 02:15:07.980]
Well, I hope it shouldn't make me go to sleep, right?

[02:15:09.900 --> 02:15:10.900]
Just thanks, Jack.

[02:15:11.100 --> 02:15:11.100]

[02:15:11.620 --> 02:15:12.780]
Before you, uh...

[02:15:12.780 --> 02:15:14.020]
I told you I got this for you.

[02:15:14.020 --> 02:15:16.000]
Look, I didn't watch Dead Spots in this movie.

[02:15:16.160 --> 02:15:16.880]
I don't think so.

[02:15:16.960 --> 02:15:17.100]
Whatever.

[02:15:17.300 --> 02:15:17.860]
I'm going to watch it.

[02:15:17.900 --> 02:15:18.420]
Don't worry, okay?

[02:15:18.540 --> 02:15:19.520]
But you're watching City of God.

[02:15:21.020 --> 02:15:22.240]
If you watch this, yes.

[02:15:22.620 --> 02:15:22.860]
Okay.

[02:15:23.420 --> 02:15:24.200]
I was going to tell you that again.

[02:15:24.260 --> 02:15:26.880]
Which you already told me that they give a JZ or a D.

[02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:30.940]
A little Z or a PZ or a little Z or a old big Z or just watched it for the third time.

[02:15:30.960 --> 02:15:32.300]
Now they get really polling in it too.

[02:15:33.100 --> 02:15:33.600]
Oh, twice.

[02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:38.780]
A college professor and his wife have been charged with being long time illegal agents of human

[02:15:38.780 --> 02:15:39.940]
president Fidel Castro.

[02:15:40.280 --> 02:15:40.700]
Oh my God.

[02:15:41.200 --> 02:15:42.600]
The Associated Press is learning.

[02:15:42.640 --> 02:15:43.420]
Thank you, Blitz.

[02:15:44.340 --> 02:15:45.200]
Documents for today.

[02:15:45.300 --> 02:15:46.520]
You must have just record show.

[02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:48.940]
Isn't everybody communist?

[02:15:49.240 --> 02:15:49.700]
I thought so.

[02:15:49.780 --> 02:15:52.380]
Anybody who's not like a right-wing card-carrying Nazi?

[02:15:52.700 --> 02:15:53.040]
Little Z.

[02:15:53.660 --> 02:15:55.720]
Documents today show that Carlos Alvarez,

[02:15:55.720 --> 02:15:57.760]
a psychology professor at Florida International,

[02:15:57.960 --> 02:15:59.860]
FI and you and his wife Elsa Alvarez,

[02:16:00.300 --> 02:16:04.800]
have been charged with acting as agents of Cuba without registering with the US government is required.

[02:16:05.220 --> 02:16:08.020]
Now I understand why Miguel is under so much stress.

[02:16:09.680 --> 02:16:15.080]
The two are scheduled to make an initial appearance today before US magistrate judge Andrea Simon to the court of the documents.

[02:16:15.540 --> 02:16:19.740]
An indictment further describing the charges was expected to be unsealed after the court appearance.

[02:16:20.680 --> 02:16:25.200]
Alvarez identified as the on the FIU website as an associate professor in educational leadership

[02:16:25.200 --> 02:16:27.360]
and policy studies department.

[02:16:27.720 --> 02:16:33.380]
Elsa Alvarez described as coordinator in the social work training program specializing in psychological treatment,

[02:16:33.580 --> 02:16:36.900]
probably brainwashing the court of them, Christ is intervention in group psychotherapy.

[02:16:37.880 --> 02:16:41.080]
Alvarez did not return two full messages left in his office, not in his wife.

[02:16:41.400 --> 02:16:44.760]
A university spokesman also didn't return civil custody to come as an adult.

[02:16:45.860 --> 02:16:50.300]
US attorney R. Alexander R. Costa, the FBI and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service,

[02:16:50.760 --> 02:16:53.140]
scheduled a news conference later today to discuss the case.

[02:16:53.140 --> 02:16:57.960]
The indictment marks the latest certainly cloaked and dagger underworld of espionage between the US and Cuba.

[02:16:58.360 --> 02:17:02.580]
Much of it taking place in South Florida where thousands of Cuban ex-vows and other misfits live.

[02:17:02.700 --> 02:17:07.300]
Honey like that, green teeth, domino playing, alien loving,

[02:17:08.040 --> 02:17:11.180]

[02:18:10.040 --> 02:18:16.940]
Oh, we're gonna should even confirm here's their poll yes, 49% no 30% on sure 21%.

[02:18:16.940 --> 02:18:19.080]
That's their initial pool here on CNN.

[02:18:19.640 --> 02:18:20.020]
Let's see, let's see.

[02:18:20.040 --> 02:18:22.800]
Let's see, let's see, let's see, let's use our mainstream 52%.

[02:18:22.920 --> 02:18:25.740]
It's two extreme 30% don't know 18%.

[02:18:27.120 --> 02:18:31.500]
How do they, why are they taking this now before the hearings just starting now?

[02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:32.120]
Minutes ago.

[02:18:32.320 --> 02:18:32.880]
Shut up, puppy.

[02:18:33.340 --> 02:18:33.820]
I see.

[02:18:34.180 --> 02:18:37.260]
Maybe that's why they're taking them before the public finally gets on to them.

[02:18:38.060 --> 02:18:39.020]
W.A.M. Hello.

[02:18:40.160 --> 02:18:40.640]

W.A.M. Hello.

[02:18:45.340 --> 02:18:46.260]

[02:18:51.440 --> 02:18:53.220]
I know wonderful.

[02:18:53.560 --> 02:18:55.800]
I see they say I know something I knew it.

[02:18:55.960 --> 02:18:56.680]
House phone itself.

[02:18:56.940 --> 02:18:58.840]
He's got to get up to the two runs working today.

[02:18:59.020 --> 02:19:00.200]
You're your buddy really is.

[02:19:00.780 --> 02:19:01.620]

[02:19:02.060 --> 02:19:04.060]
Yeah, what did you play the mother right?

[02:19:04.460 --> 02:19:04.800]
Bankrum.

[02:19:05.580 --> 02:19:06.020]
Yeah.

[02:19:06.900 --> 02:19:08.540]
I think that was a great move.

[02:19:08.660 --> 02:19:09.540]
I said that a great plot.

[02:19:09.960 --> 02:19:10.400]
Malice?

[02:19:10.800 --> 02:19:11.020]
Yeah.

[02:19:11.540 --> 02:19:12.580]
You thought the ending was good?

[02:19:13.060 --> 02:19:15.240]
No, the ending move, but the ending was horrible.

[02:19:15.380 --> 02:19:18.660]
Yeah, the movie was kept me riveted for all the way through and then the ending sucked.

[02:19:19.280 --> 02:19:22.400]
Now, who was the guy to play the sucker?

[02:19:22.600 --> 02:19:23.320]
Jeff Daniels?

[02:19:23.920 --> 02:19:24.360]
Right.

[02:19:25.160 --> 02:19:31.240]
Now, when Baldwin went into the God thing, you know, who is the stepbran?

[02:19:31.420 --> 02:19:32.920]
Right, right.

[02:19:33.940 --> 02:19:36.700]

[02:19:36.860 --> 02:19:37.180]
Absolutely.

[02:19:37.540 --> 02:19:38.200]
All right, thanks, Neil.

[02:19:38.500 --> 02:19:38.740]
Okay.

[02:19:40.180 --> 02:19:41.160]
That was a good scene.

[02:19:41.860 --> 02:19:46.640]
The re-indignant and verio, you know, and you know, he was the doctor and doctors are God.

[02:19:46.800 --> 02:19:48.820]
He said he was God, but a beep, but a boop, but a beep.

[02:19:48.820 --> 02:19:51.380]
And he made them sure that they got the, you know, that he lost the case.

[02:19:51.740 --> 02:19:54.440]
And she got the $20 million settlement from the insurance company.

[02:19:54.700 --> 02:19:56.240]
And then it turns out they were in cohoots.

[02:19:56.420 --> 02:19:57.400]
Oh, I don't want to spoil it for you.

[02:19:58.060 --> 02:19:58.360]
Oh, yeah.

[02:19:58.620 --> 02:19:58.760]
Oh, yeah.

[02:19:58.760 --> 02:19:59.700]
I'll forgive the movie.

[02:19:59.860 --> 02:20:00.040]
It's 93.

[02:20:00.040 --> 02:20:00.920]
It's called Malice.

[02:20:00.940 --> 02:20:01.740]
You enjoyed it.

[02:20:01.740 --> 02:20:02.460]
And it's got a full watch.

[02:20:02.460 --> 02:20:02.980]
I'll give it a watch.

[02:20:03.440 --> 02:20:05.200]
It's got a cool Kim and Zahanson there.

[02:20:05.400 --> 02:20:06.220]
I love her eyes.

[02:20:06.460 --> 02:20:07.200]
Well, here you go.

[02:20:07.380 --> 02:20:08.000]
And the front side too.

[02:20:08.120 --> 02:20:10.020]
And, well, it's got a few other parts in there too.

[02:20:10.100 --> 02:20:13.400]
I don't recall like a whole lot, but it's got just on a few of the right parts.

[02:20:13.520 --> 02:20:14.240]
Haven't seen a part of that.

[02:20:14.320 --> 02:20:14.740]
I don't like it.

[02:20:15.020 --> 02:20:15.020]

[02:20:16.220 --> 02:20:17.160]

Oh, my God, Neil.

Well, at least you got an author I love in 30.

So I'm with you about about two minutes.

[02:20:41.540 --> 02:20:42.300]
That's that's too much.

[02:20:42.440 --> 02:20:43.440]
Cut it down about half.

[02:20:48.720 --> 02:20:50.760]
I don't understand how come you don't go big time.

[02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:51.840]
Don't ask your men.

[02:20:52.280 --> 02:20:53.620]

I'll be damned. Uh oh, more bad news from Rackers and Update and this seems

[02:36:23.480 --> 02:36:26.320]
to be- Why don't you ever read any of the good news from a rank? Here's uh

[02:36:26.320 --> 02:36:29.360]
seems to be the deal lately you start out with one number early in the name

[02:36:29.360 --> 02:36:32.220]
this keeps their growing they just have to keep putting the body parts together.

[02:36:32.440 --> 02:36:36.560]
One, two, three. Exactly. Two suicide car bombs exploded outside of

[02:36:36.560 --> 02:36:39.960]
our back heavily guarded interior ministry in Baghdad today killing at least 20

[02:36:39.960 --> 02:36:45.040]
wounding more than 25 many of them policemen. Last time is more than 14

[02:36:45.040 --> 02:36:47.940]
civilian vehicles. The interior ministry is located next to the police

[02:36:47.940 --> 02:36:52.040]
academy where a ceremony parade celebrated the 84th anniversary of the

[02:36:52.040 --> 02:36:55.120]
formation of the formation of the Iraqi police force was taking place at the

[02:36:55.120 --> 02:37:00.620]
time of the blast. And they like that. I don't- I think maybe they'll like

[02:37:00.620 --> 02:37:03.660]
take a little hiatus from parades and public demonstrations.

[02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:07.140]
Yeah, but although I love a parade but nevertheless how can freedom be on the

[02:37:07.140 --> 02:37:09.700]
mark if we can't mark? As a matter of fact when you come right down to it

[02:37:09.700 --> 02:37:12.760]
why do people watch parades in the front? You know I- I hope we had yesterday

[02:37:12.760 --> 02:37:16.020]
it over the weekend. Maybe it's the important events. Huh? Maybe it's for the kids

[02:37:16.020 --> 02:37:18.740]
I don't know. Oh we want to see the floats. We like to see the floats.

[02:37:19.160 --> 02:37:22.700]
Yay. Now what parade was it was it on Thanksgiving where somebody damn

[02:37:22.700 --> 02:37:24.640]
you got killed in Detroit with the Macy's parade?

[02:37:25.380 --> 02:37:29.200]
What are those? Remember knocked one of the street lights uh whatever

[02:37:29.200 --> 02:37:32.440]
on their head whatever the hell it was. Well I don't know it's one of those

[02:37:32.440 --> 02:37:35.320]
things that the people are into don't ask me why it's like religion right. They're

[02:37:35.320 --> 02:37:39.740]
into it heavy duty but I haven't got a clue why. Maybe they're a fear of death.

[02:37:40.800 --> 02:37:45.160]
That just could be it. Or maybe they're just stupid. Here's the poll.

[02:37:45.160 --> 02:37:49.580]
What's your number one answer to this? Most people are stupid. 138. There you go. That's why

[02:37:49.580 --> 02:37:57.680]
the religions have a field day. 464 votes. Stupid 138. A hole is 83. Dishon 77. Most people are just

[02:37:57.680 --> 02:38:03.840]
good playing hard work in decent folk aren't they? Yeah okay. No. Hipper Crit 74. One dimensional.

[02:38:04.180 --> 02:38:15.140]
One dimensional's got. But third man. Reasonable 24. Bigots 9. Rude 6. That's starting to

[02:38:15.140 --> 02:38:22.540]
pay. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger received 15 stitches on his lip yesterday. After he and his 12

[02:38:22.540 --> 02:38:25.980]
year old son were involved in the motorcycle accident near the LA homage spokesman said.

[02:38:27.100 --> 02:38:30.660]
Schwarzenegger was riding a Harley Davidson motorcycle with his son Patrick in the sidecar

[02:38:30.660 --> 02:38:35.260]
with another driver back into the street. The governor was unable to avoid the vehicle in his

[02:38:35.260 --> 02:38:39.940]
path to lead at low speed. Both Schwarzenegger and his son were treated for cuts and bruises.

[02:38:40.920 --> 02:38:44.960]
I'm joking about it. St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica released. Both were wearing helmets

[02:38:44.960 --> 02:38:51.280]
at the time. The other driver unindured. Aren't you excited about that? I eat great. I'm a great

[02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:55.340]
one. I wonder what Pat Robertson has to say about that. That was a warning from God is what it was.

[02:38:55.520 --> 02:38:59.080]
What got saved him from it being anyway. That was a warning from the Lord. You better cut your crap

[02:38:59.080 --> 02:39:03.580]
Arnold. Okay. Or you're going to be next. You and Hugo Chavez.

[02:39:05.740 --> 02:39:11.160]
I was thinking of 85 million reasons not to go on cruise ships. The other good thing is if you

[02:39:11.160 --> 02:39:15.500]
like have some kind of a misstep on a cruise ship. I don't read a cause. Be an EMS NBC staff will be

[02:39:15.500 --> 02:39:23.800]
there for weeks on in afterward. Try to piece together the history. Oh, she is just brutal. It's

[02:39:23.800 --> 02:39:30.040]
unspeakable. She's unspeakable. But I'm going to tell you something as bad as she is compared to

[02:39:30.040 --> 02:39:34.220]
the Mori and Connie show which debuted yesterday. She's like an award winner. You're peeking like

[02:39:34.220 --> 02:39:39.140]
curiosity about that. I just couldn't believe it. I watched about two minutes. Oh, like what

[02:39:39.140 --> 02:39:42.740]
I had to ask me if I saw the thing with Mattie McConaughey and Terry Bradshaw on there.

[02:39:43.220 --> 02:39:48.700]
And then he told me he liked it. And I didn't I watched about a minute of it to see what the

[02:39:48.700 --> 02:39:55.820]
hell it was. And it was pathetic. Did you see a charge? No, they got. Oh, first of all,

[02:39:55.900 --> 02:40:00.280]
anything Terry Bradshaw is involved in is got to be so stupid and so illiterate and so ignorant.

[02:40:00.480 --> 02:40:06.100]
It's just it's indescribable. And then this is what they're appealing to you. See, I just don't

[02:40:06.100 --> 02:40:09.860]
understand. In other words, if I'm a football fan, which I am, I have to be that dumb. Is that

[02:40:09.860 --> 02:40:14.860]
the deal? Is that the message that the neighbors are telling me that I have to be a moron and watch

[02:40:14.860 --> 02:40:19.920]
these x-josh slap at each other on the back and high five and then yuck it up and fake arguments

[02:40:19.920 --> 02:40:24.380]
back and forth. And there's Jimmy and his Johnson who just rake it in the cash. Lack on up his ass,

[02:40:24.580 --> 02:40:31.600]
you know, what a foamy he is. Jimmy's Johnson. He sure talks to the game. No,

[02:40:31.600 --> 02:40:36.240]
bap bap bap bap bap bap bap bap bap bap bap bap bap bap bap, you know, you're full of crap Jimmy, okay?

[02:40:37.120 --> 02:40:41.280]
Anyway, the cruise ships get back to that. Officials were searching Saturday for a 15-year-old girl

[02:40:41.280 --> 02:40:49.160]
from Ireland, who they said fell off a ship near Isla, Mojeres, the olive women. Is that what that

[02:40:49.160 --> 02:40:53.680]
is? My favorite island, right? A Caribbean island near Cancun is popular with tourists does.

[02:40:54.420 --> 02:41:00.880]
Isla, Mojeres, or like Santa. Oh, man. Very, very, very. Where do the Spaniards get that from?

[02:41:00.880 --> 02:41:05.280]
I think they had a movie. I think the king had a, like a frog. They had what it was. I can just throw it.

[02:41:05.280 --> 02:41:09.680]
Maybe Isabella. Maybe she had some, she thought, you know, it was something interesting, but it's not.

[02:41:11.080 --> 02:41:15.300]
The Costa Magica cruise ship was 26 miles away from the island the pre-dawn hours Thursday.

[02:41:15.680 --> 02:41:19.780]
When the teenager fell off the Caribbean according to the ship's captain, Giuseppe Russo.

[02:41:21.140 --> 02:41:26.500]
Giuseppe Russo. So schmalsy, man. Russo identified the victim as Lindsay O'Brien. Did not.

[02:41:26.760 --> 02:41:30.320]
What are with these names, you know? Like I'm watching a football games over the weekend.

[02:41:30.320 --> 02:41:37.940]
What are these names? I just don't get it. I guess there are too many people named Mary and Bob and Tom

[02:41:37.940 --> 02:41:41.980]
and John and the boring names. So we got to come up with something fancy like that Vokabrins.

[02:41:42.100 --> 02:41:46.620]
We need something fancy. Lindsay O'Brien and didn't divulge her hometown.

[02:41:47.640 --> 02:41:52.000]
Newspapers and they missing teens native Ireland's fellow reverse name, LYNSEY, however,

[02:41:52.400 --> 02:41:57.040]
and reported she was from Dublin. He spelled it LYN. Lindsay like Lindsay, but it's from Dublin.

[02:41:57.040 --> 02:42:01.960]
Maybe she was Dublin or Pleasure. Rob Seek conditions that slowed the surge sedge in

[02:42:01.960 --> 02:42:06.060]
Errol Medina, a federal official at the office of the poor captain on East Lamel's Hattest.

[02:42:06.420 --> 02:42:10.440]
While their rescue efforts continued via Mexican coast guard helicopters, officials were no

[02:42:10.440 --> 02:42:16.000]
longer optimistic about finding her alive. Guess where the ship led from on January the first?

[02:42:16.660 --> 02:42:22.220]
Out of the port? A lot per day? No, it's the one for Lauderdale. On January I want

[02:42:22.220 --> 02:42:26.620]
trying to spend a week visiting sites in the so-called River Amaya near Cancun before heading to Cuba.

[02:42:27.040 --> 02:42:30.360]
It had been scheduled to arrive at the island of Crosumelles south of East Lamel Hattest early

[02:42:30.360 --> 02:42:34.360]
Thursday morning, but was delayed because of the surge. The Italian fact, a flag coast

[02:42:34.360 --> 02:42:38.180]
of magic is part of the fleet of Crosum's cruises, which is controlled by my enemy-based Carnival

[02:42:38.180 --> 02:42:43.100]
Corp, the world's largest cruise operator, slept him in a Mickey baby, how do you like that?

[02:42:43.700 --> 02:42:47.720]
Another one bites at us. And they still haven't found that guy that, well,

[02:42:47.820 --> 02:42:49.900]
all the blood in the room and the big, they're fighting the brawl and everything,

[02:42:50.040 --> 02:42:54.060]
you know, that guy that disappeared? Right. Still haven't found his ass or the rest of me,

[02:42:54.060 --> 02:42:58.980]
either. Oh no, you're wrong, Neil. There's no vacation like going on a cruise, man. There's

[02:42:58.980 --> 02:43:04.100]
nothing like cruising it. Yeah, I've been cruising. Remember those years long ago when some people

[02:43:04.100 --> 02:43:07.280]
used to be cruising this game Boulevard till 3, 4, 5 in the morning. Remember those years?

[02:43:08.040 --> 02:43:14.400]
Not George though. Hey, there was something out there for everybody. And of course now there's

[02:43:14.400 --> 02:43:18.300]
like a different disease out there for everybody. I'm thinking. They're still like hookers on

[02:43:18.300 --> 02:43:23.200]
this game Boulevard and not. You know how out of touch I am. Do you think? I don't know.

[02:43:23.200 --> 02:43:27.940]
Well, how do I would you know? You never on this game Boulevard? That's way, I would say you're

[02:43:27.940 --> 02:43:32.720]
probably about as far south right now. No, I take that back. Now you're going to, now you're going

[02:43:32.720 --> 02:43:37.800]
to have to get a passport when they move the station. That's true. That's because I'm moving

[02:43:37.800 --> 02:43:42.240]
the railroad. Well, what? Huh? I go over here to Best Buy all the time, but this is about as far

[02:43:42.240 --> 02:43:46.940]
south as I get as I go. No, but what is it? 150 something that's because I forget that's on

[02:43:46.940 --> 02:43:52.640]
the outside. It's like a hundred and eighty eighty-nine something there less. Oh, it's only a few

[02:43:52.640 --> 02:43:56.140]
blocks down the road down to Hershey Highland. Like just through with the 90 gardens. It's like one block.

[02:43:56.140 --> 02:43:59.460]
Well, I mean, don't you think I know I was there as a lot of times to pick up my packs and checks

[02:43:59.460 --> 02:44:03.620]
when I wasn't working when they were paying like a 404 or 180 plus or like that? Maybe Joe Goe is

[02:44:03.620 --> 02:44:07.140]
going to have the good news for me to go to pay me for next three years, but no work. Maybe once

[02:44:07.140 --> 02:44:11.780]
in a while at Camille, I guess the parents, like you're holding on the fort. Right. Hold it up

[02:44:11.780 --> 02:44:15.900]
for two or three or like. What do you think? Anything that's a good idea? No. Hey, if you're at a dead-end

[02:44:15.900 --> 02:44:19.560]
job and underpaid like poor Josh Cortes, I hope I can get some good news on your raises.

[02:44:19.760 --> 02:44:23.780]
Parents talk about your raise yet. It's already the ninth of January. What do you think? No.

[02:44:24.920 --> 02:44:28.500]
Well, don't let me forget now. You know, you're sitting there when clearance comes in every

[02:44:28.500 --> 02:44:33.300]
morning. If he happens to show up tomorrow, I'm sure he will. Put his feet to the fire. Okay.

[02:44:34.400 --> 02:44:38.780]
I'll help you. Like I have all along. I'll like put a gun to his head. They cut the crap clearance.

[02:44:38.920 --> 02:44:42.960]
You idiot. You're quizzling. You ferry. If you're underpaid and then in job, if you news

Today we salute you Mr. Egghead, jeopardy contestant.

[02:46:00.780 --> 02:46:03.600]

With a head full of knowledge and a fistful of butter.

[02:46:30.780 --> 02:46:33.900]

So the next time you think you're smart enough to be on that show,

[02:46:42.280 --> 02:46:46.460]
clap your brains on the couch and drop your jaw.

[02:46:46.720 --> 02:46:50.740]
It's a loot to Mr. Egghead, jeopardy contestant.

[02:46:50.740 --> 02:46:53.220]
A real American hero.

[02:46:56.840 --> 02:46:58.700]
Sorry, form of a question please.

[02:46:58.940 --> 02:47:02.460]
27-2. What's a really bad show on at 7-30 every night?

[02:47:03.560 --> 02:47:05.980]
What's your authorized spying skills into Lolito hearings?

[02:47:06.440 --> 02:47:07.280]
I know it's over my head.

[02:47:09.260 --> 02:47:10.520]
You were said, huh?

[02:47:10.860 --> 02:47:12.200]
There actually is a jeopardy,

[02:47:12.280 --> 02:47:14.660]
a star machine game, by the way.

[02:47:15.100 --> 02:47:15.540]
Is there?

[02:47:15.940 --> 02:47:16.980]
Yeah, I haven't played it.

[02:47:17.260 --> 02:47:21.200]
In fact, they're like almost, you name a TV show like sitcoms and all this other crap.

[02:47:21.340 --> 02:47:23.960]
And there's like, really, slot games.

[02:47:24.180 --> 02:47:25.000]
Yeah, three companies.

[02:47:26.020 --> 02:47:27.940]
There's what family feud?

[02:47:28.860 --> 02:47:29.300]
Okay.

[02:47:29.760 --> 02:47:32.020]
Maybe I'll start trying them different games.

[02:47:32.220 --> 02:47:32.580]
What do you think?

[02:47:33.080 --> 02:47:34.820]
Might improve your luck?

[02:47:35.200 --> 02:47:36.200]
Yeah, or now?

[02:47:36.200 --> 02:47:36.920]
Or crush it, right?

[02:47:37.680 --> 02:47:40.460]
US senators challenging Samuel Lolito Supreme Court nomination

[02:47:40.460 --> 02:47:43.520]
are focusing on a potentially combustible issue

[02:47:44.200 --> 02:47:45.900]
to raise the confirmationary starting today,

[02:47:46.040 --> 02:47:47.280]
the limits of presidential power.

[02:47:47.940 --> 02:47:51.180]
For the next several days, the members of this committee will question you

[02:47:51.180 --> 02:47:54.000]
to find out what kind of justice you will be.

[02:47:54.720 --> 02:47:56.420]
Senator St. Alito, is that pretty profound?

[02:47:56.860 --> 02:47:57.060]
Oh, yeah.

[02:47:57.080 --> 02:47:59.060]
These are the opening statements again, total wasted time.

[02:47:59.500 --> 02:48:02.860]
Senator St. Alito's writings and dozing their strong executive have taken new significance

[02:48:02.860 --> 02:48:06.300]
since the disclosure that dictator George W. Bush authorized

[02:48:06.300 --> 02:48:08.100]
eavesdropping on Americans without court approval.

[02:48:09.400 --> 02:48:10.680]
See, here's another rarer.

[02:48:10.760 --> 02:48:14.080]
How many reasons have we got for Bush to be impeached now?

[02:48:14.160 --> 02:48:15.080]
About third, man.

[02:48:15.600 --> 02:48:16.500]
I would say at least.

[02:48:16.760 --> 02:48:16.880]
Right.

[02:48:17.140 --> 02:48:18.920]
And in the meantime, but a bit, but a boop, but about

[02:48:18.920 --> 02:48:21.500]
when he's in a rose garden this morning and talking crap.

[02:48:23.060 --> 02:48:25.520]
Democrats have decided the issue is so politically potent

[02:48:25.520 --> 02:48:28.040]
that they're leaving questions on abortion mainly to Republicans,

[02:48:28.460 --> 02:48:31.060]
a tactic that runs the risk of offending some of their strongest supporters.

[02:48:31.680 --> 02:48:35.440]
The intense focus on presidential powers under some women's rights groups,

[02:48:35.640 --> 02:48:38.880]
which have traditionally played a central role in Supreme Court confirmation hearings.

[02:48:39.240 --> 02:48:41.120]
Another stupid move by the Democrats is usual.

[02:48:41.720 --> 02:48:44.580]
Grasping defeat from the draws of victory, which is their speciality.

[02:48:44.860 --> 02:48:45.440]
New juror.

[02:48:46.200 --> 02:48:48.480]
Even to Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee,

[02:48:48.820 --> 02:48:53.260]
Chairman Arlen Magic Bullard Spector of Pennsylvania, and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina,

[02:48:53.700 --> 02:48:57.060]
say they'll query Alito, they'll query him on the responsibility of the courts to

[02:48:57.660 --> 02:48:58.860]
constrain presidential authority.

[02:48:59.360 --> 02:49:02.260]
The spying raises very fundamental questions about how we proceed together.

[02:49:02.440 --> 02:49:05.180]
Information fundamental questions on privacy and the Bill of Rights

[02:49:05.180 --> 02:49:05.720]
spectruses.

[02:49:06.020 --> 02:49:06.800]
Bill of Rights, what that?

[02:49:07.880 --> 02:49:08.480]
I remember those.

[02:49:08.660 --> 02:49:10.680]
Don't you just a piece, but when you're just a little child.

[02:49:12.740 --> 02:49:13.780]
In fact, that would be a good thing.

[02:49:13.860 --> 02:49:16.100]
I'm doing a poll about things you miss from your childhood.

[02:49:16.380 --> 02:49:16.860]
The Bill of Rights.

[02:49:16.940 --> 02:49:17.260]
There you go.

[02:49:17.360 --> 02:49:18.300]
Free speech.

[02:49:19.420 --> 02:49:20.140]
I like that.

[02:49:21.580 --> 02:49:24.080]
567, are you going to take a couple more calls for this half hour?

[02:49:24.160 --> 02:49:25.740]
That would be really a bad mistake on your part.

[02:49:25.740 --> 02:49:26.580]
Come on.

[02:49:26.580 --> 02:49:28.060]
It'd be nice if we had some.

[02:49:28.400 --> 02:49:30.900]
Well, I've been rambling there, man.

[02:49:31.020 --> 02:49:31.660]
I've been rambling there.

[02:49:31.720 --> 02:49:32.160]
And I will see.

[02:49:32.440 --> 02:49:34.760]
Speaking of that during the next break, the video is up on the website.

[02:49:35.880 --> 02:49:37.260]
The video is up on the website.

[02:49:37.520 --> 02:49:39.600]
How are Dean and Elkley's screen and Howard Dean?

[02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:43.080]
Bear in mind, he asks him one very boring question first about terrorism,

[02:49:43.220 --> 02:49:46.180]
and then they go into the whole Abrahamathan, which is funny to hear.

[02:49:46.820 --> 02:49:48.640]
Wolf's reaction when he doesn't get the answer he wants.

[02:49:48.880 --> 02:49:49.320]
I see.

[02:49:49.540 --> 02:49:50.540]
Like speechless, huh?

[02:49:51.140 --> 02:49:53.580]
Oh, the the side, the heavy breath side.

[02:49:56.540 --> 02:49:57.480]
Too bad, Wolf.

[02:49:57.660 --> 02:49:58.700]
OK, take off the hip boots.

[02:49:58.820 --> 02:49:59.060]
You're out.

[02:50:01.100 --> 02:50:01.820]
567, 0560.

[02:50:01.940 --> 02:50:04.220]
Let's get a thousand calls in between now and two o'clock.

[02:50:04.320 --> 02:50:06.180]
What do you say before the molemeister comes on?

[02:50:07.520 --> 02:50:08.400]
Let's get with it.

[02:50:09.700 --> 02:50:10.400]
Let me QAM.

[02:50:10.520 --> 02:50:10.700]
Hello.

[02:50:11.080 --> 02:50:11.600]
Hello, Neil.

[02:50:12.060 --> 02:50:12.380]
Yes, sir.

[02:50:12.460 --> 02:50:12.900]
How are you doing?

[02:50:13.040 --> 02:50:13.640]
I got one people.

[02:50:14.260 --> 02:50:14.480]
OK.

[02:50:14.760 --> 02:50:19.020]
How about those local TV news shows that have their view point or shows?

[02:50:19.020 --> 02:50:20.060]
They come on Sunday morning?

[02:50:21.820 --> 02:50:22.180]
Yeah.

[02:50:22.700 --> 02:50:23.600]
You get tired of those.

[02:50:23.600 --> 02:50:24.660]
They say one of those comes on.

[02:50:24.720 --> 02:50:26.640]
I want to get a rupee and raise my stuff.

[02:50:26.640 --> 02:50:27.240]
I do with our pool.

[02:50:27.420 --> 02:50:27.800]
I understand.

[02:50:28.020 --> 02:50:28.980]
What does that got to do with the pool?

[02:50:29.520 --> 02:50:32.520]
Isn't it a show that you tired of or something or whatever it is?

[02:50:32.600 --> 02:50:33.160]
Yeah, I know.

[02:50:33.220 --> 02:50:34.260]
It's calls that we're tired of.

[02:50:34.340 --> 02:50:37.820]
Like here's shows that you're tired of.

[02:50:37.980 --> 02:50:38.780]
Where do you get that?

[02:50:39.160 --> 02:50:39.700]
Who knows?

[02:50:39.940 --> 02:50:41.380]
Probably you've pulled it out of his back bone.

[02:50:41.540 --> 02:50:41.860]
Ask.

[02:50:43.020 --> 02:50:43.340]
God.

[02:50:44.080 --> 02:50:44.400]
122AM.

[02:50:44.540 --> 02:50:44.700]
Hello.

[02:50:45.340 --> 02:50:45.900]
Hey, Neil.

[02:50:46.260 --> 02:50:46.620]
Yes, sir.

[02:50:47.220 --> 02:50:49.300]
I'll tell you what about that movie, Bearback Mountain.

[02:50:49.720 --> 02:50:49.880]
Right.

[02:50:50.040 --> 02:50:50.400]
Tell me one.

[02:50:50.460 --> 02:50:51.000]
I'll make you a bet.

[02:50:51.380 --> 02:50:52.240]
I wouldn't steer you wrong.

[02:50:52.360 --> 02:50:53.580]
If you go to that movie, you don't

[02:50:53.580 --> 02:50:55.080]
get for clumped.

[02:50:55.080 --> 02:50:55.800]
More than one time.

[02:50:55.900 --> 02:50:56.540]
It's a love story.

[02:50:57.060 --> 02:50:57.260]
Right.

[02:50:57.280 --> 02:50:57.820]
You're in simple.

[02:50:57.940 --> 02:50:59.880]
If they don't like who's love and who, that's their business.

[02:51:00.080 --> 02:51:01.320]
But it's a love story.

[02:51:01.780 --> 02:51:03.340]
How about you dinner at Rupert Steakhouse

[02:51:03.340 --> 02:51:05.100]
if you don't get for clumped before the other movie?

[02:51:05.420 --> 02:51:05.660]
OK.

[02:51:06.140 --> 02:51:06.660]
It's all right.

[02:51:07.180 --> 02:51:07.520]
OK.

[02:51:07.620 --> 02:51:09.040]
We're making a little clump word to what's

[02:51:09.040 --> 02:51:09.120]
seen.

[02:51:09.220 --> 02:51:10.060]
He'll get clumped.

[02:51:10.120 --> 02:51:11.920]
If you say one more time, we're going to get you.

[02:51:13.880 --> 02:51:14.900]
He reached this quota.

[02:51:15.160 --> 02:51:16.680]
Well, he didn't want to say like choked up

[02:51:16.680 --> 02:51:18.180]
and the teardrop and stuff like that.

[02:51:18.360 --> 02:51:20.040]
I got choked up pretty into that one

[02:51:20.040 --> 02:51:21.380]
the other night that imaginary heroes.

[02:51:22.160 --> 02:51:22.520]
OK.

[02:51:22.520 --> 02:51:25.120]
And it wasn't just because Emil Hersh was in it.

[02:51:26.380 --> 02:51:28.120]
They're good acting in that, especially

[02:51:28.120 --> 02:51:29.260]
by a Sigourney Weaver.

[02:51:29.740 --> 02:51:31.240]
And nothing popped out of her stomach either.

[02:51:31.340 --> 02:51:32.300]
Well, I guess Emil did.

[02:51:32.760 --> 02:51:35.000]
Oh, all of a turn out that his daddy wasn't really his daddy.

[02:51:35.140 --> 02:51:35.860]
Oh, I shouldn't have said that.

[02:51:36.200 --> 02:51:37.080]
Oh, that's bad.

[02:51:37.360 --> 02:51:37.740]
You're bad.

[02:51:39.480 --> 02:51:40.600]
Well, it was good.

[02:51:40.780 --> 02:51:41.440]
Everything was excellent.

[02:51:41.640 --> 02:51:43.620]
And the only problem was the ending.

[02:51:43.680 --> 02:51:45.040]
I'm not going to spoil it for you.

[02:51:45.060 --> 02:51:48.280]
But the ending was like it was one of those abrupt turns.

[02:51:48.620 --> 02:51:49.300]
You know, I hate that.

[02:51:49.580 --> 02:51:51.220]
And all of a sudden everybody's happy.

[02:51:51.220 --> 02:51:53.340]
And everybody's smiling.

[02:51:53.700 --> 02:51:55.160]
And they're all dressed real neat and clean.

[02:51:55.180 --> 02:51:56.700]
And the kid graduates from high school.

[02:51:57.080 --> 02:51:59.120]
And he plays the piano up there on the stage.

[02:51:59.340 --> 02:52:01.800]
And they're just, oh, it just, but I guess

[02:52:01.800 --> 02:52:03.040]
after all the grief they put you through,

[02:52:03.100 --> 02:52:03.660]
they needed that.

[02:52:03.800 --> 02:52:06.320]
You know, I did shed a little tear there

[02:52:06.320 --> 02:52:07.660]
toward about 2, 3rds of the way through.

[02:52:07.760 --> 02:52:08.680]
It was kind of sad, you know.

[02:52:08.920 --> 02:52:09.700]
Oh, I have to watch it.

[02:52:09.800 --> 02:52:11.460]
Plus, I could relate to the part about having

[02:52:11.460 --> 02:52:13.280]
a real piece of crap father.

[02:52:13.280 --> 02:52:15.100]
Although it wasn't really his father, but he raised him.

[02:52:15.100 --> 02:52:17.340]
But it wasn't really his biological father.

[02:52:17.520 --> 02:52:17.800]
I know.

[02:52:18.560 --> 02:52:20.880]
Well, boy, would there be a refreshing if you found that out?

[02:52:21.380 --> 02:52:21.740]
What?

[02:52:22.020 --> 02:52:24.360]
That the guy you thought was your dad really wasn't?

[02:52:24.560 --> 02:52:25.440]
Well, what difference does it make?

[02:52:25.620 --> 02:52:26.640]
He still screwed up your life.

[02:52:26.740 --> 02:52:27.080]
That's true.

[02:52:28.340 --> 02:52:30.520]
So all that accident of biology, you know.

[02:52:30.900 --> 02:52:31.000]
Yeah.

[02:52:31.220 --> 02:52:34.520]
Why is it that most guys I know have had horrible fathers?

[02:52:35.240 --> 02:52:35.480]
I don't know.

[02:52:35.600 --> 02:52:38.120]
Not so much women, but men.

[02:52:39.560 --> 02:52:40.580]
I don't know.

[02:52:40.880 --> 02:52:41.320]
Do you know what I'm saying?

[02:52:42.580 --> 02:52:44.880]
Now Josh there, he's got, I don't know about his father.

[02:52:44.980 --> 02:52:45.120]
I don't know.

[02:52:45.200 --> 02:52:46.160]
Aren't your parents divorced?

[02:52:46.820 --> 02:52:47.200]
Yes, they are.

[02:52:47.540 --> 02:52:49.620]
And your father was a good guy.

[02:52:49.620 --> 02:52:50.740]
Oh, see, there you go.

[02:52:50.820 --> 02:52:52.280]
There's one at a stepfather's a good guy.

[02:52:52.360 --> 02:52:53.380]
See, he had two good dads.

[02:52:53.580 --> 02:52:54.660]
We could go on, but he didn't see no good.

[02:52:54.660 --> 02:52:55.700]
That makes up to us.

[02:52:55.940 --> 02:52:56.060]
Yeah.

[02:52:57.180 --> 02:52:57.860]
I'll be damned.

[02:52:59.220 --> 02:53:01.800]
5, 6, 7, your thoughts on your dead dad.

[02:53:01.920 --> 02:53:02.620]
Wouldn't have to be dead.

[02:53:02.680 --> 02:53:03.920]
But of course, if he's alive and you're a man,

[02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:05.260]
ask him, probably, cut you out of the will.

[02:53:06.240 --> 02:53:06.560]
Right.

[02:53:07.080 --> 02:53:07.400]
Right.

[02:53:07.820 --> 02:53:08.080]
In the life.

[02:53:08.520 --> 02:53:11.700]
See, I found out in that obituary that my father died

[02:53:11.700 --> 02:53:13.140]
in a, what do they call it?

[02:53:13.140 --> 02:53:13.500]
Not a nursing.

[02:53:13.640 --> 02:53:14.560]
Maybe it wasn't nursing home.

[02:53:14.820 --> 02:53:15.020]
Hostess.

[02:53:15.500 --> 02:53:16.140]
Was that it?

[02:53:16.640 --> 02:53:19.120]
That's usually where they take it.

[02:53:19.820 --> 02:53:20.820]
Well, what do you mean?

[02:53:20.940 --> 02:53:22.160]
Were they taking, run out the clock?

[02:53:22.380 --> 02:53:24.000]
When there's nothing more they can do for you at the hospital?

[02:53:24.380 --> 02:53:24.740]
I see.

[02:53:25.200 --> 02:53:25.640]
I don't know.

[02:53:25.640 --> 02:53:25.900]
I don't think so.

[02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:27.120]
I think it's like a retirement home.

[02:53:27.520 --> 02:53:27.520]

[02:53:28.260 --> 02:53:29.200]
Where this is the living set.

[02:53:29.240 --> 02:53:30.180]
Where old Jews go.

[02:53:30.260 --> 02:53:30.820]
Yeah, something like that.

[02:53:30.880 --> 02:53:32.600]
Where miserable, hateful old Jews like Hingo.

[02:53:33.560 --> 02:53:35.660]
Where they can trail about that wonderful son

[02:53:35.660 --> 02:53:37.900]
on the radio is such a starly thing.

[02:53:38.820 --> 02:53:40.620]
Anyway, he's rotting somewhere out here into that.

[02:53:41.380 --> 02:53:42.460]
Somebody QIM, hello?

[02:53:44.020 --> 02:53:44.380]
Hello?

[02:53:44.740 --> 02:53:45.160]
Yes, sir.

[02:53:45.640 --> 02:53:46.720]
Yeah, I want to speak to you.

[02:53:47.120 --> 02:53:47.480]
Speaking.

[02:53:47.900 --> 02:53:50.540]
But now got a movie I would highly recommend.

[02:53:51.020 --> 02:53:51.260]
OK.

[02:53:51.980 --> 02:53:52.340]
Hospital.

[02:53:53.280 --> 02:53:55.200]
And I'm sure George will rather the world

[02:53:55.200 --> 02:53:56.700]
have sex and nudity going on.

[02:53:56.880 --> 02:53:57.540]
All right, all right.

[02:53:57.960 --> 02:53:59.440]
No, as you need to check it out, man.

[02:53:59.640 --> 02:54:00.520]
It's not right now, right?

[02:54:00.980 --> 02:54:01.920]
Yeah, I came up right.

[02:54:02.140 --> 02:54:03.280]
It's very good movie man.

[02:54:03.320 --> 02:54:04.240]
OK, thanks a lot, Pali.

[02:54:04.320 --> 02:54:04.900]
We'll check it out.

[02:54:05.220 --> 02:54:05.540]
All right.

[02:54:06.440 --> 02:54:06.840]
You see it?

[02:54:07.240 --> 02:54:09.340]
It's not, see in Florida when I showed it

[02:54:09.340 --> 02:54:11.540]
the showies and florists felt HOST, ILE.

[02:54:11.920 --> 02:54:14.180]
That's what I thought of HOST, EO, I was in like, huh?

[02:54:14.460 --> 02:54:15.700]
I thought it was a movie about South Florida.

[02:54:16.060 --> 02:54:16.820]
Right, hostile.

[02:54:17.340 --> 02:54:18.520]
No, that one was called MALUS.

[02:54:18.740 --> 02:54:19.720]
That's what I was thinking about before.

[02:54:20.480 --> 02:54:22.560]
With MALUS toward all and the justice toward none,

[02:54:22.700 --> 02:54:23.180]
that's South Florida.

[02:54:23.640 --> 02:54:24.320]
It's just amazing.

[02:54:24.480 --> 02:54:26.140]
I'll go back to what, see, a lot of people

[02:54:26.140 --> 02:54:28.700]
all year so it's sour and you're such a carpet bagger.

[02:54:29.040 --> 02:54:32.640]
You know, 72% of the people I'm in love, they take like 400,000 votes

[02:54:32.640 --> 02:54:33.640]
on at SunCental Pool.

[02:54:34.140 --> 02:54:35.560]
It was like 6,7,000.

[02:54:36.240 --> 02:54:38.300]
And 72% that they either wandered out

[02:54:38.300 --> 02:54:39.820]
or they were working to get out, or they were definitely

[02:54:39.820 --> 02:54:40.680]
leaving South Florida.

[02:54:41.460 --> 02:54:41.820]
72%.

[02:54:41.820 --> 02:54:44.620]
That's not exactly amusing for the Chamber of Commerce's Rear.

[02:54:44.620 --> 02:54:47.120]
This is Neil Roger.

[02:54:47.280 --> 02:54:47.560]
Welcome.

[02:54:48.420 --> 02:54:51.280]
This is 5.62 AF.

[02:54:52.520 --> 02:54:54.540]
Watch mobs and butts and biting.

[02:54:56.200 --> 02:54:56.920]
Absolutely.

[02:54:57.640 --> 02:55:00.720]
I supported Bush after that project day

[02:55:00.720 --> 02:55:04.280]
and to my surprise, this custom shame

[02:55:04.280 --> 02:55:07.680]
he let the Saudis in the lady get away

[02:55:07.680 --> 02:55:11.200]
and shifted the blame to the dog who saved me.

[02:55:11.280 --> 02:55:12.180]
Right, right, right.

[02:55:12.360 --> 02:55:14.240]
We're up to pie in my rack.

[02:55:14.240 --> 02:55:15.260]
They have a bag.

[02:55:15.680 --> 02:55:17.760]
They're not the ones who are tired.

[02:55:18.140 --> 02:55:18.700]
They have a bag.

[02:55:19.140 --> 02:55:21.260]
What's going on with this bag?

[02:55:22.040 --> 02:55:22.040]

[02:55:22.660 --> 02:55:24.560]
They're what you're pie in my rack.

[02:55:24.960 --> 02:55:27.400]
Because all the workers are having a fine.

[02:55:27.760 --> 02:55:30.780]
As a strength, we've got good boy talent.

[02:55:31.080 --> 02:55:33.060]
You know, with lovely brothers

[02:55:33.060 --> 02:55:37.680]
that only just be time for the RGP and Hello Bertram.

[02:55:38.280 --> 02:55:41.760]
We believe in sending our kids to the DAW

[02:55:41.760 --> 02:55:43.340]
and we're doing love works.

[02:55:43.540 --> 02:55:46.160]
To support this guy in advance,

[02:55:46.340 --> 02:55:48.520]
they just simply must be the reason why.

[02:55:49.020 --> 02:55:51.540]
They believe George Williams is Jesus Christ.

[02:55:52.200 --> 02:55:52.340]
They're what?

[02:55:53.120 --> 02:55:54.900]
We're up to pie in my rack.

[02:55:55.080 --> 02:55:55.740]
They have a bag.

[02:55:56.420 --> 02:55:58.200]
They're not the ones who are tired.

[02:55:58.660 --> 02:55:59.160]
They have a bag.

[02:55:59.740 --> 02:56:01.700]
What's going on with this bag?

[02:56:02.260 --> 02:56:02.420]
They have a bag.

[02:56:03.180 --> 02:56:04.920]
They're what you're pie in my rack.

[02:56:05.440 --> 02:56:09.320]
Boy, George, why don't you take so many vacations?

[02:56:09.940 --> 02:56:10.800]
It's hard work.

[02:56:11.540 --> 02:56:12.360]
It's hard work.

[02:56:13.020 --> 02:56:14.240]
Everybody knows it's hard work.

[02:56:15.020 --> 02:56:16.400]
It was all out of hard work.

[02:56:17.040 --> 02:56:19.280]
I see on the TV screens how hard it is.

[02:56:20.640 --> 02:56:20.720]
Yeah.

[02:56:22.240 --> 02:56:24.680]
In Bearback, Mama, I discovered it was hard work too.

[02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:26.200]
146.14 built too.

[02:56:26.340 --> 02:56:26.980]
It's pretty sad.

[02:56:27.160 --> 02:56:28.400]
Pretty sad, America is like,

[02:56:28.560 --> 02:56:29.520]
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, like that.

[02:56:31.600 --> 02:56:33.380]
While all these innocent people are dying.

[02:56:33.500 --> 02:56:34.360]
For no reason whatsoever,

[02:56:34.620 --> 02:56:36.000]
but nevertheless, we've got a Wolflet's Creek under.

[02:56:36.100 --> 02:56:36.700]
Nice going, Eric.

[02:56:36.820 --> 02:56:37.600]
You've got the Wolflet's Creek.

[02:56:37.680 --> 02:56:38.960]
How a Dean Clip Bunner.

[02:56:38.960 --> 02:56:40.860]
Mark, and we'll move it down to where the other video stuff is

[02:56:40.860 --> 02:56:42.060]
when it loses its freshness.

[02:56:42.420 --> 02:56:42.820]
I see.

[02:56:43.440 --> 02:56:44.680]
OK, like a scurran.

[02:56:47.320 --> 02:56:48.280]
Well, that's what I heard.

[02:56:49.120 --> 02:56:51.160]
I heard he lost their freshness a few years ago.

[02:56:51.240 --> 02:56:52.140]
About 30, man.

[02:56:52.240 --> 02:56:52.420]
Yeah.

[02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:54.020]
Anyways, right under the pool.

[02:56:54.200 --> 02:56:55.000]
OK, take a look at it.

[02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:55.620]
It'll give you a chuckle.

[02:56:55.700 --> 02:56:57.320]
OK, to see how desperate Wolflet's Creek is.

[02:56:57.600 --> 02:57:00.500]
That goose stepping, a pedantic jackass on CNN.

[02:57:00.860 --> 02:57:01.520]
Yeah, I just watched it.

[02:57:01.520 --> 02:57:01.900]
It's pretty good.

[02:57:02.280 --> 02:57:02.640]
Yeah, good.

[02:57:02.840 --> 02:57:03.960]
I'll watch it right after the show.

[02:57:04.080 --> 02:57:05.020]
I don't want to give this back to them.

[02:57:05.100 --> 02:57:06.660]
We've got a big high-pay Joe here, man.

[02:57:07.960 --> 02:57:10.480]
And before we finish today, just to be not

[02:57:10.480 --> 02:57:12.600]
be outdone by Stern, we're going to say the F word.

[02:57:12.600 --> 02:57:13.280]
How do you like that?

[02:57:13.960 --> 02:57:16.200]
Byers Matter Effect already had a set of doing every break.

[02:57:17.600 --> 02:57:18.540]
I didn't say on the ear necessarily.

[02:57:19.120 --> 02:57:19.520]
Fondue.

[02:57:20.060 --> 02:57:23.240]
The round-of-clock availability that cell phones and pages have brought

[02:57:23.240 --> 02:57:25.940]
to people's lives may be taking a toll on family life.

[02:57:26.080 --> 02:57:29.760]
A new study suggests those who just love the people who take studies like this.

[02:57:30.900 --> 02:57:33.860]
The study was followed more than 1,300 adults over two years

[02:57:33.860 --> 02:57:37.700]
from those who consistently use a mobile phone or a pager throughout the study period

[02:57:37.700 --> 02:57:40.940]
were more likely to be for a negative spillover between work and home life

[02:57:40.940 --> 02:57:43.480]
and in turn less satisfaction with their family life.

[02:57:44.620 --> 02:57:47.640]
Spillover simply means that the line between work and home begins to blur.

[02:57:48.520 --> 02:57:51.660]
Work life may invade home life when a patient parent is taking

[02:57:51.660 --> 02:57:55.820]
job related calls at home, for example, or household issues may start to take up work time.

[02:57:56.740 --> 02:57:59.920]
In the latter scenario, a child may call mom at work not to say that he

[02:57:59.920 --> 02:58:02.520]
is English test, but that the microwave exploded.

[02:58:04.080 --> 02:58:07.180]
Yeah, the problem with cell phones and pagers seems to be that they're allowing

[02:58:07.180 --> 02:58:09.020]
forever more spillover between work and home.

[02:58:09.100 --> 02:58:09.880]
That's slop over.

[02:58:10.180 --> 02:58:12.680]
According to the findings published in the Journal of Marriage and Family,

[02:58:12.820 --> 02:58:16.940]
one of my favorite, not this maybe especially through for working women

[02:58:16.940 --> 02:58:17.500]
to study found.

[02:58:17.600 --> 02:58:20.720]
Among men, consistent use of mobile phones and pagers seem to allow more

[02:58:20.720 --> 02:58:24.260]
work issues to keep into family time, but for women to spill over tend to go

[02:58:24.260 --> 02:58:25.060]
in both directions.

[02:58:25.600 --> 02:58:29.540]
Being connected means that work cut into home time and family issues seeped

[02:58:29.540 --> 02:58:30.140]
in the work life.

[02:58:30.320 --> 02:58:30.860]
It's a steeper man.

[02:58:31.400 --> 02:58:32.980]
Nothing worse than having a seeping problem.

[02:58:33.900 --> 02:58:34.780]
Did I arrive at?

[02:58:35.340 --> 02:58:36.160]
Just this morning?

[02:58:36.540 --> 02:58:36.960]
Oh man.

[02:58:37.400 --> 02:58:38.940]
Yeah, we already heard about the Moose Tracks.

[02:58:40.180 --> 02:58:43.640]
Despite a widely held belief that neocons, many of them Jewish,

[02:58:43.780 --> 02:58:48.420]
are behind the war in Iraq about 70% of American Jews now oppose the war,

[02:58:48.820 --> 02:58:51.080]
according to a new survey released by the American Jewish Committee.

[02:58:51.760 --> 02:58:57.980]
And that guy in Israel, Meshipipik, the survey also found that 60% of Jews in the West

[02:58:57.980 --> 02:59:00.420]
did not approve the Bush administration's handling of the campaign against

[02:59:00.420 --> 02:59:00.660]
terrorism.

[02:59:00.960 --> 02:59:01.820]
How come it's only 60?

[02:59:02.020 --> 02:59:03.060]
How to be like 95?

[02:59:04.560 --> 02:59:04.820]
You know what?

[02:59:04.820 --> 02:59:08.780]
Back in 2002, before the Iraq war, almost 60% of American Jews approved

[02:59:08.780 --> 02:59:12.220]
a Bush's handling of terrorism and supported military action moved Sodom.

[02:59:12.860 --> 02:59:15.180]
The Jewish publication of Ford reports.

[02:59:15.640 --> 02:59:20.240]
But by the fall of 2003, after the Iraq attack, only 43% of Jews in the West

[02:59:20.240 --> 02:59:23.580]
approved the war, and 41% had a favorable view of the campaign against

[02:59:23.580 --> 02:59:24.000]
terrorism.

[02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:28.800]
And the latest poll conducted by market facts only 28% that they support the war,

[02:59:29.200 --> 02:59:30.000]
28% of Jews.

[02:59:30.800 --> 02:59:32.120]
And you know who they are, don't you?

[02:59:32.200 --> 02:59:33.540]
It's like Jew Lieberman.

[02:59:34.960 --> 02:59:37.500]
And Richard, all those are right-wingers.

[02:59:37.600 --> 02:59:39.500]
And Miss Drudge, self-hating queens.

[02:59:40.520 --> 02:59:43.860]
Among those poll, 26% said they're, this is the thing I find amazing.

[02:59:44.860 --> 02:59:48.560]
26% said they're extremely conservative, conservative, or slightly conservative,

[02:59:48.920 --> 02:59:52.100]
29% said they're moderate, which means that 45% said they're liberal.

[02:59:52.920 --> 02:59:54.060]
And that surprised you?

[02:59:54.740 --> 02:59:56.340]
Well, I forgot that liberal is a dirty word now.

[02:59:56.880 --> 02:59:59.780]
Sorry, 40% said they're not like that.

[03:00:00.820 --> 03:00:02.980]
Forkot, what was the word that God kept using forklempt?

[03:00:03.300 --> 03:00:03.700]
Forklempt.

[03:00:03.940 --> 03:00:04.540]
They're forklempt.

[03:00:05.860 --> 03:00:06.920]
Oh, I'm speaking to Jews.

[03:00:07.140 --> 03:00:09.080]
Let's start to do a whole Jewish show segment here.

[03:00:09.140 --> 03:00:09.520]
What do you say?

[03:00:10.040 --> 03:00:10.340]
Boy!

[03:00:10.780 --> 03:00:11.220]
You go, girl.

[03:00:11.840 --> 03:00:16.180]
Everyone who worships at the Tabernacle quickly learns three facts about its deeply conservative

[03:00:16.180 --> 03:00:17.580]
pastor in Danville, Virginia.

[03:00:17.880 --> 03:00:19.100]
He comes from a broken home.

[03:00:19.400 --> 03:00:20.680]
He rides a canary yellow Harley.

[03:00:20.680 --> 03:00:21.760]
And he loves the Jews.

[03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:23.180]
He's like Barbara Stubley.

[03:00:23.520 --> 03:00:24.540]
I love the Jewish people.

[03:00:24.660 --> 03:00:25.820]
I love my love, my love.

[03:00:26.820 --> 03:00:28.840]
Feet, she actually was saying that on the early night.

[03:00:28.960 --> 03:00:29.660]
I mean, just that way.

[03:00:29.760 --> 03:00:31.180]
I love my love, the Jewish people.

[03:00:31.480 --> 03:00:33.180]
And she, oh boy.

[03:00:33.780 --> 03:00:36.580]
She also loves Senator Hill in the kitchen, but nevertheless.

[03:00:37.060 --> 03:00:40.320]
There's some murmuring about the motorcycle, but the 2500 members of this Bible,

[03:00:40.320 --> 03:00:43.860]
believing, traditionally expecting Southern Baptist Church in Southern Virginia,

[03:00:44.180 --> 03:00:46.880]
haven't raised everything else about the Reverend Lamar, Mooney Ham.

[03:00:49.200 --> 03:00:50.000]
That's his name.

[03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:50.900]
Mooney Ham.

[03:00:50.920 --> 03:00:52.320]
Mooney Ham or Mooney Ham?

[03:00:52.460 --> 03:00:57.520]
Mooney Ham with an M. Ham is an asian band eggs.

[03:00:58.360 --> 03:01:03.040]
Out of his painful childhood experiences, Mooney Ham 57, preaches passionately about the importance

[03:01:03.040 --> 03:01:03.440]
of home.

[03:01:03.760 --> 03:01:06.660]
Out of his reading of the Bible, he preaches with equal passion about God's continuing

[03:01:06.660 --> 03:01:08.220]
devotion to the Jewish people.

[03:01:08.740 --> 03:01:09.680]
And God's devoted to him.

[03:01:09.720 --> 03:01:12.480]
That's why somebody even has been slaughtered throughout the years because he likes testing

[03:01:12.480 --> 03:01:13.380]
everybody all the time.

[03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:14.620]
How's that test going?

[03:01:15.020 --> 03:01:15.840]
Not too good.

[03:01:16.500 --> 03:01:17.100]
Can they yet?

[03:01:17.460 --> 03:01:17.820]
No.

[03:01:18.600 --> 03:01:22.780]
I feel jealous sometimes this term that keeps coming up in the old book, The Chosen, The Chosen,

[03:01:22.980 --> 03:01:26.860]
since the minister was made, three tricks to Israel, and named his son Isaac Jacob and Joseph.

[03:01:27.580 --> 03:01:30.300]
I'm a pardoned Gentile, but I'm not one of the chosen people.

[03:01:30.560 --> 03:01:31.760]
They're the apple of his eye.

[03:01:32.880 --> 03:01:35.100]
I think he probably means some of them are right into the core.

[03:01:37.140 --> 03:01:41.660]
Scholars of religion called this worldwide, final cemeterism, the opposite of anti-semitism.

[03:01:41.960 --> 03:01:45.840]
It's a burgeoning phenomenon in an evangelical Christian churches across the country,

[03:01:45.840 --> 03:01:50.720]
a hot topic in Jewish historical studies, and a wellspring of support for Israel, and

[03:01:50.720 --> 03:01:53.700]
that guy over there who's breathing on his own today, breathing heavily, but nevertheless,

[03:01:54.700 --> 03:01:59.480]
and many Jews are nervous about evangelicals and tensions in recent weeks, leaders of three

[03:01:59.480 --> 03:02:03.060]
of the nation's largest Jewish groups, the anti-deformation, the American Jewish committee,

[03:02:03.180 --> 03:02:07.000]
and the union for reform Judaism, have decried what they see as a mounting threat to the

[03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:10.620]
separation of church and state from evangelicals emboldened by the belief they have an ally

[03:02:10.620 --> 03:02:13.180]
in the White House and a chance to shift the Supreme Court.

[03:02:13.180 --> 03:02:17.900]
Make no mistake, we're facing an emerging Christian right leadership that intends to

[03:02:17.900 --> 03:02:21.520]
Christianize all aspects of American life from the halls of government to the libraries,

[03:02:21.520 --> 03:02:24.660]
to the movies to recording studios, to the playing fields in locker rooms,

[03:02:24.960 --> 03:02:29.860]
from the military to SpongeBob SquarePants, the ADL's National Director Abraham H. Foxman

[03:02:29.860 --> 03:02:32.760]
said in November 3rds, but I didn't even know SpongeBob was Jewish.

[03:02:33.120 --> 03:02:35.240]
This is Neil Rogers.

[03:02:36.100 --> 03:02:39.620]
This is 5.62 A.M.

[03:02:42.360 --> 03:02:43.540]
tracks 2.04

[03:02:43.540 --> 03:02:43.540]

[03:02:43.680 --> 03:02:53.440]
St. Jeb zuys

[03:02:53.440 --> 03:02:54.580]
Big,

[03:02:54.580 --> 03:02:56.420]
For the place we know

[03:02:57.780 --> 03:02:59.940]
And name a madame fell

[03:03:00.900 --> 03:03:03.420]
Whose first name begins with us

[03:03:04.660 --> 03:03:08.300]
There's one thing we all understand

[03:03:11.760 --> 03:03:14.180]
Alcatamone will be finished

[03:03:14.820 --> 03:03:16.760]
Until we blow up Pakistan

[03:03:19.940 --> 03:03:22.660]
We could chase him round forever

[03:03:23.620 --> 03:03:25.980]
With our tanks and all our troops

[03:03:26.820 --> 03:03:29.460]
With special forces our retired

[03:03:30.660 --> 03:03:33.080]
Of jumping through them moves

[03:03:33.080 --> 03:03:33.740]
Stop, stop

[03:03:33.740 --> 03:03:38.040]
You told me need another place

[03:03:39.680 --> 03:03:40.520]
Absolutely

[03:03:40.520 --> 03:03:43.200]
So let's cut out all the nonsense

[03:03:44.180 --> 03:03:46.200]

I think he's still dead

[03:04:19.380 --> 03:04:20.620]
I think he's alive, I don't know

[03:04:21.100 --> 03:04:22.440]
574 votes on the poll today

[03:04:22.960 --> 03:04:24.140]

Here's a good reason to stay tuned to see if Moe is as surly as I'm told he was on Friday

[03:04:27.420 --> 03:04:30.160]
To see if the hangover lasted the tongue over for the weekend

[03:04:31.580 --> 03:04:35.580]

Oh

[03:04:43.520 --> 03:04:44.880]
Here's our poll so far today

[03:04:44.880 --> 03:04:46.000]
What's you have to answer this?

[03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:47.160]
We're awfully cynical

[03:04:47.160 --> 03:04:50.900]
You know most people are just average run of the mill people just trying to make a living

[03:04:50.900 --> 03:04:51.620]
Must for the 11

[03:04:52.200 --> 03:04:52.460]

No, that was your vote

[03:05:00.360 --> 03:05:02.080]
That was even more cynical than you were

[03:05:02.080 --> 03:05:03.700]
170 say stupid

[03:05:03.700 --> 03:05:05.080]
Decent 109

[03:05:05.080 --> 03:05:07.320]
See there is there is the nice genteel gentile approach

[03:05:07.320 --> 03:05:08.360]
Most people are decent

[03:05:08.360 --> 03:05:08.960]
They're okay

[03:05:09.700 --> 03:05:11.140]
