[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560]
Let's check it out. Boy, they're gonna be, you think they're gonna be upset?

[00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.600]
Ah! Who was it, girl? This is me, Waylamin!

[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.440]
And a secret word today is...

[00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:14.680]
Transvestite!

[00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.600]
Huh?

[00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.500]
On a scale of ten, I'll give that about a minus eight.

[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.120]
Sweet, bad and salad thought for dinner and for lunch.

[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.720]
Week. Now here's a good one. This would talk about big and high alia.

[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.000]
And high alia and sweet water, Pee Wee would be number one with this kind of stuff.

[00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.820]
Ah! Who was it, girl? This is me, Waylamin!

[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.340]
And a secret word today is...

[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.100]
Cockfile!

[00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.360]
The number one half, if you had a pirate station and played at in the high alia, right?

[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.080]
And about ten grand of bed on it.

[00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.300]
Do you think this mobile Steve here on the Starline?

[00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.100]
Hey, Dale. Yeah.

[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.660]
I think it can't flip your show much in, uh, yesterday.

[00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.360]
Yeah. Who bad, go out on a great show yesterday?

[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.720]
Yeah. The market's down eight and a half points.

[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.360]
Did anybody call?

[00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.100]
Did anybody call about, uh, Monday Night Football?

[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.520]
What about it?

[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.380]
Did you see it?

[00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.920]
No.

[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.800]
You missed, uh, allows you game with real, allows you appreciate.

[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:20.400]
Yeah, we know.

[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.280]
Yeah. That was probably the worst I've ever seen.

[00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.700]
Ever.

[00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.560]
Yeah. You didn't miss, you missed it all, huh?

[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.660]
I had no interest in it. Why would I watch the...

[00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.380]
I knew the Bengals would beat the cramp out of the grounds.

[00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.120]
Why watch it?

[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.080]
Two very, two very boring teams.

[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.500]
Yeah.

[00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.880]
There was a, it was a boring game, but uh, the officiating was exciting.

[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.420]
Yeah.

[00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:39.240]
That's what I heard.

[00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.500]
I heard it took them five minutes to figure out what down it was.

[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.200]
Yeah, that was one part, but uh, then they made up some rules, though, right there.

[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.960]
Oh, that's good.

[00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.580]
Yeah, they're trying to make it a little more exciting.

[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.760]
Yeah, I guess the rules are now written in pencil.

[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.400]
Uh-huh.

[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.600]
Anyway, all right, that's about all I had to say.

[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.680]
Sorry I missed it.

[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.920]
Yeah.

[00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.860]
Thanks.

[00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.460]
Maybe next time.

[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.700]
Yeah.

[00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.420]
Now Spencer, what do you want?

[00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.320]
Give you what?

[00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.780]
You want to, you want to do something to the side of my car with my key?

[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.220]
Yeah.

[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.040]
How to see it?

[00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.000]
Yeah, key this.

[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.440]
I got your key right here, Spencer.

[00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.340]
You're giving me, you're giving me coffee.

[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.940]
Oh, quit acting like such a child.

[00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.080]
Will you grow up already?

[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.180]
I thought you didn't want me to do your car anymore, Neil.

[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.880]
Grow up, will you act like a man?

[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.300]
Like he said in the Godfather, remember Marlon Brando?

[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.140]
He slapped El Martino in a face act like a me a man.

[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.000]
Grow up, what's up?

[00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.220]
And don't mess up my car Spencer under penalty of death.

[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.880]
We'll sit you in Sally, Finss is cheerful two hours.

[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.800]
It's worse than Bundy.

[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.760]
Anyway, it's 1029 and WI-O-D.

[00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.740]
We got three calls on the board already this morning.

[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:46.720]
We're off and running, right?

[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.440]
We're doing it.

[00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.260]
Also last night, speaking of TV,

[00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.240]
were we speaking of TV, WI-O-U-D?

[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.380]
They had a thing on the Disney Channel, which I bet you there isn't one person in this audience.

[00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.240]
I saw once before, but I watched it again.

[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.800]
And it was a David Nelson documentary about his brother,

[00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:04.560]
about Ricky Nelson.

[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.080]
Did anybody see it?

[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.800]
Am I the only one in this entire audience in this entire community?

[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.220]
We saw it on the Disney last night.

[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.300]
It was pretty good.

[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.760]
I've been needing the word to say,

[00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.080]
when you say it on stage,

[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.100]
nobody else would need it.

[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.280]
And in the last couple of minutes, they had Rick Nelson's daughter.

[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.840]
What is your name?

[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.320]
Christie.

[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.600]
Christie McNichol, Jr.

[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.920]
And she's cute.

[00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.920]
I don't know what she does,

[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.680]
but she was on there talking about her dad.

[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.680]
And then they had the Nelson twins on there.

[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.960]
From, and this thing was from like three, four years ago.

[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.400]
And boy, I'll tell you,

[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.340]
they had to revive me with oxygen after I saw that segment.

[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.200]
Man, unbelievable.

[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.740]
It was pretty good, but I'm sure nobody else saw it.

[00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.320]
And how about the, how about the Randy Martenshow?

[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.980]
Wouldn't you think if this was any kind of a community at all,

[00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.660]
knowing the tremendous popularity of that program,

[00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.440]
that as soon as I mentioned that it,

[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.660]
like 1007 this morning,

[00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:56.960]
every line should have been lit.

[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.820]
Everybody in this audience should have been critiquing that show last night.

[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.880]
Sick career, but desert.

[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.940]
Don't give our a map.

[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.400]
Okay, but they don't care.

[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.280]
Let's take a call from Boca.

[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.200]
Hi, Newly.

[00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.740]
Yeah.

[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.560]
How you doing?

[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.120]
Okay.

[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.140]
What are we going to do with those women in the locker room?

[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.340]
What are you going to do?

[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.420]
I'm not going to do anything with them.

[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.900]
What about you?

[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.320]
I don't know.

[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.320]
What should we do with them?

[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.160]
Well, if the cart would have queued up again,

[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.800]
I could have told you, but it hasn't queued up yet.

[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.320]
Okay.

[00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.480]
Well, I got something for you, no?

[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.600]
I'm listening.

[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.760]
Okay. Well, that sperm bank was it.

[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.420]
Let's go to a dear field beach.

[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.660]
Hello.

[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.920]
Yeah, I was a,

[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.940]
I was a chronic in.

[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.840]
I was wondering about the double standard of justice.

[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.520]
That was Stein's column today.

[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.580]
Now during the 10th thing, he wouldn't obey the judge,

[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.240]
but he's going to obey the judge until I've crewed.

[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.240]

[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.480]
But there's another article there about Jay Leno.

[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.020]
How he gets his material for his books from the newspaper.

[00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.240]
Oh, God.

[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.760]
But, uh, hey, Leno.

[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.560]
On the front page of the Sun Sentinel.

[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.020]
What is the story with Jay Leno?

[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.060]
I read the list of the Jay Michaels and he's not even on anymore.

[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.000]
Yeah, the lantern, Judd, comedian.

[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:06.660]
Terrible, awful.

[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.520]
But it's never said a funny thing in his life.

[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.900]
But there's a big, the big headline on the front of the Sun Sentinel is about

[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.200]
the thing that they know is real, not letting their ribs in.

[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.240]
Don't give them a map.

[00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.760]
Yeah, they killed a bunch of Palestinians yesterday to get even.

[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.280]
They just still, you know, yeah, but then he's right over there at the end of the fall.

[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.200]
They put the sections of the back page and there's a full page ad by L L L.

[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.180]
Come stay with friends.

[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.880]
Yeah, right.

[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.260]
And I just thought that that's I right.

[00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.800]
Yeah, my mother yesterday says to me, she said, boy,

[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.280]
tourism's really hurting over there.

[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.360]
I said, that's a real surprise.

[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.480]
That's a shock.

[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.320]
I understand Bay Rune doing too good either.

[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.360]
The Bay Rune Hilton.

[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.800]
Well, you know, it's it's a.

[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.340]
And how about the Saudis, man, they hear Saddam Hussein goes in and he rips the whole country apart

[00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.780]
and Kuwait tear it just devastates, trashes the whole country, kills all the people,

[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.320]
destroys the whole country.

[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.860]
That was, hey, listen, we'll give you a little piece.

[00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.060]
We got Maddie Hall with us.

[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.540]
We got plenty.

[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.220]
Maddie Hall was on today with Joe Dodgiollo this morning.

[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.260]
He's coming back on NBC.

[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.020]
Maybe he can be the negotiator.

[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.360]
Maddie Hall?

[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:03.880]
Yeah.

[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.920]
He's already doing it.

[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.560]
Nobody's well, yeah.

[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.300]
He's already on. Well, I know.

[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.600]
But I mean, he's already on.

[00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.700]
But he's back temporarily.

[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.280]
He said they brought it back to give it a big send-off.

[00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.900]
Yeah.

[00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.980]
It's called.

[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.920]
He looks like he looks like Rick Weaver.

[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.360]
He got the same that white here now.

[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.800]
He looks just like Rick Weaver and drag.

[00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.640]
I can believe it.

[00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.520]
And he brought his own chair with him too.

[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:22.320]
I was just thinking.

[00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.060]
That's why he's always standing up on it, Choke.

[00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.500]
There's only one chair he'll sit in.

[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.120]
Listen, and as far as Iran goes, I guess if no one here is, no one can come in.

[00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.120]
Now, there were people listening.

[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.960]
Believe me.

[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.280]
And I don't want to hear from that one guy,

[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.400]
her son-in-law, who that is that calls her.

[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.560]
Oh, she's so great.

[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.900]
You're back.

[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.120]
I want to hear some honest answers, you know.

[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.980]
I can see it's going to be.

[00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.040]
We had a great Monday this week for some reason.

[00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:45.660]
And then yesterday was a pretty active,

[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.620]
but today's Wednesday.

[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.020]
And they're just not going to play the game day.

[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.480]
And you know what?

[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.280]
I don't care because I feel great today.

[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:50.900]
You're centered.

[00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.180]
I feel outstanding.

[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.140]
I don't know why.

[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.840]
Probably because the gate...

[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.240]
The gate is Toronto.

[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.280]
Probably because the blinds are closed

[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.200]
in the control room.

[00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.380]
And I can't see Boy Geary or anything.

[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.340]
No, leave them closed.

[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.700]
I like it much better this way.

[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.600]
You can't feel great because it's Toronto.

[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.320]
Who?

[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:05.740]
Yeah, those are...

[00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:06.540]
Have a great day, sir.

[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.020]
See you later.

[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:07.360]
Okay.

[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.000]
We don't talk hockey on this show.

[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.200]
1033 at WIOD.

[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:12.860]
We got three lines.

[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.400]
Let I'm not going to love beg for calls

[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.280]
or give the numbers today.

[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:16.280]
Because I feel outstanding.

[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.160]
And of course, say an ad.

[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:17.640]
Look at Dave.

[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:18.120]
Nothing.

[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:18.900]
Zippity-nuda.

[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:19.540]
Okay.

[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:20.780]
We love you, too.

[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:21.760]
I still away.

[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:22.800]
Go get on the rubber ramp.

[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:23.400]
Adios.

[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.520]
We got your passport right here, pal.

[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.120]
We have a...

[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:31.760]
Now what does that mean?

[00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.000]
I was going to take the break,

[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.020]
but I'm so fascinated.

[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.740]
I don't want to lose that call on six.

[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:36.540]
Hello.

[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:37.760]
Hello.

[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:38.520]
Yes.

[00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:39.780]
Is this Neil?

[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:41.960]
It's a spastic female on the board.

[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.260]
That's what George wrote about you.

[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.540]
What makes you spastic?

[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.600]
Neil, I wanted to tell you.

[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.320]
I always thought you were a ditch bag.

[00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.360]
And my boyfriend got me listening to you.

[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.600]
And now I think you're wonderful.

[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:53.740]
Isn't that something, huh?

[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:54.620]
Isn't that a myth?

[00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.380]
How your boyfriend can kind of change your direction.

[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.940]
Every day of my life.

[00:07:59.000 --> 00:07:59.280]
Yeah.

[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.720]
Up, down, backwards.

[00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:01.960]
Yeah, that's what we heard.

[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:03.760]
Ugh.

[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.200]
Are you going to be okay?

[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.820]
Um, I think so.

[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.780]
So Neil, how about some dog-

[00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.860]
You know that in a former life, she used to be a, uh,

[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.160]
airplane propeller.

[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.360]
What is it?

[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.000]
Wait, I don't have any tickets to give away.

[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.460]
That's what the whole audience is waiting for.

[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.680]
They don't want to waste their call down

[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.760]
because they figure out playing...

[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.060]
I got nothing to give away today.

[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.340]
I'm not buying the audience anymore,

[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.180]
but if I had, am I giving to you and your boyfriend?

[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.300]
How about some food?

[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.320]
I got your food right here, baby.

[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.120]
What do you want?

[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.000]
There she goes.

[00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:33.580]
That's it.

[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:34.940]
She couldn't handle it, okay?

[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:36.820]
Well, I was pretty good,

[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.000]
but that's about as brave as she could get for today.

[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:39.380]
Look at that.

[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.860]
Two calls on that whole board.

[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:41.840]
Are you ready?

[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:42.660]
And guess what?

[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.600]
We got this whole thing cute up here.

[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:45.800]
No, and I Rick Nelson.

[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:46.500]
Get him out of there.

[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:47.340]
He's not feeling too good.

[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.220]
He was great.

[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.460]
Nobody saw that either.

[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:51.720]
Nobody is in anything today.

[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.160]
Okay?

[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:53.220]
Then bother me.

[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.160]
We got all the Rick and Suds material right here.

[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:56.640]
How about this one?

[00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:57.280]
Just a second.

[00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.280]
Stick around the desert.

[00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.860]
Coming soon to a theater near you.

[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.640]
He's been on the road with YouTube for 12 years.

[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.580]
Playing guitar and writing songs.

[00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.580]
But he really misses his mom.

[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.000]
And only she gets postcards from the edge.

[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.120]
Dear mom, how are you?

[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:17.280]
I am fine.

[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:18.920]
Wish you could write back.

[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.380]
I don't have an interest.

[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.820]
Because I'm wearing the streets.

[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.080]
Have no names.

[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.540]
Move the edge.

[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.100]
A film inspired by the genius of YouTube's

[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.040]
the edge's writings.

[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.080]
It's postcards from the edge.

[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.280]
Dear mom, follow that jerk.

[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.880]
Says you are drunk when you named me.

[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:36.120]
Cump the edge.

[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:36.860]
PS.

[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.540]
Busy schedule ahead.

[00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:40.040]
Hook through Christmas.

[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.960]
All is quiet under your day.

[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:43.420]
Week.

[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.060]
Really, week.

[00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.640]
Almost as weak as YouTube's music.

[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:47.140]
Yeah.

[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:48.780]
Oh, man.

[00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.820]
That's what I've missed about having stand on the year the most.

[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.120]
Okay, stands a great guy.

[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.540]
But his taste in music on a scale of zero.

[00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:56.600]
The best.

[00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:58.560]
It's glorious.

[00:09:59.360 --> 00:09:59.920]
Right?

[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:00.840]
Yeah.

[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.240]
Randy Marge sucks.

[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.020]
Well, listen, at least he was right to the point.

[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:07.400]
Okay.

[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.280]
I like people who are directed.

[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.380]
Don't beat around a bush.

[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.480]
Sixth career, the desert.

[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:13.640]
Oh, man.

[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.480]
Don't give our a man.

[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.160]
Anyway, it's 19 to 11.

[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:17.840]
A good old W.

[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.000]
There's only one Frank Sinatra.

[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.740]
And now Krapco introduces his latest live album.

[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.220]
Perfectly, Frank.

[00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.160]
This one goes out for that crazy Irish broad,

[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.580]
Shine Herald Connor.

[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.460]
She gets stranger every night.

[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.680]
She's taking chances as our anthem fights.

[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.540]
I got the answer.

[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.620]
Send the broad back home.

[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.620]
Maybe she'll change her tune.

[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.780]
Old blue eyes tells it like it is.

[00:10:55.780 --> 00:11:00.560]
Shane, go, shane, go back where you belong.

[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.400]
He's the chairman of the board.

[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.580]
And you will be too when you hear perfectly Frank.

[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.480]
She shapes her heads.

[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.560]
Each morning at eight.

[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:19.080]
And she don't even think that the star spangled banner

[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:20.500]
to create.

[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.200]
Stink career, the desert.

[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.240]
And don't give our a man.

[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.920]
If Frank Sinatra, live, live it, and perfectly Frank.

[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.000]
I think the lady will have Krapco.

[00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.800]
Today, baby, no one compares to you.

[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.460]
Thank God.

[00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.420]
Okay, 1117 at WID.

[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.200]
Can't wait for that Larry King special.

[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.980]
I'm sure that everybody in this audience is on the edge of their seat.

[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:50.980]
Roger brought me in the thing.

[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.080]
I have no idea what magazine this is from a clipping.

[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.960]
All about Larry King's NBC special.

[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.980]
This Sunday, 28th man, is that going to be great or what?

[00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:03.980]
And Larry says it's a shame that variety shows have gone out of style.

[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.380]
Will a special change all of that?

[00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:07.580]
They ask he says, I don't know.

[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.060]
I've been in the industry 30 years.

[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.940]
And the big secret is nobody knows a damn thing.

[00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:12.980]
I'd never do it that.

[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:13.780]
That's what he says.

[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.900]
Boy, you've got to miss that or what, huh?

[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.660]
God, you could dance the kazansky right on his schnauz easy.

[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.460]
Miami.

[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:21.660]
Hello.

[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:22.300]
Hi.

[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.540]
Hi, I'm a first time caller.

[00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:25.080]
Great.

[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.940]
This is Terandi for a little while last night while I was wandering last on the turn.

[00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.620]
She was great, wasn't she?

[00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:31.440]
Oh, tremendous.

[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.640]
Something that you had to be there.

[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.820]
She was talking about a letter that she received air mail from the Bahamas.

[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:43.620]
A pornographic letter by gentleman who described his body in great detail.

[00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.300]
And she was going to save it as evidence.

[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.520]
So I think we need to hear this.

[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.360]
She was going to save it as evidence of what?

[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:51.320]
I don't know.

[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.440]
She wanted to let the guy know that she was going to save it.

[00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.360]
Yeah, she's saving it all right.

[00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.780]
Well, I could only take her.

[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.120]
But then I switched over to Jerry Wittner for a moment.

[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.360]
I had a radio accident.

[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:04.960]
Yeah.

[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.060]
But he was talking about something that maybe you know about.

[00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.060]
That one time, a guy ran over him with a truck.

[00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:11.300]
Oh, I wish.

[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:15.100]
He was saying that it really happened that a guy called him and threatened him.

[00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:18.780]
And then when he was leaving work that night, he was actually run over by a truck.

[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.800]
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

[00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:23.080]
I thought so too.

[00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:24.660]
I'd like to see that Camillean, uh,

[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.740]
rugga, his changing color that night.

[00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:27.460]
How can you imagine?

[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.200]
How old is he anyway?

[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.820]
Wittner, 163.

[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:31.700]
I thought so.

[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:32.820]
You can hear him.

[00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:32.820]

[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.500]
He talks about all that time he was in the war.

[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:35.780]
He's talking about the Civil War.

[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:36.420]
Exactly.

[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.200]
I don't have to tell you which side he was on.

[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:38.540]
Do I?

[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:39.780]
Oh, no kidding.

[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:40.220]
Yeah.

[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.360]
That could have been slave days.

[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.520]
That's why he likes driving that Dixie highway.

[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:45.700]
Yeah, and is that...

[00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:46.260]
If you catch my drift.

[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:47.760]
What does he call his motorcycle?

[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.540]
Does he have a name for his motorcycle?

[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:51.960]
Oh, it's a crotch rocket.

[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:52.940]
Crotch rocket?

[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:53.580]
Yeah.

[00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:54.660]
Crotch rocket.

[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:55.640]
Mm-hmm.

[00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.240]
Well, when you get to be that old, I guess it starts sitting in, you know?

[00:13:58.380 --> 00:13:59.040]
That's our guy.

[00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.580]
So anyway, I guess Jerry and Randy are neck and neck.

[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.760]
So to speak, nose to nose.

[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.500]
If Jerry was on against Larry King, they'd be nose to nose.

[00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:08.960]
I'm a, I'm a, I don't know.

[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.140]
Love me $50.

[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:11.680]
Right.

[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.840]
Well, you're going to watch that show Sunday night,

[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.040]
the Larry King Variety show?

[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.280]
I don't think I can...

[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.620]
Man, is that going to be a gut-wrenching show?

[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:19.780]
Don't eat a big dinner Sunday.

[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:23.980]
I had enough of him during the Seattle game.

[00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.040]
I couldn't take it when he was doing the TV thing.

[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.600]
Oh, that Ted Turner crap, yeah.

[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.280]
Oh, God.

[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.460]
And the sporting events were not bad, but I just couldn't take it.

[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:33.760]
Yeah, he can do it, man.

[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.400]
If you want to go on a diet of nutritionism,

[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.100]
isn't enough just to watch his show?

[00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:37.720]
Exactly.

[00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:38.920]
It was terminal.

[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:39.860]
Have a great life.

[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:40.300]
You too.

[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:41.920]
Talk about it.

[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:42.440]
You have two things?

[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:43.660]
Well, that's a good story.

[00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:44.320]
No, for real.

[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.920]
The first thing, the Citramami cops,

[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.620]
the Latin cops, they're prejudiced against everybody.

[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:50.960]
Sticker in the dead.

[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:51.680]
I'm serious.

[00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.620]
You see that 7-Eleven file for a bankruptcy yesterday?

[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.960]
Now, doesn't that tell you people at farm stores,

[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.620]
you better govern yourselves accordingly

[00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.060]
and see the handwriting on the wall,

[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.820]
like Daniel and the Lions, then, okay?

[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:02.960]
Let me ask you something here, yet.

[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.020]
That's what happens when you take out those highly profitable playboys

[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.420]
in Penthouse and Hustler and all those other disgusting,

[00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:09.940]
grotesque, wonderful magazines.

[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.000]
You start going in a crapper, okay?

[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:14.960]
So thank heaven for 7-Eleven going bust.

[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:16.740]
Nobody deserves it more than they do.

[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.900]
And those right-wing religious nuts from plant city.

[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.340]
Okay, that's my first day.

[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:23.640]
Neil?

[00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:24.580]
And Chris Sabo.

[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.140]
Do you ever see Chris Sabo Raymond Berry

[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:27.660]
and Todd from the newsroom together?

[00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:28.060]
No.

[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:29.200]
What does that tell you?

[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:30.680]
Go ahead, I'm sorry.

[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:31.340]
Okay, Neil.

[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.480]
That's my first thing I was upset about my second day.

[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:33.960]
Oh, what?

[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:33.960]

[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:34.480]
The pigs?

[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:34.920]
They're cops.

[00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:36.460]
They're sitting by me cop, they're Latin cops.

[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:37.860]
That's a lot of that.

[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.620]
I think that everybody's trying to have it more.

[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.260]
So I don't know, every time he gets pulled over,

[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:41.840]
he's happy,

[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:42.980]
majorly.

[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:44.020]
Yeah.

[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:44.740]
Okay.

[00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:45.800]
That's the first thing.

[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:46.540]
My second thing is,

[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:47.620]
I don't know if you like soccer,

[00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:49.500]
but the United States team has a good soccer.

[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:50.280]
Do I like chocolate?

[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:50.860]
Soccer.

[00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:52.180]
Soccer.

[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:52.800]
You know, with a...

[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.780]
Oh, jeez.

[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.140]
The USA has a good soccer team.

[00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:55.800]
Every time they play.

[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:56.440]
Soccer is sucks.

[00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.320]
Yeah, but don't you respect United?

[00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:00.540]
The little guys running around and showing the whole country.

[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:01.740]
They keep picking the wall out of bounds

[00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:03.580]
and the referee keeps waving his little hanky.

[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.820]
I wonder why he said hanky in the left pocket, too, by the way.

[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:07.780]
Have you ever wondered about that?

[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:08.900]
No, but I was wondering.

[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:09.940]
Let me tell you.

[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:11.920]
Walter, they wear the earring in their right ear

[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.360]
and they keep the hanky in their left pocket.

[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.760]
I think that's like a little message.

[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:16.500]
Why don't they support their own team?

[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.420]
United has a good team.

[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.000]
They may own the way.

[00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.740]
They literally the world cup the first time ever.

[00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:21.060]
And every time they play over here,

[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.020]
they're always pulling their stance.

[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:23.940]
Full of footers for the team, for the other team,

[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:24.640]
for the Latin team.

[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.940]
Half of the people in America is like half the people.

[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:29.720]
Yeah.

[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.520]
I mean, maybe you should promote a little bit of soccer.

[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:35.300]
You don't have to take JRS in 1994.

[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:36.520]
The world cup's going to be here.

[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:37.480]
OK, you feel better?

[00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.480]
I feel I hope from now to 94,

[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.360]
to every once in a while, I feel some about soccer.

[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:42.020]
You feel better?

[00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:42.900]
I feel better.

[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:43.240]
OK.

[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:43.920]
Thanks for that, buddy.

[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:44.860]
All right, we're going to start.

[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.780]
Down tonight, what will you do?

[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.960]
Here's the dignity, battle, bitty,

[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.560]
and my city, not as old as that.

[00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:56.740]
But she shirt as printing.

[00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.300]
Oh, I tell you, it's quite a bit deep.

[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:01.620]
Lift the none alone, none, stutter, secure, tick.

[00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:02.780]
She's not texting.

[00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.020]
It's the true set up.

[00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:06.300]
Walked in by the door in her brand new get up.

[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:06.760]
She trips.

[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:07.360]
She falls.

[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:08.360]
She tries to call.

[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.660]
I fall in it.

[00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:10.580]
And I can't get up.

[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.420]
Oh, I fall in it.

[00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:13.480]
And I can't get up.

[00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:15.800]
Yo, man, didn't I see you in one time?

[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:16.860]
I'll make you a nod.

[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:20.520]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, me and the crew used to polo then blue her.

[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.380]
And now she's not allowed to dance.

[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.280]
They drove her away in an ambulance.

[00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:25.980]
Make it get commercial.

[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.180]
Make a bit fudge.

[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.400]
I fall in it.

[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.440]
And I can't get up.

[00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:32.320]
I fall in it.

[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:33.520]
And I can't get up.

[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.260]
Calm down, Randy.

[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.240]
1151 at WIOD.

[00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.420]
Cheryl was nice enough to bring me George's lighter,

[00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:42.440]
which you'll never get back.

[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:43.580]
That's it.

[00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:44.940]
And I take him home.

[00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:45.580]
Miami.

[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:46.840]
Hey, big boy.

[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.400]
How about a big Halloweeny?

[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.040]
OK, we got one for you here.

[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:51.360]
Let's go to Miami.

[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:51.760]
Hello.

[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:52.280]
Neil.

[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:52.880]
Yes, sir.

[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:53.520]
First time calling.

[00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:53.960]
Great.

[00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.880]
I was like the many unfortunate souls

[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.640]
to have to listen to Randy last night first.

[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.080]
Boy, see, I told you all these closet people are

[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.580]
swinging that door wide open and flying.

[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:03.800]
Oh, by the way, can I tell you this?

[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:04.900]
I'm going to close it about a rumor.

[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:08.160]
We just heard an incredible radio rumor.

[00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.480]
Sir, you'll be the first one to hear right to your ear.

[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:10.780]
OK.

[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:16.480]
This Friday, the massive changes at WS News, the talk disappears

[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.060]
and the music starts alleged.

[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:19.240]
That's the rumor.

[00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:20.580]
That's the opposite.

[00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:21.200]
That's my radio.

[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:21.700]
Yeah.

[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.660]
Anyway, I think that's what I'll tell

[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.280]
and Montevati in stereo.

[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:27.440]
Uh-oh.

[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:28.480]
Doing it together.

[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.420]
The I listened to her last night.

[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:34.560]
I'm not sure, but I think this was the topic of that evening.

[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.940]
And the market's up four points.

[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.000]
It was exciting.

[00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:40.460]
Which superhero could have sex in which couldn't?

[00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:41.560]
Oh, yeah.

[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.040]
I think that was her top top discussion.

[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.120]
Rubberman was pretty good.

[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:44.900]
Plastic man.

[00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:47.240]
I think she went and should have been rubberman.

[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:48.060]
It would have been a lot easier.

[00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:50.520]
I think she found interest in the four superheroes,

[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.060]
the one that was on fire all the time.

[00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:54.680]
She said something like she would like to get a hold of him,

[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.000]
but I wasn't sure that she'd

[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:56.940]
like to get a hold of anything.

[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.960]
Uh, the same person.

[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:01.320]
When I see you attacked one of the fire hydrants up on 79th

[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.420]
on the way to work, you have to be able to embarrass him.

[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.000]
I've never been to a King's game.

[00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:08.820]
Any way we can get those tickets on this way, please.

[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:09.200]
No.

[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:10.440]
Good try.

[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:10.860]
Bye-bye.

[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.080]
See, if you ask for the tickets,

[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.860]
that's a guarantee I hang up on you immediately,

[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:16.880]
because you should know that we don't do that.

[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:19.980]
The way we do the tickets is we get all the lines filled,

[00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:21.320]
which works every time.

[00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.940]
And then when I'm ready to do, I'll get out my little bag.

[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.380]
Let's see if we got my sack in here just a second.

[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:31.640]
Oh, yeah, we get out our real classy paper bag.

[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.580]
It's got our little eight numbered slips in it.

[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:35.320]
We pull out a number and it was ever on that line.

[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:38.400]
It gets the tickets for the Hurricane Panther game.

[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:40.200]
Now, we'll say this when we give the dolphin tickets

[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.160]
there's a little more hysteria on the line.

[00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.160]
George is busy touching around,

[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:46.100]
so he's not answering this line whoever it is.

[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:46.460]
Are you there?

[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:47.440]
Yes, I am.

[00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:48.400]
Do I want to hold?

[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:48.780]
Yes.

[00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:49.320]
Yes?

[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:50.380]
Be sure.

[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:51.200]
OK.

[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:53.620]
Let's go to a plantation.

[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:54.440]
Yes.

[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:55.040]
Here.

[00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:55.500]
Yeah.

[00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:59.120]
Who the hell are you that keeps destroying people's lives

[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.240]
like they're in here?

[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:00.700]
Where is it?

[00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:01.700]
Where is it?

[00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:03.320]
Who the hell are you?

[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.740]
Sir, Sirius wrote.

[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:05.860]
That's right.

[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.140]
Alex is no good.

[00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:09.240]
Andy's no good.

[00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:10.180]
Alex is no good.

[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:11.440]
The fat lady's no good.

[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.400]
Andy's any good.

[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:13.020]
You know what?

[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.840]
No one's any good but you.

[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:15.440]
You're good.

[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:17.480]
For something.

[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:19.540]
It's 1154.

[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:20.660]
It's 2.

[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:21.720]
Open lines and brown.

[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:22.280]
Look at that.

[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.720]
How much is give those tickets away now?

[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.760]
If there's nobody on 4 and 6, we'll just give them away

[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:26.760]
to 4 and 6.

[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.000]
It's for free.

[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:28.540]
We like it.

[00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:29.920]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:31.260]
OK.

[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.560]
Guess what number it is though?

[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.000]
It's number one.

[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:36.660]
Hello?

[00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:37.360]
Hello?

[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:38.100]
Yes.

[00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.000]
I like to speak to Neil.

[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:41.180]
OK.

[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:41.860]
Hold on everybody.

[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:43.460]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:45.180]
Speaking.

[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.260]
Hello, Neil.

[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:48.320]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.200]
Let me say it again.

[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:52.620]
Hello?

[00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:54.600]
Hello?

[00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:55.740]
Yes.

[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.300]
I want to speak to Neil.

[00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:57.820]
OK.

[00:20:58.940 --> 00:20:59.400]
Hello?

[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:00.320]
Yes.

[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:03.060]
You speak to somebody else?

[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.580]
I'm speaking to you, ma'am.

[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:06.120]
Right now.

[00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:07.040]
Is this Neil?

[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:08.000]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:08.900]
Oh, no, Neil.

[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:09.700]
How are you?

[00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:10.980]
I'm fine.

[00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:13.160]
You know, this is the first time I'm calling you.

[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:14.800]
I've been listening to you right along.

[00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:15.660]
Great.

[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:17.980]
What a great day, huh?

[00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.460]
Markets up almost five points.

[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:21.580]
What more could we want?

[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:21.920]
Yes.

[00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:23.520]
How are you?

[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:24.620]
Just terrific.

[00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:25.300]
How are you?

[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:26.400]
I'm fine.

[00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:27.040]
Thank you.

[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:28.120]
How you doing?

[00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:31.020]
Well, little idling around.

[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:33.280]
Yeah, little idling like my car.

[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:34.260]
And they can come on out.

[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.760]
How come a Spencer never brought my car keys back, did he?

[00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:38.780]
They can come on out.

[00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:39.020]
They can come on out.

[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:40.120]
Vanjula?

[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:41.700]
Yeah.

[00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:43.100]
You got a Jewish periket, huh?

[00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:44.280]
Yes, a Jewish car.

[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:45.400]
Does he eat halava?

[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.140]
OK, he eats everything.

[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.120]
Yeah, I know somebody like that.

[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:49.460]
Yeah.

[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.640]
Listen, you have a free date in your place.

[00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:54.000]
When you eat for nothing.

[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.240]
Yeah, isn't that great?

[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.000]
That's great.

[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.740]
We need to feed you a bengal over here.

[00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.180]
We got something from the...what is it?

[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.120]
Where are you at?

[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:00.740]
Located.

[00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:04.540]
We're on the 79th Street Causeway, right over from Miami Beach.

[00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.560]
Oh, right on the causeway.

[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:07.540]
Yeah, on the causeway.

[00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:10.140]
I'll be coming and see you at...

[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.380]
I like a...

[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:13.940]
Free food?

[00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:15.140]
A eggplant?

[00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:15.940]
A eggplant.

[00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:17.520]
Oh, that's my favorite.

[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:18.280]
Oh, that's great.

[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.100]
Too bad it's all gone.

[00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:20.220]
We invite you to come by.

[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.300]
Oh, yes.

[00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.040]
Well, you have that every day?

[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.720]
No, when we feel like it.

[00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:26.520]
We kind of vary our thing, you know?

[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:27.100]
Uh-huh.

[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.420]
You're terrific, guys.

[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:29.220]
One day we eat eggplant.

[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:30.660]
The next day we eat something else.

[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:31.140]
I love you.

[00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:32.480]
Well, that's great.

[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.700]
I hope you and Benji have a wonderful life together.

[00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:35.540]
Oh, yeah.

[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.560]
That's the only one I have in my life.

[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:38.500]
Well, thank God.

[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.380]
Just like my dog.

[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:39.500]
I love you.

[00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:40.820]
Yeah, me and my dogs.

[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:41.600]
That's all I got.

[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.280]
I just go home and lock that door and I talk to those dogs.

[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.840]
You have a woman.

[00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:47.260]
Oh, I have a woman?

[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:48.740]
A woman, a wife?

[00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:49.480]
A wife?

[00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:50.060]
Yeah.

[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:51.280]
Boy, that would be shocking.

[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.100]
Those wouldn't it.

[00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:53.920]
Why, you don't care for any wife.

[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.660]
I don't care for any wife or even a husband.

[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:57.900]
You have a girlfriend.

[00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:58.960]
Lots of them.

[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.220]
Well, I need a nice boy.

[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.520]
Tom and Jerry and Joe.

[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:03.380]
What is it?

[00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:06.420]
I can find a nice boyfriend like you.

[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.180]
A nice boyfriend like me, yeah.

[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:08.500]
Yeah.

[00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:09.920]
How to find.

[00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:11.060]
Yeah, they sure are.

[00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:11.860]
Tell me about it.

[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:12.320]
Yeah.

[00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:13.020]
You know what they say?

[00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:14.160]
A good man is hard to find.

[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.880]
A hard man is even good or to find.

[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:19.580]
Well, listen, you have a great day and you have been here.

[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:20.900]
You have good kids on the beak for me.

[00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:22.480]
I'll be going down to Subbie Nice.

[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:23.240]
Yeah.

[00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.240]
I'm bringing that bench over down.

[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:25.900]
Okay.

[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:27.340]
Well, we'll be looking for you.

[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:27.920]
You in the bird.

[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:28.460]
Yeah.

[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:29.100]
Okay.

[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:30.780]
Have a great day.

[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:32.700]
Wow.

[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:35.620]
1213 at W.I.D.

[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.320]
So those of you who wanted the tickets, guess what?

[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:37.820]
You lucked out.

[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:39.300]
I'm going to put that right back in the sack.

[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.640]
That number and shake them up again.

[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:42.600]
But she was a very nice lady.

[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:43.660]
She don't want no tickets.

[00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:46.160]
She just wanted to talk about Benji and have a nice time.

[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:46.880]
And she was great.

[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:50.080]
So after the break, we'll do the thing with the tickets again.

[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.900]
I told you we could milk this for about another hour.

[00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:52.700]
Trust me.

[00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:54.740]
Right?

[00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:55.980]
You bet.

[00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:59.180]
1226 at W.I.D.

[00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:01.460]
As far as that old fart that called about Randy Martin

[00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:03.480]
and about my destroying her life, isn't it interesting?

[00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:05.760]
She came in here like a vulture, like a barracuda

[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.140]
after Stan Major's job, right?

[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:09.680]
Is Stan here anymore?

[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:11.960]
I don't hear this guy fetching about poor Stan

[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.020]
who's got a family to raise and feed over there in plantation

[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.800]
who's dying over there, dying on the vine,

[00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:20.780]
desperate for work, starving to death.

[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.980]
And here we got this barracuda with her hair up like a, you know,

[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:28.100]
in a thing, in a bun, in a bun on the run.

[00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:29.840]
And she's on there tonight.

[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:33.140]
You could put her talent in a thimble and have room for all of mosquitoes

[00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:34.720]
inside floor to left over, okay?

[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:36.520]
I don't hear it.

[00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:38.960]
I can't handle those people who come in here like vultures

[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.460]
and stand over your shoulder and wait to get somebody else's job.

[00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.040]
Oh, geez, I ain't healed her here.

[00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:43.760]
Excuse me, Rick.

[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:47.420]
Talk 27 at WIOD, Fort Lauderdale.

[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.500]
I just call it tell you I didn't listen to Randy last night.

[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.600]
Thank God, that's why you sound like you're in a good mood today.

[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:53.040]
Jesus.

[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.080]
Why do these people make these mistakes over and over again?

[00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:57.700]
They all had these radio accidents.

[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.040]
Everyone is, that's too much of bigger numbers than you.

[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.120]
Everyone who listens to you, call it listen to her.

[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:03.940]
Number two thirds.

[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:05.380]
Oh, that's good.

[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:06.600]
You've got a point six.

[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:07.440]
Point six?

[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:08.460]
Special.

[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:09.540]
So anyway.

[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:10.860]
So anyway.

[00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:12.420]
I don't want to take it to you there.

[00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:12.900]
Good.

[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.360]
So can I have?

[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:14.900]
No.

[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.080]
We just gave him away.

[00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:16.680]
So?

[00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:18.900]
We got something for you.

[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:20.120]
You know what it is?

[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:20.380]
Special.

[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:21.420]
Dial tone.

[00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:23.500]
1227 and...

[00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:24.720]
9 and WIOD.

[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:25.900]
Let's go to Coral Springs.

[00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:27.540]
Good afternoon, Mr. Skinny.

[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:28.020]
How you doing?

[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:28.600]
Okay.

[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.060]
Listen, I'm sharing the road today with a celebrity.

[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:31.940]
You're sharing?

[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:32.640]
I was sharing.

[00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:33.220]

[00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:33.220]

[00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:38.400]
I was driving down to Turnpike at the Joe Robbie Stadium.

[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.440]
Coming up to the toilet.

[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.820]
How long you been talking like this?

[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:41.380]
What's that?

[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:42.900]
You've seen Jackie Mason lately?

[00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:44.200]
Why you're talking like this?

[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.280]
Oh, I don't know.

[00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:45.880]
Okay.

[00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:47.940]
I rolled up next to you in Pluto Horn,

[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.520]
but you made sure you looked straight ahead.

[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:50.100]
Oh, yeah.

[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:50.960]
Yes, I...

[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:51.920]
Why waved to you, sir?

[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:52.560]
Oh, you did?

[00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:53.900]
Yeah, I said you're number one.

[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.300]
I was in that yellow...

[00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:56.060]
Yellow...

[00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:56.380]
B there.

[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:57.060]
The one?

[00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:57.880]
Yellow cab.

[00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:00.540]
St. Career, the desert.

[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.340]
Don't give out that.

[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:04.880]
I thought that was pretty good time in the audience.

[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.120]
I saw you at the Joe Robbie Stadium.

[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.080]
And at the pole booth.

[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.160]
How old the same time?

[00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:09.140]
People are starting to talk.

[00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:10.240]
I thought that was incredible.

[00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:10.880]
It was great.

[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:11.900]
Have a good one, Dale.

[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:12.640]
I'm the same to you.

[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:13.480]
Oh, man.

[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:14.680]
It's almost empty.

[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:15.580]
The door.

[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:18.660]
And from where I sit, you can look out in a hallway where the mailboxes are.

[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:22.940]
And Mr. Executive is out there with his suspenders.

[00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:25.820]
Oh, geez.

[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:28.520]
Marvin with suspenders.

[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:32.000]
Man, you talk about a complete sellout.

[00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:33.200]
This guy...

[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.020]
He used to be just like a regular one of the guys.

[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:36.560]
Okay, he used to come in late every day.

[00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:38.040]
He used to be just a general pin in the ass.

[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.220]
He had no attention to anything.

[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:43.180]
Now he's a superstar with suspenders.

[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:45.960]
Hey, Marvin.

[00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:47.040]
I want to tell you something.

[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:49.040]
Only assholes wear suspenders.

[00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:49.560]
Okay?

[00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:53.460]
And if you don't believe me, go into our programming office right now.

[00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:55.080]
Take a look at our illustrious PD.

[00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:57.520]
Suspenders.

[00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:59.700]
Man, they went out with high-button shoes.

[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:01.960]
Are you kidding me?

[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:02.880]
Unbelievable.

[00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:06.880]
He's in there dressed up like Lord Foughtler, right?

[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.740]
Would suspenders like Mr. Executive?

[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:10.500]
Forget one, yeah.

[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:11.460]
If I should, we bet.

[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:15.260]
Why should anybody spend millions and millions and millions of dollars to build a new stadium?

[00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:19.020]
Well, we already have one in a great location when they put in the retractable seats.

[00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:20.120]
It's going to be tremendous.

[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.160]
Okay, granted.

[00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:21.820]
That's a point.

[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.160]
However, Neil, have you ever sat in the Joe Robbie's bands?

[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:30.060]
Not in the air-conditioned press box on your ass?

[00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:31.420]
Yes, I have.

[00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:33.300]
I sat in the first game.

[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:36.000]
You know how unbearingly hot it is there?

[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.480]
Well, let me ask you this, my psychotic friend.

[00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.600]
Baseball, what if they played almost all night games?

[00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:42.000]
Oh, is that right?

[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.460]
Yeah, that's what a lot of teams do.

[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:44.900]
They play night games like in Texas.

[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:49.500]
Play night games on Lake LaSerne and bike crack rocks on the way out of the stadium?

[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.600]
Oh, you know, it was really rough getting out there.

[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:56.180]
Thursday night, I thought it was going to have to be moded by 40 crack dealers stopping the car.

[00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:58.640]
Sir, you're just a negative jerk.

[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.640]
And here's this one for life, W-L-Y-Death.

[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:12.380]
Man, you're a part of the select segment of the South Florida population that's been chosen to participate in a research project on radio leasinging.

[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:18.120]
Your opinion is important and will help shape the type of programming that's offered to the South Florida radio audience.

[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:21.940]
Your assigned station is W-L-Y-F at 101.5.

[00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:25.680]
Please listen for at least an hour and then complete the opinion card.

[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:30.080]
If you can't listen at least in this week, be sure to note the week you were able to lease in.

[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.060]
Oh, man, who the hell are they killing?

[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:34.700]
What a bunch of crap, okay?

[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:37.380]
152 at W-L-Y-O-D.

[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:38.640]
I understand also the coast.

[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:40.640]
They spent millions and billions of dollars.

[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:50.820]
They sent this expensive mail-around three colors with all this crap about what do you like and what are your three-fraver records and this Johnny Darker Slob and all this other crap.

[00:28:50.820 --> 00:29:00.940]
And they got the TV spot that's on in the Joe Robbie Stadium eight million times a game and it's on during the news at least 400 times the newscast every year station may have spent billions of dollars.

[00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:03.540]
It's unbelievable.

[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:08.580]
What do we get over here? We get a billboard with 16 ugly teeth like chicklets. That's what we get.

[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:10.720]
And we're still kicking ass.

[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:11.640]
Mobile.

[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.480]
Hey, my green girlfriend. How are you, man?

[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.020]
Oh, my God.

[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.140]
Remember me?

[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:18.100]
How are you doing, Desi?

[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.480]
Good. What's happening?

[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:20.580]
We're doing it.

[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:25.520]
You know, my name is Faddle right here and it looks like a Joe Corroyo.

[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:37.860]
Corroyo is having a meeting with the sheriff Navarro because the sheriff he carried a little boys and girls here in Broward and then he got rid of all the rappers.

[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.660]
Now he wants to carry a little boy to the community.

[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.220]
So he's asking for Joe Corroyo.

[00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.480]
What? Are you nobody told him?

[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.140]
He's those coffee animals.

[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:48.740]
Yeah.

[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:49.500]
Those coffee?

[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.660]
Okay, you break it up, palsy.

[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:52.980]
Audio is sastiluago.

[00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:54.940]
Astamanyana.

[00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:55.940]
Oh, look at that.

[00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:56.840]
Look at this.

[00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:57.980]
Woo!

[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.300]
Suspenders at all with a tie.

[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.220]
With his came art suit.

[00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:07.460]
Unbelievable.

[00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:10.120]
He went shopping with Wayne Arnold for clothes today.

[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:13.180]
Oh, God.

[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:21.020]
So when a guy with a suit and suspenders comes up to you and wants to stick 14 watermelons in your pants, you'll know who it is.

[00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:22.860]
Unreal. I can't believe this guy.

[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:25.860]
He's consorting with the management now.

[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:27.020]
Now he wants to be one of those.

[00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:28.740]
He's been an underling long amount.

[00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:31.360]
Now he wants to be one of those management types.

[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.820]
He wants to be Mr. Hachach.

[00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:35.480]
I pretty soon will have his own orifice.

[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:37.280]
Miami.

[00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:42.580]
If I had this ability, I'd kick your ass down your throat and sell your teeth.

[00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:43.340]
Okay.

[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:45.640]
Here's a mobile on the Starline.

[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:46.320]
How you doing?

[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:46.920]
Great.

[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:52.060]
Listen, there's a bunch of cops on motorcycle on 595.

[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:57.140]
And I was just driving down 95 and this asshole coming off.

[00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:58.360]
Can you play him something?

[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:00.020]
What?

[00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:01.480]
Can you play him something?

[00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.240]
You have, we had time when we'd play him something, okay?

[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:06.780]
Have a great life.

[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:08.880]
We don't have time to play that now.

[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:09.360]
Okay, sir.

[00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:10.460]
The show is almost over.
