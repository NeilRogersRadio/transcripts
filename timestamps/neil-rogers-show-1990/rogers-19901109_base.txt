[00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.320]
Well, I drive up to Tonsamay, do truck in coast to coast.

[00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.760]
I like my rig, I like the rule, but it's not what I love most.

[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.360]
There's a gal I'll left in Fresco, a sweet young fine name rose,

[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.020]
and the best dang fine about her. She lets me wear her clothes.

[00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.000]
Well, I'm proud to be country transvestite.

[00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.840]
And I love to wear the girls clothes all day.

[00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.000]
Home day!

[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.340]
Lazy bra, a frilly blast, a silky negligent.

[00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.860]
Now I'm still a macho tough guy in a hoop you'll understand.

[00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.660]
I was born with a big black mustache and a six back in my hand.

[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.220]
But when I go out for more, I do it well for twins.

[00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.800]
All worse, strapless evening gown and a nose gay on my wrist.

[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.220]
Yes, I'm proud to be country transvestite.

[00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.320]
And I love to wear the girls clothes all day.

[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.100]
Home day!

[00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.760]
I close my lips, tease my heart and sleep and lost a ring.

[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.320]
Now I like the way I'm living. Don't just be by my clothes.

[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.780]
I'm an old American, he man, I love legs, can he hold?

[00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.380]
So don't look at me funny or I'll punch out your lines.

[00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.180]
And the last thing you'll remember is a trucker in fishnet tides.

[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.700]
Just I'm proud to be country transvestite.

[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.800]
Travestite!

[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.800]
And I love to wear the girls clothes all day.

[00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.000]
Home day!

[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.580]
Painted lips, padded hips, my shaved legs on display.

[00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.260]
Yes, I'm proud to be country transvestite.

[00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.800]
And I love to wear the girls clothes all day.

[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.380]
Stouled in muse, something views, well it sends us all my way.

[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.120]
Yes, I'm proud to be country transvestite.

[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.440]
I guess these panties hold on here.

[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.780]
Hope I don't get a run.

[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.940]
You know I hate that, I hate that.

[00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.540]
You know when you chip your nail, nothing's like so far just terrible.

[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.900]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.900]
I could use a bubble bath, I really could.

[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.300]
And I'm going to go to the shop, I am.

[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.880]
I wasn't starting to play that because I see Randy as playing a thing tonight.

[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.660]
Country music, why do they have such fanatical fans?

[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.100]
She asks, I'm sure you're very concerned about that.

[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.640]
Guests include the program director of Kiss Radio.

[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.880]
As in Kiss this, the Nashville network and interviews with Marie and the

[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.300]
Osmond Larry Gatlin and Genie C. Raleigh and many more.

[00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.560]
Ooh boy, maybe Randy's going back to Kiss.

[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.640]
Music.

[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.880]
Music.

[00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.960]
Music.

[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.600]
Music.

[00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.820]
Oh, oh, wait a minute, how are you going to let it go?

[00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.800]
Finally, the baby has returned to the dance floor.

[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.040]
Oh, I don't care what my father says, I want you to hold me.

[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.680]
But now she's got a brand new partner.

[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.880]
Be quiet, jealousy, I'm trying to use the phone.

[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:16.160]
Yes, it's Jennifer Gray and Pee Wee Herman together again for the first time in nerdy dancing.

[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.660]
Hey Jennifer, what?

[00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.580]
How about my big shoes on?

[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.740]
I know, oh, you stepped on my budget, jerk.

[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.340]
I know you are, but what am I?

[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.580]
Pee Wee, you always got to be so obnoxious?

[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.980]
Oh, not just that's the word of a dance.

[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.460]
No longer in a movie.

[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.380]
It's an excuse to release another soundtrack album.

[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.800]
That's so funny, I forgot the last nerdy dancing.

[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.500]
Now, showing it a playhouse near you will write.

[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:53.960]
T. Races in different, marijuana, deliciously different, marijuana.

[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.400]
Okay, that's a good point.

[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.140]
Come, drop them down the street.

[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.680]
We gotta use these walkers, cos we gotta be old bad people.

[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:14.600]
Hey, hey, we've got old monkeys, the children don't run us all over.

[00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.740]
They say we smell candy funky, and they're all stupid and grown.

[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.600]
Pee Wee, make money from rarans, on that kebukhavi.

[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:36.040]
But I just wanna stay home, fix a nice dresser thing with no women.

[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:41.500]
Hey, how you were old monkeys, and here all who's in our hair.

[00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.800]
This week we're on that TV, next week on Medicare.

[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.740]
Yeah, then right now, you're in Buddhism's home.

[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.780]
It's the mug, day morning meal, rudges show.

[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.360]
I'm see the floor.

[00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:02.360]
Okay, that's great.

[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.440]
1118 at WID, you know you're still there?

[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.040]
Yeah.

[00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.700]
What happened?

[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.920]
I don't know, you thought I was West Palm or something.

[00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:08.960]
Well, where are you?

[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.680]
Boca, I said.

[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.360]
Boca, a roton.

[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.240]
Mod's close enough.

[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.240]
Yeah, what ever happened to Stan Major?

[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.920]
Whatever happened to him, he's alive and well in plantation, and life goes on.

[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.200]
Is he working at a station?

[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.160]
For Mike Wayman, I got a signed little autograph here when you're a big star, when you weigh 450 pounds.

[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.820]
I heard that last night.

[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.100]
The only station you'll see Stan had is probably Amico over there in Brord Boulevard.

[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.380]
But he's doing okay.

[00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.980]
I heard you were mentioned on Larry King.

[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:35.800]
Yeah, you didn't hear the tape?

[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.480]
No, I heard it like around 450.

[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:39.720]
But will we have it on tape?

[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:40.340]
Do you wanna hear it?

[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.880]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.060]
Now, will you hold on?

[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:43.320]
Yes.

[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.500]
Then you'd come back and come, and I'll put you on hold again.

[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.680]
You're probably used to it by now.

[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.020]
Hold on a second.

[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:50.660]
Ashford and Simpson off.

[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.340]
That's not the right time.

[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.380]
Well, I've done that twice today.

[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.140]
That's three mistakes.

[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.860]
That's for that old bitch that called before.

[00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.060]
Have a great life, Mike, and book up a little.

[00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:57.760]
New Rogers.

[00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.280]
Oh, he must be jealous.

[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:00.780]
He's jealous, isn't he?

[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.520]
I guess.

[00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:02.720]
You know what they did today?

[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.400]
They said anybody here in Miami who's owed money by Larry King turning their headlights on.

[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.640]
I'll tell you what, I look like the full dam tower was going to the funeral.

[00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.680]
I feel sorry for Neil.

[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:14.820]
Oh, yeah?

[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.360]
Yeah, well, if you knew the whole story, he said.

[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:22.300]
But yeah, he doesn't make a lot of money, and he's been in that market a long time,

[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.380]
and he really would rather probably, he'd rather ride on his horses.

[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.660]
So he gets kind of sad, but he's been jealous the long time.

[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.640]
I haven't seen him in, uh...

[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.760]
What is this, 1990?

[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:40.120]
The last time I saw him was in 19...

[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:43.320]
77.

[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:52.040]
I only raised it back in 1977, and then he called me the day the near admittedly was a homosexual.

[00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:59.460]
Uh, on the air he called me to thank me because I had had Sergeant Maclubick on the air the night before,

[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.400]
and he had heard Sergeant Maclubick.

[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.120]
His name is Matlovitch.

[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:03.520]
Matlovitch Larry.

[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.800]
Since passed on with AIDS.

[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:10.380]
Encourage people who were homosexuals to come out of the closet, and Neil had heard the show,

[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:15.980]
and came out of the closet the next day on his own radio show, and then called me to thank me for having Maclubick on.

[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.460]
And so, last time I've ever seen him, I was told him to.

[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:26.480]
And then I've heard some people like yourself saying he does this, but I feel very sorry for people who are kind of caught in that local web of jealousy.

[00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:27.880]
Oh, I know, sad.

[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.680]
And I heard he weighed like 400 pounds, but I haven't seen him.

[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.240]
You know, the last time I saw him, I'd say weighed 350.

[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.120]
Okay, that's it.

[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.820]
Now, are you a homosexual now?

[00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:39.500]
Uh, today.

[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.280]
Oh, this is Mr. Radio?

[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.140]
Oh, my God.

[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:46.800]
We went to, you know, wondering hung on so long.

[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:47.920]
That's Mr. Radio.

[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:53.620]
21 after 11 at WLD, and we have an open-line in Broward, 5249463.

[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.940]
Maybe pansy would be, I'd live up to that.

[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.120]
We have an open-line in Palm Beach, 655.

[00:08:58.740 --> 00:08:59.900]
I can't believe it.

[00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.940]
Now, listen, you always call from Daytona. He wasn't called from Maboka.

[00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.160]
He called from Daytona Beach and lied about it.

[00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:07.800]
You make a sick Mr. Radio, okay?

[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.760]
6, 10, 10, 15, 16.

[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.500]
Watch the matter, dear.

[00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:15.280]
Oh, Grandpa.

[00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.480]
Man can be such a...

[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.020]
Oh, here, honey.

[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.820]
Why don't you try some of this nice hot Luther Campbell soup?

[00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:24.460]
Luther Campbell soup?

[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.000]
But Grandpa, we just had two lives, too last night.

[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.220]
I know, but this is all a different, that's all.

[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.000]
It's got the whole alphabet in it, see the little letters.

[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:34.820]
Hey, you're right.

[00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:39.020]
Look, there's a bath and a you...

[00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:40.380]
Yeah, you just try it, honey.

[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:45.180]
No, it's completely tasteless. Why would anyone eat this?

[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.560]
Why? You know, me so hungry, that's why.

[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.040]
Luther Campbell's funky soups.

[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.620]
Holy Cooked taste so funky.

[00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.640]
You'll be tempted to eat it with a poop.

[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.500]
No, what was that you said in the home?

[00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:57.420]
I said, fuck.

[00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.300]
Oh, yeah.

[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.780]
Ooh, bad, bad,

[00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.360]
Luther Campbell's the dog.

[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.580]
A word.

[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.780]
Okay, 1126.

[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.460]
Wow, we're doing it, you know what?

[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.980]
Let's just put that on Endos loop and go home.

[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:17.840]
Let's try Tamarack.

[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:18.480]
Neil.

[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:19.300]
Yes, sir.

[00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:23.360]
I was at Pompo last night making my weekly donation.

[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.060]
Yeah.

[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.620]
And I ended up with a spy report.

[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:31.240]
I think week is my word at Pompo, no, this year, that's W-E-A-K, I've been real week.

[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:33.320]
I haven't even come close this year.

[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.160]
No, I just don't know the screen reader banana.

[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.200]
Do you remember Hinsdale Raceway?

[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.480]
I've never been there, but a new hamstring, man.

[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.640]
Yeah, rocking ham.

[00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:43.200]
I've been there many, many a time.

[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.680]
There's Pugboy and Bucky Day.

[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:45.980]
Bucky Day, that's right.

[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.420]
In a desperate drive, Bobby Huntress.

[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.400]
Do you remember General Washington?

[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.520]
There's Beckwith, what was his name?

[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:52.860]
What?

[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:53.760]
No, Beckwith.

[00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.100]
There was Ted Wing.

[00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:57.780]
Ted Wing, Alex Winger.

[00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.320]
Uh, where we go?

[00:10:59.420 --> 00:10:59.580]
Vincent?

[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.780]
Do you know how much the audience hates this when we do it?

[00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:02.740]
That's why I like to do it.

[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:03.980]
How about Steve Warrington?

[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.380]
Called, Steve Warrington's good.

[00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.020]
He's that whole Warrington family man.

[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.320]
They can drive a horse about...

[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:08.620]
How about...

[00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:09.460]
You know what Larry King said?

[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.100]
I'd rather be riding a harness horse.

[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:12.740]
That's what Larry said.

[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.600]
How about Green Mountain Raceway?

[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.400]
In Vermont.

[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:17.840]
Longsons closed, innit?

[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:19.400]
Roarongson, Scalhegan.

[00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:20.240]
What?

[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.080]
Scalhegan, Downs and Main.

[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.220]
No, I'd never been to Main.

[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.700]
They got those great tracks like Cumberland and Scarborough.

[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:29.060]
Right, they do a 235 mile up there.

[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:29.480]
Yeah.

[00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:32.520]
The, uh, but I have a spire report for you.

[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.120]
Okay.

[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.060]
Allen Finkelson's son.

[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:35.720]
Mike.

[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.340]
Fell off of a golf cart.

[00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:39.040]
Yeah.

[00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:41.240]
While working in Valley parking.

[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.780]
Might knock some sense into him.

[00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.020]
No, it knocked money into his pocket.

[00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.320]
He's on work as compensation.

[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.140]
When was this?

[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.700]
Uh, it happened last week.

[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.240]
I saw him at the track left.

[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.020]
You saw him?

[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:52.640]
Yes.

[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:53.560]
Saw.

[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:54.160]
Yeah.

[00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.900]
And he was complaining about the fact that he can't go back to work in Valley parking.

[00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.040]
Mike's always complaining because he never, he hasn't cashed a ticket in 20 years.

[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.480]
No, he hasn't.

[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:04.980]
I can't find the Hank Goldberg cart.

[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.240]
Isn't that enough to really may have frost your ass a little bit?

[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:09.320]
How about...

[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.380]
How about Pine Hollow's Stoodfong?

[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:11.280]
Does that frost you?

[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:12.140]
Who?

[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.000]
Pine Hollow's Stoodfong.

[00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:14.620]
Don't know it.

[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.200]
Martin Feinder?

[00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:18.280]
Yeah.

[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.040]
Harold Dancer Jr.?

[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:20.260]
Yeah.

[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.380]
Dr. J?

[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.400]
Dr. J.

[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.940]
I just thought I'd sneak him in there.

[00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:28.740]
Okay.

[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:37.680]
I would like to take this opportunity to call two of my friends Oscar and Joey who will be playing rocket ball this afternoon.

[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:38.180]
Yeah.

[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:38.940]
Dooshbags.

[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:39.680]
Okay.

[00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.620]
And I look forward to seeing you at the track.

[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.460]
I'm coming up tonight at the end of the lunch.

[00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:43.760]
I'm coming up there tonight.

[00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:45.040]
I'm playing El Ambaro.

[00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.200]
Stay the hell away from me.

[00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:46.520]
Okay.

[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:47.160]
Go away.

[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:47.860]
But I go down here.

[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.320]
Thanks for your money for Camilla's house.

[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.240]
Now just stay away.

[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.540]
Don't come anywhere near me.

[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.100]
Just stay up there.

[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:58.560]
You're a little table and Shmoos with Alan, the assistant major, de up there and leave me alone.

[00:12:58.640 --> 00:12:59.500]
Hey, I got a great idea.

[00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:01.460]
He's like a kisser that all I got to do is see him.

[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.160]
And immediately I just can't pick my nose.

[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:08.060]
Why don't you have a race up there for Camilla's house dinner?

[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:09.700]
Well, I'm going to talk to Alan tonight.

[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.040]
A Finkelson tonight is about doing something for Camilla's house.

[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:12.560]
You're all well.

[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:15.000]
We'll make donations and go up there and get a night of racing.

[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:15.860]
I got news for it.

[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:19.080]
They could build their whole new building with the I've left it pompin' already this season.

[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.740]
Don't leave me left it pompin' though.

[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:21.060]
You bet.

[00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:22.220]
What about wheeling down?

[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:23.280]
Good luck.

[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:23.860]
Goodbye.

[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:24.320]
See ya.

[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.180]
Another Hylia call?

[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.120]
Hello there.

[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:27.840]
Yes, sir.

[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.460]
Five hours of sports talk.

[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.140]
All right.

[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:31.760]
Here we go.

[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.380]
In other words, you haven't even heard what Hanks's going to do yet.

[00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:35.800]
You're already passing judgment.

[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.860]
Which is right next to passing gas.

[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.340]
Is he going to stay on sports talk now or is he just...

[00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:40.540]
No.

[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:43.000]
Well, I find his own show he never appears there anymore.

[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.880]
Well, I wouldn't say he'd never appear there, but he's not going to be on that show.

[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:46.660]
Okay.

[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:47.780]
He's got his own thing.

[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.300]
They got their thing and he's got his thing and ever the twain she'll meet.

[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.120]
You're going to make him promise not to talk sports.

[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:57.180]
No, he's going to talk some sports, but he's a well-rounded guy.

[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.420]
And if you've seen him lately, you know what I'm talking about.

[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.040]
Very around.

[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:01.120]
Now, Hanks a fun guy.

[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.620]
He'll develop a thing.

[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.000]
Oh, speaking of Steve, you'll never guess who's new best.

[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:08.280]
Well, let me ask you this question before.

[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.660]
I don't want to try to sway you, but who'd you rather hear from me to 11?

[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.000]
Randy Martin or Hank Goldberg?

[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:14.280]
Stan Major.

[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:14.700]
Okay.

[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:15.520]
Okay.

[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:17.160]
Now, what is it about the thief?

[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.000]
His new best buddy in the world.

[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:20.300]
Besides Rick Siderman?

[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.460]
Alex Bennett.

[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:22.380]
Yeah.

[00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:26.820]
Yeah, they met up there and while they share this one contempt, you know,

[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.200]
anybody who's hostile toward me is Steve's best buddy.

[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.300]
That's his whole thing in life.

[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.660]
Rick Siderman and Bob Kunst and Ellis Ruben.

[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:36.600]
That's the only guy that he knows that I like and it likes me as Norm Kent.

[00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:41.420]
And that's his new motivation for why he's out to get Rick Riley.

[00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:42.780]
Oh, yeah.

[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:43.660]
He's just a...

[00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:44.380]
You know, I'll be honest.

[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.180]
I punch him up at all yesterday.

[00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:48.880]
I think for about 30 seconds on a way home.

[00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.320]
And what was he doing yesterday?

[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:52.960]
Open phone.

[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:55.920]
I don't remember what it was, but whatever it was, it was so terminal.

[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:56.940]
And I just punched it out.

[00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:00.200]
I told you the novelty wears off very fast, okay?

[00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:04.620]
Now, now he's grasping at the fact that Rick Riley stole Alex Bennett's job.

[00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:05.120]
Yeah.

[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:05.820]
Oh, yeah.

[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:10.240]
Well, he stole somebody's job over there at FTL.

[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.480]
He brought in, in fact, he did it in the most devious way of all.

[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.000]
He brought in his own sponsors and he blew somebody out.

[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.940]
Whoever was doing midday because they moved Mike Roberts up to 10 to 2.

[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.020]
So somebody got blown out to make room for him.

[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.420]
But he's still making 250 value a year.

[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:22.980]
At least.

[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.640]
Maybe half a million.

[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:25.440]
That's what he said.

[00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:27.180]
I said, how's it doing working on commission?

[00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:29.740]
Hey, you said...

[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.820]
Let's say you make 250,000 a year.

[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:32.660]
Oh, God.

[00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.800]
Well, you can't teach an old dog new tricks, sir.

[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:36.500]
That's true.

[00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:37.440]
Have a great life.

[00:15:51.960 --> 00:16:02.120]
I'm going to give you a little bit of bread load.

[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:02.740]
11.47.

[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:30.240]
I'm going to give you a little bit of bread.

[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:30.260]

[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:30.260]

[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:30.260]

[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:30.260]

[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:30.260]

[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:30.260]

[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:30.260]

[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:30.260]

[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:30.260]

[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:30.480]
I'm going to give you a little bit of bread.

[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:30.620]
I'm going to give you a little bit of bread.

[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:31.380]
I'm going to give you a little bit of bread.

[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:31.740]
I'm going to give you a little bit of bread.

[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:32.720]
I'm going to give you a little bit of bread.

[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.440]
No, not yet.

[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.040]
I won't enjoy it supporting those.

[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.800]
Well, actually, any of Steve's sponsor's actually.

[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:44.660]
And then I was listening to Rick and Sides and he had a guy talking about pirated music

[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:46.080]
and Evan called.

[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:47.680]
Who did?

[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:48.680]
Evan, one of their...

[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:49.160]
Oh, Evan.

[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.820]
I got to apologize to Evan.

[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:52.880]
He was over at the remote at specs on Wednesday.

[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:53.980]
And I didn't recognize him.

[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.920]
He's got this funky little go-tee now and he looks so bizarre.

[00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:58.260]
Well, he had...

[00:16:58.260 --> 00:16:58.900]
What's up, Evan?

[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.480]
Yeah, he said he's an assistant manager at a record store.

[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.860]
And being in the industry, he knew quite a bit of what they were talking about.

[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:06.960]
By in paper the beer.

[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.880]
I'm glad you found that one, Neil.

[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:09.620]
Isn't that great?

[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:10.780]
I feel a lot better now.

[00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:15.180]
Well, and I, like you say, I don't think Hank is going to do five hours of sports.

[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:15.800]
No way.

[00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:16.360]
There's no way.

[00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:17.140]
I mean, he'll do...

[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:21.160]
He'll enter Spursala Sports just like I do an issue, but it's not a sports show.

[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:26.700]
Sure, he has to get all his food topics in and he's big with the women, too, so...

[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:27.000]
He'll...

[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:27.840]
That's what we hear.

[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:28.200]
Yeah.

[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:30.520]
I think it's only a rumor.

[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:32.020]
I think it's only a rumor.

[00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.100]
Well, you have a good day.

[00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.720]
Only his hairdresser knows for sure.

[00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:38.080]
That's true, and before I go, I'd like to call John and Jim Adouche back.

[00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:38.500]
Okay.

[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:39.080]
Thank you.

[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:39.440]
See?

[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:40.960]
It won't come any better than Angleberg.

[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:41.700]
Turned about.

[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.200]
Bad house, doubt.

[00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:45.440]
Listen.

[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:47.920]
Stand still.

[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:49.940]
All right.

[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:50.620]
Hello.

[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.060]
What earth's warm, huh?

[00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:53.000]
I'll say.

[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.680]
You come your often, pardon me?

[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:57.100]
Have you been here before?

[00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:57.800]
No.

[00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:58.840]
First time.

[00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:00.160]
What's your name?

[00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:00.860]
Three way.

[00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:01.720]
Three way.

[00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:02.560]
That's nice.

[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:03.760]
I'm a bigot.

[00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:04.720]
We have to meet you.

[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:05.380]
Bigot.

[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:06.120]
Right here.

[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.660]
You were here to get clean, you know what?

[00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:13.280]
Oh, I don't know.

[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.440]
You were work around here?

[00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:17.860]
I'm a waiter, but Ashley, I'm an actor, you know.

[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:18.920]
Yeah, you know, I know.

[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:19.720]
What could happen?

[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.020]
You probably need to rely on you.

[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:25.520]
Well, I'll say, but you know, with everything that's in the news and all, it's just...

[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:28.100]
Hey, you can start relaxing right now, freeway.

[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.280]
I brought something.

[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.340]
Ooh, she, hmm.

[00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:33.220]
And freeway.

[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.020]
Not just any sheep either.

[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:35.780]
Look.

[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.100]
Wow, gold lame.

[00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:40.740]
Pretty kicky condom, huh?

[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:45.040]
But here's the most important part, freeway, in the Pro-Teched Label.

[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.460]
Pro-Teched, huh?

[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:47.920]
Aren't those in Doran's?

[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.480]
By the City Council of San Francisco?

[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:50.280]
Absolutely.

[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.480]
You know the Pro-Teched slogan, don't you?

[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:54.240]
I sure do.

[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.760]
Certified, safe, by the city.

[00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:57.500]
By the bay.

[00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:59.240]
Well, what do you say?

[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.160]
Doran, look at that.

[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:02.720]
I dropped this soap again.

[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.360]
I'll get it.

[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.340]
You bet your life he will.

[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:07.820]
And with confidence.

[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:11.060]
Because freeway in Spiket have condoms.

[00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:15.420]
Don't let worry, spoil those chance meetings in public showers.

[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.240]
Always carry Pro-Teched.

[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:18.240]
Pro-Teched.

[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.020]
PROTC, ECT.

[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.120]
Keep my mind free, SMB.

[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:25.260]
PROTC, ECT.

[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.460]
Been down with no apology.

[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:29.460]
I can't do this, I can't do this.

[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:29.920]
I can't do this.

[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:31.020]
I can't do this.

[00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:31.340]
I can't do this.

[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.400]
Don't doubt.

[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:33.800]
Know what it's all about.

[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.340]
The Pro-Teched sheep.

[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:39.460]
So they won't send you a re-protect condoms.

[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.800]
I've division of Black Flag House in Garden, that's from Golden Division.

[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.980]
Keep the situation safe since 1887.

[00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:45.400]
Hollywood.

[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:46.840]
Hey, Neil, what's happening?

[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:47.360]
How you doing?

[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:47.640]
I'm fine.

[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:48.040]
All right.

[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:48.720]
I'm okay.

[00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:52.200]
I wish you had a birthday and happy anniversary, even though it is a little bit late.

[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.260]
Well, thanks a lot.

[00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:55.140]
Okay, listen, I got something for you to hear.

[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.260]
It's only about a minute long, can you hear it?

[00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:57.880]
Now, what is it?

[00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:58.500]
Give me a little hint.

[00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.880]
It's called the rubber song.

[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.280]
The rubber song?

[00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:02.160]
The rubber song.

[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.160]
Am I going to have to dump it?

[00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:04.320]
No, no, it's clean.

[00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:04.920]
Okay.

[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:05.740]
All right, hold on.

[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.500]
Sometimes I feel...

[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:10.900]
Here we go.

[00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:12.580]
Okay, we're ready for it.

[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:18.480]
Okay, it's 11-hp.

[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:23.720]
Wow.

[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:29.580]
I always liked those, especially when they're like real far away in that case, I think maybe a little farther would have been better.

[00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:29.880]
Hello.

[00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:31.800]
Yeah, I got a big report for you, Neil.

[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:32.240]

[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.400]
Going with North Miami Beach and Ernie Hickey's a douchebag.

[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:36.020]
All right.

[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.380]
Short and sweet, which we needed.

[00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:40.720]
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.560]
It's in, tough to play on, thing.

[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.880]
If I had the ability to do, I'd take you out here right now.

[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.240]
Tick your goddamn teeth in, San Francisco.

[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:49.740]
Good morning, Neil.

[00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:52.140]
Are you really in the city by the bay?

[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.220]
Yes, I am.

[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.060]
Come on, put you down a little.

[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:54.640]
Okay.

[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:59.380]
I woke up listening to Alex for maybe 20 minutes.

[00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:00.000]
Yeah.

[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.100]

[00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:06.380]

[00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:52.090]
bold on my brain

[00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:06.490]
you might be

[00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:08.670]
you might pose

[00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:09.930]
the world

[00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:11.430]
all is gone

[00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:15.010]
but go won't buy a happy

[00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:15.330]
and

[00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:17.510]
and growing

shine upon

[00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:35.010]
before we let that finish can i ask a simple question what the hell were they

[00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:38.070]
thinking about when they put that man on the air here what in god's name

[00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:38.950]
possessed them

[00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:40.510]
to put that

[00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:43.770]
slime on the air i just uh...

[00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:44.890]
when nobody

[00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:46.350]
is somebody

[00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:56.130]
Daniel

[00:24:58.190 --> 00:24:59.230]
Okay, I

[00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:04.570]
Turned out Steve Caves here. He sounded like yesterday and the first color guess who it was

[00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:06.250]
No, Gilbert

[00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:08.870]
In and Kelvin. Oh, no

[00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:13.690]
Yes, they're sucking up on thing how great they are how happy they are that he's back now

[00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:17.050]
I want to tell you something if I always told you about watch out for the chronics

[00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:20.290]
There a bunch of phony but suckers and they fly around like butterfly

[00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:24.470]
I create like a bumblebee they flip from one perch to another I hope that I'm

[00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:29.750]
Pollinating everywhere those two of the biggest phonies they were on with Rick and suds in the beginning doing their little

[00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:34.810]
Joint at the hip routine on the phone and sucking around with them and then they came over here and they ruined our Wednesday

[00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:40.630]
Lunches and now they're all of a sudden sucking around over there. Yeah, they were they were basher Rick and suds two things

[00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:43.190]
They called them Steve cane junior or whatever

[00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:45.250]
And I'm believable

[00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:52.970]
Oh, I guess you must have been the one

[00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:58.350]
Don't like Rick and suds you just give them positive things

[00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:02.670]
Well, you know, it's really interesting that he makes those things up because I have never I haven't spoken

[00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:07.450]
To Steve since they came here. I've the only time I've spoken over been right here on the air

[00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:12.910]
I've never said that it's totally untrue and it's another if he said that which all I have is your word

[00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:18.690]
It's another one of his lies just like just like the thing about the Disney telling us we can't put any callers on who mentioned his name

[00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:22.730]
Steve why do you make up so much BS? Let's let's send Steve a big shovel okay?

[00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:30.390]
Ask you and you were to answer honestly on scale of one to ten you being a ten how

[00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:34.570]
Rick and suds are doing and you were to be totally honest you would say no more than a one

[00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:38.070]
Oh, yeah, that's when they got a four seven in the last book

[00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:41.950]
What was Steve's last number here a three five with some very embarrassing demographics?

[00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:48.510]
I know Steve Keyes was thinking he is totally boring and that'll be the last time I ever listen to that now you'll turn it on again

[00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:53.350]
No, I swear I won't know Rick and suds are great. I agree with that okay, okay

[00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:58.810]
But just keep making it up Steve just keep desperately flailing around trying to cause that big controversy because

[00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:04.710]
It just ain't happening. I mean like I said I wish him all a luck in the world and I his his success or lack of it

[00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:07.330]
Is gonna have nothing to do with Rick and suds or this station?

[00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:11.650]
I mean the only thing the stations got to do with it is we've given a more promotion than over there

[00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:14.510]
Which is nothing because they haven't got two nickels to rub together at FTL

[00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:19.010]
But that's about it. So we certainly can't blame us for we've given him a big send-off

[00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:22.670]
But geez you got to make your own thing you got to do your own show

[00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:27.210]
You can't try to siphon off from the rest of the world forever. You have to stay at any your own two feet

[00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:28.130]
Be a man

[00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:32.610]
Like Marlon Brando said and we still want to know what the Helenos about it

With the Iraqi people

[00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:42.790]
Our quarrel is with Iraq's dictator and with his aggression

[00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:46.990]
Iraq will not be permitted to annex Kuwait

[00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:49.610]
Just the way it's going to be

[00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:08.350]
The way Kuwait and me

[00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:10.930]
The Iraqi people

[00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:12.550]
The Iraqi people

[00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:14.450]
Up to his head

[00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:17.310]
And blow away this key

[00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:19.410]
We want to be unplayed

[00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:20.110]
To fight

[00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:21.670]
And get down play

[00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:22.830]
And I'm gonna die

[00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:24.630]
And I'm gonna die

[00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:27.210]
And I'm gonna die

[00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:28.130]
And I'm gonna die

[00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:29.790]
And I'm gonna die

[00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:32.250]
And I'm gonna die

[00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:41.090]
And I'm gonna die

[00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:43.390]
And I'm gonna die

[00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:45.010]
And I'm gonna die

[00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:48.070]
And I'm gonna die

[00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.430]
And I'm gonna die

[00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:48.430]

[00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:57.110]
Well, I got a button for Larry

[00:31:57.910 --> 00:31:58.270]
A what?

[00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:00.290]
I got a button for Larry

[00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:04.950]
When your memory goes, you can forget it

[00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:05.490]
Great

[00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:09.330]
Listen, I knew him when he was in a showboat

[00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:12.810]
And front of the big hotel in Miami, beach

[00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:14.210]
But he was just a shlipper

[00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:17.750]
That's when he went in the back part right there

[00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:18.210]
Yeah

[00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:21.710]
Instead of playing the horses, he rode up

[00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:22.730]
Mm-hmm

[00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:26.070]
Boy, I tell you that was a good idea

[00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:28.910]
Wish it was down there to put my lights on yesterday

[00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:30.310]
I'm going to do it that

[00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:34.010]
Oh, now we're going to do it

[00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:35.190]
Yeah, good enough

[00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:36.390]
Have a great life

[00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:39.910]

Plantation

[00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:45.250]
Hi Neil

[00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:45.710]
Hi

[00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:47.670]
It was my anniversary of the day

[00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:49.090]
So I called Rick and Sud's show

[00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:49.590]
And they said

[00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:52.290]
I was trying to decide between the melting pot

[00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:53.490]
and the armadillo cafe

[00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:54.070]
Yeah

[00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:55.990]
Rick said go to the melting pot

[00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:57.830]
I think it's because he lives in Pearl Springs

[00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:58.270]
Mm-hmm

[00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:01.370]
And Sud says go to Armadillo

[00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:03.790]
And I heard Armadillo on your show

[00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:05.610]
So we decided to go to the Armadillo

[00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:06.830]
And it was outstanding

[00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:07.770]
It's outrageous

[00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:09.950]
Oh, it's great, it's orgasmic

[00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:11.510]
It was a good night

[00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:12.150]
What'd you have?

[00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:14.450]
I had the seafood diablo

[00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:17.010]
And it was outstanding

[00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:18.750]
And we had the black and white soup

[00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:23.110]
And we had my husband had the yellow tail snapper

[00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:26.110]
Oh, it's terrible to go there

[00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:27.130]
Did you have one of those here?

[00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:28.190]
Yeah, and then again

[00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:29.030]
Did you have the dessert?

[00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:31.310]
No, I didn't have any room for dessert

[00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:33.130]
We had that mocha creme brulee

[00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:34.030]
Oh, man

[00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:36.470]
Now I could not force another thing

[00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:39.710]
And we had the nachos beforehand in the soup

[00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:41.190]
And then we had the appetizers

[00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.950]
And that was funny

[00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:43.390]
They give you lots of food

[00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:43.790]
That would

[00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:45.930]
But no way, I couldn't eat all that

[00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:47.730]
I want to go back and try salad and dessert

[00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:48.690]
Well, try that

[00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:50.930]
When you try dessert, try that mocha creme brulee

[00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:52.950]
It's got like a real thick crust on it

[00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:55.590]
In fact, next week, Marwan's going to go out and put some of that crust

[00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:57.550]
From the mocha creme brulee and somebody's pants

[00:33:57.550 --> 00:33:58.730]
I believe it

[00:33:58.730 --> 00:33:59.950]
But it's tremendous

[00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:01.510]
But don't tell Rick

[00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:02.450]
I won

[00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:05.250]
Yeah, because I just want him to know that Sud's had the better suggestion

[00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:05.910]
Some other

[00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:06.770]
What are both great?

[00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:08.510]
Yeah, but I lived close

[00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:10.990]
Being in Plantation Armadillo was closer

[00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:12.610]
And I was not disappointed at all

[00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:15.070]
From the outside, you'd never in a million years

[00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:16.450]
You would never know was anything there

[00:34:16.450 --> 00:34:18.710]
It's just like that kind of Yahoo Davy

[00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:21.310]
It's a heckley like I need to go get some muffler parts

[00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:22.530]
Well, I'm sure you're not

[00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:25.130]
Right, right, while you're pulling up your horse up to the hitch and post

[00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:27.750]
That's the right, this I'd heard Randy mention last night

[00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:32.110]
That she didn't get a memo about how much was collected for a cold milk

[00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:36.050]
She actually sat on the air how much you had collected

[00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:37.550]
Great, well good for her

[00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:39.210]
Yeah, she's getting her peas and cheese down

[00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:41.750]
Well, we're working extra hard on it

[00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:43.910]
Because she'll probably be over there pretty soon, so

[00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:45.750]
We're doing our best

[00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:47.990]
Oh, Neil, it'll be fun to have Hank though

[00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.590]
Yeah

[00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:52.050]
But I'd like to, did you read the article about Rick and the Herald?

[00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:55.590]
I've just been perusing, yes, I've just been picking little spots

[00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:57.450]
And realized when a nice guy was

[00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.690]
Who said that?

[00:34:59.110 --> 00:34:59.510]
The Herald

[00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:03.150]
He talked about it, does that mean he has some personal things in his mind?

[00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:05.730]
Oh no, and that respect the out, but don't let it fool you

[00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:08.890]
But I do agree that he has gotten a little bit

[00:35:08.890 --> 00:35:12.030]
Less of a homer, listening to him on the radio can be

[00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:14.470]
While he's, uh, it's said he's going to loan him his compass

[00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:17.750]
Which direction should he go?

[00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:19.450]
Exactly, where is that ball?

[00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:20.270]
Have a great weekend

[00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:20.710]
Thank

[00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:22.010]
Okay, 114

[00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:24.650]
The classic 1010

[00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:26.990]
10 rocket more classics in a row

[00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:29.690]
On 97 GTR

[00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:31.210]
You don't play the running sisters

[00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:36.250]
Oh man, there's some heavy-duty stuff in there

[00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:38.070]
And here's one that doesn't even have a label on it

[00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:39.190]
It's probably blank

[00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:41.970]
Get ready with your finger on that button

[00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:43.130]
Fort Loddell Florida

[00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:43.610]
Hello

[00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:45.230]
Hello Larry, first time caller

[00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.630]
Hi

[00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:47.770]
Listening on WIOD610

[00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:50.350]
I mean, my old station

[00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:51.630]
Yeah, your old station

[00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:55.070]
Two two things I wanted to get your comments on Neil Rogers

[00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:56.710]
Both professionally and personally

[00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:58.930]
What, I gotta tell you this

[00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:01.350]
This is, people will never believe this

[00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:03.490]
This cart hasn't even got a label on it

[00:36:03.490 --> 00:36:04.570]
And I had no idea what it was

[00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:05.630]
It's in the bottom of the thing

[00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:06.910]
There were all this GTR stuff

[00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:08.210]
And there it is

[00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:10.570]
It's almost like an old man

[00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:11.270]
And also

[00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:13.950]
How would you go about getting into talk radio

[00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:14.910]
And I'll hang up and listen

[00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:15.570]
Someone called earlier

[00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:17.130]
I haven't heard Neil in years

[00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:19.310]
I have no idea

[00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:22.890]
I remember the time when he came on the air

[00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:24.050]
And came out of the closet

[00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:24.590]
Yeah

[00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:26.750]
And then I left my army shortly after that

[00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:27.550]
I have not heard him

[00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:28.750]
Since

[00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:31.430]
Uh, he does a kind of shock value

[00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:32.430]
It's not my kind of

[00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:34.830]
I'm told he does a shock value

[00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:35.810]
He showed it, you know

[00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:37.770]
What can I say next to shock you

[00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:39.590]
And that's not my kind of speed

[00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:41.490]
As a worker, but I haven't heard him in

[00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:43.110]
13 years

[00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:44.490]
Nashville, hello

[00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:45.610]
Hahaha

[00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:47.750]
Hahaha

[00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:49.110]
Wow

[00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:51.750]
Boy, thank God we saved that

[00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:54.690]
119 on a very Larry King intensive Friday

[00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:55.670]
It means there must probably

[00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:57.510]
I'm probably winning $50 tonight, right?

[00:36:57.590 --> 00:36:58.070]
At Pompedow

[00:36:58.070 --> 00:36:59.110]
That's what it sounds like

[00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:01.130]
Unlabeled old GTR carts

[00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:03.330]
And finally Michael, I know it's a holiday

[00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:05.930]
And President Bush is vacationing

[00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:07.670]
And Kenny Bunkport main

[00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:09.690]
And join the day off from the White House

[00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:10.490]
But hey

[00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:11.950]
I still want to give him a call

[00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:13.290]
And say happy Fourth of July

[00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:15.870]
After all, it is the nation's birthday

[00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:16.710]
Okay

[00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:19.350]
Well now, Jury's still out

[00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:20.990]
Sure, spray cans

[00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:22.610]
Maybe bad for the ozone

[00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:23.030]
But

[00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:25.350]
Do you go and take away bars, Cam

[00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:26.830]
The VO5

[00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:27.310]
Well

[00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:29.750]
She'll look just like Edgar Winter

[00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:38.010]
Boy, we got some wild stuff

[00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:39.510]
A little channel 7 car there

[00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:40.170]
It's incredible

[00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:42.210]
And speaking of wild stuff

[00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:43.330]
Daniel, are you doing?

[00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:45.250]
You'll never guess who's on the phone now

[00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:47.750]
Boy, this is pretty heavy duty

[00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:49.030]
Pretty heavy duty

[00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:50.290]
I'm not just stop

[00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:51.370]
I'm not just stop

[00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:52.990]
Alright, first of all, you're shouting

[00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:54.210]
Okay, we can hear you

[00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:56.110]
I know you're emotional

[00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:57.730]
And you're trying to flex your muscles

[00:37:57.730 --> 00:37:58.890]
I want to be on the beach

[00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:00.570]
I know how it is

[00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:02.250]
But just relax, take a deep breath

[00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:03.210]
We've got lots of time

[00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:04.090]
Okay, okay

[00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:06.670]
Let's just aimalyze the entire situation now

[00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:07.550]
I'd fight it exactly

[00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:09.670]
If you guys are as disloyal and uh

[00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:11.290]
Well, I just want to say one thing to start

[00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:12.930]
I didn't call Ian calls

[00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:14.110]
Buy himself alone

[00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:15.790]
You're not there, didn't know about that

[00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:16.170]
We didn't know about that

[00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:17.070]
Buy himself alone

[00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:17.630]
What?

[00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:19.650]
Wait a minute, hold on a second

[00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:20.550]
What line is out?

[00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:20.850]
Quick

[00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:22.930]
She's gone

[00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:24.730]
Oh, she's gone

[00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:26.230]
That was the old bag, she hung up

[00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:26.630]
Hello

[00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:28.070]
Yeah, go ahead, I'm sorry

[00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:29.330]
Yeah, well like I said

[00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:31.370]
I did not call him, I never called Ian calls

[00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:31.870]
Yeah

[00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:33.610]
That's not bad, I mean

[00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:34.950]
I'm just gonna call him

[00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:36.370]
Yeah, but weren't you on with me

[00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:38.770]
With Ian a couple of weeks ago

[00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:40.070]
With news broke that Mr.

[00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:42.250]
A pain was coming back on the air

[00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:43.610]
Yeah, but I wasn't as deep before

[00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:44.690]
And you were saying

[00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:47.030]
Oh boy, we are so ecstatic

[00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:48.450]
And boy, this is gonna be great

[00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:50.430]
Those guys are okay, but we're all okay

[00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:52.950]
And weren't you the same guys that came on with them

[00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:54.930]
In the beginning when they first came on in the afternoon

[00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:56.650]
And sucking around and calling together

[00:38:56.650 --> 00:38:58.250]
And I mean, I don't understand

[00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:00.950]
What kind of loyalties you guys have got

[00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:03.570]
Well, I want to help you see you

[00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:05.450]
Nice, oh, geez

[00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:08.170]
You know, this is incredible

[00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:11.070]
This is even such a standard with his mouth down

[00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:12.870]
It was to the thing down there

[00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:14.150]
And the other of you can't believe you

[00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:16.770]
How can you call guys on the air

[00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:18.290]
And go on about how great they are

[00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:19.490]
And become a little superstar

[00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:21.170]
You're like a radio butterfly

[00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:23.310]
You're like a butterfly

[00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:25.570]
Aren't you embarrassed

[00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:27.490]
I don't know, I have nothing to say

[00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:29.530]
No, no, that's not an answer

[00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:30.910]
Well, no

[00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:32.370]
Calvin, but you're up a little bit

[00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:33.330]
I know it won't be easy

[00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:34.110]
But what is it?

[00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:36.890]
Why, isn't it if he came before Rick and Sub came on

[00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:37.530]
Yeah, and then

[00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:38.470]
Well, that is never gonna stop

[00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:40.030]
But I always been listening to you

[00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:41.450]
No, no, don't say

[00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:42.530]
Oh, you sound like Steve

[00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:43.430]
You're sucking around me

[00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:44.270]
And that's not gonna work

[00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:45.590]
That doesn't play with me

[00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:46.910]
But we're not discussing me

[00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:48.330]
We know this show is great, okay

[00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:48.630]
Okay

[00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:51.010]
The bottom line is two to six in the afternoon

[00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:52.290]
You've got your choice

[00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:53.990]
You can let's have some fun with Rick and Sub

[00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:55.090]
I'm gonna talk on some

[00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:56.350]
Or you can listen to a man

[00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:57.850]
Making a living on the air

[00:39:57.850 --> 00:40:00.430]
Self-promoting with 85 minute breaks and traffic

[00:40:00.430 --> 00:40:02.350]
And the trying to figure out how to get out of that little room

[00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:04.010]
And if you want that's fine

[00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:05.350]
But I don't understand why

[00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:07.030]
One day these guys are great

[00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.950]
And you're having a great time

[00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:09.110]
And the next day you're like

[00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:09.810]
Sucking around

[00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:11.630]
Is that what you want to be known for all your life

[00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:12.550]
Is sucking around

[00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:15.270]
I don't look fine

[00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:16.550]
Come on

[00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:17.430]
All right, okay

[00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:18.650]
Stand up for yourself

[00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:19.530]
Don't be such a wimp

[00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:20.550]
Just because he has got you

[00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:21.270]
You know

[00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:23.350]
In a submissive kind of an attitude

[00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:25.230]
Well, I do, I do like Steve Kane

[00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:26.250]
I mean, that's a thing now

[00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:27.150]
What do you like about him?

[00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:29.130]
Uh, he's a fundamentalist

[00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:29.810]
Fun?

[00:40:30.350 --> 00:40:30.630]
Yeah

[00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:32.090]
How about that show Tuesday

[00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:34.070]
The four-hour funeral for Mayor Cahoney

[00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:35.250]
On air, did you listen to that show?

[00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:36.030]
No, I didn't listen to that one

[00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:36.390]
Why not?

[00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:37.750]
Because of Tuesday

[00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:40.270]
Tuesday don't listen to that anymore

[00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:42.330]
Oh, would you have listened to it?

[00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:44.430]
Uh, oh, we not, really

[00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:46.150]
Oh, why not

[00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:47.710]
Cause that probably wouldn't have been boring

[00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:48.090]
Oh

[00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:50.050]
And what's going on?

[00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:50.850]
I'm not saying he's great

[00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:52.810]
And like he's not saying he's the end of the world

[00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:54.170]
I'm trying to have a conversation with you

[00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:55.670]
I'm not trying to sell one way or the other

[00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:56.710]
Cause to reach its own

[00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:57.850]
If whatever makes you happy

[00:40:57.850 --> 00:40:58.310]
Yeah

[00:40:58.310 --> 00:41:00.470]
What about when Ellis Rubin is going to be on

[00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:01.810]
Would, uh, is that going to be fun?

[00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:03.170]
Oh, it's going, Mr. Newell, see

[00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:04.650]
What about when Rick Ciderman is

[00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:05.610]
And what you've heard all those

[00:41:05.610 --> 00:41:06.630]
Guest of a million times

[00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:07.770]
If you're a Steve Kane listener

[00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:08.490]
Haven't you?

[00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:09.630]
Yeah, but I don't know

[00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:10.590]
Remember what to have to say

[00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:12.890]
Oh, the next three laps

[00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:13.770]
Surely what I'm saying

[00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:15.950]
Absence makes the parts grow fonder

[00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:17.270]
Yeah, you might be right

[00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:18.390]
But they

[00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:19.350]
Doesn't have a lot of commercials

[00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:20.230]
I will say that

[00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:21.130]
Yeah, it's bad

[00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:21.730]
Great

[00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:22.910]
All the time

[00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:24.110]
Well, why don't you, when we just take

[00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:24.970]
Have a telephone

[00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:26.550]
A collection and take up the money

[00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:28.450]
And, uh, you know, maybe you can do a show

[00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:29.710]
Yeah, I'm a kid

[00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:30.830]
But I'm a kid

[00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:34.590]
You're Waffling Kelvin

[00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:35.090]
I know

[00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:37.270]
Well, I'm frustrated

[00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:39.350]
You should be flustered

[00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:41.310]
Rick Rallye is wounded

[00:41:41.310 --> 00:41:44.610]
He's heard he's a sensitive emotional basket case already

[00:41:44.610 --> 00:41:47.230]
And you guys are like, uh, butterflies

[00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:49.790]
One day they're great, now Steve's great

[00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:51.730]
And if like, uh, some real famous person

[00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:53.730]
Like John McHugh comes on the afternoon on QA

[00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:55.130]
And he'll be calling him and say, you're great

[00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:56.650]
Why don't you

[00:41:57.310 --> 00:41:57.970]
Why don't you

[00:41:57.970 --> 00:41:59.330]
No, definitely not

[00:41:59.330 --> 00:42:01.590]
I think the least you can do like Monday is a holiday

[00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:03.670]
Is come over here and take your clothes off in a studio

[00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:05.330]
The least you can do to make up for it

[00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:06.690]
Ah, how about Tuesday

[00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:07.530]
Okay

[00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:08.230]
Okay, Tuesday

[00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:09.030]
See you

[00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.550]
All right, bye

[00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:11.050]
Let's try Fort Lauderdale

[00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:12.190]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[00:42:12.310 --> 00:42:12.610]
Okay

[00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:14.390]
I heard a room where I want to know if it's true

[00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:16.370]
Yeah, I heard you were a Faggot, is that true?

[00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:16.950]
A what?

[00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:17.650]
A Faggot?

[00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:18.290]
Pansy

[00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:21.690]
Oh, Ian is on the phone

[00:42:21.690 --> 00:42:22.710]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:23.550]
Oh, boy

[00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:25.330]
You guys are just out of control

[00:42:25.330 --> 00:42:27.570]
You need to get like a life transplant, you too

[00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:28.290]
I was listening in the car

[00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:30.010]
I want to tell you, Rick Riley and Sutscomb

[00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:33.050]
I'd like to come to your house and beat the crap out of you with a 2x4

[00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:34.630]
Calvin needs to push up a little bit

[00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:36.130]
Yeah, well that was a wimpy call

[00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:38.590]
I mean, what at least admit that you guys are butterflies

[00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:39.930]
And you're insincere

[00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:42.090]
And you're like, uh, suck around everybody

[00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:43.450]
Uh, that's not true

[00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:44.210]
Mostly each other

[00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:45.930]
Markets up 30 points

[00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:47.670]
I would never fly away from you, Neil

[00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:49.410]
See, you're doing the same thing

[00:42:49.410 --> 00:42:51.350]
He was doing, I'm not impressed by that

[00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:54.870]
That's the oldest chronic talk radio uh,

[00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:56.630]
Tactic in the world, to suck around with the host

[00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:58.210]
It, I see through that, see

[00:42:58.210 --> 00:43:00.570]
You're not talking to Alex Bennett now

[00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:01.390]
No, but it's just you

[00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:02.930]
I never spoke to Alex Bennett

[00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:06.010]
Yeah, right, but if you would have, oh, Alex, you're the greatest

[00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:08.530]
Can we come down to be in your live studio audience?

[00:43:08.830 --> 00:43:10.270]
So can we come down and suck around

[00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:11.530]
Eat your food and ruin your show?

[00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:12.690]
Of course, he didn't need any help

[00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:15.570]
No, but okay, well, you won't believe it, but

[00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:16.850]
I don't believe you already

[00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:19.890]
Because when you preface the statement by saying you won't believe me

[00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:21.430]
It's pretty obvious that you're full of it

[00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:23.310]
Well, because you don't believe me so

[00:43:23.310 --> 00:43:24.370]
I preface it

[00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:26.770]
Well, what's uh, what's the philonia statement

[00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:27.590]
I know it's just to say that, you know

[00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:30.470]
I mean, I'll be listening to you and Steve Kane

[00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:32.530]
Originally, that's how we knew Steve Kane before

[00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:34.130]
What does that have to do with Rick and Putt?

[00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:35.730]
No, it's really nothing to do with it

[00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:37.190]
I mean, I don't have nothing against him

[00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:38.350]
I don't really care about him either

[00:43:38.350 --> 00:43:39.630]
But the point is

[00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:41.710]
See, you both are missing the point

[00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:42.590]
If you were just like

[00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:44.770]
Kind of like casual callers

[00:43:44.770 --> 00:43:46.770]
And you were part of the vast audience

[00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:48.010]
Out there, the passing parade

[00:43:48.010 --> 00:43:49.030]
That would be one thing

[00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:51.030]
But I have a good memory, okay?

[00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:52.530]
And I remember back in the beginning

[00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:54.270]
When these guys first came on his station

[00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:56.290]
The two of you always entanned him

[00:43:56.290 --> 00:43:57.350]
Like joined at the thing

[00:43:57.350 --> 00:43:58.570]
We're always on the phone

[00:43:58.570 --> 00:43:59.870]
Just heaving

[00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:01.110]
You're relating all over them

[00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:02.230]
And just carrying on

[00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:03.230]
And oh, I mean, you were just

[00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:05.070]
It was just phenomenal

[00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:06.330]
It was mind-boggling

[00:44:06.330 --> 00:44:07.350]
And then all of a sudden

[00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:10.270]
The first day Mr. Contrivedigo comes back on you

[00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:11.870]
Oh boy, they're okay

[00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:13.010]
But boy, he's really

[00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:14.290]
And then I ask your pal

[00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:15.010]
What's so great?

[00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:15.710]
What do you enjoy?

[00:44:15.850 --> 00:44:16.350]
Did you hear this?

[00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:18.370]
Oh no, well, I can't listen on that day

[00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:20.270]
And oh no, if I heard this, it would probably be boring

[00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:22.490]
Say, on your doing is you're just

[00:44:23.110 --> 00:44:24.130]
I don't know what you're doing

[00:44:24.130 --> 00:44:25.210]
What are you doing?

[00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:26.170]
I don't know

[00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:26.550]
What do you want to be?

[00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:27.570]
Trouble makers, is that?

[00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:28.830]
No, I don't want to be trouble makers

[00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:30.050]
A trouble maker

[00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:31.710]
Trying to get Rick Riley's blood pressure up

[00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:34.630]
And cause him to have some kind of a cardiovascular accident, sir

[00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:35.970]
At least he's got a nice car, though

[00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:37.150]
Play some good music today, Johnny

[00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:37.850]
What is it?

[00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:39.630]
At least he's got a nice car to go home in, though

[00:44:40.330 --> 00:44:40.610]
Rick

[00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:41.770]
I'm not kicking you out of here

[00:44:41.770 --> 00:44:43.530]
But it's time to go on to your, Johnny Dork

[00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:45.330]
There he goes over to the coast

[00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:45.890]
Right

[00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:49.110]
He took a big, a big thing of helium before it went over there

[00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:49.710]
Okay

[00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:51.150]
It's 82 along the coast

[00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:52.030]
I can hear it right now

[00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:53.110]
He's going to be great today

[00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:53.590]
I don't know

[00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:54.310]
He's last day

[00:44:54.310 --> 00:44:55.270]
I want to tell you

[00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:56.910]
No, no, don't try to change the subject

[00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:58.950]
We still have about a minute to go here

[00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:02.150]
I want you to try to explain to these poor guys

[00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:03.690]
Why you are a turncoat

[00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:05.510]
I mean, no reason

[00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:09.130]
You're like the Angus Allen of radio

[00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:10.190]
Or was it Ethan Allen

[00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:12.070]
Or Ethan, whatever his name was

[00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:14.610]
No, I'm not like, I mean, anything like a Gilbert

[00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:16.190]
I'm not even close

[00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:17.230]
I listen to you

[00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:18.030]
Your turncoat

[00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:18.990]
I listen to you

[00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:19.950]
Rick and Suz

[00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:20.730]
And Steve Cato

[00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:21.270]
Or Steve Cato

[00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:22.330]
I've ever listened on AM radio

[00:45:22.330 --> 00:45:24.570]
Yeah, well, you're still not responding to our question

[00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:25.130]
Well, I mean

[00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:27.630]
I mean, why did I turn on him?

[00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:28.390]
Is that what the question was?

[00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:28.870]
Yeah

[00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:30.470]
No reason, really

[00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:31.570]
I still was listening to them

[00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:32.690]
So Steve Cane came back

[00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:33.110]
Yeah

[00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:35.630]
Well, that's really it

[00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:37.610]
Did you like the Myra Khan issue?

[00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:39.910]
No, that was that day I didn't listen

[00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:41.710]
Are you going to listen when Ellis Rubin is on?

[00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:44.590]
Actually, I think Ellis Rubin is kind of in it

[00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:46.130]
I don't even know who that is

[00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:46.410]
Oh

[00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:47.570]
I mean, I know you

[00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:50.190]
How about Reverend, Reverend Unic Polis

[00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:51.450]
I actually like I told him yesterday

[00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:52.790]
And you run lady into that?

[00:45:53.570 --> 00:45:54.210]
That's kind of

[00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:56.510]
Because I know the British are into that tea in the afternoon

[00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:58.950]
Well, I don't know

[00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:00.930]
Yeah, I think you guys are kind of like

[00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:02.530]
Spend a real club

[00:46:02.530 --> 00:46:05.430]
Maybe go up to a New Hampshire or something for the weekend together

[00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:06.790]
We wait one day

[00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:09.110]
Kind of cozy up in front of a warm fire

[00:46:09.110 --> 00:46:11.450]
And discuss this under less pressure

[00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:12.590]
When you're away from all the

[00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:15.250]
Immediate pressures of this radio market

[00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:17.070]
And kind of gets your thing together

[00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:20.250]
You know, like in January, I might be going out to University of Maryland

[00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:21.170]
Oh promise

[00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:22.530]
I'm going to be depressed

[00:46:22.530 --> 00:46:24.270]
How about I can listen to you every day

[00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:26.230]
Well, you can pick up FTL up there, I'm sure

[00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:28.030]
Have a great weekend, Ian

[00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:28.570]
You too

[00:46:28.570 --> 00:46:29.370]
You're full of it

[00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:29.730]
Okay

[00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:33.410]
Wow, boy, a couple of radio phonies there

[00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:34.750]
They're not full in any of you folks

[00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:36.430]
You're a lot too sharp for that, right?
