[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]
We don't work together. There's no reason we need to be friends.

[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.140]
So he came in here. Apparently was not feeling well. He sat down. He said, I have nothing to say.

[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.300]
Nothing to do. I'm going to open the phone lines. Give everybody a minute. I'm not going to say anything.

[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.300]
And I ripped him for a half hour. You know, it would be great, which I know we don't have in the building.

[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.380]
Oh, we might. It's a radio station close to it. You know, those halls meant to look this.

[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.100]
Yes. Boy, why don't I have a table? You mean some of those, Neil?

[00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.600]
Yeah. Do you have something? I will go and search.

[00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.740]
No, I'm not going to be halls, mental. No, but it can't be something with sugar in it like life.

[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.900]
Like a lasage. Yeah. Just for you. That would be great. Okay. Then I could make it till

[00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.440]
a cloud. I'll be back. And then you guys could do two to six. Oh, excuse me. Okay, 1047.

[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.200]
I something's going on. I use. See, he's gone. Now you get. Yeah. What?

[00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:54.320]
Look for some car. No, putts. Sit down. No, I'm fine. This is warm. So what happened Thursday? He was in a bad

[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.100]
mood. He was at a pretty bad mood. Yeah. About what? I don't know about what? Why?

[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.000]
Generally, I just said when I was going out the door out of the main door here, we kind of came face to

[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.540]
face. He did an above face and went into the next office and stood until I left with you. Oh, man.

[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.140]
I, gee. What does he want to kick your teeth into? Why? I certainly hope so. Boy, trying to have a sore foot

[00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:22.040]
by the time he gets to. So I don't know what the deal was. Everybody Jim Robinson,

[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.720]
the V. Matt Jim. He's a new guy who books guests on Alex's show and one thing and another. He was

[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.400]
upset and even was upset. And I never saw a new guy that books his guests. Well, what's he going

[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:41.100]
to do now? I don't know where he come from. I don't know. Nice guy. Yeah, but out of work.

[00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:49.020]
Right? Well, come on. Say something could possibly be. I don't know. I'm not trying to put words

[00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.160]
in your mouth. I'm just trying to put your teeth back in your mouth. Okay, that he's going to kick

[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.600]
down your throat. But it was a lot of things. I just noticed for the first time we have a big teeth.

[00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.360]
Yes, symmetrical. Good teeth. If you ever put them together, it would say something. Okay, it's 12

[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.000]
minutes till 11 is the mystery continues at W. I. D. The world's best pizza. The world's best

[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.640]
Italian goodies at pizza loft. I understand through the grapevine. Yes. I just continued his excellent

[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.560]
work while you guys were here. Definitely did that and filled your skinny faces. I was going to say

[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.600]
fat faces, but neither one of you is fat. All of you keep it up. You will be. And you're just

[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.760]
going to love the pizza. I mean, it doesn't get any better. Everything is made free. Why?

[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.540]
It doesn't look good. How bad? Why? What have you seen? You saw my number still?

[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.620]
Well, what is overall from a 4 1?

[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.940]
Let me get the actual. Well, no, is it down from a 4 1? How much?

[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.180]
Do we need like how much? How much lower can it get? How could it go down to a 3 something?

[00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.560]
Two? I don't remember the. Well, go get it. Don't stand here. There he goes with his rumors again.

[00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:04.480]
It's stinking fat rich boy. I told you the book is going to be bad. Wow. Oh boy. So when

[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:13.800]
you guys start anyway 10 52 at WIO D Miami. Well, Neil. Yes, sir. This is Roberto Clemente. How you

[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.600]
don't, Roberto? I want you to do your heart of favorite and switch to the pirates. Yeah. Good luck

[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.940]
to you. Neil, they look pretty good though this weekend. I got to be honest with you. I am calling

[00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.960]
here from Kendall. I have to congratulations for Alex Benetees. He's going to be our new assistant

[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.480]
manager in charge of French fries. Good. Well, he's looking for something. You know,

[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.220]
a job. We have a little paper hat and a little triangle hat. We'd like to ship to him and

[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.360]
bet him put that on that little ball. Your cruel guy, Roberto, okay? That plane crash must have

[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.300]
done him to you. I have been following every time. I have been following the WIO D sawed

[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.960]
a gravely. Yeah. And the peers that WIO D had hired somebody who apparently has its

[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:59.920]
tremendous complex, a very insecure person. Who I thought honestly was about to lose it over the

[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.360]
year. Really? He was that man. You know, the thing that I find amazing is all I'm asking is what

[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.220]
happened on Thursday and nobody will tell me they keep making generalizations, but nobody will

[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.280]
tell me what the man did in this chair. Although I noticed there's little marks and spots, but

[00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.360]
I'm not sure what they're from, you know? Well, as far as spicking spots go, I noticed that

[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.780]
spots that's most I've never heard him talk. I thought I knew. He's wound up like a ball of fire

[00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.940]
today. I guess it's nice to have a job again. No one hit what it is is once you got Rick out of the room

[00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.900]
to go get those. Yeah. Yeah. He's intimidated by Rick. You know, how the bird used to say I was

[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.780]
intimidating. Well, it's the same thing with these guys. He's intimidated by Rick Riley.

[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.000]
Well, I do hope and I'm not insinuating anything, but I hope they do find employment

[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.920]
like very soon. They were excellent on Waxi, but I think they're much, much better now because

[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.840]
they're given the opportunity to talk and they do it quite well. Yeah. Mahl, what can I tell you?

[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.100]
Didn't get a card from Ricky Tiki, by the way. I'm a little disappointed. He sends his best. I'm sure.

[00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.000]
Okay. Neil, welcome you back. Okay. Thanks a lot. Say hi to Danny Murtau, former. Okay.

[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:08.120]
1054 WY. Oh, geez. Oh, should I get out the dead? It was really bad. It is.

[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:15.580]
He's not staying. It must be. What is this? Well, wait a minute. Where's the first page?

[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:29.120]
Oh, I guess you don't know. Oh, my God. Look at that from a five two in the fall book to a three eight

[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:36.960]
from a third to 10th. This is the overall numbers. Well, that's the lowest number in a dog's age.

[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:48.160]
A three eight boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. They didn't give me the first page. They didn't bother. I don't know why.

[00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.780]
CMQ FM beat us. Well, let's see. Where's wins? Wins had a three four. We just barely beat them.

[00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.340]
How about W snooze? How did they do? They went from a two nine to a two two.

[00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:08.640]
Who Zeta from a one seven to a two three now we better check out GTR from a two one in the fall book to a two oh. So that's that's spin.

[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:17.540]
That's flat, but boy from a five two to a three eight like the whole audience has disappeared. The entire audience disappeared.

[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.580]
Well, I hate to break the news to you, but I'm not going to make excuses. I already did that before I had my stroke.

[00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.660]
I went through the whole business about all the changes and the insistent

[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:32.020]
jerking around with the audience. Mornings five five to a four nine.

[00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.300]
Boy, we're going to start a death knell in midday. That'll be next.

[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.180]
Renery had a four nine. Well, it's not too bad. Not great.

[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.740]
But I think in the last trendy at a four eight so he went back up.

[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:51.760]
So on issue we must have gone in the toilet boy. We must have gone in the toilet. Man, you guys better stick around.

[00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.680]
And the one else midday who be this or in the morning life.

[00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.400]
Ornieri went from third to fourth in the morning. That's not so bad. That's not bad.

[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.520]
No, especially when the whole station had a death knell.

[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.300]
And do you think there was a big drop in the afternoon?

[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.440]
Do I think so personally?

[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:14.320]
Well, I don't have one. I don't know. Huh? It was only one book. So I don't know.

[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.940]
Well, what is this? Okay. I'll say, yeah, I think I'll write that down.

[00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.580]
This is I call him and stay away from me. January, February and March.

[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.980]
Now when did he come here? It came January. Alex Kim in January. Late January. Yeah.

[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:32.180]
So he was here most of the book. Yeah. Like more than two thirds. Well, say two thirds. Yeah. Okay.

[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.820]
I had a five, three and the last trend. It could be under a five. What would that be? A death knell, huh?

[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.300]
But we don't know. Wonder they kept calling and say, hey, don't hurry back. Stay out as long as you want.

[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:52.300]
Is this bad? A little bit. A little bit what? Oh, no, that's not that bad.

[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:57.700]
6.0 to a five. One. Well, that's up. What was the trend? A five, three. Hey, listen,

[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:03.480]
it's better than a chop liver. Okay. When the station goes in the toilet from fourth to fifth,

[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.720]
that's midday. This show 6.0 to a five. One. Call a bird. Get him back.

[00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:13.200]
Now, don't start that crap, man. No way. Oh, God. Talk about having bad health.

[00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:17.200]
Life had a nine, six and midday. I don't know. These are boring, aren't they?

[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.000]
Why do I give these numbers? No, no. Huh?

[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.660]
Nobody cares except the people who worked there. Like at this. Oh, I wonder how did

[00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:30.960]
Calder show up in the morning here? I'm sure he's listening. Yes. One, one to a point seven,

[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:35.580]
but then he was gone the last part of that. Yeah. It was about the last month. What a bit of a, yeah.

[00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:40.960]
So the only number they've had above a one in the morning was when he was there. And of course,

[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.820]
they treated him like cramp, but he'll go into that when he comes on the show. Who else?

[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:50.340]
Well, Vue Del called me at home too. Greg Vue Del, nice. Yeah. In fact, yeah. And he said,

[00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:54.260]
I miss you ripping us. So Greg, you're a douchebag. They had from a two six to a two five in the

[00:08:54.260 --> 00:09:00.020]
morning. They're 12 plus on gloves 94. Anybody else? There's nobody else in the market. Is there? How

[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:06.140]
did the Debbie Ellis or who's on midday? Debbie Ellis? Yeah. I had a five one. Well,

[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:09.440]
the station had a three eight and I had a five one. Hey, listen, I'm not going to complain about

[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.460]
that. We still got the top number on the station, right? Still working. That's the bottom line.

[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:19.940]
Oh, look at that. Two five to a three six midday on love. Now is that Irene Richard went to midday?

[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.800]
How long go that? I don't lose on their mid days. I don't think she's been there that long. Nice

[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:28.360]
go. And Irene will give you credit for boys. They don't want eight to a two seven. They've turned

[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:32.020]
the corner man. So who believes these numbers? There's nobody listening to that station.

[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:38.440]
They're still playing CCR every two minutes. WNWS midday two seven to a two six. Oh, how did Alice

[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:45.580]
Rand tell do in the morning? That's the question. Okay. One moment, please. Let's see if we can get

[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:51.740]
down that many pages six to 10 a.m. The motivation station got a point six. Let's hear it for them.

[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:58.780]
They got on the list. K T had a one in the morning. Where is Alice? Oh, Alice had above a two.

[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:04.280]
I don't know. Wait a minute. This has got to be a mistake. Just a minute. I must be seeing

[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:09.980]
you think. Oh, here it is three one to a two one. So that is kind of a precipitous drop. When

[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:13.960]
you drop a whole point, you only start with a three. You're not doing too great, right? That's

[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:18.280]
right. You know, when you got a six in your drop of point, that's so bad, right? No, you bounce back.

[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:24.380]
You feel good. I doubt it. I feel I don't think we're finished. Anyway, that that's going to do it

[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:30.120]
for this hour. A guy named Chuck on a hotline. Well, that's what I'll for off the year. For on the

[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:34.460]
year. Okay, we'll find out who gave him my number in just a minute. Anyway, who's doing news?

[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:38.820]
Henry Barrows doing those Henry still here just like clockwork, just like the mold on the floor.

[00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.060]
And then we'll come back with more depressing numbers at 1105.

[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.560]
If these people ever appear again on this radio station, I'm walking out the floor.

[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:07.700]
Oh, excuse me. You'd bad. Oh, that was awful. Why not? Just slipped down. It's 1107 and WIOD.

[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:15.120]
WIOD. NIL. Hold on. And the number is suck. The station went in the toilet. But at least we

[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.480]
talk about it. We're not going to make any excuses. They made all these changes. They keep jerk

[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:23.700]
any audience around. We had a good thing going here. And as much as I did, I don't want to say it

[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:28.840]
again. I already said all of this. And I had a stroke, you know, Kane. I hate him like poison.

[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:34.740]
Impossible to like. He's a pain in the ass. His guests were repetitive and boring. But he had a

[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:39.380]
number, a reasonable number. And we had a lot of business on there. Okay. He did well. Station was

[00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:45.260]
kicking ass. And they started screwing around, messing with success. They got a history at all

[00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:51.140]
these stations in this market, changing and changing and change. So when you guys start, it's 1108

[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:57.080]
at WIOD. And no, that would be a great change. That would be a good change. Who's going to give

[00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:02.940]
me a soda, by the way, died. Oh, the average for me a soda, died coke, caffeine free. What is it?

[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:13.480]
What is that? Well, what is that? Oh, men 25 to 54. I had an eight six from number one to number

[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:17.180]
two. But that's not just the number I need. I have to have the women to have to have the overall

[00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:24.120]
25 54. It's not in yet. Adults 25 to 54 because I'm sure that I blew my bonus. Boy,

[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:30.060]
I'll cry right on the ear. But that's a great deal. You went some, you lose some. Yeah, we just

[00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:35.400]
don't have that loyal audience like they do a WQBA. Now, who the hell is this guy in the bad line? Hello.

[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:43.940]
How are you, Neil? Okay. Glad to hear you. Who's this? My name is Chuck. You know me by sight. You

[00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:49.960]
would know me by name. Really? Yeah. But yeah, I've been in a couple of your votes. I'm the Michigan

[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:58.060]
state man. Would you get this number, Chuck? That rich long time ago. Anyway, I wish he was in the room,

[00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:02.040]
boy. I'd give anything if he was in the room. That rich gave you the hotline number.

[00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:07.080]
What you're soda before you bitch him out, okay? Oh, man. I was in the station Thursday when

[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:11.060]
Alligis is having his cramp on the air and even gives my home number out to people. He was very

[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:15.100]
Epstein my home number. I couldn't believe it. I just almost had a relapse at the house. I couldn't

[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:22.420]
believe it. This voice is going on and on and I'm so concerned about you. I said, who the hell is

[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:28.780]
this? Very Epstein. Don't you recognize my voice? It would be like Gilbert calling me at home,

[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:33.280]
you know? I was at all the hospital. I'm getting calls from callers. That would be very enjoyable.

[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:39.120]
Anyway, what's up, Chuck? I was sitting in the state. I'm Chuck. I know. I've only been

[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:45.980]
enjoying being on this afternoon, I guess. God help us all. Yeah. I was coming to 95. I was working

[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:49.920]
to work. You think a 3-8 is bad guys? Wait till you see what happened with Joey on here.

[00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:56.560]
Remember the number is it's she? God help us all. You could do a 1-8 easy. By the way, the afternoon

[00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:01.960]
3-5 to a 3-3 and a night 2-8 to a 2-6. Thank you, Melvin. You're a gentleman, a scholar and

[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:09.180]
a Jewish. What is it, sir? So we can't be all bad. I just wanted to let you know what I witnessed

[00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:14.680]
the balances on the air ramp on Thursday. You were here? I drove by the station. I happened to be

[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:19.100]
going by and he was just happened to be going by, right? And you know, I figured I'd come in

[00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:25.060]
and be in the audience and just listen for a little while, kill a little time. I weighed in the lobby

[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:32.100]
then about 20 after 2. It comes down and gets me. I get to the door and Alex says, I'm in no mood

[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:37.640]
for this. I don't want any audience today. Tell him all to stay the hell out. Didn't so much up

[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:42.720]
as look up at me, apologize. You're very discurdious. I mean, when your numbers are that low,

[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:49.740]
you'd better be nice to every listener you got. Yeah. So I like this act, but I don't have any

[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:56.460]
stomachs for discuracy. And that was just plain rude. But I'm glad you're back. Oh, by the way,

[00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:01.040]
who was it? Give you the bat line number again? That rich. Who just sat down here? That's remote.

[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:05.920]
Oh, now I got two soldiers. Now we got three soldiers. Look at that. You gave him the hotline number.

[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:13.360]
That's a croc, sir. What do you mean it's a croc? Oh, this man's credibility on a scale of zero

[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:18.640]
minus infinity. Oh, the brain trust is running around the hall of programming. People are running

[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:22.600]
up and down the hall. The sky is falling. The sky is falling. Chicken little chicken little.

[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:27.880]
That's good. Just keep making those changes, man. Just keep changing the programming like people

[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:32.060]
change their underwear. We can make a two by the fall book. If you work real hard, is okay?

[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:37.280]
Hey, Mr. May they put a radio aerobics class from Pudestor? And they're dumping stand too,

[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:41.020]
aren't they? Isn't that the, I mean, you know, let's keep making those changes. Well, listen,

[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:45.400]
have a nice stand. I'm glad you told us about fat rich. Glide your back. Thanks a lot. You are

[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:51.580]
impossible. It was very abstin my home numbers. Did you hear that story? I got a call. I don't either.

[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.820]
I don't want to know them. And then he called here on the bat line. You must have given them that

[00:15:54.820 --> 00:16:03.100]
number two. We need the bird back, I guess, huh? Draft from a six to a five one. But the one thing I

[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:08.100]
discover on this station, your numbers are like a buy, I said this before, like it's like an accordion.

[00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:13.320]
Your numbers are a byproduct of the overall station. So you can't compare it to what you did before.

[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:17.820]
All you can do is compare it to the number the station does. So if the station had a three eight,

[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:24.660]
I had a five one. I did great. So congratulations to me, right? That's right. Right. Yeah. Damn right.

[00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:32.400]
12 minutes. Isn't that right, sir? You got it. Hold on. Hey, I want to talk about the unicorn right.

[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:38.980]
Now boy, I should be okay, it's 1160. Now what is this? The latest rumor. Alex is out of town.

[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:47.160]
Warp looking for a job and we'll be back Wednesday on the year in the building back in town,

[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:53.220]
but not necessarily on the air. Oh, well, what do you make of that? I don't know. You know, it's first

[00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:58.080]
Thursday. Welcome back, by the way. Oh, don't worry about me. Let's hear what you really want to see.

[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:02.780]
I want to bash him. Now I'm going to like poison. That's what you want to do. I'm done. Basha. It was nice.

[00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:08.280]
He's teethed. You know, he's teeth on his goddamn throat. We know as far as Thursday's show goes,

[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:13.980]
I don't remember Thursday show it all kind of blends together. No, no, nobody will tell me what's

[00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:18.940]
going on. I feel like I feel like if I remember correctly, he opened the phone for a half hour and let

[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:23.000]
everybody say what they want and what happened? Well, everybody ripped the hell out of me begin with.

[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:28.520]
And then what? And then he in turn ripped Miami and how everybody down here sucks and me went in

[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:34.160]
Oh, by the way, speaking of that, what is this about the billboard? Oh, yeah, you have billboards.

[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:40.500]
Everybody sucks. They look like crap. No, he said that they have the billboard and that there

[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:44.720]
was something in my mouth. But the controversy was they had changed the billboard because it's in

[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:48.740]
bar is open. It looked like something else. What the hell are they thinking about here? They look

[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:52.380]
like crap. I saw them. I saw the world with the Ranieri. I saw the world with you whoever did

[00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:57.780]
those, whatever agency did, they should be shot. Because they're horrible. Really? Yeah, they're really.

[00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:03.360]
Now, have you seen the new Neil? Wait a minute. Why did you give me a frown when you gave me this?

[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:07.760]
You already told me what they were. You already said I had eight six. What's wrong with that? I mean,

[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:16.420]
it's down, but we're dropping like a rock. That's 10 to three. That includes two to three, sir. Okay,

[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:21.420]
which may have been somewhat down. Let's see a three to seven. What they did 25 to 54. Look at

[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:30.800]
that. They went up. How do you like that? Five four to five seven up in men. Well, that's because

[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:35.780]
you had all those naked broads in here. What did I have an eight six? What are we doing in the

[00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:42.820]
morning? Six five to a six three. That's not bad. We kind of held our own in men 25 to 54.

[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:51.080]
Didn't we? What did the station do? Seven five to a five night. Like I said, death now. And the

[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:56.840]
seven of midnight seven of midnight two nine to a three eight. Look at that. Stan. Got to give a

[00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:01.160]
Stan something you're excited about. Neil, something very exciting happened last week. I don't know if

[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:10.560]
anybody's talked about it. Yeah, but the suds kind of always do the deep breath. Okay, now suds

[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:16.700]
did what? Suds kind of had a coming out last week. I haven't put it back. I bet his wife's excited

[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:22.900]
about that. No, I heard more from suds last week than I have ever since I've ever heard. Oh, you

[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:27.260]
mean we're speaking. Oh, yeah, you got to do a great job, by the way. Thank you. All right, don't get

[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:31.540]
carried away. No numbers are pretty bad. You know, you know, and I could do you guys were cheap?

[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:38.100]
I tried to help this show and anywhere I could. And they did a great job. Yeah. And, you know,

[00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:44.180]
I hope everything works out for Alex for the best. Whatever that might be.

[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:50.040]
Yeah, Sammy, can you hear me? In other words, you wish him luck in Seattle. Then wherever you go. Maybe

[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:54.680]
he can pray to God. Dave can pray to call me too from Seattle. Yeah. See, I'm forgetting a lot of

[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:58.700]
people works for the front of ours. Yeah, really? The program director there. The program director,

[00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:03.740]
as a matter of fact, we hired as an intern. And now he's a PD and has a job. That's right. In fact,

[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:09.240]
he was down here just before I had my stroke. And he was getting a little depressed up there because

[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:12.840]
the weather is crappy. And they came back here for a couple of days and he realized he liked it

[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:20.700]
up there a lot. Anyway, in closing, please. Dr. Suck, you got to know man, I could tell I

[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:24.780]
wouldn't be boring, but I could tell you stories. I'd love to hear from now till the end of the day.

[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:28.320]
I mean, they just don't know what the hell they're doing. And then I had the I don't want to go into

[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:32.760]
who the personalities, but I want to thank Dr. J Skyler. I used to have my show all the time when I

[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:37.860]
did topics at the U of M Medical Center and the behavioral research center. He is the best. I don't

[00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:42.220]
know why I didn't call him right away, but I went there last week. And he was he just terrific.

[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:45.580]
And he's in a lot of good things for me and got my diet straightened out and I'm getting on the

[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:49.420]
right medication. And you know, it's going to take me a while. How do you feel? Do you feel normal?

[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:56.400]
I beg your pardon? No, I don't feel a little weak. I feel a little a little weak.

[00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:02.660]
As long as you're regular. Yeah. Every day. Okay. There he goes. The legend in his own mind.

[00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:07.160]
Twenty after eleven at WIODs, we come back to what do they want me to come back? We had the football

[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:11.440]
draft yesterday, which I noticed is still going on today. Here's Rick Alpo.

[00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:17.220]
Thank you, sir. Okay. What is that? Oh, those could be halls meant to look off. Thank you.

[00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:22.500]
There you go. Thank you very much. Oh, look at that vitamin. Vitamin seed drops.

[00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:26.520]
Oh, halls. Thank you, Rick. That's nice. Natural assorted, citrus flavor.

[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:31.420]
Oh, don't make my mouth perk up real good. So I have a what in my mouth now on this billboard?

[00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:38.760]
Now it's green. It used to be white. Yeah. It's a bar of soap. It's a bar of soap.

[00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:43.940]
It was kind of like a kind of dubious. I use this as a matter of maybe they have that.

[00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:48.520]
Maybe they're stupid around my bathroom. That's what it is. Oh, that's great. And they suck

[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:52.060]
according to him before it was ivory something. They sure now how to promote this station. You know,

[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:55.680]
if they really know how to promote, but I will say this, they were very nice. They sent my

[00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:01.700]
check over with Stan every week and you know, some more than they did for us. Bob Soap

[00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:05.980]
or another superstar. Hi Neil. How are you Bob? Thanks for the nice card, buddy. Oh,

[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:09.180]
welcome back. You know, Susan and I have missed you while you were gone. Thank you.

[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:12.480]
Any of us, some people do anything to get a couple of days off. Now, did that rich give you

[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:18.080]
this number, Bob? Yeah, rich gave it to me. He's incredible. He's everywhere. He's like the plague.

[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:22.280]
Well, we wish you well and hope that you feel better. Thank you.

[00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:27.000]
I don't have one. Ask you one other thing. Yeah. What the hell do you want? Exactly.

[00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:31.360]
I'm going to ask Disney that when I get off the air. Hi, Bob. Have a great day. Bob.

[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:35.980]
Thank you. Bob and us. They don't know what they want here. They don't know what they want.

[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:40.240]
I feel like I'm in on the Titanic like way down in the bowels of the ship, you know.

[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.280]
But I think they're going to make them real good move pretty soon. That's the rumor that seems

[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:49.220]
to be going around the building. Anyway, it's I think I said 22 after 11, but you can never give

[00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:53.060]
the time too much or the temperature by the way. These guys know that time and temperature,

[00:22:53.140 --> 00:23:00.180]
time and temperature, give it a lot, play those hits, right? Pump them out. These are delicious.

[00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:04.260]
Boy, they're extremely much better. I speak already. Oh, yeah. She's like a white horse. Oh,

[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:07.420]
God. Yeah. I had three of those before I had my stroke. Anyway,

[00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:12.720]
could have been the ice cream fudge cake in Pompa, no park that night.

[00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:17.840]
Specs music and video has acquired. Oh, I see. I'm reading the note to me from Bill Mullen. Well,

[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:22.080]
I would be good, wouldn't it? What? No, what they have now, it's specs. They've got the

[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:28.520]
ACN cassette and CD and all the Dylan. So you can just buy those. Yeah. Well, I mean, it's not all of them,

[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:32.980]
but it's got like a whole bunch. It's got 10 to 12 ACN bits on it. And you can play it on your CD

[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:38.640]
in the car or in your cassette if you're a popper. And it's a 50 minutes long. So they're like a

[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.900]
whole bunch of bits that we play on the year here. And you can drive around and crank it up in the

[00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:45.400]
car and open your windows. And maybe that way we'll get a little promotion. You say, hey, this is the

[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:51.440]
stuff they play on the Neil Rogers show W I O D 10 to 2 6 10 on the AM dial every day, which

[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:56.420]
would be better than those crappy billboards with that thing in my mouth, whatever it is, the cassette

[00:23:56.420 --> 00:24:03.760]
is only 99. I'm a cup fan and a bud man. And I trust you are too. No, wait a minute. Oh, I see,

[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:07.500]
we got it. We didn't do that bad 25 to 54. What the hell are you talking about?

[00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:15.000]
Renere estate about the same 6 5 was 6 3. I had an 8 6, which is not chopped liver. Alex went

[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.580]
up in the afternoon and we found one demographic where he went up a little bit. What does that mean?

[00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:24.520]
Is he still leaving? Pretty good. Then why can't we say something? Okay, I mean, this audience

[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:29.660]
of this radio station has been jerked around so much the last five or six months and they're just

[00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:35.220]
they can't handle it. They don't know they got to have a scorecard. It's like the draft yesterday.

[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.680]
We had what 2000 people there. That's our cue. That's the whole audience of the station. Was

[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:44.300]
there for the draft? Boy, they're in their office right now. Oh, can't we tell football? When

[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:50.720]
this football start? Can we play some extra games? Miami, Dave County, wherever the how you are.

[00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:55.480]
Hi, Neil. Yes, sir. Mr. G here. Hey, how you doing? G good. Good to hear your voice.

[00:24:55.740 --> 00:25:00.640]
I'll bet. Hey, listen, I just want to thank Alex for letting us bash him. That was really nice of

[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:05.700]
him. He finally stood up and took it like a man. Really? Yes. He didn't handle it too well,

[00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:09.480]
but at least he let us. That's what freeway and spigots said too, but that's another story.

[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:13.500]
How about them? Cubbies. Yeah, they're struggling. But last year we were 7 and 9,

[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:17.980]
the first 16 games. Now we're 6 and 7. So, you know, you know, who I saw the way after getting

[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:23.080]
some good pitching. We just started hitting the ball. Yeah, I saw Ron Santo. Yeah, he's doing the radio

[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:28.900]
now. Bernie Banks. Uh huh. Louis up ratio. Oh, here we go. John Kissinger. Yeah. Fergie Jenkins. Uh huh.

[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:35.520]
Neil Rogers. Yep. All great men. Yeah. And Wayne Fontana and the mindbenders. Say hi to the guys.

[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:42.180]
Okay. See you. Bye. Boy, he's good. Any? It's 1127 at WIO Dean. We have an opening in Dave

[00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:49.400]
County. The book is a death knell WIO D from a 5 1 to a 3 8 were finished. You'll be hearing

[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:53.620]
Hungarian masierkas tomorrow morning starting at 6 a.m. In fact, they're looking at their

[00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:57.200]
carding them up right now. They're carding up the music. Well, it's been a lot of fun.

[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:01.300]
Been a year and a half for me. You know, I figured I'd come back one day after my illness and,

[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:06.520]
you know, say goodbye. Good day to come back. Yeah, it was. Oh, this is this will really put me

[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:09.920]
to this frame. I can be out of month now. Tell me I had a relapse from the numbers.

[00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:17.400]
Uh, what's Boka? Welcome back Neil. Thank you. Okay. Yes. I've got a story about Harry

[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:22.740]
returning to work after his stroke. Oh, he was out a long time. Well, and it goes back to 76

[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:27.380]
when he was the white socks announcer. He used to sing take me out to the bowl game to Jimmy

[00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:32.760]
Pierfell. Yeah. And Bill Vec put a public address microphone in the booth. I know the story. He's

[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:37.400]
told it a good times. Yeah. Okay. Well, I know. Bill Vec got him started doing it with a crowd.

[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:42.960]
Right. And when he came back when he went to the cubs, the everybody started cheering Harry,

[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:47.220]
Harry, and then the cubs came out of their dugout and then the reds came out and he said he was

[00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:54.960]
really moved by it. Really great. Hmm. Well, he also says, let's get some runs. And you know what?

[00:26:55.320 --> 00:27:05.100]
They don't. Yeah. Love a hill. Oh, one, two, three. Later. So what else?

[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:10.020]
I agree with you exactly what you said about the Met's weaknesses. Oh, man, they are.

[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:14.140]
They're pathetic. Really? The game. What did you see the game when the cubs won eight to six and

[00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:19.520]
thirteen innings? No, I don't know. And I mean, the Met's had that game won so many times.

[00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:23.720]
And Mitch Williams just pulled it out of his somewhere. I couldn't believe it. I kept

[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:27.440]
getting raised. Say, okay, that's it. I was kept getting up to turn the set off and go to bed.

[00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:32.620]
Huh? And he kept getting the third out. I just can't believe it. And they are defensively

[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:36.440]
so bad. And they're, you know, you can't complain about the throwing arms because they don't

[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:41.340]
have any. They can't throw anybody out. Twenty-one. Joerardy stole a base against the Met's. I

[00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:46.440]
couldn't believe it. My grandmother runs faster than Joerardy. And she's dead. Yeah, Jimmy Purysok

[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:51.360]
could run backwards and steal. Yeah. That's right. No, everybody talks about the six. And they even

[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:57.200]
pitched out one player and they still couldn't throw the guy out. It's not fair. It's pathetic. There,

[00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:02.260]
they are. But they got, you know, Viola's pitching fantastic and good and looks like he's coming around.

[00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:06.400]
But basically that who pitched yesterday for nine days, he pitched the good game yesterday. But

[00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:11.580]
their middle relief is a disaster. And Franco, I got news for you since they kicked him out of

[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:16.980]
Spain. He's never been the same. Well, this might cheer you up. It's going to be a long, it's going

[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:20.720]
to be just like it is now all year long. It's going to be over. That division is really weak.

[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:26.620]
And you've got your problems, right? Well, Don Zimmer had his problems in 1982 when he was with

[00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:29.600]
Texas. Can I ask you a question? What does this have to do with Harry's stroke?

[00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:36.120]
Oh, I just brought that up because when he came back, the fans were cheering for him before

[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:40.140]
the seventh inning. Oh, yeah. And they gave him, and the president called him up. Yeah.

[00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:43.460]
Welcome back. Dutch. Yeah. Yeah. Dutch. Yeah. Screw him.

[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:49.820]
All right. Just want to wish you well. Okay. Thanks. Okay. Yeah. 1130. W.I. did. We really

[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:57.260]
got a roller now. Don't we? Well, you guys won't tell me at the end. The audience is the same way.

[00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:03.020]
I mean, I know that some of you people are, we're listening last Thursday, which evidently was the

[00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:08.120]
pivotal day in the history of this radio station. And you won't tell me what the hell I went on.

[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:12.620]
You don't know. That's that. That was a three o'clock. He came back to his senses and blames on

[00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:19.880]
food poisoning. And that was it. Blamed what? Get that show? The two to three hour. And how about all

[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:24.620]
the other days? I think he was just concerned with the two to three. Oh, four lottery.

[00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:30.500]
Nail. Yeah. Hey, I'm known as Hurricane Man. How you doing? Okay. But by home.

[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:35.260]
By everyone from the dances. I'm friends of your dances.

[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:45.540]
Oh, great. You know, blue slippers. Yeah. Big guys. Uh-huh. The big guy. And I've got your favorite

[00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:50.900]
person on the phone. Can you can you sing Tena Tena? I got your friend Finkelson on the line.

[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:54.340]
What do you mean you got him on the line? Michael Michaels right on my

[00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:58.720]
line. Well, that's wonderful. Okay, Mike. You're a great guy. But enough is, you know, okay. Yeah,

[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:02.360]
I don't want to hear about Pompano Park. Last week or anything. Yeah. Good.

[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:08.400]
Okay. Good luck. I'm glad you're back on the air. Yeah. I'm glad you're back. I was worried about you.

[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:14.880]
Yeah. I bet. The handle is down 10% since I'm out. Still another week left. Yeah. Good. Have a good

[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:19.300]
time. Okay. They had a Ron Waples and all my friends up there. I see Donald Brainer to

[00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:23.880]
want to race. I got him. I had a relapse. Okay. That's why I didn't come back last Monday. So

[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:29.160]
that in the paper had sent me back a week. Okay. Okay. Hey, Kim. Say hi to your dad. Tell him, uh,

[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:35.440]
don't smoke too many cigarettes. Okay. All right. It's 1132 at W.I. Would do well. I can't

[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:41.420]
all be great. South Dave. You're the best. I know. It's so good to have you back. I can't tell you

[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:46.220]
what is this like a little love letter on the phone. Boy. Well, see, I worked the next day over

[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:50.480]
the weekend so I could have today off just a little. No, you didn't. I swear. And what if I

[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:54.300]
wouldn't have come back? Well, they said that you're going to be fired your ass. I just said I was

[00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:58.220]
going to be back last week too. And I couldn't make it. I was too sick. No, everybody knew they're

[00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:02.180]
going to say that just to have you just to get everybody to listen to me. No, I was planning on

[00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:07.040]
coming back and I had no energy. No, we wanted to give you an extra week. I had faith. These halls

[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:12.720]
meant to look to start with vitamin. Thie. They're the best. They are. They're good. So I heard what

[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:18.040]
happened Thursday. What happened? You ready for the truth? Yeah. About time. It all took an hour and a half.

[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:24.460]
Well, I didn't. Yeah. That's how long I was at home. Yeah. So hold this. Go ahead, sir. Okay.

[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:29.980]
You know, he went crazy and then he realized he was getting you know, over his head, Alex. So then

[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:35.940]
he went somewhere. He stepped into this building. He was getting you over his head. Okay. I got you.

[00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:40.540]
When he sat down behind the microphone for the first time, he was getting you know, over his head.

[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:46.320]
Oh, is he coming back? Go ahead. Well, you know, after he realized he was in over his head, he said

[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:51.160]
that it was the reason that he acted that way was because he gets no support from the radio station

[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:56.960]
and he doesn't feel right being there. And that's the reason he got no support on what he didn't.

[00:31:57.020 --> 00:32:01.140]
He said he had food poisoning. That was poor. Let me tell you something. What that's what he said.

[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:05.620]
Well, let me tell you something. We guys have been here two and a half months. Every time a pigeon flies

[00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:11.360]
over the building and lets one go. He threatens to walk out. Now he's got no numbers. He's got no

[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:15.800]
track work. He's got nothing, you know, nothing to base that on. I mean, if you're going to threaten

[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:20.180]
people, you've got to have something to hold over their head, which I used to have kill his book came

[00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:24.840]
out. After he's now going to be like, please, let me stay here. You know, well, he said to you know,

[00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:29.300]
on the air, he said that, you know, he could really walk out because they had to have under contract and

[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:33.700]
make it come after him and soon. But everybody knew that was going to be. But didn't he also say

[00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:38.300]
the week before that he never signed the contract? Didn't he say the day that he was going to get

[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:42.320]
on the plane because they wouldn't let him have alcohol. Steen on. He was quitting and that he hadn't

[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:46.340]
signed the contract yet. Oh, he says, you know, every day he says he's leaving. But

[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:53.640]
guess what? Well, I wouldn't be surprised. I think he is because I think Rick and Sputts

[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:58.900]
did such a good job last week. They opened their eyes. Uh-huh. And ears. And ears. Yeah. That's right.

[00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:02.140]
Got on those. What else? Well, I'm on the Rick and Sputts bandwagon now.

[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:07.460]
Bless you, sir. Rick. Excellent. But they're going to be a great compliment to this show.

[00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:11.540]
What's your last name again, Rick? Riley. Yes, sir. Okay. Like the life of Riley with William

[00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:15.740]
Bendix. We'll be hearing it on IOD. He was in the Babe Ruth story and hit that home run into the

[00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:21.040]
lower deck in Yankee Stadium on the first take. The kid died recently, you know. You know, what's

[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:26.340]
been your? No, not on the life of Riley went on Babe Ruth, who he allegedly hit the home run for

[00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:34.440]
that kid. Oh, he died. Charlie Ruth as in route. Okay. Yeah. Well, thanks a lot, sir. You're

[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:42.280]
finally strained us out. All right. One for Ali. Okay. One for the Gipper. It's 1135 at WID. Okay.

[00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:45.760]
I we had a little slip of the tongue there, a little slip of the copy on that, uh,

[00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:50.820]
CD in a cassette at specs. They're like 50 bits on there, not 10 or 12. Where do they come up with that?

[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:57.180]
Yeah. Is that Mike on? No. Yeah. He's even good with the mic off, you know. If you spoke

[00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:01.240]
once in a while, you'd be amazed. You could get like a two. And then with his two, you'd have a four.

[00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:07.020]
Oh, we got a celebrity collar on here now. Hi, Uncle Neil. Welcome back, buddy. Oh,

[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:16.180]
Gilbert, would you please set up? I thought if you I said hello to you this morning on the way to

[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:21.180]
work. How about that? You said hello to me on the way to work. Yeah. Remember that? I thought

[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:27.820]
probably you were listening. But anyway, what was this? You know, this morning on what show was that?

[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:32.360]
No, you know, if Randy Martin might know, I listen to Mike Riner. No, I the only reason I

[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:36.320]
listened over there was Bill Calder was there. I don't listen to Randy Mark. I'm sure she's a

[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:43.460]
very nice young lady, but I listened to the Mike Riner show on 610 W I O D 530 to 10 a.m. I know.

[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:51.460]
I I I featuring Henry Barrows cooking report. Okay, I listened to him too, but anyway, she told me to say hello to

[00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:56.400]
you and I'm very happy that you know she's very nice. He bill had nothing but nice things to say about her.

[00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:01.140]
Not such nice things about management like the program director. What's his name over there?

[00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:06.840]
Steve Brady. No, no, no, not the program director. The operations manager, whatever.

[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:15.860]
Bob McKay. Yeah. Dooshbag. I say. Dooshbag. And I hear the guy sicker than hell and they send him a

[00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:21.840]
certified letter saying, well, since you can't come back, adios, you know, that that would have been

[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:26.060]
like by having the stroke sitting there at home trying to recuperate with no energy. And there comes

[00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:31.360]
a knock at the door and it's a certified letter from W I O D saying, well, we wish you well, get

[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:35.220]
better and the goodbye. Was he not going to come back? You think Alice is going to get a certified

[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:41.880]
letter? I hope not. Oh, they're going to tell him face to face. Yeah, by the way, we listen.

[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:46.000]
Gilbert, let me ask you a question. What do you hear about Alex Bennett? Is he coming back?

[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:52.280]
Yeah, you know, he's probably went to San Francisco. I can't for a long weekend. Yeah, like he

[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:58.560]
he always say, I'm by the way, I said how lucky when I was at choice remote. You know, I've been saying

[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:02.500]
low to me everywhere. Good. I think I haven't heard it, you know. Yeah, did you hear that Friday

[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:06.680]
after? That's why I got better. No, I sure I haven't. Gilbert, have you been listening to me?

[00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:12.600]
Yes, sir. Since when? Well, before when I have spoke to you last, because I know, no, I

[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:19.560]
think you know, you're in the hospital. How about today? How about today? Yes, I was starting at

[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:25.340]
what time? Read my, read my list. Read the bar of soap that's going down my esophagus.

[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:31.680]
I know, but I was really thinking when I had a big fill and you applied my car on the hotel.

[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:36.580]
I enter. Are we having two conversations? Are you listening to me? Yes. What time did you turn

[00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:42.080]
the show on today? At 10.05 this morning. And what did I say that I say I have not listened to the

[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:46.980]
radio once since I've been sick? Yes, that's true. Until coming to work this morning, I turned on

[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:51.060]
Mike and listened all the way in and that's that's it. I haven't been listening. So I couldn't have

[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:57.180]
heard you with Joey or with any of these other fakers. I know, but I'm not. I'm not. I'm not.

[00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:00.960]
They're all nice. They're all great. Some of our unemployed, but some of our great. Oh, and of course

[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:04.260]
Craig were then called me several times. Craig is a good friend. I don't want to leave him out of

[00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:10.100]
my list. Yeah, Craig. Don't you, Gilbert? Yes, I know. And you know who told me who said to you.

[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:14.340]
Oh, and then speaking of that, Craig, I heard I don't want to say Craig told me because that would be,

[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:20.240]
you know, spilling the beans, but Paul Lyle, who's got to be one of the big douchebags of all time,

[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:24.860]
is running around at FTL a few days after I would go into the hospital telling people,

[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:30.480]
all I spoke to Neil on Friday. It wasn't a stroke and about my beep. I've never spoken to Paul

[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:35.020]
Lyle in my life. If he walked in the door right now, I wouldn't know him. I might kick his teeth

[00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:39.680]
down as God damn throat, but I wouldn't know him. And Paul, what the hell are you talking about, man?

[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:45.800]
I just another radio big mouth. I spoke from last week. Well, Callamy said douchebag, Gilbert.

[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:50.980]
Yeah, but I tell him he bites the big one. You know, I think a big grain of Melbourne is listening.

[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:56.180]
I would like to come down to the production room and make a recording. You know, there's no chance, Gilbert.

[00:37:56.180 --> 00:38:01.560]
No chance. No chance. Wait, let me, I think I'm getting my strength back and took this call to do it.

[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:05.920]
All right, you know, like take me off the block. Are they, are they sitting shivvy in the conference room

[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:09.040]
for this book today, boy? They're all, oh, what are we going to do?

[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:16.060]
Hey, listen, it did drop this station, dropped like a rock from the top of the Empire State Building.

[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:18.580]
Well, you know, I hope they would promote this station up.

[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:21.540]
And over in Lakeland, the bird is saying, see, I left that back.

[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:25.480]
That's true. Yeah, that had a lot to do with it. Didn't it, Gilbert?

[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:30.080]
Yes, it did. Yeah. Thank you. Well, listen, on that note, have a nice day.

[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:36.200]
Okay. Thank you. Say hi to Joey. Okay. Bye. Oh, God. Take care, everybody.

[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:40.760]
Did you hear that at the end to his public? The man is out of control.

[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:43.500]
What's nice to see the things have changed a lot since I was sick?

[00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:48.320]
1143, we have an open line in day. No, we don't. Why am I button giving the numbers out?

[00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:51.040]
See, I got to get used to that because a couple of days, this will wear off.

[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:54.500]
It'll be right back to the same old, you know, symbol, bitching,

[00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:57.400]
same old, right? No eating, though, no more food.

[00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:02.040]
The staff will not be quite as friendly in a few days when they decide there

[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:06.100]
no food coming in this joy. None. None. Zero.

[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.860]
And no matter how many times I said that before, meaning erase all of that from the chalkboard.

[00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:16.540]
Okay. None. In fact, I've discovered that I can't even eat breakfast.

[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.640]
I take my medication in the morning, I eat the breakfast and my blood sugar.

[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:26.460]
In fact, when I get up in the morning, my blood sugar goes up automatically without eating anything.

[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:31.060]
Even if I take the medication that goes up dramatically, not to a unsafe level,

[00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:33.060]
but it goes well and then it starts coming down again.

[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:36.320]
No, I don't understand. Is that good or bad? I don't know. I'll find out.

[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.780]
But see, that's one of the good things about my having that time off is you kind of experiment

[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:43.820]
and you keep track of the readings and you stick yourself with the, you know,

[00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:46.640]
in a finger's 10 million times, that doesn't look too appetizing.

[00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:48.800]
No, you can't see it from take the glasses off.

[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:52.060]
They give you some kind of a device to do that or no, you have to take it.

[00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:53.920]
You stick Alex's teeth in your finger.

[00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:59.280]
Okay, smart ass. Do they, you know, you take a pairing knife.

[00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:06.040]
You're taking all AWL and you stick it in your hand.

[00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:11.560]
Okay, and the blood gushes out and you grab a drop and you stick it on your little thing there.

[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:14.060]
Okay, that's the way I would have done it. I guess okay. Yeah.

[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:15.320]
Now, what do they call them? Puts.

[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:19.500]
Champagne Lou. You stick your knife and your little thing and blood gushes out.

[00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:22.200]
Exactly. Let me tell you. You guys are maniac.

[00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:23.760]
You scared the hell out of me.

[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:26.020]
Why is that? Well, you better lose it.

[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:28.320]
What happened to you? You better lose some weight, sir.

[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:32.540]
I stopped eating. Well, good for you because I can't pull mother nature, my friend.

[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:37.080]
I was in a panic. Yeah. I say, go on my money and bet champagne for Ashley and the woods.

[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:39.680]
Yeah, while she's a, he's still a desperate third.

[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:41.000]
I come home. That's your third.

[00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:43.480]
I'm serious note. Thank God you are all right.

[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:45.160]
I'm okay. I guess.

[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.140]
We're from this big guy.

[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:47.840]
Well, thank you. Almost big guy.

[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:48.740]
All the fat guys.

[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:50.940]
Have a good day.

[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:55.020]
Okay, Lou. Thank you. Boy, he was probably one of our two McDonald's.

[00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:58.380]
1145 at WIOD and let's take a call.

[00:40:58.600 --> 00:40:59.840]
He was on a mobile. Not exciting.

[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.280]
Here's a lady in Pomano.

[00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:03.060]
I think.

[00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:04.280]
Hello. Hi.

[00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:05.420]
Hi. Hi. Hi, Mia.

[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:06.100]
How you doing?

[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:07.420]
God, I'm glad you're okay.

[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:08.180]
Thank you.

[00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:12.820]
You are the only radio top show person I've ever listened to in my life.

[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:13.880]
Well, thank God for you.

[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:15.160]
I can believe when you aren't there.

[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:19.400]
And if Rachel would get up out of the chair, we can see the 25 to 54 numbers

[00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:21.740]
and find out if there were any women listening.

[00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:23.100]
I'm 31.

[00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:24.900]
No, I don't mean you. Oh, that's great.

[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:25.840]
Perfect.

[00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:26.480]
Perfect demographic.

[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:27.840]
I think a lot of us just don't call.

[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:30.380]
I think a lot of people are bringing Bill Smith and Sandy back.

[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:32.200]
We want that 90 year old audience, man.

[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.780]
We want the audience that snoozes all day.

[00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:37.320]
I thought you'd build a word.

[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:40.320]
And it really doesn't do you justice at all.

[00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:43.100]
This is our second report on the billboard.

[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.440]
And they say, Nish, good.

[00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:45.460]
Nish, good.

[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:48.120]
Is one I hear in Pomano just not far from my house.

[00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:48.600]
Where is it?

[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:51.480]
It's like a sketch, but it's a poorly done sketch.

[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:52.440]
Where is it?

[00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:55.640]
Gosh, I really couldn't.

[00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:57.980]
I was looking for a place to eat yesterday that wasn't crowded.

[00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.800]
So it's like all over Pomano.

[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:01.480]
So I really couldn't tell you exactly.

[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:04.580]
But it's it's a northeast Pomano.

[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:06.480]
Yeah, I guess.

[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:10.040]
But anyway, why I called originally was to ask you.

[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:12.820]
You used to talk about days of our lives.

[00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:13.180]

[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:15.380]
Did it happen to catch it last week when you were home?

[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:16.400]
No, I don't want you anymore.

[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:17.260]
I, uh...

[00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:18.740]
Peter Racco's back as Bo.

[00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:19.660]
Oh, I know that.

[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:21.240]
I came across it for like a minute.

[00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:25.220]
But once you get away from a soap opera for a couple of years or longer,

[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:27.060]
everybody's gone.

[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:29.920]
Even guiding light I caught once in a great while.

[00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:33.240]
And the fact that Roger's back maybe almost have a relapse.

[00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:34.600]
So I can't handle it.

[00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:35.320]
Too much stress.

[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:37.280]
Even Julie's back, Peter, on that.

[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:38.040]
Did you have me catch that?

[00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:39.000]
I mean, it's incredible.

[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:40.120]
All the old people.

[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:40.880]
Like I've watched it.

[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:41.960]
Well, maybe they're rising up.

[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:42.560]
Twelve.

[00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:45.100]
Yeah, some of them even come back to life.

[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:48.620]
I just I wondered if you saw him come back onto the to the

[00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:51.340]
waiting wait till Papa Bauer comes back on guiding light.

[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:52.140]
That's going to make news.

[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:53.640]
Even Channel 6 will have that on.

[00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:57.480]
You were never really happy with the patch situation.

[00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:58.560]
You know, patch guys.

[00:42:58.560 --> 00:42:59.740]
Oh, they were always fighting.

[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.500]
Exactly the way he came back onto the show.

[00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:05.040]
Walked into a bar and patches getting beat up.

[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:06.580]
So he there they were.

[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:08.580]
Well, are they bringing back Doug and Julie?

[00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:10.260]
Julie's back.

[00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:12.500]
She got back like a month ago.

[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:12.900]
Really?

[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.320]
I don't know about the other one.

[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:15.060]
How about David?

[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:16.080]
No.

[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:17.860]
Well, I'm not watching them.

[00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:19.580]
Scott, the son, David's son.

[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:19.980]
Scott.

[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:22.020]
David's son.

[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:25.600]
Yeah, Scott banning somehow they say that he's Julie's grandson,

[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:26.900]
but I thought he was her son.

[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:31.200]
Well, only the gynecologist was for sure.

[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:31.340]
Right.

[00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:31.640]
Really?

[00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:35.760]
Anyway, it's great to hear you back and and I'm glad I have something to do

[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:36.620]
from 10 to 2 now.

[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:37.180]
Thank you.

[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:39.060]
You have a nice day.

[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:39.520]
You too.

[00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:42.840]
Please stay away from those bad foods and all that horrible stuff.

[00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:43.460]
Trust me.

[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.600]
I won't call you again probably unless I hear you eating on the air.

[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:51.120]
The only thing that will go in my mouth beside my required diet food will be that barisope.

[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:52.580]
I'm taping the show today.

[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:55.480]
So if I hear you eating on it, I'm going to call up and play you a car.

[00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:56.160]
No chance.

[00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:57.420]
No chance.

[00:43:58.020 --> 00:43:58.620]
See you later.

[00:43:58.760 --> 00:43:59.360]
Take care.

[00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:01.140]
Okay, it's 12 till noon.

[00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:03.000]
The people from Channel 6 are here.

[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:03.660]
This is exciting.

[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:04.220]
Is this news?

[00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:05.700]
Must be a slow day today, boy.

[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:07.080]
Must be desperate.

[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:10.400]
But I do want to thank say thank you to Barbara Sloan.

[00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:11.320]
She is such a nice person.

[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:13.180]
She sent me the most beautiful plant.

[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:14.980]
Will is it Easterly?

[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:16.040]
Is it with a white thing?

[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:17.760]
You know, a big gorgeous.

[00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:18.720]
She is so nice.

[00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:19.220]
It's frightening.

[00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:20.340]
You know, it's incredible.

[00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:22.540]
Anyway, oh boy.

[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:24.700]
Here we go with the food again where you can't get away from it.

[00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:25.580]
I can't eat it right now.

[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:26.600]
Okay, it's 11.52.

[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:29.540]
Boy, this book is a death knell.

[00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:30.600]
Death knell.

[00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:32.500]
Bring in the Hungarian maszerkas.

[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.240]
Boy, are they psychotic in the building?

[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.140]
Are they blowing their brains out?

[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:37.280]
Too bad.

[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:40.920]
Anyway, it's nice to see that the brain trust in our programming

[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:42.760]
department has really got us on the right track.

[00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:44.400]
Let's take a call from Kendall.

[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:44.740]
Hello.

[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:45.700]
Neil.

[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:46.160]
Yeah.

[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:47.020]
Welcome back.

[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:47.520]
Hey.

[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:47.900]
Hey.

[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:48.580]
Thank you.

[00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:49.580]
Let me tell you something.

[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:53.120]
I never thought I would be so addicted to a radio show that I would go

[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:55.960]
nuts when the host was off the air for a couple of weeks.

[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:56.780]
You want nuts?

[00:44:57.220 --> 00:45:01.340]
Nuts, well, I think nuts might not be the operative term here, but, uh,

[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:04.160]
well, from what I'm hearing, there were a lot of people around here going nuts too.

[00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:06.780]
Yeah, well, let me tell you, Rick and Bud sir, are they still in there?

[00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:08.280]
No, they're well, one of them.

[00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:08.900]
Well, kind of.

[00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:11.720]
Yeah, well, let me tell you, they did an excellent job.

[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:12.660]
That's what I heard.

[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:13.300]
They did, didn't they?

[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:17.580]
Nothing like the real host, but you know, you know, as as a feeling, they did.

[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:18.000]

[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:18.480]
Yeah.

[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:21.160]
Okay, I guess they'll be on from two to six now here.

[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:22.340]
I wouldn't be surprised.

[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:23.740]
Well, I wouldn't be surprised.

[00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:24.800]
I wanted to say that.

[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:26.340]
Well, he's out of the room now.

[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:28.500]
Why did you just go ahead and tell him what's that?

[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:30.020]
He won't, he won't say anything.

[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:30.420]
No, who?

[00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:30.680]
Rick?

[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:31.420]
Put it out.

[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:32.660]
Rick, they were out of your okay.

[00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:34.660]
Come on, I won't even tell him that you said it.

[00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:36.000]
There's nothing to tell.

[00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:36.760]
Yes, there is.

[00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:38.080]
You just can't say it.

[00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:39.180]
They're all right.

[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:40.240]
Let me ask you this question.

[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.700]
Is there something to tell, but you can't say it?

[00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:44.880]
No, I'm asking him.

[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:45.440]
Oh, okay.

[00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:49.580]
See, then you don't have to say, I won't, I won't ask a follow-up question.

[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:50.300]
That's the question.

[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:53.000]
There is there something to tell, but you can't say.

[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:53.440]
Yes.

[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:54.100]
See?

[00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:55.860]
Well, they start Wednesday.

[00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:57.220]
I don't think really.

[00:45:57.460 --> 00:45:58.880]
Well, I'll be listening in.

[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:02.740]
I was kind of hoping for Stan to get to the six, but we know what happened.

[00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:03.640]
And you know what they're going to say?

[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:04.780]
They're going to say, oh, look at that.

[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:06.960]
Been a win up 25 to 54.

[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:08.300]
Men and women a little bit there.

[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:09.700]
Let's not be so hasty.

[00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:14.260]
You know, for you know, it looks like that decision to go with his.

[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:16.760]
But anyway, let me, I just want to.

[00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:20.080]
I mean, from what I understand, because nobody will tell me exactly what

[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:22.300]
happening evidently came totally unraveled.

[00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:22.940]
Oh, yeah, he did.

[00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:25.740]
I don't know what kind of environment he was used to, but he sure wasn't

[00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:27.020]
prepared to work in this market.

[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:27.660]
I'll tell you that.

[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.660]
They were ripping him to bits.

[00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:31.700]
Let me tell you, I thought he was crying on the air.

[00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:34.580]
Believe it or not, I thought he was going to break into tears, but I don't know.

[00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:36.280]
Let's face it, the show sucked.

[00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:40.860]
Well, now that I know that he's not coming back, he, well, he used to say that you,

[00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:42.860]
he was that you were behind them all the way.

[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.000]
I know, Niels, behind me.

[00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:45.640]
Because I had to be behind him.

[00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:47.360]
I mean, we're, you know, we're a team here, you know,

[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:48.360]
when together, lose to you.

[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:49.660]
Like the Cubs and the Mets.

[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:50.920]
Well, like the Reds.

[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.140]
Hey, I'd like to be up.

[00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:52.960]
Yeah, how about him?

[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.020]
Hey, that's my team, Niels.

[00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:56.360]
You know, they've been selling dwellers for the last couple of years.

[00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:58.460]
So, you know, you got to be, you got to take what you can get.

[00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:00.800]
Okay, but like Pete Rose said, don't bet on it.

[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:03.280]
Yeah, well, uh, including Niels.

[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:06.260]
Uh, he turned out to be a real credit to the sport, didn't he?

[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:07.060]
Who, Pete Rose?

[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:08.140]
Little incompatible.

[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:08.360]
Yeah, I agree.

[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:09.580]
Never stole a freight train.

[00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:10.440]
Nettin' right.

[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:11.500]
Never stole a freight train.

[00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:11.880]
That's the right.

[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:12.560]
He'll be on Donnie.

[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:13.180]
I'm next with you.

[00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:14.500]
Say, hey, everything's okay.

[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:15.420]
He's a good guy, you know?

[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:16.500]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:19.240]
It sounds boring, but I just, I had to say welcome back.

[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:19.540]
Yeah.

[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:20.800]
And tell you that I missed you.

[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:22.000]
Well, it'll be nice today.

[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:22.720]
I want it then tomorrow.

[00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:23.140]
They'll be right.

[00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:24.800]
I think they'll they'll nell out, you know?

[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.700]
We kill the whole Monday doing this today.

[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:28.300]
Thank God I came back on a Monday.

[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:29.880]
You want to know?

[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:31.320]
There'll be three calls right now.

[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:34.140]
Yeah, you want to know what really happened on what this, this,

[00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:34.660]
this, this, this, this thing.

[00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:37.400]
It's about time we find somebody in the honor, in the audience,

[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:40.480]
with enough honesty and courage to tell me I can handle it.

[00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:41.020]
What happened?

[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:43.280]
I think that the thing really started on a Monday,

[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:45.200]
because there was, there was a show that they did.

[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:48.540]
They started out on a Monday, and they got a couple of calls from people

[00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:51.500]
that were for bashing Alex, and they just said they didn't like Alex,

[00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:52.980]
or what they really said was Alex.

[00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:53.380]
It sucks.

[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:54.140]
The caller.

[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:54.720]
And it's right.

[00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:57.480]
And so it wasn't really on the part of the host.

[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:00.120]
And then on Tuesday, they said that off the ear, though.

[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:03.180]
No, they, they, well, yeah, but that's on it.

[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:06.660]
And then on Tuesday, Alex came in at about like one o'clock,

[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:09.620]
and right after the news came back, all you heard was that little thing

[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:12.920]
that you had taped there where they said, um, if you guys say,

[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:16.340]
if these people come back in the studio, I'm leaving or something or other.

[00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:20.900]
And so it's Rick and Spud declared a no talk on Alex.

[00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:24.280]
He said, anybody who calls up, it says anything bad or good about Alex

[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:26.620]
is getting hung up on, and you're not going to make it on the air.

[00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:28.240]
We have no guess today.

[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:30.680]
How did this happen?

[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:31.940]
I'm going home.

[00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:37.720]
Yeah.

[00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:39.960]
So he hung up on all the calls.

[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:42.980]
The people would go like right through a call and then they try to at the end

[00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:45.360]
get in something about Alex, you know, like they're trying to be slick.

[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:47.900]
And he dumped them and they, they wouldn't make it on the air.

[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:48.320]
All right.

[00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:50.220]
Can I point something out to you in the audience?

[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:54.800]
In spite of these little fluctuations here, because, you know,

[00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:55.900]
I don't know what the hell it is.

[00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:59.900]
But the bottom line is, there are 90% of the audience

[00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:01.300]
hated him to begin with, okay?

[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:03.740]
Kane's audience is all gone.

[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:07.040]
So at this point, we have no Alex Bennett audience,

[00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:09.740]
and we have no Steve Kane audience, okay?

[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:11.540]
We got the micrinary audience.

[00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:12.980]
We got my audience.

[00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:15.680]
And then of course Stan has got like baseball on every night.

[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:17.760]
So that, you know, like a washout, that's it.

[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:20.460]
Our quam is like six people.

[00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:21.620]
So we got like what?

[00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:22.800]
WFTL listeners?

[00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:23.240]
Yeah.

[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:28.120]
If we keep going like this, they make, if they make three more changes,

[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:30.900]
WFTL will beat us in the next book.

[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:32.680]
So the one.

[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:37.360]
So the two to three hour on Thursday was just Alex Bennett's version.

[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:41.200]
If you remember talk radio, where Eric Bogosian went into that little loss of

[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:43.280]
reality thing where the room was spinning, you know,

[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:45.940]
and the lights went down and he didn't know what the hell he was doing.

[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:46.200]
Yeah.

[00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:50.540]
And this chain smoking cigarette, that was like what Alex went through on the two to three hour

[00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:51.080]
Thursday.

[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:51.600]
Great.

[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:53.820]
And it was just, you know, unbelievable.

[00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:55.840]
Okay Charles, you did a great job.

[00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:56.420]
Love your nail.

[00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:57.260]
Talk to you next month.

[00:49:57.420 --> 00:49:57.680]
Okay.

[00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:57.960]
Bye.

[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:00.180]
Anyway, that's it.

[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:01.780]
Boy, this is going by fast, didn't it?

[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:02.520]
Sure is.

[00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:03.180]
Did every day.

[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:03.860]
Yeah.

[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:05.160]
Easy for you to say.

[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:33.040]
Anyway, we've got Deborah Martinez who I understand is going to the big time.

[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:46.680]
Okay.

[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:55.360]
Okay.

[00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:56.240]
Okay.

[00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:56.920]
Okay.

[00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:57.360]
Ron.

[00:50:57.560 --> 00:50:58.760]
Ron, Shane John.

[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:00.440]
Twelve oh seven.

[00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:03.020]
And I want to send this out to Rick Rally who's going to be the first to be the first

[00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:07.700]
still looking for his degree of a Bill Wayne School of Broadcasting out in Hollywood.

[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:17.940]
Okay.

[00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:18.560]
Hold on, Ron.

[00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:19.000]
Week.

[00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:19.720]
Very week.

[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:20.720]
Out of practice.

[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:28.120]
Anyway, thanks to Robert and Mark at Sports Card Heaven up in Davey for the, whatever the

[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:28.460]
hell it is.

[00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:31.840]
It's a Cubs Cup mug.

[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:32.440]
Right?

[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:34.860]
And it's got stuff in it.

[00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:35.580]
It's a slubber.

[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:40.180]
Well, it's a tumbler, but it's like, what the hell do you call it?

[00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:43.960]
It's got a little bat in there which they could use at this point.

[00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:49.420]
And it's got fluorescent stuff in it, you know, in the sides of it, but you can still

[00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:50.180]
drink out of it, huh?

[00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:50.540]
Yeah.

[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:51.160]

[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:54.860]
And here's a Harry Carey coaster to put under the tumbler.

[00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:57.140]
And thanks a lot, guys.

[00:51:57.340 --> 00:51:58.340]
They're, they're good guys up there.

[00:51:58.560 --> 00:51:58.680]
Okay.

[00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:00.560]
I guess.

[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:03.300]
Anyway, it's 1208 and WIOD.

[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:05.580]
We had a death knell in the book and that's good.

[00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:09.460]
It's, it's, see, the audience feels more sympathy when you're under, you know, you can relate

[00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:09.820]
to that.

[00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:12.200]
Let's try Miami.

[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:12.640]
Hello.

[00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:13.540]
Hey, Neil.

[00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:14.600]
Good to have you back.

[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:15.240]
Thank you.

[00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:17.840]
Oh, I have an Alex Bennitz-Piperport.

[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:18.220]
Okay.

[00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:20.600]
Alex is not out of town.

[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:23.340]
He's out of his house.

[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:24.960]
How do you know that?

[00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:26.600]
Well, let's hear it.

[00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:26.980]
Are you outside?

[00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:30.180]
Are you with Tom Feedler now with the raincoat on looking in the window?

[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:33.840]
No, let's just have my ways and I-

[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:35.940]
Inspiring reporters at the Harold Wannano.

[00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:42.040]
I just tapped my ways and I found out that he's at home.

[00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:42.900]
Really?

[00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:43.940]
That's right.

[00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:45.640]
So he's listening right now?

[00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:47.080]
I don't, I don't know.

[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:48.380]
When I said where he shows sucks.

[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:50.260]
Well, I don't really care.

[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:52.300]
I know if he was thinking I just-

[00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:54.600]
I know how many of those stand-up comics can you bring on?

[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:55.240]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:52:55.660 --> 00:53:00.160]
About 15,000 of them have been on my mind.

[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:00.840]
I'm just gonna stand to that.

[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:03.120]
Hey, it's got his own four hours in there.

[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:06.460]
He's gonna stand up or fall down on his own nothing, you know?

[00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:07.200]
That's right.

[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:11.240]
Well, I just want to let you know that he is in town.

[00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:11.980]
Okay.

[00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:12.560]
Okay.

[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:13.520]
We've got it noted.

[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:14.140]
Okay.

[00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:14.780]
Thank you.

[00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:15.060]

[00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:16.460]
Excellent spy report.

[00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:17.680]
You can't pull us, Alex.

[00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:18.160]
Okay.

[00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:19.940]
Come out wherever you are.

[00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:24.300]
Well, would that be great if we got him in here during the one to two hour with Brick

[00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:24.780]
and Puts?

[00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:26.800]
I don't think so.

[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:27.180]
Huh?

[00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:28.240]
Oh, yeah.

[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:31.080]
Three out of four falls.

[00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:33.900]
Oh, let's go to plantation.

[00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:35.260]
Oh, go near.

[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:36.000]
Hi.

[00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:37.100]
Welcome back.

[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:37.940]
Thank you.

[00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:40.880]
It's so great to hear you sound great today.

[00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:43.300]
Yeah, do I feel a lot better when I first came in.

[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:44.560]
I was a little shaky, you know?

[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:46.080]
Yeah, you sound great.

[00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:47.620]
But now I feel great.

[00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:50.780]
Now that I've had my halls mental looked this vitamin C drop.

[00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:52.100]
Oh, great, great.

[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:52.660]
Yeah.

[00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:54.960]
So you still have your satellite this up?

[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:55.780]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:57.920]
Oh, that's more lucky.

[00:53:57.920 --> 00:53:59.520]
You never think a lot.

[00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:00.540]
Never leaving.

[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:04.620]
I thought about you and that 8 to 6 loss to the next.

[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:06.260]
No, they want 8 to 6.

[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:07.600]
Well, we lost.

[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:10.560]
Oh, I was thinking, well, you know, that may help you recover.

[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:11.440]
I loved it.

[00:54:11.620 --> 00:54:14.300]
I loved that throw by Hojo in the 13th inning.

[00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:19.080]
They had that game won and then I loved the next day when Marvel win hit that pinch hit

[00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:20.320]
triple with the bases loaded.

[00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:24.000]
It's just a pickup of where they left off last year.

[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:24.620]
Yeah.

[00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:26.660]
Well, we'll see.

[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:27.760]
It's going to be a long season.

[00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:31.340]
One thing about the Cubs is just like last year, they're starting out real good on the

[00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:31.540]
road.

[00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:35.960]
They're 4 and 2 on the road and they're 2 and 5 at Wrigley Field.

[00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:38.200]
Just like last year, they started out real bad at home.

[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:38.700]
Yeah.

[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:39.720]
Well, we got up there.

[00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:40.560]
Then we straightened them out.

[00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:41.460]
We'll have a good year.

[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:42.300]
Yeah.

[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:46.820]
Anyway, did you hit it so Alex, do I have to punch out the stand also?

[00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:49.120]
He's trying to punch out the stand?

[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:51.280]
Yeah, there was one night that stand came in.

[00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:52.820]
Well, you know, one thing I must say.

[00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:57.780]
And could you see that the management has got this place under total control while I

[00:54:57.780 --> 00:54:58.240]
was out?

[00:54:58.360 --> 00:54:59.640]
OK, I was concerned about that.

[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:04.120]
I was a little worried, but it's nice to know that they've got everything firmly under

[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:04.580]
control.

[00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:05.940]
We're going to leave stand alone.

[00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:07.320]
What the hell is this thing?

[00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:08.140]
What's stand now?

[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:09.880]
I love this one, though.

[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:10.860]
I've got a week to go.

[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:14.320]
See, he's hated stand ever since he got, I guess the thing with Alex is that anybody

[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:17.880]
who he thinks threatens his job, he hates.

[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:21.880]
You know, I try to give him a chance and I know several people have left.

[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:24.700]
But he's just a few of me's very good guys.

[00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:25.540]
Yeah, it really is.

[00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:26.280]
What's his problem?

[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:27.020]
I don't know.

[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:28.400]
I don't know.

[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:30.100]
He's a very bizarre guy.

[00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:34.060]
He just cannot, and it's not just me, but everybody else I've talked to and I've made

[00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:34.520]
the comment.

[00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:37.440]
They say, absolutely, you can't get close to the guy.

[00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:39.300]
You can't have a conversation with him.

[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:41.720]
He's like, I've just never encountered anybody.

[00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:46.080]
I mean, I don't dislike him or anything, but I've just never encountered anybody like

[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:46.940]
him in my life.

[00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:49.100]
He's just a very bizarre individual.

[00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:51.920]
I'd be confident if he takes it out on everybody around him.

[00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:55.940]
Yeah, well, I hope Rick and Sides get a chance because they really did an ad

[00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:56.220]
more.

[00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:57.640]
Yeah, they start Wednesday, I think.

[00:55:57.880 --> 00:55:58.860]
I think they start Wednesday.

[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:00.360]
Oh, that's great.

[00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:01.280]
Now I'm going to have to start.

[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:04.280]
They want to put, they want to put Joey on for a couple of days so that they'll look

[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:05.480]
real good by comparison.

[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.360]
Well, Rick and Sides are great.

[00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:09.760]
I hope they get a spot on the stage.

[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:10.420]
They got it.

[00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:10.900]
Trust me.

[00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:11.700]
Oh, great.

[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:12.400]
That's great.

[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:13.200]
You got to start the pasta.

[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:17.680]
And start running around telling everybody, listen to WIOD, we need some help here, man.

[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:19.420]
You got all the help from my here.

[00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:22.440]
Those billboards with that thing in my mouth, that's not going to do the job.

[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:24.180]
Have a great one.

[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:27.300]
Neil, take care and please don't ever do that for us again.

[00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:28.260]
We love you.

[00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:29.180]
Okay, well, listen to that.

[00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:29.920]
I got the book came out.

[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:30.880]
I can't afford to be out.

[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:31.780]
Stay well, Neil.

[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:32.160]
See you later.

[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:35.620]
It's a 13 past noon at WIOD.

[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:38.960]
Everybody at the hospital, by the way, plantation general, I send them greetings.

[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:39.860]
They were all listeners.

[00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:42.360]
And what can I say?

[00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:44.100]
Find hospital, isn't it?

[00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:44.480]
Yeah.

[00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:45.520]
Very nice people.

[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:47.120]
They don't know what they're doing, but it was a fine hospital.

[00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:49.520]
Anyway, we're talking about teeth before.

[00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:52.360]
While coming back wouldn't be complete without...

[00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:58.780]
He is still world's biggest asshole, Tom Denimer.

[00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:01.480]
Tom Denimer.

[00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:03.160]
Fuck it.

[00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:03.680]
Fuck it.

[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:04.120]
Guess what?

[00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:04.560]
Look at that.

[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:04.940]
Broward.

[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.420]
There's an open line in Broward now.

[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:07.340]
Oh, boy.

[00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:08.160]
Woo!

[00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:12.120]
1216 at WIOD, but we still got...

[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:13.120]
You got that, right, baby.

[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:15.980]
1216 at WIOD, your music way.

[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:17.920]
Ron St. John, cooking good.

[00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:23.620]
Even if I'm off for two weeks myself, Eric Kessu and Fapola Oopman.

[00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:26.140]
Weak talk up, Ron.

[00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:27.980]
That's all the most bad.

[00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:30.400]
OK, it's 1217, but that killed a good minute.

[00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:31.920]
Here's a mobile on the Palm Beach line.

[00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:32.280]
Hello.

[00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:34.680]
Neil, I'm at the point, baby.

[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:35.720]
Oh, my God.

[00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:36.500]
It's Lee, Jr.

[00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:37.800]
Absolutely.

[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:40.800]
Oh, there's that laugh.

[00:57:41.580 --> 00:57:43.360]
Neil, I'm glad you're finally back.

[00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:44.440]
I was running out of material.

[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:45.080]
Oh, but...

[00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:45.580]
Yeah.

[00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:51.280]
I'll tell you what, after the tailor made your last suit, he ran out of material, too, Lee.

[00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:52.700]
Better watch that diet.

[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:53.720]
OK.

[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:55.440]
Jeez.

[00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:56.480]
Don't rub it in.

[00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:02.360]
Listen, it may be you always would ask this, but starting Wednesday, I'm going to be

[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:05.060]
the permanent substitute host on the New Lick and Sud Show.

[00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:05.700]
Really?

[00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:08.620]
Well, that's what we needed some more changes around here, Lee.

[00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:10.360]
Listen, Neil.

[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:10.880]
Yeah.

[00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:11.740]
We need nothing.

[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:15.960]
As you can probably tell from the sound of my voice, I'm depressed.

[00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:19.460]
My girlfriend left me.

[00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:21.960]
She decided to finish junior high.

[00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:24.960]
Off the one father just approached him on a relationship.

[00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:29.460]
You know, I kept telling her, don't worry, when your dad is my angel, understand.

[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:32.240]
But really, seriously, no.

[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:35.520]
It might not be as bad as everyone said.

[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:36.520]
Absolutely.

[00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:40.380]
Listen, I heard my concert last week.

[00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:40.780]
I'll bet.

[00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:43.800]
I guess now Rick Shaw finally got his revenge.

[00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:46.700]
Did you hear about the special guest?

[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:50.260]
The special guest Rick Shaw had on the show?

[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:51.480]
No, Lee.

[00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:53.720]
He was that guy from Happy Days.

[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:55.300]
You know, Hanson Williams?

[00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:55.980]
Yeah.

[00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:57.860]
And he said, it's a lie.

[00:58:58.100 --> 00:58:59.300]
I am not a potsy.

[00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:03.140]
Oh, he's been working on these.

[00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:05.360]
He's been working on these for two and a half weeks.

[00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:06.260]
Absolutely.

[00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:07.560]
Yeah, I believe it.

[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:09.040]
Well, and closingly, yes.

[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:10.980]
I had a couple of jokes about how it's been.

[00:59:11.220 --> 00:59:13.780]
But I have played, he would trace my number in sumi.

[00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:14.140]
Yeah.

[00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:15.700]
That's his new thing now.

[00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:19.380]
He probably sumi for all these terrible for lack of support.

[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:20.760]
I don't know which is better.

[00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:22.060]
His skin on his hair.

[00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:26.020]
I've got more hair clogging my sink than he had but his head.

[00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:27.560]
Heeey.

[00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:28.460]
Well, Lee?

[00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:29.960]
Uh, yes.

[00:59:30.220 --> 00:59:31.100]
Save some of it.

[00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:33.760]
Don't you want to hear Debbie Ellis joke?

[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:35.060]
You'll need it.

[00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:36.200]
See, Lee?

[00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:38.820]
Oh, did I call one shabber only a douchebag?

[00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:39.500]
Twice.

[00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:41.100]
See, Lee.

[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:42.600]
1219 and W.I.O.D.

[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:43.600]
Boy, he's good, isn't he?

[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:44.640]
He's the best.

[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:45.260]
Did he call you?

[00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:47.260]
No, he wouldn't call you guys.

[00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:48.080]
Plantation.

[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:48.720]
Hello, Neil.

[00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:49.120]
Hi.

[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:50.920]
Thank God you're back.

[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:51.440]
Yeah.

[00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:53.100]
I thank the Lord for the night time.

[00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:55.040]
I have a file diamond on W.I.O.D.

[00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:56.900]
Our new format, Bob DeCarlo is coming back.

[00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:58.160]
I finally got.

[00:59:58.200 --> 00:59:59.620]
Easy hits all the time.

[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:03.740]
I finally got a taste of what life would have been like.

[01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:04.980]
I think that without Neil would be like.

[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:05.400]
Really?

[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:06.900]
And I didn't think I could handle it.

[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:09.020]
I could handle it for another couple of years.

[01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:09.740]
I bet you would.

[01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:09.960]
Yeah.

[01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:12.760]
If they were sent in the check over every week, I was kind of starting to get used to it.

[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:16.580]
I got worried when I read that article when you said, hey, life is more than a radio show.

[01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:17.180]
That's right.

[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.600]
Oh, my God, he's not coming back.

[01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:22.220]
No, but it's just that, you know, some people would call me, I mean, with good intentions,

[01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:23.940]
and they'd start talking about the business.

[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:25.440]
And did you hear this?

[01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:26.360]
And did you hear that?

[01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:32.340]
And I tried to explain to them in my own inept way that after something like this happens to you,

[01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:36.840]
you don't care about the radio show or the radio station.

[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:38.480]
I mean, you don't even think about those things.

[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:40.600]
You do everything you can to get your health back.

[01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:42.060]
Because you don't have your health.

[01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:43.280]
What the hell is all the rest of this?

[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:44.200]
You know, you can't do it.

[01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:47.740]
Oh, and I knew when those people were calling up while you were going, oh, Neil, if you're listening,

[01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:49.360]
I want to tell you, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:50.500]
I knew you weren't listening.

[01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:50.980]
No.

[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:52.680]
I end up when you're off.

[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:53.900]
Yeah.

[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:55.020]
Way off.

[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:55.980]
Well, I think we're in.

[01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:56.820]
Look at this book.

[01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:57.260]
Yeah.

[01:00:57.660 --> 01:00:58.720]
Well, I think it was God's will.

[01:00:58.980 --> 01:00:59.440]
The death now, man.

[01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:01.460]
Who wants those big numbers anyway, right?

[01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:01.700]
Yeah.

[01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:04.360]
Too much responsibility goes with big numbers.

[01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:07.340]
I think it was God's will that you took that extra week off.

[01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:07.780]
Yeah.

[01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:09.960]
Because if you didn't, that one would still be here.

[01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:11.040]
Really?

[01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:13.100]
He wouldn't have had that big fight with Rick and so.

[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:13.980]
Well, is that what did it?

[01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:16.200]
Oh, it was the Rick and so I'd sing to push them over.

[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:19.940]
I don't, but I don't understand what is a couple of people called.

[01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:22.400]
I mean, people call, rip him all the time on this station.

[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:23.400]
You should be used to it.

[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:28.460]
A couple of people called them, ripped him and what?

[01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:29.220]
And he went, no.

[01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:30.220]
He went, he came in.

[01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:31.120]
I'm going to kick it.

[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:32.720]
If I had, if I could, I would.

[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:33.040]
But what?

[01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:33.560]
Over what?

[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:34.580]
Over what?

[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:37.460]
Because a couple of people had called in and they said, oh, Alex stinks.

[01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:38.160]
No, he does.

[01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:42.760]
I think we're really, I think somebody might have said something about two bad you guys aren't doing two to six or something.

[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:44.380]
And that's what really pushed them over.

[01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:45.480]
Well, isn't it interesting?

[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:49.520]
Steve was paranoid when Alex came in, filled in for me when I was on vacation.

[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:50.600]
And look what he thought.

[01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:54.360]
He thought they were looking, he was looking for his job and Alex wound up getting his job.

[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:56.140]
Now, Alex comes in.

[01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:59.020]
And he's paranoid when I'm out sick and he's guys come in and fill in.

[01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:03.200]
He thinks that they're looking for his job and now they're getting it.

[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:05.660]
So he has a big fight with him.

[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:06.120]
Yes.

[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:07.160]
Then he goes on.

[01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:07.920]
There's one more I'm starting.

[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:10.000]
You got the tape, he goes on, he's showing.

[01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:12.080]
He says, I'm letting management know right now.

[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:13.220]
You come on here.

[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:13.480]
Yep.

[01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:15.060]
And you bash me.

[01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:19.560]
So he says, if these men ever come back in the studio, I'm walking out.

[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.740]
No two ways about it.

[01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:25.820]
And it's very obvious you two guys are out of work and you want the afternoon shift around here.

[01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:29.840]
So they come back the next day and they say, well, okay, okay, yeah.

[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:30.900]
That was the end of the week.

[01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:32.360]
He thought you were coming back on Monday.

[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:32.660]
Yeah.

[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:34.580]
He said, if they ever come back, I'm out of here.

[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:35.940]
And you didn't come back in again.

[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:38.440]
So they came back Monday and they said, well, we're still here, Alex.

[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:39.520]
You know, it's your game.

[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:40.620]
You're ball game, you know.

[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:41.300]
I don't get it.

[01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:45.060]
This guy is so, how could he possibly have ever been in this business before?

[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:50.340]
Oh, so he comes in and he goes, well, I have a contract that I can't really walk out.

[01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:54.820]
But, you know, I want to forget all this and get past it and we're going to declare a truth.

[01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:57.460]
You know, and he just basically had to eat crow that week.

[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:00.040]
And then, you know, everyone, somebody's down.

[01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:00.840]
We like to kick them.

[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:05.720]
So in the team, everybody started calling them off and saying, Alex, you said you were going to leave.

[01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:06.660]
How come you're still here?

[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:08.620]
You have no integrity, you know, and all this.

[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:10.740]
And he just blew it. He went crazy.

[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:12.660]
What a shame.

[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:16.040]
It's the most tasteless thing I've ever heard in my life.

[01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:16.780]
Yeah.

[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:21.520]
Well, listen to the great job narrating Alex's commentary there and I appreciate it.

[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:23.920]
I can't wait till he goes back to tell Pendulate about this.

[01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:24.180]
Yeah.

[01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:27.600]
And Al Goldstein won't send me any more love letters, I guess.

[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:29.620]
Oh, I got another billboard sighting for you.

[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:30.440]
Are they bad?

[01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:33.760]
Well, it's under repair of the line, see.

[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:38.140]
It's on the Palmetto Expressway.

[01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:38.340]
Yeah.

[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:40.980]
Going north just before 103rd street, Nilelia.

[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:41.520]
Okay.

[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:45.220]
And I went by there one night and for some reason there's no light on it at night.

[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:49.700]
So all I could see was the top of your head and I said, Nile, ride your 610.

[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:51.320]
Something in front of your face.

[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:51.760]
Yeah.

[01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:54.840]
And I thought it was supposed to be like a gag or like a bl-uh.

[01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:57.520]
You know, gag around your mouth to keep you quiet or something.

[01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:02.040]
And then I heard Rick and Fudz the next day talking about, well, it's supposed to be a bar of soap.

[01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:07.640]
So I drove by during the day to take a look at it and, uh, it looks like a mattress stuck in your mouth or something.

[01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:11.440]
Yeah. Well, the guy was putting up the billboard, dropped the soap there and it's trying to...

[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:12.920]
Well, listen, have a great day.

[01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:14.360]
Okay, I'm glad you're back.

[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:14.880]
Thank you.

[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:15.320]
Okay.

[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:16.860]
Well, isn't it funny he was talking about that.

[01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:18.240]
Now I got to talk about white huts.

[01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:22.000]
Well, a lot of pressure more than I thought there would be 1227 and WIOD.

[01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:23.280]
We got to get that audience back.

[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:25.060]
We got to get the audience back.

[01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:26.880]
There's only one way to do it.

[01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:28.060]
Cut.

[01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:29.420]
Cut.

[01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:31.520]
Let's play it till two o'clock, okay?

[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:34.540]
Okay, one around till everybody to burn his back.

[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:36.540]
See if I just played it, they'd never know the difference.

[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:36.800]
No.

[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:37.060]
Okay.

[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:38.800]
Look at it first.

[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:41.520]
I said, uh, he's a douchebag in the background.

[01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:43.180]
They don't know if it's live or on Kurt.

[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:45.160]
So the bird is back.

[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:48.220]
Now see Melvin thinks the show sucks without clanting.

[01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:49.220]
He thinks the show is terrible.

[01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:51.200]
It was much better when he was here and he's wrong.

[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:53.720]
The show was not better when the bird was here.

[01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:57.200]
The show was Phoebe Cates and what was the other thing?

[01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.760]
He had like three things.

[01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:01.620]
Tenus, Phoebe Cates and what was the other one?

[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:03.160]
No, I'm serious.

[01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:06.200]
That's all he had was like three things that he ever talked about.

[01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:07.660]
What was the thing?

[01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:08.680]
No, Lakeland.

[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:09.200]
Oh.

[01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:09.840]
Lakeland.

[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:11.540]
Which who the hell wants to talk about?

[01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:12.020]
I'm not Lakeland.

[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:15.500]
I'd rather talk about Canon Dagel before I talk about Lakeland.

[01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:18.120]
At least Larry King gets some calls from up there.

[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:19.000]
Right Ron?

[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:19.680]
That's right.

[01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:20.560]
How about what's turn?

[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:21.980]
And I'll be on.

[01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:22.400]
Yeah.

[01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:22.740]
Yeah.

[01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:23.180]
You're right.

[01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:24.900]
You know, my rock.

[01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:25.780]
It's worth 29.

[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:27.260]
It's just a CEO.

[01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:28.600]
It's on your music way.

[01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:30.200]
Nobody stops Ron.

[01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:30.960]
Once he gets going.

[01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:32.640]
There's no stopping it.

[01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:34.520]
Oh, did you hear that?

[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:35.160]
Good one.

[01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:36.420]
He nailed it.

[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:37.960]
Bad record though, Ron.

[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:40.700]
Okay, 28th pass known at WIOD.

[01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:42.700]
Here's North Del Rey.

[01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:43.840]
Nail?

[01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:45.900]
Not to be confused with Del Rey proper.

[01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:46.840]
Right, correct.

[01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:47.600]
Yes, sir.

[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:49.300]
Well, we try not to keep our cell.

[01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:50.240]
We'll try to keep our cell.

[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:50.720]
I shouldn't say.

[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:51.620]
Who is this?

[01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:53.740]
A radio person.

[01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:54.140]
No.

[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:56.320]
Well, you sound like he's got a radio.

[01:05:56.580 --> 01:05:56.760]
Oh, yeah.

[01:05:57.660 --> 01:05:58.240]
Everybody tells me.

[01:05:58.240 --> 01:05:59.280]
Now, what shift would you like?

[01:05:59.460 --> 01:05:59.640]
Stop.

[01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:02.140]
All right, tell me what you know.

[01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:02.380]
We can't, man.

[01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:03.040]
Our desperate.

[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:06.260]
The weekends on this station have dropped like since the last off in game.

[01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:08.160]
Nobody listens on the weekend, man.

[01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:09.060]
They're like a two.

[01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:10.620]
I'm not a big fan of Joey.

[01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:11.940]
So I'll take his spot.

[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:14.480]
Well, he's got a lot of company there.

[01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:15.520]
That home?

[01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:16.520]
What?

[01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:17.220]
At home?

[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:17.940]
Yeah.

[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:19.900]
He just wants his Porsche.

[01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:23.680]
By the way, Joey, I don't want to make you feel bad because I know you're listening.

[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:27.560]
But I got rid of the Ferrari and I got a Porsche 928.

[01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:28.720]
Yeah, I feel bad.

[01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:29.220]
Why?

[01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:31.620]
You didn't get a lot of money on it.

[01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:32.560]
Why did you feel bad?

[01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:33.580]
Did you like double?

[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:34.240]
No.

[01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:35.620]
Come on.

[01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:37.980]
You have to mind your own business.

[01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:38.660]
Time and a half.

[01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:39.760]
So what do you want, sir?

[01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:43.480]
You didn't get the 928 S or the 928 S for anything special.

[01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:44.520]
928 S.

[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:45.280]
It's really?

[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:46.040]
Not a new one.

[01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:46.460]
86.

[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:47.440]
And it's nice.

[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:48.500]
It's like it's brand new.

[01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:49.300]
It's a good car.

[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:49.860]
Yeah.

[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:50.800]
Are you okay?

[01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:51.420]
Yeah.

[01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:55.800]
Anyway, I've never called you while I called you.

[01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:57.480]
I guess I should mention Lou Backroad Chevy.

[01:06:57.700 --> 01:06:58.860]
Do they advertise on this station?

[01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:00.880]
Well, that's where I bought it.

[01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:03.520]
They used to have the big nose up on 95, didn't they?

[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:03.680]
Yeah.

[01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:06.080]
Now that's me with a big borrow of something in my mouth.

[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:08.520]
I never called you.

[01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:09.940]
I called you about a month ago.

[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:13.140]
I was going to Las Vegas in Los Angeles.

[01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:13.640]
Yeah.

[01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:17.620]
I came back and you were off the air and people were saying, oh my God, we don't know.

[01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:20.020]
You know, and I was, oh, I'm so glad you're back.

[01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:20.540]
Yeah.

[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:22.920]
And we got to see, he's back too.

[01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:24.560]
Spread the word.

[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:25.640]
Don't do it.

[01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:26.160]
No.

[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:27.760]
I had a great idea.

[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:29.460]
Listen, I know the way people think.

[01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:33.300]
And knowing the management here in a way they overreact everything, they're going to look at that.

[01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:34.260]
They're going to say, oh, look at this.

[01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:36.440]
There were sixes and sevens and now the birds gone.

[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:37.420]
He's doing a five one.

[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:39.880]
Of course, see the bird wasn't on the micronary show.

[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:41.940]
And he wasn't on an afternoon drive.

[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:43.460]
And he certainly wasn't on at night.

[01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:45.080]
And he wasn't on the weekend.

[01:07:45.460 --> 01:07:49.980]
So, you know, any excuse they're going to come up with is going to be wrong as usual.

[01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:50.700]
They're always wrong.

[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:54.080]
They're management and they have to answer to somebody so they're making up what they have.

[01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:54.180]
Yeah.

[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:57.580]
Anyway, Ceejers Palace is a great place.

[01:07:58.120 --> 01:07:58.380]
It is.

[01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:00.300]
The Mirage was absolutely gorgeous.

[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:03.940]
And we had a good time at the Circus Circus.

[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:07.340]
Never made it to the Tropicana to have your...

[01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:08.020]
Rhapsody, yeah.

[01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:08.460]
Yeah.

[01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:09.480]
Never made it there.

[01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:10.860]
Well, it's probably just as good of an idea.

[01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:12.620]
You live longer without that finance foster.

[01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:13.880]
Probably right.

[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:14.900]
Not that I needed it already.

[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:15.700]
Stay out of the hospital.

[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:16.200]
Exactly.

[01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:19.600]
Alex Bennett, he just has a bad attitude, that's all.

[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:20.520]
Yeah.

[01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:21.640]
That's a good way to put it.

[01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:21.940]
I mean...

[01:08:21.940 --> 01:08:22.720]
Got a crappy attitude.

[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:24.300]
So, this town is a tough town.

[01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:26.120]
But, you know, you got to be a big boy.

[01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:26.460]
Right.

[01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:27.280]
You got to let it roll off your back.

[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:28.660]
When you get to be as old as he is.

[01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:30.460]
If you didn't take himself so seriously.

[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:30.940]
Yeah.

[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:33.160]
You know, that's the way I...

[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:34.900]
I mean, how many times can you hear Larry Brenler

[01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:37.140]
and then you stand up comedians who won't stand up, you know?

[01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:37.460]
Exactly.

[01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:40.180]
And who was that guy that came coming in playing the keyboard

[01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:41.280]
and his friend, the comedian?

[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:43.180]
Larry Brenler, oh yeah, Eric, you're in the air.

[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:43.320]

[01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:45.160]
How many times did we hear the hair lady?

[01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:46.280]
I mean, they're...

[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:46.820]
Yeah, really.

[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:47.520]
I mean, they're...

[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:49.180]
I'm sure Alex is a nice guy.

[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:51.620]
It's just, you know, he didn't know how to handle it.

[01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:53.220]
Well, these guys don't think he's a nice guy.

[01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:54.320]
They're giving all kinds of looks.

[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:55.580]
They're not saying anything but like,

[01:08:57.380 --> 01:08:59.960]
get the clean up crew in here with a pale and a bucket.

[01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:01.340]
Yeah.

[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:02.000]
Blue tongue.

[01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:03.740]
Yeah, it's from these.

[01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:04.580]
I just think he's...

[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:06.000]
Oh boy.

[01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:06.760]
Boy, you're...

[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:07.860]
You have a blu-tongue.

[01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:09.100]
You have a blu-tongue?

[01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:11.160]
I had a stroke and he thinks I got a blu-tongue.

[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:11.900]
Okay, it's from...

[01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:13.140]
No, they're different colors.

[01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:14.020]
They're red and green.

[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:14.160]

[01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:16.100]
Don't you understand it's an authority.

[01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:18.820]
No, if this is a side, we should be looking forward to it.

[01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:20.480]
So we came in to be spotters.

[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:21.600]
Yeah, spot this.

[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:24.040]
Well, listen, have a wonderful life.

[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:25.160]
That's good hearing from you.

[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:25.660]
They're your third.

[01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:26.200]
See in Vegas.

[01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:26.580]
Okay.

[01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:26.920]
Bye.

[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:29.200]
Don't he sound like a radio person though?

[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:30.160]
I thought he was one.

[01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:32.220]
Even Boken Palm Beach have been bringing to they.

[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:34.380]
Now, your phones have been great all two weeks.

[01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:34.980]
Oh, yeah.

[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:35.280]
Oh, yeah.

[01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:36.900]
No.

[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:37.960]
No, really, they have.

[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:38.420]
Pretty good.

[01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:38.980]
They've been excellent.

[01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:39.600]
Not loaded.

[01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:41.620]
I didn't have any problem with that post-align.

[01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:42.560]
What do you mean?

[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:42.940]
At all.

[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:44.860]
Well, everybody goes to it.

[01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:46.000]
So like there's nobody on there.

[01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:48.200]
Oh, there's nobody on it right now.

[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.600]
Here's a mobile O.J.L.

[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:51.960]
Hey, Neil, how's it going?

[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:55.180]
Yeah, I'm really happy to hear you back.

[01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:55.940]
You sound great.

[01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:57.680]
And I hope you stay, you know, fine.

[01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:58.060]
Yeah.

[01:09:58.260 --> 01:09:59.060]
Well, it's an important thing.

[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:00.460]
I'll feel real good about five to two.

[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:02.420]
Yeah, that's the best time in the world, huh?

[01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:02.840]
Yeah.

[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:06.080]
I think Alex couldn't handle the number of sunshine state

[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:06.940]
but the crappy state.

[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:09.340]
Yes, I couldn't handle the pressure, I think.

[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:11.180]
It ought to be.

[01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:13.140]
Yeah, you're right.

[01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:15.140]
It took everything too serious, you know what I mean?

[01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:15.780]
It's the show.

[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:17.360]
Yeah, just a radio show.

[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:18.360]
It's the way to make a living.

[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:20.820]
Yeah, I mean, of course the community and the people were terrible.

[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:23.180]
Well, he wanted everybody to suck up to him, I guess,

[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:23.980]
and it didn't happen.

[01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:26.560]
And then he gets all that out of shape and hostile.

[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:29.320]
And I mean, you got to, you got to, you can't have thin skin

[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:30.140]
and do this kind of work.

[01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:31.040]
Yeah, I do it.

[01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:32.760]
And it's obvious the name drop, he's in work.

[01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:33.380]
Yeah.

[01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:34.800]
Because they call it other dropping.

[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:36.940]
And you notice when he would drop out of those names,

[01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:39.040]
it was always one of my very best friends.

[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:40.280]
I hear that many friends.

[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:41.780]
I couldn't keep track of, you know?

[01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:42.740]
Yeah, I like how ghosting, yeah.

[01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:43.980]
It's very best friends.

[01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:44.900]
Well, I like Al.

[01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:46.220]
I'm not going to get upset at Al.

[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:47.980]
You know, I'm not going to mix him in, but you know,

[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:48.680]
Al is.

[01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:50.700]
He's got a bet now for Danza.

[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:51.480]
He's a funny guy too.

[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:52.460]
He even called us.

[01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:52.900]
Did he?

[01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:53.660]
Yeah, he's good.

[01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:54.180]
I like him.

[01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:56.380]
Now, now he made it mistake, he called Rick and Spud.

[01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:56.660]
Yep.

[01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:58.480]
Well, he's just a death.

[01:10:58.760 --> 01:10:59.300]
Oh boy.

[01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:00.920]
He's covering his ass, don't you understand?

[01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:02.080]
Yep, be sure is.

[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:03.660]
He can't do you call you every day now.

[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:05.000]
Why don't you end your life?

[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.280]
Just like our management, they're getting ready to do that right now.

[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:10.880]
Now that the book is in, they're writing all kinds of inter-office memos

[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:12.560]
and making that paper trail, you know?

[01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:14.320]
Well, they got it just covered in their ass.

[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:16.220]
They got it just to fight a salary, you know?

[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:16.480]

[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:18.640]
This was on Janemberg's house, it's all right.

[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:19.640]
That's all I can't.

[01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:21.640]
Just like when Steve was here, we had a lot of business, right?

[01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:22.400]
Yes, this is my wife.

[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:24.640]
Well, we spoiled, but we had a mess with success, man.

[01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:27.640]
We had to change it, screw it around, mess over the audience.

[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:28.880]
But that's usually a mess with us.

[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:30.480]
Let's make a few more changes, huh?

[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:30.860]
Yeah.

[01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:31.520]
When you mess, sir?

[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:34.380]
Let's add the cups at 9 instead of the Yankees.

[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:35.040]
There you go.

[01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:36.520]
That'll give him a pause here.

[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:37.640]
Okay, have a great life.

[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:40.600]
Anyway, do you ever play a film in a song?

[01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:42.120]
That Denemberg song?

[01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:43.320]
I just played it.

[01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:44.480]
Oh, I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:45.000]
I wasn't quite.

[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.120]
Wait a minute.

[01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:46.860]
Wait a minute.

[01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:48.440]
You were in court?

[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:49.300]
Yeah, yeah.

[01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:52.060]
You expect me to play that twice in the same show?

[01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:52.840]
No, I wasn't.

[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:57.100]
He was the world's biggest household.

[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:01.500]
Stop, Annemberg, stop, Annemberg.

[01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:02.380]
Thank you.

[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:03.980]
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, everyone.

[01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:04.340]
You're welcome.

[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:07.760]
1235 in WI-O, dude, that was a good one, a little duet.

[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:09.680]
And it sure fit too, Bob.

[01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:11.820]
I'm not even here, five minutes this morning in Denemberg.

[01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:13.260]
Can you cut this copy for me?

[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:14.780]
You can do, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:15.960]
You know, I'm sitting here shaking.

[01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:17.320]
I can barely sit in the chair.

[01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:20.480]
You know, and the guy's already in here just...

[01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:22.000]
You want to help him down while you're receptive.

[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:22.000]

[01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:24.500]
Near death.

[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:27.260]
And I said, Tom, did you see the bar of soap on a billboard?

[01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:29.820]
Anyway, here's a message from the...

[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:33.040]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:36.420]
Oh, I never saw anybody move that fast in my life, dude.

[01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:37.280]
Can you believe that?

[01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:40.480]
Boy, and look at these guys leaning away from...

[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:42.700]
I'm not going to mention your name, God.

[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:49.400]
The rumor is that somebody is not coming back any afternoon on the air.

[01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:51.560]
But we'll be in the building somewhere.

[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:52.300]
Eric Lambert.

[01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:53.000]
Yeah.

[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:54.260]
And the hair lady.

[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:54.680]
Yeah.

[01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:57.920]
And Alice Cooper, what was your name?

[01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:58.940]
Alice Colin.

[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:00.700]
The whole in lady.

[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:02.820]
The colon lady.

[01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:04.120]
He hangs out with the urine lady.

[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.160]
And to those people are not coming back, I guess.

[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:09.300]
So, look at that. The Palm Beach Line is open.

[01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:12.560]
We've had all these... I've never given any number out all day long.

[01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:15.880]
And it took like two and a half hours, and that's it in Palm Beach.

[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:16.720]
Well, that's not too bad.

[01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:17.440]
Coral Springs.

[01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:18.100]
Oh, hi.

[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:18.780]
Yeah.

[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:19.980]
I can't believe I got through.

[01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:20.700]
You got through.

[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:22.740]
And it's easy on this show no problem.

[01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:26.040]
Well, I think I got you delay time, so I had it down there.

[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:28.100]
First of all, a big welcome back.

[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:28.680]
Thank you.

[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:29.740]
I love hearing you back.

[01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:31.760]
I loved Rick and Suz, and I love hearing you back.

[01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:33.100]
And you love Alex Bennett?

[01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:34.760]
Well, he's okay.

[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:36.080]
Yeah, far away.

[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:38.020]
From a distance, like in San Francisco.

[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:41.100]
Oh, he was better. He was better. Why?

[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:42.300]
I went to a show twice.

[01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:42.820]
Yeah.

[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:43.820]
He was better on purpose.

[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:45.880]
I just... I'm the radio. I couldn't deal with it.

[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:46.620]
You mentioned it before.

[01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:49.220]
Well, that's because he did the show for the six people that were sitting in the building.

[01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:49.500]
Exactly.

[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:51.060]
The chairs, by the way, are all gone.

[01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:51.960]
Are they gone?

[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:53.180]
Is that mean something?

[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:56.240]
The chairs are gone. His carts are all gone.

[01:13:56.360 --> 01:14:00.780]
The opens and closes and intros and promos are all gone from the rack.

[01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:04.380]
What about those vitamins from those like weird nature people?

[01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:05.940]
Oh, yeah. From...

[01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:06.600]
The horseshoe lady.

[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:07.120]
Uh-huh.

[01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:09.460]
Oh, no. Those are gone too.

[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:10.440]
Orchhoe lady.

[01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:10.860]

[01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:12.480]
Yeah, lady bent the horsehoe.

[01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:14.000]
Well, it was horse something, but he sent shoes.

[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:14.340]
Oh, yeah.

[01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:15.620]
To be nice.

[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:16.440]
Closes he could get.

[01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:18.600]
Well, I noticed on your billboards.

[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:19.180]
Yeah.

[01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:21.360]
Way up here. They got one on sample roads.

[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:21.760]
Great.

[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:26.300]
I swear, first, the first time I saw it, I thought it was like a big piece of paper or something in your mouth.

[01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:28.740]
That gave me the biggest lip.

[01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:30.540]
I've ever seen in my life.

[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:31.800]
Now it's green, though, isn't it?

[01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:35.160]
Nope. Because the soap screen, the lips like big apple red.

[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:38.780]
Now that's like that movie shocker that I saw last night where he bites the guy's lip.

[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:39.480]
Oh.

[01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:42.540]
And the lip just expand like about the old man.

[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:48.100]
It was pretty big. It was a huge obstacle.

[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:49.220]
What, the lip?

[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:49.880]
Yeah.

[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:51.380]
Oh, excuse me.

[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:53.580]
I don't want to get too personal, sir.

[01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:58.620]
By the way, did anybody mention to you about the ACN tape they put out?

[01:14:59.020 --> 01:14:59.200]
No.

[01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:01.740]
Yeah, they, um, they put out a call outrageous radio.

[01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:02.660]
I picked it up the other day.

[01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:05.340]
Oh, no, yeah, but no, we did a commercial for that. It's its specs.

[01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:07.300]
Oh, they got it over. They got it.

[01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:09.080]
No, don't mention anybody else.

[01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:09.220]
Okay.

[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:09.940]
I got it. It's specs.

[01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:11.860]
Oh, okay. I got it somewhere else.

[01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:12.620]
Well, that's okay.

[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:13.740]
I didn't know anybody.

[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:15.840]
Next time you'll get it at specs or else.

[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:17.960]
But I'm sure I paid much, much more than I would have it.

[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:18.480]
That's right.

[01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:19.460]
They got it at specs.

[01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:20.100]
Yeah.

[01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:22.100]
Okay. Well, good.

[01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:23.220]
No, go ahead.

[01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:25.040]
I don't want to step on your material.

[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:27.280]
So what? So the billboard was bad?

[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:31.800]
It was, well, I didn't like I said it's not the most, uh, I've seen your picture.

[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:33.660]
I went to one of your, um, things.

[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.400]
Yeah. One of you, I want to see your thing.

[01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:37.020]
And I have your picture.

[01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:40.720]
And I saw the billboard and I just kind of had to look at your picture again and make sure.

[01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:43.180]
Well, no, I'm not talking about whether it looked good.

[01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:44.360]
My picture looked good enough.

[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:46.940]
But with the billboard effective, or was it a piece of mong?

[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:48.800]
Well, I guess rumor.

[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:54.220]
I don't want to say who shaking has had no, but rumor is that in the room here is that it's a piece of crap.

[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:55.780]
Well, it says bad mouth.

[01:15:55.860 --> 01:16:00.880]
Don't you think maybe they need a new agency here in the station and who ever add agency to handle our promotion?

[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:06.480]
I mean, between the contest of that contest we did the mail out, you know, yeah, I remember that.

[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:08.340]
I think we had the lowest book the station's had.

[01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:16.060]
I think probably in two years and everybody went in the toilet and now these billboards that were drawn by a Gilbert, I think.

[01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:20.000]
Well, listen, it's very no expense.

[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:23.940]
Well, I say, um, also, I guess what, then you know, they put bad mouth.

[01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:26.280]
So what type of people are trying to get to listen to you?

[01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:27.380]
Do spanks.

[01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:27.940]
Yeah, basically.

[01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:28.720]
That's what we want.

[01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:29.600]
I fit right in.

[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:30.040]
Look at you.

[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:31.020]
Okay, have a good one.

[01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:32.120]
Okay, thanks for that.

[01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:32.540]
Thank you.

[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:32.800]
Bye.

[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:34.600]
1242 at WIOD.

[01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:36.700]
We got a mobile on the West Palm Line.

[01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:37.060]
Hello.

[01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:38.340]
Hey, Neil, welcome back.

[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:38.900]
Thank you.

[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:40.480]
But you're not the only thing that's back.

[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:41.980]
Guess what else is back?

[01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:43.580]
The love bugs.

[01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:44.520]
Yeah, I know.

[01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:46.360]
Jesus, I can't even see now.

[01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:48.820]
I can't wait till Spencer gets in here Wednesday.

[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:52.280]
My Corvette is so filthy because I haven't been able to wash it, you know, for two weeks.

[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:56.900]
And it's got love bugs and mong and just crap all over it.

[01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:58.060]
Yeah, this is incredible.

[01:16:58.060 --> 01:17:02.160]
I was almost ready to send away for some of that crap they sell on TV where they set the car on fire.

[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:03.140]
Oh, that's my favorite.

[01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:03.740]
Oh, yeah.

[01:17:03.740 --> 01:17:04.880]
Let me speak to putt for a minute.

[01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:06.120]
Yeah, he's right here.

[01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:06.560]
Hey, putt.

[01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:07.720]
This is for you, putt.

[01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:09.280]
No, no, this putt for you.

[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:09.740]
Yeah.

[01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:09.880]
Yeah.

[01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:10.940]
Did you see that moving?

[01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:12.600]
Did you see that moving last night?

[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:14.440]
Oh, it's one.

[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:16.240]
The one criminal justice.

[01:17:16.660 --> 01:17:16.920]
No.

[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:18.840]
Kevin Pigg.

[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:19.440]
No.

[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:21.020]
What's the name Kevin Pigg, I think, right?

[01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:22.080]
What's the Simpsons?

[01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:22.480]
Kevin.

[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:23.260]
Right to bed.

[01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:25.080]
Oh, these people talking about Kevin Bacon.

[01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:25.660]
Kevin Bacon.

[01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:28.320]
We've been putt loose and he was in that one with the preacher.

[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:28.980]
Or was that movie?

[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:31.360]
Uh, yeah, preacher and the film.

[01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:32.960]
No, no, no.

[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:34.300]
Forget it.

[01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:36.380]
He used to be on a guiding light, Kevin Bacon.

[01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:37.260]
He used to play Tim.

[01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:38.800]
Tim.

[01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:39.240]
Gillette.

[01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:40.880]
Yeah.

[01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:42.140]
Leisurelet.

[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:43.460]
Leisurelet.

[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:44.260]
Yeah.

[01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:45.560]
Hey, how about those cubbies?

[01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:46.920]
He used to play poison pen.

[01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:50.120]
What did you say, Tim?

[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:50.580]
How about those cubbies?

[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:51.500]
Did you mention the cubs?

[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:51.780]
Yeah.

[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.360]
When does the season start?

[01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:54.160]
Yeah, all right.

[01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:57.840]
I tell you one thing, Mike Bellucky can pitch to Bobby Bonnier every day.

[01:17:57.860 --> 01:17:59.140]
I'll be a hell of a season, wouldn't it?

[01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:02.160]
He's only giving up three home runs to him in his last four at bats.

[01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:04.620]
But he still looks good.

[01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:05.440]
He still looks good anyway.

[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:06.120]
That's all accounts.

[01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:08.840]
We ain't outplayed well, but we look good.

[01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:09.320]
Yeah.

[01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:14.000]
When they play a double header, do they get to the stand to make the people leave?

[01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:14.400]
No.

[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:15.080]
Come back in.

[01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:16.560]
No, that's why they hate double headers.

[01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:17.380]
They used to do that.

[01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:18.380]
They can't do that anymore.

[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.820]
Well, I know the change to that when they, you know, like the hurricane.

[01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:21.960]
Well, they need the money, you know.

[01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:22.960]
They make them go out.

[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:24.620]
They're really doing it too, by the way, aren't they?

[01:18:25.220 --> 01:18:26.720]
Well, they do, they win every day.

[01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:28.080]
Are they doing good?

[01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:30.120]
They're like 42 and 6, I think.

[01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:30.700]
They're right.

[01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:31.860]
Yeah, they're doing it.

[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.300]
Well, they should be an Idaho pretty soon, then, right?

[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:35.160]
And the world's great.

[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:36.960]
No, they could be an Idaho or they could be an Omaha,

[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:38.560]
Hone of Brasker for the college world series.

[01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:39.940]
Whichever one they, you know, like that.

[01:18:39.940 --> 01:18:41.140]
Yeah, where are the potatoes are?

[01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:41.520]
Yeah.

[01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:43.040]
Where whatever state that is.

[01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:46.540]
Listen, I think you ran out of material about three minutes ago,

[01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:47.580]
but it's been a great call.

[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:48.240]
One material.

[01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:48.720]
Yeah.

[01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:50.060]
Have a great day.

[01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:50.740]
That's nice.

[01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:51.640]
Nice pocket.

[01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:53.180]
I'm glad they nailed my pocket.

[01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:53.380]
Yeah.

[01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:56.000]
You know, the lady that did call in, I heard that call.

[01:18:56.180 --> 01:18:58.820]
She called in that day that you were spurring your speech.

[01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:02.420]
And she didn't mention that you might be having a mild stroke.

[01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:03.300]
I said that.

[01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:04.320]
No, I wasn't having it.

[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:05.160]
I'd already had it.

[01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:05.640]
Well, whatever.

[01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:06.860]
But you mentioned that.

[01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:10.760]
But that, that, what's the name Rick kept saying that she never mentioned the word stroke?

[01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:13.260]
Well, you know, the funny, yes, he did say that.

[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:16.540]
And the funny part is I came in here this morning before I went on the year,

[01:19:16.540 --> 01:19:19.180]
and I said to Melvin, and I said to a couple other people in the building,

[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:22.960]
I think I had a mild stroke in my sleep, and they looked at me like,

[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:24.780]
ah, like I was nuts.

[01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:26.040]
You know, he said stroke.

[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:26.360]
Yes.

[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:27.980]
He said the word stroke.

[01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:30.320]
He said, T.I.A. is a mild wasn't it?

[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:31.240]
It was a stroke.

[01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:34.940]
Yeah, but he did say it's a form of a mild stroke.

[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:35.960]
Okay, I'm sorry, sir.

[01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:36.400]
You were right.

[01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:36.960]
Stroke this.

[01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:37.920]
Have a great day, pal.

[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:38.920]
No, wait, one quick thing.

[01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:44.420]
Where's the rest of your head on the slide by the Okachobi Road in Palmello Expressway?

[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:45.520]
Right under the bar asso.

[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:46.200]
See you later.

[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:47.900]
Oh, some of these people.

[01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:49.780]
Oh, I munged on my shirt with that.

[01:19:49.780 --> 01:19:51.920]
Well, they did. They had you up, and then they ripped your head off.

[01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:53.600]
That's when they changed.

[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:55.740]
Well, I said I'm going to kick my teeth down my goddamn throat.

[01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:56.220]
Yes, wrote.

[01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:58.100]
Okay, that's when they ripped my head off.

[01:19:58.680 --> 01:19:59.900]
They're sending it to Alex.

[01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:01.400]
Here's a collect call from San Francisco.

[01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:03.040]
Hi, Dale.

[01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:03.780]
Who's this?

[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:05.120]
This is Mead and San Francisco.

[01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:05.980]
Welcome back.

[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:06.500]
Mead?

[01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:08.020]
N-E-A-D, mead.

[01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:08.660]
Oh, mead.

[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:09.360]
Yeah.

[01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:10.780]
Everybody's mead.

[01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:11.960]
Yeah, that's what I thought.

[01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:13.260]
Don't get your hopes up, now.

[01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:13.800]
No, sir.

[01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:15.000]
Not this kid.

[01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:17.880]
Yeah, I'm just, uh, I'm giving up everything for suckers.

[01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:21.920]
I'm just staying home and eating my little, uh, chicken breast, and that's it.

[01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:24.180]
I understand Alex is on his way here.

[01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:24.500]
What is that?

[01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:26.720]
That's where we understand he's on his way back with Tony Bennett.

[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:27.560]
Tony Alex.

[01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:29.440]
Big black cloud out here.

[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:30.420]
Hey, Frisco brother, this young.

[01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:31.240]
Maybe that's him.

[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:32.360]
Are you really in San Francisco?

[01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:33.560]
Yes, sir, I am.

[01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:34.100]
I'll be damned.

[01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:35.520]
How's it doing out there?

[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:36.600]
It's the cold, always.

[01:20:36.740 --> 01:20:38.080]
Giants aren't doing too good, are they?

[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:39.500]
I don't know. I'm from there.

[01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:40.380]
I'm just out here on business.

[01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:40.960]
Oh.

[01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:42.660]
Yeah, it's a lovely place.

[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:45.280]
How about that new hockey team we're in the, what is that league now?

[01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:46.760]
The hockey team?

[01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:48.680]
The global hockey league.

[01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:50.220]
My name is going to have a hockey team.

[01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:50.680]
Yeah, that's a good idea.

[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:52.760]
We're going to play Prague and Budapest.

[01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:54.780]
Well, it'd be great.

[01:20:55.020 --> 01:20:55.620]
Shouldn't be a problem.

[01:20:55.700 --> 01:20:56.880]
We're going to put a punch around there.

[01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:57.100]
Yeah.

[01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:58.500]
Well, we got a put's right here.

[01:20:58.500 --> 01:20:59.500]
So he'll put it right in.

[01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:00.820]
What the hell is he doing there, by the way?

[01:21:00.980 --> 01:21:01.980]
Well, these guys filled in.

[01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:03.700]
Yeah. Why would you just give, oh, you're not back.

[01:21:03.820 --> 01:21:04.900]
I don't even know what I'm talking about.

[01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:05.820]
The guys in San Francisco.

[01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:08.880]
How was, how does he know so much, though, in San Francisco?

[01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:10.460]
Yeah, how long have you been out there?

[01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:11.140]
I have a spy.

[01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:12.540]
How long have you been there?

[01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:13.780]
Since last night.

[01:21:14.180 --> 01:21:15.840]
Oh, so you know what they're doing here?

[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:19.040]
Well, no, they came in today because management

[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:22.000]
was afraid that I might come in and not feel up to doing a whole four hours,

[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:22.920]
which was possible.

[01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:25.840]
And these here, you know, they were kind enough to come in and stand by.

[01:21:26.140 --> 01:21:27.060]
Well, I want you to know, I guess.

[01:21:27.060 --> 01:21:28.200]
Once they're going to get paid for it.

[01:21:28.340 --> 01:21:30.120]
I was down the street, so to speak, last night.

[01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:33.320]
I was asking several people about Alex Bennett.

[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:35.140]
I heard rumors that he wasn't coming back.

[01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:38.380]
And almost to the person, they said something like,

[01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:40.580]
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.

[01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:44.620]
And I think that literally translated means he sucks canal water.

[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:44.960]
Really?

[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:47.320]
Yeah, but we shouldn't kick him in when he's down, right?

[01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:49.440]
Only in his teeth.

[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:50.140]
That's right.

[01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:52.760]
Well, he turned Miami on it here.

[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:53.320]
I'll tell you that.

[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:53.840]
He sure did.

[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:54.640]
He really was wonderful.

[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:56.060]
He made a big impact here.

[01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:56.940]
No question about it.

[01:21:56.940 --> 01:21:59.500]
Well, he was going up a little loose 25 to 54s.

[01:21:59.520 --> 01:21:59.940]
Look out.

[01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:00.500]
Oh, yeah?

[01:22:00.740 --> 01:22:00.940]
Yeah.

[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:01.860]
Is he coming back?

[01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:02.320]
No.

[01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:03.220]
Well, this is history.

[01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:03.980]
History.

[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:05.780]
And we'll never hear him on this radio.

[01:22:05.980 --> 01:22:06.140]
What?

[01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:06.800]
He's coming back?

[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:08.000]
No, he's not.

[01:22:08.460 --> 01:22:09.900]
He's not coming back, Nick.

[01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:11.780]
Oh, should I cut about him his check?

[01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:12.400]
Yeah.

[01:22:12.620 --> 01:22:13.340]
Good luck to you, sir.

[01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:14.340]
Have a good time out there.

[01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:14.720]
Bye-bye.

[01:22:14.860 --> 01:22:15.460]
But not too good.

[01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:18.380]
1247, the W.A., he's not coming back.

[01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:19.860]
Trust me.

[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:22.760]
He knows he's not coming back.

[01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:24.560]
And he's putting on a story, you know?

[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:27.460]
Everybody in the building knows he's not coming back.

[01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:28.240]
And nobody else said.

[01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:29.440]
Because he doesn't know.

[01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:30.040]
Does he know what?

[01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:32.180]
I don't know.

[01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:33.340]
Nobody knows.

[01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:34.640]
I don't know.

[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:36.780]
Well, it's not.

[01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:39.640]
It's better than getting a certified letter, I guess, like from QAM.

[01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:41.760]
Maybe they'll put them on mornings on QAM.

[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:44.920]
Those stand-up comics would do it in the morning, wouldn't they?

[01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:45.580]
In Eric Lambert?

[01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:47.560]
Boy, how'd you like to wake up to the hair lady, huh?

[01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:51.180]
Anyway, it's 12 minutes till 1 at WIOD.

[01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:51.580]
Look at that.

[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:53.520]
We got a line open and date and Palm Beach.

[01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:54.420]
Two open seats.

[01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:55.840]
I didn't even take three hours.

[01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:58.200]
All that big, you know, that big rush.

[01:22:58.560 --> 01:22:59.020]
A lot of talk.

[01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:00.500]
And the big toolmult and fur.

[01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:01.400]
A's back.

[01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:03.180]
You know, it's just, you watch.

[01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:03.940]
Mark my words.

[01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:06.900]
By 2 o'clock we'll be sitting here struggling, talking to Joey.

[01:23:07.220 --> 01:23:12.460]
And so you got to, now your job is to keep him out of the studio before he, before I get out of here.

[01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:15.440]
To a lot of replay of what happened last time.

[01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:16.140]
Oh, God.

[01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:19.320]
If he comes in here and starts kissing again with that tongue and a whole bunch.

[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:19.820]
Oh, that's right.

[01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:20.480]
Remember that?

[01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:20.780]
God.

[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:21.720]
Disgusting.

[01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:22.780]
You're nauseating, Joey.

[01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:24.200]
Now, what do your wife slips in another room?

[01:23:24.380 --> 01:23:28.240]
Anyway, we're just trying to find out what the hell is going on, that's all.

[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:29.380]
And I'm driving to work.

[01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:32.080]
I have a show to do and I'm getting ticked off at you.

[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:32.540]
Yeah.

[01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:33.260]
Well, too bad.

[01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:35.360]
By the way, you don't have a show to do.

[01:23:35.900 --> 01:23:36.260]
1252.

[01:23:37.140 --> 01:23:38.220]
No, it's just been confirmed.

[01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:40.980]
I don't want to say it just, there was little notes slipped under the door.

[01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:42.240]
Somebody ran down the hallway.

[01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:43.140]
Somebody very short.

[01:23:43.140 --> 01:23:44.020]
It might have been Bob Mayor.

[01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:46.060]
And that's it.

[01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:46.600]
He's out.

[01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:49.320]
That's the rumor.

[01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:53.200]
A confirmed rumor that Alex will be gone no longer with us.

[01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:55.120]
Here's a mobile, no mobile.

[01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:55.820]
What is this?

[01:23:55.860 --> 01:23:56.460]
W-Y-O-D.

[01:23:56.620 --> 01:23:57.780]
Very important, mobile caller.

[01:23:58.060 --> 01:23:58.580]
Okay, sir.

[01:23:58.640 --> 01:23:59.360]
You're on right now.

[01:23:59.520 --> 01:23:59.800]
Hey, me.

[01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:00.340]
How you doing?

[01:24:00.340 --> 01:24:01.440]
Welcome to W-Y-O-D.

[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:03.100]
Remember us, 610 on the AM dial?

[01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:05.160]
Oh, you had the greatest thing that ever happened in radio.

[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:05.620]
That's right.

[01:24:05.900 --> 01:24:06.420]
Man, listen.

[01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:07.160]
Sit down a weekend.

[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:09.580]
I just want to inform you about some information with Jesus.

[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:10.520]
You're still guys.

[01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:11.240]
They did a good job.

[01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:11.860]
Yeah.

[01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:14.060]
Okay, they did an excellent job.

[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:15.400]
No show, but they're okay.

[01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:20.600]
And the only thing I didn't like is when they backed off of Alex when Alex asked him to back off.

[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:23.040]
But Alex was ripping them and then they would back off.

[01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:26.140]
You got to understand that we're just here filling in at the moment.

[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:27.760]
They didn't realize that we're going to get his job.

[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:30.320]
They were just here temporarily filling the breach in there.

[01:24:30.380 --> 01:24:36.240]
And we're not in the position to, you know, I'm sure it took them by surprise that the guy came in and went off the deep end.

[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:37.100]
Tough call, sir.

[01:24:37.260 --> 01:24:37.620]
Tough call.

[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:37.900]
Yeah.

[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:39.240]
So they can rip them now.

[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:40.000]
Oh, yeah.

[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:41.420]
They hit them like poison.

[01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:43.020]
They did a good job and I think Joey doesn't like it.

[01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:45.280]
Rick called me at home the other day and went on for like a half an hour.

[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:46.740]
I just put the phone down on the table.

[01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:49.160]
I went out to my medication, had a little lunch.

[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:50.440]
Thank God you're back.

[01:24:51.340 --> 01:24:51.780]
You're right.

[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:56.880]
I'm telling everybody up back and now I won't turn the radio off at 215.

[01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:58.300]
I'm just going to be seeing them and listen to them guys.

[01:24:58.540 --> 01:24:58.900]
All right.

[01:24:59.220 --> 01:24:59.540]
Excellent.

[01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:02.520]
Hey, I just want to call Billy to base play a douchebag.

[01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:03.020]
Okay.

[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:03.520]
Thanks, Neil.

[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:03.960]
Thank you.

[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:04.440]
Welcome back.

[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:08.480]
What are we going to do about these 25 to 54 numbers that went up and after him drive?

[01:25:08.700 --> 01:25:11.000]
Boy, pretty amazing.

[01:25:11.260 --> 01:25:11.600]
Pretty well.

[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:13.700]
All the rest of us were taking a little dive there.

[01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:14.960]
He was making a little crawl.

[01:25:15.660 --> 01:25:15.800]
Huh?

[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:17.900]
What does that mean?

[01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:18.420]
Shocking.

[01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:18.960]
Yeah.

[01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:20.680]
You can say that again.

[01:25:20.940 --> 01:25:20.940]

[01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:22.900]
Daniela.

[01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:23.920]
Yes, Neil.

[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.400]
I'm so glad you're finally back.

[01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:28.700]
I tell you, I really missed you, you know, on in the day.

[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:29.360]
Thank you.

[01:25:29.580 --> 01:25:33.380]
And, uh, you know, who else is back besides the bird that is?

[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:36.220]
Is Bo Brady's back on days of our life?

[01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:37.320]
Yeah.

[01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:39.240]
Somebody called about that before.

[01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:40.720]
Oh, I did that part.

[01:25:40.940 --> 01:25:41.380]
That's okay.

[01:25:41.660 --> 01:25:45.520]
But, uh, you know, it's really good to hear your voice on there and just keep well.

[01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:46.420]
Thank you.

[01:25:46.580 --> 01:25:46.920]
Okay.

[01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:47.780]
Have a nice one.

[01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:48.200]
Talk to you.

[01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:49.100]
Say hi to Doug and Julie.

[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:50.000]
Yeah, it's my.

[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:50.480]
See you later.

[01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:51.400]
Huh?

[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:54.760]
1254 at WIOD.

[01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:55.260]
Now, what was it?

[01:25:55.340 --> 01:26:00.540]
Oh, I want to thank the people at Orham Jewelers for this nice, a Cubs pin.

[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:01.940]
Wasn't that nice?

[01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:02.400]
Yeah.

[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:04.720]
And after they get over 500 again, I'll wear it.

[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:07.120]
No, it's, hey, listen, you know, I'm not a front runner.

[01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:08.960]
They lose every game the rest of the year.

[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:09.840]
I'm right there with Harry.

[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:11.720]
We're doing it all the way, okay?

[01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:13.360]
He's a little confused.

[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:16.460]
Oh, there was a great bit of game that they got rained out.

[01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:20.060]
In the pregame show, he was talking about.

[01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:22.200]
Harry Wendelstead or snowed out.

[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:24.140]
Was it a snowed in Chicago last week?

[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:27.900]
And he was talking about the Harry Wendelstead.

[01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:32.080]
It was the chief upher of the crew who we didn't call the game.

[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:35.900]
Of course, I don't think the umpire calls the game before it starts anyway.

[01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:39.900]
I think that's management of the home team that has that call, I believe.

[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:44.760]
But anyway, Harry was carrying on fears about, you know, if they're going to play,

[01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:45.660]
let's play now.

[01:26:45.660 --> 01:26:46.600]
It's not that bad.

[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:48.980]
If they're not, doesn't candy make the decision to call it?

[01:26:48.980 --> 01:26:51.860]
I'm always plugging his umpiring school and giving free plugs.

[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:53.260]
Don't go to his umpiring school.

[01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:56.780]
Well, 20 minutes later, the phone rings in the press box and they say,

[01:26:56.780 --> 01:26:59.040]
Harry Wendelstead wants to talk to you.

[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:00.200]
So he disappears.

[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:02.980]
And Steve Stone is, you know, filling the time.

[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:04.160]
It's terminal. It's boring.

[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:07.020]
And Harry comes back and he says, isn't that umpires?

[01:27:07.060 --> 01:27:08.280]
They're just like everybody else.

[01:27:08.420 --> 01:27:11.240]
You give them 1,000 free plugs for their umpiring school.

[01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:12.300]
They think they got it coming.

[01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:15.560]
You say one negative thing and right away, they're all over your case

[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:17.980]
and trying to intimidate you and carrying on like Mania.

[01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:19.400]
It was the funniest bit.

[01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:22.940]
If he wasn't in the tank that day, nobody ever has been, okay?

[01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:24.620]
Nobody ever has been.

[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:26.720]
Anyway, 12th, he's a butman.

[01:27:26.940 --> 01:27:28.340]
All right. Here's a mobile and he was.

[01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:29.700]
Hey, Neil.

[01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:30.380]
How you doing?

[01:27:30.700 --> 01:27:31.100]
Pretty good.

[01:27:31.180 --> 01:27:32.620]
First time caller, long time list.

[01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:34.800]
The only thing better than that was the rain delay the night,

[01:27:34.940 --> 01:27:38.340]
I think it was the night before the night after when Bill Murray was on with Harry.

[01:27:38.580 --> 01:27:40.180]
And it was just, it was incredible.

[01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:42.180]
He had Harry in stitches.

[01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:43.360]
Yes, sir.

[01:27:43.860 --> 01:27:45.060]
I'd like to welcome you back.

[01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:45.640]
Thank you.

[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:48.080]
Point of reference, the examinations that you took.

[01:27:48.260 --> 01:27:48.360]
Yeah.

[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:52.380]
As far as the stroke is concerned, that's an ultrasound for your carotid arteries.

[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:53.960]
Yeah. And for my heart, too.

[01:27:54.340 --> 01:27:55.560]
Well, that was an echo cardiogram.

[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:56.900]
Oh, excuse me.

[01:27:57.020 --> 01:28:00.440]
Well, anyway, they're in full color and they're, you see your heart in the hole,

[01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:01.380]
but it's really freaky.

[01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:02.080]
And it's interesting.

[01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:03.500]
And then while they're doing it.

[01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:04.080]
Yeah.

[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:04.960]
Oh, yeah.

[01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:06.020]
You see it right on the screen.

[01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:09.120]
And then with the arteries, not only do you see it in color,

[01:28:09.140 --> 01:28:12.080]
the blood going up into your brain, but you hear it.

[01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:14.060]
You hear the sound.

[01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:14.460]
Right.

[01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:15.040]
Right.

[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:16.020]
And every now and then we go.

[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:18.060]
And but I said, I explained them.

[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:18.860]
They understood what they were doing.

[01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:20.140]
Well, we don't have anything to do this afternoon.

[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:21.560]
Yeah, go over and have one.

[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:22.740]
No, I didn't.

[01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:27.080]
Listen, none of the tests I took bothered me except the, the, the, um,

[01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:28.680]
catskin with the eye of the eye.

[01:28:28.820 --> 01:28:29.000]
Yeah.

[01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:30.840]
That thing is a little bit.

[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:31.180]
Huh?

[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:31.920]
That kind of thing.

[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:32.980]
A little nauseous, man.

[01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:36.280]
And you can feel it going in the white parts of your body, which I can't mention on the air,

[01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:39.620]
but it goes all the way down there and up here and, you know,

[01:28:39.780 --> 01:28:40.900]
my wife does have for a living.

[01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:42.680]
What's that?

[01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:43.780]
Has those tests done on her?

[01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:44.120]
Oh, really?

[01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:46.760]
She gives her, or use the eye on what is X-ray?

[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:47.340]
Is she going to say this?

[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:48.120]
She's going to say this?

[01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:49.200]
Yeah, all of those things.

[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:50.000]
Yeah, no one will say this.

[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:50.860]
X-ray tech.

[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:53.080]
Yes, sir, go ahead, Payne, no attention to this, man.

[01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:54.260]
No, no, I, I, I understand.

[01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:57.040]
Um, no, I was listening to the, I was, he's on a power trip now.

[01:28:57.060 --> 01:28:58.320]
He's looking for everybody's job.

[01:28:58.660 --> 01:28:58.760]
Huh?

[01:28:59.260 --> 01:29:00.480]
When do you want to start, sir?

[01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:01.980]
Got a weekend opening for you?

[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:03.040]
No problem.

[01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:03.780]
I have a, I have a, too.

[01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:04.780]
No, no.

[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:07.060]
My line of work is ultrasound.

[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:10.560]
That's why I called you in because I remember, uh, weeks ago, when that, uh,

[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:11.300]
nurse called in.

[01:29:11.460 --> 01:29:11.600]
Yeah.

[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:16.220]
And, and she did make a point and she was, I, I thought so, uh, I thought what?

[01:29:16.460 --> 01:29:20.160]
I thought that you had a stroke because the symptoms that you were describing,

[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:21.100]
am I speaking to it?

[01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:22.180]
Well, you could hear my speech.

[01:29:22.300 --> 01:29:22.660]
That's correct.

[01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:26.680]
You know, and the arm was a real limp, not just the wrist, but the whole arm,

[01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:27.920]
and it was, you know, frightening.

[01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:28.840]
That's excellent.

[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:30.020]
I wish you the best meal, Anne.

[01:29:30.020 --> 01:29:30.960]
What do you mean that's excellent?

[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:32.940]
Why do you, now, somebody, you know, said that, too?

[01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:35.400]
You do know you made a miraculous recovery, you know?

[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:36.140]
What is that?

[01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:40.000]
Because everybody who I've talked to with many strokes, the common thread has been six months.

[01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:40.160]
Hello.

[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:41.360]
Six months.

[01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:42.540]
Yes, hang on, sir.

[01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:42.840]
Yeah.

[01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:44.280]
Six months.

[01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:45.100]
Six months, yes.

[01:29:45.620 --> 01:29:47.080]
I remember my care so good all of a sudden.

[01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:48.480]
You know, I think I might have to go home.

[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:49.340]
Okay, we're here.

[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:50.080]
Yeah.

[01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:51.000]
Well, it's good.

[01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:51.720]
What's going to happen?

[01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:52.140]
Yeah.

[01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:54.740]
Well, listen, thanks a lot, sir.

[01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:55.640]
It's okay, Neil.

[01:29:57.080 --> 01:29:57.720]
See ya.

[01:29:57.900 --> 01:29:58.400]
How do you know?

[01:29:58.500 --> 01:29:59.680]
Okay, well, that's, that's it.

[01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:01.040]
Is that, what was that?

[01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:02.800]
Was that the mobile, or am I losing my mind?

[01:30:02.900 --> 01:30:04.180]
He was mobile, didn't sound like you did?

[01:30:04.540 --> 01:30:04.720]
Yeah.

[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:05.240]
He was.

[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:06.300]
Yeah, it sounded like it.

[01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:07.420]
Here's, uh, Miramar.

[01:30:07.940 --> 01:30:08.620]
Yo, Neil.

[01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:09.100]
Yeah.

[01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:10.200]
Well, come back, man.

[01:30:10.340 --> 01:30:10.940]
Oh, thank you, Mon.

[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:12.160]
Hey, I tell you something.

[01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:12.600]
Hey, Pasa.

[01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:14.400]
Oh, I'm sorry, that's the raw, well, I don't know.

[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:14.800]
I'm confused.

[01:30:15.140 --> 01:30:15.440]
Hello.

[01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:15.900]
Yeah.

[01:30:16.380 --> 01:30:17.100]
You know, my aunt?

[01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:17.720]
You're in.

[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:18.780]
I'm with Neil, no.

[01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:19.260]
Yeah.

[01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:19.920]
Neil.

[01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:20.560]
You're with Neil.

[01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:21.880]
That's like, with child.

[01:30:23.660 --> 01:30:24.520]
Welcome back, man.

[01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:25.220]
Thank you, sir.

[01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:29.460]
I don't want to have a, I want to give Rick and Spots of Middleton for the good work that performed.

[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:30.460]
They were tremendous.

[01:30:30.780 --> 01:30:31.720]
You know, that's, that's come back.

[01:30:31.820 --> 01:30:32.140]
You look a bit too good.

[01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:33.040]
That's what Alex said.

[01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:34.540]
Yeah, they get rid of this come.

[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:35.880]
You won't hear him anymore.

[01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:36.540]
I know.

[01:30:36.860 --> 01:30:40.380]
I can't wait to tell him that on such an, you won't hear the hair lady anymore, sir.

[01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:40.920]
Yeah.

[01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:42.340]
No more Eric Lambert.

[01:30:42.580 --> 01:30:43.380]
I'm glad for that.

[01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:43.940]
Hey, Neil.

[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:46.940]
Hey, we can't put a stand out of this thing, you know.

[01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:47.860]
Put stand?

[01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:50.060]
We gotta put stand back in that talk like a while.

[01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:52.540]
Oh, yeah, you just lost all your favor with Rick and Puts.

[01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:53.060]
No, man.

[01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:54.920]
They just said you're number one.

[01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:56.520]
They said you're number one in Miramar.

[01:30:56.780 --> 01:30:58.340]
Hey, but there's still number one, man.

[01:30:58.540 --> 01:30:58.880]
Okay.

[01:30:59.180 --> 01:31:02.540]
But I want to see my pile stand up there.

[01:31:02.780 --> 01:31:03.080]
Okay.

[01:31:03.340 --> 01:31:03.560]
Hey.

[01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:04.560]
Well, he is up there.

[01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:05.020]
All right.

[01:31:05.020 --> 01:31:06.100]
And he ever gets down here.

[01:31:06.100 --> 01:31:06.920]
He'll be with us.

[01:31:06.940 --> 01:31:08.000]
All right, will you die?

[01:31:08.180 --> 01:31:09.940]
I'm telling my glad they get rid of that boy there.

[01:31:10.180 --> 01:31:10.940]
Okay, boy.

[01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:11.520]
All right.

[01:31:11.540 --> 01:31:11.880]
See you later.

[01:31:11.980 --> 01:31:12.240]
Good.

[01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:14.100]
It's a big time.

[01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:14.860]
What?

[01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:16.420]
He called me, boy first.

[01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:17.680]
I just want to clarify that.

[01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:18.600]
I'm not going to let that go.

[01:31:18.700 --> 01:31:18.960]
Okay.

[01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:22.480]
It's a tell your good friend stand a lighten up a little bit.

[01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:22.820]
Wow.

[01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:23.380]
What's he like?

[01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:24.620]
And he hates us.

[01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:25.300]
Oh, boy.

[01:31:25.700 --> 01:31:27.480]
One thing I like about this place, man.

[01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:28.720]
Everybody loves each other.

[01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:29.560]
Oh, we do.

[01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:30.640]
He hates you like.

[01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:32.220]
And we have more failures.

[01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:34.040]
Anytime our name is mentioned, that's all.

[01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:34.600]
Well, that's true.

[01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:39.660]
Well, so anyway, Deborah Martinez has the one o'clock W.

[01:31:39.860 --> 01:31:41.640]
I knew she's going out to the big time.

[01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:43.340]
She doesn't give a crap about any of us now.

[01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:44.180]
She's a superstar.

[01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:46.600]
And we'll come back with our big one to two hour.

[01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:48.160]
And then at two o'clock, we're going to have a draw.

[01:31:48.260 --> 01:31:49.120]
We'll pick one out of a hat.
