[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.720]
New kids on the block have been sweeping the country

[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.940]
a creppant recording artist old farts in the Congo with their new smash album friends and animals

[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:48.560]
We've been driving throughout the other day

[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.580]
but we found out it got the book of our lives

[00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.040]
so we found the crossing street

[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.080]
we walked across the road that a truck hit my wife when it squashed a like a crow

[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.180]
Old farts in the Congo

[00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.760]
Catch the tour by the album before they expire

[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.960]
I told you once I told you twice

[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.680]
No MSC on my farts

[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.300]
They raised the price on polygrap so I'm sorry I can't leave a tab

[00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.220]
First there were no kids on the block

[00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.900]
Now old farts in the Congo

[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.340]
I tell you my wife says just

[00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.540]
Old farts in the Congo

[00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.320]
My the album friends and animals

[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.060]

I hear you're a bastard

[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.680]

[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.520]
I W I O D on a very amazing day, Thursday

[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.060]
For those who keep track

[00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.260]
Wow, where do we start?

[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.580]
Can we take a couple of calls before I go into my big monologue?

[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.940]
Point and beach

[00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:46.680]
Good morning

[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.500]
Yes, sir

[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.640]
I got to tell you in the other morning I'm just pissed

[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.200]
Yeah

[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.920]
First of all I just got through watching Don and you

[00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.320]
Which brought me back to the fact of step and I listened to on w i o d last night on the news

[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.840]
Can I ask you a question?

[00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.220]
Yeah

[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.820]
Where is Paul Harvey?

[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.160]
I don't know. Where is he when you need him?

[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.900]
Oh jeez

[00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.920]
He's waiting to emotional

[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.080]

About the school board incident now

[00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:24.320]
Yeah

[00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.780]
And the reason he didn't get picked was because he was a black man

[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.600]
Are we going to go in?

[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.360]
Are we going to start this right out of the box?

[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:37.260]
No, sick of every time someone has got passed up or something that has become racial

[00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.460]
Right, that's big county for you sir

[00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.100]

Well, I've been I woke up years ago but no one no one says that anymore

[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.520]

Oh, is that the Palm Beach line?

[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:42.700]
Yes, ma'am

[00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.660]
Okay, I'm going from Jupiter

[00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.680]
The planet of the city

[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.920]
It's just a joke hold on a second, okay?

[00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.340]
Okay, you're going to be okay?

[00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:53.580]
Yeah, okay

[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.860]
All right, let's do another break because I want to get to some of these calls and I also will have a lot of comments to make

[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.660]
Because I was there the day the WNWS went on the air

[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.040]
Out of nowhere

[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.860]
Way back way back in 1978 in March of 78

[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:16.520]
Dick Casper, a genius in the broadcasting industry and they still haven't written anything about them either of our great newspapers

[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.540]
Man died a couple of months ago

[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:27.580]
Put about a half a dozen different successful formats on the year in the same market and other big formats and other major markets around the country didn't get one line

[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:35.500]
From our illustrious radio TV experts in this town and isn't it interesting my good friend Tom Jika who's going to be on with us next Tuesday all day

[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.480]
Is up in New York for the breeders cup at Belmont Saturday

[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.420]
So what does the Sun Sentinel have?

[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.860]
Nothing Zipini Duda

[00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.480]
When Jika's away let the herald play that's what they say at the Sun Sentinel

[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.300]
Isn't it some kind of a town

[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.380]
Made your breaking stories

[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.400]
Wow, we don't know about that time's up in New York

[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.320]
He's plunging his guts out at OTB

[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.960]

Neil Rogers, outrageous and unbelievable and Rick and Suds, crazy with a dash of dementia

[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.040]
Welcome to 610 WIOD

[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.160]
We're done

[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.340]
And as if we don't have enough traumatic stuff going on

[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:52.100]
And we also receive word through our rumor mongerline that WNN, the motivation station, the winners news network

[00:05:53.060 --> 00:06:00.040]
Has told its staff that it's dissolving the current format current staffers now calling around the market looking for work

[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.660]
What a business, huh? What a business

[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.660]
And in that old bag that called a Dicken Duddy yesterday afternoon I want to make one thing perfectly clear

[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.700]
Okay, get the wax out of your ears lady

[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.080]
We feel for our fellow broadcasters in their time of need, don't we?

[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.740]
Huh? We don't? Yes we do

[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:27.060]
Because we're for the talent, down with management they suck up with the talent

[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.300]
Now Alice is okay, he's getting paid off to next July

[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.240]
He can have one 12 time between now and then

[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.600]
And Debbie, she can live off the fat of the land for a long time, man

[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.460]
Don't worry about her, she's not going to miss any meals and if she does nobody will notice

[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:49.080]
What am I getting all emotional about? Well, it's quite an emotional day and as far as Sandy is concerned what is there to say but

[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:54.420]
Stink or even desert and don't give her a magic

[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.420]
You're a dancer

[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.040]
All right, don't get emotional again, okay calm down

[00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.380]
Well, there's so much to say we only got three and a half hours left to do it

[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.400]
Should we take that nice lady to call from Jupiter?

[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.180]
Hey, Neil

[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:12.400]
What happened on the lady that was on the phone? See, see what's going on on there? You didn't put another call on there, did you?

[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.660]
That's Mr. G, Big Al from Bocca

[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.020]
And he's got some old broad calling in there

[00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.520]
You're not pulling us anymore, Big Al

[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:23.860]
Miramar

[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.140]
I got a sparring force in the front handler

[00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.360]
Yes sir

[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.120]
Foxy, my name is Chris Leroy, Lazerino, he looks like a rhino

[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.460]
He was put, he was talking about Douglas and

[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:34.700]
Rhino Sandberg

[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.420]
Oh Chris Leroy, it says

[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:36.880]
Yeah

[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.440]
Anyway, he's talking about the fight tonight

[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.520]
What fight?

[00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:41.680]
What fight, okay

[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:47.580]
And he says Douglas reduced the square necked wrecking machine to being the butt of jokes like I fall and I can't get up

[00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:52.340]
You know that that woman was on this morning on the CBS Morning News, I forget what her name is Esther

[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:57.020]
Hello, Esther, I'm serious, the woman that's in the spot and she was lying on the floor

[00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:58.780]
That's how he said it though

[00:07:59.500 --> 00:07:59.940]
Unbelievable

[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.320]
He used your phrase, I fall and I can't get up

[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.560]
Well that's what Mr. Holyfield's going to be saying about the third round

[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.040]
Second round?

[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:07.380]
Yeah

[00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:08.400]
Okay, thank you

[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:16.060]
And as far as boxing kids concerned it's disgusting and barbaric and grotesque and I hate it, what channels are going to be on?

[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.100]
Okay, we have an open line, I know where it is

[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:21.620]
Trust me

[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:22.540]
Papano

[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:23.360]
Hello Neil

[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.060]
Yes sir

[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:27.060]
I was just so excited after reading a newspaper about every NWS

[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:27.920]
Yeah

[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.540]
I had to call in and just see if I was right

[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:30.860]
Are you dancing on their grave?

[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:31.780]
Yes I am

[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.400]
What you wanted to be

[00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:34.800]
C'mon you sir

[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:35.740]
Now listen baby

[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.440]
Can you see

[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:37.740]
Neil

[00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:41.160]
Don't, don't get to play Rudy Frudy to the hours

[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.940]
Come on, would we do a disgusting thing like that today?

[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.600]
Would that be in good taste or what?

[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:48.500]
Oh great taste

[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:55.480]
That would be one of the most disgusting, one of the lowest, one of the cruelest things that anyone in this business could ever do

[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.380]
I love it

[00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:04.820]
Go ahead

[00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:11.660]
And don't forget now, now that these jokes will be out of work, isn't it your duty to invite them in for a free meal?

[00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:12.400]
Yes sir

[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.580]
We're here to feed the unemployed

[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:18.400]
Can you imagine all the unemployed in this business, we have to rent a banquet hall

[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:24.060]
Firstly if Debbie came in we'd have to rent a gigantic banquet hall, we'd have to rent the orange bowl

[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.400]
At least, at least

[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:26.940]
Okay, well outside

[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.900]
They'll all come down on their feet sir except maybe Alice

[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:33.000]
Yeah and Jerry Wittner is going to be spending a record

[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.320]
Well actually they wanted to get rid of Wittner too but his wig is part of the lease for the building they got to keep it

[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.040]
So they figured he might as well have him along with it too

[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.900]
Have a great day sir

[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.000]
May the good snooze be yours

[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:49.580]
And if it sounds like some of us you see these guys in the afternoon my good friends a dick and dud

[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.680]
But now they're having a good time with this and I'm glad I gave them a whole show yesterday and again the day and tomorrow

[00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:58.060]
But the bottom line is you have to really have been on the inside

[00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:01.720]
Now I never worked thank god for Jefferson pilot broadcasting

[00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:07.440]
But that station was put on the air by a guy named Woody Sudburying, Sudbury Broadcasting

[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.500]
Not a great broadcaster to say the best

[00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:17.580]
But smart enough to hire a guy named Dick Casper used to be WFFUN, fun radio, big rock station back in the 50s and 60s

[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:27.540]
Then they started dying they had a bad signal problem, lousy engineers and the no audience and you could barely hear them and they were you know an AM rock radio went dead anyway

[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:36.300]
So they bought the station, shut it dead, deader than a door nail which they were supposed to do at WS News by the way until we let the cats out of the bag

[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.980]
And they shut it down for a month, they change the call letters from WFUN

[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.700]
What is this? What is this about?

[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.380]
The clap lady?

[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.140]
Oh excuse me, she's gonna be on with Steve a week from Monday

[00:10:52.800 --> 00:11:02.680]
But anyway and then we came on like in late March I think it was of 78 they hired me from KAT, they hired Stan Major, Mickey Dane, Jerry Wittster

[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:10.840]
And it was all news until late o'clock at night which was we had the Prescott Robinson and Jack McCoy and Steve Daley

[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:16.220]
And John Charles Daley and Arlene Frances and Bennett Sir and Dorothy Kill-Gallon

[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:26.940]
Well my memory is getting bad and then at 8 o'clock I was on 8 o'clock at midnight and Wichner was on midnight till 5am when the late Charlie campus was over there and Dick Casper

[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.940]
The late grade

[00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:37.500]
And the only numbers we started getting were at night 8 to midnight to 5 started getting to be pretty decent

[00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:43.840]
And then all of a sudden after about a year of puking with 0.1s and 0.3s trying to be WINZ with news

[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:50.420]
All of a sudden book comes out I got a 10-5 share at night and Wichner's got like an 80 billion share

[00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:58.500]
And so yours truly the fat man in his chair I went to lunch with Dick Casper several clandestine lunches

[00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.500]
And I said you're spinning your wheels, you're wasting your time, let's go all talk

[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:09.120]
Let's put Alice Rantell on full time in the midday and he said what I said yeah do it

[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:14.560]
And so we did news in the morning with Prescott Robinson and Steve Daley

[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:22.260]
We had Alice on from 10 to 2 stand major on I think at that time he was doing like 2 to 4

[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:27.240]
And then we did news from 4 to 6 and he came back and did 6 to 8 split shift I think

[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:33.000]
And then I was on 8 to midnight Wichner overnight and all of a sudden boom through the roof

[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:39.000]
And we went through a few years and Jerry Williams came along from WC working at the time

[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:44.160]
Somewhere in Boston not the BZ from wherever he was and Jerry Williams came down

[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:53.540]
And just had a we had like a 6 4 book in the spring in the fall was it in the fall of 81 I think

[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:59.120]
Well whatever it was gigantic then Jerry left him went back to Boston because he couldn't stand it here

[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.800]
And he was getting like practically he got mugged and practically murdered the night he was leaving town

[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:09.140]
I went over to INZ the station was bought by a man named Neil Rockoff

[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.560]
Rockoff what kind of a name is that?

[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.800]
Bizarre guy started destroying it

[00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.820]
Meanwhile Jefferson pilot buys old WGBS

[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.800]
Remember Arnie Warren and Amos?

[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:31.000]
Every now and then you see Arnie doing some spot on TV still poil wonderful time with that same phony crappy voice

[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:38.840]
And they buy WGBS to make a big talk station to compete with WS News at I.N.Z. 3 in the same market they bring in David Gold

[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:43.300]
Lee Fowler and embarrassing assortment of right wing douchebags plus Bev Smith

[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.520]
And who else was on there?

[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.020]
Barry Moses name?

[00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.540]
Barry something he's on Phoenix

[00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:57.740]
Well whatever they in no time at all they had like point three's and point five's destroyed

[00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:03.920]
And at that time WGBS had the best daytime signal of any AM station in this market

[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:10.480]
710 on the dial destroyed it ruined it

[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:17.840]
Throw it into the ground and competent with Dennis Collins and general manager and Lee Fowler as the operations mangler and embarrassment

[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.060]
So what did they do?

[00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:23.660]
They sell the 710 frequency to radio mom B

[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.640]
What are the callers W.A.Q.I. radio mom B?

[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.440]
No speak at the English

[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:35.580]
From Neil Rockoff the 790 Fawft the 790 frequency W.A.W.S. and they moved their talk operation over there

[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:42.660]
And they keep some of the old guys like Rantel and I think Shirley Peters at the time and whoever else and they move in Fowler

[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:46.100]
And a couple of other losers and keep wichin around at night

[00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:51.520]
And all of a sudden it starts getting older

[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.260]
And older

[00:14:53.260 --> 00:15:03.140]
And they got like all the old chronic talk callers and topics that have just like migrated to that spot on the dial and that part of this community

[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.580]
And they're giving away like Fel Dean

[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.800]
And what was the other stuff they were giving away those pills fiber one?

[00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:14.420]
I mean they made it into a geriatric station

[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:19.360]
And then all of a sudden they're saying, well I'd see we can't sell it businesses bad

[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.020]
What's wrong with a geriatric station?

[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:26.500]
What's wrong is that nobody wants to buy a station where the entire audience or the walking dead

[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.260]
They'd like to have at least a little balance

[00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.200]
At least a few people were still alive

[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.080]
Just one or two would be a good start

[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:37.440]
And so here we are

[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.780]
On this momentous day

[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:41.860]
October I'm a shooted to do this tomorrow

[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:43.500]
I'm wasting all of this and I want me to do it tomorrow

[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:44.160]
I'll repeat it

[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.000]
We'll just play the tape

[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:47.460]
And I'll sit around and gloat

[00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:52.400]
And it has nothing to do with the individual personalities over there as much crap as we like to give them

[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.140]
Because that's all Shobas, okay?

[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.560]
Some of those people I don't even know

[00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.460]
Market's done 21 points

[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.840]
But the bottom line is as far as that upper level management is concerned

[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:09.440]
And Jefferson pilot broadcasting even the sisters cringe when they think about them, okay?

[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:15.660]
They have now taken two of the major AM frequencies in this market and destroyed them

[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.620]
Had a cell one to bail out of that one

[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.040]
And now they're putting on the music of your life

[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.240]
Are you on AM?

[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.620]
It's like going back to the days of MLR, middle of the road

[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:28.840]
History

[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.800]
And of course we know they'll get some real good demographics with that, right?

[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:33.740]
Uh-huh

[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:37.940]
What the hell are they thinking about?

[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:45.220]
I think they want the parents of the people they have listening now to start tuning in

[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:51.380]
They'll have to bring them in bus loads from St. Petersburg and St. Augustine

[00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:52.180]
Uh-huh

[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:57.380]
You know the ones that will it Scott says hello to under the day show every morning or over the age of 190

[00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.540]
And shows the pictures of these rink-al-up prunes

[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:03.760]
Oh, here's a good looking guy up in the Skigen Michigan

[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:06.240]
Yeah

[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:15.520]
So get out the Polident and the Feldeen and the Metamusel and the Melox

[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.320]
Because we're going to put all his crap aside

[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.580]
We're going to start getting real serious on this station

[00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:20.780]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:22.520]
I guess

[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.360]
1037 at WIOD

[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:28.460]
We'll be back with the uh-haired doctor right after this

[00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:29.140]
Hi, Louie

[00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.480]
1040 at WIOD

[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:32.080]
What a day

[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.120]
Motivation station history

[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.840]
Talk on WS News

[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.220]
And what are what the callers are going to be?

[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:43.740]
Anyway, the original game plan was going to be that Alice and Debbie and Sandy and Jerry were going to come on

[00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:45.780]
He wasn't there this morning, was he?

[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:46.420]
Was he on?

[00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.420]
I didn't hear him

[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.300]
I was weak probably didn't come in in time

[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:55.180]
But anyway, they were going to be on tomorrow afternoon from 430 to 5 and did farewell

[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.740]
And then the station was going to go dark

[00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:00.220]
They were doing the Johnny Dark format for a week

[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:05.480]
And then a week from Monday, we're going to come back in their new format with their new call letters

[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.240]
Markets down 14 and a half points

[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.440]
But I guess because I'll be honest with you

[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.100]
You know Dennis Collins likes to blame me

[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.680]
Don't blame me like that stuff that came into mail the other day

[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:17.700]
Remember all those messages from Don Curran's phone message book?

[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.920]
What the hell have I got to do with that? It comes in an envelope from them in the mail

[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:22.440]
Like with a regular stamp

[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:27.460]
They got more leaks than a sieve, they got more leaks than the Titanic over there

[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.800]
And when the stuff comes out after all we are here to inform and entertain

[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.620]
But inform that's the bottom line

[00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:35.840]
When we get information, we know it's the MS

[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.480]
We're delighted, we're ecstatic

[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.620]
To be the first ones to share it with our wonderful audience

[00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:44.180]
Miami

[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:45.560]
How are you doing Neil?

[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:46.160]
Great

[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.800]
I was calling about that promo

[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:52.360]
Your IOD promo sounds like the Coast number two

[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.880]
Ah-ha, welcome to WI-SEAT

[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.000]
It's the wrong voice out there, it should be a much friendlier old voice

[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.400]
Like maybe the Dean would be good to record that

[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:06.600]
I mean it's like you have your own identity and it's the Coast, it's the West Coast now

[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:10.160]
I mean next thing you know you're going to play the same type of music

[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:11.980]
I don't know

[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.020]
I wanna be favorite

[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.660]
Hey they startle this dream

[00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:16.340]
Yeah

[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.880]
Well that's the boy Geary Syndrome sir, what can I tell you?

[00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:22.340]
Yeah well that's another thing about management huh?

[00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.000]
See first of all let me explain this to you

[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.280]
All the people who were listening over there who fly over here and have a sense of humor

[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:31.900]
Which I don't think will be too many and stick around, that's great, we welcome everybody

[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:36.100]
But the idea that suddenly all those geriatrics who were over there

[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:40.440]
How can I try to talk about the same old tired things to hear the sound of their voice

[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.100]
And using it as a babysitting service

[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.900]
The idea that that's going to be our audience God forbid

[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:48.360]
Really and that's exactly what they're implying with that

[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:48.860]
Yeah

[00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.640]
Welcome to IOD

[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.580]
You're a bastard

[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:53.880]
Yeah

[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.420]
Well anyway that's why the reason I called down

[00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:58.840]
Have no fear sir, this two shall pass

[00:19:58.840 --> 00:19:59.360]
Okay

[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:00.080]
Okay

[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.040]
Have a good day

[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:01.920]
Consider the source

[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:04.060]
1043

[00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:07.020]
At IOD we have an open line in data

[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:12.900]
I guess we should share with our new listeners those calling numbers because we want to give everybody an opportunity today to voice their opinion

[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:15.280]
This is America even in Broward County

[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:19.720]
Even if sheriff, you read the thing in the Sunsendless morning Sheriff Nick is very hurt

[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.900]
Can't understand why everybody's up at arms and they're all again him

[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:29.440]
I'm driving home yesterday, I'm on Flamingo Road and here's this pig on a, what is it?

[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.600]
No, wouldn't fit not today

[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.300]
Here's this pig on a bike

[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.920]
And he's following me all the way from 595 up to sunrise

[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:45.400]
Following me

[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:49.620]
And I'm going to speed limits 45 and I'm going 47, 48

[00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:54.340]
And I just keep coasting right along if I can say that with apologies to Wendy Bennett

[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:55.640]
coasting along

[00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.220]
At 47 or 48

[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.940]
And he follows me all the way up to the intersection I mean just incredible

[00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:04.320]
You're not fooling me Sheriff Nick okay?

[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:10.100]
In fact, it's nice having little police kind of boy home, little police protection on the way home every day

[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.240]
No problem at all okay? I'm driving real slow

[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:21.080]
Didn't we just do Miami on two? Didn't we just do that? For my losing my mind

[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:22.440]
Mobile on the star line

[00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:23.500]
Neil

[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:28.120]
Official dairy atrophy port from the snooze

[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:28.980]

Wait to hear this of course I'm coming up today so I had a little radio accident

[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:36.380]
Because the radio just tends to go in its own direction when I'm heading down here

[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:41.700]
And it goes over to snooze and they're all down there and they're climbing about where we're leaving the body

[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:45.040]
Can I, can I, can I, can I, I know, to that look in action

[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.420]

[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:13.360]

[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.500]
Because I didn't have my first album

[00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:14.500]

[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:16.040]

[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:16.960]

[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:17.300]
Like you're on vacation

[00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:24.240]
But I'm time, oh, and pushing just as hard as it can

[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:34.980]
And once they are seated, they get overheated

[00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:41.440]
As that stuff in the rolls and sweet and low in their beds

[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:49.440]
And they see, oh, waiting away again and go to the heart

[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.260]
Looking for that long lost power of you

[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:06.840]
And how did it say that it's the full of truth

[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:13.920]
It's a day, but for some, an enemy in the blues

[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:25.020]
Your folks don't know the reason why nothing is reason

[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:31.220]
The muscles ache and the teeth just don't fit

[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:42.560]
But what doesn't matter when they call up me and shout out

[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:48.700]
I hate you, you never listen to your show

[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:57.120]
Waiting away again and go to the heart of the dude

[00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:04.440]
Just to find the metham's and the radio

[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:14.820]
And how did it claim that it's the top hopes to play

[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:21.120]
But you know, they can't wait for your show

[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:42.840]
Even Cheryl's mom looks so

[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.160]
She's in mourning

[00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:48.260]
1055 and WIODA

[00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:50.900]
And a very solemn day in the radio business here in South Florida

[00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:50.960]
And a very solemn day in the radio business here in South Florida

[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:51.100]
And a very solemn day in the radio business here in South Florida

[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:55.640]
Yeah, and if it sounds like we're not as sorry as we should be

[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:57.940]
Guess what, Dennis? We're not

[00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:01.880]
Did they make any effort? Did they try to do something less geriatric?

[00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:04.720]
Did they make any effort to attract a younger audience?

[00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:11.120]
No, they kept encouraging the same geriatric old repetitive monotonous boring listeners

[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:14.080]
With the same old repetitive geriatric guests and topics

[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:19.360]
And they drove it like with a stake through Dracula's heart right into the ground, into the grave

[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:25.360]
So are we supposed to sit here? Oh gee, it's too bad that topical talk is dying

[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:30.720]
Yeah, well maybe if those stations that wanted to do it didn't end the way that was a little more interesting

[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.220]
And less geriatric

[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:41.020]
And stop discussing the same four things all over again like Sandy with her stinking bilingual as many illegal aliens by God

[00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:43.940]
If she ever fought it between that and casino gambling, that's it

[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:49.060]
You could start out by talking about the pigmies on the moon and within 30 minutes

[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:51.100]
She'd be talking about the fact they don't speak English

[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.160]
Miami, Buenos dias

[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:56.380]
Neil! Yes sir

[00:31:56.940 --> 00:32:03.740]
They're not only playing Beatles and other music that's terrible but they're, uh, they're only playing one side of the stereo

[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:07.240]
Like the left side? Well, what do you expect on AM mono sir?

[00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:08.980]
AM mono is one thing

[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:12.520]
Yeah, I think somebody over there's got mono is what the problem is

[00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:17.760]
You know what I'm saying? Yeah, and Jerry said he's saying

[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:20.860]
Yeah, Jerry's saying, you know, while the wig is in the context

[00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:22.700]
Well, back from WQAM day

[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:26.920]
Actually, they have the transmitter hooked up to his piece, that's why they got to keep it going

[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.560]
Well, he hasn't been out of a job since 1951 he said

[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:30.280]
That's right

[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:34.780]
Well, actually they did want him out and he had his breed case there when Dennis made the offer

[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:38.940]
And he reached in and pulled out that beautiful silver shiny 357 Magnum

[00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:41.440]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.860]
Yes, I do that

[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:44.600]
Kind of like Clint Eastwood Jr.

[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:45.400]
Hey Yahoo!

[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:46.540]
Who ya?

[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:48.480]
Back on you

[00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:51.360]
1058 at WIOD

[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.240]
Now wait till Jerry had to, they already know me and they hate me like poison anyway

[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:58.440]
But wait till that Jerry after guardians is introduced to my dear friends Rick and the suds

[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.460]
From 2 to 6 this afternoon

[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.100]
Couple of the finest goyam you'll ever meet

[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:04.220]
Excuse me

[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:07.400]
1058 here's a payphone in Deerfield

[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:09.340]
Hey, this is Glenn Deerfield

[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:10.660]
How you doing Glenn?

[00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:14.820]
Alright man, that was boring that last segment, whatever that card was

[00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:16.680]
Stop, kill me

[00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:17.380]
Boring

[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:21.160]
That's what this town is all about sir, that's why it was boring

[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.060]
You know it, I don't know how to do it

[00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:23.820]
This was a reflection of this community

[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:25.060]
I couldn't agree with you more in your list

[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:26.520]
Did you see Sally mid-s last night?

[00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:28.280]
I don't watch Sally mids after Pieda

[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.840]
I thought her head was spinning a million miles

[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.960]
My said vibrates when I turn on panels so

[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.360]
They had this segment they called to death to us part

[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:38.400]
It was about battered women, it was unbelievable

[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.740]
And she comes on and says listen

[00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:44.640]
She says don't let your children watch this next segment

[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.660]
And they let on into it and I mean they were shown pictures of women

[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:52.420]
It was unbelievable, her head was just popping and spinning and it was unbelievable

[00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:53.740]
What's Susan day on there?

[00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:57.740]
Boy that was really, I didn't want to go down for

[00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:00.940]
Dave and showed some like women's breasts all beat up and stuff

[00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:01.700]
It was unbelievable

[00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:02.780]
Oh I bet you like that

[00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:04.320]
No, not me sir

[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:05.200]
I sure

[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.680]
Listen, whatever you say Glenn

[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.240]
I love the way you ripped the management there

[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:10.220]
I know why now I had a friend

[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:12.460]
I won't mention his name, he worked in the newsroom, Shane Thomas

[00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:13.740]
But he was canned

[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.160]
Yeah, unbelievable

[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:19.600]
Another one that got screwed by the upper and middle level management jerk balls in radio

[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:24.600]
Maybe if he had dressed up once in a while and stayed coming up like a slime ball he'd still be here

[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:28.440]
Let me tell you about that one time you were mentioned with Elaine Antt or is down in Key West

[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.480]
And that thing happened to her, you know, you talked all about it

[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:33.800]
Well, you know, he was called in on that Monday real early

[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.440]
Like two hours before he was scheduled to come in

[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:37.000]
That's right

[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:37.860]
That's why I looked at him

[00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:38.960]
Don't nail the zazz boy

[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.340]
I don't know where you Jose

[00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:40.840]
See ya

[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:41.600]
Thank you

[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:42.580]
What is he talking about?

[00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:46.500]
Anyway Henry says enough of this nonsense, we got the really important news coming up

[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.720]
And if anybody can do the important news he can do it

[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:52.860]
Henry Barrow ladies and gentlemen the legend is on mine a man who does the news from the floor

[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:55.600]
And we'll be back with more at 1105

[00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:57.360]
Now please

[00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:00.440]
I'm here in the locker room of the San Francisco 49ers

[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:07.320]
Pulse is many of these players are fresh from the shower and appear to be pretty much buck naked

[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:12.820]
Joe Montana of course is quiet in his hands underwear as required by his endorsement deal

[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:13.760]
Isn't that right Joe?

[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.140]
That's correct Barbara

[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:18.760]
You know Joe I realize you're the world's premier quarterback and everything

[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:22.820]
But obviously you have the makings of a fabulous tight end

[00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:23.760]
I beg your pardon?

[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.540]
Joe, how do you feel about women reporters?

[00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:31.140]
What actually by Brad's I'm quite comfortable you know they've all been thoroughly professional

[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:33.260]
I have no problem talking to women in the locker room

[00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:36.180]
Are you sure that this is the locker room?

[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:39.000]
It looks more to me like the equipment room

[00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:40.600]
Yes, yeah

[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:41.420]
Tell me Joe

[00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:45.320]
If I made a pass at you, would there be a pass completion?

[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.400]
Well actually Barbara my wife

[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:48.820]
Oh well here come the guys now

[00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:51.620]

No penalty for a week or use the pants

[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:55.340]
I'll be the offense

[00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:57.900]
Yeah you'll face if I run me

[00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:58.900]

Yes sir

[00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:20.690]
I heard that news conference this morning and Sandy said

[00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:24.090]
That this market is losing major talent

[00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:27.530]
And then she paused for 10 seconds

[00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:29.170]
You mean the motivation statement going on?

[00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:31.150]
Yes she said she paused and she said

[00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:35.710]
What do I mean major talent if we're out of jobs that could we be major talent?

[00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:37.950]
Yeah right on Sandy

[00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:38.810]
Is that unbelievable?

[00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:39.850]

We get a problem the creaking is a terrible craze

[00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:39.850]

Do you stop it nothing and clean up the street

[00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:50.110]
Hey lady you can't cross here you'll have to cross the line

[00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:53.570]
And they determine the clean up the smuggling business

[00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:55.850]

I'm gonna have first time to see that wife stuff

[00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:06.670]

[00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:07.290]
Oh what?

[00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:11.010]
Sweet and low from that restaurant she just came out of

[00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:11.850]

[00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:17.450]

[00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:19.910]
In Helen Dale's vise

[00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:23.150]

[00:40:29.410 --> 00:40:35.010]

[00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:39.450]

I hope we don't cut out his incredible comments he's gonna have about the changes at W. Snow

[00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:49.850]
Things change in broadcasting

[00:40:49.850 --> 00:40:54.650]
Right 1115 at W. I. Old D and let's go to Fort Lauderdale

[00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:55.150]

Yes ma'am

[00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:57.930]
I had a radio accident this morning

[00:40:57.930 --> 00:41:00.330]
In between the tears

[00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:01.350]
Let me guess

[00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:08.730]
Yeah

[00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:12.750]
Alice called Debbie he felt like Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz

[00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:15.970]
Oh no

[00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:18.990]
Oh my god

[00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:22.810]
I had a run for the tissue box Neil it was so emotional

[00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:25.450]
That is

[00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:29.050]
I'm pretty pretty and I'm standing in the front row

[00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:33.410]
It's you know the song's best in the dark and the singing on the false band

[00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:36.070]
Okay I get emotional like you do

[00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:37.130]
Very sad Neil

[00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:37.890]
Wasn't it?

[00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:38.990]
Traumatic

[00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:41.270]
I couldn't stop the tears from flowing

[00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.710]
God

[00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:46.030]
And I love that BS that Dennis Collins comes on with their at 10 o'clock wasn't that the

[00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:46.910]
Did you hear that part?

[00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:47.870]
Which part was that?

[00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:53.550]
When he came on right at 10 and went through this whole thing about our loyal audience and we know you're there and that's the good news

[00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:57.190]
And the bad news is there aren't enough of you and we have to make a tough business decision

[00:41:57.190 --> 00:42:02.090]
In other words you say we're losing our ass we got this geriatric old audience that no sponsors will buy

[00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:07.610]
And we got it and of course we're going to do something something smart by putting on this geriatric old music that nobody will listen to

[00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:09.270]
And nobody will buy again because we're dumb

[00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:10.690]
That's what he said

[00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:11.950]
Okay Neil

[00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:15.570]
A music intensive geriatric piggy Lee and Johnny mattress

[00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:17.210]
I don't understand

[00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:20.870]
Oh I'm John, I'm John, I'm Mel Tormey, the gay gourmet

[00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:22.370]
I mean what are we talking about?

[00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:25.150]
I don't know, who listens to music on A and Neil?

[00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:29.710]
Nobody unless that's all they got, unless they're tone deaf

[00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:33.270]
You're not changing anything I hope with your new listeners

[00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:37.330]
That's what you think, just wait till I guess next week

[00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:38.950]
I kneel

[00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:41.710]
I've waned Daya to say I'm dying over here

[00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:42.310]
The doctor?

[00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:43.210]
Uh huh

[00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:45.450]
Every day a different doctor

[00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:46.550]
That's wonderful

[00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:47.350]
Uh huh

[00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:48.290]
I wish you were one of those

[00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:50.890]
And we have the Fel Dean ladies going to have her own show

[00:42:50.890 --> 00:42:53.050]
I want a full meal

[00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:55.050]
It's called hold on to what you all got

[00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:56.910]
I wish you're not a full meal

[00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:58.070]
Because it's in the bag

[00:42:58.070 --> 00:42:59.030]
See in soon

[00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.750]
Adios

[00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:03.970]
It's 1118 at WI-O-D

[00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:07.850]
Oh well listen what can I say

[00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:09.750]
Okay, we're not supposed to sound happy

[00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:11.850]
Because there's some real talents out of work today

[00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:13.670]
Of course none of them were working over there

[00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:15.650]
It's just a joke

[00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:17.390]
Don't take it personally, Alice and B

[00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:19.110]
Okay's getting paid off to lecture live

[00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:20.310]
A lot of us only wish

[00:43:20.850 --> 00:43:25.610]
We got into these deals where we get paid off the rest of a nice juicy contract for 475 an hour

[00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:28.010]
Let's try Miami, shall we?

[00:43:28.170 --> 00:43:28.630]
When is this?

[00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:30.050]
Good morning, Neil

[00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:32.830]
What do you think about bilingualism, Sir Archus, is it kinda of it?

[00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:34.810]
Uh if you hit the AM dial

[00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:37.950]
I think we're the last gringo station

[00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:38.590]
Yeah

[00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:42.210]
Let's get Sandy over here to talk about bilingualism, dammit

[00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:45.710]
Gringo, were you the only gringo station left on the dial, man?

[00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:46.410]
Yeah, hold

[00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:47.170]
That's it

[00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:48.350]
Listen, I love you

[00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:48.790]
You got it

[00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:50.210]
Your Arnold's commercial

[00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:53.970]
By the way, his way is Chuck Myers' birthday really on November 5th

[00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:55.530]
With somebody find out, I don't think that's true

[00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:56.310]
Somebody gave me some

[00:43:56.310 --> 00:43:58.370]
I know Cheryl's birthday is on November 5th

[00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:01.670]
And my birthday wouldn't be something if we had three people on the same stiff staff

[00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:03.910]
All of the birthday on the same day

[00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:04.970]
Incredible

[00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:05.590]
Wow

[00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:07.250]
Listen, I love your Arnold's commercial

[00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:10.590]
The people off the street, you said, they will enjoy the little burgers

[00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:12.590]
Yeah, those little burgers

[00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:13.650]
This street people

[00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:14.230]
Right

[00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:19.130]
On November 4th, I have an official, quote, official, official

[00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:21.890]
Tom-like-inspire report from LA

[00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:22.510]
Yeah

[00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:23.850]
Just cut back about two years

[00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:31.530]
Oh, oh, an honest, a W-K-F-I-A-M-640-A-M radio station

[00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:36.610]
We don't care about K-F-I because we own it and the sister station is the coast and billen about $80 billion

[00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:39.130]
And making lots of money with that slush and we love it

[00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:40.690]
Do you really own K-F-I?

[00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:42.230]
Is this a straight line?

[00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:44.870]
Well, I wouldn't say I own it, the sister's own it, how's that?

[00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:47.250]
Well, part of the show we say parent corporation

[00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:48.370]
The Shvestors, yeah

[00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:51.570]
Mr. Tom-like-inspire is on W-K-F-I from the street

[00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:54.250]
It's not W-K-F-I, it's west of the mid-pacific, sir

[00:44:55.890 --> 00:45:00.130]
And I couldn't even get on the line, because as soon as the guy found out I was from Miami hung up on me

[00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:00.530]
Why?

[00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:01.330]
Honest engine

[00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:02.870]
Well, what did you want to call him about?

[00:45:03.110 --> 00:45:04.570]
Just to say hi Tom

[00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:07.770]
Here it is, a live spy report from Miami

[00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:12.870]
He doesn't care, what are the people in LA care about the W-S-News in Miami?

[00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:13.850]
That's a fact Jack

[00:45:13.850 --> 00:45:20.990]
I have no life, that is a fact Jack, there is no way we were going to get on the air soon as I said a report from Miami, the guy didn't want to hear it here

[00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:23.390]
And you know what, if George would have been smart, he'd done the same thing

[00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:33.790]
Twenty after eleven at W-I-O-D we have an open line in D, now let's give these numbers slowly and clearly because I know that at least listening to those promos were running today those insipid idiotic promos

[00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:40.850]
We have just got billions, now it's going to take them a while because they have to crank that dial from 790 to 610

[00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:45.130]
And that's going to take a little while because most of them are in the prone position and they can't get it up

[00:45:45.130 --> 00:45:51.570]
But sooner or later when they finally lock it in we want to make sure that they have those numbers we want to give them a goal

[00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:54.050]
W-I-O-D George is on the bat line

[00:45:54.610 --> 00:45:58.330]
Yes, this is, I'm calling from Miami I'd like to talk to you

[00:45:58.330 --> 00:46:02.150]
Okay hold on sir, okay sir

[00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:08.590]
Yes, okay, like I said 21 past eleven at W-I-O-D now the fun returns okay

[00:46:08.590 --> 00:46:11.830]
Now we're going to get the meat and potatoes of the talk business back again right?

[00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:29.990]
Is the dipty about a bitty in my city not as old as that but you sure it's pretty old

[00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:33.810]
I tell you it's quite a bit deep, let's been on a low none, so just a tip

[00:46:34.310 --> 00:46:38.630]
She's not texting it's the true set up, walking by the door in her brand new get up

[00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:40.710]
She's ripped she falls she tries to go

[00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:45.570]
I fall and I can't get up, I fall and I can't get up

[00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:48.130]
Yo man didn't ask you in one time

[00:46:48.130 --> 00:46:52.850]
I'm in a chair, you know I was, yo yo yo yo me in the crew used to polo that blew her

[00:46:52.850 --> 00:46:56.610]
And now she's not allowed to dance, they drove her away in an ambulance

[00:46:56.610 --> 00:46:59.290]
Make it get to my shoes, make a big fuss

[00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:01.550]
I fall and I can't get up

[00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:05.530]
I fall and I can't get up

[00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:12.390]
Just keep in mind that it says old right-wing red necks so you still listen to W-Snow

[00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:16.410]
Those are the ones who vote in people like Nick Novaro year after year, decade after decade

[00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:17.730]
Just keep that in mind, okay?

[00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:22.990]
And now Mayor Crotch Cox says oh we wouldn't mind seeing all those students come back?

[00:47:23.290 --> 00:47:28.050]
Yeah, now that you're dying on the vine, you Yahoo, get a haircut

[00:47:29.310 --> 00:47:32.150]
It's 1126 at W-I-O-D, Boynton Beach

[00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:33.510]
Meadow! Yes sir

[00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:34.770]
They're dropping their flies

[00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:36.430]
They're dropping their fly

[00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:37.910]
They're dropping like flies

[00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:41.770]
Is the true Stan Major is coming back?

[00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:42.630]
No

[00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:43.330]
Just news?

[00:47:43.710 --> 00:47:43.990]
No

[00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:44.570]
I am radio

[00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:45.010]
No

[00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:46.630]
I heard he liked that

[00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:47.010]
No

[00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:49.330]
You know it's gonna benefit from this

[00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:50.190]
I'm listening

[00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:51.610]
Randy Martun

[00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:52.350]
Yeah

[00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:55.290]
Let's go to a fort-laughter day

[00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:56.610]
Let's say it isn't so

[00:47:56.610 --> 00:48:00.930]
Okay, just calm down, calm down, relax, Benny will be okay

[00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:02.470]
No more hell

[00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:06.610]
Oh Benny just relax, I'll pick you up for a little early bird

[00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:11.030]
We'll have some potato pull together and wash it down with some matsu ball soup, it'll be okay

[00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:12.610]
Just say it isn't so

[00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:16.830]
Hold on a second, when that collar gets their composure back, we'll put them back on

[00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:20.990]
We have an open line in Palm Beach, 655, Ancient

[00:48:21.730 --> 00:48:23.410]
655, Radio Death

[00:48:24.290 --> 00:48:25.330]
Oh jeez

[00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:27.970]
This is unbelievable

[00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:32.610]
I'm looking through you

[00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:34.570]
Where did you go?

[00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:37.950]
I thought I knew you

[00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:40.130]
What did I know?

[00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:43.970]
And we have an open line in Broward, 524, WIOD

[00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:45.690]
We know you're out there, come on

[00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:50.030]
Get it out of your system now, don't wait till us after the colonel's strangers, call right now

[00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:51.490]
I know you hate me like poison

[00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:53.150]
We know the ones we want to hear from

[00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:53.950]
Come on Esther

[00:48:54.450 --> 00:48:57.690]
Esther was on CBS Morning News this morning and I'm not making that up

[00:48:58.350 --> 00:49:00.510]
That's the I've fallen and I can't get up lady

[00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:06.810]
And it was interesting because they kept talking about the fact that this line has caught on all over the country

[00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:08.610]
But they never pointed out how

[00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:14.650]
That people laugh and hold their sides and fall down and can't get up from thinking about it

[00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:16.910]
They somehow didn't want to break the news to Esther

[00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:18.730]
For a long time

[00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:20.590]
Oh that's right, he's still there

[00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:21.910]
Mobile in Miami

[00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:26.910]
Dennis, come on

[00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:30.990]
Dennis, say to a station where they're listening, okay where there's an audience and they're still alive

[00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:32.190]
Come on, you can do it

[00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:36.830]
Dennis, check it out at the last second, I can't believe it

[00:49:36.830 --> 00:49:42.350]
Open line on a starline, star IOD for our Bell South Mability friend, that singular, Kendall

[00:49:43.310 --> 00:49:44.670]
I am very depressed

[00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:45.810]
Okay, here we go

[00:49:45.810 --> 00:49:46.830]
And I need your help

[00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:47.510]
Okay

[00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:51.370]
I'm sitting here drinking my coffee out of my W News mug

[00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:53.350]
And I am in morning

[00:49:54.050 --> 00:49:55.370]
Well, it still is morning

[00:49:56.410 --> 00:49:58.470]
Maybe a little music would make you feel better

[00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:10.650]
That's cool, let's stop being cool, let's have some feelings

[00:50:10.650 --> 00:50:12.650]
Let's stop being so callous to Alice

[00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:13.490]
Neil

[00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:14.570]
Yes

[00:50:14.570 --> 00:50:16.430]
I'm going through serious withdrawal

[00:50:18.130 --> 00:50:19.630]
What am I going to do?

[00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:22.010]
We're not going to be able to hear Sam anymore

[00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:23.110]
This is really

[00:50:23.110 --> 00:50:23.990]
Or Lou Feynman

[00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:30.790]
Or all those other chronic regulars that have been like part and parcel of talk radio in this town since before Muthusla was born

[00:50:30.790 --> 00:50:34.110]
Since before Elaine Ether's boyfriend was even an idea

[00:50:34.110 --> 00:50:36.110]
Well, I can't believe it really happened

[00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:37.990]
I first heard about it from you

[00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:39.970]
And I didn't believe you

[00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:40.750]
Why not?

[00:50:41.070 --> 00:50:44.550]
You didn't believe me, the voice of radio reason?

[00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:46.490]
This is disgusting

[00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:48.670]
It's grotesque, what the hell are we going to do?

[00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:51.850]
What is the Sandy Payton audience going to do between two and six?

[00:50:51.850 --> 00:50:55.590]
Oh, boy, they'll probably have to listen to Steve on FTL

[00:50:55.590 --> 00:50:57.970]
I'll have to all drive up to Fort Lauderdale and sit under the tower

[00:50:57.970 --> 00:51:00.090]
I have a little early bird out on the highway

[00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:01.570]
I'm dying on the air

[00:51:01.570 --> 00:51:03.910]
You got to promise me something

[00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:06.850]
It's like don't have my radio station anymore

[00:51:07.870 --> 00:51:10.250]
Please, don't talk so much sports

[00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:13.170]
Read us a couple of headlines from the newspaper

[00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:14.730]
I'm dying on the air

[00:51:14.730 --> 00:51:16.650]
Come on Neil, you know what I'm saying

[00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:17.650]
Here's the head, I'll wait a minute

[00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:22.870]
Immediate response, here's a headline from the South Florida section of the Miami Hero this morning

[00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:25.430]
It says, sources, WNWI has to drop talk

[00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:26.450]
There's a headline

[00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:28.770]
That's it, just put some more salt on the wounds

[00:51:28.770 --> 00:51:29.290]
Okay

[00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:30.610]
You know who this is, Neil

[00:51:30.610 --> 00:51:31.470]
Who is it?

[00:51:31.590 --> 00:51:31.930]
Yes

[00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:33.810]
Who is it?

[00:51:33.850 --> 00:51:34.890]
I talked to you yesterday

[00:51:34.890 --> 00:51:35.530]
Debbie?

[00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:36.330]
No

[00:51:36.330 --> 00:51:36.910]
Sandy?

[00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:38.210]
You got it

[00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:40.830]
You don't even sound the same, you sound like your whole life is like this

[00:51:40.830 --> 00:51:41.410]
I know, you're right

[00:51:41.410 --> 00:51:44.570]
Well, Gerald still will be there, old amusing, Gerald

[00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:46.930]
I'm serious, I stayed up all night

[00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:49.890]
When the minute they went to the Beatles, I knew

[00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:53.090]
Who's got Sammy Smith and help us make it, help me make it through the night

[00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:54.070]
That's the one we want

[00:51:54.070 --> 00:51:56.530]
We got to have Sammy Smith help me make it through the night

[00:51:56.530 --> 00:51:57.510]
You don't have it?

[00:51:57.790 --> 00:51:58.530]
No, we don't

[00:51:58.530 --> 00:51:59.430]
Who's got that record?

[00:51:59.590 --> 00:52:01.210]
We wanted immediately if not sooner

[00:52:03.130 --> 00:52:04.030]
I'm telling you

[00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:04.690]
We don't have it?

[00:52:04.830 --> 00:52:05.930]
They're not playing it on the coast

[00:52:06.610 --> 00:52:08.350]
No wonder they don't have a 10-year yet

[00:52:08.350 --> 00:52:10.770]
Come on, help me make it through the night by Sammy Smith

[00:52:10.770 --> 00:52:14.690]
Somebody in his, somebody over its specs, Joe or somebody we know has got that record

[00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:17.410]
We wanted on our air before 2 o'clock today or else

[00:52:17.410 --> 00:52:19.230]
Well, I hope it's their old audience

[00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:20.930]
Johnny dark, Johnny dark if you're listening

[00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:25.230]
Get on your horse and ride in here from a plantation, get it down here now

[00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:29.890]
I hope that old audience starts calling you Neil, I really do

[00:52:29.890 --> 00:52:33.950]
That old audience was that little play on words or just a toy and slip

[00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:35.350]
No, I didn't mean it in old sense

[00:52:35.350 --> 00:52:37.010]
His president Bush would say, read my slip

[00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:38.610]
Hey, I'm not a geriatrics

[00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:41.150]
I'm not, I'm not a fel being

[00:52:42.350 --> 00:52:43.590]
But I'm gonna be fine

[00:52:43.590 --> 00:52:45.070]
And you don't even have your teeth in a glass, do you?

[00:52:45.090 --> 00:52:46.590]
I need something today, that's for sure

[00:52:46.590 --> 00:52:50.210]
You do need something, well maybe your WhatsApp name will stop by and give it a little something

[00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:51.330]
Serious trauma

[00:52:51.330 --> 00:52:54.330]
Okay, now if we get help me make it through the night on that'll really do it for a moment

[00:52:54.330 --> 00:52:57.530]
Help me make it through this week, Neil, please I'm counting on you

[00:52:57.530 --> 00:52:59.230]
Okay, please

[00:52:59.230 --> 00:53:00.530]
Yeah, bye

[00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:01.150]
Why, boy

[00:53:01.550 --> 00:53:02.330]
Are you okay?

[00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:03.150]
I get this is soo

[00:53:03.690 --> 00:53:06.250]
Okay, hold on man, just a basket case

[00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:07.070]
Woo

[00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:08.390]
And Broward

[00:53:09.090 --> 00:53:11.290]
This town is never gonna be the same again

[00:53:13.350 --> 00:53:14.810]
Where's Paul Harvey?

[00:53:15.170 --> 00:53:18.410]
Where's the rest of my story on me?

[00:53:18.670 --> 00:53:20.870]
Where is he? You took him away again

[00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:26.390]
They don't give a damn about Alice or about Sandy or Debbie or Jerry

[00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:28.850]
All they wanna know is where's the more Harvey?

[00:53:29.650 --> 00:53:31.870]
That wonderful right wing douchebag

[00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:34.250]
Oh, excuse me, we don't say that anymore douchebag

[00:53:35.070 --> 00:53:37.930]
It's 11th or, now listen, it's time for us to clean up our act

[00:53:38.370 --> 00:53:41.870]
It's dark and a little more sophisticated, a little more topical, a little more worldly

[00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:46.070]
And solve the problems of the world, we got a financial crisis, the price of oil is going through the roof

[00:53:46.070 --> 00:53:49.450]
The gas stations are ripping us off, the Arabs are going nuts

[00:53:49.450 --> 00:53:52.670]
The Israelis and the Palestinians are killing each other like flies

[00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:55.910]
The President's a wimp, we can't even get that budget sooner

[00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:58.110]
And they're trying to stall until after the damn election

[00:53:58.110 --> 00:54:01.350]
We don't know what's up and what's down, we're having a recession

[00:54:01.350 --> 00:54:02.750]
Things are not good

[00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:07.630]
And we gotta talk about all those things and we will starting at two o'clock this afternoon

[00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:17.830]
It's 11th or 13th, at WIOD, we have an open line in Palm Beach County at 655 WIOD

[00:54:18.930 --> 00:54:23.170]
You don't look different but you have to

[00:54:23.170 --> 00:54:24.350]
That's 655

[00:54:24.350 --> 00:54:26.790]
I'm looking through the hills

[00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:27.250]
Nine

[00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:29.930]
Four, six, three

[00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:35.130]
You know that thing with the Beatles music, that is so old

[00:54:35.130 --> 00:54:42.050]
How many stations have done that? It's been done like a million times, every time a station is going to go off the air or change form or do something dramatic

[00:54:42.050 --> 00:54:46.810]
They threw on like 80 hours of Beatles music and you think you're listening to Zeta, you think it's the weekend, you know?

[00:54:47.470 --> 00:54:51.290]
Although I will say this, even though it sounded kind of muted and mushy, kind of like this

[00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:56.050]
Pete Boulder, can you learn a lot from that mix of Beatles music, they played this morning, not bad

[00:54:56.910 --> 00:55:02.170]
Sure beats the hell out of that crappy place on the weekend on Zeta, God talking about stations that are dying over there

[00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:03.390]
How you doing Pete?

[00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:04.870]
I'm dying over here

[00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:12.170]
It's 11-33-27 till noon at your prestigious news information sports talk and the stuff station 6-10

[00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:16.530]
WIOD, we will not talk sports ever again on the show, how about that fight tonight?

[00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:18.710]
The thing is believing and you

[00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:26.390]
I thought my career was through but then right out of the blue

[00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:30.390]
My new album is no one to do

[00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:33.210]
I guess my career is through

[00:55:33.210 --> 00:55:35.410]
I'm making more money

[00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:39.250]
My small numbering your honey

[00:55:39.250 --> 00:55:42.710]
Even more than John Lennon's honey

[00:55:43.390 --> 00:55:45.150]
But not more than Paul

[00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:49.150]
You know, don't think of this song

[00:55:49.150 --> 00:55:52.170]
You know, it's not too long

[00:55:52.170 --> 00:55:55.590]
It's such a recessive song

[00:55:55.590 --> 00:56:02.910]
You see what you see what you see what you see what you see what I see

[00:56:03.590 --> 00:56:07.370]
I caught my career was through

[00:56:07.370 --> 00:56:10.450]
I kept it with my crew

[00:56:10.450 --> 00:56:13.890]
You said to see this don't you

[00:56:13.890 --> 00:56:17.150]
So now my career is through

[00:56:18.070 --> 00:56:20.870]
I had some career roles

[00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:23.710]
But I don't have bring those no

[00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:26.870]
I guess I can't complain

[00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:30.730]
My song drives me insane

[00:56:31.710 --> 00:56:34.930]
You wish my career was through

[00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:38.170]
You're wishing this song was still

[00:56:38.170 --> 00:56:40.890]
It's nothing but strong proof

[00:56:40.890 --> 00:56:44.470]
I have a real low IQ

[00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:47.710]
Low IQ

[00:56:47.710 --> 00:56:47.870]
Low IQ

[00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:48.990]
Low IQ

[00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:52.370]
Low IQ

[00:56:52.370 --> 00:56:54.330]
My career was through

[00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:02.310]
We got it all today or what?

[00:57:02.450 --> 00:57:07.570]
Just tell me what your problem is

[00:57:07.570 --> 00:57:09.630]
Wasn't him, was it him?

[00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:11.890]
Why would he hang up?

[00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:16.710]
George unbelievable

[00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:19.050]
1138 at WID's there

[00:57:19.050 --> 00:57:20.470]
He's on the line

[00:57:21.610 --> 00:57:23.470]
It's the real Steve Kane

[00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:25.110]
I have a phone to pick with you

[00:57:25.650 --> 00:57:27.570]
I'm driving in my car

[00:57:28.070 --> 00:57:31.630]
Listening to an eloquent history delivered by yourself

[00:57:31.630 --> 00:57:33.430]
I left you out

[00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:34.890]
Well, it was a Freudian slip

[00:57:34.890 --> 00:57:39.190]
I thought they gave instructions you can't breathe my name or something

[00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:42.590]
Didn't, wasn't I the first one to tell everybody you're going to be on WFTL

[00:57:42.590 --> 00:57:44.130]
To the 6th starting a week from Monday?

[00:57:44.190 --> 00:57:44.890]
I got to admit it

[00:57:44.890 --> 00:57:48.190]
Didn't I tell everybody that I'm calling to tell you?

[00:57:48.190 --> 00:57:49.750]
I'm calling to tell you it's the truth

[00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:50.970]
And so help me God

[00:57:50.970 --> 00:57:55.350]
If Rick Ciderman is on your show the first day I'm going to barf on the air for four hours as a leading

[00:57:55.350 --> 00:57:58.670]
Now Rick will be on the second day

[00:57:59.730 --> 00:58:01.570]
You mentioned Mike Spindell

[00:58:01.570 --> 00:58:05.350]
You mentioned every also ran loser that ever worked at that station

[00:58:05.350 --> 00:58:07.690]
And you didn't mention one of the people that made it famous

[00:58:07.690 --> 00:58:08.930]
Did I mention Mike Thompson?

[00:58:10.010 --> 00:58:12.730]
Oh well so you didn't mention Mike so I'm a good company right?

[00:58:13.530 --> 00:58:15.990]
Is he going to be on with Rick Ciderman or Bob Coons?

[00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:16.850]
Let me ask you a question

[00:58:16.850 --> 00:58:19.030]
Are you brokenhearted WNWS1 out of business?

[00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:21.250]
I don't think I'm going to make it Steve

[00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:22.690]
You know what I'm going to miss the most?

[00:58:22.830 --> 00:58:23.290]
What's that?

[00:58:23.370 --> 00:58:24.270]
The Mike Thompson show

[00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:24.650]
Yeah

[00:58:25.470 --> 00:58:29.310]
How's this town going between Paul Harvey Mike Thompson and Rush Bingbang?

[00:58:29.450 --> 00:58:30.330]
What the hell are we going to do?

[00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:31.790]
I got to tell what we're going to do

[00:58:31.790 --> 00:58:34.030]
I really hurt moving under my feet like Harold King

[00:58:34.030 --> 00:58:36.770]
I feel a whole earth shifting just slightly to the left now

[00:58:36.770 --> 00:58:42.130]
Yeah, now you make sure you tell everybody that they have a real talk show to listen to in the afternoon's on FTL's

[00:58:42.130 --> 00:58:43.950]
I wouldn't go that far

[00:58:43.950 --> 00:58:47.650]
And with the price of gas most of us can't afford to drive that far out of the tower Steve

[00:58:47.650 --> 00:58:49.910]
Rick and SUDds are not up for it

[00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:54.310]
First of all Rick and SUDds and your audience are in two different planets on two different worlds

[00:58:54.310 --> 00:58:57.670]
Their audience is on Saturn and your audience is on Uranus

[00:58:57.670 --> 00:58:59.370]
It's a whole different bulging

[00:58:59.370 --> 00:59:02.350]
This is correct my audience has brains there's no question of it

[00:59:02.350 --> 00:59:04.230]
Well let's not get carried away

[00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:08.770]
Mr. Rogers I want to tell you that it's nice to talk to you or a true gentleman

[00:59:08.770 --> 00:59:11.630]
I know we're going to stay friends throughout this thing

[00:59:13.450 --> 00:59:16.630]
Oh you can just tell by the way he said that that he's up to his old trick

[00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:18.690]
Well you just no no no I'm telling you I'm not going to have to

[00:59:18.690 --> 00:59:22.370]
I just want to remind you I'll give you a great lead in from 10 to 2 and I'm sure that's what you had in mind

[00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:23.590]
There is no question of that

[00:59:23.590 --> 00:59:25.710]
I'm sure everybody will listen to what we're talking about

[00:59:25.710 --> 00:59:28.450]
Well listen Nick and Doug are my good buddies and they're doing a great job and they're kicking ass

[00:59:28.450 --> 00:59:32.750]
But those people who live over the two block radius under the tower there are more power to you

[00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:33.850]
What are you talking about?

[00:59:33.850 --> 00:59:34.830]
I'm not sitting in the block radius

[00:59:34.830 --> 00:59:35.810]
I've got to tell you that

[00:59:35.810 --> 00:59:37.710]
Are you going to be figuring out this good as yours?

[00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:38.350]
Yeah right

[00:59:38.350 --> 00:59:39.290]
There's no question

[00:59:39.290 --> 00:59:43.250]
Okay listen are you going to be sitting in the same chair that Ernie Sochin said in?

[00:59:44.010 --> 00:59:45.090]
You want to know the truth?

[00:59:45.250 --> 00:59:46.590]
That's the reason I took the job

[00:59:46.590 --> 00:59:47.850]
I don't blame it

[00:59:47.850 --> 00:59:50.190]
Not the same chair that Norman Kent said in

[00:59:50.190 --> 00:59:51.170]
Isn't that exciting?

[00:59:51.330 --> 00:59:54.070]
Oh my god, I'm going to be believable

[00:59:54.550 --> 00:59:56.870]
Steven Neal not together again isn't that great?

[00:59:57.030 --> 00:59:57.970]
Well what can I tell you?

[00:59:57.990 --> 00:59:58.990]
It'll be like the old age

[00:59:58.990 --> 00:59:59.630]
It'll be wonderful

[00:59:59.630 --> 01:00:01.850]
I got the whole list of guests already for the first time

[01:00:01.850 --> 01:00:02.630]
I know I keep it

[01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:04.610]
You're going to laugh at this but it's the truth

[01:00:04.610 --> 01:00:08.590]
As you were making jokes about who my first guest was going to be, I was taking notes

[01:00:08.590 --> 01:00:09.590]
I'm sure it worked

[01:00:09.590 --> 01:00:10.290]
That's a great idea

[01:00:10.290 --> 01:00:13.570]
Save the year-end lady for Fridays so we can take a lot of diuretics all week

[01:00:13.570 --> 01:00:17.330]
I don't know, I think that show is more of a reconfaction that is these kids show

[01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:18.430]
Now that I think about it

[01:00:18.430 --> 01:00:21.290]
Yeah well as a matter of fact they left the jug on the table from yesterday

[01:00:21.830 --> 01:00:22.930]
Steve good luck to you

[01:00:22.930 --> 01:00:26.130]
It's wonderful that we got a few real people back on the year again

[01:00:26.130 --> 01:00:27.450]
Starting on the mid-new day

[01:00:27.450 --> 01:00:30.690]
Newer clock WFTL 1400 on your AM dial

[01:00:30.690 --> 01:00:31.250]
Now listen to it

[01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:32.390]
My best to mic Disney, alright?

[01:00:32.490 --> 01:00:36.130]
Debbie comes by to apply all I would say is you evacuate the building immediately

[01:00:36.130 --> 01:00:37.190]
Take care guys

[01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.710]
See you Steve

[01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:38.450]
Wow

[01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:39.990]
Unbelievable

[01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:45.630]
Just tell me what your problem is

[01:00:46.210 --> 01:00:47.810]
Boy what a day huh?

[01:00:48.790 --> 01:00:52.030]
Thank god lunch from the unicorn is coming before you can say Jack

[01:00:55.230 --> 01:00:57.510]
What are you panicking about?

[01:00:57.890 --> 01:00:59.570]
I thought I knew you

[01:00:59.570 --> 01:01:00.450]
Boy are these people nervous?

[01:01:00.730 --> 01:01:02.010]
What did I know?

[01:01:04.570 --> 01:01:08.730]
Keep everybody on their toes, that's my philosophy, keep them on their toes

[01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:11.230]
WIOD, Georgia's in a coma

[01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:13.850]
Yes sir

[01:01:13.850 --> 01:01:15.130]
Holding for our meal

[01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:15.870]
You're holding?

[01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:17.070]
This is you

[01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:18.190]
This is I

[01:01:18.190 --> 01:01:19.190]
This is I

[01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:24.330]
This is me and I we just had the world famous mr. Canon yeah, that's pretty good

[01:01:24.330 --> 01:01:28.390]
I'm gonna admit having him on here's a little bit of fun, you know, it's like having a hemorrhidectomy

[01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:31.590]
Sure, I'm glad I'm following him right I'm like taking it off

[01:01:31.590 --> 01:01:35.470]
Uh-huh, hey listen. I don't think you're much of a big fight fan. Are you no?

[01:01:35.830 --> 01:01:39.250]
You're not so you don't care who pumbles the hell I do have a satellite dish

[01:01:39.250 --> 01:01:43.910]
And I'd like to see a buster Douglas beat the crap out of this baker just because for the hell of it

[01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:47.450]
Hey, yeah, man, everybody like downing the big man

[01:01:47.970 --> 01:01:51.550]
Oh my god, he's gonna beat the crap out of me. He's gonna send him into the moon

[01:01:51.550 --> 01:01:55.230]
He's gonna send him to orbit. He'll wind up. He'll wake up tomorrow morning next to Uranus

[01:01:55.230 --> 01:01:58.530]
No, I know he'll be more like recovering down in century village

[01:01:58.530 --> 01:02:03.590]
Uh-huh resting after they're gonna have to be giving a massive dose of felding just to get him up out

[01:02:03.590 --> 01:02:06.910]
You know what he's gonna say in the third round I fall in and I can't get up

[01:02:07.930 --> 01:02:12.110]
White yes, sir. Oh, that's great. Well, I'm glad you're here for the big buster

[01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:17.090]
Well some of us have a satellite dish will be watching knots landing taping the fighter of vice versa

[01:02:17.090 --> 01:02:21.010]
It'll be great. Hey, I'm paying for paying for view 3995

[01:02:21.010 --> 01:02:26.390]
You're used to paying for it pal. Yeah, we can all relate to it. All right, man. Have a good day and the same to you

[01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:28.610]
All right, no more sports. Okay, okay

[01:02:28.610 --> 01:02:31.590]
Hi, everybody. This is safety office of Mike Tyson heavyweight champ of the world

[01:02:31.590 --> 01:02:36.510]
You've had a suit around the baddest driver around to with your driving tip of the day a few months ago

[01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:39.950]
I was in the K-Mart with my ex-wife who I haven't given so I can't believe it

[01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:41.750]
Maybe you read about her in the papers anyway

[01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:44.450]
She buys me one of these cute little goffields cats with

[01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:48.290]
suction cup feet which they stuck on the window in my car when we left the store

[01:02:48.990 --> 01:02:52.550]
On the way home I drove into a tree. I can't believe it. Maybe you read about it in the papers

[01:02:52.550 --> 01:02:58.470]
I couldn't see the tree because the damn cat was in my way Robin said that I was stupid to stick garfield on the windshield

[01:02:59.090 --> 01:03:00.970]
I mean that that's really bitchy to me

[01:03:00.970 --> 01:03:03.870]
I mean call the heavyweight champ of the world stupid now that's stupid

[01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:06.370]
So I faked I faked Robin all left it

[01:03:06.370 --> 01:03:09.350]
I took her out with a clean right hand knocked it right down completely first

[01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:12.970]
Standing a count I can't believe it. Maybe you read about that in the papers

[01:03:12.970 --> 01:03:18.790]
Anyway, my attitude to a garfield the cat has really been affected greatly. I mean in fact if I see you driving around with

[01:03:18.790 --> 01:03:19.830]
Garfield the cat in your car

[01:03:19.830 --> 01:03:22.190]
I made loose complete control. I don't know what'll happen

[01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:24.070]
Maybe you'll read about that in the papers too

[01:03:24.070 --> 01:03:29.430]
Just tell me what your problem is

[01:03:30.270 --> 01:03:36.490]
1145 at W.I.D. want me great Rick Ciderman back on the air and the urine lady and Bob Kuhnst and Ellis Ruben and

[01:03:37.390 --> 01:03:42.410]
Reverend Rick Patterson and who's that the unique Reverend? What was his name? I can't remember his name. He was great

[01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:43.770]
Reverend

[01:03:45.610 --> 01:03:46.010]
Bag

[01:03:47.530 --> 01:03:50.210]
Anyway, let's go to a beautiful caller in Fort Lauderdale

[01:03:59.010 --> 01:04:03.750]
Hold on a second. Just to keep him on air till he comes down. We do have an open line in Palm Beach

[01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:08.850]
655 Beetle. Oh, I bet your Ricky Tickie is just eating his cap for breakfast this morning

[01:04:08.850 --> 01:04:12.450]
Can you imagine him go and nuts here and all that beetle music on another station man?

[01:04:12.970 --> 01:04:17.050]
I bet he panicked all beetles all day. I'll be honest with it. That wouldn't be a bad format

[01:04:17.050 --> 01:04:21.070]
I bet you they get a higher number with that that they're gonna with Peggy Lee and Johnny mattress

[01:04:22.490 --> 01:04:22.970]
Davey

[01:04:24.030 --> 01:04:24.770]
He said

[01:04:26.090 --> 01:04:28.430]
And there's nobody there. What oh?

[01:04:28.890 --> 01:04:38.270]
Excuse me. Oh excuse me. That's okay one thing the lady from coconut grove and I have in common is that the lady from the grove

[01:04:38.270 --> 01:04:41.370]
Which one who's the lady from the grove? I was lady was drinking coffee

[01:04:43.250 --> 01:04:50.270]
The lady that's drinking coffee. Yes, who's missing like oh, oh, I'm sorry. Well, I'm under such pressure

[01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:53.610]
I just talked to the famous Steve can I'm under a lot of pressure. Oh, I remember him

[01:04:53.610 --> 01:04:57.710]
He's the one who got me involved with talk radio and the great what a guy

[01:04:57.710 --> 01:05:03.690]
And then I started to listen to you and Barbara stuttley and Mike seagull. Oh, God those memories

[01:05:03.690 --> 01:05:09.310]
The Steve came and I started listening to our end-tope and I started to listen to you. Uh-huh

[01:05:09.310 --> 01:05:10.090]
Mm-hmm

[01:05:11.690 --> 01:05:15.950]
And John levin how could we leave John levin out of all of this the original?

[01:05:18.030 --> 01:05:23.030]
Right God knows that's right 24 and a half points of markets down not too bad

[01:05:23.030 --> 01:05:30.550]
Yeah, but anyway, I you know, I'm gonna miss that radio. It's nice to flip back on force. It's nice to flip

[01:05:31.550 --> 01:05:33.290]
That's what flipper always said

[01:05:33.290 --> 01:05:36.470]
Well, I suppose that's what Luke Helping you it's awesome. Yeah

[01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:39.850]
So anyway, it's just

[01:05:39.850 --> 01:05:43.550]
This is of course you don't have a book in competition with you now

[01:05:44.330 --> 01:05:47.690]
Well, we didn't have any before see it's funny you should mention that cuz during that time

[01:05:47.690 --> 01:05:51.250]
You said they were all geriatric side I beg to differ well most

[01:05:52.270 --> 01:05:54.130]
Pardon 98%

[01:05:54.130 --> 01:05:58.550]
I don't think so. Uh-huh. Maybe at night trust me

[01:05:59.430 --> 01:06:04.210]
Really anyway, what's good about good radio is when you have good competition and we didn't have any

[01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:10.170]
So the idea that it's great that there's nobody else to in talk is not good, but you know, I know that sounds bad, but it's true

[01:06:10.930 --> 01:06:14.530]
When there's good competition it makes for a healthier radio market

[01:06:14.530 --> 01:06:17.390]
I get more letters and it's more I mean I know

[01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:23.170]
I'm not a morning now and a morning is like just I mean wake up to Charlie Mato's

[01:06:23.170 --> 01:06:24.970]
Oh my god with that silly

[01:06:25.590 --> 01:06:27.090]

Be nice to the bird lady on the beach. She's a wonderful lady and she's over there with

Moishi or whatever that bird's name is and having a great time. Is he Rick and Todd's want the bird lady for the funeral

[01:08:07.970 --> 01:08:08.550]
Precession

[01:08:09.550 --> 01:08:12.350]
To do what I to interpret the

[01:08:12.350 --> 01:08:20.510]
Eulogy I guess Rick and suds are gonna turn this into some disgusting grotesque display of ill tempered bad-mannered foul crap

[01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:24.250]
Is that what you're saying? The absolute bad taste that they always work and it'll be great excellent

[01:08:24.990 --> 01:08:30.530]
And so they want you to like holler for the bird lady and if for all hymers hasn't kicked in far enough

[01:08:30.530 --> 01:08:33.110]
Where she can remember calling you yet? She didn't want to come over here

[01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:36.410]
She wanted to bring her bird over here and I said I got your bird right over here honey

[01:08:36.410 --> 01:08:41.350]
That's what I told her and she just fell on the floor and she still hasn't gotten up. She was on the CBS morning news this morning

[01:08:41.890 --> 01:08:46.390]
What that is a door nailed begging for your real parmesan her name is Esther. Yeah

[01:08:47.650 --> 01:08:50.730]
But Rick and suds really would like her for this Eulogy

[01:08:50.730 --> 01:08:53.650]
Okay, we'll work on it sir. I'll do my day and this okay

[01:08:53.650 --> 01:08:57.150]
I'm gonna put out some feelers for Esther. Yeah, there you go and the bird

Here's the true story of Ed D a guy who appeared on national TV because his car was stolen and then recovered the same

[01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:27.470]
Stinking day by the pigs using low jack trackers. How do you like that now like most of us

[01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:32.250]
I thought that his car would never be stolen but one night he parked it parked his car next morning gone

[01:09:32.710 --> 01:09:37.330]
Well, it wasn't a lot because his car was equipped with low jack the stolen vehicle recovery system

[01:09:37.330 --> 01:09:42.370]
He called the pigs at 742 in the a.m. By 945 the same morning

[01:09:42.370 --> 01:09:47.550]
The pigs using low jack trackers found the car hidden on a side street just a few miles away

[01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:51.430]
The thieves were letting the car cool off before stripping it for parts

[01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:57.110]
Coincidentally a producer from the ABC news broadcast 2020 was in the area waiting to film a live low jack recovery

[01:09:57.110 --> 01:10:05.010]
The 2020 crew appeared on the scene right behind the pigs millions of 2020 viewers saw Ed say low jack is outstanding a great investment

[01:10:05.010 --> 01:10:10.590]
I'm tickled pink that I bought a low jack and you'll be tickled too because it just makes all the sense in the world

[01:10:10.590 --> 01:10:16.530]

This means it's big outside

This is Jack and Miami Beach

[01:21:13.570 --> 01:21:16.570]
How are we going to survive without Jack from Miami Beach

[01:21:16.570 --> 01:21:19.650]
Without Lou Feynman from the Magic City Cat Club

[01:21:19.650 --> 01:21:21.470]
The man talks every issue you know what I mean

[01:21:21.470 --> 01:21:22.170]
Yes sir

[01:21:22.170 --> 01:21:24.170]
Let me ask you a couple questions about

[01:21:24.170 --> 01:21:25.210]
A lot of lovely lady

[01:21:26.330 --> 01:21:28.530]
I'm kinda happy because all those good

[01:21:29.390 --> 01:21:31.290]
talent that's how to work for so long

[01:21:31.290 --> 01:21:33.250]
Like your friends stand and cry and

[01:21:33.250 --> 01:21:34.050]
And Bill

[01:21:34.050 --> 01:21:34.950]
Yeah Bill

[01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:38.110]
And these other people have been out of work for so long

[01:21:38.690 --> 01:21:39.210]
That's a good thing

[01:21:39.210 --> 01:21:41.650]
You know I was wondering what was going on with NWS

[01:21:41.650 --> 01:21:43.230]
We're on a week talent

[01:21:43.230 --> 01:21:45.250]
So now they can all do it

[01:21:45.250 --> 01:21:48.830]
Maybe that's why they disappear because they didn't have enough brains to put some real talent on

[01:21:48.830 --> 01:21:51.550]
I mean Alice is okay if he's doing his own thing

[01:21:51.550 --> 01:21:53.370]
And it's a time of day when people listen to it

[01:21:53.370 --> 01:21:54.030]
Yeah I might be out

[01:21:54.030 --> 01:21:55.590]
And he doesn't take himself so seriously

[01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:58.110]
But the rest of that crowd forget it

[01:21:58.110 --> 01:21:58.790]
There is a question

[01:21:58.790 --> 01:22:01.690]
And that cadant said he had Debbie Ellis

[01:22:01.690 --> 01:22:03.450]
Oh I mean who are we kidding okay

[01:22:03.450 --> 01:22:05.210]
Okay to a Swiss the topic a week

[01:22:10.410 --> 01:22:13.690]
Are you gonna be head out to the hand box to watch the cup?

[01:22:13.810 --> 01:22:14.250]
No sir

[01:22:14.250 --> 01:22:17.130]
Never again read my slip never again

[01:22:17.130 --> 01:22:18.230]
Not even the readers

[01:22:18.230 --> 01:22:20.370]
I wouldn't care if they had the breeder's cup

[01:22:20.370 --> 01:22:22.910]
And if they had the micanzalas cup

[01:22:22.910 --> 01:22:25.170]
Okay I'm not going out there under any circumstances

[01:22:25.170 --> 01:22:26.370]
I'll wait till Gulfstream

Okay sounds good

[01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:32.050]
Plunge in our brains out

Jack from the beach may make a return

[01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:43.410]
But I doubt it

[01:22:43.410 --> 01:22:46.170]
He used to call me when I was on those geriatric stations

[01:22:46.670 --> 01:22:49.550]

Boy you know talk about a classic example

[01:23:01.490 --> 01:23:04.690]
Of fixing something that wasn't broke

[01:23:06.050 --> 01:23:06.490]
WNWS

[01:23:06.490 --> 01:23:08.190]
What a tragic

[01:23:08.630 --> 01:23:09.450]
It's tragic

[01:23:09.450 --> 01:23:10.470]
Just tragic

[01:23:12.350 --> 01:23:12.790]
Yeah

[01:23:12.790 --> 01:23:14.970]
And while they're not playing Beatles I think you're in the sub

[01:23:14.970 --> 01:23:17.510]
No you know I remember when that station went on the air

[01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:18.930]
You said listen to Drew Hayes

[01:23:19.490 --> 01:23:23.910]

Durkays

[01:23:25.190 --> 01:23:26.130]
Isn't that amazing?

[01:23:26.330 --> 01:23:29.410]
Well you know this is that's what's so perplexing about the whole thing

[01:23:29.410 --> 01:23:31.830]
I use that WNWS on my car

[01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:33.110]
And in my house

[01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:35.130]
From morning till night

[01:23:35.130 --> 01:23:38.050]
Is it that it doubles 8 to 12 and 8 to midnight?

[01:23:38.830 --> 01:23:40.630]
What's going to happen with Harvey from Kendall?

[01:23:41.010 --> 01:23:41.550]
I don't know

[01:23:41.550 --> 01:23:42.530]
Oh boy

[01:23:42.530 --> 01:23:43.990]
That station used to be so good

[01:23:43.990 --> 01:23:45.830]
I can't believe that they're out of business

[01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:47.050]
I just can't believe it

[01:23:47.050 --> 01:23:48.550]
What used to be is like the ancient

[01:23:48.550 --> 01:23:50.490]
They screwed up everything on there

[01:23:50.490 --> 01:23:51.530]
They had some of the best

[01:23:51.530 --> 01:23:53.810]
That's why I play in Sammy Davis used to be good you know

[01:23:53.810 --> 01:23:54.810]
Oh man

[01:23:54.810 --> 01:23:55.870]
They had you in the morning

[01:23:55.870 --> 01:23:57.610]
Then they had Al, then they had Steve

[01:23:57.610 --> 01:23:59.730]
Then even had Shirley Peters

[01:23:59.730 --> 01:24:01.590]
Oh I left Shirley out I'm sorry

[01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:04.510]
Yeah and I feel as a lovely person a wonderful lady

[01:24:04.510 --> 01:24:05.570]
She loves the unicorn

[01:24:05.570 --> 01:24:07.030]
Yeah what's your name Barbara?

[01:24:07.250 --> 01:24:09.610]
Well it's her militant for some of us but a wonderful person

[01:24:09.610 --> 01:24:11.610]

[01:24:11.610 --> 01:24:13.530]

[01:24:18.810 --> 01:24:20.150]
What was that guy that did overnight?

[01:24:20.550 --> 01:24:22.450]
What do you mean what was the guy that did overnight with?

[01:24:22.530 --> 01:24:23.910]
I don't know who to actual moron

[01:24:24.590 --> 01:24:26.470]
Witchner is a pseudo intellectual moron

[01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:27.830]
Not Jerry Witchner

[01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:32.810]
Oh, the other guy that was on Channel 17

[01:24:32.810 --> 01:24:35.510]
Oh, the wicked web, don web

[01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:38.710]
What a wicked web we weave when we go on the air right?

[01:24:38.910 --> 01:24:40.170]
Yeah all those people man

[01:24:40.170 --> 01:24:42.790]
With his royes the Taurus

[01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:45.450]
Hey, I always meant to ask you a question

[01:24:45.450 --> 01:24:45.790]
Yes sir

[01:24:45.790 --> 01:24:48.270]
How in the world did you ever do two shifts today?

[01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:49.510]
Not easy

[01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:52.630]
And then when I was doing nine to noon and ten to midnight

[01:24:52.630 --> 01:24:55.350]
For just a brief time and for no extra money either

[01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:59.270]
Yeah, I just mentioned that one time and Dick Casper jumped right on

[01:24:59.270 --> 01:25:01.630]
He said boy that's a great idea let's start Monday

[01:25:01.630 --> 01:25:04.030]
What you do between 12 and 10?

[01:25:04.270 --> 01:25:04.710]
Slip

[01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:05.990]
Good heaven

[01:25:06.610 --> 01:25:08.970]
Anyway, may they rest in peace it's the shame

[01:25:08.970 --> 01:25:10.630]
But what are you going to do?

[01:25:11.050 --> 01:25:12.670]
You know management never sleeps right?

[01:25:12.730 --> 01:25:16.370]
Well we're getting a minion together going to have a big thing tomorrow for him and give him a good send off

[01:25:16.370 --> 01:25:17.210]
Well send it

[01:25:17.210 --> 01:25:18.370]
May they rest in purgatory

[01:25:18.370 --> 01:25:19.010]
Yes sir

[01:25:19.010 --> 01:25:19.490]
See you

[01:25:20.350 --> 01:25:23.150]
1213 while we're sure you're dying to hear from Harvey of Kendall

[01:25:23.550 --> 01:25:27.010]

[01:25:27.810 --> 01:25:31.190]
Then there's Irving from homestead we want to make sure we get him on another chronic

I've forgotten so many of the chronic but the voices I still know I heard them in my sleep they're same

[01:25:36.490 --> 01:25:37.970]

And Sandy?

[01:26:06.090 --> 01:26:10.670]
Well wouldn't Sandy be shocked to see these lovely new studios for that lovely lady?

[01:26:10.690 --> 01:26:13.390]
How come everybody around here who worked with her said Sandy was a bitch?

[01:26:13.610 --> 01:26:14.530]
Why do you people say that?

[01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:17.650]

[01:27:18.990 --> 01:27:21.490]
Okay, wait a minute, give me some milk, give me some milk

[01:27:24.610 --> 01:27:27.990]
Don't talk about Lynnette, wait Cheryl, 20 after noon at WIOD

[01:27:28.570 --> 01:27:34.370]
On just a traumatic day, unicorn village is here with an incredible feast, little carrot cake there for a little later on

[01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:37.750]
Look at Mitch looking at you today, why don't you cook for your husband Cheryl?

[01:27:37.890 --> 01:27:40.030]
Look at the look on his face, like he has eaten in months

[01:27:40.030 --> 01:27:42.290]
Cook him a hot meal sometime, would ya?

[01:27:42.290 --> 01:27:50.670]
God, if you'd stop snoring around here and go home and work over the oven and do a good job, he wouldn't look like he's fading away like Karen Carpenter on a bad day

[01:27:51.850 --> 01:28:02.470]
Another, by the way, survivor of WSNews, Mitch Wien ladies and gentlemen, one of America's outstanding engineers and geniuses, a dog track better like you've never seen a plunger

[01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:05.170]
A maniac who gets shut out at Sportsman Park

[01:28:06.510 --> 01:28:11.550]
With a green dress and a purple sash and the number eight, unbelievable

We had the fat Richard, what was the van? Richard van Schnook

[01:28:32.250 --> 01:28:36.350]
Well, we had them all over there man, oh god, those were the days

[01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:44.610]
Unbelievable at WSNews, I could tell you seriously tomorrow, I think I'll stick around the whole day, even if they don't like it

[01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:51.290]
With the dick and dud when they do that little funeral tomorrow, I got stories from the horse's tail, I mean you wouldn't believe

[01:28:52.910 --> 01:28:57.550]
Unbelievable stories, the night you're here Williams got mugged, his last night in town on his way to go back to Boston

[01:28:59.290 --> 01:29:04.990]
Running around the building, hiding from guys with guns who dragged the chains off his neck and a money out of his wallet

[01:29:06.990 --> 01:29:08.430]
What do you read and like it here?

[01:29:09.710 --> 01:29:13.150]
21 afternoon at WIOD, here's a call, well let's see how this guy's doing

But what are you gonna do without WNWS to kick around?

[01:29:29.770 --> 01:29:31.230]
Well we can milk this for a few months

[01:29:31.230 --> 01:29:32.030]
Yeah that's true

[01:29:32.030 --> 01:29:33.110]
Okay, good luck

So anyways I was starting to say before I interrupted myself the unicorn village market and restaurant on the waterways 207th and the US1

[01:29:50.650 --> 01:29:51.890]
Unbelievable as always

[01:29:52.570 --> 01:29:56.230]
See food charter, I'm telling you the brown rice with the mushroom sauce, that's all I need

[01:29:56.230 --> 01:29:59.870]
I mean this other I'll take a little bite but this is just up my alley

[01:30:00.770 --> 01:30:01.830]
Let's try Kendall

[01:30:05.230 --> 01:30:05.630]
Connie

[01:30:07.230 --> 01:30:07.630]
Connie

[01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:11.790]
On MGM with the yellow label Mitch

[01:30:12.690 --> 01:30:13.090]
Connie

[01:30:16.990 --> 01:30:19.910]
Oh God, you know that was Mayor Bob Cox who played that

[01:30:19.910 --> 01:30:22.370]
That's how desperate he is to bring the spring breakers back

[01:30:22.910 --> 01:30:25.670]
Now all of a sudden that he got his haircut too short and it affected his braze

[01:30:25.670 --> 01:30:28.190]
Hey what's wrong, let's bring him back, we always wanted him anyway right?

[01:30:28.550 --> 01:30:29.730]
Yeah, good luck to you pal

[01:30:30.250 --> 01:30:30.690]

Hello, yes sir

[01:30:32.090 --> 01:30:38.470]
I saw Sandy on TV and then she was saying well that's talk show, that's talk show business

[01:30:38.470 --> 01:30:40.490]
Yeah, you know what else she said?

[01:30:40.650 --> 01:30:41.090]
What?

[01:30:41.490 --> 01:30:42.670]
I'm dying on my hands

[01:30:42.670 --> 01:30:47.490]
I saw her years ago, about 15 years ago

[01:30:47.490 --> 01:30:48.090]
Yeah, at least

[01:30:48.890 --> 01:30:50.730]
Oh my stomach's hurt

[01:30:50.730 --> 01:30:53.630]
Well I'm eating lunch right now so I was not good to graphic

[01:30:53.630 --> 01:30:56.210]
It looks like she paints her eyebrows on

[01:30:56.210 --> 01:30:57.890]
Hasn't the eyebrows left in them?

[01:30:57.910 --> 01:30:58.810]
Yeah, sure in Williams

[01:30:59.290 --> 01:31:02.870]

[01:31:04.990 --> 01:31:07.050]
Well, a matter of fact I had a good day

[01:31:07.050 --> 01:31:07.470]
Really?

[01:31:07.770 --> 01:31:11.730]
I had a very good day which I'm surprised because I never won a call they're never never

[01:31:11.730 --> 01:31:13.050]
Well I'm close to you

[01:31:13.050 --> 01:31:16.630]
And they have some better horses there

[01:31:16.630 --> 01:31:19.090]
Yeah, Ellsmagic douchebag, that's my favorite

[01:31:19.090 --> 01:31:22.310]
They had some horses in the 90s, they Jackie wacky

[01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:23.830]
Oh yeah, that's a good one

[01:31:23.830 --> 01:31:24.570]

[01:31:26.730 --> 01:31:31.190]
Well they got my buddies over there, they got some good jockeys, Stuart Elliott and Mike Gonzalez and Dave Les

[01:31:31.190 --> 01:31:33.930]
Elliot took over a couple horses yesterday

[01:31:33.930 --> 01:31:35.450]
Good riders, Stuart Elliott

[01:31:35.450 --> 01:31:36.230]
Great with them

[01:31:36.230 --> 01:31:36.710]
Yes sir

He pulled them in

[01:31:37.950 --> 01:31:38.650]
Good little rider

[01:31:38.650 --> 01:31:40.870]
And there's a couple of jockeys that

[01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:41.810]
He's no Dave rider

[01:31:41.810 --> 01:31:42.270]
Pardon?

[01:31:42.270 --> 01:31:43.710]
I say he's no Dave rider

[01:31:46.010 --> 01:31:47.550]
No, he's no easy rider either

[01:31:47.550 --> 01:31:47.850]
Right

[01:31:48.930 --> 01:31:50.230]
Here comes easy goer

We should hear the whole call of that race, and we should hear the whole call of that race, and we can see all those spots

[01:31:52.910 --> 01:31:58.210]
Oh they're saying in the news today that breeders' cup isn't really going to be much because there's no outs

[01:31:58.210 --> 01:32:01.530]
Now all the good horses got injured, so what's the big stimulus right? Who cares

[01:32:01.530 --> 01:32:04.290]
Well, well, we could just put Don and No out there

[01:32:04.290 --> 01:32:05.310]
There you go

[01:32:05.310 --> 01:32:06.210]
That would be good

[01:32:06.210 --> 01:32:09.970]
And you put them in a chariot and have John Brunetti whipping them

[01:32:09.970 --> 01:32:10.510]
That would be nice

[01:32:10.510 --> 01:32:12.510]

[01:32:12.510 --> 01:32:14.770]

and

[01:37:50.710 --> 01:37:51.170]
and

[01:37:51.170 --> 01:37:52.730]
and

[01:37:52.730 --> 01:37:54.350]
and

[01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:54.790]
and

[01:37:54.790 --> 01:37:54.850]
and

[01:37:54.850 --> 01:37:54.890]
and

[01:37:54.890 --> 01:37:55.150]
and

[01:37:55.150 --> 01:37:56.530]
and

[01:37:56.530 --> 01:37:56.770]
and

[01:37:56.770 --> 01:37:57.850]
and

[01:37:57.850 --> 01:37:59.030]
and

[01:37:59.030 --> 01:37:59.030]

[01:37:59.030 --> 01:37:59.030]

[01:37:59.630 --> 01:38:01.910]
and

[01:38:02.830 --> 01:38:03.590]
and

[01:38:04.230 --> 01:38:04.950]
and

[01:38:04.950 --> 01:38:06.710]
and

[01:38:06.710 --> 01:38:06.710]

[01:38:06.710 --> 01:38:06.710]

[01:38:06.710 --> 01:38:08.470]
there

[01:38:22.630 --> 01:38:24.150]
and

[01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:32.630]
C.41, an all-hit radio, 610 W.I.O. Day, all-hits all the time.

[01:38:33.310 --> 01:38:38.090]
Anyway, for this carrot cake from Unicorn Village, she gets so hysterical if I don't say

[01:38:38.090 --> 01:38:38.350]
a village.

[01:38:38.530 --> 01:38:39.930]
Unicorn Village, got it?

[01:38:40.810 --> 01:38:41.770]
Restaurant and market?

[01:38:42.350 --> 01:38:43.170]
At the waterways this?

[01:38:43.690 --> 01:38:44.830]
And there's like a half a cake left.

[01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:45.570]
Have you had some?

[01:38:46.210 --> 01:38:51.830]
The greatest carrot cake in the history of the human race and perhaps even predating that.

[01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:53.350]
It is just too good to be true.

[01:38:54.870 --> 01:38:55.690]
What is that?

[01:38:59.730 --> 01:39:01.270]
Isn't that incredible?

[01:39:01.510 --> 01:39:02.450]
What is that for us?

[01:39:03.790 --> 01:39:07.270]
Well, isn't that beautiful from Flora's?

[01:39:07.770 --> 01:39:09.530]
Can you hold it up a second so I can see it?

[01:39:10.010 --> 01:39:10.770]
It's a map.

[01:39:11.610 --> 01:39:13.770]
It says, stick them in the desert and don't give them a map.

[01:39:14.410 --> 01:39:19.850]
North Miami Beach, sunny isles and vicinity and it's got all the highlights and the low lights.

[01:39:20.330 --> 01:39:25.850]
There's the mobile station in the century 21 in Charlie Tunis and budget red car and

[01:39:26.530 --> 01:39:29.690]
Seaberk Resort Hotel and Apotments in the Hawaiian Isle.

[01:39:32.270 --> 01:39:33.670]
And boy, that's neat.

[01:39:33.910 --> 01:39:34.390]
That's great.

[01:39:34.510 --> 01:39:35.990]
We're going to hang that right on the thing here.

[01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:37.690]
Thank you very much.

[01:39:37.730 --> 01:39:38.730]
That's from our friends at Flora's.

[01:39:38.750 --> 01:39:40.010]
How are you going in your new thing over there?

[01:39:40.110 --> 01:39:40.530]
Is it working out?

[01:39:41.790 --> 01:39:42.150]
Finally.

[01:39:42.330 --> 01:39:45.010]
Well, it goes to show you if you can last long enough, but good things happen.

[01:39:45.550 --> 01:39:45.810]
Great.

[01:39:46.010 --> 01:39:46.450]
Thanks a lot.

[01:39:47.670 --> 01:39:49.710]
That's from Flora's up here on 79th Street.

[01:39:49.870 --> 01:39:50.290]
What a day.

[01:39:50.430 --> 01:39:51.070]
What a day.

[01:39:51.310 --> 01:39:52.070]
We're doing it.

[01:39:52.750 --> 01:39:56.370]
And I think I swallowed some carrot cake the wrong way so I'll start choking it like that.

[01:39:56.630 --> 01:39:57.350]
Listen to that.

[01:39:57.730 --> 01:39:59.310]
You should only choke on it.

[01:39:59.570 --> 01:40:00.130]
I am.

[01:40:04.530 --> 01:40:06.330]
Boy, so they were eating on the ear.

[01:40:06.450 --> 01:40:09.910]
Maybe that's what Dennis was talking about because when he started that chazarai at 10 o'clock

[01:40:09.910 --> 01:40:11.390]
and he came on with his dramatic announcement.

[01:40:12.030 --> 01:40:14.970]
He said, well, I guess we're going to do something that's never been done.

[01:40:14.970 --> 01:40:16.850]
I guess anywhere in the history of radio, what?

[01:40:17.130 --> 01:40:17.770]
What was it?

[01:40:18.430 --> 01:40:21.030]
They put a bunch of people who were getting fired on for half an hour.

[01:40:21.170 --> 01:40:21.770]
Is that what that was?

[01:40:22.130 --> 01:40:22.770]
What does that mean?

[01:40:24.130 --> 01:40:26.870]
And the rumor line has it that they were eating on the ear.

[01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:30.330]
And Sandy's great punchline was, what are they going to do?

[01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.950]
Fire us.

[01:40:31.970 --> 01:40:34.390]
I wonder if she was eating sugar cookies, Michael.

[01:40:34.770 --> 01:40:35.430]
Sugar cookies.

[01:40:36.690 --> 01:40:39.410]
Oh, I wonder who was the PD that had that brilliant idea?

[01:40:39.530 --> 01:40:42.890]
Was that Mike Anthony, the assassin that wanted to put her on the ear for hours with her?

[01:40:42.890 --> 01:40:46.770]
I mean, at 9 to 10, I was just a disaster when they had them on together.

[01:40:47.610 --> 01:40:49.950]
You could just hear Reneerie wrenching his teeth.

[01:40:49.950 --> 01:40:54.330]
They were just clattering in his mouth or in a glass somewhere.

[01:40:55.370 --> 01:40:58.930]
And then they wanted to stick him with her all morning and he was just apoplectic.

[01:41:00.070 --> 01:41:00.550]
Right, sir?

[01:41:04.650 --> 01:41:07.530]
Sounds like the tune weaver is a happy birthday baby, doesn't it?

[01:41:09.330 --> 01:41:09.730]
What is it?

[01:41:09.770 --> 01:41:10.770]
Oh, this is another one of those hits.

[01:41:11.670 --> 01:41:12.770]
And we're going to be hearing.

[01:41:15.990 --> 01:41:18.310]
Where is my Jerry Wichner record, by the way?

[01:41:18.450 --> 01:41:18.950]
Are you still there?

[01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:19.550]
Yeah.

[01:41:19.950 --> 01:41:21.290]
What happened to my Jerry Wichner record?

[01:41:21.430 --> 01:41:23.090]
Help me make it through the night with Sammy Smith.

[01:41:23.570 --> 01:41:25.230]
Don't drop the ball, Sammy, on the way over here.

[01:41:26.510 --> 01:41:30.330]
We have an open line in date 7519463, Coral Springs.

[01:41:31.030 --> 01:41:35.770]
Yeah, Neil, I get the distinct impression that W's news has changed.

[01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:42.760]
You know, happened that they made the decision at the last minute because a friend of mine with ABC Radio in New York,

[01:41:43.020 --> 01:41:47.000]
I called and they said they were not informed until late yesterday afternoon.

[01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:52.580]
Yeah, well they weren't going to do it quite as quickly but somebody let the cat out of the bag, I guess it was me yesterday.

[01:41:53.060 --> 01:41:53.380]
Really?

[01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:55.600]
Kind of forced their hand, so to speak.

[01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:01.700]
Well, I called up there to see what was going to happen to certain programs like Paul Harvey and stuff like that.

[01:42:01.700 --> 01:42:01.920]
Yeah.

[01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:03.180]
Where is Paul Harvey?

[01:42:03.180 --> 01:42:05.220]
Well, is the station in Belgrade?

[01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:06.880]
Did they usually carry Paul Harvey?

[01:42:07.900 --> 01:42:08.260]
WSWN.

[01:42:08.340 --> 01:42:08.540]
Yeah.

[01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:13.280]
Well, I was just going up and down the dial to see if maybe they had found a new home,

[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:17.220]
right away here locally but then I heard it and I guess I got confused as to what station it was.

[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:21.100]
This parrot cake is so good, it would make you forget all about Paul Harvey, I'm telling you.

[01:42:21.140 --> 01:42:22.180]
And all about W's news?

[01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:23.240]
Well, that's easy.

[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:25.580]
But you call up the W's news.

[01:42:25.780 --> 01:42:30.540]
I mean, the lines are just jammed and you get a hold of some stupid receptionist who catches you along with some other stupid girl.

[01:42:30.540 --> 01:42:32.620]
Why don't you just leave them alone?

[01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:35.560]
Also, I'm set over there and just leave them alone.

[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:37.180]
It's a sad day.

[01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:41.540]
And they go, and everyone's in a staff meeting right now, they say.

[01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:42.080]
Yeah.

[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:45.700]
And that they, she said this, she said this is the girl holding the staff right now.

[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:51.540]
She said to me, she said this is going to be a crazy day around here as if there never is.

[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:57.660]
And she said we really don't know, she said, quote, we really don't know what we're doing here.

[01:42:57.900 --> 01:42:59.140]
Yeah, well, that's nothing new.

[01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:01.700]
At least we admit to it here.

[01:43:02.260 --> 01:43:09.820]
Well, I mean, it's like, I mean, even though you let the cow, the bag, you think that you could make some programming decisions as to what you were going to do.

[01:43:10.060 --> 01:43:12.640]
Well, they don't know whether they want to scream or read a banana, okay?

[01:43:13.340 --> 01:43:15.820]
Well, Sandy, what they say about Dennis Collins, don't you?

[01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:16.740]
No, what?

[01:43:17.260 --> 01:43:20.280]
He's a real, no one left.

[01:43:20.420 --> 01:43:21.300]
You set me up on that.

[01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:22.620]
Yeah. Good job.

[01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:25.400]
Okay, well, Sandy was on Channel 10 as that guy said earlier.

[01:43:25.540 --> 01:43:27.240]
Oh, no, and I missed it.

[01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:30.540]
Well, actually, she really didn't act like she could really give it you know why.

[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:32.460]
Yeah, well, she's got the boyfriend with Bucks.

[01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:33.460]
She's moving out to Vegas.

[01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:34.640]
She bought a condo out there.

[01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:35.400]
What is she care?

[01:43:35.660 --> 01:43:38.400]
They're going to stick her in the desert out there in Vegas and give her a map.

[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:40.120]
And she's going to have a great time and screw them.

[01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:40.940]
She's sick of it.

[01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:42.000]
And what is she care?

[01:43:42.140 --> 01:43:44.160]
And what a week here. She's boring as dog do.

[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:45.100]
Call it a great day.

[01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:45.680]
And you too.

[01:43:48.340 --> 01:43:48.660]
1247.

[01:43:49.660 --> 01:43:51.320]
At WIOD, your friendly station.

[01:43:51.420 --> 01:43:53.940]
If you're over the age of 100, go away. We hate you like poison.

[01:43:54.460 --> 01:43:56.240]
We have an open line in Broward 524WIOD.

[01:43:56.680 --> 01:44:00.300]
Are we being graced by Susan Darwin doing the one o'clock news by any chance?

[01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:01.880]
No. Oh, geez.

[01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:03.140]
You do such a good job.

[01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:06.120]
Even though you do seven or eight minutes, it's still a good job.

[01:44:07.460 --> 01:44:09.480]
Like I said, we have an opening in Broward.

[01:44:09.540 --> 01:44:12.160]
I think I said that we have one more break to do, which we will do right now.

[01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:15.400]
And we'll be back, George, right after this.

[01:44:16.300 --> 01:44:17.680]
Okay, 1250 at WIOD.

[01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:19.660]
We have an open line in Broward 524.

[01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:21.320]
Please have some carrot cake, Murray.

[01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:22.780]
Have a half a cake.

[01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:24.520]
What did I say?

[01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:26.500]
We have one open line in Broward 524.

[01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:27.520]
9463.

[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:29.840]
We have a call allegedly from Key West.

[01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:37.040]
Jerry!

[01:44:37.620 --> 01:44:40.280]
Take the river from my home.

[01:44:40.580 --> 01:44:40.920]
Oh!

[01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:43.000]
Boy, this is done for me.

[01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:46.480]
Take it loose and let it fall.

[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:48.840]
Yeah.

[01:44:49.220 --> 01:44:51.940]
Take it off and let it fall.

[01:44:52.940 --> 01:44:53.600]
Let's fall.

[01:44:54.180 --> 01:44:54.940]
Take your hands.

[01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:58.300]
Like a shadow of one.

[01:44:59.680 --> 01:45:01.020]
It's like dizzy room.

[01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:03.840]
Fallen lay down by my side.

[01:45:05.300 --> 01:45:06.700]
I'll be checking in.

[01:45:07.180 --> 01:45:10.060]
Build a more line.

[01:45:10.820 --> 01:45:12.080]
Spread it in from Hollywood.

[01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:16.080]
All I'm thinking is your time.

[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:20.880]
I hope you make it easy.

[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:25.520]
Boy, does this bring back those memories it's tugging at the strings of my thing?

[01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:30.320]
Are we taping this I hope I pray?

[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:35.100]
We'll be talking, going on through it.

[01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:39.480]
Let's get our way to Mama.

[01:45:41.980 --> 01:45:46.360]
Oh, God, I need you, please.

[01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:50.780]
Just say you say God.

[01:45:52.060 --> 01:45:53.480]
It's a good order, Willow.

[01:45:53.980 --> 01:45:56.680]
And my Lord is outside.

[01:45:57.220 --> 01:45:58.100]
Straighten your way, God Jerry.

[01:45:58.260 --> 01:45:59.160]
People are starting to talk.

[01:45:59.740 --> 01:46:03.520]
And it's best to be a Lord with God.

[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:03.520]

[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:05.520]
It's best to be a Lord with God.

[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:11.860]
It's best to be a Lord with God.

[01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:14.340]
It's best to be a Lord with God.

[01:46:14.340 --> 01:46:17.020]
How you doing, Chubby?

[01:46:17.820 --> 01:46:18.640]
Not you, Marie.

[01:46:21.140 --> 01:46:24.200]
Betty Ann, wherever you are, that big talk show audience in the sky.

[01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:28.940]
And Jan and Hollywood too.

[01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:37.200]
I don't want to be a Lord with God.

[01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:37.820]
I don't want to be a Lord with God.

[01:46:37.820 --> 01:46:38.280]
Big finish.

[01:46:41.340 --> 01:46:44.360]
I don't want to be a Lord with God.

[01:46:45.220 --> 01:46:47.100]
Unbelievable, God.

[01:46:47.500 --> 01:46:48.000]
We want it.

[01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:49.120]
We got it.

[01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:52.020]
And this is the only place you're going to get it.

[01:46:52.300 --> 01:46:53.000]
Can you believe that?

[01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:55.300]
The unexpergated version.

[01:46:55.300 --> 01:46:58.880]
And Sammie Smith carrying that football like a loaf of bread.

[01:46:59.180 --> 01:47:01.260]
Singing, help me make it fake it through the night.

[01:47:01.420 --> 01:47:04.620]
Jerry, which your lives, ladies and gentlemen, the only survivor.

[01:47:05.240 --> 01:47:08.000]
Which goes to show what I've always said when they're going to fire your ass.

[01:47:08.180 --> 01:47:10.080]
Always have a 357 magnum handy.

[01:47:10.860 --> 01:47:12.080]
That shines a lot.

[01:47:13.180 --> 01:47:16.320]
Okay, let's, now did you eat the cake already or is it like in the thing there?

[01:47:17.180 --> 01:47:18.200]
Isn't that incredible?

[01:47:18.860 --> 01:47:19.260]
Unbelievable.

[01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:20.200]
Let's care it, cake.

[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:20.780]
It's moist.

[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:21.580]
It is delicious.

[01:47:21.620 --> 01:47:24.920]
It's got that like stuff in the middle, like cream cheese or whatever that is.

[01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:26.440]
It's just beyond belief.

[01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:29.780]
Outstanding from the unicorn village.

[01:47:30.180 --> 01:47:30.980]
Excuse me.

[01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:35.100]
So anyway, Murray and DeWayneon will want to sell the white hats at the dolphin games at your

[01:47:35.100 --> 01:47:35.620]
Robbie Stadium.

[01:47:35.620 --> 01:47:38.700]
So if anybody knows who they should talk to, please a call in George.

[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:41.800]
Or Rick and Suds will make the contacts through their Monday night.

[01:47:41.980 --> 01:47:44.200]
The big shot head honchos up there at the stadium.

[01:47:44.380 --> 01:47:44.820]
Trust me.

[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:48.080]
In no time at all, we'll have you sell those porkers up there like crazy.

[01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:49.580]
Okay, Murray.

[01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:50.260]
Have a great life.

[01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:51.040]
You bet.

[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:51.920]
Carl Springs.

[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:52.440]
Hi, Nea.

[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:52.820]
How are you doing?

[01:47:52.820 --> 01:47:53.260]
Great.

[01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:59.080]
It's kind of a sad moment in all our lives, especially going back as far as I do with you,

[01:47:59.180 --> 01:47:59.820]
Neil WNW.

[01:48:01.260 --> 01:48:02.340]
What about the one-

[01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:03.160]
I'm not snippin'.

[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:03.980]
I just got a head cold.

[01:48:04.140 --> 01:48:04.280]
Yes.

[01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:06.380]
The famous name game, Neil.

[01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:08.320]
Can you remember the famous name game?

[01:48:08.700 --> 01:48:09.700]
The name game?

[01:48:09.780 --> 01:48:14.500]
The famous name game with all the hundred people calling in and winning prizes.

[01:48:14.940 --> 01:48:16.360]
It pays for the day.

[01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:17.140]
Oh, yeah.

[01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:22.200]
I remember the Battle of the Tuck Hose that I started and they still, after I left, I showed

[01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:22.320]
you.

[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:26.220]
I remember the one where we were asking those embarrassing questions and somebody asked Alice

[01:48:26.220 --> 01:48:28.340]
who we'd like to be left on a desert island with.

[01:48:29.140 --> 01:48:29.580]
Woo!

[01:48:30.340 --> 01:48:32.200]
How about Spacey Stacey Lieberman?

[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:32.600]
Yeah!

[01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:34.360]
Does anybody know what she is?

[01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:34.460]
Oh, yeah!

[01:48:34.820 --> 01:48:39.940]
Stacey Lieberman, my first producer at WS News, who booked General William West Berlin, President

[01:48:39.940 --> 01:48:43.260]
Lincoln and President Roosevelt all on my show the week that she was leaving.

[01:48:44.300 --> 01:48:44.740]
What?

[01:48:44.860 --> 01:48:46.640]
In some strange reason none of them showed up.

[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:49.100]
What about the cab driver that did the news?

[01:48:50.020 --> 01:48:52.180]
You remember that guy that had been cab driver off the hill?

[01:48:52.180 --> 01:48:52.780]
Yeah.

[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:54.180]
The guy's name was Larry.

[01:48:54.340 --> 01:48:57.700]
Another Larry, I can't remember his last name and his most famous moments.

[01:48:58.060 --> 01:48:59.020]
Oh, he was doing it.

[01:48:59.020 --> 01:48:59.520]
He was doing it.

[01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:04.480]
He was doing the new news with Prescott Robinson one day and all of a sudden he started

[01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:09.480]
laughing hysterically and on the air Prescott says, what's so funny?

[01:49:09.780 --> 01:49:12.200]
Prescott and he said, I just passed gas.

[01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:18.780]
Then there was another story that he was editorializing and something about some ruling at the Vatican.

[01:49:18.780 --> 01:49:20.580]
He said, the late Jesus Christ.

[01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:22.980]
I had that tape of you doing that.

[01:49:23.100 --> 01:49:25.620]
I think it was the third anniversary show on NWS.

[01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:27.080]
You were coming on a Sunday.

[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:27.600]
Yeah.

[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:33.600]
I caught the first half hour on tape from what I owned my memory bank from what I had left over.

[01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:35.860]
Do you have anything like that in your library?

[01:49:36.100 --> 01:49:36.680]
No, sir.

[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:37.380]
Go ahead.

[01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:38.240]
Can I send that to you?

[01:49:38.420 --> 01:49:41.040]
I learned a valuable lesson from Richard Nixon, Burnham Hall.

[01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:41.660]
Burnham Hall?

[01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:42.660]
Yeah, I'd love to have.

[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:44.320]
Okay, I'll send that to you.

[01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:47.680]
And since that was probably from the well had to be because I only worked for Subbrink over there,

[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:49.600]
it's my property so we could play it on the air.

[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:54.560]
Okay, and finally the crowning jewel, the one I'd love dearly, holy Joe.

[01:49:55.020 --> 01:49:55.240]
Yeah.

[01:49:55.900 --> 01:49:57.300]
Anybody know where holy Joe is?

[01:49:58.060 --> 01:50:01.260]
I think he's in that holy roller beach in the sky.

[01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:04.240]
But you might see me separating heaven because of the way he portrayed that.

[01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:06.440]
Reverend Charles Klein to you, sir.

[01:50:06.660 --> 01:50:08.460]
Okay, have a good day, Neil.

[01:50:08.660 --> 01:50:08.860]
Thanks.

[01:50:10.140 --> 01:50:11.500]
WIOD, Georgia Spastic.

[01:50:12.220 --> 01:50:12.740]
They're gone.

[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:13.940]
Okay, just as well.

[01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:14.780]
Just as well.

[01:50:15.220 --> 01:50:17.360]
Trouble maker on a starline, you can always tell.

[01:50:18.500 --> 01:50:19.820]
1256 in WIOD.

[01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:21.160]
I hope you haven't missed all the excitement.

[01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:22.200]
If you've been sleeping in.

[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:25.000]
Sitting in his nowhere.

[01:50:25.500 --> 01:50:26.360]
Bit of traumatic day.

[01:50:26.460 --> 01:50:27.100]
WS news.

[01:50:27.260 --> 01:50:32.240]
It was forced to bite the bullet about 30, 40 hours earlier than planned because somehow it sneaked out.

[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:33.320]
The word got out of the bag.

[01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:34.700]
The cat got out of the caboose.

[01:50:35.340 --> 01:50:37.260]
That nasty Neil put the stuff on the air.

[01:50:37.460 --> 01:50:38.840]
Dennis Collins was apoplectic.

[01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:44.380]
So instead of waiting from 430 to 5 tomorrow afternoon because obviously all of their calls all day today would have been.

[01:50:44.380 --> 01:50:45.440]
Is it true?

[01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:47.700]
Say he's only making it up.

[01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:49.060]
And let me ask you something.

[01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:53.880]
If all those crotchety old people are calling over there say, quoting me, how is it that they're hearing it?

[01:50:53.940 --> 01:50:58.860]
Unless they're listening, they're having a radio accident if Junalison knows what I mean.

[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.300]
Another radio accident in their pants.

[01:51:03.300 --> 01:51:04.160]
Miami Lakes.

[01:51:04.340 --> 01:51:05.280]
Hey, Neil, how's it going?

[01:51:05.540 --> 01:51:05.860]
Okay.

[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:07.180]
It's a sad day, isn't it?

[01:51:08.360 --> 01:51:11.640]
Uh, Neil, I was reading your favorite paper today.

[01:51:12.420 --> 01:51:22.920]
And do you know that brother Nick is bringing over 20 Soviet pigs so that they can be together with having some training?

[01:51:23.140 --> 01:51:25.020]
Is there going to the dolphin game on Monday?

[01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:26.660]
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

[01:51:27.500 --> 01:51:27.780]
Yes.

[01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:33.680]
They're going to get together to see what they can do about being able to prosecute to...

[01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:35.600]
No, they're coming over here to teach Nick about freedom.

[01:51:35.980 --> 01:51:36.260]
Oh!

[01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:37.740]
That's what they're coming here for.

[01:51:38.100 --> 01:51:39.140]
So I wouldn't panic.

[01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:40.300]
You know, another thing.

[01:51:40.520 --> 01:51:40.680]
Yes.

[01:51:40.680 --> 01:51:42.000]
How's your diet doing?

[01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:42.780]
Okay.

[01:51:43.120 --> 01:51:45.840]
Are you sure you're not going to spaz out on us again?

[01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:47.840]
Not soon, maybe in about six months.

[01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:55.460]
Okay, because, uh, please, I could not stand to have that dick and suds on your show again.

[01:51:56.060 --> 01:51:57.600]
Well, let me ask you this.

[01:51:57.860 --> 01:52:02.540]
There's always another possibility since she is around and she like, um, how about Randy Martin?

[01:52:03.400 --> 01:52:03.520]
No.

[01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:06.300]
Stick to the desert.

[01:52:08.040 --> 01:52:09.280]
Don't give our a mask.

[01:52:10.300 --> 01:52:13.680]
I hate Rick Erily as much as I hate our senior hall.

[01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:15.140]
Rick, you suck.

[01:52:15.420 --> 01:52:16.220]
Let me ask you a question.

[01:52:16.920 --> 01:52:18.000]
Oh, gee, wouldn't hold on.

[01:52:18.140 --> 01:52:19.900]
Now, jika calling it a long distance like that.

[01:52:19.960 --> 01:52:20.660]
I can't believe it.

[01:52:20.700 --> 01:52:24.940]
He wasn't here to get the big story, but it was, uh, he was sharp enough to call it a long distance

[01:52:24.940 --> 01:52:26.660]
and get a little shot in there before Tuesday.

[01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:28.540]
Don't forget next Tuesday, all four hours.

[01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:30.040]
What timing did I lock out?

[01:52:30.080 --> 01:52:31.780]
Did I jump into a bucket or something or what?

[01:52:32.840 --> 01:52:35.700]
Tom, jika, W-I-O-D, Georgia's busy.

[01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:36.600]
Hi.

[01:52:36.940 --> 01:52:37.880]
I'm clinging to you.

[01:52:38.140 --> 01:52:38.660]
Sure, hold on.

[01:52:39.100 --> 01:52:40.340]
W-I-O-D, Georgia's busy.

[01:52:40.940 --> 01:52:41.440]
I don't know.

[01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:42.180]
How you doing?

[01:52:42.580 --> 01:52:42.880]
Listen.

[01:52:44.100 --> 01:52:46.340]
What's going on with this off-ass expressway up there?

[01:52:46.740 --> 01:52:47.360]
Meaning what?

[01:52:48.780 --> 01:52:51.120]
It's cost me two and a quarter to go three miles.

[01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:51.700]
That's right.

[01:52:52.300 --> 01:52:53.820]
It's called a dollar of hollard.

[01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:55.820]
I've never seen anything like it in my life.

[01:52:56.040 --> 01:52:59.320]
Last time I was on air, it cost me about 45 bucks to get home from Oakland Park Boulevard.

[01:52:59.320 --> 01:53:04.600]
I went for a power line road to get on to the sawgrass to get on to the turnpike.

[01:53:04.820 --> 01:53:05.020]
Yeah.

[01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:07.680]
They charge me 75 cents.

[01:53:07.800 --> 01:53:10.620]
They don't tell you that you can't get on to the turnpike going that way.

[01:53:10.780 --> 01:53:11.000]
Right.

[01:53:11.320 --> 01:53:16.280]
But they won't charge you 75 cents to go to Lyon's road and turn around and come back.

[01:53:16.500 --> 01:53:17.920]
So they can get another 75 cents?

[01:53:17.960 --> 01:53:19.780]
They can, of course, you know, a 75.

[01:53:19.800 --> 01:53:21.560]
And another 50 cents on the turnpike.

[01:53:21.740 --> 01:53:25.240]
But when you're coming back, the light is red for the turnpike address.

[01:53:25.420 --> 01:53:28.060]
So you go through the other ones, think you're getting on to the turnpike.

[01:53:28.060 --> 01:53:29.880]
But I'm back on power line road.

[01:53:30.020 --> 01:53:31.580]
Cost me about 75 cents.

[01:53:31.720 --> 01:53:33.380]
So that's 45.50 so far.

[01:53:33.420 --> 01:53:33.860]
Not bad.

[01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:36.420]
Can I make a suggestion to you, sir, because we're up against the news?

[01:53:36.520 --> 01:53:36.720]
Yeah.

[01:53:37.080 --> 01:53:38.240]
Vote for Lawton Childs.

[01:53:38.280 --> 01:53:39.040]
Lawton Childs?

[01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:40.440]
Well, we'll do the best we can.

[01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:40.940]
Okay.

[01:53:41.680 --> 01:53:42.900]
Well, listen, that's going to do it.

[01:53:42.900 --> 01:53:43.240]
Oh, my God.

[01:53:43.340 --> 01:53:44.200]
That's Susan Darwin.

[01:53:44.480 --> 01:53:45.300]
How about Charles Darwin?

[01:53:45.940 --> 01:53:46.960]
How about Danny Darwin?

[01:53:47.460 --> 01:53:47.680]
Elaine?

[01:53:48.380 --> 01:53:49.320]
How about Chuck Meyer?

[01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:53.600]
Elaine's going out with another 400-year-old boyfriend back to the keys again.

[01:53:53.720 --> 01:53:54.000]
Wow.

[01:53:54.120 --> 01:53:54.800]
Will that be something?

[01:53:54.800 --> 01:53:56.080]
Boo boy.

[01:53:57.660 --> 01:54:00.260]
Well, anyway, Elaine's got the one o'clock news.

[01:54:00.380 --> 01:54:02.520]
We'll come back with our gigantic one-to-two-hour dick and dud.

[01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:03.780]
They got the news from around the planet.

[01:54:03.980 --> 01:54:06.380]
They got the, they're going to prepare their big funeral for somebody.

[01:54:07.020 --> 01:54:09.980]
Sports talk at 6.05, the fight, the thing, and Randy tonight.

[01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:10.860]
Come on.

[01:54:11.180 --> 01:54:13.080]
I don't listen to the one-to-two hour.

[01:54:13.740 --> 01:54:16.520]
Wouldn't be prudent at this time.

[01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:23.040]
Millions have converted for fun and profit.

[01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:28.220]
Now, you two can turn your pagan ways around at Earl Stripesys.

[01:54:28.460 --> 01:54:31.060]
We'll convert any goi for just 99.95.

[01:54:31.540 --> 01:54:32.040]
That's right.

[01:54:32.520 --> 01:54:34.660]
Listen to one of our successful graduates.

[01:54:35.180 --> 01:54:39.340]
For Kim, I shall own Malaké, I shall own.

[01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:43.040]
At Earl Stripesys, we'll convert anyone into a Jew.

[01:54:43.780 --> 01:54:46.300]
Malaké, ha-ha-doch, baruchu.

[01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:49.900]
Translated means, sorry, I must have left my wallet at home.

[01:54:51.580 --> 01:54:54.840]
Millaké, ha-ma-la-jin, ha-ha-doch.

[01:54:54.960 --> 01:54:58.580]
Translated means, stewardess, did you make sure to give me a kosher meal?

[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:05.280]
Millaké, ha-ma-la-jin, ha-ha-doch, baruchu.

[01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:08.140]
Translated, yes, rabbi, the check is in the mail.

[01:55:08.620 --> 01:55:13.080]
Yes, you two can convert into a Jew for just 99.95 at Earl Stripesys.

[01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:15.940]
Act now and get a free Yardside candle for just $10.

[01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:22.100]
Earl Stripesys, we'll convert any goi for just 99.95 or more if we can.

[01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:26.600]
Hamla-jin, how the hell am I supposed to read backwards for Christ's sake?

[01:55:26.860 --> 01:55:29.700]
Well, you know what they say. Jefferson Pilot, according to Dennis Collins.

[01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:34.440]
We know the high road, we know the low road, and nobody takes the low road better than us.

[01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:35.860]
That's what he said.

[01:55:37.100 --> 01:55:37.700]
A ledge.

[01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:40.700]
When I call you up.

[01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:44.460]
Okay, 108 to WIOD, it's been a really traumatic day.

[01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:51.020]
We have an open line on the star line at Star IOD and also Palm Beach, 655 WNWS.

[01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:57.060]
Look at this, we got the ACN tapes and pretty interesting stuff for tomorrow.

[01:55:57.380 --> 01:55:58.180]
Throdo Rooter.

[01:55:59.940 --> 01:56:01.760]
Please hammer, don't hurt yourself.

[01:56:02.340 --> 01:56:08.780]
Altra trim fast, and on the street mall, men are scum, haul and oat bran.

[01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:15.740]
At a whole bunch of Tom Broke job promos, James Brown, FAA, Bush apology, LSD, birth control, Midget Psychic.

[01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:18.580]
So we're looking forward to some really heavy duty stuff.

[01:56:18.700 --> 01:56:21.260]
Maybe if we could have given the tape to them over there, they'd still be on ears.

[01:56:21.420 --> 01:56:22.800]
Think about that, Dennis, okay?

[01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:27.040]
And just to show that we're really going to kick things off here because this is where...

[01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:29.980]
You see, we gave Rick and says like, three whole days of shows now, it's unbelievable.

[01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:32.100]
They owe us something like a white hot.

[01:56:35.980 --> 01:56:39.520]
But anyway, that's where it all started on this show yesterday, around 1130.

[01:56:39.620 --> 01:56:44.220]
We got our first report from one of our radio spies that the change was imminent,

[01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:47.200]
was going to happen tomorrow, 430 to 5 goodbyes.

[01:56:47.740 --> 01:56:51.100]
And then when we blurted it out on the ear and they did their whole thing about the funeral procession,

[01:56:52.160 --> 01:56:56.420]
all of a sudden you can just see the clamoring and the gnashing of teeth and the changing of undies

[01:56:56.420 --> 01:56:58.120]
that went on over there, they must have been going nuts.

[01:56:58.900 --> 01:56:59.260]
Right?

[01:56:59.260 --> 01:56:59.320]
Right.

[01:57:01.580 --> 01:57:03.940]
Let me say it again, they must have been going nuts.

[01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:05.200]
Right?

[01:57:05.620 --> 01:57:05.880]
Oh!

[01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:06.480]
Yeah.

[01:57:07.620 --> 01:57:11.700]
So anyway, this morning they made the change in case you're just slipping out of the sack and,

[01:57:11.780 --> 01:57:14.960]
boy, like Johnny Dark, Johnny, if you're just getting in the car, guess what?

[01:57:16.340 --> 01:57:18.740]
No more talk, no more Debbie, no more Alice.

[01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:23.860]
We're all going to the palace for lunch.

[01:57:24.380 --> 01:57:27.920]
And actually, the last time I had lunch with Alice for intel was at a place called the Palace,

[01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:34.020]
in Fort Lauderdale, long gone, was on the US one, and we used to talk about Alice at the palace

[01:57:34.020 --> 01:57:35.920]
and choosing it all been out of shape about that.

[01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:38.180]
He did.

[01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:44.840]
Anyway, it's 10 past 1 at WIOD, so we welcome the Gillians, the thousands of new Geriatric listeners.

[01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:46.180]
We love you, our seniors.

[01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:48.980]
We're all a lot of presidents, bushes, do it all, you senior citizens.

[01:57:49.620 --> 01:57:53.800]
With Medicare, go out and vote for Lawton, Charles, and every Democratic candidate out of the sun.

[01:57:54.380 --> 01:57:54.680]
Okay?

[01:57:55.420 --> 01:57:59.120]
Just keep that in mind that Uncle Neal told you to do it. Vote two, three times.

[01:57:59.120 --> 01:57:59.920]
It could be your last.

[01:58:01.180 --> 01:58:04.040]
And Ron St. John Jr. has a fitting tribute today.

[01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:09.200]
And now, ladies and gentlemen, a musical tribute to W. Snoop.

[01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:10.140]
A heart.

[01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:12.200]
A pad, how you doing, baby?

[01:58:12.540 --> 01:58:13.000]
I.

[01:58:15.420 --> 01:58:16.520]
I get missed.

[01:58:17.500 --> 01:58:17.960]
Johnny.

[01:58:21.080 --> 01:58:21.540]
Huh?

[01:58:21.540 --> 01:58:23.140]
A little too rocky, I think.

[01:58:23.580 --> 01:58:24.260]
A little too rocky.

[01:58:24.420 --> 01:58:25.280]
That's more like the coast.

[01:58:27.240 --> 01:58:28.840]
No, no chance.

[01:58:30.040 --> 01:58:34.260]
Do you think they're going to be like the coast junior on AM?

[01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:36.080]
Yeah.

[01:58:36.980 --> 01:58:38.340]
Eat your heart out, Connie.

[01:58:41.420 --> 01:58:43.360]
Eat this, Mayor Cock, Crotch.

[01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:50.100]
Life seems so empty since you went away.

[01:58:53.340 --> 01:58:59.820]
Oh, definitely a Jerry Wichner Wiener if I ever heard that.

[01:59:01.680 --> 01:59:03.920]
On my bulldozer.

[01:59:05.200 --> 01:59:07.440]
Oh, I wish I got a sacred fire.

[01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:09.000]
A wide, highland lives.

[01:59:09.540 --> 01:59:14.260]
The whole day is my friend with that day.

[01:59:14.260 --> 01:59:16.420]
Very happy it is from the coast newsroom.

[01:59:16.820 --> 01:59:21.500]
And I forever ran to the beach.

[01:59:22.040 --> 01:59:22.580]
I'm happy.

[01:59:24.320 --> 01:59:25.360]
I'm happy.

[01:59:26.940 --> 01:59:28.180]
I'm happy.

[01:59:28.180 --> 01:59:28.560]
I'm happy.

[01:59:32.440 --> 01:59:33.580]
Was that it?

[01:59:34.440 --> 01:59:35.720]
Was that it?

[01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:40.220]
I guess that was it.

[01:59:43.880 --> 01:59:45.980]
12 minutes after one at WIOD.

[01:59:46.340 --> 01:59:47.620]
That was a great job, Ron.

[01:59:47.820 --> 01:59:48.040]
Excellent.

[01:59:48.420 --> 01:59:49.320]
Worked on effort weeks.

[01:59:49.960 --> 01:59:50.540]
You know what was coming?

[01:59:51.940 --> 01:59:53.360]
524 WIOD in Broward.

[01:59:53.440 --> 01:59:54.680]
Now some straight talk for you.

[01:59:54.880 --> 01:59:56.140]
We love our seniors.

[01:59:56.920 --> 01:59:59.760]
If you're under the age of 200, we welcome you with open arms and fists.

[02:00:01.060 --> 02:00:02.300]
We have an open line in Palm Beach.

[02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:15.200]
We have an open line in Palm Beach.

[02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:15.200]

[02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:15.200]

[02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:15.200]

[02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:16.160]
We have an open line in Palm Beach.

[02:00:16.160 --> 02:00:17.040]
We have an open line in Palm Beach.

[02:00:17.140 --> 02:00:18.680]
We have an open line in Palm Beach.

[02:00:18.680 --> 02:00:19.920]
We have an open line in Palm Beach.

[02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:21.880]
We have an open line in Palm Beach.

[02:00:21.880 --> 02:00:24.920]
We have an open line in Palm Beach.

[02:00:24.920 --> 02:00:30.240]
We have an open line in Palm Beach.

[02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:32.280]
We have an open line in Palm Beach.

[02:00:32.280 --> 02:00:37.700]
They were going to do that tomorrow afternoon in the idea that they were going to be over there getting lost.

[02:00:37.740 --> 02:00:39.120]
Now they beat us to the punch.

[02:00:40.620 --> 02:00:42.420]
They got out of there and they beat it.

[02:00:44.200 --> 02:00:45.700]
But they'll probably go ahead and do it anyway.

[02:00:45.920 --> 02:00:46.740]
Kill a good four hours.

[02:00:47.500 --> 02:00:49.440]
Let's take a call from Fort Lauderdale.

[02:00:49.960 --> 02:00:50.320]
Hey Neil.

[02:00:50.720 --> 02:00:51.020]
Yes sir.

[02:00:51.180 --> 02:00:53.740]
What am I going to do when I want to get hold of Jack from the beach now?

[02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.160]
Well, just the probably WFTO would be good.

[02:00:57.240 --> 02:00:58.560]
I think Jack's going to start moving north.

[02:00:58.560 --> 02:00:59.420]
I can't.

[02:00:59.420 --> 02:01:02.140]
All these TV tours that I have, when's the repairman coming back?

[02:01:02.780 --> 02:01:04.260]
Sunday morning on the main green show.

[02:01:04.780 --> 02:01:06.920]
And how about the old crystal ball from Sebastian?

[02:01:07.940 --> 02:01:08.360]
So why?

[02:01:08.580 --> 02:01:11.800]
Don't you remember the guy who did the ESP on Sandy Payton?

[02:01:12.340 --> 02:01:12.520]
No.

[02:01:12.640 --> 02:01:13.580]
Yes, he was from the island.

[02:01:13.660 --> 02:01:15.960]
But I do remember my friend from the cock and bull restaurant.

[02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:16.840]
What was his name?

[02:01:16.840 --> 02:01:17.980]
He used to play the guitar.

[02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:20.100]
And he sang on the jury watching the show.

[02:01:20.100 --> 02:01:21.060]
What was his name?

[02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:23.020]
Oh, you don't know.

[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:25.760]
Oh my god, you haven't lived.

[02:01:26.640 --> 02:01:27.740]
Everybody used to hear him.

[02:01:27.740 --> 02:01:31.280]
And they'd say Elvis, Elvis, you sound nothing like him at all.

[02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:32.780]
Elvis was incredible.

[02:01:33.140 --> 02:01:38.680]
Do you think that Dennis Collins was trying to overshadow the 7-11 bank upcy?

[02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:40.680]
He figured maybe that would carry more news.

[02:01:40.860 --> 02:01:43.560]
Nobody would ever realize that they were closing down.

[02:01:43.940 --> 02:01:47.220]
He's a real no-well man.

[02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:48.380]
Yeah.

[02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:50.240]
And Kane starts Monday, huh?

[02:01:50.660 --> 02:01:51.320]
A week from Monday.

[02:01:51.420 --> 02:01:51.820]
A week from Monday.

[02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:53.080]
WFTO, where do you live?

[02:01:53.540 --> 02:01:54.100]
For a lot of them.

[02:01:54.460 --> 02:01:55.000]
No chance.

[02:01:56.160 --> 02:01:57.520]
You know where the towers are?

[02:01:57.920 --> 02:01:58.940]

[02:01:59.180 --> 02:02:01.160]
They're like on, I think they're on 95.

[02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:03.280]

[02:02:03.480 --> 02:02:03.820]

[02:07:13.020 --> 02:07:16.140]
Well, I had to move it up a little because we left their cats out of the bag

[02:07:16.140 --> 02:07:21.880]
So they had to move it up a little to avoid any further embarrassment so to speak yeah, and then

[02:07:22.560 --> 02:07:25.100]
Yeah, and then all of a sudden I hear you guys

[02:07:25.680 --> 02:07:30.620]

You're damn right. We already been through that. We don't want any part of them. That's boy Gary

[02:07:35.720 --> 02:07:40.100]
We had just associated ourselves as usual from any of that crap from middle-level management

[02:07:40.100 --> 02:07:42.340]
It's just another bonehead idea

[02:07:42.340 --> 02:07:47.520]
Now just keep playing your old put stuff and all that when he runs that spot, you know, on all the old parts

[02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:52.680]
You know, maybe they'll turn off the operative words. You're right. See you. Talk to you later 135

[02:08:02.860 --> 02:08:07.540]
Often it should always burn and have

[02:08:07.540 --> 02:08:12.460]
There is no cause for concern

[02:08:13.340 --> 02:08:15.460]

Am right

[02:08:30.160 --> 02:08:33.060]
It doesn't help to be

[02:08:33.060 --> 02:08:35.180]
Constipated and

[02:08:35.180 --> 02:08:36.120]

All right Dennis just relax 140-20-2 at WIOD a day that will live in the annals of broadcast history forever

They're going to put it in the time capsule. They're going to stick Dennis in the Smithsonian Institute

[02:10:35.280 --> 02:10:37.980]
Six years every night I put up with this crap

Judy Fruity, LA

[02:17:01.060 --> 02:17:05.380]
I was lying in my bed watching late night TV

[02:17:05.380 --> 02:17:10.120]
When Ange and Lizzo bagged and she started to do the clap thing

[02:17:12.900 --> 02:17:14.140]
Clap thing

[02:17:17.420 --> 02:17:19.600]
Her arms were really flabby

[02:17:19.600 --> 02:17:21.600]
Her face was really crabby

[02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:25.920]
But something made me happy when the bags she did the clap thing

[02:17:28.680 --> 02:17:30.060]
Clap thing

[02:17:30.740 --> 02:17:32.280]
I'm dying on the hands

[02:17:33.740 --> 02:17:35.700]
So I turned the lights down low

[02:17:35.700 --> 02:17:37.380]
That back to watch the show

[02:17:37.380 --> 02:17:41.960]
And then wouldn't you know I started to do the clap thing

[02:17:43.260 --> 02:17:44.480]
Clap on

[02:17:44.480 --> 02:17:46.020]
Clap thing

[02:17:47.740 --> 02:17:48.460]
Clap on

[02:17:51.740 --> 02:17:52.580]

[02:17:52.580 --> 02:17:53.780]
Clap thing

[02:17:55.740 --> 02:17:56.660]
Clap on

[02:17:57.740 --> 02:17:59.080]
Why I started to ache

[02:17:59.740 --> 02:18:01.020]
My body is itchy

[02:18:01.020 --> 02:18:05.720]
It was all that I could take when that bag she did the clap thing

[02:18:07.740 --> 02:18:08.360]
Clap on

[02:18:08.360 --> 02:18:09.820]
Clap thing

[02:18:14.460 --> 02:18:16.340]
Clap on

[02:18:16.340 --> 02:18:17.340]
Clap on

[02:18:21.320 --> 02:18:24.840]
Soon it was all over so I had to clean it up

[02:18:24.840 --> 02:18:29.120]
Now I spend all my nights just waiting for the bag who can't get up

[02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:31.520]
She's falling in that

[02:18:32.280 --> 02:18:33.360]
Clap thing

[02:18:33.360 --> 02:18:36.040]
And I hope she can't get up

[02:18:39.140 --> 02:18:41.360]
She's falling in the clap thing

[02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:44.900]
Now I'm gonna clap it up

[02:18:44.900 --> 02:18:44.900]

[02:18:46.900 --> 02:18:46.920]

[02:18:54.800 --> 02:18:56.160]
I'm dying on the hair

[02:18:56.160 --> 02:18:59.220]
I take the ribbon from my hair

[02:18:59.900 --> 02:19:00.580]
What a job

[02:19:00.580 --> 02:19:02.140]
Nice job doc

[02:19:02.140 --> 02:19:03.600]
Shake it loose

[02:19:03.600 --> 02:19:05.080]
And let it fall

[02:19:05.080 --> 02:19:06.940]
Okay I'm sorry I'm just getting emotional

[02:19:06.940 --> 02:19:09.800]
